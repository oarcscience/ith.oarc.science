#### Chapter 49

Jesus passes the second brotherhood test, and receives the second
degree, JUSTICE.  
  
**1.** The Logos did not care to rest; he said, Why wait in this
luxurious room? I need not rest; my Father's work upon me presses
hard.  
**2.** I would go on and learn my lessons all. If there are trials, let
them come, for every victory over self gives added strength.  
**3.** And then the guide led on, and in a chamber, dark as night, was
Jesus placed and left alone; and days were spent in this deep
solitude.  
**4.** And Jesus slept, and in the dead of night a secret door was
opened, and, in priest's attire, two men came in; each carried in his
hand a little flickering lamp.  
**5.** Approaching Jesus, one spoke out and said, Young man, our hearts
are grieved because of what you suffer in these fearful dens, and we
have come as friends to bring you light, and show the way to liberty.  
**6.** We once, like you, were in these dens confined, and thought that
through these weird, uncanny ways we could attain to blessedness and
power;  
**7.** But in a luckful moment we were undeceived, and, making use of
all our strength, we broke our chains, and then we learned that all this
service is corruption in disguise. These priests are criminals just hid
away.  
**8.** They boast in sacrificial rites; they offer to their gods, and
burn them while alive poor birds, and beasts; yea, children, women,
men.  
**9.** And now they keep you here, and, at a certain time, may offer you
in sacrifice.  
**10.** We pray you, brother, break your chains; come, go with us;
accept of freedom while you may.  
**11.** And Jesus said, Your little tapers show the light you bring.
Pray, who are you? The words of man are worth no more than is the man
himself.  
**12.** These temple walls are strong and high; how gained you entrance
to this place?  
**13.** The men replied, Beneath these walls are many hidden ways, and
we who have been priests, spent months and years within these dens, know
all of them.  
**14.** Then you are traitors, Jesus said. A traitor is a fiend; he who
betrays another man is never man to trust.  
**15.** If one has only reached the plane of treachery, he is a lover of
deceit, and will betray a friend to serve his selfish self.  
**16.** Behold, you men, or whatsoe'er you be, your words fall lightly
on my ears,  
**17.** Could I prejudge these hundred priests, turn traitor to myself
and them, because of what you say when you confess your treachery?  
**18.** No man can judge for me; and if I judge till testimony all is in
I might not judge aright.  
**19.** Nay, men; by whatsoever way you came, return. My soul prefers
the darkness of the grave to little flickering lights like these you
bring.  
**20.** My conscience rules; what these, my brothers, have to say I'll
hear, and when the testimony all is in I will decide. You cannot judge
for me, nor I for you,  
**21.** Begone, you men, begone, and leave me to this charming light;
for while the sun shines not, within my soul there is a light surpassing
that of sun or moon.  
**22.** Then, with an angry threat that they would do him harm, the wily
tempters left, and Jesus was again alone.  
**23.** Again the white-robed priest appeared, and led the way, and
Jesus stood again before the hierophant;  
**24.** And not a word was said, but in his hands the master placed a
scroll on which the word suggestive, JUSTICE, was inscribed.  
**25.** And Jesus was the master of the phantom forms of prejudice and
of treachery.
