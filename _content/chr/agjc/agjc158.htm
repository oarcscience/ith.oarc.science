<p></p> <h4>Chapter 155</h4> <i>
<p>Jesus recognises the justice of paying secular taxes. He teaches a lesson on family relationships in the life beyond. The greatest of the commandments is comprised in love. He warns his disciples against the hypocrisy of scribes and Pharisees.</i><br> <br> <b>1. </b>As Jesus spoke, the Pharisees came up to question him; they thought to criminate him by what he said,<br> <b>2. </b>A strict Herodian spoke and said, My Lord, you are a man of truth; you show the way to God, and you do not regard the personality of men;<br> <b>3. </b>Tell us, what do you think; should we, who are the seed of Abraham, pay tribute unto C&aelig;sar? or should we not?<br> <b>4. </b>And Jesus knew his wickedness of heart and said, Why do you come to tempt me thus? Show me the tribute money that you speak about.<br> <b>5. </b>The man brought forth a piece of coin on which an image was engraved.<br> <b>6. </b>And Jesus said, Whose image and whose name is on this coin?<br> <b>7. </b>The man replied, 'Tis C&aelig;sar's image and his name.<br> <b>8. </b>And Jesus said, Give unto C&aelig;sar that which is C&aelig;sar's own; but give to God the things of God.<br> <b>9. </b>And they who heard him said, He answers well.<br> <b>10. </b>And then a Sadducee, who thinks there is no resurrection of the dead, came up and said, Rabboni, Moses wrote that if a married man shall die, and have no child, his widow shall become his brother's wife.<br> <b>11. </b>Now, there were seven brothers and the eldest had a wife; he died and had no child; a brother took his widow for his wife, and then he died;<br> <b>12. </b>And every brother had this woman for his wife; in course of time the woman died;<br> <b>13. </b>Now which will have this woman for a wife in the resurrection day?<br> <b>14. </b>And Jesus said, Here in this plane of life men marry just to gratify their selfish selfs, or to perpetuate the race; but in the world to come, and in the resurrection day, men do not take upon themselves the marriage vows.<br> <b>15. </b>But, like the angels and the other sons of God, they form not unions for the pleasure of the self, nor to perpetuate the race.<br> <b>16. </b>Death does not mean the end of life. The grave is not the goal of men, no more than is the earth the goal of seeds.<br> <b>17. </b>Life is the consequence of death. The seed may seem to die, but from its grave the tree arises into life.<br> <b>18. </b>So man may seem to die, but he lives on, and from the grave he springs up into life.<br> <b>19. </b>If you could comprehend the word that Moses spoke about the burning bush that burned and still was not consumed, then you would know that death cannot destroy the life.<br> <b>20. </b>And Moses said that God is God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel.<br> <b>21. </b>God is not God of dead men's bones, but the living man.<br> <b>22. </b>I tell you, men, man goes down to the grave, but he will rise again and manifest the life;<br> <b>23. </b>For every life is hid with Christ in God, and man shall live while God shall live.<br> <b>24. </b>The Pharisees and scribes who heard the Lord, exclaimed, He speaks the truth; and they were glad to have the Sadducees discomfited.<br> <b>25. </b>And then an honest scribe came forth and said to Jesus, Lord, you speak as one whom God has sent, and may I ask,<br> <b>26. </b>Which is the greatest and the first of the Commandments of the Law?<br> <b>27. </b>And Jesus said, The first is Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul, with all your strength;<br> <b>28. </b>And you shall love your neighbour as yourself.<br> <b>29. </b>These are the greatest of the ten, and on them hang the Law, the Prophets and the Psalms.<br> <b>30. </b>The scribe replied, My soul gives witness that you speak the truth, for love fulfils the law, and far transcends burnt offerings and sacrifice.<br> <b>31. </b>And Jesus said to him, Lo, you have solved a mystery; you are within the kingdom and the kingdom is in you.<br> <b>32. </b>To his disciples Jesus spoke, and all the people heard; he said, Beware you of the scribes and Pharisees who pride themselves in wearing long and richly decorated robes,<br> <b>33. </b>And Love to be saluted in the market place, and seek the highest seats at feasts, and take the hard-earned wages of the poor to satisfy their carnal selves, and pray in public, long and loud.<br> <b>34. </b>These are the wolves who clothe themselves to look like sheep.<br> <b>35. </b>And then he said to all, The scribes and Pharisees are placed by law in Moses' seat, and by the law they interpret law;<br> <b>36. </b>So what they bid you do, that do; but do not imitate their deeds.<br> <b>37. </b>They say the things that Moses taught; they do the things of Beelzebul.<br> <b>38. </b>They talk of mercy, yet they bind on human shoulders burdens grievous to bear.<br> <b>39. </b>They talk of helpfulness, and yet they put not forth the slightest helpful efforts for their brother man.<br> <b>40. </b>They make a show of doing things, and yet they do not anything but show their gaudy robes, and broad phylacteries, and smile when people call them honoured masters of the law.<br> <b>41. </b>They strut about and show their pride when people call them father, so and so.<br> <b>42. </b>Hear, now, you men, Call no man father here. The God of heaven and earth, and he alone, is Father of the race of men.<br> <b>43. </b>Christ is the hierarch, the high, exalted master of the sons of men.<br> <b>44. </b>If you would be exalted, sit down at the master's feet and serve. He is the greatest man who serves the best.</p>
