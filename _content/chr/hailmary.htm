<P>The Ave Maria (Hail Mary) is one of the oldest and most popular
Catholic prayers.  Of unknown origin, it was not
officially incorporated into the liturgy (as part of the Rosary) 
until the 15th Century.</P>

<P>AVE Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta tu in mulieribus, et
benedictus fructus ventris tui, Iesus. Sancta Maria, Mater
Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc, et in hora mortis
nostrae. Amen.</P>

<P>HAIL Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women

our death. Amen.</P>
