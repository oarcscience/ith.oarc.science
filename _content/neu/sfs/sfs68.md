# CROATIAN STORIES.

THE Croats are believed to take their name from their former abode in
the ancient Chrobatia, north of the Carpathian Mountains, whose name
retains the same root, CRB(or P)T. Among them we meet with a wonderful
hero, 'Marko' ([No. 52](sfs69.htm#an_52)), the account of whose
*buzdovan*, or mace, the southern representative of Thor's hammer, may
be compared with 'Little Rolling-pea's *bulava* ([No.
22](sfs31.htm#an_22)), and that of 'Ivan Popyalof' (Ralston, p. 66).
Marko appears to have been a very unprincipled hero, with very slight
ideas of honesty and fair-play. He is represented as gaining his vast
strength from a superhuman source--a Vila, of whom more anon. In [No.
53](sfs70.htm#an_53), we are carried into cloudland, and meet with
representatives of the 'Clashing Rocks' (Symplegades), through which the
good ship *Argo* had to pass before she could make her way into the
Black Sea, and which, till their reappearance in this story, seem to
have dropped altogether out of folklore. From this story, and also from
several incidents in [No. 52](sfs69.htm#an_52), we perceive that the
Vilas of the South Slavonians are not denizens of the earth, the waters,
or the woods, but of the clouds, and thus a journey has to be made into
cloudland to find the daughter of their king. <span

wonderful ring and lamp, although animals play a part in it unknown to
the Oriental tale. [No. 55](sfs72.htm#an_55) introduces us to the
singular relations supposed to exist between human beings and wolves,
and [No. 56](sfs73.htm#an_56) exhibits a curious mixture of destiny and
ingenuity.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_17"></span>[265:\*](sfs68.htm#fr_17) It must also be
noticed that the hero is represented as catching the Storm-mare, just as
Bellerophon does the horse Pegasus by the fountain Peirene.
