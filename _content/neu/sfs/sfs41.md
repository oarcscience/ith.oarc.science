### XXX.--TRANSFORMATION INTO A NIGHTINGALE AND A CUCKOO.

A DAMSEL fell in love with a snake, and was also beloved by him. He took
her to wife. His dwelling was of pure glass, all crystal. This dwelling
was situated underground, in a kind of mound, or something of the sort.
Well, it is said

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

that her old mother at first grieved over her. How could she help doing
so? Well, when the time came, the snake's wife became the mother of
twins, a boy and a girl; they looked, as they lay by their mother, as if
they were made of wax. And she was herself as beautiful as a flower.
Well, God having given her children, she said: 'Now, then, since they
have been born as human beings, let us christen them among human
beings.' She took her seat in a golden carriage, laid the children on
her knees, and drove off to the village to the pope. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10) The carriage had not got into the open
country, when sadness was brought to the mother. The old woman had made
an outcry in the whole village, seized a sickle, and rushed into the
country. She saw she had manifest death before her, when she called to
her children, and went on to say: 'Fly, my children, as birds about the
world: you, my little son, as a nightingale, and you, my daughter, as a
cuckoo.' Out flew a nightingale from the carriage by the right-hand, and
a cuckoo by the left-hand window. What became of the carriage and horses
and all nobody knows. Nor did their mistress remain, only a dead nettle
sprang up by the roadside.
