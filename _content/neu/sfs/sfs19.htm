<p>THE Upper Lusatian language is spoken in a district which may be marked by the towns of L&ouml;bau, Bautzen, and Muskau, while the Lower Lusatians dwell round the towns of Spremberg and Kottbus. Of the Upper Lusatians the larger portion live in Saxony and the smaller in Prussian territory; the Lower Lusatians are all Prussian subjects.</p>  
<p>The <A HREF="sfs20.htm#an_14">Upper Lusatian story</A> illustrates, in folklore style, a moral principle of great value. The <A HREF="sfs21.htm#an_15">Lower Lusatian tale</A> is a variant of our own 'Little Red Ridinghood.' But it completes the story in such a manner as to explain the allegorical meaning of the narrative in the sense in which I am inclined to interpret it, as will be shown at the conclusion of the story.</p>  
<p>But the Slavonic remnant in Lusatia is so surrounded by German territory, that most of its folklore has already been pressed into the service of the Germans.</p>  
<p>A remarkable point in the Lusatian language is the completeness of the dual number in both nouns, adjectives, and verbs.</p>
