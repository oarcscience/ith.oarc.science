### XXXI.--TRANSMIGRATION OF THE SOUL.

A CERTAIN woman had a kind of adventure. When she went out into the
field to cut grass, or to fetch hemp, and placed food in the stove, then
somebody took the victuals out of the stove, and ate them all clean up.
She thought, what might such a thing as this signify? Nohow could she
guess it. She came, the door was shut, and there was only remaining in
the house a baby--maybe half a year old--in the cradle. Well, she betook
herself to a wise woman. She entreated her and paid her to come, and she
came. She

looked about, she snuffed about--I mean the wise woman. All at once she
heard something indefinite. 'Go you,' she said, 'into the field, and
I'll hide myself and we'll see what this is.' The woman went into the
field, and the wise woman hid herself in a corner, and kept a look-out.
Then, pop! the baby jumped out of the cradle! She looked, and it was no
more a baby, but an old man. He was quite dwarfish, and his beard was
long. In a moment he was after the eatables, pulled the victuals out of
the stove, then gave a screech, and began to gobble up the food. When he
had devoured all, then he became a baby again; but now he didn't crawl
into the cradle, but lay down, and screeched till the whole house rang.
Then the wise woman was after him: she placed him on a block of wood,
and began to chop the block under his feet. He screeched and she
chopped: he screeched and she chopped. Then she saw how, taking an
opportunity, he became an old man again, and said: 'Old woman, I have
transformed myself not once nor twice only: I was first a fish, then I
became a bird, an ant, and a quadruped, and now I have once more made
trial of being a human being. It isn't better thus than being among the
ants; but among human beings--it isn't worse!'
