# CHAP. LXXV.

Thorbiorn Angle goes to Drangey to speak with Grettir.

WHENAS summer was far spent, Thorbiorn Angle went with a well-manned
barge out to Drangey, and Grettir and his fellows stood forth on the
cliff's edge; so there they talked together. Thorbiorn prayed Grettir to
do so much for his word, as to depart from the island; Grettir said
there was no hope of such an end.

Then said Thorbiorn, "Belike I may give thee meet aid if thou dost this,
for now have many bonders given up to me their shares in the island."

Grettir answered, "Now hast thou shown forth that which brings me to
settle in my mind that I will never go hence, whereas thou sayest that
thou now hast the more part of the island; and good is it that we twain
alone share the kale; for in sooth, hard I found it to have all the men
of Skagafirth against me; but now let neither spare the other, for not
such are we twain, as are like to be smothered in the friendship of men;
and thou mayst leave coming hither, for on my side is all over and
done."

"*All things bide their day*," said Thorbiorn, "and an ill day thou
bidest."

"I am content to risk it," said Grettir; and in such wise they parted,
and Thorbiorn went home.
