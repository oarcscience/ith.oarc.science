<P>NOW it is to be told of Onund Treefoot that he drave out to sea for certain days, but at last the wind got round to the north, and they sailed for land: then those knew who had been there before that they had come west off the Skagi; then they sailed into Strand-Bay, and near to the South-Strands, and there rowed toward them six men in a ten-oared boat, who bailed the big ship, and asked who was their captain; Onund named himself, and asked whence they came; they said they were house-carles of Thorvald, from Drangar; Onund asked if all land through the Strands had been settled; they said there was little unsettled in the inner Strands, and none north thereof. Then</P>

<P>Onund asked his shipmates, whether they would make for the west country, or take such as they had been told of; they chose to view the land first. So they sailed in up the bay, and brought to in a creek off Arness, then put forth a boat and rowed to land. There dwelt a rich man, Eric Snare, who had taken land betwixt Ingolfs-firth, and Wayless in Fishless; but when Eric knew that Onund was come there, he bade him take of his hands whatso he would, but said that there was little that had not been settled before. Onund said he would first see what there was; so they went landward south past some firths, till they came to Wayless; then said Eric, "Here is what there is to look to; all from here is unsettled, and right in to the settlements of Bjorn." Now a great mountain went down the eastern side of the firth, and snow had fallen thereon, Onund looked on that mountain, and sang--</P><DIR>

<P>"Brand-whetter's life awry doth go.<BR>
Fair lands and wide full well I know;<BR>
Past house, and field, and fold of man,<BR>
The swift steed of the rollers ran:<BR>
My lands, and kin, I left behind,<BR>
That I this latter day might find,<BR>
Coldback for sunny meads to have;<BR>
Hard fate a bitter bargain drave."</P></DIR>

<P>Eric answered, "Many have lost so much in Norway, that it may not be bettered: and I think withal that most lands in the main-settlements are already settled, and therefore I urge thee not to go from hence; but I shall hold to what I spake, that thou mayst have whatso of my lands seems meet to thee." Onund said, that he would take that offer, and so he settled land out from Wayless over the three</P>

<P>creeks, Byrgis-Creek, Kolbein's-Creek, and Coldback-Creek, up to Coldback-Cleft. Thereafter Eric gave him all Fishless, and Reekfirth, and all Reekness, out on that side of the firth; but as to drifts there was nought set forth, for they were then so plentiful that every man had of them what he would. Now Onund set up a household at Coldback, and had many men about him; but when his goods began to grow great he had another stead in Reekfirth. Kolbein dwelt at Kolbein's-Creek. So Onund abode in peace for certain winters.</P>
