<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Grettir outlawed at the Thing at the Suit of Thorir of Garth</I>.</P>
<P>THIS summer, whereof the tale was telling e'en now, a ship came out to Goose-ere before the Thing. Then</P>
<P><A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A></P>
<P>was the news told of Grettir's travels, and therewithal men spake of that house-burning; and at that story was Thorir of Garth mad wroth, and deemed that there whereas Grettir was he had to look for vengeance for his sons. He rode with many men and set forth at the Thing the case for the burning, but men deemed they knew nought to say therein, while there was none to answer.</P>
<P>Thorir said that he would have nought, but that Grettir should be made an outlaw throughout the land for such misdeeds.</P>
<P>Then answered Skapti the Lawman, "Surely an ill deed it is, if things are as is said; but a tale is half told if one man tells it, for most folk are readiest to bring their stories to the worser side when there are two ways of telling them; now, therefore, I shall not give my word that Grettir be made guilty for this that has been done."</P>
<P>Now Thorir was a man of might in his district and a great chief, and well befriended of many great men; and he pushed on matters so hard that nought could avail to acquit Grettir; and so this Thorir made Grettir an outlaw throughout all the land, and was ever thenceforth the heaviest of all his foes, as things would oft show.</P>
<P>Now he put a price on his head, as was wont to be done with other wood-folk, and thereafter rode home.</P>
<P>Many men got saying that this was done rather by the high hand than according to law; but so it stood as it was done; and now nought else happed to tell of till past midsummer.</P>
