<P>A life scarce worth the living, a poor fame<BR>
Scarce worth the winning, in a wretched land,<BR>
Where fear and pain go upon either hand,<BR>
As toward the end men fare without an aim<BR>
Unto the dull grey dark from whence they came:<BR>
Let them alone, the unshadowed sheer rocks stand<BR>
Over the twilight graves of that poor band,<BR>
Who count so little in the great world's game!</P>
<P>Nay, with the dead I deal not; this man lives,<BR>
And that which carried him through good and ill,<BR>
Stem against fate while his voice echoed still<BR>
From rock to rock, now he lies silent, strives<BR>
With wasting time, and through its long lapse gives<BR>
Another friend to me, life's void to fill.</P>
