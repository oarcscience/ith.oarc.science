# CHAP. XXXVI.

Of Thorbiorn Oxmain's Autumn-feast, and the mocks of Thorbiorn Tardy.

THORBIORN Oxmain held a great autumn feast, and many men came thither to
him, and that was while Grettir fared north to Waterdale in the autumn;
Thorbiorn the Tardy was there at the feast, and many things were spoken
of there. There the Ramfirthers asked of those dealings of Grettir on
the neck the summer before.

Thorbiorn Oxmain told the story right fairly as towards Grettir, and
said that Kormak would have got the worst of it, if none had come there
to part them.

Then spake Thorbiorn the Tardy, "Both these things are true," said he:
"I saw Grettir win no great honour, and I deem withal that fear shot
through his heart when we came thereto, and right blithe was he to part,
nor did I see him seek for vengeance when Atli's house-carle was slain,
therefore do I deem that there is no heart in him if he is not holpen
enow."

And thereat Thorbiorn went on gabbling at his most; but many put in a
word, and said that this was worthless fooling, and that Grettir would
not leave things thus, if he heard that talk.

Nought else befell worth telling of at the feast, and men went home; but
much ill-will there was betwixt them that winter, though neither set on
other; nor were there other tidings through the winter.
