This is one of the few Magnusson and Morris Icelandic Saga translations
which has yet to be converted to etext as of 2003. I like this
translation much better than the 1914 Hight translation, (available in
etext as the Online Medieval and Classical Library release \#9). Morris
is one of the great stylists of the fantasy field, and his
pseudo-archaic language just feels right for this meaty story of revenge
served up hot and cold. In addition, there is a gorgeous [map of
North-west Iceland](gre05) which, although it isn't signed, was probably
drawn by Morris.

The protagonist, Grettir Asmudson, is a bad seed, a loner, a thief, a
grave-robber, and a murderer. On the plus side, he has an incredible
tolerance for pain and an uncanny ability to extemporize poetry.
Grettir's poor anger management starts a cycle of revenge. In spite of
some heroic deeds (particularly an almost cinematic confrontation with
some berserkers), Grettir gets a bad reputation which he is never able
to shake off. Grettir has several encounters with supernatural beings:
ghosts, trolls and liches. The pivot of the story is a particularly
bloodthirsty ghost who fortells Grettir's doom when he vanquishes it.

This is a tragic story told from a perspective that is just outside our
modern conventions of storytelling. Grettir lived just on the cusp of
the introduction of Christianity in Iceland, at a time when the ancient
customs of blood-money and vendetta still held. There is no redemption
for Grettir, even though his character evolves over the course of the
story arc. Grettir is banished from society for most of his life.
Towards the end almost everyone he comes in contact with eventually
tries to betray him. In the end, it takes dire witchcraft and a small
army of men to bring Grettir down. *--J.B. Hare*
