# CHAP. LXXVII.

Grettir at the Home-stead of Reeks.

NOW Grettir got all ready for swimming, and had on a cowl of
market-wadmal, and his breeches girt about him, and he got his fingers
webbed together, and the weather was fair. So he went from the island
late in the day, and desperate Illugi deemed his journey. Grettir made
out into the bay, and the stream was with him, and a calm was over all.
He swam on fast, and came aland at Reekness by then the sun had set: he
went up to the homestead at Reeks, and into a bath that night, and then
went into the chamber; it was very warm there, for there had been a fire
therein that evening, and the heat was not yet out of the place; but he
was exceeding weary, and there fell into a deep sleep, and so lay till
far on into the next day.

Now as the morning wore the home folk arose, and two women came into the
chamber, a handmaid and the goodman's daughter. Grettir was asleep, and
the bedclothes

had been cast off him on to the floor; so they saw that a man lay there,
and knew him.

Then said the handmaiden: "So may I thrive, sister! here is Grettir
Asmundson lying bare, and I call him right well ribbed about the chest,
but few might think he would be so small of growth below; and so then
that does not go along with other kinds of bigness."

The goodman's daughter answered: "Why wilt thou have everything on thy
tongue's end? Thou art a measureless fool; be still."

"Dear sister, how can I be still about it?" says the handmaid. "I would
not have believed it, though one had told me."

And now she would whiles run up to him and look, and whiles run back
again to the goodman's daughter, screaming and laughing; but Grettir
heard what she said, and as she ran in over the floor by him he caught
hold of her, and sang this stave--

"Stay a little, foolish one!  
When the shield-shower is all done,  
With the conquered carles and lords,  
Men bide not to measure swords:  
Many a man had there been glad,  
Lesser war-gear to have had.  
With a heart more void of fear;  
Such I am not, sweet and dear."

Therewithal he swept her up into the bed, but the bonder's daughter ran
out of the place; then sang Grettir this other stave--

"Sweet amender of the seam,  
Weak and worn thou dost me deem: <span id="page_222">p. 222</span>  
O light-handed dear delight,  
Certes thou must say aright.  
Weak I am, and certainly  
Long in white arms must I lie:  
Hast thou heart to leave me then,  
Fair-limbed gladdener of great men?"

The handmaid shrieked out, but in such wise did they part that she laid
no blame on Grettir when all was over.

A little after, Grettir arose, and went to Thorvald the goodman, and
told him of his trouble, and prayed bring him out; so did he, and lent
him a boat, and brought him out, and Grettir thanked him well for his
manliness.

But when it was heard that Grettir had swam a sea-mile, all deemed his
prowess both on sea and land to be marvellous.

Those of Skagafirth had many words to say against Thorbiorn Angle, in
that he drave not Grettir away from Drangey, and said they would take
back each his own share; but he said he found the task no easy one, and
prayed them be good to him, and abide awhile.
