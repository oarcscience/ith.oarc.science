This book, despite its title, is a treasure-trove of Slavic mythology,
tradition, folklore and ethnography. There *are* plenty of songs, not
only from Russia but every part of the Slavic region from Serbia to
Siberia. The songs are used as a starting point for a wide-ranging
discussion of pre-industrial Slavic peasant life, including weddings,
funerals, witchcraft, demonology, games, riddles, and seasonal
traditions. Also covered are the details of Russian pagan religion and
mythology, with comparisons to related topics such as Vedic and Germanic
mythology.

Lacking are samples or analysis of the songs in the original language
(except for a very brief treatment in appendix B), and there are no
musical transcriptions or descriptions of dance. However, the massive,
well documented, and very entertaining collection of Slavic traditions
in this book more than makes up for this deficiency.
