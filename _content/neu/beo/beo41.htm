<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XLII</H1>
A PERILOUS path, it proved, he[1] trod<BR>
who heinously hid, that hall within,<BR>
wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed<BR>
one of a few,[2] and the feud was avenged<BR>
in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,<BR>
what manner a man of might and valor<BR>
oft ends his life, when the earl no longer<BR>
in mead-hall may live with loving friends.<BR>
So Beowulf, when that barrow's warden<BR>
he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not<BR>
in what wise he should wend from the world at last.<BR>
For[3] princes potent, who placed the gold,<BR>
with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,<BR>
so that marked with sin the man should be,<BR>
hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,<BR>
racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard.<BR>
Yet no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven,<BR>
ever the king had kept in view.[4]<BR>
Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:--<BR>
"At the mandate of one, oft warriors many<BR>
sorrow must suffer; and so must we.<BR>
The people's-shepherd showed not aught<BR>
of care for our counsel, king beloved!<BR>
That guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,<BR>
but let him lie where he long had been<BR>
in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world,<BR>
the hest of heaven. -- This hoard is ours<BR>
but grievously gotten; too grim the fate<BR>
which thither carried our king and lord.<BR>
I was within there, and all I viewed,<BR>
the chambered treasure, when chance allowed me<BR>
(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)<BR>
under the earth-wall. Eager, I seized<BR>
such heap from the hoard as hands could bear<BR>
and hurriedly carried it hither back<BR>
to my liege and lord. Alive was he still,<BR>
still wielding his wits. The wise old man<BR>
spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings<BR>
and bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,<BR>
on the place of his balefire a barrow high,<BR>
memorial mighty. Of men was he<BR>
worthiest warrior wide earth o'er<BR>
the while he had joy of his jewels and burg.<BR>
Let us set out in haste now, the second time<BR>
to see and search this store of treasure,<BR>
these wall-hid wonders, -- the way I show you, --<BR>
where, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill<BR>
at broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made,<BR>
be all in order when out we come,<BR>
our king and captain to carry thither<BR>
-- man beloved -- where long he shall bide<BR>
safe in the shelter of sovran God."<BR>
Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command,<BR>
hardy chief, to heroes many<BR>
that owned their homesteads, hither to bring<BR>
firewood from far -- o'er the folk they ruled --<BR>
for the famed-one's funeral. " Fire shall devour<BR>
and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior<BR>
who oft stood stout in the iron-shower,<BR>
when, sped from the string, a storm of arrows<BR>
shot o'er the shield-wall: the shaft held firm,<BR>
featly feathered, followed the barb."<BR>
And now the sage young son of Weohstan<BR>
seven chose of the chieftain's thanes,<BR>
the best he found that band within,<BR>
and went with these warriors, one of eight,<BR>
under hostile roof. In hand one bore<BR>
a lighted torch and led the way.<BR>
No lots they cast for keeping the hoard<BR>
when once the warriors saw it in hall,<BR>
altogether without a guardian,<BR>
lying there lost. And little they mourned<BR>
when they had hastily haled it out,<BR>
dear-bought treasure! The dragon they cast,<BR>
the worm, o'er the wall for the wave to take,<BR>
and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.<BR>
Then the woven gold on a wain was laden --<BR>
countless quite! -- and the king was borne,<BR>
hoary hero, to Hrones-Ness.<BR>

[1] Probably the fugitive is meant who discovered the hoard. Ten Brink
and Gering assume that the dragon is meant. "Hid" may well mean here
"took while in hiding."<BR>
[2] That is "one and a few others." But Beowulf seems to be indicated.<BR>
[3] Ten Brink points out the strongly heathen character of this part of the
epic. Beowulf's end came, so the old tradition ran, from his unwitting
interference with spell-bound treasure.<BR>
[4] A hard saying, variously interpreted. In any case, it is the somewhat clumsy effort of the Christian poet to tone down the heathenism of
his material by an edifying observation.<BR>
