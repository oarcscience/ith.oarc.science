<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">VI</H1>
HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings:--<BR>
"I knew him of yore in his youthful days;<BR>
his aged father was Ecgtheow named,<BR>
to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat<BR>
his only daughter. Their offspring bold<BR>
fares hither to seek the steadfast friend.<BR>
And seamen, too, have said me this, --<BR>
who carried my gifts to the Geatish court,<BR>
thither for thanks, -- he has thirty men's<BR>
heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand,<BR>
the bold-in-battle. Blessed God<BR>
out of his mercy this man hath sent<BR>
to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed,<BR>
against horror of Grendel. I hope to give<BR>
the good youth gold for his gallant thought.<BR>
Be thou in haste, and bid them hither,<BR>
clan of kinsmen, to come before me;<BR>
and add this word, -- they are welcome guests<BR>
to folk of the Danes."<BR>
[To the door of the hall<BR>
Wulfgar went] and the word declared:--<BR>
"To you this message my master sends,<BR>
East-Danes' king, that your kin he knows,<BR>
hardy heroes, and hails you all<BR>
welcome hither o'er waves of the sea!<BR>
Ye may wend your way in war-attire,<BR>
and under helmets Hrothgar greet;<BR>
but let here the battle-shields bide your parley,<BR>
and wooden war-shafts wait its end."<BR>
Uprose the mighty one, ringed with his men,<BR>
brave band of thanes: some bode without,<BR>
battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief.<BR>
Then hied that troop where the herald led them,<BR>
under Heorot's roof: [the hero strode,]<BR>
hardy 'neath helm, till the hearth he neared.<BR>
Beowulf spake, -- his breastplate gleamed,<BR>
war-net woven by wit of the smith:--<BR>
"Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac's I,<BR>
kinsman and follower. Fame a plenty<BR>
have I gained in youth! These Grendel-deeds<BR>
I heard in my home-land heralded clear.<BR>
Seafarers say how stands this hall,<BR>
of buildings best, for your band of thanes<BR>
empty and idle, when evening sun<BR>
in the harbor of heaven is hidden away.<BR>
So my vassals advised me well, --<BR>
brave and wise, the best of men, --<BR>
O sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here,<BR>
for my nerve and my might they knew full well.<BR>
Themselves had seen me from slaughter come<BR>
blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound,<BR>
and that wild brood worsted. I' the waves I slew<BR>
nicors[1] by night, in need and peril<BR>
avenging the Weders,[2] whose woe they sought, --<BR>
crushing the grim ones. Grendel now,<BR>
monster cruel, be mine to quell<BR>
in single battle! So, from thee,<BR>
thou sovran of the Shining-Danes,<BR>
Scyldings'-bulwark, a boon I seek, --<BR>
and, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not,<BR>
O Warriors'-shield, now I've wandered far, --<BR>
that I alone with my liegemen here,<BR>
this hardy band, may Heorot purge!<BR>
More I hear, that the monster dire,<BR>
in his wanton mood, of weapons recks not;<BR>
hence shall I scorn -- so Hygelac stay,<BR>
king of my kindred, kind to me! --<BR>
brand or buckler to bear in the fight,<BR>
gold-colored targe: but with gripe alone<BR>
must I front the fiend and fight for life,<BR>
foe against foe. Then faith be his<BR>
in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take.<BR>
Fain, I ween, if the fight he win,<BR>
in this hall of gold my Geatish band<BR>
will he fearless eat, -- as oft before, --<BR>
my noblest thanes. Nor need'st thou then<BR>
to hide my head;[3] for his shall I be,<BR>
dyed in gore, if death must take me;<BR>
and my blood-covered body he'll bear as prey,<BR>
ruthless devour it, the roamer-lonely,<BR>
with my life-blood redden his lair in the fen:<BR>
no further for me need'st food prepare!<BR>
To Hygelac send, if Hild[4] should take me,<BR>
best of war-weeds, warding my breast,<BR>
armor excellent, heirloom of Hrethel<BR>
and work of Wayland.[5] Fares Wyrd[6] as she must."<BR>

[1] The nicor, says Bugge, is a hippopotamus; a walrus, says ten Brink.
But that water-goblin who covers the space from Old Nick of jest to the
Neckan and Nix of poetry and tale, is all one needs, and Nicor is a good
name for him.<BR>
[2] His own people, the Geats.<BR>
[3] That is, cover it as with a face-cloth. "There will be no need of
funeral rites."<BR>
[4] Personification of Battle.<BR>
[5] The Germanic Vulcan.<BR>
[6] This mighty power, whom the Christian poet can still revere, has here
the general force of "Destiny."<BR>
