<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XLI</H1>
"THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats<BR>
and the storm of their strife, were seen afar,<BR>
how folk against folk the fight had wakened.<BR>
The ancient king with his atheling band<BR>
sought his citadel, sorrowing much:<BR>
Ongentheow earl went up to his burg.<BR>
He had tested Hygelac's hardihood,<BR>
the proud one's prowess, would prove it no longer,<BR>
defied no more those fighting-wanderers<BR>
nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard,<BR>
his bairn and his bride: so he bent him again,<BR>
old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came<BR>
with slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac<BR>
o'er peaceful plains in pride advancing,<BR>
till Hrethelings fought in the fenced town.[1]<BR>
Then Ongentheow with edge of sword,<BR>
the hoary-bearded, was held at bay,<BR>
and the folk-king there was forced to suffer<BR>
Eofor's anger. In ire, at the king<BR>
Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck;<BR>
and the chieftain's blood, for that blow, in streams<BR>
flowed 'neath his hair. No fear felt he,<BR>
stout old Scylfing, but straightway repaid<BR>
in better bargain that bitter stroke<BR>
and faced his foe with fell intent.<BR>
Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred<BR>
answer to render the aged chief;<BR>
too soon on his head the helm was cloven;<BR>
blood-bedecked he bowed to earth,<BR>
and fell adown; not doomed was he yet,<BR>
and well he waxed, though the wound was sore.<BR>
Then the hardy Hygelac-thane,[2]<BR>
when his brother fell, with broad brand smote,<BR>
giants' sword crashing through giants'-helm<BR>
across the shield-wall: sank the king,<BR>
his folk's old herdsman, fatally hurt.<BR>
There were many to bind the brother's wounds<BR>
and lift him, fast as fate allowed<BR>
his people to wield the place-of-war.<BR>
But Eofor took from Ongentheow,<BR>
earl from other, the iron-breastplate,<BR>
hard sword hilted, and helmet too,<BR>
and the hoar-chief's harness to Hygelac carried,<BR>
who took the trappings, and truly promised<BR>
rich fee 'mid folk, -- and fulfilled it so.<BR>
For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord,<BR>
Hrethel's offspring, when home he came,<BR>
to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure,<BR>
Each of them had a hundred thousand[3]<BR>
in land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned<BR>
mid-earth men such mighty deeds!<BR>
And to Eofor he gave his only daughter<BR>
in pledge of grace, the pride of his home.<BR>
"Such is the feud, the foeman's rage,<BR>
death-hate of men: so I deem it sure<BR>
that the Swedish folk will seek us home<BR>
for this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings,<BR>
when once they learn that our warrior leader<BR>
lifeless lies, who land and hoard<BR>
ever defended from all his foes,<BR>
furthered his folk's weal, finished his course<BR>
a hardy hero. -- Now haste is best,<BR>
that we go to gaze on our Geatish lord,<BR>
and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings<BR>
to the funeral pyre. No fragments merely<BR>
shall burn with the warrior. Wealth of jewels,<BR>
gold untold and gained in terror,<BR>
treasure at last with his life obtained,<BR>
all of that booty the brands shall take,<BR>
fire shall eat it. No earl must carry<BR>
memorial jewel. No maiden fair<BR>
shall wreathe her neck with noble ring:<BR>
nay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,<BR>
oft shall she pass o'er paths of exile<BR>
now our lord all laughter has laid aside,<BR>
all mirth and revel. Many a spear<BR>
morning-cold shall be clasped amain,<BR>
lifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp<BR>
those warriors wake; but the wan-hued raven,<BR>
fain o'er the fallen, his feast shall praise<BR>
and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate<BR>
when he and the wolf were wasting the slain."<BR>
So he told his sorrowful tidings,<BR>
and little[4] he lied, the loyal man<BR>
of word or of work. The warriors rose;<BR>
sad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,<BR>
went, welling with tears, the wonder to view.<BR>
Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,<BR>
their lifeless lord, who had lavished rings<BR>
of old upon them. Ending-day<BR>
had dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized<BR>
in woful slaughter the Weders' king.<BR>
There saw they, besides, the strangest being,<BR>
loathsome, lying their leader near,<BR>
prone on the field. The fiery dragon,<BR>
fearful fiend, with flame was scorched.<BR>
Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures<BR>
in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile<BR>
it had revelled by night, and anon come back,<BR>
seeking its den; now in death's sure clutch<BR>
it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.<BR>
By it there stood the stoups and jars;<BR>
dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords<BR>
eaten with rust, as, on earth's lap resting,<BR>
a thousand winters they waited there.<BR>
For all that heritage huge, that gold<BR>
of bygone men, was bound by a spell,[5]<BR>
so the treasure-hall could be touched by none<BR>
of human kind, -- save that Heaven's King,<BR>
God himself, might give whom he would,<BR>
Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, --<BR>
even such a man as seemed to him meet.<BR>

[1] The line may mean: till Hrethelings stormed on the hedged shields, -- i.e. the shield-wall or hedge of defensive war -- Hrethelings, of course, are Geats.<BR>
[2] Eofor, brother to Wulf Wonreding.<BR>
[3] Sc. "value in" hides and the weight of the gold.<BR>
[4] Not at all.<BR>
[5] Laid on it when it was put in the barrow. This spell, or in our days
the "curse," either prevented discovery or brought dire ills on the finder
and taker.<BR>
