# XXVII

CAME now to ocean the ever-courageous  
hardy henchmen, their harness bearing,  
woven war-sarks. The warden marked,  
trusty as ever, the earl's return.  
From the height of the hill no hostile words  
reached the guests as he rode to greet them;  
but "Welcome!" he called to that Weder clan  
as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on.  
Then on the strand, with steeds and treasure  
and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship  
was heavily laden: high its mast  
rose over Hrothgar's hoarded gems.  
A sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,  
mounted with gold; on the mead-bench since  
he was better esteemed, that blade possessing,  
heirloom old. -- Their ocean-keel boarding,  
they drove through the deep, and Daneland left.  
A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,  
firm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned;\[1\]  
nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow  
across from her course. The craft sped on,  
foam-necked it floated forth o'er the waves,  
keel firm-bound over briny currents,  
till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs,  
home-known headlands. High the boat,  
stirred by winds, on the strand updrove.  
Helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood,  
who long already for loved companions  
by the water had waited and watched afar.  
He bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship  
with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows  
that trusty timber should tear away.  
Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure,  
gold and jewels; no journey far  
was it thence to go to the giver of rings,  
Hygelac Hrethling: at home he dwelt  
by the sea-wall close, himself and clan.  
Haughty that house, a hero the king,  
high the hall, and Hygd\[2\] right young,  
wise and wary, though winters few  
in those fortress walls she had found a home,  
Haereth's daughter. Nor humble her ways,  
nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,  
of precious treasure. Not Thryth's pride showed she,  
folk-queen famed, or that fell deceit.  
Was none so daring that durst make bold  
(save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear  
that lady full in the face to look,  
but forged fetters he found his lot,  
bonds of death! And brief the respite;  
soon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken,  
and the burnished blade a baleful murder  
proclaimed and closed. No queenly way  
for woman to practise, though peerless she,  
that the weaver-of-peace\[3\] from warrior dear  
by wrath and lying his life should reave!  
But Hemming's kinsman hindered this. --  
For over their ale men also told  
that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,  
onslaughts of evil, after she went,  
gold-decked bride, to the brave young prince,  
atheling haughty, and Offa's hall  
o'er the fallow flood at her father's bidding  
safely sought, where since she prospered,  
royal, throned, rich in goods,  
fain of the fair life fate had sent her,  
and leal in love to the lord of warriors.  
He, of all heroes I heard of ever  
from sea to sea, of the sons of earth,  
most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised  
for his fighting and feeing by far-off men,  
the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled  
over his empire. Eomer woke to him,  
help of heroes, Hemming's kinsman,  
Grandson of Garmund, grim in war.  
\[1\] With the speed of the boat.  
\[2\] Queen to Hygelac. She is praised by contrast with the antitype,
Thryth, just as Beowulf was praised by contrast with Heremod.  
\[3\] Kenning for "wife."
