<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">III</H1>
THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene<BR>
with the woe of these days; not wisest men<BR>
assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,<BR>
loathly and long, that lay on his folk,<BR>
most baneful of burdens and bales of the night.<BR>
This heard in his home Hygelac's thane,<BR>
great among Geats, of Grendel's doings.<BR>
He was the mightiest man of valor<BR>
in that same day of this our life,<BR>
stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker<BR>
he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,<BR>
far o'er the swan-road he fain would seek,<BR>
the noble monarch who needed men!<BR>
The prince's journey by prudent folk<BR>
was little blamed, though they loved him dear;<BR>
they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.<BR>
And now the bold one from bands of Geats<BR>
comrades chose, the keenest of warriors<BR>
e'er he could find; with fourteen men<BR>
the sea-wood[1] he sought, and, sailor proved,<BR>
led them on to the land's confines.<BR>
Time had now flown;[2] afloat was the ship,<BR>
boat under bluff. On board they climbed,<BR>
warriors ready; waves were churning<BR>
sea with sand; the sailors bore<BR>
on the breast of the bark their bright array,<BR>
their mail and weapons: the men pushed off,<BR>
on its willing way, the well-braced craft.<BR>
Then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind<BR>
that bark like a bird with breast of foam,<BR>
till in season due, on the second day,<BR>
the curved prow such course had run<BR>
that sailors now could see the land,<BR>
sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,<BR>
headlands broad. Their haven was found,<BR>
their journey ended. Up then quickly<BR>
the Weders'[3] clansmen climbed ashore,<BR>
anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing<BR>
and gear of battle: God they thanked<BR>
for passing in peace o'er the paths of the sea.<BR>
Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,<BR>
a warden that watched the water-side,<BR>
how they bore o'er the gangway glittering shields,<BR>
war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him<BR>
to know what manner of men they were.<BR>
Straight to the strand his steed he rode,<BR>
Hrothgar's henchman; with hand of might<BR>
he shook his spear, and spake in parley.<BR>
"Who are ye, then, ye armed men,<BR>
mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel<BR>
have urged thus over the ocean ways,<BR>
here o'er the waters? A warden I,<BR>
sentinel set o'er the sea-march here,<BR>
lest any foe to the folk of Danes<BR>
with harrying fleet should harm the land.<BR>
No aliens ever at ease thus bore them,<BR>
linden-wielders:[4] yet word-of-leave<BR>
clearly ye lack from clansmen here,<BR>
my folk's agreement. -- A greater ne'er saw I<BR>
of warriors in world than is one of you, --<BR>
yon hero in harness! No henchman he<BR>
worthied by weapons, if witness his features,<BR>
his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell<BR>
your folk and home, lest hence ye fare<BR>
suspect to wander your way as spies<BR>
in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar,<BR>
ocean-travellers, take from me<BR>
simple advice: the sooner the better<BR>
I hear of the country whence ye came."<BR>

[1] Ship.<BR>
[2] That is, since Beowulf selected his ship and led his men to the harbor.<BR>
[3] One of the auxiliary names of the Geats.<BR>
[4] Or: Not thus openly ever came warriors hither; yet...<BR>
