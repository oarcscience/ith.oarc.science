UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf,<BR>
who sat at the feet of the Scyldings' lord,<BR>
unbound the battle-runes.[1] -- Beowulf's quest,<BR>
sturdy seafarer's, sorely galled him;<BR>
ever he envied that other men<BR>
should more achieve in middle-earth<BR>
of fame under heaven than he himself. --<BR>
"Art thou that Beowulf, Breca's rival,<BR>
who emulous swam on the open sea,<BR>
when for pride the pair of you proved the floods,<BR>
and wantonly dared in waters deep<BR>
to risk your lives? No living man,<BR>
or lief or loath, from your labor dire<BR>
could you dissuade, from swimming the main.<BR>
Ocean-tides with your arms ye covered,<BR>
with strenuous hands the sea-streets measured,<BR>
swam o'er the waters. Winter's storm<BR>
rolled the rough waves. In realm of sea<BR>
a sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee,<BR>
had more of main! Him at morning-tide<BR>
billows bore to the Battling Reamas,<BR>
whence he hied to his home so dear<BR>
beloved of his liegemen, to land of Brondings,<BR>
fastness fair, where his folk he ruled,<BR>
town and treasure. In triumph o'er thee<BR>
Beanstan's bairn[2] his boast achieved.<BR>
So ween I for thee a worse adventure<BR>
-- though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been,<BR>
in struggle grim, -- if Grendel's approach<BR>
thou darst await through the watch of night!"<BR>
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>
"What a deal hast uttered, dear my Unferth,<BR>
drunken with beer, of Breca now,<BR>
told of his triumph! Truth I claim it,<BR>
that I had more of might in the sea<BR>
than any man else, more ocean-endurance.<BR>
We twain had talked, in time of youth,<BR>
and made our boast, -- we were merely boys,<BR>
striplings still, -- to stake our lives<BR>
far at sea: and so we performed it.<BR>
Naked swords, as we swam along,<BR>
we held in hand, with hope to guard us<BR>
against the whales. Not a whit from me<BR>
could he float afar o'er the flood of waves,<BR>
haste o'er the billows; nor him I abandoned.<BR>
Together we twain on the tides abode<BR>
five nights full till the flood divided us,<BR>
churning waves and chillest weather,<BR>
darkling night, and the northern wind<BR>
ruthless rushed on us: rough was the surge.<BR>
Now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace;<BR>
yet me 'gainst the monsters my mailed coat,<BR>
hard and hand-linked, help afforded, --<BR>
battle-sark braided my breast to ward,<BR>
garnished with gold. There grasped me firm<BR>
and haled me to bottom the hated foe,<BR>
with grimmest gripe. 'Twas granted me, though,<BR>
to pierce the monster with point of sword,<BR>
with blade of battle: huge beast of the sea<BR>
was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine.<BR>
