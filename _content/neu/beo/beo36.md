# XXXVII

'TWAS now, men say, in his sovran's need  
that the earl made known his noble strain,  
craft and keenness and courage enduring.  
Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,  
hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman.  
A little lower the loathsome beast  
he smote with sword; his steel drove in  
bright and burnished; that blaze began  
to lose and lessen. At last the king  
wielded his wits again, war-knife drew,  
a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,  
and the Weders'-helm smote that worm asunder,  
felled the foe, flung forth its life.  
So had they killed it, kinsmen both,  
athelings twain: thus an earl should be  
in danger's day! -- Of deeds of valor  
this conqueror's-hour of the king was last,  
of his work in the world. The wound began,  
which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted,  
to swell and smart; and soon he found  
in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,  
pain of poison. The prince walked on,  
wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;  
then sat, and stared at the structure of giants,  
where arch of stone and steadfast column  
upheld forever that hall in earth.  
Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless  
lave with water his winsome lord,  
the king and conqueror covered with blood,  
with struggle spent, and unspan his helmet.  
Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt,  
his mortal wound; full well he knew  
his portion now was past and gone  
of earthly bliss, and all had fled  
of his file of days, and death was near:  
"I would fain bestow on son of mine  
this gear of war, were given me now  
that any heir should after me come  
of my proper blood. This people I ruled  
fifty winters. No folk-king was there,  
none at all, of the neighboring clans  
who war would wage me with 'warriors'-friends'\[1\]  
and threat me with horrors. At home I bided  
what fate might come, and I cared for mine own;  
feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore  
ever on oath. For all these things,  
though fatally wounded, fain am I!  
From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,  
when life from my frame must flee away,  
for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go  
and gaze on that hoard 'neath the hoary rock,  
Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,  
sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved.  
And fare in haste. I would fain behold  
the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,  
have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down  
softlier for sight of this splendid hoard  
my life and the lordship I long have held."  
\[1\] That is, swords.
