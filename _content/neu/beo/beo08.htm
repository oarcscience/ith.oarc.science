HROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings'-helmet:--<BR>
"For fight defensive, Friend my Beowulf,<BR>
to succor and save, thou hast sought us here.<BR>
Thy father's combat[1] a feud enkindled<BR>
when Heatholaf with hand he slew<BR>
among the Wylfings; his Weder kin<BR>
for horror of fighting feared to hold him.<BR>
Fleeing, he sought our South-Dane folk,<BR>
over surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings,<BR>
when first I was ruling the folk of Danes,<BR>
wielded, youthful, this widespread realm,<BR>
this hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead,<BR>
my elder brother, had breathed his last,<BR>
Healfdene's bairn: he was better than I!<BR>
Straightway the feud with fee[2] I settled,<BR>
to the Wylfings sent, o'er watery ridges,<BR>
treasures olden: oaths he[3] swore me.<BR>
Sore is my soul to say to any<BR>
of the race of man what ruth for me<BR>
in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought,<BR>
what sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me,<BR>
my warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them<BR>
into Grendel's grasp. But God is able<BR>
this deadly foe from his deeds to turn!<BR>
Boasted full oft, as my beer they drank,<BR>
earls o'er the ale-cup, armed men,<BR>
that they would bide in the beer-hall here,<BR>
Grendel's attack with terror of blades.<BR>
Then was this mead-house at morning tide<BR>
dyed with gore, when the daylight broke,<BR>
all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled,<BR>
gory the hall: I had heroes the less,<BR>
doughty dear-ones that death had reft.<BR>
-- But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words,<BR>
hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee."<BR>
Gathered together, the Geatish men<BR>
in the banquet-hall on bench assigned,<BR>
sturdy-spirited, sat them down,<BR>
hardy-hearted. A henchman attended,<BR>
carried the carven cup in hand,<BR>
served the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang<BR>
blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled,<BR>
no dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane.<BR>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
[1] There is no irrelevance here. Hrothgar sees in Beowulf's mission a
heritage of duty, a return of the good offices which the Danish king rendered to Beowulf's father in time of dire need.<BR>
[2] Money, for wergild, or man-price.<BR>
[3] Ecgtheow, Beowulf's sire.<BR>
