"THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants<BR>
alone for his lost. Too large all seems,<BR>
homestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders<BR>
hid in his heart for Herebeald<BR>
waves of woe. No way could he take<BR>
to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul;<BR>
nor e'en could he harass that hero at all<BR>
with loathing deed, though he loved him not.<BR>
And so for the sorrow his soul endured,<BR>
men's gladness he gave up and God's light chose.<BR>
Lands and cities he left his sons<BR>
(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth.<BR>
There was strife and struggle 'twixt Swede and Geat<BR>
o'er the width of waters; war arose,<BR>
hard battle-horror, when Hrethel died,<BR>
and Ongentheow's offspring grew<BR>
strife-keen, bold, nor brooked o'er the seas<BR>
pact of peace, but pushed their hosts<BR>
to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.<BR>
Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance,<BR>
for woful war ('tis widely known),<BR>
though one of them bought it with blood of his heart,<BR>
a bargain hard: for Haethcyn proved<BR>
fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats.<BR>
At morn, I heard, was the murderer killed<BR>
by kinsman for kinsman,[1] with clash of sword,<BR>
when Ongentheow met Eofor there.<BR>
Wide split the war-helm: wan he fell,<BR>
hoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him<BR>
of feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow.<BR>
-- "For all that he[2] gave me, my gleaming sword<BR>
repaid him at war, -- such power I wielded, --<BR>
for lordly treasure: with land he entrusted me,<BR>
homestead and house. He had no need<BR>
from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane folk,<BR>
or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, --<BR>
some warrior worse for wage to buy!<BR>
Ever I fought in the front of all,<BR>
sole to the fore; and so shall I fight<BR>
while I bide in life and this blade shall last<BR>
that early and late hath loyal proved<BR>
since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,<BR>
slain by my hand, the Hugas' champion.<BR>
Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king<BR>
with the booty back, and breast-adornments;<BR>
but, slain in struggle, that standard-bearer<BR>
fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,<BR>
but his bones were broken by brawny gripe,<BR>
his heart-waves stilled. -- The sword-edge now,<BR>
hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall strive."<BR>
Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made<BR>
his last of all: "I have lived through many<BR>
wars in my youth; now once again,<BR>
old folk-defender, feud will I seek,<BR>
do doughty deeds, if the dark destroyer<BR>
forth from his cavern come to fight me!"<BR>
Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all,<BR>
for the last time greeting his liegemen dear,<BR>
comrades of war: "I should carry no weapon,<BR>
no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew<BR>
how, with such enemy, else my vows<BR>
I could gain as I did in Grendel's day.<BR>
But fire in this fight I must fear me now,<BR>
and poisonous breath; so I bring with me<BR>
breastplate and board.[3] From the barrow's keeper<BR>
no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end<BR>
our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,<BR>
all mankind's master. My mood is bold<BR>
but forbears to boast o'er this battling-flyer.<BR>
-- Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed,<BR>
ye heroes in harness, which of us twain<BR>
better from battle-rush bear his wounds.<BR>
Wait ye the finish. The fight is not yours,<BR>
nor meet for any but me alone<BR>
to measure might with this monster here<BR>
and play the hero. Hardily I<BR>
shall win that wealth, or war shall seize,<BR>
cruel killing, your king and lord!"<BR>
Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion,<BR>
stayed by the strength of his single manhood,<BR>
and hardy 'neath helmet his harness bore<BR>
under cleft of the cliffs: no coward's path!<BR>
Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief,<BR>
survivor of many a victory-field<BR>
where foemen fought with furious clashings,<BR>
an arch of stone; and within, a stream<BR>
that broke from the barrow. The brooklet's wave<BR>
was hot with fire. The hoard that way<BR>
he never could hope unharmed to near,<BR>
or endure those deeps,[4] for the dragon's flame.<BR>
Then let from his breast, for he burst with rage,<BR>
the Weder-Geat prince a word outgo;<BR>
stormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing<BR>
and clear his cry 'neath the cliff-rocks gray.<BR>
The hoard-guard heard a human voice;<BR>
his rage was enkindled. No respite now<BR>
for pact of peace! The poison-breath<BR>
of that foul worm first came forth from the cave,<BR>
hot reek-of-fight: the rocks resounded.<BR>
Stout by the stone-way his shield he raised,<BR>
lord of the Geats, against the loathed-one;<BR>
while with courage keen that coiled foe<BR>
came seeking strife. The sturdy king<BR>
had drawn his sword, not dull of edge,<BR>
heirloom old; and each of the two<BR>
felt fear of his foe, though fierce their mood.<BR>
Stoutly stood with his shield high-raised<BR>
the warrior king, as the worm now coiled<BR>
together amain: the mailed-one waited.<BR>
Now, spire by spire, fast sped and glided<BR>
that blazing serpent. The shield protected,<BR>
soul and body a shorter while<BR>
for the hero-king than his heart desired,<BR>
could his will have wielded the welcome respite<BR>
but once in his life! But Wyrd denied it,<BR>
and victory's honors. -- His arm he lifted<BR>
lord of the Geats, the grim foe smote<BR>
with atheling's heirloom. Its edge was turned<BR>
brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly<BR>
than its noble master had need of then<BR>
in his baleful stress. -- Then the barrow's keeper<BR>
waxed full wild for that weighty blow,<BR>
cast deadly flames; wide drove and far<BR>
those vicious fires. No victor's glory<BR>
the Geats' lord boasted; his brand had failed,<BR>
naked in battle, as never it should,<BR>
excellent iron! -- 'Twas no easy path<BR>
that Ecgtheow's honored heir must tread<BR>
over the plain to the place of the foe;<BR>
for against his will he must win a home<BR>
elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving<BR>
this lapsing life! -- Not long it was<BR>
ere those champions grimly closed again.<BR>
The hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved his breast<BR>
once more; and by peril was pressed again,<BR>
enfolded in flames, the folk-commander!<BR>
Nor yet about him his band of comrades,<BR>
sons of athelings, armed stood<BR>
with warlike front: to the woods they bent them,<BR>
their lives to save. But the soul of one<BR>
with care was cumbered. Kinship true<BR>
can never be marred in a noble mind!<BR>

[1] Eofor for Wulf. -- The immediate provocation for Eofor in killing "the
hoary Scylfing," Ongentheow, is that the latter has just struck Wulf down;
but the king, Haethcyn, is also avenged by the blow. See the detailed 
description below.<BR>
[2] Hygelac.<BR>
[3] Shield.<BR>
[4] The hollow passage.<BR>
