# XVIII

A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting  
and winsome words. Of wounden gold,  
she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,  
corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest  
that ever I knew the earth around.  
Ne'er heard I so mighty, 'neath heaven's dome,  
a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore  
to his bright-built burg the Brisings' necklace,  
jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy fled he,  
Eormenric's hate: chose help eternal.  
Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting,  
on the last of his raids this ring bore with him,  
under his banner the booty defending,  
the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o'erwhelmed him  
what time, in his daring, dangers he sought,  
feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems  
he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,  
sovran strong: under shield he died.  
Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,  
gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;  
weaker warriors won the spoil,  
after gripe of battle, from Geatland's lord,  
and held the death-field.  
Din rose in hall.  
Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said:--  
"This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth,  
Beowulf lov'd, these battle-weeds wear,  
a royal treasure, and richly thrive!  
Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here  
counsel in kindness: requital be mine.  
Hast done such deeds, that for days to come  
thou art famed among folk both far and near,  
so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean  
his windy walls. Through the ways of life  
prosper, O prince! I pray for thee  
rich possessions. To son of mine  
be helpful in deed and uphold his joys!  
Here every earl to the other is true,  
mild of mood, to the master loyal!  
Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient,  
liegemen are revelling: list and obey!"  
Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of feasts;  
flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,  
destiny dire, and the doom to be seen  
by many an earl when eve should come,  
and Hrothgar homeward hasten away,  
royal, to rest. The room was guarded  
by an army of earls, as erst was done.  
They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread  
beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser  
in danger of doom lay down in the hall. --  
At their heads they set their shields of war,  
bucklers bright; on the bench were there  
over each atheling, easy to see,  
the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,  
the corselet of rings. 'Twas their custom so  
ever to be for battle prepared,  
at home, or harrying, which it were,  
even as oft as evil threatened  
their sovran king. -- They were clansmen good.
