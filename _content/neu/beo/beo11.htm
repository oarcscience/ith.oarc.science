THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train,<BR>
defence-of-Scyldings, forth from hall;<BR>
fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek,<BR>
couch of his queen. The King-of-Glory<BR>
against this Grendel a guard had set,<BR>
so heroes heard, a hall-defender,<BR>
who warded the monarch and watched for the monster.<BR>
In truth, the Geats' prince gladly trusted<BR>
his mettle, his might, the mercy of God!<BR>
Cast off then his corselet of iron,<BR>
helmet from head; to his henchman gave, --<BR>
choicest of weapons, -- the well-chased sword,<BR>
bidding him guard the gear of battle.<BR>
Spake then his Vaunt the valiant man,<BR>
Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought:--<BR>
"Of force in fight no feebler I count me,<BR>
in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him.<BR>
Not with the sword, then, to sleep of death<BR>
his life will I give, though it lie in my power.<BR>
No skill is his to strike against me,<BR>
my shield to hew though he hardy be,<BR>
bold in battle; we both, this night,<BR>
shall spurn the sword, if he seek me here,<BR>
unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God,<BR>
sacred Lord, on which side soever<BR>
doom decree as he deemeth right."<BR>
Reclined then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held<BR>
the head of the earl, while all about him<BR>
seamen hardy on hall-beds sank.<BR>
None of them thought that thence their steps<BR>
to the folk and fastness that fostered them,<BR>
to the land they loved, would lead them back!<BR>
Full well they wist that on warriors many<BR>
battle-death seized, in the banquet-hall,<BR>
of Danish clan. But comfort and help,<BR>
war-weal weaving, to Weder folk<BR>
the Master gave, that, by might of one,<BR>
over their enemy all prevailed,<BR>
by single strength. In sooth 'tis told<BR>
that highest God o'er human kind<BR>
hath wielded ever! -- Thro' wan night striding,<BR>
came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors slept<BR>
whose hest was to guard the gabled hall, --<BR>
all save one. 'Twas widely known<BR>
that against God's will the ghostly ravager<BR>
him[1] could not hurl to haunts of darkness;<BR>
wakeful, ready, with warrior's wrath,<BR>
bold he bided the battle's issue.<BR>

[1] Beowulf, -- the "one."<BR>
