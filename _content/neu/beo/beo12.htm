<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XI</H1>
THEN from the moorland, by misty crags,<BR>
with God's wrath laden, Grendel came.<BR>
The monster was minded of mankind now<BR>
sundry to seize in the stately house.<BR>
Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there,<BR>
gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,<BR>
flashing with fretwork. Not first time, this,<BR>
that he the home of Hrothgar sought, --<BR>
yet ne'er in his life-day, late or early,<BR>
such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found!<BR>
To the house the warrior walked apace,<BR>
parted from peace;[1] the portal opended,<BR>
though with forged bolts fast, when his fists had struck it,<BR>
and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,<BR>
the house's mouth. All hastily, then,<BR>
o'er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on,<BR>
ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes<BR>
fearful flashes, like flame to see.<BR>
He spied in hall the hero-band,<BR>
kin and clansmen clustered asleep,<BR>
hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart;<BR>
for the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn,<BR>
savage, to sever the soul of each,<BR>
life from body, since lusty banquet<BR>
waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him<BR>
to seize any more of men on earth<BR>
after that evening. Eagerly watched<BR>
Hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe,<BR>
how he would fare in fell attack.<BR>
Not that the monster was minded to pause!<BR>
Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior<BR>
for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,<BR>
the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,<BR>
swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus<BR>
the lifeless corse was clear devoured,<BR>
e'en feet and hands. Then farther he hied;<BR>
for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,<BR>
felt for the foe with fiendish claw,<BR>
for the hero reclining, -- who clutched it boldly,<BR>
prompt to answer, propped on his arm.<BR>
Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils<BR>
that never he met in this middle-world,<BR>
in the ways of earth, another wight<BR>
with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,<BR>
sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!<BR>
Fain would he flee, his fastness seek,<BR>
the den of devils: no doings now<BR>
such as oft he had done in days of old!<BR>
Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane<BR>
of his boast at evening: up he bounded,<BR>
grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked.<BR>
The fiend made off, but the earl close followed.<BR>
The monster meant -- if he might at all --<BR>
to fling himself free, and far away<BR>
fly to the fens, -- knew his fingers' power<BR>
in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march<BR>
to Heorot this monster of harm had made!<BR>
Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft,<BR>
castle-dwellers and clansmen all,<BR>
earls, of their ale. Angry were both<BR>
those savage hall-guards: the house resounded.<BR>
Wonder it was the wine-hall firm<BR>
in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth<BR>
the fair house fell not; too fast it was<BR>
within and without by its iron bands<BR>
craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill<BR>
many a mead-bench -- men have told me --<BR>
gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled.<BR>
So well had weened the wisest Scyldings<BR>
that not ever at all might any man<BR>
that bone-decked, brave house break asunder,<BR>
crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire<BR>
in smoke engulfed it. -- Again uprose<BR>
din redoubled. Danes of the North<BR>
with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,<BR>
who from the wall that wailing heard,<BR>
God's foe sounding his grisly song,<BR>
cry of the conquered, clamorous pain<BR>
from captive of hell. Too closely held him<BR>
he who of men in might was strongest<BR>
in that same day of this our life.<BR>

[1] That is, he was a "lost soul," doomed to hell.<BR>
