# XV

THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now  
for hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng  
of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,  
the guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings  
that were wove on the wall, and wonders many  
to delight each mortal that looks upon them.  
Though braced within by iron bands,  
that building bright was broken sorely;\[1\]  
rent were its hinges; the roof alone  
held safe and sound, when, seared with crime,  
the fiendish foe his flight essayed,  
of life despairing. -- No light thing that,  
the flight for safety, -- essay it who will!  
Forced of fate, he shall find his way  
to the refuge ready for race of man,  
for soul-possessors, and sons of earth;  
and there his body on bed of death  
shall rest after revel.  
Arrived was the hour  
when to hall proceeded Healfdene's son:  
the king himself would sit to banquet.  
Ne'er heard I of host in haughtier throng  
more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings!  
Bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory,  
fain of the feasting. Featly received  
many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit,  
kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall,  
Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now  
was filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings  
ne'er yet had tried the traitor's deed.  
To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene  
a gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,  
broidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet;  
and a splendid sword was seen of many  
borne to the brave one. Beowulf took  
cup in hall:\[2\] for such costly gifts  
he suffered no shame in that soldier throng.  
For I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood,  
with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold,  
on the ale-bench honoring others thus!  
O'er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,  
wound with wires, kept ward o'er the head,  
lest the relict-of-files\[3\] should fierce invade,  
sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero  
should go to grapple against his foes.  
Then the earls'-defence\[4\] on the floor\[5\] bade lead  
coursers eight, with carven head-gear,  
adown the hall: one horse was decked  
with a saddle all shining and set in jewels;  
'twas the battle-seat of the best of kings,  
when to play of swords the son of Healfdene  
was fain to fare. Ne'er failed his valor  
in the crush of combat when corpses fell.  
To Beowulf over them both then gave  
the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,  
o'er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them.  
Manfully thus the mighty prince,  
hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid  
with steeds and treasures contemned by none  
who is willing to say the sooth aright.  
\[1\] There is no horrible inconsistency here such as the critics strive
and cry about. In spite of the ruin that Grendel and Beowulf had made
within the hall, the framework and roof held firm, and swift repairs
made the interior habitable. Tapestries were hung on the walls, and
willing hands prepared the banquet.  
\[2\] From its formal use in other places, this phrase, to take cup in
hall, or "on the floor," would seem to mean that Beowulf stood up to
receive his gifts, drink to the donor, and say thanks.  
\[3\] Kenning for sword.  
\[4\] Hrothgar. He is also the "refuge of the friends of Ing," below.
Ing  
belongs to myth.  
\[5\] Horses are frequently led or ridden into the hall where folk sit
at banquet: so in Chaucer's Squire's tale, in the ballad of King
Estmere, and in the romances.
