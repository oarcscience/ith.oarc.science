<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXXIX</H1>
IT was heavy hap for that hero young<BR>
on his lord beloved to look and find him<BR>
lying on earth with life at end,<BR>
sorrowful sight. But the slayer too,<BR>
awful earth-dragon, empty of breath,<BR>
lay felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure,<BR>
could the writhing monster rule it more.<BR>
For edges of iron had ended its days,<BR>
hard and battle-sharp, hammers' leaving;[1]<BR>
and that flier-afar had fallen to ground<BR>
hushed by its hurt, its hoard all near,<BR>
no longer lusty aloft to whirl<BR>
at midnight, making its merriment seen,<BR>
proud of its prizes: prone it sank<BR>
by the handiwork of the hero-king.<BR>
Forsooth among folk but few achieve,<BR>
-- though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me,<BR>
and never so daring in deed of valor, --<BR>
the perilous breath of a poison-foe<BR>
to brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall,<BR>
whenever his watch the warden keeps<BR>
bold in the barrow. Beowulf paid<BR>
the price of death for that precious hoard;<BR>
and each of the foes had found the end<BR>
of this fleeting life.<BR>
Befell erelong<BR>
that the laggards in war the wood had left,<BR>
trothbreakers, cowards, ten together,<BR>
fearing before to flourish a spear<BR>
in the sore distress of their sovran lord.<BR>
Now in their shame their shields they carried,<BR>
armor of fight, where the old man lay;<BR>
and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat<BR>
at his sovran's shoulder, shieldsman good,<BR>
to wake him with water.[2] Nowise it availed.<BR>
Though well he wished it, in world no more<BR>
could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles<BR>
nor baffle the will of all-wielding God.<BR>
Doom of the Lord was law o'er the deeds<BR>
of every man, as it is to-day.<BR>
Grim was the answer, easy to get,<BR>
from the youth for those that had yielded to fear!<BR>
Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, --<BR>
mournful he looked on those men unloved:--<BR>
"Who sooth will speak, can say indeed<BR>
that the ruler who gave you golden rings<BR>
and the harness of war in which ye stand<BR>
-- for he at ale-bench often-times<BR>
bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate,<BR>
lord to liegemen, the likeliest gear<BR>
which near of far he could find to give, --<BR>
threw away and wasted these weeds of battle,<BR>
on men who failed when the foemen came!<BR>
Not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms<BR>
venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,<BR>
God, gave him grace that he got revenge<BR>
sole with his sword in stress and need.<BR>
To rescue his life, 'twas little that I<BR>
could serve him in struggle; yet shift I made<BR>
(hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman.<BR>
Its strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck<BR>
that fatal foe, and the fire less strongly<BR>
flowed from its head. -- Too few the heroes<BR>
in throe of contest that thronged to our king!<BR>
Now gift of treasure and girding of sword,<BR>
joy of the house and home-delight<BR>
shall fail your folk; his freehold-land<BR>
every clansman within your kin<BR>
shall lose and leave, when lords highborn<BR>
hear afar of that flight of yours,<BR>
a fameless deed. Yea, death is better<BR>
for liegemen all than a life of shame!"<BR>

[1] What had been left or made by the hammer; well-forged.<BR>
[2] Trying to revive him.<BR>
