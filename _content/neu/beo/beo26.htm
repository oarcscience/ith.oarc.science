"UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed<BR>
by sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails<BR>
from foul behest of the hellish fiend.[1]<BR>
Him seems too little what long he possessed.<BR>
Greedy and grim, no golden rings<BR>
he gives for his pride; the promised future<BR>
forgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him,<BR>
Wonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame.<BR>
Yet in the end it ever comes<BR>
that the frame of the body fragile yields,<BR>
fated falls; and there follows another<BR>
who joyously the jewels divides,<BR>
the royal riches, nor recks of his forebear.<BR>
Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest,<BR>
best of men, and the better part choose,<BR>
profit eternal; and temper thy pride,<BR>
warrior famous! The flower of thy might<BR>
lasts now a while: but erelong it shall be<BR>
that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish,<BR>
or fang of fire, or flooding billow,<BR>
or bite of blade, or brandished spear,<BR>
or odious age; or the eyes' clear beam<BR>
wax dull and darken: Death even thee<BR>
in haste shall o'erwhelm, thou hero of war!<BR>
So the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled,<BR>
wielded 'neath welkin, and warded them bravely<BR>
from mighty-ones many o'er middle-earth,<BR>
from spear and sword, till it seemed for me<BR>
no foe could be found under fold of the sky.<BR>
Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure<BR>
came grief for joy when Grendel began<BR>
to harry my home, the hellish foe;<BR>
for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered<BR>
heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked,<BR>
Lord Eternal, for life extended<BR>
that I on this head all hewn and bloody,<BR>
after long evil, with eyes may gaze!<BR>
-- Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,<BR>
warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure<BR>
at dawn of day, be dealt between us!"<BR>
Glad was the Geats' lord, going betimes<BR>
to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded.<BR>
Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,<BR>
for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight<BR>
nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened<BR>
dusk o'er the drinkers.<BR>
The doughty ones rose:<BR>
for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,<BR>
aged Scylding; and eager the Geat,<BR>
shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned.<BR>
Him wander-weary, warrior-guest<BR>
from far, a hall-thane heralded forth,<BR>
who by custom courtly cared for all<BR>
needs of a thane as in those old days<BR>
warrior-wanderers wont to have.<BR>
So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall<BR>
rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on<BR>
till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven[2]<BR>
blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying<BR>
shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,<BR>
athelings all were eager homeward<BR>
forth to fare; and far from thence<BR>
the great-hearted guest would guide his keel.<BR>
Bade then the hardy-one Hrunting be brought<BR>
to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,<BR>
excellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it,<BR>
quoth that he counted it keen in battle,<BR>
"war-friend" winsome: with words he slandered not<BR>
edge of the blade: 'twas a big-hearted man!<BR>
Now eager for parting and armed at point<BR>
warriors waited, while went to his host<BR>
that Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling<BR>
to high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted.<BR>

[1] That is, he is now undefended by conscience from the temptations 
(shafts) of the devil.<BR>
[2] Kenning for the sun. -- This is a strange role for the raven. He is the
warrior's bird of battle, exults in slaughter and carnage; his joy here is a
compliment to the sunrise.<BR>
