HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,<BR>
stood by the steps, the steep roof saw,<BR>
garnished with gold, and Grendel's hand:--<BR>
"For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler<BR>
be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows<BR>
I have borne from Grendel; but God still works<BR>
wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory.<BR>
It was but now that I never more<BR>
for woes that weighed on me waited help<BR>
long as I lived, when, laved in blood,<BR>
stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, --<BR>
widespread woe for wise men all,<BR>
who had no hope to hinder ever<BR>
foes infernal and fiendish sprites<BR>
from havoc in hall. This hero now,<BR>
by the Wielder's might, a work has done<BR>
that not all of us erst could ever do<BR>
by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say<BR>
whoso of women this warrior bore<BR>
among sons of men, if still she liveth,<BR>
that the God of the ages was good to her<BR>
in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,<BR>
of heroes best, I shall heartily love<BR>
as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever<BR>
this kinship new: thou shalt never lack<BR>
wealth of the world that I wield as mine!<BR>
Full oft for less have I largess showered,<BR>
my precious hoard, on a punier man,<BR>
less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now<BR>
fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure<BR>
through all the ages. As ever he did,<BR>
well may the Wielder reward thee still!"<BR>
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>
"This work of war most willingly<BR>
we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared<BR>
force of the foe. Fain, too, were I<BR>
hadst thou but seen himself, what time<BR>
the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!<BR>
Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe<BR>
on his bed of death to bind him down,<BR>
that he in the hent of this hand of mine<BR>
should breathe his last: but he broke away.<BR>
Him I might not -- the Maker willed not --<BR>
hinder from flight, and firm enough hold<BR>
the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he,<BR>
the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,<BR>
he left behind him his hand in pledge,<BR>
arm and shoulder; nor aught of help<BR>
could the cursed one thus procure at all.<BR>
None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,<BR>
sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him<BR>
tightly grasped in gripe of anguish,<BR>
in baleful bonds, where bide he must,<BR>
evil outlaw, such awful doom<BR>
as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out."<BR>
More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf[1]<BR>
in boastful speech of his battle-deeds,<BR>
since athelings all, through the earl's great prowess,<BR>
beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing,<BR>
foeman's fingers, -- the forepart of each<BR>
of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, --<BR>
heathen's "hand-spear," hostile warrior's<BR>
claw uncanny. 'Twas clear, they said,<BR>
that him no blade of the brave could touch,<BR>
how keen soever, or cut away<BR>
that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.<BR>
