HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings:--<BR>
"Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed<BR>
to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere,<BR>
of Yrmenlaf the elder brother,<BR>
my sage adviser and stay in council,<BR>
shoulder-comrade in stress of fight<BR>
when warriors clashed and we warded our heads,<BR>
hewed the helm-boars; hero famed<BR>
should be every earl as Aeschere was!<BR>
But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him<BR>
of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither,[1]<BR>
proud of the prey, her path she took,<BR>
fain of her fill. The feud she avenged<BR>
that yesternight, unyieldingly,<BR>
Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, --<BR>
seeing how long these liegemen mine<BR>
he ruined and ravaged. Reft of life,<BR>
in arms he fell. Now another comes,<BR>
keen and cruel, her kin to avenge,<BR>
faring far in feud of blood:<BR>
so that many a thane shall think, who e'er<BR>
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,<BR>
this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low<BR>
that once was willing each wish to please.<BR>
Land-dwellers here[2] and liegemen mine,<BR>
who house by those parts, I have heard relate<BR>
that such a pair they have sometimes seen,<BR>
march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting,<BR>
wandering spirits: one of them seemed,<BR>
so far as my folk could fairly judge,<BR>
of womankind; and one, accursed,<BR>
in man's guise trod the misery-track<BR>
of exile, though huger than human bulk.<BR>
Grendel in days long gone they named him,<BR>
folk of the land; his father they knew not,<BR>
nor any brood that was born to him<BR>
of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;<BR>
by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,<BR>
fenways fearful, where flows the stream<BR>
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,<BR>
underground flood. Not far is it hence<BR>
in measure of miles that the mere expands,<BR>
and o'er it the frost-bound forest hanging,<BR>
sturdily rooted, shadows the wave.<BR>
By night is a wonder weird to see,<BR>
fire on the waters. So wise lived none<BR>
of the sons of men, to search those depths!<BR>
Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,<BR>
the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,<BR>
long distance driven, his dear life first<BR>
on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge<BR>
to hide his head: 'tis no happy place!<BR>
Thence the welter of waters washes up<BR>
wan to welkin when winds bestir<BR>
evil storms, and air grows dusk,<BR>
and the heavens weep. Now is help once more<BR>
with thee alone! The land thou knowst not,<BR>
place of fear, where thou findest out<BR>
that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare!<BR>
I will reward thee, for waging this fight,<BR>
with ancient treasure, as erst I did,<BR>
with winding gold, if thou winnest back."<BR>

[1] He surmises presently where she is.<BR>
[2] The connection is not difficult. The words of mourning, of acute grief,
are said; and according to Germanic sequence of thought, inexorable here,
the next and only topic is revenge. But is it possible? Hrothgar leads up
to his appeal and promise with a skillful and often effective description of
the horrors which surround the monster's home and await the attempt of
an avenging foe.<BR>
