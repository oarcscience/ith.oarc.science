<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXXVIII</H1>
I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan<BR>
at wish and word of his wounded king, --<BR>
war-sick warrior, -- woven mail-coat,<BR>
battle-sark, bore 'neath the barrow's roof.<BR>
Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud,<BR>
passing the seat,[1] saw store of jewels<BR>
and glistening gold the ground along;<BR>
by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel<BR>
in the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old:<BR>
unburnished bowls of bygone men<BR>
reft of richness; rusty helms<BR>
of the olden age; and arm-rings many<BR>
wondrously woven. -- Such wealth of gold,<BR>
booty from barrow, can burden with pride<BR>
each human wight: let him hide it who will! --<BR>
His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner<BR>
high o'er the hoard, of handiwork noblest,<BR>
brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,<BR>
all the earth-floor he easily saw<BR>
and viewed all these vessels. No vestige now<BR>
was seen of the serpent: the sword had ta'en him.<BR>
Then, I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft,<BR>
old work of giants, by one alone;<BR>
he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate<BR>
at his own good will, and the ensign took,<BR>
brightest of beacons. -- The blade of his lord<BR>
-- its edge was iron -- had injured deep<BR>
one that guarded the golden hoard<BR>
many a year and its murder-fire<BR>
spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows<BR>
at midnight hour, till it met its doom.<BR>
Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him<BR>
his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,<BR>
high-souled hero, if haply he'd find<BR>
alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,<BR>
weakening fast by the wall of the cave.<BR>
So he carried the load. His lord and king<BR>
he found all bleeding, famous chief<BR>
at the lapse of life. The liegeman again<BR>
plashed him with water, till point of word<BR>
broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,<BR>
sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. --<BR>
"For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks,<BR>
to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,<BR>
for what I behold, to Heaven's Lord,<BR>
for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk<BR>
or ever the day of my death be run!<BR>
Now I've bartered here for booty of treasure<BR>
the last of my life, so look ye well<BR>
to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry.<BR>
A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise<BR>
for my ashes. 'Twill shine by the shore of the flood,<BR>
to folk of mine memorial fair<BR>
on Hrones Headland high uplifted,<BR>
that ocean-wanderers oft may hail<BR>
Beowulf's Barrow, as back from far<BR>
they drive their keels o'er the darkling wave."<BR>
From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold,<BR>
valorous king, to his vassal gave it<BR>
with bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring,<BR>
to the youthful thane: bade him use them in joy.<BR>
"Thou art end and remnant of all our race<BR>
the Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,<BR>
all my line, to the land of doom,<BR>
earls in their glory: I after them go."<BR>
This word was the last which the wise old man<BR>
harbored in heart ere hot death-waves<BR>
of balefire he chose. From his bosom fled<BR>
his soul to seek the saints' reward.<BR>

[1] Where Beowulf lay.<BR>
