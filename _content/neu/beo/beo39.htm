THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,<BR>
at the fort on the cliff, where, full of sorrow,<BR>
all the morning earls had sat,<BR>
daring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:<BR>
would they wail as dead, or welcome home,<BR>
their lord beloved? Little[1] kept back<BR>
of the tidings new, but told them all,<BR>
the herald that up the headland rode. --<BR>
"Now the willing-giver to Weder folk<BR>
in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats<BR>
on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent's deed!<BR>
And beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men<BR>
with knife-wounds sick:[2] no sword availed<BR>
on the awesome thing in any wise<BR>
to work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,<BR>
Weohstan's bairn, by Beowulf's side,<BR>
the living earl by the other dead,<BR>
and heavy of heart a head-watch[3] keeps<BR>
o'er friend and foe. -- Now our folk may look<BR>
for waging of war when once unhidden<BR>
to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king<BR>
is spread afar. -- The strife began<BR>
when hot on the Hugas[4] Hygelac fell<BR>
and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.<BR>
Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war,<BR>
plied with such prowess their power o'erwhelming<BR>
that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it<BR>
and fell in fight. To his friends no wise<BR>
could that earl give treasure! And ever since<BR>
the Merowings' favor has failed us wholly.<BR>
Nor aught expect I of peace and faith<BR>
from Swedish folk. 'Twas spread afar<BR>
how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood<BR>
Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,<BR>
when the folk of Geats for the first time sought<BR>
in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.<BR>
Soon the sage old sire[5] of Ohtere,<BR>
ancient and awful, gave answering blow;<BR>
the sea-king[6] he slew, and his spouse redeemed,<BR>
his good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold,<BR>
mother of Ohtere and Onela.<BR>
Then he followed his foes, who fled before him<BR>
sore beset and stole their way,<BR>
bereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood.<BR>
With his host he besieged there what swords had left,<BR>
the weary and wounded; woes he threatened<BR>
the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:<BR>
some with the morrow his sword should kill,<BR>
some should go to the gallows-tree<BR>
for rapture of ravens. But rescue came<BR>
with dawn of day for those desperate men<BR>
when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound,<BR>
tones of his trumpet; the trusty king<BR>
had followed their trail with faithful band.<BR>
