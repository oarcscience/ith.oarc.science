<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXVII</H1>
CAME now to ocean the ever-courageous<BR>
hardy henchmen, their harness bearing,<BR>
woven war-sarks. The warden marked,<BR>
trusty as ever, the earl's return.<BR>
From the height of the hill no hostile words<BR>
reached the guests as he rode to greet them;<BR>
but "Welcome!" he called to that Weder clan<BR>
as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on.<BR>
Then on the strand, with steeds and treasure<BR>
and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship<BR>
was heavily laden: high its mast<BR>
rose over Hrothgar's hoarded gems.<BR>
A sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,<BR>
mounted with gold; on the mead-bench since<BR>
he was better esteemed, that blade possessing,<BR>
heirloom old. -- Their ocean-keel boarding,<BR>
they drove through the deep, and Daneland left.<BR>
A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,<BR>
firm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned;[1]<BR>
nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow<BR>
across from her course. The craft sped on,<BR>
foam-necked it floated forth o'er the waves,<BR>
keel firm-bound over briny currents,<BR>
till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs,<BR>
home-known headlands. High the boat,<BR>
stirred by winds, on the strand updrove.<BR>
Helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood,<BR>
who long already for loved companions<BR>
by the water had waited and watched afar.<BR>
He bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship<BR>
with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows<BR>
that trusty timber should tear away.<BR>
Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure,<BR>
gold and jewels; no journey far<BR>
was it thence to go to the giver of rings,<BR>
Hygelac Hrethling: at home he dwelt<BR>
by the sea-wall close, himself and clan.<BR>
Haughty that house, a hero the king,<BR>
high the hall, and Hygd[2] right young,<BR>
wise and wary, though winters few<BR>
in those fortress walls she had found a home,<BR>
Haereth's daughter. Nor humble her ways,<BR>
nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,<BR>
of precious treasure. Not Thryth's pride showed she,<BR>
folk-queen famed, or that fell deceit.<BR>
Was none so daring that durst make bold<BR>
(save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear<BR>
that lady full in the face to look,<BR>
but forged fetters he found his lot,<BR>
bonds of death! And brief the respite;<BR>
soon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken,<BR>
and the burnished blade a baleful murder<BR>
proclaimed and closed. No queenly way<BR>
for woman to practise, though peerless she,<BR>
that the weaver-of-peace[3] from warrior dear<BR>
by wrath and lying his life should reave!<BR>
But Hemming's kinsman hindered this. --<BR>
For over their ale men also told<BR>
that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,<BR>
onslaughts of evil, after she went,<BR>
gold-decked bride, to the brave young prince,<BR>
atheling haughty, and Offa's hall<BR>
o'er the fallow flood at her father's bidding<BR>
safely sought, where since she prospered,<BR>
royal, throned, rich in goods,<BR>
fain of the fair life fate had sent her,<BR>
and leal in love to the lord of warriors.<BR>
He, of all heroes I heard of ever<BR>
from sea to sea, of the sons of earth,<BR>
most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised<BR>
for his fighting and feeing by far-off men,<BR>
the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled<BR>
over his empire. Eomer woke to him,<BR>
help of heroes, Hemming's kinsman,<BR>
Grandson of Garmund, grim in war.<BR>

[1] With the speed of the boat.<BR>
[2] Queen to Hygelac. She is praised by contrast with the antitype, Thryth,
just as Beowulf was praised by contrast with Heremod.<BR>
[3] Kenning for "wife."<BR>
