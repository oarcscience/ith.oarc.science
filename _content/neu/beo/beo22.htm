<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXI</H1>
BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:<BR>
"Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better<BR>
friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.<BR>
Each of us all must his end abide<BR>
in the ways of the world; so win who may<BR>
glory ere death! When his days are told,<BR>
that is the warrior's worthiest doom.<BR>
Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,<BR>
and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.<BR>
No harbor shall hide her -- heed my promise! --<BR>
enfolding of field or forested mountain<BR>
or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!<BR>
But thou this day endure in patience,<BR>
as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one."<BR>
Leaped up the graybeard: God he thanked,<BR>
mighty Lord, for the man's brave words.<BR>
For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled<BR>
wave-maned steed. The sovran wise<BR>
stately rode on; his shield-armed men<BR>
followed in force. The footprints led<BR>
along the woodland, widely seen,<BR>
a path o'er the plain, where she passed, and trod<BR>
the murky moor; of men-at-arms<BR>
she bore the bravest and best one, dead,<BR>
him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.<BR>
On then went the atheling-born<BR>
o'er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,<BR>
narrow passes and unknown ways,<BR>
headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.<BR>
Foremost he[1] fared, a few at his side<BR>
of the wiser men, the ways to scan,<BR>
till he found in a flash the forested hill<BR>
hanging over the hoary rock,<BR>
a woful wood: the waves below<BR>
were dyed in blood. The Danish men<BR>
had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,<BR>
for many a hero, 'twas hard to bear,<BR>
ill for earls, when Aeschere's head<BR>
they found by the flood on the foreland there.<BR>
Waves were welling, the warriors saw,<BR>
hot with blood; but the horn sang oft<BR>
battle-song bold. The band sat down,<BR>
and watched on the water worm-like things,<BR>
sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,<BR>
and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness --<BR>
such as oft essay at hour of morn<BR>
on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, --<BR>
and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,<BR>
swollen and savage that song to hear,<BR>
that war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats,<BR>
with bolt from bow, then balked of life,<BR>
of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart<BR>
went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed<BR>
less doughty in swimming whom death had seized.<BR>
Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well<BR>
hooked and barbed, it was hard beset,<BR>
done to death and dragged on the headland,<BR>
wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed the grisly guest.<BR>
Then girt him Beowulf<BR>
in martial mail, nor mourned for his life.<BR>
His breastplate broad and bright of hues,<BR>
woven by hand, should the waters try;<BR>
well could it ward the warrior's body<BR>
that battle should break on his breast in vain<BR>
nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe.<BR>
And the helmet white that his head protected<BR>
was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,<BR>
through wave-whirl win: 'twas wound with chains,<BR>
decked with gold, as in days of yore<BR>
the weapon-smith worked it wondrously,<BR>
with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,<BR>
brandished in battle, could bite that helm.<BR>
Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps<BR>
which Hrothgar's orator offered at need:<BR>
"Hrunting" they named the hilted sword,<BR>
of old-time heirlooms easily first;<BR>
iron was its edge, all etched with poison,<BR>
with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight<BR>
in hero's hand who held it ever,<BR>
on paths of peril prepared to go<BR>
to folkstead[2] of foes. Not first time this<BR>
it was destined to do a daring task.<BR>
For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf<BR>
sturdy and strong, that speech he had made,<BR>
drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent<BR>
to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not<BR>
under welter of waters wager his life<BR>
as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory,<BR>
honor of earls. With the other not so,<BR>
who girded him now for the grim encounter.<BR>

[1] Hrothgar is probably meant.<BR>
[2] Meeting place.<BR>
