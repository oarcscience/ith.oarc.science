# XL

THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,  
at the fort on the cliff, where, full of sorrow,  
all the morning earls had sat,  
daring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:  
would they wail as dead, or welcome home,  
their lord beloved? Little\[1\] kept back  
of the tidings new, but told them all,  
the herald that up the headland rode. --  
"Now the willing-giver to Weder folk  
in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats  
on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent's deed!  
And beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men  
with knife-wounds sick:\[2\] no sword availed  
on the awesome thing in any wise  
to work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,  
Weohstan's bairn, by Beowulf's side,  
the living earl by the other dead,  
and heavy of heart a head-watch\[3\] keeps  
o'er friend and foe. -- Now our folk may look  
for waging of war when once unhidden  
to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king  
is spread afar. -- The strife began  
when hot on the Hugas\[4\] Hygelac fell  
and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.  
Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war,  
plied with such prowess their power o'erwhelming  
that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it  
and fell in fight. To his friends no wise  
could that earl give treasure! And ever since  
the Merowings' favor has failed us wholly.  
Nor aught expect I of peace and faith  
from Swedish folk. 'Twas spread afar  
how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood  
Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,  
when the folk of Geats for the first time sought  
in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.  
Soon the sage old sire\[5\] of Ohtere,  
ancient and awful, gave answering blow;  
the sea-king\[6\] he slew, and his spouse redeemed,  
his good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold,  
mother of Ohtere and Onela.  
Then he followed his foes, who fled before him  
sore beset and stole their way,  
bereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood.  
With his host he besieged there what swords had left,  
the weary and wounded; woes he threatened  
the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:  
some with the morrow his sword should kill,  
some should go to the gallows-tree  
for rapture of ravens. But rescue came  
with dawn of day for those desperate men  
when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound,  
tones of his trumpet; the trusty king  
had followed their trail with faithful band.  
\[1\] Nothing.  
\[2\] Dead.  
\[3\] Death-watch, guard of honor, "lyke-wake."  
\[4\] A name for the Franks.  
\[5\] Ongentheow.  
\[6\] Haethcyn.
