BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>
"Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene<BR>
gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,<BR>
sovran wise, what once was said:<BR>
if in thy cause it came that I<BR>
should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide<BR>
to me, though fallen, in father's place!<BR>
Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,<BR>
my warrior-friends, if War should seize me;<BR>
and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,<BR>
Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send!<BR>
Geatland's king may ken by the gold,<BR>
Hrethel's son see, when he stares at the treasure,<BR>
that I got me a friend for goodness famed,<BR>
and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.<BR>
And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword,<BR>
earl far-honored, this heirloom precious,<BR>
hard of edge: with Hrunting I<BR>
seek doom of glory, or Death shall take me."<BR>
After these words the Weder-Geat lord<BR>
boldly hastened, biding never<BR>
answer at all: the ocean floods<BR>
closed o'er the hero. Long while of the day<BR>
fled ere he felt the floor of the sea.<BR>
Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain<BR>
sword-hungry held these hundred winters,<BR>
greedy and grim, that some guest from above,<BR>
some man, was raiding her monster-realm.<BR>
She grasped out for him with grisly claws,<BR>
and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not<BR>
his body hale; the breastplate hindered,<BR>
as she strove to shatter the sark of war,<BR>
the linked harness, with loathsome hand.<BR>
Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,<BR>
the lord of rings to the lair she haunted<BR>
whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held,<BR>
weapon to wield against wondrous monsters<BR>
that sore beset him; sea-beasts many<BR>
tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,<BR>
and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked<BR>
he was now in some hall, he knew not which,<BR>
where water never could work him harm,<BR>
nor through the roof could reach him ever<BR>
fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw,<BR>
beams of a blaze that brightly shone.<BR>
Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,<BR>
mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke<BR>
he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not.<BR>
Then sang on her head that seemly blade<BR>
its war-song wild. But the warrior found<BR>
the light-of-battle[1] was loath to bite,<BR>
to harm the heart: its hard edge failed<BR>
the noble at need, yet had known of old<BR>
strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven,<BR>
doomed men's fighting-gear. First time, this,<BR>
for the gleaming blade that its glory fell.<BR>
Firm still stood, nor failed in valor,<BR>
heedful of high deeds, Hygelac's kinsman;<BR>
flung away fretted sword, featly jewelled,<BR>
the angry earl; on earth it lay<BR>
steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted,<BR>
hand-gripe of might. So man shall do<BR>
whenever in war he weens to earn him<BR>
lasting fame, nor fears for his life!<BR>
Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat,<BR>
the Geatish war-prince Grendel's mother.<BR>
Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,<BR>
his deadly foe, that she fell to ground.<BR>
Swift on her part she paid him back<BR>
with grisly grasp, and grappled with him.<BR>
Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,<BR>
fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown.<BR>
On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword,<BR>
broad and brown-edged,[2] the bairn to avenge,<BR>
the sole-born son. -- On his shoulder lay<BR>
braided breast-mail, barring death,<BR>
withstanding entrance of edge or blade.<BR>
Life would have ended for Ecgtheow's son,<BR>
under wide earth for that earl of Geats,<BR>
had his armor of war not aided him,<BR>
battle-net hard, and holy God<BR>
wielded the victory, wisest Maker.<BR>
The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;<BR>
and easily rose the earl erect.<BR>

[1] Kenning for "sword." Hrunting is bewitched, laid under a spell of
uselessness, along with all other swords.<BR>
[2] This brown of swords, evidently meaning burnished, bright, continues to
be a favorite adjective in the popular ballads.<BR>
