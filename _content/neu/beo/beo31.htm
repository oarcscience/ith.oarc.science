<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXXII</H1>
THAT way he went with no will of his own,<BR>
in danger of life, to the dragon's hoard,<BR>
but for pressure of peril, some prince's thane.<BR>
He fled in fear the fatal scourge,<BR>
seeking shelter, a sinful man,<BR>
and entered in. At the awful sight<BR>
tottered that guest, and terror seized him;<BR>
yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon<BR>
from fright and fear ere he fled away,<BR>
and took the cup from that treasure-hoard.<BR>
Of such besides there was store enough,<BR>
heirlooms old, the earth below,<BR>
which some earl forgotten, in ancient years,<BR>
left the last of his lofty race,<BR>
heedfully there had hidden away,<BR>
dearest treasure. For death of yore<BR>
had hurried all hence; and he alone<BR>
left to live, the last of the clan,<BR>
weeping his friends, yet wished to bide<BR>
warding the treasure, his one delight,<BR>
though brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready,<BR>
to strand and sea-waves stood anear,<BR>
hard by the headland, hidden and closed;<BR>
there laid within it his lordly heirlooms<BR>
and heaped hoard of heavy gold<BR>
that warden of rings. Few words he spake:<BR>
"Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not,<BR>
what earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee<BR>
brave men brought it! But battle-death seized<BR>
and cruel killing my clansmen all,<BR>
robbed them of life and a liegeman's joys.<BR>
None have I left to lift the sword,<BR>
or to cleanse the carven cup of price,<BR>
beaker bright. My brave are gone.<BR>
And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,<BR>
shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep<BR>
who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;<BR>
and those weeds of war that were wont to brave<BR>
over bicker of shields the bite of steel<BR>
rust with their bearer. The ringed mail<BR>
fares not far with famous chieftain,<BR>
at side of hero! No harp's delight,<BR>
no glee-wood's gladness! No good hawk now<BR>
flies through the hall! Nor horses fleet<BR>
stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death<BR>
the flower of my race have reft away."<BR>
Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,<BR>
alone, for them all, and unblithe wept<BR>
by day and by night, till death's fell wave<BR>
o'erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss<BR>
that old ill-doer open found,<BR>
who, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,<BR>
naked foe-dragon flying by night<BR>
folded in fire: the folk of earth<BR>
dread him sore. 'Tis his doom to seek<BR>
hoard in the graves, and heathen gold<BR>
to watch, many-wintered: nor wins he thereby!<BR>
Powerful this plague-of-the-people thus<BR>
held the house of the hoard in earth<BR>
three hundred winters; till One aroused<BR>
wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing<BR>
that costly cup, and the king implored<BR>
for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,<BR>
borne off was booty. His boon was granted<BR>
that wretched man; and his ruler saw<BR>
first time what was fashioned in far-off days.<BR>
When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.<BR>
O'er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found<BR>
footprint of foe who so far had gone<BR>
in his hidden craft by the creature's head. --<BR>
So may the undoomed easily flee<BR>
evils and exile, if only he gain<BR>
the grace of The Wielder! -- That warden of gold<BR>
o'er the ground went seeking, greedy to find<BR>
the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.<BR>
Savage and burning, the barrow he circled<BR>
all without; nor was any there,<BR>
none in the waste.... Yet war he desired,<BR>
was eager for battle. The barrow he entered,<BR>
sought the cup, and discovered soon<BR>
that some one of mortals had searched his treasure,<BR>
his lordly gold. The guardian waited<BR>
ill-enduring till evening came;<BR>
boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper,<BR>
and fain with flame the foe to pay<BR>
for the dear cup's loss. -- Now day was fled<BR>
as the worm had wished. By its wall no more<BR>
was it glad to bide, but burning flew<BR>
folded in flame: a fearful beginning<BR>
for sons of the soil; and soon it came,<BR>
in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end.<BR>
