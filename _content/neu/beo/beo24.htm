<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXIII</H1>
'MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,<BR>
old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,<BR>
warriors' heirloom, weapon unmatched,<BR>
-- save only 'twas more than other men<BR>
to bandy-of-battle could bear at all --<BR>
as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen.<BR>
Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings' chieftain,<BR>
bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,<BR>
reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote<BR>
that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,<BR>
her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through<BR>
that fated-one's flesh: to floor she sank.<BR>
Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed.<BR>
Then blazed forth light. 'Twas bright within<BR>
as when from the sky there shines unclouded<BR>
heaven's candle. The hall he scanned.<BR>
By the wall then went he; his weapon raised<BR>
high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane,<BR>
angry and eager. That edge was not useless<BR>
to the warrior now. He wished with speed<BR>
Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many,<BR>
for the war he waged on Western-Danes<BR>
oftener far than an only time,<BR>
when of Hrothgar's hearth-companions<BR>
he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,<BR>
fifteen men of the folk of Danes,<BR>
and as many others outward bore,<BR>
his horrible prey. Well paid for that<BR>
the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw<BR>
Grendel stretched there, spent with war,<BR>
spoiled of life, so scathed had left him<BR>
Heorot's battle. The body sprang far<BR>
when after death it endured the blow,<BR>
sword-stroke savage, that severed its head.<BR>
Soon,[1] then, saw the sage companions<BR>
who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood,<BR>
that the tossing waters turbid grew,<BR>
blood-stained the mere. Old men together,<BR>
hoary-haired, of the hero spake;<BR>
the warrior would not, they weened, again,<BR>
proud of conquest, come to seek<BR>
their mighty master. To many it seemed<BR>
the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life.<BR>
The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings<BR>
left the headland; homeward went<BR>
the gold-friend of men.[2] But the guests sat on,<BR>
stared at the surges, sick in heart,<BR>
and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord again to see.<BR>
Now that sword began,<BR>
from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,[3]<BR>
war-blade, to wane: 'twas a wondrous thing<BR>
that all of it melted as ice is wont<BR>
when frosty fetters the Father loosens,<BR>
unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all<BR>
seasons and times: the true God he!<BR>
Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats<BR>
precious things, though a plenty he saw,<BR>
save only the head and that hilt withal<BR>
blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted,<BR>
burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,<BR>
so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there.<BR>
Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat<BR>
downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.<BR>
The clashing waters were cleansed now,<BR>
waste of waves, where the wandering fiend<BR>
her life-days left and this lapsing world.<BR>
Swam then to strand the sailors'-refuge,<BR>
sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,<BR>
of burden brave he bore with him.<BR>
Went then to greet him, and God they thanked,<BR>
the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,<BR>
that safe and sound they could see him again.<BR>
Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor<BR>
deftly they doffed: now drowsed the mere,<BR>
water 'neath welkin, with war-blood stained.<BR>
Forth they fared by the footpaths thence,<BR>
merry at heart the highways measured,<BR>
well-known roads. Courageous men<BR>
carried the head from the cliff by the sea,<BR>
an arduous task for all the band,<BR>
the firm in fight, since four were needed<BR>
on the shaft-of-slaughter[4] strenuously<BR>
to bear to the gold-hall Grendel's head.<BR>
So presently to the palace there<BR>
foemen fearless, fourteen Geats,<BR>
marching came. Their master-of-clan<BR>
mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.<BR>
Strode then within the sovran thane<BR>
fearless in fight, of fame renowned,<BR>
hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet.<BR>
And next by the hair into hall was borne<BR>
Grendel's head, where the henchmen were drinking,<BR>
an awe to clan and queen alike,<BR>
a monster of marvel: the men looked on.<BR>

[1] After the killing of the monster and Grendel's decapitation.<BR>
[2] Hrothgar.<BR>
[3] The blade slowly dissolves in blood-stained drops like icicles. <BR>
[4] Spear.<BR>
