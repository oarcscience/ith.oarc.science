### Chapter LXXII: Bolli and Thorleik go abroad, A.D. 1027

After the peace between Bolli and Thorleik and the sons of Olaf had been
settled and Thorleik had been one winter in Iceland, Bolli made it known
that he was minded to go abroad. Snorri, dissuading him, said, "To us it
seems there is a great risk to be run as to how you may speed; but if
you wish to have in hand more than you have now, I will get you a manor
and stock it for you; therewithal I shall hand over to you chieftainship
over men and uphold you for honours in all things; and that, I know,
will be easy, seeing that most men bear you goodwill."

Bolli said, "I have long had it in my mind to go for once into southern
lands; for a man is deemed to grow benighted if he learns to know
nothing farther afield than what is to be seen here in Iceland."

And when Snorri saw that Bolli had set his mind on this, and that it
would come to nought to try to stop him, he bade him take as much money
as he liked for his journey. Bolli was all for having plenty of money,
"for I will not," he said, "be beholden to any man either here or in any
foreign land."

Then Bolli rode south to Burgfirth to White-river and bought half of a
ship from the owners, so that he and his brother became joint owners of
the same ship. Bolli then rides west again to his home. He and Thordis
had one daughter whose name was Herdis, and that maiden Gudrun asked to
bring up. She was one year old when she went to Holyfell. Thordis also
spent a great deal of her time there, for Gudrun was very fond of her.
