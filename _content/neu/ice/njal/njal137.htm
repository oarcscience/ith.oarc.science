<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">137. OF EYJOLF BOLVERK'S SON</H1>
<P>There was a man named Eyjolf. He was the son of Bolverk, the son of Eyjolf the Guileful, of Otterdale (1). Eyjolf was a man of great rank, and best skilled in law of all men, so that some said he was the third best lawyer in Iceland. He was the fairest in face of all men, tall and strong, and there was the making of a great chief in him. He was greedy of money, like the rest of his kinsfolk.</P>
<P>One day Flosi went to the booth of Bjarni Broddhelgi's son. Bjarni took him by both hands, and sat Flosi down by his side. They talked about many things, and at last Flosi said to Bjarni, "What counsel shall we now take?"</P>
<P>"I think," answered Bjarni, "that it is now hard to say what to do, but the wisest thing seems to me to go round and ask for help, since they are drawing strength together against you. I will also ask thee, Flosi, whether there be any very good lawyer in your band; for now there are but two courses left; one to ask if they will take an atonement, and that is not a bad choice, but the other is to defend the suit at law, if there be any defence to it, though that will seem to be a bold course; and this is why I think this last ought to be chosen, because ye have hitherto fared high and mightily, and it is unseemly now to take a lower course."</P>
<P>"As to thy asking about lawyers said Flosi, "I will answer thee at once that there is no such man in our band; nor do I know where to look for one except it be Thorkel Geitir's son, thy kinsman."</P>
<P>"We must not reckon on him," said Bjarni, "for though he knows something of law, he is far too wary, and no man need hope to have him as his shield; but he will back thee as well as any man who backs thee best, for he has a stout heart; besides, I must tell thee that it will be that man's bane who undertakes the defence in this suit for the burning, but I have no mind that this should befall my kinsmen Thorkel, so ye must turn your eyes elsewhither."</P>
<P>Flosi said he knew nothing about who were the best lawyers.</P>
<P>"There is a man named Eyjolf," said Bjarni; "he is Bolverk's son, and he is the best lawyer in the Westfirther's Quarter; but you will need to give him much money if you are to bring him into the suit, but still we must not stop at that. We must also go with our arms to all law business, and be most wary of ourselves, but not meddle with them before we are forced to fight for our lives. And now I will go with thee, and set out at once on our begging for help, for now methinks the peace will be kept but a little while longer."</P>
<P>After that they go out of the booth, and to the booths of the Axefirthers. Then Bjarni talks with Lyting and Bleing, and Hroi Arnstein's son, and he got speedily whatever he asked of them. Then they fared to see Kol, the son of Killing-Skuti, and Eyvind Thorkel's son, the son of Askel the Priest, and asked them for their help; but they stood out a long while, but the end of it was that they took three marks of silver for it, and so went into the suit with them.</P>
<P>Then they went to the booths of the men of Lightwater, and stayed there some time. Flosi begged the men of Lightwater for help, but they were stubborn and hard to win over, and then Flosi said, with much wrath, "Ye are ill-behaved! Ye are grasping and wrongful at home in your own country, and ye will not help men at the Thing, though they need it. No doubt you will be held up to reproach at the Thing, and very great blame will be laid on you if ye bear not in mind that scorn and those biting words which Skarphedinn hurled at you men of Lightwater."</P>
<P>But on the other hand, Flosi dealt secretly with them, and bade them money for their help, and so coaxed them over with fair words, until it came about that they promised him their aid, and then became so steadfast that they said they would fight for Flosi, if need were.</P>
<P>Then Bjarni said to Flosi, "Well done! Well done! Thou art a mighty chief, and a bold outspoken man, and reckest little what thou savest to men."</P>
<P>After that they fared away west across the river, and so to the Hladbooth. They saw many men outside before the booth. There was one man who had a scarlet cloak over his shoulders, and a gold band round his head, and an axe studded with silver in his hand.</P>
<P>"This is just right," said Bjarni, "here now is the man I spoke of, Eyjolf Bolverk's son, if thou wilt see him, Flosi."</P>
<P>Then they went to meet Eyjolf, and hailed him. Eyjolf knew Bjarni at once, and greeted him well. Bjarni took Eyjolf by the hand, and led him up into the "Great Rift." Flosi's and Bjarni's men followed after, and Eyjolf's men went also with him. They bade them stay upon the lower brink of the Rift, and look about them, but Flosi, and Bjarni, and Eyjolf went on till they came to where the path leads down from the upper brink of the Rift.</P>
<P>Flosi said it was a good spot to sit down there, for they could see around them far and wide. Then they sat them down there. They were four of them together, and no more.</P>
<P>Then Bjarni spoke to Eyjolf, and said "Thee, friend, have we come to see, for we much need thy help in every way."</P>
<P>"Now," said Eyjolf, "there is good choice of men here at the Thing, and ye will not find it hard to fall on those who will be a much greater strength to you than I can be."</P>
<P>"Not so," said Bjarni, "thou hast many things which show that there is no greater man than thou at the Thing; first of all, that thou art so well-born, as all those men are who are sprung from Ragnar Hairybreeks; thy forefathers, too, have always stood first in great suits, both here at the Thing and at home in their own country, and they have always had the best of it; we think, therefore, it is likely that thou wilt be lucky in winning suits, like thy kinsfolk."</P>
<P>"Thou speakest well, Bjarni," said Evjolf; "but I think that I have small share in all this that thou savest."</P>
<P>Then Flosi said, "There is no need beating about the bush as to what we have in mind. We wish to ask for thy help, Eyjolf, and that thou wilt stand by us in our suits, and go to the court with us, and undertake the defence, if there be any, and plead it for us, and stand by us in all things that may happen at this Thing."</P>
<P>Eyjolf jumped up in wrath, and said that no man had any right to think that he could make a catspaw of him, or drag him on if he had no mind to go himself.</P>
<P>"I see, too, now," he says, "what has led you to utter all those fair words with which ye began to speak to me."</P>
<P>Then Hallbjorn the Strong caught hold of him and sate him down by his side, between him and Bjarni, and said, "No tree falls at the first stroke, friend, but sit here awhile by us." Then Flosi drew a gold ring off his arm.</P>
<P>"This ring will I give thee, Eyjolf, for thy help and friendship, and so show thee that I will not befool thee. It will be best for thee to take the ring, for there is no man here at the Thing to whom I have ever given such a gift."</P>
<P>The ring was such a good one, and so well made, that it was worth twelve hundred yards of russet stuff.</P>
<P>Hallbjorn drew the ring on Eyjolf's arm; and Eyjolf said, "It is now most fitting that I should take the ring, since thou behavest so handsomely; and now thou mayest make up thy mind that I will undertake the defence, and do all things needful."</P>
<P>"Now," said Bjarni, "ye behave handsomely on both sides, and here are men well fitted to be witnesses, since I and Hallbjorn are here, that thou hast undertaken the suit."</P>
<P>Then Eyjolf arose, and Flosi too, and they took one another by the hand; and so Eyjolf undertook the whole defence of the suit off Flosi's hands, and so, too, if any suit arose out of the defence, for it often happens that what is a defence in one suit, is a plaintiff's plea in another. So he took upon him all the proofs and proceedings which belonged to those suits, whether they were to be pleaded before the Quarter Court or the Fifth Court. Flosi handed them over in lawful form, and Eyjolf took them in lawful form, and then he said to Flosi and Bjarni, "Now I have undertaken this defence just as ye asked, but my wish it is that ye should still keep it secret at first; but if the matter comes into the Fifth Court, then be most careful not to say that ye have given goods for my help."</P>
<P>Then Flosi went home to his booth, and Bjarni with him, but Eyjolf went to the booth of Snorri the Priest, and sate down by him, and they talked much together.</P>
<P>Snorri the Priest caught hold of Eyjolf's arm, and turned up the sleeve, and sees that he had a great ring of gold on his arm. Then Snorri the Priest said, "Pray, was this ring bought or given?"</P>
<P>Eyjolf was put out about it, and had never a word to say. Then Snorri said, "I see plainly that thou must have taken it as a gift, and may this ring not be thy death!"</P>
<P>Eyjolf jumped up and went away, and would not speak about it; and Snorri said, as Eyjolf arose, "It is very likely that thou wilt know what kind of gift thou hast taken by the time this Thing is ended."</P>
<P>Then Eyjolf went to his booth.</P>
<P>ENDNOTES:</P>
<P>(1) Eyjolf the Guileful was the son of Thord Gellir, the son of Oleif Feilan. The mother of Eyjolf the Guileful was Rodny, the daughter of Skeggi of Midfirth.</P>
