# 58. HOW GUNNAR'S HORSE FOUGHT

Just then Gunnar heard of the death of his father-in-law Hauskuld; a few
nights after, Thorgerda, Thrain's wife, was delivered at Gritwater, and
gave birth to a boy child. Then she sent a man to her mother, and bade
her choose whether it should be called Glum or Hauskuld. She bade call
it Hauskuld. So that name was given to the boy.

Gunnar and Hallgerda had two sons, the one's name was Hogni and the
other's Grani. Hogni was a brave man of few words, distrustful and slow
to believe, but truthful.

Now men ride to the horse-fight, and a very great crowd is gathered
together there. Gunnar was there and his brothers, and the sons of
Sigfus. Njal and all his sons. There too was come Starkad and his sons,
and Egil and his sons, and they said to Gunnar that now they would lead
the horses together.

Gunnar said, "That was well."

Skarphedinn said, "Wilt thou that I drive thy horse, kinsman Gunnar?"

"I will not have that," says Gunnar.

"It wouldn't be amiss though," says Skarphedinn; "we are hot- headed on
both sides."

"Ye would say or do little," says Gunnar, "before a quarrel would spring
up; but with me it will take longer, though it will be all the same in
the end."

After that the horses were led together; Gunnar busked him to drive his
horse, but Skarphedinn led him out. Gunnar was in a red kirtle, and had
about his loins a broad belt, and a great riding-rod in his hand.

Then the horses ran at one another, and bit each other long, so that
there was no need for any one to touch them, and that was the greatest
sport.

Then Thorgeir and Kol made up their minds that they would push their
horse forward just as the horses rushed together, and see if Gunnar
would fall before him.

Now the horses ran at one another again, and both Thorgeir and Kol ran
alongside their horses' flank.

Gunnar pushes his horse against them, and what happened in a trice was
this, that Thorgeir and his brother fall down flat on their backs, and
their horse a-top of them.

Then they spring up and rush at Gunnar. Gunnar swings himself free and
seizes Kol, casts him down on the field, so that he lies senseless.
Thorgeir Starkad's son smote Gunnar's horse such a blow that one of his
eyes started out. Gunnar smote Thorgeir with his riding-rod, and down
falls Thorgeir senseless; but Gunnar goes to his horse, and said to
Kolskegg, "Cut off the horse's head; he shall not live a maimed and
blemished beast."

So Kolskegg cut the head off the horse.

Then Thorgeir got on his feet and took his weapons, and wanted to fly at
Gunnar, but that was stopped, and there was a great throng and crush.

Skarphedinn said, "This crowd wearies me, and it is far more manly that
men should fight it out with weapons; and so he sang a song:

"At the Thing there is a throng;  
Past all bounds the crowding comes;  
Hard 'twill be to patch up peace  
'Twixt the men. This wearies me;  
Worthier is it far for men  
Weapons red with gore to stain;  
I for one would sooner tame  
Hunger huge of cub of wolf."

Gunnar was still, so that one man held him, and spoke no ill words.

Njal tried to bring about a settlement, or to get pledges of peace; but
Thorgeir said he would neither give nor take peace; far rather, he said,
would he see Gunnar dead for the blow.

Kolskegg said, "Gunnar has before now stood too fast, than that he
should have fallen for words alone, and so it will be again."

Now men ride away from the horse-field, every one to his home. They make
no attack on Gunnar, and so that halfyear passed away. At the Thing, the
summer after, Gunnar met Olaf the peacock, his cousin, and he asked him
to come and see him, but yet bade him be ware of himself; "For," says
he, "they will do us all the harm they can, and mind and fare always
with many men at thy back."

He gave him much good counsel beside, and they agreed that there should
be the greatest friendship between them.
