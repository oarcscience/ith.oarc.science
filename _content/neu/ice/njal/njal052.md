# 52. OF RUNOLF, THE SON OF WOLF AURPRIEST

There was a man named Runolf, the son of Wolf Aurpriest, he kept house
at the Dale, east of Markfleet. He was Otkell's guest once when he rode
from the Thing. Otkell gave him an ox, all black, without a spot of
white, nine winters old. Runolf thanked him for the gift, and bade him
come and see him at home whenever he chose to go; and this bidding stood
over for some while, so that he had not paid the visit. Runolf often
sent men to him and put him in mind that he ought to come; and he always
said he would come, but never went.

Now Otkell had two horses, dun coloured, with a black stripe down the
back; they were the best steeds to ride in all the country round, and so
fond of each other that whenever one went before the other ran after
him.

There was an Easterling staying with Otkell, whose name was Audulf; he
had set his heart on Signy, Otkell's daughter. Audulf was a tall man in
growth, and strong.
