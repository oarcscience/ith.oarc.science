# 4. OF HRUT'S CRUISE

When the spring came he asked about Soti, and found out he had gone
south to Denmark with the inheritance. Then Hrut went to Gunnhillda and
tells her what Soti had been about. Gunnhillda said, "I will give thee
two long-ships, full manned, and along with them the bravest man, Wolf
the Unwashed, our overseer of guests; but still go and see the king
before thou settest off."

Hrut did so; and when he came before the king, then he told the king of
Soti's doings, and how he had a mind to hold on after him.

The king said, "What strength has my mother handed over to thee?"

"Two long-ships and Wolf the Unwashed to lead the men," says Hrut.

"Well given," says the king. " Now I will give thee other two ships, and
even then thou'lt need all the strength thou'st got."

After that he went down with Hrut to the ship, and said, "fare thee
well." Then Hrut sailed away south with his crews.
