<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">55. NJAL'S ADVICE TO GUNNAR</H1>
<P>Now those tidings are heard far and wide, and many said that they thought they had not happened before it was likely. Gunnar rode to Bergthorsknoll and told Njal of these deeds.</P>
<P>Njal said, "Thou hast done great things, but thou hast been sorely tried."</P>
<P>"How will it now go henceforth?" says Gunnar.</P>
<P>"Wilt thou that I tell thee what hath not yet come to pass?" asks Njal. "Thou wilt ride to the Thing, and thou wilt abide by my counsel and get the greatest honour from this matter. This will be the beginning of thy manslayings."</P>
<P>"But give me some cunning counsel," says Gunnar.</P>
<P>"I will do that," says Njal, "never slay more than one man in the same stock, and never break the peace which good men and true make between thee and others, and least of all in such a matter as this."</P>
<P>Gunnar said, "I should have thought there was more risk of that with others than with me."</P>
<P>"Like enough," says Njal, "but still thou shalt so think of thy quarrels, that if that should come to pass of which I have warned thee, then thou wilt have but a little while to live; but otherwise, thou wilt come to be an old man."</P>
<P>Gunnar said, "Dost thou know what will be thine own death?"</P>
<P>"I know it," says Njal.</P>
<P>"What?" asks Gunnar.</P>
<P>"That," says Njal, "which all would be the last to think."</P>
<P>After that Gunnar rode home.</P>
<P>A man was sent to Gizur the White and Geir the Priest, for they had the blood-feud after Otkell. Then they had a meeting, and had a talk about what was to be done; and they were of one mind that the quarrel should be followed up at law. Then some one was sought who would take the suit up, but no one was ready to do that.</P>
<P>"It seems to me," says Gizur, "that now there are only two courses, that one of us two undertakes the suit, and then we shall have to draw lots who it shall be, or else the man will be unatoned. We may make up our minds, too, that this will be a heavy suit to touch; Gunnar has many kinsmen and is much beloved; but that one of us who does not draw the lot, shall ride to the Thing and never leave it until the suit comes to an end."</P>
<P>After that they drew lots, and Geir the Priest drew the lot to take up the suit.</P>
<P>A little after, they rode from the west over the river, and came to the spot where the meeting had been by Rangriver, and dug up the bodies, and took witness to the wounds. After that they gave lawful notice and summoned nine neighbours to bear witness in the suit.</P>
<P>They were told that Gunnar was at home with about thirty men; then Geir the Priest asked whether Gizur would ride against him with one hundred men.</P>
<P>"I will not do that," says he, "though the balance of force is great on our side."</P>
<P>After that they rode back home. The news that the suit was set on foot was spread all over the country, and the saying ran that the Thing would be very noisy and stormy.</P>
