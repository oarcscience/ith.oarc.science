<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">17. GLUM'S SLAYING</H1>
<P>Now Glum called men to follow him, and Thiostolf got ready and went with them. So they went up South Reykiardale and then up along by Baugagil and so south to Crossfell. But some of his band he sent to the Sulafells, and they all found very many sheep. Some of them, too, went by way of Scoradale, and it came about at last that those twain, Glum and Thiostolf, were left alone together. They went south from Crossfell and found there a flock of wild sheep, and they went from the south towards the fell, and tried to drive them down; but still the sheep got away from them up on the fell. Then each began to scold the other, and Thiostolf said at last that Glum had no strength save to tumble about in Hallgerda's arms.</P>
<P>Then Glum said, "'A man's foes are those of his own house.' Shall I take upbraiding from thee, runaway thrall as thou art?"</P>
<P>Thiostolf said, "Thou shalt soon have to own that I am no thrall, for I will not yield an inch to thee."</P>
<P>Then Glum got angry, and cut at him with his hand-axe, but he threw his axe in the way, and the blow fell on the haft with a downward stroke and bit into it about the breadth of two fingers. Thiostolf cut at him at once with his axe, and smote him on the shoulder, and the stroke hewed asunder the shoulderbone and collarbone, and the wound bled inwards. Glum grasped at Thiostolf with his left hand so fast, that he fell; but Glum could not hold him, for death came over him. Then Thiostolf covered his body with stones, and took off his gold ring. Then he went straight to Varmalek. Hallgerda was sitting out of doors, and saw that his axe was bloody. He said, "I know not what thou wilt think of it, but I tell thee Glum is slain."</P>
<P>"That must be thy deed," she says.</P>
<P>"So it is," he says.</P>
<P>She laughed and said, "Thou dost not stand for nothing in this sport."</P>
<P>"What thinkest thou is best to be done now?" he asked.</P>
<P>"Go to Hrut, my father's brother," she said, "and let him see about thee."</P>
<P>"I do not know," says Thiostolf, "whether this is good advice; but still I will take thy counsel in this matter."</P>
<P>So he took his horse, and rode west to Hrutstede that night. He binds his horse at the back of the house, and then goes round to the door, and gives a great knock. After that he walks round the house, north about. It happened that Hrut was awake. He sprang up at once, and put on his jerkin and pulled on his shoes. Then he took up his sword, and wrapped a cloak about his left arm, up as far as the elbow. Men woke up just as he went out; there he saw a tall stout man at the back of the house, and knew it was Thiostolf. Hrut asked him what news?</P>
<P>"I tell thee Glum is slain." says Thiostolf.</P>
<P>"Who did the deed?" says Hrut.</P>
<P>"I slew him," says Thiostolf.</P>
<P>"Why rodest thou hither?" says Hrut.</P>
<P>"Hallgerda sent me to thee," says Thiostolf.</P>
<P>"Then she has no hand in this deed," says Hrut, and drew his sword. Thiostolf saw that, and would not be behind hand, so he cuts at Hrut at once. Hrut got out of the way of the stroke by a quick turn, and at the same time struck the back of the axe so smartly with a side-long blow of his left hand, that it flew out of Thiostolf's grasp. Then Hrut made a blow with his sword in his right hand at Thiostolf's leg, just above the knee, and cut it almost off so that it hung by a little piece, and sprang in upon him at the same time, and thrust him hard back. After that he smote him on the head, and dealt him his death-blow. Thiostolf fell down on his back at full length, and then out came Hrut's men, and saw the tokens of the deed. Hrut made them take Thiostolf away, and throw stones over his body, and then he went to find Hauskuld, and told him of Glum's slaying, and also of Thiostolf's. He thought it harm that Glum was dead and gone, but thanked him for killing Thiostolf. A little while after, Thorarin Ragi's brother hears of his brother Glum's death, then he rides with eleven men behind him west to Hauskuldstede, and Hauskuld welcomed him with both hands, and he is there the night. Hauskuld sent at once for Hrut to come to him, and he went at once, and next day they spoke much of the slaying of Glum, and Thorarin said "Wilt thou make me any atonement for my brother, for I have had a great loss?"</P>
<P>Hauskuld answered, "I did not slay thy brother, nor did my daughter plot his death; but as soon as ever Hrut knew it he slew Thiostolf."</P>
<P>Then Thorarin held his peace, and thought the matter had taken a bad turn. But Hrut said, "Let us make his journey good; he has indeed had a heavy loss, and if we do that we shall be well spoken of. So let us give him gifts, and then he will be our friend ever afterwards."</P>
<P>So the end of it was, that those brothers gave him gifts, and he rode back south. He and Hallgerda changed homesteads in the spring, and she went south to Laugarness and he to Varmalek. And now Thorarin is out of the story.</P>
