# 18. FIDDLE MORD'S DEATH

Now it must be told how Fiddle Mord took a sickness and breathed his
last; and that was thought great scathe. His daughter Unna took all the
goods he left behind him. She was then still unmarried the second time.
She was very layish, and unthrifty of her property; so that her goods
and ready money wasted away, and at last she had scarce anything left
but land and stock.
