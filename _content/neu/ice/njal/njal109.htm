<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">109. OF MORD AND NJAL'S SONS</H1>
<P>It happened one day that Mord came to Berathorsknoll. He and Kari and Njal's sons fell a-talking at once, and Mord slanders Hauskuld after his wont, and has now many new tales to tell, and does naught but egg Skarphedinn and them on to slay Hauskuld, and said he would be beforehand with them if they did not fall on him at once.</P>
<P>"I will let thee have thy way in this," says Skarphedinn, "if thou wilt fare with us, and have some hand in it."</P>
<P>"That I am ready to do," says Mord, and so they bound that fast with promises, and he was to come there that evening.</P>
<P>Bergthora asked Njal, "What are they talking about out of doors?"</P>
<P>"I am not in their counsels," says Njal, "but I was seldom left out of them when their plans were good."</P>
<P>Skarphedinn did not lie down to rest that evening, nor his brothers, nor Kari.</P>
<P>That same night, when it was well-nigh spent, came Mord Valgard's son, and Njal's sons and Kari took their weapons and rode away. They fared till they came to Ossaby, and bided there by a fence. The weather was good, and the sun just risen.</P>
