<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- EXTRACTS FROM THE NJAL'S SAGA.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To Ch. 13.&nbsp; Earl Sigurd and Brian's Battle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>84.&nbsp; Now it must be told how Njal's sons, Grim and Helgi, left Iceland
the same summer that Thrain and his fellows went abroad;&nbsp; and were aboard
ship with Olaf Kettle's son of Elda, and Bard.&nbsp; They got so strong a wind
from the north that then they were driven south into the main;&nbsp; and so
thick a mist drove over them that they could not tell whither they were going,
and they were out a long while.&nbsp; Then they came to where was a great
ground-sea, and thought they must be near land.&nbsp; Njal's sons asked if Bard
could tell at all to what lands they were likely to be nearest.&nbsp;
"Many lands there are," said he, "after the set of wind that we
have had, the Orkneys, or Scotland, or Ireland."&nbsp; Two nights after
they saw land on both boards, and a great surf running up in the firth.&nbsp;
They cast anchor outside the breakers.&nbsp; Then the wind began to fall;&nbsp;
and next morning it was clear.&nbsp; Then they see thirteen ships coming out
towards them.&nbsp; Then Bard spoke and said, "What counsel shall we take
now, for these men must be going to make an onslaught on us?"&nbsp; So
they took counsel whether they should defend themselves or yield, but before
they could make up their minds the vikings were upon them.&nbsp; Then each side
asked the other their names, and what their leaders were called.&nbsp; Then the
leaders of the chapmen told their names, and asked back who might lead that
host.&nbsp; One called himself Gritgard, and the other Snowcolf, sons of Moldan
of Duncansby in Scotland, kinsmen of Malcolm the Scot king.&nbsp; "And
now," says Gritgard, "we have laid down two choices, one that ye go
on shore, and we will take your goods;&nbsp; the other is, that we fall on you
and slay every man that we catch."&nbsp; "The will of the
chapmen," sais Helgi, "is to defend themselves."&nbsp; Then the
chapmen called out, "Wretch that thou art to speak thus!&nbsp; What
defence can we make?&nbsp; Lading is less than life."&nbsp; Grim, he fell
upon a plan to shout out to the vikings, and would not let them hear the bad
grumbling of the chapmen.&nbsp; Bard and Olaf said, "Think ye not that
these Icelanders will make game of your bad manners;&nbsp; take rather your
weapons and guard your goods."&nbsp; Then they all seized their weapons
and bound themselves, one with another, never to give up so long as they had
strength to fight.</p>

<p>85.&nbsp; Then the vikings shot at them and the fight began, and the chapmen
guard themselves well.&nbsp; Snowcolf sprang at Olaf, and thrust his spear
through his body, but Grim thrust at Snowcolf with his spear, and so stoutly,
that he fell overboard.&nbsp; Then Helgi turned to meet Grim, and they drove down
all the vikings, and Njal's sons were ever where there was most need.&nbsp; The
vikings called out to the chapmen and bade them give up, but they say they
would never yield.&nbsp; Just then some one looked seaward, and there they see
ships coming from the south round the Ness, and they were not fewer than
ten.&nbsp; They row hard and steer thitherwards.&nbsp; Along their sides were
shield on shield, but on that ship that came first stood a man by the mast, who
was clad in a silken jacket, and had a gilded helm, and his hair was both fair
and thick;&nbsp; that man had a spear inlaid with gold in his hand.&nbsp; He
asked "who have here such an uneven game?"&nbsp; Helgi tells his
name, and said that against them are Gritgard and Snowcolf.&nbsp; "But who
are your captains?"&nbsp; he asks.&nbsp; Helgi answered, "Bard the
black, who lives, but the other who is dead and gone, was called
Olaf."&nbsp; "Are ye two men from Iceland?"&nbsp; says he.&nbsp;
"Sure enough we are," Helgi answers.&nbsp; He asked whose sons they
were.&nbsp; They told him, then he knew them and said, "Well known names
have ye all, father and sons both."&nbsp; "Who art thou?" says
Helgi.&nbsp; "My name is Kari, and I am Solmund's son."&nbsp;
"Whence comest thou?"&nbsp; says Helgi.&nbsp; "From the Southern
isles."&nbsp; "Then thou art welcome," says Helgi, "if thou
wilt give us a little help."&nbsp; "I'll give ye all the help ye
need," says Kari;&nbsp; "but what do ye ask?"&nbsp; "To
fall on them," says Helgi.&nbsp; Kari says that so it shall be.&nbsp; So
they pulled up to them, and then the battle began the second time;&nbsp; but
when they had fought a while, Kari springs up on Snowcolf's ship;&nbsp; he
turns to meet him and smites at him with his sword.&nbsp; Kari leaps nimbly
backwards over a beam that lay athwart the ship.&nbsp; Snowcolf smote the beam
so that both edges of the sword were hidden.&nbsp; Kari smites at him, and the
sword fell on his shoulder, and the stroke was so mighty that he cleft in twain
shoulder, arm, and all, and Snowcolf got his death there and then.&nbsp;
Gritgard hurled a spear at Kari.&nbsp; Kari saw it and sprang up aloft, and the
spear missed him.&nbsp; Just then Helgi and Grim had come up both to meet Kari,
and Helgi springs on Gritgard and thrusts his spear through him, and that was
his deathblow;&nbsp; after that they went round all the ships on both
boards.&nbsp; Then men begged for peace.&nbsp; So they gave them all peace, but
took all their goods.&nbsp; After that they ran all the ships out under the
islands.</p>

<p>86.&nbsp; Sigurd was the name of an earl who ruled over the Orkneys;&nbsp;
he was the son of Hlodver, the son of Thorfinn the scull-splitter, the son of Turf-Einar,
the son of Rognvald, earl of M&#339;ren, the son of Eystein the noisy.&nbsp; Kari
was one of earl Sigurd's bodyguard, and had taken scatts in the Southern isles
from earl Gilli.&nbsp; Now Kari asks them to go to Hrossey, and said the earl
would take to them well.&nbsp; They agreed to that, and went with Kari and came
to Hrossey.&nbsp; Kari led them to see the earl, and said what men they
were.&nbsp; "How come they," says the earl, "to fall upon
thee?"&nbsp; "I found them," says Kari, "in Scotland's
firths, and they were fighting with the sons of earl Moldan, and held their own
so well that they threw themselves about between the bulwarks, from side to
side, and were always there where the trial was greatest, and now I ask you to
give them quarters among your bodyguard."&nbsp; "It shall be as thou
choosest," says the earl, "thou hast already taken so much for them
on thy hands."&nbsp; Then they were there with the earl that winter, and
were worthily treated.&nbsp; Helgi was silent as the winter wore on.&nbsp; The
earl could not tell what was at the bottom of that, and asked why he was
silent, and what was on his mind.&nbsp; "Thinkest thou it not good to be
here?"&nbsp; "Good, methinks, it is here," he says.&nbsp;
"Then what art thou thinking about?" says the earl.&nbsp; "Hast
thou any realm to guard in Scotland?" says Helgi.&nbsp; "So we
think," says the earl, "but what of that?" &nbsp;"The
Scots," says Helgi, "must have taken your steward's life, and stopped
all news bearers, that none should cross the Pentland Firth."&nbsp; "Hast
thou the second sight?" said the earl.&nbsp; "That has been little
proved," says Helgi.&nbsp; "Well," says the earl,&nbsp; "I
will increase thy honour if this be so, otherwise thou shalt smart for
it."&nbsp; "Nay," says Kari, "Helgi is not that kind of
man, and like enough his words are sooth, for his father has the second
sight."&nbsp; After that the earl sent men south to Straumey (Stroma) to
Arnljot, his steward there, and after that Arnljot sent them across the
Pentland firth, and they spied out there and learnt that earl Hundi and earl
Melsnati had taken the life of Havard in Thraswick, Sigurd's brother in
law.&nbsp; Then Arnljot sends word to earl Sigurd to come south with a great
host and drive those earls out of his realm.&nbsp; As soon as the earl heard
that, he gathered together a mighty host.</p>

<p>87.&nbsp; After that the earl set out with his host, and Kari went with him,
and Njal's sons too.&nbsp; They came south to Caithness.&nbsp; The earl had
these realms in Scotland --- Ross, and Moray, Sutherland, and the Dales.&nbsp;
There came to meet them men from those realms, and say that the earls were a
short way off with a great host.&nbsp; Then earl Sigurd turns with his host
thither, and the name of that place is Duncansnip, beyond which they met.&nbsp;
And it came to a great battle between them.&nbsp; The Scots had let some of
their host go free from the main battle, and these took the earl's men in
flank, and many men fell there till Njal's sons turned against the foe, and
fought with them and put them to flight.&nbsp; Then it came to a hard fight,
and then Njal's sons turn back to the front by the earl's standard, and fought
well.&nbsp; Now Kari turns to meet earl Melsnati.&nbsp; Melsnati hurled a spear
at him, but Kari caught the spear and threw it back and through the earl.&nbsp;
Then earl Hundi fled, but they chased the fleers until they learnt that Malcolm
was gathering a host together at Duncansby.&nbsp; Then the earl took counsel
with his men, and it seemed to all the best plan to turn back, and not to fight
with such a mighty land force.&nbsp; Then they turned back.&nbsp; But when the
earl came to Staumey they shared the battle spoil.&nbsp; After that he went north
to Hrossey, and Njal's sons and Kari followed him.&nbsp; Then the earl made a
great feast, and at that feast he gave Kari a good sword, and a spear inlaid
with gold;&nbsp; but he gave Helgi a gold ring and a mantle, and Grim a shield
and sword.&nbsp; After that he took Helgi and Grim into his bodyguard, and
thanked them for their boldness.&nbsp; They were with the earl that winter and
the summer after, till Kari went sea roving.&nbsp; They went with him, and
harried far and wide that summer, and everywhere won the victory.&nbsp; They
fought against Godred, king of Man, and conquered him;&nbsp; and after that
they fared back, and had gotten much goods.&nbsp; Next winter they were with
the earl.&nbsp; When the spring came Njal's sons asked leave to go to
Norway.&nbsp; The earl said they should go as they pleased, and he gave them a
good ship and smart men. &nbsp;Kari says he must come that summer to Norway
with earl Hacon's scatts, and then they would meet;&nbsp; and so it fell out
that they gave each other their word as to that.&nbsp; After that Njal's sons
put out to sea and sailed for Norway, and made the land north near Drontheim.
***********</p>

<p>90.&nbsp;&nbsp; ............ After that Kari fared west across the sea to
meet earl Sigurd, and he greeted them (Kari and Njal's sons) very well, and
they were with the earl that winter.&nbsp; But when the spring came, Kari asked
Njal's sons to go on warfare with him, but Grim said they would do so if he
would fare with them afterwards out to Iceland.&nbsp; Kari gave his word to do
that.&nbsp; Then they fared with him a sea roving.&nbsp; They harried south about
Anglesea and all the Southern isles.&nbsp; Thence they held on to Cantyre, and
landed there, and fought with the landsmen, and got thence much goods, and so
fared to their ships.&nbsp; Thence they fared south to Wales, and harried
there.&nbsp; Then they held on for Man.&nbsp; There they met Godred king of Man
and fought with him, and got the victory, and slew Dungal the king's son.&nbsp;
There they took great spoil.&nbsp; Thence they held on north to Coll, and found
earl Gilli there, and he greeted them well, and there they stayed with him a
while.&nbsp; The earl fared with them to the Orkneys to meet earl Sigurd.&nbsp;
But next spring earl Sigurd gave away his sister Nereid to earl Gilli.&nbsp;
Then he fared back to the Southern isles.</p>

<p>91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That summer Kari and Njal's
sons busked them for Iceland, and when they were "all-boun" they went
to see the earl.&nbsp; The earl gave them good gifts, and they parted with
great friendship.&nbsp; Now they put to sea and have a short passage, and they
got a fine fair breeze, and made the land at Eyrar ..............</p>
