<p align="center">BRIAN'S BATTLE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>154.&nbsp; Now Flosi rides east to Hornfirth, and most of the men in his
Thring followed him, and bore his wares east, as well as all his stores and
baggage which he had to take with him.&nbsp; After that they busked them for
their voyage, and fitted out their ship.&nbsp; Now Flosi stayed by the ship
until they were "boun."&nbsp; But as soon as they got a fair wind
they put out to sea.&nbsp; They had a long passage and hard weather.&nbsp; Then
they quite lost their reckoning.&nbsp; It happened once that three great seas
broke over their ship, one after the other.&nbsp; Then Flosi said they must be
near some land, and that this was a groundswell.&nbsp; A great mist was on
them, but the wind rose so that a great gust overtook them.&nbsp; They scarce knew
where they were before they were dashed on shore at dead of night, and there
the men were saved, but the ship was dashed all to pieces, and they could not
save their goods.&nbsp; Then they had to look for shelter and warmth for
themselves.&nbsp; The day after they went up on a height.&nbsp; The weather was
then good.&nbsp; Flosi asked if any man knew this land, and there were two men
of their crew who had fared thither before, and said they were quite sure they
knew it, and, say they, "We are come to Hrossey in the Orkneys."&nbsp;
"Then we might have made a better landfall," said Flosi, "for
Grim and Helgi, Njal's sons, whom I slew, were in earl Sigurd Hlodver's son's
bodyguard."&nbsp; Then they sought for a hiding place, and spread moss
over themselves, and so lay for a while, but not for long, ere Flosi spoke, and
said, "We will not lie here so any longer until the landsmen are aware of
us."&nbsp; Then they arose and took counsel.&nbsp; Then Flosi said to his
men, "We will go all of us and give ourselves up to the earl;&nbsp; for there
is naught else to do, and the earl has our lives at his pleasure if he chooses
to seek for them."&nbsp; Then they all went away thence.&nbsp; Flosi said
that they must tell no man any tidings of their voyage or doings before he told
them to the earl.&nbsp; Then they walked on until they met men who showed them
to the homestead.&nbsp; Then they went in before the earl, and Flosi and all
the others hailed him.&nbsp; The earl asked what men they might be, and Flosi
told his name, and said out of what part of Iceland he was.&nbsp; The earl had
already heard of the Burning, and so he knew the men at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then the earl asked Flosi, "What hast thou to tell me about Helgi Njal's
son, my henchman."&nbsp; "This," said Flosi, "that I hewed
off his head."&nbsp; "Take them all," said the earl.&nbsp; Then
that was done.&nbsp; Just then in came Thorstein, son of Hall of the
Side.&nbsp; Flosi had to wife Steinvora, Thorstein's sister.&nbsp; Thorstein
was one of earl Sigurd's bodyguard.&nbsp; But when he saw Flosi seized and
held, he went in before the earl, and offered for Flosi all the goods he
had.&nbsp; The earl was very wrath a long time, but at last the end of it was,
by the prayer of good men and true, joined to those of Thorstein, for he was
well backed by friends, and many threw in their word with his, that the earl
took an atonement from them, and gave Flosi and all the rest of them
peace.&nbsp; The earl held to that custom of mighty men that Flosi took that
place in his service which Helgi Njal's son had filled.&nbsp; So Flosi was made
earl Sigurd's henchman, and he soon won his way to great love with the earl.</p>

<p>155.&nbsp; Those messmates Kari and Kolbein the black put out to sea from
Eyrar half a month later than Flosi and his companions from Hornfirth.&nbsp;
They got a fine fair wind, and were but a short time out.&nbsp; The first land
they made was the Fair isle, it lies between Shetland and the Orkneys.&nbsp;
There that man whose name was David the white took Kari into his house;&nbsp;
he tells him all that he had heard for certain about the doings of the
Burners.&nbsp; He was one of Kari's greatest friends, and Kari stayed with him
for the winter.&nbsp; Then they heard tidings from the west out of the Orkneys
of all that was done there.&nbsp; Earl Sigurd bade to his feast at Yule earl
Gilli, his brother in law, out of the Southern Isles;&nbsp; he had to wife
Swanlauga, (1) earl Sigurd's sister.&nbsp; Then too came to see earl Sigurd
that king from Ireland whose name was Sigtrygg.&nbsp; He was a son of Olaf
rattle, but his mother's name was Kormlada.&nbsp; She was the fairest of all
women, and best gifted in everything that was not in her own power, but it was
the talk of men that she did all things ill over which she had any power.
(2)&nbsp; Brian was the name of the king who first had her to wife, but they
were then parted.&nbsp; He was the best natured of all kings.&nbsp; He had his
seat in Ireland at Kincora.&nbsp; His brother's name was Wolf the quarrelsome,
the greatest champion and warrior;&nbsp; Brian's foster-child's name was
Kerthialfad.&nbsp; He was the son of king Kylfi, who had many wars with king
Brian, and fled away out of the land before him, and became a hermit.&nbsp; But
when king Brian went south on a pilgrimage, then he met king Kylfi, and they
were atoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then king Brian took his son Kerthialfad to him,
and loved him more than his own sons.&nbsp; He was then full grown when these
things happened, and was the boldest of men.&nbsp; Duncan was the name of the
first of king Brian's sons;&nbsp; the second was Margad;&nbsp; the third, Takt,
whom we call Tann, he was the youngest of them;&nbsp; but the elder sons of
king Brian were full grown, and the briskest of men.&nbsp; Kormlada was not the
mother of king Brian's children, and so grim had she got againt king Brian
after their parting, that she would gladly have him dead.&nbsp; King Brian
thrice forgave all his outlaws the same fault but if they misbehaved themselves
oftener, then he let them be judged by the law;&nbsp; and from this one may
mark what a king he must have been.&nbsp; Kormlada egged on her son Sigtrygg
very much to kill king Brian.&nbsp; She now sent him to earl Sigurd to beg for
help.&nbsp; King Sigtrygg came before Yule to the Orkneys, and there, too, came
earl Gilli, as was written before.&nbsp; Men were so placed that king Sigtrygg
sat on a high seat in the middle, but on either side of the king sat one of the
earls.&nbsp; The men of king Sigtrygg and earl Gilli sat on the inner side away
from him, but on the outer side away from earl Sigurd, sat Flosi and Thorstein,
son of Hall of the Side, and the whole hall was full.&nbsp; Now king Sigtrygg
and earl Gilli wished to hear of those tidings which had happened at the
Burning, and so, also, what had befallen since.&nbsp; Then Gunnar Lambi's son was
got to tell the tale, and a stool was set for him to sit upon.</p>

<p>156.&nbsp; Just at that very time Kari and Kolbein and David the white came
to Hrossey unawares to all men.&nbsp; They went straightway up on land, but a
few men watched the ship.&nbsp; Kari and his fellows went straight to the
earl's homestead, and came to the hall about drinking time.&nbsp; It so
happened that just then Gunnar was telling the story of the Burning, but they
were listening to him meanwhile outside.&nbsp; This was on Yule day
itself.&nbsp; Now king Sigtrygg asked, "How did Skarphedinn, bear the
burning?"&nbsp; "Well at first for a long time," said Gunnar,
"but still the end of it was that he wept."&nbsp; And he went on
giving an unfair leaning through all the story, but every now and then he lied
outright.&nbsp; Kari could not stand this.&nbsp; Then he ran in with his sword
drawn, and sang this song: ---</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Men of might in
battle eager,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boast of burning Njal's
abode, </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have the princes heard how
sturdy</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seahorse racers sought
revenge?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath not since, on foemen
holding</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High the shield's broad orb
aloft,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that wrong been fully
wroken?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raw flesh ravens got to
tear."</p>

<p>So he ran in up the hall, and smote Gunnar Lambi's son on the neck with such
a sharp blow, that his head spun off on to the board before the king and the
earls, and the board was all one gore of blood, and the earl's clothing
too.&nbsp; Earl Sigurd knew the man that had done the deed, and called out,
"Seize Kari and kill him."&nbsp; Kari had been one of earl Sigurd's
bodyguard, and he was of all men most beloved by his friends;&nbsp; and no man
stood up a whit more for the earl's speech.&nbsp; "Many would say,
Lord," said Kari, "that I have done this deed on your behalf, to
avenge your henchman."&nbsp; Then Flosi said, "Kari hath not done
this without a cause;&nbsp; he is in no atonement with us, and he only did what
he had a right to do."&nbsp; So Kari walked away, and there was no hue and
cry after him.&nbsp; Kari fared to his ship, and his fellows with him.&nbsp;
The weather was then good, and they sailed at once south to Caithness, and went
on shore at Thraswick to the house of a worthy man whose name was Skeggi, and
with him they stayed a very long while.&nbsp; Those behind in the Orkneys
cleansed the board, and bore out the dead man.&nbsp; The earl was told that they
had set sail south for Scotland.&nbsp; King Sigtrygg said, "This was a
mighty bold fellow, who dealt his stroke so stoutly, and never thought twice
about it!"&nbsp; Then earl Sigurd answered, "There is no man like
Kari for dash and daring."&nbsp; Now Flosi undertook to tell the story of
the Burning and he was fair to all;&nbsp; and therefore what he said was
believed.&nbsp; Then king Sigtrygg stirred in his business with earl Sigurd,
and egged him on to go to the war with him against king Brian.&nbsp; The earl
was long steadfast but the end of it was that he said it might come
about.&nbsp; He said he must have his mother's hand for his help, and be king
in Ireland, if they slew Brian.&nbsp; But all his men besought earl Sigurd not
to go into the war, but it was all no good.&nbsp; So they parted on the
understanding that earl Sigurd gave his word to go;&nbsp; but king Sigtrygg
promised him his mother and the kingdom.&nbsp; It was so settled that earl
Sigurd was to come with all his host to Dublin by Palm Sunday.&nbsp; Then king
Sigtrygg fared south to Ireland, and told his mother Kormlada that the earl had
undertaken to come, and also what he had pledged himself to grant him.&nbsp;
She shewed herself well pleased at that, but said they must gather greater
force still.&nbsp; Sigtrygg asked whence this was to be looked for?&nbsp; She
said there were two vikings lying off the west of Man;&nbsp; and they had
thirty ships, and "they are men of such hardihood that nothing can
withstand them.&nbsp; The one's name is Ospak, and the other's Brodir.&nbsp;
Thou shalt fare to find them, and spare nothing to get them into thy quarrel,
whatever price they ask."&nbsp; Now king Sigtrygg fares and seeks the
vikings, and found them lying outside off Man;&nbsp; king Sigtrygg brings
forward his errand at once, but Brodir shrank from helping him until he, king
Sigtrygg, promised him the kingdom and his mother, and they were to keep this
such a secret that earl Sigurd should know nothing about it;&nbsp; Brodir too
was to come to Dublin on Palm Sunday.&nbsp; King Sigtrygg fared home to his
mother, and told her how things stood.&nbsp; After that those brothers, Ospak
and Brodir, talked together, and then Brodir told Ospak all that he and
Sigtrygg had spoken of, and bade him fare to battle with him against king
Brian, and said he set much store on his going.&nbsp; Ospak said he would not
fight against so good a king.&nbsp; Then they were both wrath, and sundered
their band at once.&nbsp; Ospak had ten ships and Brodir had twenty.&nbsp;
Ospak was a heathen, and the wisest of all men.&nbsp; He laid his ships inside
in a sound, but Brodir lay outside him.&nbsp; Brodir had been a Christian man
and a mass-deacon by consecration, but he had thrown off his faith and become
God's dastard, and now worshipped heathen fiends, and he was of all men most
skilled in sorcery.&nbsp; He had that coat of mail on which no steel would
bite.&nbsp; He was both tall and strong, and had such long locks that he tucked
them under his belt.&nbsp; His hair was black.</p>

<p>157.&nbsp; It so happened one night that a great din passed over Brodir and
his men, so that they all woke, and sprang up and put on their clothes.&nbsp;
Along with that came a shower of boiling blood.&nbsp; Then they&nbsp; covered
themselves with their shields, but for all that many were scalded.&nbsp; This
wonder lasted all till day, and a man had died on board every ship.&nbsp; Then
they slept during the day.&nbsp; The second night there was again a din, and
again they all sprang up.&nbsp; Then swords leapt out of their sheaths, and
axes and spears flew about in the air and fought.&nbsp; The weapons pressed
them so hard that they had to shield themselves, but still many were wounded,
and again a man died out of every ship.&nbsp; This wonder lasted all till
day.&nbsp; Then they slept again the day after.&nbsp; The third night there was
a din of the same kind.&nbsp; Then ravens flew at them, and it seemed to them
as though their beaks and claws were of iron.&nbsp; The ravens pressed them so
hard that they had to keep them off with their swords, and covered themselves
with their shields.&nbsp; This went on again till day, and then another man had
died in every ship.&nbsp; Then they went to sleep first of all, but when Brodir
work up, he drew his breath painfully, and bade them put off the boat.&nbsp;
"For," he said, "I would go to see Ospak."&nbsp; Then he
got into the boat and some men with him.&nbsp; But when he found Ospak he told
him of the wonders which had befallen them, and bade him say what he thought
they boded.&nbsp; Ospak would not tell him before he pledged him peace, and
Brodir promised him peace but Ospak still shrank from telling him till night
fell. (3)&nbsp; Then Ospak still shrank and said ---" When blood rained on
you, therefore shall ye shed many men's blood, both of your own and
others.&nbsp; But when ye heard a great din, then ye must have been shewn the
crack of doom, and ye shall all die speedily.&nbsp; But when weapons fought
against you, that must forbode a battle;&nbsp; but when ravens pressed you,
that marks the devils which ye put faith in, and who will drag you all down to
the pains of hell."&nbsp; Then Brodir was so wroth that he could answer
never a word.&nbsp; But he went at once to his men, and made them lay his ships
in a line across the sound, and moor them by bearing cables on shore, and meant
to slay them all next morning.&nbsp; Ospak saw all their plan.&nbsp; Then he
vowed to take the true faith and to go to king Brian, and follow him till his
deathday.&nbsp; Then he took that counsel to lay his ships in a line, and punt them
along the shore with poles, and cut the cables of Brodir's ships.&nbsp; Then
the ships of Brodir's men began to fall aboard of one another.&nbsp; But they
were all fast asleep;&nbsp; and then Ospak and his men got out of the firth,
and so west to Ireland, and came to Kincora.&nbsp; Then Ospak told king Brian
all that he had learnt, and took baptism, and gave himself over into the king's
hand.&nbsp; After that king Brian made them gather force over all his realm,
and the whole host was to come to Dublin in the week before Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>158.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Sigurd Hlodver's son busked himself from the
Orkneys, and Flosi offered to go with him.&nbsp; The earl would not have that,
since he had his pilgrimage to fulfil.&nbsp; Flosi offered fifteen men of his
band to go on the voyage, and the earl accepted them, but Flosi fared with earl
Gilli to the southern isles.&nbsp; Thorstein, the son of Hall of the Side, went
along with earl Sigurd and Hrafn the red, and Erling of Straumey.&nbsp; He
would not that Hareck should go, but said he would be sure to tell him first
the tidings of his voyage.&nbsp; The earl came with all his host on Palm Sunday
to Dublin, and there too was come Brodir with all his host.&nbsp; Brodir tried
by sorcery how the fight would go.&nbsp; But the answer ran thus, that if the
fight were on Good Friday king Brian would fall but win the day;&nbsp; but if
they fought before, they would all fall who were against him.&nbsp; Then Brodir
said that they must not fight before the Friday.&nbsp; Then on the fifth day of
the week a man rode up to Kormlada and her company on an apple-gray horse, and
in his hand he held a halberd;&nbsp; he talked long with them.&nbsp; King Brian
came with all his host to the burg, and on the Friday the host fared out of the
burg, and both armies were drawn up in array.&nbsp; Brodir was on one wing of the
battle, but king Sigtrygg on the other.&nbsp; Earl Sigurd was in the mid
battle. Now it must be told of king Brian that he would not fight on the
fastday, and so a shieldburg (4) was thrown round him, and his host was drawn
up in array in front of it.&nbsp; Wolf the quarrelsome was on that wing of the
battle against which Brodir stood.&nbsp; But on the other wing, were Sigtrygg
stood against them, were Ospak and his sons.&nbsp; But in mid-battle was
Kerthialfad, and before him the banners were borne.&nbsp; Now the wings fall on
one another, and there was a very hard fight.&nbsp; Brodir went through the
host of the foe, and felled all the foremost that stood there, but no steel
would bite on him.&nbsp; Wolf the quarrelsome turned then to meet him, and
thrust at him twice so hard that Brodir fell before him at each thrust, and was
well-night not getting on his feet again.&nbsp; But as soon as ever he found
his feet, he fled away into the wood at once.&nbsp; Earl Sigurd had a hard
battle against Kerthialfad, and Kerthialfad came on so fast that he laid low all
who were in the front rank, and he broke the array of earl Sigurd right up to
his banner, and slew the bannerbearer.&nbsp; Then he got another man to bear
the banner, and there was again a hard fight.&nbsp; Kerthialfad smote this man
to his death at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near
him.&nbsp; Then earl Sigurd called on Thorstein, the son of Hall of the Side,
to bear the banner, and Thorstein was just about to lift the banner, but then
Amundi the white said, "Don't bear the banner!&nbsp; for all they who bear
it get their death."&nbsp; "Hrafn the red!"&nbsp; called out
earl Sigurd, "Bear thou the banner."&nbsp; "Bear thine own devil
thyself," answered Hrafn.&nbsp; Then the earl said "Tis fittest that
the beggar should bear the bag;"&nbsp; and with that he took the banner
from the staff and put it under his cloak.&nbsp; A little after Amundi the
white was slain, and then the earl was pierced through with a spear.&nbsp;
Ospak had gone through all the battle on his wing, he had been sore wounded,
and lost both his sons ere king Sigtrygg fled before him.&nbsp; Then flight
broke out throughout all the host.&nbsp; Thorstein Hall of the Side's son stood
still while all the others fled, and tied his shoestring.&nbsp; Then
Kerthialfad asked why he ran not as the others.&nbsp; "Because," said
Thorstein, "I can't get home tonight, since I am at home out in
Iceland."&nbsp; Kerthialfad gave him peace.&nbsp; Hrafn the red was chased
out into a certain river;&nbsp; he thought he saw there the pains of hell down
below him and he thought the devils wanted to drag him to them.&nbsp; Then
Hrafn said, "Thy dog, (5) Apostle Peter! hath run twice to Rome, and he
would run a third time if thou gavest him leave."&nbsp; Then the devils
let him loose, and Hrafn got across the river.&nbsp; Now Brodir saw that king
Brian's men were chasing the fleers, and that there were few men by the
Shieldburg.&nbsp; Then he rushed out of the wood, and broke through the
shieldburg, and hewed at the king.&nbsp; The lad Takt threw his arm in the way,
and the stroke took it off and the king's head too, but the king's blood came
on the lad's stump, and the stump was healed by it on the spot.&nbsp; Then
Brodir called out with a loud voice, "Now man can tell man that Brodir
felled Brian."&nbsp; Then men ran after those who were chasing the fleers,
and they were told that king Brian had fallen, and then they turned back straightway,
both Wolf the quarrelsome and Kerthialfad.&nbsp; Then they threw a ring round
Brodir and his men, and threw branches of trees upon them, and so Brodir was
taken alive.&nbsp; Wolf the quarrelsome cut open his belly, and led him round
and round the trunk of a tree, and so wound all his entrails out of him, and he
did not die before they were all drawn out of him.&nbsp; Brodir's men were
slain to a man.&nbsp; After that they took king Brian's body and laid it
out.&nbsp; The king's head had grown to the trunk.&nbsp; Fifteen men of the
Burners fell in Brian's battle, and there too fell Halldor the son of Gudmund
the powerful, and Erling of Straumey.&nbsp; On Good Friday that event happened
in Caithness that a man whose name was Daurrud went out.&nbsp; He saw folk
riding twelve together to a bower, and there they were all lost to his
sight.&nbsp; He went to the bower.&nbsp; He looked in through a window slit
that was in it and saw that there were women inside, and they had set up a
loom.&nbsp; Men's heads were the weights, but men's entrail's were the warp and
weft.&nbsp; A sword served for a shuttle, and the reels were arrows.&nbsp; They
sang these songs, but he learnt them by heart --</p>

<p>THE WOOF OF WAR</p>

<p>"See!&nbsp; warp is stretched</p>

<p>For warriors' fall,</p>

<p>Lo!&nbsp; weft in loom</p>

<p>'Tis wet with blood;</p>

<p>Now fight foreboding,</p>

<p>'Neath friends' swift fingers,</p>

<p>Our gray woof waxeth</p>

<p>With war's alarms,</p>

<p>Our warp bloodred,</p>

<p>Our weft corseblue.</p>

<p>This woof is y-woven</p>

<p>With entrails of men,</p>

<p>This warp is hardweighted</p>

<p>With heads of the slain,</p>

<p>Spears blood-besprinkled</p>

<p>For spindles we use,</p>

<p>Our loom ironbound,</p>

<p>And arrows our reels;</p>

<p>With swords for our shuttles</p>

<p>This war-woof we work;</p>

<p>So weave we, weird sisters,</p>

<p>Our warwinning woof.</p>

<p>Now War-winner walketh</p>

<p>To weave in her turn,</p>

<p>Now Swordswinger steppeth,</p>

<p>Now Swiftstroke, now Storm;</p>

<p>When they speed the shuttle</p>

<p>How spearheads shall flash!</p>

<p>Shields crash, and helm-gnawer (6)</p>

<p>On harnes bite hard!</p>

<p>Wind we wind swiftly</p>

<p>Our warwinning woof,</p>

<p>Woof erst for king youthful</p>

<p>Foredoomed as his own.</p>

<p>Forth now we will ride,</p>

<p>Then through the ranks rushing,</p>

<p>Be busy where friends</p>

<p>Blows blithe give and take.</p>

<p>Wind we, wind swiftly</p>

<p>Our warwinning woof,</p>

<p>After that let us steadfastly</p>

<p>Stand by the brave king;</p>

<p>Then men shall mark mournful</p>

<p>Their shields red with gore,</p>

<p>How Swordstroke and Spearthrust</p>

<p>Stood stout by the prince.</p>

<p>Wind we, wind swiftly</p>

<p>Our warwinning woof;</p>

<p>When sword-bearing rovers</p>

<p>To banners rush on,</p>

<p>Mind, maidens, we spare not</p>

<p>One life in the fray!</p>

<p>We corse-choosing sisters</p>

<p>Have charge of the slain.</p>

<p>Now new-coming nations</p>

<p>That island shall rule,</p>

<p>Who on outlying headlands</p>

<p>Abode ere the fight;</p>

<p>I say that king mighty</p>

<p>To death now is done,</p>

<p>Now low before spear point</p>

<p>That earl bows his head.</p>

<p>Soon over all Ersemen</p>

<p>Sharp sorrow shall fall, </p>

<p>That woe to those warriors</p>

<p>Shall wane nevermore.</p>

<p>Our woof now is woven,</p>

<p>Now battlefield waste,</p>

<p>O'er land and o'er water</p>

<p>War tidings shall leap.</p>

<p>Now surely 'tis gruesome</p>

<p>To gaze all around,</p>

<p>When blood-red through heaven</p>

<p>Drives cloudrack o'er head;</p>

<p>Air soon shall be deep hued</p>

<p>With dying men's blood</p>

<p>When this our spaedom</p>

<p>Comes speedy to pass.</p>

<p>So cheerily chant we</p>

<p>Charms for the young king,</p>

<p>Come maidens lift loudly</p>

<p>His warwinning lay;</p>

<p>Let him who now listens</p>

<p>Learn well with his ears,</p>

<p>And gladden brave swordsmen</p>

<p>With bursts of war's song.</p>

<p>Now mount we our horses,</p>

<p>Now bare we our brands, </p>

<p>Now haste we hard, maidens,</p>

<p>Hence far, far, away."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they plucked down the
woof and tore it asunder, and each kept what she had hold of.&nbsp; Now Daurrud
goes away from the slit, and home;&nbsp; but they got on thier steeds and rode
six to the south, and the other six to the north.&nbsp; A like event befell
Brand Gneisti's son in the Faroe isles.&nbsp; At Swinefell, in Iceland, blood
came on the priest's stole on Good Friday, so that he had to put it off.&nbsp;
At Thvattwater the priest thought he saw on Good Friday a deep of the sea hard
by the altar, and there he saw many awful sights, and it was long ere he could
sing the hours.&nbsp; This even happened in the Orkneys, that Hareck thought he
saw earl Sigurd, and some men with him.&nbsp; Then Hareck took his horse and
rode to meet the earl.&nbsp; Men saw that they met and rode under a brae, but
they were never seen again, and not a scrap was ever found of Hareck.&nbsp;
Earl Gilli in the Southern isles dreamed that a man came to him and said his
name was Hostfinn, and told him he was come from Ireland.&nbsp; The earl
thought he asked him for tidings thence, and then he sang this song.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I have been were warriors wrestled,</p>

<p>High in Erin sang the sword,</p>

<p>Ross to boss met many bucklers,</p>

<p>Steel run sharp on rattling helm;</p>

<p>I can tell of all their struggle;</p>

<p>Sigurd fell in flight of spears; </p>

<p>Brian fell, but kept his kingdom</p>

<p>Ere he lost one drop of blood."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those two, Flosi and the
earl, talked much of this dream.&nbsp; A week after, Hrafn the red came
thither, and told them all the tidings of Brian's battle, the fall of the king
and of earl Sigurd, and Brodir, and all the vikings.&nbsp; "What,"
said Flosi, "hast thou to tell me of my men?"&nbsp; "They all
fell there," says Hrafn, "but thy brother in law Thorstein took peace
from Kerthialfad, and is now with him."&nbsp; Flosi says to the earl that
he would now go away, "for we have our pilgrimage south to
fulfill."&nbsp; The earl bade him go as he wished, and gave him a ship and
all else that he needed, and much silver.&nbsp; Then they sailed to Wales, and
stayed there a while.</p>

<p>159.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kari, Solmund's son, told master Skeggi that he
wished he would get him a ship.&nbsp; So master Skeggi gave Kari a longship,
fully trimmed and manned, and on board it went Kari, and David the white, and
Kolbein the black.&nbsp; Now Kari and his fellows sailed south off Scotland's
firths, and there they found men from the Southern isles.&nbsp; They told Kari
the tidings from Ireland, and also that Flosi was gone to Wales, and his men
with him.&nbsp; But when Kari heard that he told his messmates that he would
hold on south to Wales, to fall in with Flosi and his band.&nbsp; He bade them
then to part from his company, if they liked it better, and said that he would
not wish to beguile any man into mischief, because he thought he had not yet
had revenge enough on them for his wrongs.&nbsp; All chose to go with
him.&nbsp; Then he sails south to Wales, and there they lay in hiding in a
creek out of the way.&nbsp; That morning Kol Thorstein's son went into the town
to buy silver.&nbsp; He of all the burners had used the bitterest words.&nbsp;
Kol had talked much with a mighty dame, and he had so knocked the nail on the
head, that it was all but fixed that he was to have her, and settle down
there.&nbsp; That same morning Kari went also into the town.&nbsp; He came up
when Kol was telling the silver.&nbsp; Kari knew him, and ran at him with drawn
sword and smote him on the neck.&nbsp; But he still went on telling the silver,
and his head counted "ten" just as it spun off the body.&nbsp; Kari
said, "Go and tell this to Flosi, that Kari Solmund's son hath slain Kol
Thorstein's son.&nbsp; I give notice of this slaying as done by my
hand."&nbsp; Then Kari went to his ship, and told his shipmates of the
manslaughter.&nbsp; Then they sailed north to Beruwick, and laid up their ship,
and fared up into Whitherne in Scotland, and were with earl Malcolm that
year.&nbsp; But when Flosi heard of Kol's slaying, he laid out his body, and
bestowed much money on his burial.&nbsp; Flosi never uttered any wrathful words
against Kari.&nbsp; Thence Flosi fared south across the sea and began his
pilgrimage, and went on south, and did not stop till he came to Rome.&nbsp;
There he got so great honour that he took absolution from the Pope himself, and
for that he gave a great sum of money.&nbsp; Then he fared back again by the
east road, and stayed long in towns, and went in before mighty men, and had
from them great honour.&nbsp; He was in Norway the winter after, and took a
ship from earl Eric to sail out, and he gave him much meal, and many other men
behaved handsomely to him.&nbsp; Now he sailed out to Iceland, and ran into Hornfirth,
and thence fared home to Swinefell.&nbsp; He had then fulfilled all the terms
of his atonement, both in fines and foreign travel.</p>

<p>160.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is to be told of Kari that the summer
after he went down to his ship and sailed south across the sea, and began his
pilgrimage in Normandy.&nbsp; And went south and got absolution and fared back
by the western way, and took his ship again in Normandy, and sailed in her
north across the sea to Dover in England.&nbsp; Thence he sailed west, round
Wales, and so north, off Scotland's firths, and did not stay his course till he
came to Thraswick in Caithness, to master Skeggi's house.&nbsp; Then he gave
over the ship of burden to Kolbein and David.&nbsp; Kolbein sailed in that ship
to Norway, but David stayed behind in the Fair isle.&nbsp; Kari was that winter
in Caithness.&nbsp; In this winter his housewife died out in Iceland.&nbsp; The
next summer Kari busked him for Iceland.&nbsp; Skeggi gave him a ship of
burden, and there were eighteen of them on board her.&nbsp; They were rather
late "boun," but still they put to sea, and had a long passage, but
at last they made Ingolf's-head.&nbsp; There their ship was dashed all to
pieces, but the men's lives were saved.&nbsp; Then, too, a snow-storm came on
them.&nbsp; Now they ask Kari what counsel shall be taken;&nbsp; but he said
their best plan was to go to Swinefell and put Flosi's manhood to the
proof.&nbsp; Now they went right up to Swinefell in the storm.&nbsp; Flosi was
in the sitting room.&nbsp; He knew Kari as soon as ever he came into the room,
and sprang up to meet him, and kissed him, and sat him down in the high seat by
his side.&nbsp; Flosi asked Kari to be there that winter, and Kari took his
offer.&nbsp; Then they were atoned with a full atonement.&nbsp; Then Flosi gave
away his brother's daughter Hildigunna, whom Hauskuld the priest of Whiteness
had had to wife to Kari.&nbsp; They dwelt first at Broadwater.&nbsp; Men say
that the end of Flosi's life was, that he fared abroad, when he had grown old,
to seek for timber to build him a hall;&nbsp; and he was in Norway that
winter;&nbsp; but the next summer he was late "boun."&nbsp; Men told
him that his ship was not seaworthy.&nbsp; Flosi said she was good enough for
an old and "fey" man, and bore his goods shipboard and put out to
sea.&nbsp; But of that ship no tidings were ever heard.&nbsp; These were the children
of Kari Solmud's son and Helga Njal's daughter --- Thorgerda and Ragneida,
Valgerda, and Thord who was burnt in Njal's house.&nbsp; But the children of
Hildigunna and Kari were these, Starkad, and Thord, and Flosi.&nbsp; The son of
Burning-Flosi was Kolbein, who had been the most famous man of any of that
stock.&nbsp; And here we end the story of Burnt Njal.</p>
