<p align="center">THE STORY OF EARL ROGNVALD</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>61.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cecilia (1) was the name of a
sister of earl Magnus, born in wedlock.&nbsp; She was given away east in
Norway, and that man whose name was Isaac had her to wife.&nbsp; Their son&#146;s
name was Kol.&nbsp; Kol (Kali&#146;s son) sate on his farms in Agdir, as was written
before, and was the wisest of all men.&nbsp; He did not fare into the
Orkneys.&nbsp; Kol was a very shrewd man.&nbsp; Kali his son grew up there, and
was the most hopeful (2) man, a middleman in growth, well set up, one of the
best limbed of men, with light brown hair.&nbsp; He had more friends than most
men, and was a more proper man, both in body and mind, than most of the other
men of his time.&nbsp; He made this song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Draughts I play with open hand,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Games and feats so skilful nine;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Writing runes to me comes ready;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Books I read and smith&#146;s work furnish;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I can glide on snow-shoon swift;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doughtily I shoot and row;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Either stands at my behest,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sweep of harp or burst of song.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kali was almost always with
Solmund his kinsman, the son of Sigurd supple.&nbsp; He was (the king&#146;s)
steward at Tunsberg, and had a house of his own at East Agdir.&nbsp; He was a
chief, and had a great following.&nbsp; They were much of an age, those
kinsmen.</p>

<p>62.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kali was fifteen winters old when he
fared with chapmen west to England, and had good wares for traffic.&nbsp; They
held on their course to that town which is called Grimsby.&nbsp; Thither came a
very great crowd of men both from Norway, the Orkneys, and from Scotland, and
so also from the Southern isles.&nbsp; There Kali met that man who went by the
name of Gillikrist. (3)&nbsp; He asked then much about Norway, and talked most
with Kali;&nbsp; there was a great fellowship sprung up (between them).&nbsp;
He told Kali as a secret that his name was Harold, and that king Magnus
barelegs was his father, but that his mother&#146;s stock was in the Southern isles,
and some of them in Ireland.&nbsp; He asked Kali how he thought he would be
welcomed if he came to Norway.&nbsp; Kali says he thought king Sigurd likely to
give him a good welcome if other men did not spoil matters between them.&nbsp;
They, Gillikrist and Kali, exchanged gifts at their parting;&nbsp; each
promised the other his thorough friendship wherever their next meeting might
be.&nbsp; But Gillikrist does not tell his secret to more men in that place.</p>

<p>63.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that Kali fared from the west
on board the same ship, and they came from abroad at Agdir, and held on thence
north to Bergen.&nbsp; Then Kali sang this song:</p>

<p>Weeks of grimmest walking five</p>

<p>We have waded through the mud;</p>

<p>In mid Grimsby where we were,</p>

<p>Was no want of mud and mire.</p>

<p>Now it is with merry minds,</p>

<p>O&#146;er the sea-moors (4) that we let,</p>

<p>Beaked elk (5) across the billow,</p>

<p>Blithely bound to Bergen home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they came to the
town, they found there a great crowd of men out the land, both from the north
and from the south, and many, too, from other lands, who had flitted thither
much goods.&nbsp; Then those shipmates went into the taverns to make
merry.&nbsp; Kali was then a great man for dress, and had many braveries with
him as he was newly come from England.&nbsp; Then he thought much of himself,
and many others thought so too, for he came of a good stock, and was a
well-bred man in himself.&nbsp; But in that tavern where he drank he found a
young man of rank whose name was John;&nbsp; he was the son of Peter Sark&#146;s son
of Sogn.&nbsp; He was then one of the king&#146;s liegemen.&nbsp; His mother&#146;s name
was Helga, a daughter of Harek of S&aelig;ter.&nbsp; John was a very showy man in his
dress.&nbsp; Unna was the name of a worthy housewife who owned the house in
which they drank.&nbsp; Then there arose a great fellowship between those two,
John and Kali, and they parted with love;&nbsp; John fared then south (6) to
Sogn, to his abode, but Kali east to Agdir, to his father.&nbsp; Kali was also
often with Solmund his kinsman.&nbsp; So it went on for some half years, that
Kali was in the summers on trading voyages, but at home in the winters or with
his kinsman Solmund.</p>

<p>64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it fell out one summer, when Kali
had fared north to Drontheim, that he lay weather-bound under that island which
is called Doll. (7)&nbsp; In the isle was a great cave, which is called Doll&#146;s
cave.&nbsp; In the cave was great hope of treasure.&nbsp; The chapmen made
ready, and went into the cave, and had the hardest work to make their way
there.&nbsp; They came where water stood across the cave, and none dared to
fare across the water save Kali and another man, whose name was Havard,
Solmund&#146;s house-carle.&nbsp; They swam across the water, and had a rope between
them.&nbsp; Kali swam first, and had in his hand a blazing torch and a
tinder-box between his shoulders. (8)&nbsp; So they swam over the water and
came to land.&nbsp; That place was rough and rugged, and there was a great
stench, and they could scarce get the light struck.&nbsp; Then Kali gave out
that they would go no farther, and said they should make a beacon there as a
memorial.&nbsp; Then Kali sang a song:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here have I built in darksome cave</p>

<p>Of Doll a beacon high</p>

<p>To goblin grim of sternest mood,</p>

<p>So golden store I sought,</p>

<p>None knows what man of those who work</p>

<p>The water-skates (9) will wend his way,</p>

<p>His long and weary path, once more</p>

<p>Across this water wide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that they turned back
and came safe and sound to their men, then they fared out of the cave;&nbsp; it
is not told about their journey that any tidings happened that summer.&nbsp;
They came back to Bergen, and Kali turned into the same tavern to Unna the
housewife.&nbsp; There too he found again John Peter&#146;s son and his serving-man,
whose name was Brynjulf.&nbsp; There were there besides many others of his men,
though they are not named.&nbsp; It happened one evening that they John Peter&#146;s
son and Kali, were gone to sleep, but many sat behind and drank.&nbsp; Then
there was much talk, when men were well drunk;&nbsp; and it came about that
they spoke of matching one man with another, and of who were thought to be
noblest of the king&#146;s liegemen in Norway.&nbsp; Brynjulf stood up that John
Peter&#146;s son was the best bred and best born of the younger men south of Stad;
(10)&nbsp; but Havard Kali&#146;s companion spoke up for Solmund, and said he was no
worse bred than John, and declared that the dwellers in the Bay would set much
greater store by him than by John Peter&#146;s son.&nbsp; Out of this a great strife
arose, and when the ale spoke in them, then no better heed was taken than this,
that up jumped Havard and got him a cudgel and gave Brynjulf there and then
such a blow on the head that he fell down at once senseless, and men ran to
help him up;&nbsp; but Havard was packed off to see Kali, and Kali sent him
south into Alvidra to a priest whose name was Richard, &#8220;and bring him,&#8221; he
says, &#8220;my message that I beg him to take thee in till I go home east.&#8221;&nbsp;
Kali got him a man to bear him company, and a boat, and they row away south
till they come to Gr&aelig;ning Sound.&nbsp; Then Havard said to his
fellow-traveller:&nbsp; &#8220;Now we two are come beyond the bark of hounds, and we
will rest ourselves here,&#8221; and with that they lie down to sleep.&nbsp; Now we
must take up our story and say that Brynjulf came to his wits, and he was
carried to see John, and he tells him all that had happened, and how the man
had been packed off there and then.&nbsp; John guessed the truth as to his
doings, and made them take a rowing-cutter, and ten men got into her;&nbsp;
Brynjulf was there to lead the men.&nbsp; After that they row south, and come
south into Gr&aelig;ning Sound, (11) when it was getting daylight.&nbsp; Then they
saw that a boat lay before them on the beach, &#8220;and may be,&#8221; says Brynjulf,
&#8220;that these men will be able to tell us something of Havard.&#8221;&nbsp; So they
went up on land and found them;&nbsp; Havard and his mate were then just
awake.&nbsp; Brynjulf fell on Havard at once with the sword, and both those
companions were slain at that meeting.&nbsp; And now Brynjulf and his men fared
back to Bergen after these tidings, and tell them to John;&nbsp; and after that
all the townsfolk knew them.&nbsp; Kali took the tidings of these slayings very
ill;&nbsp; and when men came between him and John, John says that his wish is
that Kali shall alone make his award as to the wrong which he thinks he has
suffered, but that should be saving the king&#146;s right and that of the next of
kin to take the feud up.&nbsp; And Kali agreed to those terms, but still there
was no love between him and John.&nbsp; Then Kali fared home east very soon
after that;&nbsp; and when he and his father met, and Kali had told about those
tidings and the close of his quarrel, then Kol says:&nbsp; &#8220;Methought thou wert
showing thyself in a strange light when thou tookest any atonement before thy
kinsman Solmund were by;&nbsp; now methinks thou has come into a strait, and
canst take little part in the matter, except to ask for atonement;&nbsp; and so
would not Solmund do if thy house-carle were slain and his shipmate.&#8221;&nbsp; Kali
says:&nbsp; &#8220;Thou speakest the truth, no doubt, father, when thou sayest that I
have been too hasty in looking at the matter;&nbsp; but thou wert too far off
to teach me what to do.&nbsp; It will often be shown too that I am not so
deep-witted as thou, but still I thought this, that Solmund would be never the
nearer his due though I forsook that which was offered to me;&nbsp; and I do
not call it a disgrace either to Solmund or to thee to accept the right to fix
your own terms from John for your share in the suit, if he offers it you, though
I very much doubt whether there is any need for you to take up the
matter.&nbsp; But as for myself, I call myself quite free as to Brynjulf, so
long as I have come to no final utterance in the matter, and taken no money in
atonement.&#8221;&nbsp; So that father and son talked much together, and each of them
drew his own way about it; (12)&nbsp; then they sent men to tell Solmund those
tidings.&nbsp; After that Kol and Kali and Solmund met;&nbsp; Kol wished that
men should be sent to John to seek for an atonement;&nbsp; but Solmund and
Hallvard, Havard&#146;s brother, would hear of nothing but revenge, man for
man;&nbsp; and said it was unseemly to ask a Sogn man for atonement.&nbsp; But
for all that the plan was taken which Kol wished, with this understanding, that
Kol gave his word not to withdraw from this suit before Solmund got what was
due to his honour.&nbsp; Kol too was to have the whole management of the matter
in his hands.&nbsp; But when the messengers came back, they say that their
business was taken up slowly and unwillingly;&nbsp; and John refused right out
to atone for that man with money who had before made himself an outlaw by his
deeds.&nbsp; Solmund said that had gone just after his guess, that it would
bring them little honour to ask John for an atonement;&nbsp; and now he begged
Kol to give them some advice that was worth having.&nbsp; Kol says:&nbsp; &#8220;Will
Hallvard run any risk to get revenge for &#8220;his brother, and may be that after
all there may be little brought about.&#8221;&nbsp; Hallvard said he would not spare
himself to get revenge for his brother, even though there were risk of life in
it.&nbsp; Kol says:&nbsp; &#8220;Then shalt thou fare north stealthily to Sogn to
that man whose name is Uni;&nbsp; he dwells hard by John:&nbsp; he is a wise
man and rather short of money, for John has long elbowed him out of his
means.&nbsp; He is a great friend (of mine), and now rather stricken in
years.&nbsp; To him thou shalt bring six marks weighed, which I send him that
he may lay some plan how thou mayest wreak thy revenge on Brynjulf, or some
other man of John&#146;s household, whom he will think not less loss (than Brynjulf.)&nbsp;
But if this deed be fulfilled, then Uni shall send thee on to Studla (13) to
Kyrping-Worm my kinsman, and his sons Ogmund and Erling, and then methinks thou
art as good as come home.&nbsp; Bid Uni after that to sell his land, and change
his abode hither to me.&#8221;&nbsp; Now Hallvard busked him to this journey, and
nothing is told of how he fared, or where his night-quarters were, before he
came one day at evening to Uni&#146;s house, and did not call himself by his own
name.&nbsp; Uni and his household asked him about the news of the day, and at
night when men sat by the fires, then the guest asked much about high-born men
there in Sogn and H&ouml;rdaland.&nbsp; Uni said that none of the king&#146;s liegemen
there was thought more powerful than John, both for his birth&#146;s sake, but still
more for his unfairness, and asked whether they had not some keepsakes of that
down south in the land.&nbsp; The guest he said little when he (Uni) spoke
thus;&nbsp; and after that men dropped off from the fires one by one, so that
at last they two were left behind.&nbsp; Then Uni began to speak, and said
thus:&nbsp; &#8220;Is thy name Hallvard, pray?&#8221; says he.&nbsp; &#8220;Nay,&#8221; says the guest,
and again gave the name he had given in the evening.&nbsp; Then Uni said:&nbsp;
&#8220;Off then is my difficulty,&#8221; says he, &#8220;and yet I would have thought that if my
name were Brynjulf, thine would be Hallvard;&nbsp; but still we two will now go
to sleep.&#8221;&nbsp; Then the guest took hold of him, and said:&nbsp; &#8220;No, we two
will not go yet,&#8221; and with that he handed him over the bag of money, and says
that Kol sent him that silver, with his greeting, &#8220;and why he sends it is that
thou mayest lay a plan with me that I may fulfil my revenge for my brother,&#8221;
and then he tells him all Kol&#146;s counsel.&nbsp; Uni said:&nbsp; &#8220;Kol were worthy
of good from me, but I cannot tell how it is fated as to revenge on Brynjulf;&nbsp;
but he is looked for hither tomorrow to fetch clothes from his
sweetheart.&#8221;&nbsp; And now Uni led him out to the horse-stable which stood
before the door outside, and stowed him away there in the manger.&nbsp; That
was before men rose, but he had lain indoors during the night.&nbsp; Now, when
Hallvard had been a little while in the horse stable, he saw how a huge man had
come up to the homestead, and calls out that the woman must be quick;&nbsp; she
took her clothes, and carries them out.&nbsp; Then Hallvard thinks he knows who
it must be.&nbsp; So he goes out.&nbsp; Brynjulf had laid aside his arms while
he tied up the clothes which the woman brought, and as soon as ever they meet,
Hallvard smites Brynjulf his death-blow, and then went back again into the
horse stable, and hid himself there.&nbsp; While the slaying was going on the
woman had gone into the house to kiss and take leave of her friends in the
household;&nbsp; and when she came out she saw the tokens of the deed, and ran
in with a great shriek, and was in such a fright that she was just about to
faint away, but still she told them what had happened.&nbsp; Goodman Uni ran
out, and said that the guest must have been a hired murderer, and sent a man at
once to John to tell these tidings, and egged on men as much as he could to
search for the man, and for that no man suspected him of having anything to do
with the deed.&nbsp; Hallvard was in the horse stable till the hottest of the
chase had passed off, but after that he fared by Uni&#146;s help and counsel till he
came to Studla to Worm and his sons, and they got him company home east.&nbsp;
Kol and Solmund made him welcome, and were well pleased with their share in the
matter;&nbsp; and now these tidings are noised abroad, and men became aware of
the truth.&nbsp; Now John is heavily displeased at this, and so that winter and
the summer after pass away;&nbsp; and thenext winter when Yule was drawing on,
John busked him from home with thirty men, and gave it out that he meant to go
on a journey to see his kinsfolk up at S&aelig;ter to the house of Harek, his
mother&#146;s father, and so he did, and gets there a hearty welcome.&nbsp; And when
those kinsmen were talking together, John says that he means to go thence to
East Agdir to look up Solmund.&nbsp; Harek tried to turn him from this, and
said he had not got the worst of it, though they (John and Solmund) parted as
they were.&nbsp; John said he would not be content that Brynjulf should be
unavenged.&nbsp; Harek said he thought his lot would not be bettered, though
they (John and Solmund) had any further dealings in the matter;&nbsp; but still
he had with him away thence thirty men, and so they fared east with half a
hundred men (14) by the upper road, and thought to come unawares upon Solmund
and Kol.&nbsp; But when John was newly gone from home, Uni bestirred himself
and fared south to Studla to see Worm, and that father and son got him company
south to Kol, and he came there at Yule, and told them he thought that John was
on his way to attack them.&nbsp; Kol sends out spies at once on all the ways
about him, by which he looked that John might come, and he fared to find Solmund;&nbsp;
and those kinsmen sat with a great company.&nbsp; News came to them about
John&#146;s journey, and they fared against him;&nbsp; their meeting was in a
wood;&nbsp; they fell at once to battle;&nbsp; Kol and his men were far more in
number, and had the victory.&nbsp; But John lost many men and fled himself into
the woods.&nbsp; He got a wound in his leg, and that healed so ill that he was
halt ever after, and was called limp-leg John.&nbsp; He came home north in
Lent, and his journey was thought most shameful.&nbsp; So now this winter wore
away.&nbsp; But the summer after John made them slay two of Kol&#146;s kinsmen,
Gunnar and Aslak.&nbsp; A little after king Sigurd came to the town, (15) and
this difficulty was brought before him.&nbsp; After that the king sent word to
both sides, and summoned them to him.&nbsp; Then they came to the king, with
their kinsfolk and friends;&nbsp; then an atonement was sought, and the end of
it was that the king&#146;s doom should pass upon all their quarrels, and either
side plighted their troth to the other.&nbsp; King Sigurd made a settlement
between them with the advice of the best men.&nbsp; It was so fixed in that
settlement that John Peter&#146;s son should take Ingirid Kol&#146;s daughter to wife,
and then friendship would spring up with those ties, while the manslaughters
(of Havard and Brynjulf) were to be set off one against the other.&nbsp; The
attack on Kol and John&#146;s wound were set off against the loss of men away there
east, but the wounds on either side were matched together and set off, and
those that were odd were atoned for in money.&nbsp; Each side too was to yield
help to the other both at home and abroad.&nbsp; It followed also on this
settlement that king Sigurd gave Kali Kol&#146;s son half the Orkneys with earl Paul
Hacon&#146;s son, and the title of earl too.&nbsp; He also gave him the name of earl
Rognvald Brusi&#146;s son, because his mother Gunnhilda said that he had been the
most proper man of all the Orkney earls, and thought the name would bring good
luck.&nbsp; This share of the Orkneys Saint Magnus had owned, Rognvald-Kali&#146;s
mother&#146;s brother.&nbsp; After this atonement they parted with great
love-tokens;&nbsp; they who had erewhile been foes.</p>

<p>65.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That winter after king Sigurd sat in
Oslo, (16) but about the spring in Lent he took a sickness, and breathed his
last one night after Lady-day.&nbsp; His son Magnus was then in the town there,
and held a Thing at once, and was taken to be king over all the land according
to the oath which men had sworn to king Sigurd.&nbsp; Then he took the king&#146;s
treasures into his power.&nbsp; Harold Gilli was then at Tunsberg, (17) when he
heard of king Sigurd&#146;s death, then he held meetings with his friends.&nbsp;
Then he sent for Rognvald and his kindred, for he had always been his friend
(18) since they met in England.&nbsp; That father and son too had most hand in
Harold&#146;s clearing himself by ordeal before king Sigurd, with the help of other
liegemen, Ingimar Sweyn&#146;s son and Thiostolf Ali&#146;s son.&nbsp; The counsel of
Harold and his friends was to hold the Hauga-Thing there in Tunsberg.&nbsp;
There Harold was taken to be king over half the land.&nbsp; Then those were
called force-oaths (19) by which he had sworn away his fathers inheritance out
of his hands before they would let him take the ordeal.&nbsp; Then men flocked
to him and became hand-bound to him, and he gathered a very great
company.&nbsp; Then words passed between those kinsmen.&nbsp; And it was so
that seven nights passed ere a settlement was brought about on these terms,
that each of them should have half the land against the other;&nbsp; but king
Magnus had (beside) king Sigurd&#146;s longship and his table furniture and all his
treasures, and yet he still was not content with his share.&nbsp; He fastened
feuds on all Harold&#146;s friends.&nbsp; King Magnus too would not let that gift
hold good by which king Sigurd gave the Orkneys and the earldom to Rognvald,
because he clung very fast to Harold&#146;s cause in all their quarrels, and would
never leave his cause till all their quarrels were brought to an end.&nbsp;
They, Magnus and Harold, were three winters kings over Norway, so that their
settlement might be said to hold good, but the fourth summer they fought at
Fyrileif; (20) then king Magnus had near sixty hundred men, but Harold had
fifteen hundred.&nbsp; These chiefs were with Harold:&nbsp; Kristred his
brother, earl Rognvald, Ingimar of Ask, Thiostolf Ali&#146;s son, and Solmund.&nbsp;
King Magnus got the victory, but king Harold fled.&nbsp; There fell Kristred
and Ingimar.&nbsp; He (Ingimar) chanted this song: ---</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends befooled me</p>

<p>To Fyrileif field,</p>

<p>Aye was I unwilling</p>

<p>For onslaught of war;</p>

<p>Me bit bolts bitter</p>

<p>From crossbow sped,</p>

<p>Ne&#146;er again shall I</p>

<p>To Ask (21) go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Harold fled east to
the Bay to his ships, and fared south to Denmark to find king Eric the
ever-memorable.&nbsp; He gave him Halland as a lordship and eight longships
without tackle.&nbsp; Thiostolf Ali&#146;s son sold his lands for ships and arms,
and went to seek king Harold south in Denmark that autumn. &nbsp;King Harold
came towards Yule to Bergen, and lay over Yule-tide in Floru-voe. (22)&nbsp;
But after Yule they run up to the town, and there was but a little
struggle;&nbsp; king Magnus was taken captive on board his ship and maimed, but
king Harold took all the land under his sway.&nbsp; But the next spring after
king Harold renewed the gift to Rognvald about the isles, and the title of earl
as well.</p>

<p>66.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kol gave this advice to send men to
the Orkneys at once after this, and (Rognvald) begged earl Paul that he would
give up half the isles as king Harold had given them to him;&nbsp; then
friendship and thorough kinship should spring up between them.&nbsp; But if
earl Paul refused these things, then these very same men should fare to find Frakok
and Oliver the unruly, and offer them half the lands with earl Rognvald, if
they would seek to get it from earl Paul with a host.&nbsp; But when these men
came to the Orkneys and saw earl Paul, and brought forward their errand there,
then earl Paul answers:&nbsp; &#8220;I understand this claim, how it is made with
mickle cunning and forethought;&nbsp; they have betaken themselves to the kings
of Norway to get the realm away from under me.&nbsp; Now I will not reward that
faithlessness by giving up my realm to those who come no nearer to me than
Rognvald, and by refusing it to my brother&#146;s son and my sister&#146;s son.&nbsp;
There is no need here of long words, for I will guard the Orkneys by the
strength of my friends and kinsfolk while God grants me life to do so.&#8221;&nbsp;
Then the messengers saw how their errand was likely to turn out there.&nbsp; So
they fared away, and went south over the Pentland firth to Caithness, and so
into Sutherland to find Frakok, and tell their errand there, how earl Rognvald
and Kol offer Oliver and Frakok half the Orkneys if they will win them back
from earl Paul.&nbsp; Frakok speaks thus:&nbsp; &#8220;True it is that Kol is a very
wise man, and wisely has it been seen to in this plan to look hither for
strength, because we kinsfolk have great strength, and many men bound to us by
ties.&nbsp; I have now given away Margaret Hacon&#146;s daughter to earl Moddan of
Athole, who is noblest of all the Scottish-chiefs by birth.&nbsp; Melmari his
father was brother of Malcolm the Scot-king, father of David, who is now the
Scot-king.&nbsp; We have also,&#8221; she said, &#8220;many true claims to the Orkneys, but
we are ourselves something of schemers, and we are said to be rather
deep-witted, so that this strife does not come upon us unawares;&nbsp; but
still it seems good to me to join fellowship with that father and son for many
things&#146; sake.&nbsp; Ye shall say these words to Kol and Rognvald that we two,
Oliver and I, will come to the Orkneys next summer at midsummer with a host to
fall on earl Paul;&nbsp; let Rognvald and his men come thither then to meet us,
and let us then fight it out with earl Paul;&nbsp; but this winter I will draw
strength to me out of Scotland and the Southern isles from my kinsfolk and
friends and connexions.&#8221;&nbsp; Now the messengers fare back east to Norway, and
tell that father and son how they had sped.</p>

<p>67.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That winter after this earl
Rognvald busked him to fare west, and these chiefs with him, Solmund and
John;&nbsp; they fared in the course of the summer after, and had picked men,
though not many;&nbsp; (and) five or six ships.&nbsp; They come off Shetland at
midsummer and heard nothing of Frakok.&nbsp; Then high and foul winds arose,
and they laid their ships up in Alasound, (23) but fared about to feasts and
free-quarters over the land and the freemen made them good cheer.&nbsp; But of
Frakok it must be told that she fares in the spring out to the Southern isles,
and she and Oliver gather force thence to themselves in men and ships;&nbsp;
they got twelve ships, and all of them small and rather thinly manned.&nbsp;
And near midsummer they held on for the Orkneys, and mean to meet earl
Rognvald, as was said;&nbsp; they were slow in getting a wind.&nbsp; There
Oliver the unruly was leader of that host, and the earldom in the Orkneys was
meant for him if they could get it.&nbsp; Frakok was there in the fleet too,
and many of her kith and kin.</p>

<p>68.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Paul was then at Westness in
Rowsay at a feast with Sigurd, when he heard that earl Rognvald was come to
Shetland;&nbsp; then too was heard how a host was gathering together in the
Southern isles to attack them.&nbsp; Then the earl sent word to Kugi in
Westray, and to Thorkell flayer, they were wise men;&nbsp; and many other
chieftains he summoned to him.&nbsp; At this meeting the earl asked counsel of
his friends, but they did not all look on the matter in one way;&nbsp; some
wished to share the realm with one or other (of the foe), and not to have both
against them, but some advised that the earl should fare over to the Ness to
his friends, and see what force he could get there.&nbsp; Earl Paul
answers:&nbsp; &#8220;I will not now offer my realm to those to whom I refused it
then right out when they sought it by fair means;&nbsp; methinks too it is
unchieftainlike to fly my land without one trial of strength;&nbsp; I will take
that counsel to send men tonight round all the isles to gather force, and let
us fare against Rognvald and his men as soon as we can, and let our quarrel come
to the sword'&#146; point ere the South-islanders come."&#8221; This plan was taken
which the earl spoke of.&nbsp; That man was then with earl Paul, whose name was
Sweyn breastrope;&nbsp; he was one of the earl&#146;s bodyguard, and well honoured
of him;&nbsp; he was ever on viking voyages in the summer, but the winters he
spent with earl Paul.&nbsp; Sweyn was a tall, strong man, swarthy and rather
unlucky-looking;&nbsp; he was very fond of the old faith, and had all his life
lain out at night (to follow his black arts).&nbsp; He was one of the earl&#146;s
forecastle men.&nbsp; These chiefs came at once that night to earl Paul;&nbsp;
Eyvind Melbrigdi&#146;s son;&nbsp; he had a longship fully manned.&nbsp; Olaf
Hrolf&#146;s son of Gairsay had another, Thorkell flayer a third, Sigurd the master
of the house there a fourth, the fifth the earl had himself.&nbsp; With these
five ships they hold on to Hrossey, and come there on the evening of the fifth
day of the week (Thursday evening) at sundown;&nbsp; then force flocked to them
during the night, but they got no more ships.&nbsp; They meant the day after to
sail to Shetland against Rognvald and his men.&nbsp; But next morning, when it
had got light, and the sun was just up, those men came to the earl, who said
they had seen longships fairing from the south on the Pentland firth;&nbsp;
they said they could not tell whether there were ten or twelve of them.&nbsp;
The earl and his men made up their minds that there must be coming Frakok&#146;s
host.&nbsp; Then the earl bade them to get ready to row against them as hard
and as fast as they could.&nbsp; Then they, Olaf and Sigurd begged him to take
time about it, and said men would come into them every hour.&nbsp; And
lo!&nbsp; as they rowed east from Tankarness, longships come sailing against
them from the east round the Mull, and they were twelve in all.&nbsp; Then the
earl and his men lashed their ships together.&nbsp; Then came to him Erling,
the master of Tankarness, and his sons, and offered him his help.&nbsp; By that
time they were so thronged on board their ships that they thought they could
find room for no more men.&nbsp; Then the earl bade Erling to bring down stones
for them while they were in no risk of attack.&nbsp; And when they had made all
clear for fight, Oliver and his side came up, and gave them an onslaught by
rowing at once, and they had far more men, but smaller ships.&nbsp; Oliver had
a great ship, and he laid that against the earl&#146;s ship.&nbsp; There was then
the hardest fight.&nbsp; Olaf Hrolf&#146;s son, laid his ship against the smaller
ships of Oliver, and there was a great difference in the height of the sides,
and in a short while he cleared the decks of three ships.&nbsp; Oliver made
such a hard onslaught on the earl&#146;s ship, that all the forecastle men gave way
and fled aft of the mast.&nbsp; Then Oliver egged on his men to board, and goes
himself the first man up.&nbsp; Sweyn breastrope was the foremost of all the
earl&#146;s men, and fought most stoutly.&nbsp; Earl Paul sees now that Oliver was
come up on board his ship, and eggs on his men fast;&nbsp; he leaps down
himself from the poop, and springs forward in the ship, and when Oliver saw
that, he snatched up a boat-hook, and hurled it at the earl, and it fell upon
his shield, and down he fell at once on the planks.&nbsp; Then there was a
great shout.&nbsp; And at that moment Sweyn breastrope snatched up a great
stone and hurled it at Oliver, and hit him full in the breast;&nbsp; the blow was
so great that he tumbled at once overboard, and sank in the sea.&nbsp; His men
got hold of him, and then he was drawn up into his ship, and he lay there
senseless, and men knew not whether he were dead or alive.&nbsp; Then some ran
and hewed the lashings asunder, and were for flying, and then all Oliver&#146;s men
were driven down from the earl&#146;s ship.&nbsp; Then they took to flying.&nbsp;
Just then Oliver came to himself, and bade them not to fly;&nbsp; but then no
one made as though he knew what he said:&nbsp; The earl chased the flying ships
east of Hrossey, and so farther east of Hrossey and Rognvaldsey, and so into
the Pentland firth;&nbsp; then they drew away from one another.&nbsp; Then the
earl turns back, and where they had fought five ships of Oliver&#146;s fleet lay
empty and unmanned.&nbsp; The earl took them for his own, and manned them with
his followers.&nbsp; The fight took place on the Fastday (Friday), but that
night the earl made them put their ships into trim.&nbsp; Then many men
gathered to him, and two longships.&nbsp; Next morning he had twelve ships, and
all in good trim and well manned.&nbsp; Saturday he sailed to Shetland, and
came by night into Alasound unawares to those who watched earl Rognvald&#146;s
ships;&nbsp; then earl Paul made them slay the men, but took the ships and the
goods to himself.&nbsp; But next morning news came to Rognvald and his
men;&nbsp; they rushed together and had a great gathering of the freemen;&nbsp;
after that they fared down to the strand, and then egg on Paul and his men to
come on shore and fight with them.&nbsp; But earl Paul put no trust in the
Shetlanders, and therefore would not go on land, but offered that they should
get them ships and fight it out on shipboard.&nbsp; But Rognvald and his men
saw that they could get no ships in which they could fight on fair terms.&nbsp;
And so they parted as things stood.&nbsp; Earl Paul and his men fared back to
the Orkneys, but earl Rognvald and his men were in Shetland all that summer,
but at autumn they got carried in ships to Norway by divers chapmen, and their
voyage was thought rather shameful.&nbsp; But when earl Rognvald came home, and
he and his father met, Kol asks whether Rognvald was ill content with his
lot.&nbsp; He says he thinks very little had come of his errand, and that
little rather unworthily.&nbsp; Kol says:&nbsp; &#8220;I do not think so
though;&nbsp; methinks the errand has been good, and that much has been done if
the Shetlanders are your friends, and that it is better to have gone than not
to have gone.&#8221;&nbsp; Rognvald says:&nbsp; &#8220;If thou praisest this voyage, then
it must either be that thou must care less about our lot than I thought, or
thou must see something in our voyage which we have not yet thought of
seeing.&nbsp; I should be very glad now that thou shouldest lay down a plan for
us and be thyself on the voyage with us.&#8221;&nbsp; Kol says:&nbsp; &#8220;Both of these
things now shall not be done;&nbsp; say all your work is easy, but come one
self&#146;s never near the spot.&nbsp; I shall be very glad to use my counsel so as
not to swerve from your honour.&#8221;&nbsp; Rognvald answers:&nbsp; &#8220;We will
willingly follow the advice thou givest.&#8221;&nbsp; Kol says:&nbsp; &#8220;My first
advice is that thou sendest word to king Harold and other of thy friends that
they get thee force and ships for a western voyage early in the spring, but we
will draw to us all the strength we can get this winter, and let us so lay our
plans this second time that one of two things may be, either that we get the
Orkneys, or else lay our bones there.&#8221;&nbsp; Rognvald answers:&nbsp; &#8220;The
thought dwells in my mind not to fare on many more such voyages as this which
we have now fared;&nbsp; and such, I ween, is the thought of most of those who
lately fared with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>69.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Paul fared to the Orkneys after
that he had taken the ships of earl Rognvald and his men;&nbsp; he had then to
boast over a great victory.&nbsp; Then he had a great feast and bade to him his
chieftains.&nbsp; There then was taken that counsel to pile up (24) a beacon in
the Fair Isle;&nbsp; fire was to be put to it if a host were seen sailing from
Shetland.&nbsp; Then there was another on Rinansey (North Ronaldsay), and so on
in more of the isles, so that it might be seen all over the isles if war were
coming on them.&nbsp; Then too men were set to call out men round all the
islands;&nbsp; Thorstein Havard&#146;s son, Gunni&#146;s son, was to have Rinansey, but
his brother Magnus was to have Sanday, Kugi (was to be on the watch) round
Westray, Sigurd of Westness on Rowsay, Olaf Hrolf&#146;s son fared to Duncansby in
Caithness, and had the wardship there.&nbsp; His son Waltheof dwelt then in
Stronsay.&nbsp; Then earl Paul granted gifts to his friends, and all promised
him their thorough friendship.&nbsp; He kept many men about him that autumn,
until he learned that Rognvald and his men were away from Shetland. &nbsp;Then
no tidings happened in the islands, and so it went on up to Yule.&nbsp; Earl
Paul had a great Yule-feast, and made ready for it at that homestead of his
which is called Orfir;&nbsp; he bade thither many noble men.&nbsp; Thither was
bidden Waltheof Olaf&#146;s son out of Stronsay. (25)&nbsp; They set off ten of them
in a ten-oared boat, and they were all lost in the West-firth the day before
Yule, and that was thought great tidings, for Waltheof one of the best-bred of
men.&nbsp; His father Olaf had a great train of followers in Caithness;&nbsp;
there were his sons Sweyn and Gunni, and the sons of Grim of Swanay, Asbjorn
and Margad, but Asleif the mistress of the house and her son Gunni had gone to
a feast at a friend&#146;s house no long way off.&nbsp; These tidings happened at
Duncansby three nights before Yule that Sweyn Olaf&#146;s son had rowed out to fish,
and those brothers Asbjorn and Margad with him.&nbsp; They always went about
with him, and were the briskest and bravest of men.&nbsp; But in the night
after they had gone away came Oliver the unruly to Duncansby with that train
which had followed him on his viking voyage that summer, and seized the house
over Olaf&#146;s head and set fire to it at once, and burned him inside it and six
men with him, but allowed the others in the house to go out.&nbsp; They took
there all the chattels and goods, and went away after they had done that
deed.&nbsp; Sweyn, who was afterwards called Asleif&#146;s son, came home before the
first day of Yule, and fared at once north on the Pentland firth;&nbsp; he came
about midnight to Swanay to the house of Grim, the father of Asbjorn and his
brother.&nbsp; Grim got into a ship with them, and they put Sweyn across to
Knarstead on Scapa-neck.&nbsp; Arnkell was the name of the man who kept house
there, and his sons&#146; names were Hanef and Sigurd.&nbsp; Grim and his sons
turned back thence, and Sweyn gave Grim a gold finger-ring.&nbsp; Hanef and his
brother Sigurd brought Sweyn to Orfir;&nbsp; there he had a hearty
welcome;&nbsp; men guided him to Eyvind Melbrigdi&#146;s son, Sweyn&#146;s kinsman.&nbsp;
Eyvind led Sweyn before earl Paul, and the earl greeted Sweyn well and asked
him what news, but Sweyn tells the death of his father, with all that had
happened.&nbsp; The earl was ill pleased at that, and said that he had suffered
a great loss;&nbsp; he asked Sweyn to be with him, and said that he would do
him great honour.&nbsp; Sweyn thanks the earl kindly for his bidding, and said
he would willingly accept it.</p>

<p>70.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that men went to
even-song.&nbsp; There was a great homestead there, and it stood on the side of
a slope, and there was a steep hill at the back of the house, and when one came
on to the brow of the hill, Orrida-firth lay down below.&nbsp; In it lies
Damsay.&nbsp; There was a castle in the island, and that man guarded it whose
name was Blann, a son of Thorstein of Flidruness.&nbsp; There in Orfir was a
great drinking hall, and there was a door at the east gable from the south in
the side wall, and a noble church stood before the hall door, and one went down
steps from the hall into the church.&nbsp; But as one went into the hall, there
was on the left hand a great flat stone, and further on inside ale-casks, both
many and great, but when one passed through the doorway there was a small room
facing one. (26)&nbsp; When men were come from even-song, they were ranged in
seats.&nbsp; The earl made Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son sit next to him on the inside,
but on the outside of the earl Sweyn breastrope sat next him, and then John the
kinsman of Sweyn breastrope.&nbsp; When the board was cleared those men came
who told of the drowning of Waltheof Olaf&#146;s son;&nbsp; and the earl thought
that great news.&nbsp; Then the earl bade that no one should tease Sweyn
Asleif&#146;s son while Yule lasted, and said that even then he would have enough to
think on.&nbsp; And at even, when men had drunk, the earl and most men with him
went to sleep.&nbsp; But Sweyn breastrope went out, and sat out all night, in
heathen rites, as was his wont.&nbsp; And during the night men rose and went to
church and heard prayers, and after high mass men sat down at the board.&nbsp;
Eyvind Melbrigdi&#146;s son had most of the management of the feast with the earl,
and did not sit down himself.&nbsp; The waiting-men and torch-bearers stood
before the earl&#146;s table, but Eyvind poured out the drink into the cup of each
of those namesakes.&nbsp; Then Sweyn breastrope thought that Eyvind filled his
cup higher, and would not touch it before Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son had drunk off his
cup, and said Sweyn (Asleif&#146;s son) drank unfairly.&nbsp; There had long been no
love lost between Sweyn breastrope and Olaf Hrolf&#146;s son, and so too between
those namesakes since Swein Asleif&#146;s son grew up to be a man.&nbsp; And when
drinking had gone on a while, then they went to Nones.&nbsp; But when men came
in again, then healths and memories were solemnly spoken of, and horns were
drained.&nbsp; Then Sweyn breastrope would change horns with his namesake, and
said he thought it was a little one. &nbsp;Then Eyvind thrust a great horn into
Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son&#146;s hand, and he offered that to his namesake.&nbsp; Then
Sweyn breastrope got wrath, and said to himself between his lips, so that some
men, and the earl among the rest, heard him:&nbsp; &#8220;Sweyn will be Sweyn&#146;s
death, and Sweyn shall be Sweyn&#146;s death.&#8221;&nbsp; This was hushed up at once, and
now the drinking went on up to even-song.&nbsp; And when the earl went out,
then Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son went before him, but Sweyn breastrope sat behind and
drank.&nbsp; But when they came out into the ale-room, Eyvind came after them,
and led Sweyn aside to talk.&nbsp; &#8220;Heardest thou,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what thy
namesake said when thou hadst offered him the horn?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;No,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;
Then Eyvind repeated the words, and said that the fiend must have put those
words into his mouth during the night.&nbsp; &#8220;He must mean thee death, but thou
shalt be beforehand with him in the deed, and slay him."&#8221; Eyvind put an
axe into his hand, and bade him stand by the flat stone in the shade, and told
him to give Sweyn the blow in front if John went before him, but if John went
behind, then he bade Sweyn to deal his namesake the blow behind.&nbsp; The earl
went to church, and no one gave heed to Eyvind and Sweyn.&nbsp; But Sweyn breastrope
and John went out a little later than the earl.&nbsp; Sweyn breastrope had a
sword in his hand, for he always bore his sword, though others were weaponless,
and John went first.&nbsp; It was light up to the doorway, but the weather was
thick.&nbsp; And when Sweyn breastrope came to the doorway, Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son
smote him in front on the forehead, and he stumbled forward at the blow, but
did not fall.&nbsp; And when he stood straight again, then he saw a man
standing at the door, and thought it must be he that had wounded him.&nbsp; Then
he drew his sword, and dealt him a blow with it on the head, and clave him down
to the shoulders;&nbsp; but it was his kinsman John on whom the blow fell, and
there they both fell down.&nbsp; Then Eyvind came up and led Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son
into that room which was over against the doorway, and he was there drawn out
at a window-slit. (27)&nbsp; There Magnus Eyvind&#146;s son has a horse ready
saddled, and guided him away at the back of the homestead, and so to
Orrida-firth.&nbsp; Then they took ship, and Magnus carried Sweyn to Damsay,
and brought him to the castle;&nbsp; but Blann carried him next morning north
to Egil&#146;s isle to meet bishop William.&nbsp; The bishop was then at prayers
when they came thither.&nbsp; And after mass Sweyn was brought by stealth to
the bishop, and Sweyn tells him the tidings, the death of his father Olaf and
of Waltheof, and the slaying of Sweyn and John, and called on the bishop to
shelter him.&nbsp; The bishop thanked him for the slaying of Sweyn breastrope,
and said that had been a cleansing of the land.&nbsp; The bishop let Sweyn stay
there till Yule was over;&nbsp; but after that he sent him into the Southern
isles to Tyree, to that man whose name was Holdbodi, and who was Hundi&#146;s
son;&nbsp; he was a great chief there, and gave Sweyn a very hearty
welcome.&nbsp; He stayed there that winter, and was thought of much worth by
all the people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>71.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little while after those manslayings had taken
place in Orfir men ran up from the church, and Sweyn was borne inside the
house, for he had not yet drawn his last breath, though he had lost his
senses.&nbsp; He died in the course of the night.&nbsp; Then the earl made
every man take his seat, and wanted to be sure who it was that had caused the
slayings;&nbsp; and then Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son was missing.&nbsp; Then men thought
it clear that Sweyn had slain them.&nbsp; Then Eyvind came up and said:&nbsp;
&#8220;Any man can see that Sweyn breastrope must have given John his death.&#8221;&nbsp;
The earl said that no man should blow a hair off Sweyn&#146;s (1) head, and says he
would not have done this without a cause.&nbsp; &#8220;But if he takes himself off
from meeting me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;then he will be doing himself an ill turn by that.&#8221;
(2)&nbsp; Men thought it most likely that Sweyn&nbsp; would have gone to Paplay
to Hacon churl, brother of earl Magnus the saint;&nbsp; he was a great chief,
mild and gentle.&nbsp; The earl heard no news of Sweyn that winter, and made
them make him an outlaw.&nbsp; When the spring began the earl fared far and
near about the north isles to get in his rents.&nbsp; He made great friends
with the great men, and gave away almost with both hands.&nbsp; The earl came
into Stronsay, and gave Thorkell flayer that farm which Waltheof Olaf&#146;s son had
owned, for the sake of knowing where Sweyn had settled down.&nbsp; Thorkell
spoke and said:&nbsp; &#8220;It does not turn out now as the saying goes, &#145;Many are a
king&#146;s ears.&#146;&nbsp; But though thou beest earl, still it seems to me wonderful
that though hast heard no tidings of Sweyn, for I knew at once that bishop
William sent him to the Southern isles to Holdbodi Hundi&#146;s son, and there he
has been this winter.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl said:&nbsp; &#8220;What shall I do to the
bishop who has dared to do this?&#8221;&nbsp; Thorkell answers:&nbsp; &#8220;No blame must
be given to the bishop for this in the face of what now lies at the door;&nbsp;
thou wilt need all thy friends if Rognvald and his men come from the
east.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl says, &#8220;that what he says is true.&#8221;&nbsp; Earl Paul fared
thence to Rinansey (North Ronaldsay), and accepted feast at mistress Ragna&#146;s
house and Thorstein&#146;s her son.&nbsp; Ragna was a wise woman.&nbsp; They had
another farm in Papay. (3)&nbsp; The earl sat there three nights, for he could
not get a wind to Kugi&#146;s house in Westray.&nbsp; They, Ragna and the earl,
talked much, and she says to the earl that he had little loss in Sweyn
breastrope, even though he was a great warrior.&nbsp; &#8220;Thou gottest from him
many feuds;&nbsp; it were my counsel, in the face of that trouble which stares
you in the face, that ye make you as many friends as you can, and not be
fault-finding.&nbsp; I would too that ye laid no blame on bishop William or the
other kinsmen of Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son;&nbsp; but I would rather that thou
wouldest forgive the bishop thy wrath, and this besides, that thou wouldest let
word be sent to the Southern isles for Sweyn, and forgive him thy wrath too,
and give him back his estates on condition that he will be to thee such a man
as his father was.&nbsp; It has always been the custom of the noblest men to do
much for the sake of their friends, and so to gather to themselves force and
friendship."&nbsp; The earl answers: &nbsp;&#8220;Thou art a wise wife, Ragna,
but still thou has not yet gotten the title of earl in the Orkneys;&nbsp; thou
shalt not rule the land here.&nbsp; A pretty thing indeed that I should give
Sweyn goods for an atonement, and think that I should win victory for my side in
that way!&#8221;&nbsp; He gets wrath about this, and said:&nbsp; &#8220;God settle matters
between my kinsman earl Rognvald and me, and let things so go as each has
deserved by his deeds.&nbsp; If I have misdone towards him, then it is time
that I should atone for it;&nbsp; but if so be his aim is to get my realm, then
methinks that man my best friend who aids me, that I may be able to hold my
realm.&nbsp; Rognvald I have never yet seen;&nbsp; and this is why, so far as
my knowledge goes, I have all the less done him any wrong, because whatever our
kinsfolk may have caused to be done, men know well enough that I had no share
in those things.&#8221;&nbsp; Many answered that it was quite unpardonabl for any one
to try and strive with him for the realm, but no one spoke against him.&nbsp;
When the spring began to wear away, earl Paul made them pile up the beacons in
the Fair Isle and Rinansey, and in almost all the isles, so that each might be
seen from the other.&nbsp; There was a man named Dagfinn Hlodver&#146;s son, who
kept house on the Fair Isle, a brisk stirring man;&nbsp; he was to watch that
beacon and set fire to it if a host were seen faring from Shetland.</p>

<p>Earl Rognvald sat that winter at home in Agdir on the farms of that father
and son, and sent word to his friends and kinsfolk;&nbsp; but some he went to
see, and begged that they would aid him in his voyage west both in men and
ships, and most of them turned a willing ear to his wants.&nbsp; But about
February Kol sent two ships of burden out of the land, one west to England to
buy stores and weapons, but in the other Solmund sailed south to Denmark to buy
there what Kol bade him, for he has now all the business of fitting them out in
his hands.&nbsp; It was so meant that these ships of burden should come back to
Norway at Easter, but they mean to set sail on the voyage after Easter week.&nbsp;
So it was done, and they held on from the east after Easter week.&nbsp; Each of
that pair, father and son, had his own long-ship, but Solmund had the
third.&nbsp; Kol and his son had besides a ship of burden laden with
stores.&nbsp; But when they came to Bergen, they found king Harold there;&nbsp;
he gave Rognvald a long-ship fully trimmed and manned.&nbsp; John limp-leg had
also a long-ship.&nbsp; The sixth Aslak, son of Erlend of Hern had;&nbsp; he
was a daughter&#146;s son of Steigar-Thorir.&nbsp; He too had a ship of burden laden
with stores.&nbsp; They had six large ships, five cutters, and three ships of
burden.&nbsp; When they lay waiting for a wind at Hern, a ship ran in from the
west, and they heard news from the Orkneys and Shetland, and what preparations
earl Paul was taking, if earl Rognvald came thither west with a host that
summer.</p>

<p>72.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Rognvald let them blow the trumpets to call
together a house-Thing (4) while they lay in Hern, (5) and spoke then of earl
Paul&#146;s preparations, and how great feud the Orkneyingers showed towards him
when they meant to keep him from the inheritance of his kinsfolk, after the
kings of Norway had given it to him as the rightful heir.&nbsp; And so he makes
them a long and clever speech, --- I meant, he said, &#8220;so to go to the Orkneys
as either to get them or else die.&#8221;&nbsp; Men gave him great praise for his
speech, and promised him trustier following.&nbsp; Then Kol stood up and
said:&nbsp; &#8220;We have heard from the Orkneys how all men there will rise up
against you, and keep you from your realm, siding with earl Paul;&nbsp; and be
sure, kinsman, that they will be slow to lay down that feud which they have
taken up against you.&nbsp; Now, it is my counsel to look for trust thither
where there is enough of it and to spare, that he may give you your realm who
owns it by right;&nbsp; but that is the saint earl Magnus, your mother&#146;s
brother.&nbsp; My wish is that though vowest to him, if he will grant thee the
inheritance of thy kindred and make thee his heir, that thou wilt let a stone
minster be built in the Orkneys at Kirkwall if thou canst get that realm, so
that there shall not be another as splendid in that land, and let it be
hallowed in the name of Saint Magnus the earl thy kinsman, and that thou wilt
lay out money, so that the church may grow and thrive, and that thither may
come his halidom, together with the bishop&#146;s seat.&#8221;&nbsp; This all thought good
advice.&nbsp; And that vow was fast made.&nbsp; After that they put to sea, and
they got a fair wind, and made Shetland, and each were glad at meeting the
others.&nbsp; The Shetlanders were able to tell them many tidings from the
Orkneys, and so they stayed there some time.</p>

<p>73.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It chanced once that Kol asks Uni, for he was then
there, and had changed his abode to that of Kol and his son, after he had taken
part in the plot against Brynjulf.&nbsp; Then Kol asks:&nbsp; &#8220;Whether of the
twain wilt thou, Uni, give counsel how the beacon in the Fair Isle may be set
on fire for naught, or undertake that work that another beacon may not be
lighted.&nbsp; I speak to thee about this because I know that thou art wiser
than most of the others who are now here, though we have here many men of
worth.&#8221;&nbsp; Uni answers:&nbsp; &#8220;I am no man for advice, but still less would
I make a rush to war by my plans.&nbsp; I will therefore rather choose what
shall be done last, because I mean to take the doing of it all on myself.&#8221;
(6)&nbsp; And a little after, one day when the weather was fair, Kol made them
fit out many small ships, and turned his course towards the Orkneys.&nbsp;
There were no chiefs on board the ships but Kol.&nbsp; And when they come so
far that they think their fleet might be seen from the Fair Isle, then Kol made
them hoist the sails on all the ships, and set men to back water with the oars,
so that the ships might move as slowly as possible, though the wind was right
aft;&nbsp; and he made them set the sails no higher than half-mast, and so
hoist them higher and higher up as they had gone further on.&nbsp; Kol says
that then their fleet would be seen from the Fair Isle, &#8220;[and it would seem] as
though the ships were coming near to the isle. (7)&nbsp; May be then that they
will set fire to the beacon, and there will be a rush to arms all over the
islands.&#8221;&nbsp; Then Dagfinn of the Fair Isle saw the ships sailing and he set
fire to the beacon at once, but fared himself to the earl and told him the
news.&nbsp; And as soon as ever the beacon was seen on the Fair Isle, then
Thorstein Ragna&#146;s son made them kindle the beacon on Rinansey.&nbsp; And after
that all the others were lit one after the other over all the isles.&nbsp; But
all the freemen fared to meet the earl, and that was the greatest war-gathering.&nbsp;
But when Kol saw that the beacon was a-blaze, he bade his men fare back;&nbsp;
and said it might so happen that this would be a cause of quarrel to some of
them;&nbsp; Kol fares back to Shetland after he had done thus much, and says
that now Uni shall betake himself to his plans.&nbsp; Uni calls three
Shetlanders to go along with him;&nbsp; they take a six-oared boat and a few
stores beside and fishing-tackle.&nbsp; They fared to the Fair Isle, and Uni
said he was a Norseman, but gives out that he had wedded in Shetland and had
sons there;&nbsp; he says too he had been robbed by earl Rognvald&#146;s men, and
speaks the hardest things of them.&nbsp; He takes up his abode in a house
there, and his sons row out to fish;&nbsp; but he stays at home to watch their
stores and catch.&nbsp; He gets to speaking with and to knowing those men who
take the lead there, and they are well pleased with him.</p>

<p>74.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that Dagfinn had set
fire to the beacon, he set off to find earl Paul, as was before said, and
thither came all the earl&#146;s chieftains.&nbsp; Then they took to asking every
one about the doings of earl Rognvald and his men;&nbsp; and men thought it
wonderful when they showed themselves nowhere.&nbsp; But still they kept the
force together three days.&nbsp; Then the freemen began to take it ill, and say
that it was great folly to burn the beacons, though fishermen were seen sailing
in their boats.&nbsp; Then blame was laid on Thorstein Ragna&#146;s son that he had
done a bad thing when he kindled the beacon on Rinansey.&nbsp; Thorstein
answers, and says he could do nothing else than fire the beacon, when he saw
the blaze on the Fair Isle, and said this had been all Dagfinn&#146;s doing.&nbsp;
Dagfinn answers:&nbsp; &#8220;Men far more often get ill from thee than though art
able to say the same of me.&#8221;&nbsp; Thorstein bade him hold his tongue, and
sprang up to him with an axe, and smote him there and then his
death-blow.&nbsp; Then men sprang to arms and a battle arose.&nbsp; This was in
Hrossey, a little way from Kirkwall.&nbsp; Sigurd of Westness and his sons
Hacon pike and Brynjulf aided Hlodver Dagfinn'&#146; father, but his own kin helped Thorstein.&nbsp;
Then this was told the earl, and he came up, but it was long ere he could get
them parted.&nbsp; Then Kugi of Westray speaks a long speech, and says
thus:&nbsp; "Do not do the earl this shame, that ye fall to blows among
yourselves, for ye will need all your men within a little time.&nbsp; Let us
take heed then that we be not unhandy or quarrelsome.&nbsp; But as for this, it
must have come about by the will and plan of our foes, and it must have been a
trick of theirs to waste the beacons thus.&nbsp; But now they may be looked for
to come every day, and so let us take counsel and make our plans.&nbsp; No
ill-will could have driven Dagfinn to do as he did, but he was a little more
hasty than he ought to have been.&#8221;&nbsp; This guess of Kugi was the very truth,
and so he went on with many wise words.&nbsp; So it came about that each side
was willing that the earl should settle the matter;&nbsp; but still it was
thought best to break up the gathering, and men went home.&nbsp; But that man
was set to watch the beacon in the Fair Isle whose name was Eric.&nbsp; And
when Uni had been a little while in the Fair Isle, he came to Eric and
said:&nbsp; &#8220;Wilt thou that I watch the beacon? since I do naught else, and I
may well sit and spend all my time on it.&#8221;&nbsp; Eric accepted that.&nbsp; But
as soon as ever no men were near to the spot, Uni threw water on the beacon,
and made it so wet that fire had no hold of it anywhere.</p>

<p>75.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Rognvald and his men
agreed that they would wait until the spring tides and east wind set in
together, for then it is scarcely possible to pass between Westray and Hrossey,
but with an east wind one may sail from Shetland to Westray.&nbsp; And so earl
Rognvald and his men profited by this, and came on Friday evening to Westray
into Hofn, to the house of Helgi, who lived there.&nbsp; No signs were then given
by the beacons, for when the sails were seen from the Fair Isle, Eric busked
him to go to earl, and sent men to Uni to bid him fire the beacon, but when
that man came thither, Uni was off and away.&nbsp; And when that man wanted to
fire the beacon, then it was so wet that the fire would not catch it.&nbsp; And
when Eric hears this, he thinks he sees how things have gone.&nbsp; After that
he fares to find earl Paul, and tells him.&nbsp; But when earl Rognvald was
come into Westray, all the island blades gathered together, and they, Kugi and
Helgi, take counsel for them.&nbsp; The first thing was to seek for peace from
the earl.&nbsp; And the end of this business was that the Westrayingers come
under earl Rognvald&#146;s power, and swear oaths to him.</p>

<p>76.&nbsp; On the Sunday after earl Rognvald heard mass there in the thorpe,
and they were standing outside by the church.&nbsp; Then they saw how sixteen
men walked without weapons and bald.&nbsp; Them they thought wonderously
boun.&nbsp; The earl&#146;s men talked together, and asked who these men might
be.&nbsp; Then the earl sang a song:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen have I seen at once---</p>

<p>Topknots fell about their brows,</p>

<p>Shield or weapon bore they none, ---</p>

<p>Women all together walk;</p>

<p>We bore witness now to this,</p>

<p>That here west are far the most</p>

<p>Shaveling maidens in this isle,</p>

<p>In the main it lies in tempests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Sunday was over
earl Rognvald&#146;s men fared there about the country round, and all men came under
the earl&#146;s power.&nbsp; It fell out one night in Westray that the earl&#146;s men
had news that the islanders were to have a secret meeting to plot against earl
Rognvald.&nbsp; But when the earl got news of that, then he arose and went to
the meeting.&nbsp; But it happened that the earl&#146;s men had beaten many of the
island blades, and taken master Kugi and put him in fetters, and said he was at
the bottom of this plot.&nbsp; But when earl Rognvald came to the meeting Kugi
fell at his feet and laid all his cause in God&#146;s hand and the earl&#146;s;&nbsp; he
said he had been brought to the meeting against his will, for all the freemen wished
him to be foreman in the plot.&nbsp; Kugi pleaded his own cause well and
glibly, and many others pleaded with him, and tried to prove what he said to be
true.&nbsp; Then the earl chanted this: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Crooked fetters I see lying</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the legs of greybeard Kugi,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kugi, worst of midnight plotters,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fetters now forbid thy straying!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kugi!&nbsp; never hold again</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Midnight tryst nor bargain break,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thou shalt be shut out from guile,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take an oath and keep it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earl gave all the men
there peace.&nbsp; Then they bound their fellowship anew [with oaths].</p>

<p>77.&nbsp; When earl Rognvald had come into the Orkneys and many men had come
under his power, Paul was in Hrossey, and he and his friends held a Thing and
took counsel with their men.&nbsp; The earl asked for advice as to how he
should behave in this strait.&nbsp; But men handled it in various ways, and it
was counsel of some that the lands should be shared with earl Rognvald;&nbsp;
but most of the mighty men, and the freemen too, wished to buy earl Rognvald
off with money, and offered there and then help to do it.&nbsp; Some were eager
to have a fight for it, and said that had turned out well before.&nbsp; Earl
Rognvald had had spies at the meeting, and when they come to him, the earl
asked the news.&nbsp; A skald who had been at the Thing answered the earl: (8)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Mighty chief!&nbsp; I hear that our</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Foemen hide a hostile mind,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the freemen at the meeting</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This report I also heard,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That the feeders of the wolf,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many masters too of ships,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wished thy ships to keep the sea,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But for Paul to hold the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that earl Rognvald
sent men to find the bishop and begged him to become a daysman (9) between
them, and (he) sent for Thorstein Ragna&#146;s son, and Thorstein Havard&#146;s son out
of Sanday, and bade them to go with him and try to make a settlement and to
stand by neither side in making any strife;&nbsp; and when they came to the
bishop they fared altogether to find earl Paul, and he (the bishop) tried to
make a settlement between those kinsmen.&nbsp; The bishop brought this about,
that peace was fixed for half a month, that they might try to make a more
lasting settlement.&nbsp; Then the isles were shared into lots, where either
earl should have his living during that time.&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald fared to
Hrossey, but earl Paul fared to Rowsay.&nbsp; And in that time these tidings
happened in the isles, that those kinsmen of Swein Asleif&#146;s son, John wing of
the Upland in Hoy, and Richard of the Brink in Stronsay, fared against Thorkell
flayer to that farm which Waltheof had owned, and burned him inside it, and
nine men with him.&nbsp; They fared after that to find earl Rognvald, and gave
him that choice, that they would join earl Paul with all their kin if earl
Rognvald would not take to them.&nbsp; The earl did not turn them away from
him.&nbsp; And when Haflidi Thorkell&#146;s son heard that, he fared at once to find
earl Paul, as soon as he heard of his father&#146;s burning, and earl Paul took to
him.&nbsp; After that John and his kinsfolk bound themselves as earl Rognvald&#146;s
liegemen.&nbsp; He soon had a great following there in the isles, and was much
beloved.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald gave John and Solmund and Aslak and many other of
his helpers leave to go home;&nbsp; but they wished to stay and see how things
would turn out.&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald said:&nbsp; &#8220;My thought is, if God
wills that I should get rule in the Orkneys, that he will give me strength, and
so will the saint earl Magnus, my kinsman, to hold it, even though ye fare home
to your estates.&#8221;&nbsp; After that they fared home to Norway, each of them to
his own abode.</p>

<p>78.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That spring early Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son had fared away
from the Southern isles up into Scotland to see his friends.&nbsp; He stayed a
long time in Athole with earl Moddad and Margaret Hacon&#146;s daughter, and they
talked about many things in secret.&nbsp; There Sweyn heard of strife from the
Orkneys, and he grew eager to fare thither and find his kinsfolk.&nbsp; He
fared first to Caithness to Thurso, and a noble man with him whose name was
Ljotolf;&nbsp; with him Sweyn had been long that spring.&nbsp; They came to
earl Ottar&#146;s house in Thurso, Frakok&#146;s brother, and Ljotolf tried to bring
about a settlement between Ottar and Sweyn for what Frakok had caused to be done,
and earl Ottar paid down the fines for the atonement on his own behalf.&nbsp;
The earl also gave his word that he would be friends with Sweyn, but Sweyn
promised earl Ottar to strengthen Erlend the son of Harold smooth-tongue, so
that he might get back his father&#146;s inheritance in the Orkneys when he laid
claim to it.&nbsp; Sweyn there changed ships, and had a ship of burden thence,
and thirty men on board her.&nbsp; Thence he took a northwest wind across the
Pentland firth, and so west of Hrossey, and so to Evie sound, and so up the
sound to Rowsay.&nbsp; At the isle&#146;s end was a high headland, and a great heap
of stones under it beneath;&nbsp; and there otters often lay among the
rocks.&nbsp; And as Sweyn and his men were rowing along the sound, he began to
speak, and said:&nbsp; &#8220;There are men yonder on the headland, and we will run
in thither and learn the news of them.&nbsp; My will now is that men should
change their trim a little;&nbsp; we will take to our hammocks;&nbsp; and there
twenty men shall lie down, but ten shall row; (10) we will go softly and
slowly.&#8221;&nbsp; But when they neared the isle, men call out from the head that
they must row to Westness, and bring to earl Paul what they had on board
ship.&nbsp; They thought they were speaking to chapmen.&nbsp; But earl Paul had
been that night at Westness to a feast in Sigurd&#146;s house.&nbsp; The earl had
risen up betimes, and he and nineteen men had gone south on the isle to hunt
otters which lay among the rocks under the head.&nbsp; They meant to be back
home in time for their morning draught.&nbsp; The men on board the ship of burden
rowed to land, and they asked one another of this thing and that, and what the
men were called whom they had met.&nbsp; The men in the ship of burden told
whence they had come;&nbsp; they ask also where the earl might be.&nbsp; They
tell them that he was there on the rocks.&nbsp; Sweyn and his men heard that as
they lay in their hammocks;&nbsp; and Sweyn then told them to run the ship in
so that she might not be seen from the head.&nbsp; Then Sweyn said that they
must arm themselves, and fall at once on the earl&#146;s men when they met.&nbsp;
And so they do.&nbsp; There they slew nineteen men, but six of Sweyn&#146;s men
fell.&nbsp; They took earl Paul by force, and led him on board their ship, and
turned their stem to the sea, and fared back the same way west of Hrossey, and
ran in between Hoy and Grimsey, and so east of Swelg, (11) thence south to
Broad firth, and up it to Ekkjalsbakka. (12)&nbsp; There he left his ship and
twenty men, but he and the rest fared till he came to Athole and met earl
Maddad and Margaret earl Paul&#146;s sister.&nbsp; There they had a hearty welcome,
and earl Maddad set earl Paul in his own high-seat.&nbsp; And when they had sat
down, in came Margaret walking with a great train of women, and threw her arms
round her brother.&nbsp; After that men were brought in to amuse them.&nbsp;
Earl Paul was rather short of words, as was not wonderful that he should have
great misgivings.&nbsp; Nothing has been handed down of earl Paul&#146;s words, or
of Sweyn&#146;s as they were faring both together.&nbsp; Earl Maddad and Margaret
and Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son went into a room and talked together.&nbsp; But at even
after drink Sweyn and his captive were shown the way to a sleeping-house all
alone, and they were locked in there, and so it went on every evening while
they were there.</p>

<p>79.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened one day that Margaret gave out that Sweyn
Asleif&#146;s son was going to the Orkneys to see earl Rognvald, and give him his
choice whether he would rather have earl Paul to rule with him in the Orkneys,
or Harold, son of Maddad and herself, who was three winters old.&nbsp; And when
earl Paul heard of that, he answers:&nbsp; &#8220;As to my mind, it is to be said
that I fared away so from my realm that men will never have heard of such
doings before:&nbsp; nor will I ever go back to the Orkneys.&nbsp; I see that
this vengeance must be given of God for the robbery of me and my kinsmen;&nbsp;
but if it seems to God that the realm is mine, then will I give it to Harold,
if he may live to enjoy it;&nbsp; but as for me, I wish that money may be given
me to settle me in some cloister, and then keep ye watch and ward, so that I do
not get away thence.&nbsp; But my wish is, Sweyn, that thou farest to the
Orkneys, and sayest that I am blinded, or even more maimed, for my friends will
seek me out if I am sound and hale in all my limbs.&nbsp; It may then be that I
may not be able to forego faring back to my realm with them, for I guess they
will think there is more harm in our parting than will really befall
them.&#8221;&nbsp; No more words of the earl are handed down than these.&nbsp; After
that Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son fared to the Orkneys, but earl Paul stayed behind in
Scotland.&nbsp; And this is the story that Sweyn told of what had
happened.&nbsp; But some men tell a story which is less seemly, that Margaret
had led Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son by her counsel to blind earl Paul her brother, and
put him into a dark dungeon;&nbsp; but after that she got another man to take
his life there.&nbsp; But we do not know which of the two stories is more
true;&nbsp; but all men know that he never afterwards came back to the Orkneys,
nor held he any rule in Scotland.</p>

<p>80.&nbsp;&nbsp; These tidings happened at Westness, when the earl&#146;s
home-coming grew late, then Sigurd, the master of the house, made them send men
to look for them;&nbsp; but when they got to where the pile of rocks was, they
saw the bodies of the slain.&nbsp; Then they thought the earl must have fallen
there;&nbsp; fared home and told these tidings.&nbsp; Sigurd fared at once to
the spot to see and reckon the dead, and they found there nineteen of the
earl&#146;s men, but there were six men besides there whom they knew not.&nbsp;
After that Sigurd sent men to Egil&#146;s isle to find the bishop and to tell him
these tidings.&nbsp; And the bishop fared at once to see Sigurd, and they fell
to talk of these tidings, and Sigurd guessed that this must have been by the
plotting of earl Rognvald.&nbsp; But the bishop answers that some other proof
must be brought forward before he would believe that earl Rognvald had betrayed
earl Paul his kinsman.&nbsp; &#8220;I guess,&#8221; says the bishop, &#8220;that some others must
have wrought this ill deed.&#8221;&nbsp; Borgar the son of Jatvor Erlend&#146;s daughter,
who dwelt at Goathill, (13) he had seen the ship of burden when it fared from
the south, and fared back south.&nbsp; But when that was heard, then men
thought that this must have been by the plotting of Frakok and Oliver the
unruly.&nbsp; But when these tidings were noised about the isles, that earl
Paul was away and gone, and no man knew what was become of him, then they
sought counsel among themselves, and there were very many who then fared to
find earl Rognvald, and swore fealty to him.&nbsp; But Sigurd of Westness, and
his sons Brynjulf and Hakon pike, said they would swear oaths to no man, while
they were without news of earl Paul, whether he were to be looked for back or
not.&nbsp; There were more men too who refused to take oaths to earl Rognvald,
but there were some who laid down a time or a day when they would come over into
his hand if nothing was then heard of earl Paul.&nbsp; But when earl Rognvald
saw that he had to do with many mighty men, then he took crossly nothing that
the freemen asked.&nbsp; And so time went on, that every now and then he held
Things with the freemen, and from time to time some of them came over to his
hand at each Thing.</p>

<p>Now it happened one day at Kirkwall, that earl Rognvald had a Thing with the
freemen, and when men were at the Thing, it was seen how nine armed men came
from Scapa-neck to the Thing.&nbsp; And when they came to the Thing, there they
knew Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son, and men were eager to know what tidings he had to
tell.&nbsp; Sweyn had sailed in his ship from the south to Scapa-neck, and
there left his ship, but he and his men walked to Kirkwall afterwards.&nbsp;
And so when they came on the place of meeting, then his friends and kinsfolk
flocked round him, and asked him what news, but he answered little, and bade
them call the bishop to him.&nbsp; But the bishop greeted Sweyn well, for they
had long been friends.&nbsp; They two went aside to talk, and Sweyn tells the
bishop all the truth about his doings, and bade him now take counsel with him
about these knotty points.&nbsp; The bishop said:&nbsp; &#8220;These are mickle
tidings that thou tellest Sweyn, and it is more than likely that we two shall
not be able to settle this matter by ourselves;&nbsp; and now my will is that
thou bidest for me here, but I will go and back thy suit before all the people
and earl Rognvald.&#8221;&nbsp; Then the bishop goes to the meeting, and craves for a
hearing, and when he got it, then the bishop pleads Sweyn&#146;s cause, and said for
what cause he had fared away from the Orkneys, and what penalties earl Paul had
laid on him for the slaying of Sweyn breastrope, that worst of men.&nbsp; Then
the bishop begged of earl Rognvald for peace on Sweyn'&#146; part, and he begs it
too of all the people.&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald answers:&nbsp; &#8220;I give my word
that Sweyn shall have peace from me for three nights, but methinks, bishop,
thou bearest that look beneath thy brow, as though ye two, Sweyn and thou, will
be able to tell us of some great tidings which have not yet come out.&nbsp; My
will is that thou takest Sweyn into thy keeping and be answerable for him, but
I will have a talk with him on the morrow."&#8221; "Yes, yes,&#8221; said the
bishop, &#8220;willingly will he talk with you, and that as soon as may be, and he
will become thy man if ye will take to him.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl answers:&nbsp;
&#8220;Methinks there are not over many friends of mine in this land, but still we
must talk more together ere I agree to that.&#8221;&nbsp; After that those four went
aside to talk, earl Rognvald, Kol his father, the bishop, and Sweyn Asleif&#146;s
son;&nbsp; then Sweyn tells them the lieve and the loath (14) of all that had
passed between him and earl Paul;&nbsp; but they took that counsel to let most
of the crowd of men fare away from the Thing.&nbsp; The earl stands up the
morning after, and gave the men then leave to go home.&nbsp; But when the crowd
of men broke up from the Thing, then he fetched this man and that man by
himself to come and talk with them, and made all men first promise Sweyn peace
who were by before he told the tidings.&nbsp; But the morning after Hacon
churl, brother of earl Magnus the saint, was got to go and tell Sigurd of
Westness and his sons of what had befallen the earl, and this too that he was
not to be looked for to take up his rule, and that he was maimed.&nbsp; Sigurd
says:&nbsp; &#8220;This methinks is great tidings about the earl&#146;s going away, but
that methinks is heaviest of all that he is maimed, for there is no place
whither he could have gone that I would not fare to find him out if he were
hale.&#8221;&nbsp; And so he had said to his friends afterwards, that Hacon should
not have gone away unmaimed if he had had force enough when he [Hacon] told him
this story, he took it so much to heart.</p>

<p>But after these tidings, all men in the Orkneys went over into earl
Rognvald&#146;s hands, and now he became sole chief over that realm which earl Paul
had owned.&nbsp; And not long after the ground plan was marked out for Magnus&#146;
church, and builders were gathered for it;&nbsp; and the work went on so fast in
three years, that less was done in four or five thenceforth.&nbsp; Kol was the
man who looked most after the workmanship of the building, and had most of the
guidance as to the plan.&nbsp; But as the building went on, it grew costly to
the earl, and his money was far spent.&nbsp; Then the earl sought for counsel
to his father.&nbsp; But Kol gave him that advice that the earl should bring in
a law to the effect that the earls had taken all freehold lands in inheritance
after men, but that the heirs had to redeem them for their own, and that was
thought rather hard.&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald made them call together a Thing,
and offered the freemen the choice of buying their freeholds out and out, so
that there was no need to redeem them.&nbsp; And that they agreed on among
themselves, so that all were well pleased.&nbsp; But a mark was to be paid to
the earl for every plough-land over all the isles.&nbsp; But thenceforth money
was not lacking for the church building, and that building is wrought with much
toil and pains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>81.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When earl Rognvald had ruled
two winters over the Orkneys, then he kept the Yule feast at one of his farms
which is called Knarstead.&nbsp; It was the sixth Yule day, that a ship was seen
faring from the south from the Pentland firth.&nbsp; The weather was good, and
the earl stood out of doors, and many men by him, and looked and thought what
that ship might be.&nbsp; That man was there whose name was Hrolf, and he was
the earl&#146;s body-priest.&nbsp; And when these men came to land, then they went
up from their ship, and the earl&#146;s men kept count of them and reckoned that
they might be fifteen or sixteen men.&nbsp; But at the head of the band walked
a man in a blue cape, and he had tucked his hair under the hood;&nbsp; he had
shaven the beard from his chin in front, but his jaws and cheeks were unshaven,
and there (the hair) hung down full and long.&nbsp; This man seemed rather
strange to them (the earl&#146;s men), but Hrolf the Priest knew that man, and says
that that was bishop John who had come down from Scotland out of Athole.&nbsp;
Then the earl went to meet them, and gives the bishop a hearty welcome.&nbsp;
The earl seated the bishop on his own high-seat, but waits himself at the board
before him like a page.&nbsp; Next morning the bishop held mass early, and then
he fared north to Egil&#146;s isle to see bishop William, and was there till the
tenth Yule day.&nbsp; Then both the bishops fared to see earl Rognvald with a
worthy following, and brought out their errand.&nbsp; They tell him of that
agreement between Sweyn&#146;s Asleif&#146;s son and earl Maddad, that their son Harold
should fare out into the Orkneys to be fostered by earl Rognvald, with this
understanding that Harold should bear the title of earl, and have half the
Orkneys with earl Rognvald, but they should both have one court, and that earl
Rognvald should rule for both of them, and do so though Harold grew to be a
man;&nbsp; and if each had a will of his own, then earl Rognvald was to have
his way.&nbsp; Sweyn was there too, and brought this matter forward along with
the bishop.&nbsp; So earl Rognvald and his friends took this counsel, that a
meeting was fixed for the spring at Lent in Caithness, and then an agreement
was made on those terms, and was bound by the oaths of the best men of the
Orkneys and of Scotland.&nbsp; Then Harold Maddad&#146;s son fared out into the
Orkneys with earl Rognvald, and there and then the title of earl was given
him.&nbsp; Then Thorbjorn clerk fared unto the isles with earl Harold;&nbsp; he
was a son of Thorstein the freeman and Gudrun Frakok&#146;s daughter;&nbsp; he was a
wise man and of great weight;&nbsp; he then fostered earl Harold, and had great
power over him.&nbsp; Thorbjorn took to himself a wife in the Orkneys, and got
Ingirid (1) Olaf&#146;s daughter, Sweyn Asleif son&#146;s sister.&nbsp; Thorbjorn was
then by turns either out there in the Orkneys or up in Scotland, and he was the
boldest of men, and the most unfair overbearing man in most things.&nbsp; Sweyn
Asleif's son took under him all those estates which his father Olaf and his
brother Waltheof had owned;&nbsp; he then became a mighty chief, and always had
a great company of men with him.&nbsp; He was a wise man and foresighted (2)
about many things;&nbsp; an unfair overbearing man, and reckless towards
others.&nbsp; There were not at that time those two men west across the sea,
who were not of greater birth, who were thought of more power and weight than
those brothers-in-law Sweyn and Thorbjorn.&nbsp; There was then between them
great love.</p>

<p>82.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It fell out once that Sweyn Asleif&#146;s
son came to talk with earl Rognvald, and asked that he would give him strength
of men and ships to avenge on Oliver and Frakok the burning of his father
Olaf.&nbsp; The earl spoke and said:&nbsp; &#8220;Do not think, Sweyn, that either of
us need now look for harm at the hands of either Oliver or Frakok, a carline,
who is fit for nothing.&#8221;&nbsp; Sweyn answers:&nbsp; &#8220;There will always be harm
at their hands so long as they live;&nbsp; and I must say I then looked for
other things when I did my utmost for thy sake, than that thou shouldest not
grant me such things [as I now ask].&#8221;&nbsp; The earl answers:&nbsp; &#8220;What help
then shall I give thee which will please thee?&#8221;&nbsp; Sweyn answers:&nbsp; &#8220;Two
ships well fitted and manned.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl said it should be as he
asked.&nbsp; And after that Sweyn busked him for that voyage, and when he was
&#8220;boun&#8221; he sailed south to Broadfirth, and took the north-west wind to Dufeyra.
(3)&nbsp; That is a market town in Scotland.&nbsp; But thence he sailed into
the land along the shore of Murray and to Ekkjalsbakka.&nbsp; Thence he fared
next of all to Athole to earl Maddad and lay at the place called Elgin.&nbsp;
Then he [the earl] gave Sweyn guides, who knew the paths over fells and wastes,
whither he wished to go.&nbsp; Thence he fared the upper way over fells and
wood, above all places where men dwelt, and came out in Helmsdale, near the
middle of Sutherland.&nbsp; But Oliver and his men had spies out everywhere
where they thought that strife was to be looked for from the Orkneys, but on
this way they did not at all look for warriors.&nbsp; So they were not ware of
the host before Sweyn and his men had come to a slope at the back of Frakok&#146;s
homestead.&nbsp; There came against them Oliver the unruly with sixty
men;&nbsp; then they fell to battle at once, and there was a short
struggle.&nbsp; Oliver and his men gave way towards the homestead, for they
could not get to the wood.&nbsp; Then there was a great slaughter of men, but
Oliver he fled away up to Helmsdale water, and swam across the river and so up
on to the fell, and thence he fared to Scotland&#146;s firth, and so out to the
Southern isles.&nbsp; And he is out of the story.&nbsp; But when Oliver drew
off, Sweyn and his men fared straight up to the house and plundered it of
everything, but after that they burnt the homestead, and all those men and
women who were inside it.&nbsp; And there Frakok lost her life.&nbsp; Sweyn and
his men did there the greatest harm in Sutherland ere they fared to their
ships.&nbsp; After that they lay out that summer, and harried round
Scotland.&nbsp; Sweyn came home at autumn to the Orkneys to see earl
Rognvald;&nbsp; and he gave Sweyn a hearty welcome;&nbsp; then Sweyn fared
across to the Ness to Duncansby, and sat there that winter.&nbsp; At that time
came a message by word of mouth to Sweyn from Holdbodi out of the Southern
isles, that Sweyn should come to help him, for thither to Tyree had come a
Freeman from Wales, and had chased Holdbodi out of house and home, and had
robbed him of much goods.&nbsp; That man was called Robert who was sent,
English by kin.&nbsp; Sweyn bestirred himself at once when the message was sent
to him, and came out into the Orkneys to meet earl Rognvald, and begged earl
Rognvald that he would give him force and ships.&nbsp; The earl asked what
Sweyn wanted to take in hand.&nbsp; He said that man had sent him word, to whom
of all others he ought to be the last to say &#8220;nay,&#8221; and who had stood him then
in best stead, when he had most need when almost every one turned against
him.&nbsp; The earl answers:&nbsp; &#8220;It were well then if ye two parted friends,
but most South-islanders are untrue;&nbsp; but thou wilt be able to show thy
manliness, and I will give thee two ships thoroughly manned.&#8221;&nbsp; This pleases
Sweyn well, and they fared then to the Southern isles, and he did not find
Holdbodi before he got as far west as Man, for he [Holdbodi] had fled away
thither.&nbsp; But when Sweyn came to Man, then Holdbodi was fain to see
him.&nbsp; And there in Man that Freeman from Wales had done great harm in
plunderings and manslayings, and so wide about in the Southern-isles.&nbsp;
Before him had fallen a man of birth and worth, whose name was Andrew;&nbsp; he
left behind him a wife whose name was Ingirid, and a son whose name was Sigmund
angle.&nbsp; Ingirid the housewife had much goods and a great homestead.&nbsp;
Holdbodi gave Sweyn that advice to ask for her hand, but when that question was
put to her, then she said that Sweyn must do that deed for his match, to avenge
her husband Andrew.&nbsp; Sweyn answers that he might do the Welshmen some
harm, &#8220;but I cannot tell how it will be fated as to loss of life.&#8221;&nbsp; And
after that those two, Sweyn and Holdbodi, went on warfare and had five
ships.&nbsp; They harried round Wales, and went up on land at the place called
Earlsness, and did there great mischief.&nbsp; It was one morning that they
went up into a certain thorpe, and there was but a little struggle.&nbsp; The
householders fled out of the thorpe, but Sweyn and his men plundered it of
everything, and burnt six homesteads before their breakfast.&nbsp; There was
then with Sweyn a man from Iceland, whose name was Eric, and he sang this
stave:&nbsp; &#8220;Farms are in flames, But farmers are robbed;&nbsp; So hath Sweyn
willed it, Six in one morning:&nbsp; Wild work enough too&nbsp; He wrought
there to one man, Letting the leaseholder Livecoal on lease."&nbsp; After
that they fared to their ship, and lay out that summer and got much war-spoil,
but the Freeman ran away to that isle which is called Lund. (4)&nbsp; There was
a good stronghold;&nbsp; Sweyn and Holdbodi sat before it for some time, and
could do nothing.&nbsp; And they fared home in the autumn to Man.</p>

<p>83.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That winter Sweyn made his
wedding-feast with Ingirid, and then sat there in great honour.&nbsp; Next
spring he gathered men to him, and fared to see Holdbodi, and asked him for
force of men, but he begged off, and said the men were many of them at work,
but some were on trading voyages, and Sweyn got nothing of what he asked.&nbsp;
But there was proof plain that the Freeman and Holdbodi had come to terms by
stealth, and bound their bargain by gifts.&nbsp; But Sweyn fared away
nevertheless, and had then three ships, and they got little spoil in goods at
the beginning of the summer.&nbsp; But as time went on they fared south under
Ireland, and took there a bark which the monks of the Scilly Isles owned and
plundered it.&nbsp; He harried also far and wide on Ireland, and took there
much goods, and they fared home at autumn to Man, and had a great force.&nbsp;
Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son had sat there at home but a scant time, when he heard this
rumour that Holdbodi would not be true to him but Sweyn would not hear of such
a thing.&nbsp; And one night about winter those tidings happened, that Sweyn&#146;s
watchmen came and said that strife was coming upon them.&nbsp; Sweyn and his
men ran to their weapons and out of doors.&nbsp; They saw where men were coming
with fire to the homestead, and they had a great band.&nbsp; Then Sweyn and his
men sprung up on a hillock and defended themselves thence;&nbsp; they had horns
and blew them.&nbsp; But that place is thickly peopled, and men flocked to help
Sweyn and his band, so that the end of it was, that those who had come against
them fell off.&nbsp; Sweyn and his men followed them up and chased them.&nbsp;
There many men fell in the flight, but a crowd were wounded on either side ere
they parted.&nbsp; But Holdbodi was the leader of this band, and he had taken
himself off in the flight.&nbsp; He fared away till he came to Lundy;&nbsp; the
Freeman gave him a hearty welcome, and they held together.&nbsp; Sweyn fared
home, and had many men with him and kept good watch and ward, for he put little
faith in the South-islanders.&nbsp; When the stores of Sweyn and his men began
to fail, the folk quarrelled with him;&nbsp; and he sold his lands when the
winter went on for money and goods, and fared early in the spring from the
South to the Lewes, and stayed there a long time.&nbsp; He had done much
mischief in this voyage.</p>

<p>84.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sweyn was in the Southern
isles, earl Rognvald had fared to Caithness, and went to a feast at Wick with
that man whose name was Hroald, his wife&#146;s name was Arnljot.&nbsp; Sweyn was
the name of their son, and he was the briskest of men.&nbsp; But when the earl
was at the feast, Thorbjorn clerk and his men came down from Scotland, and told
these tidings that Thorstein the freeman his father was slain, and that a
Scottish earl had slain him, but that earl&#146;s name was Waltheof.&nbsp; But men
made that a matter of talk what a deal earl Rognvald and Thorbjorn had to say
to one another, for the earl could scarce finish the business he had in hand
for their talk.&nbsp; Thorbjorn fared thence out into the isles with the earl,
but Sweyn Hroald&#146;s son then became the earl&#146;s waiting-man.&nbsp; Thorbjorn had
then been for a while in Scotland;&nbsp; he had let two men be slain who had
been at the burning of Frakok with Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son.&nbsp; But when Sweyn
came out of the Southern isles, then he fared home to Gairsay to his house, but
he did not go to see earl Rognvald as he was wont when he came off
warfare.&nbsp; But when the earl heard that he was come home, he asked
Thorbjorn if he thought he knew why it was that Sweyn would not come to see
him.&nbsp; Thorbjorn answers:&nbsp; &#8220;This I guess, that Sweyn mislikes me, for
that I let those men be slain who were with him at the burning of
Frakok.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl said:&nbsp; &#8220;I will not that ye two be at
strife.&#8221;&nbsp; And after that earl Rognvald fared to Gairsay, and tried to
bring about an atonement between them, and that was easy, for they both were
willing that the earl should settle the matter.&nbsp; After that he made them
good friends for that time, and that settlement was kept a long time after.</p>

<p>85.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that time a vessel from Iceland
came to the Orkneys, and that man was on board whose name was Hall, son of
Thorarin broad-paunch;&nbsp; he fared to live and lodge in Rinansey with Ragna
and her son Thorstein.&nbsp; He was ill at ease there, and begged Thorstein
that he would take him to earl Rognvald.&nbsp; They fared to find him, but the
earl would not take him into his service;&nbsp; but when they came home, then
Ragna asks how they had fared.&nbsp; Then Hall sang a song:&nbsp; &#8220;I sent thy
son on an errand, Ragna,&nbsp; Man to man speaks words of truth; &nbsp;This his
weighty calling was Place at court for me to ask;&nbsp; But the prince, of
rings the waster, He who rules with glory highest, Says he has warriors
enough;&nbsp; Said &#145;No&#146; to neighbour of the brawn.&#8221;&nbsp; A little after Ragna
fared to see earl Rognvald on some errand of her own.&nbsp; She was so &#8220;boun&#8221;
that she had a red cap on her head made of horsehair.&nbsp; And when the earl
saw that, he sang:&nbsp; &#8220;Never have I heard that ladies, All of them if highly
born, Wimples wore upon their heads;&nbsp; Soft-tongued grows not rings&#146;
assassin; (5) But now Ragna, gold-lands&#146; fury, (6) Binds a mare&#146;s tail round
her brow;&nbsp; She a bride in gay attire Goes to meet the wound-goose feeder.&#8221;
(7)&nbsp; Ragna said:&nbsp; &#8220;Now it comes to that which is often said that no
man is so wise as to see everything as it is, for this is of a horse and not of
a mare.&#8221;&nbsp; She took then a silken cloth, and threw it over her head as a
wimple, and still went on talking of her affairs.&nbsp; The earl was rather
slow in listening to her at first, but afterwards softened down his speech as
she went on, and she got her business settled as she wished, and leave for Hall
to live at the earl&#146;s court.&nbsp; And he was there long afterwards with earl
Rognvald.&nbsp; They made both of them together the old Key to Verse-making,
and let there be five strophes in each metre, but then the song seemed too
long, and now two strophes are sung in each metre.</p>

<p>86.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son
heard how Holdbodi was come into the Southern isles, then he begged Earl
Rognvald to give him strength to avenge himself.&nbsp; The earl gave him five
ships, and Thorbjorn clerk steered one of them, but Haflidi son of Thorkell
flayer the second, Duffnjal son of Havard Gunni&#146;s son the third, Richard
Thorleif&#146;s son the fourth, Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son the fifth.&nbsp; But as soon as
ever Holdbodi heard of Sweyn, then he fled back south to Lundy;&nbsp; and his
fellows took him to them.&nbsp; Sweyn and his companions slew many men in the
Southern isles, but plundered and burnt far and wide.&nbsp; They got much
goods, but they could not get at Holdbodi, and he never came back to the
Southern isles afterwards.&nbsp; Sweyn wanted to be in the Southern isles that
winter, but Thorbjorn and the rest wished to go home, and so late in the autumn
they fared from the south to Caithness, and came to Duncansby.&nbsp; And when
they were to share their war-spoil, then Sweyn said that all should have an
even share, save himself, who was to have a chief&#146;s share, for he said he alone
had led them, and said the earl had given them to him as help.&nbsp; He said too
he was the only one who had any quarrel with the South-islanders, but they had
none.&nbsp; But Thorbjorn thought he had not done a bit less work, and been not
a whit less a leader than Sweyn.&nbsp; They wished also that all the
ship-captains should have an even share.&nbsp; But the end of it was that Sweyn
had his way, for he had many more men to back him there on the Ness.&nbsp; But
Thorbjorn fared out to the Orkneys to find earl Rognvald, and told him how
things had gone between them and Sweyn, and how ill pleased they were that he
had robbed them of their shares.&nbsp; The earl said it would not be the only
time that Sweyn would be found to be no fair man in his dealings, &#8220;but still
the day will come when he will take his pay for his wrong-doings.&nbsp; But ye
shall not strive with him about this.&nbsp; I will give you as much out of my
goods as ye lose by him;&nbsp; my will also is that ye make no claim against
him for this, and it will be well if greater difficulties do not flow from
him;&nbsp; though I fear that we shall not have long to wait for this.&#8221;&nbsp;
Thorbjorn answers:&nbsp; &#8220;God thank you, lord, for this honour which ye do to
us, and we will not strive with Sweyn about this, but never hereafter will I be
his friend, and I will do him some dishonour instead of this.&#8221;&nbsp; And after
that Thorbjorn declares himself parted from Ingirid Sweyn&#146;s sister, and sent
her over to the Ness to Sweyn.&nbsp; He gave her a hearty welcome, but thought
great shame had been done to him.&nbsp; Then there was feud between them, and
it came to what the saw says, &#8220;Set a thief to catch a thief.&#8221;&nbsp; But still
neither now plotted openly against the other.</p>

<p>When Sweyn was in the Souther-isles, he had set Margad Grim&#146;s son in
Duncansby to govern it, and given into his hand that charge (8) which he held
of earl Rognvald.&nbsp; But Margad was quibbling and quarrelsome, and he became
hated for his unfairness.&nbsp; But those who were most sufferers by his
unfairness ran off to find master Hroald and kept themselves there with
him.&nbsp; From that a feud arose between Hroald and Margad.&nbsp; A little
after Sweyn had come home Margad fared south to Wick with nineteen men on some
business of his own.&nbsp; And ere he came from the south he made an onslaught
on master Hroald&#146;s house and slew him and some men more.&nbsp; After that they
fared to Duncansby to find Sweyn.&nbsp; Then Sweyn gathers men and fares to
Lambburg, and got the place ready.&nbsp; There was a good stronghold, and there
he sat with sixty men, and flitted thither for himself food and other stores,
which they needed to have.&nbsp; The burg stood on some sea-crags, but at the
top on the land side there was a stone wall well built.&nbsp; The rocks went
far along the sea the other way.&nbsp; They did there much mischief in
Caithness in robberies, and flitted thither their spoil into the burg, and they
became much hated.</p>

<p>87.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tidings came to the ears
of earl Rognvald and Sweyn Hroald&#146;s son;&nbsp; Sweyn begged the earl for help
that he might set this matter straight;&nbsp; many men backed this prayer with
Sweyn.&nbsp; So it came about that earl Rognvald bestirred himself and fared
over to the Ness, and these chiefs with him;&nbsp; Thorbjorn, Haflidi Thorkel&#146;s
son, Duffnjal Havard&#146;s son, and Richard, and they were the worst in their
counsel against Sweyn.&nbsp; They fared to Duncansby, and Sweyn was then
away.&nbsp; It was said that he had fared south to Wick, and they fared
thither.&nbsp; But when they came there they heard that Sweyn was in
Lambburg.&nbsp; Then the earl and his men fared thither.&nbsp; And when they
came to the burg, then Sweyn asks who ruled over the band.&nbsp; He was told
that Earl Rognvald ruled over it.&nbsp; Sweyn greeted him well and asked the
earl after his errand.&nbsp; The earl answers that he wills that he should hand
over Margad into their power.&nbsp; Sweyn asks whether he shall have
peace.&nbsp; The earl said he would not promise that.&nbsp; Then Sweyn
said:&nbsp; &#8220;I cannot find it in my heart to give Margad up to the power of
Sweyn Hroald&#146;s son and his band, or any other of my foes, those I mean who are
with you, but willingly would I be atoned with you, lord.&#8221;&nbsp; Then Thorbjorn
clerk answers:&nbsp; &#8220;Hear now what the lord&#146;s traitor says, that he will
willingly be atoned;&nbsp; but he has already robbed his land, and lain out
like a thief.&nbsp; Ill repayest thou the earl the many honours which he has
done to thee, as thou wilt [repay] all those over whom thou mayest be able to come.&#8221;&nbsp;
Sweyn answers:&nbsp; &#8220;Thou hast no need Thorbjorn, to throw in so much talk
here, for it will not be done after thy words.&nbsp; But that is my foreboding
that thou wilt repay him in the worst way the honour that he has done thee ere
ye two part, for that none will ever reap luck from thee who have aught to do
with thee.&#8221;&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald bade that men should not rail at one
another.&nbsp; After that they sat themselves down round the burg, and forbade
all ingoings of food, and so it went on for a long time that they could do
nothing in the way of attack.&nbsp; And when their food was wellnigh spent,
then Sweyn called his men together and sought counsel of them, but all men
spoke with one mouth that they would have his guidance and foresight while they
had the choice of it.&nbsp; Then Sweyn took to words, and said:&nbsp; &#8220;It seems
to me most unworthy to starve here, but after all to fall into the power of
one&#146;s foes.&nbsp; And this too has gone, as was likely, [and proves] that we
lack both wit and luck when matched with earl Rognvald.&nbsp; And here now it
was tried to bring about peace and atonement, but neither could be got for
Margad my companion;&nbsp; but though I know that all other men here will have
a choice of peace, yet I cannot find it in my heart to hand him over [to fall]
under the axe.&nbsp; Now it is not right that so many should pay for his
perplexity, though I dare not part from him even yet.&#8221;&nbsp; And after this
Sweyn took that counsel to knit together those ropes that they had.&nbsp; But
at night then they let Sweyn and Margad slip down out of the burg into the
sea.&nbsp; And after that they took to swimming, and struck out along the rocks
till the cliffs broke off.&nbsp; After that they stepped on land, and fared up
into Sutherland, and so to Murray, and thence to Dufeyri.&nbsp; There they
found some Orkneymen in a ship of burden;&nbsp; the man&#146;s name was Hallvard who
was their chief, but the second&#146;s name was Thorkell;&nbsp; they were ten in
all.&nbsp; Sweyn and Margad went on board ship with them, and they twelve
together fared in the ship of burden south off Scotland till they came to the
isle of May.&nbsp; There was then a monastery.&nbsp; Baldwin was the abbot&#146;s
name who ruled over it.&nbsp; There Sweyn and his men were seven nights
weather-bound, and said that they were sent to find the Scot-king from earl
Rognvald.&nbsp; The monks doubted their story, and thought they were robbers,
and sent to the land for men.&nbsp; But when Sweyn and his men were ware of
that, then they sprang on shipboard and plundered the place of much
goods.&nbsp; They fared away and in up Murkfirth. (9)&nbsp; They found in
Edinburgh David the Scot-king;&nbsp; he gave Sweyn a hearty welcome, and bade
them stay with him.&nbsp; Sweyn told the king the whole story of his coming
thither, and how things had gone between him and earl Rognvald ere they parted,
and so also that they had robbed in the isle of May.&nbsp; Sweyn and his men
were there for a while with the Scot-king in good cheer.&nbsp; King David sent
men to those men who had lost goods at Sweyn&#146;s hands in his voyage, and let
them put their own worth on their scathe, but made good with his own money to
each his loss.&nbsp; King David offered Sweyn to send and fetch his wife from
the Orkneys, but to give him such honour in Scotland as he might well be
pleased with.&nbsp; Sweyn laid bare his will before the king, and spoke thus
that his wish was that Margad should be there behind with the king, but that he
should send word to earl Rognvald that he should take an atonement at his hand,
but Sweyn says that he was ready to lay all his suit in earl Rognvald&#146;s
power;&nbsp; he said he would ever be well-pleased if they were good friends,
but ill-pleased if they were foes.&nbsp; King David answers:&nbsp; &#8220;It is now
clear both that this earl must be worthy, and besides that ye think that only
worth having which looks towards him;&nbsp; for now thou riskest all on his
good faith, but givest up that which we offer thee.&#8221;&nbsp; Sweyn says he will
never give up his friendship, but still says that he must beg the king to grant
him this.&nbsp; The king said so it should be.&nbsp; King David sent men north
into the Orkneys with gifts, and this message, that the earl should take
atonement from Sweyn.&nbsp; Then Sweyn too fared north into the isles, but
Margad stayed behind with the king.&nbsp; King David&#146;s messengers fared to find
earl Rognvald.&nbsp; He gave them a hearty welcome, took the gifts too which
the king sent him, and gave his word as to the atonement.&nbsp; He took Sweyn
after that into his peace and full friendship, and then he [Sweyn] fared back
to his house.</p>

<p>88.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sweyn and Margad were away out
of Lambburg, those who were in the burg took that counsel to give up the place
into earl Rognvald&#146;s power.&nbsp; He asked what was the last they knew of Sweyn
and Margad;&nbsp; but they told him all about it.&nbsp; And when the earl heard
that, he said:&nbsp; &#8220;Sooth it is to say that no man is Sweyn&#146;s match of all
those men of whom we have a choice here with us;&nbsp; such deeds are both
manly and hardy.&nbsp; But I will not be a dastard towards you, though ye have
been woven up in this difficulty with Sweyn;&nbsp; each of you shall fare away
in peace from before me.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl fared home thence to the Orkneys, but
sent Thorbjorn clerk with forty men on board a ship south to Broadfirth to look
after Sweyn and Margad, and naught could be heard of him.&nbsp; Then Thorbjorn
speaks out and tells them that they are going on wondrously:&nbsp; &#8220;Here we are
driving along ever so far at Sweyn&#146;s heels, but we have heard that earl
Waltheof my father&#146;s bane-man is but a short way hence with a small following
of men.&nbsp; And now if ye will fare with me against him, then will I give you
my word that I shall not behave as Sweyn, that I should make you robbed of your
share if war-spoil falls into our hands;&nbsp; for those goods which we shall
get ye shall have, but allot me that only which ye please, for methinks fame is
better than fee.&#8221;&nbsp; After that they fared to where earl Waltheof was at a
feast, and took the house over their heads, and set fire to it at once.&nbsp;
Waltheof and his men ran to the doors, and asked who was master of that
fire.&nbsp; Thorbjorn said who he was.&nbsp; Waltheof offered atonement for the
slaying of Thorstein, but Thorbjorn said there was no need to seek for a
settlement.&nbsp; Waltheof and his men defended themselves well for a
while.&nbsp; But when the fire pressed them hard, they sprang out, and then
their defence lasted but a short while, for they were much worn out by the
fire.&nbsp; There fell earl Waltheof and thirty men with him.&nbsp; There
Thorbjorn and his men got much goods, and he kept all his promise manfully by
his men;&nbsp; they fared after that out to the Orkneys to find earl Rognvald,
and he showed that he was well pleased at their errand.&nbsp; Then it was quiet
in the isles, and there was good peace.</p>

<p>In that time dwelt at Wyre, in the Orkneys, Kolbein the burly, a man from
Norway, and he was a very mighty man;&nbsp; he built him a good stone-castle
there;&nbsp; that was a safe stronghold.&nbsp; Kolbein had to wife Herbjorg, a
sister of Hacon bairn, but their mother was Sigrid a daughter of Herborg,
Paul&#146;s daughter.&nbsp; These were their children:&nbsp; Kolbein carle, Bjarni
skald, Summerled, Aslak, Frida.&nbsp; They were all of might and mark.</p>

<p>89.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that time the sons of Harold
Gilli ruled over Norway.&nbsp; Ingi and Sigurd were children in years.&nbsp;
Then liegemen were chosen as councillors to those brothers.&nbsp; Eystein was
the eldest of them.&nbsp; But Ingi was lawfully begotten, and the liegemen paid
most honour to him;&nbsp; he let them have their own way in everything as they
chose.&nbsp; In that time these liegemen had most to do with his counsel,
Ogmund and Erling, the sons of Kyrping-Worm.&nbsp; They took that counsel with
king Ingi, that he should send word to earl Rognvald, and give him a seemly
bidding to come and see him.&nbsp; They said, as was true, that the earl had
been a great friend of his father, and they bade him to behave as lovingly as
he could to the earl, so that he might be more his friend than his brothers&#146;,
whatever might arise between them.&nbsp; The earl was a kinsman of those
brothers, (10) and one of their greatest friends.&nbsp; But when these words
came to earl Rognvald, he listened to them quickly, and busks him for his
voyage, for he was eager to fare to Norway to see his kinsfolk and
friends.&nbsp; On this voyage earl Harold begged to go for the sake of
curiosity and pastime;&nbsp; he was then fourteen or fifteen years old.&nbsp;
And when the earls were &#8220;boun,&#8221; they fared from the west with chapmen, and had
a proper following, and came in the spring early to Norway.&nbsp; They found
king Ingi in Bergen, and king Ingi gave them a very hearty welcome;&nbsp; there
earl Rognvald found many of his kinsfolk and friends;&nbsp; he stayed there
very long that summer.&nbsp; That summer came from abroad, from Micklegarth,
(11) Eindrid the young;&nbsp; he had been there long in [the Emperor&#146;s]
service;&nbsp; he was able to tell them many tidings thence, and men thought it
a pastime to ask him about things that had happened abroad out in the
world.&nbsp; The earl often talked with him.&nbsp; And once on a time when they
were talking, then Eindrid said:&nbsp; &#8220;Methinks it is wonderful, earl, that
thou wilt not fare out to Jewry, and not have stories alone as to the tidings
which are to be told thence.&nbsp; That is the fittest place for such men as
thou for the sake of your skill;&nbsp; thou wilt be best honoured there when
thou fallest in with men of rank.&#8221;&nbsp; And when Eindrid had said that, many
others backed it with him, and egged the earl on that he should become the
leader of this voyage.&nbsp; Erling threw in many words in favour of it, and
said that he would make up his mind to join the voyage, if the earl would
become their leader.&nbsp; And so, when so many men of rank and birth were
eager, then the earl gave his word to go on the voyage.&nbsp; And when the earl
and Erling made up their minds to this, then many great men chose to go on this
voyage.&nbsp; These liegemen:&nbsp; Eindrid the young shall tell them the way,
John Peter&#146;s son, Aslak Erlend&#146;s son, and Gudorm Mjola-pate of Helgeland.&nbsp;
It was agreed that none of them should have a larger ship than one but the earl
should have a carved or painted or gilded ship.&nbsp; That should be done so
that no man might envy another for that one had fitted out his ship or his crew
better than another;&nbsp; John limp-leg shall get a ship made for the earl to
sail abroad in, and take the greatest pains with it.</p>

<p>Earl Rognvald fared home west in the autumn, and meant to sit two winters in
his realm.&nbsp; King Ingi gave the earl two long-ships, rather small but very
handsome, and made most for rowing, and they were the fastest of all
ships.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald gave one ship to earl Harold;&nbsp; that was named
&#8220;Arrow,&#8221; but the other was named &#8220;Help.&#8221;&nbsp; In these ships the earls held on
west across the sea.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald had also taken great gifts from his friends.&nbsp;
It was on Tuesday evening that the earl&#146;s put to sea, and they sailed with a
very good wind that night;&nbsp; and the wind began to get high.&nbsp;
Midweek-day (Wednesday) there was a mighty storm, but on Thursday night they
were ware of land.&nbsp; It was then very dark.&nbsp; They saw the surf of
breakers on every side about them.&nbsp; They had sailed in company up to
this.&nbsp; Then there was no other choice than to sail on and dash both ships
to pieces, and so they did.&nbsp; There were rocks a-head, and a little strip
of foreshore, but all the rest above cliffs.&nbsp; There all the men were
saved, but they lost much goods;&nbsp; some of it was thrown ashore in the
night.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald behaved himself then still best of all men, as he
ever did.&nbsp; He was so merry, that he played with his fingers and made verses
nearly at every word.&nbsp; He drew his finger-ring off his finger with his
lips and sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Here I hang with hammer bent</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hanger of the falcon&#146;s seat, (12)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the gallows of the hawk&#146;s bridge (13)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Golden ring to Odin&#146;s draught; (14)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cave-dwellers of giant voice</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Me so glad your pine hath made,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That I play now with my fingers,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Perch of hawk that harries geese.&#8221;</p>

<p>And when they had got together their baggage, they fared up into the country
to look for dwellings, for they thought they knew that they must have come to
Shetland.&nbsp; They found homesteads speedily, and then the men were shared
out amongst the houses of the district.&nbsp; Men were fain to see the earl
where he came, and the mistress asked about his voyage.&nbsp; The earl sang a
song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;There was a crash when ocean billow</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Crushed to pieces, Help and Arrow;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To those wives the storm brought sorrow,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wild waves threatened men with scathe;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I see this voyage of ready-witted</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Earls, will long be had in mind;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hard work surely had the seamen</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To withstand the watery shock.&#8221;</p>

<p>The housewife bore a cloak of skin to the earl instead of a cloak;&nbsp; he
took it laughingly, and reached out his hands towards her and sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Here I shake a wrinkled skin-cloak,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Strangely scanty is my dress;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That ship-plain that stands o&#146;er our</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Plaids and mantles rises high;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still perhaps attired more bravely</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the eel-mead&#146;s briny horse (15)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We may go;&nbsp; against the rocks</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dashed the surf the yardarm&#146;s steed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then great fires were made for them, and they roasted themselves at the
fires.&nbsp; Asa was the name of the waiting-maid.&nbsp; She went out for
water, and another woman with her.&nbsp; But when they came to the water Asa
stumbled into the well in the fog;&nbsp; but she ran home much chilled and
spoke between her shiverings, and men could not make out what she said.&nbsp;
The earl says he knows her tongue, and sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Be quiet, now, alas!&nbsp; but Asa</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Atatata! in water lieth;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hutututu!&nbsp; where by the fire</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shall I sit?&nbsp; I&#146;m very cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl sends twelve of his men to Einar in Gullberwick, but he said he
would not take them in unless the earl came himself.&nbsp; And when earl
Rognvald hears that, then he sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Einar says that he will nourish </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
None of Rognvald&#146;s trusty men</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Save the earl himself;&nbsp; now Odin&#146;s</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ocean(16) rises in my throat;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well I know the stout of heart</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne&#146;er yet broke his word to men;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Late at even in I went</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where the fires brightly blazed.&#8221;</p>

<p>This even happened one day south in Dynr&ouml;stvoe in Shetland, that an old and
poor householder waited long for his mate, but all the boats rowed out, each as
it was manned.&nbsp; Then came a man to the old householder in a white
cowl;&nbsp; and asked why he did not row out a-fishing like other men.&nbsp;
The householder says that his mate was not come.&nbsp; &#8220;Master,&#8221; says the cowl-man
wilt &#8220;thou that I row with thee?&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;That I will&#8221; says the householder,
&#8220;but still I must have the lot which falls to my boat;&nbsp; for I have many
bairns at home, and I work for them as well as I can.&#8221;&nbsp; After that they
rowed out off Dynr&ouml;sthead and inside the Hundholms.&nbsp; There was a strong
current there where they lay and great eddies;&nbsp; they had to lie in the
eddy and fish in the race.&nbsp; The cowl-man sat in the bow and paddled
against the tide;&nbsp; but the householder was to fish.&nbsp; The householder
bade him mind that they were not borne into the race;&nbsp; for then he said
they would run great risks.&nbsp; The cowl-man did not behave as he bade him,
and cared not though the householder came into a little danger.&nbsp; A little
after they were borne into the race, and the householder was very scared and
said &#8220;Wretch that I was for my ill-luck when I took you today to row;&nbsp; for
here I must die;&nbsp; but my folk at home have no one to help them, and will
all come to beggary if I am lost.&#8221;&nbsp; And the householder was so afraid that
he wept, and he dreaded that his death was nigh.&nbsp; The cowl-man answers,
&#8220;Be cheerful master, and do not weep;&nbsp; for he will pull us two out of the
race who let us fall into it.&#8221;&nbsp; After that the cowl-man rowed out of the
race, and the householder was very glad at that.&nbsp; Then they rowed to land,
and put up the boat.&nbsp; And the householder bade the cowl-man to go with him
and share the fish.&nbsp; But the cowl-man told the householder to share them
as he liked;&nbsp; he says he will not have more than his third.&nbsp; There
was much folk come down to the strand, both men and women, and many needy
folk.&nbsp; The cowl-man gave the poor all the fish which had fallen to his lot
that day;&nbsp; and then he made ready to go away.&nbsp; There was a steep
slope to walk up, and many woman sat on the slope.&nbsp; But as he went up the
slope his foot slipped, for it was slippery after rain, and he fell down from
the slope.&nbsp; A woman was the first to see that and laughed loud at him, and
after her other folk.&nbsp; But when the cowl-man heard that he sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;The nymph of silk with eyes of fire,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louder
laughs the lovely may, </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Than she aught at my array:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Few can tell an earl indeed,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus disguised in fisher&#146;s weed,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet through billows danger scorning,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I drew the boat this early morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that the cowl-man went away;&nbsp; and men became aware later that
this cowl-man had been earl Rognvald.&nbsp; It became also known afterwards to
many men that there had been many such feats of his which were both helpful in
the sight of God, and pleasant in the eyes of men.&nbsp; Men reckoned (to him)
also as a proverb what stood in the verse that &#8220;Few can tell an earl in
fisher&#146;s weeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl stayed very long in Shetland, and fared in the autumn south to the
Orkneys, and sat in his realm.&nbsp; That autumn two Iceland men came to him,
the one&#146;s name was Armod, and he was a skald;&nbsp; the other&#146;s Oddi the little
Glum&#146;s son, a man from Broadfirth, and he too made good verses.&nbsp; The earl
took to them both and gave them board and lodging in his train.&nbsp; The earl
had a great Yule feast, and bade men to it and gave gifts.&nbsp; He reached out
a spear inlaid with gold to Armod skald, and shook it as he did that, and bade
him make a song in return.&nbsp; [Armod sang]:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;The best of chiefs, of Odin&#146;s storm</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The rouser, does not trust his gifts</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To other men to bring to me,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The poet who will sound his praise;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The noble warder of the land,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first of kings, to Armod bore</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This best blood-taper (17) bright with gold,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And placed the weapon in his hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>It fell out one day about Yule that men were looking at the hangings;&nbsp;
then the earl said to Oddi the little:&nbsp; &#8220;Make thou a song about the
behaviour of that man who is there on the hanging, and have thou thy song sung
when I have ended my song;&nbsp; and mind and have none of those words in thy
song that I have in my song.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;The ring lord of the falcon&#146;s seat</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who, old in years, stands on the hanging</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Down from his shoulder by his side;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bandy-legs will not move forward,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through the grove of Ocean&#146;s brightness</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Waxes wrath with him who loves</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The icicle of battle-hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oddi sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Sword-god here with stooping shoulders</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stands, and thinks to hew with sword</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His rival in a woman&#146;s love</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the door of yonder tent;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He will do the men a mischief</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With his sword;&nbsp; and now &#145;tis time</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the loaders of the sea-skates</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To make friends ere wounds are given.&#8221;</p>

<p>It happened one day that a mad man got loose from his bonds, and rushed at
earl Rognvald;&nbsp; and clutched him so fast that the earl all but tottered to
his fall.&nbsp; Then the earl sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;At the mantle of the monarch</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sturdy beggar caught and clutched,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The carle was on the eve of hurling</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hard to earth the liberal lord;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still the tree of steel stood upright,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though men said they saw him stagger;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Might enow the sword-edge scatterer</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Careful keeps to hold his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl had also bishop William at his feast that Yule, and many of his
chieftains.&nbsp; Then he laid bare his plans how he meant to go away from the
land and out to Jewry;&nbsp; he begged the bishop to go with him on his
voyage.&nbsp; The bishop was a Paris clerk, and the earl wished above all
things that he should be their spokesman.&nbsp; The bishop promised to go with
him.</p>

<p>90.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These men made ready to go with earl
Rognvald:&nbsp; Magnus, son of Havard Gunni&#146;s son, and Sweyn Hroald&#146;s
son.&nbsp; They were captains of ships both of them.&nbsp; These fared of the
lesser men, so far as they are named:&nbsp; Thorgeir Scotpoll, Oddi the little,
Thorbjorn the swarthy, and Armod.&nbsp; These were the earl's skalds.&nbsp;
Then there were also these men:&nbsp; Thorkell crook-eye, and Grimkel of
Glettness, and Blian, son of Thorstein of Flydruness. --- And when those two
winters were spent which they were to have to get ready, earl Rognvald fared
out of the Orkneys east to Norway early in the spring, and wished to know how
those liegemen got on with their outfit.&nbsp; And when the earl came to
Bergen, he found there Erling wryneck and John limp-leg the earl&#146;s
brother-in-law.&nbsp; There too had come Aslak, but Gudorm came a little
after.&nbsp; There too was that ship off the wharf which John had got made for
the earl;&nbsp; it had five-and-thirty seats for rowers, and was a very careful
piece of work, and the figure-head and taffrail and weather-vanes were all
overlaid with gold, and she was carved and painted in many other places;&nbsp;
the ship was the greatest treasure of her kind.&nbsp; Eindrid came also from
time to time to the town that summer, and always says that he would be boun the
week after;&nbsp; but men were ill-pleased when they had to wait so long.&nbsp;
Some wished that he should not be waited for, and said that men had sailed on
such voyages before though Eindrid were not with them.&nbsp; And a little while
after Eindrid came to the town and gave out that he was then boun, and then the
earl bade him set sail as soon as ever he thought he was like to get a fair wind.&nbsp;
And when that day came that they thought they had a good chance, they pulled
out of the town and took to their sails.&nbsp; The wind was rather light, and
the earl&#146;s ship made little way, for she needed a good breeze.&nbsp; The other
chiefs slackened sail, and would not sail away from the earl.&nbsp; But as they
drew away from among the isles, the wind began to get sharp, and then it grew
so high that they had to reef sail on board the smaller ships, but the earl&#146;s
ship began to walk fast.&nbsp; Then they saw two big ships sailing after them
and at once by and beyond them.&nbsp; One of those ships was a work of much
pains, it was a drake;&nbsp; both the head forward and the coils aft were much
gilded.&nbsp; It was gay and gaudy, and painted all above the water-line wherever
it seemed to look well.&nbsp; The earl&#146;s men said that there must Eindrid be
sailing, &#8220;and he has kept little to that which was laid down, that no one
should have a carved or gilded ship but thou, lord.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl says:&nbsp;
&#8220;Great is Eindrid&#146;s pride.&nbsp; But now there is this excuse for his refusing
to be equal with us that we have been so far wrong in our opinion as to
him;&nbsp; but it is hard to see whether luck goes before him or after
him;&nbsp; we will not shape our course after his haste.&#8221;&nbsp; Then Eindrid
bore speedily away from them in that big ship, but the earl kept in company
with his ships, and they had a good passage.&nbsp; They came about autumn to
the Orkneys safe and sound.&nbsp; Then it was thought best that they should sit
there that winter;&nbsp; some sat at their own cost, but some were with the
householders, and many with the earl. --- In the isles there was great stir
that winter, and the Easterlings and the Orkneyingers fell asunder about
bargains and love-matters, and many quarrels sprang up.&nbsp; The earl took
great pains to keep watch on those on both sides who thought they wre bound to
repay him for all the good he had done them, and that they were worthy of all
good from him. --- Of Eindrid and his messmates that is to be told that they
came to Shetland;&nbsp; and he dashed there that good ship to splinters and
lost much goods, but the lesser ship was saved.&nbsp; Eindrid was that winter
in Shetland, and sent men east to Norway to let them build him a ship for his
voyage abroad.</p>

<p>There was a man named Arni spindleshanks, a messmate of Eindrid&#146;s;&nbsp; he
fared south into the Orkneys that winter and nine of his companions with
him.&nbsp; Arni was a very unfair man and bold and strong.&nbsp; He and his
companions sat at his own cost in one of the isles that winter.&nbsp; Arni buys
malt and cattle for slaughter from a tenant of Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son;&nbsp; but
when he asked for the price, Arni put him off.&nbsp; And a second time, when he
asked for it, he was paid with threats, and ere they parted Arni gave him a
blow with the back of his axe and said this:&nbsp; &#8220;Go now and tell that champion
Sweyn with whom thou art ever threatening us, and let him set thy lot
straight;&nbsp; thou wilt not need more than this.&#8221;&nbsp; The husbandman went
and told Sweyn and bade him set his lot straight.&nbsp; Sweyn answers shortly
about it, and said he could make no promise about it.&nbsp; It was one day
about spring that Sweyn fared to get in his rents;&nbsp; they were four of them
in an eight-oared boat.&nbsp; Their course lay by that isle in which Arni and
his men sat.&nbsp; Sweyn told his men to pull in towards the land, but there
was a strong ebb tide on.&nbsp; Sweyn went on shore alone, and had his hand-axe
in his hand and no other weapons.&nbsp; He bade them watch the boat so that the
ebb did not leave it high and dry.&nbsp; Arni and his men sat in an outhouse a
short way from the sea.&nbsp; Sweyn went up to the outhouse and into it.&nbsp;
Arni and five of his men were inside and hailed Sweyn;&nbsp; he took their
greeting, and spoke to Arni, and told him that he must pay up his debt to the
husbandman.&nbsp; Arni said there was good time still for that.&nbsp; Sweyn
bade him do as he asked him, and pay up the debt.&nbsp; Arni said he would not
do so for all that.&nbsp; Sweyn said he would only ask him for a little more,
and with that he struck his axe against Arni&#146;s head, so that it went up to the
back of the blade, and he lost his hold of the axe.&nbsp; Sweyn sprang out, but
Arni&#146;s messmates looked to him, but some ran after Sweyn down into the
mud.&nbsp; So they ran along the shore and one was fleetest;&nbsp; Sweyn and
his pursuer were then at very close quarters.&nbsp; Great sea-weed tangles lay
on the shore in the mud.&nbsp; Sweyn caught up one of the tangles and dashed it
into the face of him who was nearest to him, sand and all.&nbsp; This man took
to rubbing his eyes with both hands, and wiped the sand out of them.&nbsp; But
Sweyn got clear off to his boat, and fared home to Gairsay to his house.&nbsp;
A little while after Sweyn fared over to the Ness on an errand of his
own;&nbsp; he sent word to earl Rognvald that he should take an atonement for
the slaying of Arni spindleshanks.&nbsp; And as soon as these words came to
him, he [the earl] summoned to him all those who had the blood feud for the
slaying of Arni, and made matters up with them, so that they were pleased, and
he paid up the fine himself.&nbsp; Much other mischief the earl made good with
his own money that was wrought that winter both by the Easterlings and
Orkneyingers, for they had pulled very ill together.&nbsp; In the spring very
early the earl summoned a crowded Thing in Hrossey;&nbsp; thither came all the
chiefs who were in his realm.&nbsp; Then he made it bare to them that he meant
to go out of the land to Jewry, and says that he would give over his realm into
the hands of Harold Maddod&#146;s son, his kinsman.&nbsp; He begged this that all
would follow him like true men in whatever he might need while he was
away.&nbsp; Earl Harold was then nearly a man of twenty. (18)&nbsp; He was a
tall man of growth, and stout and strong, an ugly man and wise enough, and men
thought him a likely man for a chief.&nbsp; Thorbjorn clerk had then most share
in ruling the land with him when earl Rognvald first fared out of the Orkneys.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>91.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Rognvald busked him that
summer to leave the Orkneys, and he was rather late boun, for they had a long
while to wait for Eindrid, as his ship did not come from Norway which he had
let be made there the winter before.&nbsp; But when they were boun, they held
on their course away from the Orkneys in fifteen big ships.&nbsp; These were
then the ship-captains;&nbsp; earl Rognvald, bishop William, Erling wry-neck,
Aslak Erlend&#146;s son, Gudorm, Mjola-pate of Helgeland, Magnus Havard&#146;s son, Sweyn
Hroald&#146;s son, Eindrid the young, John Peter&#146;s son limpleg, and those five whose
names are not told.&nbsp; They were Eindrid&#146;s men.&nbsp; They sailed away from
the Orkneys, and south to Scotland, and so on to England, and as they sailed by
Northumberland, off Humbermouth, Armod sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;The sea was high off Humbermouth</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When our ships were beating out,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bends the mast and sinks the land</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#145;Neath our lee off Vesla-sand;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wave with veil of foam that rises</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Drives not in the eyes of him</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who now sits at home;&nbsp; the stripling</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the meeting rideth dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sailed thence south round England and to France. (1)&nbsp; Nothing is
said of their voyage before that they came to that seaburg which is named
Nerbon. (2)&nbsp; There these tidings had happened, that the earl who before
had ruled the town was dead;&nbsp; his name was Germanus;&nbsp; he left behind
him a daughter young and fair, whose name was Ermingerd.&nbsp; She kept watch
and ward over her father&#146;s inheritance with the counsel of the most noble men
of her kinsfolk.&nbsp; They gave that counsel to the queen that she should bid
the earl to a worthy feast, and said that by that she would be famous if she
welcomed heartily such men of rank who had come so far to see her, and who
would bear her fame still further.&nbsp; The queen bade them see to that.&nbsp;
And when this counsel had been agreed on by them, men were sent to the earl and
he was told that the queen bade him to a feast with as many of his men as he
chose to bring with him.&nbsp; The earl of his men bidding with thanks;&nbsp;
he chose out all his best men for this journey with him.&nbsp; And when they
came to the feast, there was the best cheer, and nothing was spared which could
do the earl more honour than he had ever met before.&nbsp; One day it happened
as the earl sat at the feast that the queen came into the hall and many women
with her, she held a beaker of gold in her hand.&nbsp; She was dressed in the
best clothes, had her hair loose as maidens wont to have, and had put a golden
band round her brow.&nbsp; She poured the wine into the earl&#146;s cup, but her
maidens danced before them.&nbsp; The earl took her hand and the beaker too and
set her on his knee, and they talked much that day.&nbsp; Then the earl sang a
song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Sure it is, O lady lovely,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That thy stature far outvies</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Form of women whose attire</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gleams well fringed with Frodi&#146;s meal; (3)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Locks as soft as yellow silk,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lets the maiden downward fall</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On her shoulders;&nbsp; I have reddened</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Eager eagles&#146; crooked claws.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl stayed there very long in the best of cheer.&nbsp; The townsmen
pressed the earl to settle down there, and spoke out loudly about how they
would give him the lady to wife.&nbsp; The earl said he would fare on that
voyage which he had purposed, but said he would come thither as he fared back,
and then they could carry out their plan [or not] as they pleased.&nbsp; After
that the earl busked him away thence with his fellow voyagers.&nbsp; And as
they sailed west of Thrasness they have a good wind;&nbsp; then they sat and
drank and were very merry.&nbsp; Then the earl sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Noble youth will long remember</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Words which Ermingerda spoke;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brave bride wills that we should ride</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
O&#146;er Ran&#146;s home to Jordan&#146;s stream;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But when back the water-horse&#146;s</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Woods (4) fare north across the wave,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He will cut the whale-land then</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Home to Nerbon at the fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>This Armod sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Unless changes my fate hard,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I shall fair Ermingerd</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne&#146;er meet again;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many nurseth for that noble maiden his pain;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Were I not blessed in slumbering ---</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#145;Twere luck past all numbering ---</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One night by her side;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fairest of faces hath surely that bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oddi the little sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;We are scarcely, as I ween,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Worthy of fair Ermingerd;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well I know that noble crown-land</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
May be called the king of queens;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For it well befits that goddess</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the ringfield&#146;s fire to find</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A better husband altogether;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
May she live blest &#145;neath seat of sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>92.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They fared till they came west to
Galicialand in the winter before Yule, and meant to sit there Yule over.&nbsp;
They dealt with the landsmen and begged them to set them a market to buy
food;&nbsp; for the land was barren and bad for food;&nbsp; for the land was
barren and bad for food, and the landsmen thought it hard to feed that host of
men.&nbsp; Now these tidings had happened there, that in that land sat a chief,
who was a stranger, in a castle, and he had laid on the landsmen very heavy
burdens.&nbsp; He harried them on the spot if they did not agree at once to all
that he asked, and he offered them the greatest tyranny and oppression.&nbsp;
And when the earl spoke to the landsmen about bringing him food to buy, they
made him that offer, that they would set them up a market thenceforth on till
Lent, but they must rid them in some way or other of the men in the
castle;&nbsp; but earl Rognvald was to bear the brunt in return for the right
of having all the goods that were gotten from them.&nbsp; The earl laid this
bare before his men, and sought counsel from them as to which choice he should
take, but most of them were eager to fall on the castlemen, and thought it bid
fair for spoil.&nbsp; And so earl Rognvald and his host went into that
agreement with the landsmen.&nbsp; But when it drew near to Yule, earl Rognvald
called his men to a talk and said:&nbsp; &#8220;Now have we sat here awhile, and yet
we have had nothing to do with the castlemen, but the landsmen are getting
rather slack in their dealings with us;&nbsp; methinks they think that what we
promised them will have no fulfilment;&nbsp; but still that is not manly not to
turn our hands to what we have promised.&nbsp; Now, kinsman Erling will I take
counsel from you in what way we shall win the castle, for I know that ye are here
some of you the greatest men for good counsel;&nbsp; but still I will beg all
those men who are here that each will throw in what [he thinks] is likeliest to
be worth trying.&#8221;&nbsp; Erling answered the earl&#146;s speech:&nbsp; &#8220;I will not be
silent at your bidding, but I am not a man for counsel;&nbsp; and it would be
better rather to call on those men for that who have seen more, and are more
wont to such exploits, as is Eindrid the young.&nbsp; But here it will be as
the saying goes, &#145;You must shoot at a bird before you get him.&#146;&nbsp; And so we
will try to give some counsel whatever comes of it.&nbsp; We shall today, if it
seems to you not bad counsel or to the other shipmasters, go all of us to the
wood, and bear each of us three shoulder-bundles of faggots on our backs under
the castle;&nbsp; for it seems to me as though the lime will not be trusty if a
great fire is brought to it.&nbsp; We shall let this go on for the three next
days and see what turn things take.&#8221;&nbsp; They did as Erling bade.&nbsp; And
when that toil was over, it was come right on to Yule.&nbsp; The bishop would
not let them make their onslaught while the Yule high feast stood over them.</p>

<p>That chief&#146;s name was Godfrey who dwelt in the castle;&nbsp; he was a wise
man and somewhat stricken in years.&nbsp; He was a good clerk, and had fared
far and wide, and knew many tongues.&nbsp; He was a grasping man and a very
unfair man.&nbsp; He calls together his men when he saw their [Rognvald&#146;s]
undertakings, and said to them:&nbsp; &#8220;This scheme seems to me clever and
harmful to us which the Northmen have taken in hand;&nbsp; it will befall us thus
if fire is borne against us, that the stone wall round the castle will be
untrusty, but the Northmen are strong and brave;&nbsp; we shall have to look
for a sharp fight from them if they get a chance.&nbsp; I will now take counsel
with you what shall be done in this strait which has befallen us.&#8221;&nbsp; But
his men all bade him see to that for them.&nbsp; Then he began to speak, and
said:&nbsp; &#8220;My first counsel is that ye shall bind a cord round me and let me
slide down the castle wall tonight.&nbsp; I shall have on bad clothes and fare
into the camp of the Northmen, and know what I can find out.&#8221;&nbsp; This
counsel was taken as he had laid it down.&nbsp; And when Godfrey came to earl
Rognvald, and said he was an old beggar carle, and spoke in Spanish;&nbsp; they
understood that tongue best.&nbsp; He fared about among all the booths and
begged for food.&nbsp; He found out that there was great envy and splitting
into parties amongst the Northmen.&nbsp; Eindrid was the head of one side, but
the earl of the other.&nbsp; Godfrey came to Eindrid and got to talk with him,
and brought that before him that the chief who held the castle had sent him
thither.&nbsp; &#8220;He will have fellowship with thee, and he hopes that thou wilt
give him peace if the caste be won;&nbsp; he would rather that thou shouldst
have his treasures, if thou wilt do so much in return for them, than those who
would rather see him a dead man.&#8221;&nbsp; Of such things they talked and much
besides.&nbsp; But the earl was kept in the dark;&nbsp; all this went on by
stealth at first.&nbsp; And when Godfrey had stayed a while with the earl&#146;s
men, then he turned back to his men.&nbsp; But this was why they did not flit
what they owned out of the castle, because they did not know whether the storm
would take place at all;&nbsp; besides they could not trust the landfolk.</p>

<p>93.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the tenth day of Yule that
earl Rognvald rose up.&nbsp; The weather was good.&nbsp; Then he bade his men
put on their arms, and let the host be called up to the castle with the
trumpet.&nbsp; Then they drew the wood towards it, and piled a bale (5) round
about the wall;&nbsp; the earl drew up his men for the onslaught where each of
them should go.&nbsp; The earl goes against it from the south with the
Orkneyingers;&nbsp; Erling and Aslak from the west;&nbsp; John and Gudorm from
the east;&nbsp; Eindrid the young from the north, with his followers.&nbsp; And
when they were boun for the storm they cast fire into the bale.&nbsp; Then the
earl sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Ermingerd&#146;s white handmaid bore</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wine to men, the goddess bright</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of driven snow, so fair she seemed</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To my vision when we met;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now the warrior band resolves</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To rush onward and attack</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Castle-garrison with fire;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sharp-swords spring from out the sheaths.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now they begin to press on fast both with fire and weapons.&nbsp; Then they
shot hard into the work, for they could not reach them by any other
attack.&nbsp; The castlemen stood loosely here and there on the wall, for they
had to guard themselves against the shots.&nbsp; They poured out too burning
pitch and brimstone, and the earl&#146;s men took little harm by that.&nbsp; Now it
turned out, as Erling had guessed, that the castle wall crumbled before the
fire when the lime would not stand it, and there were great breaches in
it.&nbsp; Sigmund angle was the name of a man in the earl&#146;s body-guard;&nbsp;
he was Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son&#146;s stepson;&nbsp; he pressed on faster than any man to
the castle, and ever went on before the earl;&nbsp; he was then scarcely grown
up.&nbsp; And when the storm had lasted awhile, then all men fled from the
castle wall.&nbsp; The wind was on from the south, and the reek of the smoke
lay towards Eindrid and his men.&nbsp; And when the fire began to spread very
fast, then the earl made them bring water, and cool the rubble that was
burned.&nbsp; And then there was a lull in the assault. (6)&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald
sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Aye shall I that Yule remember,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Warrior!&nbsp; which we spent at Agdir,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
East among the fells with Solmund,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Steward strong of Norway&#146;s king;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now again at that same season</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of another year as then</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stunning din of swords I make</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the castle&#146;s southern verge.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again he sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Well pleased was I when the wine-tree (7)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Listened to my winning words;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Past all hope then was I given</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At harvest to the foreign maid;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now again I sate the eagles,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since full well we love the girl</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nobly born;&nbsp; and now the freestone</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Set in mortar must give way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Sigmund angle sang this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Bear these words back when the spring comes</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the goddess needle-plying,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wearing gems from fell-side won,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bear them o&#146;er the sea to Orkney;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That no warrior, though he were</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wight of elder years, went farther</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forward &#145;neath the castle walls,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When strokes sung high at early morn.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that the earl made ready to storm, and Sigmund angle with him.&nbsp; There
was then but a little struggle, and they got into the castle.&nbsp; There many
men were slain, but those who would take life gave themselves up to the earl&#146;s
power.&nbsp; There they took much goods, but they did not find the chief, and
scarcely any precious things.&nbsp; Then there was forthwith much talk how
Godfrey could have got away;&nbsp; and then at once they had the greatest doubt
of Eindrid the young, that he must have passed him away somehow, and that he
[Godfrey] must have gone away under the smoke to the wood.</p>

<p>After that earl Rognvald and his host stayed there a short time in
Galicialand, and held on west off Spain.&nbsp; They harried wide in that part
of Spain which belonged to the heathen, and got there much goods.&nbsp; They
ran up into a thorpe there, as the earl told them.&nbsp; But those who dwelt in
the thorpe ran together and made ready to battle;&nbsp; then there was a hard
struggle, and the landfolk fled at last, but many were slain.&nbsp; Then the
earl sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Lady-meeting now I long for;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Out away in Spain was driven</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Foe in speedy flight, and many</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ring-trees (8) panting rushed before me;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We were worthy Ermingerda,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For that then sweet songs were chaunted</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In our praises to the people;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Corses covered all the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that they sailed west off Spain, and got there a great storm, and lay
three days at anchor, so that they shipped very much water, and it lay near
that they had lost their ships.&nbsp; Then the earl sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Cool fields goddess! (9) never shall I</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Free afraid in wintry storm</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If along the good ship&#146;s sides</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hemp and cable do not snap;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the white-hued clad in linen,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To lady proud my word when sailing</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
South I gave;&nbsp; and now the wind</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To the Sound soon bears my ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that they hoisted their sails, and beat out to Njorfa Sound (10) with
a very cross wind. (11)&nbsp; Then Oddi the little sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Hearty friend of men, who drinketh</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mead
in-doors, hath often spent</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Seven much more cheerful days</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the captain of the sound-tree; (12)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But today the high-souled Rognvald,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With his band of shielded men,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On his bright-hued wooden horse</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ran for Njorvi&#146;s narrow Sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as they were just beating into the Sound, the earl sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Eastern wind hath borne along</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our ships at winter-tide</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Far from the French lady&#146;s hands;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Come, run out our boom to tack;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We shall have to gird our sea-stag</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Half-mast high off Spain today;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soon to Svidrir&#146;s stormy Sound,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Speeds the gale our ships along.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sailed through Njorfa Sound, and then the weather began to get
better.&nbsp; And then as they bore out of the Sound, Eindrid the younger
parted company from the earl with six ships.&nbsp; He sailed over the sea to
Marseilles, but Rognvald and his ships lay behind at the Sound, and men talked
much about it, how Eindrid helped Godfrey away.&nbsp; Then the earl made them
hoist their sails;&nbsp; they sailed on the main, and steered a south course
along Sarkland. (13)&nbsp; Then Rognvald sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;North away the land still trends,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brave ship spares not now the wave,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nor shall now this man be slow</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To break out in burst of song;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This soft belt of earth (14) I cut</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Off the Spanish shore today;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thin
keel, this hateful bight</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To a lazy longshoreman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing is told of the voyage of the earl and his men before they came south
off Sarkland, and lay in the neighbourhood of Sardinia, and knew not what land
they were near.&nbsp; The weather had turned out in this wise, that a great
calm set in and mists and smooth seas --- though the nights were light --- and
they saw scarcely at all from their ships, and so they made little way.&nbsp;
One morning it happened that the mist lifted.&nbsp; Men stood up and looked
about them.&nbsp; Then the earl asked if men saw anything new.&nbsp; They said
they saw naught but two islets, little and steep;&nbsp; and when they looked
for the islets the second time, then one of the islets was gone.&nbsp; They
told this to the earl;&nbsp; he began to say:&nbsp; &#8220;That can have been no
islets, that must be ships which men have out here in this part of the world,
which they call Dromonds; (15)&nbsp; those are ships big as holms to look
on.&nbsp; But there where the other Dromond lay a breeze must have come down on
the sea, and they must have sailed away, but these must be wayfaring men,
either chapmen or faring in some other way on their business.&#8221;&nbsp; After that
the earl lets them call to him the bishop and all the shipmasters;&nbsp; then
he began to say:&nbsp; &#8220;I call you together for this, lord bishop and Erling my
kinsman;&nbsp; see ye any scheme or chance of ours that we may win victory in
some way over those who are on the Dromond.&#8221;&nbsp; The bishop answers:&nbsp;
&#8220;Hard, I guess, will it be for you to run your longships under the Dromond, for
ye will have no better way of boarding than by grappling the bulwarks with a
broad axe, but they will have brimstone and boiling pitch to throw under your
feet and over your heads.&nbsp; Ye may see, earl, so wise as ye are, that it is
the greatest rashness to lay one&#146;s self and one&#146;s men in such risk.&#8221;&nbsp; Then
Erling began to speak:&nbsp; &#8220;Lord bishop,&#8221; he says, &#8220;likely it is that ye are best
able to see this that there will be little hope of victory in rowing against
them.&nbsp; But somehow it seems to me that though we try to run under the
Dromond, so methinks it will be that the greatest weight of weapons will fall
beyond our ships, if we hug her close, broadside to broadside.&nbsp; But if it
be not so, then we can put off from them quickly, for they will not chase us in
the Dromond.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl began to say:&nbsp; &#8220;That is spoken like a man and
quite to my mind.&nbsp; I will now make that clear to the shipmasters and all
the crews, that each man shall busk him in his room, and arm himself as he best
can.&nbsp; After that we will row up to them.&nbsp; But if they are Christian
chapmen, then it will be in our power to make peace with them;&nbsp; but if
they are heathen, as I feel sure they are, then Almighty God will yield us that
mercy that we shall win the victory over him.&nbsp; But of the war-spoil which
we get there, we shall give the fiftieth penny to poor men.&#8221;&nbsp; After that
men got out their arms and heightened the bulwarks of their ships, and made
themselves ready according to the means which they had at hand.&nbsp; The earl
settles where each of his ships should run in.&nbsp; Then they made an
onslaught on her by rowing, and pulled up to her as briskly as they could.</p>

<p>94.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when those who were on board the
Dromond saw that ships were rowing up to them, and that men meant to make an
onslaught on them, they took silken stuffs and costly goods and hung them out
on the bulwarks, and then made great shoutings and hailings;&nbsp; and it seemed
to the earl&#146;s men as though they dared the Northmen to come on against
them.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald laid his ship aft alongside the Dromond on the
starboard, but Erling aft too on the larboard.&nbsp; John and Aslak, they laid
their ships foreward each on his own board, but the others amidships on both
boards, and all the ships hugged her close, broadside to broadside.&nbsp; And
when they came under the Dromond, her sides were so high out of the water that
they could not reach up with their weapons.&nbsp; But they [the foe] poured
down blazing brimstone and flaming pitch over them.&nbsp; And it was as Erling
guessed it would be, that the greatest weight of weapons fell out beyond the
ships, and they had no need to shield themselves on that side which was next to
the Dromond, but those who were on the other side held their shields over their
heads and sheltered themselves in that way.&nbsp; And when they made no way
with their onslaught, the bishop shoved his ship off and two othes, and they
picked out and sent thither their bowmen, and they law within shot, and shot
thence at the Dromond, and then that onslaught was the hardest that was
made.&nbsp; Then those [on board the Dromond] got under cover, but thought
little about what those were doing who had laid their ships under the Dromond.&nbsp;
Earl Rognvald called out then to his men that they should take their axes and
hew asunder the broadside of the Dromond in the parts where she was least
iron-bound.&nbsp; But when the men in the other ships saw what the earls men
were about, they also took the like counsel.&nbsp; Now where Erling and his men
had laid their ship a great anchor hung on the Dromond, and the fluke was hung
by the crook over the bulwark, but the stock pointed down to Erling&#146;s
ship.&nbsp; Audun the red was the name of Erling&#146;s bowman;&nbsp; he was lifted
up on the anchor-stock.&nbsp; But after that he hauled up to him more men, so
that they stood as thick as every they could on the stock, and thence hewed at
the sides as they best could, and that hewing was by far the highest up.&nbsp;
And when they had hewn such large doors that they could go into the Dromond,
they made ready to board, and the earl and his men got into the lower hold, but
Erling and his men into the upper.&nbsp; And when both their bands had come up
on the ship, there was a fight both great and hard.&nbsp; On board the Dromond
were Saracens, what we call Mahomet's unbelievers.&nbsp; There were many
blackamoors, and they made the hardest struggle.&nbsp; Erling got there a great
wound on his neck near his shoulders as he sprang up into the Dromond.&nbsp;
That healed so ill, that he bore his head on one side ever after.&nbsp; That
was why he was called wryneck.&nbsp; And when they met, earl Rognvald and
Erling, the Saracens gave way before them to the forepart of the ship, but the
earl&#146;s men then boarded her one after another.&nbsp; Then they were more
numerous, and they pressed the enemy hard.&nbsp; They saw that on board the
Dromond was that one man who was both taller and fairer than the others;&nbsp;
the Northmen held it to be the truth that that man must be their chief. Earl
Rognvald said that they should not turn their weapons against him, if they
could take him in any other way.&nbsp; Then they hemmed him in and bore him
down with their shields, and so he was taken, and afterwards carried to the
bishop&#146;s ship, and few men with him.&nbsp; They slew there much folk, (16) and
got much goods and many costly things.&nbsp; When they had ended the greatest
part of their toil, they sat down and rested themselves.&nbsp; Then the earl
sang this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Famous in victorious glory,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Erling, brave in battle, went</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#145;Gainst the galleon, tree of spears, (17)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When our banners dripped with blood;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Low we laid the swarthy champions,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Blood of foemen then was shed</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Far and wide, and soldiers brave</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Died their keen-edged faulchions red.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again he sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;We make up our minds to win</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The galleon, slaughter this I call;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At early dawn the warrior crew</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reddened all their blades with gore;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
North and from the north the lady</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of this shower of spears will hear</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Up to Nerbon;&nbsp; from our people</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Foemen loathsome life-loss bore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Men spoke of these tidings which had happened there.&nbsp; Then each spoke
of what he thought he had seen;&nbsp; and men talked about who had been the
first to board the Dromond, and could not agree about it.&nbsp; Then some said
that it was foolish that they should not all have one story about these great
tidings;&nbsp; and the end of it was that they agreed that earl Rognvald should
settle the dispute;&nbsp; and afterwards they should all back what he
said.&nbsp; Then the earl sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;First upon the gloomy galleon</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ruddy Audun went with eager</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Daring, and the warrior dauntless</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Swift dashed on to seize the spoil;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There at last we reached to redden</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Weapons in our foeman&#146;s blood;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mankind&#146;s God hath ruled it so;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the planks fell corses black.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had stripped the Dromond, they put tire into her and burnt
her.&nbsp; And when that tall man whom they had made captive saw that, he was
much stirred and changed colour, and could not hold himself still.&nbsp; But
though they tried to make him speak, he said never a word, and made no manner
of sign, nor did he pay any heed to them whether they promised him good or
ill.&nbsp; But when the Dromond began to blaze, they saw as though blazing molten
ore ran down into the sea.&nbsp; That moved the captive man much.&nbsp; They
were quite sure then that they had looked for goods carelessly, and now the
metal had melted in the heat of the fire, whether it had been gold or
silver.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald and his men sailed thence south under Sarkland, and
lay under a sea-burg, and made a seven nights&#146; truce with the townsmen, and had
dealings with them, and sold them the men whom they had taken.&nbsp; No man
would buy the tall man.&nbsp; And after that the earl gave him leave to go
away, and four men with him.&nbsp; He came down the next morning with a train
of men, and told them that he was a prince of Sarkland, and had sailed thence
with the Dromond and all the goods that were aboard her.&nbsp; He said too he
thought that worst of all that they burnt the Dromond, and made such waste of
that great wealth, that it was of no use to any one.&nbsp; &#8220;But now I have
great power over your affairs.&nbsp; Now ye shall have the greatest good from
me for having spared my life, and treated me with such honour as ye
could;&nbsp; but I would be very willing that we saw each other never
again.&nbsp; And so now live safe and sound and well.&#8221;&nbsp; After that he rode
up the country, but earl Rognvald sailed thence south to Crete, and they lay
there in very foul weather.&nbsp; Then Armod sang a song when he kept watch at
night on board the earl&#146;s ship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;On the keel-horse we keep watch,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where below the stiff ribs dashes</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wave on wave;&nbsp; this weary work</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have we here to win till morning;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
O&#146;er my shoulder now I look</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Back on Crete, while milksop soft</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sleeps to night with sleek-skinned maiden, </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Kind in her close-fitting smock.&#8221;</p>

<p>95.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earl and his men lay under Crete
till they got a fair wind for Jewry-land, and came to Acreburg early on a
Friday morning, and landed then with such great pomp and state as was seldom
seen there.&nbsp; Thorbjorn the swarthy then made a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;In the Orkneys for a winter</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was I serving with the chief;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Feeder of the bird of battle</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First arose to strive in fight;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now the shield on Friday morning</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here we bear with eager haste,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the earl in battle proven,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In watery port of Acre town.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl and his men stayed in Acreburg a while.&nbsp; There sickness came
into their ranks, and many famous men breathed their last.&nbsp; There
Thorbjorn the swarthy a liegeman breathed his last.&nbsp; Oddi the little sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Barks of chieftains</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thorbjorn bore,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Swarthy of hue,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By Thrasness swift;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Under the best of skalds</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Woodbear (18) trode</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ati&#146;s acres</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To Acreburg.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then saw I him,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hero&#146;s friend,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sprinkled with mould</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In mother church;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now the soil stony,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By sunbeam blest,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lies heavy o&#146;er him</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In southern land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Earl Rognvald and his men then fared from Acreburg, and sought all the
holiest places in the land of Jewry.&nbsp; They all fared to Jordan and bathed
there.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald and Sigmund angle swam across the river, and went up
on the bank there, and thither where was a thicket of brushwood, and there they
twisted great knots.&nbsp; Then the earl sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;For the men a coil I twisted</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of the way-thong on the heath,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Out on Jordan&#146;s further bank;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clever woman this will learn;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But I trow that it will seem</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Long to go so far as this</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To all lazy stay-at-homes;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On wide field the blood falls warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Sigmund sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;I will wreathe another knot</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the sloth who sits at home;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sooth to say that we have set</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For his child a snare today.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;To the coward here we twine</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the thicket close a knot,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On this feast of holy Laurence;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tired to quarters good I came.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that they fared back to Jerusalem.&nbsp; And when they came close to
the city, then earl Rognvald sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;At this bard&#146;s breast hangs a cross,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Twixt his shoulder-blades a palm;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pride of heart shall be laid low;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soldiers scale the cliffs in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>96.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Rognvald and his men fared that
summer from the land of Jewry, and meant to go north to Micklegarth, and came
about autumn to that town which is called Imbolar. (19)&nbsp; They stayed there
a very long time in the town.&nbsp; They had that watchword in the town if men
met one another walking where it was throng and narrow, and the one thought it
needful that the other who met him should yield him the path, then he says
thus:&nbsp; &#8220;Out of the way,&#8221; &#8220;Out of the way.&#8221;&nbsp; One evening as the earl
and his men were coming out of the town, and Erling wryneck went out along the
whart to his ship, some of the townsmen met him and called out, &#8220;Out of the
way,&#8221; &#8220;Out of the way.&#8221;&nbsp; Erling was very drunk, and made as though he
heard them not, and when they ran against one another, Erling fell off the
wharf, and down into the mud which was below, and his men ran down to pick him
up, and had to strip off every stitch of his clothes, and wash him.&nbsp; Next
morning when he and the earl met, and he was told what had happened, he smiled
at it and sang:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220; &#145;Mid-street&#146; my friend would not call</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So he had in filth to fall </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Head and heels, and thus in that</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Great misfortune nearly followed;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then I trow the king&#146;s own cousin</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Little comely looked when rolling</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
midst the mud in Imbolar;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To his breeks the blue clay clung.&#8221;</p>

<p>These tidings happened a little while after there in the town, when they
came out of the town very drunk that John limpleg&#146;s men missed him, but no man
else.&nbsp; They sent at once to look for him on board the other ships that
night, and he could not be found, but they could not look for him upon the land
in the night.&nbsp; But next morning they rose up as soon as ever it was light,
and found him a little way from the burg-wall, and he had breathed his last,
and they found wounds on him.&nbsp; But it was never known who had given him
his hurt.&nbsp; Then they bestowed burial on his body, and found him a grave at
the church.&nbsp; After that they fared away thence.&nbsp; And nothing is told
of their voyage before they come north to Engilsness [Cape St. Angelo].&nbsp;
There they lay some nights and waited for a wind which would seem fair to them
to sail north along the sea to Micklegarth.&nbsp; They took great pains then
with their sailing, and so sailed with great pomp just as they had heard that
Sigurd Jewryfarer had done.&nbsp; And as they sailed north along the sea, earl
Rognvald sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Let us ride on Refil&#146;s steed (20)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Out to Micklegarth with speed;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the field draw not the plough,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ear the main with dripping prow;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take we bounty of the king,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Push we on while weapons ring,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Redden maw of wolf with gore,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mighty monarch bow before.&#8221;</p>

<p>97.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When earl Rognvald and his men
came to Micklegarth, they had a hearty welcome from the emperor and the
Varangians.&nbsp; Menelaus was then emperor over Micklegarth, whom we call
Manuel;&nbsp; he gave the earl much goods, and offered them bounty-money if
they would stay there.&nbsp; They stayed there awhile that winter in very good
cheer.&nbsp; There was Eindrid the young, and he had very great honour from the
emperor.&nbsp; He had little to do with earl Rognvald and his men, and rather
tried to set other men against them.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald set out on his voyage
home that winter from Micklegarth, and fared first west to Bulgaria-land to
Dyrrachburg. (21)&nbsp; Thence he sailed west across the sea to Poule.
(22)&nbsp; There earl Rognvald and bishop William and Erling and all the nobler
men of their band landed from their ships, and got them horses, and rode thence
first to Rome, and so homewards on the way from Rome until they come to
Denmark, and thence they fared north to Norway.&nbsp; There men were glad to
see them, and this voyage was most famous, and they who had gone on it were
thought to be men of much more worth after than before.&nbsp; While they had
been on their travels Ogmund the gallant, Erling wryneck&#146;s brother had
died;&nbsp; he was thought of most worth of those brothers while they were both
alive.&nbsp; Erling threw in his lot at once with king Ingi, because he leant
most to him of those brothers in all friendship, and they never parted so long
as they both lived.</p>

<p>But after king Ingi&#146;s fall Magnus was chosen to be king over that band, the
son of Erling and Kristina, daughter of king Sigurd Jewryfarer;&nbsp; but
Erling alone had then the whole rule over the land in Norway.&nbsp; Waldemar
the Dane-king gave Erling the title of earl;&nbsp; he became the greatest man
after that, and a mighty chief, as is written in his saga.&nbsp; Eindrid the
young came from abroad some winters later than earl Rognvald and his men, and
he threw in his lot then with king Eystein, for he would have nothing to do
with Erling.&nbsp; But after the fall of king Eystein, these, Eindrid the young
and Sigurd son of Havard the freeman of Reyrir, got together a band, and chose
as king Hacon broadshoulders, son of king Sigurd Harold&#146;s son.&nbsp; They slew
Gregory Dag&#146;s son and king Ingi.&nbsp; Those two, Eindrid and Hacon, fought
with Erling wryneck under Sekk;&nbsp; there Hacon fell but Eindrid fled.&nbsp;
Earl Erling let Eindrid the young be slain sometime after away east in the Bay.</p>

<p>98.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Rognvald stayed a very long
time in Hordaland that summer when he came into the land, and heard then many
tidings out of the Orkneys.&nbsp; It was told him that there was great strife,
and the chieftains had gone into two bands, but there were few who sat by so
that they had no share in the strife.&nbsp; Earl Harold was on one side, but on
the other earl Erlend and Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son.&nbsp; And when the earl heard
that said, he sang this song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Now the princes of the people</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have gone back on many an oath;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That is blasphemy &#145;gainst God;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Men&#146;s ill redes now come to light;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But this evil will not lessen</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In those who guile devise at home;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So let us on lissom leg</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Step light so long as beard will wag.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earl had no ships at his command.&nbsp; Then he looked to his kinsfolk
and friends that they should get him some longships made that winter.&nbsp;
They took that well upon them, and granted him in that matter just what he
asked.&nbsp; The earl busked him that summer to fare west into the Orkneys to
his realm, and he was very late boun, for he lingered much.&nbsp; He fared west
on board that trading-ship which Thorhall Asgrim&#146;s son owned;&nbsp; he was an
Icelander, and of great kindred, and had a house south at Bishopstongues.&nbsp;
The earl had for all that a great train on board the ship and a noble band of
companions.&nbsp; They made Scotland when the winter was far spent, and long
lay off Scotland under Turfness.&nbsp; The earl came a little before Yule into
the Orkney to his realm.</p>

<p>99.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now shall be told what tidings
happened in the Orkneys while earl Rognvald was abroad on his travels.</p>

<p>That same summer that the earl had fared away from the land, came east from
Norway king Eystein son of Harold Gilli;&nbsp; he had a great host.&nbsp; And
when he came into the Orkneys he steered with his host for South
Ronaldshay.&nbsp; Then he heard that earl Harold Maddad&#146;s son had fared over to
Caithness with a twenty-benched ship, and had eighty men with him;&nbsp; he lay
in Thurso.&nbsp; But when king Eystein heard of him, he manned three cutters
and fared west over the Pentland-firth, and so to Thurso.&nbsp; He came there
so that the earl and his men were not ware of it before the king&#146;s men boarded
their ship and made the earl captive.&nbsp; He was led before the king, and
their dealings turned out so, that the earl ransomed himself with three marks
of gold, but his realm he gave over into king Eystein&#146;s hands, so that he was
to hold it of him ever after.&nbsp; Then the earl became king Eystein&#146;s man,
and bound that with oaths.&nbsp; And after that king Eystein fared to Scotland,
and harried there that summer.&nbsp; He harried far and wide too round England
on that voyage, and he was thought to aveng king Harold Sigurd&#146;s son.&nbsp;
After that king Eystein fared east into his realm to Norway, and very various
stories were told of his doings.&nbsp; Earl Harold stayed behind in the Orkneys
in his realm, and he was in good favour with most men.&nbsp; Earl Maddad his
father was then dead, but his mother Margaret had come out into the
Orkneys.&nbsp; She was a fair woman and very proud and haughty.&nbsp; At that
time David the Scot-king died, and Malcolm his grandson (23) was taken to be
king;&nbsp; he was a child in years when he took the realm.</p>

<p>100.&nbsp; Erlend, son of Harold smooth-tongue, was most of his time in
Thurso, but sometimes he was in the Southern isles, or a-roving after earl
Ottar was dead.&nbsp; He was the most promising man, and thoroughly trained and
skilled in most things, bountiful of money, blithe and ready to listen to good
advice, and of all men most beloved by his followers.&nbsp; He had a great
train.&nbsp; Anakol was the name of a man, he was Erlend&#146;s fosterer, and had
most weight in his counsels.&nbsp; Anakol was a viking and a man of good birth
and great hardihood, a Southislander by kin;&nbsp; he was Erlend&#146;s counsellor.</p>

<p>When Erlend heard that earl Rognvald was gone away from his realm abroad to
Jerusalem, he went to him to give him the title of earl and Caithness as a
lordship, as his father Harold had held it from king David, king Malcolm&#146;s
grandfather.&nbsp; King Malcolm was then a child in years, but for that Erlend
had there many noble kinsfolk who backed his cause, it came about that the
Scot-king gave Erlend the title of earl, and granted him half Caithness with
his kinsman Harold.&nbsp; Then Erlend fared to Caithness and met his friends
there.&nbsp; After that he gathered force to himself and fared out into the
Orkneys.&nbsp; There he bade them do homage to him, but earl Harold Maddad&#146;s
son got a force together at once, when he heard of Erlend, and had many men on
his side.&nbsp; Then men went between those kinsman, and tried to set them at
one.&nbsp; Erlend asked for half the isles with Harold, but he will not give
them up, and the end of it was that peace was fixed for that year.&nbsp; But
the plan was that Erlend shall fare east into Norway to find king Eystein and
ask for that half which earl Rognvald owned, and then Harold said he would give
it up.&nbsp; Then Erlend fared east into Norway, but Anakol and some of his
train were behind in the Orkneys.&nbsp; Gunni Olaf&#146;s son, Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son&#146;s
brother, had got a child by Margaret earl Harold&#146;s mother, but the earl made
him an outlaw.&nbsp; From that unfriendliness sprung up between Sweyn and earl
Harold, and Sweyn sent Gunni south into the Lewes to his friend Ljotolf, with
whom Sweyn had been before.&nbsp; Fogl was the name of Ljotolf&#146;s son;&nbsp; he
was with earl Harold, and he and Sweyn had little to say to one another.&nbsp;
When earl Erlend fared east to Norway, earl Harold fared over to Caithness, and
sat that winter in Wick.&nbsp; Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son was then in Thraswick in
Caithness, and had under his charge the farms of his stepsons.&nbsp; He had
first to wife Ragnhild Ogmund&#146;s daughter;&nbsp; they were but a short while
together.&nbsp; Olaf was their son.&nbsp; After that he had to wife Ingirid
Thorkel&#146;s daughter.&nbsp; Andrew was their son.&nbsp; It was on Wednesday in
Passion week that Sweyn had gone up into Lambaburg with some men.&nbsp; They
saw where a ship of burden fared from the east off the Pentland firth, and
Sweyn thought he knew that there must be earl Harold&#146;s men, whom he had sent
after his scatts to Shetland.&nbsp; Sweyn bade his men go on board ship, and
pull out to the ship of burden, and so they did.&nbsp; They took the ship of
burden and all that was worth anything, but shoved earl Harold&#146;s men ashore,
and they went east to Wick and told him.&nbsp; Earl Harold said little in
answer, and says that he and Sweyn would take it by turns to have each other&#146;s
goods, and he quartered his men about at different houses during Easter.&nbsp;
Then the Caithness men said that the earl was on his visitations.&nbsp; But as
soon as ever Easter was over, Sweyn fared away with the ship of burden and a
rowing cutter to the Orkneys.&nbsp; And when they came to Scapa-neck, they took
there a ship from Fogl Ljotolf&#146;s son;&nbsp; he was then come from the south out
of the Lewes from his father, and meant to go to earl Harold.&nbsp; And in that
trip they took about twelve ounces of gold from Sigurd cloven-foot, earl
Harold&#146;s house-carle;&nbsp; that money had been brought into his house, but
they were in Kirkwall who owned it.&nbsp; After that Sweyn fared over to the
Ness and up into Scotland, and found Malcolm the Scot-king at Aberdeen.&nbsp;
He was then nine winters old. (24)&nbsp; There Sweyn was a month in very good
cheer, and the Scot-king bade him take all those rights and easements in
Caithness which he had owned ere he fell out with earl Harold.&nbsp; Sweyn
thanked the king.&nbsp; After that Sweyn busked him to go away, and he and the Scot-king
parted with great love.&nbsp; Then Sweyn fared to his ships, and sailed from
the south to the Orkneys.&nbsp; Anakol was then in Deerness when Sweyn and his
men sailed from the south, and they saw his sails off the east side of the
Mull.&nbsp; They sent to Sweyn and his men Gauti the Master of
Skeggbjornsstead, and Anakol begged that Sweyn would come to terms with Fogl
about taking the ship, for there was kinship between them, and Fogl was then
with Anakol.&nbsp; But when Gauti found Sweyn and his men, and told him Anakol&#146;s
words, then Sweyn bade them sail to Sanday and meet him there, for he said he
must sail thither at once.&nbsp; There was a very numerous meeting there to
make matters up, and the atonement was only brought about slowly.&nbsp; But the
end of it was that Sweyn alone was to make what award he chose.&nbsp; After
that Anakol threw in his force with Sweyn, and they bound themselves to try to
bring about an atonement between him and earl Erlend when he came from the
east, for there was feud between them for the burning of Frakok.&nbsp; Sweyn
and Anakol fared to Stronsay, and lay by Hofsness some nights.&nbsp; Thorfinn
Brusi&#146;s son then dwelt in Stronsay;&nbsp; he had then to wife Ingigerd Sweyn&#146;s
sister, whom Thorbjorn clerk had left to herself.&nbsp; When Sweyn and Anakol
lay by Hofsness, earl Erlend sailed up from off the main, and Anakol and
Thorfinn Brusi&#146;s son fared out at once to meet him, and tried to bring about an
atonement between him and Sweyn, and the earl took the offer of atonement
heavily, and said Sweyn had always gone against the stream towards his kinsfolk
and himself, but not kept to what he [Sweyn] and earl Ottar had settled as to
lending him [Erlend] strength to get the realm for himself. (25)&nbsp; Then
Sweyn offered to the earl his following and counsel, and they were trying to
bring the atonement about all day, but it was not brought about before they
both of them, Anakol and Thorfinn, gave out that they would follow Sweyn out of
the islands if the earl would not be atoned with him.&nbsp; Earl Erlend brings
back from the east that message from king Eystein, that he should have that lot
of the Orkneys which earl Harold had owned before.&nbsp; Sweyn gave that
counsel, when he and the earl were set at one, that they should fare at once to
find earl Harold ere he heard that of others, and bid him give up the realm to
him.&nbsp; It was done as Sweyn said.&nbsp; They met earl Harold off
Kjarrekstead, (26) and he lay on shipboard.&nbsp; It was on Michaelmas morning
that earl Harold and his men saw that longships were faring up to them, and
they doubted that there would be strife.&nbsp; They ran from their ships and
into the castle that was then there.&nbsp; Arni Hrafn&#146;s son was the name of a
man who ran from earl Harold&#146;s ship and to Kirkwall;&nbsp; he was so scared
that he did not know that he had his shield at his back before he stuck fast in
the church-door.&nbsp; Thorgeirr was the name of a man who was there inside and
saw him Arni&#146;s messmates thought that he was lost, and looked for him two
days.&nbsp; Earl Erlend and Sweyn ran from their ships to the castle after earl
Harold and his men, and attacked them all that day both with fire and
weapons.&nbsp; They made a very stout defence, and the darkness of night parted
them.&nbsp; There many men were wounded on either side, but earl Harold and his
men had surely been worn out and forced to give themselves up to them if the
onslaught had lasted longer.&nbsp; But next morning freemen came up, friends of
both sides, and tried to bring about an atonement between them, and Sweyn and
earl Erlend were loath to make matters up.&nbsp; But still it came about that
they were set at one on these terms, that earl Harold swore oaths that Erlend
should have his&nbsp; (Harold&#146;s), share of the isles, and that he would never
make any claim against him for that realm.&nbsp; These oaths were taken before
many of the best men then in the isles as witnesses, and after that earl Harold
fared over to the Ness, and so on up to Scotland to his kinfolk, then few
Orkneyingers fared with him.&nbsp; Earl Erlend and Sweyn and his companions
summoned a Thing of the freemen in Kirkwall, and the freemen came to it from
all the isles.&nbsp; Earl Erlend pleaded his cause, and so too did many others
of his friends and kinsfolk.&nbsp; Then the earl said that king Eystein had
given him that realm in the Orkneys which earl Harold had before had in his
keeping;&nbsp; then he begged the freemen to do him homage.&nbsp; He had there
with him Eystein&#146;s letters, which proved that he spoke sooth.&nbsp; So it came
about that the freemen yielded obedience to earl Erlend, and then he took under
him all the Orkneys, and made himself chief over them.&nbsp; But it was so
settled between earl Erlend and the freemen, that he should not withhold from
earl Rognvald that half of the realm which he owned, if it were fated that he
should come back.&nbsp; But if earl Rognvald claimed more than half, then the
freemen should hold that against him along with earl Erlend.&nbsp; Sweyn
Asleif&#146;s son was ever with earl Erlend, and bade him be wary, and not trust too
well earl Harold or the Scots.&nbsp; They lay most part of the winter on
shipboard, and kept spies out away from them.&nbsp; But when Yule drew on, and
the weather began to grow hard, then Sweyn fared home to Gairsay to his house,
but bade the earl be not the less wary though they were parted, and so the earl
did, for he lay long on shipboard, and gathered stores together in no one place
for his Yule feast.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>101.&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened on the tenth day of Yule that Sweyn sat in
Gairsay and drank with his house-carles;&nbsp; he began to speak and rubbed his
nose:&nbsp; &#8220;It is my meaning that now earl Harold is on his voyage to the
isles.&#8221;&nbsp; His house-carles say that that were unlikely for the storms&#146; sake
that then lay over them.&nbsp; He said he knew that they would think so.&nbsp;
&#8220;And now,&#8221; says he, &#8220;I will not send the earl news of this for my foreboding
all alone, but I doubt though that there is worse counsel in that.&#8221;&nbsp; So
that talk fell to the ground, and they drank on as before.&nbsp; Earl Harold
began his voyage out to the Orkneys at Yule.&nbsp; He had four ships and one
hundred men;&nbsp; he lay two nights off Grimsay.&nbsp; They landed at Hamnavoe
in Hrossey;&nbsp; thence they went the thirteenth day of Yule to Firth.&nbsp;
They were in Orkahow while a snow-storm drove over them, and there two men of
their band lost their wits and that was a great hindrance to their
journey.&nbsp; It was in the night that they came to Firth;&nbsp; it happened
then that earl Erlend had gone on board his ship, but he had drunk that day up
at the house.&nbsp; Earl Harold and his men slew two men there, and the name of
one of them was Kettle; (1) but they took prisoners four men:&nbsp; Arnfinn
Anakol&#146;s brother, Ljot was the name of the second, and two others.&nbsp; Earl
Harold fared back to Thurso, and Thorbjorn clerk and his men.&nbsp; But those
brothers Benedict and Eric fared to Lambaburg, and had Arnfinn along with
them.&nbsp; At once that very night, as soon as earl Erlend was ware of the
strife, then he sent men to Gairsay to tell Sweyn, and he [Sweyn] made them run
down to his ships to the sea the day after, and fared to find earl Erlend, as
he had sent word, and they were then on shipboard most of the winter.&nbsp;
Benedict and his brother sent that message, that Arnfinn would only be set
loose on those terms, if earl Erlend and his men would let them have that ship
which they had taken off Kjarrekstead.&nbsp; The earl was rather eager that the
ship should be given up;&nbsp; but Anakol set his face against it, and said
that Arnfinn should get away not a whit the less that winter, though that were
not granted.&nbsp; It was on the midweekday (Wednesday) next before the Fast
that they Anakol and Thorstein Ragna&#146;s son, fared over to the Ness with twenty
men in a cutter, and came off the coast in the night.&nbsp; They drew the
cutter into a hidden cove under a certain burg. (2)&nbsp; They go up on shore,
and hide themselves in thickets a short way from the house in Thraswick, but
they dressed up the ship so, that it looked just as if men lay in every
seat.&nbsp; Men had come to the ship in the morning, and had no doubt as to
what she was.&nbsp; Anakol and his men saw men row in a ship away from the burg
and land at the oyce. (3)&nbsp; Then they saw a man too ride out from the burg,
and another walking, and knew it was Eric.&nbsp; Then Anakol and his men parted
their force, and ten of them went to the sea, down the river, and watched that
no one should come to the ship, but the other ten went to the house.&nbsp; Eric
came to the homestead a little before them, and went up to the hall, there he
heard the sound of armed men, and then ran into the hall, and out at the other
door, and wanted to go to the ship, but there the men were in his way, and he
got taken captive there, and was carried out into the isles to earl
Erlend.&nbsp; Then men were sent to earl Harold, and it was told him that Eric
would not be set free till Arnfinn and his companions came safe and sound to
earl Erlend, and that was done as he was told.&nbsp; Next spring earl Harold
busked him from Caithness, and fared north to Shetland;&nbsp; he meant to take
the life of Erlend the young, for he had asked the hand of Margaret the earl&#146;s
mother, but she had refused.&nbsp; After that he got himself a train of
followers, and took her away from the Orkneys, and bore her north to Shetland,
and sat himself down in Moussaburg;&nbsp; there he had laid in great
stores.&nbsp; But when earl Harold came to Shetland, he sat down round the burg
and forbade all supplies, but it is an unhandy place to get at by storm.&nbsp;
Then men came up and tried to bring about an atonement between them.&nbsp; Erlend
asked that the earl should give him the woman in marriage, but offered himself
to strengthen the earl&#146;s hands, and said that it was worth more to him to get
back his realm, but said too that the likeliest way to do that was to make
himself as many friends as he could.&nbsp; That prayer many backed with Erlend,
and this was the end of the matter, that they were set at one, and Erlend got
Margaret, and after that made ready to follow the earl, and they fared that
summer east to Norway.&nbsp; And when that was heard in the Orkneys, then earl
Erlend and his men laid their plans, and Sweyn was eager that they should fare
a sea-roving, and so get money.&nbsp; And so they did, and fared south to
Broadfirth, and harried off the east of Scotland.&nbsp; They fared south to
Berwick. (4)</p>

<p>Canute the wealthy was the name of a man, he was a chapman, and sat very
often in Berwick.&nbsp; Sweyn and his companions took a ship large and good,
which Canute owned, and much goods aboard her;&nbsp; there too his wife was on
board.&nbsp; After that they fared south under Blyholm.&nbsp; Canute was then
in Berwick when he heard of the robbery;&nbsp; he made a bargain with the men
of Berwick for a hundred marks of silver, that they go out to get back the
goods.&nbsp; They were most of them chapmen who went out to look for the
goods.&nbsp; They fared in fourteen ships to look for them.&nbsp; Now when
Erlend and Sweyn lay under Blyholm, Sweyn spoke to them, and told them that men
should lie with no awning over their ships;&nbsp; said he had got it into his
head that the men of Berwick would come in a great company to look them up at
night.&nbsp; But there was a sharp wind on, and men gave no heed to what he
said, and all men lay under their awnings, save that on Sweyn&#146;s ship there was
no awning aft of the mast.&nbsp; Sweyn sat up on the poop in a hairy cloak on a
chest and said he was so boun to spend the night.&nbsp; Einar skew was the name
of a man on board Sweyn&#146;s ship;&nbsp; he spoke and said that far too many
stories had been told of Sweyn&#146;s bravery;&nbsp; &#8220;he is called a better man than
other men, but now he dares not throw an awning over his ship.&#8221;&nbsp; Sweyn
made as though he heard not.&nbsp; There were watchmen upon the holm;&nbsp;
Sweyn heard how they could not agree as to what they saw.&nbsp; He went up to
them and asked about what they strove.&nbsp; They said they could not tell what
they saw.&nbsp; Sweyn was the sharpest-sighted of all men, and when he looked
steadfastly at the spot, he saw that there were fourteen ships coming on them
from the north all together.&nbsp; He went on board his ship and bade the
watchmen go on board the ships and tell what had happened.&nbsp; Sweyn bade his
men wake up and throw off their awnings.&nbsp; After that a great cry arose,
and most men shouted out to Sweyn, and asked what counsel should be
taken;&nbsp; he bade men be still, but said his counsel was to lay their ships
between the holm and the land, &#8220;and try if they will so sail round away from
us;&nbsp; but if that may not be, then let us row against them as hard as we
can.&#8221;&nbsp; But other counsellors spoke against that, and said the only plan
was to sail away, and so it was done.&nbsp; Then Sweyn spoke:&nbsp; &#8220;If ye will
sail away, then beat out to sea.&#8221;&nbsp; Sweyn was last boun.&nbsp; Anakol
waited for him.&nbsp; But when Sweyn&#146;s ship went faster, then he made them
slacken sail, and waited for Anakol, and would not that he should be left
behind with a single ship.&nbsp; Then Einar skew said, as Sweyn and his men
sailed with all sail:&nbsp; &#8220;Sweyn,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is it not so that our ship
stands still?&#8221;&nbsp; Sweyn says:&nbsp; &#8220;I do not think that,&#8221;&nbsp; says he,
&#8220;but I counsel thee that thou speakest no more against my bravery, if thou
canst not tell for fear&#146;s sake whether the ship walks under thee or not, for
this is the fastest of all ships under sail.&#8221;&nbsp; The men of Berwick sailed
south away from them, but Sweyn and his fleet then turned in under the
mainland.&nbsp; And when they came under the Isle of May, then Sweyn sent men
to Edinburgh to tell the Scot-king of the spoil they had taken, but ere they
came to the burg, twelve men rode to meet them, and they had bags full of
silver at their cruppers.&nbsp; And when they met, the Scottish men asked after
Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son;&nbsp; they said where he was, and asked what they wanted of
him.&nbsp; The Scots said that they had been told that Sweyn was taken
prisoner, and the Scot-king had sent them to set him free with that money which
they carried with them.&nbsp; Sweyn&#146;s men told them the news in return, and
fared to find the Scot-king, and told him their errand.&nbsp; The king spoke
lightly of the loss of Canute&#146;s money, and sent Sweyn a costly shield and other
good gifts more.&nbsp; Earl Erlend and Sweyn fared that autumn to the Orkneys
and came back rather late.</p>

<p>That summer earl Harold fared to Norway, as was before told.&nbsp; Then too
earl Rognvald came back from abroad from Micklegarth into Norway, and Erling
wry-neck with him, as was before written.&nbsp; And earl Rognvald came into the
Orkneys a little before Yule.</p>

<p>102. Then men at once came between earl Rognvald and earl Erlend, and tried
to set them at one.&nbsp; Then men brought forward that understanding which had
passed between freemen and earl Erlend, that he should not withhold his share
of the isles from earl Rognvald.&nbsp; Then things came to a fixed meeting
between those earls in Kirkwall, and at that meeting they made matters up and
bound that by oaths.&nbsp; That was two nights before Yule, and the terms of
the settlement were that each of them should have half of the isles, and both
should guard them against earl Harold or any others if they laid claim to
them.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald had then no force of ships before the summer after,
when his ships came from the east out of Norway.&nbsp; That winter all stood
quiet, but in the spring after the earls laid their plans against earl Harold
if he should come from the east, and earl Erlend and Sweyn Asleif&#146;s son fared
to Shetland, and were to lie in wait for him there if he showed himself.&nbsp;
Earl Rognvald fared over to Thurso, for they thought that Harold might make
thither when he came from the east, for he had many kinsfolk and friends
there.&nbsp; Earl Erlend and Sweyn were in Shetland that summer, and stopped
all ships so that no one might go to Norway.&nbsp; Earl Harold fared that
summer from the east out of Norway, and had seven ships;&nbsp; he made the
Orkneys, but three of his ships were driven into Shetland by stress of weather,
and Erlend and Sweyn took them. &nbsp;When earl Harold came into the Orkneys,
there he heard those tidings, that earl Rognvald and earl Erlend were atoned,
and that each of them was to have half the isles.&nbsp; Then earl Harold
thought he saw that as for his choice, nothing was meant for him.&nbsp; Then he
took that counsel to fare over to the Ness at once to find earl Rognvald ere
earl Erlend and Sweyn came back from Shetland.&nbsp; Earl Erlend and Sweyn were
then in Shetland, when they heard that earl Harold was come into the Orkneys
with five ships;&nbsp; they held on south at once into the isles with five
ships,&nbsp; and got caught in Dynrace, (5) in dangerous tides and a storm of
wind, and there they parted company.&nbsp; Then Sweyn bore up for the Fair isle
in two ships, and they thought the earl lost.&nbsp; Thence they held on their
course south under Sanday, and there earl Erlend lay before them with three
ships, and that was a very joyful meeting.&nbsp; Thence they fared to Hrossey,
and heard there that earl Harold had fared over to the Ness.&nbsp; But that is
to be said of earl Harold&#146;s doings, that he came to Thurso and had six ships.&nbsp;
Earl Rognvald was then up the country in Sutherland, and sat there at a
wedding, at which he gave away his daughter Ingirid to Eric staybrails.&nbsp;
News came to him at once that earl Harold was come into Thurso.&nbsp; Earl
Rognvald rode down with a great company from the bridal to Thurso.&nbsp; Eric
staybrails was Harold&#146;s kinsman, and he did all he could to set them at one
again, and many others backed that with him, and said that it was as clear as
day to them that they ought not to let themselves be parted for the sake of that
kinship and those foster-ties and that fellowship which had been between
them.&nbsp; So it came about that a meeting was brought to pass between them
and peace given, and they were to meet in a castle at Thurso, and they two talk
alone, but each of them was to have as many men as the other hard by the
castle.&nbsp; They talked long, and things went well with them.&nbsp; They had
not met before since earl Rognvald came into the land.&nbsp; And when the day
was far spent, earl Rognvald was told that earl Harold&#146;s people were flocking
thither with arms.&nbsp; Earl Harold said that no harm would come of
that.&nbsp; Next after that they heard great blows struck outside, and then
they ran out.&nbsp; There was come Thorbjorn clerk with a great train of men,
and he began straightway to wound and maimearl Rognvald&#146;s men when they
met.&nbsp; The earls called out that they should not fight.&nbsp; Then men ran
up out of the town and parted them.&nbsp; There fell thirteen of earl
Rognvald&#146;s house-carles, but he himself was wounded in the face.&nbsp; After
that their friends did their best to set them at one again, and so it came
about that they were atoned and bound anew their friendship with oaths.&nbsp;
This was four nights before Michaelmas.&nbsp; Then too that counsel was taken
that they should fare at once that night out into the Orkneys against earl
Erlend and Sweyn.&nbsp; They held on with thirteen ships west on the Pentland
firth, and ran across to Rognvaldsey, (6) and made the land in Vidvoe, and
there went on shore.&nbsp; Earl Erlend and his men lay on shipboard in Bardswick,
and thence they saw a great company in Rognvaldsey, and sent out spies thither,
and then they had sure news that the earls had been set at one.&nbsp; It was
also told them that they would not let them have the power either of
strand-slaughter or any other stores of food, and must so mean then and there
to cut off their food in the isles.&nbsp; Then earl Erlend and his men went to
talk, and he sought counsel of his men.&nbsp; But they all agreed with one
voice that Sweyn should see to it what counsel should be taken.&nbsp; But Sweyn
gave utterance to this decision, that they should at once that very night sail
over to the Ness, and said that they had no strength to strive with both of
them there in the isles.&nbsp; He made that show before the people at large,
that they would fare to the Southern isles, and be there that winter.&nbsp;
That was Michaelmas eve when they sailed on the firth, but as soon as ever they
came to Caithness, they hastened up into the country, and drove down to the
shore great droves of cattle to slaughter and slaughtered them, and put them on
board their ships.&nbsp; Great storms were on and foul weather, and the firth
was always impassable.&nbsp; But as soon as ever there was a fair wind, Sweyn
sent men in a boat to the other side from the Ness to say that earl Erland had
slaughtered cattle on the shore in Caithness, and that they lay boun to sail to
the Southern isles as soon as ever they got a breeze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
when these tidings came to earl Rognvald's ears, he brought them before a
meeting of householders, and spoke to his people.&nbsp; He bade his men be wary
and keep good watch, and lie every night on board their ships, "for there
is not an hour of the day or night that I do not look for Sweyn here in the
Orkneys, and so much the rather that he made so many words about how he would
fare out of the land."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of winter
Sweyn and his companions fared out of Thurso, and turned west round the coast
of Scotland.&nbsp; They had seven ships, and all well manned and trimmed and
big.&nbsp; They began their passage by the help of oars alone.&nbsp; But when
they were come on their course away from the Ness, earl Rognvald's spies fared
out into the isles, and told him these tidings.&nbsp; The earls then rowed
their ships to Scapaneck, and earl Rognvald would that they should lie on board
their ships a while.&nbsp; Now when Sweyn and his companions had got about as
far west as Staur, Sweyn spoke and said that they would not plague themselves
any longer by rowing, and bade them put their ships about and hoist their
sails.&nbsp; This plan the men thought rather foolish, but still it was done as
Sweyn would.&nbsp; But when they had sailed about, the war-snakes ran swiftly
before the wind. (7)&nbsp; And nothing is told of their voyage before they come
to Vogland (8) in the Orkneys.&nbsp; There they heard that the earls lay at
Scapa-neck with fourteen ships off Knarstead.&nbsp; There was then Erlend the
young and Eric staybrails, and many other noble men.</p>

<p>103&nbsp; Thorbjorn clerk had gone east to Paplay at Firth to the house of
Hacon churl, his father-in-law.&nbsp; Thorbjorn then had his daughter Ingigerd
to wife.&nbsp; It was four nights before Simon's mass that Sweyn uttered that
decision, that he would row up and make an onslaught on the earls at
night.&nbsp; But that seemed rather foolhardy considering the difference of
force which there was.&nbsp; Still Sweyn would have his way, and so it was, for
the earl too was rather eager for it.</p>

<p>At even a storm of soft melting sleet set in;&nbsp; then earl Rognvald went
away from his ship and meant to go to Ofir to his house;&nbsp; he knew no cause
for fear;&nbsp; he was with six men.&nbsp; They came to Knarstead in the sleet
storm.&nbsp; There dwelt Botolf bungle, a man from Iceland and a good
skald.&nbsp; He asked earl Rognvald to be there with him the night over, and
tried to talk him over with many words.&nbsp; They went in, and their clothes
were pulled off them;&nbsp; they lay down to sleep, but Botolf was to keep
watch.&nbsp; That self same night earl Erlend and his men pulled up against
earl Harold and his men, and came upon them unawares, so that they knew nothing
of their coming before they heard the warcry.&nbsp; Then they ran to their
arms, and defended themselves like men.&nbsp; There was great slaughter, and
the onslaught ended so that earl Harold fled away up on shore, when only five
men were left upstanding on board the ship.&nbsp; There fell Bjarni Erlend the
young's brother, a man of rank and worth, and a hundred men with him, but a
whole crowd were wounded.&nbsp; All men ran from their ships and fled up on the
land.&nbsp; Few fell of earl Erlend's men, but the earl took there fourteen
ships that the earls owned, and all the goods that were on board them.&nbsp;
When the most of the work was done, they heard that earl Rognvald had gone away
from his ship that evening, and first up to Knarstead, and thither they
fared.&nbsp; Botolf the master was outside before the door when they came there,
and he gave them a hearty greeting.&nbsp; They asked whether earl Rognvald were
there by chance.&nbsp; Botolf said he had been there that night.&nbsp; But they
behaved wildly, and asked where he then was, and said he must know.&nbsp;
Botolf stretched out his hand up and round about the yard, and sang a song:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"After fowls the chieftain fares;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soldiers shoot their weapons well;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yonder heath-hen 'neath the hill</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
May have hope of blow on neck;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There the cross-bow crushes heath-poults</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wondrously when warriors meet,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Warrior stems that wound the snake; (9)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The king defends his land with sword."</p>

<p>The earl's men ran headlong out of the "town," (10) and he thought
he had the best of it who ran fastest and first got power over the earl.&nbsp;
But Botolf went indoors and woke up the earl, and tells him those tidings that
had happened in the night, and also what the earl's men were after.&nbsp; Then
they jumped up and clothed themselves, and fared away at once, and to Orfir to
the earl's house, and when they came there, earl Harold was there before them
in hiding.&nbsp; Then they fared at once over to the Ness each in his boat, the
one with three men and the other with four men.&nbsp; All their men fared over
to the Ness as they got passages.&nbsp; Earl Erlend and Sweyn took all the
earl's ships and very much goods.&nbsp; Sweyn Asleif's son made them hand over
to him as his share all earl Rognvald's treasures that were taken on board his
ship, and he sent them to earl Rognvald over to the Ness.&nbsp; Sweyn was very
eager that earl Erlend and his men should station their ships out in Vogaland,
and that they should lie in that part of the Firth (11) where they could see
any sailing of ships as soon as ever they put out from the Ness. &nbsp;He
thought it good thence to lie in wait for attacks, if there were any chance of
a passage.&nbsp; But earl Erlend made up his mind, for the sake of the egging
on of his levies, that they should fare north to Damsay, and there they drank
by day in a great hall, but lashed their ships together every evening, and
slept in them by night.&nbsp; And so it went up to the Yule fast.&nbsp; It was
five nights before Yule, that Sweyn Asleif son fared east to Sandwick to Sigrid
his kinswoman;&nbsp; he was to make up a quarrel between her and her neighbour,
whose name was Bjorn.&nbsp; But ere he fared away, he spoke to earl Erlend that
he should sleep on shipboard by night, and be then not less wary though he
[Sweyn] were not with him.&nbsp; Sweyn was one night at the house of his
kinswoman Sigrid.</p>

<p>104&nbsp; Gisl was the name of a man;&nbsp; he was Sweyn's tenant and dear
friend.&nbsp; He made a prayer to Sweyn that he should come as a guest to his
house, and see how matters stood with him.&nbsp; He had made them brew liquor,
and wated to tap it for Sweyn and his men.&nbsp; When they came at even to
Gil's (12) house, it was told them that earl Erlend had not gone to the ships
the evening before.&nbsp; As soon as ever Sweyn heard this, he sent Margad
Grim's son and two other men to the earl, and bade him take heed to his
counsel, though he had not done so the night before;&nbsp; "but,"
says he, "methinks it is to be dreaded that I shall need to take counsel
for this earl but a short while longer."&nbsp; Margad and his companions
fared to find earl Erlend, and told him Sweyn's words.&nbsp; The earl's men
said he [Sweyn] had wondrous ways;&nbsp; they said that one while he thought
nothing too dangerous, but sometimes he was so afraid that he scarce knew how
to keep himself or others safe.&nbsp; They said that they would sleep in peace
on land, and not fare to the ships.&nbsp; The earl said it should be so as
Sweyn had laid it down;&nbsp; and the end of it was, that the earl went on
board his own ship with four-and-twenty men, but all the others lay up at the
house.&nbsp; Margad and those who were on board Sweyn's ship lay in another bay
a short way off thence.</p>

<p>This very same night earl Rognvald and earl Harold came unawares upon earl
Erlend, so that those watchmen who watched on the isle and on the ship were
none of them aware of it before they boarded the ship.&nbsp; Orm was the name
of a man, and Ufi was another;&nbsp; they were in the forehold on board earl
Erlend's ship.&nbsp; Ufi jumped up, and would wake the earl, and could not get
him awakened, so dead drunk was he.&nbsp; Ufi caught up the earl in his arms,
and leapt overboard with him, and into the after boat which floated by the
ship's side;&nbsp; but Orm leapt over on the other side, and he got safe to
land.&nbsp; But the earl lost his life, and most of the other men who were in
the ships. (13)&nbsp; The men on board Sweyn's ship wakened at the war cry, and
cut the cable asunder, and pulled out off the ness, but the full moon gave a
strong light, and then they saw that the earls were pulling away.&nbsp; Then
they thought they could tell that they must have settled their business with
earl Erlend.&nbsp; Sweyn's house carles then rowed away, and fared first to
Rendale, but sent a man to Sweyn to tell him such things as they had then seen
and heard.&nbsp; Earl Harold was for giving peace to earl Erlend's men, but
earl Rognvald would wait first to see whether his body were found, or whether
he had got away.&nbsp; Earl Erlend's body was found two nights before
Yule;&nbsp; the shaft of a spear was seen standing up out of the seaweed, and
when they got to it, that spear stood right through him.&nbsp; His body was
borne to the church, but then peace was given to the earl's men, and so too to
four of Sweyn's house carles who were taken.&nbsp; John was the name of a man
who was called wing;&nbsp; he was a sister's son of John wing, of whom it was
spoken before, he had been with Hacon churl, and had got his sister with child,
and then ran away a sea roving with Anakol, but now he was with earl Erlend,
and yet he had not been at the battle.&nbsp; Earl Erlend's men made their way
to Kirkwall, and took shelter in Magnus' church.&nbsp; The earls also fared
thither, and then a meeting for a settlement was fixed in the church.&nbsp;
Then John could not get an atonement with the earls before he had given his
word to keep his wedding with the woman.&nbsp; There all men took oaths to the
earls, and they settled that matter rather easily.&nbsp; John wing bound
himself over into earl Harold's hand, and became his steward.</p>

<p>105&nbsp; When Sweyn Asleif's son heard of the fall of earl Erlend, he fared
to Rendale, and met his house carles there. (14)&nbsp; They were able to tell
him plainly of the tidings that had happened in Damsay.&nbsp; After that Sweyn
and his men fared to Rowsay, and came there at the flood-tide;&nbsp; they took
all the tackling out of the ship, and laid her up;&nbsp; they shared the men
about among the houses, and kept spies out between them and the earls and
others of the great men to know what each were doing.&nbsp; Sweyn Asleif's son
went there up on the fell, and five men with him, and so down the other side to
the sea shore, and stole right up to a homestead thereabouts in the
darkness.&nbsp; They heard a great chattering inside.&nbsp; There were that
father and son, Thorfinn and Ogmund, and Erlend their brother in law.&nbsp;
Erlend, he was boasting about that to that father and son, that he had given
earl Erlend his death blow, but they all thought they had fought very
well.&nbsp; And when Sweyn heard that, he springs inside into the house at
them, and his companions after him.&nbsp; Sweyn was quickest, and he smote
Erlend at once his death blow;&nbsp; but they took Thorfinn prisoner, and had
him off along with them, but Ogmund was slightly wounded.&nbsp; Sweyn and his
men fared to Thingwall;&nbsp; there dwelt then Helgi Sweyn's father's brother,
and they were there at the beginning of Yule in hiding.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald
fared to Damsay at Yule, but earl Harold stayed behind at Kirkwall.&nbsp; Earl
Rognvald sent men to Thingwall to Helgi, and bade him tell his kinsman Sweyn if
he knew anything as to where he was, that the earl wanted to bid him to stay
with him at Yule, and said he was willing to have a hand in setting him and
earl Harold at one again.&nbsp; And when these words came to Sweyn, he fared to
meet earl Rognvald with five men, and was with him the latter part of Yule.
(15)&nbsp; But after Yule a meeting to make friends was fixed between Sweyn and
the earls;&nbsp; there all those quarrels were to be put an end to which had
not been already made up.&nbsp; And when they met, earl Rognvald did his best
to make Sweyn and earl Harold friends, but most men there were very hard in
their counsel against him, who were not already either kinsfolk or friends of
Sweyn;&nbsp; but those men said that trouble would always arise from Sweyn if
he were not made away with out of the isles.&nbsp; But that settlement was
made, that Sweyn should pay a mark of gold to each of the earls, and lose half
his lands and his good longship.&nbsp; Sweyn answers when he hears the
award:&nbsp; "This atonement will be best kept if I am not treated with
dishonour."&nbsp; Earl Rognvald would not take the fine from Sweyn.&nbsp;
He says he will in no wise disgrace him, he says, too, he thinks there is much
more gain to be got from his friendship than from his goods.&nbsp; Earl Harold
fared after the atonement to Gairsay to Sweyn's house, and dealt there rather
wastefully with his corn and other gear that he had.&nbsp; But when Sweyn heard
that he brought it before earl Rognvald, and called it a breach of the
atonement, and said he would fare home and see after his stores.&nbsp; Earl
Rognvald said;&nbsp; "Be with me, Sweyn and I will send word to the earl,
and again bring him to speak about your affairs;&nbsp; but I will not that thou
shouldst think to strive against earl Harold, for he will be too much of a man
for thee in strife, though thou art a mighty man in thyself, and a bold brisk
man."&nbsp; But Sweyn would not let himself be hindered, and fared with
nine men in a cutter to Gairsay, and came there late at even. &nbsp;They saw
fire in the bake house; (16) Sweyn fared thither to it.&nbsp; He wished that
they should take the fire and lay it to the hall, and burn the homestead and
the earl inside it.&nbsp; Sweyn Blakari's son was the name of a man;&nbsp; he
was the man of most weight of all those that were there with Sweyn;&nbsp; he
set his face most against this, and said might be the earl were not in the
house.&nbsp; But even though he were there, he says that they would not let his
wife or his daughters come out;&nbsp; but says that it would never do to burn
them inside the house.&nbsp; Then Sweyn and his men went to the doorway, and so
in towards the hall door;&nbsp; then those men sprang up who were in the hall,
and shut to the door.&nbsp; Then Sweyn and his men became aware that the earl
was not in the homestead.&nbsp; But those who were inside gave up their
defence, and handed over their weapons to Sweyn and his men, and came out all
unarmed, and Sweyn gave peace to all the earl's house carles.&nbsp; Sweyn
broached all his drink, and had away with him his wife and daughters.&nbsp; He
asked Ingirid his wife where Harold was, but she would not tell him:&nbsp;
"Hold thy peace then and point it out to us."&nbsp; She would not do
that either.&nbsp; She was the earl's kinswoman.&nbsp; Sweyn gave up some of
their arms when they came on shipboard.&nbsp; There was an end of the atonement
between Sweyn and the earl when this news was heard.&nbsp; Earl Harold had gone
to a little isle to hunt hares.&nbsp; Sweyn held on his course to Hellis isle,
(17) that is a craggy isle towards the sea, and there is a great cave in the
rock, and the sea came right up into the mouth of the cave at flood-tide.&nbsp;
When earl Harold's house carles got their weapons from Sweyn and his men, they
fared straightway to find earl Harold, and told him of their dealings with
Sweyn.&nbsp; The earl made them launch his ship at once, and egged on his men
to row after them, "and let us now bring matters to the sword's
point."&nbsp; Then they fell to rowing after them, and each saw the other
and knew one another.&nbsp; And when Sweyn sees that the earl and his men were
drawing up to them, Sweyn spoke and said:&nbsp; "We must try and seek some
plan, for I have no mind to meet him when matters are so hot between us, with
the difference in force which there will be;&nbsp; we will take that
counsel," says he, "to fare to the cave, and see what turn our
matters then take."&nbsp; So Sweyn and his men did.&nbsp; They came to the
cave at the flood, laid the ship up there, for the cave sloped up into the
rock;&nbsp; then the sea rose and flowed into the mouth of the cave.&nbsp; Earl
Harold and his men fared all day about the isle looking for them and found them
not;&nbsp; they saw too no sailing of ships from the isle.&nbsp; They wondered
much at that;&nbsp; they thought it unlikely that Sweyn should have foundered
and sunk.&nbsp; They rowed round and round the isle to look for Sweyn and could
not find him, as was likly.&nbsp; Then the most they could make of it was that
Sweyn and his men must have borne up for other islands;&nbsp; then they rowed
thither to seek them where they thought likeliest.&nbsp; Almost as soon as ever
the earl and his men rowed away, the sea fell from the cave's mouth.&nbsp;
Sweyn and his men had heard the talk of the earl and his men.&nbsp; Sweyn left
his ship behind in the cave, (18) but they took an old ship of burden on the
isle, which the monks owned, and held on in her to Sanday.&nbsp; There they
went on land, but shoved off the ship of burden and she drove about from strand
to strand until she broke up.&nbsp; But Sweyn and his men went up into the
isle, and came to that homestead which is called Valaness, there that man dwelt
whose name was Bard, Sweyn's kinsman.&nbsp; They called him out by stealth, and
Sweyn said that he wished to stay there.&nbsp; Bard said he should do so if he
pleased "but I dare not that ye be here save in hiding."&nbsp; They
went in and were alone in [a room in] the house, so that only a wall of wattle
was between them and other men.&nbsp; There was a secret doorway in the house
in which Sweyn was, and stones were loosely piled up in it.&nbsp; That
afternoon came John wing earl Harold's steward and seven of them
together.&nbsp; Bard gave them a hearty welcome, and fires were made for them,
and they roasted themselves at them.&nbsp; John was very wild in his words, and
talked about the tidings that had happened in those dealings which the earls
had had with Sweyn;&nbsp; he blamed Sweyn much, and said he was a dastardly
trucebreaker and true to no man;&nbsp; he had but just now made peace with earl
Harold, and yet he would fare forthwith and burn the house over his head:&nbsp;
he said too there would never be peace in the land before Sweyn were driven out
of the land.&nbsp; The master Bard and John's companions rather spoke up for
Sweyn.&nbsp; After that John took to speaking ill of earl Erlend, and said that
was no scathe though he had lost his life;&nbsp; he called him such an overbearing
man, that no one dared to call his head his own for him.&nbsp; And when Sweyn
heard that, then he could not stand it, and snatched up his weapons and ran at
the secret doorway, and hurled down the stones out of it.&nbsp; Then there was
a great clatter.&nbsp; Sweyn meant to run round to the hall door.&nbsp; John
sat in his shirt and linen breeks.&nbsp; And when he heard the noise that Sweyn
made he lost no time in lacing up his shoon, but jumped up from the fire, and
set off at once away from the house.&nbsp; But it was moonless and pitch dark,
and a sharp frost.&nbsp; He came that night to another homestead, and was much
frostbitten on his feet, so that some of his toes dropped off.&nbsp; Sweyn gave
peace to John's companions for master Bard's words' sake.&nbsp; Sweyn was there
that night, but afterwards next morning they fared away thence with a cutter
which Bard owned and gave to Sweyn.&nbsp; Then they fared south to Bardswick,
and were there at a cave.&nbsp; Sweyn was sometimes during the day at the house
and drank there, but slept by his ship at night, and so guarded himself against
his foes.</p>

<p>106&nbsp; It happened one morning early that Sweyn and his men saw a great
longship fare from Hrossey to Rognvaldsey, and Sweyn knew at once that it was
earl Rognvald's ship, that he was wont to steer himself, and they ran into
Rognvaldsey, and thither where Sweyn's cutter lay, and five men went on shore
from the earl's ship, but Sweyn and his men were on a height, and pelted the
earl's men with stones thence.&nbsp; And when they saw that from the ship, men
got out their arms.&nbsp; But when Sweyn and his men saw that they ran down
from the height and to the beach, and shoved off the cutter and jumped into
her.&nbsp; The longship had run up on shore, so that she was fast.&nbsp; Sweyn
stood up in his cutter as they rowed out by the longship, and had a spear in his
hand.&nbsp; But when earl Rognvald saw that, then he took a shield and held it
before him, but Sweyn did not throw the spear.&nbsp; But when the earl saw that
they were about to part, he made them hold up a truce shield, (19) and begged
that Sweyn and his men would come to land.&nbsp; But when Sweyn saw that, he
bade his men pull to land, and says he would still be best pleased if he could
be made friends with earl Rognvald.</p>

<p>107&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that earl Rognvald and Sweyn went on
shore, and they two talked long together, and things went smoothly with
them.&nbsp; And as they sat a talking then they saw earl Harold's sailing, as
he fared from Caithness and to Vogaland. (20)&nbsp; And when the ship bore away
under the island, then Sweyn asked the earl what counsel should be taken
now.&nbsp; The earl says that Sweyn should fare over to the Ness then and
there.&nbsp; This was in Lent.&nbsp; They fared both at the same time out of
Rognvaldsey, the earl he fared to Hrossey, but Sweyn fared west to Stroms, and
earl Harold and his men saw the ship, and thought they knew that Sweyn owned
her.&nbsp; They put out at once into the firth after them.&nbsp; And when Sweyn
and his men saw that the earl and his men held on after them;&nbsp; then they
left their ship and hid themselves away.&nbsp; But when earl Harold came to
Stroms, they saw Sweyn's ship, and doubted then that the abodes of men must be
too near, and for that they would not land from their ship.&nbsp; Amundi was a
man's name the son of Hnefi;&nbsp; he was a friend of earl Harold, but a
father's brother of Sweyn Asleif's son's step-children;&nbsp; he came between
them then, and got it brought about that the same atonement should be held
which had been made the winter before.&nbsp; Then a storm of wind sprung
up;&nbsp; and each side had to stay there that night;&nbsp; and Amundi stowed
away earl Harold and Sweyn both in one bed.&nbsp; In that house many men of
each of them took their rest.&nbsp; After this atonement Sweyn fared over to
the Ness, but earl Harold over to the Orkneys.&nbsp; Sweyn heard that the earl
had said that he called their peace making rather loosely made.&nbsp; Little
heed paid Sweyn to that.&nbsp; He fared south into the Dales, and was that
Easter with Summerled his friend;&nbsp; but earl Harold fared north to
Shetland, and was there very long that spring.&nbsp; Sweyn fared from the south
after Easter, and met on the way John wing's two brothers, the name of the one
was Peter down-at-heel, (21) but the other's Blane.&nbsp; Sweyn and his men
took them captive and stripped them of all their goods, but brought them to
land;&nbsp; then a gallows tree was hewn for them.&nbsp; And when all was
ready, Sweyn said that they should run away up the country;&nbsp; he said it
would be more shame to their brother John that they should live.&nbsp; They
were long out in the cold and much frozen when they got to a homestead.&nbsp;
Sweyn fared thence to the Southern isles to the Lewes, and stayed there a
while.&nbsp; But when John wing heard that Sweyn had taken his brothers
captive, but knew not what he had done with them, then he fared to Enhallow,
(22) and there seized Olaf Sweyn's son, Kolbein the burly's fosterchild, and
fared with him to Westray.&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald and he met at Rapness, and
when the earl saw Olaf there, he said:&nbsp; "Why art thou here,
Olaf?"&nbsp; He answers:&nbsp; "It is John wing's doing."&nbsp;
The earl looked to John, and said:&nbsp; "Why broughtest thou Olaf
hither?"&nbsp; He answered:&nbsp; "Sweyn seized my brothers, and I
know not that he has not slain them."&nbsp; The earl said:&nbsp;
"Carry thou him back as fast as thou canst, and do not dare to do him any
harm, whatever has become of thy bretheren;&nbsp; for thou wilt have no peace
in the isles, either at Sweyn's or Kolbein's hands, if thou doest aught to
him."</p>

<p>108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Easter in the spring Sweyn began his
voyage from the Southern isles, and had sixty men.&nbsp; He held on his course
to the Orkneys, and first to Rowsay.&nbsp; There he seized that man whose name
was Hacon churl;&nbsp; he had been with earl Harold when earl Erlend
fell.&nbsp; Hacon bought himself off with three marks of gold, and so freed
himself from Sweyn.&nbsp; There in Rowsay Sweyn and his men found that ship
which the earls had awarded that Sweyn should give up, and the bulwarks on both
sides had been hewn out of her.&nbsp; That earl Rognvald had made them do, for
no one had been willing either to buy or beg the ship from the earls.&nbsp;
Sweyn held on then to Hrossey, and found earl Rognvald in Birsay.&nbsp; The
earl gave him a hearty welcome, and Sweyn was with him that spring.&nbsp; Earl
Rognvald says that was why he had hewn the bulwarks out of the ship, because he
did not wish him to do any hasty deed there in the isles when he came back from
the Southern isles.&nbsp; Sweyn was there with earl Rognvald and fourteen men
besides himself.&nbsp; Earl Harold came from Shetland that spring at
Whitsuntide, and as soon as ever he came into the Orkneys, earl Rognvald sent
men to him to say that his will was that he and Sweyn should make friends
anew.&nbsp; And then the meeting for an atonement was fixed for the Friday in
the Holy Week in Magnus' church, and earl Rognvald went with a broad axe to the
meeting and Sweyn with him.&nbsp; Then the self same atonement was agreed upon
which had been brought about the winter before.</p>

<p>109&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then earl Rognvald gave to earl Harold that ship
which Sweyn had owned, but he gave to Sweyn all else that had been awarded from
him and came to his share.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald and Sweyn stood by the church
door while the sail was being borne out;&nbsp; for it had been laid up in
Magnus' church;&nbsp; and Sweyn looked rather cross when they bore out the
sail.&nbsp; The Saturday after, when nones were over, earl Harold's men came to
see Sweyn Asleif's son, and said that he would that Sweyn should come and talk
with him.&nbsp; Sweyn brought that message before earl Rognvald, and he was not
very eager that Sweyn should go on this quest;&nbsp; he says he does not know
whether he might trust them.&nbsp; But Sweyn went nevertheless, and six of them
together.&nbsp; The earl sat in a little room on a cross bench, and Thorbjorn
clerk by him.&nbsp; There were few other men with the earl.&nbsp; They greeted
the earl worthily;&nbsp; and he took their greeting well.&nbsp; They made room
for Sweyn to sit;&nbsp; so they sat a while and drank.&nbsp; After that
Thorbjorn went away, and Sweyn and his men said that they then doubted much as
to what the earl was about to take in hand.&nbsp; Thorbjorn came back a little
after and gave Sweyn a scarlet kirtle and cloak and sword;&nbsp; he said he did
not know whether he would call them a gift, for those precious things had been
taken from Sweyn the winter before.&nbsp; Sweyn accepted these gifts.&nbsp;
Earl Harold gave Sweyn the longship which he had owned, and half his lands and
estates.&nbsp; He asked Sweyn to come and be with him, and said their
friendship should never fail.&nbsp; Sweyn took this well, and went at once that
night, and told earl Rognvald how things had gone with earl Harold and
himself.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald showed that he was glad at that, and bade Sweyn
take heed that they did not fall out again.</p>

<p>110&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime after these three chiefs made up their
minds to go a sea roving, Sweyn, Thorbjorn, and Eric.&nbsp; They fared first to
the Southern isles.&nbsp; They fared as far west as the Scilly isles, and won
there a great victory in Mary Haven (23) on Columba's mass, and got very much
war spoil.&nbsp; After that they fared to the Orkneys, and were well agreed.</p>

<p>After the atonement of earl Rognvald and earl Harold and Sweyn Asleif's son,
the earls were always both together, and earl Rognvald had the leadership, but
they were very good friends.&nbsp; When they came home from Scilly, Thorbjorn
clerk fared to earl Harold, and became his chief councillor.&nbsp; Sweyn fared
home to Gairsay, and sat there with a great band of men in the winters, and had
his war spoil to keep up his household expenses, along with his other stores,
which he had there in the isles.&nbsp; He had most leaning to earl
Rognvald.&nbsp; Every summer he was out roving.&nbsp; It was said that
Thorbjorn clerk made things no better between earl Rognvald and earl
Harold.&nbsp; Thorarin cod-nose was the name of one of earl Rognvald's body
guard and his friend too;&nbsp; he was always with the earl.&nbsp; Thorkell was
the name of one of Thorbjorn clerk's followers and friends.&nbsp; Those
Thorarin and Thorkell, quarrelled over their drink in Kirkwall, and Thorkell
gave Thorarin a wound, and got away afterwards to Thorbjorn.&nbsp; Thorarin's
messmates followed Thorkell up, but he and Thorbjorn defended themselves out of
a loft.&nbsp; Then that was told to the earls, and they came to the spot to
part them.&nbsp; Thorbjorn would not let earl Rognvald utter an award in this
quarrel, and found fault with the hue and cry that had been made to his
house.&nbsp; But when Thorarin was whole of his wounds, then he slew Thorkell
as he went to church.&nbsp; Thorarin ran into the church, but Thorbjorn and his
men ran after him and his followers.&nbsp; Then that was told to earl Rognvald,
and he went thither with a great company, and asked whether Thorbjorn meant to
break open the church.&nbsp; Thorbjorn said that the church had no right to
hold those who were inside it.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald said once for all the church
must not be broken into, and Thorbjorn was hustled away from the church by the
throng of men.&nbsp; No atonement was made for this.&nbsp; Thorbjorn fared over
to the Ness, and was there a while.&nbsp; Then there was much heard of their
doings, for Thorbjorn did much mischief both in the ravishing of women and in
slaughter of men.&nbsp; Thorbjorn fared by stealth into the Orkneys, in a
cutter, with thirty men with him.&nbsp; He rushed in by himself alone in the
evening into the tavern where Thorarin was a drinking.&nbsp; Thorbjorn smote
him at once his death blow;&nbsp; after that he ran off in the dark far
away.&nbsp; For this sake earl Rognvald made Thorbjorn clerk an outlaw over all
his realm.&nbsp; Thorbjorn fared over to the Ness, and was with his brother in
law Hosvir in hiding;&nbsp; he was called "the strong";&nbsp; he had
to wife Ragnhilda, Thorbjorn's sister;&nbsp; their son was Stephen councillor,
Thorbjorn's follower.&nbsp; A little while after Thorbjorn fared to see Malcolm
the Scot-king, and was with him in good cheer.&nbsp; With the Scot-king was the
man whose name was Gilli-Odran;&nbsp; he was of great kindred and a very unfair
man;&nbsp; he fell under the wrath of the Scot-king for the mischief and
manslaying which he wrought in his realm.&nbsp; Gilli-Odran ran away into the
Orkneys, and the earls took him into their service.&nbsp; Gilli-Odran was in
Caithness, and had the earl's stewardship there.&nbsp; Helgi was the name of a
man of rank and a householder in Caithness, he was earl Rognvald's friend.&nbsp;
He and Gilli-Odran quarrelled about the stewardship, and Gilli-Odran fell upon
him and slew him.&nbsp; But after the manslaughter he fared away west to
Scotland's firths, and that chief took him in whose name was Summerled the
freeman, he had rule in the Dales, in Scotland's firths.&nbsp; Summerled had to
wife Ragnhilda daughter of Olaf bitling, (24) the Southern isle king.&nbsp; The
mother of Ragnhilda was Ingibjorg, the daughter of earl Hacon Paul's son.&nbsp;
These were the children of Summerled and Ragnhilda:&nbsp; Dougal the king,
Rognvald, and Angus, that is called the Dale-dwellers' kin.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald
summoned to him Sweyn Asleif's son ere he went on his roving cruise.&nbsp; And
when they met, earl Rognvald begged him to keep a look out for Gilli-Odran if
he had a chance.&nbsp; Sweyn said he could not tell what might be fated to come
of it.</p>

<p>111.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that Sweyn
fared off on his viking cruise, and had five longships.&nbsp; And when he came
west off Scotland's firths, Sweyn heard that Summerled the freeman was gone on
board ship, and meant to go a roving;&nbsp; he had seven ships.&nbsp; There
Gilli-Odran steered one ship, and he was gone higher up the firths after that
force which had not yet come.&nbsp; As soon as ever Sweyn heard of Summerled,
he ran in to battle against him, and there was a hard battle.&nbsp; And in that
fight fell Summerled the freeman, and much folk with him.&nbsp; There Sweyn
became sure that Gilli-Odran had not been there.&nbsp; Then Sweyn fared to look
him up, and found him in Murkfirth, and there he slew Gilli-Odran and fifty men
with him.&nbsp; After that Sweyn fared a sea roving, and back at autumn, as he
was wont.&nbsp; And when he came home he was not long in meeting earl Rognvald,
and he showed himself well pleased at those deeds.</p>

<p>112.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the earl's
custom nearly every summer to fare over to Caithness, and there to go up into
the woods and wastes to hunt red deer or reindeer. (1)&nbsp; Thorbjorn clerk
was with Malcolm the Scot-king, but sometimes he fared down to the Ness, and
was with his friends by stealth.&nbsp; He had three friends in Caithness, in
whom he placed most trust.&nbsp; One was Hosvir his brother in law;&nbsp; the
second Lifolf, who dwelt in Thorsdale;&nbsp; the third was Halvard Dufa's son,
who dwelt at Force in Calfdale which goes off from Thorsdale.&nbsp; These were
his bosom friends.</p>

<p>113.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When earl
Rognvald had been earl two and twenty winters since earl Paul was made captive,
then the earls fared over to Caithness, when the summer was far spent, after
their wont.&nbsp; And when they came to Thurso, then they heard some rumour
that Thorbjorn clerk must be up Thorsdale in hiding, and not at all
short-handed, and how he must mean an onslaught thence if he got a
chance.&nbsp; Then the earls got men together to them, and fared with a band of
one hundred, and twenty of them ride, but the others were on foot.&nbsp; They
fared in the evening up the dale and turned in as guests somewhere where there
was (what the Celts call) "erg," but we call "setr" (a
shieling on the hill).&nbsp; That evening, as men sat by the fires, earl
Rognvald sneezed very often.&nbsp; Earl Harold spoke and said:&nbsp;
"Shrill sneezing kinsman."&nbsp; They fared on up the dale the next
morning, and earl Rognvald rode always on in front that day, and that man with
him whose name was Asolf;&nbsp; another man who was with him was Jomar his
kinsman.&nbsp; Five of them together so ride a head up along Calfdale.
(2)&nbsp; And as they fared to the homestead which is called Force, master
Halvard was up on a corn-rick, and piled it up, but his house carles bore the
sheaves up to him.&nbsp; Earl Harold and his men rode somewhat behind.&nbsp;
But when Halvardk knew earl Rognvald, he hailed him by name, and bawled out
very loud, and asked him after news, and his voice might have been heard just
as well though he were farther off.&nbsp; This was a little way from the
sitting room, and the house stood on a high brink;&nbsp; but there was a narrow
fenced path to ride along up to the house, and it was very steep.&nbsp; In this
homestead was Thorbjorn clerk inside, and sat at drink.&nbsp; The fenced path
led up to the house end at the gable, and there was a doorway in the house and
another doorway in the gable, and stones heaped up loosely in it.&nbsp; When
Thorbjorn and his men heard the words that passed, and how Halvard hailed earl
Rognvald and his men, they ran at once to their arms, and broke down the stones
out of the secret door, and sprang out at it.&nbsp; Thorbjorn runs round the
gable, and to the fence of the path.&nbsp; Just then the earl and his men had
come to the door.&nbsp; Then Thorbjorn smote at once at the earl, but Asolf
threw his arms in the way, and the stroke toomk off his hand.&nbsp; Afterwards
the sword came on the earl's chin, and that was a great wound.&nbsp; Asolf
said, when he got the stroke:&nbsp; "Let those follow the earl better who
have more gifts to pay him for."&nbsp; He was then eighteen winters old,
and was newcome to the earl.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald wanted to jump off his horse's
back when he saw Thorbjorn, but his foot got fast in the stirrup.&nbsp; At that
moment up came Stephen and thrust at the earl with a spear.&nbsp; Then
Thorbjorn gave the earl another wound.&nbsp; But Jomar just then thrust a spear
into Thorbjorn's thigh, and the blow passed on into his small entrails.&nbsp;
Then Thorbjorn and his men turned to the back of the house, and there they had
to run down a great steep brink, and on to a soft moor.&nbsp; Just then up came
earl Harold and his men, and their course was so shaped that they came right in
the way of Thorbjorn and his men, and then each knew the others.&nbsp; Then the
earl's men said, those who knew what was in the wind, that they should turn
after Thorbjorn and his men;&nbsp; but earl Harold set his face against it, and
says he will wait and hear what earl Rognvald says about this matter:&nbsp; "For
Thorbjorn is a very great friend of mine as ye know, for kinship's sake, and
many other ties which are between us."&nbsp; But those men who were with
earl Rognvald thronged about him dead, (3) and rather a long time passed ere
earl Harold and his men heard the tidings.&nbsp; Then they [Thorbjorn and his
men] were come on to the moor, and across the quagmire which ran along through
the moor.&nbsp; But for the egging on of the earls' companions, earl Harold and
his men ran down on the moor, and the two bands met at the quagmire, so that
each band was on its own side, and Thorbjorn and his men held the bank of the
dike against them.&nbsp; Then those men flocked to him from the homestead who
had followed him thither, and all together they made up fifty men.&nbsp; Then they
defended themselves manfully, and had a good stronghold to fight from, for the
quagmire was both broad and deep, and the moor was soft up to it in front, and
the only way they could make an onslaught on them was, that they shot at them
with spears.&nbsp; Thorbjorn told his men that they should not shoot any of
them back.&nbsp; And when the shots died away, then they began to speak to one
another, and Thorbjorn called out to earl Harold and spoke thus:&nbsp;
"This I will pray of you, kinsman, that ye give me peace;&nbsp; but I will
offer to give over this matter into your power, that ye alone may doom
it;&nbsp; and I will then shrink from no one thing that is in my power, that
your honour may be then more than it was before.&nbsp; I hope also, kinsman,
that thou wilt bear in mind that those strifes have been, in which thou wouldst
not have made such a difference between us two, earl Rognvald and me, that thou
wouldst have slain me though I had done this deed, I mean when he kept thee
most under his elbow, and let thee have no voice in anything any more than his
knave;&nbsp; but I gave thee the best gifts, and looked to do thee honour in
all that I could.&nbsp; But this deed that I have done in great wickedness, and
that lies on me, but the whole realm is fallen into your power.&nbsp; You may
also know this, that earl Rognvald meant the same lot for me which I have now
given to him;&nbsp; and it is my foreboding, kinsman, though things had turned
out so that I were dead, but earl Rognvald were alive, that you would treat him
as a man who had done a deed which you must put up with, but me ye now wish to
make a dead man."&nbsp; Thorbjorn went on so that many and fair spoken
words, and many men backed that with him, and begged for peace for him.&nbsp;
So it came that the earl began to listen to what he said when many backed
it.&nbsp; Then Magnus the son of Havard Gunni's son, a chieftain of the earls'
and their kinsman.&nbsp; He was the man of most birth and worth in the band
with earl Harold.&nbsp; He spoke thus:&nbsp; "It is no business of ours to
teach you what to do, earl, after these great deeds which we see before
us.&nbsp; But I must say how the common fame will run about them, if peace be
given to Thorbjorn after this work;&nbsp; and this besides I will say, that
when he dares to say to your face nearly at every word that he hath done this
his ill deed for thee, or wrought it for thy honour, it will be an everlasting
shame and dishonour to thee, and to all the earl's kinsfolk, if he be not
avenged.&nbsp; I think that earl Rognvald's friends will hold it for sooth that
thou must for a long while have been plotting the earl's death;&nbsp; but now
hast brought it about.&nbsp; Or thinkest thou that he will clear thy conscience
when he has to throw off the blame from himself, but when no one makes an
answer for you, when he now tells you to your face that he has wrought this misdeed
for your sake;&nbsp; or how couldest thou better prove the truth of that but by
now giving him peace.&nbsp; As for me, my mind is made up, that he shall never
have peace from me, if any good men and true will follow me, whether it believe
or loath to you."&nbsp; Just in the same way spoke his brothers, Thorstein
and Hacon, and Sweyn Hroald's son.&nbsp; Then they turned away from the earl,
and went up along the bank of the dike, and tried where they might get
across.&nbsp; And when Thorbjorn and his men saw that Magnus and his followers
turn away along the dike, then Thorbjorn began to speak and said:&nbsp;
"Now they must have split about the counsel to take, the earl will wish to
give me peace, but Magnus will speak against it."&nbsp; But while they
were speaking about that, Thorbjorn and his men fell away from the dike.&nbsp;
Earl Harold and his men stood on the dike bank.&nbsp; And when he saw that
nothing would come of the peace giving, he leapt over the quagmire with all his
weapons, and it was nine ells across the dike.&nbsp; His companions leapt after
him, and no one got to leap clear over, but most of them got hold of the bank
and so floundered to land.&nbsp; Thorbjorn's men egged him on that they should
turn either against the earl and his men or against Magnus and his men, and let
their quarrel be settled, there and then.&nbsp; Then Thorbjorn said:&nbsp;
"Methinks the best plan is that each man should choose what he thinks
likeliest to stand him in stead, but as for me, I will still look to meeting
with earl Harold."&nbsp; Most men set their faces against this, and begged
him rather to take to the woods and save himself.&nbsp; Thorbjorn would not
take that counsel.&nbsp; So those men his companions dropped off from him, and
looked for help for themselves in divers ways.&nbsp; But Thorbjorn and eight
men together with him were left behind.&nbsp; And when he sees that earl Harold
is come over the dike, he goes to meet him, and fell on his knees before him,
and says he brings him his head.&nbsp; Many of the earl's men still begged for
peace for Thorbjorn.&nbsp; Then the earl began to speak, and said:&nbsp;
"Away and save thyself, Thorbjorn, I have no heart to slay thee, but I
will not see thee henceforth."&nbsp; Then they were faring down along
Calfdale's river, when these words passed between them.&nbsp; Magnus and his
men pressed on hard after them, and when the earl saw that, he spoke:&nbsp;
"Save thyself, Thorbjorn;&nbsp; I cannot fight for thee against my
men."&nbsp; Then Thorbjorn and his men parted from the earl's company, and
went to some empty shielings, which are called Asgrim's "erg";&nbsp;
Magnus and his men followed Thorbjorn and his men up, and forthwith set fire to
the house.&nbsp; Thorbjorn and his men defended themselves manfully.&nbsp; And
when the house began to fall down over their heads from the fire, Thorbjorn and
his men came out, and every weapon was at once brought to bear upon them that
could reach them;&nbsp; they were already much worn out by the force of the
flames.&nbsp; There all those nine brothers in arms lost their lives.&nbsp; And
when they came to look what wounds Thorbjorn had, his entrails had slipt out
into that wound which Jomar had given him.&nbsp; Earl Harold went his way down
along the dale, but Magnus and his men turned back to Force, and laid out earl
Rognvald's body and brought it down to Thurso.</p>

<p>Earl (4) Harold and his men fared with the body away thence out into the
Orkneys with a goodly company, and bestowed burial on it in St. Magnus' church
in the choir;&nbsp; and there he rested until Bishop Bjarni caused his halidom
(relics) to be taken up by the Pope's leave. (5)&nbsp; There on the stone on
which earl Rognvald's blood had come when he died, it may still be seen at this
very day as fair as though it were new shed blood.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald's death
was a great grief, for he was very much beloved there in the isles, and far and
wide elsewhere.&nbsp; He had been a very great helper to many men, bountiful of
money, gentle, and a steadfast friend;&nbsp; a great man for feats of strength
and a good skald.&nbsp; He had a daughter his only child alive, Ingigerd, whom
Eric staybrails had to wife.&nbsp; Their children were these:&nbsp; Harald the young,
and Magnus mannikin, Rognvald, and Ingibjorg, Elin, and Ragnhilda.</p>

<p>114.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fall of
earl Rognvald, earl Harold took all the isles under his rule, and became the
sole chief over them.&nbsp; Earl Harold was a mighty chief, one of the tallest
and strongest of men, "dour" and hard-hearted;&nbsp; he had to wife
Afreka; (6) their children were these:&nbsp; Henry and Hacon, Helena and
Margaret.&nbsp; When Hacon was but a few winters old, Sweyn Asleif's son
offered to take him as his foster child, and he was bred up there, and as soon
as ever he was so far fit, that he could go about with other men, then Sweyn
had him away with him a sea roving every summer, and led him on to the
worthiness in everything.&nbsp; It was Sweyn's wont at that time, that he sat
through the winter at home in Gairsay, and there he kept always about him
eighty men at his beck.&nbsp; He had so great a drinking hall, that there was
not another as great in all the Orkneys.&nbsp; Sweyn had in the spring hard
work, and made them lay down very much seed, and looked much after it himself.&nbsp;
But when that toil was ended, he fared away every spring on a viking voyage,
and harried about among the Southern isles and Ireland, and came home after
midsummer.&nbsp; That he called spring-viking.&nbsp; Then he was at home until
the corn fields were reaped down, and the grain seen to and stored.&nbsp; Then
he fared away on a viking voyage, and then he did not come home till the winter
was one month spent and that he called his autumn viking.</p>

<p>115.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These tidings
happened once on a time, that Sweyn Asleif's son fared away on his spring
cruise, then Hacon earl Harold's son fared with him;&nbsp; and they had five
ships with oars, and all of them large.&nbsp; They harried about among the
Southern isles.&nbsp; Then the folk was so scared at him in the Southern isles,
that men hid all their goods and chattels in the earth or in piles of
rocks.&nbsp; Sweyn sailed as far south as Man, and got ill off for spoil.&nbsp;
Thence they sailed out under Ireland and harried there.But when they came about
south under Dublin, then two keels sailed there from off the main, which had
come from England, and meant to steer for Dublin;&nbsp; they were laden with
English cloths, and great store of goods was aboard them.&nbsp; Sweyn and his
men pulled up to the keels, and offered them battle.&nbsp; Little came of the
defence of the Englishmen before Sweyn gave the word to board.&nbsp; Then the
Englishmen were made prisoners.&nbsp; And there they robbed them of every penny
which was aboard the keels, save that the Englishmen kept the clothes they
stood in and some food, and went on their way afterwards with the keels, but
Sweyn and his men fared to the Southern isles, and shared their war
spoil.&nbsp; They sailed from the west with great pomp.&nbsp; They did this as
a glory for themselves when they lay in harbours, that they threw awnings of English
cloth over their ships.&nbsp; But when they sailed into the Orkneys, they sewed
the cloth on the fore part of the sails, so that it looked in that wise as
though the sails were made altogether of broadcloth.&nbsp; This they called the
broadcloth cruise.&nbsp; Sweyn fared home to his house in Gairsay.&nbsp; He had
taken from the keels much wine and English mead.&nbsp; Now when Sweyn had been
at home a short while, he bade to him earl Harold, and made a worthy feast
against his coming.&nbsp; When earl Harold was at the feast, there was much
talk amongst them of Sweyn's good cheer.&nbsp; The earl spoke and said:&nbsp;
"This I would now, Sweyn, that thou wouldest lay aside thy sea
rovings;&nbsp; 'tis good now to drive home with a whole wain.&nbsp; But thou
knowest this, that thou hast long maintained thyself and thy men by sea roving,
but so it fares with most men who live by unfair means, that they lose their
lives in strife, if they do not break themselves from it."&nbsp; Then
Sweyn answered, and looked to the earl, and spoke with a smile, and said
thus:&nbsp; "Well spoken is this, lord, and friendly spoken, and it will
be good to take a bit of good counsel from you;&nbsp; but some men lay that to
your door, that ye too are men of little fairness."&nbsp; The earl
answered:&nbsp; "I shall have to answer for my share, but a gossiping
tongue drives me to say what I do."&nbsp; Sweyn said:&nbsp; "Good, no
doubt, drives you to it, lord.&nbsp; And so it shall be, that I will leave off
sea roving, for I find that I am growing old, and strength lessens much in
hardships and warfare.&nbsp; Now I will go out on my autumn cruise, and I would
that it might be with no less glory than the spring cruise was;&nbsp; but after
that my warfaring shall be over."&nbsp; The earl answers:&nbsp; "'Tis
hard to see, messmate, whether death or lasting luck will come first."&nbsp;
After that they dropped talking about it.&nbsp; Earl Harold fared away from the
feast, and was led out with fitting gifts.&nbsp; So he and Sweyn parted with
great love-tokens.</p>

<p>116.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little after
Sweyn busks him for his roving cruise;&nbsp; he had seven longships and all
great.&nbsp; Hacon earl Harold's son went along with Sweyn on his voyage.&nbsp;
They held on their course first to the Southern isles, and got there little war
spoil;&nbsp; thence they fared out under Ireland, and harried there far and
wide.&nbsp; They fared so far south as Dublin, and came upon them there very
suddenly, so that the townsmen were not ware of them before they had got into
the town.&nbsp; They took there much goods.&nbsp; They made prisoners there
those men who were rulers in the town.&nbsp; The upshot of their business was
that they gave the town up into Sweyn's power, and agreed to pay as great a
ransom as he chose to lay upon them.&nbsp; Sweyn was also to hold the town with
his men and to have rule over it.&nbsp; The Dublin men swear an oath to do
this.&nbsp; They fared to their ships at even, but next morning Sweyn was to
come into the town, and take the ransom, place his men about the town, and take
hostages from the townsmen.&nbsp; Now it must be told of what happened in the
town during the night.&nbsp; The men of good counsel who were in the town held
a meeting among themselves, and talked over the straits which had befallen
them;&nbsp; it seemed to them hard to let their town come into the power of the
Orkneyingers, and worst of all of that man whom they knew to be the most unjust
man in the Western lands.&nbsp; So they agreed amongst themselves that they
would cheat Sweyn if they might.&nbsp; They took that counsel, that they dug
great trenches before the burg gate on the inside, and in many other places
between the houses where it was meant that Sweyn and his men should pass;&nbsp;
but men lay in wait there in the houses hard by with weapons.&nbsp; They laid
planks over the trenches, so that they should fall down as soon as ever a man's
weight comes on them.&nbsp; After that they strewed straw on the planks so that
the trenches might not be seen, and so bided the morrow.</p>

<p>117.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning
after Sweyn and his men arose and put on their arms;&nbsp; after that they went
to the town.&nbsp; And when they came inside beyond the burg gate the Dublin
men made a lane from the burg gate right to the trenches.&nbsp; Sweyn and his
men saw not what they were doing, and ran into the trenches.&nbsp; The townsmen
they ran straightway to hold the burg gate, but some to the trenches, and
brought their arms to bear on Sweyn and his men.&nbsp; It was unhandy for them
to make any defence, and Sweyn lost his life there in the trenches, and all
those who had gone into the town.&nbsp; So it was said that Sweyn was the last
to die of all his messmates, and spoke these words ere he died:&nbsp;
"Know this all men, whether I lose my life today or not, that I am one of
the saint earl Rognvald's bodyguard, and I now mean to put my trust in being
there where he is with God." (7)&nbsp; Sweyn's men fared at once to their
ships and pulled away, and nothing is told about their voyage before they come
into the Orkneys.&nbsp; There now is an end of telling about Sweyn;&nbsp; and
it is the talk of men that he hath been most of a man for his own sake in the
Western lands, both of yore and now a days, of those men who had no higher
titles of honour than he. (8)</p>

<p>After the fall of Sweyn, his sons Olaf and Andrew shared his inheritance
between them.&nbsp; They made the next summer after Sweyn lost his life a
party-wall in that great drinking hall which he had owned in Gairsay.&nbsp;
Andrew Sweyn's son had to wife Frida Kolbein the burly's daughter, sister of
Bjarni, bishop of the Orkneyingers.</p>

<p>Earl Harold now ruled over the Orkneys, and was the greatest chief;&nbsp; he
had to wife afterwards Hvarflada (9) earl Malcolm's daughter of Moray.&nbsp;
Their children were these:&nbsp; Thorfinn, David, and John, Gunhilda, Herborga,
and Longlife.</p>
