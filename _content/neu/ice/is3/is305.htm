<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When bishop William the latter was dead,
Bjarni son of Kolbein the burly was consecrated to be bishop after him, and he
was one of the greatest chiefs and a dear friend of earl Harold.&nbsp; Bishop
Bjarni had a great stock of kinsmen in the isles.&nbsp; The sons of Eric
staybrails were these:&nbsp; Harold the young, and Magnus mannikin, and
Rognvald.&nbsp; Those brothers fared east to Norway to find king Magnus
Erling's son, and he gave Harold the title of earl and half the isles, just as
the saint earl Rognvald his mother's father had held them.&nbsp; Earl Harold the
young fared west across the sea, and with him Sigurd mannikin, the son of Ivar
the bitter.&nbsp; The mother of Ivar was a daughter of Havard Gunni's
son;&nbsp; that Ivar fell at Akkra with Erling wryneck.&nbsp; Sigurd mannikin
was young of years and the most promising of men, and most showy in his
dress.&nbsp; Magnus nobody stayed behind with the king, and fell with him in
Sogn.&nbsp; They came first to Shetland, and thence fared to Caithness, and so
up into Scotland to find William the Scot-king.&nbsp; Earl Harold begged that
William would give him half of Caithness, just as earl Rognvald, had held
it.&nbsp; The king granted him that.&nbsp; Thence earl Harold fared down to
Caithness, and gathered force together thence.&nbsp; Then came to him Lifolf
bald-pate, his brother in law;&nbsp; he had there many noble men of those who
were his kinsfolk.&nbsp; Lifolf had to wife Ragnhilda the earl's sister.&nbsp;
This [Harold]was called earl Harold the young, (10) but Harold Maddad's son
[was called] the old.&nbsp; Lifolf had most to do with his plans of all the
earl's followers.&nbsp; They made men go out into the Orkneys to find earl
Harold the old, and begged that he would give up half the isles as the king had
granted them to earl Harold the young.&nbsp; But when those words came before
the earl, then he refused short off to share his realm by any such
settlement.&nbsp; Then Lifold bald-pate went on the same journey, and the earl
threatened him very much ere he went away.&nbsp; Earl Harold the old drew force
together after that, and got about him a very great band of men.&nbsp; Earl
Harold the young and his men were in Caithness, and had gathered some men
there.&nbsp; When they heard that earl Harold the old was gathering force, then
they sent Lifolf again afresh north over the Pentland firth to spy out about
the host.&nbsp; He ran in from the east to Rognvaldsey, and went up there on
the fell, and found there three warders of earl Harold the old, and two they
slew, but had one with them to ask the news.&nbsp; Lifolf saw then the earl's
host too, and he had many ships, and most of them big.&nbsp; Then Lifolf turned
down from the fell and took to his ship, and told his messmates such tidings as
he had become ware of.&nbsp; He said that earl Harold had so large a host, that
it was no good teir fighting with him.&nbsp; "It is my counsel," says
Lifolf, "that we fare this very day north into Thurso, and there we shall
gather a great force today.&nbsp; But if ye will run out to battle with earl
Harold, then that is the greatest risk, however ye set about it."&nbsp;
Then Sigurd mannikin took up the word, and said:&nbsp; "In an evil hour
hath the earl's brother in law fared over the Pentland firth, when he hath left
his heart behind him,"&nbsp; and said it was a sorry outlook if all were
to become heartless as soon as ever they saw old Harold's host.&nbsp; Lifolf
answered:&nbsp; "'Tis hard to see, Sigurd, where each man keeps his heart,
if there is need to call on it.&nbsp; I ween that hour on which I run from
young Harold, that ye fine men with your braveries will find it hard work to
stand behind."&nbsp; But nothing came of the voyage to Thurso.&nbsp; But a
little while after they saw earl Harold's fleet of ships sailing away from
Rognvaldsey;&nbsp; then they busked them for battle.&nbsp; Earl Harold [the
old] went on shore, and drew up his men in array;&nbsp; he had a far greater
host.&nbsp; Those, Sigurd mannikin and Lifolf, drew up the young earl's
host.&nbsp; Sigurd mannikin was in a red scarlet kirtle, and he tucked in the
skirts under his belt.&nbsp; Some men said that he should do so at his back
too.&nbsp; He bade them not turn the skirts up, "for I shall have to go
straight forward today."&nbsp; Each of these [Lifolf and Sigurd] was at
his own wing of the battle.&nbsp; And when they had drawn up their band the
fight was joined, and was very hard and hot.&nbsp; In earl Harold the old's
force were many of the toughest and hardest men, they who were mighty men of
valour and very well boun, as were the bishop's kinsfolk and many other of the
chiefs of the earl's train.&nbsp; When the battle had stood a while Sigurd
mannikin fell, and he had fought well and manfully.&nbsp; Lifolf, of all the
other men, went best forward.&nbsp; So say the Caithness men, that he went
thrice through earl Harold the old's battle array, but still at last he fell in
that fight with good fame.&nbsp; When they were both fallen, Lifolf and Sigurd
mannikin, flight broke out among the force of the young earl.&nbsp; Earl Harold
the young fell by some turf ditches;&nbsp; then at once at night was seen a
great light where his blood had fallen.&nbsp; They call the earl a very saint,
and there is now a church where he fell, and he is buried there on the Ness,
and untold tokens are granted of God to be done for his worthiness' sake;&nbsp;
and that shows clearly that he wished to go over to the Orkneys to his kinsmen
earl Magnus and earl Rognvald.&nbsp; After the battle earl Harold laid under
him all Caithness, and fared at once out to the Orkneys and boasted of a great
victory. (11)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William the Scot-king heard that earl Harold
was fallen, and that too how earl Harold Maddad's son had laid under him all
Caithness, and had not asked his leave.&nbsp; At this the Scot-king was very
wrath, and sends men into the Southern isles to Rognvalds Godred's son, the
king of the Southern isles.&nbsp; Godred's mother was Ingibjorg, daughter of
earl Hacon Paul's son.&nbsp; King Rognvald was then the greatest warrior in the
western lands.&nbsp; Three winters long it was that he lay out on board his
warships, and never once came under sooty rafter.&nbsp; As soon as ever these
words came to Rognvald, he drew together a host over all the realm of the
Southern isles and from Cantire;&nbsp; he had too a great force from
Ireland.&nbsp; Then he held on his course north to Caithness, and took all the
land under him, and stayed there a while.&nbsp; Earl Harold sat in the Orkneys
and gave no heed to the king's doings.&nbsp; But when the winter came on king
Rognvald busked him home to his realm in the Southern isles.&nbsp; He set up
behind him in Caithness three stewards;&nbsp; one was Mani Olaf's son, the
secon Rafn the lawman, Hlifolf the quick was the name of the third.&nbsp; Some
time after that king Rognvald fared away to the Southern isles, earl Harold
sent a man over to the Ness, and said that he thought his errand would turn out
good if he could get one of those stewards slain, or all three.&nbsp; This man
was put across the Pentland firth;&nbsp; he went about till he met Rafn the
lawman, and Rafn asked whither he was going.&nbsp; He was slow to answer.&nbsp;
Rafn took up the word, and said:&nbsp; "I see that on thy face that earl
Harold has sent thee hither to the Ness for some ill, but I cannot find it in
my heart to slay thee, for thou art my kinsman."&nbsp; With this they
parted, and he fared away thence, and came to Hlifolf's house, and the upshot
of their dealings was that he made an end of Hlifolf.&nbsp; Then he ran away
and out to the Orkneys to find earl Harold, and told him what he had done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Harold busks him now for a voyage out of
the Orkneys, and when he was all boun, he fared first north [south] to Thurso
and landed there from his ships.&nbsp; The bishop was in the burg at
Scrabster.&nbsp; And when they saw earl Harold's host, those Caithness men saw
that he had so great a host that they could in nowise withstand him.&nbsp; It
was also told them that the earl was in such a bad frame of mind, that there
was no saying whom he would spare.&nbsp; Then the bishop took up the word, and
said:&nbsp; "If the meeting of us two goes off well, then he will give you
peace."&nbsp; It was done as the bishop laid down.&nbsp; The earl's host
rushed from the ships and to the burg.&nbsp; The bishop went to meet the earl,
and greeted him with soft words, but the end of their meeting was, that the
earl made them seize the bishop, and cut the tongue out of him, but after that
he made them stick a knife into his eyes and blind him.&nbsp; Bishop John
called on the holy maid St. Trollh&aelig;na (St. Triduana or St. Tredwall) in his
maiming, and went afterwards on a certain cliff as soon as ever they let him
loose.&nbsp; There was a woman on the cliff, and the bishop prayed her to help
him.&nbsp; She saw that blood fell from his face, and said:&nbsp; "Be thou
still, lord, for I will help thee with all my heart."&nbsp; The bishop was
brought to that place where the holy Trollh&aelig;na rests;&nbsp; there the bishop
got a cure both for his speech and sight.&nbsp; Earl Harold went then up to the
burg, and they gave it over at once into the earl's power.&nbsp; He visited men
there and then with great chastisments, and laid on those men great fines whom
he thought had been most in the treason against him.&nbsp; He made all the
Caithness men then come again under him with oaths, whether it were lieve or
loath to them;&nbsp; after that he seized as his own all those estates which
the stewards had owned who had fared to find the Scot-king.&nbsp; Then earl
Harold sat there in Caithness with much folk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is to be told of the stewards.&nbsp;
They made up their minds, six of them together, to go up to Scotland, and found
the king there during the winter at the Yule fast [Advent];&nbsp; then they
could tell him plainly of all these tidings which had been done in Caithness on
earl Harold's journey.&nbsp; At these tidings the king was very wrath, but he
said they should pay double fines who had left his side.&nbsp; The first day
that they were with the Scot-king he made them give to each of them five and
twenty ells of cloth, and besides an English mark as travelling silver to each
man of them.&nbsp; They were there with the Scot-king in good cheer on over
Yule.&nbsp; But at once at the back of Yule the Scot-king sends word to all the
chiefs in his realm, and drew together a very mighty host all over the land,
and marched with that host straight down on Caithness to attack earl
Harold.&nbsp; The Scot-king had a very great host, and he fares till he comes
into Eystein's dale, there Caithness and Sutherland meet.&nbsp; The camp of the
Scot-king stretched all along from each end of the dale, and that is a long
way.&nbsp; Earl Harold was in Caithness when he heard these tidings.&nbsp; He
drew together a force to him at once, and so it is said of it, that he got
sixty hundred men, and yet had no power to withstand the Scot-king in
fight.&nbsp; Then he sent men to find the Scot-king to try to make an atonement
with him.&nbsp; But when that was brought before the king, he said that there
was no need to look for an atonement unless he had every fourth penny from
Caithness that was in the land.&nbsp; But when this message came before earl
Harold, he called the landsmen to talk to him, and the other chiefs, and sought
counsel of them.&nbsp; But with that, that they saw there was no way out of
their difficulties, they came into that atonement that all the Caithness men
should pay a fourth of their property to the Scot-king, save and except those
men who had gone to find the king that winter.&nbsp; Earl Harold fared out to
the Orkneys, and was to have all Caithness as he had had it before that earl
Harold the young took it from the Scot-king.&nbsp; In that strife was blinded
Thorfinn son of earl Harold;&nbsp; he had been taken as a hostage by the
Scot-king.&nbsp; After that atonement the king fared up into Scotland.&nbsp;
Earl Harold was now sole chief in the Orkneys.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was towards the end of earl Harold's days
that Olaf his son in law and John Halkel's son gathered a band out of the
Orkneys, and went east to Norway against king Sverrir.&nbsp; They chose for
their king Sigurd son of king Magnus Erling's son.&nbsp; With that host many
men of high birth out of the Orkneys threw in their lot.&nbsp; That was one of
the strongest bands.&nbsp; They were called the Island lads, and for a while
Goldshanks.&nbsp; They fought at Floravoe against king Sverrir and got the
worst of it.&nbsp; There fell both John and Olaf and their king as well, and
the most part of the host.&nbsp; After that king Sverrir laid great feud at
earl Harold's door, and said it was all his doing that that band had got
together.&nbsp; So it came about that earl Harold fared from the west, and
bishop Bjarni with him.&nbsp; The earl gave himself over into king Sverrir's
power, and let him alone shear and shape all matters between them.&nbsp; Then
king Sverrir decreed that all Shetland should fall from earl Harold with scatt
and shot, and the Orkney earls have had not that land since.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earl Harold was then five winters old when
the title of earl was given him.&nbsp; He was twenty winters earl;&nbsp; so
that he and the saint earl Rognvald were both together earls over the
Orkneys.&nbsp; After earl Rognvald's fall, Harold was earl in the Orkneys forty
eight winters.&nbsp; He breathed his last in the second year of the reign of
king Ingi Bard's son.&nbsp; After earl Harold his sons John and David took his
realm.&nbsp; His son Henry has Ross in Scotland.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These have been the most mighty of the
Orkneyingers' earls after the telling of those men who have made stories about
them;&nbsp; Sigurd Eystein's son is there named;&nbsp; earl Thorfinn Sigurd's
son;&nbsp; earl Harold Maddad's son.&nbsp; Those brothers John and David both
ruled the lands after their father, till David breathed his last of sickness in
that year on which Hacon the silly breathed his last in Norway.&nbsp; After
that John took the title of earl over all the Orkneys.</p>
