<p align="center">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW NORWAY WAS
INHABITED.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now shall be told the
proofs how Norway was first inhabited;&nbsp; or how kingly stocks began there
or in other lands;&nbsp; or why they are called Skjoldungs, Budlungs, Bragnings,
&Ouml;dlings, V&ouml;lsungs, or Niflungs, from which the royal races have come: ----</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a man called
Fornjot.&nbsp; He had three sons;&nbsp; one was Hler, another Logi, the third
Kari;&nbsp; he ruled over winds, but Logi over fire, Hler over the seas.&nbsp;
Kari was the father of J&ouml;kull, the father of king Snow.&nbsp; But the children
of king Snow were these:&nbsp; Thorri, F&ouml;nn, Drifa, and Mjol.&nbsp; Thorri was
a noble king;&nbsp; he ruled over Gothland, Kvenland, and Finland.&nbsp;
To him the Kvens sacrificed that it might be snowy, and that there might be
good going on snow-shoon.&nbsp; That was their harvest.&nbsp; That sacrifice
was to be at midwinter;&nbsp; and the month Thorri was called after it.&nbsp;
King Thorri had three children;&nbsp; his sons were named Norr and Gorr, but
the daughter Goi.&nbsp; Goi was lost and gone;&nbsp; and Thorri made a
sacrifice a month later than he was wont to sacrifice;&nbsp; and they
afterwards called that month in which this began Goi.&nbsp; Those two, Norr and
Gorr, searched for their sister.&nbsp; Norr had great battles west of the Keel,
and those kings fell before him who are so called:&nbsp; Vee and Vei, Hunding
and Heming;&nbsp; and Norr laid under him that land all to the sea.&nbsp; Those
brothers met in that firth which is now called Norafirth.&nbsp; Norr fared
thence up on the Keel and came to a place called Wolves-moor.&nbsp; Thence he
fared round Eystridale and afterwards into Vermland, and along the lake called
V&aelig;ner, and so to the sea.&nbsp; And all that land Norr laid under him west of
those bounds.&nbsp; That land is now called Nor-way.&nbsp; At mid winter they
came into Heidmark (Hedemark).&nbsp; There that king met them who was called
Rolf of the Hill;&nbsp; he was the son of Svadi the giant from north of Dofra
and of Ashilda daughter of king Eystein who had long ruled over Heidmark.&nbsp;
Rolf of the Hill had seized Goi, and gone on to marry her.&nbsp; But when she
heard of her brother Norr, then she fared to meet him, and Rolf with her;&nbsp;
and he gave himself up into Norr's power, and was made his man.&nbsp; After
that Norr went to a feast at his brother in law's, and Norr got to wife Hodda,
a daughter of Svadi the giant, Rolf's sister.&nbsp; After that king Norr fared
back west to the sea, and then he finds his brother Gorr.&nbsp; He was then
come from the north out of the Frozen-sea, and had seized as his own all the
isles on that way, both inhabited and uninhabited.&nbsp; Then these brothers
shared the realm between them, so that Norr should have all the mainland from
the north from J&ouml;tunheim and south to Alfheim.&nbsp; That is now called Norway;&nbsp;
but Gorr should have all those isles which lay on the larboard of his warship
as he fared north along the land.&nbsp; These were the sons of Gorr the
sea-king:&nbsp; Heiti and Beiti, Meitir and Geitir.&nbsp; Beiti the sea-king
fared with his warship into Drontheim and on into Beit-sea;&nbsp; he made them
make a ship sledge under the galley;&nbsp; but there was deep snow and good
sledging.&nbsp; Then Beitir sat him on the poop, and put the rudder into gear,
and made them hoist the sails;&nbsp; and let his men drag the galley north
across Galley-neck to Naumdale, and claimed as his own all that land that lay
on the larboard.&nbsp; Beiti the sea-king was the father of Heiti the sea-king,
the father of Svadi;&nbsp; but Geitir was the father of Glammi and Gylfi.&nbsp;
Meiti the sea-king was father of M&aelig;vil and Myndill.&nbsp; Myndill was the
father of Ekkill and Skekkill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norr was the father of
these men, but Hodda, the daughter of Svadi, their mother.&nbsp; (Here follow
the royal lineages descended from Norr, the ancestor of all future kings of the
Norwegian Mainland.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To
ch. 12. (From the Flatey Book).</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olaf Tryggvi's son sailed
from the west to the Orkneys, as was said before, but because the Pentland
Firth was not passable, he laid his ship up under the lee in Osmund's voe, off
Rognvald's isle.&nbsp; But there in the voe lay already earl Sigurd, Hlodver's
son, with three ships, and then meant to go a roving.&nbsp; But as soon as king
Olaf knew that the earl was there, he made them call him to come and speak with
him.&nbsp; But when the earl came on board the king's ship, king Olaf began his
speech thus:&nbsp; "It will be known to thee, earl Sigurd, how Harold the
fair-haired fared with his host hither west when he had made all Norway his
own;&nbsp; king Harold won under himself the Orkneys and Shetland, and many a
realm besides here over the western sea;&nbsp; the king gave the isles and
Shetland to his earl Rognvald the mighty as an atonement for his son, but
Rognvald gave them to his brother Sigurd;&nbsp; then Sigurd made himself king
Harold's earl.&nbsp; Another time king Harold fared with a very great host to
fall on earl Einar;&nbsp; then goodwilling men came between them, the king and
Einar;&nbsp; and they made peace on those terms, that the king called his own
all the Orkneys and Shetland.&nbsp; This was the end of their quarrel, that the
earl paid the king sixty marks of gold for the slaying of Halfdon long-leg his
son, but earl Einar held the lands under king Harold.&nbsp; A little while
after king Eric, Harold's son, came from the east from Norway;&nbsp; then the
earls, Turf-Einar's sons, were bound to aid king Eric, and this is a mark of
it, that they gave the king much force for war.&nbsp; But another time, when
king Eric came to the isles, he had away with him two earls Arnkell and Erlend,
and left over the lands earl Thorfinn their brother;&nbsp; but they both fell
in England with king Eric.&nbsp; After that came the sons of Eric from England,
and then they had sway over the isles.&nbsp; But when they were away hence they
made over the lands to earl Arnfinn their brother in law.&nbsp; After that
Havard first took the rule after his brother, then Ljot, last of all Hlodver
thy father.&nbsp; Now hast thou, Sigurd, the earldom over those realms which I
call my owndom, as well as all those other realms which king Harold the
fair-haried once had, and each of his kinsmen have taken as heirs one after the
other.&nbsp; Thou knowest that now the sons of Eric and Gunnhilda are most of
them put out of the way, but though Ragnhilda their sister still lives, yet it
seems to me she must have done so much mischief to the Orkneyingers, that she
can have neither rede nor rule here, but rather hath she utterly forfeited both
life and lands, if all those ill deeds be true which are told of her, as men
think it is much to be feared, and not unlikely that they are.&nbsp; Now as so
it is, earl Sigurd, that things have fallen out so that thou hast come into my
power, now thou hast two choices before thee very uneven;&nbsp; one is that
thou shalt take the right faith, and become my man and allow thyself to be
baptized and all thy undermen;&nbsp; then shalt thou have a sure hope of honour
from me, and to have and to hold as my underman this realm with earl's title
and full freedom as thou hast erewhile had it;&nbsp; and this over and above,
which is much more worth, to rule in everlasting bliss in the kingdom of heaven
with all-ruling God;&nbsp; that is sure to thee if thou keepest all his
commandments.&nbsp; This is the other choice, which is very doleful and unlike
the first, that now on the spot thou shalt die, and after thy death I will let
fire and sword ruthlessly rage over all the Orkneys, burn and brand homesteads
and men, unless this folk will have salvation and believe on the true
God.&nbsp; And now if thou and thy undermen will choose this which was last
named, then must thou, and all those who believe in divers idols, be shamefully
plagued in hell-fire after speedy death with wicked devils without end."&nbsp;
But when earl Sigurd had heard so long and clever a speech of king Olaf, he
hardened his heart against him and spoke thus:&nbsp; "It must be told
thee, king Olaf, that I have firmly made up my mind that I will not, and may
not and shall not forego that faith which my kinsmen and forefathers had before
me, for I know no better counsel than they, and I know not that that faith is
better which thou preachest than this which we have now had and held all our
lives."&nbsp; And with that the king saw the earl so stiffnecked in his error,
he seized his young son, whom the earl had with him, and who had grown up there
in the isles.&nbsp; This son of the earl the king bore foreward on the prow,
and drew his sword, and made ready to cut off the lad's head, with these
words:&nbsp; "Now mayest thou see, earl Sigurd, that I will spare no man
who will not serve Almighty God, or listen to my exhortations and hearken to
this blessed message;&nbsp; and for that I will now on this very spot slay this
thy son before thine eyes, with the same sword which I grasp, unless thou and
thy men serve my God;&nbsp; for hence out of the isles will I not go before I
have forwarded and fulfilled this his glorious errand, and thou and thy son,
whom I now hold, have taken on you baptism."&nbsp; And in the strait to
which the earl was then come, he chose the choice which the king would have,
and which was better for him, to take the right faith.&nbsp; Then the earl was
baptized, and all the folk in the Orkneys.&nbsp; After that earl Sigurd was
made after this world's honour king Olaf's earl, and held under him lands and
fiefs, and gave him for an hostage that some son of his of whom it was spoken
before;&nbsp; he was called Whelp or Hound.&nbsp; Olaf made them christen the
lad by the name of Hlodver, and carried him away with him to Norway.&nbsp; Earl
Sigurd bound with oaths all their agreement, and next after that king Olaf
sailed away from the Orkneys, but set up there behind him priests to mend the
folk's ways and teach them holy wisdom;&nbsp; so they, king Olaf and Sigurd,
parted with friendship.&nbsp; Hlodver lived but a scanty time;&nbsp; but after
that he is dead earl Sigurd showed king Olaf no service.&nbsp; He took to wife
then the daughter of Malcolm, the Scot-king, and Thorfinn was their son.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ch.&nbsp; 30 &amp; 31.&nbsp; (From the
Saga of Magnus the good, ch. 23 in the Hulda).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Magnus gave Rognvald
Brusi's son the title of earl, and sent him to his realm east in the
Orkneys.&nbsp; The king got him men and ships as he needed.&nbsp; He set
himself up in the isles, and had his realm in peace for a while, two shares of
the Orkneys and Shetland;&nbsp; until earl Thorfinn, the uncle of earl
Rognvald, claimed those lands which king Magnus had granted him.&nbsp; Thence
arose disagreement and strife between those kinsmen, as is said in the Earls'
Sagas, until earl Rognvald fled out of the isles before the overbearing might
of earl Thorfinn away east to Norway to find king Magnus.&nbsp; Then the king
again furnished him with ships, and got him the best choice of picked men out
of his bodyguard.&nbsp; He sent also his letters with his seal to Kalf Arni's son;&nbsp;
he had been away west there since he fled the land in Norway, staying with his
connexion earl Thorfinn;&nbsp; he had to wife Ingibjorg earls' mother, the
daughter of Finn Arni's son.&nbsp; That stood in the letters of king Magnus,
that Kalf should get all his estates in Norway, and along with them have the
friendship of king Magnus, if he would give help to earl Rognvald in his
quarrel with earl Thorfinn.&nbsp; But when Kalf had heard the letter he said
little to show that he was pleased, but still answered, "Methinks,"
he says, "there is great risk in the steadfastness of temper of king
Magnus.&nbsp; Before when I laid myself out to make friends with him in
everything, I was backbitten so that I had fly out of Norway, for my life was
at stake."&nbsp; Earl Rognvald said "Thou must have heard this that
the king has now forgiven all men that great quarrel in which he thought the
liegemen were most guilty againt him, and has now become dearly beloved by
every man;&nbsp; and thence it is sure that thou mayst get great honour from
the king, if thou farest to meet him, for he is fast in all good
promises."&nbsp; So it was as though it all went out at Kalf's other ear,
though he heard such things spoken.&nbsp; But when earl Thorfinn heard that
earl Rognvald was come into the isles, he gathered to him a great force and
fared against him.&nbsp; They met at the place called Redhead and fought, and
it went better for earl Rognvald.&nbsp; Then Kalf ran up at last with six or
seven longships on the side of earl Thorfinn his connexion, because of his
egging on and reproaches.&nbsp; Then Thorfinn won the day.&nbsp; And afterwards
the quarrel of the earls fared as is told in their Saga.&nbsp; After that
battle Kalf Arni's son went out sea roving and became a viking in the western
sea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ch. 34 (From Fl. Book, col. 490).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where they were standing
there were berries on a mound.&nbsp; The king takes the berries and squeezes
them in his palm.&nbsp; Then the king saw where the banner of the freemen was
set up.&nbsp; Then he spoke and said, "Wretched berries," quoth
he.&nbsp; Rognvald Brusi's son answers, "You made a slip of the tongue
just now, king, you must have meant to say 'people.'"&nbsp; "Thou
sayest right, earl," quoth the king, "Thou wilt not make a less slip
of the tongue when thou hast but a short time to live."&nbsp; That
happened afterwards, as is said in the Earls' Sagas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ch. 89-97 (From king Ingi's Saga in the
Hulda ch. 17).</p>
