<p align="center">THE STORY OF EARL MAGNUS</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now (7) the sons of earl Thorfinn
took the realm after him.&nbsp; Paul was the elder of them, and he took the
lead over them.&nbsp; They did not share the lands between them, and yet were a
very long time well agreed in their dealings.&nbsp; Ingibjorg earlsmother gave
herself away, after the death of earl Thorfinn, to Malcolm the Scot-king, who
was called long-neck;&nbsp; their son was Duncan the Scot-king, father of
William the nobleman.&nbsp; His son&#146;s name again was William the prince, whom
all the Scots wished to take for the king.&nbsp; Earl Paul, Thorfinn&#146;s son, got
to wife the daughter of earl Hacon Ivar&#146;s son, and they had many
children.&nbsp; Their son&#146;s name was Hacon.&nbsp; They had a daughter whose
name was Thora;&nbsp; she was given away in Norway to Haldor, the son of
Brynjulf (the old) camel.&nbsp; Their son&#146;s name was Brynjulf;&nbsp; his son&#146;s
name was Haldor, who had to wife Gyrid Dag&#146;s daughter.&nbsp; Another daughter
of Paul&#146;s was named Ingirid, whom Einar Vorsacrow had to wife.&nbsp; Herbjorg
was the name of Paul&#146;s third daughter;&nbsp; she was the mother of Ingibjorg
the honourable, whom Sigurd of Westness had to wife, and their sons were Hacon
pick and Brynjulf.&nbsp; Sigrid was another daughter of Herbjorg, the mother of
Hacon bairn and Herborg, whom Kolbeinn the burly had to wife.&nbsp; Ragnhilda
was the name of a fourth daughter of earl Paul, she was the mother of Benedict,
the father of Ingibjorg, the mother of Erling the archdeacon.&nbsp; Bergliot
was the name of another ? daughter of Ragnhilda, whom Havard Gunni&#146;s son had to
wife;&nbsp; their sons were Magnus and Hacon claw, and Dufnjal and
Thorstein.&nbsp; These are all earls&#146; kin, and noblemen in the Orkneys, and all
these men come into the story afterwards.&nbsp; Earl Erlend Thorfinn&#146;s son had
to wife that woman whose name was Thora and was the daughter of Summerled the
son of Ospak.&nbsp; The mother of Ospak was Thordis, daughter of Hall o&#146; the
Side.&nbsp; Erling and Magnus were their (Erlend&#146;s and Thora&#146;s) sons, but their
daughters were Gunnhilda and Cecilia, whom Isaac had to wife, and their sons
(Cecilia&#146;s and Isaac&#146;s), were Endridi and Kol.&nbsp; Jatvor was the name of a
base-born daughter of Erlend, her son&#146;s name was Borgar.</p>

<p>40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When those brothers Paul and Erlend
had taken the rule in the Orkneys, Harold Sigurd&#146;s son came from the east out
of Norway with a great host.&nbsp; He came first to Shetland.&nbsp; Thence he
fared to the Orkneys.&nbsp; There he left behind him Elspeth his queen and
their daughters Maria and Ingigerd.&nbsp; Out of the Orkneys he had much force.&nbsp;
Both the earls made ready to go with the king.&nbsp; The king fared thence
south to England, and landed in the place called Cleveland, and won
Scarborough.&nbsp; After that he ran in at Hallorness, and had there a battle
and won the victory.&nbsp; On the mid-week day (Wednesday) next before Matthiasmass
he had a battle in York against earls Waltheof and Morcar.&nbsp; There Morcar
fell.&nbsp; The Sunday after that burg was given into the power of king Harold
which stood by Stamford-bridge.&nbsp; The Monday after he went on land to
settle things in the town.&nbsp; At the ships he left behind him his son Olaf,
and earls Paul and Erlend, and Eystein gorcock his brother-in-law, and Thorberg
Arni&#146;s son.&nbsp; In that land journey came Harold, Godwin&#146;s son, against king
Harold with an overwhelming host.&nbsp; A great battle arose at once, and in
that battle fell Harold Sigurd&#146;s son.&nbsp; After the king&#146;s fall came Eystein
gorcock from the ships, and the earls, and made a very hard onslaught.&nbsp;
That battle was called the gorcock&#146;s storm or the gorcock&#146;s bout.&nbsp; There
fell Eystein gorcock and well nigh the whole host of the Northmen.&nbsp; After
those fights king Harold gave Olaf Harold&#146;s son, and the earls leave to go away
out of England, and also to all that host that had not already fled.&nbsp; Olaf
sailed out about autumn from Ravensere, and so to the Orkneys.&nbsp; And there
they heard these tidings, that on that day and at that hour when Harold fell,
his daughter Maria died a sudden death, and it is the talk of men that they
have had but one man&#146;s life between them.&nbsp; Olaf was that winter in the
Orkneys, and he was the greatest friend of the earls his kinsmen.&nbsp; They
were brother&#146;s daughters, Thora king Olaf&#146;s mother and Ingibjorg the earls&#146;
mother.&nbsp; Olaf fared when the spring came east to Norway, and was there
taken to be king with Magnus his brother.</p>

<p>But when those brothers ruled the Orkneys, then was their agreement great
and good a long while.&nbsp; But when their sons began to grow up, then they
became very overbearing men, Hacon and Erling.&nbsp; Magnus was the quietest
tempered of them.&nbsp; They were all of them tall and strong, and proper men
in all things.&nbsp; Hacon, Paul&#146;s son, would be the leader over those brothers
(his cousins);&nbsp; he thought he was more by birth than the sons of Erlend,
because he was the daughter&#146;s son of earl Hacon Ivar&#146;s son and Ragnhilda
daughter of king Magnus the good.&nbsp; Hacon would have it that his friends
should have a larger lot when there was anything to share than they allowed to
the sons of Erlend;&nbsp; but Erlend would not that his sons should have the
worst of it there in the isles.&nbsp; Then it so came about that those kinsmen
could not be together in peace, and there was danger with them.&nbsp; Then
their fathers took a share in the matter;&nbsp; they were to try and make
matters up;&nbsp; then a meeting was fixed, and it was soon found out that each
of them leant towards his own sons, and they could make no settlement.&nbsp;
Now disagreement arose between those brothers, and they parted bad friends, and
that many thought great scathe.</p>

adds, &#8220;and got a fair wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fl.
adds, &#8220;Thorkell made him captive, and bade men put an end to the earl, and
offered them money to do it;&nbsp; but no one would do it any more for
money.&nbsp; Then Thorkell did the deed himself, for that he knew that one or
other of them must bow before the other.&nbsp; Then earl Thorfinn came up, and
did not blame the deed.&#8221;</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fl.
has here left out a long passage which runs thus in the Danish
translation:&nbsp; &#8220;But to kjing Sweyn he gave Denmark.&nbsp; He also sent his
brother Thorir and many other of his friends whom he wished to be well treated
to king Sweyn.&nbsp; But after king Magnus was dead, king Harold gave out that
he would make for Veborg Thing, and let himself be chosen there king over all
Denmark;&nbsp; and said that then the Norwegians would be for ever over the
Danes, and made a long speech about it.&nbsp; But Einar Paunchshaker answered
him, and said, &#145;It is more to my mind, and I am more bound, to bear the body of
king Magnus north to Norway to the saint king Olaf, his father, than to fight
along with king Harold for other kings&#146; realms.&#146;&nbsp; And at the same time he
ended his speech by saying he thought it better to follow king Magnus dead than
any other king alive;&nbsp; and there and then Einar went to his ship, and as he
went all the chiefs whose homes lay north of Stad in Norway, went with
him.&nbsp; Then king Harold saw no other way than to sail first to Norway, and
first take the kingdom under him.&nbsp; King Sweyn was in Skan&ouml;r at the time
that he heard that king Magnus was dead.&nbsp; He had it then in his mind to
ride east into Sweden, and to give up the name of king which he had
taken;&nbsp; and just as he was ready to start there came a man to him who told
him that king Magnus was dead, and all the Norwegian host had gone out of Denmark.&nbsp;
Then king Sweyn swore by God that he would never give up Denmark for any man so
long as he was alive.&nbsp; Then he crossed over to Zealand, and laid the realm
under him wherever he came.&nbsp; There he met Thorir and many other of king
Magnus&#146; men whom he had sent together.&nbsp; He took very kindly to them, and
Thorir was with him a long time afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty
would seem to be the true reading, for Thorfinn seems to have reigned from AD
1014 till 1064, in which latter year the earl apears to have died.</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here
begins the second part of the Orkneyingers&#146; Saga, containing an abridgement of
the Life of St. Magnus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that kindly men came
between them, and seek to settle things;&nbsp; so there was a peace-meeting
fixed for them in Hrossey.&nbsp; At that meeting a settlement was made in this
way, that then the isles were shared into halves as they had been between
Thorfinn and Brusi.&nbsp; So things stood awhile.&nbsp; Hacon was then almost
always away war-roving since he had grown up.&nbsp; He became then a very
overbearing man, and they (Hacon and his men) were hard on those men who served
under those kinmen, Erlend and his sons.&nbsp; So it came about again that the
settlement was broken, and they fared against each other a great force.&nbsp;
Havard Gunni&#146;s son and all the other noblemen of the earls came one day between
them and again brought them together and tried to bring about a settlement.&nbsp;
Then Erlend and his sons would not make matters up, so that Hacon was to be
there in the isles.&nbsp; But because it seemed to their friends that there was
great risk in their quarrels, then they prayed Hacon not to let this stand in
the way of peace;&nbsp; but that he would rather fare away out of the
isles.&nbsp; They said it would be good counsel if he fared east across the sea
to visit his kinsmen, both in Norway and Sweden.&nbsp; And at the beseeching of
his men, and also that Hacon was envious of his kinsmen there in the isles, and
thought it good to learn the ways of other chiefs, then he granted them their
prayer that he would fare away at once out of the isles.&nbsp; Then the
settlement was again made by the counsel of good men.&nbsp; After that Hacon
fared away out of the isles, first east to Norway, and he found there king Olaf
the quiet.&nbsp; This was about the end of his days.&nbsp; There Hacon stayed
some time.&nbsp; After that he fared east to Sweden to see king Ingi,
Steinkel&#146;s son, and he made him welcome.&nbsp; He found there his friends and
kinsmen.&nbsp; He reaped there the greatest honour from the friendships of
Hacon, his mother&#146;s father.&nbsp; He had held rule there from Steinkel, the
Swede king, after he had to fly the land before king Harold Sigurd&#146;s son.&nbsp;
He had grown there to be the greatest friend, both of the king and the men of
the land.&nbsp; Another daughter&#146;s son of earl Hacon Ivar&#146;s son, was Hacon, who
called the Northman;&nbsp; he was father of Eric the wise, who was king in
Denmark after king Eric the ever-memorable.&nbsp; Hacon stayed in Sweden a
while, and king Ingi was good to him.&nbsp; But when things had gone on so a
while then home-sickness came over him to seek west to the isles.&nbsp;
Christianity was then young in Sweden;&nbsp; there were then many men who went
about with witchcraft, and thought by that to become wise and knowing of many
things which had not yet come to pass.&nbsp; King Ingi was a thorough Christian
man, and all wizards were loathsome to him.&nbsp; He took great pains to root
out those evil ways which had long gone hand in hand with heathendom, but the
rulers of the land and the great freeholders took it ill that their bad customs
were found fault with.&nbsp; So it came about that the freemen chose them
another king, Sweyn, the queen&#146;s brother, who still held to his sacrifices to
idols, and was called Sacrifice-Sweyn.&nbsp; Before him king Ingi was forced to
fly the land into West-Gothland;&nbsp; but the end of their dealings was, that
king Ingi took the house over Sweyn&#146;s head and burnt him inside it.&nbsp; After
that he took all the land under him.&nbsp; Then he still went on rooting out
many bad ways.</p>

<p>42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Hacon Paul&#146;s son was in Sweden,
he had heard say that there in the land was a man who went about with wisdom
and spaedom, whether he got it by witchcraft or other things.&nbsp; He had a
great longing to find out this man, and to know whether he could be made wise
as to his future fate.&nbsp; And after that he fared to that man, and found him
at last dwelling in the woods.&nbsp; There he used to go about to feasts, and
told the freemen about their crops and other things.&nbsp; But when he found
that man, then he asked him he might come to power or other good luck.&nbsp;
The wizard asked him what manner of man he was.&nbsp; He told him his name and
kin, that he was the daughter&#146;s son of Hacon Ivar&#146;s son.&nbsp; Then said the
wizard:&nbsp; &#8220;Why wilt thou take of me wisdom or sayings;&nbsp; thou knowest
that those kinsmen of thine of old have had little mind for such like men as I
am,&nbsp; and it may serve thy need that thou shouldest seek to know thy fate
from Olaf the stout, they kinsman, the king of Norway, whom ye set all faith
in.&nbsp; But I rather doubt that he would not have humble-mindness enough to
tell thee what thou art eager to know, or perhaps be not so mighty either as ye
say he is.&#8221;&nbsp; Then Hacon answers:&nbsp; &#8220;I will not speak ill of him.&nbsp;
I think it more likely that I may not have worthiness enough to take wisdom
from him, than that he may not be so powerful, that for that reason I should
not take wisdom from him.&nbsp; But this is why I have come to see thee,
because it hath come into my mind that here neither of us will need to envy the
other for the sake of matters of virtue or belief.&#8221;&nbsp; That man
answers:&nbsp; &#8220;It likes me well that I find that thou thinkest that thou hast
all trust where I am, and before that faith which ye have followed, you and
your other kinsmen.&nbsp; So it is, too, that with you those who lay themselves
out for such things go wondrously to work.&nbsp; They go about with fasts and
wakes, and deem that therefore those things must be granted to them which they
are eager to know.&nbsp; But though they take such pains, yet are they all the
less wise of what they desire to know, the more they mix themselves up with
them;&nbsp; but we lay ourselves under no penance, and yet we are always wise
as to those things of which our friends think it worth while that they should
not go on in ignorance.&nbsp; Now things will so go with us two that thou shalt
get this gain from me, as I see clearly that thou thinkest thyself better able
to get the truth from me than from king Ingi&#146;s priestly teachers, whom he
thinks he may put all trust in.&nbsp; Thou shalt come in three nights&#146; space,
and then we two will try if I can tell thee anything which thou art eager to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that they part, and Hacon stays there in those parts, and when three
nights were gone by he fared to meet the wizard.&nbsp; He was then in a certain
house all alone, and drew his breath heavily when he (Hacon) went in, stroked
his brow with his hand, and said it cost him much ere he became wise of those
things which he was to know beforehand.&nbsp; Hacon says he was willing to hear
his future fate.&nbsp; The spaeman began to say:&nbsp; &#8220;If thou wilt know thy
fate, then is it long to tell about, for that it is great and because from thy
life and labour very great tidings will come to pass;&nbsp; and it is my belief
that thou wilt come to be sole chief over the Orkneys at last, but it may be
that thou wilt think it long to wait.&nbsp; I trow, also, that thy offspring
will rule there.&nbsp; But from thy western voyage, which thou farest next of
all to the Orkneys, very great tidings will come about when those things are
fulfilled which will spring from it.&nbsp; Thou wilt also in thy days let that
wickedness be done which thou must either make atonement for or not to that God
in whom thou believest.&nbsp; But thy footsteps lie further out into the world
than I can get to see, but still I think that thou wilt bring back thy bones
here to the northern half of the world.&nbsp; Now have I told thee those things
that I can at this time, and now say how thou wilt like thy day&#146;s work.&#8221;&nbsp;
Hacon answers:&nbsp; &#8220;A great story is this thou tellest, if it be sooth, but I
think it will go better with my lot than thou sayest.&nbsp; May be, too, that
thou has not seen all this of a truth.&#8221;&nbsp; The spaeman bade him believe it
or not as he chose, but said that it would come to pass.</p>

<p>43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that Hacon went away to see king
Ingi, and stayed with him a short time ere he set his heart on faring to the
western lands.&nbsp; Then he took leave of the king to go away.&nbsp; Hacon
fared first to Norway to see his kinsman king Magnus, and he made him
welcome.&nbsp; Then he learnt those tidings from the Orkneys, that earl Erlend
and his sons had it almost all their own way there, and had won very many
friends, but Paul his father had little or nothing to do with ruling the
land.&nbsp; He thought, too, he made out from those men who came from the west,
and in whose words he could put most faith, that the Orkneyingers would long
very little for his coming thither west;&nbsp; for they had already good peace
and quietness, but feared if Hacon came west that strife and uproar would arise
from him.&nbsp; But when Hacon thought of this to himself, then he thought it
not unlikely that those kinsmen would hold the realm from him, but let it not
be without risk to him if he came thither west without a great force.&nbsp; So
he took that counsel to seek to king Magnus that he would bring him to power in
the Orkneys.</p>

<p>This was after that king Magnus had made them put to death Steigar-Thorir
and Egil, and freed the land from all strife.&nbsp; Hacon was a wise man, and
he thought he could see by king Magnus&#146; talk when they spoke together, that the
king would be high-minded and eager to attack the realms of other chiefs.&nbsp;
Hacon fell to saying this before the king, that it would be a brave deed for a
prince to have out the levy and harry west across the sea, and lay the isles
under him, as Harold fair-hair did.&nbsp; Says, too, if he could get rule in
the Southern isles, it would be handy to harry thence in Ireland and
Scotland;&nbsp; and if he put the western lands under him, that thence it would
be good to strive with the strength of the Northmen against the Englishmen,
&#8220;and so avenge Harold Sigurd&#146;s son, thy father&#146;s father.&#8221;&nbsp; But when they
spoke of this, it was found that this jumped well with the king&#146;s temper;&nbsp;
he said it was well and bravely spoken, and near his mind.&nbsp; &#8220;But that thou
shalt keep in mind Hacon,&#8221; says the king, &#8220;if I were to do this after thy words
and egging on, to fare with a host west over the sea, that it must not come on
thee unawares, though I bore on with a bold claim to those realms which lie
away there west, and make in that no distinction of men.&#8221;&nbsp; But when Hacon
heard this utterance, he grew cold and said very little more about it, and
doubted for what these words could be spoken.&nbsp; He left off after that
egging on the king to any voyage;&nbsp; but then little was needed, for after
this speech the king sent messengers over all his realm that the levy should be
out.&nbsp; He laid it bare before all the people that he meant to hold on with
that host west over the sea, whatever tidings might happen afterwards in his
voyages.&nbsp; So men made ready for this voyage all over the land.&nbsp; King
Magnus had with him his son on this voyage, eight winters old, whose name was
Sigurd;&nbsp; he was much of a man for his years.</p>

<p>44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When those brothers Paul and Erlend
ruled over the Orkneys, king Magnus, the son of Olaf the quiet, came from the
east out of Norway.&nbsp; He had a mighty host, and many liegemen followed
him.&nbsp; Vidkun Johnson, Sigurd Hranis&#146; son, Sark out of Sogn, Dag Eilif&#146;s
son, Skopti of Gizki, &#338;gmund, Finn, and Thord;&nbsp; Eyvind elbow the king&#146;s
marshal.&nbsp; There was also Kali of Agdir Seabear&#146;s son, the son of Thorleif
the wise, whom Hallfred maimed, and Kol his son.&nbsp; Kali was a very wise
man, and dear to the king, and a good rhymer.&nbsp; Now when king Magnus came
to the Orkneys, then he seized the earls Paul and Erlend, and sent them east to
Norway, but set up his son Sigurd over the isles, and gave him
councillors.&nbsp;&nbsp; King Magnus fared to the Southern isles and the earls&#146;
sons, Magnus and Erling, sons of earl Erlend, and Hacon, Paul&#146;s son, went along
with him.&nbsp; But when king Magnus came into the isles, he fell to harrying
first in the Lewes, and won them;&nbsp; and in that voyage he won all the
Southern isles, and took captive L&ouml;gman, the son of Gudred, the king of the
Southern isles.&nbsp; Thence he fared south under Bretland (Wales), and had a
great battle in Anglesey-sound with two British earls, Hugh the stout and Hugh
the proud.&nbsp; They were brothers of Costnami, who was then king in Ireland
in Ulster.&nbsp; And when men were getting out their weapons and busking themselves
for the fight, Magnus, Erlend&#146;s son, sate him down aft in the forecastle, and
did not arm himself.&nbsp; The king asked why he sate.&nbsp; He said he had no
quarrel with any man there;&nbsp; &#8220;that&#146;s why I will not fight.&#8221;&nbsp; The king
said:&nbsp; &#8220;Get thee away down under the thwarts, and don&#146;t lie here before
men&#146;s feet, if thou darest not to fight, for I do not think that faith drives
thee to this.&#8221;&nbsp; Magnus took a psalter, and sung while the battle lasted,
but did not shield himself.&nbsp; This battle was both hard and long, and both
spears were thrown and blows struck;&nbsp; it was long so that it could not be
seen between them which way the fight would turn.&nbsp; King Magnus shot with a
crossbow, and another man from Helgeland by his side.&nbsp; Hugh the proud
fought most sturdily;&nbsp; he was so clad and byrnied that there was no bare
spot on him save the eyes.&nbsp; King Magnus bade the man from Helgeland that
they should both shoot at him at once, and so they did, and one arrow struck
him on his nose-guard, but the other went in at the eye, and flew afterwards
through the head.&nbsp; That shot was reckoned to the king.</p>

<p>45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There fell Hugh the proud.&nbsp;
After that the British fled and had lost many men;&nbsp; but king Magnus had
won a great victory, but had yet lost many good men, and very many were wounded.&nbsp;
So this was made about it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bolts on byrnies then came rattling,</p>

<p>Might and main the monarch fought,</p>

<p>Agdir&#146;s ruler bent his crossbow,</p>

<p>Blood on helmets there was sprinkled:</p>

<p>Bowstrings&#146; hail on mail came flying,</p>

<p>Men fell fast, and Hordas&#146; king,</p>

<p>Seeking land with onslaught hard,</p>

<p>Dealt his deathblow to the earl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then king Magnus made
Anglesea his own as far south as ever the kings of Norway of old had ever owned
it.&nbsp; Anglesea is a trithing of Bretland (Wales).&nbsp; Kali Seabear&#146;s son
had got many wounds in Anglesea sound, though none of them at once
mortal.&nbsp; Afterwards king Magnus turned back by the south course along
Scotland.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Magnus had made Magnus
Erlend&#146;s son his page, and he served always at the king&#146;s board.&nbsp; But
after the battle in Anglesey-sound king Magnus took a great dislike to
him.&nbsp; He said he had behaved like a coward.&nbsp; It fell on a night when
king Magnus lay off Scotland that Magnus Erlend&#146;s son ran away from king
Magnus&#146; ship when he thought he had the best chance of flying from the
king.&nbsp; He jumped overboard and swam to land, and made up his berth so that
it seemed as if a man lay there.&nbsp; But when he came to land he ran into the
woods, and was in his under-clothing.&nbsp; He struck his foot, and hurt himself
much, as he was bare-foot, and so he could walk no longer at that time.&nbsp;
He came to a great tree, and climbed up there into the branches, and there
bound up his foot, and hid himself there in the branches for some time.&nbsp;
But in the morning when men went to meat on board the king&#146;s ship, the king
asked where Magnus Erlend&#146;s son was.&nbsp; He was told that he was asleep in
his berth.&nbsp; The king bade them wake him, and said something else than
sleep must have come over him when he lay longer than other men.&nbsp; But when
they came to his place, then he was missing.&nbsp; Then the king bade them
search for him and let loose the slot hounds.&nbsp; But when the hounds were
loose, they came at once on his track, and ran off to the wood, and came to
that tree in which Magnus was up.&nbsp; Then one hound ran round and round the
oak and bayed.&nbsp; Magnus had a stick in his hand, and threw it at the hound,
and hit him on the side.&nbsp; The hound laid his tail between his legs and ran
down to the ships, and the others after it.&nbsp; The king&#146;s men could not find
Magnus.&nbsp; He lay hid for a while in the wood, and was next heard of in the
court of Malcolm the king of Scots, and stayed there a while, but sometimes he
was in Bretland with a certain bishop.&nbsp; He was sometimes in England, or in
other places with his friends, but he did not come back to the Orkneys while
king Magnus lived.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Magnus held on his
course from the south along Scotland, and then came to meet him messengers from
Malcolm the king of Scots, and offered him peace.&nbsp; They said thus that the
king of Scots would give up to him all those isles that lie to the west of
Scotland, between which and the mainland he could sail in a ship with a fixed
rudder.&nbsp; But when king Magnus ran in from the south to Cantire, he let
them drag a cutter over the neck of Cantire, he held the tiller, and so took as
his own all Cantire.&nbsp; That is better than the best isle in the Southern
isles save Man.&nbsp; It goes from the west of Scotland, and has a narrow neck
of land at the top of it, so that there ships are very often drawn over.&nbsp;
King Magnus held on thence into the Southern isles, but sent his men into
Scotland&#146;s firths;&nbsp; they were to row in hugging the land on one side, and
out hugging it on the other, and so King Magnus claimed as his own all the
isles to the west of Scotland.&nbsp; Then the king gave it out that he would
sit that winter in the Southern isles, but gave leave to those men who he
thought had most need of it to fare home.&nbsp; But when the levies knew that,
they became home-sick, and grumbled badly about their being so long away.&nbsp;
The king then had a talk with his men and councillors.&nbsp; he went and looked
at the wounds of his men.&nbsp; Then the king went to see Kali Seabear&#146;s son
and asked after his wounds.&nbsp; Kali said they healed very little, and let him
know that he could not tell how they would turn out.&nbsp; The king asked
counsel of him.&nbsp; Kali asked:&nbsp; &#8220;Is it not so king that now your
friends steal away from you.&#8221;&nbsp; The king made as though he thought that
were not so.&nbsp; Kali bade him call them under arms, and so muster his
men.&nbsp; The king did so, and then missed many men.&nbsp; And when the king
told this to Kali, then Kali chaunted this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;How thy wary chiefs reward thee</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For those precious gifts of thine?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
West the vessel&#146;s sides are shaking,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Try our trustiness, O king!&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the king answers:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8220;Ill have I my boons bestowed,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Boons that brighten face of man,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Buoyant keel to climb the billow,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now must I command in vain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this the king kept
watch and ward if men ran from him, and let none .......... (1)&nbsp; When king
Magnus was in the Southern isles, then he got as a bride for his son Sigurd,
Bjadmunja, daughter of Moorkiartan, Thialbi&#146;s son, the Irish king of
Connaught.&nbsp; Sigurd was then nine winters old and the maiden five.&nbsp;
This winter Kali Seabear&#146;s son breathed his last of his wounds.&nbsp; In
Anglesey-sound had fallen Sigurd skewer, Kali&#146;s kinsman.&nbsp; He was liegeman
in Agdir.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next spring early king
Magnus fared away from the Southern isles.&nbsp; He fared first to the
Orkneys.&nbsp; There he heard from the east across the sea of the death of the
earls, and how Erlend had died in Nidaros, and was buried there, and Paul in
Bergen.&nbsp; In the spring in the Orkneys king Magnus gave away Gunnhilda, the
daughter of earl Erlend, to Kol Kali&#146;s son, as an atonement for the loss of his
father, and some estates in the Orkneys went with her as her dowry, and a
homestead in Paplay.&nbsp; Of Erling, the son of earl Erlend, some men say that
he had fallen in Anglesey sound, but Snorri Sturla&#146;s son says he has fallen in
Ulster with king Magnus.&nbsp; Kol Kali&#146;s son became king Magnus&#146; liegeman, and
fared east into Norway with the king, and home to Agdir with his wife, and
settled down on his farms.&nbsp; They, Kol and Gunnhilda, had two
children;&nbsp; their son&#146;s name was Kali, but their daughter&#146;s name was
Ingirid.&nbsp; they were both of the greatest promise, and reared up with much
love.</p>

<p>46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When king Magnus had ruled the land
nine winters, he fared away out of the land west across the sea and harried in
Ireland, and was the winter in Connaught.&nbsp; But the summer after he fell in
Ulster on Bartholomew&#146;s day.&nbsp; But when king Sigurd in the Orkneys heard of
his father&#146;s fall, he fared at once to Norway, and was there taken to be king
with his brothers Eystein and Olaf.&nbsp; Sigurd left behind him over the
western sea the daughter of the Irish king.&nbsp; One winter or two after the
fall of king Magnus, Hacon Paul&#146;s son came from the west across the sea, and
the kings gave him the title of earl and such power, as was due to his
birth.&nbsp; Then he fared west across the sea and took the realm under him in
the Orkneys;&nbsp; he had always followed king Magnus while he lived.&nbsp; He
was with him in his warfare east in Gothland, as is said in that lay which was
made on Hacon Paul&#146;s son.</p>

<p>47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When earl Hacon had taken the
rule in the Orkneys, Magnus earl Erlend&#146;s son came down from Scotland and asked
to take his father&#146;s heritage.&nbsp; That pleased the freemen well, for he had
very many friends.&nbsp; He had there many kinsmen and connexions who were glad
to raise him to power.&nbsp; A worthy man named Sigurd then had his mother to
wife;&nbsp; their son was Hacon churl;&nbsp; they kept house in Paplay.&nbsp;
When earl Hacon heard that earl Magnus was come into the isles, he drew force
to himself, and would not give up the Orkneys or share that realm which he had
there.&nbsp; After that friends came between them and tried to settle matters.&nbsp;
So it came about that they were made friends on those terms, that Hacon gave up
half the realm if that were the award of the kings of Norway, and with that
this strife was stayed.&nbsp; Magnus fared straightway in the spring to Norway
to find king Eystein, for Sigurd had then fared out abroad to Jerusalem.&nbsp;
King Eystein made him a hearty welcome, and gave him up his father's
inheritance, half the Orkneys and the title of earl.&nbsp; Earl Magnus fared
west over the sea to take up his power, and his kinsmen and friends and all the
people were glad at that;&nbsp; then the kinship of Hacon and Magnus throve
well when friends took part in it.&nbsp; There was then peace and plenty in the
Orkneys so long as their friendship lasted.</p>

<p>48.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saint Magnus the isle earl was the
most peerless of men, tall of growth, manly, and lively of look, virtuous in
his ways, fortunate in fight, a sage in wit, ready-tongued and lordly-minded,
lavish of money and high-spirited, quick of counsel and more beloved of his
friends than any man;&nbsp; blithe and of kind speech to wise and good men, but
hard and unsparing against robbers and sea-rovers;&nbsp; he let many men be
slain who harried the freemen and landfolk;&nbsp; he made murderers and thieves
be taken, and visited as well on the powerful as on the weak robberies and
thieveries and all ill deeds.&nbsp; He was no favourer of his friends in his
judgments, for he valued more godly justice than the distinctions of
rank.&nbsp; He was open-handed to chiefs and powerful men, but still he showed
most care for poor men.&nbsp; In all things he kept straitly God&#146;s
commandments, and kept down his body in many things which in his praiseworthy
life where bright before God, but hidden before men.&nbsp; He then showed his
purpose when he asked the hand of a maiden of the most noble race of Scotland,
and drank the bridal feast with her;&nbsp; he lived ten years with her so that
he fulfilled neither of their lusts, but was pure and spotless of all carnal
sins.&nbsp; And when he felt temptation coming over him, then he went into cold
water, and asked support of God for himself.&nbsp; Many were those other things
and noble virtues which he showed to God himself, but hid from men.</p>

<p>49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those kinsmen Magnus and Hacon held
the wardship of the land for some while, so that they were well agreed.&nbsp;
So it is said in that song which is made of them, that they fought against that
chief whose name was Duffnjal, and who was one step further off than the earl&#146;s
brother&#146;s son, (2) and he fell before them.&nbsp; Thorbjorn was the name of a
noble man whom they put to death in Burra-firth in Shetland;&nbsp; it is the
story of many men that they took the house over his head and burnt him inside
it.&nbsp; There are more tidings on which songs have been made which show that
they must have been both together, though here it is not fully told about them.&nbsp;
But when those kinsmen had ruled the land some time, then again happened, what
often and always can happen, that many ill-willing men set about spoiling their
kinship.&nbsp; Then unlucky men gathered more about Hacon, for that he was very
envious of the friendships and lordliness of his kinsman Magnus.</p>

<p>50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two men are they who are named, who
were with earl Hacon, and who were the worst of all the tale-bearers between
those kinsmen, Sigurd and Sighvat sock.&nbsp; This slander came so far with the
gossip of wicked men, that those kinsmen again gathered forces together, and
each earl fared against the other with a great company.&nbsp; Then both of them
held on to Hrossey, where the place of meeting of those Orkneyingers was.&nbsp;
But when they came there, then each drew up his men in array, and they made
them ready to battle.&nbsp; There were then the earls and all the great men,
and there too were many friends of both who did all they could to set them at
one again.&nbsp; Many then came between them with manliness and goodwill.&nbsp;
This meeting was in Lent, a little before Palm Sunday.&nbsp; But because many
men of their well-wishers took a share in clearing up these difficulties
between them, but would stand by neither to do harm to the other, then they
bound their agreement with oaths and handsels. (3)&nbsp; And when some time had
gone by after that, then earl Hacon, with falsehood and fair words, settled
with the blessed earl Magnus to meet him on a certain day;&nbsp; so that their
kinship and steadfast new-made peace should not be turned aside or set at
naught.&nbsp; This meeting for a steadfast peace and thorough atonement between
them was to be in Easter week that spring on Egil&#146;s isle.&nbsp; This pleased
earl Magnus well, being, as he was, a thoroughly whole-hearted man, far from
all doubt, guile, or greed;&nbsp; and each of them was to have two ships, and
each just as many men;&nbsp; this both swore, to hold and keep those terms of
peace which the wisest men made up their minds to declare between them.&nbsp;
But when Eastertide was gone by, each made him ready for this meeting.&nbsp;
Earl Magnus summoned to him all those men whom he knew to be kindest-hearted
and likeliest to do a good turn to both those kinsmen.&nbsp; He had two
longships and just as many men as was said.&nbsp; And when he was ready he held
on his course to Egil&#146;s isle.&nbsp; And as they were rowing in calm over the
smooth sea, there rose a billow against the ship which the earl steered and
fell on the ship just where the earl sate.&nbsp; The earl&#146;s men wondered much
at this token, that the billow fell on them in a calm where no man had ever
known it to fall before, and where the water under was deep.&nbsp; Then the
earl said:&nbsp; &#8220;It is not strange that ye wonder at this, but my thought is,
that this is a foreboding of my life&#146;s end;&nbsp; may be that may happen which
was before spaed about earl Hacon.&nbsp; We should so make up our minds about
our undertaking, that I guess my kinsman Hacon must not mean to deal fairly by
us at this meeting.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl&#146;s men were afraid at these words, when he
said he had so short hope as to his life&#146;s end, and bade him take heed for his
life, and not fare farther trusting in earl Hacon.&nbsp; Earl Magnus
answers:&nbsp; &#8220;We shall fare on still, and may all God&#146;s will be done as to
our voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end
of this sentence is illegible in the MS.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That
is, he was their second cousin.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Danish Translation adds &#8220;and the wisest men were to decide between them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it must be told about earl
Hacon, that he summoned to him a great company, and has many warships, and all
manned and trimmed as though they were to run out to battle.&nbsp; And when the
force came together, the earl makes it clear to the men that he meant at that
meeting so to settle matters between himself and earl Magnus, that they should
not both of them be over the Orkneys.&nbsp; Many of his men showed themselves
well pleased at this purpose, and added many fearful words;&nbsp; and they,
Sigurd and Sighvat sock, were among the worst in their utterance.&nbsp; Then
men began to row hard, and they fared furiously.&nbsp; Havard Gunni&#146;s son was
on board the earl&#146;s ship, a friend and counsellor of the earls&#146;, and a fast
friend to both alike.&nbsp; Hacon had hidden from him this bad counsel, which
Havard would surely not join in.&nbsp; And when he knew the earl was so
steadfast in this bad counsel, then he jumped from the earl&#146;s ship and took to
swimming, and swam to an isle where no man dwelt.&nbsp; Earl Magnus came first
to Egil&#146;s isle with his company, and when they saw Hacon coming, they knew that
treachery must be meant.&nbsp; Earl Magnus then betook himself up on the isle
with his men, and went to the church to pray, and was there that night, but his
men offered to defend him.&nbsp; The earl answers:&nbsp; &#8220;I will not lay your
life in risk for me, and if peace is not to be made between us two kinsmen, then
be it as God wills.&#8221;&nbsp; Then his men thought that what he had said when the
billow fell on them was coming true.&nbsp; Now for that he felt sure as to the
hours of his life beforehand, whether it was rather from his shrewdness or of
godly foreshadowing, then he would not fly nor fare far from the meeting of his
foes. (1)&nbsp; He prayed earnestly, and let a mass be sung to him.</p>

<p>52.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hacon and his men jumped up in the
morning and ran first to the church, and ransacked it, and did not find the
earl.&nbsp; He had gone another way on the isle with two men into a certain
hiding place.&nbsp; And when the saint earl Magnus saw that they sought for
him, then he calls out to them, and says where he was;&nbsp; he bade them look
nowhere else for him.&nbsp; And when Hacon saw him, then they ran thither with
shouts and crash of arms.&nbsp; Earl Magnus was then at his prayers when they
came to him, and when he had ended his prayers, then he signed himself (with
the cross), and said to earl Hacon, with steadfast heart:&nbsp; &#8220;Thou didst not
well, kinsman, when thou wentest back on thy oaths, and it is much to be hoped
that thou doest this more from others badness than thine own.&nbsp; Now will I
offer thee three choices, that thou doest some one of these rather than break
thy oaths and let me be slain guiltless.&#8221;&nbsp; Hacon&#146;s men asked what offer he
made.&nbsp; &#8220;That is the first, that I will go south to Rome, or out far as
Jerusalem, and visit holy places, and have two ships with me out of the land
with what we need to have, and so make atonement for both of our souls.&nbsp;
This I will swear, never to come back to the Orkneys.&#8221;&nbsp; To this they said
&#8220;Nay&#8221; at once.&nbsp; Then earl Magnus spoke:&nbsp; &#8220;Now seeing that my life is
in your power, and that I have in many things made myself an outlaw before
Almighty God, then send thou me up into Scotland to some of both our friends,
and let me be there kept in ward, and two men with me as a pastime.&nbsp; Take
thou care then that I may never be able to get out of that wardship.&#8221;&nbsp; To
this they said &#8220;Nay&#8221; at once.&nbsp; Magnus spoke:&nbsp; &#8220;One choice is still
behind, which I will offer thee, and God knows that I look more to your soul
than to my life;&nbsp; but still it better beseems thee than to take away my
life.&nbsp; Let me be maimed in my limbs as thou pleasest, or pluck out my
eyes, and set me in a dark dungeon.&#8221;&nbsp; Then earl Hacon spoke:&nbsp; &#8220;This
settlement I am ready to take, nor do I ask anything farther.&#8221;&nbsp; Then the
chiefs sprang up and said to earl Hacon:&nbsp; &#8220;We will slay now either of you
twain, and ye two shall not both from this day forth rule the lands.&#8221;&nbsp;
Then answers earl Hacon:&nbsp; &#8220;Slay ye him rather, for I will rather rule the
realm and lands than die so suddenly.&#8221;&nbsp; So says Holdbodi, a truthful
freeman from the Southern isles, of the parley they had.&nbsp; he was then with
Magnus, and another man with him, when they took him captive.</p>

<p>53.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So glad was the worthy earl Magnus
as though he were bidden to a feast;&nbsp; he neither spoke with hate nor words
of wrath.&nbsp; And after this talk he fell to prayer, and hid his face in the
palms of his hands, and shed out many tears before God&#146;s eyesight.&nbsp; When
earl Magnus the saint was done to death, Hacon bade Ofeig his banner-bearer to
slay the earl, but he said &#8220;Nay&#8221; with the greatest wrath.&nbsp; Then he forced
Lifolf his cook to kill Magnus, but he began to weep aloud.&nbsp; &#8220;Thou shalt
not weep for this,&#8221; said the earl, &#8220;for that there is fame in doing such
deeds;&nbsp; be steadfast in thy heart, for thou shalt have my clothes, as is
the wont and law of men of old (2) and thy will, and he who forces thee misdoes
more than thou.&#8221;&nbsp; But when the earl had said this, he threw off his kirtle
and gave it to Lifolf.&nbsp; After that he begged leave to say his prayers, and
that was granted him.&nbsp; He fell to earth, and gave himself over to God, and
brought himself as an offering to him.&nbsp; He not only prayed for himself or
his friends, but rather there and then for his foes and banemen, and forgave
them with all his heart what they had misdone towards him, and confessed his
own misdeeds to God, and prayed that they might be washed off him by the
outshedding of his blood, and commended his soul into God&#146;s hand, and prayed
that God&#146;s angels would come to meet his soul, and bear it into the rest of
Paradise.&nbsp; Some men say that he took the Lord&#146;s Body when the mass was
sung to him.&nbsp; When the friend of God was led out to slaughter, he spoke to
Lifolf:&nbsp; &#8220;Stand thou before me, and hew me on my head a great wound, for
it beseems not to chop off chiefs&#146; heads like thieves&#146;;&nbsp; strengthen
thyself, wretched man, for I have prayed for thee to God that he may have mercy
on thee.&#8221;&nbsp; After that he signed himself (with the cross), and bowed
himself to the stroke.&nbsp; And his spirit passed to heaven.</p>

<p>54.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That spot was before mossy and
stony.&nbsp; But in a little after the worthiness of earl Magnus before God was
so bright that there sprung up a green sward where he was slain, and God showed
that, that he was slain for righteousness&#146; sake, and inherited the fairness and
greenness of Paradise, which is called the earth of living men.&nbsp; Earl
Hacon did not allow the earl to be borne to the church.&nbsp; The death-day of
earl Magnus is two nights after Tiburce mass.&nbsp; He had then been earl over
the Orkneys seven winters, he and Hacon both together.&nbsp; There had then
passed since the fall of king Olaf seventy four winters.&nbsp; Sigurd and
Eystein and Olaf were the kings over Norway.&nbsp; There had been passed since
the birth of Christ one thousand and ninety and one winters. (3)</p>

<p>55.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the meeting, Thora, the mother
of earl Magnus, had bidden both earls to a feast, (4) and now came earl Hacon
to the feast after the slaying of earl Magnus the saint.&nbsp; Thora went about
waiting on the guests herself, and bore drink to the earl and his men, those
who had been at the slaying of her son.&nbsp; And when the drink took hold of
the earl, then Thora went before him and said:&nbsp; &#8220;Now art thou come hither
alone, lord, but I looked for you both;&nbsp; wilt thou now gladden me before
the witness of God and men;&nbsp; be now to me in a son&#146;s stead, and I will be
to thee in a mother&#146;s stead;&nbsp; I much need now thy pity, and that thou givest
me leave that my son may be borne to church;&nbsp; be now so with me in my
prayers as thou wouldest wish God to be with thee at doomsday.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl
holds his peace and thinks over the matter, and was sorry for those ill deeds
when she begged so meekly with tears that she might have her way about bearing
her son to church.&nbsp; He looked at her, and dropped tears, and said to
her:&nbsp; &#8220;Bury thy son where it pleases thee.&#8221;&nbsp; After that earl Magnus
was borne to Hrossey, and buried at that Christchurch (in Birsay) which earl
Thorfinn made them make.&nbsp; Straightway after that a heavenly light was
often seen shining over his grave.&nbsp; Afterwards men began to call upon him
often, if they were placed in danger, and their matter was granted at once as
they prayed.&nbsp; In the same way a heavenly fragrance was often perceived at
his grave, and sick men got back their health thence.&nbsp; Then next men made
journeys thither both from the Orkneys and Shetland, who were in weak health,
and watched at the tomb of earl Magnus the saint, and got healing for their
ailments.&nbsp; But yet men did not dare to spread this abroad while earl Hacon
lived.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also so said, that those men who were most in the
treachery against earl Magnus the saint, most of them died ill and harrowing
deaths.&nbsp; At that time William was bishop in the Orkneys;&nbsp; he was the
first bishop there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bishop&#146;s seat was then at Christchurch in
Birsay.&nbsp; William was bishop sixty-six years.&nbsp; He doubted long the
holiness of earl Magnus. (5)&nbsp; After the slaying of earl Magnus, Hacon took
all the realm under him in the Orkneys;&nbsp; he then made all men take an oath
to him who had before served earl Magnus;&nbsp; then he became a great chief,
and laid heavy burdens on the friends of earl Magnus, whom he thought had been
most against him in their quarrels.&nbsp; But some winters after, Hacon began
his voyage out of the land, and fared south to Rome;&nbsp; in that journey he
fared out to Jerusalem, thence he sought the halidoms, and bathed in the river
Jordan, as is palmers&#146; wont.&nbsp; After that he turned back to his own land, and
took under him the realm in the Orkneys.&nbsp; He then became a good ruler, and
kept his realm well at peace.&nbsp; Then he set up in the Orkneys new laws,
which pleased the freemen much better than those that had been before.&nbsp;
With such things his friendships began to grow;&nbsp; and so it came about that
the Orkneyingers cared for nothing else than to have Hacon for their chief, and
his offspring after him.</p>

<p>56.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, when earl Hacon had
rule in the Orkneys, that man dwelt at the Dale in Caithness whose name was
Moddan, a man of rank and very wealthy;&nbsp; his daughters were these, Helga
and Frakok and Thorleif.&nbsp; Helga, Moddan&#146;s daughter, was the concubine of
earl Hacon, and their son was Harold, who was called the smooth-tongued, but
their daughter was Ingibjorg, whom Olaf bitling (6) the Southern isle king had
to wife, and Margaret was also their daughter.&nbsp; Frakok, Moddan&#146;s daughter,
was given away to that man in Sutherland whose name was Ljot the dastard, and
their daughter was Steinvor the stout, whom Thorljot in Rackwick had to
wife.&nbsp; Their sons were Oliver the unruly and Magnus, and Orm, and Moddan
and Eindrid;&nbsp; and Audhild (was their daughter).&nbsp; Another daughter of
Frakok was Gudrun, whom Thorstein the freeman, dribblemouth, had to wife;&nbsp;
their son was Thorbjorn the clerk.&nbsp; Thorleif, Moddans&#146; daughter, had also
a daughter whose name was Gunnhilda.&nbsp; (Audhild?) Earl Hacon had also
another son, whose name was Paul, and was called hold-tongue;&nbsp; he was
gloomy, but had many friends.&nbsp; Between those brothers there was never much
love lost when they grew up.&nbsp; Earl Hacon Paul&#146;s son was smitten to death
by sickness there in the isles, and men thought that great scathe, for at the
end of his days there was good peace, but the freemen misdoubted much whether
those brothers, Paul and Harold, would be of one mind.</p>

<p>57.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the death of earl Hacon,
his sons took the rule, and they were soon of two minds, and shared the realm
into halves. &nbsp;There soon arose great divisions among the great men, and
the chieftains threw themselves very much into two sides.&nbsp; Earl Harold
held Caithness from the Scot-king, and he was almost always there, but
sometimes he was up in Scotland, for he had there many kinsmen and
friends.&nbsp; When earl Harold was seated in Sutherland, there came to him
that man whose name was Sigurd, who was said to be the son of Ethelbert the
priest;&nbsp; he was called snap-deacon;&nbsp; he came down then from Scotland,
and had been with David the Scot-king, and he had laid upon him great
honours.&nbsp; Earl Harold gave him a very hearty welcome.&nbsp; Sigurd fared
out to the Orkneys with earl Harold, and so did Frakok, Moddan&#146;s daughter, for
that Ljot the dastard, her husband was then dead.&nbsp; She and her sister
Helga had then a great share in ruling the land with earl Harold.&nbsp; Sigurd snap
was in great love with all of them.&nbsp; Then Audhild the daughter of
Thorleif, Moddan&#146;s daughter, followed him as his leman, and their daughter was
Ingigerd, whom Hacon claw afterwards had to wife.&nbsp; Eric the straight had
before had Audhild to wife;&nbsp; their son was Eric stay-brails.&nbsp; When
they, Sigurd and Frakok, came into the isles, a great sundering of followers
arose, and each of the earls gather as many of his friends about him as he
could.&nbsp; These were dearest to earl Paul, Sigurd of Westness, who had to
wife Ingibjorg the honourable, the earl&#146;s kinswoman, and Thorkel Summerled&#146;s
son, who was always with earl Paul, and was called fosterer.&nbsp; He was near
of kin to Magnus the saint, and was more beloved of his friends than any
man.&nbsp; Now the friends of earl Harold deemed that Thorkell would be the
last man to spare those brothers strife for the sake of those griefs which he
had suffered from earl Hacon their father.&nbsp; So it came about at last that
earl Harold and Sigurd snap fell on Thorkell fosterer and slew him.&nbsp; But
when earl Paul heard that, he took the tidings very ill, and gathered force
together to him.&nbsp; But then the news came at once to earl Harold, and he,
too, drew force to him.&nbsp; But when the friends of both of them were aware
of this, they came up and tried to settle matters, and then all men had a share
in setting them at one again.&nbsp; Earl Paul was so wrath that he would hear
of no terms, unless all those men were sent away who had been at the
slaying.&nbsp; But inasmuch as it seemed to the freemen that great harm would
come of their strife, then all men threw in their word that they should make
friends.&nbsp; So it came about that Sigurd was sent away out of the isles, and
those other men whom earl Paul thought were most guilty of the deed.&nbsp; Earl
Harold paid up the fines that followed on Thorkell&#146;s slaying.&nbsp; It was also
said at this peace-making that the kinship of those brothers, Paul and Harold,
should be bettered, and they were both to be together at Yule and all the other
greatest high-days.&nbsp; Sigurd snap fared away out of the Orkneys, and up
into Scotland, and dwelt there awhile with Malcolm the Scot-king in good cheer,
and he was there thought to be the doughtiest man in all manly feats.&nbsp; He
stayed for a time in Scotland ere he fared out to Jewry.</p>

<p>58.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It fell out once in the days of
those brothers, earl Harold and earl Paul, that they were to keep the Yule
feast at Orfir, in the house of earl Harold, and he was to find the fare for
both of them.&nbsp; He was busy there working hard in getting ready for the feast.&nbsp;
Those sisters were there, Frakok and Helga, the earl&#146;s mother, and they were
sitting in the little room at their sewing.&nbsp; Then earl Harold went into
the room, but those sisters sat on the cross-bench, and a new-sewn linen shirt
lay between them, white as driven snow.&nbsp; The earl took up the shirt and
saw that it was thickly stitched with gold.&nbsp; He asked:&nbsp; &#8220;Who owns
this precious thing?&#8221;&nbsp; Frakok says:&nbsp; &#8220;&#146;Tis meant for thy brother
Paul.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl says:&nbsp; &#8220;Why work ye so hard at clothes for
him?&nbsp; Ye do not take as much pains in making me clothes.&#8221;&nbsp; The earl
was just risen up from his bed, and was only in a shirt and linen breeks, and
had cast a cloak over his shoulders.&nbsp; He threw off the cloak and unfolded
the linen shirt.&nbsp; His mother caught at it, and bade him not be envious
though his brother had good clothes.&nbsp; The earl jerked it out of her hand,
and got ready to put it on.&nbsp; Then they threw off their wimples and tore
their hair, (7) &nbsp;and said, his life lay on it if he put on the shirt.&nbsp;
They both then wept sore.&nbsp; The earl put it on nevertheless, and let it
fall down over him.&nbsp; But as soon as ever the cloth clung about his body, a
shiver came over his skin, and straightway after that followed great
pain.&nbsp; And from that the earl took to his bed, and lay but a short while
ere he breathed his last.&nbsp; That his friends thought great scathe.&nbsp;
But at once after the death of earl Harold, earl Paul his brother took all the
realm under him with the consent of all the freemen in the Orkneys.&nbsp; Earl
Paul reckoned as if Frakok and her sister had meant that precious thing for him
which earl Harold had put on, and for that sake he would not have them live
there in the isles.&nbsp; Then they fared away with all their kith and kin,
first to Caithness, and thence up into Sutherland, to those homesteads which
Frakok owned there.&nbsp; There was reared up with her Erlend son of Harold the
smoothed-tongued, while he was a youngster.&nbsp; There, too, was reared up
Oliver the unruly, the son of Thorljot of Rackwick, and of Steinvor Frakok&#146;s
daughter.&nbsp; Oliver was the tallest of men, and of very great strength, and
wantonly quarrelsome, and a great manslayer;&nbsp; there too was reared up
Thorbjorn the clerk, son of Thorstein the freeman and Gudrun Frakok&#146;s
daughter.&nbsp; There, too was reared up Margaret, daughter of earl Hacon and
Helga Moddan&#146;s daughter, and Eric staybrails, Frakok&#146;s kinsman.&nbsp; These men
were all of great family and great for their own sakes, and they all thought
they had a great claim in the Orkneys to those realms which their kinsman earl
Harold had owned.&nbsp; The brothers of Frakok were Angus of the open-hand, and
earl Otter in Thurso;&nbsp; he was a man of birth and rank.</p>

<p>59.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Earl Paul ruled the Orkneys,
and had very many friends.&nbsp; He was a man of few words, and no speaker at
the Things.&nbsp; He let many other men rule the land with him.&nbsp; The earl
was courteous and kind to all the land-folk, liberal of money, and spared
nothing to his friends.&nbsp; He was not fond of war, and sate much in
quiet.&nbsp; There were then in the Orkneys many men of rank who were come from
the stock of the earls.&nbsp; There then dwelt at Westness, in Rowsay, a man of
rank, whose name was Sigurd;&nbsp; he had to wife Ingibjorg the honourable, but
her mother&#146;s name was Herbjorg, daughter of earl Paul Thorfinn&#146;s son.&nbsp; Their
sons were these, Brynjulf and Hacon pike.&nbsp; They were all chieftains of
earl Paul.&nbsp; The sons of Havard Gunni&#146;s son, were also friends of earl
Paul, Magnus, and Hacon claw, and Thorstein and Dufnjal.&nbsp; Their mother was
Bergljot, but her mother was Ragnhilda, daughter of earl Paul. (8)&nbsp; Erling
was the name of a man;&nbsp; he dwelt at Tankarnes, in Hrossey;&nbsp; he had
four sons, all of them proper men.&nbsp; Olaf was the name of a man, and he was
Hrolf&#146;s son, who dwelt in Gairsay;&nbsp; he had another house at Duncansby in
Caithness.&nbsp; Olaf was a man of the greatest strength and power, and had
great honours given him by earl Paul.&nbsp; Asleif was the name of his
wife.&nbsp; She was wise, and of great family, and was much thought of for her
own sake.&nbsp; Waltheof was the name of one of their sons, Sweyn was another,
a third Gunni;&nbsp; all these were tall and proper men.&nbsp; Their sister&#146;s
name was ingigerd.&nbsp; Sigurd earl&#146;s-father-in-law had to wife Thora, the
mother of Magnus the saint;&nbsp; their son was Hacon churl;&nbsp; that father
and son were mighty chiefs.&nbsp; In Rinansey (9) dwelt that woman whose name
was Ragna, a worthy housewife.&nbsp; Her son&#146;s name was Thorstein, a fine man
of good parts.&nbsp; Kugi was the name of a householder in Westray, a wise man
and wealthy, at Rapness.&nbsp; Helgi was the name of a householder, a man of worth
and power, who lived there in Westray, in a thorpe that was then there.&nbsp;
Thorkel flat was the name of a householder in Westray, cross-grained and high
and mighty;&nbsp; Thorstein and Haflidi were his sons;&nbsp; they had not many
friends.&nbsp; In Swanay in the Pentland firth, dwelt Grim, a man of small
means;&nbsp; his sons were these, Asbjorn and Margad, the briskest of
men.&nbsp; In the Fair Isle dwelt that man whose name was Dagfinn.&nbsp;
Thorstein was the name of a man who dwelt at Flydruness in Hrossey;&nbsp; his
sons were Asbjorn crook-eye and Blian;&nbsp; they were all unfriendly
cross-grained men.&nbsp; Jaddvor, she was the bastard daughter of earl Erlend,
born of a thrall, dwelt at Knarstead, and her son Borgar with her;&nbsp; they
were not much beloved.&nbsp; John wing dwelt in Hoy at the Upland.&nbsp;
Richard his brother dwelt at the Brink in Stronsay;&nbsp; they were grand men,
and kinsmen of Olaf Hrolf&#146;s son.&nbsp; Grimkel was the name of a man who dwelt
at Gletness.&nbsp; These were all friends of earl Paul, and all the people
along with them.&nbsp; These men all come into the story afterwards. ---
William was then bishop of the Orkneys, (10) and the bishop&#146;s seat was at
Christchurch in Birsay.&nbsp; There then were wrought ever and anon great
tokens from the holiness of earl Magnus when men watched over his tomb, but little
stir was made about it because of the rule of earl Paul.&nbsp; Bishop William
too took the edge off of what men said about the tokens of earl Magnus, and
said it was great misbelief to go about with such things.&nbsp; Now we will
first of all let the story stop awhile and rather say something of those
glorious tokens which God hath granted for the worth&#146;s sake of earl Magnus the
saint.</p>

<p>60.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bergfinn Skati&#146;s son was the name of
a householder in Shetland, and he was blind;&nbsp; he brought two cripples
south into the Orkneys;&nbsp; the name of the one was Sigurd and the
other&#146;s&nbsp; Thorbjorn;&nbsp; they all watched over the tomb of earl
Magnus.&nbsp; To all of them earl Magnus the saint appeared, and gave them
their health with God;&nbsp; and Bergfinn became so clear-sighted that he saw and
knew his right hand from his left, but both the others stood straight up.&nbsp;
But some time after, on the eve of the death day of earl Magnus, four and
twenty men in weak health watched over the tomb, and all got cured.&nbsp; Then
many men craved that of the bishop, that he would let earl Paul be spoken to,
that he would give leave that the tomb should be searched and the halidom (the
relics) of earl Magnus taken up.&nbsp; The bishop took that heavily when it was
said.&nbsp; It happened one summer that bishop William fared east to Norway,
and when he fared back he was late boun, and came to Shetland in autumn, a
little before winter set in.&nbsp; Then foul weather arose and mighty storms,
but the bishop could not bear to spend his time there, and was eager to get
home.&nbsp; After that gales burst upon them, and the winter was come.&nbsp;
Then the captain spoke to the bishop, and asked if he would vow for a fair wind
not to say anything against taking up the halidom of earl Magnus;&nbsp; the
bishop said yea to that, if the weather bettered so that he might sing mass at
home on the second Sunday at his bishop&#146;s seat.&nbsp; And as soon as ever that
vow was fast made, the weather began to change, and came round to their mind,
and they had a fair wing to the Orkneys, and such a quick one that the bishop
sung mass at home the next Sunday.&nbsp; But even when such things were granted
to him, still he would not for all that believe in the holiness of earl
Magnus.&nbsp; Earl Paul too laid his displeasure on all those men who spread
such stories about.&nbsp; This event happened in Christchurch at Birsay one day
that the bishop went into the church, and was at his prayers;&nbsp; he was all
alone in the church, but when he stood up and meant to go away, then he became
blind, and could not find his way to the doors;&nbsp; he went about a long time
seeking if he might get away.&nbsp; Then great fear fell upon him, and with
that he fared to the tomb of earl Magnus, and there prayed with tears, and
vowed that he would take up the halidom of earl Magnus, whether earl Paul liked
it well or ill.&nbsp; And after that he got back his sight there over the
tomb.&nbsp; After that the bishop sent to fetch to him all the most noble men
in the Orkneys, and made it plain to them that he was ready then to search the
tomb of earl Magnus.&nbsp; And when it was dug into, the coffin was taken out
of the ground;&nbsp; the bishop then let the bones be washed, and they were of
a right fair hue.&nbsp; He let them take a knuckle-bone and proves it thrice in
hallowed fire, and it burnt not, but rather became of a hue as though it were
gold.&nbsp; It is the story of some men that it had then run into the shape of
a cross.&nbsp; Then many tokens were there wrought at the halidom of earl
Magnus.&nbsp; Then the body was laid in a shrine and set over the altar.&nbsp;
That was on St. Lucia&#146;s day. (11)&nbsp; He had then lain in the mould
twenty-one winters.&nbsp; Then it was taken as law that each day should be kept
holy, --- the day that he was taken up and the day of his death.&nbsp; The
halidom of earl Magnus was kept there for some time. --- It happened once that
a man dreamed a dream in Westray, whose name was Gunni, a good yeoman, that
Magnus the saint came to him and said to him:&nbsp; &#8220;This shalt thou say to
bishop William, that my will is to fare away from Birsay and east to Kirkwall,
and I trow that Almighty God will grant me of his mercy that those men shall be
healed of their ailments who seek thither past hope of cure with right
faith.&nbsp; This dream shalt thou boldly tell.&#8221;&nbsp; But when Gunni awoke it
came all at once into his mind that he must not tell the dream, for that he was
afraid that earl Paul would lay his displeasure on him.&nbsp; But the next
night after earl Magnus showed himself to him when he slumbered;&nbsp; he was
then very wrath (and said):&nbsp; &#8220;Thou shalt fare to Birsay and tell thy dream
when most men are by;&nbsp; but if thou farest not, thou shalt have punishment
for it in this world and more in the other world."&#8221; Then Gunni woke and
was full of fear, and fared at once until he came to Birsay to tell his dream
before all the people at mass;&nbsp; and earl Paul was there and many other
mighty men.&nbsp; Then many begged that the bishop would set about it and bear
the halidom east to Kirkwall as the earl had revealed.&nbsp; Earl Paul held his
peace as though he had water in his mouth, and turned as red as blood.&nbsp;
After that bishop William fared east to Kirkwall with a gallant company, and
flitted thither the halidom of earl Magnus, and they set the shrine over the
high altar in the church.&nbsp; At that time the market town at Kirkwall had
few houses.&nbsp; Then many signs and tokens were straightway wrought there.
--- A little after Bergfinn Skati&#146;s son fared from the north from Shetland the
second time to watch over the halidom of earl Magnus, and had with him his
leprous son, whose name was Halfdan.&nbsp; Earl Magnus appeared to both of
them, and passed his hands over them, and then Halfdan was made thoroughly
whole;&nbsp; but Bergfinn got back his sight, so that he became a sharp-sighted
man. --- Amundi was the name of a man from the north of Shetland;&nbsp; he had
leprosy over all his body;&nbsp; he fared to Kirkwall, and watched at the
shrine of earl Magnus the saint, and prayed for help and health for
himself;&nbsp; but the holy servant of God, earl Magnus, showed himself to him
as he slumbered, and passed his hands over all his body, and when he awoke he
was whole and well, and knew no ailment anywhere, and all praised God and earl
Magnus the saint. --- Thorkel was a man&#146;s name who kept house in the
Orkneys;&nbsp; he fell down from off his barley-stack right down to the ground,
and was all crushed on one side;&nbsp; he was brought to the shrine of the
blessed earl Magnus, and there he got back his health. --- Sigurd was the name
of a man from the north out of Fetlar.&nbsp; His hand was cramped, so that all
his fingers lay in the palm;&nbsp; he fared to Kirkwall, and was there made
whole. --- Thorbjorn was the name of a man, but Gurth was the name of his
father;&nbsp; he was from Shetland, and was mad, and was brought to earl
Magnus, and became straightway whole. --- Thord was the name of a man whose
nickname was dragon-shot;&nbsp; he was Bergfinn&#146;s hireling of Shetland;&nbsp;
he thrashed corn from the halm in the barley barn the next day before St.
Lucia&#146;s and St. Magnus&#146; day.&nbsp; But when the daylight began to change, then
Bergfinn the master went out thither into the barn and bade him strike off
work.&nbsp; Thord says:&nbsp; &#8220;It doesn&#146;t often happen that thou thinkest I
work over long.&#8221;&nbsp; Bergfinn said:&nbsp; &#8220;Tomorrow is St. Magnus&#146; day, which
we ought to hold with all such honour as we best can.&#8221;&nbsp; Then Bergfinn went
away, but Thord worked still as hard as he could.&nbsp; But when a short time had
gone by then Bergfinn went a second time and spoke to Thord in mickle wrath,
and said he thought there was spite in that, "that thou workest now at
holy tides, and now leave off at once.&#8221;&nbsp; Then Bergfinn went away in a
rage.&nbsp; But Thord worked on as before.&nbsp; But when men had sat down to
the board, and had eaten and were full, Thord came in in his workaday clothes,
just when men took to drinking, and began to drink at once.&nbsp; But when he
had drained one full cup, then he lost his wits at once and got wild, so that
men had to hold him and to put him into bonds, and so it went on for three days
and nights.&nbsp; Then Bergfinn vowed for him to give half a mark of silver to
the shrine of earl Magnus, and to let Thord watch for three nights if he might
become whole.&nbsp; But Thord became whole on that night, on the evening of
which the vow had just been made.&nbsp; Two men took gold from the shrine of
earl Magnus, one an Orkney and the other a Caithness man;&nbsp; the Caithness
man was lost in the Pentland firth;&nbsp; his name was Gilli.&nbsp; The Orkney
man went mad, and said in his fits what they had done, and then a vow was made
for him to go on a pilgrimage south (to Rome), if he might be made whole at the
shrine of earl Magnus.&nbsp; Now he was brought thither and became whole at once.
&#8211;- Ogmund was the name of a Shetlander on whose head a crossbeam fell and
crushed his skull much, but Bergfinn vowed for him, and cast lots whether the
vow should be to go south on a pilgrimage, or to set a slave free, or to give
money to earl Magnus&#146; shrine if he were made whole.&nbsp; But the lot turned up
to give money for earl Magnus&#146; shrine.&nbsp; But the lot turned up to give
money for earl Magnus&#146; shrine, and there he became whole.&nbsp; But Bergfinn,
his mother&#146;s brother, gave half a mark as he had vowed.&nbsp; Sigrid Sigurd&#146;s
daughter was the name of a woman from the north out of Shetland, who was blind
from childhood and until she was twenty;&nbsp; then her father went with her to
earl Magnus, and let her watch there, and gave much goods to the shrine of
Magnus, and there she got her sight. --- Sigrid was again the name of a woman
from Shetland whose leg broke in two bits;&nbsp; she was taken to Magnus and
she got back there her health. --- Sigrid was the name of a third woman from
the north out of Shetland in the island of Unst;&nbsp; she was with Thorlak,
who kept house at Baltastead;&nbsp; (12)&nbsp; she sewed when other men left
off work on the eve of earl Magnus&#146; mass;&nbsp; but Thorlak asked why she
worked so long;&nbsp; she said she would leave off there and then.&nbsp; He
went away, but she sewed on as before.&nbsp; Then Thorlak went a second time,
and asked why she did so ill;&nbsp; &#8220;and away with thee,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and don&#146;t
work in my house.&#8221;&nbsp; She said she had only a little bit unsewn, and worked
on as before until it got dark, and she sate in her place.&nbsp; But when fires
were made, and men busked them to eating and drink, then she fell mad and was
thrown into bonds, and she was mad until Thorlak vowed a vow for her.&nbsp; He
cast lots whether the vow should be a pilgrimage south, or setting a slave
free, or giving money to the shrine of earl Magnus the saint, but the lot came
up to give money to earl Magnus&#146; shrine.&nbsp; Thorlak brought her thither, and
there she became whole, and went south afterwards.&nbsp; --- In England were
two men who staked much money on casting of dice, and one of them had already
lost a large sum.&nbsp; Then he staked a ship of burden and all that he had
against all that he had already lost.&nbsp; But the other man threw first two
sixes.&nbsp; Then that man thought things looked badly for him, and called on
earl Magnus the saint that he might not lose all that he had, and then threw
his throw.&nbsp; But one of the dice burst asunder, and there turned up two
sixes and and ace, and he gained all that lay upon the throw, and after that he
gave earl Magnus much goods. --- Groa was a woman&#146;s name in Hrossey;&nbsp; she
became raving mad, and was brought to earl Magnus the saint, and got there her
health, and was there all her life after and praised God.&nbsp; --- Sigurd was
the name of a man;&nbsp; he was Tand&#146;s son, he kept house north in Shetland, he
became devil-mad;&nbsp; and was sewn up in a hide, and was brought afterwards
from the north to Kirkwall to earl Magnus the saint, and there he got back his
health, and all praised God who were by and his holy bosom-friend earl Magnus.</p>

<p>Now is done telling here of those glorious tokens which God grants for the
sake of saint Magnus the isle-earl.&nbsp; Now also we must make an end of these
stories with this prayer, that he who wrote this Saga, and he who dictated it,
and everyone who listened to it, may have intercession and help in their
prayers from the holy knight of God earl Magnus, to the absolution of their
sins and to everlasting joy;&nbsp; but of our almighty Lord Jesus Christ may
they have help and mercy, peace and joy, both now and for ever, from him who is
and was and shall be, one true and everlasting God, granting and willing and
mighty to give all good things for ever and ever.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Danish Translation here adds &#8220;He did not go into the church for any other
reason than that he wished to preserve his life. (sic) There he made his
prayers heartily to God, and commended himself into his hands.&nbsp; Early the
morning after he went out of the church, and two others with him by another way
down to the shore into a secret place, and then said his prayers again to God.&#8221;</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Danish Translation adds, &#8220;that he shall have one&#146;s weapons and clothes who puts
him to death.&#8221;</p>

of this sentence the Translation runs thus: --- &#8220;Wise men say that in the
spring after they should have been set at one, Thora, the mother of Magnus, had
bidden them both to be her guests, and they were to come straightway to her
when they were reconciled, and came back from Egil&#146;s isle.&#8221;</p>
