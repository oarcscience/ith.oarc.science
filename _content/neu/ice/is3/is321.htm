<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --- BRIAN'S BATTLE.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(From the Saga of Thorstein Hall of the Side's Son.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thorstein fared abroad and
came to the Orkneys.&nbsp; Earl Sigurd Hl&ouml;dver's son then ruled over the
isles.&nbsp; He gave Thorstein a hearty welcome and asked him to stay with him,
and he was with the earl that winter in much esteem.&nbsp; And when the spring
came, then the earl asked Thorstein whether he would fare with him a sea
roving, or whether he would stay behind.&nbsp; Thorstein chose to fare, and was
bowman on the earl's ship, and was the ablest man in the ship, as though he had
been wont to that work.&nbsp; Thorstein was a man of good counsel and wise and
bold;&nbsp; and the earl asked him to stay long with him after he learned the
stock whence he sprang, and knew the kinship that was between them --- for
Thorey &Ouml;zur's daughter was the mother of Hall of the Side, but &Ouml;zur was the son
of Hrollaug, the son of R&ouml;gnvald of M&aelig;ren, and the father of earl Thorfinn
skullsplitter, the father of earl Hl&ouml;dver, the father of earl Sigurd. --- But
earl Sigurd harried far and wide during the summer about Scotland, and no man
challenged Thorstein's dash and daring.&nbsp; Both these things pleaded
Thorstein's cause, his kindred and his sturdiness.&nbsp; The earl slew many
savage folk, but some fled away to the woods;&nbsp; and the earl fared far and
wide about the Western lands, and burnt.&nbsp; Late in the autumn he fared home
to the Orkneys, and then had rest for three months, and then he gave his
friends good gifts.&nbsp; Then the earl spake to Thorstein and said, "Good
following hast thou shown me and like a man, and now take of me this axe inlaid
with gold;&nbsp; it beseems thee to bear it."&nbsp; Thorstein thanks the
earl, for that was the greatest treasure.&nbsp; That autumn came Burning-Flosi
to the Orkneys and his men.&nbsp; And those dealings took place between them
and earl Sigurd, as is said in Njals Saga.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
winter earl Sigurd busked him for Ireland.&nbsp; And then he fought with king
Brian, and that battle has been the most famous across the western sea, both
for the host of men (who fought) and the great tidings that happened
there.&nbsp; And when the earl busked him from home he asked Thorstein whether
he would fare too.&nbsp; Thorstein said that nothing else beseemed him than to
fare and follow him in danger, "when we think it good to lead a quiet life
of ease with you in peace."&nbsp; The earl thanked him for his
words.&nbsp; After that they fared to Ireland and fought with king Brian, and
there many tidings happened at the same time.&nbsp; As is said in his
Saga.&nbsp; There fell three banner-bearers of earl Sigurd;&nbsp; and then the
earl bade Thorstein to bear the banner.&nbsp; Then Thorstein said, "Bear
thine own crow (1) thyself, earl."&nbsp; Then a man (2) spoke and
said:&nbsp; "Thou doest right, Thorstein, for from it I have lost three of
my sons."&nbsp; The earl took the banner from the staff and hid it among
his clothing and then fought on most daringly.&nbsp; And a little after men
heard it said up aloft:&nbsp; "If earl Sigurd will have victory, then let
him make for Dumaz-hill with his men."&nbsp; That (3) ....................
ever followed the earl, and so it was then.&nbsp; There fell the earl in that
onslaught, and much folk with him.&nbsp; and just then Brodir slew king
Brian;&nbsp; but Ospak his brother took him and tore out his entrails, and led
him round and round the trunk of a tree, and so he died.&nbsp; Then great
tidings happened afterwards in loss of life.&nbsp; Thorstein and some few of
them together took their stand by the woodside.&nbsp; Then a man said,
"Why fleest thou not, Thorstein?"&nbsp; He answers, "Because I
cannot reach home this evening, even though I do fly."&nbsp; Peace was
given to Thorstein.&nbsp; And he fared back to the Orkneys and thence to
Norway&nbsp; ..................&nbsp; But when he had been three winters abroad
and had grown very famous then he fared out hither (to Iceland).&nbsp;
Thorstein was then twenty when he was in Brian's battle.</p>
