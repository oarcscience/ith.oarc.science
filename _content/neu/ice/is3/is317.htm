<p align="center">THE FOREIGN VOYAGE OF ERLING
WRY-NECK.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erling hight the son of
Kyrping-Worm and Ragnhilda the daughter of Sveinki Steinar's son.&nbsp;
Kyrping-Worm was a son of Sweyn, Sweyn's son, Erlend's son of Gerdi.&nbsp; The
mother of Worm was Ragna a daughter of earl Worm Eilif's son, and Ingibjorg the
daughter of earl Finn Arni's son.&nbsp; The mother of earl Worm was Ragnhilda a
daughter of earl Hacon the mighty.&nbsp; Erling was a wise man and a great
friend of king Ingi, and with his advice Erling got to wife Christine the
daughter of king Sigurd and queen Malmfrid.&nbsp; Erling had his home at Studla
in South Hordeland.&nbsp; Erling fared out of the land and with him Eindrid the
young and many more liegemen still;&nbsp; they had picked crews.&nbsp; They
busked them to fare to Jewry and fared west across the sea to the
Orkneys.&nbsp; The leader of that voyage was earl Rognvald-Kali and along with
him bishop William.&nbsp; And they had in all out of the Orkneys fifteen
ships.&nbsp; First they sailed to the Southern isles (sic.) and thence west to
France;&nbsp; and afterwards by that way which king Sigurd Jewry-farer had
fared out to N&ouml;rva-Sound, and they harried far and wide in heathen Spain.&nbsp;
A little after they had sailed through the Sound Eindrid the young parted from
them, and those who followed him, with six ships, and they fared to
Micklegarth.&nbsp; But earl Rognvald and Erling and their men fell on a Dromond
alone on the sea, and ran up to her with nine ships and fought against
them.&nbsp; But at last they ran their war-snakes under the Dromond;&nbsp; then
the heathen men hurled down on them weapons and stones and pots full of boiling
pitch and oil.&nbsp; Erling lay with his ship nearest in under the Dromond, and
the shower of weapons of the heathen fell beyond that ship.&nbsp; Erling and
his men hewed holes in the Dromond, some below under water, some up on the
sides, so that they got in there.&nbsp; So says Thorbjorn Wrynick-Skald in
Erling's Dirge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fearless then the
Northmen bold</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hewed with axe-edge gaps in
hold;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was daring!&nbsp;
while the wights</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sate the eagles (1) saw
strange sights,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they gazed down on each
stroke</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That fell on iron binding
oak;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the skimmer of the
seas</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felt the shock in all her
knees."</p>

<p>Audun the red was the name of that man, Erling's bowman, who first boarded
the Dromond.&nbsp; They won the Dromond, and slew there countless men;&nbsp; and
took very much goods;&nbsp; and won a splendid victory.&nbsp; Earl Rognvald and
Erling, who was afterwards called "wry-neck," came in that voyage to
Jewry-land, and out as far as the river Jordan.&nbsp; Then they turned back
from abroad across the sea, and fared to Micklegarth.&nbsp; There they left
their ships.&nbsp; They fared from abroad the landway, and held on safe and
sound till they came to Norway.&nbsp; And their voyage was very much
praised.&nbsp; Erling was thought afterwards a much greater man than before, both
for his journey and for his wedding. &nbsp;He was a sage in wit, wealthy, and
great in his kinsmen, and a good speaker;&nbsp; he leant most in all friendship
to king Ingi of all those brothers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ch. 99. (ch. 20 of king Ingi's Saga,
from the Hkr, Hulda, and Hrokkin-skinna).</p>
