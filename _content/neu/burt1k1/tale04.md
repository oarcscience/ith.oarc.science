# THE PORTER AND THE THREE LADIES OF BAGHDAD

  ONCE upon a time there was a porter in Baghdad who was a bachelor and
who would remain unmarried. It came to pass on a certain day, as he
stood about the street leaning idly upon his crate, behold, there stood
before him an honorable woman in a mantilla of Mosul silk broidered with
gold and bordered with brocade. Her walking shoes were also purred with
gold, and her hair floated in long plaits. She raised her face veil and,
showing two black eyes fringed with jetty lashes, whose glances were
soft and languishing and whose perfect beauty was ever blandishing, she
accosted the porter and said in the suavest tones and choicest language,
"Take up thy crate and follow me."

  The porter was so dazzled he could hardly believe that he heard her
aright, but he shouldered his basket in hot haste, saying in himself, "O
day of good luck! O day of Allah's grace!" and walked after her till she
stopped at the door of a house. There she rapped, and presently came out
to her an old man, a Nazarene, to whom she gave a gold piece, receiving
from him in return what she required of strained wine clear as olive
oil, and she set it safely in the hamper, saying, "Lift and follow."
Quoth the porter, "This, by Allah, is indeed an auspicious day, a day
propitious for the granting of all a man wisheth." He again hoisted up
the crate and followed her till she stopped at a fruiterer's shop and
bought from him Shami apples and Osmani quinces and Omani peaches, and
cucumbers of Nile growth, and Egyptian limes and Sultani oranges and
citrons, besides Aleppine jasmine, scented myrtle berries, Damascene
nenuphars, flower of privet and camomile, blood-red anemones, violets,
and pomegranate bloom, eglantine, and narcissus, and set the whole in
the porter's crate, saying, "Up with it."

  So he lifted and followed her till she stopped at a butcher's booth
and said, "Cut me off ten pounds of mutton." She paid him his price and
he wrapped it in a banana leaf, whereupon she laid it in the crate and
said, "Hoist, O Porter." He hoisted accordingly, and followed her as she
walked on till she stopped at a grocer's, where she bought dry fruits
and pistachio kernels, Tihamah raisins, shelled almonds, and all wanted
for dessert, and said to the porter, "Lift and follow me." So he up with
his hamper and after her till she stayed at the confectioner's, and she
bought an earthen platter, and piled it with all kinds of sweetmeats in
his shop, open-worked tarts and fritters scented with musk, and "soap
cakes," and lemon loaves, and melon preserves, and "Zaynab's combs," and
"ladies' fingers," and "Kazi's titbits," and goodies of every
description, and placed the platter in the porter's crate. Thereupon
quoth he (being a merry man), "Thou shouldest have told me, and I would
have brought with me a pony or a she-camel to carry all this market
stuff." She smiled and gave him a little cuff on the nape, saying, "Step
out and exceed not in words, for (Allah willing!) thy wage will not be
wanting."

  Then she stopped at a perfumer's and took from him ten sorts of
waters, rose scented with musk, orange-flower, water-lily,
willow-flower, violet and five others. And she also bought two loaves of
sugar, a bottle for perfume-spraying, a lump of male incense, aloe wood,
ambergris, and musk, with candles of Alexandria wax, and she put the
whole into the basket, saying, "Up with thy crate and after me." He did
so and followed until she stood before the greengrocer's, of whom she
bought pickled sallower and olives, in brine and in oil, with tarragon
and cream cheese and hard Syrian cheese, and she stowed them away in the
crate, saying to the porter, "Take up thy basket and follow me." He did
so and went after her till she came to a fair mansion fronted by a
spacious court, a tall, fine place to which columns gave strength and
grace. And the gate thereof had two leaves of ebony inlaid with plates
of red gold. The lady stopped at the door and, turning her face veil
sideways, knocked softly with her knuckles whilst the porter stood
behind her, thinking of naught save her beauty and loveliness.

  Presently the door swung back and both leaves were opened, whereupon
he looked to see who had opened it, and behold, it was a lady of tall
figure, some five feet high, a model of beauty and loveliness,
brilliance and symmetry and perfect grace. Her forehead was
flower-white, her cheeks like the anemone ruddy-bright. Her eyes were
those of the wild heifer or the gazelle, with eyebrows like the crescent
moon which ends Sha'aban and begins Ramazan. Her mouth was the ring of
Solomon, her lips coral-red, and her teeth like a line of strung pearls
or of camomile petals. Her throat recalled the antelope's, and her
breasts, like two pomegranates of even size, stood at bay as it were.
Her body rose and fell in waves below her dress like the rolls of a
piece of brocade, and her navel would hold an ounce of benzoin ointment.
In fine, she was like her of whom the poet said:

     On Sun and Moon of palace cast thy sight,  
     Enjoy her flowerlike face, her fragrant light.  
     Thine eyes shall never see in hair so black  
     Beauty encase a brow so purely white.  
     The ruddy rosy cheek proclaims her claim,  
     Though fail her name whose beauties we indite.  
     As sways her gait, I smile at hips so big  
     And weep to see the waist they bear so slight.  

  When the porter looked upon her, his wits were waylaid and his senses
were stormed so that his crate went nigh to fall from his head, and he
said to himself, "Never have I in my life seen a day more blessed than
this day!" Then quoth the lady portress to the lady cateress, "Come in
from the gate and relieve this poor man of his load." So the provisioner
went in, followed by the portress and the porter, and went on till they
reached a spacious ground-floor hall, built with admirable skill and
beautified with all manner colors and carvings, with upper balconies and
groined arches and galleries and cupboards and recesses whose curtains
hung before them. In the midst stood a great basin full of water
surrounding a fine fountain, and at the upper end on the raised dais was
a couch of juniper wood set with gems and pearls, with a canopy like
mosquito curtains of red satin-silk looped up with pearls as big as
filberts and bigger.

  Thereupon sat a lady bright of blee, with brow beaming brilliancy, the
dream of philosophy, whose eyes were fraught with Babel's gramarye and
her eyebrows were arched as for archery. Her breath breathed ambergris
and perfumery and her lips were sugar to taste and carnelian to see. Her
stature was straight as the letter l and her face shamed the noon sun's
radiancy; and she was even as a galaxy, or a dome with golden marquetry,
or a bride displayed in choicest finery, or a noble maid of Araby. The
third lady, rising from the couch, stepped forward with graceful swaying
gait till she reached the middle of the saloon, when she said to her
sisters: "Why stand ye here? Take it down from this poor man's head!"
Then the cateress went and stood before him and the portress behind him
while the third helped them, and they lifted the load from the porter's
head, and, emptying it of all that was therein, set everything in its
place. Lastly they gave him two gold pieces, saying, "Wend thy ways, O
Porter."

  But he went not, for he stood looking at the ladies and admiring what
uncommon beauty was theirs, and their pleasant manners and kindly
dispositions (never had he seen goodlier). And he gazed wistfully at
that good store of wines and sweet-scented flowers and fruits and other
matters. Also he marveled with exceeding marvel, especially to see no
man in the place, and delayed his going, whereupon quoth the eldest
lady: "What aileth thee that goest not? Haply thy wage be too little?"
And, turning to her sister, the cateress, she said, "Give him another
dinar!" But the porter answered: "By Allah, my lady, it is not for the
wage, my hire is never more than two dirhams, but in very sooth my heart
and my soul are taken up with you and your condition. I wonder to see
you single with ne'er a man about you and not a soul to bear you
company. And well you wot that the minaret toppleth o'er unless it stand
upon four, and you want this same fourth, and women's pleasure without
man is short of measure, even as the poet said:

     "Seest not we want for joy four things all told-  
     The harp and lute, the flute and flageolet-  
     And be they companied with scents fourfold,  
     Rose, myrtle, anemone, and violet.  
     Nor please all eight an four thou wouldst withhold-  
     Good wine and youth and gold and pretty pet.  

  "You be three and want a fourth who shall be a person of good sense
and prudence, smart-witted, and one apt to keep careful counsel." His
words pleased and amused them much, and they laughed at him and said:
"And who is to assure us of that? We are maidens, and we fear to entrust
our secret where it may not be kept, for we have read in a certain
chronicle the lines of one Ibn al-Sumam:

     "Hold fast thy secret and to none unfold,  
     Lost is a secret when that secret's told.  
     An fail thy breast thy secret to conceal,  
     How canst thou hope another's breast shall hold?"  

When the porter heard their words, he rejoined: "By your lives! I am a
man of sense and a discreet, who hath read books and perused chronicles.
I reveal the fair and conceal the foul and I act as the poet adviseth:

       "None but the good a secret keep,  
       And good men keep it unrevealed.  
       It is to me a well-shut house  
       With keyless locks and door ensealed."  

  When the maidens heard his verse and its poetical application
addressed to them, they said: "Thou knowest that we have laid out all
our moneys on this place. Now say, hast thou aught to offer us in return
for entertainment? For surely we will not suffer thee to sit in our
company and be our cup companion, and gaze upon our faces so fair and so
rare, without paying a round sum. Wettest thou not the saying:

            "Sans hope of gain  
            Love's not worth a grain"?  

Whereto the lady portress added, "If thou bring anything, thou art a
something; if no thing, be off with thee, thou art a nothing." But the
procuratrix interposed, saying: "Nay, O my sisters, leave teasing him,
for by Allah he hath not failed us this day, and had he been other he
never had kept patience with me, so whatever be his shot and scot I will
take it upon myself."

  The porter, overjoyed, kissed the ground before her and thanked her,
saying, "By Allah, these moneys are the first fruits this day hath given
me." Hearing this, they said, "Sit thee down and welcome to thee," and
the eldest lady added: "By Allah, we may not suffer thee to join us save
on one condition, and this it is, that no questions be asked as to what
concerneth thee not, and frowardness shall be soundly flogged." Answered
the porter: "I agree to this, O my lady. On my head and my eyes be it!
Look ye, I am dumb, I have no tongue." Then arose the provisioneress
and, tightening her girdle, set the table by the fountain and put the
flowers and sweet herbs in their jars, and strained the wine and ranged
the flasks in rows and made ready every requisite. Then sat she down,
she and her sisters, placing amidst them the porter, who kept deeming
himself in a dream. And she took up the wine flagon and poured out the
first cup and drank it off, and likewise a second and a third. After
this she filled a fourth cup, which she handed to one of her sisters,
and lastly, she crowned a goblet and passed it to the porter, saying:

     "Drink the dear draught, drink free and fain  
     What healeth every grief and pain."  

  He took the cup in his hand and, Touting low, returned his best thanks
and improvised:

     "Drain not the bowl save with a trusty friend,  
     A man of worth whose good old blood all know.  
     For wine, like wind, sucks sweetness from the sweet  
     And stinks when over stench it haply blow."  

Adding:

     "Drain not the bowl, save from dear hand like thine,  
     The cup recalls thy gifts, thou, gifts of wine."  

After repeating this couplet he kissed their hands and drank and was
drunk and sat swaying from side to side and pursued:

     "All drinks wherein is blood the Law unclean  
     Doth hold save one, the bloodshed of the vine.  
     Fill! Fill! Take all my wealth bequeathed or won,  
     Thou fawn! a willing ransome for those eyne."  

  Then the cateress crowned a cup and gave it to the portress, who took
it from her hand and thanked her and drank. Thereupon she poured again
and passed to the eldest lady, who sat on the couch, and filled yet
another and handed it to the porter. He kissed the ground before them,
and after drinking and thanking them, he again began to recite:

          "Here! Here! By Allah, here!  
          Cups of the sweet, the dear!  
          Fill me a brimming bowl,  
          The Fount o' Life I speer."  

Then the porter stood up before the mistress of the house and said, "O
lady, I am thy slave, thy Mameluke, thy white thrall, thy very
bondsman," and he began reciting:

     "A slave of slaves there standeth at thy door,  
     Lauding thy generous boons and gifts galore.  
     Beauty! May he come in awhile to 'joy  
     Thy charms? For Love and I part nevermore!"  

  Then the lady took the cup and drank it off to her sisters' health,
and they ceased not drinking (the porter being in the midst of them) and
dancing and laughing and reciting verses and singing ballads and
ritornellos. All this time the porter was carrying on with them,
kissing, toying, biting, handling, groping, fingering whilst one thrust
a dainty morsel in his mouth and another slapped him, and this cuffed
his cheeks, and that threw sweet flowers at him. And he was in the very
paradise of pleasure, as though he were sitting in the seventh sphere
among the houris of Heaven. And they ceased not to be after this fashion
till night began to fall. Thereupon said they to the porter, "Bismillah,
O our master, up and on with those sorry old shoes of thine and turn thy
face and show us the breadth of thy shoulders!" Said he: "By Allah, to
part with my soul would be easier for me than departing from you. Come,
let us join night to day, and tomorrow morning we will each wend our own
way." "My life on you," said the procuratrix, "suffer him to tarry with
us, that we may laugh at him. We may live out our lives and never meet
with his like, for surely he is a right merry rogue and a witty." So
they said: "Thou must not remain with us this night save on condition
that thou submit to our commands, and that whatso thou seest, thou ask
no questions thereanent, nor inquire of its cause." "All right,"
rejoined he, and they said, "Go read the writing over the door."

  So he rose and went to the entrance and there found written in letters
of gold wash: WHOSO SPEAKETH OF WHAT CONCERNETH HIM NOT SHALL HEAR WHAT
PLEASETH HIM NOT! The porter said, "Be ye witnesses against me that I
will not speak on whatso concerneth me not." Then the cateress arose and
set food before them and they ate. After which they changed their
drinking place for another, and she lighted the lamps and candles and
burned ambergris and aloe wood, and set on fresh fruit and the wine
service, when they fell to carousing and talking of their lovers. And
they ceased not to eat and drink and chat, nibbling dry fruits and
laughing and playing tricks for the space of a full hour, when lo! a
knock was heard at the gate.

  The knocking in no wise disturbed the seance, but one of them rose and
went to see what it was and presently returned, saying, "Truly our
pleasure for this night is to be perfect." "How is that?" asked they,
and she answered: "At the gate be three Persian Kalandars with their
beards and heads and eyebrows shaven, and all three blind of the left
eye- which is surely a strange chance. They are foreigners from Roumland
with the mark of travel plain upon them. They have just entered Baghdad,
this being their first visit to our city, and the cause of their
knocking at our door is simply because they cannot find a lodging.
Indeed one of them said to me: 'Haply the owner of this mansion will let
us have the key of his stable or some old outhouse wherein we may pass
this night.' For evening had surprised them and, being strangers in the
land, they knew none who would give them shelter. And, O my sisters,
each of them is a figure o' fun after his own fashion, and if we let
them in we shall have matter to make sport of." She gave not over
persuading them till they said to her: "Let them in, and make thou the
usual condition with them that they speak not of what concerneth them
not, lest they hear what pleased them not."

  So she rejoiced and, going to the door, presently returned with the
three monoculars whose beards and mustachios were clean-shaven. They
salaamed and stood afar off by way of respect, but the three ladies rose
up to them and welcomed them and wished them joy of their safe arrival
and made them sit down. The Kalandars looked at the room and saw that it
was a pleasant place, clean-swept and garnished with flowers, and the
lamps were burning and the smoke of perfumes was spiring in air, and
beside the dessert and fruits and wine, there were three fair girls who
might be maidens. So they exclaimed with one voice, "By Allah, 'tis
good!" Then they turned to the porter and saw that he was a merry-faced
wight, albeit he was by no means sober and was sore after his slappings.
So they thought that he was one of themselves and said, "A mendicant
like us, whether Arab or foreigner!"

  But when the porter heard these words, he rose up and, fixing his eyes
fiercely upon them, said: "Sit ye here without exceeding in talk! Have
you not read what is writ over the door? Surely it befitteth not fellows
who come to us like paupers to wag your tongues at us." "We crave thy
pardon, O Fakir," rejoined they, "and our heads are between thy hands."
The ladies laughed consumedly at the squabble and, making peace between
the Kalandars and the porter, seated the new guests before meat, and
they ate. Then they sat together, and the portress served them with
drink, and as the cup went round merrily, quoth the porter to the
askers, "And you, O brothers mine, have ye no story or rare adventure to
amuse us withal?"

  Now the warmth of wine having mounted to their heads, they called for
musical instruments, and the portress brought them a tambourine of
Mosul, and a lute of Irak, and a Persian harp. And each mendicant took
one and tuned it, this the tambourine and those the lute and the harp,
and struck up a merry tune while the ladies sang so lustily that there
was a great noise. And whilst they were carrying on, behold, someone
knocked at the gate, and the portress went to see what was the matter
there.

  Now the cause of that knocking, O King (quoth Scheherazade) was this,
the Caliph Harun al-Rashid had gone forth from the palace, as was his
wont now and then, to solace himself in the city that night, and to see
and hear what new thing was stirring. He was in merchant's gear, and he
was attended by Ja'afar, his Wazir, and by Masrur, his Sworder of
Vengeance. As they walked about the city, their way led them toward the
house of the three ladies, where they heard the loud noise of musical
instruments and singing and merriment. So quoth the Caliph to Ja'afar,
"I long to enter this house and hear those songs and see who sing them."
Quoth Ja'afar, "O Prince of the Faithful, these folk are surely drunken
with wine, and I fear some mischief betide us if we get amongst them."
"There is no help but that I go in there," replied the Caliph, "and I
desire thee to contrive some pretext for our appearing among them."
Ja'afar replied, "I hear and I obey," and knocked at the door, whereupon
the portress came out and opened. Then Ja'afar came forward and, kissing
the ground before her, said, "O my lady, we be merchants from Tiberias
town. We arrived at Baghdad ten days ago and, alighting at the
merchants' caravanserai, we sold all our merchandise. Now a certain
trader invited us to an entertainment this night, so we went to his
house and he set food before us and we ate. Then we sat at wine and
wassail with him for an hour or so when he gave us leave to depart. And
we went out from him in the shadow of the night and, being strangers, we
could not find our way back to our khan. So haply of your kindness and
courtesy you will suffer us to tarry with you this night, and Heaven
will reward you!"

  The portress looked upon them and, seeing them dressed like merchants
and men of gave looks and solid, she returned to her sisters and
repeated to them Ja'afar's story, and they took compassion upon the
strangers and said to her, "Let them enter." She opened the door to
them, when said they to her, "Have we thy leave to come in?" "Come in,"
quoth she, and the Caliph entered, followed by Ja'afar and Masrur. And
when the girls saw them they stood up to them in respect and made them
sit down and looked to their wants, saying, "Welcome, and well come and
good cheer to the guests, but with one condition!" "What is that?" asked
they, and one of the ladies answered, "Speak not of what concerneth you
not, lest ye hear what pleaseth you not." "Even so," said they, and sat
down to their wine and drank deep.

  Presently the Caliph looked on the three Kalandars and, seeing them,
each and every blind of the left eye, wondered at the sight. Then he
gazed upon the girls, and he was startled and he marveled with exceeding
marvel at their beauty and loveliness. They continued to carouse and to
converse, and said to the Caliph, "Drink!" But he replied, "I am vowed
to pilgrimage," and drew back from the wine. Thereupon the portress rose
and, spreading before him a tablecloth worked with gold, set thereon a
porcelain bowl into which she poured willow-flower water with a lump of
snow and a spoonful of sugar candy. The Caliph thanked her and said in
himself, "By Allah, I will recompense her tomorrow for the kind deed she
hath done." The others again addressed themselves to conversing and
carousing, and when the wine gat the better of them, the eldest lady,
who ruled the house, rose and, making obeisance to them, took the
cateress by the hand and said, "Rise, O my sister, and let us do what is
our devoir." Both answered "Even so!"

  Then the portress stood up and proceeded to remove the table service
and the remnants of the banquet, and renewed the pastilies and cleared
the middle of the saloon. Then she made the Kalandars sit upon a sofa at
the side of the estrade, and seated the Caliph and Ja'afar and Masrur on
the other side of the saloon, after which she called the porter, and
said: "How scant is thy courtesy! Now thou art no stranger- nay, thou
art one of the household." So he stood up and, tightening his
waistcloth, asked, "What would ye I do?" And she answered, "Stand in thy
place." Then the procuratrix rose and set in the midst of the saloon a
low chair and, opening a closet, cried to the porter, "Come help me."

  So he went to help her and saw two black bitches with chains round
their necks, and she said to him, "Take hold of them," and he took them
and led them into the middle of the saloon. Then the lady of the house
arose and tucked up her sleeves above her wrists and, seizing a scourge,
said to the porter, "Bring forward one of the bitches." He brought her
forward, dragging her by the chain, while the bitch wept and shook her
head at the lady, who, however, came down upon her with blows on the
sconce. And the bitch howled and the lady ceased not beating her till
her forearm failed her. Then, casting the scourge from her hand, she
pressed the bitch to her bosom and, wiping away her tears with her
hands, kissed her head. Then said she to the porter, "Take her away and
bring the second." And when he brought her, she did with her as she had
done with the first.

  Now the heart of the Caliph was touched at these cruel doings. His
chest straitened and he lost all patience in his desire to know why the
two bitches were so beaten. He threw a wink at Ja'afar, wishing him to
ask, but the Minister, turning toward him, said by signs, "Be silent!"
Then quoth the portress to the mistress of the house, "O my lady, arise
and go to thy place, that I in turn may do my devoir." She answered,
"Even so," and, taking her seat upon the couch of juniper wood,
pargetted with gold and silver, said to the portress and cateress, "Now
do ye what ye have to do." Thereupon the portress sat upon a low seat by
the couch side, but the procuratrix, entering a closet, brought out of
it a bag of satin with green fringes and two tassels of gold. She stood
up before the lady of the house and, shaking the bag, drew out from it a
lute which she tuned by tightening its pegs; and when it was in perfect
order, she began to sing these quatrains:

           "Ye are the wish, the aim of me,  
           And when, O love, thy sight I see,  
           The heavenly mansion openeth,  
           But Hell I see when lost thy sight.  
           From thee comes madness, nor the less  
           Comes highest joy, comes ecstasy.  
           Nor in my love for thee I fear  
           Or shame and blame, or hate and spite.  
           When Love was throned within my heart  
           I rent the veil of modesty,  
           And stints not Love to rend that veil,  
           Garring disgrace on grace to alight.  
           The robe of sickness then I donned,  
           But rent to rags was secrecy.  
           Wherefore my love and longing heart  
           Proclaim your high supremest might.  
           The teardrop railing adown my cheek  
           Telleth my tale of ignomy.  
           And all the hid was seen by all  
           And all my riddle ree'd aright.  
           Heal then my malady, for thou  
           Art malady and remedy!  
           But she whose cure is in thy hand  
           Shall ne'er be free of bane and blight.  
           Burn me those eyne that radiance rain,  
           Slay me the swords of phantasy.  
           How many hath the sword of Love  
           Laid low, their high degree despite?  
           Yet will I never cease to pine,  
           Nor to oblivion will I flee.  
           Love is my health, my faith, my joy,  
           Public and private, wrong or right.  
           O happy eyes that sight thy charms,  
           That gaze upon thee at their gree!  
           Yea, of my purest wish and will  
           The slave of Love I'll aye be hight."  

  When the damsel heard this elegy in quatrains, she cried out "Alas!
Alas!" and rent her raiment, and fell to the ground fainting. And the
Caliph saw scars of the palm rod on her back and welts of the whip, and
marveled with exceeding wonder. Then the portress arose and sprinkled
water on her and brought her a fresh and very fine dress and put it on
her. But when the company beheld these doings, their minds were
troubled, for they had no inkling of the case nor knew the story
thereof. So the Caliph said to Ja'afar: "Didst thou not see the scars
upon the damsel's body? I cannot keep silence or be at rest till I learn
the truth of her condition and the story of this other maiden and the
secret of the two black bitches." But Ja'afar answered: "O our lord,
they made it a condition with us that we speak not of what concerneth us
not, lest we come to hear what pleaseth us not."

  Then said the portress, "By Allah, O my sister, come to me and
complete this service for me." Replied the procuratrix, "With joy and
goodly gree." So she took the lute and leaned it against her breasts and
swept the strings with her finger tips, and began singing:

     "Give back mine eyes their sleep long ravished,  
     And say me whither be my reason fled.  
     I learnt that lending to thy love a place,  
     Sleep to mine eyelids mortal foe was made.  
     They said, \`We held thee righteous. Who waylaid  
     Thy soul?' 'Go ask his glorious eyes,' I said.  
     I pardon all my blood he pleased to shed.  
     Owning his troubles drove him blood to shed.  
     On my mind's mirror sunlike sheen he cast,  
     Whose keen reflection fire in vitals bred.  
     Waters of Life let Allah waste at will,  
     Suffice my wage those lips of dewy red.  
     And thou address my love thou'lt find a cause  
     For plaint and tears or ruth or lustilied.  
     In water pure his form shall greet your eyne,  
     When fails the bowl nor need ye drink of wine."  

Then she quoted from the same ode:

     "I drank, but the draught of his glance, not wine,  
     And his swaying gait swayed to sleep these eyne.  
     'Twas not grape juice gript me but grasp of Past,  
     'Twas not bowl o'erbowled me but gifts divine.  
     His coiling curllets my soul ennetted  
     And his cruel will all my wits outwitted."  

After a pause she resumed:

     "If we 'plain of absence, what shall we say?  
     Or if pain afflict us, where wend our way?  
     An I hire a truchman to tell my tale,  
     The lovers' plaint is not told for pay.  
     If I put on patience, a lover's life  
     After loss of love will not last a day.  
     Naught is left me now but regret, repine,  
     And tears flooding cheeks forever and aye.  
     O thou who the babes of these eyes hast fled,  
     Thou art homed in heart that shall never stray.  
     Would Heaven I wot hast thou kept our pact  
     Long as stream shall flow, to have firmest fay?  
     Or hast forgotten the weeping slave,  
     Whom groans afflict and whom griefs waylay?  
     Ah, when severance ends and we side by side  
     Couch, I'll blame thy rigors and chide thy pride!"  

  Now when the portress heard her second ode, she shrieked aloud and
said: "By Allah! 'Tis right good!" and, laying hands on her garments,
tore them as she did the first time, and fell to the ground fainting.
Thereupon the procuratrix rose and brought her a second change of
clothes after she had sprinkled water on her. She recovered and sat
upright and said to her sister the cateress, "Onward, and help me in my
duty, for there remains but this one song." So the provisioneress again
brought out the lute and began to sing these verses:

     "How long shall last, how long this rigor rife of woe  
     May not suffice thee all these tears thou seest flow?  
     Our parting thus with purpose fell thou dost prolong  
     Is't not enough to glad the heart of envious foe?  
     Were but this lying world once true to lover heart,  
     He had not watched the weary night in tears of woe.  
     Oh, pity me whom overwhelmed thy cruel will,  
     My lord, my king, 'tis time some ruth to me thou show.  
     To whom reveal my wrongs, O thou who murdered me?  
     Sad, who of broken troth the pangs must undergo!  
     Increase wild love for thee and frenzy hour by hour,  
     And days of exile minute by so long, so slow.  
     O Moslems, claim vendetta for this slave of Love,  
     Whose sleep Love ever wastes, whose patience Love lays low.  
     Doth law of Love allow thee, O my wish! to lie  
     Lapt in another's arms and unto me cry 'Go!'?  
     Yet in thy presence, say, what joys shall I enjoy  
     When he I love but works my love to overthrow?"  

  When the portress heard the third song, she cried aloud and, laying
hands on her garments, rent them down to the very skirt and fell to the
ground fainting a third time, again showing the scars of the scourge.
Then said the three Kalandars, "Would Heaven we had never entered this
house, but had rather nighted on the mounds and heaps outside the city!
For verily our visit hath been troubled by sights which cut to the
heart." The Caliph turned to them and asked, "Why so?" and they made
answer, "Our minds are sore troubled by this matter." Quoth the Caliph,
"Are ye not of the household?" and quoth they, "No, nor indeed did we
ever set eyes on the place till within this hour." Hereat the Caliph
marveled and rejoined, "This man who sitteth by you, would he not know
the secret of the matter?" And so saying he winked and made signs at the
porter. So they questioned the man, but he replied: "By the All-might of
Allah, in love all are alike! I am the growth of Baghdad, yet never in
my born days did I darken these doors till today, and my companying with
them was a curious matter." "By Allah," they rejoined, "we took thee for
one of them and now we see thou art one like ourselves."

  Then said the Caliph: "We be seven men, and they only three women
without even a fourth to help them, so let us question them of their
case. And if they answer us not, fain we will be answered by force." All
of them agreed to this except Ja'afar, who said, "This is not my
recking. Let them be, for we are their guests and, as ye know, they made
a compact and condition with us which we accepted and promised to keep.
Wherefore it is better that we be silent concerning this matter, and as
but little of the night remaineth, let each and every of us gang his own
gait." Then he winked at the Caliph and whispered to him, "There is but
one hour of darkness left and I can bring them before thee tomorrow,
when thou canst freely question them all concerning their story." But
the Caliph raised his head haughtily and cried out at him in wrath,
saying: "I have no patience left for my longing to hear of them. Let the
Kalandars question them forthright." Quoth Ja'afar, "This is not my
rede."

  Then words ran high and talk answered talk, and they disputed as to
who should first put the question, but at last all fixed upon the
porter. And as the jangle increased the house mistress could not but
notice it and asked them, "O ye folk! On what matter are ye talking so
loudly?" Then the porter stood up respectfully before her and said: "O
my lady, this company earnestly desire that thou acquaint them with
story of the two bitches and what maketh thee punish them so cruelly,
and then thou fallest to weeping over them and kissing them. And lastly,
they want to hear the tale of thy sister and why she hath been
bastinadoed with palm sticks like a man. These are the questions they
charge me to put, and peace be with thee." Thereupon quoth she who was
the lady of the house to the guests, "Is this true that he saith on your
part?" and all replied, "Yes!" save Ja'afar, who kept silence.

  When she heard these words she cried: "By Allah, ye have wronged us, O
our guests, with grievous wronging, for when you came before us we made
compact and condition with you that whoso should speak of what
concerneth him not should hear what pleaseth him not. Sufficeth ye not
that we took you into our house and fed you with our best food? But the
fault is not so much yours as hers who let you in." Then she tucked up
her sleeves from her wrists and struck the floor thrice with her hand,
crying, "Come ye quickly!" And lo! a closet door opened and out of it
came seven Negro slaves with drawn swords in hand, to whom she said,
"Pinion me those praters' elbows and bind them each to each." They did
her bidding and asked her: "O veiled and virtuous! Is it thy high
command that we strike off their heads?" But she answered, "Leave them
awhile that I question them of their condition before their necks feel
the sword." "By Allah, O my lady!" cried the porter, "slay me not for
other's sin. All these men offended and deserve the penalty of crime
save myself. Now, by Allah, our night had been charming had we escaped
the mortification of those monocular Kalandars whose entrance into a
populous city would convert it into a howling wilderness." Then he
repeated these verses:

     "How fair is ruth the strong man deigns not smother!  
     And fairest fair when shown to weakest brother.  
     By Love's own holy tie between us twain,  
     Let one not suffer for the sin of other."  

  When the porter ended his verse, the lady laughed despite her wrath,
and came up to the party and spake thus: "Tell me who ye be, for ye have
but an hour of life. And were ye not men of rank and perhaps notables of
your tribes, you had not been so froward and I had hastened your doom."
Then said the Caliph: "Woe to thee, O Ja'afar, tell her who we are lest
we be slain by mistake, and speak her fair before some horror befall
us." "'Tis part of thy deserts," replied he, whereupon the Caliph cried
out at him, saying, "There is a time for witty words and there is a time
for serious work." Then the lady accosted the three Kalandars and asked
them, "Are ye brothers?" when they answered, "No, by Allah, we be naught
but fakirs and foreigners." Then quoth she to one among them, "Wast thus
born blind of one eye?" and quoth he, "No, by Allah, 'twas a marvelous
matter and a wondrous mischance which caused my eye to be torn out, and
mine is a tale which, if it were written upon the eye corners with
needle gravers, were a warner to whoso would be warned." She questioned
the second and third Kalandar, but all replied like the first, "By
Allah, O our mistress, each one of us cometh from a different country,
and we are all three the sons of kings, sovereign princes ruling over
suzerains and capital cities."

  Thereupon she turned toward them and said: "Let each and every of you
tell me his tale in due order and explain the cause of his coming to our
place, and if his story please us, let him stroke his head and wend his
way." The first to come forward was the hammal, the porter, who said: "O
my lady, I am a man and a porter. This dame, the cateress, hired me to
carry a load and took me first to the shop of a vintner, then to the
booth of a butcher, thence to the stall of a fruiterer, thence to a
grocer who also sold dry fruits, thence to a confectioner and a
perfumer-cum-druggist, and from him to this place, where there happened
to me with you what happened. Such is my story, and peace be on us all!"
At this the lady laughed and said, "Rub thy head and wend thy ways!" But
he cried, "By Allah, I will not stump it till I hear the stories of my
companions!" Then came forward one of the monoculars and began to tell
her
