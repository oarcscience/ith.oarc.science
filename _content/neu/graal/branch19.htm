<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XIX</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
Now is the story silent of Perceval and cometh back to King
Arthur, the very matter thereof, like as testifieth the history,
that in no place is corrupted and the Latin lie not.  King Arthur
was at Cardoil on one day of Whitsuntide that was right fair and
clear, and many knights were in the hall.  The King sate at meat
and all the knights about him.  The King looketh at the windows
of the hall to right and left, and seeth that two sunbeams are
shining within that fill the whole hall with light.  Thereof he
marvelleth much and sendeth without the hall to see what it might
be.  The messenger cometh back again and saith thereof that two
suns appear to be shining, the one in the East and the other in
the West.  He marvelleth much thereat, and prayeth Our Lord that
he may be permitted to know wherefore two suns should appear in
such wise.  A Voice appeared at one of the windows that said to
him: "King, marvel not hereof that two suns should appear in the
sky, for our Lord God hath well the power, and know well that
this is for joy of the conquest that the Good Knight hath made
that took away the shield from herewithin.  He hath won the land
that belonged to good King Fisherman from the evil King of Castle
Mortal, that did away thence the good believe, and therefore was
it that the Graal was hidden.  Now God so willeth that you go
thither, I and that you choose out the best knights of your
court, for better pilgrimage may you never make, and what time
you shall return hither, your faith shall be doubled and the
people of Great Britain shall be better disposed and better
taught to maintain the service of the Saviour."
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
Thereupon the Voice departed and well pleased was the King of
that it had said.  He sitteth at meat beside the Queen. 
Straightway behold you, a damsel that cometh of such beauty as
never was greater, and clad right richly, and she beareth a
coffer richer than ever you saw, for it was all of fine gold and
set with precious stones that sparkled like fire.  The coffer is
not large.  The damsel holdeth it between her hands.  When she
was alighted she cometh before the King and saluteth him the
fairest she may and the Queen likewise.  The King returneth her
salute.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "I am come to your court for that it is the
sovran of all other, and so bring I you here this rich vessel
that you see as a gift; and it hath within the head of a knight,
but none may open the coffer save he alone that slew the knight.
Wherefore I pray and beseech you, as you are the best king that
liveth, that you first set your hand thereon, and in like manner
afterwards make proof of your knights, and so the crime and the
blood-wite thereof be brought home to you or to any knight that
may be within yonder.  I pray you that the knight who shall be
able to open the coffer wherein the head of the knight lieth, and
who therefore is he that slew him, shall have grace of forty days
after that you shall be returned from the Graal."
<P>
"Damsel," saith the King, "How shall it be known who the knight
was?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "Right eath, for the letters are sealed within
that tell his name and the name of him that slew him."
<P>
The King granteth the damsel her will in such wise as she had
asked of him.  He hath received the coffer, then maketh her be
set at meat and right richly honoured.
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
When the King had eaten, the damsel cometh before him.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "Make your knights be summoned and ready for
that which you have granted me, and you yourself first of all."
<P>
"Damsel," saith the King, "Right willingly."
<P>
He setteth his hand to the coffer, thinking to open it, but it
was not right that it should open for him.  As he set his hand
thereon the coffer sweated through just as had it been sprinkled
all over and was wet with water.  The King marvelled greatly, and
so made Messire Gawain set his hand to it and Lancelot and all
those of the court, but he that might open it was not among them.
Messire Kay the Seneschal had served at meat.  He heard say that
the King and all the others had essayed and proved the coffer but
might not open it.  He is come thither, all uncalled for.
<P>
"Now, then, Kay," saith the King, "I had forgotten you."
<P>
"By my head," saith Kay, "You ought not to forget me, for as good
knight am I and of as much worth as they that you have called
before me, and you ought not to have delayed to send for me.  You
have summoned all the others, and me not a whit, and yet am I as
well able, or ought to be, to open the coffer as are they; for
against as many knights have I defended me as they, and as many
have I slain in defending my body as have they."
<P>
"Kay," saith the King, "Shall you be so merry and you may open
the coffer, and if you have slain the knight whose head lieth
therein?  By my head, I that am King would fain that the coffer
should not open for me, for never was no knight so poor as that
he should have neither kinsman nor friend, for he is not loved of
all the world that is hated by one man."
<P>
"By my head," saith Kay, "I would that all the heads of all the
knights I have slain, save one only, were in the midst of this
hall, and that there were letters sealed with them to say that
they were slain by me.  Then would you believe what you are not
willing to believe for the envious ones that think they are
better worth than I, and yet have not served you so well."
<P>
<P>
IV.
<P>
"Kay," saith the King, "Come forward, there is no need of this."
<P>
Messire Kay the Seneschal cometh to the dais before the King,
whereon was the coffer, and taketh it right boldly and setteth
one of his hands below it and the other above.  The coffer opened
as soon as he clapped hand thereon, and the head within could be
seen all openly.  A passing delicate-savoured smell and right
sweet issued therefrom, so that not a knight in the hall but
smelt it.
<P>
"Sir," saith Kay to the King, "Now may you know that some prowess
and some hardiment have I done in your service, nor might none of
your knights that you prize so highly open the coffer this day,
nor would you have known this day who is therein for them!  But
now you know it by me, and therefore of so much ought you to be
well pleased with me!"
<P>
<P>
V.
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel that had brought the coffer, "Let the
letters be read that are within, so shall you know who the knight
was and of what lineage, and what was the occasion of his death."
<P>
The King sitteth beside the Queen, and biddeth call one of his
own chaplains.  Then maketh he all the knights in the hall be
seated and keep silence, and commandeth the chaplain that he
should spell out the letters of gold all openly according as he
should find them written.  The chaplain looketh at them, and when
he had scanned them down, began to sigh.
<P>
"Sir," saith he to the King and Queen, "hearken unto me, and all
the other, your knights.
<P>
<P>
VI.
<P>
"These letters say that the knight whose head lieth in this
vessel was named Lohot and he was son of King Arthur and Queen
Guenievre.  He had slain on a day that is past, Logrin the Giant,
by his hardiment.  Messire Kay the Seneschal was passing by
there, and so found Lohot sleeping upon Logrin, for such was his
custom that he went to sleep upon the man after that he had slain
him.  Messire Kay smote off Lohot's head, and so left the head
and the body on the piece of ground.  He took the head of the
Giant and so bore it to the court of King Arthur.  He gave the
King and Queen and all the barons of the court to understand that
he had slain him, but this did he not; rather, that he did was to
slay Lohot, according to the writing and the witness of these
letters."
<P>
When the Queen heareth these letters and this witting of her son
that came thus by his death, she falleth in a swoon on the
coffer.  After that she taketh the head between her two hands,
and knew well that it was he by a scar that he had on his face
when he was a child.  The King himself maketh dole thereof so
sore that none may comfort him, for before these tidings he had
thought that his son was still on live and that he was the Best
Knight in the world, and when the news came to his court that the
Knight of the Golden Circlet had slain the Knight of the Dragon,
he supposed that it had been Lohot his son, for that none had
named Perceval nor Gawain nor Lancelot.  And all they of the
court are right sorrowful for the death of Lohot, and Messire Kay
hath departed, and if the damsel had nor respited the day until
the fortieth after the King's return, vengeance would have been
taken of Kay or ever he might have turned him thence.  For never
did no I man see greater dole made in the King's court than they
of the Table Round made for the youth.  King Arthur and the Queen
were so stricken of sorrow that none durst call upon them to make
cheer.  The damsel that brought thither the coffer was well
avenged of the shame that Messire Kay the Seneschal had done her
on a day that was past, for this thing would not have been known
so soon save it had been by her.
<P>
<P>
VII.
<P>
When the mourning for the King's son was abated, Lancelot and
many others said unto him, "Sir, you know well that God willeth
you should go to the castle that was King Fisherman's on
pilgrimage to the most Holy Graal, for it is not right to delay a
thing that one hath in covenant with God."
<P>
"Lords," saith the King, "right willingly will I go, and thereto
am I right well disposed."
<P>
The King apparelleth himself for the pilgrimage, and saith that
Messire Gawain and Lancelot shall go with him, without more
knights, and taketh a squire to wait upon his body, and the Queen
herself would he have taken thither but for the mourning she made
for her son, whereof none might give her any comfort.  But or
ever the King departed he made the head be brought into the Isle
of Avalon, to a chapel of Our Lady that was there, where was a
worshipful holy hermit that was well loved of Our Lord.  The King
departed from Cardoil and took leave of the Queen and all the
knights.  Lancelot and Messire Gawain go along with him and a
squire that carrieth their arms.  Kay the Seneschal was departed
from the court for dread of the King and his knights.  He durst
not abide in the Greater Britain, and so betook himself into the
Lesser.  Briant of the Isles was of great power in those times, a
knight of great strength and hardiment, for all Great Britain had
had many disputes between him and King Arthur.  His land was full
strong of castles and forests and right fruitful, and many good
knights had he in his land.  When he knew that Kay the Seneschal
had departed in such sort from the court, and that he had crossed
the sea, he sent for him and held him of his household, and said
that he would hold him harmless against the King and against all 
men.  When he knew that the King had departed he began to war
upon the land and to slay his men and to challenge his castles.
