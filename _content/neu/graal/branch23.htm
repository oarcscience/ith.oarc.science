<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXIII</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
Of Perceval the story is here silent, and saith that King Arthur
and Messire Gawain have taken leave of Perceval and all them of
the castle.  The King leaveth him the good destrier that he won,
with the golden crown.  They have ridden, he and Messire Gawain
together, until they are come to a waste ancient castle that
stood in a forest.  The castle would have been right fair and
rich had any folk wonned therein, but none there were save one
old priest and his clerk that lived within by their own toil. 
The King and Messire Gawain lodged there the night, and on the
morrow went into a right rich chapel that was therein to hear
mass, and it was painted all around of right rich colours of gold
and azure and other colours.  The images were right fair that
were there painted, and the Figures of them for whom the images
were made.  The King and Messire Gawain looked at them gladly.
When the mass was said, the priest cometh to them and saith:
"Lords," saith he, "These imagings are right fair, and he that
had them made is full loyal, and dearly loved the lady and her
son for whom he had them made.  Sir," saith the priest, "It is a
true history."
<P>
"Of whom is the history, fair Sir?" saith King Arthur.
<P>
"Of a worshipful vavasour that owned this hold, and of Messire
Gawain, King Arthur's nephew, and his mother. Sir," saith the
priest, "Messire Gawain was born there within and held up and
baptized, as you may see here imaged, and he was named Gawain for
the sake of the lord of this castle that had that name.  His
mother, that had him by King Lot, would not that it should be
known.  She set him in a right fair coffer, and prayed the good
man of this castle that he would carry him away and leave him
where he might perish, but and if he would not do so, she would
make another do it.  This Gawain, that was loyal and would not
that the child should be put to death, made seal letters at the
pillow-bere of his cradle that he was of lineage royal on the one
side and the other, and set therein gold and silver so as that
the child might be nurtured in great plenty, and spread above the
child a right rich coverlid.  He carried him away to a far
distant country, and so came one early morning to a little
homestead where dwelt a right worshipful man.  He delivered the
child to him and his wife, and bade them they should keep him and
nurture him well, and told them that it might be much good should
come to them thereof.  The vavasour turned him back, and they
took charge of the child and nurtured him until that he were
grown, and then took him to Rome to the Holy Father, and showed
him the sealed letters.  The Holy Father saw them and understood
that he was the son of a King.  He had pity upon him, and gave
him to understand that he was of his kindred.  After that, he was
elected to be Emperor of Rome.  But he would not be Emperor lest
he should be reproached of his birth that had before been
concealed from him.  He departed thence, and lived afterwards
within yonder.  Now is it said that he is one of the best knights
in the world, insomuch that none durst take possession of this
castle for dread of him, nor of this great forest that lieth
round about it.  For, when the vavasour that dwelt here was dead,
he left to Messire Gawain, his foster-son, this castle, and made
me guardian thereof until such time as Messire Gawain should
return."
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
The King looketh at Messire Gawain, and seeth him stoop his head
toward the ground for shame.
<P>
"Fair nephew, be not ashamed, for as well might you reproach me
of the same.  Of your birth hath there been great joy, and dearly
ought one to love the place and honour it, where so good a knight
as are you was born."
<P>
When the priest understood that it was Messire Gawain, he made
great cheer to him, and was all ashamed of that he had recorded
as concerning his birth.  But he saith to him: "Sir, small blame
ought you to have herein, for you were confirmed in the law that
God hath established and in loyalty of marriage of King Lot and
your mother.  This thing King Arthur well knoweth, and our Lord
God be praised for that, you have come hither!"
