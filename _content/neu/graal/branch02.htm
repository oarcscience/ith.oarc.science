TITLE I
<P>
King Arthur was at Cardoil with the Queen and right few knights.
By God's pleasure, the wish and the will had come back to him to
win honour and to do largesse as most he might.  He made seal his
letters and sent them throughout all his lands and all the
islands, and gave notice to the barons and knights that he would
hold court at Pannenoisance, that is situate the sea of Wales, at
the feast of S. John after Whitsuntide.  And he was minded to put
it off until that day, for that suntide was already too nigh, and
they that should be thereat might not all come by the earlier
day.  The tidings went through all lands, so that knights come in
great plenty thereunto, for well-doing had so waxed feeble in all
the kingdoms, that every one had avoided King Arthur as one that
should do nought more for ever.  Wherefore all began now to
marvel whence his new desire had come.  The knights of the Table
Round that were scattered through the lands and the forests, by
God's will learnt the tidings and right great joy had they
thereof, and came back to the court with great ado.  But neither
Messire Gawain nor Lancelot came thither on that day.  But all
the other came that were then on live.  S. John's day came, and
the knights were come from all parts, marvelling much that the
King had not held the court at Whitsuntide, but they knew not the
occasion thereof.  The day was fair and clear and the air fresh,
and the hall was wide and high and garnished of good knights in
great plenty.  The cloths were spread on the tables whereof were
great plenty in the hall.  The King and the Queen had washen and
went to sit at the head of one table and the other knights sate
them down, whereof were full five score and five as the story
telleth.  Kay the Seneschal and Messire Ywain the son of King
Urien served that day at the tables at meat, and five-and-twenty
knights beside.  And Lucan the Butler served the golden cup
before the King.  The sun shone through the windows everywhere
amidst the hall that was strown of flowers and rushes and sweet
herbs and gave out a smell like as had it been sprinkled of balm.
And straightway after the first meat had been served, and while
they were yet awaiting the second, behold you three damsels where
they enter into the hall!  She that came first sate upon a mule
white as driven snow and had a golden bridle and a saddle with a
bow of ivory banded with precious stones and a saddle-cloth of a
red samite dropped of gold.  The damsel that was seated on the
mule was right seemly of body but scarce so fair of face, and she
was robed in a rich cloth of silk and gold and had a right rich
hat that covered all her head.  And it was all loaded of costly
stones that flamed like fire.  And great need had she that her
head were covered, for she was all bald without hair, and carried
on her neck her right arm slung in a stole of cloth of gold.  And
her arm lay on a pillow, the richest that ever might be seen, and
it was all charged of little golden bells, and in this hand held
she the head of a King sealed in silver and crowned with gold.
The other damsel that came behind rode after the fashion of a
squire, and carried a pack trussed behind her with a brachet
thereupon, and at her neck she bore a shield banded argent and
azure with a red cross, and the boss was of gold all set with
precious stones.  The third damsel came afoot with her kirtle
tucked up like a running footman; and she had in her hand a whip
wherewith she drove the two steeds.  Each of these twain was
fairer than the first, but the one afoot surpassed both the
others in beauty.  The first cometh before the King, there where
he sitteth at meat with the Queen.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "The Saviour of the world grant you honour and
joy and good adventure and my Lady the Queen and all them of this
hall for love of you!  Hold it not churlishness and I alight not,
for there where knights be may I not alight, nor ought I until
such time as the Graal be achieved."
<P>
"Damsel," saith the King, "Gladly would I have it so."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "That know I well, and may it not mislike you
to hear the errand whereon I am come,"
<P>
"It shall not mislike me," saith the King, "say your pleasure!" 
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "The shield that this damsel beareth belonged
to Joseph, the good soldier knight that took down Our Lord of
hanging on the rood.  I make you a present thereof in such wise
as I shall tell you, to wit, that you keep the shield for a
knight that shall come hither for the same, and you shall make
hang it on this column in the midst of your hall, and guard it in
such wise as that none may take it and hang at his neck save he
only.  And of this shield shall he achieve the Graal, and another
shield shall he leave here in the hall, red, with a white hart;
and the brachet that the damsel carrieth shall here remain, and
little joy will the brachet make until the knight shall come."
<P>
"Damsel," saith the King, "The shield and the brachet will we
keep full safely, and right heartily we thank you that you have
deigned to bring them hither."
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "I have not yet told you all that I have
in charge to deliver.  The best King that liveth on earth and the
most loyal and the most righteous, sendeth you greeting; of whom
is sore sorrow for that he hath fallen into a grievous
languishment."
<P>
"Damsel," saith the King, "Sore pity is it and it be so as you
say; and I pray you tell me who is the King?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "It is rich King Fisherman, of whom is great
grief."
<P>
"Damsel," saith the King, "You say true; and God grant him his
heart's desire!"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "Know you wherefore he hath fallen into
languishment?"
<P>
"Nay, I know not at all, but gladly would I learn."
<P>
"And I will tell you," saith she.  "This languishment is come
upon him through one that harboured in his hostel, to whom the
most Holy Graal appeared.  And, for that he would not ask unto
whom one served thereof, were all the lands commoved to war
thereby, nor never thereafter might knight meet other but he
should fight with him in arms without none other occasion.  You
yourself may well perceive the same, for your well-doing hath
greatly slackened, whereof have you had much blame, and all the
other barons that by you have taken ensample, for you are the
mirror of the world alike in well-doing and in evil-doing.  Sir,
I myself have good right to plain me of the knight, and I will
show you wherefore."
<P>
She lifteth the rich hat from her head and showeth the King and
Queen and the knights in the hall her head all bald without hair.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "My head was right seemly garnished of hair
plaited in rich tresses of gold at such time as the knight came
to the hostel of the rich King Fisherman, but I became bald for
that he made not the demand, nor never again shall I have my hair
until such time as a knight shall go thither that shall ask the
question better than did he, or the knight that shall achieve the
Graal.  Sir, even yet have you not seen the sore mischief that
hath befallen thereof.  There is without this hall a car that
three white harts have drawn hither, and lightly may you send to
see how rich it is. I tell you that the traces are of silk and
the axletrees of gold, and the timber of the car is ebony.  The
car is covered above with a black samite, and below is a cross of
gold the whole length, and under the coverlid of the car are the
heads of an hundred and fifty knights whereof some be sealed in
gold, other some in silver and the third in lead.  King Fisherman
sendeth you word that this loss I hath befallen of him that
demanded not unto whom one serveth of the Graal.  Sir, the damsel
that beareth the shield holdeth in her hand the head of a Queen
that is sealed in lead and crowned with copper, and I tell you
that by the Queen whose head you here behold was the King
betrayed whose head I bear, and the three manner of knights whose
heads are within the car.  Sir, send without to see the
costliness and fashion of the car."
<P>
The King sent Kay the Seneschal to see.  He looked straitly
thereat within and without and thereafter returned to the King.
"Sir," saith he, "Never beheld I car so rich, and there be three
harts withal that draw the car, the tallest and fattest one might
ever see.  But and you will be guided by me, you will take the
foremost, for he is scarce so far, and so might you bid make
right good collops thereof."
<P>
"Avoid there, Kay!" saith the King.  "Foul churlishness have you
spoken!  I would not such a deed were done for another such
kingdom as is this of Logres!"
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "He that hath been wont to do
churlishness doth right grudgingly withdraw himself therefrom.
Messire Kay may say whatsoever him pleaseth, but well know I that
you will pay no heed to his talk.  Sir," saith the damsel,
"Command that the shield be hung on this column and that the
brachet be put in the Queen's chamber with the maidens.  We will
go on our way, for here have we been long enough."
<P>
Messire Ywain laid hold on the shield and took it off the
damsel's neck by leave of the King, and hung it on the column in
the midst of the hall, and one of the Queen's maidens taketh the
brachet and carrieth him to the Queen's chamber.  And the damsel
taketh her leave and turneth again, and the King commendeth her
to God.  When the King eaten in hall, the Queen with the King and
the knights go to lean at the windows to look at the three
damsels and the three white harts that draw the car, and the more
part said that the damsel afoot that went after the two that were
mounted should have the most misease.  The bald damsel went
before, and set not her hat on her head until such time as
behoved her enter into the forest; and the knights that were at
the windows might see them no longer.  Then set she her hat again
upon her head.  The King, the Queen, and the knights when they
might see them no more, came down from the windows, and certain
of them said that never until this time had they seen bald-headed
damsel save this one only.
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
Hereupon the story is silent of King Arthur, and turneth again to
speak of the three damsels and the car that was drawn by the
three white harts.  They are entered into the forest and ride on
right busily.  When they had left the castle some seven leagues
Welsh behind them, they saw a knight coming toward them on the
way they had to go.  The knight sat on a tall horse, lean and
bony.  His habergeon was all rusty and his shield pierced in more
than a dozen places, and the colour thereon was so fretted away
that none might make out the cognizance thereof.  And a right
thick spear bore he in his hand.  When he came anigh the damsel,
he saluted her right nobly.
<P>
"Fair welcome, damsel, to you and your company."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "God grant you joy and good adventure!"
<P>
"Damsel," saith the knight, "Whence come you?"
<P>
"Sir, from a court high-plenary that King Arthur holdeth at
Pannenoisance.  Go you thither, sir knight," saith the damsel,
"to see the King and the Queen and the knights that are there?"
<P>
"Nay, not so!" saith he.  "Many a time have I seen them, but
right glad am I of King Arthur that he hath again taken up his
well-doing, for many a time hath he been accustomed thereof."
<P>
"Whitherward have you now emprised your way?" saith the damsel.
<P>
"To the land of King Fisherman, and God allow me."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "Tell me your name and bide awhile beside me."
<P>
The knight draweth bridle and the damsels and the car come to a
stay.  "Damsel," saith he, "Well behoveth me tell you my name.
Messire Gawain am I called, King Arthur's nephew."
<P>
"What?  are you Messire Gawain?  my heart well told me as much."
<P>
"Yea, damsel," saith he, "Gawain am I."
<P>
"God be praised thereof, for so good knight as are you may well
go see the rich King Fisherman.  Now am I fain to pray you of the
valour that is in you and the courtesy, that you return with me
and convoy me beyond a certain castle that is in this forest
whereof is some small peril."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Willingly, at your pleasure."
<P>
He returneth with the damsel through the midst of the forest that
was tall and leafy and little haunted of folk.  The damsel
relateth to him the adventure of the heads that she carried and
that were in the car, like as she did at the court of King
Arthur, and of the shield and the brachet she had left there, but
much it misliked Messire Gawain of the damsel that was afoot
behind them.  "Damsel,"  saith Messire Gawain, "Wherefore doth
not this damsel that goeth afoot mount upon the car?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "This shall she not, for behoveth her go not
otherwise than afoot.  But and you be so good knight as men say,
betimes will she have done her penance."
<P>
"How so?" saith Gawain.
<P>
"I will tell you," saith she.  "And it shall so be that God bring
you to the hostel of rich King Fisherman, and the most Holy Graal
appear before you and you demand unto whom is served thereof,
then will she have done her penance, and I, that am bald, shall
receive again my hair.  And so you also make not demand thereof,
then will it behove us suffer sore annoy until such time as the
Good knight shall come and shall have achieved the Graal.  For on
account of him that first was there and made not the demand, are
all the lands in sorrow and warfare, and the good King Fisherman
is yet in languishment."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "God grant me courage and will
herein that I may come to do this thing according to your wish,
whereof may I win worship both of God and of the world."
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
Messire Gawain and the damsels go on their way a great pace
through the high forest, green and leafy, where the birds are
singing, and enter into the most hideous forest and most horrible
that any might ever see, and seemed it that no greenery never
there had been, so bare and dry were all the branches and all the
trees black and burnt as it had been by fire, and the ground all
parched and black atop with no green, and full of great cracks.
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Right loathly is this forest and
right hideous.  Goeth it on far like this?"
<P>
"Sir." saith she, "For nine leagues Welsh goeth it on the same,
but we shall pass not through the whole thereof."
<P>
Messire Gawain 1ooketh from time to time on the damsel that
cometh arbor, and sore it irketh him that he may not amend her
estate.  They ride on until that they come to a great valley and
Messire Gawain looketh along the bottom and seeth appear a black
castle that was enclosed within a girdle of wall, foul and
evilseeming.  The nigher he draweth to the castle the more
hideous it seemeth him, and he seeth great halls appear that were
right foully mis-shapen, and the forest about it he seeth to be
like as he had found it behind.  He seeth a water come down from
the head of a mountain, foul and horrible and black, that went
amidst the castle roaring so loud that it seemed to be thunder.
Messire Gawain seeth the entrance of the gateway foul and
horrible like as it had been hell, and within the castle heard he
great outcries and lamentations, and the most part heard he
saying: "Ha, God!  What hath become of the Good Knight, and when
will he come?"
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "What is this castle here that is
so foul and hideous, wherein is such dolour suffered and such
weary longing for the coming of the Good Knight?"
<P>
"Sir, this is the castle of the Black Hermit.  Wherefore am I
fain to pray you that you meddle not herein for nought that they
within may do to me, for otherwise it may well be that your death
is at hand, for against them will you have no might nor power." 
<P>
They come anigh the castle as it were a couple of bow-shots, and
behold, through the gateway come knights armed on black horses
and their arms all black and their shields and spears, and there
were a hundred and fifty and two, right parlous to behold.  And
they come a great gallop toward the damsel, and toward the car,
and take the hundred and fifty-two heads, each one his own, and
set them upon their spears and so enter into the castle again
with great joy.  Messire Gawain seeth the insolence that the
knights have wrought, and right great shame hath he of himself
that he hath not moved withal.
<P>
"Messire Gawain," saith the damsel, "Now may you know how little
would your force have availed you herein."
<P>
"Damsel, an evil castle is this where folk are robbed on such
wise."
<P>
"Sir, never may this mischief be amended, nor this outrage be
done away, nor the evil-doer therein be stricken down, nor they
that cry and lament within the prison there be set free until
such time as the Good Knight shall come for whom are they
yearning as you have heard but now."
<P>
"Damsel, right glad may the knight be that by his valour and his
hardiment shall destroy so many evil folk!"
<P>
"Sir, therefore is he the Best Knight in the world, and he is yet
young enough of age, but right sorrowful am I at heart that I
know not true tidings of him; for better will have I to see him
than any man on live."
<P>
"Damsel, so also have I," saith Messire Gawain, "For then by your
leave would I turn me again."
<P>
"Not so, sir, but and you shall come beyond I the castle, then
will I teach you the way whereby you ought to go."
<P>
<P>
IV.
<P>
With that they go toward the castle all together.  Just as they
were about to pass beyond the castle wall, behold you where a
knight cometh forth of a privy postern of the castle, and he was
sitting upon a tall horse, his spear in his fist, and at his neck
had he a red shield whereon was figured a golden eagle. "Sir
knight," saith he to Messire Gawain, "I pray you bide."
<P>
"What is your pleasure?"
<P>
"You must needs joust with me," saith he "and conquer this
shield, or otherwise I shall conquer you.  And full precious is
the shield, insomuch as that great pains ought you to take to
have it and conquer it, for it belonged to the best knight of his
faith that was ever, and the most puissant and the wisest."
<P>
"Who, then, was he?" saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
"Judas Machabee was he, and he it was that first wrought how by
one bird to take another."
<P>
"You say true," saith Messire Gawain; "A good knight was he." 
<P>
"Therefore right joyful may you be," saith he, "and you may
conquer the same, for your own is the poorest and most battered
that ever saw I borne by knight.  For hardly may a man know the
colour thereof."
<P>
"Thereby may you well see," saith the damsel to the knight, "that
his own shield hath not been idle, nor hath the horse whereon he
sitteth been stabled so well as yours."
<P>
"Damsel," saith the knight, "No need is here of long pleading.
Needs must he joust with me, for him do I defy."
<P>
Saith Messire Gawain, "I hear well that you say."
<P>
He draweth him back and taketh his career and the knight
likewise, and they come together as fast as their horses may
carry them, spear in rest.  The knight smiteth Messire Gawain on
the shield whereof he had no great defence, and passeth beyond,
and in the by-pass the knight to-brake his spear; and Messire
Gawain smiteth him with his spear in the midst of his breast and
beareth him to the ground over the croup of his horse, all pinned
upon his spear, whereof he had a good full hand's breadth in his
breast.  He draweth his spear back to him, and when the knight
felt himself unpinned, he leaped to his feet and came straight to
his horse and would fain set his foot in the stirrup when the
damsel of the car crieth out: "Messire Gawain, hinder the knight!
for and he were mounted again, too sore travail would it be to
conquer him!"
<P>
When the knight heard name Messire Gawain, he draweth him back:
"How?" saith he; "Is this then the good Gawain, King Arthur's
nephew?"
<P>
"Yea," saith the damsel, "He it is without fail!"
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight to Messire Gawain, "Are you he?"
<P>
"Yea," saith he, "Gawain I am!"
<P>
"Sir, so please you," saith he, "I hold me conquered, and right
sorry am I that I knew you not or ever I had ado with you."
<P>
He taketh the shield from his neck and holdeth it to him.  "Sir,"
saith he, "Take the shield that belonged to the best knight that
was in his time of his faith, for none know I of whom it shall be
better employed than of you.  And of this shield were vanquished
all they that be in prison in this castle."  Messire Gawain
taketh the shield that was right fair and rich.
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "Now give me yours, for you will not
bear two shields."
<P>
"You say true," saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
He taketh the guige from his neck and would have given him the
shield, when the damsel afoot: "Hold, sir knight, you that are
named Messire Gawain!  What would you do?  And he bear your
shield into the castle there, they of the castle will hold you
recreant and conquered, and will come forth thence and carry you
into the castle by force, and there will you be cast into his
grievous prison; for no shield is borne thereinto save of a
vanquished knight only."
<P>
"Sir knight," saith Messire Gawain, "No good you wish me,
according to that this damsel saith."
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "I cry you mercy, and a second time I
hold me conquered, and right glad should I have been might I have
borne your shield within yonder, and right great worship should I
have had thereof, for never yet hath entered there the shield of
knight so good.  And now ought I to be right well pleased of your
coming, sith that you have set me free of the sorest trouble that
ever knight had."
<P>
"What is the trouble?" saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
"Sir," saith he, "I will tell you.  Heretofore many a time hath
there been a passing by of knights both of hardy and of coward,
and it was my business to contend and joust with them and do
battle, and I made them present of the shield as did I you.  The
more part found I hardy and well able to defend themselves, that
wounded me in many places, but never was knight so felled me to
the ground nor dealt me so sore a buffet as have you.  And sith
that you are carrying away the shield and I am conquered, never
here-after shall knight that passeth before this castle have no
dread of me nor of no knight that is herein."
<P>
"By my head," saith Messire Gawain, "Now am I gladder of my
conquest than I was before."
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "By your leave will I go my way, for,
and I may hide not my shame in the castle, needs must I show it
openly abroad."
<P>
"God grant you do well!" saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
"Messire Gawain," saith the Damsel of the Car, "give me your
shield that the knight would fain have carried off."
<P>
"Willingly, damsel," saith he.  The damsel that went afoot taketh
the shield and setteth it in the car.  Howbeit, the knight that
was conquered mounted again upon his horse, and entered again
into the castle, and when he was come thereinto, arose a noise
and great outcry so loud that all the forest and all the valley
began to resound thereof.  "Messire Gawain," saith the Damsel of
the Car, "the knight is shamed and there cast in prison another
time.  Now haste, Messire Gawain!  for now may you go!"
<P>
With that they all set forward again upon their way together, and
leave the castle an English league behind.  "Damsel," saith
Messire Gawain, "When it shall please you, I shall have your
leave to go."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "God be guard of your body, and right great
thanks of your convoy."
<P>
"Lady," saith he, "My service is always ready at your command."
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "Gramercy, and your own way see you
there by yonder great cross at the entrance of yonder forest. 
And beyond that, will you find the fairest forest and most
delightsome when you shall have passed through this that sore is
wearisome."
<P>
Messire Gawain turneth him to go, and the damsel afoot crieth out
to him: "Sir, not so heedful are you as I supposed."
<P>
Messire Gawain turneth his horse's head as he that was startled:
"Wherefore say you so, damsel?" saith he.
<P>
"For this," saith she, "That you have never asked of my Damsel
wherefore she carrieth her arm slung at her neck in this golden
stole, nor what may be the rich pillow whereon the arm lieth. 
And no greater heed will you take at the court of the rich King
Fisherman."
<P>
"Sweet, my friend," saith the Damsel of the Car, "blame not
Messire Gawain only, but King Arthur before him and all the
knights that were in the court.  For not one of them all that
were there was so heedful as to ask me.  Go your ways, Messire
Gawain, for in vain would you now demand it, for I will tell you
not, nor shall you never know it save only by the most coward
knight in the world, that is mine own knight and goeth to seek me
and knoweth not where to find me."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "I durst not press you further."
<P>
With that the Damsel departeth, and Messire Gawain setteth him
forward again on the way that she had taught him.
