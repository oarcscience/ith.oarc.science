<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXXI</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
Thereupon the story is silent of Lancelot, and cometh back to
Perceval that had not heard these tidings, and if he had known
them, right sorrowful would he have been thereof.  He is departed
from his uncle's castle that he hath reconquered, and was sore
grieved of the tidings that the damsel that was wounded brought
him of his sister that Aristor had carried away by force to the
house of a vavasour.  He was about to take her to wife and cut
off her head on the day of the New Year, for such was his custom
with all them that he took.  Perceval rideth one day, all heavy
in thought, and taketh his way as fast as he may toward the
hermitage of his uncle King Hermit.  He is come thither on an
eventide, and seeth three hermits issued forth of the hermitage.
He alighteth and goeth to meet them so soon as he seeth them.
<P>
"Sir," say the hermits, "Enter not in, for they are laying out a
body there."
<P>
"Who is it?" saith Perceval.
<P>
"Sir," say the hermits, "It is the good King Pelles that Aristor
slew suddenly after mass on account of one of his nephews,
Perceval, whom he loveth not, and a damsel is laying out the body
there within."
<P>
When Perceval heard the news or his uncle that is dead, thereof
was he right grieved at heart, and on the morrow was he at his
uncle's burial.  When mass was sung, Perceval would have
departed, as he that had great desire to take vengeance on him
that had done him such shame.
<P>

II.
<P>
Thereupon behold you the damsel that is his.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "Full long time have I been seeking you. 
Behold here the head of a knight that I carry hanging at the bow
of my saddle, in this rich casket of ivory that you may see, and
by none ought he to be avenged but by you alone.  Discharge me
thereof, fair Sir, of your courtesy, for I have carried it too
long a time, and this King Arthur knoweth well and Messire
Gawain, for each hath seen me at court along with the head, but
they could give me no tidings of you, and my castle may I not
have again until such time as he be avenged."
<P>
"Who, then, was the knight, damsel?" saith Perceval.
<P>
"Sir, he was son of your uncle Bruns Brandalis, and were he on
live, would have been one of the best knights in the world."
<P>
"And who slew him, damsel?" saith Perceval.
<P>
"Sir, the Knight of the Deep Forest that leadeth the lion, foully
in treason there where he thought him safe.  For had he been
armed in like manner as was the other, he would not have slain
him."
<P>
"Damsel," said Perceval, "This grieveth me that he hath slain
him, and it grieveth me likewise of mine uncle King Hermit, whom
I would avenge more willingly than all the men in the world, for
he was slain on my account."
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
"Most disloyal was this knight, and foully was he fain to avenge
him when he slew a holy man, a hermit that never wished him ill
on account of me and of none other.  Right glad shall I be and I
may find the knight, and so, methinketh, will he be of me, for me
he hateth as much as I do him, as I have been told, and Lord God
grant, howsoever he may take it, that I may find him betimes."
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "So outrageous a knight is he that no
knight is there in the world so good but he thinketh himself of
more worth than he, and sith that he hateth you with a will, and
he knew that you were here, you and another, or you the third, he
would come now at once, were he in place and free."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Perceval, "God give him mischief of his coming,
come whensoever he may!"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "The Deep Forest there, where the Red Knight
leadeth the lion, is towards the castle of Aristor, and, or ever
you come by adventure into the forest, you may well hear some
tidings of him!"
