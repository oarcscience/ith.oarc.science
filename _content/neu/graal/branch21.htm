<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXI</H1>
TITLE I.
<P>
Therewithal the history is silent of Lancelot, and speaketh word
of the King and Messire Gawain, that are in sore misgiving as
concerning him, for right gladly would they have heard tidings of
him.  They met a knight that was coming all armed, and Messire
Gawain asketh him whence he came, and he said that he came from
the land of the Queen of the Golden Circlet, to whom a sore loss
hath befallen; for the Son of the Widow Lady had won the Circlet
of Gold for that he had slain the Knight of the Dragon, and she
was to keep it safe for him and deliver it up to him at his will.
<P>
"But now hath Nabigant of the Rock reft her thereof, and a right
outrageous knight is he and puissant; wherefore hath he commanded
a damsel that she bring it to an assembly of knights that is to
be held in the Meadow of the Tent of the two damsels, there where
Messire Gawain did away the evil custom.  The damsel that will
bring the Golden Circlet will give it to the knight that shall do
best at the assembly.  Nabigant is keenly set upon having it, and
maketh the more sure for that once aforetime he hath had it by
force of arms.  And I am going to the knights that know not these
tidings, in order that when they shall hear them, they shall go
to the assembly."
<P>
Therewithal the knight departeth.  The King and Messire Gawain
have ridden so far that they come to the tent where Messire
Gawain destroyed the evil custom by slaying the two knights.  He
found the tent garnished within and without in like manner as it
was when he was there, and Messire Gawain made the King be seated
on a quilted mattress of straw, right costly, and thereafter be
disarmed of a squire, and he himself disarmed him, and they
washed their hands and faces for the rust wherewith both of them
were besmuttered.  And Messire Gawain found the chests unlocked
that were at the head of the couch, and made the King be
apparelled of white rich stuffs that he found, and a robe of
cloth of silk and gold, and he clad himself in the like manner,
neither was the chest not a whit disfurnished thereby, for the
tent was all garnished of rich adornments.  When they were thus
dight, a man might have sought far or ever he should find so
comely knights.
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
Thereupon, behold you the two Damsels of the Tent coming.
<P>
"Damsels," saith Messire Gawain, "Welcome may you be."
<P>
"Sir," say they, "Good adventure may you have both twain.  It
seemeth us that you take right boldly that which is ours, yet
never for neither of us would you do a thing whereof you were
beseeched."
<P>
"Messire Gawain" saith the elder, "No knight is there in this
kingdom but would be right joyous and he supposed that I loved
him, and I prayed you of your love on a day that is past, for the
valour of your knighthood, yet never did you grant it me.  How
durst you have affiance in me of aught, and take the things that
are mine own so boldly, when I may not have affiance in you?"
<P>
"Damsel, for your courtesy and the good custom of the land; for
you told me when the evil customs were overthrown, that all the
honours and all the courtesies that are due to knights should
ever be ready within for all them that should come hither for
harbour."
<P>
"Messire Gawain, you say true, but of right might one let the
courtesy tarry and pay back churlishness by churlishness."
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
"The assembly of knights will begin to-morrow in this launde that
is so fair.  There will be knights in plenty, and the prize will
be the Circlet of Gold.  Now shall we see who will do best.  The
assembly will last three whole days, and of one thing at least
you may well make boast between you and your comrade, that you
have the fairest hostel and the most pleasant and the most quiet
of any knights at the assembly."
<P>
The younger damsel looketh at King Arthur.  "And you," saith she,
What will you do?  Will you be as strange toward us as Messire
Gawain is friendly with others?"
<P>
<P>
IV.
<P>
"Damsel," saith the king, "Messire Gawain will do his pleasure
and I mine.  Strange shall I not be in respect of you, nor toward
other damsels; rather shall they be honoured on my part so long
as I live, and I myself will be at your commandment."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "Gramercy greatly.  I pray you, therefore, that
you be my knight at the tournament."
<P>
"Damsel, this ought I not to refuse you, and right glad at heart
shall I be and I may do aught that shall please you; for all
knights ought to be at pains for the sake of dame or damsel."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "what is your name?"
<P>
<P>
V.
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "My name is Arthur, and I am of Tincardoil."
<P>
"Have you nought to do with King Arthur?"
<P>
"Damsel, already have I been many times at his court, and, if he
loved me not nor I him, I should not be in Messire Gawain's
company.  In truth, he is the King in the world that I love
best."
<P>
The damsel looketh at King Arthur, but wotteth not a whir that it
is he, and full well is she pleased with the seeming and
countenance of him.  As for the King, lightly might he have
trusted that he should have her as his lady-love so long as he
remained with her; but there is much to say betwixt his semblant
and his thought, for he showeth good semblant toward the damsel,
that hath over much affiance therein, but his thought is on Queen
Guenievre in what place soever he may be.  For nought loveth he
so well as her.
<P>
<P>
VI.
<P>
The damsels made stable the horses and purvey for the bodies of
the knights right richly at night, and they lay in two right rich
beds in the midst of the hall, and their arms were all set ready
before.  The damsels would not depart until such time as they
were asleep.  The harness of the knights that came to the
assembly came on the morrow from all parts.  They set up their
booths and stretched their tents all round about the launde of
the forest.  King Arthur and Messire Gawain were risen in the
morning and saw the knights come from all parts.  The elder
damsel cometh to Messire Gawain and saith unto him, "Sir," saith
she, "I will that you bear to-day red arms that I will lend you,
for the love of me, and take heed that they be well employed, and
I desire that you should not be known by your arms; rather let it
be said that you are the Red Knight, and you shall allow it
accordingly."
<P>
"Damsel, Gramercy greatly!" saith Messire Gawain,  "I will do my
endeavour in arms the best I may for love of you."
<P>
The younger damsel cometh to King Arthur; "Sir," saith she, "My
sister hath made her gift and I will make mine.  I have a suit of
arms of gold, the richest that knight may wear, that I will lend
you, for methinketh they will be better employed on you than on
ever another knight; so I pray you that you remember me at the
assembly in like manner as I shall ofttimes remember you."
<P>
<P>
VII.
<P>
"Damsel," saith the King, "Gramercy!  No knight is there that
should see you but ought to have you in remembrance in his heart
for your courtesy and your worth."
<P>
The knights were come about the tents.  The King and Messire
Gawain were armed and had made caparison their horses right
richly.  The damsel that should give the Golden Circlet was come.
Nabigant of the Rock had brought great fellowships of knights
together with him, and ordinance was made for the assembly.
<P>
<P>
VIII.
<P>
The younger damsel saith to King Arthur: "Well may you know that
no knight that is here this day hath better arms than are yours,
wherefore take heed that you show you to be good knight for love
of me."
<P>
"Damsel," saith King Arthur, "God grant that I be so."
<P>
So they laid hold on their reins and mounted their horses, that
made great leaping and went away a great gallop.  Saith the
younger damsel to her sister: "What think you of my knight, doth
he not please you?"
<P>
"Yea," saith the elder, "But sore misliketh me of Messire Gawain
for that he is not minded to do as I would have him.  But he
shall yet aby it dear."
<P>
King Arthur and Messire Gawain strike into the midst of the
assembly like as it were two lions unchained, and at their first
coming they smite down two knights to the ground under the feet
of their horses.  Messire Gawain taketh the two horses and
sendeth them by a squire to the Damsels of the Tent, that made
much joy thereof.  After that were they not minded to take more
booty as of horses or arms, but searched the fellowships on one
side and the other; nor was there no knight that came against
them but they pierced his shield or bore him to the ground,
insomuch as none was there that might endure their buffets.
Nabigant espieth Messire Gawain and cometh toward him, and
Messire Gawain toward him again, and they hurtle together either
on other so strongly that Messire Gawain beareth Nabigant to the
ground, him and his horse together all in a heap.  And King
Arthur was not idle, for no knight durst come against him but he
overthrew him, so as that all withdrew them back and avoided his
buffets.  And many knights did well that day at the assembly, but
none might be the match of either of them twain in deeds of arms,
for, save it were Lancelot or Perceval, were no knights on live
that had in them so much hardiment and valour.  After that it was
evensong the knights drew them back to their tents, and they say
all that the Knight of the Golden Arms and the Knight of the Red
Arms had done better than they all at the assembly.  King Arthur
and Messire Gawain come back to the tent of the damsels, that
make disarm them and do upon them the rich robes and make great
joy of them.  Thereupon, behold you, a dwarf that cometh:
"Damsels, make great joy!  for all they of the assembly say with
one accord that your knights have done best this day."
<P>
King Arthur and Messire Gawain sate to eat, and right well were
they served of every kind of meats and of great cups of wine and
sops in wine.  King Arthur made the younger damsel sit beside
him, and Messire Gawain the elder in like manner, and when they
had eaten they went to lie down and fell on sleep, for right sore
weary were they and forespent of the many buffets they had given
and received, and they slept until the morrow.
<P>
<P>
IX.
<P>
When the day appeared they rose up.  Thereupon, behold you the
younger damsel where she cometh and saluteth King Arthur.  "And
you, damsel!" saith King Arthur, "God give you joy and good
adventure!"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "I will that you bear to-day these white arms
that you see here, and that you do no worse to-day than yesterday
you did, sith that better you may not do."
<P>
"Messire Gawain," saith the elder damsel, "Remember you of the
King there where his land was compassed about of a wall of stone,
and you harboured one night in his castle, what time you went to
seek for the sword wherewith John Baptist was beheaded, when he
was fain to take away the sword from you, whereof you had so sore
misliking?  Natheless, he yielded you up the sword upon covenant
that you should do that which a damsel should first ask you to do
thereafter, and you promised him loyally that so would you do?"
<P>
"Certes, damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Well do I remember the
same."
<P>
"Now, therefore," saith the damsel, "would I fain prove whether
you be indeed so loyal as men say, and whether you will hold your
covenant that you made.  Wherefore I pray and beseech you that
this day you shall be he that doth worst of all the knights at
the assembly, and that you bear none other arms save your own
only, so as that you shall be known again of all them that are
there present.  And, so you will not do this, then will you have
failed of your covenant, and myself will go tell the King that
you have broken the promise that you made to him right loyally."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Never yet brake I covenant with
none, so it were such as I might fulfil or another on my behalf." 
<P>
King Arthur made arm him of the white arms that the younger
damsel had given him, and Messire Gawain of his own, but sore it
irked him of this that the damsel hath laid upon him to do, sith
that needs must he lose worship and he hold to his covenant,
albeit not for nought that is in the world will he fail of the
promise he hath made.  So they come into the assembly.
<P>
<P>
X.
<P>
King Arthur smiteth with his spurs like a good knight and
overthroweth two knights in his onset, and Messire Gawain rideth
a bandon betwixt two fellowships to be the better known.  The
most part say, "See!  There is Messire Gawain, the good knight
that is King Arthur's nephew."
<P>
Nabigant of the Rock cometh toward him as fast as his horse may
carry him, lance in rest.  Messire Gawain seeth him coming toward
him right furiously.  He casteth his shield down on the ground
and betaketh him to flight as swiftly as he may.  They that
beheld him, some two score or more, marvel thereof, and say, "Did
ever one see the like overpassing cowardize!"
<P>
Nabigant saith that he never yet followed a knight that was
vanquished, nor never will follow one of such conditions, for no
great prize would it be to take him and win his horse.  Other
knights come to joust with him, but Messire Gawain fleeth and
avoideth them the best he may, and maketh semblance that none is
there he durst abide.  He draweth toward King Arthur for safety.
"The King hath great shame of this that he seeth him do, and
right sore pains hath he of defending Messire Gawain, for he
holdeth as close to him as the pie doth to the bramble when the
falcon would take her.  In such shame and dishonour was Messire
Gawain as long as the assembly lasted, and the knights said that
he had gotten him off with much less than he deserved, for that
never had they seen so craven knight at assembly or tournament as
was he, nor never henceforth would they have dread of him as they
had heretofore.  From this day forward may many lightly avenge
themselves upon him of their kinsfolk and friends that he hath
slain by the forest.   The assembly brake up in the evening,
whereof the King and Messire Gawain were right well pleased.  The
knights disarm them at their hostels and the King and Messire
Gawain at the damsels' tent.
<P>
<P>
XI.
<P>
With that, behold you the dwarf that cometh.
<P>
"By my head, damsels, your knights go from bad to worse!  Of him
in the white arms one may even let pass, but Messire Gawain is
the most coward ever saw I yet, and so he were to run upon me
to-morrow and I were armed like as is he, I should think me right
well able to defend me against him. 'Tis the devil took him to a
place where is such plenty of knights, for the more folk that are
there the better may one judge of his ill conditions.  And you,
Sir," saith he to the King, "Wherefore do you keep him company?
You would have done best to-day had he not been there.  He
skulked as close by you, to be out of the buffets, as a hare doth
to the wood for the hounds.  No business hath good knight to hold
company with a coward.  I say not this for that I would make him
out worse that he is, for I remember the two knights he slew
before this tent."
<P>
The damsel heareth the dwarf talking and smileth thereat, for she
understandeth that blame enough hath Messire Gawain had at the
assembly.  The knights said at their hostels that they knew not
to whom to give the Circlet of Gold, sith that the Knight of the
Golden Armour and he of the Red Armour were not there; for they
did the best the first day of the assembly, and much they
marvelled that they should not come when it was continued on the
morrow.
<P>
"Gawain," saith the King, "Sore blame have you had this day, and
I myself have been all shamed for your sake.  Never thought I
that so good a knight as you might ever have known how to
counterfeit a bad knight as you did.  You have done much for the
love of the damsel, and right well had she avenged herself of you
and you had done her great annoy.  Howbeit, and to-morrow your
cowardize be such as it hath been to-day, never will the day be
when you shall not have blame thereof."
<P>
<P>
XII.
<P>
"By my faith." saith Messire Gawain, "Behoveth me do the damsel's
pleasure sith that we have fallen by ill-chance into her power."
<P>
They went to bed at night and took their rest as soon as they had
eaten, and on the morrow the damsel came to Messire Gawain.
<P>
"I will," saith she, "that you be clad in the same arms as was
your comrade on the first day, right rich, that I will lend you,
and I will, moreover, that you be knight so good as that never on
any day were you better.  But I command you, by the faith you
pledged me the other day, to obey this caution, that you make
yourself known to none, and so any man in the world shall ask
your name, you shall say that you are the knight of the Golden
Arms."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Gawain, "Gramercy, I will do your pleasure."
<P>
The younger damsel cometh back to the King: "Sir," saith she, "I
will that you wear new arms: You shall bear them red, the same as
Messire Gawain bore the first day, and I pray you be such as you
were the first day, or better."
<P>
<P>
XIII.
<P>
"Damsel, I will do my best to amend myself and my doings, and
right well pleased am I of that it pleaseth you to say."
<P>
Their horses were caparisoned and the knights mounted, all armed.
They come together to the tournament with such an onset as that
they pass through the thickest of the press and overthrew knights
and horses as many as they encountered.  King Arthur espieth
Nabigant that came right gaily caparisoned, and smiteth him so
passing strong a buffet in the midst of his breast that he
beareth him down from his horse, in such sort that he breaketh
his collar-bone, and presenteth the destrier, by his squire, to
the younger damsel, that maketh great joy thereof.  And Messire
Gawain searcheth the fellowships on all sides, and so well did he
search that scarce was one might endure his blows.  King Arthur
is not idle, but pierceth shields and beateth in helms, the while
all look on in wonderment at him and Messire Gawain.  The story
saith that the King would have done still better, but that he put
not forth his full strength in deeds of arms, for that Messire
Gawain had done so ill the day before, and now he would fain that
he should have the prize.
<P>
<P>
XIV.
<P>
The damsel that held the Golden Circlet was in the midst of the
assembly of knights, and had set it in a right rich casket of
ivory with precious stones, right worshipfully.  When the damsel
saw that the assembly was at an end, she made all the knights
stay, and prayed them they should speak judgment true, concealing
nought, who had best deserved of arms, and ought therefore of
right to have the Golden Circle.  They said all, that of right
judgment the Knight of the Golden Arms and he of the Red Arms
ought to have the prize above all the others, but that of these
two, he of the Golden Arms ought to have the prize, for so well
did he the first day as that no knight might do better, and on
the last day likewise, and that if he of the Red Arms had put
forth his full strength on the last day, he would have done full
as well or better.  The Circlet of Gold was brought to Messire
Gawain, but it was not known that it was he; and Messire Gawain
would fain that it had been given to my Lord King Arthur.  The
knights departed from the assembly.  The King and Messire Gawain
came back to the tent and brought the Golden Circlet, whereof the
damsels made great joy.  Thereupon, behold you!  the dwarf that
cometh back.
<P>
"Damsels, better is it to lodge knights such as these than
Messire Gawain the coward, the craven that had so much shame at
the assembly!  You yourselves would have been sore blamed had you
lodged him.  This knight hath won the Golden Circlet by force of
arms, and Messire Gawain nought but shame and reproach."
<P>
The damsel laugheth at this that the dwarf saith, and biddeth him
on his eyes and head, begone!
<P>
<P>
XV.
<P>
The King and Messire Gawain were disarmed.
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "What will you do with the Golden
Circlet?"
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "I will bear it to him that first
won it in sore peril of death, and delivered it to the Queen that
ought to have kept it safe, of whom it hath been reft by force."
<P>
The King and Messire Gawain lay the night in the tent.  The
younger damsel cometh to the King.
<P>
"Sir, many feats of arms have you done at the assembly, as I have
been told, for love of me, and I am ready to reward you."
<P>
"Damsel, right great thanks.  Your reward and your service love I
much, and your honour yet more, wherefore I would that you should
have all the honour that any damsel may have, for in damsel
without honour ought none to put his affiance.  Our Lord God
grant you to preserve yours."
<P>
"Damsel," saith she to the other that sitteth before Messire
Gawain, "This Knight and Messire Gawain have taken counsel
together.  There is neither solace nor comfort in them.  Let us
leave them to go to sleep, and ill rest may they have, and Lord
God defend us ever hereafter from such guests."
<P>
"By my head," saith the eider damsel, "were it not for the Golden
Circlet that he is bound of right to deliver again to the Queen
that had it in charge, who is my Lady, they should not depart
from this land in such sort as they will.  But, and Messire
Gawain still be nice as concerneth damsels, at least I now know
well that he is loyal in anotherwise, so as that he will not fail
of his word."
<P>
<P>
XVI.
<P>
With that the damsels departed, as did likewise the King and
Messire Gawain as soon as they saw the day.  Nabigant, that was
wounded at the tournament, was borne away on a litter.  Meliot of
Logres was in quest of Messire Gawain.  He met the knights and
the harness that came from the assembly, and asked of many if
they could tell him tidings of King Arthur's nephew, Messire
Gawain, and the most part answer, "Yea, and right bad tidings
enough."
<P>
Then they ask him wherefore he demandeth.
<P>
"Lords," saith he, "His liege man am I, and he ought of right to
defend my land against all men, that Nabigant hath taken from me
without right nor reason, whom they are carrying from thence in a
litter, wherefore I am fain to beseech Messire Gawain that he
help me to recover my land."
<P>
"In faith, Sir Knight," say they, "We know not of what avail he
may be to others that may not help himself.  Messire Gawain was
at the assembly, but we tell you for true, it was he that did
worst thereat."
<P>
"Alas," saith Meliot of Logres, "Then have I lost my land, and he
hath become even such an one as you tell me."
<P>
"You would readily believe us," say they, "had you seen him at
the assembly!"
<P>
Meliot turneth him back, right sorrowful.
<P>
<P>
XVII.
<P>
King Arthur and Messire Gawain depart from the tent, and come a
great pace as though they fain would escape thence to come nigher
the land where they would be, and great desire had they of the
coming of Lancelot.  They rode until that they came one night to
the Waste Manor whither the brachet led Messire Gawain when he
found the dead knight that Lancelot had slain.  They lodged there
the night, and found there knights and damsels of whom they were
known.  The Lady of the Waste Manor sent for succour to her
knights, saying that she held there King Arthur that slew other
knights, and that his nephew Messire Gawain was also there
within, but dearly would she have loved that Lancelot had been
with them that slew her brother.  Knights in plenty came to her
to do hurt to King Arthur and Messire Gawain, but she had at
least so much courtesy in her that she would not suffer any of
them to do them ill within her hold, albeit she kept seven of
their number, full of great hardiment, to guard the entrance of
the bridge, so that King Arthur and Messire Gawain might not
depart thence save only amidst the points of their spears.
<P>
<P>
XVIII.
<P>
This high history witnesseth us that Lancelot was departed from
the Waste City wherein he was much honoured, and rode until that
he came to a forest where he met Meliot of Logres, that was sore
dismayed of the tidings he had heard of Messire Gawain.  Lancelot
asketh him whence he cometh, and he saith from seeking Messire
Gawain, of whom he had tidings whereof he was right sorrowful. 
<P>
"How," saith Lancelot, "Is he then otherwise than well?"
<P>
"Yea," saith he, "As I have heard tell: for he wont to be good
knight and hath now become evil.  He was at the assembly of
knights whereof I met the harness and the fellowships, and they
told me that never yet was such cowardize in any knight, but that
a knight who was with him did right well.  But howsoever he may
have borne himself, right fain am I to find him, for, maugre what
any may say, I may scarce believe that he is so bad after all."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "I will seek him for you, and you can come
along with me and it seemeth you good."
<P>
Meliot of Logres betaketh him back with Lancelot.  They ride
until they happen by chance upon the Waste Manor where the King
and Messire Gawain were lodged; and they were armed, and were
minded to go forth from thence.  But the seven knights guarded
the issue, all armed.  The King and Messire Gawain saw that no
good would it do them to remain there within, wherefore they
passed over the bridge and came perforce to the place where the
seven knights were watching for them.  Thereupon, they went
toward them all armed and struck among them, and the knights
received them on the points of their lances.
<P>
<P>
XIX.
<P>
Thereupon, behold you!  Lancelot and the knight with him, whom
they had not been looking for.  Lancelot espied the King and
Messire Gawain; then the knights cried out and struck among them
as a hawk striketh amongst larks, and made them scatter on one
side and the other.  Lancelot hath caught one at his coming, and
smiteth him with his spear through the body, and Meliot of Logres
slayeth another.  King Arthur knew Lancelot, and right glad was
he to see him safe and sound, as was Messire Gawain likewise.
Lancelot and Meliot of Logres made clear the passage for them.
The knights departed, for longer durst they not abide.  The
damsel of the castle held a squire by the hand, that was right
passing comely.  She knew Lancelot, and when she saw him she
called him.
<P>
<P>
XX.
<P>
"Lancelot, you slew this squire's brother, and, please God,
either he or another shall take vengeance thereof."
<P>
Lancelot holdeth his peace when he heareth the dame speak, and
departeth from the Waste Hold.  Meliot of Logres knew Messire
Gawain and Messire Gawain him again, and great joy made they the
one of the other.
<P>
"Sir," saith Meliot, "I am come to lay plaint before you of
Nabigant of the Rock that challengeth me of the land whereof I am
your man, and saith that he will defend it against none but you
only.  Sir, the day is full nigh, and if you come not to the day,
I shall have lost my quarrel, and you held me thereof in covenant
what time I became your man."
<P>
"Right fainly will I go," saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
He goeth his way thither accordingly by leave of the King and
Lancelot, and saith that he will return to them the speediest he
may.
<P>
<P>
XXI.
<P>
King Arthur and Lancelot go their way as fast as they may toward
the land that was King Fisherman's.  Messire Gawain rideth until
he cometh to the land of Nabigant of the Rock. Meliot doeth
Nabigant to wit that Messire Gawain was come, and that he was
ready to uphold his right by him that was his champion.  Nabigant
was whole of the wound he gat at the assembly, and held Messire
Gawain of full small account for the cowardize that he saw him
do, and bid his knights not meddle betwixt them two, for, and
Messire Gawain had been four knights he thought to vanquish them
all.  He issueth forth of his castle all armed, and is come there
where Messire Gawain awaited him.  Messire Gawain seeth him
coming, and so draweth on one side, and Nabigant, that was stark
outrageous, setteth his spear in rest and cometh toward Messire
Gawain without another word, and smiteth him on the shield so
that he maketh his spear fly all in pieces.  And Messire Gawain
catcheth him right in the midst of his breast, and pierceth him
with his spear through the thick of his heart, and he falleth to
the ground dead; and the knights run upon Messire Gawain; but he
lightly delivereth himself of them, and Meliot of Logres
likewise.  Messire Gawain entereth the castle by force, doing
battle against all the knights, and holdeth them in such a pass
as that he maketh them do homage to Meliot of Logres, and deliver
up to him the keys of the castle.  He maketh them come to an
assembly from the whole of the land they had reft away from him,
and thereafter departeth and followeth after King Arthur.  In the
forest, he overtaketh a damsel that was going on her way a great
pace.
<P>
<P>
XXII.
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Lord God guide you, whither away
so fast?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "I am going to the greatest assembly of knights
you saw ever."
<P>
"What assembly?" saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "At the Palace Meadow, but the knight I am
seeking is he that won the Circlet of Gold at the Meadow of the
Tent.  Fair Sir, can you give me any tidings of him?" saith she. 
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "What would you do herein?"
<P>
"Certes, Sir, I would right fain find him.  My Lady, that kept
the Circlet of Gold for the son of the Widow Lady, that won it
aforetime, hath sent me to seek him."
<P>
"For what intent, damsel?" saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
"Sir, my Lady sendeth for him and beseecheth him by me, for the
sake of the Saviour of the World, that if he had ever pity of
dame or damsel, he will take vengeance on Nabigant that hath
slain her men and destroyed her land, for she hath been told how
he that won back the Golden Circlet ought of right to take
vengeance upon him."
<P>
<P>
XXIII.
<P>
"Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Be not any longer troubled
hereof, for I tell you that the knight that won the Golden
Circlet by prize of arms hath killed Nabigant already."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "How know you this?"
<P>
"I know the knight well," saith he, "And I saw him slay him, and
behold, here is the Circlet of Gold that I have as a token
hereof, for that he beareth it to him that hath won the Graal, to
the intent that your Lady may be quit of her charge."
<P>
Messire Gawain showeth her the Golden Circlet in the casket of
ivory, that he kept very nigh himself.  Right joyful was the
damsel that the matter had thus fallen out, and goeth her way
back again to tell her Lady of her joy.  Messire Gawain goeth on
his way toward the assembly, for well knoweth he that, and King
<P>
Arthur and Lancelot have heard the tidings, there will they be.
He goeth thitherward as fast as he may, and as straight, and
scarce hath he ridden away or ever he met a squire that seemed
right weary, and his hackney sore worn of the way.  Messire
Gawain asked him whence he came, and the squire said to him.
"From the land of King Arthur, where is great war toward, for
that none knoweth not what hath become of him.  Many folk go
about saying that he is dead, for never sithence that he departed
from Cardoil, and Messire Gawain and Lancelot with him, have no
tidings been heard of him; and he left the Queen at Cardoil to
take his place, and also on account of her son's death, and the
most part say that he is dead.  Briant of the Isles and my Lord
Kay with him are burning his land, and carrying off plunder
before all the castles.  Of all the Knights of the Table Round
are there now no more than five and thirty, and of these are ten
sore wounded, and they are in Cardoil, and there protect the land
the best they may."
<P>
<P>
XXIV.
<P>
When Messire Gawain heareth these tidings, they touch his heart
right sore, so that he goeth the straightest he may toward the
assembly, and the squire with him that was sore fordone.  Messire
Gawain found King Arthur and Lancelot, and the knights were come
from all the kingdom to the piece of ground.  For a knight was
come thither that had brought a white destrier and borne thither
a right rich crown of gold, and it was known throughout all the
lands that marched with this, that the knight that should do best
at the assembly should have the destrier and the crown, for the
Queen that ware it was dead, and it would behove him to guard and
defend the land whereof she had been Lady.  On account of these
tidings had come thither great plenty of folk and of folk.  King
Arthur and Messire Gawain and Lancelot set them of one side.  The
story saith that at this assembly King Arthur bare the red shield
that the damsel gave him; Messire Gawain had his own, such as he
was wont to bear, and Lancelot a green shield that he bare for
the love of the knight that was slain for helping him in the
forest.  They struck into the assembly like lions unchained, and
cast down three knights at their first onset.  They searched the
fellowships on every side, smote down knights and overthrew
horses.
<P>
<P>
XXV.
<P>
King Arthur overtook no knight but he clave his shield to the
boss: all swerved aside and avoided his buffets.  And Messire
Gawain and Lancelot are not idle on the other hand, but each held
well his place.  But the more part had wonderment looking at the
King, for he holdeth him at bay like a lion when the staghounds
would attack him.  The assembly lasted throughout on such wise,
and when it came to an end, the knights said and adjudged that
the Knight of the Red Shield had surpassed all other in doing
well.  The knight that had brought the crown came to the King,
but knew him not a whit: "Sir," saith he, "You have by your good
deeds of arms won this crown of gold and this destrier, whereof
ought you to make great joy, so only you have so much valour in
you as that you may defend the land of the best earthly Queen
that is dead, and whether the King be alive or dead none knoweth,
wherefore great worship will it be to yourself and you may have
prowess to maintain the land, for right broad is it and right
rich and of high sovranty.
<P>
<P>
XXVI.
<P>
Saith King Arthur, "Whose was the land, and what was the name of
the Queen whose crown I see?"
<P>
"Sir, the King's name was Arthur, and the best king in the world
was he; but in his kingdom the more part say that he is dead. 
And this crown was the crown of Queen Guenievre that is dead and
buried, whereof is sore sorrow.  The knights that may not leave
Cardoil lest Briant of the Isles should seize the city, they sent
me to the kingdom of Logres and charged me with the crown and
destrier for that I have knowledge of the isles and foreign
lands; wherefore they prayed me I should go among the assemblies
of knights, that so I might hear tidings of my Lord King Arthur
and my Lord Gawain and Lancelot, and, so I might find them, that
I should tell them how the land hath fallen into this grievous
sorrow."
<P>
King Arthur heareth tidings whereof he is full sorrowful.  He
draweth on one side, and the knights make the most grievous dole
in the world.  Lancelot knoweth not what he may do, and saith
between his teeth that now hath his joy come to an end and his
knighthood is of no avail, for that he hath lost the high Queen,
the valiant, that heart and comfort gave him and encouragement to
do well.  The tears ran down from his comely eyes right amidst
his face and through the ventail, and, had he durst make other
dole, yet greater would it have been.  Of the mourning the King
made is there nought to speak, for this sorrow resembleth none
other.  He holdeth the crown of gold, and looketh full oft at the
destrier for love of her, for he had given it her; and Messire
Gawain may not stint of making dole.
<P>
<P>
XXVII.
<P>
"Certes", saith he, "Now may I well say that the best Queen in
the world and of most understanding is dead, nor never hereafter
shall be none of equal worth."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot to the King, "So it please you, and Messire
Gawain be willing, I will go back toward Cardoil, and help to
defend your land to the best I may, for sore is it discounselled,
until such time as you shall be come from the Graal."
<P>
"Certes," saith Messire Gawain to the King, "Lancelot hath spoken
well, so you grant him your consent."
<P>
"That do I with right good will," saith the Kind, "And I pray him
right heartily that he go thither and be guardian of my land and
the governance thereof, until such a time as God shall have
brought me back."
<P>
Lancelot taketh leave of the King and goeth his way back, all
sorrowing and full of discontent.
