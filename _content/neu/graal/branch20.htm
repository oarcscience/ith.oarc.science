<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XX</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
The story saith that King Arthur goeth his way and Lancelot and
Messire Gawain with him, and they had ridden so far one day that
night came on in a forest and they might find no hold.  Messire
Gawain marvelled him much that they had ridden the day long
without finding neither hold nor hermitage.  Night was come and
the sky was dark and the forest full of gloom.  They knew not
whitherward to turn to pass the night.
<P>
"Lords," saith the King, "Where may we be able to alight to-
night?"
<P>
"Sir, we know not, for this forest is fight wearisome."
<P>
They make the squire climb up a tall tree and tell him to look as
far as he may to try whether he may espy any hold or house where
they may lodge.  The squire looketh on all sides, and then
telleth them he seeth a fire a long way off as if it were in a
waste house, but that he seeth nought there save the fire and the
house.
<P>
"Take good heed," saith Lancelot, "in which quarter it is, so
that you may know well how to lead us thither."
<P>
He saith that right eath may he lead them.
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
With that he cometh down and mounteth again on his hackney, and
they go forward a great pace and ride until they espy the fire
and the hold.  They pass on over a bridge of wattles, and find
the courtyard all deserted and the house from within great and
high and hideous.  But there was a great fire within whereof the
heat might be felt from afar.  They alight of their horses, and
the squire draweth them on one side amidst the hall, and the
knights set them beside the fire all armed.  The squire seeth a
chamber in the house and entereth thereinto to see if he may find
any meat for the horses, but he cometh forth again the swiftest
he may and crieth right sweetly on the Mother of the Saviour.
They ask him what aileth him, and he saith that he hath found the
most treacherous chamber ever he found yet, for he felt there,
what with heads and what with hands, more than two hundred men
dead, and saith that never yet felt he so sore afeared.  Lancelot
went into the chamber to see whether he spake true, and felt the
men that lay dead, and groped among them from head to head and
felt that there was a great heap of them there, and came back and
sate at the fire all laughing.  The King asketh whether the 
squire had told truth.  Lancelot answereth him yea, and that
never yet had he found so many dead men together.
<P>
"Methinketh," saith Messire Gawain, "Sith that they are dead we
have nought to fear of them, but God protect us from the living."
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
While they were talking thus, behold you a damsel that cometh
into the dwelling on foot and all alone, and she cometh lamenting
right grievously.
<P>
"Ha, God!" saith she, "How long a penance is this for me, and
when will it come to an end?"
<P>
She seeth the knights sitting in the midst of the house.  "Fair
Lord God," saith she, "Is he there within through whom I am to
escape from this great dolour?"
<P>
The knights hearken to her with great wonderment.  They look and
see her enter within the door, and her kirtle was all torn with
thorns and briars in the forest.  Her feet were all bleeding for
that she was unshod.  She had a face of exceeding great beauty.
She carried the half of a dead man, and cast it into the chamber
with the others.  She knew Lancelot again so soon as she saw him. 
<P>
"Ha, God !" saith she, "I am quit of my penance!  Sir," saith
she, "Welcome may you be, you and your company!"
<P>
Lancelot looketh at her in wonderment.  "Damsel," saith he, "Are
you a thing on God's behalf?"
<P>
"Certes, Sir," saith she, "Yea!  nor be you adread of nought!  I
am the Damsel of the Castle of Beards, that was wont to deal with
knights so passing foully as you have seen.  You did away the
toll that was levied on the knights that passed by, and you lay
in the castle that demanded it of them that passed through the
demesne thereof.  But you had me in covenant that so the Holy
Graal should appear unto you, you would come back to me, for
otherwise never should I have been willing to let you go.  You
returned not, for that you saw not the Graal.  For the shame that
I did to knights was this penance laid upon me in this forest and
this manor, to last until such time as you should come.  For the
cruelty I did them was sore grievous, for never was knight
brought to me but I made his nose be cut off or his eyes thrust
out, and some were there as you saw that had their feet or their
hands stricken off.  Now have I paid full dear thereof since, for
needs must I carry into this chamber all the knights that are
slain in this forest, and within this manor must I cast them
according to the custom thereof, alone, without company; and this
knight that I carried in but now hath lain so long in the forest
that wild beasts have eaten half of his body.  Now am I quit of 
this foul penance, thanks to God and to you, save only that I
must go back when it shall be daylight in like manner as I came
here."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Right glad am I that we should have
come to lodge the night here within, for love of you, for I never
saw I damsel that might do so cruel penance."
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "You know not yet what it is, but you will know
it ere long this night, both you and your fellows, and the Lord
God shield you from death and from mischief!  Every night cometh
a rout of knights that are black and foul and hideous, albeit
none knoweth whence they come, and they do battle right sore the
one against other, and the stour endureth of a right long while;
but one knight that came within yonder by chance, the first night
I came hither, in like manner as you have come, made a circle
round me with his sword, and I sate within it as soon as I saw
them coming, and so had I no dread of them, for I had in
remembrance the Saviour of the World and His passing sweet
Mother.  And you will do the same, and you believe me herein, for
these are knights fiends."
<P>
Lancelot draweth his sword and maketh a great circle round the
house-place, and they were within.
<P>
<P>
V.
<P>
Thereupon, behold you the knights that come through the forest
with such a rushing as it seemed they would rend it all up by the
roots.  Afterward, they enter into the manor and snatch great
blazing firebrands and fling them one at another.  They enter
into the house battling together, and are keen to fall upon the
knights, but they may not.  They hurl the firebrands at them from
afar, but they are holding their shields and their swords naked.
Lancelot maketh semblant as though he would leap towards them,
and sore great cowardize it seemeth him nor to go against them. 
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "Take heed that you go not forth of the
circle, for you will be in sore jeopardy of death, for well you
see what evil folk be these."
<P>
Lancelot was nor minded to hold himself back, but that he would
go toward them sword drawn, and they run upon him on all sides,
but he defendeth him stoutly and smiteth the burning firebrands
so that he maketh red-hot charcoal fly, and thrusreth his sword
amidst their faces.  King Arthur and Messire Gawain leap up to
help Lancelot and smite upon these evil folk and cut them limb
from limb, and they bellow like fiends so that the whole forest
resoundeth thereof.  And when they fell to the ground, they may
no longer endure, but become fiends and ashes, and their bodies
and their horses become devils all black in the shape of ravens
that come forth of their bodies.  They marvel right sore what
this may be, and say that such hostel is right grievous.
<P>
<P>
VI.
<P>
When they had put them all to the worse, they sate them down
again and rested; but scarce were they seated or ever another
rout of yet blacker folk came about them, and they bare spears
burning and flaming, and many of them carried dead knights that
they had slain in the forest, and dropped them in the midst of
the house, and then bid the damsel carry and set them with the
others.  Howbeit, she answereth that she is quit of their
commandment and service, nor no longer is forced to do nought for
them sith that she hath done her penance.  They thrust forward
their spears toward the King and the two knights, as though they
were come to avenge their companions; but they all three leapt up
together and attacked them right stoutly.  But this rout was
greater and of knights more hideous.  They began to press the
King and his knights hard, and they might not put them to the
worse as they did the others.  And while they were thus in the
thickest of the conflict, they heard the stroke of a bell
sounding, and forthwith the knight fiends departed and hurried
away a great pace.
<P>
"Lords," saith the damsel, "Had this sound not been heard, scarce
might you have endured, for yet another huge rout of this folk
was coming in such sort as that none might have withstood them,
and this sound have I heard every night, whereby my life hath
been saved."
<P>
<P>
VII.
<P>
Josephus telleth us that as at this time was there no bell
neither in Greater Britain nor in Lesser; but folk were called
together by a horn, and in many places there were sheets of
steel, and in other places clappers of wood.  King Arthur
marvelled him much of this sound, so clear and sweet was it, and
it well seemed him that it came on God's behalf, and right fain
was he to see a bell and so he might.  They were the night until
the morrow in the house, as I tell you.  The damsel took leave of
them and so departed.  As they came forth of the hold, they met
three hermits that told them they were going to search for the
bodies that were in this manor so that they might bury them in a
waste chapel that was hard by, for such knights had lain there as
that henceforward the haunting of the evil folk would be stayed
in such sort as that they would have no more power to do hurt to
any, wherefore they would set therewithin a worshipful hermit
that should build up the place in holiness for the service of
God.  The King was right joyful thereof, and told them that it
had been too perilous.  They parted from the hermits and entered
into a forest, nor was there never a day so long as King Arthur
was on pilgrimage, so saith the history, but he heard the sound
of one single bell every hour, whereof he was right glad.  He
bade Messire Gawain and Lancelot that they should everywhere
conceal his name, and that they should call him not Lord but
Comrade.  They yielded him his will, and prayed to Our Lord that
he would guide and lead them to such a castle and such a hostel
as that they might be lodged honourably therein.  They rode on
until evening drew nigh, and they found a right fair hold in the
forest, whereinto they entered and alighted.  The damsel of the
hold came to meet them and made them right great cheer, then made
them be disarmed, afterward bringeth them right rich robes to
wear.  She looketh at Lancelot and knoweth him again.
<P>
<P>
VIII.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "You had once, on a day that is past, right
great pity of me, and saved me my honour, whereof am I in great
unhappiness.  But better love I to suffer misease in honour, than
to have plenty and abundance in shame or reproach, for shame
endureth, but sorrow is soon overpassed."
<P>
Thereupon behold you the knight of the hold, whither he cometh
from shooting in the forest and maketh carry in full great plenty
venison of deer and wild boar.  He alighted to greet the knights,
and began to laugh when he saw Lancelot.
<P>
"By my head," saith he, "I know you well For you disappointed me
of the thing I best loved in the world, and made me marry this
damsel that never yet had joy of me, nor never shall have."
<P>
"Faith, Sir," saith Lancelot, "You will do your pleasure therein,
for she is yours.  Truth it is that I made you marry her, for you
were fain to do her a disgrace and a shame in such sort that her
kinsfolk would have had shame of her."
<P>
"By my head," saith the knight, "the damsel that I loved before
loveth you no better hereof, nay, rather, fain would she procure
your vexation and your hurt and your shame if she may, and great
power hath she in this forest."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "I have sithence spoken to her and she to
me, and so hath she told me her will and her wish."
<P>
Thereupon the knight bade the knights take water, and the lady
taketh the basins and presenteth water to the knights.
<P>
"Avoid, damsel," saith the King, "Take it away!  Never, please
God, shall it befall that we should accept such service from
you."
<P>
"By my head," saith the knight, "But so must you needs do, for
other than she shall not serve you to-night in this matter, or
otherwise shall you not eat with me this night there within."
<P>
<P>
IX.
<P>
Lancelot understandeth that the knight is not overburdened of
courtesy, and he seeth the table garnished of good meat, and
bethinketh him he will not do well to lose such ease, for misease
enough had they the night before.  He maketh the King take water
of the lady, and the same service did she for all of them.  The
knight biddeth them be seated.  The King would have made the lady
sit beside him at the table, but the knight said that there she
should not sit.  She goeth to sit among the squires as she was
wont to do.  The knights are sorry enough thereof, but they durst
not gainsay the will of her lord.  When they had eaten, the
knight said to Lancelot, "Now may you see what she hath gained of
me by your making me take her perforce, nor never, so help me
God, so long as I live shall she be honoured otherwise by me, for
so have I promised her that I love far more."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "To my thinking you do ill herein and a
sin, and meseemeth you should have great blame thereof of them
that know it, and may your churlishness be your own, for nought
thereof take I to myself."
<P>
<P>
X.
<P>
Lancelot telleth the King and Messire Gawain that were he not
lodged in his hostel, and had him outside of the hold, he would
willingly have set the blood of his body on it but he would have
handled him in such sort as that the lady should be maintained in
greater honour, either by force or by prayer, in like manner as
he did when he made him marry her.  They were right well lodged
the night and lay in the hold until the morrow, when they
departed thence, and rode right busily on their journeys until
they came into a very different land, scarce inhabited of any
folk, and found a little castle in a combe.  They came
thitherward and saw that the enclosure of the castle was fallen
down into an abysm, so that none might approach it on that side,
but it had a right fair gateway and a door tall and wide whereby
one entered.  They beheld a chapel that was right fair and rich,
and below was a great ancient hall.  They saw a priest appear in
the midst of the castle, bald and old, that had come forth of the
chapel.  They are come thither and alighted, and asked the priest
what the castle was, and he told them that it was the great
Tintagel.
<P>
"And how is this ground all caved in about the castle?"
<P>
"Sir," saith the priest, "I will tell you.  Sir," saith he, "King
Uther Pendragon, that was father of King Arthur, held a great
court and summoned all his barons.  The King of this castle that
then was here was named Gorlois.  He went to the court and took
his wife with him, that was named Ygerne, and she was the fairest
dame in any kingdom.  King Uther sought acquaintance of her for
her great beauty, and regarded her and honoured her more than all
the others of his court.  King Gorlois departed thence and made
the Queen come back to this castle for the dread that he had of
King Uther Pendragon.  King Uther was very wroth with him, and
commanded him to send back the Queen his wife.  King Godois said
that he would not.  Thereupon King Uther Pendragon defied him,
and then laid siege about this castle where the Queen was.  King
Gorlois was gone to seek for succour.  King Uther Pendragon had
Merlin with him of whom you have heard tell, that was so crafty.
He made him be changed into the semblance of King Gorlois, so
that he entered there within by Merlin's art and lay that night
with the Queen, and so begat King Arthur in a great hall that was
next to the enclosure there where this abysm is.  And for this
sin hath the ground sunken in on this wise."
<P>
He cometh with them toward the chapel that was right fair, and
had a right rich sepulchre therein.
<P>
"Lords, in this sepulchre was placed the body of Merlin, but
never mought it be set inside the chapel, wherefore perforce it
remained outside.  And know of a very truth that the body lieth
not within the sepulchre, for, so soon as it was set therein, it
was taken out and snatched away, either on God's behalf or the
Enemy's, but which we know not."
<P>
<P>
XI.
<P>
"Sir," saith King Arthur, "And what became of King Gorlois?"
<P>
"Sir." saith he, "The King slew him on the morrow of the night he
lay with his wife, and so forthwith espoused Queen Ygerne, and in
such manner as I tell you was King Arthur conceived in sin that
is now the best King in the world."
<P>
King Arthur hath heard this as concerning his birth that he knew
not, and is a little shamed thereof and confounded on account of
Messire Gawain and Lancelot.  He himself marvelleth much thereof,
and much it misliketh him that the priest hath said so much. They
lay the night in the hold, and so departed thence on the morrow
when they had heard mass.  Lancelot and Messire Gawain, that
thought they knew the forest, found the land so changed and
different that they knew not whither they were become, and such
an one as should come into the land that had been King
Fisherman's, and he should come again another time within forty
days, should not find the castle within a year.
<P>
<P>
XII.
<P>
Josephus telleth us that the semblances of the islands changed
themselves by reason of the divers adventures that by the
pleasure of God befell therein, and that the quest of adventures
would not have pleased the knights so well and they had not found
them so different.  For, when they had entered into a forest or
an island where they had found any adventure, and they came there
another time, they found holds and castles and adventures of
another kind, so that their toils and travails might not weary
them, and also for that God would that the land should be
conformed to the New Law.  And they were the knights that had
more toil and travail in seeking adventures than all the knights
of the world before them, and in holding to that whereof they had
made covenant; nor of no court of no king in the world went forth
so many good knights as went forth from the court of King Arthur,
and but that God loved them so much, never might they have
endured such toil and travail as they did from day to day; for
without fait, good knights were they, and good knights not only
to deal hard buffets, but rather in that they were loyal and
true, and had faith in the Saviour of the World and His sweet
Mother, and therefore dreaded shame and loved honour.  King
Arthur goeth on his way and Messire Gawain and Lancelot with him,
and they pass through many strange countries, and so enter into a
great forest.  Lancelot called to remembrance the knight that he
had slain in the Waste City whither behoved him to go, and knew
well that the day whereon he should come was drawing nigh.  He
told King Arthur as much, and then said, that and he should go
not, he would belie his covenant.  They rode until they came to a
cross where the ways forked.
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "Behoveth me go to acquit me of my pledge,
and I go in great adventure and peril of death, nor know I
whether I may live at all thereafter, for I slew the knight,
albeit I was right sorry thereof, but or ever I slew him, I had
to swear that I would go set my head in the like jeopardy as he
had set his.  Now the day draweth nigh that I must go thither,
for I am unwilling to fail of my covenant, whereof I should be
blamed, and, so God grant me to escape therefrom, I will follow
you speedily."
<P>
The King embraceth him and kisseth him at parting and Messire
Gawain also, and they pray God preserve his body and his life,
and that they may see him again ere it be long.  Lancelot would
willingly have sent salute to the Queen had he durst, for she lay
nearer his heart than aught beside, but he would not that the
King nor Messire Gawain should misdeem of the love they might
carry to their kinswoman.  The love is so rooted in his heart
that he may not leave it, into what peril soever he may go;
rather, he prayeth God every day as sweetly as he may, that He
save the Queen, and that he may deliver his body from this
jeopardy.  He hath ridden until that he cometh at the hour of
noon into the Waste City, and findeth the city empty as it was
the first time he was there.
<P>
<P>
XIII.
<P>
In the city wherein Lancelot had arrived were many waste houses
and rich palaces fallen down.  He had scarce entered within the
city when he heard a great cry and lamentation of dames and
damsels, but he knew not on which side it was, and they say: "Ha,
God, how hath the knight betrayed us that slew the knight,
inasmuch as he returneth not!  This day is the day come that he
ought to redeem his pledge!  Never again ought any to put trust
in knight, for that he cometh not!  The others that came hither
before him have failed us, and so will he also for dread of
death; for he smote off the head of the comeliest knight that was
in this kingdom and the best, wherefore ought he also to have his
own smitten off, but good heed taketh he to save it if he may!"
<P>
Thus spake the damsels.  Lancelot much marvelled where they might
be, for nought could he espy of them, albeit he cometh before the
palace, there where he slew the knight.  He alighteth, then
maketh fast his horse's reins to a ring that was fixed in the
mounting-stage of marble.  Scarce hath he done so, when a knight
alighteth, tall and comely and strong and deliver, and he was
clad in a short close-fitted jerkin of silk, and held the axe in
his hand wherewith Lancelot had smitten off the head of the other
knight, and he came sharpening it on a whetstone to cut the
better.  Lancelot asketh him, "What will you do with this axe?"
<P>
"By my head," saith the knight, "That shall you know in such sort
as my brother knew when you cut off his head, so I may speed of
my business."
<P>
"How?" saith Lancelot, "Will you slay me then?"
<P>
"That shall you know," saith he, "or ever you depart hence.  Have
you not loyally promised hereof that you would set your head in
the same jeopardy as the knight set his, whom you slew without
defence?  And no otherwise may you depart therefrom.  Wherefore
now come forward without delay and kneel down and stretch your
neck even as my brother did, and so will I smite off your head,
and, if you do nor this of your own good will, you shall soon
find one that shall make you do it perforce, were you twenty
knights as good as you are one.  But well I know that you have
not come hither for this, but only to fulfil your pledge, and
that you will raise no contention herein."
<P>
Lancelot thinketh to die, and is minded to abide by that he hath
in covenant without fail, wherefore he lieth down on the ground
as it were on a cross, and crieth mercy of God.  He mindeth him
of the Queen, and crieth God of mercy and saith, "Ha, Lady" saith
he, "Never shall I see you more!  but, might I have seen you yet
once again before I die, exceeding great comfort had it been to
me, and my soul would have departed from me more at ease.  But
this, that never shall I see you more, as now it seemeth me,
troubleth me more than the death whereby behoveth me to die, for
die one must when one hath lived long enough.  But faithfully do
I promise you that my love shall fail you not yet, and never
shall it be but that my soul shall love you in the other world
like as my body hath loved you in this, if thus the soul may
love!"
<P>
With that the tears fell from his eyes, nor, never sithence that
he was knight, saith the story, had he wept for nought that had
befallen him nor for heaviness of heart, but this time and one
other.  He taketh three blades of grass and so eateth thereof in
token of the holy communion, then signeth him of the cross and
blesseth him, riseth up, setteth himself on his knees and
stretcheth forth his neck.  The knight lifteth up the axe.
Lancelot heareth the blow coming, boweth his head and the axe
misseth him.  He saith to him, "Sir Knight, so did not my brother
that you slew; rather, he held his head and neck quite still, and
so behoveth you to do!"
<P>
Two damsels appeared at the palace-windows of passing great
beauty, and they knew Lancelot well.  So, as the knight was
aiming a second blow, one of the damsels crieth to him, "And you
would have my love for evermore, throw down the axe and cry the
knight quit!  Otherwise have you lost me for ever!"
<P>
The knight forthwith flingeth down the axe and falleth at
Lancelot's feet and crieth mercy of him as of the most loyal
knight in the world.
<P>
"But you?  Have mercy on me, you!  and slay me not!" saith
Lancelot, "For it is of you that I ought to pray mercy!"
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "Of a surety will I not do this!  Rather
will I help you to my power to save your life against all men,
for all you have slain my brother."
<P>
The damsels come down from the palace and are come to Lancelot.
<P>
<P>
XIV.
<P>
"Sir," say they to Lancelot, "Greatly ought we to love you, yea,
better than all knights in the world beside.  For we are the two
damsels, sisters, that you saw so poor at the Waste Castle where
you lay in our brother's house.  You and Messire Gawain and
another knight gave us the treasure and the hold of the robber-
knights that you slew; for this city which is waste and the Waste
Castle of my brother would never again be peopled of folk, nor
should we never have had the land again, save a knight had come
hither as loyal as are you.  Full a score knights have arrived
here by chance in the same manner as you came, and not one of
them but hath slain a brother or a kinsman and cut off his head
as you did to the knight, and each one promised to return at the
day appointed; but all failed of their covenant, for not one of
them durst come to the day; and so you had failed us in like
manner as the others, we should have lost this city without
recovery and the castles that are its appanages."
<P>
<P>
XV.
<P>
So the knight and the damsels lead Lancelot into the palace and
then make him be disarmed.  They hear presently how the greatest
joy in the world is being made in many parts of the forest, that
was nigh the city.
<P>
"Sir," say the damsels, "Now may you hear the joy that is made of
your coming.  These are the burgesses and dwellers in the city
that already know the tidings."
<P>
Lancelot leaneth at the windows of the hall, and seeth the city
peopled of the fairest folk in the world, and great thronging in
the broad streets and the great palace, and clerks and priests
coming in long procession praising God and blessing Him for that
they may now return to their church, and giving benison to the
knight through whom they are free to repair thither.  Lancelot
was much honoured throughout the city.  The two damsels are at
great pains to wait upon him, and right great worship had he of
all them that were therewithin and them that came thither, both
clerks and priests.
