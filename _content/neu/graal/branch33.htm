<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXXIII</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
Afterward, this title telleth us that Meliot of Logres was
departed from Castle Perilous sound and whole, by virtue of the
sword that Lancelot had brought him, and of the cloth that he
took in the Chapel Perilous.  But sore sorrowful was he of the
tidings he had heard that Messire Gawain was in prison and he
knew not where, but he had been borne on hand that two knights
that were kinsmen of them of the Raving Castle that had slain one
another, had shut him in prison on account of Perceval that had
won the castle.  Now, saith Meliot of Logres, never shall he have
ease again until he knoweth where Messire Gawain is.  He rideth
amidst a forest, and prayeth God grant him betimes to hear
witting of Messire Gawain.  The forest was strange and gloomy. 
He rode until nightfall but might not find neither hold nor
hermitage.  He looketh right amidst the forest before him and
seeth a damsel sitting that bemoaneth herself full sore.  The
moon was dark and the place right foul of seeming and the forest
gloomy of shadow.
<P>
"Ha, damsel, and what do you here at this hour?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "I may not amend it, the more is my sorrow. 
For the place is more perilous than you think.  Look," saith she,
"up above, and you will see the occasion wherefore I am here."
<P>
Meliot looketh and seeth two knights all armed hanging up above
the damsel's head.  Thereof much marvelleth he.
<P>
"Ha, damsel," saith he, "Who slew these knights so foully?"
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "The Knight of the Galley that singeth in the
sea."
<P>
"And wherefore hath he hanged them in such wise?"
<P>
"For this," saith she, "that they believed in God and His sweet
Mother.  And so behoveth me to watch them here for forty days,
that none take them down of hanging, for and they were taken
hence he would lose his castle, he saith, and would cut off my
head."
<P>
"By my head," saith Meliot, "Such watch is foul shame to damsel,
and no longer shall you remain here."
<P>
"Ha, Sir," saith the damsel, "Then shall I be a dead woman, for
he is of so great cruelty that none scarce might protect me
against him."
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
"Damsel," saith Meliot, "Foul shame would it be and I left here
these knights in such wise for the reproach of other knights."
<P>
Meliot made them graves with his sword, and so buried them the
best he might.
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "And you take not thought to protect me,
the knight will slay me.  To-morrow, when he findeth not the
knights, he will search all the forest to look for me."
<P>
Meliot and the damsel together go their way through the forest
until they come to a chapel where was wont to be a hermit that
the Knight of the Galley had destroyed.  He helpeth down the
damsel of his horse, and afterward they entered into the chapel,
where was a great brightness of light, and a damsel was there
that kept watch over a dead knight.  Meliot marvelleth him much. 
<P>
"Damsel," said Meliot, "When was this knight killed?"
<P>
"Sir, yesterday the Knight of the Galley slew him on the sea-
shore, wherefore behoveth me thus keep watch, and in the morning
will he come hither or ever he go to the castle where Messire
Gawain hath to-morrow to fight with a lion, all unarmed, and my
Lady, that is mistress both of me and of this damsel you have
brought hither, will likewise be brought to-morrow to the place
where the lion is to slay Messire Gawain, and she in like sort
will be afterward delivered to the lion and she renounce not the
New Law wherein the knight that came from Raving Castle, whereof
she is lady, hath made her believe; and we ourselves shall be in
like manner devoured along with her.  But this damsel would still
have taken respite of my death and she had still kept guard over
the knights that were so foully hanged above her.  Natheless,
sith that you have taken them down from where they were hanging,
you have done a right good deed, whatsoever betide, for the Lord
of the Red Tower will give his castle to the knight for this." 
<P>
Meliot is right joyous of the tidings that he hath heard of
Messire Gawain that he is still on live, for well knoweth he,
sith that the Knight of the Galley will come by the chapel there,
that he will come thither or ever Messire Gawain doth battle with
the lion.
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel of the chapel, "For God's sake, take this
damsel to a place of safety, for the knight will be so wood mad
of wrath and despite so soon as he cometh hither, that he will be
fain to smite off her head forthwith, and of yourself also have I
great fear."
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
"Damsel," saith Meliot, "The knight is but a man like as am I."
<P>
"Yea, Sir, but stronger is he and more cruel than seem you to
be."
<P>
Meliot was in the chapel the night until the morrow, and heard
the knight coming like a tempest, and he brought with him the
lady of the castle and reviled her from time to time, and Meliot
seeth him come, and a dwarf that followeth after him a great
pace.  He crieth out to him: "Sir, behold there the disloyal
knight through whom you have lost your castle.  Now haste! 
Avenge yourself of him!  After that will we go to the death of
Messire Gawain?"
<P>
Meliot, so soon as he espieth him, mounteth and maketh his arms
ready.
<P>
"Is it you," saith the Knight of the Galley, "that hath
trespassed on my demesne and taken down my knights?"
<P>
"By my head, yours were they not!  Rather were they the knights
of God, and foul outrage have you done herein when you slew them
so shamefully."
<P>
He goeth toward the knight without more words, and smiteth him so
passing strong amidst the breast that he pierceth the habergeon
and thrusteth all the iron of his spear into his body and
afterward draweth it back to him with a great wrench.  And the
knight smiteth him so hard on his shield that he maketh an ell's
length pass beyond, for right wroth was he that he was wounded.
The dwarf crieth to him, "Away, then!  The knight endureth
against you that have slain so many of them!"
<P>
The Knight of the Galley waxeth wood wrath.  He taketh his
career, and cometh as fast as his horse may carry him, and
smiteth Meliot so strongly that he breaketh his spear in such
sort that he maketh both him and his horse stagger.  But Meliot
catcheth him better, for he thrusteth the spear right through his
body and hurleth against him at the by-passing with such
stoutness and force that he maketh him fall dead to the ground
from his horse.  The dwarf thought to escape, but Meliot smote
off his head, whereof the damsels gave him great thanks, for many
a mischief had he wrought them.
<P>
<P>
IV.
<P>
Meliot buried the knight that he found in the chapel dead, then
told the damsels that he might abide no longer, but would go
succour Messire Gawain and he might.  The damsels were horsed to
their will, for one had the horse of the knight that was slain
and the other the horse of the dwarf.  The other damsel was come
upon a mule, and they said that they would go back, for the
country was made all safe by the death of the knight.  They
thanked Meliot much, for they say truly that he hath rescued them
from death.  Meliot departeth from the damsels and goeth right
amidst the forest as he that would most fain hear tidings of
Messire Gawain.  When he had ridden of a long space, he met a
knight that was coming all armed at great pace.
<P>
"Sir Knight," saith he to Meliot, "Can you tell me tidings of the
Knight of the Galley?"
<P>
"What have you to do therein?" saith Meliot.
<P>
"Sir, the Lord of the Red Tower hath made bring Messire Gawain
into a launde of this forest, and there, all unarmed, must he do
battle with a lion.  So my lord is waiting for the Knight of the
Galley, that is to bring two damsels thither that the lion will
devour when he shall have slain Messire Gawain."
<P>
"Will the battle be presently?" saith Meliot.
<P>
"Yea, Sir," saith the knight, "Soon enough betimes, for Messire
Gawain hath already been led thither and there bound to a stake
until such time as the lion shall be come.  Then will he be
unbound, but even then two knights all armed will keep watch on
him.  But tell me tidings of the Knight of the Galley, and you
have seen him?"
<P>
"Go forward," saith he, "and you will hear tidings of him." 
<P>
Meliot departeth thereupon, a great gallop, and cometh nigh the
launde whereunto Messire Gawain had been brought.  He espied the
two knights that kept guard over him, and if that Messire Gawain
were in fear, little marvel was it, for he thought that his end
had come.  Meliot espied him bound to an iron staple with cords
about the body on all sides so that he might not move.  Meliot
hath great pity thereof in his heart, and saith to himself that
he will die there sooner than Messire Gawain shall die.  He
clappeth spurs to his horse when he cometh nigh the knights, and
overtaketh one of them with such a rush that he thrusteth his
spear right through his body, and beareth him down dead.  The
other was fain to go to the castle for succour when he saw his
fellow dead.  Meliot slew him forthwith.  He cometh to Messire
Gawain, and so unbindeth him and cutteth the cords wherewith he
is bound.
<P>
"Sir," saith he, "I am Meliot of Logres, your knight."
<P>
<P>
V.
<P>
When Messire Gawain felt himself unbound, no need to ask whether
he had joy thereof.  The tidings were come to the Red Court that
Queen Jandree was christened and baptized, and that the Knight
was come that had such force and puissance in him that none might
endure against him for the God in whom he believed, and they knew
likewise that the Knight of the Galley was dead, and Messire
Gawain unbound and the knights that guarded him slain.  They say
that there may they not abide, so they depart from the castle and
say that they will cross the sea to protect their bodies, for
that there they may have no safety.
<P>
<P>
VI.
<P>
When Meliot had delivered Messire Gawain he made him be armed
with the arms, such as they were, of one of the knights he had
slain.  Messire Gawain mounted on a horse such as pleased him,
and right great joy had he at heart.  They marvel much how it is
that they of the castle have not come after them, but they know
not their thought nor how they are scared.
<P>
"Meliot," saith Messire Gawain, "You have delivered me from death
this time and one other, nor never had I acquaintance with any
knight that hath done so much for me in so short a time as have
you."
<P>
They departed the speediest they might and rode nigh enow to the
castle, but they heard none moving within nor any noise, nor saw
they none issue forth, and much marvelled they that none should
come after them.  They rode until they came to the head of the
forest and caught sight of the sea that was nigh enough before
them, and saw that there was a great clashing of arms at the
brink of the sea.  A single knight was doing battle with all them
that would fain have entered into a ship, and held stour so
stiffly against them that he toppled the more part into the sea.
They went thither as fast as they might, and when they drew nigh
to the ship they knew that it was Perceval by his arms and his
shield.  Or ever they reached it, the ship was put off into the
midst of the sea, wherein he was launched of his own great
hardiment, and they went on fighting against him within the ship. 
<P>
"Meliot," saith Messire Gawain, "See you, there is Perceval the
Good Knight, and now may we say of a truth that he is in sore
peril of death; for that ship, save God bethink Him thereof,
shall arrive in such manner and in such a place as that never
more shall we have no witting of him, and, so he perish for ever,
no knight on live may have power to set forward the Law of our
Lord."
<P>
<P>
VII.
<P>
Messire Gawain seeth the ship going further away, and Perceval
that defendeth himself therein against them that set upon him.
Right heavy is he that he came not sooner, or ever the ship had
put off from the land.  He turneth back, he and Meliot together,
and right sorrowful was Messire Gawain of Perceval, for they knew
not in what land he might arrive, and, might he have followed,
right gladly would he have gone after him to aid him.  They have
ridden until they meet a knight.  Messire Gawain asketh him
whence he cometh, and he saith from King Arthur's court.
<P>
"What tidings can you tell us thereof?" saith Messire Gawain. 
<P>
"Sir, bad enough!" saith he.  "King Arthur hath neglected all his
knights for Briant of the Isles, and hath put one of his best
knights in prison."
<P>
"What is his name?" saith Messire Gawain.
<P>
"Sir, he is called Lancelot of the Lake.  He had reconquered all
the islands that had been reft of King Arthur, and slain King
Madeglant, and conquered the land of Oriande that he turned to
the belief of the Saviour of the World, and, so soon as he had
conquered his enemies, King Arthur sent for him forthwith and
straightway put him in his prison by the counsel of Briant of the
Isles.  But King Arthur will have a surfeit of friends betimes;
for King Claudas hath assembled his folk in great plenty to
reconquer the kingdom of Oriande and come back upon King Arthur
by the counsel of Briant of the Isles that betrayeth the King,
for he hath made him his Seneschal and commander of all his
land."
<P>
"Sir Knight," saith Messire Gawain, "Needs must the King miscarry
that setteth aside the counsel of his good knights for the
leasings of a traitor."
<P>
Thereupon the knight departed from Messire Gawain.  Right heavy
is he of this that he hath said, that the King hath put Lancelot
in prison.  Never tofore did he aught whereby he wrought so much
to blame.
