<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXIV</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
Here the story is silent of the kingdom, and of King Arthur and
Messire Gawain that remain in the castle to maintain and guard it
until they shall have garnished it of folk.  Here speaketh it
word of the knight's son of the Waste Manor, there whither the
brachet led Messire Gawain where he found the knight that
Lancelot had slain.  He had one son whose name was Meliant, and
he had not forgotten his father's death; rather, thereof did
wrath rankle in his heart.  He heard tell that Briant of the
Isles had great force and great puissance, and that he warred
upon King Arthur's land, insomuch as that he had already slain
many of his knights.  Thitherward goeth he, and is come to where
Briant was in a castle of his own.  He telleth him how Lancelot
had slain his father in such sort, and prayeth him right
courteously that he would make him knight, for that right fain
would he avenge his father, and therefore would he help him in
the war the best he might.  Briant made much joy thereof, and
made him knight in right costly sort, and he was the comeliest
knight and the most valiant of his age in Briant's court, and
greatly did he desire to meet with Lancelot.  They marvelled much
in the land and kingdom what had become of him.  The more part
thought that he was dead, albeit dead he was not, but rather
sound and hale and whole, had it not been for the death of Queen
Guenievre, whereof the sorrow so lay at his heart that he might
not forget it.  He rode one day amidst a forest, and overtook a
knight and a damsel that made great joy together, singing and
making disport.
<P>
"By God," saith the damsel, "If this knight that cometh here will
remain, he shall have right good lodging.  It is already nigh
eventide, and never will he find hostel so good to-day."
<P>
"Damsel." saith Lancelot, "Of good hostel have I sore need, for I
am more than enough weary."
<P>
"So be all they," saith she, "that come from the land of the rich
King Fisherman, for none may suffer the pain and travail and he
be not good knight."
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
"Ah, damsel," saith Lancelot, "Which is the way to the castle
whereof you speak?"
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "You will go by this cross that you see
before you, and we will go by that other way, to a certain hold.
Haply we shall find you at the castle or ever you depart thence."
<P>
Lancelot goeth his way and leaveth them.
<P>
"By my head," saith the damsel to the knight, "This that goeth
there is Lancelot.  He knoweth me not, albeit I know him well,
and I hear that he is sore troubled of his sorrow and mis-ease.
Natheless, please God, I will have vengeance of him or ever he
departeth from the castle whither he goeth to harbour.  He made
marry perforce a knight that loved me better than aught beside,
and to a damsel that he loved not a whit.  And so much might he
still better perceive when he saw that she ate not at his table,
but was seated along with the squires, and that none did aught
for her at the castle.  But the knight will not abandon her for
his own honour, and for that I should be blamed thereof."
<P>
The evening draweth on and Lancelot goeth toward the castle, that
was right uneath to find and in an unfrequented part.  He espieth
it at the head of the forest, and seeth that it is large and
strong, with strong barbicans embattelled, and at the entrance of
the gateway were fifteen heads of knights hanging.  He found
without a knight that came from the forest, and asked him what
castle it was, and he made answer that it was called the Castle
of the Griffon.
<P>
"And why are these heads hanging at this door?"
<P>
"Sir," saith he, "The daughter of the lord of the castle is the
fairest in the world and that is known in any kingdom, and needs
must she be offered to wife to all knights that harbour within.
He that can draw a sword that is fixed in a column in the midst
of the hall, and fetch it forth, he shall have her of right
without forfeit."
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
"All these have made assay whose heads you see hanging at the
door, but never might none of them remove the sword, and on this
occasion were they beheaded.  Now is it said that none may draw
it forth, unless he that draweth be better knight than another,
and needs must he be one of them that have been at the Graal.
But, and you be minded to believe me, fair Sir," saith the
knight, "You will go elsewhither, for ill lodging is it in a
place where one must needs set body and life in adventure of
death, and none ought to be blamed for escaping from his own
harm.  Sir, the castle is right fell, for it hath underground, at
the issue of a cavern that is there, a lion and a griffon that
have devoured more than half a hundred knights."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "It is evening, nor know I how I may go
farther this day, for I know not whither I go sith that I know
not the places nor the ways of the forest."
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "I speak only for your own good, and God
grant you depart hence, honour safe."
<P>
Lancelot findeth the door of the castle all open, and entereth in
all armed, and alighteth before the master-hall.  The King was
leaning at the windows, and biddeth stall his horse.
<P>
<P>
IV.
<P>
Lancelot is entered into the hall, and findeth knights and
damsels at the tables and playing at the chess, but none did he
find to salute him nor make him cheer of his coming save the lord
only, for such was the custom of the castle.  The lord bade him
be disarmed.
<P>
"Sir," saith he, "Right well may you allow me wear my arms, for
they be the fairest garniture and the richest I have."
<P>
"Sir," saith the lord of the castle, "No knight eateth armed
within yonder, but he that cometh armed in hither disarmeth
himself by my leave.  He may take his arms again without gainsay,
so neither I nor other desire to do him a hurt."
<P>
With that two squires disarm him.  The lord of the Castle maketh
bring a right rich robe wherein to apparel him.  The tables were
set and the meats served.  The damsel issued forth of her chamber
and was accompanied of two knights as far as the hall.  She
looketh at Lancelot, and seeth that he is a right comely knight,
and much liketh her of his bearing and countenance, and she
thinketh to herself that sore pity would it be so comely knight
should have his head smitten off.
<P>
<P>
V.
<P>
Lancelot saluted the damsel and made great cheer, and when they
had eaten in hall, forthwith behold you, the damsel where she
cometh that Lancelot overtook in the forest with the knight.
<P>
"Sir," saith she to the lord of the castle, "You have harboured
this night your deadly enemy that slew your brother at the Waste
Manor."
<P>
"By my faith," saith the lord of the manor, "I think not so, for
him would I not have harboured, nor will I not believe it for
true until such time as I have proved it. Sir," saith he to
Lancelot, "Make the demand that the others make!"
<P>
"What is it?" saith Lancelot.
<P>
"See there my daughter!  Ask her of me, and if you be such as you
ought to be, I will give her to you."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "No knight is there in the world so good
but ought to plume him upon having her to wife, so always she
were willing, and, so I thought that you would be willing to give
her to me, I would willingly ask you."
<P>
Lancelot spake otherwise than as he thought, for the departing of
the Queen and the sorrow thereof lay so at his heart that never
again might he lean upon any love in the world, neither of dame
nor damsel.  He asked his daughter of the knight of the castle,
and came before him to save the custom so that he might not have
blame thereof.  And he showed him the sword that is in the
column, all inlaid with gold.
<P>
"Go," saith he, "and fulfil the custom, as other knights have
done."
<P>
"What is it?" saith Lancelot.
<P>
"They might not draw forth the sword from this column, and so
failed of my daughter and of their lives."
<P>
"Lord God," saith Lancelot, "Defend me from this custom!"
<P>
And he cometh toward the column as fast as he may, and seizeth
the sword with both hands.  So soon as he touched it, the sword
draweth it forth with such a wrench that the column quaked
thereof.  The damsel was right joyful thereat, albeit she
misdoubted the fellness and cruelty of her father, for never yet
had she seen knight that pleased her so much to love as he.
<P>
"Sir," saith the other damsel, "I tell you plainly, this is
Lancelot, the outrageous, that slew your brother.  Natheless, is
it no lie that he is one of the best knights of the world, albeit
by the stoutness of his knighthood and his valour many an outrage
hath he done, and more shall he yet do and he escape you, and, so
you will believe me, you will never allow him to depart thus;
sith that and you kill him or slay him you will save the life of
many a knight."
<P>
The daughter of the lord of the castle is sore displeased of the
damsel for this that she saith, and looketh at Lancelot from time
to time and sigheth, but more durst she not do.  Much marvelleth
she, sith that Lancelot hath drawn the sword forth of the column,
that he asketh her not of her father as his own liege woman, but
he was thinking of another thing, and never was he so sorrowful
of any lady as he was for the Queen.  But whatsoever thought or
desire he may have therein, he telleth the lord of the castle
that he holdeth him to his covenant made at such time as the
sword was still fixed in the column.
<P>
"I have a right not to hold thereto," saith the lord of the
castle, "Nor shall I break not my vow and I fail you herein; for
no man is bound to give his daughter to his mortal enemy.  Sith
that you have slain my brother, you are my mortal enemy, and were
I to give her to you, she ought not to wish it, and were she to
grant you her love she would be a fool and a madwoman."
<P>
Right sorrowful is the damsel or this that she heareth her father
say.  She would fain that Lancelot and she were in the forest,
right in the depth thereof.  But Lancelot had no mind to be as
she was thinking.  The lord of the castle made guard the gateway
of the castle well, in such sort that Lancelot might issue
therefrom on no side.  Afterward he bade his knights privily that
they take heed on their lives that they be all ready on the
morrow and all garnished of their arms, for that it was his
purpose to smite off Lancelot's head and hang it above all the
others.
<P>
<P>
VI.
<P>
The daughter of the lord knew these tidings and was right
sorrowful thereof, for she thinketh never more to have joy at
heart and he shall be slain in such manner.  She sendeth him
greeting by her own privy messenger, as she that loveth him
better than aught else living in the world, and so biddeth and
prayeth him be garnished of his arms, and ready to protect his
life, for that her father is fain to smite off his head.
<P>
"Sir," saith the messenger, "Your force would avail you nought as
against my lord, for to-morrow there will be a dozen knights all
armed at the issue of the gate whereby you entered to-night, and
he saith that he purposeth to cut off your head there where he
cut the heads off the other knights.  Without the gate there will
likewise be another dozen knights all armed.  No knight is there
in the world so good as that he might issue forth of this castle
through the midst of these four and twenty knights, but my lady
sendeth you word that there is a cavern under this castle that
goeth therefrom underground as far as the forest, so that a
knight may well pass thereby all armed, but there is therein a
lion, the fiercest and most horrible in the world, and two
serpents that are called griffons, that have the face of a man
and the beaks of birds and eyes of an owl and teeth of a dog and
ears of an ass and feet of a lion and tail of a serpent, and they
have couched them therewithin, but never saw no man beasts so
fell and felonous.  Wherefore the damsel biddeth you go by that
way, by everything that you have ever loved, and that you fail
her not, for she would fain speak with you at the issue of the
cavern in an orchard that is nigh a right broad river not far
from this castle, and will make your destrier be brought after
you underground."
<P>
"By my head," saith Lancelot, "And she had not conjured me in
such sort, and were it not for love of herself, I would have
rather set myself in hazard with the knights than with the wild
beasts, for far father would I have delivered myself from them,
and so I might, than go forth in such-wise."
<P>
"She sendeth you word," saith the messenger, "that so you do not
thus, no further trouble will she take concerning you.  She doth
it of dread lest she lose your love; and here behold a brachet
that she sendeth you by me that you will carry with you into the
cavern.  So soon as you shalt see the serpent griffons that have
couched them therein, you shall show them this and cast her down
before them.  The griffons love her as much as one beast may love
another, and shall have such joy and such desire to play with the
brachet that they will leave you alone, and have such good will
toward you that they will not look at you after to do you any
hurt.  But no man is there in the world, no matter how well
soever he were armed, nor how puissant soever he were in himself,
might never pass them otherwise, but he should be devoured of
them.  But no safeguard may you have as against the lion but of
God only and your own hardiment."
<P>
"Tell my damsel," saith Lancelot, "that all her commandment will
I do, but this cowardize resembleth none other, that I shall go
fight with beasts and leave to do battle with knights."
<P>
This was then repeated to the damsel, that marvelled her much
thereat, and said that he was the hardiest knight in the world.
<P>
<P>
VII.
<P>
Lancelot armed him toward daybreak, and had his sword girt, his
shield at his neck, and his spear in his hand.  So he entered
into the cavern, all shamefast, and the brachet followeth after,
that he deigned not to carry, and so cometh he to the place where
the griffons were.  So soon as they heard him coming they dress
them on their feet, and then writhe along as serpents, then cast
forth such fire, and so bright a flame amidst the rock, as that
all the cavern is lighted up thereof, and they see by the
brightness of light of their jaws the brachet coming.  So soon as
they have espied her, they carry her in their claws and make her
the greatest cheer in the world.  Lancelot passeth beyond without
gainsay, and espieth, toward the issue of the cavern, the lion
that was come from the forest all famished.  He cometh thither
right hardily, sword drawn.  The lion cometh toward him, jaws
yawning, and claws bared, thinking to fix them in his habergeon,
but Lancelot preventeth him and smiteth him so stoutly that he
cutteth off thigh and leg together.  When the lion feeleth
himself thus maimed, he seizeth him by the teeth and the claws of
his fore feet and rendeth away half the skirt of his habergeon.
Thereupon Lancelot waxeth wroth.  He casteth his shield to the
ground and approacheth the lion closer.  He seeth that he openeth
his jaws wide to avenge himself, and thrusteth his sword the
straightest he may into his gullet, and the lion giveth out a
roar and falleth dead.  The damsel, that had come into the
cavern, heareth that the lion is dead.
<P>
<P>
VIII.
<P>
Lancelot issued forth and so cometh into the orchard beside the
forest, and wiped his sword on the freshness of the green grass.
Thereupon behold you the damsel that cometh.
<P>
"Sir," saith she to Lancelot, "Are you wounded in any place?"
<P>
"Damsel, nowhere, thank God!"
<P>
Another damsel leadeth a horse into the orchard.  The damsel of
the castle looketh at Lancelot.
<P>
"Sir," saith the damsel, "Meseemeth that you are not over
joyous."
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "If I be not, I have good right, for I have
lost the thing in the world that most I loved."
<P>
"And you have won me," saith she, "so you remain not here, that
am the fairest damsel in this kingdom, and I have saved you your
life for this, that you grant me your love, for mine own would I
fain give unto you."
<P>
"Gramercy, damsel," saith Lancelot, "Your love and your good
will fain would I have; but neither you nor none other damsel
ought not to have affiance in me, and I might so soon set
carelessly aside the love to whom my heart owed its obedience,
for the worthiness and the courtesy that were lodged in her.  Nor
never hereafter, so long as I live, shall I love none other in
like manner; wherefore all others commend I to God, and to
yourself, as for leave-taking to one at whose service I fain
would be; I say that if you shall have need of me, and so I be in
place and free, I will do all I may to protect your honour."
<P>
<P>
IX.
<P>
"Ha, God!" saith the damsel, "How am I betrayed, sith that I am
parted from the best knight in the world!  Lancelot, you have
done that which never yet no knight might do!  Now am I grieved
that you should escape on such wise, and that your life hath been
saved in this manner by me.  Better should I love you mine own
dead, than another's living.  Now would I fain that you had had
your head smitten off, and that it were hanging with the others!
So would I solace myself by beholding it!"
<P>
Lancelot took no account of that he heard, for the grief that lay
at his heart of the Queen.  He mounteth on his horse and issueth
forth of the orchard by a postern gate, and entereth into the
forest, and commendeth him to God.  The lord of the Castle of the
Griffons marvelleth much that Lancelot delayeth so long.  He
thinketh that he durst not come down, and saith to his knights,
"Let us go up and cut off his head, sith that he durst not come
down."
<P>
He maketh search for him all through the hall and the chambers,
but findeth him not.
<P>
"He hath gone," saith he, "through the cavern, so have the
griffons devoured him."
<P>
So he sendeth the twain most hardy of his knights to see.  But
the brachet had returned after the damsel, whereof the griffons
were wroth, and they forthwith seized on the two knights that
entered into their cavern and slew them and devoured.
<P>
<P>
X.
<P>
When the lord of the castle knew it, he went into the chamber
where his daughter was, and found her weeping, and thinketh that
it is for the two knights that are dead.  News is brought him
that the lion is dead at the issue of the cavern, and thereby
well knoweth he that Lancelot is gone.  He biddeth his knights
follow after him, but none was there so hardy as that he durst
follow.  The damsel was right fain they should go after him, if
only they might bring him back to the castle, for so mortally was
she taken of his love that she thought of none other thing.  But
Lancelot had her not in remembrance, but only another, and rode
on sadly right amidst the forest, and looked from time to time at
the rent the lion had made in his habergeon.  He rideth until he
is come toward evening to a great valley where was forest on the
one side and the other, and the valley stretched onward half a
score great leagues Welsh.  He looketh to the right, and on the
top of the mountain beside the valley he seeth a chapel newly
builded that was right fair and rich, and it was covered of lead,
and had at the back two quoins that seemed to be of gold.  By the
side of this chapel were three houses dight right richly, each
standing by itself facing the chapel.  There was a right fair
grave-yard round about the chapel, that was enclosed at the
compass of the forest, and a spring came down, full clear, from
the heights of the forest before the chapel and ran into the
valley with a great rushing; and each of the houses had its own
orchard, and the orchard an enclosure.  Lancelot heareth vespers
being chanted in the chapel, and seeth the path that turned
thitherward, but the mountain is so rugged that he could not go
along it on horseback.  So he alighteth and leadeth his horse
after him by the reins until he cometh nigh the chapel.
<P>
<P>
XI.
<P>
There were three hermits therewithin that had sung their vespers,
and came over against Lancelot.  They bowed their heads to him
and he saluted them, and then asked of them what place was this?
And they told him that the place there was Avalon.  They make
stable his horse.  He left his arms without the chapel and
entereth therein, and saith that never hath he seen none so fair
nor so rich.  There were within three other places, right fair
and seemly dight of rich cloths of silk and rich corners and
fringes of gold.  He seeth the images and the crucifixes all
newly fashioned, and the chapel illumined of rich colours; and
moreover in the midst thereof were two coffins, one against the
other, and at the four corners four tall wax tapers burning, that
were right rich, in four right rich candlesticks.  The coffins
were covered with two pails, and there were clerks that chanted
psalms in turn on the one side and the other.
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot to one of the hermits, "For whom were these
coffins made?"
<P>
"For King Arthur and Queen Guenievre."
<P>
"King Arthur is not yet dead," saith Lancelot.
<P>
"No, in truth, please God!  but the body of the Queen lieth in
the coffin before us and in the other is the head of her son,
until such time as the King shall be ended, unto whom God grant
long life!  But the Queen bade at her death that his body should
be set beside her own when he shall end.  Hereof have we the
letters and her seal in this chapel, and this place made she be
builded new on this wise or ever she died."
<P>
<P>
XI.
<P>
When Lancelot heareth that it is the Queen that lieth in the
coffin, he is so straitened in his heart and in his speech that
never a word may he say.  But no semblant of grief durst he make
other than such as might not be perceived, and right great
comfort to him was it that there was an image of Our Lady at the
head of the coffin.  He knelt down the nighest he might to the
coffin, as it had been to worship the image, and set his race and
his mouth to the stone of the coffin, and sorroweth for her right
sweetly.
<P>
"Ha, Lady," saith he, "But that I dread the blame of the people,
never again would I seek to depart from this place, but here
would I save my soul and pray for yours; so would it be much
recomforting to me that I should be so nigh, and should see the
sepulchre wherein your body lieth that had so great sweetness and
bounty.  God grant me of your pleasure, that at my death I may
still be a-nigh, and that I may die in such manner and in such
place as that I may be shrouded and buried in this holy chapel
where this body lieth."
<P>
The night cometh on.  A clerk cometh to the hermits and saith,
"Never yet did no knight cry mercy of God so sweetly, nor of His
sweet Mother, as did this knight that is in the chapel."
<P>
And the hermits make answer that knights for the most part do
well believe in God.  They come to the chapel for him and bid him
come thence, for that meat is ready and he should come to eat,
and after that go to sleep and rest, for it is full time so to
do.  He telleth them that as for his eating this day it is stark
nought, for a desire and a will hath taken him to keep vigil in
the chapel before one of the images of Our Lady.  No wish had he
once to depart thence before the day, and he would fain that the
night should last far longer than it did.  The good men durst not
force him against his will; they say, rather, that the worshipful
man is of good life who will keep watch in such manner throughout
the night without drink or meat, for all that he seemeth to be
right weary.
<P>
<P>
XIII.
<P>
Lancelot was in the chapel until the morrow before the tomb.  The
hermits apparelled them to do the service that they chanted each
day, mass for the soul of the Queen and her son.  Lancelot
heareth them with right good will.  When the masses were sung, he
taketh leave of the hermits and looketh at the coffin right
tenderly.  He commendeth the body that lieth therein to God and
His sweet Mother; then findeth he without the chapel his horse
accoutred ready, and mounteth forthwith, and departeth, and
looketh at the place and the chapel so long as he may see them.
He hath ridden so far that he is come nigh Cardoil, and findeth
the land wasted and desolate, and the towns burnt, whereof is he
sore grieved.  He meeteth a knight that came from that part, and
he was wounded full sore.  Lancelot asketh him whence he cometh,
and he saith, "Sir, from towards Cardoil.  Kay the Seneschal,
with two other knights, is leading away Messire Ywain li Aoutres
toward the castle of the Hard Rock.  I thought to help to rescue
him, but they have wounded me in such sort as you see."
<P>
"Are they ever so far away?" saith Lancelot.
<P>
"Sir, they will pass just now at the head of this forest; and so
you are fain to go thither, I will return with you right
willingly and help you to the best I may."
<P>
Lancelot smiteth his horse with the spurs forthwith, and the
knight after him, and espieth Kay the Seneschal, that was
bringing Messire Ywain along at a great pace, and had set him
upon a trotting hackney, for so he thought that none would know
him.  Lancelot overtaketh him and crieth, "By my head, Kay the
Seneschal, shame had you enough of that you did to King Arthur
when you slew his son, and as much more ought you now to have of
thus warring upon him again!"
<P>
He smiteth his horse of his spurs, lance in rest, and Kay the
Seneschal turneth toward him, and they mell together with their
spears on their shields, and pierce them in such sort that an
ells-length of each shaft passeth through beyond.
<P>
<P>
XIV.
<P>
The lances were strong so as that they brast not.  They draw them
back to themselves so stoutly and come together so fiercely that
their horses stagger and they lose the stirrups.  Lancelot
catcheth Kay the Seneschal at the passing beyond, in the midst of
the breast, and thrusteth his spear into him so far that the
point remained in the flesh, and Kay to-brast his own; and sore
grieved was he when he felt himself wounded.  The knight that was
wounded overthrew one of the two knights.  Kay is on the ground,
and Lancelot taketh his horse and setteth Messire Ywain li
Aoutres thereupon, that was right sore wounded so as that he
scarce might bear it.  Kay the Seneschal maketh his knight
remount, and holdeth his sword grasped in his fist as though he
had been stark wood.  Lancelot seeth the two knights sore badly
wounded, and thinketh that and he stay longer they may remain on
the field.  He maketh them go before him, and Kay the Seneschal
followeth them behind, himself the third knight, that is right
wroth of the wound he feeleth and the blood that he seeth.
Lancelot bringeth off his knights like as the wild-boar goeth
among the dogs, and Kay dealeth him great buffets of his sword
when he may catch him, and Lancelot him again, and so they
depart, fencing in such sort.
<P>
<P>
XV.
<P>
When Kay the Seneschal seeth that he may not harm him, he turneth
him back, full of great wrath, and his heart pricketh to avenge
him thereof and he may get at him, for he is the knight of the
court that most he hateth.  He is come back to the Castle of the
Hard Rock.  Briant of the Isles asketh him who hath wounded him
in such sort, and he telleth him that he was bringing thither
Ywain li Aoutres when Lancelot rescued him.
<P>
"And the King," saith Briant, "Is he repaired thither?"
<P>
"I have heard no tidings of him at all," saith Kay, "For no
leisure had I to ask of any."
<P>
Briant and his knights take much thought as concerning Lancelot's
coming, for they are well persuaded that Lancelot hath come for
that the King is dead and Messire Gawain, whereof they make right
great joy.  Kay the Seneschal maketh him be disarmed and his
wound searched.  They tell him he need not fear it shall be his
death, but that he is right sore wounded.
<P>
<P>
XVI.

Lancelot is entered into the castle of Cardoil, and his wounded
knights withal, and findeth the folk in sore dismay.  Great dole
make they in many places and much lamentation for King Arthur,
and say that now nevermore may they look for succeur to none, and
he be dead and Messire Gawain.  But they give Lancelot joy of
that he hath rescued Messire Ywain li Aoutres, and were so
somewhat comforted and made great cheer.  The tidings thereof
came to the knights that were in the castle, and they all come
forward to meet him save they that were wounded, and so led him
up to the castle, and Messire Ywain with him and the other knight
that was wounded.  All the knights of the castle were right glad,
and ask him tidings of King Arthur, and whether he were dead or
no.  And Lancelot telleth them that he was departed from him at
the Palace Meadow, where he won the white destrier and the crown
of gold there where the tidings were brought to him that Queen
Guinievre was dead.

"Then you tell us of a truth that the King is on live, and
Messire Gawain?"
<P>
"Both, you may be certain!" saith Lancelot.
<P>
Thereupon were they gladder than before.  They told him of their
own mischance, how Briant of the Isles had put them to the worse,
and how Kay the Seneschal was with him to do them hurt.  For he
it is that taketh most pains to do them evil.
<P>
"By my head," saith Lancelot, "Kay the Seneschal ought of right
to take heed and with-hold him from doing you ill, but he
departed from the field with the point of my spear in him when I
rescued Messire Ywain."

The knights are much comforted of the coming of Lancelot, but he
is much grieved that he findeth so many of them wounded.  Meliant
of the Waste Manor is at the castle of the Hard Rock, and good
fellow is it betwixt him and Kay the Seneschal.  He is right glad
of the tidings he hath heard, that Lancelot is come, and saith
that he is the knight of the world that most he hateth, and that
he will avenge him of his father and he may meet him.  There come
before the castle of Cardoil one day threescore knights armed,
and they seize upon their booty betwixt the castle and the
forest.  Lancelot issueth forth all armed, and seven of the best
of the castle with him.  He cometh upon them after that they have
led away their plunder.  He overtaketh one knight and smiteth him
with his spear right through the body, and the other knights make
an onset upon the others and many to-brake their spears, and much
clashing was there of steel on armour; and there fell at the
assembly on one side and the other full a score knights, whereof
some were wounded right sore.  Meliant of the Waste Manor espied
Lancelot, and right great joy made he of seeing him, and smiteth
him so stout a buffet on the shield that he to-breaketh his
spear.

Lancelot smiteth him amidst the breast so grimly that he maketh
him bend backwards over the saddle behind, and so beareth him to
the ground, legs uppermost, over his horse's croup, and trampleth
him under his horse's feet.  Lancelot was minded to alight to the
ground to take him, but Briant of the Isles cometh and maketh him
mount again perforce.  The numbers grew on the one side and the
other of knights that came from Cardoil and from the Hard Rock.
Right great was the frushing of lances and the clashing of swords
and the overthrow of horses and knights.  Briant of the Isles and
Lancelot come against each other so stoutly that they pierce
their shields and cleave their habergeons, and they thrust with
their spears so that the flesh is broken under the ribs and the
shafts are all-to-splintered.  They hurtle against each other so
grimly at the by-passing that their eyes sparkle as it were of
stars in their heads, and the horses stagger under them.  They
hold their swords drawn, and so return the one toward the other
like lions.  Such buffets deal they upon their helms that they
beat them in and make the fire leap out by the force of the
smiting of iron by steel. And Meliant cometh all armed toward
Lancelot to aid Briant of the Isles, but Lucan the Butler cometh
to meet him, and smiteth him with his spear so stoutly that he
thrusteth it right through his shield and twisteth his arm gainst
his side.  He breaketh his spear at the by-passing, and Meliant
also breaketh his, but he was wounded passing sore.

Thereupon he seizeth him by the bridle and thinketh to lead him
away, but the knights and the force of Briant rescue him.  The
clashing of arms lasted great space betwixt Briant of the Isles
and Lancelot, and each was mightily wrath for that each was
wounded.  Either seized other many times by the bridle, and each
was right fain to lead the other to his own hold, but the force
of knights on the one side and the other disparted them asunder.
Thus the stour lasted until evening, until that the night
sundered them.  But Briant had nought to boast of at departing,
for Lancelot and his men carried off four of his by force right
sore wounded, besides them that remained dead on the field.
Briant of the Isles and Meliant betook them back all sorrowful
for their knights that are taken and dead.  Lancelot cometh back
to Cardoil, and they of the castle make him right great joy of
the knights that they bring taken, and say that the coming of the
good knight Lancelot should be great comfort to them until such
time as King Arthur should repair back and Messire Gawain.  The
wounded knights that were in the castle turned to healing of
their wounds, whereof was Lancelot right glad.  They were as many
as five and thirty within the castle.  Of all the King's knights
were there no more save Lancelot and the wounded knight that he
brought along with him.
