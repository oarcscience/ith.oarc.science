<H1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXX</H1> 
TITLE I.
<P>
Of Briant of the Isles the story is here silent, whom King the
believeth too much in many things, and saith that Lancelot goeth
his way right through the forest, full heavy in thought.  He had
not ridden far when he met a knight that was right sore wounded.
He asked him whence he came and who had wounded him in such
manner.
<P>
"Sir," saith he, "I come from the Chapel Perilous, where I was
not able to defend me against an evil folk that appeared there;
and they have wounded me in such sort as you see, and but for a
damsel that came thereinto from the forest I should not have
escaped on live.  But she aided me on such condition that and I
should see a knight they call Lancelot, or Perceval, or Messire
Gawain, I should tell which of them soever I should first meet
withal that he should go to her without delay, for much she
marvelleth her that none of them cometh into the chapel, for none
ought to enter there but good knights only.  But much do I
marvel, Sir, how the damsel durst enter there, for it is the most
marvellous place that is, and the damsel is of right great
beauty; natheless she cometh thither oftentimes alone into the
chapel.  A knight lieth in the chapel that hath been slain of
late, that was a fell and cruel knight and a hardy."
<P>
"What was his name?" saith Lancelot.
<P>
"He was named Ahuret the Bastard," saith the knight; "And he had
but one arm and one hand, and the other was smitten off at a
castle that Messire Gawain gave Meliot of Logres when he
succoured him against this knight that lieth in the coffin.  And
Meliot of Logres hath slain the knight that had assieged the
castle, but the knight wounded him sore, so that he may not be
whole save he have the sword wherewith he wounded him, that lieth
in the coffin at his side, and some of the cloth wherein he is
enshrouded; and, so God grant me to meet one of the knights,
gladly will I convey unto him the damsel's message."
<P>
"Sir Knight," saith Lancelot, "One of them have you found.  My
name is Lancelot, and for that I see you are wounded and in evil
plight, I tell it you thus freely."
<P>
"Sir," saith the knight, "Now may God protect your body, for you
go in great peril of death.  But the damsel much desireth to see
you, I know not for what, and well may she aid you if she will."
<P>
<P>
II.
<P>
"Sir Knight, God hath brought us forth of many a peril, and so
will He also from this and it be His pleasure and His will."
<P>
With that, Lancelot departeth from the knight, and hath ridden so
far that he is come at evensong to the Chapel Perilous, that
standeth in a great valley of the forest, and hath a little
churchyard about it that is well enclosed on all sides, and hath
an ancient cross without the entrance.  The chapel and the
graveyard are overshadowed of the forest, that is right tall.
Lancelot entereth therein all armed.  He signeth him of the cross
and blesseth him and commendeth him to God.  He seeth in the
grave-yard coffins in many places, and it seemeth him that he
seeth folk round about that talk together, the one with another.
But he might not hear that they said.  He might not see them
openly, but very tall they seemed him to be.  He is come toward
the chapel and alighteth of his horse, and seeth a shed outside
the chapel, wherein was provender for horses.  He goeth thither
to set his own there, then leaneth his shield against his spear
at the entrance of the chapel, and entereth in, where it was very
dark, for no light was there save only of a single lamp that
shone full darkly.  He seeth the coffin that was in the midst of
the chapel wherein the knight lay.
<P>
<P>
III.
<P>
When he had made his orison before an image of Our Lady, he
cometh to the coffin and openeth it as fast as he may, and seeth
the knight, tall and foul of favour, that therein lay dead.  The
cloth wherein he was enshrouded was displayed all bloody.  He
taketh the sword that lay at his side and lifteth the
windingsheet to rend it at the seam, then taketh the knight by
the head to lift him upward, and findeth him so heavy and so
ungain that scarce may he remove him.  He cutteth off the half of
the cloth wherein he is enshrouded, and the coffin beginneth to
make a crashing so passing loud that it seemed the chapel were
falling.  When he hath the piece of the cloth and the sword he
closeth the coffin again, and forthwith cometh to the door of the
chapel and seeth mount, in the midst of the grave-yard as it
seemed him, great knights. and horrible, and they are appareled
as it were to combat, and him thinketh that they are watching for
him and espy him.
<P>
<P>
IV.
<P>
Thereupon, behold you, a damsel running, her kirtle girt high
about her, right through the grave-yard a great pace.
<P>
"Take heed you move not until such time as it is known who the
knight is!"  She is come to the chapel.  "Sir Knight, lay down
the sword and this that you have taken of the windingsheet of the
dead knight!"
<P>
"Damsel," saith Lancelot, "What hurt doth it you of this that I
have?"
<P>
"This," saith she, "That you have taken it without my leave; for
I have him in charge, both him and the chapel.  And I would
fain," saith she, "know what is your name?"
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "What would you gain of knowing my name?"
<P>
"I know not," saith she, "whether I shall have either loss or
gain thereof, but high time already is it that I should ask you
it to my sorrow, for many a time have I been deceived therein."
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "I am called Lancelot of the Lake."
<P>
"You ought of right," saith she, "to have the sword and the
cloth; but come you with me to my castle, for oftentimes have I
desired that you and Perceval and Messire Gawain should see the
three tombs that I have made for your three selves."
<P>
<P>
V.
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "No wish have I to see my sepulchre so early
betimes."
<P>
"By my head," saith she, "And you come not thither, you may not
issue from hence without tribulation; and they that you see there
are earthly fiends that guard this grave-yard and are at my
commandment."
<P>
"Never, damsel, please God," saith Lancelot, "may your devils
have power to harm a Christian."
<P>
"Ha, Lancelot," saith she, "I beseech and pray you that you come
with me into my castle, and I will save your life as at this time
from this folk that are just now ready to fall upon you; and, so
you are not willing to do this, yield me back the sword that you
have taken from the coffin, and go your way at once."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Into your castle may I not go, nor
desire I to go, wherefore pray me no more thereof, for other
business have I to do; nor will I yield you back the sword,
whatsoever may befall me, for a certain knight may not otherwise
be healed, and great pity it were that he should die."
<P>
"Ha, Lancelot," saith she, "How hard and cruel do I find you
towards me!  And as good cause have I to be sorry that you have
the sword as have you to be glad.  For, and you had not had it
upon you, never should you have carried it off from hence at your
will; rather should I have had all my pleasure of you, and I
would have made you be borne into my castle, from whence never
should you nave moved again for nought you might do; and thus
should I have been quit of the wardenship of this chapel and of
coming thereinto in such manner as now oftentimes I needs must
come.
<P>
<P>
VI.
<P>
"But now am I taken in a trap, for, so long as you have the
sword, not one of them that are there yonder can do you evil nor
hinder you of going."
<P>
Of this was Lancelot not sorry.  He taketh leave of the damsel,
that departeth grudgingly, garnisheth him again of his arms, then
mounteth again on his horse and goeth his way right through the
grave-yard.  He beholdeth this evil folk, that were so foul and
huge and hideous, it seemed as if they would devour everything.
They made way for Lancelot, and had no power to hurt him.  He is
issued forth of the grave-yard and goeth his way through the
forest until daylight appeared about him, fair and clear.  He
found the hermit there where he had heard mass, then ate a
little, then departed and rode the day long until setting of the
sun, but could find no hold on the one side nor the other wherein
he might lodge, and so was benighted in the forest.
<P>
<P>
VII.
<P>
Lancelot knew not which way to turn, for he had not often been in
the forest, and knew not how the land lay nor the paths therein.
He rode until he found a little causeway, and there was a path at
the side that led to an orchard that was at a corner of the
forest, where there was a postern gate whereby one entered, and
it was not made fast for the night.  And the orchard was well
enclosed with walls.  Lancelot entered in and made fast the
entrance, then took off his horse's bridle and let him feed on
the grass.  He might not espy the castle that was hard by for the
abundance of trees and the darkness of the night, and so knew not
whither he was arrived.  He laid his shield for a pillow and his
arms at his side and fell on sleep.  But, had he known where it
was he had come, little sleep would he have had, for he was close
to the cavern where he slew the lion and where the griffons were,
that had come in from the forest all gorged of victual, and were
fallen on sleep, and it was for them that the postern gate had
been left unbolted.  A damsel went down from a chamber by a
trapdoor with a brachet on her arm for fear of the griffons, and
as she went toward the postern-gate to lock it, she espied
Lancelot, that lay asleep in the midst of the orchard.  She ran
back to her Lady the speediest she might, and said unto her: "Up,
Lady!" saith she, "Lancelot is sleeping in the orchard!"
<P>
She leapt up incontinent and came to the orchard there where
Lancelot was sleeping, then sate her down beside him and began to
look at him, sighing the while, and draweth as near him as she
may.
<P>
"Fair Lord God," saith she, "what shall I do?  and I wake him
first he will have no care to kiss me, and if I kiss him sleeping
he will awake forthwith; and better hap is it for me to take the
most I may even in such-wise than to fail of all, and, moreover,
if so be I shall have kissed him, I may hope that he will not
hate me thereof, sith that I may then boast that I have had at
least so much of that which is his own."
<P>
She set her mouth close to him and so kissed him the best and
fairest she might, three times, and Lancelot awakened forthwith.
He leapt up and made the cross upon him, then looked at the
damsel, and said: "Ha, God!  where, then, am I?"
<P>
"Fair sweet friend," saith she, "You are nigh her that hath all
set her heart upon you and will remove it never."
<P>
"I cry you mercy, damsel," saith Lancelot, "and I tell you, for
nought that may befall, one that loveth me, please God, never
will I hate!  but that which one hath loved long time ought not
so soon to fall away from the remembrance of a love that is
rooted in the heart, when she hath been proven good and loyal,
nor ought one so soon to depart therefrom."
<P>
<P>
VIII.
<P>
"Sir," saith she, "This castle is at your commandment, and you
will remain therein, and well may you know my thought towards
you.  Would that your thought were the same towards me."
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "I seek the healing of a knight that may not
be healed save I bring him the head of one of your serpents."
<P>
"Certes, Sir, so hath it been said.  But I bade the damsel say so
only for that I was fain you should come back hither to me."
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "I have come back hither, and so may I turn
back again sith that of the serpent's head is there no need."
<P>
"Ha, Lancelot," saith she, "How good a knight are you, and how
ill default do you make in another way!  No knight, methinketh,
is there in the world that would have refused me save only you.
This cometh of your folly, and your outrage, and your baseness of
heart!  The griffons have not done my will in that they have not
slain you or strangled you as you slept, and, so I thought that
they would have power to slay you, I would make them come to slay
you now.  But the devil hath put so much knighthood into you that
scarce any man may have protection against you.  Better ought I
to love you dead than alive.  By my head, I would fain that your
head were hanged with the others that hang at the entrance of the
gateway, and, had I thought you would have failed me in such wise
I would have brought my father hither to where you were sleeping,
and right gladly would he have slain you."
<P>
<P>
IX.
<P>
"None that knoweth the covenant between me and you ought to hold
you for a good knight; for you have cozened me of my right
according to the tenor and custom of the castle if that through
perversity or slothfulness you durst not take me when you have
won me."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Lancelot, "You may say your will.  You have done
so much for me sithence that I came hither that I ought not to be
afeard of you, for traitor is the man or woman that kisseth
another to procure his hurt."
<P>
"Lancelot, I took but that I might have, for well I see that none
more thereof may I have never again."
<P>
He goeth to put the bridle on his destrier, and then taketh leave
of the damsel, that parteth from him right sorrowfully; but
Lancelot would no longer tarry, for great throng of knights was
there in the castle, and he was not minded to put him in jeopardy
for nought.  He issueth forth of the orchard, and the damsel
looketh after him as long as she may see him.  After that, cometh
she to her chamber, sad and vexed at heart, nor knoweth she how
she may bear herself, for the thing in the world that most she
loveth is far away, and no joy may she have thereof.
<P>
<P>
X.
<P>
Lancelot rideth right amidst the forest until it is day, and
cometh at the right hour of noon to the Castle Perilous, where
Meliot of Logres lay.  He entered into the castle.  The damsel
that was at King Arthur's court cometh to meet him.
<P>
"Lancelot," saith she, "Welcome may you be!"
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "Good adventure may you have!"
<P>
He was alighted at the mountingstage of the hall.  She maketh him
mount up the steps and afterward be disarmed.
<P>
"Damsel," saith he, "Behold, here is some of the winding-sheet
wherein the knight was shrouded, and here is his sword; but you
befooled me as concerning the serpent's head."
<P>
"By my head," saith the damsel, "that did I for the sake of the
damsel of the Castle of Griffons that hateth you not a whit, for
so prayed she me to do.  Now hath she seen you, and so will she
be more at ease, and will have no cause to ask me thereof."
<P>
<P>
XI.
<P>
The damsel leadeth Lancelot to where Meliot of Logres lay.
Lancelot sitteth him down before him and asketh how it is with
him?
<P>
"Meliot," saith the damsel, "This is Lancelot, that bringeth you
your healing."
<P>
"Ha, Sir, welcome may you be!"
<P>
"God grant you health speedily," said Lancelot.
<P>
"Ha, for God's sake," saith Meliot, "What doth Messire Gawain? 
Is he hearty?"
<P>
"I left him quite hearty when I parted from him," saith Lancelot,
"And so he knew that you had been wounded in such sort, full
sorry would he be thereof and King Arthur likewise."
<P>
"Sir," saith he, "The knight that assieged them maimed me in this
fashion, but was himself maimed in such sort that he is dead
thereof.  But the wounds that he dealt me are so cruel and so
raging, that they may not be healed save his sword toucheth them
and if be not bound with some of the winding-sheet wherein he was
shrouded, that he had displayed about him, all bloody."
<P>
"By my faith," saith the damsel, "Behold them here!"
<P>
"Ha, Sir," saith he, "Gramercy of this great goodness!  In every
way appeareth it that you are good knight, for, but for the
goodness of your knighthood, the coffin wherein the knight lieth
had never opened so lightly, nor would you never have had the
sword nor the cloth, nor never till now hath knight entered
therein but either he were slain there, or departed thence
wounded right grievously."
<P>
They uncover his wounds, and Lancelot unbindeth them, and the
damsel toucheth him of the sword and the winding-sheet, and they
are assuaged for him.  And he saith that now at last he knoweth
well he need not fear to die thereof.  Lancelot is right joyful
thereof in his heart, for that he seeth he will be whole betimes;
and sore pity had it been of his death, for a good knight was he,
and wise and loyal.
<P>
<P>
XI.
<P>
"Lancelot," saith the lady, "Long time have I hated you on
account of the knight that I loved, whom you reft away from me
and married to another and not to me, and ofttimes have I put
myself to pains to grieve you of some ill deed for that you did
to me, for never was I so sorrowful for aught that befell me.  He
loved me of right great love, and I him again, and never shall
that love fail.  But now is it far further away from me than it
was before, and for this bounty that you have done, never
hereafter need you fear aught of my grievance."
<P>
"Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Gramercy heartily."
<P>
He was lodged in the castle the night richly and worshipfully,
and departed thence on the morrow when he had taken leave of the
damsel and Meliot, and goeth back a great pace toward the court
of King Arthur, that was sore dismayed, for Madeglant was
conquering his islands and great part of his land.  The more part
of the lands that he conquered had renounced the New Law for fear
of death and held the false believe.  And Messire Gawain and many
other knights were departed from King Arthur's court for that the
King trusted more in Briant of the Isles than he did in them.
<P>
<P>
XIII.
<P>
For many times had King Arthur sent knights against Madeglant
since Lancelot was departed from the court, to the intent that
they should put to rebuke the enemies of his land, but never saw
he one come back from thence nought discomfited.  The King of
Oriande made much boast that he would fulfil for his sister all
that she had bidden him, for he thought that King Arthur would
yield himself up betimes unto him and yield all his land
likewise.  The King greatly desired the return of Lancelot, and
said ofttimes that and he had been against his enemies as nigh as
the others he had sent they would not have durst so to fly
against him.  In the midst of the dismay wherein was King Arthur,
Lancelot returned to the court, whereof was the King right
joyous.  Lancelot knew that Messire Gawain and Messire Ywain were
not there, and that they held them aloof from the court more
willingly than they allowed on account of Briant of the Isles,
that King Arthur believed in more than ever a one of the others.
He was minded to depart in like sort, but the King would not let
him, but said to him rather, "Lancelot, I pray and beseech you,
as him that I love much, that you set your pains and your counsel
on defending my land, for great affiance have I in you."
<P>
"Sir," saith Lancelot, "My aid and my force shall fail you never;
take heed that yours fail not me."
<P>
"Of right ought I not to fail you," saith the King, "Nor will I
never, for I should fail myself thereby."
<P>
<P>
XIV.
<P>
The history saith that he gave Lancelot forty knights in charge,
and that he is come into an island where King Madeglant was.  Or
ever he knew of his coming, Lancelot had cut off his retreat, for
he cut his cables and beat his anchors to pieces and broke up his
ships.  After that, he struck among the people of Madeglant, and
slew as many of them as he would, he and his knights.  The King
thought to withdraw him back, both him and his fellowship, into
safety as he wont, but he found himself right ill bested.
Lancelot drove him toward the sea, whither he fled, but only to
find himself no less discomfit there, and slew him in the midst
of his folk, and all his other knights were slain and cast into
the sea.  This island was freed of him by Lancelot, and from
thence he went to the other islands that Madeglant had conquered
and set again under the false Law, and there did away the false
Law from them that had been set thereunder by fear of death, and
stablished the land in such sort as it had been tofore.  He roved
so long from one island to another that presently he came to
Albanie where he had succoured them at first.
<P>
<P>
XV.
<P>
When they of the land saw him come, they well knew that the King
of Oriande was dead and the islands made free, whereof made they
great joy.  The land was some deal emptied of the most puissant
and the strongest, for they were dead along with their lord.
Lancelot had brought with him some of the best knights and most
puissant.  He was come with a great navy into the land and began
to destroy it.  They of the land were misbelievers, for they
believed in false idols and in false images.  They saw that they
might not defend the land, sith that their lord was dead.  The
more part let themselves be slain for that they would not
renounce the evil Law, and they that were minded to turn to God
were saved.  The kingdom was right rich and right great that
Lancelot conquered and attorned to the Law of Our Lord in such
wise.  He made break all the false images of copper and fatten
wherein they had believed tofore, and whereof false answers came
to them of the voices of devils.  Thereafter he caused be made
crucifixes and images in the likeness of Our Lord, and in the
likeness of His sweet Mother, the better to confirm them of the
kingdoms in the Law.
<P>
<P>
XVI.
<P>
The strongest and most valiant of the land assembled one day and
said that it was high time a land so rich should no longer be
without a King.  They all agreed and came to Lancelot and told
him how they would fain that he should be King of the realm he
had conquered, for in no land might he be better employed, and
they would help him conquer other realms enow.  Lancelot thanked
them much, but told them that of this land nor of none other
would he be King save by the good will of King Arthur only; for
that all the conquest he had made was his, and by his commandment
had he come thither, and had given him his own knights in charge
that had helped him to reconquer the lands.
<P>
<P>
XVII.
<P>
King Claudas had heard tell how Lancelot had slain the King of
Oriande and that none of the islands might scarce be defended
against him.  He had no liking of him, neither of his good
knighthood nor of his conquest, for well remembered he of the
land that he had conquered from King Ban of Benoic that was
Lancelot's father, and therefore was he sorry of the good
knighthood whereof Lancelot was everywhere held of worth and
renown, for that he was tenant of his father's land.  King
Claudas sent a privy message to Briant and bore him on hand that,
and he might do so much as that King Arthur should forbid
Lancelot his court, and that it were ill with him with the King,
he would have much liking thereof and would help him betimes to
take vengeance on his enemies, for, so Lancelot were forth of his
court, and Messire Gawain, the rest would scarce abide long time,
and thus should they have all their will of King Arthur's land.
Briant sent word back to King Claudas that Messire Gawain and
Messire Ywain began to hold them aloof from the court, and that
as for most part of the other he need not trouble him a whit, for
he might so deal as that in short time Lancelot should be well
trounced, would they or nould they.
<P>
<P>
XVIII.
<P>
Tidings are come to King Arthur's court that the King of Oriande
is dead and his people destroyed, and that Lancelot hath
conquered his kingdom and slain the King, and reconquered all the
lands wherein he had set the false Law and the false believe by
his force and by dread of him.  And the more part say in the
court that they of the realm of Oriande nor those of the other
islands will not let Lancelot repair to court, and are doing
their endeavour to make him King; and nought is there in the
world, and he command them, they will not do, and that never was
no folk so obedient to any as are they of all these lands to him.
Briant of the Isles cometh one day privily to King Arthur, and
saith: "Sir," saith he, "Much ought I to love you, for that you
have made me Seneschal of your land; whereby meseemeth you have
great affiance in me, and my bounden duty is it to turn aside
that which is evil from you and to set forward your good
everywhere, and, did I not so, no whit loyal should I be towards
you.
<P>
<P>
XIX.
<P>
"Tidings are come to me of late that they of the kingdom of
Oriande and Albanie and of the other islands that are your
appanages have all leagued together, and have sworn and given
surety that they will aid one another against you, and they are
going presently to make Lancelot their King, and will come down
upon your land as speedily as they may wheresoever he may dare
lead them, and they have sworn their oath that they will conquer
your kingdom just as you now hold it, and, so you be not
garnished against them betimes, you may have thereof sore trouble
to your own body as well as the loss whereof I tell you."
<P>
"By my head," saith the King, "I believe not that Lancelot durst
think this, nor that he would have the heart to do me evil."
<P>
"By my head," saith Briant, "Long time have I had misgivings both
of this and of him, but one ought not to tell one's lord all that
one knows, for that one cannot be sure either that it be not
leasing or that folk wish to meddle in his affairs out of envy.
But nought is there in the world that I will conceal from you
henceforward for the love that you bear me and for that you have
affiance in me, and so may you well have, for I have abandoned my
land for you that marched with your own, whereby you may sorely
straiten your enemies, for well you know that in your court is
there no knight of greater puissance than am I."
<P>
<P>
XX.
<P>
"By my head," saith the King, "I am fain to love you and hold you
dear, nor shall you never be removed from my love nor from my
service for nought that may be said of any, so manifestly have I
seen your goodness and your loyalty.  I will bid Lancelot by my
letters and under my seal that he come to speak with me, for sore
need have I thereof, and when he shall be here we will take
account of this that you have told me, for this will I not, that
he nor none other that may be my knight shall dare rise in arms
against me, for such power ought lord of right to have over his
knight, and to be feared and dreaded of him, for elsewise is he
feeble, and lordship without power availeth nought."
<P>
<P>
XXI.
<P>
The King sent his letters by his messenger to Lancelot.  The
messenger sought him until he found him in the kingdom of
Oriande, and delivered him the letters and the seal of the King.
So soon as he knew that which the letters say, he took leave of
them of the land, that were right sorrowful.  He departed thence
and came back to Cardoil, bringing with him all the knights that
he had in charge, and told the King that he had reconquered for
him all the islands, and that the King of Oriande was dead and
that his land was attorned to the Law of Our Lord.  The King bade
Briant of the Isles that he should make forty knights come armed
under their cloaks ready to take Lancelot prisoner as soon as he
should command them.  The tidings come to Lancelot, there where
he was in his hostel, that the King had made knights come all
armed to the palace.  Lancelot bethought him that some need had
arisen and that he would arm himself likewise, so he made him be
armed and came to the hall where the King was.
<P>
"Sir," saith Briant, "Lancelot thinketh him of something, for he
hath armed himself at his hostel, and is come hither in such
manner and at such time without your leave, and he may do
something more yet.  You ought well to ask him wherefore he
wisheth to do you evil, and in what manner you have deserved it." 
<P>
He biddeth him be called before him.  "Lancelot," saith the King,
"Wherefore are you armed?"
<P>
"Sir, I was told that knights had come in hither armed, and I was
feared lest some mishap had befallen you, for I would not that
any evil should betide you."
<P>
"You come hither for another thing," saith the King, "according
to that I have been given to wit, and, had the hall been void of
folk, you hoped to have slain me."
<P>
The King commandeth him be taken forthwith without gainsay of
any.  The knights that were armed did off their cloaks and leapt
toward him on all sides, for they durst not disobey the King's
commandment, and the more part were men of Briant of the Isles.
<P>

XXII.
<P>
Lancelot seeth them coming towards him with their keen swords and
saith, "By my head, an evil guerdon do you return me of the
services I have done for you."
<P>
The knights come to him all together swords drawn, and run upon
him all at once.  He goeth defending himself, as far as the wall
of the hall, whereof he maketh a castle to his back, but before
he cometh thither he hath slain or wounded seven.  He began to
defend himself right stoutly on all sides, but they gave him
great buffets of their swords, and no fair play is it of thirty
or forty blows to one.  Nor ought none believe that one single
knight might deliver himself from so many men, seeing that they
were eager to take him and do him a hurt.  Lancelot defended him
the best he might, but the numbers were against him, and, anyway,
or ever he let himself be taken he sold himself right dear, for
of the forty knights he harmed at least a score, and of them was
none that was not sore wounded and the most part killed; and he
caught Briant of the Isles, that was helping to take him, so sore
that he made his sword drink the blood of his body, in such sort
that the wound was right wide.  The knights laid hold on Lancelot
on all sides, and the King commanded that none should harm him,
but that they should bring him to his dungeon in the prison.
Lancelot marvelled him much wherefore the King should do this,
nor might he understand wherefore this hatred was come so lately.
He is put in the prison so as the King hath commanded.  All they
of the court are sorry thereof, save Briant and his knights, but
well may he yet aby it dear, so God bring Lancelot out or prison.
Some say, "Now is the King's court lost, sith that Messire Gawain
and the other knights have thus forsaken it, and Lancelot is put
in prison for doing well, ill trust may the others have therein."
<P>
They pray God yet grant Briant of the Isles an evil guerdon, for
well know they that all this is of his procurement.  And of an
evil guerdon shall he not fail so God protect Lancelot and bring
him forth of prison.
