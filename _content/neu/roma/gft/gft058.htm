<p>A tree can never be quite dead as long as it puts forth shoots; I fancy the very latest shoot in the whole Yggdrasil of European folk-tales</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxi</font></A></p>  
<p>is the episode in 'The Tinker and his Wife' (<A HREF="gft130.htm#an_70">No. 70</A>), where the tinker buys a barrel of beer, and says, 'Now, my wench, you make the biggest penny out of it as ever you can,' and she goes and sells the whole barrel to a packman for one of the old big pennies. That episode cannot be earlier than the introduction of the new bronze coinage in 1861; it looks as though it must itself be a recent coinage of Cornelius Price, or of Nebuchan&#275;zar, his uncle. But, there, I have known a Gypsy girl dash off what was almost a folk-tale impromptu. She had been to a pic-nic in a four-in-hand, with 'a lot o&#8217; real tip-top gentry'; and '<i>Re&iacute;a</i>,' she said to me afterwards, 'I'll tell you the comicalest thing as ever was. We&#8217;d pulled up, to put the brake on and there was a <i>p&uacute;ro hotchiw&iacute;tchi</i> (old hedgehog) come and looked at us through the hedge, looked at me hard. I could see he 'd his eye upon me. And home he'd go, that old hedgehog, to his wife, and "Missus," he'd say, "what d&#8217; ye think? I seen a little Gypsy gal just now in a coach and four bosses"; and "<i>D&aacute;bla!</i>" she 'd say, "<i>sawk&uacute;mni &#8217;as vard&eacute; ken&aacute;w</i>"' (Bless us! every one now keeps a carriage).</p>
