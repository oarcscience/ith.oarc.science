### 'Greek Gypsies.'

In July 1886 ninety-nine Gypsies arrived by train at Liverpool. They
were called the 'Greek Gypsies,' and had started from Corfu, but
according to their passports came from all parts of Greece and European
Turkey, as also from Servia, Bulgaria, Roumania, even Smyrna. Three
hundred napoleons their

journey had cost them thus far, and they meant to take shipping to New
York. But America being closed to 'pauper' immigrants, no steamboat
company would accept them, and they had perforce to encamp at Liverpool.
Their encampment was visited by Mr. David MacRitchie and Mr. H. T.
Crofton, the joint author with Dr. Bath Smart of the admirable *Dialect
of the English Gipsies* (1875); the former wrote an excellent article
about them in *Chambers's Journal* for September 1886. These Gypsies
were not Caldarari, though some of them were coppersmiths (designated as
'chaudronniers'); others were builders, bricklayers, and agriculturists.
They were typical Gypsies in physique, but not in apparel, 'absolutely
free from the vice of drunkenness,' but most inveterate beggars. Their
chief spokesman 'was quite an accomplished linguist, and could speak
Greek, Russian, Roumanian, and two or three other dialects of
south-eastern Europe. The curious thing was, that he never once included
in his list his own mother tongue, the speech of the Gypsy race. Neither
would he admit that he was a Ziganka, not for a long time, at anyrate;
but subsequently both he and his comrades answered to the name of
*Roum*; and the cigar was no longer *bōn’* but *lásho*.' After stopping
some time at Liverpool, these Gypsies crossed over to Hull, but neither
there could they get passage to America; about a year later, so an
English Gypsy informed me, a showman was exhibiting them, or some of
them, through Yorkshire. Their subsequent fate is unknown to me; perhaps
they are in process of absorption into English Gypsydom.
