### Appearance in West.

Late in 1417 a band of 'Secani' or Tsigans, 300 in number, besides
children and infants, arrived in Germany 'from Eastern parts' or 'from
Tartary.' Their presence is first recorded at Luneburg; and thence they
passed on to Hamburg, Lübeck, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, and
Greifswald, At their head rode a duke and a count, richly dressed, with
silver belts, and leading like nobles dogs of chase; next came a motley
crew afoot; and women and children brought up the rear in waggons. They
bore letters of safe-conduct from princes, one of which from the Emperor
Sigismund they had probably procured that same year at Lindau on Lake
Constance; and they gave out that they were on a seven years'
pilgrimage, imposed by their own bishops as a penance for apostasy from
the Christian faith. They encamped in the fields by night outside the
city walls, and were great thieves, especially the women, 'wherefore
several were taken and slain.' In 1418 they are heard of at Leipzig, at
Frankfort-on-Main, and in Switzerland at Zurich, Basel, Berne, and
Soleure: the contemporary Swiss chronicler, Conrad Justinger, speaks of
them as 'more than two hundred baptized Heathens from Egypt, pitiful,
black, miserable, and unbearable on account of their thefts, for they
stole all they could.' At Augsburg they passed for exiles from 'Lesser
Egypt'; at Macon in August 1419 they practised palmistry and necromancy;
and at Sisteron in Provence as 'Saracens' they got large rations from
the terrified townsfolk. In 1420 Lord Andreas, Duke of Little Egypt, and
a hundred men, women, and children, came to Deventer in the Low
Countries; and the aldermen had to pay 19 florins 10 placks for their
bread, beer, herrings, and straw, as well as for cleaning out the barn
in which they lay. At Tournay in 1421 'Sir Miquiel, Prince of Latinghem
in Egypt,' received twelve gold pieces, with bread and a barrel of beer.
