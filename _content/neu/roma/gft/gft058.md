### Story-Telling a living Gypsy art.

A tree can never be quite dead as long as it puts forth shoots; I fancy
the very latest shoot in the whole Yggdrasil of European folk-tales

<span id="page_lxxxi">p. lxxxi</span>

is the episode in 'The Tinker and his Wife' ([No.
70](gft130.htm#an_70)), where the tinker buys a barrel of beer, and
says, 'Now, my wench, you make the biggest penny out of it as ever you
can,' and she goes and sells the whole barrel to a packman for one of
the old big pennies. That episode cannot be earlier than the
introduction of the new bronze coinage in 1861; it looks as though it
must itself be a recent coinage of Cornelius Price, or of Nebuchanēzar,
his uncle. But, there, I have known a Gypsy girl dash off what was
almost a folk-tale impromptu. She had been to a pic-nic in a
four-in-hand, with 'a lot o’ real tip-top gentry'; and '*Reía*,' she
said to me afterwards, 'I'll tell you the comicalest thing as ever was.
We’d pulled up, to put the brake on and there was a *púro hotchiwítchi*
(old hedgehog) come and looked at us through the hedge, looked at me
hard. I could see he 'd his eye upon me. And home he'd go, that old
hedgehog, to his wife, and "Missus," he'd say, "what d’ ye think? I seen
a little Gypsy gal just now in a coach and four bosses"; and "*Dábla!*"
she 'd say, "*sawkúmni ’as vardé kenáw*"' (Bless us! every one now keeps
a carriage).
