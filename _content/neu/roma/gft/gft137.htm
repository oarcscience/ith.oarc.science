<p>P. 249.--The following Negro folk-tale, first printed by me in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for 10th August 1887, p. 245, was taken down by an American acquaintance, Mr. J. P. Suverkrop, C.E., in 1871, at Sand Mountain, Alabama, from the recitation of his negro servant, Dick Brown, about thirty years old, who was a native of Petersburg, Virginia, and there had got it from his granny. It seems to be clearly a variant of 'The Master Smith' (Clouston, ii. 409) and of Grimm's No. 147, 'The Old Man made Young Again' (ii. 215, 444). If so, it must be a comparatively recent transmission from one race (Aryan) to another (non-Aryan), yet it is as thoroughly localised as folk-tale well could be.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">DE NEW HAN&#8217;.</h3>  
<p>Wunst dar wer a sawmill on de aige of a wood not a thousan mili from heah, wid a branch a-runnin by a-turnin de wheel. An ole colored man, he kep de mill an wer a very fine kine of man; but he son Sam, what help him, didn&#8217; take arter de ole man, but wer a triflin, no account sort o&#8217; young man; an&#8217; de ole man had to wuk right sharp to git along.

De ole man wer glad to git his help, an de young &#8217;un &#8217;lowed he could shif some o&#8217; his wuk on to de New Han&#8217;.

Sam and he fader come a-runnin, an was mighty exprised when dey seen de young-lookin man in de place of de ole limpin man. But de New Han&#8217; wouldn't say nuffin &#8217;bout it. So dey jest shet up, an things carried on same as usual till de ole man he got word his mudder very bad, an he must start right off fur to see her. Befo he go he dun tole Sam not fur to ac obstropolus wid de New Han&#8217;, case ef he did, so sho&#8217; would he git a clubbin soon ez he got back. But Sam he forgit jes so soon de ole man gone, an behave wery overbearin an obstropolus.</p>  
<p>Finally de New Han&#8217; say to Sam, 'Ef you don&#8217; quit behavin, I&#8217;se gwine to leave when my yeah up, an dat's to-morrer.'</p>  
<p>Den Sam ac real owdashus, an tole him, 'Go along now, yo fool.'</p>

Well, de wery nex day &#8217;long come de man what was made young an likely by de New Han&#8217;, an &#8217;long wid him come he ole woman totin a baskit wid a elegant fat possum an sweet taters dat fairly made Sam mouf water. After passin de time o&#8217; day an so on, de man ax arter de New Han&#8217;, sayin he want him fix up de ole woman same like he do him.</p>

<p>But de man too smart fur dat, an wouldn&#8217; leave hit.</p>  
<p>So Sam &#8217;fraid he gwine to lose de possum, so he say, 'De New Han&#8217; dun gone off fur to see he sic fader, an dun tole me fo&#8217; he go for to ax you an do same what he done to you.'</p>
