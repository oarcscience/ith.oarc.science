### No. 63.--The Black Lady

A young girl goes to service at an old castle with the Black Lady, who
warns her not to look through the window. The Black Lady goes out. The
girl gets bored, looks through the window, and sees the Black Lady
playing cards with the devil. She falls down frightened. The Black Lady
comes in and asks her what she has seen. 'Nothing saw I; nought can I
say. Leave me alone; I am weary of my life.' The Black Lady beats her,
and asks her again, What saw you through the window?' 'Nothing saw I,'
etc. The girl runs off and meets a keeper, who takes her home, and after
some years marries her. She has a child, and is bedded. Enter the Black
Lady. 'What saw you through the window?' 'Nothing saw I,' etc. The Black
Lady takes the child, dashes its brains out, and exit. Enter the
husband. The wife offers no explanation, and the husband wants to burn
her, but his mother intercedes and saves her this time. But the same
thing happens again, and the husband makes a fire. As she is being
brought to the stake, the Black Lady comes. 'What saw you through the
window?' 'Nothing saw I,' etc. 'Take her and burn her,' says the Black
Lady. They fasten her up, and bring a light. The same question, the same
answer. The Black Lady sees that she is secret, so gives her back her
.two children, and leaves her in peace.
