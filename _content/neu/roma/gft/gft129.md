### No. 69.--The Fool with the Sheep

The youngest of three brothers is a fool, and the two others want to
kill him. They induce him to get into a sack as the way to go to heaven.
He does so, and they take him to the sea. They stop for a drink at a
tavern. A stranger comes by with sheep. *He* wants to go, and takes
Jack's place, and is thrown into the sea. Jack returns with the sheep.
The brothers find him at home with his flock, and ask where he got them.
'At the bottom of the sea.' They want to go too, so Jack throws them in,
and returns home.

<span class="small">One of the Boswells remarked to me twenty odd years
ago, 'The folks hereabouts are a lot of *rátfalo* heathens; they all
think they are going to heaven in a sack.' Our story is a very
widespread one, A Polish-Gypsy fragment of it was printed as a specimen
by Kopernicki (*Gypsy Lore Journal*, iii. 132); and it occurs also in
Grimm ('The Little Peasant,' No. 61, i. 264, 422), Campbell of Islay
('The Three Widows,'</span>

class="small">No. 39, ii. 218-238; *cf*. R. Köhler thereon in *Orient
and Occident*, ii. 1864, pp. 486-506), and Straparola (Venice, 1550:
'Scarpafigo,' i. 3), besides which Clouston (ii. 229-288, 489-91) cites
Irish, English, Norse, Danish, Icelandic, Burgundian, Gascon, Sicilian,
Modern Greek, Kabyle, Indian, and other versions. He could not of course
give two excellent versions from A. Campbell's *Santal Folk-tales*
(1891)--'The Story of Bitaram,' pp. 25-32, and 'The Greatest Cheat of
Seven,' pp. 98-101. In the first, which has features of Grimm's
'Thumbling' (No. 37) and 'Frederick and Catherine' (No. 59), Bitaram,
who is only a span high, by measuring money in a *paila* and leaving
some coins sticking in it, deludes the king and his sons into killing
all their cattle and firing their houses so as likewise to grow rich by
the sale of the hides and the ashes. They resolve to drown him, put him
in a bag, and carry him to the river, then go to a little distance to
cook their food. Bitaram tells a herd-boy that they are going to marry
him against his will; the herd-boy takes his place; and the story ends
exactly as in the European versions, only with cows and buffaloes in
place of sheep. In the second story the rivals are induced to purchase a
' magic' fishing-rod and a ' marvellous' dog, to burn their houses, and
to kill their wives. The occurrence of this story, as of others already
cited, among the aboriginal Santals of India is exceedingly curious. Is
it perhaps to be explained by the frequent mention in the collection of
Doms (= Roms = Gypsies)? Cornelius Price's whole story of 'Jack the
Robber' is a combination of 'The Master Thief' and 'The Little Peasant,'
such as meets us also in Hahn's Greek story of 'Beauty and the Dragon'
(No. 3, i. 75-79; ii. 178-186).</span>
