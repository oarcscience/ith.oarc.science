<p>Twenty to thirty years ago I knew hundreds of Gypsies in most parts of England and Wales. But the R&oacute;mani dialect was in those days my all-in-all; I would walk or ride thirty miles, and feel richly rewarded if I came back with two or three new words, such as <i>morm&uacute;ssi</i>, midwife, or <i>taltor&aacute;iro</i>, crow. I knew little or nothing about folklore, and cared less; the few stray odds and ends of it that I picked up among the people are scattered mostly through my <i>In Gypsy Tents</i> (Edinb. 1880). At Virginia Water, in 1872, I remember old Matty Cooper telling me how the plaice went about calling out, 'I'm the King of the Fishes,' which was why her mouth was made crooked (<i>cf</i>. Grimm's No. 172, The Sole'); and from a Boswell in, I think, 1875, I got the lying story of 'Happy Boz&#8217;ll,' which I give here, <A HREF="gft096.htm#an_36">No. 36</A>. But my one great find was my lighting on the Welsh-Gypsy harper, John Roberts (1815-94), of Newtown in Montgomeryshire. <i>In Gypsy Tents</i> contains a great deal about him and by him (pp. 78-81, 94-99, 149-158, 197-216, 269-278, 290-294, 299-319, 372-377) here, then, it may suffice to say that, though not a full-blooded Gypsy, he could speak R&oacute;mani, yes, and write R&oacute;mani, as no other Gypsy I have ever met at home or on the Continent. I know, indeed, of no other instance where the teller of folk-tales has also been able himself to transcribe them. He wrote out for me the two long folk-tales reprinted here (Nos. 54 and 55), and he had a wealth of others: I fear that many of them have perished with him. He was one of the finest of Welsh harpers; he spoke Welsh, English, and R&oacute;mani with equal fluency; and he was a man besides of rare intelligence. His tales, he would have it, were all derived from the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, 'leastwise if it was not from my poor old mother, or else from my grandmother, and she was a wonderful woman for telling stories.'</p>
