<p><A NAME="xref_0a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">0a</FONT></A> The reason why Gipsy words have been kept unchanged was fully illustrated one day in a Gipsy camp in my hearing, when one man declaring of a certain word that it was only <i>kennick</i> or slang, and not &#8220;Rommanis,&#8221; added, &#8220;It can&#8217;t be Rommanis, because everybody knows it. When a word gets to be known to everybody, it&#8217;s no longer Rommanis.&#8221;</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_1"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT></A> Lavengro and the Rommany Rye: London, John Murray.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT></A> To these I would add &#8220;Zelda&#8217;s Fortune,&#8221; now publishing in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_21"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT></A> Educated Chinese often exercise themselves in what they call &#8220;handsome talkee,&#8221; or &#8220;talkee leeson&#8221; (i.e., reason), by sitting down and uttering, by way of assertion and rejoinder, all the learned and wise sentences which they can recall. In their conversation and on their crockery, before every house and behind every counter, the elegant formula makes its appearance, teaching people not merely <i>how</i> to think, but what should be thought, and when.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_24"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT></A> Probably from the modern Greek &#960;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#957;&#945;, the sole of the foot, <i>i.e</i>., a track. Panth, a road, Hindustani.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_26"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT></A> Pott: &#8220;Die Zigeuner in Europa and Asien,&#8221; vol. ii, p. 293.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_30"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT></A> Two hundred (shel) years growing, two hundred years losing his coat, two hundred years before he dies, and then he loses all his blood and is no longer good.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_32"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT></A> The words of the Gipsy, as I took them down from his own lips, were as follows:&#8212;</p>  
<p>&#8220;Bawris are kushto habben. You can latcher adusta &#8217;pr&eacute; the bors. When they&#8217;re pirraben pauli the puvius, or tale the koshters, they&#8217;re kek kushti habben. The kushtiest are sovven s&#257;r the wen. Lel&#8217;em and tove &#8217;em and chiv &#8217;em adr&eacute;e the k&aacute;vi, with panny an&#8217; a bitti lun. The simmun&#8217;s kushto for the yellow jaundice.&#8221;</p>  
<p>I would remind the reader that in <i>every instance</i> where the original Gipsy language is given, it was written down or <i>noted</i> during conversation, and subsequently written out and read to a Gipsy, by whom it was corrected. And I again beg the reader to remember, that every Rommany phrase is followed by a translation into English.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_33"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT></A> Dr Pott intimates that <i>scharos</i>, a globe, may be identical with <i>sherro</i>, a head. When we find, however, that in German Rommany <i>tscharo</i> means goblet, pitcher, vessel, and in fact cup, it seems as if the Gipsy had hit upon the correct derivation.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_34"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT></A> &#8220;Dov&oacute;s yect o&#8217; the covvos that saw foki jins. When you lel a wart &#8217;pr&eacute; tut&eacute;s wasters you j&#257;l &#8217;pr&eacute; the drum or &#8217;dr&eacute;e the puvius till you latcher a kaulo bawris&#8212;yeck o&#8217; the boro kind with kek ker apr&eacute; him, an&#8217; del it apr&eacute; the c&#257;ro of a kaulo kosh in the bor, and ear the bawris mullers, yeck divvus p&#257;uli the w&#257;ver for sht&#257;r or pange divvuses the wart&#8217;ll kinner away-us. &#8217;Dusta chairusses I&#8217;ve pukkered dovo to Gorgios, an&#8217; Gorgios have kaired it, an&#8217; the warts have yuzhered avree their wasters.&#8221;</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_35"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT></A> Among certain tribes in North America, tobacco is both burned before and smoked &#8220;unto&#8221; the Great Spirit.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_38"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT></A> This word palindrome, though Greek, is intelligible to every Gipsy. In both languages it means &#8220;back on the road.&#8221;</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_53"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT></A> The Krallis&#8217;s Gav, King&#8217;s Village, a term also applied to Windsor.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_65"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT></A> Pronounced c&uacute;v-vas, like <i>covers</i> without the <i>r</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_70"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT></A> The Lord&#8217;s Prayer in pure English Gipsy:&#8212;</p>  
<p>&#8220;Moro Dad, savo djives oteh drey o charos, te caumen Gorgio ta Rommanny chal tiro nav, te awel tiro tem, te kairen tiro lav aukko prey puv, sar kairdios oteh drey o charos.

Tiro se o tem, mi-duvel, tiro o zoozlu vast, tiro sor koskopen drey sor cheros. Avali. Tachipen.&#8221;</p>  
<p>Specimens of old English Gipsy, preserving grammatical forms, may be found in Bright&#8217;s Hungary (Appendix). London, 1818. I call attention to the fact that all the specimens of the language which I give in this book simply represent <i>the modern and greatly corrupted</i> Rommany of the roads, which has, however, assumed a peculiar form of its own.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_75"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT></A> In gipsy <i>chores</i> would mean swindles. In America it is applied to small jobs.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_81"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT></A> Vide chapter x.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_83"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT></A> This should be <i>Bengo-tem</i> or devil land, but the Gipsy who gave me the word declared it was <i>bongo</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_110"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT></A> In English: &#8220;Water is the Great God, and it is Bishnoo or Vishnoo because it falls from God. <i>Vishnu is then the Great God</i>?&#8221; &#8220;Yes; there can be no forced meaning there, can there, sir? Duvel (God) is Duvel all the world over; but correctly speaking, Vishnu is God&#8217;s blood&#8212;I have heard that many times. And the snow is feathers that fall from the angels&#8217; wings. And what I said, that Bishnoo is God&#8217;s Blood is old Gipsy, and known by all our people.&#8221;</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_112"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">112</FONT></A> &#8220;Simurgh&#8212;a fabulous bird, <i>a griffin</i>.&#8221;&#8212;<i>Brice&#8217;s Hindustani Dictionary</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_124"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">124</FONT></A> Romi in Coptic signifies <i>a man</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_127"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">127</FONT></A> Since writing the above I have been told that among many Hindus &#8220;(good) evening&#8221; is the common greeting at any time of the day. And more recently still, meeting a gentleman who during twelve years in India had paid especial attention to all the dialects, I greeted him, as an experiment, with &#8220;Sarisham!&#8221; He replied, &#8216;Why, that&#8217;s more elegant than common Hindu&#8212;it&#8217;s Persian!&#8221; &#8220;Sarisham&#8221; is, in fact, still in use in India, as among the Gipsies. And as the latter often corrupt it into <i>sha&#8217;sh&#257;n</i>, so the vulgar Hindus call it &#8220;sh&#257;n!&#8221; Sarishan means in Gipsy, &#8220;How are you?&#8221; but its affinity with <i>sarisham</i> is evident.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_133"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">133</FONT></A> Miklosich (&#8220;Uber die Mundarten de der Zigeuner,&#8221; Wien, 1872) gives, it is true, 647 Rommany words of Slavonic origin, but many of these are also Hindustani. Moreover, Dr Miklosich treats as Gipsy words numbers of Slavonian words which Gipsies in Slavonian lands have Rommanised, but which are not generally Gipsy.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_171"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">171</FONT></A> Fortune-telling.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_189"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">189</FONT></A> In Egypt, as in Syria, every child is more or less marked by tattooing. Infants of the first families, even among Christians, are thus stamped.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_206"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">206</FONT></A> The Royston rook or crow has a greyish-white back, but is with this exception entirely black.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_209"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">209</FONT></A> The peacock and turkey are called lady-birds in Rommany, because, as a Gipsy told me, &#8220;they spread out their clothes, and hold up their heads and look fine, and walk proud, like great ladies.&#8221; I have heard a swan called a pauno r&#257;ni chillico&#8212;a white lady-bird.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_210"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">210</FONT></A> To make skewers is a common employment among the poorer English Gipsies.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_213"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">213</FONT></A> This rhyme and metre (such as they are) were purely accidental with my narrator; but as they occurred <i>verb. et lit</i>., I set them down.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_218"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">218</FONT></A> This story is well known to most &#8220;travellers.&#8221; It is also true, the &#8220;hero&#8221; being a <i>pash-and-pash</i>, or half-blood Rommany chal, whose name was told to me.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_219"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">219</FONT></A> The reader will find in Lord Lytton&#8217;s &#8220;Harold&#8221; mention of an Anglo-Saxon superstition very similar to that embodied in the story of the Seven Whistlers. This story is, however, entirely Gipsy.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_221a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">221a</FONT></A> This, which is a common story among the English Gipsies, and told exactly in the words here given, is implicitly believed in by them. Unfortunately, the terrible legends, but too well authenticated, of the persecutions to which their ancestors were subjected, render it very probable that it may have occurred as narrated. When Gipsies were hung and transported merely for <i>being</i> Gipsies, it is not unlikely that a persecution to death may have originated in even such a trifle as the alleged theft of a dish-clout.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_221b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">221b</FONT></A> Although they bear it with remarkable <i>apparent</i> indifference, Gipsies are in reality extremely susceptible to being looked at or laughed at.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_235"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">235</FONT></A> This story was told me in a Gipsy tent near Brighton, and afterwards repeated by one of the auditors while I transcribed it.</p>  </div>  </BODY>
