<P>
This page links together resources at Intangible Textual Heritage about the
folklore of the Roma people.
Also known as 'Gypsies', the Roma are nomads who originated in
India during the middle ages, and spread across a wide section of
Eurasia, preserving a unique culture and language.

NOTE: The term Gypsy was applied to the Roma by outsiders,
possibly in the mistaken belief that they were Egyptian in origin.
Some people today take it to be pejorative, and at the very least
its use is deprecated.
Nevertheless, it is used widely in the literature, particularly the
pre-1922 public domain books at this site, by scholars who cannot be
construed as using it in a derogative sense.
In new material at this site we use the term 'Roma' and
leave the term 'Gypsy' in existing documents.
