    CHAPTER XXXI

    How at a great feast that King Mark made an harper
    came and sang the lay that Dinadan had made.


    NOW will we pass of this matter, and speak we of the
    harpers that Sir Launcelot and Sir Dinadan had sent into
    Cornwall.  And at the great feast that King Mark made
    for joy that the Sessoins were put out of his country, then
    came Eliot the harper with the lay that Dinadan had made
    and secretly brought it unto Sir Tristram, and told him
    the lay that Dinadan had made by King Mark.  And
    when Sir Tristram heard it, he said:  O Lord Jesu, that
    Dinadan can make wonderly well and ill, thereas it shall
    be.  Sir, said Eliot, dare I sing this song afore King Mark?
    Yea, on my peril, said Sir Tristram, for I shall be thy
    warrant.  Then at the meat came in Eliot the harper, and
    because he was a curious harper men heard him sing the
    same lay that Dinadan had made, the which spake the
    most villainy by King Mark of his treason that ever man
    heard.

    When the harper had sung his song to the end King
    Mark was wonderly wroth, and said:  Thou harper, how
    durst thou be so bold on thy head to sing this song afore
    me.  Sir, said Eliot, wit you well I am a minstrel, and I
    must do as I am commanded of these lords that I bear the
    arms of.  And sir, wit ye well that Sir Dinadan, a knight
    of the Table Round, made this song, and made me to
    sing it afore you.  Thou sayest well, said King Mark,
    and because thou art a minstrel thou shalt go quit, but I
    charge thee hie thee fast out of my sight.  So the harper
    departed and went to Sir Tristram, and told him how he
    had sped.  Then Sir Tristram let make letters as goodly
    as he could to Launcelot and to Sir Dinadan.  And so he
    let conduct the harper out of the country.  But to say
    that King Mark was wonderly wroth, he was, for he
    deemed that the lay that was sung afore him was made by
    Sir Tristram's counsel, wherefore he thought to slay him
    and all his well-willers in that country.
