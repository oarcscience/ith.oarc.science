CHAPTER XXV

How Sir Tristram and Isoud were in prison, and how he
fought for her beauty, and smote of another lady's head.

THUS as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison, it happed
a knight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer
them.  I have marvel, said Tristram unto the knight and the lady,
what is the cause the lord of this castle holdeth us in prison:
it was never the custom of no <320>place of worship that ever I
came in, when a knight and a lady asked harbour, and they to
receive them, and after to destroy them that be his guests.  Sir,
said the knight, this is the old custom of this castle, that when
a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our lord, and he
that is weaker must lose his head.  And when that is done, if his
lady that he bringeth be fouler than our lord's wife, she must
lose her head: and if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then
shall the lady of this castle lose her head.  So God me help,
said Sir Tristram, this is a foul custom and a shameful.  But one
advantage have I, said Sir Tristram, I have a lady is fair
enough, fairer saw I never in all my life-days, and I doubt not
for lack of beauty she shall not lose her head; and rather than I
should lose my head I will fight for it on a fair field. 
Wherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord that I will be
ready as to-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle, if it be
so I may have my horse and mine armour.  Sir, said that knight, I
undertake that your desire shall be sped right well.  And then he
said:  Take your rest, and look that ye be up betimes and make
you ready and your lady, for ye shall want no thing that you
behoveth.  And therewith he departed, and on the morn betimes
that same knight came to Sir Tristram, and fetched him out and
his lady, and brought him horse and armour that was his own, and
bade him make him ready to the field, for all the estates and
commons of that lordship were there ready to behold that battle
and judgment.

Then came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in
his hand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: 
For an thy lady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my
lady's head; and if my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I
must strike off her head.  And if I may win thee, yet shall thy
lady be mine, and thou shalt lose thy head.  Sir, said Tristram,
this is a foul custom and horrible; and rather than my lady
should lose her head, yet had I liefer lose my head.  Nay, nay,
said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed together, and
the one shall have her judgment.  Nay, I <321>will not so, said
Sir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. 
But I doubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine,
and that will I prove and make good with my hand.  And whosomever
he be that will say the contrary I will prove it on his head. 
And therewith Sir Tristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her
thrice about with his naked sword in his hand.  And when Sir
Breunor saw that, he did the same wise turn his lady.  But when
Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him thought he saw never a
fairer lady, and then he dread his lady's head should be off. 
And so all the people that were there present gave judgment that
La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made.  How now,
said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should
lose her head, but because thou and she of long time have used
this wicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and
ladies been destroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy
you both.  So God me help, said Sir Breunor, for to say the
sooth, thy lady is fairer than mine, and that me sore repenteth. 
And so I hear the people privily say, for of all women I saw none
so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt slay my lady, I doubt not
but I shall slay thee and have thy lady.  Thou shalt win her,
said Sir Tristram, as dear as ever knight won lady.  And because
of thine own judgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if
that she had been fouler, and because of the evil custom, give me
thy lady, said Sir Tristram.  And therewithal Sir Tristram strode
unto him and took his lady from him, and with an awk stroke he
smote off her head clean.  Well, knight, said Sir Breunor, now
hast thou done me a despite; [*8]now take thine horse: sithen I
am ladyless I will win thy lady an I may.
