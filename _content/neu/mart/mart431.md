    CHAPTER II

    How the queen commanded Sir Launcelot to avoid the court,
    and of the sorrow that Launcelot made.


    ALL this while the queen stood still and let Sir Launcelot
    say what he would.  And when he had all said she brast
    out a-weeping, and so she sobbed and wept a great while.
    And when she might speak she said:  Launcelot, now I
    well understand that thou art a false recreant knight and
    a common lecher, and lovest and holdest other ladies, and
    by me thou hast disdain and scorn.  For wit thou well,
    she said, now I understand thy falsehood, and therefore
    shall I never love thee no more.  And never be thou so
    hardy to come in my sight; and right here I discharge
    thee this court, that thou never come within it; and I
    forfend thee my fellowship, and upon pain of thy head
    that thou see me no more.  Right so Sir Launcelot departed
    with great heaviness, that unnethe he might sustain
    himself for great dole-making.

    Then he called Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir
    Lionel, and told them how the queen had forfended him
    the court, and so he was in will to depart into his own
    country.  Fair sir, said Sir Bors de Ganis, ye shall not
    depart out of this land by mine advice.  Ye must remember
    in what honour ye are renowned, and called the
    noblest knight of the world; and many great matters ye
    have in hand.  And women in their hastiness will do
    ofttimes that sore repenteth them; and therefore by mine
    advice ye shall take your horse, and ride to the good
    hermitage here beside Windsor, that sometime was a good
    knight, his name is Sir Brasias, and there shall ye abide
    till I send you word of better tidings.  Brother, said Sir
    Launcelot, wit ye well I am full loath to depart out of
    this realm, but the queen hath defended me so highly,
    that meseemeth she will never be my good lady as she
    hath been.  Say ye never so, said Sir Bors, for many
    times or this time she hath been wroth with you, and
    after it she was the first that repented it.  Ye say well,
    said Launcelot, for now will I do by your counsel, and
    take mine horse and my harness, and ride to the hermit
    Sir Brasias, and there will I repose me until I hear some
    manner of tidings from you; but, fair brother, I pray
    you get me the love of my lady, Queen Guenever, an ye
    may Sir, said Sir Bors, ye need not to move me of such
    matters, for well ye wot I will do what I may to please
    you.

    And then the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, departed
    with right heavy cheer suddenly, that none earthly creature
    wist of him, nor where he was become, but Sir Bors.  So
    when Sir Launcelot was departed, the queen outward
    made no manner of sorrow in showing to none of his
    blood nor to none other.  But wit ye well, inwardly, as
    the book saith, she took great thought, but she bare it
    out with a proud countenance as though she felt nothing
    nor danger.
