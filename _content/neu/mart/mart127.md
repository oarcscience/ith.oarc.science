    CHAPTER IX

    How the damosel again rebuked Beaumains, and would not
    suffer him to sit at her table, but called him kitchen boy.

    AND ever she rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him to sit
    at her table, but as the Green Knight took him and sat him at a
    side table.  Marvel methinketh, said the Green Knight to the
    damosel, why ye rebuke this noble knight as ye do, for I warn
    you, damosel, he is a full noble knight, and I know no knight is
    able to match him; therefore ye do great wrong to rebuke him, for
    he shall do you right good service, for whatsomever he maketh
    himself, ye shall prove at the end that he is come of a noble
    blood and of king's lineage.  Fie, fie, said the damosel, it is
    shame for you to say of him such worship.  Truly, said the Green
    Knight, it were shame for me to say of him any disworship, for he
    hath proved himself a better knight than I am, yet have I met
    with many knights in my days, and never or this time have I found
    no knight his match.  And so that night they yede unto rest, and
    all that night the Green Knight commanded thirty knights privily
    to watch Beaumains, for to keep him from all treason.

    And so on the morn they all arose, and heard their mass and brake
    their fast; and then they took their horses and rode on their
    way, and the Green Knight conveyed them through the forest; and
    there the Green Knight said, My lord Beaumains, I and these
    thirty knights shall be always at your summons, both early and
    late, at your calling and whither that ever ye will send us.  It
    is well said, said Beaumains; when that I call upon you ye must
    yield you unto King Arthur, and all your knights.  If <224>that
    ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times, said the Green
    Knight.  Fie, fie upon thee, in the devil's name, said the
    damosel, that any good knights should be obedient unto a kitchen
    knave.  So then departed the Green Knight and the damosel.  And
    then she said unto Beaumains, Why followest thou me, thou kitchen
    boy?  Cast away thy shield and thy spear, and flee away; yet I
    counsel thee betimes or thou shalt say right soon, alas; for wert
    thou as wight as ever was Wade or Launcelot, Tristram, or the
    good knight Sir Lamorak, thou shalt not pass a pass here that is
    called the Pass Perilous.  Damosel, said Beaumains, who is afeard
    let him flee, for it were shame to turn again sithen I have
    ridden so long with you.  Well, said the damosel, ye shall soon,
    whether ye will or not.
