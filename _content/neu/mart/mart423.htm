CHAPTER XVII

How Sir Launcelot returned towards Logris, and of other
adventures which he saw in the way.


THEN King Pelles came to Sir Launcelot and told him
tidings of his brother, whereof he was sorry, that he wist
not what to do.  So Sir Launcelot departed, and took his
arms, and said he would go see the realm of Logris,
which I have not seen in twelve months.  And there
with he commended the king to God, and so rode through
many realms.  And at the last he came to a white abbey,
and there they made him that night great cheer; and on
the morn he rose and heard mass.  And afore an altar
he found a rich tomb, which was newly made; and then
he took heed, and saw the sides written with gold which
said:  Here lieth King Bagdemagus of Gore, which King
Arthur's nephew slew; and named him, Sir Gawaine.
Then was not he a little sorry, for Launcelot loved him
much more than any other, and had it been any other
than Gawaine he should not have escaped from death to
life; and said to himself:  Ah Lord God, this is a great
hurt unto King Arthur's court, the loss of such a man.
And then he departed and came to the abbey where
Galahad did the adventure of the tombs, and won the
white shield with the red cross; and there had he great
cheer all that night.

And on the morn he turned unto Camelot, where he
found King Arthur and the queen.  But many of the
knights of the Round Table were slain and destroyed,
more than half.  And so three were come home, Ector,
Gawaine, and Lionel, and many other that need not to
be rehearsed.  And all the court was passing glad of Sir
Launcelot, and the king asked him many tidings of his
son Galahad.  And there Launcelot told the king of his
adventures that had befallen him since he departed.  And
also he told him of the adventures of Galahad, Percivale,
and Bors, which that he knew by the letter of the dead
damosel, and as Galahad had told him.  Now God would,
said the king, that they were all three here.  That shall
never be, said Launcelot, for two of them shall ye never
see, but one of them shall come again.

Now leave we this story and speak of Galahad.
