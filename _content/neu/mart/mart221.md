    CHAPTER XXVIII

    How Sir Tristram had a fall with Sir Palomides, and
    how Launcelot overthrew two knights.

    THEN they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides. 
    And within a while after there came a squire of the castle, that
    told Sir Pellounes that was lord of that castle, that a knight
    with a black shield had smitten down thirteen knights.  Fair
    brother, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides, let us cast upon us
    cloaks, and let us go see <400>the play.  Not so, said Sir
    Persides, we will not go like knaves thither, but we will ride
    like men and good knights to withstand our enemies.  So they
    armed them, and took their horses and great spears, and thither
    they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the
    tournament.  And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he
    sent a squire unto him and said:  Go thou to the yonder knight
    with the green shield and therein a lion of gold, and say him I
    require him to joust with me, and tell him that my name is Sir
    Palomides.  When Sir Persides understood that request of Sir
    Palomides, he made him ready, and there anon they met together,
    but Sir Persides had a fall.  Then Sir Tristram dressed him to be
    revenged upon Sir Palomides, and that saw Sir Palomides that was
    ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and took him at an advantage
    and smote him over his horse's tail when he had no spear in his
    rest.  Then stert up Sir Tristram and took his horse lightly, and
    was wroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall.  Then
    Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed
    him to joust with him at his request.  Nay, said Sir Palomides,
    as at this time I will not joust with that knight, for I know him
    better than he weeneth.  And if he be wroth he may right it to-
    morn at the Castle of Maidens, where he may see me and many other
    knights.

    With that came Sir Dinadan, and when he saw Sir Tristram wroth he
    list not to jape.  Lo, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be
    a man never so good yet may he have a fall, and he was never so
    wise but he might be overseen, and he rideth well that never
    fell.  So Sir Tristram was passing wroth, and said to Sir
    Persides and to Sir Dinadan:  I will revenge me.  Right so as
    they stood talking there, there came by Sir Tristram a likely
    knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a black shield. 
    What knight is that? said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides.  I know
    him well, said Sir Persides, for his name is Sir Briant of North
    Wales; so he passed on among other knights of North Wales.  And
    there came <401>in Sir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the
    arms of Cornwall, and he sent a squire unto Sir Briant, and
    required him to joust with him.  Well, said Sir Briant, sithen I
    am required to joust I will do what I may; and there Sir
    Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his horse a great fall.  And
    then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he was that bare the
    shield of Cornwall.  Whatsoever he be, said Sir Dinadan, I
    warrant you he is of King Ban's blood, the which be knights of
    the most noble prowess in the world, for to account so many for
    so many.  Then there came two knights of Northgalis, that one
    hight Hew de la Montaine, and the other Sir Madok de la Montaine,
    and they challenged Sir Launcelot foot-hot.  Sir Launcelot not
    refusing them but made him ready, with one spear he smote them
    down both over their horses' croups; and so Sir Launcelot rode
    his way.  By the good lord, said Sir Tristram, he is a good
    knight that beareth the shield of Cornwall, and meseemeth he
    rideth in the best manner that ever I saw knight ride.

    Then the King of Northgalis rode unto Sir Palomides and prayed
    him heartily for his sake to joust with that knight that hath
    done us of Northgalis despite.  Sir, said Sir Palomides, I am
    full loath to have ado with that knight, and cause why is, for as
    to-morn the great tournament shall be; and therefore I will keep
    myself fresh by my will.  Nay, said the King of Northgalis, I
    pray you require him of jousts.  Sir, said Sir Palomides, I will
    joust at your request, and require that knight to joust with me,
    and often I have seen a man have a fall at his own request.
