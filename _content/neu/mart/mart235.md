    CHAPTER XLII

    How Sir Tristram took with him the shield, and also how
    he slew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.

    SO then Sir Tristram took his leave of the queen, and took the
    shield with him.  Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le
    Fay, his name was Sir Hemison, and he made him ready to follow
    Sir Tristram.  Fair friend, said Morgan, ride not after that
    knight, for ye shall not win no worship of him.  Fie on him,
    coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist never good knight come out
    of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de Liones.  What an that
    be he? said she.  Nay, nay, said he, he is with La Beale Isoud,
    and this is but a daffish knight.  Alas, my fair friend, ye shall
    find him the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him
    better than ye do.  For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay
    him.  Ah, fair friend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will
    follow that knight, for I fear me sore of your again coming. 
    With this this knight rode his way wood wroth, and he rode after
    Sir Tristram as fast as he had been chased with knights.  When
    Sir Tristram heard a knight come after him so fast he returned
    about, and saw a knight coming against him.  And when he came
    nigh to Sir Tristram he cried on high:  Sir knight, keep thee
    from me.  Then they rushed together as it had been thunder, and
    Sir Hemison brised his spear upon Sir Tristram, but his harness
    was so good that he might not <430>hurt him.  And Sir Tristram
    smote him harder, and bare him through the body, and he fell over
    his horse's croup.  Then Sir Tristram turned to have done more
    with his sword, but he saw so much blood go from him that him
    seemed he was likely to die, and so he departed from him and came
    to a fair manor to an old knight, and there Sir Tristram lodged.
