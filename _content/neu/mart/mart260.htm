CHAPTER XXIII

How Sir Percivale was made knight of King Arthur, and
how a dumb maid spake, and brought him to the
Round Table.


NOW turn we again unto Sir Lamorak, and speak we of
his brethren, Sir Tor, which was King Pellinore's first son
and begotten of Aryes, wife of the cowherd, for he was a
bastard; and Sir Aglovale was his first son begotten in
wedlock; Sir Lamorak, Dornar, Percivale, these were his
sons too in wedlock.  So when King Mark and Sir Tristram
were departed from the court there was made great
dole and sorrow for the departing of Sir Tristram.  Then
the king and his knights made no manner of joys eight days
after.  And at the eight days' end there came to the court
a knight with a young squire with him.  And when this
knight was unarmed, he went to the king and required him
to make the young squire a knight.  Of what lineage is he
come? said King Arthur.  Sir, said the knight, he is the
son of King Pellinore, that did you some time good service,
and he is a brother unto Sir Lamorak de Galis, the good
knight.  Well, said the king, for what cause desire ye that
of me that I should make him knight?  Wit you well, my
lord the king, that this young squire is brother to me as
well as to Sir Lamorak, and my name is Aglavale.  Sir
Aglavale, said Arthur, for the love of Sir Lamorak, and
for his father's love, he shall be made knight to-morrow.
Now tell me, said Arthur, what is his name?  Sir, said
the knight, his name is Percivale de Galis.  So on the
morn the king made him knight in Camelot.  But the
king and all the knights thought it would be long or that
he proved a good knight.

Then at the dinner, when the king was set at the table,
and every knight after he was of prowess, the king
commanded him to be set among mean knights; and so was
Sir Percivale set as the king commanded.  Then was
there a maiden in the queen's court that was come of high
blood, and she was dumb and never spake word.  Right
so she came straight into the hall, and went unto Sir
Percivale, and took him by the hand and said aloud, that
the king and all the knights might hear it:  Arise, Sir
Percivale, the noble knight and God's knight, and go with
me; and so he did.  And there she brought him to the
right side of the Siege Perilous, and said, Fair knight, take
here thy siege, for that siege appertaineth to thee and to
none other.  Right so she departed and asked a priest.
And as she was confessed and houselled then she died.
Then the king and all the court made great joy of Sir
Percivale.
