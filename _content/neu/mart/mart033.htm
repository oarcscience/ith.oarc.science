CHAPTER VII

How a dwarf reproved Balin for the death of Lanceor, and how King
Mark of Cornwall found them, and made a tomb over them.

Now go we hence, said Balin, and well be we met.  The meanwhile
as they talked, there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot on
horseback, as much as he might; and found the dead bodies,
wherefore he made great dole, and pulled out his hair for sorrow,
and said, Which of you knights have done this deed?  Whereby
askest thou it? said Balan.  For I would wit it, said the dwarf. 
It was I, said Balin, that slew this knight in my defence, for
hither he came to chase me, and either I must slay him or he me;
and this damosel slew herself for his love, which repenteth me,
and for her sake I shall owe all women the better love.  Alas,
said the dwarf, thou hast done great damage unto thyself, for
this knight that is here dead was one of the most valiantest men
that lived, and trust well, Balin, the kin of this knight will
chase you through the world till they have slain you.  As for
that, said Balin, I fear not greatly, but I am right heavy that I
have displeased my lord King Arthur, for the death of this
knight.  So <59>as they talked together, there came a king of
Cornwall riding, the which hight King Mark.  And when he saw
these two bodies dead, and understood how they were dead, by the
two knights above said, then made the king great sorrow for the
true love that was betwixt them, and said, I will not depart till
I have on this earth made a tomb, and there he pight his
pavilions and sought through all the country to find a tomb, and
in a church they found one was fair and rich, and then the king
let put them both in the earth, and put the tomb upon them, and
wrote the names of them both on the tomb.  How here lieth Lanceor
the king's son of Ireland, that at his own request was slain by
the hands of Balin; and how his lady, Colombe, and paramour, slew
herself with her love's sword for dole and sorrow.
