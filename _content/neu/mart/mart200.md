    CHAPTER VI

    How Sir Launcelot fought with six knights, and after
    with Sir Brian, and how he delivered the prisoners.

    AH, said Sir Launcelot, that knight is my fellow, and him shall I
    rescue or else I shall lose my life therefore.  And therewithal
    he rode fast till he came before the Castle of Pendragon; and
    anon therewithal there came six knights, and all made them ready
    to set upon Sir Launcelot at once; then Sir Launcelot feutred his
    spear, and smote the <361>foremost that he brake his back in-
    sunder, and three of them hit and three failed.  And then Sir
    Launcelot passed through them, and lightly he turned in again,
    and smote another knight through the breast and throughout the
    back more than an ell, and therewithal his spear brake.  So then
    all the remnant of the four knights drew their swords and lashed
    at Sir Launcelot.  And at every stroke Sir Launcelot bestowed so
    his strokes that at four strokes sundry they avoided their
    saddles, passing sore wounded; and forthwithal he rode hurling
    into that castle.

    And anon the lord of the castle, that was that time cleped Sir
    Brian de les Isles, the which was a noble man and a great enemy
    unto King Arthur, within a while he was armed and upon horseback. 
    And then they feutred their spears and hurled together so
    strongly that both their horses rashed to the earth.  And then
    they avoided their saddles, and dressed their shields, and drew
    their swords, and flang together as wood men, and there were many
    strokes given in a while.  At the last Sir Launcelot gave to Sir
    Brian such a buffet that he kneeled upon his knees, and then Sir
    Launcelot rashed upon him, and with great force he pulled off his
    helm; and when Sir Brian saw that he should be slain he yielded
    him, and put him in his mercy and in his grace.  Then Sir
    Launcelot made him to deliver all his prisoners that he had
    within his castle, and therein Sir Launcelot found of Arthur's
    knights thirty, and forty ladies, and so he delivered them; and
    then he rode his way.  And anon as La Cote Male Taile was
    delivered he gat his horse, and his harness, and his damosel
    Maledisant.

    The meanwhile Sir Nerovens, that Sir Launcelot had foughten
    withal afore at the bridge, he sent a damosel after Sir Launcelot
    to wit how he sped at the Castle of Pendragon.  And then they
    within the castle marvelled what knight he was, when Sir Brian
    and his knights delivered all those prisoners.  Have ye no
    marvel, said the damosel, for the best knight in this world was
    here, and did this journey, and wit ye well, she said, it was Sir
    Launcelot.  Then was Sir Brian full glad, and so was his
    <362>lady, and all his knights, that such a man should win them. 
    And when the damosel and La Cote Male Taile understood that it
    was Sir Launcelot du Lake that had ridden with them in
    fellowship, and that she remembered her how she had rebuked him
    and called him coward, then was she passing heavy.
