CHAPTER XLII

How Sir Galahalt and Palomides fought together, and of Sir
Dinadan and Sir Galahalt.


HERE beginneth the second day.  Anon as Sir Palomides
came into the field, Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was at the
range end, and met with Sir Palomides, and he with him,
with great spears.  And then they came so hard together
that their spears all to-shivered, but Sir Galahalt smote
him so hard that he bare him backward over his horse,
but yet he lost not his stirrups.  Then they drew their
swords and lashed together many sad strokes, that many
worshipful knights left their business to behold them.
But at the last Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, smote a
stroke of might unto Palomides, sore upon the helm; but
the helm was so hard that the sword might not bite, but
slipped and smote off the head of the horse of Sir
Palomides.  When the haut prince wist and saw the good
knight fall unto the earth he was ashamed of that stroke.
And therewith he alighted down off his own horse, and
prayed the good knight, Palomides, to take that horse of
his gift, and to forgive him that deed.  Sir, said Palomides,
I thank you of your great goodness, for ever of a man of
worship a knight shall never have disworship; and so he
mounted upon that horse, and the haut prince had another
anon.  Now, said the haut prince, I release to you that
maiden, for ye have won her.  Ah, said Palomides, the
damosel and I be at your commandment.

So they departed, and Sir Galahalt did great deeds of
arms.  And right so came Dinadan and encountered with
Sir Galahalt, and either came to other so fast with their
spears that their spears brake to their hands.  But
Dinadan had weened the haut prince had been more weary
than he was.  And then he smote many sad strokes at the
haut prince; but when Dinadan saw he might not get
him to the earth he said:  My lord, I pray you leave me,
and take another.  The haut prince knew not Dinadan,
and left goodly for his fair words.  And so they departed;
but soon there came another and told the haut prince
that it was Dinadan.  Forsooth, said the prince, therefore
am I heavy that he is so escaped from me, for with his
mocks and japes now shall I never have done with him.
And then Galahalt rode fast after him, and bade him:
Abide, Dinadan, for King Arthur's sake.  Nay, said
Dinadan, so God me help, we meet no more together this
day.  Then in that wrath the haut prince met with Meliagaunce,
and he smote him in the throat that an he had
fallen his neck had broken; and with the same spear he
smote down another knight.  Then came in they of
Northgalis and many strangers, and were like to have put
them of Surluse to the worse, for Sir Galahalt, the haut
prince, had ever much in hand.  So there came the good
knight, Semound the Valiant, with forty knights, and he
beat them all aback.  Then the Queen Guenever and Sir
Launcelot let blow to lodging, and every knight unarmed
him, and dressed him to the feast.
