CHAPTER XIX
How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he came to the
castle the gates were closed against him, and of the
words that the lady said to him.

NOW turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Linet that he
might see her sister, his lady.  Sir, she said, I would fain ye
saw her.  Then Sir Beaumains all armed him, and took his horse
and his spear, and rode straight unto the castle.  And when he
came to the gate he found there many men armed, and pulled up the
drawbridge and drew the port close.

Then marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter.  And
then he looked up to the window; and there he saw the fair
Lionesse that said on high:  Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as
yet thou shalt not have wholly my love, unto the time that thou
be called one of the number of the worthy knights.  And therefore
go labour in worship this twelvemonth, and then thou shalt hear
new tidings.  Alas, fair lady, said Beaumains, I have not
deserved that ye should show me this strangeness, and I had
weened that I should have right good cheer with you, <243>and
unto my power I have deserved thank, and well I am sure I have
bought your love with part of the best blood within my body. 
Fair courteous knight, said Dame Lionesse, be not displeased nor
over-hasty; for wit you well your great travail nor good love
shall not be lost, for I consider your great travail and labour,
your bounty and your goodness as me ought to do.  And therefore
go on your way, and look that ye be of good comfort, for all
shall be for your worship and for the best, and perdy a
twelvemonth will soon be done, and trust me, fair knight, I shall
be true to you, and never to betray you, but to my death I shall
love you and none other.  And therewithal she turned her from the
window, and Sir Beaumains rode awayward from the castle, making
great dole, and so he rode here and there and wist not where he
rode, till it was dark night.  And then it happened him to come
to a poor man's house, and there he was harboured all that night.

But Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed and writhed for the
love of the lady of the castle.  And so upon the morrow he took
his horse and rode until underne, and then he came to a broad
water, and thereby was a great lodge, and there he alighted to
sleep and laid his head upon the shield, and betook his horse to
the dwarf, and commanded him to watch all night.

Now turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much
upon Beaumains, and then she called unto her Sir Gringamore her
brother, and prayed him in all manner, as he loved her heartily,
that he would ride after Sir Beaumains:  And ever have ye wait
upon him till ye may find him sleeping, for I am sure in his
heaviness he will alight down in some place, and lie him down to
sleep; and therefore have ye your wait upon him, and in the
priviest manner ye can, take his dwarf, and go ye your way with
him as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake.  For my sister
Linet telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come, and
what is his right name.  And the meanwhile I and my sister will
ride unto your castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf. 
And then when ye <244>have brought him unto your castle, I will
have him in examination myself.  Unto the time that I know what
is his right name, and of what kindred he is come, shall I never
be merry at my heart.  Sister, said Sir Gringamore, all this
shall be done after your intent.

And so he rode all the other day and the night till that he found
Sir Beaumains lying by a water, and his head upon his shield, for
to sleep.  And then when he saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he
came stilly stalking behind the dwarf, and plucked him fast under
his arm, and so he rode away with him as fast as ever he might
unto his own castle.  And this Sir Gringamore's arms were all
black, and that to him longeth.  But ever as he rode with the
dwarf toward his castle, he cried unto his lord and prayed him of
help.  And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he leapt
lightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his way with the
dwarf, and so Sir Gringamore rode out of his sight.
