    CHAPTER XIX

    How King Mark sent Sir Tristram for La Beale Isoud
    toward Ireland, and how by fortune he arrived into England.

    THEN when this was done King Mark cast always in his heart how he
    might destroy Sir Tristram.  And then he imagined in himself to
    send Sir Tristram into Ireland for La Beale Isoud.  For Sir
    Tristram had so praised her beauty and her goodness that King
    Mark said that he would wed her, whereupon he prayed Sir Tristram
    to take his way into Ireland for him on message.  And all this
    was done to the intent to slay Sir Tristram.  Notwithstanding,
    Sir Tristram would not refuse the message for no danger nor peril
    that might fall, for the pleasure of his uncle, but to go he made
    him ready in the most goodliest wise that might be devised.  For
    Sir Tristram took with him the most goodliest knights that he
    might find in the court; and they were arrayed, after the guise
    that was then used, in the goodliest manner.  So Sir Tristram
    departed and took the sea with all his fellowship.  And anon, as
    he was in the broad sea a tempest took him and his fellowship,
    and drove them back into the coast of England; and there they
    arrived fast by Camelot, and full fain they were to take the
    land.

    And when they were landed Sir Tristram set up his pavilion upon
    the land of Camelot, and there he let hang his shield upon the
    pavilion.  And that same day came two knights of King Arthur's,
    that one was Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Morganor.  And they
    touched the shield, and bade him come out of the pavilion for to
    joust, an he would joust.  Ye shall be answered, said Sir
    Tristram, an ye will tarry a little while.  So he made him ready,
    and first he smote down Sir Ector de Maris, and after he smote
    down Sir Morganor, all with one spear, and sore bruised them. 
    And when they lay upon the earth they asked Sir <311>Tristram
    what he was, and of what country he was knight.  Fair lords, said
    Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am of Cornwall.  Alas, said Sir
    Ector, now am I ashamed that ever any Cornish knight should
    overcome me.  And then for despite Sir Ector put off his armour
    from him, and went on foot, and would not ride.
