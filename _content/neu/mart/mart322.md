    CHAPTER LXXXV

    How Sir Tristram made him ready to rescue Sir Palomides,
    but Sir Launcelot rescued him or he came.


    WHEN Sir Tristram heard how Sir Palomides went to his
    death, he was heavy to hear that, and said:  Howbeit that
    I am wroth with Sir Palomides, yet will not I suffer him to
    die so shameful a death, for he is a full noble knight.  And
    then anon Sir Tristram was armed and took his horse and
    two squires with him, and rode a great pace toward the
    castle of Pelownes where Sir Palomides was judged to death.
    And these twelve knights that led Sir Palomides passed by
    a well whereas Sir Launcelot was, which was alighted there,
    and had tied his horse to a tree, and taken off his helm
    to drink of that well; and when he saw these knights, Sir
    Launcelot put on his helm and suffered them to pass by
    him.  And then was he ware of Sir Palomides bounden,
    and led shamefully to his death.  O Jesu, said Launcelot,
    what misadventure is befallen him that he is thus led
    toward his death?  Forsooth, said Launcelot, it were shame
    to me to suffer this noble knight so to die an I might help
    him, therefore I will help him whatsomever come of it,
    or else I shall die for Sir Palomides' sake.  And then Sir
    Launcelot mounted upon his horse, and gat his spear in
    his hand, and rode after the twelve knights that led Sir
    Palomides.  Fair knights, said Sir Launcelot, whither lead
    ye that knight? it beseemeth him full ill to ride bounden.
    Then these twelve knights suddenly turned their horses
    and said to Sir Launcelot:  Sir knight, we counsel thee not
    to meddle with this knight, for he hath deserved death, and
    unto death he is judged.  That me repenteth, said Launcelot,
    that I may not borrow him with fairness, for he is over
    good a knight to die such a shameful death.  And therefore,
    fair knights, said Sir Launcelot, keep you as well as
    ye can, for I will rescue that knight or die for it.

    Then they began to dress their spears, and Sir Launcelot
    smote the foremost down, horse and man, and so he served
    three more with one spear; and then that spear brast, and
    therewithal Sir Launcelot drew his sword, and then he
    smote on the right hand and on the left hand.  Then
    within a while he left none of those twelve knights, but he
    had laid them to the earth, and the most part of them
    were sore wounded.  And then Sir Launcelot took the
    best horse that he found, and loosed Sir Palomides and set
    him upon that horse; and so they returned again unto
    Joyous Gard, and then was Sir Palomides ware of Sir
    Tristram how he came riding.  And when Sir Launcelot
    saw him he knew him well, but Sir Tristram knew him not
    because Sir Launcelot had on his shoulder a golden shield.
    So Sir Launcelot made him ready to joust with Sir Tristram,
    that Sir Tristram should not ween that he were Sir
    Launcelot.  Then Sir Palomides cried aloud to Sir Tristram:
    O my lord, I require you joust not with this knight, for
    this good knight hath saved me from my death.  When
    Sir Tristram heard him say so he came a soft trotting pace
    toward them.  And then Sir Palomides said:  My lord,
    Sir Tristram, much am I beholding unto you of your great
    goodness, that would proffer your noble body to rescue me
    undeserved, for I have greatly offended you.  Notwithstanding,
    said Sir Palomides, here met we with this noble
    knight that worshipfully and manly rescued me from twelve
    knights, and smote them down all and wounded them sore.
