CHAPTER XII

How eleven kings gathered a great host against
King Arthur.


AND SO within a little space the three kings came unto the castle
of Bedegraine, and found there a passing fair fellowship, and
well beseen, whereof they had great joy, and victual they wanted
none.  This was the cause of the northern host: that they were
reared for the despite and rebuke the six kings had at Carlion. 
And those six kings by their means, gat unto them five other
kings; and thus they began to gather their people.

And now they sware that for weal nor woe, they should not leave
other, till they had destroyed Arthur.  And then they made an
oath.  The first that began the oath was the Duke of Cambenet,
that he would bring with him five thousand men of arms, the which
were ready on horseback.  Then sware King Brandegoris of
Stranggore that he would bring five thousand men of arms on
horseback.  Then sware King Clariance of Northumberland he would
bring three thousand men of arms.  Then sware the King of the <21
CHAP. XIII  OF A DREAM>Hundred Knights, that was a passing good
man and a young, that he would bring four thousand men of arms on
horseback.  Then there swore King Lot, a passing good knight, and
Sir Gawain's father, that he would bring five thousand men of
arms on horseback.  Also there swore King Urience, that was Sir
Uwain's father, of the land of Gore, and he would bring six
thousand men of arms on horseback.  Also there swore King Idres
of Cornwall, that he would bring five thousand men of arms on
horseback.  Also there swore King Cradelmas to bring five
thousand men on horseback.  Also there swore King Agwisance of
Ireland to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback.  Also
there swore King Nentres to bring five thousand men of arms on
horseback.  Also there swore King Carados to bring five thousand
men of arms on horseback.  So their whole host was of clean men
of arms on horseback fifty thousand, and a-foot ten thousand of
good men's bodies.  Then were they soon ready, and mounted upon
horse and sent forth their fore-riders, for these eleven kings in
their ways laid a siege unto the castle of Bedegraine; and so
they departed and drew toward Arthur, and left few to abide at
the siege, for the castle of Bedegraine was holden of King
Arthur, and the men that were therein were Arthur's.
