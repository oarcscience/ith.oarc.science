CHAPTER VI

How King Arthur had all the knights together for to joust
in the meadow beside Camelot or they departed.


Now, said the king, I am sure at this quest of the
Sangreal shall all ye of the Table Round depart, and never
shall I see you again whole together; therefore I will see
you all whole together in the meadow of Camelot to joust
and to tourney, that after your death men may speak of
it that such good knights were wholly together such a
day.  As unto that counsel and at the king's request
they accorded all, and took on their harness that longed
unto jousting.  But all this moving of the king was for
this intent, for to see Galahad proved; for the king
deemed he should not lightly come again unto the court
after his departing.  So were they assembled in the
meadow, both more and less.  Then Sir Galahad, by the
prayer of the king and the queen, did upon him a noble
jesseraunce, and also he did on his helm, but shield would
he take none for no prayer of the king.  And then Sir
Gawaine and other knights prayed him to take a spear.
Right so he did; and the queen was in a tower with all
her ladies, for to behold that tournament.  Then Sir
Galahad dressed him in midst of the meadow, and began
to break spears marvellously, that all men had wonder of
him; for he there surmounted all other knights, for
within a while he had defouled many good knights of the
Table Round save twain, that was Sir Launcelot and Sir
Percivale.
