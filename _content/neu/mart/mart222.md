    CHAPTER XXIX

    How Sir Launcelot jousted with Palomides and overthrew
    him, and after he was assailed with twelve knights.

    THEN Sir Palomides sent unto Sir Launcelot a squire, and required
    him of jousts.  Fair fellow, said Sir Launcelot, <402>tell me thy
    lord's name.  Sir, said the squire, my lord's name is Sir
    Palomides, the good knight.  In good hour, said Sir Launcelot,
    for there is no knight that I saw this seven years that I had
    liefer ado withal than with him.  And so either knights made them
    ready with two great spears.  Nay, said Sir Dinadan, ye shall see
    that Sir Palomides will quit him right well.  It may be so, said
    Sir Tristram, but I undertake that knight with the shield of
    Cornwall shall give him a fall.  I believe it not, said Sir
    Dinadan.  Right so they spurred their horses and feutred their
    spears, and either hit other, and Sir Palomides brake a spear
    upon Sir Launcelot, and he sat and moved not; but Sir Launcelot
    smote him so lightly that he made his horse to avoid the saddle,
    and the stroke brake his shield and the hauberk, and had he not
    fallen he had been slain.  How now, said Sir Tristram, I wist
    well by the manner of their riding both that Sir Palomides should
    have a fall.

    Right so Sir Launcelot rode his way, and rode to a well to drink
    and to repose him, and they of Northgalis espied him whither he
    rode; and then there followed him twelve knights for to have
    mischieved him, for this cause that upon the morn at the
    tournament of the Castle of Maidens that he should not win the
    victory.  So they came upon Sir Launcelot suddenly, and unnethe
    he might put upon him his helm and take his horse, but they were
    in hands with him; and then Sir Launcelot gat his spear, and rode
    through them, and there he slew a knight and brake a spear in his
    body.  Then he drew his sword and smote upon the right hand and
    upon the left hand, so that within a few strokes he had slain
    other three knights, and the remnant that abode he wounded them
    sore all that did abide.  Thus Sir Launcelot escaped from his
    enemies of North Wales, and then Sir Launcelot rode his way till
    a friend, and lodged him till on the morn; for he would not the
    first day have ado in the tournament
    because of his great labour.  And on the first day he was with
    King Arthur thereas he was set on high upon a scaffold to discern
    who was best worthy of his deeds.  So <403>Sir Launcelot was with
    King Arthur, and jousted not the first day.
