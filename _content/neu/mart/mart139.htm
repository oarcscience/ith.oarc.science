CHAPTER XXI

How Sir Gareth, otherwise called Beaumains, came to the
presence of his lady, and how they took acquaintance,
and of their love.

AND then came forth Dame Lionesse arrayed like a princess, and
there she made him passing good cheer, and he her again; and they
had goodly language and lovely countenance together.  And Sir
Gareth thought many times, Jesu, would that the lady of the
Castle Perilous were so fair as she was.  There were all manner
of games and plays, of dancing and singing.  And ever the more
Sir Gareth beheld that lady, the more he loved her; and so he
burned in love that he was past himself in his reason; and forth
toward night they yede unto supper, and Sir Gareth might not eat,
for his love was so hot that he wist not where he was.

All these looks espied Sir Gringamore, and then at-after supper
he called his sister Dame Lionesse into a chamber, and said: 
Fair sister, I have well espied your countenance betwixt you and
this knight, and I will, sister, that ye wit he is a full noble
knight, and if ye can make him to abide here I will do him all
the pleasure that I can, for an ye were better than ye are, ye
were well bywaryd upon him.  Fair brother, said Dame Lionesse, I
understand well that the knight is good, and come he is of a
noble house.  Notwithstanding, I will assay him better, howbeit I
am most beholden to him of any earthly man; for he hath had great
labour for my love, and passed many a dangerous passage.

Right so Sir Gringamore went unto Sir Gareth, and said, Sir, make
ye good cheer, for ye shall have none other cause, for this lady,
my sister, is yours at all times, her worship saved, for wit ye
well she loveth you as well as ye do her, and better if better
may be.  An I wist that, said Sir Gareth, there lived not a
gladder man than I <248>would be.  Upon my worship, said Sir
Gringamore, trust unto my promise; and as long as it liketh you
ye shall sojourn with me, and this lady shall be with us daily
and nightly to make you all the cheer that she can.  I will well,
said Sir Gareth, for I have promised to be nigh this country this
twelvemonth.  And well I am sure King Arthur and other noble
knights will find me where that I am within this twelvemonth. 
For I shall be sought and found, if that I be alive.  And then
the noble knight Sir Gareth went unto the Dame Lionesse, which he
then much loved, and kissed her many times, and either made great
joy of other.  And there she promised him her love certainly, to
love him and none other the days of her life.  Then this lady,
Dame Lionesse, by the assent of her brother, told Sir Gareth all
the truth what she was, and how she was the same lady that he did
battle for, and how she was lady of the Castle Perilous, and
there she told him how she caused her brother to take away his
dwarf, [*2]for this cause, to know the certainty what was your
name, and of what kin ye were come.
