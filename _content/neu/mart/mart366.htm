CHAPTER XIII

Of the adventure that Melias had, and how Galahad revenged
him, and how Melias was carried into an abbey.


AND then rode Melias into an old forest, and therein he
rode two days and more.  And then he came into a fair
meadow, and there was a fair lodge of boughs.  And then
he espied in that lodge a chair, wherein was a crown of gold,
subtly wrought.  Also there were cloths covered upon the
earth, and many delicious meats set thereon.  Sir Melias
beheld this adventure, and thought it marvellous, but he
had no hunger, but of the crown of gold he took much
keep; and therewith he stooped down and took it up, and
rode his way with it.  And anon he saw a knight came
riding after him that said:  Knight, set down that crown
which is not yours, and therefore defend you.  Then Sir
Melias blessed him and said:  Fair lord of heaven, help and
save thy new-made knight.  And then they let their horses
run as fast as they might, so that the other knight smote
Sir Melias through hauberk and through the left side, that
he fell to the earth nigh dead.  And then he took the
crown and went his way; and Sir Melias lay still and had
no power to stir.

In the meanwhile by fortune there came Sir Galahad
and found him there in peril of death.  And then he said:
Ah Melias, who hath wounded you? therefore it had been
better to have ridden the other way.  And when Sir
Melias heard him speak:  Sir, he said, for God's love let
me not die in this forest, but bear me unto the abbey here
beside, that I may be confessed and have my rights.  It
shall be done, said Galahad, but where is he that hath
wounded you?  With that Sir Galahad heard in the leaves
cry on high:  Knight, keep thee from me.  Ah sir, said
Melias, beware, for that is he that hath slain me.  Sir
Galahad answered:  Sir knight, come on your peril.  Then
either dressed to other, and came together as fast as their
horses might run, and Galahad smote him so that his spear
went through his shoulder, and smote him down off his
horse, and in the falling Galahad's spear brake.

With that came out another knight out of the leaves,
and brake a spear upon Galahad or ever he might turn
him.  Then Galahad drew out his sword and smote off
the left arm of him, so that it fell to the earth.  And then
he fled, and Sir Galahad pursued fast after him.  And then
he turned again unto Sir Melias, and there he alighted and
dressed him softly on his horse to-fore him, for the truncheon
of his spear was in his body; and Sir Galahad stert up
behind him, and held him in his arms, and so brought him
to the abbey, and there unarmed him and brought him
to his chamber.  And then he asked his Saviour.  And
when he had received Him he said unto Sir Galahad:  Sir,
let death come when it pleaseth him.  And therewith he
drew out the truncheon of the spear out of his body: and
then he swooned.

Then came there an old monk which sometime had
been a knight, and beheld Sir Melias.  And anon he ransacked
him; and then he said unto Sir Galahad:  I shall
heal him of his wound, by the grace of God, within the
term of seven weeks.  Then was Sir Galahad glad, and
unarmed him, and said he would abide there three days.
And then he asked Sir Melias how it stood with him.
Then he said he was turned unto helping, God be
thanked.
