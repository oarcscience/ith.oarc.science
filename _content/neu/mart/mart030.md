    CHAPTER IV

    How Merlin told the adventure of this damosel.

    AT that time there was a knight, the which was the king's son of
    Ireland, and his name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous
    knight, and counted himself one of the best <55>of the court; and
    he had great despite at Balin for the achieving of the sword,
    that any should be accounted more hardy, or more of prowess; and
    he asked King Arthur if he would give him leave to ride after
    Balin and to revenge the despite that he had done.  Do your best,
    said Arthur, I am right wroth with Balin; I would he were quit of
    the despite that he hath done to me and to my court.  Then this
    Lanceor went to his hostelry to make him ready.  In the meanwhile
    came Merlin unto the court of King Arthur, and there was told him
    the adventure of the sword, and the death of the Lady of the
    Lake.  Now shall I say you, said Merlin; this same damosel that
    here standeth, that brought the sword unto your court, I shall
    tell you the cause of her coming: she was the falsest damosel
    that liveth.  Say not so, said they.  She hath a brother, a
    passing good knight of prowess and a full true man; and this
    damosel loved another knight that held her to paramour, and this
    good knight her brother met with the knight that held her to
    paramour, and slew him by force of his hands.  When this false
    damosel understood this, she went to the Lady Lile of Avelion,
    and besought her of help, to be avenged on her own brother.
