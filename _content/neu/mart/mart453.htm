CHAPTER XXIV

How King Arthur marvelled much of the jousting in the field,
and how he rode and found Sir Launcelot.


SO this tournament and this jousts dured long, till it was
near night, for the knights of the Round Table relieved
ever unto King Arthur; for the king was wroth out of
measure that he and his knights might not prevail that
day.  Then Sir Gawaine said to the king:  I marvel where
all this day [be] Sir Bors de Ganis and his fellowship of Sir
Launcelot's blood, I marvel all this day they be not about
you: it is for some cause said Sir Gawaine.  By my head,
said Sir Kay, Sir Bors is yonder all this day upon the right
hand of this field, and there he and his blood do more
worshipfully than we do.  It may well be, said Sir Gawaine,
but I dread me ever of guile; for on pain of my life, said
Sir Gawaine, this knight with the red sleeve of gold is
himself Sir Launcelot, I see well by his riding and by his
great strokes; and the other knight in the same colours
is the good young knight, Sir Lavaine.  Also that knight
with the green shield is my brother, Sir Gareth, and yet
he hath disguised himself, for no man shall never make
him be against Sir Launcelot, because he made him
knight.  By my head, said Arthur, nephew, I believe
you; therefore tell me now what is your best counsel.
Sir, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall have my counsel: let blow
unto lodging, for an he be Sir Launcelot du Lake, and
my brother, Sir Gareth, with him, with the help of that
good young knight, Sir Lavaine, trust me truly it will be
no boot to strive with them but if we should fall ten or
twelve upon one knight, and that were no worship, but
shame.  Ye say truth, said the king; and for to say
sooth, said the king, it were shame to us so many as we
be to set upon them any more; for wit ye well, said King
Arthur, they be three good knights, and namely that
knight with the sleeve of gold.

So then they blew unto lodging; but forthwithal King
Arthur let send unto the four kings, and to the mighty
duke, and prayed them that the knight with the sleeve of
gold depart not from them, but that the king may speak
with him.  Then forthwithal King Arthur alighted and
unarmed him, and took a little hackney and rode after
Sir Launcelot, for ever he had a spy upon him.  And so
he found him among the four kings and the duke; and
there the king prayed them all unto supper, and they
said they would with good will.  And when they were
unarmed then King Arthur knew Sir Launcelot, Sir
Lavaine, and Sir Gareth.  Ah, Sir Launcelot, said King
Arthur, this day ye have heated me and my knights.

So they yede unto Arthur's lodging all together, and
there was a great feast and great revel, and the prize was
given unto Sir Launcelot; and by heralds they named
him that he had smitten down fifty knights, and Sir
Gareth five-and-thirty, and Sir Lavaine four-and-twenty
knights.  Then Sir Launcelot told the king and the
queen how the lady huntress shot him in the forest of
Windsor, in the buttock, with an broad arrow, and how
the wound thereof was that time six inches deep, and in
like long.  Also Arthur blamed Sir Gareth because he
left his fellowship and held with Sir Launcelot.  My lord,
said Sir Gareth, he made me a knight, and when I saw
him so hard bestead, methought it was my worship to
help him, for I saw him do so much, and so many noble
knights against him; and when I understood that he was
Sir Launcelot du Lake, I shamed to see so many knights
against him alone.  Truly, said King Arthur unto Sir
Gareth, ye say well, and worshipfully have ye done and
to yourself great worship; and all the days of my life,
said King Arthur unto Sir Gareth, wit you well I shall
love you, and trust you the more better.  For ever, said
Arthur, it is a worshipful knight's deed to help another
worshipful knight when he seeth him in a great danger;
for ever a worshipful man will be loath to see a worshipful
man shamed; and he that is of no worship, and fareth
with cowardice, never shall he show gentleness, nor no
manner of goodness where he seeth a man in any danger,
for then ever will a coward show no mercy; and always a
good man will do ever to another man as he would be
done to himself.  So then there were great feasts unto
kings and dukes, and revel, game, and play, and all
manner of noblesse was used; and he that was courteous,
true, and faithful, to his friend was that time cherished.
