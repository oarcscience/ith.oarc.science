    CHAPTER XV

    How Balin fought with King Pellam, and how his sword
    brake, and how he gat a spear wherewith he smote the
    dolorous stroke.

    ANON all the knights arose from the table for to set on Balin,
    and King Pellam himself arose up fiercely, and said, Knight, hast
    thou slain my brother? thou shalt die therefore or thou depart. 
    Well, said Balin, do it yourself.  Yes, said King Pellam, there
    shall no man have ado with thee but myself, for the love of my
    brother.  Then King Pellam caught in his hand a grim weapon and
    smote eagerly at Balin; but Balin put the sword betwixt his head
    and the stroke, and therewith his sword burst in sunder.  And
    when Balin was weaponless he ran into a chamber for to seek some
    weapon, and so from chamber to chamber, and no weapon he could
    find, and always King Pellam after him.  And at the last he
    entered into a chamber that was marvellously well dight and
    richly, and a bed arrayed with cloth of gold, the richest that
    might be thought, and one lying therein, and thereby stood a
    table of clean gold with four pillars of silver that bare up the
    table, and upon the table stood a marvellous spear strangely
    wrought.  And when Balin saw that spear, he gat it in his hand
    and turned him to King Pellam, and smote him passingly sore with
    that spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon, and therewith
    the castle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth, and Balin
    fell down so that he might <71>not stir foot nor hand.  And so
    the most part of the castle, that was fallen down through that
    dolorous stroke, lay upon Pellam and Balin three days.
