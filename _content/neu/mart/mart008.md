    CHAPTER IX

    Of the first war that King Arthur had, and
    how he won the field.

    THEN King Arthur came out of his tower, and had under his gown a
    jesseraunt of double mail, and there went with <14>him the
    Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir
    Kay, and Sir Brastias: these were the men of most worship that
    were with him.  And when they were met there was no meekness, but
    stout words on both sides; but always King Arthur answered them,
    and said he would make them to bow an he lived.  Wherefore they
    departed with wrath, and King Arthur bade keep them well, and
    they bade the king keep him well.  So the king returned him to
    the tower again and armed him and all his knights.  What will ye
    do? said Merlin to the kings; ye were better for to stint, for ye
    shall not here prevail though ye were ten times so many.  Be we
    well advised to be afeared of a dream-reader? said King Lot. 
    With that Merlin vanished away, and came to King Arthur, and bade
    him set on them fiercely; and in the meanwhile there were three
    hundred good men, of the best that were with the kings, that went
    straight unto King Arthur, and that comforted him greatly.  Sir,
    said Merlin to Arthur, fight not with the sword that ye had by
    miracle, till that ye see ye go unto the worse, then draw it out
    and do your best.  So forthwithal King Arthur set upon them in
    their lodging.  And Sir Baudwin, Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias slew
    on the right hand and on the left hand that it was marvel; and
    always King Arthur on horseback laid on with a sword, and did
    marvellous deeds of arms, that many of the kings had great joy of
    his deeds and hardiness.

    Then King Lot brake out on the back side, and the King with the
    Hundred Knights, and King Carados, and set on Arthur fiercely
    behind him.  With that Sir Arthur turned with his knights, and
    smote behind and before, and ever Sir Arthur was in the foremost
    press till his horse was slain underneath him.  And therewith
    King Lot smote down King Arthur.  With that his four knights
    received him and set him on horseback.  Then he drew his sword
    Excalibur, but it was so bright in his enemies' eyes, that it
    gave light like thirty torches.  And therewith he put them a-
    back, and slew much people.  And then the commons of Carlion
    arose with clubs and staves <15 CHAP. X  OF KING BAN AND KING
    BORS>and slew many knights; but all the kings held them together
    with their knights that were left alive, and so fled and
    departed.  And Merlin came unto Arthur, and counselled him to
    follow them no further.
