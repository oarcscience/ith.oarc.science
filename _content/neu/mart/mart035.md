    CHAPTER IX

    How Balin and his brother, by the counsel of Merlin, took
    King Rience and brought him to King Arthur.

    THEN Merlin lodged them in a wood among leaves beside the
    highway, and took off the bridles of their horses and put them to
    grass and laid them down to rest them till it was nigh midnight. 
    Then Merlin bade them rise, and make them ready, for the king was
    nigh them, that was stolen away from his host with a three score
    horses of his best knights, and twenty of them rode to-fore to
    warn the Lady de Vance that the king was coming; for that night
    King Rience should have lain with her.  Which is the king? said
    Balin.  Abide, said Merlin, here in a strait way ye shall meet
    with him; and therewith he showed Balin and his brother where he
    rode.

    Anon Balin and his brother met with the king, and smote him down,
    and wounded him fiercely, and laid him to the ground; and there
    they slew on the right hand and the left hand, and slew more than
    forty of his men, and the remnant fled.  Then went they again to
    King Rience and would have slain him had he not yielded him unto
    their grace.  Then said he thus:  Knights full of prowess, slay
    me not, for by my life ye may win, and by my death ye shall win
    nothing.  Then said these two knights, Ye say sooth and truth,
    and so laid him on a horse-litter.  With that Merlin was
    vanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand, and told him how his
    most enemy was taken and discomfited.  By whom? said King Arthur. 
    By two knights, said Merlin, that would please your lordship, and
    to-morrow ye shall know what knights they are.  Anon after came
    the Knight with the Two Swords and Balan his brother, and brought
    with them King Rience of North Wales, and there delivered him to
    the porters, and charged them with him; and so they two returned
    again in the dawning of the day.  King Arthur <62>came then to
    King Rience, and said, Sir king, ye are welcome: by what
    adventure come ye hither?  Sir, said King Rience, I came hither
    by an hard adventure.  Who won you? said King Arthur.  Sir, said
    the king, the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, which
    are two marvellous knights of prowess.  I know them not, said
    Arthur, but much I am beholden to them.  Ah, said Merlin, I shall
    tell you: it is Balin that achieved the sword, and his brother
    Balan, a good knight, there liveth not a better of prowess and of
    worthiness, and it shall be the greatest dole of him that ever I
    knew of knight, for he shall not long endure.  Alas, said King
    Arthur, that is great pity; for I am much beholden unto him, and
    I have ill deserved it unto him for his kindness.  Nay, said
    Merlin, he shall do much more for you, and that shall ye know in
    haste.  But, sir, are ye purveyed, said Merlin, for to-morn the
    host of Nero, King Rience's brother, will set on you or noon with
    a great host, and therefore make you ready, for I will depart
    from you.
