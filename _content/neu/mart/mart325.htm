CHAPTER LXXXVIII

How Sir Palomides kept his day to have foughten, but Sir
Tristram might not come; and other things.


BUT in no wise there was no knight about Sir Tristram
that would believe that ever Sir Palomides would hurt Sir
Tristram, neither by his own hands nor by none other
consenting.  Then when the fifteenth day was come, Sir
Palomides came to the well with four knights with him
of Arthur's court, and three sergeants-of-arms.  And for
this intent Sir Palomides brought the knights with him
and the sergeants-of-arms, for they should bear record of
the battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides.  And
the one sergeant brought in his helm, the other his spear,
the third his sword.  So thus Palomides came into the
field, and there he abode nigh two hours; and then he
sent a squire unto Sir Tristram, and desired him to come
into the field to hold his promise.

When the squire was come to Joyous Gard, anon as
Sir Tristram heard of his coming he let command that the
squire should come to his presence thereas he lay in his
bed.  My lord Sir Tristram, said Palomides' squire, wit
you well my lord, Palomides, abideth you in the field,
and he would wit whether ye would do battle or not.
Ah, my fair brother, said Sir Tristram, wit thou well that
I am right heavy for these tidings; therefore tell Sir
Palomides an I were well at ease I would not lie here, nor
he should have no need to send for me an I might either
ride or go; and for thou shalt say that I am no liar--Sir
Tristram showed him his thigh that the wound was six
inches deep.  And now thou hast seen my hurt, tell thy
lord that this is no feigned matter, and tell him that I had
liefer than all the gold of King Arthur that I were whole;
and tell Palomides as soon as I am whole I shall seek him
endlong and overthwart, and that I promise you as I am true
knight; and if ever I may meet with him, he shall have
battle of me his fill.  And with this the squire departed;
and when Palomides wist that Tristram was hurt he was
glad and said:  Now I am sure I shall have no shame, for
I wot well I should have had hard handling of him, and
by likely I must needs have had the worse, for he is the
hardest knight in battle that now is living except Sir
Launcelot.

And then departed Sir Palomides whereas fortune led
him, and within a month Sir Tristram was whole of his
hurt.  And then he took his horse, and rode from
country to country, and all strange adventures he achieved
wheresomever he rode; and always he enquired for Sir
Palomides, but of all that quarter of summer Sir Tristram
could never meet with Sir Palomides.  But thus as Sir
Tristram sought and enquired after Sir Palomides Sir
Tristram achieved many great battles, wherethrough all
the noise fell to Sir Tristram, and it ceased of Sir
Launcelot; and therefore Sir Launcelot's brethren and his
kinsmen would have slain Sir Tristram because of his
fame.  But when Sir Launcelot wist how his kinsmen
were set, he said to them openly:  Wit you well, that an
the envy of you all be so hardy to wait upon my lord, Sir
Tristram, with any hurt, shame, or villainy, as I am true
knight I shall slay the best of you with mine own hands
Alas, fie for shame, should ye for his noble deeds await
upon him to slay him.  Jesu defend, said Launcelot, that
ever any noble knight as Sir Tristram is should be
destroyed with treason.  Of this noise and fame sprang
into Cornwall, and among them of Liones, whereof they
were passing glad, and made great joy.  And then they
of Liones sent letters unto Sir Tristram of recommendation,
and many great gifts to maintain Sir Tristram's estate;
and ever, between, Sir Tristram resorted unto Joyous Gard
whereas La Beale Isoud was, that loved him as her life.
