CHAPTER LXXXVII

How there was a day set between Sir Tristram and Sir
Palomides for to fight, and how Sir Tristram was hurt.


THEN said Sir Tristram:  I will fight with you to the
uttermost.  I grant, said Palomides, for in a better
quarrel keep I never to fight, for an I die of your hands,
of a better knight's hands may I not be slain.  And sithen
I understand that I shall never rejoice La Beale Isoud, I
have as good will to die as to live.  Then set ye a day,
said Sir Tristram, that we shall do battle.  This day
fifteen days, said Palomides, will I meet with you hereby,
in the meadow under Joyous Gard.  Fie for shame, said
Sir Tristram, will ye set so long day? let us fight
to-morn.  Not so, said Palomides, for I am meagre, and
have been long sick for the love of La Beale Isoud, and
therefore I will repose me till I have my strength again.
So then Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides promised faith
fully to meet at the well that day fifteen days.  I am
remembered, said Sir Tristram to Palomides, that ye
brake me once a promise when that I rescued you from
Breuse Saunce Pit<e'> and nine knights; and then ye
promised me to meet me at the peron and the grave
beside Camelot, whereas at that time ye failed of your
promise.  Wit you well, said Palomides unto Sir Tristram,
I was at that day in prison, so that I might not hold my
promise.  So God me help, said Sir Tristram, an ye
had holden your promise this work had not been here
now at this time.

Right so departed Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides.
And so Sir Palomides took his horse and his harness, and
he rode unto King Arthur's court; and there Sir Palomides
gat him four knights and four sergeants-of-arms,
and so he returned againward unto Joyous Gard.  And
in the meanwhile Sir Tristram chased and hunted at all
manner of venery; and about three days afore the battle
should be, as Sir Tristram chased an hart, there was an
archer shot at the hart, and by misfortune he smote Sir
Tristram in the thick of the thigh, and the arrow slew
Sir Tristram's horse and hurt him.  When Sir Tristram
was so hurt he was passing heavy, and wit ye well he bled
sore; and then he took another horse, and rode unto
Joyous Gard with great heaviness, more for the promise
that he had made with Sir Palomides, as to do battle with
him within three days after, than for any hurt of his thigh.
Wherefore there was neither man nor woman that could
cheer him with anything that they could make to him,
neither Queen La Beale Isoud; for ever he deemed that
Sir Palomides had smitten him so that he should not be
able to do battle with him at the day set.
