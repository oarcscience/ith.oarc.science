    CHAPTER XXII

    How Launcelot after that he was hurt of a gentlewoman
    came to an hermit, and of other matters.


    NOW mercy, fair sir, said the lady, I am a gentlewoman
    that useth here in this forest hunting, and God knoweth I
    saw ye not; but as here was a barren hind at the soil in
    this well, and I weened to have done well, but my hand
    swerved.  Alas, said Sir Launcelot, ye have mischieved
    me.  And so the lady departed, and Sir Launcelot as he
    might pulled out the arrow, and left that head still in his
    buttock, and so he went weakly to the hermitage ever
    more bleeding as he went.  And when Sir Lavaine and
    the hermit espied that Sir Launcelot was hurt, wit you
    well they were passing heavy, but Sir Lavaine wist not
    how that he was hurt nor by whom.  And then were they
    wroth out of measure.

    Then with great pain the hermit gat out the arrow's
    head out of Sir Launcelot's buttock, and much of his blood
    he shed, and the wound was passing sore, and unhappily
    smitten, for it was in such a place that he might not sit in
    no saddle.  Have mercy, Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, I may
    call myself the most unhappiest man that liveth, for ever
    when I would fainest have worship there befalleth me
    ever some unhappy thing.  Now so Jesu me help, said Sir
    Launcelot, and if no man would but God, I shall be in the
    field upon Candlemas Day at the jousts, whatsomever fall
    of it: so all that might be gotten to heal Sir Launcelot
    was had.

    So when the day was come Sir Launcelot let devise
    that he was arrayed, and Sir Lavaine, and their horses, as
    though they had been Saracens; and so they departed and
    came nigh to the field.  The King of Northgalis with an
    hundred knights with him, and the King of Northumberland
    brought with him an hundred good knights, and
    King Anguish of Ireland brought with him an hundred
    good knights ready to joust, and Sir Galahad, the haut
    prince, brought with him an hundred good knights, and
    the King with the Hundred Knights brought with him
    as many, and all these were proved good knights.  Then
    came in King Arthur's party; and there came in the
    King of Scots with an hundred knights, and King Uriens
    of Gore brought with him an hundred knights, and King
    Howel of Brittany brought with him an hundred knights,
    and Chaleins of Clarance brought with him an hundred
    knights, and King Arthur himself came into the field
    with two hundred knights, and the most part were
    knights of the Table Round, that were proved noble
    knights; and there were old knights set in scaffolds for
    to judge, with the queen, who did best.
