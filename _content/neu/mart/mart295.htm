CHAPTER LVIII

How they approached the Castle Lonazep, and of other
devices of the death of Sir Lamorak.


THUS they rode until they were ware of the Castle
Lonazep.  And then were they ware of four hundred
tents and pavilions, and marvellous great ordinance.  So
God me help, said Sir Tristram, yonder I see the greatest
ordinance that ever I saw.  Sir, said Palomides, meseemeth
that there was as great an ordinance at the Castle of
Maidens upon the rock, where ye won the prize, for I
saw myself where ye forjousted thirty knights.  Sir, said
Dinadan, and in Surluse, at that tournament that Galahalt
of the Long Isles made, the which there dured seven days,
was as great a gathering as is here, for there were many
nations.  Who was the best? said Sir Tristram.  Sir, it
was Sir Launcelot du Lake and the noble knight, Sir
Lamorak de Galis, and Sir Launcelot won the degree.  I
doubt not, said Sir Tristram, but he won the degree, so
he had not been overmatched with many knights; and of
the death of Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, it was over
great pity, for I dare say he was the cleanest mighted man
and the best winded of his age that was alive; for I knew
him that he was the biggest knight that ever I met withal,
but if it were Sir Launcelot.  Alas, said Sir Tristram, full
woe is me for his death.  And if they were not the cousins
of my lord Arthur that slew him, they should die for it,
and all those that were consenting to his death.  And for
such things, said Sir Tristram, I fear to draw unto the
court of my lord Arthur; I will that ye wit it, said Sir
Tristram unto Gareth.

Sir, I blame you not, said Gareth, for well I understand
the vengeance of my brethren Sir Gawaine, Agravaine,
Gaheris, and Mordred.  But as for me, said Sir
Gareth, I meddle not of their matters, therefore there is
none of them that loveth me.  And for I understand they
be murderers of good knights I left their company; and
God would I had been by, said Gareth, when the noble
knight, Sir Lamorak, was slain.  Now as Jesu be my help,
said Sir Tristram, it is well said of you, for I had liefer
than all the gold betwixt this and Rome I had been there.
Y-wis,[1] said Palomides, and so would I had been there,
and yet had I never the degree at no jousts nor tournament
thereas he was, but he put me to the worse, or on
foot or on horseback; and that day that he was slain he
did the most deeds of arms that ever I saw knight do in
all my life days.  And when him was given the degree by
my lord Arthur, Sir Gawaine and his three brethren, Agravaine,
Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, set upon Sir Lamorak in
a privy place, and there they slew his horse.  And so they
fought with him on foot more than three hours, both
before him and behind him; and Sir Mordred gave him
his death wound behind him at his back, and all to-hew
him: for one of his squires told me that saw it.  Fie
upon treason, said Sir Tristram, for it killeth my heart to
hear this tale.  So it doth mine, said Gareth; brethren as
they be mine I shall never love them, nor draw in their
fellowship for that deed.

Now speak we of other deeds, said Palomides, and let
him be, for his life ye may not get again.  That is the
more pity, said Dinadan, for Sir Gawaine and his brethren,
except you Sir Gareth, hate all the good knights of the
Round Table for the most part; for well I wot an they
might privily, they hate my lord Sir Launcelot and all his
kin, and great privy despite they have at him; and that
is my lord Sir Launcelot well ware of, and that causeth
him to have the good knights of his kin about him.
