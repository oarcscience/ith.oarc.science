## THE BEWITCHED HORSE.

A <span class="small">FARMER’S</span> old horse had died, so he skinned
it, and threw it behind the threshing-floor, intending to bury it next
day. He saw a great toad creep under it as he went away. At night he
went into the barn to sleep, and hearing a noise outside, kept watch for
thieves; but, to his horror, he saw the door slowly open, and his dead
horse enter. The horse came in snuffling and snorting, and broke down
several of the posts that supported the loft where his master had been
sleeping; but the farmer contrived to scramble into the rafters. At last
the cock crew, when the horse fell down like a lump of meat, and the
farmer too lost his hold and fell upon him. Next morning the farmer
buried the horse, and stamped three times with his left heel on the
grave; so the horse remained quiet.

 But it was a sorcerer who had a grudge against the farmer who had sent
the toad into the carcass of the horse.
