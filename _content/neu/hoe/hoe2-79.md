## THE ORIGIN OF THE SWALLOW.

T<span class="small">HE</span> wife of a drunkard was sitting weaving
with her child on her lap. She wore a black cloth on her head, a red
neckerchief, a white shift, and a coal-black petticoat. When her husband
came home, he pushed his wife away, and destroyed the loom <span
id="page_284">p. 284</span> with an axe. Then he killed the child with a
blow of his fist, and beat his wife till she fell senseless. But Ukko
took pity on her, and changed her into a swallow. As she was trying to
escape, the man struck at her with a knife, but only cleft her tail.
Since that time she flies about twittering her misfortunes, and does not
shun men like other birds, but builds her nest against their houses.
