 Kreutzwald relates several other stories of young adventurers who go
forth into the world to seek their fortunes with the aid of powerful
protectors.

 In one of these, “The Magician in the Pocket,” a young man releases a
magician who had been imprisoned by his enemy under a great stone, after
which the magician accompanies him in his wanderings in the form of a
flea, and helps him to deliver four princesses from enchantment, one of
whom he marries. In another, “The God-Daughter of the Rock-Maidens,” a
young girl named Maasika (Strawberry) is taken down into an underground
region by her godmothers, the rock-spirits, one of whom her mother had
once aided when in distress. When she is grown up, she goes out into the
world, kills the king of the serpents, and disenchants a king, queen,
and prince, who prove to be the parents and brother of her godmothers,
and she marries the prince. In a third story, “The Foundling,” the hero
likewise goes out in a similar manner, and meets with various adventures
before marrying a princess.
