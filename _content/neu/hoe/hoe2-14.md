## THE WOMAN IN THE MOON. (J<span class="small">ANNSEN.</span>)

O<span class="small">NE</span> Saturday evening a woman went very late
to the river to fetch water. The Moon shone brightly in the heavens, and
she said to him, “Why do you stand gaping up there? You’d better come
and help me carry water. I must work here, and you dawdle about above!”

 Suddenly the Moon came down from above, but he seized the woman and
took her with him into the sky. There she still stands with her two
pails as a warning to everybody not to work too late in the evening on
holidays. But the Moon knows no rest, and can never dawdle about, for he
must wander from land to land, and everywhere illumine the darkness of
night with his light.<span id="page_37_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_37_note_1)
