## THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY CROSS.

A <span class="small">BLIND</span> nobleman of Vastemois, near Fellin,
was driving out one day, when his coachman saw a splendid golden cross.
His master ordered him to drive up to it; and on touching it, he
recovered his sight. In gratitude, he built a church on the spot, which
was afterwards destroyed in war-time, and only the walls left standing.
The people were too poor to rebuild it, but from the ruins grew a tree
which all regarded as holy. The then over-lord commanded them to fell
it, and as they refused, he did so himself, but was immediately struck
blind.
