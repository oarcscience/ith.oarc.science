## THE SPIDER AND THE HORNET.

O<span class="small">NCE</span> upon a time some boys burned a hornet’s
nest because the hornet stung them so badly. Then the hornet went to God
to complain that the boys despised His gifts, and scattered broken
victuals about in the fields. But God objected that she had no
witnesses. So she went to the king of the spiders, and made him return
with her to God, who asked if he had seen the boys scatter food about
the fields. But the spider said that it was not their fault, for they
had no table to put their bread on. Then God praised the spider for
speaking the truth, and condemned the hornet for telling lies and hating
her neighbours without a <span id="page_285">p. 285</span> cause. He
then struck her on the back with his staff, and cast her down from
heaven to earth, so that she broke in two with the fall. But he let the
spider down with a cord, because he had spoken the truth. Since then the
spider has had a net and a web, by which he can climb up and down as he
likes, as on a cord; but the hornet still retains the pinched-in body
which she got when falling from heaven, but is fat enough at both ends.
