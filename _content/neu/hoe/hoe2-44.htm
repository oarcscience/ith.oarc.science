<H2 ALIGN="center">THE MAGIC EGG.<BR> (J<SMALL>ANNSEN.</SMALL>)</H2>

<P>I<SMALL>N</SMALL> former days, people used to find bits of leather, and fragments of old gloves, shoes, and hats on the moor; but if anybody took them home, some misfortune befell him. One day a man found what he thought was a duck&#8217;s egg, and boiled and ate it; but the more he ate, the more there seemed to be, and he could not finish it. Next morning the portion left proved to be not an egg, but half his neighbour&#8217;s cat.</P>
