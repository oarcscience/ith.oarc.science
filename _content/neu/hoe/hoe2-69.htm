<H2 ALIGN="center">THE CHURCH AT REVEL.</H2>

<P>R<SMALL>EVEL</SMALL> was formerly an unimportant place, and the inhabitants wished to make it famous by building a church. They contracted with the great architect Olaf<A NAME="page_262_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_262_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> to erect it; and when it was completed, and he was about to fix the cross on the summit, his wife cried out joyfully, &#8220;Olaf will come home to-day with a thousand barrels of gold.&#8221;<A NAME="page_262_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_262_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> But scarcely had

Olaf fixed the cross in its place, when he slipped and fell to the ground, and a toad and a snake sprang out of his mouth. The Devil wished to destroy the church, but could not get near it; so he made a sling at Pernau, and hurled a great rock at it. But the sling broke, and the rock fell half-way between Pernau and Revel, where it now remains.

<P><A NAME="page_262_note_2"></A><A HREF="#page_262_fr_2">2</A> This incident reminds us of the story of St. Olaf and the giant Wind and Weather (see Keightley&#8217;s <I>Fairy Mythology</I>, Bohn&#8217;s edition, 1860, p. 117), though here it is the giant church-builder who falls. According to one of the legends of Cologne Cathedral, the architect was hurled from the top of the unfinished building by the Devil. The calling of a person by name was often regarded by the Scandinavians as a death-omen.</P>
