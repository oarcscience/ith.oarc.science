## THE CHURCH AT FELLIN.

I<span class="small">N</span> former days, the church of Fellin did not
stand where it stands at present, but close to the lake. It was
prophesied that it should stand till seven brothers should be present in
it together. When this happened by chance, the church began to sink. The
congregation escaped, except the seven brothers, <span id="page_266">p.
266</span> who remained in it, but it sunk till even the summit of the
spire had disappeared. The site is now a marshy meadow, but if any one
is there near midnight on New Year’s Eve, he hears entrancing voices,
and cannot move from the spot till the church clock beneath the ground
has struck the last stroke of twelve.
