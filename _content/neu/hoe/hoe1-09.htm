<H2 ALIGN="center">CANTO IV<BR> <SMALL>THE ISLAND MAIDEN</SMALL></H2>

<P>W<SMALL>HEN</SMALL> the Kalevide had satisfied himself that no further traces of his mother were to be found, he cast himself into the sea beneath the stars, and swam northwards manfully towards Finland, swimming with his hands, steering with his feet, and with his hair floating like a sail. He swam on till past midnight without meeting with a resting-place; but at length he espied a black speck in the distance, which proved to be a small rocky island. The hero discovered a mossy bank on a projecting rock, and made his way to the shore, and lay down, intending to sleep a little, when he was roused by the voice of a maiden singing a love-song. It was very dark and somewhat foggy, but he saw the light of a fire at a little distance at the foot of an oak-tree, beneath which sat a fair girl with brown eyes.<A NAME="page_32_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_32_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> The hero soon joined

her, and they talked together for some time, when the maiden became alarmed at his familiarities, and cried out. Her mother awoke, and thought it was only a bad dream; but her father hastened to her aid, armed with a great club. But when he saw the terrible giant, he grew as pale as death, and his club dropped from his hand.</P>

<P>&#8195;The maiden could not lift her eyes to her father, but the Kalevide asked carelessly if he had seen the Finnish sorcerer pass the island in his boat on the previous evening. &#8220;No,&#8221; replied the islander, &#8220;I have not seen anything of him for weeks; but tell me your name and lineage, for I judge that you are of the race of the gods.&#8221; The hero answered him fully; but when the maiden heard that he was the son of Kalev and Linda, she was seized with terror, and her foot slipping she fell from the cliff into the sea.</P>

<P>&#8195;The father shrieked and wrung his hands, but the Kalevide plunged into the sea after the maiden, and sought for her for a long time in vain. When he abandoned the search, he did not venture to return to the island, but after crying out a few words of unavailing regret swam again towards Finland. The father&#8217;s cry of despair fully roused the mother, who sprang up, and ran down to the shore, only to learn that her daughter was lost.</P>

<P>&#8195;Then the mother took a rake with a long copper handle, and the father took his net, and with them they sought for their daughter&#8217;s body at the bottom of the sea.<A NAME="page_34_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_34_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> They did not find their daughter, but they raked up an oak-tree, a fir-tree, an eagle&#8217;s egg, an iron helmet, a fish, and a silver dish. They took them all carefully home, and went again to seek for their lost child.</P>

<P>&#8195;Then a song arose from the deep, telling how a maiden went down to the sea:<A NAME="page_34_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_34_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A></P>

<TR><TD><SMALL>&#8195;And the maiden heard and hearkened,<BR> And the little duck made answer:<BR>

<P>&#8195;Then the man of copper offered her the weapons if she would take him as her husband, but she refused, saying that she was the daughter of a landsman, and preferred a husband from the village on the land. He laughed scornfully; her foot slipped, and she sank into the sea. Her father and mother came to seek her, and found only her ornaments scattered on the beach. They called her by her name, and implored her to go home with them; but she answered that she could not,

for she was weighed down by the water; and she related to them her adventure with the copper man. But she begged her parents not to weep for her, for she had a house at the bottom of the sea, and a soft resting-place in the ooze.</P>

evidently corresponds to the lost sister of Kullervo (<I>Kalevala</I>, Runo 35), whom he meets casually, and seduces. When they discover the truth, the girl throws herself into a torrent. In the <I>Kalevipoeg</I>, Canto 7, the Kalevide and the maiden are actually spoken of as brother and sister. There are many versions of this story; in one of them (Neus, <I>Ehstnische Volkslieder</I>, pp. 5-8; Latham&#8217;s <I>Nationalities of Europe</I>, i. p. 138), the maiden is represented as slaying her brother, who is called indifferently the son of Kalev or of Sullev, to the great satisfaction of her father and mother.</P>
