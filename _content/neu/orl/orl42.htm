<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
The victory with Count Orlando lies;<BR>
But good Rinaldo and Bradamant at heart,<BR>
(One for Angelica, the other sighs<BR>
For young Rogero) suffer cruel smart.<BR>
Him that in chase of the Indian damsel hies<BR>
Disdain preserves; from thence does he depart<BR>
Towards Italy, and is with courteous cheer<BR>
And welcome guested by a cavalier.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
What bit, what iron curb is to be found,<BR>
Or (could it be) what adamantine rein,<BR>
That can make wrath keep order and due bound,<BR>
And within lawful limits him contain?<BR>
When one, to whom the constant heart is bound<BR>
And linked by Love with solid bolt and chain,<BR>
We see, through violence or through foul deceit,<BR>
With mortal damage or dishonour meet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
And is the mind sometimes, if so possest,<BR>
To ill and savage action led astray,<BR>
It may deserve excuse; in that the breast<BR>
No more is under Reason&#8217;s sovereign sway.<BR>
Achilles, when, beneath his borrowed crest,<BR>
He saw Patroclus crimsoning the way,<BR>
Was with his murderer&#8217;s slaughter ill content,<BR>
Till he his mangled corse had dragged and shent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Unconquered Duke Alphonso, anger so<BR>
Inflamed thy host the day that weighty stone<BR>
Wounded thy forehead with such grievous blow,<BR>
That all believed it to its rest was gone;<BR>
&#8212;Inflamed them with such fury, for the foe<BR>
In rampart, fosse, or wall, defence was none,<BR>
Who, one and all, within their works lay dead,<BR>
Nor wight was left the woeful news to spread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Seeing thy fall caused thine such mighty pain,<BR>
They were to fury moved; hadst thou, my lord,<BR>
Maintained thy footing, haply might thy train<BR>
Have with less licence plied the murderous sword.<BR>
Enough for thee thy Bastia to regain!<BR>
In fewer hours replaced beneath thy ward,<BR>
Then Cordova&#8217;s and fierce Granada&#8217;s band<BR>
Took days erewhile, to wrest it from thy hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Haply Heaven&#8217;s vengeance ordered what befel,<BR>
And in that case thy wound so hindered thee<BR>
To the end, the cruel outrage, foul and fell,<BR>
Done by that band before, should punished be.<BR>
For after the unhappy Vestidel,<BR>
Wearied and hurt, had sought their clemency,<BR>
Among them (mostly an unchristened train)<BR>
He, mid a hundred swords, unarmed, was slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
To end; I say that other rage is none<BR>
Which can be weighed with that in equal wise,<BR>
Which kindles, when an injury is done<BR>
To kinsman, friend or lord before our eyes.<BR>
Then justly in Orlando&#8217;s heart, for one<BR>
So dear to him, might sudden fury rise;<BR>
When him he saw, extended on the sand,<BR>
Slain by the stroke of fierce Gradasso&#8217;s brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
As nomade swain, who darting on its way<BR>
In slippery line the horrid snake has seen,<BR>
That his young son, amid the sands at play,<BR>
Has killed with venomed tooth, enflamed with spleen,<BR>
Grasps his batoon, the poisonous worm to slay;<BR>
His sword, than every other sword more keen,<BR>
So, in his fury grasped Anglantes&#8217; knight,<BR>
And wreaked on Agramant his first despite,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Scaped, bleeding, with helm loosened form his head,<BR>
With half a shield and swordless, through his mail,<BR>
Sore wounded in more places than is said;<BR>
As from the dull or envious falcon&#8217;s nail,<BR>
Escapes the unhappy sparrowhawk, half dead,<BR>
With ruffled plumage and with loss of tail.<BR>
On him Orlando came and smote him just<BR>
Where with the helmed head confined the bust.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Loosed was the helm, the neck without its band:<BR>
So, like a rush, was severed by the sword.<BR>
Down-fell, and shook its last upon the sand<BR>
The heavy trunk of Libya&#8217;s mighty lord.<BR>
His spirit, which flitted to the Stygian strand,<BR>
Charon with crooked boat-hook dragged aboard.<BR>
On him Orlando wastes no further pain,<BR>
But, sword in hand, seeks him of Sericane.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
As the headless trunk of Africk&#8217;s cavalier<BR>
Extended on the shore Gradasso&#8217;s viewed,<BR>
(What never had befallen him whilere)<BR>
He shook at heart, a troubled visage shewed,<BR>
And, at the coming of Anglantes&#8217; peer,<BR>
Presageful of his fate, appears subdued:<BR>
Nor seeks he means of fence against his foe,<BR>
When fierce Orlando deals the fatal blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Orlando levels at his better side,<BR>
Beneath the lowest rib, his faulchion bright;<BR>
And crimsoned to the hilt, a hand&#8217;s breadth wide<BR>
Of the other flank, the sword appears in sight;<BR>
And well his mighty puissance testified,<BR>
And spoke him as the strongest living knight<BR>
That stroke, by which a warrior was undone,<BR>
Better than whom in Paynimry was none.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Little his victory good Orlando cheers:<BR>
Himself he quickly from his saddle throws;<BR>
And, with a face disturbed, and wet with tears,<BR>
To his Brandimart in haste the warrior goes;<BR>
The field about him red with blood appears,<BR>
His helmet cleft as by a hatchet&#8217;s blows;<BR>
And, had it been than spungy rind more frail,<BR>
Would have defended him no worse than mail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Orlando lifts the helmet, and descries<BR>
Brandimart&#8217;s head by that destructive brand<BR>
Cleft even to his nose, between the eyes;<BR>
Yet so the wounded knight his spirits manned,<BR>
That pardon of the king of Paradise<BR>
He, before death, was able to demand,<BR>
And to exhort to patience Brava&#8217;s peer,<BR>
Whose manly cheeks were wet with many a tear;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
And&#8212;&#8220;Roland, in thy helping orisons, I<BR>
Beseech thee to remember me,&#8221; he cried,<BR>
&#8220;Nor recommend to thee less warmly my&#8212;&#8220;<BR>
&#8212;Flordelice would, but could not, say&#8212;and died;<BR>
And sounds and songs of angels in the sky,<BR>
As the soul parts, are heard on every side;<BR>
Which from its prison freed, mid hymns of love,<BR>
Ascends into the blissful realms above.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Orlando, albeit he should joy in heart<BR>
At death so holy, and is certified<BR>
That called to bliss above is Brandimart;<BR>
For he heaven opened to the knight described;<BR>
Through human wilfulness&#8212;which aye takes part<BR>
With our weak senses&#8212;hardly can abide<BR>
The loss of one, above a brother dear,<BR>
Nor can refrain from many a scalding tear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Warlike Sobrino, of much blood bereaved,<BR>
Which from his flank and wounded visage rained,<BR>
Long since had fallen, reversed and sore aggrieved,<BR>
And had by now his vessels well nigh drained.<BR>
Olivier too lies stretched; nor has retrieved,<BR>
Nor can retrieve, his crippled foot, save sprained,<BR>
And almost crushed; so long between the plain,<BR>
And his stout courser jammed, the limb has lain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
And but Orlando helped (so woe begone<BR>
Was weeping Olivier, and brought so low)<BR>
He could not have released his limb alone;<BR>
And, when released, endures such pain, such woe,<BR>
The helpless warrior cannot stand upon,<BR>
Or shift withal his wounded foot, and so<BR>
Benumbed and crippled is the leg above,<BR>
That he without assistance cannot move.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The victory brought Orlando small delight;<BR>
On whom too heavily and hardly weighed<BR>
Of slaughtered Brandimart the piteous sight;<BR>
Nor sure of Oliviero&#8217;s life he made.<BR>
Sobrino yet survived; but little light<BR>
The wounded monarch had, amid much shade:<BR>
For almost spend his ebbing life remained<BR>
So fast from him the crimson blood had drained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
The County has him taken, bleeding sore;<BR>
Thither, where he is saved with sovereign care;<BR>
And he as if a kinsman of the Moor,<BR>
Benignly comforts him and speaks him fair:<BR>
For in Orlando, when the strife was o&#8217;er,<BR>
Was nothing evil; ever prompt to spare.<BR>
He from the dead their arms and coursers reft,<BR>
The rest he to their knives&#8217; disposal left.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Here as my story stood not on good ground,<BR>
Frederick Fulgoso doubtful does appear;<BR>
Who, searching Barbary&#8217;s every shore and sound<BR>
Erewhile on board a squadron, landed here;<BR>
And the isle so rugged and so rocky found,<BR>
In all its parts so mountainous and drear,<BR>
There is not (through the land) a level space<BR>
(He says) whereon a single boot to place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Nor deems he likely, that six cavaliers,<BR>
The wide world&#8217;s flower, on Alpine rock should vye,<BR>
In that equestrian fight, with levelled spears.<BR>
To whose objection thus I make reply:<BR>
Erewhile a place, well fit for such careers,<BR>
Stretched at the bottom of the hills did lie;<BR>
But afterwards, o&#8217;erthrown by earthquake&#8217;s shock,<BR>
A cliff o&#8217;erspread the plain with broken rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
So, of Fulgoso&#8217;s race thou shining ray,<BR>
Clear, lasting light, if, questioning my word,<BR>
Thou on this point hast ever said me nay,<BR>
And haply too, before the unconquered lord,<BR>
Through whom thy land, reposing, casts away<BR>
All haste, and wholly leans to kind accord,<BR>
Prythee delay not to declare, that I<BR>
In this my story haply tell no lie.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile his eyes the good Orlando reared,<BR>
And saw, on turning them to seaward, where<BR>
Under full sail a nimble bark appeared,<BR>
As if she to that island would repair.<BR>
I will not now rehearse who thither steered;<BR>
For more than one awaiteth me elsewhere.<BR>
Wend me to France and see if they be glad<BR>
At having chased the Saracens, or sad;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
See what she does withal, the lady true,<BR>
That sees her knight content to wend so wide;<BR>
Of the afflicted Bradamant I shew;<BR>
After she saw the oath was nullified,<BR>
Made in the hearing of those armies two,<BR>
Upon the Christian and the paynim side;<BR>
Since he again had failed her, there was nought<BR>
Wherein she could confide, the damsel thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
And now her too accustomed plaint and wail<BR>
Repeating, of Rogero&#8217;s cruelty<BR>
Fair Bradamant renewed the wonted tale;<BR>
She cursed her hard and evil destiny;<BR>
Then loosening to tempestuous grief the sail,<BR>
Heaven that consented to such perjury,<BR>
&#8212;And did not yet by some plain token speak&#8212;<BR>
She, in her passion, called unjust and weak.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
The sage Melissa she accused, and cursed<BR>
The oracle of the cavern, through whose lie<BR>
She in that sea of love herself immersed,<BR>
Upon whose waters she embarked to die.<BR>
She to Marphisa afterwards rehearsed<BR>
Her woes, and told her brother&#8217;s perfidy;<BR>
She chides, pours forth her sorrows, and demands,<BR>
With tears and outcries, succour at her hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa shrugs her shoulders; what alone<BR>
She can, she offers&#8212;comfort to the fair;<BR>
Nor thinks Rogero her has so foregone<BR>
But what to her he shortly will repair.<BR>
And, should he not, such outrage to be done,<BR>
The damsel plights her promise not to bear;<BR>
Twixt her and him shall deadly war be waged,<BR>
Or he shall keep the word, which he engaged.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
She makes her somewhat thus her grief restrain;<BR>
Which having vent in some sort spend its gall,<BR>
Now we have seen the damsel in her pain<BR>
Rogero impious, proud, and perjured call,<BR>
See we, if in a happier state remain<BR>
The brother of that gentle maid withal;<BR>
Whose flesh, bones, nerves, and sinews are a prey<BR>
To burning love; Rinaldo I would say.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
I say Rinaldo that (as known to you)<BR>
Angelica the beauteous loved so well:<BR>
Nor him into the amorous fillets drew<BR>
So much her beauty as the magic spell.<BR>
In peace reposed those other barons true;<BR>
For wholly broken was the infidel:<BR>
Alone amid the victors, he, of all<BR>
The paladins, remained Love&#8217;s captive thrall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
To seek her he a hundred couriers sent,<BR>
And sought as well, himself, the missing maid:<BR>
He in the end to Malagigi went,<BR>
Who in his need had often given him aid:<BR>
To him he told his love, with eyelids bent<BR>
On earth, and visage crimsoned o&#8217;er; and prayed<BR>
That sage magicians to instruct him, where<BR>
He in the world might find the long-sought fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
A case, so strange and wondrous, marvel sore<BR>
In friendly Malagigi&#8217;s bosom bred:<BR>
The wizard knew, a hundred times and more,<BR>
He might have had the damsel in his bed;<BR>
And he himself, to move the knight or yore,<BR>
In her behalf, enough had done and said:<BR>
Had him by prayer and menace sought to bend,<BR>
Yet ne&#8217;er was able to obtain his end;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
And so much more, that out of prison ward<BR>
He then would Malagigi so have brought.<BR>
Now will he seek her, of his own accord,<BR>
On less occasion, when it profits nought.<BR>
Next that magician Montalbano&#8217;s lord<BR>
To mark how sorely do had erred, besought:<BR>
Since little lacked, but through the boon denied,<BR>
Erewhile he had in gloomy dungeon died.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
But how much more Rinaldo&#8217;s strange demand<BR>
Sounded importunately in his ear,<BR>
So by sure index Malagigi scanned,<BR>
That so much was Angelica more dear.<BR>
Rinaldo prayer unable to withstand,<BR>
In ocean sunk the wizard cavalier<BR>
All memory of old injury assaid,<BR>
And bowned himself to give the warrior aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
For his reply he craved some small delay,<BR>
And with fair hope consoled Mount Alban&#8217;s knight,<BR>
He should be able of the road to say<BR>
By which Angelica had sped her flight,<BR>
In France or wheresoe&#8217;er; then wends his way<BR>
Thither where he is wont his imps to cite;<BR>
A grot impervious and with mountains walled:<BR>
His book he opened and the spirits called.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Then one he chooses, in love-cases read,<BR>
Whom Malagigi to declare requires,<BR>
How good Rinaldo&#8217;s heart, before so died,<BR>
Was now so quickly moved by soft desires;<BR>
And of those fountains twain (the demon said)<BR>
Whereof one lights, one quenches amorous fires;<BR>
And how nought cures the mischief caused by one<BR>
But that whose streams in counter current run;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
And says, Rinaldo, having drunk whilere<BR>
From the love-chasing fountain&#8217;s mossy urn,<BR>
To Angelica, that long had wooed the peer,<BR>
Had shown himself so obstinate and stern;<BR>
And he, whom after his ill star did steer<BR>
To drink of that which makes the bosom burn,<BR>
Her whom but just before he loathed above<BR>
All reason, by that draught was forced to love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Him his ill star and cruel fate conveyed<BR>
To swallow fire and flame i&#8217; the frozen lake:<BR>
For nigh at the same time the Indian maid<BR>
In the other bitter stream her thirst did slake;<BR>
Which in her bosom so all love allayed,<BR>
Henceforth she loathed him more than noisome snake;<BR>
He loved her, and such love was his, as late<BR>
Rinaldo bore her enmity and hate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Of this strange story fully certified<BR>
Was Malagigi by the demon&#8217;s lore;<BR>
Who news as well of Angelique supplied;<BR>
How yielding up herself to a young Moor,<BR>
With him embarking on the unstable tide,<BR>
She had abandoned Europe&#8217;s every shore;<BR>
And hoisting her bold canvas to the wind,<BR>
In Catalonian galley loosed for Ind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo seeking out the sage anew<BR>
For his reply&#8212;he would dissuade the knight<BR>
From loving more that Indian lady, who<BR>
Now waited on a vile barbarian wight;<BR>
And was so distant he could ill pursue;<BR>
If he would chase the damsel on her flight,<BR>
Who must have measured than half her way<BR>
Homeward, with young Medoro to Cat&agrave;y.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
In that bold lover no displeasure deep<BR>
The journey of Angelica would move;<BR>
Nor yet would mar or break the warrior&#8217;s sleep<BR>
To think that he again must eastward rove:<BR>
But that a stripling Saracen should reap<BR>
The first fruits of that faithless lady&#8217;s love<BR>
In him such passion bred, such heart-ache sore,<BR>
He never in his life so grieved before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
No power hath he to make one sole reply;<BR>
His heart, his lip, is quivering with disdain;<BR>
His tongue no word is able to untie;<BR>
His mouth is bitter, and &#8217;twould seem with bane.<BR>
He flung from the magician suddenly,<BR>
And, as by fury stirred and jealous pain,<BR>
He after mighty plaint and mighty woe<BR>
Resolved anew to eastern realms to go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
Licence he asks of Pepin&#8217;s royal son,<BR>
Upon the ground, since with his courser dear<BR>
To Sericane is King Gradasso gone,<BR>
Against the use of gallant cavalier,<BR>
Him honour moves the selfsame course to run,<BR>
In the end he may prevent the paynim peer<BR>
From ever vaunting, that with sword or lance<BR>
He took him from a Paladin of France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
Charles gives him leave to go; though, far and nigh,<BR>
With him all France laments he thence should wend;<BR>
But he in fine that prayer can ill deny,<BR>
So honest seems the worthy warrior&#8217;s end.<BR>
Him Dudon, Guido, would accompany;<BR>
But he refuses either valiant friend:<BR>
From Paris he departs, and wends alone,<BR>
Plunged in his grief and heaving many a groan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Ever in memory dwells the restless thought,<BR>
He might a thousand times have had the fair;<BR>
And&#8212;mad and obstinate&#8212;had, when besought,<BR>
A thousand times refused such beauty rare;<BR>
And such sweet joy was whilom set at nought,<BR>
Such bright, such blessed moments wasted were;<BR>
And now he life would gladly give away<BR>
To have that damsel but for one short day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
The thought will never from his mind depart,<BR>
How for a sorry footpage she could slight,<BR>
&#8212;Flinging their merit and their love apart&#8212;<BR>
The service of each former loving wight.<BR>
Vext by such thought, which racked and rent his heart,<BR>
Rinaldo wends towards the rising light:<BR>
He the straight road to Rhine and Basle pursued,<BR>
Till he arrived in Arden&#8217;s mighty wood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
When within that adventurous wood has hied<BR>
For many a mile Montalban&#8217;s cavalier,<BR>
Of lonely farm or lordly castle wide,<BR>
Where the rude place was roughest and most drear,<BR>
The sky disturbed he suddenly descried,<BR>
He saw the sun&#8217;s dimmed visage disappear,<BR>
And spied forth issuing from a cavern hoar<BR>
A monster, which a woman&#8217;s likeness wore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
A thousand lidless eyes are in her head:<BR>
She cannot close them, nor, I think, doth sleep:<BR>
She listens with as many ears, and spread<BR>
Like hair, about her forehead serpents creep.<BR>
Forth issued into day that figure dread<BR>
From devilish darkness and the caverned deep.<BR>
For tail, a fierce and bigger serpent wound<BR>
About her breast, and girt the monster round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
What in a thousand, thousand quests had ne&#8217;er<BR>
Befal&#8217;n Rinaldo, here befel the knight;<BR>
Who, when he sees the horrid form appear,<BR>
Coming to seek him and prepared for fight,<BR>
Feels in his inmost veins such freezing fear,<BR>
As haply never fell on other wight;<BR>
Yet wonted daring counterfeits and feigns,<BR>
And with a trembling hand the faulchion strains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
The monster so the fierce assault did make<BR>
Therein her master was well descried,<BR>
It might be said; she shook a poisonous snake,<BR>
And now on this, now on the other side,<BR>
Leapt at the knight; at her Rinaldo strake<BR>
Ever meanwhile with random blows and wide;<BR>
With forestroke, backstroke, he assails the foe;<BR>
He often smites, but never plants a blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
The monster threw a serpent at his breast,<BR>
That froze his heart beneath its iron case:<BR>
Now through the vizor flung the poisonous pest,<BR>
Which crept about his collar and his face.<BR>
Dismaid, Rinaldo fled the field, and prest<BR>
With all his spurs his courser through the chase:<BR>
But not behind the hellish monster halts,<BR>
Who in a thought upon the crupper vaults.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Wend where the warrior will, an-end or wide,<BR>
Ever with him is that accursed Pest:<BR>
Nor knows he how from her to be untied,<BR>
Albeit his courser plunges without rest.<BR>
Like a leaf quakes his heart within his side,<BR>
Not that the snakes in other mode molest,<BR>
But they such horror and such loathing bred,<BR>
He shrieks, he groans, and gladly would be dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
By gloomiest track and blindest path he still<BR>
Threaded the tangled forest here and there;<BR>
By thorniest valley and by roughest hill,<BR>
And wheresoever darkest was the air;<BR>
Thus hoping to have rid him of that ill,<BR>
Hideous, abominable, poisonous Care;<BR>
Beneath whose gripe he foully might have fared,<BR>
But that one quickly to his aid repaired.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
But aid, and in good time, a horseman bore,<BR>
Equipt with arms of beauteous steel and clear:<BR>
For crest, a broken yoke the stranger wore;<BR>
Red flames upon his yellow shield appear:<BR>
So was the courser&#8217;s housing broidered o&#8217;er,<BR>
As the proud surcoat of the cavalier.<BR>
His lance he grasped, his sword was in its place,<BR>
And at his saddle hung a burning mace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
That warrior&#8217;s mace a fire eternal fills,<BR>
Whose lasting fuel ever blazes bright;<BR>
And goodly buckler, tempered corslet thrills,<BR>
And solid helm; then needs the approaching knight<BR>
Must make him way, wherever &#8217;tis his will<BR>
To turn his inextinguishable light.<BR>
Nor of less help in need Rinaldo stands,<BR>
To save him from the cruel monster&#8217;s hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
The stranger horseman, like a warrior bold,<BR>
Where he that hubbub hears, doth thither swoop,<BR>
Until he sees the beast, whose snakes enfold<BR>
Rinaldo, linked in many a loathsome loop,<BR>
Who sweats at once with heat and quakes with cold,<BR>
Nor can he thrust the monster from his croup.<BR>
Arrived the stranger smote her in the flank,<BR>
Who on the near side of the courser sank:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
But scarcely was on earth extended, ere<BR>
She rose and shook her snakes in volumed spire.<BR>
The knight no more assails her with the spear;<BR>
But is resolved to plague the foe with fire:<BR>
He gripes the mace and thunders in her rear<BR>
With frequent blows, like tempest in its ire;<BR>
Nor leaves a moment to that monster fell<BR>
To strike one stroke in answer, ill or well;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
And, while he chases her or holds at bay,<BR>
Smites her and venges many a foul affront,<BR>
Counsels the paladin, without delay,<BR>
To take the road which scales the neighbouring mount:<BR>
He took that proffered counsel and that way,<BR>
And without stop, or turning back his front,<BR>
Pricked furiously till he was out of sight;<BR>
Though hard to clamber was the rugged height.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
The stranger, when he to her dark retreat<BR>
Had driven from upper light that beast of hell<BR>
(Where she herself doth ever gnaw and eat,<BR>
While from her thousand eyes tears ceaseless well)<BR>
Followed the knight, to guide his wandering feet;<BR>
And overtook him on the highest swell;<BR>
Then placed himself beside the cavalier<BR>
Him from those dark and gloomy parts to steer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
When him returned beheld Montalban&#8217;s knight,<BR>
That countless thanks were due to him, he said,<BR>
And that at all times, as a debt of right,<BR>
His life should be for his advantage paid.<BR>
Of him he next demands, how he is hight,<BR>
That he may know and tell who brought him aid;<BR>
And among worthy warriors, and before<BR>
King Charles, exalt his prowess evermore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
The stranger answered: &#8220;Let it irk not thee<BR>
That I not now my name to thee display;<BR>
Ere longer by a yard the shadows be,<BR>
This will I signify; a short delay.&#8221;<BR>
Wending together, they a river see<BR>
Whose murmurs woo the traveller from his way,<BR>
And shepherd-swain, by whiles, to their green brink;<BR>
There an oblivion of their love to drink.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
My lord, that fountain&#8217;s chilling stream and clear<BR>
Extinguished love; Angelica of yore<BR>
Drinking thereof, for good Montalban&#8217;s peer<BR>
Conceived that hate she nourished evermore;<BR>
And if she once displeased the cavalier,<BR>
And he to her such passing hatred bore,<BR>
For this no other cause occasion gave,<BR>
My lord, save drinking of this chilly wave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Arriving at that limpid river&#8217;s side,<BR>
The cavalier that with Rinaldo goes,<BR>
Reined-in his courser, how with toil, and cried,<BR>
&#8220;Here &#8217;twere not ill, meseemeth, to repose.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;It cannot but be well&#8221; (the peer replied),<BR>
&#8220;Because, beside that mid-day fiercely glows,<BR>
I have so suffered from that hideous Pest,<BR>
As sweet and needful shall I welcome rest.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Upon the green sward lit the martial two,<BR>
While their loose horses through the forest fed;<BR>
And from their brows the burnished helmets threw<BR>
On that flowered herbage, yellow, green, and red.<BR>
Rinaldo to the liquid crystal flew,<BR>
By heat and thirst unto the river sped;<BR>
And with one draught of that cold liquid drove<BR>
Out of his burning bosom thirst and love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Whenas Rinaldo, sated with the draught,<BR>
Raising his head the stranger knight espied,<BR>
And saw that he, repentant, every thought<BR>
Of that so frantic love had put aside,<BR>
He reared himself, and said with semblance haught<BR>
That which he would not say before, and cried:<BR>
&#8220;Rinaldo, know that I am hight Disdain,<BR>
Bound hither but to break thy worthless chain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
So saying, suddenly he passed from sight;<BR>
With him his horse: this in Rinaldo bred<BR>
Much wonderment; and the astonished knight,<BR>
&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; gazing round about him, said.<BR>
He cannot guess if &#8217;twere a magic sprite,<BR>
A fiend by Malagigi thither sped,<BR>
From those his ministers, to break the chain,<BR>
Fettered whereby he lived so long in pain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Of if an angel from the heavenly sphere<BR>
In his ineffable goodness by the Lord,<BR>
Dispatched, as to Tobias&#8217;s aid whilere,<BR>
A medicine for his blindness to afford.<BR>
But good or evil angel&#8212;whatsoe&#8217;er<BR>
He was that him to liberty restored&#8212;<BR>
Him thanked and praised Rinaldo, for a heart<BR>
Healed only by his help of amorous smart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Old hate revived upon Rinaldo&#8217;s side;<BR>
Nor he alone unworthy to be wooed,<BR>
The damsel deemed by pilgrimage so wide<BR>
Her half a league he would not have pursued.<BR>
Nathless anew Bayardo to bestride<BR>
To Sericane would go that warrior good:<BR>
As well because his honour him compelled,<BR>
As for the talk which he with Charles had held.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
He pricked to Basle upon the following day,<BR>
Whither the tidings had arrived before:<BR>
That Count Orlando was, in martial fray,<BR>
To meet Gradasso and the royal Moor:<BR>
Nor through Orlando was divulged that say:<BR>
But one, who crost from the Sicilian shore,<BR>
And thither had, in haste, the journey made,<BR>
As certain news, the tidings had conveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo had gladly been at Roland&#8217;s side,<BR>
And from that battle far himself doth see:<BR>
Every ten miles he changes horse and guide,<BR>
And whips and spurs, and makes his courser flee.<BR>
He crost the Rhine at Constance, forward hied,<BR>
He traversed Alp, arrived in Italy,<BR>
He left Verona, Mantua, in his rear,<BR>
And reached and past the Po, with swift career.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Much towards eve already sloped the sun,<BR>
And the first star was glimmering in the sky,<BR>
When, doubting on the bank if he shall run<BR>
Another course, or in some hostel lie<BR>
Until the shades of night and vapours dun<BR>
Before Aurora&#8217;s beauteous visage fly,<BR>
A cavalier approaching him he viewed,<BR>
Who courtesy in face and semblance shewed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
He, after greeting him, if he were tied<BR>
In wedlock, made in gentle wise demand.<BR>
Rinaldo, wondering what the quest implied,<BR>
Made answer: &#8220;I am bound in nuptial band.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;I joy thereat,&#8221; the cavalier replied;<BR>
Then, that he might this saying understand,<BR>
Added, &#8220;I pray that you, sir knight, within<BR>
My mansion will this eve be pleased to inn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For I will make you see what must please<BR>
A wight&#8221; (pursued the stranger) &#8220;that is wed.&#8221;<BR>
Rinaldo, as well that he would take his ease,<BR>
&#8212;But this, with so long posting sore bested&#8212;<BR>
As that to see and hear strange novelties<BR>
By natural desire he still was led,<BR>
His offer takes, and enters a new road,<BR>
Following that cavalier to his abode.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
A bowshot from the way diverged the two,<BR>
And a great palace fronting them descried:<BR>
Whence squires with blazing lights (a numerous crew)<BR>
Issued, and chased the darkness far and wide.<BR>
Entering, his eyes around Rinaldo threw,<BR>
And saw a place, whose like is seldom spied,<BR>
Of beauteous fabric, and well ordered plan;<BR>
Nor such huge cost befitted private man.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Of serpentine and of hard porphyry are<BR>
The stones which form the gateway&#8217;s arch above.<BR>
Of bronze the portal leaves, which figures bear,<BR>
Whose lively features seem to breathe and move.<BR>
Beneath the vaulted entry, colours rare<BR>
Cheating the eye, in mixt mosaic strove,<BR>
The quadrangle within was galleried,<BR>
And of a hundred yards, on every side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
A gateway is there to each galleried row,<BR>
And, twixt it and that gate, an arch is bent;<BR>
Of equal breadth, but different in their show,<BR>
For the architect had spared not ornament.<BR>
Each arch an entrance was; up which might go<BR>
A laden horse; so easy the ascent.<BR>
To arch above leads every stair withal,<BR>
And every arch is entrance to a hall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Above, project the arches in such sort,<BR>
They for the spacious portals form a shade;<BR>
And each two pillars has for its support:<BR>
Of bronze are some, and some of marble made.<BR>
The ornamented chambers of the court<BR>
Too many are to be at length displayed;<BR>
With easements, which (beside what is in sight)<BR>
The skilful master underground had dight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Tall columns, with their capitals of gold,<BR>
Which gemmed entablatures support in air;<BR>
Exotic marbles engraved with figures fair;<BR>
Picture and cast, and works so manifold,<BR>
Albeit by night they mostly hidden were,<BR>
Showed that two kings&#8217; united treasure ne&#8217;er<BR>
Would have sufficed such gorgeous pile to rear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Above the beauteous ornaments and rich<BR>
That mingled in that gay quadrangle meet,<BR>
There is a fresh and plenteous fountain, which<BR>
Scatters in many threads its watery sheet,<BR>
&#8217;Tis here that youths at equal distance pitch,<BR>
I&#8217; the middle, tables for the festive treat.<BR>
Whence they four gates of that rich mansion see,<BR>
And seen from those four gates as well may be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
By cunning master, diligent and wise,<BR>
With much and subtle toil, the fount was made:<BR>
In open gallery or pavilion&#8217;s guise;<BR>
Which from eight separate fronts, projects a shade.<BR>
A gilded roof, which with enamelled dyes<BR>
Was stained below, the building overlayed.<BR>
Eight marble statues (snowy was the grain),<BR>
With the left arm that gilded roof sustain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Fair Amalthaea&#8217;s horn in the right hand<BR>
Had quaintly sculptured the ingenious master,<BR>
Whence water, trickling forth with murmur bland,<BR>
Descends into a vase of alabaster;<BR>
And he, in likeness of a lady grand,<BR>
With sovereign art had fashioned each pilaster.<BR>
Various they were in visage and in vest,<BR>
But all of equal charms and grace possest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Upon two beauteous images below<BR>
Each of these female statues fix their feet.<BR>
The lower seem with open mouth to show<BR>
That song and harmony to them are sweet;<BR>
And, by their attitude, &#8217;twould seem, as though<BR>
Their every work and every study meet<BR>
In praising them, they on their shoulders bear,<BR>
As they would those whose likenesses they wear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
The images below them in their hand<BR>
Long scrolls and of an ample size contain,<BR>
Which of the worthiest figures of that band<BR>
The several names with mickle praise explain<BR>
As well their own at little distance stand,<BR>
Inscribed upon that scroll, in letters plain,<BR>
Rinaldo, by the help of blazing lights,<BR>
Marked, one by one, the ladies and their knights.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
The first inscription there which meets the eye<BR>
Recites at length Lucretia Borgia&#8217;s fame,<BR>
Whom Rome should place, for charms and chastity,<BR>
Above that wife who whilom bore her name.<BR>
Strozza and Tebaldeo&#8212;Anthony<BR>
And Hercules&#8212;support the honoured dame:<BR>
(So says the scroll): for tuneful strain, the pair<BR>
A very Linus and an Orpheus are.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
A statue no less jocund, no less bright,<BR>
Succeeds, and on the writing is impressed;<BR>
Lo! Hercules&#8217; daughter, Isabella hight,<BR>
In whom Ferrara deems her city blest,<BR>
Much more because she first shall see the light<BR>
Within its circuit, than for all the rest<BR>
Which kind and favouring Fortune in the flow<BR>
Of rolling years, shall on that town bestow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
The pair that such desirous ardour shew<BR>
That aye her praises should be widely blown:<BR>
John James alike are named: of those fair two,<BR>
One is Calandra, one is Bardelon.<BR>
In the third place, and fourth, where trickling through<BR>
Small rills, the water quits that octagon,<BR>
Two ladies are there, equal in their birth,<BR>
Equal in country, honour, charms and worth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
One was Elizabeth, one Eleanor,<BR>
And if we credit what that marble said,<BR>
Manto&#8217;s so glorious city which such store<BR>
Sets my melodious Maro, whom she bred,<BR>
More vaunts not him, nor reverences more,<BR>
Than these fair dames her poet&#8217;s honoured head.<BR>
The first of these her hallowed feet had set<BR>
On Peter Bembo and James Sadolet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Arelio and Castiglion, a polished pair,<BR>
That other lady, in mid air, sustain.<BR>
Their names were carved upon the marble fair,<BR>
Then both unknown, and now so fames a twain.<BR>
Next was a lady, that from Heaven shall heir<BR>
As mighty virtue as on earth doth reign,<BR>
Or ever yet hath reigned, in any age,<BR>
Well proved by Fortune in her love or rage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Inscribed in characters of gold is here<BR>
Lucretia Bentivoglia, and among<BR>
Her praises, &#8217;tis declared Ferrara&#8217;s peer<BR>
Joys that such daughter doth to him belong.<BR>
Her shall Camillus voice, and far and near<BR>
Reno and Felsina shall hear his song,<BR>
Wrapt in as mighty wonder at the strain<BR>
As that wherewith Amphrysus heard his swain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
And one, through whom that city&#8217;s name (where sweet<BR>
Isaurus salts his wave in larger vase)<BR>
Fame shall from Africa to Ind repeat,<BR>
From southern tracts to Hyperborean ways,<BR>
More than because Rome&#8217;s gold in that famed seat<BR>
Was weighed, whereof perpetual record says<BR>
Guy Posthumus&#8212;about whose honoured brow<BR>
Ph&#339;bus and Pallas bind a double bough.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Dian is next in order of that train.<BR>
&#8220;Regard not (said the marble) is she wear<BR>
A haughty port; for in her heart, humane<BR>
The matron is, as in her visage, fair.<BR>
Learned Celio Calcagnine in lofty strain<BR>
Her glories and fair name abroad shall bear,<BR>
And Juba&#8217;s and Moneses&#8217; kingdom hear,<BR>
And Spain and farthest Ind, his trumpet clear;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
And a Cavallo shall make such a font<BR>
Of poetry in famed Ancona run,<BR>
As that winged courser on Parnassus&#8217; mount;<BR>
Or was it on the hill of Helicon?<BR>
&#8217;Tis Beatrice, who next uprears her front,<BR>
Whereof so speaks the writing on the stone:<BR>
&#8220;Her consort Beatrice, while she has breath,<BR>
Blesses, and leaves unhappy at her death;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yea, Italy; that with her triumphs bright,<BR>
Without that lady fair shall captive be.&#8221;<BR>
A lofty song appears of her to indite<BR>
A lord of the Correggio&#8217;s noble tree;<BR>
And, Benedeo&#8217;s pride, Timotheus hight.<BR>
Between his banks, descending to the sea,<BR>
By their joint music shall the stream be stopt,<BR>
Whose trees erewhile the liquid amber dropt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Between this and that lofty column&#8217;s place<BR>
Into fair Borgia fashioned (as was said)<BR>
Of aspect so distinguished, of such grace,<BR>
A lady was, of alabaster made,<BR>
That, hiding in a simple veil her face,<BR>
In sable, without gems or gold arraid,<BR>
She, &#8217;mid the brightest, flung her light as far,<BR>
As amid lesser fires the Cyprian star.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
None knows, observing her with steadfast view,<BR>
If she of charms or grace have fuller store,<BR>
Whether her visage most majestic shew,<BR>
Or beam with genius or with beauty more.<BR>
&#8220;He that would speak&#8212;would speak her praises true&#8212;<BR>
(Declares in fine the sculptured marble&#8217;s lore)<BR>
The fairest of emprizes would intend,<BR>
But never bring his noble task to end.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Albeit such grace and passing sweetness shewed<BR>
Her fair and well wrought image, she disdain<BR>
Appeared to nurse, that one of wit so rude<BR>
Should dare to sing her praise in humble strain,<BR>
As he that only without comrade stood,<BR>
I know not why, her statue to sustain,<BR>
The marble all those other names revealed.<BR>
That pair&#8217;s alone the artist had concealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
The statues in the middle form a round,<BR>
The floor whereof dry stalks of coral pave;<BR>
Most pleasant, cool, and grateful, is that ground;<BR>
So rendered by the pure and crystal wave.<BR>
Which vent without in other channel found;<BR>
And issued forth in many a stream, to lave<BR>
A mead of azure, white, and yellow hue;<BR>
Gladdening the plants that on their margins grew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Conversing with his courteous host, the peer<BR>
Sate at the board, and oft and often prayed,<BR>
That without more delay the cavalier<BR>
Would keep the promise he whilere had made;<BR>
And marking, ever and anon, his cheer,<BR>
Observes his heart with some deep woe downweighed.<BR>
For not a moment &#8217;mid their converse slips,<BR>
But what a burning sigh is on his lips.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
Oft with desire was good Rinaldo stung<BR>
To ask that sorrow&#8217;s cause, and the request<BR>
Was almost on the gentle warrior&#8217;s tongue,<BR>
And there by courteous modesty represt.<BR>
Now at their banquet&#8217;s close a youth, among<BR>
The menial crew, on whom that charge did rest,<BR>
Placed a gold cup before the paladin,<BR>
Filled full of gems without, of wine within.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
The host then somedeal smiling, from the board<BR>
Looked up at Aymon&#8217;s son; but who this while<BR>
Well marked him, as he eyed Montalban&#8217;s lord,<BR>
Had deemed him more disposed to weep than smile.<BR>
&#8220;So oft reminded, to maintain my word,<BR>
&#8217;Tis time meseems (said he, that owned the pile)<BR>
To shew the touchstone for a woman&#8217;s love,<BR>
Which needs to wedded man must welcome prove.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ne&#8217;er, in my judgment, should the married dame<BR>
Be from espial by her lord released;<BR>
Thus shall he know if honour or if blame<BR>
His portion is; if he is man or beast.<BR>
The weight of horns, though coupled with such shame,<BR>
Is of all burdens upon the earth the least.<BR>
While well-nigh all behold his antlers spread,<BR>
He feels them not who has them on his head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If certain of thy wife&#8217;s fidelity,<BR>
Thou hast more ground to prize and hold her dear<BR>
Than one, whose wife is evil known to be,<BR>
Or husband that is still in doubt and fear.<BR>
Full many husbands live in jealousy,<BR>
And groundlessly, of women chaste and clear.<BR>
On many women many men rely<BR>
Meanwhile, who bear their branching antlers high.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If thou would&#8217;st be assured thy wife is true<BR>
(As sure methinks thou thinkest and must think)<BR>
For it is hard that notion to undo,<BR>
Unless thy trust before sure tokens sink,<BR>
&#8212;No hearsay matter this&#8212;thyself shalt view<BR>
The truth, if thou in this fair vessel drink,<BR>
Placed solely on the supper-board, that thou<BR>
May&#8217;st see the marvel promised thee but now.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Drink, and a mighty marvel shall be seen;<BR>
For if thou wearest Cornwall&#8217;s lofty crest,<BR>
No drop of wine shall pass thy lips between,<BR>
And all the draught be spilt upon thy breast.<BR>
If faithful is thy wife, thou shalt drink clean.<BR>
And now&#8212;to try thy fortune&#8212;to the test!&#8221;<BR>
He said, and with fixt eyes the sign explored;<BR>
If on his breast the wine Rinaldo poured.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo was nigh moved the cup to raise,<BR>
And seek what he would haply wish unsought:<BR>
Forward he reached his hand and took the vase,<BR>
About to prove his fortune in the draught.<BR>
Then of the passing peril of the case,<BR>
Before it touched his lips, the warrior thought.<BR>
But let me, sir, repose myself, and I<BR>
Will then relate the Paladin&#8217;s reply.</TD></TR>
