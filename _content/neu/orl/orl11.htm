<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Assisted by the magic ring she wears,<BR>
Angelica evanishes from view.<BR>
Next in a damsel, whom a giant bears<BR>
Beneath his arm, his bride Rogero true<BR>
Beholds. Orlando to the shore repairs,<BR>
Where the fell orc so many damsels slew;<BR>
Olympia frees, and spoils the beast of life:<BR>
Her afterwards Oberto takes to wife.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Although a feeble rein, in mid career,<BR>
Will oft suffice to stop courageous horse;<BR>
&#8217;Tis seldom Reason&#8217;s bit will serve to steer<BR>
Desire, or turn him from his furious course,<BR>
When pleasure is in reach: like headstrong bear,<BR>
Whom from the honeyed meal &#8217;tis ill to force,<BR>
If once he scent the tempting mess, or sup<BR>
A drop, which hangs upon the luscious cup.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
What reason then Rogero shall withhold<BR>
From taking with Angelica delight,&#8212;<BR>
That gentle maid, there naked in his hold,<BR>
In the lone forest, and secure from sight?<BR>
Of Bradamant he thinks not, who controlled<BR>
His bosom erst: and foolish were the knight,<BR>
If thinking of that damsel as before,<BR>
By this he had not set an equal store;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Warmed by whose youthful beauties, the severe<BR>
Xenocrates would not have been more chaste.<BR>
The impatient Child had dropt both shield and spear,<BR>
And hurrying now his other arms uncased;<BR>
When, casting down her eyes in shame and fear,<BR>
The virtuous ring upon her finger placed,<BR>
Angelica descried, and which of yore<BR>
From her Brunello in Albracca bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
This is the ring she carried into France,<BR>
When thither first the damsel took her way;<BR>
With her the brother, bearer of the lance,<BR>
After, the paladin, Astolpho&#8217;s prey.<BR>
With this she Malagigi&#8217;s spells and trance<BR>
Made vain by Merlin&#8217;s stair; and on a day<BR>
Orlando freed, with many knights and good,<BR>
From Dragontina&#8217;s cruel servitude:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
With this passed viewless from the turret-cell,<BR>
Where her that bad old man had mewed; but why<BR>
Recount its different wonders, if as well<BR>
You know the virtues of the ring as I?<BR>
From her this even in her citadel,<BR>
His monarch Agramant to satisfy,<BR>
Brunello took: since where she had been crost<BR>
By Fortune, till her native realm was lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Now that she this upon her hand surveys,<BR>
She is so full of pleasure and surprise,<BR>
She doubts it is a dream, and, in amaze,<BR>
Hardly believes her very hand and eyes.<BR>
Then softly to her mouth the hoop conveys,<BR>
And, quicker than the flash which cleaves the skies,<BR>
From bold Rogero&#8217;s sight her beauty shrowds,<BR>
As disappears the sun, concealed in clouds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Yet still Rogero gazed like wight distraught,<BR>
And hurried here and there with fruitless speed:<BR>
But when he had recalled the ring to thought,<BR>
Foiled and astounded, cursed his little heed.<BR>
And now the vanished lady, whom he sought,<BR>
Of that ungrateful and discourteous deed<BR>
Accusing stood, wherewith she had repaid,<BR>
(Unfitting recompense) his generous aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ungrateful damsel! and is this the pay<BR>
You render for the service done?&#8221; (said he)<BR>
&#8220;Why rather would you steal my ring away<BR>
Than have it as a welcome gift from me?<BR>
Not only this, (but use me as you may)<BR>
I, and my shield and courser, yours shall be;<BR>
So you no more conceal your beauteous cheer.<BR>
Cruel, though answering not, I know you hear.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
So saying, like one blind, with bootless care,<BR>
Feeling his way about the fount he strayed.<BR>
How often he embraced the empty air,<BR>
Hoping in this to have embraced the maid!<BR>
Meanwhile, now far removed, the flying fair<BR>
Had halted not, till to a cave conveyed.<BR>
Formed in a mountain was that harbour rude;<BR>
Spacious, and for her need supplied with food.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas here an aged herdsman, one who tended<BR>
A numerous troop of mares, had made his won:<BR>
These, seeking pasture, through the valley wended,<BR>
Where the green grass was fed by freshening run:<BR>
While stalls on either side the cave, defended<BR>
His charge from the oppressive noon-tide sun;<BR>
Angelica, within, that livelong day,<BR>
Unseen of prying eyes, prolonged her stay;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
And about evening, when refreshed with rest<BR>
And food, she deemed her course she might renew;<BR>
In certain rustic weeds her body dressed:<BR>
How different from those robes of red, or blue,<BR>
Green, yellow, purple, her accustomed vest,<BR>
So various in its fashion, shape, and hue!<BR>
Yet her not so that habit misbecame,<BR>
But that she looked the fair and noble dame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Then Phillis&#8217; and Neaera&#8217;s praise forbear,<BR>
And ye who sing of Amaryllis cease,<BR>
Or flying Galataea, not so fair,<BR>
Tityrus and Melibaeus, with your peace!<BR>
&#8217;Twas here the beauteous lady took a mare,<BR>
Which liked her best, of all that herd&#8217;s increase.<BR>
Then, and then first conceived the thought, again<BR>
To seek in the Levant her antient reign.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
This while Rogero, after he had passed<BR>
Long space in hope the maid might re-appear,<BR>
Awakened from his foolish dream at last,<BR>
And found she was not nigh, and did not hear.<BR>
Then to remount his griffin-courser cast,<BR>
In earth and air accustomed to career.<BR>
But, having slipt his bit, the winged horse<BR>
Had towered and soared in air a freer course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
To his first ill addition grave and sore<BR>
Was to have lost the bird of rapid wing,<BR>
Which he no better than the mockery bore<BR>
Put on him by the maid; but deeper sting<BR>
Than this or that, implants, and pains him more,<BR>
The thought of having lost the precious ring;<BR>
Not for its power so much, esteemed above<BR>
Its worth, as given him by his lady love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Afflicted beyond measure, he, with shield<BR>
Cast on his shoulder, and new-cased in mail,<BR>
Left the sea-side, and through a grassy field<BR>
Pursued his way, towards a spacious vale:<BR>
Where he beheld a path, by wood concealed,<BR>
The widest and most beaten in the dale.<BR>
Nor far had wound the closest shades within,<BR>
Ere on his right he heard a mighty din.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
He heard a din, and fearful clashing sound<BR>
Of arms, and hurrying on with eager pace<BR>
&#8217;Twixt tree and tree, two furious champions found,<BR>
Waging fierce fight in close and straightened place:<BR>
Who to each other (warring on what ground<BR>
I know not) neither showed regard nor grace.<BR>
The one a giant was of haughty cheer,<BR>
And one a bold and gallant cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Covered with shield and sword, one, leaping, sped<BR>
Now here now there, and thus himself defended,<BR>
Lest a two-handed mace upon his head<BR>
Should fall, with which the giant still offended:&#8212;<BR>
On the field lay his horse, already dead.<BR>
Rogero paused, and to the strife attended:<BR>
And straight his wishes leant towards the knight,<BR>
Whom he would fain see conqueror in the fight:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Yet not for this would lend the champion aid,<BR>
But to behold the cruel strife stood nigh.<BR>
Lo! a two-handed stroke the giant made<BR>
Upon the lesser warrior&#8217;s casque, and by<BR>
The mighty blow the knight was overlaid:<BR>
The other, when astound he saw him lie,<BR>
To deal the foe his death, his helm untied,<BR>
So that the warrior&#8217;s face Rogero spied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Of his sweet lady, of his passing fair,<BR>
And dearest Bradamant Rogero spies<BR>
The lovely visage of its helmet bare;<BR>
Towards whom, to deal her death, the giant hies:<BR>
So that, advancing with his sword in air,<BR>
To sudden battle him the Child defies,<BR>
But he, who will not wait for new alarm,<BR>
Takes the half-lifeless lady in his arm,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
And on his shoulder flings and bears away;<BR>
As sometimes wolf a little lamb will bear,<BR>
Or eagle in her crooked claws convey<BR>
Pigeon, or such-like bird, through liquid air.<BR>
Rogero runs with all the speed he may,<BR>
Who sees how needed is his succour there.<BR>
But with such strides the giant scours the plain,<BR>
Him with his eyes the knight pursues with pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
This flying and that following, the two<BR>
Kept a close path which widened still, and they<BR>
Piercing that forest, issued forth to view<BR>
On a wide meadow, which without it lay.<BR>
&#8212;No more of this. Orlando I pursue,<BR>
That bore Cymosco&#8217;s thunder-bolt away;<BR>
And this had in the deepest bottom drowned,<BR>
That never more the mischief might be found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
But with small boot: for the impious enemy<BR>
Of human nature, taught the bolt to frame,<BR>
After the shaft, which darting from the sky<BR>
Pierces the cloud and comes to ground in flame,<BR>
Who, when he tempted Eve to eat and die<BR>
With the apple, hardly wrought more scathe and shame,<BR>
Some deal before, or in our grandsires&#8217; day,<BR>
Guided a necromancer where it lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
More than a hundred fathom buried so,<BR>
Where hidden it had lain a mighty space,<BR>
The infernal tool by magic from below<BR>
Was fished and born amid the German race;<BR>
Who, by one proof and the other, taught to know<BR>
Its powers, and he who plots for our disgrace,<BR>
The demon, working on their weaker wit,<BR>
As last upon its fatal purpose hit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
To Italy and France, on every hand<BR>
The cruel art among all people past:<BR>
And these the bronze in hollow mould expand,<BR>
First in the furnace melted by the blast:<BR>
Others the iron bore, and small or grand,<BR>
Fashion the various tube they pierce or cast.<BR>
And bombard, gun, according to its frame,<BR>
Or single cannon this, or double, name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
This saker, culverine, or falcon hight,<BR>
I hear (all names the inventor has bestowed);<BR>
Which splits or shivers steel and stone outright,<BR>
And, where the bullet passes, makes a road.<BR>
&#8212;Down to the sword, restore thy weapons bright,<BR>
Sad soldier, to the forge, a useless load;<BR>
And gun or carbine on thy shoulder lay,<BR>
Who without these, I wot, shalt touch no pay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
How, foul and pestilent discovery,<BR>
Didst thou find place within the human heart?<BR>
Through thee is martial glory lost, through thee<BR>
The trade of arms became a worthless art:<BR>
And at such ebb are worth and chivalry,<BR>
That the base often plays the better part.<BR>
Through thee no more shall gallantry, no more<BR>
Shall valour prove their prowess as of yore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Through thee, alas! are dead, or have to die,<BR>
So many noble lords and cavaliers<BR>
Before this war shall end, which, Italy<BR>
Afflicting most, has drowned the world in tears,<BR>
That, if I said the word, I err not, I,<BR>
Saying he sure the cruellest appears<BR>
And worst, of nature&#8217;s impious and malign,<BR>
Who did this hateful engine first design:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
And I shall think, in order to pursue<BR>
The sin for ever, God has doomed to hell<BR>
That cursed soul, amid the unhappy crew,<BR>
Beside the accursed Judas there to dwell.<BR>
But follow we the good Orlando, who<BR>
So burns to seek Ebuda&#8217;s island fell,<BR>
Whose foul inhabitants a monster sate<BR>
With flesh of women, fair and delicate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
But no less slow than eager was the knight:<BR>
The winds appear, which still his course delay;<BR>
Who, whether blowing on the left or right,<BR>
Or poop, so faintly in his canvas play,<BR>
His bark makes little speed; and, spent outright,<BR>
The breeze which wafts her sometimes dies away,<BR>
Or blows so foul, that he is fain to steer<BR>
Another course, or to the leeward veer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
It was the will of Heaven that he, before<BR>
The King of Ireland, should not reach the land,<BR>
The he with greater ease upon that shore<BR>
Might act what shortly you shall understand.<BR>
&#8220;Make for the isle. Now&#8221; (said he) &#8220;may&#8217;st thou moor,&#8221;<BR>
(Thus issuing to the pilot his command),<BR>
&#8220;And give me for my need the skiff; for I<BR>
Will to the rock without more company.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The biggest cable that thou hast aboard,<BR>
And biggest anchor to my hands consign;<BR>
Thou shalt perceive why thus my boat is stored,<BR>
If I but meet that monster of the brine.&#8221;<BR>
He bade them lower the pinnace overboard,<BR>
With all things that befitted his design:<BR>
His arms he left behind, except his blade,<BR>
And singly for the rocky island made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Home to his breast the count pulls either oar,<BR>
With the island at his back, to which he wends,<BR>
In guise that, crawling up the sandy shore,<BR>
The crooked crab from sea or marsh ascends.<BR>
It was the hour Aurora gay before<BR>
The rising sun her yellow hair extends<BR>
(His orb as yet half-seen, half-hid from sight)<BR>
Not without stirring jealous Tithon&#8217;s spite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
Approaching to the naked rock as near<BR>
As vigorous hand might serve to cast a stone,<BR>
He knew not if he heard, or did not hear<BR>
A cry, so faint and feeble was the moan.<BR>
When, turning to the left, the cavalier,<BR>
His level sight along the water thrown,<BR>
Naked as born, bound to a stump, espied<BR>
A dame whose feet were wetted by the tide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Because she distant is, and evermore<BR>
Holds down her face, he ill can her discern:<BR>
Both sculls he pulls amain, and nears the shore,<BR>
With keen desire more certain news to learn:<BR>
But now the winding beach is heard to roar,<BR>
And wood and cave the mighty noise return;<BR>
The billows swell, and, lo! the beast! who pressed,<BR>
And nigh concealed the sea beneath his breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
As cloud from humid vale is seen to rise,<BR>
Pregnant with rain and storm, which seems withal<BR>
To extinguished day, and charged with deeper dyes<BR>
Than night, to spread throughout this earthly ball,<BR>
So swims the beast, who so much occupies<BR>
Of sea, he may be said to keep it all.<BR>
Waves roar: collected in himself, the peer<BR>
Looks proudly on, unchanged in heart and cheer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
He, as one well resolved in his intent,<BR>
Moved quickly to perform the feat he planned;<BR>
And, for he would the damsel&#8217;s harm prevent,<BR>
And would with that assail the beast at hand,<BR>
Between her and the orc the boat he sent,<BR>
Leaving within the sheath his idle brand,<BR>
Anchor and cable next he takes in hold,<BR>
And waits the foe with constant heart and bold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
As soon as him the monster has descried,<BR>
And skiff at little interval, his throat<BR>
The fish, to swallow him, expands so wide,<BR>
That horse and horseman through his jaws might float.<BR>
Here Roland with the anchor, and beside<BR>
(Unless I am mistaken) with the boat<BR>
Plunged, and engulphed the parted teeth betwixt,<BR>
His anchor in the tongue and palate fixt;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
So that the monster could no longer drop<BR>
Or raise his horrid jaws, which this extends.<BR>
&#8217;Tis thus who digs the mine is wont to prop<BR>
The ground, and where he works the roof suspends,<BR>
Lest sudden ruin whelm him from atop,<BR>
While he incautiously his task intends.<BR>
Roland (so far apart was either hook)<BR>
But by a leap could reach the highest crook.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
The prop so placed, Orlando now secure<BR>
That the fell beast his mouth no more can close,<BR>
Unsheathes his sword, and, in that cave obscure,<BR>
Deals here and there, now thrusts, now trenchant blows.<BR>
As well as citadel, whose walls immure<BR>
The assailants, can defend her from her foes,<BR>
The monster, harassed by the war within,<BR>
Defends himself against the Paladin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Now floats the monstrous beast, o&#8217;ercome with pain,<BR>
Whose scaly flanks upon the waves expand;<BR>
And now descends into the deepest main,<BR>
Scowers at the bottom, and stirs up the sand.<BR>
The rising flood ill able to sustain,<BR>
The cavalier swims forth, and makes for land.<BR>
He leaves the anchor fastened in his tongue,<BR>
And grasps the rope which from the anchor hung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
So swimming till the island is attained,<BR>
With this towards the rock Orlando speeds:<BR>
He hawls the anchor home (a footing gained),<BR>
Pricked by whose double fluke, the monster bleeds.<BR>
The labouring orc to follow is constrained,<BR>
Dragged by that force which every force exceeds;<BR>
Which at a single sally more achieves<BR>
Than at ten turns the circling windlass heaves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
As a wild bull, about whose horn is wound<BR>
The unexpected noose, leaps here and there,<BR>
When he has felt the cord, and turns him round,<BR>
And rolls and rises, yet slips not the snare;<BR>
So from his pleasant seat and ancient bound,<BR>
Dragged by that arm and rope he cannot tear,<BR>
With thousands of strange wheels and thousand slides,<BR>
The monster follows where the cable guides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
This the red sea with reason would be hight<BR>
To-day, such streams of blood have changed its hue;<BR>
And where the monster lashed it in his spite,<BR>
The eye its bottom through the waves might view.<BR>
And now he splashed the sky, and dimmed the light<BR>
Of the clear sun, so high the water flew.<BR>
The noise re-echoing round, the distant shore<BR>
And wood and hill rebound the deafening roar.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Forth from his grotto aged Proteus hies,<BR>
And mounts above the surface at the sound;<BR>
And having seen Orlando dive, and rise<BR>
From the orc, and drag the monstrous fish to ground,<BR>
His scattered flock forgot, o&#8217;er ocean flies;<BR>
While so the din increases, that, astound,<BR>
Neptune bids yoke his dolphins, and that day<BR>
For distant Aethiopia posts away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
With Melicerta on her shoulders, weeping<BR>
Ino, and Nereids with dishevelled hair,<BR>
The Glauci, Tritons, and their fellows, leaping<BR>
They know not whither, speed, some here, some there.<BR>
Orlando draws to land, the billows sweeping,<BR>
That horrid fish, but might his labour spare:<BR>
For, with the torment worn, and travel sore,<BR>
The brute, exhausted, died, ere dragged ashore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Of the islanders had trooped no petty throng,<BR>
To witness that strange fight, who by a vain<BR>
And miserable superstition stung,<BR>
Esteemed such holy deed a work profane;<BR>
And said that this would be another wrong<BR>
To Proteus, and provoke his ire again;<BR>
Make him his herds pour forth upon the strand,<BR>
And with the whole old warfare vex the land;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
And that it better were to sue for peace,<BR>
First from the injured god, lest worse ensue;<BR>
And Proteus from his cruel hate would cease,<BR>
If they into the sea the offender threw.<BR>
As torch to torch gives fire, and lights increase,<BR>
Until the flame is spread the country through,<BR>
Even so from heart to heart the fury spread,<BR>
Which in the waves would doom Orlando dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
These, armed with sling or bow, upon the shore,<BR>
And these supplied with spear or sword descend;<BR>
And on each side, behind him and before,<BR>
Distant and near, as best they can, offend.<BR>
At such a brutal insult wonders sore<BR>
The peer, who sees that mischief they intend,<BR>
In vengeance for the cruel monster slain,<BR>
Whence he had glory hoped, and praise to gain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
But as the usage is of surly bear,<BR>
By sturdy Russ or Lithuanian led,<BR>
Little to heed the dogs in crowded fair,<BR>
Nor even at their yelps to turn his head,<BR>
The clamour of the churls assembled there<BR>
Orlando witnessed with as little dread;<BR>
Who knew that he the rout which threatened death,<BR>
Had power to scatter at a single breath:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
And speedily he made them yield him place,<BR>
When turned on them, he grasped his trenchant blade.<BR>
Misjudging of his worth, the foolish race<BR>
Deemed that he would have short resistance made;<BR>
Since him they saw no covering buckler brace,<BR>
Uncuirassed, nor in other arms arrayed;<BR>
But knew not that, from head to foot, a skin<BR>
More hard than diamond cased the Paladin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
What by Orlando others cannot do,<BR>
The knight by others can; at half a score<BR>
Of blows in all he thirty killed; by few<BR>
He passed that measure, if the strokes were more:<BR>
And had already turned him to undo<BR>
The naked lady, having cleared the shore,<BR>
When other larum sounds, and other cries<BR>
From a new quarter of the island rise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
While so the Paladin had kept in play<BR>
The barbarous islanders, upon that hand,<BR>
The men of Ireland, without let or fray,<BR>
Had poured from many quarters on the strand:<BR>
And now, without remorse or pity, slay<BR>
The inhabitants, through all the wasted land;<BR>
And, was it justice moved, or cruel rage,<BR>
Slaughter without regard to sex or age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Little or no defender the island-crew<BR>
Attempt; in part as taken unaware,<BR>
In part that in the little place are few,<BR>
And that those few without a purpose are.<BR>
&#8217;Mid sack and fire, the wasted country through,<BR>
The islanders are slain, and everwhere<BR>
The walls are upon earth in ruin spread,<BR>
Nor in the land is left a living head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
As if the mighty tumult which he hears,<BR>
And shriek and ruin had concerned him nought,<BR>
The naked rock the bold Orlando nears,<BR>
Where she was placed, to feed the monster brought.<BR>
He looks, and known to him the dame appears,<BR>
And more appears, when nigher her he sought:<BR>
Olympia she appears, and is indeed<BR>
Olympia, whose faith reaped so ill a meed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Wretched Olympia; whom, beside the scorn<BR>
Which Love put on her, Fortune too pursued,<BR>
Who sent the corsairs fell, which her had born<BR>
That very day to the island of Ebude.<BR>
She Roland recollects on his return<BR>
Landward; but, for the damsel naked stood,<BR>
Not only nought she to the warrior said,<BR>
But dared not raise her eyes, and dropt her head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Orlando asks what evil destiny<BR>
Her to that cruel island had conveyed<BR>
From where she in as much felicity<BR>
Was with her consort left as could be said:<BR>
&#8220;I know not (cried the weeping dame) if I<BR>
Have thanks to render thee for death delayed,<BR>
Or should lament me that, through means of thee,<BR>
This day did not my woes concluded see.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I have to thank thee that from death, too dread<BR>
And monstrous, thy good arm deliverance gave;<BR>
Which would have been too monstrous, had I fed<BR>
The beast, and in his belly found a grave:<BR>
But cannot thank thee that I am not dead,<BR>
Since death alone can me from misery save,<BR>
Well shall I thank thee for that wished relief,<BR>
Which can deliver me from every grief.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Next she related, with loud sobs and sighs,<BR>
How her false spouse betrayed her as she lay<BR>
Asleep, and how of pirates made the prize,<BR>
They bore her from the desert isle away.<BR>
And, as she spake, she turned her in the guise<BR>
Of Dian, framed by artists, who pourtray<BR>
Her carved or painted, as in liquid font<BR>
She threw the water in Actaeon&#8217;s front.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
For, as she can, her waist she hides, and breast,<BR>
More liberal of flowing flank and reins.<BR>
Roland desires his ship, to find a vest<BR>
To cover her, delivered from her chains:<BR>
While he is all intent upon this quest,<BR>
Oberto comes; Oberto, he that reigns<BR>
O&#8217;er Ireland&#8217;s people, who had understood<BR>
How lifeless lay the monster of the flood;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
And, swimming, how, amid the watery roar,<BR>
A knight a weighty anchor in his throat<BR>
Had fix&#8217;d, and so had dragged him to the shore,<BR>
As men against the current track a boat.<BR>
This while Oberto comes; who, if his lore,<BR>
Who told the tale, were true, desires to note;<BR>
While his invading army, far and wide,<BR>
Ebuda burn and waste on every side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Oberto, though the Paladin to sight<BR>
Was dripping, and with water foul and gore;<BR>
With gore, that from the orc, emerged to light,<BR>
Whom he had entered bodily, he bore,<BR>
He for the country knew the stranger knight<BR>
As he perused his face; so much the more,<BR>
That he had thought when told the tidings, none<BR>
Save Roland could such mighty fear have done;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Knew him, because a page of honour he<BR>
Had been in France, and for the crown, his right<BR>
Upon his father&#8217;s death, had crossed the sea<BR>
The year before. So often he the knight<BR>
Had seen, and had with him held colloquy,<BR>
Their times of meeting had been infinite.<BR>
He doffed his casque, with festive welcome pressed<BR>
Towards the count, and clasped him to the breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Orlando is no less rejoined to see<BR>
The king, than is the king that champion true.<BR>
After with friendly cheer and equal glee<BR>
Had once or twice embraced the noble two,<BR>
To Oberto Roland told the treachery<BR>
Which had been done the youthful dame, and who<BR>
Had done it,&#8212;false Bireno&#8212;that among<BR>
All men should least have sought to do her wrong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
To him he told the many proofs and clear<BR>
By which the dame&#8217;s affection had been tried;<BR>
And how she for Bireno kin and geer<BR>
Had lost, and would in fine for him have died.<BR>
And how he this could warrant, and appear<BR>
To vouch for much, as witness on her side.<BR>
While thus to him her griefs Orlando showed,<BR>
The lady&#8217;s shining eyes with tears o&#8217;erflowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Her face was such as sometimes in the spring<BR>
We see a doubtful sky, when on the plain<BR>
A shower descends, and the sun, opening<BR>
His cloudy veil, looks out amid the rain.<BR>
And as the nightingale then loves to sing<BR>
From branch of verdant stem her dulcet strain,<BR>
So in her beauteous tears his pinions bright<BR>
Love bathes, rejoicing in the chrystal light.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
The stripling heats his golden arrow&#8217;s head<BR>
At her bright eyes, then slacks the weapon&#8217;s glow<BR>
In streams, which falls between white flowers and red;<BR>
And, the shaft tempered, strongly draws his bow,<BR>
And roves at him, o&#8217;er whom no shield is spread,<BR>
Nor iron rind, nor double mail below;<BR>
Who, gazing on her tresses, eyes, and brow,<BR>
Feels that his heart is pierced, he knows not how.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Olympia&#8217;s beauties are of those most rare,<BR>
Nor is the forehead&#8217;s beauteous curve alone<BR>
Excellent, and her eyes and cheeks and hair,<BR>
Mouth, nose, and throat, and shoulders; but, so down<BR>
Descending from the lady&#8217;s bosom fair,<BR>
Parts which are wont to be concealed by gown,<BR>
Are such, as haply should be placed before<BR>
Whate&#8217;er this ample world contains in store.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
In whiteness they surpassed unsullied snow,<BR>
Smooth ivory to the touch: above were seen<BR>
Two rounding paps, like new-pressed milk in show,<BR>
Fresh-taken from its crate of rushes green;<BR>
The space betwixt was like the valley low,<BR>
Which oftentimes we see small hills between,<BR>
Sweet in its season, and now such as when<BR>
Winter with snows has newly filled the glen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
The swelling hips and haunches&#8217; symmetry,<BR>
The waist more clear than mirror&#8217;s polished grain,<BR>
And members seem of Phidias&#8217; turnery,<BR>
Or work of better hand and nicer pain.<BR>
As well to you of other parts should I<BR>
Relate, which she to hide desired in vain.<BR>
To sum the beauteous whole, from head to feet,<BR>
In her all loveliness is found complete.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
And had she in the Idaean glen unveiled<BR>
In ancient days before the Phrygian swain,<BR>
By how much heavenly Venus had prevailed<BR>
I know not, though her rivals strove in vain.<BR>
Nor haply had the youth for Sparta sailed,<BR>
To violate the hospitable reign;<BR>
But said: &#8220;With Menelaus let Helen rest!<BR>
No other prize I seek, of this possest&#8221;;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Or in Crotona dwelt, where the divine<BR>
Zeuxis in days of old his work projected,<BR>
To be the ornament of Juno&#8217;s shrine,<BR>
And hence so many naked dames collected;<BR>
And in one form perfection to combine,<BR>
Some separate charm from this or that selected,<BR>
He from no other model need have wrought.<BR>
Since joined in her were all the charms he sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
I do not think Bireno ever viewed<BR>
Naked that beauteous form; for sure it were<BR>
He never could have been so stern of mood,<BR>
As to have left her on that desert lair.<BR>
That Ireland&#8217;s king was fired I well conclude,<BR>
Nor hid the flame that he within him bare.<BR>
He strives to comfort her, and hope instill,<BR>
That future good shall end her present ill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
And her to Holland promises to bear,<BR>
And vows till she is to her state restored,<BR>
And just and memorable vengeance there<BR>
Achieved upon her perjured, traitor lord,<BR>
He never will unceasing war forbear,<BR>
Waged with all means that Ireland can afford;<BR>
And this with all his speed. He, up and down,<BR>
Meantime bids seek for female vest and gown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Now will it need to send in search of vest<BR>
Beyond the savage island&#8217;s narrow bound,<BR>
Since thither every day in such came dressed,<BR>
Some dame, to feed the beast, from countries round.<BR>
Nor long his followers there pursued the quest,<BR>
Ere many they of various fashions found.<BR>
So was Olympia clothed; while sad of mood<BR>
Was he, not so to clothe her as he wou&#8217;d.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
But never silk so choice or gold so fine<BR>
Did the industrious Florentine prepare,<BR>
Nor whosoever broiders gay design,<BR>
Though on his task be spent time, toil, and care,<BR>
Nor Lemnos&#8217; god, nor Pallas&#8217; art divine,<BR>
Form raiment worthy of those limbs so fair,<BR>
That King Oberto cannot choose but he<BR>
Recalls them at each turn to memory.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
To see that love so kindled by the dame,<BR>
On many grounds Orlando was content;<BR>
Who not alone rejoiced that such a shame<BR>
Put upon her, Bireno should repent;<BR>
But, that in the design on which he came,<BR>
He should be freed from grave impediment.<BR>
Not for Olympia thither had he made,<BR>
But, were his lady there, to lend her aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
To him, that there she was not, soon was clear,<BR>
But clear it was not if she had been there,<BR>
Or no; since of those islesmen, far and near,<BR>
One was not left the tidings to declare.<BR>
The following day they from the haven steer,<BR>
And all united in one squadron fare.<BR>
The Paladin with them to Ireland hies,<BR>
From whence to France the warrior&#8217;s passage lies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Scarcely a day in Ireland&#8217;s realm he spends:<BR>
And for no prayers his purposed end forbore:<BR>
Love, that in quest of his liege-lady sends<BR>
The knight upon this track, permits no more.<BR>
Departing, he Olympia recommends<BR>
To the Irish monarch, who to serve her swore:<BR>
Although this needed not; since he was bent<BR>
More than behoved, her wishes to content:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
So levied in few days his warlike band,<BR>
And (league with England&#8217;s kind and Scotland&#8217;s made)<BR>
In Holland and in Friesland left no land<BR>
To the false duke, so rapid was the raid.<BR>
And to rebel against that lord&#8217;s command<BR>
His Zealand stirred; nor he the war delayed,<BR>
Until by him Bireno&#8217;s blood was spilt:<BR>
A punishment that ill atoned his guilt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Oberto takes to wife Olympia fair,<BR>
And her of countess makes a puissant queen.<BR>
But be the Paladin again our care,<BR>
Who furrows , night and day, the billows green,<BR>
And strikes his sails in the same harbour, where<BR>
They to the wind erewhile unfurled had been<BR>
All armed, he on his Brigliadoro leaps,<BR>
And leaves behind him winds and briny deeps.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
The remnant of the winter, he with shield<BR>
And spear achieved things worthy to be shown,<BR>
I ween; but these were then so well concealed,<BR>
It is no fault of mine they are not blown;<BR>
For good Orlando was in fighting field,<BR>
Prompter to do, than make his prowess known.<BR>
Nor e&#8217;er was bruited action of the knight,<BR>
Save when some faithful witness was in sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
That winter&#8217;s remnant he so passed that feat<BR>
Of his was known not to the public ear;<BR>
But when within that animal discreet<BR>
Which Phryxus bore, the sun illumed the sphere,<BR>
And Zephyrus returning glad and sweet,<BR>
Brought back with him again the blooming year,<BR>
The wondrous deeds Orlando did in stower,<BR>
Appeared with the new grass and dainty flower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
From plain to hill, from champaign flat to shore,<BR>
Oppressed with grief and pain the County fares,<BR>
When a long cry, entering a forest hoar,<BR>
&#8212;A load lamenting smites upon his ears.<BR>
He grasps his brand and spurs his courser sore,<BR>
And swiftly pricks toward the sound he hears.<BR>
But I shall at another season say<BR>
What chanced, and may be heard in future lay.</TD></TR>
