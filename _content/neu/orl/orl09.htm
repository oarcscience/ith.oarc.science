<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
So far Orlando wends, he comes to where<BR>
He of old Proteus&#8217; hears the cruel use<BR>
But feels such pity for Olympia fair,<BR>
Wronged by Cymosco, who in prison mews<BR>
Her plighted spouse, that ere he makes repair<BR>
Further, he gives her hope to venge the abuse:<BR>
He does so, and departs; and with his spouse<BR>
Departs Bireno, to repeat his vows.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
W<SMALL>HAT</SMALL> cannot, when he has a heart possess&#8217;d<BR>
This false and cruel traitor Love? since he<BR>
Can banish from Orlando&#8217;s faithful breast<BR>
Such tried allegiance and due loyalty?<BR>
Wise, full of all regards, and of the blest<BR>
And glorious church the champion wont to be,<BR>
Now, little for himself or uncle, driven<BR>
By a vain love, he cares, and less for heaven.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
But I excuse him well, rejoiced to know<BR>
I have like partner in my vice: for still<BR>
To seek my good I too am faint and slow,<BR>
But sound and nimble in pursuit of ill.<BR>
The count departs, disguised in sable show,<BR>
Nor for so many friends, with froward will,<BR>
Deserted cares; and comes where on the plain<BR>
Are camped the hosts of Afric and of Spain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Rather uncamped: for, in less troops or more,<BR>
Rains under shed and tree had driven the band.<BR>
Here ten, there twenty, seven or eight, or four,<BR>
Near or further off, Orlando scanned.<BR>
Each sleeps, oppressed with toil and wearied sore;<BR>
This stretched on earth, that propped upon his hand:<BR>
They sleep, and many might the count have slain,<BR>
Yet never bared his puissant Durindane.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
So generous is Orlando&#8217;s heart, he base<BR>
Esteems it were to smite a sleeping foe.<BR>
Now this he seeks, and now that other place;<BR>
Yet cannot track his lady, high or low.<BR>
If he finds any one in waking case,<BR>
Sighing, to him he paints her form and show;<BR>
Then prays him that for courtesy, he where<BR>
The damsel is, will reach him to repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
And when the day its shining light displayed,<BR>
He wholly searched the Moorish army through.<BR>
In that the gentle warrior was arrayed<BR>
In Arab weeds, he this might safely do;<BR>
And of his purpose came alike in aid<BR>
That other tongues beside the French he knew;<BR>
And in the African so well was read,<BR>
He seemed in Tripoly one born and bred:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
He sojourns there three days, the camp to see;<BR>
Still seeking nought beside: next up and down,<BR>
Within, without, both burgh and city he<BR>
Spies; nor surveys the realm of France alone;<BR>
But fair Auvergne, and even Gascony<BR>
Revisits, to its farthest little town.<BR>
Roves from Provence to Brittany&#8217;s domain,<BR>
And from the Picards to the bounds of Spain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Between October and November&#8217;s moon,<BR>
In that dull season when the leafy vest<BR>
Is stript from trembling plant, whose limbs are shown<BR>
Of all their mantling foliage dispossess&#8217;d<BR>
And in close flights the swarming birds are flown,<BR>
Orlando enters on his amorous quest:<BR>
This he pursues the livelong winter through,<BR>
Nor quits when gladsome spring returns anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
As (such his wont) from land to land he goes,<BR>
A river&#8217;s side he reaches on a day;<BR>
Which to the neighbouring sea in quiet flows,<BR>
Bretons and Normans parting on its way:<BR>
But, swoln with mountain rain and melted snows,<BR>
Then thundered, white with foam and flashing-spray:<BR>
And with impetuous stream had overtopt<BR>
Its brim, and burst the bridge, and passage stopt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
The paladin this bank and the other eyed,<BR>
Along the river&#8217;s channel, to explore,<BR>
Since neither fish nor fowl, if from his side<BR>
He could gain footing on the adverse shore;<BR>
When, with a damsel in the poop, he spied<BR>
A ready pinnace that towards him bore:<BR>
She steered, as if she would approach the strand;<BR>
But would not let her shallop make the land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Steered not to land; as haply with suspicion<BR>
To take a lading, in her own despite.<BR>
To her the good Orlando made petition<BR>
To put him o&#8217;er the stream; and she: &#8220;No knight<BR>
Passes this ferry, but upon condition<BR>
He shall his faith and promise duly plight,<BR>
That he will do a battle, at my prayer,<BR>
Upon the justest quarrel and most fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So that if thou on that other shore to land<BR>
Dost by my aid, Sir cavalier, desire,<BR>
Promise me, ere the month which is at hand&#8221;<BR>
(The damsel so pursued her speech) &#8220;expire,<BR>
That thou wilt join the Hibernian monarch&#8217;s hand,<BR>
Who forms a fair armada, in his ire,<BR>
To sack Ebuda&#8217;s isle; of all compress&#8217;d<BR>
By ocean&#8217;s circling waves, the cruellest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Know, beyond Ireland, in the briny flood,<BR>
An island, amid many others, lies;<BR>
Ebuda is its name; whose people rude<BR>
(Such is their law), in search of plunder hies;<BR>
And all the women that it takes, for food<BR>
To a voracious animal supplies;<BR>
Which every day to shore for this does speed,<BR>
And finds new wife or maid whereon to feed:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For of these merchant still and Corsair sell<BR>
A large supply, and most of those most fair.<BR>
Reckoning one slain a-day, you thus may well<BR>
Compute what wives and maids have perished there.<BR>
But if compassion in your bosom dwell,<BR>
Nor you to Love an utter rebel are,<BR>
Be you contented with this band to wend,<BR>
United for such profitable end.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
To hear the whole Orlando scarce could bear,<BR>
Ere to be first in that emprize he swore,<BR>
As one who evil deed misliked to hear,<BR>
And with impatience like relation bore:<BR>
Hence first induced to think, and next to fear,<BR>
Angelica is captive on that shore:<BR>
Since he so long the missing maid pursues,<BR>
Nor of the damsel yet can gather news.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Breaking his every scheme, this phantasy<BR>
The troubled cavalier did so confound,<BR>
That will all speed to that fell island he<BR>
Resolved to navigate; nor yet the round<BR>
Of a new sun was buried in the sea,<BR>
Ere he a vessel at St. Malo&#8217;s found;<BR>
In which, embarking on his quest, the count<BR>
Put forth, and cleared that night St. Michael&#8217;s Mount.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Breac and Landriglier past on the left hand,<BR>
Orlando&#8217;s vessel skims the Breton shore;<BR>
Then shapes her course towards the chalky strand,<BR>
Whence England&#8217;s isle the name of Albion bore:<BR>
But the south wind, which had her canvas fanned,<BR>
Shifts to north-west, and freshening, blows so sore,<BR>
The mariners are fain to strike all sail,<BR>
And wear and scud before the boisterous gale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
A distance traversed in four days, in one<BR>
Backwards the ceaseless wind the frigate bore;<BR>
The helmsman kept the sea, lest she should run<BR>
Aground, and break like glass upon the shore.<BR>
The wind upon the fifth day changed its tune,<BR>
So loud and furious through the other four;<BR>
And let, without more strife, the vessel gain<BR>
A port, where Antwerp&#8217;s river met the main.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
As soon as harboured there in shattered plight,<BR>
The weary mariners their frigate moor,<BR>
Out of a city, seated on the right<BR>
Of that fair stream, descends upon the shore,<BR>
As his gray hairs may warrant him, a wight<BR>
Stricken in years; who, full of courteous lore,<BR>
Turns to the county, after greetings due,<BR>
Reputing him the leader of that crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
And prays him, on a damsel&#8217;s part, &#8216;that he<BR>
To her would think not irksome to repair;<BR>
Whom of unequalled affability<BR>
And sweetness, he would find, as well as fair;<BR>
Or otherwise would be content, that she<BR>
Should to his bark resort, to seek him there,<BR>
Nor prove less pliant than had been before<BR>
All the knights errant, who had sought that shore:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8216;For hitherto, by land or sea conveyed,<BR>
No cavalier had journeyed to that place<BR>
That had refused to parlay with the maid,<BR>
And give her counsel in a cruel case.&#8217;<BR>
Orlando, hearing this, no more delayed,<BR>
But issued from the bark with hurried pace,<BR>
And, in all kind and courteous usage bred,<BR>
His way directed where the ancient led.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
With him did Roland to the city go,<BR>
And at the bottom of a palace-stair,<BR>
Conducted by that elder, full of woe<BR>
A lady found, if face may grief declare,<BR>
And sable cloth, with which (a mournful show)<BR>
Chamber, and hall, and gallery, furnished were;<BR>
Who, after honourable welcome paid,<BR>
Seated the paladin, and sadly said:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The daughter of the Count of Holland,&#8221; (cried<BR>
The lady) &#8220;know in me, Sir cavalier.<BR>
Though not his only offspring (for beside<BR>
Myself two brothers were) to him so dear,<BR>
That, for whatever favour I applied,<BR>
I never met refusal from the peer.<BR>
I living glady in this happy sort,<BR>
A duke by chance was guested at our court;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The Duke of Zealand, meaning for Biscay;<BR>
With purpose there to war upon the Moor;<BR>
His youth and beauty, then in manhood&#8217;s May,<BR>
And force of love, unfelt by me before,<BR>
Made me, with little strife, his easy prey:<BR>
Persuaded by his outward cheer yet more,<BR>
I thought, and think, and still shall think, the peer<BR>
Loved me, and loves me yet with heart sincere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Those days, whenas the wind was contrary,<BR>
(Which fair for me, if foul for others blew)<BR>
To others forty seemed, an hour to me;<BR>
So upon speedy wings the moments flew.<BR>
This while, we oftentimes held colloquy,<BR>
When, to be given with solemn right and due,<BR>
I promised him, and he to me, his hand,<BR>
On his return, in wedlock&#8217;s holy band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Bireno hardly from our court was gone,<BR>
For such the name my faithful lover bore,<BR>
When Friesland&#8217;s king, whose realm is from our own<BR>
No further than this stream from Ocean&#8217;s shore,<BR>
Designing to bestow me on his son,<BR>
Arbantes hight (the monarch had no more),<BR>
To Holland sent the worthiest of his land,<BR>
Me of the count, my father, to demand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I without power to falsify that vow,<BR>
Which to my gentle lover I had plight;<BR>
Nor though I had the power, would Love allow<BR>
Me so to play the ingrate, if I might,<BR>
(The treaty, well on foot, to overthrow,<BR>
And nigh concluded) with afflicted sprite,<BR>
Cried <I>to my father, I would rather shed<BR>
My very life-blood, than in Friesland wed</I>.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My gracious father, he who took but pleasure<BR>
In what pleased me, nor would my will constrain;<BR>
Marking my grief, broke off the intended measure,<BR>
To give me comfort and relieve my pain.<BR>
At this proud Friesland&#8217;s sovereign such displeasure<BR>
Conceived, and entertained such high disdain,<BR>
He entered Holland, and the war began,<BR>
In which my kin were slaughtered to a man.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Besides, that both his puissance and his might<BR>
Are such, as in our age are matched of few,<BR>
Such is in evil deeds his cunning sleight,<BR>
He laughs to scorn what wit and force can do.<BR>
Strange arms he bears, unknown to any wight,<BR>
Save him, of the ancient nations or the new:<BR>
A hollow iron, two yards long, whose small<BR>
Channel he loads with powder and a ball</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, where &#8217;tis closed behind, in the iron round,<BR>
Touches with fire a vent, discerned with pain;<BR>
In guise that skilful surgeon tries his ground,<BR>
Where need requires that he should breathe a vein.<BR>
Whence flies the bullet with such deafening sound,<BR>
That bolt and lightening from the hollow cane<BR>
Appear to dart, and like the passing thunder,<BR>
Burn what they smite, beat-down or rend asunder.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Twice broken, he our armies overthrew<BR>
With this device, my gentle brethren slain;<BR>
The first the shot in our first battle slew,<BR>
Reaching his heart, through broken plate and chain;<BR>
The other in the other onset, who<BR>
Was flying from the fatal field in vain.<BR>
The ball his shoulder from a distance tore<BR>
Behind, and issued from his breast before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My father next, defending on a day<BR>
The only fortress which he still possessed,<BR>
The others taken which about it lay,<BR>
Was sent alike to his eternal rest:<BR>
Who going and returning, to purvey<BR>
What lacked, as this or that occasion pressed,<BR>
Was aimed at from afar, in privy wise,<BR>
And by the traytour struck between the eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And I remaining, sire and brethren dead,<BR>
The isle of Holland&#8217;s only heir, the king<BR>
Of Friesland, who by the desire was led<BR>
Of better there his power establishing,<BR>
To me, and also to my people said,<BR>
I peace and quiet to my state might bring,<BR>
Would I (when I before would not accord)<BR>
Now take his son Arbantes for my lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I, not so much for deadly hate I bear<BR>
To him and all his kindred, by whose spite<BR>
My sire and both my brothers slaughtered were,<BR>
My country sacked and waste, as that the knight<BR>
I would not wrong, to whom I fealty sware,<BR>
And had my solemn word already plight<BR>
That me to wedlock man should woo in vain,<BR>
Till he to Holland should return from Spain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For one ill-born, a hundred yet behind,<BR>
Will bear (replied) to hazard all content,<BR>
&#8212;Slain, burnt alive, to let them to the wind<BR>
Scatter my ashes, rather than consent.&#8212;<BR>
My people seek to move my stedfast mind,<BR>
By prayer and by protest, from this intent;<BR>
And threat to yield my city up and me,<BR>
Lest all be lost through my obduracy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When in my fixt and firm resolve they read,<BR>
That prayer and protest are alike in vain;<BR>
My town and me, with Friesland&#8217;s king agreed,<BR>
Surrendered, as they vowed, my vassal train.<BR>
Not doing by me any shameful deed,<BR>
Me he assured of life and of domain,<BR>
So I would soften my obdurate mood,<BR>
And be to wed with his Arbantes wooed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I who would have consented to forego<BR>
My life to scape from him, reflection made,<BR>
That, save I first avenged myself, all woe<BR>
Endured, would be by this regret outweighed.<BR>
&#8212;Long time I muse, and to my misery know,<BR>
&#8217;Tis only simulation which can aid.<BR>
Not simple willingness, I feign desire,<BR>
To win his grace, and have him for my sire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Mid many in my father&#8217;s service, I<BR>
Select two brothers fitted for my view,<BR>
Of valiant heart and great ability<BR>
But more approved for truth, as followers, who<BR>
Bred in my father&#8217;s court, from infancy<BR>
Had with myself grown up; the brothers two<BR>
So wholly bound to me, they would have thought<BR>
My safety with their lives was cheaply bought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To them I tell my project, and the pair<BR>
Of brethren promise me their faithful aid:<BR>
To Flanders this, a pinnace to prepare,<BR>
I sent, and that with me in Holland stayed.<BR>
Now, while both foreigners and natives were,<BR>
Of Friesland&#8217;s kingdom, to our nuptials prayed,<BR>
Bireno in Biscay (the tidings went)<BR>
For Holland had equipt an armament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Since on the issue of the earliest fray,<BR>
When in the rout one hapless brother fell,<BR>
I had dispatched a courier to Biscay,<BR>
Who the sad news should to Bireno tell:<BR>
While he toils sore his squadron to array,<BR>
Proud Friesland&#8217;s arms our wretched remnant quell.<BR>
Bireno, who knew nought of this, had weighed,<BR>
And with his barks put forth to bring us aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;These tidings told to Friesland&#8217;s monarch, he<BR>
Confiding to his son the wedding&#8217;s care,<BR>
To meet Bireno&#8217;s squadron puts to sea,<BR>
And (so chance willed) burns, sinks, or routs them there,<BR>
Leading him off into captivity;&#8212;<BR>
But none to us as yet the tidings bear.<BR>
This while I to the amorous youth am wed,<BR>
Who, when the sun sought <I>his</I>, would seek <I>my</I> bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Behind the curtains, I had hid the tried<BR>
And faithful follower, of whom I said,<BR>
Who moved not till the bridegroom he descried,<BR>
Yet waited not till he in bed was laid:<BR>
But raised a hatchet, and so well applied<BR>
Behind the stripling&#8217;s head the ponderous blade,<BR>
Of speech and life it reft him; I, who note<BR>
The deed, leap lightly up and cut his throat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As falls the bullock upon shamble-sill,<BR>
Thus fell the ill-starred stripling, in despite<BR>
Of king Cymosco, worst among the ill;<BR>
So was the impious king of Friesland hight<BR>
Who did my brothers and my father kill,<BR>
And, in my state to found a better right;<BR>
In wedlock wished to join me with his son,<BR>
Haply to slay me when his end was won.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ere new disturbance interrupt the deed,<BR>
Taking what costliest was and lightest weighed,<BR>
Me my companion by a chord, with speed,<BR>
Drops from a window, where with boat purveyed<BR>
In Flanders (as related) for my need,<BR>
His brother, watchful of our motions, stayed:<BR>
We dip the oar, we loose the sail, and driven<BR>
By both, escape, as was the will of Heaven.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The daring feat achieved, I cannot say<BR>
If Friesland&#8217;s king more sorrowed for his son,<BR>
Or raged at me: he there arrived, the day<BR>
Ensuing, where the dreadful deed was done,<BR>
Proud he returned, both he and his array,<BR>
Of the duke taken, and the victory won:<BR>
And thought to feast and nuptials he was bound,<BR>
But in his home all grief and darkness found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His pity for his son, the hate he fed<BR>
Towards me, torment the father day and night;<BR>
But as lamenting will not raise the dead,<BR>
And vengeance is a vent for smothered spite;<BR>
That portion of his thoughts, which should have led<BR>
The king, to ease by sighs his troubled sprite,<BR>
Now willingly takes counsel with his hate,<BR>
To seize me, and his vengeance satiate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;All known or said to by my friends, or who<BR>
Were friends of those that, chosen from my train,<BR>
Had aided me the deadly deed to do,<BR>
Their goods and chattels burnt, were doomed or slain:<BR>
And he had killed Bireno, since he knew<BR>
No other trouble could inflict such pain;<BR>
But that he, saving him in malice, thought<BR>
He had a net wherewith I might be caught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet him a cruel proposition made,<BR>
Granting a year his purpose to complete;<BR>
Condemned to privy death, till then delayed,<BR>
Save in that time, through force or through deceit,<BR>
He by his friends&#8217; and kindred&#8217;s utmost aid,<BR>
Doing or plotting, me from my retreat<BR>
Conveyed into his prisons; so that he<BR>
Can only saved by my destruction be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What for his safety could be done, behold,<BR>
Short of my own destruction, had been tried.<BR>
Six towns I had in Flanders: these I sold,<BR>
And (great or small the produce set aside)<BR>
A part of it, to wily persons told,<BR>
That it to tempt his guards might be applied;<BR>
The rest of it dispensed to move and arm<BR>
Germans or English, to the miscreant&#8217;s harm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My agents, whether they their trust betrayed,<BR>
Or that they could in truth perform no more,<BR>
Me with vain words instead of help have paid,<BR>
And scorn me, having drained my scanty store:<BR>
And now the term is nigh expired, when aid,<BR>
Whether of open force or treasured ore,<BR>
No longer will arrive in time to save<BR>
My cherished spouse from torture and the grave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Through him, from me was my dominion rent;<BR>
Through him, my father and my brethren slain;<BR>
Through him, the little treasure left me, spent<BR>
(What served alone existence to sustain)<BR>
To rescue him, in cruel durance pent;<BR>
Nor other means to succour him remain;<BR>
Save I, to liberate him from prison, go<BR>
And yield myself to such a cruel foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If nothing more be left me then to try,<BR>
Nor other way for his escape appear,<BR>
Than <I>his</I> with this <I>my</I> wretched life to buy,<BR>
This life I gladly will lay down: one fear<BR>
Alone molests me; and it is that I<BR>
Can never my conditions make so clear,<BR>
As to assure me, that with new deceit,<BR>
Me, when his prey, the tyrant will not cheat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I fear, when I shall be in captive plight,<BR>
And he has put all tortures upon me,<BR>
He may not loose Bireno, and the knight<BR>
Have not to thank me for his liberty:<BR>
Like perjured king, and full of foul despite,<BR>
Who with my murder will not satiate be;<BR>
But by Bireno neither less nor more<BR>
Will do, than he had done by me before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The occasion now that I confer with you,<BR>
And tell my case to all who seek the land,<BR>
Both lords and knights, is with the single view,<BR>
That taking counsel of so large a band,<BR>
Some one may indicate assurance due,<BR>
That when before the cruel king I stand,<BR>
No longer he Bireno shall detain;<BR>
Nor, after I am killed, the duke be slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Warrior to wend with me, I in my need,<BR>
When I shall be to Friesland given, have prayed;<BR>
But so he promise, that the exchange agreed<BR>
Shall be between us in such manner made,<BR>
That from his bonds Bireno shall be freed<BR>
When I am to the monarch&#8217;s hands conveyed:<BR>
Thus I, when I am slain, shall die content,<BR>
Who to my spouse shall life by death have lent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not to this day have chanced upon a wight<BR>
Who on his faith will give me warranty,<BR>
That if the king refuse to loose the knight,<BR>
When I am offered, from captivity,<BR>
He will not suffer that in my despite<BR>
(So feared those weapons!) I shall taken be.<BR>
So feared those weapons, upon every hand!<BR>
Which, howsoever thick, no plates withstand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Now, if as strong Herculean port and bold<BR>
Appear to vouch, such worth to you belong;<BR>
And you believe to give me or withhold<BR>
Is in your power, should he intend me wrong;<BR>
Be with me, when committed to his hold,<BR>
Since I shall fear not, in your convoy strong,<BR>
When you are with me, that my lord, though I<BR>
Be after slain, shall by his order die.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Here her discourse, wherewith were interposed<BR>
Loud sobs, the lady ceased, and silent stood:<BR>
Orlando, when her lips the damsel closed,<BR>
Whose ready will ne&#8217;er halts in doing good,<BR>
Briefly to her replies, as indisposed<BR>
To idle speeches of his natural mood:<BR>
But plights his solemn word, that better aid<BR>
She should from him receive than that she prayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis not his scheme to place her in the hand<BR>
Of her foul foe, to have Bireno freed;<BR>
He will save both the lovers, if his brand<BR>
And wonted valour fail him not at need.<BR>
Embarked that very day, they put from land<BR>
With a clear sky and prosperous wind to speed.<BR>
The county hastes in his impatient heat,<BR>
Eager to reach that isle, the monster&#8217;s seat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
Through the still deeps, on this or the other side,<BR>
The skipper veered his canvas to the wind:<BR>
This isle, and that of Zealand, they descried,<BR>
One seen before, and one shut in behind.<BR>
The third day, from the harboured vessel&#8217;s side,<BR>
In Holland, Roland disembarks, not joined<BR>
By the complaining dame; whom to descend<BR>
He will not till she hear that tyrant&#8217;s end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Armed at all points, the county passed ashore,<BR>
Borne on a horse &#8217;twixt brown and black, the breed<BR>
Of Denmark, but in Flanders nurtured, more<BR>
Esteemed for weight and puissance than for speed:<BR>
For when the paladin embarked before,<BR>
In Brittany he left the gallant steed,<BR>
His Brigliador; so nimble and so fair,<BR>
That but Bayardo could with him compare.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Orlando fares to Dordrecht, where he views<BR>
A numerous squadron, which the gate maintain;<BR>
As well, because suspicion still ensues<BR>
On the foundation of a new domain;<BR>
As that before they had received the news,<BR>
That out of Zealand, backed with armed train,<BR>
Was coming with a fleet of many sail,<BR>
A cousin of the lord here pent in jail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
One, good Orlando to the monarch&#8217;s ear<BR>
Bade bear a message, &#8216;that an errant knight<BR>
Oh him would prove himself, with sword and spear;<BR>
But would lay down this pact before the fight:&#8212;<BR>
That if the king unhorsed the cavalier,<BR>
Her who Arbantes slew, he, as his right,<BR>
Should have, that, at the cavalier&#8217;s command,<BR>
Was ready for delivery to his hand;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8216;And willed the king should on his side agree,<BR>
If him the knight in combat overbore,<BR>
Forthwith released from his captivity,<BR>
Bireno to full freedom to restore.&#8217;<BR>
To him the footman does his embassy;<BR>
But he, who knightly worth or courteous lore<BR>
Had never known, directs his whole intent<BR>
The count by treacherous fraud to circumvent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
He hopes as well, if he the warrior slay,<BR>
To have the dame, whom, so aggrieved, he hates,<BR>
If in the knight&#8217;s disposal, and the say<BR>
Of that strange knight, the footman well relates.<BR>
Hence thirty men dispatched by other way<BR>
Than to the portal led, where Roland waits;<BR>
Who with a long and privy circuit wind,<BR>
And come upon the paladin behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
He all this while had made his guard delay<BR>
The knight with words, till horse and foot he spied<BR>
Arrived, where he this ambuscade did lay;<BR>
When from the gate he with as many hied:<BR>
As is the practised hunter&#8217;s wonted way,<BR>
To circle wood and beasts on every side:<BR>
As nigh Volana, with his sweeping nets,<BR>
The wary fisher fish and pool besets.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis thus the king bars every path which lies<BR>
Free for the warrior&#8217;s flight, with armed train:<BR>
He him alive, and in no other guise,<BR>
Would have, and lightly hopes his end to gain;<BR>
Nor for the earthly thunderbolt applies,<BR>
That had so many and so many slain:<BR>
Which here he deems would serve his purpose ill,<BR>
Where he desires to take and not to kill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
As wary fowler, bent on greater prey,<BR>
Wisely preserves alive the game first caught,<BR>
That by the call-bird and his cheating play,<BR>
More may within the circling net be brought;<BR>
Such cunning art Cymosco would assay:<BR>
But Roland would not be so lightly bought;<BR>
Like them by the first toil that springs betrayed;<BR>
And quickly forced the circle which was made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Where he perceives the assailants thickest stand,<BR>
He rests his lance, and sticks in his career<BR>
First one and afterwards another, and<BR>
Another, and another, who appear<BR>
Of paste; till six he of the circling band<BR>
Of foes impales upon a single spear;<BR>
A seventh left out, who by the push is slain,<BR>
Since the clogged weapon can no more contain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
No otherwise, upon the further shore<BR>
Of fosse or of canal, the frogs we spy,<BR>
By cautious archer, practised in his lore,<BR>
Smote and transfixed the one the other nigh;<BR>
Upon the shaft, until it hold no more,<BR>
From barb to feathers full, allowed to lie.<BR>
The heavy lance Orlando from him flung,<BR>
And to close combat with his faulchion sprung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
The lance now broke, his sword the warrior drew,<BR>
That sword which never yet was drawn in vain,<BR>
And still with cut or thrust some soldier slew;<BR>
Now horse, now footman of the tyrant&#8217;s train.<BR>
And, ever where he dealt a stroke, changed blue,<BR>
Yellow, green, white and black, to crimson stain.<BR>
Cymosco grieves, when most his need require,<BR>
Not to have now his hollow cane and fire;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
And with loud voice and menacing command<BR>
Bids these be brought, but ill his followers hear;<BR>
For those who have found safety of his band,<BR>
To issue from the city are in fear.<BR>
He, when he sees them fly on either hand,<BR>
Would fly as well from that dread cavalier;<BR>
Makes for the gate, and would the drawbridge lift,<BR>
But the pursuing county is too swift.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
The monarch turns his back, and leaves the knight<BR>
Lord of the drawbridge and of either gate.<BR>
Thanks to his swifter steed, the rest in flight<BR>
He passes: good Orlando will not wait<BR>
(Intent the felon, not his band, to smite)<BR>
Upon the vulgar herd to wreck his hate.<BR>
But his slow horse seems restive; while the king&#8217;s,<BR>
More nimble, flies as if equipt with wings.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
From street to street, before the count he made;<BR>
And vanished clean; but after little stay,<BR>
Came with new arms, with tube and fire purveyed;<BR>
Which, at his hest, this while his men convey.<BR>
And posted at a corner, he waylaid:<BR>
His foe, as hunter watches for his prey,<BR>
In forest, with armed dogs and spear, attending<BR>
The boar in fury from the hill descending,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Who rends the branch and overthrows the stone;<BR>
And wheresoe&#8217;er he turns his haughty front,<BR>
Appears (so loud the deafening crash and groan)<BR>
As if he were uprending wood and mount.<BR>
Intent to make him his bold deed atone,<BR>
Cymosco at the pass expects the count;<BR>
As soon as he appears, with ready light<BR>
Touches the hole, and fires upon the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Behind, the weapon flames in lightning&#8217;s guise,<BR>
And vents the thunder from before; the ground<BR>
Shakes under foot and city wall; the skies<BR>
The fearful echo all about rebound.<BR>
The burning bolt with sudden fury flies,<BR>
Not sparing aught which in its course is found.<BR>
Hissing and whizzing through the skies it went;<BR>
But smote not, to the assassin&#8217;s foul intent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Whether it was his great desire to kill<BR>
That baron, or his hurry made him fail,<BR>
Or trembling heart, like leaf which flutters still,<BR>
Made hand and arm together flinch and quail;<BR>
Or that it was not the Creator&#8217;s will<BR>
The church so soon her champion should bewail;<BR>
The glancing stroke his courser&#8217;s belly tore,<BR>
Outstretched on earth, from thence to rise no more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
To earth fall horse and rider: this the knight<BR>
Scarce touched; the other thundering pressed the plain:<BR>
For the first rose so ready and so light,<BR>
He from the fall seemed breath and force to gain.<BR>
As African Ant&euml;us, in the fight,<BR>
Rose from the sand with prouder might and main;<BR>
So when Orlando touched the ground, to view<BR>
He rose with doubled force and vigour new.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
He who has seen the thunder, from on high,<BR>
Discharged by Jove with such a horrid sound,<BR>
Descend where nitre, coal, and sulphur lie,<BR>
Stored up for use in magazine profound,<BR>
Which scarce has reached&#8212;but touched it, ere the sky<BR>
Is in a flame, as well as burning ground,<BR>
Firm walls are split, and solid marbles riven,<BR>
And flying stones cast up as high as heaven;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Let him imagine, when from earth he sprung,<BR>
Such was the semblance of the cavalier;<BR>
Who moved in mode to frighten Mars among<BR>
The Gods, so fierce and horrid was his cheer.<BR>
At this dismay&#8217;d, the King of Friesland stung<BR>
His horse, and turned his rein, to fly the peer:<BR>
But fierce Orlando was upon his foe<BR>
Faster than arrow flies from bended bow:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
And, what before he could not, when possest<BR>
Of his good courser, now afoot will do.<BR>
His speed outgoes all thought in every breast,<BR>
Exceeds all credence, save in those who view.<BR>
The tyrant shortly joined, he on the crest<BR>
Smote at his head so well, he cleft it through;<BR>
And to the neck divided by the blow,<BR>
Sent it, to shake its last on earth below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Lo! in the frighted city other sound<BR>
Was heard to rise, and other crash of brands,<BR>
From troop, who, thither in his guidance bound,<BR>
Followed Bireno&#8217;s cousin from his lands:<BR>
Who, since the unguarded gates he open found,<BR>
Into the city&#8217;s heart had poured his bands;<BR>
Where the bold paladin had struck such fear,<BR>
He without let might scour it far and near.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
In rout the people fly, who cannot guess<BR>
Who these may be, or what the foes demand:<BR>
But, when this man and that by speech and dress<BR>
As Zealand-men distinguishes the band,<BR>
<I>Carte blanche</I> they proffer, and the chief address,<BR>
Bidding him range them under his command;<BR>
Against the Frieslanders to lend him aid,<BR>
Who have their duke in loathsome prison stayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
To Friesland&#8217;s king that people hatred bore<BR>
With all his following; who their ancient lord<BR>
Had put to death, and who by them yet more,<BR>
As evil and rapacious, was abhorred.<BR>
Orlando interposed with kindly lore,<BR>
As friend of both, the parties to accord:<BR>
By whom, so joined, no Frieslander was left<BR>
But was of life or liberty bereft.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
They would not wait to seek the dungeon-key,<BR>
But breaking-down the gate, their entrance made:<BR>
Bireno to the count with courtesy<BR>
And grateful thanks the service done repaid.<BR>
Thence they, together with large company,<BR>
Went where Olympia in her vessel stayed:<BR>
For so was the expecting lady hight,<BR>
To whom that island&#8217;s crown belonged of right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
She who had thither good Orlando brought,<BR>
Not hoping that he would have thriven so well;<BR>
&#8212;Enough for her, if by her misery bought,<BR>
Her spouse were rescued from the tyrant&#8217;s cell!&#8212;<BR>
Her, full of love and loyal homage, sought<BR>
The people one and all: &#8217;Twere long to tell<BR>
How she caressed Bireno, he the maid,&#8212;<BR>
What thanks both lovers to the county paid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
The people, throned in her paternal reign,<BR>
Replace the injured dame, and fealty swear:<BR>
She on the duke, to whom in solid chain<BR>
Love with eternal knot had linked the fair,<BR>
The empire of herself and her domain<BR>
Conferred: He, called away by other care,<BR>
Left in the cousin&#8217;s guardian care this while<BR>
His fortresses, and all the subject isle.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Since he to visit Zealand&#8217;s duchy planned,<BR>
His faithful consort in his company;<BR>
And thence, upon the king of Friesland&#8217;s land,<BR>
Would try his fortune (as he said), for he<BR>
A pledge, he rated highly, had in hand,<BR>
Which seemed of fair success the warranty,<BR>
The daughter of the king; who here forsaken,<BR>
With many others had been prisoner taken.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
To a younger brother, her, the duke pretends,<BR>
To be conjoined in wedlock, he conveyed.<BR>
The Roman senator thence parting wends<BR>
Upon the very day Bireno weighed;<BR>
But he to nothing else his hand extends<BR>
Of all the many, many prizes made,<BR>
Save to that engine, found amid the plunder,<BR>
Which in all points I said resembled thunder.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Not with intent, in his defence to bear<BR>
What he had taken, of the prize possest;<BR>
For he still held it an ungenerous care<BR>
To go with vantage on whatever quest:<BR>
But with design to cast the weapon where<BR>
It never more should living wight molest;<BR>
And, what was appertaining to it, all<BR>
Bore off as well, the powder and the ball.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
And thus, when of the tidesway he was clear,<BR>
And in the deepest sea his bark descried,<BR>
So that no longer distant signs appear<BR>
Of either shore on this or the other side,<BR>
He seized the tube, and said: &#8220;That cavalier<BR>
May never vail through thee his knightly pride,<BR>
Nor base be rated with a better foe,<BR>
Down with thee to the darkest deep below!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O loathed, O cursed piece of enginery,<BR>
Cast in Tartarean bottom, by the hand<BR>
Of Beelzebub, whose foul malignity<BR>
The ruin of this world through thee has planned!<BR>
To hell, from whence thou came, I render thee.&#8221;<BR>
So said, he cast away the weapon; fanned<BR>
Meanwhile, with flowing sheet, his frigate goes,<BR>
By wind, which for the cruel island blows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
Such was the paladin&#8217;s desire to explore<BR>
If in the place his missing lady were;<BR>
Whom he prefers the united world before,<BR>
Nor can an hour of life without her bear.<BR>
He fears, if he set foot on Ireland&#8217;s shore,<BR>
Some other chance may interrupt him there:<BR>
So that he after have in vain to say,<BR>
&#8220;Why hasted I no faster on my way?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Nor he in England nor in Ireland port<BR>
Will make, nor on the coast that&#8217;s opposite.<BR>
But let him go, the naked archer&#8217;s sport,<BR>
Sore smitten in the heart!&#8212;ere I indite<BR>
Yet more of him, to Holland I resort,<BR>
And you to hear me company invite.<BR>
For well I wot that you as well as me<BR>
&#8217;Twould grieve <I>that</I> bridal should without us be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Sumptuous and fair the bridal there is made;<BR>
But neither yet so sumptuous nor so fair<BR>
As it will be in Zealand, it is said:<BR>
But &#8217;tis not my design you should repair<BR>
Thither; since by new accidents delayed<BR>
The feast will be, of which be it my care,<BR>
In other strain, the tidings to report;<BR>
If you to hear that other strain resort.</TD></TR>
