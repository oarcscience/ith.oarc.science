<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Of mighty matters, sculptured in a font,<BR>
Does Malagigi to his comrades tell:<BR>
On them come Mandricardo and Rodomont,<BR>
And forthwith battle follows fierce and fell.<BR>
Discord goes scattering quarrel and affront<BR>
Amid the crew: but whither, forced by spell,<BR>
Fair Doralice upon her palfrey speeds,<BR>
The Tartar king, and Sarzan, turn their steeds.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
In former ages courteous ladies were,<BR>
Who worshipt virtue, and not worldly gear.<BR>
Women in this degenerate age are rare,<BR>
To whom aught else but sordid gain is dear;<BR>
But they who real goodness make their care,<BR>
Nor with the avaricious many steer,<BR>
In this frail life are worthy to be blest,<BR>
&#8212;Held glorious and immortal when at rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Bradamant well would deathless praise inherit,<BR>
Who nor in wealth nor empire took delight;<BR>
But in Rogero&#8217;s worth, excelling spirit,<BR>
In his unbounded gentlesse; and aright<BR>
For this did good Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter merit<BR>
To be beloved of such a valorous knight;<BR>
Who, what might be for miracles received,<BR>
In future ages, for her sake achieved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
He, with those two of Clermont, as whilere<BR>
To you I in the former canto said,<BR>
I say with Richardet and Aldigier,<BR>
Was gone, to give the prisoned brethren aid:<BR>
I told, as well how they a cavalier<BR>
Of haughty look approaching had surveyed,<BR>
Who bore that noble bird, by fiery birth<BR>
Renewed, and ever single upon earth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
When those three of that warrior were espied,<BR>
Poised on the wing, as if about to smite,<BR>
He fain by proof their prowess would have tried,<BR>
And if their semblance tallied with their might.<BR>
&#8220;Is there, among you, one,&#8221; the stranger cried,<BR>
&#8220;Will prove upon me, which is best in fight,<BR>
With lance or sword, till one to ground be cast,<BR>
While in the sell his foe is seated fast?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8212;I, at your choice,&#8221; said Aldigier, &#8220;were fain<BR>
To flourish faulchion, or to tilt with spear;<BR>
But this with feat, which, if you here remain,<BR>
Yourself may witness, so would interfere,<BR>
That for the present parley time with pain<BR>
Suffices, and yet less for the career.<BR>
Six hundred men, or more, we here attend,<BR>
With whom we must to-day in arms contend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Two of our own to rescue from their foes,<BR>
And free from chains, us Love and Pity sway.&#8221;<BR>
He to that stranger next the reason shows<BR>
Why thus in steel their bodies they array.<BR>
&#8220;So just is the excuse which you oppose,&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;He answered&#8212;&#8220;that I ill should this gainsay,<BR>
And hold you surely for three cavaliers<BR>
That seldom upon earth will find their peers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With you a lance or two I would have crost<BR>
To prove how great your prowess in the field;<BR>
But, since &#8217;tis shown me at another&#8217;s cost,<BR>
Forego the joust, and to your reasons yield.<BR>
Warmly I pray your leave against that host,<BR>
To join with your good arms this helm and shield;<BR>
And hope, if suffered of your band to be,<BR>
No worthless comrade shall you find in me.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Some one, meseems, may crave the stranger&#8217;s name,<BR>
Who thus the champions on their road delayed,<BR>
And so to partnership in arms laid claim<BR>
With those three warriors, for the strife arrayed:<BR>
SHE&#8212;style no more a man that martial dame&#8212;<BR>
Marphisa was; that on Zerbino laid<BR>
The task to bear about, against his will,<BR>
Ribald Gabrina, prone to every ill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
The two of Clermont and their bold compeer<BR>
Gladly received her succour in their cause,<BR>
Whom certes they believed a cavalier,<BR>
And not a damsel, and not what she was.<BR>
A banner was espied by Aldigier<BR>
And shown the others, after little pause,<BR>
Which by the wavering wind was blown about,<BR>
And round about it ranged a numerous rout.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
And when, now nearer, the advancing crew<BR>
Were better marked in Moorish habit stoled,<BR>
For Saracens the stranger band they knew;<BR>
And they upon two sorry jades behold,<BR>
I&#8217; the middle of that troop, the prisoners, who<BR>
Were to the false Maganza to be sold.<BR>
Marphisa cries, &#8220;Why is the feast delayed,<BR>
When lo! the guests are here, for whom we stayed?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;Not all,&#8221; Rogero said, &#8220;Of the array<BR>
Invited, lacks as yet a numerous part:<BR>
A solemn festival is held to-day,<BR>
And we. to grace it more, use every art:<BR>
Yet they can now but little more delay.&#8221;<BR>
While thus they parley, they from other part<BR>
Descry the treacherous Maganzese advance;<BR>
So all was ready to begin the dance.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
They of Maganza from one quarter steer,<BR>
And laden mules beneath their convoy go,<BR>
Bearing vest, gold, and other costly gear.<BR>
On the other side, mid faulchion, spear, and bow,<BR>
Approached the captive two with doleful cheer,<BR>
Who found themselves awaited by the foe;<BR>
And false and impious Bertolagi heard,<BR>
As with the Moorish captain he conferred.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Nor Buovo&#8217;s nor Duke Aymon&#8217;s valiant son<BR>
Can hold, when that false Maganzese they view;<BR>
Against him both with rested lances run:<BR>
He falls the victim of those furious two,<BR>
Through belly and through pummel pierced by one,<BR>
And by the other, in mid visage, through<BR>
His bleeding cheeks: may like disastrous fate<BR>
O&#8217;erwhelm all evil doers, soon or late!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Marphisa with Rogero moved her horse<BR>
At this, nor waited other trumpet-strain;<BR>
Nor broke her lance in her impetuous course,<BR>
Till in succession three had prest the plain.<BR>
A mark well worthy fierce Rogero&#8217;s force,<BR>
The paynim leader in a thought is slain;<BR>
And with him, pierced by the same weapon, go<BR>
Two others to the gloomy realms below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas hence a foul mistake the assaulted made;<BR>
It caused their utter loss, and ruined all:<BR>
They of Maganza deemed themselves betrayed<BR>
By the infidels, upon their leader&#8217;s fall:<BR>
On the other side, so charged with hostile blade,<BR>
The Moors those Maganzese assassins call;<BR>
And, with fierce slaughter, either angry horde<BR>
&#8217;Gan bend bow, and brandish lance and sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Rogero, charging this, or the other band,<BR>
Slays ten or twenty, shifting his career;<BR>
No fewer by the warlike damsel&#8217;s hand<BR>
Are slaughtered and extinguished, there and here:<BR>
As many men as feel the murderous brand<BR>
Are from the saddle seen to disappear:<BR>
Before it vanish cuirass, helms and shields,<BR>
As the dry wood to fire in forest yields.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
If ever you remember to have viewed,<BR>
Or heard,&#8212;what time the wasps divided are,<BR>
And all the winged college is at feud,<BR>
Mustering their swarms for mischief in mid air,&#8212;<BR>
The greedy swallow swoop amid that brood,<BR>
To mangle and devour, and kill, and tear,<BR>
You must imagine so, on either part<BR>
The bold Rogero and Marphisa dart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Not so Sir Richardet and Aldigier,<BR>
Varied the dance between those squadrons twain;<BR>
For, heedless of the Moors, each cavalier<BR>
Had but an eye to false Maganza&#8217;s train.<BR>
The brother of Rinaldo, Charles&#8217;s peer,<BR>
Much courage added to much might and main;<BR>
And these were now redoubled by the spite,<BR>
Which against false Maganza warmed the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
This cause made him who in his fury shared,<BR>
Good Buovo&#8217;s bastard, seems a lion fell;<BR>
He, without pause, each trusty helmet pared<BR>
With his good blade, or crushed it like the shell<BR>
Of brittle egg: and who would not have dared&#8212;<BR>
Would not have shown a Hector&#8217;s worth as well,<BR>
Having two such companions in the stower,<BR>
Of warlike wights the very choice and flower?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Marphisa, waging all the while the fight,<BR>
On her companions often turned to gaze,<BR>
And as she marked their rivalry in might,<BR>
Admiring, upon all bestowed her praise;<BR>
But when she on Rogero fixed her sight,<BR>
Deemed him unparalleled; and in amaze,<BR>
At times believed that Paladin was Mars,<BR>
Who left his heaven to mix in mortal wars.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
She marvels at the champion&#8217;s horrid blows;<BR>
She marvels how in vain they never fell.<BR>
The iron, smit by Balisarda shows<BR>
Like paper, not like stubborn plate and shell.<BR>
To pieces helm and solid corslet goes,<BR>
And men are severed, even to the sell;<BR>
Whom into equal parts those strokes divide,<BR>
Half dropt on this, and half on the other side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
With the same downright stroke, he overbore<BR>
The horse and rider, bleeding in the dust;<BR>
The heads of others from their shoulders bore,<BR>
And parted from the hips the bleeding bust.<BR>
He often at a blow cleft five and more;<BR>
And&#8212;but I doubt who hears me might distrust<BR>
What of a seeming falsehood bears the impress&#8212;<BR>
I would say more; but I parforce say less.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Good Turpin, he who knows that he tells true,<BR>
And leaves men to believe what they think right,<BR>
Says of Rogero wondrous things, which you<BR>
Hearing related, would as falsehoods slight.<BR>
Thus, with Marphisa matched, that hostile crew<BR>
Appears like ice, and she like burning light.<BR>
Nor her Rogero with less marvel eyes,<BR>
That she had marked his valour with surprise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
As she had Mars in bold Rogero seen,<BR>
Perhaps Bellona he had deemed the maid,<BR>
If for a woman he had known that queen,<BR>
Who seemed the contrary, in arms arrayed;<BR>
And haply emulation had between<BR>
The pair ensued, by whom with cruel blade<BR>
Most deadly signs of prowess should be shown,<BR>
Mid that vile herd, on sinew, flesh and bone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
To rout each hostile squadron, filled with dread,<BR>
Sufficed the soul and valour of the four;<BR>
Nor better arms remained for them who fled<BR>
Than the sharp goads which on their heels they wore.<BR>
Happy was he with courser well bested!<BR>
By trot or amble they set little store;<BR>
And he who had no steed, here learned, dismayed,<BR>
How wretched is the poor foot-soldier&#8217;s trade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
The conqueror&#8217;s prize remained both field and prey;<BR>
Nor was there footman left nor muleteer;<BR>
The Moor took this, Maganza took that way;<BR>
One leaves the prisoners, and one leaves the gear.<BR>
With visage glad, and yet with heart more gay,<BR>
The four united each captive cavalier;<BR>
Nor were less diligent to free from chains<BR>
The prisoned pages, and unload the wains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Besides good quantity of silver fine,<BR>
Wrought into different vessels, with a store<BR>
Of feminine array, of fair design,<BR>
Embroidered round about with choicest lore,<BR>
And suit of Flemish tapestry, framed to line<BR>
Royal apartments, wrought with silk and ore&#8212;<BR>
&#8212;They, &#8217;mid more costly things in plenty spread&#8212;<BR>
Discovered flasks of wine, and meat and bread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
When now the conquering troop their temples bare,<BR>
All see they have received a damsel&#8217;s aid,<BR>
Known by her curling locks of golden hair,<BR>
And delicate and beauteous face displayed:<BR>
Her the knights honoured much, and to declare<BR>
Her name, so well deserving glory, prayed;<BR>
Nor she, that ever was of courteous mood<BR>
Among her friends, their instances withstood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
With viewing her they cannot sate their eyes,<BR>
Who in the battle such had her espied,<BR>
She speaks but with the Child, but him descries;<BR>
None prizes, values none, &#8217;twould seem, beside.<BR>
Meanwhile that ready spread a banquet lies,<BR>
To them is by the servants notified.<BR>
This they had served about a neighbouring fountain,<BR>
Screened from the sun by an o&#8217;ershadowing mountain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
This spring was one of those four fountains rare,<BR>
Of those in France produced by Merlin&#8217;s sleight;<BR>
Encompassed round about with marble fair,<BR>
Shining and polished, and then milk more white.<BR>
There in the stone choice figures chisseled were,<BR>
By that magician&#8217;s godlike labour dight;<BR>
Save voice was wanting, these you might have thought<BR>
Were living and with nerve and spirit fraught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Here, to appearance, from the forest prest<BR>
A cruel Beast and hideous to the eye,<BR>
With teeth of wolf, an ass&#8217;s head and crest,<BR>
A carcass with long famine lean and dry,<BR>
And lion&#8217;s claws; a fox in all the rest:<BR>
Which seemed to ravage France and Italy,<BR>
And Spain and England&#8217;s desolated strands,<BR>
Europe and Asia, and in fine all lands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
The beast the low and those of proudest port<BR>
Had slain or maimed throughout this earthly ball;<BR>
Yea, fiercest seemed on those of noble sort,<BR>
Sovereign and satrap, prince and peer, to fall;<BR>
And made most havoc in the Roman court;<BR>
For it had slaughtered Pope and Cardinal:<BR>
Had filled St. Peter&#8217;s beauteous seat with scathe,<BR>
And brought foul scandal on the HOLY FAITH.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
Whate&#8217;er she touches, wall or rampire steep,<BR>
Goes to the ground&#8217; where&#8217;er the monster wends,<BR>
Each fortress opens; neither castle-keep,<BR>
Nor city from her rage its wealth defends.<BR>
Honours divine as well that Beast would reap,<BR>
It seems (while the besotted rabble bends)<BR>
And claim withal, as to its keeping given,<BR>
The sacred keys which open Hell and Heaven.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Approaching next, is seen a cavalier,<BR>
His temples circled with imperial bay;<BR>
Three youths with him in company appear,<BR>
With golden lilies wrought in their array:<BR>
A lion seems against that monster drear<BR>
To issue, with the same device as they:<BR>
The name of these are on the marble read,<BR>
Some on their skirt, some written overhead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Of those who so against Beast advance,<BR>
One to the hilt has in his life-blood dyed<BR>
His faulchion, Francis styled the first of France;<BR>
With Austrian Maximilian at his side:<BR>
In one, who gores his gullet with the lance,<BR>
The emperor Charles the fifth is signified:<BR>
Henry the eighth of England is he hight,<BR>
Who in the monster&#8217;s breast a dart has pight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
The TENTH, in writing, on his back displayed<BR>
The Lion, who that Beast is seen to hold<BR>
By both his ears, and him so well has bayed,<BR>
That thither troop assistants manifold.<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem the world all fear aside has laid;<BR>
And, in amendment of their errors old,<BR>
Thitherward nobles troop, but these are few;<BR>
And so that hideous Beast those hunters slew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
In wonder stood long time that warlike train,<BR>
Desirous, as the storied work they traced,<BR>
To know by hands of whom that Beast was slain,<BR>
Which had so many smiling lands defaced,<BR>
The names unknown to them, though figured plain<BR>
Upon the marble which that fountain cased:<BR>
They one another prayed, if any guessed<BR>
That story, he would tell it to the rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Vivian on Malagigi turned his eyes,<BR>
Who listening stood this while, yet spake he nought.<BR>
&#8220;With thee,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;to tell the meaning lies,<BR>
Who are they, by whose darts and lances dies<BR>
That shouldst by what I see in this be taught:<BR>
The hideous monster, that to bay is brought?&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;And Malagigi&#8212;&#8220;Hitherto their glory<BR>
No author has consigned to living story.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The chiefs whose names are graved upon the stone,<BR>
Not yet have moved upon this worldly stage;<BR>
But will within seven hundred years be known,<BR>
To the great honour of a future age.<BR>
What time king Arthur filled the British throne,<BR>
This fountain Merlin made, enchanter sage;<BR>
Who things to come upon the marble fair<BR>
Made sculpture by a cunning artist&#8217;s care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This Beast, when weights and measures first were found,<BR>
Came out of nether hell; when on the plain,<BR>
Common before, men fixed the landmark&#8217;s bound,<BR>
And fashioned written pacts with jealous pain;<BR>
Yet walked not every where, at first, her round:<BR>
Unvisited she left yet many a reign:<BR>
Through diverse places in our time she wends;<BR>
But the vile rabble and the crowd offends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;From the beginning even to our day,<BR>
Aye has that monster grown, and aye will grow;<BR>
And till much time be past will grow alway:<BR>
Was never mightier, nor worse cause of woe.<BR>
That Python, oft the theme of ancient lay,<BR>
So passing wonderful and fierce in show,<BR>
Came not by half this loathsome monster nigh,<BR>
In all its foulness and deformity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Dread desolation shall it make; nor place<BR>
Will unpolluted or untainted be;<BR>
And you in the mysterious sculptured trace<BR>
But little of its foul iniquity.<BR>
The world, when weary of imploring grace,<BR>
Those worthy peers (whose names you sculptured see,<BR>
And which shall blazing carbuncle outshine),<BR>
To succour in its utmost need combine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No one shall more that cruel beast molest<BR>
Than Francis, who the realm of France will steer,<BR>
Who justly shall be forward in this quest,<BR>
Whom none shall go beyond, whom few shall peer<BR>
Since he in splendour, as in all the rest,<BR>
Wanting in worth, will many make appear<BR>
Who whilom perfect seemed; so fade and yield<BR>
All lesser glories to the sun revealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In the first year of his successful reign,<BR>
The crown yet ill secure upon his front,<BR>
He threads the Alps, and makes their labour vain,<BR>
Who would against his arms maintain the Mount.<BR>
Impelled by generous and by just disdain,<BR>
The unavenged as yet is that affront,<BR>
Which a French army suffered from their rage,<BR>
Who poured from beast-cote, field, and pasturage:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And thence shall into the rich Lombard plain<BR>
Descend, with all the flower of France, and so<BR>
Shall break the Switzer, that henceforth in vain<BR>
Would he uplift his horn against the foe.<BR>
To the sore scandal of the Church and Spain,<BR>
And to the Florentine&#8217;s much scathe and woe,<BR>
By him that famous castle shall be quelled,<BR>
Which inexpugnable whilere was held.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In quelling it his honoured faulchion, more<BR>
Than other arms, availing shall be found;<BR>
Which first that cruel Beast to death will gore,<BR>
The foul destroyer of each country round:<BR>
Parforce will every standard fly before<BR>
That conquering faulchion, or be cast to ground:<BR>
Nor, stormed by it, will rampart, fosse, or wall,<BR>
Secure the city, they surround, from fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Imbued with every generous quality,<BR>
Which can in great commander be combined,<BR>
&#8212;Prudence like his who won Thrasymenae<BR>
And Trebbia&#8217;s field, with Caesar&#8217;s daring mind,<BR>
And Alexander&#8217;s fortune, him I see;<BR>
Without which all designs are mist and wind;<BR>
Withal, so passing liberal, I in none<BR>
Mark his example or his parragon.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
So Malagigi to his comrades said,<BR>
And moved in them desire some name to hear<BR>
Of others, who had laid that monster dead,<BR>
Which to slay others had been used whilere.<BR>
Among the first Bernardo&#8217;s name was read,<BR>
Much vaunted in the writing of the Seer:<BR>
Who said, &#8220;Through him as known as Bibbiena<BR>
As her own neighbour Florence and Siena.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;More forward in this chase shall no one show<BR>
Than Sigismond, than Lewis, and than John;<BR>
Each to that hideous beast a cruel foe;<BR>
One a Gonzaga, one of Arragon,<BR>
And one a Salviati: with them go<BR>
Francis Gonzaga and Frederick his son:<BR>
Brother and son-in-law, their aid afford;<BR>
One chief Ferrara&#8217;s, one Urbino&#8217;s lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of one of these the son, Sir Guidobald,<BR>
Will not by sire, or other, distanced be:<BR>
With Ottobon de Flisco, Sinibald<BR>
Chases the Beast, both striving equally:<BR>
Lewis de Gazolo its neck has galled<BR>
With one of those keen darts, Apollo&#8217;s fee,<BR>
Given with his bow, what time as well his glaive,<BR>
The god of war, to gird that warrior, gave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Two Hercules and two Hippolyti<BR>
Of Este, a Hercules and Hippolyte<BR>
Of the Gonzagas&#8217; and the Medici,<BR>
Hunt and fatigue the monster in his flight:<BR>
Nor Julian lets his good son pass him by;<BR>
Nor bold Ferrant his brother; nor less wight<BR>
Is Andrew Doria; nor by any one<BR>
Is Francis Sforza in the chase outdone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of good Avalo&#8217;s glorious lineage bred,<BR>
Two chiefs that mountain for their bearing show,<BR>
Which, hiding him, from dragon-feet to head,<BR>
The wicked Typheus seems to keep below.<BR>
&#8217;Mid those combined, to lay the monster dead,<BR>
Shall none more forward than this couple go:<BR>
Him Francis of Pescara names the text;<BR>
Alphonso, hight of Guasto, is the next.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But where leave I Gonsalvo Ferrant, who<BR>
Is held in such esteem, the pride of Spain?<BR>
So praised by Malagigi, that him few<BR>
Equal among the worthies of that train.<BR>
William, surnamed of Monferrato, view<BR>
&#8217;Mid those that have the hideous monster slain:<BR>
But these are few compared with numbers round,<BR>
Whom that despiteous Beast shall kill or wound.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
To converse gay the friends themselves addrest,<BR>
And seemly pastimes, when their meal was done,<BR>
Through the hot noontide, and fine carpets prest,<BR>
&#8217;Mid shrubs, by which the limpid river run.<BR>
Vivian and Malagigi, that the rest<BR>
Might be more tranquil, watched with armour on;<BR>
When unaccompanied they saw a dame,<BR>
Who quickly towards their place of shelter came;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Hippalca she; from whom was torn away<BR>
Frontino, that good horse, by Rodomont:<BR>
Him had she long pursued the former day,<BR>
And now with prayer, now followed with affront.<BR>
Which booting nought, she had retraced her way,<BR>
To seek Rogero out in Agrismont;<BR>
And, how I know not, heard upon her round,<BR>
He here with Richardetto would be found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
And, for to her well known was that repair,<BR>
Used by her often, she herself addrest<BR>
Towards the fount, and in that quarter fair<BR>
Found him, and in what manner, was exprest;<BR>
But like embassadress, who&#8212;wise and ware&#8212;<BR>
Better than was enjoined performs a hest,<BR>
When Richardetto she beheld, made show<BR>
As if she good Rogero did not know.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
She turned her wholly to Sir Richardet,<BR>
As bound direct to him; and, on his side,<BR>
He who well knew her, straight uprose and met,<BR>
And asked that damsel whitherward she hied.<BR>
Hippalca, with her eyes yet red and wet<BR>
From her long weeping, sighing deeply, cried,<BR>
But cried aloud, that young Rogero, near<BR>
The warrior she addrest, her tale might hear:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I from Mount Alban with a courser sped;<BR>
(So your good sister had commanded me)<BR>
A horse much loved by her, and highly bred;<BR>
Frontino is yclept that charger free;<BR>
And him I more than thirty miles had led<BR>
Towards Marseilles, where she designed to be<BR>
Within few days; by her enjoined to wend<BR>
Thither, and her arrival there attend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I in the sure belief pursued my course,<BR>
Was none so stout of heart, if I should say<BR>
How Sir Rinaldo&#8217;s sister owned the horse,<BR>
He would presume to take that steed away.<BR>
But vain was my design; for him parforce<BR>
A Saracen took from me yesterday:<BR>
Nor, when to him his master&#8217;s name I read,<BR>
Will that bold robber render back the steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Him I to-day and all the day before<BR>
Have prayed, and prayer and menace proving vain,<BR>
Aye cursing him and execrating sore,<BR>
Have left at little distance; where, with pain,<BR>
Both to his courser and himself, the Moor,<BR>
As best he can, a combat does maintain<BR>
Against a knight, who him so hard has prest,<BR>
I trust my injury shall be redrest.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
At this Rogero, leaping on his feet,<BR>
Who scarcely had endured the whole to hear,<BR>
To Richardetto turned; and, as a meet<BR>
Guerdon for his good deed, the cavalier<BR>
Did, with beseechings infinite, entreat<BR>
To let him singly with that damsel steer,<BR>
Until she showed the paynim, who by force<BR>
Had wrested from her hands that goodly horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Richardet (though it seems discourtesy<BR>
To yield to other champion that emprize,<BR>
Which by himself should terminated be)<BR>
Yet with Rogero&#8217;s earnest suit complies;<BR>
Who takes farewell of that good company,<BR>
And with the damsel on her journey hies.<BR>
And leaves those others, whom his feats confound,<BR>
Not merely lost in wonder, but astoud.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
To him Hippalca said, when she apart<BR>
Had drawn him to some distance from the rest,<BR>
She was dispatched by her that in her heart<BR>
Bore of his worth the image so imprest;<BR>
&#8212;And added, without using farther art,<BR>
All that her lady had to him addrest;<BR>
And if she told another tale whilere,<BR>
Of Richardetto she was then in fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
She added how the author of that deed<BR>
Had also said to her with mickle pride;<BR>
&#8220;Because I know Rogero owns the steed,<BR>
More willingly I take him from his guide.<BR>
If he would repossess the courser, read<BR>
To him what I have no desire to hide,<BR>
I am that Rodomont, whose martial worth<BR>
Scatters its splendour through this ample earth.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Listening, the visage of the youthful knight<BR>
Showed with what rage his heart was in a flame,<BR>
As well as that the horse was his delight;<BR>
As well upon account of whence it came;<BR>
And also that &#8217;twas reft in his despite;<BR>
He sees dishonour will ensue and blame,<BR>
Save he from Rodomont redeems the prey,<BR>
And with a due revenge that wrong repay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
With him, without repose, the damsel rides,<BR>
Who with his foe would bring him front to front;<BR>
And thither journies where the road divides,<BR>
And one branch cuts the plain, one climbs the mount,<BR>
And either pathway to that valley guides,<BR>
Where she had newly left King Rodomont,<BR>
The mountain track was short, but trod with pain;<BR>
That other longer far, but smooth and plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Hippalca&#8217;s ardour to retrieve the prey,<BR>
And upon Rodomont&#8217;s avenge the wrong,<BR>
Incites that maid the mountain to assay;<BR>
By which (as said) the journey was less long:<BR>
While Mandricardo, Rodomont, and they<BR>
Of whom I erst made mention in my song,<BR>
That easier track across the level hold;<BR>
And thus encounter not Rogero bold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Until King Agramant shall succoured be,<BR>
Suspended is their quarrel (in what wise<BR>
You know), and in the champions&#8217; company<BR>
Doralice, cause of all their discord, hies.<BR>
Now hear the upshot of this history!<BR>
Their way directly by that fountain lies,<BR>
Beside whose margin are in pastime met<BR>
Marphisa and Aldigier and Richardet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Marphisa had, at her companions&#8217; prayer,<BR>
Cloathed her in female ornaments and vest,<BR>
Of those, which by Maganza&#8217;s traitour were<BR>
Late to Lanfusa, in full trust, addrest;<BR>
And, though the appearance of that maid was rare<BR>
Without her corslet, casque and all the rest,<BR>
&#8212;At their entreaty, these for once laid down&#8212;<BR>
She deigned to seem a maid and donned the gown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
As soon as Mandricardo saw her face,<BR>
In trust that, could he win her in affray,<BR>
He would that maid, in recompense and place<BR>
Of Doralice, to Rodomont convey;<BR>
As if Love trafficked in such contracts base,<BR>
And lover could his lady change away,<BR>
Nor yet with reason at the event be pained,<BR>
If he in losing one another gained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Hence with a damsel to provide the peer,<BR>
That he himself the other may retain;<BR>
Deeming her worthy any cavalier,<BR>
He would by force of arms the maid obtain;<BR>
And, as if he could suddenly hold dear<BR>
This maid as that, on him bestow the gain;<BR>
And all of those, whom he about her spied,<BR>
Forthwith to joust and single fight defied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Vivian and Malagigi (who were dight<BR>
In arms, as guard and surety for the rest,)<BR>
One and the other champion&#8212;prompt for fight,<BR>
Rose lightly from the herbage which they prest,<BR>
Deeming they had to joust with either knight;<BR>
But Rodomont, who came not on this quest,<BR>
No motion made as he a course would run;<BR>
So that they had to tourney but with one.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Sir Vivian is the first who moves his horse,<BR>
With mighty heart, and lays his weapon low;<BR>
And he, that Tartar king, renowned for force,<BR>
With greater puissance meets the coming foe.<BR>
His lance each warrior levels in the course<BR>
Where he bests trusts to plant the furious blow.<BR>
Vainly Sir Vivian&#8217;s spear the casque offends;<BR>
Nor throws that paynim knight, nor even bends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
That Tartar&#8217;s harder weapon makes the shield<BR>
Of Vivian, at their onset, fly like grass;<BR>
And, tumbling from his saddle on the field,<BR>
Extends the champion amid flowers and grass.<BR>
To run his chance Sir Malagigi, steeled,<BR>
Did to his brother&#8217;s succour quickly pass;<BR>
But (such that warrior&#8217;s hurry to be near)<BR>
Rather accompanied, than venged the peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
The other of those brethren armed before<BR>
His cousin, and had backed his courser wight;<BR>
And, having first defied, encountered sore,<BR>
Spurring with flowing rein, the stranger knight.<BR>
Against the tempered helm that pagan wore<BR>
Sounded the blow, an inch below the sight:<BR>
Heaven-high the truncheon flew, in fragments broke,<BR>
But the stout pagan winced not for the stroke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Him on the left side smote that paynim peer,<BR>
And (for the blow was with huge force designed)<BR>
Little his shield, and less his iron gear,<BR>
Availed, which opened like the yielding rhind:<BR>
The weapon pierced his shoulder; Aldigier<BR>
Now right now left upon his horse inclined;<BR>
Then him, &#8217;mid grass and flowers, his comrades view,<BR>
With arms of crimson, face of pallid, hue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Next Richardetto comes, and for the blow<BR>
Intended, levels such a mighty lance,<BR>
He showed himself, as he was wont to show,<BR>
Worthy to be a paladin of France;<BR>
And has stamped signs of this upon the foe.<BR>
If he had warred on him with equal chance;<BR>
But prostrate rolled, encumbered by his steed;<BR>
Nor fell the courser through his lord&#8217;s misdeed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
When knight appeared not on the other side,<BR>
Who should in joust the paynim king affront,<BR>
He thought the damsel was his prize, and hied<BR>
Thither, where she was seated by the fount.<BR>
And&#8212;&#8220;Lady, you are mine,&#8221; the Tartar cried,<BR>
&#8220;Save other champion in your succour mount;<BR>
Nor can you make denial or excuse,<BR>
Since such the right of war and common use.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Marphisa raised her face with haughty cheer,<BR>
And answered him: &#8220;Thy judgment wanders far;<BR>
I will concede thy sentence would be clear,<BR>
Concluding I am thine by right of war,<BR>
If either were my lord or cavalier<BR>
Of those, by thee unhorsed in bloody jar:<BR>
Nor theirs am I, nor other&#8217;s, but my own,<BR>
Who wins me, wins me from myself alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I too with lance and sword do doughty deed,<BR>
And more than one good knight on earth have laid.<BR>
&#8212;Give me,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;my armour and my steed.&#8221;<BR>
And readily her squires that hest obeyed:<BR>
Then in her waistcoat stood, of flowing weed<BR>
Despoiled, with well-knit from and charms displayed;<BR>
And in all points (such strength she shewed and grace)<BR>
Resembled heavenly Mars, except her face.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
The damsel donned her sword, when armed all o&#8217;er,<BR>
And on her courser leapt with nimble spring;<BR>
And, right and left, she made him, thrice or more<BR>
Poised on his haunches, turn in narrow ring.<BR>
And, levelling the sturdy lance she bore,<BR>
Defied, and next assailed, the Tartar king.<BR>
So combating with Peleus&#8217; son, of yore,<BR>
Penthesilaea warred on Trojan shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Like brittle crystal, in that proud career,<BR>
The weapons at the rest to pieces went;<BR>
Yet neither of those warriors, &#8217;twould appear,<BR>
Backwards one inch at their encounter bent.<BR>
Marphisa, who would willingly be clear<BR>
What of a closer fight would be the event,<BR>
For a new combat with the paynim lord,<BR>
Wheeled, to attack that warrior with the sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
That Tartar cursed the elements and sky,<BR>
When her he saw remaining in her sell;<BR>
And she, who thought to make his buckler fly,<BR>
Cursed heaven as loudly as that infidel.<BR>
Already were their faulchions raised on high,<BR>
Which on the enchanted arms like hammers fell:<BR>
Enchanted arms both combatants enclose,<BR>
Never more needed by those deadly foes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
So perfect are the champions&#8217; plate and chain,<BR>
They thrust or cut of spear or faulchion stay;<BR>
So that the two the battle might maintain,<BR>
Throughout this and throughout another day:<BR>
But Rodomont leaps in between the twain,<BR>
And taxes Mandricardo with delay;<BR>
Crying, &#8220;If battle here is to be done,<BR>
Finish we that which we to-day begun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;We made a truce, thou knowest, upon pact<BR>
Of furnishing our baffled forces aid;<BR>
Nor foe in joust or fight can be attacked<BR>
By us with justice till this debt be paid.&#8221;<BR>
Then to Marphisa he in reverent act<BR>
Addressed himself, and of that courier said;<BR>
And next recounted to the martial dame,<BR>
How seeking aid for Agramant he came.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Next prays not only with that Tartar knight<BR>
She will abandon or defer the fray;<BR>
But that, Troyano&#8217;s valiant son to right,<BR>
She will, together with them, wend her way;<BR>
By which her warlike fame a higher flight,<BR>
More easily may, even to heaven, assay,<BR>
Than in a quarrel of such paltry guise,<BR>
Which offers hindrance to such fair emprize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa, who had evermore in thought<BR>
To prove the paladins of Charles, and who<BR>
To France was over land and ocean brought,<BR>
From clime so distant, with no other view,<BR>
Than by her own experience to be taught<BR>
If their far-spread renown were false or true,<BR>
Resolved together with the troop to speed,<BR>
As soon as she had heard their monarch&#8217;s need.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile Rogero, with that guiding may,<BR>
Had vainly by the rugged pathway sped;<BR>
Who that king Rodomont another way<BR>
Had taken, when he reached the mountain, read;<BR>
And thinking, that he was not far away,<BR>
And the road straight towards that fountain led,<BR>
Trotting in haste behind the Sarzan hied,<BR>
Where he new prints upon the path espied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Hippalca he to Mont Albano prayed,<BR>
To wend, which distant one day&#8217;s journey lies;<BR>
Because to seek anew that fountain-glade,<BR>
Would be to wander in too wide a guise.<BR>
And that she need not doubt withal, he said,<BR>
But that he would retrieve the ravished prize.<BR>
And, were she in Mount Alban&#8212;or where&#8217;er&#8212;<BR>
Vowed she the tidings speedily should hear,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
And gave the letter to that maid to bear,<BR>
Which, writ by him, he in his bosom wore,<BR>
And added many matters, with the prayer,<BR>
She would excuse him by her friendly lore.<BR>
Hippalca in her memory fixt, with care,<BR>
The whole; took leave, and turned her horse once more:<BR>
Nor ceased that faithful messenger to ride<BR>
Till she Mount Alban reached at evening-tide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Rogero followed fast the paynim knight,<BR>
Tracked o&#8217;er the level by those footsteps new,<BR>
But overtook him not, till he got sight,<BR>
Beside the fount, of Mandricardo too.<BR>
Already either had his promise plight,<BR>
He nought unknown to his compeer would do,<BR>
Till they had succour to that host conveyed,<BR>
On which King Charles his yoke had nearly laid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
Arrived, Rogero knew Frontino gay,<BR>
And, through that courser, knew the knight astride;<BR>
And on his lance with bending shoulder lay,<BR>
And in fierce tone the African defied.<BR>
Job was outdone by Rodomont that day,<BR>
In that the king subdued his haughty pride,<BR>
And the fell fight which he had ever used<BR>
To seek with every instance, he refused.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
The first day this and last, that e&#8217;er in fight<BR>
King Rodomont refused his part to bear!<BR>
But his desire appeared to him so right,<BR>
In succour of his sovereign to repair;<BR>
That if he had believed he clutched the knight<BR>
Faster than nimble leopard gripes the hare,<BR>
He not so far his purpose would forego,<BR>
As on his prey to waste a passing blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Add, that he knows Rogero is the peer<BR>
Who him for good Frontino now assails;<BR>
&#8212;So famous, that no other cavalier<BR>
Like him such eminence of glory scales;<BR>
&#8212;The man, of whom he gladly would be clear,<BR>
By proof, how much in battle he avails:<BR>
Yet shuns the combat, proffered on his part;<BR>
So much his monarch&#8217;s siege has he at heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Three hundred miles, a thousand, would he ride,<BR>
&#8212;Were it not so&#8212;to purchase such affray;<BR>
But he, if him Achilles had defied,<BR>
Had done no otherwise than as I say;<BR>
So deeply did the covering ashes hide<BR>
That fire beneath, whose fury stifled lay:<BR>
He told why he refused the strife; and prayed,<BR>
As well Rogero the design to aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Adding that he, in doing so, would do<BR>
What to his lord a faithful vassal owes;<BR>
Still, when the siege was raised, might they renew<BR>
And terminate their deadly strife by blows.<BR>
To him Rogero cried, &#8220;The fight with you<BR>
I freely will defer, till from his foes<BR>
King Agramant be rescued by the sword;<BR>
Provided first Frontino be restored.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Would you that I delay to prove by deed,<BR>
That you have acted in unworthy sort,<BR>
&#8212;Nor did, like valiant man, to take my steed<BR>
Thus from a woman&#8212;till we meet at court,<BR>
Render me my Frontino back, or read,<BR>
Upon no other ground, will I support<BR>
That battle shall not be between us two;<BR>
Nor will accord an hour of truce to you.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
While of that African he so demands<BR>
Frontino, or him threats with instant fray;<BR>
And either still the other&#8217;s claim withstands,<BR>
Nor this the steed will grant, nor that delay;<BR>
King Mandricardo stirs, on the other hand,<BR>
Another strife; who sees that ensign gay<BR>
Rogero on his shield was wont to wear,<BR>
The bird which reigns o&#8217;er other fowls of air.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
He bore on azure field that eagle white,<BR>
The beauteous ensign of the Trojan throng:<BR>
Such glorious bearing showed that youthful knight,<BR>
Because he drew his line from Hector strong.<BR>
But Mandricardo knew not of this right,<BR>
Nor would endure&#8212;and deemed a crying wrong,<BR>
That any other but himself should wield<BR>
Famed Hector&#8217;s argent eagle on his shield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
King Mandricardo is like blazon wore<BR>
The bird of Ide, which bore off Ganymede:<BR>
How in the castle perilous of yore,<BR>
He gained that noble ensign for his meed,<BR>
&#8212;That enterprize I ween, with matter more,<BR>
You bear in mind, and how, for his good deed,<BR>
The fairy gave it him with all the gear,<BR>
Erst given by Vulcan to the Trojan peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
The Tartar and Rogero had before<BR>
Engaged in battle, only on this quest,<BR>
Divided by what accident, my lore<BR>
Recites not, as already manifest:<BR>
Nor had till now those knights encountered more:<BR>
When Mandricardo sees that bird imprest<BR>
On the Child&#8217;s shield, he shouts with threatening cry<BR>
To young Rogero: &#8220;Take my proud defy!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Audacious man, mine ensign do&#8217;st thou wear,<BR>
Nor this to-day for the first time, is said;<BR>
And think&#8217;st thou, madman, I will thee forbear,<BR>
Because for once to spare thee I was led?<BR>
But since nor menace nor yet counsel are<BR>
Of force to drive this folly from thy head,<BR>
It shall appear how much it had been best<BR>
For thee forthwith to have obeyed my hest.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As fire, whereon dry, heated wood is strown,<BR>
Roused by a little puff, at once ascends,<BR>
So burns Rogero&#8217;s wrath, to fury blown,<BR>
By the first word with which that king offends.<BR>
&#8220;Thou thinkest,&#8221; he exclaims, &#8220;to bear me down,<BR>
Because his knight as well with me contends:<BR>
But learn that I can win in fighting field<BR>
From him the horse, from thee good Hector&#8217;s shield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet once before&#8212;nor is it long ago&#8212;<BR>
Twixt us in battle was this question tried:<BR>
But I that day restrained the murderous blow,<BR>
Because thou hadst no faulchion at thy side.<BR>
These shall be deeds, that strife was but a show;<BR>
And ill this argent bird shall thee betide;<BR>
This is the ancient bearing of my line;<BR>
Tis thou usurpest what by right is mine.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;Say rather, thou usurpest mine from me&#8221;;<BR>
Cried Mandricardo; and that faulchion drew,<BR>
Which lately, underneath the greenwood tree,<BR>
Orlando from his hand in fury threw.<BR>
The Child, who could not aught but courteous be,<BR>
(Such was his gentle nature) at the view<BR>
Of Mandricardo, with his faulchion drawn,<BR>
Let fall his ready lance upon the lawn;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
And at the same time, strained his goodly sword;<BR>
And better braced the covering shield he wore:<BR>
But &#8217;twixt those combatants leapt Argier&#8217;s lord,<BR>
And quick Marphisa spurred the pair before;<BR>
And one this foe, the other that implored,<BR>
And both besought, that they would strive no more.<BR>
King Rodomont complains the Tartar knight<BR>
Has violated twice the compact plight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
First, in belief he should Marphisa gain,<BR>
He more than once had jousted for that fair;<BR>
Now to bear off Rogero&#8217;s ensign fain,<BR>
He for king Agramant shows little care.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;If thus&#8221; (said Rodomont) &#8220;you faith maintain,<BR>
To finish our own combat better were,<BR>
A cause of strife more fitting and more due<BR>
Than either of the pleas maintained by you.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;On this condition was the treaty plight,<BR>
And the accord between us now in force;<BR>
When I with thee shall have performed the fight,<BR>
I next shall answer him about the horse:<BR>
You then with him, if you survive, your right<BR>
Shall to the shield maintain in warlike course.<BR>
But I such work shall give you, I conceive,<BR>
As will small labour for Rogero leave.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;The bargain which thou hopest thou shalt not have,&#8221;<BR>
(King Mandricardo answered Rodomont)<BR>
&#8220;I will accord thee more than thou do&#8217;st crave,<BR>
And trust to make thee sweat from feet to front.<BR>
And to bestow on others, much shall save,<BR>
As water never fails in plenteous font;<BR>
And for Rogero and a thousand more,<BR>
And all the world beside reserve a store.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
Their fury waxed, and angrier words ensued,<BR>
Now upon this and now upon that side.<BR>
With Rodomont and with the Child at feud,<BR>
Fierce Mandricardo both at once defied.<BR>
Rogero, not endowed with suffering mood,<BR>
Would hear no more of peace, but vengeance cried.<BR>
Now here Marphisa hurried, and now there,<BR>
But could not singly such an ill repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
As peasant, when a river saps its mounds,<BR>
And seeking vent the oozing waters drop,<BR>
Hastening to shut the stream within its bounds,<BR>
And save his pastures and expected crop,<BR>
Dams right and left; yet him the stream confounds:<BR>
For, if he here the sinking ruin prop,<BR>
There he beholds the rotten dyke give out,<BR>
And from thick seams the restless water spout,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
So, while the Tartar and Rogero rage,<BR>
And Rodomont, in hurly-burly fray,<BR>
For each of these would fiercest battle wage,<BR>
And would outgo his fears in that assay,<BR>
Marphisa seeks their fury to assuage,<BR>
And strives, and time and trouble throws away;<BR>
For as she makes one knight from strife retire,<BR>
She sees the others re-engage with ire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa, to appease the warriors bent,<BR>
Exclaimed, &#8220;Sirs, listen to my better lore;<BR>
A good remembrance &#8217;tis, all argument<BR>
To leave until we Agramant restore.<BR>
If each is on his own design intent,<BR>
With Mandricardo will I strive once more;<BR>
And fain would see, according to his word,<BR>
If he can conquer me with spear and sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if, to aid our sovereign, duty call,<BR>
Him let us aid, nor civil discord breed.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;To ground, through me, such project shall not fall,&#8221;<BR>
Rogero said, &#8220;so he restore my steed.<BR>
Let him resign that horse, or&#8212;once for all.<BR>
I say again&#8212;to his defence take heed.<BR>
I either here my parting breath will yield,<BR>
Or on my courser will return afield.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;Twere not so easy to obtain this quest<BR>
As &#8217;twere that other,&#8221; Rodomont replied;<BR>
And thus pursued: &#8220;I unto thee protest,<BR>
If any evil shall our king betide,<BR>
Thine is the fault not mine; for I am prest<BR>
To do whate&#8217;er is fitting, on my side.&#8221;<BR>
Small heed to that protest Rogero paid,<BR>
And stung by fury, griped his trenchant blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
On Argier&#8217;s king he sprang, like savage boar,<BR>
Encountering him with shoulder and with shield;<BR>
And him disordered and distrest so sore,<BR>
That with one stirrup&#8217;s loss, the monarch reeled.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Rogero,&#8221; Mandricardo cried, &#8220;give o&#8217;er,<BR>
Or else with me divide the battle-field&#8221;;<BR>
And struck, this said, with worse than felon spite,<BR>
Upon the morion of that youthful knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
Even to his courser&#8217;s neck Rogero bends;<BR>
Nor, when he would, himself can rear;<BR>
Because the sword of Ulien&#8217;s son descends<BR>
As well upon the youthful cavalier;<BR>
And, but that adamant his face defends,<BR>
Across the cheeks his tempered helm would sheer.<BR>
The Child, in anguish, opens either hand;<BR>
And this the bridle drops and that the brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
Him o&#8217;er the field his courser bears away;<BR>
On earth the faulchion lies, which he let go:<BR>
Marphisa (with Rogero&#8217;s through that day,<BR>
Comrade in arms) appeared like fire to glow,<BR>
Enraged, that two one knight should overlay;<BR>
And, as magnanimous and stout, for foe<BR>
Singled King Mandricardo out, and sped,<BR>
With all her might, stroke upon his head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
Rodomont o&#8217;er the plain pursues his man.<BR>
&#8212;Another stroke, and he has lost the horse!<BR>
But Richardetto drives, and Vivian,<BR>
Between the Child and paynim in that course.<BR>
This warrior at the king of Argier ran,<BR>
And from Rogero severed him by force;<BR>
That (it was Vivian) in Rogero&#8217;s hand,<BR>
Now from the blow recovered, placed his brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
As soon as to himself the Child returns,<BR>
And is by Vivian armed with sword again,<BR>
To venge the injury that stripling burns,<BR>
And runs at Rodomont with flowing rein,<BR>
Like lion, whom a bull upon his horns<BR>
Has lifted, though he feels this while no pain,<BR>
So him his heat of blood, disdain, and ire,<BR>
To venge that cruel outrage goad and fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
Rogero storms upon the paynim&#8217;s crest;<BR>
And, could that knight recover his own brand,<BR>
Which by foul felony (as erst exprest)<BR>
Was ravished from the youthful warrior&#8217;s hand,<BR>
I well believe that the descending pest<BR>
Rodomont&#8217;s iron casque will ill withstand;<BR>
That casque which Babel&#8217;s king bade forge, who sought<BR>
To war on Heaven in his presumptuous thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
Discord, believing nothing could ensue<BR>
But stir, and strife, and combat on that head;<BR>
And that there was no place, amid the crew,<BR>
For truce or treaty, to her sister said,<BR>
That she, her well-beloved monks to view,<BR>
Might now again with her securely tread.<BR>
Let them depart; and mark we where in front<BR>
Rogero has sore wounded Rodomont.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero&#8217;s blow was levelled with such spite,<BR>
That this upon Frontino&#8217;s crupper made<BR>
The helmet and the shell of iron smite,<BR>
In which that Saracen his limbs arrayed;<BR>
And he, three times or four, to left and right,<BR>
&#8212;As if about to fall&#8212;head-foremost, swayed;<BR>
And would have lost withal his trusty brand,<BR>
But that the hilt was fastened to his hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
Marphisa has king Mandricardo prest<BR>
Meanwhile, and makes him sweat breast, front, and face;<BR>
And he Marphisa has as sore distrest:<BR>
But such good plates each valiant bosom case,<BR>
Impassable is either iron vest;<BR>
And both have hitherto maintained their place.<BR>
But, at a turn her martial courser made,<BR>
Marphisa needed young Rogero&#8217;s aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
Marphisa&#8217;s martial steed, in turning short,<BR>
Where a firm footing that soft mead denied,<BR>
On the moist surface slipt, and in such sort,<BR>
That he fell, helpless, on his better side;<BR>
And, as he rose in haste and lacked support,<BR>
Athwart by furious Brigliador was plied;<BR>
On which the paynim, little courteous, came;<BR>
So that he fell anew beneath the dame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
Rogero, when Marphisa on the ground<BR>
He saw unhorsed, deferred no more his aid;<BR>
Who for that deed had leisure; since, astound,<BR>
Rodomont far away had been conveyed:<BR>
He smote the morion which that Tartar crowned;<BR>
And, cleft like stalk, his head on earth had laid,<BR>
Had he his trusty Balisarda born,<BR>
Or Mandricardo other helmet worn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
Rodomont, of his senses repossest,<BR>
Turned round this while, and Richardetto spied;<BR>
And recollecting how, when late distrest,<BR>
He to Rogero succour had supplied,<BR>
Quickly against that youthful warrior prest;<BR>
Who an ill guerdon would from him abide,<BR>
Did Malagigi not his malice thwart<BR>
With other magic and with mickle art.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Sage Malagigi versed in every sleight<BR>
Which by the wisest wizard can be done;<BR>
Although his book he has not, by whose might,<BR>
He in his course can stop the passing sun;<BR>
The conjuration recollects and rite,<BR>
By which he tames the rebel fiends; and one<BR>
Bids enter into Doralice&#8217;s steed,<BR>
Whom he to fury stings and headlong speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
Into that gentle palfrey&#8217;s form, who bore<BR>
The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane,<BR>
Sir Vivian&#8217;s brother, simply by his lore,<BR>
Made pass an angel of the dark domain;<BR>
And the good horse, who never moved before,<BR>
Except in due obedience to the rein,<BR>
Now took a leap, possest by that ill sprite,<BR>
Thirty feet long and sixteen feet in height.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
It was a mighty leap, yet not so wide<BR>
As to make any rider void the sell.<BR>
Seeing herself so high in air, loud cried,<BR>
(Yielding herself for dead) that bonnibel.<BR>
Her palfrey, with the Daemon for his guide,<BR>
After his leap, runs, goaded by the spell<BR>
(The maid still screaming) such a furious course,<BR>
An arrow had not reached the flying horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
At the first hearing of that voice, the son<BR>
Of Ulien, on his part, the strife suspended;<BR>
And thither, where the furious palfrey run,<BR>
Swiftly in succour of the lady wended.<BR>
No less was by the Tartar monarch done;<BR>
Who neither Child nor damsel more offended;<BR>
But without craving time, or truce, or peace,<BR>
Pursued King Rodomont and Doralice.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa rose meanwhile, to fury stirred;<BR>
And, with disdain all over in a glow,<BR>
Thought to accomplish her revenge, and erred:<BR>
For at too great a distance was the foe.<BR>
Rogero, who beheld the war deferred,<BR>
Rather like lion roared than sighed: well know<BR>
Those two their coursers they should vainly gore,<BR>
Following Frontino and good Brigliador.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero will not halt till he renew<BR>
And end the unfinished combat for the horse;<BR>
Marphisa will not quit that Tartar, who<BR>
Will to her satisfaction prove his force.<BR>
To leave their quarrel in such guise the two<BR>
Esteem foul scandal; as their better course,<BR>
In chase of those offending knights to fare,<BR>
Is the conclusion of that valiant pair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
They in the paynim camp will find each foe,<BR>
If them before they find not on their way;<BR>
Whom thither bound, to raise the siege they know,<BR>
Ere Charlemagne bring all beneath his sway.<BR>
So thitherward the twain directly go<BR>
Where these, they deem, will be their certain prey.<BR>
Yet not so rudely thence Rogero broke,<BR>
But that he first with his companion spoke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXV.</TD><TD>
Thither returns Rogero, where apart<BR>
Is he, the brother of his lady fair;<BR>
And vows himself his friend, with generous heart,<BR>
In good or evil fortune, everywhere.<BR>
Him he implores&#8212;and frames his speech with art&#8212;<BR>
He his salutes will to his sister bear;<BR>
And this so well, he moves by that request<BR>
No doubt in him, nor any of the rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Of Malagigi he and Viviane<BR>
Next takes farewell and wounded Aldigier;<BR>
Their services no less that kindly twain<BR>
Proffer, as ever debtors to the peer.<BR>
Marphisa to seek Paris is so fain,<BR>
That parting she forgets her friends to cheer;<BR>
But Malagigi and Vivian, in pursuit,<BR>
Follow, and from afar that maid salute;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVII.</TD><TD>
And so Sir Richardet as well: but low<BR>
On earth lies Aldigier, and there must rest.<BR>
The two first champions towards Paris go,<BR>
And the two others next pursue that quest.<BR>
In other canto, Sir, I hope to show<BR>
Of wondrous and of superhuman gest,<BR>
Wrought to the damage of the Christian king,<BR>
By those two couples of whose worth I sing.</TD></TR>
