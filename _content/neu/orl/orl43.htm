<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Rinaldo from his courteous landlord hears<BR>
What folly had destroyed his every good;<BR>
Next learns another story, as he steers<BR>
Toward Ravenna with the falling flood:<BR>
Then last arrives where, conqueror o&#8217;er his foes<BR>
Orlando was, but in no joyful mood.<BR>
He, that the Child a Christian made whilere,<BR>
Christens Sobrino, and heals Olivier.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
O Execrable avarice! O vile thirst<BR>
Of sordid gold! it doth not me astound<BR>
So easily thou seizest soul, immersed<BR>
In baseness, or with other taint unsound;<BR>
But that thy chain should bind, amid the worst,<BR>
And that thy talon should strike down and wound<BR>
One that for loftiness of mind would be<BR>
Worthy all praise, if he avoided thee.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Some earth and sea and heaven above us square,<BR>
Know Nature&#8217;s causes, works, and properties;<BR>
What her beginnings, what her endings are;<BR>
And soar till Heaven is open to their eyes:<BR>
Yet have no steadier aim, no better care,<BR>
Stung by thy venom, than, in sordid wise,<BR>
To gather treasure: such their single scope,<BR>
Their every comfort, and their every hope.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Armies by him are broken in his pride,<BR>
And gates of warlike towns in triumph past:<BR>
The foremost he to breast the furious tide<BR>
Of fearful battle; to retire the last;<BR>
Yet cannot save himself from being stied<BR>
Till death, in thy dark dungeon prisoned fast.<BR>
Of others that would shine thou dimm&#8217;st the praise;<BR>
Whom other studies, other arts would raise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
What shall of high and beauteous dames be said?<BR>
Who (from their lovers&#8217; worth and charms secure)<BR>
Against long service, I behold, more staid,<BR>
More motionless, than marble shafts, endure:<BR>
Then Avarice comes, who so her spells hath laid,<BR>
I see them stoop directly to her lure.<BR>
&#8212;Who could believe?&#8212;unloving, in a day<BR>
They fall some elder&#8217;s, fall some monster&#8217;s prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Not without reason here I raise this cry:<BR>
&#8212;Read me who can, I read myself&#8212;nor so<BR>
I from the beaten pathway tread awry,<BR>
Nor thus the matter of my song forego.<BR>
Not more to what is shown do I apply<BR>
My saying, than to what I have to show.<BR>
But now return we to the paladine,<BR>
Who was about to taste the enchanted wine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Fain would he think awhile, of whom I speak,<BR>
(As said) ere to his lips the vase he bore;<BR>
He thought; then thus: &#8220;When finding what we seek<BR>
Displeases, this &#8217;tis folly to explore,<BR>
My wife&#8217;s a woman; every woman&#8217;s weak.<BR>
Then let me hold the faith I held before.<BR>
Faith still has brought, and yet contentment brings.<BR>
From proof itself what better profit springs?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;From this small good, much evil I foresee:<BR>
For tempting God moves sometimes his disdain.<BR>
I know not if it wise or foolish be,<BR>
But to know more than needs, I am not fain.<BR>
Now put away the enchanted cup from me;<BR>
I neither will, nor would, the goblet drain;<BR>
Which is with Heaven&#8217;s command as much at strife,<BR>
As Adam&#8217;s deed who robbed the tree of life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For as our sire who tasted of that tree,<BR>
And God&#8217;s own word, by eating, disobeyed,<BR>
Fell into sorrow from felicity,<BR>
And was by misery evermore o&#8217;erlaid;<BR>
The husband so, that all would know and see;<BR>
Whatever by his wife is done and said;<BR>
Passes from happiness to grief and pain,<BR>
Nor ever can uplift his head again.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile the good Rinaldo saying so,<BR>
And pushing from himself the cup abhorred,<BR>
Beheld of tears a plenteous fountain flow<BR>
From the full eyes of that fair mansion&#8217;s lord;<BR>
Who cried, now having somewhat calmed his woe,<BR>
&#8220;Accursed be he, persuaded by whose word,<BR>
Alas! I of the fortune made assay,<BR>
Whereby my cherished wife was reft away!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Wherefore ten years ago wast thou not known,<BR>
So that I counselled might have been of thee?<BR>
Before the sorrows and the grief begun,<BR>
That have nigh quenched my eyes; but raised shall be<BR>
The curtain from the scene, that thou upon<BR>
My pain mayst look, and mayst lament with me;<BR>
And I to thee of mine unheard-of woe<BR>
The argument and very head will show.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Above, was left a neighbouring city, pent<BR>
Within a limpid stream that forms a lake;<BR>
Which widens, and wherein Po finds a vent.<BR>
Their way the waters from Benacus take.<BR>
Built was the city, when to ruin went<BR>
Walls founded by the Agenorean snake.<BR>
Here me of gentle line my mother bore,<BR>
But of small means, in humble home and poor.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If Fortune&#8217;s care I was not, who denied<BR>
To me upon my birth a wealthy boon,<BR>
Nature that went with graceful form supplied;<BR>
So that in beauty rival had I none.<BR>
Enamoured of me in youth&#8217;s early tide<BR>
Erewhile was dame and damsel more than one:<BR>
For I with beauty coupled winning ways;<BR>
Though it becomes not man himself to praise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A sage within our city dwelled, a wight,<BR>
Beyond belief, in every science great;<BR>
Who, when he closed his eyes on Ph&#339;bus&#8217; light,<BR>
Numbered one hundred years, one score and eight:<BR>
A savage life he led and out of sight,<BR>
Until impelled by love, the senior late<BR>
By dint of gifts obtained a matron fair,<BR>
Who secretly to him a daughter bare;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And to prevent the child from being won,<BR>
As was erewhile the mother, that for gain<BR>
Bartered her chastity, whose worth alone<BR>
Excels what gold earth&#8217;s ample veins contain,<BR>
With her he from the ways of man is gone,<BR>
And where he spies the loneliest place, his train<BR>
Of demons forces, in enchantment skilled,<BR>
This dome so spacious, fair, and rich, to build.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By ancient and chaste dames he there made rear<BR>
This daughter, that in sovereign beauty grew;<BR>
Nor suffered her to see or even hear<BR>
A man beside himself; and, for her view,<BR>
&#8212;Lest lights should lack, whereby her course to steer&#8212;<BR>
The senior every modest lady, who<BR>
E&#8217;er on unlawful love the barrier shut,<BR>
Made limn in picture, or in sculpture cut.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor he alone those virtuous dames, who, sage<BR>
And chaste, had so adorned antiquity,<BR>
Whose fame, preserved by the historic page,<BR>
Is never doomed its dying day to see;<BR>
But those as well that will in future age<BR>
Everywhere beautify fair Italy,<BR>
Made fashion in their well-known form and mien;<BR>
As eight that round this fount by thee are seen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What time the damsel ripe for husband shows,<BR>
So that the fruit may now be gathered, I<BR>
(Did chance or my misfortune so dispose?)<BR>
Am worthiest found; and those broad lands that lie<BR>
Without the walls which that fair town enclose,<BR>
&#8212;The fishy flat no less than upland dry&#8212;<BR>
Extending twenty miles about that water,<BR>
He gives me for a dowry, with his daughter.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She was so mannered, was so fair of hue,<BR>
None could desire she other gifts should bring;<BR>
So well to broider was she taught, and sew,<BR>
Minerva knew not better; did she sing,<BR>
Or play, or walk, to those that hear and view,<BR>
She seems a heavenly, and no mortal thing;<BR>
And in the liberal arts was skilled as well<BR>
As her own sire, or scarce behind him fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With genius high and beauty no less bright,<BR>
Which might have served the very stones to move,<BR>
Such love, such sweetness did the maid unite,<BR>
Thinking thereof meseems my heart is clove.<BR>
She had no greater pleasure or delight<BR>
Than being with me, did I rest or rove.<BR>
Twas long ere we had any strife; in fine<BR>
We quarrelled; and the fault, alas! was mine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Five years my consort&#8217;s father had been dead,<BR>
Since to that yoke I stooped, and pledged my vow;<BR>
When in short time (the manner shall be said)<BR>
Began the sorrows that I feel even now.<BR>
While me with all his pinions overspread<BR>
Love of the dame, whose praises thus I blow,<BR>
A noble townswoman with love of me<BR>
Was smit; more sorely smitten none could be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She, in all magic versed, was of such skill<BR>
As never was enchantress; by her say<BR>
Moved solid earth, and made the sun stand still,<BR>
Illumined gloomy night and darkened day:<BR>
Yet never could she work upon my will,<BR>
With salve I could not give, except with scathe<BR>
Of her to whom erewhile I pledged my faith.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not because she right gentle was and bright,<BR>
Nor because I believed her love so true,<BR>
Nor for large gift, nor promise often plight,<BR>
Nor yet because she never ceased to sue,<BR>
Could she from me obtain one spark of light<BR>
From that first flame my gentle consort blew:<BR>
So mates and masters every will in me<BR>
The knowledge of my wife&#8217;s fidelity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I in the hope, belief, and certitude<BR>
My wife to me was faithful evermore,<BR>
Should with contempt the beauty have eschewed<BR>
Of that famed daughter which fair Leda bore;<BR>
And all the wit and wealth wherewith was wooed<BR>
The illustrious shepherd upon Ida hoar.<BR>
But no repulse withal with her avails,<BR>
Who me, for ever at my side, assails.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;One day that me beyond my palace sees<BR>
That weird enchantress, who Melissa hight,<BR>
And where she can discourse with me at ease,<BR>
She finds a way whereby my peace to blight;<BR>
And, goading me with evil jealousies,<BR>
The faith I nursed at heart, she puts to flight.<BR>
She &#8217;gan commending my intent to be<BR>
Faithful to her who faithful was to me.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;But that she faithful is, ye cannot say,<BR>
Save of her faith ye have assurance true;<BR>
If she fails not withal, where fail she may,<BR>
She faithful, modest may be deemed by you:<BR>
But is she never from your side away,<BR>
Is not permitted other man to view,<BR>
How does this boldness come, that you would be<BR>
The warrant of her untried modesty?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Go forth awhile; go forth come from home alone;<BR>
And be the bruit in town and village spread<BR>
That she remains behind, and you are gone;<BR>
Let lovers and let couriers have their head:<BR>
If, unpersuaded still by prayer and boon,<BR>
She does no outrage to the marriage bed;<BR>
Though doing so she deem herself unseen,<BR>
Then faithful you the dame may justly ween.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I with such words and such-like words was plied,<BR>
Till so on me the shrewd enchantress wrought,<BR>
I wished to see my consort&#8217;s virtue tried<BR>
By certain proof, and to the touchstone brought.<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;Now grant we (I to that witch-lady cried)<BR>
She prove what cannot by myself be thought,<BR>
How by some certain token can I read<BR>
If she will merit punishment or meed?&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;A drinking-cup will I for that assay<BR>
Give you (she said) of virtue strange and rare:<BR>
Such was for Arthur made by Morgue the fay,<BR>
To make him of Genevra&#8217;s fault aware.<BR>
The chaste wife&#8217;s lord thereof may drink; but they<BR>
Drink not, whose wedded partners wanton are:<BR>
For, when they would the cordial beverage sup,<BR>
Into their bosom overflows the cup.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Below departing, you the test shall try,<BR>
And, to my thinking, now shall you drink clean;<BR>
For clean as yet I think your consort, I:<BR>
The event however shall by you be seen.<BR>
Yet will I warrant not your bosom dry,<BR>
Should you repeat the proof; for if, between<BR>
The cup and lip, the liquor be not shed,<BR>
You are the happiest wight that ever wed.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The offer I accept, the vase to me<BR>
Is given, and trial made with full success;<BR>
For hitherto (as hoped) confirmed I see<BR>
My gentle consort&#8217;s worth and faithfulness.<BR>
&#8216;Leave her awhile (Melissa said), and be<BR>
A month or twain a truant, more or less:<BR>
Then homeward wend; again the goblet fill;<BR>
And prove if you the beverage drink or spill.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I thought it hard to leave my consort&#8217;s side;<BR>
Not as so much about her truth in pain,<BR>
As that I could nor for two days abide,<BR>
Nay, not an hour without her could remain.<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;You in another way (Melissa cried)<BR>
Guided by me, the truth shall ascertain;<BR>
Voice, vesture shall you change; and to her sight<BR>
Present yourself, disguised like other wight.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sir, a fair city nigh at hand, defends<BR>
Twixt fierce and threatening horns the foaming Po;<BR>
Whose jurisdiction to the shore extends,<BR>
Where the sea&#8217;s briny waters come and go:<BR>
This yields in ancientry, but well contends<BR>
With neighbouring towns in rich and gorgeous show:<BR>
A Trojan remnant its foundations placed,<BR>
Which scaped from Attila&#8217;s destructive waste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A rich, a youthful, and a handsome knight<BR>
Bridles this city with his sovereign sway;<BR>
Who, following a lost falcon in its flight,<BR>
Entering by chance my dwelling on a day,<BR>
Beheld my wife, who pleased him so at sight,<BR>
He bore her impress in his heart away;<BR>
Nor ceased to practise on her, with intent<BR>
To incline the matron to his evil bent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So often she repels the cavalier<BR>
That finally his courtship is foregone;<BR>
But her fair image graved by Love will ne&#8217;er<BR>
Be razed from memory; me Melissa won<BR>
(So well she soothed and flattered) of that peer<BR>
The face and figure to the sight to don;<BR>
And changed me&#8212;nor well how can I declare&#8212;<BR>
In voice and visage and in eyes and hair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I, having to my lady made a show<BR>
As eastward bound and gone,&#8212;like him that wooed,<BR>
Her rich and youthful lover, altered so,<BR>
His semblance, attended by Melissa, go,<BR>
Into a page upon her side transmewed;<BR>
Who the most costly jewels with her bore<BR>
E&#8217;er brought form Ind, or Erithraean shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I enter safely, that my palace knew,<BR>
And with me wends Melissa; and there I<BR>
So wholly at her ease Madonna view,<BR>
No woman or attendant squire is by.<BR>
To her with suppliant prayer forthwith I sue,<BR>
And next those goads to evil deed apply;<BR>
Show emerald, ruby, diamond, that might serve;<BR>
To make the firmest heart from honour swerve;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And I declare to her the gift is small<BR>
To that, which she may hope to make her own;<BR>
Then of the vantage speak, that from his hall<BR>
Her husband at the present time is gone;<BR>
And I how long it was to her recall,<BR>
Since, as she knew, to her my love was shown;<BR>
And that my loving with such faith, in the end<BR>
Might worthily to some reward pretend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;At first she was somedeal disturbed; became<BR>
Like scarlet; nor would listen to my say;<BR>
But seeing those bright jewels flash like flame,<BR>
Her stubborn heart was softened, and gave way;<BR>
And in brief speech and feeble said the dame<BR>
What to remember takes my life away:<BR>
She with my wishes, said, she would comply,<BR>
If sure to be unseen of watchful eye.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Me my wife&#8217;s words like poisoned weapon thrill,<BR>
And pierce my suffering spirit through and through:<BR>
Through bones and veins there went a deadly chill;<BR>
My tongue clave to my throat: The witch withdrew<BR>
With that the magic mantle, and at will<BR>
Transformed me to mine ancient shape anew.<BR>
&#8212;Bethink thee of what hue my wife became,<BR>
Taken by me in such notorious shame!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of deadly hue we both of us remain;<BR>
We both stand silent; both with downcast eye.<BR>
So feeble is my tongue, that I with pain,<BR>
So faint my voice, that I with pain can cry;<BR>
&#8216;Thou wouldst betray me then, O wife, for gain,<BR>
If there was one that would my honour buy!&#8217;<BR>
She nought replies; nor save by tears she speaks,<BR>
Which furrow, as they fall, her woeful cheeks.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Shame stings her sore, but yet in sorer wise<BR>
Wrath at the outrage I to her had done;<BR>
And so without restraint it multiplies,<BR>
And into rage and cruel hate is run,<BR>
To fly from me forthwith does she devise;<BR>
And, what time from his car dismounts the sun,<BR>
Runs to the shore, aboard her pinnace wends,<BR>
And all that night the stream in haste descends;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And she at morn presents herself before<BR>
Him that had loved her once, the cavalier,<BR>
Whose semblance and whose borrowed face I wore<BR>
When, to my shame, I tempted her whilere.<BR>
To him that loved, and loves her evermore,<BR>
Her coming, it may be believed, is dear.<BR>
From thence she bade me never entertain<BR>
The hope she&#8217;d love me or be mine again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alas! with him she swells in mickle glee<BR>
Even from that day, and makes of me a jest;<BR>
And of that evil which I brought on me<BR>
I languish yet, and find no place of rest.<BR>
Justly this growing ill my death will be,<BR>
Of little remnant now of life possest.<BR>
I well believe I in a year had died,<BR>
But that a single comfort aid supplied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That comfort was; of all which harboured were<BR>
Here for ten years (for still to every guest<BR>
Beneath my roof I bade the vessel bear)<BR>
Was none but with the wine had bathed his breast.<BR>
To have so many comrades in my care,<BR>
Some little soothes the griefs that so molest.<BR>
Thou only of so many hast been wise,<BR>
Who wouldst forbear the perilous emprize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My wish, o&#8217;erpassing every fitting bound,<BR>
To know what husband of his wife should know,<BR>
Is cause, by me no quiet will be found,<BR>
Whether my death be speedy of be slow.<BR>
Thereat at first Melissa joys; but drowned<BR>
Forthwith is her light mirth; for of my woe<BR>
Esteeming her the cause, that dame so sore<BR>
I hated, I would not behold her more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Impatient to be treated with disdain<BR>
By me,&#8212;of her more loved than life, she said -<BR>
Where she forthwith as mistress to remain<BR>
Had hoped, when thence the other was conveyed,<BR>
&#8212;Not to behold such present, cause of pain,<BR>
Her own departure little she delayed;<BR>
And went so far away, no further word<BR>
By me was ever of that woman heard.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
His tale the mournful cavalier so taught;<BR>
And when he now had closed his history,<BR>
With pity touched, somewhile immersed in thought<BR>
Rinaldo mused, and after made reply:<BR>
&#8220;Right ill advice to thee Melissa brought,<BR>
Who moved three thus to anger wasps; and I<BR>
Perceive in thee small wisdom, that wouldst sound<BR>
A thing which thou wouldst gladly not have found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If she, thy wife, by avarice was inclined<BR>
To break her faith and be to thee untrue,<BR>
Muse not: nor first nor last of womankind,<BR>
She, worsted, from such cruel war withdrew;<BR>
And by a meaner bribe yet firmer mind<BR>
Is even tempted fouler deed to do.<BR>
Of men, of how many we hear, that sold<BR>
Their patrons and their friends for sordid gold?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With such fierce arms thou ill didst her assail,<BR>
If to behold a brave defence thou sought.<BR>
Knowst thou not, against gold of no avail<BR>
Is stone, or steel to hardest temper wrought?<BR>
Meseems that thou in tempting her didst fail<BR>
More than herself, that was so quickly caught.<BR>
I know not, had she tempted thee as much,<BR>
If thou, thyself, hadst better stood the touch.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Here ends Rinaldo, and&#8212;the parley done&#8212;<BR>
Rises and to his rest desires to go:<BR>
Awhile will he repose; and then be gone,<BR>
An hour or two before the daylight show.<BR>
But little time has Aymon&#8217;s warlike son;<BR>
Nor idly will that little time bestow.<BR>
To him the mansion&#8217;s master made reply,<BR>
He in his house might at his pleasure lie.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
For bed and bower, within, were ready dight;<BR>
But&#8212;would he take his counsel for his guide&#8212;<BR>
In comfort might he sleep throughout the night.<BR>
And yet advance some miles; &#8220;For thou,&#8221; he cried,<BR>
&#8220;Shalt have a pinnace, that with rapid flight<BR>
And without risque shall with the current glide.<BR>
Therein shalt thou all night pursue thy way,<BR>
And on thy journey gain withal a day.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Good seemed that proffer in Rinaldo&#8217;s eyes,<BR>
And to the courteous host large thanks he paid;<BR>
Then for the pinnace which that lord supplies,<BR>
That waits him with her crew, the warrior made.<BR>
Here, at full ease reclined, Rinaldo lies,<BR>
While with the stream his frigate is conveyed;<BR>
Which, by six oars impelled, flies fast and fair,<BR>
And cleaves the water, as a bird the air.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
As soon as he reclines his weary head,<BR>
Asleep is Mount Albano&#8217;s cavalier;<BR>
Having erewhile that they shall wake him, said,<BR>
As soon as they Ferrara&#8217;s city near.<BR>
Melara lies left of that river&#8217;s bed,<BR>
Sermide to the right; they in their rear<BR>
Next leave Stellata and Figarolo,<BR>
Where his two horns are lowered by angry Po.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Of those two horns that which t&#8217;ward Venice goes<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s pilot left, and took the right;<BR>
Then the Bodeno past. Already shows<BR>
Faintly the eastern blue, and fades from sight;<BR>
For now Aurora from her basket throws<BR>
All her rich flowers, and paints it red and white;<BR>
When viewing the two castles of Tealdo,<BR>
Again his head uplifts the good Rinaldo.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O happy town! whereof&#8221; (the warrior cried)<BR>
&#8220;Spake Malagigi, having, far and near,<BR>
The fixt and wandering fires of heaven espied,<BR>
And forced some subject spirit to appear,<BR>
To me foretelling that in future tide,<BR>
&#8212;What time with him I took his way whilere&#8212;<BR>
Even to such pitch thy glorious fame should rise,<BR>
Thou from all Italy wouldst bear the prize.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
So saying, in his barge he all this while<BR>
Hurries, as if the bark with pinions flew,<BR>
Scowering the king of rivers, to that isle<BR>
Nearest the town; and, though it not to view<BR>
(Deserted and neglected then) doth smile,<BR>
This yet rejoices to behold anew;<BR>
Nor makes small mirth thereat; because aware<BR>
Hereafter how adorned &#8217;twill be and fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Before when he with him that way had gone,<BR>
From Malagigi, his cousin, did he hear<BR>
That when seven hundred times his course had run,<BR>
Circling the heaven in Aries, the fourth sphere,<BR>
Of islands this should be the fairest one<BR>
In sea, or pool, or river, far and near,<BR>
So that who this beheld, would brook no more<BR>
To hear that praised which fair Nausicaa bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
He heard, it in fair mansions would outdo<BR>
That island which Tiberius held so dear;<BR>
And trees that in Hesperian gardens grew<BR>
Would yield to what this beauteous place should bear;<BR>
&#8212;So rare its race of beasts&#8212;no fairer shew<BR>
Herded or housed erewhile by Circe were;<BR>
Venus with Loves and Graces there should sport,<BR>
Nor more in Gnide and Cyprus keep her court;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
And so would flourish through his study and care,<BR>
Who will with knowledge and with power should blend;<BR>
And who so safely should that bright repair<BR>
With circling wall and sheltering dyke defend,<BR>
The united world&#8217;s assault it well might dare,<BR>
Nor call on foreign power its aid to lend;<BR>
And that Duke Hercules&#8217; sire and Hercules&#8217; son<BR>
Was he by whom this marvel should be done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
So wends the warrior summing in his mind<BR>
What erst to him had told his cousin wise;<BR>
What time the sage of future things divined,<BR>
Whereof with him he often wont devize;<BR>
And aye contemplating that city blind,<BR>
&#8220;How can it ever be,&#8221; Rinaldo cries,<BR>
&#8220;That in all liberal and all worthy arts<BR>
Shall flourish so these waste and watery parts?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And that to city of such amplitude<BR>
And beauty such a petty burgh should grow,<BR>
And where but marsh and miry pool is viewed,<BR>
Henceforth should full and fruitful harvests glow?<BR>
Even now I rise, to hail the gentle blood,<BR>
The love, the courtesy thy lords shall show,<BR>
O thou fair city, in succeeding years;<BR>
Thy burghers&#8217; honours and thy cavaliers&#8217;.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The grace ineffable of powers above,<BR>
Thy princes&#8217; wisdom and their love of right,<BR>
Shall with perpetual peace, perpetual love<BR>
Preserve thee in abundance and delight;<BR>
And a defence from all the fury prove<BR>
Of such as hate thee; and unmask their spite.<BR>
Be thy content thy neighbours&#8217; wide annoy,<BR>
Rather than thou shouldst envy other&#8217;s joy!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
While thus Rinaldo speaks, so swiftly borne<BR>
By the quick current flies that nimble yawl;<BR>
Not to the lure more swiftly makes return<BR>
The falcon, hurrying at his lord&#8217;s recall.<BR>
Thenceforth the right-hand branch of the right horn<BR>
Rinaldo takes; and hid are roof and wall:<BR>
St. George recedes; recede from that swift boat<BR>
The turrets OF GAIBANA and OF THE MOAT.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Montalban&#8217;s martial lord (as it befell,<BR>
That thought moved thought, which others moved again)<BR>
In memory chances on the knight to dwell,<BR>
That him at supper late did entertain;<BR>
That, through this city&#8217;s cause, the truth to tell,<BR>
Hath reason evermore to be in pain;<BR>
And of the magic vessel him bethinks<BR>
Which shows his consort&#8217;s guilt to him that drinks;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
And him bethinks therewith of what the knight<BR>
Related; how of all that he had tried,<BR>
Who of his goblet drank, there was no wight<BR>
But split the wine he to his lips would guide.<BR>
Now he repents him; now, &#8220;&#8217;Tis my delight,&#8221;<BR>
(Mutters) &#8220;that I the proof would not abide:<BR>
Succeeding I should prove but what I thought;<BR>
And not succeeding, to what pass am brought!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This my belief I deem a certainty;<BR>
And faith could have but small increase in me:<BR>
So, if I this should by the touchstone try,<BR>
My present good would little bettered be:<BR>
But small the evil would not prove, if I<BR>
Saw of my Clarice what I would not see.<BR>
This were a thousand against one to stake;<BR>
To hazard much where I could nothing take.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
The knight of Clermont buried in this mood,<BR>
Who lifted not his visage from the floor,<BR>
A mariner with much attention viewed,<BR>
That overright was seated at his oar;<BR>
And, for he deemed he fully understood<BR>
The thought that prest the cavalier so sore,<BR>
Made him (well-spoken was the man and bold)<BR>
Wake from his muse, some talk with him to hold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
The substance of the talk between the two<BR>
Was, that the husband little wit possest,<BR>
Who, wishing to assay if she was true,<BR>
Had tried his wife by too severe a test:<BR>
For woman, proof to gold and silver, who,<BR>
Armed but with modesty, defends her breast,<BR>
This from a thousand faulchions will defend<BR>
More surely, and through burning fires will wend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
The mariner subjoined: &#8220;Thou saidest well;<BR>
With gifts so rich he should not her have prest;<BR>
For, these assaults, these charges, to repel,<BR>
Not good alike is every human breast.<BR>
I know not if of wife thou has heard tell<BR>
(For haply not with us the tale may rest)<BR>
That in the very sin her husband spied,<BR>
For which she by his sentence should have died.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My lord should have remembered, gold and meed<BR>
Have upon every hardest matter wrought:<BR>
But he forgot this truth in time of need;<BR>
And so upon his head this ruin brought,<BR>
Ah! would that he in proof, like me, a deed<BR>
Done in this neighbouring city had been taught,<BR>
His country and mine own; which lake and fen,<BR>
Brimming with Mincius&#8217; prisoned waters, pen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I of Adonio speak, that in a hound<BR>
A treasure on the judge&#8217;s wife conferred.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;Thereof,&#8221; replied the paladin, &#8220;the sound<BR>
Hath not o&#8217;erpast the Alps; for never word<BR>
Of this neighbouring France, nor in my round<BR>
Through far and foreign countries have I heard:<BR>
So tell, if telling irks not,&#8221; said the peer,<BR>
&#8220;What willingly I bown myself to hear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
The boatman then: &#8220;Erewhile was of this town<BR>
One Anselm, that of worthy lineage came;<BR>
A wight that spent his youth in flowing gown,<BR>
Studying his Ulpian: he of honest fame,<BR>
Beauty, and state assorting with his own,<BR>
A consort sought, and one of noble name:<BR>
Nor vainly; in a neighbouring city, crowned<BR>
With superhuman beauty, one he found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She such fair manners and so graceful shows,<BR>
She seems all love and beauty; and much more<BR>
Perchance than maketh for her lord&#8217;s repose;<BR>
Then well befits the reverend charge he bore.<BR>
He, wedded, strait in jealousy outgoes<BR>
All jealous men that ever were before:<BR>
Yet she affords not other cause for care<BR>
But that she is too witty and too fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In the same city dwelt a cavalier,<BR>
Numbered that old and honoured race among,<BR>
Sprung from the haughty lineage, which whilere<BR>
Out of the jaw-bone of a serpent sprung:<BR>
Whence Manto, doomed my native walls to rear,<BR>
Descended, and with her a kindred throng.<BR>
The cavalier (Adonio was he named)<BR>
Was with the beauties of the dame inflamed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And for the furtherance of his amorous quest,<BR>
To grace himself, began his wealth to spend,<BR>
Without restraint, in banquet and in vest,<BR>
And what might most a cavalier commend:<BR>
If he Tiberius&#8217; treasure had possest,<BR>
He of his riches would have made an end.<BR>
I well believe two winters were not done,<BR>
Ere his paternal fortune was outrun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The house erewhile, frequented by a horde<BR>
&#8212;Morning and evening&#8212;of so many friends,<BR>
Is solitary; since no more his board<BR>
Beneath the partridge, quail, and pheasant bends.<BR>
Of that once noble troop upon the lord,<BR>
Save beggars, hardly any one attends.<BR>
Ruined, at length he thinks he will begone<BR>
To other country, where he is unknown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He leaves his native land with this intent,<BR>
Nor letteth any his departure know;<BR>
And coasts, in tears and making sad lament,<BR>
The marshes that about his city go:<BR>
He his heart&#8217;s queen, amid his discontent,<BR>
Meanwhile forgets not, for this second woe.<BR>
Lo! him another accident that falls,<BR>
From sovereign woe to sovereign bliss recalls!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He saw a peasant who with heavy stake<BR>
Smote mid some sapling trunks on every side:<BR>
Adonio stopt, and wherefore so he strake,<BR>
Asked of the rustic, that in answer cried,<BR>
Within that clump a passing ancient snake,<BR>
Amid the tangled stems he had espied:<BR>
A longer serpent and more thick to view<BR>
He never saw, nor thought to see anew;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And that from thence he would not wend his way<BR>
Until the reptile he had found and slain,<BR>
When so Adonio heard the peasant say,<BR>
He scarce his speech with patience could sustain,<BR>
Aye reverence to the serpent wont to pay,<BR>
The honoured ensign of his ancient strain;<BR>
In memory that their primal race had grown<BR>
Erewhile from serpent&#8217;s teeth by Cadmus sown;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And by the churl the offended knight so said,<BR>
And did withal, he made him quit the emprize;<BR>
Leaving the hunted serpent neither dead,<BR>
Nor injured, nor pursued in further wise.<BR>
Thither, where he believes would least have spread<BR>
The story of his woe, Adonio hies;<BR>
And in discomfort and in sorrow wears,<BR>
Far from his native land, seven weary years.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Neither for distance nor for straitened cheer,<BR>
Which will not let Thought run its restless round,<BR>
Ceased Love, so wont to rein the cavalier,<BR>
Aye to inflame his heart, aye vex his wound:<BR>
At length those beauties, to his eyes so dear,<BR>
Parforce must he revisit, homeward bound.<BR>
Unshorn, afflicted, he, in poor array,<BR>
Thither returns, from whence he went his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My city, at the time whereof I tell,<BR>
To Rome was fain to send an embassy;<BR>
That sometime near his holiness should dwell;<BR>
And for how long a time could none foresee.<BR>
Upon our judge the lot of envoy fell:<BR>
O day, that ever wept by him will be!<BR>
To be excused, Anselmo promised, prayed,<BR>
And bribed; but at the last parforce obeyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As no less cruel and less hard to abide<BR>
He deemed a woe which caused such piteous smart,<BR>
Than had he seen a hostile hand his side<BR>
Lay bare, and from his bosom pluck his heart:<BR>
Dead-white with jealous fear his cheek is dyed,<BR>
Through doubt of his fair consort while apart;<BR>
And in the mode he deems may best avail,<BR>
He supplicates her not in faith to fail,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor beauty, to his wife the husband cries,<BR>
Nor noble blood, nor fortune, are enow<BR>
To make a woman to true honour rise,<BR>
Save chaste in name and deed; subjoining how<BR>
The virtue that mankind most highly prize<BR>
Is that which triumphs after strife; and now<BR>
Through his long absense, a fair field and wide<BR>
Is opened where that virtue may be tried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With such persuasions, and with many more<BR>
Anselm exhorts the lady to be true.<BR>
His going doth his woful wife deplore.<BR>
O heaven, what tears, what loud complaints ensue!<BR>
Immersed in her despair, that lady swore,<BR>
Sooner the sun bedimmed the world should view<BR>
Than she would break her faith; she would expire<BR>
Sooner than she would cherish such desire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Though to the lady&#8217;s promise and protest<BR>
He lent belief, and somewhat calmed his fears,<BR>
Until he further hear he will not rest;<BR>
And till he can find matter for his tears,<BR>
A soothsayer he among his friends possest,<BR>
Prized for his knowledge, as the first of seers;<BR>
Who of all witchery and of magic art<BR>
Had read the whole, or read the greater part.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To him before departing does he pray,<BR>
To take the charge upon himself to see<BR>
If true would be Argia while away<BR>
(So name his consort), or the contrary.<BR>
Won by his prayers, he takes the time o&#8217; the day;<BR>
Figures the heavens as they appear to be.<BR>
Anselmo left him at his work, and came<BR>
His answer on the following day to claim.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The astrologer is silent, loath to expose<BR>
A matter that will work the doctor woe;<BR>
And would excuse himself with many a gloze:<BR>
But when he sees, he would the evil know,<BR>
Argia will break faith with him, he shows,<BR>
As soon as he shall from his threshold go.<BR>
Nor prayer shall soften her, nor beauty fire:<BR>
Corrupted will she be by gain and hire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When to Anselmo&#8217;s early doubt and fear<BR>
Are joined the threatnings of the signs above,<BR>
How stands his heart may well to thee appear,<BR>
If thou hast known the accidents of love;<BR>
And worse than every woe, wherewith whilere<BR>
The afflicted spirits of that husband strove,<BR>
Is that it by the prophet is foretold,<BR>
Argais&#8217; honour will be bought and sold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Now to support his wife, as best he may,<BR>
From falling into such an evil deed.<BR>
For man, alas, will sometimes disarray<BR>
The altar, when he finds himself in need,<BR>
What gold and gems the judge had put away,<BR>
(A plenteous store) he leaves; and field and mead,<BR>
Rents, fruits, and all possessions whatsoe&#8217;er<BR>
Leaves to his consort; all his worldly gear:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;With power,&#8217; he said, &#8216;not only without measure,<BR>
These, as thou needest, to enjoy and spend,<BR>
But do with them according to thy pleasure,<BR>
Consume and fling away, and give and vend:<BR>
Other account I ask not of my treasure,<BR>
If such as now I find thee in the end;<BR>
But such as now remain;&#8212;at thy command<BR>
(Even shouldst thou squander both) are house and land.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Unless she heard he thither made repair,<BR>
He prayed that she would dwell not in the town;<BR>
But would a farm of his inhabit, where<BR>
She might with all convenience live alone.<BR>
And this besought he of his consort fair,<BR>
As thinking, that the rustics, which on down<BR>
Pasture their flocks, or fruitful fallows till,<BR>
Could ne&#8217;er contaminate her honest will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her fearful husband still embracing close,<BR>
Her arms about his neck Argia threw:<BR>
A burst of tears her visage overflows:<BR>
For from her eyes two streams their way pursue.<BR>
She grieves, he guilty should his wife suppose;<BR>
As if she hath already been untrue:<BR>
For his suspicion to its source she traced;<BR>
That in her faith no faith Anselmo placed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Citing their long farewell, I should exceed.<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;To thee at length,&#8217; he so the dame addrest,<BR>
&#8216;I recommend my honour&#8217;;&#8212;and indeed<BR>
Took leave, and on his road in earnest prest;<BR>
And truly felt, on wheeling round his steed,<BR>
As if his heart was issuing from his breast.<BR>
She follows him as long as she can follow<BR>
With eyes whose tears her furrowed visage hollow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Poor, pale, unshorn, and wretched (as whilere<BR>
To you in former strain by me was said),<BR>
Homeward meanwhile the wandering cavalier,<BR>
Hoping he there should be unknown, had made.<BR>
Beside the lake that pilgrim journeyed, near<BR>
The city, where he gave the serpent aid,<BR>
In that thick brake besieged by village swain,<BR>
Who with his staff the reptile would have slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Arriving here, upon the dawn of light,<BR>
For yet some stars were glimmering in the skies,<BR>
Approaching him, in foreign vesture dight,<BR>
Along the shore, a damsel he espies.<BR>
Though neither squire nor waiting wench in sight<BR>
Appears, yet noble is the lady&#8217;s guise.<BR>
With pleasing visage she Adonio boards,<BR>
And then breaks silence in the following words.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Albeit thou know&#8217;st me not, O cavalier<BR>
I am thy kin, and greatly bound to thee:<BR>
I am thy kin; for of the lineage clear<BR>
Derived of haughty Cadmus&#8217; seed are we.<BR>
I am the fairy Manto, that whilere<BR>
Laid the first stone of this rude villagery;<BR>
And (as thou haply mayst have heard it famed)<BR>
Mantua from me the rising town was named.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;O&#8217; the fairies am I one: with that to show<BR>
Our fatal state, and what it doth import;<BR>
We to all other kinds of ill below<BR>
Are subject by our natal influence, short<BR>
Of death; but with immortal being such woe<BR>
Is coupled, death is not of direr sort.<BR>
For every seventh day we all must take<BR>
By certain law, the form of spotted snake.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;So sad it is that loathsome coil to fill,<BR>
And prone, at length, upon the ground to crawl;<BR>
Equal to this here is no worldly ill;<BR>
So that immortal life is cursed by all.<BR>
And thou the debt I owe thee (for my will<BR>
Is to inform thee of its cause withal)<BR>
Shalt know as well; how on that fatal day<BR>
Of change we are to countless ills a prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;So hated as the serpent beast is none;<BR>
And we that wear its evil form, alarm,<BR>
Outrage, and war endure from every one:<BR>
For all that see us, hunt and do us harm:<BR>
Unless we can to ground for shelter run,<BR>
We feel how heavy falls man&#8217;s furious arm.<BR>
Happier it were to die, than languish&#8212;broke,<BR>
Battered, and crippled by the cruel stroke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;My mighty obligation due to thee<BR>
Is that, when once thou didst this greenwood thread,<BR>
Thou from a rustic&#8217;s fury rescuedst me,<BR>
By whose ill handling was I sore bested.<BR>
But for thine aid, I should not have got free,<BR>
Without a broken spine or battered head:<BR>
With body crooked and crushed I should have lain,<BR>
Albeit I could not by his arm be slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Because thou hast to know upon the day<BR>
We sprang from earth with scales of dragon dight,<BR>
&#8212;Subject to us at other times&#8212;to obey<BR>
The heavens refuse; and we are void of might:<BR>
At other seasons, at our simple say<BR>
The circling sun stands still, and dims its light:<BR>
Fixt earth is moved, and in a circle wheels:<BR>
Ice at our word takes fire, and fire congeals.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Now here, prepared to render thee the meed<BR>
Of benefit then done to me, I stand;<BR>
For now, dismantled of my dragon weed,<BR>
Vainly no grace of me wilt thou demand.<BR>
Even now, thrice richer art thou by my deed,<BR>
Than when thou heirdst erewhile thy father&#8217;s land:<BR>
Now will I that henceforth thou shalt be poor;<BR>
But wealth, the more &#8217;tis spent, augment the more:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And because with that ancient knot thou still,<BR>
I know, art tangled, which by Love was tied,<BR>
The mode and order, how thou mayst fulfil<BR>
Thy wishes, shall by me be signified.<BR>
Now that her lord is absent, &#8217;tis my will<BR>
My scheme without delay by thee be tried;<BR>
Go forth the lady at her farm to find,<BR>
Without the town; nor will I say behind.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She her discourse continuing, &#8217;gan advise<BR>
What form he to that lady&#8217;s eyes should take:<BR>
I say, what vesture wear, and in what wise<BR>
Should speak, how tempt her; what entreaties make:<BR>
And said, how she her figure would disguise;<BR>
For, save the day wherein she was a snake,<BR>
Upon all others went the fairy drest<BR>
In whatsoever figure pleased her best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She in a pilgrim&#8217;s habit clothed the knight,<BR>
Such as from door to door our alms entreat:<BR>
Into a dog she changed herself to sight;<BR>
The smallest ever seen, of aspect sweet,<BR>
Long hair, than ermine&#8217;s fur more snowy white;<BR>
And skilled withal in many a wondrous feat.<BR>
Towards Agria&#8217;s villa, so transmewed,<BR>
The fairy and the knight their way pursued;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And at the labourer&#8217;s cabins in his round<BR>
The stripling halts, before he stops elsewhere;<BR>
And certain rustic reeds begins to sound;<BR>
His dog is up, and dances to the air.<BR>
The dame, that hears the voice and cry rebound,<BR>
Is by the rumour moved to see the pair.<BR>
Into her court she has the pilgrim brought,<BR>
As Anselm&#8217;s evil destiny had wrought:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And here Adonio gives the dog command;<BR>
And here by that obedient dog is shown<BR>
Dance of our country and of foreign land,<BR>
With paces, graces, fashions of his own;<BR>
And finally he does, amid that band,<BR>
With winning ways what else is to be done,<BR>
With such attention of the admiring crew,<BR>
None winked their eyes, their breath they scarcely drew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Great marvel in the dame, then longing, bred<BR>
That gentle dog: she one that her had nursed<BR>
With no mean offer to his master sped.<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;If all the riches for which women thirst&#8217;<BR>
(To her embassadress in answer said<BR>
The wary pilgrim) &#8216;in my bags were pursued,<BR>
There is not in that treasure what would boot<BR>
To purchase of my dog one single foot&#8217;:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And he, the truth of his discourse to show,<BR>
Into a corner took the beldam old,<BR>
And bade the dog in courtesy bestow<BR>
Upon that messanger a mark of gold.<BR>
The dog obeyed, and shook himself; and lo!<BR>
The treasure! which he bade her have and hold:<BR>
Thereto he added, &#8216;Thinkest thou by ought<BR>
A dog so fair and useful can be bought?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;For whatsoever I of him demand,<BR>
I empty-handed never go away;<BR>
Now pearl, now ring will he shake from him, and<BR>
Now gift me with some rich and fair array.<BR>
Yet tell madonna he is at her command;<BR>
But not for gold; for him no gold can pay;<BR>
But if I for one night her arms may fill,<BR>
Him may she take and do with him her will.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So said, a gem, new-dropt, on her he prest,<BR>
And bade her to the lady bear the boon.<BR>
That in the costly produce she possest<BR>
Ten, twenty ducats&#8217; value deemed the crone.<BR>
She bore the message to the dame addressed,<BR>
And after wrought on her till she was won<BR>
To buy the beauteous dog, who might be bought<BR>
By payment of a prize which costeth nought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Argia somewhat coy at first appears;<BR>
Partly that she her faith will not forego;<BR>
Partly that she believes not all she hears<BR>
That beldam of the dog and pilgrim show.<BR>
The nurse insists, and dins into her ears,<BR>
That seldom such a chance occurs below;<BR>
And makes her fix another day to see<BR>
That dog, when fewer eyes on her shall be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The next appearance which Adonio made<BR>
Was ruin to the doctor; for the hound<BR>
Doubloons, by dozens and by dozens, braid<BR>
Of pearl, and costly jewels scattered round.<BR>
So that Argia&#8217;s pride of heart was laid;<BR>
And so much less the dame maintained her ground,<BR>
When she in him, who made the proffer, viewed<BR>
The Mantuan cavalier that whilom wooed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The harlot nurse&#8217;s evil oratory,<BR>
The prayer and presence of the suitor lord,<BR>
The occasion to acquire that mighty fee,<BR>
Which wretched Anselm&#8217;s absence would afford,<BR>
The hope that none would her accuser be,<BR>
So vanquish her chaste thoughts, she makes the accord&#8212;<BR>
Accepts the wondrous dog; and, as his pay,<BR>
To her leman yields herself a willing prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
The fruits of love long culled that cavalier<BR>
With his lady fair; unto whom the fay<BR>
Took such affection, whom she held so dear,<BR>
That she obliged herself with her to stay.<BR>
Through all the signs the sun had travelled, ere<BR>
The judge had leave to wend his homeward way.<BR>
He finally returned; but sore afraid<BR>
Through what the astrologer erewhile had said.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Arrived, his first employment is to run<BR>
To that astrologer&#8217;s abode, and crave,<BR>
If shame and evil to his wife be done;<BR>
Of if she yet her faith and honor save.<BR>
The heavens he figured; and to every one<BR>
Of the seven planets its due station gave;<BR>
Then to the judge replied that it had been<BR>
Even as he feared, and as it was foreseen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By richest presents tempted to forego<BR>
Her faith, a prey was she to other wight.<BR>
This to the doctor&#8217;s heart was such a blow;<BR>
Nor lance, nor spear, I deem, so sorely smite.<BR>
To be more certified he wends (although<BR>
He is too well assured the seer is right)<BR>
To that old nurse; and, drawing her apart,<BR>
To learn the truth employs his every art.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He in wide circles doth about her wind,<BR>
Hoping now here, now there, to spy some trace:<BR>
But nought in the beginning can he find,<BR>
With whatsoever care he sifts the case.<BR>
For she, as not unpractised in that kind,<BR>
Denies, and fronts him with untroubled face;<BR>
And, as well taught, above a month stands out,<BR>
Holding the judge &#8217;twixt certainty and doubt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;How blest would doubt appear, had he that wound<BR>
Foreseen, which would be given by certainty!<BR>
When out of that false nurse at last he found<BR>
He could not fish the truth by prayer or fee,<BR>
Touching no chord but yielded a false sound,<BR>
He shrewdly waits his time till there should be<BR>
Discord between the beldam and his wife:<BR>
For whereso women are, is stir and strife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And even that Anselmo waited, so<BR>
Befell; since, angered by the first despite,<BR>
Unsought of him, to him that nurse did go,<BR>
To tell the whole; and nothing hid from sight.<BR>
How sank his heart beneath that cruel blow,<BR>
&#8217;Twere long to say; how prostrate lay his sprite.<BR>
So was the wretched judge with grief opprest,<BR>
He of his wits well-nigh was dispossest;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And finally resolved to die, so burned<BR>
His rage, but first would kill the faithless dame;<BR>
And he with one destructive faulchion yearned<BR>
To free himself from woe and her from shame.<BR>
Stung by such blind and furious thoughts, returned<BR>
Anselmo to the city, in a flame;<BR>
And to the farm despatched a follower true,<BR>
Charged with the bidding he was bound to do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He bids the servant to the villa go,<BR>
And to Argia in his name pretend,<BR>
He by a fever is reduced so low,<BR>
She hardly can arrive before his end.<BR>
Hence without waiting escort&#8212;would she show<BR>
Her love&#8212;she with his man must backward wend,<BR>
(Wend with him will she surely, nor delay)<BR>
And bids him cut her throat upon the way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The serving man to call his lady went<BR>
Prepared his lord&#8217;s command on her to do.<BR>
Having her little dog at starting hent,<BR>
She mounted and began her journey, through<BR>
The dog advised of Anselm&#8217;s ill intent,<BR>
But bid no less her purpose to pursue;<BR>
For he had taken thought for her; and aid<BR>
Should in the time of peril be purveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The servant from his pathway turns aside,<BR>
And through bye-roads and solitary goes;<BR>
Purposely lighting on a stream, whose tide<BR>
From Apennine into our river flows;<BR>
Where, both of farm and busy city wide,<BR>
A holt, and dark and dismal greenwood grows.<BR>
Silent appeared the gloomy place, and one<BR>
Fitting the cruel deed which should be done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He drew his sword on her, and signified<BR>
The mandate by her angry husband given;<BR>
That so she might entreat, before she died,<BR>
Forgiveness of her every sin from Heaven.<BR>
I know not how; she vanished from his side,<BR>
When through her flank the blade he would have driven.<BR>
Vainly long time he seeks her, then remains<BR>
Foiled and outscorned, for guerdon of his pains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He all astound and with bewildered face,<BR>
And full of shame, to seek his lord returns;<BR>
Who from the servant that unwonted case,<BR>
Unweeting how the thing had happened, learns;<BR>
Nor knows the fairy Manto fills a place<BR>
About Argia, prompt to serve her turns.<BR>
Because the nurse, that all the rest revealed<BR>
(I know not wherefore, I), had this concealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He knows not what to do: the outrage sore<BR>
Avenged he has not, nor his pain allaid:<BR>
What was a mote is now a beam; so sore<BR>
It prest him; on his heart so heavy weighed.<BR>
So plain is what was little known before,<BR>
He fears that it will shortly be displaid.<BR>
At first, he haply might have hid his woe;<BR>
Which Rumour now throughout the world will blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Full well he wots, that since his evil vein<BR>
He to his wife, unhappy wretch! hath shown,<BR>
Not to be subject to his yoke again,<BR>
She to some strong protector will have flown;<BR>
Who to his ignominy will maintain,<BR>
And utter scorn, the lady as his own:<BR>
And haply may she to some losel flee,<BR>
Who will her paramour and pander be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For remedy, he sends in haste a band<BR>
Of messengers, with letters far and nigh.<BR>
Some of Argia here, some there demand;<BR>
Nor town unsearched is left in Lombardy.<BR>
Next he in person goes; nor any land<BR>
Leaves unexamined by himself or spy.<BR>
Yet cannot he discover means or way<BR>
For learning where concealed his consort lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The servant last he called on whom was laid<BR>
The ill hest, but who had served not his despite;<BR>
And thither by his guidance was conveyed,<BR>
Where (as &#8217;twas said) she vanished from his sight;<BR>
Who haply lurked by day in greenwood-shade,<BR>
And to some friendly roof retired at night.<BR>
He thither guided, where but forest-trees<BR>
He thinks to find, a sumptuous palace sees.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This while for bright Argia in that part<BR>
The fay had made with speedy toil prepare<BR>
An alabaster palace by her art,<BR>
Gilded within, without, and everywhere.<BR>
So wonderful, no tongue could tell, no heart<BR>
Conceive, how rich within, without how fair:<BR>
That, which thou deemed so fair, my master&#8217;s home,<BR>
Is but a cottage to that costly dome.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Curtain and cloth of arras deck the wall,<BR>
Sumptuously woven and in different wise,<BR>
In vaulted cellar and in littered stall;<BR>
Not only spread in latticed galleries,<BR>
Not only spread in lordly bower and hall.<BR>
Vase, gold and silver, gems of many dyes,<BR>
Carved into cup and charger, blue, red, green,<BR>
And countless cloths of silk and gold are seen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He chanced upon the costly dome (as I<BR>
To you was in my story making known)<BR>
When he expected not a hut to spy,<BR>
And but a weary waste of woodland lone.<BR>
As he beheld the dome with wondering eye,<BR>
Anselmo thought his intellects were gone:<BR>
That he was drunk, or dreamed that wondrous sight<BR>
He weened, of that his wits had taken flight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;An Aethiop woman posted at the door,<BR>
With blubber lip and nostril, he descries.<BR>
Nor will he see again, nor e&#8217;er before<BR>
Had seen a visage of such loathsome guise:<BR>
Ill-favoured&#8212;such was Aesop feigned of yore:<BR>
If there, she would have saddened Paradise.<BR>
Greasy and foul and beggarly her vest;<BR>
Nor half her hideousness have I exprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Anselm, who saw no other wight beside<BR>
To tell who was that mansion&#8217;s lord, drew nigh<BR>
To the Aethiopian, and to her applied;<BR>
And she: &#8216;The owner of this house am I.&#8217;<BR>
The judge was well assured the negress lied,<BR>
And made that answer but in mockery:<BR>
But with repeated oaths the negress swears;<BR>
&#8217;Tis hers, and none with her the mansions shares;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And would he see the palace, him invites<BR>
To view it at his ease; and recommends<BR>
If there be ought within which him delights,<BR>
To take it for himself or for his friends.<BR>
Anselmo hears, and from his horse alights,<BR>
Gives it his man; and o&#8217;er the threshold wends;<BR>
And by the hag conducted, mounts from hall<BR>
Below to bower above, admiring all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Form, site, and sumptuous work doth he behold,<BR>
And royal ornament and fair device;<BR>
And oft repeats, not all this wide world&#8217;s gold<BR>
To buy the egregious mansion wound suffice.<BR>
To him in answer said that negress old:<BR>
&#8216;And yet this dome, like others, hath its prize;<BR>
If not in gold and silver, price less high<BR>
Than gold and silver will the palace buy&#8217;:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And she to him prefers the same request,<BR>
Which erst Adonio to Argia made.<BR>
A fool he deemed the woman and possest,<BR>
Who for a boon so foul and filthy prayed.<BR>
Yet ceased she not, though more than thrice represt;<BR>
And strove so well Anselmo to persuade,<BR>
Proffering, for his reward, the palace still,<BR>
She wrought on him to do her evil will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The wife Argia, that is hid fast by,<BR>
When in such sin her husband she descries,<BR>
Of doctor, that was deemed so passing wise,<BR>
Springs forth and saith: &#8216;Ah! worthy deed! which I<BR>
Found in such foul and filthy work, espy!&#8217;<BR>
Bethink thee, if his kindling blushes rise;<BR>
If he stands mute! why opens not thy hollow<BR>
And central womb, O earth, the wretch to swallow?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To clear herself and shame him, doth she stun<BR>
Anselmo, never ceasing to upbraid.<BR>
&#8216;What pain should by thyself be undergone<BR>
For this so filthy deed, (Argia said)<BR>
If thou would&#8217;st take my life for having done<BR>
What Nature prompted and a lover prayed;<BR>
One that was fair and gentle, and who brought<BR>
A gift, compared wherewith, this dome is nought?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;If worthy of one death thou deemest me,<BR>
Worthy art thou a hundred deaths to die:<BR>
And, though my pleasure might I do on thee,<BR>
So passing puissant in this place am I,<BR>
No other or worse vengeance done shall be<BR>
Upon my side, on thy delinquency.<BR>
The give against the take, O husband, place;<BR>
And, as &#8217;twas granted thee, so grant me grace:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And be there peace between us, and accord<BR>
That all be to forgetfulness consigned;<BR>
Nor thee I of thy fault by deed or word,<BR>
Nor me of mine, henceforward thou remind!&#8217;<BR>
This seemed a goodly bargain to her lord;<BR>
Nor to such pardon was he disinclined.<BR>
Thus peace and concord they at home restore,<BR>
And love each other dearly evermore.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIV.</TD><TD>
So said the mariner, and some brief fit<BR>
Of laughter in Montalban&#8217;s master stirred;<BR>
And made his visage burn, as if &#8217;twas lit<BR>
With fire, when of Anselmo&#8217;s shame he heard.<BR>
Rinaldo greatly praised Argia&#8217;s wit,<BR>
Who by such quaint device had trapped that bird;<BR>
Who fell into the net wherein the dame<BR>
Herself erewhile had fallen, but with less shame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLV.</TD><TD>
When the sun climbed a steeper road, the knight<BR>
Ordered the board with food to be supplied,<BR>
Which the good Mantuan landlord overnight<BR>
Took care with largest plenty to provide;<BR>
While the fair town, upon the left, from sight<BR>
Retired, and on the right that marish wide.<BR>
Argenta is come and gone, with circling walls<BR>
And stream into whose bed Santerno falls.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLVI.</TD><TD>
Then was not fair Bastia built, deem I,<BR>
Which little cause of boast affords to Spain<BR>
(That there her banner has been raised on high),<BR>
And causes deeper sorrow to Romagne.<BR>
Thence in strait line their bark, that seems to fly,<BR>
To the right shore the boatmen drive amain:<BR>
Next through a stagnant channel make, that near<BR>
Ravenna brings by noon the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLVII.</TD><TD>
Though oft of money he had small supply,<BR>
Then was the knight so well bested, he made<BR>
The weary rowers, in his courtesy,<BR>
A parting present, ere farewell was said.<BR>
Here changing horse and guide, to Rimini<BR>
Rinaldo rode that very eye, nor stayed<BR>
In Montefiore till the night was done;<BR>
And well nigh reached Urbino with the sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLVIII.</TD><TD>
Then Frederick was not there of gentle lore,<BR>
Nor was Elizabeth nor Guido good;<BR>
Francis Maria nor sage Leonore;<BR>
Who would in courteous, not in haughty mood,<BR>
Have forced so famed a paladin for more<BR>
Than one short eye, with them to make abode;<BR>
As they long did, and do unto this day,<BR>
By dames and cavaliers who pass that way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIX.</TD><TD>
Since here none takes his rein, Rinaldo bends<BR>
His course an-end to Cagli; o&#8217;er the height,<BR>
Rifted by Gaurus and Metaurus, wends<BR>
Past Apennine, no longer on his right,<BR>
Umbri and Tuscans; and at Rome descends.<BR>
From Rome to Ostia goes Montalban&#8217;s knight:<BR>
Thence to the city sails; wherein a grave<BR>
His pious son to old Anchises gave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CL.</TD><TD>
There changes back; and thence in haste he goes<BR>
Bound towards Lampedosa&#8217;s island-shore,<BR>
That place of combat chosen by the foes,<BR>
And where they had encountered Frank and Moor.<BR>
Rinaldo grants his boatmen no repose;<BR>
That do what can be done by sail and oar.<BR>
But with ill wind and strong the warrior strives;<BR>
And, though by little, there too late arrives.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLI.</TD><TD>
Thither he came what time Anglante&#8217;s peer<BR>
The useful and the glorious deed had done;<BR>
Had slain those paynim kings in the career,<BR>
But had a hard and bloody conquest won:<BR>
Dead was Sir Brandimart; and Olivier,<BR>
Dangerously hurt and sore, sate woe-begone,<BR>
Somedeal apart, upon the sandy ground,<BR>
Martyred and crippled by his cruel wound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLII.</TD><TD>
From tears could not the mournful Count refrain,<BR>
When brave Rinaldo he embraced, and said,<BR>
How in the battle Brandimart was slain.<BR>
Such love, such faith endeared the warrior dead.<BR>
Nor less Rinaldo&#8217;s tears his visage stain<BR>
When he so cleft beholds their comrade&#8217;s head.<BR>
Thence to embrace bold Oliviero, where<BR>
He sits with wounded foot, he makes repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLIII.</TD><TD>
All comfort that he could he gave; though none<BR>
Could good Rinaldo to himself afford;<BR>
Because he came but when the feast was done;<BR>
Yea after the removal of the board.<BR>
The servants wend to the demolished town,<BR>
There hide the bones of either paynim lord<BR>
Beneath Biserta&#8217;s ruined domes, and nigh<BR>
And far, the fearful tidings certify.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLIV.</TD><TD>
At the fair conquest won by Roland&#8217;s blade,<BR>
Sansonet and Astolpho make great cheer;<BR>
Yet other mirth whose warriors would have made<BR>
Had Brandimart not perished; when they hear<BR>
That he is dead, their joy is so allayed<BR>
They can no more the troubled visage clear.<BR>
Which of them now the tidings of such woe<BR>
To the unhappy Flordelice shall show?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLV.</TD><TD>
The night preceding that ill-omened day<BR>
Flordelice dreamed the vest of sable grain<BR>
That she had made, her husband to array,<BR>
And woven with her hand and worked with pain,<BR>
Before her eyes all sprinkled-over lay<BR>
With ruddy drops, in guise of pattering rain.<BR>
That she had worked it so the lady thought;<BR>
And then was grieved at seeing what was wrought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLVI.</TD><TD>
And seemed to say, &#8220;Yet from my lord have I<BR>
Command to make it all of sable hue;<BR>
Now wherefore it is stained with other dye<BR>
Against his will, in mode so strange to view?&#8221;<BR>
She from that dream draws evil augury;<BR>
And thither on that eve the tidings flew:<BR>
But these concealed Astolpho from the dame<BR>
Till he to her with Sansonetto came.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLVII.</TD><TD>
When they are entered, and she sees no show<BR>
Of joyful triumphs, she, without a word,<BR>
Without a hint to indicate that woe,<BR>
Knows that no longer living is her lord.<BR>
With that her gentle heart was riven so,<BR>
And so her harassed eyes the light abhorred,<BR>
And so was every other sense astound,<BR>
That, like one dead, she sank upon the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLVIII.</TD><TD>
She in her hair, when life returns again,<BR>
Fastens her hand; and on her lovely cheeks,<BR>
Repeating the beloved name in vain,<BR>
With all her force her scorn and fury wreaks;<BR>
Uproots and tears, her locks, and in her pain<BR>
Like woman, smit by evil demon, shrieks,<BR>
Or, as Bacchante at the horn&#8217;s rude sound,<BR>
Erewhile was seen to run her restless round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLIX.</TD><TD>
Now to the one, to the other now her prayer<BR>
She made for knife, wherewith her heart to smite;<BR>
Now she aboard the pinnace would repair<BR>
That brought the corse of either paynim knight,<BR>
And would on either, lifeless as they were,<BR>
Do cruel scathe, and vent her fierce despite.<BR>
Now would she seek her lord, till at his side<BR>
She rested from her weary search, and died.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! wherefore, Brandimart, did I let thee<BR>
Without me wend on such a dire emprize?<BR>
She ne&#8217;er before did thy departure see,<BR>
But Flordelice aye followed thee,&#8221; she cries:<BR>
&#8220;Well aided mightest thou have been by me;<BR>
For I on thee should still have kept my eyes;<BR>
And when Gradasso came behind thee, I<BR>
Thee might have succoured with a single cry;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And haply I so nimbly might have made<BR>
Between you, that the stroke I might have caught,<BR>
And with my head, as with a buckler, stayed:<BR>
For little ill my dying would have wrought.<BR>
Anyhow I shall die; and&#8212;that debt paid&#8212;<BR>
My melancholy death will profit nought:<BR>
When, had I died, defending thee in strife,<BR>
I could not better have bestowed my life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Even is averse had been hard Destiny,<BR>
And all heaven&#8217;s host, when thee I sought to aid,<BR>
At least my tears had bathed thy visage, I<BR>
Should the last kiss thereon, at least, have laid;<BR>
And, ere amid the blessed hierarchy<BR>
Thy spirit mixt, &#8216;Depart&#8217;&#8212;I should have said&#8212;<BR>
&#8216;In peace, and wait me in thy rest; for there,<BR>
Where&#8217;er thou art, I swiftly shall repair.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Is this, O Brandimart, is this the reign,<BR>
Whose honoured sceptre thou wast now to take?<BR>
With thee to Dommogire, thy fair domain,<BR>
Thus went I; me thus welcome dost thou make?<BR>
Alas! what hope to-day thou renderest vain!<BR>
Ah! what designs, fell Fortune, dost thou break!<BR>
Ah! wherefore fear I, since a lot so blest,<BR>
Is lost, to lose as well the worthless rest?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXIV.</TD><TD>
Repeating this and other plaint, so spite<BR>
And fury waxed, that she in her despair<BR>
Made new assault upon her tresses bright,<BR>
As if the fault was wholly in her hair:<BR>
Wildly her hands together doth she smite,<BR>
And gnaw; with nails her lip and bosom tear.<BR>
But I return to Roland and his peers;<BR>
While she bemoans herself and melts in tears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXV.</TD><TD>
Roland with Olivier, who much requires<BR>
Such leech&#8217;s care, his anguish to allay;<BR>
And who, himself, some worthy place desires<BR>
As much, wherein Sir Brandimart to lay,<BR>
Steers for the lofty mountain, that with fires<BR>
Brightens the night, with smoke obscures the day.<BR>
The wind blows fair, and on the starboard hand,<BR>
Not widely distant from them, lies that land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXVI.</TD><TD>
With a fresh wind, that in their favour blows,<BR>
They loose their hawser at the close of day:<BR>
In heaven above the silent goddess shows<BR>
Her shining horn, to guide them on their way;<BR>
And on the following morn before them rose<BR>
The pleasant shores that round Girgenti lay.<BR>
Here Roland orders for the ensuing night<BR>
All that is needful for the funeral rite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXVII.</TD><TD>
He, when he saw his order duly done,<BR>
And now the westering sun&#8217;s fair light was spent.<BR>
With many nobles, who from neighbouring town,<BR>
At his invital, to Girgenti went,<BR>
&#8212;The shore with torches blazing up and down,<BR>
And sounding wide with cries and loud lament,&#8212;<BR>
Thither returned where late, of life bereft,<BR>
His friends, beloved in life and death, was left.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXVIII.</TD><TD>
There stands Bardino, weeping o&#8217;er the bier,<BR>
Who under Age&#8217;s heavy burden bows;<BR>
Who, in the tears on shipboard shed whilere.<BR>
Might well have wept away his eyes and brows:<BR>
Upbraiding skies and stars, the cavalier,<BR>
Like lion, in whose veins a fever glows,<BR>
Roars as he wreathes his wayward hands within<BR>
His hoary hair, and rends his wrinkled skin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXIX.</TD><TD>
Upon the paladin&#8217;s return the cry<BR>
Redoubled, and the mourning louder grew<BR>
Orlando to the corse approached more nigh,<BR>
And speechless stood awhile, his friends to view,<BR>
Pale, as at eve is the acanthus&#8217; dye<BR>
Or lily&#8217;s, which were plucked at morn: he drew<BR>
A heavy sigh, and on the warrior dead<BR>
Fixing his stedfast eyes, the County said:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O comrade bold and true, there here liest slain,<BR>
And who dost live in heaven above, I know,<BR>
Rewarded with a life, thy glorious gain,<BR>
Which neither heat nor cold can take, my woe<BR>
Forgive, if thou beholdest me complain:<BR>
Because I sorrow to remain below,<BR>
And not to share in such delights with thee;<BR>
Not that thou art not left behind with me.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alone, without thee, there is nought I may<BR>
Ever possess, without thee, that can please.<BR>
If still with thee in tempest and affray,<BR>
Ah wherefore not with thee in calm and ease?<BR>
Right sore must be my trespass, since this clay<BR>
Will not to follow thee my soul release.<BR>
If in thy troubles still I bore a burden,<BR>
Why am I not a partner of thy guerdon?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thine is the guerdon; mine the loss; thy gain<BR>
Is single; but not single is my woe:<BR>
Partners with me in sorrow are Almayne,<BR>
And grieving France and Italy; and oh!<BR>
How will my lord and uncle, Charlemagne,<BR>
How will his paladins lament the blow!<BR>
How will the Christian church and empire moan,<BR>
Whose best defence in thee is overthrown!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Oh! how thy foes will by the death of thee<BR>
Be freed henceforward from alarm and fear!<BR>
Alas! how strengthened paynimry will be!<BR>
What hardiment will now be theirs! what cheer!<BR>
What of thy consort will become? I see<BR>
Even here her mourning, and her outcries hear.<BR>
Me she accuses, haply hates, I know;<BR>
In that, through me, her every hope lies low.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet by one comfort, Flordelice, is followed<BR>
His loss, for us that reft of him remain:<BR>
His death, with such surpassing glory hallowed,<BR>
To die all living warriors should be fain.<BR>
Those Decii; Curtius, in Rome&#8217;s forum swallowed;<BR>
Cordus, so vaunted by the Grecian train;<BR>
Not with more honour to themselves, with more<BR>
Profit to others, went to death of yore.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXV.</TD><TD>
These sad laments and more Orlando made;<BR>
And all this while white friars, and black, and gray,<BR>
With other clerks, by two and two arrayed,<BR>
Behind in long procession took their way;<BR>
And they to God for the departed prayed,<BR>
That he would to his rest his soul convey.<BR>
Before and all about were torches reared,<BR>
And changed to day the sable night appeared.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXVI.</TD><TD>
They raise the warrior&#8217;s bier, and ranged to bear<BR>
By turns that honoured weight were earl and knight.<BR>
The pall was purple silk, with broidery rare<BR>
Of gold, and pearls in costly circles dight.<BR>
Thereon, of lordly work and no less fair,<BR>
Cushions were laid, with jewels shining bright.<BR>
On which was stretched the lifeless knight in view,<BR>
Arrayed in vest of like device and hue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXVII.</TD><TD>
A hundred men had past before the rest,<BR>
All taken from the poorest of the town;<BR>
And in one fashion equally were drest<BR>
Those beadsmen all, in black and trailing gown.<BR>
A hundred pages followed them, who prest<BR>
A hundred puissant steeds, for warfare bown;<BR>
And by those pages backed, the portly steeds<BR>
Went, sweeping wide the ground with sable weeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Banners in front and banners borne in rear,<BR>
Whose fields with diverse ensignry is stained,<BR>
Unfurled accompany the funeral bier;<BR>
Which from a thousand vanquished bands were gained,<BR>
For Caesar and for Peter&#8217;s church whilere,<BR>
By that rare force, which now extinct remained.<BR>
Bucklers by other followers carried are,<BR>
Won from good warriors, whose device they bear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXIX.</TD><TD>
By hundreds and by hundreds followed more,<BR>
Ordained for different tasks, the steps of those;<BR>
Who burning torches like those others bore.<BR>
Mantled, say rather closely muffled, goes<BR>
Roland in sables next, and evermore<BR>
His eyes suffused and red with weeping shows.<BR>
Nor wears a gladder face Montalban&#8217;s peer.<BR>
At home his wound detains Sir Olivier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXX.</TD><TD>
The ceremonies would be long to say<BR>
In verse, wherewith Sir Brandimart was mourned;<BR>
The mantles, black or purple, given away;<BR>
The many torches which that eve were burned.<BR>
Wending to the cathedral, where the array<BR>
Past on its road, were no dry eyes discerned:<BR>
All sexes, ages, ranks, in pitying mood<BR>
Gazed upon him so youthful, fair, and good.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXI.</TD><TD>
He in the church was placed; and, when with vain<BR>
Lament the women had bemoaned the dead,<BR>
And Kyrie Eleison, by the priestly train,<BR>
And other holy orisons were said,<BR>
In a fair ark, upraised on columns twain,<BR>
Was reared, with sumptuous cloth of gold o&#8217;erspread.<BR>
So willed Orlando; till he could be laid<BR>
In sepulchre of costlier matter made:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXII.</TD><TD>
Nor out of Sicily the Count departs,<BR>
Till porphyries he procures and alabasters,<BR>
And fair designs; and in their several arts<BR>
Has with large hire engaged the primest masters.<BR>
Next Flordelice, arriving in those parts,<BR>
Raises the quarried slabs and rich pilasters;<BR>
Who, good Orlando being gone before,<BR>
Is hither wafted from the Africk shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXIII.</TD><TD>
She, seeing that her tears unceasing flow,<BR>
And that of long lament she never tires;<BR>
Nor she, for mass or service said, her woe<BR>
Can ease, or satisfy her sad desires,<BR>
Vows in her heart she thence will never go<BR>
Till from the wearied corse her soul expires;<BR>
And builds in that fair sepulchre a cell;<BR>
There shuts herself; therein for life will dwell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Thither in person, having courier sent<BR>
And letter, Roland goes, her thence to take;<BR>
Her, would she wend to France, with goodly rent<BR>
Would gift, and Galerana&#8217;s inmate make;<BR>
As far as Lizza convoy her, if bent<BR>
On journeying to her father; for her sake<BR>
If wholly she to serve her God was willed,<BR>
A monastery would the warrior build.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXV.</TD><TD>
Still in that sepulchre she dwelt, and worn<BR>
By weary penance, praying night and day,<BR>
It was not long, ere by the Parcae shorn<BR>
Was her life&#8217;s thread: already on their way<BR>
Were the three Christian warriors, homeward borne,<BR>
Sorrowing and afflicted sore in mind<BR>
For their fourth comrade who remained behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXVI.</TD><TD>
They would not go without a leech, whose skill<BR>
Might ease the wound of warlike Olivier;<BR>
Which, as in the beginning it could ill<BR>
Be salved, is hard to heal. Meanwhile they hear<BR>
The champion so complain, his outcries fill<BR>
Orlando and all that company with fear.<BR>
While they discoursed thereon, the skipper, moved<BR>
By a new notion, said what all approved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXVII.</TD><TD>
A hermit not far distance hence, he said<BR>
A lonely rock inhabits in this sea;<BR>
Whose isle none, seeking succour, vainly tread,<BR>
Whether for counsel or for aid it be:<BR>
Who hath done superhuman deeds; the dead<BR>
Restores to life; and makes the blind to see;<BR>
Hushes the winds; and with a sign o&#8217; the cross<BR>
Lulls the loud billows when they highest toss;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
And adds they need not doubt, if they will go<BR>
To seek that holy man to God so dear,<BR>
But he on Olivier will health bestow;<BR>
Having his virtue proved by signs more clear.<BR>
This counsel pleases good Orlando so,<BR>
That for the holy place he bids him steer;<BR>
Who never swerving from his course, espies<BR>
The lonely rock, upon Aurora&#8217;s rise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Worked by good mariners, the bark was laid<BR>
Safely beside the rugged rock and fell:<BR>
The marquis there, with crew and servants&#8217; aid,<BR>
They lowered into their boat; and through the swell<BR>
And foaming waters in that shallop made<BR>
For the rude isle; thence sought the holy cell;<BR>
The holy cell of that same hermit hoar,<BR>
By whom Rogero was baptized before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXC.</TD><TD>
The servant of the Lord of Paradise<BR>
Receives Orlando and the rest on land;<BR>
Blesses the company in cheerful wise;<BR>
And after of their errand makes demand;<BR>
Though he already had received advice<BR>
From angels of the coming of that band.<BR>
That they were thither bound in search of aid<BR>
For Oliviero&#8217;s hurt, Orlando said;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCI.</TD><TD>
Who, warring for the Christian faith, in fight<BR>
To perilous pass was brought by evil wound.<BR>
All dismal fear relieved that eremite,<BR>
And promised he would make him wholly sound.<BR>
In that no unguents hath the holy wight,<BR>
Nor is in other human medicine found,<BR>
His church he seeks, his knee to Jesus bows,<BR>
And issues from the fane with cheerful brows;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCII.</TD><TD>
And in the name of those eternal Three,<BR>
The Father, and the Son, and Holy Ghost,<BR>
On Oliviero bade his blessing be.<BR>
Oh! grace vouchsafed to faith! his sainted host<BR>
From every pain the paladin did free;<BR>
And to his foot restored its vigour lost.<BR>
He moved more nimble than before, and sure;<BR>
And present was Sobrino at the cure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCIII.</TD><TD>
Sobrino, so diseased that he described<BR>
How worse with each succeeding day he grew,<BR>
As soon as he that holy monk espied<BR>
The manifest and mighty marvel do,<BR>
Disposed himself to cast Mahound aside,<BR>
And own in Christ a living God and true.<BR>
He, full of faith, with contrite heart demands<BR>
Our holy rite of baptism at his hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCIV.</TD><TD>
So him baptized the hermit; and as well<BR>
That monarch made as vigorous as whilere.<BR>
At this conversion no less gladness fell<BR>
On Roland and each Christian cavalier,<BR>
Than when, restored from deadly wound, and well<BR>
The friendly troop beheld Sir Olivier.<BR>
Rogero more rejoiced than all that crew;<BR>
And still in faith and grace the warrior grew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCV.</TD><TD>
Rogero from the day he swam ashore<BR>
Upon that islet, there had ever been.<BR>
That band is counselled by the hermit hoar,<BR>
Who stands, benign, those warlike knights between,<BR>
Eschewing in their passage mire and moor,<BR>
To wade withal through that dead water, clean,<BR>
Which men call life; wherein so fools delight;<BR>
And evermore on heaven to fix their sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCVI.</TD><TD>
Roland on shipboard sends one from his throng,<BR>
Who fetches hence good wine, hams, cheese, and bread;<BR>
And makes the sage, who had forgotten long<BR>
All taste of partridge since on fruits he fed,<BR>
Even do for love, what others did, among<BR>
Those social guests for whom the board was spread.<BR>
They, when their strength by food was reinforced,<BR>
Of many things amid themselves discoursed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCVII.</TD><TD>
And as in talk it often doth befall<BR>
That one thing from another takes its rise,<BR>
Roland and Olivier Rogero call<BR>
To mind for that Rogero, in such wise<BR>
Renowned in arms; whose valour is of all<BR>
Lauded and echoed with accordant cries.<BR>
Not even had Rinaldo known the knight<BR>
For him whose prowess he had proved in fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCVIII.</TD><TD>
Him well Sobrino recognized whilere,<BR>
As soon as with that aged man espied;<BR>
But he at first kept silence; for in fear<BR>
Of some mistake the monarch&#8217;s tongue was tied.<BR>
But when those others knew the cavalier<BR>
For that Rogero, famous far and wide,<BR>
Whose courtesy, whose might and daring through<BR>
The universal world loud Rumor blew,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCIX.</TD><TD>
All, for they know he is a Christian, stand<BR>
About him with serene and joyful face:<BR>
All press upon the knight; one grasps his hand;<BR>
Another locks him fast in his embrace:<BR>
Yet more than all the others of that band<BR>
Him would Montalban&#8217;s lord caress and grace:<BR>
Why more than all the others will appear<BR>
In other strain, if you that strain will hear.</TD></TR>
