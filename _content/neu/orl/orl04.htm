<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
The old Atlantes suffers fatal wreck,<BR>
Foiled by the ring, and young Rogero freed,<BR>
Who soars in air till he appears a speck,<BR>
Mounted upon the wizard&#8217;s winged steed.<BR>
Obediant to the royal Charles&#8217;s beck,<BR>
He who had followed Love&#8217;s imperious lead,<BR>
Rinaldo, disembarks on British land,<BR>
And saves Geneura, doomed to stake and brand.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Though an ill mind appear in simulation,<BR>
And, for the most, such quality offends;<BR>
&#8217;Tis plain that this in many a situation<BR>
Is found to further beneficial ends,<BR>
And save from blame, and danger, and vexation;<BR>
Since we converse not always with our friends,<BR>
In this, less clear than clouded, mortal life,<BR>
Beset with snares, and full of envious strife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
If after painful proof we scarcely find<BR>
A real friend, through various chances sought,<BR>
To whom we may communicate our mind,<BR>
Keeping no watch upon our wandering thought;<BR>
What should the young Rogero&#8217;s lady kind<BR>
Do with Brunello, not sincere, but fraught<BR>
With treasons manifold, and false and tainted,<BR>
As by the good enchantress truly painted?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
She feigns as well with that deceitful scout;<BR>
(Fitting with him the father of all lies)<BR>
Watches his thievish hands in fear and doubt;<BR>
And follows every motion with her eyes.<BR>
When lo! a mighty noise is heard without!<BR>
&#8220;O mighty mother! king of heaven!&#8221; she cries,<BR>
&#8220;What thing is this I hear?&#8221; and quickly springs<BR>
Towards the place from whence the larum rings,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
And sees the host and all his family,<BR>
Where, one to door, and one to window slips,<BR>
With eyes upturned and gazing at the sky,<BR>
As if to witness comet or eclipse.<BR>
And there the lady views, with wondering eye,<BR>
What she had scarce believed from other&#8217;s lips,<BR>
A feathered courser, sailing through the rack,<BR>
Who bore an armed knight upon his back.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Broad were his pinions, and of various hue;<BR>
Seated between, a knight the saddle pressed,<BR>
Clad in steel arms, which wide their radiance threw,<BR>
His wonderous course directed to the west:<BR>
There dropt among the mountains lost to view.<BR>
And this was, as that host informed his guest,<BR>
(And true the tale) a sorcerer, who made<BR>
Now farther, now more near, his frequent raid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, sometimes towering, soars into the skies;<BR>
Then seems, descending, but to skim the ground:<BR>
And of all beauteous women makes a prize,<BR>
Who, to their mischief, in these parts are found.<BR>
Hence, whether in their own or other&#8217;s eyes,<BR>
Esteemed as fair, the wretched damsels round,<BR>
(And all in fact the felon plunders) hide;<BR>
As fearing of the sun to be descried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A castle on the Pyrenean height<BR>
The necromancer keeps, the work of spell.&#8221;<BR>
(The host relates) &#8220;of steel, so fair and bright,<BR>
All nature cannot match the wonderous shell.<BR>
There many cavaliers, to prove their might,<BR>
Have gone, but none returned the tale to tell.<BR>
So that I doubt, fair sir, the thief enthralls<BR>
Or slays whoever in the encounter falls.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
The watchful maid attends to every thing,<BR>
Glad at her heart, and trusting to complete<BR>
(What she shall compass by the virtuous ring)<BR>
The downfall of the enchanter and his seat.<BR>
Then to the host&#8212;&#8220;A guide I pray thee bring,<BR>
Who better knows than me the thief&#8217;s retreat.<BR>
So burns my heart, (nor can I choose but go)<BR>
To strive in battle with this wizard foe.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;It shall not need,&#8221; exclaimed the dwarfish Moor,<BR>
&#8220;For I, myself, will serve you as a guide;<BR>
Who have the road set down, with other lore,<BR>
So that you shall rejoice with me to ride.&#8221;<BR>
He meant the ring, but further hint forbore;<BR>
Lest dearly he the avowed should abide.<BR>
And she to him&#8212;&#8220;Your guidance gives me pleasure.&#8221;<BR>
Meaning by this she hoped to win his treasure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
What useful was to say, she said, and what<BR>
Might hurt her with the Saracen, concealed.<BR>
Well suited to her ends, the host had got<BR>
A palfrey, fitting for the road or field.<BR>
She bought the steed, and as Aurora shot<BR>
Her rosy rays, rode forth with spear and shield:<BR>
And maid and courier through a valley wind,<BR>
Brunello now before and now behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
From wood to wood, from mount to mountain hoar,<BR>
They clomb a summit, which in cloudless sky<BR>
Discovers France and Spain, and either shore.<BR>
As from a peak of Apennine the eye<BR>
May Tuscan and Sclavonian sea explore,<BR>
There, whence we journey to Camaldoli.<BR>
Then through a rugged path and painful wended,<BR>
Which thence into a lowly vale descended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
A rock from that deep valley&#8217;s centre springs;<BR>
Bright walls of steel about its summit go:<BR>
And this as high that airy summit flings,<BR>
As it leaves all the neighbouring cliffs below.<BR>
He may not scale the height who has not wings,<BR>
And vainly would each painful toil bestow.<BR>
&#8220;Lo! where his prisoners!&#8221; Sir Brunello cries,<BR>
&#8220;Ladies and cavaliers, the enchanter sties.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Scarped smooth upon four parts, the mountain bare<BR>
Seemed fashioned with the plumb, by builder&#8217;s skill<BR>
Nor upon any side was path or stair,<BR>
Which furnished man the means to climb the hill.<BR>
The castle seemed the very nest and lair<BR>
Of animal, supplied with plume and quill.<BR>
And here the damsel knows &#8217;tis time to slay<BR>
The wily dwarf, and take the ring away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
But deems it foul, with blood of man to stain<BR>
Unarmed and of so base a sort, her brand;<BR>
For well, without his death, she may obtain<BR>
The costly ring; and so suspends her hand.<BR>
Brunello, off his guard, with little pain,<BR>
She seized, and strongly bound with girding band:<BR>
Then to a lofty fir made fast the string;<BR>
But from his finger first withdrew the ring.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Neither by tears, nor groans, nor sound of woe,<BR>
To move the stedfast maid the dwarf had power:<BR>
She down the rugged hill descended slow,<BR>
Until she reached the plain beneath the tower.<BR>
Then gave her bugle breath, the keep below,<BR>
To call the castled wizard to the stower:<BR>
And when the sound was finished, threatening cried,<BR>
And called him to the combat and defied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Not long within his gate the enchanter stayed,<BR>
After he heard the voice and bugle ring.<BR>
Against the foe, who seemed a man, arrayed<BR>
In arms, with him the horse is on the wing.<BR>
But his appearance well consoled the maid,<BR>
Who, with small cause for fear, beheld him bring<BR>
Nor mace, nor rested lance, nor bitting sword,<BR>
Wherewith the corselet might be bruised or gored.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
On his left arm alone his shield he took,<BR>
Covered all o&#8217;er with silk of crimson hue;<BR>
In his right-hand he held an open book,<BR>
Whence, as the enchanter read, strange wonder grew:<BR>
For often times, to sight, the lance he shook;<BR>
And flinching eyelids could not hide the view;<BR>
With tuck or mace he seemed to smite the foe:<BR>
But sate aloof and had not struck a blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
No empty fiction wrought by magic lore,<BR>
But natural was the steed the wizard pressed;<BR>
For him a filly to griffin bore;<BR>
Hight hippogryph. In wings and beak and crest,<BR>
Formed like his sire, as in the feet before;<BR>
But like the mare, his dam, in all the rest.<BR>
Such on Riph&aelig;an hills, though rarely found,<BR>
Are bred, beyond the frozen ocean&#8217;s bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair,<BR>
The wizard thought but how to tame the foal;<BR>
And, in a month, instructed him to bear<BR>
Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal;<BR>
And execute on earth or in mid air,<BR>
All shifts of manege, course and caracole;<BR>
He with such labour wrought. This only real,<BR>
Where all the rest was hollow and ideal.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
This truth by him with fictions was combined,<BR>
Whose sleight passed red for yellow, black for white:<BR>
But all his vain enchantments could not blind<BR>
The maid, whose virtuous ring assured her sight:<BR>
Yet she her blows discharges at the wind;<BR>
And spurring here and there prolongs the fight.<BR>
So drove or wheeled her steed, and smote at nought,<BR>
And practised all she had before been taught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
When she sometime had fought upon her horse,<BR>
She from the courser on her feet descends:<BR>
To compass and more freely put in force,<BR>
As by the enchantress schooled, her wily ends.<BR>
The wizard, to display his last resource,<BR>
Unweeting the defence, towards her wends.<BR>
He bares the shield, secure to blind his foe,<BR>
And by the magic light, astonished, throw.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
The shield might have been shown at first, nor he<BR>
Needed to keep the cavaliers at bay;<BR>
But that he loved some master-stroke to see,<BR>
Achieved by lance or sword in single fray.<BR>
As with the captive mouse, in sportive glee,<BR>
The wily cat is sometimes seen to play;<BR>
Till waxing wroth, or weary of her prize,<BR>
She bites, and at a snap the prisoner dies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
To cat and mouse, in battles fought before,<BR>
I liken the magician and his foes;<BR>
But the comparison holds good no more:<BR>
For, with the ring, the maid against him goes;<BR>
Firm and attentive still, and watching sore,<BR>
Lest upon her the wizard should impose:<BR>
And as she sees him bare the wondrous shield,<BR>
Closes her eyes and falls upon the field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Not that the shining metal could offend,<BR>
As wont those others, from its cover freed;<BR>
But so the damsel did, to make descend<BR>
The vain enchanter from his wondrous steed.<BR>
Nor was in ought defeated of her end;<BR>
For she no sooner on the grassy mead<BR>
Had laid her head, than wheeling widely round,<BR>
The flying courser pitched upon the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Already cased again, the shield was hung,<BR>
By the magician, at his sadle bow.<BR>
He lights and seeks her, who like wolf among<BR>
The bushes, couched in thicket, waits the roe;<BR>
She without more delay from ambush sprung,<BR>
As he drew near, and grappled fast the foe.<BR>
That wretched man, the volume by whose aid<BR>
He all his battles fought, on earth had laid:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
And ran to bind her with a chain, which he,<BR>
Girt round about him for such a purpose, wore;<BR>
Because he deemed she was no less to be<BR>
Mastered and bound than those subdued before.<BR>
Him hath the dame already flung; by me<BR>
Excused with reason, if he strove not more.<BR>
For fearful were the odds between that bold<BR>
And puissant maid, and warrior weak and old!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Intending to behead the fallen foe,<BR>
She lifts her conquering hand; but in mid space,<BR>
When she beholds his visage, stops the blow,<BR>
As if disdaining a revenge so base.<BR>
She sees in him, her prowess has laid low,<BR>
A venerable sire, with sorrowing face;<BR>
Whose hair and wrinkles speak him, to her guess,<BR>
Of years six score and ten, or little less.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Kill me, for love of God!&#8221; (afflicted sore,<BR>
The old enchanter full of wrath did cry).<BR>
But the victorious damsel was not more<BR>
Averse to kill, than he was bent to die.<BR>
To know who was the necromancer hoar<BR>
The gentle lady had desire, and why<BR>
The tower he in that savage place designed,<BR>
Doing such outrage foul to all mankind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor I, by malice moved, alas! poor wight,&#8221;<BR>
(The weeping necromancer answer made,)<BR>
&#8220;Built the fair castle on the rocky height,<BR>
Nor yet for rapine ply the robber&#8217;s trade;<BR>
But only to redeem a gentle knight<BR>
From danger sore and death, by love was swayed;<BR>
Who, as the skies foreshow, in little season,<BR>
Is doomed to die a christian, and by treason.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The sun beholds not &#8217;twixt the poles, a Child<BR>
So excellent as him, and passing fair;<BR>
Who from his infancy, Rogero styled,<BR>
(Atlantes I) was tutored by my care.<BR>
By love of fame and evil stars beguiled,<BR>
He follows into France Troyano&#8217;s heir.<BR>
Him, in my eyes, than son esteemed more dear,<BR>
I seek to snatch from France and peril near.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I only built the beauteous keep to be<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s dungeon, safely harboured there;<BR>
Who whilom was subdued in fight by me,<BR>
As I to-day had hoped thyself to snare,<BR>
And dames and knights, and more of high degree,<BR>
Have to this tower conveyed, his lot to share,<BR>
That with such partners of his prison pent,<BR>
He might the loss of freedom less lament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Save they should seek to break their dungeon&#8217;s bound,<BR>
I grant my inmates every other pleasure.<BR>
For whatsoever in the world is found,<BR>
Search its four quarters, in this keep I treasure;<BR>
(Whatever heart can wish or tongue can sound)<BR>
Cates, brave attire, game, sport, or mirthful measure.<BR>
My field well sown, I well had reaped my grain.<BR>
But that thy coming makes my labour vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! then unless thy heart less beauteous be<BR>
Than thy sweet face, mar not my pious care;<BR>
Take my steel buckler, this I give to thee,<BR>
And take that horse, which flies so fast in air,<BR>
Nor meddle with my castle more; or free<BR>
One or two captive friends, the rest forbear&#8212;<BR>
Or (for I crave but this) release them all,<BR>
So that Rogero but remain my thrall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Or if disposed to take him from my sight,<BR>
Before the youth be into France conveyed,<BR>
Be pleased to free my miserable sprite<BR>
From its now rotted bark, long decayed.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;Prate as thou wilt, I shall restore the knight<BR>
To liberty,&#8221; replied the martial maid,<BR>
&#8220;Nor offer shield and courser to resign,<BR>
Which are not in thy gift,&#8212;already mine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor were they thine to take or to bestow,<BR>
Would it appear that such exchange were wise;<BR>
Thou sayest to save him from what stars foreshow,<BR>
And cheat an evil influence of the skies<BR>
Rogero is confined. Thou canst not know,<BR>
Or knowing, canst not change his destinies:<BR>
For, if unknown an ill so near to thee,<BR>
Far less mayest thou another&#8217;s fate foresee.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Seek not thy death from me; for the petition<BR>
Is made in vain; but if for death thou sigh,<BR>
Though the whole world refused the requisition,<BR>
A soul resolved would find the means to die.<BR>
But ope thy gates to give thy guests dismission<BR>
Before thine hand the knot of life untie.&#8221;<BR>
So spake the scornful dame with angry mock,<BR>
Speeding her captive still towards the rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Bound by the conqueror with the chain he bore,<BR>
Atlantes walked, the damsel following nigh,<BR>
Who trusted not to the magician hoar,<BR>
Although he seemed subdued in port and eye.<BR>
Nor many paces went the pair, before<BR>
They at the mountain&#8217;s foot the cleft espy,<BR>
With steps by which the rugged hill to round;<BR>
And climb, till to the castle-gate they wound:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Atlantes from the threshold, graved by skill,<BR>
With characters and wondrous signs, upturned<BR>
A virtuous stone, where, underneath the sill,<BR>
Pots, with perpetual fire and secret, burned.<BR>
The enchanter breaks them; and at once the hill<BR>
To an inhospitable rock is turned.<BR>
Nor wall nor tower on any side is seen,<BR>
As if no castle there had ever been.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Then from the lady&#8217;s toils the wizard clears<BR>
His limbs, as thrush escapes the fowler&#8217;s snare;<BR>
With him as well his castle disappears,<BR>
And leaves the prisoned troop in open air;<BR>
From their gay lodgings, dames and cavaliers,<BR>
Unhoused upon that desert, bleak and bare.<BR>
And many at the freedom felt annoy,<BR>
Which dispossessed them of such life of joy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
There is Gradasso, there is Sacripant,<BR>
There is Prasildo, noble cavalier,<BR>
Who with Rinaldo came from the Levant;<BR>
Iroldo, too, Prasildo&#8217;s friend sincere.<BR>
And there, at last, the lovely Bradamant<BR>
Discerns Rogero, long desired and dear;<BR>
Who, when assured it was that lady, flew<BR>
With joyful cheer to greet the damsel true;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
As her he prized before his eyes, his heart,<BR>
His life; from that day cherished when she stood<BR>
Uncasqued for him, and from the fight apart;<BR>
And hence an arrow drank her virgin blood,<BR>
&#8217;Twere long to tell who launched the cruel dart,<BR>
And how the lovers wandered in the wood:<BR>
Now guided by the sun, and now benighted,<BR>
Here first since that encounter reunited.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
Now that the stripling sees her here, and knows<BR>
Alone she freed him from the wizard&#8217;s nest,<BR>
He deems, his bosom with such joy overflows,<BR>
That he is singly fortunate and blest.<BR>
Thither, where late the damsel conquered, goes<BR>
The band, descending from the mountain&#8217;s crest;<BR>
And finds the hippogryph, who bore the shield,<BR>
But in its case of crimson silk concealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
To take him by the rein the lady there<BR>
Approached, and he stood fast till she was nigh,<BR>
Then spread his pinions to the liquid air,<BR>
And at short distance lit, half-mountain high:<BR>
And, as she follows him with fruitless care,<BR>
Not longer flight nor shorter will he try.<BR>
&#8217;Tis thus the raven, on some sandy beach,<BR>
Lures on the dog, and flits beyond his reach.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Gradasso, Sacripant, Rogero, who<BR>
With all those other knights below were met,<BR>
Where&#8217;er, they hope he may return, pursue<BR>
The beast, and up and down, each pass beset.<BR>
He having led those others, as he flew,<BR>
Often to rocky height, and bottom wet,<BR>
Among the rocks of the moist valley dropt,<BR>
And at short distance from Rogero stopt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
This was Atlantes the enchanter&#8217;s deed,<BR>
Whose pious wishes still directed were,<BR>
To see Rogero from his peril freed:<BR>
This was his only thought, his only care;<BR>
Who for such end dispatched the winged steed,<BR>
Him out of Europe by this sleight to bear.<BR>
Rogero took his bridle, but in vain;<BR>
For he was restive to the guiding rein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Now the bold youth from his Frontino flings<BR>
(Frontino was his gentle courser hight)<BR>
Then leaps on him who towers in air, and stings<BR>
And goads his haughty heart with rowels bright.<BR>
He runs a short career; then upward springs.<BR>
And through mid ether soars a fairer flight<BR>
Than hawk, from which the falconer plucks away<BR>
In time the blinding hood, and points her prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
When her Rogero the fair dame discerned,<BR>
In fearful peril, soar so high a strain,<BR>
She stood long space amazed, ere she returned<BR>
To her right judgement, and sound wits again:<BR>
And what she erst of Ganymede had learned,<BR>
Snatched up to heaven from his paternal reign,<BR>
Feared might befall the stripling, born through air,<BR>
As gentle as young Ganymede and fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
She on Rogero looks with stedfast eyes<BR>
As long as feeble sight can serve her use;<BR>
And in her mind next tracks him through the skies,<BR>
When sight in vain the cherished youth pursues.<BR>
And still renewing tears, and groans, and sighs,<BR>
Will not afford her sorrow peace or truce.<BR>
After the knight had vanished from her view,<BR>
Her eyes she on the good Frontino threw.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
And lest the courser should become the prey<BR>
Of the first traveller, who passed the glen,<BR>
Him will not leave; but thence to bear away<BR>
Resolves, in trust to see his lord again.<BR>
The griffin soars, nor can Rogero stay<BR>
The flying courser; while, beneath his ken,<BR>
Each peak and promontory sinks in guise,<BR>
That he discerns not flat from mountain-rise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
After the hippogryph has won such height,<BR>
That he is lessened to a point, he bends<BR>
His course for where the sun, with sinking light,<BR>
When he goes round the heavenly crab, descends;<BR>
And shoots through air, like well-greased bark and light,<BR>
Which through the sea a wind propitious sends.<BR>
Him leave we on his way, who well shall speed,<BR>
And turn we to Rinaldo in his need.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Day after day the good Rinaldo fares,<BR>
Forced by the wind, the spacious ocean through;<BR>
Now westward borne, and now toward the B<SMALL>EARS</SMALL>;<BR>
For night and day the ceaseless tempest blew.<BR>
Scotland at last her dusky coast uprears,<BR>
And gives the Caledonian wood to view;<BR>
Which, through its shadowy groves of ancient oak,<BR>
Oft echoes to the champion&#8217;s sturdy stroke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Through this roves many a famous cavalier,<BR>
Renowned for feat in arms, of British strain;<BR>
And throng from distant land, or country near,<BR>
French, Norse, or German knights, a numerous train.<BR>
Let none, save he be valiant, venture here,<BR>
Where, seeking glory, death may be his gain.<BR>
Here Arthur, Galahalt, and Gauvaine fought,<BR>
And well Sir Launcelot and Tristram wrought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
And other worthies of the table round;<BR>
(Of either table, whether old or new)<BR>
Whose trophies yet remain upon the ground;<BR>
Proof of their valiant feats, Rinaldo true<BR>
Forthwith his armour and Bayardo found,<BR>
And landed on the woody coast: The crew<BR>
He bade, with all the haste they might, repair<BR>
To Berwick&#8217;s neighbouring port, and wait him there.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Without a guide or company he went<BR>
Through that wide forest; choosing now this way,<BR>
Now that, now other, as it might present<BR>
Hope of adventurous quest or hard assay:<BR>
And, ere the first day&#8217;s circling sun is spent,<BR>
The peer is guested in an abbey gray:<BR>
Which spends much wealth in harbouring those who claim<BR>
Its shelter, warlike knight or wandering dame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
The monks and abbot to Mount Alban&#8217;s peer<BR>
A goodly welcome in their house accord;<BR>
Who asked, but not before with savoury cheer<BR>
He amply had his wearied strength restored,<BR>
If in that tract, by errant cavalier,<BR>
Often adventurous quest might be explored,<BR>
In which a man might prove, by dangerous deed,<BR>
If blame or glory were his fitting meed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
They answered, in those woods he might be sure<BR>
Many and strange adventures would be found;<BR>
But deeds, there wrought, were, like the place, obscure,<BR>
And, for the greater part, not bruited round.<BR>
&#8220;Then seek (they said) a worthier quest, secure<BR>
Your works will not be buried underground.<BR>
So that the glorious act achieved, as due,<BR>
Fame may your peril and your pain pursue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if you would your warlike worth assay,<BR>
Prepare the worthiest enterprize to hear,<BR>
That, e&#8217;er in times of old or present day,<BR>
Was undertaken by a cavalier.<BR>
Our monarch&#8217;s daughter needs some friendly stay,<BR>
Now sore bested, against a puissant peer:<BR>
Lurcanio is the doughty baron&#8217;s name,<BR>
Who would bereave her both of life and fame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her he before her father does pursue,<BR>
Perchance yet more for hatred than for right;<BR>
And vouches, to a gallery she updrew<BR>
A lover, seen by him, at dead of night.<BR>
Hence death by fire will be the damsel&#8217;s due,<BR>
Such is our law, unless some champion fight<BR>
On her behalf, and, ere a month go by,<BR>
(Nigh spent) upon the accuser prove the lie.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Our impious Scottish law, severe and dread,<BR>
Wills, that a woman, whether low or high<BR>
Her state, who takes a man into her bed,<BR>
Except her husband, for the offence shall die.<BR>
Nor is there hope of ransom for her head,<BR>
Unless to her defence some warrior hie;<BR>
And as her champion true, with spear and shield,<BR>
Maintain her guiltless in the listed field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The king, sore grieving for Geneura bright,<BR>
For such is his unhappy daughter&#8217;s name,<BR>
Proclaims by town and city, that the knight<BR>
Who shall deliver her from death and shame,<BR>
He to the royal damsel will unite,<BR>
With dower, well suited to a royal dame;<BR>
So that the valiant warrior who has stood<BR>
In her defence, be come of gentle blood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if within a month no knight appear,<BR>
Or coming, conquer not, the damsel dies.<BR>
A like emprize were worthier of your spear<BR>
Than wandering through these woods in lowly guise.<BR>
Besides, the eternal trophy you shall rear,<BR>
You by the deed shall gain a glorious prize,<BR>
The sweetest flower of all the ladies fair<BR>
That betwixt Ind and Atlas&#8217; pillars are.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And you with wealth and state shall guerdoned be,<BR>
So that you evermore may live content,<BR>
And the king&#8217;s grace, if through your means he see<BR>
His honour raised anew, now well-nigh spent.<BR>
Besides, you by the laws of chivalry<BR>
Are bound to venge the damsel foully shent.<BR>
For she, whose life is by such treason sought,<BR>
Is chaste and spotless in the common thought.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo mused awhile, and then replied,<BR>
&#8220;And must a gentle damsel die by fire,<BR>
Because she with a lover&#8217;s wish complied,<BR>
And quenched within her arms his fond desire?<BR>
Cursed be the law by which the dame is tried!<BR>
Cursed he who would permit a doom so dire!<BR>
Perish (such fate were just!) who cruel proves!<BR>
Not she that life bestows on him who loves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Or true or false Geneura&#8217;s tale of shame;<BR>
If she her lover blessed I little heed:<BR>
For this my praise the lady well might claim,<BR>
If manifest were not that gentle deed.<BR>
My every thought is turned to aid the dame.<BR>
Grant me but one to guide my steps, and lead<BR>
Quickly to where the foul accuser stands,<BR>
I trust in God to loose Geneura&#8217;s bands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I will not vouch her guiltless in my thought,<BR>
In fear to warrant what is false; but I<BR>
Boldly maintain, in such an act is nought<BR>
For which the damsel should deserve to die;<BR>
And ween unjust, or else of wit distraught,<BR>
Who statutes framed of such severity;<BR>
Which, as iniquitous, should be effaced,<BR>
And with a new and better code replaced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If like desire, and if an equal flame<BR>
Move one and the other sex, who warmly press<BR>
To that soft end of love (their goal the same)<BR>
Which to the witless crowd seems rank excess;<BR>
Say why shall woman&#8212;merit scathe or blame,<BR>
Though lovers, one or more, she may caress;<BR>
While man to sin with whom he will is free,<BR>
And meets with praise, not mere impunity?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By this injurious law, unequal still,<BR>
On woman is inflicted open wrong;<BR>
And to demonstrate it a grievous ill,<BR>
I trust in God, which has been borne too long.&#8221;<BR>
To good Rinaldo&#8217;s sentence, with one will,<BR>
Deeming their sires unjust, assents the throng,<BR>
Their sires who such outrageous statute penned,<BR>
And king, who might, but does not, this amend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
When the new dawn, with streaks of red and white,<BR>
Broke in the east, and cleared the hemisphere,<BR>
Rinaldo took his steed and armour bright:<BR>
A squire that abbey furnished to the peer.<BR>
With him, for many leagues and miles, the knight<BR>
Pricked through the dismal forest dark and drear;<BR>
While they towards the Scottish city ride,<BR>
Where the poor damsel&#8217;s cause is to be tried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Seeking their way to shorten as they wound,<BR>
They to the wider track a path preferred;<BR>
When echoing through the gloomy forest round,<BR>
Loud lamentations nigh the road were heard.<BR>
Towards a neighbouring vale, whence came the sound,<BR>
This his Bayardo, that his hackney spurred;<BR>
And viewed, between two grisly ruffians there,<BR>
A girl, who seemed at distance passing fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
But woe begone and weeping was the maid<BR>
As ever damsel dame, or wight was seen;<BR>
Hard by the barbarous twain prepared the blade,<BR>
To deluge with that damsel&#8217;s blood the green.<BR>
She to delay her death awhile essayed,<BR>
Until she pity moved with mournful mien.<BR>
This when Rinaldo near approaching eyes,<BR>
He thither drives with threats and furious cries.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
The ruffians turn their backs and take to flight<BR>
As soon as they the distant succour view,<BR>
And squat within a valley out of sight:<BR>
Nor cares the good Rinaldo to pursue.<BR>
To her approaching, sues Mount Alban&#8217;s knight,<BR>
To say what on her head such evil drew;<BR>
And, to save time, commands his squire to stoop,<BR>
And take the damsel on his horse&#8217;s croup.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
And as the lady nearer he surveyed,<BR>
Her wise behaviour marked and beauty&#8217;s bloom;<BR>
Though her fait countenance was all dismayed,<BR>
And by the fear of death o&#8217;erspread with gloom.<BR>
Again to know, the gentle knight essayed,<BR>
Who had prepared for her so fell a doom;<BR>
And she began to tell in humble tone<BR>
What to another canto I postpone.</TD></TR>
