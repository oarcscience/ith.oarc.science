<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Great feats achieve Orlando by the way.<BR>
The Tartar king is by Rogero slain:<BR>
For whom fair Bradamant, his spouse, does stay,<BR>
But Fate forbade, that he who wounded lay<BR>
To her his plighted promise should maintain.<BR>
He after boldly with the brethren made,<BR>
Their lord Rinaldo in his need to aid.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
When Reason, giving way to heat of blood,<BR>
Herself from hasty choler ill defends,<BR>
And, hurried on by blind and furious mood,<BR>
We with the tongue or hand molest our friends,<BR>
Though the offence is, after, wept and rued,<BR>
The penance which we pay is poor amends.<BR>
Alas! I sorrow and lament in vain<BR>
For what I said in other angry strain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
But like sick man am I, who, sore bested,<BR>
Suffering with patience many and many a day,<BR>
When against pain he can no more make head,<BR>
Yields to his rage, and curses; pain give way,<BR>
And with it the impetuous wrath is fled,<BR>
Which moved his ready tongue such ill to say;<BR>
And he is left his willful rage to rue,<BR>
But cannot that which he has done undo.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Well hope I, from your sovereign courtesy,<BR>
Your pardon, since I crave it, ladies bright;<BR>
You will excuse, if moved by madness, I<BR>
Rave in my passion; let your censure light<BR>
On foe, who treats me so despiteously,<BR>
I could not be reduced to worser plight;<BR>
Who prompts what sore repents me: Heaven above<BR>
Knows how she wrongs me, knows how well I love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
No less beside myself than Brava&#8217;s peer<BR>
And I, nor less my pardon should obtain;<BR>
He, who by mead or mountain, far or near,<BR>
Had scowered large portion of the land of Spain,<BR>
Dragging that jennet in his wild career,<BR>
Dead as she was, behind him by the rein;<BR>
But, where a river joined the sea, parforce<BR>
Abandoned on the bank her mangled corse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
And he, who could like any otter swim,<BR>
Leapt in and rose upon the further side.<BR>
Behold! a mounted shepherd at the brim<BR>
Arrived, his horse to water in the tide;<BR>
Nor when he saw Orlando coming, him<BR>
Eschewed, whom naked and alone he spied.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;My jennet for thy hackney were I fain<BR>
To barter,&#8221; cried the madman to the swain:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her will I show thee, if thou wilt; who dead<BR>
Upon the river&#8217;s other margin fell;<BR>
At leisure may&#8217;st thou have her cured,&#8221; (he said)<BR>
&#8220;And of no other fault have I to tell.<BR>
Give me thy hackney, with some boot instead:<BR>
Prythee, dismount thee, for he likes me well.&#8221;<BR>
The peasant, laughing, answered not a word,<BR>
But left the fool and pricked towards the ford.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hearest thou not? hola! I want thy steed,&#8221;<BR>
(Cried Roland) and advanced with wrathful cheer.<BR>
A solid staff and knotted, for his need,<BR>
That shepherd had, wherewith he smote the peer;<BR>
Whose violence and ire all bounds exceed,<BR>
Who seems withal to wax more fierce than e&#8217;er:<BR>
A cuff he levels at that rustic&#8217;s head,<BR>
And splits the solid bone, and lays him dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Then leaping on his horse, by different way<BR>
The country scowers, to make more spoil and wrack:<BR>
That palfrey never more tastes corn or hay;<BR>
So that few days exhaust the famished hack.<BR>
But not afoot does fierce Orlando stray,<BR>
Who will not, while he lives, conveyance lack.<BR>
As many as he finds, so many steeds<BR>
&#8212;Their masters slain&#8212;he presses for his needs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
He came at last to Malaga, and here<BR>
Did mightier scathe than he had done elsewhere;<BR>
For now&#8212;besides that the infuriate peer<BR>
Of all its people left the country bare,<BR>
Nor (such the ravage) could another year<BR>
The desperate havoc of the fool repair&#8212;<BR>
So many houses burnt he, or cast down,<BR>
Sacked was a third of that unhappy town.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Departing thence, insane Orlando flees<BR>
To Zizera, a seaward town, whose site<BR>
Is in Gibraltar&#8217;s bay, or (if you please)<BR>
Say Gibletar&#8217;s; for either way &#8217;tis hight;<BR>
Here, loosening from the land, a boat he sees<BR>
Filled with a party, and for pleasure dight:<BR>
Which, for their solace, to the morning gale,<BR>
Upon that summer sea, had spread their sail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hoah! the boat! put back!&#8221; the count &#8217;gan cry,<BR>
Who was in mind to go aboard their barge:<BR>
But vainly on their ears his clamours die:<BR>
For of such freight none willingly take charge.<BR>
As swiftly as a swallow cleaves the sky,<BR>
Furrowing the foamy wave the boat goes large.<BR>
Orlando urges on, with straightening knee,<BR>
And whip and spur, his horse towards the sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
He plunged into the waves, at last, parforce;<BR>
For vainly would he shun the waters green.<BR>
Bathed are knees, paunch, and croup, till of that horse<BR>
Scarcely the head above the wave is seen:<BR>
Let him not hope to measure back his course,<BR>
While smitten with the whip his ears between.<BR>
Woe worth him! he must founder by the way,<BR>
Or into Africa his load convey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Nor poops nor prows does Roland more descry,<BR>
For all have launched their shallops, which are wide<BR>
Of that dry shore; while from his level eye<BR>
Their hulls the tall and shifting surges hide.<BR>
He spurs his horse amid the billows high,<BR>
Wholly resolved to reach the farther side.<BR>
The courser ends his swim and life in fine,<BR>
Drained of his strength, and drenched brimfull of brine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
He sinks, and would with him draw down his load;<BR>
But that himself the madman&#8217;s arms upbear:<BR>
With sinewy arms and either palm he rowed,<BR>
And puffed and blew the brine before; the air<BR>
Breathed softly, and the water gently flowed;<BR>
And well was needed weather more than fair:<BR>
For if the waters yet a little rise,<BR>
Whelmed by the waxing tide Orlando dies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
But Fortune, that of madmen is the guide,<BR>
Him from the water drew near Ceuta&#8217;s shore,<BR>
Upon that beach, and of those walls as wide<BR>
As twice an archer&#8217;s hand could shoot at score.<BR>
For many days along the bank he hied,<BR>
At hazard, ever westward hurrying sore,<BR>
Until he came where on the sea-beat strand<BR>
Encamped a host of blacks, a countless band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Leave we the paladin at will to stray!<BR>
To speak of him occasion will come round.<BR>
&#8212;Sir, what befel the lady of Cat&agrave;y,<BR>
Who scaped, in time, from him of wit unsound,<BR>
And afterwards, upon her homeward way,<BR>
Was with good bark and better weather bound;<BR>
And how she made Medoro, India&#8217;s king;<BR>
Perchance some voice in happier verse may sing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
To say so many things I am intent,<BR>
I mean not to pursue the cavalier.<BR>
To Mandricardo my fair argument<BR>
It now behoves me, in his turn, to veer<BR>
He happily enjoyed, his rival spent,<BR>
The beauty, left in Europe without peer,<BR>
Since fair Angelica from hence had wended,<BR>
And virtuous Isabel to heaven ascended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
King Mandricardo, proud that in his right<BR>
His lady had adjudged the amorous suit,<BR>
Enjoys not her award with full delight;<BR>
Since others with him other points dispute.<BR>
By young Rogero claimed, that eagle white<BR>
Of one disastrous quarrel is the root;<BR>
Another moves the king of Sericana<BR>
Against the Tartar king, for Durindana.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Agramant and Marsilius strive in vain,<BR>
With labour sore, this tangle to undo;<BR>
Nor only cannot they persuade the twain<BR>
In peace and concord to unite anew,<BR>
But cannot make the valiant Child refrain<BR>
From claiming Hector&#8217;s buckler as his due;<BR>
Nor yet Gradasso move the sword to lend,<BR>
&#8216;Till this, or till that, quarrel have an end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Rogero brooks not that in other fight<BR>
His shield be braced, nor will Gradasso bear<BR>
That save against himself the Tartar knight<BR>
Should wield the sword Orlando used to wear<BR>
&#8220;See we, in fine, on whom the chance will light<BR>
(Cries Agramant) and further words forbear.<BR>
How Fortune rules the matter let us see,<BR>
And choose him that of her shall chosen be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And&#8212;would ye do what most would me delight,<BR>
And be an obligation evermore&#8212;<BR>
You shall by casting lots decide your right:<BR>
Premising, he whose lot is drawn before<BR>
The other, shall upon two quarrels fight:<BR>
So he who wins, on his companion&#8217;s score<BR>
Shall win as well as on his own; and who<BR>
Loses the battle lose alike for two.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Between Rogero and Gradasso, we<BR>
Deem there is little difference, rather none;<BR>
And wot whichever shall elected be.<BR>
In arms will make his martial prowess known,<BR>
As for the rest, let doubtful victory<BR>
Descend on him whom Heaven is pleased to own!<BR>
Upon the vanquished knight no blame shall fall,<BR>
But we to Fortune will impute it all.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero and Gradasso, at this say<BR>
Of Agramant, stood silent, and agreed,<BR>
That he whose lot first issued, the assay<BR>
Should undertake for both in listed mead.<BR>
Thus in two scrolls, inscribed in the same way,<BR>
Their names are writ as destined to succeed.<BR>
These afterwards are cast into an urn,<BR>
Which much they shake and topsy turvy turn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
A seely boy then dipt his hand and drew<BR>
A billet from the vase, and if befel,<BR>
Thereon Rogero&#8217;s name the assistants knew;<BR>
&#8212;Gradasso&#8217;s left behind&#8212;I cannot tell<BR>
How joyed renowned Rogero at the view,<BR>
And can as little say what sorrow fell<BR>
Upon Gradasso, on the other side;<BR>
But he parforce his fortune must abide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Gradasso every thought and every deed<BR>
Employs, Rogero to instruct and aid,<BR>
That in the strife his champion may succeed;<BR>
And teaches every sleight he has assaid:<BR>
&#8212;How best to manage sword and shield at need&#8212;<BR>
&#8212;What strokes are feints, and what with vantage made&#8212;<BR>
And when he should tempt Fortune, when eschew&#8212;<BR>
Reminds him, one by one, in long review.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
After the drawing lots and king&#8217;s award,<BR>
What of the day remained the champions spent<BR>
As wont, in giving tokens of regard,<BR>
To this or to that other warrior sent.<BR>
The people, greedy for the fight, toward<BR>
The field is gone, and many not content<BR>
With wending thither ere the dawn of light,<BR>
Upon the place of combat watch all night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
The foolish rabble anxiously attends<BR>
Those goodly champions&#8217; contest for the prize,<BR>
A crowd which neither sees nor comprehends<BR>
Other than that which is before its eyes.<BR>
But they who know what boots and what offends,<BR>
&#8212;Marsilius and Sobrino, and the wise&#8212;<BR>
Censure the fight, and monarch that affords<BR>
A field of combat to those martial lords.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Nor what a heavy loss he would sustain<BR>
(Cease they to royal Agramant to read)<BR>
Were Mandricardo or Rogero slain;<BR>
A thing by cruel Destiny decreed.<BR>
Since they, to combat against Charlemagne,<BR>
Of one of these alone have greater need<BR>
Than of ten thousand more, amid which crew<BR>
They scarce would find one champion good and true.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Agramant recognized this truth; but thought<BR>
That ill his royal word could be repealed;<BR>
Yet Mandricardo and the Child besought<BR>
That they the right, conferred by him, would yield:<BR>
More; that the question was a thing of nought,<BR>
Nor worthy to be tried in martial field;<BR>
And prayed them&#8212;would they not obey his hest<BR>
At least somewhile, to let their quarrel rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Five or six months would they the strife delay,<BR>
Or more or less, till Charles defeated were,<BR>
And stript of mantle, crown, and royal sway.<BR>
But each, though he would willingly forbear,<BR>
And much desired his sovereign to obey,<BR>
Stood out against the Moorish monarch&#8217;s prayer:<BR>
Since either deemed he would be foully shent<BR>
Who to this treaty first should yield consent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
But more than king, than all, who sought in vain<BR>
To soften Agrican&#8217;s infuriate son,<BR>
The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane<BR>
Lamented, besought him, woe-begone,<BR>
Besought him he would do what all would fain<BR>
Behold by the relenting warrior done;<BR>
&#8212;Lamenting her, as through the cavalier,<BR>
For ever kept in agony and fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alas! and what (exclaims she) can I find<BR>
Which may avail to minister repose,<BR>
If aye, by this or that desire inclined,<BR>
You don your harness to affront new foes?<BR>
What boots it to restore my harassed mind<BR>
That I behold one fearful quarrel&#8217;s close,<BR>
Against one champion moved for love of me,<BR>
If one as fierce already kindled be?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Woe worth me! I was proud, with little right,<BR>
So good a king, so stout a cavalier<BR>
For he should in the fierce and dangerous fight<BR>
Peril his life, who now, I see to clear,<BR>
Upon a ground of strife so passing light,<BR>
With the same risk prepares to couch the spear.<BR>
You, more than love for me, to strife impels<BR>
The natural rage, wherewith your bosom swells.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if the love you force yourself to show,<BR>
Be in good earnest, that which you profess,<BR>
By this I pray you, by that chastening woe<BR>
Which does my spirit, does my heart oppress,<BR>
Be not concerned, because the bird of snow<BR>
Rogero, pictured on his shield, possess.<BR>
I know not wherefore you should joy or grieve<BR>
That he the blazoned buckler bear or leave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Much evil may ensue and little gain<BR>
Out of the battle you to wage prepare;<BR>
Small guerdon will be bought with mickle pain<BR>
If from Rogero you his eagle bear;<BR>
But if your fortune shifts on listed plain,<BR>
She whom you hold not captive by her hair,<BR>
You cause an evil with such mischief fraught,<BR>
My heart is broken at the simple thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If of small value life to you appear,<BR>
And you esteem a painted bird more high,<BR>
At least for my life&#8217;s sake esteem yours dear;<BR>
For one without the other shall not die.<BR>
With you to die excites in me no fear;<BR>
With you, prepared for life or death am I:<BR>
Yet would I fain not die so ill content,<BR>
As I should die if you before me went.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Accompanying words with tears and sighs,<BR>
In such, or such like speech she him did pray,<BR>
Throughout that livelong night, in piteous wise,<BR>
Hoping her lover&#8217;s anger to allay;<BR>
And Mandricardo, sucking from her eyes<BR>
Those sweet tears, glittering in their humid ray,<BR>
And that sweet moan, from lips more deeply dyed<BR>
Than crimson rose, himself in tears, replied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alack! my dearest life! take thou no dread,<BR>
Alack! for love of Heaven! of thing so light:<BR>
For if (to my sole harm) with banners spread,<BR>
Their following of the Frank or paynim rite<BR>
King Agramant and Charles united led,<BR>
This need not cause you matter for affright.<BR>
What poor account you make of me is clear<BR>
If this one, sole, Rogero breeds such fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And yet should you remember how alone<BR>
(Nor had I scimetar or sword in hand)<BR>
Of knights, with a spear&#8217;s truncheon overthrown,<BR>
I singly cleared the field, an armed band.<BR>
Though to his shame and sorrow this he own,<BR>
Gradasso tells to them who make demand,<BR>
He was my prisoner in the Syrian tower:<BR>
Yet other than Rogero&#8217;s is his power.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not King Gradasso will the truth deny:<BR>
Sacripant knows it and your Isolier:<BR>
I say King Sacripant of Circassy,<BR>
And Aquilant, and Gryphon, famous peer;<BR>
With hundreds&#8212;yea and more&#8212;from far and nigh<BR>
Made prisoners at that fearful pass whilere,<BR>
Baptized or Infidel; and all by me<BR>
From prison on the selfsame day set free.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And even yet they marvel evermore<BR>
At the great feat which I performed that day;<BR>
Greater than if the squadrons of the Moor<BR>
And Frank united I had held at bay;<BR>
And shall Rogero, new to martial lore,<BR>
Me, onto to one, with scathe or scorn appay?<BR>
And me shall now this young Rogero scare,<BR>
When Hector&#8217;s sword and Hector&#8217;s arms I wear?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! as I might have won you from my foe,<BR>
Why did I not for you in arms contend?<BR>
I so had them my valour shown, I know,<BR>
You would have well foreseen Rogero&#8217;s end.<BR>
For heaven&#8217;s sake dry your tears, nor by such woe<BR>
&#8212;An evil omen for my arms&#8212;offend;<BR>
And learn, &#8217;tis Honour pricks me to the field,<BR>
And not an argent bird and blazoned shield.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
So said he; and with reasons passing good<BR>
To him that dame replied, with saddest face;<BR>
Nor only would have changed his sullen mood,<BR>
But would have moved a pillar from its place.<BR>
She would the champion quickly have subdued,<BR>
Though she was gowned, he locked in iron case;<BR>
And make him satisfy the Moorish lord,<BR>
If Agramant spake further of accord;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
And had; but that Aurora&#8212;on his way<BR>
Ushering aye the sun&#8212;no sooner stirred,<BR>
Than young Rogero, anxious to display<BR>
That rightfully he bore Jove&#8217;s beauteous bird,<BR>
To cut the quarrel short, and lest delay<BR>
Be further interposed, in act or word,<BR>
Where round the palisade the people close,<BR>
Appears in armour and his bugle blows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
When that loud sound is by the Tartar heard,<BR>
Which the proud warrior to the strife defies,<BR>
No more of treaty will he hear a word:<BR>
From bed upspringing, &#8220;Arms,&#8221; the monarch cries,<BR>
And shows a visage with such fury stirred,<BR>
Doralice dares no longer peace advise,<BR>
Nor speak of treaty or of truce anew;<BR>
And now parforce the battle must ensue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
The Tartar arms himself in haste; with pain<BR>
The wonted service of his squires he tarries:<BR>
This done, he springs upon the steed amain,<BR>
Erewhile the champion&#8217;s who defended Paris;<BR>
And him with speed towards the listed plain,<BR>
Fixt for that fierce assay, the courser carries.<BR>
Even then the king and barons thither made,<BR>
So that the strife was little time delaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
Put on and laced the shining helmets were,<BR>
And given to either champion was the spear:<BR>
Quickly the trumpet&#8217;s blast was heard in air,<BR>
Whose signal blanched a thousand cheeks with fear.<BR>
Levelled those cavaliers their lances bear,<BR>
Spurring their warlike steeds to the career,<BR>
And, in mid champaign, meet with such a shock,<BR>
That Earth appears to rive and Heaven to rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
From this side and from that, the eagle flew,<BR>
Which Jove in air was wonted to sustain;<BR>
So hurtled, but with plumes of different hue,<BR>
Those others often on Thessalian plain.<BR>
The beamy lances, rested by the two,<BR>
Well warranted the warriors&#8217; might and main,<BR>
And worse than that encounter had withstood:<BR>
So towers resist the wind, so rocks the flood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
As Turpin truly writes, into the sky<BR>
Upwent the splinters, broke in the career;<BR>
For two or three fell flaming from on high,<BR>
Which had ascended to the starry sphere.<BR>
The knights unsheathed their faulchions from the thigh,<BR>
And, like those who were little moved by fear,<BR>
For new encounter wheeled, and, man to man,<BR>
Pointing at one another&#8217;s vizor ran.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
They, pointing at the vizors&#8217; sight, attacked,<BR>
Nor with their faulchions at the steeds took aim,<BR>
Each other to unhorse, unseemly act!<BR>
Since in that quarrel they are nought to blame.<BR>
Those err, nor know the usage, why by pact<BR>
Deem they were bound their horses not to maim:<BR>
Without pact made, &#8217;twas reckoned a misdeed,<BR>
And an eternal blot to smite a steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
They level at the vizor, which is double,<BR>
And yet resists such mighty blows with pain.<BR>
The champions evermore their strokes redouble<BR>
Faster than pattering hail, which mars the grain,<BR>
And bruises branch and leaf, and stalk and stubble,<BR>
And cheats the hopes of the expecting swain.<BR>
To you is known the force of either brand,<BR>
And known the force of either warrior&#8217;s hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
But yet no stroke well worthy of their might<BR>
Those peers have dealt, so cautious are the twain.<BR>
The Tartar&#8217;s faulchion was the first to bite,<BR>
By which was good Rogero well nigh slain.<BR>
By one of those fell blows which either knight<BR>
So well could plant, his shield was cleft in twain;<BR>
Beneath, his cuirass opened to the stroke,<BR>
And to the quick the cruel weapon broke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
The assistants&#8217; hearts were frozen at the blow,<BR>
So did Rogero&#8217;s danger them appal,<BR>
On whom the many&#8217;s favor, well they know,<BR>
And wishes rest, if not of one and all.<BR>
And then (had Fortune ordered matters so,<BR>
As the most part desired they should befall)<BR>
Taken had been the Tartar king or slain;<BR>
So had that blow offended all the train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
I think that blow was by some angel stayed,<BR>
To save Rogero from the mischief near:<BR>
Yet at the king (nor answer he delayed)<BR>
He dealt a stroke more terrible than e&#8217;er.<BR>
As Mandricardo&#8217;s head he aims his blade,<BR>
But such the fury of the cavalier,<BR>
And such his haste, he less my blame deserves,<BR>
If slanting from the mark his faulchion swerves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Had Balisarda smote him full, though crowned<BR>
With Hector&#8217;s helm, the enchantment had been vain.<BR>
So reels the Tartar, by that stroke astound,<BR>
He from the bristle-hand lets go the rein:<BR>
Thrice with his head he threats to smite the ground,<BR>
While his unguided courser scowers the plain;<BR>
That Brigliadoro, whom by name you know,<BR>
Yet, for his change of master, full of woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Never raged trampled serpent, never so<BR>
Raged wounded lion, as in fell despite<BR>
Raged Mandricardo, rallying from that blow,<BR>
Which had deprived of sense the astonied knight;<BR>
And as his pride and fury waxes, grow<BR>
As much, yea more, his valour and his might.<BR>
He at Rogero makes his courser vault,<BR>
With sword uplifted high for the assault.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Poised in his stirrups stood the Tartar lord,<BR>
And aiming at his foeman&#8217;s casque, believed<BR>
He with the stroke of his descending sword<BR>
Rogero to the bosom should have cleaved;<BR>
But from that youth, yet quicker in his ward,<BR>
A wound beneath his arm the king received,<BR>
Which made wide daylight in the stubborn mail,<BR>
That clothed the better armpit with its scale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero drawing Balisarda back,<BR>
Out sprang the tepid blood of crimson stain;<BR>
Hence Mandricardo&#8217;s arm did vigour lack,<BR>
And with less dint descended Durindane:<BR>
Yet on the croup the stripling tumbled back,<BR>
Closing his eyelids, through excess of pain;<BR>
And memorable aye had been that blow,<BR>
Had a worse helmet clothed the warrior&#8217;s brow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
For this he pauses not, but spurs amain,<BR>
And Mandricardo smites in the right side.<BR>
Here little boots the texture of the chain,<BR>
And the well wealded metal&#8217;s temper tried,<BR>
Against that sword, which never falls in vain,<BR>
Which was enchanted to no end beside,<BR>
But that against it nothing should avail,<BR>
Enchanted corselet or enchanted mail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Whate&#8217;er that sword takes-in it shears outright,<BR>
And in the Tartar&#8217;s side inflicts a wound:<BR>
He curses Heaven and raves in such despite,<BR>
Less horribly the boisterous billows sound.<BR>
He now prepares to put forth all his might:<BR>
The shield, with argent bird and azure ground,<BR>
He hurls, with rage transported, from his hand,<BR>
And grasps with right and left his trenchant brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Marry,&#8221; (Rogero cried,) &#8220;it needs no more<BR>
To prove your title to that ensign vain,<BR>
Which now you cast away, and cleft before;<BR>
Nor can you more your right in it maintain.&#8221;<BR>
So saying, he parforce must prove how sore<BR>
The danger and the dint of Durindane;<BR>
Which smites his front, and with such weight withal,<BR>
A mountain lighter than that sword would fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
If cleft his vizor through the midst; &#8217;twas well<BR>
That from the sight diverged the trenchant blade,<BR>
Which on the saddle&#8217;s plated pommel fell;<BR>
Nor yet its double steel the faulchion stayed:<BR>
It reached his armour (like soft wax, the shell<BR>
Oped, and the skirts wherewith &#8217;twas overlaid)<BR>
And trenched upon his thigh a grievous wound;<BR>
So that &#8217;twas long ere he again waxed sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
The spouting blood of either cavalier<BR>
Their arms had crimsoned in a double drain:<BR>
Hence diversly the people guessed, which peer<BR>
Would have the better of the warlike twain:<BR>
But soon Rogero made the matter clear<BR>
With that keen sword, so many a champion&#8217;s bane:<BR>
With this he at that part in fury past<BR>
Whence Mandricardo had his buckler cast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
He the left side of his good cuirass gored,<BR>
And found a passage to the heart below;<BR>
Which a full palm above the flank he bored;<BR>
So that parforce the Tartar must forego<BR>
His every title to the famous sword,<BR>
The blazoned buckler, and its bird of snow,<BR>
And yield, together with these seeds of strife,<BR>
&#8212;Dearer than sword and shield&#8212;his precious life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Not unavenged the unhappy monarch dies;<BR>
For in the very moment he is smit,<BR>
The sword&#8212;for little period his&#8212;he plies,<BR>
And good Rogero&#8217;s vizor would have split.<BR>
But that he stopt the stroke in wary wise,<BR>
And broke its force and vigour ere it lit;<BR>
Its force and vigour broke: for he, below<BR>
The better arm, first smote his Tartar foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Smit was the Child by Mandricardo&#8217;s hand,<BR>
At the same moment he that monarch slew:<BR>
He, albeit thick, divides an iron band<BR>
And good steel cap beneath it; inches two,<BR>
Lies buried in the head the trenchant brand,<BR>
The solid bone and sinew severed through.<BR>
Astound Rogero fell, on earth reversed,<BR>
And from his head a stream of life-blood burst.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Rogero was the first who went to ground,<BR>
And so much longer did the king delay,<BR>
Nigh every one of those who waited round<BR>
Weened he the prize and vaunt had borne away.<BR>
So, erred his Doralice, that oft was drowned<BR>
In tears, and often clad in smiles that day:<BR>
She thanked her God, with hands to Heaven extended,<BR>
That in such wise the fearful fight had ended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
But when by tokens manifest appear<BR>
The live man living and the dead man slain,<BR>
The favourers of those knights, with change of cheer,<BR>
Some weep and some rejoice, an altered train.<BR>
King, lord, and every worthiest cavalier<BR>
Crowd round Rogero, who has risen with pain.<BR>
Him to embrace and gratulate they wend,<BR>
And do him grace and honour without end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Each with Rogero is rejoiced, and feels<BR>
That which he utters in his heart; among<BR>
The crowd the Sericane alone conceals<BR>
Other than what he vouches with his tongue.<BR>
He pleasure in his countenance reveals,<BR>
With envy at the conquest inly stung;<BR>
And&#8212;were his destiny or chance to blame&#8212;<BR>
Curses whiche&#8217;er produced Rogero&#8217;s name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
What of Rogero&#8217;s favour can be said?<BR>
What of caresses, many, true, and kind,<BR>
From Agramant? that not without his aid<BR>
Would have unrolled his ensigns the wind;<BR>
Who had to move from Africk been afraid,<BR>
Nor would have trusted in his host combined.<BR>
He, now King Mandricardo is no more,<BR>
Esteems him the united world before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Nor to Rogero lean the men alone;<BR>
To him incline as well the female train,<BR>
Who for the land of France had left their own,<BR>
Amid the troops of Africk or of Spain;<BR>
And Doralice, herself, although she moan,<BR>
And for her lover, cold and pale, complain,<BR>
Save by the griding curb of shame represt,<BR>
Her voice, perchance, had added to the rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
I say perchance, nor warrant it I dare,<BR>
Albeit the thing may easily be true;<BR>
For such his manners, such his merits are,<BR>
So beauteous is Rogero&#8217;s form to view,<BR>
She (from experience we are well aware)<BR>
So prone to follow whatsoe&#8217;er is new,<BR>
That not to play the widow&#8217;s lovelorn part,<BR>
She on Rogero well might set her heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Though he did well alive, what could be done<BR>
With Mandricardo, after he was dead?<BR>
&#8217;Tis fitting she provide herself with one<BR>
That her, by night or day, may bravely stead.<BR>
Meanwhile to young Rogero&#8217;s succour run<BR>
The king&#8217;s physician in his art best read;<BR>
Who, having seen the fruits of that fell strife,<BR>
Already has ensured Rogero&#8217;s life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Agramant bids them diligently lay<BR>
The wounded warrior in his tent, and there<BR>
Is evermore beside him, night and day;<BR>
Him with such love he watches, with such care:<BR>
To his bed the Tartar&#8217;s arms and buckler gay,<BR>
So bade the Moorish king, suspended were;<BR>
Suspended all, save trenchant Durindana,<BR>
Relinquished to the King of Sericana.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
With Mandricardo&#8217;s arms, his other weed<BR>
Was to Rogero given, and given with these<BR>
Was warlike Brigliador, whom on the mead<BR>
Orlando left, distraught with his disease.<BR>
To Agramant Rogero gave the steed,<BR>
Well knowing how that goodly gift would please.<BR>
No more of this: parforce my strain returns<BR>
To her that vainly for Rogero burns.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Bradamant&#8217;s torment have I to recount,<BR>
While for the courier damsel she did stay:<BR>
With tidings of her love to Alban&#8217;s Mount,<BR>
To her Hippalca measured back her way:<BR>
She of Frontino first and Rodomont,<BR>
And next of good Rogero had to say;<BR>
How to the fount anew he had addrest<BR>
His way, with Richardetto and the rest;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
And how the Child, in rescue of the steed,<BR>
Had gone with her to find the paynim rude;<BR>
And weened to have chastized his foul misdeed,<BR>
That from a woman took Frontino good.<BR>
And how the youth&#8217;s design did ill succeed,<BR>
Because the king had other way pursued.<BR>
The reason too why to Mount Alban&#8217;s hold<BR>
Rogero had not come, at full she told;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
And fully she to Bradamant exprest<BR>
What to excuse himself Rogero said:<BR>
She after drew the letter from her breast,<BR>
Wherewith entrusted she had thither sped:<BR>
With visage which more care than hope confest,<BR>
The paper Bradamant received and read;<BR>
Which, but that she expected to have seen<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s self, more welcome would have been.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
To find herself with written scroll appaid<BR>
In good Rogero&#8217;s place, whom she attends,<BR>
Marred her fair visage; which such fear pourtrayed,<BR>
Despite and sorrow as her bosom rends.<BR>
Ten times the page she kisses, while the maid<BR>
As oft to him who writes her heart commends:<BR>
The tears alone which trickle from her eyes<BR>
Keep it from kindling at her burning sighs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Four times, nay six, she that epistle read,<BR>
And willed moreover that as many more<BR>
The message by that damsel should be said,<BR>
Who word and letter to Mount Alban bore.<BR>
This while unceasing tears the lady shed,<BR>
Nor, I believe, would ever have given o&#8217;er,<BR>
Save by the hope consoled, that she anew<BR>
Should briefly her beloved Rogero view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Rogero&#8217;s word was pledged for his return<BR>
When fifteen days or twenty were gone by:<BR>
So had he after to Hippalca sworn,<BR>
Bidding her boldly on his faith rely.<BR>
&#8220;From accidents that chance at every turn&#8221;<BR>
(Cried Bradamant) &#8220;what warranty have I,<BR>
Alas!&#8212;and such are commonest in war&#8212;<BR>
That none the knight&#8217;s return for ever bar?<BR>

   &#8217;     LXXXII<BR>
&#8220;Alas! alas! Rogero, that above<BR>
Myself hast evermore been prized by me,<BR>
Who would have thought thou more than me could&#8217;st love<BR>
Any, and most thy mortal enemy?<BR>
And harm&#8217;st where thou should&#8217;st help; nor do I see<BR>
If thou as worthy praise or blame regard<BR>
Such tardiness to punish and reward.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I know not if thou knowest&#8212;the stones know&#8212;<BR>
How by Troyano was thy father slain;<BR>
And yet Troyano&#8217;s son, against his foe,<BR>
Thou would&#8217;st defend, and keep from harm or stain<BR>
Such vengeance upon him do&#8217;st thou bestow?<BR>
And do his vengers, as their meed obtain,<BR>
That I, descended of his stock, should be<BR>
The martyr of the mortal cruelty?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
To her Rogero, in his absence, said<BR>
The lady these sad words, and more beside,<BR>
Lamenting aye; while her attendant maid<BR>
Nor once alone, but often, certified<BR>
The stripling would observe his faith, and prayed<BR>
Her&#8212;who could do no better&#8212;to abide<BR>
The Child&#8217;s arrival till the time came round<BR>
When he by promise to return was bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
The comfort that Hippalca&#8217;s words convey,<BR>
And Hope, companion of the loving train,<BR>
Bradamant&#8217;s fear and sorrow so allay,<BR>
That she enjoys some respite from her pain:<BR>
This moves her in Mount Alban&#8217;s keep to stay;<BR>
Nor ever thence that lady stirred again<BR>
Until the day, that day the youthful knight<BR>
Had fixt, who ill observed his promise plight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
But in that he his promise ill maintained,<BR>
No blame upon Rogero should be cast;<BR>
Him one or other cause so long detained,<BR>
The appointed time parforce he overpast:<BR>
On a sick bed, long time, he, sorely pained,<BR>
Was laid, wherein a month or more he past<BR>
In doubt of death; so deeply him had gored<BR>
Erewhile in fight the Tartar monarch&#8217;s sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Him on the day prefixed the maid attended,<BR>
Nor other tidings of the youth had read,<BR>
But those he through Hippalca had commended,<BR>
And that which after Richardetto said;<BR>
Who told how him Rogero had defended,<BR>
And freed the captive pair to prison led.<BR>
The tidings, overjoyed, she hears repeat;<BR>
Yet blended with some bitter is the sweet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
For she had heard as well in that discourse,<BR>
For might and beauty voiced, Marphisa&#8217;s praise;<BR>
Heard, how Rogero thither bends his course,<BR>
Together with that lady, as he says,<BR>
Where in weak post and with unequal force<BR>
King Agramant the Christian army stays.<BR>
Such fair companionship the lady lauds,<BR>
But neither likes that union nor applauds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Nor light suspicion has she of that queen:<BR>
For, were Marphisa beauteous, as was said,<BR>
And they together till that time had been,<BR>
&#8217;T were marvel but Rogero loved the maid:<BR>
Yet would she not believe; but hung between<BR>
Her hopes and fears, and in Mount Alban stayed;<BR>
And close and anxious there, until the day<BR>
Which was to bring her joy or sorrow, lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
This while Mount Alban&#8217;s prince and castellain,<BR>
Rinaldo, first of that fair brotherhood,<BR>
&#8212;I say in honour, not in age, for twain<BR>
In right of birth before the warrior stood,<BR>
Who&#8212;as the sun illumes the starry train&#8212;<BR>
Had by his deeds ennobled Aymon&#8217;s blood,<BR>
One day at noon, with none beside a page<BR>
To serve him, reached that famous fortilage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Hither had good Rinaldo now repaired;<BR>
Because returning Paris ward again,<BR>
From Brava, (whither had he often fared,<BR>
As said, to seek Angelica in vain)<BR>
He of that pair those evil news had heard.<BR>
His Malagigi and his Viviane,<BR>
How they were to Maganza to be sent;<BR>
And hence to Agrismont his way had bent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
There, hearing of the safety of that pair,<BR>
And of their enemies&#8217; defeat and fall;<BR>
And how Rogero and Marphisa were<BR>
The authors of their ruin; and how all<BR>
His valiant brethren and his cousins are<BR>
Returned, and harboured in Mount Alban&#8217;s hall,<BR>
Until he there embrace the friendly throng<BR>
Each hour appears to him a twelvemonth long.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
His course to Mont Albano had he ta&#8217;en;<BR>
And, there embracing wife and children dear,<BR>
Mother and brethren and the cousins twain,<BR>
(They who were captives to their foe whilere)<BR>
A parent swallow seems, amid that train,<BR>
Which, with full beak, its fasting youth doth cheer.<BR>
With them a day or more the warrior stayed,<BR>
Then issued forth and others thence conveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Guichard, Duke Aymon&#8217;s eldest born, and they,<BR>
Richard, Alardo, and Richardet&#8217; combined,<BR>
Vivian and Malagigi, wend their way<BR>
In arms, the martial paladin behind.<BR>
Bradamant, waiting the appointed day,<BR>
Which she, in her desire, too slow opined,<BR>
Feigned herself ailing to the brethren true,<BR>
Nor would she join in arms the banded crew;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
And, saying that she ailed, most truly said;<BR>
Yet &#8217;twas not corporal pain or fever sore,<BR>
It was Desire that on her spirit preyed,<BR>
Diseased with Love&#8217;s disastrous fit: no more<BR>
Rinaldo in Mount Alban&#8217;s castle stayed:<BR>
With him his kinsman&#8217;s flower the warrior bore.<BR>
How he for Paris journeyed, and how well<BR>
He succoured Charles, shall other canto tell.</TD></TR>
