<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Ariodantes has, a worthy meed,<BR>
With his loved bride, the fief of Albany.<BR>
Meantime Rogero, on the flying steed,<BR>
Arrives in false Alcina&#8217;s empery:<BR>
There from a myrtle-tree her every deed,<BR>
A human myrtle hears, and treachery,<BR>
And thence would go; but they who first withdrew<BR>
Him from one strife, engage him in a new.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
W<SMALL>RETCHED</SMALL> that evil man who lives in trust<BR>
His secret sin is safe in his possession!<BR>
Since, if nought else, the air, the very dust<BR>
In which the crime is buried, makes confession,<BR>
And oftentimes his guilt compels the unjust,<BR>
Though sometime unarraigned in worldly session,<BR>
To be his own accuser, and bewray,<BR>
So God has willed, deeds hidden from the day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
The unhappy Polinesso hopes had nursed,<BR>
Wholly his secret treason to conceal.<BR>
By taking off Dalinda, who was versed<BR>
In this, and only could the fact reveal;<BR>
And adding thus a second to his first<BR>
Offence, but hurried on the dread appeal,<BR>
Which haply he had stunned, at least deferred;<BR>
But he to self-destruction blindly spurred.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
And forfeited estate, and life, and love<BR>
Of friends at once, and honour, which was more.<BR>
The cavalier unknown, I said above,<BR>
Long of the king and court entreated sore,<BR>
At length the covering helmet did remove,<BR>
And showed a visage often seen before,<BR>
The cherished face of Ariodantes true,<BR>
Of late lamented weeping Scotland through;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Ariodantes, whom with tearful eye<BR>
His brother and Geneura wept as dead,<BR>
And king, and people, and nobility:<BR>
Such light his goodness and his valour shed.<BR>
The pilgrim therefore might appear to lie<BR>
In what he of the missing warrior said.<BR>
Yet was it true that from a headland, he<BR>
Had seen him plunge into the foaming sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
But, as it oft befalls despairing wight,<BR>
Who grisly Death desires till he appear;<BR>
But loathes what he had sought, on nearer sight;<BR>
So painful seems the cruel pass and drear.<BR>
Thus, in the sea engulphed, the wretched knight,<BR>
Repentant of his deed, was touched with fear;<BR>
And, matchless both for spirit and for hand,<BR>
Beat back the billows, and returned to land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
And, now despising, as of folly bred,<BR>
The fond desire which did to death impell,<BR>
Thence, soaked and dripping wet, his way did tread,<BR>
And halted at a hermit&#8217;s humble cell:<BR>
And housed within the holy father&#8217;s shed,<BR>
There secretly awhile designed to dwell;<BR>
Till to his ears by rumour should be voiced,<BR>
If his Geneura sorrowed or rejoiced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
At first he heard that, through excess of woe,<BR>
The miserable damsel well-nigh died:<BR>
For so abroad the doleful tidings go,<BR>
&#8217;Twas talked of in the island, far and wide:<BR>
Far other proof than that deceitful show,<BR>
Which to his cruel grief he thought he spied!<BR>
And next against the fair Geneura heard<BR>
Lurcanio to her sire his charge preferred:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Nor for his brother felt less enmity<BR>
Than was the love he lately bore the maid;<BR>
For he too foul, and full of cruelty,<BR>
Esteemed the deed, although for him essayed;<BR>
And, hearing after, in her jeopardy,<BR>
That none appeared to lend the damsel aid,<BR>
Because so puissant was Lurcanio&#8217;s might,<BR>
All dreaded an encounter with the knight,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
And that who well the youthful champion knew,<BR>
Believed he was so wary and discreet,<BR>
That, had what he related been untrue,<BR>
He never would have risqued so rash a feat,<BR>
&#8212;For this the greater part the fight eschew,<BR>
Fearing in wrongful cause the knight to meet&#8212;<BR>
Ariodantes (long his doubts are weighed)<BR>
Will meet his brother in Geneura&#8217;s aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alas! (he said) I cannot bear to see<BR>
Thus by my cause the royal damsel die;<BR>
My death too bitter and too dread would be,<BR>
Did I, before my own, her death descry:<BR>
For still my lady, my divinity<BR>
She is;&#8212;the light and comfort of my eye.<BR>
Her, right or wrong, I cannot choose but shield,<BR>
And for her safety perish in the field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I know I choose the wrong, and be it so!<BR>
And in the cause shall die: nor this would move;<BR>
But that, alas! my death, as well I know,<BR>
Will such a lovely dame&#8217;s destruction prove,<BR>
To death I with one only comfort go,<BR>
That, if her Polinesso bears her love,<BR>
To her will manifestly be displayed,<BR>
That hitherto he moves not in her aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And me, so wronged by her, the maid shall view<BR>
Encounter death in her defence; and he,<BR>
My brother, who such flames of discord blew,<BR>
Shall pay the debt of vengeance due to me.<BR>
For well I ween to make Lurcanio rue<BR>
(Informed of the event) his cruelty,<BR>
Who will have thought to venge me with his brand,<BR>
And will have slain me with his very hand.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
He, having this concluded in his thought,<BR>
Made new provision of arms, steed, and shield;<BR>
Black was the vest and buckler which he bought,<BR>
Where green and yellow striped the sable field:<BR>
By hazard found, with him a squire he brought,<BR>
A stranger in that country; and, concealed<BR>
(As is already told) the unhappy knight,<BR>
Against his brother came, prepared for fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
And yielding to his natural inclination,<BR>
And at the suit of all his court beside,<BR>
And mostly at Rinaldo&#8217;s instigation,<BR>
Assigned the youth the damsel as his bride.<BR>
Albany&#8217;s duchy, now in sequestration,<BR>
Late Polinesso&#8217;s, who in duel died,<BR>
Could not be forfeited in happier hour;<BR>
Since this the monarch made his daughter&#8217;s dower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo for Dalinda mercy won;<BR>
Who from her fault&#8217;s due punishment went free.<BR>
She, satiate of the world, (and this to shun,<BR>
The damsel so had vowed) to God will flee:<BR>
And hence, in Denmark&#8217;s land, to live a nun,<BR>
Straight from her native Scotland sailed the sea.<BR>
But it is time Rogero to pursue,<BR>
Who on his courser posts the welkin through.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Although Rogero is of constant mind,<BR>
Not from his cheek the wonted hues depart.<BR>
I ween that faster than a leaf i&#8217; the wind<BR>
Fluttered within his breast the stripling&#8217;s heart.<BR>
All Europe&#8217;s region he had left behind<BR>
In his swift course; and, issuing in that part,<BR>
Passed by a mighty space, the southern sound<BR>
Where great Alcides fixed the sailor&#8217;s bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
That hippogryph, huge fowl, and strange to sight,<BR>
Bears off the warrior with such rapid wing,<BR>
He would have distanced, in his airy flight,<BR>
The thunder bearing bird of &AElig;ther&#8217;s king:<BR>
Nor other living creature soars such height,<BR>
Him in his mighty swiftness equalling.<BR>
I scarce believe that bolt, or lightning flies,<BR>
Or darts more swiftly from the parted skies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
When the huge bird his pinions long had plied,<BR>
In a straight line, without one stoop or bend,<BR>
He, tired of air, with sweeping wheel and wide,<BR>
Began upon an island to descend;<BR>
Like that fair region, whither, long unspied<BR>
Of him, her wayward mood did long offend,<BR>
Whilom in vain, through strange and secret sluice,<BR>
Passed under sea the Virgin Arethuse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
A more delightful place, wherever hurled<BR>
Through the whole air, Rogero had not found:<BR>
And, had he ranged the universal world,<BR>
Would not have seen a lovelier in his round,<BR>
Than that, where, wheeling wide, the courser furled<BR>
His spreading wings, and lighted on the ground,<BR>
&#8217;Mid cultivated plain, delicious hill,<BR>
Moist meadow, shady bank, and crystal rill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Small thickets, with the scented laurel gay,<BR>
Cedar, and orange, full of fruit and flower,<BR>
Myrtle and palm, with interwoven spray,<BR>
Pleached in mixed modes, all lovely, form a bower;<BR>
And, breaking with their shade the scorching ray,<BR>
Make a cool shelter from the noontide hour.<BR>
And nightingales among those branches wing<BR>
Their flight, and safely amorous descants sing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Amid red roses and white lilies there,<BR>
Which the soft breezes freshen as they fly,<BR>
Secure the cony haunts, and timid hare,<BR>
And stag, with branching forehead broad and high.<BR>
These, fearless of the hunter&#8217;s dart or snare,<BR>
Feed at their ease, or ruminating lie;<BR>
While, swarming in those wilds, from tuft or steep<BR>
Dun deer or nimble goat, disporting, leap.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
When the hyppogryph above the island hung,<BR>
And had approached so nigh that landscape fair,<BR>
That, if his rider from the saddle sprung,<BR>
He might the leap with little danger dare,<BR>
Rogero lit the grass and flowers among,<BR>
But held him, lest he should remount the air;<BR>
And to a myrtle, nigh the rolling brine,<BR>
Made fast, between a bay-tree and a pine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
And there, close-by where rose a bubbling fount,<BR>
Begirt the fertile palm and cedar-tree,<BR>
He drops the shield, the helmet from his front<BR>
Uplifts, and, either hand from gauntlet free,<BR>
Now turning to the beach, and now the mount,<BR>
Catches the gales which blow from hill or sea,<BR>
And, with a joyous murmur, lightly stir<BR>
The lofty top of beech, or feathery fir:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
And, now, to bathe his burning lips he strains;<BR>
Now dabbles in the crystal wave, to chase<BR>
The scorching heat which rages in his veins,<BR>
Caught from the heavy corslet&#8217;s burning case.<BR>
Nor is it marvel if the burden pains;<BR>
No ramble his in square or market-place!<BR>
Three thousand miles, without repose, he went,<BR>
And still, at speed, in ponderous armour pent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile the courser by the myrtle&#8217;s side,<BR>
Whom he left stabled in the cool retreat,<BR>
Started at something in the wood descried,<BR>
Scared by I know not what; and in his heat<BR>
So made the myrtle shake where he was tied,<BR>
He brought a shower of leaves about his feet;<BR>
He made the myrtle shake and foliage fall,<BR>
But, struggling, could not loose himself withal.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
As in a stick to feed the chimney rent,<BR>
Where scanty pith ill fills the narrow sheath,<BR>
The vapour, in its little channel pent,<BR>
Struggles, tormented by the fire beneath;<BR>
And, till its prisoned fury find a vent,<BR>
Is heard to hiss and bubble, sing and seethe:<BR>
So the offended myrtle inly pined,<BR>
Groaned, murmured, and at last unclosed its rind:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
And hence a clear, intelligible speech<BR>
Thus issued, with a melancholy sound;<BR>
&#8220;If, as thy cheer and gentle presence teach,<BR>
Thou courteous art and good, his reign unbound,<BR>
Release me from this monster, I beseech:<BR>
Griefs of my own inflict sufficient wound:<BR>
Nor need I, compassed with such ills about,<BR>
Other new pain to plague me from without.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
At the first sound, Rogero turns to see<BR>
Whence came the voice, and, in unused surprise,<BR>
Stands, when he finds it issues from the tree;<BR>
And swiftly to remove the courser hies.<BR>
Then, with a face suffused with crimson, he<BR>
In answer to the groaning myrtle, cries;<BR>
&#8220;Pardon! and, whatsoe&#8217;er thou art, be good,<BR>
Spirit of man, or goddess of the wood!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Unweeting of the wonderous prodigy<BR>
Of spirit, pent beneath the knotty rind,<BR>
To your fair leaf and living body I<BR>
Have done this scathe and outrage undesigned.<BR>
But not the less for that, to me reply,<BR>
What art thou, who, in rugged case confined,<BR>
Dost live and speak? And so may never hail<BR>
From angry heaven your gentle boughs assail!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if I now or ever the despite<BR>
I did thee can repair, or aid impart,<BR>
I, by that lady dear, my promise plight,<BR>
Who in her keeping has my better part,<BR>
To strive with word and deed, till thou requite<BR>
The service done with praise and grateful heart.&#8221;<BR>
Rogero said; and, as he closed his suit,<BR>
That gentle myrtle shook from top to root.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Next drops were seen to stand upon the bark,<BR>
As juice is sweated by the sapling-spray,<BR>
New-severed, when it yields to flame and spark,<BR>
Sometime in vain kept back and held at bay.<BR>
And next the voice began: &#8220;My story dark,<BR>
Forced by thy courteous deed, I shall display;&#8212;<BR>
What once I was&#8212;by whom, through magic lore,<BR>
Changed to a myrtle on the pleasant shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A peer of France, Astolpho was my name,<BR>
Whilom a paladin, sore feared in fight;<BR>
Cousin I was to two of boundless fame,<BR>
Orlando and Rinaldo. I by right<BR>
Looked to all England&#8217;s crown; my lawful claim<BR>
After my royal father, Otho hight.<BR>
More dames than one my beauty served to warm,<BR>
And in conclusion wrought my single harm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Returning from those isles, whose eastern side<BR>
The billows of the Indian ocean beat,<BR>
Where good Rinaldo and more knights beside<BR>
With me were pent in dark and hollow seat,<BR>
Thence, rescued by illustrious Brava&#8217;s pride,<BR>
Whose prowess freed us from that dark retreat,<BR>
Westward I fared along the sandy shores,<BR>
On which the stormy north his fury pours.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Pursuing thus our rugged journey, we<BR>
Came (such our evil doom) upon the strand,<BR>
Where stood a mansion seated by the sea:<BR>
Puissant Alcina owned the house and land.<BR>
We found her, where, without her dwelling, she<BR>
Had taken on the beach her lonely stand;<BR>
And though nor hook nor sweeping net she bore,<BR>
What fish she willed, at pleasure drew to shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thither swift dolphins gambol, inly stirred,<BR>
And open-mouthed the cumbrous tunnies leap;<BR>
Thither the seal or porpus&#8217; wallowing herd<BR>
Troop at her bidding, roused from lazy sleep;<BR>
Raven-fish, salmon, salpouth, at her word,<BR>
And mullet hurry through the briny deep,<BR>
With monstrous backs above the water, sail<BR>
Ork, physeter, sea-serpent, shark, and whale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;There we behold a mighty whale, of size<BR>
The hugest yet in any water seen:<BR>
More than eleven paces, to our eyes,<BR>
His back appears above the surface green:<BR>
And (for still firm and motionless he lies,<BR>
And such the distance his two ends between)<BR>
We all are cheated by the floating pile,<BR>
And idly take the monster for an isle.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alcina made the ready fish obey<BR>
By simple words and by mere magic lore:<BR>
Born with Morgana&#8212;but I cannot say<BR>
If at one birth, or after or before.<BR>
As soon as seen, my aspect pleased the fay;<BR>
Who showed it in the countenance she wore:<BR>
Then wrought with art, and compassed her intent,<BR>
To part me from the friends with whom I went.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She came towards us with a cheerful face,<BR>
With graceful gestures, and a courteous air,<BR>
And said: &#8216;So you my lodging please to grace,<BR>
Sir cavalier, and will with me repair,<BR>
You shall behold the wonders of my chace,<BR>
And note the different sorts of fish I snare;<BR>
Shaggy or smooth, or clad in scales of light,<BR>
And more in number than the stars of night:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And would you hear a mermaid sing so sweet,<BR>
That the rude sea grows civil at her song,<BR>
Wont at this hour her music to repeat,<BR>
(With that she showed the monster huge and long<BR>
&#8212;I said it seemed an island&#8212;as her seat)<BR>
Pass with me where she sings the shoals among.&#8217;<BR>
I, that was always wilful, at her wish,<BR>
I now lament my rashness, climb the fish.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To Dudon and Rinaldo&#8217;s signal blind,<BR>
I go, who warn me to misdoubt the fay.<BR>
With laughing face Alcina mounts behind,<BR>
Leaving the other two beside the bay.<BR>
The obedient fish performs the task assigned,<BR>
And through the yielding water works his way.<BR>
Repentant of my deed, I curse the snare,<BR>
Too far from land my folly to repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To aid me swam Mount Alban&#8217;s cavalier,<BR>
And was nigh drowned amid the waves that rise;<BR>
For a south-wind sprang up that, far and near,<BR>
Covered with sudden darkness seas and skies.<BR>
I know not after what befel the peer:<BR>
This while Alcina to console me tries,<BR>
And all that day, and night which followed, me<BR>
Detained upon that monster in mid-sea,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Till to this isle we drifted with the morn,<BR>
Of which Alcina keeps a mighty share;<BR>
By that usurper from a sister torn,<BR>
Who was her father&#8217;s universal heir:<BR>
For that she only was in wedlock born,<BR>
And for those other two false sisters were<BR>
(So well-instructed in the story, said<BR>
One who rehearsed the tale) in incest bred.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As these are practised in iniquity,<BR>
And full of every vice and evil art;<BR>
So she, who ever lives in chastity,<BR>
Wisely on better things has set her heart.<BR>
Hence, leagued against her, in conspiracy,<BR>
Those others are, to drive her from her part:<BR>
And more than once their armies have o&#8217;errun<BR>
Her realm, and towns above a hundred won.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor at this hour a single span of ground<BR>
Would Logistilla (such her name) command,<BR>
But that a mountain here, and there a sound,<BR>
Protects the remnant from the invading band.<BR>
&#8217;Tis thus the mountain and the river bound<BR>
England, and part it from the Scottish land.<BR>
Yet will the sisters give their foe no rest,<BR>
Till of her scanty remnant dispossest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Because in wickedness and vice were bred<BR>
The pair, as chaste and good they loath the dame.<BR>
But, to return to what I lately said,<BR>
And to relate how I a plant became;<BR>
Me, full of love, the kind Alcina fed<BR>
With full delights; nor I a weaker flame<BR>
For her, within my burning heart did bear,<BR>
Beholding her so courteous and so fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Clasped in her dainty limbs, and lapt in pleasure,<BR>
I weened that I each separate good had won,<BR>
Which to mankind is dealt in different measure,<BR>
Little or more to some, and much to none.<BR>
I evermore contemplated my treasure,<BR>
Nor France nor aught beside I thought upon:<BR>
In her my every fancy, every hope<BR>
Centered and ended as their common scope.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By her I was as much beloved, or more;<BR>
Nor did Alcina now for other care;<BR>
She left her every lover; for before,<BR>
Others, in truth, the fairy&#8217;s love did share:<BR>
I was her close adviser evermore;<BR>
And served by her, where they commanded were.<BR>
With me she counselled, and to me referred;<BR>
Nor, night nor day, to other spake a word.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Why touch my wounds, to aggravate my ill,<BR>
And that, alas! without the hope of cure?<BR>
Why thus the good possessed remember still,<BR>
Amid the cruel penance I endure?<BR>
When kindest I believed Alcina&#8217;s will,<BR>
And fondly deemed my happiness secure,<BR>
From me the heart she gave, the fay withdrew,<BR>
And yielded all her soul to love more new.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Late I discerned her light and fickle bent,<BR>
Still loving and unloving at a heat:<BR>
Two months, I reigned not more, no sooner spent,<BR>
Than a new paramour assumed my seat;<BR>
And me, with scorn, she doomed to banishment,<BR>
From her fair grace cast out. &#8217;Tis then I weet<BR>
I share a thousand lovers&#8217; fate, whom she<BR>
Had to like pass reduced, all wrongfully.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And these, because they should not scatter bruits,<BR>
Roaming the world, of her lascivious ways,<BR>
She, up and down the fruitful soil, transmutes<BR>
To olive, palm, or cedar, firs or bays.<BR>
These, as you see me changed, Alcina roots;<BR>
While this transformed into a monster strays;<BR>
Another melts into a liquid rill;<BR>
As suits that haughty fairy&#8217;s wanton will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou, too, that to this fatal isle art led<BR>
By way unwonted and till now unknown,<BR>
That some possessor of the fairy&#8217;s bed,<BR>
May be for thee transformed to wave or stone,<BR>
Thou shalt, with more than mortal pleasures fed,<BR>
Have from Alcina seigniory and throne;<BR>
But shalt be sure to join the common flock,<BR>
Transformed to beast or fountain, plant or rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I willingly to thee this truth impart,<BR>
Not that I hope with profit to advise:<BR>
Yet &#8217;twill be better, that informed, in part,<BR>
Of her false ways, she harm not by surprise.<BR>
Perhaps, as faces differ, and in art<BR>
And wit of man an equal difference lies,<BR>
Thou may&#8217;st some remedy perchance apply<BR>
To the ill, which thousand others could not fly.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
The good Rogero, who from Fame had learned<BR>
That he was cousin to the dame he wooed,<BR>
Lamented much the sad Astolpho, turned<BR>
From his true form, to barren plant and rude:<BR>
And for her love, for whom so sore he burned,<BR>
Would gladly serve the stripling if he cou&#8217;d:<BR>
But, witless how to give the wished relief,<BR>
Might but console the unhappy warrior&#8217;s grief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
As best he could, he strove to soothe his pain;<BR>
Then asked him, if to Logistil&#8217;s retreat<BR>
Were passage, whether over hill or plain;<BR>
That he might so eschew Alcina&#8217;s seat.<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;There was a way&#8217;, the myrtle said again,<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;But rough with stones, and rugged to the feet&#8212;<BR>
If he, some little further to the right,<BR>
Would scale the Alpine mountain&#8217;s very height:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8216;But that he must not think he shall pursue<BR>
The intended journey far; since by the way<BR>
He will encounter with a frequent crew,<BR>
And fierce, who serve as rampart to the fay,<BR>
That block the road against the stranger, who<BR>
Would break her bounds, and the deserter stay.&#8217;<BR>
Rogero thanked the tree for all, and taught,<BR>
Departed thence with full instructions fraught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
The courser from the myrtle he untied,<BR>
And by the bridle led behind him still;<BR>
Nor would he, as before, the horse bestride,<BR>
Lest he should bear him off against his will:<BR>
He mused this while how safely he might find<BR>
A passage to the land of Logistil;<BR>
Firm in his purpose every nerve to strain,<BR>
Lest empire over him Alcina gain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
He to remount the steed, and through the air<BR>
To spur him to a new career again<BR>
Now thought; but doubted next, in fear to fare<BR>
Worse on the courser, restive to the rein.<BR>
&#8220;No, I will win by force the mountain stair,&#8221;<BR>
Rogero said; (but the resolve was vain)<BR>
Nor by the beach two miles his way pursued,<BR>
Ere he Alcina&#8217;s lovely city viewed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
A lofty wall at distance meets his eye<BR>
Which girds a spacious town within its bound;<BR>
It seems as if its summit touched the sky,<BR>
And all appears like gold from top to ground.<BR>
Here some one says it is but alchemy<BR>
&#8212;And haply his opinion is unsound&#8212;<BR>
And haply he more wittily divines:<BR>
For me, I deem it gold because it shines.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
When he was nigh the city-walls, so bright,<BR>
The world has not their equal, he the straight<BR>
And spacious way deserts, the way which dight<BR>
Across the plain, conducted to the gate;<BR>
And by that safer road upon the right,<BR>
Strains now against the mountain; but, in wait,<BR>
Encounters soon the crowd of evil foes,<BR>
Who furiously the Child&#8217;s advance oppose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Was never yet beheld a stranger band,<BR>
Of mien more hideous, or more monstrous shape.<BR>
Formed downwards from neck like men, he scanned<BR>
Some with the head of cat, and some of ape;<BR>
With hoof of goat that other stamped the sand;<BR>
While some seemed centaurs, quick in fight and rape;<BR>
Naked, or mantled in outlandish skin.<BR>
These doting sires, those striplings bold in sin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
This gallops on a horse without a bit;<BR>
This backs the sluggish ass, or bullock slow;<BR>
These mounted on the croup of centaur sit:<BR>
Those perched on eagle, crane, or estridge, go.<BR>
Some male, some female, some hermaphrodit&#8217;,<BR>
These drain the cup and those the bungle blow.<BR>
One bore a corded ladder, one a hook,<BR>
One a dull file, or bar of iron shook.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
The captain of this crew, which blocked the road,<BR>
Appeared, with monstrous paunch and bloated face;<BR>
Who a slow tortoise for a horse bestrode,<BR>
That passing sluggishly with him did pace:<BR>
Down looked, some here, some there, sustained the load,<BR>
For he was drunk, and kept him in his place.<BR>
Some wipe his brows and chin from sweat which ran,<BR>
And others with their vests his visage fan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
One, with a human shape and feet, his crest,<BR>
Fashioned like hound, in neck and ears and head,<BR>
Bayed at the gallant Child with angry quest,<BR>
To turn him to the city whence he fled.<BR>
&#8220;That will I never, while of strength possessed<BR>
To brandish this,&#8221; the good Rogero said:<BR>
With that his trenchant faulchion he displayed,<BR>
And pointed at him full the naked blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
That monster would have smote him with a spear,<BR>
But swiftly at his foe Rogero sprung,<BR>
Thrust at his paunch, and drove his faulchion sheer<BR>
Through his pierced back a palm; his buckler flung<BR>
Before him, and next sallied there and here:<BR>
But all too numerous was the wicked throng.<BR>
Now grappled from behind, now punched before,<BR>
He stands, and plies the crowd with warfare sore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
One to the teeth, another to the breast,<BR>
Of that foul race he cleft; since no one steeled<BR>
In mail, his brows with covering helmet dressed,<BR>
Or fought, secured by corslet or by shield;<BR>
Yet is he so upon all quarters pressed,<BR>
That it would need the Child, to clear the field,<BR>
And to keep off the wicked crew which swarms,<BR>
More than Briareus&#8217; hundred hands and arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
If he had thought the magic shield to show,<BR>
(I speak of that the necromancer bore,<BR>
Which dazed the sight of the astonished foe,<BR>
Left at his saddle by the wizard Moor)<BR>
That hideous band, in sudden overthrow,<BR>
Blinded by this, had sunk the knight before.<BR>
But haply he despised such mean as vile,<BR>
And would prevail by valour, not by guile.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
This as it may: the Child would meet his fate,<BR>
Ere by so vile a band be prisoner led;<BR>
When, lo! forth-issuing from the city&#8217;s gate,<BR>
Whose wall appeared like shining gold I said,<BR>
Two youthful dames, not born in low estate,<BR>
If measured by their mien and garb, nor bred<BR>
By swain, in early wants and troubles versed;<BR>
But amid princely joys in palace nursed!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
On unicorn was seated either fair,<BR>
A beast than spotless ermine yet more white;<BR>
So lovely were the damsels, and so rare<BR>
Their garb, and with such graceful fashion dight,<BR>
That he who closely viewed the youthful pair,<BR>
Would need a surer sense than mortal sight,<BR>
To judge between the two. With such a mien<BR>
Embodied Grace and Beauty would be seen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Into the mead rode this and the other dame,<BR>
Where the foul crew opposed the Child&#8217;s retreat.<BR>
The rabble scattered as the ladies came,<BR>
Who with extended hand the warrior greet.<BR>
He, with a kindling visage, red with shame,<BR>
Thanked the two damsels for their gentle feat;<BR>
And was content upon their will to wait,<BR>
With them returning to that golden gate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Above, a cornice round the gateway goes,<BR>
Somedeal projecting from the colonnade,<BR>
In which is not a single part but glows,<BR>
With rarest gems of India overlaid.<BR>
Propp&#8217;d at four points, the portal did repose<BR>
On columns of one solid diamond made.<BR>
Whether what met the eye was false or true,<BR>
Was never sight more fair or glad to view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Upon the sill and through the columns there,<BR>
Ran young and wanton girls, in frolic sport;<BR>
Who haply yet would have appeared more fair,<BR>
Had they observed a woman&#8217;s fitting port.<BR>
All are arrayed in green, and garlands wear<BR>
Of the fresh leaf. Him these in courteous sort,<BR>
With many proffers and fair mien entice,<BR>
And welcome to this opening Paradise:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
For so with reason I this place may call,<BR>
Where, it is my belief, that Love had birth;<BR>
Where life is spent in festive game and ball,<BR>
And still the passing moments fleet in mirth.<BR>
Here hoary-headed Thought ne&#8217;er comes at all,<BR>
Nor finds a place in any bosom. Dearth,<BR>
Nor yet Discomfort, never enter here,<BR>
Where Plenty fills her horn throughout the year.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Here, where with jovial and unclouded brow,<BR>
Glad April seems to wear a constant smile,<BR>
Troop boys and damsels: One, whose fountains flow,<BR>
On the green margin sings in dulcet style;<BR>
Others, the hill or tufted tree below,<BR>
In dance, or no mean sport the hours beguile.<BR>
While this, who shuns the revellers&#8217; noisy cheer,<BR>
Tells his love sorrows in his comrade&#8217;s ear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Above the laurel and pine-tree&#8217;s height,<BR>
Through the tall beech and shaggy fir-tree&#8217;s spray,<BR>
Sport little loves, with desultory flight:<BR>
These, at their conquests made, rejoiced and gay:<BR>
These, with the well-directed shaft, take sight<BR>
At hearts, and those spread nets to catch their prey:<BR>
One wets his arrows in the brook which winds,<BR>
And one on whirling stone the weapon grinds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
To good Rogero here was brought a steed,<BR>
Puissant and nimble, all of sorel hue;<BR>
Who was caparisoned with costly weed,<BR>
Broidered with gold, and jewels bright to view.<BR>
That other winged horse, which, at his need,<BR>
Obedient to the Moorish wizard flew,<BR>
The friendly damsels to a youth consigned,<BR>
Who led him at a slower pace behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
That kindly pair who, by the wicked band<BR>
Offended fate, had saved the youthful knight;<BR>
The wicked crew, that did the Child withstand,<BR>
When he the road had taken on his right,<BR>
Exclaimed, &#8220;Fair sir, your works already scanned<BR>
By us, who are instructed of your might,<BR>
Embolden us, in our behalf, to pray<BR>
You will the prowess of your arm assay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;We soon shall reach a bottom which divides<BR>
The plain into two parts: A cruel dame<BR>
A bridge maintains, which there a stream bestrides,<BR>
Eriphila the savage beldam&#8217;s name;<BR>
Who cheats, and robs, and scathes, whoever rides<BR>
To the other shore, a giantess in frame;<BR>
Who has long poisonous teeth her prey to tear,<BR>
And scratches with her talons like a bear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Besides that she infests the public way,<BR>
Which else were free; she often ranging through<BR>
All this fair garden, puts in disarray<BR>
This thing or that. Of the assassin crew,<BR>
That people who without the portal gay,<BR>
Lately with brutal rage assaulted you,<BR>
Many her sons, the whole her followers call,<BR>
As greedy and inhospitable all.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For you not only her I would assail,<BR>
But do a hundred battles, well content;<BR>
Then of my person, where it may avail,<BR>
Dispose (Rogero said) to you intent.<BR>
Silver and land to conquer, plate or mail<BR>
I swear not, I, in warlike cuirass pent;<BR>
But to afford my aid to others due;<BR>
And, most of all, to beauteous dames like you.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Their grateful thanks the ladies, worthily<BR>
Bestowed on such a valiant champion, paid:<BR>
They talking thus the bridge and river see,<BR>
And at her post the haughty dame arraid<BR>
(Sapphire and emerald decked the panoply)<BR>
In arms of gold: but I awhile delay<BR>
Till other strain the issue of the fray.</TD></TR>
