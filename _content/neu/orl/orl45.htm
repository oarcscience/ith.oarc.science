<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Young Leo doth from death Rogero free;<BR>
For him Rogero Bradamant hath won,<BR>
Making that maid appear less strong to be,<BR>
Disguised in fight like Leo; and, that done,<BR>
Straight in despite would slay himself; so he<BR>
By sorrow, so by anguish is foredone.<BR>
To hinder Leo of his destined wife<BR>
Marphisa works, and kindles mighty strife.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
By how much higher we see poor mortal go<BR>
On Fortune&#8217;s wheel, which runs a restless round,<BR>
We so much sooner see his head below<BR>
His heels; and he is prostrate on the ground.<BR>
The Lydian, Syracusan, Samian show<BR>
This truth, and more whose names I shall not sound;<BR>
All into deepest dolour in one day<BR>
Hurled headlong from the height of sovereign sway.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
By how much more deprest on the other side,<BR>
By how much more the wretch is downwards hurled,<BR>
He so much sooner mounts, where he shall ride,<BR>
If the revolving wheel again be twirled.<BR>
Some on the murderous block have well-nigh died,<BR>
That on the following day have ruled the world.<BR>
Ventidius, Servius, Marius this have shown<BR>
In ancient days; King Lewis in our own;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
King Lewis, stepfather of my duke&#8217;s son;<BR>
Who, when his host at Santalbino fled,<BR>
Left in his clutch by whom that field was won,<BR>
Was nigh remaining shorter by the head.<BR>
Nor long before the great Corvinus run<BR>
A yet more fearful peril, worse bested:<BR>
Both throned, when overblown was their mischance,<BR>
One king of Hungary, one king of France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis plain to sight, through instances that fill<BR>
The page of ancient and of modern story,<BR>
That ill succeeds to good, and good to ill;<BR>
That glory ends in shame, and shame in glory;<BR>
And that man should not trust, deluded still,<BR>
In riches, realm, or field of battle, gory<BR>
With hostile blood, nor yet despair, for spurns<BR>
Of Fortune; since her wheel for ever turns.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Through that fair victory, when overthrown<BR>
Were Leo and his royal sire, the knight<BR>
Who won that battle to such trust is grown,<BR>
In his good fortune and his peerless might,<BR>
He, without following, without aid, alone<BR>
(So is he prompted by his daring sprite)<BR>
Thinks, mid a thousand squadrons in array,<BR>
&#8212;Footmen and horsemen&#8212;sire and son to slay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
But she, that wills no trust shall e&#8217;er be placed<BR>
In her by man, to him doth shortly show,<BR>
How wight by her is raised, and how abased;<BR>
How soon she is a friend, how soon a foe;<BR>
She makes him know Rogero, that in haste<BR>
Is gone to work that warrior shame and woe;<BR>
The cavalier, which in that battle dread<BR>
With much ado had from his faulchion fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
He to Ungiardo hastens to declare<BR>
The Child who put the imperial host to flight,<BR>
Whose carnage many years will not repair,<BR>
Here past the day and was to pass the night;<BR>
And saith, that Fortune, taken by the hair,<BR>
Without more trouble, and without more fight,<BR>
Will, if he prisons him, the Bulgars bring<BR>
Beneath the yoke and lordship of his king.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Ungiardo from the crowd, which had pursued<BR>
Thither their flight from the ensanguined plain,<BR>
For, troop by troop, a countless multitude<BR>
(Arrived, because not all the bridge could gain)<BR>
Knew what a cruel slaughter had ensued:<BR>
For there the moiety of the Greeks was slain;<BR>
And knew that by a cavalier alone<BR>
One host was saved, and one was overthrown;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
And that undriven he should have made his way<BR>
Into the net, and of his own accord,<BR>
Wondered, and showed his pleasure, at the say<BR>
In visage, gesture, and in joyful word.<BR>
He waited till Rogero sleeping lay;<BR>
Then softly sent his guard to take that lord;<BR>
And made the valiant Child, who had no dread<BR>
Of such a danger, prisoner in his bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
By his own shield accused, that witness true,<BR>
The Child is captive in Novogorood,<BR>
To Ungiardo, worst among the cruel, who<BR>
Marvellous mirth to have that prisoner shewed.<BR>
And what, since he was naked, could he do,<BR>
Bound, while his eyes were yet by slumber glued?<BR>
A courier, who the news should quickly bear,<BR>
Ungiardo bids to Constantine repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Constantine on that night with all his host,<BR>
Raising his camp, from Save&#8217;s green shore had gone:<BR>
With this in Beleticche he takes post,<BR>
Androphilus&#8217;, his sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s town,<BR>
Father of him, whose arms in their first joust<BR>
(As if of wax had been his habergeon)<BR>
Had pierced and carved the puissant cavalier,<BR>
Now by Ungiardo pent in dungeon drear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Here from attack the emperor makes assure<BR>
The city walls and gates on every side;<BR>
Lest, from the Bulgar squadrons ill secure,<BR>
Having so good a warrior for their guide,<BR>
His broken Grecians worse than fear endure;<BR>
Deeming the rest would by his hand have died.<BR>
Now he is taken, these breed no alarms;<BR>
Nor would he fear the banded world in arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
The emperor, swimming in a summer sea,<BR>
Knows not for very pleasure what to do:<BR>
&#8220;Truly the Bulgars may be said to be<BR>
Vanquished,&#8221; he cries, with bold and cheerful brow.<BR>
As he would feel assured of victory,<BR>
That had of either arm deprived his foe;<BR>
So the emperor was assured, and so rejoiced,<BR>
When good Rogero&#8217;s fate the warrior voiced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
No less occasion has the emperor&#8217;s son<BR>
For joying; for besides that he anew<BR>
Trusts to acquire Belgrade, and tower and town<BR>
Throughout the Bulgars&#8217; country to subdue,<BR>
He would by favours make the knight his own,<BR>
And hopes to rank him in his warlike crew:<BR>
Nor need he envy, guarded by his blade,<BR>
King Charles&#8217;, Orlando&#8217;s, or Rinaldo&#8217;s aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Theodora was by other thoughts possest,<BR>
Whose son was killed by young Rogero&#8217;s spear;<BR>
Which through his shoulders, entering at his breast,<BR>
Issued a palm&#8217;s breadth in the stripling&#8217;s rear;<BR>
Constantine&#8217;s sister she, by grief opprest,<BR>
Fell down before him; and with many a tear<BR>
That dropt into her bosom, while she sued,<BR>
His heart with pity softened and subdued.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I still before these feet will bow my knee,<BR>
Save on this felon, good my lord,&#8221; (she cried)<BR>
&#8220;Who killed my son, to venge me thou agree,<BR>
Now that we have him in our hold; beside<BR>
That he thy nephew was, thou seest how thee<BR>
He loved; thou seest what feats upon thy side<BR>
That warrior wrought; thou seest if thou wilt blot<BR>
Thine own good name, if thou avenge him not.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou seest how righteous Heaven by pity stirred<BR>
From the wide champaign, red with Grecian gore,<BR>
Bears that fell man; and like a reckless bird<BR>
Into the fowler&#8217;s net hath made him soar;<BR>
That for short season, for revenge deferred,<BR>
My son may mourn upon the Stygian shore.<BR>
Give me, my lord, I pray, this cruel foe,<BR>
That by his torment I may soothe my woe.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
So well she mourns; and in such moving wise<BR>
And efficacious doth she make lament;<BR>
(Nor from before the emperor will arise,<BR>
Though he three times and four the dame has hent,<BR>
And to uplift by word and action tries)<BR>
That he is forced her wishes to content;<BR>
And thus, according to her prayer, commands<BR>
The Child to be delivered to her hands;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
And, not therein his orders to delay,<BR>
They take the warrior of the unicorn<BR>
To cruel Theodora; but one day<BR>
Of respite has the knight: to have him torn<BR>
In quarters, yet alive; to rend and slay<BR>
Her prisoners publicly with shame and scorn,<BR>
Seems a poor pain; and he must undergo<BR>
Other unwonted and unmeasured woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
At the commandment of that woman dread,<BR>
Chains on his neck and hands and feet they don;<BR>
And put him in a dungeon-cell, where thread<BR>
Of light was never by Apollo thrown:<BR>
He has a scanty mess of mouldy bread;<BR>
And sometimes is he left two days with none;<BR>
And one that doth the place of jailer fill<BR>
Is prompter than herself to work him ill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Oh! if Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter brave and fair,<BR>
Of if Marphisa of exalted mind<BR>
Had heard Rogero&#8217;s sad estate declare,<BR>
And how he in this guise in prison pined,<BR>
To his rescue either would have made repair,<BR>
And would have flung the fear of death behind:<BR>
Nor had bold Bradamant, intent to aid,<BR>
Respect to Beatrice or Aymon paid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile King Charlemagne upon his side,<BR>
Heeding his promise made in solemn sort,<BR>
That none should have the damsel for his bride,<BR>
That of her prowess in the field fell short;<BR>
Not only had his sovereign pleasure cried<BR>
With sound of trumpet in his royal court,<BR>
But in each city subject to his crown.<BR>
Hence quickly through the world the bruit was blown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Such the condition which he bids proclaim:<BR>
He that would with Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter wed<BR>
Must with the sword contend against that dame<BR>
From the suns rise until he seeks his bed;<BR>
And if he for that time maintains the game,<BR>
And is not overcome, without more said,<BR>
The lady is adjudged to have lost the stake;<BR>
Nor him for husband can refuse to take.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
The choice of arms must be by her foregone,<BR>
No matter who may claim it in the course:<BR>
And by the damsel this may well be done,<BR>
Good at all arms alike, on foot or horse.<BR>
Aymon, who cannot strive against the crown,<BR>
&#8212;Cannot and will not&#8212;yields at length parforce.<BR>
He much the matter sifts, and in the end<BR>
Resolves to court with Bradamant to wend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Though for the daughter choler and disdain<BR>
The mother nursed, yet that she honour due<BR>
Might have, she garments, dyed in different grain,<BR>
Had wrought for her, of various form and hue.<BR>
Bradamant for the court of Charlemagne<BR>
Departs, and finding not her love, to her view<BR>
His noble court appears like that no more,<BR>
Which had appeared to her so fair before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
As he that hath beheld a garden, bright<BR>
With flowers and leaves in April or in May,<BR>
And next beholds it, when the sun his light<BR>
Hath sloped toward the north, and shortened day,<BR>
Finds it a desert horrid to the sight;<BR>
So, now that her Rogero is away,<BR>
To Bradamant, who thither made resort,<BR>
No longer what it was appeared that court.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
What is become of him she doth not dare<BR>
Demand, lest more suspicion thence be bred;<BR>
But listens still, and searches here and there;<BR>
That this by some, unquestioned, may be said;<BR>
Knows he is gone, but has no notion where<BR>
The warrior, when he went, his steps had sped;<BR>
Because, departing thence, he spake no word<BR>
Save to the squire who journeyed with his lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Oh! how she sighs! how fears the gentle maid,<BR>
Hearing Rogero, as it were, was flown!<BR>
Oh! how above all other terrors, weighed<BR>
The fear, that to forget her he was gone!<BR>
That, seeing Aymon still his wish gainsayed,<BR>
And that to wed the damsel hope was none,<BR>
He fled, perchance, so hoping to be loosed<BR>
From toils wherein he by her love was noosed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
And that with further end the youthful lord<BR>
Her from his heart more speedily to chase,<BR>
Will rove from realm to realm, till one afford<BR>
Some dame, that may his former love efface;<BR>
Even, as the proverb says, that in a board<BR>
One nail drives out another from its place.<BR>
A second thought succeeds, and paints the youth<BR>
Arraigned of fickleness, as full of truth;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
And her reproves for having lent an ear<BR>
To a suspicion so unjust and blind;<BR>
And so, this thought absolves the cavalier;<BR>
And that accuses; and both audience find;<BR>
And now this way, now that, she seemed to veer;<BR>
Nor this, nor that&#8212;irresolute of mind&#8212;<BR>
Preferred: yet still to what gave most delight<BR>
Most promptly leaned, and loathed its opposite;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
And thinking, ever and anon, anew<BR>
On that so oft repeated by the knight,<BR>
As for grave sin, remorse and sorrow grew<BR>
That she had nursed suspicion and affright;<BR>
And she, as her Rogero were in view,<BR>
Would blame herself, and would her bosom smite;<BR>
And say: &#8220;I see &#8217;twas ill such thoughts to nurse,<BR>
But he, the cause, is even cause of worse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Love is the cause; that in my heart inlaid<BR>
Thy form, so graceful and so fair to see;<BR>
And so thy darling and thy wit pourtrayed,<BR>
And worth, of all so bruited, that to me<BR>
It seems impossible that wife or maid,<BR>
Blest with thy sight, should not be fired by thee;<BR>
And that she should not all her art apply<BR>
To unbind, and fasten thee with other tie.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! wellaway! if in my thought Love so<BR>
Thy thought, as thy fair visage, had designed,<BR>
This&#8212;am I well assured&#8212;in open show,<BR>
As I unseen believe it, should I find;<BR>
And be so quit of Jealousy, that foe<BR>
Would not still harass my suspicious mind;<BR>
And, where she is by me repulsed with pain,<BR>
Not quelled and routed would she be, but slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I am like miser, so intent on gear,<BR>
And who hath this so buried in his heart,<BR>
That he, for hoarded treasure still in fear,<BR>
Cannot live gladly from his wealth apart.<BR>
Since I Rogero neither see nor hear,<BR>
More puissant far than Hope, O Fear! thou art;<BR>
To thee, though false and idle I give way;<BR>
And cannot choose but yield myself thy prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But I, Rogero, shall no sooner spy<BR>
The light of thy glad countenance appear,<BR>
Against mine every credence, from mine eye<BR>
Concealed (and woe is me), I know not where,&#8212;<BR>
Oh! how true Hope false Fear shall from on high<BR>
Depose withal, and to the bottom bear!<BR>
Ah! turn to me, Rogero! turn again,<BR>
And comfort Hope, whom Fear hath almost slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As when the sun withdraws his glittering head,<BR>
The shadows lengthen, causing vain affright;<BR>
And as the shadows, when he leaves his bed,<BR>
Vanish, and reassure the timid wight:<BR>
Without Rogero so I suffer dread;<BR>
Dread lasts not, if Rogero is in sight.<BR>
Return to me, return, Rogero, lest<BR>
My hope by fear should wholly be opprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As every spark is in the night alive,<BR>
And suddenly extinguished when &#8217;tis morn;<BR>
When me my sun doth of his rays deprive,<BR>
Against me felon Fear uplifts his horn:<BR>
But they the shades of night no sooner drive,<BR>
Than Fears are past and gone, and Hopes return.<BR>
Return, alas! return, O radiance dear!<BR>
And drive from me that foul, consuming Fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If the sun turn from us and shorten day,<BR>
Earth all its beauties from the sight doth hide;<BR>
The wild winds howl, and snows and ice convey;<BR>
Bird sings not; nor is leaf or flower espied.<BR>
So, whensoever thou thy gladsome ray,<BR>
O my fair sun, from me dost turn aside,<BR>
A thousand, and all evil, dreads, make drear<BR>
Winter within me many times a year.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Return, my sun, return! and springtide sweet,<BR>
Which evermore I long to see, bring back;<BR>
Dislodge the snows and ice with genial hear;<BR>
And clear my mind, so clouded o&#8217;er and black.&#8221;<BR>
As Philomel, or Progne, with the meat<BR>
Returning, which her famished younglings lack,<BR>
Mourns o&#8217;er an empty nest, or as the dove<BR>
Laments himself at having lost is love;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
The unhappy Bradamant laments her so,<BR>
Fearing the Child is reft from her and gone;<BR>
While often tears her visage overflow:<BR>
But she, as best she can, conceals her moan.<BR>
Oh! how&#8212;oh! how much worse would be her woe,<BR>
If what she knew not to the maid were known!<BR>
That, prisoned and with pain and pine consumed,<BR>
Her consort to a cruel death was doomed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
The cruelty which by that beldam ill<BR>
Was practised on the prisoned cavalier,<BR>
And who prepared the wretched Child to kill,<BR>
By torture new and pains unused whilere,<BR>
While so Rogero pined, the gracious will<BR>
Of Heaven conveyed to gentle Leo&#8217;s ear;<BR>
And put into his heart the means to aid,<BR>
And not to let such worth be overlaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
The courteous Leo that Rogero loved,<BR>
Not that the Grecian knew howe&#8217;er that he<BR>
Rogero was, but by that valour moved<BR>
Which sole and superhuman seemed to be,<BR>
Thought much, and mused, and planned, how it behoved<BR>
&#8212;And found at last a way&#8212;to set him free;<BR>
So that his cruel aunt should have no right<BR>
To grieve or say he did her a despite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
In secret, Leo with the man that bore<BR>
The prison-keys a parley had, and said,<BR>
He wished to see that cavalier, before<BR>
Upon the wretch was done a doom so dread.<BR>
When it was night, one, faithful found of yore,<BR>
Bold, strong, and good in brawl, he thither led;<BR>
And&#8212;by the silent warder taught that none<BR>
Must know &#8217;twas Leo&#8212;was the door undone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Leo, escorted by none else beside,<BR>
Was led by the compliant castellain,<BR>
With his companion, to the tower, where stied<BR>
Was he, reserved for nature&#8217;s latest pain.<BR>
There round the neck of their unwary guide,<BR>
Who turns his back the wicket to unchain,<BR>
A slip-knot Leo and his follower cast;<BR>
And, throttled by the noose, he breathes his last.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8212;The trap upraised, by rope from thence suspended<BR>
For such a need&#8212;the Grecian cavalier,<BR>
With lighted flambeau in his hand, descended,<BR>
Where, straitly bound, and without sun to cheer,<BR>
Rogero lay, upon a grate extended,<BR>
Less than a palm&#8217;s breadth of the water clear:<BR>
To kill him in a month, or briefer space,<BR>
Nothing was needed but that deadly place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Lovingly Leo clipt the Child, and, &#8220;Me,<BR>
O cavalier! thy matchless valour,&#8221; cried,<BR>
&#8220;Hath in indissoluble bands to thee,<BR>
In willing and eternal service, tried;<BR>
And wills thy good to mine preferred should be,<BR>
And I for thine my safety set aside,<BR>
And weigh thy friendship more than sire, and all<BR>
Whom I throughout the world my kindred call.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I Leo am, that thou what fits mayst know,<BR>
Come to thy succour, the Greek emperor&#8217;s son:<BR>
If ever Constantine, my father, trow<BR>
That I have aided thee, I danger run<BR>
To be exiled, or aye with troubled brow<BR>
Regarded for the deed that I have done;<BR>
For thee he hates because of those thy blade<BR>
Put to the rout and slaughtered near Belgrade.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
He his discourse with more beside pursues,<BR>
That might from death to life the Child recall;<BR>
And all this while Rogero&#8217;s hands doth loose.<BR>
&#8220;Infinite thanks I owe you,&#8221; cries the thrall,<BR>
&#8220;And I the life you gave me, for your use<BR>
Will ever render back, upon your call;<BR>
And still, at all your need, I for your sake,<BR>
And at all times, that life will promptly stake.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Rogero is rescued; and the gaoler slain<BR>
Is left in that dark dungeon in his place;<BR>
Nor is Rogero known, nor are the twain:<BR>
Leo the warrior, free from bondage base,<BR>
Brings home, and there in safety to remain<BR>
Persuades, in secret, four or six days&#8217; space:<BR>
Meanwhile for him will he retrieve the gear<BR>
And courser, by Ungiardo reft whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Open the gaol is found at dawn of light,<BR>
The gaoler strangled, and Rogero gone.<BR>
Some think that these or those had helped his flight:<BR>
All talk; and yet the truth is guessed by none.<BR>
Well may they think by any other wight<BR>
Rather than Leo had the deed been done;<BR>
For many deemed he had cause to have repaid<BR>
The Child with scathe, and none to give him aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
So wildered by such kindness, so immersed<BR>
In wonder, is the rescued cavalier,<BR>
So from those thoughts is he estranged, that erst<BR>
So many weary miles had made him steer,<BR>
His second thoughts confronting with his first,<BR>
Nor these like those, nor those like these appear.<BR>
He first with hatred, rage, and venom burned;<BR>
With pity and with love then wholly yearned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Much muses he by night and much by day;<BR>
&#8212;Nor cares for ought, nor ought desires beside&#8212;<BR>
By equal or more courtesy to pay<BR>
The mighty debt that him to Leo tied.<BR>
Be his life long or short, or what it may,<BR>
Albeit to Leo&#8217;s service all applied,<BR>
Dies he a thousand deaths, he can do nought,<BR>
But more will be deserved, Rogero thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Thither meanwhile had tidings been conveyed<BR>
Of Charles&#8217; decree: that who in nuptial tye<BR>
Would yoke with Bradamant, with trenchant blade<BR>
Or lance must with the maid his prowess try.<BR>
These news the Grecian prince so ill appaid,<BR>
His cheek was seen to blanch with sickly dye;<BR>
Because, as one that measured well his might,<BR>
He knew he was no match for her in fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Communing with himself, he can supply<BR>
(He sees) the valour wanting with his wit;<BR>
And the strange knight with his own ensignry,<BR>
Whose name is yet unknown to him, will fit:<BR>
Him he against Frank champion, far and nigh,<BR>
Believes he may for force and daring pit;<BR>
And if the knight to that emprize agree,<BR>
Vanquished and taken Bradamant will be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
But two things must he do; must, first, dispose<BR>
That cavalier to undertake the emprize;<BR>
Then send afield the champion, whom he chose,<BR>
In mode, that none suspect the youth&#8217;s disguise:<BR>
To him the matter Leo doth disclose;<BR>
And after prays in efficacious wise,<BR>
That he the combat with the maid will claim,<BR>
Under false colours and in other&#8217;s name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Much weighs the Grecian&#8217;s eloquence; but more<BR>
Than eloquence with good Rogero weighed<BR>
The mighty obligation which he bore;<BR>
That debt which cannot ever be repaid.<BR>
So, albeit it appeared a hardship sore<BR>
And thing well-nigh impossible, he said,<BR>
With blither face than heart, that Leo&#8217;s will<BR>
In all that he commands he would fulfil.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Albeit no sooner he the intent exprest,<BR>
Than with sore grief Rogero&#8217;s heart was shent;<BR>
Which, night and day, and ever, doth molest,<BR>
Ever afflict him, evermore torment:<BR>
And though he sees his death is manifest,<BR>
Never will he confess he doth repent:<BR>
Rather than not with Leo&#8217;s prayer comply,<BR>
A thousand deaths, not one, the Child will die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Right sure he is to die; if he forego<BR>
The lady, he foregoes his life no less.<BR>
His heart will break through his distress and woe,<BR>
Or, breaking not with woe and with distress,<BR>
He will, himself, the bands of life undo,<BR>
And of its clay the spirit dispossess.<BR>
For all things can he better bear than one;<BR>
Than see that gentle damsel not his own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
To die is he disposed; but how to die<BR>
Cannot as yet the sorrowing lord decide:<BR>
Sometimes he thinks his prowess to belie,<BR>
And offer to her sword his naked side:<BR>
For never death can come more happily<BR>
Than if her hand the fatal faulchion guide:<BR>
Then sees, except he wins the martial maid<BR>
For that Greek prince, the debt remains unpaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
For he with Bradamant, as with a foe,<BR>
Promised to do, not feign, a fight in mail,<BR>
And not to make of arms a seeming show;<BR>
So that his sword should Leo ill avail.<BR>
Then by his word will he abide; and though<BR>
His breast now these now other thoughts assail,<BR>
All from his bosom chased the generous youth,<BR>
Save that which moved him to maintain his truth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
With the emperor&#8217;s licence, armour to prepare,<BR>
And steeds meanwhile had wrought his youthful son;<BR>
Who with such goodly following as might square<BR>
With his degree, upon his way was gone:<BR>
With him Rogero rides, through Leo&#8217;s care,<BR>
Equipt with horse and arms, that were his own.<BR>
Day after day the squadron pricks; nor tarries<BR>
Until arrived in France; arrived at Paris.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Leo will enter not the town; but nigh<BR>
Pitches his broad pavilions on the plain;<BR>
And his arrival by an embassy<BR>
Makes known that day to royal Charlemagne.<BR>
Well pleased is he; and visits testify<BR>
And many gifts the monarch&#8217;s courteous vein.<BR>
His journey&#8217;s cause the Grecian prince displayed,<BR>
And to dispatch his suit the sovereign prayed:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
To send afield the damsel, who denied<BR>
Ever to take in wedlock any lord<BR>
Weaker than her: for she should be his bride,<BR>
Or he would perish by the lady&#8217;s sword.<BR>
Charles undertook for this; and, on her side,<BR>
The following day upon the listed sward<BR>
Before the walls, in haste, enclosed that night,<BR>
Appeared the martial maid, equipt for fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Rogero past the night before the day<BR>
Wherein by him the battle should be done,<BR>
Like that which felon spends, condemning to pay<BR>
Life&#8217;s forfeit with the next succeeding sun:<BR>
He made his choice to combat in the fray<BR>
All armed; because he would discovery shun:<BR>
Nor barded steed he backed, nor lance he shook;<BR>
Nor other weapon than his faulchion took.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
No lance he took: yet was it not through fear<BR>
Of that which Argal&igrave;a whilom swayed;<BR>
Astolpho&#8217;s next; then hers, that in career<BR>
Her foemen ever upon earth had laid:<BR>
Because none weened such force was in the spear,<BR>
Nor that it was by necromancy made;<BR>
Excepting royal Galaphron alone;<BR>
Who had it forged, and gave it to his son.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Nay, bold Astolpho, and the lady who<BR>
Afterwards bore it, deemed that not to spell,<BR>
But simply to their proper force, was due<BR>
The praise that they in knightly joust excel;<BR>
And with whatever spear they fought, those two<BR>
Believed that they should have performed as well.<BR>
What only makes that knight the joust forego<BR>
Is that he would not his Frontino show.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
For easily that steed of generous kind<BR>
She might have known, if him she had espied;<BR>
Whom in Montalban, long to her consigned,<BR>
The gentle damsel had been wont to ride.<BR>
Rogero, that but schemes, but hath in mind<BR>
How he from Brandamant himself shall hide,<BR>
Neither Frontino nor yet other thing.<BR>
Whereby he may be known, afield will bring.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
With a new sword will he the maid await;<BR>
For well he knew against the enchanted blade<BR>
As soft as paste would prove all mail and plate;<BR>
For never any steel its fury stayed;<BR>
And heavily with hammer, to rebate<BR>
Its edge, as well he on this faulchion layed.<BR>
So armed, Rogero in the lists appeared,<BR>
When the first dawn of day the horizon cheered.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
To look like Leo, o&#8217;er his breast is spread<BR>
The surcoat that the prince is wont to wear;<BR>
And the gold eagle with its double head<BR>
He blazoned on the crimson shield doth bear;<BR>
And (what the Child&#8217;s disguisement well may stead)<BR>
Of equal size and stature are the pair.<BR>
In the other&#8217;s form presents himself the one;<BR>
That other lets himself be seen of none.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Dordona&#8217;s martial maid is of a vein<BR>
Right different from the gentle youth&#8217;s, who sore<BR>
Hammers and blunts the faulchion&#8217;s tempered grain,<BR>
Lest it his opposite should cleave or bore.<BR>
She whets her steel, and into it would fain<BR>
Enter, that stripling to the quick to gore:<BR>
Yea, would such fury to her strokes impart,<BR>
That each should go directly to his heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
As on the start the generous barb in spied,<BR>
When he the signal full of fire attends;<BR>
And paws now here now there; and opens wide<BR>
His nostrils, and his pointed ears extends;<BR>
So the bold damsel, to the lists defied,<BR>
Who knows not with Rogero she contends,<BR>
Seemed to have fire within her veins, nor found<BR>
Resting-place, waiting for the trumpet&#8217;s sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
As sometimes after thunder sudden wind<BR>
Turns the sea upside down; and far and nigh<BR>
Dim clouds of dust the cheerful daylight blind,<BR>
Raised in a thought from earth, and whirled heaven-high;<BR>
Scud beasts and herd together with the hind;<BR>
And into hail and rain dissolves the sky;<BR>
So she upon the signal bared her brand,<BR>
And fell on her Rogero, sword in hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
But well-built wall, strong tower, or aged oak,<BR>
No more are moved by blasts that round them rave,<BR>
No more by furious sea is moved the rock,<BR>
Smote day and night by the tempestuous wave,<BR>
Than in those arms, secure from hostile stroke,<BR>
Which erst to Trojan Hector Vulcan gave,<BR>
Moved was he by that ire and hatred rank<BR>
Which stormed about his head, and breast, and flank.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Now aims that martial maid a trenchant blow,<BR>
And now gives point; and wholly is intent<BR>
&#8217;Twixt plate and plate to reach her hated foe;<BR>
So that her stifled fury she may vent:<BR>
Now on this side, now that, now high, now low<BR>
She strikes, and circles him, on mischief bent;<BR>
And evermore she rages and repines;<BR>
As balked of every purpose she designs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
As he that layeth siege to well-walled town,<BR>
And flanked about with solid bulwarks, still<BR>
Renews the assault; now fain would batter down<BR>
Gateway or tower; now gaping fosse would fill;<BR>
Yet vainly toils (for entrance is there none)<BR>
And wastes his host, aye frustrate of his will;<BR>
So sorely toils and strives without avail<BR>
The damsel, nor can open plate or mail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Sparks now his shield, now helm, now cuirass scatter,<BR>
While straight and back strokes, aimed now low, now high,<BR>
Which good Rogero&#8217;s head and bosom batter,<BR>
And arms, by thousands and by thousands fly<BR>
Faster than on the sounding farm-roof patter<BR>
Hailstones descending from a troubled sky.<BR>
Rogero, at his ward, with dexterous care,<BR>
Defends himself, and ne&#8217;er offends the fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Now stopt, now circled, now retired the knight,<BR>
And oft his hand his foot accompanied;<BR>
And lifted shield, and shifted sword in fight,<BR>
Where shifting he the hostile hand espied.<BR>
Either he smote her not, or&#8212;die he smite&#8212;<BR>
Smote, where he deemed least evil would betide.<BR>
The lady, ere the westering sun descend,<BR>
Desires to bring that duel to an end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Of the edict she remembered her, and knew<BR>
Her peril, save the foe was quickly sped:<BR>
For if she took not in one day nor slew<BR>
Her claimant, she was taken; and his head<BR>
Ph&#339;bus was now about to hide from view,<BR>
Nigh Hercules&#8217; pillars, in his watery bed,<BR>
When first she &#8217;gan misdoubt her power to cope<BR>
With the strong foe, and to abandon hope.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
By how much more hope fails the damsel, so<BR>
Much more her anger waxes; she her blows<BR>
Redoubling, yet the harness of her foe<BR>
Will break, which through that day unbroken shows;<BR>
As he, that at his daily drudgery slow,<BR>
Sees night on his unfinished labour close,<BR>
Hurries and toils and moils without avail,<BR>
Till wearied strength and light together fail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Didst thou, O miserable damsel, trow<BR>
Whom thou wouldst kill, if in that cavalier<BR>
Matched against thee thou didst Rogero know,<BR>
On whom depend thy very life-threads, ere<BR>
Thou killed him thou wouldst kill thyself; for thou,<BR>
I know, dost hold him than thyself more dear;<BR>
And when he for Rogero shall be known,<BR>
I know these very strokes thou wilt bemoan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
King Charles and peers him sheathed in plate and shell<BR>
Deem not Rogero, but the emperor&#8217;s son;<BR>
And viewing in that combat fierce and fell<BR>
Such force and quickness by the stripling shown;<BR>
And, without e&#8217;er offending her, how well<BR>
That knight defends himself, now change their tone;<BR>
Esteem both well assorted; and declare<BR>
The champions worthy of each other are.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
When Ph&#339;bus wholly under water goes,<BR>
Charlemagne bids the warring pair divide;<BR>
And Bradamant (nor boots it to oppose)<BR>
Allots to youthful Leo as a bride.<BR>
Not there Rogero tarried to repose;<BR>
Nor loosed his armour, nor his helm untied:<BR>
On a small hackney, hurrying sore, he went<BR>
Where Leo him awaited in his tent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Twice in fraternal guise and oftener threw<BR>
Leo his arms about the cavalier;<BR>
And next his helmet from his head withdrew,<BR>
And kiss&#8217;d him on both cheeks with loving cheer.<BR>
&#8220;I would,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;that thou wouldst ever do<BR>
By me what pleaseth thee; for thou wilt ne&#8217;er<BR>
Weary my love: at any call I lend<BR>
To thee myself and state; these friendly spend;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor see I recompense, which can repay<BR>
The mighty obligation that I owe;<BR>
Though of the garland I should disarray<BR>
My brows, and upon thee that gift bestow.&#8221;<BR>
Rogero, on whom his sorrows press and prey,<BR>
Who loathes his life, immersed in that deep woe,<BR>
Little replies; the ensigns he had worn<BR>
Returns, and takes again his unicorn;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
And showing himself spiritless and spent,<BR>
From thence as quickly as he could withdrew,<BR>
And from young Leo&#8217;s to his lodgings went;<BR>
When it was midnight, armed himself anew,<BR>
Saddled his horse, and sallied from his tent;<BR>
(He takes no leave, and none his going view;)<BR>
And his Frontino to that road addrest,<BR>
Which seemed to please the goodly courser best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Now by straight way and now by crooked wound<BR>
Frontino, now by wood and wide champaign;<BR>
And all night with his rider paced that round,<BR>
Who never ceased a moment to complain:<BR>
He called on Death, and therein comfort found;<BR>
Since broke by him alone is stubborn pain;<BR>
Nor saw, save Death, what other power could close<BR>
The account of his insufferable woes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whereof should I complain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;wo is me!<BR>
So of my every good at once forlorn?<BR>
Ah! if I will not bear this injury<BR>
Without revenge, against whom shall I turn?<BR>
For I, besides myself, none other see<BR>
That hath inflicted on me scathe and scorn.<BR>
Then I to take revenge for all the harm<BR>
Done to myself, against myself must arm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet was but to myself this injury done,<BR>
Myself to spare (because this touched but me)<BR>
I haply could, yet hardly could, be won;<BR>
Nay, I will say outright, I could not be.<BR>
Less can I be, since not to me alone,<BR>
But Bradamant, is done this injury;<BR>
Even if I could consent myself to spare,<BR>
It fits me not unvenged to leave that fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then I the damsel will avenge, and die,<BR>
(Nor this disturbs me) whatsoe&#8217;er betide;<BR>
For, bating death, I know not aught, whereby<BR>
Defence against my grief can be supplied.<BR>
But I lament myself alone, that I<BR>
Before offending her, should not have died.<BR>
O happier Fortune! had I breathed my last<BR>
In Theodora&#8217;s dungeon prisoned fast!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Though she had slain, had tortured me before<BR>
She slew, as prompted by her cruelty,<BR>
At least the hope would have remained in store<BR>
That I by Bradamant should pitied be:<BR>
But when she knows that I loved Leo more<BR>
Than her, that, of my own accord and free,<BR>
Myself of her, I for his good, deprive,<BR>
Dead will she rightly hate me or alive.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
These words he said and many more, with sigh<BR>
And heavy sob withal accompanied,<BR>
And, when another sun illumed the sky,<BR>
Mid strange and gloomy woods himself espied;<BR>
And, for he desperate was and bent to die,<BR>
And he, as best he could, his death would hide;<BR>
This place to him seemed far removed from view,<BR>
And fitted for the deed that he would do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
He entered into that dark woodland, where<BR>
He thickest trees and most entangled spied:<BR>
But first Frontino was the warrior&#8217;s care,<BR>
Whom he unharnessed wholly, and untied.<BR>
&#8220;O my Frontino, if thy merits rare<BR>
I could reward, thou little cause&#8221; (he cried)<BR>
&#8220;Shouldst have to envy him, so highly graced,<BR>
Who soared to heaven, and mid the stars was placed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor Cillarus, nor Arion, was whilere<BR>
Worthier than thee, nor merited more praise;<BR>
Nor any other steed, whose name we hear<BR>
Sounded in Grecian or in Latin lays.<BR>
Was any such in other points thy peer,<BR>
None of them, well I know, the vaunt can raise;<BR>
That such high honour and such courtesy<BR>
Were upon him bestowed, as were on thee.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Since to the gentlest maid, of fairest dye,<BR>
And boldest that hath been, or evermore<BR>
Will be, thou wast so dear, she used to tie<BR>
Thy trappings, and to thee thy forage bore:<BR>
Dear wast thou to my lady-love: Ah! why<BR>
Call I her mine, since she is mine no more?<BR>
If I have given her to another lord,<BR>
Why turn I not upon myself this sword?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
If him these thoughts so harass and torment,<BR>
That bird and beast are softened by his cries;<BR>
(For, saving these, none hears the sad lament,<BR>
Nor sees the flood that trickles form his eyes)<BR>
You are not to believe that more content<BR>
The Lady Bradamant in Paris lies;<BR>
Who can no longer her delay excuse,<BR>
Nor Leo for her wedded lord refuse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Ere she herself to any consort tie,<BR>
Beside her own Rogero, she will fain<BR>
Do what so can be done; her word belie;<BR>
Anger friends, kindred, court, and Charlemagne;<BR>
And if she nothing else can do, will die,<BR>
By poison or her own good faulchion slain:<BR>
For not to live appears far lesser woe,<BR>
Than, living, her Rogero to forego.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Rogero mine, ah! wonder gone&#8221; (she cried)<BR>
&#8220;Art thou; and canst thou so far distant be,<BR>
Thou heardest not this royal edict cried,<BR>
A thing concealed from none, expecting thee?<BR>
Faster than thee would none have hither hied,<BR>
I wot, hadst thou known this; ah! wretched me!<BR>
How can I e&#8217;er in future think of aught,<BR>
Saving the worst that can by me be thought?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;How can it be, Rogero, thou alone<BR>
Hast read not what by all the world is read?<BR>
If thou hast read it not, nor hither flown,<BR>
How canst thou but a prisoner be, or dead?<BR>
But well I wot, that if the truth were known,<BR>
This Leo will for thee some snare have spread:<BR>
The traitor will have barred thy way, intent<BR>
Thou shouldst not him by better speed prevent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;From Charles I gained the promise, that to none<BR>
Less puissant than myself should I be given;<BR>
In the reliance thou wouldst be that one,<BR>
With whom I should in arms have vainly striven.<BR>
None I esteemed, excepting thee alone:<BR>
But well my rashness is rebuked by Heaven:<BR>
Since I by one am taken in this wise<BR>
Unfamed through life for any fair emprize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If I am held as taken, since the knight<BR>
I had not force to take nor yet to slay;<BR>
A thing that is not, in my judgment, right;<BR>
Nor I to Charles&#8217;s sentence will give way,<BR>
I know that I shall be esteemed as light,<BR>
If what I lately said, I now unsay;<BR>
But of those many ladies that have past<BR>
For light, I am not, I, the first or last.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Enough I to my lover faith maintain,<BR>
And, firmer than a rock, am still found true!<BR>
And far herein surpass the female train,<BR>
That were in olden days, or are in new!<BR>
Nor, if they me as fickle shall arraign,<BR>
Care I, so good from fickleness ensue;<BR>
Though I am lighter than a leaf be said,<BR>
So I be forced not with that Greek no wed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
These things and more beside the damsel bright<BR>
(&#8217;Twixt which oft sobs and tears were interposed),<BR>
Ceased not to utter through the livelong night<BR>
Which upon that unhappy day had closed.<BR>
But, when within Cimmeria&#8217;s caverned height<BR>
Nocturnus with his troops of shades reposed,<BR>
Heaven, which eternally had willed the maid<BR>
Should be Rogero&#8217;s consort, brought him aid:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
This moves the haught Marphisa, when &#8217;tis morn,<BR>
To appear before the king; to whom that maid<BR>
Saith, to the Child, her brother, mighty scorn<BR>
Was done; nor should he be so ill appaid,<BR>
That from him should his plighted wife be torn;<BR>
And nought thereof unto the warrior said;<BR>
And on whoever lists she will in strife<BR>
Prove Bradamant to be Rogero&#8217;s wife;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
And this, before all others, will prove true<BR>
On her, if to deny it she will dare;<BR>
For she had to Rogero, in her view,<BR>
Spoken those words, which they that marry swear;<BR>
And with all ceremony wont and due<BR>
So was the contract sealed between the pair,<BR>
They were no longer free; nor could forsake<BR>
The one the other, other spouse to take.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
Whether Marphisa true or falsely spake,<BR>
I well believe that, rather with intent<BR>
Young Leo&#8217;s purpose, right or wrong, to break,<BR>
Than tell the truth, she speaks; and with consent<BR>
Of Bradamant doth that avowal make:<BR>
For to exclude the hated Leo bent,<BR>
And of Rogero to be repossest,<BR>
This she believes her shortest way and best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
Sorely by this disturbed, King Charlemagne<BR>
Bade Bradamant be called, and to her told<BR>
That which the proud Marphisa would maintain;<BR>
And Aymon present in the press behold!<BR>
&#8212;Bradamant drops her head, nor treats as vain,<BR>
Nor vouches what avows that virgin bold,<BR>
In such confusion, they may well believe<BR>
That fierce Marphisa speaks not to deceive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
Joy good Orlando and joy Rinaldo show,<BR>
Who view in valorous Marphisa&#8217;s plea<BR>
A cause the alliance shall no further go,<BR>
Which sealed already Leo deemed to be;<BR>
And yet, in spite of stubborn Aymon&#8217;s no,<BR>
Bradamant shall Rogero&#8217;s consort be;<BR>
And they may, without strife, without despite<BR>
Done to Duke Aymon&#8217;s, give her to the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
For if such words have pass&#8217;d between the twain,<BR>
Fast is the knot and cannot be untied;<BR>
They what they vowed more fairly will obtain,<BR>
And without further strife are these affied.<BR>
&#8220;This is a plot, a plot devised in vain;<BR>
And ye deceive yourselves (Duke Aymon cried)<BR>
For, were the story true which ye have feigned,<BR>
Believe not therefore that your cause is gained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For granting what I will not yet allow,<BR>
And what I to believe as yet demur;<BR>
That weakly to Rogero so her vow<BR>
Was plighted, as Rogero&#8217;s was to her;<BR>
Where was the contract made, and when and how?<BR>
More clearly this to me must ye aver.<BR>
Either it was not so, I am advised;<BR>
Or was before Rogero was baptized.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if it were before the youthful knight<BR>
A Christian was, I will not heed it, I;<BR>
For &#8217;twixt a faithful and a paynim wight,<BR>
I deem that nought avails the marriage-tie.<BR>
For this not vainly in the doubtful fight<BR>
Should Constantine&#8217;s fair son have risked to die;<BR>
Nor Charlemagne for this, our sovereign lord<BR>
Will forfeit, I believe, his plighted word.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What now you say you should before have said,<BR>
While yet the matter was unbroke, and ere<BR>
Charles at my daughter&#8217;s prayer that edict made<BR>
Which has drawn Leo to the combat here.&#8221;<BR>
Orlando and Rinaldo were gainsayed<BR>
So before royal Charles by Clermont&#8217;s peer;<BR>
And equal Charlemagne heard either side,<BR>
But neither would for this nor that decide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
As in the southern or the northern breeze<BR>
The greenwood murmurs; and as on the shore,<BR>
When Aeolus with the god that rules the seas<BR>
Is wroth, the hoarse and hollow breakers roar,<BR>
So a loud rumour of this strife, that flees<BR>
Through France, and spreads and circles evermore,<BR>
Affords such matter to rehearse and hear,<BR>
That nought beside is bruised far or near.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
These with Rogero, those with Leo side;<BR>
But the most numerous are Rogero&#8217;s friends,<BR>
Who against Aymon, ten to one, divide.<BR>
Good Charlemagne to neither party bends;<BR>
But wills that cause shall be by justice tried,<BR>
And to his parliament the matter sends.<BR>
Marphisa, now the bridal was deferred,<BR>
Appeared anew, and other question stirred;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
And said, &#8220;In that anther cannot have<BR>
Bradamant, while my brother is alive,<BR>
Let Leo, if the gentle maid he crave,<BR>
His foe in listed fight of life deprive;<BR>
And he, that sends the other to his grave,<BR>
Freed from his rival, with the lady wive.&#8221;<BR>
Forthwith this challenge, as erewhile the rest,<BR>
To Leo was declared at Charles&#8217; behest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
Leo who if he had the cavalier<BR>
Of the unicorn, believed he from his foe<BR>
Was safe; and thought no peril would appear<BR>
Too hard a feat for him; and knew not how<BR>
Thence into solitary woods and drear<BR>
That warrior had been hurried by his woe;<BR>
Him gone for little time and for disport<BR>
Believed, and took his line in evil sort.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
This shortly Leo was condemned to rue:<BR>
For he, on whom too fondly he relied,<BR>
Nor on that day nor on the following two<BR>
Appeared, nor news of him were signified;<BR>
And combat with Rogero was, he knew,<BR>
Unsafe, unless that knight was on his side:<BR>
So sent, to eschew the threatened scathe and scorn,<BR>
To seek the warrior of the unicorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
Through city, and through hamlet, and through town,<BR>
He sends to seek Rogero, far and near:<BR>
And not content with this, himself is gone<BR>
In person, on his steed, to find the peer.<BR>
But of the missing warrior tidings none<BR>
Nor he nor any of the Court would hear<BR>
But for Melissa: I for other verse<BR>
Reserve myself, her doings to rehearse.</TD></TR>
