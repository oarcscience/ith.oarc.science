<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
The Count Orlando of the damsel bland<BR>
Who loves Zerbino, hears the piteous woes.<BR>
Next puts to death the felons with his hand<BR>
Who pent her there. Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter goes,<BR>
Seeking Rogero, where so large a band<BR>
The old Atlantes&#8217; magic walls enclose.<BR>
Her he impounds, deceived by fictions new.<BR>
Agramant ranks his army for review.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Those ancient cavaliers right happy were,<BR>
Born in an age, when, in the gloomy wood,<BR>
In valley, and in cave, wherein the bear,<BR>
Serpent, or lion, hid their savage brood,<BR>
They could find that, which now in palace rare<BR>
Is hardly found by judges proved and good;<BR>
Women, to wit, who in their freshest days<BR>
Of beauty worthily deserve the praise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Above I told you how a gentle maid<BR>
Orlando had discovered under ground,<BR>
And asked, by whom she thither was conveyed?<BR>
Pursuing now my tale, I tell, how drowned<BR>
In grief (her speech by many a sob delayed),<BR>
The damsel fair, in sweet and softest sound,<BR>
Summing them with what brevity she might,<BR>
Her ills recounted to Anglantes&#8217; knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Though I am sure,&#8221; she said, &#8220;O cavalier,<BR>
To suffer punishment for what I say;<BR>
Because I know, to him who pens me here,<BR>
This woman quickly will the fact display;<BR>
I would not but thou shouldst the story hear.<BR>
&#8212;And let my wretched life the forfeit pay!<BR>
For what can wait me better than that he,<BR>
My gaoler, should one day my death decree?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! I am Isabel, who once was styled<BR>
The daughter of Gallicia&#8217;s hapless king:<BR>
I said aright who was; but now the child<BR>
(No longer his) of care and suffering:<BR>
The fault of Love, by whom I was beguiled;<BR>
For against him alone this charge I bring.<BR>
Who sweetly, at the first, our wish applauds,<BR>
And weaves in secret but deceit and frauds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whilom I lived, content in Fortune&#8217;s smile,<BR>
Rich, blameless, fair, and young; to sad reverse<BR>
Condemned, I now am wretched, poor, and vile,<BR>
And in worse case, if any yet be worse.<BR>
But it is fitting, I to thee this while<BR>
From their first root my troubles should rehearse.<BR>
And it will soothe me, though of thee I borrow<BR>
No help, that thou compassionate my sorrow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My father in his city of Bayonne,<BR>
(To-day will be twelve months) a tourney dight;<BR>
Hence, led by spreading rumour to our town,<BR>
To joust, from different lands came many a knight;<BR>
Mid these (was it his manifest renown,<BR>
Or was it love which so deceived my sight)<BR>
Praise in my eyes alone Zerbino won,<BR>
Who was the mighty king of Scotland&#8217;s son.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When him I after in the field espied,<BR>
Performing wondrous feats of chivalry,<BR>
I was surprised by Love, ere I descried<BR>
That freedom in my Love, so rash a guide,<BR>
I lay this unction to my phantasy,<BR>
That no unseemly place my heart possest,<BR>
Fixed on the worthiest in the world and best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In beauty and in valour&#8217;s boast above<BR>
Those other lords the Scottish prince stood high.<BR>
He showed me, and, I think, be bore me love,<BR>
And left no less an ardent flame than I.<BR>
Nor lacked there one who did between us move,<BR>
To speak our common wishes frequently,<BR>
So could we still in heart and mind unite,<BR>
Although disjoined from one another&#8217;s sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hence, when concluded was the festal show,<BR>
And to his home Zerbino was returned,<BR>
If thou know&#8217;st what is love, thou well may&#8217;st know<BR>
How night and day I for the warrior yearned;<BR>
And was assured, no less on him did prey<BR>
The flame, that in his constant bosom burned.<BR>
He, save a way to have me with him, nought<BR>
For solace of his restless passion sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For different faith forbade him (on my side<BR>
I was a saracen, a Christian he)<BR>
To ask me of my father as a bride,<BR>
By stealth he purposed to elope with me.<BR>
Amid green fields, our wealthy town beside,<BR>
I had a garden, seated by the sea,<BR>
Upon the pleasant shore; from whence the eye<BR>
Might ocean and the hills about descry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A fitting place to effect what different creed<BR>
And law forbade us, he esteemed this site,<BR>
And showed the order taken for the deed,<BR>
Which was to make our future life&#8217;s delight;<BR>
And how, near Santa Martha, for our need,<BR>
A bark was with arm&#8217;d men in ambush dight,<BR>
Under Sir Odoric of Biscay&#8217;s command;<BR>
A leader he, approved by sea and land!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Unable in his person this to do,<BR>
For by his father he was forced to wend<BR>
In succour of the king of France, in lieu<BR>
This Odoric for the purpose he would send;<BR>
Chosen, of all his faithful friends and true,<BR>
As his most faithful and his truest friend:<BR>
And such had been, if benefits could bind<BR>
And goodly deeds the friendship of mankind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;At the time fixed to bear me thence away,<BR>
This chief would anchor on the destined ground.<BR>
&#8212;And thus it was arrived the wished for day,<BR>
Then I of them was in my garden found.<BR>
Sir Odoric, at night, with fair array<BR>
Of valiant men, by land and sea renowned,<BR>
In the near river from his bark descends,<BR>
And thence in silence to my garden wends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To the pitched bark with me his party sped,<BR>
Before the city knew what was at hand;<BR>
Some of the house, disarmed and naked, fled,<BR>
And some were slain; while of the helpless band,<BR>
With me, another part was captive led.<BR>
So was I severed from my native land, <BR>
Hoping in brief Zerbino to possess,<BR>
I cannot tell thee with what happiness.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Scarcely was Mongia by our galley doubled,<BR>
Ere a squall took us on the larboard side,<BR>
Which round about the clear horizon troubled,<BR>
And stirred and tost heaven-high the foaming tide.<BR>
Smote with a north-west wind, next, ocean bubbled,<BR>
Which on her other beam the vessel plied:<BR>
This evermore increases, with such force,<BR>
Starboard or larboard, boots not which our course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;It steads not to strike sail, nor lash the mast,<BR>
Lowered on the gang-board, nor our castles fell;<BR>
The bark, in our despite, is hurried fast<BR>
Towards the pointed rocks about Rochelle:<BR>
Save He, above, assist us at the last,<BR>
The cruel storm will us ashore impel;<BR>
Driven thither by ill wind with mightier speed<BR>
Than ever bow-string gave to whistling reed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Our peril well does the Biscayan note,<BR>
And tries what often has an evil end;<BR>
Lowers down the galley&#8217;s skiff, and, when afloat,<BR>
Descends into it, and makes me descend:<BR>
Two follow, and a troop would throng the boat,<BR>
Did not the first prevent them, and defend<BR>
The entrance with their naked faulchions; we<BR>
Sever the rope forthwith, and put to sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Driven landward, on the shore we safely light<BR>
Who in the skiff embarked; while of our band<BR>
The rest in the split vessel sink outright;<BR>
Our goods sea-swallowed all. Upon the strand<BR>
To Eternal Love, To Goodness Infinite,<BR>
I offer up my thanks, with outstretched hand,<BR>
That I was doomed not &#8217;mid the watery roar<BR>
To perish, nor behold Zerbino more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Though I had left on shipboard matters rare,<BR>
And precious in their nature, gem and vest,<BR>
So I might hope Zerbino&#8217;s lot to share,<BR>
I was content the sea should have the rest.<BR>
No dwelling on the beach appears, nor there<BR>
Is any pathway seen, by footsteps pressed;<BR>
Only a hill, whose woody top is beat<BR>
By ceaseless winds, the waters bathe its feet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Here the fell tyrant Love, aye prompt to range,<BR>
And faithless to his every promise still,<BR>
Who watches ever how he may derange<BR>
And mar our every reasonable will,<BR>
Converts, with woeful and disastrous change,<BR>
My comfort to despair, my good to ill:<BR>
For he, in whom Zerbino put his trust,<BR>
Cooled in his loyal faith, and burned with lust.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whether he his desire had nursed at sea,<BR>
And had not dared exhibit it before;<BR>
Or that it sprung from opportunity,<BR>
Suggested by that solitary shore;<BR>
Without more pause, in that lone desert, he<BR>
Would sate his greedy passion; but forbore<BR>
Till he of one could rid him, of the twain,<BR>
Who in the boat with us had scaped the main.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A man of Scotland he, Almonio hight,<BR>
Who to Zerbino seemed great faith to bear;<BR>
And as a perfect warrior by the knight,<BR>
Praised, when to Odoric given, his trust to share:<BR>
To him (the Spaniard said) it were a slight<BR>
If I unto Rochelle afoot should fare;<BR>
And prayed, that he before would thither speed,<BR>
And forward thence some hackney, for my need.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Almonio, who in this suspects no ill,<BR>
Forthwith, before our party, wends his way<BR>
To the town, hidden by the wooded hill,<BR>
And which not more than six miles distant lay.<BR>
To the other finally his wicked will<BR>
Sir Odoric took courage to display;<BR>
As well because he could not rid him thence,<BR>
As that in him he had great confidence.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He that remained with us, of whom I said<BR>
Before, Corebo was of Bilbao hight,<BR>
Who with him under the same roof was bred<BR>
From infancy, and the ungrateful wight<BR>
Deemed that the thought he harboured in his head,<BR>
He could impart in safety to the knight,<BR>
Who would prefer, neglected of his trust,<BR>
The pleasure of his friend to what was just.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not without high disdain Corebo heard<BR>
(Who kind and courteous was) the Biscayneer,<BR>
And termed him traitor; and by deed and word<BR>
Withstood the purpose of his foul compeer.<BR>
This mighty wrath in either warrior stirred;<BR>
In sign whereof their naked brands they rear.<BR>
At sight of their drawn swords, in panic, I<BR>
Turn shortly through the gloomy wood to fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sir Odoric in war well taught and bred,<BR>
Gained in few blows such vantage in the fray,<BR>
He left Corebo on the field for dead,<BR>
And, following in my steps, pursued my way.<BR>
Love lent to him (unless I am misled)<BR>
Pinions, that he might overtake his prey;<BR>
And many a prayer and glozing flattery taught,<BR>
Wherewith I to compliance might be wrought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But all in vain, for I was fixed and bent,<BR>
Rather than sate his ill desire, to die.<BR>
When menace had by him been vainly spent,<BR>
And every prayer and every flattery,<BR>
He would by open force his will content;<BR>
Nor boots it aught that I entreaties try;&#8212;<BR>
Of his lord&#8217;s faith in him the wretch remind,<BR>
And how myself I to his hands resigned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When I perceived that fruitless was my prayer,<BR>
And that I could not hope for other aid;<BR>
For he assailed me like a famished bear,<BR>
With hands and feet I fierce resistance made,<BR>
As he more brutal waxed, and plucked his hair,<BR>
And with my teeth and nails his visage flayed:<BR>
This while I vent such lamentable cries,<BR>
The clamour echoes to the starry skies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Were they by chance conducted, or my shriek,<BR>
Which might have well been heard a league around,<BR>
(Or, was it they were wont the shore to seek,<BR>
When any vessel split or ran aground)<BR>
I saw a crowd appear upon the peak,<BR>
Which, to the sea descending, towards us wound.<BR>
Them the Biscayan say, and at the sight<BR>
Abandoned his design, and turned to flight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This rabble, sir, against that treacherous man<BR>
Comes to my aid; but in such guise, that I<BR>
The homely saw, of falling from the pan<BR>
Into the fire beneath, but verify.<BR>
&#8217;Tis true so lost I was not, nor that clan<BR>
Accursed with minds of such iniquity,<BR>
That they to violate my person sought;<BR>
Though nothing good or virtuous on them wrought:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But that they knew, for me preserved a maid,<BR>
As yet I am, they higher price might crave.<BR>
Eight months are past, the ninth arrived, since, stayed<BR>
By them, alive I languish in this grave.<BR>
All hope is lost of my Zerbino&#8217;s aid:<BR>
For from their speech I gather, as a slave,<BR>
I am bartered to a merchant for his gold;<BR>
By whom I to the sultan shall be sold.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
The gentle damsel so her tale pursues,<BR>
While sobs and sighs oft interposing break<BR>
Her soft angelic voice, which might infuse<BR>
Compassion into asp, or venomed snake.<BR>
What time she so her piteous grief renews,<BR>
Or haply does her bitter anguish slake,<BR>
Some twenty men the gloomy cavern fill;<BR>
This armed with hunting-spear, and that with bill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
With squinting look and dark, and but one eye,<BR>
The leader of the troop, of brutish cheer<BR>
Was he, the foremost of the company;<BR>
By a blow blinded, which from nose to ear<BR>
Had cleft his jaw: when he did so descry<BR>
Seated beside the maid, that cavalier,<BR>
He turned about and said: &#8220;Lo! in the net<BR>
Another bird for whom it was not set!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Then to the County cried: &#8220;I never knew<BR>
A man more opportune my wants to stead;<BR>
I know not whether any one to you<BR>
Perchance may have announced my pressing need<BR>
Of such fair arms,&#8212;or you conjectured true,&#8212;<BR>
As well as of that goodly sable weed.<BR>
You verily arrived in season are<BR>
My needs (pursued the losel) to repair.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
With bitter smile, upstarting on his feet,<BR>
Orlando to the ruffian made reply:<BR>
&#8220;Thou at a price at which no chapman treat,<BR>
Unmarked in merchant&#8217;s books, these arms shalt buy.&#8221;<BR>
With that he snatched a brand, which, full of heat<BR>
And smoke, was smouldering in the chimney nigh,<BR>
Threw it, and smote by chance the knave half blind,<BR>
Where with the nose the meeting brows confined.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
The brand discharged by him, hit either brow,<BR>
But most severely on the left did smite;<BR>
For that ill feature perished by the blow,<BR>
Which was the thief&#8217;s sole minister of light.<BR>
Nor is the stroke content to blind the foe;<BR>
Unsated, save it register his sprite<BR>
Among those damned souls, whom Charon keeps,<BR>
With their companions, plunged in boiling deeps.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
A spacious table in mid cavern stood,<BR>
Two palms in thickness, in its figure square;<BR>
Propt on one huge, ill fashioned food and rude,<BR>
Which held the thief and all who harboured there.<BR>
Even with such freedom as his dart of wood<BR>
We mark the nimble Spaniard launch through air,<BR>
The heavy table Roland seized and threw,<BR>
Where, crowded close together, stood the crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
One had his belly crushed, and one his breast;<BR>
Another head or arm, or leg and thigh.<BR>
Whence some were slain outright, and maimed the rest,<BR>
While he who was least injured sought to fly.<BR>
&#8217;Tis so sometimes, with heavy stone oppressed,<BR>
A knot of slimy snakes is seen to lie,<BR>
With battered heads and loins where, winter done,<BR>
They lick their scales, rejoicing in the sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
I could not say what mischiefs these offend;<BR>
One dies, and one departs without its tail;<BR>
Another crippled cannot move an-end,<BR>
And wriggling wreathes its length without avail:<BR>
While this, whom more propitious saints befriend,<BR>
Safe through the grass drags off its slimy trail.<BR>
Dire was the stroke; yet should no wonder breed,<BR>
Since good Orlando&#8217;s arm achieved the deed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Those whom the board had little maimed or nought,<BR>
(Turpin says there were seven) in craven wise,<BR>
Their safety in their feet, yet vainly, sought;<BR>
For to the cavern&#8217;s door Orlando hies.<BR>
And having them without resistance caught,<BR>
Fast with a rope their hands behind them ties;<BR>
A rope, which in the cavern on the ground,<BR>
Convenient for his purpose he had found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
He after drags them bound without the cave,<BR>
Where an old service-tree its shadow throws.<BR>
Orlando lops the branches with his glaive,<BR>
And hangs the thieves, a banquet for the crows:<BR>
Nor chain and crook for such a deed did crave:<BR>
For ready hooks the tree itself bestows,<BR>
To purge the world; where by the chin up-hung,<BR>
These, on the branches, bold Orlando strung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
The ancient woman, the assassin&#8217;s friend,<BR>
Escapes when she perceives that all are dead,<BR>
And, threading that green labyrinth without end,<BR>
Laments, and plucks the hair from off her head,<BR>
By fear impelled, through paths which sore offend<BR>
Her feet, till she, beside a river&#8217;s bed,<BR>
Encounters with a warrior: but to say<BR>
Who was the stranger champion I delay;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
And turn to her, who to the count applied,<BR>
Praying he would not leave her there alone,<BR>
And vowed to follow whither he would guide.<BR>
Orlando her consoles in courteous tone:<BR>
And thence, when, with a wreath of roses tied<BR>
About her brows, and robed in purple gown,<BR>
On wonted journey white Aurora starts,<BR>
The paladin with Isabel departs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Without encountering aught that might appear<BR>
Worthy of note, they wended many a day;<BR>
And finally the twain a cavalier,<BR>
As prisoner led, encountered by the way.<BR>
Who shall be told; but, tale to you as dear<BR>
Now calls me from the beaten path away;<BR>
&#8212;Of Aymon&#8217;s daughter,&#8212;whom I left above,<BR>
Languid and lost in all the pains of love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
The beauteous lady who desires in vain,<BR>
Rogero should not his return delay,<BR>
Lies in Marseilles, from whence the paynim train<BR>
She harasses, nigh each returning day;<BR>
(What time they robbing aye, by hill and plain,<BR>
Scower fruitful Languedoc and Provence gay)<BR>
And the true duty executes aright<BR>
Of a sage leader and a valiant knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
The time long past, she, lying in that place,<BR>
Had hoped that her Rogero would appear,<BR>
She, not beholding him in all that space,<BR>
Of many evil chances lived in fear.<BR>
One day, mid others that her woeful case<BR>
The lady wept alone, to her drew near<BR>
The dame, who with that healing ring made sound<BR>
The bosom rankling with Alcina&#8217;s wound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
When her she saw, without her love returned,<BR>
(Such time elapsed, her mission incomplete),<BR>
Sore trembling, faint, and pale, her heart so yearned,<BR>
She scarce had strength to stand upon her feet.<BR>
But the enchantress kind, when she discerned<BR>
Her fear, advanced with smiles the maid to meet;<BR>
And to console her such glad visage wore<BR>
As messenger who joyful tidings bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Fear not for thy Rogero: he is well<BR>
And safe (she cried), and ever worships thee,<BR>
As wonted; but thy foe, that wizard fell,<BR>
Him yet again deprives of liberty.<BR>
And it behoves thee now to climb the sell,<BR>
Would&#8217;st thou posses him, and to follow me;<BR>
For if thou wendest with me, I will lead<BR>
Whither, by thee Rogero shall be freed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
And next pursued, relating to her all<BR>
The frauds and magic of Atlantes hoar,<BR>
That wearing her fair face, who seemed the thrall<BR>
Of an ill giant, him had through the door<BR>
Of gold, enticed into the enchanted hall,<BR>
And after disappeared, the youth before;<BR>
And told how dames and cavaliers he cheats<BR>
Who thither make resort, with like deceits.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Seeing the sage, all think they see a squire,<BR>
Companion, lady-love, or absent friend;<BR>
Whatever is each several wight&#8217;s desire:<BR>
Since to our scope our wishes never tend.<BR>
Hence searching every where, themselves they tire<BR>
With labour sore, and frustrate of their end;<BR>
And cannot, (so Desire and Hope deceive),<BR>
Without the missing good, that palace leave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As soon as thou (pursued the dame) art near<BR>
The place where he has built the magic seat,<BR>
Resembling thy Rogero in his cheer<BR>
And every look, Atlantes thee shall meet,<BR>
And make himself by his ill art appear<BR>
As suffering from some stronger arm defeat;<BR>
That thou may&#8217;st aid him in the peril feigned,<BR>
And thus among those others be detained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To the end thou may&#8217;st escape his ambush, where<BR>
So many and so many, thus betrayed,<BR>
Have fallen; though he Rogero seem, beware<BR>
To lend him faith, who will demand thine aid:<BR>
Nor, when the sage presents himself, forbear<BR>
To take his worthless life with lifted blade.<BR>
Nor think to slay Rogero with the blow,<BR>
But him who works thee still such cruel woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hard will it seem to slay, full well I know,<BR>
The wight, in whom Rogero you descry:<BR>
But, for truth is not in the lying show,<BR>
Trust not to sight where magic blears the eye.<BR>
Fix, ere with me you to the forest go,<BR>
To change not when the traitorous foe is nigh:<BR>
For never shall with you Rogero wive,<BR>
If weakly you the wizard leave alive.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
The valorous maid with the intent to slay<BR>
The false enchanter, on her plan decides,<BR>
Snatches her arms, and follows on her way<BR>
Melissa sage, in whom she so confides,<BR>
And thus, by fruitful field or forest gray,<BR>
Her by forced journeys that enchantress guides;<BR>
And studies to beguile their weary course<BR>
Ever, as best she may, with sweet discourse:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
And as the fairest topic of all those<BR>
Which might be grateful to the damsel&#8217;s ear,<BR>
Her future offspring and Rogero&#8217;s chose<BR>
(A race of demigods) in prince and peer.<BR>
For as Melissa all the secrets knows<BR>
Of the eternal gods who rule our sphere,<BR>
The good enchantress can discover all<BR>
Which should in many ages hence befall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Oh! my best guide.&#8221; exclaimed the damsel bold<BR>
To the weird-woman that to aid her came,<BR>
&#8220;As thou hast many years before foretold<BR>
Men who shall glorify my race and name,<BR>
So now I pray thee, lady, to unfold<BR>
The praise and virtues of some noble dame,<BR>
If from my lineage any such shall rise.&#8221;<BR>
To whom Melissa courteously replies:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Chaste dames of thee descended I survey,<BR>
Mothers of those who wear imperial crown,<BR>
And mighty kings; the column and the stay<BR>
Of glorious realms and houses of renown.<BR>
And as thy sons will shine in arms, so they<BR>
Will no less fame deserve in female gown,<BR>
With piety and sovereign prudence graced,<BR>
And noble hearts, incomparably chaste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if at length, I should relate to thee<BR>
The praise of all who from thy root ascend,<BR>
Too long my tale would hold, nor do I see<BR>
Whom I could pass, where all to fame pretend.<BR>
But from a thousand I some two or three<BR>
Will choose, because my tale may have an end.<BR>
Why was not in the cave thy wish made known,<BR>
Where I their shadows might as well have shown?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To hear of one of thy famed race prepare,<BR>
Whom liberal studies and good works engage;<BR>
Of whom, I know not well, if she more fair<BR>
May be entitled, or more chaste and sage;<BR>
The noble-minded Isabel, who, where<BR>
It stands on Mincius&#8217; bank, in other age<BR>
Shall gild the town, of Ocnus&#8217; mother hight,<BR>
With her own glorious rays by day and night;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Where, with her worthiest consort she will strain,<BR>
In honoured and in splendid rivalry,<BR>
Which best shall prize the virtues&#8217; goodly train,<BR>
And widest ope the gates to courtesy.<BR>
If he by Taro, and in Naples&#8217; reign,<BR>
(&#8217;Tis said), from Gauls delivered Italy,<BR>
&#8217;Twill be replied. Penelope the chaste,<BR>
As such, was not beneath Ulysses placed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Great things and many thus I sum in few<BR>
Of this brave dame, and others leave behind:<BR>
Which when I from the vulgar herd withdrew,<BR>
Sage Merlin from the hollow stone divined.<BR>
For I should leave old Typhis out of view,<BR>
If on such sea I launched before the wind:<BR>
And with this finish my prophetic strain,<BR>
&#8212;All blessings on her head the skies will rain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With her shall be her sister Beatrice,<BR>
Whose fortunes well shall with her name accord;<BR>
Who, while she lives, not only shall not miss<BR>
What good the heavens to those below afford,<BR>
But make, with her, partaker of her bliss,<BR>
First among wealthy dukes, her cherished lord;<BR>
Who shall, when she from hence receives her call,<BR>
Into the lowest depth of misery fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Viscontis&#8217; serpents will be held in dread,<BR>
And Moro and Sforza, while this dame shall be,<BR>
From Hyperborean snows to billows red;<BR>
From Ind to hills, which to a double sea<BR>
Afford a passage; and, the lady dead,<BR>
To the sore mischief of all Italy,<BR>
Will with the Insubri into slavery fall;<BR>
And men shall sovereign wisdom fortune call.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Other the same illustrious name will bear,<BR>
And who will flourish many years before.<BR>
Pannonia&#8217;s garland one of these shall wear.<BR>
Another matron on the Ausonian shore,<BR>
When she shall be released from earthly care,<BR>
Men will among the blessed saints adore;<BR>
With incense will approach the dame divine,<BR>
And hang with votive images her shrine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The others I shall pass in silence by,<BR>
For &#8217;twere too much (as said before) to sound<BR>
Their fame: though each might well deserve, that high<BR>
Heroic trump should in her praise be wound.<BR>
Hence the Biancas and Lucretias I<BR>
And Constances and more reserve; who found,<BR>
Or else repair, upon Italian land,<BR>
Illustrious houses with supporting hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thy race, which shall all else in this excel,<BR>
In the rare fortune of its women thrives;<BR>
Nor of its daughters&#8217; honour more I tell<BR>
Than of the lofty virtue of its wives:<BR>
And that thou may&#8217;st take note of this as well,<BR>
Which Merlin said of thy descendents&#8217; lives,<BR>
(Haply that I the story might narrate)<BR>
This I no little covet to relate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of good Richarda first shall be my strain,<BR>
Mirror of chastity and fortitude,<BR>
Who, young, remains a widow, in disdain<BR>
Of fortune: (that which oft awaits the good)<BR>
Exiles, and cheated of their father&#8217;s reign,<BR>
She shall behold the children of her blood<BR>
Wandering into the clutches of their foe;<BR>
Yet find at last a quittance for her woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor sprung from the ancient root of Aragon,<BR>
I of the gorgeous queen will silent be;<BR>
Than whom more prudent or more chaste is none,<BR>
Renowned in Greek or Latin history;<BR>
Nor who so fortunate a course will run,<BR>
After that, by divine election, she<BR>
Shall with the goodly race of princes swell,<BR>
Alphonso, Hyppolite, and Isabel.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The prudent Eleanour is this: a spray<BR>
Which will be grafted on thy happy tree.<BR>
What of the fruitful stepchild shall I say,<BR>
Who in succession next to her I see,<BR>
Lucretia Borgia? who, from day to day,<BR>
Shall wax in beauty, virtue, chastity,<BR>
And fortune, that like youthful plant will shoot,<BR>
Which into yielding soil has struck its root.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As tin by silver, brass by gold, as Corn-<BR>
Poppy beside the deeply-crimsoning rose,<BR>
Willow by laurel evergreen, as shorn<BR>
Of light, stained glass by gem that richly glows,<BR>
&#8212;So by this dame I honour yet unborn,<BR>
Each hitherto distinguished matron shows;<BR>
For beauty and for prudence claiming place,<BR>
And all praise-worthy excellence and grace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And above every other noble praise,<BR>
Which shall distinguished her alive or dead,<BR>
Is that by her shall be, through kingly ways,<BR>
Her Hercules and other children led;<BR>
Who thus the seeds of worth in early days,<BR>
To bloom in council and in camp, will shed.<BR>
For long wine&#8217;s savour lingers in the wood<BR>
Of the new vessel, whether bad or good.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor the step-daughter of this noble dame,<BR>
Will I, Renata, hight of France, forget,<BR>
Of Louis born, twelfth monarch of his name,<BR>
And Bretagne&#8217;s pride; all virtues ever yet<BR>
Bestowed on woman, since the ruddy flame<BR>
Has warmed, or water had the power to wet,<BR>
Or overhead the circling heavens have rolled,<BR>
United in Renata I behold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Twere long to tell of Alda de Sansogna,<BR>
Or of Celano&#8217;s countess in this string,<BR>
Or Blanche Maria, stiled of Catalonia;<BR>
Or her, the daughter of Sicilia&#8217;s king,<BR>
Or of the beauteous Lippa de Bologna,<BR>
Or more, with whose renown the world shall ring,<BR>
To speak whose separate praise with fitting lore,<BR>
Were to attempt a sea without a shore.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
When of the larger portion of her seed<BR>
The king enchantress at full ease had told,<BR>
And oft and oft rehearsed, amid the rede,<BR>
What arts Rogero to the wizard&#8217;s hold<BR>
Had drawn, Melissa halted near the mead<BR>
Where stood the mansion of Atlantes old,<BR>
Nor would approach the magic dome more nigh,<BR>
Lest her the false magician should espy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
And yet again advised the martial maid,<BR>
(Counsel she had a thousand times bestowed)<BR>
Then left, Nor Bradamant through greenwood shade<BR>
More than two miles in narrow path had rode,<BR>
Before, by two fierce giants overlaid,<BR>
She saw a knight, who like Rogero showed,<BR>
So closely pressed, and labouring sore for breath,<BR>
That he appeared well nigh reduced to death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
When she beheld him in such perilous strait,<BR>
Who of Rogero all the tokens wore,<BR>
She quickly lost the faith she nourished late,<BR>
Quickly her every fair design forbore.<BR>
She weens Melissa bears Rogero hate,<BR>
For some new injury unheard before:<BR>
And with unheard of hate and wrong, her foe<BR>
Would by her hand destroy who loves him so.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
She cried, &#8220;And is not this Rogero, who<BR>
Aye present to my heart, is now to sight?<BR>
If &#8217;tis not him whom I agnize and view.<BR>
Whom e&#8217;er shall I agnize or view aright?<BR>
Why should I other&#8217;s judgment deem more true<BR>
Than the belief that&#8217;s warranted by sight?<BR>
Even without eyes, and by my heart alone,<BR>
If he were near or distant, would be shown.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
While so the damsel thinks, a voice she hears,<BR>
Which, like Rogero&#8217;s, seems for aid to cry;<BR>
At the same time, the worsted knight appears<BR>
To slack the bridle and the rowels ply:<BR>
While at full speed the goaded courser clears<BR>
His ground, pursued by either enemy.<BR>
Nor paused the dame, in following them who sought<BR>
His life, till to the enchanted palace brought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Of which no sooner has she past the door,<BR>
Than she is cheated by the common show.<BR>
Each crooked way or straight her feet explore<BR>
Within it and without, above, below;<BR>
Nor rests she night or day, so strong the lore<BR>
Of the enchanter, who has ordered so,<BR>
She (though they still encounter and confer)<BR>
Knows not Rogero, nor Rogero her.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
But leave we Bradamant, nor grieve, O ye<BR>
Who hear, that she is prisoned by the spell,<BR>
Since her in fitting time I shall set free,<BR>
And good Rogero, from the dome as well,<BR>
As taste is quickened by variety,<BR>
So it appears that, in the things I tell,<BR>
The wider here and there my story ranges,<BR>
It will be found less tedious for its changes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Meseems that I have many threads to clear<BR>
In the great web I labour evermore;<BR>
And therefore be ye not displeased to hear<BR>
How, all dislodged, the squadrons of the Moor,<BR>
Threatening the golden lines loud, appear<BR>
In arms, the royal Agramant before:<BR>
Who bids for a review his army post,<BR>
Willing to know the numbers of his host.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
For besides horse and foot, in the campaign<BR>
Sore thinned, whose numbers were to be supplied,<BR>
Had many captains, and those good, of Spain,<BR>
Of Libya, and of Aethiopia, died;<BR>
And thus the nations, and the various train,<BR>
Wandered without a ruler or a guide.<BR>
To give to each its head and order due,<BR>
The ample camp is mustered in review.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
To fill the squadrons ravaged by the sword,<BR>
In those fierce battles and those conflicts dread,<BR>
This to his Spain, to his Africa that lord,<BR>
Sent to recruit, where well their files they fed;<BR>
And next distributed the paynim horde<BR>
Under their proper captains, ranged and led.<BR>
I, with your leave, till other strain, delay<BR>
The order of the muster to display.</TD></TR>
