<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Another love assails Bireno&#8217;s breast,<BR>
Who leaves one night Olympia on the shore.<BR>
To Logistilla&#8217;s holy realm addressed,<BR>
Rogero goes, nor heeds Alcina more:<BR>
Him, of that flying courser repossest,<BR>
The hippogryph on airy voyage bore:<BR>
Whence he the good Rinaldo&#8217;s levy sees,<BR>
And next Angelica beholds and frees.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
O<SMALL>F</SMALL> all the loves, of all fidelity<BR>
Yet proved, of all the constant hearts and true,<BR>
Of all the lovers, in felicity<BR>
Or sorrow faithful found, a famous crew,<BR>
To Olympia I would give the first degree<BR>
Rather than second: if this be not due,<BR>
I well may say that hers no tale is told<BR>
Of truer love, in present times or old.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
And this she by so many proofs and clear,<BR>
Had made apparent to the Zealand lord,<BR>
No woman&#8217;s faith more certain could appear<BR>
To man, though he her open heart explored:<BR>
And if fair truth such spirits should endear,<BR>
And they in mutual love deserve reward,<BR>
Bireno as himself, nay, he above<BR>
Himself, I say, should kind Olympia love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Not only should he nevermore deceive<BR>
Her for another, were that woman she<BR>
Who so made Europe and wide Asia grieve,<BR>
Or fairer yet, if one more fair there be;<BR>
But rather than quit her the light should leave,<BR>
And what is sweet to taste, touch, hear, and see,<BR>
And life and fame, and all beside; if aught<BR>
More precious can in truth be styled, or thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
If her Bireno loved, as she had loved<BR>
Bireno, if her love he did repay<BR>
With faith like hers, and still with truth unmoved,<BR>
Veered not his shifting sail another way;<BR>
Or ingrate for such service&#8212;cruel proved<BR>
For such fair love and faith, I now will say;<BR>
And you with lips comprest and eye-brows bent,<BR>
Shall listen to the tale for wonderment;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
And when you shall have heard the impiety,<BR>
Which of such passing goodness was the meed,<BR>
Woman take warning from this perfidy,<BR>
And let none make a lover&#8217;s word her creed.<BR>
Mindless that God does all things hear and see,<BR>
The lover, eager his desires to speed,<BR>
Heaps promises and vows, aye prompt to swear,<BR>
Which afterwards all winds disperse in air.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
The promises and empty vows dispersed<BR>
In air, by winds all dissipated go,<BR>
After these lovers have the greedy thirst<BR>
Appeased, with which their fevered palates glow.<BR>
In this example which I offer, versed,<BR>
Their prayers and tears to credit be more slow.<BR>
Cheaply, dear ladies mine, is wisdom bought<BR>
By those who wit at other&#8217;s cost are taught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Of those in the first flower of youth beware,<BR>
Whose visage is so soft and smooth to sight:<BR>
For past, as soon as bred, their fancies are;<BR>
Like a straw fire their every appetite.<BR>
So the keen hunter follows up the hare<BR>
In heat and cold, on shore, or mountain-height;<BR>
Nor, when &#8217;tis taken, more esteems the prize;<BR>
And only hurries after that which flies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Such is the practise of these striplings who,<BR>
What time you treat them with austerity,<BR>
Love and revere you, and such homage do,<BR>
As those who pay their service faithfully;<BR>
But vaunt no sooner victory, than you<BR>
From mistresses shall servants grieve to be;<BR>
And mourn to see the fickle love they owed,<BR>
From you diverted, and elsewhere bestowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
I not for this (for that were wrong) opine<BR>
That you should cease to love; for you, without<BR>
A lover, like uncultivated vine,<BR>
Would be, that has no prop to wind about.<BR>
But the first down I pray you to decline,<BR>
To fly the volatile, inconstant rout;<BR>
To make your choice the riper fruits among,<BR>
Nor yet to gather what too long has hung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
A daughter they have found (above was said)<BR>
Of the proud king who ruled the Friesland state;<BR>
That with Bireno&#8217;s brother was to wed,<BR>
As far as rumour tells; but to relate<BR>
The truth, a longing in Bireno bred<BR>
The sight of food so passing delicate;<BR>
And he to talk his palate deemed would be,<BR>
For other&#8217;s sake, a foolish courtesy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
The gentle damsel had not past fourteen,<BR>
Was beautiful and fresh, and like a rose,<BR>
When this first opening from its bud is seen,<BR>
And with the vernal sun expands and grows.<BR>
To say Bireno loved the youthful queen<BR>
Were little; with less blaze lit tinder glows,<BR>
Or ripened corn, wherever envious hand<BR>
Of foe amid the grain has cast a brand,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Than that which on Bireno&#8217;s bosom fed,<BR>
And to his marrow burned; when, weeping sore<BR>
The fate of her unhappy father dead,<BR>
He saw her bathed in ceaseless tears deplore:<BR>
And, as cold water, on the cauldron shed,<BR>
Shops short the bubbling wave, which boiled before;<BR>
So was the raging rife Olympia blew<BR>
Within his breast, extinguished by a new.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Nor feels Bireno mere satiety;<BR>
He loathes her so, he ill endures her sight;<BR>
And, if his hope he long deferred, will die:<BR>
For other such his fickle appetite!<BR>
Yet till the day prefixed to satisfy<BR>
His fond desire, so feigns the wary knight,<BR>
Olympia less to love than to adore<BR>
He seems, and but her pleasure to explore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
And if the other he too much caress,<BR>
Who cannot but caress her, there are none<BR>
See evil in the deed, but rather guess<BR>
It is in pity, is in goodness done:<BR>
Since to raise up and comfort in distress<BR>
Whom Fortune&#8217;s wheel beats down in changeful run,<BR>
Was never blamed; with glory oftener paid;<BR>
&#8212;So much the more, a young&#8212;a harmless maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Almighty God! how fallible and vain<BR>
Is human judgment, dimmed by clouds obscure!<BR>
Bireno&#8217;s actions, impious and profane,<BR>
By others are reputed just and pure.<BR>
Already stooping to their oars, the train<BR>
Have loosed his vessel from the port secure,<BR>
And with the duke and his companions steer<BR>
For Zealand through the deep, with meery cheer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Already Holland and its headlands all<BR>
Are left astern, and now descried no more;<BR>
Since to shun Friesland they to larboard hawl.<BR>
And keep their course more nigh the Scottish shore:<BR>
When they are overtaken by a squall,<BR>
And drive three days the open sea before:<BR>
Upon the third, when now, near eventide,<BR>
A barren and unpeopled isle is spied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
As soon as they were harboured in a hight,<BR>
Olympia landed and the board was spread;<BR>
She there contented, with the faithless knight,<BR>
Supt, unsuspecting any cause for dread.<BR>
Thence, with Bireno, where a tent was pight<BR>
In pleasant place, repaired, and went to bed.<BR>
The others of their train returned abroad,<BR>
And rested in their ship, in haven moored.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The fear and late sea sorrow, which had weighed<BR>
So long upon the dame and broke her rest,<BR>
The finding herself safe in greenwood shade<BR>
Removed from noise, and, for her tranquil breast<BR>
(Knowing her lover was beside her laid)<BR>
No further thoughts, no further cares molest,<BR>
Olympia lap in slumber so profound,<BR>
No sheltered bear or dormouse sleeps more sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
The lover false, who, hatching treason lies,<BR>
Stole from his bed in silence, when he knew<BR>
She slept: his clothes he in a bundle ties,<BR>
Nor other raiment on his body threw.<BR>
Then issuing forth from the pavilion hies,<BR>
As if on new-born wings, towards his crew;<BR>
Who, roused, unmoor without a cry, as he<BR>
Commands, and loosen thence and put to sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Behind the land was left; and there to pine<BR>
Olympia, who yet slept the woods among;<BR>
Till from her gilded wheels the frosty rhine<BR>
Aurora upon earth beneath had flung;<BR>
And the old woe, beside the tumbling brine,<BR>
Lamenting, halcyons mournful descant sung;<BR>
When she, &#8217;twixt sleep and waking, made a strain<BR>
To reach her loved Bireno, but in vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
She no one found: the dame her arm withdrew;<BR>
She tried again, yet no one found; she spread<BR>
Both arms, now here, now there, and sought anew;<BR>
Now either leg; but yet no better sped.<BR>
Fear banished sleep; she oped her eyes: in view<BR>
Was nothing: she no more her widowed bed<BR>
Would keep, but from the couch in fury sprung,<BR>
And headlong forth from the pavilion flung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
And seaward ran, her visage tearing sore,<BR>
Presaging, and now certain of her plight:<BR>
She beat her bosom, and her tresses tore,<BR>
And looked (the moon was shining) if she might<BR>
Discover any thing beside the shore;<BR>
Nor, save the shore, was any thing in sight.<BR>
She calls Bireno, and the caverns round,<BR>
Pitying her grief, Bireno&#8217;s name rebound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
On the far shore there rose a rock; below<BR>
Scooped by the breaker&#8217;s beating frequently:<BR>
The cliff was hollowed underneath, in show<BR>
Of arch, and overhung the foaming sea.<BR>
Olympia (MIND such vigour did bestow)<BR>
Sprang up the frowning crest impetuously,<BR>
And, at a distance, stretched by favouring gale,<BR>
Thence saw her cruel lord&#8217;s departing sail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Saw it, or seemed to see: for ill her eyes,<BR>
Things through the air, yet dim and hazy, view.<BR>
She falls, all-trembling, on the ground, and lies<BR>
With face than snow more cold and white in hue:<BR>
But when she has again found strength to rise,<BR>
Guiding her voice towards the bark which flew,<BR>
Calling with all her might, the unhappy dame<BR>
Calls often on her cruel consort&#8217;s name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Where unavailing was the feeble note,<BR>
She wept and clapt her hands in agony.<BR>
&#8220;Without its freight,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;thy ship does float.<BR>
&#8212;Where, cruel, dost thou fly so swiftly?&#8212;Me<BR>
Receive as well:&#8212;small hinderance to thy boat,<BR>
Which bears my spirit, would my body be.&#8221;<BR>
And she her raiment waving in her hand,<BR>
Signed to the frigate to return to land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
But the loud wind which, sweeping ocean, bears<BR>
The faithless stripling&#8217;s sail across the deep,<BR>
Bears off as well the shriek, and moan, and prayers<BR>
Of sad Olympia, sorrowing on the steep.<BR>
Thrice, cruel to herself, the dame prepares<BR>
From the high rock amid the waves to leap.<BR>
But from the water lifts at length her sight,<BR>
And there returns where she had passed the night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Stretched on the bed, upon her face she lay,<BR>
Bathing it with her tears. &#8220;Last night in thee<BR>
Together two found shelter,&#8221; did she say;<BR>
&#8220;Alas! why two together are not we<BR>
At rising? False Bireno! cursed day<BR>
That I was born! What here remains to me<BR>
To do? What can be done?&#8212;Alone, betrayed&#8212;<BR>
Who will console me, who afford me aid?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor man I see, nor see I work, which shows<BR>
That man inhabits in this isle; nor I<BR>
See ship, in which (a refuge from my woes),<BR>
Embarking, I from hence may hope to fly.<BR>
Here shall I starve; nor any one to close<BR>
My eyes, or give me sepulture, be by,<BR>
Save wolf perchance, who roves this wood, a tomb<BR>
Give me, alas! in his voracious womb.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I live in terror, and appear to see<BR>
Rough bear or lion issue even now,<BR>
Or tiger, from beneath the greenwood tree,<BR>
Or other beast with teeth and claws: but how<BR>
Can ever cruel beast inflict on me,<BR>
O cruel beast, a fouler death than thou?<BR>
Enough for them to slay me once! while I<BR>
Am made by thee a thousand deaths to die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But grant, e&#8217;en now, some skipper hither fare,<BR>
Who may for pity bear me hence away;<BR>
And that I so eschew wolf, lion, bear,<BR>
Torture, and dearth, and every horrid way<BR>
Of death; to Holland shall he take me, where<BR>
For thee is guarded fortilage and bay;<BR>
Or take me to the land where I was born,<BR>
If this thou hast from me by treachery torn?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou, with pretence, from me my state didst wrest<BR>
Of our connection and of amity;<BR>
And quickly of my land thy troops possest,<BR>
To assure the rule unto thyself. Shall I<BR>
Return to Flanders where I sold the rest,<BR>
Though little, upon which I lived, to buy<BR>
Thee needful succour and from prison bear?<BR>
Wretch, whither shall I go?&#8212;I know not where.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Can I to Friesland go, where I to reign<BR>
As queen was called, and this for thee forewent;<BR>
Where both my brethren and my sire were slain,<BR>
And every other good from me was rent?&#8212;<BR>
Thee would I not, thou ingrate, with my pain<BR>
Reproach, not therefore deal thee punishment:<BR>
As well as I, the story dost thou know;<BR>
Now, see the meed thou dost for this bestow!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Oh! may I but escape the wild corsair,<BR>
Nor taken be, and after sold for slave!<BR>
Rather than this may lion, wolf, or bear,<BR>
Tiger, or other beast, if fiercer rave,<BR>
Me with his claws and rushes rend and tear,<BR>
And drag my bleeding body to his cave.&#8221;<BR>
So saying she her golden hair offends,<BR>
And lock by lock the scattered tresses rends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
She to the shore&#8217;s extremest verge anew,<BR>
Tossing her head, with hair dishevelled, run;<BR>
And seemed like maid beside herself, and who<BR>
Was by ten fiends possessed, instead of one;<BR>
Of like the frantic Hecuba, at view<BR>
Of murdered Polydore, her infant son;<BR>
Fixed on a stone she gazed upon the sea,<BR>
Nor less than real stone seemed stone to be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
But let her grieve till my return. To show<BR>
Now of the Child I wish: his weary way<BR>
Rogero, in the noon&#8217;s intensest glow,<BR>
Takes by the shore: the burning sunbeams play<BR>
Upon the hill and thence rebound; below<BR>
Boils the white sand; while heated with the ray,<BR>
Little is wanting in that journey dire,<BR>
But that the arms he wears are all on fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
While to the warrior thirst and labour sore,<BR>
Still toiling through that heavy sand, as he<BR>
Pursued his path along the sunny shore,<BR>
Were irksome and displeasing company,<BR>
Beneath the shadow of a turret hoar,<BR>
Which rose beside the beach, amid the sea,<BR>
He found three ladies of Alcina&#8217;s court,<BR>
As such distinguished by their dress and port.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Reclined on Alexandrian carpets rare<BR>
The ladies joyed the cool in great delight;<BR>
About them various wines in vessels were,<BR>
And every sort of comfit nicely dight;<BR>
Fast by, and sporting with the ripple there,<BR>
Lay, waiting on their needs, a pinnace light,<BR>
Until a breeze should fill her sail anew:<BR>
For then no breath upon the waters blew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
They, who beheld along the shifting sand<BR>
Rogero wend, upon his way intent,<BR>
And saw thirst figured on his lips, and scanned<BR>
His troubled visage, all with sweat besprent,<BR>
Began to pray, &#8216;on what he had in hand<BR>
He would not show his heart so deeply bent,<BR>
But that he in the cool and grateful shade<BR>
Would rest his weary limbs, beside them laid.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
To hold the stirrup one approaching near,<BR>
Would aid him to alight: the other bore<BR>
A cup of chrystal to the cavalier,<BR>
With foaming wine, which raised his thirst the more;<BR>
But to the music of their speech no ear<BR>
He lent, who weened if he his way forbore<BR>
For anything, each lett would time supply<BR>
To Alcina to arrive, who now was nigh.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Now so saltpetre fine and sulphur pure,<BR>
Touched with the fiery spark, blaze suddenly;<BR>
Not so loud ocean raves, when the obscure<BR>
Whirlwind descends and camps in middle sea,<BR>
As viewing thus the knight proceed secure<BR>
Upon his journey, and aware that he<BR>
Scorns them, who yet believe they beauteous are,<BR>
Kindled the third of those three damsels fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
As loud as she could raise her voice, she said,<BR>
&#8220;Thou art not gentle, nor art thou a knight;<BR>
And hast from other arms and horse conveyed:<BR>
Which never could be thine by better right.<BR>
So be thy theft, if well I guess, appaid<BR>
By death, which this may worthily requite!<BR>
Foul thief, churl, haughty ingrate, may I thee<BR>
Burned, gibbeted, or cut in quarters see!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
Beside all these and more injurious cries,<BR>
Which the proud damsel at the warrior throws,<BR>
Though to her taunts Rogero nought replies,<BR>
Who weens small fame from such a contest flows;<BR>
She with her sisters to the frigate hies,<BR>
Which waits them, and aboard the tender goes;<BR>
And plying fast her oars, pursues the knight<BR>
Along the sandy beach, still kept in sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
On him with threat and curse she ever cried;<BR>
Whose tongue collected still fresh cause for blame.<BR>
Meanwhile, where to the lovelier fairy&#8217;s side<BR>
The passage lay across a straight, he came;<BR>
And there an ancient ferryman espied<BR>
Put from the other shore with punctual aim,<BR>
As if forewarned and well prepared, the seer<BR>
Waited the coming of the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
The ferryman put forth the Child to meet,<BR>
To bear him to a better shore rejoicing: he<BR>
Appeared as all benign and all discreet,<BR>
If of the heart the face is warranty.<BR>
Giving God thanks, Rogero took his seat<BR>
Aboard the bark, and passed the quiet sea,<BR>
Discoursing with that ancient pilot, fraught<BR>
With wisdom, and by long experience taught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
He praised Rogero much, that he had fled<BR>
In time from false Alcina, and before<BR>
To him the dame had given the chalice dread,<BR>
Her lover&#8217;s final guerdon evermore.<BR>
Next that he had to Logistilla sped,<BR>
Where he should duly witness holy lore,<BR>
And beauty infinite and grace enjoy,<BR>
Which feed and nourish hearts they never cloy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her shall you, struck with wonderment, revere,&#8221;<BR>
(He said), &#8220;when first you shall behold the fay;<BR>
But better contemplate her lofty cheer,<BR>
And you no other treasure shall appay.<BR>
In this her love from other differs; fear<BR>
And hope in other on the bosom prey:<BR>
In hers Desire demands not aught beside,<BR>
And with the blessing seen is satisfied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You shall in nobler studies be professed,<BR>
Tutored by her, than bath and costly fare,<BR>
Song, dance, and perfumes; as how fashioned best,<BR>
Your thoughts may tower more high than hawks in air;<BR>
And how some of the glory of the blest<BR>
You here may in the mortal body share.&#8221;<BR>
So speaking, and yet distant from the shore,<BR>
To the safe bank approached the pilot hoar.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
When he beholds forth-issuing from the strand,<BR>
A fleet of ships, which all towards him steer.<BR>
With these came wronged Alcina, with a band<BR>
Of many vassals, gathered far and near;<BR>
To risk the ruin of herself and land,<BR>
Or repossess the thing she held so dear.<BR>
Love, no light cause, incites the dame aggrieved,<BR>
Nor less the bitter injury received.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Such choler she had never felt before<BR>
As that which now upon her bosom fed:<BR>
And hence she made her followers ply the oar<BR>
Till the white foam on either bank was shed<BR>
The deafening noise and din o&#8217;er sea and shore,<BR>
By echo every where repeated, spread,<BR>
&#8220;Now&#8212;now, Rogero, bare the magic shield,<BR>
Or in the strife be slain, or basely yield:&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Thus Logistilla&#8217;s pilot; and beside,<BR>
So saying, seized the pouch, wherein was dight<BR>
The buckler, and the covering torn aside,<BR>
Exposed to open view the shining light.<BR>
The enchanted splendor, flashing far and wide,<BR>
So sore offends the adversaries&#8217; sight,<BR>
They from their vessels drop amazed and blind,<BR>
Tumbling from prow before, and poop behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
One who stood sentry on the citadel<BR>
Descried the navy of the invading dame,<BR>
And backwards rang the castle larum-bell,<BR>
Whence speedy succours to the haven came.<BR>
The artillery rained like storm, whose fury fell<BR>
On all who would Rogero scathe and shame:<BR>
So that such aid was brought him in the strife,<BR>
As saved the warrior&#8217;s liberty and life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Four ladies are arrived upon the strand,<BR>
Thither by Logistilla sped in haste:<BR>
Leagued with the valiant Anrondica stand<BR>
Fronesia sage, Dicilla good, and chaste<BR>
Sofrosina, who, as she has in had<BR>
More than the others, &#8217;mid the foremost placed,<BR>
Conspicuous flames. Forth issues from the fort<BR>
A matchless host, and files towards the port.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Beneath the castle, safe from wind and swell,<BR>
Of many ships and stout, a squadron lay;<BR>
Which, in the harbour, at a sound from bell,&#8212;<BR>
A word, were fit for action, night or day;<BR>
And thus by land and sea was battle, fell<BR>
And furious, waged on part of either fay:<BR>
Whence was Alcina&#8217;s realm turned upside down,<BR>
Of which she had usurped her sister&#8217;s crown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Oh! of how many battles the success<BR>
Is different from what was hoped before!<BR>
Not only failed the dame to repossess, <BR>
As thought, her lover flying from her shore,<BR>
But out of ships, even now so numberless,<BR>
That ample ocean scarce the navy bore,<BR>
From all her vessels, to the flames a prey,<BR>
But with one bark escaped the wretched fay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Alcina flies; and her sad troop around<BR>
Routed and taken, burnt or sunk, remains<BR>
To have lost Rogero, sorrow more profound<BR>
Wakes in her breast than all her other pains;<BR>
And she in bitter tears for ever drowned,<BR>
Of the Child&#8217;s loss by night and day complains;<BR>
And bent to end her woes, with many a sigh,<BR>
Often laments her that she cannot die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
No fairy dies, or can, while overhead<BR>
The sun shall burn, or heaven preserve their stile,<BR>
Or Clotho had been moved to cut her thread,<BR>
Touched by such grief; or, as on funeral pile<BR>
Fair Dido, she beneath the steel had bled;<BR>
Or, haply, like the gorgeous Queen of Nile,<BR>
In mortal slumber would have closed her eye:<BR>
But fairies cannot at their pleasure die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Return we, where eternal fame is due,<BR>
Leaving Alcina in her trouble sore:<BR>
I speak of valorous Rogero, who<BR>
Had disembarked upon the safer shore.<BR>
He turned his back upon the waters blue,<BR>
Giving God thanks for all with pious lore;<BR>
And on dry ground now landed, made repair<BR>
Towards the lofty castle planted there.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Than this a stronger or more bright in show<BR>
Was never yet before of mortal sight,<BR>
Or after, viewed; with stones the ramparts glow<BR>
More rich than carbuncle or diamond bright.<BR>
We of like gems discourse not here below,<BR>
And he who would their nature read aright<BR>
Must thither speed: none such elsewhere, I ween,<BR>
Except perhaps in heaven above, are seen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
What gives to them superiority<BR>
O&#8217;er every other sort of gem, confessed,<BR>
Is, man in these his very soul may see;<BR>
His vices and his virtues see expressed.<BR>
Hence shall he after heed no flattery,<BR>
Nor yet by wrongful censure be depressed.<BR>
His form he in the lucid mirror eyes,<BR>
And by the knowledge of himself grows wise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Their rays, which imitate the sunshine, fill<BR>
All round about with such a flood of light,<BR>
That he who has them, Ph&#339;bus, may at will<BR>
Create himself a day, in thy despite.<BR>
Nor only marvellous the gems; the skill<BR>
Of the artificer and substance bright<BR>
So well contend for mastery, of the two,<BR>
&#8217;Tis hard to judge where preference is due.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
On arches raised, whereon the firmament<BR>
Seemed to repose as props, so fair in show<BR>
Are lovely gardens, and of such extent,<BR>
As even would be hard to have below.<BR>
Clustering &#8217;twixt lucid tower or battlement,<BR>
Green odoriferous shrubs are seen to grow,<BR>
Which through the summer and the winter shoot,<BR>
And teem with beauteous blossom and ripe fruit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Never in any place such goodly tree<BR>
Is grown, except within these gardens fine;<BR>
Or rose, or violet of like quality,<BR>
Lilies, or amaranth, or jessamine.<BR>
Elsewhere it seems as if foredoomed to be<BR>
Born with one sun, to live and to decline,<BR>
Upon its widowed stalk the blossom dies,<BR>
Subject to all the changes of the skies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
But here the verdure still is permanent,<BR>
Still permanent the eternal blossoms are;<BR>
Not that kind nature, in her government,<BR>
So nicely tempers here the genial air,<BR>
But that, unneeding any influence lent<BR>
By planet, Logistilla&#8217;s zeal and care<BR>
Ever keep fast (what may appear a thing<BR>
Impossible) her own perpetual spring.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
That such a gentle lord had sought her rest,<BR>
Did much the prudent Logistilla please,<BR>
And she commanded he should be carest,<BR>
And all should seek to do him courtesies.<BR>
Sometime had Sir Astolpho been her guest,<BR>
Whom with a joyful heart Rogero sees.<BR>
There in few days resorted all the crew,<BR>
Changed by Melissa to their shapes anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
When they a day or more their weariness<BR>
Had eased, Rogero sought the prudent fay;<BR>
With him the duke Astolpho, who no less<BR>
Desired to measure back his western way.<BR>
Melissa was for both embassadress,<BR>
And for the warlike pair, with humble say<BR>
To favour, warn and help them, prayed the dame;<BR>
So that they might return from whence they came.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I&#8221; (said the fay) &#8220;will think upon this need,<BR>
And in two days the pair will expedite.&#8221;<BR>
Then thought how good Rogero she should speed.<BR>
And afterwards how aid the English knight.<BR>
She wills the first shall, on the griffin-steed,<BR>
To the Aquitanian shores direct his flight;<BR>
But first will fashion for the flying-horse<BR>
A bit, to guide him and restrain his course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
She shows him what to do, if he on high<BR>
Would make him soar, or down to earth would bring,<BR>
And what, would he in circles make him fly,<BR>
Or swiftly speed, or pause upon the wing.<BR>
And all that skilful horsemen use to try<BR>
Upon plain ground, beneath her tutoring,<BR>
Rogero learned in air, and gained dominion<BR>
Over the griffin-steed of soaring pinion.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
When at all points Rogero was prepared,<BR>
He bade farewell to the protecting fay,<BR>
For ever to the loving knight endeared,<BR>
And issued from her realm upon his way.<BR>
I first of him, who on his journey fared<BR>
In happy hour, and afterwards shall say<BR>
Of the English knight, who spent more time and pain<BR>
Seeking the friendly court of Charlemagne.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Rogero thence departs; but as before<BR>
Takes not the way he took in his despite,<BR>
When him above the sea the courser bore,<BR>
And seldom was the land beneath in sight.<BR>
But taught to make him beat his wings and soar,<BR>
Here, there, as liked him best, with docile flight,<BR>
Returning, he another path pursued;<BR>
As Magi erst, who Herod&#8217;s snare eschewed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Borne hither, good Rogero, leaving Spain,<BR>
Had sought, in level line, the Indian lands,<BR>
Where they are watered by the Eastern main;<BR>
Where the two fairies strove with hostile bands.<BR>
He now resolved to visit other reign<BR>
Than that where Aeolus his train commands;<BR>
And finish so the round he had begun,<BR>
Circling the world beneath him like the sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Here the Cat&agrave;y, and there he Mangiane,<BR>
Passing the great Quinsay beheld; in air<BR>
Above Imavus turned, and Sericane<BR>
Left on the right; and thence did ever bear<BR>
From the north Scythians to the Hyrcanian main:<BR>
So reached Sarmatia&#8217;s distant land; and, where<BR>
Europe and Asia&#8217;s parted climes divide,<BR>
Russ, Prussian, he and Pomeranian spied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Although the Child by every wish was pressed<BR>
Quickly to seek his Bradamant, yet he<BR>
With taste of roving round the world possest,<BR>
Would not desist from it, till Hungary<BR>
He had seen; and Polacks, Germans, and the rest<BR>
Should in his wide extended circuit see,<BR>
Inhabiting that horrid, northern land;<BR>
And came at last to England&#8217;s farthest strand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Yet think not, sir, that in so long a flight,<BR>
The warrior is for ever on the wing.<BR>
Who lodges, housed in tavern every night,<BR>
As best as can, through his capacious ring.<BR>
So nights and days he passes: such delight<BR>
Prospects to him of land and ocean bring.<BR>
Arrived one morn nigh London-town, he stopt;<BR>
And over Thames the flying courser dropt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Where he in meadows to the city nigh<BR>
Saw troops of men at arms, and footmen spread;<BR>
Who, to the drum and trumpet marching by,<BR>
Divided into goodly bands, were led<BR>
Before Rinaldo, flower of chivalry;<BR>
He that (if you remember it) was said<BR>
To have been sent by Charlemagne, and made<BR>
His envoy to these parts in search of aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Rogero came exactly as the show<BR>
Of that fair host was made without the town,<BR>
And of a knight the occasion sought to know;<BR>
But from the griffin-horse first lighted down:<BR>
And he who courteous was, informed him how<BR>
Of kingdoms holding of the British crown,<BR>
English, Scotch, Irish, and the Islands nigh,<BR>
Those many banners were, upreared on high:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
And added, having ended this display<BR>
Of arms, the troops would file towards the strand,<BR>
Where vessels anchored in the harbour lay,<BR>
Waiting to bear them to another land.<BR>
&#8220;The French beseiged, rejoice in this array,<BR>
And hope (he said) deliverance through the band.<BR>
But that I may of all inform you well,<BR>
I of each troop shall separately tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lo! where yon mighty banner planted stands,<BR>
Which pards and flower-de-luces does unfold,<BR>
That our great captain to the wind expands,<BR>
Under whose ensign are the rest enrolled:<BR>
The warrior&#8217;s name, renowned throughout these lands,<BR>
Is Leonetto, flower of all the bold;<BR>
Lancaster&#8217;s duke, and nephew to the king,<BR>
Valiant in war, and wise in counselling.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That next the royal gonfalon, which stirred<BR>
By fluttering wind, is borne towards the mount,<BR>
Which on green field, three pinions of a bird<BR>
Bears agent, speaks Sir Richard, Warwick&#8217;s count.<BR>
The Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s blazon is the third,<BR>
Two antlers of a stag, and demi-front;<BR>
The Duke of Clarence shows a torch, and he<BR>
Is Duke of York who bears that verdant tree.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Upon the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s gonfalon<BR>
You see a lance into three pieces broke;<BR>
The thunder on the Earl of Kent&#8217;s; upon<BR>
Pembroke&#8217;s a griffin; underneath a yoke;<BR>
In Essex&#8217;s, conjoined, two snakes are shown:<BR>
By yonder lifted balance is bespoke<BR>
The Duke of Suffolk; and Northumbria&#8217;s Earl<BR>
A garland does on azure field unfurl.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Arundel&#8217;s Earl is yonder cavalier,<BR>
Whose banner bears a foundering bark! In sight<BR>
The next, is Berkeley&#8217;s noble Marquis; near<BR>
Are March and Richmond&#8217;s Earls: the first on white<BR>
Shows a cleft mount; a palm the second peer;<BR>
A pine amid the waves the latter knight.<BR>
The next of Dorset and Southampton&#8217;s town,<BR>
Are earls; this bears a car, and that a crown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The valiant Raymond, Earl of Devon, bears<BR>
The hawk, which spreads her wings above her nest;<BR>
While or and sable he of Worcester wears:<BR>
Derby&#8217;s a dog, a bear is Oxford&#8217;s crest.<BR>
There, as his badge, a cross of chrystal rears<BR>
Bath&#8217;s wealthy prelate, camped among the rest.<BR>
The broken seat on dusky field, next scan,<BR>
Of Somerset&#8217;s good duke, Sir Ariman.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Forty-two thousand muster in array,<BR>
The men at arms and mounted archers there.<BR>
By a hundred I misreckon not, or they,<BR>
The fighting footmen, twice as many are.<BR>
Those ensigns yellow, brown, and green, survey,<BR>
And that striped blue and black. The foot repair<BR>
Each to his separate flag where these are spread;<BR>
By Godfrey, Henry, Hermant, Edward, led.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The first is the Duke of Buckingham; and he,<BR>
The next, is Henry, Earl of Salisbury;<BR>
Old Hermant Aberga&#8217;nny hold in fee,<BR>
That Edward is the Earl of Shrewsbury.<BR>
In those who yonder lodge, the English see<BR>
Camped eastward; and now westward turn your eye,<BR>
Where you shall thirty thousand Scots, a crew<BR>
Led by their monarch&#8217;s son, Zerbino, view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The lion &#8217;twixt two unicorns behold<BR>
Upon the standard of the Scottish king!<BR>
Which has a sword of silver in its hold.<BR>
There camps his son: of all his following<BR>
Is none so beauteous: nature broke the mould<BR>
In which she cast him, after fashioning<BR>
Her work: Is none in whom such chivalry<BR>
And valour shines. The Duke of Rothsay he!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Behold the Earl of Huntley&#8217;s flag display<BR>
Upon an azure field a gilded bar:<BR>
In that a leopard in the toils survey,<BR>
The bearing of the noble Duke of Mar.<BR>
With many birds, and many colours gay,<BR>
See Alcabrun&#8217;s, a valiant man in war;<BR>
Who neither duke, nor count, nor marquis hight,<BR>
Is in his savage country first of right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The Duke of Strathforth shows the bird, who strains<BR>
His daring eyes to keep the sun in view;<BR>
The Earl Lurcanio, that in Angus reigns,<BR>
A bull, whose flanks are torn by deerhounds two.<BR>
See there the Duke of Albany, who stains<BR>
His ensign&#8217;s field with colours white and blue.<BR>
The Earl of Buchan next his banner bears,<BR>
In which a dragon vert a vulture tears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Herman, the lord of Forbes, conducts that band,<BR>
And stripes his gonfalon with black and white;<BR>
With Errol&#8217;s earl upon his better hand,<BR>
Who on a field of green displays a light.<BR>
Now see the Irish, next the level land,<BR>
Into two squadrons ordered for the fight.<BR>
Kildare&#8217;s redoubted earl commands the first;<BR>
Lord Desmond leads the next, in mountains nursed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;A burning pine by Kildare is displayed;<BR>
By Desmond on white field a crimson bend.<BR>
Nor only England, Scotland, Ireland, aid<BR>
King Charlemagne; but to assist him wend<BR>
The Swede and Norse, and succours are conveyed<BR>
From Thule, and the farthest Iceland&#8217;s end.<BR>
All lands that round them lie, in fine, increase<BR>
His host, by nature enemies to peace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Issued from cavern and from forest brown,<BR>
They sixteen thousand are, or little less;<BR>
Visage, legs, arms, and bosom overgrown<BR>
With hair, like beasts. Lo! yonder, where they press<BR>
About a standard white, the level down<BR>
Of lances seems a bristling wilderness.<BR>
Such Moray&#8217;s flag, the savage squadron&#8217;s head,<BR>
Who means with Moorish blood to paint it red.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
What time Rogero sees the fair array,<BR>
Whose bands to succour ravaged France prepare,<BR>
And notes and talks of ensigns they display,<BR>
And names of British lords, to him repair<BR>
One and another, crowding to survey<BR>
His courser, single of its kind, or rare:<BR>
All thither hasten, wondering and astound,<BR>
And compassing the warrior, form a round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
So that to raise more wonder in the train.<BR>
And to make better sport, as him they eyed,<BR>
Rogero shook the flying courser&#8217;s rein,<BR>
And lightly with the rowels touched his side:<BR>
He towards heaven, uprising, soared amain,<BR>
And left behind each gazer stupefied.<BR>
Having from end to end the English force<BR>
So viewed, he next for Ireland shaped his course;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
And saw fabulous Hibernia, where<BR>
The goodly, sainted elder made the cave,<BR>
In which men cleansed from all offences are;<BR>
Such mercy there, it seems, is found to save.<BR>
Thence o&#8217;er that sea he spurred, through yielding air,<BR>
Whose briny waves the lesser Britain lave;<BR>
And, looking down, Angelica descried<BR>
In passing, to the rock with fetters tied;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Bound to the naked rock upon the strand,<BR>
In the isle of tears; for the isle of tears was hight,<BR>
That which was peopled by the inhuman band,<BR>
So passing fierce and full of foul despite;<BR>
Who (as I told above) on every hand<BR>
Cruized with their scattered fleet by day or night;<BR>
And every beauteous woman bore away,<BR>
Destined to be a monster&#8217;s evil prey:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
There but that morning bound in cruel wise;<BR>
Where (to devour a living damsel sped)<BR>
The orc, that measureless sea-monster, hies,<BR>
Which on abominable food is fed.<BR>
How on the beach the maid became the prize<BR>
Of the rapacious crew, above was said,<BR>
Who found her sleeping near the enchanter hoar,<BR>
Who her had thither brought by magic lore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
The cruel and inhospitable crew<BR>
To the voracious beast the dame expose<BR>
Upon the sea-beat shore, as bare to view<BR>
As nature did at first her work compose.<BR>
Not even a veil she had, to shade the hue<BR>
Of the white lily and vermillion rose,<BR>
Which mingled in her lovely members meet,<BR>
Proof to December-snow and July-heat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Her would Rogero have some statue deemed<BR>
Of alabaster made, or marble rare,<BR>
Which to the rugged rock so fastened seemed<BR>
By the industrious sculptor&#8217;s cunning care,<BR>
But that he saw distinct a tear which streamed<BR>
Amid fresh-opening rose and lily fair,<BR>
Stand on her budding paps beneath in dew,<BR>
And that her golden hair dishevelled flew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
And as he fastened his on her fair eyes,<BR>
His Bradamant he called to mind again.<BR>
Pity and love within his bosom rise<BR>
At once, and ill he can from tears refrain:<BR>
And in soft tone he to the damsel cries,<BR>
(When he has checked his flying courser&#8217;s rein)<BR>
&#8220;O lady, worthy but that chain to wear,<BR>
With which Love&#8217;s faithful servants fettered are,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And most unworthy this or other ill,<BR>
What wretch has had the cruelty to wound<BR>
And gall those snowy hands with livid stain,<BR>
Thus painfully with griding fetters bound?&#8221;<BR>
At this she cannot choose but show like grain,<BR>
Of crimson spreading on an ivory ground;<BR>
Knowing those secret beauties are espied,<BR>
Which, howsoever lovely, shame would hide;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
And gladly with her hands her face would hood,<BR>
Were they not fastened to the rugged stone:<BR>
But with her tears (for this at least she could)<BR>
Bedewed it, and essayed to hold it down.<BR>
Sobbing some while the lovely damsel stood;<BR>
Then loosed her tongue and spake in feeble tone;<BR>
But ended not; arrested in mid-word,<BR>
By a loud noise which in the sea was heard.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Lo! and behold! the unmeasured-beast appears,<BR>
Half surging and half hidden, in such sort<BR>
As sped by roaring wind long carack steers<BR>
From north or south, towards her destined port.<BR>
So the sea monster to his food repairs:<BR>
And now the interval between is short.<BR>
Half dead the lady is through fear endured,<BR>
Ill by that other&#8217;s comfort reassured.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Rogero overhand, not in the rest<BR>
Carries his lance, and beats, with downright blow,<BR>
The monstrous orc. What this resembled best,<BR>
But a huge, writhing mass, I do not know;<BR>
Which wore no form of animal exprest,<BR>
Save in the head, with eyes and teeth of sow.<BR>
His forehead, &#8217;twixt the eyes, Rogero smites,<BR>
But as on steel or rock the weapon lights.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
When he perceives the first of no avail,<BR>
The knight returns to deal a better blow;<BR>
The orc, who sees the shifting shadow sail<BR>
Of those huge pinions on the sea below,<BR>
In furious heat, deserts his sure regale<BR>
On shore, to follow that deceitful show:<BR>
And rolls and reels behind it, as it fleets.<BR>
Rogero drops, and oft the stroke repeats.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
As eagle, that amid her downward flight,<BR>
Surveys amid the grass a snake unrolled,<BR>
Or where she smoothes upon a sunny height,<BR>
Her ruffled plumage, and her scales of gold,<BR>
Assails it not where prompt with poisonous bite<BR>
To hiss and creep; but with securer hold<BR>
Gripes it behind, and either pinion clangs,<BR>
Lest it should turn and wound her with its fangs;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
So the fell orc Rogero does not smite<BR>
With lance or faulchion where the tushes grow,<BR>
But aims that &#8217;twixt the ears his blow may light;<BR>
Now on the spine, or now on tail below.<BR>
And still in time descends or soars upright,<BR>
And shifts his course, to cheat the veering foe:<BR>
But as if beating on a jasper block,<BR>
Can never cleave the hard and rugged rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
With suchlike warfare is the mastiff vext<BR>
By the bold fly in August&#8217;s time of dust,<BR>
Or in the month before or in the next,<BR>
This full of yellow spikes and that of must;<BR>
For ever by the circling plague perplext,<BR>
Whose sting into his eyes or snout is thrust:<BR>
And oft the dog&#8217;s dry teeth are heard to fall;<BR>
But reaching once the foe, he pays for all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
With his huge tail the troubled waves so sore<BR>
The monster beats, that they ascend heaven-high;<BR>
And the knight knows not if he swim, or soar<BR>
Upon his feathered courser in mid sky;<BR>
And oft were fain to find himself ashore:<BR>
For, if long time the spray so thickly fly,<BR>
He fears it so will bathe his hippogryph, <BR>
That he shall vainly covet gourd or skiff.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
He then new counsel took, and &#8217;twas the best,<BR>
With other arms the monster to pursue;<BR>
And lifting from his shield the covering vest,<BR>
To dazzle with the light his blasted view.<BR>
Landward towards the rock-chained maid he pressed,<BR>
And on her little finger, lest a new<BR>
Mischance should follow, slipt the ring, which brought<BR>
The enchantment of the magic shield to nought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
I say the ring, which Bradamant, to free<BR>
Rogero, from Brunello&#8217;s hand had rent,<BR>
And which, to snatch him from Alcina, she<BR>
Had next to India by Melissa sent.<BR>
Melissa (as before was said by me),<BR>
In aid of many used the instrument;<BR>
And to Rogero this again had born;<BR>
By whom &#8217;twas ever on his finger worn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
He gave it now Angelica; for he<BR>
Feared lest the buckler&#8217;s light should be impaired,<BR>
And willed as well those beauteous eyes should be<BR>
Defended, which had him already snared.<BR>
Pressing beneath his paunch full half the sea,<BR>
Now to the shore the monstrous whale repaired:<BR>
Firm stood Rogero, and the veil undone,<BR>
Appeared to give the sky another sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
He in the monster&#8217;s eyes the radiance throws,<BR>
Which works as it was wont in other time.<BR>
As trout or grayling to the bottom goes<BR>
In stream, which mountaineer disturbs with lime;<BR>
So the enchanted buckler overthrows<BR>
The orc, reversed among the foam and slime.<BR>
Rogero here and there the beast astound<BR>
Still beats, but cannot find the way to wound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
This while the lady begs him not to bray<BR>
Longer the monster&#8217;s rugged scale in vain.<BR>
&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake turn and loose me&#8221; (did she say,<BR>
Still weeping) &#8220;ere the orc awake again.<BR>
Bear me with thee, and drown me in mid-way.<BR>
Let me not this foul monster&#8217;s food remain.&#8221;<BR>
By her just plaint Rogero moved, forebore,<BR>
Untied the maid, and raised her from the shore.</TD></TR>

Upon the beach the courser plants his feet,<BR>
And goaded by the rowel, towers in air,<BR>
And gallops with Rogero in mid seat,<BR>
While on the croup behind him sate the fair;<BR>
Who of his banquet so the monster cheat;<BR>
For him too delicate and dainty fare.<BR>
Rogero turns and with thick kisses plies<BR>
The lady&#8217;s snowy breast and sparkling eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
He kept no more the way, as he before<BR>
Proposed, for compassing the whole of Spain:<BR>
But stopt his courser on the neighbouring shore<BR>
Where lesser Britain runs into the main.<BR>
Upon the bank there rose an oakwood hoar,<BR>
Where Philomel for ever seemed to plain;<BR>
I&#8217; the middle was a meadow with a fountain,<BR>
And, at each end, a solitary mountain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas here the wishful knight first checked the rein,<BR>
And dropping in the meadow, made his steed<BR>
Furl, yet not shut so close, his wings again,<BR>
As he had spread them wide for better speed.<BR>
Down lights Rogero, and forbears with pain<BR>
From other leap; but this his arms impede:<BR>
His arms impede; a bar to his desire,<BR>
And he must doff them would he slake the fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
Now here, now there, confused by different throng,<BR>
Rogero did his shining arms undo:<BR>
Never the task appeared to him so long;<BR>
For where he loosed one knot, he fastened two.<BR>
But, sir, too long continued is this song,<BR>
And haply may as well have wearied you;<BR>
So that I shall delay to other time,<BR>
When it may better please, my tedious rhyme.</TD></TR>
