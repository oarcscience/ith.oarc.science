<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Gryphon finds traitorous Origilla nigh<BR>
Damascus city, with Martano vile.<BR>
Slaughtered the Saracens and Christians lie<BR>
By thousands and by thousands heaped this while;<BR>
And if the Moor outside of Paris die,<BR>
Within the Sarzan so destroys each pile,<BR>
Such slaughter deals, that greater ill than this<BR>
Never before has been exprest, I wiss.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Love&#8217;s penalties are manifold and dread:<BR>
Of which I have endured the greater part,<BR>
And, to my cost, in these so well am read,<BR>
That I can speak of them as &#8217;twere my art.<BR>
Hence if I say, or if I ever said,<BR>
(Did speech or living page my thoughts impart)<BR>
&#8220;One ill is grievous and another light.&#8221;<BR>
Yield me belief, and deem my judgment right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
I say, I said, and, while I live, will say,<BR>
&#8220;He, who is fettered by a worthy chain,<BR>
Though his desire his lady should gainsay,<BR>
And, every way averse, his suit disdain;<BR>
Though Love deprive him of all praised pay,<BR>
After long time and trouble spent in vain,<BR>
He, if his heart be placed well worthily,<BR>
Needs not lament though he should waste and die.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Let him lament, who plays a slavish part,<BR>
Whom two bright eyes and lovely tresses please:<BR>
Beneath which beauties lurks a wanton heart<BR>
With little that is pure, and much of lees.<BR>
The wretch would fly; but bears in him a dart,<BR>
Like wounded stag, whichever way he flees;<BR>
Dares not confess, yet cannot quench, his flame,<BR>
And of himself and worthless love has shame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
The youthful Gryphon finds him in this case,<BR>
Who sees the error which he cannot right;<BR>
He sees how vilely he his heart does place<BR>
On faithless Origille, his vain delight:<BR>
Yet evil use doth sovereign reason chase,<BR>
And free will is subdued by appetite.<BR>
Though a foul mind the lady&#8217;s actions speak,<BR>
Her, wheresoe&#8217;er she is, must Gryphon seek.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Resuming the fair history, I say,<BR>
Out of the city he in secret rode;<BR>
Nor to his brother would his plan bewray,<BR>
Who oft on him had vain reproof bestowed:<BR>
But to the left t&#8217;wards Ramah shaped his way,<BR>
By the most level and most easy road.<BR>
Him six days&#8217; journey to Damascus brought,<BR>
Whence, setting out anew, he Antioch sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
He nigh Damascus met the lover, who<BR>
Perfidious Origilla&#8217;s heart possest,<BR>
And matched in evil customs were the two,<BR>
Like stalk and flower: for that in either&#8217;s breast<BR>
Was lodged a fickle heart; the dame untrue,<BR>
And he a traitor whom she loved the best.<BR>
While both the lovers hid their nature base,<BR>
To others&#8217; cost, beneath a courteous face.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
As I relate to you, the cavalier<BR>
Came on huge courser, trapped with mickle pride;<BR>
With faithless Origille, in gorgeous gear,<BR>
With gold embroidered, and with azure dyed.<BR>
Two ready knaves, who serve the warrior, rear<BR>
The knightly helm and buckler at his side;<BR>
As one who with fair pomp and semblance went<BR>
Towards Damascus, to a tournament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Damascus&#8217; king a splendid festival<BR>
Had in these days bid solemnly proclaim;<BR>
And with what pomp they could, upon his call,<BR>
Thither, in shining arms, the champions came.<BR>
At Gryphon&#8217;s sight the harlot&#8217;s spirits fall,<BR>
Who fears that he will work her scathe and shame;<BR>
And knows her lover has not force and breath<BR>
To save her from Sir Gryphon, threatening death;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
But like most cunning and audacious quean,<BR>
Although she quakes from head to foot with fear,<BR>
Her voice so strengthens, and so shapes her mien,<BR>
That in her face no signs of dread appear,<BR>
Having already made her leman ween<BR>
The trick devised, she feigns a joyous cheer,<BR>
Towards Sir Gryphon goes, and for long space<BR>
Hangs on his neck, fast-locked in her embrace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
She, after suiting with much suavity<BR>
The action to the word, sore weeping, cried:<BR>
&#8220;Dear lord, is this the guerdon due to me,<BR>
For love and worship? that I should abide<BR>
Alone one live long year, deprived of thee,<BR>
&#8212;A second near&#8212;and, yet upon thy side<BR>
No grief?&#8212;and had I borne for thee to stay,<BR>
I know not if I should have seen that day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When I from Nicosia thee expected<BR>
(When thou wast journeying to the plenar court)<BR>
To cheer me,&#8212;left with fever sore infected,<BR>
And in the dread of death,&#8212;I heard report<BR>
That thou wast gone to Syria; and dejected<BR>
By that ill tiding, suffered in such sort,<BR>
I, all unable to pursue thy quest,<BR>
Had nigh with this right hand transfixt my breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But fortune, by her double bounty, shows<BR>
She guards me more than thou: me to convey<BR>
She sent my brother here, who with me goes,<BR>
My honour safe in his protecting stay;<BR>
And this encounter with thee now bestows,<BR>
Which I above all other blessings weigh,<BR>
And in good time; for hadst thou longer stayed,<BR>
My lord, I should have died of hope delayed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
The wicked woman, full of subtlety<BR>
(Worse than a fox in crafty hardihood)<BR>
Pursues, and so well shapes her history,<BR>
She wholly throws the blame on Gryphon good;<BR>
Makes him believe that other not to be<BR>
Her kin alone, but of her flesh and blood,<BR>
Got by one father;&#8212;and so puts upon<BR>
The knight, that he less credits Luke and John.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Nor he the fraud of her, more false than fair,<BR>
Only forbore with just reproach to pay;<BR>
Nor only did the threatened stranger spare,<BR>
Who was the lover of that lady gay;<BR>
But deemed to excuse himself sufficient were,<BR>
Turning some portion of the blame away;<BR>
And as the real brother she profest,<BR>
Unceasingly the lady&#8217;s knight carest;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
And to Damascus, with the cavalier<BR>
Returned, who to Sir Gryphon made report,<BR>
That Syria&#8217;s wealthy king, with sumptuous cheer,<BR>
Within that place would hold a splendid court;<BR>
And who, baptized or infidel, appear<BR>
There at his tourney (of whatever sort),<BR>
Within the city and without, assures<BR>
From wrong, for all the time the feast endures.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Yet I of Origilla&#8217;s treachery<BR>
Shall not so steadfastly pursue the lore,<BR>
Who, famed not for one single perfidy,<BR>
Thousands and thousands had betrayed before,<BR>
But that I will return again to see<BR>
Two hundred thousand wretched men or more<BR>
Burnt by the raging wild-fire, where they spread,<BR>
About the walls of Paris, scathe and dread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
I left you where king Agramant prepared<BR>
To storm a gate, and to the assault was gone:<BR>
This he had hoped to find without a guard;<BR>
And work elsewhere to bar the way was none.<BR>
For there, in person, Charles kept watch and ward<BR>
With many, practised warriors every one;<BR>
Two Angelines, two Guidos, Angelier,<BR>
Avino, Avolio, Otho, and Berlinghier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
One and the other host its worth, before<BR>
Charles and king Agramant, desire to show,<BR>
Where praise, where riches are, they think, in store<BR>
For those that do their duty on the foe.<BR>
But such were not the atchievements of the Moor<BR>
As to repair the loss; for, to his woe,<BR>
Full many a Saracen the champaign prest;<BR>
Whose folly was a beacon to the rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
The frequent darts a storm of hail appear,<BR>
Which from the city-wall the Christians fling;<BR>
The deafening clamours put the heavens in fear,<BR>
Which, from our part, and from that other, ring.<BR>
But Charles and Agramant must wait; for here<BR>
I of the Mars of Africa will sing,<BR>
King Rodomont, that fierce and fearful man,<BR>
That through the middle of the city ran.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
I know not, sir, if you the adventure dread<BR>
Of that so daring Moor to mind recall,<BR>
The leader, who had left his people dead,<BR>
Between the second work and outer wall;<BR>
Upon those limbs the ravening fire so fed,<BR>
Was never sight more sad!&#8212;I told withal,<BR>
How vaulting o&#8217;er that hindrance at a bound,<BR>
He cleared the moat which girt the city round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
When he was known the thickening crowd among,<BR>
By the strange arms he wore and scaly hide,<BR>
There, where the aged sires and feebler throng.<BR>
Listened to each new tale on every side;<BR>
Heaven-high groan, moan, and lamentation rung,<BR>
And loud they beat their lifted palms and cried:<BR>
While those who had the strength to fly aloof,<BR>
Sought safety not from house or temple&#8217;s roof.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
But this the cruel sword concedes to few,<BR>
So brandished by that Saracen robust;<BR>
And here, with half a leg dissevered, flew<BR>
A foot, there head divided from the bust:<BR>
This cleft across, and that behold him hew,<BR>
From head to hips, so strong the blow and just.<BR>
While, of the thousands wounded by the Moor,<BR>
Is none that shows an honest scar before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
What by weak herd, in fields of Hircany,<BR>
The tiger does, or Indian Ganges near,<BR>
Or wolf, by lamb or kid, on heights which lie<BR>
On Typheus&#8217; back, the cruel cavalier<BR>
Now executes on those, I will not, I<BR>
Call phalanxes or squadrons, but a mere<BR>
Rabble, that I should term a race forlorn,<BR>
Who but deserved to die ere they were born.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Of all he cuts, and thrusts, and maims, and bleeds,<BR>
There is not one who looks him in the face.<BR>
Throughout that street, which in a straight line leads<BR>
Up to St. Michael&#8217;s bridge, so thronged a space,<BR>
Rodomont, terrible and fearful, speeds,<BR>
Whirling his bloody brand, nor grants he grace,<BR>
In his career, to servant or to lord;<BR>
And saint and sinner feel alike the sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Religion cannot for the priest bespeak<BR>
Mercy, nor innocence avail the child:<BR>
Nor gently beaming eyes, nor vermeil cheek,<BR>
Protect the blooming dame or damsel mild.<BR>
Age smites its breast and flies: while bent to wreak<BR>
Vengeance, the Saracen, with gore defiled,<BR>
Shows not his valour more than cruel rage,<BR>
Heedless alike of order, sex, and age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Nor the impious king alone with human blood,<BR>
&#8212;Lord of the impious he&#8212;his hand distains,<BR>
But even on walls so sorely vents his mood,<BR>
He fires fair houses, and polluted fanes.<BR>
The houses almost all were made of wood,<BR>
Then (as &#8217;tis told) and this, by what remains,<BR>
May be believed; for yet in Paris we<BR>
Six out of ten no better builded see.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Though flames demolish all things far and wide,<BR>
This ill appears his furious hate to slake:<BR>
Where&#8217;er the paynim has his hands applied,<BR>
He tumbles down a roof at every shake.<BR>
My lord, believe, you never yet espied<BR>
Bombard in Padua, of so large a make,<BR>
That it could rend from wall of battered town<BR>
What, at a single pull, the king plucked down.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
While the accursed man, amid the rout,<BR>
So warred with fire and sword, if at his post,<BR>
King Agramant had prest it from without,<BR>
The ample city had that day been lost.<BR>
But he was hindered by the warrior stout,<BR>
Who came from England with the advancing host,<BR>
Composed of English and of Scotch allied,<BR>
With Silence and the Angel for their guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
It was God&#8217;s will, that while through town and tower<BR>
The furious Rodomont such ruin spread,<BR>
Thither arrived Rinaldo, Clermont&#8217;s flower.<BR>
Three leagues above, he o&#8217;er the river&#8217;s bed<BR>
Had cast a bridge; from whence his English power<BR>
To the left-hand by crooked ways he led;<BR>
That, meaning to assail the barbarous foes,<BR>
The stream no obstacle might interpose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo had, with Edward, sent a force,<BR>
Six thousand strong, of archer infantry,<BR>
And sped, with Ariman, two thousand horse<BR>
Of lightest sort; and foot and cavalry<BR>
Sought Paris by those roads, which have their course<BR>
Directly to, and from, the Picard sea;<BR>
That by St. Martin&#8217;s and St. Denys&#8217; gate,<BR>
They might convey the aid the burghers wait.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo sent with these the baggage train<BR>
And carriages, with which his troops were stored;<BR>
And fetching, with the forces that remain,<BR>
A compass, he the upper way explored.<BR>
He bridge, and boat, and means to pass the Seine,<BR>
Had with him; for it here was ill to ford.<BR>
He past his army, broke the bridges down,<BR>
And rank&#8217;d in line the bands of either crown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
But having first the peers and captains wheeled<BR>
About him in a ring, the cavalier<BR>
Mounted the bank which overtopt the field,<BR>
So much, that all might plainly see and hear;<BR>
And cried, &#8220;My lords, you should thanksgiving yield,<BR>
With lifted hands, to God, who brought you here;<BR>
Through whom, o&#8217;er every nation, you may gain<BR>
Eternal glory, bought with little pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Two princes, by your means, will rescued be,<BR>
If you relieve those city gates from siege;<BR>
Him, your own king, whom you from slavery<BR>
And death to save, a subject&#8217;s vows oblige;<BR>
And a famed emperor, of more majesty<BR>
Than ever yet in court was served by liege,<BR>
And with them other kings, and dukes, and peers,<BR>
And lords of other lands, and cavaliers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So that one city saving, not alone<BR>
Will the Parisians bless your helping hand,<BR>
Who, sadder than for sorrows of their own,<BR>
Timid, afflicted, and disheartened stand;<BR>
And their unhappy wives and children moan,<BR>
Which share in the same peril, and the band<BR>
Or virgins, dedicate to heavenly spouse,<BR>
Lest this day frustrate see their holy vows;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;I say, this city saved from deadly wound,<BR>
Not only will Parisians hold you dear;<BR>
But habitants of all the countries round:<BR>
Nor speak I only of the nations near;<BR>
For city there is none on Christian ground.<BR>
But what has citizens beleaguered here;<BR>
So that to you, for vanquishing the foe,<BR>
More lands than France will obligation owe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If him the ancients with a crown endued,<BR>
Who saved one citizen by worthy deed,<BR>
For rescuing such a countless multitude,<BR>
What recompense shall be your worthy meed?<BR>
But if, from jealousy or sloth, so good<BR>
And holy, enterprise should ill succeed,<BR>
Believe me, only while these walls endure,<BR>
Is Italy or Almayn&#8217;s realm secure;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Or any other part, where men adore<BR>
Him, who for us upon the cross was hung;<BR>
Nor think that distance saves you from the Moor,<BR>
Nor deem your island strong, the waves among.<BR>
For if, from far Gibraltar&#8217;s straits of yore,<BR>
And old Alcides&#8217; pillars, sailed the throng,<BR>
To bear off plunder from your sea-girt strands,<BR>
What will they do when they possess our lands?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, if in this fair enterprise arrayed,<BR>
No gain, no glory served you as a guide,<BR>
A common debt enjoins you mutual aid,<BR>
Militant here upon one Church&#8217;s side.<BR>
Moreover, let not any be afraid,<BR>
Our broken foemen will the assault abide;<BR>
Who seem to me ill-taught in warlike art,<BR>
A feeble rabble without arms or heart.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Such reasons, and yet better for, that need<BR>
Might good Rinaldo in his speech infer;<BR>
And with quick phrase and voice, to valiant deed<BR>
The high-minded barons and bold army stir;<BR>
And this was but to goad a willing steed<BR>
(As the old proverb says) who lacks no spur.<BR>
He moved the squadrons, having closed his speech,<BR>
Softly, beneath their separate banners, each.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
He, without clamour, without any noise.<BR>
So moves his triple host, their flags below.<BR>
Zerbino, marching by the stream, enjoys<BR>
The honour first to assail the barbarous foe;<BR>
The paladin the Irishmen employs<BR>
More inland, with a wider wheel to go.<BR>
Thus England&#8217;s horse and foot, the two between,<BR>
Led by the Duke of Lancaster, are seen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
The paladin rode on, along the shore,<BR>
When he had put the warriors in their way,<BR>
And, passing by their squadrons, pricked before<BR>
Valiant Zerbino and his whole array,<BR>
Until he reached the quarters of the Moor,<BR>
Where Oran&#8217;s king, and king Sobrino lay;<BR>
Who, half-a-mile removed from those of Spain,<BR>
Posted upon that side, observed the plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
With such a faithful escort fortified<BR>
And sure, the Christians who had thither wound,<BR>
With Silence and the Angel for their guide,<BR>
No longer could stand mute or keep their ground:<BR>
But hearing now the foe, with shouts defied<BR>
Their host, and made the shrilling trumpets sound;<BR>
And with loud clamours, which Heaven&#8217;s concave fill,<BR>
Sent through the paynim&#8217;s bones a deadly chill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo spurs before the troops combined<BR>
His foaming courser, and his weapon rests;<BR>
And a full bow-shot leaves the Scots behind:<BR>
So all delay the impatient peer molests.<BR>
As oftentimes an eddying gust of winds<BR>
Issues, ere yet the horrid storm infests,<BR>
So sallying swiftly from the following herd,<BR>
Rinaldo forth upon Bayardo spurred.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
As the aspect of the paladin of France,<BR>
The wavering Moorish files betray their fear;<BR>
And, trembling in their hands, is seen the lance,<BR>
Their thighs and stirrups quivering, like the spear.<BR>
King Pulian only marks the knight&#8217;s advance,<BR>
Knowing Rinaldo not, unchanged in cheer;<BR>
Nor thinking such a cruel shock to meet,<BR>
Gallops against him on his courser fleet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
He stoops upon the weapon which he strains,<BR>
Whole and collected for the martial game:<BR>
Then to his horse abandoning the reins,<BR>
And goading with both spurs the courser, came.<BR>
Upon the other side no valour feigns,<BR>
But shows, by doings, what he is in name;<BR>
&#8212;With what rare grace and matchless art he wars,<BR>
The son of Aymon, rather son of Mars.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Well-matched in skill, they aimed their cruel blows,<BR>
With lances at each other&#8217;s heads addrest;<BR>
Ill matched, in arms and valour, were the foes,<BR>
For this past on, and that the champaigne prest.<BR>
More certain proof of worth, when warriors close,<BR>
There needs than knightly lance, well placed in rest;<BR>
But Fortune even more than Valour needs,<BR>
Which ill, without her saving succour, speeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
With the good spear new levelled in his fist,<BR>
At Oran&#8217;s king behold Rinaldo dart.<BR>
Of bulk, and bone, and sinew, to resist<BR>
The monarch was, but ill supplied with heart.<BR>
And his might pass for a fair stroke in list,<BR>
Though planted in the buckler&#8217;s nether part.<BR>
Let those excuse it who refuse to admire,<BR>
Since the good paladin could reach no higher.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Nor did the buckler so the weapon stay,<BR>
Though made of palm within, and steel without,<BR>
But that it pierced the paunch, and made a way<BR>
To let that mean and ill matched spirit out.<BR>
The courser, who had deemed that all the day<BR>
He must so huge a burden bear about,<BR>
Thanked in his heart the warrior, who well met,<BR>
Had thus preserved him from so sore a sweat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo, having broke his rested spear,<BR>
So wheels his horse, he seems equipt with wings;<BR>
Who, turning swiftly with the cavalier,<BR>
Amid the closest crowd, impetuous springs.<BR>
Composed of brittle glass the arms appear<BR>
Where Sir Rinaldo red Fusberta swings.<BR>
Nor tempered steel is there, nor corslet thick,<BR>
Which keeps the sword from biting to the quick.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Yet few the tempered plates or iron pins<BR>
With which encounters that descending brand;<BR>
But targets, some of oak and some of skins,<BR>
And quilted vest and turban&#8217;s twisted band.<BR>
Lightly such drapery good Rinaldo thins,<BR>
And cleaves, and bores, and shears, on either hand;<BR>
Nor better from his sword escapes the swarm,<BR>
Than grass from sweeping scythe, or grain from storm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
The foremost squadron had been put to flight,<BR>
When thither the vanguard Zerbino led.<BR>
Forth pricking from the following crowd, in sight<BR>
Appeared, with levelled lance, their youthful head:<BR>
With no less fury those who trooped to fight<BR>
Beneath his banner, to the combat sped;<BR>
Like lions, like so many wolves, who leap<BR>
In fury to the assault of goat or sheep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Both spurred their coursers on, with rested lance,<BR>
When either warrior to his foe was near;<BR>
And that short interval, that small expanse,<BR>
Of plain, between, was seen to disappear.<BR>
Was never witnessed yet a stranger dance!<BR>
For the Scots only ply the murderous spear;<BR>
Only the scattered paynims slaughtered lie,<BR>
As if conducted thither but to die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
It seemed as if each coward paynim grew<BR>
More cold than ice, each Scot more fierce than flame.<BR>
The Moors believed that with Rinaldo&#8217;s thew<BR>
And muscle fortified, each Christian came.<BR>
Sobrino quickly moved his ordered crew,<BR>
Nor stayed till herald should his call proclaim:<BR>
Better were they than those which went before,<BR>
For captain, armour, and for martial lore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Less worthless men of Africa were they,<BR>
Though ill had they been deemed of much avail.<BR>
Ill harnessed, and worse trained to martial fray,<BR>
Forthwith King Dardinel, the foe to assail,<BR>
Moved up his host, himself in helmet gay,<BR>
And sheathing all his limbs in plate and mail.<BR>
The fourth division I believe was best,<BR>
Which, under Isolier, to battle prest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Thraso, this while, the valiant Duke of Mar,<BR>
Glad in the tumult, for the cavaliers<BR>
Who muster in his train, uplifts the bar,<BR>
And to the lists of fame his following chears,<BR>
When Isolier, with horsemen of Navarre,<BR>
Entered in that fierce fray he sees and hears.<BR>
Next Ariodantes moved his chivalry,<BR>
Who was of late made Duke of Albany.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
The deep sonorous trumpet&#8217;s bellowing,<BR>
And sound of drum, and barbarous instrument,<BR>
Combined with twang of bow, and whiz of sling,<BR>
Wheel and machine, and stone from engine sent,<BR>
And (what more loud than these appeared to ring)<BR>
Tumult, and shriek, and groan, and loud lament,<BR>
Composed a direr whole than what offends<BR>
The neighbouring tribes where deafening Nile descends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
The arrows&#8217; double shower the ample sky<BR>
With wide-extended shade is seen to shrowd;<BR>
Breath, smoke of sweat and dust ascend on high,<BR>
And seem to stamp in air a murky cloud.<BR>
By turns each host gives way, and you might spy,<BR>
Now chasing, now in flight, the self-same crowd;<BR>
And here some wight, beside his foeman slain,<BR>
Or little distant, prostrate on the plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
When, harassed with fatigue, a wearied crew<BR>
Withdraw, fresh files their fellows reinforce:<BR>
Men, here and there, the wasted ranks renew;<BR>
Here march supplies of foot, and there of horse:<BR>
Her mantle green for robe of crimson hue<BR>
Earth shifts, ensanguined where the warriors course:<BR>
And there were azure flowers and yellow sprung,<BR>
Now slaughtered men lie stretched their steeds among.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
Zerbino was more wonders seen to do<BR>
Than ever stripling of his age, he strowed<BR>
The ground with heaps of dead, and overthrew<BR>
The paynim numbers which about him flowed.<BR>
The valiant Ariodantes to his new-<BR>
Entrusted squadron mighty prowess showed;<BR>
Filling with dread and wonder, near and far,<BR>
The squadrons of Castile and of Navarre.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Chelindo and Mosco (bastards were the twain<BR>
Of Calabrun, late king of Arragon),<BR>
And one esteemed among the valiant train,<BR>
Calamidor, of Barcellona&#8217;s town,<BR>
Leaving their standards, in the hope to gain,<BR>
By young Zerbino&#8217;s death, a glorious force,<BR>
And wounded in his flanks the prince&#8217;s horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Pierced by three lances lay the courser strong,<BR>
But bold Zerbino quickly rose anew;<BR>
And, eager to avenge his charger&#8217;s wrong,<BR>
The assailants, where he sees them, will pursue.<BR>
Zerbino at Mosco first, that overhung<BR>
Him, in the hope to make him prisoner, flew,<BR>
And pierced him in the flank; who from his sell,<BR>
Pallid and cold, upon the champaign fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
When him so killed, as &#8217;twere by stealthy blow,<BR>
Chelindo viewed, to avenge his brother slain,<BR>
He charged, intent the prince to overthrow;<BR>
But he seized fast his courser by the rein,<BR>
And, thence to rise not, laid the charger low,<BR>
Destined no more to feed on hay or grain;<BR>
For at one stroke, so matchless was his force,<BR>
Zerbino cleft the rider and his horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
When that fell blow Calamidor espied,<BR>
He turned the bridle short to speed away,<BR>
But him with downright cut Zerbino plied<BR>
Behind, and cried withal, &#8220;Stay, traitor, stay.&#8221;<BR>
Nor from its aim the sword-stroke wandered wide,<BR>
Though from the mark it went somedeal astray;<BR>
The falchion missed the rider as he fled,<BR>
But reached the horse&#8217;s croup, and stretched him dead,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
He quits the horse, and thence for safety crawls;<BR>
But he with little boot escapes his foe;<BR>
For him Duke Thraso&#8217;s horse o&#8217;erturns and mawls,<BR>
Opprest the ponderous courser&#8217;s weight below.<BR>
Where the huge crowd upon Zerbino falls,<BR>
Ariodantes and Lurcanio go;<BR>
And with them many a cavalier and count,<BR>
Who do their best Zerbino to remount.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Then Artalico and Margano knew<BR>
The force of Ariodantes&#8217; circling brand:<BR>
While Casimir and Enearco rue<BR>
More deeply yet the puissance of his hand.<BR>
Smote by the knight, escaped the former two;<BR>
The others were left dead upon the strand.<BR>
Lurcanio shows what are his force and breath;<BR>
Who charges, smites, o&#8217;erturns, and puts to death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Sir, think not that more inland on the plain<BR>
The warfare is less mortal than along<BR>
The stream, nor that the troops behind remain<BR>
Which to the duke of Lancaster belong.<BR>
He valiantly assailed the flags of Spain,<BR>
And long in even scale the battle hung.<BR>
For Horse and Foot, and Captains of those bands,<BR>
On either side, could deftly ply their hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Forward Sir Oldrad pricks and Fieramont;<BR>
This Glocester&#8217;s duke, and York&#8217;s the other knight;<BR>
With them conjoined is Richard, Warwick&#8217;s count,<BR>
And the bold duke of Clarence, Henry hight.<BR>
These Follicon and Matalista front,<BR>
And Baricond, with all they lead to fight.<BR>
Almeria this, and that Granada guides,<BR>
And o&#8217;er Marjorca Baricond presides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Well matched awhile the Christian and the Moor<BR>
Appeared, without advantage in the fray.<BR>
Not this, now that gave ground, like corn before<BR>
The light and fickle breeze which blows in May:<BR>
Or as the sea which ripples on the shore,<BR>
Still comes and goes, nor keeps one certain way,<BR>
When hollow Fortune thus had sported long,<BR>
She proved disastrous to the paynim throng.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
The duke of Glocester Matalista bold<BR>
Assailed this while, and hurtled from his sell;<BR>
Fieramont Follicon o&#8217;erturned and rolled,<BR>
In the right shoulder smit, on earth as well.<BR>
The advancing English either paynim hold,<BR>
And bear their prisoners off to dungeon cell.<BR>
This while, Sir Baricond is, in the strife,<BR>
By Clarence&#8217;s bold duke deprived of life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Hence &#8217;tis among the Moors amazement all,<BR>
While hence the Christians take such heart and pride,<BR>
The bands do nought but quit their ground and fall,<BR>
And break their order on the Paynim side,<BR>
What time the Christian troops come on, and gall<BR>
Their flying rants, which nowhere will abide:<BR>
And had not one arrived to aid their host.<BR>
The Paynim camp had on that side been lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
But Ferrau, who till this time ever nigh<BR>
Marsilius, scarce had quitted him that day,<BR>
When half destroyed he marked his chivalry,<BR>
And saw that baffled banner born away,<BR>
Pricked his good courser forth, in time to spy,<BR>
(Where mid those squadrons hottest waxed the fray)<BR>
With his head severed in a griesly wound,<BR>
Olympio de la Serra fall to ground:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
A stripling he, who such sweet musick vented,<BR>
Accorded to the horned lyre&#8217;s soft tone;<BR>
That at the dulcet melody relented<BR>
The hearer&#8217;s heart, though harder than a stone.<BR>
Happy! if, with such excellence contented,<BR>
He had pursued so fair a fame alone,<BR>
And loathed shield, quiver, helmet, sword and lance;<BR>
Destined by these to die a youth in France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
When bold French beheld his cruel plight,<BR>
For whom he love and much esteem profest,<BR>
He felt more pity at the doleful sight<BR>
Than, &#8217;mid those thousands slain, for all the rest.<BR>
And smote the foe who slew him with such might,<BR>
That he his helm divided from the crest;<BR>
Cut front, eyes, visage, and mid bosom through,<BR>
And cast him down amid the slaughtered crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Nor stops he here, nor leaves a corslet whole,<BR>
Nor helm unbroken, where his sword is plied,<BR>
Of this the front or cheek, of that the poll,<BR>
The arm of other foe his strokes divide;<BR>
And he, of these divorcing body and soul,<BR>
Restores the wavering battle on that side;<BR>
Whence the disheartened and ignoble throng<BR>
Are scattered wide, and broke, and driven along.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Into the medley pricks King Agramant,<BR>
Desirous there his bloody course to run;<BR>
With him King Baliverzo, Farurant,<BR>
Soridan, Bambirago, Prusion;<BR>
And next so many more of little vaunt,<BR>
Whose blood will form a lake ere day be done,<BR>
That I could count each leaf with greater ease<BR>
When autumn of their mantle strips the trees.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Agramant from the wall a numerous band<BR>
Of horse and foot withdraws, and sends the array<BR>
Beneath the king of Fez, with a command<BR>
Behind the Moorish tents to make his way,<BR>
And those of Ireland in their march withstand,<BR>
Whom he sees hurrying with what haste they may,<BR>
And with wide wheel and spacious compass wind,<BR>
To fall upon the paynim camp behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
The king of Fez upon this service prest;<BR>
For all delay might sore his work impede.<BR>
This while King Agramant unites the rest,<BR>
And parts the troops who to the battle speed.<BR>
He sought himself the river, where he guessed<BR>
The Moorish host might most his presence need;<BR>
And, from that quarter, had a courier prayed,<BR>
By King Sobrino sent, the monarch&#8217;s aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
He more than half his camp behind him led,<BR>
In one deep phalanx. At the mighty sound<BR>
Alone, the Scotsmen trembled, and in dread<BR>
Abandoned honour, order, and their ground:<BR>
Lurcanio, Ariodantes, and their head,<BR>
Zerbino, there alone the torrent bound;<BR>
And haply he, who was afoot, had died,<BR>
But that in time his need Rinaldo spied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Elsewhere the paladin was making fly<BR>
A hundred banners: while the cavalier<BR>
So chased the quailing Saracens, the cry<BR>
Of young Zerbino&#8217;s peril smote the ear;<BR>
For, single and afoot, his chivalry<BR>
Amid the Africans had left the peer.<BR>
Rinaldo turned about and took his way<BR>
Where he beheld the Scots in disarray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
He plants his courser, where their squadrons yield<BR>
To the fierce paynims, and exclaims: &#8220;Where go<BR>
Your bands, and why so basely quit the field,<BR>
Yielding so vilely to so vile a foe?<BR>
Behold the promised trophies, spear and shield,<BR>
Spoils which your loaded churches ought to show!<BR>
What praise! what glory! that alone, and reft<BR>
Of his good horse, your monarch&#8217;s son is left!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
He from a squire receives a lance, and spies<BR>
King Prusion little distant, sovereign<BR>
Of the Alvaracchiae, and against him hies;<BR>
Whom he unhorses, dead upon the plain.<BR>
So Agricalt, so Bambirago dies;<BR>
And next sore wounded is Sir Soridane;<BR>
Who had been slain as well amid the throng,<BR>
If good Rinaldo&#8217;s lance had proved more strong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
That weapon broken, he Fusberta rears,<BR>
And smites Sir Serpentine, him of the star.<BR>
Though charmed from mischief are the cavalier&#8217;s<BR>
Good arms, he falls astounded by the jar,<BR>
And thus Rinaldo round Zerbino clears<BR>
The field so widely, where those champions war,<BR>
That without more dispute he takes a horse<BR>
Of those, who masterless, at random, course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
That he in time remounted it was well,<BR>
Who haply would not, if he more delayed:<BR>
For Agramant at once, and Dardinel,<BR>
Sobrino, and Balastro thither made;<BR>
But he, who had in time regained the sell,<BR>
Wheeled, here and there his horse, with brandished blade,<BR>
Dispatching into hell the mixt array,<BR>
That how men live above their ghosts might say.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
The good Rinaldo, who to overthrow<BR>
The strongest of the foeman covets still,<BR>
At Agramant directs a deadly blow,<BR>
&#8212;Who seems too passing-proud, and greater ill<BR>
Works there, than thousand others of the foe&#8212;<BR>
And spurs his horse, the Moorish chief to spill.<BR>
He smote the monarch, broadside charged the steed,<BR>
And man and horse reversed upon the mead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
What time, without, in such destructive frays<BR>
Hate, Rage, and Fury, all offend by turns,<BR>
In Paris Rodomont the people slays,<BR>
And costly house, and holy temple burns:<BR>
While Charles elsewhere anther duty stays,<BR>
Who nothing hears of this, nor aught discerns.<BR>
He, in the town, receives the British band,<BR>
Which Edward and Sir Ariman command.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
To him a squire approached, who pale with dread,<BR>
Scarce drew his breath, and cried: &#8220;Oh, well away!<BR>
Alas! alas!&#8221; (and thus he often said,<BR>
Ere he could utter aught beside) &#8220;To-day,<BR>
To-day, sire, is the Roman empire sped,<BR>
And Christ to the heathen makes his flock a prey.<BR>
A fiend from air to-day has dropt, that none<BR>
Henceforth may in this city make their won.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Satan (in sooth, it can no other be)<BR>
Destroys and ruins the unhappy town.<BR>
Turn, and the curling wreaths of vapour see,<BR>
From the red flames which wander up and down;<BR>
List to those groans, and be they warrantry<BR>
Of the sad news thy servant now makes known!<BR>
One the fair city wastes with sword and fire,<BR>
Before whose vengeful fury all retire.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Even such as he, who hears the tumult wide,<BR>
And clatter of church-bells, ere he espy<BR>
The raging fire, concealed from none beside<BR>
Himself, to him most dangerous, and most nigh;<BR>
Such was King Charles; who heard, and then descried<BR>
The new disaster with his very eye.<BR>
Hence he the choicest of his meiny steers<BR>
Thither, where he the cry and tumult hears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
With many peers and chiefs, who worthiest are,<BR>
Summoned about him, Charlemagne is gone:<BR>
He bids direct his standards to the square<BR>
Whither the paynim had repaired; hears groan<BR>
And tumult, spies the horrid tokens there<BR>
Of cruelty, sees human members strown.<BR>
&#8212;No more&#8212;Let him return another time,<BR>
Who willingly will listen to this rhyme.</TD></TR>
