<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Odorico&#8217;s and Gabrina&#8217;s guilt repaid,<BR>
Youthful Zerbino sets at large the train;<BR>
He in defence of good Orlando&#8217;s blade,<BR>
Is afterwards by Mandricardo slain.<BR>
Isabel weeps; by Rodomont is made<BR>
War on the Tartar king, and truce again,<BR>
To succour Agramant and his array;<BR>
Who to the lilies are well-nigh a prey.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Let him make haste his feet to disengage,<BR>
Nor lime his wings, whom Love has made a prize;<BR>
For love, in fine, is nought but phrensied rage,<BR>
By universal suffrage of the wise:<BR>
And albeit some may show themselves more sage<BR>
Than Roland, they but sin in other guise.<BR>
For, what proves folly more than on this shelf,<BR>
Thus, for another, to destroy oneself?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Various are love&#8217;s effects; but from one source<BR>
All issue, though they lead a different way.<BR>
He is, as &#8217;twere, a forest, where parforce<BR>
Who enter its recess go astray;<BR>
And here and there pursue their devious course:<BR>
In sum, to you I, for conclusion, say;<BR>
He who grows old in love, besides all pain<BR>
Which waits such passion, well deserves a chain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
One here may well reproach me: &#8220;Brother, thou<BR>
Seest not thy faults, while thou dost others fit.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;I answer that I see mine plain enow,<BR>
In this my lucid interval of wit;<BR>
And strive and hope withal I shall forego<BR>
This dance of folly; but yet cannot quit,<BR>
As quickly as I would, the faults I own;<BR>
For my disease has reached the very bone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
I in the other canto said before,<BR>
Orlando, furious and insensate wight,<BR>
Having torn off the arms and vest he wore,<BR>
And cast away from him his faulchion bright,<BR>
And up-torn trees, and made the forest hoar<BR>
And hollow cave resound, and rocky height,<BR>
Towards the noise some shepherds, on that side,<BR>
Their heavy sins or evil planets guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Viewing the madman&#8217;s wonderous feats more near,<BR>
The frighted band of rustics turned and fled;<BR>
But they, in their disorder, knew not where,<BR>
As happens oftentimes in sudden dread.<BR>
The madman in a thought is in their rear,<BR>
Seizes a shepherd, and plucks off his head;<BR>
And this as easily as one might take<BR>
Apple from tree, or blossom from the brake.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
He by one leg the heavy trunk in air<BR>
Upheaved, and made a mace the rest to bray.<BR>
Astounded, upon earth he stretched one pair,<BR>
Who haply may awake at the last day.<BR>
The rest, who well awake at the last day.<BR>
The rest, who well advised and nimble are,<BR>
At once desert the field and scour away:<BR>
Nor had the madman their pursuit deferred,<BR>
Had he not turned already on their herd.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
By such examples warned, the rustic crew<BR>
Abandoned in the fields pick, scythe, and plough,<BR>
And to the roof of house and temple flew,<BR>
(For ill secure was elm or willow&#8217;s bough,)<BR>
From hence the maniac&#8217;s horrid rage they view;<BR>
Who, dealing kick, and bite, and scratch, and blow,<BR>
Horses and oxen slew, his helpless prey;<BR>
And well the courser ran who &#8217;scaped that day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Already might&#8217;st thou hear how loudly ring<BR>
The hubbub and the din, from neighbouring farms,<BR>
Outcry and horn, and rustic trumpeting;<BR>
And faster sound of bells; with various arms<BR>
By thousands, with spontoon, bow, spit, and sling.<BR>
Lo! from the hills the rough militia swarms.<BR>
As many peasants from the vale below,<BR>
To make rude war upon the madman go,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
As beats the wave upon the salt-sea shore,<BR>
Sportive at first, which southern wind has stirred,<BR>
When the next, bigger than what went before,<BR>
And bigger than the second, breaks the third;<BR>
And the vext water waxes evermore,<BR>
And louder on the beach the surf is heard:<BR>
The crowd, increasing so, the count assail,<BR>
And drop from mountain and ascend from dale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Twice he ten peasants slaughtered in his mood,<BR>
Who, charging him in disarray, were slain;<BR>
And this experiment right clearly showed<BR>
To stand aloof was safest for the train.<BR>
Was none who from his body could draw blood;<BR>
For iron smote the impassive skin in vain.<BR>
So had heaven&#8217;s King preserved the count from scathe,<BR>
To make him guardian of his holy faith.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
He would have been in peril on that day,<BR>
Had he been made of vulnerable mould;<BR>
And might have learned was &#8217;twas to cast away<BR>
His sword, and, weaponless, so play the bold.<BR>
The rustic troop retreated from the fray,<BR>
Seeing no stroke upon the madman told.<BR>
Since him no other enemy attends,<BR>
Orlando to a neighbouring township wends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Since every one had left the place for dread,<BR>
No wight he found within it, small or great:<BR>
But here was homely food in plenty spread,<BR>
Victual, well sorting with the pastoral state.<BR>
Here, acorns undistinguishing from bread,<BR>
By tedious fast and fury driven to sate<BR>
His hunger, he employed his hand and jaw<BR>
On what he first discovered, cooked or raw.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Thence, repossest with the desire to rove,<BR>
He, through the land, did man and beast pursue;<BR>
And scowering, in his phrensy, wood and grove,<BR>
Took sometimes goat or doe of dappled hue:<BR>
Often with bear and with wild boar he strove,<BR>
And with his naked hand the brutes o&#8217;erthrew;<BR>
And gorging oftentimes the savage fare,<BR>
Swallowed the prey with all its skin and hair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Now right, now left, he wandered, far and wide,<BR>
Throughout all France, and reached a bridge one day;<BR>
Beneath which ran an ample water&#8217;s tide,<BR>
Of steep and broken banks: a turret gray<BR>
Was builded by the spacious river&#8217;s side,<BR>
Discerned, from far and near, and every way.<BR>
What here he did I shall relate elsewhere,<BR>
Who first must make the Scottish prince my care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
When Roland had departed on his quest,<BR>
Zerbino paused some deal; then, in his rear,<BR>
Slowly his steed by the same path addrest,<BR>
Which had been taken by Anglantes&#8217; peer;<BR>
Nor two miles on his way, I think, had prest,<BR>
When he beheld a captive cavalier,<BR>
Upon a sorry, little, hackney tied,<BR>
And by armed horseman watched on either side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Zerbino speedily the prisoner knew,<BR>
And Isabel, as soon, when nigh surveyed.<BR>
This was Sir Odoric, the Biscayan, who,<BR>
Like wolf, the guardian of a lamb was made:<BR>
To whom, of all his friends esteemed most true,<BR>
Zerbino Isabella had conveyed;<BR>
Hoping, one hitherto by him found just,<BR>
Would now, as ever, have approved his trust.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Even then how all had chanced, with punctual lore,<BR>
Was Isabel relating to the knight;<BR>
How in the pinnace she was saved, before<BR>
The broken vessel sank at sea outright;<BR>
Odoric&#8217;s assault; and next, how bandits bore<BR>
Her to the cavern, in a mountain dight.<BR>
Nor Isabella yet her tale has told,<BR>
When bound the malefactor they behold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The two that had Sir Odoric in their ward,<BR>
The royal damsel Isabella knew;<BR>
And deemed he was her lover and her lord,<BR>
That pricked beside the lady, fair of hue.<BR>
More; that the bearings on his shield record<BR>
The honours of the stem from which he grew;<BR>
And found, as better they observed his cheer,<BR>
They had judged rightly of the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Lighting, with open arms and hurried pace,<BR>
They make towards Zerbino eagerly,<BR>
And, kneeling, with bare head, the prince embrace,<BR>
Where lord is clipt by one of less degree.<BR>
Zerbino, looking either in the face,<BR>
Knows one Corebo of Biscay to be,<BR>
And Sir Almonio, his co-mate; the pair<BR>
Charged, under Odoric, with the galley&#8217;s care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Almonio cried, &#8220;Since God is pleased in the end,<BR>
Grammercy! Isabel should be with you;<BR>
My lord, I very clearly comprehend<BR>
I should deliver tidings, nothing new,<BR>
If I should now inform you why I wend<BR>
With this offender, whom with me you view.<BR>
Since she, who at his hands has suffered worst,<BR>
The story of his crimes will have rehearsed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;How me that traitour duped thou hast not to learn,<BR>
What time he rid himself of me, nor how<BR>
Corebo, who would have avenged the scorn,<BR>
Intended to the damsel, was laid low;<BR>
But that which followed, upon my return,<BR>
By her unseen or heard, she cannot know,<BR>
So as to thee the story to have told;<BR>
The sequel of it then will I unfold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I seaward from the city, with a store<BR>
Of nags, collected in a hurry, fare;<BR>
Aye watchful, if the trace I can explore<BR>
Of those left far behind me; I repair<BR>
Thitherward; I arrive upon the shore,<BR>
The place where they were left; look everywhere;<BR>
Nor sign of them perceive upon that strand,<BR>
Except some steps, new-printed on the sand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The steps I traced into the forest drear;<BR>
Nor far within the greenwood had I wound,<BR>
When guided by a noise which smote my ear,<BR>
I saw my comrade bleeding on the ground:<BR>
Of Isabel I asked the cavalier,<BR>
Of Odoric, and what hand had dealt his wound;<BR>
And thence departed, when the thing I knew,<BR>
Seeking the wretch these precipices through.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Wide circling still I go, and through that day<BR>
I find no other sign of him that fled;<BR>
At length return to where Corebo lay,<BR>
Who had the ground about him dyed so red,<BR>
That he, had I made little more delay,<BR>
A grave would have required, and, more than bed<BR>
And succour of the leech, to make him sound,<BR>
Craved priest and friar to lay him in the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I had him to the neighbouring city brought,<BR>
And boarded with a friendly host; and there<BR>
Corebo&#8217;s cure in little time was wrought,<BR>
Beneath an old chirurgeon&#8217;s skilful care.<BR>
This finished, having arms and horses brought,<BR>
We thence together to the court repair<BR>
Of King Alphonso of Biscay; where I<BR>
Find out the traitor, and to fight defy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The monarch&#8217;s justice, who fair field and free<BR>
Allowed us for the duel, and my right,<BR>
And Destiny to boot (for Destiny<BR>
Oftener makes conquest where she listeth, light)<BR>
So backed my arms, that felon was by me<BR>
Worsted, and made a prisoner in the fight.<BR>
Alphonso, having heard his guilt confessed,<BR>
Bade me dispose of him as liked me best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Him would I neither loose, nor yet have slain,<BR>
But, as thou seest, in bonds to thee convey:<BR>
That whether he should be condemned to pain,<BR>
Or death, it should be thine his doom to say.<BR>
I, hearing thou wert with King Charlemagne,<BR>
Thither, in hope to find thee, took my way.<BR>
I thank my God, that thee upon this ground,<BR>
Where I least hoped to meet thee, I have found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As well I render thanks, that Isabel<BR>
I see restored to thee, I know not how,<BR>
Of whom, by reason of that traitor fell,<BR>
I deemed thou never more should&#8217;st tidings know.&#8221;<BR>
In silence prince Zerbino hears him tell<BR>
His story, gazing upon Odoric&#8217;s brow,<BR>
In pity, more than hate, as he perpends<BR>
How foully such a goodly friendship ends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
After Almonio had his tale suspended,<BR>
Astounded for a while the prince stood by;<BR>
Wondering, that he who least should have offended,<BR>
Had him requited with such treachery:<BR>
But, his long fit of admiration ended,<BR>
Waking from his amazement with a sigh,<BR>
Questioned the prisoner in the horsemen&#8217;s hold,<BR>
It that was true the cavalier had told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
The faithless man alighted, and down fell<BR>
Upon his bended knees, and answered: &#8220;Sir,<BR>
All people that on middle earth do dwell,<BR>
Through weakness of their nature, sin and err.<BR>
One thing alone distinguishes the well<BR>
And evil doer; this, at every stir<BR>
Of least desire, submits, without a blow;<BR>
That arms, but yields as well to stronger foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Had I been charged some castle to maintain,<BR>
And, without contest, on the first assault,<BR>
Hoisted the banners of the hostile train,<BR>
&#8212;For cowardice, or treason, fouler fault&#8212;<BR>
Upon my eyes (a well deserved pain)<BR>
Thou might&#8217;st have justly closed the darksome vault;<BR>
But, yielding to superior force, I read<BR>
I should not merit blame, but praise and meed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The stronger is the enemy, the more<BR>
Easily is the vanquished side excused:<BR>
I could but faith maintain as, girded sore,<BR>
The leaguered fort to keep her faith is used;<BR>
Even so, with all the sense, with all the lore<BR>
By sovereign wisdom into me infused,<BR>
This I essayed to keep; but in the end,<BR>
To o&#8217;ermastering assault was forced to bend.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
So said Sir Odoric; and after showed<BR>
(Though &#8217;twere too tedious to recount his suit)<BR>
Him no light cause had stirred, but puissant goad.<BR>
&#8212;If ever earnestness of prayer could boot<BR>
To melt a heart that with resentment glowed,<BR>
&#8212;If e&#8217;er humility produced good fruit,<BR>
It well might here avail; since all that best<BR>
Moves a hard heart, Sir Odoric now exprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Whether or no to venge such infamy,<BR>
Youthful Zerbino doubted: the review<BR>
Of faithless Odorico&#8217;s treachery<BR>
Moved him to death the felon to pursue;<BR>
The recollection of the amity<BR>
So long maintained between them, with the dew<BR>
Of pity cooled the fury in his mind,<BR>
And him to mercy towards the wretch inclined.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
While Scotland&#8217;s prince is doubting in such wise<BR>
To keep him captive, or to loose his chain;<BR>
Or to remove him from before his eyes,<BR>
By dooming him to die, or live in pain;<BR>
Loud neighing, thitherward the palfrey hies<BR>
From which the Tartar king had stript the rein;<BR>
And the old harridan, who had before<BR>
Nigh caused Zerbino&#8217;s death, among them bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
The horse, that had the others of that band<BR>
Heard at a distance, thither her conveyed.<BR>
Sore weeping came the old woman, and demand<BR>
For succour, in her trouble, vainly made.<BR>
Zerbino, when he saw her, raised his hand<BR>
To heaven, that had to him such grace displayed,<BR>
Giving him to decide that couple&#8217;s fate;<BR>
The only two that had deserved his hate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
The wicked hag is kept, so bids the peer,<BR>
Until he is determined what to do:<BR>
He to cut off her nose and either ear<BR>
Now thought, and her as an example shew.<BR>
Next, &#8217;twere far better, deemed the cavalier,<BR>
If to the vultures he her carcase threw:<BR>
He diverse punishments awhile revolved,<BR>
And thus the warrior finally resolved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
He to his comrades turned him round, and said:<BR>
&#8220;To let the traitour live I am content,<BR>
Who, if full grace he has not merited,<BR>
Yet merits not to be so foully shent.<BR>
I, as I find his fault of Love was bred,<BR>
To give him life and liberty consent;<BR>
And easily we all excuses own,<BR>
When on commanding Love the blame is thrown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Often has Love turned upside down a brain<BR>
Of sounder wit than that to him assigned,<BR>
And led to mischief of far deeper stain,<BR>
Than has so outraged us. Let Odoric find<BR>
Pardon his offences; I the pain<BR>
Of these should justly suffer, who was blind;<BR>
Blind when I gave him such a trust, nor saw<BR>
How easily the fire consumes the straw.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then gazing upon Odoric, &#8217;gan say:<BR>
&#8220;This is the penance I enjoin to thee;<BR>
That thou a year shalt with the beldam stay,<BR>
Nor ever leave this while her company;<BR>
But, roving or at rest, by night or day,<BR>
Shalt never for an hour without her be;<BR>
And her shall even unto death maintain<BR>
Against whoever threatens her with pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I will, if so this woman shall command,<BR>
With whosoe&#8217;er he be, thou battle do.<BR>
I will this while that thou all France&#8217;s land,<BR>
From city shalt to city, wander through.&#8221;<BR>
So says he: for as Odoric at his hand<BR>
Well merits death, for his foul trespass due,<BR>
This is a pitfall for his feet to shape,<BR>
Which it will be rare fortune if he &#8217;scape.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
So many women, many men betrayed,<BR>
And wronged by her, have been so many more,<BR>
Not without strife by knight shall he be stayed,<BR>
Who was beneath his care the beldam hoar.<BR>
So, for their crimes, shall both alike be paid;<BR>
She for her evil actions done before,<BR>
And he who wrongfully shall her defraud;<BR>
Nor far can go before he finds an end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
To keep the pact Zerbino makes him swear<BR>
A mighty oath, under this penalty,<BR>
That should he break his faith, and anywhere<BR>
Into his presence led by fortune be,<BR>
Without more mercy, without time for prayer,<BR>
A cruel death shall wait him, as his fee.<BR>
Next by his comrades (so their lord commands)<BR>
Sir Odoric is unpinioned from his bands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Corebo frees the traitor in the end,<BR>
Almonio yielding, yet as ill content:<BR>
For much Zerbino&#8217;s mercies both offend,<BR>
Which thus their so desired revenge prevent.<BR>
Thence, he disloyal to his prince and friend,<BR>
In company with that curst woman went.<BR>
What these befel Sir Turpin has not said,<BR>
But more I once in other author read.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
This author vouches (I declare not who)<BR>
That hence they had not one day&#8217;s journey wended,<BR>
When Odoric, to all pact, all faith, untrue,<BR>
For riddance of the pest to him commended,<BR>
About Gabrina&#8217;s neck a halter threw,<BR>
And left her to a neighbouring elm suspended;<BR>
And in a year (the place he does not name)<BR>
Almonio by the traitor did the same.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Zerbino, who the Paladin pursues,<BR>
And loath would be to lose the cavalier,<BR>
To his Scottish squadron of himself sends news,<BR>
Which for its captain well might stand in fear;<BR>
Almonio sends, and many matters shews,<BR>
Too long at full to be recited here;<BR>
Almonio sends, Corebo next; nor stayed<BR>
Other with him, besides the royal maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
So mighty is the love Zerbino bore,<BR>
Nor less than his the love which Isabel<BR>
Nursed for the valorous Paladin, so sore<BR>
He longed to know if that bold infidel<BR>
The Count had found, who in the duel tore<BR>
Him from his horse, together with the sell,<BR>
That he to Charles&#8217;s camp, till the third day<BR>
Be ended, will not measure back his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
This was the term for which Orlando said<BR>
He should wait him, who yet no faulchion wears;<BR>
Nor is there place the Count has visited,<BR>
But thither in his search Zerbino fares.<BR>
Last to those trees, upon whose bark was read<BR>
The ungrateful lady&#8217;s writing, he repairs,<BR>
Little beside the road; and there finds all<BR>
In strange disorder, rock and water-fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Far off, he saw that something shining lay,<BR>
And spied Orlando&#8217;s corslet on the ground;<BR>
And next his helm; but not that head-piece gay<BR>
Which whilom African Almontes crowned:<BR>
He in the thicket heard a courser neigh,<BR>
And, lifting up his visage at the sound,<BR>
Saw Brigliadoro the green herbage browze,<BR>
With rein yet hanging at his saddle-bows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
For Durindane, he sought the greenwood, round,<BR>
Which separate from the scabbard met his view;<BR>
And next the surcoat, but in tatters, found;<BR>
That, in a hundred rags, the champaign strew.<BR>
Zerbino and Isabel, in grief profound,<BR>
Stood looking on, nor what to think they knew:<BR>
They of all matters else might think, besides<BR>
The fury which the wretched Count misguides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Had but the lovers seen a drop of blood,<BR>
They might have well believed Orlando dead:<BR>
This while the pair, beside the neighbouring flood,<BR>
Beheld a shepherd coming, pale with dread.<BR>
He just before, as on a rock he stood,<BR>
Had seen the wretch&#8217;s fury; how he shed<BR>
His arms about the forest, tore his clothes,<BR>
Slew hinds, and caused a thousand other woes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Questioned by good Zerbino, him the swain<BR>
Of all which there had chanced, informed aright.<BR>
Zerbino marvelled, and believed with pain,<BR>
Although the proofs were clear: This as it might,<BR>
He from his horse dismounted on the plain,<BR>
Full of compassion, in afflicted plight;<BR>
And went about, collecting from the ground<BR>
The various relics which were scattered round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Isabel lights as well; and, where they lie<BR>
Dispersed, the various arms uniting goes.<BR>
Lo! them a damsel joins, who frequent sigh<BR>
Heaves from her heart, and doleful visage shows.<BR>
If any ask me who the dame, and why<BR>
She mourns, and with such sorrow overflows;<BR>
I say &#8217;twas Flordelice, who, bound in trace<BR>
Of her lost lover&#8217;s footsteps, sought that place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Her Brandimart had left disconsolate<BR>
Without farewell, i&#8217; the court of Charlemagne:<BR>
Who there expected him six months or eight;&#8212;<BR>
And lastly, since he came not there again,<BR>
From sea to sea, had sought her absent mate,<BR>
Through Alpine and through Pyrenean chain:<BR>
In every place had sought the warrior, save<BR>
Within the palace of Atlantes&#8217; grave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
If she had been in that enchanted hold,<BR>
She might before have seen the cavalier<BR>
Wandering with Bradamant, Rogero bold,<BR>
Gradasso and Ferrau and Brava&#8217;s peer.<BR>
But, when Astolpho chased the wizard old,<BR>
With the loud bugle, horrible to hear,<BR>
To Paris he returned; but nought of this<BR>
As yet was known to faithful Flordelice.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
To Flordelice were known the arms and sword<BR>
(Who, as I say, by chance so joined the twain),<BR>
And Brigliadoro, left without his lord,<BR>
Yet bearing at the saddle-bow his rein:<BR>
She with her eyes the unhappy signs explored,<BR>
And she had heard the tidings of the swain,<BR>
Who had alike related, how he viewed<BR>
Orlando running frantic, in his mood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Here prince Zerbino all the arms unites,<BR>
And hangs, like a fair trophy, on a pine.<BR>
And, to preserve them safe from errant knights,<BR>
Natives or foreigners, in one short line<BR>
Upon the sapling&#8217;s verdant surface writes,<BR>
ORLANDO&#8217;S ARMS, KING CHARLES&#8217;S PALADINE.<BR>
As he would say, &#8216;Let none this harness move,<BR>
Who cannot with its lord his prowess prove!&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Zerbino having done the pious deed,<BR>
Is bowning him to climb his horse; when, lo!<BR>
The Tartar king arrives upon the mead.<BR>
He, at the trophied pine-tree&#8217;s gorgeous show,<BR>
Beseeches him the cause of this to read;<BR>
Who lets him (as rehearsed) the story know.<BR>
When, without further pause, the paynim lord<BR>
Hastes gladly to the pine, and takes the sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;None can (he said) the action reprehend,<BR>
Nor first I make the faulchion mine today;<BR>
And to its just possession I pretend<BR>
Where&#8217;er I find it, be it where it may.<BR>
Orlando, this not daring to defend,<BR>
Has feigned him mad, and cast the sword away;<BR>
But if the champion so excuse his shame,<BR>
This is no cause I should forego my claim.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Take it not thence,&#8221; to him Zerbino cried,<BR>
&#8220;Nor think to make it thine without a fight:<BR>
If so thou tookest Hector&#8217;s arms of pride,<BR>
By theft thou hadst them, rather than by right.&#8221;<BR>
Without more parley spurred upon each side.<BR>
Well matched in soul and valour, either knight.<BR>
Already echoed are a thousand blows;<BR>
Nor yet well entered are the encountering foes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
In scaping Durindane, a flame in show<BR>
(He shifts so quickly) is the Scottish lord.<BR>
He leaps about his courser like a doe,<BR>
Where&#8217;er the road best footing does afford.<BR>
And well it is that he should not forego<BR>
An inch of vantage; who, if once that sword<BR>
Smite him, will join the enamoured ghosts, which rove<BR>
Amid the mazes of the myrtle grove.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
As the swift-footed dog, who does espy<BR>
Swine severed from his fellows, hunts him hard,<BR>
And circles round about; but he lies by<BR>
Till once the restless foe neglect his guard;<BR>
So, while the sword descends, or hangs on high,<BR>
Zerbino stands, attentive how to ward,<BR>
How to save life and honour from surprise;<BR>
And keeps a wary eye, and smites and flies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
On the other side, where&#8217;er the foe is seen<BR>
To threaten stroke in vain, or make good,<BR>
He seems an Alpine wind, two hills between,<BR>
That in the month of March shakes leafy wood;<BR>
Which to the ground now bends the forest green.<BR>
Now whirls the broken boughs, at random strewed.<BR>
Although the prince wards many, in the end<BR>
One mighty stroke he cannot scape or fend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
In the end he cannot scape one downright blow,<BR>
Which enters, between sword and shield, his breast,<BR>
As perfect was the plate and corslet, so<BR>
Thick was the steel wherein his paunch was drest:<BR>
But the destructive weapon, falling low,<BR>
Equally opened either iron vest;<BR>
And cleft whate&#8217;er it swept in its descent,<BR>
And to the saddle-bow, through cuirass, went.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
And, but that somewhat short the blow descends,<BR>
It would Zerbino like a cane divide;<BR>
But him so little in the quick offends,<BR>
This scarce beyond the skin is scarified.<BR>
More than a span in length the wound extends;<BR>
Of little depth: of blood a tepid tide<BR>
To his feet descending, with a crimson line,<BR>
Stains the bright arms which on the warrior shine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis so, I sometimes have been wont to view<BR>
A hand, more white than alabaster, part<BR>
The silver cloth, with ribbon red of hue;<BR>
A hand I often feel divide my heart.<BR>
Here little vantage young Zerbino drew<BR>
From strength and greater daring, and from art;<BR>
For in the temper of his arms and might,<BR>
Too much the Tartar king excelled the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
The fearful stroke was mightier in show,<BR>
Than in effect, by which the Prince was prest;<BR>
So that poor Isabel, distraught with woe,<BR>
Felt her heart severed in her frozen breast.<BR>
The Scottish prince, all over in a glow,<BR>
With anger and resentment was possest,<BR>
And putting all his strength in either hand,<BR>
Smote full the Tartar&#8217;s helmet with his brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Almost on his steed&#8217;s neck the Tartar fell,<BR>
Bent by the weighty blow Zerbino sped;<BR>
And, had the helmet been unfenced by spell,<BR>
The biting faulchion would have cleft his head.<BR>
The king, without delay, avenged him well,<BR>
&#8220;Nor I for you till other season,&#8221; said,<BR>
&#8220;Will keep this gift&#8221;; and levelled at his crest,<BR>
Hoping to part Zerbino to the chest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Zerbino, on the watch, whose eager eye<BR>
Waits on his wit, wheels quickly to the right;<BR>
But not withal so quickly, as to fly<BR>
The trenchant sword, which smote the shield outright,<BR>
And cleft from top to bottom equally;<BR>
Shearing the sleeve beneath it, and the knight<BR>
Smote on his arm; and next the harness rended,<BR>
And even to the champion&#8217;s thigh descended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Zerbino, here and there, seeks every way<BR>
By which to wound, nor yet his end obtains;<BR>
For, while he smites upon that armour gay,<BR>
Not even a feeble dint the coat retains.<BR>
On the other hand, the Tartar in the fray<BR>
Such vantage o&#8217;er the Scottish prince obtains,<BR>
Him he has wounded in seven parts or eight,<BR>
And reft his shield and half his helmet&#8217;s plate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
He ever wastes his blood; his energies<BR>
Fail, though he feels it not, as &#8217;t would appear;<BR>
Unharmed, the vigorous heart new force supplies<BR>
To the weak body of the cavalier.<BR>
His lady, during this, whose crimson dyes<BR>
Where chased by dread, to Doralice drew near,<BR>
And for the love of Heaven, the damsel wooed<BR>
To stop that evil and disastrous feud.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Doralice, who as courteous was as fair,<BR>
And ill-assured withal, how it would end,<BR>
Willingly granted Isabella&#8217;s prayer,<BR>
And straight to truce and peace disposed her friend,<BR>
As well Zerbino, by the other&#8217;s care,<BR>
Was brought his vengeful anger to suspend;<BR>
And, wending where she willed, the Scottish lord<BR>
Left unachieved the adventure of the sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Fair Flordelice, who ill maintained descries<BR>
The goodly sword of the unhappy count,<BR>
In secret garden, and so laments the prize<BR>
Foregone, she weeps for rage, and smite her front:<BR>
She would move Brandimart to this emprize;<BR>
And, should she find him, and the fact recount,<BR>
Weens, for short season will the Tartar foe<BR>
Exulting in the ravished faulchion go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Seeking him morn and evening, but in vain,<BR>
Flordelice after Brandimart did fare;<BR>
And widely wandered from him, who again<BR>
Already had to Paris made repair.<BR>
So far the damsel pricked by hill and plain,<BR>
She reached the passage of a river, where<BR>
She saw the wretched count; but what befel<BR>
The Scottish prince, Zerbino, let me tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
For to leave Durindana such misdeed<BR>
To him appeared, it past all other woes;<BR>
Though he could hardly sit upon his steed,<BR>
Though mighty loss of life-blood, which yet flows.<BR>
Now, when his anger and his heat secede,<BR>
After short interval, his anguish grows;<BR>
His anguish grows, with such impetuous pains,<BR>
He feels that life is ebbing from his veins.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
For weakness can the prince no further hie,<BR>
And so beside a fount is forced to stay:<BR>
Him to assist the pitying maid would try,<BR>
But knows not what to do, not what to say.<BR>
For lack of comfort she beholds him die;<BR>
Since every city is too far away,<BR>
Where in this need she could resort to leech,<BR>
Whose succour she might purchase or beseech.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
She, blaming Fortune, and the cruel sky,<BR>
Can only utter fond complaints and vain.<BR>
&#8220;Why sank I not in ocean, (was her cry,)<BR>
When first I reared my sail upon the main?&#8221;<BR>
Zerbino, who on her his languid eye<BR>
Had fixt, as she bemoaned her, felt more pain<BR>
Than that enduring and strong anguish bred,<BR>
Through which the suffering youth was well-nigh dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So be thou pleased, my heart,&#8221; (Zerbino cried,)<BR>
&#8220;To love me yet, when I am dead and gone,<BR>
As to abandon thee without a guide,<BR>
And not to die, distresses me alone.<BR>
For did it me in place secure betide<BR>
To end my days, this earthly journey done,<BR>
I cheerful, and content, and fully blest<BR>
Would die, since I should die upon thy breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But since to abandon thee, to whom a prize<BR>
I know not, my sad fate compels, I swear,<BR>
My Isabella, by that mouth, those eyes,<BR>
By what enchained me first, that lovely hair;<BR>
My spirit, troubled and despairing, hies<BR>
Into hell&#8217;s deep and gloomy bottom; where<BR>
To think, thou wert abandoned so by me,<BR>
Of all its woes the heaviest pain will be.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
At this the sorrowing Isabel, declining<BR>
Her mournful face, which with her tears o&#8217;erflows,<BR>
Towards the sufferer, and her mouth conjoining<BR>
To her Zerbino&#8217;s, languid as a rose;<BR>
Rose gathered out of season, and which, pining<BR>
Fades where it on the shadowy hedgerow grows,<BR>
Exclaims, &#8220;Without me think not so, my heart,<BR>
On this your last, long, journey to depart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of this, my heart, conceive not any fear,<BR>
For I will follow thee to heaven or hell;<BR>
It fits our souls together quit this sphere,<BR>
Together go, for aye together dwell.<BR>
No sooner closed thine eyelids shall appear<BR>
Than either me internal grief will quell,<BR>
Or, has it not such power, I here protest,<BR>
I with this sword to-day will pierce my breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I of our bodies cherish hope not light,<BR>
That they shall have a happier fate when dead:<BR>
Together to entomb them, may some wight,<BR>
Haply by pity moved, be hither led.&#8221;<BR>
She the poor remnants of his vital sprite<BR>
Went on collecting, as these words she said;<BR>
And while yet aught remains, with mournful lips,<BR>
The last faint breath of life devoutly sips.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas here his feeble voice Zerbino manned,<BR>
Crying, &#8220;My deity, I beg and pray,<BR>
By that love witnessed, when thy father&#8217;s land<BR>
Thou quittedst for my sake; and, if I may<BR>
In any thing command thee, I command,<BR>
That, with God&#8217;s pleasure, thou live-out thy day;<BR>
Nor ever banish from thy memory,<BR>
That, well as man can love, have I loved thee.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;God haply will provide thee with good aid,<BR>
To free thee from each churlish deed I fear;<BR>
As, when in the dark cavern thou wast stayed,<BR>
He sent, to rescue thee, Anglante&#8217;s peer;<BR>
So he (grammercy!) succoured thee dismaid<BR>
At sea, and from the wicked Biscayneer.<BR>
And, if thou must choose death, in place of worse,<BR>
Then only choose it, as a lesser curse.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
I think not these last words of Scotland&#8217;s knight<BR>
Were so exprest, that he was understood:<BR>
With these, he finished, like a feeble light,<BR>
Which needs supply of was, or other food.<BR>
&#8212;Who is there, that has power to tell aright<BR>
The gentle Isabella&#8217;s doleful mood?<BR>
When stiff, her loved Zerbino, with pale face,<BR>
And cold as ice, remained in her embrace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
On the ensanguined corse, in sorrow drowned,<BR>
The damsel throws herself, in her despair,<BR>
And shrieks so lout that wood and plain resound<BR>
For many miles about; nor does she spare<BR>
Bosom or cheek; but still, with cruel wound,<BR>
One and the other smites the afflicted fair;<BR>
And wrongs her curling lock of golden grain,<BR>
Aye calling on the well-loved youth in vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
She with such rage, such fury, was possest,<BR>
That, in her transport, she Zerbino&#8217;s glaive<BR>
Would easily have turned against her breast,<BR>
Ill keeping the command her lover gave;<BR>
But that a hermit, from his neighbouring rest,<BR>
Accustomed oft to seek the fountain-wave,<BR>
His flagon at the cooling stream to fill,<BR>
Opposed him to the damsel&#8217;s evil will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
The reverend father, who with natural sense<BR>
Abundant goodness happily combined,<BR>
And, with ensamples fraught and eloquence,<BR>
Was full of charity towards mankind,<BR>
With efficacious reasons her did fence,<BR>
And to endurance Isabel inclined;<BR>
Placing, from ancient Testament and new,<BR>
Women, as in a mirror, for her view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
The holy man next made the damsel see,<BR>
That save in God there was no true content,<BR>
And proved all other hope was transitory,<BR>
Fleeting, of little worth, and quickly spent;<BR>
And urged withal so earnestly his plea,<BR>
He changed her ill and obstinate intent;<BR>
And made her, for the rest of life, desire<BR>
To live devoted to her heavenly sire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Not that she would her mighty love forbear,<BR>
For her dead lord, nor yet his relics slight;<BR>
These, did she halt or journey, every where<BR>
Would Isabel have with her, day and night.<BR>
The hermit therefore seconding her care,<BR>
Who, for his age, was sound and full of might,<BR>
They on his mournful horse Zerbino placed,<BR>
And traversed many a day that woodland waste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
The cautious elder would not bear away<BR>
Thus all alone with him that damsel bland<BR>
Thither, where in a cave, concealed from day,<BR>
His solitary cell hard by did stand:<BR>
Within himself exclaiming: &#8220;I convey<BR>
With peril fire and fuel in one hand.&#8221;<BR>
Nor in such bold experiments the sage<BR>
Wisely would trust to prudence or to age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
He thought to bear her to Provence, where, near<BR>
The city of Marseilles a borough stood,<BR>
Which had a sumptuous monastery; here<BR>
Of ladies was a holy sisterhood;<BR>
And, hither to transport the cavalier,<BR>
They stowed his body in a chest of wood,<BR>
Made in a town by the way-side; and which<BR>
Was long and roomy, and well closed with pitch.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
So, compassing a mighty round, they fare<BR>
Through wildest parts, for many and many a day;<BR>
Because, the war extending every where,<BR>
They seek to hide themselves as best they may:<BR>
At length a cavalier arrests the pair,<BR>
That with foul scorn and outrage bars their way;<BR>
Of whom you more in fitting time shall learn,<BR>
But to the Tartar king I now return.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
After the fight between the two was done,<BR>
Already told by me, the king withdrew<BR>
To a cooling shade and river from the sun,<BR>
His horse&#8217;s reins and saddle to undo;<BR>
Letting the courser at his pleasure run,<BR>
Browsing the tender grass the pasture through:<BR>
But he reposed short time ere he descried<BR>
An errant knight descend the mountain&#8217;s side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Him Doralice, as soon as he his front<BR>
Uplifted, knew; and showed him to her knight:<BR>
Saying: &#8220;Behold! the haughty Rodomont,<BR>
Unless the distance has deceived my sight.<BR>
To combat with thee, he descends the mount:<BR>
Now it behoves thee put forth all thy might.<BR>
To lose me, his betrothed, a mighty cross<BR>
The monarch deems, and comes to venge his loss.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
As a good hawk, who duck or woodcock shy,<BR>
Partridge or pigeon, or such other prey,<BR>
Seeing towards her from a distance fly,<BR>
Raises her head, and shows her blithe and gay;<BR>
So Mandricardo, in security<BR>
Of crushing Rodomont in that affray,<BR>
Gladly his courser seized, bestrode the seat,<BR>
Reined him, and in the stirrups fixt his feet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
When the two hostile warriors were so near,<BR>
That words could be exchanged between the twain,<BR>
Loudly began the monarch of Argier<BR>
To threat with head and hand, in haughty strain,<BR>
That to repentance he will bring the peer<BR>
Who lightly for a pleasure, rash and vain,<BR>
Had scrupled not his anger to excite<BR>
Who dearly will the offered scorn requite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
When Mandricardo: &#8220;He but vainly tries<BR>
To fright, who threatens me&#8212;by words unscared.<BR>
Woman, or child, or him he terrifies,<BR>
Witless of warfare; not me, who regard<BR>
With more delight than rest, which others prize,<BR>
The stirring battle; and who am prepared<BR>
My foeman in the lists or field to meet;<BR>
Armed or unarmed, on horse or on my feet.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
They pass to outrage, shout, and ire, unsheath<BR>
The brand; and loudly smites each cruel foe;<BR>
Like winds, which scarce at first appear to breathe,<BR>
Next shake the oak and ash-tree as they blow;<BR>
Then to the skies upwhirl the dusty wreath,<BR>
Then level forests, and lay houses low,<BR>
And bear the storm abroad, o&#8217;er land and main,<BR>
By which the flocks in greenwood-holt are slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Of those two infidels, unmatched in worth,<BR>
The valiant heart and strength, which thus exceed,<BR>
To such a warfare and such blows give birth,<BR>
As suits with warrior of so bold a seed.<BR>
At the loud sound and horrid, trembles earth,<BR>
When the swords cross; and to the stroke succeed<BR>
Quick sparks; or rather, flashing to the sky,<BR>
Bright flames by thousands and by thousands fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Without once gathering breath, without repose,<BR>
The champions one another still assail;<BR>
Striving, now here, now there, with deadly blows,<BR>
To rive the plate, or penetrate the mail.<BR>
Nor this one gains, nor the other ground foregoes;<BR>
But, as if girded in by fosse or pale,<BR>
Or, as too dearly sold they deem an inch,<BR>
Ne&#8217;er from their close and narrow circle flinch.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
Mid thousand blows, so, with two-handed swing,<BR>
On his foe&#8217;s forehead smote the Tartar knight,<BR>
He made him see, revolving in a ring,<BR>
Myriads of fiery balls and sparks of light.<BR>
The croupe, with head reversed, the Sarzan king<BR>
Now smote, as if deprived of all his might,<BR>
The stirrups lost; and in her sight, so well<BR>
Beloved, appeared about to quit the sell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
But as steel arbalest that&#8217;s loaded sore,<BR>
By how much is the engine charged and strained,<BR>
By lever or by crane, with so much more<BR>
Fury returns, its ancient bent regained,<BR>
And, in discharging its destructive store,<BR>
Inflicts worse evil than itself sustained;<BR>
So rose that African with ready blade,<BR>
And straight with double force the stroke repaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
Rodomont smites, and in the very place<BR>
Where he was smit, the Tartar in return;<BR>
But cannot wound the Sarzan in the face,<BR>
Because his Trojan arms the weapon turn;<BR>
Yes so astounds, he leaves him not in case,<BR>
If it be morn or evening to discern.<BR>
Rodomont stopt not, but in fury sped<BR>
A second blow, still aiming at his head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
King Mandricardo&#8217;s courser, who abhorred<BR>
The whistling of the steel which round him flew,<BR>
Saved, with sore mischief to himself, his lord;<BR>
In that he backed the faulchion to eschew:<BR>
Aimed at his master, not at him, the sword<BR>
Smote him across the head, and cleft it through.<BR>
No Trojan helm defends the wretched horse,<BR>
Like Mandricardo, and he dies parforce.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
He falls, and Mandricardo on the plain<BR>
No more astound, slides down upon his feet,<BR>
And whirls his sword; to see his courser slain<BR>
He storms all over fired with angry heat.<BR>
At him the Sarzan monarch drives amain;<BR>
Who stands as firm as rock which billows beat.<BR>
And so it happened, that the courser good<BR>
Fell in the charge, while fast the footman stood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
The African, who feels his horse give way,<BR>
The stirrups quits, and lightly from the sell<BR>
Is freed, and springs on earth: for the assay<BR>
Hence matched anew, stands either infidel.<BR>
Worse than before the battle boils, while they<BR>
With pride and anger, and with hatred swell,<BR>
About to close; but that, with flowing rein,<BR>
A messenger arrives to part the twain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
A messenger arrives, that from the Moor,<BR>
With many others, news through France conveyed;<BR>
Who word to simple knight and captain bore,<BR>
To join the troops, beneath their flags arrayed.<BR>
For he, the emperor, who the lilies wore,<BR>
Siege to their quarters had already laid;<BR>
And, save quick succour thither was addrest,<BR>
He read, their army&#8217;s scathe was manifest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
The Moorish messenger not only knows,<BR>
By ensigns and by vest, the warlike pair,<BR>
But by the circling blades, and furious blows,<BR>
With which no other hands could wound the air;<BR>
Hence dared not &#8217;twixt champions interpose,<BR>
Nor deemed his orders an assurance were<BR>
From such impetuous fury, nor the saw,<BR>
Which says embassadors are safe by law:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
But to fair Doralice approached, and said<BR>
Marsilius, Agramant, and Stordilane,<BR>
Within weak works, with scanty troops to aid,<BR>
Were close beleaguered by the Christian train.<BR>
And, having told his tale, the damsel prayed,<BR>
That this she to the warriors would explain;<BR>
And would accord the pair, and to their post<BR>
Dispatch, for rescue of the Moorish host.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
The lady, with bold heart, &#8217;twixt either foe<BR>
Threw herself, and exclaimed: &#8220;I you command,<BR>
By the large love you hear me, as I know,<BR>
That you to better use reserve the brand;<BR>
And that you instantly in succour go<BR>
Of our host, menaced by the Christian band;<BR>
Which now, besieged within its camp, attends<BR>
Ruin or speedy succour from its friends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
The messenger rehearsed, when she had done,<BR>
Fully the peril of the paynim train;<BR>
And said that he bore letters to the son<BR>
Of Ulien, from the son of King Troyane.<BR>
The message ended, every grudge foregone,<BR>
&#8217;Twas finally resolved between the twain,<BR>
They should conclude a truce, and till the day<BR>
The Moorish siege was raised, their strife delay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
Intending, when from siege their Chivalry<BR>
Shall be relieved&#8212;the one and the other knight&#8212;<BR>
No longer to remain in company,<BR>
But bandy cruel war was with fell despite,<BR>
Until determined by their arms shall be<BR>
To whom the royal dame belongs of right.<BR>
And she, between whose hands their solemn troth<BR>
They plighted, was security for both.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
DISCORD, at hearing this, impatient grew;<BR>
With any truce or treaty ill content:<BR>
And that such fair agreement should ensue,<BR>
PRIDE, who was present, could as ill consent:<BR>
But LOVE was there, more puissant than the two,<BR>
Equalled of none in lofty hardiment;<BR>
And launching from his bow his shafts of proof,<BR>
With these, made PRIDE and DISCORD stand aloof.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
To keep the truce the rival warriors swore;<BR>
Since so it pleased her well, who either swayed.<BR>
One of their coursers lacked: for on the moor<BR>
Lifeless King Mandricardo&#8217;s had been laid:<BR>
Hence, thither, in good time, came Brigliador,<BR>
Who, feeding, by the river&#8217;s margin strayed.<BR>
But here I find me at my canto&#8217;s end;<BR>
So, with your licence, shall the tale suspend.</TD></TR>
