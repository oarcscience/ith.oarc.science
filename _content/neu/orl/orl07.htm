<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Rogero, as directed by the pair,<BR>
The giantess Eriphila o&#8217;erthrows.<BR>
That done, he to Alcina&#8217;s labyrinth, where<BR>
More than one knight is tied and prisoned, goes.<BR>
To him Melissa sage the secret snare,<BR>
And remedy for that grave evil shows.<BR>
Whence he, by her advised, with downcast eye,<BR>
And full of shame forthwith resolves to fly.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> traveller, he, whom sea or mountain sunder<BR>
From his own country, sees things strange and new;<BR>
That the misjudging vulgar, which lies under<BR>
The mist of ignorance, esteems untrue:<BR>
Rejecting whatsoever is a wonder,<BR>
Unless &#8217;tis palpable and plain to view:<BR>
Hence inexperience, as I know full well,<BR>
Will yield small credence to the tale I tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
But this be great or small, I know not why<BR>
The rabble&#8217;s silly judgement I should fear,<BR>
Convinced <I>you</I> will not think the tale a lie,<BR>
In whom the light of reason shines so clear.<BR>
And hence to you it is I only try<BR>
The fruit of my fatigues to render dear.<BR>
I ended where Eriphila in guard<BR>
Of bridge and stream was seen, the passage barred.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Of finest metal was her armour bright,<BR>
With gems of many colours overspread,<BR>
The tawny jacinth, yellow chyrsolite,<BR>
The emerald green of hue, and ruby red.<BR>
Mounted, but not on palfrey, for the fight:<BR>
In place of that, she on a wolf had sped,<BR>
Sped on a wolf towards the pass; and rode<BR>
On sell, that rich beyond all custom showed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
No larger wolf, I ween, Apulia roams;<BR>
More huge than bull; unguided by her hand;<BR>
Although upon no bit the monster foams,<BR>
Docile, I know not why, to her command.<BR>
The accursed Plague, arrayed in surcoat, comes<BR>
Above her arms, in colour like the sand;<BR>
That, saving in its dye, was of the sort<BR>
Which bishops and which prelates wear at court.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
The giantess&#8217;s crest and shield appear,<BR>
For ensign, decked with swoln and poisonous toad.<BR>
Her the two damsels to the cavalier<BR>
Before the bridge, prepared for battle, showed,<BR>
Threatening, as wont to some, with levelled spear,<BR>
To do the warrior scorn and bar the road.<BR>
Bidding him turn, she to Rogero cries;<BR>
A lance he takes, and threats her and defies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
As quick and daring, the gigantic Pest<BR>
Spurred her wolf, seated well for that dread game:<BR>
In mid career she laid her lance in rest,<BR>
And made earth quake beneath her as she came;<BR>
Yet at the encounter fierce the champaign pressed;<BR>
For underneath the casque, with stedfast aim, <BR>
So hard Rogero smote her, that he bore<BR>
The beldam backward six good yards and more:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
And came already with his lifted blade,<BR>
Drawn for that end, to take her haughty head;<BR>
To him an easy task; for she was laid<BR>
Among the grass and flowers, like one that&#8217;s dead.<BR>
But, &#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis enough that she is vanquished,&#8221; said<BR>
The pair: &#8220;No further press thy vengeance dread.<BR>
Sheathe, courteous cavalier, thy sword anew:<BR>
Pass we the river, and our way pursue.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Along the path, which through a forest lay,<BR>
Roughish and somedeal ill to beat, they went.<BR>
Besides that strait and stony was the way,<BR>
This, nigh directly, scaled a hill&#8217;s ascent.<BR>
But, when arrived upon the summit, they<BR>
Issued upon a mead of vast extent;<BR>
And a more pleasant palace on that green<BR>
Beheld, and brighter than was ever seen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
To meet the child, Alcina, fair of hue,<BR>
Advanced some way beyond the outer gate;<BR>
And, girded by a gay and courtly crew,<BR>
Rogero there received in lordly state:<BR>
While all the rest to him such honour do,<BR>
And on the knight with such deep reverence wait,<BR>
They could not have displayed more zeal and love,<BR>
Had Jove descended from the choirs above.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Not so much does the palace, fair to see,<BR>
In riches other princely domes excel,<BR>
As that the gentlest, fairest, company<BR>
Which the whole world contains, within it dwell:<BR>
Of either sex, with small variety<BR>
Between, in youth and beauty matched as well:<BR>
The fay alone exceeds the rest as far<BR>
As the bright sun outshines each lesser star.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Her shape is of such perfect symmetry,<BR>
As best to feign the industrious painter knows,<BR>
With long and knotted tresses; to the eye<BR>
Not yellow gold with brighter lustre glows.<BR>
Upon her tender cheek the mingled dye<BR>
Is scattered, of the lily and the rose.<BR>
Like ivory smooth, the forehead gay and round<BR>
Fills up the space, and forms a fitting bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Two black and slender arches rise above<BR>
Two clear black eyes, say suns of radiant light,<BR>
Which ever softly beam and slowly move;<BR>
Round these appears to sport in frolic flight,<BR>
Hence scattering all his shafts, the little Love,<BR>
And seems to plunder hearts in open sight.<BR>
Thence, through mid visage, does the nose descend,<BR>
Where Envy finds not blemish to amend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
As if between two vales, which softly curl,<BR>
The mouth with vermeil tint is seen to glow:<BR>
Within are strung two rows of orient pearl,<BR>
Which her delicious lips shut up or show.<BR>
Of force to melt the heart of any churl,<BR>
However rude, hence courteous accents flow;<BR>
And here that gentle smile receives its birth,<BR>
Which opes at will a paradise on earth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Like milk the bosom, and the neck of snow;<BR>
Round is the neck, and full and large the breast;<BR>
Where, fresh and firm, two ivory apples grow,<BR>
Which rise and fall, as, to the margin pressed<BR>
By pleasant breeze, the billows come and go.<BR>
Not prying Argus could discern the rest.<BR>
Yet might the observing eye of things concealed<BR>
Conjecture safely, from the charms revealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
To all her arms a just proportion bear,<BR>
And a white hand is oftentimes descried,<BR>
Which narrow is, and somedeal long; and where<BR>
No knot appears, nor vein is signified.<BR>
For finish of that stately shape and rare,<BR>
A foot, neat, short, and round, beneath is spied.<BR>
Angelic visions, creatures of the sky,<BR>
Concealed beneath no covering veil can lie.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
A springe is planted in Rogero&#8217;s way,<BR>
On all sides did she speak, smile, sing, or move;<BR>
No wonder then the stripling was her prey,<BR>
Who in the fairy saw such show of love.<BR>
With him the guilt and falsehood little weigh,<BR>
Of which the offended myrtle told above.<BR>
Nor will he think that perfidy and guile<BR>
Can be united with so sweet a smile.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
No! he could now believe, by magic art,<BR>
Astolpho well transformed upon the plain,<BR>
For punishment of foul ungrateful heart,<BR>
And haply meriting severer pain.<BR>
And, as for all he heard him late impart,<BR>
&#8217;Twas prompted by revenge, &#8217;twas false and vain.<BR>
By hate and malice was the sufferer stung,<BR>
To blame and wound the fay with slanderous tongue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The beauteous lady whom he loved so well<BR>
Is newly banished from his altered breast;<BR>
For (such the magic of Alcina&#8217;s spell)<BR>
She every ancient passion dispossessed;<BR>
And in his bosom, there alone to dwell,<BR>
The image of her love, and self impressed.<BR>
So witched, Rogero sure some grace deserves,<BR>
If from his faith his frail affection swerves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
At board lyre, lute and harp of tuneful string,<BR>
And other sounds, in mixed diversity,<BR>
Made, round about, the joyous palace ring,<BR>
With glorious concert and sweet harmony.<BR>
Nor lacked there well-accorded voice to sing<BR>
Of love, its passion and its ecstasy;<BR>
Nor who, with rare inventions, choicely versed,<BR>
Delightful fiction to the guests rehearsed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
What table, spread by whatsoever heir<BR>
Of Ninus, though triumphant were the board,<BR>
Or what more famous and more costly, where<BR>
Cleopatra feasted with the Latian lord,<BR>
Could with this banquet&#8217;s matchless joys compare,<BR>
By the fond fairy for Rogero stored?<BR>
I think not such a feast is spread above,<BR>
Where Ganymede presents the cup to Jove.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
They form a ring, the board and festive cheer<BR>
Removed, and sitting, play a merry game:<BR>
Each asks, still whispering in a neighbour&#8217;s ear,<BR>
What secret pleases best; to knight and dame<BR>
A fair occasion, without let or fear,<BR>
Their love, unheard of any, to proclaim.<BR>
And in conclusion the two lovers plight<BR>
Their word, to meet together on that night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Soon, and much sooner than their wont, was ended<BR>
The game at which the palace inmates play:<BR>
When pages on the troop with torches tended,<BR>
And with their radiance chased the night away.<BR>
To seek his bed the paladin ascended,<BR>
Girt with that goodly squadron, in a gay<BR>
And airy bower, appointed for his rest,<BR>
Mid all the others chosen as the best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
And when of comfits and of cordial wine<BR>
A fitting proffer has been made anew,<BR>
The guests their bodies reverently incline,<BR>
And to their bowers depart the courtly crew.<BR>
He upon perfumed sheets, whose texture fine<BR>
Seemed of Arachne&#8217;s loom, his body threw:<BR>
Hearkening this while with still attentive ears,<BR>
If he the coming of the lady hears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
At every movement heard on distant floor,<BR>
Hoping &#8217;twas her, Rogero raised his head:<BR>
He thinks he hears; but it is heard no more,<BR>
Then sighs at his mistake: ofttimes from bed<BR>
He issued, and undid his chamber door,<BR>
And peeped abroad, but still no better sped;<BR>
And cursed a thousand times the hour that she<BR>
So long retarded his felicity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yes, now she comes,&#8221; the stripling often said,<BR>
And reckoned up the paces, as he lay,<BR>
Which from her bower where haply to be made<BR>
To that where he was waiting for the fay.<BR>
These thoughts, and other thoughts as vain, he weighed<BR>
Before she came, and restless at her stay,<BR>
Often believed some hinderance, yet unscanned,<BR>
Might interpose between the fruit and hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
At length, when dropping sweets the costly fay<BR>
Had put some end to her perfumery,<BR>
The time now come she need no more delay,<BR>
Since all was hushed within the palace, she<BR>
Stole from her bower alone, through secret way,<BR>
And passed towards the chamber silently,<BR>
Where on his couch the youthful cavalier<BR>
Lay, with a heart long torn by Hope and Fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
When the successor of Astolpho spies<BR>
Those smiling stars above him, at the sight<BR>
A flame, like that of kindled sulphur, flies<BR>
Through his full veins, as ravished by delight<BR>
Out of himself; and now up to the eyes<BR>
Plunged in a sea of bliss, he swims outright.<BR>
He leaps from bed and folds her to his breast,<BR>
Nor waits until the lady he undressed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Though but in a light sendal clad, that she<BR>
Wore in the place of farthingale or gown;<BR>
Which o&#8217;er a shift of finest quality,<BR>
And white, about her limbs the fay had thrown:<BR>
The mantle yielded at his touch, as he<BR>
Embraced her, and that veil remained alone,<BR>
Which upon every side the damsel shows,<BR>
More than clear glass the lily or the rose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
The plant no closer does the ivy clip,<BR>
With whose green boughs its stem is interlaced.<BR>
Than those fond lovers, each from either&#8217;s lip<BR>
The balmy breath collecting, he embraced:<BR>
Rich perfume this, whose like no seed or slip<BR>
Bears in sweet Indian or Sab&aelig;an waste;<BR>
While so to speak their joys is either fixed,<BR>
That oftentimes those meeting lips are mixed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
These things were carried closely by the dame<BR>
And youth, or if surmised, were never bruited;<BR>
For silence seldom was a cause for blame,<BR>
But oftener as a virtue well reputed.<BR>
By those shrewd courtiers, conscious of his claim,<BR>
Rogero is with proffers fair saluted:<BR>
Worshipped of all those inmates, who fulfil<BR>
In this the enamoured far, Alcina&#8217;s will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
No pleasure is omitted there; since they<BR>
Alike are prisoners in Love&#8217;s magic hall.<BR>
They change their raiment twice or thrice a day,<BR>
Now for this use, and now at other call.<BR>
&#8217;Tis often feast, and always holiday;<BR>
&#8217;Tis wrestling, tourney, pageant, bath, and ball.<BR>
Now underneath a hill by fountain cast,<BR>
They read the amorous lays of ages past:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Now by glad hill, or through the shady dale,<BR>
They hunt the fearful hare, and now they flush<BR>
With busy dog, sagacious of the trail,<BR>
Wild pheasant from the stubble-field or bush.<BR>
Now where green junipers perfume the gale,<BR>
Suspend the snare, or lime the fluttering thrush:<BR>
And casting now for fish, with net or hook,<BR>
Disturb their secret haunts in pleasant brook.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero revels there, in like delight,<BR>
While Charles and Agramant are troubled sore.<BR>
But not for him their story will I slight,<BR>
Nor Bradamant forget; who evermore,<BR>
Mid toilsome pain and care, her cherished knight,<BR>
Ravished from her, did many a day deplore;<BR>
Whom by unwonted ways, transported through<BR>
Mid air, the damsel saw, nor whither knew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Of her I speak before the royal pair,<BR>
Who many days pursued her search in vain;<BR>
By shadowy wood, or over champaign bare,<BR>
By farm and city, and by hill and plain;<BR>
But seeks her cherished friend with fruitless care,<BR>
Divided by such space of land and main:<BR>
Often she goes among the Paynim spears,<BR>
Yet never aught of her Rogero hears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Of hundreds questioned, upon every side,<BR>
Each day, no answer ever gives content.<BR>
She roams from post to post, and far and wide<BR>
Searches pavilion, lodging, booth, or rent,<BR>
And this, mid foot or horsemen, unespied,<BR>
May safely do, without impediment,<BR>
Thanks to the ring, whose more than mortal aid,<BR>
When in her mouth, conceals the vanished maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
She cannot, will not, think that he is dead;<BR>
Because the wreck of such a noble knight<BR>
Would, from Hydaspes&#8217; distant waves have spread,<BR>
To where the sun descends with westering light.<BR>
She knows not what to think, nor whither sped,<BR>
He roams in earth or air; yet, hapless wight,<BR>
Him ever seeks, and for attendant train<BR>
Has sobs and sighs, and every bitter pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
At length to find the wondrous cave she thought,<BR>
Where the prophetic homes of Merlin lie,<BR>
And there lament herself until she wrought<BR>
Upon the pitying marble to reply;<BR>
For thence, if yet he lived would she be taught,<BR>
Of this glad life to hard necessity<BR>
Had yielded up; and, when she was possessed<BR>
Of the seer&#8217;s councils, would pursue the best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
With this intention, Bradamant her way<BR>
Directed thither, where in Poictier&#8217;s wood<BR>
The vocal tomb, containing Merlin&#8217;s clay,<BR>
Concealed in Alpine place and savage, stood.<BR>
But that enchantress sage, who night and day<BR>
Thought of the damsel, watchful for her good,<BR>
She, I repeat, who taught her what should be<BR>
In that fair grotto her posterity;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
She who preserved her with protecting care,<BR>
That same enchantress, still benign and wise,<BR>
Who, knowing she a matchless race should bear<BR>
Of men, or rather semi-deities,<BR>
Spies daily what her thoughts and actions are,<BR>
And lots for her each day, divining, tries;&#8212;<BR>
She all Rogero&#8217;s fortune knew, how freed;<BR>
Then borne to India by the griffin-steed:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Him on that courser plainly she had eyed,<BR>
Who would not the controlling rein obey;<BR>
When, severed by such interval, he hied,<BR>
Borne through the perilous, unwonted way:<BR>
And knew that he sport, dance, and banquet plied,<BR>
And lapt in idleness and pleasure lay;<BR>
Nor memory of his lord nor of the dame,<BR>
Once loved so well, preserved, not of his fame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
And thus such gentle knight ingloriously<BR>
Would have consumed his fairest years and best,<BR>
In long inaction, afterwards to be,<BR>
Body and soul, destroyed; and <I>that</I>, possessed<BR>
Alone by us in perpetuity.<BR>
That flower, whose sweets outlive the fragile rest<BR>
Which quickens man when he in earth is laid,<BR>
Would have been plucked or severed in the blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
But that enchantress kind, who with more care<BR>
Than for himself he watched, still kept the knight,<BR>
Designed to drag him, by rough road and bare,<BR>
Towards true virtue, in his own despite;<BR>
As often cunning leech will burn and pare<BR>
The flesh, and poisonous drug employ aright:<BR>
Who, though at first his cruel art offend,<BR>
Is thanked, since he preserves us in the end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
She, not like old Atlantes, rendered blind<BR>
By the great love she to the stripling bore,<BR>
Set not on gifting him with life her mind,<BR>
As was the scope of that enchanter hoar;<BR>
Who, reckless all of fame and praise declined,<BR>
Wished length of days to his Rogero more<BR>
Than that, to win a world&#8217;s applause, the peer<BR>
Should of his joyous life forego one year.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
By him he to Alcina&#8217;s isle had been<BR>
Dispatched, that in her palace he might dwell,<BR>
Forgetting arms; and, as enchanter seen<BR>
In magic and the use of every spell,<BR>
The heart had fastened of that fairy-queen,<BR>
Enamoured of the gentle youth, so well,<BR>
That she the knot would never disengage,<BR>
Though he should live to more than Nestor&#8217;s age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
Returning now to her that well foreknew<BR>
Whatever was to come to pass, I say<BR>
She thither did her journey straight pursue,<BR>
Where she met Aymon&#8217;s daughter by the way<BR>
Forlorn and wandering: Bradamant at view<BR>
Of her enchantress, erst to grief a prey,<BR>
Changes it all to hope: the other tells<BR>
That with Alcina her Rogero dwells.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Nigh dead the maid remains, in piteous guise,<BR>
Hearing of him so far removed, and more<BR>
Grieves that she danger to her love descries,<BR>
Save this some strong and speedy cure restore.<BR>
But her the enchantress comforts, and applies<BR>
A salve where it was needed most, and swore<BR>
That few short days should pass before anew<BR>
Rogero should return to glad her view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Since thou, an antidote to sorcery,<BR>
Lady (she said), the virtuous ring dost wear,<BR>
I have no doubt if to yon island I<BR>
This, where thine every good is hidden, hear,<BR>
To foil Alcina&#8217;s wiles and witchery,<BR>
And thence to bring thee back thy cherished care.<BR>
This evening, early, will I hence away,<BR>
And be in India by the break of day.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
And told to her, the tale continuing,<BR>
The mode which she was purposing to employ,<BR>
From that effeminate, soft realm to bring<BR>
Back into warlike France the cherished boy.<BR>
Bradamant from her finger slipt the ring,<BR>
Nor this alone would have bestowed with joy;<BR>
But heart and life would at her feet have laid,<BR>
If she had deemed they could Rogero aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Giving the ring, her cause she recommends<BR>
To her, and recommends Rogero more.<BR>
Countless salutes by her the damsel sends,<BR>
Then of Provence, departing seeks the shore.<BR>
The enchantress to another quarter wends;<BR>
And, for the execution of her lore,<BR>
Conjures, that eve, a palfrey, by her art,<BR>
With one foot red, black every other part.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Some Farfarello, or Alchino he,<BR>
I think, whom in that form she raised from hell;<BR>
And with loose hair, dishevelled horribly,<BR>
Ungirt and barefoot, mounted in the sell.<BR>
But, with wise caution, from her finger she<BR>
Withdrew the ring, lest it should mar the spell:<BR>
And then by him was with such swiftness born,<BR>
She in Alcina&#8217;s isle arrived at morn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Herself she changed with wonderful disguise,<BR>
Adding a palm of stature to her height;<BR>
And made her limbs of a proportioned size;<BR>
And of the very measure seemed to sight,<BR>
As was she deemed, the necromancer wise,<BR>
Who with such care had reared the youthful knight.<BR>
With long-descending beard she clothed her chin,<BR>
And wrinkled o&#8217;er her front and other skin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
To imitate his speech, and face, and cheer,<BR>
She knew so well, that, by the youth descried,<BR>
She might the sage Atlantes&#8217; self appear;<BR>
Next hid, and watched so long, that she espied<BR>
Upon a day (rare chance) the cavalier<BR>
At length detached from his Alcina&#8217;s side:<BR>
For still, in motion or at rest, the fay<BR>
Ill bore the youth should be an hour away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Alone she finds him, fitting well her will,<BR>
As he enjoys the pure and morning air<BR>
Beside a brook, which trickled from a hill,<BR>
Streaming towards a limpid lake and fair.<BR>
His fine, soft garments, wove with cunning skill,<BR>
All over, ease and wantonness declare;<BR>
These with her hand, such subtle toil well taught,<BR>
For him in silk and gold Alcina wrought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
About the stripling&#8217;s neck, a splendid string<BR>
Of gems, descending to mid-breast, is wound;<BR>
On each once manly arm, now glittering<BR>
With the bright hoop, a bracelet fair is bound.<BR>
Pierced with golden wire, in form of ring,<BR>
Is either ear; and from the yellow round<BR>
Depend two precious pearls; not such the coast<BR>
Of Araby or sumptuous India boast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Crisped into comely ringlets was his hair,<BR>
Wet with the costliest odours and the best;<BR>
And soft and amorous all his gestures were,<BR>
Like one who does Valentian lady&#8217;s hest.<BR>
In him, beside his name, was nothing fair,<BR>
And more than half corrupted all the rest.<BR>
So was Rogero found, within that dell,<BR>
Changed from his former self by potent spell.</TD></TR>

Him in the figure of Atlantes sage<BR>
She fronts, who bore the enchanter&#8217;s borrowed cheer;<BR>
With that grave face, and reverend with age,<BR>
Which he was always wonted to revere;<BR>
And with that eye, which in his pupillage,<BR>
Beaming with wrath, he whilom so did fear.<BR>
And sternly cries, &#8220;Is this the fruit at last<BR>
Which pays my tedious pain and labour past?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The marrow of the lion and the bear<BR>
Didst thou for this thine early banquet make,<BR>
And, trained by me, by cliff or cavern-lair,<BR>
Strangle with infant hands the crested snake;<BR>
Their claws from tiger and from panther tear,<BR>
And tusks from living boar in tangled brake,<BR>
That, bred in such a school, in thee should I<BR>
Alcina&#8217;s Atys or Adonis spy?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Is this the hope that stars, observed by me,<BR>
Signs in conjunction, sacred fibres, bred;<BR>
With what beside of dream or augury,<BR>
And all those lots I but too deeply read,<BR>
Which, while yet hanging at the breast, of thee,<BR>
When these thy years should be accomplished, said,<BR>
Thy fears should so be bruited far and near,<BR>
Thou justly should be deemed without a peer?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This does, in truth, a fair beginning show;<BR>
A seed which, we may hope, will soon conceive<BR>
A Julius, Alexander, Scipio.<BR>
Who thee Alcina&#8217;s bondsman could believe;<BR>
And (for the world the shameful fact might know)<BR>
That all should, manifest to sight, perceive<BR>
Upon thy neck and arms the servile chains,<BR>
Wherewith she at her will her captive trains?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If thine own single honour move not thee,<BR>
And the high deeds which thou art called to do,<BR>
Wherefore defraud thy fair posterity<BR>
Of what, was oft predicted, should ensue?<BR>
Alas! why seal the womb God willed should be<BR>
Pregnant by thee with an illustrious crew,<BR>
That far renowned, and more than human line,<BR>
Destined the sun in glory to outshine?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Forbid not of the noblest souls the birth,<BR>
Formed in the ideas of <SMALL>ETERNAL MIND</SMALL>,<BR>
Destined, from age to age, to visit earth,<BR>
Sprung from thy stock, and clothed in corporal rind;<BR>
The spring of thousand palms and festal mirth,<BR>
Through which, to Italy with losses pined<BR>
And wounds, thy good descendants shall restore<BR>
The fame and honours she enjoyed of yore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not only should these many souls have weight<BR>
To bend thy purpose, holy souls, and bright,<BR>
Which from thy fruitful tree shall vegetate;<BR>
But, though alone, a single couple might<BR>
Suffice a nobler feeling to create,<BR>
Alphonso and his brother Hyppolite:<BR>
Whose like was seldom witnessed to this time,<BR>
Through all the paths whence men to virtue climb.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I was more wont to dwell upon this pair<BR>
Than all the rest, of whom I prophesied;<BR>
As well that these a greater part should bear<BR>
In lofty virtues, as that I descried<BR>
Thee, listening to my lore with closer care,<BR>
Than to the tale of all thy seed beside.<BR>
I saw thee joy that such a pair would shine<BR>
Amid the heroes of thy noble line.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Say, what has she, thou makest thy fancy&#8217;s queen,<BR>
More than what other courtezans possess?<BR>
Who of so many concubine has been;<BR>
How used her lovers in the end to bless,<BR>
Thou truly know&#8217;st: but that she may be seen<BR>
Without disguise, and in her real dress,<BR>
This ring, returning, on thy finger wear,<BR>
And thou shalt see the dame, and mark how fair.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Abashed and mute, Rogero, listening,<BR>
In vain to her reproof an answer sought:<BR>
Who on his little finger put the ring,<BR>
Whose virtue to himself the warrior brought.<BR>
And such remorse and shame within him spring,<BR>
When on his altered sense the change is wrought,<BR>
A thousand fathoms deep he fain would lie<BR>
Buried in earth, unseen of any eye.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
So speaking, to the natural shape she wore<BR>
Before his eyes returned the magic dame;<BR>
Nor old Atlantes&#8217; form was needed more,<BR>
The good effect obtained for which she came.<BR>
To tell you that which was not told before,<BR>
Melissa was the sage enchantress&#8217; name:<BR>
Who to Rogero now her purpose said,<BR>
And told with what design she thither sped:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Dispatched by her, who him in anxious pain<BR>
Desires, nor longer can without him be,<BR>
With the intent to loose him from the chain<BR>
Wherewith he was begirt by sorcery;<BR>
And had put on, more credence to obtain,<BR>
Atlantes de Carena&#8217;s form; but she,<BR>
Seeing his health restored, now willed the youth,<BR>
Through her should hear and see the very truth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That gentle lady who so loves thee, who<BR>
Were well deserving love upon thy part;<BR>
To whom (unless forgot, thou know&#8217;st how true<BR>
The tale) thou debtor for thy freedom art,<BR>
This ring, which can each magic spell undo,<BR>
Sends for thy succour, and would send her heart,<BR>
If with such virtue fraught, her heart could bring<BR>
Thee safely in thy perils, like the ring.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
How Bradamant had loved, and loves, she says,<BR>
Continuing to Rogero her relation:<BR>
To this, her worth commends with fitting praise,<BR>
Tempering in truth and fondness her narration;<BR>
And still employs the choicest mode and phrase,<BR>
Which fits one skilful in negociation,<BR>
And on the false Alcina brings such hate,<BR>
As on things horrible is wont to wait;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Brings hate on that which he so loved before;<BR>
Nor let the tale astonish which you hear,<BR>
For since his love was forced by magic lore,<BR>
The ring the false enchantment served to clear.<BR>
This too unmasked the charms Alcina wore,<BR>
And made all false, from head to food, appear.<BR>
None of her own, but borrowed, all he sees,<BR>
And the once sparkling cup now drugged with lees.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Like boy who somewhere his ripe fruit bestows,<BR>
And next forgets the place where it is laid,<BR>
Then, after many days, conducted goes<BR>
By chance, where he the rich deposit made,<BR>
And wonders that the hidden treasure shows,<BR>
Not what it is, but rotten and decayed;<BR>
And hates, and scorns, and loathes, with altered eyes,<BR>
And throws away what he was used to prize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Rogero thus, when by Melissa&#8217;s lore<BR>
Advised, he to behold the fay returned,<BR>
And that good ring of sovereign virtue wore,<BR>
Which, on the finger placed, all spells o&#8217;erturned;<BR>
For that fair damsel he had left before,<BR>
To his surprise, so foul a dame discerned,<BR>
That in this ample world, examined round,<BR>
A hag so old and hideous is not found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Pale, lean, and wrinkled was the face, and white,<BR>
And thinly clothed with hair Alcina&#8217;s head;<BR>
Her stature reached not to six palms in height,<BR>
And every tooth was gone; for she had led<BR>
A longer life than ever mortal wight,<BR>
Than Hecuba or she in Cuma bred;<BR>
But thus by practice, to our age unknown,<BR>
Appeared with youth and beauty not her own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
By art she gave herself the lovely look,<BR>
Which had on many like Rogero wrought;<BR>
But now the ring interpreted the book,<BR>
Which secrets, hid for many ages, taught.<BR>
No wonder then that he the dame forsook,<BR>
And banished from his mind all further thought<BR>
Of love for false Alcina, found in guise<BR>
Which no new means of slippery fraud supplies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
But, as Melissa counselled him, he wore<BR>
His wonted semblance for a time, till he<BR>
Was with his armour, many days before<BR>
Laid by, again accoutred cap-a-pee.<BR>
And, lest Alcina should his end explore,<BR>
Feigned to make proof of his agility;<BR>
Feigned to make proof if for his arms he were<BR>
Too gross, long time unwont the mail to bear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Next Balisarda to his flank he tied<BR>
(For so Rogero&#8217;s trenchant sword was hight),<BR>
And took the wondrous buckler, which, espied,<BR>
Not only dazzled the beholder&#8217;s sight,<BR>
But seemed, when its silk veil was drawn aside,<BR>
As from the body if exhaled the sprite:<BR>
In its close cover of red sendal hung,<BR>
This at his neck the youthful warrior slung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Provided thus, he to the stables came,<BR>
And bade with bridle and with saddle dight<BR>
A horse more black than pitch; for so the dame<BR>
Counselled, well-taught how swift the steed and light.<BR>
Him Rabicano those who know him name,<BR>
And he the courser was, that with the knight,<BR>
Who stands beside the sea, the breeze&#8217;s sport,<BR>
The whale of yore conducted to that port.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
The hippogryph he might have had at need,<BR>
Who next below good Rabican was tied,<BR>
But that the dame had cried to him, &#8220;Take heed,<BR>
Thou know&#8217;st how ill that courser is to ride;&#8221;<BR>
And said the following day the winged steed<BR>
&#8217;Twas her intention from that realm to guide,<BR>
Where he should be instructed at his leisure,<BR>
To rein and run him every where at pleasure:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Nor, if he took him not, would he suggest<BR>
Suspicion of the intended flight: The peer<BR>
This while performed Melissa&#8217;s every hest,<BR>
Who, still invisible, was at his ear.<BR>
So feigning, from the wanton dome possessed<BR>
By that old strumpet, rode the cavalier;<BR>
And pricking forth drew near unto a gate,<BR>
Whence the road led to Logistilla&#8217;s state.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Assaulting suddenly the guardian crew,<BR>
He, sword in hand, the squadron set upon;<BR>
This one he wounded, and that other slew,<BR>
And, point by point made good, the drawbridge won:<BR>
And ere of his escape Alcina knew,<BR>
The gentle youth was far away and gone.<BR>
My next shall tell his route, and how he gained<BR>
At last the realm where Logistilla reigned.</TD></TR>
