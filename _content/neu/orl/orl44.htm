<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Rinaldo his sister to the Child hath plight,<BR>
And to Marseilles is with the warrior gone:<BR>
And having crimsoned wide the field in fight,<BR>
Therein arrives King Otho&#8217;s valiant son.<BR>
To Paris thence: where to that squadron bright<BR>
Is mighty grace and wonderous honour done.<BR>
The Child departs, resolved on Leo&#8217;s slaughter,<BR>
To whom Duke Aymon had betrothed his daughter.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
In poor abode, mid paltry walls and bare,<BR>
Amid discomforts and calamities,<BR>
Often in friendship heart united are,<BR>
Better than under roof of lordly guise,<BR>
Or in some royal court, beset with snare,<BR>
Mid envious wealth, and ease, and luxuries;<BR>
Where charity is spent on every side,<BR>
Nor friendship, unless counterfeit, is spied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Hence it ensues that peace and pact between<BR>
Princes and peers are of such short-lived wear.<BR>
To-day king, pope, and emperor leagued are seen,<BR>
And on the marrow deadly foemen are.<BR>
Because such is not as their outward mien<BR>
The heart, the spirit, that those sovereigns bear.<BR>
Since, wholly careless as to right or wrong,<BR>
But to their profit look the faithless throng.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Though little prone to friendship is that sort,<BR>
Because with those she loveth not to dwell,<BR>
Who, be their talk in earnest or in sport, <BR>
Speak not, except some cozening tale to tell;<BR>
Yet if together in some poor resort<BR>
They prisoned are by Fortune false and fell,<BR>
What friendship is they speedily discern;<BR>
Though years had past, and this was yet to learn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
In his retreat that ancient eremite<BR>
Could bind his inmates with a faster noose,<BR>
And in true love more firmly them unite,<BR>
Than other could in domes where courtiers use;<BR>
And so enduring was the knot and tight,<BR>
That nothing short of death the tie could loose.<BR>
Benignant all the hermit found that crew;<BR>
Whiter at heart than swans in outward hue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
All kind he found them, and of courteous lore;<BR>
Untainted with iniquity, in wise<BR>
Of them I painted, and who nevermore<BR>
Go forth, unless concealed in some disguise.<BR>
Of injuries among them done before<BR>
All memory, by those comrades buried lies:<BR>
Nor could they better love, if from one womb<BR>
And from one seed that warlike band had come.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo more than all that lordly train<BR>
Rogero graced and lovingly caressed;<BR>
As well because be on the listed plain<BR>
Had proved the peer so strong in martial gest,<BR>
As that he was more courteous and humane<BR>
Than any knight that e&#8217;er laid lance in rest:<BR>
But much more; that to him on many a ground<BR>
By mighty obligation was he bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
The fearful risk by Richardetto run<BR>
He knew, and how Rogero him bested;<BR>
What time the Spanish monarch&#8217;s hest was done,<BR>
And with his daughter he was seized in bed;<BR>
And how he had delivered either son<BR>
Of good Duke Buovo (as erewhile was said)<BR>
From Bertolagi of Maganza&#8217;s hand,<BR>
His evil followers, and the paynim band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
To honour and to hold Rogero dear,<BR>
Him, Sir Rinaldo thought, this debt constrained;<BR>
And that he could not so have done whilere,<BR>
The warlike lord was sorely grieved and pained;<BR>
When one for Africk&#8217;s monarch couched the spear,<BR>
And one the cause of royal Charles maintained:<BR>
Now he Rogero for a Christian knew,<BR>
What could not then be done he now would do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Welcome, with endless proffers, on his side,<BR>
And honour he to good Rogero paid.<BR>
The prudent sire that in such kindness spied<BR>
An opening made for more, the pass assayed:<BR>
&#8220;And nothing else remains,&#8221; that hermit cried,<BR>
&#8220;Nor will, I trust, my counsel be gainsaid)<BR>
But that, conjoined by friendship, you shall be<BR>
Yet faster coupled by affinity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That from the two bright progenies, which none<BR>
Will equal in illustrious blood below,<BR>
A race may spring, that brighter than the sun<BR>
Will shine, wherever that bright sun may glow;<BR>
And which, when years and ages will have run<BR>
Their course, will yet endure and fairer show,<BR>
While in their orbits burn the heavenly fires:<BR>
So me, for your instruction, God inspires.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
And his discourse pursuing still, the seer<BR>
So spake, he moves Rinaldo by his rede<BR>
To give his sister to the cavalier;<BR>
Albeit with either small entreaties need.<BR>
Together with Orlando, Olivier<BR>
The counsel lauds, and would that union speed:<BR>
King Charles and Aymon will, he hopes, approve,<BR>
And France will welcome wide their wedded love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
So spake together peer and paladine:<BR>
Nor knew that Aymon, with King Charles&#8217; consent,<BR>
Unto the Grecian emperor Constantine<BR>
To give his gentle daughter had intent;<BR>
Who for young Leo, of his lofty line<BR>
The heir and hope, to crave the maid had sent.<BR>
Such warmth the praises of her worth inspired,<BR>
With love of her unseen was Leo fired.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
To him hath Aymon answered: he, alone,<BR>
Cannot conclude thereon in other sort,<BR>
Until he first hath spoken with his son,<BR>
Rinaldo, absent then from Charles&#8217;s court;<BR>
Who with winged haste, he deems, will thither run,<BR>
And joy in kinsman of such high report;<BR>
But from the high regard he bears his heir,<BR>
Can nought resolve till thither he repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Now good Rinaldo, of his father wide,<BR>
And of the imperial practice knowing nought,<BR>
Promised his beauteous sister as a bride,<BR>
Upon his own, as well as Roland&#8217;s thought<BR>
And the others, harboured in that cell beside;<BR>
But most of all on him the hermit wrought;<BR>
And by such marriage, &#8217;twas the peer&#8217;s belief,<BR>
He could not choose but pleasure Clermont&#8217;s chief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
That day and night, and of the following day<BR>
Great part, with that sage monk the warriors spent;<BR>
Scarce mindful that the crew their coming stay,<BR>
Albeit the wind blew fair for their intent,<BR>
But these, impatient at their long delay,<BR>
More than one message to the warriors sent;<BR>
And to return those barons urged so sore,<BR>
Parforce they parted from the hermit hoar.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
The Child who, so long banished, had not stayed<BR>
From the lone rock, whereon the waters roared,<BR>
His farewell to that holy master made,<BR>
Who taught him the true faith: anew with sword<BR>
Orlando girt his side, and with the blade,<BR>
Frontino and martial Hector&#8217;s arms restored;<BR>
As knowing horse and arms were his whilere,<BR>
As well as out of kindness to the peer;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
And, though the enchanted sword with better right<BR>
Would have been worn by good Anglantes&#8217; chief,<BR>
Who from the fearful garden by his might<BR>
Had won the blade with mickle toil and grief,<BR>
Than by Rogero, who that faulchion bright<BR>
Received with good Frontino, from the thief,<BR>
He willingly thereof, as with the rest,<BR>
As soon as asked, the warrior repossest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The hermit blessings on the band implores:<BR>
They to their bark in fine return; their sails<BR>
Give to the winds, and to the waves their oars;<BR>
And such clear skies they have and gentle gales,<BR>
Nor vow nor prayer the patron makes; and moors<BR>
His pinnace in the haven of Marseilles.<BR>
There, safely harboured, let the chiefs remain,<BR>
Till I conduct Astolpho to that train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
When of that bloody, dear-brought victory<BR>
The scarcely joyful tale Astolpho knew,<BR>
He, seeing evermore fair France would be<BR>
Secure from mischief from the Moorish crew,<BR>
Homeward to send the king of Aethiopy<BR>
Devised, together with his army, through<BR>
The sandy desert, by the self-same track,<BR>
Through which he led them to Biserta&#8217;s sack.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Erewhile restored, in Afric waters ride<BR>
Sir Dudon&#8217;s ships which did the paynims rout;<BR>
Whose prows (new miracle!) and poop, and side,<BR>
As soon as all their sable crews are out,<BR>
Are changed anew to leaves; which far and wide,<BR>
Raised by a sudden breeze, are blown about;<BR>
And scattered in mid-air, like such light gear,<BR>
Go eddying with the wind, and disappear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Home, horse and foot, the Nubian host arraid<BR>
By squadrons, all, from wasted Africk go;<BR>
But to their king, first, thanks Astolpho paid,<BR>
And said, he an eternal debt should owe;<BR>
In that he had in person given him aid<BR>
With all his might and main against the foe.<BR>
The skins Astolpho gave them, which confined<BR>
The turbid and tempestuous southern wind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
I say, enclosed in skins that wind he gave,<BR>
Which in such fury blows at noon, on high<BR>
I moves the shifting plain in many a wave,<BR>
And fills the eddying sand the troubled sky,<BR>
To carry with them, and from scathe to save<BR>
Their squadrons, lest the dusty whirlwind fly;<BR>
And bids them, when arrived at home, unnoose<BR>
The bladder&#8217;s vent, and let their prisoners loose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
When they have lofty Atlas passes won,<BR>
The horses that the Nubian riders bear,<BR>
Turpin relates, are changed at once to stone;<BR>
So that the steeds return to what they were.<BR>
But it is time the Duke to France was gone;<BR>
Who having thus provided, in his care,<BR>
For the main places in the Moorish land,<BR>
Made the hippogryph anew his wings expand;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
He reached Sardinia at one flight and shear,<BR>
Corsica from Sardinia; and then o&#8217;er<BR>
The foaming sea his venturous course did steer,<BR>
Inclining somewhat left the griffin&#8217;s soar.<BR>
In the sea-marshes last his light career<BR>
He stopt, on rich Provence&#8217;s pleasant shore:<BR>
Where to the hyppogryph by him is done<BR>
What was erewhile enjoined by sainted John.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
To him the charge did sainted John commit,<BR>
When to Provence by that winged courser borne,<BR>
Him nevermore with saddle or with bit<BR>
To gall, but let him to his lair return.<BR>
Already had the planet, whither flit<BR>
Things lost on earth, of sound deprived his horn:<BR>
For this not only hoarse but mute remained,<BR>
As soon as the holy place Astolpho gained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Thence to Marseilles he came; and came the day<BR>
Orlando, and Rinaldo, and Olivier<BR>
Arrived therein, upon their homeward way,<BR>
With good Sobrino, and the better peer,<BR>
Rogero: not so triumphs that array,<BR>
Touched by the death of him, their comrade dear,<BR>
As they for such a glorious victory won<BR>
&#8212;But for that sad disaster&#8212;would have done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Of the kings slain upon the paynim part,<BR>
The news from Sicily to Charles were blown,<BR>
Sobrino&#8217;s fate, and death of Brandimart;<BR>
Nor less of good Rogero had been shown.<BR>
Charles stood with jocund fate and gladsome heart,<BR>
Rejoicing he had from his shoulders thrown<BR>
The intolerable load whereof the weight<BR>
Will for long time prevent his standing straight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
To honour those fair pillars that sustain<BR>
The state&#8212;the holy empire&#8217;s corner-stone&#8212;<BR>
The nobles of his kingdom Charlemagne<BR>
Dispatched, to meet the knights, as far as Saone;<BR>
And from his city with his worthiest train,<BR>
King, duke, and her, the partner of his throne,<BR>
Issued amid a fair and gorgeous band<BR>
Of noble damsels, upon either hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
The emperor Charles with bright and cheerful brow,<BR>
Lords, paladins and people, kinsmen, friends,<BR>
Fair love to Roland and the others show.<BR>
Mongrana and Clermont&#8217;s cry the welkin rends.<BR>
No sooner, mid that kind and festal show,<BR>
The interchange of fond embracements ends,<BR>
Than Roland and his friends Rogero bring,<BR>
And mid those lords present him to the king;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
And him Rogero of Risa&#8217;s son declare,<BR>
And vouch in valour as his father&#8217;s peer,<BR>
&#8220;Witnesses of his worth our squadrons are,<BR>
They best can tell his prowess with the spear.&#8221;<BR>
Meanwhile, the noble and the lovely pair,<BR>
Marphisa and gentle Bradamant appear.<BR>
This runs to fold Rogero to her heart;<BR>
More coy, that other stands somedeal apart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
The emperor bids Rogero mount again,<BR>
Who from his horse had lit, in reverence due;<BR>
And, side by side, with him his courser rein;<BR>
Nor aught omits that monarch which may do<BR>
The warrior honour, mid his martial train:<BR>
How the true faith he had embraced he knew;<BR>
Of all instructed by that band before;<BR>
When first those paladins set foot ashore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
With pomp triumphal and with festive cheer<BR>
The troop returns within the city-walls:<BR>
With leaves and garlands green the streets appear,<BR>
And tapestried all about with gorgeous palls.<BR>
Of herbs and flowers a mingled rain, where&#8217;er<BR>
They wend, upon the conquering squadron falls,<BR>
Which with full hands from stand and window throw<BR>
Damsel and dame upon the knights below. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
At every turn, in various places are,<BR>
Of sudden structure arch and trophy high,<BR>
Whereon Biserta&#8217;s sack is painted fair,<BR>
Ruin and fire, and feat of chivalry:<BR>
Scaffolds, upraised for different sports elsewhere<BR>
And merrimake and stage-play meet the eye;<BR>
And, writ with truth, above, below, between,<BR>
To THE EMPIRE&#8217;S SAVIOURS, everywhere is seen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
With sound of shrilling pipe and trumpet proud,<BR>
And other festive music, laughter light,<BR>
Applause and favour of the following crowd,<BR>
Which scarce found room, begirt with dames and knight,<BR>
The mighty emperor, mid those greetings loud.<BR>
Before the royal palace did alight:<BR>
Where many days he feasted high in hall<BR>
His lords, mid tourney, mummery, mask and ball.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
His son to Aymon on a day made known<BR>
His sister he would make Rogero&#8217;s bride;<BR>
And, before Olivier and Milo&#8217;s son,<BR>
Her to the Child by promise had affied;<BR>
Who think with him that kindred is there none<BR>
Wherewith to league themselves, on any side,<BR>
For valour or nobility of blood,<BR>
Better than his; nay, none so passing good.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Duke Aymon heard his heir with some disdain;<BR>
That, without concert with him, and alone<BR>
He dared to plight his daughter, whom he fain<BR>
Would marry to the Grecian emperor&#8217;s son;<BR>
And not to him that has no kingly reign,<BR>
Nay has not ought that he can call his own;<BR>
And should not know, how little nobleness<BR>
Is valued without wealth; how virtue less.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
But Beatrice, his wife, with more despite<BR>
Arraigns her son, and calls him arrogant;<BR>
And moves each open way and hidden sleight<BR>
To break Rogero&#8217;s match with Bradamant;<BR>
Resolved to tax her every means and might<BR>
To make her empress of the wide Levant.<BR>
Firm in his purpose is Montalban&#8217;s lord,<BR>
Nor will in ought forego his plighted word.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Beatrice who believes the highminded fair<BR>
Is at her hest, exhorts her to reply,<BR>
Rather than she will be constrained to pair<BR>
With a poor knight, she is resolved to die;<BR>
Nor, if this wrong she from Rinaldo bear<BR>
Will she regard her with a mother&#8217;s eye:<BR>
Let her refuse and keep her stedfast course;<BR>
For her free will Rinaldo cannot force.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Silent stands mournful Bradamant, nor dares<BR>
Meanwhile her lady-mother&#8217;s speech gainsay;<BR>
To whom such reverence, and respect, she bears,<BR>
She thinks no choice is left but to obey.<BR>
Yet a foul fault it in her eyes appears,<BR>
If what she will not do, she falsely say:<BR>
She will not, for she cannot; since above<BR>
All guidance, great or small, is mighty Love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Deny she dared not, nor yet seem content;<BR>
So, sighed and spake not; but&#8212;when uncontrolled<BR>
She could&#8212;she gave her secret sorrow vent,<BR>
While from her eyes the tears like billows rolled;<BR>
A portion of the pains that her torment,<BR>
Inflicting on her breast and locks of gold:<BR>
For this she beat, and those uptore and brake;<BR>
And thus she made lament, and thus she spake.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! shall I will what she wills not, by right<BR>
More sovereign mistress of my will than I?<BR>
Hers shall I hold so cheaply, so to slight<BR>
A mother&#8217;s will, my own to satisfy?<BR>
Alas! what blemish is so foul to sight<BR>
In damsel? What so ill, as to affy<BR>
Myself to husband, reckless of her will,<BR>
Which &#8217;tis my duty ever to fulfil?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Wo worth the while! and shall I then to thee<BR>
By filial love be forced to be untrue,<BR>
O my Rogero, and surrender me<BR>
To a new hope, a new love, and a new<BR>
Desire; or rather from those ties break free,<BR>
From all good children to good parents due;<BR>
Observance, reverence cast aside; and measure<BR>
My duty by my happiness, my pleasure?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I know, alas! what I should do; I know<BR>
That which a duteous daughter doth behove;<BR>
I know; but what avails it, if not so<BR>
My reason moves me as my senses move;<BR>
If she retires before a stronger foe;<BR>
Nor can I of myself dispose, for Love;<BR>
Nor think how to dispose; so strict his sway;<BR>
Nor, saving as he dictates, do and say?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Aymon and Beatrice&#8217;s child, the slave<BR>
Of Love am I; ah! miserable me!<BR>
I from my parents am in hope to have<BR>
Pardon and pity, if in fault I be:<BR>
But, if I anger Love, whose prayer shall save<BR>
Me from his fury, till one only plea,<BR>
Of mine the Godhead shall vouchsafe to hear;<BR>
Nor doom me dead as soon as I appear?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alas! with long and obstinate pursuit,<BR>
To our faith to draw Rogero have I wrought;<BR>
And finally have drawn; but with what boot,<BR>
If my fair deed for other&#8217;s good be wrought?<BR>
So yearly by the bee, whose labour&#8217;s fruit<BR>
Is lost for her, is hive with honey fraught.<BR>
But I will die ere I the Child forsake,<BR>
And other husband than Rogero take.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If I shall not obey my father&#8217;s hest,<BR>
Nor mothers, I my brother&#8217;s shall obey,<BR>
Of greater wisdom far than them possest;<BR>
Nor Time hath made that warrior&#8217;s wit his prey;<BR>
And what he wills by Roland is profest;<BR>
And, one and the other, on my side are they;<BR>
A pair more feared and honoured far and wide<BR>
Than all the members of my house beside.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If them the flower of Clermont&#8217;s noble tree,<BR>
The glory and the splendor all account;<BR>
If all believe our other chivalry<BR>
They, more than head o&#8217;ertops the foot, surmount;<BR>
Why would I Aymon should dispose of me,<BR>
Rather than good Rinaldo and the Count?<BR>
I should not; so much less, as not affied<BR>
To Leo, and Rogero&#8217;s promised bride.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
If cruel thoughts the afflicted maid torment,<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s mind enjoys not more repose;<BR>
For albeit those sad tidings have not vent<BR>
Yet in the city, he the secret knows.<BR>
He o&#8217;er his humble fortunes makes lament<BR>
Which his enjoying such a good oppose;<BR>
As unendowed with riches or with reign,<BR>
Dispensed so widely to a worthless train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Of other goods which Nature&#8217;s hand supplies,<BR>
Or which acquired by man&#8217;s own study are,<BR>
He such a portion in himself espies,<BR>
Such and so large was never other&#8217;s share:<BR>
In that, no beauty with his beauty vies;<BR>
In that, resistance to his might is rare.<BR>
The palm by none from him can challenged be,<BR>
In regal splendour, magnanimity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
But they at whose disposal honours lie,<BR>
Who give at will, and take away renown;<BR>
The vulgar herd; and from the vulgar I,<BR>
Except the prudent man, distinguished none;<BR>
Nor emperor, pope, nor king, is raised more high<BR>
Than these by sceptre, mitre, or by crown,<BR>
Nor save by prudence; save by judgement, given<BR>
But to the favoured few by partial Heaven;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
This vulgar (to say out what I would say)<BR>
Which only honours wealth, therewith more smit<BR>
Than any worldly thing beside, nor they<BR>
Aught heed or aught esteem, ungraced with it,<BR>
Be beauty or be daring what it may,<BR>
Dexterity or prowess, worth, or wit,<BR>
Or goodness&#8212;yet more vulgar stands confest<BR>
In that whereof I speak than in the rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Rogero said: &#8220;If Aymon is disposed<BR>
An empress in his Bradamant to see,<BR>
Let not his treaty be so quickly closed<BR>
With Leo; let a year be granted me:<BR>
In that, meanwhile, I hope, by me deposed<BR>
Shall Leo with his royal father be,<BR>
And I, encircled with their forfeit crown,<BR>
Shall be for Aymon no unworthy son.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if he give without delay, as said,<BR>
His daughter to the son of Constantine,<BR>
If to that promise no regard be paid,<BR>
Which good Rinaldo and the paladine,<BR>
His cousin, erst before the hermit made,<BR>
The Marquis Olivier and King Sobrine,<BR>
What shall I do? such grievous wrong shall I<BR>
Endure, or, rather than endure it, die?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What shall I do? her father then pursue,<BR>
On whom for vengeance this grave outrage cries?<BR>
I heed not that the deed is hard to do,<BR>
Or if the attempt in me is weak or wise:&#8212;<BR>
But presuppose that, with his kindred crew<BR>
Slain by my hand that unjust elder dies;<BR>
This will in nothing further my content;<BR>
Nay it will wholly frustrate my intent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Twas ever my intent, and still &#8217;tis so<BR>
To have the love, not hatred, of that fair;<BR>
But should I Aymon slay, or bring some woe<BR>
By plot or practice, on his house or heir,<BR>
Will she not justly hold me as her foe,<BR>
And me, that foeman, as her lord forswear?<BR>
What shall I do, endure such injury?<BR>
Ah! no, by Heaven! far rather I will die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nay die I will not; but with better right<BR>
Shall Leo die, who so disturbs my joy;<BR>
He and his unjust sire; less dear his flight<BR>
With Helen paid her paramour of Troy;<BR>
Nor yet in older time that foul despite,<BR>
Done to Proserpina, cost such annoy<BR>
To bold Pirithous, as for her I&#8217;ve lost<BR>
My grief of heart shall son and father cost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Can it be true, my life, that to forsake<BR>
Thy champion for this Greek should grieve not thee?<BR>
And could thy father force thee him to take,<BR>
Though joined thy brethren with thy sire should be?<BR>
But &#8217;tis my fear that thou would&#8217;st rather make<BR>
Accord withal with Aymon than with me;<BR>
And that it seemeth better in thy sight<BR>
To wed with Caesar than with simple wight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Can it be true that royal name should blind,<BR>
Imperial title, pomp and majesty,<BR>
And taint my Bradamant&#8217;s egregious mind,<BR>
Her mighty valour and her virtue high,<BR>
So that, as cheaper, she should cast behind<BR>
Her plighted faith, and from her promise fly?<BR>
Nor sooner she a foe to Love be made,<BR>
Than she no longer say, what once she said?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
These things Rogero said, and more beside,<BR>
Discoursing with himself, and in such strain<BR>
Oftentimes the afflicted warrior cried,<BR>
That stander-by o&#8217;erheard the knight complain,<BR>
And more than once his grief was signified<BR>
To her that was the occasion of his pain;<BR>
Who no less for his cruel woe, when known,<BR>
Lamented than for sorrows of her own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
But most, of all the sorrows that were said<BR>
To vex Rogero, most it works her woe<BR>
To hear that he afflicts himself, in dread<BR>
Lest for the Grecian prince she him forego.<BR>
Hence this belief, this error, from his head<BR>
To drive, comfort on the knight bestow,<BR>
The trustiest of her bower-women, one day,<BR>
She to Rogero bade these words convey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Rogero, I what I was till death will be;<BR>
And be more faithful, if I can be more:<BR>
Deals Love in kindness or in scorn with me;<BR>
Hath doubtful Fortune good or ill in store;<BR>
I am a very rock of faith, by sea<BR>
And winds unmoved, which round about it roar<BR>
Nor I have changed for calm or storm, nor I<BR>
Will ever change to all eternity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sooner shall file or chisel made of lead<BR>
To the rough diamond various forms impart,<BR>
Than any stroke, by fickle Fortune sped,<BR>
Or Love&#8217;s keen anger, break my constant heart:<BR>
Sooner return, to Alp, their fountain-head,<BR>
The troubled streams that from its summit part,<BR>
Than e&#8217;er, for change or chances, good or nought,<BR>
Shall wander from its way my stedfast thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;All power o&#8217;er me have I bestowed on you,<BR>
Rogero; and more than others may divine:<BR>
I know that to a prince whose throne is new<BR>
Was never fealty sworn more true than mine;<BR>
Nor ever surer state, this wide world through,<BR>
By king or keysar was possest than thine.<BR>
Thou need&#8217;st not dig a ditch nor build a tower,<BR>
In fear lest any rob thee of that power.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For if thou hire no aids, assault is none,<BR>
But what thereon shall aye be made in vain;<BR>
Nor shall it be by any riches won:<BR>
So vile a price no gentle heart can gain:<BR>
Nor by nobility, nor kingly crown,<BR>
That dazzle so the silly vulgar train;<BR>
Nor beauty, puissant with the weak and light,<BR>
Shall ever make me thee for other slight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou hast no cause, amid thy griefs, to fear<BR>
My heart should ever bear new impress more:<BR>
So deeply is thine image graven here,<BR>
It cannot be removed: that my heart&#8217;s core<BR>
Is not of wax is proved; for Love whilere<BR>
Smote it a hundred times, not once, before<BR>
He by his blows a single scale displaced,<BR>
What time therein his hand thine image traced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ivory, gem, and every hard-grained stone<BR>
That best resists the griding tool, may break:<BR>
But, save the form it once hath taken, none<BR>
Will ever from the graver&#8217;s iron take.<BR>
My heart like marble is, or thing least prone<BR>
Beneath the chisel&#8217;s trenchant edge to flake:<BR>
Love this may wholly splinter, ere he may<BR>
Another&#8217;s beauty in its core enlay.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Other and many words with comfort rife,<BR>
And full of love and faith, she said beside;<BR>
Which might a thousand times have given him life,<BR>
Albeit a thousand times the knight had died:<BR>
But, when most clear of the tempestuous strife,<BR>
In friendly port these hopes appeared to ride,<BR>
These hopes a foul and furious wind anew<BR>
Far from the sheltering land to seaward blew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
In that the gentle Bradamant, who fain<BR>
Would do far more than she hath signified,<BR>
With wonted daring armed her heart again;<BR>
And boldly casting all respect aside,<BR>
One day stood up before King Charlemagne;<BR>
And, &#8220;Sire, if ever yet,&#8221; the damsel cried,<BR>
&#8220;I have found favour in your eyes for deed<BR>
Done heretofore, deny me not its meed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And I entreat, before I claim my fee,<BR>
That you to me your royal promise plight,<BR>
To grant my prayer; and fain would have you see<BR>
That what I shall demand is just and right.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;Thy valour, damsel dear, deserves from me<BR>
The boon wherewith thy worth I should requite&#8221;<BR>
(Charles answered), &#8220;and I to content thee swear,<BR>
Though of my kingdom thou should&#8217;st claim a share.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The boon for which I to your highness sue,<BR>
Is not to let my parents me accord<BR>
(Pursued the martial damsel) save he shew<BR>
More prowess than myself, to any lord.<BR>
Let him contend with me in tourney, who<BR>
Would have me, or assay me with the sword.<BR>
Me as his wife let him that wins me, wear;<BR>
Let him that loses me, with other pair.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
With cheerful face the emperor made reply,<BR>
The entreaty was well worthy of the maid;<BR>
And that with tranquil mind she might rely,<BR>
He would accord the boon for which she prayed.<BR>
This audience was not given so secretly,<BR>
But that the news to others were conveyed;<BR>
Which on that very day withal were told<BR>
In the ears of Beatrice and Aymon old;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Who against Bradamant with fury flame,<BR>
And both alike, with sudden anger fraught,<BR>
(For plainly they perceive, that in her claim<BR>
She for Rogero more than Leo wrought)<BR>
And active to prevent the damsel&#8217;s aim<BR>
From being to a safe conclusion brought,<BR>
Privily take her from King Charles&#8217;s court,<BR>
And thence to Rocca Forte&#8217;s tower transport.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
A castle this, which royal Charlemagne<BR>
Had given to Aymon some few days before,<BR>
Built between Carcasson and Perpignan,<BR>
On a commanding point upon the shore.<BR>
Resolved to send her eastward, there the twain<BR>
As in a prison kept her evermore.<BR>
Willing or nilling, so must she forsake<BR>
Rogero, and for lord must Leo take.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
The martial maid of no less modest vein<BR>
Than bold and full of fire before the foe,<BR>
Albeit no guard on her the castellain<BR>
Hath set, and she is free to come or go,<BR>
Observant of her sire, obeys the rein:<BR>
Yet prison, death, and every pain and woe<BR>
To suffer is resolved that constant maid<BR>
Before by her Rogero be betrayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo, who thus ravished from his hand,<BR>
By ancient Aymon&#8217;s craft his sister spied,<BR>
And saw he could no more in wedlock&#8217;s band<BR>
Dispose of her, by him in vain affied,<BR>
Of his old sire complains, and him doth brand,<BR>
Laying his filial love and fear aside:<BR>
But little him Rinaldo&#8217;s words molest;<BR>
Who by the maid will do as likes him best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Rogero, bearing this and sore afraid<BR>
That he shall lose his bride; and Leo take,<BR>
If left alive, by force or love the maid,<BR>
Resolved within himself (but nothing spake)<BR>
Constantine&#8217;s heir should perish by his blade;<BR>
And of Augustus him a god would make.<BR>
He, save his hope deceived him and was vain,<BR>
Would sire and son deprive of life and reign.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
His limbs in arms, which Trojan Hector&#8217;s were,<BR>
And afterwards the Tartar king&#8217;s, he steeled;<BR>
Bade rein Frontino, and his wonted wear<BR>
Exchanged, crest, surcoat and emblazoned shield.<BR>
On that emprize it pleased him not to bear<BR>
His argent eagle on its azure field.<BR>
White as a lily, was a unicorn<BR>
By him upon a field of crimson worn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
He chose from his attendant squires the best,<BR>
And willed none else should him accompany;<BR>
And gave him charge, that ne&#8217;er by him exprest<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s name in any place should be;<BR>
Crost Meuse and Rhine, and pricked upon his quest<BR>
Through the Austrian countries into Hungary;<BR>
Along the right bank of the Danube made,<BR>
And rode an-end until he reached Belgrade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Where Save into dark Danube makes descent,<BR>
And to the sea, increased by him, doth flow,<BR>
He saw the imperial ensigns spread, and tent<BR>
And white pavilion, thronged with troops below.<BR>
For Constantine to have that town was bent<BR>
Anew, late won by the Bulgarian foe.<BR>
In person, with his son, is Constantine,<BR>
With all the empire&#8217;s force his host to line.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Within Belgrade, and through the neighbouring peak,<BR>
Even to its bottom which the waters lave,<BR>
The Bulgar fronts him; and both armies seek<BR>
A watering-place in the intermediate Save.<BR>
A bridge across that rapid stream the Greek<BR>
Would fling; the Bulgar would defend the wave;<BR>
When thither came Rogero; and engaged<BR>
Beheld the hosts in fight, which hotly raged.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
The Greeks in that affray were four to one,<BR>
And with pontoons to bridge the stream supplied;<BR>
And a bold semblance through their host put on<BR>
Of crossing to the river&#8217;s further side.<BR>
Leo meanwhile was from the river gone<BR>
With covert guile; he took a circuit wide,<BR>
Then thither made return; his bridges placed<BR>
From bank to bank, and past the stream in haste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
With many horse and foot in battle dight,<BR>
Who nothing under twenty thousand rank,<BR>
Along the river rode the Grecian knight;<BR>
And fiercely charged his enemies in flank.<BR>
The emperor, when his son appeared in sight.<BR>
Leading his squadrons on the farther bank,<BR>
Uniting bridge and bark together, crost<BR>
Upon his part the stream with all his host.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
King Vatran, chief of the Bulgarian band,<BR>
Wise, bold, withal a warrior, here and there<BR>
Laboured in vain such onset to withstand,<BR>
And the disorder of his host repair;<BR>
When Leo prest him sore, and with strong hand<BR>
The king to earth beneath his courser bare;<BR>
Whom at the prince&#8217;s hest, for all to fierce<BR>
Is he to yield, a thousand faulchions pierce.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
The Bulgar host hath hitherto made head;<BR>
But when they see their sovereign is laid low,<BR>
And everywhere that tempest wax and spread,<BR>
They turn their backs where erst they faced the foe.<BR>
The Child, who mid the Greeks, from whom they fled,<BR>
Was borne along, beheld that overthrow,<BR>
And bowned himself their battle to restore,<BR>
As hating Constantine and Leo more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
He spurs Frontino, that in his career<BR>
Is like the wind, and passes every steed;<BR>
He overtakes the troop, that in their fear<BR>
Fly to the mountain and desert the mead.<BR>
Many he stops and turns; then rests his spear;<BR>
And, as he puts his courser to his speed,<BR>
So fearful is his look, even Mars and Jove<BR>
Are frighted in their azure realms above.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Advanced before the others, he descried<BR>
A cavalier, in crimson vest, whereon<BR>
With all its stalk in silk and gold was spied<BR>
A pod, like millet, in embroidery done:<BR>
Constantine&#8217;s nephew, by the sister&#8217;s side,<BR>
He was, but was no less beloved than son:<BR>
He split like glass his shield and scaly rind;<BR>
And the long lance appeared a palm behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
He left the dead, and drew his shining blade<BR>
Upon a squadron, whom he saw most nigh;<BR>
And now at once, and now at other made;<BR>
Cleft bodies, and made hearts from shoulders fly.<BR>
At throat, at breast and flank the warrior laid;<BR>
Smote hand, and arm, and shoulder, bust, and thigh;<BR>
And through that champaign ran the reeking blood,<BR>
As to the valley foams the mountain-flood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
None that behold those strokes maintain their place;<BR>
So are they all bewildered by their fear.<BR>
Thus suddenly the battle changed its face:<BR>
For, catching courage from the cavalier,<BR>
The Bulgar squadrons rally, turn, and chase<BR>
The Grecian troops that fled from them whilere.<BR>
Lost was all order in a thought, and they<BR>
With all their banners fled in disarray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Leo Augustus on a swelling height,<BR>
Seeing his followers fly, hath taken post;<BR>
Where woeful and bewildered (for to sight<BR>
Nothing in all the country round is lost)<BR>
He from his lofty station eyes the knight,<BR>
Who with his single arm destroys that host;<BR>
And cannot choose, though so his prowess harms,<BR>
But praise that peer and own his worth in arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
He knew full well by ensignry displaid,<BR>
By surcoat and by gilded panoply,<BR>
That albeit to the foe he furnished aid,<BR>
That champion was not of his chivalry;<BR>
Wondering his superhuman deeds surveyed;<BR>
And now an angel seemed in him to see,<BR>
To scourge the Greeks from quires above descended,<BR>
Whose sins so oft and oft had heaven offended;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
And, as a man of great and noble heart,<BR>
(Where many others would have hatred sworn)<BR>
Enamoured of such valour, on his part,<BR>
Would not desire to see him suffer scorn:<BR>
For one that died, six Grecians&#8217; death less smart<BR>
Would cause that prince; and better had he borne<BR>
To lose as well a portion of his reign,<BR>
Than to behold so good a warrior slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
As baby, albeit its fond mother beat<BR>
And drive it forth in anger, in its fear<BR>
Neither to sire nor sister makes retreat;<BR>
But to her arms returns with fondling cheer:<BR>
So Leo, though Rogero in his heat<BR>
Slaughters his routed van and threats his rear,<BR>
Cannot that champion hate; because above<BR>
His anger is the admiring prince&#8217;s love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
But if young Leo loved him and admired,<BR>
Meseems that he an ill exchange hath made;<BR>
For him Rogero loathed; nor aught desired<BR>
More than to lay him lifeless with his blade:<BR>
Him with his eyes he sought; for him inquired;<BR>
But Leo&#8217;s fortune his desire gainsayed;<BR>
Which with the prudence of the practised Greek,<BR>
Made him in vain his hated rival seek.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Leo, for fear his bands be wholly spent,<BR>
Bids sound the assembly his Greek squadrons through:<BR>
He to his father a quick courier sent,<BR>
To pray that he would pass the stream anew;<BR>
Who, if the way was open, well content<BR>
Might with his bargain he; and with a few<BR>
Whom he collects, the Grecian cavalier<BR>
Recrost the bridge by which he past whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Into the power o&#8217; the Bulgars many fall,<BR>
Stalin from the hill-top to the river-side;<BR>
And they into their hands had fallen all,<BR>
But for the river&#8217;s intervening tide.<BR>
From the bridge many drop, and drown withal;<BR>
And many that ne&#8217;er turned their heads aside,<BR>
Thence to a distant ford for safety made;<BR>
And many were dragged prisoners to Belgrade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
When done was that day&#8217;s fight, wherein (since borne<BR>
To ground the Bulgar king his life did yield)<BR>
His squadrons would have suffered scathe and scorn,<BR>
Had not for them the warrior won the field,<BR>
The warrior, that the snowy unicorn<BR>
Wore for his blazon on a crimson shield,<BR>
To him all flock, in him with joy and glee<BR>
The winner of that glorious battle see.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Some bow and some salute him; of the rest<BR>
Some kist the warrior&#8217;s feet, and some his hand.<BR>
Round him as closely as they could they prest,<BR>
And happy those are deemed, that nearest stand;<BR>
More those that touch him; for to touch a blest<BR>
And supernatural thing believes the band.<BR>
On him with shouts that rent the heavens they cried,<BR>
To be their king, their captain, and their guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
As king or captain them will he command<BR>
As liked them best, he said, but will not lay<BR>
On sceptre or on leading-staff his hand;<BR>
Nor yet Belgrade will enter on that day:<BR>
For first, ere farther flies young Leo&#8217;s band,<BR>
And they across the river make their way,<BR>
Him will he follow, nor forego, until<BR>
That Grecian leader he o&#8217;ertake and kill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
A thousand miles and more for this alone<BR>
He thither measured, and for nought beside.<BR>
He saith; and from the multitude is gone,<BR>
And by a road that&#8217;s shown to him doth ride.<BR>
For towards the bridge is royal Leo flown;<BR>
Haply lest him from this the foe divide:<BR>
Behind him pricks Rogero with such fire,<BR>
The warrior calls not, nor awaits, his squire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Such vantage Leo has in flight (to flee<BR>
He rather may be said than to retreat)<BR>
The passage open hath he found and free;<BR>
And then destroys the bridge and burns his fleet.<BR>
Rogero arrived not, till beneath the sea<BR>
The sun was hid; nor lodging found; his beat<BR>
He still pursued; and now shone forth the moon:<BR>
But town or village found the warrior none.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Because he wots not where to lodge, he goes<BR>
All night, nor from his load Frontino frees.<BR>
When the new sun his early radiance shows,<BR>
A city to the left Rogero sees;<BR>
And there all day determines to repose,<BR>
As where he may his wearied courser ease,<BR>
Whom he so far that livelong night had pressed;<BR>
Nor had he drawn his bit, nor given him rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
Ungiardo had that city in his guard,<BR>
Constantine&#8217;s liegeman, and to him right dear;<BR>
Who, since upon the Bulgars he had warred,<BR>
Much horse and foot had sent that emperor; here<BR>
Now entered (for the entrance was not barred)<BR>
Rogero, and found such hospitable cheer,<BR>
He to fare further had no need, in trace<BR>
Of better or of more abundant place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
In the same hostelry with him a guest<BR>
Was lodged that evening a Romanian knight;<BR>
Present what time the Child with lance in rest<BR>
Succoured the Bulgars in that cruel fight;<BR>
Who hardly had escaped his hand, sore prest<BR>
And scared as never yet was living wight;<BR>
So that he trembled still, disturbed in mind,<BR>
And deemed the knight of the unicorn behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
He by the buckler knew as soon as spied<BR>
The cavalier, whose arms that blazon bear,<BR>
For him that routed the Byzantine side;<BR>
By hand of whom so many slaughtered were.<BR>
He hurried to the palace, and applied<BR>
For audience, weighty tidings to declare;<BR>
And, to Ungiardo led forthwith, rehearsed<BR>
What shall by men in other strain be versed.</TD></TR>
