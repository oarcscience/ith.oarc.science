<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Lament and outcry loud of some that mourn,<BR>
Attract Rogero and the damsels two.<BR>
They find Ulania, with her mantle shorn<BR>
By Marganor, amid her moaning crew.<BR>
Upon that felon knight, for his foul scorn,<BR>
A fierce revenge Marphisa takes: a new<BR>
Statute that maid does in the town obtain,<BR>
And Marganor is by Ulania slain.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
If, as in seeking other gift to gain,<BR>
(For Nature, without study, yieldeth nought)<BR>
With mighty diligence, and mickle pain,<BR>
Illustrious women day and night have wrought;<BR>
And if with good success the female train<BR>
To a fair end no homely task have brought,<BR>
So&#8212;did they for such other studies wake&#8212;<BR>
As mortal attributes immortal make;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
And, if they of themselves sufficient were<BR>
Their praises to posterity to show,<BR>
Nor borrowed authors&#8217; aid, whose bosoms are<BR>
With envy and with hate corroded so,<BR>
That oft they hide the good they might declare,<BR>
And tell in every place what ill they know,<BR>
To such a pitch would mount the female name,<BR>
As haply ne&#8217;er was reached by manly fame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
To furnish mutual aid is not enow,<BR>
For many who would lend each other light.<BR>
Men do their best, that womankind should show<BR>
Whatever faults they have in open sight;<BR>
Would hinder them of rising from below,<BR>
And sink them to the bottom, if they might;<BR>
I say the ancients; as if glory, won<BR>
By woman, dimmed their own, as mist the sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
But hands or tongue ne&#8217;er had, nor has, the skill,<BR>
Does voice or lettered page the thought impart,<BR>
Though each, with all its power, increase the ill,<BR>
Diminishing the good with all its art,<BR>
So female fame to stifle, but that still<BR>
The honour of the sex survives in part:<BR>
Yet reacheth not its pitch, nor such its flight,<BR>
But that &#8217;tis far below its natural height.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Not only Thomyris and Harpalice,<BR>
And who brought Hector, who brought Turnus aid,<BR>
And who, to build in Lybia crost the sea,<BR>
By Tyrian and Sidonian band obeyed;<BR>
Not only famed Zenobia, only she<BR>
Who Persian, Indian, and Assyrian frayed;<BR>
Not only these and some few others merit<BR>
Their glory, that eternal fame inherit:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Faithful, chaste, and bold, the world hath seen<BR>
In Greece and Rome not only, but where&#8217;er<BR>
The Sun unfolds his flowing locks, between<BR>
The Hesperides and Indian hemisphere;<BR>
Whose gifts and praise have so extinguished been,<BR>
We scarce of one amid a thousand hear;<BR>
And this because they in their days have had<BR>
For chroniclers, men envious, false, and bad.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
But ye that prosper in the exercise<BR>
Of goodly labours, aye your way pursue;<BR>
Nor halt, O women, in your high emprise,<BR>
For fear of not receiving honour due:<BR>
For, as nought good endures beneath the skies,<BR>
So ill endures no more; if hitherto<BR>
Unfriendly by the poet&#8217;s pen and page,<BR>
They now befriend you in our better age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Erewhile Marullo and Pontante for you<BR>
Declared, and&#8212;sire and son&#8212;the Strozzi twain;<BR>
Capello, Bembo, and that writer, who<BR>
Has fashioned like himself the courtier train;<BR>
With Lewis Alamanni, and those two,<BR>
Beloved of Mars and Muses, of their strain<BR>
Descended, who the mighty city rule,<BR>
Which Mincius parts, and moats with marshy pool.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
One of this pair (besides that, of his will,<BR>
He honours you, and does you courtesies;<BR>
And makes Parnassus and high Cynthus&#8217; hill<BR>
Resound your praise, and lift it to the skies)<BR>
The love, the faith, and mind, unconquered still,<BR>
Mid threats of ruin, which in stedfast wise<BR>
To him his constant Isabel hath shown,<BR>
Render yet more your champion than his own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
So that he never more will wearied be<BR>
With quickening in his verse your high renown;<BR>
And, if another censures you, than he<BR>
Prompter to arm in your defence is none;<BR>
Nor knight, in this wide world, more willingly<BR>
Life in the cause of virtue would lay down:<BR>
Matter as well for other&#8217;s pen he gives,<BR>
As in his own another&#8217;s glory lives;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
And well he merits, that a dame so blest,<BR>
(Blest with all worth, which in this earthly round<BR>
Is seen in them who don the female vest,)<BR>
To him hath evermore been faithful found;<BR>
Of a sure pillar of pure truth possest<BR>
In her, despising Fortune&#8217;s every wound.<BR>
Worthy of one another are the twain;<BR>
Nor better ere were paired in wedlock&#8217;s chain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
New trophies he on Oglio&#8217;s bank has shown;<BR>
For he, mid bark and car, amid the gleam<BR>
Of fire and sword, such goodly rhymes hath strown,<BR>
As may with envy swell the neighbouring stream.<BR>
By Hercules Bentivoglio next is blown<BR>
The noble strain, your honour&#8217;s noble theme;<BR>
Reynet Trivulzio and Guidetti mine,<BR>
And Molza, called of Ph&#339;bus and the Nine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
There&#8217;s Hercules of the Carnuti, son<BR>
Of my own duke, who spreads his every plume<BR>
Soaring and singing, like harmonious swan,<BR>
And even to heaven uplifts your name; with whom<BR>
There is my lord of Guasto, not alone<BR>
A theme for many an Athens, many a Rome;<BR>
In his high strain he promises as well,<BR>
Your praise to all posterity to tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
And beside these and others of our day,<BR>
Who gave you once, or give you now renown,<BR>
This for yourselves ye may yourselves purvey:<BR>
For many, laying silk and sampler down,<BR>
With the melodious Muses, to allay<BR>
Their thirst at Aganippe&#8217;s well, have gone,<BR>
And still are going; who so fairly speed,<BR>
That we more theirs than they our labour need.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
If I of these would separately tell,<BR>
And render good account and honour due,<BR>
More than one page I with their praise should swell,<BR>
Nor ought beside would this day&#8217;s canto shew;<BR>
And if on five or six alone I dwell,<BR>
I may offend and anger all the crew.<BR>
What then shall I resolve? to pass all by?<BR>
Or choose but one from such a company?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
One will I choose, and such will choose, that she<BR>
All envy shall so well have overthrown,<BR>
No other woman can offend be,<BR>
If, passing others, her I praise alone:<BR>
Nor joys this one but immortality,<BR>
Through her sweet style (and better know I none):<BR>
But who is honoured in her speech and page,<BR>
Shall burst the tomb, and live through every age.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
As Ph&#339;bus to his silvery sister shows<BR>
His visage more, and lends her brighter fires,<BR>
Than Venus, Maja, or to star that glows<BR>
Alone, or circles with the heavenly quires;<BR>
So he with sweeter eloquence than flows<BR>
From other lips, that gentle dame inspires;<BR>
And gives her word such force, a second sun<BR>
Seems in our days its glorious course to run.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Mid victories born, Victoria is her name,<BR>
Well named; and whom (does she advance or stay)<BR>
Triumphs and trophies evermore proclaim,<BR>
While Victory heads or follows her array.<BR>
Another Artemisia is the dame,<BR>
Renowned for love of her Mausolus, yea<BR>
By so much greater, as it is more brave<BR>
To raise the dead, than lay them in the grave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
If chaste Laodamia, Portia true,<BR>
Evadne, Argia, Arria, and many more<BR>
Merited praise, because that glorious crew<BR>
Coveted burial with their lords of yore,<BR>
How much more fame is to Victoria due?<BR>
That from dull Lethe, and the river&#8217;s shore,<BR>
Which nine times hems the ghosts, to upper light<BR>
Has dragged her lord, in death and fate&#8217;s despite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
If that loud-voiced Maeonian trump whilere<BR>
The Macedonian grudged Achilles, how,<BR>
Francis Pescara, O unconquered peer,<BR>
Would he begrudge thee, were he living now,<BR>
That wife, so virtuous and to thee so dear,<BR>
Thy well-earned glory through the world should blow;<BR>
And that thy name through her should so rebound,<BR>
Thou needst not crave a clearer trumpet&#8217;s sound!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
If all that is to tell, and all I fain<BR>
Would of that lady tell, I wished to unfold,<BR>
Though long, yet not so long, would be the stain,<BR>
But that large portion would be left untold,<BR>
While at a stand the story would remain<BR>
Of fierce Marphisa and her comrades bold;<BR>
To follow whom I promised erst, if you<BR>
Would but return to hear my song anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Now, being here to listen to my say,<BR>
Because I would not break my promise, I<BR>
Until my better leisure, will delay<BR>
Her every praise at length to certify.<BR>
Not that I think she needs my humble lay,<BR>
Who with such treasure can herself supply:<BR>
But simply to appay my single end,<BR>
That gentle dame to honour and commend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Ladies, in fine I say, that every age<BR>
Worthy of story, many a dame supplies;<BR>
But that, through jealous authors&#8217; envious rage,<BR>
Unchronicled by fame, each matron dies;<BR>
But will no more; since in the historic page<BR>
Your virtues ye, yourselves, immortalize.<BR>
Had those two damsels in this art been read,<BR>
Their every warlike deed had wider spread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Bradamant and Marphisa would I say,<BR>
Whose bold, victorious deeds, in battle done,<BR>
I strive to bring into the light of day;<BR>
But nine in ten remain to me unknown.<BR>
I what I know right willingly display;<BR>
As well, that all fair actions should be shown,<BR>
As well that, gentle ladies, I am bent<BR>
Ye whom I love and honour, to content.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
As said, in act to go Rogero stood;<BR>
And, having taken leave, the cavalier<BR>
Withdraws his trenchant faulchion from the wood,<BR>
Which holds no more the weapon, as whilere.<BR>
When, sounding loud amid that solitude,<BR>
A cry, not distant far, arrests the peer.<BR>
Then thitherward he with those damsels made,<BR>
Prompt, if &#8217;twere needed, to bestow his aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
They rode an-end; and louder waxed the sound,<BR>
And plainer were the plaintive words they heard:<BR>
When in a valley they three women found<BR>
Making that plaint, who in strange garb appeared:<BR>
For to the navel were those three ungowned,<BR>
&#8212;Their coats by some uncourteous varlet sheared&#8212;<BR>
And knowing not how better to disguise<BR>
Their shame, they sate on earth, and dared not rise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
As Vulcan&#8217;s son, that sprang (as it is versed)<BR>
Out of the dust, without a mother made,<BR>
Whom&#8212;so Minerva bade&#8212;Aglauros nursed<BR>
With sovereign care, too bold and curious maid,<BR>
Seated in car, by him constructed first<BR>
To hide his hideous feet, was erst conveyed;<BR>
So that which never is to sight revealed,<BR>
Sitting, those mournful damsels kept concealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
At that dishonest sight and shameful, glows<BR>
Each martial damsel&#8217;s visage, overspread<BR>
With the rich dyes of Paestum&#8217;s crimson rose,<BR>
When vernal airs their gentle influence shed.<BR>
Bradamant marked them; and that one of those<BR>
Was Ulany, the damsel quickly read;<BR>
Ulany, that was sent with solemn train<BR>
From the LOST ISLE to royal Charlemagne;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
And recognised the other two no less;<BR>
From them she saw, when she saw Ulany;<BR>
But now to her directed her address.<BR>
As the most honoured of those ladies three,<BR>
Demanding, who so full of wickedness,<BR>
So lawless was and so unmannerly,<BR>
That he those secrets to the sight revealed,<BR>
Which Nature, as she could, &#8217;twould seem, concealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Ulany, that in Bradamant descried,<BR>
&#8212;Known both by voice and ensignry&#8212;the maid,<BR>
Who some few days before those knights of pride<BR>
With her victorious lance on earth had laid,<BR>
How, in a town not far remote&#8212;replied&#8212;<BR>
An evil race, by pity never swayed,<BR>
Besides that they their raiment thus had shorn,<BR>
Had beat them, and had done them other scorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
What of the shield became, she cannot say,<BR>
Nor knows she those three monarchs&#8217; destiny,<BR>
Who guided her so long upon her way;<BR>
If killed, or led into captivity;<BR>
And says that she herself has ta&#8217;en her way,<BR>
Albeit to fare a-foot sore irksome be,<BR>
To appeal to royal Charlemagne, assured<BR>
By him such outrage will not be endured.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
To hear, yet more to see, so foul a wrong,<BR>
Disturbed the Child and damsels&#8217; placid air<BR>
And beauteous visage, whose bold hearts and strong<BR>
No less compassionate than valiant were.<BR>
They now, all else forgetting, ere the tongue<BR>
Of Ulany prefers demand, or prayer,<BR>
That they would venge them on their cruel foe,<BR>
In haste towards the felon&#8217;s castle go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
With one constant, the maids and cavalier,<BR>
By their great goodness moved, from plate and mail<BR>
Had stript their upper vests, well fitting gear<BR>
Those miserable ladies&#8217; shame to veil.<BR>
Bradamant suffers not, that, as whilere,<BR>
Sad Ulany shall tramp by hill and dale;<BR>
But seats her on her horse&#8217;s croup; so do<BR>
Her comrades by those other damsels two.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
To gentle Bradamant Ulania showed<BR>
The nearest way to reach the castle height;<BR>
While comfort Bradamant on her bestowed,<BR>
Promising vengeance for that foul despite.<BR>
They leave the vale, and by a crooked road<BR>
And long ascend, now wheeling left, now right:<BR>
Nor till the sun is hidden in the sea,<BR>
Upon their weary way repose the three.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
They to a hamlet on the summit wound,<BR>
Scaling the mountain&#8217;s steep and rugged side;<BR>
And such good shelter and good supper found,<BR>
As could by such rude quarters be supplied.<BR>
Arriving there, they turned their eyes around,<BR>
And full of women every place espied,<BR>
Some old, some young; nor, mid so large a clan,<BR>
Appeared the visage of a single man.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Not more bold Jason wondered, and the train<BR>
Which sailed with him, that Argonautic crew,<BR>
Seeing those dames that had their husbands slain,<BR>
Fathers and sons and brethren,&#8212;so that through<BR>
All Lemnos&#8217; pleasant isle, by hill or plain,<BR>
Of manly visage they beheld not two&#8212;<BR>
Than here Rogero, and the rest who go<BR>
With good Rogero, wonder at this show.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
The martial damsels bid for Ulany,<BR>
And those who came with her, provide attire;<BR>
And gowns that eve are furnished for the three,<BR>
If meaner than their own, at least entire.<BR>
To him a woman of that villagery<BR>
Valiant Rogero summons, to inquire<BR>
Where are the men; in that he none descries;<BR>
And thus to him that village wife replies:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What haply is to you a wonderment,<BR>
This crowd of womankind, where man is none,<BR>
To us is grave and grievous punishment,<BR>
Who, banished here, live wofully alone;<BR>
And, that such exile us may more torment,<BR>
From those so loved, as brother, father, son,<BR>
A long divorce and cruel we sustain,<BR>
As our fell tyrant pleases to ordain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Sent to these confines from his land, which lies<BR>
But two leagues distant thence, where we were born,<BR>
Us in this place the fell barbarian sties,<BR>
Having first done us many a brutal scorn;<BR>
And has with death and all extremities<BR>
Threatened our kinsmen and ourselves forlorn,<BR>
If they come hither, or he hears report<BR>
We harbour them, when hither they resort.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He to our name is such a deadly foe,<BR>
He will not have us nearer than I shewed,<BR>
Now have us of our kin approached, as though<BR>
Infection from the female sex ensued.<BR>
Already have the greenwood trees laid low<BR>
Their leafy honours twice, and twice renewed,<BR>
Since our lord&#8217;s fury to such pitch arose,<BR>
Now is there one his phrensy to oppose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For he has spread such passing fear among<BR>
The people, death can cause no worse affright;<BR>
In that, beside his natural love of wrong,<BR>
He is endowed with more than human might.<BR>
He than a hundred other men more strong,<BR>
In body is of a gigantic height:<BR>
Nor us his vassals he molests alone;<BR>
But worse by him to stranger dame is done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If your own honour, sir, and of those three,<BR>
Beneath your charge, to you in aught is dear,<BR>
&#8217;Twill safer, usefuller, and better be<BR>
To leave this road, and by another steer.<BR>
This leads you to his tower, described by me,<BR>
To prove the savage use that cruel peer<BR>
Has there established, to the shame and woe<BR>
Of dame or cavalier, who thither go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This castellain or tyrant, Marganor<BR>
(So name the felon knight) than whom more fell<BR>
Nero was not, nor other heretofore,<BR>
If other be, whose actions Fame doth swell,<BR>
Thirsts for man&#8217;s blood, but thirsts for woman&#8217;s more<BR>
Than wolf for blood of lambs; and bids expel<BR>
With shame all females, that, in evil hour,<BR>
Their fortune has conducted to his tower.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
How in that impious man such fury grew,<BR>
Asked young Rogero and those damsels twain,<BR>
And prayed she would in courtesy pursue,<BR>
Yea, rather from the first her tale explain.<BR>
&#8220;That castle&#8217;s lord, fierce, and inhumane,<BR>
Yet for a while his wicked heart concealed,<BR>
Nor what he was so suddenly revealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For in the lifetime of his sons, a pair<BR>
That differed much from the paternal style,<BR>
(Since they the stranger loved; and loathers were<BR>
Of cruelty and other actions vile)<BR>
Flourished the courtesies and good customs there,<BR>
And there were gentle deeds performed this while:<BR>
For. albeit avaricious was the sire,<BR>
He never crossed the youths in their desire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The cavaliers and dames who journeyed by<BR>
That castle, there so well were entertained,<BR>
That they departed, by the courtesy<BR>
Of those two kindly brothers wholly gained.<BR>
In the holy orders of fair chivalry<BR>
Alike the youthful pair had been ordained.<BR>
Cylander one, Tanacro hight the other;<BR>
Bold, and of royal mien each martial brother;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And truly were, and would have been alway<BR>
Worthy of every praise and fame, withal<BR>
Had they not yielded up themselves a prey<BR>
To that uncurbed desire, which Love we call;<BR>
By which they were seduced from the right way<BR>
Into foul Error&#8217;s crooked maze; and all<BR>
The good that by those brethren had been wrought,<BR>
Waxed, in a moment, rank, corrupt and naught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;It chanced, that in their father&#8217;s fortilage,<BR>
A knight of the Greek emperor&#8217;s court did lie;<BR>
With him his lady was; of manners sage;<BR>
Nor fairer could be craved by wishful eye:<BR>
For her Cylander felt such amorous rage,<BR>
He deemed, save he enjoyed her, he should die;<BR>
He deemed that, when the lady should depart,<BR>
His soul as well would from his body part:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, for he knew &#8217;twas useless to entreat,<BR>
Devised to make her his by force of hand;<BR>
Armed, and in silence, near his father&#8217;s seat,<BR>
Where must pass knight and lady, took his stand.<BR>
Through natural daring and through amorous heat,<BR>
He with too little thought the matter planned;<BR>
So that, when he beheld the knight advance,<BR>
He issued, to assail him, lance to lance.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To overthrow him, at first shock he thought,<BR>
And to win dame and palm in the career;<BR>
But that Greek knight, in warlike strife well-taught,<BR>
Shivered, like glass, his breastplate with the spear.<BR>
The bitter tidings to the sire were brought,<BR>
Who bade bear home the stripling on a bier:<BR>
He, finding he was dead, loud mourning made,<BR>
And him in earth, beside his fathers, layed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet harbourage and welcome as before<BR>
Had he who sought it; neither more nor less:<BR>
Because Tanacro in his courteous lore<BR>
Equalled his brother as in gentleness.<BR>
Thither that very year, from foreign shore,<BR>
A baron and his wife their steps address:<BR>
A marvel he of valour, and as fair<BR>
As could be said, is she, and debonnair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No fairer was the dame than chaste and right,<BR>
And well deserving every praise; the peer<BR>
Derived of generous stock, and bold in fight,<BR>
As ever champion, of whose fame we hear;<BR>
And &#8217;tis well fitting, that such valiant wight<BR>
Should joy a thing so excellent and dear,<BR>
Olindro he, the lord of Lungavilla,<BR>
And she, his lady wife, yclept Drusilla.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No less for her the young Tanacro glows,<BR>
Than for that other burned Cylander sore;<BR>
Who brought erewhile to sad and bitter close<BR>
The wicked love he to that lady bore.<BR>
The holy, hospitable laws he chose<BR>
To violate no less than he, before<BR>
He would endure, that him, with venomed sting,<BR>
His new desire to cruel death should bring.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But he, because he has before his eyes<BR>
The example of his elder brother slain,<BR>
Thinks to bear off the lady in such wise,<BR>
That bold Olindro cannot venge the stain.<BR>
Straight spent in him, not simply weakened, lies<BR>
The virtue, wont Tancaro to sustain<BR>
Above that flood of vice, in whose profound<BR>
And miry waters Marganor lay drowned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That night, he in deep silence bade array<BR>
A score of armed men; and next conveyed<BR>
Into some caverns, bordering on the way,<BR>
And distant from the tower, his ambuscade.<BR>
The roads were broken, and the following day<BR>
Olindro from all sides was overlaid;<BR>
And, though he made a brave defence and long,<BR>
Of wife and life was plundered by that throng.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Olindro slain, they led his lady fair<BR>
A captive thence, o&#8217;erwhelmed with sorrow so,<BR>
That she refused to live, and made her prayer,<BR>
Tanacro, as a grace, would death bestow:<BR>
Resolved to die, she leapt, in her despair,<BR>
From a high bank into a vale below;<BR>
But death was to the wretched dame refused;<BR>
Who lay with shattered head and sorely bruised.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She could not to the castle be conveyed<BR>
In other guise than borne upon a bier:<BR>
Her (so Tanacro bids) prompt leeches aid;<BR>
Because he will not lose a prey so dear;<BR>
And while to cure Drusilla they essayed,<BR>
Busied about their spousals was the peer:<BR>
In that so chaste a lady and so fair,<BR>
A wife&#8217;s and not a leman&#8217;s name should wear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He had no other thought, no other aim,<BR>
No other care, nor spake beside of ought;<BR>
Saw he had wronged her, and took all the blame,<BR>
And, as he could, to amend his error wrought:<BR>
But all was vain; the more he loved the dame,<BR>
The more be to appease her anger sought,<BR>
So much more was her hate; so much more will,<BR>
So much more thirst had she that youth to kill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet hatred blinded not her judgment so,<BR>
But what the dame could clearly comprehend,<BR>
That she, if she would strike the purposed blow,<BR>
Must feign, and secret snares for him extend.<BR>
And her desire beneath another show<BR>
(Which is but how Tanacro to offend)<BR>
Must mask; and make him think, that overblown<BR>
Is her first love, and turned to him alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her face speaks peace; while vengeance inwardly<BR>
Her heart demands, and but to this attends:<BR>
She many things revolves, accepts, puts by;<BR>
Or, as of doubtful issue, some suspends.<BR>
Deeming she can, if she resolves to die,<BR>
Compass her scheme, with this resolve she ends;<BR>
And better how can she expend her breath<BR>
Than in avenging dear Olindro&#8217;s death?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She showed herself all joyful, on her part,<BR>
And feigned that she desired those nuptials sore;<BR>
Nor only showed an unreluctant heart;<BR>
But all delay and hindrance overbore.<BR>
Painted and tired above the rest with art,<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem, she of her husband thinks no more:<BR>
But &#8217;tis her will, that in her country&#8217;s wise<BR>
Tanacro shall their wedding solemnize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The custom howsoever was not true,<BR>
Which as her country&#8217;s use she certified;<BR>
But, because never thought within her grew<BR>
Which she could spend on any thing beside,<BR>
A falsehood she devised, whence hope she drew<BR>
Of killing him by whom her husband died;<BR>
And told Tanacro&#8212;and the manner said&#8212;<BR>
How in her country&#8217;s fashion she would wed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;The widow that a husband&#8217;s bed ascends,<BR>
Ere she approach the bridegroom (said that fair)<BR>
The spirit of the dead, whom she offends,<BR>
Must soothe with solemn office, mass and prayer;<BR>
In the holy temple making her amends,<BR>
Where her first husband&#8217;s bones entombed are.<BR>
&#8212;That sacrifice performed&#8212;to bind their vows<BR>
The nuptial ring the bridegroom gives the spouse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;But the holy priest, while this shall be about,<BR>
Upon wine, thither for that purpose sped,<BR>
His orisons, appropriate and devout,<BR>
Blessing withal the liquor, shall have said;<BR>
Then from the flask into a cup pour out,<BR>
And give the blessed wine to them that wed.<BR>
But &#8217;tis the spouse&#8217;s part to take the cup;<BR>
And first that vessel&#8217;s cordial beverage sup.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The unsuspecting youth, who takes no heed<BR>
What nuptials, ordered in her wise, import,<BR>
At her own pleasure bids the dame proceed,<BR>
So that she cut his terms of waiting short;<BR>
Nor does the miserable stripling read<BR>
She would avenge Olindro in that sort;<BR>
And on one object is so sore intent,<BR>
He sees but that, on that alone is bent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;An ancient woman, seized with her whilere,<BR>
And left, withal, obeyed Drusilla, who<BR>
That beldam called and whispered in her ear,<BR>
So as that none beside could hear the two&#8212;<BR>
A poison of quick power for me prepare,<BR>
Such as, I know, thou knowest how to brew;<BR>
And bottle it; for I have found a way<BR>
The traitorous son of Marganor to slay;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And me and thee no less can save,&#8217; (she said,)<BR>
&#8216;And this at better leisure will explain.&#8217;<BR>
The woman went her ways, the potion made,<BR>
And to the palace bent her steps again:<BR>
A flask of Candian sweet wine she purveyed,<BR>
Wherewith Drusilla sheathed that deadly bane;<BR>
And kept the beverage for the nuptial day;<BR>
For now had ceased all hindrance and delay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;On the fixt day she seeks the temple, dight<BR>
With precious jewels and with goodly gear;<BR>
Where her lord&#8217;s tomb, befitting such a knight,<BR>
Built by her order, two fair pillars rear.<BR>
The holy office there, with solemn rite,<BR>
Is sung, which men and women troop to hear;<BR>
And&#8212;gay, beyond his usage&#8212;with his heir,<BR>
Begirt by friends, Sir Marganor is there.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When the holy obsequies at last were o&#8217;er,<BR>
And by the priest was blest the poisoned draught,<BR>
He into a fair golden cup did pour<BR>
The wine, as by Drusilla had been taught,<BR>
She drank what sorted with her sex; nor more<BR>
Than would effect the purpose which she sought:<BR>
Then to the bridegroom, with a jocund eye,<BR>
Handed the draught, who drained the goblet dry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The cup returned&#8212;Tanacro, blithe and gay,<BR>
Opened his arms Drusilla to embrace.<BR>
Then altered was her sweet and winning way,<BR>
And to a tempest that long calm gave place.<BR>
She thrust him back, she motioned him away;<BR>
She seemed to kindle in her eyes and face;<BR>
And to the youth, with broken voice and dread,<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;Traitor, stand off,&#8217;&#8212;the furious lady said;&#8212;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Shalt thou then joy and solace have from me,<BR>
I tears from thee, and punishment and woe?<BR>
Now these mine hands shall make an end of thee.<BR>
This, if thou know&#8217;st it not, for poison know.<BR>
Much grieve I that thou should&#8217;st too honoured be<BR>
By the executioner who deals the blow;<BR>
Should&#8217;st die a death too easy: since I wot,<BR>
For thee too shameful hand or pain is not.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;In seeing this thy death, it gives me pain,<BR>
My sacrifice should be completed ill;<BR>
For could I do by thee as I were fain,<BR>
Nothing should lack that purpose to fulfill.<BR>
May my sweet consort not the work disdain,<BR>
And for the imperfect deed accept the will!<BR>
That, without power to compass what I would,<BR>
I have been fain to slay thee as I could!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And that deserved punishment, which I<BR>
Cannot, as I desire, on thee bestow,<BR>
I hope thy soul shall have; hope to be nigh,<BR>
To see thee suffer, in the realms of woe.&#8217;<BR>
Her turbid eyes then raising to the sky,<BR>
With joyous face all over in a glow,<BR>
(She cried) &#8216;Olindro, take this victim&#8217;s life,<BR>
With the good will of thine avenging wife;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And of our lord for me the grace obtain,<BR>
To be this day in paradise with thee,<BR>
If he reply, none cometh to your reign,<BR>
Without desert; say such I bring with me,<BR>
Who this fell impious monster, in his fane,<BR>
Offer, as my first-fruits; and what can be<BR>
A greater merit than to have supprest<BR>
Such loathsome and abominable pest?&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her life, together with her speech, was spent;<BR>
And, even dead, her face appeared to glow<BR>
With joy, at having dealt such punishment<BR>
To him, that laid her cherished husband low.<BR>
If fierce Tanacro&#8217;s spirit did prevent,<BR>
Of follow hers, I wiss not; but, I trow,<BR>
Prevented, for on him that venom rank<BR>
Yet faster wrought, because he deeper drank.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Marganor, who beheld his only son<BR>
Fall and expire, his outstretched arms between,<BR>
Well nigh had with Tanacro died, o&#8217;erthrown<BR>
By that so sudden grief and unforeseen.<BR>
Two sons he had, and now was left alone;<BR>
Brought to that pass he by two wives had been;<BR>
This was the cause one spent his vital breath<BR>
With her own hand, that dealt the other death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Love, pity, sorrow, anger, and desire<BR>
Of death and vengeance, all together rend<BR>
And rack the childless and unhappy sire,<BR>
Who groans like sea, when wind and waves contend:<BR>
Towards the dame, with vengeful thoughts afire,<BR>
He goes, but sees that life is at an end;<BR>
And, goaded by his rage and hatred hot,<BR>
Seeks to offend her corse that feels it not.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As serpent, by the pointed spear pinned down,<BR>
Fixes his teeth in it, with fruitless spire;<BR>
Or as the mastiff runs towards a stone,<BR>
Which has been flung by some wayfaring wight,<BR>
And gnaws it in his rage, nor will be gone<BR>
Until he venge himself; &#8217;tis so the knight,<BR>
Than any mastiff, any serpent, worse<BR>
Offends Drusilla&#8217;s cold and lifeless corse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, for he venteth not, nor slakes his mood,<BR>
By foul abuse upon the carcase done,<BR>
Among the women, a large multitude,<BR>
He springs, and there shows mercy unto none.<BR>
Mown are we with his impious sword, as strewed<BR>
Is grass with scythe, when dried by summer sun.<BR>
There is no &#8217;scape; for straightways of our train<BR>
Are full a hundred maimed, and thirty slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He of his vassals is so held in dread,<BR>
There is no man who dares to lift his eyes:<BR>
The women with the meaner sort are fled,<BR>
And whosoever can, the temple flies.<BR>
His friends against the furious fit make head,<BR>
At last, with kind constraint and suppliant cries;<BR>
And, leaving every thing in tears below,<BR>
Him in his castle on the rock bestow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His wrath enduring still, to send away<BR>
The wretch determines all the female band:<BR>
In that, his will us utterly to slay<BR>
His people and his friends, with prayer, withstand;<BR>
And he bids punish, on that very day,<BR>
An order for us all to leave his land;<BR>
Placed such his pleasures on these confines: woe<BR>
To them that nearer to his castle go!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thus husbands from their wives divided are,<BR>
Mothers from sons: if hither to resort,<BR>
Despite that order, any one should dare,<BR>
Let none know this, who might the deed report!<BR>
For sorely mulcted for the transgression were<BR>
Many, and many slain in cruel sort.<BR>
A statute for his town next made the peer:<BR>
Of fouler law we neither read nor hear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;It wills, all women found within the vale,<BR>
(For thither even yet will some descend,)<BR>
His men with rods shall on the shoulders whale,<BR>
And into exile from those countries send;<BR>
But first their gowns shall clip, and parts unveil<BR>
That decency and natural shame offend;<BR>
And if with escort of an armed knight<BR>
Any wend thither, they are slain outright.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Those that an armed warrior&#8217;s escort have,<BR>
By this ill man, to piety a foe,<BR>
Are dragged as victims to his children&#8217;s grave,<BR>
Where his own hand inflicts the murderous blow.<BR>
Stript ignominiously of armour, glaive,<BR>
And steed, their champions to his prisons go;<BR>
And this can he compel; for, night and day,<BR>
A thousand men the tyrant&#8217;s hest obey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And I will add, moreover, &#8217;tis his will,<BR>
Does he free any one, he first shall swear<BR>
Upon the holy wafer, that he still<BR>
To woman, while he lives, will hatred bear.<BR>
If then these ladies and yourself to spill<BR>
Seem good to you, to yonder walls repair;<BR>
And put to proof withal, if prowess more<BR>
Or cruelty prevails in Marganor.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
So saying, in those maids of martial might<BR>
First she such pity moved and then disdain,<BR>
That they (had it been day instead of night)<BR>
Would then have gone against that castellain.<BR>
There rest the troop; and when Aurora&#8217;s light<BR>
Serves as a signal to the starry train,<BR>
That they should all before the sun recede,<BR>
They don the cuirass and remount the steed:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
And now, in act to go, that company<BR>
Behind them hear the stony road resound<BR>
With a long trample, when those warlike three<BR>
Look down the vale and roll their eyes around;<BR>
And they from thence, a stone&#8217;s-throw distant, see<BR>
A troop, which through a narrow pathway wound:<BR>
A score they are perhaps in number, who<BR>
On horseback, or on foot, their way pursue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
They with them on a horse a woman haul,<BR>
(Whom stricken sore in years her visage shows,)<BR>
In guise wherein some doleful criminal<BR>
Condemned to gallows, fire, or prison goes;<BR>
Who, notwithstanding that wide interval,<BR>
Is by her features known, as well as clothes:<BR>
They of the village, mid the cavalcade,<BR>
Know her for fair Drusilla&#8217;s chamber maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
The chamber wench, made prisoner with his prize,<BR>
By the rapacious stripling, as I shewed,<BR>
Who being trusted with that ill emprize,<BR>
The poisoned draught of foul effect had brewed.<BR>
From the others she and those solemnites<BR>
Had kept away, suspecting what ensued:<BR>
Yea, this while, from that lordship had she fled,<BR>
Where she in safety hoped to hide her head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
News being after to her foeman brought,<BR>
That she retired in Ostericche lay,<BR>
He, with intent to burn the woman, sought<BR>
To have her in his power by every way;<BR>
And finally unhappy Avarice, bought<BR>
By costly presents, and by proffered pay,<BR>
Wrought on a lord, assured upon whose lands<BR>
The beldam lived, to put her in his hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
He on a sumpter horse the prisoner sent<BR>
To Constance-town, like merchandise addrest;<BR>
Fastened and bound in manner to prevent<BR>
The use of speech, and prisoned in a chest.<BR>
From whence that rabble, his ill instrument,<BR>
Who has all pity banished from his breast,<BR>
Had hither brought her, that his impious rage<BR>
That cruel man might on the hag assuage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
As the flood, swoln with Vesulo&#8217;s thick snows,<BR>
The farther that it foams upon its way,<BR>
And, with Ticino and Lambra, seaward goes,<BR>
Ada, and other streams that tribute pay,<BR>
So much more haughty and impetuous flows;<BR>
Rogero so, the more he hears display<BR>
Marganor&#8217;s guilt, and so that gentle pair<BR>
Of damsels filled with fiercer choler are.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Them with such hatred, them with such disdain<BR>
Against the wretch so many crimes incense,<BR>
That they will punish him, despite the train<BR>
Or armed men arraid in his defence:<BR>
But speedy death appears too kind a pain,<BR>
And insufficient for such foul offence.<BR>
Better they deem, mid pangs prolonged and slow,<BR>
He all the bitterness of death should know.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
But first &#8217;tis right that woman to unchain,<BR>
She whom the hangman-crew to death escort;<BR>
And the quick rowel and the loosened rein<BR>
Made the quick coursers make that labour short.<BR>
Never had those assaulted to sustain<BR>
Encounter of so fell and fierce a sort;<BR>
Who held it for a grace, with loss of shield,<BR>
Harness and captive dame, to quit the field;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Even as the wolf, who, laden with his prey,<BR>
Is homeward to his secret cavern bound,<BR>
And, when he deems that safest is the way,<BR>
Beholds it crost by hunter and by hound,<BR>
Flings down his load, and swiftly darts away,<BR>
Where most o&#8217;ergrown with brushwood is the ground.<BR>
Nor quicker are that band to void the vale,<BR>
Than those bold three are quicker to assail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Not only they the dame and martial gear,<BR>
But many horses they as well forsook;<BR>
And, as the surest refuge in their fear,<BR>
Cast themselves down from bank and caverned nook:<BR>
Which pleased the damsels and the youthful peer;<BR>
Who three of those forsaken horses took,<BR>
To mount those three, whom, through the day before,<BR>
Upon their croups the three good coursers bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Thence, lightened thus, their way they thither bend,<BR>
Where that despiteous, shameful, lordship lies;<BR>
Resolved the beldam in their band shall wend,<BR>
To see Drusilla venged; in vain denies<BR>
That woman, who misdoubts the adventure&#8217;s end,<BR>
And grieves, and shrieks, and weeps in piteous wise:<BR>
For flinging her upon Frontino&#8217;s croup,<BR>
Rogero bears her off amid the troop.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
They reached a summit, and from thence espied<BR>
A town with many houses, large and rich;<BR>
With nought to stop the way on any side,<BR>
As neither compassed round by wall or ditch.<BR>
A rock was in the middle, fortified<BR>
With a tall tower, upon its topmost pitch.<BR>
Fearlessly thither pricked the warriors, who<BR>
Marganor&#8217;s mansion in that fortress knew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
As soon as in the town that cavalcade<BR>
Arrived, some footmen, who kept watch and ward,<BR>
Behind those warriors closed a barricade;<BR>
While that, before, they found already barred.<BR>
And lo! Sir Marganor, with men arraid,<BR>
Some foot, some horsemen! armed was all the guard;<BR>
Who to the strangers, in few words, but bold,<BR>
The wicked custom of his lordship told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Marphisa, who had planned the thing whilere<BR>
With Aymon&#8217;s daughter and the youthful knight,<BR>
For answer, spurred against the cavalier;<BR>
And, valiant as she was and full of might,<BR>
Not putting in the rest her puissant spear,<BR>
Or baring that good sword, so famed in fight,<BR>
So smote him with her fist upon the head,<BR>
That on his horse&#8217;s neck he fell half dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
The maid of France is with Marphisa gone,<BR>
Nor in the rear it seen Rogero&#8217;s crest;<BR>
Who with those two his course so bravely run,<BR>
That, though his lance he raised not from the rest,<BR>
Six men he slew; transfixed the paunch of one,<BR>
Another&#8217;s head, of four the neck or breast;<BR>
I&#8217; the sixth he broke it, whom in flight he speared:<BR>
It pierced his spine and at his paps appeared.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
As many as are touched, so many lie<BR>
On earth, by Bradamant&#8217;s gold lance o&#8217;erthrown;<BR>
She seems a bolt, dismist form burning sky,<BR>
Which, in its fury, shivers and beats down<BR>
Whatever it encounters, far and nigh.<BR>
Some fly to plain, or castle from the town,<BR>
Others to sheltering church and house repair;<BR>
And none, save dead, are seen in street or square.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile the hands of Marganor, behind<BR>
His back, the fierce Marphisa had made fast,<BR>
And to Drusilla&#8217;s maid the wretch consigned,<BR>
Well pleased that such a care on her was cast.<BR>
To burn the town &#8217;twas afterwards designed,<BR>
Save it repented of its errors past,<BR>
Repealed the statute Marganor had made,<BR>
And a new law, imposed by her, obeyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
Such end to compass is no hard assay;<BR>
For, besides fearing lest Marphisa yearn<BR>
To execute more vengeance,&#8212;lest she say,<BR>
&#8212;She one and all will slaughter and will burn,&#8212;<BR>
The townsmen all were advised to the sway<BR>
And cruel statute of that tyrant stern;<BR>
But did, as others mostly do, that best<BR>
Obey the master whom they most detest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
Since none dares trust another, nor his will,<BR>
&#8212;Out of suspicion&#8212;to his comrades break,<BR>
They let him banish one, another kill,<BR>
From this his substance, that his honour take.<BR>
But the heart cries to Heaven, that here is still,<BR>
Till God and saints at length to vengeance wake:<BR>
Who, albeit they due punishment suspend,<BR>
By mighty pain the long delay amend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
The rabble, full of rage and enmity,<BR>
Now seeks the wretch with word and deed to grieve;<BR>
As, it is said, all strip the fallen tree,<BR>
Which from its roots and wintry winds upheave:<BR>
Let rulers in his sad example see,<BR>
Ill doers in the end shall ill receive.<BR>
To view fell Marganor&#8217;s disastrous fall,<BR>
Fit penance for his sins, pleased great and small.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
Many, of whom the sister had been slain,<BR>
The mother, or the daughter, or the wife,<BR>
Seeking no more their rebel wrath to rein,<BR>
Hurry, with their own hands to take his life;<BR>
And young Rogero and the damsels twain<BR>
Can scarce defend the felon in that strife;<BR>
Whom those illustrious three had doomed to die,<BR>
Mid trouble, fear, and lengthened agony.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
To the hag, who bore such hatred to that wight,<BR>
As woman to an enemy can bear,<BR>
They give their prisoner naked, bound so tight,<BR>
He will not at one shake the cordage tear;<BR>
And she, her pains and sorrow to requite,<BR>
Crimsons the wretch&#8217;s body, here and there,<BR>
With a sharp goad, which, mid that village band,<BR>
A peasant churl had put into her hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
Nor she the courier maid, nor they that ride<BR>
With her, aye mindful how they had been shent,<BR>
Now let their hands hang idle by their side;<BR>
No less than that old crone on vengeance bent:<BR>
Such was their fierce desire, it nullified<BR>
The power to harm; but rage must have its vent.,<BR>
Him one with stones, another with her nails,<BR>
This with her teeth, with needles that, assails.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
As torrent one while foams in haughty tide,<BR>
When fed with mighty rain or melted snow;<BR>
And, rending form the mountain&#8217;s rugged side<BR>
Tree, rock, and crop and field, the waters go:<BR>
Then comes a season when its crested pride<BR>
Is vanished, and its vigour wasted so,<BR>
A child, a woman, everywhere may tread,<BR>
And often dry-shod cross, its rugged bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
So Marganor whilere each bound and bourn<BR>
Made tremble, whereso&#8217;er his name was heard:<BR>
Now one is come to bruise the tyrant&#8217;s horn;<BR>
And now his prowess is so little feared,<BR>
That even the little children work him scorn:<BR>
Some pluck his hair and others pluck his beard.<BR>
Thence young Rogero and the damsels twain<BR>
Towards his rock-built castle turn the rein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
This without contest its possessors yield,<BR>
And the rich goods preserved in that repair.<BR>
These the friends partly spoiled, and partly dealed<BR>
To Ulany and that attendant pair.<BR>
With them, recovered was the golden shield,<BR>
And those three monarchs that were prisoned there;<BR>
Who, without arms, afoot, towards that hold<BR>
Had wended, as meseems whilere was told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
For from the day that they were overthrown<BR>
By Bradamant, afoot, they evermore,<BR>
Unarmed, in company with her had gone,<BR>
That hither came from her so distant shore.<BR>
I know not, I, if it was better done<BR>
Or worse, by her, that they their arms forbore;<BR>
Worse, touching her defence; but better far,<BR>
If they were losers in the doubtful war.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
For she would have been dragged,&#8212;like others, whom<BR>
Armed men had thither brought beneath their guide,<BR>
(Unhappy women) to the brothers&#8217; tomb,&#8212;<BR>
And by the sacrifice knife have died.<BR>
Death, sure, is worse, and more disastrous doom<BR>
Than showing that which modesty would hide;<BR>
And they who can to force ascribe the blame,<BR>
Extinguish this and every other shame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
Before they hence depart, the martial twain<BR>
Assemble the inhabitants, to swear,<BR>
They to their wives the rule of that domain<BR>
Will leave, as well as every other care;<BR>
And that they will chastise, with heavy pain,<BR>
Whoever to oppose this law shall dare.<BR>
&#8212;In fine, man&#8217;s privileges, whatsoe&#8217;er,<BR>
They swear, shall be conferred on woman here:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
Then make them promise never to bestow<BR>
Harbourage on whosoever thither sped,<BR>
Footman or cavalier, nor even allow<BR>
Any beneath a roof to hide his head,<BR>
Unless he swore by God and saints, or vow<BR>
Yet stronger made&#8212;if stronger could be said&#8212;<BR>
That he the sex&#8217;s cause would aye defend,<BR>
Foe to their foes, and woman&#8217;s faithful friend;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
And, if he then were wived, or ever were<BR>
&#8212;Sooner or later&#8212;linked in nuptial noose,<BR>
Still to his wife he would allegiance bear,<BR>
Nor e&#8217;er compliance with her will refuse.<BR>
Marphisa says, within the year, she there<BR>
Will be, and ere the trees their foliage lose;<BR>
And, save she find her statute in effect,<BR>
That borough fire and ruin may expect.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
Nor hence they part ill from the filthy place,<BR>
Wherein it lay, Drusilla&#8217;s corse is borne;<BR>
Her with her lord they in a tomb encase,<BR>
And, with what means the town supplies, adorn.<BR>
Drusilla&#8217;s ancient woman, in this space,<BR>
Marganor&#8217;s body with her goad has torn.<BR>
Who only grieves she has not wind enow,<BR>
No respite to his torture to allow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
Beside a church, the martial damsels twain<BR>
Behold a pillar, standing in the square;<BR>
Whereon the wicked lord of the domain<BR>
Had graved that mad and cruel law; the pair,<BR>
In imitation, his helm, plate, and chain,<BR>
And shield, in guise of trophy fasten there;<BR>
And afterwards upon the pillar trace<BR>
That law they had enacted for the place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
Within the town the troop set up their rest,<BR>
Until the law is graved, of different frame<BR>
From that before upon the stone imprest,<BR>
Which every woman doom&#8217;d to death and shame.<BR>
With the intention to replace her vest,<BR>
Here from that band divides the Islandick dame;<BR>
Who deems, at court &#8217;twere shameful to appear,<BR>
Unless adorned and mantled as whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
Here Ulany remained, and in her power<BR>
Remained the wicked tyrant Marganor:<BR>
She, lest he any how, in evil hour,<BR>
Should break his bonds and injure damsel more,<BR>
Made him, one day, leap headlong from a tower,<BR>
Who never took so still a leap before.<BR>
No more of her and hers! I of the crew<BR>
That journey toward Arles, the tale pursue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
Throughout all that and the succeeding day,<BR>
Till the forenoon, proceed those banded friends;<BR>
And, where the main-road branches, and one way<BR>
Towards the camp, to Arles the other tends,<BR>
Again embrace the lovers, and oft say<BR>
A last farewell, which evermore offends.<BR>
The damsels seek the camp; to Arles is gone<BR>
Rogero; and my canto I have done.</TD></TR>
