<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
By good Rogero and those paynims three<BR>
Defeated, Charlemagne to Paris flies.<BR>
Already all, throughout their chivalry,<BR>
Are mad with spite and hatred; jars arise,<BR>
And strife; and means to still their enmity<BR>
Their sovereign is unable to devise.<BR>
From him departs the monarch of Argier,<BR>
Who is rejected of his lady dear.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
A woman for the most part reasons best<BR>
Upon a sudden motion, and untaught;<BR>
For with that special grace the sex is blest,<BR>
&#8217;Mid those so many gifts, wherewith &#8217;tis fraught;<BR>
But man, of a less nimble wit possest,<BR>
Is ill at counsel, save, with sober thought,<BR>
He ruminates thereon, content to spend<BR>
Care, time and trouble to mature his end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
That seemed good counsel, but was ill indeed<BR>
Of Malagigi&#8217;s, as before was said;<BR>
Albeit he so rescued in his need<BR>
His cousin Richardet, with odds o&#8217;erlaid,<BR>
When from the paynim monarchs him he freed<BR>
By ready demon, who his hest obeyed;<BR>
For sure he never deemed they should be borne,<BR>
Where they would work the Christian army scorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Had he some little prize for counsel stayed,<BR>
(We with the same success may well suppose)<BR>
He to his cousin might have furnished aid,<BR>
Yet brought not on the Christian host their foes:<BR>
That evil sprite he might as well have made,<BR>
Him, who embodied in the palfrey goes,<BR>
Eastward or west, so far that lady bear,<BR>
That France should hear no further of the pair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
So the two lovers, following her who flies,<BR>
To other place than Paris might be brought:<BR>
But this calamity was a surprise<BR>
On Malagigi, through his little thought;<BR>
And fiendish malice, banished from the skies,<BR>
Which ever blood and fire and ravage sought,<BR>
Guided them by that way to Charles&#8217; disaster;<BR>
Left to his choice by him, the wizard master.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
The wayward fiend who makes that palfrey ramp<BR>
Bears off the frighted Doralice amain;<BR>
Nor river nor yet yawning ditch, or swamp,<BR>
Wood, rock, or rugged cliff, the steed restrain;<BR>
Till, traversing the French and English camp,<BR>
And other squadrons of the mingled train,<BR>
Beneath the holy flag of Christ arraid,<BR>
He to Granada&#8217;s king the fair conveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
The Sarzan and the Tartar the first day<BR>
That royal damsel a long while pursue;<BR>
Because her distant form they yet survey;<BR>
But finally they lose that lady&#8217;s view;<BR>
When, like a lyme-dog, whom the hunters lay<BR>
On hare or roebuck&#8217;s trail, the valiant two<BR>
Follow upon her track, nor halt, till told<BR>
That she is harboured in her father&#8217;s hold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Guard thyself, Charles: for, lo! against thee blown<BR>
Is such a storm, that I no refuge see:<BR>
Nor these redoubted monarchs come alone,<BR>
But those of Sericane and Circassy;<BR>
While Fortune, who would probe thee to the bone,<BR>
Has taken those two shining stars from thee,<BR>
Who kept thee by their wisdom and their light;<BR>
And thou remainest blind and wrapt in night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis of the valiant cousins I would speak:<BR>
Of these, Orlando of his wit bereft,<BR>
Naked, in sun or shower, by plain or peak,<BR>
Wanders about the world, a helpless weft;<BR>
And he, in wisdom little less to seek,<BR>
Rinaldo, in thy peril thee has left;<BR>
And, for in Paris-town she is not found,<BR>
In search of his Angelica is bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
A cunning, old enchanter him deceived,<BR>
As in the outlet of my tale was said:<BR>
Deluded by a phantom, he believed<BR>
Angelica was with Orlando fled;<BR>
And hence with jealousy, at heart, aggrieved<BR>
(Lover ne&#8217;er suffered worse) to Paris sped;<BR>
Whence he, as soon as he appeared at court,<BR>
By chance, was named to Britain to resort.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Now, the field won, wherein with mickle fame<BR>
He drove King Agramant his works behind,<BR>
To Paris yet again the warrior came,<BR>
Searched convent, tower, and house, and, save confined<BR>
&#8217;Twixt solid walls or columns be the dame,<BR>
Her will the restless lover surely find:<BR>
Nor her nor yet Orlando he descries,<BR>
So forth in the desire to seek them hies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Her to Anglantes or to Brava brought,<BR>
He deemed the Count enjoyed in mirth and play;<BR>
And vainly, here and there, that damsel sought,<BR>
Nor here nor there, descried the long-sought prey.<BR>
To Paris he repaired again, in thought<BR>
The paladin returning to waylay;<BR>
Because he deemed he could not rove at large<BR>
Without that Town, but on some special charge.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Within he takes a day or two&#8217;s repose;<BR>
And, when he finds Orlando comes not there,<BR>
Again to Brava and Anglantes goes<BR>
Inquiring tidings of the royal fair;<BR>
Nor, whether morning dawns or noontide glows,<BR>
&#8212;Nor night nor day&#8212;his weary steed does spare;<BR>
Nor once&#8212;but twice a hundred times&#8212;has run<BR>
The selfsame course, by light of moon or sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
But the ancient foe, deluded by whose say,<BR>
To the forbidden fruit Eve raised her hand,<BR>
Turned his wan eyes on Charlemagne one day,<BR>
When he the good Rinaldo absent scanned;<BR>
And seeing what foul rout and disarray<BR>
Might at that time be given to Charles&#8217;s band,<BR>
Of all the Saracens the choice and flower<BR>
Marshalled in arms against the Christian power.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
King Sacripant and King Gradasso (who<BR>
Whilere companionship in war had made,<BR>
When from Atlantes&#8217; palace fled the two)<BR>
Together to unite their arms, in aid<BR>
Of royal Agramant&#8217;s beleaguered crew,<BR>
And where through unknown lands the warriors hied,<BR>
Made smooth the way, and served them as a guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Thither another fiend that ruthless foe<BR>
Bade Rodomont and Mandricardo bear<BR>
Through ways, by which his comrade was not slow<BR>
With the affrighted Doralice to fare:<BR>
A third, lest they their enterprize forego,<BR>
Rogero and Marphisa has in care:<BR>
But their conductor journeys not so fast;<BR>
And hence that martial pair arrives the last.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Later by half an hour, against their foes,<BR>
So matched, Rogero and Marphisa speed;<BR>
Because the sable angel, who his blows<BR>
Aimed at the bands that held the Christian creed,<BR>
Provided, that the contest which arose<BR>
About that horse, his work should not impede;<BR>
Which had again been kindled, had the twain,<BR>
Rodomont and Rogero, met again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
The first four ride until themselves they find<BR>
Where the besiegers and besieged they view;<BR>
And see the banners shaking in the wind,<BR>
And the cantonments of those armies two.<BR>
Here they short counsel took, and next opined,<BR>
In spite of Charlemagne&#8217;s beleaguering crew,<BR>
To carry speedy succour to their liege,<BR>
And rescue royal Agramant from siege.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Where thickest camped lay Charles&#8217;s host, they spurred,<BR>
Closing their files against the Christian foe.<BR>
&#8220;Afric and Spain!&#8221; is the assailants&#8217; word,<BR>
Whom at all points the Franks for paynims know.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;To arms, to arms!&#8221; throughout their camp is heard:<BR>
But first is felt the Moorish sabre&#8217;s blow:<BR>
Even on the rear-guard falls the vengeful stroke,<BR>
Not charged alone, but routed, beat and broke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
The Christian host throughout is overthrown,<BR>
And how they know not, in tumultuous wise;<BR>
And that it is a wonted insult done<BR>
By Switzer or by Gascon, some surmise;<BR>
But&#8212;since the reason is to most unknown&#8212;<BR>
Each several nation to its standard flies,<BR>
This to the drum, that to the trumpet&#8217;s sound,<BR>
And shriek and shout from earth to heaven redound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
All armed is Charlemagne, except his head,<BR>
And, girt with paladins, his faithful stay,<BR>
Arrived demanding what alarm has bred<BR>
Disorder in his host and disarray;<BR>
And stopt with menace this or that who fled,<BR>
And many fugitives, upon their way,<BR>
Some with maimed face, breast, arm, or hand, espied,<BR>
And some with head or throat with life-blood dyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Advancing, he on earth saw many more,<BR>
Or rather in a lake of crimson laid,<BR>
Horribly weltering in their own dark gore,<BR>
Beyond the leech&#8217;s and magician&#8217;s aid;<BR>
And busts dissevered from the heads they bore,<BR>
And legs and arms&#8212;a cruel show&#8212;surveyed;<BR>
And, from the first cantonments to the last,<BR>
Saw slaughtered men on all sides as he past.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Where the small band advances in such wise,<BR>
Deserving well eternal praise to gain,<BR>
Vouching their deeds, a long-drawn furrow lies,<BR>
A signal record of their might and main.<BR>
His army&#8217;s cruel slaughter, with surprise,<BR>
Anger and rage, is viewed by Charlemagne.<BR>
So he whose shattered walls have felt its force,<BR>
Throughout his mansion tracks the lightning&#8217;s course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Not to the ramparts of the paynim crew<BR>
Of Agramant as yet had pierced this aid,<BR>
When, on the further side, these other two,<BR>
Rogero and Marphisa, thither made.<BR>
When, once or twice, that worthy pair a view<BR>
Have taken of the ground, and have surveyed<BR>
The readiest way assistance to afford,<BR>
They swiftly move in succour of their lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
As when we spark to loaded mine apply,<BR>
Through the long furrow, filled with sable grain,<BR>
So fast the furious wildfire darts, that eye<BR>
Pursues the progress of the flash with pain;<BR>
And as dire ruin follows, and from high,<BR>
The loosened rock and solid bastion rain,<BR>
So bold Rogero and Marphisa rush<BR>
To battle, so the Christian squadrons crush.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Front and askance, the assailants smote, and low<BR>
On earth heads, arms, and severed shoulders lay,<BR>
Where&#8217;er the Christian squadrons were too slow<BR>
To free the path and break their close array.<BR>
Whoe&#8217;er has seen the passing tempest blow,<BR>
And of the hill or valley, in its way,<BR>
One portion ravage and another leave,<BR>
May so their course amid that host conceive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Many who had escaped by quick retreat,<BR>
Rodomont and those other furious three,<BR>
Thank God that he had given them legs and feet,<BR>
Wherewith to fly from that calamity;<BR>
And from the Child and damsel new defeat<BR>
Encounter, while with endlong course they flee:<BR>
As man, no matter if he stands or run,<BR>
Seeks vainly his predestined doom to shun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Who &#8217;scape one peril, into other fly,<BR>
And pay the penalty of flesh and blood;<BR>
So, by the teeth of dog, is wont to die<BR>
The fox, together with her infant brood,<BR>
By one who dwells her ancient cavern nigh<BR>
Unearthed, and with a thousand blows pursued;<BR>
When from some unsuspected place, that foe<BR>
Has filled with fire and smoke the den below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa and the Child, of danger clear,<BR>
Enter the paynim ramparts; and, with eyes<BR>
Upturned, the Saracens, with humble cheer,<BR>
Thank Heaven for the success of that emprize:<BR>
The paladins no longer are their fear;<BR>
The meanest Moor a hundred Franks defies;<BR>
And &#8217;tis resolved, without repose, again<BR>
To drench with Christian blood the thirsty plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
At once a formidable larum rose;<BR>
Horns, drums, and shrilling clarions filled the skies;<BR>
And the wind ruffles, as it comes and goes,<BR>
Banner and gonfalon of various dyes.<BR>
The Germans and the warlike Bretons close;<BR>
Ranged on the other part, in martial wise,<BR>
Italians, English, French, were seen, and through<BR>
Those armies furious war blazed forth anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
The force of the redoubted Rodomont,<BR>
And that of Agrican&#8217;s infuriate son,<BR>
That of Rogero, valiant&#8217;s copious font,<BR>
Gradasso&#8217;s, so renowned for trophies won,<BR>
The martial maid, Marphisa&#8217;s fearless front,<BR>
And might of Sacripant, excelled by none,<BR>
Made Charles upon Saint John and Denys call,<BR>
And fly for shelter to his Paris wall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Of fierce Marphisa and her bold allies<BR>
The unconquered daring and the wondrous might,<BR>
Sir, was not of a nature&#8212;of a guise&#8212;<BR>
To be conceived, much less described aright:<BR>
The number slaughtered hence may you surmise!<BR>
What cruel blow King Charles sustained in fight!<BR>
Add to these warriors of illustrious name,<BR>
More than one Moor, with Ferrau, known to Fame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Many through reckless haste were drowned in Seine,<BR>
For all too narrow was the bridge&#8217;s floor,<BR>
An wished, like Icarus, for wings in vain,<BR>
Having grim death behind them and before,<BR>
Save Oliver, and Ogier hight the Dane,<BR>
The paladins are prisoners to the Moor:<BR>
Wounded beneath his better shoulder fled<BR>
The first, that other with a broken head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
And. like Orlando and Duke Aymon&#8217;s son,<BR>
Had faithful Brandimart thrown up the game,<BR>
Charles had from Paris into exile gone,<BR>
If he had scaped alive so fierce a flame.<BR>
Brandimart does his best, and when &#8217;tis done,<BR>
Yields to the storm: Thus Fortune, fickle dame,<BR>
Now smiles upon the paynim monarch, who<BR>
Besieges royal Charlemagne anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
From earth beneath the widow&#8217;s outcry swells,<BR>
Mingled with elder&#8217;s and with orphan&#8217;s prayer,<BR>
Into the pure serene, where Michael dwells,<BR>
Rising above this dim and troubled air;<BR>
And to the blest archangel loudly tells,<BR>
How the devouring wolf and raven tear<BR>
His faithful English, French, and German train,<BR>
Whose slaughtered bodies overspread the plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Red blushed the blessed angel, who believed<BR>
He ill obedience to his lord had paid;<BR>
And, in his anger, deemed himself deceived<BR>
By the perfidious Discord and betrayed:<BR>
He his Creator&#8217;s order had received<BR>
To stir the Moors to strife, nor had obeyed;<BR>
Had rather in their eyes who marked the event,<BR>
Appeared throughout to thwart his high intent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
As servant faithful to his lord, and more<BR>
In love than memory strong, who finds that he<BR>
Has that forgotten which at his heart-core,<BR>
As precious as his life and soul should be,<BR>
Hastes to repair his error, nor before<BR>
He mend that fault, again his lord will see,<BR>
So not to God St. Michael will ascend<BR>
Until he has achieved his holy end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Again he to that monastery flew,<BR>
Where whilom he had Discord seen; and there<BR>
Seated in chapter sees her, while anew<BR>
Their yearly officers elected are,<BR>
She taking huge delight those friers to view,<BR>
That at each other hurled their books of prayer.<BR>
His hand within her locks the archangel twists,<BR>
And deals her endless scathe with feet and fists.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
On her he next a cross&#8217;s handle broke;<BR>
Wherewith her back, and arms, and head he plies:<BR>
His mercy with loud voice the wretch bespoke,<BR>
And hugged that angel&#8217;s knees with suppliant cries.<BR>
Michael suspends not the avenging stroke<BR>
Till hunted to the Moorish camp she flies,<BR>
Then thus: &#8220;Believe worse vengeance yet in store,<BR>
If I beyond these lines behold thee more.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Albeit in back and arms all over shent<BR>
Was Discord by that angel, in her fear<BR>
Of suffering yet again such chastisement,<BR>
Such horrid fury and such blows severe,<BR>
She speedily to take her bellows went,<BR>
And, adding food to what she lit whilere,<BR>
And setting other ready piles afire,<BR>
Kindled in many hearts a blaze of ire;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
And good Rogero (she inflames them so)<BR>
With Rodomont and Mandricardo fares<BR>
To Agramant; and all (since now the foe<BR>
The paynims pressed no more, the vantage theirs)<BR>
To him the seed of their dissensions show,<BR>
And what the bitter produce which it bears:<BR>
Then to the judgment of the king refer<BR>
Who first in listed field his claim should stir.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
As well Marphisa to Troyano&#8217;s son,<BR>
Relates her case, and will conclude the fray<BR>
Which with the Tartar king she had begun,<BR>
Because by him provoked to that assay;<BR>
Nor will she yield her place to any one,<BR>
No, not a single hour, yet less a day;<BR>
But with loud instances maintains her right<BR>
With Mandricardo first to wage the fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
To have the first possession of the field<BR>
No less renowned king Rodomont contended,<BR>
Which he, the African array to shield,<BR>
Had interrupted and till now suspended.<BR>
Rogero to King Agramant appealed,<BR>
As having borne too long, though sore offended,<BR>
That Rodomont form him detained his horse,<BR>
Nor yet would meet him first in martial course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
The Tartar king, for more perplexity,<BR>
Denied on any ground Rogero&#8217;s right<BR>
The bearer of the white-winged bird to be;<BR>
And was so passing wood with wrath and spite,<BR>
That, if to this those others would agree,<BR>
He would at once those several quarrels fight;<BR>
And so those others would as well have done,<BR>
If Agramant&#8217;s consent they could have won.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
King Agramant, with prayer and kingly word,<BR>
Had willingly appeased that jarring crew;<BR>
But since the foes were deaf to all accord,<BR>
Nor would assent to peace or truce anew,<BR>
Considered how at least he might afford<BR>
The field of each of them in order due;<BR>
And, as the best resolve, at last decreed,<BR>
Each should by lot possess the listed mead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
Four lots the monarch bade prepare, which done,<BR>
This &#8220;Rodomont and Mandricardo&#8221; said;<BR>
&#8220;Rogero and Mandricardo&#8221; were in one;<BR>
In one, &#8220;Rogero and Rodomont&#8221; were read;<BR>
That &#8220;Mandricardo and Marphisa&#8221; run:<BR>
Next, as the fickle goddess, Fortune, led,<BR>
The lots are drawn, and in the first appear<BR>
The Tartar king and sovereign of Argier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Rogero and Mandricardo for that play<BR>
Were next; Rogero and Rodomont were third;<BR>
Marphisa&#8217;s lot and Mardricardo&#8217;s lay<BR>
At bottom; whence the dame was deeply stirred;<BR>
Nor young Rogero seems a whit more gay:<BR>
Who knows the prowess of those two preferred<BR>
Will nothing in the listed combat leave<BR>
For him or for Marphisa to achieve.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
There lies a place, of Paris little wide,<BR>
Covering a mile or somewhat less, and round;<BR>
Like ancient theatre, on every side,<BR>
Encompast by a tall and solid mound;<BR>
With castle whilom was it fortified,<BR>
Which sword and fire had levelled with the ground.<BR>
The Parmesan like circle does survey,<BR>
Whenever he to Borgo wends his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
In this place is prepared the listed mead,<BR>
Which palisades of little height inclose;<BR>
A square, of just proportions for that need,<BR>
With two capacious gates, as usage goes.<BR>
The day on which to combat have agreed<BR>
Those valiant knights, who will not balk their foes,<BR>
Beside the palisades, to left and right,<BR>
Facing each entrance, are pavilions pight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
In that, which looks towards the western sun,<BR>
Is lodged the giant monarch of Argier;<BR>
And him assist his serpent-hide to don<BR>
Bold Ferrau and Circassia&#8217;s cavalier.<BR>
Gradasso and the puissant Falsiron,<BR>
In that which fronts the morning hemisphere,<BR>
Clothe with their hands, in Trojan plate and chain,<BR>
The good successor of King Agricane.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
High on a throne of ample state appeared<BR>
Agramant and Marsilius; next in place<BR>
Were Stordilane and all the chiefs, revered<BR>
Throughout the squadrons of the paynim race.<BR>
Happy was he who found himself upreared<BR>
On mound or tree, above that level space.<BR>
Great was the throng, and round the palisade<BR>
On every side the eddying people swayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Were seated with the Queen of fair Castille<BR>
Queens, princesses, and dames of noble strain,<BR>
From Arragon, Granada, and Seville,<BR>
And Atlas&#8217; columns; and amid the train<BR>
Assembled to behold that fierce appeal,<BR>
Was placed the daughter of King Stordilane:<BR>
Two costly vests&#8212;one red, one green&#8212;she wore;<BR>
But ill the first was dyed, and faded sore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
In dress succinct Marphisa sate; in plight<BR>
Such as beseemed a warrior and a maid:<BR>
Thermodoon haply witnessed Hippolyte<BR>
And her fair squadron in like garb arrayed.<BR>
Afield already, in his livery dight,<BR>
Agramant&#8217;s herald made proclaim, and said<BR>
It was forbid to all men, far and wide,<BR>
In act or word, with either part to side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
The frequent crowd expects the double foe;<BR>
And often, in impatience, they complain,<BR>
And call those famous cavaliers too slow:<BR>
When from the Tartar&#8217;s tent an angry strain<BR>
Is heard, and cries which multiply; sir, know<BR>
It was the martial king of Sericane,<BR>
And puissant Tartar, who that question stirred,<BR>
And made the mighty tumult which has heard.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Sericane&#8217;s monarch, having with his hand<BR>
Equipt the king of Tartary all o&#8217;er,<BR>
Approached to gird him with that sovereign brand,<BR>
With which Orlando went adorned of yore.<BR>
When Durindana on the hilt he scanned,<BR>
Graved with the quartering that Almontes wore;<BR>
Which from that wretched man, beside a font,<BR>
Youthful Orlando reft in Aspramont.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
He, seeing this, agnised it for the blade<BR>
So famous, which Anglantes&#8217; warrior bore,<BR>
For which he had the fairest fleet arrayed<BR>
Which ever put to sea from eastern shore;<BR>
And had Castille&#8217;s rich kingdom overlaid,<BR>
And conquered fruitful France some years before;<BR>
But cannot now imagine how that sword<BR>
Is in possession of the Tartar lord;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
And asks had he by force or treaty won,<BR>
And when and where and how, that faulchion bright;<BR>
And Mandricardo said that he had done<BR>
Fierce battle for that sword with Brava&#8217;s knight;<BR>
Who feigned himself of sober sense foregone,<BR>
Hoping that so he should conceal his fright:<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;For I on him would ceaseless war have made,&#8221;<BR>
(He added) &#8220;while he kept the goodly blade.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Saying the Count, in yielding to his foe<BR>
That sword, the Beavers&#8217; known device had tried;<BR>
Who. followed closely by the hunter, know<BR>
Their fell pursuer covers nought beside.<BR>
Ere he had heard him out,&#8212;&#8220;Nor I forego<BR>
That sword to thee nor any one,&#8221; (replied<BR>
Gradasso, fierce,) &#8220;well earned by me, at cost<BR>
Of treasure, and of pain, and people lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Some other faulchion for thyself purvey;<BR>
This will I have; nor deem my reasons new;<BR>
Whether Orlando wise or foolish stray,<BR>
I make it mine where&#8217;er it meets my view.<BR>
With none to witness, thou, beside the way<BR>
Usurped that sword; I claim it as my due:<BR>
For this my scimeter shall reasons yield,<BR>
And we will try the cause in listed field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Prepare to win the sword before thou rear<BR>
That goodly blade against King Rodomont.<BR>
To win his arms is use of cavalier,<BR>
Before his foe in duel he affront.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;No sweeter music ever soothes my ear&#8221;<BR>
(Replied the Tartar, as he raised his front)<BR>
&#8220;Than voice which champions me to martial field;<BR>
But see that his consent the Sarzan yield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Be thou the first; and, next on listed ground<BR>
Let Sarza&#8217;s valiant lord the question try;<BR>
Nor doubt but I in readiness be found<BR>
To thee and every other to reply.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;&#8212;Thou shalt not so the ordered lots confound,<BR>
Or break our compact (was Rogero&#8217;s cry):<BR>
Either, first Rodomont shall take the field,<BR>
Or shall to me his right of battle yield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;It that be true Gradasso has averred,<BR>
That knight should win the arms he would assay,<BR>
Thou hast no title to my white-winged bird,<BR>
Save this from me thou first shalt bear away.<BR>
But since, forsooth, whilere I said the word,<BR>
I will not what I once pronounced unsay,<BR>
That mine shall be the second battle, so<BR>
That Argier&#8217;s monarch first affront his foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I will confuse the order of the field,<BR>
Throughout, if partially confused by thee;<BR>
Abandon will I not my blazoned shield,<BR>
Unless thou combat for it now with me.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Were one and the other Mars, for battle steeled,<BR>
(Replies enraged, the king of Tartary)<BR>
&#8220;Nor one nor the other&#8217;s might should make me waive<BR>
My title to that shield and goodly glaive&#8221;;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
And over mastered by his choler, flies<BR>
With a clenched fist at him of Sericane,<BR>
And smites him with his right-hand in such wise,<BR>
As makes him quit his hold of Durindane.<BR>
Gradasso bold was taken by surprise,<BR>
Not deeming him so furious and insane;<BR>
And, while he looked not to the Tartar lord,<BR>
Found himself robbed of good Orlando&#8217;s sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Fury and scorn Gradasso&#8217;s visage heats,<BR>
Which seems to flash with fire, at that disgrace;<BR>
And with more rage and pain his bosom beats,<BR>
In that &#8217;twas offered in such public place.<BR>
To draw his scimeter, the king retreats,<BR>
Intent upon revenge, some little space.<BR>
So Mandricardo on himself relies<BR>
Rogero he to fight, as well defies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Come on in arms against me, both combined,<BR>
And be King Rodomont the third!&#8221; (he said)<BR>
&#8220;Come Spain and Afric and all human kind;<BR>
Ne&#8217;er will I turn.&#8221; And he, at nought dismaid,<BR>
So saying, in his fury, sawed the wind<BR>
About him, with Almontes&#8217; noble blade,<BR>
Embraced his shield, and, full of choler, stood<BR>
Against Gradasso and Rogero good.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Leave me the care,&#8221; the fierce Gradasso cried,<BR>
&#8220;The phrensy of this madman to subdue.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Not so, by Heaven!&#8221; Rogero wroth replied,<BR>
&#8220;For I this field claim justly as my due.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Stand back!&#8221; and &#8220;stand thou back!&#8221; on either side<BR>
They shout; yet neither of the twain withdrew.<BR>
And thus among those three began a feud;<BR>
And thence some strange result would have ensued,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
If many had not interposed, and sought<BR>
With little wit their fury to restrain;<BR>
Who had well-nigh too dear the experience bought<BR>
Of saving others at their proper pain;<BR>
Nor to accord the world had ever brought<BR>
Those knights, but that the worthy king of Spain<BR>
Came thither with renowned Troyano&#8217;s heir;<BR>
Awed by whose sovereign presence all forbear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Agramant those contending warriors made<BR>
The cause of their so burning strife display;<BR>
Next earnestly bestirred himself, and prayed<BR>
Gradasso that he would, in courteous way,<BR>
Concede the Trojan Hector&#8217;s goodly blade<BR>
To Mandricardo, solely for that day,<BR>
Until the cruel fight was at an end,<BR>
Wherein he should with Rodomont contend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
While royal Agramant would peace restore,<BR>
And now with this and now with that conferred,<BR>
From the other tent, between the Sarzan Moor<BR>
And Sacripant, another strife was heard.<BR>
Valiant King Sacripant (as said before)<BR>
To equip Sir Rodomont himself bestirred,<BR>
And he and Ferrau had that champion drest<BR>
In his forefather Nimrod&#8217;s iron vest;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
And there had they arrived, where with his spume<BR>
The horse was making his rich bridle white:<BR>
I of the good Frontino speak, for whom<BR>
Rogero urged with yet unfelt despite.<BR>
King Sacripant, who plays the part of groom,<BR>
And has to bring afield the Sarzan knight,<BR>
Marks narrowly the courser&#8217;s gear and shoes,<BR>
And sell and furniture throughout reviews;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
And as his points and nimble parts, more near,<BR>
He, in this view, observes with better heed,<BR>
The youthful king, beyond all doubt, is clear<BR>
He sees his Frontilatte in that steed,<BR>
Him he of old had held so passing dear,<BR>
Whilom of such debates the fruitful seed;<BR>
And for whose loss, whilere he was so woe,<BR>
He evermore on foot resolved to go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
This from beneath him had Brunello borne<BR>
Before Albracca, on the very day<BR>
Angelica&#8217;s rare ring, and Roland&#8217;s horn,<BR>
And Balisarda he conveyed away,<BR>
With fierce Marphisa&#8217;s blade,&#8212;and on return<BR>
To Afric&#8212;to Rogero, from his prey,<BR>
Gave Balisarda and the courser, who<BR>
Was by the Child Frontino named anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Assured &#8217;twas no mistake, Circassia&#8217;s chief<BR>
Turned him about to Rodomont, and cried:<BR>
&#8220;Reft from me in Albracca, by a thief,<BR>
This horse is mine; which might be certified<BR>
By them whose words would warrant well belief:<BR>
But as my witnesses are distant wide,<BR>
If it be questioned, I will make it plain,<BR>
And will, with sword in hand, the truth maintain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet am I well contented, for that we<BR>
Have for these some few days together gone,<BR>
To lend him for to-day; since well I see,<BR>
That not without him could the fight be done;<BR>
But on condition, that the courser be<BR>
Acknowledged mine, and furnished as a loan:<BR>
Otherwise hope not for that horse, save first<BR>
Me, on this quarrel, thou in combat worst.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
The furious king of Argier, that in pride<BR>
Surpassed all knights that ever girt the sword,<BR>
Whose paragon, for heart and prowess tried,<BR>
Meseems no ancient histories record,<BR>
Cried: &#8220;Sacripant, if any one beside<BR>
Thyself, to me should utter such a word,<BR>
He should deem quickly, from its bitter fruit,<BR>
He from his birth would better have been mute.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But, for that fellowship in which we went,<BR>
(As thou hast said) together, I to show<BR>
Such patience and forbearance am content,<BR>
As warning thee, thy purpose to forego,<BR>
Until thou shalt have witnessed the event<BR>
Of strife between me and my Tartar foe:<BR>
When him I such example hope to make,<BR>
That thou shalt humbly say, &#8216;The courser take.&#8217; &#8220;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Fierce and enraged, replied Circassia&#8217;s peer,<BR>
&#8220;To play the churl with thee is courteous deed,<BR>
But I to thee repeat more plain and clear,<BR>
Thou ill wouldst aught design against that steed,<BR>
For, while I an avenging sabre rear,<BR>
This I prohibit thee, and, should it need,<BR>
And every better means of battle fail,<BR>
With thee for this would battle, tooth and nail.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
They from dispute proceed to ribaldry,<BR>
From words to blows; and through their mickle ire,<BR>
Fierce battle was inflamed, and blazed more high<BR>
Than ever lightly-kindled straw took fire.<BR>
King Rodomont is steeled in panoply;<BR>
Sacripant neither plate nor mail attire:<BR>
Yet so in fence is skilled that nimble lord,<BR>
He seems all over sheltered by his sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
No greater were the daring and the might<BR>
(Though infinite) which Rodomont displaid<BR>
Than the precaution and the nimble sleight<BR>
Which the Circassian summoned to his aid:<BR>
No mill-wheel ever turns with swifter flight<BR>
The circling stone by which the grain is brayed,<BR>
Than Sacripant at need moves foot or hand,<BR>
And shifts now here, now there his restless stand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
But Serpentine and Ferrau interfere:<BR>
They with drawn swords the twain asunder bore;<BR>
With them Grandonio was and Isolier,<BR>
And many other leaders of the Moor,<BR>
This was the tumult which was heard whilere<BR>
In the other tent, what time they laboured sore,<BR>
Rogero vainly to a peace to bring<BR>
With Tartary&#8217;s and Sericana&#8217;s king.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
This while some voice to Agramant the news<BR>
Reports aright, that Ulien&#8217;s might seed,<BR>
With Sacripant, Circassia&#8217;s king, pursues<BR>
A fierce and furious quarrel for the steed.<BR>
Agramant, whom so many jars confuse,<BR>
Exclaims to King Marsilius: &#8220;Take thou heed<BR>
That no worse evil mid these knights betide,<BR>
While for this new disorder I provide.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Rodomont reined his anger, and retired<BR>
Some deal, at his approaching sovereign&#8217;s view;<BR>
Nor less respect in Sacripant inspired<BR>
The Moorish monarch; of the furious two,<BR>
He with grave voice and royal mien inquired<BR>
What cause of strife such deadly discord blew;<BR>
And having searched their quarrel to the root,<BR>
Would fain accord them; but with little fruit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Circassia&#8217;s monarch would not, on his side,<BR>
Longer his horse to Argier&#8217;s lord allow,<BR>
Save humbly Rodomont to him applied,<BR>
That steed for this occasion to bestow.<BR>
To him Sir Rodomont, with wonted pride,<BR>
Returned for answer: &#8220;Neither Heaven nor thou<BR>
Shall make me recognize as gift or loan<BR>
What I with this good hand can make mine own.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
The king bade Sacripant explain his right,<BR>
And how that horse was taken from him sought;<BR>
And this from first to last Circassia&#8217;s knight<BR>
Rehearsed, and reddened as the tale he taught,<BR>
Relating to the king the robber&#8217;s sleight;<BR>
Who had surprised him overwhelmed with thought,<BR>
Upon four spears his courser&#8217;s saddle stayed,<BR>
And from beneath the naked horse conveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Marphisa, whom these cries, mid others, bring,<BR>
When of the robbery of the horse advised,<BR>
In visage is disturbed, remembering<BR>
How on that day her faulchion was surprised;<BR>
And when that courser (which equipt with wing<BR>
Appeared when flying her) she recognized;<BR>
And recognized as well&#8212;at first unknown&#8212;<BR>
The valiant king who filled Circassia&#8217;s throne.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
The others who stood round her, wont to hear<BR>
Brunello often boast of the deceit,<BR>
&#8217;Gan turn towards that wretch, and made appear<BR>
By open signs they knew him for the Cheat.<BR>
Marphisa who the subtle knave whilere<BR>
Suspected as the author of that feat,<BR>
Now questions this, now that, who all accord<BR>
In saying &#8217;twas Brunello stole her sword;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Who, well deserving as a fitting pain<BR>
To dangle from the gallows-tree in air,<BR>
By Agramant the crown of Tingitane<BR>
(An ill example) was preferred to wear.<BR>
This fires anew Marphisa&#8217;s old disdain,<BR>
Nor she from instant vengeance will forbear,<BR>
For this, as well as other shame and scorn<BR>
She on her road had from that caitiff born.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
A squire laced on her helmet, at her hest;<BR>
She wore the remnant of her armour sheen;<BR>
Nor without martial cuirass on her breast,<BR>
Find I, that she ten times was ever seen,<BR>
Even from the day when first that iron vest<BR>
Braced on her limbs the passing-valiant queen:<BR>
With helm on head, where, mid the highest rows,<BR>
Brunello sits among the first, she goes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Him by mid breast Marphisa griped amain,<BR>
And lifted up the losel from the ground;<BR>
As is rapacious eagle wont to strain<BR>
The pullet, in her talons circled round;<BR>
And bore him where the sons of King Troyane<BR>
Heard the two knights their jarring claims propound.<BR>
He who perceives himself in evil hands,<BR>
Aye weeps, and mercy of that maid demands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Above the universal noise and shout,<BR>
Which rose nigh equally on either side,<BR>
Brunello, who from all the crowd about<BR>
For pity now, and now for succour, cried,<BR>
So loud was heard, that of that ample rout<BR>
He gathered round himself the pressing tide.<BR>
Arrived before the Moorish army&#8217;s head,<BR>
To him with haughty mien Marphisa said:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This thief (said she), thy vassal, will I slay,<BR>
And with this hand of mine will knot the cord<BR>
About his neck; because the very day<BR>
He stole this courser, he purloined my sword.<BR>
But is there any one who deems I say<BR>
Amiss, let him stand forth and speak the word;<BR>
For I on him will prove, before thine eyes,<BR>
I have done right, and who gainsays me, lies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But because haply some one may pretend<BR>
I have till such a time of strife delayed<BR>
My vengeance, when such famous knights contend,<BR>
For three days shall the wretch&#8217;s doom be stayed;<BR>
In the mean time let him who would defend<BR>
That caitiff, come himself, or send him aid.<BR>
For afterwards, if none the deed prevent,<BR>
His carcass shall a thousand birds content.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I hence to yonder tower, which distant nigh<BR>
Three leagues, o&#8217;erlooks a little copse, repair,<BR>
But with one varlet in my company,<BR>
And with one waiting-maid; if any dare<BR>
Rescue the thief, let him come thither; I<BR>
Wait the approach of his defenders there.&#8221;<BR>
Thus she; and thither quickly wends her ways<BR>
Whither was said, nor any answer stays.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Held on the pommel grappled by his hair,<BR>
Brunello on Marphisa&#8217;s courser lies:<BR>
The caitiff weeps, and shrieking in despair,<BR>
On all in whom he hopes, for succour cries.<BR>
In such confusion is Troyano&#8217;s heir,<BR>
He sees no way through these perplexities;<BR>
And, that Marphisa thence Brunello bore<BR>
In such a guise, yet grieved the monarch more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Not that he loved the losel or esteemed,<BR>
Rather to him some time had borne despite;<BR>
And often had to hand the caitiff schemed,<BR>
Since he had forfeited the ring of might.<BR>
But here his honour touched the monarch deemed,<BR>
So that his visage reddened at the slight:<BR>
He would, in person, follow her at speed,<BR>
And to his utmost power avenge the deed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
But the wise king, Sobrino, who was by,<BR>
Him from the quest endeavoured to dissuade,<BR>
And that with his exalted majesty<BR>
Such enterprize were ill assorted said:<BR>
Although firm hope, nay full security,<BR>
He had to overcome that martial maid,<BR>
If he with pain subdued a woman, shame,<BR>
Rather than honour, would pursue his name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Small profit and much peril would succeed<BR>
From any fight he should with her maintain,<BR>
(And he advised him) as the better deed,<BR>
To leave that wretched caitiff to his pain;<BR>
And albeit but a simple nod should need<BR>
To free him, from that nod he should refrain.<BR>
In that the monarch would do ill to force<BR>
Even-handed Justice from her destined course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou to the fierce Marphisa may&#8217;st apply<BR>
To leave his trial (he pursued) to thee,<BR>
With promise, her in this to satisfy<BR>
And to suspend him from the gallows-tree:<BR>
And even should the maid thy prayer deny,<BR>
Let her in every wish contented be:<BR>
And rather than that she desert thy side,<BR>
Let her hang him and every thief beside.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Right willingly King Agramant gave way<BR>
To King Sobrino&#8217;s counsel sage and staid;<BR>
And let renowned Marphisa wend her way,<BR>
Nor scathed he, nor let scathe, that martial maid,<BR>
Neither endured that any her should pray;<BR>
And heaven knows with what courage he obeyed<BR>
That wise advice, to calm such ruder strife<BR>
And quarrel, as throughout his camp were rife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
At this mad Discord laughed, no more in fear<BR>
That any truce or treaty should ensue;<BR>
And scowered the place of combat there and here,<BR>
Nor could stand still, for pleasure at the view.<BR>
Pride gamboled and rejoiced with her compeer,<BR>
And on the fire fresh food and fuel threw,<BR>
And shouted so that Michael in the sky<BR>
Knew the glad sign of conquest in that cry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Paris-town rocked, and turbid ran the flood<BR>
Of Seine at that loud voice, that horrid roar;<BR>
And, so it echo rang in Arden&#8217;s wood,<BR>
Beasts left their caverns in that forest hoar.<BR>
Alp and Cevenne&#8217;s mountain-solitude,<BR>
And Blois, and Arles, and Rouen&#8217;s distant shore,<BR>
Rhine, Rhone, and Saone, and Garonne, heard the pest;<BR>
Scared mothers hugged their children to their breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
Five have set up their rest, resolved to be<BR>
The first their different quarrels to conclude:<BR>
And tangled so is one with other plea,<BR>
That ill Apollo&#8217;s self could judge the feud.<BR>
To unravel that first cause of enmity<BR>
The king began&#8212;the strife which had ensued,<BR>
Because of beauteous Doralice, between<BR>
The king of Scythia and her Algerine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
King Agramant oft moved, between the pair,<BR>
Now here now there, to bring them to accord;<BR>
Now there now here, admonishing that pair,<BR>
Like faithful brother and like righteous lord:<BR>
But when he found that neither would forbear,<BR>
Deaf and rebellious to his royal word,<BR>
Nor would consent that lady to forego,<BR>
The cause of strife, in favour of his foe,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
As his best lore, at length the monarch said,<BR>
And to obey his sentence both were fain;<BR>
That he who was by her preferred, should wed<BR>
The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane:<BR>
And that what was established on his head<BR>
Should not be changed, to either&#8217;s loss or gain.<BR>
The compromise was liked on either side,<BR>
Since either hoped she would for him decide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
The mighty king of Sarza, who long space<BR>
Before the Tartar, had loved Doralice,<BR>
(Who had preferred that sovereign to such grace<BR>
As modest lady may, nor do amiss)<BR>
Believed, when she past sentence on the case,<BR>
She must pronounce what would ensure his bliss.<BR>
Nor thus alone King Rodomont conceived,<BR>
But all the Moorish host with him believed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
All know what exploits wrought by him had been<BR>
For her in joust and war; they all unsound<BR>
And weak King Mandricardo&#8217;s judgment ween;<BR>
But he, who oft was with her on their round,<BR>
And oftener private with the youthful queen,<BR>
What time the tell-tale sun was under ground,<BR>
He, knowing well how sure he was to speed,<BR>
Laughed at the silly rabble&#8217;s idle creed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
They, after, ratify the king&#8217;s award,<BR>
Between his hands, and next the suitors twain<BR>
Before that damsel go, that on the sward<BR>
Fixing her downcast eyes, in modest vein,<BR>
Avows her preference of the Tartar lord;<BR>
At which sore wondering stand the paynim train;<BR>
And Rodomont remains so sore astound,<BR>
He cannot raise his visage from the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
But wonted anger chasing shame which dyed<BR>
The Sarzan&#8217;s face all over, he arraigned<BR>
The damsel&#8217;s sentence, of the faulchion, tied<BR>
About his manly waist, the handle strained,<BR>
And in the king&#8217;s and others&#8217; hearing cried:<BR>
&#8220;By this the question shall be lost or gained;<BR>
And not by faithless woman&#8217;s fickle thought,<BR>
Which thither still inclines, where least it ought.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
Kind Mandricardo on his feet once more,<BR>
Exclaims, &#8220;And be it as it pleases thee.&#8221;<BR>
So that ere yet the vessel made the shore<BR>
Unploughed remained a mighty space of sea;<BR>
But that this king reproved the Sarzan sore,<BR>
Ruling that to appeal upon that plea<BR>
No more with Mandricardo could avail,<BR>
And made the moody Sarzan strike his sail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
Branded with double scorn, before those peers,<BR>
By noble Agramant, whose sovereign sway<BR>
He, as in loyal duty bound, reveres,<BR>
And by his lady on the selfsame day,<BR>
There will no more the monarch of Algiers<BR>
Abide, but of his band&#8212;a large array&#8212;<BR>
Two serjeants only for his service takes,<BR>
And with that pair the paynim camp forsakes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
As the afflicted bull who has foregone<BR>
His heifer, nor can longer warfare wage,<BR>
Seeks out the greenwood-holt and stream most lone,<BR>
Or sands at distance from his pasturage;<BR>
There ceases not, in sun or shade to moan;<BR>
Yet not for that exhales his amorous rage:<BR>
So parts, constrained his lady to forego,<BR>
The king of Argier, overwhelmed with woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
Rogero moved, his courser to regain,<BR>
And had already donned his warlike gear,<BR>
Then recollecting, that on listed plain<BR>
At Mandricardo he must couch the spear,<BR>
Followed not Rodomont, but turned his rein,<BR>
To end his quarrel with the Tartar, ere<BR>
He met in combat Sericana&#8217;s lord<BR>
Within close barriers, for Orlando&#8217;s sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
To have Frontino ravished in his sight,<BR>
And be unable to forbid the deed,<BR>
He sorely grieves; but, when he shall that fight<BR>
Have done, resolves he will regain the steed;<BR>
But Sacripant, whom, like the youthful knight,<BR>
No quarrels in the Moor&#8217;s pursuit impede,<BR>
And who was unengaged in other quest,<BR>
Upon the Sarzan&#8217;s footsteps quickly prest;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
And would have quickly joined him that was gone,<BR>
But for the chance of an adventure rare;<BR>
Which him detained until the day was done,<BR>
And made him lose the track of Ulien&#8217;s heir:<BR>
A woman who had fallen into the Saone,<BR>
And who without his help had perished there,<BR>
The warrior drowning in that water found,<BR>
And stemmed the stream and dragged the dame aground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
When afterwards he would remount the sell,<BR>
From him his restless charger broke astray,<BR>
Who fled before his lord till evening fell,<BR>
Nor lightly did the king that courser stay.<BR>
At last he caught him; but no more could spell<BR>
Where he had wandered from the beaten way:<BR>
Two hundred miles he roved, &#8217;twixt hill and plain,<BR>
Ere he came up with Rodomont again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
How he by Sacripant was overtaken,<BR>
And fought by him, to his discomfit sore,<BR>
And how he lost his courser, how was taken,<BR>
I say not now, who have to say before,<BR>
With what disdain and with what anger shaken,<BR>
Against his liege and love, the Sarzan Moor<BR>
Forth from the Saracen cantonments sped,<BR>
And what he of the one and other said.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
Wherever that afflicted paynim goes,<BR>
He fills the kindling air with sighs that burn;<BR>
And Echo oft, for pity of his woes,<BR>
With him from hollow rock is heard to mourn:<BR>
&#8220;O female mind! how lightly ebbs and flows<BR>
Your fickle mood,&#8221; (he cries,) &#8220;aye prone to turn!<BR>
Object most opposite to kindly faith!<BR>
Lost, wretched man, who trusts you to his scathe!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Neither my love nor length of servitude,<BR>
Though by a thousand proofs to you made clear,<BR>
Had power even so to fix your faithless mood,<BR>
That you at least so lightly should not veer:<BR>
Nor am I quitted, because less endued<BR>
With worth than Mandricardo I appear;<BR>
Nor for your conduct cause can I declare,<BR>
Save this alone, that you a woman are.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I think that nature and an angry God<BR>
Produced thee to the world, thou wicked sex,<BR>
To be to man a plague, a chastening rod;<BR>
Happy, wert thou not present to perplex.<BR>
So serpent creeps along the grassy sod;<BR>
So bear and ravening wolf the forest vex;<BR>
Wasp, fly, and gad-fly buzz in liquid air,<BR>
And the rich grain lies tangled with the tare.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Why has not bounteous Nature willed that man<BR>
Should be produced without the aid of thee,<BR>
As we the pippin, pear, and service can<BR>
Engraft by art on one another&#8217;s tree?<BR>
But she directs not all by certain plan;<BR>
Rather, upon a nearer view, I see,<BR>
In naming her, she ill can act aright,<BR>
Since Nature is herself a female hight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet be not therefore proud and full of scorn<BR>
Women, because man issues from your seed;<BR>
For roses also blossom on the thorn,<BR>
And the fair lily springs from loathsome weed.<BR>
Despiteous, proud, importunate, and lorn<BR>
Of love, of faith, of counsel, rash in deed,<BR>
With that, ungrateful, cruel and perverse,<BR>
And born to be the world&#8217;s eternal curse!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
These plaints and countless others to the wind<BR>
Poured forth the paynim knight, to fury stirred;<BR>
Now easing in low tone his troubled mind,<BR>
And now in sounds which were at distance heard,<BR>
In shame and in reproach of womankind;<BR>
Yet certes he from sober reason erred:<BR>
For we may deem a hundred good abound,<BR>
Where one or two perchance are evil found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
Though none for whom I hitherto have sighed<BR>
&#8212;Of those so many&#8212;have kept faith with me,<BR>
All with ingratitude, or falsehood dyed<BR>
I deem not, I accuse my destiny.<BR>
Many there are, and have been more beside<BR>
Unmeriting reproach: but if there be,<BR>
&#8217;Mid hundreds, one or two of evil way,<BR>
My fortune wills that I should be their prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
Yet will I make such search before I die,<BR>
Rather before my hair shall wax more white,<BR>
That haply on some future day, even I<BR>
Shall say, &#8220;That one has kept her promise plight.&#8221;<BR>
And should not the event my trust belie,<BR>
(Nor am I hopeless) I with all my might<BR>
Will with unwearied pain her praise rehearse<BR>
With pen and ink and voice, in prose and verse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
The Saracen, whom rage no less profound<BR>
Against his sovereign lord than lady swayed,<BR>
And who of reason thus o&#8217;erpast the bound,<BR>
And ill of one and of the other said,<BR>
Would fain behold that monarch&#8217;s kingdom drowned<BR>
With such a tempest, with such scathe o&#8217;erlaid,<BR>
As should in Africk every house aggrieve,<BR>
Nor one stone standing on another leave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
And would that from his realm, in want and woe,<BR>
King Agramant a mendicant should wend;<BR>
That through his means the monarch, brought thus low,<BR>
His fathers&#8217; ancient seat might reascend:<BR>
And thus he might the fruit of fealty show,<BR>
And make his sovereign see, a real friend<BR>
Was aye to be preferred in wrong or right,<BR>
Although the world against him should unite;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
And thus the Saracen pours forth his moan,<BR>
With rage against his liege and love possest;<BR>
And on his way is by long journeys gone,<BR>
Giving himself and courser little rest.<BR>
The following day or next, upon the Saone<BR>
He finds himself, who has his course addrest<BR>
Towards the coast of Provence, with design<BR>
To his African domain to cross the brine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
From bank to bank the stream was covered o&#8217;er<BR>
With boat of little burden, which conveyed,<BR>
For the supply of the invading Moor,<BR>
Victual, from many places round purveyed:<BR>
Since even from Paris to the pleasant shore<BR>
Of Acquamorta, all his rule obeyed;<BR>
And&#8212;fronting Spain&#8212;whate&#8217;er of level land<BR>
Was seen, extending on the better hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
The victual, disembarked from loaded barge,<BR>
Was laid on sumpter-horse or ready wain;<BR>
And sent, with escort to protect the charge,<BR>
Where barges could not come; about the plain,<BR>
Fat herds were feeding on the double marge,<BR>
Brought thither from the march of either reign;<BR>
And, by the river-side, at close of day,<BR>
In different homesteads lodged, the drovers lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
The king of Argier (for the dusky air<BR>
Of night began upon the world to close)<BR>
Here listened to a village-landlord&#8217;s prayer,<BR>
That in his inn besought him to repose.<BR>
&#8212;His courser stalled&#8212;the board with plenteous fare<BR>
Is heaped, and Corsic wine and Grecian flows;<BR>
For, in all else a Moor, the Sarzan drank<BR>
Of the forbidden vintage like a Frank.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
To warlike Rodomont, with goodly cheer<BR>
And kindlier mien, the landlord honour paid;<BR>
For he the port of an illustrious peer<BR>
In his guest&#8217;s lofty presence saw pourtrayed.<BR>
But, sore beside himself, the cavalier<BR>
Had scarce his heart within him, which had strayed<BR>
To her&#8212;whilere his own&#8212;in his despite;<BR>
Nor word escaped the melancholy knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
Mine host, most diligent in his vocation<BR>
Of all the trade who throughout France were known,<BR>
(In that he had, &#8217;mid strange and hostile nation,<BR>
And every chance of warfare, kept his own)<BR>
&#8212;Prompt to assist him in his occupation,<BR>
Some of his kin had called; whereof was none<BR>
Who dared before the warrior speak of aught,<BR>
Seeing that paynim mute and lost in thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
From thought to thought the Sarzan&#8217;s fancy flies,<BR>
Himself removed from thence a mighty space,<BR>
Who sits so bent, and with such downcast eyes,<BR>
He never once looks any in the face.<BR>
Next, after silence long, and many sighs,<BR>
As if deep slumber had but then given place,<BR>
His spirits he recalls, his eyelids raises,<BR>
And on the family and landlord gazes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Then silence broke, and with a milder air,<BR>
And visage somewhat less disturbed, applied<BR>
To him, the host, and those by-standers there,<BR>
To know if any to a wife were tied;<BR>
And landlord and attendants,&#8212;that all were,<BR>
To Sarza&#8217;s moody cavalier replied:<BR>
He asked what each conceited of his spouse,<BR>
And if he deemed her faithful to her vows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXV.</TD><TD>
Except mine host, those others were agreed<BR>
That chaste and good their consorts they believed.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Think each man as he will, but well I read,&#8221;<BR>
(The landlord said,) &#8220;You fondly are deceived:<BR>
Your rash replies to one conclusion lead,<BR>
That you are all of common sense bereaved;<BR>
And so too must believe this noble knight,<BR>
Unless he would persuade us black is white.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Because, as single is that precious bird<BR>
The phoenix, and on earth there is but one,<BR>
So, in this ample world, it is averred,<BR>
One only can a woman&#8217;s treason shun.<BR>
Each hopes alike to be that wight preferred,<BR>
The victor who that single palm has won.<BR>
&#8212;How is it possible that what can fall<BR>
To one alone, should be the lot of all?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Erewhile I made the same mistake as you,<BR>
And that more dames than one were virtuous thought,<BR>
Until a gentleman of Venice, who,<BR>
For my good fortune, to this inn was brought,<BR>
My ignorance by his examples true<BR>
So ably schooled, he better wisdom taught.<BR>
Valerio was the name that stranger bore;<BR>
A name I shall remember evermore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of wives and mistresses the treachery<BR>
Was known to him, with all their cunning lore.<BR>
He, both from old and modern history,<BR>
And from his own, was ready with such store,<BR>
As plainly showed that none to modesty<BR>
Could make pretension, whether rich or poor;<BR>
And that, if one appeared of purer strain,<BR>
&#8217;Twas that she better hid her wanton vein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He of his many tales, among the rest,<BR>
(Whereof a third is from my memory gone)<BR>
So well one story in my head imprest,<BR>
It could not be more firmly graved in stone:<BR>
And what I thought and think, would be professed<BR>
For that ill sex, I ween by every one<BR>
Who heard; and, Sir&#8212;if pleased to lend an ear&#8212;<BR>
To their confusion yon that tale shall hear.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What could&#8217;st thou offer which could better please<BR>
At present&#8221; (made reply the paynim knight)<BR>
&#8220;Than sample, chosen from thine histories,<BR>
Which hits the opinion that I hold, aright?<BR>
That I may hear thee speak with better ease<BR>
Sit so, that I may have thee in my sight.&#8221;<BR>
But in the following canto I unfold<BR>
What to King Rodomont the landlord told.</TD></TR>
