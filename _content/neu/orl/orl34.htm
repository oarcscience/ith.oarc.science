<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
In the infernal pit Astolpho hears<BR>
Of Lydia&#8217;s woe, by smoke well-nigh opprest.<BR>
He mounts anew, and him his courser bears<BR>
To the terrestrial paradise addrest.<BR>
By John advised in all, to heaven he steers;<BR>
Of some of his lost sense here repossest,<BR>
Orlando&#8217;s wasted wit as well he takes,<BR>
Sees the Fates spin their threads, and earthward makes.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
O fierce and hungry harpies, that on blind<BR>
And erring Italy so full have fed!<BR>
Whom, for the scourge of ancient sins designed,<BR>
Haply just Heaven to every board has sped.<BR>
Innocent children, pious mothers, pined<BR>
With hunger, die, and see their daily bread,<BR>
&#8212;The orphan&#8217;s and the widow&#8217;s scanty food&#8212;<BR>
Feed for a single feast that filthy brood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Too foul a fault was his, who did unclose<BR>
That cave long shut, and made the passage free,<BR>
From whence that greediness, that filth arose,<BR>
Our Italy&#8217;s infection doomed to be.<BR>
Then was good life extinguished, and repose<BR>
So banished, that with strife and poverty,<BR>
With fear and trouble, is she still perplext,<BR>
And shall for many a future year be vext:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Till she her sons has shaken by the hair,<BR>
And from Lethaean sloth to life restored;<BR>
Exclaiming, &#8220;Will none imitate that pair,<BR>
Zethes and Calais, with avenging sword<BR>
Rescue from claws and stench our goodly fare,<BR>
And cleanse and glad anew the genial board.<BR>
As they king Phineus from those fowls released,<BR>
And England&#8217;s peer restored the Nubian&#8217;s feast?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Hunting those hideous birds, that cavalier<BR>
Aye scared them with the bugle&#8217;s horrid sound;<BR>
Till at the mountain-cave his long career<BR>
He closed, and ran the monstrous troop to ground:<BR>
Attentive to the vent he held his ear,<BR>
And in that troubled cavern heard rebound,<BR>
Weeping and wailing, and eternal yell;<BR>
Proof certain that its entrance led to hell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Astolpho doubts if he within shall wend,<BR>
And see those wretched ones expelled from day;<BR>
Into the central pit of earth descend,<BR>
And the infernal gulfs around survey.<BR>
&#8220;Why should I fear, that on my horn depend<BR>
For certain succour?&#8221; (did the warrior say)<BR>
&#8220;Satan and Pluto so will I confound,<BR>
And drive before me their three-headed hound.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
He speedily his winged horse forsook;<BR>
(Him to a sapling near at hand he ties)<BR>
The cavern entered next; but first he took<BR>
His horn, whereon the knight in all relies.<BR>
Not far has he advanced before a smoke,<BR>
Obscure and foul, offends his nose and eyes.<BR>
Ranker than pitch and sulphur is the stench,<BR>
Yet not thereat does good Astolpho blench.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
But as he more descends into that lair,<BR>
So much he finds the smoke and vapour worse;<BR>
And it appears he can no further fare;<BR>
Nay, backward must retrace his way parforce.<BR>
Lo! something (what he knows not) he in air<BR>
Espies, that seems in motion, like a corse,<BR>
Upon whose wasted form long time had beat<BR>
The winter&#8217;s rain and summers scorching heat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
In that dim cavern was so little light,<BR>
&#8212;Yea, well-nigh might be said that light was none&#8212;<BR>
Nought sees or comprehends the English knight<BR>
What wavers so, above that vapour dun:<BR>
For surer proof, a stroke or two would smite<BR>
With his good faulchion Otho&#8217;s valiant son:<BR>
Then deemed that duke it was a spirit, whom<BR>
He seemed to strike amid the misty gloom.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
When him a melancholy voice addressed;<BR>
&#8220;Ah! without harming other, downward wend.<BR>
Me but too sore the sable fumes molest,<BR>
Which hither form the hellish fires ascend.&#8221;<BR>
Thereat the duke, amazed, his steps represt,<BR>
And to the spirit cried: &#8220;So may Heaven send<BR>
A respite from the vapours that exhale,<BR>
As thou shalt deign to tell thy mournful tale!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And to be known on earth shouldst thou be fain,<BR>
Thee will I satisfy.&#8221; To him the sprite:<BR>
So sweet it seems to me, in fame again<BR>
Thus to return into the glorious light,<BR>
My huge desire such favour to obtain,<BR>
Forces my words from me in my despite,<BR>
Constraining me to tell the things ye seek;<BR>
Though &#8217;tis annoyance and fatigue to speak.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lydia, the child of Lydia&#8217;s king, am I,<BR>
To proud estate and princely honours born,<BR>
Condemned by righteous doom of God on high<BR>
In murky smoke eternally to mourn:<BR>
Because a kindly lover&#8217;s constancy<BR>
I, while I lived, repaid with spite and scorn.<BR>
With countless others swarm these grots below,<BR>
For the same sin, condemned to the same woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Yet lower down, harsh Anaxarete<BR>
Suffers worse pain where thicker fumes arise;<BR>
Heaven changed her flesh to stone, and here to be<BR>
Tormented, her afflicted spirit sties:<BR>
In that unmoved she, hung in air, could see<BR>
A lover vest by her barbarities.<BR>
Here Daphne learns how rashly she had done<BR>
In having given Apollo such a run.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of hosts of ingrate women in this cell<BR>
Confined, it would be tedious to recite,<BR>
If, one by one, I upon these should dwell;<BR>
So many, their amount is infinite.<BR>
&#8217;Twould be more tedious of the men to tell,<BR>
Whose base ingratitude due pains requite;<BR>
And whom, in a more dismal prison pent,<BR>
Smoke blinds, and everlasting fires torment.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Since to belief soft woman is more prone,<BR>
He that deceives her, merits heavier pain;<BR>
To Theseus and to Jason this is known,<BR>
And him that vexed of old the Latian reign,<BR>
And him that of his brother Absalon<BR>
Erewhile provoked the pestilent disdain,<BR>
Because of Thamar; countless is the horde<BR>
Of those who left a wife or wedded lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But, rather of my state than theirs to shew,<BR>
And sin which brought me hither:&#8212;I was fair,<BR>
But so much haughtier was than fair of hue,<BR>
I know not if I ever equalled were:<BR>
Nor which was most excessive of the two,<BR>
My pride of beauty, could to thee declare.<BR>
Though it is certain, Pride but took its rise<BR>
In that rare loveliness which pleased all eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;There lived a Thracian knight, for warlike skill<BR>
And prowess, upon earth without a peer;<BR>
Who, voiced by many a worthy witness still,<BR>
The praises of my matchless charms did hear.<BR>
So that, of forethought and his own free will,<BR>
Fixed all his love on me that cavalier;<BR>
Weening this wife that I, upon my part,<BR>
Should for his valour duly prize his heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He came to Lydia, and by faster tie<BR>
Was fettered at my sight; and there enrolled<BR>
Amid my royal father&#8217;s chivalry,<BR>
In mickle fame increased that baron bold.<BR>
His feats of many a sort, and valour high<BR>
Would make a tale too tedious to be told;<BR>
With what his boundless merit had deserved,<BR>
If a more grateful master he had served.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Pamphylia, Caria, and Cilicia&#8217;s reign,<BR>
Through him, my father brought beneath his sway,<BR>
Who never moved a-field his martial train,<BR>
But when that warrior pointed out the way:<BR>
He, when he deemed he had deserved such gain,<BR>
Pressed close the Lydian king, upon a day,<BR>
And craved me from the monarch as his wife,<BR>
As meed of all that booty made in strife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Rejected of the monarch was the peer,<BR>
Who was resolved his child should highly wed;<BR>
Not him who was a simple cavalier;<BR>
Who, saving valour, was with nought bested.<BR>
For on my father, bent on gain and gear<BR>
And avarice, of all vice the fountain-head,<BR>
Manners and merit for as little pass,<BR>
As the lute&#8217;s music on the lumpish ass.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alcestes, he of whom I speak (so hight<BR>
That warrior), when he sees his suit denied,<BR>
Repulsed by one, by whom he had most right<BR>
To think that he should most be gratified,<BR>
Craves his discharge, and threatens he this slight<BR>
Will make the Lydian monarch dear abide.<BR>
The Armenian, an old rival of my sire,<BR>
And mortal for, he sought with this desire;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And so the monarch urged, he made him rear<BR>
His banner, and attack my sire; and, through<BR>
His famous feats, that Thracian cavalier<BR>
Was named the captain of the invading crew.<BR>
For the Armenian sovereign, far and near,<BR>
All things (so said the knight) he would subdue;<BR>
But claiming as his share, when all was won,<BR>
My sovereign beauties for the service done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I ill to you the mischief could express<BR>
Alcestes did us in that war; o&#8217;erthrown<BR>
By him four armies were, and he in less<BR>
Than one short twelvemonth left us neither town,<BR>
Not tower, save one, where cliffs forbade access:<BR>
&#8217;Twas here my sire, amid those of his own<BR>
Whom most he loved, took refuge, in his need,<BR>
With all the wealth he could collect with speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Us in this fortilage the knight attacked,<BR>
And shortly to such desperation drave,<BR>
That gladly would the king have made a pact,<BR>
To yield me for his consort, yea his slave,<BR>
With half our realm, if certain by that act<BR>
Himself from every other loss to save;<BR>
Right sure he otherwise should forfeit all,<BR>
And, after, die in bonds, a captive thrall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Before this happened, to try every way<BR>
Of remedy the Lydian king was bent;<BR>
And thither, where Alcestes&#8217; army lay,<BR>
Me, the first cause of all the mischief, sent.<BR>
To yield my person to him as a prey<BR>
I with intention to Alcestes went;<BR>
To bid him take what portion of our reign<BR>
He pleased, and pacify his fierce disdain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When of my coming that good knight does know,<BR>
Me he encounters pale and trembling sore:<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem a vanquished man&#8217;s a prisoner&#8217;s brow,<BR>
He, rather than a victor&#8217;s semblance, bore.<BR>
I who perceive he loves, address not now<BR>
The warrior as I was resolved before.<BR>
My vantage I descry, and shift my ground,<BR>
To fit the state wherein that knight was found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To curse the warrior&#8217;s passion I begun,<BR>
And of his crying cruelty complained,<BR>
Since foully by my father had he done,<BR>
And me would have by violence constrained;<BR>
Who with more grace my person would have won,<BR>
Nor waited many days, had he maintained<BR>
His course of courtship, as begun whilere.<BR>
To king and all of us so passing dear;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if the honest suit he hoped to gain<BR>
Had been at first rejected by my sire,<BR>
&#8217;Twas, he was somedeal of a churlish vein,<BR>
Nor ever yielded to a first desire;<BR>
He should not therefore, restive to the rein,<BR>
Have left his goodly task, so prompt to ire;<BR>
Sure, passing aye from good to better deed,<BR>
In little time to win the wished-for meed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if my father would not have been won,<BR>
To him I would so earnestly have prayed,<BR>
That he my lover should have made his son;<BR>
Nay, had my royal sire my suit gainsayed,<BR>
For him in secret that I would have done,<BR>
Wherewith he should have deemed himself appaid:<BR>
But since, it seemed, he other means designed,<BR>
Never to love him had I fixed my mind;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, though I sought him, at my father&#8217;s hest,<BR>
And pious love for him had been my guide,<BR>
He might be sure, not long should be possest<BR>
The bliss that I, in my despite, supplied;<BR>
For the red blood should issue from my breast<BR>
As soon as his ill will was satisfied<BR>
On this my wretched person, which alone<BR>
He so by brutal force should make his own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With these, and words like these, I moved the peer,<BR>
When I such puissance in myself espied;<BR>
And him so contrite made, in desert drear,<BR>
Was never seen a saint more mortified.<BR>
Before my feet the doleful cavalier<BR>
Fell down, and snatched a poniard from his side;<BR>
Which, he protested, I parforce should take,<BR>
And for so foul a sin my vengeance slake.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To push my mighty victory to an end<BR>
I scheme, when him I see in such distress,<BR>
And give him hopes he may even yet pretend<BR>
That I deservedly his love should bless,<BR>
If he his ancient error will amend,<BR>
Will of his realm my father repossess,<BR>
And will in future time deserve my charms<BR>
By love and service, not by force of arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So promised he to do; and set me free,<BR>
And let me, as I came, untouched, depart;<BR>
Nor even to kiss my lips he ventured; see<BR>
If he is yoked securely, if his heart<BR>
Love has well touched with the desire of me,<BR>
If he for him need feather other dart!<BR>
He seeks the Armenian, why by pact should take<BR>
Whatever spoil the conquering armies make;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And him, as best he might, would fain persuade<BR>
To leave to Lydia&#8217;s monarch his domain,<BR>
Upon whose wasted lands his host had preyed,<BR>
And rest content with his Armenian reign.<BR>
&#8212;He would not hear of this (the monarch said,<BR>
With cheers with fury swolen) nor would refrain<BR>
From pressing Lydia&#8217;s king with armed band,<BR>
So long as he possessed a palm of land;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if the knight, when a vile woman sues,<BR>
His purpose shift, let him the evil bear:<BR>
He will not, for the warrior&#8217;s asking, lose<BR>
What he has hardly conquered in a year.<BR>
Alcestes to the king his suit renews,<BR>
And next complains, that he rejects his prayer.<BR>
At length the Thracian fires, and threatens high,<BR>
By love or force the monarch shall comply.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So kindling anger waxed between the two,<BR>
It urged them from ill words to worser deed:<BR>
Upon the king his sword Alcestes drew;<BR>
Though thousands aid the monarch in his need,<BR>
And, in despite of all, their sovereign slew;<BR>
And made that day as well the Armenian bleed,<BR>
Backed by the Thracians&#8217; and Cilicians&#8217; aid<BR>
And other followers, by the warrior paid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His conquest he pursued, and, at his cost,<BR>
Without expense to us, in less than one<BR>
Short month, the kingdom by my father lost<BR>
Restored; and, to repair the mischief done,<BR>
(Beside spoil given) he conquered with his host,<BR>
&#8212;Taxing or taking what his arms had won&#8212;<BR>
Armenia and Cappadocia which confine;<BR>
And scowered Hyrcania to the distant brine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Him not to greet with triumphs, but to slay,<BR>
Returning from that warfare, we intend;<BR>
But, fearing failure, our design delay<BR>
In that we find too many him befriend.<BR>
Feeding him aye with hope from day to day,<BR>
I for the Thracian warrior love pretend:<BR>
But first declare my will that he oppose<BR>
And prove his valour on our other foes;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And him, now sole, now ill accompanied,<BR>
On strange and perilous emprize I speed;<BR>
Wherein a thousand knights might well have died;<BR>
But all things happily with him succeed:<BR>
For Victory was ever on his side;<BR>
And oft with horrid foes of monstrous breed,<BR>
With Giants and with Lestrigons, who brought<BR>
Damage in our domains, the warrior fought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Nor Juno, nor Eurystheus, in such chase<BR>
Ever renowned Alcides vext so sore,<BR>
In Erymanth, Nemaea, Lerna, Thrace,<BR>
Aetolia, Africa, by Tyber&#8217;s shore,<BR>
By Ebro&#8217;s sunny bank, or other place,<BR>
As (hiding murderous hate, while I implore)<BR>
I exercise my lover still in strife,<BR>
With the same fell design upon his life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Unable to achieve my first intent,<BR>
I on a scheme of no less mischief fall:<BR>
Through me, all deemed his friends by him are shent,<BR>
Who thus bring down on him the hate of all.<BR>
The Thracian leader never more content<BR>
Than to obey, whatever be the call,<BR>
Is at my bidding ever prompt to smite,<BR>
Without regarding who or what the wight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When I perceive that, through the warrior&#8217;s mean,<BR>
Extinguished is my father&#8217;s every foe;<BR>
And, conquered by himself, that knight is seen<BR>
&#8212;Friendless, through us&#8212;I now the masque forego;<BR>
What I, from him, beneath a flattering mien,<BR>
Had hitherto concealed, I plainly show;<BR>
&#8212;What deep and deadly hate by bosom fired,<BR>
And that I but to work his death desired.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then, thinking if such course I should pursue,<BR>
That public shame would still the deed attend,<BR>
(For men too well my obligations knew,<BR>
And would be prompt my cruelty to shend.)<BR>
Meseemed enough to drive him from my view,<BR>
So that he should no more my eyes offend:<BR>
Nor would I more address or see the peer,<BR>
Nor letter would receive or message hear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This my ingratitude in him such pain<BR>
At length produced, that mastered by his woe,<BR>
After entreating mercy long in vain,<BR>
He sickened sore and sank beneath the blow.<BR>
For pain which fits my sin, dark fumes now stain<BR>
My cheek, and with salt rheum mine eyes o&#8217;erflow.<BR>
Thus in eternal torment shall I dwell;<BR>
For saving mercy helpeth not in hell.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Since wretched Lydia spake no more, the peer<BR>
Would fain discern if more in torment lay;<BR>
But, those false ingrates&#8217; curse, the darkness drear<BR>
So waxed before him, and obscured the way,<BR>
That not one inch advanced the cavalier;<BR>
Nay, back parforce returns that warrior; nay,<BR>
Himself from that increasing smoke to save,<BR>
Makes for the mouth of the disastrous cave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
The motion of his quickly shifting feet<BR>
More savours of a run than walk or trot.<BR>
Thus mounting the ascent in swift retreat,<BR>
Astolpho sees the outlet of the grot;<BR>
Where, through the darkness of that dismal seat<BR>
And those foul fumes, a dawn of daylight shot;<BR>
He from the cavern, sorely pained and pined,<BR>
Issues at last, and leaves the smoke behind;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
And next to bar the way against that band,<BR>
Whose greedy bellies so for victual crave,<BR>
Picks stones, and trees lays level with his brand,<BR>
Which charged with pepper or amomum wave;<BR>
And what might seem a hedge, with busy hand,<BR>
As best he can, constructs before the cave;<BR>
And so succeeds in blocking that repair,<BR>
The harpies shall no more revisit air.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
While in that cave Astolpho did remain,<BR>
The fumes that from the sable pitch arose,<BR>
Not only what appeared to sight did stain;<BR>
But even so searched the flesh beneath his clothes,<BR>
He sought some cleansing stream, long sought in vain;<BR>
But found at length a limpid till, which rose<BR>
Out of a living rock, within that wood,<BR>
And bathed himself all over in the flood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Then backed the griffin-horse, and soared a flight<BR>
Whereby to reach that mountain&#8217;s top he schemes,<BR>
Which little distant, with its haughty height,<BR>
From the moon&#8217;s circle good Astolpho deems;<BR>
And, such desire to see it warms the knight,<BR>
That he aspires to heaven, nor earth esteems.<BR>
Through air so more and more the warrior strains,<BR>
That he at last the mountain-summit gains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Here sapphire, ruby, gold, and topaz glow,<BR>
Pearl, jacinth, chrysolite and diamond lie,<BR>
Which well might pass for natural flowers which blow,<BR>
Catching their colour from that kindly sky.<BR>
So green the grass! could we have such below,<BR>
We should prefer it to our emerald&#8217;s dye.<BR>
As fair the foliage of those pleasant bowers!<BR>
Whose trees are ever filled with fruit and flowers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Warble the wanton birds in verdant brake,<BR>
Azure, and red, and yellow, green and white.<BR>
The quavering rivulet and quiet lake<BR>
In limpid hue surpass the crystal bright.<BR>
A breeze, which with one breath appears to shake,<BR>
Aye, without fill or fall, the foliage light,<BR>
To the quick air such lively motion lends,<BR>
That Day&#8217;s oppressive noon in nought offends;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
And this, mid fruit and flower and verdure there,<BR>
Evermore stealing divers odours, went;<BR>
And made of those mixt sweets a medley rare,<BR>
Which filled the spirit with a calm content.<BR>
In the mid plain arose a palace fair,<BR>
Which seemed as if with living flames it brent.<BR>
Such passing splendour and such glorious light<BR>
Shot from those walls, beyond all usage bright.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Thither where those transparent walls appear,<BR>
Which cover more than thirty miles in measure,<BR>
At ease and slowly moved the cavalier,<BR>
And viewed the lovely region at his leisure;<BR>
And deemed&#8212;compared with this&#8212;that sad and drear,<BR>
And seen by heaven and nature with displeasure,<BR>
Was the foul world, wherein we dwell below:<BR>
So jocund this, so sweet and fair in show!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Astound with wonder, paused the adventurous knight,<BR>
When to that shining palace he was nigh,<BR>
For, than the carbuncle more crimson bright,<BR>
It seemed one polished stone of sanguine dye.<BR>
O mighty wonder! O Daedalian sleight!<BR>
What fabric upon earth with this can vie?<BR>
Let them henceforth be silent, that in story<BR>
Exalt the world&#8217;s seven wonders to such glory!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
An elder, in the shining entrance-hall<BR>
Of that glad house, towards Astolpho prest;<BR>
Crimson his waistcoat was, and white his pall;<BR>
Vermillion seemed the mantle, milk the vest:<BR>
White was that ancient&#8217;s hair, and white withal<BR>
The bushy beard descending to his breast;<BR>
And from his reverend face such glory beamed,<BR>
Of the elect of Paradise he seemed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
He, with glad visage, to the paladin,<BR>
Who humbly, from his sell had lighted, cries:<BR>
&#8220;O gentle baron, that by will divine<BR>
Have soared to this terrestrial paradise!<BR>
Albeit nor you the cause of your design,<BR>
Nor you the scope of your desire surmise,<BR>
Believe, you not without high mystery steer<BR>
Hitherward, from your arctic hemisphere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You for instruction, how to furnish aid<BR>
To Charles and to the Church in utmost need,<BR>
With me to counsel, hither are conveyed,<BR>
Who without counsel from such distance speed.<BR>
But, son, ascribe not you the journey made<BR>
To wit or worth; nor through your winged steed,<BR>
Nor through your virtuous bugle had ye thriven,<BR>
But that such helping grace from God was given.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;We will discourse at better leisure more,<BR>
And you what must be done shall after hear;<BR>
But you that, through long fast, must hunger sore,<BR>
First brace your strength with us, with genial cheer.&#8221;<BR>
Continuing his discourse, that elder hoar<BR>
Raised mighty wonder in the cavalier,<BR>
When he avouched, as he his name disclosed,<BR>
That he THE HOLY GOSPEL, had composed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
He of our Lord so loved, the blessed John;<BR>
Of whom a speech among the brethren went,<BR>
He never should see death, and hence the Son<BR>
Of God with this rebuke St. Peter shent;<BR>
In saying, &#8220;What is it to thee, if one<BR>
Tarry on earth, till I anew be sent?&#8221;<BR>
Albeit he said not that he should not die,<BR>
That so he meant to say we plain descry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
Translated thither, he found company,<BR>
The patriarch Enoch, and the mighty seer<BR>
Elias; nor as yet those sainted three<BR>
Have seen corruption, but in garden, clear<BR>
Of earth&#8217;s foul air, will joy eternity<BR>
Of spring, till they angelic trumpets hear,<BR>
Sounding through heaven and earth, proclaim aloud<BR>
Christ&#8217;s second advent on the silvery cloud.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
The holy ancients to a chamber lead,<BR>
With welcome kind, the adventurous cavalier;<BR>
And in another then his flying steed<BR>
Sufficiently with goodly forage cheer.<BR>
Astolpho they with fruits of Eden feed,<BR>
So rich, that in his judgment &#8217;twould appear,<BR>
In some sort might our parents be excused<BR>
If, for such fruits, obedience they refused.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
When with that daily payment which man owes,<BR>
Nature had been contented by the peer,<BR>
As well of due refreshment as repose,<BR>
(For all and every comfort found he here)<BR>
And now Aurora left her ancient spouse,<BR>
Not for his many years to her less dear,<BR>
Rising from bed, Astolpho at his side<BR>
The apostle, so beloved of God, espied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Much that not lawfully could here be shown,<BR>
Taking him by the hand, to him he read.<BR>
&#8220;To you, though come from France, may be unknown<BR>
What there hath happened,&#8221; next the apostle said;<BR>
&#8220;Learn, your Orlando, for he hath foregone<BR>
The way wherein he was enjoined to tread,<BR>
Is visited of God, that ever shends<BR>
Him whom he loveth best, when he offends:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, your Orlando, at his birth endowed<BR>
With sovereign daring and with sovereign might,<BR>
On whom, beyond all usage, God bestowed<BR>
The grace, that weapon him should vainly smite,<BR>
Because he was selected from the crowd<BR>
To be defender of his Church&#8217;s right.<BR>
As he elected Sampson, called whilere<BR>
The Jew against the Philistine to cheer;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, your Orlando, for such gifts has made<BR>
Unto his heavenly Lord an ill return:<BR>
Who left his people, when most needing aid,<BR>
Then most abandoned to the heathens&#8217; scorn.<BR>
Incestuous love for a fair paynim maid<BR>
Had blinded so that knight, of grace forlorn,<BR>
That twice and more in fell and impious strife<BR>
The count has sought his faithful cousin&#8217;s life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hence God hath made him mad, and, in this vein,<BR>
Belly, and breast, and naked flesh expose;<BR>
And so diseased and troubled is his brain,<BR>
That none, and least himself, the champion knows,<BR>
Nebuchadnezzar whilom to such pain<BR>
God in his vengeance doomed, as story shows;<BR>
Sent, for seven years, of savage fury full,<BR>
To feed on grass and hay, like slavering bull.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But yet, because the Christian paladine<BR>
Has sinned against his heavenly Maker less,<BR>
He only for three months, by will divine,<BR>
Is doomed to cleanse himself of his excess.<BR>
Nor yet with other scope did your design<BR>
Of wending hither the Redeemer bless,<BR>
But that through us the mode you should explore,<BR>
Orlando&#8217;s missing senses to restore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis true to journey further ye will need,<BR>
And wholly must you leave this nether sphere;<BR>
To the moon&#8217;s circle you I have to lead,<BR>
Of all the planets to our world most near,<BR>
Because the medicine, that is fit to speed<BR>
Insane Orlando&#8217;s cure, is treasured here.<BR>
This night will we away, when over head<BR>
Her downward rays the silver moon shall shed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
In talk the blest apostle is diffuse<BR>
On this and that, until the day is worn:<BR>
But when the sun is sunk i&#8217; the salt sea ooze,<BR>
And overhead the moon uplifts her horn,<BR>
A chariot is prepared, erewhile in use<BR>
To scower the heavens, wherein of old was borne<BR>
From Jewry&#8217;s misty mountains to the sky,<BR>
Sainted Elias, rapt from mortal eye.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Four goodly coursers next, and redder far<BR>
Than flame, to that fair chariot yokes the sire;<BR>
Who, when the knight and he well seated are,<BR>
Collects the reins; and heavenward they aspire.<BR>
In airy circles swiftly rose the car,<BR>
And reached the region of eternal fire;<BR>
Whose heat the saint by miracle suspends,<BR>
While through the parted air the pair ascends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
The chariot, towering, threads the fiery sphere,<BR>
And rises thence into the lunar reign.<BR>
This, in its larger part they find as clear<BR>
As polished steel, when undefiled by stain;<BR>
And such it seems, or little less, when near,<BR>
As what the limits of our earth contain:<BR>
Such as our earth, the last of globes below,<BR>
Including seas, which round about it flow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Here doubly waxed the paladin&#8217;s surprize,<BR>
To see that place so large, when viewed at hand;<BR>
Resembling that a little hoop in size,<BR>
When from the globe surveyed whereon we stand,<BR>
And that he both his eyes behoved to strain,<BR>
If he would view Earth&#8217;s circling seas and land;<BR>
In that, by reason of the lack of light,<BR>
Their images attained to little height.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Here other river, lake, and rich champaign<BR>
Are seen, than those which are below descried;<BR>
Here other valley, other hill and plain,<BR>
With towns and cities of their own supplied;<BR>
Which mansions of such mighty size contain,<BR>
Such never he before of after spied.<BR>
Here spacious hold and lonely forest lay,<BR>
Where nymphs for ever chased the panting prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
He, that with other scope had thither soared,<BR>
Pauses not all these wonder to peruse:<BR>
But led by the disciple of our Lord,<BR>
His way towards a spacious vale pursues;<BR>
A place wherein is wonderfully stored<BR>
Whatever on our earth below we lose.<BR>
Collected there are all things whatsoe&#8217;er,<BR>
Lost through time, chance, or our own folly, here.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Nor here alone of realm and wealthy dower,<BR>
O&#8217;er which aye turns the restless wheel, I say:<BR>
I speak of what it is not in the power<BR>
Of Fortune to bestow, or take away.<BR>
Much fame is here, whereon Time and the Hour,<BR>
Like wasting moth, in this our planet prey.<BR>
Here countless vows, here prayers unnumbered lie,<BR>
Made by us sinful men to God on high:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
The lover&#8217;s tears and sighs; what time in pleasure<BR>
And play we here unprofitably spend;<BR>
To this, of ignorant men the eternal leisure,<BR>
And vain designs, aye frustrate of their end.<BR>
Empty desires so far exceed all measure,<BR>
They o&#8217;er that valley&#8217;s better part extend.<BR>
There wilt thou find, if thou wilt thither post,<BR>
Whatever thou on earth beneath hast lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
He, passing by those heaps, on either hand,<BR>
Of this and now of that the meaning sought;<BR>
Formed of swollen bladders here a hill did stand,<BR>
Whence he heard cries and tumults, as he thought.<BR>
These were old crowns of the Assyrian land<BR>
And Lydian&#8212;as that paladin was taught&#8212;<BR>
Grecian and Persian, all of ancient fame;<BR>
And now, alas! well-nigh without a name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Golden and silver hooks to sight succeed,<BR>
Heaped in a mass, the gifts which courtiers bear,<BR>
&#8212;Hoping thereby to purchase future meed&#8212;<BR>
To greedy prince and patron; many a snare,<BR>
Concealed in garlands, did the warrior heed,<BR>
Who heard, these signs of adulation were;<BR>
And in cicalas, which their lungs had burst,<BR>
Saw fulsome lays by venal poets versed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Loves of unhappy end in imagery<BR>
Of gold or jewelled bands he saw exprest;<BR>
Then eagles&#8217; talons, the authority<BR>
With which great lords their delegates invest:<BR>
Bellows filled every nook, the fume and fee<BR>
Wherein the favourites of kings are blest:<BR>
Given to those Ganymedes that have their hour,<BR>
And reft, when faded is their vernal flower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
O&#8217;erturned, here ruined town and castle lies,<BR>
With all their wealth: &#8220;The symbols&#8221; (said his guide)<BR>
&#8220;Of treaties and of those conspiracies,<BR>
Which their conductors seemed so ill to hide.&#8221;<BR>
Serpents with female faces, felonies<BR>
Of coiners and of robbers, he descried;<BR>
Next broken bottles saw of many sorts,<BR>
The types of servitude in sorry courts.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
He marks mighty pool of porridge spilled,<BR>
And asks what in that symbol should be read,<BR>
And hears &#8217;twas charity, by sick men willed<BR>
For distribution, after they were dead.<BR>
He passed a heap of flowers, that erst distilled<BR>
Sweet savours, and now noisome odours shed;<BR>
The gift (if it may lawfully be said)<BR>
Which Constantine to good Sylvester made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
A large provision, next, of twigs and lime<BR>
&#8212;Your witcheries, O women!&#8212;he explored.<BR>
The things he witnessed, to recount in rhyme<BR>
Too tedious were; were myriads on record,<BR>
To sum the remnant ill should I have time.<BR>
&#8217;Tis here that all infirmities are stored,<BR>
Save only Madness, seen not here at all,<BR>
Which dwells below, nor leaves this earthly ball.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
He turns him back, upon some days and deeds<BR>
To look again, which he had lost of yore;<BR>
But, save the interpreter the lesson reads,<BR>
Would know them not, such different form they wore.<BR>
He next saw that which man so little needs,<BR>
&#8212;As it appears&#8212;none pray to Heaven for more;<BR>
I speak of sense, whereof a lofty mount<BR>
Alone surpast all else which I recount.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
It was as &#8217;twere a liquor soft and thin,<BR>
Which, save well corked, would from the vase have drained;<BR>
Laid up, and treasured various flasks within,<BR>
Larger or lesser, to that use ordained.<BR>
That largest was which of the paladin,<BR>
Anglantes&#8217; lord, the mighty sense contained;<BR>
And from those others was discerned, since writ<BR>
Upon the vessel was ORLANDO&#8217;S WIT.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
The names of those whose wits therein were pent<BR>
He thus on all those other flasks espied.<BR>
Much of his own, but with more wonderment,<BR>
The sense of many others he descried,<BR>
Who, he believed, no dram of theirs had spent;<BR>
But here, by tokens clear was satisfied,<BR>
That scantily therewith were they purveyed;<BR>
So large the quantity he here surveyed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Some waste on love, some seeking honour, lose<BR>
Their wits, some, scowering seas, for merchandise,<BR>
Some, that on wealthy lords their hope repose,<BR>
And some, befooled by silly sorceries;<BR>
These upon pictures, upon jewels those;<BR>
These on whatever else they highest prize.<BR>
Astrologers&#8217; and sophists&#8217; wits mid these,<BR>
And many a poet&#8217;s too, Astolpho sees.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Since his consent the apostle signified<BR>
Who wrote the obscure Apocalypse, his own<BR>
He took, and only to his nose applied,<BR>
When (it appeared) it to its place was gone;<BR>
And henceforth, has Sir Turpin certified,<BR>
That long time sagely lived king Otho&#8217;s son;<BR>
Till other error (as he says) again<BR>
Deprived the gentle baron of his brain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
The fullest vessel and of amplest round<BR>
Which held the wit Orlando erst possessed,<BR>
Astolpho took; nor this so light he found,<BR>
As it appeared, when piled among the rest.<BR>
Before, from those bright spheres, now earthward bound,<BR>
His course is to our lower orb addressed,<BR>
Him to a spacious palace, by whose side<BR>
A river ran, conducts his holy guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Filled full of fleeces all its chambers were,<BR>
Of wool, silk, linen, cotton, in their hue,<BR>
Of diverse dyes and colours, foul and fair.<BR>
Yarns to her reel from all those fleeces drew,<BR>
In the outer porch, a dame of hoary hair.<BR>
On summer-day thus village wife we view,<BR>
When the new silk is reeled, its filmy twine<BR>
Wind from the worm, and soak the slender line.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
A second dame replaced the work when done<BR>
With other; and one bore it off elsewhere;<BR>
A third selected from the fleeces spun,<BR>
And mingled by that second, foul from fair.<BR>
&#8220;What is this labour?&#8221; said the peer to John;<BR>
And the disciple answered Otho&#8217;s heir,<BR>
&#8220;Know that the Parcae are those ancient wives,<BR>
That in this fashion spin your feeble lives.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As long as one fleece lasts, life in such wise<BR>
Endureth, nor outlasts it by a thought.<BR>
For Death and Nature have their watchful eyes<BR>
On the hour when each should to his end be brought.<BR>
The choicest threads are culled for Paradise,<BR>
And, after, for its ornaments are wrought;<BR>
And fashioned from the strands of foulest show<BR>
Are galling fetters for the damned below.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
On all the fleeces that erewhile were laid<BR>
Upon the reel, and culled for other care,<BR>
The names were graved on little plates, which made<BR>
Of silver, or of gold, or iron, were,<BR>
These piled in many heaps he next surveyed;<BR>
Whence an old man some skins was seen to bear,<BR>
Who, seemingly unwearied, hurried sore,<BR>
His restless way retracing evermore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
That elder is so nimble and so prest,<BR>
That he seems born to run; he bears away<BR>
Out of those heaps by lapfulls in his vest<BR>
The tickets that the different names display.<BR>
Wherefore and whither he his steps addrest,<BR>
To you I shall in other canto say,<BR>
If you, in sign of pleasure, will attend,<BR>
With that kind audience ye are wont to lend.</TD></TR>
