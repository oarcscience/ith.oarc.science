<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Agramant breaks the pact, is overthrown,<BR>
And forced fair France for Afric to forego.<BR>
Meanwhile Astolpho in Biserta&#8217;s town<BR>
Having with numerous host besieged the foe,<BR>
By hazard there arrives bold Milo&#8217;s son,<BR>
To whom the duke, instructed how to do,<BR>
Restores his wits. At sea does Dudon meet<BR>
King Agramant, and sore annoys his fleet.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Than that fell woe which on Rogero weighs<BR>
Harder, and bitterer pain forsooth is none,<BR>
Which upon flesh and more on spirit preys:<BR>
For of two deaths there is no scaping one.<BR>
Him, if in strife o&#8217;erlaid, Rinaldo slays,<BR>
Bradamant, if Rinaldo is outdone:<BR>
For if he killed her brother, well he knew<BR>
Her hate, than death more hateful, would ensue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo, unimpeded by such thought,<BR>
Strove in all ways Rogero to o&#8217;erthrow;<BR>
Fierce and despiteous whirled his axe, and sought<BR>
Now in the arms, now head, to wound the foe.<BR>
Rogero circled here and there, and caught<BR>
Upon his weapon&#8217;s shaft the coming blow;<BR>
And, if ever smote, aye strove to smite<BR>
Where he should injure least Montalban&#8217;s knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
To most of them that led the paynim bands,<BR>
But too unequal seemed the fierce assay.<BR>
Too slowly young Rogero plied his hands;<BR>
Too well Rinaldo kept the Child at bay.<BR>
With troubled face the king of Afric stands:<BR>
He sighed, and breathless gazed upon the fray;<BR>
And all the blame of that ill counsel flung<BR>
On King Sobrino&#8217;s head, from whom it sprung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile the weird Melissa, she&#8212;the font<BR>
Of all that wizards or enchanters know&#8212;<BR>
Had by her art transformed her female front,<BR>
And taken Argier&#8217;s mighty shape; in show<BR>
And gesture she appeared as Rodomont,<BR>
And seemed, like him, in dragon&#8217;s hide to go:<BR>
Such was her belied sword and such her shield;<BR>
Nor aught was wanting which he wore afield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
She towards Troyano&#8217;s mournful son did guide,<BR>
In form of courser, a familiar sprite,<BR>
And with a troubled visage loudly cried,<BR>
&#8220;My liege, this is too foul an oversight,<BR>
A stripling boy in peril yet untried,<BR>
Against a Gaul, so stout and famed in fight,<BR>
Your champion in so fierce a strife to make;<BR>
Where Afric&#8217;s realm and honour are at stake.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Let not this battle be pursued, my lord,<BR>
In that &#8217;twould cost our Moorish cause too dear.<BR>
Let sin of broken faith and forfeit word<BR>
Fall upon Rodomont! take thou no fear!<BR>
Let each now show the metal of his sword,<BR>
Each for a hundred stands when I am here.&#8221;<BR>
So upon Agramant this counsel wrought,<BR>
That king pressed forward without further thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
He, thinking that the monarch of Algiers<BR>
Is with him, of the pact has little care;<BR>
And would not rate a thousand cavaliers<BR>
So high, if handed in his aid they were.<BR>
Hence steeds reined-in and spurred, hence levelled spears<BR>
Are seen in one short instant here and there.<BR>
Melissa, when the hosts are mixed in fight<BR>
By her false phantoms, vanishes from sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
The champions two, that, against all accord,<BR>
Against all faith, disturbed their duel see,<BR>
No longer strive in fight, but pledge their word<BR>
&#8212;Yea, put aside all hostile injury&#8212;<BR>
That they, on neither part, will draw the sword,<BR>
Until they better certified shall be<BR>
Who broke the pact, established by that twain,<BR>
Young Agramant, or aged Charlemagne.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
They sweat anew, the king who had o&#8217;erthrown<BR>
That truce, and broken faith, as foe to treat.<BR>
The field of combat is turned upside down;<BR>
Some hurry to the charge, and some retreat.<BR>
Who most deserved disgrace, who most renown,<BR>
Was seen, on both hands, in the selfsame feat;<BR>
All ran alike: but, &#8217;mid that wild affray,<BR>
These ran to meet the foe, those ran away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
As greyhound in the slip, that the fleet hare<BR>
Scowering about and circling him discerns,<BR>
Nor with the other dogs a part can bear<BR>
(For him the hunter holds), with anger burns;<BR>
Torments himself and mourns in his despair,<BR>
And whines, and strives against the leash, by turns;<BR>
Such till that moment had the fury been<BR>
Of Aymon&#8217;s daughter and the martial queen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
They till that hour upon the spacious plain,<BR>
Had watched so rich a prize throughout the day;<BR>
And, as obliged by treaty to refrain<BR>
From laying hands upon the costly prey,<BR>
Had sore lamented and had grieved in vain,<BR>
Gazing with longing eyes on that array.<BR>
Now seeing truce and treaty broke, among<BR>
The Moorish squadrons they rejoicing sprung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa piercing her first victim&#8217;s breast,<BR>
(Two yards beyond his back the lance did pass)<BR>
In briefer time than &#8217;tis by me exprest,<BR>
Broke with her sword four helms which flew like glass;<BR>
No less did Bradamant upon the rest;<BR>
But them her spear reduced to other pass.<BR>
All touched by that gold lance she overthrew;<BR>
Doubling Marphisa&#8217;s score; yet none she slew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
They witness to each others&#8217; exploits are,<BR>
(Those maids to one another are so near)<BR>
Then, whither fury drives, the martial pair,<BR>
Dividing, through the Moorish ranks career.<BR>
Who could each several warrior&#8217;s name declare,<BR>
Stretched on the champaign by that golden spear?<BR>
Or reckon every head Marphisa left<BR>
Divided by her horrid sword, or cleft?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
As when benigner winds more swiftly blow,<BR>
And Apennine his shaggy back lays bare,<BR>
Two turbid torrents with like fury flow,<BR>
Which, in their fall, two separate channels wear,<BR>
Uproot hard rocks, and mighty trees which grow<BR>
On their steep banks, and field and harvest bear<BR>
Into the vale, and seem as if they vied<BR>
Which should do mightiest damage on its side:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
So those high-minded virgin warriors two,<BR>
Scowering the field in separate courses, made<BR>
Huge havock of the Moors; whom they pursue<BR>
One with couched lance, and one with lifted blade.<BR>
Hardly King Agramant his Africk crew<BR>
From flight, beneath his royal banners stayed:<BR>
In search of Rodomont, he vainly turned;<BR>
Nor tidings of the missing warrior learned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
He at his exhortation (so he trowed)<BR>
Had broke the treaty made in solemn wise,<BR>
To witness which the gods were called aloud;<BR>
Who then so quick vanished from his eyes:<BR>
Nor sees he King Sobrino; disavowed<BR>
By King Sobrino is the deed, who flies<BR>
To Arles, and deems that day some vengeance dread<BR>
Will fall on Agramant&#8217;s devoted head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Marsilius too is fled into the town:<BR>
So has that monarch holy faith at heart.<BR>
&#8217;Tis hence, that feebly King Troyano&#8217;s son<BR>
Resists the crew, that war on Charles&#8217;s part,<BR>
Italians, English, Germans; of renown<BR>
Are all; and, scattered upon every part,<BR>
Are mixed the paladins, those barons bold,<BR>
Glittering like jewels on a cloth of gold;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
And, with those peers, is more than one confest<BR>
As perfect as is earthly cavalier,<BR>
Guide the savage, that intrepid breast,<BR>
And those two famous sons of Olivier.<BR>
I will not now repeat what I exprest<BR>
Of that fierce, daring female twain whilere;<BR>
Who on the field so many Moors extend,<BR>
No number is there to the slain or end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
But, putting this affray some while aside,<BR>
Without a pinnace will I pass the sea.<BR>
To them of France so fast I am not tied,<BR>
But that Astolpho should remembered be:<BR>
Of the grace given him by his holy guide<BR>
I told erewhile, and told (it seems to me)<BR>
Branzardo and the king of Algaziers<BR>
Against the duke had mustered all their spears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Such as the monarchs could in haste engage,<BR>
Raked from all Africa, that host contained;<BR>
Whether of fitting or of feeble age:<BR>
Scarce from impressing women they refrained,<BR>
Resolved his thirst of vengeance to assuage,<BR>
Agramant twice his Africa had drained.<BR>
Few people in the land were left, and they<BR>
A feeble and dispirited array.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
So proved they; for the foe was scarce in view,<BR>
Before that levy broke in panic dread:<BR>
Like sheep, their quailing bands Astolpho slew,<BR>
Charging at his more martial squadrons&#8217; head;<BR>
And with the slain filled all that champaign; few<BR>
Into Biserta from the carnage fled.<BR>
A prisoner valiant Bucifar remained;<BR>
The town in safety King Branzardo gained;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
More grieved as Bucifaro&#8217;s loss alone,<BR>
Than had he lost the rest in arms arrayed.<BR>
Wide and in want of ramparts is the town;<BR>
And these could ill be raised without his aid.<BR>
While fain to ransom him, he thinks upon<BR>
The means, and stands afflicted and dismayed,<BR>
He recollects him how the paladin,<BR>
Dudon, has many a month his prisoner been.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Him under Monaco, upon the shore,<BR>
In his first passage, Sarza&#8217;s monarch took.<BR>
Thenceforth had been a prisoner evermore<BR>
Dudon, who was derived of Danish stock.<BR>
The paladin against the royal Moor<BR>
Branzardo thought, in this distress, to truck;<BR>
And knowing through sure spy, Astolpho led<BR>
The Nubians, to that chief the offer sped.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
A paladin himself, Astolpho knows<BR>
He gladly ought a paladin to free;<BR>
And when that case the Moorish envoy shows,<BR>
To King Branzardo&#8217;s offer does agree.<BR>
Dudon from prison loosed, his thanks bestows;<BR>
And whatsoe&#8217;er pertains to land or sea,<BR>
Bestirs him to accomplish, in accord<BR>
With his illustrious chief, the English lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Astolpho leading such a countless band<BR>
As might have well seven Africas opprest,<BR>
And recollecting &#8217;twas the saint&#8217;s command,<BR>
Who upon him whilere imposed the quest,<BR>
That fair Provence and Aquamorta&#8217;s strand<BR>
He from the reaving Saracen should wrest,<BR>
Made through his numerous host a second draught<BR>
Of such as least inapt for sea he thought;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
And filling next as full as they could be<BR>
His hands with many different sorts of leaves,<BR>
Plucked from palm, olive, bay and cedar tree,<BR>
Approached the shore, and cast them on the waves.<BR>
Oh blessed souls! Oh great felicity!<BR>
O grace! which rarely man from God receives;<BR>
O strange and wondrous miracle, which sprung<BR>
Out of those leaves upon the waters flung!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
They wax in number beyond all esteem;<BR>
Becoming crooked and heavy, long, and wide.<BR>
Into hard timber turn and solid beam,<BR>
The slender veins that branch on either side:<BR>
Taper the masts; and, moored in the salt stream,<BR>
All in a thought transformed to vessels, ride;<BR>
And of as diverse qualities appear,<BR>
As are the plants, whereon they grew whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
It was a miracle to see them grown<BR>
To galliot, galley, frigate ship, and boat;<BR>
Wondrous, that they with tackling of their own,<BR>
Are found as well as any barks afloat.<BR>
Nor lack there men to govern them, when blown<BR>
By blustering winds&#8212;from islands not remote&#8212;<BR>
Sardinia or Corsica, of every rate,<BR>
Pilot and patron, mariner and mate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Twenty-six thousand were the troop that manned<BR>
Those ready barks of every sort and kind.<BR>
To Dudon&#8217;s government, by sea or land<BR>
A leader sage, the navy was consigned;<BR>
Which yet lay anchored off the Moorish strand,<BR>
Expecting a more favourable wind,<BR>
To put to sea; when, freighted with a load<BR>
Of prisoners, lo! a vessel made the road.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
She carried those, whom at the bridge of dread,<BR>
&#8212;On that so narrow place of battle met&#8212;<BR>
Rodomont took, as often has been said.<BR>
The valiant Olivier was of the set,<BR>
Orlando&#8217;s kin, and, with them, prisoners led,<BR>
Were faithful Brandimart and Sansonet,<BR>
With more; to tell whereof there is no need;<BR>
Of German, Gascon, or Italian seed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
The patron, yet unweeting he should find<BR>
Foes in the port, here entered to unload;<BR>
Having left Argier many miles behind,<BR>
Where he was minded to have made abode;<BR>
Because a boisterous, overblowing, wind<BR>
Had driven his bark beyond her destined road;<BR>
Deeming himself as safe and welcome guest,<BR>
As Progne, when she seeks her noisy nest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
But when, arrived, the imperial eagle spread,<BR>
And pards and golden lilies he descries,<BR>
With countenance as sicklied o&#8217;er by dread,<BR>
He stands, as one that in unwary guise,<BR>
Has chanced on fell and poisonous snake to tread,<BR>
Which, in the grass, opprest with slumber lies;<BR>
And, pale and startled, hastens to retire<BR>
From that ill reptile, swoln with bane and ire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
But no retreat from peril is there here,<BR>
Nor can the patron keep his prisoners down:<BR>
Him thither Brandimart and Olivier,<BR>
Sansonet and those others drag, where known<BR>
And greeted are the friends with joyful cheer,<BR>
By England&#8217;s duke and Danish Ogier&#8217;s son;<BR>
Who read that he who brought them to that shore<BR>
Should for his pains be sentenced to the oar.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
King Otho&#8217;s son kind welcome did afford<BR>
Unto those Christian cavaliers, as said:<BR>
Who&#8212;honoured at his hospitable board&#8212;<BR>
With arms and all things needful were purveyed.<BR>
His going, for their sake, the Danish lord<BR>
Deferred, who deemed his voyage well delayed,<BR>
To parley with those peers, though at the cost<BR>
Of one or two good days, in harbour lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Of Charles, and in what state, what order are<BR>
The affairs of France they gave advices true;<BR>
Told where he best could disembark, and where<BR>
To most advantage of the Christian crew.<BR>
While so the cavaliers their news declare,<BR>
A noise is heard; which ever louder grew,<BR>
Followed by such a fierce alarm withal,<BR>
As to more fears than one gave rise in all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
The duke Astolpho and the goodly throng,<BR>
That in discourse with him were occupied,<BR>
Armed in a moment, on their coursers sprung,<BR>
And hurried where the Nubians loudest cried;<BR>
And seeking wherefore that wide larum rung,<BR>
Now here, now there&#8212;those warlike lords espied<BR>
A savage man, and one so strong of hand,<BR>
Naked and sole he troubled all that band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
The naked savage whirled a sapling round,<BR>
So hard, so heavy, and so strong of grain,<BR>
That every time the weapon went to ground,<BR>
Some warrior, more than maimed, opprest the plain.<BR>
Above a hundred dead are strewed around;<BR>
Nor more defence the routed hands maintain;<BR>
Save that a war of distant parts they try;<BR>
For there is none will wait the champion nigh.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Astolpho, Brandimart, the Danish knight,<BR>
Hastening towards that noise with Olivier,<BR>
Remain astounded at the wondrous might<BR>
And courage, which in that wild man appear.<BR>
When, posting thither on a palfry light,<BR>
Is seen a damsel, clad in sable gear.<BR>
To Brandimart in haste that lady goes,<BR>
And both her arms about the warrior throws.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
This was fair Flordelice, whose bosom so<BR>
Burned with the love of Monodantes&#8217; son,<BR>
She, when she left him prisoner to his foe<BR>
At that streight bridge, had nigh distracted gone.<BR>
From France had she past hither&#8212;given to know&#8212;<BR>
By that proud paynim, who the deed had done,<BR>
How Brandimart, with many cavaliers,<BR>
Was prisoner in the city of Algiers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
When now she for that harbour would have weighed,<BR>
An eastern vessel in Marseilles she found,<BR>
Which thither had an ancient knight conveyed:<BR>
Of Monodantes&#8217; household; a long round<BR>
To seek his Brandimart that lord had made,<BR>
By sea, and upon many a distant ground.<BR>
For he, upon his way, had heard it told,<BR>
How he in France should find the warrior bold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
She knowing old Bardino in that wight,<BR>
Bardino who from Monodantes&#8217; court<BR>
With little Brandimart had taken flight,<BR>
And reared his nursling in THE SYLVAN FORT;<BR>
Then hearing what had thither brought the knight,<BR>
With her had made him loosen from the port;<BR>
Relating to that elder, by what chance<BR>
Brandimart had to Africk passed from France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
As soon as landed, that Biserta lies<BR>
Besieged by good Astolpho&#8217;s band, they hear;<BR>
That Brandimart is with him in the emprize,<BR>
They learn, but learn not as a matter clear.<BR>
Now in such haste to him the damsel flies,<BR>
When she beholds her faithful cavalier,<BR>
As plainly shows her joy; which woes o&#8217;erblown<BR>
Had made the mightiest she had ever known.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
The gentle baron no less gladly eyed<BR>
His faithful and beloved consort&#8217;s face;<BR>
Her whom he prized above all things beside;<BR>
And clipt and welcomed her with loving grace;<BR>
Nor his warm wishes would have satisfied<BR>
A first, a second, or a third embrace,<BR>
But that he spied Bardino, he that came<BR>
From France, together with that faithful dame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
He stretched his arms, and would embrace the knight;<BR>
And&#8212;wherefore he was come&#8212;would bid him say:<BR>
But was prevented by the sudden flight<BR>
Of the sacred host, which fled in disarray,<BR>
Before the club of that mad, naked wight,<BR>
Who with the brandished sapling cleared his way.<BR>
Flordelice viewed the furious man in front;<BR>
And cried to Brandimart, &#8220;Behold the count!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
At the same time, withal, Astolpho bold<BR>
That this was good Orlando plainly knew,<BR>
By signs, whereof those ancient saints had told,<BR>
In the earthly paradise, as tokens true.<BR>
None of those others, who the knight behold,<BR>
The courteous baron in the madman view;<BR>
That from long self-neglect, while wild he ran,<BR>
Had in his visage more of beast than man.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
With breast and heart transfixed with pity, cried<BR>
Valiant Astolpho&#8212;bathed with many a tear&#8212;<BR>
Turning to Danish Dudon, at this side,<BR>
And afterwards to valiant Olivier;<BR>
&#8220;Behold Orlando!&#8221; Him awhile they eyed,<BR>
Straining their eyes and lids; then knew the peer;<BR>
And, seeing him in such a piteous plight,<BR>
Were filled with grief and wonder at the sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
So grieve and so lament the greater part<BR>
Of those good warriors, that their eyes o&#8217;erflow.<BR>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis time&#8221; (Astolpho cried) &#8220;to find some art<BR>
To heal him, not indulge in useless woe&#8221;;<BR>
And from his courser sprang: bold Brandimart,<BR>
Olivier, Sansonet and Dudon so<BR>
All leap to ground, and all together make<BR>
At Roland, whom the warriors fain would take.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Seeing the circle round about him grow,<BR>
Levels his club that furious paladin,<BR>
And makes fierce Dudon feel (who&#8212;couched below<BR>
His buckler&#8212;on the madman would break in)<BR>
How grievous is that staff&#8217;s descending blow;<BR>
And but that Olivier, Orlando&#8217;s kin,<BR>
Broke in some sort its force, that stake accurst<BR>
Had shield and helmet, head and body burst.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
It only burst the shield, and in such thunder<BR>
Broke on the casque, that Dudon prest the shore:<BR>
With that, Sir Sansonet cut clean asunder<BR>
The sapling, shorn of two cloth-yards and more,<BR>
So vigorous was that warrior&#8217;s stroke, while under<BR>
His bosom, Brandimart girt Roland sore<BR>
With sinewy arms about his body flung;<BR>
And to the champion&#8217;s legs Astolpho clung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
Orlando shook himself, and England&#8217;s knight,<BR>
Ten paces off, reversed upon the ground;<BR>
Yet loosed not Brandimart, who with more might<BR>
And better hold had clasped the madman round.<BR>
To Olivier, too forward in that fight,<BR>
He dealt so furious and so fell a wound,<BR>
With his clenched fist, that pale the marquis fell;<BR>
And purple streams from eyes and nostrils well;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
And save his morion had been more than good,<BR>
Bold Olivier had breathed his last, who lies,<BR>
So battered with his fall, it seemed he wou&#8217;d<BR>
Bequeath his parting soul to paradise.<BR>
Astolpho and Dudon, that again upstood<BR>
(Albeit swoln were Dudon&#8217;s face and eyes)<BR>
And Sansonet, who plied so well his sword,<BR>
All made together at Anglantes&#8217; lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Dudon Orlando from behind embraced,<BR>
And with his foot the furious peer would throw:<BR>
Astolpho and others seize his arms; but waste<BR>
Their strength in all attempts to hold the foe.<BR>
He who has seen a bull, by mastiffs chased<BR>
That gore his bleeding ears, in fury lowe,<BR>
Dragging the dogs that bait him there and here,<BR>
Yet from their tusks unable to get clear;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Let him imagine, so Orlando drew<BR>
Astolpho and those banded knights along.<BR>
Meanwhile upstarted Oliviero, who<BR>
By that fell fistycuff on earth was flung;<BR>
And, seeing they could ill by Roland do<BR>
That sought by good Astolpho and his throng,<BR>
He meditates, and compasses, a way<BR>
The frantic paladin on earth to lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
He many a hawser made them thither bring,<BR>
And running knots in them he quickly tied;<BR>
Which on the count&#8217;s waist, arms, and legs, they fling;<BR>
And then, among themselves, the ends divide,<BR>
Conveyed to this or that amid the ring,<BR>
Compassing Roland upon every side.<BR>
The warriors thus Orlando flung parforce,<BR>
As farrier throws the struggling ox or horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
As soon as down, they all upon him are,<BR>
And hands and feet more tightly they constrain:<BR>
He shakes himself, and plunges here and there;<BR>
But all his efforts for relief are vain.<BR>
Astolpho bade them hence the prisoner bear;<BR>
For he would heal (he said) the warrior&#8217;s brain.<BR>
Shouldered by sturdy Dudon is the load,<BR>
And on the beach&#8217;s furthest brink bestowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Seven times Astolpho makes them wash the knight;<BR>
And seven times plunged beneath the brine he goes.<BR>
So that they cleanse away the scurf and blight,<BR>
Which to his stupid limbs and visage grows.<BR>
This done, with herbs, for that occasion dight,<BR>
They stop his mouth, wherewith he puffs and blows.<BR>
For, save his nostrils, would Astolpho leave<BR>
No passage whence the count might air receive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Valiant Astolpho had prepared the vase,<BR>
Wherein Orlando&#8217;s senses were contained,<BR>
And to his nostrils in such mode conveys,<BR>
That, drawing-in his breath, the county drained<BR>
The mystic cup withal. Oh wondrous case!<BR>
The unsettled mind its ancient seat regained;<BR>
And, in its glorious reasonings, yet more clear<BR>
And lucid waxed his wisdom than whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
As one, that seems in troubled sleep to see<BR>
Abominable shapes, a horrid crew;<BR>
Monsters which are not, and which cannot be;<BR>
Or seems some strange, unlawful thing to do,<BR>
Yet marvels at himself, from slumber free.<BR>
When his recovered senses play him true;<BR>
So good Orlando, when he is made sound,<BR>
Remains yet full of wonder, and astound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
Aldabelle&#8217;s brother, Monodantes&#8217; son,<BR>
And him that on his brain such cure had wrought,<BR>
He wondering marked, but word he spake to none;<BR>
And when and how he was brought thither, thought.<BR>
He turned his restless eyes now up now down,<BR>
Nor where he was withal, imagined aught,<BR>
Marvelling why he there was naked cast,<BR>
And wherefore tethered, neck and heels, so fast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Then said, as erst Silenus said&#8212;when seen,<BR>
And taken sleeping the cave of yore&#8212;<BR>
SOLVITE ME, with visage so serene,<BR>
With look so much less wayward than before,<BR>
That him they from his bonds delivered clean,<BR>
And raiment to the naked warrior bore;<BR>
All comforting their friend, with grief opprest<BR>
For that delusion which had him possest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
When to his former self he was recovered,<BR>
Of wiser and of manlier mind than e&#8217;er,<BR>
From love as well was freed the enamoured lord;<BR>
And she, so gentle deemed, so fair whilere,<BR>
And by renowned Orlando so adored,<BR>
Did but to him a worthless thing appear.<BR>
What he through love had lost, to reacquire<BR>
Was his whole study, was his whole desire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile Bardino told to Brandimart,<BR>
How Monodantes, his good sire, was dead,<BR>
And, on his brother, Gigliantes&#8217; part,<BR>
To call him to his kingdom had he sped,<BR>
As well as from those isles, which most apart<BR>
From other lands, in eastern seas are spread,<BR>
That prince&#8217;s fair inheritance; than which<BR>
Was none more pleasant, populous, or rich.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
He said, mid many reasons which he prest,<BR>
That home was sweet, and&#8212;were the warrior fain<BR>
To taste that sweet&#8212;he ever would detest<BR>
A wandering life; and Brandimart again<BR>
Replies, through all that war, he will not rest<BR>
From serving Roland and King Charlemagne;<BR>
And after, if he lives to see its end,<BR>
To his own matters better will attend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Upon the following day, for Provence steer<BR>
The shipping under Danish Dudon&#8217;s care;<BR>
When with the duke retired Anglantes&#8217; peer,<BR>
And heard that lord the warfare&#8217;s state declare:<BR>
Then prest with siege Biserta, far and near,<BR>
But let good England&#8217;s knight the honour wear<BR>
Of every vantage; while Astolpho still<BR>
In all was guided by Orlando&#8217;s will.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
The order taken to attack the town<BR>
Of huge Biserta, when, and on what side;<BR>
How, at the first assault, the walls are won,<BR>
And with Orlando who the palm divide,<BR>
Lament not that I now shall leave unshown,<BR>
Since for short time I lay my tale aside.<BR>
In the meanwhile, how fierce an overthrow<BR>
The Moors received in France, be pleased to know.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Well nigh abandoned was their royal lord<BR>
In his worst peril; for to Arles again<BR>
Had gone, with many of the paynim horde,<BR>
The sage Sobrino and the king of Spain;<BR>
Who, for the deemed the land unsafe, aboard<BR>
Their barks sought refuge, with a numerous train,<BR>
Barons and cavaliers, that served the Moor;<BR>
Who moved by their example put from shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Yet royal Agramant the fight maintains;<BR>
But when he can no longer make a stand,<BR>
Turns from the combat, and directly strains<BR>
For Arles, not far remote, upon the strand.<BR>
Him Rabican pursues, with flowing reins,<BR>
Whom Aymon&#8217;s daughter drives with heel and hand.<BR>
Him would she slay, through whom so often crost,<BR>
That martial maid had her Rogero lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa by the same desire was stirred,<BR>
Who had her thoughts on tardy vengeance placed,<BR>
For her dead sire; and as she fiercely spurred,<BR>
Made her hot courser feel his rider&#8217;s haste.<BR>
But neither martial maid, amid that herd<BR>
Of flying Moors, so well the monarch chased,<BR>
As to o&#8217;ertake him in his swift retreat,<BR>
First into Arles, and then aboard his fleet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
As two fair generous pards, that from some crag<BR>
Together dart, and stretch across the plain;<BR>
When they perceive that vigorous goat or stag,<BR>
Their nimble quarry, is pursued in vain,<BR>
As if ashamed they in that chase did lag,<BR>
Return repentant and in high disdain:<BR>
So, with a sigh, return those damsels two,<BR>
When they the paynim king in safety view:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Yet therefore halt not, but in fury go<BR>
Amid that crowd, which flies, possest with dread;<BR>
Feeling, now here, now there, at every blow,<BR>
Many that never more uprear their head.<BR>
To evil pass was brought the broken foe;<BR>
For safety was not even for them that fled:<BR>
Since Agramant, a sure retreat to gain,<BR>
Bade shut the city-gate which faced the plain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
And bade on Rhone break all the bridges down.<BR>
Unhappy people, ever held as cheap<BR>
&#8212;Weighed with the tyrant&#8217;s want who wears a crown&#8212;<BR>
As worthless herd of goats or silly sheep!<BR>
These in the sea, those in the river drown;<BR>
And those with blood the thirsty fallows steep.<BR>
The Franks few prisoners made, and many slew;<BR>
For ransom in that battle was for few.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Of the great multitude of either train,<BR>
Christened or paynim, killed in that last fight,<BR>
Though in unequal parts (for, of the slain,<BR>
By far more Saracens were killed in flight,<BR>
By hands of those redoubted damsels twain),<BR>
Signs even to this day remain in sight:<BR>
For, hard by Arles, where sleeps the lazy Rhone,<BR>
The plain with rising sepulchres is strown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile his heavy ships of deepest draught<BR>
King Agramant had made put forth to sea,<BR>
Leaving some barks in port&#8212;his lightest craft&#8212;<BR>
For them that would aboard his navy flee:<BR>
He stays two days, while they the stragglers waft,<BR>
And, for the winds are wild and contrary,<BR>
On the third day, to sail he give command,<BR>
In trust to make return to Africk&#8217;s land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Royal Marsilius, in that fatal hour,<BR>
Fearing the costs will fall upon his Spain,<BR>
And that the clouds, which big with tempest lower,<BR>
In the end will burst upon his fields and grain,<BR>
Makes for Valentia; where he town and tower<BR>
Begins to fortify with mickle pain;<BR>
And for that war prepares, which after ends<BR>
In the destruction of himself and friends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
King Agramant his sails for Africk bent:<BR>
His barks ill-armed and almost empty go;<BR>
Empty of men, but full of discontent,<BR>
In that three-fourths had perished by the foe.<BR>
As cruel some, as weak and proud some shent<BR>
Their king, and (as still happens in like woe)<BR>
All hate him privily; but, for they fear<BR>
His fury, in his presence mute appear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Yet sometimes two or three their lips unclose,<BR>
&#8212;Some knot of friends, where each on each relies&#8212;<BR>
And their pent choler and their rage expose:<BR>
Yet Agramant beneath the illusion lies,<BR>
That each will love and pity overflows;<BR>
And this befalls, because he still espies<BR>
False faces, hears but voices that applaud,<BR>
And nought but adulation, lies and fraud.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Not in Biserta&#8217;s port his host to land<BR>
Was the sage king of Africa&#8217;s intent,<BR>
Who had sure news that shore by Nubia&#8217;s band<BR>
Was held, but he so far above it meant<BR>
To steer his Moorish squadron, that the strand<BR>
Should not be steep or rugged for descent:<BR>
There would he disembark, and thence would aid<BR>
Forthwith his people, broken and dismaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
But favoured not by his foul destiny<BR>
Was that intention, provident and wise;<BR>
Which willed the fleet, from leaves of greenwood tree,<BR>
Produced upon the beach in wondrous guise,<BR>
That, bound for France, now ploughed the foaming sea,<BR>
Should meet the king at night; that from surprise<BR>
In that dark, dismal hour, amid his crew<BR>
Worse panic and disorder might ensue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Not yet to him have tidings been conveyed,<BR>
That squadrons of such force the billows plow:<BR>
Nor would he have believed in him who said,<BR>
A hundred barks had sprung from one small bough;<BR>
And hence for Africa the king had weighed,<BR>
Not fearing to encounter hostile prow;<BR>
Nor has he watchmen in his tops to spy,<BR>
And make report of what they hence descry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas so those ships, by England&#8217;s peer supplied<BR>
To Dudon, manned with good and armed crew,<BR>
Which see that Moorish fleet at eventide,<BR>
And that strange armament forthwith pursue,<BR>
Assailed them unawares, and, far, and wide,<BR>
Among those barks their grappling-irons threw,<BR>
And linked by chains, to their opponents clung,<BR>
When known for Moors and foemen by their tongue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
In bearing down, impelled by winds that blow<BR>
Propitious to the Danish chief&#8217;s intent,<BR>
Those weighty ships so shocked the paynim foe,<BR>
That many vessels to the bottom went;<BR>
Then, taxing wits and hands, to work them woe,<BR>
Them with fire, sword, and stones the Christians shent;<BR>
Which on their ships in such wide ruin pour,<BR>
Like tempest never vext the sea before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Bold Dudon&#8217;s men, to whom unwonted might<BR>
And daring was imparted from on high,<BR>
(Since the hour was come the paynims to requite<BR>
For more than one ill deed,) from far and nigh,<BR>
The Moors so pestilently gall and smite,<BR>
Agramant finds no shelter; from the sky<BR>
Above, thick clouds of whistling arrows strike;<BR>
Around gleam hook and hatchet, sword and pike.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
The king hears huge and heavy stones descend,<BR>
From charged machine or thundering engine sent,<BR>
Which, falling, poop and prow and broadside rend,<BR>
Opening to ravening seas a mighty vent;<BR>
And more than all the furious fires offend,<BR>
Fires that are quickly kindled, slowly spent,<BR>
The wretched crews would fain that danger shun,<BR>
And ever into direr peril run.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
One headlong plunged, pursued by fire and sword,<BR>
And perished mid the waters, one who wrought<BR>
Faster with arms and feet, his passage oared<BR>
To other barque, already overfraught:<BR>
But she repulsed the wretch that fain would board;<BR>
Whose hand, which too importunately sought<BR>
To clamber, grasped the side, while his lopt arm<BR>
And body stained the wave with life-blood warm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Him, that to save his life i&#8217; the waters thought,<BR>
Or, at the worst, to perish with less pain,<BR>
(Since swimming profited the caitiff nought,<BR>
And he perceived his strength and courage drain)<BR>
To the hungry fires from which the refuge sought,<BR>
The fear of drowning hurries back again:<BR>
He grasps a burning plank, and in the dread<BR>
Of dying either death, by both is sped.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
This vainly to the sea resorts, whom spear<BR>
Or hatchet, brandished close at hand, dismay;<BR>
For stone or arrow following in his rear,<BR>
Permit the craven to make little way.<BR>
But haply, while it yet delights your ear,<BR>
&#8217;Twere well and wisely done to end my lay,<BR>
Rather than harp upon the theme so long<BR>
As to annoy you with a tedious song.</TD></TR>
