Atlantes&#8217; magic towers Astolpho wight<BR>
Destroys, and frees his thralls from prison-cell.<BR>
Bradamant finds Rogero, who in fight<BR>
O&#8217;erthrows four barons from the warlike sell,<BR>
When on their way to save an errant knight<BR>
Doomed to devouring fire: the four who fell<BR>
For impious Pinnabel maintained the strife,<BR>
Whom, after, Bradamant deprives of life.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Ye courteous dames, and to your lovers dear,<BR>
You that are with one single love content;<BR>
Though, &#8217;mid so many and many, it is clear<BR>
Right few of you are of such constant bent;<BR>
Be not displeased at what I said whilere,<BR>
When I so bitterly Gabrina shent,<BR>
Nor if I yet expend some other verse<BR>
In censure of the beldam&#8217;s mind perverse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Such was she; and I hide not what is true;<BR>
So was enjoined me for a task by one<BR>
Whose will is law; therefore is honour due<BR>
To constant heart throughout my story done.<BR>
He who betrayed his master to the Jew<BR>
For thirty pence, nor Peter wronged, nor John,<BR>
Nor less renowned is Hypermnestra&#8217;s fame,<BR>
For her so many wicked sisters&#8217; shame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
For one I dare to censure in my lays,<BR>
For so the story wills which I recite,<BR>
On the other hand, a hundred will I praise,<BR>
And make their virtue dim the sun&#8217;s fair light;<BR>
But turning to the various pile I raise,<BR>
(Gramercy! dear to many) of the knight<BR>
Of Scotland I was telling, who hard-by<BR>
Had heard, as was rehearsed, a piercing cry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
He entered, &#8217;twixt two hills, a narrow way,<BR>
From whence was heard the cry; nor far had hied,<BR>
Ere to a vale he came shut out from day,<BR>
Where he before him a dead knight espied.<BR>
Who I shall tell; but first I must away<BR>
From France, in the Levant to wander wide,<BR>
Till I the paladin Astolpho find,<BR>
Who westward had his course from thence inclined.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
I in the cruel city left the peer,<BR>
Whence, with the formidable bugle&#8217;s roar,<BR>
He had chased the unfaithful people in their fear,<BR>
And has preserved himself from peril sore;<BR>
And with the sound had made his comrades rear<BR>
Then sail, and fly with noted scorn that shore.<BR>
Now following him, I say, the warrior took<BR>
The Armenian road, and so that land forsook.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
He, after some few days, in Natoly<BR>
Finds himself, and towards Brusa goes his ways;<BR>
Hence wending, on the hither side o&#8217; the sea,<BR>
Makes Thrace; through Hungary by the Danube lays<BR>
His course, and as his horse had wings to flee,<BR>
Traverses in less time than twenty days<BR>
Both the Moravian and Bohemian line;<BR>
Threaded Franconia next, and crost the Rhine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
To Aix-la-Chapelle thence, through Arden&#8217;s wood,<BR>
Came and embarked upon the Flemish strand.<BR>
To sea, with southern breeze his vessel stood;<BR>
And, so the favouring wind her canvas fanned,<BR>
That he, at little distance, Albion viewed<BR>
By noon, and disembarked upon her land.<BR>
He backed his horse, and so the rowels plied,<BR>
In London he arrived by even-tide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Here, learning afterwards that Otho old<BR>
Has lain for many months in Paris-town,<BR>
And that anew nigh every baron bold<BR>
Has after his renowned example done,<BR>
He straightway does for France his sails unfold,<BR>
And to the mouth of Thames again is gone.<BR>
Whence issuing forth, with all his canvas spread,<BR>
For Calais he directs the galley&#8217;s head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
A breeze which, from the starboard blowing light,<BR>
Had tempted forth Astolpho&#8217;s bark to sea,<BR>
By little and by little, waxed in might,<BR>
And so at last obtains the mastery,<BR>
The pilot is constrained to veer outright,<BR>
Lest by the billows swampt his frigate be,<BR>
And he, departing from his first design,<BR>
Keeps the bark straight before the cresting brine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Now to the right, now to the other hand,<BR>
Sped by the tempest, through the foaming main,<BR>
The vessel ran; she took the happy land<BR>
At last nigh Rouen; and forthwith, in chain<BR>
And plate Astolpho cased, and girt with brand,<BR>
Bade put the saddle upon Rabicane;<BR>
Departed thence, and (what availed him more<BR>
Than thousands armed) with him his bugle bore;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
And traversing a forest, at the feet<BR>
Of a fair hill, arrived beside a font,<BR>
What time the sheep foregoes his grassy meat,<BR>
Penned in the cabin or the hollow mount;<BR>
And, overcome by feverish thirst and heat,<BR>
Lifted the weighty morion from his front;<BR>
Tethered his courser in the thickest wood,<BR>
And, with intent to drink, approached the flood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
His lips he had not wetted in its bed<BR>
Before a youthful rustic, ambushed near,<BR>
Sprang from a copse, backed Rabican, and fled<BR>
With the good courser of the cavalier.<BR>
Astolpho hears the noise and lifts his head,<BR>
And, when he sees his mighty loss so clear,<BR>
Satiate, although he had not drunk, upstarts,<BR>
And after the young churl in fury darts.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
That robber did not let the courser strain<BR>
At speed, or he had from the warrior shot;<BR>
But loosening now and tightening now the rein,<BR>
Fled at a gallop or a steady trot.<BR>
From the deep forest issued forth the twain,<BR>
After long round, and reached in fine the spot<BR>
Where so many illustrious lords were shent:<BR>
Worse prisoners they than if in prison pent!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
On Rabican, who with the wind might race,<BR>
The villain sped, within the enchanter&#8217;s won.<BR>
Impeded by his shield and iron case,<BR>
Parforce Astolpho far behind him run;<BR>
Yet there arrives as well, but every trace<BR>
Of what the warrior had pursued is gone.<BR>
He neither Rabican nor thief can meet,<BR>
And vainly rolls his eyes and plies his feet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
He plies his feet, and searches still in vain<BR>
Throughout the house, hall, bower, or galleried rows:<BR>
Yet labours evermore, with fruitless pain<BR>
And care, to find the treacherous churl; nor knows<BR>
Where he can have secreted Rabicane,<BR>
Who every other animal outgoes:<BR>
And vainly searches all day the dome about,<BR>
Above, below, within it, and without.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
He, wearied and confused with wandering wide,<BR>
Perceived the place was by enchantment wrought,<BR>
And of the book he carried at his side,<BR>
By Logistilla given in India, thought;<BR>
Bestowed, should new enchantment him betide,<BR>
That needful succour might therein be sought.<BR>
He to the index turns, and quickly sees<BR>
What pages show the proper remedies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
I&#8217; the book, of that enchanted house at large<BR>
Was written, and in this was taught the way<BR>
To foil the enchanter, and to set at large<BR>
The different prisoners, subject to his sway.<BR>
Of these illusions and these frauds in charge,<BR>
A spirit pent beneath the threshold lay;<BR>
And the stone raised which kept him fast below,<BR>
With him the palace into smoke would go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Astolpho with desire to bring to end<BR>
An enterprise so passing fair, delays<BR>
No more, but to the task his force does bend,<BR>
And prove how much the heavy marble weighs.<BR>
As old Atlantes sees the knight intend<BR>
To bring to scorn his art and evil ways,<BR>
Suspicious of the ill which may ensue,<BR>
He moves to assail him with enchantments new.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
He, with his spells and shapes of devilish kind,<BR>
Makes the duke different from his wont appear;<BR>
To one a giant, and to one a hind,<BR>
To other an ill-visaged cavalier;<BR>
Each, in the form which in the thicket blind<BR>
The false enchanter wore, beholds the peer.<BR>
So that they all, with purpose to have back<BR>
What the magician took, the duke attack.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
The Child, Gradasso, Iroldo, Bradamant,<BR>
Prasildo, Brandimart, and many more,<BR>
All, cheated by this new illusion, pant<BR>
To slay the English baron, angered sore;<BR>
But he abased their pride and haughty vaunt,<BR>
Who straight bethought him of the horn be bore.<BR>
But for the succour of its echo dread,<BR>
They, without fail, had laid Astolpho dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
But he no sooner has the bugle wound<BR>
And poured a horrid larum, than in guise<BR>
Of pigeons at the musquet&#8217;s scaring sound,<BR>
The troop of cavaliers affrighted flies.<BR>
No less the necromancer starts astound,<BR>
No less he from his den in panic hies;<BR>
Troubled and pale, and hurrying evermore<BR>
Till out of hearing of the horrid roar</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
The warder fled; with him his prisoned train,<BR>
And many steeds as well are fled and gone;<BR>
(These more than rope is needed to restrain)<BR>
Who after their astounded masters run,<BR>
Scared by the sound; nor cat nor mouse remain,<BR>
Who seem to hear in it, &#8220;Lay on, lay on.&#8221;<BR>
Rabican with the rest had broke his bands,<BR>
But that he fell into Astolpho&#8217;s hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
He, having chased the enchanter Moor away,<BR>
Upraised the heavy threshold from the ground;<BR>
Beneath which, figures and more matters lay,<BR>
That I omit; desirous to confound<BR>
The spell which did the magic dome upstay,<BR>
The duke made havock of whate&#8217;er he found,<BR>
As him the book he carried taught to do:<BR>
And into mist and smoke all past from view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
There he found fastened by a golden chain<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s famous courser, him I say<BR>
Given by the wizard, that to the domain<BR>
Of false Alcina him he might convey:<BR>
On which, equipt with Logistilla&#8217;s rein,<BR>
To France Rogero had retraced his way,<BR>
And had from Ind to England rounded all<BR>
The right-hand side of the terrestrial ball.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
I know not if you recollect how tied<BR>
To a tree Rogero left his rein, the day<BR>
Galaphron&#8217;s naked daughter from his side<BR>
Vanished, and him did with that scorn appay.<BR>
The courser, to his wonder who espied,<BR>
Returned to him whom he was used to obey;<BR>
Beneath the old enchanter&#8217;s care to dwell,<BR>
And stayed with him till broken was the spell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
At nought Astolpho could more joyous be<BR>
Than this; of all things fortunate the best:<BR>
In that the hippogryph so happily<BR>
Offered himself; that he might scower the rest,<BR>
(As much he coveted) of land and sea,<BR>
And in few days the ample world invest.<BR>
Him well he knew, how fit for his behoof;<BR>
For of his feats he had elsewhere made proof.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Him he that day in India proved, when sped<BR>
He was by sage Melissa, from the reign<BR>
Of that ill woman who him, sore bested,<BR>
Had changed from man to myrtle on the plain;<BR>
Had marked and noted how his giddy head<BR>
Was formed by Logistilla to the rein;<BR>
And saw how well instructed by her care<BR>
Rogero was, to guide him every where.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Minded to take the hippogryph, he flung<BR>
The saddle on him, which lay near, and bitted<BR>
The steed, by choosing, all the reins among,<BR>
This part or that, until his mouth was fitted:<BR>
For in that place were many bridles hung,<BR>
Belonging to the coursers which flitted.<BR>
And now alone, intent upon his flight,<BR>
The thought of Rabicane detained the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Good cause he had to love that Rabicane,<BR>
For better horse was not to run with lance,<BR>
And him had he from the remotest reign<BR>
Of India ridden even into France:<BR>
After much thought, he to some friend would fain<BR>
Present him, rather than so, left to chance,<BR>
Abandon there the courser, as a prey,<BR>
To the first stranger who should pass that way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
He stood upon the watch if he could view<BR>
Some hunter in the forest, or some hind,<BR>
To whom he might commit the charge, and who<BR>
Might to some city lead the horse behind.<BR>
He waited all that day and till the new<BR>
Had dawned, when, while the twilight yet was blind,<BR>
He thought he saw, as he expecting stood,<BR>
A cavalier approaching through the wood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
But it behoves that, ere the rest I say,<BR>
I Bradamant and good Rogero find.<BR>
After the horn had ceased, and, far away,<BR>
The beauteous pair had left the dome behind,<BR>
Rogero looked, and knew what till that day<BR>
He had seen not, by Atlantes rendered blind.<BR>
Atlantes had effected by his power,<BR>
They should not know each other till that hour.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Rogero looks on Bradamant, and she<BR>
Looks on Rogero in profound surprise<BR>
That for so many days that witchery<BR>
Had so obscurred her altered mind and eyes.<BR>
Rejoiced, Rogero clasps his lady free,<BR>
Crimsoning with deeper than the rose&#8217;s dyes,<BR>
And his fair love&#8217;s first blossoms, while he clips<BR>
The gentle damsel, gathers from her lips.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
A thousand times they their embrace renew,<BR>
And closely each is by the other prest;<BR>
While so delighted are those lovers two,<BR>
Their joys are ill contained within their breast.<BR>
Deluded by enchantments, much they rue<BR>
That while they were within the wizard&#8217;s rest,<BR>
They should not e&#8217;er have one another known,<BR>
And have so many happy days foregone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
The gentle Bradamant, who was i&#8217; the vein<BR>
To grant whatever prudent virgin might,<BR>
To solace her desiring lover&#8217;s pain,<BR>
So that her honour should receive no slight;<BR>
&#8212;If the last fruits he of her love would gain,<BR>
Nor find her ever stubborn, bade the knight,<BR>
Her of Duke Aymon through fair mean demand;<BR>
But be baptized before he claimed her hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Rogero good, who not alone to be<BR>
A Christian for the love of her were fain,<BR>
As his good sire had been, and anciently<BR>
His grandsire and his whole illustrious strain,<BR>
But for her pleasure would immediately<BR>
Resign whatever did of life remain,<BR>
Says, &#8220;I not only, if &#8217;tis thy desire,<BR>
Will be baptized by water, but by fire.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Then on his way to be baptized he hied,<BR>
That he might next espouse the martial may,<BR>
With Bradamant; who served him as a guide<BR>
To Vallombrosa&#8217;s fane, an abbey gray,<BR>
Rich, fair, nor less religious, and beside,<BR>
Courteous to whosoever passed that way;<BR>
And they encountered, issuing from the chase,<BR>
A woman, with a passing woful face.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Rogero, as still courteous, still humane<BR>
To all, but woman most, when he discerned<BR>
Her dainty visage furrowed by a rain<BR>
Of lovely tears, sore pitied her, and burned<BR>
With the desire to know her grievous pain;<BR>
And having to the mournful lady turned,<BR>
Besought her, after fair salute, to show<BR>
What cause had made her eyes thus overflow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
And she, uplifting their moist rays and bright,<BR>
Most kindly to the inquiring Child replied;<BR>
And of the cause of her unhappy plight,<BR>
Him, since he sought it, fully satisfied.<BR>
&#8220;Thou hast to understand, O gentle knight,<BR>
My visage is so bathed with tears,&#8221; she cried,<BR>
&#8220;In pity to a youth condemned to die<BR>
This very day, within a town hard by.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Loving a gentle lady and a gay,<BR>
The daughter of Marsilius, king of Spain,<BR>
And feigning, veiled in feminine array,<BR>
The modest roll of eye and girlish strain,<BR>
With her each night the amorous stripling lay,<BR>
Nor any had suspicion of the twain:<BR>
But nought so hidden is, but searching eye<BR>
In the long run the secret will espy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;One first perceived it, and then spoke with two,<BR>
Those two with more, till to the king &#8217;twas said;<BR>
Of whom but yesterday a follower true<BR>
Gave order to surprise the pair in bed,<BR>
And in the citadel the prisoners new,<BR>
To separate dungeons in that fortress led;<BR>
Nor think I that enough of day remains<BR>
To save the lover from his cruel pains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I fled, not to behold such cruelty,<BR>
For they alive the wretched youth will burn;<BR>
Nor think I aught could more afflicting be<BR>
Than such fair stripling&#8217;s torment to discern,<BR>
Or that hereafter thing can pleasure me<BR>
So much, but that it will to trouble turn,<BR>
If memory retrace the cruel flame<BR>
Which preyed upon his fair and dainty frame.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
Touched deeply, Bradamant his danger hears,<BR>
In heart sore troubled at the story shown;<BR>
As anxious for the lover, it appears,<BR>
As if he were a brother of her own:<BR>
Nor certes wholly causeless are her fears,<BR>
As in an after verse will be made known,<BR>
Then, to Rogero: &#8220;Him to keep from harms,<BR>
Meseems we worthily should turn our arms.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
And to that melancholy damsel said:<BR>
&#8220;Place us but once within the walls, and I,<BR>
So that the youth be not already dead,<BR>
Will be your warrant that he shall not die.&#8221;<BR>
Rogero, who the kindly bosom read<BR>
Of Bradamant, still full of piety,<BR>
Felt himself but all over with desire<BR>
To snatch the unhappy stripling from the fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
And to the maid, whose troubled face apears<BR>
Bathed with a briny flood, &#8220;Why wait we?&#8212;need<BR>
Is here of speedy succour, not of tears.<BR>
Do you but where the youth is prisoned lead;<BR>
Him from a thousand swords, a thousand spears,<BR>
We vow to save; so it be done with speed.<BR>
But haste you, lest too tardy be our aid,<BR>
And he be burnt, which succour is delayed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
The haughty semblance and the lofty say<BR>
Of these, who with such wondrous daring glowed,<BR>
That hope, which long had ceased to be her stay,<BR>
Again upon the grieving dame bestowed:<BR>
But, for she less the distance of the way<BR>
Dreaded, than interruption of the road,<BR>
Lest they, through this, should take that path in vain,<BR>
The damsel stood suspended and in pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Then said: &#8220;If to the place our journey lay<BR>
By the highroad, which is both straight and plain,<BR>
That we in time might reach it, I should say,<BR>
Before the fire was lit; but we must strain<BR>
By path so foul and crooked, that a day<BR>
To reach the city would suffice with pain;<BR>
And when, alas! we thither shall have sped,<BR>
I fear that we shall find the stripling dead.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And wherefore take we not the way most near?&#8221;<BR>
Rogero answers; and the dame replies,<BR>
&#8220;Because fast by where we our course should steer,<BR>
A castle of the Count of Poictiers lies:<BR>
Where Pinnabel for dame and cavalier<BR>
Did, three days past, a shameful law devise;<BR>
Than whom more worthless living wight is none,<BR>
The Count Anselmo d&#8217;Altaripa&#8217;s son.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No cavalier or lady by that rest<BR>
Without some noted scorn and injury goes;<BR>
Both of their coursers here are dispossest,<BR>
And knight his arms and dame her gown foregoes.<BR>
No better cavaliers lay lance in rest,<BR>
Nor have for years in France against their foes,<BR>
Than four, who for Sir Pinnabel have plight<BR>
Their promise to maintain the castle&#8217;s right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whence first arose the usage, which began<BR>
But three days since, you now, sir knight, shall hear;<BR>
And shall the cause, if right or evil, scan,<BR>
Which moved the banded cavaliers to swear.<BR>
So ill a lady has the Castellan,<BR>
So wayward, that she is without a peer:<BR>
Who, on a day, as with the count she went,<BR>
I know not whither, by a knight was shent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This knight, as flouted by that bonnibel,<BR>
For carrying on his croup an ancient dame,<BR>
Encountered with her champion Pinnabel,<BR>
Of overweening pride and little fame:<BR>
Him he o&#8217;erturned, made alight as well,<BR>
And put her to the proof, if sound or lame;<BR>
&#8212;Left her on foot, and had that woman old<BR>
In the dismounted damsel&#8217;s garment stoled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She, who remained on foot, in fell despite,<BR>
Greedy of vengeance, and athirst for ill,<BR>
Leagued with the faithless Pinnabel, a wight<BR>
All evil prompt to further and fulfil,<BR>
Says she shall never rest by day nor night,<BR>
Nor ever know a happy hour, until<BR>
A thousand knights and dames are dispossest<BR>
Of courser, and of armour, and of vest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Four puissant knights arrived that very day<BR>
It happened, at a place of his, and who<BR>
Had all of them from regions far away<BR>
Come lately to those parts: so many true<BR>
And valiant warriors, skilled in martial play,<BR>
Our age has seen not. These the goodly crew:<BR>
Guido the savage, but a stripling yet,<BR>
Gryphon, and Aquilant, and Sansonet!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Them at the fortilage, of which I told,<BR>
Sir Pinnabel received with semblance fair,<BR>
Next seized the ensuing night the warriors bold<BR>
In bed, nor loosed, till he had made them swear<BR>
That (he such period fixt) they in his hold<BR>
Should be his faithful champions for a year<BR>
And month; and of his horse and arms deprive<BR>
Whatever cavalier should there arrive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And any damsel whom the stranger bore<BR>
With him, dismount, and strip her of her vest.<BR>
So, thus surprised, the warlike prisoners swore;<BR>
So were constrained to observe the cruel hest,<BR>
Though grieved and troubled: nor against the four,<BR>
It seems, can any joust, but vails his crest.<BR>
Knight infinite have come, but one and all,<BR>
Afoot and without arms have left that Hall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Their order is, who from the castle hies,<BR>
The first by lot, shall meet the foe alone,<BR>
But if he find a champion of such guise<BR>
As keeps the sell, while he himself is thrown,<BR>
The rest must undertake the enterprise,<BR>
Even to the death, against that single one,<BR>
Ranged in a band. If such each single knight,<BR>
Imagine the assembled warriors&#8217; might!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor stands it with our haste, which all delay,<BR>
All let forbids, that you beside that tower<BR>
Be forced to stop and mingle in the fray:<BR>
For grant that you be conquerors in the stower,<BR>
(And as your presence warrants well, you may,)<BR>
&#8217;Tis not a thing concluded in an hour.<BR>
And if all day he wait our succour, I<BR>
Much fear the stripling in the fire will die.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Regard we not this hindrance of our quest,&#8221;<BR>
Rogero cried, &#8220;But do we what we may!<BR>
Let HIM who rules the heavens ordain the rest,<BR>
Or Fortune, if he leave it in her sway;<BR>
To you shall by this joust be manifest<BR>
If we can aid the youth; for whom to-day<BR>
They on a ground so causeless and so slight,<BR>
As you to us rehearsed, the fire will light.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero ceased; and in the nearest way<BR>
The damsel put the pair without reply:<BR>
Nor these beyond three miles had fared, when they<BR>
Reached bridge and gate, the place of forfeitry,<BR>
Of horse and arms and feminine array,<BR>
With peril sore of life. On turret high,<BR>
Upon first sight of them, a sentinel<BR>
Beat twice upon the castle&#8217;s larum-bell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
And lo, in eager hurry from the gate<BR>
An elder trotting on hackney made!<BR>
And he approaching cried, &#8220;Await, await!<BR>
&#8212;Hola! halt, sirs, for here a fine is paid:<BR>
And I to you the usage shall relate,<BR>
If this has not to you before been said.&#8221;<BR>
And to the three forthwith began to tell<BR>
The use established there by Pinnabel.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
He next proceeds, as he had wont before<BR>
To counsel other errant cavalier.<BR>
&#8220;Unrobe the lady,&#8221; (said the elder hoar,)<BR>
&#8220;My sons, and leave your steeds and martial geer;<BR>
Nor put yourselves in peril, and with four<BR>
Such matchless champions hazard the career.<BR>
Clothes, arms, and coursers every where are rife;<BR>
But not to be repaired is loss of life.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8212;No more!&#8221; (Rogero said) &#8220;No more! for I<BR>
Am well informed of all, and hither speed<BR>
With the intention, here by proof to try<BR>
If, what my heart has vouched, I am in deed.<BR>
For sign or threat I yield not panoply,<BR>
If nought beside I hear, nor vest nor steed.<BR>
And this my comrade, I as surely know,<BR>
These for mere words as little will forego.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But let me face to face, by Heaven, espy<BR>
Those who would take my horse and arms away;<BR>
For we have yet beyond that hill to hie,<BR>
And little time can here afford to stay.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;Behold the man,&#8221; that ancient made reply,<BR>
&#8220;Clear of the bridge!&#8221;&#8212;Nor did in this missay;<BR>
For thence a warrior pricked, who, powdered o&#8217;er<BR>
With snowy flowers, a crimson surcoat wore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Bradamant for long time with earnest prayer,<BR>
For courtesy the good Rogero prest,<BR>
To let her from his sell the warrior bear,<BR>
Who with white flowers had purfled o&#8217;er his vest.<BR>
But moved him not; and to Rogero&#8217;s share<BR>
Must leave, and do herself, what liked him best.<BR>
He willed the whole emprize his own should be,<BR>
And Bradamant should stand apart to see.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
The Child demanded of that elder, who<BR>
Was he that from the gate first took his way,<BR>
And he, &#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis Sansonet; of crimson hue,<BR>
I know his surcoat, with white flowers gay.&#8221;<BR>
Without a word exchanged, the warlike two<BR>
Divide the ground, and short is the delay.<BR>
For they against each other, levelling low<BR>
Their spears, and hurrying sore their coursers, go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
This while had issued from the fortress near,<BR>
With many footmen girt, Sir Pinnabel,<BR>
All ready to despoil the cavalier,<BR>
Who in the warlike joust should void is sell.<BR>
At one another spurred in bold career<BR>
The knights, with their huge lances rested well.<BR>
Up to the points nigh equal was each stick,<BR>
Of stubborn native oak, and two palms thick.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Sansonet, of such staves, above five pair<BR>
Had made them sever from the living stock,<BR>
In neighboring wood, and bade his followers bear<BR>
Two of them hither, destined for that shock:<BR>
Such truncheons to withstand, well needed-were<BR>
A shield and cuirass of the diamond rock.<BR>
One he had made them give his foe, and one<BR>
He kept himself, the present course to run.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
With these which might the solid anvil bore,<BR>
(So well their ends were pointed) there and here,<BR>
Each aiming at the shield his foeman wore,<BR>
The puissant warriors shocked in mid career.<BR>
That of Rogero, wrought with magic lore,<BR>
By fiends, had little from the stroke to fear:<BR>
I of the buckler speak Atlantes made,<BR>
Of whose rare virtues I whilere have said.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
I have already said, the enchanted light<BR>
Strikes with such force on the beholder&#8217;s eyes,<BR>
That, at the shield&#8217;s discovery, every wight<BR>
Is blinded, or on earth half lifeless lies.<BR>
Wherefore, well mantled with a veil, the knight<BR>
Keeps it, unless some passing need surprise:<BR>
Impassive is the shield as well believed,<BR>
Since it no damage in the shock received.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
The other by less skilful artist wrought,<BR>
Did not so well that weightless blow abide,<BR>
But, as if smit by thunder, in a thought,<BR>
Gave way before the steel, and opened wide;<BR>
Gave way before the griding steel, which sought<BR>
The arm beneath, by this ill fortified:<BR>
So that Sir Sansonet was smote, and reeled,<BR>
In his departure, unhorsed upon the field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
And this was the first comrade of the train<BR>
That of the tower maintained the usage fell,<BR>
Who there had failed another&#8217;s spoil to gain,<BR>
And voided in the joust his knightly sell.<BR>
Who laughs, as well will sometimes have to plain,<BR>
And find that Fortune will by fits rebel.<BR>
Anew the warder on his larum beats,<BR>
And to the other knights the sign repeats.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
This while Sir Pinnabello had drawn near<BR>
To Bradamant, and prayed that she would shew<BR>
What warrior had his knight in the career<BR>
Smith with such prowess. That the guerdon due<BR>
To his ill deeds might wait the cavalier,<BR>
God&#8217;s justice that ill-doer thither drew<BR>
On the same courser, which before the Cheat<BR>
From Bradamant had taken by deceit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas now exactly the eighth month was ended,<BR>
Since, if you recollect, upon his way,<BR>
The faithless Maganzese, with whom she wended,<BR>
Cast into Merlin&#8217;s tomb the martial may;<BR>
When her a bough, which fell with her, defended<BR>
From death, or her good Fortune, rather say;<BR>
And Pinnabel bore off her courser brave,<BR>
Deeming the damsel buried in the cave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
The courser, and, through him, the cavalier,<BR>
Bradamant knew to be the wicked Count,<BR>
And, having heard him, and perused him near,<BR>
With more attentive eye and front to front&#8212;<BR>
&#8220;This is the man,&#8221; (the damsel said) &#8220;&#8201;&#8217;tis clear,<BR>
Who erst designed me outrage and affront.<BR>
Lo! him the traitor&#8217;s sin doth hither speed,<BR>
Of all his treasons to receive the meed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
To threaten him with vengeance, and to lay<BR>
Hands on her sword and charge him now, was done<BR>
All in a thought; but first she barred the way<BR>
By which he might his fortilage have won.<BR>
To earth himself like fox, in his dismay,<BR>
Sir Pinnabel has every hope foregone.<BR>
He screaming loud, nor ever making head<BR>
Against the damsel, through the forest fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Pale and dismayed his spurs the caitiff plied<BR>
Whose last hope of escape in flight was found;<BR>
While with her ready sword, Dordona&#8217;s pride<BR>
Was at his flank, and prest him in his round,<BR>
Hunting him close and ever fast beside:<BR>
Loud is the uproar, and the woods resound.<BR>
Nothing of this is at the castle kenned,<BR>
For only to Rogero all attend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
The other three, who from the fortress came,<BR>
This while had issued forth upon their way,<BR>
And brought with them the ill-accustomed dame,<BR>
Who made wayfarers that ill use obey.<BR>
In all (who rather than prolong with blame<BR>
Their life, would choose to perish in the fray),<BR>
The kindling visage burns, and heart is woe,<BR>
That to assail one man so many go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
The cruel courtezan by whom was made,<BR>
And by whose hest maintained, that evil rite,<BR>
Reminds the warriors that they are arrayed<BR>
By oath and pact, to avenge her in the fight.<BR>
&#8220;If with this lance alone thy foes are laid<BR>
On earth, why should I band with other knight?&#8221;<BR>
(Guido the savage said) &#8220;and, if I lie,<BR>
Off with my head, for I consent to die.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
So Aquilant, so Gryphon. For the twain<BR>
Singly against a single foe would run;<BR>
And rather would be taken, rather slain,<BR>
Than he should be assailed by more than one.<BR>
To them exclaimed the woman: &#8220;Why in vain<BR>
Waste you so many words, where fruit is none?<BR>
I brought you here that champion&#8217;s arms to take,<BR>
Not other laws and other pacts to make.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You should have offered, when in prison-cell,<BR>
This your excuse; which now too late is made.<BR>
&#8217;Tis yours the law&#8217;s observance to compel,<BR>
And not with lying tongue your oath evade.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;&#8212;Behold! the arms; behold, with a new sell<BR>
And cloth, the goodly steed!&#8221; Rogero said,<BR>
&#8220;Behold with these, as well, the damsel&#8217;s vest!<BR>
If these you covet, why your course arrest?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
She of the castle presses on this side,<BR>
On that Rogero rates, and calls them on;<BR>
Till they parforce, t&#8217;wards him, together hied:<BR>
But red with shame, are to the encounter gone.<BR>
Foremost appeared &#8217;mid those three knights of pride,<BR>
Of Burgundy&#8217;s good marquis either son.<BR>
But Guido, who was borne on heavier steed,<BR>
Came at some interval, with tardier speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
With the same lance with which he overbore<BR>
Sir Sansonet, Rogero came to fight;<BR>
Well-covered with the shield which heretofore<BR>
Atlantes used on Pyrenean height;<BR>
I say the enchanted buckler, which, too sore<BR>
For human sufferance, dazed the astonished sight:<BR>
To which Rogero, as a last resource,<BR>
In the most pressing peril had recourse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Although three times alone the Child was fain<BR>
(And, certes sore bested) this to display;<BR>
Twice when he from the wanton Fairy&#8217;s reign<BR>
Was to that soberer region on his way!<BR>
Last, when the unsated Orc upon the main,<BR>
By this astounded, &#8217;mid the sea-foam lay;<BR>
Which would have fed upon the naked maid,<BR>
So cruel to the Child who brought her aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Save these three times, he has preserved the shield<BR>
Beneath its veil, but covered in such wise<BR>
That it may quickly be to sight revealed,<BR>
If he in need of its good succour lies.<BR>
With this, as said before, he came a-field<BR>
As boldly, as if those three enemies,<BR>
Who were arrayed before him, had appeared<BR>
Yet less than little children to be feared.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Rogero shocked the valiant Gryphon, where<BR>
The border of the buckler joined the sight,<BR>
Who seemed as he would fall, now here, now there,<BR>
And, from his courser far, last fell outright.<BR>
He at the shield had aimed, but smote not fair<BR>
The mark; and (for Rogero&#8217;s orb was bright<BR>
And smooth) the hissing weapon slipt, and wrought<BR>
Other effect than was in Gryphon&#8217;s thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
It rent and tore the veil which served to hide<BR>
The lightning&#8217;s fearful and enchanted rays;<BR>
Which, without blinded eyes, can none abide<BR>
Upright, nor refuge is for them who gaze.<BR>
Aquilant, who was at his brother&#8217;s side,<BR>
Tore off the rest, and made the buckler blaze:<BR>
The splendour struck the valiant brothers blind,<BR>
And Guido in their rear, who spurred behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
These here, or there, to earth astonished reel;<BR>
Nor eyes alone are dazzled by the light,<BR>
But every sense astounds the flaming steel.<BR>
Unconscious of the issue of the fight,<BR>
Rogero turned his horse, and, in the wheel,<BR>
Handled his sword, so good to thrust and smite;<BR>
And none descried his fury to oppose;<BR>
For in the charge dismounted were his foes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
The knights, together with the footmen all,<BR>
And women, who had from the castle hied,<BR>
Nor less the coursers panting with their fall,<BR>
As if about to die, the warrior spied.<BR>
He wondered first, and next perceived the pall<BR>
Of silk was handing down on the left side;<BR>
I say the pall, in which he used to lap<BR>
His shield, the evil cause of that mishap.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
He quickly turns, and, turning, rolls his eyes,<BR>
In hopes to view his well-loved martial maid;<BR>
And thitherward, without delay, he hies<BR>
Where, when the joust began, the damsel stayed.<BR>
Not finding her, it is the Child&#8217;s surmise<BR>
That she is gone to bear the stripling aid;<BR>
Fearing he may be burnt, while they their journey<BR>
So long delay, retarded by that tourney.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
He saw the damsel, stretched among the rest<BR>
Who him had thither guided: as she lay,<BR>
He took and placed her, yet with sleep opprest,<BR>
Before him, and, sore troubled, rode away.<BR>
He with a mantle, which above her vest<BR>
She wore, concealed the enchanted buckler&#8217;s ray:<BR>
And to the maid restored, when &#8217;twas concealed,<BR>
Her senses, which were ravished by the shield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Away Rogero posted with the dame,<BR>
And did not date his crimsoned visage raise;<BR>
Since every one, it seemed to him, might blame<BR>
With right that victory, worthy little praise.<BR>
&#8220;By what amends can I of such a shame<BR>
(The blushing warrior said) the stain eraze?<BR>
For &#8217;twill be bruited, all my deeds by sleight<BR>
Of magic have been done, and not by might.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
As, thinking thus, he journeyed on his way,<BR>
Rogero stumbled upon what he sought;<BR>
For, in the middle of the track, there lay<BR>
A well, within the ground profoundly wrought:<BR>
Whither the thirsty herd, at noon of day,<BR>
Repaired, their paunches with green forage fraught.<BR>
Rogero said, &#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis now, must I provide,<BR>
I shame from thee, O shield, no more abide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thee will I keep no more, and this shall be<BR>
Even the last shame which so on me is thrown:&#8221;<BR>
The Child, so ending his self-colloquy,<BR>
Dismounting, takes a large and heavy stone;<BR>
Which to the shield he ties, and bodily<BR>
Both to the bottom of the well are gone.<BR>
&#8220;Lie buried there for ever, from all eyes,<BR>
And with thee hidden be my shame!&#8221; he cries.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Filled to the brim with water was the well;<BR>
Heavy the stone, and heavy was the shield;<BR>
Nor stopt they till they to the bottom fell,<BR>
By the light, liquid element concealed.<BR>
Fame was not slow the noble act to swell,<BR>
But, wandering wide, the deed in brief revealed,<BR>
And voicing it abroad, with trumpet-sound,<BR>
Told France and Spain and all the countries round.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
When that so strange adventure to the rest<BR>
Of the wide world, from mouth to mouth was blown,<BR>
Knights out of number undertook the quest,<BR>
From neighbouring parts and distant; but unknown<BR>
To all remained the forest which possessed<BR>
The spring wherein the virtuous shield was thrown:<BR>
For she who told the action, would not say<BR>
Where was the well, nor in what land it lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Upon Rogero&#8217;s parting thence, where fell<BR>
The four good champions of that evil law,<BR>
Made by the castle&#8217;s lord Sir Pinnabel,<BR>
By him discomfited like men of straw,<BR>
&#8212;The shield withdrawn&#8212;he had removed as well<BR>
The light, which quelled their sight and minds who saw;<BR>
And those, who, like dead men, on earth had lain,<BR>
Had risen, full of wonderment, again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Nor any thing throughout that livelong day<BR>
They &#8217;mid themselves but that strange case relate;<BR>
And how it was in that disastrous fray<BR>
Each by the horrid light was quelled, debate.<BR>
While these, discoursing, of the adventure say,<BR>
Tidings are brought of Pinnabello&#8217;s fate.<BR>
That Pinnabel is dead the warriors hear,<BR>
But learn not who had slain the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Bradamant in close pass, this while, had staid<BR>
The faithless Pinnabel, and sorely prest;<BR>
And many times had buried half her blade<BR>
Within bleeding flanks and heaving breast.<BR>
When of his crimes the forfeit had been paid<BR>
By him, the infected country&#8217;s curse and pest,<BR>
She from the conscious forest turned away<BR>
With that good steed the thief had made his prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
She would return where she had left the knight,<BR>
But never could make out the road anew;<BR>
And now by valley, now by mountain-height,<BR>
Wandered well-nigh the ample country through.<BR>
Yet could she never (such her fortune&#8217;s spite)<BR>
Find out the way to join Rogero true.<BR>
Him in another canto I attend<BR>
Who loves the tale, to hear my story&#8217;s end.</TD></TR>
