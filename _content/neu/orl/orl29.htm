<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Isabel makes the paynim take her head,<BR>
Rather than he his wicked will should gain;<BR>
Who, having his unhappy error read,<BR>
Seeks to appease his wounded spirit in vain.<BR>
He builds a bridge, and strips those thither led;<BR>
But falls from it with Roland the insane;<BR>
Who thence, of him regardless, endlong speeds,<BR>
And by the road achieves prodigious deeds.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
O feeble and unstable minds of men!<BR>
How quickly our intentions fluctuate!<BR>
All thoughts we lightly change, but mostly when<BR>
These from some lover&#8217;s quarrel take their date.<BR>
But now, so wroth I saw that Saracen<BR>
With woman, so outrageous in his hate,<BR>
I weened not only he would ill assuage,<BR>
But never more would calm, his amorous rage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
That which he rashly uttered to your blame,<BR>
Ye gentle dames, does so my spirit grieve,<BR>
Till I his error teach him, to his shame,<BR>
He shall no quarter at my hands receive;<BR>
So him with pen and page will I proclaim,<BR>
That, whosoever reads me, shall believe<BR>
He had better held&#8212;aye, better bit, his tongue,<BR>
Than ever have your sex with slander stung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
But that in this the witless infidel<BR>
Spake as a fool, the event demonstrates clear:<BR>
Even now, with dagger drawn, that paynim fell<BR>
In fury on all women whomsoe&#8217;er.<BR>
Next him so touched one look of Isabel,<BR>
She quickly made his fickle purpose veer;<BR>
For her, scarce seen, and to that warrior strange,<BR>
He would his Doralice already change;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
And, as new love the king did heat and goad,<BR>
He moved some arguments of small avail,<BR>
To shake her stedfast spirit, which abode<BR>
Wholly with God; but he, her shield and mail,<BR>
That hermit, lest she from the better road<BR>
Should wander, and her chaste intention fail,<BR>
With stronger arguments with him contended,<BR>
And still, as best he could, the dame defended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
The king, who long had taxed himself to bear<BR>
The monk&#8217;s bold sermon to his sore displeasure,<BR>
And vainly bade him to his cell repair<BR>
Anew, without that damsel, at his leisure,<BR>
Yet seeing he would still his patience dare,<BR>
Nor peace with him would keep, nor any measure,<BR>
Upon that preacher&#8217;s chin his right-hand laid,<BR>
And whatsoe&#8217;er he grasped, as rudely flayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
And (so his fury waxed) that, as it were<BR>
With tongs, he griped his neck, and after he<BR>
Had whirled him once or twice about in air,<BR>
Dismist him form his hand towards the sea.<BR>
I say not&#8212;know not, what befel him there:<BR>
Many the rumours are, and disagree.<BR>
One says he burst upon a rock&#8217;s rude bed,<BR>
And lay one shapeless jelly, heels and head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
He fell into the sea, by one is said,<BR>
Distant three miles and more; and, in that sound,<BR>
He having prayer, and Ave vainly made,<BR>
Because he knew not how to swim, was drowned.<BR>
Others report a Saint bestowed his aid,<BR>
And dragged him with a visible hand aground.<BR>
Whichever be the reading of this mystery,<BR>
Of him I speak no further in mine history.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Cruel King Rodomont, when from his side<BR>
He had removed the prating eremite,<BR>
With visage less disturbed, again applied<BR>
To that sad lady, heartless with affright;<BR>
And, in the language used by lovers, cried,<BR>
She was his very heart, his life, his light,<BR>
She was his comfort, and his dearest hope;<BR>
With all such words as have that common scope.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
And now, so temperate showed that infidel,<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem that he no violence designed,<BR>
The gentle semblance of fair Isabel,<BR>
Enamoured him, so tamed his haughty mind;<BR>
And, though he might that goodly kernel shell,<BR>
The paynim would not pass beyond the rhind,<BR>
Who that its favour would be lost, believed,<BR>
Unless &#8217;twere as a gift from her received;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
And by degrees so thought to mould the dame<BR>
To his desires. She in that lone retreat<BR>
And savage, open to his evil aim,<BR>
And like a mouse, beneath Grimalkin&#8217;s feet,<BR>
Had liefer found herself i&#8217; the midst of flame;<BR>
And ever on one thought her fancy beat:<BR>
If any mode, if any way, remained<BR>
To scape that wilful man, untouched, unstained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Sad Isabella in her mind is bent<BR>
To slay herself with her own hand, before<BR>
That fell barbarian compass his intent;<BR>
And be the means to make her wrong so sore<BR>
That cavalier, by cruel Fortune spent,<BR>
Within her loving arms, to whom she swore<BR>
With mind to him devoted, his to be,<BR>
Vowing to Heaven perpetual chastity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
She sees that paynim monarch&#8217;s passion blind<BR>
Increasing still, nor what to do she knows;<BR>
Well knows what foul intention is behind,<BR>
Which she is all too feeble to oppose:<BR>
Yet moving many matters in her mind,<BR>
Finds out at last a refuge for her woes,<BR>
And means to save her chastity from shame,<BR>
(How I shall say) with clear and lasting fame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
She cried unto that paynim, foul to see,<BR>
Already threatening her with word and act,<BR>
And now devoid of all that courtesy,<BR>
Which he in the beginning did enact,<BR>
&#8220;If thou mine honour wilt ensure to me,<BR>
Beyond suspicion, I, upon this pact,<BR>
Will upon thee bestow what shall o&#8217;erpay,<BR>
By much, that honour thou wouldst take away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For pleasure, which endures so brief a space,<BR>
Wherewith this ample world does so o&#8217;errun,<BR>
Reject not lightly a perpetual grace,<BR>
A real joy, to be postponed to none.<BR>
Of women everywhere of pleasing face<BR>
A hundred and a thousand may be won;<BR>
But none beside me, or few others, live<BR>
Who can bestow the boon which I can give.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I know, and on my way a herb did view,<BR>
And nearly know where I on this could light,<BR>
Which, being boiled with ivy and with rue,<BR>
Over a fire with wood of cypress dight,<BR>
And squeezed, when taken from the caldron, through<BR>
Innocent hands, affords a juice of might,<BR>
Wherewith whoever thrice his body laves,<BR>
Destructive steel or fire securely braves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If thrice therewith he bathe himself, I say,<BR>
His flesh no weapon for a month shall score:<BR>
He once a month must to his body lay<BR>
Mine unction, for its virtue lasts not more:<BR>
This liquor can I make, and will to-day,<BR>
And thou to-day shalt also prove my lore:<BR>
And well, I trust, thou shalt more grateful be,<BR>
Than were all Europe won to-day by thee.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In guerdon for this present, I request<BR>
That thou to me upon thy faith wilt swear,<BR>
Thou never wilt my chastity molest<BR>
In word or deed.&#8221; So spake that damsel fair;<BR>
And Rodomont who heard, again represt<BR>
His evil will: for so he longed to bear<BR>
A charmed life, that readily he more<BR>
Than Isabel of him demanded swore;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
And will maintain his promise, till the fact<BR>
Vouched of that wondrous water shall appear;<BR>
And force himself, meanwhile, to do no act,<BR>
To show no sign of violence; but the peer<BR>
Resolves he will not after keep the pact,<BR>
As one who holds not God or saint in fear;<BR>
And to that king, regardless of his oath,<BR>
All lying Afric yields in breach of troth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Argier&#8217;s perfidious king to Isabel<BR>
More than a thousand times assurance swore,<BR>
In case that water rendered him what fell<BR>
Achilles and what Cygnus were of yore.<BR>
She, aye by beetling cliff and darksome dell,<BR>
Away from city and from farm, a store<BR>
Of herbs collected, nor this while e&#8217;er<BR>
Abandoned by the paynim cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
When herbs enow by them in many a beat,<BR>
With or without their roots, collected were,<BR>
At a late hour, the twain to their retreat<BR>
Betook them; and, throughout night&#8217;s remnant, there,<BR>
That paragon of continence did heat<BR>
What simples she had culled, with mickle care,<BR>
While to those mysteries and her every deed<BR>
The pagan, present still, gave curious heed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Who, wearing out the weary night in sport,<BR>
&#8212;He and those followers that with him remained&#8212;<BR>
Had suffered thirst in such a grievous sort,<BR>
From the fierce fire in that small cave contained,<BR>
That drinking round, in measure full or short,<BR>
Of Graecian wine two barrels had they drained;<BR>
A booty which those squires who served the Moor,<BR>
From travellers seized a day or two before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
To Argier&#8217;s warlike king, unused to wine,<BR>
(Cursed, and forbidden by his law, esteemed)<BR>
The liquor, tasted once, appeared divine,<BR>
Sweeter than nectar or than manna seemed:<BR>
He, quaffing largely, now of Ishmael&#8217;s line<BR>
The sober use deserving censure deemed.<BR>
So fast their cups with that good wine they fill,<BR>
Each reveller&#8217;s head is whirling like a mill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile that lady from the fire does lift<BR>
The pot, wherein she cooked those herbs, and cries<BR>
To Rodomont: &#8220;In proof I not adrift<BR>
Have launched the words I spake, in random guise,<BR>
&#8212;By that, which can the truth form falsehood sift,<BR>
Experience, which can make the foolish wise,<BR>
Even now the thing shall to thyself be shown,<BR>
Not on another&#8217;s body, but my own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I first will trial make&#8221; (that lady said)<BR>
&#8220;Of this choice liquor with rare virtue blest;<BR>
Lest haply thou shouldst harbour any dread<BR>
That mortal poison form these herbs be prest.<BR>
With this will I anoint myself, from head<BR>
Downwards below the naked neck and breast.<BR>
Then prove on me thy faulchion and thine arm,<BR>
And prove if one can smite, the other harm.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
She washed, as said, and gladly did decline<BR>
Her neck to that unthinking pagan&#8217;s brand;<BR>
Unthinking, and perhaps o&#8217;ercome by wine,<BR>
Which neither helm, nor mail, nor shield withstand,<BR>
That brutish man believed her, and, in sign<BR>
Of faith, so struck with cruel steel and hand,<BR>
That her fair head, erewhile Love&#8217;s place of rest,<BR>
He severed from the snowy neck and breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
This made three bounds, and thence in accents clear<BR>
Was heard a voice which spake Zerbino&#8217;s name,<BR>
To follow whom, escaping Sarza&#8217;s peer,<BR>
So rare a way was taken by the dame.<BR>
Spirit! which nobly didst esteem more dear<BR>
Thy plighted faith, and chaste and holy name,<BR>
(Things hardly known, and foreign to our time)<BR>
Than thine own life and thine own blooming prime!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Depart in peace, O spirit blest and fair!<BR>
&#8212;So had my verses power! as evermore<BR>
I would assay, with all that happy care,<BR>
Which so adorns and points poetic lore!<BR>
And, as renowned should be thy story rare,<BR>
Thousands and thousands of long years and more!<BR>
&#8212;Depart in peace to radiant realms above,<BR>
And leave to earth the example of thy love!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
His eyes from heaven did the Creator bend,<BR>
At the stupendous and unequalled feat,<BR>
And said: &#8220;I thee above that dame commend.<BR>
Whose death drove Tarquin from his royal seat;<BR>
And I to register a law intend,<BR>
&#8217;Mid those which ages change not as they fleet,<BR>
Which&#8212;I attest the inviolable river&#8212;<BR>
Unchanged through future times, shall last for ever.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I will that all, in every future age,<BR>
Who bear thy name, be blest with genius high;<BR>
Be courteous, gentle, beautiful, and sage,<BR>
And to the real pitch of honour fly.<BR>
That to their glory the historic page<BR>
They may with worthy argument supply;<BR>
So that for aye Parnassus&#8217; hill and well<BR>
Shall ring with Isabel and Isabel.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
So spake the Sire; and cleared the ambient air,<BR>
And hushed beyond its wont the heaving main.<BR>
To the third heaven her chaste soul made repair,<BR>
And in Zerbino&#8217;s arms was locked again.<BR>
On earth, with shame and sorrow for his share,<BR>
That second Breuse sans pity did remain;<BR>
Who, when digested was the maddening bowl,<BR>
Lamented sore his error, sad at soul.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
That placated, or in some content,<BR>
The sainted soul of Isabel might be;<BR>
That, if to death that damsel he had shent,<BR>
He might at least revive her memory,<BR>
He, as a means to compass his intent,<BR>
Would turn into a tomb that church, where he<BR>
Inhabited, and where she buried lies;<BR>
To you shall be related in what wise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
In all parts round about this chosen site,<BR>
For love or fear, he master-masons found;<BR>
And, making full six thousand men unite,<BR>
Stript of their heavy stones the mountains round,<BR>
And raised a fabric ninety yards in height,<BR>
From its extremest summit to the ground;<BR>
And he within its walls the church enclosed;<BR>
Wherein entombed the lovers twain reposed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
This nearly imitates that pile beside<BR>
Old Tyber&#8217;s stream, by Adrian built; and nigh<BR>
The sepulchre, will he a tower provide,<BR>
Wherein he purposes some time to lie.<BR>
A narrow bridge, and only two yards wide,<BR>
He flung across the stream which rolled fast by.<BR>
Long, but so scanty is that bridge, with pain<BR>
The narrow pass two coursers can contain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Two coursers, that abreast have thither made,<BR>
Or else, encountering, on that causeway meet:<BR>
Nor any where was ledge or barricade,<BR>
To stay the horses&#8217;s fall, who lost his feet.<BR>
He wills that bridge&#8217;s toll be dearly paid<BR>
By Christian or by Moor, who pass his seat;<BR>
For with a thousand trophies, arms, and vest,<BR>
That damsel&#8217;s tomb is destined to be drest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Within ten days, or shorter time, was placed<BR>
The bridge, whose arch across the stream was dight;<BR>
But not that pile and tower with equal haste<BR>
Were so conducted to their destined height.<BR>
Yet was the last so high, a sentry paced<BR>
Its top, who, whensoever any knight<BR>
Approached the bridge, was wont his lord to warn,<BR>
Sounding a signal on his bugle-horn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Whereat he armed, and issued for the stower,<BR>
Now upon one and now the other side:<BR>
For when a warrior pricked towards the tower,<BR>
Him from the adverse bank that king defied:<BR>
The bridge affords the field their steeds must scour;<BR>
And, should one but a little swerve aside,<BR>
(Peril unparalleled!) the horse will go<BR>
Into the deep and dangerous stream below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
The pagan had imagined, as a pain,<BR>
That, risking oft to tumble in the course,<BR>
Head-first into that stream, where he must drain<BR>
Huge draughts of water in his fall, parforce,<BR>
He would assoil and cleanse him from that stain,<BR>
Whereof excess in wine had been the source;<BR>
As if what ill wine prompts to do or say,<BR>
Water, as well as wine, could wash away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Soon thitherward flocked many a cavalier;<BR>
Some who pursued the beaten road and plain;<BR>
Since for way-faring men, who southward steer,<BR>
No straighter lay for Italy or Spain:<BR>
Their courage and their honour, held more dear<BR>
Than life, excited others of the train;<BR>
And all, where they had hoped the meed of strife,<BR>
Had lost their arms, and many arms and life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
If those he conquers are of pagan strain,<BR>
He is content to take their arms and vest:<BR>
And of those first arrived the titles plain<BR>
Are written, and their arms suspended rest.<BR>
But he in prison pens the christened train,<BR>
(&#8217;Twould seem) to be to Argier&#8217;s realm addrest.<BR>
Not yet was brought that building to a head<BR>
When thitherward the crazed Orlando sped.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
It chanced Orlando, in his furious mood,<BR>
Came thither where that foaming river ran;<BR>
Where Rodomont beside the mighty flood<BR>
Was hurrying on his work; nor yet were done<BR>
The tower and tomb, the bridge, scarce finished, stood:<BR>
Here&#8212;save his casque was open&#8212;Ulien&#8217;s son<BR>
Steeled cap-a-pee, stood ready armed for fight,<BR>
When to the bridge approached Anglantes&#8217; knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
Orlando running thus his wild career,<BR>
The barrier tops, and o&#8217;er the bridge would fly,<BR>
But sullen Rodomont, with troubled cheer,<BR>
Afoot, as he that tower is standing nigh,<BR>
For he disdains to brandish sword or spear,<BR>
Shouts to him from afar with threatening cry,<BR>
&#8220;Halt! thou intrusive churl and indiscreet,<BR>
Rash, meddling, saucy villain, stay thy feet!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Only for lord and cavalier was made,<BR>
And not for thee, dull slave, that bridge was meant.&#8221;<BR>
To this no heed insane Orlando paid,<BR>
But, fixt upon his purpose, forward went.<BR>
&#8220;This madman must I school,&#8221; the paynim said,<BR>
And was approaching with the fell intent<BR>
Him into that deep river to dispatch,<BR>
Nor deeming in such foe to find his match.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
This while, a gentle damsel sought the place<BR>
That towards that bridge across the river rode,<BR>
Richly arraid and beautiful of face,<BR>
Who sage reserve in her demeanor showed.<BR>
&#8217;Tis she that, of her Brandimart in chase,<BR>
(If you remember, sir,) through every road<BR>
And place her lover seeks in anxious wise,<BR>
Excepting Paris, where the warrior lies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
When Flordelice that bridge and tower was near,<BR>
(So was by name the wandering damsel hight)<BR>
Grappling with Roland stood the Sarzan peer,<BR>
And would into that river pitch the knight.<BR>
She, conversant with Brava&#8217;s cavalier,<BR>
The miserable county knew aright;<BR>
And mighty marvel in that dame it raised<BR>
To see him rove, a naked man and crazed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
She stopt, the issue of that strife to know,<BR>
Wherein those two so puissant warriors vied.<BR>
His opposite by might and main to throw,<BR>
Into the stream each doughty champion tried.<BR>
&#8220;How can a fool such mighty prowess show?&#8221;<BR>
Between his teeth, the furious paynim cried.<BR>
And, shifting here and there, was seen to strain,<BR>
Brimfull of pride, and anger, and disdain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
This hand and now that other he puts out,<BR>
To take new hold, where he his vantage spies;<BR>
Now within Roland&#8217;s legs, and now without,<BR>
Locks his right foot or left, in skilful wise;<BR>
And thus resembles, in that wrestling bout,<BR>
The stupid bear, who in his fury tries<BR>
The tree, from whence he tumbled, to o&#8217;erthrow;<BR>
Deeming it sole occasion of his woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
Roland, whose better wit was lost withal,<BR>
I know no where, and who used force alone;<BR>
That utmost force, to which this earthly ball<BR>
Haply affords few paragons, or none,<BR>
Let himself backwards in that struggle fall,<BR>
Embracing as he stood with Ulien&#8217;s son.<BR>
Together in the foaming stream they sank;<BR>
High flashed the wave, and groaned the echoing bank.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Quickly the stream asunder bore the pair.<BR>
Roland was naked, and like fish could swim,<BR>
Here shot his feet, his arms extended there,<BR>
And gained the bank; nor, when upon the brim,<BR>
Halted to mark if his adventure were<BR>
Achieved with praise or shame: in evil trim,<BR>
The pagan, by his arms impeded sore,<BR>
With heavier pain and trouble, toiled ashore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Along the bridge which spanned that foaming tide<BR>
Did Flordelice meantime securely pace,<BR>
And, having vainly sought on every side<BR>
Brandimart&#8217;s bearing, since nor iron case<BR>
Nor vest of his she anywhere espied,<BR>
She hoped to find the knight in other place.<BR>
But here return we of the count to tell,<BR>
Who left behind him stream, bridge tower, and cell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twere phrensy of his every frantic feat<BR>
To promise the relation, one by one;<BR>
So many and many,&#8212;should I these repeat,<BR>
I know not when my story would be done.<BR>
Yet some of his notorious deeds, and meet<BR>
For mention in my song, will I make known:<BR>
Nor will I not that wondrous one recount,<BR>
Near Thoulouse, on the Pyrenaean Mount.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Much country had been traversed by the knight,<BR>
Urged by the furious rage which him misguides:<BR>
At last he reached the hill whose boundary height<BR>
Arragonese and neighbouring Frank divides.<BR>
Thither directing aye his course outright,<BR>
Where the descending sun his visage hides,<BR>
He reached a path upon the rugged steep,<BR>
Which overhung a valley dark and deep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Here he by chance encountered in mid road<BR>
Two youths, that wood men were, and drove before<BR>
An ass along that pathway, with a load<BR>
Of logs; they, marking well what scanty store<BR>
Of brain in poor Orlando&#8217;s head was stowed,<BR>
Called to the approaching knight, and threatened sore;<BR>
Bidding him stand aside, or else go back,<BR>
Nor to their hindrance block the common track.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
To this address Orlando answered nought,<BR>
Save that his foot he to their beast applied,<BR>
Smote in mid-breast, which, with that vigour fraught,<BR>
&#8212;That force exceeding every force beside&#8212;<BR>
Tost him so hight, that the beholders thought<BR>
It was a bird in air which they descried.<BR>
The ass upon a mountain-summit fell,<BR>
Which rose above a mile beyond that dell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Upon those youths next sprang the furious knight.<BR>
With better luck than wit, one woodman shear<BR>
From that tall cliff, twice thirty yards in height,<BR>
Cast himself headlong downward in his fear:<BR>
Him a moist patch of brambles, in his flight,<BR>
Received; and, amid grass and bushes, here,<BR>
From other mischief safe, the stripling lit,<BR>
And for some scratches in his face was quit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
That other to a jutting fragment clung,<BR>
Who so to gain the higher steep would strive;<BR>
Because he hopes, if once those crags among,<BR>
To keep him from that fool he may contrive;<BR>
But by the feet Orlando, ere he sprung,<BR>
Seized him, who will not leave the wretch alive;<BR>
And stretching them as wide as he could strain,<BR>
So stretched his arms, he rent his prey in twain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Even in such mode as often we descry<BR>
Falconer by heron or by puller do;<BR>
Whose entrails he plucks out, to satisfy<BR>
Merlin or falcon that the game pursue.<BR>
How happy was that other not to die!<BR>
Who risqued his neck in that deep bottom, who<BR>
Rehearsed the tale so often, Turpin heard,<BR>
And handed down to us the wondrous word.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
These and more marvels does the count, who bends<BR>
His steps across that mountain to the plain;<BR>
And, seeking long a path, at length descends<BR>
Towards the south, upon the land of Spain.<BR>
His way along the beach he after wends,<BR>
Near Arragon, beside the rumbling main,<BR>
And, ever prompted by his phrensy rank,<BR>
Will make himself a dwelling on the bank,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Where he somedeal may shun the noontide ray,<BR>
With dry and powdery sea-sand covered o&#8217;er;<BR>
And here, while so employed, upon their way<BR>
Arrives Angelica with her Medore,<BR>
Who, as you have been told in former lay,<BR>
Had from the hills descended on that shore.<BR>
Within a yard or less approached the fair,<BR>
Ere yet she of his presence was aware.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
So different from himself was he to sight,<BR>
Nought of Orlando she in him surveyed:<BR>
For, from the time that rage possest his sprite,<BR>
He had gone naked forth in sun and shade.<BR>
Had he been born on hot Syene&#8217;s site,<BR>
Or sands where worship is to Ammon paid,<BR>
Or nigh those hills, whence Nile&#8217;s full waters spin,<BR>
Orlando had not borne a dingier skin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
Nigh buried in their sockets are his eyes,<BR>
Spare in his visage, and as dry as bone:<BR>
Dishevelled is his hair in woeful wise,<BR>
With frightful beard his cheek is overgrown:<BR>
No sooner is he seen, than backward flies<BR>
Angelica, who, trembling sore, is flown:<BR>
She shrieking loud, all trembling and dismaid,<BR>
Betakes her to her youthful guide for aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
When crazed Orlando was of her aware,<BR>
To seize the damsel he upsprang in haste;<BR>
So pleased the wretched count her visage fair,<BR>
So quickly was his mood inflamed: effaced<BR>
In him all ancient recollections are,<BR>
How she by him was whilom served and graced.<BR>
Behind her speech the count and hunts that dame,<BR>
As questing dog pursues the sylvan game.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
The youth, that sees him chase his love who fled,<BR>
His courser spurs, and in pursuit is gone.<BR>
With naked faulchion after him he sped,<BR>
And cut and thrust at Roland as he run.<BR>
He from his shoulders hoped to cleave his head,<BR>
But found the madman&#8217;s skin as hard as bone;<BR>
Yea, harder far than steel, nor to be harmed;<BR>
So good Orlando at his birth was charmed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
When on his back Orlando felt him beat,<BR>
He turned, and turning on his youthful foe,<BR>
Smote with clenched fist, and force which nought can meet,<BR>
&#8212;Smote on his horse&#8217;s head, a fearful blow;<BR>
And, with skull smashed like glass, that courser fleet<BR>
Was by the madman&#8217;s furious stroke laid low.<BR>
In the same breath Orlando turned anew,<BR>
And chased the damsel that before him flew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
At speed Angelica impelled her mare.<BR>
And whipt and spurred her evermore; whom slow<BR>
She would esteem, albeit that palfrey were<BR>
Yet faster than a shaft dismist from bow:<BR>
Her ring she thought upon, and this the fair<BR>
Placed in her mouth; nor failed its virtue now;<BR>
For putting it between her lips, like light<BR>
Extinguished by a puff, she past from sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Was it through fear, or was she, while she stript<BR>
This from her finger, shaken in her seat;<BR>
Or was it rather, that her palfrey tript,<BR>
(For neither this nor that I surely weet)<BR>
Angelica, while &#8217;twixt her lips she slipt<BR>
The virtuous ring, and hid her visage sweet,<BR>
Her stirrups lost; and, tumbling form the sell,<BR>
Reversed upon the sand that lady fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
If but two inches short had fallen his prey,<BR>
Upon her would have pounced Orlando near;<BR>
Who would have crushed her in his furious way,<BR>
But that kind Fortune saved her from the peer.<BR>
Let her by other theft herself purvey<BR>
With other palfrey, as she did whilere;<BR>
For never will she have this courser more,<BR>
Who chased by swift Orlando scours the shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Doubt not that she another will provide;<BR>
And follow we in mad Orlando&#8217;s rear;<BR>
Whose rage and fury nevermore subside,<BR>
Wroth that Angelica should disappear:<BR>
After that beast along the sands he hied,<BR>
Aye gaining on the mare in this career.<BR>
Now, now he touches her, and lo! The mane<BR>
He grasps, and now secures her by the rein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Orlando seizes her with that delight<BR>
That other man might seize a damsel fair;<BR>
The bit and bridle he adjusts aright,<BR>
Springs on her back, and o&#8217;er the sea-beach bare<BR>
For many miles impels the palfrey&#8217;s flight,<BR>
Without repose or pause, now here, now there:<BR>
Nor ever sell or bridle be displaced,<BR>
Nor let her grass or heartening forage taste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
As in this course to o&#8217;erleap a ditch he sought,<BR>
Head over heels, she with her rider went:<BR>
Nor harmed was he, nor felt that tumble aright;<BR>
But she, with shoulder slipt, lay foully shent.<BR>
Long how to bear her thence Orlando thought,<BR>
And in the end upon his shoulders hent.<BR>
He from the bottom climbed, thus loaded sore,<BR>
And carried her three bow-shots&#8217; length and more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Next, for he felt that weight too irksome grow,<BR>
He put her down, to lead her by the rein;<BR>
Who followed him with limping gait and slow,<BR>
&#8220;Come on,&#8221; Orlando cried, and cried in vain;<BR>
And, could the palfrey at a gallop go,<BR>
This ill would satisfy his mood insane.<BR>
The halter from her head he last unloosed,<BR>
Wherewith her hind off-foot the madman noosed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis thus he comforts and drags on that mare,<BR>
That she may follow with more ease, so led;<BR>
Who whiles despoiled of flesh, and whiles of hair,<BR>
Is scathed by stones which that ill road o&#8217;erspread.<BR>
At length the misused beast, with wear and tear<BR>
Of the rude rocks, and suffering sore, lies dead.<BR>
Orlando nought the slaughtered mare regards,<BR>
Nor anywise his headlong course retards.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
To drag that palfrey ceased he not, though dead,<BR>
Continuing still his course towards the west,<BR>
And all this while sacked hamlet, farm, and stead,<BR>
Whenever he by hunger was distrest;<BR>
And aye to glut himself with meat, and bread,<BR>
And fruit, he every one by force opprest.<BR>
One by his hand was slain, one foully shent;<BR>
Seldom he stopt, and ever onward went.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
As much, or little less, would do the knight<BR>
By his own love, did not that damsel hide;<BR>
Because the wretch discerns not black from white,<BR>
And harms where he would help. A curse betide<BR>
The wonder-working ring, and eke the wight<BR>
Who gave it to that lady, full or pride!<BR>
Since Roland, but for this, would venge the scorn<BR>
He and a thousand more from her had borne.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Would that of her Orlando were possest,<BR>
And of all women that are above ground!<BR>
For one and all are ingrates at the best,<BR>
Nor is in all an ounce of goodness found.<BR>
But it is meet I let my hearer rest<BR>
Ere my strained chords return a faltering sound,<BR>
And that he may less tedious deem the rhyme,<BR>
Defer my story till another time.</TD></TR>
