<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Lurcanio, by a false report abused,<BR>
Deemed by Geneura&#8217;s fault his brother dead,<BR>
Weening the faithless duke, whom she refused,<BR>
Was taken by the damsel to her bed;<BR>
And her before the king and peers accused:<BR>
But to the session Ariodantes led,<BR>
Strives with his brother in disguise. In season<BR>
Rinaldo comes to venge the secret treason.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
A<SMALL>MONG</SMALL> all other animals who prey<BR>
On earth, or who unite in friendly wise,<BR>
Whether they mix in peace or moody fray,<BR>
No male offends his mate. In safety hies<BR>
The she bear, matched with hers, through forest gray:<BR>
The lioness beside the lion lies:<BR>
Wolves, male and female, live in loving cheer;<BR>
Nor gentle heifer dreads the wilful steer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
What Fury, what abominable Pest<BR>
Such poison in the human heart has shed,<BR>
That still &#8217;twixt man and wife, with rage possessed,<BR>
Injurious words and foul reproach are said?<BR>
And blows and outrage base their peace molest,<BR>
And bitter tears still wash the genial bed;<BR>
Not only watered by the tearful flood,<BR>
But often bathed by senseless ire with blood?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Not simply a rank sinner, he appears<BR>
To outrage nature, and his God to dare,<BR>
Who his foul hand against a woman rears,<BR>
Or of her head would harm a single hair.<BR>
But who what drug the burning entrail sears,<BR>
Or who for her would knife or noose prepare,<BR>
No man appears to me, though such to sight<BR>
He seem, but rather some infernal sprite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Such, and no other were those ruffians two,<BR>
Whom good Rinaldo from the damsel scared,<BR>
Conducted to these valleys out of view,<BR>
That none might wot of her so foully snared.<BR>
I ended where the damsel, fair of hue,<BR>
To tell the occasion of her scathe prepared,<BR>
To the good Paladin, who brought release;<BR>
And in conclusion thus my story piece.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of direr deed than ever yet was done,&#8221;<BR>
The gentle dame began, &#8220;Sir cavalier,<BR>
In Thebes, Mycene, Argos, or upon<BR>
Other more savage soil, prepare to hear;<BR>
And I believe, that if the circling sun<BR>
To these our Scottish shores approach less near<BR>
Than other land, &#8217;tis that he would eschew<BR>
A foul ferocious race that shocks his view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;All times have shown that man has still pursued<BR>
With hair, in every clime, his natural foe;<BR>
But to deal death to those who seek our good<BR>
Does from too ill and foul a nature flow.<BR>
Now, that the truth be better understood,<BR>
I shall from first to last the occasion show,<BR>
Why in my tender years, against all right,<BR>
Those caitiffs would have done me foul despite.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis fitting you should know, that in the spring<BR>
Of life, I to the palace made resort;<BR>
There served long time the daughter of the king,<BR>
And grew with her in growth, well placed in court.<BR>
When cruel love, my fortune envying,<BR>
Willed I should be his follower and his sport;<BR>
And made, beyond each Scottish lord and knight,<BR>
Albany&#8217;s duke find favour in my sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And for he seemed to cherish me above<BR>
All mean; his love a love as ardent bred.<BR>
We hear, indeed, and see, but do not prove<BR>
Man&#8217;s faith, nor is his bosom&#8217;s purpose read.<BR>
Believing still, and yielding to my love,<BR>
I ceased not till I took him to my bed;<BR>
Nor, of all chambers, in that evil hour,<BR>
Marked I was in Geneura&#8217;s priviest bower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Where, hoarded, she with careful privacy<BR>
Preserved whatever she esteemed most rare;<BR>
There many times she slept. A gallery<BR>
From thence projected into the open air.<BR>
Here oft I made my lover climb to me,<BR>
And (what he was to mount) a hempen stair,<BR>
When him I to my longing arms would call,<BR>
From the projecting balcony let fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For here my passion I as often fed<BR>
As good Geneura&#8217;s absence made me bold;<BR>
Who with the varying season changed her bed,<BR>
To shun the burning heat or pinching cold,<BR>
And Albany, unseen and safely sped;<BR>
For, fronting a dismantled street, and old,<BR>
Was built that portion of the palace bright;<BR>
Nor any went that way by day or night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So was for many days and months maintained<BR>
By us, in secrecy, the amorous game;<BR>
Still grew by love, and such new vigour gained,<BR>
I in my inmost bosom felt the flame;<BR>
And that he little loved, and deeply feigned<BR>
Weened not, so was I blinded to my shame:<BR>
Though, in a thousand certain signs betrayed,<BR>
The faithless knight his base deceit bewrayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;After some days, of fair Geneura he<BR>
A suitor showed himself; I cannot say<BR>
If this began before he sighed for me,<BR>
Or, after, of this love he made assay:<BR>
But judge, alas! with what supremacy<BR>
He ruled my heart, how absolute his sway!<BR>
Since this he owned, and thought no shame to move<BR>
Me to assist him in his second love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Unlike what he bore me, he said, indeed,<BR>
That was not true which he for her displayed:<BR>
But so pretending love, he hoped to speed,<BR>
And celebrate due spousals with the maid.<BR>
He with her royal sire might well succeed,<BR>
Were she consenting to the boon he prayed;<BR>
For after our good king, for wealth and birth<BR>
In all the realm, was none of equal worth.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Me he persuades, if through my ministry<BR>
He the king&#8217;s son-in-law elected were,<BR>
For I must know he next the king would be<BR>
Advanced as high, as subject could repair,<BR>
The merit should be mine, and ever he<BR>
So great a benefit in mind would bear;<BR>
And he would cherish me above his bride,<BR>
And more than every other dame beside.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I, who to please him was entirely bent,<BR>
Who never could or would gainsay his will,<BR>
Upon those days alone enjoy content,<BR>
When I find means his wishes to fulfil:<BR>
And snatch at all occasions which present<BR>
A mode, his praise and merits to instil:<BR>
And for my lover with all labour strain,<BR>
And industry, Geneura&#8217;s love to gain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With all my heart, in furtherance of his suit,<BR>
I wrought what could be done, God truly knows;<BR>
But with Geneura this produced no fruit,<BR>
Nor her to grace my duke could I dispose.<BR>
For that another love had taken root<BR>
In her, whose every fond affection flows<BR>
Towards a gentle knight of courteous lore,<BR>
Who sought our Scotland from a distant shore:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And with a brother, then right young, to stay<BR>
In our king&#8217;s court, came out of Italy;<BR>
And there of knightly arms made such assay,<BR>
Was none in Britain more approved than he;<BR>
Prized by the king, who (no ignoble pay),<BR>
Rewarding him like his nobility,<BR>
Bestowed upon the youth, with liberal hand,<BR>
Burghs, baronies, and castles, woods and land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Dear to the monarch, to the daughter still<BR>
This lord was dearer, Ariodantes hight.<BR>
Her with affection might his valour fill;<BR>
But knowledge of his love brought more delight.<BR>
Nor old Vesuvius, nor Sicilia&#8217;s hill,<BR>
Nor Troy-town, ever, with a blaze so bright,<BR>
Flamed, as with all his heart, the damsel learned,<BR>
For love of her young Ariodantes burned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The passion which she bore the lord, preferred<BR>
And loved with perfect truth and all her heart,<BR>
Was the occassion I was still unheard;<BR>
Nor hopeful answer would she e&#8217;er impart: <BR>
And still the more my lover&#8217;s suit I stirred,<BR>
And to obtain his guerdon strove with art,<BR>
Him she would censure still, and ever more<BR>
Was strengthened in the hate she nursed before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My wayward lover often I excite<BR>
So vain and bootless an emprize to quit;<BR>
Nor idly hope to turn her stedfast sprite,<BR>
Too deeply with another passion smit;<BR>
And make apparent to the Scottish knight,<BR>
Ariodantes such a flame had lit<BR>
In the young damsel&#8217;s breast, that seas in flood<BR>
Would not have cooled one whit her boiling blood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This Polinesso many times had heard<BR>
From me (for such the Scottish baron&#8217;s name)<BR>
Well warranted by sight as well as word,<BR>
How ill his love was cherished by the dame.<BR>
To see another to himself preferred<BR>
Not only quenched the haughty warrior&#8217;s flame,<BR>
But the fond love, which in his bosom burned<BR>
Into despiteful rage and hatred turned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Between Geneura and her faithful knight<BR>
Such discord and ill will he schemed to shed,<BR>
And put betwixt the pair such foul despite.<BR>
No time should heal the quarrel he had bred;<BR>
Bringing such scandal on that damsel bright,<BR>
The stain should cleave to her, alive or dead:<BR>
Nor, bent to wreck her on this fatal shelf,<BR>
Counselled with me, or other but himself.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Dalinda mine,&#8217; he said, his project brewed,<BR>
(Dalinda is my name) &#8216;you needs must know,<BR>
That from the root although the trunk be hewed,<BR>
Successive suckers many times will grow.<BR>
Thus my unhappy passion is renewed,<BR>
Tenacious still of life, and buds; although<BR>
Cut off by ill success, with new increase:<BR>
Nor, till I compass my desire, will cease.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Nor hope of pleasure this so much has wrought,<BR>
As that to compass my design would please;<BR>
And, if not in effect, at least in thought<BR>
To thrive, would interpose some little ease.<BR>
Then every time your bower by me is sought,<BR>
When in her bed Geneura slumbers, seize<BR>
What she puts off, and be it still your care<BR>
To dress yourself in all her daily wear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Dispose your locks and deck yourself as she<BR>
Goes decked; and, as you can, with cunning heed,<BR>
Imitate her; then to the gallery<BR>
You, furnished with the corded stair, shall speed:<BR>
I shall ascend it in the phantasy<BR>
That you are she, of whom you wear the weed:<BR>
And hope, that putting on myself this cheat,<BR>
I in short time shall quench my amorous heat.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So said the knight; and I, who was distraught,<BR>
And all beside myself, was not aware<BR>
That the design, in which he help besought,<BR>
Was manifestly but too foul a snare;<BR>
And in Geneura&#8217;s clothes disguised, as taught,<BR>
Let down (so oft I used) the corded stair.<BR>
Nor I the traitor&#8217;s foul deceit perceived,<BR>
Until the deadly mischief was achieved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The duke, this while, to Ariodantes&#8217; ears<BR>
Had these, or other words like these, addressed;<BR>
(For leagued in friendship were the cavaliers,<BR>
Till, rivals, they pursued this common quest)<BR>
&#8216;I marvel, since you are of all my peers<BR>
He, whom I must have honoured and caressed,<BR>
And held in high regard, and cherished still,<BR>
You should my benefits repay so ill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I am assured you comprehend and know<BR>
Mine and Geneura&#8217;s love, and old accord;<BR>
And, in legitimate espousal, how<BR>
I am about to claim her from my lord:<BR>
Then why disturb my suit, and why bestow<BR>
Your heart on her who offers no reward?<BR>
By Heaven, I should respect your claim and place,<BR>
Were your condition mine, and mine your case.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And I,&#8217; cried Ariodantes, &#8216;marvel more&#8217;<BR>
(In answer to the Scottish lord) &#8216;at you,<BR>
Since I of her enamoured was, before<BR>
That gentle damsel ever met your view;<BR>
And know, you are assured how evermore<BR>
We two have loved;&#8212;was never love more true&#8212;<BR>
Are certain she alone would share my lot;<BR>
And are as well assured she loves you not.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Why have not I from you the same respect,<BR>
To which, for friendship past, you would pretend<BR>
From me; and I should bear you in effect,<BR>
If your hope stood more fair to gain its end?<BR>
No less than you, to wed her I expect;<BR>
And if your fortunes here my wealth transcend,<BR>
As favoured of the king, as you, above<BR>
You, am I happy in his daughter&#8217;s love.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Of what a strange mistake,&#8217; (to him replied<BR>
The duke) &#8216;your foolish passion is the root!<BR>
You think yourself beloved; I, on my side,<BR>
Believe the same; this try we by the fruit.<BR>
You of your own proceeding nothing hide,<BR>
And I will tell the secrets of my suit:<BR>
And let the man who proves least favoured, yield,<BR>
Provide himself elsewhere, and quit the field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I am prepared, if such your wish, to swear<BR>
Nothing of what is told me to reveal;<BR>
And will that you assure me, for your share,<BR>
You shall what I recount as well conceal.&#8217;<BR>
Uniting in the pact, the rival pair<BR>
Their solemn vows upon the Bible seal:<BR>
And when they had the mutual promise plighted,<BR>
Ariodantes first his tale recited.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then plainly, and by simple facts averred,<BR>
How with Geneura stood his suit, avows;<BR>
And how, engaged by writing and by word,<BR>
She swore she would not be another&#8217;s spouse.<BR>
How, if to him the Scottish king demurred,<BR>
Virgin austerity she ever vows;<BR>
And other bridal bond for aye eschewed,<BR>
To pass her days in barren solitude.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then added, how he hoped by worth, which he<BR>
Had more than once avouched, with knightly brand,<BR>
And yet might vouch, to the prosperity<BR>
And honour of the king, and of his land,<BR>
To please so well that monarch, as to be<BR>
By him accounted worthy of the hand<BR>
Of his fair child, espoused with his consent:<BR>
Since he in this her wishes would content.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then so concludes&#8212;&#8216;I stand upon this ground,<BR>
Nor I intruder fear, encroaching nigh;<BR>
Nor seek I more; &#8217;tis here my hopes I bound;<BR>
Nor, striving for Geneura&#8217;s love, would I<BR>
Seek surer sign of it than what is found,<BR>
By God allowed, in wedlock&#8217;s lawful tie;<BR>
And other suit were hopeless, am I sure,<BR>
So excellent she is, and passing pure.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When Ariodantes had, with honest mind,<BR>
Told what reward he hoped should quit his pain,<BR>
False Polinesso, who before designed<BR>
To make Geneura hateful to her swain,<BR>
Began&#8212;&#8216;Alas! you yet are far behind<BR>
My hopes, and shall confess your own are vain<BR>
And say, as I the root shall manifest<BR>
Of my good fortune, I alone am blest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;With you Geneura feigns, nor pays nor prizes<BR>
Your passion, which with hopes and words is fed;<BR>
And, more than this, your foolish love despises:<BR>
And this to me the damsel oft has said,<BR>
Of hers I am assured; of no surmises,<BR>
Vain, worthless words, or idle promise bred.<BR>
And I to you the fact in trust reveal,<BR>
Though this I should in better faith conceal.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;There passes not a month, but in that space<BR>
Three nights, four, six, and often ten, the fair<BR>
Receives me with that joy in her embrace,<BR>
Which seems to second so the warmth we share.<BR>
This you may witness, and shall judge the case;<BR>
If empty hopes can with my bliss compare.<BR>
Then since my happier fortune is above<BR>
Your wishes, yield, and seek another love.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;This will I not believe,&#8217; in answer cried<BR>
Ariodantes, &#8216;well assured you lie,<BR>
And that you have this string of falsehoods tied,<BR>
To scare me from the dear emprize I try.<BR>
But charge, so passing foul, you shall abide,<BR>
And vouch what you have said in arms; for I<BR>
Not only on your tale place no reliance;<BR>
But as a traitor hurl you my defiance.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To him rejoined the duke, &#8216;I ween &#8217;twere ill<BR>
To take the battle upon either part,<BR>
Since surer mean our purpose may fulfill;<BR>
And if it please, my proof I can impart.&#8217;<BR>
Ariodantes trembled, and a chill<BR>
Went through his inmost bones; and sick at heart,<BR>
Had he in full believed his rival&#8217;s boast,<BR>
Would on the spot have yielded up the ghost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With wounded heart, and faltering voice, pale face,<BR>
And mouth of gall, he answered, &#8216;When I see<BR>
Proofs of thy rare adventure, and the grace<BR>
With which the fair Geneura honours thee,<BR>
I promise to forego the fruitless chase<BR>
Of one, to thee so kind, so cold to me.<BR>
But think not that thy story shall avail,<BR>
Unless my very eyes confirm the tale.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;To warn in due time shall be my care.&#8217;<BR>
(Said Polinesso) and so went his way.<BR>
Two nights were scarcely passed, ere his repair<BR>
To the known bower was fixed for the assay.<BR>
And, ready now to spring his secret snare,<BR>
He sought his rival on the appointed day,<BR>
And him to hide, the night ensuing, prayed<BR>
I&#8217; the street, which none their habitation made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And to the youth a station over-right<BR>
The balcony, to which he clambered, shows.<BR>
Ariodantes weened, this while, the knight<BR>
Would him to seek that hidden place dispose,<BR>
As one well suited to his fell despite,<BR>
And, bent to take his life, this ambush chose,<BR>
Under the false pretence to make him see<BR>
What seemed a sheer impossibility.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To go the peer resolved, but in such guise,<BR>
He should not be with vantage overlaid;<BR>
And should he be assaulted by surprise,<BR>
He need not be by fear of death dismay&#8217;d.<BR>
He had a noble brother, bold and wise,<BR>
First of the court in arms; and on his aid,<BR>
Lurcanio hight, relied with better heart<BR>
Than if ten others fought upon his part.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He called him to his side, and willed him take<BR>
His arms; and to the place at evening led:<BR>
Yet not his secret purpose would be break;<BR>
Nor this to him, or other would have read:<BR>
Him a stone&#8217;s throw removed he placed, and spake:<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;Come if thou hearest me cry,&#8217; the warrior said;<BR>
&#8216;But as thou lovest me (whatsoe&#8217;er befall)<BR>
Come not and move not, brother, till I call.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Doubt not&#8217; (the valiant brother said) &#8216;but go;&#8217;<BR>
And thither went that baron silently,<BR>
And hid within the lonely house, and low,<BR>
Over against my secret gallery.<BR>
On the other side approached the fraudful foe,<BR>
So pleased to work Geneura&#8217;s infamy;<BR>
And, while I nothing of the cheat divine,<BR>
Beneath my bower renews the wonted sign.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And I in costly robe, in which were set<BR>
Fair stripes of gold upon a snowy ground,<BR>
My tresses gathered in a golden net,<BR>
Shaded with tassels of vermillion round,<BR>
Mimicking fashions, which were only met<BR>
In fair Geneura, at the accustomed sound,<BR>
The gallery mount, constructed in such mode,<BR>
As upon every side my person showed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This while Lurcanio, either with a view<BR>
To snares which might beset his brother&#8217;s feet,<BR>
Or with the common passion to pursue,<BR>
And play the spy on other, where the street<BR>
Was darkest, and its deepest shadows threw,<BR>
Followed him softly to his dim retreat:<BR>
And not ten paces from the knight aloof,<BR>
Bestowed himself beneath the self same roof.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Suspecting nought, I seek the balcony,<BR>
In the same habits which I mentioned, dressed;<BR>
As more than once or twice (still happily)<BR>
I did before; meanwhile the goodly vest<BR>
Was in the moonlight clearly seen, and I,<BR>
In aspect not unlike her, in the rest<BR>
Resembling much Geneura&#8217;s shape and cheer,<BR>
One visage well another might appear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So much the more, that there was ample space<BR>
Between the palace and the ruined row:<BR>
Hence the two brothers, posted in that place,<BR>
Were lightly cheated by the lying show.<BR>
Now put yourself in his unhappy case,<BR>
And figure what the wretched lover&#8217;s woe,<BR>
When Polinesso climbed the stair, which I<BR>
Cast down to him, and scaled the gallery.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Arrived, my arms about his neck I throw,<BR>
Weening that we unseen of others meet,<BR>
And kiss his lips and face with loving show,<BR>
As him I hitherto was wont to greet;<BR>
And he assayed, with more than wonted glow,<BR>
Me to caress, to mask his hollow cheat.<BR>
Led to the shameful spectacle, aghast,<BR>
That other, from afar, viewed all that passed,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And fell into such fit of deep despair,<BR>
He there resolved to die; and, to that end,<BR>
Planted the pommel of his falchion bare<BR>
I&#8217; the ground, its point against his breast to bend.<BR>
Lurcanio, who with marvel by that stair,<BR>
Saw Polinesso to my bower ascend,<BR>
But knew not who the wight, with ready speed<BR>
Sprang forward, when he saw his brother&#8217;s deed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And hindered him in that fell agony<BR>
From turning his own hand against his breast.<BR>
Had the good youth been later, or less nigh,<BR>
To his assistance he had vainly pressed.<BR>
Then, &#8216;Wretched brother, what insanity,&#8217;<BR>
(He cried) &#8216;your better sense has dispossessed?<BR>
Die for a woman! rather let her kind<BR>
Be scattered like the mist before the wind!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Compass her death! &#8217;tis well deserved; your own<BR>
Reserve, as due to more illustrious fate.<BR>
&#8217;Twas well to love, before her fraud was shown,<BR>
But she, once loved, now more deserves your hate:<BR>
Since, witnessed by your eyes, to you is known<BR>
A wanton of what sort you worshipped late.<BR>
Her fault before the Scottish king to attest,<BR>
Reserve those arms you turn against your breast.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ariodantes, so surprised, forewent,<BR>
Joined by his brother, the design in show;<BR>
But resolute to die, in his intent<BR>
Was little shaken: Rising thence to go,<BR>
He bears away a heart not simply rent,<BR>
But dead and withered with excess of woe:<BR>
Yet better comfort to Lurcanio feigns,<BR>
As if the rage were spent which fired his veins.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The morn ensuing, without further say<BR>
To his good brother, or to man beside,<BR>
He from the city took his reckless way<BR>
With deadly desperation for his guide;<BR>
Nor, save the duke and knight, for many a day<BR>
Was there who knew what moved the youth to ride:<BR>
And in the palace, touching this event,<BR>
And in the realm, was various sentiment.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But eight days past or more, to Scotland&#8217;s court<BR>
A traveller came, and to Geneura he<BR>
Related tidings of disastrous sort;<BR>
That Ariodantes perished in the sea:<BR>
Drowned of his own free will was the report,<BR>
No wind to blame for the calamity!<BR>
Since from a rock, which over ocean hung,<BR>
Into the raging waves he headlong sprung;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Who said, before he reached that frowning crest,<BR>
To me, whom he encountered by the way,<BR>
&#8216;Come with me, that your tongue may manifest,<BR>
And what betides me to Geneura say;<BR>
And tell her, too, the occasion of the rest,<BR>
Which you shall witness without more delay;<BR>
In having seen too much, the occasion lies;<BR>
Happy had I been born without these eyes!&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By chance, upon a promontory we<BR>
Were standing, overright the Irish shore;<BR>
When, speaking thus on that high headland, he<BR>
Plunged from a rock amid the watery roar.<BR>
I saw him leap, and left him in the sea;<BR>
And, hurrying thence, to you the tidings bore.<BR>
Geneura stood amazed, her colour fled,<BR>
And, at the fearful tale, remained half dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O God! what said, what did she, when alone,<BR>
She on her faithful pillow layed her head!<BR>
She beat her bosom, and she tore her gown,<BR>
And in despite her golden tresses shed<BR>
Repeating often, in bewildered tone,<BR>
The last sad words which Ariodantes said;&#8212;<BR>
That the sole source of such despair, and such<BR>
Disaster, was that he had seen too much.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Wide was the rumour scattered that the peer<BR>
Had slain himself for grief; nor was the cry<BR>
By courtly dame, or courtly cavalier,<BR>
Or by the monarch, heard with tearless eye.<BR>
But, above all the rest, his brother dear<BR>
Was whelmed with sorrow of so deep a dye,<BR>
That, bent to follow him, he well nigh turned<BR>
His hand against himself, like him he mourned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And many times repeating in his thought,<BR>
It was Geneura who his brother slew,<BR>
Who was to self-destruction moved by nought<BR>
But her ill deed, which he was doomed to view,<BR>
So on his mind the thirst of vengeance wrought,<BR>
And so his grief his season overthrew;<BR>
That he thought little, graced of each estate,<BR>
To encounter king and people&#8217;s common hate;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, when the throng was fullest in the hall,<BR>
Stood up before the Scottish king, and said,<BR>
&#8216;Of having marred my brother&#8217;s wits withal,<BR>
Sir king, and him to his destruction led,<BR>
Your daughter only can I guilty call:<BR>
For in his inmost soul such sorrow bred<BR>
The having seen her little chastity,<BR>
He loathed existence, and preferred to die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;He was her lover; and for his intent<BR>
Was honest, this I seek not, I, to veil;<BR>
And to deserve her by his valour meant<BR>
Of thee, if faithful service might avail;<BR>
But while he stood aloof, and dared but scent<BR>
The blossoms, he beheld another scale,<BR>
Scale the forbidden tree with happier boot,<BR>
And bear away from him the wished-for fruit.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then added, how into the gallery came<BR>
Geneura, and how dropped the corded stair;<BR>
And how into the chamber of the dame<BR>
Had climbed a leman of that lady fair;<BR>
Who, for disguise (he knew not hence his name),<BR>
Had changed his habits, and concealed his hair;<BR>
And, in conclusion, vowed that every word<BR>
So said, he would avouch with lance and sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You may divine how grieves the sire, distraught<BR>
With woe, when he the accusation hears:<BR>
As well that what he never could have thought,<BR>
He of his daughter learns with wondering ears,<BR>
As that he knows, if succour be not brought<BR>
By cavalier, that in her cause appears,<BR>
Who may upon Lurcanio prove the lie,<BR>
He cannot choose, but doom the maid to die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I do not think our Scottish law to you<BR>
Is yet unknown, which sentences to fire<BR>
The miserable dame, or damsel, who<BR>
Grants other than her wedded lord&#8217;s desire.<BR>
She dies, unless a champion, good and true,<BR>
Arm on her side before a month expire;<BR>
And her against the accuser base maintain<BR>
Unmeriting such death, and free from stain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The king has made proclaim by town and tower,<BR>
(For he believes her wronged, his child to free)<BR>
Her he shall have to wife, with ample dower,<BR>
Who saves the royal maid from infamy.<BR>
But each to the other looks, and to this hour<BR>
No champion yet, &#8217;tis said, appears: for he,<BR>
Lurcanio, is esteemed so fierce in fight,<BR>
It seems as he were feared of every knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And evil Fate has willed her brother dear,<BR>
Zerbino, is not here the foe to face;<BR>
Since many months has roved the cavalier,<BR>
Proving his matchless worth with spear and mace;<BR>
For if the valiant champion were more near,<BR>
(Such is his courage) or in any place,<BR>
Whither in time the news might be conveyed,<BR>
He would not fail to bear his sister aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The king, mean time, who would the quest pursue,<BR>
And by more certain proof than combat, try<BR>
If the accuser&#8217;s tale be false or true,<BR>
And she deserve, or merit not, to die,<BR>
Arrests some ladies of her retinue,<BR>
That, as he weens, the fact can verify.<BR>
Whence I foresaw, that if I taken were,<BR>
Too certain risque the duke and I must share.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That very night I from the palace flee,<BR>
And to the duke repair, escaped from court;<BR>
And, were I taken, make him plainly see<BR>
How much it either&#8217;s safety would import:<BR>
He praised, and bade me of good courage be,<BR>
And, for his comfort, prayed me to resort<BR>
To a strong castle which he held hard by;<BR>
And gave me two to bear me company.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With what full proofs, sir stranger, you have heard,<BR>
I of my love assured the Scottish peer;<BR>
And clearly can discern, if so preferred,<BR>
That lord was justly bound to hold me dear.<BR>
Mark, in conclusion, what was my reward;<BR>
The glorious meed of my great merit hear!<BR>
And say if woman can expect to earn,<BR>
However well she love, her love&#8217;s return.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For this perfidious, foul, ungrateful man,<BR>
At length suspicious of my faith and zeal,<BR>
And apprehending that his wily plan,<BR>
In course of time, I haply might reveal,<BR>
Feigned that meanwhile the monarch&#8217;s anger ran<BR>
Too high, he would withdraw me, and conceal<BR>
Within a fortress of his own, where I<BR>
(Such was his real end) was doomed to die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For secretly the duke enjoined the guide,<BR>
Who with me through the gloomy forest went,<BR>
The worthy guerdon of a faith so tried,<BR>
To slay me; and had compassed his intent,<BR>
But for your ready succour, when I cried.<BR>
Behold! what wages love&#8217;s poor slaves content.&#8221;<BR>
Thus to Rinaldo did Dalinda say,<BR>
As they together still pursued their way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Above all other fortune, to the knight<BR>
Was welcome to have found the gentle maid,<BR>
Who the whole story of Geneura bright,<BR>
And her unblemished innocence displayed;<BR>
And, if he hoped, although accused with right,<BR>
To furnish the afflicted damsel aid,<BR>
Persuaded of the calumny&#8217;s disproof,<BR>
He with more courage warred in her behoof.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
And for St. Andrew&#8217;s town, with eager speed,<BR>
Where was the king with all his family,<BR>
And where the single fight, in listed mead,<BR>
Upon his daughter&#8217;s quarrel, was to be,<BR>
The good Rinaldo pricked, nor spared his steed,<BR>
Until, within an easy distance, he<BR>
Now near the city, met a squire who brought<BR>
More recent tidings than the damsel taught:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
That thither had repaired a stranger knight,<BR>
To combat in Geneura&#8217;s quarrel bent,<BR>
With ensigns strange, not known of living wight,<BR>
Since ever close concealed the warrior went;<BR>
Not, since he had been there, had bared to sight<BR>
His visage, aye within his helmet pent:<BR>
And that the very squire who with him came,<BR>
Swore that he knew not what the stranger&#8217;s name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Not far they ride before the walls appear,<BR>
And now before the gate their coursers stand.<BR>
To advance the sad Dalinda was in fear,<BR>
Yet followed, trusting in Rinaldo&#8217;s brand.<BR>
The gate was shut, and to the porter near,<BR>
&#8216;What this implies&#8217; Rinaldo makes demand:<BR>
To him was said, the people, one and all,<BR>
Were trooped to see a fight without the wall:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Beyond the city, fought upon accord,<BR>
Between Lurcanio and a stranger knight;<BR>
Where, on a spacious meadow&#8217;s level sward,<BR>
The pair already had begun the fight.<BR>
The porter opened to Mount Alban&#8217;s lord,<BR>
And straight behind the peer the portal hight.<BR>
Rinaldo through the empty city rode,<BR>
But in a hostel first the dame bestowed:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
And wills that she (he will not long delay<BR>
To seek her there) till his return repose;<BR>
And quickly to the lists pursued his way,<BR>
Where the two made that fell exchange of blows,<BR>
And strove and struggled yet in bloody fray.<BR>
Lurcanio&#8217;s heart with vengeful hatred glows<BR>
Against Geneura; while that other knight<BR>
As well maintains the quarrel for her right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Six knights on foot within the palisade<BR>
Stand covered with the corslet&#8217;s iron case;<BR>
Beneath the Duke of Albany arrayed,<BR>
Borne on a puissant steed of noble race:<BR>
Who there, as lord high-constable obeyed,<BR>
Was keeper of the field and of the place,<BR>
And joyed Geneura&#8217;s peril to espy<BR>
With swelling bosom and exulting eye.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo pierces through the parted swarm,<BR>
(So wide is felt the good Bayardo&#8217;s sway,)<BR>
And he who hears the courser come in storm,<BR>
Halts not, in his desire to make him way:<BR>
Above is seen Rinaldo&#8217;s lofty form,<BR>
The flower of those who mix in martial fray.<BR>
He stops his horse before the monarch&#8217;s chair,<BR>
While all to hear the paladin repair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Dread sir,&#8221; to him the good Rinaldo said,<BR>
&#8220;Let not the pair this combat longer ply;<BR>
Since whichsoever of the two falls dead,<BR>
Know, that you let him perish wrongfully:<BR>
<I>This</I> thinks that he is right, and is misled,<BR>
Vouches the false, and knows not &#8217;tis a lie:<BR>
Since that which brought his brother to his end,<BR>
Moves him in causeless battle contend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;<I>That</I>, in pure gentleness, with little care<BR>
If what he here maintains be wrong or right,<BR>
Because he would preserve a maid so fair,<BR>
Perils his person in the furious fight.<BR>
To injured innocence I safety bear,<BR>
And to the evil man its opposite.<BR>
But first, for love of God, the battle stay;<BR>
Then list, sir king, to what I shall display.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
So moved the king the grave authority<BR>
Of one who seemed so worthy, by his cheer,<BR>
That he made sign the battle should not be<BR>
Further continued then with sword or spear:<BR>
To whom, together with his chivalry,<BR>
And barons of the realm and others near<BR>
Rinaldo all the treacherous plot displayed,<BR>
Which Polinesso for Geneura layed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Next that he there in arms would testify<BR>
The truth of what he vouched, the warrior cried.<BR>
False Polinesso, called, with troubled eye,<BR>
Stood forth, but daringly the tale denied.<BR>
To him the good Rinaldo in reply;<BR>
&#8220;By deeds be now the doubtful quarrel tried.&#8221;<BR>
The field was cleared, and, ready armed, the foes,<BR>
Without more let, in deadly duel close.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
How was the hope to king and people dear,<BR>
The proof might show Geneura innocent!<BR>
All trust that God will make the treason clear,<BR>
And show she was accused with foul intent:<BR>
For Polinesso, greedy and severe,<BR>
And proud was held, and false and fraudulent.<BR>
So that none there, of all assembled, deemed<BR>
It marvel, if the knight such fraud had schemed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
False Polinesso, with a mien distressed,<BR>
A pallid cheek, and heart which thickly beat,<BR>
At the third trumpet, laid his lance in rest;<BR>
As well Rinaldo spurred the knight to meet,<BR>
And levelled at his evil foeman&#8217;s breast,<BR>
Eager to finish at a single heat.<BR>
Nor counter to his wish was the event;<BR>
Since through the warrior half his weapon went.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Him, through his breast, impaled upon the spear,<BR>
More than six yards beyond his horse he bore.<BR>
With speed alighted Mount Albano&#8217;s peer,<BR>
And, ere he rose, unlaced the helm he wore:<BR>
But he for mercy prayed with humble cheer,<BR>
Unfit to strive in joust or warfare more:<BR>
And, before king and court, with faltering breath,<BR>
Confessed the fraud which brought him to his death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
He brings not his confession to a close,<BR>
And pangs of death the failing accents drown:<BR>
The prince, who ended saw his daughter&#8217;s woes,<BR>
Redeemed from death and scorn, her virtue shown,<BR>
With more delight and rapture overflows,<BR>
Than if he, having lost his kingly crown,<BR>
Then saw it first upon his head replaced;<BR>
So that he good Rinaldo singly graced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
And when, through his uplifted casque displaid,<BR>
Features, well known before, the king descried,<BR>
His thanks to God with lifted hands he paid,<BR>
That he had deigned such succour to provide.<BR>
That other cavalier, who bared his blade,<BR>
Unknown of all, upon Geneura&#8217;s side,<BR>
And thither came from far, his aid to impart,<BR>
Looked upon all that passed, and stood apart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
Him the good king entreated to declare<BR>
His name, or, at the least, his visage shew;<BR>
That he might grace him with such guerdon fair,<BR>
As to his good intent was justly due.<BR>
The stranger, after long and earnest prayer,<BR>
Lifted to covering casque, and bared to view<BR>
What in the ensuing canto will appear,<BR>
If you are fain the history to hear.</TD></TR>
