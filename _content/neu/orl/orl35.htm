<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
The apostle praises authors to the peer.<BR>
Duke Aymon&#8217;s martial daughter in affray,<BR>
Conquers the giant monarch of Argier,<BR>
And of the good Frontino makes a prey.<BR>
She next from Arles defies her cavalier,<BR>
And, while he marvels who would him assay,<BR>
Grandonio and Ferrau she with her hand<BR>
And Serpentine unhorses on the strand.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Madonna, who will scale the high ascent<BR>
Of heaven, to me my judgment to restore,<BR>
Which, since from your bright eyes the weapon went,<BR>
That pierced my heart, is wasting evermore?<BR>
Yet will not I such mighty loss lament,<BR>
So that it drain no faster than before;<BR>
But&#8212;ebbing further&#8212;I should fear to be<BR>
Such as Orlando is described by me.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
To have anew that judgment, through the skies,<BR>
I deem there is no need for me to fly<BR>
To the moon&#8217;s circle, or to Paradise;<BR>
For, I believe, mine is not lodged so high.<BR>
On your bright visage, on your beauteous eyes,<BR>
Alabastrine neck, and paps of ivory,<BR>
Wander my wits, and I with busy lip,<BR>
If I may have them back, these fain would sip.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Astolpho wandered through that palace wide,<BR>
Observing al the future lives around:<BR>
When those already woven he had spied<BR>
Upon the fatal wheel for finish wound,<BR>
He a fair fleece discerned that far outvied<BR>
Fine gold, whose wondrous lustre jewels ground,<BR>
Could these into a thread be drawn by art,<BR>
Would never equal by the thousandth part.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
The beauteous fleece he saw with wondrous glee<BR>
Equalled by none amid that countless store;<BR>
And when and whose such glorious life should be,<BR>
Longed sore to know. &#8220;This,&#8221; (said the apostle hoar,<BR>
Concealing nothing of its history,)<BR>
&#8220;Shall have existence twenty years before,<BR>
Dating from THE INCARNATE WORD, the year<BR>
Shall marked my men with M and D appear;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, as for splendor and for substance fair,<BR>
This fleece shall have no like or equal, so<BR>
Shall the blest age wherein it shall appear<BR>
Be singular in this our world below;<BR>
Because all graces, excellent and rare,<BR>
Which Nature or which Study can bestow,<BR>
Or bounteous Fortune upon men can shower,<BR>
Shall be its certain and eternal dower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Between the king of rivers&#8217; horns,&#8221; (he cries,)<BR>
&#8220;Stands what is now a small and humble town.<BR>
Before it runs the Po, behind it lies<BR>
A misty pool of marsh; this&#8212;looking down<BR>
The stream of future years&#8212;I recognize<BR>
First of Italian cities of renown;<BR>
Not only famed for wall and palace rare,<BR>
But noble ways of life and studies fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Such exaltation, reached so suddenly,<BR>
Is not fortuitous nor wrought in vain;<BR>
But that is may his worthy cradle be,<BR>
Whereof I speak, shall so the heaven ordain.<BR>
For where men look for fruit they graff the tree,<BR>
And study still the rising plant to train;<BR>
And artist uses to refine the gold<BR>
Designed by him the precious gem to hold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor ever, in terrestrial realm, so fine<BR>
And fair a raiment spirit did invest,<BR>
And rarely soul so great from realms divine<BR>
Has been, or will be, thitherward addrest,<BR>
As that whereof THE ETERNAL had design<BR>
To fashion good Hippolytus of Este:<BR>
Hippolytus of Este shall he be hight,<BR>
On whom so rich a gift of God shall light.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;All those fair graces, that, on many spent,<BR>
Would have served many wholly to array,<BR>
Are all united for his ornament,<BR>
Of whom thou hast entreated me to say.<BR>
To prop the arts, the virtues is he sent;<BR>
And should I seek his merits to display,<BR>
So long a time would last my tedious strain,<BR>
Orlando might expect his wits in vain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas so Christ&#8217;s servant with the cavalier<BR>
Discoursed; they having satisfied their view<BR>
With sight of that fair mansion, far and near,<BR>
That whence conveyed were human lives, the two<BR>
Issued upon the stream, whose waves appear<BR>
Turbid with sand and of discoloured hue;<BR>
And found that ancient man upon the shore,<BR>
Who names, engraved on metal, thither bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
I know not if you recollect; of him<BR>
I speak, whose story I erewhile suspended,<BR>
Ancient of visage, and so swift of limb,<BR>
That faster far than forest stag he wended.<BR>
With names he filled his mantle to the brim,<BR>
Aye thinned the pile, but ne&#8217;er his labour ended;<BR>
And in that stream, hight Lethe, next bestowed,<BR>
Yea, rather cast away, his costly load.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
I say, that when upon the river side<BR>
Arrives that ancient, of his store profuse,<BR>
He all those names into the turbid tide<BR>
Discharges, as he shakes his mantle loose.<BR>
A countless shoal, they in the stream subside;<BR>
Nor henceforth are they fit for any use;<BR>
And, out of mighty myriads, hardly one<BR>
Is saved of those which waves and sand o&#8217;errun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Along that river and around it fly<BR>
Vile crows and ravening vultures, and a crew<BR>
Of choughs, and more, that with discordant cry<BR>
And deafening din their airy flight pursue;<BR>
And to the prey all hurry, when from high<BR>
Those ample riches they so scattered view;<BR>
And with their beak or talon seize the prey:<BR>
Yet little distance they their prize convey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
When they would raise themselves in upward flight,<BR>
They have not strength the burden to sustain;<BR>
So that parforce in Lethe&#8217;s water light<BR>
The worthy names, which lasting praise should gain.<BR>
Two swans there are amid those birds, as white,<BR>
My lord, as is your banner&#8217;s snowy grain;<BR>
Who catch what names they can, and evermore<BR>
With these return securely to the shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Thus, counter to that ancient&#8217;s will malign,<BR>
Who them to the devouring river dooms,<BR>
Some names are rescued by the birds benign;<BR>
Wasteful Oblivion all the rest consumes.<BR>
Now swim about the stream those swans divine,<BR>
Now beat the buxom air with nimble plumes,<BR>
Till, near that impious river&#8217;s bank, they gain<BR>
A hill, and on that hill a hallowed fane.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
To Immortality &#8217;tis sacred; there<BR>
A lovely nymph, that from the hill descends,<BR>
To the Lethean river makes repair;<BR>
Takes from those swans their burden, and suspends<BR>
The names about an image, raised in air<BR>
Upon a shaft, which in mid fane ascends;<BR>
There consecrates and fixes them so fast,<BR>
That all throughout eternity shall last.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Of that old sire, and why he would dispense<BR>
Idly, all those fair names, as &#8217;twould appear,<BR>
And of the birds and holy place, from whence<BR>
The nymph was to the river seen to steer,<BR>
The solemn mystery, and the secret sense,<BR>
Astolpho, marvelling, desired to hear;<BR>
And prayed the man of God would these unfold,<BR>
Who to the warrior thus their meaning told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;There moves no leaf beneath, thou hast to know,<BR>
But here above some sign thereof we trace;<BR>
Since all, in Heaven above or Earth below,<BR>
Must correspond, though with a different face.<BR>
That ancient, with his sweeping beard of snow,<BR>
By nought impeded and so swift of pace,<BR>
Works the same end and purpose in our clime,<BR>
As are on earth below performed by Time.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The life of man its final close attains,<BR>
When on the wheel is wound the fatal twine;<BR>
There fame, and here above the mark remains;<BR>
For both would be immortal and divine,<BR>
But for that bearded sire&#8217;s unwearied pains,<BR>
And his below, that for their wreck combine.<BR>
One drowns them, as thou seest, mid sand and surges.<BR>
And one in long forgetfulness immerges.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And even, as here above, the raven, daw,<BR>
Vulture, and divers other birds of air,<BR>
All from the turbid water seek to draw<BR>
The names, which in their sight appear most fair;<BR>
Even thus below, pimps, flatterers, men of straw,<BR>
Buffoons, informers, minions, all who there<BR>
Flourish in courts, and in far better guise<BR>
And better odour, than the good and wise;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And by the crowd are gentle courtiers hight,<BR>
Because they imitate the ass and swine:<BR>
When the just Parcae or (to speak aright)<BR>
Venus and Bacchus cut their master&#8217;s twine,<BR>
&#8212;These base and sluggish dullards, whom I cite&#8212;<BR>
Born but to blow themselves with bread and wine,<BR>
In their vile mouths awhile such names convey,<BR>
Then drop the load, which is Oblivion&#8217;s prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But as the joyful swans, that, singing sweet,<BR>
Convey the medals safely to the fane,<BR>
So they whose praises poets well repeat,<BR>
Are rescued from oblivion, direr pain<BR>
Than death. O Princes, wary and discreet,<BR>
That wisely tread in Caesar&#8217;s steps, and gain<BR>
Authors for friends! They, doubt it not, shall save<BR>
Your noble names from Lethe&#8217;s laxy wave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Rare as those gentle swans are poets too,<BR>
That well the poet&#8217;s name have merited,<BR>
As well because it is Heaven&#8217;s will, that few<BR>
Great rulers should the paths of glory tread,<BR>
As through foul fault of sordid lordlings, who<BR>
Let sacred Genius beg his daily bread;<BR>
Who putting down the Virtues, raise the tribe<BR>
Of Vices, and the liberal arts proscribe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Believe it, that these ignorant men should be<BR>
Blind and deprived of judgment, is God&#8217;s doom;<BR>
Who makes them loathe the light of poetry,<BR>
That envious Death may wholly them consume.<BR>
Besides that Song can quicken and set free<BR>
Him that is prisoned in the darkness tomb,<BR>
Though foul his name, if Cirrha him befriend.<BR>
Its savour myrrh and spikenard shall transcend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Aeneas not so pious, nor of arm<BR>
So strong Achilles, Hector not so bold,<BR>
Was, as &#8217;tis famed; and mid the nameless swarm,<BR>
Thousands and thousands higher rank might hold:<BR>
But gift of palace and of plenteous farm,<BR>
Bestowed by heirs of them, whose deeds they told,<BR>
Have moved the poet with his honoured hand,<BR>
To place them upon Glory&#8217;s highest stand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Augustus not so holy and benign<BR>
Was as great Virgil&#8217;s trumpet sounds his name,<BR>
Because he savoured the harmonious line.<BR>
His foul proscription passes without blame.<BR>
That Nero was unjust would none divine,<BR>
Nor haply would he suffer in his fame,<BR>
Though Heaven and Earth were hostile, had he known<BR>
The means to make the tuneful tribe his own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Homer a conqueror Agamemnon shows,<BR>
And makes the Trojan seem of coward vein,<BR>
And from the suitors, faithful to her vows,<BR>
Penelope a thousand wrongs sustain:<BR>
Yet&#8212;would&#8217;st thou I the secret should expose?&#8212;<BR>
By contraries throughout the tale explain:<BR>
That from the Trojan bands the Grecian ran;<BR>
And deem Penelope a courtezan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What fame Eliza, she so chaste of sprite,<BR>
On the other hand, has left behind her, hear!<BR>
Who widely is a wanton baggage hight,<BR>
Solely that she to Maro was not dear,<BR>
Marvel not this should cause me sore despite,<BR>
And if my speech diffusive should appear.<BR>
Authors I love, and pay the debt I owe,<BR>
Speaking their praise; an author I below!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;There earned I, above all men, what no more<BR>
Time nor yet Death from me shall take away;<BR>
And it behoved our Lord, of whom I bore<BR>
Such testimony, so my paints to pay.<BR>
It grieves me much for them, on whom her door<BR>
Courtesy closes on a stormy day;<BR>
Who meagre, pale, and worn with hopeless suit,<BR>
Knock night and day, and ever without fruit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Henceforth with that apostle let the peer<BR>
Remain; for I have now to make a spring<BR>
As far as &#8217;tis from heaven to earth; for here<BR>
I cannot hang for ever on the wing.<BR>
I to the dame return, who was whilere<BR>
Wounded by jealousy with cruel sting.<BR>
I left her where, successively o&#8217;erthrown,<BR>
Three kings she quickly upon earth had strown;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
And afterwards arriving in a town,<BR>
At eve, which on the road to Paris lay,<BR>
Heard tidings of Rinaldo&#8217;s victory blown;<BR>
And how in Arles the vanquished paynim lay.<BR>
&#8212;Sure, her Rogero with the king is gone&#8212;<BR>
As soon as reappears the dawning day,<BR>
Towards fair Provence, whither (as she hears)<BR>
King Charlemagne pursues, her way she steers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
She towards Provence, by the nearest road,<BR>
So journeying, met a maid of mournful air;<BR>
Who, though her cheeks with tears were overflowed,<BR>
Was yet of visage and of manners fair.<BR>
She was it, so transfixed with Love&#8217;s keen goad,<BR>
Who sighed for Monodante&#8217;s valiant heir,<BR>
Who at the bridge had left her lord a thrall,<BR>
When with King Rodomont he tried a fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
She sought one of an otter&#8217;s nimbleness,<BR>
By water and by land, a cavalier<BR>
So fierce, that she that champion&#8212;to redress<BR>
Her wrongs&#8212;might match against the paynim peer.<BR>
When good Rogero&#8217;s lady, comfortless,<BR>
To that fair dame, as comfortless, drew near,<BR>
Her she saluted courteously, and next<BR>
Demanded by what sorrow she was vext.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Flordelice marked the maid, that, in her sight,<BR>
Appeared a warrior fitted for her needs;<BR>
And of the bridge and river &#8217;gan recite,<BR>
Where Argier&#8217;s mighty king the road impedes;<BR>
And how he had gone nigh to slay her knight;<BR>
Not that more doughty were the monarch&#8217;s deeds;<BR>
But that the wily paynim vantage-ground<BR>
In that streight bridge and foaming river found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Are you (she said) so daring and so kind,<BR>
As kind and daring you appear in show,<BR>
Venge me of him that has my lord confined,<BR>
And makes me wander thus, opprest with woe,<BR>
For love of Heaven; or teach me where to find<BR>
At least a knight who can resist the foe,<BR>
And of such skill that little boot shall bring<BR>
His bridge and river to the pagan king.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Besides that so you shall achieve an end,<BR>
Befitting courteous man and cavalier,<BR>
You will employ your valour to befriend<BR>
The faithfullest of lovers far and near.<BR>
His other virtues I should ill commend,<BR>
So many and so many, that whoe&#8217;er<BR>
Knoweth not these, may well be said to be<BR>
One without ears to hear or eyes to see.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
The high-minded maid, to whom aye welcome are<BR>
All noble quests, by which she worthily<BR>
May hope a great and glorious name to bear,<BR>
Straight to the paynim&#8217;s bridge resolves to hie;<BR>
And now so much the more&#8212;as in despair&#8212;<BR>
Wends willingly, although it were to die:<BR>
In that she, ever with herself at strife,<BR>
Deeming Rogero lost, detested life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O loving damsel (she made answer), I<BR>
Offer mine aid, for such as &#8217;tis, to do<BR>
The hard and dread adventure, passing by<BR>
Causes beside that move me, most that you<BR>
A matter of your lover testify,<BR>
Which I, in sooth, hear warranted of few;<BR>
That he is constant; for i&#8217;faith I swear,<BR>
I well believed all lovers perjured were.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
With these last words a sigh that damsel drew,<BR>
A sigh which issued from her heart; then said:<BR>
&#8220;Go we&#8221;; and, with the following sun, those two<BR>
At the deep stream arrived and bridge of dread:<BR>
&#8212;Seen of the guard, that on his bugle blew<BR>
A warning blast, when strangers thither sped&#8212;<BR>
The pagan arms him, girds his goodly brand,<BR>
And takes upon the bridge his wonted stand;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
And as the maid appears in martial scale,<BR>
The moody monarch threatens her to slay,<BR>
Unless her goodly courser and her mail,<BR>
As an oblation to the tomb she pay.<BR>
Fair Bradamant who knew the piteous tale,<BR>
How murdered by him Isabella lay,<BR>
The story gentle Flordelice had taught;<BR>
Replied in answer to that paynim haught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Wherefore, O brutish man, for your misdeed<BR>
Should penance by the innocent be done?<BR>
&#8217;Tis fitting to appease her you should bleed;<BR>
You killed her, and to all the deed is known.<BR>
So that, of trophied armour or of weed<BR>
Of those so many, by your lance o&#8217;erthrown,<BR>
Your armour should the blest oblation be,<BR>
And you the choicest victim, slain by me;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And dearer shall the gift be from my hand;<BR>
Since I a woman am, as she whilere;<BR>
Nor save to venge her have I sought this strand;<BR>
In this desire alone I hither steer:<BR>
But first, &#8217;tis good some pact we understand,<BR>
Before we prove our prowess with the spear:<BR>
You shall do by me, if o&#8217;erthrown, what you<BR>
By other prisoners have been wont to do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if, as I believe and trust, you fall,<BR>
I will your horse and armour have (she cried),<BR>
And taking down all others from the wall,<BR>
Hang on the tomb alone those arms of pride;<BR>
And will that you release each warlike thrall.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;The pact is just (King Rodomont replied),<BR>
But those, my prisoners, are not here confined,<BR>
And therefore cannot be to you consigned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;These have I sent into mine Africk reign;<BR>
But this I promise thee, and pledge my fay;<BR>
If, by strange fortune, thou thy seat maintain,<BR>
And I shall be dismounted in the fray;<BR>
Delivered, all, shall be the captive train,<BR>
Within what time suffices to convey<BR>
An order thither, that they our of hand<BR>
&#8216;Should do what thou, if conqueror, may&#8217;st command.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But art thou undermost, as fitter were,<BR>
And, as thou surely wilt be, I from thee<BR>
Not therefore will thy forfeit armour tear,<BR>
Nor shall thy name inscribed, as vanquished, be.<BR>
To thy bright face, bright eyes, and beauteous hair,<BR>
All breathing love and grace, the victory<BR>
Will I resign; let it suffice that thou<BR>
Then stoop to love me, as thou hatest now.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To fall by me thou needest not disdain;<BR>
I with such strength, such nerve am fortified.&#8221;<BR>
Somedeal she smiled; but smiled in bitter vein;<BR>
Savouring of anger more than aught beside.<BR>
She spake not to that haughty man again,<BR>
To the bridge-end returned the damsel, plied<BR>
Her courser with the rowels, couched her spear,<BR>
And rode to meet the furious cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
King Rodomont prepares his course to run;<BR>
Comes on at speed; and with such mighty sound<BR>
Echoes that bridge, the thundering noise might stun<BR>
The ears of many distant from the ground.<BR>
The golden lance its wonted work has done;<BR>
For that fierce Moor, in tourney so renowned,<BR>
This from the saddle lifts, in air suspends,<BR>
Then headlong on the narrow bridge extends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Scarce for her horse the martial damsel can<BR>
Find space to pass, when she has thrown her foe;<BR>
And little lacked, and mighty risque she ran<BR>
Of falling into that deep stream below:<BR>
But, born of wind and flame, good Rabican<BR>
So dextrous was, and could so lightly go,<BR>
He picked a path along the outer ledge,<BR>
And could have paced upon a faulchion&#8217;s edge.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
The damsel wheeled, towards the cavalier<BR>
Returned, and him bespoke in sportive way;<BR>
&#8220;Who is the loser now to thee is clear,<BR>
And who is undermost in this assay.&#8221;<BR>
Silent remained the monarch of Argier,<BR>
Amazed, that woman him on earth should lay.<BR>
He cannot, or he will not speak; and lies<BR>
On earth, like one astound, in idiot guise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Silent and sad, he raised himself from ground,<BR>
And when he some few paces thence had gone,<BR>
His shield unbraced and helm and mail unbound,<BR>
He flung against the tomb; and thence, alone,<BR>
Afoot the moody monarch left that ground:<BR>
Yet not till he had given command to one<BR>
(Of his four squires was he) to do his hest<BR>
Relating to those captives, as exprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
He parts; and save that in a caverned cell<BR>
He dwelt, no further news of him were known:<BR>
Meanwhile the harness of that infidel<BR>
Bradamant hung upon the lofty stone;<BR>
And having thence removed all plate and shell<BR>
Wherewith (as by the writing it was shown)<BR>
The cavaliers of Charles their limbs had drest,<BR>
She moved not, nor let other move, the rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Besides the arms of Monodantes&#8217; heir<BR>
Were those of Sansonet and Olivier,<BR>
Who, bound in search of good Orlando, were<BR>
Thither conducted by the road most near.<BR>
The day before here taken was the pair,<BR>
And sent by that proud paynim to Argier:<BR>
These warriors&#8217; arms the martial maid bade lower<BR>
From that fair tomb, and stored them in the tower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
All others, taken from the paynim train,<BR>
Bradamant left suspended from the stone;<BR>
Mid these a king&#8217;s, that idly and in vain,<BR>
Had thither, seeking Frontalatte, gone:<BR>
I say his arms, that ruled Circassia&#8217;s reign;<BR>
Who, after wandering long, by date and down,<BR>
Here to his grief another courser left,<BR>
And lightly went his way, of arms bereft.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Stript of his armour and afoot, did part<BR>
That paynim monarch from the bridge of dread;<BR>
As Rodomont permitted to depart<BR>
Those other knights that in his faith were bred:<BR>
But to his camp to wend he had no heart,<BR>
For there he was ashamed to show his head:<BR>
Since, in such fashion, thither to return<BR>
After his boasts, had been too foul a scorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Yet still with new desire the warrior burned<BR>
To seek her, fixed alone in his heart&#8217;s core;<BR>
And such the monarch&#8217;s chance, he quickly learned<BR>
(I cannot tell you who the tidings bore)<BR>
She was towards her native land returned.<BR>
Hence, as Love spurs and goads him evermore,<BR>
He bowns him straight her footsteps to pursue:<BR>
But I to Bradamant return anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
When she in other writing had displaid<BR>
How she had freed that passage from the foe,<BR>
To mournful Flordelice the martial maid,<BR>
She that still held her weeping visage low,<BR>
Turned her, and courteously that lady prayed<BR>
To tell her whither she designed to go.<BR>
To her afflicted Flordelice replied:<BR>
&#8220;To Arles, where camp the paynims, would I ride.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Which bark (I hope) and fitting company,<BR>
To carry me to Africk may afford;<BR>
Nor will I halt upon my way, till I<BR>
Once more rejoin my husband and my lord;<BR>
All means and measures there resolved to try,<BR>
That may release him from his jailer&#8217;s ward;<BR>
And should the Saracen deceitful prove,<BR>
Others, and others yet, I mean to move.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My company (replied the martial fair)<BR>
For some part of the road, I offer thee,<BR>
Till we have sight of Arles; then to repair<BR>
Thither, will pray you, for the love of me,<BR>
To find King Agramant&#8217;s Rogero there,<BR>
Whose glorious name is spread o&#8217;er land and sea,<BR>
And render to that knight this goodly horse,<BR>
Whence the proud Moor was flung in martial course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Say thus, from point to point, &#8216;A cavalier<BR>
That would in combat prove his chivalry,<BR>
And to the world at large would fain make clear<BR>
Thy breach of faith with him, that thou may&#8217;st be<BR>
Ready and well prepared for the career,<BR>
Gave me this horse, that I might give it thee.<BR>
He bids thee promptly mail and corslet dight,<BR>
And wait him, who with thee will wage the fight.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Say this and nought beside, and would he hear<BR>
My name, declare that &#8217;tis to thee unknown.&#8221;<BR>
With wonted kindness cried that dame, &#8220;I ne&#8217;er<BR>
In spending life itself, not words alone,<BR>
Should weary in your service; since whilere<BR>
You would in my behalf as much have done.&#8221;<BR>
Her Aymon&#8217;s daughter thanked in courteous strain,<BR>
And to her hand consigned Frontino&#8217;s rein.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Through long days&#8217; journey, by that river-shore,<BR>
Together go the lovely pilgrim pair,<BR>
Till they see Arles, and hear the hollow roar.<BR>
Of billows breaking on the sea-beach bare.<BR>
Almost without the suburbs, and before<BR>
The furthest barrier, stops the martial fair;<BR>
To furnish Flordelice what time might need<BR>
For the conveyance of Rogero&#8217;s steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
She forward rode, within the enclosure sped,<BR>
And o&#8217;er the bridge and through the gateway wended,<BR>
And (furnished with a guide, who thither led)<BR>
To young Rogero&#8217;s inn; and there descended.<BR>
She to the Child, as bid, her message said,<BR>
And gave the courser, to her care commended:<BR>
Then (for she waits not for an answer) speeds<BR>
In haste to execute her proper needs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Rogero stands confused; he finds no end<BR>
To his perplexing thoughts, and cannot see<BR>
Who should defy him, who that message send,<BR>
To speak him ill, and do him courtesy.<BR>
Who thus as faithless him should reprehend,<BR>
Or any reprehend, whoe&#8217;er it be,<BR>
Nor knows he nor imagines; least of all<BR>
On Bradamant the knight&#8217;s suspicions fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
To think &#8217;twas Rodomont the youthful peer<BR>
Was more inclined than any other wight;<BR>
And wherefore even from him he this should hear,<BR>
Muses, nor can the cause divine aright;<BR>
Save him, in all the world the cavalier<BR>
Knows not of one, that has him at despite.<BR>
Meanwhile Dordona&#8217;s lady craved the field;<BR>
And loud that martial damsel&#8217;s bugle pealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
To Agramant and King Marsilius flew<BR>
The news, that one craved battle on the plain.<BR>
Serpentine stood by chance before the two,<BR>
And gained their leave to don his plate and chain,<BR>
And vowed to take that haughty man; the crew<BR>
Of people over wall and rampart strain;<BR>
Nor child nor elder was there, but he pressed<BR>
To see which champion should bestir him best.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
In beauteous arms and costly surcoat drest,<BR>
Serpentine of the star to combat sped;<BR>
The ground he at the first encounter prest;<BR>
As if equipt with wings, his courser fled.<BR>
The damsel flew his charger to arrest,<BR>
And by the bride to that paynim led,<BR>
Exclaiming: &#8220;Mount, and bid your monarch send<BR>
A knight that better can with me contend.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
The Moorish king, that on the rampart&#8217;s height<BR>
Stood, with a mighty following, next the plain,<BR>
Marking the joust, much marvelled at the sight<BR>
Of the foe&#8217;s courtesy to him of Spain.<BR>
&#8220;He takes him not, although he may of right,&#8221;<BR>
He cries i&#8217; the hearing of the paynim train.<BR>
Serpentine comes, and, as the maid commands,<BR>
A better warrior of that king demands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Grandonio de Volterna, fierce of mood,<BR>
And in all Spain the proudest cavalier,<BR>
The second for that fell encounter stood,<BR>
Such favour had his suit obtained whilere.<BR>
&#8220;To thee thy courtesy shall do no good,&#8221;<BR>
He threats, &#8220;for if unhorsed in the career<BR>
A prisoner to my lord shalt thou be led:<BR>
But, if I fight as wonted, thou art dead.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
She cries, &#8220;I would not thy discourtesy<BR>
Should make me so forget my courteous vein,<BR>
But that aforehand I should caution thee<BR>
Back to thy fortress to return again,<BR>
Ere on hard earth thy bones shall battered be.<BR>
Go tell thy king no champion of thy grain<BR>
I seek, but hither come to crave the fight<BR>
With warrior that is worthy of my might.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Bradamant&#8217;s sharp and stinging answer stirred<BR>
The paynim&#8217;s fury to a mighty flame;<BR>
So that, without the power to speak a word,<BR>
He wheeled his courser, filled with rage and shame;<BR>
Wheeling as well, at that proud paynim spurred<BR>
Her horse with levelled lance the warlike dame.<BR>
As the charmed weapon smites Grandonio&#8217;s shield,<BR>
With heels in air, he tumbles on the field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
To him the high-minded damsel gave his horse,<BR>
And said, &#8220;Yet was this fate to thee foreshown,<BR>
Instead of craving thus the knightly course,<BR>
Better mine embassy wouldst thou have done.<BR>
Some other knight, that equals me in force,<BR>
I pray thee bid the Moorish king send down,<BR>
Nor weary me, by forcing me to meet<BR>
Champions like thee, untried in martial feat.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
They on the walls, that know not who the peer<BR>
That in the joust so well maintains his seat,<BR>
Name many a warrior, famous in career,<BR>
That often make them shake in fiercest heat.<BR>
Brandimart many deem the cavalier;<BR>
More guesses in renowned Rinaldo meet;<BR>
Many would deem Orlando was the knight,<BR>
But that they knew his pitiable plight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
The third encounter craved Lanfusa&#8217;s son,<BR>
And cried, &#8220;Not that I better hope to fare,<BR>
But that to warriors who this course have run,<BR>
My fall may furnish an excuse more fair.&#8221;<BR>
Next, with all arms that martial jousters don,<BR>
Clothed him, and of a hundred steeds that were<BR>
Ready for service, kept in lordly stall,<BR>
For speed and action chose the best of all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
He bowned him for the tournay, on his side<BR>
But first saluted her and she the knight.<BR>
&#8220;If &#8217;tis allowed to ask,&#8221; (the lady cried,)<BR>
&#8220;Tell me in courtesy how ye are hight.&#8221;<BR>
In this Ferrau the damsel satisfied,<BR>
Who rarely hid himself form living wight.<BR>
&#8220;Ye will I not refuse,&#8221; (subjoined the dame)<BR>
&#8220;Albeit I to meet another came.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8212;&#8220;And who?&#8221; the Spaniard said;&#8212;the maid replied,<BR>
&#8220;Rogero&#8221;; and pronounced the word with pain.<BR>
And, in so saying, her fair face was dyed<BR>
All over with the rose&#8217;s crimson grain.<BR>
She after added, &#8220;Hither have I hied,<BR>
To prove how justly famed his might and main.<BR>
No other care have I, no other call,<BR>
But with that gentle youth to try a fall.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
She spoke the word in all simplicity,<BR>
Which some already may in malice wrest.<BR>
Ferrau replied, &#8220;Assured I first must be<BR>
Which of us two is schooled in warfare best,<BR>
If what has chanced to many, falls on me,<BR>
Hither, when I return, shall be addrest,<BR>
To mend my fault, that gentle cavalier,<BR>
With whom you so desire to break a spear.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Discoursing all this while, the martial maid<BR>
Spake with her beavor up, without disguise:<BR>
Ferrau, as that fair visage he surveyed,<BR>
Perceived he was half vanquished by its eyes.<BR>
And to himself, in under tone, he said,<BR>
&#8220;He seems an angel sent from Paradise;<BR>
And, though he should not harm me with his lance,<BR>
I am already quelled by that sweet glance.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
They take their ground, and to the encounter ride,<BR>
And, like those others, Ferrau goes to ground;<BR>
His courser Bradamant retained, and cried,<BR>
&#8220;Return, and keep thy word with me as bound.&#8221;<BR>
Shamed, he returned, and by his monarch&#8217;s side,<BR>
Among his peers, the young Rogero found;<BR>
And let the stripling know the stranger knight,<BR>
Without the walls, defied him to the fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Rogero (for not yet that warrior knows<BR>
What champion him in duel would assail)<BR>
Nigh sure of victory, with transport glows,<BR>
And bids his followers bring his plate and mail;<BR>
Nor having seen beneath those heavy blows<BR>
The rest dismounted, makes his spirit quail.<BR>
But how he armed, how sallied, what befell<BR>
That knight, in other canto will I tell.</TD></TR>
