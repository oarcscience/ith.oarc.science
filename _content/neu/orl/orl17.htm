<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Charles goes, with his, against King Rodomont.<BR>
Gryphon in Norandino&#8217;s tournament<BR>
Does mighty deeds; Martano turns his front,<BR>
Showing how recreant is his natural bent;<BR>
And next, on Gryphon to bring down affront,<BR>
Stole from the knight the arms in which he went;<BR>
Hence by the kindly monarch much esteemed,<BR>
And Gryphon scorned, whom he Martano deemed.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
God, outraged by our rank iniquity,<BR>
Whenever crimes have past remission&#8217;s bound,<BR>
That mercy may with justice mingled be,<BR>
Has monstrous and destructive tyrants crowned;<BR>
And gifted them with force and subtlety,<BR>
A sinful world to punish and confound.<BR>
Marius and Sylla to this end were nursed,<BR>
Rome with two Neros and a Caius cursed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Domitian and the latter Antonine;<BR>
And, lifted from the lowest rabble&#8217;s lees,<BR>
To imperial place and puissance, Maximine:<BR>
Hence Thebes to cruel Creon bent her knees,<BR>
Mezentius ruled the subject Agiline,<BR>
Fattening his fields with blood. To pests like these<BR>
Our Italy was given in later day,<BR>
To Lombard, Goth, and Hun a bleeding prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
What shall I of fierce Attila, what say<BR>
Of wicked Ezzeline, and hundreds more?<BR>
Whom, because men still trod the crooked way,<BR>
God sent them for their pain and torment sore.<BR>
Of this ourselves have made a clear assay,<BR>
As well as those who lived in days of yore;<BR>
Consigned to ravening wolves, ordained to keep<BR>
Us, his ill-nurturing and unuseful sheep;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Who, as if having more than served to fill<BR>
Their hungry maw, invite from foreign wood<BR>
Beyond the mountain, wolves of greedier will,<BR>
With them to be partakers of their food.<BR>
The bones which Thrasymene and Trebbia fill,<BR>
And Cannae, seem but few to what are strewed<BR>
On fattened field and bank, where on their way<BR>
Adda and Mella, Ronco and Tarro stray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Now God permits that we should feel the spite<BR>
Of people, who are haply worse than we,<BR>
For errors multiplied and infinite,<BR>
And foul and pestilent iniquity.<BR>
The time will come we may such ill requite<BR>
Upon their shores, if we shall better be,<BR>
And their transgressions ever prove above<BR>
The long endurance of AETERNAL LOVE.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
The Christian people then God&#8217;s placid front<BR>
Must have disturbed with their excesses sore;<BR>
Since them with slaughter, rape, and rapine hunt,<BR>
Through all their quarters, plundering Turk and Moor:<BR>
But the unsparing rage of Rodomont<BR>
Proves worse than all the ills endured before.<BR>
I said that Charlemagne had made repair<BR>
In search of him towards the city square.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Charles, by the way, his people&#8217;s butchery<BR>
Beholds&#8212;burnt palaces and ruined fanes&#8212;<BR>
And sees large portion of the city lie<BR>
In unexampled wreck.&#8212;&#8220;Ye coward trains,<BR>
Whither in heartless panic would ye fly?<BR>
Will none his loss contemplate? what remains<BR>
To you,&#8212;what place of refuge, say, is left,<BR>
If this from you so shamefully be reft?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then shall one man alone, a prisoned foe,<BR>
Who cannot scale the walls which round him spread,<BR>
Unscathed, unquestioned, from your city go,<BR>
When all are by his vengeful arm laid dead?&#8221;<BR>
Thus Charlemagne, whose veins with anger glow,<BR>
And shame, too strong to brook, in fury said;<BR>
And to the spacious square made good his way,<BR>
Where he beheld the foe his people slay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Thither large portion of the populace,<BR>
Climbing the palace roof, had made resort;<BR>
For strongly walled, and furnished was the place<BR>
With ammunition, for their long support.<BR>
Rodomont, mad with pride, had, in his chace<BR>
Of the scared burghers, singly cleared the court,<BR>
He with one daring hand, which scorned the world,<BR>
Brandished the sword;&#8212;his other wildfire hurled;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
And smote and thundered, &#8217;mid a fearful shower,<BR>
At the sublime and royal house&#8217;s gate.<BR>
To their life&#8217;s peril, crumbling roof and tower<BR>
Is tost by them that on the summit wait:<BR>
Nor any fears to ruin hall or bower;<BR>
But wood and stone endure one common fate,<BR>
And marbled column, slab, and gilded beam,<BR>
By sire and grandsire held in high esteem.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Rodomont stands before the portal, bright<BR>
With steel, his head and bust secured in mail,<BR>
Like to a serpent, issued into light,<BR>
Having cast off his slough, diseased and stale:<BR>
Who more than ever joying in his might,<BR>
Renewed in youth, and proud of polished scale,<BR>
Darts his three tongues, fire flashing from his eyes;<BR>
While every frighted beast before him flies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Nor bulwark, stone, nor arbalest, nor bow,<BR>
Nor what upon the paynim smote beside,<BR>
Sufficed to arrest the sanguinary foe;<BR>
Who broke and hewed, and shook that portal wide,<BR>
And in his fury let such day-light through,<BR>
&#8217;Twas easy to espy&#8212;and might be spied&#8212;<BR>
In visages o&#8217;ercast in death-like sort,<BR>
That full of people was the palace court.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Through those fair chambers echoed shouts of dread,<BR>
And feminine lament from dame distrest;<BR>
And grieving, through the house, pale women fled,<BR>
Who wept, afflicted sore, and beat their breast.<BR>
And hugged the door-post and the genial bed,<BR>
Too soon to be by stranger lords possest.<BR>
The matter in this state of peril hung<BR>
When thither came the king, his peers among.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Charles turned him round to these, of vigorous hand,<BR>
Whom he had found in former peril true.<BR>
&#8220;Are you not those that erst with me did stand<BR>
&#8217;Gainst Agolant in Aspramont? In you<BR>
Is vigour now so spent, (he said), the band,<BR>
Who him, Troyano, and Almontes slew,<BR>
With hundreds more, that you now fear to face<BR>
One of that very blood, that very race?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Why should I now in contest with the foe<BR>
Less strength in you behold than them? Your might<BR>
Upon this hound (pursued the monarch) show;<BR>
This hound who preys on man.&#8212;A generous sprite<BR>
The thought of death&#8212;approach he fast or slow&#8212;<BR>
So that he dies but well, holds cheap and light.<BR>
But where you are, I doubt my fortune ill,<BR>
For by your succour, have I conquered still.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
This said, he spurred his courser, couched his spear,<BR>
And charged the paynim; nor of life less free,<BR>
Sir Ogier joined the king in his career;<BR>
Namus and Oliver; and, with the three,<BR>
Avino, Avolio, Otho, and Berlinghier:<BR>
(For one without the rest I never see)<BR>
And on the bosom, flanks, and on the front,<BR>
All smote together at King Rodomont.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
But let us, sir, for love of Heaven, forego<BR>
Of anger and of death the noisome lore;<BR>
And be it deemed that I have said enow,<BR>
For this while, of that Saracen, not more<BR>
Cruel than strong; &#8217;tis time in trace to go<BR>
Of Gryphon, left with Origille, before<BR>
Damascus&#8217; gate, and him who with her came,<BR>
The adulterer, not the brother of the dame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Of all the cities under eastern skies,<BR>
Most wealthy, populous, and fairly dight,<BR>
&#8217;Tis said, Damascus is; which distant lies<BR>
From Salem seven days&#8217; journey; its fair site,<BR>
A fertile plain, abundant fruits supplies,<BR>
Winter and summer, sojourn of delight.<BR>
Shading the city from the dawning day,<BR>
A mountain intercepts its early ray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Two crystal streams the wealthy city scower;<BR>
Whose currents, parted into many a rill,<BR>
Infinite gardens, never bare of flower,<BR>
Or stript of leaf, with grateful murmur fill:<BR>
&#8217;Tis said the perfumed waters are of power<BR>
(So plenteously they swell) to turn a mill;<BR>
And that whoever wander through the streets,<BR>
Scent, issuing from each home, a cloud of sweets.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Then the high-street gay signs of triumph wore,<BR>
Covered with showy cloths of different dye,<BR>
Which deck the walls, while sylvan leaves in store,<BR>
And scented herbs upon the pavement lie.<BR>
Adorned is every window, every door,<BR>
With carpeting and finest drapery;<BR>
But more with ladies fair, and richly drest,<BR>
In costly jewels and in gorgeous vest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Within the city gates in frolic sport,<BR>
Many are seen to ply the festive dance;<BR>
And here the burghers of the better sort<BR>
Upon their gay and well-trapt coursers prance.<BR>
A fairer show remains; the sumptuous court<BR>
Of barons bold and vassals, who advance,<BR>
Garnished with what could be procured, of ore<BR>
And pearl, from Ind and Erythraean shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Forward Sir Gryphon pricked, with his array,<BR>
Surveying, here and there, the whole at ease;<BR>
When them a knight arrested by the way,<BR>
And (such his wont and natural courtesies)<BR>
Obliged beneath his palace-roof to stay;<BR>
Where he let nought be wanting which might please;<BR>
And chearfully the guests, with bath restored,<BR>
Next welcomed at his costly supper-board;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
And told how he, who, Norandino hight,<BR>
Damascus and all Syria&#8217;s kingdom swayed,<BR>
Native and foreigner had bade invite,<BR>
On whom the sword of knighthood had been laid,<BR>
To a fair joust, which at the morrow&#8217;s light,<BR>
Ensuing, in the square was to be made.<BR>
Where they might show, and without further faring,<BR>
If they had valour equal to their bearing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Gryphon, though he came not that joust to see,<BR>
Accepts the challenge of the cavalier;<BR>
For when occasion serves, it cannot be<BR>
An evil use to make our worth appear:<BR>
Then questioned more of that solemnity;<BR>
&#8212;If &#8217;twere a wonted feast, held every year,<BR>
Or new emprise; by which, in martial course,<BR>
The monarch would assay his warriors&#8217; force.&#8212;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The gorgeous feast our monarch will display<BR>
Each fourth succeeding moon,&#8221; the baron said;<BR>
&#8220;This is the first that you will now survey;<BR>
None have been held beside. The cause which bred<BR>
The solemn usage is, that on such day<BR>
The king from sovereign peril saved his head,<BR>
After four months, consumed in doleful wise,<BR>
&#8217;Mid tears and groans, with death before his eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Our monarch, who is named king Norandine<BR>
(Fully to you the matter to recite),<BR>
Through many and many a year for her did pine,<BR>
Above all other damsels fair and bright,<BR>
The king of Cyprus&#8217; daughter; whom, in fine,<BR>
Espoused, he, with his bride, and dame, and knight,<BR>
To wait upon her home, a fair array,<BR>
Towards his Syrian realm had shaped his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But as we scoured the fell Carpathian sea,<BR>
With flowing sheet, at distance from the shore,<BR>
A storm assailed us, of such cruelty,<BR>
The tempest even scared our pilot hoar.<BR>
Drifting three days and nights at random, we<BR>
Our devious course &#8217;mid threatening waves explore;<BR>
Then, wet and weary, land &#8217;mid verdant hills,<BR>
Between well-shaded and refreshing rills.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;We our pavilions pitch, and, &#8217;mid those groves,<BR>
Joyfully strain our awnings overhead;<BR>
And kitchens there construct, and rustic stoves,<BR>
And carpets for the intended banquet spread.<BR>
Meanwhile through neighbouring vale the monarch roves,<BR>
And secret wood, scarce pervious to the tread,<BR>
Seeking red deer, goat, fallow-buck, and doe;<BR>
And, following him, two servants bear his bow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;While, with much solace, seated in a round,<BR>
We from the chace expect our lord&#8217;s return,<BR>
Approaching us along the shore, astound,<BR>
The orc, that fearful monster, we discern.<BR>
God grant, fair sir, he never may confound<BR>
Your eyesight with his semblance foul and stern!<BR>
Better it is of him by fame to hear,<BR>
Than to behold him by approaching near.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To calculate the griesly monster&#8217;s height,<BR>
(So measureless is he) exceeds all skill;<BR>
Of fungus-hue, in place of orbs of sight,<BR>
Their sockets two small bones like berries fill.<BR>
Towards us, as I say, he speeds outright<BR>
Along the shore, and seems a moving hill.<BR>
Tusks jutting out like savage swine he shows,<BR>
A breast with drivel foul, and pointed nose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Running, the monster comes, and bears his snout<BR>
In guise of brach, who enters on the trail.<BR>
We who behold him fly (a helpless rout),<BR>
Wherever terror drives, with visage pale.<BR>
&#8217;Tis little comfort, that he is without<BR>
Eye-sight, who winds his plunder in the gale,<BR>
Better than aught possest of scent and sight:<BR>
And wing and plume were needed for our flight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Some here, some there make off, but little gain<BR>
By flying him; for swifter is the pest<BR>
Than the south wind. Of forty, ten, with pain,<BR>
Swimming aboard the bark in safety rest.<BR>
Under his arm some wretches of our train<BR>
He packed, nor empty left his lap or breast:<BR>
And loaded a capacious scrip beside,<BR>
Which, like a shepherd&#8217;s, to his waist was tied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Us to his den the sightless monster carried,<BR>
Hollowed within a rock, upon the shore;<BR>
Of snowy marble was that cavern quarried,<BR>
As white as leaf, unstained by inky score.<BR>
With him within the cave a matron tarried,<BR>
Who marked by grief and pain a visage wore.<BR>
With her were wife and maid, a numerous court,<BR>
Both fair and foul, of every age and sort.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Large as the other, and that grotto near,<BR>
Almost upon the summit of the rock,<BR>
Another cavern was contrived, to rear,<BR>
And from the weather fend his woolly flock,<BR>
Which he still herded through the changeful year;<BR>
So numerous, it were hard to count his stock:<BR>
Wont in due season these to pen or loose,<BR>
And play the shepherd more for sport than use.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The flesh of man he savoured more than sheep,<BR>
And this, before he reached the cave, was seen.<BR>
Three youths of ours, ere yet he climbed the steep,<BR>
He are alive, or rather swallowed clean;<BR>
Then moved the stone, which closed that cavern deep,<BR>
And lodged us there. With that, to pasture green<BR>
His flock he led, as wont, the meads among,<BR>
Sounding the pipe which at his neck was hung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Our lord, meanwhile, returning to the strand,<BR>
The loss which he had suffered comprehends;<BR>
For in deep silence, upon every hand,<BR>
Through empty tent and hut the monarch wends:<BR>
Nor who has robbed him can be understand;<BR>
And full of terror to the beach descends;<BR>
Whence he his sailors in the offing sees<BR>
Unmoor and spread their canvas to the breeze.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As soon as Norandino was in view,<BR>
They launched and sent their pinnace to convey<BR>
The monarch thence: but he no sooner knew<BR>
Of the fell orc, and those he made his prey,<BR>
Then he, without more thought, would him pursue<BR>
And follow, wheresoe&#8217;er he bent his way.<BR>
To lose Lucina is such cruel pain,<BR>
That life is loathsome save he her regain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When on the newly printed sand his eyes<BR>
Norandine fixt, he with the swiftness sped<BR>
With which the rage of love a man supplies,<BR>
Until he reached the cave of which I said,<BR>
Where we, enduring greater agonies<BR>
Than e&#8217;er were suffered, there await in dread<BR>
The orc, and deem at every sound we hear,<BR>
The famished brute about to re-appear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The monarch to the cave did Fortune guide,<BR>
When the orc&#8217;s wife alone was in the lair.<BR>
Seeing the king: &#8216;Fly!&#8212;Woe to thee!&#8217; (she cried)<BR>
&#8216;Should the orc take thee!&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;Woeful every where<BR>
I cannot choose but be,&#8217; (the king replied)<BR>
&#8216;Whether be take or miss me, kill or spare.<BR>
Not hither I by chance have wandered, I<BR>
Come with desire beside my wife to die.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He afterwards the dame for tidings pressed<BR>
Of those the orc had taken on the shore;<BR>
And of Lucina above all the rest;<BR>
If slain or prisoner kept. With kindly lore,<BR>
She Norandino, in return, addressed;<BR>
And said Lucina lived, nor need he more<BR>
Have of her future safety any dread,<BR>
For the orc on flesh of woman never fed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Of this you may behold the proof in me,<BR>
And all these other dames who with me dwell;<BR>
Nor me, nor them the orc offends, so we<BR>
Depart not ever from this caverned cell.<BR>
But vainly who would from her prison flee,<BR>
Hopes peace or pardon from our tyrant fell:<BR>
Buried alive, or bound with griding band,<BR>
Of, in the sun, stript naked on the sand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;When hither he to-day conveyed your crew,<BR>
The females from the males he severed not;<BR>
But, as he took them, in confusion threw<BR>
All he had captive made, into that grot.<BR>
He will scent out their sex; not tremble, you,<BR>
Lest he the women slay: the others&#8217; lot<BR>
Is fixt; and, of four men or six a-day,<BR>
Be sure the greedy orc will make his prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I have no counsel for you how to free<BR>
The lady; but content thyself to hear,<BR>
She in no danger of her life will be,<BR>
Who will our lot, in good or evil, share.<BR>
But go, for love of Heaven, my son, lest thee<BR>
The monster smell, and on thy body fare;<BR>
For when arrived, he sniffs about the house,<BR>
And, such his subtle scent, can wind a mouse.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To her the amorous monarch made reply,<BR>
That he the cave would not abandon, ere<BR>
He saw Lucina, and near her to die,<BR>
Than to live far from her, esteemed more dear.<BR>
&#8212;Seeing that she can nothing more supply<BR>
Fitted to shake the purpose of the peer,<BR>
Upon a new design the matron hits.<BR>
Pursued with all her pains, with all her wits.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With slaughtered sheep and goat was evermore<BR>
The cavern filled, the numerous flock&#8217;s increase,<BR>
Which served her and her household as a store;<BR>
And from the ceiling dangled many a fleece.<BR>
The dame made Norandino from a hoar<BR>
And huge he-goat&#8217;s fat bowels take the grease,<BR>
And with the suet all his members pay,<BR>
Until he drove his natural scent away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And when she thought he had imbibed the smell<BR>
Which the rank goat exhales, she took the hide,<BR>
And made him creep into the shaggy fell;<BR>
Who was well covered by that mantle wide.<BR>
Him in this strange disguise she from the cell<BR>
Crawling (for such was her command) did guide,<BR>
Where, prisoned by a stone, in her retreat,<BR>
Was hid his beauteous lady&#8217;s visage sweet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Kin Norandine, as bid, took up his ground<BR>
Before the cavern, on the greensward laid,<BR>
That he might enter with the flock who wound<BR>
Homeward; and longing sore, till evening stayed.<BR>
At eve he hears the hollow elder&#8217;s sound,<BR>
Upon whose pipes the wonted tune was played,<BR>
Calling his sheep from pasture to their rock,<BR>
By the fell swain who stalked behind his flock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Think if his heart is trembling at its core,<BR>
When Norandino hears the approaching strains;<BR>
And now advancing to the cavern door,<BR>
The sight of that terrific face sustains!<BR>
But if fear shook him, pity moved him more:<BR>
You see if he loves well or only feigns!<BR>
The orc removed the stone, unbarred the cote,<BR>
And the king entered, amid sheep and goat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His flock so housed, to us the orc descended,<BR>
But first had care the cavern door to close:<BR>
Then scented all about, and having ended<BR>
His quest, two wretches for his supper chose.<BR>
So is remembrance by this meal offended,<BR>
It makes me tremble yet: this done, he goes;<BR>
And being gone, the king his goatish vest<BR>
Casts off, and folds his lady to his breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whereas she him with pleasure should descry,<BR>
She, seeing him, but suffers grief and pain.<BR>
She sees him thither but arrived to die,<BR>
Who cannot hinder her from being slain.<BR>
&#8216;&#8201;&#8217;Twas no small joy &#8217;mid all the woes, that I,&#8217;<BR>
To him exclaimed Lucina, &#8216;here sustain.<BR>
That thou wert not among us found to-day,<BR>
When hither I was brought, the monster&#8217;s prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;For though to find myself about to leave<BR>
This life be bitter and afflict me sore,<BR>
Such is our common instinct, I should grieve<BR>
But for myself; but whether thee, before<BR>
Of after me, the orc of life bereave,<BR>
Assure thyself thy death will pain me more<BR>
Than mine.&#8217; And thus the dame persists to moan<BR>
More Norandino&#8217;s danger than her own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;A hope conducts me here,&#8217; the monarch said,<BR>
&#8216;To save thee and thy followers every one;<BR>
And, if I cannot, I were better dead,<BR>
Than living without light of thee, my sun!<BR>
I trust to scape, as hither I have spied;<BR>
As ye shall all, if, as ourselves have done,<BR>
To compass our design, you do not shrink<BR>
To imbue your bodies with the loathsome stink.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The trick he told, wherewith the monster&#8217;s smell<BR>
To cheat, as first to him the wife had told:<BR>
In any case to cloathe us in the fell,<BR>
That he may feel is issueing from the fold.<BR>
As many men as women in the cell,<BR>
We slay (persuaded by the monarch bold)<BR>
As many goats as with our number square,<BR>
Of those which stink the most and oldest are.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;We smeared our bodies with the fruitful grease<BR>
Which round about the fat intestines lay,<BR>
And cloathed our bodies with the shaggy fleece:<BR>
This while from golden dwelling broke the day.<BR>
And now, his flock returning to release,<BR>
We viewed the shepherd, with the dawning ray;<BR>
Who, giving breath to the sonorous reeds,<BR>
Piped forth his prisoned flock to hill and meads.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He held his hand before the opened lair,<BR>
Lest with the herd we issued from the den,<BR>
And stopt us short; but feeling wool or hair<BR>
Upon our bodies, let us go again.<BR>
By such a strange device we rescued were,<BR>
Cloathed in our shaggy fleeces, dames and men:<BR>
Nor any issuing thence the monster kept,<BR>
Till thither, sore alarmed, Lucina crept.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lucina&#8212;whether she abhorred the scent,<BR>
And, like us others, loathed herself to smear,<BR>
&#8212;Or whether with a slower gait she went<BR>
Than might like the pretended beast&#8217;s appear,<BR>
&#8212;Or whether, when the orc her body hent,<BR>
Her dread so mastered her, she screamed for fear,<BR>
&#8212;Or that her hair escaped from neck or brow,<BR>
Was known; nor can I well inform you how.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So were we all intent on our own case,<BR>
We for another&#8217;s danger had no eyes:<BR>
Him, turning at the scream. I saw uncase<BR>
Already her whom he had made his prize,<BR>
And force her to the cavern to retrace<BR>
Her steps: we, couching in our quaint disguise,<BR>
Wend with the flock, where us the shepherd leads,<BR>
Through verdant mountains, into pleasant meads.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;There we awaited, till beneath the shade<BR>
Secure, we saw the beaked orc asleep;<BR>
When one along the shore of ocean made,<BR>
And one betook him to the mountain steep.<BR>
King Norandine his love alone delayed;<BR>
Who would return disguised among the sheep,<BR>
Nor from the place depart, while life remained,<BR>
Unless his faithful consort he regained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For when before, on the flock issuing out,<BR>
He saw her prisoned in the cave alone,<BR>
Into the orc&#8217;s wide throat he was about<BR>
To spring; so grief had reason overthrown,<BR>
And he advanced even to the monster&#8217;s snout,<BR>
And, but by little, scaped the grinding stone:<BR>
Yet him the hope detained amid the flock,<BR>
Trusting to bear Lucina from the rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The orc, at eve, when to the cave again<BR>
He brings the herd, nor finds us in the stall,<BR>
And knows that he must supperless remain,<BR>
Lucina guilty of the whole does call,<BR>
Condemned to stand, fast girded with a chain,<BR>
In open air, upon the summit tall.<BR>
The king who caused her woes, with pitying eye<BR>
Looks on, and pines,&#8212;and only cannot die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Morning and evening, her, lamenting sore,<BR>
Ever the unhappy lover might survey;<BR>
What time he grieving went afield before<BR>
The issuing flock, or homeward took his way.<BR>
She, with sad face, and suppliant evermore,<BR>
Signed that for love of Heaven he would not stay;<BR>
Since there he tarried at great risk of life.<BR>
Nor could in any thing assist his wife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So the orc&#8217;s wife, as well upon her side,<BR>
Implored him to depart, but moved him nought;<BR>
To go without Lucina he denied,<BR>
And but remained more constant in his thought.<BR>
In this sad servitude he long was tried,<BR>
By Love and Pity bound: till Fortune brought<BR>
A pair of warriors to the rocky won,<BR>
Gradasso, and Agrican&#8217;s redoubted son:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Where, with their arms so wrought the champions brave,<BR>
They freed Lucina from the chains she wore,<BR>
(Though he Wit less than Fortune served in save)<BR>
And running to the sea their burden bore:<BR>
Her to her father, who was there, they gave.<BR>
This was at morn, when in the cavern hoar,<BR>
Mixt with the goats, king Norandino stood,<BR>
Which ruminating, chewed their grassy food:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But when, at day-light, &#8217;twas unbarred, and now<BR>
He was instructed that his wife was gone;<BR>
For the orc&#8217;s consort told the tale, and how,<BR>
In every point, the thing rehearsed was done;<BR>
He thanked his God, and begged, with promised vow,<BR>
That, since &#8217;twas granted her such ill to shun,<BR>
He would direct his wife to some repair,<BR>
Whence he might free her, by arms, gold, or prayer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Together with the flat-nosed herd his way<BR>
He took, and for green meads rejoicing made.<BR>
He here expected, till the monster lay<BR>
Extended, underneath the gloomy shade:<BR>
Then journeyed all the night and all the day;<BR>
Till, of the cruel orc no more afraid,<BR>
He climbed a bark on Satalia&#8217;s strand,<BR>
And, three days past, arrived on Syrian land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In Cyprus, and in Rhodes, by tower and town,<BR>
Which in near Egypt, Turkey, or Afric lay,<BR>
The king bade seek Lucina up and down,<BR>
Nor could hear news of her till the other day.<BR>
The other day, his father-in-law made known<BR>
He had her safe with him. What caused her stay<BR>
In Nicosia was a cruel gale<BR>
Which had long time been adverse to her sail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The king, for pleasure of the tidings true,<BR>
Prepares the costly feast in solemn state;<BR>
And will on each fourth moon that shall ensue<BR>
Make one, resembling this we celebrate.<BR>
Pleased of that time the memory to renew,<BR>
That he, in the orc&#8217;s cavern, had to wait,<BR>
&#8212;For four months and a day&#8212;which is to-morrow;<BR>
When he was rescued from such cruel sorrow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The things related I in part descried,<BR>
And from him, present at the whole, heard more;<BR>
From Norandine, through calend and through ide,<BR>
Pent, till he changed to smiles his anguish sore:<BR>
And if from other you hear aught beside,<BR>
Say, he is ill instructed in his lore.&#8221;<BR>
The Syrian gentleman did thus display<BR>
The occasion of that feast and fair array.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Large portion of the night, in like discourse,<BR>
Was by those cavaliers together spent,<BR>
Who deemed that Love and Pity&#8217;s mickle force<BR>
Was proved in that so dread experiment;<BR>
Then rising, when the supper&#8217;s sumptuous course<BR>
Was cleared, to good and pleasant lodgings went;<BR>
And, as the ensuing morning fairly broke,<BR>
To sounds of triumph and rejoicing woke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
The circling drums&#8217; and trumpets&#8217; echoing strain<BR>
Assemble all the town within the square;<BR>
And now, when mixt with sound of horse and wain,<BR>
Loud outcries through the streets repeated are,<BR>
Sir Gryphon dons his glittering arms again,<BR>
A panoply of those esteemed most rare;<BR>
Whose mail, impassable by spear or brand,<BR>
She, the white fay, had tempered with her hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
The man of Antioch in his company,<BR>
Armed him (a recreant worse than he was none),<BR>
Provided by their landlord&#8217;s courtesy<BR>
With sturdy spears and good, the course to run;<BR>
Who with his kindred, a fair chivalry,<BR>
To bring the warriors to the square is gone;<BR>
With squires afoot and mounted upon steeds,<BR>
Whom he bestowed, as aptest for their needs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
They in the square arrived and stood aside,<BR>
Nor of themselves awhile would make display;<BR>
Better to see the martial gallants ride<BR>
By twos and threes, or singly, to the fray.<BR>
One told, by colours cunningly allied,<BR>
His joy or sorrow to his lady gay;<BR>
One, with a painted Love on crest or shield,<BR>
If she were cruel or were kind, revealed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
It was the Syrians&#8217; practise in that age<BR>
To arm them in this fashion of the west.<BR>
Haply this sprung out of their vicinage<BR>
And constant commerce with the Franks, possest<BR>
In those days of the sacred heritage,<BR>
That God incarnate with his presence blest;<BR>
Which now, to them abandoned by the train<BR>
Of wretched Christians, heathen hounds profane.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
God&#8217;s worshippers, where they should couch the lance,<BR>
For furtherance of his holy faith and true,<BR>
Against each other&#8217;s breast the spear advance,<BR>
To the destruction of the faithful few.<BR>
You men of Spain, and you, ye men of France,<BR>
And Switzers, turn your steps elsewhere , and you,<BR>
Ye Germans, worthier empire to acquire;<BR>
For that is won for Christ, which you desire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
If verily most Christian you would be,<BR>
&#8212;I speak to you, that catholic are hight&#8212;<BR>
Why slain by you Christ&#8217;s people do I see?<BR>
Wherefore are they despoiled of their right?<BR>
Why seek you not Jerusalem to free<BR>
From renegades? By Turkish Moslemite<BR>
Impure, why is Byzantium, with the best<BR>
And fairest portion of the world, possest?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Thou Spain, hast thou not fruitful Afric nigh?<BR>
And has she not in sooth offended more<BR>
Than Italy? yet her to scathe, that high,<BR>
And noble, enterprize wilt thou give o&#8217;er.<BR>
Alas! thou sleepest, drunken Italy,<BR>
Of every vice and crime the fetid sewer!<BR>
Nor grievest, as a hand-maid, to obey,<BR>
In turn, the nations that have owned thy sway.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
If fear of famishing within thy cave,<BR>
Switzer, does thee to Lombardy convey,<BR>
And thou, among our people, dost but crave<BR>
A hand to give thee daily bread, or slay,&#8212;<BR>
The Turk has ready wealth; across the wave,<BR>
Drive him from Europe or from Greece away:<BR>
So shalt thou in those parts have wherewithal<BR>
To feed thy hunger, or more nobly fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
I to the German neighbour of thy lair<BR>
Say what I say to thee; the wealth o&#8217; the west,<BR>
Which Constantine brought off from Rome, is there&#8212;<BR>
Brought off the choicest, gave away the rest&#8212;<BR>
There golden Hermus and Pactolus are,<BR>
Mygdonia and Lydia: nor that country blest,<BR>
Which many tales for many praises note,<BR>
If thou wouldst thither wend, is too remote.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Thou mighty Lion, that art charged to keep<BR>
The keys of Paradise, a weighty care,<BR>
Oh! let not Italy lie plunged in sleep,<BR>
If thy strong hand is planted in her hair.<BR>
To thee, his shepherd, God, to guide his sheep,<BR>
Has given that wand and furious name to bear;<BR>
That thou may&#8217;st roar, and wide thine arms extend,<BR>
And so from greedy wolves thy flock defend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
But whither have I roved! who evermore<BR>
So from one topic to the other stray?<BR>
Yet think not I the road I kept before<BR>
To have missed so far, but I can find my way.<BR>
I said, the Syrians then observed the lore<BR>
Or arming like the Christians of that day.<BR>
So that Damascus&#8217; crowded square was bright<BR>
With corslet, plate, and helm of belted knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
The lovely ladies from their scaffolds throw<BR>
Upon the jousters yellow flowers and red;<BR>
While these, as loud the brazen trumpets blow,<BR>
Make their steeds leap and wheel and proudly tread.<BR>
Each, rode he well or ill, his art would show,<BR>
And with the goring spur his courser bled.<BR>
Hence this good cavalier earns fame and praise,<BR>
While others scornful hoots and laughter raise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
A suit of arms was prize of the assay,<BR>
Presented to the king some days before;<BR>
Which late a merchant found upon the way<BR>
Returning from Armenia; this the more<BR>
To grace, a vest, with noblest tissue gay,<BR>
The Syrian king subjoined, so powdered o&#8217;er<BR>
With jewels, gold, and pearls in rich device,<BR>
They made the meed a thing of passing price.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
If the good king had known the panoply,<BR>
This he had held above all others dear;<BR>
Nor this had given, as full of courtesy,<BR>
To be contented for with sword and spear.<BR>
&#8217;Twere long to tell who so unworthily<BR>
Had erst mistreated thus the goodly gear,<BR>
That lay the way the harness had been strowed,<BR>
A prey to whosoever past the road.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Of this you more in other place shall hear.<BR>
Of Gryphon now I tell, who at the just<BR>
Arrived, saw broken many a knightly spear,<BR>
And more than one good stroke and one good thrust.<BR>
Eight were there who made league together, dear<BR>
To Norandine, and held in sovereign trust;<BR>
Youths quick in arms and practised in the shock:<BR>
All lords, or scions of illustrious stock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
At open barriers, one by one, the place<BR>
They kept against all comers for a day;<BR>
At first with lance, and next with sword or mace,<BR>
While them the king delighted to survey.<BR>
Ofttimes they pierce the corslet&#8217;s iron case,<BR>
And every thing in fine perform in play,<BR>
Which foemen do that deadly weapons measure,<BR>
Save that the king may part them at his pleasure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
That witless Antiochite, who, worthily,<BR>
By name was cowardly Martano hight,<BR>
Thinking, because his comrade, he must be<BR>
Partaker of the noble Gryphon&#8217;s might,<BR>
Into the martial press rides valiantly,<BR>
Then stops; and the issue of a furious fight,<BR>
Which had begun between two cavaliers,<BR>
To wait, retiring from the strife, appears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Seleucia&#8217;s lord, of those companions one,<BR>
Combined in that emprize to keep the place,<BR>
Who then a course with bold Ombruno run,<BR>
Wounded the unhappy warrior in mid-face,<BR>
So that he slew him; mourned by every one,<BR>
Who as a worthy knight the warrior grace,<BR>
And over and above his worth, before<BR>
All others, hold him for his courteous lore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
When vile Martano from his place discerned<BR>
The fate which might be his with fearful eye,<BR>
Into his craven nature be returned,<BR>
And straight began to think how he might fly:<BR>
But him from flight the watchful Gryphon turned,<BR>
And, after much ado, with act and cry,<BR>
Urged him against a knight upon the ground,<BR>
As at the ravening wolf men slip the hound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Who will pursue the brindled beast for ten,<BR>
Or twenty yards, and, after, stop to bay;<BR>
When he beholds his flashing eyes, and when<BR>
He sees the griesly beast his teeth display.<BR>
&#8217;Twas thus, before those valiant gentlemen<BR>
And princes, present there in fair array,<BR>
Fearful Martano, seized with panic dread,<BR>
Turned to the right his courser&#8217;s rein and head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Yet he who would excuse the sudden wheel,<BR>
Upon his courser might the blame bestow:<BR>
But, after, he so ill his strokes did deal,<BR>
Demosthenes his cause might well forego.<BR>
With paper armed he seems, and not with steel,<BR>
So shrinks he at the wind of every blow:<BR>
At length he breaks the ordered champions through,<BR>
Amid loud laughter from the circling crew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Clapping of hands, and cries, at every turn,<BR>
Were heard from all that rubble widely spread.<BR>
As a wolf sorely hunted makes return<BR>
To earth, to his retreat Martano fled.<BR>
Gryphon remained, and sullied with the scorn<BR>
Esteemed himself, which on his mate was shed;<BR>
And rather than be there, he, in his ire,<BR>
Would gladly find himself i&#8217; the midst of fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
With burning heart, and visage red with shame,<BR>
He thinks the knight&#8217;s disgrace is all his own,<BR>
Because by deeds like his with whom he came,<BR>
He weens the mob expects to see him known.<BR>
So that it now behoves his valour flame<BR>
More clear than light, or they, to censure prone,<BR>
&#8212;Errs he a finger&#8217;s breadth&#8212;an inch&#8212;will swell<BR>
His fault, and of that inch will make an ell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Already he the lance upon his thigh<BR>
Has rested, little used to miss the foe:<BR>
Then makes with flowing rein his courser fly,<BR>
And next, somedeal advanced, directs the blow;<BR>
And, smiting, puts to the last agony<BR>
Sidonia&#8217;s youthful lord, by him laid low.<BR>
O&#8217;ercome with wonder each assistant rises,<BR>
Whom sore the unexpected deed surprises.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Gryphon returned, and did the weapon wield.<BR>
Whole and recovered, which he couched before,<BR>
And in three pieces broke it on the shield<BR>
Which bold Laodicea&#8217;s baron bore.<BR>
Thrice of four times about to press the field<BR>
He seemed, and lay along the crupper, sore<BR>
Astound; yet rose at length, unsheathed his blade,<BR>
Wheeled his good courser, and at Gryphon made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Gryphon, who in his saddle sees the peer<BR>
Advancing towards him, nor unseated by<BR>
The encounter, says: &#8220;The failure of the spear<BR>
In a few strokes the sabre shall supply;&#8221;<BR>
And on his temples smote a stroke so shear,<BR>
It seemed that it descended from the sky;<BR>
And matched it with another, and again<BR>
Another, till he stretched him on the plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Here two good brothers of Apamia were,<BR>
In tourney wont to have the upper hand:<BR>
Corimbo named and Thyrsis was the pair;<BR>
Both overturned by Gryphon on the land.<BR>
One at the encounter left his saddle bare,<BR>
On the other Gryphon used his trenchant brand:<BR>
This valiant knight, was, in the common trust,<BR>
Sure to obtain the honours of the just.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Bold Salinterno, mid the warlike train,<BR>
Was in the lists, vizier and marshal hight,<BR>
Who had the government of all that reign,<BR>
And was, withal, a puissant man of might:<BR>
The tourney&#8217;s prize he sees, with much disdain,<BR>
About to be borne off by foreign knight.<BR>
A lance he snatches, and to Gryphon cries,<BR>
And him with many menaces defies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
But he makes answer with a massy spear,<BR>
Out of ten others chosen as the best;<BR>
And levelling at the buckler of the peer,<BR>
For greater surety, pierces plate and breast.<BR>
&#8217;Twixt rib and rib, it bored the cavalier,<BR>
Issuing a palm behind. To all the rest,<BR>
The king excepted, welcome was the blow:<BR>
For each was greedy Salinterno&#8217;s foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Two of Damascus next Sir Gryphon sped,<BR>
Hermophilo and Carmondo. This, arraid<BR>
Under his flag, the king&#8217;s militia led;<BR>
That was as lord high admiral obeyed.<BR>
This lightly at the shock on earth was shed,<BR>
And that, reversed, upon the ground o&#8217;erlaid<BR>
By his weak horse, too feeble to withstand<BR>
Sir Gryphon&#8217;s mighty push and puissant hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Yet in the field remained Seleucia&#8217;s knight,<BR>
The best of all the other seven at need;<BR>
And one who well accompanied his might<BR>
With perfect armour and a gallant steed.<BR>
Both at the helmet, where it locks, take sight,<BR>
And with their spears to the encounter speed:<BR>
But Gryphon hardest smote, whose paynim foe<BR>
Lost his left stirrup, staggered by the blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
They cast the truncheons down, their coursers wheel,<BR>
And, full of daring, with drawn falchions close.<BR>
Sir Gryphon was the first a stroke to deal,<BR>
Which might have split an anvil; at the blow&#8217;s<BR>
Descent, the shield is splintered&#8212;bone and steel&#8212;<BR>
This had its lord mid thousand others chose;<BR>
And, but &#8217;twas double, and the coat as well,<BR>
The sword had cleft the thigh on which it fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
He of Seleucia at Sir Gryphon&#8217;s casque,<BR>
At the same time, so fell a blow addrest,<BR>
It would have rent and torn the iron mask,<BR>
Had it not been enchanted like the rest.<BR>
The paynim&#8217;s labour is a fruitless task,<BR>
Of arms so hard Sir Gryphon is possest;<BR>
Who has the foe&#8217;s already cleft and broke<BR>
In many parts, nor thrown away a stroke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
Each one might see how much Seleucia&#8217;s lord<BR>
Was overmatched by Gryphon, and that day,<BR>
The worsted men had perished by the sword,<BR>
Had not the monarch quickly stopt the fray.<BR>
To his guard king Norandino spake the word,<BR>
And bade them enter, and the duel stay:<BR>
They part the knight, whom they asunder bear,<BR>
And much the king is lauded for his care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
The eight, who had to keep the field pretended<BR>
From all the world, nor yet their part had done<BR>
On a sole knight,&#8212;their quarrel ill defended,&#8212;<BR>
Had vanished from the tilt-yard one by one.<BR>
The others, who with them should have contended,<BR>
Stood idle; for to answer them was none.<BR>
Since Gryphon had forestalled, in the debate,<BR>
What they should all have done against those eight;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
And, for such little time endured the play,<BR>
Less than an hour sufficed to finish all.<BR>
But Norandine, the pastime to delay,<BR>
And to continue it till even-fall,<BR>
Descending from his place, bade clear the way;<BR>
And the huge squad divided, at his call,<BR>
Into two troops, whom, ranked by blood and might,<BR>
The monarch formed, and marched for other fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
Sir Gryphon, during this, had made return<BR>
Homeward, with anger and with fury stung;<BR>
Less thinking of his honours that the scorn<BR>
Which on the vile Martano had been flung.<BR>
Hence, from himself the opprobrious shame to turn,<BR>
Martano now employs his lying tongue;<BR>
And she, the false and cunning courtezan,<BR>
Assists him in his scheme as best she can.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
Whether the youth believed the tale or no,<BR>
He the excuse received, like one discreet;<BR>
And deemed it best for them at once to go,<BR>
And secretly and silently retreat,<BR>
For fear, that if the populace should know<BR>
Martano base, they him might ill entreat.<BR>
So, by short ways and close, they quit the abode,<BR>
And issue from the gates upon their road.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
Sir Gryphon, was he or his horse foredone<BR>
With toil, or was it sleep his eyes down weighed,<BR>
Ere yet the troop beyond two miles had gone,<BR>
At the first inn upon the highway stayed.<BR>
He doffed his armour all, and morion,<BR>
And had the steeds of trappings disarrayed;<BR>
And next alone he to a chamber sped,<BR>
Locked himself in, undrest, and went to bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
No sooner he his head had rested there,<BR>
Than, with deep sleep opprest, he closed his eye:<BR>
So heavily, no badgers in their lair,<BR>
Or dormice, overcome with slumber, lie.<BR>
Martano and Origille, to take the air,<BR>
Entered this while a garden which was nigh;<BR>
And there the strangest fraud together bred,<BR>
Which ever entered into mortal head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
Martano schemed to take away the steed<BR>
And gear, in which Sir Gryphon had been dight,<BR>
And stand before the monarch, in the weed<BR>
Of him who had in joust so proved his might.<BR>
As he had shaped in thought, he did the deed:<BR>
He took away the warrior&#8217;s horse, more white<BR>
Than milk, his buckler, surcoat, arms, and crest;<BR>
In all Sir Gryphon&#8217;s knightly ensigns drest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
He, who was clad in trappings not his own,<BR>
Like the ass mantled in the lion&#8217;s hide,<BR>
As he expected, to the king, unknown,<BR>
Was called in place of Gryphon: when descried<BR>
Or Norandine, he rising from his throne,<BR>
Embraced and kissed, and placed him by his side:<BR>
Nor deems enough to praise and hold him dear,<BR>
But wills that all around his praise should hear:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
And bids them the sonorous metal blow,<BR>
Proclaiming him the conqueror of that day:<BR>
And round about loud voices, high and low,<BR>
The unworthy name throughout the lists convey.<BR>
He wills that, side by side, with him shall go<BR>
The knight, when homeward he shall take his way;<BR>
And him such favour shows, intent to please,<BR>
As might have honoured Mars or Hercules.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
Him lodgings fair he gave, wherein to dwell<BR>
At court; and she who with the peer did ride<BR>
Was honoured by the courteous king as well,<BR>
&#8212;False Origille,&#8212;with knight and page supplied.<BR>
But it is time that I of Gryphon tell;<BR>
Who unsuspecting, she, or wight beside,<BR>
Him would with treacherous stratagem deceive,<BR>
Had fallen asleep, nor ever waked till eve.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
When he how late it was, awaking, knew,<BR>
With speed he from the chamber did withdraw;<BR>
And hastened where he, with the other crew,<BR>
Left Origille and her false brother-in-law:<BR>
And when, nor these, nor, upon better view,<BR>
His armour nor his wonted clothes he saw,<BR>
Suspicious waxed; and more suspicion bred<BR>
The ensigns of his comrade left instead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
The host, arriving, him at full possest<BR>
Of every thing,&#8212;and how, in white array,<BR>
That warrior, with the lady and the rest,<BR>
Had to the city measured back their way.<BR>
By little and by little, Gryphon guessed<BR>
What love from him had hidden till that day;<BR>
And knew, to his great sorrow, in the other<BR>
Origille&#8217;s paramour, and not her brother.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
Now he lamenting for his folly stood,<BR>
That having heard the truths the pilgrim said,<BR>
He should have let her story change his mood,<BR>
Who him before so often had betrayed.<BR>
He might have venged himself, nor did:&#8212;now wou&#8217;d,<BR>
Too late, inflict the punishment delaid;<BR>
Constrained (a crying error!) in his need<BR>
To take that wily treachour&#8217;s arms and steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
He better would have gone like naked man,<BR>
Than braced the unworthy cuirass on his breast;<BR>
Or hastened the detested shield to span,<BR>
Or place upon his helm the scorned crest.<BR>
But of the lover, and that courtezan,<BR>
He, passion mastering reason, took the quest:<BR>
And bending to Damascus&#8217; gate his way,<BR>
Arrived an hour before the close of day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
On the left hand a castle richly dight<BR>
Stood nigh the gate, to which Sir Gryphon rode.<BR>
Besides, that it was strong and armed for fight,<BR>
Filled with rare chambers was the rich abode.<BR>
The first of Syria, king, and lord, and knight,<BR>
And lady, in a gentle group bestowed,<BR>
There in an open gallery fairly met,<BR>
Were at their glad and costly supper set.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
With the high tower the beauteous gallery, clear<BR>
Beyond the city-wall, projected out,<BR>
From whence might be discovered, far and near,<BR>
The spacious fields and different roads about.<BR>
When Gryphon now, in his opprobrious gear,<BR>
And arms, dishonoured by the rabble&#8217;s flout,<BR>
Makes, by ill fortune, to the gate resort,<BR>
He by the king is seen, and all his court;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
And, taken for the man whose crest he wears,<BR>
In dame and knight moves laughter, through the ring.<BR>
The vile Martano, as a man who shares<BR>
The royal grace, sits next below the king;<BR>
And next, she, whom her love so fitly pairs;<BR>
Whom Norandino gaily questioning.<BR>
Demands of them, who is the coward knight,<BR>
That of his honour makes so passing light;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
Who, after feat so base and foul, anew<BR>
Approaches, with such front and shameless cheer,<BR>
&#8212;And cries, &#8220;It seems a thing unheard, that you,<BR>
An excellent and worthy cavalier,<BR>
Should take this man for your companion, who<BR>
Has not in all our wide Levant his peer.<BR>
Did you with him for contrast-sake combine,<BR>
That so your valour might more brightly shine?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8212;But did not love for you my will restrain,<BR>
By the eternal gods, I truly swear,<BR>
He should endure such ignominious stain,<BR>
As I am wont to make his fellows share:<BR>
Him would I make of my long-nursed disdain<BR>
Of cowardice perpetual record bear.<BR>
To you, by whom he hither was conveyed,<BR>
If now unpunished, let his thanks be paid.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
That vessel of all filthy vices, he,<BR>
Made answer: &#8220;Mighty sir, I cannot say<BR>
Who is the stranger, that fell in with me<BR>
Journeying from Antioch hither, by the way:<BR>
But him I worthy of my company<BR>
Deemed, by his warlike semblance led astray.<BR>
I nothing of his deeds have heard or seen,<BR>
Save what ill feats to-day have witnessed been;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Which moved me so, it little lacked but I,<BR>
For punishment of his unworthy fear,<BR>
Had put him out of case again to ply,<BR>
In martial tournament, the sword or spear;<BR>
And, but in reverence to your majesty<BR>
And presence, I forbore by hand to rear,<BR>
Not for his sake:&#8212;nor by thy mercy showed<BR>
On him, as my companion on the road;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whose former fellowship appears a stain;<BR>
And ever &#8217;twill sit heavy at my heart,<BR>
If I, uninjured, see the wretch again<BR>
&#8217;Scape, to the scandal of the warlike art.<BR>
&#8217;Twere better he from tower, a worthy pain,<BR>
Were gibbeted, than suffered to depart:<BR>
Hung as a beacon for the coward&#8217;s gaze.<BR>
Such were a princely deed, and worthy praise.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
A voucher he in Origilla had,<BR>
Who well, without a sign, his purpose read.<BR>
&#8220;I deem not,&#8221; cried the king, &#8220;his works so bad,<BR>
That they should cost the stranger knight his head:<BR>
Enough that he again the people glad,<BR>
For penance of his weighty sin.&#8221; This said,<BR>
He quickly called a baron of his crew,<BR>
And him enjoined the deed he was to do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
With many armed men that baron fares,<BR>
And to the city-gate descending, here<BR>
Collects his troop, and for the attempt prepares,<BR>
Waiting the coming of the cavalier;<BR>
And him surprises so at unawares,<BR>
He, softly, &#8217;twixt two bridges, takes the peer;<BR>
And him detains, with mockery and scorn,<BR>
In a dark chamber, till returning morn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
The early sun had scarce his golden hair<BR>
Uplifted from his ancient nurse&#8217;s breast,<BR>
Beginning, upon Alpine regions bare,<BR>
To chase the shades and gild the mountain-crest,<BR>
When Martan&#8217;, fearing Gryphon might declare<BR>
His wrong, and to the king the truth attest,<BR>
Retorting upon him the slander cast,<BR>
Took leave, and thence upon his journey past.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
His ready wit a fit excuse supplies<BR>
Why he stays not, to see the recreant shown.<BR>
He is with other gifts, beside the prize,<BR>
Rewarded for the victory, not his own,<BR>
And letters patent, drawn in ample wise,<BR>
Wherein his lofty honours wide are blown.<BR>
Let him depart; I promise he shall meet<BR>
A guerdon worthy of his treacherous feat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
Gryphon is brought with shame into the square,<BR>
When it is fully thronged with gazing wight,<BR>
Whom they of cuirass and of helmet bare,<BR>
And leave in simple cassock, meanly dight;<BR>
And, as to slaughter he conducted were,<BR>
Place on a wain, conspicuous to the sight;<BR>
Harnessed to which two sluggish cows are seen,<BR>
Weary and weak, and with long hunger lean.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
Thronging about the ignoble car, appear<BR>
Brazen-faced boy and girl of evil fame,<BR>
Who, each in turn, will play the charioteer,<BR>
And all assail the knight with bitter blame.<BR>
The boys might be a cause of greater fear,<BR>
For, joined to mocks and mows, and words of shame,<BR>
The warrior they with volleyed stones would slay,<BR>
But that the wiser few their fury stay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
That which of his disgrace had been the ground,<BR>
Though no true evidence of guilt, his mail<BR>
And plate, are dragged in due dishonour round,<BR>
Suspended at the shameful waggon&#8217;s tail.<BR>
The wain is stopt, and to the trumpet&#8217;s sound,<BR>
Heralds, in front of a tribunal&#8217;s pale,<BR>
His shame, before his eyes, amid the crowd,<BR>
(Another&#8217;s evil deed) proclaim aloud.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
They take their prisoner thence, and so repair<BR>
In front of temple, dwelling-house, and store;<BR>
Nor any cruel name of mockery spare,<BR>
Nor leave unsaid a word of filthy lore;<BR>
And him at last without the city bear:<BR>
The foolish rabble, trusting evermore<BR>
Their thrall to banish to the sound of blows,<BR>
Who passing little of its prisoner knows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
The warrior&#8217;s gyves no sooner they undo,<BR>
And from their manacles free either hand,<BR>
Than Gryphon seizes shield and sword, and, through<BR>
The rabble, makes long furrows with his brand.<BR>
With pike and spear unfurnished was the crew,<BR>
Who without weapons came, a witless band.<BR>
The rest for other canto I suspend,<BR>
For, sir, &#8217;tis time this song should have an end.</TD></TR>
