<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
His prisoners to the Child the Danish peer<BR>
Consigns, who, homeward bound, are wrecked at sea;<BR>
By swimming he escapes, and a sincere<BR>
And faithful servant now of Christ is he.<BR>
Meanwhile bold Brandimart, and Olivier,<BR>
And Roland fiercely charge the hostile three.<BR>
Sobrino is left wounded in the strife;<BR>
Gradasso and Agramant deprived of life.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
The odour which well-fashioned bear or hair,<BR>
Of that which find and dainty raiment steeps<BR>
Of gentle stripling, or of damsel fair,<BR>
&#8212;Who often love awakens, as she weeps&#8212;<BR>
If it ooze forth and scent the ambient air,<BR>
And which for many a day its virtue keeps,<BR>
Well shows, by manifest effects and sure,<BR>
How perfect was its first perfume and pure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
The drink that to his cost good Icarus drew<BR>
Of yore his sun-burned sicklemen to cheer,<BR>
And which (&#8217;tis said) lured Celts and Boi through<BR>
Our Alpine hills, untouched by toil whilere,<BR>
Well shows that cordial was the draught, when new;<BR>
Since it preserves its virtue through the year.<BR>
The tree to which its wintry foliage cleaves,<BR>
Well shows that verdant were its spring tide leaves.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
The famous lineage, for so many years<BR>
Of courtesy the great and lasting light,<BR>
Which ever, brightening as it burns, appears<BR>
To shine and flame more clearly to the sight,<BR>
Well proves the sire of Este&#8217;s noble peers<BR>
Must, amid mortals, have shone forth as bright<BR>
In all fair gifts which raise men to the sky,<BR>
As the glad sun mid glittering orbs on high.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
As in his every other feat exprest,<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s valiant mind and courteous lore<BR>
Were showed by tokens clear and manifest,<BR>
And his high mindedness shone more and more;<BR>
&#8212;So toward the Dane those virtues stood confest,<BR>
With whom (as I rehearsed to you before)<BR>
He had belied his mighty strength and breath;<BR>
For pity loth to put that lord to death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
The Danish warrior was well certified,<BR>
No wish to slay him had the youthful knight,<BR>
Who spared him now, when open was his side;<BR>
Now, when so wearied he no more could smite.<BR>
When finally he knew, and plain descried<BR>
Rogero scrupled to put forth his might,<BR>
If with less vigour and less prowess steeled,<BR>
At least in courtesy he would not yield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Pardi, sir, make we peace;&#8221; (he said) &#8220;success<BR>
In this contention cannot fall to me&#8212;<BR>
Cannot be mine; for I myself confess<BR>
Conquered and captive to thy courtesy.&#8221;<BR>
To him Rogero answered, &#8220;And no less<BR>
I covet peace, than &#8217;tis desired by thee.<BR>
But this upon condition, that those seven<BR>
Are freed from bondage, and to me are given.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
With that he showed those seven whereof I spake,<BR>
Bound and with drooping heads, a sad array;<BR>
Adding, he must to him no hindrance make,<BR>
Who would those kings to Africa convey.<BR>
And Dudon thus allowed the Child to take<BR>
Those seven, and him allowed to bear away<BR>
A bark as well; what likes him best he chooses,<BR>
Amid those vessels, and for Africk looses.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
He looses bark and sail; and in bold wise<BR>
Trusting the fickle wind, to seaward stood.<BR>
At first on her due course the vessel flies,<BR>
And fills the pilot full of hardihood.<BR>
The beach retreats, and from the sailors&#8217; eyes<BR>
So fades, the sea appears a shoreless flood.<BR>
Upon the darkening of the day, the wind<BR>
Displays its fickle and perfidious kind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
It shifts from poop to beam, from beam to prow,<BR>
And even there short season doth remain:<BR>
The reeling ship confounds the pilot; now<BR>
Struck fore, now aft, now on her beam again.<BR>
Threatening the billows rise, with haughty brow,<BR>
And Neptune&#8217;s white herd lows above the main.<BR>
As many deaths appear to daunt that rout,<BR>
As waves which beat their troubled bark about.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Now blows the wind in front, and now in rear,<BR>
And drives this wave an-end, that other back;<BR>
Others the reeling vessel&#8217;s side o&#8217;erpeer;<BR>
And every billow threatens equal wrack.<BR>
The pilot sighs, confused and pale with fear;<BR>
Vainly he calls aloud to shift the tack,<BR>
To strike or jibe the yard; and with his hand,<BR>
Signs to the crew the thing he would command.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
But sound or signal little boots; the eye<BR>
Sees not amid the dim and rainy night;<BR>
The voice unheard ascends into the sky,&#8212;<BR>
The sky, which with a louder larum smite<BR>
The troubled sailors&#8217; universal cry,<BR>
And roar of waters, which together fight.<BR>
Unheard is every hest, above, below,<BR>
Starboard or larboard, upon poop or prow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
In the strained tackle sounds a hollow roar,<BR>
Wherein the struggling wind its fury breaks;<BR>
The forked lightning flashes evermore,<BR>
With fearful thunder heaven&#8217;s wide concave shakes.<BR>
One to the rudder runs, one grasps an oar;<BR>
Each to his several office him betakes.<BR>
One will make fast, another will let go;<BR>
Water into the water others throw.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Lo! howling horribly, the sounding blast,<BR>
Which Boreas in his sudden fury blows,<BR>
Scourges with tattered sail the reeling mast:<BR>
Almost as high as heaven the water flows:<BR>
The oars are broken; and so fell and fast<BR>
That tempest pelts, the prow to leeward goes;<BR>
And the ungoverned vessel&#8217;s battered side<BR>
Is undefended from the foaming tide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Fallen on her starboard side, on her beam ends,<BR>
About to turn keel uppermost, she lies.<BR>
Meanwhile, his soul to Heaven each recommends,<BR>
Surer than sure to sink, with piteous cries.<BR>
Scathe upon scathe malicious Fortune sends,<BR>
And when one woe is weathered, others rise.<BR>
O&#8217;erstrained, the vessel splits; and through her seams<BR>
In many a part the hostile water streams.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
A fierce assault and cruel coil doth keep<BR>
Upon all sides that wintry tempest fell.<BR>
Now to their sight so high the billows leap,<BR>
It seems that these to heaven above would swell;<BR>
Now, plunging with the wave, they sink so deep,<BR>
That they appear to spy the gulfs of hell.<BR>
Small hope there is or none: with faultering breath<BR>
They gaze upon inevitable death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
On a despiteous sea, that livelong night,<BR>
They drifted, as the wind in fury blew.<BR>
The furious wind that with the dawning light<BR>
Should have abated, gathered force anew.<BR>
Lo! a bare rock, ahead, appears in sight,<BR>
Which vainly would the wretched band eschew;<BR>
Whom towards that cliff, in their despite, impel<BR>
The raging tempest and the roaring swell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Three times and four the pale-faced pilot wrought<BR>
The tiller with a vigorous push to sway;<BR>
And for the bark a surer passage sought:<BR>
But the waves snapt and bore the helm away.<BR>
To lower, or ease the bellying canvas aught<BR>
The sailors had no power; nor time had they<BR>
To mend that ill, or counsel what was best;<BR>
For them too hard the mortal peril prest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Perceiving now that nothing can defend<BR>
Their bark from wreck on that rude rock and bare,<BR>
All to their private aims alone attend,<BR>
And only to preserve their life have care.<BR>
Who quickest can, into the skiff descend;<BR>
But in a thought so overcrowded are,<BR>
Through those so many who invade the boat,<BR>
That, gunwale-deep, she scarce remains afloat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Rogero, on beholding master, mate,<BR>
And men abandoning the ship with speed,<BR>
In doublet, as he is, sans mail and plate,<BR>
Hopes in the skiff, a refuge in that need:<BR>
But finds her overcharged with such a weight,<BR>
And afterwards so many more succeed,<BR>
That the o&#8217;erwhelming wave the pinnace drown,<BR>
And she with all her wretched freight goes down;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Goes down, and, foundering, drags with her whoe&#8217;er<BR>
Leaving the larger bark, on her relies.<BR>
Then doleful shrieks are heard, &#8217;mid sob and tear,<BR>
Calling for succour on unpitying skies:<BR>
But for short space that shrilling cry they rear;<BR>
For, swoln with rage and scorn, the waters rise,<BR>
And in a moment wholly stop the vent<BR>
Whence issues that sad clamour and lament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
One sinks outright, no more to reappear;<BR>
Some rise, and bounding with the billows go:<BR>
Their course, with head uplifted, others steer;<BR>
An arm, an unshod leg, those others show:<BR>
Rogero, who the tempest will not fear,<BR>
Springs upward to the surface from below;<BR>
And little distant sees that rock, in vain<BR>
Eschewed by him and his attendant train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Himself with hands and feet the warrior rows,<BR>
Hoping by force thereof to win the shore;<BR>
Breast boldly the importunate flood, and blows<BR>
With his unwearied breath the foam before.<BR>
Waxing meanwhile, the troubled water rose,<BR>
And from the rock the abandoned vessel bore;<BR>
Quitted of those unhappy men, who die<BR>
(So curst their lot) the death from which they fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Alas! for man&#8217;s deceitful thoughts and blind!<BR>
The ship escaped from wreck, where hope was none;<BR>
When master and when men their charge resigned,<BR>
And let the vessel without guidance run.<BR>
It would appear the wind has changed its mind,<BR>
On seeing all that sailed in her are gone;<BR>
And blows the vessel from those shallows free,<BR>
Through better course, into a safer sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
She, having drifted wildly with her guide,<BR>
Without him, made directly Africk&#8217;s strand,<BR>
Two or three miles of waste Biserta wide,<BR>
Upon the quarter facing Egypt&#8217;s land;<BR>
And, as the sea went down and the wind died,<BR>
Stood bedded in that weary waste of sand.<BR>
Now thither Roland roved, who paced the shore;<BR>
As I in other strain rehearsed before;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
And willing to discover if alone,<BR>
Laden, or light, the stranded vessel were,<BR>
He, Olivier, and Monodantes&#8217; son,<BR>
Aboard her in a shallow bark repair:<BR>
Beneath the hatchways they descend, but none<BR>
Of human kind they see; and only there<BR>
Find good Frontino, with the trenchant sword<BR>
And gallant armour of his youthful lord;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Who was so hurried in his hasty flight<BR>
He had not even time to take his sword;<BR>
To Orlando known; which, Balisardo hight,<BR>
Was his erewhile; the tale&#8217;s upon record,<BR>
And ye have read it all, as well I wite;<BR>
How Falerina lost it to that lord,<BR>
When waste as well her beauteous bowers he laid;<BR>
And how from him Brunello stole the blade;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
And how beneath Carena, on the plain<BR>
Brunello on Rogero this bestowed.<BR>
How matchless was that faulchion&#8217;s edge and grain,<BR>
To him experience had already showed;<BR>
I say, Orlando; who was therefore fain,<BR>
And to heaven&#8217;s king with grateful thanks o&#8217;erflowed;<BR>
And deemed, and often afterwards so said,<BR>
Heaven for such pressing need had sent the blade:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Such pressing need, in that he had to fight<BR>
With the redoubted king of Sericane;<BR>
And knew that he, besides his fearful might,<BR>
Was lord of Bayard and of Durindane.<BR>
Not knowing them, Anglantes&#8217; valiant knight<BR>
So highly rated not the plate and chain<BR>
As he that these had proved: they valour were,<BR>
But valued less as good than rich and fair;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
And, for of harness he had little need,<BR>
Charmed, and against all weapons fortified,<BR>
To Olivier he left the warlike weed:<BR>
Not so the sword; which to his waist he tied:<BR>
To Brandimart Orlando gave the steed:<BR>
Thus equally that spoil would he divide<BR>
With his companions twain, in equal share,<BR>
Who partners in that rich discovery were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Against the day of fight, in goodly gear<BR>
And new, those warriors seek their limbs to deck.<BR>
Blazoned upon Orlando&#8217;s shield appear<BR>
The burning bold and lofty Babel&#8217;s wreck.<BR>
A lyme-dog argent bears Sir Olivier,<BR>
Couchant, and with the leash upon his neck:<BR>
The motto; TILL HE COMES: In gilded vest<BR>
And worthy of himself he will be drest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Bold Brandimart designed upon the day<BR>
Of battle, for his royal father&#8217;s sake,<BR>
And his own honour, no device more gay<BR>
Than a dim surcoat to the field to take.<BR>
By gentle Flordelice for that dark array,<BR>
Was wrought the fairest facing she could make.<BR>
With costly jewels was the border sown;<BR>
Sable the vest, and of one piece alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
With her own hand the lady wrought that vest,<BR>
Becoming well the finest plate and chain,<BR>
Wherein the valiant warrior should be drest,<BR>
And cloak his courser&#8217;s croup and chest and mane:<BR>
But, from that day when she herself addrest<BR>
Unto this task, till ended was her pain,<BR>
She showed no sign of gladness; nor this while,<BR>
Nor after, was she ever seen to smile.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
The heartfelt fear, the torment evermore<BR>
Of losing Brandimart the dame pursued.<BR>
She him whilere a hundred times and more<BR>
Engaged in fierce and fearful fight had viewed;<BR>
Nor ever suchlike terror heretofore<BR>
Had blanched her cheek and froze her youthful blood;<BR>
And this new sense of fear increased her trouble,<BR>
And made the trembling lady&#8217;s heart beat double.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
The warriors to the wind their canvas rear,<BR>
When point device the three accoutred are.<BR>
Bold Sansonet is left, with England&#8217;s peer,<BR>
Intrusted with the faithful army&#8217;s care.<BR>
Flordelice, pricked at heart with cruel fear,<BR>
Filling the heavens with vow, lament and prayer,<BR>
As far as they by sight can followed be,<BR>
Follows their sails upon the foaming sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
Scarce, with much labour, the two captains led<BR>
Her, gazing on the waters, from the shore,<BR>
And to the palace drew, where on her bed<BR>
They left the lady, grieved and trembling sore.<BR>
Meanwhile upon their quest those others sped,<BR>
Whom mercy wind and weather seaward bore.<BR>
Their vessel made that island on the right;<BR>
The field appointed for so fell a fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Orlando disembarks, with his array,<BR>
His kinsman Olivier and Brandimart;<BR>
Who on the side which fronts the eastern ray,<BR>
Encamp them, and not haply without art.<BR>
King Agramant arrives that very day,<BR>
And tents him on the contrary part.<BR>
But for the sun is sinking fast, forborne<BR>
Is their encounter till the following morn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Until the skies the dawning light receive,<BR>
Armed servants keep their watch both there and here.<BR>
The valiant Brandimart resorts that eve<BR>
Thitherward, where their tents the paynims rear;<BR>
And parleys, by this noble leader&#8217;s leave,<BR>
With Agramant; for they were friends whilere;<BR>
And, underneath the banner of the Moor,<BR>
He into France had passed from Africk&#8217;s shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
After salutes, and joining hand with hand,<BR>
Fair reasons, as a friend, the faithful knight<BR>
Pressed on the leader of the paynim band<BR>
Why he should not the appointed battle fight;<BR>
And every town&#8212;restored to his command&#8212;<BR>
Laying &#8217;twixt Nile and Calpe&#8217;s rocky height,<BR>
Vowed he, with Roland&#8217;s license, should receive,<BR>
If upon Mary&#8217;s Son he would believe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
He said: &#8220;For loved you were, and are by me,<BR>
This counsel give I; that I deem it sane,<BR>
Since I pursue it, you assured must be:<BR>
Mahound I hold but as an idol vain;<BR>
In Jesus Christ, the living God I see,<BR>
And to conduct you in my way were fain;<BR>
I&#8217; the way of safety fain would have you move<BR>
With me and all those others that I love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In this consists your welfare; counsel none<BR>
Save this, in your disaster, can avail;<BR>
And, of all counsels least, good Milo&#8217;s son<BR>
To meet in combat, clad in plate and mail;<BR>
In that the profit, if the field be won,<BR>
Weighs not against the loss, in equal scale.<BR>
If you be conqueror, little gain ensues,<BR>
Yet little loss results not, if you lose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Were good Orlando and we others slain,<BR>
Banded with him to conquer or to die;<BR>
Wherefore, through this, ye should your lost domain<BR>
Acquire anew, forsooth, I see not, I;<BR>
Nor is there reason hope to entertain<BR>
That, if we lifeless on the champaigne lie,<BR>
Men should be wanting in King Charles&#8217;s host<BR>
To guard in Africa his paltriest post.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
Thus Brandimart to Afick&#8217;s cavalier;<BR>
And much would have subjoined; but, on his side,<BR>
That knight, with angry voice and haughty cheer,<BR>
The pagan interrupted, and replied:<BR>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis sure temerity and madness sheer<BR>
Moves you and whatsoever wight beside,<BR>
That counsels matter, be it good or ill,<BR>
Uncalled a counsellor&#8217;s duty to fulfil;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And how to think, from love those counsels flow<BR>
Which once you bore and bear me, as you say,<BR>
(To speak the very truth) I do not know,<BR>
Who with Orlando see you here, this day.<BR>
I ween that, knowing you are doomed to woe,<BR>
And marked for the devouring dragon&#8217;s prey,<BR>
Ye all mankind would drag to nether hell,<BR>
In your eternity of pains to dwell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If I shall win or lose, remount my throne,<BR>
Or pass my future days in exile drear,<BR>
God only knows, whose purpose is unknown<BR>
To me, in turn, or to Anglantes&#8217; peer.<BR>
Befall what may, by me shall nought be done<BR>
Unworthy of a king, through shameful fear.<BR>
If death must be my certain portion, I,<BR>
Rather than wrong my princely blood, will die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ye may depart, who, save ye better play<BR>
The warrior, in to-morrow&#8217;s listed fight,<BR>
Then ye have plaid the embassador to-day,<BR>
In arms will second ill Anglantes&#8217; knight.&#8221;<BR>
Agramant ended so his furious say;<BR>
&#8212;His angry bosom boiling with despite.<BR>
So said&#8212;the warriors parted, to repose,<BR>
Till from the neighbouring sea the day arose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
When the first whitening of the dawn was seen,<BR>
Armed, in a moment leapt on horseback all;<BR>
Short parley past the puissant foes between.<BR>
There was no stop; there was no interval;<BR>
For they have laid in rest their lances keen:<BR>
But I into too foul a fault should fall<BR>
Meseems, my lord, if, while their deeds I tell<BR>
I let Rogero perish in the swell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
Cleaving the flood with nimble hands and feet<BR>
He swims, amid the horrid surges&#8217; roar,<BR>
On him the threatening wind and tempest beat,<BR>
But him his harassed conscience vexes more.<BR>
Christ&#8217;s wrath he fears; and, since in waters sweet<BR>
(When time and fair occasion served of yore)<BR>
He, in his folly, baptism little prized,<BR>
Fears in these bitter waves to be baptized.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Those many promises remembered are<BR>
Whereby he to his lady-love was tied,<BR>
Those oaths which sworn to good Rinaldo were,<BR>
And were in nought fulfilled upon his side.<BR>
To God, in hope that he would hear and spare,<BR>
That he repented, oftentimes he cried,<BR>
And, should he land, and scape that mortal scaith,<BR>
To be a Christian, vowed in heart and faith;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
And ne&#8217;er, in succour of the Moorish train,<BR>
With sword or lance, the faithful to offend;<BR>
And into France, where he to Charlemagne<BR>
Would render honour due, forthwith to wend;<BR>
Nor Bradamant with idle words again<BR>
To cheat, but bring his love to honest end.<BR>
A miracle it is that, as he vows,<BR>
He swims more lightly and his vigour grows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
His vigour grows; unwearied is his mind;<BR>
And still his arms from him the billow throw,<BR>
This billow followed fast by that behind;<BR>
Whereof one lifts him high, one sinks him low.<BR>
Rising and falling, vext by wave and wind,<BR>
So gains the Child that shore with labour slow;<BR>
And where the rocky hill slopes seaward most,<BR>
All drenched and dropping, climbs the rugged coast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
All the others that had plunged into the flood<BR>
In the end, o&#8217;erwhelmed by those wild waters died.<BR>
Rogero, as to Providence seemed good,<BR>
Mounted the solitary islet&#8217;s side.<BR>
When safe upon the barren rock he stood,<BR>
A new alarm the stripling terrified;<BR>
To be within those narrow bounds confined,<BR>
And die, with hardship and with hunger pined.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Yet he with an unconquered heart, intent<BR>
To suffer what the heavens for him ordained,<BR>
O&#8217;er those hard stones, against that steep ascent,<BR>
Towards the top with feet intrepid strained;<BR>
And not a hundred yards had gone, when, bent<BR>
With years, and with long fast and vigil stained,<BR>
He worthy of much worship one espied,<BR>
In hermit&#8217;s weed, descend the mountain&#8217;s side;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Who cries, on his approaching him, &#8220;Saul, Saul,<BR>
Why persecutest thou my faithful seed?&#8221;<BR>
As whilom said the Saviour to Saint Paul,<BR>
When (blessed stroke!) he smote him from his steed.<BR>
&#8220;Thou thought&#8217;st to pass the sea, nor pay withal;<BR>
Thought&#8217;st to defraud the pilot of his meed.<BR>
Thou seest that God has arms to reach and smite,<BR>
When farthest off thou deem&#8217;st that God of might.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
And he, that holiest anchoret, pursued,<BR>
To whom the night foregoing God did send<BR>
A vision, as he slumbered, and foreshewed<BR>
How, thither by his aid the Child should wend;<BR>
Wherein his past and future life, reviewed,<BR>
Were seen, as well as his unhappy end;<BR>
And sons, and grandsons, and his every heir,<BR>
Fully revealed to that good hermit were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
That anchoret pursues, and does upbraid<BR>
Rogero first, and comforts finally:<BR>
Upbraideth him, because he had delaid<BR>
Beneath that easy yoke to bend the knee;<BR>
And what he should have done, when whilom prayed<BR>
And called of Christ&#8212;then uncompelled and free&#8212;<BR>
Had done with little grace; nor turned to God<BR>
Until he saw him threatening with the rod.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Then comforts him&#8212;that Christ aye heaven allows<BR>
To them, that late or early heaven desire;<BR>
And all those labourers of the Gospel shows,<BR>
Paid by the vineyard&#8217;s lord with equal hire.<BR>
With charity and warm devotion glows,<BR>
And him instructs the venerable sire,<BR>
As toward the rocky cell where he resides<BR>
He with weak steps and slow Rogero guides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Above that hallowed cell, on the hill&#8217;s brow,<BR>
A little church receives the rising day;<BR>
Commodious is the fane and fair enow;<BR>
Thence to the beach descends a thicket gray,<BR>
Where fertile and fruit-bearing palm-trees blow,<BR>
Myrtle, and lowly juniper, and bay,<BR>
Evermore threaded by a limpid fountain,<BR>
Which falls with ceaseless murmur from the mountain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas well nigh forty years, since on that stone<BR>
The goodly friar had fixed his quiet seat;<BR>
Which, there to live a holy life, alone,<BR>
For him the Saviour chose, as harbourage meet.<BR>
Pure water was his drink, and, plucked from one,<BR>
Or the other plant, wild berries were his meat;<BR>
And hearty and robust, of ailments clear,<BR>
The holy man had reached his eightieth year.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
That hermit lit a fire, and heaped the board<BR>
With different fruits, within his small repair;<BR>
Wherewith the Child somedeal his strength restored,<BR>
When he had dried his clothes and dripping hair.<BR>
After, at better ease, to him God&#8217;s word<BR>
And mysteries of our faith expounded were;<BR>
And the day following, in his fountain clear,<BR>
That anchoret baptized the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
There dwells the young Rogero, well content<BR>
With what the rugged sojourn does allow;<BR>
In that the friar showed shortly his intent<BR>
To send him where he fain would turn his prow.<BR>
Meanwhile with him he many an argument<BR>
Handles and often; of God&#8217;s kingdom now;<BR>
Now of things appertaining to his case;<BR>
Now to Rogero&#8217;s blood, a future race.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
The Lord, that every thing doth see and hear,<BR>
Had to that holiest anchoret bewrayed,<BR>
How he should not exceed the seventh year,<BR>
Dating from when he was a Christian made;<BR>
Who for the death of Pinabel whilere,<BR>
(His lady&#8217;s deed, but on Rogero laid)<BR>
As well as Bertolagi&#8217;s, should be slain<BR>
By false Maganza&#8217;s ill and impious train;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
And, how that treason should be smothered so,<BR>
No sign thereof should outwardly appear;<BR>
For where that evil people dealt the blow,<BR>
They should entomb the youthful cavalier.<BR>
For this should vengeance follow, albeit slow,<BR>
Dealt by his consort and his sister dear;<BR>
And how he by his wife should long be sought,<BR>
With weary womb, with heavy burden fraught,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twixt Brenta and Athesis, beneath those hills<BR>
(Which erst the good Antenor so contented,<BR>
With their sulphureous veins and liquid rills,<BR>
And mead, and field, with furrows glad indented,<BR>
That he for these left pools which Xanthus fills;<BR>
And Ida, and Ascanius long lamented,)<BR>
Till she a child should in the forests bear,<BR>
Which little distant from Ateste are;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
And how the Child, in might and beauty grown,<BR>
That, like his sire, Rogero shall be hight,<BR>
Those Trojans, as of Trojan lineage known,<BR>
Shall for their lord elect with solemn rite;<BR>
Who next by Charles (in succour of whose crown<BR>
Against the Lombards shall the stripling fight)<BR>
Of that fair land dominion shall obtain,<BR>
And the honoured title of a marquis gain;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
And because Charles shall say in Latin &#8216;Este&#8217;,<BR>
(That is&#8212;be lords of the dominion round!)<BR>
Entitled in a future season Este<BR>
Shall with good omen be that beauteous ground;<BR>
And thus its ancient title of Ateste<BR>
Shall of its two first letters lose the sound.<BR>
God also to his servant had foresaid<BR>
The vengeance taken for Rogero&#8217;s dead;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Who shall, in vision, to his consort true<BR>
Appear somedeal before the dawn of day;<BR>
And shall relate how him the traitor slew,<BR>
And where his body lies to her shall say.<BR>
She and Marphisa hence, those valiant two,<BR>
With fire and sword on earth shall Poictiers lay;<BR>
Nor shall his son, when of befitting age,<BR>
Less harm Maganza in his mighty rage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
On Azos, Alberts, Obysons, did dwell<BR>
That hermit hoar, and on their offspring bright;<BR>
Or Borso, Nicholas, and Leonel,<BR>
Alphonso, Hercules, and Hippolyte,<BR>
And. last of those, the gentle Isabel;<BR>
Then curbs his tongue and will no more recite.<BR>
He to Rogero what is fit reveals,<BR>
And what is fitting to conceal, conceals.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile Orlando and bold Brandimart,<BR>
With that good knight, the Marquis Olivier,<BR>
Against the paynim Mars together start;<BR>
(Name well befitting Sericana&#8217;s peer)<BR>
And the other two&#8212;that from the adverse part,<BR>
At more than a foot-pace their coursers steer;<BR>
I say King Agramant and King Sobrine:<BR>
The pebbly beach resounds, and rolling brine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
When they encounter in mid field, pell-mell,<BR>
And to the sky flew every shivered lance,<BR>
At that loud noise, the sea was seen to swell,<BR>
At that loud noise, which echoed even to France.<BR>
Gradasso and Roland met as it befel;<BR>
And fairly balanced might appear the chance,<BR>
But for the vantage of Rinaldo&#8217;s horse;<BR>
Which made Gradasso seem of greater force.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Bayardo shocked the steed of lesser might,<BR>
Backed by Orlando, with such might and main,<BR>
He made that courser stagger, left and right,<BR>
And measure next his length upon the plain:<BR>
Vainly to raise him strove Anglantes&#8217; knight,<BR>
Thrice, nay four times, with rowels and with rein;<BR>
Balked of his end, he lights upon the field,<BR>
Draws Balisarda, and uplifts his shield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
With Agramant encounters Olivier,<BR>
Who, fitly matched, their foaming coursers gall.<BR>
Bold Brandimart unhorsed in the career<BR>
Sobrino; but it was not plain withal<BR>
If &#8217;twas the fault of horse or cavalier;<BR>
For seldom good Sobrino used to fall.<BR>
Was it his courser&#8217;s or his own misdeed,<BR>
Sobrino found himself without a steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Now Brandimart, that upon earth descried<BR>
The king Sobrine, assailed no more his man;<BR>
But at Gradasso, who Anglantes&#8217; pride<BR>
Had equally unhorsed, in fury ran.<BR>
On Agramant and Oliviero&#8217;s side,<BR>
Meanwhile the warfare stood as it began:<BR>
When broken on their bucklers were the spears,<BR>
With swords encountered the returning peers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Roland who saw Gradasso in such guise,<BR>
As showed that to return he little cared,<BR>
&#8212;Nor can return; so Brandimart aye plies,<BR>
And presses Sericana&#8217;s monarch hard,<BR>
Turns round, and, like himself, afoot descries<BR>
Sobrino, in the doubtful strife unpaired:<BR>
At him he sprang; and, at his haughty look,<BR>
Heaven, as the warrior trod, in terror shook.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Foreseeing the assault with wary eye,<BR>
Prepared, and at close ward, behold the Moor!<BR>
As pilot against whom, now cresting nigh,<BR>
The threatening billow comes with hollow roar,<BR>
Towards it turns his prow, and, when so high<BR>
He views the sea, would gladly be ashore.<BR>
Sobrino rears his buckler, to withstand<BR>
The furious fall of Falerina&#8217;s brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Of such fine steel was Balisarda&#8217;s blade,<BR>
That arms against it little shelter were;<BR>
And by a person of such puissance swayed,<BR>
By Roland, singe in the world or rare,<BR>
It splits the shield, and is in nowise stayed,<BR>
Though bound about with steel the edges are:<BR>
It splits the shield, and to the bottom rends,<BR>
And on the shoulder underneath descends.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Upon the shoulder; nor, though twisted chain<BR>
And double plates encase the paynim foe,<BR>
These hinder much that sword of stubborn grain<BR>
From opening wide the parted flesh below.<BR>
Sobrino at Orlando smites; but vain<BR>
Against the valiant count is every blow;<BR>
To whom, for special grace, the King of heaven<BR>
A body charmed against all arms had given.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
The valorous count, redoubling still his blows,<BR>
Thought from the trunk the monarch&#8217;s head to smite.<BR>
Sobrino, who the strength of Clermont knows,<BR>
And how the shield ill boots, retired from fight,<BR>
Yet not so far, but that upon his brows<BR>
Fell the dread faulchion of Anglantes&#8217; knight:<BR>
&#8217;Twas on its flat, but such his might and main,<BR>
It crushed the helm and stupefied the brain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Stunned by that furious stroke, he pressed the shore,<BR>
And it was long ere he again did rise.<BR>
The paladin believes the warfare o&#8217;er,<BR>
And that deprived of life Sobrino lies;<BR>
And, lest Gradasso to ill pass and sore<BR>
Should bring Sir Brandimart, at him he flies:<BR>
For him the paynim overmatched in horse,<BR>
In arms and faulchion, and perhaps in force.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Bold Brandimart, who guides Frontino&#8217;s rein,<BR>
The goodly courser, erst Rogero&#8217;s steed,<BR>
So well contends with him of Sericane,<BR>
The king yet little seems his foe to exceed;<BR>
Who, if he had as tempered plate and chain<BR>
As that bold paynim lord, would better speed;<BR>
But (for he felt himself ill-armed) the knight<BR>
Often gave ground, and traversed left and right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Better than good Frontino horse is none<BR>
To obey upon a sign the cavalier;<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem that courser had the sense to shun<BR>
Sharp Durindana&#8217;s fall, now there now here.<BR>
Meanwhile elsewhere is horrid battle done<BR>
By royal Agramant and Olivier;<BR>
Who may be deemed well matched in warlike sleight,<BR>
Nor champions differing much in martial might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Orlando had left Sobrino (as I said)<BR>
On earth, and against Sericana&#8217;s pride,<BR>
Desirous valiant Brandimart to aid,<BR>
Even as he was, afoot, in fury hied:<BR>
When, prompt to assail Gradasso with the blade,<BR>
He, loose and walking in mid field, espied<BR>
The goodly horse, which had Sobrino thrown;<BR>
And bowned him straight to make the steed his own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
He seized the horse (for none the deed gainsaid)<BR>
And took a leap, and vaulted on his prize.<BR>
This hand the bridle grasped, and that the blade.<BR>
Orlando&#8217;s motions good Gradasso spies;<BR>
Nor at his coming is the king dismaid;<BR>
Who by his name the paladin defies:<BR>
With him, and both his partners in the fight,<BR>
He hopes to make it dark before &#8217;tis night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Leaving his foe, he, facing Brava&#8217;s lord,<BR>
Thrust at the collar of his shirt of mail,<BR>
All else beside the flesh the faulchion bored;<BR>
To pierce through which would every labour fail.<BR>
At the same time descends Orlando&#8217;s sword,<BR>
(Where Balisarda bites no spells avail)<BR>
Shears helmet, cuirass, shield, and all below,<BR>
And cleaves whate&#8217;er it rakes with headlong blow;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
And in face, bosom, and in thigh it seamed,<BR>
Beneath his mail, the king of Sericane.<BR>
From whom his blood till how had never streamed<BR>
Since he that armour wore; new rage and pain<BR>
Thereat the warrior felt, and strange it seemed<BR>
Sword cut so now, nor yet was Durindane.<BR>
Had Roland struck more home, or nearer been,<BR>
From head to belly he had cleft him clean.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
No more in arms can trust the cavalier<BR>
As heretofore; for proved those arms have been:<BR>
He with more care, more caution than whilere,<BR>
Prepares to parry with the faulchion keen.<BR>
When entered Brandimart sees Brava&#8217;s peer,<BR>
Who snatched that battle from him, he between<BR>
Those other conflicts placed himself, that where<BR>
It most was needed, he might succour bear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
While so the fight is balanced &#8217;mid those foes,<BR>
Sobrino, that on earth long time had lain,<BR>
When to himself he was returned, uprose,<BR>
In face and shoulder suffering grievous pain.<BR>
He lifts his face, his eyes about him throws;<BR>
And thither, where more distant on the plain<BR>
He sees his leader, with long paces steers<BR>
So stealthily, that none his coming hears;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
He on the Marquis came, who had but eyes<BR>
For Agramant, and in the warrior&#8217;s rear,<BR>
Wounded upon the hocks in such fierce wise<BR>
The courser of unheeding Olivier,<BR>
That he falls headlong; and beneath him lies<BR>
His valiant master, nor his foot can clear;<BR>
His left foot, which in that unthought for woe,<BR>
Was in the stirrup jammed, his steed below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Sorbine pursued, and with back-handed blow<BR>
Thought he his head should from his neck have shorn;<BR>
But this forbids that armour, bright of show,<BR>
By Vulcan hammered, and by Hector worn.<BR>
Brandimart sees his risque, and at the foe<BR>
Is by his steed, with flowing bridle, borne.<BR>
Sobrino on the head he smote and flung;<BR>
But straight from earth that fierce old man upsprung;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
And turned anew to Olivier, to speed<BR>
The warrior&#8217;s soul more promptly on its way;<BR>
Or at the least that baron to impede.<BR>
And him beneath his courser keep at bay:<BR>
Bold Olivier, whose better arm was freed,<BR>
And with his sword could fend him as he lay,<BR>
Meanwhile so smites and longes, there and here,<BR>
That at sword&#8217;s length he holds the ancient peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
He hopes, if him but little he withstood,<BR>
He shall be straight delivered from that pain:<BR>
He sees him wholly strained and wet with blood,<BR>
And that he spills so much from open vein,<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem he speedily must be subdued,<BR>
So weak he hardly can himself sustain.<BR>
Often and oft to rise the Marquis strove,<BR>
Yet could not from beneath his courser move.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Brandimart has found out the royal Moor,<BR>
And storms about that paynim cavalier;<BR>
Upon Frontino, like a lathe, before,<BR>
Beside, or whirling in the warrior&#8217;s rear.<BR>
A goodly horse the Christian champion bore;<BR>
Nor worse the southern king&#8217;s in the career:<BR>
That Brigliador, Rogero&#8217;s gift he crost,<BR>
Erewhile, by haughty Mandricardo lost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
Great vantage has he, on another part:<BR>
Of proof and perfect is his iron weed.<BR>
His at a venture took Sir Brandimart,<BR>
As he could have in haste in suchlike need;<BR>
But hopes (his anger puts him so in heart)<BR>
To change it for a better coat with speech;<BR>
Albeit the Moorish king, with bitter blow,<BR>
Has made the blood from his right should flow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Him in the flank Gradasso too had gored;<BR>
(Nor this was laughing matter) so had scanned<BR>
His vantage that redoubted paynim lord,<BR>
He found a place wherein to plant his brand;<BR>
He broke the warrior&#8217;s shield, his left arm bored,<BR>
And touched him slightly in the better hand.<BR>
But this was play, was pastime (might be said),<BR>
With Roland&#8217;s and Gradasso&#8217;s battle weighed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Gradasso has Orlando half disarmed;<BR>
Atop and on both sides his helm has broke:<BR>
Fallen is his shield, his cuirass split; but harmed<BR>
The warrior is not by the furious stroke,<BR>
Which opened plate and mail; for he is charmed;<BR>
And worser vengeance on the king has wroke,<BR>
In face, throat, breast has gored that cavalier,<BR>
Beside the wounds whereof I spake whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Gradasso, desperate when he descried<BR>
Himself all wet, and smeared with sanguine dye,<BR>
And Roland, all from head to foot espied,<BR>
After such mighty strokes unstained and dry,<BR>
Thinking head, breast, and belly to divide,<BR>
With both his hands upheaved his sword on high;<BR>
And, even as he devised, upon the front,<BR>
Smote with mid blade Anglantes&#8217; haughty count.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
And would by any other so have done;<BR>
&#8212;Would to the saddle-tree have cleft him clean:<BR>
But the good sword, as if it fell upon<BR>
Its flat, rebounds again, unstained and sheen.<BR>
The furious stroke astounded Milo&#8217;s son<BR>
By whom some scattered stars on earth were seen.<BR>
He drops the bridle and would drop the brand,<BR>
But that a chain secures it to his hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
So by the noise was scared the horse that bore<BR>
Upon his back Anglantes&#8217; cavalier.<BR>
The courser scowered about the powdery shore,<BR>
Showing how good his speed in the career:<BR>
The County by that stroke astounded sore,<BR>
Has not the power the frightened horse to steer.<BR>
Gradasso follows and will reach him, so<BR>
That he but little more pursues the foe;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
But turning round, beholds the royal Moor<BR>
To the utmost peril in that battle brought;<BR>
For by the shining helmet which he wore,<BR>
With the left hand, him Brandimart had caught;<BR>
Already had unlaced the casque before,<BR>
And with his dagger would new ill have wrought:<BR>
Nor much defence could make the Moorish lord;<BR>
For Brandimart as well had reft his sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Gradasso turned, nor more Orlando sought,<BR>
But hastened where he Agramant espied:<BR>
The incautious Brandimart, suspecting nought<BR>
Orlando would have let him turn aside,<BR>
Had not Gradasso in his eyes or thought,<BR>
And to the paynim&#8217;s throat his knife applied.<BR>
Gradasso came, and at his helmet layed,<BR>
Wielding with either hand his trenchant blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Father of heaven! &#8217;mid spirits chosen by thee,<BR>
To him thy martyr true, a place accord;<BR>
Who, having traversed his tempestuous sea,<BR>
Now furls his sails in port. Ah! ruthless sword,<BR>
So cruel, Durindana, can&#8217;st thou be,<BR>
To good Orlando, to thine ancient lord,<BR>
That thou can&#8217;st slaughter, in the warrior&#8217;s view,<BR>
Of all his friends the dearest and most true?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
An iron ring that girt his helmet round,<BR>
Two inches thick, was broke by that fell blow<BR>
And cleft; and with the solid iron bound,<BR>
Was parted the good cap of steel below,<BR>
Bold Brandimart, reversed upon the ground,<BR>
With haggard face beside his horse lies low;<BR>
And issuing widely from the warrior&#8217;s head<BR>
A stream of life-blood dyes the shingle red.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
Come to himself, the County turns his eye<BR>
And sees his Brandimart upon the plain,<BR>
And in such act Gradasso standing by<BR>
As clearly shows by whom the knight was slain.<BR>
If he most raged or grieved I know not, I,<BR>
But such short time is left him to complain,<BR>
His hasty wrath breaks forth, his grief gives way;<BR>
But now &#8217;tis time that I suspend my lay.</TD></TR>
