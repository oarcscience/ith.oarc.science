<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
To Arles the Child, to Charles Marphisa wends,<BR>
To be baptized, with Bradamant for guide.<BR>
Astolpho from the holy realm descends;<BR>
Through whom with sight the Nubian is supplied:<BR>
Agramant&#8217;s land he with his troop offends;<BR>
But he is of his Africk realm so wide,<BR>
With Charles he bargains, that, on either side,<BR>
Two knights by strife their quarrel should decide.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Ye courteous ladies, who unto my strain<BR>
Kind audience lend&#8212;I read it in your cheer&#8212;<BR>
That good Rogero should depart again<BR>
So suddenly, from her that held him dear,<BR>
Displeases ye, and scarce inflicts less pain<BR>
Than that which Bradamant endured whilere:<BR>
I read you also argue, to his shame,<BR>
That feebly burned in him the amorous flame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
If from her side for other cause had gone,<BR>
Against that lady&#8217;s will, the youthful lord;<BR>
Though in the hope more treasure to have won<BR>
Than swelled rich Croesus&#8217; or rich Crassus&#8217; hoard,<BR>
I too should deem the dart, by Cupid thrown,<BR>
Had not the heart-core of Rogero gored.<BR>
For such a sovereign joy, a prize so high<BR>
No silver and no gold could ever buy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Yet to preserve our honour not alone<BR>
Deserves excuse, it also merits praise:<BR>
This to preserve, I say, when to have done<BR>
In other wise, might shame and scandal raise;<BR>
And had fair Bradamant reluctance shown,<BR>
And obstinately interposed delays,<BR>
This, as a certain sign, had served to prove<BR>
That lady&#8217;s little wit or little love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
For if his life, whom gentle woman loves,<BR>
As her own life she values, or before;<BR>
(I speak of one at whom young Cupid roves<BR>
With arrows which beneath the mantle gore)<BR>
His honour to his pleasure it behoves<BR>
That woman to prefer, by so much more,<BR>
As man beyond his life his honour treasures,<BR>
Esteemed by him above all other pleasures.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
His duty good Rogero satisfied,<BR>
Following the royal lord with whom he came;<BR>
For having no fair cause to quit his side,<BR>
He could not leave the Paynim without shame;<BR>
And, if his sire had by Almontes died,<BR>
In this, King Agramant was not to blame;<BR>
Who for his parents&#8217; every past offence<BR>
Had made Rogero mighty recompense.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
He will perform his duty to repair<BR>
To his liege-lord; so did that martial maid;<BR>
Who had not with reiterated prayer<BR>
(As so she might have done) Rogero stayed.<BR>
The stripling may appay the warlike fair<BR>
In other season, if not now appaid;<BR>
But twice two hundred years will not atone<BR>
The crying sin of honour once foregone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
To Arles-town whither had his king conveyed<BR>
His remnant of a host, he pricked anew;<BR>
While they that, since their kindred was displayed,<BR>
Had a close friendship formed&#8212;the damsels two&#8212;<BR>
Thither together go where Charles had made<BR>
His mightiest effort, with the Christian crew;<BR>
Hoping by siege or fight to break the foe,<BR>
And free his kingdom form so long a woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Bradamant, when she in the camp appeared,<BR>
Was greeted with a welcome warm and kind.<BR>
On all sides was she hailed, by all was cheered;<BR>
And she in this or that her head inclined.<BR>
Rinaldo, when he of her coming heard,<BR>
Met her; nor young Richardo stayed behind;<BR>
Nor Richardet; nor others of her race;<BR>
And all received the maid with joyful face.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
When next &#8217;tis known, the second of the twain<BR>
Is that Marphisa, so in arms renowned,<BR>
Who from Cat&agrave;y unto the bounds of Spain<BR>
Had journeyed, with a thousand laurels crowned,<BR>
Nor rich nor poor within their tents remain:<BR>
The curious crowd, encompassing them round,<BR>
Press, harm, and heave each other here and there,<BR>
In the sole wish to see so bright a pair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
By them was Charles saluted reverently,<BR>
And the first day was this (has Turpin shown)<BR>
Marphisa had been seen to bend her knee:<BR>
For Pepin&#8217;s royal son to her, alone,<BR>
Deserving of such duty seemed to be,<BR>
Mid emperors or kings that filled a throne,<BR>
Baptized or infidel, of all those named<BR>
For mighty riches, or for valour famed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Her kindly Charlemagne received, and wide<BR>
Of the pavilions met, in open view;<BR>
And, above king, and prince, and peer, beside<BR>
Himself the monarch placed that damsel true.<BR>
Who go not, are dismist; so none abide<BR>
In little time, except the good and few.<BR>
The Paladins and lords remain; without,<BR>
Is left the unrespected rabble-rout.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa first began in grateful strain:<BR>
&#8220;Unconquered Caesar, glorious and august,<BR>
Who, to Alcides&#8217; strait from Indian main,<BR>
Mak&#8217;st Scythian&#8217;s pale and Aethiop&#8217;s race adust<BR>
Revere thy Christian cross of snowy grain,<BR>
&#8212;Of earthly monarchs thou most sage and just&#8212;<BR>
Hither thy glory, which no limits bound,<BR>
Has brought me from the world&#8217;s extremest ground;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And (to avow the truth) in jealous mood<BR>
Alone I came, alone with thee to fight;<BR>
Because I grudged that king so puissant shou&#8217;d<BR>
Exist on earth, save he observed my rite.<BR>
Hence reek they ravaged fields with Christian blood;<BR>
And yet with greater rancour and despite,<BR>
Like cruel foe, I purposed to offend,<BR>
But that it chanced, one changed me to a friend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When to worst harm and scaith thy bands I doom,<BR>
I find (as at my leisure I will show)<BR>
Rogero of Risa was my father, whom<BR>
An evil brother traitorously laid low.<BR>
Me my sad mother carried in her womb<BR>
Beyond the sea, and bore in want and woe.<BR>
Till my seventh year by wizard nourished, I<BR>
Was stolen from him by thieves of Araby.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;They to a king in Persia vended me,<BR>
That after died beneath my faulchion, who<BR>
Would fain have taken my virginity.<BR>
When grown, that king and all his court I slew;<BR>
Chased his ill race, and seized his royalty;<BR>
And&#8212;such my fortune&#8212;by a month or two,<BR>
I eithteen years had not o&#8217;erpast, before<BR>
I added to my realm six kingdoms more;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, moved by envy of thy glorious fame<BR>
I in my heart resolved (as thou hast heard)<BR>
To abate the grandeur of they mighty name:<BR>
I haply so had done; I haply erred.<BR>
But now a chance has served that will to tame,<BR>
And clip my fury&#8217;s wings; the having heard<BR>
Since I arrived in Christendom, how we<BR>
Are bound by ties of consanguinity;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, for my father thee, as kinsman, served,<BR>
So thou a kin and servant hast in me;<BR>
And I that envy, that fierce hate, which nerved<BR>
Mine arm whilere, now blot from memory.<BR>
Nay, these for evil Agramant reserved,<BR>
And for his sire&#8217;s and uncle&#8217;s kin shall be;<BR>
They who were whilom guilty of the death<BR>
Of that unhappy pair, who gave me breath.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
She adds, the Christian faith she will receive,<BR>
And, after having spent king Agramant,<BR>
Will home return, with royal Charles&#8217;s leave,<BR>
Her kingdom to baptize in the Levant,<BR>
And war upon whatever nation cleave<BR>
To cheating Mahound or to Termagant;<BR>
Promising that whate&#8217;er her arms obtain<BR>
Shall be the Christian faith&#8217;s and empire&#8217;s gain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Charles, no less eloquent upon his side,<BR>
Than bold in deed and prudent in design,<BR>
Much that illustrious lady magnified,<BR>
And much her father, much her noble line:<BR>
He courteously to every point replied;<BR>
And of his heart his open front was sign.<BR>
As his last words, that he received the maid<BR>
As kinswoman and child, the monarch said.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Then rose and locked her in a new embrace,<BR>
And kissed her, like a daughter, on the brow.<BR>
Morgana and Clermont&#8217;s kin, with joyful face,<BR>
All thither troop; &#8217;twere tedious to tell how<BR>
Rinaldo did the gentle damsel grace;<BR>
For he had oftentimes espied ere now<BR>
Her martial prowess, tried by goodly test,<BR>
When they with girding siege Albracca pressed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twere long to tell how, with those worthies met,<BR>
Guido rejoiced to see Marphisa there;<BR>
Gryphon and Aquilant, and Sansonet,<BR>
That with her in the cruel city were;<BR>
Vivian, and Malagigi, and Richardet;<BR>
Who, when Maganza&#8217;s traitors made repair,<BR>
With those ill purchasers of Spain to trade,<BR>
Found such a faithful comrade in the maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
They deck the ground for the ensuing day;<BR>
And Charlemagne takes care himself to see<BR>
That they the place shall sumptuously array,<BR>
Wherein Marphisa&#8217;s baptism is to be.<BR>
Bishops are gathered, learned clerks, and they<BR>
Who ken the laws of Christianity;<BR>
That taught in all its doctrine by their care<BR>
And holy skill may be that martial fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
In sacred stole, pontifical, arraid,<BR>
Her the archbishop Turpin did baptize;<BR>
Charlemagne from the healthful font the maid<BR>
Uplifted with befitting ceremonies.<BR>
But it is time the witless head to aid<BR>
With that, which treasured in the phial lies,<BR>
Wherewith Astolpho, from the lowest star,<BR>
Descended in Elias&#8217; fiery car.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
The duke descended from the lucid round,<BR>
On this our earthly planet&#8217;s loftiest height.<BR>
Wither he with that blessed vase was bound,<BR>
Which was the mighty champion&#8217;s brain to right.<BR>
A herb of sovereign virtue on that ground<BR>
The apostle shows, and with it bids the knight<BR>
The Nubian&#8217;s eyeballs touch, when him anew<BR>
He visits, and restore that sovereign&#8217;s view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
That he, for this and for his first desert,<BR>
May give him bands, Biserta to assail;<BR>
And shows him how that people inexpert<BR>
He may to battle train, in plate and mail;<BR>
And how to pass the deserts, without hurt,<BR>
Where men are dazzled by the sandy gale.<BR>
The order that throughout should be maintained<BR>
From point to point, the sainted sire explained;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Then made him that plumed beast again bestride,<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s and Atlantes&#8217; steed whilere.<BR>
By sainted John dismist, his reverend guide,<BR>
Those holy regions left the cavalier;<BR>
And coasting Nile, on one or the other side,<BR>
Saw Nubia&#8217;s realm before him soon appear;<BR>
And there, in its chief city, to the ground<BR>
Descended, and anew Senapus found.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Great was the joy, and great was the delight,<BR>
Wherewith that king received the English lord;<BR>
Who well remembered how the gentle knight<BR>
Had from the loathsome harpies freed his board.<BR>
But when the humour, that obscured his sight,<BR>
Valiant Astolpho scaled, and now restored<BR>
Was the blind sovereign&#8217;s eyesight as before,<BR>
He would that warrior as a god adore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
So that not only those whom he demands<BR>
For the Bisertine war, he gives in aid;<BR>
But adds a hundred thousand from his bands,<BR>
And offer of his royal person made.<BR>
Scarce on the open plain embattled stands,<BR>
&#8212;All foot&#8212;the Nubian host, for war arraid.<BR>
For few the horses which that region bore;<BR>
Of elephants and camels a large store.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
The night before the day, when on its road<BR>
The Nubian force should march, Astolpho rose,<BR>
And his winged hippogryph again bestrode:<BR>
Then, hurrying ever south, in fury goes<BR>
To a high hill, the southern wind&#8217;s abode;<BR>
Whence he towards the Bears in fury blows:<BR>
There finds a cave, through whose strait entrance breaks<BR>
The fell and furious Auster, when he wakes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
He, as his master erst instruction gave,<BR>
With him an empty bladder had conveyed;<BR>
Which, at the vent of that dim Alpine cave,<BR>
Wherein reposed the wearied wind, was laid<BR>
Quaintly and softly by the baron brave;<BR>
And so unlooked for was the ambuscade,<BR>
That, issuing forth at morn, to sweep the plains,<BR>
Auster imprisoned in the skin remains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
To Nubia he, rejoicing in his prey,<BR>
Returns; and with that very light the peer,<BR>
With the black host, sets out upon his way,<BR>
And lets the victual follow in his rear.<BR>
Towards Mount Atlas with his whole array<BR>
In safety goes the glorious cavalier.<BR>
Through shifting plains of powdery sand he past,<BR>
Nor dreaded danger from the sultry blast;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
And having gained the mountain&#8217;s hither side,<BR>
Whence are discerned the plain, and distant brine,<BR>
He chooses from the swarm he has to guide<BR>
The noblest and most fit for discipline;<BR>
And makes them, here and there, in troops divide,<BR>
At a hill&#8217;s foot, wherewith the plains confine;<BR>
Then leaves his host and climbs the hill&#8217;s ascent,<BR>
Like one that is on lofty thoughts intent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
After he, lowly kneeling in the dust,<BR>
His holy master had implored, in true<BR>
Assurance he was heard, he downward thrust<BR>
A heap of stones. O what things may he do<BR>
That in the Saviour wholly puts his trust!<BR>
The stones beyond the use of nature grew;<BR>
Which rolling to the sandy plain below,<BR>
Next, neck and muzzle, legs and belly show.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
They, neighing shrill, down narrow paths repair,<BR>
With lusty leaps; and lighting on the plain,<BR>
Uplift the croup, like coursers as they are,<BR>
Some bay, some roan, and some of dapple stain.<BR>
The crowds that waiting in the valleys were,<BR>
Layed hands on them, and seized them by the rein.<BR>
Thus in a thought each soldier had his horse,<BR>
Born ready reined and saddled for the course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
He fourscore thousand of his Nubian power,<BR>
One hundred and two footmen, in a day<BR>
To horsemen changes, who wide Afric scour,<BR>
And, upon every side, sack, burn, and slay.<BR>
Agramant had intrusted town and tower,<BR>
Till his return, to king Branzardo&#8217;s sway,<BR>
To Fersa&#8217;s king, and him of the Algaziers;<BR>
And these against Astolpho lead their spears.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Erewhile a nimble bark, with sail and oar,<BR>
They had dispatched, which, stirring feet and wings,<BR>
News of the Nubian monarch&#8217;s outrage bore<BR>
To Agramant from his vicegerent kings,<BR>
That rests not, night nor day, till to the shore<BR>
Of Provence she her doleful tiding brings;<BR>
And finds her monarch half subdued in Arles,<BR>
For camped within a mile was conquering Charles.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Agramant, hearing in what peril lies<BR>
His realm, through his attack on Pepin&#8217;s reign,<BR>
Him in this pressing peril to advise,<BR>
Calls kings and princes of the paynim train;<BR>
And when he once or twice has turned his eyes<BR>
On sage Sobrino and the king of Spain,<BR>
&#8212;Eldest and wisest they those lords among&#8212;<BR>
The monarch so bespeaks the assembled throng:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Albeit if fits not captain, as I know,<BR>
To say, &#8216;on this I thought not,&#8217; this I say;<BR>
Because when from a quarter comes the blow,<BR>
From every human forethought far away,<BR>
&#8217;Tis for such fault a fair excuse, I trow;<BR>
And here all hinges; I did ill to lay<BR>
Unfurnished Africk open to attack,<BR>
If there was ground to fear the Nubian sack.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But who could think, save only God on high<BR>
Prescient of all which is to be below,<BR>
That, from land, beneath such distant sky,<BR>
Such mighty host would come, to work us woe?<BR>
&#8217;Twixt shifting sands, which restless whirlwinds blow:<BR>
Yet they their camp have round Biserta placed,<BR>
And laid the better part of Africk waste.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I now on this, O peers! your counsel crave.<BR>
If, bootless, homeward I should wend my way,<BR>
Or should not such a fair adventure wave,<BR>
Till Charles with me a prisoner I convey;<BR>
Or how I may as well our Africk save,<BR>
And ruin this redoubted empire, say.<BR>
Who can advise, is prayed his lore to shew,<BR>
That we may learn the best, and that pursue.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
He said; and on Marsilius seated nigh<BR>
Next turned his eyes, who in the signal read,<BR>
That it belonged to him to make reply<BR>
To what the king of Africa had said.<BR>
The Spaniard rose, and bending reverently<BR>
To Agramant the knee as well as head,<BR>
Again his honoured seat in council prest,<BR>
And in these words the Moorish king addrest:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My liege, does Rumour good or ill report,<BR>
It still increases them; hence shall I ne&#8217;er,<BR>
Under despondence, lack for due support,<BR>
Nor bolder course than is befitting steer,<BR>
For what may chance, of good or evil sort;<BR>
Weighing in even balance hope and fear,<BR>
O&#8217;errated still; and which we should not mete<BR>
By what I hear so many tongues repeat;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Which should so much more doubtfully be viewed,<BR>
As it seems less with likelihood to stand.<BR>
Now it is seen, if there be likelihood,<BR>
That king who reigns in so remote a land,<BR>
Followed by such a mighty multitude,<BR>
Should set his foot on warlike Africk&#8217;s strand;<BR>
Traversing sands, to which in evil hour<BR>
Cambyses trusted his ill-omened power.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I well believe, that from some neighbouring hill<BR>
The Arabs have poured down, to waste the plain;<BR>
Who, for the country was defended ill,<BR>
Have taken, burnt, destroyed and sacked and slain;<BR>
And that Branzardo, who your place doth fill,<BR>
As viceroy and lieutenant of the reign,<BR>
Has set down thousands, where he tens should write;<BR>
The better to excuse him in your sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The Nubian squadrons, I will even yield,<BR>
Have been rained down on Africk from the skies;<BR>
Or haply they have come, in clouds concealed,<BR>
In that their march was hidden from all eyes:<BR>
Think you, because unaided in the field,<BR>
Your Africk from such host in peril lies?<BR>
Your garrisons were sure of coward vein,<BR>
If they were scared by such a craven train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But will you send some frigates, albeit few,<BR>
(Provided that unfurled your standards be)<BR>
No sooner shall they loose from hence, that crew<BR>
Of spoilers shall within their confines flee;<BR>
&#8212;Nubians are they, or idle Arabs&#8212;who,<BR>
Knowing that you are severed by the sea<BR>
From your own realm, and warring with our band,<BR>
Have taken courage to assail your land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Now take your time for vengeance, when the son<BR>
Of Pepin is without his nephew&#8217;s aid.<BR>
Since bold Orlando is away, by none<BR>
Of the hostile sect resistance can be made.<BR>
If, through neglect or blindness, be foregone<BR>
The glorious Fortune, which for you has stayed,<BR>
She her bald front, as now her hair, will show,<BR>
To our long infamy and mighty woe.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Thus warily the Spanish king replied,<BR>
Proving by this and other argument,<BR>
The Moorish squadrons should in France abide,<BR>
Till Charlemagne was into exile sent.<BR>
But King Sobrino, he that plainly spied<BR>
The scope whereon Marsilius was intent,<BR>
To public good preferring private gain,<BR>
So spake in answer to the king of Spain:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My liege, when I to peace exhorted you,<BR>
Would that my prophecy had proved less just!<BR>
Of, if I was to prove a prophet true,<BR>
Ye in Sobrino had reposed more trust,<BR>
Than in King Rodomont and in that crew,<BR>
Alzirdo, Martasine and Marbalust!<BR>
Whom I would here see gladly, front to front;<BR>
But see most gladly boastful Rodomont.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To twit that warrior with his threat to do<BR>
By France, what by the brittle glass is done;<BR>
And throughout heaven and hell your course pursue,<BR>
Yea (as the monarch said) your course outrun.<BR>
Yet lapt in foul and loathsome ease, while you<BR>
So need his help, lies Ulien&#8217;s lazy son;<BR>
And I, that as a coward was decried<BR>
For my true prophecy, am at your side;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And ever will be while this life I bear;<BR>
Which, albeit &#8217;tis with yours sore laden, still<BR>
Daily for you is risked with them that are<BR>
The best of France; and&#8212;be he who he will&#8212;<BR>
There is not mortal living, who will dare<BR>
To say Sobrino&#8217;s deeds were ever ill:<BR>
Yea, many who vaunt more, amid your host,<BR>
Have not so much, nay lighter, cause for boast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I speak, these words to show that what whilere<BR>
I said and say again, has neither sprung<BR>
From evil heart, nor is the fruit of fear;<BR>
But that true love and duty move my tongue.<BR>
You homeward with what haste you may to steer,<BR>
I counsel, your assembled bands among;<BR>
For little is the wisdom of that wight,<BR>
Who risks his own to gain another&#8217;s right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If there be gain, ye know, Late thirty-two,<BR>
Your vassal kings, with you our sails we spread;<BR>
Now, if we pause to sum the account anew,<BR>
Hardly a third survives; the rest are dead.<BR>
May it please Heaven no further loss ensue!<BR>
But if you will pursue your quest, I dread<BR>
Lest not a fourth nor fifth will soon remain;<BR>
And wholly spent will be your wretched train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Orlando&#8217;s absence so far aids, that where<BR>
Our troops are few, there haply none would be;<BR>
But not through this removed our perils are,<BR>
Though it prolongs our evil destiny.<BR>
Behold Rinaldo! whom his deeds declare<BR>
No less than bold Orlando; of his tree<BR>
There are the shoots; with paladin and peer,<BR>
Our baffled Saracens&#8217; eternal fear;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And the other Mars (albeit against my heart<BR>
It goes to waste my praise upon a foe);<BR>
I speak of the redoubted Brandimart,<BR>
Whose feats no less than fierce Orlando&#8217;s show;<BR>
Whose mighty prowess I have proved in part,<BR>
In part, at others&#8217; cost I see and know.<BR>
Then many days Orlando has been gone;<BR>
Yet we have lost more fields than we have won.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I fear, if heretofore our band has lost,<BR>
A heavier forfeit will henceforth be paid.<BR>
Blotted is Mandricardo from our host;<BR>
Martial Gradasso hath withdrawn his aid;<BR>
Marphisa, at our worst, has left her post;<BR>
So Argier&#8217;s lord; of whom it may be said,<BR>
Where he as true as strong, we should not need<BR>
Gradasso and the Tartar king, to speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;While aids like these are lost to our array,<BR>
While on our side such slaughtered thousands lie,<BR>
Those looked-for are arrived, nor on her way<BR>
Is any vessel fraught with new supply&#8212;<BR>
Charles has been joined by four, that, as they say,<BR>
Might with Orlando or Rinaldo vie;<BR>
With reasons, for from hence to Bactrian shore,<BR>
Ill would you hope to find such other four.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I know not if you know who Guido are,<BR>
Sansonet, and the sons of Olivier.<BR>
For these I more respect, more fear I bear,<BR>
Than any warlike duke or cavalier,<BR>
Of Almayn&#8217;s or of other lineage fair,<BR>
Who for the Roman empire rests the spear,<BR>
Though I misrate not those of newer stamp,<BR>
That, to our scathe, are gathered in their camp.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As often as ye issue on the plain,<BR>
Worsted so oft, or broken, shall you be.<BR>
If oft united Africa and Spain<BR>
Were losers, when sixteen to eight were we,<BR>
What will ensue, when banded with Almayn<BR>
Are England, Scotland, France, and Italy?<BR>
When with our six twice six their weapons cross,<BR>
What else can we expect but shame and loss?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You lose your people here, and there your reign,<BR>
If you in this emprize are obstinate;<BR>
&#8212;Returning&#8212;us, the remnant of your train,<BR>
You save, together with your royal state.<BR>
It were ill done to leave the king of Spain,<BR>
Since all for this would hold you sore ingrate;<BR>
Yet there&#8217;s a remedy in peace; which, so<BR>
It pleases but yourself, will please the foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But, if, as first defeated, on your part<BR>
It seems a shame to offer peace, and ye<BR>
Have war and wasteful battle more at heart,<BR>
Waged hitherto with what success you see,<BR>
At least to gain the victory use art,<BR>
Which may be yours, if you are ruled by me.<BR>
Lay all our quarrel&#8217;s trial on one peer,<BR>
And let Rogero be that cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Such our Rogero is, ye know and I,<BR>
That&#8212;pitted one to one in listed fight&#8212;<BR>
Not Roland, not Rinaldo stands more high,<BR>
Nor whatsoever other Christian knight.<BR>
But would ye kindle warfare far and nigh,<BR>
Though superhuman be that champion&#8217;s might,<BR>
The warrior is but one mid many spears,<BR>
Matched singly with a host of martial peers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Meseemeth, if to you it seemeth good,<BR>
Ye should propose to Charles the war to end;<BR>
And that, to spare the constant waste of blood,<BR>
Which his, and countless of your warriors spend,<BR>
He&#8212;by a knight of yours to be withstood&#8212;<BR>
A champion, chosen from his best should send;<BR>
And those two all the warfare wage alone,<BR>
Till one prevails, and one is overthrown;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;On pact the king, whose champion in the just<BR>
Is loser, tribute to that other pay.<BR>
Nor will this pact displease King Charles, I trust,<BR>
Though his was the advantage in the fray.<BR>
Then of his arms Rogero so robust<BR>
I deem, that he will surely win the day;<BR>
Who would prevail (so certain is our right)<BR>
Though Mars himself should be his opposite.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
With these and other sayings yet more sound,<BR>
So wrought Sobrino, he his end obtained;<BR>
And on that day interpreters were found,<BR>
And they that day to Charles their charge explained.<BR>
Charles, whom such matchless cavaliers surround.<BR>
Believes the battle is already gained;<BR>
And chooses good Rinaldo for the just,<BR>
Next to Orlando in his sovereign&#8217;s trust.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
In this accord like cause for pleasure find,<BR>
As well the Christian as the paynim foe:<BR>
For, harassed sore in body and in mind,<BR>
Those warriors all were weary, all were woe.<BR>
Each in repose and quietude designed<BR>
To pass what time remained to him below:<BR>
Each cursed the senseless anger and the hate<BR>
Which stirred their hearts to discord and debate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo felt himself much magnified,<BR>
That Charles, for what in him so strong weighed,<BR>
More trusted him than all his court beside,<BR>
And glad the honoured enterprise assayed:<BR>
Rogero he esteemed not in his pride,<BR>
And thought he ill could keep him from his blade.<BR>
Nor deemed the Child could equal him in fight,<BR>
Albeit he slew in strife the Tartar knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero, though much honoured, on his part,<BR>
That him his king has chosen from the rest,<BR>
To whom a trust so weighty to impart,<BR>
As of his many martial lords the best,<BR>
Yet shows a troubled face; not that the heart<BR>
Of that good knight unworthy fears molest;<BR>
Not only none Rinaldo would have bred;<BR>
Him, with Orlando leagued, he would not dread&#8212;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
But because sister of the Christian knight<BR>
(He knows) is she, his consort true and dear;<BR>
That to the stripling evermore did write,<BR>
As one sore injured by that cavalier.<BR>
Now, if to ancient sins he should unite<BR>
A mortal combat with Montalban&#8217;s peer,<BR>
Her, although loving, will he anger so,<BR>
Not lightly she her hatred will forego.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
If silently Rogero made lament<BR>
That he in his despite must battle do;<BR>
In sobs his consort dear to hers gave vent,<BR>
When shortly to her ears the tidings flew.<BR>
She beat her breast, her golden tresses rent:<BR>
Fast, scalding tears her innocent cheeks bedew:<BR>
She taxes young Rogero as ingrate,<BR>
And aye cries out upon her cruel fate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
Nought can result to Bradamant but pain,<BR>
Whatever is the doubtful combat&#8217;s end.<BR>
She will not think Rogero can be slain;<BR>
For this, &#8217;twould seem, her very heart would rend;<BR>
And should our Lord the fall of France ordain,<BR>
That kingdom for more sins than one to amend,<BR>
The gentle maid, beside a brother&#8217;s loss,<BR>
Would have to weep a worse and bitterer cross.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
For, without shame and scorn, she never may,<BR>
Not without hatred of her kin combined,<BR>
To her loved lord return in such a way<BR>
As that it may be known of all mankind;<BR>
As, thinking upon this by night and day,<BR>
She oftentimes had purposed in her mind;<BR>
And so by promise both were tied withal,<BR>
Room for repentance and retreat was small.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
But she, that ever, when things adverse were,<BR>
With faithful succour Bradamant had stayed,<BR>
I say the weird Melissa, could not bear<BR>
To hear the wailings of the woeful maid;<BR>
She hurried to console her in her care,<BR>
And proffered succour in due time and said,<BR>
She would disturb that duel &#8217;twixt the twain,<BR>
The occasion of such grief and cruel pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile their weapons for the future fray<BR>
Rogero and Duke Aymon&#8217;s son prepared;<BR>
The choice whereof with that good warrior lay,<BR>
The Roman empire&#8217;s knight by Charles declared;<BR>
And he, like one that ever from the day<BR>
He lost his goodly steed afoot had fared,<BR>
Made choice, afoot and fenced with plate and mail,<BR>
His foe with axe and dagger to assail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Whether Chance moved Mountalban&#8217;s martial lord,<BR>
Or Malagigi, provident and sage,<BR>
That knew how young Rogero&#8217;s charmed sword<BR>
Cleft helm and hauberk in its greedy rage,<BR>
One and the other warrior made accord,<BR>
(As said) without their faulchions to engage.<BR>
The place of combat chosen by that twain<BR>
Was near old Arles, upon a spacious plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Watchful Aurora hardly from the bower<BR>
Of old Tithonus hath put forth her head,<BR>
To give beginning to the day and hour<BR>
Prefixed and ordered for that duel dread,<BR>
When deputies from either hostile power,<BR>
On this side and on that forth issuing, spread<BR>
Tents at each entrance of the lists; and near<BR>
The two pavillions, both, an altar rear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
After short pause, was seen upon the plain<BR>
The paynim host in different squadrons dight.<BR>
Rich in barbarick pomp, amid that train,<BR>
Rode Africk&#8217;s monarch, ready armed for fight:<BR>
Bay was the steed he backed, with sable mane;<BR>
Two of his legs were pied, his forehead white<BR>
Fast beside Agramant, Rogero came,<BR>
And him to serve Marsilius thought no shame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
The casque that he from Mandricardo wrung<BR>
In single combat with such travel sore,<BR>
The casque that (as in loftier strain is sung)<BR>
Cased Hector&#8217;s head, a thousand years before,<BR>
Marsilius carried, by his side, among<BR>
Princes and lords, that severally bore<BR>
The other harness of Rogero bold,<BR>
Enriched with precious pearls and rough with gold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
On the other part, without his camp appears<BR>
Charles, with his men at arms in squadrons dight;<BR>
Who in such order led his cavaliers,<BR>
As they would keep, if marshalled for the fight.<BR>
Fenced is the monarch with his famous peers,<BR>
And with him wends, all armed, Montalban&#8217;s knight,<BR>
Armed, save his helmet, erst Mambrino&#8217;s casque;<BR>
To carry which is Danish Ogier&#8217;s task;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
And, of two axes, hath Duke Namus one,<BR>
King Salamon the other: Charlemagne<BR>
Is to this side, with all his following, gone,<BR>
To that wend those of Africk and of Spain.<BR>
In the mid space between the hosts is none;<BR>
Empty remains large portion of the plain;<BR>
For he is doomed to death who thither goes,<BR>
By joint proclaim, except the chosen foes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
After the second choice of arms was made<BR>
By him, the champion of the paynim clan,<BR>
Thither two priests of either sect conveyed<BR>
Two books; that, carried by one holy man,<BR>
&#8212;Him of our law&#8212;Christ&#8217;s perfect life displayed;<BR>
Those others&#8217; volume was their Alcoran.<BR>
The emperor in his hands the Gospel took,<BR>
The king of Africa that other book.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Charlemagne, at his altar, to the sky<BR>
Lifted his hands, &#8220;O God, that for our sake&#8221;<BR>
(Exclaimed the monarch) &#8220;wast content to die,<BR>
Thyself a ransom for our sins to make;<BR>
&#8212;O thou that found such favour in his eye,<BR>
That God from thee the flesh of man did take,<BR>
Borne for nine months within thy holy womb,<BR>
While aye thy virgin flower preserved its bloom,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Hear, and be witnesses of what I say,<BR>
For me and those that after me shall reign,<BR>
To Agramant and those that heir his sway,<BR>
I twenty loads of gold of perfect grain<BR>
Will every year deliver, if to-day<BR>
My champion vanquished in the lists remain;<BR>
And vow I will straightway from warfare cease,<BR>
And from henceforth maintain perpetual peace;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And may your joint and fearful wrath descend<BR>
On me forthwith, if I my word forego!<BR>
And may it me and mine alone offend,<BR>
And none beside, amid this numerous show!<BR>
That all in briefest time may comprehend,<BR>
My breach of promise has brought down the woe.&#8221;<BR>
So saying, in his hand the holy book<BR>
Charles held, and fixed on heaven his earnest look.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
This done, they seek that altar, sumptuously<BR>
Decked for the purpose, by the pagan train;<BR>
Where their king swears, that he will pass the sea,<BR>
With all his army, to his Moorish reign,<BR>
And to King Charles will tributary be;<BR>
If vanquished, young Rogero shall remain;<BR>
And will observe the truce for evermore<BR>
Upon the pact declared by Charles before;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
And like him, nor in under tone, he swears,<BR>
Calling on Mahound to attest his oath;<BR>
And on the volume which his pontiff bears,<BR>
To observe what he has promised plights his troth.<BR>
Then to his side each hastily repairs;<BR>
And mid their several powers are harboured both.<BR>
Next these, to swear arrive the champions twain;<BR>
And this the promise which their oaths contain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Rogero pledges first his knightly word,<BR>
Should his king mar, or send to mar, the fray,<BR>
He him no more as leader or as lord<BR>
Will serve, but wholly Charlemagne obey.<BR>
&#8212;Rinaldo&#8212;if in breach of their accord,<BR>
Him from the field King Charles would bear away,<BR>
Till one or the other is subdued in fight,<BR>
That he will be the Moorish monarch&#8217;s knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
When ended are the ceremonies, here<BR>
And there, to seek their camps the two divide.<BR>
Nor long, therein delayed; when trumpets clear<BR>
The time for their encounter signified:<BR>
Now to the charge advanced each cavalier,<BR>
Measuring with cautious care his every stride.<BR>
Lo! the assault begins; now low, now high,<BR>
That pair the sounding steel in circles ply.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Now with the axe&#8217;s blade, now with its heel<BR>
Their strokes they at the head or foot address;<BR>
And these so skilfully and nimbly deal,<BR>
As needs must shock all credence to express.<BR>
The Child, that at her brother aims the steel,<BR>
Who doth his miserable soul possess,<BR>
Evermore with such caution strikes his blow,<BR>
That he is deemed less vigorous than his foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Rather to parry then to smite intent,<BR>
He know not what to wish; that low should lie<BR>
Rinaldo, would Rogero ill content,<BR>
Nor willingly the Child by him would die.<BR>
But here I am at my full line&#8217;s extent,<BR>
Where I must needs defer my history.<BR>
In other canto shall the rest appear,<BR>
If you that other canto please to hear.</TD></TR>
