And most the thirsty plant of moisture drains,<br />
The weak and wasting flower, well nigh deprived<br />
Of that quick sap which circled in its veins,<br />
Sucks in the welcome rain, and is revived;<br />
So, when bold Bradamant so well maintains<br />
The courier maid’s defence, her beauteous cheer<br />
And mirth revive, and brighten as whilere.</td>

Nor yet was touched, enjoys each hungry guest;<br />
Nor any further news of errant knight<br />
Them, seated at the festive board, molest;<br />
All, saving Bradamant, enjoy, whose sprite,<br />
As wont, is still afflicted and opprest.<br />
For that suspicious fear, that doubt unjust,<br />
Which racked her bosom, marred the damsel’s gust.</td>

Haply from their desire to feast their eyes—<br />
First of the set, Duke Aymon’s daughter rose,<br />
And next the courier maid is seen to rise.<br />
With that the warder signs to one, that goes<br />
And many torches fires in nimble wise;<br />
Whose light on storied wall and ceiling fell.<br />
What followed shall another canto tell.</td>
