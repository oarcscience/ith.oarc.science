Angelica, whom pressing danger frights,<BR>
Flies in disorder through the greenwood shade.<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s horse escapes: he, following, fights<BR>
Ferrau, the Spaniard, in a forest glade.<BR>
A second oath the haughty paynim plights,<BR>
And keeps it better than the first he made.<BR>
King Sacripant regains his long-lost treasure;<BR>
But good Rinaldo mars his promised pleasure.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
O<SMALL>F LOVES</SMALL> and <SMALL>LADIES, KNIGHTS</SMALL> and <SMALL>ARMS</SMALL>, I sing,<BR>
Of <SMALL>COURTESIES</SMALL>, and many a <SMALL>DARING FEAT</SMALL>;<BR>
And from those ancient days my story bring,<BR>
When Moors from Afric passed in hostile fleet,<BR>
And ravaged France, with Agramant their king,<BR>
Flushed with his youthful rage and furious heat;<BR>
Who on king Charles&#8217;, the Roman emperor&#8217;s head<BR>
Had vowed due vengeance for Troyano dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
In the same strain of Roland will I tell<BR>
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme,<BR>
On whom strange madness and rank fury fell,<BR>
A man esteemed so wise in former time;<BR>
If she, who to like cruel pass has well<BR>
Nigh brought my feeble wit which fain would climb<BR>
And hourly wastes my sense, concede me skill<BR>
And strength my daring promise to fulfil.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Good seed of Hercules, give ear and deign,<BR>
Thou that this age&#8217;s grace and splendour art,<BR>
Hippolitus, to smile upon his pain<BR>
Who tenders what he has with humble heart.<BR>
For though all hope to quit the score were vain,<BR>
My pen and pages may pay the debt in part;<BR>
Then, with no jealous eye my offering scan,<BR>
Nor scorn my gifts who give thee all I can.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
And me, amid the worthiest shalt thou hear,<BR>
Whom I with fitting praise prepare to grace,<BR>
Record the good Rogero, valiant peer,<BR>
The ancient root of thine illustrious race.<BR>
Of him, if thou wilt lend a willing ear,<BR>
The worth and warlike feats I shall retrace;<BR>
So thou thy graver cares some little time<BR>
Postponing, lend thy leisure to my rhyme.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Roland, who long the lady of Cat&agrave;y,<BR>
Angelica, had loved, and with his brand<BR>
Raised countless trophies to that damsel gay,<BR>
In India, Median, and Tartarian land,<BR>
Westward with her had measured back his way;<BR>
Where, nigh the Pyrenees, with many a band<BR>
Of Germany and France, King Charlemagne<BR>
Had camped his faithful host upon the plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
To make King Agramant, for penance, smite<BR>
His cheek, and rash Marsilius rue the hour;<BR>
<I>This</I>, when all trained with lance and sword to fight,<BR>
He led from Africa to swell his power;<BR>
<I>That other</I> when he pushed, in fell despite,<BR>
Against the realm of France Spain&#8217;s martial flower.<BR>
&#8217;Twas thus Orlando came where Charles was tented<BR>
In evil hour, and soon the deed repented.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
For here was seized his dame of peerless charms,<BR>
(How often human judgment wanders wide)!<BR>
Whom in long warfare he had kept from harms,<BR>
From western climes to eastern shores her guide<BR>
In his own land, &#8217;mid friends and kindred arms,<BR>
Now without contest severed from his side.<BR>
Fearing the mischief kindled by her eyes,<BR>
From him the prudent emperor reft the prize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
For bold Orlando and his cousin, free<BR>
Rinaldo, late contended for the maid,<BR>
Enamored of that beauty rare; since she<BR>
Alike the glowing breast of either swayed.<BR>
But Charles, who little liked such rivalry,<BR>
And drew an omen thence of feebler aid,<BR>
To abate the cause of quarrel, seized the fair,<BR>
And placed her in Bavarian Namus&#8217; care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Vowing with her the warrior to content,<BR>
Who in that conflict, on that fatal day,<BR>
With his good hand most gainful succour lent,<BR>
And slew most paynims in the martial fray.<BR>
But counter to his hopes the battle went,<BR>
And his thinned squadrons fled in disarray;<BR>
Namus, with other Christian captains taken,<BR>
And his pavilion in the rout forsaken.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
There, lodged by Charles, that gentle bonnibel,<BR>
Ordained to be the valiant victor&#8217;s meed,<BR>
Before the event had sprung into her sell,<BR>
And from the combat turned in time of need;<BR>
Presaging wisely Fortune would rebel<BR>
That fatal day against the Christian creed:<BR>
And, entering a thick wood, discovered near,<BR>
In a close path, a horseless cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
With shield upon his arm, in knightly wise,<BR>
Belted and mailed, his helmet on his head;<BR>
The knight more lightly through the forest hies<BR>
Than half-clothed churl to win the cloth of red.<BR>
But not from cruel snake more swiftly flies<BR>
The timid shepherdess, with startled tread,<BR>
Than poor Angelica the bridle turns<BR>
When she the approaching knight on foot discerns.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
This was that Paladin, good Aymon&#8217;s seed,<BR>
Who Mount Albano had in his command;<BR>
And late Bayardo lost, his gallant steed,<BR>
Escaped by strange adventure from his hand.<BR>
As soon as seen, the maid who rode at speed<BR>
The warrior knew, and, while yet distant, scanned<BR>
The angelic features and the gentle air<BR>
Which long had held him fast in Cupid&#8217;s snare.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
The affrighted damsel turns her palfrey round,<BR>
And shakes the floating bridle in the wind;<BR>
Nor in her panic seeks to choose her ground,<BR>
Nor open grove prefers to thicket blind.<BR>
But reckless, pale and trembling, and astound,<BR>
Leaves to her horse the devious way to find.<BR>
He up and down the forest bore the dame,<BR>
Till to a sylvan river&#8217;s bank he came.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Here stood the fierce Ferrau in grisly plight,<BR>
Begrimed with dust, and bathed with sweat and blood<BR>
Who lately had withdrawn him from the fight,<BR>
To rest and drink at that refreshing flood:<BR>
But there had tarried in his own despite,<BR>
Since bending from the bank, in hasty mood,<BR>
He dropped his helmet in the crystal tide,<BR>
And vainly to regain the treasure tried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Thither at speed she drives, and evermore<BR>
In her wild panic utters fearful cries;<BR>
And at the voice, upleaping on the shore,<BR>
The Saracen her lovely visage spies.<BR>
And, pale as is her cheek, and troubled sore,<BR>
Arriving, quickly to the warrior&#8217;s eyes<BR>
(Though many days no news of her had shown)<BR>
The beautiful Angelica is known.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Courteous, and haply gifted with a breast<BR>
As warm as either of the cousins two;<BR>
As bold, as if his brows in steel were dressed,<BR>
The succour which she sought he lent, and drew<BR>
His faulchion, and against Rinaldo pressed,<BR>
Who saw with little fear the champion true.<BR>
Not only each to each was known by sight,<BR>
But each had proved in arms his foeman&#8217;s might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Thus, as they are, on foot the warriors vie<BR>
In cruel strife, and blade to blade oppose;<BR>
No marvel plate or brittle mail should fly,<BR>
When anvils had not stood the deafening blows.<BR>
It now behoves the palfrey swift to ply<BR>
His feet; for while the knights in combat close,<BR>
Him vexed to utmost speed, with goading spurs,<BR>
By waste or wood the frighted damsel stirs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
After the two had struggled long to throw<BR>
Each other in the strife, and vainly still;<BR>
Since neither valiant warrior was below<BR>
His opposite in force and knightly skill:<BR>
The first to parley with his Spanish foe<BR>
Was the good master of Albano&#8217;s hill<BR>
(As one within whose raging breast was pent<BR>
A reckless fire which struggled for a vent).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou think&#8217;st,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to injure me alone,<BR>
But know thou wilt thyself as much molest:<BR>
For if we fight because yon rising sun<BR>
This raging heat has kindled in thy breast.<BR>
What were thy gain, and what the guerdon won,<BR>
Though I should yield my life, or stoop my crest;<BR>
If she shall never be thy glorious meed,<BR>
Who flies, while vainly we in battle bleed?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then how much better, since our stake&#8217;s the same,<BR>
Thou, loving like myself, should&#8217;st mount and stay<BR>
To wait this battle&#8217;s end, the lovely dame,<BR>
Before she fly yet further on her way.<BR>
The lady taken, we repeat our claim<BR>
With naked faulchion to that peerless prey:<BR>
Else by long toil I see not what we gain<BR>
But simple loss and unrequited pain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
The peer&#8217;s proposal pleased the paynim well.<BR>
And so their hot contention was foregone;<BR>
And such fair truce replaced that discord fell,<BR>
So mutual wrongs forgot and mischief done;<BR>
That for departure seated in his sell,<BR>
On foot the Spaniard left not Aymon&#8217;s son;<BR>
But him to mount his courser&#8217;s crupper prayed;<BR>
And both united chased the royal maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Oh! goodly truth in cavaliers of old!<BR>
Rivals they were, to different faith were bred.<BR>
Not yet the weary warriors&#8217; wounds were cold&#8212;<BR>
Still smarting from those strokes so fell and dread.<BR>
Yet they together ride by waste and wold,<BR>
And, unsuspecting, devious dingle thread.<BR>
Them, while four spurs infest his foaming sides,<BR>
Their courser brings to where the way divides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
And now the warlike pair at fault, for they<BR>
Knew not by which she might her palfrey goad,<BR>
(Since both, without distinction, there survey<BR>
The recent print of hoofs on either road),<BR>
Commit the chase to fortune. By this way<BR>
The paynim pricked, by that Rinaldo strode.<BR>
But fierce Ferrau, bewildered in the wood,<BR>
Found himself once again where late he stood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Beside the water, where he stoop&#8217;d to drink,<BR>
And dropt the knightly helmet,&#8212;to his cost,<BR>
Sunk in the stream; and since he could not think<BR>
Her to retrieve, who late his hopes had crossed.<BR>
He, where the treasure fell, descends the brink<BR>
Of that swift stream, and seeks the morion lost.<BR>
But the casque lies so bedded in the sands,<BR>
&#8217;Twill ask no light endeavour at his hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
A bough he severs from a neighbouring tree,<BR>
And shreds and shapes the branch into a pole:<BR>
With this he sounds the stream, and anxiously<BR>
Fathoms, and rakes, and ransacks shelf and hole.<BR>
While angered sore at heart, and restless, he<BR>
So lingered, where the troubled waters roll,<BR>
Breast-high, from the mid river rose upright,<BR>
The apparition of an angry knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Armed at all points he was, except his head,<BR>
And in his better hand a helmet bore:<BR>
The very casque, which in the river&#8217;s bed<BR>
Ferrau sought vainly, toiling long and sore.<BR>
Upon the Spanish knight he frowned, and said:<BR>
&#8220;Thou traitor to thy word, thou perjured Moor,<BR>
Why grieve the goodly helmet to resign,<BR>
Which, due to me long since, is justly mine?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Remember, pagan, when thine arm laid low<BR>
The brother of Angelica. That knight<BR>
Am I;&#8212;thy word was plighted then to throw<BR>
After my other arms his helmet bright.<BR>
If Fortune now compel thee to forego<BR>
The prize, and do my will in thy despite,<BR>
Grieve not at this, but rather grieve that thou<BR>
Art found a perjured traitor to thy vow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if thou seek&#8217;st a helmet, be thy task<BR>
To win and wear it more to thy renown.<BR>
A noble prize were good Orlando&#8217;s casque;<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s such, or yet a fairer crown;<BR>
Almontes&#8217;, or Mambrino&#8217;s iron masque:<BR>
Make one of these, by force of arms, thine own.<BR>
And this good helm will fitly be bestowed<BR>
Where (such thy promise) it has long been owed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Bristled the paynim&#8217;s every hair at view<BR>
Of that grim shade, uprising from the tide,<BR>
And vanished was his fresh and healthful hue,<BR>
While on his lips the half-formed accents died.<BR>
Next hearing Argal&igrave;a, whom he slew,<BR>
(So was the warrior hight) that stream beside,<BR>
Thus his unknightly breach of promise blame,<BR>
He burned all over, flushed with rage and shame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Nor having time his falsehood to excuse,<BR>
And knowing well how true the phantom&#8217;s lore,<BR>
Stood speechless; such remorse the words infuse.<BR>
Then by Lanfusa&#8217;s life the warrior swore,<BR>
Never in fight, or foray would he use<BR>
Helmet but that which good Orlando bore<BR>
From Aspramont, where bold Almontes paid<BR>
His life a forfeit to the Christian blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
And this new vow discharged more faithfully<BR>
Than the vain promise which was whilom plight;<BR>
And from the stream departing heavily,<BR>
Was many days sore vexed and grieved in sprite;<BR>
And still intent to seek Orlando, he<BR>
Roved wheresoe&#8217;er he hoped to find the knight.<BR>
A different lot befel Rinaldo; who<BR>
Had chanced another pathway to pursue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
For far the warrior fared not, ere he spied,<BR>
Bounding across the path, his gallant steed,<BR>
And, &#8220;Stay, Bayardo mine,&#8221; Rinaldo cried,<BR>
&#8220;Too cruel care the loss of thee does breed.&#8221;<BR>
The horse for this returned not to his side,<BR>
Deaf to his prayer, but flew with better speed.<BR>
Furious, in chase of him, Rinaldo hies.<BR>
But follow we Angelica, who flies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
Through dreary woods and dark the damsel fled,<BR>
By rude unharboured heath and savage height,<BR>
While every leaf or spray that rustled, bred<BR>
(Of oak, or elm, or beech), such new affright,<BR>
She here and there her foaming palfrey sped<BR>
By strange and crooked paths with furious flight;<BR>
And at each shadow, seen in valley blind,<BR>
Or mountain, feared Rinaldo was behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
As a young roe or fawn of fallow deer,<BR>
Who, mid the shelter of its native glade,<BR>
Has seen a hungry pard or tiger tear<BR>
The bosom of its bleeding dam, dismayed,<BR>
Bounds, through the forest green in ceaseless fear<BR>
Of the destroying beast, from shade to shade,<BR>
And at each sapling touched, amid its pangs,<BR>
Believes itself between the monster&#8217;s fangs,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
One day and night, and half the following day,<BR>
The damsel wanders wide, nor whither knows;<BR>
Then enters a deep wood, whose branches play,<BR>
Moved lightly by the freshening breeze which blows.<BR>
Through this two clear and murmuring rivers stray:<BR>
Upon their banks a fresher herbage grows;<BR>
While the twin streams their passage slowly clear,<BR>
Make music with the stones, and please the ear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Weening removed the way by which she wends,<BR>
A thousand miles from loathed Rinaldo&#8217;s beat,<BR>
To rest herself a while the maid intends,<BR>
Wearied with that long flight and summer&#8217;s heat.<BR>
She from her saddle &#8217;mid spring flowers descends<BR>
And takes the bridle from her courser fleet.<BR>
And loose along the river lets him pass,<BR>
Roving the banks in search of lusty grass.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Behold! at hand a thicket she surveys<BR>
Gay with the flowering thorn and vermeil rose:<BR>
The tuft reflected in the stream which strays<BR>
Beside it, overshadowing oaks enclose.<BR>
Hollow within, and safe from vulgar gaze,<BR>
It seemed a place constructed for repose;<BR>
With bows so interwoven, that the light<BR>
Pierced not the tangled screen, far less the sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Within soft moss and herbage form a bed;<BR>
And to delay and rest the traveller woo.<BR>
&#8217;Twas there her limbs the weary damsel spread,<BR>
Her eye-balls bathed in slumber&#8217;s balmy dew.<BR>
But little time had eased her drooping head,<BR>
Ere, as she weened, a courser&#8217;s tramp she knew.<BR>
Softly she rises, and the river near,<BR>
Armed cap-&agrave;-pi&egrave;, beholds a cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
If friend or foe, she nothing comprehends,<BR>
(So hope and fear her doubting bosom tear)<BR>
And that adventure&#8217;s issue mute attends,<BR>
Nor even with a sigh disturbs the air.<BR>
The cavalier upon the bank descends;<BR>
And sits so motionless, so lost in care,<BR>
(His visage propt upon his arm) to sight<BR>
Changed into senseless stone appeared the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Pensive, above an hour, with drooping head,<BR>
He rested mute, ere he began his moan;<BR>
And then his piteous tale of sorrow said,<BR>
Lamenting in so soft and sweet a tone,<BR>
He in a tiger&#8217;s breast had pity bred,<BR>
Or with his mournful wailings rent a stone.<BR>
And so he sighed and wept; like rivers flowed<BR>
His tears, his bosom like an &AElig;tna glowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thought which now makes me burn, now freeze with hate,<BR>
Which gnaws my heart and rankles at its root!<BR>
What&#8217;s left to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;arrived too late,<BR>
While one more favoured bears away the fruit?<BR>
Bare words and looks scarce cheered my hopeless state,<BR>
And the prime spoils reward another&#8217;s suit.<BR>
Then since for me nor fruit nor blossom hangs,<BR>
Why should I longer pine in hopeless pangs?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The virgin has her image in the rose<BR>
Sheltered in garden on its native stock,<BR>
Which there in solitude and safe repose,<BR>
Blooms unapproached by sheperd or by flock.<BR>
For this earth teems, and freshening water flows,<BR>
And breeze and dewy dawn their sweets unlock:<BR>
With such the wistful youth his bosom dresses,<BR>
With such the enamored damsel braids her tresses.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But wanton hands no sooner this displace<BR>
From the maternal stem, where it was grown,<BR>
Than all is withered; whatsoever grace<BR>
It found with man or heaven; bloom, beauty, gone.<BR>
The damsel who should hold in higher place<BR>
Than light or life the flower which is her own,<BR>
Suffering the spoiler&#8217;s hand to crop the prize,<BR>
Forfeits her worth in every other&#8217;s eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And be she cheap with all except the wight<BR>
On whom she did so large a boon bestow.<BR>
Ah! false and cruel Fortune! foul despite!<BR>
While others triumph, I am drown&#8217;d in woe.<BR>
And can it be that I such treasure slight?<BR>
And can I then my very life forego?<BR>
No! let me die; &#8217;twere happiness above<BR>
A longer life, if I must cease to love.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
If any ask who made this sorrowing,<BR>
And pour&#8217;d into the stream so many tears,<BR>
I answer, it was fair Circassia&#8217;s king,<BR>
That Sacripant, oppressed with amorous cares.<BR>
Love is the source from which his troubles spring,<BR>
The sole occasion of his pains and fears;<BR>
And he to her a lover&#8217;s service paid,<BR>
Now well remembered by the royal maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
He for her sake from Orient&#8217;s farthest reign<BR>
Roved thither, where the sun descends to rest;<BR>
For he was told in India, to his pain,<BR>
That she Orlando followed to the west.<BR>
He after learned in France that Charlemagne<BR>
Secluded from that champion and the rest,<BR>
As a fit guerdon, mewed her for the knight<BR>
Who should protect the lilies best in fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
The warrior in the field had been, and viewed,<BR>
Short time before, king Charlemagne&#8217;s disgrace;<BR>
And vainly had Angelica pursued,<BR>
Nor of the damsel&#8217;s footsteps found a trace.<BR>
And this is what the weeping monarch rued,<BR>
And this he so bewailed in doleful case:<BR>
Hence, into words his lamentations run,<BR>
Which might for pity stop the passing sun.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
While Sacripant laments him in this plight,<BR>
And makes a tepid fountain of his eyes;<BR>
And, what I deem not needful to recite,<BR>
Pours forth yet other plaints and piteous cries;<BR>
Propitious Fortune will his lady bright<BR>
Should hear the youth lament him in such wise:<BR>
And thus a moment compassed what, without<BR>
Such chance, long ages had not brought about.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
With deep attention, while the warrior weeps,<BR>
She marks the fashion of the grief and tears<BR>
And words of him, whose passion never sleeps;<BR>
Nor this the first confession which she hears.<BR>
But with his plaint her heart no measure keeps,<BR>
Cold as the column which the builder rears.<BR>
Like haughty maid, who holds herself above<BR>
The world, and deems none worthy of her love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
But her from harm amid those woods to keep,<BR>
The damsel weened she might his guidance need;<BR>
For the poor drowning caitiff, who, chin-deep,<BR>
Implores not help, is obstinate indeed.<BR>
Nor will she, if she let the occasion sleep,<BR>
Find escort that will stand her in such stead:<BR>
For she that king by long experience knew<BR>
Above all other lovers, kind and true.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
But not the more for this the maid intends<BR>
To heal the mischief which her charms had wrought,<BR>
And for past ills to furnish glad amends<BR>
In that full bliss by pining lover sought.<BR>
To keep the king in play are all her ends,<BR>
His help by some device or fiction bought,<BR>
And having to her purpose taxed his daring,<BR>
To reassume as wont her haughty bearing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
An apparition bright and unforeseen,<BR>
She stood like Venus or Diana fair,<BR>
In solemn pageant, issuing on the scene<BR>
From out of shadowy wood or murky lair.<BR>
And &#8220;Peace be with you,&#8221; cried the youthful queen,<BR>
&#8220;And God preserve my honour in his care,<BR>
Nor suffer that you blindly entertain<BR>
Opinion of my fame so false and vain!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Not with such wonderment a mother eyes,<BR>
With such excessive bliss the son she mourned<BR>
As dead, lamented still with tears and sighs,<BR>
Since the thinned files without her boy returned.<BR>
&#8212;Not such her rapture as the king&#8217;s surprise<BR>
And ecstasy of joy when he discerned<BR>
The lofty presence, cheeks of heavenly hue,<BR>
And lovely form which broke upon his view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
He, full of fond and eager passion, pressed<BR>
Towards his Lady, his Divinity;<BR>
And she now clasped the warrior to her breast,<BR>
Who in Cat&agrave;y had haply been less free.<BR>
And now again the maid her thoughts addressed<BR>
Towards her native land and empery:<BR>
And feels, with hope revived, her bosom beat<BR>
Shortly to repossess her sumptuous seat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Her chances all to him the damsel said,<BR>
Since he was eastward sent to Sericane<BR>
By her to seek the martial monarch&#8217;s aid,<BR>
Who swayed the sceptre of that fair domain;<BR>
And told how oft Orlando&#8217;s friendly blade<BR>
Had saved her from dishonour, death, and pain;<BR>
And how she so preserved her virgin flower<BR>
Pure as it blossomed in her natal hour.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Haply the tale was true; yet will not seem<BR>
Likely to one of sober sense possessed:<BR>
But Sacripant, who waked from worser dream,<BR>
In all without a cavil acquiesced:<BR>
Since love, who sees without one guiding gleam,<BR>
Spies in broad day but that which likes him best:<BR>
For one sign of the afflicted man&#8217;s disease<BR>
Is to give ready faith to things which please.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If good Anglante&#8217;s lord the prize forbore,<BR>
Nor seized the fair occasion when he might,<BR>
The loss be his, if Fortune never more<BR>
Him to enjoy so fair a prize invite.<BR>
To imitate that lord of little lore<BR>
I think not,&#8221; said, apart, Circassa&#8217;s knight.<BR>
&#8220;To quit such proffered good, and, to my shame,<BR>
Have but myself on after-thought to blame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No! I will pluck the fresh and morning rose,<BR>
Which, should I tarry, may be overblown.<BR>
To woman, (this my own experience shows),<BR>
No deed more sweet or welcome can be done.<BR>
Then, whatsoever scorn the damsel shows,<BR>
Though she awhile may weep and make her moan,<BR>
I will, unchecked by anger, false or true,<BR>
Or sharp repulse, my bold design pursue.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
This said, he for the soft assault prepares,<BR>
When a loud noise within the greenwood shade<BR>
Beside him, rang in his astounded ears,<BR>
And sore against his will the monarch stayed.<BR>
He donned his helm (his other arms he wears),<BR>
Aye wont to rove in steel, with belted blade,<BR>
Replaced the bridle on his courser fleet,<BR>
Grappled his lance, and sprang into his seat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
With the bold semblance of a valiant knight,<BR>
Behold a warrior threads the forest hoar.<BR>
The stranger&#8217;s mantle was of snowy white,<BR>
And white alike the waving plume he wore.<BR>
Balked of his bliss, and full of fell despite,<BR>
The monarch ill the interruption bore,<BR>
And spurred his horse to meet him in mid space,<BR>
With hate and fury glowing in his face.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Him he defies to fight, approaching nigh,<BR>
And weens to make him stoop his haughty crest:<BR>
The other knight, whose worth I rate as high,<BR>
His warlike prowess puts to present test;<BR>
Cuts short his haughty threats and angry cry,<BR>
And spurs, and lays his levelled lance in rest.<BR>
In tempest wheels Circassia&#8217;s valiant peer,<BR>
And at his foeman&#8217;s head each aims his spear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Not brindled bulls or tawny lions spring<BR>
To forest warfare with such deadly will<BR>
As those two knights, the stranger and the king.<BR>
Their spears alike the opposing bucklers thrill:<BR>
The solid ground, at their encountering,<BR>
Trembles from fruitful vale to naked hill:<BR>
And well it was the mail in which they dressed<BR>
Their bodies was of proof, and saved the breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Nor swerved the chargers from their destined course;<BR>
Who met like rams, and butted head to head.<BR>
The warlike Saracen&#8217;s ill-fated horse,<BR>
Well valued while alive, dropt short and dead:<BR>
The stranger&#8217;s, too, fell senseless; but perforce<BR>
Was roused by rowel from his grassy bed.<BR>
That of the paynim king, extended straight,<BR>
Lay on his battered lord with all his weight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Upright upon his steed, the knight unknown,<BR>
Who at the encounter horse and rider threw,<BR>
Deeming enough was in the conflict done,<BR>
Cares not the worthless warfare to renew;<BR>
But endlong by the readiest path is gone,<BR>
And measures, pricking frith and forest through,<BR>
A mile, or little less, in furious heat,<BR>
Ere the foiled Saracen regains his feet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
As the bewildered and astonished clown<BR>
Who held the plough (the thunder storm o&#8217;erpast)<BR>
There, where the deafening bolt had beat him down,<BR>
Nigh his death-stricken cattle, wakes aghast,<BR>
And sees the distant pine without its crown,<BR>
Which he saw clad in leafy honours last;<BR>
So rose the paynim knight with troubled face,<BR>
The maid spectatress of the cruel case.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
He sighs and groans, yet not for mischief sore<BR>
Endured in wounded arm or foot which bled;<BR>
But for mere shame, and never such before<BR>
Or after, dyed his cheek so deep a red,<BR>
And if he rued his fall, it grieved him more<BR>
His dame should lift him from his courser dead.<BR>
He speechless had remained, I ween, if she<BR>
Had not his prisoned tongue and voice set free.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Grieve not,&#8221; she said, &#8220;sir monarch, for thy fall;<BR>
But let the blame upon thy courser be!<BR>
To whom more welcome had been forage, stall,<BR>
And rest, than further joust and jeopardy;<BR>
And well thy foe the loser may I call,<BR>
(Who shall no glory gain) for such is he<BR>
Who is the first to quit his ground, if aught<BR>
Angelica of fighting fields be taught.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
While she so seeks the Saracen to cheer,<BR>
Behold a messenger with pouch and horn,<BR>
On panting hackney!&#8212;man and horse appear<BR>
With the long journey, weary and forlorn.<BR>
He questions Sacripant, approaching near,<BR>
Had he seen warrior pass, by whom were borne<BR>
A shield and crest of white; in search of whom<BR>
Through the wide forest pricked the weary groom.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
King Sacripant made answer, &#8220;As you see,<BR>
He threw me here, and went but now his way:<BR>
Then tell the warrior&#8217;s name, that I may be<BR>
Informed whose valour foiled me in the fray.&#8221;<BR>
To him the groom,&#8212;&#8220;That which you ask of me<BR>
I shall relate to you without delay:<BR>
Know that you were in combat prostrate laid<BR>
By the tried valour of a gentle maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Bold is the maid; but fairer yet than bold,<BR>
Nor the redoubted virgin&#8217;s name I veil:<BR>
&#8217;Twas Bradamant who marred what praise of old<BR>
Your prowess ever won with sword and mail.&#8221;<BR>
This said, he spurred again, his story told,<BR>
And left him little gladdened by the tale.<BR>
He recks not what he says or does, for shame,<BR>
And his flushed visage kindles into flame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
After the woeful warrior long had thought<BR>
Upon his cruel case, and still in vain,<BR>
And found a woman his defeat had wrought,<BR>
For thinking but increased the monarch&#8217;s pain,<BR>
He climbed the other horse, nor spake he aught;<BR>
But silently uplifted from the plain,<BR>
Upon the croup bestowed that damsel sweet,<BR>
Reserved to gladder use in safer seat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Two miles they had not rode before they hear<BR>
The sweeping woods which spread about them, sound<BR>
With such loud crash and trample, far and near,<BR>
The forest seemed to tremble all around;<BR>
And shortly after see a steed appear,<BR>
With housings wrought in gold and richly bound;<BR>
Who clears the bush and stream, with furious force<BR>
And whatsoever else impedes his course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Unless the misty air,&#8221; the damsel cries,<BR>
&#8220;And boughs deceive my sight, yon noble steed<BR>
Is, sure, Bayardo, who before us flies,<BR>
And parts the wood with such impetuous speed.<BR>
&#8212;Yes, &#8217;tis Bayardo&#8217;s self I recognize.<BR>
How well the courser understands our need!<BR>
Two riders ill a foundered jade would bear,<BR>
But hither speeds the horse to end that care.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
The bold Circassian lighted, and applied<BR>
His hand to seize him by the flowing rein,<BR>
Who, swiftly turning, with his heels replied,<BR>
For he like lightning wheeled upon the plain.<BR>
Woe to the king! but that he leaps aside,<BR>
For should he smite, he would not lash in vain.<BR>
Such are his bone and sinew, that the shock<BR>
Of his good heels had split a metal rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Then to the maid he goes submissively,<BR>
With gentle blandishment and humble mood;<BR>
As the dog greets his lord with frolic glee,<BR>
Whom, some short season past, he had not viewed.<BR>
For good Bayardo had in memory<BR>
Albracca, where her hands prepared his food,<BR>
What time the damsel loved Rinaldo bold;<BR>
Rinaldo, then ungrateful, stern, and cold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
With her left hand she takes him by the bit,<BR>
And with the other pats his sides and chest:<BR>
While the good steed (so marvellous his wit),<BR>
Lamb-like, obeyed the damsel and caressed.<BR>
Meantime the king, who sees the moment fit,<BR>
Leapt up, and with his knees the courser pressed.<BR>
While on the palfrey, eased of half his weight,<BR>
The lady left the croup, and gained the seat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Then, as at hazard, she directs her sight,<BR>
Sounding in arms a man on foot espies,<BR>
And glows with sudden anger and despite;<BR>
For she in him the son of Aymon eyes.<BR>
Her more than life esteems the youthful knight,<BR>
While she from him, like crane from falcon, flies.<BR>
Time was the lady sighed, her passion slighted;<BR>
&#8217;Tis now Rinaldo loves, as ill requited.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
And this effect two different fountains wrought,<BR>
Whose wonderous waters different moods inspire.<BR>
Both spring in Arden, with rare virtue fraught:<BR>
This fills the heart with amorous desire:<BR>
Who taste that other fountain are untaught<BR>
Their love, and change for ice their former fire.<BR>
Rinaldo drank the first, and vainly sighs;<BR>
Angelica the last, and hates and flies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Mixed with such secret bane the waters glide,<BR>
Which amorous care convert to sudden hate;<BR>
The maid no sooner had Rinaldo spied,<BR>
Than on her laughing eyes deep darkness sate:<BR>
And with sad mien and trembling voice she cried<BR>
To Sacripant, and prayed him not to wait<BR>
The near approach of the detested knight,<BR>
But through the wood with her pursue his flight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
To her the Saracen, with anger hot:<BR>
&#8220;Is knightly worship sunk so low in me,<BR>
That thou should&#8217;st hold my valour cheap, and not<BR>
Sufficient to make yonder champion flee?<BR>
Already are Albracca&#8217;s fights forgot,<BR>
And that dread night I singly stood for thee?<BR>
That night when I, though naked, was thy shield<BR>
Against King Agrican and all his field?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
She answers not, and knows not in her fear<BR>
What &#8217;tis she does; Rinaldo is too nigh:<BR>
And from afar that furious cavalier<BR>
Threats the bold Saracen with angry cry,<BR>
As soon as the known steed and damsel dear,<BR>
Whose charms such flame had kindled, meet his eye.<BR>
But what ensued between the haughty pair<BR>
I in another canto shall declare.</TD></TR>
