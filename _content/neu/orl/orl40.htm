<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
To fly the royal Agramant is fain,<BR>
And sees Biserta burning far away;<BR>
But landing finds the royal Sericane,<BR>
Who of his faith gives goodly warrant; they<BR>
Defy Orlando, backed by champions twain;<BR>
Whom bold Gradasso firmly trusts to slay.<BR>
For seven kings&#8217; sake, fast prisoners to their foes,<BR>
Rogero and the Dane exchange rude blows.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
The diverse chances of that sea-fight dread,<BR>
Here to rehearse would take a weary while;<BR>
And to discourse to you upon this head,<BR>
Great son of Hercules, were to Samos&#8217; isle<BR>
To carry earthen vessels, as &#8217;tis said,<BR>
To Athens owls, and crocodiles the Nile.<BR>
In that, my lord, by what is vouched to me,<BR>
Such things you saw, such things made others see.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Your faithful people gazed on a long show,<BR>
That night and day, wherein they crowded stood,<BR>
As in a theatre, and hemmed on Po<BR>
Twixt fire and sword, the hostile navies viewed.<BR>
What outcries may be heard, what sounds of woe,<BR>
How rivers may run red with human blood,<BR>
In suchlike combat, in how many a mode<BR>
Men die, you saw, and you to many showed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
I saw not, I, who was compelled to course,<BR>
Evermore changing nags, six days before,<BR>
To Rome, in heat and haste, some helpful force<BR>
Of him our mighty pastor to implore.<BR>
But, after, need was none of foot or horse,<BR>
For so the lion&#8217;s beak and claws you tore,<BR>
From that day unto this I hear not said<BR>
That he more trouble in your land has bread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
But Trotto, present at this victory,<BR>
Afranio, Moro, Albert, Hannibal,<BR>
Zerbinat, Bagno, the Ariostos three,<BR>
Assured me of the mighty feat withal,<BR>
Certified after by that ensignry,<BR>
Suspended from the holy temple&#8217;s wall,<BR>
And fifteen galleys at our river-side,<BR>
Which with a thousand captive barks I spied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
He that those wrecks and blazing fires discerned,<BR>
And such sore slaughter, under different shows,<BR>
Which&#8212;venging us for hall and palace burned&#8212;<BR>
While bark remained, raged wide among the foes,<BR>
Might also deem how Africk&#8217;s people mourned,<BR>
With Agramant, mid diverse deaths and woes,<BR>
On that dark night, when the redouted Dane<BR>
Assaulted in mid sea the Moorish train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas night, nor gleam was anywhere descried,<BR>
When first the fleets in furious strife were blended;<BR>
But when lit sulphur, pitch and tar from side<BR>
And poop and prow into the sky ascended,<BR>
And the destructive wild-fire, scattered wide,<BR>
Fed upon ship and shallop ill defended,<BR>
The things about them all descried so clear<BR>
That night was changed to day, as &#8217;twould appear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Hence Agramant, that by the dark deceived,<BR>
Had rated not so high the foes&#8217; array,<BR>
Nor to encounter such a force believed,<BR>
But would, if &#8217;twere opposed, at last give way,<BR>
When that wide darkness cleared, and he perceived<BR>
(What least he weened upon the first affray)<BR>
That twice as many were the ships he fought,<BR>
As his own Moorish barks, took other thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Into a boat he with some few descends,<BR>
Brigliador and some precious things, to flee;<BR>
And so, twixt ship and ship, in silence wends,<BR>
Until he finds himself in safer sea,<BR>
Far from his own; whom fiery Dudon shends,<BR>
Reduced to sad and sore extremity;<BR>
Them steel destroys, fires burn, and waters drown;<BR>
While he, that mighty slaughter&#8217;s cause, is flown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Agramant flies, and with him old Sobrine,<BR>
Agramant grieving he had not believed,<BR>
What time that sage foresaw with eye divine,<BR>
And told the woe wherewith he is aggrieved.<BR>
But turn me to the valiant paladine,<BR>
Who, before other aid can be received,<BR>
Counsels the duke Biserta to destroy;<BR>
That it no more may Christian France annoy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
And hence in public order was it said,<BR>
The camp should to its arms the third day stand;<BR>
For this, it was with many barks bested;<BR>
For all were placed not at the Dane&#8217;s command.<BR>
That fleet the worthy Sansonetto led,<BR>
(As good a warrior he by sea as land)<BR>
Which a mile off the port, and overight<BR>
Biserta, now was anchored by the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Orlando and the duke, like Christians true,<BR>
Which dare no danger without God for guide,<BR>
That fast and prayer be made their army through,<BR>
Ordain by proclamation to be cried;<BR>
And that upon the third day, when they view<BR>
The signal, all shall bown them, far and wide,<BR>
Biserta&#8217;s royal city to attack,<BR>
Which they, when taken, doom to fire and sack.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
And so, when now devoutly have been done<BR>
Vigil and vow, and holy prayer and fast,<BR>
Kin, friends, and those to one another known,<BR>
Together feast; who, when with glad repast<BR>
Their wasted bodies were refreshed, begun<BR>
To embrace and weep; and acts and speeches past,<BR>
Upon the banquet&#8217;s close, amid those crews<BR>
Such as best friends, about to sever, use.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
The holy priests within Biserta&#8217;s wall,<BR>
Pray with their grieving people, and in tears,<BR>
Aye beat their bosoms, and for succour call<BR>
Upon their Mahomet, who nothing hears.<BR>
What vigils, offerings, and what gifts withal<BR>
Were promised silently, amid their fears!<BR>
What temples, statues, images were vowed,<BR>
In memory of their bitter woes, aloud!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
And, when the cadi hath his blessing said,<BR>
The people arms and to the rampart hies.<BR>
As yet reposing in her Tithon&#8217;s bed<BR>
Aurora was, and dusky were the skies;<BR>
When to their posts, their several troops to head,<BR>
Here Sansonetto, there Astolpho flies.<BR>
And when they hear Orlando&#8217;s signal blown<BR>
Assault with furious force Biserta&#8217;s town.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Washed by the sea, upon two quarters, were<BR>
The city walls, two stood on the dry shore,<BR>
Of a construction excellent and rare,<BR>
Wherein was seen the work of days of yore:<BR>
Of other bulwarks was the town nigh bare;<BR>
For since Branzardo there the sceptre bore;<BR>
Few masons at command, and little space<BR>
That monarch had to fortify the place.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
The Nubian king is charged by England&#8217;s peer,<BR>
With sling and arrow so the Moors to gall,<BR>
That none upon the works shall dare appear;<BR>
And that, protected by the ceaseless fall<BR>
Of stone and dart, in safety cavalier<BR>
And footman may approach the very wall;<BR>
Who loaded, some with plank, with rock-stone some,<BR>
And some with beam, or weightier burden, come.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
This and that other thing the Nubians bore,<BR>
And by degrees filled-up that channel wide,<BR>
Whose waters were cut off the day before,<BR>
So that in many parts the ooze was spied.<BR>
Filled is the ditch in haste from shore to shore,<BR>
And forms a level to the further side.<BR>
Cheering the footmen on the works to mount,<BR>
Stand Olivier, Astolpho, and the Count.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The Nubian upon hope of gain intent,<BR>
Impatient of delay, nor heeding how<BR>
With pressing perils they were compassed, went<BR>
Protected by the sheltering boar and sow.<BR>
With battering ram, and other instrument,<BR>
To break the gate and make the turret bow,<BR>
Speedily to the city wall they post,<BR>
Nor unprovided find the paynim host.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
For steel, and fire, and roof, and turret there,<BR>
In guise of tempest on the Nubians fell,<BR>
Which plank and beam from those dread engines tear,<BR>
Made for annoyance of the infidel.<BR>
In the ill beginning, and while dim the air,<BR>
Much injury the christened host befell;<BR>
But when the sun from his rich mansion breaks,<BR>
Fortune the faction of the Moor forsakes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
The assault is reinforced on every side,<BR>
By Count Orlando, both by sea and land:<BR>
The fleet, with Sansonetto for its guide,<BR>
Entered the harbour, and approached the strand;<BR>
And sorely they with various engines plied,<BR>
With arrows and with slings, the paynim band;<BR>
And sent the assailants scaling-ladder, spear,<BR>
And naval stores, and every needful gear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
Orlando, Oliviero, Brandimart,<BR>
And he, in air so daring heretofore,<BR>
Do fierce and furious battle on that part,<BR>
Which lies the furthest inland from the shore:<BR>
Each leads a portion of those Aethiops swart,<BR>
Ordered in equal bands beneath the four,<BR>
Who at the walls, the gateways, or elsewhere,<BR>
All give of prowess shining proofs and rare.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
So better could be seen each warrior&#8217;s claim,<BR>
That in confused in combat there and here.<BR>
Who of reward is worthy, who of shame,<BR>
To a thousand and to watchful eyes is clear.<BR>
Dragged upon wheels are towers of wooden frame,<BR>
And others well-trained elephants uprear,<BR>
Which so o&#8217;ertop the turrets of the foe,<BR>
Those bulwarks stand a mighty space below.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Brandimart to the walls a ladder brought,<BR>
Climbed, and to climb withal to others cried:<BR>
Many succeed, with bold assurance fraught,<BR>
For none can fear beneath so good a guide:<BR>
Nor was there one who marked, nor one who thought<BR>
Of marking, if such weight it would abide.<BR>
Brandimart only, on the foes intent,<BR>
Clambered and fought, and grasped a battlement.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Here clang with hand and foot the daring knight,<BR>
Sprang on the embattled wall, and whirled his sword;<BR>
And, showing mickle tokens of his might,<BR>
The paynims charged, o&#8217;erthrew, hewed down and gored:<BR>
But all at once, o&#8217;erburthened with that weight,<BR>
The ladder breaks beneath the assailing horde;<BR>
And, saving Brandimart, the Christians all<BR>
Into the ditch with headlong ruin fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Not therefore blenched the valiant cavalier,<BR>
Nor thought he of retreat, albeit was none<BR>
Of his own band that followed in his rear;<BR>
Although he was a mark for all the town.<BR>
Of many prayed, the warrior would not hear<BR>
The prayer to turn; but mid the foes leapt down;<BR>
I say, into the city took a leap,<BR>
Where the town-wall was thirty cubits deep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
He, without any harm on the hard ground,<BR>
As if on feathers or on straw, did light;<BR>
And, like cloth shred and shorn, the paynims round<BR>
In fury shreds and shears the valiant knight.<BR>
Now springs on these, now those, with vigorous bound;<BR>
And these and those betake themselves to flight.<BR>
They that without have seen the leap he made,<BR>
Too late to save him deem all human aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Throughout the squadrons a deep rumour flew,<BR>
A murmur and a whisper, there and here,<BR>
From mouth to mouth, the Fame by motion grew,<BR>
And told and magnified the tale of fear:<BR>
For upon many quarters stormed that crew,<BR>
Where good Orlando was, where Olivier,<BR>
Where Otho&#8217;s son, she flew on pinions light,<BR>
Nor ever paused upon her nimble flight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Those warriors, and Orlando most of all,<BR>
Who love and prize the gentle Brandimart,<BR>
Hearing, should they defy upon that call,<BR>
They would from so renowned a comrade part,<BR>
Their scaling-ladders plant, and mount the wall<BR>
With rivalry, which shows the kingly heart;<BR>
Who carry all such terror in their look,<BR>
That, at the very sight, their foemen shook.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
As on loud ocean, lashed by boisterous gale<BR>
The billows the rash bark assault, and still&#8212;<BR>
Now threatening poop, now threatening prow&#8212;assail,<BR>
And, in their rage and fury, fain would fill;<BR>
The pilot sighs and groans, dismaid and pale,<BR>
&#8212;He that should aid, and has not heart or skill&#8212;<BR>
At length a surge the pinnace sweeps and swallows,<BR>
And wave on wave in long succession follows;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Thus when those win the wall, they leave a space<BR>
So wide, that who beneath their conduct go,<BR>
Safely may follow them; for at its base,<BR>
A thousand ladders have been reared below.<BR>
Meanwhile the battering rams, in many a place,<BR>
Have breached that wall, and with such mighty blow,<BR>
The bold assailant can, from many a part,<BR>
Bear succour to the gallant Brandimart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Even with that rage wherewith the stream that reigns,<BR>
The king of rivers&#8212;when he breaks his mound,<BR>
And makes himself a way through Mantuan plains&#8212;<BR>
The greasy furrows and glad harvests, round,<BR>
And, with the sheepcotes, flock, and dogs and swains<BR>
Bears off, in his o&#8217;erwhelming waters drowned;<BR>
Over the elm&#8217;s high top the fishes glide,<BR>
Where fowls erewhile their nimble pinions plied;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Even with that rage rushed in the impetuous band,<BR>
Where many breaches in the wall were wrought,<BR>
To slay with burning torch and trenchant brand,<BR>
That people, which to evil pass were brought.<BR>
Murder and rapine there, and violent hand<BR>
Dipt deep in blood and plunder, in a thought,<BR>
Destroy that sumptuous and triumphant town,<BR>
Which of all Africk wore the royal crown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
Filled with dead bodies of the paynim horde,<BR>
Blood issued from so many a gaping wound,<BR>
A fouler fosse was formed and worse to ford<BR>
Than girdles the infernal city round.<BR>
From house to house the fire in fury poured;<BR>
Mosque, portico, and palace, went to ground;<BR>
And spoiled and empty mansions with the clang,<BR>
Of beaten breast, and groan and outcry rang.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
The victors, laden with their mighty prey,<BR>
From that unhappy city&#8217;s gates are gone,<BR>
One with fair vase, and one with rich array,<BR>
Or silver plate from ancient altar won.<BR>
The mother this, that bore the child away;<BR>
Rapes and a thousand evil things were done.<BR>
Of much, and what they cannot hinder, hear<BR>
Renowned Orlando and fair England&#8217;s peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
By Olivier, amid that slaughter wide,<BR>
Fell Bucifaro of the paynim band;<BR>
And&#8212;every hope and comfort cast aside&#8212;<BR>
Branzardo slew himself with his own brand;<BR>
Pierced with three wounds whereof he shortly died,<BR>
Folvo was taken by Astolpho&#8217;s hand;<BR>
The monarchs three, intrusted to whose care<BR>
Agramant&#8217;s African dominions were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Agramant, who had left without a guide<BR>
His fleet this while, and with Sobrino fled,<BR>
Wept over his Biserta when he spied<BR>
Those fires that on the royal city fed.<BR>
When nearer now the king was certified,<BR>
How in that cruel strife his town had sped,<BR>
He thought of dying, and himself had slain,<BR>
But that Sobrino&#8217;s words his arm restrain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What victory, my lord,&#8221; (Sobrino cries)<BR>
&#8220;Could better than thy death the Christian cheer,<BR>
Whence he might hope to joy in quiet wise<BR>
Fair Africa, from all annoyance clear?<BR>
Thy being yet alive this hope denies;<BR>
Hence shall he evermore have cause for fear.<BR>
For well the foeman knows, save thou art gone,<BR>
He for short time will fill thine Africk throne.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thy subjects by thy death deprived will be<BR>
Of hope, the only good they have in store,<BR>
Thou, if thou liv&#8217;st, I trust, shalt set us free,<BR>
Redeem from trouble, and to joy restore.<BR>
Captives for ever, if thou diest, are we;<BR>
Africk is tributary evermore.<BR>
Although not for thyself, yet not to give<BR>
My liege, annoyance to thy followers, live.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The soldan, he thy neighbour, will be won,<BR>
Surely with men and money thee to aid:<BR>
By him with evil eye King Pepin&#8217;s son,<BR>
So strong in Africa, will be surveyed.<BR>
All efforts to restore thee to thy throne<BR>
By Norandine, thy kinsman, will be made.<BR>
Turk, Persian and Armenian, Arab, Mede,<BR>
If prayed, will all assist thee in thy need.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
In such and such like words, with wary art,<BR>
With hope of quickly winning back his reign,<BR>
Sobrino soothed the king, while in his heart<BR>
He other thought perchance did entertain.<BR>
Well knows he to what pass, what evil mart<BR>
That lord is brought; how often sighs in vain,<BR>
Whoe&#8217;er foregoes the sceptre which he swayed,<BR>
And to barbarians hath recourse for aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
Jugurtha, martial Hannibal, and more<BR>
In ancient times, good proof of this afford:<BR>
In our own era, Lewis, hight the Moor,<BR>
Delivered into other Lewis&#8217; ward.<BR>
Your brother, Duke Alphonso, wiser lore<BR>
Learned from their fate;&#8212;I speak to you, my lord&#8212;<BR>
Wont them as very madmen to decry,<BR>
That more on others than themselves rely;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
And therefore aye, throughout that warfare drear<BR>
Waged by the pontiff, in his fierce disdain,<BR>
Albeit upon his feeble powers the peer<BR>
Could ill depend, though from Italian plain<BR>
Was driven the friend that aided him whilere,<BR>
And by the foe possessed was Naples&#8217; reign,<BR>
He against menace, against promise steeled,<BR>
Ne&#8217;er to another would his dukedom yield.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
Eastward King Agramant had turned his prow;<BR>
And seaward steered his bark, of Africk wide;<BR>
When from the land a wicked wind &#8217;gan blow,<BR>
And took the reeling vessel on one side:<BR>
The master, seated at the helm, his brow<BR>
Raised towards heaven, and to the monarch cried:<BR>
&#8220;I see so fell and fierce a tempest form,<BR>
Our pinnace cannot face the pelting storm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If you, my lords, will listen to my lore,<BR>
An isle is on our left-hand; and to me<BR>
It seems that it were well to make that shore<BR>
Till overblown the tempest&#8217;s fury be.&#8221;<BR>
To his advice assents the royal Moor,<BR>
And makes the larboard land, from peril free;<BR>
Which, for the sailor&#8217;s weal, when tempests rise,<BR>
&#8217;Twixt Vulcan&#8217;s lofty forge and Africk lies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
With juniper and myrtle overgrown,<BR>
Of habitations is that islet bare;<BR>
A pleasing solitude; and where alone<BR>
Harbour wild stag and roebuck, deer and hare;<BR>
And, save to fishermen, is little known,<BR>
That oftentimes on the shorn brambles there<BR>
Hang their moist nets; meanwhile, untroubled sleep<BR>
The scaly fishes in their quiet deep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Here other vessel, sheltered from the main,<BR>
They found, by tempest tost upon that land,<BR>
Which had conveyed the king of Sericane<BR>
Erewhile from Arles; on one and the other hand,<BR>
In reverent wise and worthy of the twain,<BR>
Those valiant kings embraced upon the strand:<BR>
For friends the monarchs were, and late before<BR>
The walls of Paris, arms together bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
With much displeasure Sericana&#8217;s knight<BR>
Heard by King Agramant his griefs displaid;<BR>
Then him consoled, and in his cause to fight,<BR>
Like courteous king, the kindly offer made:<BR>
But brooked nat, that to Egypt&#8217;s people, light<BR>
And lacking faith, he should resort for aid.<BR>
&#8220;That thither it is perilous to wend,<BR>
Exiles (he said) are warned by Pompey&#8217;s end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And for Senapus&#8217; Aethiopian crew<BR>
Have come beneath Astolpho, as ye show,<BR>
To wrest your fruitful Africa from you,<BR>
And burnt and laid her chiefest city low.<BR>
And with their squadrons is Orlando, who<BR>
Was wandering void of wit, short while ago,<BR>
The fittest cure for all, whereby to scape<BR>
Out of this trouble I, meseems, can shape.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I, for your love, will undertake the quest,<BR>
The Count in single combat to appear;<BR>
He vainly would, I wot, with me contest,<BR>
If wholly made of copper or of steel.<BR>
I rate the Christian church, were he at rest,<BR>
As wolf rates lambs, when hungering for his meal.<BR>
Next have I thought how of the Nubian band<BR>
&#8212;A brief and easy task&#8212;to free your land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I will make other Nubians, they that hold<BR>
Another faith, divided by Nile&#8217;s course,<BR>
And Arabs and Macrobians (rich in gold<BR>
And men are these, and those in herds of horse),<BR>
Chaldaean, Perse, and many more, controlled<BR>
By my good sceptre, in such mighty force,<BR>
Will make them war upon the Nubians&#8217; reign,<BR>
Those reavers shall not in your land remain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
Gradasso&#8217;s second offer seemed to be<BR>
Most opportune to King Troyano&#8217;s son;<BR>
And much he blest the chances of the sea,<BR>
Which him upon that desert isle had thrown:<BR>
Yet would not upon any pact agree,<BR>
&#8212;Nay, not to repossess Biserta&#8217;s town&#8212;<BR>
Gradasso should for him in fight contend;<BR>
Deeming too sore his honour &#8217;twould offend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If Roland is to be defied, more due<BR>
The battle is to me (that king replies)<BR>
I am prepared for it; and let God do<BR>
His will by me, in good or evil wise.&#8221;<BR>
&#8220;&#8212;Follow my mode; another mode and new,<BR>
Which comes into my mind&#8221; (Gradasso cries),<BR>
&#8220;Let both of us together wage this fight<BR>
Against Orlando and another knight.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So not left out, I care not, if I be<BR>
The first or last (said Agramant): I know<BR>
In arms no better can I find than thee,<BR>
Though I should seek a comrade, high or low,<BR>
And what (Sobrino cried) becomes of me?<BR>
I should be more expert if old in show;<BR>
And evermore in peril it is good,<BR>
Force should have Counsel in his neighbourhood.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Stricken in years, yet vigorous was the sage,<BR>
And well had proved himself with sword and spear;<BR>
And said, he found himself in gray old age,<BR>
Such as in green and supple youth whilere.<BR>
They own his claim, and for an embassage<BR>
Forthwith a courier find, then bid him steer<BR>
For Africa, where camped the Christians lie,<BR>
And Count Orlando on their part defy;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
With equal number of armed knights to be,<BR>
Matching his foes, on Lampedosa&#8217;s shore;<BR>
Where on all quarters that circumfluent sea,<BR>
By which they are inisled, is heard to roar.<BR>
The paynim messenger unceasingly,<BR>
Like one in needful haste, used sail and oar,<BR>
Till he found Roland in Biserta, where<BR>
The host beneath his eye their plunder share.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
From those three monarchs to the cavalier<BR>
The invitation was in public told;<BR>
So pleasing to Anglante&#8217;s valiant peer,<BR>
To the herald he was liberal of his gold:<BR>
From his companions had he heard whilere<BR>
That Durindane was in Gradasso&#8217;s hold:<BR>
Hence, to retrieve that faulchion from the foe,<BR>
To India had the Count resolved to go:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
Deeming he should not find that king elsewhere,<BR>
Who, so he heard, had sailed from the French shore.<BR>
A nearer place is offered now; and there<BR>
He hopes Gradasso shall his prize restore;<BR>
Moved also by Almontes&#8217; bugle rare,<BR>
To accept the challenge which the herald bore;<BR>
Nor less by Brigliadoro; since he knew<BR>
In Agramant&#8217;s possession were the two.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
He chose for his companions in the fight<BR>
The faithful Brandimart and Olivier:<BR>
Well has he proved the one and the other&#8217;s might;<BR>
Knows he alike to both is passing dear.<BR>
Good horses and good armour seeks the knight<BR>
And goodly swords and lances, far and near,<BR>
For him and his; meseems to you is known<BR>
How none of those three warriors had his own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
Orlando (as I oft have certified)<BR>
In fury, his had scattered wide and far;<BR>
Rodomont took the others&#8217;, which beside<BR>
The river, locked in that high turret are.<BR>
Few throughout Africa could they provide;<BR>
As well because to France, in that long war,<BR>
King Agramant had born away the best,<BR>
As because Africa but few possest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
What could be had of armour, rusted o&#8217;er<BR>
And brown with age, Orlando bids unite;<BR>
Meanwhile with his companions on the shore,<BR>
He walks, discoursing on the future fight.<BR>
So wandering from their camp three miles and more,<BR>
It chanced that, turning towards the sea their sight,<BR>
Under full sail approaching, they descried<BR>
A helmless barque, with nought her course to guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
She, without pilot, without crew, alone,<BR>
As wind and fortune ordered it, was bound:<BR>
The vessel neared the shore, with sails full-blown,<BR>
Furrowing the waves, until she took the ground.<BR>
But ere of these three warriors more be shown,<BR>
The love wherewith I to the Child am bound,<BR>
To his story brings me back, and bids record<BR>
What past &#8217;twixt him and Clermont&#8217;s warlike lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
I spake of that good pair of warriors, who<BR>
Had both retreated from the martial fray,<BR>
Beholding pact and treaty broken through,<BR>
And every troop and band in disarray.<BR>
Which leader to his oath was first untrue,<BR>
And was occasion of such evil, they<BR>
Study to learn of all the passing train;<BR>
King Agramant or the Emperor Charlemagne.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Meanwhile a servant of the Child&#8217;s, at hand,<BR>
&#8212;Faithful, expert and wary was the wight,<BR>
Nor in the shock of either furious band,<BR>
Had ever of his warlike lord lost sight&#8212;<BR>
To bold Rogero bore his horse and brand,<BR>
That he might aid his comrades now in flight.<BR>
Rogero backed the steed and grasped the sword;<BR>
But not in battle mixed that martial lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Thence he departed; but he first renewed<BR>
His compact with Montalban&#8217;s knight&#8212;that so<BR>
His Agramant convinced of perjury stood&#8212;<BR>
Him and his evil sect he would forego.<BR>
That day no further feats of hardihood<BR>
Rogero will perform against the foe:<BR>
He but demands of all that make for Arles,<BR>
Who first broke faith, King Agramant or Charles?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
From all he hears repeated, far and near,<BR>
That Agramant had broke the promise plight:<BR>
He loves that king, and from his side to veer,<BR>
For this, believes would be no error light.<BR>
The Moors were broke and scattered (this whilere<BR>
Has been rehearsed) and from the giddy height<BR>
Of HER revolving wheel were downward hurled,<BR>
Who at her pleasure rolls this nether world.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Rogero ponders if he should remain,<BR>
Or rather should his sovereign lord attend:<BR>
Love for his lady fits him with a rein<BR>
And bit, which lets him not to Africk wend;<BR>
Wheels him, and to a counter course again<BR>
Spurs him, and threats his restive mood to shend,<BR>
Save he maintains the treaty, and the troth<BR>
Pledged to the paladin with solemn oath.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
A wakeful, stinging care, on the other side<BR>
Scourges and goads no less the cavalier;<BR>
Lest, if he now from Agramant divide,<BR>
He should be taxed with baseness or with fear.<BR>
If many deem it well he should abide,<BR>
To many and many it would ill appear:<BR>
Many would say, that oaths unbinding are,<BR>
Which &#8217;tis unlawful and unjust to swear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
He all that day and the ensuing night<BR>
Remains alone, and so the following day;<BR>
Forever sifting in his doubtful sprite,<BR>
If it be better to depart or stay:<BR>
Lastly for Agramant decides the knight;<BR>
To him in Africk will he wend his way:<BR>
Moved by his love for his liege-lady sore,<BR>
But moved by honour and by duty more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
He made for Arles, where yet he hoped would ride<BR>
The fleet which him to Africa might bear;<BR>
Nor in the port nor offing ships espied,<BR>
Nor Saracens save dead beheld he there.<BR>
For Agramant had swept the roadstead wide,<BR>
And burnt what vessels in the haven were.<BR>
Rogero takes the road, when his hope fails,<BR>
Along the sea-beat shore toward Marseilles.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Upon some boat he hoped to lay his hand,<BR>
Which him for love or force should thence convey.<BR>
Already Ogier&#8217;s son had made the land,<BR>
With the barbarians&#8217; fleet, his captive prey.<BR>
You could not there have cast a grain of sand<BR>
Between those vessels; moored closely lay<BR>
The mighty squadrons to that harbour brought,<BR>
With conquerors these, and those with prisoners fraught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
The vessels of the Moor that were not made<BR>
The food of fire and water on that night<BR>
(Saving some few that fled) were all conveyed<BR>
Safe to Marseilles by the victorious knight<BR>
Seven of those kings, that Moorish sceptres swayed,<BR>
Who, having seen their squadron put to flight,<BR>
With their seven ships had yielded to the foe,<BR>
Stood mute and weeping, overwhelmed with woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Dudon had issued forth upon dry land,<BR>
Bent to find Charlemagne that very day;<BR>
And of the Moorish spoil and captive band<BR>
Made in triumphal pomp a long display.<BR>
The prisoners all were ranged upon the strand,<BR>
And round them stood their Nubian victors gay;<BR>
Who, shouting in his praise, with loud acclaim,<BR>
Made all that region ring with Dudon&#8217;s name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero, when from far the ships he spied,<BR>
Believed they were the fleet of Agramant,<BR>
And, to know further, pricked his courser&#8217;s side;<BR>
Then, nearer, mid those knights of mickle vaunt,<BR>
Nasamon&#8217;s king a prisoner he desired,<BR>
Agricalt, Bambirago, Farurant,<BR>
Balastro, Manilardo, and Rimedont;<BR>
Who stood with weeping eyes and drooping front.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
In their unhappy state to leave that crew<BR>
The Child, who loved those monarchs, cannot bear;<BR>
That useless is the empty hand he knew;<BR>
That where force is not, little profits prayer.<BR>
He couched his lance, their keeper overthrew,<BR>
Then proved his wonted might with faulchion bare;<BR>
And in a moment stretched upon the strand<BR>
Above a hundred of the Nubian band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
The noise Sir Dudon hears, the slaughter spies,<BR>
But knows not who the stranger cavalier:<BR>
He marks how, put to rout, his people flies;<BR>
With anguish, with lament and mighty fear;<BR>
Quickly for courser, shield, and helmet cries,<BR>
(Bosom, and arms, and thighs, were mailed whilere)<BR>
Leaps on his horse, nor&#8212;having seized his lance&#8212;<BR>
Forgets he is a paladin of France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
He called on every one to stand aside,<BR>
And with the galling spur his courser prest;<BR>
Meanwhile a hundred other foes have died,<BR>
And filled with hope was every prisoner&#8217;s breast;<BR>
And as Rogero holy Dudon spied<BR>
Approach on horseback, (footmen were the rest,)<BR>
Esteeming him their head, he charged the knight,<BR>
Impelled by huge desire to prove his might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Already, on his part, had moved the Dane;<BR>
But when he saw the Child without a spear,<BR>
He flang is own far from him, in disdain<BR>
To take such vantage of the cavalier.<BR>
Admiring at Sir Dudon&#8217;s courteous vein,<BR>
&#8220;Belie himself he cannot,&#8221; said the peer,<BR>
&#8220;And of those perfect warriors must be one<BR>
That as the paladins of France are known.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If I my will can compass, he shall shew<BR>
His name, to me, ere further deed be done.&#8221;<BR>
He made demand; and in the stranger knew<BR>
Dudon, the Danish Ogier&#8217;s valiant son:<BR>
He from Rogero claimed an equal due,<BR>
And from the Child as courteous answer won.<BR>
&#8212;Their names on either side announced&#8212;the foes<BR>
A bold defiance speak, and come to blows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
Bold Dudon had with him that iron mace,<BR>
Which won him deathless fame in many a fight:<BR>
Wherewith he proved him fully of the race<BR>
Of that good Danish warrior, famed for might.<BR>
That best of faulchions, which through iron case<BR>
Of cuirass or of casque was wont to bite,<BR>
Youthful Rogero from the scabbard snatched,<BR>
And with the martial Dane his valour matched.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
But for the gentle youth was ever willed<BR>
To offend his lady-love the least he could,<BR>
And knew he should offend her, if he spilled,<BR>
In that disastrous battle, Dudon&#8217;s blood<BR>
(Well in the lineage of French houses skilled<BR>
He wist of Beatrice&#8217;s sisterhood,<BR>
&#8212;Bradamant&#8217;s mother she&#8212;with Armelline,<BR>
The mother of the Danish paladine).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
He therefore never thrust in that affray,<BR>
And rarely smote an edge on plate and chain.<BR>
Now warding off the mace, now giving way,<BR>
Before the fall of that descending bane.<BR>
Turpin believes it in Rogero lay<BR>
Sir Dudon in few sword-strokes to have slain.<BR>
Yet never when the Dane his guard foregoes,<BR>
Save on the faulchion&#8217;s flat descend the blows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
The flat as featly as the edge he plies,<BR>
Of that good faulchion forged of stubborn grain;<BR>
And, at strange blindman&#8217;s bluff, in weary wise,<BR>
Hammers on Dudon with such might and main,<BR>
He often dazzles so the warrior&#8217;s eyes,<BR>
That hardly he his saddle can maintain.<BR>
But to win better audience for my rhyme,<BR>
My canto I defer to other time.</TD></TR>
