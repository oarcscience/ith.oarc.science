Medoro, by Angelica&#8217;s quaint hand,<BR>
Is healed, and weds, and bears her to Cat&agrave;y.<BR>
At length Marphisa, with the chosen band,<BR>
After long suffering, makes Laiazzi&#8217;s bay.<BR>
Guido the savage, bondsman in the land,<BR>
Which impious women rule with civil sway,<BR>
With Marphisa strives in single fight,<BR>
And lodges her and hers at full of night.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
By whom he is beloved can no one know,<BR>
Who on the top of Fortune&#8217;s wheel is seated;<BR>
Since he, by true and faithless friends, with show<BR>
Of equal faith, in glad estate is greeted.<BR>
But, should felicity be changed to woe,<BR>
The flattering multitude is turned and fleeted!<BR>
While he who loves his master from his heart,<BR>
Even after death performs his faithful part.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Were the heart seen as is the outward cheer,<BR>
He who at court is held in sovereign grace,<BR>
And he that to his lord is little dear,<BR>
With parts reversed, would fill each other&#8217;s place;<BR>
The humble man the greater would appear,<BR>
And he, now first, be hindmost in the race.<BR>
But be Medoro&#8217;s faithful story said,<BR>
The youth who loved his lord, alive or dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
The closest path, amid the forest gray,<BR>
To save himself, pursued the youth forlorn;<BR>
But all his schemes were marred by the delay<BR>
Of that sore weight upon his shoulders born.<BR>
The place he knew not, and mistook the way,<BR>
And hid himself again in sheltering thorn.<BR>
Secure and distant was his mate, that through<BR>
The greenwood shade with lighter shoulders flew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
So far was Cloridan advanced before,<BR>
He heard the boy no longer in the wind;<BR>
But when he marked the absence of Medore,<BR>
It seemed as if his heart was left behind.<BR>
&#8220;Ah! how was I so negligent,&#8221; (the Moor<BR>
Exclaimed) &#8220;so far beside myself, and blind,<BR>
That I, Medoro, should without thee fare,<BR>
Nor know when I deserted thee or where?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
So saying, in the wood he disappears,<BR>
Plunging into the maze with hurried pace;<BR>
And thither, whence he lately issued, steers,<BR>
And, desperate, of death returns in trace.<BR>
Cries and the tread of steeds this while he hears,<BR>
And word and the tread of foemen, as in chase:<BR>
Lastly Medoro by his voice is known,<BR>
Disarmed, on foot, &#8217;mid many horse, alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
A hundred horsemen who the youth surround,<BR>
Zerbino leads, and bids his followers seize<BR>
The stripling: like a top, the boy turns round<BR>
And keeps him as he can: among the trees,<BR>
Behind oak, elm, beech, ash, he takes his ground,<BR>
Nor from the cherished load his shoulders frees.<BR>
Wearied, at length, the burden he bestowed<BR>
Upon the grass, and stalked about his load.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
As in her rocky cavern the she-bear,<BR>
With whom close warfare Alpine hunters wage,<BR>
Uncertain hangs about her shaggy care,<BR>
And growls in mingled sound of love and rage,<BR>
To unsheath her claws, and blood her tushes bare,<BR>
Would natural hate and wrath the beast engage;<BR>
Love softens her, and bids from strife retire,<BR>
And for her offspring watch, amid her ire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Cloridan who to aid him knows not how,<BR>
And with Medoro willingly would die,<BR>
But who would not for death this being forego,<BR>
Until more foes than one should lifeless lie,<BR>
Ambushed, his sharpest arrow to his bow<BR>
Fits, and directs it with so true an eye,<BR>
The feathered weapon bores a Scotchman&#8217;s brain,<BR>
And lays the warrior dead upon the plain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Together, all the others of the band<BR>
Turned thither, whence was shot the murderous reed;<BR>
Meanwhile he launched another from his stand,<BR>
That a new foe might by the weapon bleed,<BR>
Whom (while he made of this and that demand,<BR>
And loudly questioned who had done the deed)<BR>
The arrow reached&#8212;transfixed the wretch&#8217;s throat,<BR>
And cut his question short in middle note.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Zerbino, captain of those horse, no more<BR>
Can at the piteous sight his wrath refrain;<BR>
In furious heat, he springs upon Medore,<BR>
Exclaiming, &#8220;Thou of this shalt bear the pain.&#8221;<BR>
One hand he in his locks of golden ore<BR>
Enwreaths, and drags him to himself amain;<BR>
But, as his eyes that beauteous face survey,<BR>
Takes pity on the boy, and does not slay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
To him the stripling turns, with suppliant cry,<BR>
And, &#8220;By thy God, sir knight,&#8221; exclaims, &#8220;I pray,<BR>
Be not so passing cruel, nor deny<BR>
That I in earth my honoured king may lay:<BR>
No other grace I supplicate, nor I<BR>
This for the love of life, believe me, say.<BR>
So much, no longer, space of life I crave.<BR>
As may suffice to give my lord a grave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if you needs must feed the beast and bird,<BR>
Like Theban Creon, let their worst be done<BR>
Upon these limbs; so that by me interred<BR>
In earth be those of good Almontes&#8217; son.&#8221;<BR>
Medoro thus his suit, with grace, preferred,<BR>
And words&#8212;to move a mountain, and so won<BR>
Upon Zerbino&#8217;s mood, to kindness turned,<BR>
With love and pity he all over burned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
This while, a churlish horseman of the band,<BR>
Who little deference for his lord confest,<BR>
His lance uplifting, wounded overhand<BR>
The unhappy suppliant in his dainty breast.<BR>
Zerbino, who the cruel action scanned,<BR>
Was deeply stirred, the rather that, opprest<BR>
And livid with the blow the churl had sped,<BR>
Medoro fell as he was wholly dead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
So grieved Zerbino, with such wrath was stung,<BR>
&#8220;Not unavenged shalt thou remain,&#8221; he cries;<BR>
Then full of evil will in fury sprung<BR>
Upon the author of the foul emprize.<BR>
But he his vantage marks, and, from among<BR>
The warriors, in a moment slips and flies.<BR>
Cloridan who beholds the deed, at sight<BR>
Of young Medoro&#8217;s fall, springs forth to fight;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
And casts away his bow, and, &#8217;mid the band<BR>
Of foemen, whirls his falchion, in desire<BR>
Rather of death, than hoping that his hand<BR>
May snatch a vengeance equal to his ire.<BR>
Amid so many blades, he views the sand<BR>
Tinged with his blood, and ready to expire,<BR>
And feeling he the sword no more can guide,<BR>
Lets himself drop by his Medoro&#8217;s side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
The Scots pursue their chief, who pricks before,<BR>
Through the deep wood, inspired by high disdain,<BR>
When he has left the one and the other Moor,<BR>
This dead, that scarce alive, upon the plain.<BR>
There for a mighty space lay young Medore,<BR>
Spouting his life-blood from so large a vein,<BR>
He would have perished, but that thither made<BR>
A stranger, as it chanced, who lent him aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
By chance arrived a damsel at the place,<BR>
Who was (though mean and rustic was her wear)<BR>
Of royal presence and of beauteous face,<BR>
And lofty manners, sagely debonair:<BR>
Her have I left unsung so long a space,<BR>
That you will hardly recognise the fair.<BR>
Angelica, in her (if known not) scan,<BR>
The lofty daughter of Cat&agrave;y&#8217;s great khan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Angelica, when she had won again<BR>
The ring Brunello had from her conveyed,<BR>
So waxed in stubborn pride and haught disdain,<BR>
She seemed to scorn this ample world, and strayed<BR>
Alone, and held as cheap each living swain,<BR>
Although, amid the best, by Fame arrayed:<BR>
Nor brooked she to remember a galant<BR>
In Count Orlando or king Sacripant;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
And above every other deed repented,<BR>
That good Rinaldo she had loved of yore;<BR>
And that to look so low she had consented,<BR>
(As by such choice dishonoured) grieved her sore.<BR>
Love, hearing this, such arrogance resented,<BR>
And would the damsel&#8217;s pride endure no more.<BR>
Where young Medoro lay he took his stand,<BR>
And waited her, with bow and shaft in hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
When fair Angelica the stripling spies,<BR>
Nigh hurt to death in that disastrous fray,<BR>
Who for his king, that there unsheltered lies,<BR>
More sad than for his own misfortune lay,<BR>
She feels new pity in her bosom rise,<BR>
Which makes its entry in unwonted way.<BR>
Touched was her haughty heart, once hard and curst,<BR>
And more when he his piteous tale rehearsed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
And calling back to memory her art,<BR>
For she in Ind had learned chirurgery,<BR>
(Since it appears such studies in that part<BR>
Worthy of praise and fame are held to be,<BR>
And, as an heir-loom, sires to sons impart,<BR>
With little aid of books, the mystery)<BR>
Disposed herself to work with simples&#8217; juice,<BR>
Till she in him should healthier life produce;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
And recollects a herb had caught her sight<BR>
In passing hither, on a pleasant plain,<BR>
What (whether dittany or pancy hight)<BR>
I know not; fraught with virtue to restrain<BR>
The crimson blood forth-welling, and of might<BR>
To sheathe each perilous and piercing pain,<BR>
She found it near, and having pulled the weed,<BR>
Returned to seek Medoro on the mead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Returning, she upon a swain did light,<BR>
Who was on horseback passing through the wood.<BR>
Strayed from the lowing herd, the rustic wight<BR>
A heifer, missing for two days, pursued.<BR>
Him she with her conducted, where the might<BR>
Of the faint youth was ebbing with his blood:<BR>
Which had the ground about so deeply dyed,<BR>
Life was nigh wasted with the gushing tide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Angelica alights upon the ground,<BR>
And he her rustic comrade, at her hest.<BR>
She hastened &#8217;twixt two stones the herb to pound,<BR>
Then took it, and the healing juice exprest:<BR>
With this did she foment the stripling&#8217;s wound,<BR>
And, even to the hips, his waist and breast;<BR>
And (with such virtue was the salve endued)<BR>
It stanched his life-blood, and his strength renewed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
And into him infused such force again,<BR>
That he could mount the horse the swain conveyed;<BR>
But good Medoro would not leave the plain<BR>
Till he in earth had seen his master laid.<BR>
He, with the monarch, buried Cloridane,<BR>
And after followed whither pleased the maid,<BR>
Who was to stay with him, by pity led,<BR>
Beneath the courteous shepherd&#8217;s humble shed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
Nor would the damsel quit the lowly pile<BR>
(So she esteemed the youth) till he was sound;<BR>
Such pity first she felt, when him erewhile<BR>
She saw outstretched and bleeding on the ground.<BR>
Touched by his mien and manners next, a file<BR>
She felt corrode her heart with secret wound;<BR>
She felt corrode her heart, and with desire,<BR>
By little and by little warmed, took fire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
The shepherd dwelt, between two mountains hoar,<BR>
In goodly cabin, in the greenwood shade,<BR>
With wife and children; and, short time before,<BR>
The brent-new shed had builded in the glade.<BR>
Here of his griesly wound the youthful Moor<BR>
Was briefly healed by the Cat&agrave;yan maid;<BR>
But who in briefer space, a sorer smart<BR>
Than young Medoro&#8217;s, suffered at her heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
A wound far wider and which deeper lies,<BR>
Now in her heart she feels, from viewless bow;<BR>
Which from the boy&#8217;s fair hair and beauteous eyes<BR>
Had the winged archer dealt: a sudden glow<BR>
She feels, and still the flames increasing rise;<BR>
Yet less she heeds her own than other&#8217;s woe:<BR>
&#8212;Heeds not herself, and only to content<BR>
The author of her cruel ill is bent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Her ill but festered and increased the more<BR>
The stripling&#8217;s wounds were seen to heal and close:<BR>
The youth grew lusty, while she suffered sore,<BR>
And, with new fever parched, now burnt, now froze:<BR>
From day to day in beauty waxed Medore:<BR>
She miserably wasted; like the snow&#8217;s<BR>
Unseasonable flake, which melts away<BR>
Exposed, in sunny place, to scorching ray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
She, if of vain desire will not die,<BR>
Must help herself, nor yet delay the aid.<BR>
And she in truth, her will to satisfy,<BR>
Deemed &#8217;twas no time to wait till she was prayed.<BR>
And next of shame renouncing every tye,<BR>
With tongue as bold as eyes, petition made,<BR>
And begged him, haply an unwitting foe,<BR>
To sheathe the suffering of that cruel blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
O Count Orlando, O king of Circassy,<BR>
Say what your valour has availed to you!<BR>
Say what your honour boots, what goodly fee<BR>
Remunerates ye both, for service true!<BR>
Sirs, show me but a single courtesy,<BR>
With which she ever graced ye,&#8212;old or new,&#8212;<BR>
As some poor recompense, desert, or guerdon,<BR>
For having born so long so sore a burden!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Oh! couldst thou yet again to life return,<BR>
How hard would this appear, O Agricane!<BR>
In that she whilom thee was wont to spurn,<BR>
With sharp repulse and insolent disdain.<BR>
O Ferrau, O ye thousand more, forlorn,<BR>
Unsung, who wrought a thousand feats in vain<BR>
For this ungrateful fair, what pain &#8217;twould be<BR>
Could you within his arms the damsel see!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
To pluck, as yet untouched, the virgin rose,<BR>
Angelica permits the young Medore.<BR>
Was none so blest as in that garden&#8217;s close<BR>
Yet to have set his venturous foot before.<BR>
They holy ceremonies interpose,<BR>
Somedeal to veil&#8212;to gild&#8212;the matter o&#8217;er.<BR>
Young Love was bridesman there the tie to bless,<BR>
And for brideswoman stood the shepherdess.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
In the low shed, with all solemnities,<BR>
The couple made their wedding as they might;<BR>
And there above a month, in tranquil guise,<BR>
The happy lovers rested in delight.<BR>
Save for the youth the lady has no eyes,<BR>
Nor with his looks can satisfy her sight.<BR>
Nor yet of hanging on his neck can tire,<BR>
Of feel she can content her fond desire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
The beauteous boy is with her night and day,<BR>
Does she untent herself, or keep the shed.<BR>
Morning or eve they to some meadow stray,<BR>
Now to this bank, and to that other led:<BR>
Haply, in cavern harboured, at mid-day,<BR>
Grateful as that to which Aeneas fled<BR>
With Dido, when the tempest raged above,<BR>
The faithful witness to their secret love.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Amid such pleasures, where, with tree o&#8217;ergrown,<BR>
Ran stream, or bubbling fountain&#8217;s wave did spin,<BR>
On bark or rock, if yielding were the stone,<BR>
The knife was straight at work or ready pin.<BR>
And there, without, in thousand places lone,<BR>
And in as many places graved, within,<BR>
MEDORO and ANGELICA were traced,<BR>
In divers cyphers quaintly interlaced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
When she believed they had prolonged their stay<BR>
More than enow, the damsel made design<BR>
In India to revisit her Cat&agrave;y,<BR>
And with its crown Medoro&#8217;s head entwine.<BR>
She had upon her wrist an armlet, gay<BR>
With costly gems, in witness and in sign<BR>
Of love to her by Count Orlando borne,<BR>
And which the damsel for long time had worn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
On Ziliantes, hid beneath the wave,<BR>
This Morgue bestowed; and from captivity<BR>
The youth (restored to Monodantes grave,<BR>
His ancient sire, through Roland&#8217;s chivalry)<BR>
To Roland in return the bracelet gave:<BR>
Roland, a lover, deigned the gorgeous fee<BR>
To wear, with the intention to convey<BR>
The present to his queen, of whom I say.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
No love which to the paladin she bears,<BR>
But that it costly is and wrought with care,<BR>
This to Angelica so much endears,<BR>
That never more esteemed was matter rare:<BR>
This she was suffered, in THE ISLE OF TEARS,<BR>
I know not by what privilege, to wear,<BR>
When, naked, to the whale exposed for food<BR>
By that inhospitable race and rude.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
She, not possessing wherewithal to pay<BR>
The kindly couple&#8217;s hospitality,<BR>
Served by them in their cabin, from the day<BR>
She there was lodged, with such fidelity,<BR>
Unfastened from her arm the bracelet gay,<BR>
And bade them keep it for her memory.<BR>
Departing hence the lovers climb the side<BR>
Of hills, which fertile France from Spain divide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
Within Valencia or Barcelona&#8217;s town<BR>
The couple thought a little to remain,<BR>
Until some goodly ship should make her boun<BR>
To loose for the Levant: as so the twain<BR>
Journey, beneath Gerona,&#8212;coming down<BR>
Those mountains&#8212;they behold the subject main;<BR>
And keeping on their left the beach below,<BR>
By beaten track to Barcelona go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
But, ere they there arrive, a crazed wight<BR>
They find, extended on the outer shore;<BR>
Who is bedaubed like swine, in filthy plight,<BR>
And smeared with mud, face, reins, and bosom o&#8217;er;<BR>
He comes upon them, as a dog in spite<BR>
Swiftly assails the stranger at the door;<BR>
And is about to do the lovers scorn,<BR>
But to the bold Marphisa I return&#8212;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa, Astolpho, Gryphon, Aquilant.<BR>
Of these and of the others will I tell:<BR>
Who, death before their eyes, the vext Levant<BR>
Traverse, and ill resist the boisterous swell.<BR>
While aye more passing proud and arrogant,<BR>
Waxes in rage and threat the tempest fell.<BR>
And now three days the angry gale has blown,<BR>
Nor signal of abatement yet has shown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
Waves lifted by the waxing tempest start<BR>
Castle and flooring, and, if yet there be<BR>
Aught standing left in any other part,<BR>
&#8217;Tis cut away and cast into the sea.<BR>
Here, pricking out their course upon the chart,<BR>
One by a lantern does his ministry,<BR>
Upon a sea-chest propt; another wight<BR>
Is busied in the well by torch&#8217;s light.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
This one beneath the poop, beneath the prow<BR>
That other, stands to watch the ebbing sand;<BR>
And (each half-glass run out) returns to know<BR>
What way the ship has made, and towards what land.<BR>
Thence all to speak their different thoughts, below,<BR>
To midships make resort, with chart in hand;<BR>
There where the mariners, assembled all,<BR>
Are met in council, at the master&#8217;s call.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
One says: &#8220;Abreast of Limiss&ograve; are we<BR>
Among the shoals&#8221;&#8212;and by his reckoning, nigh<BR>
The rocks of Tripoli and bark must be,<BR>
Where shipwrecked, for the most part, vessels lie.<BR>
Another: &#8220;We are lost on Sataly,<BR>
Whose coast makes many patrons weep and sigh.&#8221;<BR>
According to their judgment, all suggest<BR>
Their treasons, each with equal dread opprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
More spitefully the wind on the third day<BR>
Blows, and the sea more yeasty billows rears:<BR>
The fore-mast by the first is borne away,<BR>
The rudder by the last, with him who steers.<BR>
Better than steel that man will bide the assay,<BR>
&#8212;Of marble breast&#8212;who has not now his fears.<BR>
Marphisa, erst so confident &#8217;mid harms,<BR>
Denied not but that day she felt alarms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
A pilgrimage is vowed to Sinai,<BR>
To Cyprus and Gallicia, and to Rome,<BR>
Ettino, and other place of sanctity,<BR>
If such is named, and to the holy tomb.<BR>
Meanwhile, above the sea and near the sky,<BR>
The bark is tost, with shattered plank and boom;<BR>
From which the crew had cut, in her distress,<BR>
The mizenmast, to make her labour less.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
They bale and chest and all their heavy lumber<BR>
Cast overboard, from poop, and prow, and side;<BR>
And every birth and cabin disencumber<BR>
Of merchandize, to feed the greedy tide.<BR>
Water to water others of the number<BR>
Rendered, by whom the spouting pumps were plied.<BR>
This in the hold bestirs himself, where&#8217;er<BR>
Planks opened by the beating sea appear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
They in this trouble, in this woe, remained<BR>
For full four days; and helpless was their plight,<BR>
And a full victory the sea had gained,<BR>
If yet a little had endured its spite:<BR>
But them with hope of clearer sky sustained<BR>
The wished appearance of St. Elmo&#8217;s light,<BR>
Which (every spar was gone) descending glowed<BR>
Upon a boat, which in the prow was stowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
When, flaming, they the beauteous light surveyed,<BR>
All those aboard kneeled down in humble guise,<BR>
And Heaven for peace and for smooth water prayed,<BR>
With trembling voices and with watery eyes.<BR>
Nor longer waxed the storm, which had dismayed,<BR>
Till then enduring in such cruel wise.<BR>
North-wester or cross-wind no longer reigns;<BR>
But tyrant of the sea the south remains.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
This on the sea remained so passing strong,<BR>
And from its sable mouth so fiercely blew,<BR>
And bore with it so swift a stream and strong<BR>
Of the vext waters, that it hurried through<BR>
Their tumbling waves the shattered bark along,<BR>
Faster than gentle falcon ever flew;<BR>
And sore the patron feared, to the world&#8217;s brink<BR>
It would transport his bark, or wreck or sink.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
For this the master finds a remedy,<BR>
Who bids them cast out spars, and veer away<BR>
A line which holds this float, and as they flee,<BR>
So, by two-thirds, their furious course delay.<BR>
This counsel boots, and more the augury<BR>
From him whose lights upon the gunwale play.<BR>
This saves the vessel, haply else undone;<BR>
And makes her through the sea securely run.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
They, driven on Syria, in Laiazzo&#8217;s bay<BR>
A mighty city rise; so nigh at hand,<BR>
That they can from the vessel&#8217;s deck survey<BR>
Two castles, which the port within command.<BR>
Pale turns the patron&#8217;s visage with dismay,<BR>
When he perceives what is the neighbouring land,<BR>
Who will not to the port for shelter hie,<BR>
Nor yet can keep the open sea, nor fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
They cannot fly, nor yet can keep the sea;<BR>
For mast and yards are gone, and by the stroke<BR>
Of the huge billows beating frequently,<BR>
Loosened is plank, and beam and timber broke:<BR>
And certain death to make the port would be,<BR>
Or to be doomed to a perpetual yoke.<BR>
For each is made a slave, or sentenced dead,<BR>
Thither by evil Chance or Error led.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
Sore dangerous &#8217;twas to doubt; lest hostile band<BR>
Should sally from the puissant town in sight,<BR>
With armed barks, and upon theirs lay hand,<BR>
In evil case for sea, and worse for fight.<BR>
What time the patron knows not what command<BR>
To give, of him inquires the English knight<BR>
What kept his mind suspended in that sort,<BR>
And why at first he had not made the port.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
To him relates the patron how a crew<BR>
Of murderous women tenanted that shore,<BR>
Which, by their ancient law, enslave or slew<BR>
All those whom Fortune to this kingdom bore;<BR>
And that he only could such for eschew<BR>
That in the lists ten champions overbore,<BR>
And having this achieved, the following night<BR>
In bed should with ten damsels take delight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
And if he brings to end the former feat,<BR>
But afterwards the next unfinished leaves,<BR>
They kill him, and as slaves his following treat,<BR>
Condemned to delve their land or keep their beeves.<BR>
&#8212;If for the first and second labour meet&#8212;<BR>
He liberty for all his band achieves,<BR>
Not for himself; who there must stay and wed<BR>
Ten wives by him selected for his bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
So strange a custom of the neighbouring strand<BR>
Without a laugh Astolpho cannot hear;<BR>
Sansonet and Marphisa, near at hand,<BR>
Next Aquilant, and he, his brother dear,<BR>
Arrive: to them the patron who from land<BR>
Aye keeps aloof, explains the cause of fear,<BR>
And cries: &#8220;I liefer in the sea would choke,<BR>
Than here of servitude endure the yoke.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
The sailors by the patron&#8217;s rede abide,<BR>
And all the passengers affrighted sore;<BR>
Save that Marphisa took the other side<BR>
With hers, who deemed that safer was the shore<BR>
Than sea, which raging round them, far and wide,<BR>
Than a hundred thousand swords dismayed them more.<BR>
Them little this, or other place alarms,<BR>
So that they have but power to wield their arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
The warriors are impatient all to land:<BR>
But boldest is of these the English peer;<BR>
Knowing how soon his horn will clear the strand,<BR>
When the scared foe its pealing sound shall hear.<BR>
To put into the neighbouring port this band<BR>
Desires, and are at strife with those who fear.<BR>
And they who are the strongest, in such sort<BR>
Compel the patron, that he makes the port.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Already when their bark was first espied<BR>
At sea, within the cruel city&#8217;s view,<BR>
They had observed a galley, well supplied<BR>
With practised mariners and numerous crew<BR>
(While them uncertain counsels did divide)<BR>
Make for their wretched ship, the billows through:<BR>
Her lofty prow to their short stern and low<BR>
These lash, and into port the vessel tow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
They thitherward were worked with warp and oar,<BR>
Rather than with assistance of the sail;<BR>
Since to lay starboard course or larboard more,<BR>
No means were left them by the cruel gale.<BR>
Again their rugged rhind the champions wore,<BR>
Girding the faithful falchion with the mail,<BR>
And with unceasing hope of comfort fed<BR>
Master and mariners opprest with dread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
Like a half-moon, projected from the beach,<BR>
More than four miles about, the city&#8217;s port;<BR>
Six hundred paces deep; and crowning each<BR>
Horn of the circling haven, was a fort;<BR>
On every side, secure from storm or breach,<BR>
(Save only from the south, a safe resort)<BR>
In guise of theatre the town extended<BR>
About it, and a hill behind ascended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
No sooner there the harboured ship was seen<BR>
(The news had spread already through the land)<BR>
Than thitherward, with martial garb and mien,<BR>
Six thousand women trooped, with bow in hand;<BR>
And, to remove all hope of flight, between<BR>
One castle and the other, drew a band;<BR>
And with strong chains and barks the port enclosed;<BR>
Which ever, for that use, they kept disposed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
A dame, as the Cumean sybil gray,<BR>
Or Hector&#8217;s ancient mother of renown,<BR>
Made call the patron out, and bade him say,<BR>
If they their lives were willing to lay down;<BR>
Or were content beneath the yoke to stay,<BR>
According to the custom of the town,<BR>
&#8212;One of two evils they must choose,&#8212;be slain,<BR>
Or captives, one and all, must there remain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis true, if one so bold and of such might<BR>
Be found amid your crew,&#8221; (the matron said),<BR>
&#8220;That he ten men of ours engage in fight,<BR>
And can in cruel battle lay them dead,<BR>
And, after, with ten women, in one night,<BR>
Suffice to play the husband&#8217;s part in bed,<BR>
He shall remain our sovereign, and shall sway<BR>
The land, and you may homeward wend your way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And at your choice to stay shall also be,<BR>
Whether a part or all, but with this pact,<BR>
That he who here would stay and would be free,<BR>
Can with ten dames the husband&#8217;s part enact.<BR>
But if your chosen warrior fall or flee,<BR>
By his ten enemies at once attacked,<BR>
Or for the second function have not breath,<BR>
To slavery you we doom, and him to death.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
At what she deemed the cavaliers would start,<BR>
The beldam found them bold; for to compete<BR>
With those they should engage, and play their part<BR>
The champions hoped alike in either feat.<BR>
Nor failed renowned Marphisa&#8217;s valiant heart,<BR>
Albeit for the second dance unmeet;<BR>
Secure, where nature had her aid denied,<BR>
The want should with the falchion be supplied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
The patron is commanded their reply<BR>
Resolved in common council to unfold;<BR>
The dames at pleasure may their prowess try,<BR>
And shall in lists and bed allow them bold.<BR>
The lashings from the vessels they untie,<BR>
The skipper heaves the warp, and bids lay hold,<BR>
And lowers the bridge; o&#8217;er which, in warlike weed,<BR>
The expectant cavaliers their coursers lead.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
These through the middle of the city go,<BR>
And see the damsels, as they forward fare,<BR>
Ride through the streets, succinct, in haughty show,<BR>
And arm, in guise of warriors, in the square.<BR>
Nor to gird sword, nor fasten spur below,<BR>
Is man allowed, nor any arm to wear;<BR>
Excepting, as I said, the ten; to follow<BR>
The ancient usage which those women hallow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
All others of the manly sex they seat,<BR>
To ply the distaff, broider, card and sow,<BR>
In female gown descending to the feet,<BR>
Which renders them effeminate and slow;<BR>
Some chained, another labour to complete,<BR>
Are tasked, to keep their cattle, or to plough.<BR>
Few are the males; and scarce the warriors ken,<BR>
Amid a thousand dames, a hundred men.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
The knights determining by lot to try<BR>
Who in their common cause on listed ground,<BR>
Should slay the ten, with whom they were to vie,<BR>
And in the other field ten others wound,<BR>
Designed to pass the bold Marphisa by,<BR>
Believing she unfitting would be found;<BR>
And would be, in the second joust at eve,<BR>
Ill-qualified the victory to achieve.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
But with the others she, the martial maid,<BR>
Will run her risque; and &#8217;tis her destiny.<BR>
&#8220;I will lay down this life,&#8221; the damsel said,<BR>
&#8220;Rather than you lay down your liberty.<BR>
But this&#8221;&#8212;with that she pointed to the blade<BR>
Which she had girt&#8212;&#8220;is your security,<BR>
I will all tangles in such manner loose,<BR>
As Alexander did the Gordian noose.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I will not henceforth stranger shall complain,<BR>
So long as the world lasts, of this repair.&#8221;<BR>
So said the maid, nor could the friendly train<BR>
Take from her what had fallen to her share.<BR>
Then,&#8212;either every thing to lose, or gain<BR>
Their liberty,&#8212;to her they leave the care.<BR>
With stubborn plate and mail all over steeled,<BR>
Ready for cruel fight, she takes the field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
High up the spacious city is place,<BR>
With steps, which serve as seats in rising rows;<BR>
Which for nought else is used, except the chase,<BR>
Tourney, or wrestling match, or such-like shows.<BR>
Four gates of solid bronze the rabble flows<BR>
In troubled tide; and to Marphisa bold,<BR>
That she may enter, afterwards is told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
On pieballed horse Marphisa entered,&#8212;spread<BR>
Were circles dappling all about his hair,&#8212;<BR>
Of a bold countenance and little head,<BR>
And beauteous points, and haughty gait and air.<BR>
Out of a thousand coursers which he fed,<BR>
Him, as the best, and biggest, and most rare,<BR>
King Norandino chose, and, decked with brave<BR>
And costly trappings, to Marphisa gave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Through the south gate, from the mid-day, the plain<BR>
Marphisa entered, nor expected long,<BR>
Before she heard approaching trumpet-strain<BR>
Peal through the lists in shrilling notes and strong;<BR>
And, looking next towards the northern wain,<BR>
Saw her ten opposites appear: among<BR>
These, as their leader, pricked a cavalier,<BR>
Excelling all the rest in goodly cheer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
On a large courser came the leading foe,<BR>
Which was, excepting the near foot behind<BR>
And forehead, darker than was ever crow:<BR>
His foot and forehead with some white were signed.<BR>
The horseman did his horse&#8217;s colours show<BR>
In his own dress; and hence might be divined,<BR>
He, as the mournful hue o&#8217;erpowered the clear,<BR>
Was less inclined to smile, than mournful tear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
At once their spears in rest nine warriors laid,<BR>
When the trump sounded, in the hostile train,<BR>
But he in black no sign of jousting made,<BR>
As if he held such vantage in disdain:<BR>
Better he deemed the law were disobeyed,<BR>
Than that his courtesy should suffer stain.<BR>
The knight retires apart, and sits to view<BR>
What against nine one single lance can do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Of smooth and balanced pace, the damsel&#8217;s horse<BR>
To the encounter her with swiftness bore;<BR>
Who poised a lance so massive in the course,<BR>
It would have been an overweight for four.<BR>
She, disembarking, as of greatest force,<BR>
The boom had chosen out of many more.<BR>
At her fierce semblance when in motion, quail<BR>
A thousand hearts, a thousand looks grow pale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
The bosom of the first she opens so,<BR>
As might surprise, if naked were the breast:<BR>
She pierced the cuirass and the mail below;<BR>
But first a buckler, solid and well prest,<BR>
A yard behind the shoulders of the foe<BR>
Was seen the steel, so well was it addrest.<BR>
Speared on her lance she left him on the plain,<BR>
And at the others drove with flowing rein;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
And so she shocked the second of the crew,<BR>
And dealt the third so terrible a blow,<BR>
From sell and life, with broken spine, the two<BR>
She drove at once. So fell the overthrow,<BR>
And with such weight she charged the warriors through!<BR>
So serried was the battle of the foe!&#8212;<BR>
I have seen bombard open in such mode<BR>
The squadrons, as that band Marphisa strowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
Many good spears were broken on the dame,<BR>
Who was as little moved as solid wall,<BR>
When revellers play the chace&#8217;s merry game,<BR>
Is ever moved by stroke of heavy ball.<BR>
So hard the temper of her corslet&#8217;s mail,<BR>
The strokes aye harmless on the breast-plate fall,<BR>
Whose steel was heated in the fires of hell,<BR>
And in Avernus&#8217; water slaked by spell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
At the end of the career, she checked her steed,<BR>
Wheeled him about, and for a little stayed;<BR>
And then against the others drove at speed,<BR>
Broke them, and to the handle dyed her blade.<BR>
Here shorn of arms, and there of head, they bleed;<BR>
And other in such manner cleft the maid,<BR>
That breast, and head, and arms together fell,<BR>
Belly and legs remaining in the sell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
With such just measure him she cleaves, I say,<BR>
Where the two haunches and the ribs confine:<BR>
And leaves him a half figure, in such way<BR>
As what we before images divine,<BR>
Of silver, oftener made of wax, survey;<BR>
Which supplicants from far and near enshrine,<BR>
In thanks for mercy shown, and to bestow<BR>
A pious quittance for accepted vow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Marphisa next made after one that flew,<BR>
And overtook the wretch, and cleft (before<BR>
He the mid square had won) his collar through,<BR>
So clean, no surgeon ever pieced it more.<BR>
One after other, all in fine she slew,<BR>
Or wounded every one she smote so sore,<BR>
She was secure, that never more would foe<BR>
Arise anew from earth, to work her woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
The cavalier this while had stood aside,<BR>
Who had the ten conducted to the place,<BR>
Since, with so many against one to ride,<BR>
Had seemed to him advantage four and base;<BR>
Who, now he by a single hand espied<BR>
So speedily his whole array displaced,<BR>
Pricked forth against the martial maid, to show<BR>
&#8217;Twas courtesy, not fear, had made him slow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
He, signing with his right hand, made appear<BR>
That he would speak ere their career was run,<BR>
Nor thinking that beneath such manly cheer<BR>
A gentle virgin was concealed, begun:<BR>
&#8220;I wot thou needs must be, sir cavalier,<BR>
Sore wearied with such mighty slaughter done;<BR>
And if I were disposed to weary thee<BR>
More than thou art, it were discourtesy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To thee, to rest until to-morrow&#8217;s light,<BR>
Then to renew the battle, I concede.<BR>
No honour &#8217;twere to-day to prove my might<BR>
On thee, whom weak and overwrought I read.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Arms are not new to me, nor listed fight;<BR>
Nor does fatigue so short a toil succeed,&#8221;<BR>
Answered Marphisa, &#8220;and I, at my post,<BR>
Hope to prove this upon thee, to thy cost.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I thank thee for thy offer of delay,<BR>
But need not what thy courtesy agrees;<BR>
And yet remains so large a space of day<BR>
&#8217;Twere very shame to spend it all in ease.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Oh! were I (he replied) so sure to appay<BR>
My heart with everything which best would please,<BR>
As thine I shall appay in this!&#8212;but see,<BR>
That ere thou thinkest, daylight fail not thee.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
So said he, and obedient to his hest<BR>
Two spears, say rather heavy booms, they bear.<BR>
He to Marphisa bids consigns the best,<BR>
And the other takes himself: the martial pair<BR>
Already, with their lances in the rest,<BR>
Wait but till other blast the joust declare.<BR>
Lo! earth and air and sea the noise rebound,<BR>
As they prick forth, at the first trumpet&#8217;s sound!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
No mouth was opened and no eyelid fell,<BR>
Nor breath was drawn, amid the observant crew:<BR>
So sore intent was every one to spell<BR>
Which should be conqueror of the warlike two.<BR>
Marphisa the black champion from his sell,<BR>
So to o&#8217;erthrow he shall not rise anew,<BR>
Levels her lance; and the black champion, bent<BR>
To slay Marphisa, spurs with like intent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Both lances, made of willow thin and dry,<BR>
Rather than stout and stubborn oak, appeared;<BR>
So splintered even to the rest, they fly:<BR>
While with such force the encountering steeds careered,<BR>
It seemed, as with a scythe-blade equally<BR>
The hams of either courser had been sheared.<BR>
Alike both fall; but voiding quick the seat,<BR>
The nimble riders start upon their feet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Marphisa in her life, with certain wound,<BR>
A thousand cavaliers on earth had laid;<BR>
And never had herself been borne to ground;<BR>
Yet quitted now the saddle, as was said.<BR>
Not only at the accident astound,<BR>
But nigh beside herself, remained the maid.<BR>
Strange to the sable cavalier withal,<BR>
Unwont to be unhorsed, appeared his fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
They scarcely touch the ground before they gain<BR>
Their feet, and now the fierce assault renew,<BR>
With cut and thrust; which now with shield the twain<BR>
Or blade ward off, and now by leaps eschew.<BR>
Whether the foes strike home, or smite in vain,<BR>
Blows ring, and echo parted aether through.<BR>
More force those shields, those helms, those breast-plates show<BR>
Than anvils underneath the sounding blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
If heavy falls the savage damsel&#8217;s blade,<BR>
That falls not lightly of her warlike foe.<BR>
Equal the measure one the other paid;<BR>
And both receive as much as they bestow.<BR>
He who would see two daring spirits weighed,<BR>
To seek two fiercer need no further go.<BR>
Nor to seek more dexterity or might;<BR>
For greater could not be in mortal wight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
The women who have sate long time, to view<BR>
The champions with such horrid strokes offend,<BR>
Nor sign of trouble in the warriors true<BR>
Behold, nor yet of weariness, commend<BR>
Them with just praises, as the worthiest two<BR>
That are, where&#8217;er the sea&#8217;s wide arms extend.<BR>
They deem these of mere toil and labour long<BR>
Must die, save they be strongest of the strong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Communing with herself, Marphisa said,<BR>
&#8220;That he moved not before was well for me!<BR>
Who risqued to have been numbered with the dead,<BR>
If he at first had joined his company.<BR>
Since, as it is, I hardly can make head<BR>
Against his deadly blows.&#8221; This colloquy<BR>
She with herself maintained, and while she spoke,<BR>
Ceased not to ply her sword with circling stroke.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Twas well for me,&#8221; the other cried again,<BR>
&#8220;That to repose I did not leave the knight.<BR>
I now from him defend myself with pain,<BR>
Who is o&#8217;erwearied with the former fight:<BR>
What had he been, renewed in might and main,<BR>
If he had rested till to-morrow&#8217;s light?<BR>
Right fortunate was I, as man could be,<BR>
That he refused my proffered courtesy!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
Till eve they strove, nor did it yet appear<BR>
Which had the vantage of the doubtful fray:<BR>
Nor, without light, could either foe see clear<BR>
Now to avoid the furious blows; when day<BR>
Was done, again the courteous cavalier<BR>
To his illustrious opposite &#8217;gan say;<BR>
&#8220;What shall we do, since ill-timed shades descend,<BR>
While we with equal fortune thus contend?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Meseems, at least, that till to-morrow&#8217;s morn<BR>
&#8217;Twere better thou prolonged thy life: no right<BR>
Have I thy doom, sir warrior, to adjourn<BR>
Beyond the limits of one little night.<BR>
Nor will I that by me the blame be born<BR>
That thou no longer shalt enjoy the light.<BR>
With reason to the sex&#8217;s charge, by whom<BR>
This place is governed, lay thy cruel doom.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If I lament thee and thy company,<BR>
HE knows, by whom all hidden things are spied.<BR>
Thou and thy comrades may repose with me,<BR>
For whom there is no safe abode beside:<BR>
Since leagued against you in conspiracy<BR>
Are all those husbands by thy hand have died.<BR>
For every valiant warrior of the men<BR>
Slain in the tourney, consort was of ten.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The scathe they have to-day received from thee,<BR>
Would ninety women wreak with vengeful spite;<BR>
And, save thou take my hospitality,<BR>
Except by them to be assailed this night.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;I take thy proffer in security,&#8221;<BR>
(Replied Marphisa), &#8220;that the faith so plight,<BR>
And goodness of thy heart, will prove no less,<BR>
Than are thy corporal strength and hardiness.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But if, as having to kill me, thou grieve,<BR>
Thou well mayst grieve, for reasons opposite;<BR>
Nor hast thou cause to laugh, as I conceive,<BR>
Nor hitherto has found me worst in fight.<BR>
Whether thou wouldst defer the fray, or leave,<BR>
Or prosecute by this or other light,<BR>
Behold me prompt thy wishes to fulfil;<BR>
Where and whenever it shall be thy will!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
So by consent the combatants divided,<BR>
Till the dawn broke from Ganges&#8217; stream anew;<BR>
And so remained the question undecided,<BR>
Which was the better champion of the two,<BR>
To both the brothers and the rest who sided<BR>
Upon that part, the liberal lord did sue<BR>
With courteous prayer, that till the coming day<BR>
They would be pleased beneath his roof to stay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
They unsuspecting with the prayer complied,<BR>
And by the cheerful blaze of torches white<BR>
A royal dome ascended, with their guide,<BR>
Divided into many bowers and bright.<BR>
The combatants remain as stupified,<BR>
On lifting up their vizors, at the sight<BR>
One of the other; for (by what appears)<BR>
The warrior hardly numbers eighteen years.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
Much marvels with herself the gentle dame,<BR>
That one so young so well should do and dare.<BR>
Much marvels he (his wonderment the same)<BR>
When he her sex agnizes by her hair.<BR>
Questioning one another of their name,<BR>
As speedily reply the youthful pair.<BR>
But how was hight the youthful cavalier,<BR>
Await till the ensuing strain to hear.</TD></TR>
