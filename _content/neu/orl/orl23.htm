<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Astolpho soars in air. Upon account<BR>
Of Pinnabel is prisoned Scotland&#8217;s heir:<BR>
By Roland freed, Frontino Rodomont<BR>
Takes from Hippalca, trusted to her care.<BR>
With Mandricardo strives Anglantes&#8217; count:<BR>
Who, next, offended by his lady fair,<BR>
Into the fury falls, so strange and fell,<BR>
Which in the world has not a parallel.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Let each assist the other in his need;<BR>
Seldom good actions go without their due;<BR>
And if their just reward should not succeed,<BR>
At least, nor death, nor shame, nor loss ensue.<BR>
Who wrongs another, the remembered meed<BR>
As well shall have, and soon or later rue.<BR>
That mountains never meet, but that men may,<BR>
And oft encounter, is an ancient say.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Now mark what chanced to Pinnabel, the event<BR>
Of having borne himself so wickedly:<BR>
He at the last received due punishment,<BR>
Due and deserved by his iniquity.<BR>
And God, who for the most is ill content<BR>
To see the righteous suffer wrongfully,<BR>
Secured the maid from harm, and will secure<BR>
All who from every wickedness are pure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Pinnabel deemed he to an end had brought,<BR>
And buried deep in earth, the martial maid;<BR>
Nor weening to behold her more, less thought<BR>
To her his treason&#8217;s forfeit to have paid.<BR>
Nor profits it the wily traitor ought<BR>
To be among the forts his father swayed.<BR>
For Altaripa here its summit rears,<BR>
Amid rude hills, confining on Poictiers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Anselm in Altaripa held command,<BR>
The count from whom was sprung this evil seed:<BR>
Who, to escape from angry Clermont&#8217;s hand,<BR>
Of friends and of assistance stood in need.<BR>
At a hill&#8217;s foot, with her avenging brand,<BR>
Bradamant made the worthless traitor bleed;<BR>
Who found no better succour in the strife<BR>
Than piteous cry and fruitless prayer for life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
When she has put to death the treacherous peer,<BR>
Who to put her to death had erst intent,<BR>
To seek Rogero she again would steer,<BR>
But that her cruel fate would not consent;<BR>
Which, where the wood was loneliest and most drear,<BR>
To wander by close path the lady sent,<BR>
Until the western sun withdrew his light,<BR>
Abandoning the world above to night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Nor knowing where for shelter she should rove,<BR>
Bradamant in that place resolves to stay,<BR>
Couched on the verdant herbage of the grove;<BR>
And, sleeping, now awaits the dawn of day,<BR>
Now watching Saturn, Venus, Mars, and Jove,<BR>
And the other wandering gods upon their way:<BR>
But, whether waking or to sleep resigned,<BR>
Has aye Rogero present to her mind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
With sorrow and repentance oft assailed,<BR>
She from her inmost heart profoundly sighed,<BR>
That Anger over Love should have prevailed.<BR>
&#8220;Anger has torn me from my love,&#8221; (she cried,)<BR>
&#8220;Oh! had I made some note, which had availed,<BR>
Thither, whence I set out, my steps to guide,<BR>
When I departed on my ill emprize!<BR>
Sure I was lorn of memory and of eyes!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
These words and others she in mournful strain<BR>
Utters, and broods within her heart on more.<BR>
Meanwhile a wind of sighs, and plenteous rain<BR>
Of tears, are tokens of her anguish sore.<BR>
In the east, at last, expected long in vain,<BR>
The wished for twilight streaked the horizon o&#8217;er;<BR>
And she her courser took, which on the ley<BR>
Was feeding, and rode forth to meet the day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Nor far had rode, ere from the greenwood-trees<BR>
She issued, where the dome was erst displayed;<BR>
And many days her with such witcheries<BR>
The evil-minded wizard had delayed.<BR>
Here she Astolpho found, who at full ease<BR>
A bridle for the Hippogryph had made,<BR>
And here was standing, thoughtful and in pain<BR>
To whom he should deliver Rabicane.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
By chance she found him, as the cavalier<BR>
Had from the helm uncased his head to view;<BR>
So that when of the dingy forest clear,<BR>
Fair Bradamant her gentle cousin knew.<BR>
Him from afar she hailed with joyful cheer,<BR>
And now more nigh, to embrace the warrior flew;<BR>
And named herself, and raised her vizor high,<BR>
And let him plainly who she was espy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
None could Astolpho have found any where<BR>
With whom to leave his horse with more content,<BR>
As knowing she would guard the steed with care,<BR>
And to his lord on his return present;<BR>
And he believed that Heaven had, in its care,<BR>
Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter for this pleasure sent.<BR>
Her was he wont with pleasure aye to see,<BR>
But now with more in his necessity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
Embracing twice or thrice the cousins stand,<BR>
Fraternally, each other&#8217;s neck, and they<BR>
Had of each other&#8217;s welfare made demand<BR>
With much affection, ere the duke &#8217;gan say;<BR>
&#8220;Would I now see the winged people&#8217;s land,<BR>
Here upon earth I make too long delay.&#8221;<BR>
And opening to the dame the thought he brewed,<BR>
To her the flying horse Astolpho shewed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
But she scarce marvelled when above the plain<BR>
She saw the rising steed his wings unfold;<BR>
Since upon former time, with mastering rein.<BR>
On him had charged the dame that wizard old;<BR>
And made her eye and eyelid sorely strain,<BR>
So hard she gazed, his movements to behold;<BR>
The day that he bore off, with wonderous range,<BR>
Rogero on his journey, long and strange.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Astolpho says on her he will bestow<BR>
His Rabican; so passing swift of kind,<BR>
That, if the courser started when a bow<BR>
Was drawn, he left the feathered shaft behind;<BR>
And will as well his panoply forego,<BR>
That it may to Mount Alban be consigned:<BR>
And she for him preserve the martial weed;<BR>
Since of his arms he has no present need.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Bent, since a course in air was to be flown,<BR>
That he, as best he can, will make him light.<BR>
Yet keeps the sword and horn; although alone<BR>
The horn from every risque might shield the knight:<BR>
But he the lance abandons, which the son<BR>
Of Galaphron was wont to bear in flight;<BR>
The lance, by which whoever in the course<BR>
Was touched, fell headlong hurtling from his horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Backed by Astolpho, and ascending slow,<BR>
The hippogryph through yielding aether flew;<BR>
And next the rider stirred the courser so,<BR>
That in a thought he vanished out of view.<BR>
Thus with his pilot does the patron go,<BR>
Fearing the gale and rock, till he is through<BR>
The reefs; then, having left the shore behind,<BR>
Hoists every sail, and shoots before the wind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Bradamant, when departed was the peer,<BR>
Remained distressed in mind; since in what way<BR>
She knew not her good kinsman&#8217;s warlike gear<BR>
And courser to Mount Alban to convey.<BR>
For on her heart, which they inflame and tear,<BR>
The warm desire and greedy will yet prey<BR>
To see the Child; whom she to find once more<BR>
At Vallombrosa thought, if not before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Here standing in suspense, by chance she spied<BR>
A churl, that came towards her on the plain,<BR>
Who, at her best, Astolpho&#8217;s armour tied,<BR>
As best he might, and laid on Rabicane;<BR>
She next behind her bade the peasant guide<BR>
(One courser loaded and one loose) the twain.<BR>
Two were the steeds; for she had that before,<BR>
On which his horse from Pinnabel she bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
To Vallombrosa to direct her way<BR>
She thought, in hopes to find Rogero there:<BR>
But, fearing evermore to go astray,<BR>
Knew not how thither she might best repair.<BR>
The churl had of the country small assay,<BR>
And, sure to be bewildered, wend the pair:<BR>
Yet at a venture thitherward she hies,<BR>
Where she believes the place of meeting lies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
She here and there, as she her way pursued,<BR>
Turned, but found none to question of the road;<BR>
She saw at mid-day, issuing from the wood,<BR>
A fort, nor far removed was the abode,<BR>
Which on the summit of a mountain stood,<BR>
And to the lady like Mount Alban showed;<BR>
And was Mount Alban sure; in which repair<BR>
One of her brothers and her mother were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
She, when she recognized the place, became<BR>
Sadder at heart than I have power to say.<BR>
If she delays, discovered is the dame,<BR>
Nor thence will be allowed to wend her way:<BR>
If thence she wends not, of the amorous flame<BR>
Which so consumes her, she will be the prey,<BR>
Nor see Rogero more, nor compass aught<BR>
Which was at Vallombrosa to be wrought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Some deal she doubted: then to turn her steed,<BR>
Resolved upon Mount Alban&#8217;s castle near;<BR>
And, for she thence her way could deftly read,<BR>
Her course anew towards the abbey steer.<BR>
But Fortune, good or evil, had decreed<BR>
The maid, before she of the vale was clear,<BR>
Of one of her good brethren should be spied,<BR>
Alardo named, ere she had time to hide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
He came from billeting the bands which lay<BR>
Dispersed about that province, foot and horse;<BR>
For the surrounding district, to obey<BR>
King Charlemagne, had raised another force.<BR>
Embraces brotherly and friendly say,<BR>
Salutes and kindly cheer, ensue of course;<BR>
And next into Mount Alban, side by side,<BR>
They, communing of many matters, ride.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Bradamant enters Montalbano&#8217;s seat,<BR>
Whom Beatrice had mourned, and vainly sought<BR>
Through spacious France: &#8217;Tis here all welcome sweet,<BR>
The kiss and clasp of hand, she holds at nought,<BR>
While her a mother and a brother greet,<BR>
As the enamoured maid compares in thought<BR>
These with the loved Rogero&#8217;s fond embrace;<BR>
Which time will never from her mind efface.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
Because she could not go, one in her stead<BR>
To send to Vallombrosa she devised,<BR>
Who thither in the damsel&#8217;s name should speed;<BR>
By whom should young Rogero be apprised<BR>
What kept her thence; and prayed, if prayer should need,<BR>
That there he for love would be baptised;<BR>
And next, as was concerned, would intend<BR>
What might their bridal bring to happy end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
She purposed the same messenger should bear<BR>
As well to her Rogero his good steed;<BR>
Which he was ever wonted to hold dear,<BR>
Worthily dear; for sure so stout at need<BR>
And beauteous was no courser, far or near,<BR>
In land of Christian or of Paynim creed,<BR>
In occupation of the Gaul or Moor;<BR>
Except Bayardo good and Brigliador.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Valiant Rogero, when too bold of sprite<BR>
He backed the hippogryph and soared in air,<BR>
Frontino left (Frontino he was hight),<BR>
Whom Bradamant then took into her care,<BR>
And to Mount Alban sent; and had him dight,<BR>
And nourished, at large cost, with plenteous fare;<BR>
Nor let be rode except at easy pace,<BR>
Hence was he ne&#8217;er so sleek or well in case.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Each damsel and each dame who her obeyed,<BR>
She tasked, together with herself, to sew,<BR>
With subtle toil; and with fine gold o&#8217;erlaid<BR>
A piece of silk of white and sable hue:<BR>
With this she trapt the horse; then chose a maid,<BR>
Old Callitrephia&#8217;s daughter, from the crew;<BR>
Whose mother whilom Bradamant had nursed;<BR>
A damsel she in all her secrets versed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
How graven in her heart Rogero lies,<BR>
A thousand times to her she had confessed;<BR>
And had extolled above the deities<BR>
The manners, worth, and beauty be possessed.<BR>
&#8220;No better messenger could I devise,&#8221;<BR>
(She said, and called the damsel from the rest,)<BR>
&#8220;Nor have I one, Hippalca mine, more sage<BR>
And sure than three, to do my embassage.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Hippalca was the attendant damsel hight.<BR>
&#8220;Go,&#8221; (says her lady, and describes the way)<BR>
And afterwards informs the maid aright<BR>
Of all which to Rogero she should say;<BR>
And why she at the abbey failed the knight,<BR>
Who must not to bad faith ascribe her stay,<BR>
But this to Fortune charge, that so decides,<BR>
Who, more than we ourselves, our conduct guides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
She made the damsel mount upon a pad,<BR>
And put into her hand Frontino&#8217;s rein;<BR>
And, if she met with one so rude or mad,<BR>
Who to deprive her of the steed were fain,<BR>
Her to proclaim who was his owner, bade,<BR>
As that which might suffice to make him sane.<BR>
For she believed there was no cavalier,<BR>
But that Rogero&#8217;s name would make him fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
Of many and many things, whereof to treat<BR>
With good Rogero, in her stead, she showed;<BR>
Of which instructed well, her palfrey fleet<BR>
Hippalca stirred, nor longer there abode.<BR>
Through highway, field, and wood, a gloomy beat,<BR>
More than ten weary miles the damsel rode,<BR>
Ere any crossed her path on mischief bent,<BR>
Or even questioned witherward she went.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
At noon of day, descending from a mount,<BR>
She in a streight and ill declivity,<BR>
Led by a dwarf, encountered Rodomont,<BR>
Who was afoot and harnessed cap-a-pee.<BR>
The Moor towards her raised his haughty front,<BR>
And straight blasphemed the eternal Hierarchy,<BR>
That horse, so richly trapped and passing fair,<BR>
He had not found in a knight-errant&#8217;s care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
On the first courser he should find, the knight<BR>
Had sworn a solemn oath his hands to lay:<BR>
This was the first, nor he on steed could light<BR>
Fairer or fitter; yet to take away<BR>
The charger from a maid were foul despite.<BR>
Doubtful he stands, but covets sore the prey;<BR>
Eyes and surveys him, and says often, &#8220;Why<BR>
Is not as well the courser&#8217;s master by?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ah! would be were!&#8221; to him the maid replied,<BR>
&#8220;For haply he would make thee change thy thought.<BR>
A better knight than thee the horse doth ride,<BR>
And vainly would his match on earth be sought.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Who tramples thus on other&#8217;s fame?&#8221;&#8212;he cried;<BR>
And she&#8212;&#8220;Rogero&#8221;&#8212;said, as she was taught.<BR>
Then Rodomont&#8212;&#8220;The steed I may my own;<BR>
Since him a champion rides of such renown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If he, as you relate, be of such force,<BR>
That he surprises all beside in might,<BR>
I needs must pay the hire as well as horse;<BR>
And be this at the pleasure of the knight!<BR>
That I am Rodomont, to him discourse;<BR>
And, if indeed with me he lists to fight,<BR>
Me shall to find; in that I shine confest,<BR>
By my own light, in motion or at rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I leave such vestige wheresoe&#8217;er I tread,<BR>
The volleyed thunder leaves not worse below.&#8221;<BR>
He had thrown back, over Frontino&#8217;s head,<BR>
The courser&#8217;s gilded reins, in saying so,<BR>
Backed him, and left Hippalca sore bested;<BR>
Who, bathed in tears, and goaded by her woe,<BR>
Cries shame on him, and threats the king with ill:<BR>
Rodomont hearkens not, and climbs the hill:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Whither the dwarf conducts him on the trace<BR>
Of Doralice and Mandricardo bold.<BR>
Behind, Hippalca him in ceaseless chase,<BR>
Pursues with taunt and curses manifold.<BR>
What came of this is said in other place.<BR>
Turpin, by whom this history is told,<BR>
Here makes digression, and returns again<BR>
Thither, where faithless Pinnabel was slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
Duke Aymon&#8217;s daughter scarce had turned away<BR>
From thence, who on her track in haste had gone,<BR>
Ere thither by another path, astray,<BR>
Zerbino came, with that deceitful crone,<BR>
And saw the bleeding body where it lay:<BR>
And, though the warrior was to him unknown,<BR>
As good and courteous, felt his bosom swell,<BR>
With pity at that cruel sight and fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Dead lay Sir Pinnabel, and bathed in gore;<BR>
From whom such streams of blood profusely flow,<BR>
As were a cause for wonderment, had more<BR>
Swords than a hundred joined to lay him low.<BR>
A print of recent footsteps to explore<BR>
The cavalier of Scotland was not slow;<BR>
Who took the adventure, in the hope to read<BR>
Who was the doer of the murderous deed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
The hag to wait was ordered by the peer,<BR>
Who would return to her in little space.<BR>
She to the body of the count drew near,<BR>
And with fixt eye examined every place;<BR>
Who willed not aught, that in her sight was dear,<BR>
The body of the dead should vainly grace;<BR>
As one who, soiled with every other vice,<BR>
Surpassed all womankind in avarice.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
If she in any manner could have thought,<BR>
Or hoped to have concealed the intended theft,<BR>
The bleeding warrior&#8217;s surcoat, richly wrought,<BR>
She would, together with his arms, have reft;<BR>
But at what might be safely hidden, caught,<BR>
And, grieved at heart, forewent the glorious weft.<BR>
Him of a beauteous girdle she undrest,<BR>
And this secured between a double vest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
Zerbino after some short space came back,<BR>
Who vainly Bradamant had thence pursued<BR>
Through the green holt; because the beaten track<BR>
Was lost in many others in the wood;<BR>
And he (for daylight now began to lack)<BR>
Feared night should catch him &#8217;mid those mountains rude,<BR>
And with the impious woman thence, in quest<BR>
Of inn, from the disastrous valley prest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
A spacious town, which Altaripa hight,<BR>
Journeying the twain, at two miles&#8217; distance spy:<BR>
There stopt the pair, and halted for the night,<BR>
Which, at full soar, even now went up the sky:<BR>
Nor long had rested there ere, left and right,<BR>
They from the people heard a mournful cry;<BR>
And saw fast tears from every eyelid fall,<BR>
As if some cause of sorrow touched them all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
Zerbino asked the occasion, and &#8217;twas said<BR>
Tidings had been to Count Anselmo brought,<BR>
That Pinnabel, his son, was lying dead<BR>
In a streight way between two mountains wrought.<BR>
Zerbino feigned surprise, and hung his head,<BR>
In fear lest he the assassin should be thought;<BR>
But well divined this was the wight he found<BR>
Upon his journey, lifeless on the ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
After some little time, the funeral bier<BR>
Arrives, &#8217;mid torch and flambeau, where the cries<BR>
Are yet more thick, and to the starry sphere<BR>
Lament and noise of smitten hands arise;<BR>
And faster and from fuller vein the tear<BR>
Waters all cheeks, descending from the eyes;<BR>
But in a cloud more dismal than the rest,<BR>
Is the unhappy father&#8217;s visage drest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
While solemn preparation so was made<BR>
For the grand obsequies, with reverence due,<BR>
According to old use and honours paid,<BR>
In former age, corrupted by each new;<BR>
A proclamation of their lord allayed<BR>
Quickly the noise of the lamenting crew;<BR>
Promising any one a mighty gain<BR>
That should denounce by whom his son was slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
From voice to voice, from one to other ear,<BR>
The loud proclaim they through the town declare;<BR>
Till this the wicked woman chanced to hear,<BR>
Who past in rage the tyger or the bear;<BR>
And hence the ruin of the Scottish peer,<BR>
Either in hatred, would the crone prepare,<BR>
Or were it she alone might boast to be,<BR>
In human form, without humanity;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Or were it but to gain the promised prize;&#8212;<BR>
She to seek out the grieving county flew,<BR>
And, prefacing her tale in likely wise,<BR>
Said that Zerbino did the deed; and drew<BR>
The girdle forth, to witness to her lies;<BR>
Which straight the miserable father knew;<BR>
And on the woman&#8217;s tale and token built<BR>
A clear assurance of Zerbino&#8217;s guilt.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
And, weeping, with raised hands, was heard to say,<BR>
He for his murdered son would have amends.<BR>
To block the hostel where Zerbino lay,<BR>
For all the town is risen, the father sends.<BR>
The prince, who deems his enemies away,<BR>
And no such injury as this attends,<BR>
In his first sleep is seized by Anselm&#8217;s throng,<BR>
Who thinks he has endured so foul a wrong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
That night in prison, fettered with a pair<BR>
Of heavy letters, is Zerbino chained.<BR>
For before yet the skies illuminated are,<BR>
The wrongful execution is ordained;<BR>
And in the place will he be quartered, where<BR>
The deed was done for which he is arraigned.<BR>
No other inquest is on this received;<BR>
It is enough that so their lord believed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
When, the next morn, Aurora stains with dye<BR>
Red, white, and yellow, the clear horizon,<BR>
The people rise, to punish (&#8220;Death!&#8221; their cry)<BR>
Zerbino for the crime he has not done:<BR>
They without order him accompany,<BR>
A lawless multitude, some ride, some run.<BR>
I&#8217; the midst the Scottish prince, with drooping head,<BR>
Is, bound upon a little hackney, led.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
But HE who with the innocent oft sides,<BR>
Nor those abandons who make him their stay,<BR>
For prince Zerbino such defence provides,<BR>
There is no fear that he will die to-day;<BR>
God thitherward renowned Orlando guides;<BR>
Whose coming for his safety paves the way:<BR>
Orlando sees beneath him on a plain<BR>
The youth to death conducted by the train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
With him was wended she, that in the cell,<BR>
Prisoned, Orlando found; that royal maid,<BR>
Child of Gallicia&#8217;s king, fair Isabel,<BR>
Whom chance into the ruffians&#8217; power conveyed,<BR>
What time her ship she quitted, by the swell<BR>
Of the wild sea and tempest overlaid:<BR>
The damsel, who, yet nearer her heart-core<BR>
Than her own vital being, Zerbino wore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
She had beneath Orlando&#8217;s convoy strayed,<BR>
Since rescued from the cave. When on the plain<BR>
The damsel saw the motley troop arrayed,<BR>
She asked Orlando what might be the train?<BR>
&#8220;I know not,&#8221; said the Count; and left the maid<BR>
Upon the height, and hurried towards the plain.<BR>
He marked Zerbino, and at the first sight<BR>
A baron of high worth esteemed the knight,</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
And asked him why and wherefore him they led<BR>
Thus captive, to Zerbino drawing near:<BR>
At this the doleful prince upraised his head,<BR>
And, having better heard the cavalier,<BR>
Rehearsed the truth; and this so well he said,<BR>
That he deserved the succour of the peer.<BR>
Well Sir Orlando him, by his reply,<BR>
Deemed innocent, and wrongly doomed to die.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
And, after he had heard &#8217;twas at the hest<BR>
Of Anselm, Count of Altaripa, done,<BR>
Was certain &#8217;twas and outrage manifest,<BR>
Since nought but ill could spring from him; and one,<BR>
Moreover, was the other&#8217;s foe profest,<BR>
From ancient hate and enmity, which run<BR>
In Clermont and Maganza&#8217;s blood; a feud<BR>
With injuries, and death and shame pursued.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Orlando to the rabble cried, &#8220;Untie<BR>
The cavalier, unless you would be slain.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Who deals such mighty blows?&#8221;&#8212;one made reply,<BR>
That would be thought the truest of the train;<BR>
&#8220;Were he of fire who makes such bold defy,<BR>
We wax or straw, too haughty were the strain&#8221;:<BR>
And charged with that the paladin of France.<BR>
Orlando at the losel couched his lance.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
The shining armour which the chief had rent<BR>
From young Zerbino but the night before,<BR>
And clothed himself withal, poor succour lent<BR>
Against Orlando in that combat sore.<BR>
Against the churl&#8217;s right cheek the weapon went:<BR>
It failed indeed his tempered helm to bore,<BR>
But such a shock he suffered in the strife,<BR>
As broke his neck, and stretched him void of life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
All at one course, of other of the band,<BR>
With lance unmoved, he pierced the bosom through;<BR>
Left it; on Durindana laid his hand,<BR>
And broke into the thicket of the crew:<BR>
One head in twain he severed with the brand,<BR>
(While, from the shoulders lopt, another flew)<BR>
Of many pierced the throat; and in a breath<BR>
Above a hundred broke and put to death.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Above a third he killed, and chased the rest,<BR>
And smote, and pierced, and cleft, as he pursued.<BR>
Himself of helm or shield one dispossest;<BR>
One with spontoon or bill the champaign strewed<BR>
This one along the road, across it prest<BR>
A fourth; this squats in cavern or in wood.<BR>
Orlando, without pity, on that day<BR>
Lets none escape whom he has power to slay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
Of a hundred men and twenty, in that crew,<BR>
(So Turpin sums them) eighty died at least.<BR>
Thither Orlando finally withdrew,<BR>
Where, with a heart sore trembling in his breast,<BR>
Zerbino sat; how he at Roland&#8217;s view<BR>
Rejoiced, in verse can hardly be exprest:<BR>
Who, but that he was on the hackney bound,<BR>
Would at his feet have cast himself to ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
While Roland, after he had loosed the knight,<BR>
Helped him to don his shining arms again;<BR>
Stript from those serjeants&#8217; captain, who had dight<BR>
Himself with the good harness, to his pain;<BR>
The prince on Isabella turned his sight,<BR>
Who had halted on the hill above the plain:<BR>
And, after she perceived the strife was o&#8217;er,<BR>
Nearer the field of fight her beauties bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
When young Zerbino at his side surveyed<BR>
The lady, who by him was held so dear;<BR>
The beauteous lady, whom false tongue had said<BR>
Was drowned, so often wept with many a tear,<BR>
As if ice at his heart-core had been laid,<BR>
Waxed cold, and some deal shook the cavalier;<BR>
But the chill quickly past, and he, instead,<BR>
Was flushed with amorous fire, from foot to head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
From quickly clipping her in his embrace,<BR>
Him reverence for Anglantes&#8217; sovereign stayed;<BR>
Because he thought, and held for certain case,<BR>
That Roland was a lover of the maid;<BR>
So past from pain to pain; and little space<BR>
Endured the joy which he at first assayed.<BR>
And worse he bore she should another&#8217;s be,<BR>
Than hearing that the maid was drowned at sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
And worse he grieved, that she was with a knight<BR>
To whom he owed so much: because to wrest<BR>
The lady from his hand, was neither right,<BR>
Nor yet perhaps would prove an easy quest.<BR>
He, without quarrel, had no other wight<BR>
Suffered to part, of such a prize possest;<BR>
But would endure, Orlando (such his debt)<BR>
A foot upon his prostrate neck should set.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
The three in silence journey to a font,<BR>
Where they alight, and halt beside the well;<BR>
His helmet here undid the weary Count,<BR>
And made the prince too quit the iron shell.<BR>
The youth unhelmed, she sees her lover&#8217;s front,<BR>
And pale with sudden joy grows Isabel:<BR>
Then, changing, brightened like a humid flower,<BR>
When the warm sun succeeds to drenching shower.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
And without more delay or scruple, prest<BR>
To cast her arms about her lover dear;<BR>
And not a word could draw-forth from her breast,<BR>
But bathed his neck and face with briny tear.<BR>
Orlando, who remarked the love exprest,<BR>
Needing no more to make the matter clear,<BR>
Could not but, by these certain tokens, see<BR>
The could no other but Zerbino be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
When speech returned, ere yet the maiden well<BR>
Had dried her cheeks from the descending tear,<BR>
She only of the courtesy could tell<BR>
Late shown her by Anglantes&#8217; cavalier.<BR>
The prince, who in one scale weighed Isabel,<BR>
Together with his life, esteemed as dear,&#8212;<BR>
Fell at Orlando&#8217;s feet and him adored,<BR>
As to two lives at once by him restored.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Proffers and thanks had followed, with a round<BR>
Of courtesies between the warlike pair,<BR>
Had they not heard the covered paths resound,<BR>
Which overgrown with gloomy foliage were.<BR>
Upon their heads the helmet, late unbound,<BR>
They quickly place, and to their steeds repair;<BR>
And, lo! a knight and maid arrive, ere well<BR>
The cavaliers are seated in the sell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
This was the Tartar Mandricardo, who<BR>
In haste behind the paladin had sped,<BR>
To venge Alzirdo and Manilard, the two<BR>
Whom good Orlando&#8217;s valour had laid dead:<BR>
Though afterwards less eager to pursue,<BR>
Since he with him fair Doralice had led;<BR>
Whom from a hundred men, in plate and chain,<BR>
He, with a single staff of oak, had ta&#8217;en.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Yet knew not that it was Anglantes&#8217; peer<BR>
This while, of whom he had pursued the beat;<BR>
Though that he was a puissant cavalier<BR>
By certain signals was he taught to weet.<BR>
More than Zerbino him he eyed, and, near,<BR>
Perused the paladin from head to feet;<BR>
Then finding all the tokens coincide,<BR>
&#8220;Thou art the man I seek,&#8221; the paynim cried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis now ten days,&#8221; to him the Tartar said,<BR>
&#8220;That thee I still have followed; so the fame<BR>
Had stung me, and in me such longing bred,<BR>
Which of thee to our camp of Paris came:<BR>
When, amid thousands by thy hand laid dead,<BR>
Scarce one alive fled thither, to proclaim<BR>
The mighty havoc made by thy good hand,<BR>
&#8217;Mid Tremisena&#8217;s and Noritia&#8217;s band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I was not, as I knew, in following slow<BR>
Both to behold thee, and to prove thy might;<BR>
And by the surcoat o&#8217;er thine arms I know,<BR>
(Instructed of thy vest) thou art the knight:<BR>
And if such cognizance thou didst not show,<BR>
And, &#8217;mid a hundred, wert concealed from sight,<BR>
For what thou art thou plainly wouldst appear,<BR>
Thy worth conspicuous in thy haughty cheer.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No one can say,&#8221; to him Orlando cried,<BR>
&#8220;But that a valiant cavalier thou art:<BR>
For such a brave desire can ill reside,<BR>
&#8217;Tis my assurance, in a humble heart.<BR>
Since thou wouldst see me, would that thou inside,<BR>
Couldst as without, behold me! I apart<BR>
Will lay me helm, that in all points thy will<BR>
And purpose of thy quest I may fulfil.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But when thou well hast scanned me with thine eye,<BR>
To that thine other wish as well attend:<BR>
It yet remains for thee to satisfy<BR>
The want, which leads thee after me to wend;<BR>
That thou mayest mark if, in my valour, I<BR>
Agree with that bold cheer thou so commend.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;And now,&#8221; (exclaimed the Tartar), &#8220;for the rest!<BR>
For my first want is thoroughly redrest.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Orlando, all this while, from head to feet,<BR>
Searches the paynim with inquiring eyes:<BR>
Both sides, and next the pommel of his seat<BR>
Surveys, yet neither mace nor tuck espies;<BR>
And asks how he the combat will repeat,<BR>
If his good lance at the encounter flies.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Take thou no care for that,&#8221; replied the peer;<BR>
&#8220;Thus into many have I stricken fear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I have an oath in Heaven to gird no blade,<BR>
Till Durindana from the count be won.<BR>
Pursuing whom, I through each road here strayed,<BR>
With him to reckon for more posts than one.<BR>
If thou wilt please to hear, my oath I made<BR>
When on my head I placed this morion:<BR>
Which casque, with all the other arms I bear,<BR>
A thousand years ago great Hector&#8217;s were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To these good arms nought lacks beside the sword;<BR>
How it was stolen, to you I cannot say:<BR>
This now, it seems, is borne by Brava&#8217;s lord,<BR>
And hence is he so daring in affray.<BR>
Yet well I trust, if I the warrior board,<BR>
To make him render his ill-gotten prey.<BR>
Yet more; I seek the champion with desire<BR>
To avenge the famous Agrican, my sire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Him this Orlando slew by treachery,<BR>
I wot, nor could have slain in other wise.&#8221;<BR>
The count could bear no more, and, &#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis a lie!&#8221;<BR>
(Exclaims), &#8220;and whosoever says so, lies:<BR>
Him fairly did I slay; Orlando, I.<BR>
But what thou seekest Fortune here supplies;<BR>
And this the faulchion is, which thou has sought,<BR>
Which shall be thine if by thy valour bought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Although mine is the faulchion, rightfully,<BR>
Let us for it in courtesy contend;<BR>
Nor will I in this battle, that it be<BR>
More mine than thine, but to a tree suspend:<BR>
Bear off the weapon freely hence, if me<BR>
Thou kill or conquer.&#8221; As he made an end,<BR>
He Durindana from his belt unslung,<BR>
And in mid-field upon a sapling hung.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
Already distant half the range of bow<BR>
Is from his opposite each puissant knight,<BR>
And pricks against the other, nothing slow<BR>
To slack the reins or ply the rowels bright.<BR>
Already dealt is either mighty blow,<BR>
Where the helm yields a passage to the sight.<BR>
As if of ice, the shattered lances fly,<BR>
Broke in a thousand pieces, to the sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
One and the other lance parforce must split,<BR>
In that the cavaliers refuse to bend;<BR>
The cavaliers, who in the saddle sit,<BR>
Returning with the staff&#8217;s unbroken end.<BR>
The warriors, who with steed had ever smit,<BR>
Now, as a pair of hinds in rage contend<BR>
For the mead&#8217;s boundary or river&#8217;s right,<BR>
Armed with two clubs, maintain a cruel fight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
The truncheons which the valiant champions bear,<BR>
Fail in the combat, and few blows resist;<BR>
Both rage with mightier fury, here and there,<BR>
Left without other weapon than the fist;<BR>
With this the desperate foes engage, and, where<BR>
The hand can grapple, plate and mail untwist.<BR>
Let none desire, to guard himself from wrongs,<BR>
A heavier hammer or more holding tongs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
How can the Saracen conclude the fray<BR>
With honour, which he haughtily had sought?<BR>
&#8217;Twere forty to waste time in an assay<BR>
Where to himself more harm the smiter wrought<BR>
Than to the smitten: in conclusion, they<BR>
Closed, and the paynim king Orlando caught,<BR>
And strained against his bosom; what Jove&#8217;s son<BR>
Did by Antaeus, thinking to have done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Him griped athwart, he, in impetuous mood,<BR>
Would now push from him, now would closely strain;<BR>
And waxed so wroth that, in his heat of blood,<BR>
The Tartar little thought about his rein.<BR>
Firm in his stirrups self-collected stood<BR>
Roland, and watched his vantage to obtain;<BR>
He to the other courser&#8217;s forehead slipt<BR>
His wary hand, and thence the bridle stript.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
The Saracen assays with all his might<BR>
To choak, and from the sell his foeman tear:<BR>
With either knee Orlando grasps it tight,<BR>
Nor can the Tartar more him, here or there.<BR>
But with the straining of the paynim knight,<BR>
The girts which hold his saddle broken are.<BR>
Scarce conscious of his fall, Orlando lies,<BR>
With feet i&#8217; the stirrups, tightening yet his thighs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
As falls a sack of armour, with such sound<BR>
Tumbled Orlando, when he prest the plain.<BR>
King Mandricardo&#8217;s courser, when he found<BR>
His head delivered from the guiding rein,<BR>
Made off with him, unheeding what the ground,<BR>
Stumbling through woodland, or by pathway plain,<BR>
Hither and tither, blinded by his fear;<BR>
And bore with him the Tartar cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
The beauteous Doralice, who sees her guide<BR>
So quit the field,&#8212;dismayed at his retreat,<BR>
And wonted in his succour to confide,<BR>
Her hackney drives behind his courser fleet:<BR>
The paynim rates the charger, in his pride,<BR>
And smites him oftentimes with hands and feet;<BR>
Threatening, as if he understood his lore;<BR>
And where he&#8217;d stop the courser, chafes him more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Not looking to his feet, by high or low,<BR>
The beast of craven kind, with headlong force<BR>
Three miles in rings had gone, and more would go,<BR>
But that into a fosse which stopt their course,<BR>
Not lined with featherbed or quilt below,<BR>
Tumble, reversed, the rider and his horse.<BR>
On the hard ground was Mandricardo thrown,<BR>
Yet neither spoiled himself, nor broke a bone:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Here stopt the horse; but him he could not guide,<BR>
Left without bit his motions to restrain.<BR>
Brimfull of rage and choler, at his side,<BR>
The Tartar held him, grappled by the mane.<BR>
&#8220;Put upon him&#8221; (to Mandricardo cried<BR>
His lady, Doralice) &#8220;my hackney&#8217;s rein,<BR>
Since for the bridle I have little use;<BR>
For gentle is my palfrey, reined or loose.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
The paynim deems it were discourtesy<BR>
To accept the proffer by the damsel made.<BR>
But his through other means a rein will be;<BR>
Since Fortune, who his wishes well appaid,<BR>
Made thitherward the false Gabrina flee,<BR>
After she young Zerbino had betrayed:<BR>
Who like a she-wolf fled, which, as she hies,<BR>
At distance hears the hounds and hunters&#8217; cries.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
She had upon her back the gallant gear,<BR>
And the same youthful ornaments and vest,<BR>
Stript from the ill-taught damsel for her jeer,<BR>
That in her spoils the beldam might be drest,<BR>
And rode the horse that damsel backed whilere;<BR>
Who was among the choicest and the best.<BR>
Ere yet aware of her, the ancient dame<BR>
On Doralice and Mandricardo came.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
Stordilane&#8217;s daughter and the Tartar king<BR>
Laugh at the vest of youthful show and shape,<BR>
Upon that ancient woman, figuring<BR>
Like monkey, rather say, like grandam ape.<BR>
From her the Saracen designs to wring<BR>
The rein, and does the deed: upon the rape<BR>
Of the crone&#8217;s bridle, he, with angry cry,<BR>
Threatens and scares her horse, and makes him fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
He flies and hurries through the forest gray<BR>
That ancient woman, almost dead with fear,<BR>
By hill and dale, by straight and crooked way,<BR>
By fosse and cliff, at hazard, there and here.<BR>
But it imports me not so much to say<BR>
Of her, that I should leave Anglantes&#8217; peer;<BR>
Who, from annoyance of a foe released,<BR>
The broken saddle at his ease re-pieced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
He mounts his horse, and watches long, before<BR>
Departing, if the foe will re-appear;<BR>
Nor seeing puissant Mandricardo more,<BR>
At last resolves in search of him to steer.<BR>
But, as one nurtured well in courtly lore,<BR>
From thence departed not the cavalier,<BR>
Till he with kind salutes, in friendly strain,<BR>
Fair leaves had taken of the loving twain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
At his departure waxed Zerbino woe,<BR>
And Isabella wept for sorrow: they<BR>
Had wended with him, but the count, although<BR>
Their company was fair and good, said nay;<BR>
Urging for reason, nought so ill could show<BR>
In cavalier, as, when upon his way<BR>
To seek his foeman out, to take a friend,<BR>
Who him with arms might succour or defend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
Next, if they met the Saracen, before<BR>
They should encounter him, besought them say,<BR>
That he, Orlando, would for three days more.<BR>
Waiting him, in that territory stay:<BR>
But, after that, would seek the flags which bore<BR>
The golden lilies, and King Charles&#8217; array.<BR>
That Mandricardo through their means might know,<BR>
If such his pleasure, where to find his foe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
The lovers promised willingly to do<BR>
This, and whatever else he should command.<BR>
By different ways the cavaliers withdrew,<BR>
One on the right, and one on the left hand.<BR>
The count, ere other path he would pursue,<BR>
Took from the sapling, and replaced, his brand.<BR>
And, where he weened he might the paynim best<BR>
Encounter, thitherward his steed addrest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
The course in pathless woods, which, without rein,<BR>
The Tartar&#8217;s charger had pursued astray,<BR>
Made Roland for two days, with fruitless pain,<BR>
Follow him, without tidings of his way.<BR>
Orlando reached a rill of crystal vein,<BR>
On either bank of which a meadow lay;<BR>
Which, stained with native hues and rich, he sees,<BR>
And dotted o&#8217;er with fair and many trees.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
The mid-day fervour made the shelter sweet<BR>
To hardy herd as well as naked swain;<BR>
So that Orlando, well beneath the heat<BR>
Some deal might wince, opprest with plate and chain.<BR>
He entered, for repose, the cool retreat,<BR>
And found it the abode of grief and pain;<BR>
And place of sojourn more accursed and fell,<BR>
On that unhappy day, than tongue can tell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
Turning him round, he there, on many a tree,<BR>
Beheld engraved, upon the woody shore,<BR>
What as the writing of his deity<BR>
He knew, as soon as he had marked the lore.<BR>
This was a place of those described by me,<BR>
Whither ofttimes, attended by Medore,<BR>
From the near shepherd&#8217;s cot had wont to stray<BR>
The beauteous lady, sovereign of Cat&agrave;y.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
In a hundred knots, amid those green abodes,<BR>
In a hundred parts, their cyphered names are dight;<BR>
Whose many letters are so many goads,<BR>
Which Love has in his bleeding hear-core pight.<BR>
He would discredit in a thousand modes,<BR>
That which he credits in his own despite;<BR>
And would parforce persuade himself, that rhind<BR>
Other Angelica than his had signed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And yet I know these characters,&#8221; he cried,<BR>
&#8220;Of which I have so many read and seen;<BR>
By her may this Medoro be belied,<BR>
And me, she, figured in the name, may mean.&#8221;<BR>
Feeding on such like phantasies, beside<BR>
The real truth, did sad Orlando lean<BR>
Upon the empty hope, though ill contented,<BR>
Which he by self-illusions had fomented.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
But stirred and aye rekindled it, the more<BR>
That he to quench the ill suspicion wrought,<BR>
Like the incautious bird, by fowler&#8217;s lore,<BR>
Hampered in net or line; which, in the thought<BR>
To free its tangled pinions and to soar,<BR>
By struggling, is but more securely caught.<BR>
Orlando passes thither, where a mountain<BR>
O&#8217;erhangs in guise of arch the crystal fountain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
Splay-footed ivy, with its mantling spray,<BR>
And gadding vine, the cavern&#8217;s entry case;<BR>
Where often in the hottest noon of day<BR>
The pair had rested, locked in fond embrace.<BR>
Within the grotto, and without it, they<BR>
Had oftener than in any other place<BR>
With charcoal or with chalk their names pourtrayed,<BR>
Or flourished with the knife&#8217;s indenting blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
Here from his horse the sorrowing County lit,<BR>
And at the entrance of the grot surveyed<BR>
A cloud of words, which seemed but newly writ,<BR>
And which the young Medoro&#8217;s hand had made.<BR>
On the great pleasure he had known in it,<BR>
The sentence he in verses had arrayed;<BR>
Which in his tongue, I deem, might make pretence<BR>
To polished phrase; and such in ours the sense.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Gay plants, green herbage, rill of limpid vein,<BR>
And, grateful with cool shade, thou gloomy cave,<BR>
Where oft, by many wooed with fruitless pain,<BR>
Beauteous Angelica, the child of grave<BR>
King Galaphron, within my arms has lain;<BR>
For the convenient harbourage you gave,<BR>
I, poor Medoro, can but in my lays,<BR>
As recompence, for ever sing your praise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And any loving lord devoutly pray,<BR>
Damsel and cavalier, and every one,<BR>
Whom choice or fortune hither shall convey,<BR>
Stranger or native,&#8212;to this crystal run,<BR>
Shade, caverned rock, and grass, and plants, to say,<BR>
Benignant be to you the fostering sun<BR>
And moon, and may the choir of nymphs provide,<BR>
That never swain his flock may hither guide!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
In Arabic was writ the blessing said,<BR>
Known to Orlando like the Latin tongue,<BR>
Who, versed in many languages, best read<BR>
Was in this speech; which oftentimes from wrong,<BR>
And injury, and shame, had saved his head,<BR>
What time he roved the Saracens among.<BR>
But let him boast not of its former boot,<BR>
O&#8217;erbalanced by the present bitter fruit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
Three times, and four, and six, the lines imprest<BR>
Upon the stone that wretch perused, in vain<BR>
Seeking another sense than was exprest,<BR>
And ever saw the thing more clear and plain;<BR>
And all the while, within his troubled breast,<BR>
He felt an icy hand his heart-core strain.<BR>
With mind and eyes close fastened on the block,<BR>
At length he stood, not differing from the rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
Then well-nigh lost all feeling; so a prey<BR>
Wholly was he to that o&#8217;ermastering woe.<BR>
This is a pang, believe the experienced say<BR>
Of him who speaks, which does all griefs outgo.<BR>
His pride had from his forehead passed away,<BR>
His chin had fallen upon his breast below;<BR>
Nor found he, so grief barred each natural vent,<BR>
Moisture for tears, or utterance for lament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
Stiffed within, the impetuous sorrow stays,<BR>
Which would too quickly issue; so to abide<BR>
Water is seen, imprisoned in the vase,<BR>
Whose neck is narrow and whose swell is wide;<BR>
What time, when one turns up the inverted base,<BR>
Towards the mouth, so hastes the hurrying tide,<BR>
And in the streight encounters such a stop,<BR>
It scarcely works a passage, drop by drop.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
He somewhat to himself returned, and thought<BR>
How possibly the thing might be untrue:<BR>
The some one (so he hoped, desired, and sought<BR>
To think) his lady would with shame pursue;<BR>
Or with such weight of jealously had wrought<BR>
To whelm his reason, as should him undo;<BR>
And that he, whosoe&#8217;er the thing had planned,<BR>
Had counterfeited passing well her hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
With such vain hope he sought himself to cheat,<BR>
And manned some deal his spirits and awoke;<BR>
Then prest the faithful Brigliadoro&#8217;s seat,<BR>
As on the sun&#8217;s retreat his sister broke.<BR>
Nor far the warrior had pursued his beat,<BR>
Ere eddying from a roof he saw the smoke;<BR>
Heard noise of dog and kine, a farm espied,<BR>
And thitherward in quest of lodging hied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
Languid, he lit, and left his Brigliador<BR>
To a discreet attendant: one undrest<BR>
His limbs, one doffed the golden spurs he wore,<BR>
And one bore off, to clean, his iron vest.<BR>
This was the homestead where the young Medore<BR>
Lay wounded, and was here supremely blest.<BR>
Orlando here, with other food unfed,<BR>
Having supt full of sorrow, sought his bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
The more the wretched sufferer seeks for ease,<BR>
He finds but so much more distress and pain;<BR>
Who every where the loathed hand-writing sees,<BR>
On wall, and door, and window: he would fain<BR>
Question his host of this, but holds his peace,<BR>
Because, in sooth, he dreads too clear, too plain<BR>
To make the thing, and this would rather shrowd,<BR>
That it may less offend him, with a cloud.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
Little availed the count his self-deceit;<BR>
For there was one who spake of it unsought;<BR>
The sheperd-swain, who to allay the heat,<BR>
With which he saw his guest so troubled, thought:<BR>
The tale which he was wonted to repeat<BR>
&#8212;Of the two lovers&#8212;to each listener taught,<BR>
A history which many loved to hear,<BR>
He now, without reserve, &#8217;gan tell the peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
How at Angelica&#8217;s persuasive prayer,<BR>
He to his farm had carried young Medore,<BR>
Grievously wounded with an arrow; where,<BR>
In little space she healed the angry sore.<BR>
But while she exercised this pious care,<BR>
Love in her heart the lady wounded more,<BR>
And kindled from small spark so fierce a fire,<BR>
She burnt all over, restless with desire:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
Nor thinking she of mightiest king was born,<BR>
Who ruled in the east, nor of her heritage,<BR>
Forced by too puissant love, had thought no scorn<BR>
To be the consort of a poor foot-page.<BR>
&#8212;His story done, to them in proof was borne<BR>
The gem, which, in reward for harbourage,<BR>
To her extended in that kind abode,<BR>
Angelica, at parting, had bestowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
A deadly axe was this unhappy close,<BR>
Which, at a single stroke, lopt off the head;<BR>
When, satiate with innumerable blows,<BR>
That cruel hangman Love his hate had fed.<BR>
Orlando studied to conceal his woes;<BR>
And yet the mischief gathered force and spread,<BR>
And would break out parforce in tears and sighs,<BR>
Would he, or would be not, from mouth and eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
When he can give the rein to raging woe,<BR>
Alone, by other&#8217;s presence unreprest,<BR>
From his full eyes the tears descending flow,<BR>
In a wide stream, and flood his troubled breast.<BR>
&#8217;Mid sob and groan, he tosses to and fro<BR>
About his weary bed, in search of rest;<BR>
And vainly shifting, harder than a rock<BR>
And sharper than a nettle found its flock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
Amid the pressure of such cruel pain,<BR>
It past into the wretched sufferer&#8217;s head,<BR>
That oft the ungrateful lady must have lain,<BR>
Together with her leman, on that bed:<BR>
Nor less he loathed the couch in his disdain,<BR>
Nor from the down upstarted with less dread,<BR>
Than churl, who, when about to close his eyes,<BR>
Springs from the turf, if he a serpent spies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
In him, forthwith, such deadly hatred breed<BR>
That bed, that house, that swain, he will not stay<BR>
Till the morn break, or till the dawn succeed,<BR>
Whose twilight goes before approaching day.<BR>
In haste, Orlando takes his arms and steed,<BR>
And to the deepest greenwood wends his way.<BR>
And, when assured that he is there alone,<BR>
Gives utterance to his grief in shriek and groan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
Never from tears, never from sorrowing,<BR>
He paused; nor found he peace by night and day:<BR>
He fled from town, in forest harbouring,<BR>
And in the open air on hard earth lay.<BR>
He marvelled at himself, how such a spring<BR>
Of water from his eyes could stream away,<BR>
And breath was for so many sobs supplied;<BR>
And thus ofttimes, amid his mourning, cried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;These are no longer real tears which rise,<BR>
And which I scatter from so full a vein.<BR>
Of tears my ceaseless sorrow lacked supplies;<BR>
They stopt when to mid-height scarce rose my pain.<BR>
The vital moisture rushing to my eyes,<BR>
Driven by the fire within me, now would gain<BR>
A vent; and it is this which I expend,<BR>
And which my sorrows and my life will end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;No; these, which are the index of my woes,<BR>
These are not sighs, nor sighs are such; they fail<BR>
At times, and have their season of repose:<BR>
I feel, my breast can never less exhale<BR>
Its sorrow: Love, who with his pinions blows<BR>
The fire about my heart, creates this gale.<BR>
Love, by what miracle does thou contrive,<BR>
It wastes not in the fire thou keep&#8217;st alive?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I am not&#8212;am not what I seem to sight:<BR>
What Roland was is dead and under ground,<BR>
Slain by that most ungrateful lady&#8217;s spite,<BR>
Whose faithlessness inflicted such a wound.<BR>
Divided from the flesh, I am his sprite,<BR>
Which in this hell, tormented, walks its round,<BR>
To be, but in its shadow left above,<BR>
A warning to all such as thrust in love.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
All night about the forest roved the count,<BR>
And, at the break of daily light, was brought<BR>
By his unhappy fortune to the fount,<BR>
Where his inscription young Medoro wrought.<BR>
To see his wrongs inscribed upon that mount,<BR>
Inflamed his fury so, in him was nought<BR>
But turned to hatred, phrensy, rage, and spite;<BR>
Nor paused he more, but bared his faulchion bright;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
Cleft through the writing; and the solid block,<BR>
Into the sky, in tiny fragments sped.<BR>
Wo worth each sapling and the caverned rock,<BR>
Where Medore and Angelica were read!<BR>
So scathed, that they to shepherd or to flock<BR>
Thenceforth shall never furnish shade or bed.<BR>
And that sweet fountain, late so clear and pure,<BR>
From such tempestuous wrath was ill secure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
For he turf, stone, and trunk, and shoot, and lop,<BR>
Cast without cease into the beauteous source;<BR>
Till, turbid from the bottom to the top,<BR>
Never again was clear the troubled course.<BR>
At length, for lack of breath, compelled to stop,<BR>
(When he is bathed in sweat, and wasted force,<BR>
Serves not his fury more) he falls, and lies<BR>
Upon the mead, and, gazing upward, sighs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
Wearied and woe-begone, he fell to ground,<BR>
And turned his eyes toward heaven; nor spake he aught.<BR>
Nor ate, nor slept, till in his daily round<BR>
The golden sun had broken thrice, and sought<BR>
His rest anew; nor ever ceased his wound<BR>
To rankle, till it marred his sober thought.<BR>
At length, impelled by phrensy, the fourth day,<BR>
He from his limbs tore plate and mail away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Here was his helmet, there his shield bestowed;<BR>
His arms far off; and, farther than the rest,<BR>
His cuirass; through the greenwood wide was strowed<BR>
All his good gear, in fine; and next his vest<BR>
He rent; and, in his fury, naked showed<BR>
His shaggy paunch, and all his back and breast.<BR>
And &#8217;gan that phrensy act, so passing dread,<BR>
Of stranger folly never shall be said.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
So fierce his rage, so fierce his fury grew,<BR>
That all obscured remained the warrior&#8217;s sprite;<BR>
Nor, for forgetfulness, his sword he drew,<BR>
Or wonderous deeds, I trow, had wrought the knight:<BR>
But neither this, nor bill, nor axe to hew,<BR>
Was needed by Orlando&#8217;s peerless might.<BR>
He of his prowess gave high proofs and full,<BR>
Who a tall pine uprooted at a pull.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXV.</TD><TD>
He many others, with as little let<BR>
As fennel, wall-wort-stem, or dill, up-tore;<BR>
And ilex, knotted oak, and fir upset,<BR>
And beech, and mountain-ash, and elm-tree hoar.<BR>
He did what fowler, ere he spreads his net,<BR>
Does, to prepare the champaigne for his lore,<BR>
By stubble, rush, and nettle-stalk; and broke,<BR>
Like these, old sturdy trees and stems of oak.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVI.</TD><TD>
The shepherd swains, who hear the tumult nigh,<BR>
Leaving their flocks beneath the greenwood tree,<BR>
Some here some there across the forest hie,<BR>
And hurry thither, all, the cause to see.<BR>
&#8212;But I have reached such point, my history,<BR>
If I o&#8217;erpass this bound, may irksome be;<BR>
And I my story will delay to end,<BR>
Rather than by my tediousness offend.</TD></TR>
