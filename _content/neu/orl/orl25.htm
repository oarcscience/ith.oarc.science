<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Rogero Richardetto from the pains<BR>
Of fire preserves, doomed by Marsilius dead:<BR>
He to Rogero afterwards explains<BR>
Fully the cause while he to death was led.<BR>
Them mournful Aldigier next entertains,<BR>
And with them the ensuing morning sped,<BR>
Vivian and Malagigi to set free;<BR>
To Bertolagi sold for hire and fee.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Oh! mighty springs of war in youthful breast,<BR>
Impetuous force of love, and thirst of praise!<BR>
Nor yet which most avails is known aright:<BR>
For each by turns its opposite outweighs.<BR>
Within the bosom here of either knight,<BR>
Honour, be sure, and duty strongly sways:<BR>
For the amorous strife between them is delayed,<BR>
Till to the Moorish camp they furnish aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Yet love sways more; for, save that the command<BR>
Was laid upon them by their lady gay,<BR>
Neither would in that battle sheathe the brand,<BR>
Till he was crowned with the victorious bay;<BR>
And Agramant might vainly with his band,<BR>
For either knight&#8217;s expected succour, stay.<BR>
Then Love is not of evil nature still;<BR>
&#8212;He can at times do good, if often ill.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas now, suspending all their hostile rage,<BR>
One and the other paynim cavalier,<BR>
The Moorish host from siege to disengage,<BR>
For Paris, with the gentle lady, steer;<BR>
And with them goes as well that dwarfish page,<BR>
Who tracked the footsteps of the Tartar peer,<BR>
Till he had brought the warrior front to front,<BR>
In presence with the jealous Rodomont.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
They at a mead arrived, where, in disport,<BR>
Knights were reposing by a stream, one pair<BR>
Disarmed, another casqued in martial sort;<BR>
And with them was a dame of visage fair.<BR>
Of these in other place I shall report,<BR>
Not now; for first Rogero is my care,<BR>
That good Rogero, who, as I have shown,<BR>
Into a well the magic shield had thrown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
He from that well a mile is hardly gone<BR>
Ere he a courier sees arrive at speed,<BR>
Of those dispatched by King Troyano&#8217;s son<BR>
To knights whom he awaited in his need;<BR>
From him Rogero hears that so foredone<BR>
By Charles are those who hold the paynim creed,<BR>
They will, save quickly succoured in the strife,<BR>
As quickly forfeit liberty and life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Rogero stood awhile in pensive case,<BR>
Whom many warring thoughts at once opprest;<BR>
But neither fitted was the time nor place<BR>
To make his choice, or judge what promised best.<BR>
The courier he dismist, and turned his face<BR>
Whither he with the damsel was addrest;<BR>
Whom aye the Child so hurried on her way,<BR>
He left her not a moment for delay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Pursuing thence their ancient road again,<BR>
They reached a city, with the westering sun;<BR>
Which, in the midst of France, from Charlemagne<BR>
Marsilius had in that long warfare won:<BR>
Nor them to interrupt or to detain,<BR>
At drawbridge or at gate, was any one:<BR>
Though in the fosse, and round the palisade,<BR>
Stood many men, and piles of arms were laid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Because the troop about that fortress see<BR>
Accompanying him, the well-known dame,<BR>
They to Rogero leave the passage free,<BR>
Nor even question him from whence he came.<BR>
Reaching the square, of evil company<BR>
He finds it full, and bright with ruddy flame;<BR>
And, in the midst, is manifest to view<BR>
The youth condemned, with face of pallid hue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
As on the stripling&#8217;s face he turns his eyes,<BR>
Which hangs declined and wet with frequent tear,<BR>
Rogero thinks he Bradamant descries;<BR>
So much the youth resembles her in cheer:<BR>
More sure the more intently he espies<BR>
Her face and shape: when thus the cavalier:<BR>
&#8220;Or this is Bradamant, or I no more<BR>
Am the Rogero which I was before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She hath adventured with too daring will,<BR>
In rescue of the youth condemned to die;<BR>
And, for the enterprise had ended ill,<BR>
Hath there been taken, as I see. Ah! why<BR>
Was she so hot her purpose to fulfil,<BR>
That she must hither unattended hie!<BR>
&#8212;But I thank Heaven, that hither have I made:<BR>
Since I am yet in time to lend her aid.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
He drew his falchion without more delay,<BR>
(His lance was broken at the other town),<BR>
And, though the unarmed people making way,<BR>
Wounding flank, paunch, and bosom, bore them down.<BR>
He whirled his weapon, and, amid the array,<BR>
Smote some across the gullet, cheek, or crown.<BR>
Screaming, the dissipated rabble fled;<BR>
The most with cloven limbs or broken head.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
As while at feed, in full security,<BR>
A troop of fowl along the marish wend,<BR>
If suddenly a falcon from the sky<BR>
Swoop mid the crowd, and one surprise and rend,<BR>
The rest dispersing, leave their mate to die,<BR>
And only to their own escape attend;<BR>
So scattering hadst thou seen the frighted throng,<BR>
When young Rogero pricked that crowd among.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Rogero smites the head from six or four,<BR>
Who in escaping from the field are slow.<BR>
He to the breast divides as many more,<BR>
And countless to the eyes and teeth below.<BR>
I grant no helmets on their heads they wore,<BR>
But there were shining iron caps enow;<BR>
And, if fine helmets did their temples press,<BR>
His sword would cut as deep, or little less.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Such good Rogero&#8217;s force and valour are,<BR>
As never now-a-days in warrior dwell;<BR>
Nor yet in rampant lion, nor in bear,<BR>
Nor (whether home or foreign) beast more fell.<BR>
Haply with him the earthquake might compare,<BR>
Or haply the great devil&#8212;not he of hell&#8212;<BR>
But he who is my lord&#8217;s, who moves in fire,<BR>
And parts heaven, earth, and ocean in his ire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
At every stroke he never less o&#8217;erthrew<BR>
Than one, and oftener two, upon the plain;<BR>
And four, at once, and even five he slew;<BR>
So that a hundred in a thought were slain.<BR>
The sword Rogero from his girdle drew<BR>
As knife cuts curd, divides their plate and chain.<BR>
Falerina in Orgagna&#8217;s garden made,<BR>
To deal Orlando death, that cruel blade.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
But to have forged that falchion sorely rued,<BR>
Who saw her garden wasted by the brand.<BR>
What wreck, what ruin then must have ensued,<BR>
From this when wielded by such warrior&#8217;s hand?<BR>
If e&#8217;er Rogero force, e&#8217;er fury shewed,<BR>
If e&#8217;er his mighty valour well was scanned,<BR>
&#8217;Twas here; &#8217;twas here employed; &#8217;twas here displayed;<BR>
In the desire to give his lady aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
As hare from hound unslipt, that helpless train<BR>
Defends itself against the cavalier.<BR>
Many lay dead upon the cumbered plain,<BR>
And numberless were they who fled in fear.<BR>
Meanwhile the damsel had unloosed the chain<BR>
From the youth&#8217;s hands, and him in martial gear<BR>
Was hastening, with what speed she might, to deck,<BR>
With sword in hand and shield about his neck.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
He, who was angered sore, as best he cou&#8217;d,<BR>
Sought to avenge him of that evil crew;<BR>
And gave such signal proofs of hardihood,<BR>
As stamped him for a warrior good and true.<BR>
The sun already in the western flood<BR>
Had dipt his gilded wheels, what time the two,<BR>
Valiant Rogero and his young compeer,<BR>
Victorious issued, of the city clear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
When now Rogero and the stranger knight,<BR>
Clear of the city-gates, the champaigne reach,<BR>
The youth repays, with praises infinite,<BR>
Rogero in kind mode and cunning speech,<BR>
Who him, although unknown, had sought to right,<BR>
At risk of life, and prays his name to teach<BR>
That he may know to whom his thanks he owed<BR>
For such a mighty benefit bestowed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The visage of Bradamant I see,<BR>
The beauteous features and the beauteous cheer.&#8221;<BR>
Rogero said; &#8220;and yet the suavity<BR>
I of her well-known accents do not hear:<BR>
Nor such return of thanks appears to be<BR>
In place towards her faithful cavalier.<BR>
And if in very sooth it is the same,<BR>
How has the maid so soon forgot my name?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
In wary wise, intent the truth to find,<BR>
Rogero said, &#8220;You have I seen elsewhere;<BR>
And have again, and yet again, divined,<BR>
Yet know I not, nor can remember where.<BR>
Say it, yourself, if it returns to mind,<BR>
And, I beseech, your name as well declare:<BR>
Which I would gladly hear, in the desire<BR>
To know whom I have rescued from the fire.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8212;Me, it is possible you may have seen,<BR>
I know not when nor where (the youth replied);<BR>
For I too range the world, in armour sheen,<BR>
Seeking adventure strange on every side;<BR>
Or haply it a sister may have been,<BR>
Who to her waist the knightly sword has tied;<BR>
Born with me at a birth; so like to view,<BR>
The family discerns not who is who.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You not first, second, or even fourth will be,<BR>
Who have in this their error had to learn;<BR>
Nor father, brother, nor even mother me<BR>
From her (such our resemblance) can discern.<BR>
&#8217;Tis true, this hair, which short and loose you see,<BR>
In many guise, and hers, with many a turn,<BR>
And in long tresses wound about her brow,<BR>
Wide difference made between us two till now.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But since the day, that, wounded by a Moor<BR>
In the head (a story tedious to recite)<BR>
A holy man, to heal the damsel&#8217;s sore,<BR>
Cut short to the mid-ear her tresses bright,<BR>
Excepting sex and name, there is no more<BR>
One from the other to distinguish; hight<BR>
I Richardetto am, Bradamant she;<BR>
Rinaldo&#8217;s brother and his sister we.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And to displease you were I not afraid,<BR>
You with a wonder would I entertain,<BR>
Which chanced from my resemblance to the maid;<BR>
Begun in pleasure, finishing in pain.&#8221;<BR>
He to whom nought more pleasing could be said,<BR>
And to whose ears there was no sweeter strain<BR>
That what in some sort on his lady ran,<BR>
Besought the stripling so, that he began.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;It so fell out, that as my sister through<BR>
The neighbouring wood pursued her path, a wound<BR>
Was dealt the damsel by a paynim crew,<BR>
Which her by chance without a helmet found.<BR>
And she was fain to trim the locks which grew<BR>
Clustering about the gash, to maker her sound<BR>
Of that ill cut which in her head she bore:<BR>
Hence, shorn, she wandered through the forest hoar.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Ranging, she wandered to a shady font;<BR>
Where, worn and troubled, she, in weary wise,<BR>
Lit from her courser and disarmed her front,<BR>
And, couched upon the greenwood, closed her eyes.<BR>
A tale more pleasing than what I recount<BR>
In story there is none, I well surmise:<BR>
Thither repaired young Flordespine of Spain,<BR>
Who in that wood was hunting with her train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And, when she found my sister in the shade,<BR>
Covered, except her face, with martial gear,<BR>
&#8212;In place of spindle, furnished with the blade&#8212;<BR>
Believed that she beheld a cavalier:<BR>
The face and manly semblance she surveyed,<BR>
Till conquered was her heart: with courteous cheer<BR>
She wooed the maid to hunt with her, and past<BR>
With her alone into that hold at last.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When now she had her, fearless of surprise,<BR>
Safe in a solitary place, that dame,<BR>
By slow degrees, in words and amorous wise,<BR>
Showed her deep-wounded heart; with sighs of flame,<BR>
Breathed from her inmost breast, with burning eyes,<BR>
She spake her soul sick with desire; became<BR>
Now pale, now red; nor longer self-controlled,<BR>
Ravished a kiss, she waxed so passing bold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My sister was assured the huntress maid<BR>
Falsely conceited her a man to be;<BR>
Nor in that need could she afford her aid;<BR>
And found herself in sore perplexity.<BR>
&#8217; &#8217;Tis better that I now dispel (she said)<BR>
The foolish thought she feeds, and that in me<BR>
The damsel should a gentle woman scan,<BR>
Rather than take me for a craven man.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And she said well: for cravenhood it were<BR>
Befitting man of straw, not warrior true,<BR>
With whom so bright a lady deigned to pair,<BR>
So wonderous sweet and full of nectarous dew,<BR>
To clack like a poor cuckow to the fair,<BR>
Hanging his coward wing, when he should woo,<BR>
Shaping her speech to this in wary mode,<BR>
My sister that she was a damsel, showed;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That, like Camilla and like Hyppolite,<BR>
Sought fame in battle-field, and near the sea,<BR>
In Afric, in Arzilla, saw the light;<BR>
To shield and spear enured from infancy.<BR>
A spark this quenched not; nor yet burned less bright<BR>
The enamoured damsel&#8217;s kindled phantasy.<BR>
Too tardy came the salve to ease the smart:<BR>
So deep had Love already driven his dart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor yet less fair to her my sister&#8217;s face<BR>
Appeared, less fair her ways, less fair her guise;<BR>
Nor yet the heart returned into its place,<BR>
Which joyed itself within those dear-loved eyes.<BR>
Flordespine deems the damsel&#8217;s iron case<BR>
To her desire some hope of ease supplies;<BR>
And when she thinks she is indeed a maid,<BR>
Laments and sobs, with mighty woe downweighed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He who had marked her sorrow and lament,<BR>
That day, himself had sorrowed with the fair.<BR>
&#8216;What pains (she said) did ever wight torment,<BR>
So cruel, but that mine more cruel were?<BR>
I need not to accomplish my intent,<BR>
In other love, impure or pure, despair;<BR>
The rose I well might gather from the thorn:<BR>
My longing only is of hope forlorn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;If &#8217;twas thy pleasure, Love, to have me shent,<BR>
Because by glad estate thine anger stirred,<BR>
Thou with some torture might&#8217;st have been content<BR>
On other lovers used; but never word<BR>
Have I found written of a female bent<BR>
On love of female, mid mankind or herd.<BR>
Woman to woman&#8217;s beauty still is blind;<BR>
Nor ewe delights in ewe, nor hind in hind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Tis only I, on earth, in air, or sea,<BR>
Who suffer at thy hands such cruel pain;<BR>
And this thou hast ordained, that I may be<BR>
The first and last example in thy reign.<BR>
Foully did Ninus&#8217; wife and impiously<BR>
For her own son a passion entertain;<BR>
Loved was Pasiphae&#8217;s bull and Myrrha&#8217;s sire;<BR>
But mine is madder than their worst desire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Here female upon male had set her will;<BR>
Had hope; and, as I hear, was satisfied.<BR>
Pasiphae the wooden cow did fill:<BR>
Others, in other mode, their want supplied.<BR>
But, had he flown to me,&#8212;with all his skill,<BR>
Dan Daedalus had not the noose untied:<BR>
For one too diligent hath wreathed these strings;<BR>
Even Nature&#8217;s self, the puissantest of things.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;So grieves the maid, so goads herself and wears,<BR>
And shows no haste her sorrowing to forego;<BR>
Sometimes her face, sometimes her tresses tears,<BR>
And levels at herself the vengeful blow.<BR>
In pity, Bradamant the sorrow shares,<BR>
And is constrained to hear the tale of woe,<BR>
She studies to divert, with fruitless pain,<BR>
The strange and mad desire; but speaks in vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She, who requires assistance, not support,<BR>
Still more laments herself, with grief opprest.<BR>
By this the waning day was growing short,<BR>
For the low sun was crimsoning the west;<BR>
A fitting hour for those to seek a port,<BR>
Who would not in the wood set up their rest.<BR>
When to this city, near her sylvan haunt,<BR>
Young Flordespine invited Bradament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My sister the request could ill deny;<BR>
And so they came together to the place,<BR>
Where, but for you, by that ill squadron I<BR>
Had been compelled the cruel flame to face:<BR>
There Flordespina made her family<BR>
Caress and do my sister no small grace;<BR>
And, having in a female robe arraid,<BR>
Past her on all beholders for a maid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Because perceiving vantage there was none<BR>
In the male cheer by which she was misled,<BR>
The damsel held it wise, reproach to shun,<BR>
Which might by any carping tongue be said.<BR>
And this the rather: that the ill, which one<BR>
Of the two garments in her mind had bred,<BR>
Now with the other which revealed the cheat,<BR>
She would assay to drive from her conceit.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The ladies share one common bed that night,<BR>
Their bed the same, but different their repose.<BR>
One sleeps, one groans and weeps in piteous plight,<BR>
Because her wild desire more fiercely glows;<BR>
And on her wearied eyes should slumber light,<BR>
All is deceitful that brief slumber shows.<BR>
To her it seems, as if relenting Heaven<BR>
A better sex to Bradamant is given.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As the sick man with burning thirst distrest,<BR>
If he should sleep,&#8212;ere he that wish fulfil,&#8212;<BR>
Aye in his troubled, interrupted rest,<BR>
Remembers him of every once-seen rill:<BR>
So is the damsel&#8217;s fancy still possest,<BR>
In sleep, with images which glad her will.<BR>
Then from the empty dreams which crowd her brain,<BR>
She wakes, and, waking, finds the vision vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What vows she vowed, how oft that night she prayed,<BR>
To all her gods and Mahound, in despair!<BR>
&#8212;That they, by open miracle, the maid<BR>
Would change, and give her other sex to wear.<BR>
But all the lady&#8217;s vows were ill appaid,<BR>
And haply Heaven as well might mock the prayer;<BR>
Night fades, and Ph&#339;bus raises from the main<BR>
His yellow head, and lights the world again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;On issueing from their bed when day is broken,<BR>
The wretched Flordespina&#8217;s woes augment:<BR>
For of departing Bradamant had spoken,<BR>
Anxious to scape from that embarrassment.<BR>
The princess a prime jennet, as a token,<BR>
Forced on my parting sister, when she went;<BR>
And gilded housings, and a surcoat brave,<BR>
Which her own hand had richly broidered, gave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her Flordespine accompanied some way,<BR>
Then, weeping, to her castle made return.<BR>
So fast my sister pricked, she reached that day<BR>
Mount Alban; we who for her absence mourn,<BR>
Mother and brother, greet the martial may,<BR>
And her arrival with much joy discern:<BR>
For hearing nought, we feared that she was dead,<BR>
And had remained in cruel doubt and dread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Unhelmed, we wondered at her hair, which passed<BR>
In braids about her brow, she whilom wore;<BR>
Nor less we wondered at the foreign cast<BR>
Of the embroidered surcoat which she wore:<BR>
And she to us rehearsed, from first to last,<BR>
The story I was telling you before;<BR>
How she was wounded in the wood, and how,<BR>
For cure, were shorn the tresses from her brow;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And next how came on her, with labour spent,<BR>
&#8212;As by the stream she slept&#8212;that huntress bright;<BR>
And how, with all her false semblance well content,<BR>
She from the train withdrew her out of sight.<BR>
Nor left she any thing of her lament<BR>
Untold; which touched with pity every wight;<BR>
Told how the maid had harboured her, and all<BR>
Which past, till she revisited her Hall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Of Flordespine I knew: and I had seen<BR>
In Saragossa and in France the maid;<BR>
To whose bewitching eyes and lovely mien<BR>
My youthful appetite had often strayed:<BR>
Yet her I would not make my fancy&#8217;s queen;<BR>
For hopeless love is but a dream and shade:<BR>
Now I this proffered in such substance view,<BR>
Straitway the ancient flame breaks forth anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Love, with this hope, constructs his subtle ties;<BR>
Who other threads for me would vainly weave.<BR>
&#8217;Tis thus he took me, and explained the guise<BR>
In which I might the long-sought boon achieve.<BR>
Easy it were the damsel to surprise;<BR>
For as the likeness others could deceive,<BR>
Which I to Bradamant, my sister, bear,<BR>
This haply might as well the maid ensnare.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Whether I speed or no, I hold it wise,<BR>
Aye to pursue whatever give delight.<BR>
I with no other of my plan devise,<BR>
Nor any seek to counsel me aright.<BR>
Well knowing where the suit of armour lies<BR>
My sister doffed, I thither go at night;<BR>
Her armour and her steed to boot I take,<BR>
Nor stand expecting until daylight break.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I rode all night&#8212;Love served me as a guide&#8212;<BR>
To seek the home of beauteous Flordespine;<BR>
And there arrived, before in ocean&#8217;s tide<BR>
The western sun had hid his orbit sheen.<BR>
A happy man was he who fastest hied<BR>
To tell my coming to the youthful queen;<BR>
Expecting from that lady, for his pain,<BR>
Favour and goodly guerdon to obtain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For Bradamant the guests mistake me all,<BR>
&#8212;As you yourself but now&#8212;so much the more,<BR>
That I have both the courser and the pall<BR>
With which she left them but the day before.<BR>
Flordespine comes at little interval,<BR>
With such festivity and courteous lore,<BR>
And with a face, so jocund and so gay,<BR>
She could not, for her life, more joy display.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Her beauteous arms about my neck she throws,<BR>
And fondly clasping me, my mouth she kist.<BR>
If to my inmost heart the arrow goes,<BR>
Which Love directs, may well by you be wist.<BR>
She leads me to her chamber of repose<BR>
In haste, not suffers others to assist<BR>
In taking off my panoply of steel;<BR>
Disarming me herself from head to heel.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then, ordering from her store a costly vest,<BR>
She spread it, and&#8212;as I a woman were&#8212;<BR>
The lady me in that rich garment drest,<BR>
And in a golden net confined my hair.<BR>
I gravely moved my eye-balls, nor confest,<BR>
By gesture or by look, the sex I bear.<BR>
My voice, which might discover the deceit,<BR>
I tuned so well that none perceived the cheat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Next to the hall, where dame and cavalier<BR>
In crowds are gathered, we united go;<BR>
Who make to us such court and goodly cheer,<BR>
As men to queen or high-born lady show.<BR>
Here oft I laughed at some, with secret jeer,<BR>
Who, knowing not the sex concealed below<BR>
My flowing robe of feminine array,<BR>
Wooed me with wishful eyes in wanton way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When more advanced in now the festive night,<BR>
And the rich board&#8212;board plenteously purveyed<BR>
With what in season was most exquisite&#8212;<BR>
Has been some time removed, the royal maid<BR>
Expects not till I of myself recite<BR>
The cause, which thither me anew conveyed:<BR>
By her own courtesy and kindness led,<BR>
That lady prays me to partake her bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Damsels and dames withdrawn&#8212;with all the rest&#8212;<BR>
Pages and chamberlains, when now we lay,<BR>
One and the other, in our bed undrest,<BR>
With kindled torches, counterfeiting day;<BR>
&#8216;Marvel not, lady,&#8217; (her I thus addrest,)<BR>
&#8216;That I return after such short delay;<BR>
For, haply, thou imagined, that again<BR>
Thou shouldst not see me until Heaven knows when.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;The reason I departed from thy side,<BR>
And next of my return, explained shall be.<BR>
Could I unto thy fever have applied,<BR>
By longer sojourn here, a remedy,<BR>
I in thy service would have lived and died,<BR>
Nor would have been an hour away from thee:<BR>
But seeing how my stay increased thy woe,<BR>
I, who could do no better, fixed to go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Into the middle of a wood profound<BR>
By chance I from the beaten pathway strayed:<BR>
Where near me plaintive cries I hear resound,<BR>
As of a woman who intreated aid.<BR>
To a lake of crystal I pursue the sound,<BR>
And, there, amid the waves, a naked maid<BR>
Caught on the fish-hook of a Faun, survey,<BR>
Who would devour alive his helpless prey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Upon the losel, sword in hand, I ran,<BR>
And, for I could not aid in other wise,<BR>
Bereft of life that evil fisherman.<BR>
She in an instant to the water flies.<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;Me hast thou helped not vainly,&#8217; (she began)<BR>
And well shalt be rewarded&#8212;with what prize<BR>
Thou canst demand&#8212;for know I am a nymph,<BR>
And have my dwelling in this crystal lymph;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;And power is mine to work portentous ends;<BR>
Nature and Elements I force: thy prayer<BR>
Shape to the scope to which my strength extends,<BR>
And leave its satisfaction to my care.<BR>
Charmed by my song the moon from Heaven descends;<BR>
Fire can I freeze, and harden liquid air;<BR>
And I at times have stopt the sun, and stirred<BR>
This earth beneath me by a simple word.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Treasure I covet not, nor yet aspire<BR>
O&#8217;er land or people to hold sovereign sway;<BR>
Nor greater strength nor valour would acquire,<BR>
Nor fame in every warfare bear away;<BR>
But only to accomplish thy desire,<BR>
Entreat the damsel she will show some way.<BR>
Nor one nor other method I forestall;<BR>
But to her choice refer me, all in all.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Scarce my demand was made, before mine eye<BR>
Beneath the lymph engulphed that lady viewed:<BR>
Nor answered she my prayer, but, for reply,<BR>
Me with the enchanted element bedewed;<BR>
Which has no sooner touched my face than I,<BR>
I know not how, am utterly transmewed:<BR>
I see, I feel&#8212;yet doubting what I scan&#8212;<BR>
Feel, I am changed from woman into man.<BR>

        LXV - LXIX<BR>
   (Stazas LXV - LXIX untranslated by Rose)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The thing remained concealed between us two;<BR>
So that our bliss endured some months; at last<BR>
We were espied; and, as I sorely rue,<BR>
The tidings to the Spanish monarch past.<BR>
Thou that whilere preserved&#8217;st me from the crew,<BR>
Which me into the flames designed to cast,<BR>
By this mayst fully comprehend the rest;<BR>
But God alone can read my sorrowing breast.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
So Richardetto spake, and by his say<BR>
Made the dark path they trod less irksome be.<BR>
Up a small height this while their journey lay,<BR>
Girded with cliff and cavern, drear to see.<BR>
Bristling with rocks, a steep and narrow way<BR>
Was to that rugged hill the stubborn key;<BR>
A town, called Agrismonte, crowned the steep,<BR>
Which Aldigier of Clermont had in keep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Bastard of Buovo, brother to the pair,<BR>
Sir Vivian and Sir Malagigi hight:<BR>
Who him Gerardo&#8217;s lawful son declare,<BR>
Are witnesses of little worth and light.<BR>
&#8212;This, as it may!&#8212;strong, valiant, wise, and ware,<BR>
Liberal, humane, and courteous was the knight;<BR>
And on the fortress of its absent lord,<BR>
By night and day, kept faithful watch and ward.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
His cousin Richardetto, as behoved,<BR>
Was courteously received by Aldigier;<BR>
Who him as dearly as a brother loved,<BR>
And made Rogero for his sake good cheer;<BR>
But not with wonted welcome;&#8212;inly moved&#8212;<BR>
He even wore a visage sad and drear:<BR>
For he, that day, ill-tidings had received,<BR>
And hence in heart and face the warrior grieved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
To Richardetto he exclaims, instead<BR>
Of greeting: &#8220;Evil news are hither blown.<BR>
By a sure messenger, to-day I read<BR>
That faithless Bertolagi of Bayonne,<BR>
With barbarous Lanfusa has agreed,<BR>
And costly spoils makes over to that crone;<BR>
Who will consign to him the brethren twain,<BR>
Thy Malagigi and thy Viviane;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;These she, since Ferrau took them, aye has stayed<BR>
Imprisoned in a dark and evil cell;<BR>
Till the discourteous and foul pact was made<BR>
With that false Maganzese of whom I tell;<BR>
And them to-morrow, to a place conveyed<BR>
&#8217;Twixt Bayonne and a town of his, will sell<BR>
To him, who will be present, to advance<BR>
The price of the most precious blood in France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;One, at a gallop, even now, to report<BR>
Tidings to our Rinaldo of the wrong,<BR>
I sent; bur fear that he can ill resort<BR>
To him in time, the journey is so long.<BR>
Men have I not to sally from my fort;<BR>
And my power halts where my desire is strong.<BR>
The traitor will the knights, if rendered, slay;<BR>
Nor know I what to do nor what to say.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
Sir Richardetto the ill news displease,<BR>
And (as they him) displease in equal wise<BR>
Rogero; who, when silent both he sees,<BR>
Nor able any counsel to devise,<BR>
Exclaims with mickle daring: &#8220;Be at ease;<BR>
I challenge for myself the whole emprize;<BR>
And, to set free your brethren, in my hand<BR>
More than a thousand shall avail this brand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I ask not men, I ask not aid; my spear<BR>
Is, I believe, sufficient to the feat.<BR>
I only ask of you a guide to steer<BR>
Me to the place where for the exchange they meet:<BR>
I even in this place will make you hear<BR>
Their cries, who for that evil bargain threat.&#8221;<BR>
He said; nor to one listener of the twain,<BR>
That had helped his actions, spake in vain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
The other heard him not, or heard at most<BR>
As we great talkers hear, who little do:<BR>
But Richardetto took aside their host<BR>
And told how him he from the fire withdrew;<BR>
And how he was assured, beyond his boast,<BR>
He would in time and place his prowess shew.<BR>
&#8217;Twas now that better audience than before<BR>
Aldigier lent, and set by him great store;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
And at the feast, where Plenty for the three<BR>
Emptied her horn, him honoured as his lord.<BR>
Here they conclude they can the brethren free<BR>
Without more succour from their gaoler&#8217;s ward.<BR>
This while Sleep seized on lord and family,<BR>
Save young Rogero: no repose afford<BR>
To him the thoughts, which evermore molest,<BR>
And, rankling in his bosom, banish rest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
The siege of Agramant, to him that day<BR>
Told by the messenger, he has at heart.<BR>
He well discerns that every least delay<BR>
Will he dishonour. What a ceaseless smart<BR>
Will scorn inflict, what shame will him appay,<BR>
If he against his sovereign lord take part?<BR>
Oh! what foul cowardice, how foul a crime<BR>
His baptism will appear at such a time!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
That true religion had the stripling swayed<BR>
Men might at any other time conceive:<BR>
But now, when needed was the warrior&#8217;s aid<BR>
From siege the Moorish monarch to relieve,<BR>
That Fear and Baseness had more largely weighed,<BR>
In his designs, would every one believe,<BR>
That any preference of a better creed:<BR>
This thought makes good Rogero&#8217;s bosom bleed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Nor less to quit his Queen, her leave unsought,<BR>
Did with Rogero&#8217;s other griefs combine:<BR>
Now this and now that care upon him wrought;<BR>
Which diversely his doubtful heart incline:<BR>
The unhappy lover fruitlessly had thought<BR>
To find her at the abode of Flordespine;<BR>
Whither together went (as told whilere)<BR>
To succour Richardetto, maid and peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
He next bethinks him of the promise plight<BR>
To meet at Vallombrosa&#8217;s sanctuary,<BR>
Deems her gone thither, and that &#8217;twill excite<BR>
Her wonderment himself not there to see.<BR>
Could he at least a message send or write,<BR>
That he with reason might not censured be,<BR>
Because not only he had disobeyed,<BR>
But was departing hence, and nothing said!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
He, having thought on many things, in the end<BR>
Resolves on writing what behoves; and, though<BR>
He knows not how his letter he shall send,<BR>
In the assurance it will safely go,<BR>
This hinders not; he thinks that, as they wend,<BR>
Chance in his way some faithful Post may throw;<BR>
Nor more delays: up leaps the restless knight,<BR>
And calls for pen and paper, ink and light.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
That which is needed, in obedience meet,<BR>
Aldigier&#8217;s valets bring, a careful band,<BR>
The youth begins to write; and, first, to greet<BR>
The maid, as wonted courtesies demand;<BR>
Next tells how Agramant has sent to entreat,<BR>
In his dispatches, succour at his hand;<BR>
And, save he quickly to his comfort goes,<BR>
Must needs be slain or taken by his foes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Then adds, his sovereign being so bested,<BR>
And praying him for succour in his pain,<BR>
She must perceive what blame upon his head<BR>
Would light, if Agramant applied in vain;<BR>
And, since with her he is about to wed,<BR>
&#8217;Tis fitting he should keep him with stain;<BR>
For ill he deems a union could endure<BR>
Between aught foul and her to passing pure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
And if he erst a name, renowned and clear,<BR>
Had laboured to procure by actions fair,<BR>
And having gained it thus, he held it dear,<BR>
&#8212;If this had sought to keep&#8212;with greater care<BR>
He kept it now,&#8212;and with a miser&#8217;s fear<BR>
Guarded the treasure she with him would share;<BR>
Who, though distinct in body and in limb,<BR>
When wedded, ought to be one soul with him;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
And, as he erst by word, he now explained<BR>
Anew by writing, that the period o&#8217;er,<BR>
For which he was to serve his king constrained,<BR>
Unless it were his lot to die before,<BR>
He would in deed a Christian be ordained,<BR>
As in resolve he had been evermore;<BR>
And of her kin, Rinaldo and her sire,<BR>
Her afterwards in wedlock would require.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I would,&#8221; he said, &#8220;relieve, with your good will,<BR>
My king, besieged by Charlemagne&#8217;s array,<BR>
That the misjudging rabble, prone to ill,<BR>
Might never, to my shame and scandal, say:<BR>
Rogero, in fair wind and weather, still<BR>
Waited upon his sovereign, night and day,<BR>
And now that Fortune to King Charles is fled,<BR>
Has with that conquering lord his ensign spread.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I fifteen days or twenty ask, that I<BR>
Yet once again may to our army speed;<BR>
So that, by me from leaguering enemy<BR>
The African cantonments may be freed:<BR>
I will some fit and just occasion spy,<BR>
Meanwhile, to justify my change of creed,<BR>
I for my honour make this sole request;<BR>
Then wholly yours for life, in all things, rest.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
Rogero is such words his thoughts exposed,<BR>
Which never could by me be fully showed;<BR>
And added more, nor from his task reposed,<BR>
Until the crowded paper overflowed:<BR>
He next the letter folded and enclosed,<BR>
And sealed it, and within his bosom stowed;<BR>
In hopes to meet next morning by the way<BR>
One who might covertly that writ convey.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
When he had closed the sheet, that amorous knight<BR>
His eyelids closed as well, and rest ensued:<BR>
For Slumber came and steeped his wearied might<BR>
In balmy moisture, from a branch imbued<BR>
With Lethe&#8217;s water; and he slept till&#8212;white<BR>
And red&#8212;a rain of flowers the horizon strewed,<BR>
Painting the joyous east with colours gay;<BR>
When from her golden dwelling broke the day:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
And when the greenwood birds &#8217;gan, far and wide,<BR>
Greet the returning light with gladsome strain,<BR>
Sir Aldigier (who wished to be the guide,<BR>
Upon that journey, of the warlike twain,<BR>
Who would in succour of those brethren ride,<BR>
To rescue them from Bertolagi&#8217;s chain)<BR>
Was first upon his feet; and either peer<BR>
Issues as well from bed, when him they hear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
When clad and thoroughly in arms arrayed&#8212;<BR>
Rogero with the cousins took his way,<BR>
Having that pair already warmly prayed<BR>
The adventure on himself alone to lay:<BR>
But these, by love for those two brethren swayed,<BR>
And deeming it discourtesy to obey,<BR>
Stood out against his prayer, more stiff than stone,<BR>
Nor would consent that he should wend alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
True to the time and place of change, they hie<BR>
Whither Sir Aldigier&#8217;s advices teach;<BR>
And there survey an ample band who lie<BR>
Exposed to fierce Apollo&#8217;s heat; in reach,<BR>
Nor myrtle-tree nor laurel they descry,<BR>
Nor tapering cypress, ash, nor spreading beech:<BR>
But naked gravel with low shrubs discerned,<BR>
Undelved by mattock and by share unturned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Those three adventurous warriors halted where<BR>
A path went through the uncultivated plain,<BR>
And saw a knight arrive upon the lair,<BR>
Who, flourished o&#8217;er with gold, wore plate and chain,<BR>
And on green field that beauteous bird and rare,<BR>
Which longer than an age extends its reign.<BR>
No more, my lord: for at my canto&#8217;s close<BR>
I find myself arrived, and crave repose.</TD></TR>
