Hoping that shame, which to the knight appears<br />
Too foul to be endured, to wipe away:<br />
So that of Altafoglia and Poictiers,<br />
He may for ever silence the mis-say.<br />
Boldly, and in his heart secure to win<br />
That battle’s honour, wends the paladin.</td>

Nigh at the same time at the fountain-side,<br />
So in all points the pair each other greet,<br />
With countenance, so kind, so satisfied,<br />
’Twould seem by kindred and by friendship sweet<br />
Rinaldo and Gradasso were allied.<br />
But how they after closed in fierce affray,<br />
I till another season shall delay.</td>
