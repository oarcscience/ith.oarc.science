<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
After long search for good Rogero made,<BR>
Him Leon finds, and yields to him his prize:<BR>
Informed of all&#8212;already with that maid<BR>
He wives; already in her bosom lies:<BR>
When thither he that Sarza&#8217;s sceptre swayed<BR>
To infect such bliss with impious venom hies,<BR>
But falls in combat; and, blaspheming loud,<BR>
To Acheron descends his spirit proud.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
I, if my chart deceives me not, shall now<BR>
In little time behold the neighbouring shore;<BR>
So hope withal to pay my promised vow<BR>
To one, so long my guide through that wide roar<BR>
Of waters, where I feared, with troubled brow,<BR>
To scathe my bark or wander evermore.<BR>
But now, methinks&#8212;yea, now I see the land;<BR>
I see the friendly port its arms expand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
A burst of joy, like thunder to my ear,<BR>
Rumbles along the sea and rends the sky.<BR>
I chiming bells, I shrilling trumpets hear,<BR>
Confounded with the people&#8217;s cheerful cry;<BR>
And now their forms, that swarm on either pier<BR>
Of the thick-crowded harbour, I descry.<BR>
All seem rejoiced my task is smoothly done,<BR>
And I so long a course have safely run.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
What beauteous dames and sage, here welcome me!<BR>
With them what cavaliers the shore adorn!<BR>
What friends! to whom I owe eternity<BR>
Of thanks for their delight at my return.<BR>
Mamma, Ginevra, with the rest I see,<BR>
Correggio&#8217;s seed, on the harbour&#8217;s furthest horn.<BR>
Veronica de Gambara is here,<BR>
To Ph&#339;bus and the Aonian choir so dear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
With Julia, a new Ginevra is in sight,<BR>
Another offset from the selfsame tree;<BR>
Hippolita Sforza, and Trivultia bright,<BR>
Bred in the sacred cavern, I with thee<BR>
Emilia Pia, and thee, Margherite,<BR>
Angela Borgia, Graziosa, see,<BR>
And fair Richarda d&#8217;Este, Lo! the twain,<BR>
Blanche and Diana, with their sister train!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Beauteous, but wiser and more chaste than fair,<BR>
I Barbara Turca, linked with Laura, know:<BR>
Nor beams the sun upon a better pair<BR>
&#8217;Twixt Ind and where the Moorish waters flow.<BR>
Behold Ginevra! that rich gem and rare<BR>
Which gilds the house of Malatesta so,<BR>
That never worthier or more honoured thing<BR>
Adorned the dome of Keysar or of king.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
If she had dwelt in Rimini of yore,<BR>
What time, from conquered Gaul returning home,<BR>
Julius stood fearing on the river-shore,<BR>
To ford the stream and make a foe of Rome,<BR>
He every banner would have bowed before<BR>
That dame, discharged his trophies, and such doom,<BR>
Such pact would have received as liked her best;<BR>
And haply ne&#8217;er had Freedom been opprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
The consort of my lord of Bozzolo<BR>
Behold! the mother, sisters, cousinhood;<BR>
Them of Torello, Bentivoglio,<BR>
Pallavigini&#8217;s and Visconti&#8217;s brood!<BR>
Lo! she to whom all living dames forego<BR>
The palm, and all of Grecian, Latin blood,<BR>
Or barbarous, all that ever were, whose name<BR>
For grace and beauty most is noised by Fame;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
Julia Gonzaga, she that wheresoe&#8217;er<BR>
She moves, where&#8217;er she turns her lucid eyes,<BR>
Not only is in charms without a peer,<BR>
But seems a goddess lighted from the skies:<BR>
With her is paired her brother&#8217;s wife, who ne&#8217;er<BR>
Swerved from her plighted faith&#8212;aye good and wise&#8212;<BR>
Because ill Fortune bore her long despite;<BR>
Lo! Arragonian Anna, Vasto&#8217;s light!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Anne gentle, courteous, and as sage as fair,<BR>
Temple of Love and Truth and Chastity:<BR>
With her, her sister dims all beauty, where<BR>
Her radiance shines. Lo! one that hath set free<BR>
Her conquering lord from Orcus&#8217; dark repair,<BR>
And him in spite of death and destiny<BR>
(Beyond all modern instance) raised on high,<BR>
To shine with endless glory in the sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
My ladies of Ferrara, those of gay<BR>
Urbino&#8217;s court are here; and I descry<BR>
Mantua&#8217;s dames, and all that fair array<BR>
Which Lombardy and Tuscan town supply.<BR>
The cavalier amid that band, whom they<BR>
So honour, unless dazzled is mine eye<BR>
By those fair faces, is the shining light<BR>
Of his Arezzo, and Accolti hight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Adorned with scarlet hat, and scarlet pall,<BR>
His nephew Benedict, lo! there I see;<BR>
With him Campeggio and Mantua&#8217;s cardinal;<BR>
Glory and light of the consistory;<BR>
And (if I dote not) mark how one and all<BR>
In face and gesture show such mighty glee<BR>
At my return, no easy task &#8217;twould seem<BR>
So vast an obligation to redeem.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
With them Lactantius is, Claude Ptolemy,<BR>
Trissino, Pansa, and Capilupi mine,<BR>
Latino Giovenal, it seems to me;<BR>
Sasso, and Molza, and Florian hight Montine;<BR>
With him, by whom through shorter pathway we<BR>
Are led to the Ascraean font divine,<BR>
Julio Camillo; and meseems that I<BR>
Berna, and Sanga, and Flaminio spy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Lo! Alexander of Farnese, and O<BR>
Learned company that follows in his train!<BR>
Phaedro, Cappella, Maddalen&#8217;, Portio,<BR>
Surnamed the Bolognese, the Volterrane.<BR>
Blosio, Pierio, Vida, famed for flow<BR>
Of lofty eloquence of exhaustless vein;<BR>
Mussuro, Lascari, and Navagero,<BR>
And Andrew Maro, and the monk Severo.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
Lo! two more Alexanders! of the tree<BR>
Of the Orologi one, and one Guarino:<BR>
Mario d&#8217; Olvito, and of royalty<BR>
That scourge, divine Pietro Aretino.<BR>
I two Girolamos amid them see,<BR>
Of Veritade and the Cittadino;<BR>
See the Mainardo, the Leoniceno,<BR>
Panizzato, Celio, and Teocreno.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
Bernardo Capel, Peter Bembo here<BR>
I see, through whom our pure, sweet idiom rose,<BR>
And who, of vulgar usage winnowed clear,<BR>
Its genuine form in his example shows.<BR>
Behold an Obyson, that in his rear<BR>
Admires the pains which he so well bestows.<BR>
I Fracastoro, Bevezzano note,<BR>
And Tryphon Gabriel, Tasso more remote.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Upon me Nicholas Tiepoli<BR>
And Nicholas Ammanio fix their eyes;<BR>
With Anthony Fulgoso, who to spy<BR>
My boat near land shows pleasure and surprise.<BR>
There, from those dames apart, my Valery<BR>
Stands with Barignan, haply to devise<BR>
With him how, evermore by woman harmed,<BR>
By her he shall not evermore be charmed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Of high and superhuman genius, tied<BR>
By love and blood, lo! Pico and Pio true;<BR>
He that approaches at the kinsmen&#8217;s side,<BR>
&#8212;So honoured by the best&#8212;I never knew;<BR>
But, if by certain tokens signified,<BR>
He is the man I so desire to view,<BR>
That Sannazaro, who persuades the nine<BR>
To leave their fountain for the foaming brine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
Diligent, faithful secretary, lo!<BR>
The learned Pistophilus, mine Angiar here,<BR>
And the Acciajuoli their joint pleasure show<BR>
That for my bark there is no further fear.<BR>
There I my kinsman Malaguzzo know;<BR>
And mighty hope from Adoardo hear,<BR>
That these my nest-notes shall by friendly wind<BR>
Be blown from Calpe&#8217;s rock to furthest Ind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
Joys Victor Fausto; Tancred joys to view<BR>
My sail; and with them joy a hundred more.<BR>
Women and men I see, a mingled crew,<BR>
At my return rejoicing, crowd the shore.<BR>
Then, since the wind blows fair, nor much to do<BR>
Remains, let me my course delay no more;<BR>
And turning to Melissa, in what way<BR>
She rescued good Rogero let me say.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Much bent was this Melissa (as I know<BR>
I many times have said to you whilere)<BR>
That Bradamant in wedlock should bestow<BR>
Her hand upon the youthful cavalier;<BR>
And so at heart had either&#8217;s weal and woe,<BR>
That she from hour to hour of them would hear:<BR>
Hence ever on that quest she spirits sent,<BR>
One still returning as the other went.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
A prey to deep and stubborn grief, reclined<BR>
Mid gloomy shades Rogero they descried;<BR>
Firm not to swallow food of any kind,<BR>
Nor from that purpose to be turned aside;<BR>
And so to die of hunger he designed:<BR>
But weird Melissa speedy aid supplied;<BR>
Who took a road, from home forth issuing, where<BR>
She met the Grecian emperor&#8217;s youthful heir;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
Leo that, one by one, dispatched his train<BR>
Of followers, far and wide, through every bourn,<BR>
And afterwards, in person went in vain,<BR>
To find the warrior of the unicorn.<BR>
The wise enchantress, that will sell and rein,<BR>
Had on that day equipt a demon, borne<BR>
By him, in likeness of a hackney horse,<BR>
Constantine&#8217;s son encountered in her course.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If such as your ingenuous mien&#8221; (she cried<BR>
To Leo) &#8220;is your soul&#8217;s nobility,<BR>
And corresponding with your fair outside<BR>
Your inward goodness and your courtesy,<BR>
Some help, some comfort, sir, for one provide<BR>
In whom the best of living knights we see;<BR>
Who, save ye help and comfort quickly lend,<BR>
Is little distant from his latter end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The best of knights will die of all, who don,<BR>
Or e&#8217;er donned sword and buckler, the most fair<BR>
And gentle of all warriors that are gone,<BR>
Or who throughout the world yet living are,<BR>
And simply for a courteous deed, if none<BR>
Shall comfort to the youthful sufferer bear.<BR>
Then come, sir, for the love of Heaven, and try<BR>
If any counsel succour may supply.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
It suddenly came into Leo&#8217;s mind<BR>
The knight of whom she parlayed was that same,<BR>
Whom throughout all the land he sought to find,<BR>
And seeking whom, he now in person came.<BR>
So that obeying her that would persuade<BR>
Such pious work, he spurred behind the dame;<BR>
Who thither led (nor tedious was the way)<BR>
Where nigh reduced to death the stripling lay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
They found Rogero fasting from all food<BR>
For three long days, so broken down; with pain<BR>
The knight could but upon his feet have stood,<BR>
To fall, albeit unpushed, to ground again.<BR>
With helm on head, and with his faulchion good<BR>
Begirt, he lay reclined in plate and chain.<BR>
A pillow of his buckler had he made,<BR>
Where the white unicorn was seen pourtraid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
There thinking what an injury he had done<BR>
To his lady love&#8212;how ingrate, how untrue<BR>
To her had been&#8212;not simple grief alone<BR>
O&#8217;erwhelmed him, to such height his fury grew,<BR>
He bit his hands and lips; while pouring down<BR>
His cheeks, the tears unceasing ran, and through<BR>
The passion that so wrapt his troubled sprite,<BR>
Nor Leo nor Melissa heard the knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
Nor therefore interrupts he his lament,<BR>
Nor checks his sighs, nor checks his trickling tears.<BR>
Young Leo halts, to hear his speech intent;<BR>
Lights from his courser, and towards him steers:<BR>
He knows that of the sorrows which torment<BR>
Love is the cause; but yet from nought appears<BR>
Who is the person that such grief hath bred;<BR>
For by Rogero this remains unsaid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
Approaching nearer and yet nearer, now<BR>
He fronts the weeping warrior, face to face,<BR>
Greets with a brother&#8217;s love, and stooping low,<BR>
His neck encircles with a fast embrace.<BR>
By the lamenting Child I know not how<BR>
Is liked his sudden presence in that place;<BR>
Who fears annoy or trouble at his hand;<BR>
And lest he should his wish for death withstand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Him with the sweetest words young Leo plied,<BR>
And with the warmest love that he could show,<BR>
&#8220;Let it not irk thee,&#8221; to the Child he cried,<BR>
&#8220;To tell the cause from whence thy sorrows flow;<BR>
For few such desperate evils man betide,<BR>
But that there is deliverance from his woe,<BR>
So that the cause be known; nor he bereft<BR>
Of hope should ever be, so life be left.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Much grieve I thou wouldst hide thyself from me,<BR>
That known me for thy faithful friend and true;<BR>
Not only now I am so bound to thee,<BR>
That I the knot can never more undo;<BR>
But even from the beginning, when to be<BR>
Thy deadly foeman I had reason due.<BR>
Hope then that I will succour thee with pelf,<BR>
With friends, with following, and with life itself.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor shun to me thy sorrow to explain,<BR>
And I beseech thee leave to me to try<BR>
If wealth avail to free thee from thy pain,<BR>
Art, cunning, open force, or flattery,<BR>
If my assistance is employed in vain,<BR>
The last relief remains to thee to die:<BR>
But be content awhile this deed to shun<BR>
Till all that thou canst do shall first be done.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
He said; and with such forceful prayer appealed;<BR>
So gently and benignly soothed his moan;<BR>
That good Rogero could not choose but yield,<BR>
Whose heart was not of iron or of stone;<BR>
Who deemed, unless he now his lips unsealed,<BR>
He should a foul discourteous deed have done.<BR>
He fain would have replied, but made assay<BR>
Yet twice or thrice, ere words could find their way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;My lord, when known for what I am (and me<BR>
Now shalt thou know),&#8221; he made at last reply,<BR>
&#8220;I wot thou, like myself, content wilt be,<BR>
And haply more content, that I should die.<BR>
Know me for him so hated once by thee;<BR>
Rogero who repaid that hate am I;<BR>
And now &#8217;tis many days since with intent<BR>
Of putting thee to death from court I went.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Because I would not see my promised bride<BR>
Borne off by thee; in that Duke Aymon&#8217;s love<BR>
And favour was engaged upon thy side.<BR>
But, for man purposes, and God above<BR>
Disposes, thy great courtesy, well tried<BR>
In a sore need, my fixt resolve did move.<BR>
Nor only I renounced the hate I bore,<BR>
But purposed to be thine for evermore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;What time I as Rogero was unknown,<BR>
Thou madest suit I would obtain for thee<BR>
The Lady Bradamant; which was all one<BR>
As to demand my heart and soul from me.<BR>
Whether thy wish I rather than mine own<BR>
Sought to content, thou hast been made to see.<BR>
Thine is the lady; her in peace possess;<BR>
Far more than mine I prize thy happiness.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Content thee, that deprived of her, as well<BR>
I should myself of worthless life deprive;<BR>
For better I without a soul could dwell<BR>
Than without Bradamant remain alive.<BR>
And never while these veins with life-blood swell<BR>
Canst thou with her legitimately wive:<BR>
For vows erewhile have been between us said;<BR>
Nor she at once can with two husbands wed.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
So filled is gentle Leo with amaze<BR>
When he the stranger for Rogero knows,<BR>
With lips and brow unmoved, with stedfast gaze<BR>
And rooted feet, he like a statue shows;<BR>
Like statue more than man, which votaries raise<BR>
In churches, for acquittance of their vows.<BR>
He deems that courtesy of so high a strain<BR>
Was never done nor will be done again;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
And that he him doth for Rogero know<BR>
Not only that goodwill he bore whilere<BR>
Abates not, but augments his kindness so,<BR>
That no less grieves the Grecian cavalier<BR>
Than good Rogero for Rogero&#8217;s woe.<BR>
For this, as well as that he will appear<BR>
Deservedly an emperor&#8217;s son&#8212;although<BR>
In other things outdone&#8212;he will not be<BR>
Defeated in the race of courtesy;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
And says, &#8220;That day my host was overthrown,<BR>
Rogero, by thy wond&#8217;rous valour, though<BR>
I had thee at despite, if I had known<BR>
Thou was Rogero, as I know it now,<BR>
So me thy virtue would have made thine own,<BR>
As then it made me, knowing not my foe;<BR>
So hatred from my bosom would have chased,<BR>
And with my present love have straight replaced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That I Rogero hated, ere I knew<BR>
Thou was Rogero, will I not deny.<BR>
But think not that I further would pursue<BR>
The hatred that I bore thee; and had I,<BR>
When thee I from thy darksome dungeon drew,<BR>
Descried the truth, as this I now descry,<BR>
Such treatment shouldst thou then have had, as thou<BR>
Shalt have from me, to thine advantage, now;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And if I willingly had done so then,<BR>
When not, as I am now, obliged to thee;<BR>
How much more gladly should I now; and when,<BR>
Not doing so, I should with reason be<BR>
Deemed most ungrateful amid ingrate men;<BR>
Since thou foregoest thine every good for me!<BR>
But I to thee restore thy gift, and, more<BR>
Glady than I received it, this restore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The damsel more to thee than me is due;<BR>
And though for her deserts I hold her dear,<BR>
If that fair prize some happier mortal drew,<BR>
I think not I my vital thread should shear:<BR>
Nor would I by thy death be free to woo:<BR>
That from the hallowed bands of wedlock clear<BR>
Wherein the lady hath to thee been tied,<BR>
I might possess her as my lawful bride.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not only Bradamant would I forego,<BR>
But whatsoe&#8217;er I in the world possess;<BR>
And rather forfeit life than ever know<BR>
That grief, through me, should such a knight oppress.<BR>
To me is thy distrust great cause of woe,<BR>
That since thou couldst dispose of me no less<BR>
Than of thyself, thou&#8212;rather than apply<BR>
To me for succour&#8212;wouldst of sorrow die.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
These words he spake, and more to that intent,<BR>
Too tedious in these verses to recite;<BR>
Refuting evermore such argument<BR>
As might be used in answer by the knight:<BR>
Who said, at last, &#8220;I yield, and am content<BR>
To live; but how can I ever requite<BR>
The obligation, which by me is owed<BR>
To thee that twice hast life on me bestowed?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
Melissa generous wine and goodly cheer<BR>
Thither bade carry, in a thought obeyed;<BR>
And comforted the mourning cavalier,<BR>
Who would have sunk without her friendly aid.<BR>
Meanwhile the sound of steeds Frontino&#8217;s ear<BR>
Had reached, and thither had he quickly made:<BR>
Him Leo&#8217;s squires at his commandment caught,<BR>
And saddled, and to good Rogero brought;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
Who, though by Leo helped, with much ado<BR>
And labour sore the gentle courser scaled.<BR>
So wasted was the vigour which some few<BR>
Short days before, in fighting field, availed<BR>
To overthrow a banded host, and do<BR>
The deeds he did, in cheating armour mailed.<BR>
Departing thence, ere they had measured more<BR>
Than half a league, they reached an abbey hoar:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Wherein what of that day was yet unworn<BR>
They past, the morrow, and succeeding day;<BR>
Until the warrior of the unicorn<BR>
His vigour had recruited by the stay.<BR>
He, Leo, and Melissa then return<BR>
To Charles&#8217;s royal residence; where lay<BR>
An embassy, arrived the eve before,<BR>
Which from the Bulgars&#8217; land a message bore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
Since they that had for king proclaimed the knight<BR>
Besought Rogero thither to repair<BR>
Through these their envoys deeming they would light<BR>
On him in Charles&#8217;s court, where they should swear<BR>
Fidelity, and yield to him his right;<BR>
And he from them the crown receive and wear.<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s squire who served this band to steer<BR>
Has published tidings of the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
He of the fight has told which at Belgrade<BR>
Erewhile Rogero for the Bulgars won;<BR>
How Leo and his sire were overlaid,<BR>
And all their army slaughtered and undone;<BR>
Wherefore the Bulgars him their king had made;<BR>
Their royal line excluding from the throne:<BR>
Then how Ungiardo took the warrior brave,<BR>
And him to cruel Theodora gave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
He speaks with that of certain news, which say<BR>
How good Rogero&#8217;s jailer was found dead,<BR>
The prison broke and prisoner away:<BR>
Of what became of him was nothing said.<BR>
&#8212;Towards the city by a secret way<BR>
(Nor was his visage seen) Rogero sped.<BR>
He, on the following morning, and his friend,<BR>
Leo, to Charles&#8217;s court together wend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
To Charles&#8217; court he wends; the bird he bore<BR>
Of gold with its two heads&#8212;of crimson hue<BR>
Its field&#8212;and that same vest and ensigns wore,<BR>
As was erewhile devised between the two;<BR>
And such as in the listed fight before<BR>
His bruised and battered armour was in shew.<BR>
So that they quickly knew the cavalier<BR>
From him that strove with Bradamant whilere.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
In royal ornaments and costly gown,<BR>
Unarmed, beside him doth young Leo fare.<BR>
A worthy following and of high renown<BR>
Before, behind him, and about him are.<BR>
He bowed to Charlemagne, who from his throne<BR>
Had risen to do honour to the pair:<BR>
Then holding still Rogero by the hand,<BR>
So spake, while all that warrior closely scanned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Behold the champion good, that did maintain<BR>
From dawn till fall of day the furious fight;<BR>
And since by Bradamant nor taken, slain,<BR>
Nor forced beyond the barriers was the knight,<BR>
He is assured his victory is plain,<BR>
Dread sir, if he your edict reads aright;<BR>
And he hath won the lady for his wife:<BR>
So comes to claim the guerdon of the strife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Besides that by your edict&#8217;s tenor none<BR>
But him can to the damsel lift his eyes,<BR>
&#8212;Is she deserved by deeds of valour done,<BR>
What other is so worthy of the prize?<BR>
&#8212;Should she by him that loves her best be won,<BR>
None passes him, nor with the warrior vies;<BR>
And he is here to fight against all foes<BR>
That would in arms his right in her oppose.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
King Charlemagne and all his peerage stand<BR>
Amazed, who well believed the Grecian peer<BR>
With Bradamant had striven with lifted brand<BR>
In fight, and not that unknown cavalier.<BR>
Marphisa, thither borne amid the band,<BR>
That crowded round the royal chair to hear,<BR>
Hardly till Leo made an ending staid;<BR>
Then prest before the listening troop, and said:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Since here Rogero is not, to contest<BR>
The bride&#8217;s possession with the stranger knight,<BR>
Lest he, as undefended, be opprest,<BR>
And forfeit so without dispute his right,<BR>
On his behalf I undertake this quest,<BR>
&#8212;His sister I&#8212;against whatever wight<BR>
Shall here assert a claim to Bradamant,<BR>
Or more desert than good Rogero vaunt.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
She spake this with such anger and disdain,<BR>
Many surmised amid the assistant crew,<BR>
That, without waiting leave from Charlemagne,<BR>
What she had threatened she forthwith would do.<BR>
No longer Leo deemed it time to feign;<BR>
And from Rogero&#8217;s head the helm withdrew;<BR>
And to Marphisa, &#8220;For himself to speak,<BR>
Behold him here and ready!&#8221; cried the Greek.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
As looked old Aegeus at the accursed board,<BR>
Seeing it was his son to whom&#8212;so willed<BR>
His wicked consort&#8212;that Athenian lord<BR>
Had given the juice from deadly drugs distilled;<BR>
Whom he, if he had recognized his sword<BR>
Though but a little later, would have killed;<BR>
So looked Marphisa when, disclosed to view,<BR>
She in the stranger knight Rogero knew;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
And ran forthwith to clip the cavalier;<BR>
Nor could unclasp her arms: with loving show<BR>
Charlemagne, Roland, and Rinaldo, here<BR>
And there, fix friendly kisses on his brow.<BR>
Nor him Sir Dudon, nor Sir Olivier,<BR>
Nor King Sobrino can caress enow:<BR>
Nor paladin nor peer, amid the crew,<BR>
Wearies of welcoming that warrior true.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
Leo, who well can play the spokesman, now<BR>
That warlike band hath ceased to clip the knight,<BR>
Tells before Charles and all that audience, how<BR>
Rogero&#8217;s daring, how Rogero&#8217;s might,<BR>
&#8212;Albeit to his good squadron&#8217;s scathe and woe&#8212;<BR>
Which at Belgrade he witnessed in that fight,<BR>
So moved him that they overweighed all harms<BR>
Inflicted on him by the warrior&#8217;s arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
So that to her Rogero being brought,<BR>
Who would all havoc of the youth have made,<BR>
He setting all his family at nought,<BR>
Had out of durance vile the knight conveyed;<BR>
And how Rogero, that the rescue wrought<BR>
By Leo might be worthily repaid,<BR>
Did that high courtesy; which can by none,<BR>
That ever were or e&#8217;er will be, outdone;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
And he from point to point continuing, said<BR>
That which Rogero had for him achieved;<BR>
And after, how by sorrow sore bested,<BR>
In that to leave his cherished wife he grieved,<BR>
He had resolved to die, and, almost dead,<BR>
Was only by his timely aid relieved;<BR>
And this he told so movingly, no eye<BR>
Remained, amid those martial many, dry.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
So efficaciously he after prayed<BR>
To the obstinate Duke Aymon, not alone<BR>
The stubborn sire of Bradamant he swayed,<BR>
And to forego his settled purpose won;<BR>
But that proud lord in person did persuade<BR>
To beg Rogero&#8217;s pardon, and his son<BR>
And son-in-law to be beseech the knight;<BR>
And thus to him his Bradamant was plight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
To her, where, of her feeble life in doubt,<BR>
She in a secret chamber made lament,<BR>
Through many a messenger, with joyful shout<BR>
And mickle haste, the happy tidings went.<BR>
Hence the warm blood, that stagnated about<BR>
Her heart, by her first sorrow thither sent,<BR>
Ebbed at this notice in so full a tide,<BR>
Well nigh for sudden joy the damsel died.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
Of all her vigour is she so foregone,<BR>
She cannot on her feeble feet rely:<BR>
Yet what her force must needs to you be known,<BR>
And what the damsel&#8217;s magnanimity.<BR>
None doomed to prison, wheel or halter, none<BR>
Condemned some other evil death to die,<BR>
About whose brows the sable band is tied,<BR>
Rejoices more to hear his pardon cried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
Joys Clermont&#8217;s, joys Mongrana&#8217;s noble house,<BR>
Those kindred branches that fresh know to view.<BR>
With equal grief Count Anselm overflows,<BR>
Gan, Falcon, Gini and Ginami&#8217;s crew:<BR>
Yet they meanwhile beneath contented brows<BR>
Conceal the dark and envious thoughts they brew.<BR>
As the fox waits the motions of the hare,<BR>
They wait their time for vengeance, and forbear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
Besides that oftentimes before the rage<BR>
Of Roland and Rinaldo on them fell,<BR>
Though they were calmed by Charles&#8217;s counsel sage,<BR>
And common danger from the infidel,<BR>
They had new cause for grief in Bertolage<BR>
Slain by their foemen and Sir Pinnabel:<BR>
But they concealed their hatred, and endured<BR>
Those griefs, as of the matter ill assured.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
Those envoys of the Bulgars that had made<BR>
For Charles&#8217;s court (as hath erewhile been shown),<BR>
Hoping to find the knight, whose shield pourtrayed<BR>
The unicorn, elected to their throne,<BR>
Bless the good fortune which their hope repayed,<BR>
Seeing that valiant warrior, and fall down<BR>
Before his feet, and him in humble speech<BR>
Again to seek their Bulgary beseech;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Where kept for him in Adrianople are<BR>
The sceptre and the crown, his royal due:<BR>
But let him succour to his kingdom bear;<BR>
For&#8212;to their further scathe&#8212;advices shew<BR>
Constantine doth a mighty host prepare,<BR>
And thitherward in person moves anew;<BR>
And they&#8212;of their elected king possest&#8212;<BR>
Hope the Greek empire from his hands to wrest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
He accepts the realm, by their entreaties won;<BR>
And, to afford them aid against their foes,<BR>
Will went to Bulgary when three months are done;<BR>
Save Fortune otherwise of him dispose.<BR>
When this is heard by that Greek emperor&#8217;s son,<BR>
He bids Rogero on his faith repose;<BR>
For since by him the Bulgar&#8217;s realm is swayed,<BR>
Peace between them and Constantine is made;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Nor needeth he depart in haste, to guide<BR>
His Bulgar bands against the Grecian foe;<BR>
For all that he had conquered far and wide,<BR>
He will persuade his father to forego.<BR>
None of the virtues, in Rogero spied,<BR>
Moved Bradamant&#8217;s ambitious mother so,<BR>
Or so to endear her son-in-law availed,<BR>
As hearing now that son a sovereign hailed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
The rich and royal nuptials they prepare<BR>
As well befits him, by whose care &#8217;tis done,<BR>
&#8217;Tis done by Charles; and with such cost and care<BR>
As if &#8217;twere for a daughter of his own.<BR>
For such the merits of the damsel are,<BR>
And such had all her martial kindred shown,<BR>
Charles would not think he should exceed due measure<BR>
If spent for her was half his kingdom&#8217;s treasure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
He a free court bids cry; whither his way<BR>
Securely every one that wills may wend;<BR>
And offers open lists till the ninth day<BR>
To whosoever would in arms contend;<BR>
And bids build bowers afield, and interlay<BR>
Green boughs therein, and flowers and foliage blend;<BR>
And make those bowers so gay with silk and gold,<BR>
No fairer place this ample world doth hold.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Guested within fair Paris cannot be<BR>
The countless foreign bands that thither fare;<BR>
Who, rich and poor, of high and low degree,<BR>
And Greeks and Latins and Barbarians are.<BR>
There is no end of lord and embassy<BR>
That thither from all ends of earth repair;<BR>
All lodged conveniently, to their content,<BR>
Beneath pavilion, booth, and bower and tent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
The weird Melissa against the coming night<BR>
With singular and matchless ornament<BR>
Had for that pair the nuptial chamber dight;<BR>
Whereon long time before she had been bent:<BR>
Long time before desirous of the rite<BR>
Had been that dame, presageful of the event;<BR>
Presageful of futurity, she knew<BR>
What goodly fruit should from their stems ensue.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
She had prepared the genial, fruitful bed,<BR>
Under a broad pavilion; one more rich,<BR>
Adorned, and jocund, never overhead<BR>
(Did this for peace or war its master pitch)<BR>
Was in the world, before or after, spread;<BR>
And this from Thracian strand had borne the witch.<BR>
The costly prize from Constantine she bore,<BR>
Who for disport was tented on that shore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
She with young Leo&#8217;s leave, or rather so<BR>
The Grecian&#8217;s admiration to obtain,<BR>
And a rare token of that art to show,<BR>
Which on Hell&#8217;s mighty dragon puts the rein,<BR>
And at her pleasure rules that impious foe<BR>
Of Heaven, together with his evil train,<BR>
Bade demons the pavilion through mid air<BR>
To Paris from Constantinople bear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
From Constantine that lay therein, who swayed<BR>
The Grecian empire&#8217;s sceptre, at mid-day<BR>
This with its cordage, shaft whereby &#8217;twas stayed,<BR>
And all within and out, she bore away;<BR>
And of the costly tent, through air conveyed,<BR>
For young Rogero made a lodging gay.<BR>
The bridal ended, this her demon crew<BR>
Thither, from whence &#8217;twas brought, conveyed anew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
Two thousand tedious years were nigh complete,<BR>
Since this fair work was fashioned by the lore<BR>
Of Trojan maid, warmed with prophetic heat;<BR>
Who, &#8217;mid long labour and &#8217;mid vigil sore,<BR>
With her own fingers all the storied sheet<BR>
Of the pavilion had embroidered o&#8217;er;<BR>
Cassandra hight; that maid to Hector brave<BR>
(Her brother he) this costly present gave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
The curtiest cavalier, the kindliest shoot<BR>
That ever from her brother&#8217;s stock should grow<BR>
(Albeit she knew far distant from its root,<BR>
With many a branch between, should be that bough)<BR>
In silk and gold upon the gorgeous suit<BR>
Of hangings had she wrought in goodly show.<BR>
Much prized that gift, while living, Priam&#8217;s son,<BR>
For its rare work and her by whom &#8217;twas done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
But when by treachery perished Priam&#8217;s heir,<BR>
And Greeks the Trojans scathed in cruel sort,<BR>
When her gates opened by false Sinon were,<BR>
And direr ill was done than tales report,<BR>
This plunder fell to Menelaus&#8217; share,<BR>
Wherewith to Egypt&#8217;s land he made resort;<BR>
There left it to King Proteus, Egypt&#8217;s lord,<BR>
In ransom for his prisoned wife restored;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
She Helen hight: her Menelaus to free,<BR>
To Proteus the pavilion gave away;<BR>
Which, passing through the line of Ptolemy,<BR>
To Cleopatra fell; from her in fray<BR>
Agrippa&#8217;s band on the Leucadian sea<BR>
Bore off the treasure, amid other prey.<BR>
Augustus and Tiberius heired the loom,<BR>
Kept till the time of Constantine in Rome:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
That Constantine, whom thou shall ever rue<BR>
Fair Italy, while the heavens above are rolled.<BR>
Constantine to Byzantium, when he grew<BR>
Weary of Tyber, bore the tent of old.<BR>
Melissa from his namesake this withdrew,<BR>
Its pole of ivory and its cord of gold,<BR>
And all its cloth with beauteous figures fraught;<BR>
Fairer Apelles&#8217; pencil never wrought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Here the three Graces in gay vesture gowned<BR>
Assisted the delivery of a queen.<BR>
Not in four ages in this earthly round<BR>
Was ever born a boy so fair of mien.<BR>
Jove, Venus, Mars, and Mercury renowned<BR>
For fluent speech, about the child are seen:<BR>
Him have they strewed, and stew with heaven&#8217;s perfume,<BR>
Ambrosial odours and aetherial bloom.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
Hippolytus a little label said,<BR>
Inscribed upon the baby&#8217;s swaddling clothes.<BR>
By the hand him Fortune leads in age more staid;<BR>
And Valour as a guide before him goes.<BR>
An unknown band in sweeping vest arraid,<BR>
With long descending locks, the tapestry shows,<BR>
Deputed by Corvinus to desire<BR>
The tender infant from his princely sire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
He reverently parts from Hercules&#8217; side,<BR>
From her, his lady mother, Eleanor;<BR>
And to the Danube wends; where far and wide<BR>
They meet the boy, and as a god adore.<BR>
The prudent king of Hungary is descried,<BR>
Who does due honour to his ripened lore,<BR>
In yet unripe, yea, raw and tender years,<BR>
And ranks the stripling above all his peers.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
One is there that in his green age and new<BR>
Places Strigonia&#8217;s crozier in his hand.<BR>
Him ever at Corvinus&#8217; side we view;<BR>
Whether he doth in court or camp command,<BR>
Whether against the Turk, or German crew<BR>
The puissant monarch leads his martial band,<BR>
Watchful Hippolytus is at his side,<BR>
And gathers virtue from his generous guide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
There is it seen, how he his blooming age<BR>
Divides mid arts and wholesome discipline:<BR>
The secret spirit of the ancient page<BR>
There Fuscus well instructs him to divine:<BR>
&#8220;This must thou shun, that follow&#8221;&#8212;seems the sage<BR>
To say&#8212;&#8220;if thou immortally wouldst shine.&#8221;<BR>
Fashioned withal with so much skill and care<BR>
By her who wrought that work, their gestures were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
A cardinal he next is seen, though young<BR>
In years, at council in the Vatican;<BR>
Where for deep wisdom graced by eloquent tongue,<BR>
With wonder him the assembled conclave scan.<BR>
&#8220;What will he be&#8221;&#8212;they seem to say among<BR>
Themselves&#8212;&#8220;when he is ripened into man?<BR>
Oh! if on him St. Peter&#8217;s mantle fall,<BR>
What a blest aera! what a happy call!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
That brave youth&#8217;s liberal pastimes are designed<BR>
In other place; on Alpine mountain hoar<BR>
Here he affronts the bear of rugged kind;<BR>
And there in rushy bottom bays the boar:<BR>
Now on his jennet he outgoes the wind,<BR>
And drives some goat or gallant hind before;<BR>
Which falls o&#8217;ertaken on the dusty plain,<BR>
By his descending faulchion cleft in twain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
He is descried, amid a fair array<BR>
Of poets and philosophers elsewhere<BR>
This pricks for him the wandering planets&#8217; way;<BR>
These earth, these heaven for his instruction square.<BR>
Some chant sad elegies, some verses gay<BR>
Lays lyric or heroic; singers there<BR>
He with rich music hears; nor moves a pace<BR>
But what in every step is sovereign grace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
The first part of the storied walls pourtraied<BR>
That noble prince&#8217;s gentle infancy.<BR>
Cassandra all beside had overlaid<BR>
With fears of justice, prudence, modesty,<BR>
Valour, and that fifty virtue, which hath made<BR>
With those fair sisters closest amity;<BR>
I speak of her that gives and that bestows.<BR>
With all these virtues gilt, the stripling glows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
In this part is the princely youth espied<BR>
With that unhappy duke, the Insubri&#8217;s head;<BR>
In peace they sit in council at his side,<BR>
Together armed, the serpent-banner spread.<BR>
The youth by one unchanging faith is tied<BR>
To him for ever, well or ill bested;<BR>
His followers still in flight before the foe,<BR>
His guide in peril, his support in woe.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Him in another quarter you descry,<BR>
For his Ferrara and her duke in fear,<BR>
Who by strange proofs doth sift, and certify<BR>
To his just brother, vouched by tokens clear,<BR>
The close device of that ill treachery,<BR>
Hatched by those kinsmen whom he held most dear;<BR>
Hence justly he becomes that title&#8217;s heir,<BR>
Which Rome yet free bade righteous Tully bear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Elsewhere in martial panoply he shone,<BR>
Hasting to help the church with lifted blade;<BR>
With scanty and tumultuous levy gone<BR>
Against well-ordered host in arms arraid:<BR>
And lo! the coming of that chief alone<BR>
Affords the priestly band such present aid,<BR>
Extinguished are the fires before they spread.<BR>
He came, he saw, he conquered, may be said.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Elsewhere he stands upon his native strand,<BR>
Fighting against the mightiest armament,<BR>
That whensoever against Argive land,<BR>
Or Turkish, from Venetian harbour went;<BR>
Scatters and overthrows the hostile band,<BR>
And&#8212;spoil and prisoners to his brother sent&#8212;<BR>
Nothing reserves save that unfading bay;<BR>
The only prize he cannot give away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
Upon those figures gazed the courtly crew,<BR>
But read no meaning in the storied wall:<BR>
Because there was not any one to shew<BR>
That these were things hereafter to befall.<BR>
Those fair and quaintly fashioned forms they view<BR>
With pleasure, and peruse the scrolls withal:<BR>
But Bradamant, to whom the whole was known,<BR>
By wise Melissa taught, rejoiced alone.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Though not instructed in that history<BR>
Like gentle Bradamant, the affianced knight<BR>
Remembers how amid his progeny<BR>
Atlantes often praised this Hippolyte.<BR>
&#8212;Who faithfully could verse such courtesy,<BR>
As Charlemagne vouchsafed to every wight?<BR>
With various games that solemn feast was cheered,<BR>
And charged with viands aye the board appeared.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
Who is a valiant knight, is here descried;<BR>
For daily broke a thousand lances lay:<BR>
Singly to combat or in troops they ride;<BR>
On horseback or afoot, they mix in fray.<BR>
Worthiest of all Rogero is espied,<BR>
Who always conquers, jousting night and day;<BR>
And so, in wrestling, dance, and every deed,<BR>
Still from its rivals bears away the meed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
On the last day, when at their festive cheer<BR>
Was seated solemnly the assembled band,<BR>
Where at Charles&#8217; left was placed the wedded peer,<BR>
And Bradamant upon his better hand,<BR>
Across the fields an armed cavalier,<BR>
Of semblance haughty, and of stature grand,<BR>
Was seen to ride towards the royal table;<BR>
Himself and courser wholly clothed in sable.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
The King of Argier he; that for the scorn<BR>
Received from her, when on the bridge he fell,<BR>
Never to clothe himself in arms had sworn,<BR>
Nor draw the faulchion nor bestride the sell,<BR>
Till he had like an anchoret outworn<BR>
A year and month and day in lowly cell.<BR>
So to chastise themselves for such like crimes<BR>
Were cavaliers accustomed in those times.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
Albeit of Charles and Agramant the Moor<BR>
Had heard the several fortunes while away,<BR>
Not to foreswear himself, he armed no more<BR>
Than if in nought concerned in that affray:<BR>
But when the year and month were wholly o&#8217;er,<BR>
And wholly past was the succeeding day,<BR>
With other courser, harness, sword, and lance,<BR>
The king betook him to the court of France.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
He neither lighted from his horse, nor bowed<BR>
His head; and, without sign of reverence due,<BR>
His scorn for Charlemagne by gestures showed,<BR>
And the high presence of so fair a crew.<BR>
Astound and full of wonder stood the crowd,<BR>
Such license in that haughty man to view.<BR>
All leave their meat, all leave their talk, to hear<BR>
The purpose of the stranger cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
To Charles and to Rogero opposite,<BR>
With a loud voice, and in proud accent, &#8220;I<BR>
Am Rodomont of Sarza,&#8221; said the knight,<BR>
&#8220;Who thee, Rogero, to the field defy;<BR>
And here, before the sun withdraws his light,<BR>
Will prove on thee thine infidelity;<BR>
And that thou, as a traitor to thy lord,<BR>
Deserv&#8217;st not any honour at this board.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Albeit thy felony be plain and clear,<BR>
Which thou, as christened, canst not disavow;<BR>
Nathless to make it yet more plain appear,<BR>
This will I prove upon thee; and, if thou<BR>
Canst find a knight to combat for thee here,<BR>
Him will accept;&#8212;if one be not enow&#8212;<BR>
Will four, nay six accept; and will maintain<BR>
My words against them all in listed plain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
Rogero, with the leave of Pepin&#8217;s son,<BR>
Uprose at that appeal, and thus replied:<BR>
That he&#8212;nor he alone&#8212;but every one,<BR>
Who thus impeached him as a traitor, lied;<BR>
That so he by his king had ever done,<BR>
Him none could justly blame; and on his side,<BR>
He was prepared in listed field to shew<BR>
He evermore by him had done his due.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
He can defend himself; nor need he crave<BR>
Another warrior&#8217;s help that course to run;<BR>
And &#8217;tis his hope to show him he would have<BR>
Enough, perhaps would have too much, of one.<BR>
Thither Orlando and Rinaldo, brave<BR>
Olivier, and his white and sable son,<BR>
Thither good Dudon and Marphisa wend;<BR>
Who fain with that fierce paynim will contend.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
They tell Rogero that, as newly wed<BR>
The combat he in person should refuse.<BR>
&#8220;Take ye no further pains,&#8221; the warrior said,<BR>
&#8220;For such would be for me a foul excuse.&#8221;<BR>
The Tartar&#8217;s arms were brought, which cut the thread<BR>
Of more delay and of all further truce:<BR>
With spurs Orlando deck&#8217;d the youthful lord,<BR>
King Charlemagne begirt him with the sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CX.</TD><TD>
Marphisa and Bradamant in corslet case<BR>
His breast, and clothe him in his other gear.<BR>
Astolpho led his horse of noble race:<BR>
Sir Dudon held his stirrup: far and near<BR>
Rinaldo and Namus made the mob give place,<BR>
Assisted by the Marquis Olivier.<BR>
All from the crowded lists they drive with speed,<BR>
Evermore kept in order for such need.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
The pale-faced dames and damsels troop, in guise<BR>
Of pigeons round the lists, a timid show;<BR>
When, homeward bound, from fruitful field they rise,<BR>
Scared by wide-sweeping winds, which loudly blow,<BR>
Mid flash and clap; and when the sable skies<BR>
Threat hail and rain, the harvest&#8217;s waste and woe:<BR>
A timid troop, they for Rogero fear,<BR>
Ill matched they deem with that fierce cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
So him deemed all the rabble; and so most<BR>
Of those bold cavalier and barons thought;<BR>
In that they had not yet the memory lost<BR>
Of what that paynim had in Paris wrought,<BR>
When singly fire and sword the warrior tost,<BR>
And much of that fair town to ruin brought;<BR>
Whose signs remained, and yet will long remain:<BR>
Nor ever greater havoc plagued that reign.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
Bradamant&#8217;s heart above those others&#8217; beat:<BR>
Not that she deemed the Saracen in might,<BR>
Or valour which in the heart-core hath its seat,<BR>
Was of more prowess than the youthful knight;<BR>
Nor (what oft gives success in martial feat<BR>
That with the paynim was the better right.<BR>
Yet cannot she her some ill misgivings quell.<BR>
But upon those that love such fear sits well.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
Oh! in her fear for him, how willingly<BR>
She battle for Rogero would have done!<BR>
If lifeless on the listed field to lie<BR>
Surer than sure,&#8212;in fight with Ulien&#8217;s son.<BR>
More than one death would she consent to die,<BR>
If she withal could suffer more than one,<BR>
Rather than she in that unhappy strife<BR>
Would see her cherished consort risk his life.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
But prayer availed not on the damsel&#8217;s part<BR>
To make Rogero leave to her the quest:<BR>
She then with mournful face and beating heart<BR>
Stood by to view that pair to fight addrest.<BR>
From right and left the peer and paynim start,<BR>
And at each other run with lance in rest.<BR>
The spears seem ice, as they in shivers fly.<BR>
The fragments birds, that mount through middle sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
Rodomont&#8217;s lance which smote in the career<BR>
Upon mid-shield, yet harmed it little; so<BR>
Perfect was famous Hector&#8217;s iron gear,<BR>
Hardened by Vulcan&#8217;s hand, and safe from blow.<BR>
As well against the shield his levelled spear<BR>
Rogero guides, and that good buckler&#8212;though<BR>
Well steeled within and out, with bone between,<BR>
And nigh a palm in thickness&#8212;pierces clean;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
And&#8212;but his lance resists not that fierce shock,<BR>
And at the first assault its splinters fly,<BR>
And bits and fragments of the shivered stock<BR>
Seem fledged with feathers they ascend so high;<BR>
Were his arms hewn from adamantine rock,<BR>
The spear would pierce the paynim&#8217;s panoply;<BR>
And end that battle: but it breaks withal,<BR>
And on their croups both staggering coursers fall.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
With bridle and with spur the martial pair<BR>
Raise their proud horses nimbly from the ground;<BR>
And having broke their spears, with faulchions bare<BR>
Return, to bandy fierce and cruel wound.<BR>
Wheeling with wondrous mastery, here and there,<BR>
The bold and ready coursers in a round,<BR>
The warriors with their biting swords begin<BR>
To try where either&#8217;s armour is most thin.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
Rodomont had not that hard dragon-hide<BR>
Which heretofore had cased the warrior&#8217;s breast;<BR>
Nor Nimrod&#8217;s trenchant sword was at his side;<BR>
Nor the accustomed helm his temples prest.<BR>
For on that bridge which spanned the narrow tide,<BR>
A loser to Dordona&#8217;s lady, vest<BR>
And arms suspended from the votive stone<BR>
He left; as I, meseems, erewhile have shown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
Clad was the king in other goodly mail;<BR>
Yet not like that first panoply secure:<BR>
But neither this, nor that, nor harder scale<BR>
Could Balisarda&#8217;s deadly dint endure;<BR>
Against which neither workmanship avail,<BR>
Enchantment, temper, nor prime steel and pure.<BR>
So here so there Rogero plied his sword,<BR>
He more than once the paynim&#8217;s armour bored.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
When Rodomont beholds in that fierce close<BR>
His widely crimsoned arms, nor can restrain<BR>
The greater portion of those griding blows<BR>
From biting to the quick, through plate and chain,<BR>
He with more fury, with more rage o&#8217;erflows,<BR>
Than in mid winter the tempestrous main<BR>
Flings down his shield, and with both hands outright<BR>
Lays at Rogero&#8217;s helm with all his might.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
With that excessive force, wherewith the gin,<BR>
Erected in two barges upon Po,<BR>
And raised by men and wheels, with deafening din<BR>
Descends upon the sharpened piles below,<BR>
With all his might he smote the paladin<BR>
With either hand; was never direr blow:<BR>
Him the charmed helmet helped, or&#8212;such its force&#8212;<BR>
The stroke would have divided man and horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
As if about to fall, the youthful lord<BR>
Twice nodded, opening legs and arms; anew<BR>
Rodomont smote, in that he would afford<BR>
His foe no time his spirits to renew:<BR>
Then threatened other stroke; but that fine sword<BR>
Bore not such hammering, and in shivers flew;<BR>
And the bold Saracen, bereft of brand<BR>
Was in the combat left with unarmed hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
But not for this doth Rodomont refrain:<BR>
He swoops upon the Child, unheeding aught:<BR>
So sore astounded is Rogero&#8217;s brain;<BR>
So wholly overclouded is his thought.<BR>
But him the paynim well awakes again,<BR>
Whom by the neck he with strong arm has caught,<BR>
And gripes and grapples with such mighty force,<BR>
He falls on earth, pulled headlong from his horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
Yet leaps from earth as nimbly, moved by spleen<BR>
Far less than shame; for on his gentle bride<BR>
He turned his eyes, and that fair face serene<BR>
Now troubled the disdainful warrior spied.<BR>
She in sore doubt her champion&#8217;s fall had seen;<BR>
And well nigh at that sight the lady died.<BR>
Rogero, quickly to revenge the affront,<BR>
Clutches his sword and faces Rodomont.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
He at Rogero rode, who that rude shock<BR>
Shunned warily, retiring from his ground,<BR>
And, as he past, the paynim&#8217;s bridle took<BR>
With his left had, and turned his courser round;<BR>
While with his right he at his rider struck,<BR>
Whom he in belly, flank and breast would wound;<BR>
And twice sore anguish felt the monarch, gored<BR>
In flank and thigh, by good Rogero&#8217;s sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
Rodomont, grasping still in that close fight<BR>
The hilt and pommel of his broken blade,<BR>
Layed at Rogero&#8217;s helmet with such might,<BR>
That him another stroke might have dismaid:<BR>
But good Rogero, who should win of right,<BR>
Seizing his arm, the king so rudely swayed,<BR>
Bringing his left his better hand to speed,<BR>
That he pulled down the paynim from his steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Through force or skill, so fell the Moorish lord,<BR>
He stood his match, I rather ought to say<BR>
Fell on his feet; because Rogero&#8217;s sword<BR>
Gave him, &#8217;twas deemed, advantage in the fray.<BR>
Rogero stands aloof, with wary ward<BR>
As fain to keep the paynim king at bay.<BR>
For the wise champion will not let a wight<BR>
So talk and bulky close with him in fight;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
Rogero flank and thigh dyed red beheld,<BR>
And other wounds; and hoped he would have failed<BR>
By little and by little, as it welled;<BR>
So that he finally should have prevailed.<BR>
His hilt and pommel in his fist yet held<BR>
The paynim, which with all his might he scaled<BR>
At young Rogero; whom he smote so sore,<BR>
The stripling never was so stunned before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
In the helmet-cheek and shoulder-bone below<BR>
The Child was smit, and left so sore astound,<BR>
He, tripping still and staggering to and fro,<BR>
Scarce kept himself from falling to the ground.<BR>
Rodomont fain would close upon his foe;<BR>
But his foot fails him, weakened by the wound,<BR>
Which pierced his thigh: he overtasked his might;<BR>
And on his kneepan fell the paynim knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
Rogero lost no time, and with fierce blows<BR>
Smote him in face and bosom with his brand;<BR>
Hammered, and held the Saracen so close,<BR>
To ground he bore that champion with his hand.<BR>
But he so stirred himself, again he rose:<BR>
He gripes Rogero so, fast locked they stand.<BR>
Seconding their huge vigour by address,<BR>
They circle one another, shake, and press.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
His wounded thigh and gaping flank had sore<BR>
Weakened the vigour of the Moorish king:<BR>
Rogero had address; had mickle lore;<BR>
Was greatly practised in the wrestlers&#8217; ring:<BR>
He marked his vantage, nor from strife forbore;<BR>
And, where he saw the blood most freely spring,<BR>
And where most wounded was the warrior, prest<BR>
The paynim with his feet, his arms, and breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Rodomont filled with spite and rage, his foe<BR>
Takes by the neck and shoulders, and now bends<BR>
Towards him, and now pushes from him; now<BR>
Raises from earth, and on his chest suspends;<BR>
Whirls here and there and grapples; and to throw<BR>
The stripling sorely in that strife contends.<BR>
Collected in himself, Rogero wrought,<BR>
To keep his vantage taxing strength and thought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
So shifting oft his hold, about the Moor<BR>
His arms the good and bold Rogero wound;<BR>
Against his left flank shoved his breast, and sore<BR>
Strained him with all his strength engirdled round.<BR>
At once he past his better leg before<BR>
Rodomont&#8217;s knees and pushed, and from the ground<BR>
Uplifted high in air the Moorish lord;<BR>
Then hurled him down head foremost on the sward.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXV.</TD><TD>
Such was the shock wherewith King Rodomont<BR>
With battered head and spine the champion smote,<BR>
That, issuing from his wounds as from a font,<BR>
Streams of red blood the crimsoned herbage float.<BR>
Rogero, holding Fortune by the front,<BR>
Lest he should rise, with one hand griped his throat,<BR>
With one a dagger at his eyes addrest;<BR>
And with his knees the paynim&#8217;s belly prest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
As sometimes where they work the golden vein<BR>
Within Pannonian or Iberian cave,<BR>
In unexpected ruin whelm the train<BR>
By impious avarice there condemned to slave,<BR>
So with the load they lie opprest, with pain<BR>
A passage can their prisoned spirit have:<BR>
No less opprest the doughty paynim lay,<BR>
Pinned to the ground in that disastrous fray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Rogero at his vizor doth present<BR>
His naked poniard&#8217;s point, with threatening cry,<BR>
That he will slay him, save he yields, content<BR>
To let him live, if he for grace apply.<BR>
But Rodomont, who rather than be shent<BR>
For the least deed of shame, preferred to die,<BR>
Writhed, struggled, and with all his vigour tried<BR>
To pull Rogero down, and nought replied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
As mastiff that below the deer-hound lies,<BR>
Fixed by the gullet fast, with holding bite,<BR>
Sorely bestirs himself and vainly tries,<BR>
With lips besmeared with foam and eyes alight,<BR>
And cannot from beneath the conqueror rise,<BR>
Who foils his foe by force, and not despite;<BR>
So vainly strives the monarch of Argier<BR>
To rise from underneath the cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Yet Rodomont so twists and strives, he gains<BR>
The freedom of his better arm anew;<BR>
And with the right hand, which his poniard strains,<BR>
For he had drawn his deadly dagger too,<BR>
Would wound Rogero underneath the reins:<BR>
But now the wary youth the error knew<BR>
Through which he might have died, by his delay<BR>
That impious Saracen forthwith to slay;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXL.</TD><TD>
And smiting twice or thrice his horrid front,<BR>
Raising as high as he could raise in air<BR>
His dagger, buried it in Rodomont;<BR>
And freed himself withal from further care.<BR>
Loosed from the more than icy corse, to font<BR>
Of fetid Acheron, and hell&#8217;s foul repair,<BR>
The indignant spirit fled, blaspheming loud;<BR>
Erewhile on earth so haughty and so proud.</TD></TR>
