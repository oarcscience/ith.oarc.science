<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
A hermit parts, by means of hollow sprite,<BR>
The two redoubted rivals&#8217; dangerous play;<BR>
Rinaldo goes where Love and Hope invite,<BR>
But is dispatched by Charles another way:<BR>
Bradamont, seeking her devoted knight,<BR>
The good Rogero, nigh becomes the prey<BR>
Of Pinabel, who drops the damsel brave<BR>
Into the dungeon of a living grave.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
I<SMALL>NJURIOUS</SMALL> L<SMALL>OVE</SMALL>, why still to mar accord<BR>
Between desires has been thy favourite feat?<BR>
Why does it please thee so, perfidious lord,<BR>
Two hearts should with a different measure beat?<BR>
Thou wilt not let me take the certain ford,<BR>
Dragging me where the stream is deep and fleet.<BR>
Her I abandon who my love desires,<BR>
While she who hates, respect and love inspires.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Thou to Rinaldo show&#8217;st the damsel fair,<BR>
While he seems hideous to that gentle dame;<BR>
And he, who when the lady&#8217;s pride and care,<BR>
Paid back with deepest hate her amorous flame,<BR>
Now pines, himself, the victim of despair,<BR>
Scorned in his turn, and his reward the same.<BR>
By the changed damsel in such sort abhorred,<BR>
She would choose death before that hated lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
He to the Pagan cries: &#8220;Forego thy theft,<BR>
And down, false felon, from that pilfer&#8217;d steed;<BR>
I am not wont to let my own be reft.<BR>
And he who seeks it dearly pays the deed.<BR>
More&#8212;I shall take from thee yon lovely weft;<BR>
To leave thee such a prize were foul misdeed;<BR>
And horse and maid, whose worth outstrips belief,<BR>
Were ill, methinks, relinquished to a thief.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Thou liest,&#8221; the haughty Saracen retorts,<BR>
As proud, and burning with as fierce a flame,<BR>
&#8220;A thief thyself, if Fame the truth reports:<BR>
But let good deeds decide our dubious claim,<BR>
With whom the steed or damsel fair assorts:<BR>
Best proved by valiant deeds: though, for the dame,<BR>
That nothing is so precious, I with thee<BR>
(Search the wide world throughout) may well agree.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
As two fierce dogs will sometimes stand at gaze,<BR>
Whom hate or other springs of strife inspire,<BR>
And grind their teeth, while each his foe surveys<BR>
With sidelong glance and eyes more red than fire,<BR>
Then either falls to bites, and hoarsely bays,<BR>
While their stiff bristles stand on end with ire:<BR>
So from reproach and menace to the sword<BR>
Pass Sacripant and Clermont&#8217;s angry lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Thus kindling into wrath the knights engage:<BR>
One is on foot, the other on his horse:<BR>
Small gain to this; for inexperienced page<BR>
Would better rein his charger in the course.<BR>
For such Bayardo&#8217;s sense, he will not wage<BR>
War with his master, or put out his force.<BR>
For voice, nor hand, nor manage, will he stir,<BR>
Rebellious to the rein or goading spur.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
He, when the king would urge him, takes the rest,<BR>
Or, when he curbs him, runs in giddy rings;<BR>
And drops his head beneath his spreading chest,<BR>
And plays his spine, and runs an-end and flings.<BR>
And now the furious Saracen distressed,<BR>
Sees &#8217;tis no time to tame the beast, and springs,<BR>
With one hand on the pummel, to the ground;<BR>
Clear of the restless courser at a bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
As soon as Sacripant, with well-timed leap,<BR>
Is from the fury of Bayardo freed,<BR>
You may believe the battle does not sleep<BR>
Between those champions, matched in heart and deed.<BR>
Their sounding blades such changeful measure keep,<BR>
The hammer-strokes of Vulcan with less speed<BR>
Descend in that dim cavern, where he heats,<BR>
And Jove&#8217;s red thunders on his anvil beats.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Sometimes they lunge, then feign the thrust and parry:<BR>
Deep masters of the desperate game they play;<BR>
Or rise upon the furious stroke, and carry<BR>
Their swords aloft, or stoop and stand at bay.<BR>
Again they close, again exhausted tarry;<BR>
Now hide, now show themselves, and now give way,<BR>
And where one knight an inch of ground has granted,<BR>
His foeman&#8217;s foot upon that inch is planted.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
When, lo! Rinaldo, now impatient grown,<BR>
Strikes full at Sacripant with lifted blade;<BR>
And he puts forth his buckler made of bone,<BR>
And well with strong and stubborn steel inlaid:<BR>
Though passing thick, Fusberta cleaves it: groan<BR>
Greenwood, and covert close, and sunny glade.<BR>
The paynim&#8217;s arm rings senseless with the blow,<BR>
And steel and bone, like ice, in shivers go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
When the fair damsel saw, with timid eye,<BR>
Such ruin follow from the faulchion&#8217;s sway,<BR>
She, like the criminal, whose doom is nigh,<BR>
Changed her fair countenance through sore dismay,<BR>
And deemed that little time was left to fly<BR>
If she would not be that Rinaldo&#8217;s prey,<BR>
Rinaldo loathed by her as much, as he<BR>
Doats on the scornful damsel miserably.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
So turned her horse into the gloomy chase,<BR>
And drove him through rough path and tangled ally,<BR>
And oftentimes bent back her bloodless face,<BR>
And saw Rinaldo from each thicket sally.<BR>
Nor flying long had urged the frantic race,<BR>
Before she met a hermit in a valley.<BR>
Devotion in his aspect was expressed,<BR>
And his long beard descended on his breast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
Wasted he was as much by fasts as age,<BR>
And on an ass was mounted, slow and sure;<BR>
His visage warranted that never sage<BR>
Had conscience more precise or passing pure.<BR>
Though in his arteries time had stilled the rage<BR>
Of blood, and spake him feeble and demure,<BR>
At sight of the delighted damsel, he<BR>
Was inly stirred for very charity.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
The lady prayed that kindly friar, that he<BR>
Would straight conduct her to some haven near,<BR>
For that she from the land of France might flee,<BR>
And never more of loathed Rinaldo hear.<BR>
The hermit, who was skilled in sorcery,<BR>
Ceased not to soothe the gentle damsel&#8217;s fear.<BR>
And with the promise of deliverance, shook<BR>
His pocket, and drew forth a secret book.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
This opened, quick and mighty marvel wrought;<BR>
For not a leaf is finished by the sage,<BR>
Before a spirit, by his bidding brought,<BR>
Waits his command in likeness of a page:<BR>
He, by the magic writ constrained and taught,<BR>
Hastes where the warriors face to face engage,<BR>
In the cool shade&#8212;but not in cool disport&#8212;<BR>
And steps between, and stops their battle short.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;In courtesy,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;let either show<BR>
What his foe&#8217;s death to either can avail,<BR>
And what the guerdon conquest will bestow<BR>
On him who in the battle shall prevail,<BR>
If Roland, though he has not struck a blow,<BR>
Or snapt in fight a single link of mail,<BR>
To Paris-town conveys the damsel gay,<BR>
Who has engaged you in this bitter fray.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Within an easy mile I saw the peer<BR>
Pricking to Paris with that lady bright;<BR>
Riding, in merry mood, with laugh and jeer,<BR>
And mocking at your fierce and fruitless fight.<BR>
Sure it were better, while they yet are near,<BR>
To follow peer and damsel in their flight:<BR>
For should he once in Paris place his prize<BR>
The lady never more shall meet your eyes.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
You might have seen those angry cavaliers<BR>
Change at the demon&#8217;s tale for rage and shame;<BR>
And curse themselves as wanting eyes and ears,<BR>
To let their rival cheat them of the dame.<BR>
Towards his horse the good Rinaldo steers,<BR>
Breathing forth piteous sighs which seem of flame;<BR>
And, if he joins Orlando&#8212;ere they part&#8212;<BR>
Swears in his fury he will have his heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
So, passing where the prompt Bayardo stood,<BR>
Leaps on his back, and leaves, as swift as wind,<BR>
Without farewell, his rival in the wood;<BR>
Much less invites him to a seat behind.<BR>
The goaded charger, in his heat of blood,<BR>
Forces whate&#8217;er his eager course confined,<BR>
Ditch, river, tangled thorn, or marble block;<BR>
He swims the river, and he clears the rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
Let it not, sir, sound strangely in your ear<BR>
Rinaldo took the steed thus readily,<BR>
So long and vainly followed far and near;<BR>
For he, endued with reasoning faculty,<BR>
Had not in vice lured on the following peer,<BR>
But fled before his cherished lord, that he<BR>
Might guide him whither went the gentle dame,<BR>
For whom, as he had heard, he nursed a flame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
For when Angelica, in random dread,<BR>
From the pavilion winged her rapid flight,<BR>
Bayardo marked the damsel as she fled,<BR>
His saddle lightened of Mount Alban&#8217;s knight;<BR>
Who then on foot an equal combat sped,<BR>
Matched with a baron of no meaner might;<BR>
And chased the maid by woods, and floods, and strands,<BR>
In hopes to place her in the warrior&#8217;s hands.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
And, with desire to bring him to the maid,<BR>
Gallopped before him still with rampant play;<BR>
But would not let his master mount, afraid<BR>
That he might make him take another way.<BR>
So luring on Rinaldo through the shade,<BR>
Twice brought him to his unexpected prey;<BR>
Twice foiled in his endeavour: once by bold<BR>
Ferrau; then Sacripant, as lately told.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
Now good Bayardo had believed the tiding<BR>
Of that fair damsel, which produced the accord;<BR>
And in the devil&#8217;s cunning tale confiding,<BR>
Renewed his wonted service to his lord.<BR>
Behold Rinaldo then in fury riding,<BR>
And pushing still his courser Paris-ward!<BR>
Though he fly fast, the champion&#8217;s wishes go<BR>
Faster; and wind itself had seemed too slow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
At night Rinaldo rests his steed, with pain<BR>
To meet Anglante&#8217;s lord he burned so sore;<BR>
And lent such credit to the tidings vain<BR>
Of the false courier of that wizard hoar:<BR>
And that day and the next, with flowing rein,<BR>
Rode, till the royal city rose before<BR>
His eyes; where Charlemagne had taken post,<BR>
With the sad remnant of his broken host.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
He, for he fears the Afric king&#8217;s pursuit,<BR>
And sap and siege, upon his vassals calls<BR>
To gather in fresh victual, and recruit<BR>
And cleanse their ditches, and repair their walls.<BR>
And what may best annoy the foes, and suit<BR>
For safety, without more delay forestalls;<BR>
And plans an embassy to England, thence<BR>
To gather fresher forces for defence.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
For he is bent again to try the fate<BR>
Of arms in tented field, though lately shamed;<BR>
And send Rinaldo to the neighbouring state<BR>
Of Britain, which was after England named.<BR>
Ill liked the Paladin to cross the strait;<BR>
Not that the people or the land he blamed,<BR>
But that King Charles was sudden; nor a day<BR>
Would grant the valiant envoy for delay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo never executed thing<BR>
Less willingly, prevented in his quest<BR>
Of that fair visage he was following,<BR>
Whose charms his heart had ravished from his breast.<BR>
Yet, in obediance to the christian king,<BR>
Prepared himself to do the royal hest.<BR>
To Calais the good envoy wends with speed,<BR>
And the same day embarks himself and steed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
And there, in scorn of cautious pilot&#8217;s skill<BR>
(Such his impatience to regain his home),<BR>
Launched on the doubtful sea, which boded ill,<BR>
And rolled its heavy billows, white with foam.<BR>
The wind, enraged that he opposed his will,<BR>
Stirred up the waves; and, &#8217;mid the gathering gloom,<BR>
So the loud storm and tempest&#8217;s fury grew,<BR>
That topmast-high the flashing waters flew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
The watchful mariners, in wary sort,<BR>
Haul down the mainsail, and attempt to wear;<BR>
And would put back in panic to the port,<BR>
Whence, in ill hour, they loosed with little care.<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Not so,&#8221; exclaims the wind, and stops them short,<BR>
&#8220;So poor a penance will not pay the dare.&#8221;<BR>
And when they fain would veer, with fiercer roar<BR>
Pelts back their reeling prow and blusters more.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Starboard and larboard bears the fitful gale,<BR>
And never for a thought its ire assuages;<BR>
While the strained vessel drives with humble sail<BR>
Before the billows, as the tempest rages.<BR>
But I, who still pursue a varying tale,<BR>
Must leave awhile the Paladin, who wages<BR>
A weary warfare with the wind and flood;<BR>
To follow a fair virgin of his blood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
I speak of that famed damsel, by whose spear<BR>
O&#8217;erthrown, King Sacripant on earth was flung;<BR>
The worthy sister of the valiant peer,<BR>
From Beatrix and good Duke Aymon sprung.<BR>
By daring deeds and puissance no less dear<BR>
To Charlemagne and France: Since proved among<BR>
The first, her prowess, tried by many a test,<BR>
Equal to good Rinaldo&#8217;s shone confessed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
A cavalier was suitor to the dame,<BR>
Who out of Afric passed with Agramant;<BR>
Rogero was his valiant father&#8217;s name,<BR>
His mother was the child of Agolant.<BR>
And she, who not of bear or lion came,<BR>
Disdained not on the Child her love to plant,<BR>
Though cruel Fortune, ill their wishes meeting,<BR>
Had granted to the pair a single greeting.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
Alone thenceforth she sought her lover (he<BR>
Was named of him to whom he owed his birth),<BR>
And roved as safe as if in company<BR>
Of thousands, trusting in her single worth.<BR>
She having made the king of Circassy<BR>
Salute the visage of old mother earth,<BR>
Traversed a wood, and that wood past, a mountain;<BR>
And stopt at length beside a lovely fountain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Through a delicious mead the fountain-rill,<BR>
By ancient trees o&#8217;ershaded, glides away;<BR>
And him whose ear its pleasing murmurs fill,<BR>
Invites to drink, and on its banks to stay;<BR>
On the left side a cultivated hill<BR>
Excludes the fervors of the middle day.<BR>
As first the damsel thither turns her eyes,<BR>
A youthful cavalier she seated spies;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
A cavalier, who underneath the shade,<BR>
Seems lost, as in a melancholy dream;<BR>
And on the bank, which gaudy flowers displayed,<BR>
Reposing, overhangs the crystal stream.<BR>
His horse beneath a spreading beech is laid,<BR>
And from a bough the shield and helmet gleam.<BR>
While his moist eyes, and sad and downcast air,<BR>
Speak him the broken victim of despair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
Urged by the passion lodged in every breast,<BR>
A restless curiosity to know<BR>
Of others&#8217; cares, the gentle maid addressed<BR>
The knight, and sought the occasion of his woe.<BR>
And he to her his secret grief confessed,<BR>
Won by her gentle speech and courteous show,<BR>
And by that gallant bearing, which at sight,<BR>
Prepared who saw her for nimble knight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Fair sir, a band of horse and foot,&#8221; he said,<BR>
&#8220;I brought to Charlemagne; and thither pressed,<BR>
Where he an ambush for Marsilius spread,<BR>
Descending from the Pyrenean crest;<BR>
And in my company a damsel led,<BR>
Whose charms with fervid love had fired my breast.<BR>
When, as we journey by Rhone&#8217;s current, I<BR>
A rider on a winged courser spy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The robber, whether he were man or shade,<BR>
Or goblin damned to everlasting woe,<BR>
As soon as he beheld my dear-loved maid,<BR>
Like falcon, who, descending, aims its blow,<BR>
Sank in a thought and rose; and soaring, laid<BR>
Hands on his prize, and snatched her from below.<BR>
So quick the rape, that all appeared a dream,<BR>
Until I heard in air the damsel&#8217;s scream.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The ravening kite so swoops and plunders, when<BR>
Hovering above the shelterd yard, she spies<BR>
A helpless chicken near unwatchful hen,<BR>
Who vainly dins the thief with after cries.<BR>
I cannot reach the mountain-robber&#8217;s den,<BR>
Compassed with cliffs, or follow one who flies.<BR>
Besides, way-foundered is my weary steed,<BR>
Who &#8217;mid these rocks has wasted wind and speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But I, like one who from his bleeding side<BR>
Would liefer far have seen his heart out-torn,<BR>
Left my good squadrons masterless, to ride<BR>
Along the cliffs, and passes least forlorn;<BR>
And took the way (love served me for a guide)<BR>
Where it appeared the ruthless thief had born,<BR>
Ascending to his den, the lovely prey,<BR>
What time he snatched my hope and peace away.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Six days I rode, from morn to setting sun,<BR>
By horrid cliff, by bottom dark and drear;<BR>
And giddy precipice, where path was none,<BR>
Nor sign, nor vestiges of man were near.<BR>
At last a dark and barren vale I won,<BR>
Where caverned mountains and rude cliffs appear;<BR>
Where in the middle rose a rugged block,<BR>
With a fair castle planted on the rock.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;From far it shone like flame, and seemed not dight<BR>
Of marble or of brick; and in my eye<BR>
More wonderful the work, more fair to sight<BR>
The walls appeared, as I approached more nigh.<BR>
I, after, learned that it was built by sprite<BR>
Whom potent fumes had raised and sorcery:<BR>
Who on this rock its towers of steel did fix,<BR>
Case-hardened in the stream and fire of Styx.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Each polished turret shines with such a ray<BR>
That it defies the mouldering rust and rain:<BR>
The robber scours the country night and day,<BR>
And after harbours in this sure domain.<BR>
Nothing is safe which he would bear away;<BR>
Pursued with curses and with threats in vain.<BR>
There (fruitless every hope to foil his art)<BR>
The felon keeps my love, oh! say my heart.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Alas! what more is left me but to eye<BR>
Her prison on that cliff&#8217;s a&euml;rial crest?<BR>
Like the she-fox, who hears her offspring cry,<BR>
Standing beneath the ravening eagle&#8217;s nest;<BR>
And since she has not wings to rise and fly,<BR>
Runs round the rugged rock with hopeless quest.<BR>
So inaccessible the wild dominion<BR>
To whatsoever has not plume and pinion.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;While I so lingered where those rocks aspire,<BR>
I saw a dwarf guide two of goodly strain;<BR>
Whose coming added hope to my desire<BR>
(Alas! desire and hope alike were vain)<BR>
Both barons bold, and fearful in their ire:<BR>
The one Gradasso, King of Sericane,<BR>
The next, of youthful vigour, was a knight,<BR>
Prized in the Moorish court, Rogero hight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The dwarf exclaimed, &#8216;These champions will assay<BR>
Their force with him who dwells on yonder steep,<BR>
And by such strange and unattempted way<BR>
Spurs the winged courser from his mountain-keep.&#8217;<BR>
And I to the approaching warriors say,<BR>
&#8216;Pity, fair sirs, the cruel loss I weep,<BR>
And, as I trust, yon daring spoiler slain,<BR>
Give my lost lady to my arms again.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then how my love was ravished I make known,<BR>
Vouching with bitter tears my deep distress.<BR>
They proffer aid, and down the path of stone<BR>
Which winds about the craggy mountain, press.<BR>
While I, upon the summit left alone,<BR>
Look on, and pray to God for their success.<BR>
Beneath the wily wizard&#8217;s castle strong<BR>
Extends a little plain, two bow-shots long.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Arrived beneath the craggy keep, the two<BR>
Contend which warrior shall begin the fight.<BR>
When, whether the first lot Gradasso drew,<BR>
Or young Rogero held the honor light,<BR>
The King of Sericane his bugle blew,<BR>
And the rock rang and fortress on the height;<BR>
And, lo! apparelled for the fearful course,<BR>
The cavalier upon his winged horse!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Upwards, by little and by little, springs<BR>
The winged courser, as the pilgrim crane<BR>
Finds not at first his balance and his wings,<BR>
Running and scarcely rising from the plain;<BR>
But when the flock is launched and scattered, flings<BR>
His pinions to the wind, and soars amain.<BR>
So straight the necromancer&#8217;s upward flight,<BR>
The eagle scarce attempts so bold a height.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When it seems fit, he wheels his courser round,<BR>
Who shuts his wings, and falling from the sky,<BR>
Shoots like a well trained falcon to the ground,<BR>
Who sees the quarry, duck or pigeon, fly:<BR>
So, through the parting air, with whizzing sound,<BR>
With rested lance, he darted from on high;<BR>
And while Gradasso scarcely marks the foe<BR>
He hears him swooping near, and feels the blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The wizard on Gradasso breaks his spear,<BR>
He wounds the empty air, with fury vain.<BR>
This in the feathered monster breeds no fear;<BR>
Who to a distance shifts, and swoops again.<BR>
While that encounter made the Alfana rear,<BR>
Thrown back upon her haunches, on the plain.<BR>
The Alfana that the Indian monarch rode,<BR>
The fairest was that ever man bestrode.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Up to the starry sphere with swift ascent<BR>
The wizard soars, then pounces from the sky,<BR>
And strikes the young Rogero, who, intent<BR>
Upon Gradasso, deems no danger nigh.<BR>
Beneath the wizard&#8217;s blow the warrior bent,<BR>
Which made some deal his generous courser ply;<BR>
And when to smite the shifting foe he turned,<BR>
Him in the sky, and out of reach discerned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His blows Rogero, now Gradasso, bruise<BR>
On forehead, bosom, back, or flanks, between;<BR>
While he the warrior&#8217;s empty blows eschews,<BR>
Shifting so quickly that he scarce is seen.<BR>
Now this, now that, the wizard seems to choose,<BR>
The monster makes such spacious rings and clean,<BR>
While the enchanter so deceives the knights,<BR>
They view him not, and know not whence he smites.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Between the two on earth and him o&#8217; the sky,<BR>
Until that hour the warfare lasted there,<BR>
Which, spreading wide its veil of dusky dye,<BR>
Throughout the world, discolours all things fair.<BR>
What I beheld, I say; I add not, I,<BR>
A tittle to the tale; yet scarcely dare<BR>
To tell to other what I stood and saw;<BR>
So strange it seems, so passing Nature&#8217;s law.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Well covered in a goodly silken case,<BR>
He, the celestial warrior, bore his shield;<BR>
But why delayed the mantle to displace<BR>
I know not, and its lucid orb concealed.<BR>
Since this no sooner blazes in his face,<BR>
Than his foe tumbles dazzled on the field;<BR>
And while he, like a lifeless body, lies,<BR>
Becomes the necromancer&#8217;s helpless prize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Like carbuncle, the magic buckler blazed,<BR>
No glare was ever seen which shone so bright:<BR>
Nor could the warriors choose but fall, amazed<BR>
And blinded by the clear and dazzling light.<BR>
I, too, that from a distant mountain gazed,<BR>
Fell senseless; and when I regained my sight,<BR>
After long time, saw neither knights nor page,<BR>
Nor aught beside a dark and empty stage.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This while the fell enchanter, I supposed,<BR>
Dragged both the warriors to his prison-cell;<BR>
And by strange virtue of the shield disclosed,<BR>
I from my hope and they from freedom fell:<BR>
And thus I to the turrets, which enclosed<BR>
My heart, departing, bade a last farewell.<BR>
Now sum my griefs, and say if love combine<BR>
Other distress or grief to match with mine.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
The knight relapsed into his first disease,<BR>
After his melancholy tale was done.<BR>
This was Count Pinabel, the Maganzese,<BR>
Anselmo d&#8217; Altaripa&#8217;s faithless son.<BR>
He, where the blood ran foul through all degrees,<BR>
Disdained to be the only virtuous one;<BR>
Nor played a simple part among the base,<BR>
Passing in vice the villains of his race.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
With aspect changing still, the beauteous dame<BR>
Hears what the mournful Maganzese narrates;<BR>
And, at first mention of Rogero&#8217;s name,<BR>
Her radiant face with eager joy dilates.<BR>
But, full of pity, kindles into flame<BR>
As Pinabel his cruel durance states.<BR>
Nor finds she, though twice told, the story stale;<BR>
But makes him oft repeat and piece his tale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
And, after, when she deemed that all was clear,<BR>
Cried to the knight, &#8220;Repose upon my say.<BR>
To thee may my arrival well be dear,<BR>
And thou as fortunate account this day.<BR>
Straight wend me to the keep, sir cavalier,<BR>
Which holds a jewel of so rich a ray:<BR>
Nor shalt thou grudge thy labour and thy care,<BR>
If envious Fortune do but play me fair.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
The knight replied, &#8220;Then nought to me remains<BR>
But that I yonder mountain-passes show;<BR>
And sure &#8217;tis little loss to lose my pains,<BR>
Where every thing is lost I prize below.<BR>
But you would climb yon cliffs, and for your gains<BR>
Will find a prison-house, and be it so!<BR>
Whate&#8217;er betide you, blame yourself alone;<BR>
You go forewarned to meet a fate foreshown.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
So said, the cavalier remounts his horse,<BR>
And serves the gallant damsel as a guide;<BR>
Who is prepared Rogero&#8217;s gaol to force,<BR>
Or to be slain, or in his prison stied.<BR>
When lo! a messenger, in furious course,<BR>
Called to the dame to stay, and rode and cried.<BR>
This was the post who told Circassa&#8217;s lord<BR>
What valiant hand had stretched him on the sward.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
The courier, who so plied his restless heel,<BR>
News of Narbonne and of Montpelier bore:<BR>
How both had raised the standard of Castile,<BR>
All Acquamorta siding with the Moor;<BR>
And how Marseilles&#8217; disheartened men appeal<BR>
To her, who should protect her straightened shore;<BR>
And how, through him, her citizens demand<BR>
Counsel and comfort at their captain&#8217;s hand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
This goodly town, with many miles of plain,<BR>
Which lie &#8217;twixt Var and Rhone, upon the sea,<BR>
To her was given by royal Charlemagne:<BR>
Such trust he placed in her fidelity.<BR>
Still wont with wonder on the tented plain<BR>
The prowess of that valiant maid to see.<BR>
And now the panting courier, as I said,<BR>
Rode from Marseilles to ask the lady&#8217;s aid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Whether or not she should the call obey,<BR>
The youthful damsel doubts some little space;<BR>
Strong in one balance Fame and Duty weigh,<BR>
But softer thoughts both Fame and Duty chase:<BR>
And she, at length, resolved the emprize to assay,<BR>
And free Rogero from the enchanted place:<BR>
Or, should her valour in the adventure fail,<BR>
Would with the cherished lover share his jail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
And did with such excuse that post appay,<BR>
He was contented on her will to wait:<BR>
Then turned the bridle to resume her way<BR>
With Pinabel, who seemed no whit elate.<BR>
Since of that line he knows the damsel gay,<BR>
Held in such open and such secret hate;<BR>
And future trouble to himself foresees,<BR>
Were he detected as a Maganzese.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
For &#8217;twixt Maganza&#8217;s and old Clermont&#8217;s line<BR>
There was an ancient and a deadly feud:<BR>
And oft to blows the rival houses came,<BR>
And oft in civil blood their hands embrued.<BR>
And hence some treason to this gentle dame<BR>
In his foul heart, the wicked County brewed;<BR>
Or, as the first occasion served, would stray<BR>
Out of the road, and leave her by the way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
And so the traitor&#8217;s troubled fancy rack<BR>
Fear, doubt, and his own native, rancorous mood,<BR>
That unawares he issued from the track,<BR>
And found himself within a gloomy wood:<BR>
Where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back,<BR>
Whose stony peak above the forest stood;<BR>
The daughter of Dodona&#8217;s duke behind,<BR>
Dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
He, when he saw himself within the brake,<BR>
Thought to abandon his unweeting foe;<BR>
And to the dame&#8212;&#8220;&#8201;&#8217;Twere better that we make<BR>
For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;<BR>
And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)<BR>
A tower is seated in the vale below.<BR>
Do you expect me then, while from the peak<BR>
I measure the remembered place I seek.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
So said, he pushed his courser up the height<BR>
Of that lone mountain; in his evil mind<BR>
Revolving, as he went, some scheme or sleight<BR>
To rid him of the gentle dame behind.<BR>
When lo! a rocky cavern met his sight,<BR>
Amid those precipices dark and blind:<BR>
Its sides descended thirty yards and more,<BR>
Worked smooth, and at the bottom was a door.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
A void was at the bottom, where a wide<BR>
Portal conducted to an inner room:<BR>
From thence a light shone out on every side,<BR>
As of a torch illumining the gloom.<BR>
Fair Bradamant pursued her faithless guide,<BR>
Suspended there, and pondering on her doom:<BR>
And came upon the felon where he stood,<BR>
Fearing lest she might lose him in the wood.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
When her approach the County&#8217;s first intent<BR>
Made vain, the wily traitor sought to mend<BR>
His toils, and some new stratagem invent<BR>
To rid her thence, or bring her to her end.<BR>
And so to meet the approaching lady went,<BR>
And showed the cave, and prayed her to ascend;<BR>
And said that in its bottom he had seen<BR>
A gentle damsel of bewitching mien.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Who, by her lovely semblance and rich vest,<BR>
Appeared a lady of no mean degree;<BR>
But melancholy, weeping, and distressed,<BR>
As one who pined there in captivity;<BR>
And that when he towards the entrance pressed,<BR>
To learn who that unhappy maid might be,<BR>
One on the melancholy damsel flew,<BR>
And her within that inner cavern drew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
The beauteous Bradamant, who was more bold<BR>
Than wary, gave a ready ear; and, bent<BR>
To help the maid, imprisoned in that hold,<BR>
Sought but the means to try the deep descent.<BR>
Then, looking round, descried an elm-tree old,<BR>
Which furnished present means for her intent;<BR>
And from the tree, with boughs and foliage stored,<BR>
Lopt a long branch, and shaped it with her sword.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
The severed end she to the count commended,<BR>
Then, grasping it, hung down that entrance steep.<BR>
With her feet foremost, by her arms suspended:<BR>
When asking if she had the skill to leap,<BR>
The traitor, with a laugh, his hands extended.<BR>
And plunged his helpless prey into the deep.<BR>
&#8220;And thus,&#8221; exclaimed the ruffian, &#8220;might I speed<BR>
With thee each sucker of thy cursed seed!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
But not, as was the will of Pinabel,<BR>
Such cruel lot fair Bradamant assayed;<BR>
For striking on the bottom of the cell,<BR>
The stout elm-bough so long her weight upstayed,<BR>
That, though it split and splintered where it fell,<BR>
It broked her fall, and saved the gentle maid.<BR>
Some while astounded there the lady lay,<BR>
As the ensuing canto will display.</TD></TR>
