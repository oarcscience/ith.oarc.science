<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
To whatsoever evil tongue can tell<BR>
Of womankind King Rodomont gives ear;<BR>
Then journeys homeward; but that infidel<BR>
Finds by the way a place he holds more dear.<BR>
Here him new love inflames for Isabel;<BR>
But so the wishes of the cavalier<BR>
A friar impedes, who with that damsel wends,<BR>
Him by a cruel death the felon ends.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
Ladies, and all of you that ladies prize,<BR>
Afford not, for the love of heaven, an ear<BR>
To this, the landlord&#8217;s tale, replete with lies,<BR>
In shame and scorn of womankind; though ne&#8217;er<BR>
Was praise or fame conveyed in that which flies<BR>
From such a caitiff&#8217;s tongue; and still we hear<BR>
The sottish rabble all things rashly brand,<BR>
And question most what least they understand.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Omit this canto, and&#8212;the tale untold&#8212;<BR>
My story will as clear and perfect be;<BR>
I tell it, since by Turpin it is told,<BR>
And not in malice or in rivalry:<BR>
Besides, that never did my tongue withhold<BR>
Your praises, how you are beloved by me<BR>
To you I by a thousand proofs have shown,<BR>
Vouching I am, and can but be, your own.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Let him who will, three leaves or four pass-by,<BR>
Nor read a line; or let him, who will read,<BR>
As little of that landlord&#8217;s history,<BR>
As of a tale or fiction, make his creed.<BR>
But to my story:&#8212;When his auditory<BR>
He saw were waiting for him to proceed,<BR>
And that a place was yielded him, o&#8217;eright<BR>
The cavalier, he &#8217;gan his tale recite:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Astolpho that the Lombard sceptre swayed,<BR>
Who was King Monacho, his brother&#8217;s heir,<BR>
By nature with such graces was purveyed,<BR>
Few e&#8217;er with him in beauty could compare:<BR>
Such scarce Apelles&#8217; pencil had pourtrayed,<BR>
Zeuxis&#8217;, or worthier yet, if worthier were:<BR>
Beauteous he was, and so by all was deemed,<BR>
But far more beauteous he himself esteemed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He not so much rejoiced that he in height<BR>
Of grandeur was exalted o&#8217;er the rest,<BR>
And that, for riches, subjects, and for might,<BR>
Of all the neighbouring kings he was the best,<BR>
As that, superior to each other wight,<BR>
He beauty was throughout the world confest.<BR>
This pleased the monarch, who the praise conferred,<BR>
As that wherein he most delighted, heard.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Faustus Latinus, one of his array,<BR>
Who pleased the king, a Roman cavalier,<BR>
Hearing ofttimes Astolpho now display<BR>
The beauties of his hand, now of his cheer,<BR>
And, questioned by that monarch, on a day,<BR>
If ever in his lifetime, far or near,<BR>
He any of such beauty had espied,<BR>
To him thus unexpectedly replied:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Faustus to him replied: &#8216;By what I see,<BR>
And what I hear, is said by every one,<BR>
Few are there that in beauty rival thee;<BR>
And rather I those few confine to one:<BR>
Jocundo is that one, my brother he;<BR>
And well I ween that, saving him alone,<BR>
Thou leavest all in beauty far behind;<BR>
But I in him thy peer and better find.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Impossible Astolpho deemed the thing,<BR>
Who hitherto had thought the palm his own;<BR>
And such a longing seized the Lombard king<BR>
To know that youth whose praises so were blown,<BR>
He prest, till Faustus promised him to bring<BR>
The brother praised by him, before his throne,<BR>
Though &#8217;twould be much if thither he repaired,<BR>
(The courier added) and the cause declared:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Because the youth had ne&#8217;er been known to measure,<BR>
In all his life, a single pace from Rome;<BR>
But, on what Fortune gave him, lived at leisure,<BR>
Contented in his own paternal dome;<BR>
Nor had diminished nor encreased the treasure,<BR>
Wherewith his father had endowed that home;<BR>
And he more distant would Paris deem<BR>
Than Tanais another would esteem;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And that a greater difficulty were<BR>
To tear Jocundo from his consort; who<BR>
Was by such love united to that fair,<BR>
No other will but hers the husband knew:<BR>
Yet at his sovereign&#8217;s hest he would repair<BR>
To seek the stripling, and his utmost do.<BR>
The suit with offers and with gifts was crowned,<BR>
Which for that youth&#8217;s refusal left no ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Faustus set forth, and, after few days&#8217; ride,<BR>
Reached Rome, and his paternal mansion gained:<BR>
There with entreaties so the brother plied,<BR>
He to that journey his consent obtained;<BR>
And wrought so well (though difficult to guide)<BR>
Silent even young Jocundo&#8217;s wife remained;<BR>
He showing her what good would thence ensue,<BR>
Besides what gratitude would be her due.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Jocundo names a time to wend his way,<BR>
And servingmen meanwhile purveys and steeds;<BR>
And a provision makes of fair array;<BR>
For beauty borrows grace from glorious weeds.<BR>
Beside him or about him, night and day,<BR>
Aye weeping, to her lord the lady reads;<BR>
She knows not how she ever can sustain<BR>
So long an absence, and not die with pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For the mere thought produced such misery,<BR>
It seemed from her was ravished her heart&#8217;s core.<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;Alas! my love (Jocundo cried) let be<BR>
Thy sorrows&#8217;&#8212;weeping with her evermore&#8212;<BR>
&#8216;So may this journey prosper! as to thee<BR>
Will I return ere yet two months are o&#8217;er;<BR>
Nor by a day o&#8217;erpass the term prescribed,<BR>
Though me the king with half his kingdom bribed.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;This brought his troubled consort small content:<BR>
She that the period was too distant said,<BR>
And that &#8217;twould be a mighty wonderment,<BR>
If her, at his return, he found not dead.<BR>
The grief which, day and night, her bosom rent,<BR>
Was such, that lady neither slept nor fed:<BR>
So that for pity oft the youth repented<BR>
He to his brother&#8217;s wishes had consented.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;She from her neck unloosed a costly chain<BR>
That a gemmed cross and holy reliques bore;<BR>
Which one, a pilgrim of Bohemia&#8217;s reign,<BR>
Had gathered upon many a distant shore;<BR>
Him did her sire in sickness entertain,<BR>
Returning from Jerusalem of yore;<BR>
And hence was made that dying pilgrim&#8217;s heir:<BR>
This she undoes, and gives her lord to wear;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And round his neck entreats him, for her sake,<BR>
That chain in memory of herself to wind:<BR>
Her gift the husband is well pleased to take;<BR>
Not that a token needs his love to bind:<BR>
For neither time, nor absence, e&#8217;er will shake,<BR>
Nor whatsoever fortune is behind,<BR>
Her memory, which, rooted fast and deep,<BR>
He still has kept, and after death will keep.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The night before that morning streaked the sky,<BR>
Fixt for his journey, to his sore dismay,<BR>
Her husband deemed that in his arms would die<BR>
The wife from whom he was to wend his way.<BR>
She slumbered not: to her a last goodbye<BR>
He bade, while yet it lacked an hour of day,<BR>
Mounted his nag, and on his journey sped;<BR>
While his afflicted spouse returned to bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Jocundo was not two miles on his road,<BR>
When he that jewelled cross recalled to mind;<BR>
Which he beneath his pillow had bestowed,<BR>
And, through forgetfulness, had left behind.<BR>
&#8216;Alas! (the youth bethought him) in what mode<BR>
Shall I excuse for my omission find,<BR>
So that from this my consort shall not deem<BR>
I little her unbounded love esteem?</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He pondered an excuse; then weened &#8217;twould be<BR>
Of little value, if it were exprest<BR>
By page or other&#8212;save his embassy<BR>
He did himself; his brother he addrest;<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;Now to Baccano ride you leisurely,<BR>
And there at the first inn set-up your rest;<BR>
For I must back to Rome without delay;<BR>
But trust to overtake you by the way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;No other but myself my need could do.<BR>
Doubt not but I shall speedily be back.&#8217;<BR>
&#8212;No servant took he, but, with an adieu,<BR>
Jocundo, at a trot, wheeled round his hack,<BR>
And when that cavalier the stream was through,<BR>
The rising sun &#8217;gan chase the dusky rack.<BR>
At home he lighted, sought his bed, and found<BR>
The consort he had quitted sleeping sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He, without saying aught, the curtains drew,<BR>
And, what he least believed, within espied;<BR>
For he beneath the quilt, his consort true<BR>
And chaste, saw sleeping at a stripling&#8217;s side.<BR>
Forthwith Jocundo that adulterer knew,<BR>
By practice, of his features certified,<BR>
In that he was a footboy in his train,<BR>
Nourished by him, and come of humble strain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To imagine his distress and wonderment,<BR>
And warrant it, that other may believe,<BR>
Is better than to make the experiment,<BR>
And, like this wretch, the cruel proof receive:<BR>
By anger stirred, it was his first intent<BR>
To draw his sword, and both of life bereave;<BR>
But love, which spite himself, he entertained<BR>
For that ungrateful woman, him restrained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You see if like a vassal he obeyed<BR>
This ribald Love, who left him not the force<BR>
To wake her, lest to know her guilt surveyed,<BR>
Should in his consort&#8217;s bosom move remorse.<BR>
As best he could, he forth in silence made,<BR>
The stair descended, and regained his horse.<BR>
Goaded by Love, he goads his steed again,<BR>
And ere they reach their inn rejoins his train.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His change of mien to all was manifest;<BR>
All saw his heart was heavy; yet not one,<BR>
Mid these, in any sort, the reason guessed,<BR>
Nor read the secret woe which caused his moan;<BR>
All thought he had to Rome his steps addrest,<BR>
Woe to the town, surnamed of horns, had gone.<BR>
That Love has caused the mischief all surmise,<BR>
Though none of them conjectures in what wise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His brother weened he was in grief immersed<BR>
For his deserted wife: he, on his side,<BR>
For other reason, inly chafed and cursed,<BR>
&#8212;That she was but too well accompanied.<BR>
Meanwhile, with swelling lips and forehead pursed,<BR>
The ground that melancholy stripling eyed.<BR>
Faustus, who vainly would apply relief,<BR>
Ill cheered him, witless what had caused his grief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He for his sore an evil salve had found,<BR>
And, where he should retire, encreased his woes;<BR>
Who, with the mention of his wife, that wound<BR>
Inflamed and opened, which he sought to close.<BR>
He rests not night nor day, in sorrow drowned;<BR>
His appetite is gone, with his repose,<BR>
Ne&#8217;er to return; and (whilom of such fame)<BR>
His lovely visage seems no more the same.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;His eye-balls seem deep-buried in his head,<BR>
His nose seems grown&#8212;his cheeks are pined so sore&#8212;<BR>
Nor even remains (his beauty so is fled)<BR>
Enough to warrant what he was before.<BR>
Such fever burns him, of his sorrow bred,<BR>
He halts on Arbia&#8217;s and on Arno&#8217;s shore;<BR>
And, if a charm is left, &#8217;tis faded soon,<BR>
And withered like a rose-bud plucked at noon.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Besides that Faustus sorrowed to descry<BR>
Him so bested; worse cause for sorrowing<BR>
Was to that courtier to appear to lie<BR>
Before Astolpho; he was pledged to bring<BR>
One that was fairest deemed in every eye,<BR>
Who must appear the foulest to that king;<BR>
Yet he continued on his way to wend,<BR>
And brought him to Pavia in the end.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Not that forthwith he lets the youth be seen,<BR>
Lest him the king of little wit arraign;<BR>
He first by his dispatches lets him ween,<BR>
That thither he Jocundo brings with pain:<BR>
Saying, that of his beauteous air and mien<BR>
Some secret cause of grief had been the bane,<BR>
Accompanied by a distemper sore:<BR>
So that he seemed not what he was before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Glad was the monarch, of his coming taught,<BR>
As of a friend&#8217;s arrival he could be;<BR>
Since in the universal world was nought,<BR>
That he so much desired as him to see:<BR>
Nor was the Lombard&#8217;s king displeased in ought<BR>
To mark his guest&#8217;s inferiority;<BR>
Though, but for his misfortune, it was clear,<BR>
He his superior would have been or peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Lodged by him in his palace, every day<BR>
And every hour, the stranger youth he sees,<BR>
Studious to honour him, and bids purvey<BR>
Store of provision for his better ease.<BR>
While still his thoughts to his ill consort stray,<BR>
Jocundo languishes; nor pastimes please<BR>
That melancholy man; nor music&#8217;s strain<BR>
One jot diminishes his ceaseless pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Above his chambers, on the upper floor,<BR>
Nearest the roof, there was an ancient hall:<BR>
Thither, in solitary mood, (for sore<BR>
Pastime and company, the stripling gall,)<BR>
He aye betakes himself; while evermore<BR>
Sad thoughts some newer cause of grief recall.<BR>
He here (who would believe the story?) found<BR>
A remedy unhoped, which made him sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;At that hall&#8217;s farther end, more feebly lighted,<BR>
(For windows ever closed shut out the day)<BR>
Where one wall with another ill united,<BR>
He, through the chink, beheld a brighter ray:<BR>
There laid his eye, and saw, what he had slighted<BR>
As hard to credit, were it but hearsay:<BR>
He hears it not, but this himself descries;<BR>
Yet hardly can believe his very eyes.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He of the Queen&#8217;s apartment here was sight,<BR>
Her choicest and her priviest chamber, where<BR>
Was never introduced whatever wight,<BR>
Save he most faithful was esteemed: he there,<BR>
As he was peeping, saw an uncouth fight;<BR>
A dwarf was wrestling with the royal fair;<BR>
And such that champion&#8217;s skill, though undergrown,<BR>
He in the strife his opposite had thrown.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As in a dream, Jocundo stood, beside<BR>
Himself, awhile of sober sense bereaved;<BR>
Nor, but when of the matter certified,<BR>
And sure it was no dream, his sight believed.<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;A scorned and crooked monster,&#8217; (then he cried,)<BR>
&#8216;Is, as her conqueror, by a dame received,<BR>
Wife of the comeliest, of the curtiest wight,<BR>
And greatest monarch; Oh! what appetite!&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And he the consort to whom he was wed,<BR>
Her he most used to blame, recalled to mind,<BR>
And, for the stripling taken to her bed,<BR>
To deem the dame less culpable inclined:<BR>
Less of herself than sex the fault he read,<BR>
Which to one man could never be confined:<BR>
And thought, if in one taint all women shared,<BR>
At least his had not with a monster paired.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To the same place Jocundo made return,<BR>
At the same hour, upon the following day;<BR>
And, putting on the king the self-same scorn,<BR>
Again beheld that dwarf and dame at play:<BR>
And so upon the next and following morn;<BR>
For&#8212;to conclude&#8212;they made no holiday:<BR>
While she (what most Jocundo&#8217;s wonder moved)<BR>
The pigmy for his little love reproved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;One day, amid the rest, the youth surveyed<BR>
The dame disordered and opprest with gloom;<BR>
Having twice summoned, by her waiting-maid,<BR>
The favoured dwarf, who yet delayed to come;<BR>
A third time by the lady sent, she said:<BR>
&#8212;&#8216;Engaged at play, Madonna, is the groom,<BR>
Nor, lest he lose a doit, his paltry stake,<BR>
Will that discourteous churl his game forsake.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;At such strange spectacle, the Roman knight<BR>
Cleared up his brow, his visage and his eyes;<BR>
He jocund, as in name, became in sprite,<BR>
And changed his tears for smiles; with altered guise,<BR>
He waxed ruddy, gay, and plump in plight,<BR>
And seems a cherubim of Paradise.<BR>
So that such change with wonderment all see,<BR>
Brother and king, and royal family.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;If from the youth Astolpho wished to know<BR>
From whence this sudden light of comfort came,<BR>
No less Jocundo this desired to show,<BR>
And to the king such injury proclaim:<BR>
But willed that like himself he should forego<BR>
Revenge upon the author of that shame.<BR>
Hence, that he might discern her guilt, yet spare,<BR>
He made him on the Agnus Dei swear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;He made him swear that he, for nothing said,<BR>
Or seen, which might to him displeasing be,<BR>
(Though he, in what he should discover, read<BR>
An outrage offered to his majesty,)<BR>
Would, now or ever, venge him on his head:<BR>
Moreover him he bound to secrecy;<BR>
That the ill doer ne&#8217;er, through deed or word,<BR>
Might guess his injured king that case had heard.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The monarch, who to every thing beside<BR>
Could better have given credit, freely swore:<BR>
To him the cause Jocundo signified,<BR>
Why he had many days lamenting sore;<BR>
&#8212;Because he had his evil wife espied<BR>
In the embraces of a serjeant poor;<BR>
And vowed he should in fine have died of grief,<BR>
If he for longer time had lacked relief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;But that within his highness&#8217; palace said,<BR>
He had witnessed what had much appeased his woe;<BR>
For, if foul shame had fallen upon his head,<BR>
At least he was not single; saying so,<BR>
He to that chink the Lombard monarch led,<BR>
Who spied the mannikin of hideous show.<BR>
   (Lines 7 & 8 untranslated by Rose)</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;You may believe he shameless deemed that act,<BR>
Without my swearing it; he, at the sight,<BR>
It seemed, would go distraught,&#8212;with fury racked,<BR>
He against every wall his head would smite&#8212;<BR>
Would cry aloud&#8212;would break the solemn pact,<BR>
Yet kept parforce the promise he had plight;<BR>
And gulped his anger down and bitter scorn;<BR>
Since on the holy water he had sworn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Then to Jocundo: &#8216;What remains to me<BR>
To do in this misfortune, brother, speak;<BR>
Since vengeance with more noted cruelty<BR>
Thou wilt not let me on the sinners wreak.&#8217;<BR>
(Jocundo answered) &#8216;Let these ingrates be;<BR>
And try we if all women are as weak;<BR>
And if the wives of others can be won<BR>
To do what others by our own have done.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Both fair and youthful, measured by this scale,<BR>
Nor easily our equals shall we find;<BR>
What woman but to us shall strike her sail,<BR>
If even to the ugly these are kind?<BR>
At least, if neither youth nor grace avail,<BR>
The money may, with which our bags are lined;<BR>
Nor will I that we homeward more return,<BR>
Ere the chief spoils we from a thousand earn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Long absence, seeing with a distant part,<BR>
Converse with different women, oft allay,<BR>
As it would seem, the troubles of a heart,<BR>
Whereof Love&#8217;s angry passions make their prey.&#8217;<BR>
The king is pleased to hear the youth impart<BR>
This counsel, nor his journey will delay:<BR>
Thence on their road, with but two squires beside,<BR>
He and the Roman knight together ride.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Disguised they go through France and Italy,<BR>
They Flanders next and England scower, and where<BR>
A woman they of lovely visage spy,<BR>
Aye find the dame complaint with their prayer.<BR>
They upon some bestow what others buy,<BR>
And oft replaced their squandered treasures are.<BR>
Our travellers to the wives of many sued,<BR>
And by as many other dames were wooed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;By solid proof those comrades ascertain,<BR>
Here tarrying for a month, and there for two,<BR>
That their own wives are of no other vein<BR>
Than those of others, and as chast and true.<BR>
After some season, wearied are the twain<BR>
With ever running after something new:<BR>
For, without risk of death, thus evermore<BR>
The intruders ill could enter other&#8217;s door.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8212;&#8217;Twere best to find a girl whose natural bent<BR>
And face to both of us should pleasing be;<BR>
A girl, that us in common might content,<BR>
Nor we in her find cause for jealousy;<BR>
And wherefore wouldst thou that I should lament<BR>
More than with other, to go halves with thee?&#8217;<BR>
(Exclaimed Astolpho) &#8216;well I know is none,<BR>
Of all the female sex, content with one.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;One damsel that in nought shall us constrain,<BR>
&#8212;Then only, when disposed to please the fair&#8212;<BR>
Will we in peace and pleasure entertain,<BR>
Nor we, about her, have dispute or care.<BR>
Nor, deem I, she with reason could complain:<BR>
For if two fell to every other&#8217;s share,<BR>
Better than one might she keep faith with two;<BR>
Nor haply we such frequent discord view.&#8217;</TD></TR>

&#8220;Much seems the king&#8217;s proposal to content<BR>
The Roman youth; and thus it is, the twain,<BR>
To execute Astolpho&#8217;s project bent,<BR>
Journey by many a hill and many a plain;<BR>
And find at last, well fitting their intent,<BR>
The daughter of a publican of Spain,<BR>
Of presence and of manners framed to win;<BR>
Whose father at Valencia kept his inn.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
As yet, upon the bloom of spring, the maid<BR>
Was a fresh flower that scarce began to blow:<BR>
Her sire with many children was o&#8217;erlaid,<BR>
And was to poverty a mortal foe.<BR>
Hence &#8217;tis an easy matter to persuade<BR>
Mine host his buxom daughter to forego,<BR>
And let them, where they will the damsel bear;<BR>
In that to treat her well the travellers swear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
   (Lines 1-6 untranslated by Rose)<BR>
They to Zattiva come upon the day<BR>
That from Valencia they had bent their way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The travellers from their inn to street and square<BR>
And places, public and divine, resort;<BR>
Who, wheresoever they had made repair,<BR>
Themselves were so accustomed to disport,<BR>
The girl is with the valets left in care,<BR>
Who make the beds, and wearied hackneys sort:<BR>
While others in the hostel-kitchen dight<BR>
The meal against their lords&#8217; return at night.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;As groom, a stripling in the hostel plied,<BR>
Who in the other landlord&#8217;s house had been:<BR>
He, from her childhood at the damsel&#8217;s side,<BR>
Had joyed her love: they, without change of mien,<BR>
On meeting, closely one another eyed,<BR>
Since either apprehended to be seen:<BR>
But when alone&#8212;now left together&#8212;raised<BR>
Their eyelids and on one another gazed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The stripling asked her whitherward they sped,<BR>
And of the two which claimed her as his right;<BR>
This, point by point, to him Flammetta read;<BR>
Flammetta she, the Greek that boy was hight.<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;When I had hoped the time was coming,&#8217; said<BR>
The Greek&#8212;&#8216;that I should live with thee, my light,<BR>
Flammetta, thou, alas! art lost to me,<BR>
Nor know I if I more thy face shall see.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I to the bitter dregs the cup must drain<BR>
Of promised sweets; since thou art others&#8217; prey.<BR>
&#8217;Twas my design, having with mickle pain<BR>
And labour sore, some money put away,<BR>
Which I had hoarded out of frequent gain<BR>
From parting guests, and from my yearly pay,<BR>
To seek again Valencia, and demand<BR>
Thee from thy sire in lawful wedlock&#8217;s band.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;The damsel shrugs her shoulders, and complains;<BR>
And&#8212;that he is too late&#8212;is her reply.<BR>
The Greek laments and sobs, and partly feigns:<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;Wilt thou (he answered her) thus let me die?<BR>
Let me, at least, exhale my amorous pains!<BR>
Let me, but once, in thine embrace lie!<BR>
For every moment in thy presence spent,<BR>
Ere thou depart, will make me die content.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To him the damsel, full of pity, cries:<BR>
&#8216;Believe, I covet this no less than thee;<BR>
But here, surrounded by so many eyes,<BR>
Is neither time nor opportunity.&#8217;<BR>
&#8216;&#8212;I feel assured&#8217; (to her that youth replied)<BR>
&#8216;Were I beloved by you, as you by me,<BR>
This very night you would find out a place<BR>
Wherein to solace us some little space.&#8217;</TD></TR>

&#8220;She bade him come&#8212;when she awhile had thought&#8212;<BR>
When he believed that all asleep were laid;<BR>
And how by him her chamber should be sought,<BR>
And how he should return, at full, displaid.<BR>
The cautious stripling did as he was taught,<BR>
And, when he found all silent, thither made:<BR>
He pushed, till it gave way, the chamber-door,<BR>
And, upon tiptoes, softly paced the floor.<BR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Gazing on one another, with surprise,<BR>
The monarch and Jocundo are confused;<BR>
Nor even to have heard a case surmise<BR>
Of two, that ever thus had been abused:<BR>
Then laughed so, that they sate with winking eyes,<BR>
And open mouth, and lungs which breath refused;<BR>
And, wearied with the mirth her tale had bred,<BR>
Fell backwards, both, exhausted on the bed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When they had laughed so loud a laugh, the dew<BR>
Stood in their eyes, and each with aching breast<BR>
Remained, the pair exclaimed: &#8216;What shall we do<BR>
In order not to be a woman&#8217;s jest?<BR>
Since we, with all our heed, between us two,<BR>
Could not preserve the one by us possest,<BR>
A husband, furnished with more eyes than hair,<BR>
Perforce must be betrayed with all his care.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;A thousand, beauteous all, have we found kind,<BR>
Nor one of those so many has stood fast.<BR>
If tried, all women we by proof should find<BR>
Like these; but be the experiment our last.<BR>
Then we may deem our own not worse inclined<BR>
Than are the wives of others, and as chaste:<BR>
And, if like others we our own discern,<BR>
I hold it best that we to them return.&#8217;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;When they have come to this resolve, they, through<BR>
Flammetta, call the youth into their bower;<BR>
And with the girl her leman, in the view<BR>
Of many, gift, and add a fitting dower.<BR>
They mount, and to the east their way pursue,<BR>
Accustomed westward hitherto to scower;<BR>
To their deserted wives again repair,<BR>
Nor of their after deeds take farther care.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
Here paused mine host; to whom on every side<BR>
His audience had with careful heed attended.<BR>
Rodomont listened, nor a word replied,<BR>
Until the landlord&#8217;s story was suspended.<BR>
Then&#8212;&#8220;Fully I believe,&#8221; that paynim cried,<BR>
&#8220;The tale of women&#8217;s frauds would ne&#8217;er be ended;<BR>
Nor could that man in any volume note<BR>
The thousandth part, who would their treasons quote.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
Of sounder judgement, &#8217;mid that company,<BR>
There was an elder, one more wise and bold;<BR>
That undefended so the sex to see,<BR>
Was inly wroth, and could no longer hold:<BR>
To the relater of that history<BR>
He turned; and, &#8220;Many things we have been told&#8221;<BR>
(Exclaimed that ancient) &#8220;wherein truth is none,<BR>
And of such matters is thy fable one.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Him I believe not, that told this truth to you,<BR>
Though in all else he gospel-truths exprest;<BR>
As less by his experience, than untrue<BR>
Conceit respecting women prepossest.<BR>
The malice which he bears to one or two,<BR>
Makes him unjustly hate and blame the rest.<BR>
But you shall hear him, if his wrath o&#8217;erblow,<BR>
Yet greater praise than blame on these bestow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And he a larger field for speaking well<BR>
Will find, than blaming womankind withal;<BR>
And of a hundred worthy fame may tell,<BR>
For one whose evil deeds for censure call.<BR>
He should exalt the many that excel,<BR>
Culled from the multitude, not rail at all,<BR>
If otherwise your friend Valerio said,<BR>
He was by wrath, and not by reason, led.<BR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
So reasoning, that just elder and sincere,<BR>
With ready instances, supports his creed;<BR>
Showing there many women are who ne&#8217;er<BR>
Sinned against chastity, in word or deed:<BR>
But him with impious visage and severe<BR>
The paynim scared, ill pleased the truth to read.<BR>
So that, through fear, he further speech forbore,<BR>
But changed not therefore aught his former lore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Having stopt further question in this wise,<BR>
The paynim monarch from the table rose:<BR>
Then lays him on his bed, till from the skies<BR>
The dusky shades depart, and morning glows:<BR>
But spends a larger part of night in sighs<BR>
At his liege-lady&#8217;s sin, than in repose.<BR>
Rodomont thence departs at dawn of day,<BR>
Resolved by water to pursue his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
For with such care for his good horse&#8217;s plight,<BR>
As is becoming a good cavalier,<BR>
The courser fair and good, made his in spite<BR>
Of young Rogero and Circassia&#8217;s peer;<BR>
Seeing he, for two days, that horse&#8217;s might<BR>
Had taxed too hardly in his long career,<BR>
&#8212;As well he for his ease embarked the steed,<BR>
As to pursue his way with better speed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
He straight makes launch the vessel from the marge,<BR>
And bids put forth the oars from either side:<BR>
Nor big nor deeply laden, she, at large,<BR>
Descends the Saone, transported by the tide.<BR>
Care never quits him, though the shifting barge<BR>
The king ascend, or nimble horse bestride:<BR>
This he encounters aye on prow or poop,<BR>
And bears behind him on his courser&#8217;s croup;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Rather within his head or heart always<BR>
Care sits; whence every comfort is o&#8217;erthrown:<BR>
No remedy the wretched man surveys,<BR>
In that his enemies are in the town.<BR>
From others hope is none; since they who raise<BR>
This fearful war against him, are his own:<BR>
Vext by that cruel one, aye night and day,<BR>
Whom he might hope to find his natural stay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Rodomont navigates the day and night<BR>
Ensuing, aye by heavy thoughts opprest;<BR>
Nor can he ever banish the despite,<BR>
Suffered from King and Lady, from his breast.<BR>
The self-same grief sate heavy on his sprite<BR>
Aboard the bark, as when his steed he prest.<BR>
Such fire was not by water to be drowned,<BR>
Nor he his nature changed by changing ground.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
As the sick man who with a fever grows,<BR>
And, weak and weary, shifts his place in vain,<BR>
Whether he right or left himself bestows,<BR>
And hopes in turning some relief to gain,<BR>
Finds neither on this side nor that repose,<BR>
But everywhere encounters equal pain;<BR>
The pagan monarch so found small relief,<BR>
By land or water, for his secret grief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Rodomont brooked no more aboard to stay,<BR>
But bade them land him, and by Lyons hied;<BR>
By Vienne and Valence next took his way,<BR>
And the rich bridge in Avignon descried.<BR>
For these and more, which &#8217;twixt the river lay<BR>
And Celtiberian hills upon that side,<BR>
(Theirs, from the day they conquered the champaigne)<BR>
Obeyed the kings of Afric and of Spain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
To pass to Afric straight, the cavalier<BR>
Kept to the right, towards Acquamorta&#8217;s shore,<BR>
And lighted on a stream and hamlet, dear<BR>
To Ceres and to Bacchus, which that Moor<BR>
Found quitted by the peasants, in their fear,<BR>
As often by the soldier harried sore.<BR>
The beach upon one side broad ocean laved,<BR>
And on the other yellow harvests waved.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Here, newly built upon a hillock&#8217;s crest,<BR>
A little church the Saracen espied;<BR>
Abandoned by its priesthood, like the rest,<BR>
For war was flaming upon every side.<BR>
Rodomont of this place himself possest;<BR>
Which, from its site, as well as lying wide<BR>
Of fields, from whence he tidings loathed to hear,<BR>
So pleased him, he for it renounced Argier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
He changed his scheme of seeking Afric&#8217;s land,<BR>
(So this fair spot seemed fit for his behoof!)<BR>
And here housed carriages, and steed, and band,<BR>
Together with himself, beneath one roof,<BR>
At few leagues&#8217; distance, did Montpelier stand,<BR>
And other wealthy towns, not far aloof.<BR>
The village was upon a river&#8217;s side,<BR>
So that its every need might be supplied.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
Here standing, full of thought, upon a day,<BR>
(Such was his common wont) the paynim spied,<BR>
Advancing by a narrow path, which lay<BR>
Through a green meadow, from the adverse side,<BR>
A lovely damsel, that upon her way<BR>
Was by a bearded monk accompanied;<BR>
And these behind them led a lusty steed,<BR>
Who bore a burden, trapt with sable weed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
Who that attendant monk and damsel were,<BR>
And what that burden, will to you be clear,<BR>
Remembering Isabella is the fair,<BR>
Charged with the corse of her Zerbino dear:<BR>
I left her, where from Provence, in the care<BR>
Of that good sire, she bowned herself to steer,<BR>
By whom persuaded, had the lady given<BR>
The remnant of her virtuous life to heaven.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
Although in her pale face and troubled guise,<BR>
The sorrow of that dame is manifest,<BR>
Although two fountains are her streaming eyes,<BR>
And sobs aye issue from her burning breast,<BR>
And more beside of suffering testifies,<BR>
With what a load of grief she is opprest,<BR>
Yet, in her faded cheek such beauties meet,<BR>
Love and the Graces there might fix their seat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
As soon as he of Sarza saw appear<BR>
The beauteous dame, he laid the thought aside<BR>
Of hatred to that gentle race and dear,<BR>
By whom alone the world is glorified;<BR>
And best by Isabel the cavalier<BR>
Believed his former love would be supplied,<BR>
And one love by another be effaced,<BR>
As bolt by bolt in timber is displaced.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Her with the kindest mien and mildest tone<BR>
That he could fashion, met the Sarzan knight;<BR>
To whom the dame her every thought made known;<BR>
And said, when she was questioned of her plight,<BR>
She would with holy works&#8212;this world forgone&#8212;<BR>
Seek favour in her Heavenly Father&#8217;s sight.<BR>
Loud laughed that godless paynim at the thought,<BR>
Who every faith and worship held at nought;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
And said that she from reason wandered wide,<BR>
And termed her project sudden and unsound;<BR>
Nor deemed her less to blame than those who hide,<BR>
Through greediness, their treasure under ground,<BR>
And keep it from the use of all beside,<BR>
Though hence no profit to themselves redound.<BR>
Rightly were prisoned lion, snake, and bear,<BR>
But ill whate&#8217;er is innocent and fair.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
The monk, that to this talk has lent an ear,<BR>
Prompt with advice that mournful dame to stay,<BR>
And lest she quit her course, prepared to steer<BR>
His bark, like practised pilot, on her way,<BR>
A sumptuous table, rich in spiritual cheer,<BR>
Had speedily bestirred him to array;<BR>
But, born with evil taste, that paynim rude<BR>
No sooner tasted, than he loathed, the food.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
And having interrupted him in vain,<BR>
Nor having power to make him stint his lore,<BR>
That paynim, stirred to fury, broke the rein<BR>
Of patience, and assailed the preacher hoar.<BR>
But haply wearisome might seem the strain,<BR>
If I upon this theme dilated more:<BR>
So here I close, nor words will idly spend,<BR>
Admonished by that ancient&#8217;s evil end.</TD></TR>
