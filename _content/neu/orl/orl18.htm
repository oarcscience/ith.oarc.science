<TR><TD align=center><SMALL>ARGUMENT.</SMALL></TD></TR><TR><TD><SMALL><I>
Gryphon is venged. Sir Mandricardo goes<BR>
In search of Argier&#8217;s king. Charles wins the fight.<BR>
Marphisa Norandino&#8217;s men o&#8217;erthrows.<BR>
Due pains Martano&#8217;s cowardice requite.<BR>
A favouring wind Marphisa&#8217;s gallery blows,<BR>
For France with Gryphon bound and many a knight.<BR>
The field Medoro and Cloridano tread,<BR>
And find their monarch Dardinello dead.</I></SMALL></TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>I.</TD><TD>
High minded lord! your actions evermore<BR>
I have with reason lauded, and still laud;<BR>
Though I with style inapt, and rustic lore,<BR>
You of large portion of your praise defraud:<BR>
But, of your many virtues, one before<BR>
All others I with heart and tongue applaud,<BR>
&#8212;That, if each man a gracious audience finds,<BR>
No easy faith your equal judgment blinds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>II.</TD><TD>
Often, to shield the absent one from blame,<BR>
I hear you this, or other, thing adduce;<BR>
Or him you let, at least, an audience claim,<BR>
Where still one ear is open to excuse:<BR>
And before dooming men to scaith and shame,<BR>
To see and hear them ever is your use;<BR>
And ere you judge another, many a day,<BR>
And month, and year, your sentence to delay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>III.</TD><TD>
Had Norandine been with your care endued,<BR>
What he by Gryphon did, he had not done.<BR>
Profit and fame have from your rule accrued:<BR>
A stain more black than pitch he cast upon<BR>
His name: through him, his people were pursued<BR>
And put to death by Olivero&#8217;s son;<BR>
Who at ten cuts or thrusts, in fury made,<BR>
Some thirty dead about the waggon laid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IV.</TD><TD>
Whither fear drives, in rout, the others all,<BR>
Some scattered here, some there, on every side,<BR>
Fill road and field; to gain the city-wall<BR>
Some strive, and smothered in the mighty tide,<BR>
One on another, in the gateway fall.<BR>
Gryphon, all thought of pity laid aside,<BR>
Threats not nor speaks, but whirls his sword about,<BR>
Well venging on the crowd their every flout.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>V.</TD><TD>
Of those who to the portal foremost fleed,<BR>
The readiest of the crowd their feet to ply,<BR>
Part, more intent upon their proper need<BR>
Than their friends&#8217; peril, raise the draw-bridge high:<BR>
Part, weeping and with deathlike visage, speed,<BR>
Nor turn their eyes behind them as they fly:<BR>
While, through the ample city, outcry loud,<BR>
And noise, and tumult rises from the crowd.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VI.</TD><TD>
Two nimble Gryphon seizes, mid the train,<BR>
When to their woe the bridge is raised; of one,<BR>
Upon the field the warrior strews the brain,<BR>
Which he bears out on a hard grinding stone;<BR>
Seized by the breast, the other of the twain<BR>
Over the city-wall by him is thrown,<BR>
Fear chills the townsmen&#8217;s marrow, when they spy<BR>
The luckless wretch descending from the sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VII.</TD><TD>
Many there were who feared in their alarms,<BR>
Lest o&#8217;er the wall Sir Gryphon would have vaulted;<BR>
Nor greater panic seized upon those swarms,<BR>
Than if the soldan had the town assaulted.<BR>
The sound of running up and down, of arms,<BR>
Of cry of Muezzins, on high exalted;<BR>
Of drums and trumpets, heaven, &#8217;twould seem, rebounded,<BR>
And, that the world was by the noise confounded.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>VIII.</TD><TD>
But I will to another time delay,<BR>
What chanced on this occasion, to recount.<BR>
&#8217;Tis meet I follow Charles upon his way,<BR>
Hurrying in search of furious Rodomont,<BR>
Who did the monarch&#8217;s suffering people slay.<BR>
I said, with him, the danger to affront,<BR>
Went Namus, Oliver, the Danish peer,<BR>
Avino, Avolio, Otho and Berlinghier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>IX.</TD><TD>
Eight lances&#8217; shock, that eight such warriors guide,<BR>
Which all at once against the king they rest,<BR>
Endured the stout and scaly serpent&#8217;s hide,<BR>
In which the cruel Moor his limbs had drest.<BR>
As a barque rights itself,&#8212;the sheet untied,<BR>
Which held its sail,&#8212;by growing wind opprest;<BR>
So speedily Sir Rodomont arose,<BR>
Though a hill had been uprooted by the blows.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>X.</TD><TD>
Rainier and Guido, Richard, Salomon,<BR>
Ivan, Ughetto, Turpin, and the twain&#8212;<BR>
Angiolin, Angelier&#8212;false Ganellon,<BR>
And Mark and Matthew from St. Michael&#8217;s plain,<BR>
With the eight of whom I spake, all set upon<BR>
The foe, with Edward and Sir Arimane;<BR>
Who leading succours from the English shore,<BR>
Had lodged them in the town short time before.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XI.</TD><TD>
Not so, well-keyed into the solid stone,<BR>
Groans upon Alpine height the castle good,<BR>
When by rude Boreas&#8217; rage or Eurus&#8217; strown,<BR>
Uptorn are ash and fir in mountain wood,<BR>
As groans Sir Rodomont, with pride o&#8217;erblown,<BR>
Inflamed with anger and with thirst of blood:<BR>
And, as the thunder and the lightning&#8217;s fire<BR>
Fly coupled, such his vengeance and his ire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XII.</TD><TD>
He at his head took aim who stood most nigh;<BR>
Ughetto was the miserable wight,<BR>
Whom to the teeth he clove, and left to die;<BR>
Though of good temper was his helmet bright.<BR>
As well the others many strokes let fly<BR>
At him, himself; which all the warrior smite,<BR>
But harm (so hard the dragon&#8217;s hide) no more,<BR>
Than needle can the solid anvil score.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIII.</TD><TD>
All the defences, round, abandoned are,<BR>
The unpeopled city is abandoned all;<BR>
For, where the danger is the greater, there<BR>
The many give their aid, at Charles&#8217; call:<BR>
Through every street they hurry to the square,<BR>
Since flying nought avails, from work and wall.<BR>
Their bosoms so the monarch&#8217;s presence warms,<BR>
That each again takes courage, each takes arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIV.</TD><TD>
As when within the closely-fastened cage<BR>
Of an old lioness, well used to fight,<BR>
An untamed bull is prisoned, to engage<BR>
The savage monster, for the mob&#8217;s delight;<BR>
The cubs, who see him cresting in his rage,<BR>
And round the den loud-bellowing, to the sight<BR>
Of the huge beast&#8217;s enormous horns unused,<BR>
Cower at a distance, timid and confused;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XV.</TD><TD>
But if the mother spring at him, and hang,<BR>
Fixing her cruel tusks into his ear,<BR>
Her whelps as well will blood their greedy fang,<BR>
And, bold in her defence, assail the steer:<BR>
One bites his paunch, and one his back: so sprang<BR>
That band upon the paynim cavalier.<BR>
From roof and window, and from place more nigh,<BR>
Poured in a ceaseless shower, the weapons fly.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVI.</TD><TD>
Of cavaliers and footmen such the squeeze,<BR>
That hardly can the place the press contain:<BR>
They cluster there as thick as swarming bees,<BR>
Who thither from each passage troop amain.<BR>
So that, were they unarmed, and with more ease<BR>
Than stalks or turnips he could cleave the train,<BR>
Ill Rodomont in twenty days would clear<BR>
The gathering crowd, united far and near.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVII.</TD><TD>
Unknowing how himself from thence to free,<BR>
The paynim by this game is angered sore,<BR>
Who little thins the gathering rabblery,<BR>
Staining the ground with thousands slain or more;<BR>
And all the while, in his extremity,<BR>
Finds that his breath comes thicker than before;<BR>
And sees he cannot pierce the hostile round,<BR>
Unless he thence escape while strong and sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XVIII.</TD><TD>
The monarch rolls about his horrid eyes,<BR>
And sees that foes all outlets barricade;<BR>
But, at the cost of countless enemies,<BR>
A path shall quickly by his hand be made.<BR>
Where Fury calls him, lo! the felon hies,<BR>
And brandishes on high his trenchant blade,<BR>
To assail the newly entered British band,<BR>
Which Edward and Sir Ariman command.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XIX.</TD><TD>
He who has seen the fence, in well-thonged square,<BR>
(Against whose stakes the eddying crowd is born)<BR>
By wild bull broken, that has had to bear,<BR>
Through the long day, dogs, blows, and ceaseless scorn;<BR>
Who hunts the scattered people here and there,<BR>
And this, or that, now hoists upon his horn;<BR>
Let him as such, or fiercer yet, account,<BR>
When he breaks forth, the cruel Rodomont.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XX.</TD><TD>
At one cross-blow fifteen or twenty foes<BR>
He hews, as many leaves without a bead,<BR>
At cross or downright-stroke; as if he rows<BR>
Trashes in vineyard or in willow-bed,<BR>
At last all smeared with blood the paynim goes,<BR>
Safe from the place, which he has heaped with dead;<BR>
And wheresoe&#8217;er he turns his steps, are left<BR>
Heads, arms, and other members, maimed and cleft.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXI.</TD><TD>
He from the square retires in such a mode,<BR>
None can perceive that danger him appals;<BR>
But, during this, what were the safest road,<BR>
By which to sally, he to thought recals.<BR>
He comes at last to where the river flowed<BR>
Below the isle, and past without the walls.<BR>
In daring men at arms and mob increase,<BR>
Who press him sore, nor let him part in peace.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXII.</TD><TD>
As the high-couraged beast, whom hunters start<BR>
In the wild Nomade or Massilian chace,<BR>
Who, even in flying, shows his noble heart,<BR>
And threatening seeks his lair with sluggish pace;<BR>
From that strange wood of sword, and spear, and dart,<BR>
Turns Rodomont, with action nothing base;<BR>
And still impeded by the galling foe,<BR>
Makes for the river with long steps and slow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIII.</TD><TD>
He turned upon the rabble-rout who bayed<BR>
Behind him, thrice or more, by anger driven,<BR>
And stained anew his falchion, by whose blade<BR>
More than a hundred deadly wounds were given.<BR>
But reason, finally, his fury stayed<BR>
Before the bloody carnage stank to heaven;<BR>
And he, with better counsel, from the side<BR>
Cast himself down into Seine&#8217;s foaming tide.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIV.</TD><TD>
Athwart the current swam, with arms and all,<BR>
As if by corks upborn, the cavalier.<BR>
Though thou Antaeus bred&#8217;st, and Hannibal,<BR>
O Africa! thou never bred&#8217;st his peer!&#8212;<BR>
When now across the stream, without the wall,<BR>
He turned, and saw the royal town appear,<BR>
&#8212;To have traversed all the city moved his ire,<BR>
Leaving it undestroyed by sword or fire;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXV.</TD><TD>
And him so sorely anger stung and pride,<BR>
Thither he thought a second time to go;<BR>
And from his inmost bosom groaned and sighed,<BR>
Nor would depart until he laid it low.<BR>
But he saw one along the river-side<BR>
Approach, who made him rage and hate forego;<BR>
Strait shall you hear who &#8217;twas, approached the king,<BR>
But first I have to say of other thing.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVI.</TD><TD>
I have of haughty Discord now to say,<BR>
To whom the archangel Michael gave command,<BR>
To heat to enmity and fierce affray<BR>
The best of Agramant&#8217;s besieging band.<BR>
She went that evening from the abbey gray,<BR>
Her task committing to another&#8217;s hand;<BR>
&#8212;Left it to Fraud to feed, till her return,<BR>
The war, and make the fires she kindled burn;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVII.</TD><TD>
And she believed, that she with greater power<BR>
Should go, did Pride with her as well repair;<BR>
And she (for all were guested in one bower)<BR>
In search of her had little way to fare.<BR>
Pride went with her; but, that in hall or tower,<BR>
A vicar too her charge might duly bear,<BR>
She for those days she absent thought to be,<BR>
For her lieutenant left Hypocrisy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXVIII.</TD><TD>
The implacable Discord went, and with the dame,<BR>
(Companion of the enterprise, was Pride)<BR>
Upon her road; and found that, by the same,<BR>
Was journeying to the paynim camp, beside,<BR>
Comfortless Jealousy, with whom there came<BR>
A little dwarf, attending as a guide;<BR>
Who erst had been sent forward with advice<BR>
To Sarza&#8217;s king, by beauteous Doralice.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXIX.</TD><TD>
When she fell into Mandricardo&#8217;s hand,<BR>
(I have before recounted when and where)<BR>
She had in secret given the dwarf command,<BR>
He to the king should with the tidings fare;<BR>
By whom she hoped not vainly would be scanned<BR>
The tale her messenger was charged to bear,<BR>
But wonderous deeds be done for her relief,<BR>
With sad and signal vengeance on the thief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXX.</TD><TD>
Jealousy had that little dwarf espied,<BR>
And kenned the reason of his mission too,<BR>
And joined him, journeying with him side by side,<BR>
Deeming that she therein a part might do.<BR>
Discord, with pleasure, Jealousy decried,<BR>
But with more joy, when she the occasion knew<BR>
Which thither brought the dame, who much (she wist)<BR>
Might in the task she had in hand assist.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXI.</TD><TD>
Of means to embroil the Sarzan and the son<BR>
Of Agrican, she deems herself possest.<BR>
A certain mode to enrage these two is won;<BR>
And other means may work upon the rest.<BR>
She thither with the dwarfish page is gone,<BR>
Where the fierce Pagan in his clutch had prest<BR>
Proud Paris, and they reached the river strand,<BR>
Exactly as the felon swam to land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXII.</TD><TD>
As soon as the redoubted Rodomont<BR>
Knew in the dwarf the courier of his dame,<BR>
He all his rage extinguished, cleared his front,<BR>
And felt his courage brighten into flame.<BR>
All else he deems the courier may recount,<BR>
Save that a wight had wrought him scaith and shame,<BR>
And cries (encountering him with chearful brow)<BR>
&#8220;How fares our lady? wither sent art thou?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Nor mine nor thine that lady will I say,<BR>
Who is another&#8217;s thrall,&#8221; the dwarf replied.<BR>
&#8220;We, on our road, encountered yesterday<BR>
A knight, who seized and bore away the bride.&#8221;<BR>
Jealousy, upon this, took up the play,<BR>
And, cold as asp, embraced the king: her guide<BR>
Pursued his tale, relating how the train,<BR>
Their mistress taken, by one man were slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIV.</TD><TD>
Her flint and steel, fell Discord, as he said,<BR>
Took forth, and somewhile hammered on the stone.<BR>
Pride, underneath, the ready tinder spread,<BR>
And the quick fire was in a moment blown:<BR>
This on the paynim&#8217;s soul so fiercely fed,<BR>
He could not find a resting place: &#8217;mid groan<BR>
And sob he storms, with horrid face and eye,<BR>
Which threat the elements and ample sky.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXV.</TD><TD>
As tiger rages, who in vain descends<BR>
Into her den, and finds herself alone,<BR>
And, circling all the cavern, comprehends,<BR>
At last, that her beloved young are gone;<BR>
To ire, to rage like hers his wrath extends:<BR>
Nor night the king regards, nor rock, nor stone,<BR>
Nor stream:&#8212;Nor length of way nor storm arrest<BR>
The speed with which he on the plunderer prest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVI.</TD><TD>
So raging, to the pigmy dwarf who bore<BR>
The news, exclaimed the king, &#8220;Now hence away!&#8221;<BR>
Nor horse he waits, nor carriage, nor, before<BR>
Departing, deigns to his a word to say.<BR>
He hurries with such speed, that not with more<BR>
The lizard darts at noon across the way.<BR>
Horse had he none, but be he whose he might,<BR>
Would make his own the first which came in sight.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVII.</TD><TD>
Discord at this, who read his secret thought,<BR>
Exclaimed, as she looked smilingly on Pride,<BR>
Through her he to a courser should be brought,<BR>
By which new cause of strife should be supplied;<BR>
And, that by him no other might be caught,<BR>
She from his path would keep all steeds beside;<BR>
And knew already where the prize to seek.<BR>
&#8212;But her I leave, again of Charles to speak.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXVIII.</TD><TD>
When, on the Saracen&#8217;s departure, spent,<BR>
About King Charles, was the consuming flame,<BR>
He ranged his troops anew: some warriors went<BR>
To strengthen feeble posts which succours claim;<BR>
The rest against the Saracens are sent,<BR>
To give the foe checkmate and end the game;<BR>
And from St. German&#8217;s to Saint Victor&#8217;s gates,<BR>
He pours the host, which on his signal waits.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XXXIX.</TD><TD>
He these at Saint Marcellus&#8217; gate, where lay,<BR>
Outstretched a large circumference of plain,<BR>
Bade one another wait, in one array,<BR>
To reunite against the paynim train.<BR>
Inflaming every one to smite and slay,<BR>
In guise, that for a record should remain,<BR>
He made the various troops fall in below<BR>
Their banners, and the battle-signal blow.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XL.</TD><TD>
Agramant has remounted in his sell,<BR>
While this is doing in his foe&#8217;s despite,<BR>
And with the stripling who loved Isabel,<BR>
Is waging perilous and fearful fight.<BR>
Lurcanio with Sobrino strives as well;<BR>
Rinaldo a troop encounters, whom the knight,<BR>
With Valour and with Fortune for his guide,<BR>
Charges, and breaks, and routs on every side.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLI.</TD><TD>
While so the battle stands, king Charlemagne<BR>
Falls on the rear guard of the paynim foe,<BR>
Where bold Marsilius halts the flower of Spain,<BR>
And forms the host, his royal flag below.<BR>
On these king Charlemagne impels his train,<BR>
Who, foot with horse to flank, against them go.<BR>
While so the deafening drum and trumpet sounds,<BR>
&#8217;Twould seem the spacious world the din rebounds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLII.</TD><TD>
The Saracenic squadrons had begun<BR>
To bend, and all the army of the Moor<BR>
Had turned, disordered, broken, and undone,<BR>
Never to be arrayed or rallied more,<BR>
But that Grandonio stood, and Falsiron,<BR>
Tried oftentimes in greater ill before,<BR>
With Serpentine and Balugantes proud,<BR>
And the renowned Ferrau, who cried aloud:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O valiant men,&#8221; he&#8212;&#8220;O companions,&#8221; cries,<BR>
&#8220;O brethren, stand, and yet your place maintain;<BR>
Like cobweb-threads our cruel enemies<BR>
Will find their works, if we our part sustain.<BR>
What this day Fortune offers to our eyes,<BR>
If now we conquer, see the praise, the gain!&#8212;<BR>
If conquered, see the utter loss and shame<BR>
Which will for ever wait upon your name!&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIV.</TD><TD>
He in this time a mighty lance had spanned,<BR>
And spurred at once against Sir Berlinghier,<BR>
Who Argaliffa guided with his hand,<BR>
And broke his helmet&#8217;s frontal with the spear,<BR>
Cast him on earth, and with the cruel brand<BR>
Unhorsed perhaps eight other warriors near.<BR>
His mighty strokes discharging, at each blow,<BR>
He ever laid at least one horseman low.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLV.</TD><TD>
In other part, Rinaldo, in his mood,<BR>
Has slain more enemies than I can say,<BR>
Before the warlike knight no order stood;<BR>
You might have seen the ample camp give way.<BR>
No less Zerbino and Lurcanio good<BR>
Do deeds, which will be told in every day;<BR>
This, with a thrust, has bold Balastro slain,<BR>
That Finaduro&#8217;s helm has cleft in twain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVI.</TD><TD>
The first was of the Alzerban army head,<BR>
Ruled by Tardocco some short time before;<BR>
The other one the valiant squadrons led<BR>
Of Saphi, and Morocco, and Zamor.<BR>
&#8220;Where, &#8217;mid the paynims,&#8221; might to me be said,<BR>
&#8220;Is knight whose sword can cleave or lance can gore?&#8221;<BR>
But step by step I go, and as I wind<BR>
My way, leave none who merits praise behind.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVII.</TD><TD>
Zumara&#8217;s king is not forgotten here,<BR>
Dardinel, who Sir Dulphin of the mount,<BR>
Claude of the wood, and Hubert, with the spear,<BR>
(Of Mirford he) and Elio did dismount,<BR>
And, with the faulchion, Stamford&#8217;s cavalier,<BR>
Sir Anselm, Raymond and Sir Pinnamont<BR>
From London-town; though valiant were the twain;<BR>
Two stunned, one wounded, the four others slain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLVIII.</TD><TD>
Yet will his squadron not so firmly stand,<BR>
Maugre the valour which his deeds display,<BR>
So firmly, as to wait the Christian band,<BR>
In number less, but steadier in array,<BR>
More used to joust and manage of the brand,<BR>
And all things appertaining to the gray.<BR>
Setta and Morocco turned, and, seized with dread,<BR>
Zumara and Canaries&#8217; islesmen fled.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XLIX.</TD><TD>
But faster than the rest Alzerba flies,<BR>
Whom Dardinel opposed, and now with sore<BR>
Reproach, and now with prayer he moves, and tries<BR>
What best he deems their courage may restore.<BR>
&#8220;If good Almontes has deserved,&#8221; he cries,<BR>
&#8220;That you should by his memory set such store,<BR>
Now shall be seen&#8212;be seen, if you will me,<BR>
His son, abandon in such jeopardy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>L.</TD><TD>
&#8220;For sake of my green youth, I pray you stand,<BR>
That youth whereon your hopes were wont to feed,<BR>
And suffer not that, scattered by the brand,<BR>
To Africa be lost our noble seed.<BR>
Save you united go, be sure the land<BR>
Is shut against you, wheresoe&#8217;er you speed.<BR>
Too high a wall to climb is mountain-steep,<BR>
The yawning sea a ditch too wide to leap.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LI.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Far better &#8217;tis to perish than to be<BR>
Torn by these dogs, or lie at their control.<BR>
Since vain is every other remedy,<BR>
Wait, friends, for love of Heaven, the advancing shoal:<BR>
They are not gifted with more lives than we;<BR>
Have but one pair of hands, have but one soul.&#8221;<BR>
So saying, the bold youth, amid the crew<BR>
Of enemies, the Earl of Huntley slew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LII.</TD><TD>
Almontes&#8217; memory, through the Moorish bands,<BR>
Makes every bosom with such ardour glow,<BR>
They deem &#8217;tis better to use arms and hands<BR>
In fight, than turn their backs upon the foe.<BR>
Taller than all William of Burnwich stands,<BR>
An Englishman, whom Dardinel brings low,<BR>
And equals with the rest; then smites upon,<BR>
And cleaves, the head of Cornish Aramon.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIII.</TD><TD>
Down fell this Aramon, and to afford<BR>
Him succour, thitherward his brother made;<BR>
But from the shoulder him Zumara&#8217;s lord<BR>
Cleft to the fork, with his descending blade;<BR>
Next Bogio de Vergalla&#8217;s belly gored,<BR>
And from his debt absolved (the forfeit paid)<BR>
Who to return within six months, if life<BR>
Were granted him, had promised to his wife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIV.</TD><TD>
Lurcanio next met Dardinello&#8217;s eye;<BR>
He upon earth Dorchino had laid low,<BR>
Pierced through the throat, and hapless Gardo nigh<BR>
Cleft to the teeth; at him, as all too slow,<BR>
He from Altheus vainly seeks to fly,<BR>
Whom as his heart Lurcanio loves, a blow<BR>
Upon his head behind the Scotchman speeds;<BR>
And. slaughtered by the stroke, the warrior bleeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LV.</TD><TD>
Dardinel, to avenge him, took a spear,<BR>
And, should he lay the fierce Lurcanio dead,<BR>
Vowed to his Mahomet, if he could hear,<BR>
The mosque should have his empty arms; this said,<BR>
Ranging the field in haste, that cavalier<BR>
He in the flank, with thrust so full and dread,<BR>
Encountered, that it went through either side:<BR>
And he to his to strip the baron cried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVI.</TD><TD>
From me it sure were needless to demand,<BR>
If Ariodantes, when his brother fell,<BR>
Was grieved; if he with his avenging hand<BR>
Among the damned would send Sir Dardinell;<BR>
But all access the circling troops withstand<BR>
And bar, no less baptized than infidel:<BR>
Yet would he venge himself, and with his blade,<BR>
Now here, now there, an open passage made.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVII.</TD><TD>
He charges, chases, breaks, and overthrows<BR>
Whoever cross him on the crowded plain;<BR>
And Dardinello, who his object knows,<BR>
Would fain the wish content; but him the train<BR>
Impedes as well, which round about him flows,<BR>
And renders aye his every purpose vain.<BR>
If one on all sides thins the Moorish rank,<BR>
The other slays Scot, Englishman, and Frank.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LVIII.</TD><TD>
Fortune still blocked their path throughout the day,<BR>
So that they met not, &#8217;mid that chivalry,<BR>
And kept one as a mightier champion&#8217;s prey;<BR>
For rarely man escapes his destiny.<BR>
Behold the good Rinaldo turns that way!<BR>
That, for this one no refuge there might be.<BR>
Lo! good Rinaldo comes: him Fortune guides,<BR>
And for his sword King Dardinel provides.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LIX.</TD><TD>
But here enough for this one while is shown<BR>
Of their illustrious doings in the west;<BR>
&#8217;Tis time I seek Sir Gryphon, and make known<BR>
How he, with fury burning in his breast,<BR>
That rabble-rout had broke and overthrown,<BR>
Struck with more fear than ever men possest.<BR>
Thither speeds Norandine on that alarm,<BR>
And for his guard above a thousand arm.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LX.</TD><TD>
King Norandine, girt with peer and knight,<BR>
Seeing on every side the people fly,<BR>
Rides to the gates, with squadron duly dight,<BR>
And at his hest the portals open fly.<BR>
Meanwhile Sir Gryphon, having put to flight<BR>
The weak and worthless rabble far and nigh,<BR>
The scorned arms (to keep him from that train),<BR>
Such as they were, took up and donned again.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXI.</TD><TD>
And nigh a temple strongly walled, and round<BR>
Whose base a moat for its protection goes,<BR>
Upon a little bridge takes up his ground,<BR>
That him his enemies may not enclose.<BR>
Lo! loudly shouting, and with threatening sound,<BR>
A mighty squadron through the gateway flows.<BR>
The valiant Gryphon changes not his place,<BR>
And shows how small his fear by act and face.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXII.</TD><TD>
But when, approaching near, he saw the band,<BR>
He sallied forth to meet them by the way;<BR>
And wielding still his sword in either hand,<BR>
Made cruel havoc in the close array.<BR>
Then on the narrow bridge resumed his stand,<BR>
Nor there his hunters only held at bay:<BR>
Anew he sallied, and returned anew,<BR>
Aye leaving bloody signs when he withdrew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIII.</TD><TD>
Fore-stroke and back he deals, and on the ground<BR>
Horsemen and foot o&#8217;erthrows on every side:<BR>
This while the ample mob the knight surround,<BR>
And more and more the warfare rages wide.<BR>
At length Sir Gryphon fears he shall be drowned,<BR>
(So waxed their numbers) in the increasing tide;<BR>
And hurt in the left shoulder, through his mail,<BR>
And thigh, his wind as well begins to fail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIV.</TD><TD>
But Valour, who so oft befriends her own,<BR>
Makes him find grace in Norandino&#8217;s eyes;<BR>
Who, while alarmed, he hurries there, o&#8217;erthrown<BR>
So many men, such heaps of dead espies,<BR>
While he views wounds, which Hector&#8217;s hand alone<BR>
He weens could deal,&#8212;to him all testifies<BR>
That he had put an undeserved shame<BR>
Upon a cavalier of mighty name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXV.</TD><TD>
Next seeing him more near, whose falchion&#8217;s sweep<BR>
Had dealt such deaths amid his chivalry,<BR>
And raised about himself that horrid heap,<BR>
And stained the water with that bloody dye,<BR>
He thought that he beheld Horatius keep,<BR>
Singly, the bridge against all Tuscany;<BR>
And vext, and anxious to remove the stain,<BR>
Recalled his men, and that with little pain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVI.</TD><TD>
And, lifting his bare hand, in sign affied,<BR>
From ancient times, of treaty and of truce,<BR>
Repenting him, he to Sir Gryphon cried,<BR>
&#8220;It grieves me sorely, and I cannot choose<BR>
But own my sin: let counsels which misguide,<BR>
And my own little wit, such fault excuse.<BR>
What by the vilest knight I thought to do,<BR>
I to the best on earth have done in you.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;And though the bitter injuries and shame<BR>
That have to thee through ignorance been done,<BR>
Are equalled, and all cancelled by thy fame,<BR>
And merged, in truth, in glory thou hast won;<BR>
Whatever satisfaction thou canst claim,<BR>
Within my power or knowledge, count upon,<BR>
When I know how atonement may be made,<BR>
By city, castle, or by money paid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Demand of me this kingdom&#8217;s moiety,<BR>
And from this day thou its possessor art,<BR>
Since not alone thy worth deserves this fee,<BR>
But merits, I with this should give my heart;<BR>
Then, pledge of faith and lasting love, to me,<BR>
In the meanwhile, thy friendly hand impart.&#8221;<BR>
So saying, from his horse the king descended,<BR>
And towards Gryphon his right-hand extended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXIX.</TD><TD>
When he beheld the monarch&#8217;s altered cheer,<BR>
Who bent to clasp his neck, towards him paced,<BR>
His sword and rancour laid aside, the peer<BR>
Him humbly underneath the hips embraced.<BR>
King Norandine, who saw the sanguine smear<BR>
Of his two wounds, bade seek a leech in haste;<BR>
And bade them softly with the knight resort<BR>
Towards the town, and lodge him in his court.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXX.</TD><TD>
Here, wounded, he remained some days before<BR>
He could bear arms: but him, in the design<BR>
Of seeking out Sir Aquilant once more,<BR>
And good Astolpho, left in Palestine,<BR>
I quit; they vainly did his path explore,<BR>
After Sir Gryphon left the holy shrine,<BR>
Through Solyma in every place of note,<BR>
And many, from the Holy Land remote.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXI.</TD><TD>
One and the other are alike to seek<BR>
In the inquiry where the knight may use;<BR>
But they encounter with the pilgrim-Greek,<BR>
Who of false Origilla gives them news;<BR>
Relating, as of her he haps to speak,<BR>
That towards Antioch she her way pursues,<BR>
By a new leman of that city charmed,<BR>
Who her with fierce and sudden flame had warmed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXII.</TD><TD>
Aquilant asked him, if he had possest<BR>
Sir Gryphon of the news to them conveyed,<BR>
Who, hearing that he had, surmised the rest,&#8212;<BR>
Where he was gone, and by what motive swayed:<BR>
He followed Origille, was manifest,<BR>
And had in quest of her for Antioch made,<BR>
To take her from his rival, and with view<BR>
On him some memorable scathe to do.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIII.</TD><TD>
Aquilant brooked not Gryphon such a feat,<BR>
Without him, and alone, should thus assay,<BR>
And took his armour and pursued his beat;<BR>
But first besought the duke he would delay<BR>
To visit France and his paternal seat,<BR>
Till he from Antioch measured back his way.<BR>
At Joppa he embarks, who deems by sea<BR>
The better and securer way to be.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIV.</TD><TD>
From the south-east up-sprung so strong a breeze,<BR>
And which for Gryphon&#8217;s galley blew so right,<BR>
That the third day he Tyre&#8217;s famed city sees,<BR>
And lesser Joppa quick succeeds to sight.<BR>
By Zibellotto and Baruti flees,<BR>
(Cyprus to larboard left) the galley light;<BR>
From Tripoli to Tortosa shapes her way,<BR>
And so to Lizza and Lajazzo&#8217;s bay.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXV.</TD><TD>
From thence, towards the east the pilot veered<BR>
Her ready tiller, prompt his course to scan;<BR>
And straightway for the wide Orontes steered,<BR>
And watched his time, and for the harbour ran.<BR>
Aquilant, when his bark the margin neared,<BR>
Bade lower the bridge, and issued, horse and man,<BR>
It armour, and along the river wended,<BR>
Up-stream, till he his way at Antioch ended.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVI.</TD><TD>
To inform himself of that Martano bent;<BR>
And heard that he to Antioch was addrest,<BR>
With Origilla, where a tournament<BR>
Was to be solemnized by royal hest.<BR>
To track whom Aquilant was so intent,<BR>
Assured that Gryphon had pursued his quest,<BR>
He Antioch left again that very day,<BR>
But not by sea again would take his way.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVII.</TD><TD>
He towards Lidia and Larissa goes,<BR>
&#8212;At rich Aleppo makes a longer stay.<BR>
God, to make plain that he, even here, bestows<BR>
On evil and on good their fitting pay,<BR>
At a league&#8217;s distance from Mamuga, throws<BR>
Martano in the avenging brother&#8217;s way,<BR>
Martano travelling with the tourney&#8217;s prize,<BR>
Displayed before his horse in showy wise.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Sir Aquilant believed, at the first show,<BR>
His brother he in vile Martano spied.<BR>
For arms and vest, more white than virgin snow,<BR>
The coward in the warrior&#8217;s sight belied,<BR>
And sprang towards him, with that joyful &#8220;Oh!&#8221;<BR>
By which delight is ever signified;<BR>
But changed his look and tone, when, nearer brought<BR>
He sees that he is not the wight he sought:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXIX.</TD><TD>
And through that evil woman&#8217;s treachery,<BR>
Deemed Gryphon murdered by the cavalier;<BR>
And, &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;thou, who must be<BR>
Traitor and thief&#8212;both written in thy cheer&#8212;<BR>
Whence are these arms? and wherefore do I thee<BR>
View on the courser of my brother dear?<BR>
Say is my brother slaughtered or alive?<BR>
How didst thou him of horse and arms deprive?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXX.</TD><TD>
When Origille hears him, in affright<BR>
She turns her palfrey, and for flight prepares:<BR>
But Aquilant, more quick, in her despite,<BR>
Arrests the traitress, ere she further fares.<BR>
At the loud threats of that all furious knight,<BR>
By whom he so was taken unawares,<BR>
Martan&#8217; turns pale and trembles like a leaf,<BR>
Nor how to act or answer knows the thief.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXI.</TD><TD>
Aquilant thundered still, and, to his dread,<BR>
A falchion, pointed at his gullet, shewed,<BR>
And swore with angry menaces, the head<BR>
From him and Origille should be hewed,<BR>
Save in all points the very truth be said.<BR>
Awhile on this ill-starred Martano chewed,<BR>
Revolving still what pretext he might try<BR>
To lessen his grave fault, then made reply:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Know, sir, you see my sister in this dame,<BR>
And one of good and virtuous parents born,<BR>
Though she has lately led a life of shame,<BR>
And been by Gryphon foully brought to scorn;<BR>
And, for I loathed such blot upon our name,<BR>
Yet weened that she could ill by force be torn<BR>
From such a puissant wight, I laid a scheme<BR>
Her by address and cunning to redeem.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;With her I planned the means, who in her breast<BR>
Nursed the desire a better life to prove,<BR>
That she, when Gryphon was retired to rest,<BR>
In silence from the warrior should remove.<BR>
This done: lest he should follow on our quest,<BR>
And so undo the web we vainly wove,<BR>
Him we deprived of horse and arm, and we<BR>
Are hither come together, as you see.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIV.</TD><TD>
His cunning might have proved of good avail,<BR>
For Aquilant believed him easily;<BR>
And, save in taking Gryphon&#8217;s horse and mail,<BR>
He to the knight had done no injury;<BR>
But that he wrought so high the specious tale,<BR>
As manifested plainly, &#8217;twas a lie.<BR>
In all &#8217;twas perfect, save that he the dame<BR>
Had for his sister vouched with whom he came.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXV.</TD><TD>
Aquilant had in Antioch chanced to know<BR>
She was his concubine,&#8212;well certified<BR>
Of this by many,&#8212;and in furious glow<BR>
Exclaimed; &#8220;Thou falsest robber, thou hast lied!&#8221;<BR>
And dealt, with that, the recreant such a blow,<BR>
He drove two grinders down his throat; then tied<BR>
(Not sought Martano with his foe to cope)<BR>
The caitiff&#8217;s arms behind him with a rope.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVI.</TD><TD>
And, though she for excuse tried many wiles,<BR>
Did thus as well by Origille untrue;<BR>
And till he reached Damascus&#8217; lofty piles,<BR>
Them by town, street, or farm, behind him drew:<BR>
And will a thousand times a thousand miles,<BR>
With sorrow and with suffering, drag the two,<BR>
Till he his brother find; who, at his pleasure,<BR>
May vengeance to the guilty couple measure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVII.</TD><TD>
Sir Aquilant made squires and beasts as well<BR>
Return with him, and to Damascus came;<BR>
And heard Renown, throughout the city, swell,<BR>
Plying her ample wings, Sir Gryphon&#8217;s name.<BR>
Here, great and little&#8212;every one, could tell<BR>
&#8217;Twas he that in the tourney won such fame,<BR>
And had, by one that ill deserved his trust,<BR>
Been cheated of the honours of the just.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Pointing him out to one another&#8217;s sight,<BR>
The hostile people all Martano bayed;<BR>
&#8220;And is not this (they cried) that ribald wight<BR>
Who in another&#8217;s spoils himself arrayed,<BR>
And who the valour of a sleeping knight,<BR>
With his own shame and infamy o&#8217;erlaid?<BR>
And this the woman of ungrateful mood,<BR>
Who aids the wicked and betrays the good?&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>LXXXIX.</TD><TD>
Others exclaimed, &#8220;How fittingly combined,<BR>
Marked with one stamp, and of one race are they!&#8221;<BR>
Some loudly cursed them, and some raved behind,<BR>
While others shouted, &#8220;Hang, burn, quarter, slay!&#8221;<BR>
The throng to view them prest, with fury blind,<BR>
And to the square before them made its way.<BR>
The monarch of the tidings was advised,<BR>
And these above another kingdom prized.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XC.</TD><TD>
Attended with few squires the Syrian king,<BR>
As then he chanced to be, came forth with speed,<BR>
And with Sir Aquilant encountering,<BR>
Who Gryphon had avenged with worthy deed,<BR>
Him honoured with fair cheer, and home would bring,<BR>
And in his palace lodged, as fitting meed;<BR>
Having the prisoned pair, with his consent,<BR>
First in the bottom of a turret pent.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCI.</TD><TD>
Thither they go, where Gryphon from his bed<BR>
Has not as yet, since he was wounded, stirred;<BR>
Who at his brother&#8217;s coming waxes red,<BR>
Surmising well he of his case has heard:<BR>
And after Aquilant his say had said,<BR>
And him somedeal reproached, the three conferred<BR>
As to what penance to the wicked two,<BR>
So fallen into their hands, was justly due.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCII.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Tis Aquilant&#8217;s, &#8217;tis Norandino&#8217;s will<BR>
A thousand tortures shall their guerdon be:<BR>
But Gryphon, who the dame alone can ill<BR>
Excuse, entreats for both impunity;<BR>
And many matters urges with much skill.<BR>
But well is answered: and &#8217;tis ruled, to flea<BR>
Martano&#8217;s body with the hangman&#8217;s scourge,<BR>
And only short of death his penance urge.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIII.</TD><TD>
Bound is the wretch, but not &#8217;mid grass and flower,<BR>
Whose limbs beneath the hangman&#8217;s lashes burn<BR>
All the next morn: they prison in the tower<BR>
Origille, till Lucina shall return;<BR>
To whom the counselling lords reserve the power<BR>
To speak the woman&#8217;s sentence, mild or stern.<BR>
Harboured, till Gryphon can bear arms, at court,<BR>
Aquilant fleets the time in fair disport.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIV.</TD><TD>
The valiant Norandino could not choose<BR>
(Made by such error temperate and wise),<BR>
But full of penitence and sorrow, muse,<BR>
With downcast spirit, and in mournful guise,<BR>
On having bid his men a knight misuse,<BR>
Whom all should worthily reward and prize;<BR>
So that he, night and morning, in his thought,<BR>
How to content the injured warrior sought.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCV.</TD><TD>
And he determined, in the public sight<BR>
O&#8217; the city, guilty of that injury,<BR>
With all such honour as to perfect knight<BR>
Could by a puissant monarch rendered be,<BR>
Him with the glorious guerdon to requite,<BR>
Which had been ravished by such treachery:<BR>
And hence, within a month, proclaimed the intent<BR>
To hold another solemn tournament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVI.</TD><TD>
For which he made what stately preparation<BR>
Was possible to make by sceptered king.<BR>
Hence Fame divulged the royal proclamation<BR>
Throughout all Syria&#8217;s land, with nimble wing,<BR>
Phoenicia and Palestine; till the relation<BR>
Of this in good Astolpho&#8217;s ears did ring;<BR>
Who, with the lord who ruled that land in trust,<BR>
Resolved he would be present at the just.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVII.</TD><TD>
For a renowned and valiant cavalier<BR>
Has the true history vaunted, Sansonnet,<BR>
By Roland christened, Charles (I said), the peer<BR>
Over the Holy Land as ruler set:<BR>
He with the duke takes up his load, to steer<BR>
Thither, where Rumour speaks the champions met.<BR>
So that his ears, on all sides in the journey,<BR>
Are filled with tidings of Damascus&#8217; tourney.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCVIII.</TD><TD>
Thither the twain their way those countries through,<BR>
By easy stages and by slow, addrest,<BR>
That fresh upon the day of joust the two<BR>
Might in Damascus-town set up their rest.<BR>
When at the meeting of cross-ways they view<BR>
A person, who, in movement and in vest,<BR>
Appears to be a man, but is a maid;<BR>
And marvellously fierce, in martial raid.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>XCIX.</TD><TD>
Marphisa was the warlike virgin&#8217;s name,<BR>
And such her worth, she oft with naked brand<BR>
Had pressed Orlando sore in martial game,<BR>
And him who had Mount Alban in command;<BR>
And ever, night and day, the armed dame<BR>
Scowered, here and there, by hill and plain, the land;<BR>
Hoping with errant cavalier to meet,<BR>
And win immortal fame by glorious feat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>C.</TD><TD>
When Sansonnetto and the English knight<BR>
She sees approaching her, in warlike weed,<BR>
Who seem two valiant warriors in her sight,<BR>
As of large bone, and nerved for doughty deed,<BR>
On them she fain would prove her martial might,<BR>
And to defy the pair has moved her steed.<BR>
When, eyeing the two warriors, now more near,<BR>
Marphisa recognized the duke and peer.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CI.</TD><TD>
His pleasing ways she did in mind retrace,<BR>
When arms in far Cat&agrave;y with her he bore<BR>
Called him by name, nor would in iron case;<BR>
Retain her hand, upraised the casque she wore,<BR>
And him, advanced, to meet with glad embrace,<BR>
Though, of all living dames and those of yore,<BR>
The proudest, she; nor with less courteous mien<BR>
The paladin salutes the martial queen.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CII.</TD><TD>
They questioned one another of their way;<BR>
And when the duke has said (who first replied)<BR>
That he Damascus seeks, where to assay<BR>
Their virtuous deeds, all knights of valour tried<BR>
The Syrian king invites, in martial play,&#8212;<BR>
The bold Marphisa, at his hearing cried,<BR>
(Ever to prove her warlike prowess bent)<BR>
&#8220;I will be with you at this tournament.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIII.</TD><TD>
To have such a comrade either cavalier<BR>
Is much rejoiced. They to Damascus go,<BR>
And in a suburb, of the city clear,<BR>
Are lodged, upon the day before the show;<BR>
And, till her aged lover, once so dear,<BR>
Aurora roused, their humble roof below,<BR>
In greater ease the weary warriors rested<BR>
Than had they been in costly palace guested.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIV.</TD><TD>
And when the clear and lucid sun again<BR>
Its shining glories all abroad had spread,<BR>
The beauteous lady armed, and warriors twain,<BR>
Having first couriers to the city sped,<BR>
Who, when &#8217;twas time, reported to the train,<BR>
That, to see truncheons split in contest dread,<BR>
King Norandine had come into the square<BR>
In which the cruel games appointed were.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CV.</TD><TD>
Straight to the city ride the martial band,<BR>
And, through the high-street, to the crowded place;<BR>
Where, waiting for the royal signal, stand,<BR>
Ranged here and there, the knights of gentle race.<BR>
The guerdons destined to the conqueror&#8217;s hand,<BR>
In that day&#8217;s tourney, were a tuck and mace<BR>
Richly adorned, and, with them, such a steed<BR>
As to the winning lord were fitting meed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVI.</TD><TD>
Norandine, sure that, in the martial game,<BR>
Both prizes destined for the conquering knight,<BR>
As well as one and the other tourney&#8217;s fame,<BR>
Must be obtained by Gryphon, named the white,<BR>
To give him all that valiant man could claim,<BR>
Nor could he give the warrior less, with right,<BR>
The armour, guerdon of this final course<BR>
Placed with the tuck and mace and noble horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVII.</TD><TD>
The arms which in the former joust the due<BR>
Of valiant Gryphon were, who all had gained,<BR>
(With evil profit, by the wretch untrue,<BR>
Martan&#8217; usurped, who Gryphon&#8217;s bearing feigned)<BR>
To be hung up on high in public view<BR>
With the rich-flourished tuck, the king ordained,<BR>
And fastened at the saddle of the steed<BR>
The mace, that Gryphon might win either meed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CVIII.</TD><TD>
But from effecting what he had intended<BR>
He was prevented by the warlike maid;<BR>
Who late into the crowded square had wended,<BR>
With Sansonnet and England&#8217;s duke arrayed,<BR>
Seeing the arms of which I spoke suspended,<BR>
She straight agnized the harness she surveyed,<BR>
Once hers, and dear to her; as matters are<BR>
Esteemed by us as excellent and rare;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CIX.</TD><TD>
Though, as a hindrance, she upon the road<BR>
Had left the arms, when, to retrieve her sword,<BR>
She from her shoulders slipt the ponderous load,<BR>
And chased Brunello, worthy of the cord.<BR>
More to relate were labour ill bestowed,<BR>
I deem, nor further of the tale record.<BR>
Enough for me, by you &#8217;tis understood,<BR>
How here she found anew her armour good.</TD></TR>

You shall take with you, when by manifest<BR>
And certain tokens they by her were known,<BR>
She, for no earthly thing, the iron vest<BR>
And weapons for a day would have foregone.<BR>
She thinks not if this mode or that be best<BR>
To have them, anxious to regain her own;<BR>
But t&#8217;wards the arms with hand extended hies,<BR>
And without more regard takes down the prize.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXI.</TD><TD>
And throwing some on earth, it chanced that more<BR>
Than was her own she in her hurry took.<BR>
The Syrian king, who was offended sore,<BR>
Raised war against her with a single look.<BR>
For ill the wrong his angered people bore,<BR>
And, to avenge him, lance and falchion shook;<BR>
Remembering not, on other day, how dear<BR>
They paid for scathing errant cavalier.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXII.</TD><TD>
No wishful child more joyfully, &#8217;mid all<BR>
The flowers of spring-tide, yellow, blue, and red,<BR>
Finds itself, nor at concert or at ball<BR>
Dame beauteous and adorned, than &#8217;mid the tread<BR>
Of warlike steeds, and din of arms, and fall<BR>
Of darts, and push of spears.&#8212;where blood is shed,<BR>
And death is dealt, in the tumultuous throng,&#8212;<BR>
SHE finds herself beyond all credence strong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIII.</TD><TD>
She spurred her courser, and with lance in rest,<BR>
Imperious at the foolish rabble made,<BR>
And&#8212;through the neck impaled or through the breast,&#8212;<BR>
Some pierced, some prostrate at the encounter layed.<BR>
Next this or that she with the falchion prest;<BR>
The head from one she severed with the blade,<BR>
And from that other cleft: another sank,<BR>
Short of right arm or left, or pierced in flank.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIV.</TD><TD>
Bold Sansonnetto and Astolpho near,<BR>
Who had, with her, their limbs in harness dight,<BR>
Though they for other end in arms appear,<BR>
Seeing the maid and crowd engaged in fight,<BR>
First lower the helmet&#8217;s vizor, next the spear,<BR>
And with their lances charge the mob outright:<BR>
Then bare their falchions, and, amid the crew,<BR>
A passage with the trenchant weapons hew.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXV.</TD><TD>
The errant cavaliers who to that stage,<BR>
To joust, from different lands had made resort,<BR>
Seeing them warfare with such fury wage,<BR>
And into mourning changed the expected sport,<BR>
Because all knew not what had moved the rage<BR>
Of the infuriate people in that sort,<BR>
Nor what the insult offered to the king,<BR>
Suspended stood in doubt and wondering.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVI.</TD><TD>
Of these, some will the crowded rabble&#8217;s band<BR>
(Too late repentant of the feat) befriend:<BR>
Those, favouring not the natives of the land<BR>
More than the foreigners, to part them wend.<BR>
Others more wary, with their reins in hand,<BR>
Sit watching how the mischief is to end.<BR>
Gryphon and Aquilant are of the throng<BR>
Which hurry forward to avenge the wrong.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVII.</TD><TD>
The pair of warlike brethren witnessing<BR>
The monarch&#8217;s drunken eyes with venom fraught,<BR>
And having heard from many in the ring<BR>
The occasion which the furious strife had wrought,<BR>
Himself no whit less injured than the king<BR>
Of Syria&#8217;s land, offended Gryphon thought.<BR>
Each knight, in haste, supplied himself with spear,<BR>
And thundering vengeance drove in full career.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXVIII.</TD><TD>
On Rabican, pricked forth before his hand,<BR>
Valiant Astolpho, from the other bound,<BR>
With the enchanted lance of gold in hand,<BR>
Which at the first encounter bore to ground<BR>
What knights he smote with it; and on the sand<BR>
Laid Gryphon first; next Aquilant he found,<BR>
And scarcely touched the border of his shield,<BR>
Ere he reversed the warrior on the field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXIX.</TD><TD>
From lofty saddle Sansonnet o&#8217;erthrew,<BR>
Famous for price and prowess, many a knight.<BR>
To the outlet of the square the mob withdrew;<BR>
The monarch raged with anger and despite.<BR>
Meanwhile, of the first cuirass and the new<BR>
Possest, as well as either helmet bright,<BR>
Marphisa, when she all in flight discerned,<BR>
Conqueror towards her suburb-inn returned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXX.</TD><TD>
Sansonnet and Astolpho are not slow<BR>
In following t&#8217;wards the gate the martial maid,<BR>
(The mob dividing all to let them go)<BR>
And halt when they have reached the barricade.<BR>
Gryphon and Aquilant, who saw with woe<BR>
Themselves on earth at one encounter laid,<BR>
Their drooping heads, opprest with shame, decline,<BR>
Nor dare appear before King Norandine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXI.</TD><TD>
Seizing their steeds and mounting, either son<BR>
Of Oliver to seek their foemen went:<BR>
With many of his vassals too is gone<BR>
The king; on death or vengeance all intent.<BR>
The foolish rabble cry, &#8220;Lay on, lay on.&#8221;<BR>
And stand at distance and await the event.<BR>
Gryphon arrived where the three friends had gained<BR>
A bridge, and facing round the post maintained.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXII.</TD><TD>
He, at the first approach, Astolpho knew,<BR>
For still the same device had been his wear,<BR>
Even from the day he charmed Orrilo slew,<BR>
His horse, his arms the same: him not with care<BR>
Sir Gryphon had remarked, nor stedfast view,<BR>
When late he jousted with him in the square:<BR>
He knows him here and greets; next prays him show<BR>
Who the companions are that with him go;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIII.</TD><TD>
And why they had those arms, without the fear<BR>
Of Syria&#8217;s king, pulled down, and to his slight.<BR>
Of his champions England&#8217;s cavalier,<BR>
Sir Gryphon courteously informed aright.<BR>
But little of those arms, pursued the peer,<BR>
He knew, which were the occasion of the fight;<BR>
But (for he thither with Marphisa came<BR>
And Sansonnet) had armed to aid the dame.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIV.</TD><TD>
While he and Gryphon stood in colloquy,<BR>
Aquilant came, and knew Astolpho good,<BR>
Whom he heard speaking with his brother nigh,<BR>
And, though of evil purpose, changed his mood.<BR>
Of Norandine&#8217;s trooped many, these to spy;<BR>
But came not nigh the warriors where they stood:<BR>
And seeing them in conference, stood clear,<BR>
Listening, in silence, and intent to hear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXV.</TD><TD>
Some one who hears Marphisa hold is there,<BR>
Famed, through the world, for matchless bravery,<BR>
His courser turns, and bids the king have care,<BR>
Save he would lose his Syrian chivalry,<BR>
To snatch his court, before all slaughtered are,<BR>
From the hand of Death and of Tisiphone:<BR>
For that &#8217;twas verily Marphisa, who<BR>
Had borne away the arms in public view.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVI.</TD><TD>
As Norandine is told that name of dread,<BR>
Through the Levant so feared on every side,<BR>
Whose mention made the hair on many a head<BR>
Bristle, though she was often distant wide.<BR>
He fears the ill may happen which is said,<BR>
Unless against the mischief he provide;<BR>
And hence his meiny, who have changed their ire<BR>
Already into fear, he bids retire.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVII.</TD><TD>
The sons of Oliver, on the other hand,<BR>
With Sansonnetto and the English knight,<BR>
So supplicate Marphisa, she her brand<BR>
Puts up, and terminates the cruel fight;<BR>
And to the monarch next, amid his brand,<BR>
Cries, proudly, &#8220;Sir, I know not by what right<BR>
Thou wouldst this armour, not thine own, present<BR>
To him who conquers in thy tournament.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXVIII.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Mine are these arms, which I, upon a day,<BR>
Left on the road which leads from Armeny,<BR>
Because, parforce a-foot, I sought to stay<BR>
A robber, who had sore offended me.<BR>
The truth of this my ensign may display.<BR>
Which here is seen, if it be known to thee.&#8221;<BR>
With that she on the plate which sheathed the breast<BR>
(Cleft in three places) showed a crown imprest.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;To me this an Armenian merchant gave,<BR>
&#8217;Tis true,&#8221; replied the king, &#8220;some days ago;<BR>
And had you raised your voice, the arms to crave,<BR>
You should have had them, whether yours or no.<BR>
For, notwithstanding I to Gryphon gave<BR>
The armour, I so well his nature know,<BR>
He freely would resign the gift he earned,<BR>
That it by me to you might be returned.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Your allegation needs not to persuade<BR>
These arms are yours&#8212;that they your impress bear;<BR>
Your word suffices me, by me more weighed<BR>
Than all that other witness could declare.<BR>
To grant them yours is but a tribute paid<BR>
To Virtue, worthy better prize to wear.<BR>
Now have the arms, and let us make accord;<BR>
And let some fairer gift the knight reward.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXI.</TD><TD>
Gryphon, who little had those arms at heart,<BR>
But much to satisfy the king was bent,<BR>
Replied: &#8220;You recompense enough impart,<BR>
Teaching me how your wishes to content.&#8221;<BR>
&#8212;&#8220;Here is my honour all at sake,&#8221; apart,<BR>
&#8220;Meseemeth,&#8221; said Marphisa, and forewent<BR>
Her claim for Gryphon&#8217;s sake, with courteous cheer;<BR>
And, as his gift, in fine received the gear.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXII.</TD><TD>
To the city, their rejoicings to renew,<BR>
In love and peace they measured back their way.<BR>
Next came the joust, of which the honour due,<BR>
And prize was Sansonnet&#8217;s; since from the fray<BR>
Abstained Astolpho and the brethren two,<BR>
And bold Marphisa, best of that array,<BR>
Like faithful friends and good companions; fain<BR>
That Sansonnet the tourney&#8217;s meed should gain.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIII.</TD><TD>
Eight days or ten in joy and triumph dwell<BR>
The knights with Norandine; but with such strong<BR>
Desire of France the warriors&#8217; bosoms swell,<BR>
Which will not let them thence be absent long,<BR>
They take their leave. Marphisa, who as well<BR>
Thither would go, departs the troop among.<BR>
Marphisa had long time, with sword and lance,<BR>
Desired to prove the paladins of France;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIV.</TD><TD>
And make experiment, if they indeed<BR>
Such worth as is by Rumour voiced display.<BR>
Sansonnet leaves another, in his stead,<BR>
The city of Jerusalem to sway,<BR>
And now these five, in chosen squadron speed,<BR>
Who have few peers in prowess, on their way.<BR>
Dismist by Norandine, to Tripoli<BR>
They wend, and to the neighbouring haven hie.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXV.</TD><TD>
And there a carack find, about to steer<BR>
For western countries, taking in her store:<BR>
They, with the patron, for themselves and gear,<BR>
And horses, make accord; a seaman hoar<BR>
Of Luna he: the heavens, on all sides clear,<BR>
Vouch many days&#8217; fair weather. From the shore<BR>
They loose, with sky serene, and every sail<BR>
Of the yare vessel stretched by favouring gale.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVI.</TD><TD>
The island of the amorous deity<BR>
Breathed upon them an air, in her first port,<BR>
Which not alone to man does injury,<BR>
But moulders iron, and here life is short;<BR>
&#8212;A marsh the cause,&#8212;and Nature certainly<BR>
Wrongs Famagosta, poisoning, in such sort,<BR>
That city with Constantia&#8217;s fen malign,<BR>
To all the rest of Cyprus so benign.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVII.</TD><TD>
The noxious scents that from the marish spring,<BR>
After short sojourn there, compel their flight.<BR>
The barque to a south-easter every wing<BR>
Extends, and circles Cyprus to the right,<BR>
Makes Paphos&#8217; island next, and, anchoring,<BR>
The crew and warriors on the beach alight;<BR>
Those to ship merchandize, and these, at leisure,<BR>
To view the laughing land of Love and Pleasure.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Inland six miles or seven from thence, a way<BR>
Scales, with an easy rise, a pleasant hill;<BR>
Which myrtle, orange, cedar-tree, and bay,<BR>
And other perfumed plants by thousands fill;<BR>
Thyme, marjoram, crocus, rose, and lily gay<BR>
From odoriferous leaf such sweets distill,<BR>
That they who sail the sea the fragrance bland,<BR>
Scent in each genial gale which blows from land.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXXXIX.</TD><TD>
A fruitful rill, by limpid fountain fed,<BR>
Waters, all round about, the fertile space.<BR>
The land of Venus truly may be said<BR>
That passing joyous and delightful place:<BR>
For every maid and wife, who there is bred,<BR>
Is through the world beside, unmatched in grace:<BR>
And Venus wills, till their last hour be tolled,<BR>
That Love should warm their bosoms, young and old.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXL.</TD><TD>
&#8217;Twas here they heard the same which they before<BR>
Of the orc and of Lucina, erst had heard<BR>
In Syria; how she to return once more<BR>
In Nicosia, to her lord prepared.<BR>
Thence (a fair wind now blowing from the shore)<BR>
His bark for sea the ready Patron cleared,<BR>
Hawled up his anchor, westward turned the head<BR>
Of the good ship, and all his canvas spread.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLI.</TD><TD>
To the north wind, which blew upon their right,<BR>
Stretching to seaward, they their sails untie:<BR>
When lo! a south-south-wester, which seemed light,<BR>
In the beginning, while the sun was high,<BR>
And afterwards increased in force t&#8217;wards night,<BR>
Raised up the sea against them mountains high;<BR>
With such dread flashes, and loud peals of thunder,<BR>
As Heaven, to swallow all in fire, would sunder.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLII.</TD><TD>
The clouds their gloomy veil above them strain,<BR>
Nor suffer sun or star to cheer the view.<BR>
Above the welkin roared, beneath the main;<BR>
On every side the wind and tempest grew;<BR>
Which, with sharp piercing cold and blinding rain,<BR>
Afflicted sore the miserable crew.<BR>
While aye descending night, with deeper shade,<BR>
The vext and fearful billows overlayed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIII.</TD><TD>
The sailors, in this war of wind and flood,<BR>
Were prompt to manifest their vaunted art.<BR>
One blowing through the shrilling whistle stood,<BR>
And with the signal taught the rest their part.<BR>
One clears the best bower anchor: one is good<BR>
To lower, this other to hawl home or start<BR>
The braces; one from deck the lumber cast,<BR>
And this secured the tiller, that the mast.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIV.</TD><TD>
The cruel wind increased throughout the night,<BR>
Which grew more dismal and more dark than hell.<BR>
The wary Patron stood to sea outright,<BR>
Where he believed less broken was the swell;<BR>
And turned his prow to meet, with ready sleight,<BR>
The buffets of the dreadful waves which fell;<BR>
Never without some hope, that at day-break<BR>
The storm might lull, or else its fury slake.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLV.</TD><TD>
It lulls not, nor its fury slakes, but grown<BR>
Wilder, shows worse by day,&#8212;if this be day,<BR>
Which but by reckoning of the hours is known,<BR>
And not by any cheering light or ray.<BR>
Now, with more fear (his weaker hope o&#8217;erthrown).<BR>
The sorrowing Patron to the wind gives way,<BR>
He veers his barque before the cruel gale,<BR>
And scowers the foaming sea with humble sail.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLVI.</TD><TD>
While Fortune on the sea annoys this crew,<BR>
She grants those others small repose by land,<BR>
Those left in France, who one another slew,&#8212;<BR>
The men of England and the paynim band.<BR>
These bold Rinaldo broke and overthrew;<BR>
Nor troops nor banners spread before him stand:<BR>
I speak of him, who his Bayardo fleet<BR>
Had spurred the gallant Dardinel to meet.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLVII.</TD><TD>
The shield, of which Almontes&#8217; son was vain,<BR>
That of the quarters, good Rinaldo spied;<BR>
And deemed him bold, and of a valiant strain,<BR>
Who with Orlando&#8217;s ensign dared to ride.<BR>
Approaching nearer, this appeared more plain,<BR>
When heaps of slaughtered men he round him eyed.<BR>
&#8220;Better it were,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;to overthrow<BR>
This evil plant, before it shoot and grow.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLVIII.</TD><TD>
Each to retreat betook him, where the peer<BR>
His face directed, and large passage made.<BR>
Nor less the Saracens than faithful, clear<BR>
The way, so reverenced is Fusberta&#8217;s blade.<BR>
Save Dardinel, Mount Alban&#8217;s cavalier,<BR>
Saw none, nor he to chase his prey delayed.<BR>
To whom, &#8220;He cast upon thee mickle care,<BR>
Poor child, who of that buckler left thee heir.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXLIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;I seek thee out to prove (if thou attend<BR>
My coming) how thou keep&#8217;st the red and white,<BR>
For thou, save this from me thou canst defend,<BR>
Canst ill defend it from Orlando&#8217;s might.&#8221;<BR>
To him the king: &#8220;Now clearly comprehend,<BR>
I what I bear, as well defend in fight;<BR>
And I more honour hope than trouble dread<BR>
From my paternal quartering, white and red.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CL.</TD><TD>
&#8220;Have thou no hope to make me fly, or yield<BR>
To thee my quarters, though a child I be;<BR>
My life shalt thou take from me, if my shield;<BR>
But I, in God, well hope the contrary.<BR>
&#8212;This as it may!&#8212;shall none, in fighting field,<BR>
Say that I ever shamed my ancestry.&#8221;<BR>
So said, and grasping in his hand the sword,<BR>
The youthful king assailed Mount Alban&#8217;s lord.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLI.</TD><TD>
Upon all parts, a freezing fear goes through<BR>
The heart blood of each trembling paynim nigh,<BR>
When they amazed the fierce Rinaldo view;<BR>
Who charged the monarch with such enmity,<BR>
As might a lion, which a bullock, new<BR>
To stings of love, should in a meadow spy.<BR>
The Moor smote first, but fruitless was his task,<BR>
Who beat in vain upon Mambrino&#8217;s casque.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLII.</TD><TD>
Rinaldo smiled, and said: &#8220;I&#8217;d have thee know<BR>
If I am better skilled to find the vein.&#8221;<BR>
He spurs, and lets with that the bridle go,<BR>
And a thrust pushes with such might and main,<BR>
&#8212;A thrust against the bosom of his foe,<BR>
That at his back the blade appears again.<BR>
Forth issued blood and soul, and from his sell<BR>
Lifeless and cold the reeling body fell.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLIII.</TD><TD>
As languishes the flower of purple hue,<BR>
Which levelled by the passing ploughshare lies;<BR>
Or as the poppy, overcharged with dew,<BR>
In garden droops its head in piteous wise:<BR>
From life the leader of Zumara&#8217;s crew<BR>
So past, his visage losing all its dyes;<BR>
So passed from life; and perished with their king,<BR>
The heart and hope of all his following.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLIV.</TD><TD>
As waters will sometime their course delay,<BR>
Stagnant, and penned in pool by human skill,<BR>
Which, when the opposing dyke is broke away,<BR>
Fall, and with mighty noise the country fill:<BR>
&#8217;Twas so the Africans, who had some stay,<BR>
While Dardinello valour did instil,<BR>
Fled here and there, dismayed on every side,<BR>
When they him hurtling form his sell descried.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLV.</TD><TD>
Letting the flyers fly, of those who stand<BR>
Firm in their place, Rinaldo breaks the array;<BR>
Ariodantes kills on every hand;<BR>
Who ranks well nigh Rinaldo on that day.<BR>
These Leonetto&#8217;s, those Zerbino&#8217;s brand<BR>
O&#8217;erturns, all rivals in the glorious fray.<BR>
Well Charles and Oliver their parts have done,<BR>
Turpin and Ogier, Guido and Salomon.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLVI.</TD><TD>
In peril were the Moors, that none again<BR>
Should visit Heatheness, that day opprest:<BR>
But that the wise and wary king of Spain,<BR>
Gathered, and from the field bore off the rest:<BR>
To sit down with his loss he better gain<BR>
Esteemed, that here to hazard purse and vest:<BR>
Better some remnant of the host to save,<BR>
Than bid whole squadrons stand and find a grave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLVII.</TD><TD>
He bids forthwith the Moorish ensigns be<BR>
Borne to the camp, which fosse and rampart span.<BR>
With the bold monarch of Andology,<BR>
The valiant Portuguese, and Stordilan.<BR>
He sends to pray the king of Barbary,<BR>
To endeavour to retire, as best be can;<BR>
Who will no little praise that day deserve,<BR>
If he his person and his place preserve.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLVIII.</TD><TD>
That king, who deemed himself in desperate case,<BR>
Nor ever more Biserta hoped to see;<BR>
For, with so horrible and foul a face<BR>
He never Fortune had beheld, with glee<BR>
Heard that Marsilius had contrived to place<BR>
Part of his host in full security;<BR>
And faced about his banners and bade beat<BR>
Throughout his broken squadrons a retreat.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLIX.</TD><TD>
But the best portion neither signal knew,<BR>
Nor listened to the drum or trumpet&#8217;s sound.<BR>
So scared, so crowded is the wretched crew,<BR>
That many in Seine&#8217;s neighbouring stream are drowned,<BR>
Agramant, who would form the band anew,<BR>
(With him Sobrino) scowers the squadrons round;<BR>
And with them every leader good combines<BR>
To bring the routed host within their lines.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLX.</TD><TD>
But nought by sovereign or Sobrino done,<BR>
Who, toiling, them with prayer or menace stirred,<BR>
To march, where their ill-followed flags are gone.<BR>
Can bring (I say not all) not even a third.<BR>
Slaughtered or put to flight are two for one<BR>
Who &#8217;scapes,&#8212;nor he unharmed: among that herd,<BR>
Wounded is this behind, and that before,<BR>
And wearied, one and all, and harassed sore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXI.</TD><TD>
And even within their lines, in panic sore,<BR>
They by the Christian bands are held in chase;<BR>
And of all needful matters little store<BR>
Was made there, for provisioning the place.<BR>
Charlemagne wisely by the lock before<BR>
Would grapple Fortune, when she turned her face,<BR>
But that dark night upon the field descended,<BR>
And hushed all earthly matters and suspended:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXII.</TD><TD>
By the Creator haply hastened, who<BR>
Was moved to pity for the works he made.<BR>
The blood in torrents ran the country through,<BR>
Flooding the roads: while on the champaign laid<BR>
Were eighty thousand of the paynim crew,<BR>
Cut off that day by the destroying blade:<BR>
Last trooped from caverns, at the midnight hour,<BR>
Villain and wolf to spoil them and devour.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXIII.</TD><TD>
King Charles returns no more within the town,<BR>
But camps without the city, opposite<BR>
The Moor&#8217;s cantonments, and bids up and down,<BR>
And round, high-piled and frequent watch-fires light.<BR>
The paynim fashions ditch and bastion,<BR>
Rampart and mine, and all things requisite;<BR>
Visits his outposts and his guards alarms,<BR>
Nor all the livelong night puts off his arms.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXIV.</TD><TD>
That livelong night the foes, throughout their tents,<BR>
As insecure and with their scathe deprest,<BR>
Poured tears, and uttered murmurs and laments;<BR>
But, as they could, their sounds of woe supprest.<BR>
One grief for slaughtered friends or kindred vents;<BR>
Some are by sorrows of their own distrest,<BR>
As wounded or as ill at ease; but more<BR>
Tremble at mischief which they deem in store.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXV.</TD><TD>
Two Moors amid the paynim army were,<BR>
From stock obscure in Ptolomita grown;<BR>
Of whom the story, an example rare<BR>
Of constant love, is worthy to be known:<BR>
Medoro and Cloridan were named the pair;<BR>
Who, whether Fortune pleased to smile or frown,<BR>
Served Dardinello with fidelity,<BR>
And late with him to France had crost the sea.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXVI.</TD><TD>
Of nimble frame and strong was Cloridane,<BR>
Throughout his life a follower of the chase.<BR>
A cheek of white, suffused with crimson grain,<BR>
Medoro had, in youth a pleasing grace.<BR>
Nor bound on that emprize, &#8217;mid all the train,<BR>
Was there a fairer or more jocund face.<BR>
Crisp hair he had of gold, and jet-black eyes:<BR>
And seemed an angel lighted from the skies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXVII.</TD><TD>
These two were posted on a rampart&#8217;s height,<BR>
With more to guard the encampment from surprise,<BR>
When &#8217;mid the equal intervals, at night,<BR>
Medoro gazed on heaven with sleepy eyes.<BR>
In all his talk, the stripling, woful wight,<BR>
Here cannot choose, but of his lord devise,<BR>
The royal Dardinel; and evermore<BR>
Him, left unhonoured on the field, deplore.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXVIII.</TD><TD>
Then, turning to his mate, cries: &#8220;Cloridane,<BR>
I cannot tell thee what a cause of woe<BR>
It is to me, my lord upon the plain<BR>
Should lie, unworthy food for wolf or crow!<BR>
Thinking how still to me he was humane,<BR>
Meseems, if in his honour I forego<BR>
This life of mine, for favours so immense<BR>
I shall but make a feeble recompense.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXIX.</TD><TD>
&#8220;That he may lack not sepulture, will I<BR>
Go forth, and seek him out among the slain;<BR>
And haply God may will that none shall spy<BR>
Where Charles&#8217;s camp lies hushed. Do thou remain;<BR>
That, if my death be written in the sky,<BR>
Thou may&#8217;st the deed be able to explain.<BR>
So that if Fortune foil so fear a feat,<BR>
The world, through Fame, my loving heart may weet.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXX.</TD><TD>
Amazed was Cloridan a child should show<BR>
Such heart, such love, and such fair loyalty;<BR>
And fain would make the youth his though forego,<BR>
Whom he held passing dear; but fruitlessly<BR>
Would move his stedfast purpose; for such woe<BR>
Will neither comforted nor altered be.<BR>
Medoro is disposed to meet his doom,<BR>
Or to enclose his master in the tomb.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXI.</TD><TD>
Seeing that nought would bend him, nought would move,<BR>
&#8220;I too will go,&#8221; was Cloridan&#8217;s reply,<BR>
&#8220;In such a glorious act myself will prove;<BR>
As well such famous death I cover, I:<BR>
What other thing is left me, here above,<BR>
Deprived of thee, Medoro mine? To die<BR>
With thee in arms is better, on the plain,<BR>
Than afterwards of grief, should&#8217;st thou be slain.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXII.</TD><TD>
And thus resolved, disposing in their place<BR>
Their guard&#8217;s relief, depart the youthful pair,<BR>
Leave fosse and palisade, and, in small space,<BR>
Are among ours, who watch with little care:<BR>
Who, for they little fear the paynim race,<BR>
Slumber with fires extinguished everywhere.<BR>
&#8217;Mid carriages and arms, they lie supine<BR>
Up to the eyes, immersed in sleep and wine.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXIII.</TD><TD>
A moment Cloridano stopt and cried:<BR>
&#8220;Not to be lost are opportunities.<BR>
This troop, by whom my master&#8217;s blood was shed,<BR>
Medoro, ought not I to sacrifice?<BR>
Do thou, lest any one this way be led,<BR>
Watch everywhere about, with ears and eyes.<BR>
For a wide way, amid the hostile horde,<BR>
I offer here to make thee with my sword.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXIV.</TD><TD>
So said he, and his talk cut quickly short,<BR>
Coming where learned Alpheus slumbered nigh;<BR>
Who had the year before sought Charles&#8217;s court,<BR>
In medicine, magic, and astrology<BR>
Well versed; but now in art found small-support,<BR>
Or rather found that it was all a lie.<BR>
He had foreseen, that he his long-drawn life<BR>
Should finish in the bosom of his wife.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXV.</TD><TD>
And now the Saracen with wary view<BR>
Has pierced his weasand with the pointed sword.<BR>
Four others he neat that Diviner, slew,<BR>
Nor gave the wretches time to say a word.<BR>
Sir Turpin in his story tells not who,<BR>
And Time had of their names effaced record.<BR>
Palidon of Moncalier next he speeds;<BR>
One who securely sleeps between two steeds.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXVI.</TD><TD>
Next came the warrior where, with limbs outspread,<BR>
Pillowed on barrel, lay the wretched Gryll:<BR>
This he had drained, and undisturbed by dread,<BR>
Hoped to enjoy a peaceful sleep and still.<BR>
The daring Saracen lopt off his head,<BR>
Blood issues from the tap-hole, with a rill<BR>
Of wine; and he, well drenched with many a can,<BR>
Dreams that he drinks, dispatched by Cloridan.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXVII.</TD><TD>
Next Gryll, Andropono and Conrad hight,<BR>
A Greek and German, at two thrusts he gored,<BR>
Who in the air had past large part of night<BR>
With dice and goblet; blest it at that board<BR>
They still had watched, till, clothed in amber light,<BR>
The radiant sun had traversed Indus&#8217; ford!<BR>
But mortals Destiny would set at nought<BR>
If every wight futurity were taught.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXVIII.</TD><TD>
As, in full fold, a lion long unfed,<BR>
Whom wasting famine had made lean and spare,<BR>
Devours and rends, and swallows, and lays dead<BR>
The feeble flock, which at his mercy are;<BR>
So, in their sleep, the cruel paynim bled<BR>
Our host, and made wide slaughter everywhere:<BR>
Nor blunted was the young Medoro&#8217;s sword,<BR>
But he disdained to smite the ignoble horde.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXIX.</TD><TD>
He to Labretto&#8217;s duke, leaving those dead,<BR>
Had come, who slumbered with a gentle mate,<BR>
Each clasping each so closely in their bed,<BR>
That air between them could not penetrate.<BR>
From both Medoro cleanly lopt the head.<BR>
Oh! blessed way of death! oh! happy fate!<BR>
For &#8217;tis my trust, that as their bodies, so<BR>
Their souls embracing to their bourne shall go.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXX.</TD><TD>
Malindo, with Andalico, he slew,<BR>
His brother, sons to the earl of Flanders they:<BR>
To whom has bearings (each to arms was new)<BR>
Charles had the lilies given; because that day<BR>
The monarch had beheld the valiant two<BR>
With crimsoned staves, returning from the fray;<BR>
And them with lands in Flanders vowed to glad;<BR>
And would, but that Medoro this forbad.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXI.</TD><TD>
Rearing the insidious blade, the pair are near<BR>
The place, where round King Charles&#8217; pavilion<BR>
Are tented warlike paladin and peer,<BR>
Guarding the side that each is camped upon.<BR>
When in good time the paynims backward steer,<BR>
And sheathe their swords, the impious slaughter done;<BR>
Deeming impossible, in such a number,<BR>
But they must light on one who does not slumber.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXII.</TD><TD>
And though they might escape well charged with prey,<BR>
To save themselves they think sufficient gain.<BR>
Thither by what he deems the safest way<BR>
(Medoro following him) went Cloridane<BR>
Where, in the field, &#8217;mid bow and falchion, lay,<BR>
And shield and spear, in pool of purple stain,<BR>
Wealthy and poor, the king and vassal&#8217;s corse,<BR>
And overthrown the rider and his horse.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXIII.</TD><TD>
The horrid mixture of the bodies there<BR>
Which heaped the plain where roved these comrades sworn,<BR>
Might well have rendered vain their faithful care<BR>
Amid the mighty piles, till break of morn,<BR>
Had not the moon, at young Medoro&#8217;s prayer,<BR>
Out of a gloomy cloud put forth her horn.<BR>
Medoro to the heavens upturns his eyes<BR>
Towards the moon, and thus devoutly cries:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXIV.</TD><TD>
&#8220;O holy goddess! whom our fathers well<BR>
Have styled as of a triple form, and who<BR>
Thy sovereign beauty dost in heaven, and hell,<BR>
And earth, in many forms reveal; and through<BR>
The greenwood holt, of beast and monster fell,<BR>
&#8212;A huntress bold&#8212;the flying steps pursue,<BR>
Show where my king, amid so many lies,<BR>
Who did, alive, thy holy studies prize.&#8221;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXV.</TD><TD>
At the youth&#8217;s prayer from parted cloud outshone<BR>
(Were it the work of faith or accident)<BR>
The moon, as fair, as when Endymion<BR>
She circled in her naked arms: with tent,<BR>
Christian or Saracen, was Paris-town<BR>
Seen in that gleam, and hill and plain&#8217;s extent.<BR>
With these Mount Martyr and Mount Levy&#8217;s height,<BR>
This on the left, and that upon the right.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXVI.</TD><TD>
The silvery splendor glistened yet more clear,<BR>
There where renowned Almontes&#8217; son lay dead.<BR>
Faithful Medoro mourned his master dear,<BR>
Who well agnized the quartering white and red,<BR>
With visage bathed in many a bitter tear<BR>
(For he a rill from either eyelid shed),<BR>
And piteous act and moan, that might have whist<BR>
The winds, his melancholy plaint to list;</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXVII.</TD><TD>
But with a voice supprest: not that he aught<BR>
Regards if any one the noise should hear,<BR>
Because he of his life takes any thought;<BR>
Of which loathed burden he would fain be clear;<BR>
But, lest his being heard should bring to nought<BR>
The pious purpose which has brought them here.<BR>
The youths the king upon their shoulders stowed;<BR>
And so between themselves divide the load.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXVIII.</TD><TD>
Hurrying their steps, they hastened, as they might,<BR>
Under the cherished burden they conveyed;<BR>
And now approaching was the lord of light,<BR>
To sweep from heaven the stars, from earth the shade.<BR>
When good Zerbino, he, whose valiant sprite<BR>
Was ne&#8217;er in time of need by sleep down-weighed,<BR>
From chasing Moors all night, his homeward way<BR>
Was taking to the camp at dawn of day.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CLXXXIX.</TD><TD>
He has with him some horsemen in his train,<BR>
That from afar the two companions spy.<BR>
Expecting thus some spoil or prize to gain,<BR>
They, every one, towards that quarter hie.<BR>
&#8220;Brother, behoves us,&#8221; cried young Cloridane,<BR>
&#8220;To cast away the load we bear, and fly:<BR>
For &#8217;twere a foolish thought (might well be said)<BR>
To lose two living men, to save one dead:</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXC.</TD><TD>
And dropt the burden, weening his Medore<BR>
Had done the same by it, upon his side:<BR>
But that poor boy, who loved his master more,<BR>
His shoulders to the weight, alone, applied;<BR>
Cloridan hurrying with all haste before,<BR>
Deeming him close behind him or beside;<BR>
Who, did he know his danger, him to save<BR>
A thousand deaths, instead of one, would brave.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCI.</TD><TD>
Those horsemen, with intent to make the two<BR>
Yield themselves prisoners to their band, or die,<BR>
Some here, some there, disperse the champaign through,<BR>
And every pass and outlet occupy.<BR>
The captain, little distant from his crew,<BR>
Is keener than the rest the chase to ply;<BR>
And, when he sees them hurrying in such guise,<BR>
Is certain that the twain are enemies.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=right valign=top>CXCII.</TD><TD>
Of old an ancient forest clothed that lair,<BR>
Of trees and underwood a tangled maze;<BR>
Of salvage beasts alone the wild repair,<BR>
And, like a labyrinth, full of narrow ways:<BR>
Here from the boughs such shelter hope the pair<BR>
As may conceal them well from hostile gaze.<BR>
But him I shall expect who loves the rhyme,<BR>
To listen to my tale some other time.</TD></TR>
