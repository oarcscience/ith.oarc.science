<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">THE POESY OF SKALDS[1]</H2>
<P>I. A certain man was named &AElig;gir, or Hl&eacute;r. He dwelt on the island which is now called Hl&eacute;r's Isle,[2] and was deeply versed in black magic. He took his way to &Aacute;sgard, but the &AElig;sir had foreknowledge of his journey; he was received with good cheer, and yet many things were done by deceit, with eye-illusions. And at evening, when it was time for drinking, Odin had swords brought into the hall, so bright that light radiated from them: and other illumination was not used while they sat at drinking. The n the &AElig;sir came in to their banquet, and in the high-seats sat them down those twelve &AElig;sir who were appointed to be judges; these were their names: Thor, Nj&ouml;rdr, Freyr, T&yacute;r, Heimdallr, Bragi, V&iacute;darr, V&aacute;li, Ullr, Hœnir, Forseti, Loki; and in like manner the &Aacute;synjur: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Idunn, Gerdr, Sigyn, Fulla, Nanna. It seemed glorious to &AElig;gir to look about him in the hall: the wainscottings there were all hung with fair shields; there was also stinging mead, copiously quaffed. The man seated next to &AElig;gir was Bragi, and they took part together in drinking and in converse: Bragi told &AElig;gir of many things which had come to pass among the &AElig;sir.</P>
<P>He began the story at the point where three of the &AElig;sir, Odin and Loki and Hœnir, departed from home and were wandering over mountains and wastes, and food was hard to find. But when they came down into a certain dale, they saw a herd of oxen, took one ox, and set about cooking it. Now when they thought that it must be cooked, they broke up the fire, and it was not cooked. After a while had passed, they having scattered the fire a</P>

<P>2. Now L&aelig;ss&oslash;.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 90}</P>
<P>second time, and it was not cooked, they took counsel together, asking each other what it might mean. Then they heard a voice speaking in the oak up above them, declaring that he who sat there confessed he had caused the lack of virtue in the fire. They looked thither, and there sat an eagle; and it was no small one. Then the eagle said: "If ye are willing to give me my fill of the ox, then it will cook in the fire." They assented to this. Then he let himself float down from the tree and alighted by the fire, and forthwith at the very first took unto himself the two hams of the ox, and both shoulders. Then Loki was angered, snatched up a great pole, brandished it with all his strength, and drove it at the eagle's body. The eagle plunged violently at the blow and flew up, so that the pole was fast to the eagle's back, and Loki's hands to the other end of the pole. The eagle flew at such a height that Loki's feet down below knocked against stones and rock-heaps and trees, and he thought his arms would be torn from his shoulders. He cried aloud, entreating the eagle urgently for peace; but the eagle declared that Loki should never be loosed, unless he would give him his oath to induce Idunn to come out of &Aacute;sgard with her apples. Loki assented, and being straightway loosed, went to his companions; nor for that time are any more things reported concerning their journey, until they had come home.</P>
<P>But at the appointed time Loki lured Idunn out of &Aacute;sgard into a certain wood, saying that he had found such apples as would seem to her of great virtue, and prayed that she would have her apples with her and compare them with these. Then Thjazi the giant came there in his eagle's plumage and took Idunn and flew away with her, off into Thrymheimr to his abode.</P>
<P>{p. 91}</P>
<P>But the &AElig;sir became straitened at the disappearance of Idunn, and speedily they became hoary and old. Then those, &AElig;sir took counsel together, and each asked the other what had last been known of Idunn; and the last that had been seen was that she had gone out of &Aacute;sgard with Loki. Thereupon Loki was seized and brought to the Thing, and was threatened with death, or tortures; when he had become well frightened, he declared that he would seek after Idunn in J&ouml;tunheim, if Freyja would lend him the hawk's plumage which she possessed. And when he got the hawk's plumage, he flew north into J&ouml;tunheim, and came on a certain day to the home of Thjazi the giant. Thjazi had rowed out to sea, but Idunn was at home alone: Loki turned her into the shape of a nut and grasped her in his claws and flew his utmost.</P>
<P>Now when Thjazi came home and missed Idunn, he took his eagle's plumage and flew after Loki, making a mighty rush of sound with his wings in his flight. But when the &AElig;sir saw how the hawk flew with the nut, and where the eagle was flying, they went out below &Aacute;sgard and bore burdens of plane-shavings thither. As soon as the hawk flew into the citadel, he swooped down close by the castle-wall; then the &AElig;sir struck fire to the plane-shavings. But the eagle could not stop himself when he missed the hawk: the feathers of the eagle caught fire, and straightway his flight ceased. Then the &AElig;sir were near at hand and slew Thjazi the giant within the Gate of the &AElig;sir, and that slaying is exceeding famous.</P>
<P>Now Skadi, the daughter of the giant Thjazi, took helm and birnie and all weapons of war and proceeded to &Aacute;sgard, to avenge her father. The &AElig;sir, however, offered her reconciliation and atonement: the first article was that she should</P>
<P>{p. 92}</P>
<P>choose for herself a husband from among the &AElig;sir and choose by the feet only, seeing no more of him. Then she saw the feet of one man, passing fair, and said: "I choose this one: in Baldr little can be loathly." But that was Nj&ouml;rdr of N&oacute;at&uacute;n. She had this article also in her bond of reconciliation: that the &AElig;sir must do a thing she thought they would not be able to accomplish: to make her laugh. Then Loki did this: he tied a cord to the beard of a goat, the other end being about his own genitals, and each gave way in turn, and each of the two screeched loudly; then Loki let himself fall onto Skadi's knee, and she laughed. Thereupon reconciliation was made with her on the part of the &AElig;sir. It is so said, that Odin did this by way of atonement to Skadi: he took Thjazi's eyes and cast them up into the heavens, and made of them two stars.</P>
<P>Then said &AElig;gir: "It seems to me that Thjazi was a mighty man: now of what family was he?" Bragi answered: "His father was called &Ouml;lvaldi, and if I tell thee of him, thou wilt think these things wonders. He was very rich in gold; but when he died and his sons came to divide the inheritance, they determined upon this measure for the gold which they divided: each should take as much as his mouth would hold, and all the same number of mouthfuls. One of them was Thjazi, the second Idi, the third Gangr. And we have it as a metaphor among us now, to call gold the mouth-tale of these giants; but we conceal it in secret terms or in poesy in this way, that we call it Speech, or Word, or Talk, of these giants."</P>
<P>Then said &AElig;gir: "I deem that well concealed in secret terms." And again said &AElig;gir: "Whence did this art, which ye call <I>poesy</I>, derive its beginnings?" Bragi answered: "These were the beginnings thereof. The gods had a dispute</P>
<P>{p. 93}</P>
<P>with the folk which are called Vanir, and they appointed a peace-meeting between them and established peace in this way: they each went to a vat and spat their spittle therein. Then at parting the gods took that peace-token and would not let it perish, but shaped thereof a man. This man is called Kvasir, and he was so wise that none could question him concerning anything but that he knew the solution. He went up and down the earth to give instruction to men; and when he came upon invitation to the abode of certain dwarves, Fjalar and Galarr, they called him into privy converse with them, and killed him, letting his blood run into two vats and a kettle. The kettle is named &Oacute;drerir, and the vats S&oacute;n and Bodn; they blended honey with the blood, and the outcome was that mead by the virtue of which he who drinks becomes a skald or scholar. The dwarves reported to the &AElig;sir that Kvasir had choked on his own shrewdness, since there was none so wise there as to be able to question his wisdom.</P>
<P>"Then these dwarves invited the giant who is called Gillingr to visit them, and his wife with him. Next the dwarves invited Gillingr to row upon the sea with them; but when they had gone out from the land, the dwarves rowed into the breakers and capsized the boat. Gillingr was unable to swim, and he perished; but the dwarves righted their boat and rowed to land. They reported this accident to his wife, but she took it grievously and wept aloud. Then Fjalar asked her whether it would ease her heart if she should look out upon the sea at the spot where he had perished; and she desired it. Then he spoke softly to Galarr his brother, bidding him go up over the doorway, when she should go out, and let a mill-stone fall on her head, saying that her weeping grew wearisome to him; and even so he did.</P>
<P>{p. 94}</P>
<P>"Now when the giant Suttungr, Gillingr's son, learned of this, he went over and took the dwarves and carried them out to sea, and set them on a reef which was covered at high tide. They besought Suttungr to grant them respite of their lives, and as the price of reconciliation offered him the precious mead in satisfaction of his father's death. And that became a means of reconciliation between them. Suttungr carried the mead home and concealed it in the place called Hnitbj&ouml;rg, placing his daughter Gunnl&ouml;d there to watch over it. Because of this we call poesy Kvasir's Blood or Dwarves' Drink, or Fill, or any kind of liquid of &Oacute;drerir, or of Bodn, or of S&oacute;n, or Ferry-Boat of Dwarves--since this mead brought them life--ransom from the reef--or Suttungr's Mead, or Liquor of Hnitbj&ouml;rg."</P>
<P>Then &AElig;gir said: "These seem to me dark sayings, to call poesy by these names. But how did ye &AElig;sir come at Suttungr's Mead?" Bragi answered: "That tale runs thus: Odin departed from home and came to a certain place where nine thralls were mowing hay. He asked if they desired him to whet their scythes, and they assented. Then he took a hone from his belt and whetted the scythes; it seemed to them that the scythes cut better by far, and they asked that the hone be sold them. But he put such a value on it that whoso desired to buy must give a considerable price: nonetheless all said that they would agree, and prayed him to sell it to them. He cast the hone up into the air; but since all wished to lay their hands on it, they became so intermingled with one another that each struck with his scythe against the other's neck.</P>
<P>"Odin sought a night's lodging with the giant who is called Baugi, Suttungr's brother. Baugi bewailed his husbandry, saying that his nine thralls had killed one another,</P>
<P>{p. 95}</P>
<P>and declared that he had no hope of workmen. Odin called himself B&ouml;lverkr in Baugi's presence; he offered to undertake nine men's work for Baugi, and demanded for his wages one drink of Suttungr's Mead. Baugi declared that he had no control whatever over the mead, and said that Suttungr was determined to have it to himself, but promised to go with B&ouml;lverkr and try if they might get the mead. During the summer B&ouml;lverkr accomplished nine men's work for Baugi, but when winter came he asked Baugi for his hire. Then they both set out for Suttungr's. Baugi told Suttungr his brother of his bargain with B&ouml;lverkr; but Suttungr flatly refused them a single drop of the mead. Then B&ouml;lverkr made suggestion to Baugi that they try certain wiles, if perchance they might find means to get at the mead; and Baugi agreed readily. Thereupon B&ouml;lverkr drew out the auger called Rati, saying that Baugi must bore the rock, if the auger cut. He did so. At last Baugi said that the rock was bored through, but B&ouml;lverkr blew into the auger-hole, and the chips flew up at him. Then he discovered that Baugi would have deceived him, and he bade him bore through the rock. Baugi bored anew; and when B&ouml;lverkr blew a second time, then the chips were blown in by the blast. Then B&ouml;lverkr turned himself into a serpent and crawled into the auger-hole, but Baugi thrust at him from behind with the auger and missed him. B&ouml;lverkr proceeded to the place where Gunnl&ouml;d was, and lay with her three nights; and then she gave him leave to drink three draughts of the mead. In the first draught he drank every drop out of &Oacute;drerir; and in the second, he emptied Bodn; and in the third, S&oacute;n; and then he had all the mead. Then he turned himself into the shape of an eagle and flew as furiously as he could; but when Suttungr saw the eagle's</P>
<P>{p. 96}</P>
<P>flight, he too assumed the fashion of an eagle and flew after him. When the &AElig;sir saw Odin flying, straightway they set out their vats in the court; and when Odin came into &Aacute;sgard, he spat up the mead into the vats. Nevertheless he came so near to being caught by Suttungr that he sent some mead backwards, and no heed was taken of this: whosoever would might have that, and we call that the poetaster's part.[1] But Odin gave the mead of Suttungr to the &AElig;sir and to those men who possess the ability to compose. Therefore we call poesy Odin's Booty and Find, and his Drink and Gift, and the Drink of the &AElig;sir."</P>
<P>Then said &AElig;gir: "In how many ways are the terms of skaldship variously phrased, or how many are the essential elements of the skaldic art?" Then Bragi answered: "The elements into which all poesy is divided are two." &AElig;gir asked: "What two?" Bragi said: "Metaphor and metre." "What manner of metaphor is used for skaldic writing?" "Three are the types of skaldic metaphor." "Which?" "Thus: [first], calling everything by its name; the second type is that which is called 'substitution;' the third type of metaphor is that which is called 'periphrasis,' and this type is employed in such manner: Suppose I take Odin, or Thor, or T&yacute;r, or any of the &AElig;sir or Elves; and to any of them whom I mention, I add the name of a property of some other of the &AElig;sir, or I record certain works of his. Thereupon he becomes owner of the name, and not the one whose name was applied to him: just as when we speak of Victory-T&yacute;r, or T&yacute;r of the Hanged, or T&yacute;r of Cargoes: that then becomes Odin's name: and we call these periphrastic names. So also with the title T&yacute;r of the Wain.[2]</P>

<P>2. T&yacute;r. See discussion in Cl.-Vig., p. 647. This word as a proper name refers {footnote p. 97} to the one-armed God of War; but, especially in compounds, it has the sense of God, the God, and is usually applied to Odin. The compounds mentioned here by Snorri are all epithets of Odin. See Gylfaginning, p. 30.]</P>

<P>"But now one thing must be said to young skalds, to such as yearn to attain to the craft of poesy and to increase their store of figures with traditional metaphors; or to those who crave to acquire the faculty of discerning what is said in hidden phrase: let such an one, then, interpret this book to his instruction and pleasure. Yet one is not so to forget or discredit these traditions as to remove from poesy those ancient metaphors with which it has pleased Chief Skalds to be content; nor, on the other hand, ought Christian men to believe in heathen gods, nor in the truth of these tales otherwise than precisely as one may find here in the beginning of the book.</P>
<P>II. Now you may hear examples of the way in which Chief Skalds have held it becoming to compose, making use of these simple terms and periphrases: as when Arn&oacute;rr Earls' Skald says that Odin is called Allfather:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now I'll tell men the virtue<BR>
Of the terrible Jarl;<BR>
Allfather's Song-Surf streams;<BR>
Late my sorrows lighten,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here, moreover, he calls poesy the Song-Surf of Allfather. H&aacute;vardr the Halt sang thus:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now is the flight of eagles<BR>
Over the field; the sailors<BR>
Of the sea-horses hie them<BR>
To the Hanged-God's gifts and feasting.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 98}</P>
<P>Thus sang Viga-Gl&uacute;mr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With the Hanged-God's helmet<BR>
The hosts have ceased from going<BR>
By the brink; not pleasant<BR>
The bravest held the venture.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Refr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oft the Gracious One came to me<BR>
At the holy cup of the Raven-God;<BR>
The king of the stem-ploughed sea's gold<BR>
From the skald in death is sundered.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And Sigurdr,<BR>
He who sated the ravens<BR>
Of Cargo-God<BR>
With the gore of the host<BR>
Of slain Haddings<BR>
Of life was spoiled<BR>
By the earth-rulers<BR>
At &Ouml;gl&oacute;.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Gl&uacute;mr Geirason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There the T&yacute;r of Triumph<BR>
Himself inspired the terror<BR>
Of ships; the gods of breezes<BR>
That favor good men steered them.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Eyvindr:</P>
<P>{p. 99}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>G&ouml;ndull and Sk&ouml;gull<BR>
Gauta-T&yacute;r sent<BR>
To choose from kings<BR>
Who of Yngvi's kin<BR>
Should go with Odin<BR>
And be in Valhall.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang &Uacute;lfr Uggason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Swiftly the Far-Famed rideth,<BR>
The Foretelling God, to the fire speeds,<BR>
To the wide pyre of his offspring;<BR>
Through my cheeks praise-songs are pouring.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr of Hvin:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The slain lay there sand-strewing,<BR>
Spoil for the Single-Eyed<BR>
Dweller in Frigg's bosom;<BR>
In such deeds we rejoiced.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Hallfredr sang thus:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The doughty ship-possessor<BR>
With sharpened words and soothfast<BR>
Lures our land, the patient,<BR>
Barley-lock&egrave;d Wife of Thridi.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here is an example of this metaphor, that in poesy the earth is called the Wife of Odin. Here is told what Eyvindr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Herm&oacute;dr and Bragi,<BR>
Spake Hropta-T&yacute;r.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 100}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Go ye to greet the Prince;<BR>
For a king who seemeth<BR>
A champion cometh<BR>
To the hall hither.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Korm&aacute;kr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Giver of Lands, who bindeth<BR>
The sail to the top, with gold-lace<BR>
Honors him who pours god's verse-mead;<BR>
Odin wrought charms on Rindr.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Steinth&oacute;rr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Much have I to laud<BR>
The ancient-made (though little)<BR>
Liquor of the valiant<BR>
Load of Gunnl&ouml;d's arm-clasp.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang &Uacute;lfr Uggason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There I think the Valkyrs follow,<BR>
And ravens, Victorious Odin<BR>
To the blood of holy Baldr.<BR>
With old tales the hall was painted.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Egill Skallagr&iacute;msson:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No victims for this<BR>
To V&iacute;li's brother,<BR>
The High-God, I offer,<BR>
Glad to behold him;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 101}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Yet has M&iacute;mir's friend<BR>
On me bestowed<BR>
Amends of evil<BR>
Which I account better.</P>
<P>He has given me the art<BR>
He, the Wolf's Opposer,<BR>
Accustomed to battle,<BR>
Of blemish blameless.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here he is called High God, and Friend of M&iacute;mir, and Adversary of the Wolf.</P>
<P>Thus sang Refr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Swift God of Slain, that wieldeth<BR>
The snowy billow's wave-hawks,<BR>
The ships that drive the sea-road,<BR>
To thee we owe the dwarves' drink.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Einarr Tinkling-Scale:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'T is mine to pour the liquor<BR>
Of the Host-God's mead-cask freely<BR>
Before the ships' swift Speeder:<BR>
For this I win no scorning.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang &Uacute;lfr Uggason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>His steed the lordly Heimdallr<BR>
Spurs to the pyre gods builded<BR>
For the fallen son of Odin,<BR>
The All-Wise Raven-Ruler.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 102}</P>
<P>This is said in <I>Eir&iacute;ksm&aacute;l</I>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>What dream is that? quoth Odin,--<BR>
I thought to rise ere day-break<BR>
To make Valhall ready<BR>
For troops of slain;<BR>
I roused the champions,<BR>
Bade them rise swiftly<BR>
Benches to strew,<BR>
To wash beer-flagons;<BR>
The Valkyrs to pour wine,<BR>
As a Prince were coming.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Korm&aacute;kr sang this:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I pray the precious Ruler<BR>
Of Yngvi's people, o'er me<BR>
To hold his hand, bow-shaking.<BR>
Hroptr bore with him Gungnir.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Th&oacute;r&aacute;lfr sang this:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Mighty One of Hlidskj&aacute;lf<BR>
Spake his mind unto them<BR>
Where the hosts of fearless<BR>
H&aacute;rekr were slaughtered.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Eyvindr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The mead which forth<BR>
From Surtr's sunk dales<BR>
The Strong-through-spells<BR>
Swift-flying bore.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 103}</P>
<P>So sang Bragi:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Tis seen, on my shield's surface,<BR>
How the Son of the Father of Peoples<BR>
Craved to try his strength full swiftly<BR>
'Gainst the rain-beat Snake earth-circling.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang E&iacute;narr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Since less with Bestla's Offspring<BR>
Prevail most lordly princes<BR>
Than thou, my task is singing<BR>
Thy praise in songs of battle.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Thorvaldr Blending-Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now have I much<BR>
In the middle grasped<BR>
Of the son of Borr,<BR>
Of B&uacute;ri's heir.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>III. "Now you shall hear how the skalds have termed the art of poesy in these metaphorical phrases which have been recorded before: for example, by calling it Kvasir's Gore and Ship of the Dwarves, Dwarves' Mead, Mead of the &AElig;sir, Giants' Father-Ransom, Liquor of &Oacute;drerir and of Bodn and of S&oacute;n, and Fullness of these, Liquor of Hnitbj&ouml;rg, Booty and Find and Gift of Odin, even as has been sung in these verses which Einarr Tinkling-Scale wrought:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I pray the high-souled Warder<BR>
Of earth to hear the Ocean<BR>
Of the Cliff of Dwarves, my verses:<BR>
Hear, Earl, the Gore of Kvasir.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 104}</P>
<P>And as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Dwarves' Crag's Song-wave rushes<BR>
O'er all the dauntless shield-host<BR>
Of him who speeds the fury<BR>
Of the shield-wall's piercing sword-bane.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Even as Ormr Steinth&oacute;rsson sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The body of the dame<BR>
And my dead be borne<BR>
Into one hall; the Drink<BR>
Of Dvalinn, Franklins, hear.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Refr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I reveal the Thought's Drink<BR>
Of the Rock-Folk to Thorsteinn;<BR>
The Billow of the Dwarf-Crag<BR>
Plashes; I bid men hearken.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Even as Egill sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Prince requires my lore,<BR>
And bound his praise to pour,<BR>
Odin's Mead I bore<BR>
To English shore.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Gl&uacute;mr Geirason sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Let the Princely Giver hearken:<BR>
I hold the God-King's liquor.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 105}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Let silence, then, be granted,<BR>
While we sing the loss of thanes.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Eyvindr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A hearing I crave<BR>
For the High One's Liquor,<BR>
While I utter<BR>
Gillingr's Atonement;<BR>
While his kin<BR>
In the Kettle-Brewing<BR>
Of the Gallows-Lord<BR>
To the gods I trace.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Even as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Wave of Odin surges;<BR>
Of &Oacute;drerir's Sea a billow<BR>
'Gainst the tongue's song-glade crashes;<BR>
Aye our King's works are goodly.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as he sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now that which Bodn's Billow<BR>
Bodes forth will straight be uttered:<BR>
Let the War-King's host make silence<BR>
In the hall, and hear the Dwarves' Ship.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Eil&iacute;fr Gudr&uacute;narson sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Grant shall ye gifts of friendship,<BR>
Since grows of S&oacute;n the Seedling<BR>
In our tongue's fertile sedge-bank:<BR>
True praise of our High Lord.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 106}</P>
<P>Even as V&ouml;lu-Steinn sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Egill, hear the Heart-streams<BR>
Of Odin beat in cadence<BR>
'Gainst my palate's skerry;<BR>
The God's Spoil to me is given.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Ormr Steinth&oacute;rsson:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No verse of mine men need to fear,<BR>
No mockery I intertwine<BR>
In Odin's Spoil; my skill is sure<BR>
In forging songs of praise.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang &Uacute;lfr Uggason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I show to host-glad &Aacute;leifr<BR>
The Heart-Fjord's Shoal of Odin,--<BR>
My song: him do I summon<BR>
To hear the Gift of Gr&iacute;mnir.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Poesy is called Sea, or Liquid of the Dwarves, because Kvasir's blood was liquid in &Oacute;drerir before the mead was made, and then it was put into the kettle; wherefore it is called Odin's Kettle-Liquor, even as Eyvindr sang and as we have recorded before:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>While his kin<BR>
In the Kettle-Brewing<BR>
Of the Gallows-Lord<BR>
To the gods I trace.[1]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See page 105.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 107}</P>
<P>Moreover, poesy is called Ship or Ale of the Dwarves: ale is <I>l&iacute;&eth;</I>, and <I>li&eth;</I> is a word for ships; therefore it is held that it is for this reason that poesy is now called Ship of the Dwarves, even as this verse tells:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The wit of Gunnl&ouml;d's Liquor<BR>
In swelling wind-like fullness,<BR>
And the everlasting Dwarves' Ship<BR>
I own, to send the same road.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>IV. "What figures should be employed to periphrase the name of Thor? Thus: one should call him Son of Odin and of J&ouml;rd, Father of Magni and M&oacute;di and Thr&uacute;dr, Husband of Sif, Stepfather of Ullr, Wielder and Possessor of Mj&ouml;llnir and of the Girdle of Strength, and of Bilskirnir; Defender of &Aacute;sgard and of Midgard, Adversary and Slaver of Giants and Troll-Women, Smiter of Hrungnir, of Geirr&ouml;dr and of Thr&iacute;valdi, Master of Thj&aacute;lfi and R&ouml;skva, Foe of the Midgard Serpent. Foster-father of Vingnir and Hl&oacute;ra. So sang Bragi the Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The line of Odin's Offspring<BR>
Lay not slack on the gunwale,<BR>
When the huge ocean-serpent<BR>
Uncoiled on the sea's bottom.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang &Ouml;lvir Cut-Nose-and-Crop-Ears:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The enc&iacute;rcler of all regions<BR>
And J&ouml;rd's Son sought each other.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 108}</P>
<P>Thus sang Eil&iacute;fr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Wroth stood R&ouml;skva's Brother,<BR>
And Magni's Sire wrought bravely:<BR>
With terror Thor's staunch heart-stone<BR>
Trembled not, nor Thj&aacute;lfi's.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And thus sang Eysteinn Valdason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With glowing eyes Thr&uacute;dr's Father<BR>
Glared at the sea-road's circler,<BR>
Ere the fishes' watery dwelling<BR>
Flowed in, the boat confounding.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Eysteinn sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Swiftly Sif's Husband bouned him<BR>
To haste forth with the Giants<BR>
For his hardy fishing:<BR>
Well sing we Hr&iacute;mnir's horn-stream.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Again he sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The earth-fish tugged so fiercely<BR>
That Ullr's Kinsman's clenched fists<BR>
Were pulled out past the gunwale;<BR>
The broad planks rent asunder.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Bragi:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The strong fiend's Terrifier<BR>
In his right hand swung his hammer,<BR>
When he saw the loathly sea-fish<BR>
That all the lands confineth.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 109}</P>
<P>Thus sang Gamli:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>While the Lord of high Bilskirnir,<BR>
Whose heart no falsehood fashioned,<BR>
Swiftly strove to shatter<BR>
The sea-fish with his hammer.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Thorbj&ouml;rn Lady's-Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Bravely Thor fought for &Aacute;sgard<BR>
And the followers of Odin.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Bragi:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And the vast misshapen circler<BR>
Of the ship's sea-path, fierce-minded,<BR>
Stared from below in anger<BR>
At the Skull-Splitter of Hrungnir.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Again sang Bragi:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Well hast Thou, Hewer-in-Sunder<BR>
Of the nine heads of Thr&iacute;valdi,<BR>
Kept thy goats[1] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Eil&iacute;fr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Merciless Destroyer<BR>
Of the people of the Giants<BR>
Grasped with ready fore-arms<BR>
At the heavy red-hot iron.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The remainder of this stanza cannot be made out.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 110}</P>
<P>Thus sang &Uacute;lfr Uggason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Faintly the stout-framed thickling<BR>
A fearful peril called it,<BR>
At the great draught wondrous heavy<BR>
Drawn up by the Lord of he-goats.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus &Uacute;lfr sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The very mighty Slayer<BR>
Of the Mountain-Man brought crashing<BR>
His fist on Hymir's temple:<BR>
That was a hurt full deadly.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Yet again sang &Uacute;lfr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Vimur's ford's Wide-Grappler<BR>
'Gainst the waves smote featly<BR>
The glittering Serpent's head off.<BR>
With old tales the hall was gleaming.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here he is called Giant of Vimur's Ford. There is a river called Vimur, which Thor waded when he journeyed to the garth of Geirr&ouml;dr.</P>
<P>Thus sang Vetrlidi the skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thou didst break the leg of Leikn,<BR>
Didst cause to stoop Starkadr,<BR>
Didst bruise Thr&iacute;valdi,<BR>
Didst stand on lifeless Gj&aacute;lp.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Thorbj&ouml;rn Lady's-Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thou didst smite the head of Keila,<BR>
Smash Kjallandi altogether,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 111}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Ere thou slewest L&uacute;tr and Leidi,<BR>
Didst spill the blood of B&uacute;seyra;<BR>
Didst hold back Hengjankjapta,<BR>
Hyrrokkin died before;<BR>
Yet sooner in like fashion<BR>
Sv&iacute;v&ouml;r from life was taken.</P></DIR>

<P>V. "How should one periphrase Baldr? By calling him Son of Odin and Frigg, Husband of Nanna, Father of Forseti, Possessor of Hringhorni and Draupnir, Adversary of H&ouml;dr, Companion of Hel, God of Tears. &Uacute;lfr Uggason, following the story of Baldr, has composed a long passage in the <I>H&uacute;sdr&aacute;pa</I>; and examples are recorded earlier to the effect that Baldr is so termed.</P>
<P>VI. "How should one periphrase Nj&ouml;rdr? By calling him God of the Vanir, or Kinsman of the Vanir, or Wane, Father of Freyr and Freyja, God of Wealth-Bestowal.</P>
<P>So says Th&oacute;rdr Sj&aacute;reksson:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Gudrun's self by ill<BR>
Her sons did kill;<BR>
The wise God-bride<BR>
At the Wane's side<BR>
Grieved; men tell<BR>
Odin tamed steeds well;<BR>
'T was not the saying<BR>
Hamdir spared sword-playing.</P></DIR>

<P>Here it is recorded that Skadi departed from Nj&ouml;rdr, as has already been written.</P>

<P>VII. "How should one periphrase Freyr? Thus: by calling him Son of Nj&ouml;rdr, Brother of Freyja, and also God of Vanir, and Kinsman of the Vanir, and Wane, and God of the Fertile Season, and God of Wealth-Gifts.</P>
<P>Thus sang Egill Skallagr&iacute;msson:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>For that Grj&oacute;tbj&ouml;rn<BR>
In goods and gear<BR>
Freyr and Nj&ouml;rdr<BR>

</DIR>

<P>Freyr is called Adversary of Beli, even as Eyvindr Spoiler of Skalds sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When the Earl's foe<BR>
Wished to inhabit<BR>
The outer bounds<BR>
Of Beli's hater.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>He is the possessor of Sk&iacute;dbladnir and of that boar which is called Gold-Bristle, even as it is told here:</P><DIR>

In ancient days<BR>
Went to shape Sk&iacute;dbladnir,<BR>
Foremost of ships,<BR>
Fairly for Freyr,<BR>
Choicely for Nj&ouml;rdr's child.</P></DIR>

<P>Thus speaks &Uacute;lfr Uggason:</P><DIR>

<P>The battle-bold Freyr rideth<BR>

<P>{p. 113}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Barrow-boar to the bale-fire<BR>
Of Baldr, and leads the people.</P></DIR>

<P>The boar is also called Fearful-Tusk.</P>
<P>VIII. "How should one periphrase Heimdallr? By calling him Son of Nine Mothers, or Watchman of the Gods, as already has been written; or White God, Foe of Loki, Seeker of Freyja's Necklace. A sword is called Heimdallr's Head: for it is said that he was pierced by a man's head. The tale thereof is told in <I>Heimdalar-galdr</I>; and ever since a head is called Heimdallr's Measure; a sword is called Man's Measure. Heimdallr is the Possessor of Gulltoppr; he is also Frequenter of V&aacute;gasker and Singasteinn, where he contended with Loki for the Necklace Br&iacute;singa-men, he is also called Vindl&eacute;r. &Uacute;lfr Uggason composed a long passage in the <I>H&uacute;sdr&aacute;pa</I> on that legend, and there it is written that they were in the form of seals. Heimdallr also is son of Odin.</P>
<P>IX. "How should one periphrase T&yacute;r? By calling him the One-handed God, and Fosterer of the Wolf, God of Battles, Son of Odin.</P>
<P>X. "How should one periphrase Bragi? By calling him Husband of Idunn, First Maker of Poetry, and the Long-bearded God (after his name, a man who has a great beard is called Beard-Bragi) and Son of Odin.</P>

<P>the Homesteads of the Fathers, Son of Odin, and Brother of the &AElig;sir.</P>

<P>The famed rain-bow's defender,<BR>
Ready in wisdom, striveth<BR>

<P>Here it is written that Heimdallr is the son of nine mothers.</P>
<P>XVII. "Now an account shall be given of the source of those metaphors which have but now been recorded, and of which no accounts were rendered before: even such as Bragi gave to &AElig;gir, telling how Thor had gone into the east to slay trolls, and Odin rode Sleipnir into J&ouml;tunheim and visited that giant who was named Hrungnir. Hrungnir asked what manner of man he with the golden helm might be, who rode through air and water; and said that the stranger had a wondrous good steed. Odin said he would wager his head there was no horse in J&ouml;tunheim that would prove equally good. Hrungnir answered that it was a good horse, but declared that he had a much better paced horse which was called Gold-Mane. Hrungnir had become angry, and vaulted up onto his horse and galloped after him, thinking to pay him for his boasting. Odin gal loped so furiously that he was on the top of the next hill first; but Hrungnir was so filled with the giant's frenzy</P>
<P>{p. 116}</P>
<P>that he took no heed until he had come in beyond the gates of &Aacute;sgard. When he came to the hall-door, the &AElig;sir invited him to drink. He went within and ordered drink to be brought to him, and then those flagons were brought in from which Thor was wont to drink; and Hrungnir swilled from each in turn. But when he had become drunken, then big words were not wanting: he boasted that he would lift up Valhall and carry it to J&ouml;tunheim, and sink &Aacute;sgard and kill all the gods, save that he would take Freyja and Sif home with him. Freyja alone dared pour for him; and he vowed that he would drink all the ale of the &AElig;sir. But when his overbearing insolence became tiresome to the &AElig;sir, they called on the name of Thor.</P>
<P>"Straightway Thor came into the hall, brandishing his hammer, and he was very wroth, and asked who had advised that these dogs of giants be permitted to drink there, or who had granted Hrungnir safe-conduct to be in Valhall, or why Freyja should pour for him as at a feast of the &AElig;sir. Then Hrungnir answered, looking at Thor with no friendly eyes, and said that Odin had invited him to drink, and he was under his safe-conduct. Thor declared that Hrungnir should repent of that invitation before he got away. Hrungnir answered that &Aacute;sa-Thor would have scant renown for killing him, weaponless as he was: it were a greater trial of his courage if he dared fight with Hrungnir on the border at Grj&oacute;t&uacute;nagard. 'And it was a great folly,' said he, 'when I left my shield and hone behind at home; if I had my weapons here, then we should try single-combat. But as matters stand, I declare thee a coward if thou wilt slay me, a weaponless man.' Thor was by no means anxious to avoid the fight when challenged to the field, for no one had ever offered him single-combat before.</P>
<P>{p. 117}</P>
<P>"Then Hrungnir went his way, and galloped furiously until he came to J&ouml;tunheim. The news of his journey was spread abroad among the giants, and it became noised abroad that a meeting had been arranged between him and Thor; the giants deemed that they had much at stake, who should win the victory, since they looked for ill at Thor's hands if Hrungnir perished, he being strongest of them all. Then the giants made a man of clay at Grj&oacute;t&uacute;nagard: he was nine miles high and three broad under the arm-pits; but they could get no heart big enough to fit him, until they took one from a mare. Even that was not steadfast within him, when Thor came. Hrungnir had the heart which is notorious, of hard stone and spiked with three corners, even as the written character is since formed, which men call Hrungnir's Heart. His head also was of stone; his shield too was stone, wide and thick, and he had the shield before him when he stood at Grj&oacute;t&uacute;nagard and waited for Thor. Moreover he had a hone for a weapon, and brandished it over his shoulders, and he was not a pretty sight. At one side of him stood the clay giant, which was called M&ouml;kkurk&aacute;lfi: he was sore afraid, and it is said that he wet himself when he saw Thor.</P>
<P>"Thor went to the meeting-place, and Thj&aacute;lfi with him. Then Thj&aacute;lfi ran forward to the spot where Hrungnir stood and said to him: 'Thou standest unwarily, Giant, having the shield before thee: for Thor has seen thee, and comes hither down below the earth, and will come at thee from beneath.' Then Hrungnir thrust the shield under his feet and stood upon it, wielding the hone with both hands. Then speedily he saw lightnings and heard great claps of thunder; then he saw Thor in God-like anger, who came forward furiously and swung the hammer and cast it at Hrungnir</P>
<P>{p. 118}</P>
<P>from afar off. Hrungnir lifted up the hone in both hands and cast it against him; it struck the hammer in flight, and the hone burst in sunder: one part fell to the earth, and thence are come all the flint-rocks; the other burst on Thor's head, so that he fell forward to the earth. But the hammer Mj&ouml;llnir struck Hrungnir in the middle of the head, and smashed his skull into small crumbs, and he fell forward upon Thor, so that his foot lay over Thor's neck. Thj&aacute;lfi struck at M&ouml;kkurk&aacute;lfi, and he fell with little glory. Thereupon Thj&aacute;lfi went over to Thor and would have lifted Hrungnir's foot off him, but could not find sufficient strength. Straightway all the &AElig;sir came up, when they, learned that Thor was fallen, and would have lifted the foot from off him, and could do nothing. Then Magni came up, son of Thor and J&aacute;rnsaxa: he was then three nights old; he cast the foot of Hrungnir off Thor, and spake: 'See how ill it is, father, that I came so late: I had struck this giant dead with my fist, methinks, if I had met with him.' Thor arose and welcomed his son, saying that he should surely become great; 'And I will give thee,' he said, the horse Gold-Mane, which Hrungnir possessed.' Then Odin spake and said that Thor did wrong to give the good horse to the son of a giantess, and not to his father.</P>
<P>"Thor went home to Thr&uacute;dvangar, and the hone remained sticking in his head. Then came the wise woman who was called Gr&oacute;a, wife of Aurvandill the Valiant: she sang her spells over Thor until the hone was loosened. But when Thor knew that, and thought that there was hope that the hone might be removed, he desired to reward Gr&oacute;a for her leech-craft and make her glad, and told her these things: that he had waded from the north over Icy Stream and had borne Aurvandill in a basket on his back from the</P>
<P>{p. 119}</P>
<P>north out of J&ouml;tunheim. And he added for a token, that one of Aurvandill's toes had stuck out of the basket, and became frozen; wherefore Thor broke it off and cast it up into the heavens, and made thereof the star called Aurvandill's Toe. Thor said that it would not be long ere Aurvandill came home: but Gr&oacute;a was so rejoiced that she forgot her incantations, and the hone was not loosened, and stands yet in Thor's head. Therefore it is forbidden to cast a hone across the floor, for then the hone is stirred in Thor's head. Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr of Hvin has made a song after this tale in the <I>Haustl&ouml;ng</I>. [It says there:</P><DIR>

<P>XVIII. Then said, &AElig;gir: "Methinks Hrungnir was of great might. Did Thor accomplish yet more valorous deeds when he had to do with the trolls?" And Bragi answered: "It is worthy to be told at length, how Thor went to Geirr&ouml;dr's dwelling. At that time he had not the hammer Mj&ouml;llnir with him, nor his Girdle of Might, nor the iron gauntlets: and that was the fault of Loki, who went with him. For once, flying in his sport with Frigg's hawk-plumage, it had happened to Loki to fly for curiosity's sake into Geirr&ouml;dr's court. There he saw a great hall, and alighted and looked in through the window; and Geirr&ouml;dr looked up and saw him, and commanded that the bird be taken and brought to him, But he who was sent could scarce get to the top of the wall, so high was it; and it seemed pleasant to Loki to see the man striving with toil and pains to reach him, and he thought it was not yet time to fly away until the other had accomplished the perilous climb. When the man pressed hard after him, then he stretched his wings for flight, and thrust out vehemently, but now his feet were stuck fast.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Passages enclosed within brackets are considered by J&oacute;nsson to be spurious.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 122}</P>
<P>So Loki was taken and brought before Geirr&ouml;dr the giant; but when Geirr&ouml;dr saw his eyes, he suspected that this might be a man, and bade him answer; but Loki was silent. Then Geirr&ouml;dr shut Loki into a chest and starved him there three months. And now when Geirr&ouml;dr took him out and commanded him to speak, Loki told who he was; and by way of ransom for his life he swore to Geirr&ouml;dr with oaths that he would get Thor to come into Geirr&ouml;dr's dwelling in such a fashion that he should have neither hammer nor Girdle of Might with him.</P>
<P>"Thor came to spend the night with that giantess who was called Gr&iacute;dr, mother of V&iacute;darr the Silent. She told Thor the truth concerning Geirr&ouml;dr, that he was a crafty giant and ill to deal with; and she lent him the Girdle of Might and iron gloves which she possessed, and her staff also, which was called Gr&iacute;dr's Rod. Then Thor proceeded to the river named Vimur, greatest of all rivers. There he girded himself with the Girdle of Might and braced firmly downstream with Gr&iacute;dr's Rod, and Loki held on behind by the Girdle of Might. When Thor came to mid-current, the river waxed so greatly that it broke high upon his shoulders. Then Thor sang this:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Wax thou not now, Vimur,<BR>
For I fain would wade thee<BR>
Into the Giants' garth:<BR>
Know thou, if thou waxest,<BR>
Then waxeth God-strength in me<BR>
As high up as the heaven.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"Then Thor saw Gj&aacute;lp, daughter of Geirr&ouml;dr, standing in certain ravines, one leg in each, spanning the river,</P>
<P>{p. 123}</P>
<P>and she was causing the spate. Then Thor snatched up a great stone out of the river and cast it at her, saying these words: 'At its source should a river be stemmed.' Nor did he miss that at which he threw. In that moment he came to the shore and took hold of a rowan-clump, and so climbed out of the river; whence comes the saying that rowan is Thor's deliverance.</P>
<P>"Now when Thor came before Geirr&ouml;dr, the companions were shown first into the goat-fold[1] for their entertainment, and there was one chair there for a seat, and Thor sat there. Then he became aware that the chair moved under him up toward the roof: he thrust Gr&iacute;dr's Rod up against the rafters and pushed back hard against the chair. Then there was a great crash, and screaming followed. Under the chair had been Geirr&ouml;dr's daughters, Gj&aacute;lp and Greip; and he had broken both their backs. Then Geirr&ouml;dr had Thor called into the hall to play games. There were great fires the whole length of the hall. When Thor came up over against Geirr&ouml;dr, then Geirr&ouml;dr took up a glowing bar of iron with the tongs and cast it at Thor. Thor caught it with his iron gloves and raised the bar in the air, but Geirr&ouml;dr leapt behind an iron pillar to save himself. Thor lifted up the bar and threw it, and it passed through the pillar and through Geirr&ouml;dr and through the wall, and so on out, even into the earth. Eil&iacute;fr Gudr&uacute;narson has wrought verses on this story, in <I>Th&oacute;rsdr&aacute;pa</I>:</P><DIR>

To meet the high god-rulers<BR>
Long hence in eagle-plumage;<BR>
The erne in old days lighted<BR>
Where the &AElig;sir meat were bearing<BR>
To the fire-pit; the Giant<BR>
Of the rocks was called no faint-heart.</P>
<P>The skilful god-deceiver<BR>
To the gods proved a stern sharer<BR>
Of bones: the high Instructor<BR>
Of &AElig;sir, helmet-hooded,<BR>
Saw some power checked the seething;<BR>
The sea-mew, very crafty,</P></DIR>

<P>Spake from the ancient tree-trunk;<BR>
Loki was ill-willed toward him.</P>
<P>The wolfish monster ordered<BR>
Meili's Sire to deal him<BR>
Food from the holy trencher:<BR>
The friend of Him of Ravens<BR>
To blow the fire was chosen;<BR>
The Giant-King, flesh-greedy,<BR>
Sank down, where the guileless<BR>
Craft-sparing gods were gathered.</P>
<P>The comely Lord of All Things<BR>
Commanded Loki swiftly<BR>
To part the bull's-meat, slaughtered<BR>
By Skadi's ringing bow-string,<BR>
Among the folk, but straightway<BR>
The cunning food-defiler<BR>
Of the &AElig;sir filched-the quarters,<BR>
All four, from the broad table.</P>
<P>And the hungry Sire of Giants<BR>
Savagely ate the yoke-beast<BR>
From the oak-tree's sheltering branches,--<BR>
That was in ancient ages,--<BR>
Ere the wise-minded Loki,<BR>
Warder of war-spoil, smote him,<BR>
Boldest of foes of Earth-Folk,<BR>
With a pole betwixt the shoulders.</P>
<P>The Arm-Burden then of Sigyn,<BR>
Whom all the gods in bonds see,</P></DIR>

<P>Firmly forthwith was fastened<BR>
To the Fosterer of Skadi;<BR>
To J&ouml;tunheim's Strong Dweller<BR>
The pole stuck, and the fingers<BR>
Of Loki too, companion<BR>
Of Hœnir, clung to the pole's end.</P>
<P>The Bird of Blood flew upward<BR>
(Blithesome in his quarry)<BR>
A long way off with Loki,<BR>
The lither God, that almost<BR>
Wolf's Sire was rent asunder;<BR>
Thor's friend must sue for mercy,<BR>
Such peace as he might purchase<BR>
To pray: nigh slain was Loptr.</P>
<P>Then Hymir's Kinsman ordered<BR>
The crafty god, pain-maddened,<BR>
To wile to him the Maiden<BR>
Who warded the &AElig;sir's age-cure;<BR>
Ere long the necklace-robber,<BR>
Br&iacute;singa's thief, lured slyly<BR>
The Dame of Brunnakr's brooklet<BR>
Into the Base One's dwelling.</P>
<P>At that the steep slope-dwellers<BR>
No sorrow felt; then Idunn<BR>
Was from the south, by giants<BR>
New-stolen, come among them.<BR>
All Ingvi-Freyr's high kindred,<BR>
Hoary and old, to council</P></DIR>

This heard I, that the Staunch Friend<BR>

Flew, in hawk-wings hidden;<BR>
And the vile Sire of Giants,<BR>
Vigorous Wing-Plume-Wielder,<BR>
Hurtled on eagle-pinion<BR>
After the hawk-shaped Loki.</P>
<P>Swiftly the gods have kindled<BR>
A fire; and the sovereign rulers<BR>
Sustained the flame with shavings:<BR>
Scorched was the flying giant,--<BR>
He plunged down in mid-soaring:<BR>
'Tis pictured on the giant's<BR>

With stories, Th&oacute;rleifr gave me.]</P></DIR>

<P>"This is the correct manner of periphrasing the &AElig;sir: To call each of them by the name of another, and to designate him in terms of his works or his possessions or his kindred.</P>

Young Lord of Shields on ship-deck<BR>
'Neath the ancient Skull of Ymir:<BR>

<P>Bright grows the sun at dusking,<BR>
The earth sinks into the dark sea,<BR>
The Toil of Austri bursteth;<BR>
All the ocean on the fells breaks.</P></DIR>

<P>Thus sang B&ouml;dvarr the Halt:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>For never 'neath the Sun's Plain<BR>
Shall come a nobler Land-Ward,<BR>
Keener in battle-onset,<BR>
Nor a brother of Ingi better.</P></DIR>

<P>And as Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr of Hvin sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>J&ouml;rd's Son drove to the steel-play<BR>
(High swelled the godlike anger<BR>
In the mind of Meili's Brother),<BR>
And the Moon-Way 'neath him quivered.</P></DIR>

Into the Winds' Wide Basin<BR>
O'er the abodes of men-folk many.</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>'Tis long since the dear-loved Warder<BR>
Of sea-men was born on the wave-girt earth-bottom<BR>
Of the Storm-Container; each man praises<BR>
The sublime age of the Ring-Dispenser.</P></DIR>

<P>Even as Steinn Herd&iacute;sarson sang:</P><DIR>

<P>I sing the holy Ruler<BR>
Of the high World-Tent rather<BR>
Than men, for very precious<BR>
Is He: His praises tell I.</P></DIR>

At the Doom-Seat parts all mortals.</P></DIR>

Even as Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler sang:</P><DIR>

<P>Now the beaming gold is hidden<BR>
In the body of the Mother<BR>
Of the Giants' Foe; the counsels<BR>
Of a kindred strong are mighty.</P></DIR>

<P>In council 't was determined<BR>
That the King's friend, wise in counsel,<BR>

Of &Oacute;narr, greenly wooded.</P></DIR>

<P>And he said further:</P>

<P>The Raven-Abode's brave Ruler<BR>

In the rowed hull doth fasten<BR>
The ships of men to the strand's end,<BR>

<P>Full loath to let the Land slip<BR>
I hold the lordly Spear-Prince<BR>
Audr's sister is subjected<BR>
To the splendid Treasure-Spender.</P></DIR>

<P>On the gravelly beach of good ships<BR>
Grates the Blood of Ymir.</P></DIR>

<P>As Refr sang:</P><DIR>

O'er the murky water from the westward<BR>
Her wave-pressed bows; the land I look for<BR>
Before the beak; the Whale-Home shallows.</P></DIR>

<P>When the fallow fell-wall's Whirlwinds<BR>
Wove o'er the waves full fiercely,<BR>
And &AElig;gir's storm-glad daughters<BR>
Tore, of grim frost begotten.</P></DIR>

<P>Gymir's wet-cold Spae-Wife<BR>
Wiles the Bear of Twisted Cables<BR>
Oft into &AElig;gir's wide jaws,<BR>
Where the angry billow breaketh.</P></DIR>

<P>It is said here that &AElig;gir and Gymir are both the same. And he sang further:</P><DIR>

The Swan-Land's steed sees Iceland<BR>
Into the surf receding.</P></DIR>

<P>Many a stiff rowlock straineth,<BR>
And the noisy Strand of Fish-Gear,<BR>
The Sea, the lands o'ercometh:<BR>
Men's hands oft span the stays.</P></DIR>

<P>And he sang yet further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The gray Isle-Fetter urges<BR>
Heiti's raven-ship onward;<BR>
Gold beaks the fleet ships carry:<BR>
Rich that faring to the Chieftain.</P></DIR>

<P>And he sang again:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Isle-Rim autumn chilly<BR>
Impels the dock's cold snowshoe.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And thus also:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The cool lands' Surging-Girdle<BR>
Before the beaks springs asunder.</P></DIR>

This blessing: Vindsvalr's Son.</P></DIR>

<P>XXX. "How should one periphrase summer? Thus: call</P>
<P>{p. 142}</P>
<P>it Son of Sv&aacute;sudr and Comfort of Serpents, and Growth of Men. Even as Egill Skallagr&iacute;msson sang:</P><DIR>

A deed we have for wreaking<BR>

<P>XXXI. "How should man be periphrased? By his works, by that which he gives or receives or does; he may also be periphrased in terms of his property, those things which he possesses, and, if he be liberal, of his liberality; likewise in terms of the families from which he descended, as well as of those which have sprung from him. How is one to periphrase him in terms of these things? Thus, by calling him accomplisher or performer of his goings or his conduct, of his battles or sea-voyages or huntings or weapons or ships. And because he is a tester of weapons and a winner of battles,--the words for 'winner' and 'wood' being the same, as are also those for tester' and 'rowan,'--therefore, from these phrases, skalds have called man Ash or Maple, Grove, or other masculine tree-names, and periphrased him in such expressions in terms of battles or ships or possessions. It is also correct to periphrase man with all the names of the &AElig;sir; also with giant-terms, and this last is for the most part for mocking or libellous purposes. Periphrasis with the names of elves is held to be favorable.</P>
<P>"Woman should be periphrased with reference to all female garments, gold and jewels, ale or wine or any other drink, or to that which she dispenses or gives; likewise with reference to ale-vessels, and to all those things which it becomes her to perform or to give. It is correct to periphrase</P>
<P>{p. 143}</P>
<P>her thus: by calling her giver or user of that of which she partakes. But the words for 'giver' and 'user' are also names of trees; therefore woman is called in metaphorical speech by all feminine tree-names. Woman is periphrased with reference to jewels or agates for this reason: in heathen times what was called a 'stone-necklace,' which they wore about the neck, was a part of a woman's apparel; now it is used figuratively in such a way as to periphrase woman with stones and all names of stones. Woman is also metaphorically called by the names of the &Aacute;synjur or the Valkyrs or Norris or women of supernatural kind. It is also correct to periphrase woman in terms of all her conduct or property or family.</P>
<P>XXXII. "How should gold be periphrased? Thus: by calling it &AElig;gir's Fire, and Needles of Glasir, Hair of Sif, Snood of Fulla, Freyja's Tears, Talk and Voice and Word of Giants, Draupnir's Drop and Rain or Shower of Draupnir, or of Freyja's Eyes, Otter's Ransom, Forced Payment of the &AElig;sir, Seed of F&yacute;ris-Plain, Cairn-Roof of H&ouml;lgi, Fire of all Waters and of the Hand, Stone and Reef or Gleam of the Hand.</P>
<P>XXXIII. Wherefore is gold called &AElig;gir's Fire? This tale is to the same purport as we have told before: &AElig;gir went to &Aacute;sgard to a feast, but when he was ready to return home, he invited Odin and all the &AElig;sir to visit him in three months' time. First came Odin and Nj&ouml;rdr, Freyr, T&yacute;r, Bragi, V&iacute;darr, Loki; likewise the &Aacute;synjur: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Skadi, Idunn, Sif. Thor was not there, having gone into the eastern lands to slay trolls. When the gods had sat down in their places, straightway &AElig;gir had bright gold</P>
<P>{p. 144}</P>
<P>brought in onto the floor of the hall, and the gold gave forth light and illumined the hall like fire: and it was used there for lights at his banquet, even as in Valhall swords were used in place of fire. Then Loki bandied sharp words with all the gods, and slew one of &AElig;gir's thralls, him who was called Five-Finger; another of his thralls was named Fire-Kindler. R&aacute;n is the name of &AElig;gir's wife, and their daughters are nine, even as we have written before. At this feast all things were self-served, both food and ale, and all implements needful to the feast. Then the &AElig;sir became aware that R&aacute;n had that net wherein she was wont to catch all men who go upon the sea. Now this tale is to show whence it comes that gold is called Fire or Light or Brightness of &AElig;gir, of R&aacute;n, or of &AElig;gir's daughters; and now such use is made of these metaphors that gold is called Fire of the Sea, and of all names of the sea, even as &AElig;gir or R&aacute;n had names associated with the sea. Therefore gold is now called Fire of Waters or of Rivers, and of all river names.</P>
<P>"But these names have fared just as other figures also have done: the later skalds have composed after the examples of the old skalds, even those examples which stood in their poems, but were later expanded into such forms as seemed to later poets to be like what was written before: as a lake is to the sea, or the river to the lake, or the brook to the river. Therefore all these are called new figures, when terms are expanded to greater length than what was recorded before; and all this seems well and good, so fair as it concurs with verisimilitude and nature. As Bragi the Skald sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I was given by the Battler<BR>
The fire of the Brook of Sea-Fish:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 145}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He gave it me, with mercy,<BR>
For the Drink of the Mountain-Giant.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XXXIV. "Why is gold called the Needles, or Leaves; of Glasir? In &Aacute;sgard, before the doors of Valhall, there stands a grove which is called Glasir, and its leafage is all red gold, even as is sung here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Glasir stands<BR>
With golden leafage<BR>
Before the High God's halls.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Far and wide, this tree is the fairest known among gods and men.</P>
<P>XXXV. "Why is gold called Sif's Hair? Loki Laufeyarson, for mischief's sake, cut off all Sif's hair. But when Thor learned of this, he seized Loki, and would have broken every bone in him, had he not sworn to get the Black Elves to make Sif hair of gold, such that it would grow like other hair. After that, Loki went to those dwarves who are called &Iacute;valdi's Sons; and they made the hair, and Sk&iacute;dbladnir also, and the spear which became Odin's possession, and was called Gungnir. Then Loki wagered his head with the dwarf called Brokkr that Brokkr's brother Sindri could not make three other precious things equal in virtue to these. Now when they came to the smithy, Sindri laid a pigskin in the hearth and bade Brokkr blow, and did not cease work until he took out of the hearth that which he had laid therein. But when he went out of the smithy, while the other dwarf was blowing, straightway a fly settled upon his hand and stung: yet he blew on</P>
<P>{p. 146}</P>
<P>as before, until the smith took the work out of the hearth; and it was a boar, with mane and bristles of gold. Next, he laid gold in the hearth and bade Brokkr blow and cease not from his blast until he should return. He went out; but again the fly came and settled on Brokkr's neck, and bit now half again as hard as before; yet he blew even until the smith took from the hearth that gold ring which is called Draupnir. Then Sindri laid iron in the hearth and bade him blow, saying that it would be spoiled if the blast failed. Straightway the fly settled between Brokkr's eyes and stung his eyelid, but when the blood fell into his eyes so that he could not see, then he clutched at it with his hand as swiftly as he could,--while the bellows grew flat,--and he swept the fly from him. Then the smith came thither and said that it had come near to spoiling all that was in the hearth. Then he took from the forge a hammer, put all the precious works into the hands of Brokkr his brother, and bade him go with them to &Aacute;sgard and claim the wager.</P>
<P>"Now when he and Loki brought forward the precious gifts, the &AElig;sir sat down in the seats of judgment; and that verdict was to prevail which Odin, Thor, and Freyr should render. Then Loki gave Odin the spear Gungnir, and to Thor the hair which Sif was to have, and Sk&iacute;dbladnir to Freyr, and told the virtues of all these things: that the spear would never stop in its thrust; the hair would grow to the flesh as soon as it came upon Sif's head; and Sk&iacute;dbladnir would have a favoring breeze as soon as the sail was raised, in whatsoever direction it might go, but could be folded together like a napkin and be kept in Freyr's pouch if he so desired. Then Brokkr brought forward his gifts: he gave to Odin the ring, saying that eight</P>
<P>{p. 147}</P>
<P>rings of the same weight would drop from it every ninth night; to Freyr he gave the boar, saying that it could run through air and water better than any horse, and it could never become so dark with night or gloom of the Murky Regions that there should not be sufficient light where be went, such was the glow from its mane and bristles. Then he gave the hammer to Thor, and said that Thor might smite as hard as he desired, whatsoever might be before him, and the hammer would not fail; and if he threw it at anything, it would never miss, and never fly so far as not to return to his hand; and if be desired, he might keep it in his sark, it was so small; but indeed it was a flaw in the hammer that the fore-haft was somewhat short.</P>
<P>"This was their decision: that the hammer was best of all the precious works, and in it there was the greatest defence against the Rime-Giants; and they gave sentence, that the dwarf should have his wager. Then Loki offered to redeem his head, but the dwarf said that there was no chance of this. 'Take me, then,' quoth Loki; but when Brokkr would have laid hands on him, he was a long way off. Loki had with him those shoes with which he ran through air and over water. Then the dwarf prayed Thor to catch him, and Thor did so. Then the dwarf would have hewn off his head; but Loki said that he might have the head, but not the neck. So the dwarf took a thong and a knife, and would have bored a hole in Loki's lips and stitched his mouth together, but the knife did not cut. Then Brokkr said that it would be better if his brother's awl were there: and even as he named it, the awl was there, and pierced the lips. He stitched the Ups together, and Loki ripped the thong out of the edges. That thong, with which Loki's mouth was sewn together, is called Vartari.</P>
<P>{p. 148}</P>
<P>XXXVI. "One may hear how gold is metaphorically called Fulla's Snood, in this verse which Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler wrought:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Fulla's shining Fillet,<BR>
The forehead's sun at rising,<BR>
Shone on the swelling shield-hill<BR>
For skalds all Hakon's life-days.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XXXVII. "Gold is called Freyja's Tears, as was said before. So sang Sk&uacute;li Thorsteinsson:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Many a fearless swordsman<BR>
Received the Tears of Freyja<BR>
The more the morn when foemen<BR>
We murdered; we were present.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Einarr Sk&uacute;lason sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Where, mounted 'twixt the carvings,<BR>
The Tear of Mard&ouml;ll lieth,<BR>
We bear the axe shield-splitting,<BR>
Swollen with Serpent's lair-gold.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And here Einarr has further periphrased Freyja so as to call her Mother of Hnoss, or Wife of &Oacute;dr, as standeth below:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The shield, tempest's strong roof-ice,<BR>
With tear-gold is unminished,<BR>
Eye-rain of &Oacute;dr's Bed-Mate:<BR>
His age the King so useth.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And again thus:</P>
<P>{p. 149}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>H&ouml;rn's Child, the glorious adornment,<BR>
I own, gold-wound--a jewel<BR>
Most fair--to the shield's rim<BR>
Fast is the golden Sea-Flame:<BR>
On the gem, Freyr's Niece, the tear-drift<BR>
Of the fore-head of her Mother<BR>
She bears; the Raven-Feeder<BR>
Gave me Fr&oacute;di's seed-gold's fostering.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>It is also recorded here that one may periphrase Freyja by calling her Sister of Freyr.</P>
<P>And thus also:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A defence of songs full goodly<BR>
He freely gave me, neighbor<BR>
Of sea-scales: I praise gladly<BR>
Nj&ouml;rdr's Daughter's golden gem-child.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here she is called Daughter of Nj&ouml;rdr.</P>
<P>And again thus:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The awesome Stately Urger<BR>
Of Odin, he who raises<BR>
The struggle stern, gave to me<BR>
The courage-stalwart daughter<BR>
Of the Vana-Bride, my fair axe;<BR>
The valorous sword-mote's Ruler<BR>
Led Gefn's girl to the Skald's bed,<BR>
Set with the sea-flame's gold-work.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here she is called Gefn and Bride of the Vanir.--It is proper to join 'tears' with all the names of Freyja, and</P>
<P>{p. 150}</P>
<P>to call gold by such terms; and in divers ways these periphrases have been varied, so that gold is called Hail, or Rain, or Snow-Storm, or Drops, or Showers, or Water falls, of Freyja's Eyes, or Cheeks, or Brows, or Eyelids.</P>
<P>XXXVIII. "In this place one may hear that gold is called Word, or Voice, of Giants, as we have said before; thus sang Bragi the Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then had I the third friend<BR>
Fairly praised: the poorest<BR>
In the Voice of the Botched-Knob's &Aacute;li,<BR>
But best of all to me.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>He called a rock Botched Knob, and a giant &Aacute;li of Rock, and gold Voice of the Giant.</P>
<P>XXXIX. "For what reason is gold called Otter's Wergild? It is related that when certain of the &AElig;sir, Odin and Loki and Hœnir, went forth to explore the earth, they came to a certain river, and proceeded along the river to a waterfall. And beside the fall was an otter, which had taken a salmon from the fall and was eating, blinking his eyes the while. Then Loki took up a stone and cast it at the otter, and struck its head. And Loki boasted in his catch, that he had got otter and salmon with one blow. Then they took up the salmon and the otter and bore them along with them, and coming to the buildings of a certain farm, they went in. Now the husbandman who dwelt there was named Hreidmarr: he was a man of much substance, and very skilled in black magic. The &AElig;sir asked him for a night's lodging, saying that they had sufficient food with them, and showed him</P>
<P>{p. 151}</P>
<P>their catch. But when Hreidmarr saw the otter, straight way he called to him his sons, F&aacute;fnir and Reginn, and told them that the otter their brother was slain, and who had done that deed.</P>
<P>It Now father and sons went up to the &AElig;sir, seized them, bound them, and told them about the otter, how he was Hreidmarr's son. The &AElig;sir offered a ransom for their lives, as much wealth as Hreidmarr himself desired to appoint; and a covenant was made between them on those terms, and confirmed with oaths. Then the otter was flayed, and Hreidmarr, taking the otter-skin, bade them fill the skin with red gold and also cover it altogether; and that should be the condition of the covenant between them. Thereupon Odin sent Loki into the Land of the Black Elves, and he came to the dwarf who is called Andvari, who was as a fish in the water. Loki caught him in his hands and required of him in ransom of his life all the gold that he had in his rock; and when they came within the rock, the dwarf brought forth all the gold he had, and it was very much wealth. Then the dwarf quickly swept under his hand one little gold ring, but Loki saw it and commanded him to give over the ring. The dwarf prayed him not to take the ring from him, saying that from this ring he could multiply wealth for himself if he might keep it. Loki answered that be should not have one penny left, and took the ring from him and went out; but the dwarf declared that that ring should be the ruin of every one who should come into possession of it. Loki replied that this seemed well enough to him, and that this condition should hold good provided that he himself brought it to the ears of them that should receive the ring and the curse. He went his way and came to Hreidmarr's dwelling, and showed the</P>
<P>{p. 152}</P>
<P>gold to Odin; but when Odin saw the ring, it seemed fair to him, and he took it away from the treasure, and paid the gold to Hreidmarr. Then Hreidmarr filled the otter-skin as much as he could, and set it up when it was full. Next Odin went up, having the skin to cover with gold, and he bade Hreidmarr look whether the skin were yet altogether hidden. But Hreidmarr looked at it searchingly, and saw one of the hairs of the snout, and commanded that this be covered, else their covenant should be at an end. Then Odin drew out the ring, and covered the hair, saying that they were now delivered from their debt for the slaying of the otter. But when Odin had taken his spear, and Loki his shoes, and they had no longer any need to be afraid, then Loki declared that the curse which Andvari had uttered should be fulfilled: that this ring and this gold should be the destruction of him who received it; and that was fulfilled afterward. Now it has been told wherefore gold is called Otter's Wergild, or Forced Payment of the &AElig;sir, or Metal of Strife.</P>
<P>XL. "What more is to be said of the gold? Hreidmarr took the gold for his son's wergild, but F&aacute;fnir and Reginn claimed some part of their brother's blood-money for themselves. Hreidmarr would not grant them one penny of the gold. This was the wicked purpose of those brethren: they slew their father for the gold. Then Reginn demanded that F&aacute;fnir share the gold with him, half for half. F&aacute;fnir answered that there was little chance of his sharing it with his brother, seeing that he had slain his father for its sake; and he bade Reginn go hence, else he should fare even as Hreidmarr. F&aacute;fnir had taken the helmet which Hreidmarr had possessed, and set it upon his head (this helmet was</P>
<P>{p. 153}</P>
<P>called the Helm of Terror, of which all living creatures that see it are afraid), and the sword called Hrotti. Reginn had that sword which was named Refill. So he fled away, and F&aacute;fnir went up to Gnita Heath, and made himself a lair, and turned himself into a serpent, and laid him down upon the gold.</P>
<P>"Then Reginn went to King Hj&aacute;lprekr at Thj&oacute;d, and there he became his smith; and he took into his fostering Sigurdr, son of Sigmundr, V&ouml;lsungr's son, and of Hj&ouml;rd&iacute;s, daughter of Eylimi. Sigurdr was. most illustrious of all Host-Kings in race, in prowess, and in mind. Reginn declared to him where F&aacute;fnir lay on the gold, and incited him to seek the gold. Then Reginn fashioned the sword Gramr, which was so sharp that Sigurdr, bringing it down into running water, cut asunder a flock of wool which drifted down-stream onto the sword's edge. Next Sigurdr clove Reginn's anvil down to the stock with the sword. After that they went, Sigurdr and Reginn, to Gnita Heath, and there Sigurdr dug a pit in F&aacute;fnr's way and laid him self in ambush therein. And when F&aacute;fnir glided toward the water and came above the pit, Sigurdr straightway thrust his sword through him, and that was his end.</P>
<P>"Then Reginn came forward, saying that Sigurdr had slain his brother, and demanded as a condition of reconciliation that he take F&aacute;fnir's heart and roast it with fire; and Reginn laid him down and drank the blood of F&aacute;fnir, and settled himself to sleep. But when Sigurdr was roasting the heart, and thought that it must be quite roasted, he touched it with his finger to see how hard it was; and then the juice ran out from the heart onto his finger, so that he was burned and put his finger to his mouth. As soon as the heart's blood came upon his tongue, straightway he knew the speech</P>
<P>{p. 154}</P>
<P>of birds, and he understood what the nuthatches were saying which were sitting in the trees. Then one spake:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There sits Sigurdr<BR>
Blood-besprinkled,<BR>
F&aacute;fnir's heart<BR>
With flame he roasteth:<BR>
Wise seemed to me<BR>
The Spoiler of Rings<BR>
If the gleaming<BR>
Life-fibre he ate.</P>
<P>There lies Reginn--sang another--<BR>
Rede he ponders,<BR>
Would betray the youth<BR>
Who trusteth in him:<BR>
In his wrath he plots<BR>
Wrong accusation;<BR>
The smith of bale<BR>
Would avenge his brother.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then Sigurdr went over to Reginn and slew him, and thence to his horse, which was named Grani, and rode till he came to F&aacute;fnir's lair. He took up the gold, trussed it up in his saddle-bags, laid it upon Grani's back, mounted up himself, and then rode his ways. Now the tale is told why gold is called Lair or Abode of F&aacute;fnir, or Metal of Gnita Heath, or Grani's Burden.</P>
<P>XLI. "Then Sigurdr rode on till he found a house on the mountain, wherein a woman in helm and birnie lay sleeping. He drew his sword and cut the birnie from her: she</P>
<P>{p. 155}</P>
<P>awoke then, and gave her name as Hildr: she is called Brynhildr, and was a Valkyr. Sigurdr rode away and came to the king who was named Gj&uacute;ki, whose wife was Gr&iacute;mhildr; their children were Gunnarr, H&ouml;gni, Gudr&uacute;n, Gudn&yacute;; Gotthormr was Gj&uacute;ki's stepson. Sigurdr tarried there a long time, and then he obtained the hand of Gudr&uacute;n, daughter of Gj&uacute;ki, and Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni swore oaths of blood brotherhood with Sigurdr. Thereafter Sigurdr and the sons of Gj&uacute;ki went unto Atli, Budli's son, to sue for the hand of Brynhildr his sister in marriage to Gunnarr. Brynhildr abode on Hinda-Fell, and about her hall there was a flaring fire; and she had made a solemn vow to take none but that man who should dare to ride through the flaring fire.</P>
<P>"Then Sigurdr and the sons of Gj&uacute;ki (who were also called Niflungs) rode up onto the mountain, and Gunnarr should have ridden through the flaring fire: but he had the horse named Goti, and that horse dared not leap into the fire. So they exchanged shapes, Sigurdr and Gunnarr, and names likewise; for Grani would go under no man but Sigurdr. Then Sigurdr leapt onto Grani, and rode through the flaring fire. That eve he was wedded with Brynhildr. But when they came to bed, he drew the Sword Gramr from its sheath and laid it between them. In the morning when he arose and clothed himself, he gave Brynhildr as linen-fee the same gold ring which Loki had taken from Andvari, and took another ring from her hand for remembrance. Then Sigurdr mounted his horse and rode to his fellows, and he and Gunnarr changed shapes again and went home to Gj&uacute;ki with Brynhildr. Sigurdr and Gudr&uacute;n had two children, Sigmundr and Svanhildr.</P>
<P>"It befell on a time that Brynhildr and Gudr&uacute;n went to the water to wash their hair. And when they came to the</P>
<P>{p. 156}</P>
<P>river, Brynhildr waded out from the bank well into the river, saying that she would not touch to her head the water which ran out of the hair of Gudr&uacute;n, since herself had the more valorous husband. Then Gudr&uacute;n went into the river after her and said that it was her right to wash her hair higher upstream, for the reason that she had to husband such a man as neither Gunnarr nor any other in the world matched in valor, seeing that he had slain F&aacute;fnir and Reginn and succeeded to the heritage of both. And Brynhildr made answer: 'It was a matter of greater worth that Gunnarr rode through the flaring fire and Sigurdr durst not.' Then Gudr&uacute;n laughed, and said: 'Dost thou think that Gunnarr rode through the flaring fire? Now I think that he who went into the bride-bed with thee was the same that gave me this gold ring; and the gold ring which thou bearest on thine hand and didst receive for linen-fee is called Andvari's Yield, and I believe that it was not Gunnarr who got that ring on Gnita Heath.' Then Brynhildr was silent, and went home.</P>
<P>"After that she egged on Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni to slay Sigurdr; but because they were Sigurdr's sworn blood-brothers, they stirred up Gotthormr their brother to slay him. He thrust his sword through Sigurdr as he slept; but when Sigurdr felt the wound, he hurled his sword Gramr after Gotthormr, so that it cut the man asunder at the middle. There fell Sigurdr and Sigmundr, his son of three winters, whom they slew. Then Brynhildr stabbed herself with a sword, and she was burned with Sigurdr; but Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni took F&aacute;fnir's heritage and Andvari's Yield, and ruled the lands thereafter.</P>
<P>"King Atli, Budli's son, and brother of Brynhildr, then wedded Gudr&uacute;n, whom Sigurdr had had to wife; and they</P>
<P>{p. 157}</P>
<P>had children. King Atli invited to him Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni, and they came at his invitation. Yet before they departed from their land, they hid the gold, F&aacute;fnir's heritage, in the Rhine, and that gold has never since been found. Now King Atli had a host in readiness, and fought with Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni; and they were made captive. King Atli bade . the heart be cut out of H&ouml;gni alive, and that was his end. Gunnarr he caused to be cast into a den of serpents. But a harp was brought secretly to Gunnarr, and he struck it with his toes, his hands being bound; he played the harp so that all the serpents fell asleep, saving only one adder, which glided over to him, and gnawed into the cartilage of his breast-bone so far that her head sank within the wound, and she clove to his liver till he died. Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni were called Niflungs and Gj&uacute;kungs, for which reason gold is called Treasure, or Heritage, of the Niflungs.</P>
<P>["A little while after, Gudr&uacute;n slew her two sons, and caused flagons to be made of their skulls, set with gold and silver. Then the funeral-feast was held for the Niflungs; and at this feast Gudr&uacute;n had mead poured into the flagons for King Atli, and the mead was mixed with the blood of the boys. Moreover, she caused their hearts to be roasted and set before the king, that he might eat of them. And when he had eaten, then she herself told him what she had done, with many scathing words. There was no lack of strong drink there, so that most of the company had fallen asleep where they sat. That night she went to the king while he slept, and H&ouml;gni's son with her; they smote the king, and that was the death of him. Then they set fire to the hall, and burned the folk that were within. After that she went to the shore and leaped into the sea, desiring to make</P>
<P>{p. 158}</P>
<P>an end of herself; but she was tossed by the billows over the firth, and was borne to King J&oacute;nakr's land. And when he saw her, he took her to him and wedded her, and they had three sons, called S&ouml;rli, Hamdir, and Erpr: they were all raven-black of hair, like Gunnarr and H&ouml;gni and the other Niflungs. There Svanhildr, daughter of the youth Sigurdr, was reared, and of all women she was fairest. King J&ouml;rmunrekkr the Mighty learned of her beauty, and sent his son Randv&eacute;r to woo her and bring her to be his wife. When Randv&eacute;r had come to the court of J&oacute;nakr, Svanhildr was given into his hands, and he should have! brought her to King J&ouml;rmunrekkr. But Earl Bikki said that it was a better thing for Randv&eacute;r to wed Svandhildr, since he and she were both young, whereas J&ouml;rmunrekkr was old. This counsel pleased the young folk well. Thereupon Bikki reported the matter to the king. Straightway, King J&ouml;rmunrekkr commanded that his son be seized and led to the gallows. Then Randv&eacute;r took his hawk and plucked off ins feathers, and bade that it be sent so to his father; after which he was hanged. But when King J&ouml;rmunrekkr saw the hawk, suddenly it came home to him that even as the hawk was featherless and powerless to fly, so was his kingdom shorn of its might, since he was old and childless. Then King J&ouml;rmunrekkr, riding out of the wood where he had been hunting, beheld Svanhildr as she sat washing her hair: they rode upon her and trod her to death under their horses' feet.</P>
<P>"But when Gudr&uacute;n learned of this, she urged on her sons to take vengeance for Svanhildr. When they were preparing for their journey, she gave them birnies and helmets so strong that iron could not bite into them. She laid these instructions upon them: that, when they were come to King J&ouml;rmunrekkr, they should go up to him by night as he slept:</P>
<P>{p. 159}</P>
<P>S&ouml;rli and Hamdir should hew off his hands and feet, and Erpr his head. But when they were on their way, they asked Erpr what help they might expect from him, if they met King J&ouml;rmunrekkr. He answered that he would render them such aid as the hand affords the foot. They said that that help which the foot received from the hand was altogether nothing. They were so wroth with their mother that she had sent them away with angry words, and they desired so eagerly to do what would seem worst to her, that they slew Erpr, because she loved him most of all. A little later, while S&ouml;rli was walking, one of his feet slipped, and he supported himself on his hand; and he said: 'Now the hand assists the foot indeed; it were better now that Erpr were living.' Now when they came to King J&ouml;rmunrekkr by night, where he was sleeping, and hewed hands and feet off him, he awoke and called upon his men, and bade them arise. And then Hamdir spake, saying: 'The head had been off by now, if Erpr lived.' Then the henchmen rose up and attacked them, but could not overmaster them with weapons; and J&ouml;rmunrekkr called out to them to beat them with stones, and it was done. There S&ouml;rli and Hamdir fell, and now all the house and offspring of Gj&uacute;ki were dead. A daughter named &Aacute;slaug lived after young Sigurdr; she was reared with Heimir in Hlymdalir, and great houses are sprung from her. It is said that Sigmundr, V&ouml;lsungr's son, was so strong that he could drink venom and receive no hurt; and Sinfj&ouml;tli his son and Sigurdr were so hard-skinned that no venom from without could harm them: wherefore Bragi the Skald has sung thus:</P><DIR>

</DIR>

<P>{p. 160}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>On the hook of the Foeman<BR>
Of Hill-Giants' kindred.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Most skalds have made verses and divers short tales from these sagas. Bragi the Old wrote of the fall of S&ouml;rli and Hamdir in that song of praise which he composed on Ragnarr Lodbr&oacute;k:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Once J&ouml;rmunrekkr awakened<BR>
To an dream, 'mid the princes<BR>
Blood-stained, while swords were swirling:<BR>
A brawl burst in the dwelling<BR>
Of Randv&eacute;r's royal kinsman,<BR>
When the raven-swarthy<BR>
Brothers of Erpr took vengeance<BR>
For all the bitter sorrows.</P>
<P>The bloody dew of corpses,<BR>
O'er the king's couch streaming,<BR>
Fell on the floor where, severed,<BR>
Feet and hands blood-dripping<BR>
Were seen; in the ale-cups' fountain<BR>
He fell headlong, gore-blended:<BR>
On the Shield, Leaf of the Bushes<BR>
Of Leifi's Land, 't is painted.</P>
<P>There stood the shielded swordsmen,<BR>
Steel biting not, surrounding<BR>
The king's couch; and the brethren<BR>
Hamdir and S&ouml;rli quickly<BR>
To the earth were beaten<BR>
By the prince's order,</P></DIR>

To ravish Svanhildr's lover;<BR>

<P>XLII. "Why is gold called Fr&oacute;di's Meal? This is the tale thereof: One of Odin's sons, named Skj&ouml;ldr,--from whom the Skj&ouml;ldungs are come,--had his abode and ruled in the realm which now is called Denmark, but then was known as Gotland. Skj&ouml;ldr's son, who ruled the land after him, was named Fridleifr. Fridleifr's son was Fr&oacute;di: he succeeded to the kingdom after his father, in the time when Augustus Caesar imposed peace on all the world; at that time Christ was born. But because Fr&oacute;di was mightiest of all kings in the Northern lands, the peace was called by his name wherever the Danish tongue was spoken; and men call it the Peace of Fr&oacute;di. No man injured any other, even though he met face to face his father's slayer or his brother's, loose or bound. Neither was there any thief nor robber then, so that a gold ring lay long on Jalangr's Heath. King Fr&oacute;di</P>
<P>{p. 162}</P>
<P>went to a feast in Sweden at the court of the king who was called Fj&ouml;lnir, and there he bought two maid-servants, Fenja and Menja: they were huge and strong. In that time two mill-stones were found in Denmark, so great that no one was so strong that he could turn them: the nature of the mill was such that whatsoever he who turned asked for, was ground out by the mill-stones. This mill was called Gr&oacute;tti. He who gave King Fr&oacute;di the mill was named Hengikj&ouml;ptr. King Fr&oacute;di had the maid-servants led to the mill, and bade them grind gold; and they did so. First they ground gold and, peace and happiness for Fr&oacute;di; then he would grant them rest or sleep no longer than the cuckoo held its peace or a song might be sung. It is said that they sang the song which is called the Lay of Gr&oacute;tti, and this is its beginning:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now are we come<BR>
To the king's house,<BR>
The two fore-knowing,<BR>
Fenja and Menja:<BR>
These are with Fr&oacute;di<BR>
Son of Fridleifr,<BR>
The Mighty Maidens,<BR>
As maid-thralls held.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And before they ceased their singing, they ground out a host against Fr&oacute;di, so that the sea-king called M&yacute;singr came there that same night and slew Fr&oacute;di, taking much plunder. Then the Peace of Fr&oacute;di was ended. M&yacute;singr took Gr&oacute;tti with him, and Fenja and Menja also, and bade them grind salt. And at midnight they asked whether M&yacute;singr were not weary of salt. He bade them grind longer. They had ground but a little while, when down sank the ship; and from that</P>
<P>{p. 163}</P>
<P>time there has been a whirlpool the sea where the water falls through the hole in the mill-stone. It was then that the sea became salt.</P>
<P>["The lay of Gr&oacute;tti:</P><DIR>

<P>XLIII. "Why is gold called Kraki's Seed? In Denmark there was a king called Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki: he was most renowned </P>
<P>{p. 170}</P>
<P>of all ancient kings for munificence, valor, and graciousness. One evidence of his graciousness which is often brought into stories is this: A little lad and poor, V&ouml;ggr by name, came into the hall of King Hr&oacute;lfr. At that time the king was young, and of slender stature. V&ouml;ggr came into his presence and looked up at him; and the king said: 'What wouldst thou say, lad, for thou lookest at me?' V&ouml;ggr answered: 'When I was at home, I heard say that Hr&oacute;lfr the king at Hleidr was the greatest man in the northern lands; but now there sitteth in the high seat a little pole, and he is called King.' Then the king made answer: 'Thou, boy, hast given me a name, so that I shall be called Hr&oacute;lfr the Pole (Kraki); and it is the custom that the giving of a name be accompanied by a gift. Now I see that with the name which thou has fastened on me, thou hast no gift such as would be acceptable to me, wherefore he that has wherewith to give shall give to the other.' And he took from his hand a gold ring and gave it to him. Then V&ouml;ggr said: 'Above all kings be thou most blessed of givers! Now I swear an oath that I shall be that man's slayer who slays thee.' Then spake the king, laughing loudly: 'V&ouml;ggr is pleased with a small thing.'</P>
<P>"Another example is the tale told concerning the valor of Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki: That king whom men call Adils ruled over Uppsala; he had to wife Yrsa, mother of Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki. He was at strife with the king who ruled over Norway, whose name was Ali; the two joined battle on the ice of the lake called Vaeni. King Adils sent an embassy to Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki, his stepson, praying him to come to his aid, and promised wages to all his host so long as they should be away; King Hr&oacute;lfr himself should have three precious gifts, whatsoever three he might choose from all Sweden. {p. 171} King Hr&oacute;lfr could not make the journey in person, owing to the strife in which he was engaged with the Saxons; but he sent to Adils his twelve berserks: B&ouml;dvar-Bjarki was there for one, and Hjalti the Stout-Hearted, Hv&iacute;tserkr the Stern, V&ouml;ttr V&eacute;seti, and the brethren Svipdagr and Beigudr. In that battle King &Aacute;li fell, and the great part of his host with him; and King Adils took from him in death the helm Battle-Swine and his horse Raven. Then the berserks of Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki demanded for their hire three pounds of gold for each man of them; and in addition they required that they might bear to Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki those gifts of price which they had chosen for him: which were the Helm Battle-Boar and the birnie Finn's Heritage,--on neither of which iron would take hold,--and the gold ring which was called Pig of the Swedes, which Adils' forefathers had had. But the king denied them all these things, nor did he so much as pay their hire: the berserks went away ill-pleased with their share, and told the state of things to Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki.</P>
<P>"Straightway he begin his journey to Uppsala; and when he had brought his ships into the river F&yacute;ri, he rode at once to Uppsala, and his twelve berserks with him, all without safe-conduct. Yrsa, his mother, welcomed him and led him to lodgings, but not to the king's hall: fires were made there before them, and ale was given them to drink. Then men of King Adils came in and heaped firewood onto the fire, and made it so great that the clothes were burnt off Hr&oacute;lfr and his men. And the fellows spake: 'Is it true that Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki and his berserks shun neither fire nor iron?' Then Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki leapt up, and all they that were with him; and he said:</P>
<P>{p. 172}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Add we to the fire<BR>
In Adils' dwelling!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>took his shield and cast it onto the fire, and leapt over the flames, while the shield burnt; and he spake again:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'He flees not the flames<BR>
Who o'er the fire leapeth!'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Even so did his men, one after another; and they laid hands on those fellows who had heaped up the fire, and cast them into the flames. Then Yrsa came and gave Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki a deer's horn full of gold, the ring Pig of the Swedes being with the gold; and she bade them ride away to the host. They vaulted onto their horses and rode down into the Plain of the F&yacute;ri; and soon they saw King Adils riding after them with his host all in armor, hoping to slay them. Then Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki plunged his right hand down into the horn, grasped the gold, and strewed it all about the road. When the Swedes saw that, they leapt down out of their saddles, and each took up as much as he could lay hold of; but King Adils bade them ride on, and himself rode furiously . His horse was called Sl&ouml;ngvir, swiftest of all horses. Then Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki saw that King Adils was drawing close up to him, took the ring, Pig of the Swedes, and threw it toward him, and bade him receive it as a gift. King Adils rode at the ring and thrust at it with his spear-point, and let it slide down over the shaft-socket. Then Hr&oacute;lfr Kraki turned back and saw how he bent down, and spake: 'Now I have made him who is mightiest of Swedes stoop as a swine stoops.' Thus they parted. For this cause gold is called Seed of Kraki or of F&yacute;ri's Plain. Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler:</P>
<P>{p. 173}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>God of the blade of battle,<BR>
We bear through H&aacute;kon's life-days<BR>
The Seed of F&yacute;ri's valley<BR>
On our arms, where sits the falcon.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Even as Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The king sows the bright seed-corn<BR>
Of knuckle-splendid gold rings,<BR>
With the crop of Yrsa's offspring,<BR>
In his company's glad hand-grasp;<BR>
The guileless 'Land-Director<BR>
With Kraki's gleaming barley<BR>
Sprinkles my arms, the flesh-grown<BR>
Seat of the hooded falcon.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XLIV. "It is said that the king called H&ouml;lgi, from whom H&aacute;logaland is named, was the father of Thorgerdr H&ouml;lgabr&uacute;dr; sacrifice was made to both of them, and a cairn was raised over H&ouml;lgi: one layer of gold or silver (that was the sacrificial money), and another layer of mould and stones. Thus sang Sk&uacute;li Thorsteinsson:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When I reddened Reifnir's Roof-Bane,<BR>
The ravening sword, for wealth's sake<BR>
At Sv&ouml;ldr, I heaped with gold rings<BR>
Warlike H&ouml;lgi's cairn-thatch.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In the ancient <I>Bjarkam&aacute;l</I> many terms for gold are told: it says there:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The king most gift-gracious<BR>
His guardsmen enriched</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 174}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With Fenja's Labor,<BR>

Grani's fair Burden,<BR>
Draupnir's dear dripping,<BR>
Down of Grafvitnir.</P>
<P>The free-handed Lord gave,<BR>
The heroes accepted,<BR>
Sif's firm-grown tresses,<BR>
Ice of the bow-force,<BR>
Otter-gild unwilling,<BR>
Weeping of Mard&ouml;ll,<BR>
Fire-flame of &Oacute;run,<BR>

The leader war-daring,<BR>
Warded Baldr not.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XLV. Gold is metaphorically termed Fire of the Hand, or of the Limb, or of the Leg, because it is red; but silver is called Snow, or Ice, or Hoar-Frost, because it is white. In like manner, gold or silver may be periphrased in metaphors of purse, or crucible, or lather, and both silver and gold may be called Hand-Stone, or Necklace, of any man who was</P>
<P>{p. 175}</P>
<P>wont to have a necklace. Necklaces and rings are both silver and gold, if no other distinction is raised.</P>
<P>As Thorleikr the Fair sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The kindly Prince the Load casts<BR>
Of Crucibles on the Hawk-Seats<BR>
Of thanes, the wrists embellished,--<BR>
Gives Embers of the Arm-joint.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The land-strong King of Lurid<BR>
Breaks the golden Limb-Brands;<BR>
I think the Prince of Warriors<BR>
Lacks not the Rhine's bright Pebbles.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Einarr Sk&uacute;lason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Purse-Snow and the Sea-Fire<BR>
Lie on both sides of the axe-head<BR>
Blood-spilling; 't is my office<BR>
To praise our foemen's Scather.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as he sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Sea-Glow each day standeth<BR>
O'er the Crucible's white Snow-Drift,<BR>
And the shield, ships' cheeks protecting,<BR>
Shelters a heart most lavish;<BR>
Ne'er can one melt the silver<BR>
Flagon-Snow in the Fire-Flame<BR>
Of the Eel's Stream-Road; the Feller<BR>
Of Hosts all feats performeth.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>176</P>
<P>Here gold is called Fire of the Eel's Stream-Road; and silver, Snow of Flagons.</P>
<P>Thus sang Th&oacute;rdr M&aelig;ri's Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The glad Giver of the Hand-Waste<BR>
Of the Gold-Minisher perceiveth<BR>
That the Herm&oacute;dr of the Snake's Lair<BR>
Hath had a lordly father.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XLVI. "Man is called Breaker of Gold, even as &Oacute;ttarr the Swarthy sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I needs must use the Breaker<BR>
Of the Battle-Glow of good men;<BR>
Here is the watch war-doughty<BR>
Of the Wise King assembled.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Or Gold-Sender, as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Sender of Gold permitteth<BR>
The silent earth to hearken<BR>
To song; his gifts I gather:<BR>
The prince his young men gladdens.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Gold-Caster, as Thorleikr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Gold-Caster makes loyal to him<BR>
His guard with kingly armor.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Gold's Adversary, as sang Thorvaldr Blending-Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The gold's foe Hot Coals casteth<BR>
Of the Arm; the king gives red wealth;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 177}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The vile folk's Desolator<BR>
Dispenseth the Freight of Grani.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Gold-Towerer, as is written here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Gold-Towerer in friendship<BR>
I got, and of the Warrior,<BR>
Son of the glowing War-Blade,<BR>
I make a song of praise.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Woman is periphrased in metaphors of gold, being called Willow or Giver of Gold, as Hallarsteinn sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He who casts the Amber<BR>
Of Vidblindi's Boar's cool, salt Drink,<BR>
Long will recall the Willow<BR>
Of the Reed-Snake's golden River.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here the whale is called Boar of Vidblindi; this Vidblindi was a giant who drew whales out of the sea like fishes. The Drink of Whales is the sea; Amber of the Sea is gold; woman is the Willow, or Dealer, of that gold which she gives; and the willow is a tree. Therefore, as is already shown, woman is periphrased with all manner of feminine tree-names: she is also called User of that which she gives; and the word for 'user' also signifies a log, the tree which falls in the forest.</P>
<P>Thus sang Gunnlaugr Serpent's-Tongue:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>That dame was born to stir strife<BR>
Among the sons of men-folk;<BR>
The War-Bush caused that; madly<BR>
I yearned to have the Wealth-Log.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 178}</P>
<P>Woman is called Forest; so sang Hallarsteinn:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With the well-trained Plane of Singing,<BR>
The tongue, I have planed, my Lady,<BR>
Dame of the First Song's ale-vats,<BR>
Forest fair of Flagons.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Fagot, as Steinn sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thou shalt, O fresh Sif-Tender<BR>
Of the Flood's gold Fire, like other<BR>
Fagots of Hjadnings' gravel,<BR>
Break with thy good fortune.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Prop, as Ormr Steinth&oacute;rsson sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Prop of Stone was cloth&egrave;d<BR>
In garments clean and seemly:<BR>
A new cloak did the hero<BR>
Cast o'er the Mead's bright Valkyr.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Post, as Steinarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>All my dreams of the gracious Goddess<BR>
Of the bracelet-girded soft arms<BR>
Have lied to me; the Stream-Moon's<BR>
Unsteadfast Prop beguiled me.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Birch, as Ormr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>For a mark of the Birch<BR>
Of the bright hollow ring,<BR>
The palm-flame, I laid<BR>
On the dwarf-flagon, my song.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 179}</P>
<P>Oak, even as stands here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The fair shaped Oak of Riches<BR>
Stands, our mirth forestalling.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Linden, even as is written here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>O dreadful, towering Elm-Tree<BR>
Of the dinning shower of weapons,<BR>
Our courage shall not lessen:<BR>
So bade the Linen's Linden.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Man is periphrased in tree-metaphors, as we have written before; he is called Rowan, or Tester, of Weapons, or of Combats, of Expeditions and of Deeds, of Ships, and of all that which he wields and tests; thus sang &Uacute;lfr Uggason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But the flashing-eyed stiff Edge-Rope<BR>
Of the Earth stared past the gunwale<BR>
At the Rowan-Tree of the people<BR>
Of Stone, the Giant-Tester.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Tree and Beam, as Korm&aacute;kr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Beam of the murdering Sword-Twig<BR>
Is taller than are many<BR>
In the Din of Darts; the sword wins.<BR>
The land for dauntless Sigurdr.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Grove, as sang Hallfredr Troublous-Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Mighty Grove and Faithful<BR>
Of the Shield-Murderer, budded</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 180}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With hair, stands in the Eastlands<BR>
Safe with Ullr's Ash-Warriors.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here he is also called Ash.</P>
<P>Box, as Arn&oacute;rr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Box of Ships bade the Rygir<BR>
Bring the shields together<BR>
At early dusk; through the spear-rain<BR>
Of strife-clouds held the autumn night.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Ash, as Refr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Strife-Lord, gracious Giver,<BR>
Sought the Maid's bed gold-sprinkled;<BR>
The Ash of Odin's War-Sleet<BR>
Won the estate of manhood.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Maple, as here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Hail, Maple of the Ice-Lumps<BR>
Of the Hand!' So spake the Birnie.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Tree, as Refr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Since I have appointed<BR>
To proffer Odin's Breast-Sea,<BR>
The War-God's Verse, to Thorsteinn;<BR>
The Tree of Swords so wills it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Staff, as &Oacute;ttarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thou, fierce War-Staff, maintainedst<BR>
Maugre two kings, thy borders</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 181}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With heroes' kin, where the ravens<BR>
Starved not; keen-hearted art thou.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thorn, as Arn&oacute;rr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He gathered, the young Wealth-Thorn,<BR>
Many great heaps of corpses<BR>
For the eagles, and his henchmen<BR>
Guided and helped the hero.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XLVII. "How should battle be periphrased? By calling it Storm of Weapons or of Sheltering Shields, or of Odin or the Valkyrs, or of Host-Kings; and Din and Clashing.</P>
<P>Thus sang Hornklofi:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The king hath held a Spear-Storm<BR>
With heroes, where the eagles<BR>
Screamed at the Din of Sk&ouml;gul;<BR>
The red wounds spat out blood.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Eyvindr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And that hero<BR>
At H&aacute;ar's Tempest<BR>
Wore a sark<BR>
Of gray wolf-skin.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Bersi:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In earlier days I seemed not<BR>
To Gunn's War-Bushes useful<BR>
In the Sleet of Hl&ouml;kk, when younger<BR>
We were: so 't is said.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 182}</P>
<P>Thus sang Einarr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The stark prince lets Hildr's Shield-Sails<BR>
Take the sternest crashing Storm-Wind<BR>
Of the Valkyr, where hail of bow-strings<BR>
Drives; the sword-blade hammers.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The mail-sarks of the warriors,<BR>
Firm-woven, did not shelter<BR>
The seemly youths 'gainst H&ouml;gni's<BR>
Showers of H&aacute;kon's onset.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Even as here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>They set the Point-Net's edge-band<BR>
Against the Point-Crash-Urger.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And again:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Neath eagles' claws the king's foes<BR>
Sank at the Clash of G&ouml;ndul.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XLVIII. "Weapons and armor should be periphrased in figures of battle, and with reference to Odin and the Valkyrs and host-kings: one should call a helmet Cowl, or Hood; a birnie, Sark, or Kirtle; a shield, Tent; and a shield-wall is termed Hall and Roof, Wall and Floor. Shields, periphrased in figures of warships, are called Sun, or Moon, or Leaf, or Sheen, or Garth, of the Ship; the shield is also called Ship of Ullr, or periphrased in terms of Hrungnir's feet, since he stood upon his shield. On ancient shields it</P>
<P>{p. 183}</P>
<P>was customary to paint a circle, which was called the 'ring,' and shields are called in metaphors of that ring. Hewing weapons, axes or swords, are called Fires of Blood, or of Wounds; swords are called Odin's Fires; but men call axes by the names of troll-women, and periphrase them in terms of blood or wounds or a forest or wood. Thrusting weapons are properly periphrased by calling them by names of serpents or fishes. Missile weapons are often metaphorically termed hail or sleet or storm. Variants of all these figures have been made in many ways, for they are used chiefly in poems of praise, where there is need of such metaphors.</P>
<P>So sang V&iacute;ga-Gl&uacute;mr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With the Hanged-God's helmet<BR>
The hosts have ceased from going<BR>
By the brink; not pleasant<BR>
The bravest held the venture.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Einarr Tinkling-Scale:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Helm-folded strife-bold B&uacute;i,--<BR>
Who from the south went forth<BR>
Into Gunn's Crash,--and din-swift<BR>
Sigvaldi offered battle.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Sark of R&oacute;di, as Tindr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When came the birnied H&aacute;kon<BR>
To cast away the ring-rent<BR>
Streaming Sark of Odin,<BR>
R&oacute;di's rocking sea-steeds were cleared.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 184}</P>
<P>Hamdir's Kirtle, as Hallfredr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The war-sleet hard and streaming<BR>
Of Egill's weapons breaketh<BR>
Fiercely on Hamdir's Kirtles<BR>
Of the foremost wave-deer's warriors.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>S&ouml;rli's Garments, as he sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thence the bright Weeds of S&ouml;rli<BR>
In men's blood must be reddened;<BR>
I hear it clearly: Wound-Fire<BR>
In cutting showers of iron.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Shields are called Tents of Hl&ouml;kk, as Grett&iacute;r sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Hl&ouml;kk's Tent-Raisers held their noses<BR>
Together, and the heroes<BR>
Of the Rain-Storm of Hildr's Shield-Wall<BR>
Hewed at each other's beards.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>R&oacute;di's Roof, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>R&oacute;di's Roof's great Ice-Lump<BR>
For the Rain of Freyja's Eyelids<BR>
Grows not less, my fair axe-head;<BR>
His age my lord so useth.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Wall of Hildr, as Grett&iacute;r sang, and as we have written before.</P>
<P>Ship-Sun, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In the sea &Oacute;lafr's Kinsman<BR>
Reddens the flame of the Ship-Sun.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 185}</P>
<P>Moon of the Ship's Cheek, as Refr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Fair was the day, when Scatterers<BR>
Of Arm-Fire thrust the clear Moon<BR>
Of the Cheek into my hand-clasp,<BR>
The coiling track of red rings.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Ship's Garth, as here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The swift Sweller of the Spear-Crash<BR>
Shot through the stain-dyed Prow-Garth<BR>
As it were birch-bark; truly<BR>
He was a bitter battler.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Ash of Ullr, as here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Snow-Gusts of Ullr's Ash-Ship<BR>
Grimly o'er our Prince shoot<BR>
With fullness, where are tossing<BR>
The fearsome covered spike-spars.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Blade of Hrungnir's Foot-Soles, as Bragi sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Wilt hear, O Hrafnketill,<BR>
How I shall praise the Sole-Blade<BR>
Of Thr&uacute;dr's thief, stain-covered<BR>
With skill, and praise my king.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Bragi the Skald sang this concerning the ring on the shield:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Unless it be, that Sigurdr's<BR>
Renowned Son would have payment<BR>
In good kind for the ring-nave<BR>
Of the Ringing Wheel of Hildr.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 186}</P>
<P>He called the shield Wheel of Hildr, and the ring the Nave of the Wheel.</P>
<P>Ring-Earth, as Hallvardr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Chief of ranks of Combat<BR>
Sees the red-gleaming Ring-Earth<BR>
Fly in two parts; the white disk,<BR>
The pictured, bursts in sunder.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>It is also sung:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A ring befits the shield best;<BR>
Arrows befit the bow.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A sword is Odin's Fire, as Korm&aacute;kr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The fight swelled, when the Warrior,<BR>
The Wolf's blithe Feeder, in tumult<BR>
Fared with Odin's ringing Fire-Flame;<BR>
Urdr came forth from the Well.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Fire of the Helm, as &Uacute;lfr Uggason sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The very mighty Maiden<BR>
Of the Mountain made the Sea-Horse<BR>
Roll forward, but the Champions<BR>
Of Odin's Helm-Fire felled her Wolf-Steed.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Fire of the Birnie, as Gl&uacute;mr Geirason sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>At that the Land-Protector<BR>
Let the Birnie's Streaming Fire whine,<BR>
Hone-whetted, he who warded<BR>
Him strongly 'gainst the warriors.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 187}</P>
<P>Ice of the Rim, and Hurt of Sheltering Weapons, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I received the Ice of Wed Rims,<BR>
With Freyja's golden Eye-Thaw,<BR>
From the upright prince high-hearted;<BR>
We bear in hand the Helm's Hurt.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>An axe is called Troll-Woman of Sheltering Weapons, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>R&aelig;fill's Sea-Steed's Riders<BR>
May see how, richly carven,<BR>
The dragons close are brooding<BR>
'Gainst the brow of the Helm-Ogress.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A spear is called Serpent, as Refr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>My angry Murky Serpent<BR>
Of the markings of the Shield-Board<BR>
Savagely doth sport, in<BR>
My palms, where men in strife meet.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Arrows are called Hail of the Bow or Bowstring, or of the<BR>
Shelters, or of Battle, as Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The hammering King of Swords shook<BR>
From the Sails of Hl&ouml;kk the Bow-Hail:<BR>
Bravely the Wolf's Supporter<BR>
Warded his life in battle.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And Hallfredr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And the armor of the Spear-Sleet,<BR>
Knitted with iron, saved not</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 188}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The saters of hungry ravens<BR>
From the Shaft-Hail of the Bowstring.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And Eyvindr Skald- Despoiler:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>They said, O H&ouml;rds' Land-Warder,<BR>
Thy spirit little faltered,<BR>
When the Birnie's Hail in the wound burst;<BR>
Bent were the string&egrave;d elm-bows.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>XLIX. "Battle is called Storm or Snow-Shower of the Hjadnings, and weapons are termed Fire or Wands of Hjadnings; and this is the tale thereof: that king who was called H&ouml;gni had a daughter named Hildr: her King Hedinn, son of Hjarrandi, took as the spoils of war, while King H&ouml;gni attended an assembly of kings. But when he learned that there had been raiding in his realm and his daughter had been borne off, he departed with his host to seek Hedinn, and heard tidings of him, that he was proceeding northward along the land. When H&ouml;gni had come into Norway, he learned that Hedinn had sailed westward over the sea. Then H&ouml;gni sailed after him, even to the Orkneys; and when he landed at the place called Hoy, Hedinn was already there before him with his host. Then Hildr went to meet her father, and offered him a necklace on Hedinn's behalf, for reconciliation and peace; but if it were not accepted, she said, Hedinn was ready to fight, and H&ouml;gni might hope for no mercy at his hands.</P>
<P>"H&ouml;gni answered his daughter harshly; and when she returned to Hedinn, she told him that H&ouml;gni desired no reconciliation, and she bade him make ready for battle. So did both parties: they went to the island and marshalled</P>
<P>{p. 189}</P>
<P>their hosts. Then Hedinn called to H&ouml;gni his father-in-law, offering him reconciliation and much gold in compensation. But H&ouml;gni answered: 'Thou hast made this offer over-late, if thou wouldst make peace: for now I have drawn D&aacute;insleif, which the dwarves made, and which must cause a man's death every time it is bared, nor ever fails in its stroke; moreover, the wound heals not if one be scratched with it.' Then said Hedinn: 'Thou dost boast in the sword, but not in the victory; I call any sword good which is faithful to its lord.' Then they began that famous battle which is called the Hjadnings' Strife, and they fought all that day, but at evening the kings went to their ships. Now Hildr went to the slain by night, and with magic quickened all those that were dead. The next day the kings went to the battlefield and fought, and so did all those that had fallen on the day before. So the fight went one day after the other: all who fell, and all those weapons which lay on the field, and the shields also, were turned to stone; but when day dawned, up rose all the dead men and fought, and all weapons were renewed. It is said in songs that in this fashion the Hjadnings shall continue unto the Weird of the Gods. Bragi the Skald composed verses after this tale in Ragnarr Lodbr&oacute;k's <I>Song of Praise</I>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And the belov&egrave;d Maiden<BR>
Of the veins' blood-letting<BR>
Purposed to bring, for wrath's sake,<BR>
The bow-storm to her father:<BR>
When the ring-wearing lady,<BR>
The woman full of evil,<BR>
Bore the neck-ring of War-Doom<BR>
To the Battler of the Wind's Steeds.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 190}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>That gory Wound-Amender<BR>
To the glorious Monarch offered<BR>
The necklace not for fear's sake,<BR>
At the mote of fatal weapons:<BR>
Ever as restraining battle<BR>
She seemed, although she goaded<BR>
Warriors to walk the death-road<BR>
With the ravening Wolf's dire Sister.</P>
<P>The Prince of Folk, the Land-God,<BR>
Let not the fight, wolf-gladdening,<BR>
Halt, nor slaughter on the sands cease,--<BR>
Hate, deadly, swelled in H&ouml;gni,<BR>
When the stern Lords of Sword-Din<BR>
Sought Hedinn with stern weapons,<BR>
Rather than receive<BR>
The necklet-rings of Hildr.</P>
<P>And that baleful Witch of Women,<BR>
Wasting the fruits of victory,<BR>
Took governance on the island<BR>
O'er the axe, the Birnie's Ruin;<BR>
All the Ship-King's war-host<BR>
Went wrathful 'neath the firm shields<BR>
Of Hjarrajidi, swift-marching<BR>
From Reifnir's fleet sea-horses.</P>
<P>On the fair shield of Sv&ouml;lnir<BR>
One may perceive the onslaught;<BR>
Ragnarr[1] gave me the Ship-Moon,<BR>
With many tales marked on it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See page 161.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 191}</P>
<P>Battle is called Storm of Odin, as is recorded above; so sang V&iacute;ga-Gl&uacute;mr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I cleared my way aforetime<BR>
Like earls to lands; the word went<BR>
Of this among the Storm-Staves,<BR>
The men of Vidrir's Sword-Wand.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here battle is called Storm of Vidrir, and the sword is the Wand of Battle; men are Staves of the Sword. Here, then, both battle and weapons are used to make metaphors for man. It is called 'inlaying,' when one writes thus.</P>
<P>"The shield is the Land of Weapons, and weapons are Hail or Rain of that land, if one employs figures of later coinage.</P>
<P>L. "How should the ship be periphrased? Call it Horse or Deer or Snowshoe of the Sea-King, or of Ship's Rigging, or of Storm. Steed of the Billow, as Hornklofi sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Counsel-Stern Destroyer<BR>
Of the pale Steed of the Billow<BR>
When full young let the ships' prows<BR>
Press on the sea at flood-tide.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Geitir's Steed, as Erringar-Steinn sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>But though to the skald all people<BR>
This strife from the south are telling,<BR>
We shall yet load Geitir's Sea-Steed<BR>
With stone; we voyage gladly.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 192}</P>
<P>Sveidi's Reindeer:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>O Son of Sveinn strife-valiant,<BR>
Thou comest with Sveidi's Reindeer,<BR>
Long of seam, on the Seat of S&ouml;lsi;<BR>
The Sound-Deer from land glided.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>So sang Hallvardr. Here the ship is also called Deer of the Sound; and the Sea is called S&ouml;lsi's Seat.</P>
<P>Thus sang Th&oacute;rdr Sj&aacute;reksson:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The swift Steed of the Gunwale<BR>
Around Sigg veered from northward,<BR>
The gust shoved Gylfi's Stream's Mirth,<BR>
The Gull's Wake-Horse, to southward<BR>
Of Aumar, laying fleetly<BR>
Both K&ouml;rmt and Agdir's coastline<BR>
Along the stern; by Listi<BR>
The Leek's Steed lightly bounded.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here the ship is called Steed of the Gunwale; and the sea is Gylfi's Land; the sea is also called Gull's Wake. The ship is called Horse, and further, Horse of the Leek: for 'leek' means 'mast.'</P>
<P>And again, as Mark&uacute;s sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Stream's Winterling waded<BR>
Stoutly the Firth-Snake's Snow-Heaps;<BR>
The Tusker of the Mast-Head<BR>
Leaped o'er the Whale's spurned House-Tops;<BR>
The Bear of the Flood strode forward<BR>
On the ancient paths of sea-ships;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 193}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Stay's Bear, shower-breasting.<BR>
Broke the Reef's splashing Fetter.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here the ship is called Winterling of the Stream: a bear cub is called a Winterling; and a bear is called Tusker; the Bear of the Stay is a ship.</P>
<P>The ship is also called Reindeer, and so Hallvardr sang, as we have written before; and Hart, as King Haraldr Sigurdarson sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>By Sicily then widely<BR>
The Seam cut: we were stately;<BR>
The Sea-Hart glided swiftly<BR>
As we hoped beneath the heroes.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And Elk, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The ring's mild Peace-Dispenser,<BR>
The princely hero, may not<BR>
Long bide with thee, if something<BR>
Aid not; we boune the Flood's Elk.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And Otter, as M&aacute;ni sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>What, laggard carle with gray cheeks,<BR>
Canst do among keen warriors<BR>
On the Otter of the Sea-Waves?<BR>
For thy strength is ebbing from thee.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Wolf, as Refr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>And the Hoard-Diminisher hearkened<BR>
To Thorsteinn; true my heart is</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 194}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To the Lord of the Wolf of Billows<BR>
In the baleful Wrath-Wand's conflict.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And Ox also. The ship is called Snowshoe, or Wagon, or Wain. Thus sang Eyj&oacute;lfr the Valiant Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Late in the day the young Earl<BR>
In the Snowshoe of Landless Waters<BR>
Fared with equal following<BR>
To meet the fearless chieftain.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Styrk&aacute;rr Oddason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>H&ouml;gni's host drove the Wagons<BR>
Of Rollers o'er Heiti's snow-Heaps,<BR>
Angrily pursuing<BR>
The great Giver of Flood-Embers.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Thorbj&ouml;rn sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Freighter of Wave-Crests' Sea-Wain<BR>
Was in the font of christening,<BR>
Hoard-Scatterer, who was given<BR>
The White Christ's highest favor.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>LI. "How should one periphrase Christ? Thus: by calling Him Fashioner of Heaven and Earth, of Angels, and of the Sun; Governor of the World and of the Heavenly Kingdom and of Jerusalem and Jordan and the Land of the Greeks; Counsellor of the Apostles and of the Saints. Ancient skalds have written of Him in metaphors of Urdr's Well and Rome; as Eil&iacute;fr Gudr&uacute;narson sang:</P>
<P>{p. 195}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>So has Rome's Mighty Ruler<BR>
In the Rocky Realms confirm&egrave;d<BR>
His power; they say He sitteth<BR>
South, at the Well of Urdr.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Skapti Th&oacute;roddssen:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The King of Monks is greatest<BR>
Of might, for God all governs;<BR>
Christ's power wrought this earth all,<BR>
And raised the Hall of Rome.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>King of the Heavens, as Mark&uacute;s sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The King of the Wind-House fashioned<BR>
Earth, sky, and faithful peoples;<BR>
Christ, sole Prince of Mortals,<BR>

</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Eil&iacute;fr K&uacute;lnasveinn:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Host of the beaming World's Roof<BR>
And the Band of Illustrious bow down<BR>
To the Holy Cross; than all glory<BR>
Else the Sole Sun's King is brighter.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Son of Mary, as Eil&iacute;fr sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The bright Host of Heaven boweth<BR>
To Mary's Bairn: He winneth,<BR>
The Gentle Prince, of glory<BR>
The true might, God and man both.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 196}</P>
<P>King of Angels, as Eil&iacute;fr sang again:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The goodly might of God's friend<BR>
Is better than men guess of;<BR>
Yet the Gracious King of Angels<BR>
Is dearer than all, and holier.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>King of Jordan, as Sigvatr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Four angels the King of Jordan<BR>
Sent long ago through aether<BR>
To earthward; and the stream washed<BR>
The holy head of the World's Lord.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>King of Greeks, as Arn&oacute;rr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I have lodged for the hero's ashes<BR>
Prayers with the Lordly Warder<BR>
Of Greeks and men of Gardar:<BR>
Thus I pay my Prince for good gifts.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Eil&iacute;fr K&uacute;lnasveinn:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Glory of Heaven praises<BR>
Man's Prince: He is King of all things.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here he called Christ, first, King of Men, and again, King of All. E&iacute;narr Sk&uacute;lason sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He who compasseth, Bright in Mercy,<BR>
All the world, and gently careth<BR>
For all, caused the realm of Heaven<BR>
To ope for the valiant ruler.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 197}</P>
<P>LII. "There the metaphors coincide; and he who interprets the language of poesy learns to distinguish which king is meant; for it is correct to call the Emperor of Constantinople King of Greeks, and similarly to call the king who rules over the land of Jerusalem King of Jerusalem, and also to call the Emperor of Rome King of Rome, and to call him King of Angles' who governs England. But that periphrasis which was cited but now, which called Christ King of Men, may be had by, every king. It is proper to periphrase all kings by calling them Land-Rulers, or Land-Warders, or Land-Attackers, or Leader of Henchmen, or Warder of the People.</P>
<P>Thus sang Eyvindr Skald-Despoiler:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Who filled the ravens<BR>
From life was reft<BR>
By the Earth-Rulers<BR>
At &Ouml;gl&oacute;.[1]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Gl&uacute;mr Geirason sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Prince beneath the helmet<BR>
Reddened the sword hone-hollowed<BR>
On the Geats: there the Land-Warder<BR>
Was found in the grinding spear-din.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'T is my wish that the glorious Leader<BR>
Of Henchmen, the Glad-hearted,<BR>
Should leave his sons the heritage<BR>
And the sod of his fair freehold.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The reverse of Gregory's pun: "Non Angli sed angeli."</P>
<P>2. See page 98.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 198}</P>
<P>As Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The valiant-souled Earth-Warder<BR>
On his stern head the helm bears;<BR>
The bard before heroes telleth<BR>
The fame of the King of H&ouml;rdland.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>It is right also to call him King of Kings, under whom are tributary kings. An emperor is highest of kings, and next under him is that king who reigns over a nation; and each of these is equal to the other in the periphrases made of them in poesy. Next to them are those men who are called earls or tributary kings: and they are equal in periphrasis with a king, save that one may not term them kings of nations. And thus sang Arn&oacute;rr Earl's Skald concerning Earl Thorfinnr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Let the men hear how the Earl's King,<BR>
Hardy of mind, the sea sought:<BR>
The overwhelming Ruler<BR>
Failed not to thwart the ocean.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Next to these in the figures of poesy are those men who are called chiefs: one may periphrase them as one might a king or an earl, calling them Dispensers of Gold, Wealth Munificent, Men of the Standards, and Captains of the Host, or Van-Leaders of the Array or of Battle; since each king of a nation, who rules over many lands, appoints tributary kings and earls in joint authority with himself, to administer the laws of the land and defend it from attack in those parts which lie far removed from the king. And in those parts they shall be equal with the king's self in giving</P>
<P>{p. 199}</P>
<P>judgment and meting punishment. Now there are many districts in one land; and it is the practice of kings to appoint justiciars over as many districts as one chooses to give into their hands. These justiciars are called chiefs or landed men in the Danish tongue, reeves in Saxony, and barons in England. They are also to be righteous judges and faithful warriors over the land which is entrusted to them for governance. If the king is not near, then a standard shall be borne before them in battle; and then they are quite as lawful war-captains as kings or earls.</P>
<P>"Next under them are those men who are called franklins: they are those freeholders who are of honorable kindred, and possessed of full rights. One may periphrase them by calling them Wealth-Givers, and Protectors, and Reconcilers of Men; headmen also may have these titles.</P>
<P>"Kings and earls have as their following the men called henchmen and house-carles; landed-men also have in their service those who are called henchmen in Denmark and Sweden, and house-carles in Norway, and these men swear oaths of service to them, even as henchmen do to kings. The house-carles of kings were often called henchmen in the old heathen time.</P>
<P>Thus sang Thorvaldr Blending Skald:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Hail, King, swift in the onset!<BR>
And thy sturdy house-carles with thee!<BR>
In their mouths men have my verses,<BR>
Made for a song of praising.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>King Haraldr Sigurdarson composed this:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The man full mighty waiteth<BR>
The filling of the King's seat;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 200}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Oft, I find, to the Earl's heels<BR>
Throngs my host of house-carles.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Henchmen and house-carles may be periphrased by calling them House-Guard, or Wage-Band, or Men of Honor: thus sang Sigvatr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I learned the Warrior's Wage-Band<BR>
On the water fought that battle<BR>
Newly: 't is not the smallest<BR>
Snow-shower of Shields I tell of.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And thus also:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When on the Steed of Cables<BR>
The clashing steel was meeting,<BR>
'T was not as when a maid bears<BR>
The Chief's mead to the Honor-Winners.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The service-fee which headmen give is called wages and gifts; thus sang &Oacute;ttarr the Swarthy:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I needs must use the Breaker<BR>
Of the Battle-Glow of good men;<BR>
Here is the watch war-doughty<BR>
Of the Wise King assembled.[1]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Earls and chiefs and henchmen are periphrased by calling them Counsellors or Speech-Friends or Seat-Mates of the King, as Hallfredr sang:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See page 176.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 201}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Counsellor battle-mighty<BR>
Of the Prince, whom boldness pleases,<BR>
Lets the feud-fiery weeds of H&ouml;gni,<BR>
Hammer-beaten, clash upon him.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As Snaebj&ouml;rn sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Speech-Friend of Kings letteth<BR>
The long-hulled steer-rope's Race-Horse<BR>
Steady the swordlike steel beak<BR>
Of the ship against the stern wave.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Arn&oacute;rr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>My young sons do bear for my sake<BR>
Grave sorrow for the slaughter<BR>
Of the Earl, destroyed by murder,<BR>
The Bench-Mate of our Monarch.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>King's Counsel-Friend, as Hallfredr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In council 't was determined<BR>
That the King's Friend, wise in counsel,<BR>
Should wed the Land, sole Daughter<BR>
Of &Oacute;narr, greenly wooded.[1]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>One should periphrase men by their kindred; as Korm&aacute;kr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Let the son of Haraldr's true friend<BR>
Give ear, and hearken to me:<BR>
I raise my song, the Yeast-Stream<BR>
Of S&yacute;r's snow-covered Monsters.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See page 136.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 202}</P>
<P>He called the Earl True Friend of the King, and H&aacute;kon, Son of Earl Sigurdr. And Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr sang thus concerning Haraldr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>About &Oacute;lafr's sire<BR>
Waxed the steel-knife-storm's ire,<BR>
That of wightness each deed<BR>
Is worthy fame's meed.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And again:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Jarizleifr could espy<BR>
Where the king passed by:<BR>
The brave, sainted lord's kin<BR>
Stoutly praise did win.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And again he sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Breath-bereft is he<BR>
Who o'er all bore the gree,--<BR>
Of chiefs kinsman mild,<BR>
Haraldr's brother's child.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Arn&oacute;rr also sang thus in <I>R&ouml;gnvaldr's Song of Praise</I>:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Heiti's war-good kinsman<BR>
Made wedlock-kindred with me:<BR>
The earl's strong tie of marriage<BR>
Made honor to us rendered.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And again, concerning Earl Thorfinnr, he sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The thin-made swords bit keenly<BR>
Old R&ouml;gnvaldr's kin, to southward</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 203}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Of Man, where rushed the strong hosts<BR>
Under the sheltering shield-rims.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And he sang further:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>O God, guard the glorious<BR>
Kin-Betterer of great Turf-Einarr<BR>
From harm; I pray, show mercy<BR>
To him whom faithful chiefs love.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And Einarr Tinkling-Scale sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The House-Prop of the Kindred<BR>
Of Hildit&ouml;nn shall not lack<BR>
Hardihood more munificent;<BR>
I am bound to maintain praises.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>LIII. "How are the uninvolved terms of poesy made? By calling each thing by its proper name. What are the simple terms for poesy? It is called Poetry, Glorifying, Song, Laud, and Praise. Bragi the Old sang this, when he was travelling through a forest late at evening: a troll woman hailed him in verse, asking who passed:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>'Trolls do call me<BR>

Yggr's Ale-Bearer,<BR>

Skilled Smith of Verse:<BR>
What is the Skald but this?'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Korm&aacute;kr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I make more Glorifying<BR>
By far o'er H&aacute;kon's great son:<BR>
I pay him the song-atonement<BR>
Of the gods. In his wain Thor sitteth.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And as Th&oacute;rdr Kolbeinsson sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Shield-Maple let many swift ships<BR>
And merchant-craft, and speedy<BR>
War-boats o'er the sea pour;<BR>
The skald's ready Song of Laud waxed.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Laud, as &Uacute;lfr Uggason sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Now the stream to the sea cometh;<BR>
But first the Laud I sang forth<BR>
Of the Messenger of Sword-Rain:<BR>
Thus I raise the praise of warriors.</P></DIR>

<P>or corpses; and then their names are terms of the eagle or the raven. As Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Prince with Eagle's Barley<BR>
Doth feed the bloody moor-fowl:<BR>
The H&ouml;rd-King bears the sickle<BR>
Of Odin to the gory Swan's crop;<BR>
The Sater of the Vulture<BR>
Of the Eagle's Sea of corpses<BR>
Stakes each shoal to the southward<BR>
Which he wards, with the spear-point.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>These are names of the raven: Crow, Huginn,[1] Muninn,[1] Bold of Mood, Yearly Flier, Year-Teller, Flesh-Boder.</P>
<P>Thus sang Einarr Tinkling-Scale:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With flesh the Host-Convoker<BR>
Filled the feathered ravens:<BR>
The raven, when spears were screaming,<BR>
With the she-wolf's prey was sated.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Einarr Sk&uacute;lason:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He who gluts the Gull of Hatred,<BR>
Our precious lord, could govern<BR>
The sword; the hurtful raven<BR>
Of Huginn's corpse-load eateth.</P></DIR>

On the isle; the Bold of Mood then<BR>
Received the meat of wound-blood.</P></DIR>

Might Hl&ouml;kk of horns have seen me,<BR>
Where to the Yearly Flier<BR>
I fed the wounds full grievous.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The erne is called Eagle, Old One, Storm-Shearer, Inciter, Soarer, Wound-Shearer, Cock. As Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With blood the lips he reddened<BR>
Of the black steed of J&aacute;rnsaxa;<BR>
With steel Erne's meat was furnished:<BR>
The Eagle slit the Wolf's Bait.</P></DIR>

<P>And as stands here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With skill will I rehearse<BR>
Of the Storm-Shearer my verse.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And again as Sk&uacute;li sang:</P><DIR>

I wake, where well is sated<BR>
The hawk of the Cock's blood-ocean:<BR>
Then the bard heareth good tidings.</P></DIR>

<P>LX. "What are the names of the Sea? It is called Ocean, Main, Wintry, Lee, Deep, Way, Weir, Salt, Lake, Furtherer. As Arn&oacute;rr sang, and as we have written above:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Let men hear how the Earls' King,<BR>
Hardy of mind, the Sea sought;<BR>
The overwhelming Ruler<BR>
Failed not to resist the Main.[2]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here it is named Sea, and Main also.</P>
<P>"Ocean, as Hornklofi sang:</P><DIR>

<DIR>

<P>Thrust the Forecastle-Adder<BR>
And the skiff out on the Ocean.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In the following verse it is called Lake as well: thus sang Einarr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Lake doth bathe the vessel,<BR>
Where the sea 'gainst each side beateth,<BR>
And the bright wind-vanes rattle;<BR>
The surf washes the Flood-Steeds.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here it is called Flood also. Thus sang Refr, as was said before:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Wintry One's[1] wet-cold Spae-Wife<BR>
Wiles the Bear of Twisted Cables<BR>
Oft into &AElig;gir's wide jaws,<BR>
Where the angry billow breaketh.[2]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Deep, as Hallvardr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Sword-Shaker bids be pointed<BR>
The prow of the hardy ship-steed<BR>
Westward in the girdle<BR>
Of all lands, the Watery Deep.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Way, as here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>On our course from land we glided;<BR>
On the Way to the coast of Finland:<BR>
I see from the Ship's Road, eastward,<BR>
The fells with radiance gleaming.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Weir, as Egill sang:</P>

<P>2. See page 139.]</P>

<P>I sailed o'er the Weir<BR>
To the West: I bear<BR>
Odin's Heart-Sea.<BR>
So it stands with me.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Ocean, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Many a day the cold Ocean<BR>
Washes the swarthy deck-planks<BR>
'Neath the gracious Prince; and Snow-Storm<BR>
Furrows Mona's Girdle.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Salt, as Arn&oacute;rr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The hardy King the Salt plowed<BR>
From the east with hull ice-laden:<BR>
Brown tempests tossed the Lessener<BR>
Of Surf-Gold toward Sigt&uacute;n.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Furtherer, as B&ouml;lverkr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Thou didst summon from fair Norway<BR>
A levy the next season,<BR>
With Din-Surf's ships the Furtherer<BR>
Didst shear; o'er decks the sea poured.<BR>
Here the sea is called Din-Surf also.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Wide One, as Refr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To its breast the Stay's steed taketh<BR>
The Home of Planks, beak-furrowed,<BR>
And tosses the Wide One over<BR>
The hard side; the wood suffers.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 219}</P>
<P>Dusky One, as Nj&aacute;ll of the Burning sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>We sixteen pumped, my Lady,<BR>
In four oar-rooms, but the surge waxed:<BR>
The Dusky One beat over<BR>
The hull of the driven sea-ship.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>These are other names for the Sea, such as it is proper to use in periphrasing ships or gold.</P>
<P>"R&aacute;n, it is said, was &AElig;gir's wife, even as is written here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To the sky shot up the Deep's Gledes,<BR>
With fearful might the sea surged:<BR>
Methinks our stems the clouds cut,--<BR>
R&aacute;n's Road to the moon soared upward.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The daughters of &AElig;gir and R&aacute;n are nine, and their names are recorded before: Himingl&aelig;va,[1] D&uacute;fa,[2] Bl&oacute;dughadda,[3] Hefring,[4] Udr,[5] Hr&ouml;nn,[6] Bylgja,[7] Dr&ouml;fn,[8] K&oacute;lga.[9] Einarr Sk&uacute;lason recorded the names of six of them in this stanza, beginning:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Himingl&aelig;va sternly stirreth,<BR>
And fiercely, the sea's wailing.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Welling Wave,[10] as Valgardr sang:</P><DIR>

<P>Billow, as Ottarr the Swarthy sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Ye shear with shaven rudder<BR>
Billows moisty-deep; the broad sheet,<BR>
Which girls spun, on the mast-head<BR>
With the Roller's Reindeer sported.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Foam-Fleck, as Ormr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The hawk-like, heedful Lady<BR>
Has every virtue: Lofn<BR>
Of the Foam-Fleck's flame-gold, faithful<BR>
As a friend, all faults renounceth.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Wave-Borne, as Thorleikr the Fair sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The sea walls, and the Wave-Borne<BR>
Bears bright froth o'er the red wood,<BR>
Where gapes the Roller's Brown Ox,<BR>
With mouth gold-ornamented.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Shoal, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Nor met the Forward-Minded,<BR>
Where the fierce sea on our friends falls;<BR>
I think the Shoal becalmed not<BR>
The Ship, Wood of the Waters.</P></DIR>

<P>Fullness, as Refr sang:</P>
<P>{p. 221}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Downward the Fells of Fullness<BR>
Fall on the Bear of Tackle:<BR>
Now forward Winterling, stirreth,<BR>
The ship, on Glammi's sea-path.</P></DIR>

<P>Comber,[1] as here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Comber fell headlong o'er me;<BR>
The Main called me home unto it:<BR>
I accepted not the Sea's bidding.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Breaker, as &Oacute;ttarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In burst the ship-sides thin;<BR>
Rushed the Breaker downward; flushed<BR>
Stood the wind, bane of the wood;<BR>
Men endured wild tempest then.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Wave, as Bragi sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Giver of the Wave's Coals,<BR>
Who cut Thor's slender tackle,<BR>
The Line of the Land of Sea-Mews,<BR>
Loved not to fight the wroth sea.</P></DIR>

<P>Sound, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>

From Hrund south-bound;<BR>

Carved well on the splendid ale-horn:<BR>

Ill is he who spoileth verses.</P></DIR>

<P>LXI. "What are the names of fire? Even as is written here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Not seldom does the fire blaze<BR>
Which Magn&uacute;s sets: the stalwart<BR>
Ruler burns habitations:<BR>
Houses blow reek before him.</P></DIR>

<P>Glow, as Valgardr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Fierce Glow, with red-hot embers,<BR>
Swiftly from the soot flared,<BR>
Straight o'er the tottering dwellings<BR>
Stood up the dense smoke-columns.</P></DIR>

<P>Bale, as here:</P><DIR>

<P>Haki was burned on Bale,<BR>
Where the sea's broad wake weltered.</P></DIR>

<P>Gledes, as Grani sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I think the Gledes diminished&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<BR>
Glammi's tracks; thus the king kindled.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Embers, as Atli sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With blood the axe is reddened,<BR>
Embers wax, burn many houses,<BR>
Halls stand aglow; now rages<BR>
The Gem; good men are falling.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Here fire is called Gem also.</P>
<P>Vapor, as here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Half-built, by the Nid's side<BR>
Burn the All-Ruler's dwellings;<BR>
I think fire razed the hall's pride:<BR>
Vapor shot rime on the people.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Hot Ashes, as Arn&oacute;rr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Isle-Danes' wrathful Harmer<BR>
With the Raumar spared not hard counsel:<BR>
Hot Ashes made them calmer;<BR>
The Heinir's threatening words hushed.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Flames, as Einarr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Flame soon was alight,<BR>
And swiftly took flight<BR>
All H&iacute;sing's host:<BR>
The fight they lost.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 224}</P>
<P>Flare, as Valgardr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The sturdy king's bright Flare soared<BR>
Above the castle's bulwark;<BR>
The vikings burst in grimly:<BR>
Grief on the maid descended.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Lowe, as Hald&oacute;rr sang:</P><DIR>

<P>There did ye share their jewels,<BR>
While o'er the host the Shield's Lowe,<BR>
The sword, shrieked fiercely: never<BR>
Wert thou spoiled of conquest.</P></DIR>

<P>LXIII. "What are the simple terms for men? Each, in himself, is Man; the first and highest name by which man is called is Emperor; next to that, King; the next thereto, Earl: these three men possess in common all the following titles: All-Ruler, as this song showeth:</P><DIR>

<P>I know all All-Rulers<BR>
East and south, o'er the Ships' seat<BR>
Sveinn's son in proof is better<BR>

<P>Here he is called War-Prince also; for this reason he is called All-Ruler, that he is sole Ruler of all his realm.</P>
<P>Host-Arrayer, as Gizurr sang:</P>
<P>The Host-Arrayer feedeth<BR>

Odin's loved Wife,<BR>
The lordless land;<BR>
His a warrior's life.</P></DIR>

<P>Lord or Lording, as Arn&oacute;rr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Lord of Hjaltland, highest<BR>
Of heroes, gained the victory<BR>
In every thunderous sword-clash:<BR>
The bard will extol his glory.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>An earl is called Host-Duke, and a king also is so termed, forasmuch as he leads his host to battle. Thus sang Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He who put to shame the Host-Duke<BR>
Thrust out the eyes of prisoners,--<BR>
He who speeds the sacrifices;<BR>
In song I chant his praises.</P></DIR>

<P>Signor, or Se&ntilde;or, as Sigvatr sang:</P><DIR>

<P>O Norway's gracious Signor,<BR>
Grant the wretched, as the happy,<BR>

Give greatly, hold thy word!</P></DIR>

<P>The Munificent Prince brought fire's destruction<BR>
O'er the base people; to the pirates<BR>
Death was fated: Thief-Compeller,<BR>
South at J&oacute;m highest flame-glow kindle!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Illustrious One, as Hallvardr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>No Illustrious One nearer<BR>
Under Earth's Hazel liveth<BR>
Than thou, O Monks' Upholder:<BR>
The Gold-Minisher Danes protecteth.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Land-Driver, as Thj&oacute;d&oacute;lfr sang:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The guileless Land-Driver sprinkles<BR>
Kraki's gleaming barley,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>as was written before;[1] he is called so because he drives his host about the lands of other kings, or drives a host out of his own land.</P>
<P>LXIV. "There was a king named H&aacute;lfdan the Old, who was most famous of all kings. He made a great sacrificial feast at mid-winter, and sacrificed to this end, that he might live three hundred years in his kingdom; but he received these answers: he should not live more than the full life of a man, but for three hundred years there should be no woman and no man in his line who was not of great repute. He was a great warrior, and went on forays far and wide in the Eastern Regions:[2] there he slew in single combat the king who was called Sigtryggr. Then he took in</P>

<P>marriage that woman named Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymundr of H&oacute;lmgardr:[1] they had eighteen sons, nine born at one birth. These were their names: the first, Thengill,[2] who was called Manna-Thengill;[2] the second, R&aelig;sir;[3] the third, Gramr;[3] the fourth, Gylfi;[3] the fifth, Hilmir;[3] the sixth, J&ouml;furr;[3] the seventh, Tyggi;[3] the eighth, Skyli[3] or Sk&uacute;li;[3] the ninth, Harri[3] or Herra.[3] These nine brothers became so famous in foraying that, in all records since, their names are used as titles of rank, even as the name of King or that of Earl. They had no children, and all fell in battle. Thus sang Ottarr the Swarthy:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In his youth stalwart Thengill<BR>
Was swift and staunch in battle:<BR>
I pray his line endureth;<BR>
O'er all men I esteem him.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Thus sang Markus:</P>
<P>The R&aelig;sir let the Rhine's Sun shimmer<BR>

From the race of Hildings sprang Haraldr the Red-Bearded, mother's father of H&aacute;lfdan the Swarthy. Of the Niflung's house was Gj&uacute;ki; of the house of &Ouml;dlings, Kj&aacute;rr; of the house of the Ylfings was Eir&iacute;kr the Wise in Speech.

One should periphrase the breast by calling it House or Garth or Ship of the Heart, of Breath, or of the Liver; Land of Energy, of Feeling, and of Memory]. Feeling is affection and emotion, love, passion, desire, love-longing. [Passion should be periphrased by calling it Wind of Troll Women; also it is correct to name what one soever is desired, and to name giants, periphrasing giantesses as Woman or Mother or Daughter of the Giants.] Feeling is also called mood, liking, eagerness, courage, activity, memory, understanding,</P>

<P>LXXIV. "Expression is of two kinds: that which is called voice, and that which is called manners; manners is also temper. <I>Rei&eth;i</I>[2] also has double meaning: <I>rei&eth;i</I>[2] is the ill humor of a man, and <I>rei&eth;i</I>[2] is also the rigging of a ship or the driving-gear of a horse. <I>F&aacute;r</I> also has double meaning: <I>f&aacute;r</I>[2] signifies wrath, and <I>far</I>[2] signifies a ship.</P>
<P>"Men have made frequent use of such ambiguous expressions as these; and this practice is called punning. [<I>Lith</I>[3] is that part of a man where bones meet; <I>li&eth;</I> is a word for ship; <I>li&eth;</I> means people; when a man renders an other assistance, his aid is <I>li&eth;</I>; <I>l&iacute;&eth;</I> signifies ale. <I>Hli&eth;</I> signifies the gate in a garth; <I>hli&eth;r</I> men call an ox, and <I>hl&iacute;&eth;</I> signifies a slope. One may make such use of these distinct meanings in skaldship as to make a pun that is hard to interpret, provided one employ other distinctions than those which are indicated by the half-lines which precede. These cases are there, and many others, in which divers things have the same name in common.]"</P>
