IN THE MORNING.</h4>  
<p>Welcome! for showing thy countenance, for dawning forth, thou golden Sun, for rising now, thou 'morning star'! From under the waves thou hast escaped, hast mounted above the clumps of firs, like a golden cuckoo, like a silver dove hast risen up to the level sky, to thy former state, on thy ancient tour. Rise ever at the proper time, after this very day as well, bring as a gift on coming home, give us completest health, into our hands convey the game, the quarry to our thumb's tip, good luck to our hook's point;</p>  
<p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></A></p>  
<p>go on thy circuit pleasantly, conclude the journey of the day, at eve attain to happiness.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 111. TREASURE-SEEKING.</h4>  
<p>Kinsman of Hiisi! rise, awake, thou mountain haltia, to show a man the path, to point to a full-grown man the place where booty is to be obtained, treasures can be opened up before a man who is making search, a fellow creeping on his knees.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 112. AGAINST ELF-SHOTS.</h4>  
<p>From the earth rise, Ghostly Shade (<i>manalainen</i>), like a horror, hairless one, like a hideous fright, clod-headed. one, approach to take away thy blast, to take possession of thine own; the injury thou dost, force down into Tuoni's turf, to the end of the hut of Manala, not into a human being's skin or into a creature's (<i>kave</i>) hide.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 113. AGAINST WASPS.</h4>  
<p>O Siilikki [<i>v</i>. Huijutar], woods&#8217; daughter-in-law, pray discipline thy wee 'winged bird,' hide away thy 'feathered chick,' bind up its wings, confine its claws, to prevent it stabbing with its pike, to prevent it sharpening its steel. Kuutar, conceal thy children now, hide, P&auml;iv&auml;t&auml;r, thy family, and follow not a wizard's wish, don't be made jealous by jealous folk.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 114. AGAINST TOOTHACHE.</h4>  <h5 align="center">a</h5>  
<p>Come, boy, from Pohjola, boy of the north, and iron-kneed, to grind this Hiisi, this Juutas crush. String a fiery</p>  
<p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></A></p>  
<p>bow, draw a copper crooked bow with a fiery string &#8217;gainst thy left knee; feather a fiery bolt with all an eagle's plumes, with the feathers of a sparrow's tail, to be used with the fiery bow; shoot with it Tuoni's grub,' fell the bone-biter with a bang, shoot through the teeth the eater of bone, the biter of flesh, that it cease to eat, to crunch, to fret, to gnaw, that Hiisi's cat' cease shattering, that 'Lempo's dog' cease tearing up, cease ravaging the jaws, cease hacking down the teeth.</p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>  
<p>Short maiden, Tuoni's girl, take from the teeth this 'cur,' this Lempo from the jaws; press down thy maladies, force down thine injuries, fling down thy filthiness into an iron baking-pan, at the end of Piru's tongs, &#8217;mong Hiisi's coals, in the fire of the evil power. Thou'lt frizzle, Tuoni's grub, thou&#8217;lt simmer, worm of earth, thy head will be badly scorched, thy despicable tongue will swell in the iron baking-pan, at the end of Piru's tongs, &#8217;mong Hiisi's coals, in the fire of the evil power.</p>  <h5 align="center">c</h5>  
<p>Heigh! old man, my aunt's son, thou old white-bearded man, just strike with thy whip the ground, with thy thong produce a crack, that a mist from the ground may rise, in the mist a little man, on the shoulder of whom is a bow, in his fist a little bolt; the bow is made of steel, in copper the bolt is cast. I'll shoot with it Hiisi's son, that he cease to eat and gnaw, that he cease to bite and bore, that 'Lempo's cur' shall cease to rend the cherished teeth, the poor cheek-bones.</p>

<p>Expert St. Stephen (<i>Tapani</i>), come, to keep watch close at hand when I send a horse to grass, drive out my small one on the yard, from under a lovely shed, from under a double roof, to the summer grazing-grounds, to the summer sheltered spots, to the honey-dropping sward, to the honeyed grassy knolls. Let it stay happily at the edge of a holy field, to delight me in the afternoon, in the forenoon to make me pleased.</p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>  
<p>Lord of horses, Tahvanus [<i>v</i>. Timanter, v. Rukotiivo], a god that cleans the mangers out, over my herds keep watch, give fodder to my steeds, devoid of speech, devoid of strength, devoid of guilt, devoid of guile. As thou hast watched them &#8217;neath the shed, defended them &#8217;neath shelter-boards, so watch when they are roofless too, defend them in the bushy woods, when on beds of pine-tree sprays, on pillows made of twigs, that not a hair be broken off, not half a one should come away, against the will of God, despite the intentions of the Blest. If a hair be broken off, e&#8217;en half a one should come away, I shall at once demand a brace, I'll sternly make request for three.</p>  <h5 align="center">c</h5>  
<p>O Iki Tiera [<i>v</i>. Hiki Tiera, Niera's [Miera's] son,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> snow-hoofed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and bony-hoofed, pray come to keep watch close</p>

<p>at hand, to overlook most carefully when I send out a horse to grass, let loose a mare upon the plain, when I throw the halter on the ground, the horse's bell upon the sand. Stand brush in hand at night and holding a comb by day, brush till it gets a lynx-like skin, the coat of a forest-animal (kave).</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 116. WHEN GORED BY AN OX.</h4>  
<p>Let thy father Santta S&auml;it&auml;ri, thy lovely mother Pullukka, come to keep watch close by, to overlook from very near, so that the boy shall not depart, the mother's son not slip away from a life by the Creator made, fashioned by God Himself. O Virgin Mary, mother dear, beloved mother, pitiful, pray sanctify with words, prohibit with thy sentences, for holy are thy words, and potent are thy sentences.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 117. AT A BRIDAL PROCESSION.</h4>  <h5 align="center">a</h5>  
<p>From whom shall I&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> ask help for my protection, my support, while this girl is being given away, this man is being betrothed, unenvied by the envious, by an evil wisher undisturbed?</p>  
<p>From yonder person I ask for help, from yonder woman I cry for aid: from the gravel, bony-fingered, rise, steel-jawed, from the muddy strand, from the spring, O maiden, rise, 'blue-socks,' from a corner of the swamp. If thou no leisure hast thyself, the uprightest of thy lassies send, the best of all thy serving-maids to cover up this family, this bridal party to conceal. O woman (kave), old</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A></p>  
<p>wife Luonnotar, thou darling woman (<i>kave</i>) and beautiful, begin to indicate the path, to rectify the road to where the girl is given away, the bride is in procession led. May the paths be opened up, may broken roads be rendered smooth; if a fallen tree should block the way, shove it aside, that the great may pass, the small may pass, the weak may move along.</p>  
<p>If that is not enough from yonder person I ask for help, from my father in the sky, from my mother in the depths of earth, from whom enduring mercies come, familiar help proceeds. Come, father, from the sky, my mother,&#8212;from the depths of earth, to give away this maiden's hand, to lead this man to be betrothed, to overthrow the envious, to overcome the enemy.</p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>  
<p>Plenty there are of hissing mouths, of husky throats, of sorcerers beside the path, of envious people in every place, while a bridal party trudges past, a man is led to be betrothed.</p>  
<p>Ho! Ukko, lord on high, the god that over journeys rules, that holdest fast the clouds, that governest the fleecy clouds, O come from the sky like fire, quiver like a burning brand, having the size of a forest fir, the stature of a swamp-grown pine, though not against myself, nor against my followers, but against the enemies, against tremendous accidents. Start with us, come in company to conduct my bridal train, to tear up spell-cast injuries, to scatter all impediments, to crush the criminals, to snatch away the sorcerers, to squeeze the fiend, to overthrow the spook (<i>kamulainen</i>), to break the devilish weather up, to trample down roads broken up, while I am travelling by</p>  
<p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></A></p>  
<p>land, or I on the water row, am on the mountains wandering or roving o&#8217;er low-lying ground. Should some one stand across the path, send him aside; if a snake should lie along the road, break it in two at once; if there are trees or fallen trees, shove them aside, if logs are on my path, from the path remove the logs, let the tree-placer become a tree, let the log-maker become a log.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 118. FOR CATCHING HARES.</h4>  <h5 align="center">a</h5>  
<p>O forest's mistress, Elina, a woman with body undefiled, now bring the game from further off, from the foot of the forest-fort, from the side of the honeyed woods, from the rear of the copper hills; permit a 'bandy legs' to run, a squinting eyes' to lob along, to come this way without alarm, bobbing along without demur, let a big one come or a little one, or one of medium size approach directly towards my trap, towards my snare, to tread with its feet upon my gin, that stands in front of its two paws, avoiding other people's snares, shunning the traps of other men.</p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>  
<p>O Tapio's daughter, Lumikki, thy snow-white creatures (<i>lumikki</i>) stir, release thy 'gold'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to wander forth, thy 'silver'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to rove around; turn hither a 'bandy legs,' a 'slender paws' to the centre here, under the firmament of air, towards a man in search of it, towards a stately full-grown man, towards one of a woman born. If from the track it turn away, from its furrow it diverge, by the tail just pull it on the track, or by the ears just set it right, let</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></A></p>  
<p>it run with rapidity, let it hurry with hasty foot, without a wizard's knowing it, without being heard by a 'fiery throat,' across the edges of the field, the lower side of untilled land, past other peoples&#8217; cords, under the snares of other men, to the place where I set my gins, to my traps that should be trod, in front of a man in search of game, to the steps of one demanding it.</p>  <h5 align="center">c</h5>  
<p>Distinguished maiden, Varvutar, Mikit&auml;r, forest's daughter-in-law, the daughter of Tapio, Annikki, give me when I request, when I with a golden tongue complain; cause thy 'sheep' to come this way, cast out thy 'distaffs bound with wool.' Bestow them heartily from the deep forest dells in threes, in fives, in sixes from the copse, in sevens from the abandoned fields, in eights from clumps of juniper, before the man in search of them, at the steps of him that walks along.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 119. AGAINST CABBAGE GRUBS.</h4>  
<p>Thou famous maiden, Kulotar, thou lovely woman Kanarvatar, remove thy 'dogs,' eject thy 'curs' from my life-sustaining herbs, these food-producing plants, ere their destruction comes, ere Ukko breaks their heads with drops from the clouds, with iron hail. O 'witch-ball' (<i>tyr&auml;</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a mother, Maarana, at the end of a blue bridge sit, holding an iron hook; when thou seest the 'witch-ball' come, make a rattle with thine iron, make a clatter with thy hook.</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 120. FISHING.</h4>  <h5 align="center">a</h5>  
<p>Foam-mantled Ahti [<i>v</i>. Ahto] of the sea! reed-bearded old man of the sea, throw over thee luck-bringing clothes, put on gift-giving shirts, at this thy time for giving gifts, on this my day for catching fish; give me thy gift, abundantly and promptly draw the crowd that fills the watery tent, the dwellers underneath the wave; from sand-banks gather in the fish, the perch with short and crooked necks, to listen to the music here, to V&auml;in&auml;in&ouml;inen's melody.</p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>  
<p>O Ahti [<i>v</i>. Ahto], master of the waves, the ruler of a hundred caves, give me some perch, impel thy 'spiky-backs,' to where this net is lifted out, to where the hundred-eyed' is dropt; take a stake five fathoms long, a pole of seven fathoms seize, with which to persecute the seas, to stir the bottom of the sea, to raise a shoal of bony ones, to frighten the fishy herd from the fishy bays, from the salmon holes to waters where the nets are cast, to where this net is lifted out.</p>  <h5 align="center">c</h5>  
<p>O water's mistress, Vellamo, water's old wife with reedy breast, come here to exchange thy shirt, to change thy clothes. On thee is a shirt of reeds, on thee is a sea-foam cloak, made by the daughter of the wind, the gift of Aallotar; I give thee a linen shirt, of linen entirely made, by Kuutar woven and spun by P&auml;iv&auml;t&auml;r [<i>v</i>. Kaunotar].</p>  <h5 align="center">d</h5>  
<p>O water's golden king, damp-bearded and with slouching hat, forget thy long enduring hate, thy long protracted</p>  
<p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></A></p>  
<p>niggardness; come along with me to fish, as a mate to catch fresh fish, give me some full-grown perch, abundantly of 'crooked necks,' of slippery siks, of dark grey pike. May the dear fish rush into my traps on holidays as formerly a squirrel rushed, alarmed in a clump of firs, jumped suddenly on the swaying boughs, on the leafy trees.</p>  <h5 align="center">e</h5>  
<p>Old wife of the sea with reedy breast, give me some perch from the great centres of the sea, from the gloomy depths, from where the sun ne&#8217;er shines, from where the sand is undisturbed, from the open sea's black mud, from the bosom of a bulky wave; frighten the fishy shoal, stir up the swarm of bony ones, chase it from the grots below, from the holes of the reefs in the sea to tug my lines, to make my threads resound; give thy big fish, till the little ones enlarge, cede thy fat fish till the lean ones fatten up.</p>  <h5 align="center">f</h5>  
<p>On the water I cast my net, I fasten my sinks of stone; thou fair old wife, Juolehetar, the water's mistress, benevolent, rise hither from the mud, to give thy well-beloved from thy capacious magazine. Send forth the fishy herd to seas that of old are full of fish, to where I intend to cast the nets; give those for which I beg, bring those for which I ask, from the holes of the reefs pray lift them out, and from recesses of the rocks.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 121. BEAR-HUNTING.</h4>  
<p>Louhi, the mistress of Pohjola, thrust forth thy woolly fist, turn round thy hairy palm before a man in search of</p>  
<p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="green">p. 208</font></A></p>  
<p>game, close to a full-grown walking man. By the Maker &#8217;twould be allowed, by the Creator be vouchsafed, by Tapio be wished that I should get big game, that I should prostrate 'honey paws.'</p>  
<p>When I am going to the woods, to the door of bruin's room, pray, oldest of the island, say, speak, lovely Taaria, who art nine sleeping-places away from here, a hundred stages to the rear: 'My "little hay stack," "cock of hay," my "little apple," my wee bear, pray don't disturb thyself at all, don't take it in the least amiss; with virgin honey thou&#8217;lt be fed, new honey thou wilt have to drink &#8217;mong full-grown men, in a crowd of men.'</p>  
<p>O forest mistress, Mielikki, O Tapio's daughter, Annikki, O Tapio's maiden, Tellervo, thou tiny little forest lass, come hither, there is need of thee, to the hill's north side. Collar thy 'dogs,'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> restrain thy 'hounds,' in a dogwood sty, in an oaken shed; bend a rowan band or prepare an oaken one with which to muzzle bruin's mouth, lest he open up his jaw while I am coming to the shed, to the court-yard of 'tiny eyes,' to the trampled ground of 'level nose.'</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 122. AGAINST A BEAR.</h4>  <h5 align="center">a</h5>  
<p>Old man of Juumi, Juumi's old wife, Juumi's former inhabitants, keep in your 'dog,' restrain your 'hound' from the tracts where the cattle range, from these wide tracts of underwood. From the mould a brown one has attacked, a grey one from a sandy heath, a 'big foot' from the swamp has risen, a 'broad paws' from a leafy grove, a 'badger' from the earth has come, from the copse an</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="green">p. 209</font></A></p>  
<p>enemy has hurried into evil deeds, has taken to dirty deeds. May the forest bear be choked with a honey ball in his mouth, so that his jaws won't open up, that his teeth won't come apart, that the 'central flesh' won't move, that the tongue won't freely wag.</p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>  
<p>When the king of forest wilds, the forest's grey one, few of teeth, from his chamber hustles forth, from his castle sallies forth, then forest-mistress, Mielikki, daughter of Tapio, Tuometar, anoint his claws with wort, with honey foment his teeth, that he may never touch a thing, not even when in haste, when trampling over cattle-grounds, when roaming up and down the swamps.</p>  
<p>If he pay no heed thereto, but still continues doing harm; Kuitua [<i>v</i>. Kuittola], forest king, Hongas, the mistress benevolent, keep in thy 'dog,' restrain thy 'hound' with collars of gold, with silver straps, behind nine locks, ten bars that open from behind, so that the headstrong cannot run, 'broad brow' can't scuffle with his feet, 'homespun breeks can't roll along, 'blue socks' can't slowly plod to places where my cattle range, to my bullocks&#8217; grazing-grounds.</p>  <h5 align="center">c</h5>  
<p>King of the forest, Kuippana, thou lively grey-beard of the woods, inhibit now thy son, prevent thy bastard son from seeking my live stock, from meddling with my herd. If that is not enough, is still an insufficient guard, prevent the motion of his tongue, the quivering of his pointed nose, stick a mushroom up one nostril and an apple up the other one, lest the cattle's breath give forth a smell, the</p>  
<p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A></p>  
<p>scent of the cattle should be exhaled; over his eyes bind silk, over his ears a bandage tie, lest he should hear the trampling herd, lest he perceive the wanderers.</p>  <h5 align="center">d</h5>  
<p>Good mistress, Hongatar, observant woman, Tapiotar, come, when thou art needed, here, approach, when thou art summoned here, the evil actions of thy son, thy child's outrageous deeds to see. Here damage has come to pass, an accident occurred, thy son has done an evil deed, thy child an act of villany; the villain broke his oath, ate his honour like a dog, when he took to evil acts, began committing hideous deeds.</p>  <h4 align="center">&sect; 123. TO BENEFIT CATTLE.</h4>  <h5 align="center">a</h5>  
<p>Distinguished woman, Suvetar, Nature's old wife, Etel&auml;t&auml;r, that art a watcher of the herd, a keeper of the mistress's flock, arise to cleanse the byre, to watch the cattle of the byre, bring hither luck to calves, toss in to the oxen luck. Shape out a golden comb, furnish a silver brush, provide with a copper comb the doorposts of the door, on which the cattle can rub themselves, the mistress's flock can comb themselves. Pray go with a brush in hand at night and holding a comb by day, without being seen by any one, without alarming any one, and beautifully watch the herd, tend the flock with diligence, comb them as smooth as a lynx's coat, as the downy coat of a forest 'ewe,' that the cattle be beautified, that the mistress's flock may thrive, before the mistress makes her rounds, before the herding lassie looks, a mistress who is good for nought, a witless herding-lass.</p>  
<p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>  
<p>O Jesus consecrate my flock, watch, Jesus, o&#8217;er my herd, this summer of Jesus, this important summer-time of God, when from the cowhouse I discharge, send forth my kine to the leafy grove, drive out my cattle to the heath, conduct them to great wooded tracts, along the 'yard of God,'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> along the ground of Mary dear, to 'cattle-sheds without a hole and windowless.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Ukko, the golden king, the god that in the sky abides, come watch my herd beautifully all summer-time; as thou hast watched them &#8217;neath a shed, watch them among the heather too, as thou didst tend them in the house, so tend them in the clumps of fir, tend them among the firs, rule over them near boughs of pine.</p>  <h5 align="center">c</h5>  
<p>King of the forest, Kuitua, Hongas, the mistress benevolent, daughter of Tapio, Tellervo, thou tiny little forest lass, when I send out my cows to the delightful Metsola, set a shepherd of willow wood, tall lassies of mountain-ash, cow-watchers of alder wood, of wild bird-cherry to drive them home, without a shepherd's driving them, without a herding-lassie's care.</p>  <h5 align="center">d</h5>  
<p>I crave from the Creator leave, and confidence from God; Creator, watch my herd, preserve, kind God, my herd in every place without a hurt, without a scratch, uninjured by a neighbour's spell, that the wind sha&#8217;n&#8217;t dangerously blow, the rain not dangerously fall, that bitter cold shall hurt it not.</p>

<p>Distinguished woman, Suvetar, Nature's old wife, Etel&auml;t&auml;r, pray bring thy horn from further off, from the centre of the sky; from the sky a honeyed horn, a honeyed horn from the depths of earth. Then blow upon thy horn, toot on thy famous one, that lakes of milk may issue forth, that streams of butter begin to flow. By blowing beflower the knolls, make beautiful the sandy heaths, make exquisite the abandoned fields, make pleasant the leafy groves, into liquid honey turn the swamps, and swampy pools into wort of malt, on which thou&#8217;lt feed my herd, wilt nourish up my kine, wilt increase the milk of my Hermikki, augment the yield of my Tuorikki, wilt feed them with honeyed food, wilt treat them to honeyed grass from verdant knolls, from honeyed turf, wilt feed with golden withered grass, with silver heads of grass, from golden knolls, from silver wastes; water my cattle afterwards, water them well with honeyed drink from pools of whey, from gushing springs, from foaming cataracts, from running streams, that never fail from age to age, that never come to an end at all.</p>  <h5 align="center">f</h5>  
<p>Thou son of Tapio, Nyypetti, art appointed herding-lad to watch my herd on the summer cattle-grounds; watch well my herd, watch o&#8217;er the herd, give the drove to drink, give food to the wretched colts on the summer pasturage, along the swamps, along firm ground, &#8217;long the waters of Pohjola.</p>  <h5 align="center">b</h5>

Take care of the weaker kine, the weaker ones, the smaller ones, lest they should come to grief, should stumble into shame; let Kirjo range o&#8217;er wooded wilds, along the 'yard of God,' along the ground of Mary dear; while the evening bath is being prepared, drive thou my cattle home rejoicing to the great court-yards before conclusion of the day, before the setting of the sun.</p>  <h5 align="center">h</h5>  
<p>O Katrinatar, woman fair, the girl of night, the maid of dusk, pray take five serving-girls, six who obey command, to watch my herd, to tend my kine, that the herd may freely rove, that the 'small hoofs' shall not fear, that the calves sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be alarmed, that the cold weather sha&#8217;n&#8217;t scatter them. May a wolf bar up his mouth, may the tooth of a bear be broken off from summer night to winter night. But if it pay no heed to that, construct an iron fence, erect a fence with stakes of steel round my live stock, on either side of my herd of kine.

If that is not enough, take from V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen's belt the yellow-coloured cloak, if no heed is paid to that, snatch the Creator's silk, take the Almighty's cloak, with the Creator's hair-plait tie, with the Maker's wrappers bandage up those rents produced by iron, the gashes by a 'blue edge' (F. mouth) made; make them whole at night, without pain by day, at night draw over them a skin, by day let grow a cuticle more perfect than before, better than formerly.</p>  <h5 align="center">c</h5>  
<p>O Virgin Mary, mother dear, the holy little serving-maid, fly along an edge of cloud from the sky to earth, to bind up veins, to stop blood's mouth; from the water bring a birch-bark slice, slice from an alder tree a chip, draw the knife from thy sheath, seize thy pocket-axe with which thou'll cut a chip, wilt shave a shaving off, to place on the wound that is cut, on the hole that is torn, to close the mouth of the hole, to dam the passage of the blood, lest the 'milk' to the ground should flow, the carmine drop upon the field.</p>  <h5 align="center">d</h5>
