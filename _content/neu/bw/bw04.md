FROM  
LAPLAND  
OF  
AURORA COLORS  
WHITE SILENCE  
MOSSY TUNDRAS  
AND HILLS WHERE  
REINDEER  
FEED

Lapland's Children, they are singing,  
Chant the Children of the Northland!  
While the winter nights grow longer,  
And the days have no returnings;  
And the Long Nights shimmer whitely  
O'er the icy wastes and tundras;  
Where the Reindeer nibble mosses,  
Silver lichens 'neath the snowfall.

Lapland's Children still are singing,  
Chant the Children of the Northland!  
"See! across the sky are sweeping  
Amber lights that shift and flutter,  
Rosy arc and violet flashings,  
Flames that dart and veils that tremble,  
O'er the sky they move and glimmer!"

Lapland's Children still are singing,  
Chant the Children of the Northland!  
"See! O see! The Merry Dancers,  
Towards the zenith streaming, leaping!  
In the heart of the Aurora,  
Dance the Merry Baltic Wizards,  
From the Lands of Baltic Wonders,  
From the Lands of Baltic Magic!"
