<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE ULDAS' OLD MOTHER</H3>
<P>Now this is what happened once, in Lapland of the Northern Lights!</P>
<P>The Lapps know that Ulda Fairy Folk carry off children, so Lapp fathers and mothers give their children amulets of silver, brass, or copper, to frighten away the Uldas.</P>
<P>There was once a Lapp Mother, who did not give her baby an amulet. One day she saw that her child was looking funny, and acting funnily.</P>
<P>She knew then that the Uldas had carried off her own child, and had left a changeling.</P>
<P>An old Lapp woman told her:</P>
<P>"You must whip that changeling hard. You must put it in a room by itself"--for the Lapp Mother lived in a house--"and you must set a small plate of porridge on the table, with many spoons. Then see what you shall see!</P>
<P>The Lapp Mother did this. She shut the child in a room with a tiny dish of porridge and many spoons. Then she heard the child say:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I've lived as long as the dwarf birches,<BR>
Lived as long as mountain birches,<BR>
Never have I seen such doings!<BR>
Many spoons and little porridge</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then the Lapp Mother knew for sure, that the child was a changeling. She rushed in and whipped it hard--whipped, and whipped, and whipped--beat, and beat, and beat! Then she locked the changeling in by itself, but first she set some burning lights in the room.</P>
<P>By and by she heard Voices. The Uldas were speaking.</P>
<P>"They have been beating our Old Mother," said the Voices. "We cannot stand that!"</P>
<P>And when the Lapp Mother opened the door and peeped in, there was her own child safe and sound. The Uldas had carried off their Old Mother!</P>
<P>You may be sure that the Lapp Mother, as quick as she could, gave her child a silver amulet. She put a knife in its cradle, and fastened silver buttons and other amulets to the three-stringed band that hung from the top of the cradle to its foot.</P>
<P>That frightened away the Uldas.</P>
