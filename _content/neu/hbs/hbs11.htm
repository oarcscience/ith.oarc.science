M<SMALL>URAD</SMALL> the tsar hath come in war down upon K&oacute;sovo;<BR>

He sent a letter to Kr&uacute;shevats that the tsar his will might know:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Ho, Lazar, lord of Servia, with sense it scarce accords,<BR>

That there should be one empery &#8217;neath the power of two lords,<BR>

One rayah that pays double tax! We cannot both rule here!<BR>

So render me up your city keys and the taxes for seven year.<BR>

But if thou wilt not send them, abide at K&oacute;sovo,<BR>

That to our hand we may sunder the land with a keen saber blow.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the fine-written letter Tsar Lazarus had read,<BR>

He looked upon the letter and bitter tears he shed.<BR>

Bitter was the tsar&#8217;s curse to hear; aye! and a word of woe:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Who comes not to the battle with me at K&oacute;sovo,<BR>

Let nothing grow beneath his hand in the field that he shall till;<BR>

Let not the white wheat spring in the field, nor the vine shoot on the hill!&#8221;<BR>

Lazar, the Tsar of Servia, holds his high holiday.<BR>

In the secret place, in Kr&uacute;shevats, with all his lords he lay.<BR>

All of the lords and lordings were come with him to dine:<BR>

At his right hand sat Yug Bogdan and Yug&#8217;s strong children nine;<BR>

On his left sat Vuk Br&aacute;nkovich; at the far end of the board,<BR>

With two more Servian vo&#253;vodas, was Milosh the young lord;<BR>

Ivan K&oacute;sanchich was the one, the other of the twain<BR>

Was Milan T&oacute;plitsa. And the tsar arose a health to drain<BR>

Unto the Servian nobles; he lifted the beaker up:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O vo&#253;vodas and captains, to whom shall I pledge this cup?<BR>

If I pledge it unto the oldest, to Yug shall I drink this hour;<BR>

I shall pledge it to Vuk Br&aacute;nkovich, if I drink because of power;<BR>

If I pledge to whomsoever is dear to me and mine,<BR>

I&#8217;ll drink to my good brethren, Yug Bogdan&#8217;s children nine;<BR>

For beauty to Ivan K&oacute;sanchich, and to Milan for his height;<BR>

But unto Milosh &Oacute;bilich for the glory of his might.<BR>

To none other will I drink it, while I have strength and breath:<BR>

<P>

A health unto Milosh Obilich, and faith and broken faith!<BR>

Faith first and treason to follow! To-morrow at K&oacute;sovo<BR>

Thou shalt betray me, and after to the tsar of the Turks shalt thou go.<BR>

Hail to thee, and a health to thee, and the cup&#8217;s delight be thine!<BR>

Rise up, Milosh the vo&#253;voda, and lightly drink the wine!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Milosh rose swiftly to his feet, and bowed to the black earth:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Praise to thee, Lazar the glorious, and a greeting to thy worth!<BR>

Praise for thy gift and greeting, but for thy speech no praise!<BR>

Since I was never a traitor, by my faith, in all my days,<BR>

Nor ever will work treason. But at K&oacute;sovo to-morn<BR>

Belike for the Cross of Christ and his Faith shall I be overborne.<BR>

But treachery is at thy knee, and drinketh before thy face;<BR>

There sits the traitor Br&aacute;nkovich, of the accurs&egrave;d race.<BR>

To-morrow on St. Vitus&#8217; day, on the field of K&oacute;sovo,<BR>

Who of us twain is true or false, all men shall clearly know.<A NAME="page_71_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_71_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A><BR>

An God me speed, will I ride indeed to K&oacute;sovo in the dawn,<BR>

To slash the throat of Murad the tsar and set my foot thereon.<BR>

An God give me good fortune, safely returning here,<BR>

I will lay hand on Br&aacute;nkovich, and bind him to this spear,<BR>

As flax on the long distaff is bound by a woman&#8217;s hand,<BR>

And to and fro in K&oacute;sovo will I bear him through the land.&#8221;<BR>

&#8220;Ho, brother Ivan K&oacute;sanchich, hast thou spied the Turks&#8217; array?<BR>

Have the Turks a mighty army? Can we beat them in the fray?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Quoth Ivan:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Milosh &Oacute;bilich, my own good brother dear,</TD></TR></TABLE>

I have spied the Turkish army, and a great host have they here.<BR>

Should all of us be changed to salt, we scarce should salt their meat.<BR>

Full fifteen days throughout their host have I walked with nimble feet,<BR>

Nor came on end or number, howsoever I might march;<BR>

From the marble to the maple, thence to S&aacute;zliya of the arch,<BR>

From the arched bridge to Zvechan the whole land have they ta&#8217;en;<BR>

From Zvechan through Chechan to the wood they seized the mount amain.<BR>

Ranks of horses and heroes, spears like a mountain wall,<BR>

And like the clouds of heaven are their banners over all;<BR>

And like the snows from heaven are their tents upon the plain;<BR>

And should a storm rise o&#8217;er them, on the earth it would not rain,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 74------------------------>

But on horses and on heroes would the rain fall from on high.<BR>

The tsar took Lab and S&iacute;tnitsa and Mazgit field thereby.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Still Milosh &Oacute;bilich questions him:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Ivan, brother in war,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Tell me where lieth, brother, the tent of Murad the tsar;<BR>

For unto the Tsar Lazarus my word is given and gone,<BR>

That I would slash Tsar Murad&#8217;s throat and set my foot thereon.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But Ivan answers him lightly:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Brother, a fool art thou!</TD></TR></TABLE>

Where in the center of the camp Tsar Murad lieth now,<BR>

Wert thou a wing&egrave;d goshawk from out high heaven sped,<BR>

Thou couldst not in thine anger hurt a hair upon his head.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Then Milosh speaketh to Ivan:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Ivan, my brother dear,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Speak not thus to Tsar Lazarus, lest he and the host should fear;<BR>

But unto the Tsar Lazarus thus and thus shalt thou say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Strong are the Turks, but we, mayhap, will shake them in the fray,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 75------------------------>

<A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A>

</P>

And lightly overcome them, for no host of battle they are,<BR>

But priests and pilgrims and merchants, and knaves that know not war,<BR>

That are come abroad together to eat Tsar Murad&#8217;s bread.<BR>

And for the royal army, the half are well-nigh dead<BR>

From the grievous ill of heartache, that is a bitter pain,<BR>

And the good steeds of that army are glandered on the plain.&#8217;&#8201;&#8221;<BR>

&#8220;Who is the great hero that lifted once his hand,<BR>

And sundered well twelve Turkish heads with the edges of the brand?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;&#8220;That is the brave Ban Strahin.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;What hero cometh here,</TD></TR></TABLE>

That spitteth the Moslems two and two on the edges of his spear,<BR>

And driveth them before him to S&iacute;tnitsa&#8217;s gray tide?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;That is Srija the champion, whom men call the Angry-Eyed.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;What hero on a white steed bears the flag of the cross in his hands,<BR>

And all along he harries the flying Turks in bands,<BR>

And chases them in his anger to S&iacute;tnitsa the flood?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;That is Boshko the captain, of old Yug Bogdan&#8217;s blood.&#8221;<BR>
