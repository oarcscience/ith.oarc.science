<H2 ALIGN="center">PRINCE MARKO AND MINA OF KOSTUR</H2>

P<SMALL>RINCE</SMALL> M<SMALL>ARKO</SMALL> and his mother had sat them down to dine;<BR>

On the dry bread they feasted, and they drank the yellow wine.<BR>

And unto the prince Marko came letters three that day:<BR>

One was from Bajaz&eacute;t the tsar, in white Stamboul that lay;<BR>

One from the town of Budim, from the king thereof had come;<BR>

And one from Yanko the vo&#253;voda, in Sibin that had his home.<BR>

The letter from Stamboul city, that was written of the tsar,<BR>

To the army summons Marko for the keen Moorish war.<BR>

In the letter out of Budim, the second of the three,<BR>

The king with the wooers bids him that the groomsman he may be,<BR>

That the king may lightly marry the queen of whom he is fain.<BR>

The letter from Sibin the city, it beareth a message plain,<BR>

That as godfather he shall christen the children of Yanko twain.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Marko speaks to his mother:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My mother, old art thou;</TD></TR></TABLE>

Council me, mother, shall I go to the tsar&#8217;s army now?<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 153------------------------>

<A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A>

</P>

Shall I go among the wooers, to marry the king amain?<BR>

Or unto Yanko of Sibin, to christen his children twain?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;His mother speaketh to Marko: &#8220;My little son,&#8221; saith she,<BR>

&#8220;A man goes unto the wooers because of jollity;<BR>

As a godfather a man goes forth because of the law of God;<BR>

But a man goes to the army because of the fear of the rod.<BR>

Go, my son, to the army, for God will hold his hand;<BR>

But the Turks, an thou come not thither, they will not understand.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko obeyed his mother. To the host he marched away;<BR>

He took Gol&uacute;ban the servant; to his mother did he say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Hear, mother! Of my fortress do thou early shut the gate,<BR>

And when ariseth the morning, do thou throw it open late;<BR>

Since with Mina accurst of Kostur at odds am I, and I fear,<BR>

Mother, that my white houses the rogue will plunder here.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko to the tsar&#8217;s army with Gol&uacute;ban the servant went.<BR>

On the third evening of the march, when they had pitched the tent,<BR>

<P>

Marko supped, and Gol&uacute;ban served out the yellow wine.<BR>

Marko took up the goblet, and slumber fell on his eyne;<BR>

He dropped the cup on the table, but the wine spilled not on the board.<BR>

Gol&uacute;ban the servant waketh him; &#8220;Prince Marko,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;my lord,<BR>

Ere this hast thou gone to the army, but thou hast not slumbered so deep,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Nor dropped the cup from thy fingers.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>But Marko started from sleep,</TD></TR></TABLE>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Gol&uacute;ban, my servant, thou art faithful, as I deem.</TD></TR></TABLE>

I closed mine eyes for a little, and I dreamed a wondrous dream.<BR>

Exceeding strange was the dream, and exceeding strange the hour.<BR>

A tuft of mist blew outward from Kostur the white tower:<BR>

The mist enveloped Prilip; in the white mist Mina came.<BR>

He will plunder my white houses and burn them with the flame;<BR>

Over my mother&#8217;s body will he trample with the steed;<BR>

My faithful bride upon that tide a captive will he lead;<BR>

My horses from the stables, he will drive them all away;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 155------------------------>

</P>

The money in my treasury he will carry off that day.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;To Marko said Gol&uacute;ban: &#8220;Fear not, Prince Marko. In sooth,<BR>

Good heroes ever dreamed good dreams. Dreams lie, but God is truth.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When they were come to Ts&aacute;rigrad,<A NAME="page_155_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_155_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> the tsar sent forth his host,<BR>

Over the blue sea went they forth to the fierce Moorish coast;<BR>

And four and forty cities have they ta&#8217;en over sea.<BR>

They came under Kara Okan, and years they fought there three;<BR>

Okan they smote, and never could they storm it in the war.<BR>

Marko smote down the Moorish chiefs and bore their heads to the tsar.<BR>

The tsar gave bakshish to Marko, and wroth the Turks did it make;<BR>

And they came in anger to the tsar, and unto him they spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Tsar Bajaz&eacute;t, this Marko, no hero at all is he;<BR>

He cleaveth and bringeth for bakshish the heads of the slain to thee.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko heard it, and forthwith to the great tsar did he pray:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My father by adoption, to-morrow is the day<BR>

Of St. George, my own good patron, and let me, tsar, withdraw<BR>

To hold my patron&#8217;s festival by custom and by law;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 156------------------------>

<A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A>

</P>

And Alil Aga, my brother sworn, likewise do thou release,<BR>

That he and I together may drink the wine in peace.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The tsar sent forth Prince Marko, for naught else could he do,<BR>

To hold his patron&#8217;s festival, and released his brother too.<BR>

And into the green forest forthwith Prince Marko sped,<BR>

Nor far from the tsar&#8217;s army his white pavilion spread;<BR>

To tipple on dark liquor he sat him on the grass,<BR>

And with him Alil Aga, his brother sworn that was.<BR>

And the Moorish watch discovered, when the fair daybreak shone,<BR>

How forth from the tsar&#8217;s army Marko the Prince was gone.<BR>

Then shouted all the Moorish watch: &#8220;O furious Moors, set on!<BR>

The hero on the great gray steed&#8212;the terrible is gone!&#8221;<BR>

The Moors set on, and of the host slew thirty thousand men;<BR>

And the tsar wrote a letter unto Prince Marko then:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My good son by adoption, come quickly here again,<BR>

For thirty thousand men of mine have been in battle slain!&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 157------------------------>

<A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;But Marko said: &#8220;How then may I come quickly, father mine?<BR>

For as yet I have not drunken my fill of the yellow wine,<BR>

And much less have I started my holiday to hold.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And lo, upon the morrow, when broke the morning cold,<BR>

Then shouted all the Moorish watch: &#8220;O furious Moors, set on!<BR>

The hero on the great gray steed&#8212;the terrible is gone!&#8221;<BR>

The Moors set on, and of the host slew sixty thousand men;<BR>

Once more the great Tsar Bajaz&eacute;t wrote to Prince Marko then:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My good son by adoption, come quickly here again,<BR>

For sixty thousand men of mine have been in battle slain!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But Marko said: &#8220;My father, a little must thou wait;<BR>

I have not yet regaled my friends as well befits their state.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;On the third day shouted the Moorish watch: &#8220;O furious Moors, set on!<BR>

The hero on the great gray steed&#8212;the terrible is gone!&#8221;<BR>

The Moors set on, and slaughtered an hundred thousand men;<BR>

And the tsar wrote a letter unto Prince Marko then:<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 158------------------------>

<A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;&#8220;Before God for my foster child thee, Marko, will I own;<BR>

Come very quickly, for the Moors my camp have overthrown!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko mounted on Dapple, he rode to the tsar&#8217;s array;<BR>

When day broke, the two armies they clashed in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.<BR>

When the Moorish watch saw Marko, they cried: &#8220;Ye Moors, begone!<BR>

The hero on the great gray steed&#8212;the terrible, comes on!&#8221;<BR>

Marko smote on the Moorish host; three ways their host he drave.<BR>

He slashed throughout one army with the edges of the glaive,<BR>

The second of the armies on Dapple he trampled o&#8217;er<BR>

And herded the third before the tsar. But Marko was wounded sore;<BR>

Seventy wounds at the Moors&#8217; hands on Marko&#8217;s body there are.<BR>

On the tsar&#8217;s breast falleth Marko, and to him saith the tsar:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Marko, my good foster child, by thy wounds now art thou slain?<BR>

Can the doctors with their wrappings recover thee again?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Prince Marko then made answer: &#8220;No deadly wounds they are,<BR>

And I deem that I shall recover.&#8221; And thereupon the tsar<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 159------------------------>

<A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A>

</P>

Thrust hand into pouch and to him a thousand ducats gave,<BR>

That the Prince Marko might go forth his wounds to heal and lave;<BR>

And the tsar sends forth two faithful lads, lest Marko the Prince should die.<BR>

But Marko sought not a doctor; from inn to inn did he hie,<BR>

And ever sought Prince Marko where the best wine was to drain.<BR>

Scarce had he drunk his fill thereof, when his wounds were healed again.<BR>

&#8195;But a fine-written letter to the Prince Marko came,<BR>

That his houses all were plundered and ravaged with the flame,<BR>

And the body of his mother trampled over by the steed,<BR>

And his faithful wife a captive his enemy did lead.<BR>

Then Marko mourned and to the tsar, his foster father, said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My foster father, my white house is ravaged in the raid;<BR>

My faithful bride upon this tide a captive do they lead;<BR>

Over my mother&#8217;s body have they trampled with the steed;<BR>

The money in my treasury is stolen from me this day:<BR>

Mina of Kostur, he it was who carried it away.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>The tsar spake comfort:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>

</TD></TR><TR><TD><TD>&#8220;Foster son, my Marko, do not fear.</TD></TR></TABLE>

If these thine houses have been burned, I will build thee better here;<BR>

Beside my houses and like to mine shall they be built for thee.<BR>

If thy gold is stolen, a farmer of my taxes shalt thou be,<BR>

And thou shalt gather treasure. If thy wife is led away,<BR>

I will give thee a better lady upon the wedding day.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said Marko:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My foster father, glory to thee again!</TD></TR></TABLE>

When thou buildest the houses for me, orphans will curse me then,<BR>

Saying: &#8216;This rascal Marko, his houses were burned of late;<BR>

Now may these new-built for him be likewise desolate!&#8217;<BR>

If thou makest me farmer of taxes, till I bind poor, needy men,<BR>

I cannot gather the taxes, and orphans will curse me then,<BR>

Saying: &#8216;This rascal Marko, what gold he had of late<BR>

Was stolen; what he hath presently, may it too be desolate!&#8217;<BR>

To another how wilt thou wed me, while yet my wife doth live?&#8212;<BR>

Three hundred janissaries I prithee to me give;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 161------------------------>

<A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A>

</P>

Forge for them crooked pruning hooks and of slender hoes no lack;<BR>

And to white Kostur will I go, if perchance I may win her back.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Three hundred janissaries were his at the tsar&#8217;s command;<BR>

The tsar forged crooked pruning hooks and slender hoes to their hand.<BR>

To the three hundred Marko his counsel gave aright:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Go, my three hundred brethren; go now to Kostur the white.<BR>

When ye are come to Kostur, the Greeks will be merry thus:<BR>

&#8216;Here are laborers; cheap enow will they tend our vines for us!&#8217;<BR>

But do ye naught, my brethren. Abide in Kostur the town;<BR>

Drink the clear wine and brandy, till thither I come down.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The three hundred janissaries they went to Kostur the white,<BR>

But Marko to Mount Athos, unto the holy height;<BR>

And there he took communion and moreover did confess<BR>

For the blood he had shed, then clad him in a black c&aacute;loyer&#8217;s<A NAME="page_161_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_161_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> dress;<BR>

He let his beard to the girdle grow, and a monk&#8217;s hat put on his head.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 162------------------------>

Then he leaped to the back of Dapple, to Kostur the white he sped.<BR>

When he came to Mina of Kostur, there Mina sat to dine,<BR>

And Marko&#8217;s wife served Mina the cups of yellow wine:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, thou black c&aacute;loyer,&#8221; did Mina to him say,<BR>

&#8220;Tell me, prithee, where gottest thou the little dapple gray?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Prince Marko said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Friend Mina, by the true God do I swear,</TD></TR></TABLE>

In the fierce Moorish country, with the tsar&#8217;s host was I there.<BR>

There was a fool, Prince Marko, that dying there I saw,<BR>

And I buried him according to our custom and our law.<BR>

A gift for his soul&#8217;s salvation they gave this steed to me.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When Mina of Kostur heard it, he leaped up joyfully,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Nine years have I waited until these tidings came!</TD></TR></TABLE>

For Marko&#8217;s house have I plundered and ravaged with the flame;<BR>

His faithful wife have I made a slave, but I would not break her vow,<BR>

Black priest, till Marko perished, and thou shalt marry me now!&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 163------------------------>

<A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;Up Marko took the holy book, and thereupon did wed<BR>

Mina unto the woman he had ta&#8217;en to his own bed.<BR>

Then sat they down to speak fair words and drink the yellow wine.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said Mina:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Hearest thou, Y&eacute;litsa, O heart and soul of mine?</TD></TR></TABLE>

Till now wast thou Marko&#8217;s lady; henceforth thou art Mina&#8217;s wife!<BR>

Go now to the treasure house below, I prithee, soul of my life,<BR>

And bring three cups of ducats to give the c&aacute;loyer black.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Y&eacute;litsa brought from the treasure three cups of ducats back;<BR>

She took not Mina&#8217;s money, but Marko&#8217;s. A rusty glaive<BR>

She brought up with the money, and to the priest she gave:<BR>

&#8220;Here is for thee, black c&aacute;loyer, a gift for Marko&#8217;s sake.&#8221;<BR>

Marko took up the saber, and looked at it, and spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Mina, the lord of Kostur, is it seemly in thine eyes,<BR>

To dance here at thy wedding after the monkish wise?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Quoth Mina of Kostur to him: &#8220;Black c&aacute;loyer, to thee<BR>

Surely it is permitted. Wherefore should it not be?&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 164------------------------>

<A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;Marko leaped on his nimble feet twice and thrice him about;<BR>

The tower&#8217;s foundations trembled as he drew the saber out.<BR>

He drew the rusty saber, he swung it left and right;<BR>

The head from Mina&#8217;s shoulders at one stroke did he smite.<BR>

From his white throat he shouted: &#8220;Lord Mina&#8217;s days are done;<BR>

Ho, all my janissaries! my laborers, come on!&#8221;<BR>

Three hundred janissaries through Mina&#8217;s mansions came;<BR>

They plundered his white palace and ravaged it with flame.<BR>

Marko brought home his faithful wife and Mina&#8217;s horde along,<BR>

And went unto white Prilip with chanting and with song.<BR>
