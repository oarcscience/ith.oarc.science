<H2 align=center>THE BUILDING OF RAV&Aacute;NITSA</H2>

To celebrate the holy tide, Tsar Lazarus is gone<BR>

To Kr&uacute;shevats, the fortress of many-colored stone;<BR>

To the birthfeast of St. Amos he summons all the lords<BR>

By letter and salutation that with their rank accords.<BR>

And all the lords of Servia were gathered at that place.<BR>

He set them at the tables, by greatness and by grace.<BR>

At the head of the good table the good Tsar Lazar sat;<BR>

The lords were set beside him to drink the wine thereat;<BR>

And they spake of all good tidings what time the wine ran free.<BR>

&#8195;Ts&aacute;ritsa M&iacute;litsa stepped forth, and through the hall came she.<BR>

Girded was she with girdles nine, nine chains her neck did fold,<BR>

Nine pendants hung about her brows from the coronet of gold,<BR>

And the three summits of the crown were set with a precious stone<BR>

That shone by night as broad and bright as in the day the sun.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And she spoke to the glorious Lazarus:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Abashed am I to-day</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>

</P>

Only to look on thee, Lazarus; and more this word to say&#8212;<BR>

I cannot help it, I must speak forth. N&eacute;manya&#8217;s sons of old,<BR>

They were our tsars in word and deed, and all their days are told.<BR>

They heaped not treasure up in hills, but to God reared many a fane;<BR>

They builded their good monasteries on the mountain and the plain;<BR>

They reared o&#8217;er J&aacute;kovitsa D&eacute;chani on the height,<BR>

The Patriarch&#8217;s Place at level Pech,<A NAME="page_28_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_28_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> and in Dr&eacute;nitsa the white<BR>

Did they raise the Devich; near Pazar St. Peter&#8217;s Church they set,<BR>

And the great Pillars of St. George on the mount, higher yet;<BR>

They builded S&oacute;pochani over the Rashka cold,<BR>

And the Cathedral of St. Anne they wrought in Vlah the Old;<BR>

Stud&eacute;nitsa &#8217;neath Brivenik; &#8217;neath Y&aacute;dovnik, St. Paul;<BR>

O&#8217;er K&aacute;ranovats the fair church that Zhicha men do call.<BR>

The Chapel of Good Friday on Prizrend did they bestow;<BR>

And they reared Gr&aacute;chanitsa on level K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

All these are their foundations. In their place thou reignest now;<BR>

<P>

No churches hast thou founded, yet a treasure of gold hast thou.<BR>

The treasure availeth nothing to help us or to heal;<BR>

Neither for soul or body will treasure work our weal.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Then rose up Lazar the glorious:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My great lords, harken ye</TD></TR></TABLE>

What saith my queen, that nowhere a church builded have we!<BR>

Rav&aacute;nitsa in R&eacute;sava by the Ravan will I rear,<BR>

For treasure in my treasuries whate&#8217;er I need is here.<BR>

Leaden shall be the corner stones, and the walls of silver white;<BR>

I will cover the walls of it with the gold burnished bright.<BR>

And moreover, by God&#8217;s mercy, shall pearls be set thereon,<BR>

And the gateways of the chapels shall glow with precious stone.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The Servian lords rose lightly; they bowed down one and all:<BR>

&#8220;Build for the sake of thine own soul and the health of Stevan the Tall.&#8221;<A NAME="page_29_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_29_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A><BR>

&#8195;But Milosh &Oacute;bilich sat there at the table foot to dine,<BR>

<P>

</P>

And naught he said; and Lazar saw, and pledged him in the wine:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Hail to thee, Milosh the vo&#253;voda! What then to me wilt thou say?<BR>

For I think to build to our Lord God a mighty church this day.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Milosh rose up and doffed the cap with the plumes and sable fine,<BR>

And he made obeisance to the tsar, and they gave him the cup of wine.<BR>

Milosh took up the golden cup, and gave his health again:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Glory to thee, prince, for thy speech, but for building of the fane&#8212;<BR>

This is no time for building. In faith, it cannot be!<BR>

My lord, but look in the ancient book what it shall say to thee.<BR>

The last hour is upon us; swift it cometh apace.<BR>

The Turks will take the kingdom and rule it in our place.<BR>

They will sack church and convent, and Rav&aacute;nitsa likewise.<BR>

The foundations of Rav&aacute;nitsa, they will dig them for a prize,<BR>

And melt them into cannon balls, to beat and batter down<BR>

The bulwarks of our churches and the rampart of the town.<BR>

For trappings the whitesilver walls shall be molten in the flames;<BR>

<P>

They will overthrow the church roof for necklets for their dames;<BR>

For these same necklaces, I wot, they will wrench away the pearls;<BR>

For their sword hilts will they take the gems, and for rings for Turkish girls.<BR>

But hark to me, Tsar Lazar! Let us quarry out the stone<BR>

And build a church of marble. For the Turks will seize the throne,<BR>

And our church shall serve forever, unto God&#8217;s Judgment Day!<BR>

There is no profit in the stone, to carry it away.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Then spake the great Tsar Lazarus, when he that speech had heard:<BR>

&#8220;Now glory to thee, Milosh, for truth is in thy word!&#8221;<BR>
