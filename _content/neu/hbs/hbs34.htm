<H2 ALIGN="center">HOW STAR&Iacute;NA NOVAK BECAME A HAYDUK</H2>

N<SMALL>OVAK</SMALL> and Rado drank the wine near Bosna the river cold,<BR>

With B&oacute;gosav. When they had drunk as much as they could hold,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Prince Bogosav began to speak:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Star&iacute;na Novak,&#8221; said he,</TD></TR></TABLE>

&#8220;My brother sworn, now speak the truth, so may God prosper thee!<BR>

Why didst thou join the outlaws? What constraint on thee was laid<BR>

To go to the wood to break thy neck, and to ply a wretched trade?<BR>

And in thine age, moreover, when thy season was past and sped?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Star&iacute;na Novak spake to him:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Prince B&oacute;gosav,&#8221; he said,</TD></TR></TABLE>

&#8220;My brother sworn, since thou askest me, I will even tell thee the truth;<BR>

But it was through a hard constraint that I fled, in very sooth.<BR>

Thou mayst remember, when Y&eacute;rina did Sm&eacute;derevo rear,<BR>

She made me a day laborer. I labored there three year.<BR>

Wood and stone did I haul for her with my oxen and my wain,<BR>

And in the space of full three years not a penny did I gain;<BR>

Not even bark sandals for my feet could I win my labor by.<BR>

And that I should have pardoned her. When the town was builded high,<BR>

She would build towers and gild the doors and windows of the hold.<BR>

Each house in the vilayet she taxed three measures of gold,<BR>

That is three hundred ducats. Who gave, in the place might live;<BR>

But I was poverty-stricken, and had no gold to give.<BR>

With the mattock, wherewith I had labored, to the outlaws I fled amain.<BR>

I could not stay where Y&eacute;rina, the accurs&egrave;d one, did reign,<BR>

But ran to the cold Drina, and to rocky Bosnia fled.<BR>

When I came near Rom&aacute;niya, there Turkish wooers led<BR>

A Turkish damsel homeward. In peace they passed by me.<BR>

There remained the Turkish bridegroom; on a great brown steed was he.<BR>

In peace that Turkish bridegroom he would not let me pass,<BR>

But forth he drew a triple whip with three knobs of yellow brass.<BR>

Thrice he smote me on the shoulders. Thrice I prayed him in God&#8217;s name:<BR>

<P>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;I pray thee, Turkish bridegroom, mayst thou have courage and fame!<BR>

Mayst thou have a happy marriage, but pass me by in peace!<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Thou seest how poor a man am I.&#8217;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;But the bridegroom would not cease;</TD></TR></TABLE>

But rather in his anger began to smite the more.<BR>

Then at last was I angry, for my shoulders were waxen sore.<BR>

With the mattock on my shoulder, the bridegroom did I smite<BR>

With one blow from the brown steed&#8217;s back, though the stroke was passing light.<BR>

And then I leaped upon him, and smote him where he lay,<BR>

Twice or thrice, till his spirit from the body fled away.<BR>

I reached my hand in his pockets, and there found purses three;<BR>

I put them in my bosom, and girt his saber on me.<BR>

I left the mattock at his head that the Turks might have withal<BR>

Something to bury him with; the steed I mounted, brown and tall.<BR>

To the wood of Rom&aacute;niya I went; the wooers saw me there;<BR>

But wished not to pursue me, or haply did not dare.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;It is forly year. The forest is better known to me<BR>

Than the house of my habitation was ever wont to be.<BR>

The roads across the mountains I watch them and I hold.<BR>

From the youths of S&aacute;rayevo I take their silver and gold,<BR>

And their linen and velvet for me and mine; and I can go abroad<BR>

And stand in the place of danger, for I fear none but God.&#8221;<BR>
