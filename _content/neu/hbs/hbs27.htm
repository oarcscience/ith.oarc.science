<H2 ALIGN="center">PRINCE MARKO AND BEY KOSTADIN</H2>

P<SMALL>RINCE</SMALL> M<SMALL>ARKO</SMALL> and Bey Kost&aacute;din, brothers in God were they;<BR>

They rode their steeds together. Outspoke Kost&aacute;din the Bey:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Prince Marko, now I prithee, thou art my brother sworn;<BR>

Come to me in the autumn, on St. Demetrius&#8217; morn,<BR>

The feast day of my patron saint. Much honor wilt thou see,<BR>

And a fair feast and a welcome becoming my degree.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said Marko:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Boast not of thy feast! When I sought for my brother born,</TD></TR></TABLE>

&Aacute;ndriya, I dwelt in autumn with thee. On St. Demetrius&#8217; morn,<BR>

The feast day of thy patron saint, I saw the feast of thy pride,<BR>

And also in the selfsame hour three cruel deeds beside.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Said Bey Kost&aacute;din: &#8220;Marko, my brother sworn art thou;<BR>

Say to me of what cruel deeds thou speakest to me now.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said Marko:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;The first cruel deed after this wise befell.</TD></TR></TABLE>

There came two orphans unto thee that thou mightst feed them well<BR>

With the white bread, and give them the ruddy wine to drain.<BR>

But thou saidst: &#8216;Ye mere scull of the earth, now get you hence amain!<BR>

Ye shall not defile the wine before my gentlefolk this day.&#8217;<BR>

Bey, I pitied the orphans and with them went away;<BR>

And I took them to the market and fed them on white bread,<BR>

And gave them to drink of the ruddy wine, and clad them in satin red,<BR>

And in green silk moreover. Unto thy house again<BR>

I sent them, and looked to see thee, how them thou wouldst entertain.<BR>

One thou tookest on either hand; to the table thou leddest them then:<BR>

&#8216;Eat and drink,&#8217; thou saidst, &#8216;ye sons of gentlemen!&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Thy second cruel deed was this. When ancient squires forlorn<BR>

Came there, who had lost their money, and whose scarlet was outworn,<BR>

Thou evermore didst set them at the foot of the table there;<BR>

But whoso of the younger squires at thy festival that were,<BR>

Who had gained new hordes of money, and whose scarlet was fresh and new,<BR>

Evermore thou broughtest them the head of the board unto;<BR>

<P>

</P>

Thou didst pour the wine and brandy before them fast and free;<BR>

There was a feast and welcome, befitting thy degree.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;This is thy third cruel deed, O bey. Father and mother are thine;<BR>

Neither is ever at thy board nor draineth first the wine.&#8221;<BR>
