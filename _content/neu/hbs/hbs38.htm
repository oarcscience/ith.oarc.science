<H2 ALIGN="center">THE CAPTIVITY OF STOYAN Y&Aacute;NKOVICH</H2>

W<SMALL>HEN</SMALL> the Turks took Kot&aacute;ri, great havoc did they make<BR>

With the house of Y&aacute;nkovich &Iacute;liya Sm&iacute;lyanich did they take<BR>

And likewise Stoyan Y&aacute;nkovich; bereft was &Iacute;liya&#8217;s bride<BR>

Of fifteen days; ungently from his wife&#8217;s youthful side<BR>

Was Stoyan taken also, ere a week they had been wed.<BR>

The Turks to Stamboul city captive the husbands led.<BR>

To the tsar whom all men honor, with the prisoners of their spears<BR>

Came the Turks; and the two were holden for the space of nine long years<BR>

And seven months. And Moslems the tsar hath made them there,<BR>

And likewise built them houses beside his palace fair.<BR>

&#8195;Spake &Iacute;liya Sm&iacute;lyanich: &#8220;Stoyan, dear brother,&#8221; did he say,<BR>

&#8220;To-morrow will be Friday, the Turkish holiday;<BR>

The ts&aacute;ritsa walks with the Turkish dames and the tsar with the Turks at heel.<BR>

Do thou steal the key of the treasury, and the stable key will I steal;<BR>

Let us gather the guardless treasure and take two steeds amain,<BR>

And run to level Kot&aacute;ri and see our wives again,<BR>

<P>

That never enemy caressed nor foeman carried away.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;They harkened each other. On the morn of the Turkish holiday<BR>

The ts&aacute;ritsa walked with the Turkish dames and the tsar with the Turks at heel.<BR>

One stole the treasury key, and one did the key of the stable steal;<BR>

They took much treasure and two good steeds, and to flat Kot&aacute;ri fled.<BR>

When they were near Kot&aacute;ri, Stoyan Y&aacute;nkovich said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O &Iacute;liya, my dear brother, unto the white house go;<BR>

And I will unto the vineyard that mine own hand did sow,<BR>

That I may look on the vineyard, to see who binds the vine<BR>

And prunes it&#8212;in whose possession the place has gone from mine.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;To the white house went &Iacute;liya, to the vineyard Stoyan came;<BR>

In the vineyard he found his mother, the weary and ancient dame.<BR>

And standing in the vineyard she cut the strands of her hair,<BR>

And with them to the stanchions she bound the grapevines there,<BR>

And with tears she watered the vine sprouts and the tendrils where they twined,<BR>

And ever her own son Stoyan was present in her mind:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Stoyan, my golden apple, is forgot of his mother old;<BR>

But I will remember Yela his wife, fair as the unworn gold!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Stoyan in God&#8217;s name greeted her: &#8220;Old dame, whom God defend!&#8212;<BR>

Hast thou none younger than thyself for thee the vines to tend?<BR>

Thou totterest wretched and feeble.&#8221; But bravely she replied:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Live well, thou unknown champion, and all good thee betide!<BR>

I have none younger save Stoyan, sole son of my desire.<BR>

The Turks took him with &Iacute;liya, the nephew of his sire;<BR>

And in that bitter hour bereft was &Iacute;liya&#8217;s bride<BR>

Of fifteen days; ungently from his wife&#8217;s youthful side<BR>

Was Stoyan taken also, ere a week they had been wed.<BR>

My daughter of Adam waited until nine years were sped,<BR>

And seven months of the tenth year; she weds another to-day.<BR>

And I&#8212;I could not endure it; to the vineyard I ran away!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When Stoyan understood it, he went to the white house,<BR>

And well the wooers welcomed him with revel and carouse.<BR>

He went from the steed to table, his thirst with wine to slake;<BR>

When he had drunk his fill of it, softly to them he spake:<BR>

&#8220;My brothers, gay-clad wooers, to sing is it granted me?&#8221;<BR>

Said the wooers: &#8220;It is, thou hero unknown; wherefore should it not be?&#8221;<BR>

Then Stoyan sang unto them in a high voice and a clear:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;A swallow plaited her fair nest; she plaited her nest nine year;<BR>

To-morrow will she unplait it. But there flew to her from afar<BR>

A mighty falcon green and gray, from the city of the tsar;<BR>

And the mighty falcon green and gray lets her not unplait the nest.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;In all this to the wooers was nothing manifest,<BR>

But the inward of the matter the wife of Stoyan spied.<BR>

Thereupon she departed from the bringer of the bride;<BR>

She went to the lookout place and spoke to Stoyan&#8217;s sister dear:<BR>

&#8220;Sister-in-law, my sister, thy brother my lord is here!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the sister of Stoyan heard it, she ran from the lookout place;<BR>

Thrice she looked round the table, till she saw her brother&#8217;s face.<BR>

When she saw the face of her brother, wide then their arms they spread;<BR>

They kissed each other on the face, and the sweet tears they shed;<BR>

One washes the cheeks of the other with the tears of their desire.<BR>

But the gay-clad wooers said: &#8220;Stoyan, what get we for our hire?<BR>

For we spent a deal of money ere we won thy wife to wed.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Stand aside, gay-clad wooers,&#8221; Stoyan Y&aacute;nkovich said,<BR>

&#8220;Until I have gazed on my sister! We will look to your money then;<BR>

Easily shall we pay it, if we in truth be men.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When he had gazed on her, gifts he gave unto the wooers there;<BR>

A kerchief to one, to another a shirt of linen fair;<BR>

To the bridegroom he gave his sister: and the wooers went their way.<BR>

&#8195;Wailing came home the mother at the ending of the day,<BR>

Wailing even as a cuckoo the hawthorn leaves behind,<BR>

And ever her son Stoyan was present in her mind:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Stoyan, my golden apple, is forgot of his mother old;<BR>

But I will remember Yela his wife, fair as the unworn gold!<BR>

Who will wait for the ancient mother? Who will come forth for me,<BR>

<P>

And say to the weary woman, &#8216;Hath thy toil wearied thee?&#8217;&#8201;&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the wife of Stoyan heard it, before the house she sped;<BR>

She took her mother in her sweet arms, and to the dame she said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Wail not, O ancient mother! On thee has the warm sun shone,<BR>

For returned unto thy bosom is Stoyan, thy only son.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;She looked on her son Stoyan, and dead on the earth she fell.<BR>

And Stoyan buried his mother most royally and well.<BR>
