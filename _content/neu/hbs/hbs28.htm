<H2 ALIGN="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE MOORISH KING</H2>

<TABLE><TR><TD>H<SMALL>IS</SMALL> mother asks Prince Marko:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Marko, my little son,</TD></TR></TABLE>

So many monasteries wherefore hast thou begun?<BR>

Hast thou sinned before God? Or by good hap hast thou won the gold abroad?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Marko of Prilip answered:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;I will tell in the name of God.</TD></TR></TABLE>

Once, when I was in the Moorish land, at dawn to a cistern fair<BR>

I went, that Dapple might drink thereof; and behold, at the water there,<BR>

Were twelve Moors. Out of my due time I wished to water the steed;<BR>

The twelve Moors would not let me, and a battle did we breed.<BR>

Thereat I drew the heavy mace, and smote a black Moor down.<BR>

We smote against each other, eleven against one.<BR>

Two I smote down, and ten of them came furiously at me.<BR>

Then nine of them must I abide, for I had stricken three.<BR>

The fourth fell; eight were the champions against me that did drive.<BR>

But I struck again; on the red ground lay ruddy corpses five.<BR>

I slew the sixth, but was taken by the six that were left alive.<BR>

They bound me, and they bore me to the Moorish king along;<BR>

And the king of the Moors threw me into the dungeon strong.<BR>

Seven years was I in it: when summer was at hand<BR>

I knew not, nor when winter had come across the land;<BR>

Except that, when in winter the girls the snowballs cast,<BR>

Then would they toss a snowball into the dungeon fast;<BR>

And then I knew it was winter, as I lay within the tower.<BR>

In the summer, they would throw me a sprig of basil flower,<BR>

And I knew it was summer. The eighth year in prison that I was,<BR>

I wearied not of prison, but of a Moorish lass.<BR>

Unto the Moorish Sultan the daughter dear was she;<BR>

Night and morn to the window of the tower she summoned me:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Marko, poor lad, in the dungeon I prithee rot not here,<BR>

But give true pledge thou wilt take me to be thy true love dear,<BR>

If I free thee from the dungeon, and thy Dapple from the hold.<BR>

Marko, unto thy heart&#8217;s desire will I gather ducats of gold.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;When I saw that might was against me, and strength compelling me,<BR>

I took my cap from off my head, and swore to it on my knee,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>A firm pledge to the cap I swore:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8216;Thee I will never leave;</TD></TR></TABLE>

A firm pledge, and moreover, ne&#8217;er will I thee deceive.<BR>

E&#8217;en the sun is false; he warms not winter as summertide&#8212;<BR>

Never will I renounce the pledge; thereby will I abide.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Then thought the Moorish maiden that unto her I swore.<BR>

One night, at fall of darkness, she opened the dungeon door<BR>

And led me out of the dungeon, and Dapple from the hold,<BR>

And a better horse for herself. On both were holsters full of gold;<BR>

She brought a silver-hilted sword. On the horses we laid hand,<BR>

And forthwith galloped onward over the Moorish land.<BR>

When the dawn shone, my mother, I sat me down to rest;<BR>

And the Moorish maid, with her black arms she clasped me to her breast.<BR>

When I looked on her, my mother, she was black and her teeth were white,<BR>

And it was a thing unpleasing and dreadful in my sight.<BR>

The silver-hilted saber forth from the sheath I drew;<BR>

I smote her under her silken belt; the blade cut through and through.<BR>

I seized on Dapple; still the head of the Moorish maid spake on:<BR>

&#8216;My brother Marko, wretched lad, leave me not here alone.&#8217;<BR>

Then, mother, I sinned in the sight of God, but gained much gold and gear,<BR>

Whereby the monasteries and churches fair I rear.&#8221;<BR>
