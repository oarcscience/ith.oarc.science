<H2 ALIGN="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE VILA</H2>

Two sworn brothers were riding over Miroch, the mountain fair;<BR>

Vo&#253;voda Milosh and Marko were the two heroes there.<BR>

Side by side the steeds did they ride as they bore the spears that day;<BR>

One kissed the face of the other: such loving brothers were they.<BR>

Then Marko on Dapple yearned to sleep; he spake to his brother sworn:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Vo&#253;voda Milosh, heavily by sleep am I overborne.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Sing to me, brother, and cheer me.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Prince Marko, brother mine,&#8221;</TD></TR></TABLE>

Said Milosh, &#8220;I would sing to thee, but, Marko, I drank the wine<BR>

In the mountain with Rav&iacute;yoyla, the vila, yesternight.<BR>

She forbade me; if she hears me, my throat and heart will she smite.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Prince Marko spake: &#8220;Sing brother, nor ever the vila fear,<BR>

While Dapple and I and the war-club with six gold knobs are here.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Then sang Milosh, the vo&#253;voda, a great and beautiful song<BR>

Of our elders and our betters that held the kingdom long<BR>

<P>

In famous Macedonia, and the troop that with each did go.<BR>

The song was pleasing to Marko, and he bowed on the saddlebow.<BR>

Prince Marko slept in the saddle, and Milosh sang on the track;<BR>

And the vila Rav&iacute;yoyla heard him, and sang in answer back.<BR>

Milosh sang, and the vila again unto him sang.<BR>

The better voice had Milosh, and angrily she sprang<BR>

Away to the mountain Miroch; with two white arrows she smote<BR>

Vo&#253;voda Milosh through the heart and likewise in the throat.<A NAME="page_121_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_121_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A><BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Said Milosh:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Alas, my mother! And woe unto Marko, too!</TD></TR></TABLE>

Alas, my brother, the vila has shot me through and through!<BR>

Did I not tell thee I must not sing on Miroch in our course?&#8221;<BR>

Marko started from slumber, and sprang from the dappled horse.<BR>

Well did he stretch the girth-straps for Dapple the good gray;<BR>

He kissed him, and embraced him, and to the steed did he say:<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 122------------------------>

<A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;&#8220;Ah, Dapple the steed, of all my strength the great right wing art thou;<BR>

Rav&iacute;yoyla, the vila, do thou overtake her now.<BR>

I will shoe thee with pure silver and gold of the seventh proof;<BR>

I will cover thee with silk to the knee, with tassels thence to the hoof;<BR>

And all thy mane, moreover, shall be mingled with the gold;<BR>

And I will deck thy trappings with small pearls manifold.<BR>

If thou dost not overtake her, I will put out both thine eyes;<BR>

I will break thy legs, all four of them, and leave thee in evil guise;<BR>

And thou shalt struggle from fir to fir, abandoned and forlorn,<BR>

Even as I, Prince Marko, without my brother sworn.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Prince Marko on gray Dapple&#8217;s back forthwith himself he threw;<BR>

They raced across Mount Miroch. O&#8217;er the trees the vila flew,<BR>

And desperately Dapple galloped the midst of the forest through.<BR>

At first nowhere could the vila be seen or heard thereby;<BR>

But at last, when Dapple saw her, he leaped three spear-lengths high<BR>

And a full four spear-lengths forward. Dapple gained on her swift;<BR>

<P>

In her distress she leaped aloft amid the clouds and lift.<BR>

Up Marko hurled the golden mace, the weapon of great worth,<BR>

And smote her between the shoulders, and beat her to the earth.<BR>

Left and right he did her smite with the golden club that day.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Why shottest thou my brother, vila? May the good God thee slay!<BR>

Give thou herbs for the hero. Ere long thou shalt lose thine head.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The vila besought him in God&#8217;s name. Imploringly she said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Prince Marko, my sworn brother, God and St. John before,<BR>

Release me alive in the forest, to search Mount Miroch o&#8217;er<BR>

For herbs to heal the hero, and his fierce wounds abate.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko harkened her prayer, for his heart was compassionate;<BR>

Alive into the forest he let the vila go.<BR>

She gathered herbs on Miroch, as she wandered to and fro,<BR>

And she called often: &#8220;My brother, I am coming from the field.&#8221;<BR>

The vila gathered many an herb, and the hero&#8217;s wounds she healed;<BR>

And the lordly throat of Milosh was better than before,<BR>

<P>

And the strong heart of the hero was stronger than of yore.<BR>

The vila went unto Miroch. With his sworn brother good,<BR>

Went Marko to Porech country, and forded Timok flood,<BR>

Till he came to the great town Br&eacute;govo and the Vidin country-side.<BR>

But Rav&iacute;yoyla, the vila, to the other vilas cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Hear ye, my friends, the vilas, and harken, and give ear:<BR>

Shoot no hero on the mountain when Marko the Prince is near,<BR>

Or while Dapple and he and the war-club with six gold knobs are here.<BR>

What I have suffered at his hands, I have not strength to say,<BR>

And hardly out of them at last alive I got away.&#8221;<BR>
