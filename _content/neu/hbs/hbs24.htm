<H2 ALIGN="center">THE MARRIAGE OF PRINCE MARKO</H2>

P<SMALL>RINCE</SMALL> M<SMALL>ARKO</SMALL> with his mother one evening sate alone.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Said his mother:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Marko, my little son, old is thy mother grown;</TD></TR></TABLE>

No more can she prepare for thee the meal whereon to dine;<BR>

She cannot light a torch for thee or serve the ruddy wine.<BR>

Marry, my son, a woman forthwith to take my place.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko unto his mother shortly he spake apace:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;In God&#8217;s name, my ancient mother, I have been nine realms around,<BR>

And a tenth, the Turkish empire. When a girl to my taste I found,<BR>

She would not have been to thy liking; when I found a friend for thee,<BR>

Then she was not to my liking, nor desirable to me.<BR>

Except for one, my mother, in the Bulgarian land;<BR>

I saw her in Sh&iacute;shmanin&#8217;s palace; by a cistern did she stand.<BR>

When I looked on her, my mother, the grass swam under me;<BR>

There is the maid for me, mother, and a dear friend for thee.<BR>

Get me food for the journey; I will ask for the maiden&#8217;s hand.&#8221;<BR>

<P>

&#8195;She waited not, nor abided till the dawn shone in the land,<BR>

But she baked him bread with sugar. When the dawn broke clear and fine,<BR>

Marko girded himself and the steed and filled a skin of wine;<BR>

He hung it on Dapple&#8217;s saddle, and his mace on the other hand;<BR>

On Dapple he went to Sh&iacute;shmanin&#8217;s house in the Bulgarian land.<BR>

Afar the king perceived him. Marko he came before;<BR>

They embraced and kissed each other, and asked how they them bore.<BR>

The servant to the cellars went with the faithful steed,<BR>

But the king, the good Prince Marko to his white house did lead.<BR>

They sat down at the ready board the dark-red wine to drain;<BR>

When they had drunk their fill thereof Marko leaped up again.<BR>

He doffed his cap, he bowed to the earth, and he asked for the maid of the king.<BR>

The king said naught, but gave her; on the ground he laid a ring,<BR>

And an apple thereby; moreover for the girl he let cut a shift.<BR>

To her sisters and kinswomen Marko gave many a gift,<BR>

He gave three packs of treasure; and there a month he spent,<BR>

Ere to gather gay-clad wooers to Prilip the white he went.<BR>

&#8195;The maid&#8217;s mother bespoke him: &#8220;My son-in-law,&#8221; she cried,<BR>

&#8220;My Marko, let no stranger be the bringer of the bride,<BR>

But rather thine own brother or some nephew of thy name,<BR>

For the maid is passing lovely and we fear some open shame.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;There bode Prince Marko of Prilip the remnant of the night;<BR>

At dawn he saddled Dapple and rode to Prilip the white.<BR>

Near the town his mother saw him, and drew near a little space,<BR>

And in her arms she took him and kissed him on the face.<BR>

And his mother asked Prince Marko, as he kissed her milk-white hand:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My son, Prince Marko, art thou come in peace across the land?<BR>

And hast thou as yet discovered a daughter dear for me,<BR>

A maid to be my daughter and a true wife to thee?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Marko answered:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My mother, I am come in peace through the land;</TD></TR></TABLE>

I have asked and won in marriage a maiden to my hand.<BR>

<P>

When I set out for my white house, then the maid&#8217;s mother cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;My Marko, let no stranger be the bringer of the bride,<BR>

But rather thine own brother or some nephew of thy name,<BR>

For the maid is passing lovely and we fear some open shame.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;But, mother, I have not a brother, no nephew at all have I.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;His mother spake:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Son Marko, be troubled not thereby.</TD></TR></TABLE>

A letter in fine characters, my son, thou shalt indite<BR>

Unto the Doge of Venice, and bid him come forthright<BR>

To be groomsman at thy wedding, with five hundred wooers beside.<BR>

Thou shalt write to Stevan Zemlyich to be bringer of the bride,<BR>

With five hundred wooers likewise. No shame at all shalt thou fear.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When Marko understood her speech, he harkened his mother dear.<BR>

He wrote the letters on his knee, and one to the doge is borne,<BR>

And one to Stevan Zemlyich, that is his brother sworn.<BR>

Time passed; the Doge of Venice came, and five hundred wooers beside;<BR>

<P>

He went to the slender tower, but they to the lealand wide.<BR>

In a little while came Stevan and five hundred wooers fine.<BR>

They gathered at the slender tower and drank their fill of the wine.<BR>

Then they went to the court of Sh&iacute;shmanin in the Bulgarian land,<BR>

And King Sh&iacute;shmanin received them, and open was his hand<BR>

To the heroes in the houses and the horses in the stall,<BR>

And three white days he kept them, and they rested one and all.<BR>

When out broke the fourth morning, spake the heralds in this wise:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;What ho, ye gay-clad wooers, it is time that ye arise!<BR>

Short are the days, and the delays at nightfall long are they;<BR>

Ye should take thought, ye wooers, to wend the homeward way.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;King Sh&iacute;shmanin brought gracious gifts. Fair hose he gave to one,<BR>

To another he gave a gallant cloth with embroidery thereon;<BR>

He gave unto the groomsman a table of gold well-tried,<BR>

And he gave a golden garment to the bringer of the bride,<BR>

And a great war-steed furthermore, and charged him with the maid;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 138------------------------>

</P>

And to the bringer of the bride the king moreover said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Here is the steed and the maid likewise to take to Marko&#8217;s place:<BR>

Give him the maid; the steed is thine, a gift of honor and grace.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Forth marched the gay-clad wooers through the Bulgarian land.<BR>

Where comes good fortune, also ill fortune is at hand;<BR>

For on that tide both far and wide the wind blew in the field,<BR>

The wind stirred lightly the maiden&#8217;s veil and the maiden&#8217;s face was revealed.<BR>

The Doge of Venice saw her. His head for grief ached sore.<BR>

He scarce could wait till evening the land had fallen o&#8217;er.<BR>

When they came to the night encampment, the Doge of Venice sped<BR>

To the tent of Stevan Zemlyich, and soft to him he said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O Stevan, the bringer of the bride, give me thy sister dear<BR>

One night for my love, and thou shalt have this bootful of treasure here.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Lo, Stevan, the yellow ducats!&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>But Stevan to him did cry:</TD></TR></TABLE>

&#8220;Be silent, doge, mayst thou change to stone! Has it entered thy mind to die?&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 139------------------------>

<A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;The Doge of Venice turned him back. At the second camp he went<BR>

And spoke to Stevan Zemlyich in the midst of the white tent:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;I prithee, Stevan Zemlyich, give me thy sister dear<BR>

One night for my love. Thou shalt have therefor two bootsfull of treasure here.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Lo, Stevan, the yellow ducats!&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>Said Stevan thereupon:</TD></TR></TABLE>

&#8220;Go, doge! Mayst thou perish straightway! Shall my sister be undone?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;To his tent went the doge. When the third camp was pitched at eventide,<BR>

The doge went unto Stevan, the bringer of the bride:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O thou, the bringer of the bride, give me thy sister dear<BR>

One night for my love. Thou shalt have therefor three bootsfull of ducats here.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Thereupon Stevan Zemlyich was finally cajoled<BR>

To give the doge his sister for three bootsfull of yellow gold.<BR>

Stevan took up the ducats and the doge led the maid<BR>

By the white hand within his tent and softly to her said:<BR>

&#8220;Sit down, sweet bride, that thou and I may fondle each other now.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But answered the Bulgarian bride:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 140------------------------>

<A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A>

</TD></TR><TR><TD><TD>&#8220;A shameful groomsman art thou!</TD></TR></TABLE>

O Doge of Venice, beneath us the earth will open wide,<BR>

The heaven will crack above us! What man shall fondle a bride?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The Doge of Venice answered:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Speak not like a fool confessed!</TD></TR></TABLE>

I have already, dearest, nine christened brides caressed,<BR>

And of wives four and twenty. The earth it gaped not wide,<BR>

Nor did the heaven crack o&#8217;er us. Sit down, let me fondle thee, bride!&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But the bride said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Doge of Venice, my groomsman, harken this.</TD></TR></TABLE>

My mother dear adjured me no bearded man to kiss,<BR>

But a young and beardless hero, such as Prince Marko is.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the Doge of Venice heard it, he called swift barbers there;<BR>

One bathed him, and the second he shaved him clean and fair.<BR>

And the lovely bride bowed over in the place where she stood,<BR>

And picked up the beard and wrapped it in a piece of linen good.<BR>

Thereafter the Doge of Venice the barbers drove outside,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 141------------------------>

<A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A>

</P>

And said unto her softly: &#8220;Now sit thee down, sweet bride!&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Then answered the Bulgarian girl:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;When Marko of this shall hear,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Three heads, O Doge, my groomsman, from our bodies he will shear.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The doge said unto the sweet bride:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Speak not so foolishly!</TD></TR></TABLE>

There in the midst of the wooers is Marko plain to see,<BR>

Where his fair white pavilion he did himself unfold.<BR>

Upon the summit of the tent is an apple of red gold,<BR>

With gems so bright that by their light are half the wooers seen clear.<BR>

But at my side sit down, O bride, that we may fondle here.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The bride said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Wait in the tent a space, thou dearest groomsman of mine,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Till I look on the sky above the clouds, if it be foul or fine.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When she had came without the tent, she fled to Marko in fear;<BR>

The girl sprang through the wooers like a fawn of a single year,<BR>

To the tent of the Prince Marko, that down to sleep had lain;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 142------------------------>

<A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A>

</P>

And the girl stood before him, and her tears ran down like rain.<BR>

Then Marko leaped to his feet and spake to the Bulgarian bride:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;What a wretch, Bulgarian, art thou! Couldst thou not e&#8217;en abide<BR>

Till we came to my white dwelling, and in Christian guise were wed?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;He seized the saber silver-wrought, but the bride bowed down and said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Marko, mine is no wretch&#8217;s line, but a house of power and pride!<BR>

The wretches are thine, thy groomsman and the bringer of the bride!<BR>

Thine own bride Stevan Zemlyich to the Doge of Venice sold<BR>

For three bootsfull of treasure, ducats of yellow gold.<BR>

Prince Marko haply will not believe&#8212;if thou believest not me,<BR>

The beard of the Doge of Venice, I have brought it unto thee.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And thereupon she opened the cloth that held it wide.<BR>

When the Prince Marko saw it, he spoke unto the bride:<BR>

&#8220;Sit down, fair bride; on the morrow I will look the matter o&#8217;er.&#8221;<BR>

Then Marko laid him down again to slumber there once more.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 143------------------------>

<A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A>

</P>

But when on the morrow morning the mighty sun outbroke,<BR>

Marko leaped nimbly to his feet, and fastened back his cloak;<BR>

In his hand he took the heavy mace, and then away he hied,<BR>

To bid the groomsman good morrow, and the bringer of the bride.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Good morrow, bringer of the bride, and groomsman mine,&#8221; said he;<BR>

&#8220;Bringer of the bride and groomsman, say, where now the bride may be.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Still was the bringer of the bride, no answer would he make;<BR>

But unto the Prince Marko the Doge of Venice spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;How now, friend Marko the bridegroom, of such strange whims men are,<BR>

That hardly a man may make a jest without begetting a war!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Evil is the jest of thine, O doge!&#8221; thereto did Marko say,<BR>

&#8220;No jest is a shaven beard! Where now is thy beard of yesterday?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Yet more to him in answer had the Doge of Venice said;<BR>

Marko swung the great saber, and cut off the doge&#8217;s head.<BR>

Forthwith fled Stevan Zemlyich, but Marko ran amain,<BR>

And smote him with the saber, and cut him right in twain.<BR>

<P>

In the tent himself he girded, and saddled Dapple aright;<BR>

Forth went the gay-clad wooers, and came to Prilip the white.<BR>
