<H2 ALIGN="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE EAGLE</H2>

M<SMALL>ARKO</SMALL> lay on the tsar&#8217;s highway, and green was all his gear.<BR>

A silver cloth was on his face; by his head was planted his spear.<BR>

By the spear stood Dapple, but on it a great white eagle stayed;<BR>

It spread its wings above the prince and gave the hero shade,<BR>

And water in its beak it bore, the wounded hero, to slake.<BR>

But a vila of the mountain unto the eagle spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;In the name of God, white eagle, how hath Marko stood thine aid,<BR>

That thou spreadest thy wings above him to give the hero shade,<BR>

And bringest water in thy beak, the wounded hero to slake?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But thereupon the eagle unto the vila spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Be silent, vila, and hold thy tongue. What, good hath come to me,<BR>

Hath aye come at Prince Marko&#8217;s hands. Keepest thou the memory<BR>

Of the day the army perished on the field of K&oacute;sovo,<BR>

And both tsars, Lazar and Murad, died in the overthrow?<BR>

Up to the stirrups of the steed that day the red blood ran,<BR>

Unto the silken girdle of many a fighting man;<BR>

Horses and heroes swam, steed by steed, and hero hero by,<BR>

And we flew up hungry and thirsty, the vultures of the sky;<BR>

We fed on human flesh, we drank our fill of human blood:<BR>

My wings were wet. Forth flamed the sun in heaven where he stood:<BR>

My wings grew stiff; my feathers in flight I could not wield;<BR>

My comrades flew, and I was left upon the level field.<BR>

Heroes and steeds rushed onward, and me they trampled o&#8217;er.<BR>

God sent Marko; he lifted me up from the heroes&#8217; gore<BR>

And put me behind on Dapple. To the green wood amain<BR>

He bore me and tossed me into a fir; and down the gentle rain<BR>

Descended there upon me. My wings were washen clean,<BR>

That I might fly thereafter over the forest green;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And there I met my comrades.&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;One more good deed to me</TD></TR></TABLE>

Did the good Marko Kr&aacute;lyevich. Hast thou in memory<BR>

How the town burned at K&oacute;sovo? Burnt was Aj&aacute;ga&#8217;s tower:<BR>

Therein my little eaglets were hidden in that hour,<BR>

And Marko gathered all of them in his silken bosom fold,<BR>

And a full month he nourished them in the white house of his hold,<BR>

And let them go to the green wood, when a month and a week were told.<BR>

And this did Marko for me, that I met my eaglets dear.&#8221;<BR>

&nbsp;<BR>

&#8195;Prince Marko is remembered like a fair day in the year.<BR>
