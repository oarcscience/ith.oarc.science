<H2 ALIGN="center">THE MARRIAGE OF STOYAN Y&Aacute;NKOVICH</H2>

W<SMALL>HILE</SMALL> still men dreamed not of the dawn, the gates were opened wide<BR>

In &Uacute;dbina, and from the town a squadron forth did ride.<BR>

Four and thirty friends are there; before them is Mustay Bey,<BR>

The lord of Lika;<A NAME="page_202_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_202_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> to Kunor wood he went to hunt that day.<BR>

For half a week he hunted, but nothing came to hand;<BR>

To &Uacute;dbina and Lika he went homeward through the land;<BR>

When down through the fir forest to a spring be turned aside,<BR>

To drink and rest. He cast his eye &#8217;neath a green fir that tide;<BR>

But when Mustay Bey of Lika came, the twigs of the fir tree shone.<BR>

A drunken warrior lay asleep in the fir wood alone;<BR>

All in the pure gold was he clad and in the silver fine;<BR>

On his head he wore a splendid cap with silver feathers nine,<BR>

And set beside the feathers a great wing silver-wrought;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 203------------------------>

<A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A>

</P>

For a thousand ducats and no less the silver wing was bought.<BR>

On his shoulders the hero weareth a mantle great and green,<BR>

And thirty knobs of yellow gold thereon are to be seen,<BR>

Each one of a golden measure; and one &#8217;neath the neck is worn,<BR>

Three measure weight with a screw that opes, and brandy that holds in the morn.<BR>

On the mantle are three golden plates, of the weight of four good pound;<BR>

Two were of twisted goldwork, and one did the smelters found.<BR>

His breeches had golden buckles; and yellow, rich to see,<BR>

Were his legs as any falcon&#8217;s from the ankle to the knee.<BR>

From the buckles hung fine golden chains, and from them trinkets fair,<BR>

Such as the slender maidens aye at their sweet throats wear.<BR>

At his splendid belt were pistols of the Damascus gold,<BR>

Silver-inlaid was the great blade, with three gold hilts to hold;<BR>

In them are set three precious stones; it is worth three towns of the tsar.<BR>

On his breast was a musket, and golden the thirty hoops of it are,<BR>

And each hoop worth ten ducats, and thirty, one by the sight;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 204------------------------>

There was more of gold on the musket than of steel hammered and bright.<BR>

&#8195;When the hero rose upward from the grass, the fir twigs crackled then,<BR>

But the Bey of Lika pinned him down with his four and thirty men.<BR>

When the hero looked up from the grass with a black and lowering eye,<BR>

He saw that the Turks had pinned him down, and his weapons were not by.<BR>

One of his foes with his great arms he gripped as with a girth;<BR>

The living heart was burst in the Turk as he hurled him to the earth;<BR>

And seven others, moreover, he slaughtered of the band,<BR>

Before the Turks could master the strength of the white hand.<BR>

But they captured him, and forthwith the white hand did they bind,<BR>

And drove him to white &Uacute;dbina with his weapons tied behind,<BR>

That great and small might marvel how Mustay, of Lika the Bey,<BR>

Such a warrior with his weapons had taken in the fray.<BR>

And Mustay spake to him as through the open field they came:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;God&#8217;s love! Whence comest thou, lord unknown? What do men call thy name?<BR>

Whither wast thou going, and whither have thy comrades gone away?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Saith he:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;What sayst thou, Mustay, of Lika that art Bey?</TD></TR></TABLE>

Hast thou heard of the Latin seacoast, and Kot&aacute;ri<A NAME="page_205_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_205_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> set thereon,<BR>

And of Stoyan, the son of Yanko? I am Stoyan, Yanko&#8217;s son,<BR>

And I had no other comrade than God and myself alone;<BR>

And I had taken counsel to descend beneath thy tower,<BR>

And the slender maiden, Ha&#253;kuna, to lure her in that hour,<BR>

And take her to Kot&aacute;ri&#8212;but it was not God&#8217;s decree;<BR>

The thrice accurs&egrave;d liquor it overmastered me!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Said Mustay, the Bey of Lika: &#8220;Stoyan, well mayst thou speed!<BR>

Thou hast fallen into a hero&#8217;s hands who will find thee a wife indeed!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Amid their speech to &Uacute;dbina at last they made their way,<BR>

Beneath the tower of Mustay, of Lika that was Bey;<BR>

And great and small came out to gaze on the squadron in that hour,<BR>

And Ha&#253;kuna, Mustay&#8217;s sister dear, looked down from the slender tower.<BR>

At the tambour frame of coral a needle of glass doth she hold,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 206------------------------>

<A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A>

</P>

And she weaveth through the linen white a gallant thread of gold.<BR>

And when she saw the squadron forth from the forest come,<BR>

That led a fettered hero with his shining weapons home,<BR>

The tambour frame before her with her hand she thrust away&#8212;<BR>

Two of its legs were shattered&#8212;and to herself did she say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Dear God, a mighty marvel, a hero in evil stead!<BR>

By what guile did they bind him, for he is not wounded nor dead?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But when she reckoned the squadron, were lacking seven men.<BR>

When the squadron came &#8217;neath the white tower, she took his weapons then,<BR>

And bore away his weapons in the treasury to keep.<BR>

Stoyan they cast in a prison that was fifty fathom deep;<BR>

Therein to the knees of the hero the water doth arise,<BR>

And the bones of captive Christians to his shoulder reach likewise.<BR>

The bey went unto the new inn, with his men the wine to drain,<BR>

And to boast to the Turks of &Uacute;dbina what a captive he had ta&#8217;en.<BR>

The fair maid went to the dungeon door with a bucket of wine that tide;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 207------------------------>

<A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A>

</P>

She lowered it with a strong cord, and unto the hero cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O hero, God protect thee, nor slay thee here in shame!<BR>

Whence art thou? what is thy country? what dost thou call thy name?<BR>

How did the Turks deceive thee, when thine arms behind they tied?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Stoyan drank of the yellow wine, and to the damsel cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Who calls from the white dungeon? My throat hath drunken full.<BR>

With the windlass half way up the hold the hero shalt thou pull;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>From thence will I tell the story.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>The maiden harkened thereto;</TD></TR></TABLE>

The rope with hooks of steel let down, and half way up she drew.<BR>

Stoyan the son of Yanko. He questioned her and said:<BR>

&#8220;Who calls from the white dungeon?&#8221; Then appeared the Turkish maid:<BR>

&#8220;Even I, unknown hero, the sister of Mustay Bey.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Stoyan answered:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;O Ha&#253;kuna, may God in heaven thee slay!</TD></TR></TABLE>

I am Stoyan the son of Yanko, and in prison because of thee.<BR>

The Turks beguiled me when I was drunk, and bound have they taken me.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The Turkish maid spake to him:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 208------------------------>

<A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A>

</TD></TR><TR><TD><TD>&#8220;O Stoyan, of Yanko born,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Fain would the Turks destroy thee. They will question thee tomorn<BR>

Whether to be a Moslem thy faith thou wilt put aside.<BR>

Become a Moslem, Stoyan; and I will be thy bride.<BR>

My brother, the Bey of Lika, two treasure towers hath he,<BR>

One his, one mine; if he dieth first, mine and thine shall they be.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Spake Stoyan:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Thou: damsel, Ha&#253;kuna, no more like a mad girl rave!</TD></TR></TABLE>

Though &Uacute;dbina and Lika into my hand they gave,<BR>

By God I would not turn Moslem! In Kot&aacute;ri my treasure lay,<BR>

More than the Turks&#8217;, and a hero better am I than they.<BR>

If God it grant, fair damsel, before the noon hour ring,<BR>

The captains of Kot&aacute;ri over &Uacute;dbina shall spring,<BR>

Over and roundabout it, and hence shall they rescue me.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said the maid:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Speak not like a madman; ere that they will slaughter thee.</TD></TR></TABLE>

But to take me to be thy wedded wife, firm will thy faith remain,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>If I free thee out of the dungeon?&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 209------------------------>

<A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A>

</TD></TR><TR><TD><TD>And Stoyan answered again:</TD></TR></TABLE>

&#8195;&#8220;Firm is my faith, fair damsel, I will take thee before all;<BR>

Verily on mine honor I will not deceive thee at all.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the damsel heard, in the prison she lowered him in that hour,<BR>

And she wended her own way forthwith unto the slender tower.<BR>

A little time went after this; from the inn came forth the bey,<BR>

And the maiden staggered before him, as a fit were on her that day.<BR>

Mustay the Bey asked of her: &#8220;What aileth thee, sister dear?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>She said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;A pain of the head and the heart is fallen upon me here;</TD></TR></TABLE>

A chill is come upon me; &#8217;twere better, brother, to die.<BR>

But seat thee on the soft cushions, that I on thy breast may lie,<BR>

And there at last surrender my spirit in its sin.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Mustay the Bey was sorry, for he had no other kin,<BR>

And over his white features the bitter tears he shed.<BR>

He sat upon the cushions, on his bosom she drooped her head;<BR>

One hand she laid on his bosom, with the other did she seize<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 210------------------------>

<A NAME="page_210"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 210</FONT></A>

</P>

In her dear brother&#8217;s pocket the stable and prison keys,<BR>

And the key of the treasure likewise. Then tossed she where she lay<BR>

On the cushion, and to his sister made question Mustay the Bey:<BR>

&#8220;Has not God granted thee, sister, that the pain should pass away?&#8221;<BR>

&#8220;Brother, he has, may God be thanked!&#8221; And he went to the roof outside,<BR>

To counsel with them of &Uacute;dbina how Stoyan should die that tide.<BR>

&#8195;But the maiden leaped to her feet, and wide the treasury door she threw;<BR>

And saddlebags of ducats and Stoyan&#8217;s armor, too,<BR>

She gathered in that hour from the dungeon white and cold.<BR>

She let out Stoyan, and led him from the cellars of the hold;<BR>

And released the steeds from the stables: the good white steed of the bey,<BR>

That ever more he rode upon in the heroic fray,<BR>

And the black steed of his lady; swifter is none in the land.<BR>

The damsel mounted the white, but the black is under Stoyan&#8217;s hand,<BR>

And forthwith over the broad field swiftly they got them gone<BR>

Over Og&oacute;ryelitsa, and from Kunor the wood, and on<BR>

From Kunor to K&oacute;tari. Then the son of Yanko said:<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 211------------------------>

<A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;&#8220;Grievously am I weary, O Ha&#253;kuna the maid!<BR>

Dismount from the white charger; of sleep I have sore need.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But she said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;By thy courage, Stoyan! Drive forward the black steed</TD></TR></TABLE>

On unto flat Kot&aacute;ri; sleep cometh with little aid.<BR>

But for some squadron of the Turks yet am I sore afraid!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But he harkened not. From the horses they descended on the grass;<BR>

With his head on her bosom Stoyan slept; like a foolish lamb he was.<BR>

But the maiden cannot slumber. Before the white day&#8217;s hour<BR>

The bey&#8217;s wife rose to visit the girl in the slender tower.<BR>

Very sick was the damsel, when darkness fell yestreen,<BR>

But now in the slender tower no more the girl is seen;<BR>

And the money from the treasury is gathered up and gone,<BR>

And no longer in the dungeon lieth Stoyan, Yanko&#8217;s son.<BR>

Forthwith came back the woman into the slender tower;<BR>

She fired the great alarum gun suddenly in that hour.<BR>

On the green roof the bey heard it; what was come to pass he knew,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 212------------------------>

<A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A>

</P>

And swiftly with his fingers he searched his pockets through,<BR>

And found that from his pockets the keys were stolen away.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My brothers, men of &Uacute;dbina!&#8221; then shouted Mustay Bey,<BR>

&#8220;Stoyan, the son of Yanko, with the maid is fled abroad.<BR>

Up on your feet, my brethren, as ye believe in God!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Strange is the Turkish use. Their steeds were ready saddled there;<BR>

They seized their steeds and over the wide field did they fare.<BR>

They reached the Kunor wood, and through the forest did they pass<BR>

Unto Kot&aacute;ri. Ha&#253;kuna looked up from the green grass;<BR>

Often she looked to Kunor. A crest rose far away,<BR>

The dust of horses and heroes, and she knew her brother, the bey,<BR>

And the thirty men of &Uacute;dbina. Stoyan she dares not wake,<BR>

But above the face of Stoyan she weepeth for his sake.<BR>

When Stoyan started from slumber, he bespake her in this wise:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;What ails thee, Turkish damsel, that the tears run from thine eyes?<BR>

Dost thou weep for thy brother, Mustay Bey, and his great treasury?<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 213------------------------>

<A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A>

</P>

Or haply is it that Stoyan no longer pleases thee?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Quoth the maiden:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Sorrow-stricken may thy mother be this tide!</TD></TR></TABLE>

I weep not for my brother nor the treasure of his pride.<BR>

We have brought the treasure with us, in the midst of my heart art thou;<BR>

But the bey with the thirty of &Uacute;dbina is hard upon us now.<BR>

Ride the black to Kot&aacute;ri; our lives are thrown away!&#8221;<BR>

When Stoyan heard the damsel, unto her did he say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;By God, I will not, maiden! They have stirred my anger up;<BR>

They pinned me down on the grass when I had drunken of the cup.<BR>

Now will I make exchange of gifts with thy brother, dear indeed!<BR>

Do thou ride the black charger, and give me the white steed;<BR>

The white is a little better, when I go thy brother to meet.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Stoyan leapt on the good white steed; the black she mounted fleet,<BR>

And galloped to white Kot&aacute;ri; but Stoyan against the bey.<BR>

And it were worth the trouble, to sit and watch the fray,<BR>

And behold a mighty marvel, how thirty smote at one:<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 214------------------------>

<A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A>

</P>

The palace that sent thirty forth waits the return of none.<BR>

Stoyan smote off the thirty heads, and he seized on Mustay Bey;<BR>

Hands bound behind, he drove him to where the damsel lay.<BR>

He spake to the damsel as he drew the silver-hilted blade:<BR>

&#8220;Thus, Ha&#253;kuna, &#8217;twixt brothers exchange of gifts is made!&#8221;<BR>

He swung the silver-hilted sword, but she threw her arms on high:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;By thy courage, leave a sister a brother for swearing by!<BR>

For thee also a sister might weep, and be full of woe.<BR>

Turn him now back to &Uacute;dbina, and give him leave to go.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Stoyan turned back the saber; tighter he bound the bey,<BR>

And set his face toward &Uacute;dbina, and unto him did say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;When thou comest unto &Uacute;dbina, to drink with the men thereby,<BR>

Tell thou the whole truth to them, nor ever speak a lie;<BR>

And here will I grant thy life to thee in the fierce single fray.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Forth in his bonds to &Uacute;dbina alone went back the bey;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 215------------------------>

<A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A>

</P>

But to flat Kot&aacute;ri Stoyan the Turkish damsel takes,<BR>

And his christened wife he kisses whensoever he awakes.<BR>
