<H2 ALIGN="center">THE DEATH OF MARKO KR&Aacute;LYEVICH</H2>

P<SMALL>RINCE</SMALL> M<SMALL>ARKO</SMALL> rose up early on Sunday before the sun,<BR>

On Mount &Uacute;rvina by the seacoast. And as he rode thereon,<BR>

Dapple the stallion staggered sore; from his eyes ran bitter tears.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Marko it grieved. He spake to the steed:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;A hundred and sixty years,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Dapple, my gallant stallion, are gone since I came on thee.<BR>

Never hast thou staggered; yet to-day hast thou staggered under me,<BR>

And thou sheddest tears. God knoweth there is no good from the sign:<BR>

The one of us is in danger; thy life it is or mine.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;While Marko spake, a vila on &Uacute;rvina&#8217;s steep side<BR>

In summons to Prince Marko lifted her voice and cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Knowest thou, Marko, my brother sworn, why stumbles Dapple, thine horse?<BR>

He sorrows for thee, his master, since soon will ye part perforce.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said Marko to the vila:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;May thy throat ache for this!</TD></TR></TABLE>

How should I part with Dapple? Cities and emperies<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 179------------------------>

<A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A>

</P>

Have I not passed over and traversed, from the east unto the west?<BR>

And Dapple, my steed, was ever of all good steeds the best;<BR>

And I was the best of the heroes. He shall not from me be led,<BR>

While upon Marko&#8217;s shoulders remaineth Marko&#8217;s head.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said the vila:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Marko, my brother sworn, none shall take Dapple so.</TD></TR></TABLE>

Neither shalt thou die at a hero&#8217;s hands by any saber blow,<BR>

Nor by the shock of the heavy mace, nor piercing of the spear;<BR>

For any hero of the earth, Prince Marko, have no fear.<BR>

But Marko, God shall slay thee, the ancient slayer of men.<BR>

If thou wilt not believe me, go up to the mountain then.<BR>

Aloft shalt thou see two slender firs on the left and on the right;<BR>

They have overhung the mountain with the summits of their might.<BR>

And all the air is spicy with their fair needles green;<BR>

And there runneth a spring of water the slender trees between.<BR>

There turn and dismount from Dapple; to a tree the steed shalt thou tie.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 180------------------------>

Raise thyself over the water-spring that bubbles up hard by,<BR>

And look at thy face in the water. Thou shalt see when thou shalt die.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko obeyed. Aloft he looked on the left and on the right<BR>

At the firs that overhung the mount with the summits of their might,<BR>

And all the air was spicy with the fair needles green.<BR>

There Marko halted Dapple in a little space between,<BR>

And to a fir tree in the midst the charger did he tie.<BR>

He raised himself o&#8217;er the water-spring that bubbled up hard by;<BR>

And when Marko looked on the water, he saw when he should die.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>He wept apace and spake apace:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Ah, lying world, fair flower&#8212;</TD></TR></TABLE>

Fair wast thou and too little have I roamed thee in my hour,<BR>

Three hundred years; and now must part from thy pleasure and thy power!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;From his girdle the Prince Marko drew out the iron glaive,<BR>

And he went to the steed Dapple, and Dapple&#8217;s neck he clave,<BR>

That Dapple might come never to a Turk, a prize of war,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 181------------------------>

<A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A>

</P>

And do him bitter service bearing water in the jar.<BR>

When he had slaughtered Dapple, he buried Dapple the steed;<BR>

A better grave the horse he gave than to Andrew, his brother, indeed.<BR>

The mighty glaive, thereafter, he broke in pieces four,<BR>

Lest it should come into Turkish hands, and the Turks should be glad therefor,<BR>

And rejoice for the sword of Marko to their hand that had fallen then;<BR>

And lest, moreover, he should be curst by any Christian men.<BR>

When he had broken the saber, in seven the spear broke he,<BR>

And threw it among the fir twigs. The rough mace mightily<BR>

He grasped, and from &Uacute;rvina hurled it into the thick blue sea;<BR>

And Marko said: &#8220;When that club of mine ariseth out of the main,<BR>

Then will there be a hero upon the earth again.&#8221;<BR>

When he had ruined his weapons, then pen and ink he drew<BR>

From his belt, and from his pocket white paper fresh and new.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And he writes a letter:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Whoever over &Ugrave;rvina shall fare</TD></TR></TABLE>

To the cold spring between the firs, and finds brave Marko there,<BR>

<P>

Let him know forthwith that perished at last is Marko the bold.<BR>

About him are three money-belts. What treasure do they hold?<BR>

Therein is a lordly treasure of ducats of yellow gold.<BR>

One belt will I give with my blessing to him who buries me;<BR>

With the second belt let churches be sculptured splendidly;<BR>

And the third belt I bequeath it to the maimed and to the blind,<BR>

That they may sing of Marko and his fame be kept in mind.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the letter was written, he thrust it upon a twig of the fir,<BR>

Whence from the road it might be seen by any wayfarer.<BR>

The golden writing-set therewith into the spring he threw,<BR>

And his good mantle of the green from off his shoulders drew.<BR>

He spread the mantle beneath the fir, and the sign of the cross made then;<BR>

He pulled the sables over his eyes, and lay there, nor rose again.<BR>

Dead was Marko beside the spring. For a week, from day to day,<BR>

Whoever saw Prince Marko that traveled along that way,<BR>

Deemed that the good Prince Marko asleep was lying there;<BR>

And, fearing to awake him, a long way round would they fare.<BR>

&#8195;Where&#8217;er is found good fortune, misfortune cometh apace,<BR>

And wherever evil hap is found, good cometh soon in the place.<BR>

Abbot Basil of Athos from the church Vil&iacute;ndar the white,<BR>

He it was spied Prince Marko, with Isaias his acolyte.<BR>

He held his hand: &#8220;Lightly, my son, see that thou wake him not.<BR>

After sleep is Marko moody; he may kill us on the spot.&#8221;<BR>

But the monk saw how Marko slept. The letter he espied,<BR>

And he read throughout the letter that told how Marko died.<BR>

The monk dismounted from the steed, and raised up Marko the bold.<BR>

Marko was dead. The bitter tears down Basil&#8217;s cheek they rolled,<BR>

And he sorrowed sore for Marko. The belts of golden pelf<BR>

He ungirded from the hero, and belted on himself.<BR>

On many a grave he pondered, where to bury Marko dead.<BR>

He chose; and got him on the horse, and to the seashore sped.<BR>

In a ship he laid Prince Marko. And to Athos the Holy Height<BR>

<P>

</P>

He bore him, to Vil&iacute;ndar, the stately and the white,<BR>

And there the funeral liturgy over the prince he read<BR>

And likewise sang the requiem before they graved the dead.<BR>

There the old man buried Marko. No mark he placed him o&#8217;er,<BR>

That none might say where the hero lay, and mock at him therefore.<BR>
