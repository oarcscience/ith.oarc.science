<H2 ALIGN="center">SISTER AND BROTHER</H2>

N<SMALL>INE</SMALL> dear sons and a daughter, a mother bore and bred;<BR>

She reared them up till they were grown and the sons were ready to wed,<BR>

And the maiden ripe for marriage. And straightway asked for her<BR>

Three suitors, a ban, and a marshal, and a neighbor villager.<BR>

To the neighbor the mother would give her, but her brethren to the man<BR>

From over sea would give her. They said to her: &#8220;Marry the ban,<BR>

The great lord from beyond the sea. In every month of the year<BR>

We will come, and every week in the month, to see thee, sister dear.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The sister obeyed them, and the ban from over sea she wed.<BR>

But behold a marvel! God&#8217;s pestilence struck her nine brethren dead,<BR>

And the solitary mother was left. So passed three years.<BR>

In her grief little Y&eacute;litsa the sister mourned with tears:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Dear God, a mighty marvel! What great sin have I done<BR>

To my brethren, that of all of them cometh to me not one?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The wives of her lord&#8217;s brethren reviled her sharp enow:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O wife of our lords&#8217; brother, a wanton one art thou,<BR>

Hateful unto thy brethren now hast thou come to be,<BR>

That not one of thy brethren comes here to visit thee.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And little sister Y&eacute;litsa wept much both day and night;<BR>

But the dear God, in mercy, took pity on her plight,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And sent forthwith two angels:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Go down, ye angels of mine,</TD></TR></TABLE>

To the white tomb of Yovan, the youngest of the nine;<BR>

Breathe light upon him with your breath; from the tomb frame him a steed;<BR>

From the earth make cakes for the festival all ready to his need;<BR>

Of his shroud make gifts, and get him in readiness to appear<BR>

Upon his wedding visit at the house of his sister dear.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;To the white tomb of Yovan the angels of God made speed;<BR>

They breathed upon him with their breath; from the tomb they framed him a steed,<BR>

And cakes from the earth for the festival all ready to his need;<BR>

Of his shroud they made gifts, and got him in readiness to appear<BR>

Upon his wedding visit at the house of his sister dear.<BR>

Swiftly went Yovan the feeble. When the house before him lay<BR>

His sister saw, and to meet him came forth a little way;<BR>

And O her tears fell bitter, all for her sorrow&#8217;s sake!<BR>

They spread their arms, and each other kissed, and sister to brother spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Did ye not promise, brother, when ye gave me in marriage here,<BR>

That ye would come to see me every month in the year,<BR>

And every week in every month, to visit your sister dear?<BR>

But ye never came to see me, though three full years have fled.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And little Y&eacute;litsa further unto her brother said:<BR>

&#8220;Why hast thou grown so dark, brother? &#8217;Tis as though beneath the sod<BR>

Thou hadst been.&#8221; Said Yovan the feeble: &#8220;Be still, as thou lovest God.<BR>

A hard constraint is on me. I have wedded eight brothers well,<BR>

And served eight sisters by marriage; and, sister, it befell<BR>

That, when my brothers were married, we made nine houses white.<BR>

Therefore, my little sister, am I grown as black as night.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And little sister Y&eacute;litsa got ready. She fashioned then<BR>

Gifts for her brethren and sisters; silken shirts for the men<BR>

She made, and, for her sisters, fair rings and bracelets fair.<BR>

And ever Yovan her brother besought her strongly there:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Dear little sister Y&eacute;litsa, I prithee go not home,<BR>

Till on their wedding visit thy brethren to thee come.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But Y&eacute;litsa would not turn back; her fair gifts she prepared.<BR>

Thence Yovan started homeward, and his sister with him fared.<BR>

When they were come to their home again, a white church stood thereby.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Said Yovan the feeble:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Sister, I prithee tarry nigh,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Until I go behind the church; for here at the marrying<BR>

Of the fourth of our eight brethren, I lost my golden ring.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Let me go to seek it, sister.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>To his tomb went Yovan straight,</TD></TR></TABLE>

And little sister Y&eacute;litsa for Yovan there did wait.<BR>

She waited and sought him. Nigh the church a fresh grave she espied;<BR>

Suddenly she knew in sorrow that Yovan the weak had died.<BR>

Quickly she went to the white house. When she was come to the hall,<BR>

In the hollow rooms of the white house she heard a cuckoo call.<BR>

Nay, it was not a cuckoo blue, but her mother crying sore.<BR>

Y&eacute;litsa lifted up her voice as she came unto the door:<BR>

&#8220;Open the door, poor mother.&#8221; Said the mother thereunto:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Get hence, thou pestilence of God, nine sons of mine that slew!<BR>

Their ancient mother, also, wilt thou smite stark and dead?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And little sister Y&eacute;litsa lifted her voice and said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Poor mother, open now the door! No pestilence is here;<BR>

It is only little Y&eacute;litsa, and she is thy daughter dear.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;She opened the door. Each other they clasped their arms around,<BR>

Wailing like cuckoos. Mother and child fell dead upon the ground.<BR>
