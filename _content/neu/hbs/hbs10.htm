<H2 ALIGN="center">TSAR LAZAR AND TS&Aacute;RITSA M&Iacute;LITSA</H2>

T<SMALL>SAR</SMALL> L<SMALL>AZAR</SMALL> sat at dinner; and with him at the wine<BR>

Sat M&iacute;litsa, the Ts&aacute;ritsa, beside her lord to dine.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Unto her lord said M&iacute;litsa:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;O Servia&#8217;s king and crown,</TD></TR></TABLE>

To-morrow unto K&oacute;sovo the army goeth down,<BR>

Thy vo&#253;vodas and captains. No man thou leavest at home<BR>

With a letter to go to K&oacute;sovo and hither again to come.<BR>

Thou leadest my nine brethren, Yug Bogdan&#8217;s children nine.&#8212;<BR>

Leave me one brother of them all to cheer this heart of mine.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;To her spake Lazar of the Serbs: &#8220;Which wilt thou have with thee<BR>

In the palace?&#8221; And she made answer: &#8220;Let Boshko stay with me.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Then spake Tsar Lazar:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Lady, to-morrow, when day comes on,</TD></TR></TABLE>

And the white dawn breaketh, and the world is warmed of the great sun,<BR>

And they open the gates of the city, go thou unto the arch,<BR>

Wherethrough unto the muster my hosts begin to march.<BR>

The spears shine over the chargers: before them will Boshko ride,<BR>

<P>

And he carries high the standard with a great cross glorified.<BR>

Bless him! Let give the standard to whomsoever he will;<BR>

But let him back to the palace, abiding with thee still.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Now when the gates were opened, what time the morning shone,<BR>

Then forth unto the gateway Queen M&iacute;litsa came down,<BR>

And stood beneath the portal in the shadow of the arch,<BR>

What time unto the muster the host began to march.<BR>

The spears shone over the chargers: before them Boshko rode<BR>

On a bay steed, and his rich weed with shining goldwork glowed,<BR>

And the standard that he carried swept round him fold on fold;<BR>

Over the steed it bellied; thereon was an apple of gold;<BR>

From the apple rose gilded crosses, and tassels from them did hang,<BR>

And brushed against his shoulders as in the wind they swang.<BR>

Queen M&iacute;litsa sprang forward to the bay stallion&#8217;s head,<BR>

And she clasped arms round her brother, and unto him she said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My brother Boshko, thou art become the tsar his gift to me.<BR>

<P>

</P>

Thou shalt not go to K&oacute;sovo; he gives his blessing to thee;<BR>

Thou shalt give the golden banner to the hero of thy will,<BR>

And be my brother in Kr&uacute;shevats, that I may have thee still.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Boshko answered her straightway:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Get back to thy hall this tide!</TD></TR></TABLE>

I would not turn nor give up the flag with the great cross glorified,<BR>

Though the tsar should give me Kr&uacute;shevats for ever and a day;<BR>

For the remnant of the army concerning me would say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Where is the captain, Boshko&#8212;that same I that dared not go<BR>

To perish for Christ his Cross and Faith on the field of K&oacute;sovo?&#8217;&#8201;&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And forthwith he rode the stallion abroad beneath the arch;<BR>

And lo, Yug Bogdan and seven sons began thereby to march!<BR>

She stopped each of the seven to whom her heart did yearn,<BR>

But none of all the seven aside for her would turn.<BR>

With the tsar&#8217;s chargers Voin, her brother, came that way;<BR>

All covered with a panoply of shining gold were they.<BR>

She seized the dun steed under him, and took him by the head;<BR>

<P>

She took her brother in her arms, and unto him she said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My brother Voin, thou art become the tsar his gift to me;<BR>

Thou shalt not go to K&oacute;sovo; he gives his blessing to thee.<BR>

Thou shalt give the tsar&#8217;s war horses to the hero of thy will,<BR>

And be my brother in Kr&uacute;shevats, that I may have thee still.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Voin answered her straightway:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Get back to thy hall this tide!</TD></TR></TABLE>

I would not turn nor give over the steeds that the tsar shall ride;<BR>

What though in wisdom I foresaw all of my overthrow,<BR>

I would ride to death for the Cross and the Faith on level K&oacute;sovo.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Forthwith right through the gateway he spurred the charger well;<BR>

And when the queen that sight had seen, on the stone in a swoon she fell.<BR>

And when King Lazar saw it, the tears ran down his face;<BR>

And he looked and called Gol&uacute;ban, his henchman, from his place:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Gol&uacute;ban, my good henchman, dismount thee in this hour,<BR>

And bear thy lady in thine arms up to the slender tower.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 64------------------------>

<A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A>

</P>

For this the deed of my command God&#8217;s pardon shalt thou find;<BR>

Thou shalt not go to K&oacute;sovo, but linger here behind.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Weeping, Gol&uacute;ban heard it. He dismounted in that hour;<BR>

He bore his lady in his arms up to the slender tower;<BR>

But his will he could not overcome, nor bear to linger so,<BR>

But steed bestrode, and hard he rode away to K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

&#8195;When rose up the white morning, from K&oacute;sovo there wheeled<BR>

A pair of great black ravens from the broad battlefield;<BR>

They perched on the white palace whence Lazar issued forth;<BR>

The one cawed loud and vainly, the one spake words of worth:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Is this Tsar Lazar&#8217;s palace, where he was wont to dwell?<BR>

Is there no man or woman within the citadel?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;None heard but the Queen M&iacute;litsa; she came before the wall,<BR>

And unto those two ravens her voice aloud did call:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;I conjure you, black ravens, sitting upon the coign,<BR>

From whence come ye this morning? Did ye see the armies join?<BR>

Have the armies smitten together in the field of K&oacute;sovo?<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 65------------------------>

<A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A>

</P>

In God his name I conjure you, who hath the overthrow?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;And the black ravens answered:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;At K&oacute;sovo, O queen,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Two hosts that smote at K&oacute;sovo, we saw them fight yestreen.<BR>

Both tsars are down; and of the Turks a remnant doth remain,<BR>

But all the Serbs are slaughtered, or wounded on the plain.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;They spoke; and lo, Mil&uacute;tin came before the queen to stand!<BR>

Wounded full sore, the henchman bore one hand in the other hand;<BR>

Seventeen wounds were on him; his steed with blood was red.<BR>

And unto him the weeping queen rough words in anger said:<BR>

&#8220;What treachery, Mil&uacute;tin, is this unto the tsar?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But he said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Help me down, lady, from the great steed of war;</TD></TR></TABLE>

Lave me with the cool water, and with the ruddy wine,<BR>

Do thou, O royal lady, anoint these wounds of mine.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Queen M&iacute;litsa she lifted him down from the steed of war;<BR>

She laved him with white water, and red wine from the jar.<BR>

<P>

</P>

And when he was himself again, she questioned him withal:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Ah, what betid at K&oacute;sovo? Did the Tsar Lazar fall?<BR>

My father and my brethren, are they fallen on the plain?<BR>

Lord Milosh, and Vuk Br&aacute;nkovich, and Strahin, are they slain?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The servant spake:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My lady, they are dead at K&oacute;sovo,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Where Lazar the tsar glorious fell in the overthrow.<BR>

The Turk and Servian lances lie shattered everywhere,<BR>

But many more of Christian spears, alas, were broken there,<BR>

Defending good Tsar Lazar in the fury of the fray.<BR>

But Yug Bogdan perished, lady, in the fight of the first day;<BR>

Eight of his sons, those champions, were slaughtered side by side;<BR>

For they would not use treachery, and by each other died.<BR>

Still Boshko&#8217;s banner of the cross hurled back the Turks in droves,<BR>

To and fro over K&oacute;sovo, as a falcon harries doves.<BR>

Where the blood flowed up to the knee died Str&aacute;hinya the ban;<BR>

By S&iacute;tnitsa fell Milosh, where the cool waters ran.<BR>

There perished many Turks amain; and Milosh in his ire<BR>

</P>

Hath slain the Sultan Murad&#8212;God be gracious to his sire!&#8212;<BR>

And a good twelve thousand Turks that tide. And aye the Serbs will know<BR>

His deeds of war while men are left to tell of K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

But ask not of the curs&egrave;d Vuk! May God&#8217;s damnation burst<BR>

Upon his sire and all his tribe, and the whole house accurst!<BR>

&#8217;Twas he betrayed the tsar in war unto the Turkish spear,<BR>

And fled with his twelve thousand men, the traitor cavalier!&#8221;<BR>
