N<SMALL>OT</SMALL> yet the dawn had whitened, nor the day star shown its face;<BR>

Men thought not of day&#8212;forth M&aacute;rgita the maid walked in the place,<BR>

In Sriyem over Sl&aacute;nkamen;<A NAME="page_187_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_187_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> barefoot the damsel sprang<BR>

Over the stone so early. In delicate wise she sang,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>But Rayko in the song she cursed:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Rayko, may God thee slay!</TD></TR></TABLE>

The Turks have plagued us grievously in Sriyem, since the day<BR>

When thou becamest vo&#253;voda. When Mirko ruled the land,<BR>

We heard of no Turk, nor ever saw one before us stand;<BR>

But now they plague us grievously. Their horses&#8217; feet are sore<BR>

For riding night and morning in our country evermore.<BR>

The very fields on their horsehoofs are lifted and stolen away,<BR>

And the air is full of javelins and their throwing-darts to-day.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;So sang the girl of Sriyem, and deemed that none could hear,<BR>

But Vo&#253;voda Rayko saw her, and the curse came to his ear;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And he called the maiden M&aacute;rgita:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Sister,&#8221; he saith, &#8220;do thou</TD></TR></TABLE>

No more curse Rayko the vo&#253;voda. What more can he do now?<BR>

What may he do for himself? And what for Sriyem in this hour?<BR>

What shall he do in Sriyem against the Turkish power?<BR>

While Mirko was the vo&#253;voda, in our cities in their turn<BR>

Were many vo&#253;vodas. Stay thou; their number thou shalt learn.<BR>

&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;<BR>

At P&oacute;tserye on Sava his dwelling Milosh made.<BR>

He was vizier of Lazar in many-towered Belgrade.<BR>

&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;<BR>

In Kr&uacute;shevats, the white city, glorious Lazar had his hall,<BR>

With his fair son beside him, the good lad Stevan the Tall.<BR>

Yug Bogdan, the old hero, with the nine sons of his might,<BR>

Dwelt in another city, Pr&oacute;kuplye the white.<BR>

At the white town of Kursh&uacute;mliya was Strahin, the great ban;<BR>

At T&oacute;plitsa, Milan T&oacute;plitsa, where the chill waters ran.<BR>

At flat K&oacute;saynitsa, Ivan K&oacute;sanchich, the mighty man,<BR>

&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;<BR>

In Travnik, the white, Vuk Br&aacute;nkovich was Lazar&#8217;s high vizier;<BR>

Duke Stepan<A NAME="page_189_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_189_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> in Herzegovina ruled the country without fear.<BR>

&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;<BR>

At Skadar on the B&oacute;yana, Vuk&aacute;shin was the king.<BR>

With his brethren Goyko and &Uacute;glyesha, to help in governing.<BR>

And in Prizrend, where the plowland reacheth so fair and far,<BR>

With his little son, Prince Urosh, was Stepan the Servian tsar.<BR>

&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;<BR>

Star&iacute;na Novak<A NAME="page_189_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_189_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> held the rule on Stara, the mountain old;<BR>

And with him R&aacute;divoye, his brother, called the bold,<BR>

And T&aacute;tomir and Gr&uacute;itsa dwelt with them in the hold.<BR>

&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;<BR>

And, moreover, Bey Kost&aacute;din dwelt in K&uacute;manovo white.<BR>

&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;<BR>

And Prince Marko in white Prilip, in the mansion of his might.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Harken thou, sister Margita, our vo&#253;vodas were they;<BR>

<P>

All of them were among us, and all have passed away.<BR>

Some died in their beds, sister, and some in battle were slain;<BR>

To-day doth Rayko alone of them in Sriyem yet remain,<BR>

Like a dry tree in the mountain grove. What shall he do in this hour?<BR>

What shall he do in Sriyem against the Turkish power?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;From his belt he drew a dagger&#8212;through his live heart it sped;<BR>

On the black earth Rayko of Sriyem, the vo&#253;voda, lay dead.<BR>

And M&aacute;rgita ran to him; with a wailing cry she said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My brothers, Servian vo&#253;vodas; you have been and have passed away!<BR>

How have you left your children and your faithful wives this day?<BR>

Are they not now a footstool, that Turkish feet may rest?<BR>

Are not your monasteries become a Turkish jest?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;She snatched the dagger of Rayko, through her live heart smote it well,<BR>

And dead the wretched maiden by the dead Rayko fell.<BR>
