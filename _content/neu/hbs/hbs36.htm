<H2 ALIGN="center">THE DEATH OF IVO OF SENYE<A NAME="page_199_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_199_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A></H2>

Ivo&#8217;s mother dreamed that darkness was risen Senye around,<BR>

That the clear sky was broken and the bright moon fell to the ground<BR>

On R&uacute;zhitsa church in Senye, and the stars fled far and wide,<BR>

And the daystar rose up bloody, and the cuckoo to her cried&#8212;<BR>

In Senye&#8217;s midst on the holy roof of R&uacute;zhitsa did he perch.<BR>

The woman awoke and took her crutch and hastened to the church,<BR>

And told the Archpriest N&eacute;delko what dream was come to her,<BR>

And to her the priest made clear the dream as an interpreter:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Hearest thou, mother! Ill hast thou dreamed and evil soon will be.<BR>

In that darkness rose round Senye, &#8217;twill be desolate for thee.<BR>

In that the sky was broken and the bright moon fell to the ground<BR>

On R&uacute;zhitsa, Ivo will perish; he hath reached his term and bound.<BR>

In that the stars fled far and wide, will many a widow moan.<BR>

In that bloody rose the daystar, thou wilt be as a cuckoo alone.<BR>

In that it sang on the R&uacute;zhitsa, the Turks will overthrow<BR>

R&uacute;zhitsa, and, though old I be, the Turks will lay me low.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Hardly had he done speaking, when before them Ivo stood.<BR>

The great black steed he rode upon was soaked with the dark blood;<BR>

He had seventeen wounds; in his left hand his cleft right hand he bore.<BR>

He drove the black steed onward the great white church before.<BR>

To his mother he spake: &#8220;From the black steed take me down, mother mine,<BR>

And wash me with cold water and purify with wine.&#8221;<BR>

Swift she obeyed: she took him down from the steed fierce and fine;<BR>

She washed him with cold water, and o&#8217;er him poured the wine.<BR>

His mother asked him: &#8220;What, my son, in Italy befell?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Ivo spake:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Mother, in Italy all things went swift and well;</TD></TR></TABLE>

Enough slaves we took, mother, and enough of treasure bright;<BR>

Safe we turned home. When we were at the camp of the first night,<BR>

A first pursuit o&#8217;ertook us, black warriors that sped<BR>

Upon black steeds; black turbans they wore about the head.<BR>

We fired one volley, mother, we slew them all in fight;<BR>

Of us none perished, mother. At the camp of the second night<BR>

The second pursuit o&#8217;ertook us; the furious heroes sped<BR>

Upon white steeds, white turbans they wore about the head.<BR>

We fired one volley, mother; we slew them all in fight.<BR>

Of us none perished, mother. At the camp of the third night<BR>

The third pursuit o&#8217;ertook us; black cloaks, long guns did they bear.<BR>

We fired a single volley, and began to fight them there;<BR>

Of them none perished, mother; of us all fell in the fray,<BR>

Excepting thy son Ivo, at last that got away.<BR>

And he is wounded; in his left hand his right hand hath he brought.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;So Ivo spake, and forthwith with his dear soul he fought;<BR>

He breathed, and released from prison thereby was the spirit light.<BR>

He died, and his ancient mother&#8212;O evil was her plight!<BR>

May God give him a dwelling place in pleasant paradise,<BR>

And health to us, my brethren, and merriment likewise!<BR>
