<H2 ALIGN="center">THE SERPENT BRIDEGROOM</H2>

I <SMALL>WILL</SMALL> tell you a marvel, brethren, how the King of Budim was wed,<BR>

And nine full years passed over, yet there was no child to his bed.<BR>

Forth issued King Mil&uacute;tin; he went to the forest-close;<BR>

But God and fortune granted him not to strike the stags and does.<BR>

And his thirst was great; to a chilly spring Mil&uacute;tin went his way,<BR>

And drank the chilly water. Then down &#8217;neath a fir he lay.<BR>

Three vilas of the hill came then, thereby their thirst to slake,<BR>

And gossip by the water; and the eldest of them spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Harken, belov&egrave;d daughters! Harken me now, and hear!<BR>

Since the King of Budim married, now is it full nine year;<BR>

And yet no child of his heart hath he to cherish and hold dear.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Said the vila also: &#8220;Of any herb doth either of you know,<BR>

By the virtue whereof, hereafter, his wife with child shall go?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But the younger twain said nothing. Only the eldest said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;If the king knew all my knowledge, he would gather every maid<BR>

In Budim, and before them the dry gold would he set,<BR>

Until their hands should have woven thereof a splendid net.<BR>

Down on the quiet Danube, he would throw the fair net in.<BR>

In it, a great fish would he take; and golden is every fin.<BR>

He would take the right fin from it; then back the fish would he throw,<BR>

And give the fin to the queen to eat. Straightway with child would she go.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But King Mil&uacute;tin saw them, and heard whate&#8217;er was said;<BR>

And he went to the town of Budim and gathered every maid<BR>

In Budim, and before them the good dry gold he set,<BR>

Until their hands had woven thereof a splendid net.<BR>

Down on the quiet Danube he threw the fair net in.<BR>

In it he took a mighty fish, and golden was every fin.<BR>

He took the right fin from it; and back the fish did he throw;<BR>

He gave the fin to his queen to eat. Straightway with child did she go.<BR>

A year she carried her burden; and then the time came on<BR>

Of the bringing forth of the kingly child, but she did not bear a son.<BR>

<P>

Nay, a fierce serpent was it! On the earth when it did fall,<BR>

Straightway the serpent crept away through a crevice in the wall.<BR>

And straight the queen departed; unto the king she spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;For the child of thy heart, it is hard, O king, to be merry for his sake.<BR>

No son but a serpent! What time on the earth the snake did fall,<BR>

Forthwith the serpent crept away through a crevice in the wall.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Then said the king: &#8220;Now glory to God for his gift&#8217;s sake.&#8221;&#8212;<BR>

Then seven years passed over. From the wall the serpent spake:<BR>

&#8220;Wherefore, thou King of Budim, findest thou no bride for me?&#8221;<BR>

Sore was Mil&uacute;tin troubled, but at length aloud said he:<BR>

&#8220;My serpent, my evil offspring, who will give a maid to a snake?&#8221;<BR>

But thus to him the serpent raised up his voice and spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My father, the King of Budim, do thou saddle Swallow, and wend<BR>

To the tsar. He will give thee a maid for me in the city of Prizrend.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the King of Budim heard it, he saddled Swallow, the steed;<BR>

There went unto a hero, a hero then indeed!<BR>

He came to the city of Prizrend. When he came &#8217;neath the tsar&#8217;s tower,<BR>

The tsar looked down upon him, and saw him in that hour.<BR>

The tsar came down unto him, and in the open square<BR>

The heroes spread out wide their arms, and kissed each other there,<BR>

And each asked how fared the other. The tsar the king did lead<BR>

To the palace; to the new stable the servants took the steed.<BR>

For three white days with yellow wine their thirst the kings did slake,<BR>

Till they had ta&#8217;en their fill thereof, and then the brandy spake.<BR>

Sore was the King of Budim by his embassy distressed.<BR>

The Tsar of Prizrend saw it, and thus the king addressed:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;I conjure thee, King of Budim; what trouble troubles thee,<BR>

That thou art distressed in spirit before my lords and me?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The king to the tsar spake likewise:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;O tsar of Prizrend, hear!</TD></TR></TABLE>

When I married, no son of my heart was born for the space of full nine year.<BR>

When that their term was over, and the nine year course was run,<BR>

To me was born a serpent instead of a little son;<BR>

And, at its birth, unto the earth did the fierce serpent fall,<BR>

And forthwith the serpent crept away through a crevice in the wall.<BR>

When seven years were over, therefrom did the serpent call:<BR>

&#8216;Wherefore, thou King of Budim, dost thou find no bride for me?&#8217;<BR>

And unto the fierce serpent I answered finally:<BR>

&#8216;My serpent, my evil offspring, who will give a maid to a snake?&#8217;<BR>

But thereupon the serpent lifted his voice and spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;My father, the King of Budim, do thou saddle Swallow and wend<BR>

To the tsar. He will give thee a maid for me in the city of Prizrend.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;And tsar, a wretch am I in this. But I labored and came from afar.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And unto the king in answer outspake at last the tsar:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Hearest thou, King of Budim? To Budim for me thou shalt go.<BR>

There shalt thou ask the serpent in the wall, whether or no<BR>

He will lead the wooers from Budim to Prizrend through the land,<BR>

So that no sun shall warm them, nor dew upon them stand.<BR>

If in such wise the serpent will venture them to lead,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 265------------------------>

<A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A>

</P>

Then for a bride to the serpent I will give the maid indeed.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the King of Budim heard it, forth was steed Swallow led.<BR>

He threw himself on the back of the steed, and forth away he sped,<BR>

Over the level country, like a star in the lucid sky.<BR>

And the king thought within him, when Budim he came nigh:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Alas! In the name of God the One, now whither shall I wend,<BR>

To give to the serpent in the wall the greetings the tsar doth send?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Before the gates of Budim but a little space was he.<BR>

Spake the serpent: &#8220;My father, gave the tsar his maiden unto me?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Said the king:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My evil offspring, if thou darest, snake, to wend</TD></TR></TABLE>

With the crowd of gay-clad wooers from Budim to Prizrend,<BR>

So that no sun shall warm them, nor dew upon them stand,<BR>

The tsar will lightly surrender the maiden to thy hand.<BR>

But if the crowd of wooers thou wilt not venture to lead,<BR>

No maiden of his whatever will the tsar give thee indeed.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But the serpent said:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 266------------------------>

<A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A>

</TD></TR><TR><TD><TD>&#8220;The wooers, now get them ready to hand.</TD></TR></TABLE>

We will go hence for the maiden; I will lead them through the land,<BR>

So that no sun shall warm them, nor dew upon them stand.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;They gathered a host of wooers, a thousand with all speed;<BR>

They came to the king&#8217;s courtyard. They brought forth Swallow the steed;<BR>

Alone in the courtyard stood the steed. Then the quick heralds cried:<BR>

&#8220;Make ready, gay-clad wooers! Make ready, groom of the bride!&#8221;<BR>

And when in the wall&#8217;s crevice the serpent heard the call,<BR>

Forthwith crawled down the serpent from the crevice in the wall;<BR>

By the knee he gripped the charger; on the saddle he coiled and lay.<BR>

Then out through Budim the city they hastened on their way.<BR>

From Budim to Prizrend a dark blue cloud drave o&#8217;er them through the land,<BR>

So that no sun could warm them, nor dew upon them stand.<BR>

When they came to Prizrend, they led their steeds through the tsar&#8217;s courtyard there;<BR>

But the serpent guided not Swallow that went alone through the square.<BR>

Gloriously the tsar welcomed them with gifts that were splendid indeed,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 267------------------------>

<A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A>

</P>

To every wooer a shirt of silk, to the groom a hawk and a steed,<BR>

And moreover the maiden of Prizrend. Then the quick heralds cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Make ready, wooers, and groomsman, and bringer of the bride!<BR>

Make ready, maiden of Prizrend! It is time for us to ride.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The wooers and the maiden, they mounted one and all.<BR>

When the serpent heard it, down he came from the crevice in the wall;<BR>

He gripped the charger by the knee; on the saddle he coiled and lay.<BR>

Then out through Prizrend the city they hastened on their way,<BR>

But evermore above them drave on the dark blue cloud.<BR>

The wooers spurred their horses, until they trampled proud;<BR>

And thereupon the serpent on Swallow that did ride,<BR>

He made the charger trample on the pavement in his pride.<BR>

He goaded him so fiercely, that the steed from end to end<BR>

Hath ruined all the pavement in the city of Prizrend.<BR>

Plague strike on it! In twelve full years the masons scarce will mend<BR>

The damage that upon that time unto the tsar was done.<BR>

And merrily and with good heart to Budim they were gone,<BR>

And anew the marriage festival they held a full week more,<BR>

And solemnized it duly until the rites were o&#8217;er.<BR>

Then each returned unto the house, and the serpent to the wall,<BR>

And the king remained a season within the council-hall.<BR>

&#8195;Time came to bring together the bridegroom and the bride.<BR>

They brought her to the tower; to the highest room they hied;<BR>

They left her in the highest room. At the middle of the night<BR>

There was a sound of voices in the chamber in the height;<BR>

And the Lady Queen in the tower stole on from floor to floor,<BR>

Till she reached the highest story; then she opened the chamber door.<BR>

What saw she in the chamber? A mighty marvel therein!<BR>

On a cushion in the chamber, there lay a serpent-skin;<BR>

On the pillow a good hero in slumber deep was laid;<BR>

And the damsel out of Prizrend, he held the lovely maid.<BR>

A mother has joy of her children. She stole the serpent-skin;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 269------------------------>

<A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A>

</P>

She bore it to the living fire, and swiftly threw it in.<BR>

To the king, her lord and master, she ran forth hastily:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O king, upon this hour it is well with thee and me!<BR>

I went to the high chamber, and opened the door. Therein<BR>

On a cushion in the chamber there lay a serpent-skin;<BR>

On the pillow a good hero in slumber deep was laid;<BR>

The damsel out of Prizrend, he held the lovely maid.<BR>

And forthwith from the chamber I stole the serpent-skin,<BR>

And took it to the living fire, and quickly threw it in.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;What is this, wife? May the serpent now seize thee and devour!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And they hastened forth together to the summit of the tower.<BR>

What saw they? A mighty marvel! On the pillow a hero dead;<BR>

The maid of Prizrend embraced him. She lifted her voice and said:<BR>

&#8220;Alas! In the name of the one God, I am widowed and alone!<BR>

My mother, for me&#8212;God slay thee!&#8212;little enow hast thou done,<BR>

And this woe hast thou brought upon thyself.&#8221; So the mother lost her son.<BR>

Our fathers lied unto us, and we repeat their lies.<BR>
