<H2 ALIGN="center">MUSICH STEVAN</H2>

I<SMALL>N</SMALL> Maydan white as silver, in his fair lordly house,<BR>

Idle sits Musich Stevan, on the good wine to carouse.<BR>

The servant V&aacute;istina poured it forth his thirst to slake,<BR>

And Stevan drank his fill thereof, and to the henchman spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My good son V&aacute;istina, I will lie down to sleep.<BR>

Do thou then eat thy dinner, and of the wine drink deep,<BR>

And then look forth on the open sky because of my behest,<BR>

To see if the day-star stand in the east, or the clear moon in the west;<BR>

To see if the time be come at last for us to gird and go<BR>

To the meeting place that the tsar hath set on the field of K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

Thou knowest the oath we took, my son, and the curse that then was laid<BR>

On the vo&#253;voda or henchman that Tsar Lazarus betrayed:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Who springeth of a Servian house, in whom Serb blood doth run,<BR>

Who cometh not to battle at K&oacute;sovo, may he never have a son,<BR>

And no child of his heart whatever! May naught grow under his hand,<BR>

Neither the yellow liquor, nor the white wheat in the land!<BR>

<P>

May he like iron be rusted, and his stock dwindle alway!&#8217;&#8201;&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And thereupon brave Stevan on the bolster soft he lay.<BR>

V&aacute;istina the henchman, he sitteth him down to dine,<BR>

And at his good lord&#8217;s table he hath his fill of the wine,<BR>

And he goeth to look at the open sky because of his lord&#8217;s behest,<BR>

To see if the day-star stand in the east, or the clear moon in the west.<BR>

And he seeth it is the season for them to gird and go<BR>

Unto Tsar Lazar&#8217;s meeting place in the field of K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

He went unto the stables and led the horses forth;<BR>

He saddled the steeds, and on them set caparisons of worth,<BR>

One for himself, and the other is for his lord that tide.<BR>

And he bringeth a flag from the palace, with a great cross glorified;<BR>

Silk is the flag and golden are the crosses wrought thereon,<BR>

And the icon of Stevan&#8217;s patron, the icon of St. John.<BR>

He set the banner against the wall, and went unto the tower<BR>

To wake his lord, but his lady came to him in that hour,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And she greeted and embraced him:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD>

</TD></TR><TR><TD><TD>&#8220;Brother in God,&#8221; said she,</TD></TR></TABLE>

&#8220;My servant V&aacute;istina, by God I conjure thee,<BR>

And by St. John moreover. A faithful knave art thou,<BR>

Henceforth shalt thou be my brother; but awake not thy master now,<BR>

Since an evil dream of a flock of doves this night is come to me.<BR>

With falcons twain from my lord his place to K&oacute;sovo did they flee;<BR>

Amid the camp of Murad they lighted nor came again:<BR>

That is your omen, brother. So ponder lest you be slain.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But the servant V&aacute;istina, unto the dame said he:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Sister, I cannot break my faith with the lord of thee and me,<BR>

For thou wast not at the swearing, nor knowest what curse was laid<BR>

On the vo&#253;voda or henchman that Tsar Lazarus betrayed:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Who springeth of a Servian house, in whom Serb blood doth run,<BR>

Who cometh not to battle at K&oacute;sovo, may he never have a son,<BR>

And no child of his heart whatever! May naught grow under his hand,<BR>

Neither the yellow liquor, nor the white wheat in the land!<BR>

May he like iron be rusted, and his stock dwindle alway!&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;And I dare not break my plighted faith to thy lord and mine this day.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And he went to his lord in the tower: &#8220;Rise up, it is time to go!&#8221;<BR>

Stevan stood up before him, and washed his neck and brow,<BR>

And put on lordly raiment and an inlaid saber fine;<BR>

To the fair glory of his God he drank the yellow wine,<BR>

And to his own good journey and the fair cross did he drain<BR>

The wine at his own table: he drank not there again.<BR>

&#8195;They mounted the two good chargers, they spread the banners abroad;<BR>

The drums beat and the flutes blew loud, and the chiefs rode forth with God.<BR>

Over the field of K&oacute;sovo did the white morning stand;<BR>

The Maid of K&oacute;sovo met them with a cup in either hand.<BR>

The cups are golden and empty. On her arm is a tire for the head,<BR>

A cap with milk-white feathers that are wound with silver thread,<BR>

And all about the midst thereof is it wrought with golden braid,<BR>

And a row of pearls, moreover. Unto her Stevan said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;God&#8217;s aid be with thee, my sister! And where hast thou seen the fight?<BR>

<P>

Where found&#8217;st thou the cap? Give unto me the silken cap so white,<BR>

That I may find whose is the cap, what marshal&#8217;s it may be,<BR>

And be lucky upon my journey. And I will keep faith with thee.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Answered the Maid of K&oacute;sovo:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Thou lord of kingly mien,</TD></TR></TABLE>

My mother roused me at daybreak; at no fight have I been.<BR>

I would draw water in S&iacute;tnitsa. He had overflowed his banks;<BR>

And, brother, he beareth the horses and the heroes in their ranks,<BR>

And turbans, and Turkish fezes, and the Serb caps white as milk.<BR>

I plunged into the S&iacute;tnitsa, and seized the cap of silk,<BR>

And I bear to my little brother the fair cap silken and white,<BR>

For I am young, and the feathers are pleasant in my sight.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;She gave the cap to the marshal; I wot he knew it well!<BR>

He smote himself, and the sad tears down from his cheeks they fell.<BR>

The golden buckle on his sleeve rent the satin on his knee:<BR>

&#8220;Grief unto God! The prince&#8217;s curse hath fallen upon me!&#8221;<BR>

<P>

He gave her the cap, and royally out of his pouch he told<BR>

In the hand of the Maid of K&oacute;sovo three ducats of yellow gold:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Take, sister! I go to K&oacute;sovo and the battle on the plain.<BR>

By Christ, I will give thee a better gift, if I come back again!<BR>

But if I die in the fight thereby, aye keep my gift in mind.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;They spurred the steeds and hard away they galloped like the wind;<BR>

They forded the flood of S&iacute;tnitsa, to the tsar&#8217;s camp they drew.<BR>

Three Turkish pashas Stevan smote down and overthrew;<BR>

Against the fourth was he storming, but the Turks o&#8217;erwhelmed him then.<BR>

With him died V&aacute;istina and twelve thousand of his men.<BR>

There did the folly of the Serbs make as of nothing worth<BR>

The glory of Tsar Lazar and the Kingdom of the Earth.<BR>
