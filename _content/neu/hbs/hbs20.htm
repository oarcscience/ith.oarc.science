<H2 ALIGN="center">UROSH AND THE SONS OF MARNY&Aacute;VA</H2>

I<SMALL>N</SMALL> the fair field of K&oacute;sovo were four pavilions pight<BR>

By the fair church of K&oacute;sovo, Sam&oacute;drezha the white.<BR>

Vuk&aacute;shin lay in one fair tent, and Lord &Uacute;glyesha was nigh;<BR>

Goyko the duke and Urosh, the tsar&#8217;s son, lay thereby.<BR>

The tsars rob one another of the empire of the tsars,<BR>

And they yearn to slay each other with the gilded scimitars.<BR>

They know not whose is the empire. &#8220;It is mine,&#8221; Vuk&aacute;shin saith,<BR>

But the great Lord &Uacute;glyesha answers: &#8220;It is mine, upon my faith.&#8221;<BR>

And Goyko, the proud vo&#253;voda, saith likewise: &#8220;It is mine&#8221;;<BR>

But the son of the tsar, Prince Urosh, in silence must he pine,<BR>

For he dares not break his silence before those angry ones,<BR>

Before the three great brothers, Marny&aacute;va&#8217;s mighty sons.<BR>

&#8195;Vuk&aacute;shin writeth a letter, and a herald doth he send,<BR>

To N&eacute;delko, the archpriest, in the city of Prizrend;<BR>

And he bids him come to K&oacute;sovo, that he may there decide<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 112------------------------>

</P>

To whom of the four princes the realm belongs, this tide;<BR>

For he had given the sacrament unto the glorious tsar,<BR>

And shriven him; and the ancient books, with the archpriest they are.<BR>

&Uacute;glyesha writeth a letter and a herald doth he send<BR>

To N&eacute;delko, the archpriest, in the city of Prizrend;<BR>

And Goyko, the great vo&#253;voda, he writeth yet a third,<BR>

And sendeth a fiery messenger to the archpriest with his word;<BR>

And the son of the tsar, Prince Urosh, sent a letter likewise away.<BR>

In secret the fiery heralds went with their letters on that day.<BR>

By the house of the Archpriest N&eacute;delko, in Prizrend, the white town,<BR>

The heralds met, but the archpriest out of his house was gone,<BR>

For he sat at the service in the midst of matin song.<BR>

So fierce were those fierce heralds, so keen the strong of the strong,<BR>

That they came not down from the chargers, but through the door did dash,<BR>

And the good Archpriest N&eacute;delko they smote with the woven lash:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Come swift, thou priest, to K&oacute;sovo, that there thou mayst decide<BR>

To whom of the four princes the realm belongs, this tide;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 113------------------------>

<A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A>

</P>

For thou didst give the sacrament unto the glorious tsar,<BR>

And shrovest him, and the ancient books of learning with thee they are.<BR>

If thou comest not to K&oacute;sovo, forthwith thou shalt lose thy head.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Then wept the Archpriest N&eacute;delko, and unto them he said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Till we are done with the service, get hence, ye strong of the strong,<BR>

And it will be shown hereafter to whom doth the realm belong.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Out rode the heralds straightway. When the liturgy was done,<BR>

Forth came the Archpriest N&eacute;delko, and spake to all and one:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;With me the tsar took sacrament, to me he did confess;<BR>

But I asked not of his kingdom, but of his wickedness.<BR>

But to the house of Marko in the town of Prilip hie,<BR>

For Marko was my pupil to read in charactery;<BR>

And the good Marko Kr&aacute;lyevich was a scribe before the tsar,<BR>

And the books of yore with their ancient lore, this day with him they are;<BR>

And who shall have the kingdom, Prince Marko shall make known.<BR>

He speaketh the truth, for he feareth none save the true God alone.&#8221;<BR>

<P>

</P>

&#8195;To Prilip, to Prince Marko&#8217;s house, went on the heralds four;<BR>

They came unto the milk-white house, and smote with the ring on the door.<BR>

And Y&eacute;vrosima heard it and called unto her son:<BR>

&#8220;Do thy father&#8217;s heralds at the door with the ring strike thereon?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko arose and opened the door. They bowed where they did stand:<BR>

&#8220;God bless thee, Marko!&#8221; But Marko, he stroked them with his hand:<BR>

&#8220;Now welcome, sons! With the champions and the tsars are all things well?&#8221;<BR>

But thereupon the heralds down on their knees they fell:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;The lords are well, Prince Marko, but they are not at peace this night;<BR>

In K&oacute;sovo they quarrel, by Sam&oacute;drezha the white;<BR>

The tsars rob one another of the empire of the tsars,<BR>

And they yearn to slay each other with the gilded scimitars;<BR>

But to whom the realm belongeth, no man of them doth know,<BR>

Wherefore they cite thee to tell them on the field of K&oacute;sovo.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Prince Marko went into the house:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My mother of delight,</TD></TR></TABLE>

In K&oacute;sovo they quarrel, by Sam&oacute;drezha the white;<BR>

The tsars rob one another of the empire of the tsars,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 115------------------------>

</P>

And they yearn to slay each other with the gilded scimitars;<BR>

But to whom the realm belongeth, no man of them doth know.<BR>

Therefore they cite me to tell them on the field of K&oacute;sovo.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Though greatly Marko loved the truth, she conjured him the more:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Let not my rearing be accurst in thee, the son I bore,<BR>

For thy father or his brethren speak not false, whate&#8217;er the stress,<BR>

But according to the living God speak out his righteousness.<BR>

Hurl not the spirit, Marko; save thou the soul, my son.<BR>

Rather lose life than that the soul should have a stain thereon.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko brought forth the ancient books, and mounted Dapple the gray;<BR>

On Dapple&#8217;s back he rode the track to K&oacute;sovo that day.<BR>

And when he came to the king&#8217;s tent Vuk&aacute;shin stood thereby:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Here is my good son Marko, and fortunate am I!<BR>

For he will say, I trow, this day, the realm of the tsars is mine.<BR>

Then from the father to the son shall the realm stand in our line.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko heard, but said naught; from the tent he turned away.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 116------------------------>

</P>

Vo&#253;voda &Uacute;glyesha saw him, and aloud his thought did he say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Here is my nephew Marko, and a lucky man am I!<BR>

For I trow he will say to me this day that mine is the empery.<BR>

Say, Marko, that the realm is mine. We will share the government.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But Marko the Prince said nothing, nor turned unto the tent.<BR>

Goyko, the vo&#253;voda, saw him, what time he went thereby:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Here is my nephew Marko, and a lucky man am I!<BR>

He will say that unto me, Goyko, the empire doth belong,<BR>

Because I erstwhile loved him, when he was weak and young.<BR>

For I loved him very dearly, and in the bosom fold<BR>

Of my mantle did I keep him like an apple of red gold;<BR>

Where&#8217;er I went upon my steed was Marko wont to ride.<BR>

Say then, Prince Marko, in this wise, what time thou shalt decide,<BR>

That all the empire of the tsars is given unto me,<BR>

And thou shalt be the overlord, and I the tsar at thy knee.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But Marko aye kept silence, and turned not to the tent.<BR>

To Urosh&#8217; white pavilion upon his way he went;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 117------------------------>

<A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A>

</P>

Unto the tsar&#8217;s fair tent he rode. Urosh leaped up awake<BR>

From the fair silken cushions, and to the prince he spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;A lucky man am I to-day; my godfather I see!<BR>

Marko the Prince will say to whom the Servian realms shall be.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Then they embraced each other, and wished each other well;<BR>

And sate upon the cushions until the evening fell.<BR>

When the dark night was over, and the white morning shone,<BR>

They rang the bells for matins, and to church the lords are gone.<BR>

They came forth from the service before the church to dine,<BR>

And then they ate the sugar, and drank the brandy-wine.<BR>

Marko looks on the ancient books, and a great word saith he:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O thou, my sire, Vuk&aacute;shin, is thy realm too small for thee?<BR>

May a curse go out and through it, for ye seize another&#8217;s reign!<BR>

And &Uacute;glyesha, my uncle, too small is thy domain?<BR>

May a curse go out and through it, for another&#8217;s realm would ye seize!<BR>

And thou, my uncle, Goyko, to a strait are thy provinces?<BR>

May a curse go out and through them, for an other&#8217;s realm would ye steal!<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 118------------------------>

<A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A>

</P>

See&#8212;and may God forget you!&#8212;what the book doth reveal!<BR>

For the realm belongeth to Urosh, from the father to the son;<BR>

The child is of the tsar his house, and in him the line goes on,<BR>

And the tsar left it to him at the season when he died.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Vuk&aacute;shin, when he heard it, drew the dagger from his side;<BR>

On his son leaped Vuk&aacute;shin, to stab him in that hour,<BR>

And Marko fled before him, for he had not will nor power<BR>

In arms against his father to lift the hand and fight.<BR>

Marko ran round about the church, Samodrezha the white;<BR>

Three times round white Samodrezha the circle did they make;<BR>

The king well-nigh had caught him, when a voice to Marko spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Into the church, Prince Marko!&#8221; the voice from the church did say,<BR>

&#8220;For the sake of truth thou wilt perish at thy father&#8217;s hand this day.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko ran hard into the church as the doors wide open drew;<BR>

Vuk&aacute;shin fell against them as again the doors shut to,<BR>

And smote the beam with his dagger. Therefrom did the red blood drain.<BR>

<P>

</P>

The king repented: &#8220;By the one God, I dread my son have I slain.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;A voice spoke to him from the church: &#8220;Dost hear where thou dost stand?<BR>

Thou smot&#8217;st not thy son, but an angel, with the dagger in thy hand.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The king was wroth at Marko, and cursed him thereupon:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My son, God slay thee! Mayst thou have nor sepulcher nor son!<BR>

May the soul go not from thee till thou servest the Turk in war!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;His father cursed him, but he won the blessing of the tsar:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O my godfather Marko, may God thee ever shield!<BR>

May thy face shine in the council; thy saber slash in the field!<BR>

May none excel thee in battle, and thy name far and wide<BR>

Be everywhere remembered while the sun and moon abide!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;So spake Vuk&aacute;shin and the tsar, and so did it betide.<BR>
