<H2 ALIGN="center">THE BATTLE OF K&Oacute;SOVO</H2>

A <SMALL>GRAY</SMALL> hawk from Jerusalem, with a swallow in his beak,<BR>

Flew onward into Servia, Tsar Lazarus to seek,<BR>

Nay, it was never a great gray hawk with a swallow that flew so far,<BR>

But Elijah, our Lady&#8217;s messenger, with her tidings to the tsar.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Tsar Lazar read the letter:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;O king whom the Serbs revere,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Wilt thou choose for thine own the Kingdom of God or an earthly empire here?<BR>

For if, instead of a heavenly rule, thou choosest an earthly realm,<BR>

Leap astride of the steed this tide and do on hauberk and helm;<BR>

Belt about thee the girdle of war and look to saber and dirk,<BR>

Tighten at need the girth of the steed&#8212;and here shalt thou slaughter the Turk.<BR>

But if thou choosest the Empire of Christ, and a kingdom of God&#8217;s own,<BR>

Build him a church by K&oacute;sovo, but not of marble stone;<BR>

But found it on silk and satin and its corners in scarlet fine.<BR>

Therein shall thine armies take of Christ the white bread and the wine.<BR>

Thou shalt marshal the army of the Serbs, and upon that dreadful day<BR>

<P>

In the van of the war thou shalt die, O tsar, with the whole of thine array.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the tsar heard the holy word, his thoughts came two and two:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Dear God, what is the whole of thine heart, and what is the deed to do?<BR>

Which shall I hold for the better realm? Man&#8217;s sovereignty may die,<BR>

But the Kingdom of the Living God, its power goes on for aye.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Tsar Lazarus has chosen at last God&#8217;s Kingdom for his own;<BR>

And he built a church at K&oacute;sovo, but not of marble stone;<BR>

On satin and on velvet he made the walls to stand,<BR>

And he summoned our lord the patriarch, and bishops twelve to hand.<BR>

The armies came before him, what time the prayers were said,<BR>

And the good priests gave to them Christ&#8217;s wine and milk-white bread.<BR>

&#8195;And when on level K&oacute;sovo that army up was drawn,<BR>

The Turks smote against K&oacute;sovo at the breaking of the dawn.<BR>

Yug Bogdan with the vanguard came up against their line;<BR>

The young gray hawks were with him, his gallant children nine;<BR>

And after every standard came thrice three thousand men,<BR>

But by Yug Bogdan&#8217;s banner were thousands two and ten.<BR>

They came upon the infidel, that army of renown,<BR>

And slashed and slew among them; seven pashas smote they down.<BR>

The eighth gave way before them; Yug Bogdan there was slain;<BR>

His nine gray falcons and their host came never home again.<BR>

&#8195;The children of Marny&aacute;va moved on with their array;<BR>

Vuk&aacute;shin, Goyko, &Uacute;glyesha were marshals of the fray;<BR>

And the ninth Turkish pasha before their charge fell back,<BR>

But &Uacute;glyesha and Goyko were slain in the attack,<BR>

Two of Marny&aacute;va&#8217;s children; and terribly, indeed,<BR>

Was King Vuk&aacute;shin wounded, and trampled by the steed.<BR>

&#8195;Now smitten was the center and smitten was the van,<BR>

And Ertseg Stepan with the rear into the battle ran.<BR>

Brave warriors had Ertseg, full sixty thousand men;<BR>

They trampled through the tumult and smote the Turks again.<BR>

Nine pashas fell before them, the tenth drew back in dread;<BR>

But Ertseg and his army were numbered with the dead.<BR>

&#8195;And now rode out Tsar Lazarus with his whole host along,<BR>

Seventy thousand gallant Serbs and seven thousand strong.<BR>

They scattered the Turks by K&oacute;sovo; they scarce would let them stand<BR>

To look upon the army for the lifting of the brand.<BR>

Then would the tsar have won the war for Servia by God&#8217;s aid&#8212;<BR>

God&#8217;s curse be on Vuk Br&aacute;nkovich, the dastard that betrayed<BR>

The father of his wife that tide!&#8212;the tsar of all the land!<BR>

The Turks smote down Tsar Lazarus with the edges of the brand.<BR>

Seven and seventy thousand men lay dead upon the sod,<BR>

All gallant Serbs, and their pure blood was dear unto their God.<BR>
