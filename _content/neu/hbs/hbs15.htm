<H2 ALIGN="center">THE DEATH OF THE MOTHER OF THE Y&Uacute;GOVICHI</H2>

D<SMALL>EAR</SMALL> God, a mighty marvel is fallen at K&oacute;sovo!<BR>

In the host were Yug&#8217;s nine children and their father the tenth also.<BR>

The mother of Yug&#8217;s children she prayed God in her pain<BR>

For the eyes of a hawk and a swan&#8217;s white wing to fly along the plain,<BR>

To see her nine strong children and Yug her lord beside.<BR>

And what she prayed for, verily, God granted her that tide.<BR>

God gave her eagle eyesight and the swan&#8217;s pinion white,<BR>

And she found low in K&oacute;sovo her children slain in fight,<BR>

And old Yug Bogdan with them, and beside them nine good spears,<BR>

And on the goodly spearshafts there perched nine falcons fierce;<BR>

Roaming about the lances the chargers nine did stray;<BR>

Amid them were nine lions. And the steeds began to neigh,<BR>

And the lions roared together, and the falcons screamed aloud;<BR>

But the proud heart of the mother I wot it was unbowed.<BR>

&#8195;But the lions and the horses she took them by the brows,<BR>

And the good falcons with them, and brought them to the house.<BR>

The wives of her strong children afar they saw her come,<BR>

And calling like to cuckoos went out to lead her home.<BR>

Moaning before the neighing steeds and the loud beasts thereby<BR>

Wept the nine noble ladies, and the hawks took up their cry.<BR>

Yet wept not that stern mother, and her heart was undismayed,<BR>

&#8195;About the middle of the night the steed of Damyan neighed.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Then spake the mother to Damyan&#8217;s wife:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My daughter, what is this?</TD></TR></TABLE>

And wherefore neighs in the nighttide that dappled steed of his?<BR>

Is he hungry for the milk-white wheat? Doth he thirst for Zvechan&#8217;s wave?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And the fair wife of Damyan in this wise answer gave:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My mother, Damyan&#8217;s mother, no wheat the steed doth crave,<BR>

Nor in the darkened nighttime doth he thirst for Zvechan&#8217;s wave;<BR>

But aye hath Damyan taught him, and bidden him abide<BR>

To champ his oats till midnight, thereafter forth to ride.<BR>

Now he sorrows that his master mounts not his back this tide.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Yet wept not that stern mother, and her heart was undismayed.<BR>

&#8195;That morn flew by two ravens, unto the shoulders red,<BR>

Upon the blackness of their beaks the milk-white froth it shone;<BR>

And they bare the hand of a hero and a golden ring thereon.<BR>

In the bosom of the mother, the dead hand they let fall;<BR>

And unto her daughter, Damyan&#8217;s wife, in a loud voice did she call:<BR>

&#8220;My daughter, wife of Damyan, what hero&#8217;s hand is this?&#8221;<BR>

And the daughter made her answer: &#8220;Our Damyan&#8217;s hand it is;<BR>

Shall I not know the ring I gave the day that we were wed?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The mother lifted the hero&#8217;s hand, and fondled it, and said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O hand, who plucked thee off, and where apple-like didst thou grow?<BR>

Thou grewest in my bosom; thou wast plucked in K&oacute;sovo.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Then swelled her heart within her, and her soul was rent in twain<BR>

For her children and their father that at K&oacute;sovo were slain.<BR>
