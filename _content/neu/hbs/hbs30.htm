<H2 ALIGN="center">MARKO DRINKS WINE IN RAMAZ&Aacute;N</H2>

T<SMALL>HERE</SMALL> was an edict sent abroad by the Tsar Suleym&aacute;n<BR>

That none should drink the yellow wine in the month of Ramaz&aacute;n,<BR>

That none should wear green tunics, nor silver-inlaid dirks,<BR>

And that none should dance, moreover, with the women of the Turks.<BR>

But Marko dances among them, and inlaid with silver wan<BR>

Is his blade, and green is his tunic, and he tipples in Ramaz&aacute;n.<BR>

And the Turkish priests and pilgrims, he maketh them drink likewise.<BR>

And the Turks go to the palace unto Suleym&aacute;n&#8217;s assize:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Father and mother of us an art thou, Tsar Suleym&aacute;n.<BR>

Saith not thine edict: none shall drink liquor in Ramaz&aacute;n;<BR>

And that none shall wear green tunics, nor silver-inlaid dirks;<BR>

And that none shall dance, moreover, with the women of the Turks?<BR>

Now Marko dances among them; and inlaid with silver wan<BR>

Is his blade; and green is his tunic; and he tipples in Ramaz&aacute;n.<BR>

Wine he may drink and welcome, if it seem good in his eyes,<BR>

But the Turkish priests and pilgrirns, he maketh them drink likewise.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the tsar heard their story, he summoned his heralds twain:<BR>

&#8220;Go, heralds, to Prince Marko, bid him come hither amain.&#8221;<BR>

Forth issued the two heralds; upon their way they went,<BR>

And they found Prince Marko drinking in the shadow of his tent.<BR>

And a cup that held twelve measures is ready to his hand.<BR>

The heralds twain gave unto him the word of the tsar&#8217;s command:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Dost thou then hear, Prince Marko? It is good in the tsar&#8217;s eyes<BR>

That thou come to his council, and the court of his assize.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;O, angry was Prince Marko! He snatched the goblet up,<BR>

And he smote the tsars two heralds in his anger, with the cup.<BR>

The cup rang and the head rang; the blood and wine ran free.<BR>

And Marko went to the tsars assize, and sat at the tsar&#8217;s right knee.<BR>

And the black cap of sable fur he pulled across his face,<BR>

And he laid his saber across his breast, and his hand upon his mace:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My foster child, Prince Marko,&#8221; said the Tsar Suleym&aacute;n,<BR>

Mine edict saith: none shall drink wine in the month of Ramaz&aacute;n;<BR>

And none shall wear green tunics, nor silver-inlaid dirks,<BR>

And none shall dance, moreover, with the women of the Turks.<BR>

Now here be worthy Moslems that have spoken evilly.<BR>

Alas, my poor son Marko, I wot they have slandered thee!<BR>

That thou dancest with Turkish matrons, and inlaid with silver wan<BR>

Is thy blade; and green is thy tunic; and thou tipplest in Ramaz&aacute;n;<BR>

And the Turkish priests and pilgrims, thou makest them drink likewise!<BR>

Now wherefore pullest thou, my son, thy cap across thine eyes?<BR>

Why is thy mace beside thee, and thy saber across thy breast?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And forthwith strong Prince Marko Tsar Suleym&aacute;n addressed:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O thou, my foster father, the great Tsar Suleym&aacute;n,<BR>

It is permitted of my faith to drink in Ramaz&aacute;n.<BR>

And for the priests and pilgrims, my honor would be gone,<BR>

If they should look upon me, and I should drink alone.<BR>

If I wear a good green tunic, I am young; it becomes my youth.<BR>

If I gird an inlaid saber, I paid my money in sooth,<BR>

If I dance with the Turkish women, O tsar, I am yet unwed,<BR>

And once, O tsar, a woman had come not to thy bed,<BR>

If I pull my cap on my forehead, it burns, for I speak with the tsar,<BR>

And for the freeing of my mace, and drawing the scimitar,<BR>

O tsar, in my heart I fear me that battle is hard at hand:<BR>

It is ill in battle the nearest to Marko, the Prince, to stand,&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The tsar looked in all quarters another man to see,<BR>

But nearer to Prince Marko there was no man than he;<BR>

Nearest was the Tsar Suleym&aacute;n. He drew back in the hall,<BR>

But Marko followed onward, and drove him to the wall,<BR>

From his pouch drew Tsar Suleym&aacute;n an hundred ducats fine,<BR>

And gave them to Marko, saying: &#8220;Marko, go drink the wine.&#8221;<BR>
