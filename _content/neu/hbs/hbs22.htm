<H2 ALIGN="center">PRINCE MARKO AND THE SWORD OF VUK&Aacute;SHIN</H2>

T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> sultan with an army is come to K&oacute;sovo;<BR>

An hundred thousand men had he where S&iacute;tnitsa doth flow.<BR>

With a saber of Damascus his herald goeth forth,<BR>

And full three hundred ducats the naked blade is worth;<BR>

And likewise was the scabbard worth ducats fifteen score,<BR>

And the cost of the cord of the scabbard three hundred ducats more.<BR>

No one was found for money to buy that scimitar,<BR>

But chance brought the Prince Marko on the herald of the tsar.<BR>

Said Marko: &#8220;The Damascus blade, thou herald, show to me.&#8221;<BR>

The herald heard and gave over the blade, but not a word said he.<BR>

Marko said to the herald, as he looked on the saber cold:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Forty-five score of ducats will I give thee of yellow gold;<BR>

But harken, herald, let us go to some safe place hereabout,<BR>

That I may count before thee the yellow ducats out,<BR>

For I would not ungird me of the three gold belts this tide,<BR>

Since I am much in the Turkish debt in the camp on every side,<BR>

<P>

And I deem that for the saber they will not let me pay.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The Turk would hardly await him, and hastened on the way,<BR>

And along the water of S&iacute;tnitsa they speedily are gone.<BR>

Prince Marko there ungirded him &#8217;neath the white bridge of stone;<BR>

He spread a mantle of the green, he took the belts of gold,<BR>

And out he shook the golden belts while the Turk the ducats told.<BR>

Marko looked on the saber, and saw thereon displayed<BR>

Three Christian words engraven upon the shining blade;<BR>

And first &#8220;The Saint Demetrius,&#8221; and next &#8220;The Archangel&#8221; came,<BR>

And last of all upon the blade stood King Vuk&aacute;shin&#8217;s name.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Marko saw and forthwith spake:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;O herald of the tsar,</TD></TR></TABLE>

By the one God I adjure thee; whence came the scimitar?<BR>

Was it left by thy father? Did thy wife bring it to thee?<BR>

Or was it won in battle, perchance, from an enemy?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The Turk spake unto Marko:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;By God, thou chief unknown,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Unto thee now the inward of this matter will I own.<BR>

It was not left by my father, my wife brought it not to me;<BR>

But, chief unknown, I won it from a single enemy.<BR>

When with the Servian empire fell both tsars at K&oacute;sovo,<BR>

Murad and Lazar, then I won the saber from the foe.<BR>

Early to water my fat steed to S&iacute;tnitsa I went,<BR>

And there my fortune brought me to a green silken tent.<BR>

Within was a wounded warrior most fierce&#8212;God strike him dead!&#8212;<BR>

The black beard of his lip that tide over his breast it spread.<BR>

He wore a great green mantle, and by him lay the sword.<BR>

When the wounded one beheld me, by God he me implored:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Brother, thou champion unknown, now smite not off mine head;<BR>

Soon will my soul go from me, for my wounds are deep and dread.<BR>

Wait half an hour; by S&iacute;tnitsa there shalt thou set my grave.<BR>

Three belts of gold are on me, and a Damascus glaive<BR>

That is worth a thousand ducats, and here is my silken tent.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;But I would not harken his prayer, and out with him I went,<BR>

Dragging the wounded hero. My saber then I drew,<BR>

And cut off his head; his leg I grasped, and his arm, and straightway threw<BR>

The hero into S&iacute;tnitsa, where swiftly the waters run.<BR>

There with the marvelous booty this saber for thee I won.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the Prince Marko heard it, to the herald did he say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O herald of the Turkish tsar, may God reward thee this day!<BR>

That was my own dear father, even Vuk&aacute;shin, the king.<BR>

Hadst thou waited his soul&#8217;s departure, it had been a better thing,<BR>

And thou, O Turkish herald, wouldst have had a better grave.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;He drew, and cut the Turk&#8217;s head off with the Damascus glaive.<BR>

He grasped the milk-white hand and leg, and in S&iacute;tnitsa he threw<BR>

The herald of the tsar and said: &#8220;Go thou my father unto!&#8221;<BR>

To the army Marko wended with the gold and the scimitar;<BR>

Said the janissaries: &#8220;Prithee, where is the herald of the tsar?&#8221;<BR>

But to them said Marko: &#8220;I pray you, janissaries, begone!<BR>

He took his ducats and pennies to the sea to trade thereon.&#8221;<BR>

Said the Turks one to the other: &#8220;Hard must the Moslem strive,<BR>

Who cometh to Prince Marko a bargain with him to drive!&#8221;<BR>
