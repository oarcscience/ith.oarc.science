<H2 ALIGN="center">THE MIRACLE OF ST. NICHOLAS</H2>

D<SMALL>EAR</SMALL> God, great marvel is it unseen wonders to behold!<BR>

In St. Paul&#8217;s white monastery were tables of the gold,<BR>

And all the saints in order were seated. At the head<BR>

Was the Thunderer Elijah; where the midst of the board was spread,<BR>

Were M&aacute;riya and Sava; at the bottom of the board<BR>

Were Holy Friday and Sunday. To the glory of Christ the Lord<BR>

To drink, and begin the festival, St. Nicholas stood up,<BR>

But he fell asleep in a little and in slumber dropped the cup.<BR>

It fell on the golden table, but broke not, nor spilled the wine.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Elijah then rebuked him:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Nicholas, brother mine,</TD></TR></TABLE>

We have not slumbered, brother, though we drank cool wine ere now,<BR>

Nor dropped cups from our fingers. Why dost thou slumber so?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said St. Nicholas:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Elijah the Thunderer, let be!</TD></TR></TABLE>

I closed my eyes for a little and a strange dream came to me.<BR>

There were three hundred c&aacute;loyers<A NAME="page_259_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_259_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> set sail on the blue sea,<BR>

And they bore sacrificial gifts to the famous Holy Height<BR>

Of Athos; yellow wax they bore and also incense white.<BR>

The wind arose among the clouds; the waves of the sea it smote,<BR>

To drown three hundred c&aacute;loyers. But they cried as from one throat:<BR>

&#8216;Aid us, God and St. Nicholas! Come, wherever thou mayst be!&#8217;<BR>

And I aided them and the c&aacute;loyers came home again from sea;<BR>

Safe home came the three hundred, and O their hearts were light!<BR>

They bore the sacrificial gifts unto the Holy Height<BR>

Of Athos; yellow wax they bore and white incense as well.<BR>

At that time did I slumber, and the cup from my fingers fell.&#8221;<BR>
