<H2 ALIGN="center">PREDRAG AND NENAD</H2>

A <SMALL>MOTHER</SMALL> reared two tender sons, in a hungry time and year,<BR>

At her left and right. And Predrag, that is to say, &#8220;Most Dear,&#8221;<BR>

She named the first with a fair name; also the second son<BR>

Nenad she named, that is to say, &#8220;the Sudden, Unlooked-for one.&#8221;<BR>

Predrag grew strong to wield the spear and the steed to ride upon:<BR>

He ran away from his mother; unto the wood he sped,<BR>

To the hayduks and the outlaws. Nenad his mother bred;<BR>

Nenad forgot his brother, nor pondered him upon.<BR>

Nenad grew strong to wield the spear and the steed to ride upon:<BR>

He ran away from his mother; unto the wood he sped,<BR>

To the hayduks and the outlaws. Three years that life he led.<BR>

He was a hero fortunate and lucky amid the spears;<BR>

His comrades made him their captain; he was their chief three years.<BR>

But woe was him for his mother; to his comrades all he spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Comrades,&#8221; said he, &#8220;now woe is me for my dear mother&#8217;s sake!<BR>

<P>

Let us divide our treasures and go to our mothers dear.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Gladly his comrades thereunto harkened and gave an ear.<BR>

When they took out their treasures, each man a great oath sware,<BR>

For one sware by his brother and one by his sister fair.<BR>

But when Nenad took his treasure, he spake to his comrades by:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Comrades, my brothers, brother nor sister at all have I;<BR>

But&#8212;so may the one God hear me!&#8212;may this arm be withered and lean,<BR>

May the mane of the stallion fall, may rust devour the saber keen,<BR>

If any of the treasure I have kept from other men!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When they had divided the treasure, he mounted his charger then,<BR>

The little and the nimble; to his mother forth he went,<BR>

And well did she receive him, and they feasted in content.<BR>

When they sat down at dinner, said Nenad to the dame:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My gentle mother, surely before all men is it shame!<BR>

I would say thou wert not my mother, &#8217;fore God were it not a sin.<BR>

Why didst thou bear me no brother, or sister of my kin?<BR>

<P>

When my comrades divided the treasure, each man among them sware<BR>

A great oath, by his brother or by his sister fair;<BR>

But, mother, by myself I sware, and my weapons fair to see,<BR>

And also in that hour by the good horse under me.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Speak not foolishly, Nenad!&#8221; his mother laughed in his face;<BR>

&#8220;A brother indeed, and one &#8216;Most Dear,&#8217; have I borne unto thy race.<BR>

But yesterday did I hear of him; with the hayduks he abides<BR>

In the wood of G&aacute;revitsa, and chief of them all he rides.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said Nenad:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Mother, now make me new raiment of the green;</TD></TR></TABLE>

Short shalt thou make it, fitting in the forest to be seen,<BR>

That forth in the wood to find him in this hour I may go,<BR>

And that thus may pass from my spirit the weight of living woe.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;His mother dear bespake him: &#8220;Speak not like a fool,&#8221; said she;<BR>

&#8220;Nenad, my son, in very truth thou wilt perish miserably.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But Nenad heard not his mother, nor would harken what she said;<BR>

Whate&#8217;er was pleasing in his sight, he did that thing instead.<BR>

He made himself new raiment; he wrought it of the green;<BR>

And short he made it, fitting in the forest to be seen.<BR>

He mounted the steed; to his brother through the forest did he go,<BR>

That thereby might pass from him his weight of living woe.<BR>

He made no sound, he spat not, to the steed he spake not at all;<BR>

When to G&aacute;revitsa wood he came, like a gray hawk did he call:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Green wood of G&aacute;revitsa, holdest thou hidden in thee;<BR>

The &#8216;Most Dear,&#8217; my true brother?&#8212;My mother&#8217;s son is he!<BR>

Keepest thou not the hero that will bring my brother to me?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8217;Neath a green fir sat Predrag and drank the yellow wine.<BR>

When he heard the voice, he spake to his men: &#8220;Ho, comrades good of mine!<BR>

Go forth to the road in ambush; for the champion unknown<BR>

Ye shall wait; ye shall not rob him, nor shall ye strike him down:<BR>

Bring him alive to me, hither. Whate&#8217;er his lineage shows,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>He is kin to me.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>And thereupon full thirty lads arose.</TD></TR></TABLE>

In three places were they ambushed, in every place ten men;<BR>

But none dared go before him, when he came to the tirst ten,<BR>

To seize his steed; and forthwith they shot against him then.<BR>

Nenad spake &#8217;mid the arrows: &#8220;Wood-brethren, shoot me not,<BR>

Lest woe for a brother smite you, such as drove me to this spot.&#8221;<BR>

The outlaws of the ambush, in peace they let him past.<BR>

When he came on to the second ten, the shafts flew fierce and fast.<BR>

Said Nenad &#8217;mid the arrows: &#8220;Wood-brethren, shoot me not,<BR>

Lest woe for a brother smite you, such as drove me to this spot,<BR>

For sorrow of him hath smitten me.&#8221; In peace they let him past.<BR>

When he came to the third ambush, the shafts flew fierce and fast.<BR>

Then Nenad the young was angry; he smote the thirty then.<BR>

With the edges of the saber he smote on the first ten;<BR>

The second ten he trampled with the stallion as he could;<BR>

And the third ten he scattered in his anger through the wood,<BR>

Some of them in the forest, and some beside the flood.<BR>

&#8195;One shouted unto Predrag: &#8220;A plague on thee alight!<BR>

A hero unknown in the forest hath slain thy friends in fight.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;To his nimble feet leaped Predrag; he took his arrows and bow;<BR>

Down to the road to the ambush behind a fir did he go.<BR>

With an arrow from the stallion he smote down Nenad the young.<BR>

In the heart was he hit; he shrieked like a hawk; to the saddlebow he clung,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Crying:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Hero of the green wood, may thy right hand wither and dry!</TD></TR></TABLE>

God slay thee alive and the right hand the arrow that let fly.<BR>

May thy right eye be blasted wherewith thou hast looked on me!<BR>

May woe for a brother smite thee, as erst it smote on me,<BR>

Which drove me wretchedly hither, in evil luck to die!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When Predrag heard, he questioned from the fir tree on high:<BR>

&#8220;Who art thou, wounded hero, and of what race art thou?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Said Nenad:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Foh! and wherefore thereof dost thou question now?</TD></TR></TABLE>

Dost thou seek a maiden in marriage? In faith I will give thee none!<BR>

<P>

I am the hero Nenad, and my mother liveth alone,<BR>

And I have but one born brother, a brother born &#8216;Most Dear,&#8217;<BR>

And in a bitter hour I sought to find him here,<BR>

That thereby at last should pass away the weight of my living woe;<BR>

And I came on evil fortune and life&#8217;s very overthrow.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Predrag heard, and let fall the shafts; in bitter terror he was;<BR>

He ran to the wounded hero and laid him on the grass:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Is it thou, my brother Nenad? I am Predrag, thy brother dear.<BR>

Canst thou mend of the wound? My raiment I will rend in pieces here,<BR>

And heal thee well, and bandage thee with the strips of linen fine.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;And the wounded Nenad answered:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Is it thou, brother mine?</TD></TR></TABLE>

Glory to God the highest, that I have looked on thee.<BR>

The burden of my living woe is passed away from me.<BR>

I cannot mend, but of my hurt bloodguiltless mayst thou be!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;So Nenad spake, and thereupon forth his strong spirit went,<BR>

And Predrag lifted up his voice with a miserable lament:<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 248------------------------>

<A NAME="page_248"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 248</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;&#8220;Ah, Nenad, my fair splendid sun, early for me didst thou rise,<BR>

And early set! Ah, basil flower of my green paradise,<BR>

Early didst thou bloom, and early didst thou wither here for me!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;From the scabbard at his girdle he wrenched the poniard free;<BR>

Right through his heart he plunged it. The blood ran swift and red;<BR>

Down brother fell by brother: the dead lay with the dead.<BR>
