# СЛОВО О ПЪЛКУ ИГОРЕВѢ ИГОРЯ СВЯТЪСЛАВЛИЧА ВНУКА ОЛЬГОВА.

# THE TALE OF THE ARMAMENT OF ÍGOŔ, ÍGOŔ SVYATOSLÁVIČ THE GRANDSON OF OLÉG.

The text is based on Pekárski's Екатерининскій Списокъ as emended by
Simoni. The two texts are called Е and С: variants in the printed text
of 1800 of Musin-Puškin being designated as П.

The lines and divisions of the text are the editor's: the original
manuscript having been unpunctuated, unparagraphed and with the words
unintervalled.

Emendations of the text are marked by italicized type.

The notes (with reference to the lines) are in the order of the
*Russian* alphabet for easy reference: the words annotated have a little
'n' after them: where an emendation has been made, the word is to be
found under the *original* form as stated in the variants.
