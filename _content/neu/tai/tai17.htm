</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">&sect; 12. THE SUCCESSORS OF VLAD&Iacute;MIR II.</h3>  
<p>The history of Russia after 1126 down to the Mongol conquest 1240 is a welter of civil wars, nomad incursions, incapable and selfish rulers, increasing disunion; and under such adverse conditions the country was progressively impoverished. In forty four years eighteen princes sat on the throne of K&iacute;ev, i.e. up to the sack of K&iacute;ev by the Northern federation. It is better to survey the course of this long senescence and pass over the particular symptoms.</p>

<p>The short reign of Mst&iacute;slav I (1125-1132) is principally notable for the reoccupation of the principality of Polotsk, the princes of which were banished to Greece for their evil customs [&#1047;&#1083;&#1086;&#1085;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1074;&#1110;&#1077;]. After Vs&eacute;slav's death subdivision and anarchy ensued, and the Polotsk princes, barbarous beyond the conventions of the time, used to sell their own subjects into slavery. Izyasl&aacute;v Vlad&iacute;mirovi&#269; was temporarily installed at Polotsk. [C.f. 1.534 of the text].</p>  
<p>Yarop&oacute;lk II, his brother (1132-1139) arranged that his nephew Izyasl&ucirc;v Mstislavi&#269; should succeed him at K&iacute;ev, thus abrogating the rights of the surviving sons of Vlad&iacute;mir II. Vs&eacute;volod &Oacute;lgovi&#269; interposed; (the house of &#268;ern&iacute;gov was glad of the broils of the Monom&aacute;khovi&#269;i). Y&uacute;ri of S&uacute;zdal, the founder of the Northern house of the Tsars of Moscow, claimed K&iacute;ev, and for three years 1154-1157 was Grand-Prince; meantime civil strife was incessant, in the course of which the &Oacute;lgovi&#269; Vs&eacute;volod II usurped the throne from 1139-1146.</p>  
<p>Y&uacute;ri of Suzdal was a hard calculating character, unscrupulous with the coldness that distinguishes the Northern princes of Suzdal and Vlad&iacute;mir from their Southern predecessors. The Princes of Smol&eacute;nsk, &#268;ern&iacute;gov and Volhynia rose against his rule in the year of his death 1157.</p>  
<p>From this date down to 1240, when the Tatars sacked K&iacute;ev, no less than thirty princes held the perilous throne of K&iacute;ev, a title soon to be devoid of honour or significance.</p>
