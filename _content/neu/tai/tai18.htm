</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">&sect; 13. THE FALL OF KIEV AND RISE OF SUZDAL AND MOSCOW.</h3>  
<p>The confused history of this epoch is clearest surveyed from its centre, which had moved up North.</p>  
<p>South Russia was exhausting itself. From the year 1054 the P&oacute;lovtsy had been ravaging and laying waste, carrying off with them Russians as slaves and creating utter insecurity, poignantly described in the Chronicles for 1170. "God put a good thought into the heart of Mst&iacute;slav Izyasl&aacute;vi&#269; on behalf of the Russian land; for he wished her well with all his heart; so he summoned his brothers, and took counsel with them, saying;--'Brothers, have compassion on the Russian land, and for your own ancestral estates; for the enemy every year carry away the peasants [or the Christians] in their tents; they cut down our forests, and always march over us; and already they will soon cut us off from the road to Greece to Salonica. . . .'"; or again (1103) "In the spring the serf [&#1089;&#1084;&#1077;&#1088;&#1076;&#1098;] sets out to plough with his horses, and the Polov&#269;&iacute;n arrives, strikes him down with his arrow, takes his horse, then goes into his village, seizes his wife, his children and all of his possessions, and burns the empty hut."</p>  
<p>After 1126 the evil went on unabated. Some of the Polovsk campaigns should be outlined. In 1128 they were active under a leader Seluk, a very Turkish name. In 1135, 1139, the &Oacute;lgovi&#269;i are in alliance with the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>P&oacute;lovtsy. In 1140 the P&oacute;lovtsy were beaten and pursued beyond the Don and Volga. In 1150 they are in alliance with Y&uacute;ri of Suzdal. In 1152, 1154 they reappear in the heart of Russia, in 1155 on the Kanina river (near K&iacute;ev), and there is another great battle in 1160.</p>  
<p>After 1160 there is frequent mention of the wild P&oacute;lovtsy,: the implication seems to be that some of them had been settled on Russian territory, and used as auxiliaries by the territorial princes. Thus in 1172, when Gl&#277;b Y&uacute;revi&#269; of Suzdal was on the throne of K&iacute;ev, a host of P&oacute;lovtsy invaded, and divided into two sections; one proceeding to Perey&aacute;slavl&#8217;, the other going down the Dn&#277;pr to Kors&uacute;n; both sent envoys to Gl&#277;b to say that God had established him in his ancestral estate at K&iacute;ev, and they wished to settle amongst the Russians who need fear nothing from them. Terms were arranged with the first section, but not with the second.</p>  
<p>In 1161, 1162, 1165, 1167 (when the Polovsk leader was Bony&aacute;k), 1168, this endless fight continues with the P&oacute;lovtsy; in 1172 Gl&#277;b Y&uacute;revi&#269; is found in alliance with the 'wild' P&oacute;lovtsy, under Konts&aacute;k (or Kon&#269;&aacute;k) against whom &Iacute;go&#341; Svyatosl&aacute;vi&#269;, the hero of the Sl&oacute;vo, made his foray in 1185. In 1173 the relentless nomads ravaged the neighbourhood of K&iacute;ev; but were beaten and pursued as far as the river Bug.</p>  
<p>This list of years and invasions might be prolonged; every year seems the same; the nomads moved forwards with their herds and tents, no doubt themselves shifted from their old pastures by other tribes who urged them from the rear. In 1177 the Russians suffered another great defeat: "God let loose his wrath on us," says the Chronicler in 1177, "and sent the Pagans; but not in compassion for them; but, as manifesting to us, turning us to repentance, that we might be deterred from evil paths. For this is his scourge. . .'--pious reflections, but poor consolation.</p>  
<p>Kon&#269;&aacute;k appears again in 1178, leading the "godless Ishmaelites, the desperate sons of Hagar,"; whilst still the princes bickered and Svyatosl&aacute;v Vs&eacute;volodi&#269; in 1180, Prince of K&iacute;ev, used these foes in his quarrel with the treacherous house of Suzdal which had imprisoned his son Gl&#277;b.</p>  
<p>Meanwhile the princes of Suzdal were gradually conquering the Bolgars of the Volga, a tribe which had almost settled into civic ways.</p>  
<p>In 1184 Svyatosl&aacute;v Vs&eacute;volodovi&#269; defeated the Polovsk chieftain Koby&aacute;k, an incident mentioned in the Sl&oacute;vo l. 344. But in that same year Konts&aacute;k, "the desperate and godless and thrice-accurs&egrave;d," made a very dangerous inroad, using the 'Greek Fire,' that belched flames out of long heavy tubes. Unfortunately for the P&oacute;lovtsy, their one artificer was captured, and the Russians won a great victory.</p>  
<p>And so the tale of these incursions goes on, until in 1224 the P&oacute;lovtsy disappear from history, wiped out of separate existence by the Tatars, and merged with the subject Russians.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The territory of K&iacute;ev and South Russia was being steadily devastated by these ceaseless incursions of barbarians.</p>  
<p>The population was also changing its character. The endless wars internal and external resulted in great captures of slaves the general impoverishment of the agricultural population was also contributing to the enslavement of the Russian people. The husbandman in this insecurity could not cultivate or pay his debts; as a debtor, he became a &#1079;&#1072;&#1082;&#1091;&#1087;&#1098; or debt-serf, who had to pay in labour what he could not absolve in money; as such, if he ran away or evaded his obligations he lost his freedom altogether. Prosperity was founded on slave-ownership and, at the end there were too few freemen left to fight for national freedom.</p>  
<p>The composition of the population was changing. When the P&oacute;lovtsy subdued the Pe&#269;enegs, the latter were soon absorbed into the mass of the people, and these Asiatics were allowed to settle on Russian soil. The remnants of the Pe&#269;enegs, the Torks, the Ber&eacute;ndi&#269;i, and other similar tribes were collectively called Black-caps [&#1095;&#1077;&#1088;&#1085;&#1099;&#1077; &#1082;&#1083;&#1086;&#1073;&#1091;&#1082;&#1080;] and used as auxiliaries of the Prince of K&iacute;ev. In like manner &#268;ern&iacute;gov&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> and Galicia drew on other barbarian peoples as mercenaries.</p>  
<p>These ruralized Turanians became the natural allies of the Russians in defence of their villages and lands; but these admixtures were altering the composition and so the character of the nation.</p>  
<p>To these disturbing factors may be added the continuous emigration North, to Suzdal, six hundred miles away, where there was something like a settled government, and above all some immunity from nomad incursion. These Turanian invaders seem nearly all to have come from the South, from the shores of the Caspian, North of the Caucasus, and to have advanced by the steppes watered by the Don, the Volga and their affluents. This also was the Tatars' line of advance.</p>  
<p>Thus South Russia, racked with civil war, depleted by emigration, repeopled by Asiatics, ravaged year in, year out, by savage foes, and crippled in her energies by the rapid extention of slave-holding, was exhausted, the wonder is that she kept up the struggle so long, and gave such valiant account of herself at the last hopeless contest with the Mongols.</p>  
<p>Something, even though in outline, must be said of the dynastic changes from 1126, when Vlad&iacute;mir II died, down to the extinction of Russian freedom by the Tatars and the supersession of K&iacute;ev as the seat of the Grand-Prince.</p>  
<p>After the death of Mst&iacute;slav I in 1132, the Monom&aacute;khovici had to contend with the &Oacute;lgovi&#269;i, who aspired to K&iacute;ev; with the rivalry of the descendants of Izyasl&aacute;v II and Rost&iacute;slav I, (i. e. the princes of Volhynia and the princes of Smol&eacute;nsk), as well as with the claims of Suzdal which were governed by the descendants. of Y&uacute;ri Vlad&iacute;mirovi&#269;. On the death</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of Izyasl&aacute;v II, (a prince whom the Chronicle calls honourable, orthodox and pious; he was certainly a brave warrior), Y&uacute;ri from 1154-1157 held the throne of K&iacute;ev, for which he had plotted so long and so indefatigably. The annals from 1157 are mainly occupied with wars with the princes of Galicia, during which Yarosl&aacute;v Vlad&iacute;mirkovi&#269; was creating his immense principality [v. note <i>sub hoc nomine</i>].</p>  
<p>In 1169 Mst&iacute;slav II Izy&aacute;slavi&#269; was on the throne, and allied him self with N&oacute;vgorod in a last attempt to strengthen K&iacute;ev against Suzdal, which under Andr&eacute;y Bogolybhski Y&uacute;revi&#269; (1110-1174) had been steadily growing and consolidating. A great conspiracy was entered into against, K&iacute;ev, amongst others by the princes of Perey&aacute;slavl&#8217;, Smol&eacute;nsk, Dorogobug, Ovruc, Vyseg&oacute;rod, Ol&eacute;g and &Iacute;go&#341; Svyatosl&aacute;vic of the house of &#268;ern&iacute;gov. The expedition was entrusted to Mst&iacute;slav, Andr&eacute;y's son. K&iacute;ev was sacked for two days; "no mercy was shown to anyone; the churches were burnt; the inhabitants slaughtered, the women led into captivity and separated from their husbands; and the children sobbed as they saw their mothers' plight: houses were pillaged: royal robes, icons and books looted; and all the bells were carried away. All men in K&iacute;ev groaned and lamented. All of this was accomplished for our sins."</p>  
<p>Andr&eacute;y Y&uacute;revi&#269; had too mean an opinion of the former capital of Russia to trouble to occupy the throne; at his orders, his son Mst&iacute;slav set up Gl&#283;b Y&uacute;revi&#269; as regent.</p>  
<p>Suzdal had long been virtually independent. It had taken practically no share in the defence of Russia against the P&oacute;lovtsy, and directed its energies to expansion Northwards against the pacific Bolgars of the Volga. Andr&eacute;y, by the brutal sack of K&iacute;ev, turned the current of Russian history. In 1172 Mst&iacute;slav Izyaslavi&#269; with the aid of the Galicians [cf. 1.486 of the text] re-entered K&iacute;ev: and Gl&#283;b, to recover his conquest, utilized the savage P&oacute;lovtsy under Kon&#269;&aacute;k. In 1173 Rom&aacute;n Rost&iacute;slavi&#269; was allowed to take the throne of K&iacute;ev, on the death of Gl&#277;b, whom the Chronicle celebrates as one who loved his brothers, held fast by his oath until death, was gentle, courteous, generous to the church and charitable. This obituary gathers force by comparison with another of 1174, one Vlad&iacute;mir Mst&iacute;slavi&#269; who suffered much evil, fleeing to Galicia, to Hungary or Polovsk-land, for his own fault, that he never was faithful to his pledged word.</p>  
<p>In 1175 the prince of Suzdal already has the title of Grand Prince [&#1074;&#1077;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1110;&#1081; &#1082;&#1085;&#1103;&#1079;&#1100;], whilst the ruler at K&iacute;ev is appointed and deposed at his will, and soon called simply &#1050;&#1085;&#1103;&#1079;&#1100; &#1082;&#1110;&#1077;&#1074;&#1094;&#1082;&#1110;&#1081; like any other local princelet. In 1175 Andr&eacute;y Y&uacute;revi&#269;, the real founder of the northern Russian state, was assassinated. He is duly appraised by the Chronicle for his wisdom and piety, his zeal in building cities, and the greatness of the state he erected. He was born in the North, was cold and calculating, unlike the great princes of K&iacute;evite Russia; but he deserves the lengthy laudation awarded to him by the contemporary Chronicle.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Moscow was founded in 1147, and already appears in 1175 and 1176 as a place of importance. In 1271 it became the capital of Moscovite Russia, replacing Vlad&iacute;mir, [the northern town of that name].</p>  
<p>In 1177 Vs&eacute;volod Y&uacute;revi&#269; succeeded to Andr&eacute;y as virtual autocrat of the independent state of Suzdal. He was the master of Russia, controlled the &Oacute;lgovi&#269;i of &#268;ern&iacute;gov, from whom he took Ryaz&aacute;n, compensating them with the gift of K&iacute;ev. Thus in 1180 Svyatosl&aacute;v Vs&eacute;volodi&#269;, the grandson of Ol&eacute;g of Tmutarak&aacute;&#324; succeeded to the sceptre of Vlad&iacute;mir II.</p>  
<p>From all these causes the centre of gravity of medieval Russia gradually shifted up North; K&iacute;ev was left to decay: to be swept into the subsequent Lithuanian State, and at last to be recovered by Moscow, two hundred and forty years later, together with the Tatar title of Tsar of Russia [&#1062;&#1072;&#1088;&#1100; &#1073;&#1089;&#1077;&#1103; &#1056;&#1086;&#1089;&#1089;&#1110;&#1080;], after the Tatar dominion had been overwhelmed by new Turkish invaders, who swept farther South to uproot the ancient Eastern Empire, and to occupy the impregnable Dardanelles.</p>
