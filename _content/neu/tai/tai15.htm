</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">&sect;10. THE FOUR GREAT PRINCES.</h3>  
<p>In the year 1113 Svyatop&oacute;lk II Izyasl&aacute;vi&#269; died. Like his uncle, Vs&eacute;volod I he had been maintained on the throne by Vlad&iacute;mir.</p>  
<p>The citizens of K&iacute;ev insisted on Vlad&iacute;mir resuming the office of Grand-Prince and passing over the claims of the Svyatosl&aacute;vi&#269;i, the next eldest branch of the Yarosl&aacute;vi&#269;i, whose record had been none of the best during the previous reigns. Svyatop&oacute;lk left no brothers, and his sons were mere lads. Vlad&iacute;mir Monom&aacute;kh [his baptismal name] ascended the throne; by so doing, he incurred the hostility of the envious &Oacute;lgovi&#269;i, who were now sovereigns in the independent domain of &#268;ern&iacute;gov.</p>  
<p>There had, as yet, been three great rulers in K&iacute;evite Russia. The first of these, Svyatosl&aacute;v I, was the great conqueror, a Bayard, who worked with the statesmanlike object of giving his country intelligible frontiers, to protect it against the nomads and secure the trade-routes</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>down the Dn&#283;pr and on the Black Sea. He shattered the Khozars, and shook off the Asiatic yoke. His was a romantic figure that compels admiration.</p>  
<p>The second is his son Vlad&iacute;mir I. His was a passionate and sensuous nature, but his impulsiveness was directed to great ends. He re-created Russian unity; gave Russia a new religious purpose, and, with this end in view, even attempted to formalize and institute Paganism. He ruled with vigour and concentrated authority in his own hands at K&iacute;ev within those huge confines (which Svyatosl&aacute;v could not enlarge).</p>  
<p>After him there came the great administrator and law-giver, Yarosl&aacute;v I. This monarch had less initiative than his father Vlad&iacute;mir; but he was just and strong and did all he could to build enduringly on the foundations laid by Svyatosl&aacute;v and Vlad&iacute;mir. Yarosl&aacute;v I made Russia known to foreign states: one of his daughters married Henry I of France: another, the King of Hungary.</p>  
<p>But the many sons of Yarosl&aacute;v were unequal to the stupendous task of maintaining in unity a realm with no defined boundaries, without even the loose bond of a feudal system, and pertinaciously, relentlessly, attacked by swarms of nomads from the steppes. During the anarchy of the succeeding reigns, the natural lines of fissure asserted themselves and developed; N&oacute;vgorod split off, to enjoy till 1478 (when she was conquered and destroyed by Moscow) virtual independence, electing and rejecting what prince she would: Polotsk parted from Russia; and at last the independence of Smol&eacute;nsk, Volhynia, &#268;ern&iacute;gov and Galicia had to be conceded. The domain of &#268;ern&iacute;gov included Moscow, Ryaz&aacute;&#324;, Vy&aacute;tka and the R&aacute;dimi&#269;i.</p>  
<p>At this point of history, medieval Russia's last great ruler steps in, a man trained to arms, which he had never used except against rebels or the enemy, the faithful lieutenant of his father Vs&eacute;volod I and his cousin Svyatop&oacute;lk II, the statesman who adhered to the rules of succession, imperfect as they were, so as to preserve some safeguard against arbitrary force. The dismemberment of Russia was inevitable: he accepted and tried to rebuild on this assumption. But the dilemma was hopeless. Unless the great estates were made heritable, there would be no stability, and no contentment of princely ambition: if they were made heritable, there could be no concerted common action, save by casual consent. If the old scheme obtained of grants of military posts for life, the holders would be always dissatisfied, and their sons always in rebellion. There was no middle course of feudal vassal tenure with a sovereign overlord.</p>  
<p>To a state racked with anarchy within, with its <A HREF="errata.htm#1"><i>morale</i></A> broken by living precedents of treachery and alliance for selfish ends with the Pagan foe, Vlad&iacute;mir II&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> at last succeeded; he left Russia organized enough for common action, so as to subsist a century longer.</p>
