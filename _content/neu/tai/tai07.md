### §2. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE SLAVS.

The Slavs in the tenth century were organized in clans or tribes
\[племена\]; of these the Полояне settled on the middle of the Dnĕpr,
the Древляне in the forests watered by the Southern affluents of the
Prípet’; to the West of these last-named on the river Bug the Сѣверяне
or Дулѣбы opposite to the Поляне on the Eastern bank of the Dněpr the
Сѣверяне on the Desna and the Sulá; on the Sož (a tributary of the
Dnĕpr) the Радимичи and to the East of the Радимичи on the upper Oka the
Вятичи. The Кривичи settled in the plain where the Dněpr, the Western
Dviná and the Volga meet; and South-West of these last, in the marshy
wooded country on the Western Dviná and Prípet; the Дреговичи, to the
North of the Дреговичи on the Western Dviná a branch of the Кривичи viz.
the Полочане; and lastly on the river Volkov by Lake Ilmen the Словѣне
of Nóvgorod.

The Полине formed the basis of the subsequent principality of Kíev: the
Древляне of that of Pereyáslavl’: the Дулѣбы formed the principality of
Volhynia: the name of the Сѣверяне was perpetuated its the city Nóvgorod
Sĕversky; the Вятичи formed the independent state of Vyátka, whilst the
Полочане under the house of Polotsk were also to establish themselves as
separate entity. The Slavs at Nóvgorod realized the great mercantile
state, whose history was to be so different from that of the rest of
Russia, a free Hanseatic community only suppressed by the Moscovite
rulers in 1478.
