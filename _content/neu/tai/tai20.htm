</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">(3) THE CHRONICLE FOR THE YEAR 1185 TRANSLATED IN FULL.</h3>  
<p>The Chronicle for the year 1185 contains very full details of the events in the Sl&oacute;vo, but it is evident that the poet did not borrow his facts from the sources, as we now have them.</p>  
<p>On the 1st of March 1185 Svyatosl&aacute;v Vs&eacute;volodovi&#269; and Ry&uacute;rik Rost&iacute;slavi&#269; defeated Kon&#269;&aacute;k, and pursued beyond the River Khorol, but did not succeed in tracing or capturing him.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxx"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxx</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Yarosl&aacute;v Vs&eacute;volodovi&#269;, the prince of &#268;ern&iacute;gov, declined to accompany this expedition, contenting himself with sending his man Olstin Oveksi&#269;. &Iacute;go&#341; resented not being invited to take his share in this foray, and without consultation, on Thursday, the 23rd April, went to N&oacute;vgorod S&#277;verski, where he was joined by his brother Vs&eacute;volod of Tr&uacute;be&#269;`, and his nephew Svyatosl&aacute;v &Oacute;lgovi&#269; of Rylsk, and also by his son Vlad&iacute;mir from Put&iacute;vl&#8217;. Yarosl&aacute;v Vlad&iacute;mirkovi&#269;, the ruler of Galicia, and father-in-law of &Iacute;go&#341; was also asked to send contingents, and the &#1050;&#1086;&#1074;&#1091;&#1080; of &#268;ern&iacute;gov [Turanian tribes attached to the Russian princelets] were summoned as auxiliaries.</p>  
<p>With this army, &Iacute;go&#341; set out to the River Don&eacute;ts. "He looked up at the sky and saw the sun standing like the moon, and said to his <i>boy&aacute;rs</i> and <i>drui&#382;na</i>:--'Do ye see what this portent is?' They gazed and saw it and bowed their heads. But the men spoke--'This portent bodes no good!' [The importance attached to astronomical portents in the Chronicles is very great, and every event of the sort is closely and accurately described]. . . . . . . &Iacute;go&#341; forded the Don&eacute;ts and &Iacute;go&#341; marched on to the Oskol and there waited two days for his brother Vs&eacute;volod, who was coming by another road, from Kursk; thence the two proceeded to the River Salnitsa.</p>  
<p>Their scouts advised them--"We have seen the array of your enemies; they advance at evil speed: let us move swiftly, or return home; the time is not our own.' &Iacute;go&#341; spoke with his brothers,--'If we do not fight, but retreat, then our disgrace will be more than death; be it as God will.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And, with this premonition, they marched on all the night through; and on the morning of that Friday, at noon-time they met the army of the P&oacute;lovtsy.</p>  
<p>When they reached the enemy, the Russians left their tents behind them; and the enemy young and old were all standing on the further bank of the River Syuurli. &Iacute;go&#341; ranged his six companies; his own in the middle, Vs&eacute;volod's on the right, that of his nephew Svyatosl&aacute;v on the left; in front of him, his son Vlad&iacute;mir, and a company kept by Yarosl&aacute;v (with Olstin and his Kov&uacute;i), and in front a third regiment of archers drawn from all the princes' troops. This was the order of battle.</p>  
<p>"And &Iacute;go&#341; said to his brothers,--'We have sought this: let us push on!' and so they advanced, putting their hope in God. As they reached the River Syuurli, the archers in the Polovsk host advanced and shot an arrow each at the Russians: and galloped back again. The Russians had not yet crossed the River Syuurli; the Polov&eacute;tski forces, who stood farther from the river also galloped away.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Svyatosl&aacute;v &Oacute;lgovi&#269; and Vlad&iacute;mir &Iacute;go&#341;evi&#269; and Olstin with the Kov&uacute;i and the archers pursued them; but &Iacute;go&#341; and Vs&eacute;volod advanced slowly, keeping their men in hand; but the Russians in the van struck the enemy down and captured them. The P&oacute;lovtsy fled beyond their tents, and the Russians reached the tents and plundered them, whilst others came back to camp at night loaded with booty.</p>  
<p>When all the P&oacute;lovtsy had been gathered together, &Iacute;go&#341; said to his brothers and his men:--"Thus hath God by his might given us victory over our foes and honour and glory to us; we have seen the companies of the P&oacute;lovtsy, how many they are, but have they all yet met? So, if we now march through the night, who will follow us till the morning, will they all follow us? Our best horsemen, may-be, will he cut down and we shall fare as God wills it." Then Svyatosl&aacute;v &Oacute;lgovi&#269; spoke: "I have pursued the P&oacute;lovtsy far, and my horses can do no more; if I now continue, I shall have to fall behind on the march." And Vs&eacute;volod confirmed him in his resolve to stay there.</p>  
<p>&Iacute;go&#341; said: "It is unprofitable, knowing this, brothers, that we should perish thus." So they encamped on the spot.</p>  
<p>When the Saturday dawned, the regiments of the P&oacute;lovtsy came forward, like a forest; the Russian princes were bewildered; whom should they assail first; for the multitude of them was numberless. And &Iacute;go&#341; said:--"Thus we know we have collected against us all the land; Konts&aacute;k and Koz&aacute; Burnovi&#269; and T&oacute;ksobits Kolobi&#269; and Etebe&#269; and Tertrobi&#269;." And, understanding this, they dismounted from their horses, for they wished to fight their way to the River Don&eacute;ts and said: "If we flee, we shall ourselves escape, but we shall desert the Black folk [i.e. the serfs or servants; here the hired soldiers] but in the eyes of God we shall pass bearing the sin for them; so, let us die or remain alive in one place!"</p>  
<p>With these words they all dismounted and set out to the fight; and, by the dispensation of God, &Iacute;go&#341; was wounded in the hand; and his left hand was as though it were dead; and there was great grieving in his host; and his general was taken, after receiving a wound in the front.</p>  
<p>So the fight went on steadily all that day until nightfall, and there were many wounded and dead in the Russian forces; and on the Saturday night they continued fighting.</p>  
<p>The Sunday was dawning, when the Kov&uacute;i became disordered, and fled in panic. &Iacute;go&#341; at that time was on horseback, on account of his wound, and rode to their company, wishing to make them return to the army. Then realizing he had left his own people some way behind, he took his helmet off and galloped back to his regiment, in order that he might be recognised as their prince and they might rally. But none returned, except Mikh&aacute;lko Gy&uacute;rgovi&#269; who recognised his prince and-came back. For the men were not well mingled with the Kov&uacute;i, except a few of the privates or some of the boy&aacute;rs' champions [&#1086;&#1090;&#1088;&#1086;&#1082;&#1098;]. For the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>good men were fighting on foot, and amid them Vs&eacute;volod showed no little valour.</p>  
<p>And as &Iacute;go&#341; was approaching his regiments, [the P&oacute;lovtsy] crossed his way, and took him captive within an arrow's shot from his own men.</p>  
<p>When he was a prisoner, &Iacute;go&#341; saw his brother Vs&eacute;volod fighting stoutly; and, in his soul, he implored his own death, that he might not witness the fall of his own brother. Vs&eacute;volod went on fighting until he had not a weapon left in his hands, and they were fighting round a lake.</p>  
<p>Thus, on Holy Sunday, the Lord poured forth his wrath upon us; and, in the stead of mirth, he gave us wailing, and instead of gladness grief [&#1078;&#1077;&#1083;&#1102;], on the River Kay&aacute;la [now the Kag&aacute;l&#8217;nik; v. note to &#1050;&#1072;&#1103;&#1083;&#1072;]. And &Iacute;go&#341; said:--"I recollect my sins before the Lord my God, that I have wrought many to die, and shed much blood in the Christian land; how I showed no mercy to the Christian folk, and took by storm the city of Gl&#283;bov near Perey&aacute;slavl&#8217;, For there no little evil befell the innocent Christians; fathers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> were parted from their offspring, brother from brother, friend from friend, women from their betrothed and daughters from their mothers, and all was confounded in the captivity and sorrow that then arose; so that the living envied the dead and the dead rejoiced, as holy martyrs who had undergone their trial by fire in this life; old men were swept aside and youths received wounds cruel and ruthless; grown men were hewn and mutilated and the women violated; and all this I have done" &Iacute;go&#341; said "I am unworthy to live, and now I see the vengeance of the Lord my God. Where is now my beloved brother? Where is my brother's son? Where is the son I have born me? Where are the nobles of my Council, where my valiant warriors, the file of my men? Where are my steeds and my priceless muniments? Am I not parted from it all; has not the Lord given me as a captive to these lawless foes?". . . . . . . .</p>  
<p>One of the Targols, a man named &#268;ilbuk had captured &Iacute;go&#341;; Vs&eacute;volod his brother had been taken prisoner by Rom&aacute;n Kzi&#269;, and Svyatosl&aacute;v &Oacute;lgovi&#269; by Elde&#269;yuk of the Vobur&#269;evi&#269;i, and Vlad&iacute;mir by Kopti of the Ula&#353;evi&#269;i.</p>  
<p>On the battlefield then Konts&aacute;k took charge of &Iacute;go&#341;, his kinsman [&#1089;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#1098;], as he was wounded. . . . . . . .</p>  
<p>Out of the many captives few could escape; for it was impossible for those who ran away to evade because they were encompassed by the powerful armies of the P&oacute;lovtsy as though by stout walls. About fifteen of the Russians escaped, and fewer of the Kov&uacute;i, the rest were drowned in the sea [i.e. the river].</p>  
<p>At this time the Grand-Prince Svyatosl&aacute;v Vs&eacute;volodovi&#269; had gone to Kor&aacute;&#269;ev and was collecting an army from the Uplands, wishing to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>march against the P&oacute;lovtsy on the River Don all the summer. Svyatosl&aacute;v on his return, was at N&oacute;vgorod-S&#277;verski when he heard of his brothers; how they had marched against the P&oacute;lovtsy, and concealed their movements from him; and he was displeased at the news.</p>  
<p>Svyatosl&aacute;v was travelling and when he arrived at &#268;ern&iacute;gov, B&#283;loyolod Pros&oacute;vi&#269; came and told him what had happened with the P&oacute;lovtsy. When Svyatosl&aacute;v heard of it, he heaved a sigh and wiped his tears and said:--"Oh my beloved brethren and sons and men in the Russian Land! Would that God had allowed me to conquer the Pagans: but, not casting away their youthfulness, they have opened wide the gates to the Russian land [&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1086;&#1090;&#1072; &#1085;&#1072; &#1056;&#1091;&#1089;&#1100;&#1089;&#1082;&#1091;&#1102; &#1079;&#1077;&#1084;&#1083;&#1102;]". . . . .</p>  
<p>Svyatosl&aacute;v sent his son Ol&eacute;g, and Vlad&iacute;mir [Gl&#283;bovi&#269;] into the Pos&eacute;mye&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A>: and hearing the news, the cities of the Pos&eacute;mye were stricken and there was grief and bitter wailing, such as had never been in the Pos&eacute;mye or in N&oacute;vgorod-S&#283;verski or in all the domain of &#268;ern&iacute;gov. . . .</p>  
<p>Svyatosl&aacute;v sent for help to David Rost&iacute;slavi&#269; of Smol&eacute;nsk, and there arrived other help, but Yarosl&aacute;v [of &#268;ern&iacute;gov] collected troops at &#268;ern&iacute;gov.</p>  
<p>But the Pagan P&oacute;lovtsy having conquered &Iacute;go&#341; and his brothers were seized with great pride and gathered all their tribes [&#1103;&#1079;&#1099;&#1082;&#1098;] on to Russian soil. Strife ensued amongst them; for Kon&#269;&aacute;k said:--"Let us go to the K&iacute;ev country where our brothers and our Grand-Prince Bony&aacute;k were defeated" [i.e. in the year 1185&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A>]; whereas Kza spoke:--"Let us go by the River Se&#301;m where their wives and children are left, a ready booty for us; for we shall capture the cities, without incurring risks" and so they parted their armies into two. . . . . . . .</p>  
<p>Kon&#269;&aacute;k proceeded to Perey&aacute;slavl&#8217;, which was defended by Vlad&iacute;mir Gl&#277;bovi&#269;; this prince was himself wounded in a sally from the walls. Vlad&iacute;mir Gl&#283;bovi&#269; sent word to Svyatosl&aacute;v, Ry&uacute;rik and David, and the relief was despatched.</p>  
<p>But the P&oacute;lovtsy hearing of this, retired from Perey&aacute;slavl&#8217; and on their way attacked Rimov [<i>or</i> perhaps <i>Rim</i>]. But the men of Rim shut themselves up in their city, and climbing up to the ramparts, when, by Divine judgment, two defences fell down with the men, into the enemy, and the rest of the citizens were overcome with panic. Some citizens quitted the town and fought as they betook themselves into the Rimov swamps and thus escaped capture; those who lingered in the town were all taken prisoners.</p>  
<p>. . . The P&oacute;lovtsy, after capturing Rimov, looted it and went on their ways. But the Russian princes returned home, and were sorrowful. . .</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>But the other P&oacute;lovtsy went by another road to Put&iacute;vl&#8217;. Kza had a powerful army: and they waged war in their districts and burned the castle at Put&iacute;vl&#8217; and then returned home again.</p>  
<p>But &Iacute;go&#341; Svyatosl&aacute;vi that year remained among the P&oacute;lovtsy and said:--"I, fitly with my merit, have received defeat at Thy command. . . . . . . ." The P&oacute;lovtsy showed awe for his generalship and did him no offence; but set to guard him fifteen men from out of their sons and five from their chieftains' sons, in all twenty. And they gave him freedom to betake himself where he would, and he went hunting with his sparrow-hawk, five or six of his servants accompanying him. His guards obeyed him and honoured him, and wherever he sent anyone, willingly that one did his bidding.</p>  
<p>He had also brought a priest with him from Russia for the Holy Office; for he knew not the will of God and was readying himself to stay there a long time.</p>  
<p>But the Lord rescued him for the prayers of the Christians, many of whom grieved for him and shed tears for him.</p>  
<p>Whilst he was there among the P&oacute;lovtsy, a man by birth a Polov&#269;&iacute;n, named L&aacute;vor, had found his way there; he had a goodly thought and said:--"I will go with thee to Russia." But &Iacute;go&#341; at first gave him no confidence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> but held to the lofty reasoning of youth,--and did not intend taking the man and fleeing with him to Russia,------: and he said:--"For the sake of glory I did not run away from the <i>dru&#382;&iacute;na</i> before, and now I will not depart by a dishonourable road." With &Iacute;go&#341; there was the son of the thousandman and his groom and they persuaded him and said:--"Prince, go back to Russia, if God desires to rescue thee." But such an occasion came to point as &Iacute;go&#341; sought for himself. But, as we said before, the P&oacute;lovtsy were returning from Perey&aacute;slavl&#8217;; so &Iacute;go&#341;'s counsellors said to him:--"Thou cherishest a haughty thought within thee and one mispleasing to God; thou seekest to take this man and to flee to Russia; but of this thou dost not take heed, that the P&oacute;lovtsy will be returning from the war; and we have heard this that our princes have been beaten by them, that they will slay the prince and you and all of Russia. Then thou wilt have neither fame nor life!"</p>  
<p>Prince &Iacute;go&#341; took this word to his heart, for he was afraid of their return and he tried to flee. He considered were it better for him to flee by day or night. It was not possible for him to escape by day or night: for his guards watched him; but he secured a suitable time at sunset.</p>  
<p>So &Iacute;go&#341;' sent to L&aacute;vor his groom, and told him:--"Cross to the farther bank of the river Tor with a led horse," for he had decided to escape to Russia with L&aacute;vor.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>At this time the P&oacute;lovtsy were drinking <i>kumys</i> and evening was approaching; the groom came to &Iacute;go&#341; his prince and acquainted him that L&aacute;vor was waiting for him.</p>  
<p>&Iacute;go&#341; got up in terror and trembling, and bowed low to the Divine image and the venerable cross and prayed;--"Lord of Mercy. . . . . . ."</p>  
<p>The guards were playing and making merry, and thought the Prince was asleep. The Prince advanced to the river and forded it, mounted his horse and thus passed through their tents.</p>  
<p>This rescue the Lord wrought on Friday evening. &Iacute;go&#341; then walked a-foot eleven days to the town of Don&eacute;ts and thence to his own N&oacute;vgorod; and they rejoiced to see him; from N&oacute;vgorod he went to his brother Yarosl&aacute;v at &#268;ern&iacute;gov to ask for help in the Pos&eacute;mye. He travelled thence to K&iacute;ev to the Grand-Prince Svyatosl&aacute;v and Svyatosl&aacute;v was glad to see him, as was also R&uacute;rik."</p>  
<p>From the Lavrent&iacute;ski MS. the following supplementary facts can be taken; as almost always, this text is much terser and less detailed.</p>  
<p>"This year the grandsons of Ol&eacute;g decided to march against the P&oacute;lovtsy, because they had not gone that year with the rest of the princes. They went by themselves, saying,--"Are we not princes too? So we too shall gain ourselves renown."</p>  
<p>&Iacute;go&#341; with two of his sons from N&oacute;vgorod-S&#283;verski set out from Perey&aacute;slavl&#8217;, and his brother Vs&eacute;volod from Tr&uacute;be&#269;, and Svyatosl&aacute;v &Oacute;lgovi&#269; from Rylsk and the &#268;ern&iacute;gov mercenaries joined them.</p>  
<p>The Chronicle proceeds to tell how at the three days' battle &Iacute;go&#341;'s army suffered through lack of water, and the two following phrases occur, which recall passages in the Sl&oacute;vo.</p>  
<p>"Where he had had joy, now we had discouragement, and wailing spread afar . . . . . and there was wailing and groaning." [&#1043;&#1076;&#1123; &#1073;&#1086; &#1073;&#1103;&#1096;&#1077; &#1073;&#1098; &#1085;&#1072;&#1089;&#1098; &#1088;&#1072;&#1076;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1100;, &#1085;&#1099;&#1085;&#1123; &#1078;&#1077; &#1074;&#1098;&#1079;&#1076;&#1099;&#1093;&#1072;&#1085;&#1100;&#1077; &#1080; &#1087;&#1083;&#1072;&#1095;&#1100; &#1088;&#1072;&#1089;&#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1090;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1089;&#1103; . . . &#1080; &#1073;&#1099;&#1089;&#1090;&#1098; &#1087;&#1083;&#1072;&#1095;&#1100; &#1080; &#1089;&#1090;&#1077;&#1085;&#1072;&#1085;&#1110;&#1077;].</p>
