### (23) HALLOWEEN.

Hallow Even is the vigil of All Saints' Day, which is on the first of
November. Christian history presents a curious divergence of custom in
regard to this Church festival; for whilst in Catholic countries the

faithful turn their steps to the churchyard and place flowers on the
graves of the departed, the Protestant section, and that portion of the
community known as worldly people, celebrate the occasion by making
merry and using various means to peer into the future. All Saints' Day
being originally a day for remembering the souls of the departed, it is
confessedly difficult to trace any connection between a pious
instruction on the part of the Church, and the old (and modern) practice
of unmarried women, who use this day--or eve--to divine their
matrimonial bliss, or misery. But as with so many Church festivals the
jollity and the seriousness often went together, or the directly
religious act preceded the merry-making; and in the course of time the
religious element grew weaker, whilst the secular element retained more
or less its vitality. Anyhow in the North of England the sanctity of
Hallow Even became transmogrified into "Nut Crack Night." Girls anxious,
or, shall I say, curious, to know the name of their husbands, would
place two nuts in the fire side by side, giving them names. If the fire
caused the nuts to burst and fly apart, the sign was distinctly bad; if
they burned together, the omen was decidedly good. Gay in his Spell thus
refers to the custom :-

"Two hazel nuts I threw into the flame,  
And to each nut I gave a sweetheart's name:  
This with the loudest bounce me sore amaz'd,  
That in a flame of brightest colour blaz'd;  
As blaz'd the nut, so may thy passion grow,  
For 'twas thy Nut that did so brightly glow!"

"In marriage ceremonies among the Romans the bridegroom threw nuts about
the room for the boys

to scramble. The epithalamiums of the classics confirm this, and Horace
speaks of the use of nuts in sports. They were not excluded from the
catalogue of superstitions under Papal Rome. Thus on the 10th of August
in the Romish ancient Calendar I find it observed that some religious
use was made of them, and that they were in great estimation: Nuces in
pretio et religiosae."
