### (24) THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER.

It is instructive to note how little influence the origin of this
celebration has on the observance of the custom. There is no question of
Roman Catholicism versus Protestantism; no preaching in churches against
the papists; no defiance of Protestant practice. Gunpowder Plot is an
item familiar to every schoolboy who has read his history-book, but the
religious significance is a mere nothing compared with the fun of firing
off fireworks. And I question whether even that will last another
century; for whereas once--not thirty years ago--every part of the
countryside would be alight with huge fires, one can now only note their
slow decay; and the sale of fireworks is not on the increase. Perhaps it
is just as well. If the function is religious, it should be religiously
observed; if not, let it become what it has become--the one day in the
year when we agree to let off our squibs and crackers. "The search for
Guy Fawkes" is still kept up as a formal custom.
