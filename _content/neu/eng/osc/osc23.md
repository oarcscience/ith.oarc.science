### (20) LICHFIELD GREENHILL BOWER.

In the early days of England, when the nation was being organised for
defence, it was incumbent upon every town and village to hold an annual
meeting to consider the defence of the country against "all foreigners
and enemies." This regulation is maintained in the Laws of Edward the
Confessor. Other and later acts specify what the town must provide by
way of the implements of war. Of course these duties now devolve upon a
government department, but at Lichfield, in June, the city still holds
its annual meeting, and boys are paraded, wearing the suits of armour
provided for defence against the invasion of Germany! The function is
carried out with dignity, as becomes the remembrance of an old custom,
but when it is over the day is given up to jollity of the true English
type.
