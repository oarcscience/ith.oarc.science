### (3) WEDDING RINGS AND BRIDE CAKE.

If a child were to ask its mother who wore the first wedding ring, and
the mother were to pass the question on to the historian of social
customs, the historian would have to confess not only that he did not
know, but that it would be impossible to assign even an approximate date
when such rings became a feature in social life. We know from Juvenal
(Satire vi.) that the Romans used such rings; we know that the Greeks
used them as far back as we can trace; they are found in Egyptian tombs;
they appear to have been part of the customs of the earliest
civilisations we can trace. It was this "Heathen" origin of the wedding
ring which well nigh caused the abolition of it during the time of the
Commonwealth.

The facetious author of Hudibras gives us the following chief reasons
why the Puritans wished it to be set aside:--

"Others were for abolishing  
That tool of matrimony, a ring,  
With which the unsanctify'd bridegroom  
Is marry'd only to a Thumb,  
(As wise as ringing of a pig  
That us'd to break up ground and dig)  
The Bride to nothing but her will,  
That nulls the After-Marriage still."

The ring is essentially emblematic, a point which is quaintly stated by
Swinburne in his Treatise of Spousals. "The first inventor of the ring,
as is reported \[he cites Alberic de Rosa in suo Dictionar. v.
Annulus\], was one Prometheus. The workman which made it was Tubal-Cain:
and Tubal-Cain, by the counsel of our first parent, Adam, gave it unto
his Son to this end, that therewith he should espouse a Wife, like as
Abraham delivered unto his servants bracelets and earrings of gold. The
form of the Ring being circular, that is round and without end,
importeth thus much, that their mutual love and hearty affection should
roundly flow from the one to the other as in a Circle, and that
continually and for ever."

History records variations in the use of certain fingers for wearing the
ring. The Hereford, York, and Salisbury missals direct the ring to be
placed on the thumb first of all; then on the second finger, the third,
and afterwards the fourth, "where it is to remain." A writer in the
British Apollo (1708) answers a question:--"Why is it that the person to
be married is enjoyned to put a Ring upon the fourth finger of his
spouse's left hand?" It is answered, "There is nothing more in this,
than that the custom was handed down to the present age from the
practice of our ancestors, who found the left hand more convenient for
such ornaments than the right, in that it's ever less employed; for the
same reason they chose the fourth finger, which is not only less used
than either of the rest, but is more capable of preserving a Ring from
bruises, having this one quality peculiar to itself, that it cannot be
extended but in company with some other finger, whereas the rest may be
singly stretched to their full length and straightness.

"Some of the ancients were of opinion, in this matter, that the ring was
so worn because to that finger, and to that only, comes an artery from
the heart; but the politer knowledge of our modern anatomists having
clearly demonstrated the absurdity of that notion, we are rather
inclined to believe the continuance of the custom owing to the reason
above mentioned."

Bride-cakes originated with us by adoption from a Roman custom called
confarreation, where marriage was solemnly concluded in the presence of
ten witnesses, a cake of wheat or barley being eaten at the same time.
Herrick in his Hesperides speaking to the bride says:--

"While some repeat  
Your praise, and bless you, sprinkling you with wheat."

It is difficult to trace the changes which mark the history of
bride-cakes; at one period as the bride left the church wheat was thrown
upon her head; in a later period the wheat has disappeared altogether
and we have bride-cakes, i.e. a supply of them at a single
wedding--still later we can trace the one cake as we know it to-day in
all its elaborateness. The custom of passing slices of cake through the
wedding ring has gone out of fashion; although, we are told, maidens
still puts such slices under their pillows and dream of their lovers.
