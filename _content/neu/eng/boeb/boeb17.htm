<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>WHEN shaws beene sheene, and shradds full fayre,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves both large and longe,<BR>
Itt is merrye walkyng in the fayre forr&egrave;st<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To heare the small birdes songe.</P>
<P>The woodweele sang, and wold not cease,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting upon the spraye,<BR>
Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the greenwood where he lay.</P>
<P>"Now, by my faye," sayd jollye Robin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"A sweaven I had this night;<BR>
I dreamt me of tow wighty yemen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That fast with me can fight.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Methought they did mee beate and binde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tooke my bow mee froe;<BR>
Iff I be Robin alive in this lande,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ile be wroken on them towe."</P>
<P>"Sweavens are swift, master," quoth John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the wind that blowes ore the hill;<BR>
For if itt be never so loude this night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow it may be still."</P>
<P>"Buske yee, bowne yee, my merry men all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And John shall goe with mee,<BR>
For Ile goe seeke yond wight yeomen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In greenwood where the bee."</P>
<P>Then they cast on their gownes of grene,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tooke theyr bowes each one;<BR>
And they away to the greene forr&egrave;st<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A shooting forth are gone;</P>
<P>Untill they came to the merry greenwood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they had gladdest to bee;<BR>
There were they ware of a wight yeom&agrave;n,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His body leaned to a tree.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></P>
<P>A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of manye a man the bane;<BR>
And he was clad in his capull hyde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Topp and tayll and mayne.</P>
<P>"Stand you still, master," quoth Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under this tree so grene,<BR>
And I will go to yond wight yeom&agrave;n<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To know what he doth meane."</P>
<P>"Ah! John, by me thou settest noe store,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that I farley finde:<BR>
How offt send I my men beffore,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tarry my selfe behinde!</P>
<P>"It is no cunning a knave to ken,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a man but heare him speake;<BR>
And itt were not for bursting of my bowe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;John, I thy head wold breake."</P>
<P>As often wordes they breeden bale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So they parted Robin and John;<BR>
And John is gone to Barnesdale;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates he knoweth eche one.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></P>
<P>But when he came to Barnesdale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Great heavinesse there hee hadd,<BR>
For he found tow of his owne fell&ograve;wes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were slaine both in a slade.</P>
<P>And Scarlette he was flying a-foote<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Faste over stocke and stone,<BR>
For the sheriffe with seven score men<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast after him is gone.</P>
<P>"One shoote now I will shoote," quoth John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"With Christ his might and mayne;<BR>
Ile make yond fellow that flyes soe fast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To stopp he shall be fayne."</P>
<P>Then John bent up his long bende-bowe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fetteled him to shoote:<BR>
The bow was made of tender boughe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fell down to his foote.</P>
<P>"Woe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ere thou grew on a tree;<BR>
For now this day thou art my bale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My boote when thou shold bee."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></P>
<P>His shoote it was but loosely shott,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet flewe not the arrowe in vaine,<BR>
For itt mett one of the sherriffes men,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Good William a Trent was slaine.</P>
<P>It had bene better of William a Trent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To have bene abed with sorrowe,<BR>
Than to be that day in the green-wood slade<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet with Little Johns arrowe.</P>
<P>But as it is said, when men be mett<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fyve can doe more than three,<BR>
The sheriffe hath taken Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bound him fast to a tree.</P>
<P>"Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hanged hye on a hill;"<BR>
But thou mayst fayle of thy purpose," quoth John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If itt be Christ his will."</P>
<P>Lett us leave talking of Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thinke of Robin Hood,<BR>
How he is gone to the wight yeom&agrave;n,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where under the leaves he stood.</P>

<P>"Good morrowe, good fellowe," sayd Robin so fayre,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morrowe, good fellow," quoth he.<BR>
"Methinks by this bowe thou beares in thy hande,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A good archere thou sholdst bee."</P>
<P>"I am wilfulle of my waye," quo' the yeoman,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And of my morning tyde:"<BR>
"Ile lead thee through the wood," sayd Robin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good fellow, Ile be thy guide."</P>
<P>"I seeke an outl&agrave;we," the straunger sayd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men call him Robin Hood;<BR>
Rather Ild meet with that proud outl&agrave;we<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than fortye pound soe good."</P>
<P>"Now come with me, thou wight yem&agrave;n,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Robin thou soone shalt see;<BR>
But first let us some pastime find<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the greenwood tree.</P>
<P>"First let us some masterye make<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the woods so even;<BR>
We may chance to meet with Robin Hood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here att some unsett steven."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></P>
<P>They cutt them down two summer shroggs,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That grew both under a breere,<BR>
And set them threescore rood in twaine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shoote the prickes y-fere.</P>
<P>"Leade on, good fellowe," quoth Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leade on, I doe bidd thee."<BR>
"Nay, by my faith, good fellowe," hee sayd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"My leader thou shalt bee."</P>
<P>The first time Robin shot at the pricke,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He mist but an inch it fro;<BR>
The yeoman he was an archer good,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he cold never shoote soe.</P>
<P>The second shoote had the wightye yeom&agrave;n,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shote within the garl&agrave;nde;<BR>
But Robin he shott far better than hee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he clave the good pricke-wande.</P>
<P>A blessing upon thy heart," he sayd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good fellowe, thy shooting is goode<BR>
For an thy hart be as good as thy hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wert better then Robin Hoode.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now tell me thy name, good fellowe," sayd he,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the leaves of lyne."<BR>
Nay, by my faith," quoth bolde Robin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Till thou have told me thine."</P>
<P>"I dwell by dale and downe," quoth hee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Robin to take Ime sworne;<BR>
And when I am called by my right name,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Guy of good Gisb&ograve;rne."</P>
<P>"My dwelling is in this wood," sayes Robin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"By thee I set right nought:<BR>
I am Robin Hood of Barn&egrave;sdale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom thou so long hast sought."</P>
<P>He that had neither beene kithe nor kin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might have seen a full fayre sight,<BR>
To see how together these yeomen went<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With blades both browne and bright:</P>
<P>To see how these yeomen together they fought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two howres of a summers day,<BR>
Yett neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Them fettled to flye away.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A></P>
<P>Robin was reachles on a roote,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stumbled at that tyde;<BR>
And Guy was quicke and nimble with-all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hitt him ore the left side.</P>
<P>"Ah, deere Lady," sayd Robin Hood tho,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art but mother and may';<BR>
I think it was never mans destinye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To dye before his day."</P>
<P>Robin thought on Our Ladye deere,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soone leapt up againe,<BR>
And strait he came with a 'backward' stroke,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he Sir Guy hath slayne.</P>
<P>He took Sir Guy's head by the hayre,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stuck itt upon his bowes end:<BR>
"Thou hast beene a traytor all thy liffe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which thing must have an end."</P>
<P>Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nicked Sir Guy in the face,<BR>
That he was never on woman born<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold tell whose head it was.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A></P>
<P>Sayes, "Lye there, lye there now, Sir Guy,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with me be not wrothe;<BR>
Iff thou have had the worst strokes at my hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt have the better clothe."</P>
<P>Robin did off his gowne of greene,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on Sir Guy did throwe,<BR>
And hee put on that capull hyde,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That cladd him topp to toe.</P>
<P>"The bowe, the arrowes, and litle horne,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with me I will beare;<BR>
For I will away to Barn&egrave;sdale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see how my men doe fare."</P>
<P>Robin Hood sett Guy's horne to his mouth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a loud blast in it did blow:<BR>
That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he leaned under a lowe.</P>
<P>Hearken, hearken," sayd the sheriffe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heare nowe tydings good,<BR>
For yonder I heare Sir Guy's horne blowe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he hath slaine Robin Hoode.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Yonder I heare Sir Guy's horne blowe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Itt blowes soe well in tyde,<BR>
And yonder comes that wightye yeom&agrave;n,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cladd in his capull hyde.</P>
<P>"Come hyther, come hyther, thou good Sir Guy,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aske what thou wilt of mee."<BR>
"O I will none of thy gold," sayd Robin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor I will none of thy fee.</P>
<P>"But now I have slaine the master," he sayes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me goe strike the knave;<BR>
For this is all the rewarde I aske.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor noe other will I have."</P>
<P>"Thou art a madman," said the sheriffe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou sholdst have had a knightes fee;<BR>
But seeing thy asking hath beene soe bad,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well granted it shale be."</P>
<P>When Little John heard his master speake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knewe he it was his steven;<BR>
Now shall I be looset," quoth Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Christ his might in heaven."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A></P>
<P>Fast Robin hee hyed him to Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought to loose him belive:<BR>
The sheriffe and all his companye<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast after him can drive.</P>
<P>"Stand abacke, stand abacke," sayd Robin;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why draw you mee so neere?<BR>
Itt was never the use in our country&egrave;,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ones shrift another shold heere."</P>
<P>But Robin pulled forth an Irysh knife,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And losed John hand and foote,<BR>
And gave him Sir Guy's bow into his hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade it be his boote.</P>
<P>Then John he took Guy's bow in his hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His boltes and arrowes eche one:<BR>
When the sheriffe saw Little John bend his bow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fettled him to be gone.</P>
<P>Towards his house in Nottingham towne<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fled full fast away,<BR>
And soe did all the companye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one behind wold stay.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></P>
<P>But he cold neither runne soe fast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor away soe fast cold ryde,<BR>
But Little John with an arrowe soe broad<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shott him into the 'backe'-syde.</P>
