<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>BE it right, or wrong, these men among<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On women do complain;<BR>
Affirming this, how that it is<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A labour spent in vain<BR>
To love them wele; for never a dele<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They love a man again:<BR>
For let a man do what he can,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their favour to attain,<BR>
Yet, if a new do them pursue,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their first true lover then<BR>
Laboureth for nought; for from her thought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a banished man.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A></P>
<P>I say not nay, but that all day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is both writ and said<BR>
That woman's faith is, as who saith,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All utterly decayed;<BR>
But, nevertheless, right good witn&egrave;ss<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case might be laid,<BR>
That they love true, and contin&ugrave;e,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Record the Nut-brown Maid:<BR>
Which, when her love came, her to prove,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To her to make his moan,<BR>
Would not depart; for in her heart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She loved but him alone.</P>
<P>Then between us let us discuss<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What was all the manere<BR>
Between them two: we will also<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell all the pain, and fere,<BR>
That she was in. Now I begin,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that ye me answ&egrave;re;<BR>
Wherefore, all ye, that present be<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray you, give an ear.<BR>
I am the knight; I come by night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As secret as I can; <A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A><BR>
Saying,' Alas! thus standeth the case,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a banished man.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>And I your will for to fulfil<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this will not refuse;<BR>
Trusting to shew, in word&egrave;s few,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That men have an ill use<BR>
(To their own shame) women to blame,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And causeless them accuse:<BR>
Therefore to you I answer now,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All women to excuse,--<BR>
Mine own heart dear, with you what chere?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray you, tell anone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>It standeth so; a dede is do<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof great harm shall grow<BR>
My destiny is for to die<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A shameful death, I trowe; <A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A><BR>
Or else to flee: the one must be.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;None other way I know,<BR>
But to withdraw as an outlaw,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And take me to my bow.<BR>
Wherefore, adieu, my own heart true!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;None other rede I can:<BR>
For I must to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>O Lord, what is this worldys bliss,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That changeth as the moon!<BR>
My summer's day in lusty May<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is darked before the noon.<BR>
I hear you say, farewell: Nay, nay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We d&egrave;part not so soon.<BR>
Why say ye so? wheder will ye go?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! what have ye done?<BR>
All my welf&agrave;re to sorrow and care<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should change, if ye were gone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>I can believe, it shall you grieve,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And somewhat you distrain;<BR>
But, afterward, your pain&egrave;s hard<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a day or twain<BR>
Shall soon aslake; and ye shall take<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comfort to you again.<BR>
Why should ye ought? for, to make thought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your labour were in vain.<BR>
And thus I do; and pray you to.,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As heartily as I can;<BR>
For I must to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>Now, sith that ye have shewed to me<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of your mind,<BR>
I shall be plain to you again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like as ye shall me find.<BR>
Sith it is so, that ye will go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wolle not leave behind;<BR>
Shall never be said, the Nut-brown Maid<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was to her love unkind: <A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A><BR>
Make you read&#7923;, for so am I,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it were anone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>Yet I you rede to take good heed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What men will think and say:<BR>
Of young and old it shall be told.,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ye be gone away,<BR>
Your wanton will for to fulfil,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In green wood you to play;<BR>
And that ye might from your delight<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer make delay.<BR>
Rather than ye should thus for me<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be called an ill wom&agrave;n,<BR>
Yet would I to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>Though it be sung of old and young,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I should be to blame, <A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A><BR>
Theirs be the charge, that speak so large<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In hurting of my name:<BR>
For I will prove, that, faithful love<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is devoid of shame;<BR>
In your distress, and heaviness,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To part with you, the same:<BR>
And sure all tho, that do not so,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;True lovers are they none;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>I counsel you, remember how,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no maiden's law,<BR>
Nothing to doubt, but to renne out<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wood with an outl&agrave;w:<BR>
For ye must there in your hand bear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bow, read&#7923; to draw;<BR>
And, as a thief, thus must you live,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever in dread and awe;<BR>
Whereby to you great harm might grow:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet had I lever than, <A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A><BR>
That I had to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>I think not nay, but as ye say,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no maiden's lore;<BR>
But love may make me for your sake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before,<BR>
To come on foot, to hunt, and shoot<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To get us meat in store;<BR>
For so that I your company<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May have, I ask no more:<BR>
From which to part, it maketh my heart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As cold as any stone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>For an outl&agrave;w this is the law,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That men him take and bind;<BR>
Without pit&#7923;, hang&egrave;d to be,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And waver with the wind. <A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A><BR>
If I had nede, (as God forbede!)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What rescue could ye find?<BR>
Forsooth, I trow, ye and your bow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear would draw behind:<BR>
And no mervayle: for little avail<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were in your counsel then:<BR>
Wherefore I will to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>Right well know ye, that women be<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But feeble for to fight;<BR>
No womanhede it is indeed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be bold as a knight:<BR>
Yet, in such fear if that ye were<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With enemies day or night,<BR>
I would withstand, with bow in hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To greve them as I might,<BR>
And you to save; as women have<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From death men many a one:<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>Yet take good hede; for ever I drede<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ye could not sustain<BR>
The thorny ways, the deep vall&egrave;ys,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow, the frost, the rain,<BR>
The cold, the heat: for dry, or wet,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We must lodge on the plain;<BR>
And, us above, none other roof<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But a brake bush, or twain;<BR>
Which soon should grieve you, I believe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ye would gladly then<BR>
That I had to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>Sith I have here been partyn&egrave;re<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With you of joy and bliss,<BR>
I must als&ograve; part of your woe<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Endure, as reason is:<BR>
Yet am I sure of one pleas&ugrave;re;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, shortly, it is this:<BR>
That, where ye be, me seemeth, pard&egrave;,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not fare amiss. <A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A><BR>
Without more speech, I you beseech<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That we were soon agone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>If ye go thyder, ye must consider,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When ye have lust to dine,<BR>
There shall no meat be for you gete,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor drink, beer, ale, nor wine.<BR>
No shet&egrave;s clean, to lie between,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of thread and twine;<BR>
None other house, but leaves and boughs,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover your head and mine;<BR>
O mine heart sweet, this evil di&egrave;te<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should make you pale and wan;<BR>
Wherefore I will to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>Among the wild dere, such an arch&egrave;re,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As men say that ye be, <A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A><BR>
Ne may not fail of good vit&agrave;yle,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is so great plent&#7923;:<BR>
And water clear of the ryv&eacute;re<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be full sweet to me;<BR>
With which in hele I shall right wele<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Endure, as ye shall see;<BR>
And, or we go, a bed or two<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can provide anone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>Lo! yet, before, ye must do more,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If ye will go with me:<BR>
As cut your hair up by your ear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your kirtle by the knee;<BR>
With bow in hand, for to withstand<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your enemies, if need be:<BR>
And this same night before day-light,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wood-ward will I flee.<BR>
If that ye will all this fulfil,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do it shortly as ye can <A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A><BR>
Else will I to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>I shall as now do more for you<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than 'longeth to womanhede;<BR>
To shorte my hair, a bow to bear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shoot in time of need.<BR>
O my sweet mother, before all other<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For you I have most drede:<BR>
But now, adieu! I must ensue,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where fortune doth me lead.<BR>
All this make ye: Now let us flee;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The day cometh fast upon;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>Nay, nay, not so; ye shall not go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall tell ye why,--<BR>
Your appetite is to be light<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love, I wele espy: <A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A><BR>
For, like as ye have said to me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In like wise hardely<BR>
Ye would answ&egrave;re whosoever it were<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In way of compan&#7923;.<BR>
It is said of old, Soon hot, soon cold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so is a wom&agrave;n.<BR>
Wherefore I to the wood will go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>If ye take heed, it is no need<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such words to say by me;<BR>
For oft ye prayed, and long assayed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I you loved, pard&egrave;:<BR>
And though that I of ancestry<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A baron's daughter be,<BR>
Yet have you proved how I you loved<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A squire of low degree;<BR>
And ever shall, whatso befall;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To die therefore anone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>A baron's child to be beguiled!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It were a curs&egrave;d dede;<BR>
To be fel&agrave;we with an outl&agrave;we!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Almighty God forbede!<BR>
Yet better were, the poor squy&egrave;re<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone to forest yede,<BR>
Than ye should say another day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That, by my curs&egrave;d dede,<BR>
Ye were betrayed: Wherefore, good maid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The best rede that I can,<BR>
Is, that I to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>Whatever befall, I never shall<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this thing you upbraid:<BR>
But if ye go, and leave me so,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then have ye me betrayed.<BR>
Remember you wele, how that ye dele;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For, if ye, as ye said,<BR>
Be so unkind, to leave behind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your love, the Nut-brown Maid, <A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A><BR>
Trust me trul&#7923;, that I shall die<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after ye be gone;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>If that ye went, ye should repent;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For in the forest now<BR>
I have purvayed me of a maid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom I love more than you;<BR>
Another fayr&egrave;re, than ever ye were,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare it wele avow;<BR>
And of you both each should be wroth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With other, as I trow:<BR>
It were mine ease, to live in peace;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So will I, if I can;<BR>
Wherefore I to the wood will go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>Though in the wood I understood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye had a paramour, <A NAME="page_145"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 145</FONT></A><BR>
All this may nought remove my thought,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that I will be your:<BR>
And she shall find me soft and kind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And courteys every hour;<BR>
Glad to fulfil all that she will<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Command me to my power:<BR>
For had ye, lo! an hundred mo,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of them I would be one;<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>Mine own dear love, I see the proof<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ye be kind and true;<BR>
Of maid, and wife, in all my life,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The best that ever I knew.<BR>
Be merry and glad, be no more sad,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The case is chang&egrave;d new;<BR>
For it were ruth, that, for your truth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye should have cause to rue.<BR>
Be not dismayed, whatsoever I said<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To you, when I began; <A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A><BR>
I will not to the green wood go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am no banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHE</P>
<P>These tidings be more glad to me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than to be made a queen,<BR>
If I were sure they should endure:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is often seen,<BR>
When men will break promise, they speak<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The word&egrave;s on the splene.<BR>
Ye shape some wile me to beguile,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And steal from me, I ween:<BR>
Then, were the case worse than it was,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I more wo-begone:<BR>
For, in my mind, of all mankind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I love but you alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">HE</P>
<P>Ye shall not nede further to drede;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not dispar&agrave;ge<BR>
You, (God defend!) sith ye descend<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of so great a line&agrave;ge. <A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A><BR>
Now understand; to Westmoreland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is mine heritage,<BR>
I will you bring; and with a ring,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of marri&agrave;ge<BR>
I will you take, and lady make,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As shortly as I can:<BR>
Thus have you won an erly's son,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a banished man.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">AUTHOR</P>
<P>Here may ye see, that women be<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In love, meek, kind, and stable;<BR>
Let never man reprove them then,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or call them vari&agrave;ble;<BR>
But, rather, pray God that we may<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To them be comfort&agrave;ble;<BR>
Which sometime proveth such, as he loveth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If they be charit&agrave;ble.<BR>
For sith men would that women should<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be meek to them each one;<BR>
Much more ought they to God obey,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And serve but Him alone.</P>
