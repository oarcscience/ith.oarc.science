<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>LATE at e'en, drinking the wine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere they paid the lawing,<BR>
They set a combat them between,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight it in the dawing.</P>
<P>"What though ye be my sister's lord,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll cross our swords to-morrow."<BR>
"What though my wife your sister be,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll meet ye then on Yarrow."</P>
<P>"O stay at hame, my ain gude lord!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O stay, my ain dear marrow!<BR>
My cruel brither will you betray<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dowie banks o' Yarrow."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A></P>
<P>"O fare ye weel, my lady dear!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put aside your sorrow;<BR>
For if I gae, I'll sune return<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Frae the bonny banks o' Yarrow."</P>
<P>She kiss'd his cheek, she kaim'd his hair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As oft she'd done before, O;<BR>
She belted him wi' his gude brand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he's awa' to Yarrow.</P>
<P>When he gaed up the Tennies bank,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he gaed mony a morrow,<BR>
Nine armed men lay in a den,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dowie braes o' Yarrow.</P>
<P>"O come ye here to hunt or hawk<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonny Forest thorough?<BR>
Or come ye here to wield your brand<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the banks o' Yarrow?"</P>
<P>"I come not here to hunt or hawk,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As oft I've dune before, O,<BR>
But I come here to wield my brand<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the banks o' Yarrow.</P>

<P>"If ye attack me nine to ane,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then may God send ye sorrow!--<BR>
Yet will I fight while stand I may,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bonny banks o' Yarrow."</P>
<P>Two has he hurt, and three has slain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bloody braes o' Yarrow;<BR>
But the stubborn knight crept in behind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pierced his body thorough.</P>
<P>"Gae hame, gae hame, you brither John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell your sister sorrow,--<BR>
To come and lift her leafu' lord<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the dowie banks o' Yarrow."</P>
<P>Her brither John gaed ower yon hill,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As oft he'd dune before, O;<BR>
There he met his sister dear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cam' rinnin' fast to Yarrow.</P>
<P>"I dreamt a dream last night," she says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish it binna sorrow;<BR>
I dreamt I pu'd the heather green<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wi' my true love on Yarrow."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></P>
<P>"I'll read your dream, sister," he says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll read it into sorrow;<BR>
Ye're bidden go take up your love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He's sleeping sound on Yarrow."</P>
<P>She's torn the ribbons frae her head<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That were baith braid and narrow;<BR>
She's kilted up her lang claithing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's awa' to Yarrow.</P>
<P>She's ta'en him in her arms twa,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gi'en him kisses thorough;<BR>
She sought to bind his mony wounds,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he lay dead on Yarrow.</P>
<P>"O haud your tongue," her father says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And let be a' your sorrow;<BR>
I'll wed you to a better lord<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than him ye lost on Yarrow."</P>
<P>"O haud your tongue, father," she says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far warse ye mak' my sorrow;<BR>
A better lord could never be<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than him that lies on Yarrow."</P>

<P>She kiss'd his lips, she kaim'd his hair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As aft she had dune before, O;<BR>
And there wi' grief her heart did break,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the banks o' Yarrow.</P>
