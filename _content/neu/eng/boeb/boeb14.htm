<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>KING JAMIE hath made a vow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keepe it well if he may:<BR>
That he will be at lovely London<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Saint James his day.</P>
<P>Upon Saint James his day at noone,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At faire London will I be,<BR>
And all the lords in merrie Scotland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall dine there with me.</P>
<P>"March out, march out, my merry men,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hie or low degree;<BR>
I'le weare the crowne in London towne,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that you soon shall be."</P>

<P>Then bespake good Queene Margaret,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The teares fell from her eye:<BR>
"Leave off these warres, most noble King,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Keepe your fidelitie.</P>
<P>"The water runnes swift, and wondrous deepe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From bottome unto the brimme;<BR>
My brother Henry hath men good enough;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;England is hard to winne."</P>
<P>"Away" quoth he "with this silly foole!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In prison fast let her lie:<BR>
For she is come of the English bloud,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for these words she shall dye."</P>
<P>With that bespake Lord Thomas Howard,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queenes chamberlaine that day:<BR>
If that you put Queene Margaret to death,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scotland shall rue it alway."</P>
<P>Then in a rage King Jamie did say,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Away with this foolish mome;<BR>
He shall be hanged, and the other be burned,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So soone as I come home."</P>

<P>At Flodden Field the Scots came in,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made our English men faine;<BR>
At Bramstone Greene this battaile was seene,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was King Jamie slaine.</P>
<P>His bodie never could be found,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was over throwne,<BR>
And he that wore faire Scotland's crowne<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That day could not be knowne.</P>
<P>Then presently the Scot did flie,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their cannons they left behind;<BR>
Their ensignes gay were won all away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our souldiers did beate them blinde.</P>
<P>To tell you plaine, twelve thousand were slaine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That to the fight did stand,<BR>
And many prisoners tooke that day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The best in all Scotland.</P>
<P>That day made many [a] fatherlesse child,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a widow poore,<BR>
And many a Scottish gay lady<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sate weeping in her bower.</P>

<P>Jack with a feather was lapt all in leather,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His boastings were all in vaine;<BR>
He had such a chance, with a new morrice-dance<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He never went home againe.</P>

<P>Now heaven we laude that never more<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such biding shall come to hand;<BR>
Our King, by othe, is King of both<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;England and faire Scotland.</P>
