<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">King Leir and his Three Daughters</H1>
<P>KING LEIR once rul&egrave;d in this land<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With princely power and peace,<BR>
And had all things with hearts content,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That might his joys increase.<BR>
Amongst those things that nature gave,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three daughters fair had he,<BR>
So princely seeming beautiful,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fairer could not be.</P>
<P>So on a time it pleas'd the king<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A question thus to move,<BR>
Which of his daughters to his grace<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could shew the dearest love: <A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A><BR>
"For to my age you bring content,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth he, "then let me hear,<BR>
Which of you three in plighted troth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The kindest will appear."</P>
<P>To whom the eldest thus began:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear father, mind," quoth she,<BR>
"Before your face, to do you good,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My blood shall render'd be.<BR>
And for your sake my bleeding heart<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall here be cut in twain,<BR>
Ere that I see your reverend age<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The smallest grief sustain."</P>
<P>"And so will I," the second said;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear father, for your sake,<BR>
The worst of all extremities<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll gently undertake:<BR>
And serve your highness night and day<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With diligence and love;<BR>
That sweet content and quietness<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Discomforts may remove."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></P>
<P>"In doing so, you glad my soul,"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The aged king reply'd;<BR>
But what sayst thou, my youngest girl,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How is thy love ally'd?"<BR>
"My love" (quoth young Cordelia then),<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which to your grace I owe,<BR>
Shall be the duty of a child,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is all I'll show."</P>
<P>"And wilt thou shew no more," quoth he,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Than doth thy duty bind?<BR>
I well perceive thy love is small,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When as no more I find.<BR>
Henceforth I banish thee my court;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art no child of mine;<BR>
Nor any part of this my realm<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By favour shall be thine.</P>
<P>"Thy elder sisters' loves are more<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than well I can demand;<BR>
To whom I equally bestow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My kingdome and my land, <A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A><BR>
My pompal state and all my goods,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That lovingly I may<BR>
With those thy sisters be maintain'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until my dying day."</P>
<P>Thus flattering speeches won renown,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By these two sisters here;<BR>
The third had causeless banishment,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet was her love more dear.<BR>
For poor Cordelia patiently<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went wandring up and down,<BR>
Unhelp'd, unpity'd, gentle maid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through many an English town:</P>
<P>Untill at last in famous France<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She gentler fortunes found;<BR>
Though poor and bare, yet she was deem'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairest on the ground:<BR>
Where when the king her virtues heard,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And this fair lady seen,<BR>
With full consent of all his court<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He made his wife and queen.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></P>
<P>Her father, old King Leir, this while<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his two daughters staid;<BR>
Forgetful of their promis'd loves,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full soon the same decay'd;<BR>
And living in Queen Ragan's court,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest of the twain,<BR>
She took from him his chiefest means,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And most of all his train.</P>
<P>For whereas twenty men were wont<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wait with bended knee,<BR>
She gave allowance but to ten,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And after scarce to three,<BR>
Nay, one she thought too much for him;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So took she all away,<BR>
In hope that in her court, good king,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He would no longer stay.</P>
<P>"Am I rewarded thus," quoth he,<BR>
"&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving all I have<BR>
Unto my children, and to beg<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For what I lately gave? <A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A><BR>
I'll go unto my Gonorell:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My second child, I know,<BR>
Will be more kind and pitiful,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And will relieve my woe."</P>
<P>Full fast he hies then to her court;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where when she heard his moan,<BR>
Return'd him answer, that she griev'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all his means were gone,<BR>
But no way could relieve his wants;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet if that he would stay<BR>
Within her kitchen, he should have<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What scullions gave away.</P>
<P>When he had heard, with bitter tears,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He made his answer then;<BR>
In what I did, let me be made<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Example to all men.<BR>
I will return again," quoth he,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unto my Ragan's court;<BR>
She will not use me thus, I hope,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a kinder sort."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></P>
<P>Where when he came, she gave command<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive him thence away:<BR>
When he was well within her court,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(She said) he would not stay.<BR>
Then back again to Gonorel<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The woeful king did hie,<BR>
That in her kitchen he might have<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What scullion boys set by.</P>
<P>But there of that he was deny'd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which she had promis'd late<BR>
For once refusing, he should not,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come after to her gate.<BR>
Thus twixt his daughters for relief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He wandred up and down,<BR>
Being glad to feed on beggars' food<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That lately wore a crown.</P>
<P>And calling to remembrance then<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His youngest daughters words,<BR>
That said, the duty of a child<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all that love affords--<A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A><BR>
But doubting to repair to her,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom he had ban'sh'd so,<BR>
Grew frantic mad; for in his mind<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He bore the wounds of woe.</P>
<P>Which made him rend his milk-white locks<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tresses from his head,<BR>
And all with blood bestain his cheeks,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With age and honour spread.<BR>
To hills and woods and watry founts,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He made his hourly moan,<BR>
Till hills and woods and senseless things<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did seem to sigh and groan.</P>
<P>Even thus possest with discontents,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed o'er to France,<BR>
In hopes from fair Cordelia there<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To find some gentler chance.<BR>
Most virtuous dame! which, when she heard<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this her father's grief,<BR>
As duty bound, she quickly sent<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him comfort and relief.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_05600"></A>
<A HREF="img/05600.jpg"><IMG SRC="tn/05600.jpg"><BR><FONT SIZE=-3>Click to enlarge</FONT></A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A></P>
<P>And by a train of noble peers,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In brave and gallant sort,<BR>
She gave in charge he should be brought<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Aganippus' court;<BR>
Whose royal king, with noble mind,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So freely gave consent<BR>
To muster up his knights at arms,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To fame and courage bent.</P>
<P>And so to England came with speed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To repossesse King Leir,<BR>
And drive his daughters from their thrones<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By his Cordelia dear.<BR>
Where she, true-hearted, noble queen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was in the battel stain;<BR>
Yet he, good king, in his old days,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Possest his crown again.</P>
<P>But when he heard Cordelia's death,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who died indeed for love<BR>
Of her dear father, in whose cause<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She did this battle move, <A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A><BR>
He swooning fell upon her breast,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From whence he never parted;<BR>
But on her bosom left his life<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That was so truly hearted.</P>
<P>The lords and nobles, when they saw<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of these events,<BR>
The other sisters unto death<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They doom&egrave;d by consents;<BR>
And being dead, their crowns they left<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the next of kin:<BR>
Thus have you seen the fall of pride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And disobedient sin.</P>
