<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>COME listen to me, you gallants so free,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All you that love mirth for to hear,<BR>
And I will tell you of a bold outl&agrave;w,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That lived in Nottinghamshire.</P>
<P>As Robin Hood in the forest stood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All under the greenwood tree,<BR>
There he was aware of a brave young man,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fine as fine might be.</P>
<P>The youngster was clad in scarlet red,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In scarlet fine and gay<BR>
And he did frisk it over the plain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And chaunted a roundelay.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>As Robin Hood next morning stood<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the leaves so gay,<BR>
There did he espy the same young man<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come drooping along the way.</P>
<P>The scarlet he wore the day before<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clean cast away;<BR>
And at every step he fetched a sigh,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas! and a well-a-day!"</P>
<P>Then stepp&egrave;d forth brave Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Midge, the miller's son;<BR>
Which made the young man bend his bow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When as he see them come.</P>
<P>"Stand off! stand off!" the young man said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your will with me?"<BR>
"You must come before our master straight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under yon greenwood tree."</P>
<P>And when he came bold Robin before,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Robin asked him courteously,<BR>
O, hast thou any money to spare,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For my merry men and me?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></P>
<P>"I have no money," the young man said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"But five shillings and a ring;<BR>
And that I have kept this seven long years,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To have at my wedding.</P>
<P>"Yesterday I should have married a maid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was from me ta'en,<BR>
And chosen to be an old knight's delight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereby my poor heart is slain."</P>
<P>"What is thy name?" then said Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come tell me, without any fail."<BR>
"By the faith of my body," then said the young man,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name it is Allen-a-Dale."</P>
<P>"What wilt thou give me," said Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"In ready gold or fee,<BR>
To help thee to thy true love again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And deliver her unto thee?"</P>
<P>"I have no money," then quoth the young man,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"No ready gold nor fee,<BR>
But I will swear upon a book<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy true servant for to be."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></P>
<P>"How many miles is it to thy true love?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come tell me without guile."<BR>
"By the faith of my body," then said the young man,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is but five little mile."</P>
<P>Then Robin he hasted over the plain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He did neither stint nor lin,<BR>
Until he came unto the church<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Allen should keep his weddin'.</P>
<P>"What hast thou here?" the bishop then said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prithee now tell unto me."<BR>
"I am a bold harper," quoth Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the best in the north countr&#7923;."</P>
<P>"O welcome, O welcome," the bishop he said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"That music best pleaseth me."<BR>
"You shall have no music," quoth Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Till the bride and bridegroom I see."</P>
<P>With that came in a wealthy knight,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was both grave and old;<BR>
And after him a finikin lass,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did shine like the glistering gold.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></P>
<P>"This is not a fit match," quoth Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"That you do seem to make here;<BR>
For since we are come into the church,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride shall chuse her own dear."</P>
<P>Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blew blasts two and three;<BR>
When four-and-twenty bowmen bold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came leaping over the lea.</P>
<P>And when they came into the church-yard,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Marching all in a row,<BR>
The first man was Allen-a-Dale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To give bold Robin his bow.</P>
<P>"This is thy true love," Robin he said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Allen, as I hear say;<BR>
And you shall be married this same time,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we depart away."</P>
<P>"That shall not be," the bishop he cried,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"For thy word shall not stand;<BR>
They shall be three times asked in the church,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law is of our land."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Robin Hood pulled off the bishop's coat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put it upon Little John;<BR>
"By the faith of my body," then Robin said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"This cloth doth make thee a man."</P>
<P>When Little John went into the quire,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The people began to laugh;<BR>
He asked them seven times into church,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest three times should not be enough.</P>
<P>"Who gives me this maid?" said Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Robin Hood, "That do I;<BR>
And he that takes her from Allen-a-Dale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full dearly he shall her buy."</P>
<P>And then having ended this merry wedding,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride looked like a queen;<BR>
And so they returned to the merry greenwood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the leaves so green.</P>
