<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>"ANNAN Water's wading deep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my love Annie's wondrous bonny;<BR>
I will keep my tryst to-night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And win the heart o' lovely Annie."</P>
<P>He's loupen on his bonny grey,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He rade the right gate and the ready',<BR>
For a' the storm he wadna stay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For seeking o' his bonny lady.</P>
<P>And he has ridden o'er field and fell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through muir and moss, and stones and mire;<BR>
His spurs o' steel were sair to bide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And frae her four feet flew the fire.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></P>
<P>"My bonny grey, noo play your part!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gin ye be the steed that wins my dearie,<BR>
Wi' corn and hay ye'se be fed for aye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never spur sail mak' you wearie."</P>
<P>The grey was a mare, and a right gude mare:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she wan the Annan Water,<BR>
She couldna hae found the ford that night<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a thousand merks been wadded at her.</P>
<P>"O boatman, boatman, put off your boat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Put off your boat for gouden money!"<BR>
But for a' the goud in fair Scotland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He dared na tak' him through to Annie.</P>
<P>"O I was sworn sae late yestreen,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not by a single aith, but mony.<BR>
I'll cross the drumly stream to-night,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or never could I face my honey."</P>
<P>The side was stey, and the bottom deep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Frae bank to brae the water pouring;<BR>
The bonny grey mare she swat for fear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For she heard the water-kelpy roaring.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></P>
<P>He spurred her forth into the flood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wot she swam both strong and steady;<BR>
But the stream was broad, her strength did fail,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he never saw his bonny lady.</P>
<P>O wae betide the frush saugh wand!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wae betide the bush of brier!<BR>
That bent and brake into his hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When strength of man and horse did tire.</P>
<P>And wae betide ye, Annan Water!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This night ye are a drumly river;<BR>
But over thee we'll build a brig,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ye nae mair true love may sever.</P>
