<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>ALL in the merry month of May,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When green buds they were swelling,<BR>
Young Jemmy Grove on his death-bed lay<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For love o' Barbara Allen.</P>
<P>He sent his man unto her then,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the town where she was dwelling:<BR>
"O haste and come to my master dear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If your name be Barbara Allen."</P>
<P>Slowly, slowly rase she up,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she cam' where he was lying;<BR>
And when she drew the curtain by,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Says, "Young man, I think you're dying."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A></P>
<P>"O it's I am sick, and very, very sick,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's a' for Barbara Allen."<BR>
"O the better for me ye'se never be,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' your heart's blude were a-spilling!</P>
<P>"O dinna ye min', young man," she says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the red wine ye were filling,<BR>
That ye made the healths gae round and round<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ye slighted Barbara Allen?"</P>
<P>He turn'd his face unto the wa',<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And death was wi' him dealing:<BR>
"Adieu, adieu, my dear friends a';<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be kind to Barbara Allen."</P>
<P>As she was walking o'er the fields,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard the dead-bell knelling;<BR>
And every jow the dead-bell gave,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It cried, "Woe to Barbara Allen!"</P>
<P>"O mother, mother, mak' my bed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lay me down in sorrow.<BR>
My love has died for me to-day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll die for him to-morrow."</P>
