# The Nut-brown Maid

BE it right, or wrong, these men among  
  On women do complain;  
Affirming this, how that it is  
  A labour spent in vain  
To love them wele; for never a dele  
  They love a man again:  
For let a man do what he can,  
  Their favour to attain,  
Yet, if a new do them pursue,  
  Their first true lover then  
Laboureth for nought; for from her thought  
  He is a banished man.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

I say not nay, but that all day  
  It is both writ and said  
That woman's faith is, as who saith,  
  All utterly decayed;  
But, nevertheless, right good witnèss  
  In this case might be laid,  
That they love true, and continùe,  
  Record the Nut-brown Maid:  
Which, when her love came, her to prove,  
  To her to make his moan,  
Would not depart; for in her heart  
  She loved but him alone.

Then between us let us discuss  
  What was all the manere  
Between them two: we will also  
  Tell all the pain, and fere,  
That she was in. Now I begin,  
  So that ye me answère;  
Wherefore, all ye, that present be  
  I pray you, give an ear.  
I am the knight; I come by night,  
  As secret as I can; <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>  
Saying,' Alas! thus standeth the case,  
  I am a banished man.'

SHE

And I your will for to fulfil  
  In this will not refuse;  
Trusting to shew, in wordès few,  
  That men have an ill use  
(To their own shame) women to blame,  
  And causeless them accuse:  
Therefore to you I answer now,  
  All women to excuse,--  
Mine own heart dear, with you what chere?  
  I pray you, tell anone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

It standeth so; a dede is do  
  Whereof great harm shall grow  
My destiny is for to die  
  A shameful death, I trowe; <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>  
Or else to flee: the one must be.  
  None other way I know,  
But to withdraw as an outlaw,  
  And take me to my bow.  
Wherefore, adieu, my own heart true!  
  None other rede I can:  
For I must to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

O Lord, what is this worldys bliss,  
  That changeth as the moon!  
My summer's day in lusty May  
  Is darked before the noon.  
I hear you say, farewell: Nay, nay,  
  We dèpart not so soon.  
Why say ye so? wheder will ye go?  
  Alas! what have ye done?  
All my welfàre to sorrow and care  
  Should change, if ye were gone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

HE

I can believe, it shall you grieve,  
  And somewhat you distrain;  
But, afterward, your painès hard  
  Within a day or twain  
Shall soon aslake; and ye shall take  
  Comfort to you again.  
Why should ye ought? for, to make thought  
  Your labour were in vain.  
And thus I do; and pray you to.,  
  As heartily as I can;  
For I must to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

Now, sith that ye have shewed to me  
  The secret of your mind,  
I shall be plain to you again,  
  Like as ye shall me find.  
Sith it is so, that ye will go,  
  I wolle not leave behind;  
Shall never be said, the Nut-brown Maid  
  Was to her love unkind: <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>  
Make you readỳ, for so am I,  
  Although it were anone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

Yet I you rede to take good heed  
  What men will think and say:  
Of young and old it shall be told.,  
  That ye be gone away,  
Your wanton will for to fulfil,  
  In green wood you to play;  
And that ye might from your delight  
  No longer make delay.  
Rather than ye should thus for me  
  Be called an ill womàn,  
Yet would I to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

Though it be sung of old and young,  
  That I should be to blame, <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>  
Theirs be the charge, that speak so large  
  In hurting of my name:  
For I will prove, that, faithful love  
  It is devoid of shame;  
In your distress, and heaviness,  
  To part with you, the same:  
And sure all tho, that do not so,  
  True lovers are they none;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

I counsel you, remember how,  
  It is no maiden's law,  
Nothing to doubt, but to renne out  
  To wood with an outlàw:  
For ye must there in your hand bear  
  A bow, readỳ to draw;  
And, as a thief, thus must you live,  
  Ever in dread and awe;  
Whereby to you great harm might grow:  
  Yet had I lever than, <span id="page_136">p. 136</span>  
That I had to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

I think not nay, but as ye say,  
  It is no maiden's lore;  
But love may make me for your sake,  
  As I have said before,  
To come on foot, to hunt, and shoot  
  To get us meat in store;  
For so that I your company  
  May have, I ask no more:  
From which to part, it maketh my heart  
  As cold as any stone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

For an outlàw this is the law,  
  That men him take and bind;  
Without pitỳ, hangèd to be,  
  And waver with the wind. <span id="page_137">p. 137</span>  
If I had nede, (as God forbede!)  
  What rescue could ye find?  
Forsooth, I trow, ye and your bow  
  For fear would draw behind:  
And no mervayle: for little avail  
  Were in your counsel then:  
Wherefore I will to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

Right well know ye, that women be  
  But feeble for to fight;  
No womanhede it is indeed  
  To be bold as a knight:  
Yet, in such fear if that ye were  
  With enemies day or night,  
I would withstand, with bow in hand,  
  To greve them as I might,  
And you to save; as women have  
  From death men many a one:  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

HE

Yet take good hede; for ever I drede  
  That ye could not sustain  
The thorny ways, the deep vallèys,  
  The snow, the frost, the rain,  
The cold, the heat: for dry, or wet,  
  We must lodge on the plain;  
And, us above, none other roof  
  But a brake bush, or twain;  
Which soon should grieve you, I believe,  
  And ye would gladly then  
That I had to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

Sith I have here been partynère  
  With you of joy and bliss,  
I must alsò part of your woe  
  Endure, as reason is:  
Yet am I sure of one pleasùre;  
  And, shortly, it is this:  
That, where ye be, me seemeth, pardè,  
  I could not fare amiss. <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>  
Without more speech, I you beseech  
  That we were soon agone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

If ye go thyder, ye must consider,  
  When ye have lust to dine,  
There shall no meat be for you gete,  
  Nor drink, beer, ale, nor wine.  
No shetès clean, to lie between,  
  Made of thread and twine;  
None other house, but leaves and boughs,  
  To cover your head and mine;  
O mine heart sweet, this evil diète  
  Should make you pale and wan;  
Wherefore I will to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

Among the wild dere, such an archère,  
  As men say that ye be, <span id="page_140">p. 140</span>  
Ne may not fail of good vitàyle,  
  Where is so great plentỳ:  
And water clear of the ryvére  
  Shall be full sweet to me;  
With which in hele I shall right wele  
  Endure, as ye shall see;  
And, or we go, a bed or two  
  I can provide anone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

Lo! yet, before, ye must do more,  
  If ye will go with me:  
As cut your hair up by your ear,  
  Your kirtle by the knee;  
With bow in hand, for to withstand  
  Your enemies, if need be:  
And this same night before day-light,  
  To wood-ward will I flee.  
If that ye will all this fulfil,  
  Do it shortly as ye can <span id="page_141">p. 141</span>  
Else will I to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

I shall as now do more for you  
  Than 'longeth to womanhede;  
To shorte my hair, a bow to bear,  
  To shoot in time of need.  
O my sweet mother, before all other  
  For you I have most drede:  
But now, adieu! I must ensue,  
  Where fortune doth me lead.  
All this make ye: Now let us flee;  
  The day cometh fast upon;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

Nay, nay, not so; ye shall not go,  
  And I shall tell ye why,--  
Your appetite is to be light  
  Of love, I wele espy: <span id="page_142">p. 142</span>  
For, like as ye have said to me,  
  In like wise hardely  
Ye would answère whosoever it were  
  In way of companỳ.  
It is said of old, Soon hot, soon cold  
  And so is a womàn.  
Wherefore I to the wood will go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

If ye take heed, it is no need  
  Such words to say by me;  
For oft ye prayed, and long assayed,  
  Or I you loved, pardè:  
And though that I of ancestry  
  A baron's daughter be,  
Yet have you proved how I you loved  
  A squire of low degree;  
And ever shall, whatso befall;  
  To die therefore anone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

A baron's child to be beguiled!  
  It were a cursèd dede;  
To be felàwe with an outlàwe!  
  Almighty God forbede!  
Yet better were, the poor squyère  
  Alone to forest yede,  
Than ye should say another day,  
  That, by my cursèd dede,  
Ye were betrayed: Wherefore, good maid,  
  The best rede that I can,  
Is, that I to the green wood go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

Whatever befall, I never shall  
  Of this thing you upbraid:  
But if ye go, and leave me so,  
  Then have ye me betrayed.  
Remember you wele, how that ye dele;  
  For, if ye, as ye said,  
Be so unkind, to leave behind,  
  Your love, the Nut-brown Maid, <span id="page_144">p. 144</span>  
Trust me trulỳ, that I shall die  
  Soon after ye be gone;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

If that ye went, ye should repent;  
  For in the forest now  
I have purvayed me of a maid,  
  Whom I love more than you;  
Another fayrère, than ever ye were,  
  I dare it wele avow;  
And of you both each should be wroth  
  With other, as I trow:  
It were mine ease, to live in peace;  
  So will I, if I can;  
Wherefore I to the wood will go,  
  Alone, a banished man.

SHE

Though in the wood I understood  
  Ye had a paramour, <span id="page_145">p. 145</span>  
All this may nought remove my thought,  
  But that I will be your:  
And she shall find me soft and kind,  
  And courteys every hour;  
Glad to fulfil all that she will  
  Command me to my power:  
For had ye, lo! an hundred mo,  
  Of them I would be one;  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

Mine own dear love, I see the proof  
  That ye be kind and true;  
Of maid, and wife, in all my life,  
  The best that ever I knew.  
Be merry and glad, be no more sad,  
  The case is changèd new;  
For it were ruth, that, for your truth,  
  Ye should have cause to rue.  
Be not dismayed, whatsoever I said  
  To you, when I began; <span id="page_146">p. 146</span>  
I will not to the green wood go,  
  I am no banished man.

SHE

These tidings be more glad to me,  
  Than to be made a queen,  
If I were sure they should endure:  
  But it is often seen,  
When men will break promise, they speak  
  The wordès on the splene.  
Ye shape some wile me to beguile,  
  And steal from me, I ween:  
Then, were the case worse than it was,  
  And I more wo-begone:  
For, in my mind, of all mankind  
  I love but you alone.

HE

Ye shall not nede further to drede;  
  I will not disparàge  
You, (God defend!) sith ye descend  
  Of so great a lineàge. <span id="page_147">p. 147</span>  
Now understand; to Westmoreland,  
  Which is mine heritage,  
I will you bring; and with a ring,  
  By way of marriàge  
I will you take, and lady make,  
  As shortly as I can:  
Thus have you won an erly's son,  
  And not a banished man.

AUTHOR

Here may ye see, that women be  
  In love, meek, kind, and stable;  
Let never man reprove them then,  
  Or call them variàble;  
But, rather, pray God that we may  
  To them be comfortàble;  
Which sometime proveth such, as he loveth,  
  If they be charitàble.  
For sith men would that women should  
  Be meek to them each one;  
Much more ought they to God obey,  
  And serve but Him alone.
