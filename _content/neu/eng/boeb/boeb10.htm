<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>THERE was a youthe, and a well-beloved youthe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was a squire's son;<BR>
He loved the bayliffe's daughter deare,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That lived in Islington.</P>
<P>Yet she was coye, and would not believe<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he did love her soe,<BR>
Noe nor at any time would she<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Any countenance to him showe.</P>
<P>But when his friendes did understand<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His fond and foolish minde,<BR>
They sent him up to faire London,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An apprentice for to binde.</P>
<P></P>
<P>And when he had been seven long yeares,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never his love could see,--<BR>
"Many a teare have I shed for her sake,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When she little thought of mee."</P>
<P>Then all the maids of Islington<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went forth to sport and playe,<BR>
All but the bayliffe's daughter deare;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She secretly stole awaye.</P>
<P>She pulled off her gowne of greene,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put on ragged attire,<BR>
And to faire London she would go<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her true love to enquire.</P>
<P>And as she went along the high road,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather being hot and drye,<BR>
She sat her downe upon a green bank,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And her true love came riding bye.</P>
<P>She started up, with a colour soe redd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Catching hold of his bridle-reine;<BR>
"One penny, one penny, kind sir," she sayd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will ease me of much paine."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Before I give you one penny, sweet-heart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praye tell me where you were borne."<BR>
"At Islington, kind sir," sayd shee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where I have had many a scorne."</P>
<P>"I prythee, sweet-heart, then tell to mee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O tell me, whether you knowe<BR>
The bayliffes daughter of Islington."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is dead, sir, long agoe."</P>
<P>"If she be dead, then take my horse,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My saddle and bridle also;<BR>
For I will into some farr countrye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where noe man shall me knowe."</P>
<P>"O staye, O staye, thou goodlye youthe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She standeth by thy side;<BR>
She is here alive, she is not dead,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And readye to be thy bride."</P>
<P>"O farewell griefe, and welcome joye,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten thousand times therefore;<BR>
For nowe I have founde mine owne true love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom I thought I should never see more."</P>
