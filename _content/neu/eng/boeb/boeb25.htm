<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>MY love he built me a bonny bower,<BR>
And clad it a' wi' a lilye flower,<BR>
A brawer bower ye ne'er did see,<BR>
Than my true love he built for me.</P>
<P>There came a man, by middle day,<BR>
He spied his sport and went away,<BR>
And brought the king that very night,<BR>
Who brake my bower, and slew my knight.</P>
<P>He slew my knight, to me so dear;<BR>
He slew my knight, and poined his gear;<BR>
My servants all for life did flee,<BR>
And left me in extremitie.</P>

<P>I sewed his sheet, making my mane;<BR>
I watched the corpse, myself alane;<BR>
I watched his body, night and day;<BR>
No living creature came that way.</P>
<P>I took his body on my back,<BR>
And whiles I gaed, and whiles I sat,<BR>
I digged a grave, and laid him in,<BR>
And happed him with the sod so green.</P>
<P>But think na ye my heart was sair,<BR>
When I laid the moul' on his yellow hair;<BR>
Think na ye my heart was wae,<BR>
When I turned about, away to gae?</P>
<P>Nae living man I'll love again,<BR>
Since that my lovely knight is slain;<BR>
W? ae lock of his yellow hair<BR>
I'll chain my heart for evermair.</P>
