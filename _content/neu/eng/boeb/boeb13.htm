<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>ABOUT Yule, when the wind blew cool;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the round tables began,<BR>
A' there is come to our king's court<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mony a well-favoured man.</P>
<P>The queen looked o'er the castle wa',<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld baith dale and down,<BR>
And then she saw young Waters<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Come riding to the town.</P>
<P>His footmen they did rin before,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His horsemen rade behind;<BR>
Ane mantle of the burning gowd<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did keep him frae the wind.</P>

<P>Gowden graith'd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> his horse before,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And siller shod behind;<BR>
The horse young Waters rade upon<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fleeter than the wind.</P>
<P>Out then spake a wily lord,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the queen said he:<BR>
"O tell me wha's the fairest face<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rides in the company?"</P>
<P>"I've seen lord, and I've seen laird,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And knights of high degree,<BR>
But a fairer face than young Waters<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine eyen did never see."</P>
<P>Out then spake the jealous king<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And an angry man was he:<BR>
"O if he had been twice as fair,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You might have excepted me."</P>
<P>"You're neither laird nor lord," she says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the king that wears the crown;<BR>
There is not a knight in fair Scotland,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But to thee maun bow down."</P>
<P>

But for the words which she had said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Waters he maun dee.</P>
<P>They hae ta'en young Waters,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put fetters to his feet;<BR>
They hae ta'en young Waters,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thrown him in dungeon deep.</P>
<P>"Aft I have ridden thro' Stirling town,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wind but and the weet;<BR>
But I ne'er rade thro' Stirling town<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wi' fetters at my feet.</P>
<P>"Aft have I ridden thro' Stirling town,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wind but and the rain;<BR>
But I ne'er rade thro' Stirling town<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er to return again."</P>
<P>They hae ta'en to the heading-hill<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His young son in his cradle;<BR>
And they hae ta'en to the heading-hill<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His horse but and his saddle.</P>

His lady fair to see;<BR>
And for the words the queen had spoke<BR>
Young Waters he did dee.</P>
