<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>WHEN Robin Hood and Little John<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Down a down, a down, a down</I>,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went o'er yon bank of broom,<BR>
Said Robin Hood to Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have shot for many a pound:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Hey down, a down, a down</I>.</P>
<P>"But I am not able to shoot one shot more,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My arrows will not flee;<BR>
But I have a cousin lives down below,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please God, she will bleed me."</P>
<P>Now Robin is to fair Kirkley gone,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fast as he can win; <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A><BR>
But before he came there, as we do hear,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken very ill.</P>
<P>And when that he came to fair Kirkley-hall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked all at the ring,<BR>
But none was so ready as his cousin herself<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For to let bold Robin in.</P>
<P>"Will you please to sit down, cousin Robin," she said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And drink some beer with me?<BR>
"No, I will neither eat nor drink,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I am blooded by thee."</P>
<P>"Well, I have a room, cousin Robin," she said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which you did never see;<BR>
And if you please to walk therein,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You blooded by me shall be."</P>
<P>She took him by the lily-white hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And led him to a private room;<BR>
And there she blooded bold Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst one drop of blood would run.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></P>
<P>She blooded him in the vein of the arm,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And locked him up in the room;<BR>
There did he bleed all the live-long day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the next day at noon.</P>
<P>He then bethought him of a casement door,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for to begone;<BR>
He was so weak he could not leap,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor he could not get down.</P>
<P>He then bethought him of his bugle-horn,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hung low down to his knee,<BR>
He set his horn unto his mouth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blew out weak blasts three.</P>
<P>Then Little John, when hearing him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat under the tree,<BR>
I fear my master is near dead,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He blows so wearily."</P>
<P>Then Little John to Fair Kirkley is gone,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fast as he can dree;<BR>
But when he came to Kirkley-hall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke locks two or three;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></P>
<P>Until he came bold Robin to,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he fell on his knee;<BR>
"A boon, a boon," cries Little John,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I beg of thee."</P>
<P>"What is that boon," quoth Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little John, thou begst of me?"<BR>
"It is to burn fair Kirkley-hall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all their nunnery."</P>
<P>"Now nay, now nay," quoth Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"That boon I'll not grant thee;<BR>
I never hurt woman in all my life,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor man in woman's company.</P>
<P>"I never hurt fair maid in all my time,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor at my end shall it be;<BR>
But give me my bent bow in my hand,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a broad arrow I'll let flee;<BR>
And where this arrow is taken up,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall my grave digg&egrave;d be.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Lay me a green sod under my head,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And another under my feet; <A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A><BR>
And lay my bent bow by my side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was my music sweet;<BR>
And make my grave of gravel and green,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is most right and meet.</P>
<P>"Let me have length and breadth enough,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a green sod under my head;<BR>
That they may say when I am dead,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here lies bold Robin Hood."</P>
<P>These words they readily promised him,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which did bold Robin please;<BR>
And there they buried bold Robin Hood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Near to the fair Kirkl&egrave;ys.</P>
