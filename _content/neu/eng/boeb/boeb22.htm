<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>A FAIR maid sat in her bower door,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wringing her lily hands;<BR>
And by it came a sprightly youth,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast tripping o'er the strands.</P>
<P>"Where gang ye, young John," she says,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sae early in the day?<BR>
It gars me think, by your fast trip,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your journey's far away."</P>
<P>He turn'd about wi' surly look,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "What's that to thee?<BR>
I'm ga'en to see a lovely maid,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mair fairer far than ye."</P>

<P>"Now hae ye play'd me this, fause love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In simmer, 'mid the flowers?<BR>
I shall repay ye back again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In winter, 'mid the showers.</P>
<P>"But again, dear love, and again, dear love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will ye not turn again?<BR>
For as ye look to ither women,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall do to other men."</P>
<P>"Make your choice o' whom you please,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I my choice will have;<BR>
I've chosen a maid more fair than thee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never will deceive."</P>
<P>But she's kilt up her claithing fine,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And after him gaed she;<BR>
But aye he said, "Ye'll turn again,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nae farder gae wi' me."</P>
<P>But again, dear love, and again, dear love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will ye never love me again?<BR>
Alas! for loving you sae well,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you na me again."</P>
