<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>As it fell out on a long summer's day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two lovers they sat on a hill;<BR>
They sat together that long summer's day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And could not talk their fill.</P>
<P>"I see no harm by you, Margar&egrave;t,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you see none by mee;<BR>
Before to-morrow at eight o' the clock<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A rich wedding you shall see."</P>
<P>Fair Margaret sat in her bower-wind&ograve;w,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Combing her yellow hair;<BR>
There she spyed sweet William and his bride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they were a riding near.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></P>
<P>Then down she layd her ivory combe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And braided her hair in twain:<BR>
She went alive out of her bower,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But ne'er came alive in't again.</P>
<P>When day was gone, and night was come,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all men fast asleep,<BR>
Then came the spirit of Fair Marg'ret,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood at William's feet.</P>
<P>"Are you awake, sweet William?" shee said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or, sweet William, are you asleep?<BR>
God give you joy of your gay bride-bed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And me of my winding sheet."</P>
<P>When day was come, and night was gone,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all men wak'd from sleep,<BR>
Sweet William to his lady sayd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear, I have cause to weep.</P>
<P>"I dreamt a dream, my dear lady&egrave;,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such dreames are never good:<BR>
I dreamt my bower was full of red 'wine,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my bride-bed full of blood."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Such dreams, such dreams, my honoured sir,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They never do prove good;<BR>
To dream thy bower was full of red 'wine,'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy bride-bed full of blood."</P>
<P>He called up his merry men all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By one, by two, and by three;<BR>
Saying, "I'll away to fair Marg'ret's bower,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the leave of my ladi&egrave;."</P>
<P>And when he came to fair Marg'ret's bower,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked at the ring;<BR>
And who so ready as her seven brethr&egrave;n<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To let sweet William in.</P>
<P>Then he turned up the covering-sheet;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray let me see the dead;<BR>
Methinks she looks all pale and wan.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She hath lost her cherry red.</P>
<P>"I'll do more for thee, Margar&egrave;t,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than any of thy kin:<BR>
For I will kiss thy pale wan lips,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though a smile I cannot win."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></P>
<P>With that bespake the seven brethr&egrave;n,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Making most piteous mone,<BR>
"You may go kiss your jolly brown bride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And let our sister alone."</P>
<P>"If I do kiss my jolly brown bride,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do but what is right;<BR>
I ne'er made a vow to yonder poor corpse,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By day, nor yet by night.</P>
<P>"Deal on, deal on, my merry men all,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deal on your cake and your wine:<BR>
For whatever is dealt at her funeral to-day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be dealt to-morrow at mine."</P>
<P>Fair Margaret dyed to-day, to-day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet William dyed the morrow:<BR>
Fair Margaret dyed for pure true love,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet William dyed for sorrow.</P>
<P>Margaret was buryed in the lower chanc&egrave;l,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And William in the higher:<BR>
Out of her brest there sprang a rose,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of his a briar.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></P>
<P>They grew till they grew unto the church top,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they could grow no higher;<BR>
And there they tyed in a true lover's knot,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which made all the people admire.</P>
<P>Then came the clerk of the parish,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As you the truth shall hear,<BR>
And by misfortune cut them down,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or they had now been there.</P>
