<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Sir Guyon meets the Magician</H3>
<P>ARCHIMAGO, the wicked magician, who had worked such mischief to Una and the Red Cross Knight, was very angry when he found that in the end all his evil wiles were defeated, and that the Knight and the lady were happily betrothed. He would willingly have brought more trouble on them, but he was powerless to do any harm to Una, for she was now safely restored to her own kingdom, and</P>

<P>living in the care of her father and mother. He therefore directed all his spite against the Knight, who had once more to set forth on his adventures, as he had promised Queen Gloriana to serve her faithfully for six years. At the end of that time he hoped to return and marry Una, and the King, her father, had made him heir to the throne.</P>
<P>Archimago, whose other name you may remember was <I>Hypocrisy</I>, set all his wits to work to see what harm he could do the Knight, for he knew that, after all the troubles he had fallen into, he would be more than usually careful. He kept laying snares for him, and placed spies wherever he went, but the Knight had now become so wise and wary that he always found out and shunned the danger. Archimago, however, still kept on hoping he should find some way to hurt him, and at last his opportunity came.</P>
<P>It happened, one day, that the enchanter saw marching to meet him a noble knight. The stranger was clad in shining armour and rode a splendid war-horse; his bearing was very stately, and his face, although calm and beautiful, was so stern and noble that all his friends loved him and his foes feared him. He was one of the chief knights of Queen Gloriana's court, a man of great honour and power in his native land. His name was Sir Guyon.</P>
<P>As the Red Cross Knight was known as the Champion of <I>Holiness</I>, so Sir Guyon was known as the Knight of <I>Temperance</I>.</P>
<P>With him now there was an aged palmer or pilgrim, clad in black; his hair was grey and he leant on a staff. To judge by his look he was a wise and grave old</P>
<P><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></P>
<P>man, and he seemed to be acting as guide to the Knight, who carefully checked his prancing horse to keep pace with his slow footsteps.</P>
<P>The name of the black palmer was <I>Conscience</I>, and he went with Sir Guyon as his companion and adviser, somewhat in the same fashion as <I>Prudence</I> had gone as servant with the Red Cross Knight.</P>
<P>When Archimago saw Sir Guyon, he immediately stopped him, just as on a former occasion he had stopped the Red Cross Knight.</P>
<P>This time he had a fresh story to tell, which, of course, was perfectly false. He implored Sir Guyon to come to the help of a beautiful maiden, cruelly ill-treated by a rough knight, who had cut off her golden locks, and threatened to kill her with his sharp sword.</P>
<P>"What!" cried Sir Guyon, his gentle nature roused to indignation, "is the man still alive who could do such a deed?"</P>
<P>"He is alive, and boasts of it," said wicked Hypocrisy. "Nor has any other knight yet punished him for it."</P>
<P>"Take me to him at once," said Sir Guyon.</P>
<P>"That I can easily do," said Archimago. "I will show you where he is," and he hurried off in high glee, because he thought that at last he had found a way of revenging himself on the Red Cross Knight.</P>
