### CHAPTER IV

### THE VARIOUS NEW-YEAR DAYS

WITH regard to the astronomical year it may be stated that each solstice
and equinox has in turn in some country or another, and even in the same
country at different times, been taken as the beginning of the year.

We have, then, to begin with, the following which may be called
*astronomical* years:—

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />

<td data-valign="top"><p>March.<br />

</tbody>
</table>

</div>

Next, if we treat the intermediate points we have found in the same way,
we have the following *vegetation* years:—

</div>

It will have been gathered from [Fig. 7](sac06.htm#img_fig07) that the
temples or cromlechs erected to watch the first sunrise of the
May-November-May year could also perform the same office for the
August-February-August year; and in a

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

stone circle the priests, by looking along the axis almost in an
opposite direction, could note the sunsets marking the completion of the
half of the sun's yearly round in November and February.

Now to those who know anything of the important contributions of Grimm,
Rhŷs, Frazer, and many others we might name, to our knowledge of the
mythology, worships, and customs in the Mediterranean basin and western
Europe, an inspection of the first columns in the above tables will show
that here we have a common meeting-ground for temple orientation,
vegetation and customs depending on it, religious festivals, and
mythology. From the Egyptian times at least to our own a generic sun-god
has been specifically commemorated in each of the named months. Generic
customs with specific differences are as easily traced in the same
months; while generic vegetation with specific representatives proper to
the season of the year has been so carefully regarded that even
December, though without May flowers or August harvests, not to be
outdone, brings forward its offering in the shape of the berries of the
mistletoe and holly.

About the mistletoe there is this difficulty. Innumerable traditions
associate it with worship and the oak tree. Undoubtedly the year in
question was the solstitial year, so that so far as this goes the
association is justified. But as a rule the mistletoe does not grow on
oaks. This point has been frequently inquired into, especially by Dr.
Henry Ball (*Journal of Botany*, vol. ii. p. 361, 1864) in relation to
the growth of the plant in Herefordshire, and by a writer in the
*Quarterly Review* (vol. cxiv.), who spoke of the mistletoe "deserting
the oak" in modern times and stated, "it is now so rarely

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

found on that tree as to have led to the suggestion that we must look
for the mistletoe of the Druids, not in the *Viscum album* of our own
trees and orchards, but in the *Loranthus Europaeus* which is frequently
found on oaks in the south of Europe."

On this point I consulted two eminent botanical friends, Mr. Murray, of
the British Museum, and Prof. Farmer, from whom I have learned that the
distribution of *V. album* is in Europe universal except north of Norway
and north of Russia; in India in the temperate Himalayas from Kashmir to
Nepaul, altitude 3000 to 7000 feet.

The *Viscum aureum*, otherwise called *Loranthus Europaeus*, is a near
relation of the familiar mistletoe, and in Italy grows on the oak almost
exclusively. There are fifty species of Loranthus in the-Indian flora,
but *L. Europaeus* does not occur.

In the *Viscum aureum* we have the "golden bough," the oak-borne *Aurum
frondens* and *Ramus aureus* of Virgil; and it can easily be imagined
that when the Druids reached our shores from a country which had
supplied them with the *Viscum aureum*, this would be replaced by the
*V. album* growing chiefly on apple trees and not on oaks; indeed, Mr.
Davies, in his "Celtic Researches," tells us that the apple was the next
sacred tree to the oak, and that apple orchards were planted in the
vicinity of the sacred groves. The transplanting of the mistletoe from
the apple to the oak tree before the mystic ceremonies began was not
beyond the resources of priestcraft.

It must not be forgotten that these ceremonies took place at both
solstices—once in June, when the oak was

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

in full leaf, and again in December, when the parasitic plant was better
visible in the light of the young moon. Mr. Frazer, in his "Golden
Bough" (iii. p. 328), points "out that at the summer solstice not only
was mistletoe gathered, but many other "magic plants, whose evanescent
virtue can be secured at this mystic season alone."

It is the ripening of the berries at the winter solstice which secured
for the mistletoe the paramount importance the ceremonials connected
with it possessed at that time, when the rest of the vegetable world was
dormant.

With regard especially to the particular time of the year chosen for
sun-worship and the worship of the gods and solar heroes connected with
the years to which I have referred, I may add that the vague year in
Egyptian chronology makes it a; very difficult matter to determine the
exact Gregorian dates for the ancient Egyptian festivals, but,
fortunately, there is another way of getting at them. Mr. Roland
Mitchell, when compiling his valuable "Egyptian Calendar" (Luzac and
Co., 1900), found that the Koptic calendar really presents to us the old
Egyptian year, "which has been in use for thousands of years, and has
survived all the revolutions."

Of the many festivals included in the calendar, the great Tanta fair,
which is also a Mohammedan feast, "is the most important of all held in
Egypt. Religion, commerce, and pleasure offer combined attractions." As
many as 600,000 or 700,000 often attend this great fair, "no doubt the
survival of one of the ancient Egyptian national festivals."

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

It is held so as to end on a Friday, and in 1901 the Friday was August
9!

This naturally suggests that we should look for a feast in the early
part of May. We find the Festival of Al-Khidr, or Elias in the middle of
the wheat. harvest in Lower Egypt; of this we read:—

"Al-Khidr is a mysterious personage, who, according to learned opinion,
was a just man, or saint, the Visīr of Dhu’l-Karnên (who was a great
conqueror, contemporary with Ibrahīm—Abraham—and identified in other
legends with Alexander the Great, St. George, &c.). Al-Khidr, it is
believed, still lives, and will live until the Day of Judgment. He is
clad in green garments, whence probably the name. He is commonly
identified with Elias (Elijah), and this confusion seems due to a
confusion or similarity of some of the attributes that tradition assigns
to both."

"The 'Festival of El-Khidr and of Elias,' falling generally on May 6,
marks the two-fold division of the year, in the Turkish and Armenian
calendars, into the Rūz Kāsim and the Rūz Khidr (of 179-80 and 185-6
days respectively.")

This last paragraph is important, as it points to ancient sun-worship,
Helios being read for Elias and 179 days from May 6 bring us to November
1. So we find that the modern Turks and Armenians have the old
May-November year as well as the ancient Egyptians who celebrated it in
the Temple of Menu at Thebes.

The traces of the Ptah worship are not so obvious. Finally, it may be
stated that the second Tanta fair occurs at the spring equinox, so that
the pyramid worship can still be traced in the modern Egyptian

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

calendar. The proof that this was an exotic <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2) is established, I think, by the fact that no
important agricultural operations occur at this period in Egypt, while
in May we have the harvest, in August and November sowing, going on.

A cursory examination of Prof. Rhŷs’ book containing the Hibbert
Lectures of 1886, in the light of these years, used as clues, suggests
that in Ireland the sequence was May-November (Fomori and Fir Bolg),
August-February (Lug and the Tuatha Dé Danann), and, lastly,
June–December. (Cúchulainn). Should this be confirmed we see that the
farmers’ years were the first to be established, and it is interesting
to note that the agricultural rent year in many parts of Ireland still
runs from May to November. It is well also to bear in mind, if it be
established that the solstitial year did really arrive last, that the
facts recorded by Mr. Frazer in his "Golden Bough" indicate that the
custom of lighting fires on hills has been in historic times most
prevalent at the summer solstice; evidently maps showing the
geographical distribution of the May, June, and August fires would be of
great value.

Some customs of the May and August years are common to the solstitial
and equinoctial years. Each was ushered in by fires on hills and the
like; flowers in May and the fruits of the earth in August are
associated with them; there are also special customs in the case of
November. In western Europe, however, it does not seem that such
traditions exist over such a

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

large area as that over which the remnants of the solstitial practices
have been traced.

I have pointed out that both the May and August years began when the sun
had the same declination (16° N. or thereabouts); once, on its ascent
from March to the summer solstice in June, again in its decline from the
solstice to September. Hence it may be more difficult in this case to
disentangle and follow the mythology, but the two years stand out here
and there. With regard to August, Mr. Penrose's orientation data for the
Panathenæa fix the 19th day (Gregorian) for the festival in the
Hecatompedon; similar celebrations were not peculiar to western Europe
and Greece, as a comparison of dates of worship will show.

In the above table I have given both the dates on which the sunlight (at
rising or setting) entered the temple, but we do not know for certain,
except in the case of the Hecatompedon, on which of the two days the
temples were used; it is likely they were all used on both days, and
that the variation from the dates proper to the sun's declination of N.
16° indicates that they were very accurately oriented to fit the local
vegetation conditions in the most important and extensive temple fields
in the world.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

This is the more probable because the Jews also, after they had left
Egypt, established their feast of Pentecost fifty days after Easter =
May 10, on which day loaves made of newly harvested corn formed the
chief offering.

With regard to the equinoctial year, the most complete account of the
temple arrangements is to be found in Josephus touching that at
Jerusalem. The temple had to be so erected that at the spring equinox
the sunrise light should fall on, and be reflected to, the worshippers
by the sardonyx stones on the high priest's garment. At this festival
the first barley was laid upon the altar.

But this worship was in full swing in Egypt for thousands of years
before we hear of it in connection with the Jews. It has left its
temples at Ephesus, Athens, and other places, and with the opening of
this year as well as of the solstitial one the custom of lighting fires
is associated, not only on hills, but also in churches.

Here the sequence of cult cannot be mistaken. We begin with Isis and the
young Sun-god Horus at the, Pyramids, and we end with "Lady Day," a
British legal date; while St. Peter's at Rome is as truly oriented to
the equinox as the Pyramids themselves, so that we have a distinct
change of cult with no change of orientation.

If such considerations as these help us to connect Egyptian with British
worships we may hope that they will be no less useful when we go further
afield. I gather from a study of Mr. Maudslay's admirable plans of
Palenque and Chichén-Itzá that the solstitial and

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

farmers’ years’ worships were provided for there. How did these worships
and associated temples with naos and sphinxes <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3) get from Egypt to Yucatan? The more we know
of ancient travel the more we are convinced that it was coastwise, that
is, from one point of visible land to the next. Are the cults as old as
differences in the coast-lines which would most easily explain their
wide distribution?

equinox was the critical time of the year because the Tigris and
Euphrates then began to rise.
