### INTRODUCTION

THE writer who would tell again for people of the twentieth century the
legends and stories that delighted the folk of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries finds himself confronted with a vast mass of
material ready to his hand. Unless he exercises a wise discrimination
and has some system of selection, he becomes lost in the mazes of as
enchanted a land,

"Where Truth and Dream walk hand in hand," <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)

as ever bewildered knights of old in days of romance. Down all the dimly
lighted pathways of mediæval literature mystical figures beckon him in
every direction; fairies, goblins, witches, knights and ladies and
giants entice him, and unless, like Theseus of old, he follows closely
his guiding clue, he will find that he reaches no goal, attains to no
clear vision, achieves no quest. He will remain spell-bound, captivated
by the Middle Ages--

"The life, the delight, and the sorrow  
Of troublous and chivalrous years  
That knew not of night nor of morrow,  
Of hopes or of fears.  
The wars and the woes and the glories  
That quicken, and lighten, and rain  
From the clouds of its chronicled stories  
The passion, the pride, and the pain." <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Such a golden clue
to guide the modern seeker through the labyrinths of the mediæval mind
is that which I have tried to suggest in the title "*Hero* Myths and
Legends of the British Race"--the pursuit and representation of the
ideal hero as the mind of Britain and of early and mediæval England
imagined him, together with

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

the study of the characteristics which made this or that particular
person, mythical or legendary, a hero to the century which sang or wrote
about him. The interest goes deeper when we study, not merely

 

"Old heroes who could grandly do  
As they could greatly dare," <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2)

but

"Heroes of our island breed  
And men and women of our British birth." <span
id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Hero-worship
endures for ever while man endures," wrote Thomas Carlyle, and this
fidelity of men to their admiration for great heroes is one of the
surest tokens by which we can judge of their own character. Such as the
hero is, such will his worshippers be; and the men who idolised Robin
Hood will be found to have been men who were themselves in revolt
against oppressive law, or who, finding law powerless to prevent
tyranny, glorified the lawless punishment of wrongs and the bold
denunciation of perverted justice. The warriors who listened to the saga
of Beowulf looked on physical prowess as the best of all heroic
qualities, and the Normans who admired Roland saw in him the ideal of
feudal loyalty. To every age, and to every nation, there is a peculiar
ideal of heroism, and in the popular legends of each age this ideal may
be found.

Again, these legends give not only the hero as he seemed to his age;
they also show the social life, the virtues and vices, the superstitions
and beliefs, of earlier ages embedded in the tradition, as fossils are
found in the uplifted strata of some ancient ocean-bed. They have ceased
to live; but they remain, tokens of a life long past. So in the
hero-legends of our nation we

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

may find traces of the thoughts and religions of our ancestors many
centuries ago; traces which lie close to one another in these romances,
telling of the nations who came to these Islands of the West, settled,
were conquered and driven away to make room for other races whose
supremacy has been as brief, till all these superimposed races have
blended into one, to form the British nation, the most widespread race
of modern times. For

"Britain's might and Britain's right  
And the brunt of British spears" <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4)

are not the boast of the English race alone. No man in England now can
boast of unmixed descent, but must perforce trace his family back
through many a marriage of Frank, and Norman, and Saxon, and Dane, and
Roman, and Celt, and even Iberian, back to prehistoric man

"Scot and Celt and Norman and Dane,  
With the Northman's sinew and heart and brain,  
And the Northman's courage for blessing or bane,  
Are England's heroes too." <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When Tennyson sang
his greeting at the coming of Alexandra,

"Saxon or Dane or Norman we,  
Teuton or Celt or whatever we be,"

he was only recognising a truth which no boast of pure birth can
cover--the truth that the modern Englishman is a compound of many races,
with many characteristics; and if we would understand him, we must seek
the clue to the riddle in early England and Scotland and Ireland and
Wales, while even France adds her

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

share of enlightenment towards the solution of the riddle.

"The Saxon force, the Celtic fire,  
These are thy manhood's heritage." <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6)

Britain, as far as we can trace men in our island, was first inhabited
by cavemen, who have left no history at all. In the course of ages they
passed away before the Iberians or Ivernians, who came from the east,
and bore a striking resemblance to the Basques. It may be that some
Mongolian tribe, wandering west, drawn by the instinct which has driven
most race-migrations westward, sent offshoots north and south--one to
brave the dangers of the sea and inhabit Britain and Ireland, one to
cross the Pyrenees and remain sheltered in their deep ravines; or it may
be that Basques from the Pyrenees, daring the storms of the Bay of
Biscay in their frail coracles, ventured to the shores of Britain. Short
and dark were these sturdy voyagers, harsh-featured and long-headed,
worshipping the powers of Nature with mysterious and cruel rites of
human sacrifice, holding beliefs in totems and ancestor-worship and in
the superiority of high descent claimed through the mother to that
claimed through the father. When the stronger and more civilised Celt
came he drove before him these little dark men, he enslaved their
survivors or wedded their women, and in his turn fell into slavery to
the cruel Druidic religion of his subjects. To these Iberians, and to
the Celtic dread of them, we probably owe all the stories of dwarfs,
goblins, elves, and earth-gnomes which fill our fairy-tale books; and if
we examine carefully the descriptions of the abodes of these beings we
shall find them not inconsistent with the earth-dwellings, caves, circle
huts, or even with the burial mounds, of the Iberian race.

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

The race that followed the Iberians, and drove them out or subdued them,
so that they served as slaves where they had once ruled as lords, was
the proud Aryan Celtic race. Of different tribes, Gaels, Brythons, and
Belgæ, they were all one in spirit, and one in physical feature.

Tall, blue-eyed, with fair or red hair, they overpowered in every way
the diminutive Iberians, and their tattooing, while it gave them a name
which has often been mistaken for a national designation (Picts, or
painted men), made them dreadful to their enemies in battle, and
ferocious-looking even in time of peace. Their civilisation was of a
much higher type than that of the Iberians; their weapons, their
war-chariots, their mode of life and their treatment of women, are all
so closely similar to that of the Greeks of Homer that a theory has been
advanced and ably defended, that the Homeric Greeks were really invading
Celts--Gaelic or Gaulish tribes from the north of Europe. If it indeed
be so, we owe to the Celts a debt of imperishable culture and
civilisation. To them belongs more especially, in our national amalgam,
the passion for the past, the ardent patriotism, the longing for
spiritual beauty, which raises and relieves the Saxon materialism.

"Though fallen the state of Erin and changed the Scottish land,  
Though small the power of Mona, though unwaked Llewellyn's band,  
Though Ambrose Merlin's prophecies are held as idle tales,  
Though Iona's ruined cloisters are swept by northern gales,  
                  One in name and in fame  
                  Are the sea-divided Gaels.

"In Northern Spain and Italy our brethren also dwell,  
And brave are the traditions of their fathers that they tell;  
The Eagle or the Crescent in the dawn of history pales  
Before the advancing banners of the great Rome-conquering Gaels:  
                  One in name and in fame  
                  Are the sea-divided Gaels." <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is almost
impossible to overestimate the value of the Celtic contribution to our
national literature and character: the race that gave us Ossian, and
Finn, and Cuchulain, that sang of the sorrowful love and doom of
Deirdre, that told of the pursuit of Diarmit and Grania, till every
dolmen and cromlech in Ireland was associated with these lovers; the
race that preserved for us

"That grey king whose name, a ghost,  
Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain-peak  
And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still," <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8)

the King Arthur whose Arthur's Seat overhangs Edinburgh, whose presence
haunts the Lakes, and Wales, and Cornwall, and the forests of Brittany;
the race that held up for us the image of the Holy Grail--that race can
claim no small share in the moulding of the modern Briton.

The Celt, however, had his day of supremacy and passed: the Roman
crushed his power of initiative and made him helpless and dependent, and
the Teuton, whether as Saxon, Angle, Frisian, or Jute, dwelt in his
homes and ruled as slaves the former owners of the land. These
new-comers were not physically unlike the Celts whom they dispossessed.
Tall and fair, grey-eyed and sinewy, the Teuton was a hardier, more
sturdy warrior than the Celt: he had not spent centuries of quiet
settlement and imitative civilisation under the ægis of Imperial Rome:
he had not learnt to love the arts of peace and he cultivated none but
those of war; he was by choice a warrior and a sailor, a wanderer to
other lands, a plougher of the desolate places of the "vasty deep," yet
withal a lover of home, who trod at times, with bitter longing for his
native land, the thorny paths of exile. To him physical cowardice was

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

the unforgivable sin, next to treachery to his lord; for the loyalty of
thane to his chieftain was a very deep and abiding reality to the
Anglo-Saxon warrior, and in the early poems of our English race, love
for "his dear lord, his chieftain-friend," takes the place of that love
of woman which other races felt and expressed. A quiet death-bed was the
worst end to a man's life, in the Anglo-Saxon's creed; it was "a cow's
death," to be shunned by every means in a man's power; while a death in
fight, victor or vanquished, was a worthy finish to a warrior's life.
There was no fear of death itself in the English hero's mind, nor of
Fate; the former was the inevitable,

"Seeing that Death, a necessary end,  
Will come when it will come," <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9)

and the latter a goddess whose decrees must needs be obeyed with proud
submission, but not with meek acceptance. Perhaps there was little of
spiritual insight in the minds of these Angles and Saxons, little love
of beauty, little care for the amenities of life; but they had a sturdy
loyalty, an uprightness, a brave disregard of death in the cause of
duty, which we can still recognise in modern Englishmen. To the Saxon
belong the tales where

"The warrior kings,  
In height and prowess more than human, strive  
Again for glory, while the golden lyre  
Is ever sounding in heroic ears  
Heroic hymns." <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10)

When the English (Anglo-Saxons, as we generally call them) had settled
down in England, had united their warring tribes, and developed a
somewhat centralised

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

government, their whole national existence was imperilled by the
incursions of the Danes. Kindred folk to the Anglo-Saxons were these
Danes, these Vikings from Christiania Wik, these Northmen from Norway or
Iceland, whose fame went before them, and the dread of whom inspired the
petition in the old Litany of the Church, "From the fury of the
Northmen, good Lord, deliver us!" Their fair hair and blue or grey eyes,
their tall and muscular frames, bore testimony to their kinship with the
races they harried and plundered, but their spirit was different from
that of the conquered Teutonic tribes. The Viking *loved* the sea; it
was his summer home, his field of war and profit. To go
"a-summer-harrying" was the usual employment of the true Viking, and in
the winter only could he enjoy domestic life and the pleasures of the
family circle. The rapturous fight with the elements, in which the
Northman lived and moved and had his being, gave him a strain of
ruthless cruelty unlike anything in the more peaceful Anglo-Saxon
character: his disregard of death for himself led to a certain
callousness with regard to human life, and to a certain enjoyment in
inflicting physical anguish. There was an element of Red Indian
ruthlessness in the Viking, which looms large in the story of the years
of Norse ascendancy over Western Europe. Yet there was also a power of
bold and daring action, of reckless valour, of rapid conception and
execution, which contrasted strongly with the slower and more placid
temperament of the Anglo-Saxon, and to this Danish strain modern
Englishmen probably owe the power of initiative, the love of adventure,
and the daring action which have made England the greatest colonising
nation on the earth. The Danish, Norse, or Viking element spread far and
wide in mediaeval Europe--Iceland, Normandy (Northman's

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Land), the Isle of
Man, the Hebrides, the east of Ireland, the Danelagh of East Anglia, and
the Cumberland dales all show traces of the conquering Danish race; and
raider after raider came to England and stayed, until half of our island
was Danish, and even our royal family became for a time one with the
royal line of Denmark. The acceptance of Christianity by the Danes in
England when Guthrum was baptized rendered much more easy their
amalgamation with the English; but it was not so in Ireland, where the
Round Towers still stand to show (as some authorities hold) how the
terrified native Irish sheltered from the Danish fury which nearly
destroyed the whole fabric of Irish Christianity. The legends of
Ireland, too, are full of the terror of the men of "Lochlann," which is
generally taken to mean Norway; and the great coast cities of
Ireland--Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Wexford, and others--were so entirely
Danish that only the decisive battle of Clontarf, in which the saintly
and victorious Brian Boru was slain, saved Ireland to Christendom and
curbed the power of the heathen invaders.

A second wave of Norse invasion swept over England at the Norman
Conquest, and for a time submerged the native English population. The
chivalrous Norman knights who followed William of Normandy's sacred
banner, whether from religious zeal or desire of plunder, were as truly
Vikings by race as were the Danes who settled in the Danelagh. The days
when Rolf (Rollo, or Rou), the Viking chief, won Normandy were not yet
so long gone by that the fierce piratical instincts of his followers had
ceased to influence their descendants: piety and learning, feudal law
and custom, had made some impression upon the character of the Norman,
but at heart he was still a Northman. The Norman barons fought for their
independence against Duke William

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

with all the determination of those Norse chiefs who would not
acknowledge the overlordship of Harold Fairhair, but fled to colonise
Iceland when he made himself King of Norway. The seafaring instincts
which drove the Vikings to harry other lands in like manner drove the
Normans to piratical plundering up and down the English Channel, and,
when they had settled in England, led to continual sea-fights in the
Channel between English and French, hardy Kentish and Norman, or Cornish
and Breton, sailors, with a common strain of fighting blood, and a
common love of the sea.

The Norman Conquest of England was but one instance of Norman activity:
Sicily, Italy, Constantinople, even Antioch, and the Holy Land itself,
showed in time Norman states, Norman laws, Norman civilisation, and all
alike felt the impulse of Norman energy and inspiration. England lay
ready to hand for Norman invasion--the hope of peaceable succession to
the saintly Edward the Confessor had to be abandoned by William; the
gradual permeation of sluggish England with Norman earls, churchmen,
courtiers, had been comprehended and checked by Earl Godwin and his sons
(themselves of Danish race); but there still remained the way or open
war and an appeal to religious zeal; and this way William took. There
was genius as well as statesman-ship in the idea of combining a personal
claim to the throne held by Harold the usurper with a crusading summons
against the schismatic and heretical English, who refused obedience to
the true successor of St. Peter. The success of the idea was its
justification: the success of the expedition proved the need that
England had of some new leaven to energise the sluggish temperament of
her sons. The Norman Conquest not only revived and quickened, but
unified and solidified the English nation. The tyranny of the Norman
nobles,

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

held in check at first only by the tyranny of the Norman king, was the
factor in mediæval English life that made for a national consciousness;
it also helped the appreciation of the heroism of revolt against tyranny
which is seen in Hereward the Wake, in Robin Hood, in William of
Cloudeslee, and in many other English hero-rebels; but it gradually led
men to, a realization of their own rights as Englishmen. When all men
alike felt themselves sons of England, the days were past when Norman
and Saxon were aliens to each other, and Norman robber soon became as
truly English as Danish viking, Anglo-Saxon seafarer, or Celtic settler.
Then the full value of the Norman infusion was seen in quicker
intellectual apprehension, nimbler wit, a keener sense of reverence, a
more spiritual piety, a more refined courtesy, and a more enlightened
perception of the value of law. The materialism of the original Saxon
race was successively modified by many influences, and not least of
these was the Norman Conquest.

From the Norman Conquest onward England has welcomed men of many
nations--French, Flemings, Germans, Dutch: men brought by war, by trade,
by love of adventure, by religion; traders, refugees, exiles, all have
found in her a hospitable shelter and a second home, and all have come
to love the "grey old mother" that counted them among her sons and grew
to think them her own in very truth.

Geographically, also, we must recognise the admixture of races in our
islands. The farthest western borders show most strongly the type of man
whom we can imagine the Iberian to have been: Western Ireland, the
Hebrides, Central and South Wales, and Cornwall are still inhabited by
folk of Iberian descent. The blue-eyed Celt yet dwells in the Highlands
and the greater part of Wales and the Marches--Hereford and Shropshire,

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

and as far as Worcestershire and Cheshire; still the Dales of
Cumberland, the Fen Country, East Anglia, and the Isle of Man show
traces of Danish blood, speech, manners, and customs; still the slow,
stolid Saxon inhabits the lands south of the Thames from Sussex to
Hampshire and Dorset. The Angle has settled permanently over the
Lowlands of Scotland, with the Celt along the western fringe, and
Flemish blood shows its traces in Pembroke on the one side ("Little
England beyond Wales") and in Norfolk on the other.

With all these nations, all these natures, amalgamated in our own, it is
no wonder that the literature of our isles contains many different
ideals of heroism, changing according to nationality and epoch. Thus the
physical valour of Beowulf is not the same quality as the valour of
Havelok the Dane, though both are heroes of the strong arm; and the
chivalry of Diarmit is not the same as the chivalry of Roland. Again,
religion has its share in changing the ideals of a nation, and
Constantine, the warrior of the Early English poem of "Elene," is far
from being the same in character as the tender-hearted Constantine of
"moral Gower's" apocryphal tale. The law-abiding nature of the earliest
heroes, whose obedience to their king and their priest was absolute,
differs almost entirely from the lawlessness of Gamelyn and Robin Hood,
both of whom set church and king at defiance, and even account it a
merit to revolt from the rule of both. It follows from this that we
shall find our chosen heroes of very different types and characters; but
we shall recognise that each represented to his own age an ideal of
heroism, which that age loved sufficiently to put into literature, and
perpetuate by the best means in its power. Of many another hero besides
Arthur--of Barbarossa, of Hiawatha, even of Napoleon--has the tradition
grown that

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

he is not dead, but has passed away into the deathless land, whence he
shall come again in his own time. As Tennyson has sung,

            "Great bards of him will sing  
Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old  
Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,  
And echoed by old folk beside their fires  
For comfort after their wage-work is done,  
Speak of the King."
