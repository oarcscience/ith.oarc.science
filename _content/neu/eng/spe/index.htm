<P>This book is a key source for information on leisure time activities
in 'Olde England,' including sports, hunting, games,
dancing, gymnastics, music, festivals including Christmas and May Day
and customs such as Mumming, The Boy Bishop, and The Lord of Misrule.
It answers questions such as "How do you score a joust?,"
(<A HREF="spe11.htm#page_125">p. 125</A>)
"When did feral wolves become extinct in Britain?,"
(<A HREF="spe05.htm#page_12">p. 12</A>)
and "How much <I>do</I> you pay the piper?"
(<A HREF="spe13.htm#page_164">p. 164</A>)
And what is Shakespeare talking about when
he mentions Shove-Groat (<A HREF="spe18.htm#page_242">p. 242</A>)
or Nine Men's Morris (<A HREF="spe19.htm#page_256">p. 256</A>)?
(The modern equivalents are shuffleboard and tic-tac-toe).
Included are numerous quotes from original documents and dozens of
plates based on period illustrations.</P>
<P>
Strutt documents the constant conflict between popular culture and
the religious and secular powers.
The 'culture war' has been going on long before modern attempts to censor
videos, computer games and comic books.
In 1579, under Queen Elizabeth, a Puritan writer (John Northbrooke)
branded playing cards "an invention of the devill"
(<A HREF="spe19.htm#page_261">p. 261</A>), and 
complained (<A HREF="spe12.htm#page_138">p. 138</A>)
"Many can tary at a vayne
Playe for two or three hours, when as they will not abide scarce one houre
at a Sermon."
There was a class element to this as well, with an open double standard.
In 1541, a statute forbade the lower classes from bowling
and other games except under certain closely supervised circumstances;
however, nobles could obtain a license to bowl on their own land
(<A HREF="spe17.htm#page_217">p. 217</A>).
Likewise, football (<A HREF="spe10.htm#page_96">p. 96</A>)
and tennis (<A HREF="spe10.htm#page_85">p. 85</A>) were at times
forbidden to everyone--except the upper class.

Production notes: Since English spelling was still in a state of flux when
this book was originally published in 1801, and the book quotes from many
older documents, spelling varies widely in the body of the text. I have
left these spellings intact.
The asterisks which appear in front of many of the paragraphs were in the
original book and do not indicate footnotes; rather,
they indicate material added in the second edition.
