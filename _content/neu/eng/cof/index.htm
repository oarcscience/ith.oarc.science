Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes,
in his later years became attracted to spiritualism and occult topics.
This was after the death of his son Raymond during World War I.
While researching the topic of fairies, some photographs from
a working-class family in rural Yorkshire were brought to Doyle's attention
by a Theosophist friend.
These photographs appeared to show diminutive fairies cavorting in the
presence of humans, specifically two teenage girls, Elsie and Frances.
They had taken the photographs by themselves, and there were no
overt signs that the negatives had been tampered with.
Doyle championed the photographs, and in the process destroyed
his reputation; which is probably why this book, out of all of the Doyle
corpus, has not been put into etext until now.
<CITE>The Coming of the Fairies</CITE> was possibly a bigger disappointment 
for Doyle fans than when he killed off Sherlock Holmes.
</P>
<P>
These photographs, which caused a sensation at the time, are
easily recognizable as blatant fakes by modern eyes, sensitized to seeing
much more photorealistic computer-generated elves and fairies.
The fairies are statically posed, and are neatly coiffed and
dressed in period clothing, hardly what one would expect from wild
nature-elementals.
They are just too flat-looking and high contrast to be anything other than 
cardboard cutouts positioned in the scene, and could be
constructed by adolescent girls with artistic leanings.
And indeed, many years later the pair did admit that they had faked the photos.
</P>
<P>
However, even a skeptic will have to admit that 
just because these photos are fake, it does not logically
imply there are no such beings.
Just because some UFO photos are fake, doesn't mean that there are no UFOs!
But 'extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof'.
While we may not have extraordinary proof of fairies,
there is more to the phenomena than meets the eye.
Enough data that <I>some</I> explanation must be attempted.
Doyle barely scratches the surface of the massive literature on
fairies here; for a comprehensive survey, for instance,
refer to Evan-Wentz'
<A HREF="../../celt/ffcc/index">The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries</A>.
The real reason that this charming little book is of interest today is
historical, and of course, because of the author.
