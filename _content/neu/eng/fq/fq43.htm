<blockquote>
<i>Satyrane makes a Turneyment<br>
For loue of Florimell:<br>
Britomart winnes the prize from all,<br>
And Artegall doth quell.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
I
T often fals, (as here it earst befell)<br>
That mortall foes doe turne to faithfull frends,<br>
And friends profest are chaungd to foemen fell:<br>
The cause of both, of both their minds depends;<br>
And th'end of both likewise of both their ends.<br>
For enmitie, that of no ill proceeds,<br>
But of occasion, with th'occasion ends;<br>
And friendship, which a faint affection breeds<br>
Without regard of good, dyes like ill grounded seeds.<p>

That well (me seemes) appeares, by that of late<br>
Twixt <i>Cambell</i> and Sir <i>Triamond</i> befell,<br>
As als by this, that now a new debate<br>
Stird vp twixt <i>Scudamour</i> and <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
The which by course befals me here to tell:<br>
Who hauing those two other Knights espide,<br>
Marching afore, as ye remember well,<br>
Sent forth their Squire to haue them both descride,<br>
And eke those masked Ladies riding them beside.<p>

Who backe returning, told as he had seene,<br>
That they were doughtie knights of dreaded name;<br>
And those two Ladies, their two loues vnseene;<br>
And therefore wisht them without blot or blame,<br>
To let them passe at will, for dread of shame.<br>
But <i>Blandamour</i> full of vainglorious spright,<br>
And rather stird by his discordfull Dame,<br>
Vpon them gladly would haue prov'd his might,<br>
But that he yet was sore of his late lucklesse fight.<p>

Yet nigh approching, he them fowle bespake,<br>
Disgracing them, him selfe thereby to grace,<br>
As was his wont; so weening way to make<br>
To Ladies loue, where so he came in place,<br>
And with lewd termes their louers to deface.<br>
Whose sharpe prouokement them incenst so sore,<br>
That both were bent t'auenge his vsage base,<br>
And gan their shields addresse them selues afore:<br>
For euill deedes may better then bad words be bore.<p>

But faire <i>Cambina</i> with perswasions myld,<br>
Did mitigate the fiercenesse of their mode,<br>
That for the present they were reconcyld,<br>
And gan to treate of deeds of armes abrode,<br>
And strange aduentures, all the way they rode:<br>
Amongst the which they told, as then befell,<br>
Of that great turney, which was blazed brode,<br>
For that rich girdle of faire <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
The prize of her, which did in beautie most excell.<p>

To which folke-mote they all with one consent,<br>
Sith each of them his Ladie had him by,<br>
Whose beautie each of them thought excellent,<br>
Agreed to trauell, and their fortunes try.<br>
So as they passed forth, they did espy<br>
One in bright armes, with ready speare in rest,<br>
That toward them his course seem'd to apply,<br>
Gainst whom Sir <i>Paridell</i> himselfe addrest,<br>
Him weening, ere he nigh approcht to haue represt.<p>

Which th'other seeing, gan his course relent,<br>
And vaunted speare eftsoones to disaduaunce,<br>
As if he naught but peace and pleasure ment,<br>
Now falne into their fellowship by chance,<br>
Whereat they shewed curteous countenaunce.<br>
So as he rode with them accompanide,<br>
His rouing eie did on the Lady glaunce,<br>
Which <i>Blandamour</i> had riding by his side:<br>
Who&tilde; sure he weend, that he some wher tofore had eide.<p>

It was to weete that snowy <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
Which <i>Ferrau</i> late from <i>Braggadochio</i> wonne,<br>
Whom he now seeing, her remembred well,<br>
How hauing reft her from the witches sonne,<br>
He soone her lost: wherefore he now begunne<br>
To challenge her anew, as his owne prize,<br>
Whom formerly he had in battell wonne,<br>
And proffer made by force her to reprize:<br>
Which scornefull offer, <i>Blandamour</i> gan soone despize.<p>

And said, Sir Knight, sith ye this Lady clame,<br>
Whom he that hath, were loth to lose so light,<br>
(For so to lose a Lady, were great shame)<br>
Yee shall her winne, as I haue done in fight:<br>
And lo shee shall be placed here in sight,<br>
Together with this Hag beside her set,<br>
That who so winnes her, may her haue by right:<br>
But he shall haue the Hag that is ybet,<br>
And with her alwaies ride, till he another get.<p>

That offer pleased all the company,<br>
So <i>Florimell</i> with <i>Ate</i> forth was brought,<br>
At which they all gan laugh full merrily:<br>
But <i>Braggadochio</i> said, he neuer thought<br>
For such an Hag, that seemed worse then nought,<br>
His person to emperill so in fight.<br>
But if to match that Lady they had sought<br>
Another like, that were like faire and bright,<br>
His life he then would spend to iustifie his right.<p>

At which his vaine excuse they all gan smile,<br>
As scorning his vnmanly cowardize:<br>
And <i>Florimell</i> him fowly gan reuile,<br>
That for her sake refus'd to enterprize<br>
The battell, offred in so knightly wize.<br>
And <i>Ate</i> eke prouokt him priuily,<br>
With loue of her, and shame of such mesprize.<br>
But naught he car'd for friend or enemy,<br>
For in base mind nor friendship dwels nor enmity.<p>

But <i>Cambell</i> thus did shut vp all in iest,<br>
Braue Knights and Ladies, certes ye doe wrong<br>
To stirre vp strife, when most vs needeth rest,<br>
That we may vs reserue both fresh and strong,<br>
Against the Turneiment which is not long.<br>
When who so list to fight, may fight his fill,<br>
Till then your challenges ye may prolong;<br>
And then it shall be tried, if ye will,<br>
Whether shall haue the Hag, or hold the Lady still.<p>

They all agreed: so turning all to game,<br>
And pleasaunt bord, they past forth on their way,<br>
And all that while, where so they rode or came,<br>
That masked Mock-knight was their sport and play.<br>
Till that at length vpon th'appointed day,<br>
Vnto the place of turneyment they came;<br>
Where they before them found in fresh aray<br>
Manie a braue knight, and manie a daintie dame<br>
Assembled, for to get the honour of that game.<p>

There this faire crewe arriuing, did diuide<br>
Them selues asunder: <i>Blandamour</i> with those<br>
Of his, on th'one; the rest on th'other side.<br>
But boastfull <i>Braggadocchio</i> rather chose,<br>
For glorie vaine their fellowship to lose,<br>
That men on him the more might gaze alone.<br>
The rest them selues in troupes did else dispose,<br>
Like as it seemed best to euery one;<br>
The knights in couples marcht, with ladies linckt attone.<p>

Then first of all forth came Sir <i>Satyrane</i>,<br>
Bearing that precious relicke in an arke<br>
Of gold, that bad eyes might it not prophane:<br>
Which drawing softly forth out of the darke,<br>
He open shewd, that all men it mote marke.<br>
A gorgeous girdle, curiously embost<br>
With pearle &amp; precious stone, worth many a marke;<br>
Yet did the workmanship farre passe the cost:<br>
It was the same, which lately <i>Florimel</i> had lost.<p>

That same aloft he hong in open vew,<br>
To be the prize of beautie and of might;<br>
The which eftsoones discouered, to it drew<br>
The eyes of all, allur'd with close delight,<br>
And hearts quite robbed with so glorious sight,<br>
That all men threw out vowes and wishes vaine.<br>
Thrise happie Ladie, and thrise happie knight,<br>
Them seemd, that could so goodly riches gaine,<br>
So worthie of the perill, worthy of the paine.<p>

Then tooke the bold Sir <i>Satyrane</i> in hand<br>
An huge great speare, such as he wont to wield,<br>
And vauncing forth from all the other band<br>
Of knights, addrest his maiden-headed shield,<br>
Shewing him selfe all ready for the field.<br>
Gainst whom there singled from the other side<br>
A Painim knight, that well in armes was skild,<br>
And had in many a battell oft bene tride,<br>
Hight <i>Bruncheual</i> the bold, who fiersly forth did ride.<p>

So furiously they both together met,<br>
That neither could the others force sustaine;<br>
As two fierce Buls, that striue the rule to get<br>
Of all the heard, meete with so hideous maine,<br>
That both rebutted, tumble on the plaine:<br>
So these two champions to the ground were feld,<br>
Where in a maze they both did long remaine,<br>
And in their hands their idle troncheons held,<br>
Which neither able were to wag, or once to weld.<p>

Which when the noble <i>Ferramont</i> espide,<br>
He pricked forth in ayd of <i>Satyran</i>;<br>
And him against Sir <i>Blandamour</i> did ride<br>
With all the strength and stifnesse that he can.<br>
But the more strong and stiffely that he ran,<br>
So much more sorely to the ground he fell,<br>
That on an heape were tumbled horse and man.<br>
Vnto whose rescue forth rode <i>Paridell</i>;<br>
But him likewise with that same speare he eke did quell.<p>

Which <i>Braggadocchio</i> seeing, had no will<br>
To hasten greatly to his parties ayd,<br>
Albee his turne were next; but stood there still,<br>
As one that seemed doubtfull or dismayd.<br>
But <i>Triamond</i> halfe wroth to see him staid,<br>
Sternly stept forth, and raught away his speare,<br>
With which so sore he <i>Ferramont</i> assaid,<br>
That horse and man to ground he quite did beare,<br>
That neither could in hast themselues againe vpreare.<p>

Which to auenge, Sir <i>Deuon</i> him did dight,<br>
But with no better fortune then the rest:<br>
For him likewise he quickly downe did smight,<br>
And after him Sir <i>Douglas</i> him addrest,<br>
And after him Sir <i>Paliumord</i> forth prest,<br>
But none of them against his strokes could stand,<br>
But all the more, the more his praise increst.<br>
For either they were left vppon the land,<br>
Or went away sore wounded of his haplesse hand.<p>

And now by this, Sir <i>Satyrane</i> abraid,<br>
Out of the swowne, in which too long he lay;<br>
And looking round about, like one dismaid,<br>
When as he saw the mercilesse affray<br>
Which doughty <i>Triamond</i> had wrought that day,<br>
Vnto the noble Knights of Maidenhead,<br>
His mighty heart did almost rend in tway,<br>
For very gall, that rather wholly dead<br>
Himselfe he wisht haue beene, then in so bad a stead.<p>

Eftsoones he gan to gather vp around<br>
His weapons, which lay scattered all abrode,<br>
And as it fell, his steed he ready found.<br>
On whom remounting, fiercely forth he rode,<br>
Like sparke of fire that from the anduile glode.<br>
There where he saw the valiant <i>Triamond</i><br>
Chasing, and laying on them heauy lode,<br>
That none his force were able to withstond,<br>
So dreadfull were his strokes, so deadly was his hond.<p>

With that, at him his beam-like speare he aimed,<br>
And thereto all his power and might applide:<br>
The wicked steele for mischiefe first ordained,<br>
And hauing now misfortune got for guide,<br>
Staid not, till it arriued in his side.<br>
And therein made a very griesly wound,<br>
That streames of bloud his armour all bedide.<br>
Much was he daunted with that direfull stound,<br>
That scarse he him vpheld from falling in a sound.<p>

Yet as he might, himselfe he soft withdrew<br>
Out of the field, that none perceiu'd it plaine.<br>
Then gan the part of Chalengers anew<br>
To range the field, and victorlike to raine,<br>
That none against them battell durst maintaine.<br>
By that the gloomy euening on them fell,<br>
That forced them from fighting to refraine,<br>
And trumpets sound to cease did them compell.<br>
So <i>Satyrane</i> that day was iudg'd to beare the bell.<p>

The morrow next the Turney gan anew,<br>
And with the first the hardy <i>Satyrane</i><br>
Appear'd in place, with all his noble crew:<br>
On th'other side, full many a warlike swaine,<br>
Assembled were, that glorious prize to gaine.<br>
But mongst them all, was not Sir <i>Triamond</i>,<br>
Vnable he new battell to darraine,<br>
Through grieuaunce of his late receiued wound,<br>
That doubly did him grieue, when so himselfe he found.<p>

Which <i>Cambell</i> seeing, though he could not salue,<br>
Ne done vndoe, yet for to salue his name,<br>
And purchase honour in his friends behalue,<br>
This goodly counterfesaunce he did frame.<br>
The shield and armes well knowne to be the same,<br>
Which <i>Triamond</i> had worne, vnwares to wight,<br>
And to his friend vnwist, for doubt of blame,<br>
If he misdid, he on himselfe did dight,<br>
That none could him discerne, and so went forth to fight.<p>

There <i>Satyrane</i> Lord of the field he found,<br>
Triumphing in great ioy and iolity;<br>
Gainst whom none able was to stand on ground;<br>
That much he gan his glorie to enuy,<br>
And cast t'auenge his friends indignity.<br>
A mightie speare eftsoones at him he bent;<br>
Who seeing him come on so furiously,<br>
Met him mid-way with equall hardiment,<br>
That forcibly to ground they both together went.<p>

They vp againe them selues can lightly reare,<br>
And to their tryed swords them selues betake;<br>
With which they wrought such wondrous maruels there,<br>
That all the rest it did amazed make,<br>
Ne any dar'd their perill to partake;<br>
Now cuffling close, now chacing to and fro,<br>
Now hurtling round aduantage for to take:<br>
As two wild Boares together grapling go,<br>
Chaufing and foming choler each against his fo.<p>

So as they courst, and turneyd here and theare,<br>
It chaunst Sir <i>Satyrane</i> his steed at last,<br>
Whether through foundring or through sodein feare<br>
To stumble, that his rider nigh he cast;<br>
Which vauntage <i>Cambell</i> did pursue so fast,<br>
That ere him selfe he had recouered well,<br>
So sore he sowst him on the compast creast,<br>
That forced him to leaue his loftie sell,<br>
And rudely tumbling downe vnder his horse feete fell.<p>

Lightly <i>Cambello</i> leapt downe from his steed,<br>
For to haue rent his shield and armes away,<br>
That whylome wont to be the victors meed;<br>
When all vnwares he felt an hideous sway<br>
Of many swords, that lode on him did lay.<br>
An hundred knights had him enclosed round,<br>
To rescue <i>Satyrane</i> out of his pray;<br>
All which at once huge strokes on him did pound,<br>
In hope to take him prisoner, where he stood on ground.<p>

He with their multitude was nought dismayd,<br>
But with stout courage turnd vpon them all,<br>
And with his brondiron round about him layd;<br>
Of which he dealt large almes, as did befall:<br>
Like as a Lion that by chaunce doth fall<br>
Into the hunters toile, doth rage and rore,<br>
In royall heart disdaining to be thrall.<br>
But all in vaine: for what might one do more?<br>
They haue him taken captiue, though it grieue him sore.<p>

Whereof when newes to <i>Triamond</i> was brought,<br>
There as he lay, his wound he soone forgot,<br>
And starting vp, streight for his armour sought:<br>
In vaine he sought; for there he found it not;<br>
<i>Cambello</i> it away before had got:<br>
<i>Cambelloes</i> armes therefore he on him threw,<br>
And lightly issewd forth to take his lot.<br>
There he in troupe found all that warlike crew,<br>
Leading his friend away, full sorie to his vew.<p>

Into the thickest of that knightly preasse<br>
He thrust, and smote downe all that was betweene,<br>
Caried with feruent zeale, ne did he ceasse,<br>
Till that he came, where he had <i>Cambell</i> seene,<br>
Like captive thral two other Knights atweene,<br>
There he amongst them cruell hauocke makes;<br>
That they which lead him, soone enforced beene<br>
To let him loose, to saue their proper stakes;<br>
Who being freed, from one a weapon fiercely takes.<p>

With that he driues at them with dreadfull might,<br>
Both in remembrance of his friends late harme,<br>
And in reuengement of his owne despight,<br>
So both together giue a new allarme,<br>
As if but now the battell wexed warme.<br>
As when two greedy Wolues doe breake by force<br>
Into an heard, farre from the husband farme,<br>
They spoile and rauine without all remorse,<br>
So did these two through all the field their foes enforce.<p>

Fiercely they followd on their bolde emprize,<br>
Till trumpets sound did warne them all to rest;<br>
Then all with one consent did yeeld the prize<br>
To <i>Triamond</i> and <i>Cambell</i> as the best.<br>
But <i>Triamond</i> to <i>Cambell</i> it relest,<br>
And <i>Cambell</i> it to <i>Triamond</i> transferd;<br>
Each labouring t'aduance the others gest,<br>
And make his praise before his owne preferd:<br>
So that the doome was to another day differd.<p>

The last day came, when all those knightes againe<br>
Assembled were their deedes of armes to shew.<br>
Full many deedes that day were shewed plaine:<br>
But <i>Satyrane</i> boue all the other crew,<br>
His wondrous worth declared in all mens view.<br>
For from the first he to the last endured,<br>
And though some while Fortune from him withdrew,<br>
Yet euermore his honour he recured,<br>
And with vnwearied powre his party still assured.<p>

Ne was there Knight that euer thought of armes,<br>
But that his vtmost prowesse there made knowen,<br>
That by their many wounds, and carelesse harmes,<br>
By shiuered speares, and swords all vnder strowen,<br>
By scattered shields was easie to be showen.<br>
There might ye see loose steeds at randon ronne,<br>
Whose luckelesse riders late were ouerthrowen;<br>
And squiers make hast to helpe their Lords fordonne.<br>
But still the Knights of Maidenhead the better wonne.<p>

Till that there entred on the other side,<br>
A straunger knight, from whence no man could reed,<br>
In quyent disguise, full hard to be descride.<br>
For all his armour was like saluage weed,<br>
With woody mosse bedight, and all his steed<br>
With oaken leaues attrapt, that seemed fit<br>
For saluage wight, and thereto well agreed<br>
His word, which on his ragged shield was writ,<br>
<i>Saluagesse sans finesse</i>, shewing secret wit.<p>

He at his first incomming, charg'd his spere<br>
At him, that first appeared in his sight:<br>
That was to weet, the stout Sir <i>Sangliere</i>,<br>
Who well was knowen to be a valiant Knight,<br>
Approued oft in many a perlous fight.<br>
Him at the first encounter downe he smote,<br>
And ouerbore beyond his crouper quight,<br>
And after him another Knight, that hote<br>
Sir <i>Brianor</i>, so sore, that none him life behote.<p>

Then ere his hand he reard, he ouerthrew<br>
Seuen Knights one after other as they came:<br>
And when his speare was brust, his sword he drew,<br>
The instrument of wrath, and with the same<br>
Far'd like a lyon in his bloodie game,<br>
Hewing, and slashing shields, and helmets bright,<br>
And beating downe, what euer nigh him came,<br>
That euery one gan shun his dreadfull sight,<br>
No lesse then death it selfe, in daungerous affright.<p>

Much wondred all men, what, or whence he came,<br>
That did amongst the troupes so tyrannize;<br>
And each of other gan inquire his name.<br>
But when they could not learne it by no wize,<br>
Most answerable to his wyld disguize<br>
It seemed, him to terme the saluage knight.<br>
But certes his right name was otherwize,<br>
Though knowne to few, that <i>Arthegall</i> he hight,<br>
The doughtiest knight that liv'd that day, and most of might.<p>

Thus was Sir <i>Satyrane</i> with all his band<br>
By his sole manhood and atchieuement stout<br>
Dismayd, that none of them in field durst stand,<br>
But beaten were, and chased all about.<br>
So he continued all that day throughout,<br>
Till euening, that the Sunne gan downward bend.<br>
Then rushed forth out of the thickest rout<br>
A stranger knight, that did his glorie shend:<br>
So nought may be esteemed happie till the end.<p>

He at his entrance charg'd his powrefull speare<br>
At <i>Artegall</i>, in middest of his pryde,<br>
And therewith smote him on his Vmbriere<br>
So sore, that tombling backe, he downe did slyde<br>
Ouer his horses taile aboue a stryde:<br>
Whence litle lust he had to rise againe.<br>
Which <i>Cambell</i> seeing, much the same enuyde,<br>
And ran at him with all his might and maine;<br>
But shortly was likewise seene lying on the plaine.<p>

Whereat  full inly wroth was <i>Triamond</i>,<br>
And cast t'auenge the shame doen to his freend:<br>
But by his friend himselfe eke soone he fond,<br>
In no lesse neede of helpe, then him he weend.<br>
All which when <i>Blandamour</i> from end to end<br>
Beheld, he woxe therewith displeased sore,<br>
And thought in mind it shortly to amend:<br>
His speare he feutred, and at him it bore;<br>
But with no better fortune, then the rest afore.<p>

Full many others at him likewise ran:<br>
But all of them likewise dismounted were,<br>
Ne certes wonder; for no powre of man<br>
Could bide the force of that enchaunted speare,<br>
The which this famous <i>Britomart</i> did beare;<br>
With which she wondrous deeds of arms atchieued,<br>
And ouerthrew, what euer came her neare,<br>
That all those stranger knights full sore agrieued,<br>
And that late weaker band of chalengers relieued.<p>

Like as in sommers day when raging heat<br>
Doth burne the earth, and boyled riuers drie,<br>
That all brute beasts forst to refraine fro meat,<br>
Doe hunt for shade, where shrowded they may lie,<br>
And missing it, faine from themselues to flie;<br>
All trauellers tormented are with paine:<br>
A watry cloud doth ouercast the skie,<br>
And poureth forth a sudden shoure of raine,<br>
That all the wretched world recomforteth againe.<p>

So did the warlike <i>Britomart</i> restore<br>
The prize, to knights of Maydenhead that day,<br>
Which else was like to haue bene lost, and bore<br>
The prayse of prowesse from them all away.<br>
Then shrilling trompets loudly gan to bray,<br>
And bad them leaue their labours and long toyle,<br>
To ioyous feast and other gentle play;<br>
Where beauties prize shold win that pretious spoyle:<br>
Where I with sound of trompe will also rest a whyle.<p>
