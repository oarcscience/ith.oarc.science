*Cant. III.*

> *Calidore brings Priscilla home,  
> Pursues the Blatant Beast:  
> Saues Serena, whilest Calepine  
> By Turpine is opprest.*

> T rue is, that whilome that good Poet sayd,  
> The gentle minde by gentle deeds is knowne.  
> For a man by nothing is so well bewrayd,  
> As by his manners, in which plaine is showne  
> Of what degree and what race he is growne.  
> For seldome seene, a trotting Stalion get  
> An ambling Colt, that is his proper owne:  
> So seldome seene, that one in basenesse set  
> Doth noble courage shew, with curteous manners met.
>
> But euermore contrary hath bene tryde,  
> That gentle bloud will gentle manners breed;  
> As well may be in *Calidore* descryde,  
> By late ensample of that courteous deed,  
> Done to that wounded Knight in his great need,  
> Whom on his backe he bore, till he him brought  
> Vnto the Castle where they had decreed.  
> There of the Knight, the which that Castle ought,  
> To make abode that night he greatly was besought.
>
> He was to weete a man of full ripe yeares,  
> That in his youth had beene of mickle might,  
> And borne great sway in armes amongst his peares:  
> But now weake age had dimd his candle light.  
> Yet was he courteous still to euery wight,  
> And loued all that did to armes incline.  
> And was the father of that wounded Knight,  
> Whom *Calidore* thus carried on his chine,  
> And *Aldus* was his name, and his sonnes *Aladine*.
>
> Who when he saw his sonne so ill bedight,  
> With bleeding wounds, brought home vpon a Beare  
> By a faire Lady, and a straunger Knight,  
> Was inly touched with compassion deare,  
> And deare affection of so dolefull dreare,  
> That he these words burst forth; Ah sory boy,  
> Is this the hope that to my hoary heare  
> Thou brings? aie me, is this the timely ioy,  
> Which I expected long, now turnd to sad annoy?
>
> Such is the weakenesse of all mortall hope;  
> So tickle is the state of earthly things,  
> That ere they come vnto their aymed scope,  
> They fall too short of our fraile reckonings,  
> And bring vs bale and bitter sorrowings,  
> In stead of comfort, which we should embrace:  
> This is the state of Keasars and of Kings.  
> Let none therefore, that is in meaner place,  
> Too greatly grieue at any his vnlucky case.
>
> So well and wisely did that good old Knight  
> Temper his griefe, and turned it to cheare,  
> To cheare his guests, whom he had stayd that night,  
> And make their welcome to them well appeare:  
> That to Sir *Calidore* was easie geare;  
> But that faire Lady would be cheard for nought,  
> But sigh't and sorrow'd for her louer deare,  
> And inly did afflict her pensiue thought,  
> With thinking to what case her name should now be brought.
>
> For she was daughter to a noble Lord,  
> Which dwelt thereby, who sought her to affy  
> To a great pere; but she did disaccord,  
> Ne could her liking to his loue apply,  
> But lou'd this fresh young Knight, who dwelt her ny,  
> The lusty *Aladine*, though meaner borne,  
> And of lesse liuelood and hability,  
> Yet full of valour, the which did adorne  
> His meanesse much, & make her th'others riches scorne.
>
> So hauing both found fit occasion,  
> They met together in that luckelesse glade;  
> Where that proud Knight in his presumption  
> The gentle *Aladine* did earst inuade,  
> Being vnarm'd, and set in secret shade.  
> Whereof she now bethinking, gan t'aduize,  
> How great a hazard she at earst had made  
> Of her good fame, and further gan deuize,  
> How she the blame might salue with coloured disguize.
>
> But *Calidore* with all good courtesie  
> Fain'd her to frolicke, and to put away  
> The pensiue fit of her melancholie;  
> And that old Knight by all meanes did assay,  
> To make them both as merry as he may.  
> So they the euening past, till time of rest,  
> When *Calidore* in seemly good array  
> Vnto his bowre was brought, and there vndrest,  
> Did sleepe all night through weary trauell of his quest.
>
> But faire *Priscilla* (so that Lady hight)  
> Would to no bed, nor take no kindely sleepe,  
> But by her wounded loue did watch all night,  
> And all the night for bitter anguish weepe,  
> And with her teares his wounds did wash and steepe.  
> So well she washt them, and so well she watcht him,  
> That of the deadly swound, in which full deepe  
> He drenched was, she at the length dispacht him,  
> And droue away the stound, which mortally attacht him.
>
> The morrow next, when day gan to vplooke,  
> He also gan vplooke with drery eye,  
> Like one that out of deadly dreame awooke:  
> Where when he saw his faire *Priscilla* by,  
> He deepely sigh't, and groaned inwardly,  
> To thinke of this ill state, in which she stood,  
> To which she for his sake had weetingly  
> Now brought her selfe, and blam'd her noble blood:  
> For first, next after life, he tendered her good.
>
> Which she perceiuing, did with plenteous teares  
> His care more then her owne compassionate,  
> Forgetfull of her owne, to minde his feares:  
> So both conspiring, gan to intimate  
> Each others griefe with zeale affectionate,  
> And twixt them twaine with equall care to cast,  
> How to saue hole her hazarded estate;  
> For which the onely helpe now left them last  
> Seem'd to be *Calidore*: all other helpes were past.
>
> Him they did deeme, as sure to them he seemed,  
> A courteous Knight, and full of faithfull trust:  
> Therefore to him their cause they best esteemed  
> Whole to commit, and to his dealing iust.  
> Earely, so soone as *Titans* beames forth brust  
> Through the thicke clouds, in which they steeped lay  
> All night in darkenesse, duld with yron rust,  
> *Calidore* rising vp as fresh as day,  
> Gan freshly him addresse vnto his former way.
>
> But first him seemed fit, that wounded Knight  
> To visite, after this nights perillous passe,  
> And to salute him, if he were in plight,  
> And eke that Lady his faire louely lasse.  
> There he him found much better then he was,  
> And moued speach to him of things of course,  
> The anguish of his paine to ouerpasse:  
> Mongst which he namely did to him discourse,  
> Of former daies mishap, his sorrowes wicked sourse.
>
> Of which occasion *Aldine* taking hold,  
> Gan breake to him the fortunes of his loue,  
> And all his disaduentures to vnfold;  
> That *Calidore* it dearly deepe did moue.  
> In th'end his kyndly courtesie to proue,  
> He him by all the bands of loue besought,  
> And as it mote a faithfull friend behoue,  
> To safeconduct his loue, and not for ought  
> To leaue, till to her fathers house he had her brought.
>
> Sir *Calidore* his faith thereto did plight,  
> It to performe: so after little stay,  
> That she her selfe had to the iourney dight,  
> He passed forth with her in faire array,  
> Fearelesse, who ought did thinke, or ought did say,  
> Sith his own thought he knew most cleare from wite.  
> So as they past together on their way,  
> He can deuize this counter-cast of slight,  
> To giue faire colour to that Ladies cause in sight.
>
> Streight to the carkasse of that Knight he went,  
> The cause of all this euill, who was slaine  
> The day before by iust auengement  
> Of noble *Tristram*, where it did remaine:  
> There he the necke thereof did cut in twaine,  
> And tooke with him the head, the signe of shame.  
> So forth he passed thorough that daies paine,  
> Till to that Ladies fathers house he came;  
> Most pensiue man, through feare, what of his childe became.
>
> There he arriuing boldly, did present  
> The fearefull Lady to her father deare,  
> Most perfect pure, and guiltlesse innocent  
> Of blame, as he did on his Knighthood sweare,  
> Since first he saw her, and did free from feare  
> Of a discourteous Knight, who her had reft,  
> And by outragious force away did beare:  
> Witnesse thereof he shew'd his head there left,  
> And wretched life forlorne for vengement of his theft.
>
> Most ioyfull man her sire was her to see,  
> And heare th'aduenture of her late mischaunce;  
> And thousand thankes to *Calidore* for fee  
> Of his large paines in her deliueraunce  
> Did yeeld; Ne lesse the Lady did aduaunce.  
> Thus hauing her restored trustily,  
> As he had vow'd, some small continuaunce  
> He there did make, and then most carefully  
> Vnto his first exploite he did him selfe apply.
>
> So as he was pursuing of his quest  
> He chaunst to come whereas a iolly Knight,  
> In couert shade him selfe did safely rest,  
> To solace with his Lady in delight:  
> His warlike armes he had from him vndight:  
> For that him selfe he thought from daunger free,  
> And far from enuious eyes that mote him spight.  
> And eke the Lady was full faire to see,  
> And courteous withall, becomming her degree.
>
> To whom Sir *Calidore* approaching nye,  
> Ere they were well aware of liuing wight,  
> Them much abasht, but more him selfe thereby,  
> That he so rudely did vppon them light,  
> And troubled had their quiet loues delight.  
> Yet since it was his fortune, not his fault,  
> Him selfe thereof he labour'd to acquite,  
> And pardon crau'd for his so rash assault,  
> That he gainst courtesie so fowly did default.
>
> With which his gentle words and goodly wit  
> He soone allayd that Knights conceiu'd displeasure,  
> That he besought him downe by him to sit,  
> That they mote treat of things abrode at leasure;  
> And of aduentures, which had in his measure  
> Of so long waies to him befallen late.  
> So downe he sate, and with delightfull pleasure  
> His long aduentures gan to him relate,  
> Which he endured had through daungerous debate.
>
> Of which whilest they discoursed both together,  
> The faire *Serena* (so his Lady hight)  
> Allur'd with myldnesse of the gentle wether,  
> And pleasaunce of the place, the which was dight  
> With diuers flowres distinct with rare delight,  
> Wandred about the fields, as liking led  
> Her wauering lust after her wandring sight,  
> To make a garland to adorne her hed,  
> Without suspect of ill or daungers hidden dred.
>
> All sodainely out of the forrest nere  
> The Blatant Beast forth rushing vnaware,  
> Caught her thus loosely wandring here and there,  
> And in his wide great mouth away her bare,  
> Crying aloud to shew her sad misfare  
> Vnto the Knights, and calling oft for ayde;  
> Who with the horrour of her haplesse care  
> Hastily starting vp, like men dismayde,  
> Ran after fast, to reskue the distressed mayde.
>
> The Beast with their pursuit incited more,  
> Into the wood was bearing her apace  
> For to haue spoyled her, when *Calidore*  
> Who was more light of foote and swift in chace,  
> Him ouertooke in middest of his race:  
> And fiercely charging him with all his might,  
> Forst to forgoe his pray there in the place,  
> And to betake him selfe to fearefull flight;  
> For he durst not abide with *Calidore* to fight.
>
> Who nathelesse, when he the Lady saw  
> There left on ground, though in full euill plight,  
> Yet knowing that her Knight now neare did draw,  
> Staide not to succour her in that affright,  
> But follow'd fast the Monster in his flight:  
> Through woods and hils he follow'd him so fast,  
> That he nould let him breath nor gather spright,  
> But forst him gape and gaspe, with dread aghast,  
> As if his lungs and lites were nigh a sunder brast.
>
> And now by this Sir *Calepine*, so hight,  
> Came to the place, where he his Lady found  
> In dolorous dismay and deadly plight,  
> All in gore bloud there tumbled on the ground,  
> Hauing both sides through grypt with griesly wound.  
> His weapons soone from him he threw away,  
> And stouping downe to her in drery swound,  
> Vprear'd her from the ground whereon she lay,  
> And in his tender armes her forced vp to stay.
>
> So well he did his busie paines apply,  
> That the faint sprite he did reuoke againe,  
> To her fraile mansion of mortality.  
> Then vp he tooke her twixt his armes twaine,  
> And setting on his steede, her did sustaine  
> With carefull hands soft footing her beside,  
> Till to some place of rest they mote attaine,  
> Where she in safe assuraunce mote abide,  
> Till she recured were of those her woundes wide.
>
> Now when as *Phoebus* with his fiery waine  
> Vnto his Inne began to draw apace;  
> Tho wexing weary of that toylesome paine,  
> In trauelling on foote so long a space,  
> Not wont on foote with heauy armes to trace,  
> Downe in a dale forby a riuers syde,  
> He chaunst to spie a faire and stately place,  
> To which he meant his weary steps to guyde,  
> In hope there for his loue some succour to prouyde.
>
> But comming to the riuers side, he found  
> That hardly passable on foote it was:  
> Therefore there still he stood as in a stound,  
> Ne wist which way he through the foord mote pas.  
> Thus whilest he was in this distressed case,  
> Deuising what to doe, he nigh espyde  
> An armed Knight approaching to the place,  
> With a faire Lady lincked by his syde,  
> The which themselues prepard thorough the foord to ride.
>
> Whom *Calepine* saluting (as became)  
> Besought of courtesie in that his neede,  
> For safe conducting of his sickely Dame,  
> Through that same perillous foord with better heede,  
> To take him vp behinde vpon his steed:  
> To whom that other did this taunt returne.  
> Perdy thou peasant Knight, mightst rightly reed  
> Me then to be full base and euill borne,  
> If I would beare behinde a burden of such scorne.
>
> But as thou hast thy steed forlorne with shame,  
> So fare on foote till thou another gayne,  
> And let thy Lady likewise doe the same.  
> Or beare her on thy backe with pleasing payne,  
> And proue thy manhood on the billowes vayne.  
> With which rude speach his Lady much displeased,  
> Did him reproue, yet could him not restrayne,  
> And would on her owne Palfrey him haue eased,  
> For pitty of his Dame, whom she saw so diseased.
>
> Sir *Calepine* her thanckt, yet inly wroth  
> Against her Knight, her gentlenesse refused,  
> And carelesly into the riuer goth,  
> As in despight to be so fowle abused  
> Of a rude churle, whom often he accused  
> Of fowle discourtesie, vnfit for Knight;  
> And strongly wading through the waues vnused,  
> With speare in th'one hand, stayd him selfe vpright,  
> With th'other staide his Lady vp with steddy might.
>
> And all the while, that same discourteous Knight,  
> Stood on the further bancke beholding him,  
> At whose calamity, for more despight  
> He laught, and mockt to see him like to swim.  
> But when as *Calepine* came to the brim,  
> And saw his carriage past that perill well,  
> Looking at that same Carle with count'nance grim,  
> His heart with vengeaunce inwardly did swell,  
> And forth at last did breake in speaches sharpe and fell.
>
> Vnknightly Knight, the blemish of that name,  
> And blot of all that armes vppon them take,  
> Which is the badge of honour and of fame,  
> Loe I defie thee, and here challenge make,  
> That thou for euer doe those armes forsake,  
> And be for euer held a recreant Knight,  
> Vnlesse thou dare for thy deare Ladies sake,  
> And for thine owne defence on foote alight,  
> To iustifie thy fault gainst me in equall fight.
>
> The dastard, that did heare him selfe defyde,  
> Seem'd not to weigh his threatfull words at all,  
> But laught them out, as if his greater pryde  
> Did scorne the challenge of so base a thrall:  
> Or had no courage, or else had no gall.  
> So much the more was *Calepine* offended,  
> That him to no reuenge he forth could call,  
> But both his challenge and him selfe contemned,  
> Ne cared as a coward so to be condemned.
>
> But he nought weighing what he sayd or did,  
> Turned his steede about another way,  
> And with his Lady to the Castle rid,  
> Where was his won; ne did the other stay,  
> But after went directly as he may,  
> For his sicke charge some harbour there to seeke;  
> Where he arriuing with the fall of day,  
> Drew to the gate, and there with prayers meeke,  
> And myld entreaty lodging did for her beseeke.
>
> But the rude Porter that no manners had,  
> Did shut the gate against him in his face,  
> And entraunce boldly vnto him forbad.  
> Nathelesse the Knight now in so needy case,  
> Gan him entreat euen with submission base,  
> And humbly praid to let them in that night:  
> Who to him aunswer'd, that there was no place  
> Of lodging fit for any errant Knight,  
> Vnlesse that with his Lord he formerly did fight.
>
> Full loth am I (quoth he) as now at earst,  
> When day is spent, and rest vs needeth most,  
> And that this Lady, both whose sides are pearst  
> With wounds, is ready to forgo the ghost:  
> Ne would I gladly combate with mine host,  
> That should to me such curtesie afford,  
> Vnlesse that I were thereunto enforst.  
> But yet aread to me, how hight thy Lord,  
> That doth thus strongly ward the Castle of the ford.
>
> His name (quoth he) if that thou list to learne,  
> Is hight Sir *Turpine*, one of mickle might,  
> And manhood rare, but terrible and stearne  
> In all assaies to euery errant Knight,  
> Because of one, that wrought him fowle despight.  
> Ill seemes (sayd he) if he so valiaunt be,  
> That he should be so sterne to stranger wight:  
> For seldome yet did liuing creature see,  
> That curtesie and manhood euer disagree.
>
> But go thy waies to him, and fro me say,  
> That here is at his gate an errant Knight,  
> That house-rome craues, yet would be loth t'assay  
> The proofe of battell, now in doubtfull night,  
> Or curtesie with rudenesse to requite:  
> Yet if he needes will fight, craue leaue till morne,  
> And tell withall, the lamentable plight,  
> In which this Lady languisheth forlorne,  
> That pitty craues, as he of woman was yborne.
>
> The groome went streight way in, and to his Lord  
> Declar'd the message, which that Knight did moue;  
> Who sitting with his Lady then at bord,  
> Not onely did not his demaund \[ap\]proue,  
> But both himselfe reuil'd, and eke his loue;  
> Albe his Lady, that *Blandina* hight,  
> Him of vngentle vsage did \[re\]proue  
> And earnestly entreated that they might  
> Finde fauour to be lodged there for that same night.
>
> Yet would he not perswaded be for ought,  
> Ne from his currish will awhit reclame.  
> Which answer when the groome returning, brought  
> To *Calepine*, his heart did inly flame  
> With wrathfull fury for so foule a shame,  
> That he could not thereof auenged bee:  
> But most for pitty of his dearest Dame,  
> Whom now in deadly daunger he did see;  
> Yet had no meanes to comfort, nor procure her glee.
>
> But all in vaine; for why, no remedy  
> He saw, the present mischiefe to redresse,  
> But th'vtmost end perforce for to aby,  
> Which that nights fortune would for him addresse.  
> So downe he tooke his Lady in distresse,  
> And layd her vnderneath a bush to sleepe,  
> Couer'd with cold, and wrapt in wretchednesse,  
> Whiles he him selfe all night did nought but weepe,  
> And wary watch about her for her safegard keepe.
>
> The morrow next, so soone as ioyous day  
> Did shew it selfe in sunny beames bedight,  
> *Serena* full of dolorous dismay,  
> Twixt darkenesse dread, and hope of liuing light,  
> Vprear'd her head to see that chearefull sight.  
> Then *Calepine*, how euer inly wroth,  
> And greedy to auenge that vile despight,  
> Yet for the feeble Ladies sake, full loth  
> To make there lenger stay, forth on his iourney goth.
>
> He goth on foote all armed by her side,  
> Vpstaying still her selfe vppon her steede,  
> Being vnhable else alone to ride;  
> So sore her sides, so much her wounds did bleede:  
> Till that at length, in his extreamest neede,  
> He chaunst far off an armed Knight to spy,  
> Pursuing him apace with greedy speede,  
> Whom well he wist to be some enemy,  
> That meant to make aduantage of his misery.
>
> Wherefore he stayd, till that he nearer drew,  
> To weet what issue would thereof betyde,  
> Tho whenas he approched nigh in vew,  
> By certaine signes he plainely him descryde,  
> To be the man, that with such scornefull pryde  
> Had him abusde, and shamed yesterday;  
> Therefore misdoubting, least he should misguyde  
> His former malice to some new assay,  
> He cast to keepe him selfe so safely as he may.
>
> By this the other came in place likewise,  
> And couching close his speare and all his powre,  
> As bent to some malicious enterprise,  
> He bad him stand, t'abide the bitter stoure  
> Of his sore vengeaunce, or to make auoure  
> Of the lewd words and deedes, which he had done:  
> With that ran at him, as he would deuoure  
> His life attonce; who nought could do, but shun  
> The perill of his pride, or else be ouerrun.
>
> Yet he him still pursew'd from place to place,  
> Will full intent him cruelly to kill;  
> And like a wilde goate round about did chace,  
> Flying the fury of his bloudy will.  
> But his best succour and refuge was still  
> Behinde his Ladies backe, who to him cryde,  
> And called oft with prayers loud and shrill,  
> As euer he to Lady was affyde,  
> To spare her Knight, and rest with reason pacifyde.
>
> But he the more thereby enraged was,  
> And with more eager felnesse him pursew'd:  
> So that at length, after long weary chace,  
> Hauing by chaunce a close aduantage vew'd,  
> He ouer raught him, hauing long eschew'd  
> His violence in vaine, and with his spere  
> Strooke through his shoulder, that the blood ensew'd  
> In great aboundance, as a well it were,  
> That forth out of an hill fresh gushing did appere.
>
> Yet ceast he not for all that cruell wound,  
> But chaste him still, for all his Ladies cry;  
> Not satisfyde till on the fatall ground  
> He saw his life powrd forth dispiteously:  
> The which was certes in great ieopardy,  
> Had not a wondrous chaunce his reskue wrought,  
> And saued from his cruell villany.  
> Such chaunces oft exceed all humaine thought:  
> That in another Canto shall to end be brought.
