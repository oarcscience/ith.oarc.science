<i>Artegall fights with Radigund<br>
And is subdewd by guile:<br>
He is by her emprisoned,<br>
But wrought by Clarins wile.</i><p>

<p>
<blockquote>
S
O soone as day forth dawning from the East,<br>
Nights humid curtaine from the heauens withdrew,<br>
And earely calling forth both man and beast,<br>
Comaunded them their daily workes renew,<br>
These noble warriors, mindefull to pursew<br>
The last daies purpose of their vowed fight,<br>
Them selues thereto preparde in order dew;<br>
The Knight, as best was seeming for a Knight,<br>
And th'Amazon, as best it likt her selfe to dight.<p>

All in a Camis light of purple silke<br>
Wouen vppon with siluer, subtly wrought,<br>
And quilted vppon sattin white as milke,<br>
Trayled with ribbands diuersly distraught<br>
Like as the workeman had their courses taught;<br>
Which was short tucked for light motion<br>
Vp to her ham, but when she list, it raught<br>
Downe to her lowest heele, and thereuppon<br>
She wore for her defence a mayled habergeon.<p>

And on her legs she painted buskins wore,<br>
Basted with bends of gold on euery side,<br>
And mailes betweene, and laced close afore:<br>
Vppon her thigh her Cemitare was tide,<br>
With an embrodered belt of mickell pride;<br>
And on her shoulder hung her shield, bedeckt<br>
Vppon the bosse with stones, that shined wide,<br>
As the faire Moone in her most full aspect,<br>
That to the Moone it mote be like in each respect.<p>

So forth she came out of the citty gate,<br>
With stately port and proud magnificence,<br>
Guarded with many damzels, that did waite<br>
Vppon her person for her sure defence,<br>
Playing on shaumes and trumpets, that from hence<br>
Their sound did reach vnto the heauens hight.<br>
So forth into the field she marched thence,<br>
Where was a rich Pauilion ready pight,<br>
Her to receiue, till time they should begin the fight.<p>

Then forth came <i>Artegall</i> out of his tent,<br>
All arm'd to point, and first the Lists did enter:<br>
Soone after eke came she, with fell intent,<br>
And countenaunce fierce, as hauing fully bent her,<br>
That battels vtmost triall to aduenter.<br>
The Lists were closed fast, to barre the rout<br>
From rudely pressing to the middle center;<br>
Which in great heapes them circled all about,<br>
Wayting, how Fortune would resolue that daungerous dout.<p>

The Trumpets sounded, and the field began;<br>
With bitter strokes it both began, and ended.<br>
She at the first encounter on him ran<br>
With furious rage, as if she had intended<br>
Out of his breast the very heart haue rended:<br>
But he that had like tempests often tride,<br>
From that first flaw him selfe right well defended.<br>
The more she rag'd, the more he did abide;<br>
She hewd, she foynd, she lasht, she laid on euery side.<p>

Yet still her blowes he bore, and her forbore,<br>
Weening at last to win aduantage new;<br>
Yet still her crueltie increased more,<br>
And though powre faild, her courage did accrew:<br>
Which fayling he gan fiercely her pursew.<br>
Like as a Smith that to his cunning feat<br>
The stubborne mettall seeketh to subdew,<br>
Soone as he feeles it mollifide with heat,<br>
With his great yron sledge doth strongly on it beat.<p>

So did Sir <i>Artegall</i> vpon her lay,<br>
As if she had an yron anduile beene,<br>
That flakes of fire, bright as the sunny ray,<br>
Out of her steely armes were flashing seene,<br>
That all on fire ye would her surely weene.<br>
But with her shield so well her selfe she warded,<br>
From the dread daunger of his weapon keene,<br>
That all that while her life she safely garded:<br>
But he that helpe from her against her will discarded.<p>

For with his trenchant blade at the next blow<br>
Halfe of her shield he shared quite away,<br>
That halfe her side it selfe did naked show,<br>
And thenceforth vnto daunger opened way.<br>
Much was she moued with the mightie sway<br>
Of that sad stroke, that halfe enrag'd she grew,<br>
And like a greedie Beare vnto her pray,<br>
With her sharpe Cemitare at him she flew,<br>
That glauncing downe his thigh, the purple bloud forth drew.<p>

Thereat she gan to triumph with great boast,<br>
And to vpbrayd that chaunce, which him misfell,<br>
As if the prize she gotten had almost,<br>
With spightfull speaches, fitting with her well;<br>
That his great hart gan inwardly to swell<br>
With indignation, at her vaunting vaine,<br>
And at her strooke with puissance fearefull fell;<br>
Yet with her shield she warded it againe,<br>
That shattered all to peeces round about the plaine.<p>

Hauing her thus disarmed of her shield,<br>
Vpon her helmet he againe her strooke,<br>
That downe she fell vpon the grassie field,<br>
In sencelesse swoune, as if her life forsooke,<br>
And pangs of death her spirit ouertooke.<br>
Whom when he saw before his foote prostrated,<br>
He to her lept with deadly dreadfull looke,<br>
And her sunshynie helmet soone vnlaced,<br>
Thinking at once both head and helmet to haue raced.<p>

But when as he discouered had her face,<br>
He saw his senses straunge astonishment,<br>
A miracle of natures goodly grace,<br>
In her faire visage voide of ornament,<br>
But bath'd in bloud and sweat together ment;<br>
Which in the rudenesse of that euill plight,<br>
Bewrayd the signes of feature excellent:<br>
Like as the Moone in foggie winters night,<br>
Doth seeme to be her selfe, though darkned be her light.<p>

At sight thereof his cruell minded hart<br>
Empierced was with pittifull regard,<br>
That his sharpe sword he threw from him apart,<br>
Cursing his hand that had that visage mard:<br>
No hand so cruell, nor no hart so hard,<br>
But ruth of beautie will it mollifie.<br>
By this vpstarting from her swoune, she star'd<br>
A while about her with confused eye;<br>
Like one that from his dreame is waked suddenlye.<p>

Soone as the knight she there by her did spy,<br>
Standing with emptie hands all weaponlesse,<br>
With fresh assault vpon him she did fly,<br>
And gan renew her former cruelnesse:<br>
And though he still retyr'd, yet nathelesse<br>
With huge redoubled strokes she on him layd;<br>
And more increast her outrage mercilesse,<br>
The more that he with meeke intreatie prayd,<br>
Her wrathful hand from greedy vengeance to haue stayd.<p>

Like as a Puttocke hauing spyde in sight<br>
A gentle Faulcon sitting on an hill,<br>
Whose other wing, now made vnmeete for flight,<br>
Was lately broken by some fortune ill;<br>
The foolish Kyte, led with licentious will,<br>
Doth beat vpon the gentle bird in vaine,<br>
With many idle stoups her troubling still:<br>
Euen so did <i>Radigund</i> with bootlesse paine<br>
Annoy this noble Knight, and sorely him constraine.<p>

Nought could he do, but shun the dred despight<br>
Of her fierce wrath, and backward still retyre,<br>
And with his single shield, well as he might,<br>
Beare off the burden of her raging yre;<br>
And euermore he gently did desyre,<br>
To stay her stroks, and he himselfe would yield:<br>
Yet nould she hearke, ne let him once respyre,<br>
Till he to her deliuered had his shield,<br>
And to her mercie him submitted in plaine field.<p>

So was he ouercome, not ouercome,<br>
But to her yeelded of his owne accord;<br>
Yet was he iustly damned by the doome<br>
Of his owne mouth, that spake so warelesse word,<br>
To be her thrall, and seruice her afford.<br>
For though that he first victorie obtayned,<br>
Yet after by abandoning his sword,<br>
He wilfull lost, that he before attayned.<br>
No fayrer conquest, then that with goodwill is gayned.<p>

Tho with her sword on him she flatling strooke,<br>
In signe of true subiection to her powre,<br>
And as her vassall him to thraldome tooke.<br>
But <i>Terpine</i> borne to'a more vnhappy howre,<br>
As he, on whom the lucklesse starres did lowre,<br>
She causd to be attacht, and forthwith led<br>
Vnto the crooke t'abide the balefull stowre,<br>
From which he lately had through reskew fled:<br>
Where he full shamefully was hanged by the hed.<p>

But when they thought on <i>Talus</i> hands to lay,<br>
He with his yron flaile amongst them thondred,<br>
That they were fayne to let him scape away,<br>
Glad from his companie to be so sondred;<br>
Whose presence all their troups so much encombred<br>
That th'heapes of those, which he did wound and slay,<br>
Besides the rest dismayd, might not be nombred:<br>
Yet all that while he would not once assay,<br>
To reskew his owne Lord, but thought it iust t'obay.<p>

Then tooke the Amazon this noble knight,<br>
Left to her will by his owne wilfull blame,<br>
And caused him to be disarmed quight,<br>
Of all the ornaments of knightly name,<br>
With which whylome he gotten had great fame:<br>
In stead whereof she made him to be dight<br>
In womans weedes, that is to manhood shame,<br>
And put before his lap a napron white,<br>
In stead of Curiets and bases fit for fight.<p>

So being clad, she brought him from the field,<br>
In which he had bene trayned many a day,<br>
Into a long large chamber, which was sield<br>
With moniments of many knights decay,<br>
By her subdewed in victorious fray:<br>
Amongst the which she causd his warlike armes<br>
Be hang'd on high, that mote his shame bewray;<br>
And broke his sword, for feare of further harmes,<br>
With which he wont to stirre vp battailous alarmes.<p>

There entred in, he round about him saw<br>
Many braue knights, whose names right well he knew,<br>
There bound t'obay that Amazons proud law,<br>
Spinning and carding all in comely rew,<br>
That his bigge hart loth'd so vncomely vew.<br>
But they were forst through penurie and pyne,<br>
To doe those workes, to them appointed dew:<br>
For nought was giuen them to sup or dyne,<br>
But what their hands could earne by twisting linnen twyne.<p>

Amongst them all she placed him most low,<br>
And in his hand a distaffe to him gaue,<br>
That he thereon should spin both flax and tow;<br>
A sordid office for a mind so braue.<br>
So hard it is to be a womans slaue.<br>
Yet he it tooke in his owne selfes despight,<br>
And thereto did himselfe right well behaue,<br>
Her to obay, sith he his faith had plight,<br>
Her vassall to become, if she him wonne in fight.<p>

Who had him seene, imagine mote thereby,<br>
That whylome hath of <i>Hercules</i> bene told,<br>
How for <i>Iolas</i> sake he did apply<br>
His mightie hands, the distaffe vile to hold,<br>
For his huge club, which had subdew'd of old<br>
So many monsters, which the world annoyed;<br>
His Lyons skin chaungd to a pall of gold,<br>
In which forgetting warres, he onely ioyed<br>
In combats of sweet loue, and with his mistresse toyed.<p>

Such is the crueltie of womenkynd,<br>
When they haue shaken off the shamefast band,<br>
With which wise Nature did them strongly bynd,<br>
T'obay the heasts of mans well ruling hand,<br>
That then all rule and reason they withstand,<br>
To purchase a licentious libertie.<br>
But vertuous women wisely vnderstand,<br>
That they were borne to base humilitie,<br>
Vnlesse the heauens them lift to lawfull soueraintie.<p>

Thus there long while continu'd <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
Seruing proud <i>Radigund</i> with true subiection;<br>
How euer it his noble heart did gall,<br>
T'obay a womans tyrannous direction,<br>
That might haue had of life or death election:<br>
But hauing chosen, now he might not chaunge.<br>
During which time, the warlike Amazon,<br>
Whose wandring fancie after lust did raunge,<br>
Gan cast a secret liking to this captiue straunge.<p>

Which long concealing in her couert brest,<br>
She chaw'd the cud of louers carefull plight;<br>
Yet could it not so thoroughly digest,<br>
Being fast fixed in her wounded spright,<br>
But it tormented her both day and night:<br>
Yet would she not thereto yeeld free accord,<br>
To serue the lowly vassall of her might,<br>
And of her seruant make her souerayne Lord:<br>
So great her pride, that she such basenesse much abhord.<p>

So much the greater still her anguish grew,<br>
Through stubborne handling of her loue-sicke hart;<br>
And still the more she stroue it to subdew,<br>
The more she still augmented her owne smart,<br>
And wyder made the wound of th'hidden dart.<br>
At last when long she struggled had in vaine,<br>
She gan to stoupe, and her proud mind conuert<br>
To meeke obeysance of loues mightie raine,<br>
And him entreat for grace, that had procur'd her paine.<p>

Vnto her selfe in secret she did call<br>
Her nearest handmayd, whom she most did trust,<br>
And to her said; <i>Clarinda</i> whom of all<br>
I trust a liue, sith I thee fostred first;<br>
Now is the time, that I vntimely must<br>
Thereof make tryall, in my greatest need:<br>
It is so hapned, that the heauens vniust,<br>
Spighting my happie freedome, haue agreed,<br>
To thrall my looser life, or my last bale to breed.<p>

With that she turn'd her head, as halfe abashed,<br>
To hide the blush which in her visage rose,<br>
And through her eyes like sudden lightning flashed,<br>
Decking her cheeke with a vermilion rose:<br>
But soone she did her countenance compose,<br>
And to her turning, thus began againe;<br>
This griefes deepe wound I would to thee disclose,<br>
Thereto compelled through hart-murdring paine,<br>
But dread of shame my doubtfull lips doth still restraine.<p>

Ah my deare dread (said then the faithfull Mayd)<br>
Can dread of ought your dreadlesse hart withhold,<br>
That many hath with dread of death dismayd,<br>
And dare euen deathes most dreadfull face behold?<br>
Say on my souerayne Ladie, and be bold;<br>
Doth not your handmayds life at your foot lie?<br>
Therewith much comforted, she gan vnfold<br>
The cause of her conceiued maladie,<br>
As one that would confesse, yet faine would it denie.<p>

<i>Clarin</i> (sayd she) thou seest yond Fayry Knight,<br>
Whom not my valour, but his owne braue mind<br>
Subiected hath to my vnequall might;<br>
What right is it, that he should thraldome find,<br>
For lending life to me a wretch vnkind;<br>
That for such good him recompence with ill?<br>
Therefore I cast, how I may him vnbind,<br>
And by his freedome get his free goodwill;<br>
Yet so, as bound to me he may continue still.<p>

Bound vnto me, but not with such hard bands<br>
Of strong compulsion, and streight violence,<br>
As now in miserable state he stands;<br>
But with sweet loue and sure beneuolence,<br>
Voide of malitious mind, or foule offence.<br>
To which if thou canst win him any way,<br>
Without discouerie of my thoughts pretence,<br>
Both goodly meede of him it purchase may,<br>
And eke with gratefull seruice me right well apay.<p>

Which that thou mayst the better bring to pas,<br>
Loe here this ring, which shall thy warrant bee,<br>
And token true to old <i>Eumenias</i>,<br>
From time to time, when thou it best shalt see,<br>
That in and out thou mayst haue passage free.<br>
Goe now, <i>Clarinda</i>, well thy wits aduise,<br>
And all thy forces gather vnto thee;<br>
Armies of louely lookes, and speeches wise,<br>
With which thou canst euen <i>Ioue</i> himselfe to loue entise.<p>

The trustie Mayd, conceiuing her intent,<br>
Did with sure promise of her good indeuour,<br>
Giue her great comfort, and some harts content.<br>
So from her parting, she thenceforth did labour<br>
By all the meanes she might, to curry fauour<br>
With th'Elfin Knight, her Ladies best beloued;<br>
With daily shew of courteous kind behauiour,<br>
Euen at the markewhite of his hart she roued,<br>
And with wide glauncing words, one day she thus him proued.<p>

Vnhappie Knight, vpon whose hopelesse state<br>
Fortune enuying good, hath felly frowned,<br>
And cruell heauens haue heapt an heauy fate;<br>
I rew that thus thy better dayes are drowned<br>
In sad despaire, and all thy senses swowned<br>
In stupid sorow, sith thy iuster merit<br>
Might else haue with felicitie bene crowned:<br>
Looke vp at last, and wake thy dulled spirit,<br>
To thinke how this long death thou mightest disinherit.<p>

Much did he maruell at her vncouth speach,<br>
Whose hidden drift he could not well perceiue;<br>
And gan to doubt, least she him sought t'appeach<br>
Of treason, or some guilefull traine did weaue,<br>
Through which she might his wretched life bereaue.<br>
Both which to barre, he with this answere met her;<br>
Faire Damzell, that with ruth (as I perceaue)<br>
Of my mishaps, art mou'd to wish me better,<br>
For such your kind regard, I can but rest your detter.<p>

Yet weet ye well, that to a courage great<br>
It is no lesse beseeming well, to beare<br>
The storme of fortunes frowne, or heauens threat,<br>
Then in the sunshine of her countenance cleare<br>
Timely to ioy, and carrie comely cheare.<br>
For though this cloud haue now me ouercast,<br>
Yet doe I not of better times despeyre;<br>
And, though (vnlike) they should for euer last,<br>
Yet in my truthes assurance I rest fixed fast.<p>

But what so stonie mind (she then replyde)<br>
But if in his owne powre occasion lay,<br>
Would to his hope a windowe open wyde,<br>
And to his fortunes helpe make readie way?<br>
Vnworthy sure (quoth he) of better day,<br>
That will not take the offer of good hope,<br>
And eke pursew, if he attaine it may.<br>
Which speaches she applying to the scope<br>
Of her intent, this further purpose to him shope.<p>

Then why doest not, thou ill aduized man,<br>
Make meanes to win thy libertie forlorne,<br>
And try if thou by faire entreatie, can<br>
Moue <i>Radigund</i>? who though she still haue worne<br>
Her dayes in warre, yet (weet thou) was not borne<br>
Of Beares and Tygres, nor so saluage mynded,<br>
As that, albe all loue of men she scorne,<br>
She yet forgets, that she of men was kynded:<br>
And sooth oft seene, that proudest harts base loue hath blynded.<p>

Certes <i>Clarinda</i>, not of cancred will,<br>
(Sayd he) nor obstinate disdainefull mind,<br>
I haue forbore this duetie to fulfill:<br>
For well I may this weene, by that I fynd,<br>
That she a Queene, and come of Princely kynd,<br>
Both worthie is for to be sewd vnto,<br>
Chiefely by him, whose life her law doth bynd,<br>
And eke of powre her owne doome to vndo,<br>
And als' of princely grace to be inclyn'd thereto.<p>

But want of meanes hath bene mine onely let,<br>
From seeking fauour, where it doth abound;<br>
Which if I might by your good office get,<br>
I to your selfe should rest for euer bound,<br>
And readie to deserue, what grace I found.<br>
She feeling him thus bite vpon the bayt,<br>
Yet doubting least his hold was but vnsound,<br>
And not well fastened, would not strike him strayt,<br>
But drew him on with hope, fit leasure to awayt.<p>

But foolish Mayd, whyles heedlesse of the hooke,<br>
She thus oft times was beating off and on,<br>
Through slipperie footing, fell into the brooke,<br>
And there was caught to her confusion.<br>
For seeking thus to salue the Amazon,<br>
She wounded was with her deceipts owne dart,<br>
And gan thenceforth to cast affection,<br>
Conceiued close in her beguiled hart,<br>
To <i>Artegall</i>, through pittie of his causelesse smart.<p>

Yet durst she not disclose her fancies wound,<br>
Ne to himselfe, for doubt of being sdayned,<br>
Ne yet to any other wight on ground,<br>
For feare her mistresse shold haue knowledge gayned,<br>
But to her selfe it secretly retayned,<br>
Within the closet of her couert brest:<br>
The more thereby her tender hart was payned.<br>
Yet to awayt fit time she weened best,<br>
And fairely did dissemble her sad thoughts vnrest.<p>

One day her Ladie, calling her apart,<br>
Gan to demaund of her some tydings good,<br>
Touching her loues successe, her lingring smart.<br>
Therewith she gan at first to change her mood,<br>
As one adaw'd, and halfe confused stood;<br>
But quickly she it ouerpast, so soone<br>
As she her face had wypt, to fresh her blood:<br>
Tho gan she tell her all, that she had donne,<br>
And all the wayes she sought, his loue for to haue wonne.<p>

But sayd, that he was obstinate and sterne,<br>
Scorning her offers and conditions vaine;<br>
Ne would be taught with any termes, to lerne<br>
So fond a lesson, as to loue againe.<br>
Die rather would he in penurious paine,<br>
And his abridged dayes in dolour wast,<br>
Then his foes loue or liking entertaine:<br>
His resolution was both first and last,<br>
His bodie was her thrall, his hart was freely plast.<p>

Which when the cruell Amazon perceiued,<br>
She gan to storme, and rage, and rend her gall,<br>
For very fell despight, which she conceiued,<br>
To be so scorned of a base borne thrall,<br>
Whose life did lie in her least eye-lids fall;<br>
Of which she vow'd with many a cursed threat,<br>
That she therefore would him ere long forestall.<br>
Nathlesse when calmed was her furious heat,<br>
She chang'd that threatfull mood, &amp; mildly gan entreat.<p>

What now is left <i>Clarinda</i>? what remaines,<br>
That we may compasse this our enterprize?<br>
Great shame to lose so long employed paines,<br>
And greater shame t'abide so great misprize,<br>
With which he dares our offers thus despize.<br>
Yet that his guilt the greater may appeare,<br>
And more my gratious mercie by this wize,<br>
I will a while with his first folly beare,<br>
Till thou haue tride againe, &amp; tempted him more neare.<p>

Say, and do all, that may thereto preuaile;<br>
Leaue nought vnpromist, that may him perswade,<br>
Life, freedome, grace, and gifts of great auaile,<br>
With which the Gods themselues are mylder made:<br>
Thereto adde art, euen womens witty trade,<br>
The art of mightie words, that men can charme;<br>
With which in case thou canst him not inuade,<br>
Let him feele hardnesse of thy heauie arme:<br>
Who will not stoupe with good, shall be made stoupe with harme.<p>

Some of his diet doe from him withdraw;<br>
For I him find to be too proudly fed.<br>
Giue him more labour, and with streighter law,<br>
That he with worke may be forwearied.<br>
Let him lodge hard, and lie in strawen bed,<br>
That may pull downe the courage of his pride;<br>
And lay vpon him, for his greater dread,<br>
Cold yron chaines, with which let him be tide;<br>
And let, what euer he desires, be him denide.<p>

When thou hast all this doen, then bring me newes<br>
Of his demeane: thenceforth not like a louer,<br>
But like a rebell stout I will him vse.<br>
For I resolue this siege not to giue ouer,<br>
Till I the conquest of my will recouer.<br>
So she departed, full of griefe and sdaine,<br>
Which inly did to great impatience moue her.<br>
But the false mayden shortly turn'd againe<br>
Vnto the prison, where her hart did thrall remaine.<p>

There all her subtill nets she did vnfold,<br>
And all the engins of her wit display;<br>
In which she meant him warelesse to enfold,<br>
And of his innocence to make her pray.<br>
So cunningly she wrought her crafts assay,<br>
That both her Ladie, and her selfe withall,<br>
And eke the knight attonce she did betray:<br>
But most the knight, whom she with guilefull call<br>
Did cast for to allure, into her trap to fall.<p>

As a bad Nurse, which fayning to receiue<br>
In her owne mouth the food, ment for her chyld,<br>
Withholdes it to her selfe, and doeth deceiue<br>
The infant, so for want of nourture spoyld:<br>
Euen so <i>Clarinda</i> her owne Dame beguyld,<br>
And turn'd the trust, which was in her affyde,<br>
To feeding of her priuate fire, which boyld<br>
Her inward brest, and in her entrayles fryde,<br>
The more that she it sought to couer and to hyde.<p>

For comming to this knight, she purpose fayned,<br>
How earnest suit she earst for him had made<br>
Vnto her Queene, his freedome to haue gayned;<br>
But by no meanes could her thereto perswade:<br>
But that in stead therof, she sternely bade<br>
His miserie to be augmented more,<br>
And many yron bands on him to lade.<br>
All which nathlesse she for his loue forbore:<br>
So praying him t'accept her seruice euermore.<p>

And more then that, she promist that she would,<br>
In case she might finde fauour in his eye,<br>
Deuize how to enlarge him out of hould.<br>
The Fayrie glad to gaine his libertie,<br>
Can yeeld great thankes for such her curtesie,<br>
And with faire words, fit for the time and place,<br>
To feede the humour of her maladie;<br>
Promist, if she would free him from that case,<br>
He wold by all good means he might, deserue such grace.<p>

So daily he faire semblant did her shew,<br>
Yet neuer meant he in his noble mind,<br>
To his owne absent loue to be vntrew:<br>
Ne euer did deceiptfull <i>Clarin</i> find<br>
In her false hart, his bondage to vnbind;<br>
But rather how she mote him faster tye.<br>
Therefore vnto her mistresse most vnkind<br>
She daily told, her loue he did defye,<br>
And him she told, her Dame his freedome did denye.<p>

Yet thus much friendship she to him did show,<br>
That his scarse diet somewhat was amended,<br>
And his worke lessened, that his loue mote grow:<br>
Yet to her Dame him still she discommended,<br>
That she with him mote be the more offended.<br>
Thus he long while in thraldome there remayned,<br>
Of both beloued well, but litle frended;<br>
Vntill his owne true loue his freedome gayned,<br>
Which in an other Canto will be best contayned.<p>
