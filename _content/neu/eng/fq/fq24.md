*Cant. XI.*

> *The enimies of Temperaunce  
> besiege her dwelling place:  
> Prince Arthur them repelles, and fowle  
> Maleger doth deface.*

> W Hat warre so cruell, or what siege so sore,  
> As that, which strong affections do apply  
> Against the fort of reason euermore  
> Bring the soule into captiuitie:  
> Their force is fiercer through infirmitie  
> Of the fraile flesh, relenting to their rage,  
> And exercise most bitter tyranny  
> Vpon the parts, brought into their bondage:  
> No wretchednesse is like to sinfull vellenage.
>
> But in a body, which doth freely yeeld  
> His partes to reasons rule obedient,  
> And letteth her that ought the scepter weeld,  
> All happy peace and goodly gouernment  
> Is setled there in sure establishment;  
> There *Alma* like a virgin Queene most bright,  
> Doth florish in all beautie excellent:  
> And to her guestes doth bounteous banket dight,  
> Attempred goodly well for health and for delight.
>
> Early before the Morne with cremosin ray,  
> The windowes of bright heauen opened had,  
> Through which into the world the dawning day  
> Might looke, that maketh euery creature glad,  
> Vprose Sir *Guyon*, in bright armour clad,  
> And to his purposd iourney him prepar'd:  
> With him the Palmer eke in habit sad,  
> Him selfe addrest to that aduenture hard:  
> So to the riuers side they both together far'd.
>
> Where them awaited ready at the ford  
> The *Ferriman*, as *Alma* had behight,  
> With his well rigged boate: They go abord,  
> And he eftsoones gan launch his barke forthright.  
> Ere long they rowed were quite out of sight,  
> And fast the land behind them fled away.  
> But let them pas, whiles wind and weather right  
> Do serue their turnes: here I a while must stay,  
> To see a cruell fight doen by the Prince this day.
>
> For all so soone, as *Guyon* thence was gon  
> Vpon his voyage with his trustie guide,  
> That wicked band of villeins fresh begon  
> That castle to assaile on euery side,  
> And lay strong siege about it far and wide.  
> So huge and infinite their numbers were,  
> That all the land they vnder them did hide;  
> So fowle and vgly, that exceeding feare  
> Their visages imprest, when they approched neare.
>
> Them in twelue troupes their Captain did dispart  
> And round about in fittest steades did place,  
> Where each might best offend his proper part,  
> And his contrary obiect most deface,  
> As euery one seem'd meetest in that cace.  
> Seuen of the same against the Castle gate,  
> In strong entrenchments he did closely place,  
> Which with incessaunt force and endlesse hate,  
> They battred day and night, and entraunce did awate.
>
> The other fiue, fiue sundry wayes he set,  
> Against the fiue great Bulwarkes of that pile,  
> And vnto each a Bulwarke did arret,  
> T'assayle with open force or hidden guile,  
> In hope thereof to win victorious spoile.  
> They all that charge did feruently apply,  
> With greedie malice and importune toyle,  
> And planted there their huge artillery,  
> With which they dayly made most dreadfull battery.
>
> The first troupe was a monstrous rablement  
> Of fowle misshapen wights, of which some were  
> Headed like Owles, with beckes vncomely bent,  
> Others like Dogs, others like Gryphons dreare,  
> And some had wings, and some had clawes to teare,  
> And euery one of them had Lynces eyes,  
> And euery one did bow and arrowes beare:  
> All those were lawlesse lustes, corrupt enuies,  
> And couetous aspectes, all cruell enimies.
>
> Those same against the bulwarke of the *Sight*  
> Did lay strong siege, and battailous assault,  
> Ne once did yield it respit day nor night,  
> But soone as *Titan* gan his head exault,  
> And soone againe as he his light withhault,  
> Their wicked engins they against it bent:  
> That is each thing, by which the eyes may fault:  
> But two then all more huge and violent,  
> Beautie, and money, they that Bulwarke sorely rent.
>
> The second Bulwarke was the *Hearing* sence,  
> Gainst which the second troupe dessignment makes;  
> Deformed creatures, in straunge difference,  
> Some hauing heads like Harts, some like to Snakes,  
> Some like wild Bores late rouzd out of the brakes;  
> Slaunderous reproches, and fowle infamies,  
> Leasings, backbytings, and vaine-glorious crakes,  
> Bad counsels, prayses, and false flatteries.  
> All those against that fort did bend their batteries.
>
> Likewise that same third Fort, that is the *Smell*  
> Of that third troupe was cruelly assayd:  
> Whose hideous shapes were like to feends of hell,  
> Some like to hounds, some like to Apes, dismayd,  
> Some like to Puttockes, all in plumes arayd:  
> All shap't according their conditions,  
> For by those vgly formes weren pourtrayd,  
> Foolish delights and fond abusions,  
> Which do that sence besiege with light illusions.
>
> And that fourth band, which cruell battry bent,  
> Against the fourth Bulwarke, that is the *Tast*,  
> Was as the rest, a grysie rablement,  
> Some mouth'd like greedy Oystriges, some fast  
> Like loathly Toades, some fashioned in the wast  
> Like swine; for so deformd is luxury,  
> Surfeat, misdiet, and vnthriftie wast,  
> Vaine feasts, and idle superfluity:  
> All those this sences Fort assayle incessantly.
>
> But the fift troupe most horrible of hew,  
> And fierce of force, was dreadfull to report:  
> For some like Snailes, some did like spyders shew,  
> And some like vgly Vrchins thicke and short:  
> Cruelly they assayled that fift Fort,  
> Armed with darts of sensuall delight,  
> With stings of carnall lust, and strong effort  
> Of feeling pleasures, with which day and night  
> Against that same fift bulwarke they continued fight.
>
> Thus these twelue troupes with dreadfull puissance  
> Against that Castle restlesse siege did lay,  
> And euermore their hideous Ordinance  
> Vpon the Bulwarkes cruelly did play,  
> That now it gan to threaten neare decay:  
> And euermore their wicked Capitaine  
> Prouoked them the breaches to assay,  
> Somtimes with threats, somtimes with hope of gaine,  
> Which by the ransack of that peece they should attaine.
>
> On th'other side, th'assieged Castles ward  
> Their stedfast stonds did mightily maintaine,  
> And many bold repulse, and many hard  
> Atchieuement wrought with perill and with paine,  
> That goodly frame from ruine to sustaine:  
> And those two brethren Giants did defend  
> The walles so stoutly with their sturdie maine,  
> That neuer entrance any durst pretend,  
> But they to direfull death their groning ghosts did send.
>
> The noble virgin, Ladie of the place,  
> Was much dismayed with that dreadfull sight:  
> For neuer was she in so euill cace,  
> Till that the Prince seeing her wofull plight,  
> Gan her recomfort from so sad affright,  
> Offring his seruice, and his dearest life  
> For her defence, against that Carle to fight,  
> Which was their chiefe and th'author of that strife:  
> She him remercied as the Patrone of her life.
>
> Eftsoones himselfe in glitterand armes he dight,  
> And his well proued weapons to him hent;  
> So taking courteous conge he behight,  
> Those gates to be vnbar'd, and forth he went.  
> Faire mote he thee, the prowest and most gent,  
> That euer brandished bright steele on hye:  
> Whom soone as that vnruly rablement,  
> With his gay Squire issuing did espy,  
> They reard a most outrageous dreadfull yelling cry,
>
> And therewith all attonce at him let fly  
> Their fluttring arrowes, thicke as flakes of snow,  
> And round about him flocke impetuously,  
> Like a great water flood, that tombling low  
> From the high mountaines, threats to ouerflow  
> With suddein fury all the fertile plaine,  
> And the sad husbandmans long hope doth throw  
> A downe the streame, and all his vowes make vaine,  
> Nor bounds nor banks his headlong ruine may sustaine.
>
> Vpon his shield their heaped hayle he bore,  
> And with his sword disperst the raskall flockes,  
> Which fled a sunder, and him fell before,  
> As withered leaues drop from their dried stockes,  
> Whẽ the wroth Western wind does reaue their locks;  
> And vnder neath him his courageous steed,  
> The fierce *Spumador* trode them downe like docks,  
> The fierce *Spumador* borne of heauenly seed:  
> Such as *Laomedon* of *Phoebus* race did breed.
>
> Which suddeine horrour and confused cry,  
> When as their Captaine heard, in haste he yode,  
> The cause to weet, and fault to remedy;  
> Vpon a Tygre swift and fierce he rode,  
> That as the winde ran vnderneath his lode,  
> Whiles his long legs nigh raught vnto the ground;  
> Full large he was of limbe, and shoulders brode,  
> But of such subtile substance and vnsound,  
> That like a ghost he seem'd, whose graue-clothes were vnbound.
>
> And in his hand a bended bow was seene,  
> And many arrowes vnder his right side,  
> All deadly daungerous, all cruell keene,  
> Headed with flint, and feathers bloudie dide,  
> Such as the *Indians* in their quiuers hide;  
> Those could he well direct and streight as line,  
> And bid them strike the marke, which he had eyde,  
> Ne was their salue, ne was their medicine,  
> That mote recure their wounds: so inly they did tine.
>
> As pale and wan as ashes was his looke,  
> His bodie leane and meagre as a rake,  
> And skin all withered like a dryed rooke,  
> Thereto as cold and drery as a Snake,  
> That seem'd to tremble euermore, and quake:  
> All in a canuas thin he was bedight,  
> And girded with a belt of twisted brake,  
> Vpon his head he wore an Helmet light,  
> Made of a dead mans skull, that seem'd a ghastly sight.
>
> *Maleger* was his name, and after him,  
> There follow'd fast at hand two wicked Hags,  
> With hoarie lockes all loose, and visage grim;  
> Their feet vnshod, their bodies wrapt in rags,  
> And both as swift on foot, as chased Stags;  
> And yet the one her other legge had lame,  
> Which with a staffe, all full of litle snags  
> She did support, and *Impotence* her name:  
> But th'other was *Impatience*, arm'd with raging flame.
>
> Soone as the Carle from farre the Prince espyde,  
> Glistring in armes and warlike ornament,  
> His Beast he felly prickt on either syde,  
> And his mischieuous bow full readie bent,  
> With which at him a cruell shaft he sent:  
> But he was warie, and it warded well  
> Vpon his shield, that it no further went,  
> But to the ground the idle quarrell fell:  
> Then he another and another did expell.
>
> Which to preuent, the Prince his mortall speare  
> Soone to him raught, and fierce at him did ride,  
> To be auenged of that shot whyleare:  
> But he was not so hardie to abide  
> That bitter stownd, but turning quicke aside  
> His light-foot beast, fled fast away for feare:  
> Whom to pursue, the Infant after hide,  
> So fast as his good Courser could him beare,  
> But labour lost it was, to weene approch him neare.
>
> For as the winged wind his Tigre fled,  
> That vew of eye could scarse him ouertake,  
> Ne scarse his feet on ground were seene to tred;  
> Through hils and dales he speedie way did make,  
> Ne hedge ne ditch his readie passage brake,  
> And in his flight the villein turn'd his face,  
> (As wonts the *Tartar* by the *Caspian* lake,  
> When as the *Russian* him in fight does chace)  
> Vnto his Tygres taile, and shot at him apace.
>
> Apace he shot, and yet he fled apace,  
> Still as the greedy knight nigh to him drew,  
> And oftentimes he would relent his pace,  
> That him his foe more fiercely should pursew:  
> Who when his vncouth manner he did vew,  
> He gan auize to follow him no more,  
> But keepe his standing, and his shaftes eschew,  
> Vntill he quite had spent his perlous store,  
> And then assayle him fresh, ere he could shift for more.
>
> But that lame Hag, still as abroad he strew  
> His wicked arrowes, gathered them againe,  
> And to him brought, fresh battell to renew:  
> Which he espying, cast her to restraine  
> From yielding succour to that cursed Swaine,  
> And her attaching, thought her hands to tye;  
> But soone as him dismounted on the plaine,  
> That other Hag did farre away espy  
> Binding her sister, she to him ran hastily.
>
> And catching hold of him, as downe he lent,  
> Him backward ouerthrew, and downe him stayd  
> With their rude hands and griesly graplement,  
> Till that the villein comming to their ayd,  
> Vpon him fell, and lode vpon him layd;  
> Full litle wanted, but he had him slaine,  
> And of the battell balefull end had made,  
> Had not his gentle Squire beheld his paine,  
> And commen to his reskew, ere his bitter bane.
>
> So greatest and most glorious thing on ground  
> May often need the helpe of weaker hand;  
> So feeble is mans state, and life vnsound,  
> That in assurance it may neuer stand,  
> Till it dissolued be from earthly band.  
> Proofe be thou Prince, the prowest man aliue,  
> And noblest borne of all in *Britayne* land;  
> Yet thee fierce Fortune did so nearely driue,  
> That had not grace thee blest, thou shouldest not suruiue.
>
> The Squire arriuing, fiercely in his armes  
> Snatcht first the one, and then the other Iade,  
> His chiefest lets and authors of his harmes,  
> And them perforce withheld with threatned blade,  
> Least that his Lord they should behind inuade;  
> The whiles the Prince prickt with reprochfull shame,  
> As one awakt out of long slombring shade,  
> Reuiuing thought of glorie and of fame,  
> Vnited all his powres to purge himselfe from blame.
>
> Like as a fire, the which in hollow caue  
> Hath long bene vnderkept, and downe supprest,  
> With murmurous disdaine doth inly raue,  
> And grudge, in so streight prison to be prest,  
> At last breakes forth with furious vnrest,  
> And striues to mount vnto his natiue seat;  
> All that did earst it hinder and molest,  
> It now deuoures with flames and scorching heat,  
> And carries into smoake with rage and horror great.
>
> So mightily the *Briton* Prince him rouzd  
> Out of his hold, and broke his caitiue bands,  
> And as a Beare whom angry curres haue touzd,  
> Hauing off-shakt them, and escapt their hands,  
> Becomes more fell, and all that him withstands  
> Treads downe and ouerthrowes. Now had the Carle  
> Alighted from his Tigre, and his hands  
> Discharged of his bow and deadly quar'le,  
> To seize vpon his foe flat lying on the marle.
>
> Which now him turnd to disauantage deare;  
> For neither can he fly, nor other harme,  
> But trust vnto his strength and manhood meare,  
> Sith now he is farre from his monstrous swarme,  
> And of his weapons did himselfe disarme.  
> The knight yet wrothfull for his late disgrace,  
> Fiercely aduaunst his valorous right arme,  
> And him so sore smote with his yron mace,  
> That groueling to the ground he fell, and fild his place.
>
> Well weened he, that field was then his owne,  
> And all his labour brought to happie end,  
> When suddein vp the villein ouerthrowne,  
> Out of his swowne arose, fresh to contend,  
> And gan himselfe to second battell bend,  
> As hurt he had not bene. Thereby there lay  
> An huge great stone, which stood vpon one end,  
> And had not bene remoued many a day;  
> Some land-marke seem'd to be, or signe of sundry way.
>
> The same he snatcht, and with exceeding sway  
> Threw at his foe, who was right well aware  
> To shunne the engin of his meant decay;  
> It booted not to thinke that throw to beare,  
> But ground he gaue, and lightly leapt areare:  
> Eft fierce returning, as a Faulcon faire  
> That once hath failed of her souse full neare,  
> Remounts againe into the open aire,  
> And vnto better fortune doth her selfe prepaire.
>
> So braue returning, with his brandisht blade,  
> He to the Carle himselfe againe addrest,  
> And strooke at him so sternely, that he made  
> An open passage through his riuen brest,  
> That halfe the steele behind his back did rest;  
> Which drawing backe, he looked euermore  
> When the hart bloud should gush out of his chest,  
> Or his dead corse should fall vpon the flore;  
> But his dead corse vpon the flore fell nathemore.
>
> Ne drop of bloud appeared shed to bee,  
> All were the wounde so wide and wonderous,  
> That through his carkasse one might plainely see:  
> Halfe in a maze with horror hideous,  
> And halfe in rage, to be deluded thus,  
> Againe through both the sides he strooke him quight,  
> That made his spright to grone full piteous:  
> Yet nathemore forth fled his groning spright,  
> But freshly as at first, prepard himselfe to fight.
>
> Thereat he smitten was with great affright,  
> And trembling terror did his hart apall,  
> Ne wist he, what to thinke of that same sight,  
> Ne what to say, ne what to doe at all;  
> He doubted, least it were some magicall  
> Illusion, that did beguile his sense,  
> Or wandring ghost, that wanted funerall,  
> Or aerie spirit vnder false pretence,  
> Or hellish feend raysd vp through diuelish science.
>
> His wonder farre exceeded reasons reach,  
> That he began to doubt his dazeled sight,  
> And oft of error did himselfe appeach:  
> Flesh without bloud, a person without spright,  
> Wounds without hurt, a bodie without might,  
> That could doe harme, yet could not harmed bee,  
> That could not die, yet seem'd a mortall wight,  
> That was most strong in most infirmitee;  
> Like did he neuer heare, like did he neuer see.
>
> A while he stood in this astonishment,  
> Yet would he not for all his great dismay  
> Giue ouer to effect his first intent,  
> And th'vtmost meanes of victorie assay,  
> Or th'vtmost issew of his owne decay.  
> His owne good sword *Morddure*, that neuer fayld  
> At need, till now, he lightly threw away,  
> And his bright shield, that nought him now auayld,  
> And with his naked hands him forcibly assayld.
>
> Twixt his two mightie armes him vp he snatcht,  
> And crusht his carkasse so against his brest,  
> That the disdainfull soule he thence dispatcht,  
> And th'idle breath all vtterly exprest:  
> Tho when he felt him dead, a downe he kest  
> The lumpish corse vnto the senselesse grownd;  
> Adowne he kest it with so puissant wrest,  
> That backe againe it did aloft rebownd,  
> And gaue against his mother earth a gronefull sownd.
>
> As when *Ioues* harnesse-bearing Bird from hie  
> Stoupes at a flying heron with proud disdaine,  
> The stone-dead quarrey fals so forciblie,  
> That it rebounds against the lowly plaine,  
> A second fall redoubling backe againe.  
> Then thought the Prince all perill sure was past,  
> And that he victor onely did remaine;  
> No sooner thought, then that the Carle as fast  
> Gan heap huge strokes on him, as ere he downe was cast.
>
> Nigh his wits end then woxe th'amazed knight,  
> And thought his labour lost and trauell vaine,  
> Against this lifelesse shadow so to fight:  
> Yet life he saw, and felt his mightie maine,  
> That whiles he marueild still, did still him paine:  
> For thy he gan some other wayes aduize,  
> How to take life from that dead-liuing swaine,  
> Whom still he marked freshly to arize  
> From th'earth, & from her wombe new spirits to reprize.
>
> He then remembred well, that had bene sayd,  
> How th'Earth his mother was, and first him bore;  
> She eke so often, as his life decayd,  
> Did life with vsury to him restore,  
> And raysd him vp much stronger then before,  
> So soone as he vnto her wombe did fall;  
> Therefore to ground he would him cast no more,  
> Ne him commit to graue terrestriall,  
> But beare him farre from hope of succour vsuall.
>
> Tho vp he caught him twixt his puissant hands,  
> And hauing scruzd out of his carrion corse  
> The lothfull life, now loosd from sinfull bands,  
> Vpon his shoulders carried him perforse  
> Aboue three furlongs, taking his full course,  
> Vntill he came vnto a standing lake;  
> Him thereinto he threw without remorse,  
> Ne stird, till hope of life did him forsake;  
> So end of that Carles dayes, and his owne paines did make.
>
> Which when those wicked Hags from farre did spy,  
> Like two mad dogs they ran about the lands,  
> And th'one of them with dreadfull yelling cry,  
> Throwing away her broken chaines and bands,  
> And hauing quencht her burning fier brands,  
> Hedlong her selfe did cast into that lake;  
> But *Impotence* with her owne wilfull hands,  
> One of *Malegers* cursed darts did take,  
> So riu'd her trembling hart, and wicked end did make.
>
> Thus now alone he conquerour remaines;  
> Tho comming to his Squire, that kept his steed,  
> Thought to haue mounted, but his feeble vaines  
> Him faild thereto, and serued not his need,  
> Through losse of bloud, which from his wounds did bleed,  
> That he began to faint, and life decay:  
> But his good Squire him helping vp with speed,  
> With stedfast hand vpon his horse did stay,  
> And led him to the Castle by the beaten way.
>
> Where many Groomes and Squiers readie were,  
> To take him from his steed full tenderly,  
> And eke the fairest *Alma* met him there  
> With balme and wine and costly spicery,  
> To comfort him in his infirmity;  
> Eftsoones she causd him vp to be conuayd,  
> And of his armes despoyled easily,  
> In sumptuous bed she made him to be layd,  
> And all the while his wounds were dressing, by him stayd.
