<blockquote>
<i>Fayre Pastorella by great hap<br>
her parents vnderstands:<br>
Calidore doth the Blatant beast<br>
subdew, and bynd in bands.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
L
Ike as a ship, that through the Ocean wyde<br>
Directs her course vnto one certaine cost,<br>
Is met of many a counter winde and tyde,<br>
With which her winged speed is let and crost,<br>
And she her selfe in stormie surges tost;<br>
Yet making many a borde, and many a bay,<br>
Still winneth way, ne hath her compasse lost:<br>
Right so it fares with me in this long way,<br>
Whose course is often stayd, yet neuer is astray.<p>

For all that hetherto hath long delayd<br>
This gentle knight, from sewing his first quest,<br>
Though out of course, yet hath not bene mis-sayd,<br>
To shew the courtesie by him profest,<br>
Euen vnto the lowest and the least.<br>
But now I come into my course againe,<br>
To his atchieuement of the <i>Blatant beast</i>;<br>
Who all this while at will did range and raine,<br>
Whilst none was him to stop, nor none him to restraine.<p>

Sir <i>Calidore</i> when thus he now had raught<br>
Faire <i>Pastorella</i> from those <i>Brigants</i> powre,<br>
Vnto the Castle of <i>Belgard</i> her brought,<br>
Whereof was Lord the good Sir <i>Bellamoure</i>;<br>
Who whylome was in his youthes freshest flowre<br>
A lustie knight, as euer wielded speare,<br>
And had endured many a dreadfull stoure<br>
In bloudy battell for a Ladie deare,<br>
The fayrest Ladie then of all that liuing were.<p>

Her name was <i>Claribell</i>: whose father hight<br>
The Lord of <i>Many Ilands</i>, farre renound<br>
For his great riches and his greater might.<br>
He through the wealth, wherein he did abound,<br>
This daughter thought in wedlocke to haue bound<br>
Vnto the Prince of <i>Picteland</i> bordering nere,<br>
But she whose sides before with secret wound<br>
Of loue to <i>Bellamoure</i> empierced were,<br>
By all meanes shund to match with any forrein fere.<p>

And <i>Bellamour</i> againe so well her pleased,<br>
With dayly seruice and attendance dew,<br>
That of her loue he was entyrely seized,<br>
And closely did her wed, but knowne to few.<br>
Which when her father vnderstood, he grew<br>
In so great rage, that them in dongeon deepe<br>
Without compassion cruelly he threw;<br>
Ye did so streightly them a sunder keepe,<br>
That neither could to company of th'other creepe.<p>

Nathlesse Sir <i>Bellamour</i>, whether through grace<br>
Or secret guifts so with his keepers wrought,<br>
That to his loue sometimes he came in place,<br>
Whereof her wombe vnwist to wight was fraught,<br>
And in dew time a mayden child forth brought.<br>
Which she streight way for dread least, if her syre<br>
Should know thereof, to slay he would haue sought,<br>
Deliuered to her handmayd, that for hyre<br>
She should it cause be fostred vnder straunge attyre.<p>

The trustie damzell bearing it abrode<br>
Into the emptie fields, where liuing wight<br>
Mote not bewray the secret of her lode,<br>
She forth gan lay vnto the open light<br>
The litle babe, to take thereof a sight.<br>
Whom whylest she did with watrie eyne behold,<br>
Vpon the litle brest like christall bright,<br>
She mote perceiue a litle purple mold,<br>
That like a rose her silken leaues did faire vnfold.<p>

Well she it markt, and pittied the more,<br>
Yet could not remedie her wretched case;<br>
But closing it againe like as before,<br>
Bedeaw'd with teares there left it in the place:<br>
Yet left not quite, but drew a litle space<br>
Behind the bushes, where she her did hyde,<br>
To weet what mortall hand, or heauens grace<br>
Would for the wretched infants helpe prouyde,<br>
For which it loudly cald, and pittifully cryde.<p>

At length a Shepheard, which there by did keepe<br>
His fleecie flocke vpon the playnes around,<br>
Led with the infants cry, that loud did weepe,<br>
Came to the place, where when he wrapped found<br>
Th'abandond spoyle, he softly it vnbound;<br>
And seeing there, that did him pittie sore,<br>
He tooke it vp, and in his mantle wound;<br>
So home vnto his honest wife it bore,<br>
Who as her owne it nurst, and named euermore.<p>

Thus long continu'd <i>Claribell</i> a thrall,<br>
And <i>Bellamour</i> in bands, till that her syre<br>
Departed life, and left vnto them all.<br>
Then all the stormes of fortunes former yre<br>
Were turnd, and they to freedome did retyre.<br>
Thenceforth they ioy'd in happinesse together,<br>
And liued long in peace and loue entyre,<br>
Without disquiet or dislike of ether,<br>
Till time that <i>Calidore</i> brought <i>Pastorella</i> thether.<p>

Both whom they goodly well did entertaine;<br>
For <i>Bellamour</i> knew <i>Calidore</i> right well,<br>
And loued for his prowesse, sith they twaine<br>
Long since had fought in field.  Als <i>Claribell</i><br>
No lesse did tender the faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
Seeing her weake and wan, through durance long.<br>
There they a while together thus did dwell<br>
In much delight, and many ioyes among,<br>
Vntill the damzell gan to wex more sound and strong.<p>

Tho gan Sir <i>Calidore</i> him to aduize<br>
Of his first quest, which he had long forlore;<br>
Asham'd to thinke, how he that enterprize,<br>
The which the Faery Queene had long afore<br>
Bequeath'd to him, forslacked had so sore;<br>
That much he feared, least reprochfull blame<br>
With foule dishonour him mote blot therefore;<br>
Besides the losse of so much loos and fame,<br>
As through the world thereby should glorifie his name.<p>

Therefore resoluing to returne in hast<br>
Vnto so great atchieuement, he bethought<br>
To leaue his Loue, now perill being past,<br>
With <i>Claribell</i>, whylest he that monster sought<br>
Throughout the world, and to destruction brought.<br>
So taking leaue of his faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
Whom to recomfort, all the meanes he wrought,<br>
With thanks to <i>Bellamour</i> and <i>Claribell</i>,<br>
He went forth on his quest, and did, that him befell.<p>

But first, ere I doe his aduentures tell,<br>
In this exploite, me needeth to declare,<br>
What did betide to the faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
During his absence left in heauy care,<br>
Through daily mourning, and nightly misfare:<br>
Yet did that auncient matrone all she might,<br>
To cherish her with all things choice and rare;<br>
And her owne handmayd, that <i>Melissa</i> hight,<br>
Appointed to attend her dewly day and night.<p>

Who in a morning, when this Mayden faire<br>
Was dighting her, hauing her snowy brest<br>
As yet not laced, nor her golden haire<br>
Into their comely tresses dewly drest,<br>
Chaunst to espy vpon her yuory chest<br>
The rosie marke, which she remembred well<br>
That litle Infant had, which forth she kest,<br>
The daughter of her Lady <i>Claribell</i>,<br>
The which she bore, the whiles in prison she did dwell.<p>

Which well auizing, streight she gan to cast<br>
In her conceiptfull mynd, that this faire Mayd<br>
Was that same infant, which so long sith past<br>
She in the open fields had loosely layd<br>
To Fortunes spoile, vnable it to ayd.<br>
So full of ioy, streight forth she ran in hast<br>
Vnto her mistresse, being halfe dismayd,<br>
To tell her, how the heauens had her graste,<br>
To saue her chylde, which in misfortunes mouth was plaste.<p>

The sober mother seeing such her mood,<br>
Yet knowing not, what meant that sodaine thro,<br>
Askt her, how mote her words be vnderstood,<br>
And what the matter was, that mou'd her so.<br>
My liefe (sayd she) ye know, that long ygo,<br>
Whilest ye in durance dwelt, ye to me gaue<br>
A little mayde, the which ye chylded tho;<br>
The same againe if now ye list to haue,<br>
The same is yonder Lady, whom high God did saue.<p>

Much was the Lady troubled at that speach,<br>
And gan to question streight how she it knew.<br>
Most certaine markes, (sayd she) do me it teach,<br>
For on her brest I with these eyes did vew<br>
The litle purple rose, which thereon grew,<br>
Whereof her name ye then to her did giue.<br>
Besides her countenaunce, and her likely hew,<br>
Matched with equall yeares, do surely prieue<br>
That yond same is your daughter sure, which yet doth liue.<p>

The matrone stayd no lenger to enquire,<br>
But forth in hast ran to the straunger Mayd;<br>
Whom catching greedily for great desire,<br>
Rent vp her brest, and bosome open layd,<br>
In which that rose she plainely saw displayd.<br>
Then her embracing twixt her armes twaine,<br>
She long so held, and softly weeping sayd;<br>
And liuest thou my daughter now againe?<br>
And art thou yet aliue, whom dead I long did faine.<p>

Tho further asking her of sundry things,<br>
And times comparing with their accidents,<br>
She found at last by very certaine signes,<br>
And speaking markes of passed monuments,<br>
That this young Mayd, whom chance to her presents<br>
Is her owne daughter, her owne infant deare.<br>
Tho wondring long at those so straunge euents,<br>
A thousand times she her embraced nere,<br>
With many a ioyfull kisse, and many a melting teare.<p>

Who euer is the mother of one chylde,<br>
Which hauing thought long dead, she fyndes aliue,<br>
Let her by proofe of that, which she hath fylde<br>
In her owne breast, this mothers ioy descriue:<br>
For other none such passion can contriue<br>
In perfect forme, as this good Lady felt,<br>
When she so faire a daughter saw suruiue,<br>
As <i>Pastorella</i> was, that nigh she swelt<br>
For passing ioy, which did all into pitty melt.<p>

Thence running forth vnto her loued Lord,<br>
She vnto him recounted, all that fell:<br>
Who ioyning ioy with her in one accord,<br>
Acknowledg'd for his owne faire <i>Pastorell</i>.<br>
There leaue we them in ioy, and let vs tell<br>
Of <i>Calidore</i>; who seeking all this while<br>
That monstrous Beast by finall force to quell,<br>
Through euery place, with restlesse paine and toile<br>
Him follow'd, by the tract of his outragious spoile.<p>

Through all estates he found that he had past,<br>
In which he many massacres had left,<br>
And to the Clergy now was come at last;<br>
In which such spoile, such hauocke, and such theft<br>
He wrought, that thence all goodnesse he bereft,<br>
That endlesse were to tell.  The Elfin Knight,<br>
Who now no place besides vnsought had left,<br>
At length into a Monastere did light,<br>
Where he him fo&#361;d despoyling all with maine &amp; might.<p>

Into their cloysters now he broken had,<br>
Through which the Monckes he chaced here &amp; there.<br>
And them pursu'd into their dortours sad,<br>
And searched all their cels and secrets neare;<br>
In which what filth and ordure did appeare,<br>
Were yrkesome to report; yet that foule Beast<br>
Nought sparing them, the more did tosse and teare,<br>
And ransacke all their dennes from most to least,<br>
Regarding nought religion, nor their holy heast.<p>

From thence into the sacred Church he broke,<br>
And robd the Chancell, and the deskes downe threw,<br>
And Altars fouled, and blasphemy spoke,<br>
And th'Images for all their goodly hew,<br>
Did cast to ground, whilest none was them to rew;<br>
So all confounded and disordered there.<br>
But seeing <i>Calidore</i>, away he flew,<br>
Knowing his fatall hand by former feare;<br>
But he him fast pursuing, soone approched neare.<p>

Him in a narrow place he ouertooke,<br>
And fierce assailing forst him turne againe:<br>
Sternely he turnd againe, when he him strooke<br>
With his sharpe steele, and ran at him amaine<br>
With open mouth, that seemed to containe<br>
A full good pecke within the vtmost brim,<br>
All set with yron teeth in raunges twaine,<br>
That terrifide his foes, and armed him,<br>
Appearing like the mouth of <i>Orcus</i> griesly grim.<p>

And therein were a thousand tongs empight,<br>
Of sundry kindes, and sundry quality;<br>
Some were of dogs, that barked day and night,<br>
And some of cats, that wrawling still did cry,<br>
And some of Beares, that groynd continually,<br>
And some of Tygres, that did seeme to gren,<br>
And snar at all, that euer passed by:<br>
But most of them were tongues of mortall men,<br>
Which spake reprochfully, not caring where nor when.<p>

And them amongst were mingled here and there,<br>
The tongues of Serpents with three forked stings,<br>
That spat out poyson and gore bloudy gere<br>
At all, that came within his rauenings,<br>
And spake licentious words, and hatefull things<br>
Of good and bad alike, of low and hie;<br>
Ne Kesars spared he a whit, nor Kings,<br>
But either blotted them with infamie,<br>
Or bit them with his banefull teeth of iniury.<p>

But <i>Calidore</i> thereof no whit afrayd,<br>
Rencountred him with so impetuous might,<br>
That th'outrage of his violence he stayd,<br>
And bet abacke, threatning in vaine to bite,<br>
And spitting forth the poyson of his spight,<br>
That fomed all about his bloody iawes.<br>
Tho rearing vp his former feete on hight,<br>
He rampt vpon him with his rauenous pawes,<br>
As if he would haue rent him with his cruell clawes.<p>

But he right well aware, his rage to ward,<br>
Did cast his shield atweene, and therewithall<br>
Putting his puissaunce forth, pursu'd so hard,<br>
That backeward he enforced him to fall:<br>
And being downe, ere he new helpe could call,<br>
His shield he on him threw, and fast downe held;<br>
Like as a bullocke, that in bloudy stall<br>
Of butchers balefull hand to ground is feld,<br>
Is forcibly kept downe, till he be throughly queld.<p>

Full cruelly the Beast did rage and rore,<br>
To be downe held, and maystred so with might,<br>
That he gan fret and fome out bloudy gore,<br>
Striuing in vaine to rere him selfe vpright.<br>
For still the more he stroue, the more the Knight<br>
Did him suppresse, and forcibly subdew;<br>
That made him almost mad for fell despight.<br>
He grind, hee bit, he scratcht, he venim threw,<br>
And fared like a feend, right horrible in hew.<p>

Or like the hell-borne <i>Hydra</i>, which they faine<br>
That great <i>Alcides</i> whilome ouerthrew,<br>
After that he had labourd long in vaine,<br>
To crop his thousand heads, the which still new<br>
Forth budded, and in greater number grew.<br>
Such was the fury of this hellish Beast,<br>
Whilest <i>Calidore</i> him vnder him downe threw;<br>
Who nathemore his heauy load releast,<br>
But aye the more he rag'd, the more his powre increast.<p>

Tho when the Beast saw, he mote nought auaile,<br>
By force, he gan his hundred tongues apply,<br>
And sharpely at him to reuile and raile,<br>
With bitter termes of shamefull infamy;<br>
Oft interlacing many a forged lie,<br>
Whose like he neuer once did speake, nor heare,<br>
Nor euer thought thing so vnworthily:<br>
Yet did he nought for all that him forbeare,<br>
But strained him so streightly, that he chokt him neare.<p>

At last when as he found his force to shrincke,<br>
And rage to quaile, he tooke a muzzell strong<br>
Of surest yron, made with many a lincke;<br>
Therewith he mured vp his mouth along,<br>
And therein shut vp his blasphemous tong,<br>
For neuer more defaming gentle Knight,<br>
Or vnto louely Lady doing wrong:<br>
And thereunto a great long chaine he tight,<br>
With which he drew him forth, euen in his own despight.<p>

Like as whylome that strong <i>Tirynthian</i> swaine,<br>
Brought forth with him the dreadfull dog of hell,<br>
Against his will fast bound in yron chaine,<br>
And roring horribly, did him compell<br>
To see the hatefull sunne, that he might tell<br>
To griesly <i>Pluto</i>, what on earth was donne,<br>
And to the other damned ghosts, which dwell<br>
For aye in darkenesse, which day light doth shonne:<br>
So led this Knight his captyue with like conquest wonne.<p>

Yet greatly did the Beast repine at those<br>
Straunge bands, whose like till then he neuer bore,<br>
Ne euer any durst till then impose,<br>
And chauffed inly, seeing now no more<br>
Him liberty was left aloud to rore:<br>
Yet durst he not draw backe; nor once withstand<br>
The proued powre of noble <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
But trembled vnderneath his mighty hand,<br>
And like a fearefull dog him followed through the land.<p>

Him through all Faery land he follow'd so,<br>
As if he learned had obedience long,<br>
That all the people where so he did go,<br>
Out of their townes did round about him throng,<br>
To see him leade that Beast in bondage strong,<br>
And seeing it, much wondred at the sight;<br>
And all such persons, as he earst did wrong,<br>
Reioyced much to see his captiue plight,<br>
And much admyr'd the Beast, but more admyr'd the Knight.<p>

Thus was this Monster by the maystring might<br>
Of doughty <i>Calidore</i>, supprest and tamed,<br>
That neuer more he mote endammadge wight<br>
With his vile tongue, which many had defamed,<br>
And many causelesse caused to be blamed:<br>
So did he eeke long after this remaine,<br>
Vntill that, whether wicked fate so framed,<br>
Or fault of men, he broke his yron chaine,<br>
And got into the world at liberty againe.<p>

Thenceforth more mischiefe and more scath he wrought<br>
To mortall men, then he had done before;<br>
Ne euer could by any more be brought<br>
Into like bands, ne maystred any more:<br>
Albe that long time after <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
The good Sir <i>Pelleas</i> him tooke in hand,<br>
And after him Sir <i>Lamoracke</i> of yore,<br>
And all his brethren borne in Britaine land;<br>
Yet none of them could euer bring him into band.<p>

So now he raungeth through the world againe,<br>
And rageth sore in each degree and state;<br>
Ne any is, that may him now restraine,<br>
He growen is so great and strong of late,<br>
Barking and biting all that him doe bate,<br>
Albe they worthy blame, or cleare of crime:<br>
Ne spareth he most learned wits to rate,<br>
Ne spareth he the gentle Poets rime,<br>
But rends without regard of person or of time.<p>

Ne may this homely verse, of many meanest,<br>
Hope to escape his venemous despite,<br>
More then my former writs, all were they clearest<br>
From blamefull blot, and free from all that wite,<br>
With which some wicked tongues did it backebite,<br>
And bring into a mighty Peres displeasure,<br>
That neuer so deserued to endite.<br>
Therfore do you my rimes keep better measure,<br>
And seeke to please, that now is counted wisemens threasure.<p>
