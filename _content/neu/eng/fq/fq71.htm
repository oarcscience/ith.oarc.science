VI. </i></center><p> 

<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>The Hermite heales both Squire and dame<br>
Of their sore maladies:<br>
He Turpine doth defeate, and shame<br>
For his late villanies.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
N
O wound, which warlike hand of enemy<br>
Inflicts with dint of sword, so sore doth light,<br>
As doth the poysnous sting, which Infamy<br>
Infixeth in the name of noble wight:<br>
For by no art, nor any leaches might<br>
It euer can recured be againe;<br>
Ne all the skill, which that immortall spright<br>
Of <i>Podalyrius</i> did in it retaine,<br>
Can remedy such hurts; such hurts are hellish paine.<p>

Such were the wounds, the which that <i>Blatant Beast</i><br>
Made in the bodies of that Squire and Dame;<br>
And being such, were now much more increast,<br>
For want of taking heede vnto the same,<br>
That now corrupt and curelesse they became.<br>
Howbe that carefull Hermite did his best,<br>
With many kindes of medicines meete, to tame<br>
The poysnous humour, which did most infest<br>
Their ranckling wounds, &amp; euery day them duely drest.<p>

For he right well in Leaches craft was seene,<br>
And through the long experience of his dayes,<br>
Which had in many fortunes tossed beene,<br>
And past through many perillous assayes,<br>
He knew the diuerse went of mortall wayes,<br>
And in the mindes of men had great insight;<br>
Which with sage counsell, when they went astray,<br>
He could enforme, and them reduce aright,<br>
And al the passi&otilde;s heale, which wo&#361;d the weaker spright.<p>

For whylome he had bene a doughty Knight,<br>
As any one, that liued in his daies,<br>
And proued oft in many perillous fight,<br>
Of which he grace and glory wonne alwaies,<br>
And in all battels bore away the baies.<br>
But being now attacht with timely age,<br>
And weary of this worlds vnquiet waies,<br>
He tooke him selfe vnto this Hermitage,<br>
In which he liu'd alone, like carelesse bird in cage.<p>

One day, as he was searching of their wounds,<br>
He found that they had festred priuily,<br>
And ranckling inward with vnruly stounds,<br>
The inner parts now gan to putrify,<br>
That quite they seem'd past helpe of surgery,<br>
And rather needed to be disciplinde<br>
With holesome reede of sad sobriety,<br>
To rule the stubborne rage of passion blinde:<br>
Giue salues to euery sore, but counsell to the minde.<p>

So taking them apart into his cell,<br>
He to that point fit speaches gan to frame,<br>
As he the art of words knew wondrous well,<br>
And eke could doe, as well as say the same,<br>
And thus he to them sayd; Faire daughter Dame,<br>
And you faire sonne, which here thus long now lie<br>
In piteous languor, since ye hither came,<br>
In vaine of me ye hope for remedie,<br>
And I likewise in vaine doe salues to you applie.<p>

For in your selfe your onely helpe doth lie,<br>
To heale your selues, and must proceed alone<br>
From your owne will, to cure your maladie.<br>
Who can him cure, that will be cur'd of none?<br>
If therefore health ye seeke, obserue this one.<br>
First learne your outward sences to refraine<br>
From things, that stirre vp fraile affection;<br>
Your eies, your eares, your tongue, your talk restraine<br>
From that they most affect, and in due termes containe.<p>

For from those outward sences ill affected,<br>
The seede of all this euill first doth spring,<br>
Which at the first before it had infected,<br>
Mote easie be supprest with little thing:<br>
But being growen strong, it forth doth bring<br>
Sorrow, and anguish, and impatient paine<br>
In th'inner parts, and lastly scattering<br>
Contagious poyson close through euery vaine,<br>
It neuer rests, till it haue wrought his finall bane.<p>

For that beastes teeth, which wounded you tofore,<br>
Are so exceeding venemous and keene,<br>
Made all of rusty yron, ranckling sore,<br>
That where they bite, it booteth not to weene<br>
With salue, or antidote, or other mene<br>
It euer to amend: ne maruaile ought;<br>
For that same beast was bred of hellish strene,<br>
And long in darksome <i>Stygian</i> den vpbrought,<br>
Begot of foule <i>Echidna</i>, as in bookes is taught.<p>

<i>Echidna</i> is a Monster direfull dred,<br>
Whom Gods doe hate, and heauens abhor to see;<br>
So hideous is her shape, so huge her hed,<br>
That euen the hellish fiends affrighted bee<br>
At sight thereof, and from her presence flee:<br>
Yet did her face and former parts professe<br>
A faire young Mayden, full of comely glee;<br>
But all her hinder parts did plaine expresse<br>
A monstrous Dragon, full of fearefull vglinesse.<p>

To her the Gods, for her so dreadfull face,<br>
In fearefull darkenesse, furthest from the skie,<br>
And from the earth, appointed haue her place,<br>
Mongst rocks and caues, where she enrold doth lie<br>
In hideous horrour and obscurity,<br>
Wasting the strength of her immortall age.<br>
There did <i>Typhaon</i> with her company;<br>
Cruell <i>Typhaon</i>, whose tempestuous rage<br>
Make th'heauens tremble oft, &amp; him with vowes asswage.<p>

Of that commixtion they did then beget<br>
This hellish Dog, that hight the <i>Blatant Beast</i>;<br>
A wicked Monster, that his tongue doth whet<br>
Gainst all, both good and bad, both most and least,<br>
And poures his poysnous gall forth to infest<br>
The noblest wights with notable defame:<br>
Ne euer Knight, that bore so lofty creast,<br>
Ne euer Lady of so honest name,<br>
But he them spotted with reproch, or secrete shame.<p>

In vaine therefore it were, with medicine<br>
To goe about to salue such kynd of sore,<br>
That rather needes wise read and discipline,<br>
Then outward salues, that may augment it more.<br>
Aye me (sayd then <i>Serena</i> sighing sore)<br>
What hope of helpe doth then for vs remaine,<br>
If that no salues may vs to health restore?<br>
But sith we need good counsell (sayd the swaine)<br>
Aread good sire, some counsell, that may vs sustaine.<p>

The best (sayd he) that I can you aduize,<br>
Is to auoide the occasion of the ill:<br>
For when the cause, whence euill doth arize,<br>
Remoued is, th'effect surceaseth still.<br>
Abstaine from pleasure, and restraine your will,<br>
Subdue desire, and bridle loose delight,<br>
Vse scanted diet, and forbeare your fill,<br>
Shun secresie, and talke in open sight:<br>
So shall you soone repaire your present euill plight.<p>

Thus hauing sayd, his sickely patients<br>
Did gladly hearken to his graue beheast,<br>
And kept so well his wise commaundements,<br>
That in short space their malady was ceast,<br>
And eke the biting of that harmefull Beast<br>
Was throughly heal'd.  Tho when they did perceaue<br>
Their wounds recur'd, and forces reincreast,<br>
Of that good Hermite both they tooke their leaue,<br>
And went both on their way, ne ech would other leaue.<p>

But each the other vow'd t'accompany,<br>
The Lady, for that she was much in dred,<br>
Now left alone in great extremity,<br>
The Squire, for that he courteous was indeed,<br>
Would not her leaue alone in her great need.<br>
So both together traueld, till they met<br>
With a faire Mayden clad in mourning weed,<br>
Vpon a mangy iade vnmeetely set,<br>
And a lewd foole her leading thorough dry and wet.<p>

But by what meanes that shame to her befell,<br>
And how thereof her selfe she did acquite,<br>
I must a while forbeare to you to tell;<br>
Till that, as comes by course, I doe recite,<br>
What fortune to the Briton Prince did lite,<br>
Pursuing that proud Knight, the which whileare<br>
Wrought to Sir <i>Calidore</i> so foule despight;<br>
And eke his Lady, though she sickely were,<br>
So lewdly had abusde, as ye did lately heare.<p>

The Prince according to the former token,<br>
Which faire <i>Serene</i> to him deliuered had,<br>
Pursu'd him streight, in mynd to bene ywroken<br>
Of all the vile demeane, and vsage bad,<br>
With which he had those two so ill bestad:<br>
Ne wight with him on that aduenture went,<br>
But that wylde man, whom though he oft forbad,<br>
Yet for no bidding, nor for being shent,<br>
Would he restrayned be from his attendement.<p>

Arriuing there, as did by chaunce befall,<br>
He found the gate wyde ope, and in he rode,<br>
Ne stayd, till that he came into the hall:<br>
Where soft dismounting like a weary lode,<br>
Vpon the ground with feeble feete he trode,<br>
As he vnable were for very neede<br>
To moue one foote, but there must make abode;<br>
The whiles the saluage man did take his steede,<br>
And in some stable neare did set him vp to feede.<p>

Ere long to him a homely groome there came,<br>
That in rude wise him asked, what he was,<br>
That durst so boldly, without let or shame,<br>
Into his Lords forbidden hall to passe.<br>
To whom the Prince, him fayning to embase,<br>
Mylde answer made; he was an errant Knight,<br>
The which was fall'n into this feeble case,<br>
Through many wounds, which lately he in fight<br>
Receiued had, and prayd to pitty his ill plight.<p>

But he, the more outrageous and bold,<br>
Sternely did bid him quickely thence auaunt,<br>
Or deare aby, for why his Lord of old<br>
Did hate all errant Knights, which there did haunt,<br>
Ne lodging would to any of them graunt:<br>
And therefore lightly bad him packe away,<br>
Not sparing him with bitter words to taunt;<br>
And therewithall rude hand on him did lay.<br>
To thrust him out of dore, doing his worst assay.<p>

Which when the Saluage comming now in place,<br>
Beheld, eftsoones he all enraged grew,<br>
And running streight vpon that villaine base,<br>
Like a fell Lion at him fiercely flew,<br>
And with his teeth and nailes, in present vew,<br>
Him rudely rent, and all to peeces tore:<br>
So miserably him all helpelesse slew,<br>
That with the noise, whilest he did loudly rore,<br>
The people of the house rose forth in great vprore.<p>

Who when on ground they saw their fellow slaine,<br>
And that same Knight and Saluage standing by,<br>
Vpon them two they fell with might and maine,<br>
And on them layd so huge and horribly,<br>
As if they would haue slaine them presently.<br>
But the bold Prince defended him so well,<br>
And their assault withstood so mightily,<br>
That maugre all their might, he did repell,<br>
And beat them back, whilest many vnderneath him fell.<p>

Yet he them still so sharpely did pursew,<br>
That few of them he left aliue, which fled,<br>
Those euill tidings to their Lord to shew.<br>
Who hearing how his people badly sped,<br>
Came forth in hast: where when as with the dead<br>
He saw the ground all strow'd, and that same Knight<br>
And saluage with their bloud fresh steeming red,<br>
He woxe nigh mad with wrath and fell despight,<br>
And with reprochfull words him thus bespake on hight;<p>

Art thou he, traytor, that with treason vile,<br>
Hast slaine my men in this vnmanly maner,<br>
And now triumphest in the piteous spoile<br>
Of these poore folk, whose soules with black dishonor<br>
And foule defame doe decke thy bloudy baner?<br>
The meede whereof shall shortly be thy shame,<br>
And wretched end, which still attendeth on her.<br>
With that him selfe to battell he did frame;<br>
So did his forty yeomen, which there with him came.<p>

With dreadfull force they all did him assaile,<br>
And round about with boystrous strokes oppresse,<br>
That on his shield did rattle like to haile<br>
In a great tempest; that in such distresse,<br>
He wist not to which side him to addresse.<br>
And euermore that crauen cowherd Knight<br>
Was at his backe with heartlesse heedinesse,<br>
Wayting if he vnwares him murther might:<br>
For cowardize doth still in villany delight.<p>

Whereof whenas the Prince was well aware,<br>
He to him turnd with furious intent,<br>
And him against his powre gan to prepare;<br>
Like a fierce Bull, that being busie bent<br>
To fight with many foes about him ment,<br>
Feeling some curre behinde his heeles to bite,<br>
Turnes him about with fell auengement;<br>
So likewise turnde the Prince vpon the Knight,<br>
And layd at him amaine with all his will and might.<p>

Who when he once his dreadfull strokes had tasted,<br>
Durst not the furie of his force abyde,<br>
But turn'd abacke, and to retyre him hasted<br>
Through the thick prease, there thinking him to hyde.<br>
But when the Prince had once him plainely eyde,<br>
He foot by foot him followed alway,<br>
Ne would him suffer once to shrinke asyde,<br>
But ioyning close, huge lode at him did lay:<br>
Who flying still did ward, and warding fly away.<p>

But when his foe he still so eger saw,<br>
Vnto his heeles himselfe he did betake,<br>
Hoping vnto some refuge to withdraw:<br>
Ne would the Prince him euer foot forsake,<br>
Where so he went, but after him did make.<br>
He fled from roome to roome, from place to place,<br>
Whylest euery ioynt for dread of death did quake,<br>
Still looking after him, that did him chace;<br>
That made him euermore increase his speedie pace.<p>

At last he vp into the chamber came,<br>
Whereas his loue was sitting all alone,<br>
Wayting what tydings of her folke became.<br>
There did the Prince him ouertake anone,<br>
Crying in vaine to her, him to bemone;<br>
And with his sword him on the head did smyte,<br>
That to the ground he fell in senselesse swone:<br>
Yet whether thwart or flatly it did lyte,<br>
The tempred steele did not into his braynepan byte.<p>

Which when the Ladie saw, with great affright<br>
She starting vp, began to shrieke aloud,<br>
And with her garment couering him from sight,<br>
Seem'd vnder her protection him to shroud;<br>
And falling lowly at his feet, her bowd<br>
Vpon her knee, intreating him for grace,<br>
And often him besought, and prayd, and vowd;<br>
That with the ruth of her so wretched case,<br>
He stayd his second strooke, and did his hand abase.<p>

Her weed she then withdrawing, did him discouer,<br>
Who now come to himselfe, yet would not rize,<br>
But still did lie as dead, and quake, and quiuer,<br>
That euen the Prince his basenesse did despize,<br>
And eke his Dame him seeing in such guize,<br>
Gan him recomfort, and from ground to reare.<br>
Who rising vp at last in ghastly wize,<br>
Like troubled ghost did dreadfully appeare,<br>
As one that had no life him left through former feare.<p>

Whom when the Prince so deadly saw dismayd,<br>
He for such basenesse shamefully him shent,<br>
And with sharpe words did bitterly vpbrayd;<br>
Vile cowheard dogge, now doe I much repent,<br>
That euer I this life vnto thee lent,<br>
Whereof thou caytiue so vnworthie art;<br>
That both thy loue, for lacke of hardiment,<br>
And eke thy selfe, for want of manly hart,<br>
And eke all knights hast shamed with this knightlesse part.<p>

Yet further hast thou heaped shame to shame,<br>
And crime to crime, by this thy cowheard feare.<br>
For first it was to thee reprochfull blame,<br>
To erect this wicked custome, which I heare,<br>
Gainst errant Knights and Ladies thou dost reare,<br>
Whom when thou mayst, thou dost of arms despoile,<br>
Or of their vpper garment, which they weare:<br>
Yet doest thou not with manhood, but with guile<br>
Maintaine this euill vse, thy foes thereby to foile.<p>

And lastly in approuance of thy wrong,<br>
To shew such faintnesse and foule cowardize,<br>
Is greatest shame: for oft it falles, that strong<br>
And valiant knights doe rashly enterprize,<br>
Either for fame, or else for exercize,<br>
A wrongfull quarrell to maintaine by fight;<br>
Yet haue, through prowesse and their braue emprize,<br>
Gotten great worship in this worldes sight.<br>
For greater force there needs to maintaine wrong, then right.<p>

Yet since thy life vnto this Ladie fayre<br>
I giuen haue, liue in reproch and scorne;<br>
Ne euer armes, ne euer knighthood dare<br>
Hence to professe: for shame is to adorne<br>
With so braue badges one so basely borne;<br>
But onely breath sith that I did forgiue.<br>
So hauing from his crauen bodie torne<br>
Those goodly armes, he them away did giue<br>
And onely suffred him this wretched life to liue.<p>

There whilest he thus was setling things aboue,<br>
Atwene that Ladie myld and recreant knight,<br>
To whom his life he graunted for her loue,<br>
He gan bethinke him, in what perilous plight<br>
He had behynd him left that saluage wight,<br>
Amongst so many foes, whom sure he thought<br>
By this quite slaine in so vnequall fight:<br>
Therefore descending backe in haste, he sought<br>
If yet he were aliue, or to destruction brought.<p>

There he him found enuironed about<br>
With slaughtred bodies, which his hand had slaine,<br>
And laying yet a fresh with courage stout<br>
Vpon the rest, that did aliue remaine;<br>
Whom he likewise right sorely did constraine,<br>
Like scattred sheepe, to seeke for safetie,<br>
After he gotten had with busie paine<br>
Some of their weapons, which thereby did lie,<br>
With which he layd about, and made them fast to flie.<p>

Whom when the Prince so felly saw to rage,<br>
Approching to him neare, his hand he stayd,<br>
And sought, by making signes, him to asswage:<br>
Whom them perceiuing, streight to him obayd,<br>
As to his Lord, and downe his weapons layd,<br>
As if he long had to his heasts bene trayned.<br>
Thence he him brought away, and vp conuayd<br>
Into the chamber, where that Dame remayned<br>
With her vnworthy knight, who ill him entertayned.<p>

Whom when the Saluage saw from daunger free,<br>
Sitting beside his Ladie there at ease,<br>
He well remembred, that the same was hee,<br>
Which lately sought his Lord for to displease:<br>
Tho all in rage, he on him streight did seaze,<br>
As if he would in peeces him haue rent;<br>
And were not, that the Prince did him appeaze,<br>
He had not left one limbe of him vnrent:<br>
But streight he held his hand at his commaundement.<p>

Thus hauing all things well in peace ordayned,<br>
The Prince himselfe there all that night did rest,<br>
Where him <i>Blandina</i> fayrely entertayned,<br>
With all the courteous glee and goodly feast,<br>
The which for him she could imagine best.<br>
For well she knew the wayes to win good will<br>
Of euery wight, that were not too infest,<br>
And how to please the minds of good and ill,<br>
Through tempering of her words &amp; lookes by wondrous skill.<p>

Yet were her words and lookes but false and fayned,<br>
To some hid end to make more easie way,<br>
Or to allure such fondlings, whom she trayned<br>
Into her trap vnto their owne decay:<br>
Thereto, when needed, she could weepe and pray,<br>
And when her listed, she could fawne and flatter;<br>
Now smyling smoothly, like to sommers day,<br>
Now glooming sadly, so to cloke her matter;<br>
Yet were her words but wynd, &amp; all her teares but water.<p>

Whether such grace were giuen her by kynd,<br>
As women wont their guilefull wits to guyde;<br>
Or learn'd the art to please, I doe not fynd.<br>
This well I wote, that she so well applyde<br>
Her pleasing tongue, that soone she pacifyde<br>
The wrathfull Prince, &amp; wrought her husbands peace,<br>
Who nathelesse not therewith satisfyde,<br>
His rancorous despight did not releasse,<br>
Ne secretly from thought of fell reuenge surceasse.<p>

For all that night, the whyles the Prince did rest<br>
In carelesse couch, not weeting what was ment,<br>
He watcht in close awayt with weapons prest,<br>
Willing to worke his villenous intent<br>
On him, that had so shamefully him shent:<br>
Yet durst he not for very cowardize<br>
Effect the same, whylest all the night was spent.<br>
The morrow next the Prince did early rize,<br>
And passed forth, to follow his first enterprise.<p>
