BOOKE OF THE  
FAERIE QVEENE.

*Contayning*  
THE LEGENDE OF THE  
KNIGHT OF THE RED CROSSE,  
*OR*  
OF HOLINESSE.

> LO I the man, whose Muse whilome did maske,  
>     As time her taught, in lowly Shepheards weeds,  
>     Am now enforst a far vnfitter taske,  
>     For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds,  
>     And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds;  
>     Whose prayses hauing slept in silence long,  
>     Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds  
>     To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:  
> Fierce warres and faithfull loues shall moralize my song.
>
> Helpe then, ô holy Virgin chiefe of nine,  
>     Thy weaker Nouice to performe thy will,  
>     Lay forth out of thine euerlasting scryne  
>     The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still,  
>     Of Faerie knights and fairest *Tanaquill*,  
>     Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long  
>     Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill,  
> That I must rue his vndeserued wrong:  
> O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong.
>
> And thou most dreaded impe of highest *Ioue*,  
>     Faire *Venus* sonne, that with thy cruell dart  
>     At that good knight so cunningly didst roue,  
>     That glorious fire it kindled in his hart,  
>     Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart,  
>     And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde:  
>     Come both, and with you bring triumphant *Mart*,  
>     In loues and gentle iollities arrayd,  
> After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd.
>
> And with them eke, O Goddesse heauenly bright,  
>     Mirrour of grace and Maiestie diuine,  
>     Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light  
>     Like *Phoebus* lampe throughout the world doth shine,  
>     Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne,  
>     And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile,  
>     To thinke of that true glorious type of thine,  
>     The argument of mine afflicted stile:  
> The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.
