*Cant. II.*

> *The guilefull great Enchaunter parts  
> The Redcrosse Knight from Truth:  
> Into whose stead faire falshood steps,  
> And workes him wofull ruth.*

> BY this the Northerne wagoner had set  
>     His seuenfold teme behind the stedfast starre,  
>     That was in Ocean waues yet neuer wet,  
>     But firme is fixt, and sendeth light from farre  
>     To all, that in the wide deepe wandring arre:  
>     And chearefull Chaunticlere with his note shrill  
>     Had warned once, that *Phoebus* fiery carre  
>     In hast was climbing vp the Easterne hill,  
> Full enuious that night so long his roome did fill.
>
> When those accursed messengers of hell,  
>     That feigning dreame, and that faire-forged Spright  
>     Came to their wicked maister, and gan tell  
>     Their bootelesse paines, and ill succeeding night:  
>     Who all in rage to see his skilfull might  
>     Deluded so, gan threaten hellish paine  
>     And sad *Proserpines* wrath, them to affright.  
>     But when he saw his threatning was but vaine,  
> He cast about, and searcht his balefull bookes againe.
>
> Eftsoones he tooke that miscreated faire,  
>     And that false other Spright, on whom he spred  
>     A seeming body of the subtile aire,  
>     Like a young Squire, in loues and lusty-hed  
>     His wanton dayes that euer loosely led,  
>     Without regard of armes and dreaded fight:  
>     Those two he tooke, and in a secret bed,  
>     Couered with darknesse and misdeeming night,  
> Them both together laid, to ioy in vaine delight.
>
> Forthwith he runnes with feigned faithfull hast  
>     Vnto his guest, who after troublous sights  
>     And dreames, gan now to take more sound repast,  
>     Whom suddenly he wakes with fearefull frights,  
>     As one aghast with feends or damned sprights,  
>     And to him cals, Rise rise vnhappy Swaine,  
>     That here wex old in sleepe, whiles wicked wights  
>     Haue knit themselues in *Venus* shamefull chaine;  
> Come see, where your false Lady doth her honour staine.
>
> All in amaze he suddenly vp start  
>     With sword in hand, and with the old man went;  
>     Who soone him brought into a secret part,  
>     Where that false couple were full closely ment  
>     In wanton lust and lewd embracement:  
>     Which when he saw, he burnt with gealous fire,  
>     The eye of reason was with rage yblent,  
>     And would haue slaine them in his furious ire,  
> But hardly was restreined of that aged sire.
>
> Returning to his bed in torment great,  
>     And bitter anguish of his guiltie sight,  
>     He could not rest, but did his stout heart eat,  
>     And wast his inward gall with deepe despight,  
>     Yrkesome of life, and too long lingring night.  
>     At last faire *Hesperus* in highest skie  
>     Had spent his lampe, and brought forth dawning light,  
>     Then vp he rose, and clad him hastily;  
> The Dwarfe him brought his steed: so both away do fly.
>
> Now when the rosy-fingred Morning faire,  
>     Weary of aged *Tithones* saffron bed,  
>     Had spred her purple robe through deawy aire,  
>     And the high hils *Titan* discouered,  
>     The royall virgin shooke off drowsy-hed,  
>     And rising forth out of her baser bowre,  
>     Lookt for her knight, who far away was fled,  
>     And for her Dwarfe, that wont to wait each houre;  
> Then gan she waile and weepe, to see that woefull stowre.
>
> And after him she rode with so much speede  
>     As her slow beast could make; but all in vaine:  
>     For him so far had borne his light-foot steede,  
>     Pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdaine,  
>     That him to follow was but fruitlesse paine;  
>     Yet she her weary limbes would neuer rest,  
>     But euery hill and dale, each wood and plaine  
>     Did search, sore grieued in her gentle brest,  
> He so vngently left her, whom she loued best.
>
> But subtill *Archimago*, when his guests  
>     He saw diuided into double parts,  
>     And *Vna* wandring in woods and forrests,  
>     Th'end of his drift, he praisd his diuelish arts,  
>     That had such might ouer true meaning harts;  
>     Yet rests not so, but other meanes doth make,  
>     How he may worke vnto her further smarts:  
>     For her he hated as the hissing snake,  
> And in her many troubles did most pleasure take.
>
> He then deuisde himselfe how to disguise;  
>     For by his mightie science he could take  
>     As many formes and shapes in seeming wise,  
>     As euer *Proteus* to himselfe could make:  
>     Sometime a fowle, sometime a fish in lake,  
>     Now like a foxe, now like a dragon fell,  
>     That of himselfe he oft for feare would quake,  
>     And oft would flie away. O who can tell  
> The hidden power of herbes, and might of Magicke spell?
>
> But now seemde best, the person to put on  
>     Of that good knight, his late beguiled guest:  
>     In mighty armes he was yclad anon,  
>     And siluer shield vpon his coward brest  
>     A bloudy crosse, and on his crauen crest  
>     A bounch of haires discolourd diuersly:  
>     Full iolly knight he seemde, and well addrest,  
>     And when he sate vpon his courser free,  
> *Saint George* himself ye would haue deemed him to be.
>
> But he the knight, whose semblaunt he did beare,  
>     The true *Saint George* was wandred far away,  
>     Still flying from his thoughts and gealous feare;  
>     Will was his guide, and griefe led him astray.  
>     At last him chaunst to meete vpon the way  
>     A faithlesse Sarazin all arm'd to point,  
>     In whose great shield was writ with letters gay  
>     *Sans foy*: full large of limbe and euery ioint  
> He was, and cared not for God or man a point.
>
> He had a faire companion of his way,  
>     A goodly Lady clad in scarlot red,  
>     Purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay,  
>     And like a *Persian* mitre on her hed  
>     She wore, with crownes and owches garnished,  
>     The which her lauish louers to her gaue;  
>     Her wanton palfrey all was ouerspred  
>     With tinsell trappings, wouen like a waue,  
> Whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses braue.
>
> With faire disport and courting dalliaunce  
>     She intertainde her louer all the way:  
>     But when she saw the knight his speare aduaunce,  
>     She soone left off her mirth and wanton play,  
>     And bad her knight addresse him to the fray:  
>     His foe was nigh at hand. He prickt with pride  
>     And hope to winne his Ladies heart that day,  
>     Forth spurred fast: adowne his coursers side  
> The red bloud trickling staind the way, as he did ride.
>
> The knight of the *Redcrosse* when him he spide,  
>     Spurring so hote with rage dispiteous,  
>     Gan fairely couch his speare, and towards ride:  
>     Soone meete they both, both fell and furious,  
>     That daunted with their forces hideous,  
>     Their steeds do stagger, and amazed stand,  
>     And eke themselues too rudely rigorous,  
>     Astonied with the stroke of their owne hand,  
> Do backe rebut, and each to other yeeldeth land.
>
> As when two rams stird with ambitious pride,  
>     Fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flocke,  
>     Their horned fronts so fierce on either side  
>     Do meete, that with the terrour of the shocke  
>     Astonied both, stand sencelesse as a blocke,  
>     Forgetfull of the hanging victory:  
>     So stood these twaine, vnmoued as a rocke,  
>     Both staring fierce, and holding idely  
> The broken reliques of their former cruelty.
>
> The *Sarazin* sore daunted with the buffe  
>     Snatcheth his sword, and fiercely to him flies;  
>     Who well it wards, and quyteth cuff with cuff:  
>     Each others equall puissaunce enuies,  
>     And through their iron sides with cruell spies  
>     Does seeke to perce: repining courage yields  
>     No foote to foe. The flashing fier flies  
>     As from a forge out of their burning shields,  
> And streames of purple bloud new dies the verdant fields.
>
> Curse on that Crosse (quoth then the *Sarazin*)  
>     That keepes thy body from the bitter fit;  
>     Dead long ygoe I wote thou haddest bin,  
>     Had not that charme from thee forwarned it:  
>     But yet I warne thee now assured sitt,  
>     And hide thy head. Therewith vpon his crest  
>     With rigour so outrageous he smitt,  
>     That a large share it hewd out of the rest,  
> And glauncing downe his shield, from blame him fairely blest.
>
> Who thereat wondrous wroth, the sleeping spark  
>     Of natiue vertue gan eftsoones reuiue,  
>     And at his haughtie helmet making mark,  
>     So hugely stroke, that it the steele did riue,  
>     And cleft his head. He tumbling downe aliue,  
>     With bloudy mouth his mother earth did kis,  
>     Greeting his graue: his grudging ghost did striue  
>     With the fraile flesh; at last it flitted is,  
> Whither the soules do fly of men, that liue amis.
>
> The Lady when she saw her champion fall,  
>     Like the old ruines of a broken towre,  
>     Staid not to waile his woefull funerall,  
>     But from him fled away with all her powre;  
>     Who after her as hastily gan scowre,  
>     Bidding the Dwarfe with him to bring away  
>     The *Sarazins* shield, signe of the conqueroure.  
>     Her soone he ouertooke, and bad to stay,  
> For present cause was none of dread her to dismay.
>
> She turning backe with ruefull countenaunce,  
>     Cride, Mercy mercy Sir vouchsafe to show  
>     On silly Dame, subiect to hard mischaunce,  
>     And to your mighty will. Her humblesse low  
>     In so ritch weedes and seeming glorious show,  
>     Did much emmoue his stout hero¨icke heart,  
>     And said, Deare dame, your suddein ouerthrow  
>     Much rueth me; but now put feare apart,  
> And tell, both who ye be, and who that tooke your part.
>
> Melting in teares, then gan she thus lament;  
>     The wretched woman, whom vnhappy howre  
>     Hath now made thrall to your commandement,  
>     Before that angry heauens list to lowre,  
>     And fortune false betraide me to your powre,  
>     Was, (O what now auaileth that I was!)  
>     Borne the sole daughter of an Emperour,  
>     He that the wide West vnder his rule has,  
> And high hath set his throne, where *Tiberis* doth pas.
>
> He in the first flowre of my freshest age,  
>     Betrothed me vnto the onely haire  
>     Of a most mighty king, most rich and sage;  
>     Was neuer Prince so faithfull and so faire,  
>     Was neuer Prince so meeke and debonaire;  
>     But ere my hoped day of spousall shone,  
>     My dearest Lord fell from high honours staire,  
>     Into the hands of his accursed fone,  
> And cruelly was slaine, that shall I euer mone.
>
> His blessed body spoild of liuely breath,  
>     Was afterward, I know not how, conuaid  
>     And fro me hid: of whose most innocent death  
>     When tidings came to me vnhappy maid,  
>     O how great sorrow my sad soule assaid.  
>     Then forth I went his woefull corse to find,  
>     And many yeares throughout the world I straid,  
>     A virgin widow, whose deepe wounded mind  
> With loue, long time did languish as the striken hind.
>
> At last it chaunced this proud *Sarazin*  
>     To meete me wandring, who perforce me led  
>     With him away, but yet could neuer win  
>     The Fort, that Ladies hold in soueraigne dread.  
>     There lies he now with foule dishonour dead,  
>     Who whiles he liu'de, was called proud *Sans foy*,  
>     The eldest of three brethren, all three bred  
>     Of one bad sire, whose youngest is *Sans ioy*,  
> And twixt them both was borne the bloudy bold *Sans loy*.
>
> In this sad plight, friendlesse, vnfortunate,  
>     Now miserable I *Fidessa* dwell,  
>     Crauing of you in pitty of my state,  
>     To do none ill, if please ye not do well.  
>     He in great passion all this while did dwell,  
>     More busying his quicke eyes, her face to view,  
>     Then his dull eares, to heare what she did tell;  
>     And said, Faire Lady hart of flint would rew  
> The vndeserued woes and sorrowes, which ye shew.
>
> Henceforth in safe assuraunce may ye rest,  
>     Hauing both found a new friend you to aid,  
>     And lost an old foe, that did you molest:  
>     Better new friend then an old foe is said.  
>     With chaunge of cheare the seeming simple maid  
>     Let fall her eyen, as shamefast to the earth,  
>     And yeelding soft, in that she nought gain-said,  
>     So forth they rode, he feining seemely merth,  
> And she coy lookes: so dainty they say maketh derth.
>
> Long time they thus together traueiled,  
>     Till weary of their way, they came at last,  
>     Where grew two goodly trees, that faire did spred  
>     Their armes abroad, with gray mosse ouercast,  
>     And their greene leaues trembling with euery blast,  
>     Made a calme shadow far in compasse round:  
>     The fearefull Shepheard often there aghast  
>     Vnder them neuer sat, ne wont there sound  
> His mery oaten pipe, but shund th'vnlucky ground.
>
> But this good knight soone as he them can spie,  
>     For the coole shade him thither hastly got:  
>     For golden *Phoebus* now ymounted hie,  
>     From fiery wheeles of his faire chariot  
>     Hurled his beame so scorching cruell hot,  
>     That liuing creature mote it not abide;  
>     And his new Lady it endured not.  
>     There they alight, in hope themselues to hide  
> From the fierce heat, and rest their weary limbs a tide.
>
> Faire seemely pleasaunce each to other makes,  
>     With goodly purposes there as they sit:  
>     And in his falsed fancy he her takes  
>     To be the fairest wight, that liued yit;  
>     Which to expresse, he bends his gentle wit,  
>     And thinking of those braunches greene to frame  
>     A girlond for her dainty forehead fit,  
>     He pluckt a bough; out of whose rift there came  
> Small drops of gory bloud, that trickled downe the same.
>
> Therewith a piteous yelling voyce was heard,  
>     Crying, O spare with guilty hands to teare  
>     My tender sides in this rough rynd embard,  
>     But fly, ah fly far hence away, for feare  
>     Least to you hap, that happened to me heare,  
>     And to this wretched Lady, my deare loue,  
>     O too deare loue, loue bought with death too deare.  
>     Astond he stood, and vp his haire did houe,  
> And with that suddein horror could no member moue.
>
> At last whenas the dreadfull passion  
>     Was ouerpast, and manhood well awake,  
>     Yet musing at the straunge occasion,  
>     And doubting much his sence, he thus bespake;  
>     What voyce of damned Ghost from *Limbo* lake,  
>     Or guilefull spright wandring in empty aire,  
>     Both which fraile men do oftentimes mistake,  
>     Sends to my doubtfull eares these speaches rare,  
> And ruefull plaints, me bidding guiltlesse bloud to spare?
>
> Then groning deepe, Nor damned Ghost, (quoth he,)  
>     Nor guilefull sprite, to thee these wordes doth speake,  
>     But once a man *Fradubio*, now a tree,  
>     Wretched man, wretched tree; whose nature weake,  
>     A cruell witch her cursed will to wreake,  
>     Hath thus transformd, and plast in open plaines,  
>     Where *Boreas* doth blow full bitter bleake,  
>     And scorching Sunne does dry my secret vaines:  
> For though a tree I seeme, yet cold and heat me paines.
>
> Say on *Fradubio* then, or man, or tree,  
>     Quoth then the knight, by whose mischieuous arts  
>     Art thou misshaped thus, as now I see?  
>     He oft finds med'cine, who his griefe imparts;  
>     But double griefs afflict concealing harts,  
>     As raging flames who striueth to suppresse.  
>     The author then (said he) of all my smarts,  
>     Is one *Duessa* a false sorceresse,  
> That many errãt knights hath brought to wretchednesse.
>
> In prime of youthly yeares, when corage hot  
>     The fire of loue and ioy of cheualree  
>     First kindled in my brest, it was my lot  
>     To loue this gentle Lady, whom ye see,  
>     Now not a Lady, but a seeming tree;  
>     With whom as once I rode accompanyde,  
>     Me chaunced of a knight encountred bee,  
>     That had a like faire Lady by his syde,  
> Like a faire Lady, but did fowle *Duessa* hyde.
>
> Whose forged beauty he did take in hand,  
>     All other Dames to haue exceeded farre;  
>     I in defence of mine did likewise stand,  
>     Mine, that did then shine as the Morning starre:  
>     So both to battell fierce arraunged arre,  
>     In which his harder fortune was to fall  
>     Vnder my speare: such is the dye of warre:  
>     His Lady left as a prise martiall,  
> Did yield her comely person, to be at my call.
>
> So doubly lou'd of Ladies vnlike faire,  
>     Th'one seeming such, the other such indeede,  
>     One day in doubt I cast for to compare,  
>     Whether in beauties glorie did exceede;  
>     A Rosy girlond was the victors meede:  
>     Both seemde to win, and both seemde won to bee,  
>     So hard the discord was to be agreede.  
>     *Frælissa* was as faire, as faire mote bee,  
> And euer false *Duessa* seemde as faire as shee.
>
> The wicked witch now seeing all this while  
>     The doubtfull ballaunce equally to sway,  
>     What not by right, she cast to win by guile,  
>     And by her hellish science raisd streightway  
>     A foggy mist, that ouercast the day,  
>     And a dull blast, that breathing on her face,  
>     Dimmed her former beauties shining ray,  
>     And with foule vgly forme did her disgrace:  
> Then was she faire alone, when none was faire in place.
>
> Then cride she out, Fye, fye, deformed wight,  
>     Whose borrowed beautie now appeareth plaine  
>     To haue before bewitched all mens sight;  
>     O leaue her soone, or let her soone be slaine.  
>     Her loathly visage viewing with disdaine,  
>     Eftsoones I thought her such, as she me told,  
>     And would haue kild her; but with faigned paine,  
>     The false witch did my wrathfull hand with-hold;  
> So left her, where she now is turnd to treen mould.
>
> Thensforth I tooke *Duessa* for my Dame,  
>     And in the witch vnweeting ioyd long time,  
>     Ne euer wist, but that she was the same,  
>     Till on a day (that day is euery Prime,  
>     When Witches wont do penance for their crime)  
>     I chaunst to see her in her proper hew,  
>     Bathing her selfe in origane and thyme:  
>     A filthy foule old woman I did vew,  
> That euer to haue toucht her, I did deadly rew.
>
> Her neather partes misshapen, monstruous,  
>     Were hidd in water, that I could not see,  
>     But they did seeme more foule and hideous,  
>     Then womans shape man would beleeue to bee.  
>     Thensforth from her most beastly companie  
>     I gan refraine, in minde to slip away,  
>     Soone as appeard safe opportunitie:  
>     For danger great, if not assur'd decay  
> I saw before mine eyes, if I were knowne to stray.
>
> The diuelish hag by chaunges of my cheare  
>     Perceiu'd my thought, and drownd in sleepie night,  
>     With wicked herbes and ointments did besmeare  
>     My bodie all, through charmes and magicke might,  
>     That all my senses were bereaued quight:  
>     Then brought she me into this desert waste,  
>     And by my wretched louers side me pight,  
>     Where now enclosd in wooden wals full faste,  
> Banisht from liuing wights, our wearie dayes we waste.
>
> But how long time, said then the Elfin knight,  
>     Are you in this misformed house to dwell?  
>     We may not chaunge (quoth he) this euil plight,  
>     Till we be bathed in a liuing well;  
>     That is the terme prescribed by the spell.  
>     O how, said he, mote I that well out find,  
>     That may restore you to your wonted well?  
>     Time and suffised fates to former kynd  
> Shall vs restore, none else from hence may vs vnbynd.
>
> The false *Duessa*, now *Fidessa* hight,  
>     Heard how in vaine *Fradubio* did lament,  
>     And knew well all was true. But the good knight  
>     Full of sad feare and ghastly dreriment,  
>     When all this speech the liuing tree had spent,  
>     The bleeding bough did thrust into the ground,  
>     That from the bloud he might be innocent,  
>     And with fresh clay did close the wooden wound:  
> Then turning to his Lady, dead with feare her found.
>
> Her seeming dead he found with feigned feare,  
>     As all vnweeting of that well she knew,  
>     And paynd himselfe with busie care to reare  
>     Her out of carelesse swowne. Her eylids blew  
>     And dimmed sight with pale and deadly hew  
>     At last she vp gan lift: with trembling cheare  
>     Her vp he tooke, too simple and too trew,  
> And oft her kist. At length all passed feare,  
> He set her on her steede, and forward forth did beare.
