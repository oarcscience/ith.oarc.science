VII. </i></center><p> 

<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>Pealing, from</i> Ioue, <i>to</i> Natur's <i>Bar,</i><br>
<i>bold </i>Alteration<i> pleades<br>
Large Euidence: but </i>Nature<i> soone<br>
her righteous Doome arades.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
A
H! whither doost thou now thou greater Muse<br>
Me from these woods &amp; pleasing forrests bring?<br>
And my fraile spirit (that dooth oft refuse<br>
This too high flight, vnfit for her weake wing)<br>
Lift vp aloft, to tell of heauens King<br>
(Thy soueraine Sire) his fortunate successe,<br>
And victory, in bigger noates to sing,<br>
Which he obtain'd against that <i>Titanesse</i>,<br>
That him of heauens Empire sought to dispossesse.<p>

Yet sith I needs must follow thy behest,<br>
Doe thou my weaker wit with skill inspire,<br>
Fit for this turne ; and in my sable brest<br>
Kindle fresh sparks of that immortall fire,<br>
Which learned minds inflameth with desire<br>
Of heauenly things: for, who but thou alone,<br>
That art yborne of heauen and heauenly Sire,<br>
Can tell things doen in heauen so long ygone:<br>
So farre past memory of man that may be knowne.<p>

Now, at the time that was before agreed,<br>
The Gods assembled all on <i>Arlo</i> hill;<br>
As well those that are sprung of heauenly seed,<br>
As those that all the other world doe fill,<br>
And rule both sea and land vnto their will:<br>
Onely th'infernall Powers might not appeare;<br>
Aswell for horror of their count'naunce ill,<br>
As for th'vnruly fiends which they did feare;<br>
Yet <i>Pluto</i> and <i>Proserpina</i> were present there.<p>

And thither also came all other creatures,<br>
What-euer life or motion doe retaine,<br>
According to their sundry kinds of features;<br>
That <i>Arlo</i> scarsly could them all containe;<br>
So full they filled euery hill and Plaine:<br>
And had not <i>Natures</i> Sergeant (that is <i>Order</i>)<br>
Them well disposed by his busie paine,<br>
And raunged farre abroad in euery border,<br>
They would haue caused much confusion and disorder.<p>

Then forth issewed (great goddesse) great dame <i>Nature</i>,<br>
With goodly port and gracious Maiesty;<br>
Being far greater and more tall of stature<br>
Then any of the gods or Powers on hie:<br>
Yet certes by her face and physnomy,<br>
Whether she man or woman inly were,<br>
That could not any creature well descry:<br>
For, with a veile that wimpled euery where,<br>
Her head and face was hid, that mote to none appeare<p>

That some doe say was so by skill deuized,<br>
To hide the terror of her vncouth hew,<br>
From mortall eyes that should be sore agrized;<br>
For that her face did like a Lion shew,<br>
That eye of wight could not indure to view:<br>
But others tell that it so beautious was,<br>
And round about such beames of splendor threw,<br>
That it the Sunne a thousand times did pass,<br>
Ne could be seene, but like an image in a glass.<p>

That well may seemen true: for, well I weene<br>
That this same day, when she on <i>Arlo</i> sat,<br>
Her garment was so bright and wondrous sheene,<br>
That my fraile wit cannot deuize to what<br>
It to compare, nor finde like stuffe to that,<br>
As those three sacred <i>Saints</i>, though else most wise,<br>
Yet on mount <i>Thabor</i> quite their wits forgat,<br>
When they their glorious Lord in strange disguise<br>
Transfigur'd sawe; his garments so did daze their eyes.<p>

In a fayre Plaine vpon an equall Hill,<br>
She placed was in a pauilion;<br>
Not such as Craftes-men by their idle skill<br>
Are wont for Princes states to fashion:<br>
But th'earth her self of her owne motion,<br>
Out of her fruitfull bosome made to growe<br>
Most dainty trees; that, shooting vp anon,<br>
Did seeme to bow their bloosming heads full lowe,<br>
For homage vnto her, and like a throne did shew.<p>

So hard it is for any liuing wight,<br>
All her array and vestiments to tell,<br>
That old <i>Dan Geffrey</i> (in whose gentle spright<br>
The pure well head of Poesie did dwell)<br>
In his <i>Foules parley</i> durst not with it mel,<br>
But it transferd to <i>Alane</i>, who he thought<br>
Had in his <i>Plaint of kindes</i> describ'd it well:<br>
Which who will read set forth so as it ought,<br>
Go seek he out that <i>Alane</i> where he may be sought.<p>

And all the earth far vnderneath her feete<br>
Was dight with flowres, that voluntary grew<br>
Out of the ground, and sent forth odours sweet;<br>
Tenne thousand mores of sundry sent and hew,<br>
That might delight the smell, or please the view:<br>
The which, the Nymphes, from all the brooks thereby<br>
Had gathered, which they at her foot-stoole threw;<br>
That richer seem'd then any tapestry,<br>
That Princes bowres adorne with painted imagery.<p>

And <i>Mole</i> himselfe, to honour her the more,<br>
Did deck himself in freshest faire attire,<br>
And his high head, that seemeth alwaies hore<br>
With hardned frosts of former winters ire,<br>
He with an Oaken girlond now did tire,<br>
As if the loue of some new Nymph late seene,<br>
Had in him kindled youthfull fresh desire,<br>
And made him change his gray attire to greene;<br>
Ah gentle <i>Mole</i>! such ioyance hath thee well beseene.<p>

Was neuer so great ioyance since the day,<br>
That all the gods whylome assembled were,<br>
On <i>H&aelig;mus</i> hill in their diuine array,<br>
To celebrate the solemne bridall cheare,<br>
Twixt <i>Peleus</i>, and dame <i>Thetis</i> pointed there;<br>
Where <i>Phoebus</i> self, that god of Poets hight,<br>
They say did sing the spousall hymne full cleere,<br>
That all the gods were rauisht with delight<br>
Of his celestiall song, &amp; Musicks wondrous might.<p>

This great Grandmother of all creatures bred<br>
Great <i>Nature</i>, euer young yet full of eld,<br>
Still moouing, yet vnmoued from her sted;<br>
Vnseene of any, yet of all beheld;<br>
Thus sitting in her throne as I haue teld,<br>
Before her came dame <i>Mutabilitie</i>;<br>
And being lowe before her presence feld,<br>
With meek obaysance and humilitie,<br>
Thus gan her plaintif Plea, with words to amplifie;<p>

To thee &ocirc; greatest goddesse, onely great,<br>
An humble suppliant loe, I lowely fly<br>
Seeking for Right, which I of thee entreat;<br>
Who Right to all dost deale indifferently,<br>
Damning all Wrong and tortious Iniurie,<br>
Which any of thy creatures doe to other<br>
(Oppressing them with power, vnequally)<br>
Sith of them all thou art the equall mother,<br>
And knittest each to each, as brother vnto brother.<p>

To thee therefore of this same <i>Ioue</i> I plaine,<br>
And of his fellow gods that faine to be,<br>
That challenge to themselues the whole worlds raign;<br>
Of which, the greatest part is due to me,<br>
And heauen it selfe by heritage in Fee:<br>
For, heauen and earth I both alike do deeme,<br>
Sith heauen and earth are both alike to thee;<br>
And, gods no more then men thou doest esteeme:<br>
For, euen the gods to thee, as men to gods do seeme.<p>

Then weigh, &ocirc; soueraigne goddesse, by what right<br>
These gods do claime the worlds whole souerainty;<br>
And that is onely dew vnto thy might<br>
Arrogate to themselues ambitiously:<br>
As for the gods owne principality,<br>
Which <i>Ioue</i> vsurpes vniustly; that to be<br>
My heritage, <i>Ioue's</i> self cannot deny,<br>
From my great Grandsire <i>Titan</i>, vnto mee,<br>
Deriv'd by dew descent; as is well knowen to thee.<p>

Yet mauger <i>Ioue</i>, and all his gods beside,<br>
I doe possesse the worlds most regiment;<br>
As, if ye please it into parts diuide,<br>
And euery parts inholders to conuent,<br>
Shall to your eyes appeare incontinent.<br>
And first, the Earth (great mother of vs all)<br>
That only seems vnmov'd and permanent,<br>
And vnto <i>Mutability</i> not thrall;<br>
Yet is she chang'd in part, and eeke in generall.<p>

For, all that from her springs, and is ybredde,<br>
How-euer fayre it flourish for a time,<br>
Yet see we soone decay; and, being dead<br>
To turne again vnto their earthly slime:<br>
Yet, out of their decay and mortall crime,<br>
We daily see new creatures to arize;<br>
And of their Winter spring another Prime,<br>
Vnlike in forme, and chang'd by strange disguise:<br>
So turne they still about, and change in restlesse wise.<p>

As for her tenants; that is, man and beasts,<br>
The beasts we daily see massacred dy,<br>
As thralls and vassalls vnto mens beheasts:<br>
And men themselues doe change continually,<br>
From youth to eld, from wealth to pouerty,<br>
From good to bad, from bad to worst of all.<br>
Ne doe their bodies only flit and fly:<br>
But eeke their minds (which they immortall call)<br>
Still change and vary thoughts, as new occasions fall.<p>

Ne is the water in more constant case;<br>
Whether those same on high, or these belowe.<br>
For, th'Ocean moueth stil, from place to place;<br>
And euery Riuer still doth ebbe and flowe:<br>
Ne any Lake, that seems most still and slowe,<br>
Ne Poole so small, that can his smoothnesse holde,<br>
When any winde doth vnder heauen blowe;<br>
With which, the clouds are also tost and roll'd;<br>
Now like great Hills; &amp;, streight, like sluces, them vnfold.<p>

So likewise are all watry liuing wights<br>
Still tost, and turned, with continuall change<br>
Neuer abyding in their stedfast plights.<br>
The fish, still floting, doe at randon range,<br>
And neuer rest; but euermore exchange<br>
Their dwelling places, as the streames them carrie:<br>
Ne haue the watry foules a certaine grange,<br>
Wherein to rest, ne in one stead do tarry;<br>
But flitting still doe flie, and still their places vary.<p>

Next is the Ayre: which who feeles not by sense<br>
(For, of all sense it is the middle meane)<br>
To flit still? and, with subtill influence<br>
Of his thin spirit, all creatures to maintaine,<br>
In state of life?  O weake life! that does leane<br>
On thing so tickle as th'vnsteady ayre;<br>
Which euery howre is chang'd, and altred cleane<br>
With euery blast that bloweth fowle or faire:<br>
The faire doth it prolong; the fowle doth it impaire.<p>

Therein the changes infinite beholde,<br>
Which to her creatures euery minute chaunce;<br>
Now, boyling hot: streight, friezing deadly cold:<br>
Now, faire sun-shine, that makes all skip and daunce:<br>
Streight, bitter storms and balefull countenance,<br>
That makes them all to shiuer and to shake:<br>
Rayne, hayle, and snowe do pay them sad penance,<br>
And dreadfull thunder-claps (that make them quake)<br>
With flames &amp; flashing lights that thousand changes make.<p>

Last is the fire: which, though it liue for euer,<br>
Ne can be quenched quite; yet, euery day,<br>
Wee see his parts, so soone as they do seuer,<br>
To lose their heat, and shortly to decay;<br>
So, makes himself his owne consuming pray.<br>
Ne any liuing creatures doth he breed:<br>
But all, that are of others bredd, doth slay;<br>
And, with their death, his cruell life dooth feed;<br>
Nought leauing, but their barren ashes, without seede.<p>

Thus, all these fower (the which the ground-work bee<br>
Of all the world, and of all liuing wights)<br>
To thousand sorts of <i>Change</i> we subiect see:<br>
Yet are they chang'd (by other wondrous slights)<br>
Into themselues, and lose their natiue mights;<br>
The Fire to Aire, and th'Ayre to Water sheere,<br>
And Water into Earth : yet Water fights<br>
With Fire, and Aire with Earth approaching neere:<br>
Yet all are in one body, and as one appeare.<p>

So, in them all raignes <i>Mutabilitie</i>;<br>
How-euer these, that Gods themselues do call,<br>
Of them doe claime the rule and souerainty:<br>
As, <i>Vesta</i>, of the fire &aelig;thereall;<br>
<i>Vulcan</i>, of this, with vs so vsuall;<br>
<i>Ops</i>, of the earth; and <i>Iuno</i> of the Ayre;<br>
<i>Neptune</i>, of Seas; and Nymphes, of Riuers all.<br>
For, all those Riuers to me subiect are:<br>
And all the rest, which they vsurp, be all my share.<p>

Which to approuen true, as I haue told,<br>
Vouchsafe, &ocirc; goddesse, to thy presence call<br>
The rest which doe the world in being hold:<br>
As, times and seasons of the yeare that fall:<br>
Of all the which, demand in generall,<br>
Or iudge thy selfe, by verdit of thine eye,<br>
Whether to me they are not subiect all.<br>
<i>Nature</i> did yeeld thereto; and by-and-by,<br>
Bade <i>Order</i> call them all, before her Maiesty.<p>

So, forth issew'd the Seasons of the yeare;<br>
First, lusty <i>Spring</i>, all dight in leaues of flowres<br>
That freshly budded and new bloosmes did beare<br>
(In which a thousand birds had built their bowres<br>
That sweetly sung, to call forth Paramours):<br>
And in his hand a iauelin he did beare,<br>
And on his head (as fit for warlike stoures)<br>
A guilt engrauen morion he did weare;<br>
That as some did him loue, so others did him feare.<p>

Then came the iolly <i>Sommer</i>, being dight<br>
In a thin silken cassock coloured greene,<br>
That was vnlyned all, to be more light:<br>
And on his head a girlond well beseene<br>
He wore, from which as he had chauffed been<br>
The sweat did drop; and in his hand he bore<br>
A boawe and shaftes, as he in forrest greene<br>
Had hunted late the Libbard or the Bore,<br>
And now would bathe his limbes, with labor heated sore.<p>

Then came the <i>Autumne</i> all in yellow clad,<br>
As though he ioyed in his plentious store,<br>
Laden with fruits that made him laugh, full glad<br>
That he had banisht hunger, which to-fore<br>
Had by the belly oft him pinched sore.<br>
Vpon his head a wreath that was enrold<br>
With eares of corne, of euery sort he bore:<br>
And in his hand a sickle he did holde,<br>
To reape the ripened fruits the which the earth had yold.<p>

Lastly, came <i>Winter</i> cloathed all in frize,<br>
Chattering his teeth for cold that did him chill,<br>
Whil'st on his hoary beard his breath did freese;<br>
And the dull drops that from his purpled bill<br>
As from a limbeck did adown distill.<br>
In his right hand a tipped staffe he held,<br>
With which his feeble steps he stayed still:<br>
For, he was faint with cold, and weak with eld;<br>
That scarse his loosed limbes he hable was to weld.<p>

These, marching softly, thus in order went,<br>
And after them, the Monthes all riding came;<br>
First, sturdy <i>March</i> with brows full sternly bent,<br>
And armed strongly, rode vpon a Ram,<br>
The same which ouer <i>Hellespontus</i> swam:<br>
Yet in his hand a spade he also hent,<br>
And in a bag all sorts of seeds ysame,<br>
Which on the earth he strowed as he went,<br>
And fild her womb with fruitfull hope of nourishment.<p>

Next came fresh <i>Aprill</i> full of lustyhed,<br>
And wanton as a Kid whose horne new buds:<br>
Vpon a Bull he rode, the same which led<br>
<i>Europa</i> floting through th'<i>Argolick</i> fluds:<br>
His hornes were gilden all with golden studs<br>
And garnished with garlonds goodly dight<br>
Of all the fairest flowres and freshest buds<br>
Which th'earth brings forth, and wet he seem'd in sight<br>
With waues, through which he waded for his loues delight.<p>

Then came faire <i>May</i>, the fayrest mayd on ground,<br>
Deckt all with dainties of her seasons pryde,<br>
And throwing flowres out of her lap around:<br>
Vpon two brethrens shoulders she did ride,<br>
The twinnes of <i>Leda</i>; which on eyther side<br>
Supported her like to their soueraine Queene.<br>
Lord! how all creatures laught, when her they spide,<br>
And leapt and daunc't as they had rauisht beene!<br>
And <i>Cupid</i> selfe about her fluttred all in greene.<p>

And after her, came iolly <i>Iune</i>, arrayd<br>
All in greene leaues, as he a Player were;<br>
Yet in his time, he wrought as well as playd,<br>
That by his plough-yrons mote right well appeare:<br>
Vpon a Crab he rode, that him did beare<br>
With crooked crawling steps an vncouth pase,<br>
And backward yode, as Bargemen wont to fare<br>
Bending their force contrary to their face,<br>
Like that vngracious crew which faines demurest grace.<p>

Then came hot <i>Iuly</i> boyling like to fire,<br>
That all his garments he had cast away:<br>
Vpon a Lyon raging yet with ire<br>
He boldly rode and made him to obay:<br>
It was the beast that whylome did forray<br>
The Nemaean forrest, till th'<i>Amphytrionide</i><br>
Him slew, and with his hide did him array;<br>
Behinde his back a sithe, and by his side<br>
Vnder his belt he bore a sickle circling wide.<p>

The sixt was <i>August</i>, being rich arrayd<br>
In garment all of gold downe to the ground:<br>
Yet rode he not, but led a louely Mayd<br>
Forth by the lilly hand, the which was cround<br>
With eares of corne, and full her hand was found;<br>
That was the righteous Virgin, which of old<br>
Liv'd here on earth, and plenty made abound;<br>
But, after Wrong was lov'd and Iustice solde,<br>
She left th'vnrighteous world and was to heauen extold.<p>

Next him, <i>September</i> marched eeke on foote;<br>
Yet was he heauy laden with the spoyle<br>
Of haruests riches, which he made his boot,<br>
And him enricht with bounty of the soyle:<br>
In his one hand, as fit for haruests toyle,<br>
He held a knife-hook; and in th'other hand<br>
A paire of waights, with which he did assoyle<br>
Both more and lesse, where it in doubt did stand,<br>
And equall gaue to each as Iustice duly scann'd.<p>

Then came <i>October</i> full of merry glee:<br>
For, yet his noule was totty of the must,<br>
Which he was treading in the wine-fats see,<br>
And of the ioyous oyle, whose gentle gust<br>
Made him so frollick and so full of lust:<br>
Vpon a dreadfull Scorpion he did ride,<br>
The same which by <i>Dianaes</i> doom vniust<br>
Slew great <i>Orion:</i> and eeke by his side<br>
He had his ploughing share, and coulter ready tyde.<p>

Next was <i>Nouember</i>, he full grosse and fat,<br>
As fed with lard, and that right well might seeme;<br>
For, he had been a fatting hogs of late,<br>
That yet his browes with sweat, did reek and steem,<br>
And yet the season was full sharp and breem;<br>
In planting eeke he took no small delight:<br>
Whereon he rode, not easie was to deeme;<br>
For it a dreadfull <i>Centaure</i> was in sight,<br>
The seed of <i>Saturne</i>, and faire <i>Nais, Chiron</i> hight,<p>

And after him, came next the chill <i>December:</i><br>
Yet he through merry feasting which he made,<br>
And great bonfires, did not the cold remember;<br>
His Sauiours birth his mind so much did glad:<br>
Vpon a shaggy-bearded Goat he rode,<br>
The same wherewith <i>Dan Ioue</i> in tender yeares,<br>
They say, was nourisht by th'<i>I[d]oean</i> mayd;<br>
And in his hand a broad deepe boawle he beares;<br>
Of which, he freely drinks an health to all his peeres.<p>

Then came old <i>Ianuary</i>, wrapped well<br>
In many weeds to keep the cold away;<br>
Yet did he quake and quiuer like to quell,<br>
And blowe his nayles to warme them if he may:<br>
For, they were numbd with holding all the day<br>
An hatchet keene, with which he felled wood,<br>
And from the trees did lop the needlesse spray:<br>
Vpon an huge great Earth-pot steane he stood;<br>
From whose wide mouth, there flowed forth the Romane floud.<p>

And lastly, came cold <i>February</i>, sitting<br>
In an old wagon, for he could not ride;<br>
Drawne of two fishes for the season fitting,<br>
Which through the flood before did softly slyde<br>
And swim away: yet had he by his side<br>
His plough and harnesse fit to till the ground,<br>
And tooles to prune the trees, before the pride<br>
Of hasting Prime did make them burgein round:<br>
So past the twelue Months forth, &amp; their dew places found.<p>

And after these, there came the <i>Day</i>, and <i>Night</i>,<br>
Riding together both with equall pace,<br>
Th'one on a Palfrey blacke, the other white;<br>
But <i>Night</i> had couered her vncomely face<br>
With a blacke veile, and held in hand a mace,<br>
On top whereof the moon and stars were pight,<br>
And sleep and darknesse round about did trace:<br>
But <i>Day</i> did beare, vpon his scepters hight,<br>
The goodly Sun, encompast all with beames bright.<p>

Then came the <i>Howres</i>, faire daughters of high <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
And timely <i>Night</i>, the which were all endewed<br>
With wondrous beauty fit to kindle loue;<br>
But they were Virgins all, and loue eschewed,<br>
That might forslack the charge to them fore-shewed<br>
By mighty <i>Ioue</i>; who did them Porters make<br>
Of heauens gate (whence all the gods issued)<br>
Which they did dayly watch, and nightly wake<br>
By euen turnes, ne euer did their charge forsake.<p>

And after all came <i>Life</i>, and lastly <i>Death</i>;<br>
<i>Death</i> with most grim and griesly visage seene,<br>
Yet is he nought but parting of the breath;<br>
Ne ought to see, but like a shade to weene,<br>
Vnbodied, vnsoul'd, vnheard, vnseene.<br>
But <i>Life</i> was like a faire young lusty boy,<br>
Such as they faine <i>Dan Cupid</i> to haue beene,<br>
Full of delightfull health and liuely ioy.<br>
Deckt all with flowres, and wings of gold fit to employ.<p>

When these were past, thus gan the <i>Titanesse</i>;<br>
Lo, mighty mother, now be iudge and say,<br>
Whether in all thy creatures more or lesse<br>
<i>CHANGE</i> doth not raign &amp; beare the greatest sway:<br>
For, who sees not, that <i>Time</i> on all doth pray?<br>
But <i>Times</i> do change and moue continually.<br>
So nothing here long standeth in one stay:<br>
Wherefore, this lower world who can deny<br>
But to be subiect still to <i>Mutabilitie?</i><p>

Then thus gan <i>Ioue</i>; Right true it is, that these<br>
And all things else that vnder heauen dwell<br>
Are chaung'd of <i>Time</i>, who doth them all disseise<br>
Of being : But, who is it (to me tell)<br>
That <i>Time</i> himselfe doth moue and still compell<br>
To keepe his course?  Is not that namely wee<br>
Which poure that vertue from our heauenly cell,<br>
That moues them all, and makes them changed be?<br>
So them we gods doe rule, and in them also thee.<p>

To whom, thus <i>Mutability</i>: The things<br>
Which we see not how they are mov'd and swayd,<br>
Ye may attribute to your selues as Kings,<br>
And say they by your secret powre are made:<br>
But what we see not, who shall vs perswade?<br>
But were they so, as ye them faine to be,<br>
Mov'd by your might, and ordred by your ayde;<br>
Yet what if I can proue, that euen yee<br>
Your selues are likewise chang'd, and subiect vnto mee?<p>

And first, concerning her that is the first,<br>
Euen you faire <i>Cynthia</i>, whom so much ye make<br>
<i>Ioues</i> dearest darling, she was bred and nurst<br>
On <i>Cynthus</i> hill, whence she her name did take:<br>
Then is she mortall borne, how-so ye crake;<br>
Besides, her face and countenance euery day<br>
We changed see, and sundry forms partake,<br>
Now hornd, now ro&utild;d, now bright, now brown &amp; gray:<br>
So that <i>as changefull as the Moone</i> men vse to say.<p>

Next, <i>Mercury</i>, who though he lesse appeare<br>
To change his hew, and alwayes seeme as one;<br>
Yet, he his course doth altar euery yeare,<br>
And is of late far out of order gone:<br>
So <i>Venus</i> eeke, that goodly Paragone,<br>
Though faire all night, yet is she darke all day;<br>
And <i>Phoebus</i> self, who lightsome is alone,<br>
Yet is he oft eclipsed by the way,<br>
And fills the darkned world with terror and dismay.<p>

Now <i>Mars</i> that valiant man is changed most:<br>
For, he some times so far runs out of square,<br>
That he his way doth seem quite to haue lost,<br>
And cleane without his vsuall sphere to fare;<br>
That euen these Star-gazers stonisht are<br>
At sight thereof, and damne their lying bookes:<br>
So likewise, grim Sir <i>Saturne</i> oft doth spare<br>
His sterne aspect, and calme his crabbed lookes:<br>
So many turning cranks these haue, so many crookes.<p>

But you <i>Dan Ioue</i>, that only constant are,<br>
And King of all the rest, as ye do clame,<br>
Are you not subiect eeke to this misfare?<br>
Then let me aske you this withouten blame,<br>
Where were ye borne? some say in <i>Crete</i> by name,<br>
Others in <i>Thebes</i>, and others other-where;<br>
But wheresoeuer they comment the same,<br>
They all consent that ye begotten were,<br>
And borne here in this world, ne other can appeare.<p>

Then are ye mortall borne, and thrall to me,<br>
Vnlesse the kingdome of the sky yee make<br>
Immortall, and vnchangeable to bee;<br>
Besides, that power and vertue which ye spake,<br>
That ye here worke, doth many changes take,<br>
And your owne natures change: for, each of you<br>
That vertue haue, or this, or that to make,<br>
Is checkt and changed from his nature trew,<br>
By others opposition or obliquid view.<p>

Besides, the sundry motions of your Spheares,<br>
So sundry waies and fashions as clerkes faine,<br>
Some in short space, and some in longer yeares;<br>
What is the same but alteration plaine?<br>
Onely the starrie skie doth still remaine:<br>
Yet do the Starres and Signes therein still moue,<br>
And euen it self is mov'd, as wizards saine.<br>
But all that moueth, doth mutation loue:<br>
Therefore both you and them to me I subiect proue.<p>

Then since within this wide great <i>Vniuerse</i><br>
Nothing doth firme and permanent appeare,<br>
But all things tost and turned by transuerse:<br>
What then should let, but I aloft should reare<br>
My Trophee, and from all, the triumph beare?<br>
Now iudge then (O thou greatest goddesse trew!)<br>
According as thy selfe doest see and heare,<br>
And vnto me addoom that is my dew;<br>
That is the rule of all, all being rul'd by you.<p>

So hauing ended, silence long ensewed,<br>
Ne <i>Nature</i> to or fro spake for a space,<br>
But with firme eyes affixt, the ground still viewed.<br>
Meane while, all creatures, looking in her face,<br>
Expecting th'end of this so doubtfull case,<br>
Did hang in long suspence what would ensew,<br>
To whether side should fall the soueraigne place:<br>
At length, she looking vp with chearefull view,<br>
The silence brake, and gaue her doome in speeches few.<p>

I well consider all that ye haue sayd,<br>
And find that all things stedfastnes doe hate<br>
And changed be: yet being rightly wayd<br>
They are not changed from their first estate;<br>
But by their change their being doe dilate:<br>
And turning to themselues at length againe,<br>
Doe worke their owne perfection so by fate:<br>
Then ouer them Change doth not rule and raigne;<br>
But they raigne ouer change, and doe their states maintaine.<p>

Cease therefore daughter further to aspire,<br>
And thee content thus to be rul'd by me:<br>
For thy decay thou seekst by thy desire;<br>
But time shall come that all shall changed bee,<br>
And from thenceforth, none no more change shall see.<br>
So was the <i>Titaness</i> put downe and whist,<br>
And <i>Ioue</i> confirm'd in his imperiall see.<br>
Then was that whole assembly quite dismist,<br>
And <i>Natur's</i> selfe did vanish, whither no man wist.<p>
