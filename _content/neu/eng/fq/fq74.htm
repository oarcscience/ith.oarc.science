<blockquote>
<i>Calidore hostes with Meliboe<br>
and loues fayre Pastorell;<br>
Coridon enuies him, yet he<br>
for ill rewards him well.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
N
Ow turne againe my teme thou iolly swayne,<br>
Backe to the furrow which I lately left;<br>
I lately left a furrow, one or twayne<br>
Vnplough'd, the which my coulter hath not cleft:<br>
Yet seem'd the soyle both fayre and frutefull eft,<br>
As I it past, that were too great a shame,<br>
That so rich frute should be from vs bereft;<br>
Besides the great dishonour and defame,<br>
Which should befall to <i>Calidores</i> immortall name.<p>

Great trauell hath the gentle <i>Calidore</i><br>
And toyle endured, sith I left him last<br>
Sewing the <i>Blatant beast</i>, which I forbore<br>
To finish then, for other present hast.<br>
Full many pathes and perils he hath past,<br>
Through hils, through dales, throgh forests, &amp; throgh plaines<br>
In that same quest which Fortune on him cast,<br>
Which he atchieued to his owne great gaines,<br>
Reaping eternall glorie of his restlesse paines.<p>

So sharply he the Monster did pursew,<br>
That day nor night he suffred him to rest,<br>
Ne rested he himselfe but natures dew,<br>
For dread of daunger, not to be redrest,<br>
If he for slouth forslackt so famous quest.<br>
Him first from court he to the citties coursed,<br>
And from the citties to the townes him prest,<br>
And from the townes into the countrie forsed,<br>
And from the country back to priuate farmes he scorsed.<p>

From thence into the open fields he fled,<br>
Whereas the Heardes were keeping of their neat,<br>
And shepheards singing to their flockes, that fed,<br>
Layes of sweete loue and youthes delightfull heat:<br>
Him thether eke for all his fearefull threat<br>
He followed fast, and chaced him so nie,<br>
That to the folds, where sheepe at night doe seat,<br>
And to the litle cots, where shepherds lie<br>
In winters wrathfull time, he forced him to flie.<p>

There on a day as he pursew'd the chace,<br>
He chaunst to spy a sort of shepheard groomes,<br>
Playing on pypes, and caroling apace,<br>
The whyles their beasts there in the budded broomes<br>
Beside them fed, and nipt the tender bloomes:<br>
For other worldly wealth they cared nought.<br>
To whom Sir <i>Calidore</i> yet sweating comes,<br>
And them to tell him courteously besought,<br>
If such a beast they saw, which he had thether brought.<p>

They answer'd him, that no such beast they saw,<br>
Nor any wicked feend, that mote offend<br>
Their happie flockes, nor daunger to them draw:<br>
But if that such there were (as none they kend)<br>
They prayd high God him farre from them to send.<br>
Then one of them him seeing so to sweat,<br>
After his rusticke wise, that well he weend,<br>
Offred him drinke, to quench his thirstie heat,<br>
And if he hungry were, him offred eke to eat.<p>

The knight was nothing nice, where was no need,<br>
And tooke their gentle offer: so adowne<br>
They prayd him sit, and gaue him for to feed<br>
Such homely what, as serues the simple clowne,<br>
That doth despise the dainties of the towne.<br>
Tho hauing fed his fill, he there besyde<br>
Saw a faire damzell, which did weare a crowne<br>
Of sundry flowres, with silken ribbands tyde,<br>
Yclad in home-made greene that her owne hands had dyde.<p>

Vpon a litle hillocke she was placed<br>
Higher then all the rest, and round about<br>
Enuiron'd with a girland, goodly graced,<br>
Of louely lasses, and them all without<br>
The lustie shepheard swaynes sate in a rout,<br>
The which did pype and sing her prayses dew,<br>
And oft reioyce, and oft for wonder shout,<br>
As if some miracle of heauenly hew<br>
Were downe to them descended in that earthly vew.<p>

And soothly sure she was full fayre of face,<br>
And perfectly well shapt in euery lim,<br>
Which she did more augment with modest grace,<br>
And comely carriage of her count'nance trim,<br>
That all the rest like lesser lamps did dim:<br>
Who her admiring as some heauenly wight,<br>
Did for their soueraine goddesse her esteeme,<br>
And caroling her name both day and night,<br>
The fayrest <i>Pastorella</i> her by name did hight.<p>

Ne was there heard, ne was there shepheards swayne<br>
But her did honour, and eke many a one<br>
Burnt in her loue, and with sweet pleasing payne<br>
Full many a night for her did sigh and grone:<br>
But most of all the shepheard <i>Coridon</i><br>
For her did languish, and his deare life spend;<br>
Yet neither she for him, nor other none<br>
Did care a whit, ne any liking lend:<br>
Though meane her lot, yet higher did her mind ascend.<p>

Her whyles Sir <i>Calidore</i> there vewed well,<br>
And markt her rare demeanure, which him seemed<br>
So farre the meane of shepheards to excell,<br>
As that he in his mind her worthy deemed,<br>
To be a Princes Paragone esteemed,<br>
He was vnwares surprisd in subtile bands<br>
Of the blynd boy, ne thence could be redeemed<br>
By any skill out of his cruell hands;<br>
Caught like the bird, which gazing still on others stands.<p>

So stood he still long gazing thereupon,<br>
Ne any will had thence to moue away,<br>
Although his quest were farre afore him gon;<br>
But after he had fed, yet did he stay,<br>
And sate there still, vntill the flying day<br>
Was farre forth spent, discoursing diuersly<br>
Of sundry things, as fell, to worke delay;<br>
And euermore his speach he did apply<br>
To th'heards, but meant them to the damzels fantazy.<p>

By this the moystie night approching fast,<br>
Her deawy humour gan on th'earth to shed,<br>
That warn'd the shepheards to their homes to hast<br>
Their tender flocks, now being fully fed,<br>
For feare of wetting them before their bed;<br>
Then came to them a good old aged syre,<br>
Whose siluer lockes bedeckt his beard and hed,<br>
With shepheards hooke in hand, and fit attyre,<br>
That wild the damzell rise; the day did now expyre.<p>

He was to weet by common voice esteemed<br>
The father of the fayrest <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
And of her selfe in very deede so deemed;<br>
Yet was not so, but as old stories tell<br>
Found her by fortune, which to him befell,<br>
In th'open fields an Infant left alone,<br>
And taking vp brought home, and noursed well<br>
As his owne chyld; for other he had none,<br>
That she in tract of time accompted was his owne.<p>

She at his bidding meekely did arise,<br>
And streight vnto her litle flocke did fare:<br>
Then all the rest about her rose likewise,<br>
And each his sundrie sheepe with seuerall care<br>
Gathered together, and them homeward bare:<br>
Whylest euerie one with helping hands did striue<br>
Amongst themselues, and did their labours share,<br>
To helpe faire <i>Pastorella</i>, home to driue<br>
Her fleecie flocke; but <i>Coridon</i> most helpe did giue.<p>

But <i>Meliboee</i> (so hight that good old man)<br>
Now seeing <i>Calidore</i> left all alone,<br>
And night arriued hard at hand, began<br>
Him to inuite vnto his simple home;<br>
Which though it were a cottage clad with lome,<br>
And all things therein meane, yet better so<br>
To lodge, then in the saluage fields to rome.<br>
The knight full gladly soone agreed thereto,<br>
Being his harts owne wish, and home with him did go.<p>

There he was welcom'd of that honest syre,<br>
And of his aged Beldame homely well;<br>
Who him besought himselfe to disattyre,<br>
And rest himselfe, till supper time befell.<br>
By which home came the fayrest <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
After her flocke she in their fold had tyde,<br>
And supper readie dight, they to it fell<br>
With small adoe, and nature satisfyde,<br>
The which doth litle craue contented to abyde.<p>

Tho when they had their hunger slaked well,<br>
And the fayre mayd the table ta'ne away,<br>
The gentle knight, as he that did excell<br>
In courtesie, and well could doe and say,<br>
For so great kindnesse as he found that day,<br>
Gan greatly thanke his host and his good wife;<br>
And drawing thence his speach another way,<br>
Gan highly to commend the happie life,<br>
Which Shepheards lead, without debate or bitter strife.<p>

How much (sayd he) more happie is the state,<br>
In which ye father here doe dwell at ease,<br>
Leading a life so free and fortunate,<br>
From all the tempests of these worldly seas,<br>
Which tosse the rest in daungerous disease?<br>
Where warres, and wreckes, and wicked enmitie<br>
Doe them afflict, which no man can appease,<br>
That certes I your happinesse enuie,<br>
And wish my lot were plast in such felicitie.<p>

Surely my sonne (then answer'd he againe)<br>
If happie, then it is in this intent,<br>
That hauing small, yet doe I not complaine<br>
Of want, ne wish for more it to augment,<br>
But doe my self, with that I haue, content;<br>
So taught of nature, which doth litle need<br>
Of forreine helpes to lifes due nourishment:<br>
The fields my food, my flocke my rayment breed;<br>
No better doe I weare, no better doe I feed.<p>

Therefore I doe not any one enuy,<br>
Nor am enuyde of any one therefore;<br>
They that haue much, feare much to loose thereby,<br>
And store of cares doth follow riches store.<br>
The litle that I haue, growes dayly more<br>
Without my care, but onely to attend it;<br>
My lambes doe euery yeare increase their score,<br>
And my flockes father daily doth amend it.<br>
What haue I, but to praise th'Almighty, that doth send it?<p>

To them, that list, the worlds gay showes I leaue,<br>
And to great ones such follies doe forgiue,<br>
Which oft through pride do their owne perill weaue,<br>
And through ambition downe themselues doe driue<br>
To sad decay, that might contented liue.<br>
Me no such cares nor combrous thoughts offend,<br>
Ne once my minds vnmoued quiet grieue,<br>
But all the night in siluer sleepe I spend,<br>
And all the day, to what I list, I doe attend.<p>

Sometimes I hunt the Fox, the vowed foe<br>
Vnto my Lambes, and him dislodge away;<br>
Sometime the fawne I practise from the Doe,<br>
Or from the Goat her kidde how to conuay;<br>
Another while I baytes and nets display,<br>
The birds to catch, or fishes to beguyle:<br>
And when I wearie am, I downe doe lay<br>
My limbes in euery shade, to rest from toyle,<br>
And drinke of euery brooke, when thirst my throte doth boyle.<p>

The time was once, in my first prime of yeares,<br>
When pride of youth forth pricked my desire,<br>
That I disdain'd amongst mine equall peares<br>
To follow sheepe, and shepheards base attire:<br>
For further fortune then I would inquire.<br>
And leauing home, to roiall court I sought;<br>
Where I did sell my selfe for yearely hire,<br>
And in the Princes gardin daily wrought:<br>
There I beheld such vainenesse, as I neuer thought.<p>

With sight whereof soone cloyd, and long deluded<br>
With idle hopes, which them doe entertaine,<br>
After I had ten yeares my selfe excluded<br>
From natiue home, and spent my youth in vaine,<br>
I gan my follies to my selfe to plaine,<br>
And this sweet peace, whose lacke did then appeare.<br>
Tho backe returning to my sheepe againe,<br>
I from thenceforth haue learn'd to loue more deare<br>
This lowly quiet life, which I inherite here.<p>

Whylest thus he talkt, the knight with greedy eare<br>
Hong still vpon his melting mouth attent;<br>
Whose sensefull words empierst his hart so neare,<br>
That he was rapt with double rauishment,<br>
Both of his speach that wrought him great content,<br>
And also of the obiect of his vew,<br>
On which his hungry eye was alwayes bent;<br>
That twixt his pleasing tongue, and her faire hew,<br>
He lost himselfe, and like one halfe entraunced grew.<p>

Yet to occasion meanes, to worke his mind,<br>
And to insinuate his harts desire,<br>
He thus replyde; Now surely syre, I find,<br>
That all this worlds gay showes, which we admire,<br>
Be but vaine shadowes to this safe retyre<br>
Of life, which here in lowlinesse ye lead,<br>
Fearelesse of foes, or fortunes wrackfull yre,<br>
Which tosseth states, and vnder foot doth tread<br>
The mightie ones, affrayd of euery chaunges dread.<p>

That euen I which daily doe behold<br>
The glorie of the great, mongst whom I won,<br>
And now haue prou'd, what happineesse ye hold<br>
In this small plot of your dominion,<br>
Now loath great Lordship and ambition;<br>
And wish the heauens so much had graced mee,<br>
As graunt me liue in like condition;<br>
Or that my fortunes might transposed bee<br>
From pitch of higher place, vnto this low degree.<p>

In vaine (said then old <i>Meliboe</i>) doe men<br>
The heauens of their fortunes fault accuse,<br>
Sith they know best, what is the best for them:<br>
For they to each such fortune doe diffuse,<br>
As they doe know each can most aptly vse.<br>
For not that, which men couet most, is best,<br>
Nor that thing worst, which men do most refuse;<br>
But fittest is, that all contented rest<br>
With that they hold: each hath his fortune in his brest.<p>

It is the mynd, that maketh good or ill,<br>
That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore:<br>
For some, that hath abundance at his will,<br>
Hath not enough, but wants in greatest store;<br>
And other, that hath litle, askes no more,<br>
But in that litle is both rich and wise.<br>
For wisedome is most riches; fooles therefore<br>
They are, which fortunes doe by vowes deuize,<br>
Sith each vnto himselfe his life may fortunize.<p>

Since then in each mans self (said <i>Calidore</i>)<br>
It is, to fashion his owne lyfes estate,<br>
Giue leaue awhyle, good father, in this shore<br>
To rest my barcke, which hath bene beaten late<br>
With stormes of fortune and tempestuous fate,<br>
In seas of troubles and of toylesome paine,<br>
That whether quite from them for to retrate<br>
I shal resolue, or backe to turne againe,<br>
I may here with your selfe some small repose obtaine.<p>

Not that the burden of so bold a guest<br>
Shall chargefull be, or chaunge to you at all;<br>
For your meane food shall be my daily feast,<br>
And this your cabin both my bowre and hall.<br>
Besides for recompence hereof, I shall<br>
You well reward, and golden guerdon giue,<br>
That may perhaps you better much withall,<br>
And in this quiet make you safer liue.<br>
So forth he drew much gold, and toward him it driue.<p>

But the good man, nought tempted with the offer<br>
Of his rich mould, did thrust it farre away,<br>
And thus bespake; Sir knight, your bounteous proffe[r]<br>
Be farre fro me, to whom ye ill display<br>
That mucky masse, the cause of mens decay,<br>
That mote empaire my peace with daungers dread.<br>
But if ye algates couet to assay<br>
This simple sort of life, that shepheards lead,<br>
Be it your owne: our rudenesse to your selfe aread.<p>

So there that night Sir <i>Calidore</i> did dwell,<br>
And long while after, whilest him list remaine,<br>
Dayly beholding the faire <i>Pastorell</i>,<br>
And feeding on the bayt of his owne bane.<br>
During which time he did her entertaine<br>
With all kind courtesies, he could inuent;<br>
And euery day, her companie to gaine,<br>
When to the field she went, he with her went:<br>
So for to quench his fire, he did it more augment.<p>

But she that neuer had acquainted beene<br>
With such queint vsage, fit for Queenes and Kings,<br>
Ne euer had such knightly seruice seene,<br>
But being bred vnder base shepheards wings,<br>
Had euer learn'd to loue the lowly things,<br>
Did litle whit regard his courteous guize,<br>
But cared more for <i>Colins</i> carolings<br>
Then all that he could doe, or euer deuize:<br>
His layes, his loues, his lookes she did them all despize.<p>

Which <i>Calidore</i> perceiuing, thought it best<br>
To chaunge the manner of his loftie looke;<br>
And doffing his bright armes, himselfe addrest<br>
In shepheards weed, and in his hand he tooke,<br>
In stead of steelehead speare, a shepheards hooke;<br>
That who had seene him then, would haue bethought<br>
On <i>Phrygian Paris</i> by <i>Plexippus</i> brooke,<br>
When he the loue of fayre <i>Oenone</i> sought,<br>
What time the golden apple was vnto him brought.<p>

So being clad, vnto the fields he went<br>
With the faire <i>Pastorella</i> euery day,<br>
And kept her sheepe with diligent attent,<br>
Watching to driue the rauenous Wolfe away,<br>
The whylest at pleasure she mote sport and play;<br>
And euery euening helping them to fold:<br>
And otherwhiles for need, he did assay<br>
In his strong hand their rugged teats to hold,<br>
And out of them to presse the milke: loue so much could.<p>

Which seeing <i>Coridon</i>, who her likewise<br>
Long time had lou'd, and hop'd her loue to gaine,<br>
He much was troubled at that straungers guize,<br>
And many gealous thoughts conceiu'd in vaine,<br>
That this of all his labour and long paine<br>
Should reap the haruest, ere it ripened were;<br>
That made him scoule, and pout, and oft complaine<br>
Of <i>Pastorell</i> to all the shepheards there,<br>
That she did loue a stranger swayne then him more dere.<p>

And euer when him came in companie,<br>
Where <i>Calidore</i> was present, he would loure,<br>
And byte his lip, and euen for gealousie<br>
Was readie oft his owne hart to deuoure,<br>
Impatient of any paramoure:<br>
Who on the other side did seeme so farre<br>
From malicing, or grudging his good houre,<br>
That all he could, he graced him with her,<br>
Ne euer shewed signe of rancour or of iarre.<p>

And oft, when <i>Coridon</i> vnto her brought<br>
Or litle sparrowes, stolen from their nest,<br>
Or wanton squirrels, in the woods farre sought,<br>
Or other daintie thing for her addrest,<br>
He would commend his guift, and make the best.<br>
Yet she no whit his presents did regard,<br>
Ne him could find to fancie in her brest:<br>
This newcome shepheard had his market mard.<br>
Old loue is litle worth when new is more prefard.<p>

One day when as the shepheard swaynes together<br>
Were met, to make their sports and merrie glee,<br>
As they are wont in faire sunshynie weather,<br>
The whiles their flockes in shadowes shrouded bee,<br>
They fell to daunce: then did they all agree,<br>
That <i>Colin Clout</i> should pipe as one most fit;<br>
And <i>Calidore</i> should lead the ring, as hee<br>
That most in <i>Pastorellaes</i> grace did sit.<br>
Thereat frown'd <i>Coridon</i>, and his lip closely bit.<p>

But <i>Calidore</i> of courteous inclination<br>
Tooke <i>Coridon</i>, and set him in his place,<br>
That he should lead the daunce, as was his fashion;<br>
For <i>Coridon</i> could daunce, and trimly trace.<br>
And when as <i>Pastorella</i>, him to grace,<br>
Her flowry garlond tooke from her owne head,<br>
And plast on his, he did it soone displace,<br>
And did it put on <i>Coridons</i> in stead:<br>
Then <i>Coridon</i> woxe frollicke, that earst seemed dead.<p>

Another time, when as they did dispose<br>
To practise games, and maisteries to try,<br>
They for their Iudge did <i>Pastorella</i> chose;<br>
A garland was the meed of victory.<br>
There <i>Coridon</i> forth stepping openly,<br>
Did chalenge <i>Calidore</i> to wrestling game:<br>
For he through long and perfect industry,<br>
Therein well practisd was, and in the same<br>
Thought sure t'auenge his grudge, &amp; worke his foe great shame.<p>

But <i>Calidore</i> he greatly did mistake;<br>
For he was strong and mightily stiffe pight,<br>
That with one fall his necke he almost brake,<br>
And had he not vpon him fallen light,<br>
His dearest ioynt he sure had broken quight.<br>
Then was the oaken crowne by <i>Pastorell</i><br>
Giuen to <i>Calidore</i>, as his due right;<br>
But he, that did in courtesie excell,<br>
Gaue it to <i>Coridon</i>, and said he wonne it well.<p>

Thus did the gentle knight himselfe abeare<br>
Amongst that rusticke rout in all his deeds,<br>
That euen they, the which his riuals were,<br>
Could not maligne him, but commend him needs:<br>
For courtesie amongst the rudest breds<br>
Good will and fauour. So it surely wrought<br>
With this faire Mayd, and in her mynde the seeds<br>
Of perfect loue did sow, that last forth brought<br>
The fruite of ioy and blisse, though long time dearely bought.<p>

Thus <i>Calidore</i> continu'd there long time,<br>
To winne the loue of the faire <i>Pastorell</i>;<br>
Which hauing got, he vsed without crime<br>
Or blamefull blot, but menaged so well,<br>
That he of all the rest, which there did [d]well,<br>
Was fauoured, and to her grace commmended.<br>
But what straunge fortunes vnto him befell,<br>
Ere he attain'd the point by him intended,<br>
Shall more conueniently in other place be ended.<p>
