*Cant. II.*

> *Artegall heares of Florimell,  
> Does with the Pagan fight:  
> Him slaies, drownes Lady Munera  
> Does race her castle quight.*

> N Ought is more honorable to a knight,  
> Ne better doth beseeme braue cheualry,  
> Then to defend the feeble in their right,  
> And wrong redresse in such as wend awry.  
> Whilome those great Heroes got thereby  
> Their greatest glory, for their rightfull deedes,  
> And place deserued with the Gods on hy.  
> Herein the noblesse of this knight exceedes,  
> Who now to perils great for iustice sake proceedes.
>
> To which as he now was vppon the way,  
> He chaunst to meet a Dwarfe in hasty course;  
> Whom he requir'd his forward hast to stay,  
> Till he of tidings mote with him discourse.  
> Loth was the Dwarfe, yet did he stay perforse,  
> And gan of sundry newes his store to tell,  
> As to his memory they had recourse:  
> But chiefely of the fairest *Florimell*,  
> How she was found againe, and spousde to *Marinell*.
>
> For this was *Dony*, *Florimels* owne Dwarfe,  
> Whom hauing lost (as ye haue heard whyleare)  
> And finding in the way the scattred scarfe,  
> The fortune of her life long time did feare.  
> But of her health when *Artegall* did heare,  
> And safe returne, he was full inly glad,  
> And askt him where, and when her bridale cheare  
> Should be solemniz'd: for if time he had,  
> He would be there, and honor to her spousall ad.
>
> Within three daies (quoth hee) as I do here,  
> It will be at the Castle of the strond;  
> What time if naught me let, I will be there  
> To doe her seruice, so as I am bond.  
> But in my way a little here beyond  
> A cursed cruell Sarazin doth wonne,  
> That keepes a Bridges passage by strong hond,  
> And many errant Knights hath there fordonne;  
> That makes all men for feare that passage for to shonne.
>
> What mister wight (quoth he) and how far hence  
> Is he, that doth to trauellers such harmes?  
> He is (said he) a man of great defence;  
> Expert in battell and in deedes of armes;  
> And more emboldned by the wicked charmes,  
> With which his daughter doth him still support;  
> Hauing great Lordships got and goodly farmes,  
> Through strong oppression of his powre extort;  
> By which he stil them holds, & keepes with strong effort.
>
> And dayly he his wrongs encreaseth more,  
> For neuer wight he lets to passe that way,  
> Ouer his Bridge, albee he rich or poore,  
> But he him makes his passage-penny pay:  
> Else he doth hold him backe or beat away.  
> Thereto he hath a groome of euill guize,  
> Whose scalp is bare, that bondage doth bewray,  
> Which pols and pils the poore in piteous wize;  
> But he him selfe vppon th rich doth tyrannize.
>
> His name is hight *Pollente*, rightly so  
> For that he is so puissant and strong,  
> That with his powre he all doth ouergo,  
> And makes them subiect to his mighty wrong;  
> And some by sleight he eke doth vnderfong.  
> For on a Bridge he custometh to fight,  
> Which is but narrow, but exceeding long;  
> And in the same are many trap fals pight,  
> Through which the rider downe doth fall through ouersight.
>
> And vnderneath the same a riuer flowes,  
> That is both swift and dangerous deepe withall;  
> Into the which whomso he ouerthrowes,  
> All destitute of helpe doth headlong fall,  
> But he him selfe, through practise vsuall,  
> Leapes forth into the floud, and there assaies  
> His foe confused through his sodaine fall,  
> That horse and man he equally dismaies,  
> And either both them drownes, or trayterously slaies.
>
> Then doth he take the spoile of them at will,  
> And to his daughter brings, that dwels thereby:  
> Who all that comes doth take, and therewith fill  
> The coffers of her wicked threasury;  
> Which she with wrongs hath heaped vp so hy,  
> That many Princes she in wealth exceedes,  
> And purchast all the countrey lying ny  
> With the reuenue of her plenteous meedes:  
> Her name is *Munera*, agreeing with her deedes.
>
> Thereto she is full faire, and rich attired,  
> With golden hands and siluer feete beside,  
> That many Lords haue her to wife desired:  
> But she them all despiseth for great pride.  
> Now by my life (sayd he) and God to guide,  
> None other way will I this day betake,  
> But by that Bridge, whereas he doth abide:  
> Therefore me thither lead. No more he spake,  
> But thitherward forthright his ready way did make.
>
> Vnto the place he came within a while,  
> Where on the Bridge he ready armed saw  
> The Sarazin, awayting for some spoile.  
> Who as they to the passage gan to draw,  
> A villaine to them came with scull all raw,  
> That passage money did of them require,  
> According to the custome of their law.  
> To whom he aunswerd wroth, Loe there thy hire;  
> And with that word him strooke, that streight he did expire.
>
> Which when the Pagan saw, he wexed wroth,  
> And streight him selfe vnto the fight addrest,  
> Ne was Sir *Artegall* behinde: so both  
> Together ran with ready speares in rest.  
> Right in the midst, whereas they brest to brest  
> Should meete, a trap was letten downe to fall  
> Into the floud: streight leapt the Carle vnblest,  
> Well weening that his foe was falne withall:  
> But he was well aware, and leapt before his fall.
>
> There being both together in the floud,  
> They each at other tyrannously flew;  
> Ne ought the water cooled their whot bloud,  
> But rather in them kindled choler new.  
> But there the Paynim, who that vse well knew  
> To fight in water, great aduantage had,  
> That oftentimes him nigh he ouerthrew:  
> And eke the courser, whereuppon he rad,  
> Could swim like to a fish, whiles he his backe bestrad.
>
> Which oddes when as Sir *Artegall* espide,  
> He saw no way, but close with him in hast;  
> And to him driuing strongly downe the tide,  
> Vppon his iron coller griped fast,  
> That with the straint his wesand nigh he brast.  
> There they together stroue and struggled long,  
> Either the other from his steede to cast;  
> Ne euer *Artegall* his griple strong  
> For any thing wold slacke, but still vppon him hong.
>
> As when a Dolphin and a Sele are met,  
> In the wide champian of the Ocean plaine:  
> With cruell chaufe their courages they whet,  
> The maysterdome of each by force to gaine,  
> And dreadfull battaile twixt them do darraine:  
> They snuf, they snort, they bo˜uce, they rage, they rore,  
> That all the sea disturbed with their traine,  
> Doth frie with fome aboue the surges hore.  
> Such was betwixt these two the troublesome vprore.
>
> So *Artegall* at length him forst forsake  
> His horses backe, for dread of being drownd,  
> And to his handy swimming him betake.  
> Eftsoones him selfe he from his hold vnbownd,  
> And then no ods at all in him he fownd:  
> For *Artegall* in swimming skilfull was,  
> And durst the depth of any water sownd.  
> So ought each Knight, that vse of perill has,  
> In swimming be expert through waters force to pas.
>
> Then very doubtfull was the warres euent,  
> Vncertaine whether had the better side:  
> For both were skild in that experiment,  
> And both in armes well traind and throughly tride.  
> But *Artegall* was better breath'd beside,  
> And towards th'end, grew greater in his might,  
> That his faint foe no longer could abide  
> His puissance, ne beare him selfe vpright,  
> But from the water to the land betooke his flight.
>
> But *Artegall* pursewd him still so neare,  
> With bright Chrysaor in his cruell hand,  
> That as his head he gan a litle reare  
> Aboue the brincke, to tread vpon the land,  
> He smote it off, that tumbling on the strand  
> It bit the earth for very fell despight,  
> And gnashed with his teeth, as if he band  
> High God, whose goodnesse he despaired quight,  
> Or curst the hand, which did that vengẽace on him dight.
>
> His corps was carried downe along the Lee,  
> Whose waters with his filthy bloud it stayned:  
> But his blasphemous head, that all might see,  
> He pitcht vpon a pole on high ordayned;  
> Where many years it afterwards remayned,  
> To be a mirrour to all mighty men,  
> In whose right hands great power is contayned,  
> That none of them the feeble ouerren,  
> But alwaies doe their powre within iust compasse pen.
>
> That done, vnto the Castle he did wend,  
> In which the Paynims daughter did abide,  
> Guarded of many which did her defend:  
> Of whom he entrance sought, but was denide,  
> And with reprochfull blasphemy defide,  
> Beaten with stones downe from the battilment,  
> That he was forced to withdraw aside;  
> And bad his seruant *Talus* to inuent  
> Which way he enter might, without endangerment.
>
> Eftsoones his Page drew to the Castle gate,  
> And with his iron flale at it let flie,  
> That all the warders it did sore amate,  
> The which erewhile spake so reprochfully,  
> And made them stoupe, that looked earst so hie.  
> Yet still he bet, and bounst vppon the dore,  
> And thundred strokes thereon so hideouslie,  
> That all the peece he shaked from the flore,  
> And filled all the house with feare and great vprore.
>
> With noise whereof the Lady forth appeared  
> Vppon the Castle wall, and when she saw  
> The daungerous state, in which she stood, she feared  
> The sad effect of her neare ouerthrow;  
> And gan entreat that iron man below,  
> To cease his outrage, and him faire besought,  
> Sith neither force of stones which they did throw,  
> Nor powr of charms, which she against him wrought,  
> Might otherwise preuaile, or make him cease for ought.
>
> But when as yet she saw him to proceede,  
> Vnmou'd with praiers, or with piteous thought,  
> She ment him to corrupt with goodly meede;  
> And causde great sackes with endlesse riches fraught,  
> Vnto the battilment to be vpbrought,  
> And powred forth ouer the Castle wall,  
> That she might win some time, though dearly bought  
> Whilest he to gathering of the gold did fall.  
> But he was nothing mou'd, nor tempted therewithall.
>
> But still continu'd his assault the more,  
> And layd on load with his huge yron flaile,  
> That at the length he has yrent the dore,  
> And made way for his maister to assaile.  
> Who being entred, nought did then auaile  
> For wight, against his powre them selues to reare:  
> Each one did flie; their hearts began to faile,  
> And hid them selues in corners here and there;  
> And eke their dame halfe dead did hide her self for feare.
>
> Long they her sought, yet no where could they finde her,  
> That sure they ween'd she was escapt away:  
> But *Talus*, that could like a limehound winde her,  
> And all things secrete wisely could bewray,  
> At length found out, whereas she hidden lay  
> Vnder an heape of gold. Thence he her drew  
> By the faire lockes, and fowly did array,  
> Withouten pitty of her goodly hew,  
> That *Artegall* him selfe her seemelesse plight did rew.
>
> Yet for no pitty would he change the course  
> Of Iustice, which in *Talus* hand did lye;  
> Who rudely hayld her forth without remorse,  
> Still holding vp her suppliant hands on hye,  
> And kneeling at his feete submissiuely.  
> But he her suppliant hands, those hands of gold,  
> And eke her feete, those feete of siluer trye,  
> Which sought vnrighteousnesse, and iustice sold,  
> Chopt off, and nayld on high, that all might thẽ behold.
>
> Her selfe then tooke he by the sclender wast,  
> In vaine loud crying, and into the flood  
> Ouer the Castle wall adowne her cast,  
> And there her drowned in the durty mud:  
> But the streame washt away her guilty blood.  
> Thereafter all that mucky pelfe he tooke,  
> The spoile of peoples euill gotten good,  
> The which her sire had scrap't by hooke and crooke;  
> And burning all to ashes, powr'd it downe the brooke.
>
> And lastly all that Castle quite he raced,  
> Euen from the sole of his foundation,  
> And all the hewen stones thereof defaced,  
> That there mote be no hope of reparation,  
> Nor memory thereof to any nation.  
> All which when *Talus* throughly had perfourmed,  
> Sir *Artegall* vndid the euill fashion,  
> And wicked customes of that Bridge refourmed.  
> Which done, vnto his former iourney he retourned.
>
> In which they measur'd mickle weary way,  
> Till that at length nigh to the sea they drew;  
> By which as they did trauell on a day,  
> They saw before them, far as they could vew,  
> Full many people gathered in a crew:  
> Whose great assembly they did much admire,  
> For neuer there the like resort they knew.  
> So towardes them they coasted, to enquire  
> What thing so many nations met, did there desire.
>
> There they beheld a mighty Gyant stand  
> Vpon a rocke, and holding forth on hie  
> An huge great paire of ballance in his hand,  
> With which he boasted in his surquedrie,  
> That all the world he would weigh equallie,  
> If ought he had the same to counterpoys.  
> For want whereof he weighed vanity,  
> And fild his ballaunce full of idle toys:  
> Yet was admired much of fooles, women, and boys.
>
> He sayd that he would all the earth vptake,  
> And all the sea, deuided each from either:  
> So would he of the fire one ballaunce make,  
> And one of th'ayre, without or wind, or wether:  
> Then would he ballaunce heauen and hell together,  
> And all that did within them all containe;  
> Of all whose weight, he would not misse a fether.  
> And looke what surplus did of each remaine,  
> He would to his owne part restore the same againe.
>
> For why, he sayd they all vnequall were,  
> And had encroched vppon others share,  
> Like as the sea (which plaine he shewed there)  
> Had worne the earth, so did the fire the aire;  
> So all the rest did others parts empaire.  
> And so were realmes and nations run awry.  
> All which he vndertooke for to repaire,  
> In sort as they were formed aunciently;  
> And all things would reduce vnto equality.
>
> Therefore the vulgar did about him flocke,  
> And cluster thicke vnto his leasings vaine,  
> Like foolish flies about an hony crocke,  
> In hope by him great benefite to gaine,  
> And vncontrolled freedome to obtaine.  
> All which when *Artegall* did see, and heare,  
> How he mis-led the simple peoples traine,  
> In sdeignfull wize he drew vnto him neare,  
> And thus vnto him spake, without regard or feare;
>
> Thou that presum'st to weigh the world anew,  
> And all things to an equall to restore,  
> In stead of right me seemes great wrong dost shew,  
> And far aboue thy forces pitch to sore.  
> For ere thou limit what is lesse or more  
> In euery thing, thou oughtest first to know,  
> What was the poyse of euery part of yore:  
> And looke then how much it doth ouerflow,  
> Or faile thereof, so much is more then iust to trow.
>
> For at the first they all created were  
> In goodly measure, by their Makers might,  
> And weighed out in ballaunces so nere,  
> That not a dram was missing of their right,  
> The earth was in the middle centre pight,  
> In which it doth immoueable abide,  
> Hemd in with waters like a wall in sight;  
> And they with aire, that not a drop can slide:  
> Al which the heauens containe, & in their courses guide.
>
> Such heauenly iustice doth among them raine,  
> That euery one doe know their certaine bound,  
> In which they doe these many yeares remaine,  
> And mongst them al no change hath yet beene found.  
> But if thou now shouldst weigh them new in pound,  
> We are not sure they would so long remaine:  
> All change is perillous, and all chaunce vnsound.  
> Therefore leaue off to weigh them all againe,  
> Till we may be assur'd they shall their course retaine.
>
> Thou foolishe Elfe (said then the Gyant wroth)  
> Seest not, how badly all things present bee,  
> And each estate quite out of order go'th?  
> The sea it selfe doest thou not plainely see  
> Encroch vppon the land there vnder thee;  
> And th'earth it selfe how daily its increast,  
> By all that dying to it turned be?  
> Were it not good that wrong were then surceast,  
> And from the most, that some were giuen to the least?
>
> Therefore I will throw downe these mountaines hie,  
> And make them leuell with the lowly plaine:  
> These towring rocks, which reach vnto the skie,  
> I will thrust downe into the deepest maine,  
> And as they were, them equalize againe.  
> Tyrants that make men subiect to their law,  
> I will suppresse, that they no more may raine;  
> And Lordings curbe, that commons ouer-aw;  
> And all the wealth of rich men to the poore will draw.
>
> Of things vnseene how canst thou deeme aright,  
> Then answered the righteous *Artegall*,  
> Sith thou misdeem'st so much of things in sight?  
> What though the sea with waues continuall  
> Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all:  
> Ne is the earth the lesse, or loseth ought,  
> For whatsoeuer from one place doth fall,  
> Is with the tide vnto an other brought:  
> For there is nothing lost, that may be found, if sought.
>
> Likewise the earth is not augmented more,  
> By all that dying into it doe fade.  
> For of the earth they formed were of yore;  
> How euer gay their blossome or their blade  
> Doe flourish now, they into dust shall vade.  
> What wrong then is it, if that when they die,  
> They turne to that, whereof they first were made?  
> All in the powre of their great Maker lie:  
> All creatures must obey the voice of the most hie.
>
> They liue, they die, like as he doth ordaine,  
> Ne euer any asketh reason why.  
> The hils doe not the lowly dales disdaine;  
> The dales doe not the lofty hils enuy.  
> He maketh Kings to sit in souerainty;  
> He maketh subiects to their powre obay;  
> He pulleth downe, he setteth vp on hy;  
> He giues to this, from that he takes away.  
> For all we haue is his: what he list doe, he may.
>
> What euer thing is done, by him is donne,  
> Ne any may his mighty will withstand;  
> Ne any may his soueraine power shonne,  
> Ne loose that he hath bound with stedfast band.  
> In vaine therefore doest thou now take in hand,  
> To call to count, or weigh his workes anew,  
> Whose counsels depth thou canst not vnderstand,  
> Sith of things subiect to thy daily vew  
> Thou doest not know the causes, nor their courses dew.
>
> For take thy ballaunce, if thou be so wise,  
> And weigh the winde, that vnder heauen doth blow;  
> Or weigh the light, that in the East doth rise;  
> Or weigh the thought, that frõ mans mind doth flow.  
> But if the weight of these thou canst not show,  
> Weigh but one word which from thy lips doth fall.  
> For how canst thou those greater secrets know,  
> That doest not know the least thing of them all?  
> Ill can he rule the great, that cannot reach the small.
>
> Therewith the Gyant much abashed sayd;  
> That he of little things made reckoning light,  
> Yet the least word that euer could be layd  
> Within his ballaunce, he could way aright.  
> Which is (sayd he) more heauy then in weight,  
> The right or wrong, the false or else the trew?  
> He answered, that he would try it streight,  
> So he the words into his ballaunce threw,  
> But streight the winged words out of his ballaunce flew.
>
> Wroth wext he then, and sayd, that words were light,  
> Ne would within his ballaunce well abide.  
> But he could iustly weigh the wrong or right.  
> Well then, sayd *Artegall*, let it be tride.  
> First in one ballance set the true aside.  
> He did so first; and then the false he layd  
> In th'other scale; but still it downe did slide,  
> And by no meane could in the weight be stayd.  
> For by no meanes the false will with the truth be wayd.
>
> Now take the right likewise, sayd *Artegale*,  
> And counterpeise the same with so much wrong.  
> So first the right he put into one scale;  
> And then the Gyant stroue with puissance strong  
> To fill the other scale with so much wrong.  
> But all the wrongs that he therein could lay,  
> Might not it peise; yet did he labour long,  
> And swat, and chauf'd, and proued euery way:  
> Yet all the wrongs could not a litle right downe lay.
>
> Which when he saw, he greatly grew in rage,  
> And almost would his balances haue broken:  
> But *Artegall* him fairely gan asswage,  
> And said; Be not vpon thy balance wroken:  
> For they doe nought but right or wrong betoken;  
> But in the mind the doome of right must bee;  
> And so likewise of words, the which be spoken,  
> The eare must be the ballance, to decree  
> And iudge, whether with truth or falshood they agree.
>
> But set the truth and set the right aside,  
> For they with wrong or falshood will not fare;  
> And put two wrongs together to be tride,  
> Or else two falses, of each equall share;  
> And then together doe them both compare.  
> For truth is one, and right is euer one.  
> So did he, and then plaine it did appeare,  
> Whether of them the greater were attone.  
> But right sate in the middest of the beame alone.
>
> But he the right from thence did thrust away,  
> For it was not the right, which he did seeke;  
> But rather stroue extremities to way,  
> Th'one to diminish, th'other for to eeke.  
> For of the meane he greatly did misleeke.  
> Whom when so lewdly minded *Talus* found,  
> Approching nigh vnto him cheeke by cheeke,  
> He shouldered him from off the higher ground,  
> And down the rock him throwing, in the sea him dround.
>
> Like as a ship, whom cruell tempest driues  
> Vpon a rocke with horrible dismay,  
> Her shattered ribs in thousand peeces riues,  
> And spoyling all her geares and goodly ray,  
> Does make her selfe misfortunes piteous pray.  
> So downe the cliffe the wretched Gyant tumbled;  
> His battred ballances in peeces lay,  
> His timbered bones all broken rudely rumbled:  
> So was the high aspyring with huge ruine humbled.
>
> That when the people, which had there about  
> Long wayted, saw his sudden desolation,  
> They gan to gather in tumultuous rout,  
> And mutining, to stirre vp ciuill faction,  
> For certaine losse of so great expectation.  
> For well they hoped to haue got great good,  
> And wondrous riches by his innouation.  
> Therefore resoluing to reuenge his blood,  
> They rose in armes, and all in battell order stood.
>
> Which lawlesse multitude him comming too  
> In warlike wise, when *Artegall* did vew,  
> He much was troubled, ne wist what to doo.  
> For loth he was his noble hands t'embrew  
> In the base blood of such a rascall crew;  
> And otherwise, if that he should retire,  
> He fear'd least they with shame would him pursew.  
> Therefore he *Talus* to them sent, t'inquire  
> The cause of their array, and truce for to desire.
>
> But soone as they him nigh approching spide,  
> They gan with all their weapons him assay,  
> And rudely stroke at him on euery side:  
> Yet nought they could him hurt, ne ought dismay.  
> But when at them he with his flaile gan lay,  
> He like a swarme of flyes them ouerthrew;  
> Ne any of them durst come in his way,  
> But here and there before his presence flew,  
> And hid themselues in holes and bushes from his vew.
>
> As when a Faulcon hath with nimble flight  
> Flowne at a flush of Ducks, foreby the brooke,  
> The trembling foule dismayd with dreadfull sight  
> Of death, the which them almost ouertooke,  
> Doe hide themselues from her astonying looke,  
> Amongst the flags and couert round about.  
> When *Talus* saw they all the field forsooke  
> And none appear'd of all that raskall rout,  
> To *Artegall* he turn'd, and went with him throughout.
