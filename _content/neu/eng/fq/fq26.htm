<blockquote>
I
T falles me here to write of Chastity,<br>
That fairest vertue, farre aboue the rest;<br>
For which what needs me fetch from <i>Faery</i><br>
Forreine ensamples, it to haue exprest?<br>
Sith it is shrined in my Soueraines brest,<br>
And form'd so liuely in each perfect part<br>
That to all Ladies, which haue it profest,<br>
Need but behold the pourtraict of her hart,<br>
If pourtrayd it might be by any liuing art.<p>

But liuing art may not least part expresse,<br>
Nor life-resembling pencill it can paint,<br>
All were it <i>Zeuxis</i> or <i>Praxiteles:</i><br>
His daedale hand would faile, and greatly faint,<br>
And her perfections with his error taint:<br>
Ne Poets wit, that passeth Painter farre<br>
In picturing the parts of beautie daint,<br>
So hard a workmanship aduenture darre,<br>
For fear through want of words her excellence to marre.<p>

How then shall I, Apprentice of the skill,<br>
That whylome in diuinest wits did raine,<br>
Presume so high to stretch mine humble quill?<br>
Yet now my lucklesse lot doth me constraine<br>
Hereto perforce.  But &ocirc; dred Soueraine<br>
Thus farre forth pardon, sith that choicest wit<br>
Cannot your glorious pourtraict figure plaine<br>
That I in colourd showes may shadow it,<br>
And antique praises vnto present persons fit.<p>

But if in liuing colours, and right hew,<br>
Your selfe you couet to see pictured,<br>
Who can it doe more liuely, or more trew,<br>
Then that sweet verse, with <i>Nectar</i> sprinckeled,<br>
In which a gracious seruant pictured<br>
His <i>Cynthia</i>, his heauens fairest light?<br>
That with his melting sweetnesse rauished,<br>
And with the wonder of her beames bright,<br>
My senses lulled are in slomber of delight.<p>

But let that same delitious Poet lend<br>
A little leaue vnto a rusticke Muse<br>
To sing his mistresse prayse, and let him mend,<br>
If ought amis her liking may abuse:<br>
Ne let his fairest <i>Cynthia</i> refuse,<br>
In mirrours more then one her selfe to see,<br>
But either <i>Gloriana</i> let her chuse,<br>
Or in <i>Belphoebe</i> fashioned to bee:<br>
In th'one her rule, in th'other her rare chastitee.<p>
