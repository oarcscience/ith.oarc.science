<blockquote>
<i>Prince Arthure and Sir Artegall,<br>
Free Samient from feare:<br>
They slay the Soudan, driue his wife<br>
Adicia to despaire.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
N
Ought vnder heauen so strongly doth allure<br>
The sence of man, and all his minde possesse,<br>
As beauties louely baite, that doth procure<br>
Great warriours oft their rigour to represse,<br>
And mighty hands forget their manlinesse;<br>
Drawne with the powre of an heart-robbing eye,<br>
And wrapt in fetters of a golden tresse,<br>
That can with melting pleasaunce mollifye<br>
Their hardned hearts, enur'd to bloud and cruelty.<p>

So whylome learnd that mighty Iewish swaine,<br>
Each of whose lockes did match a man in might,<br>
To lay his spoiles before his lemans traine:<br>
So also did that great Oetean Knight<br>
For his loues sake his Lions skin vndight:<br>
And so did warlike <i>Antony</i> neglect<br>
The worlds whole rule for <i>Cleopatras</i> sight.<br>
Such wondrous powre hath wemens faire aspect,<br>
To captiue men, and make them all the world reiect.<p>

Yet could it not sterne <i>Artegall</i> retaine,<br>
Nor hold from suite of his auowed quest,<br>
Which he had vndertane to <i>Gloriane</i>;<br>
But left his loue, albe her strong request,<br>
Faire <i>Britomart</i> in languor and vnrest,<br>
And rode him selfe vppon his first intent:<br>
Ne day nor night did euer idly rest;<br>
Ne wight but onely <i>Talus</i> with him went,<br>
The true guide of his way and vertuous gouernment.<p>

So trauelling, he chaunst far off to heed<br>
A Damzell, flying on a palfrey fast<br>
Before two Knights, that after her did speed<br>
With all their powre, and her full fiercely chast<br>
In hope to haue her ouerhent at last:<br>
Yet fled she fast, and both them farre outwent,<br>
Carried with wings of feare, like fowle aghast,<br>
With locks all loose, and rayment all to rent;<br>
And euer as she rode, her eye was backeward bent.<p>

Soone after these he saw another Knight,<br>
That after those two former rode apace,<br>
With speare in rest, and prickt with all his might:<br>
So ran they all, as they had bene at bace,<br>
They being chased, that did others chase.<br>
At length he saw the hindmost ouertake<br>
One of those two, and force him turne his face;<br>
How euer loth he were his way to slake,<br>
Yet mote he algates now abide, and answere make.<p>

But th'other still pursu'd the fearefull Mayd;<br>
Who still from him as fast away did flie,<br>
Ne once for ought her speedy passage stayd,<br>
Till that at length she did before her spie<br>
Sir <i>Artegall</i>, to whom she streight did hie<br>
With gladfull hast, in hope of him to get<br>
Succour against her greedy enimy:<br>
Who seeing her approch gan forward set,<br>
To saue her from her feare, and him from force to let.<p>

But he like hound full greedy of his pray,<br>
Being impatient of impediment,<br>
Continu'd still his course, and by the way<br>
Thought with his speare him quight haue ouerwent.<br>
So both together ylike felly bent,<br>
Like fiercely met. But <i>Artegall</i> was stronger,<br>
And better skild in Tilt and Turnament,<br>
And bore him quite out of his saddle, longer<br>
Then two speares length; So mischiefe ouermatcht the wronger.<p>

And in his fall misfortune him mistooke;<br>
For on his head vnhappily he pight,<br>
That his owne waight his necke asunder broke,<br>
And left there dead. Meane while the other Knight<br>
Defeated had the other faytour quight,<br>
And all his bowels in his body brast:<br>
Whom leauing there in that dispiteous plight,<br>
He ran still on, thinking to follow fast<br>
His other fellow Pagan, which before him past.<p>

In stead of whom finding there ready prest<br>
Sir <i>Artegall</i>, without discretion<br>
He at him ran, with ready speare in rest:<br>
Who seeing him come still so fiercely on,<br>
Against him made againe.  So both anon<br>
Together met, and strongly either strooke<br>
And broke their speares; yet neither has forgon<br>
His horses backe, yet to and fro long shooke,<br>
And tottred like two towres, which through a tempest quooke.<p>

But when againe they had recouered sence,<br>
They drew their swords, in mind to make amends<br>
For what their speares had fayld of their pretence.<br>
Which when the Damzell, who those deadly ends<br>
Of both her foes had seene, and now her frends<br>
For her beginning a more fearefull fray,<br>
She to them runnes in hast, and her haire rends,<br>
Crying to them their cruell hands to stay,<br>
Vntill they both doe heare, what she to them will say.<p>

They stayd their hands, when she thus gan to speake;<br>
Ah gentle Knights, what meane ye thus vnwise<br>
Vpon your selues anothers wrong to wreake?<br>
I am the wrong'd, whom ye did enterprise<br>
Both to redresse, and both redrest likewise:<br>
Witnesse the Paynims both, whom ye may see<br>
There dead on ground. What doe ye then deuise<br>
Of more reuenge? if more, then I am shee,<br>
Which was the roote of all, end your reuenge on mee.<p>

Whom when they heard so say, they lookt about,<br>
To weete if it were true, as she had told;<br>
Where when they saw their foes dead out of doubt,<br>
Eftsoones they gan their wrothfull hands to hold,<br>
And Ventailes reare, each other to behold.<br>
Tho when as <i>Artegall</i> did <i>Arthure</i> vew,<br>
So faire a creature, and so wondrous bold,<br>
He much admired both his heart and hew,<br>
And touched with intire affection, nigh him drew.<p>

Saying, Sir Knight, of pardon I you pray,<br>
That all vnweeting haue you wrong'd thus sore,<br>
Suffring my hand against my heart to stray:<br>
Which if ye please forgiue, I will therefore<br>
Yeeld for amends my selfe yours euermore,<br>
Or what so penaunce shall by you be red.<br>
To whom the Prince; Certes me needeth more<br>
To craue the same, whom errour so misled,<br>
As that I did mistake the liuing for the ded.<p>

But sith ye please, that both our blames shall die,<br>
Amends may for the trespasse soone be made,<br>
Since neither is endamadg'd much thereby.<br>
So can they both them selues full eath perswade<br>
To faire accordaunce, and both faults to shade,<br>
Either embracing other louingly,<br>
And swearing faith to either on his blade,<br>
Neuer thenceforth to nourish enmity,<br>
But either others cause to maintaine mutually.<p>

Then <i>Artegall</i> gan of the Prince enquire,<br>
What were those knights, which there on grou&#361;d were layd,<br>
And had receiu'd their follies worthy hire,<br>
And for what cause they chased so that Mayd.<br>
Certes I wote not well (the Prince then sayd)<br>
But by aduenture found them faring so,<br>
As by the way vnweetingly I strayd,<br>
And lo the Damzell selfe, whence all did grow,<br>
Of whom we may at will the whole occasion know.<p>

Then they that Damzell called to them nie,<br>
And asked her, what were those two her fone,<br>
From whom she earst so fast away did flie;<br>
And what was she her selfe so woe begone,<br>
And for what cause pursu'd of them attone.<br>
To whom she thus; Then wote ye well, that I<br>
Doe serue a Queene, that not far hence doth wone,<br>
A Princesse of great powre and maiestie,<br>
Famous through all the world, and honor'd far and nie.<p>

Her name <i>Mercilla</i> most men vse to call;<br>
That is a mayden Queene of high renowne,<br>
For her great bounty knowen ouer all,<br>
And soueraine grace, with which her royall crowne<br>
She doth support, and strongly beateth downe<br>
The malice of her foes, which her enuy,<br>
And at her happinesse do fret and frowne:<br>
Yet she her selfe the more doth magnify,<br>
And euen to her foes her mercies multiply.<p>

Mongst many which maligne her happy state,<br>
There is a mighty man, which wonnes here by<br>
That with most fell despight and deadly hate,<br>
Seekes to subuert her Crowne and dignity,<br>
And all his powre doth thereunto apply:<br>
And her good Knights, of which so braue a band<br>
Serues her, as any Princesse vnder sky,<br>
He either spoiles, if they against him stand,<br>
Or to his part allures, and bribeth vnder hand.<p>

Ne him sufficeth all the wrong and ill,<br>
Which he vnto her people does each day,<br>
But that he seekes by traytrous traines to spill<br>
Her person, and her sacred selfe to slay:<br>
That O ye heauens defend, and turne away<br>
From her, vnto the miscreant him selfe,<br>
That neither hath religion nor fay,<br>
But makes his God of his vngodly pelfe,<br>
And Idols serues; so let his Idols serue the Elfe.<p>

To all which cruell tyranny they say,<br>
He is prouokt, and stird vp day and night<br>
By his bad wife, that hight <i>Adicia</i>,<br>
Who counsels him through confidence of might,<br>
To breake all bonds of law, and rules of right.<br>
For she her selfe professeth mortall foe<br>
To Iustice, and against her still doth fight,<br>
Working to all, that loue her, deadly woe,<br>
And making all her Knights and people to doe so.<p>

Which my liege Lady seeing, thought it best,<br>
With that his wife in friendly wise to deale,<br>
For stint of strife, and stablishment of rest<br>
Both to her selfe, and to her commonweale,<br>
And all forepast displeasures to repeale.<br>
So me in message vnto her she sent,<br>
To treat with her by way of enterdeale,<br>
Of finall peace and faire attonement,<br>
Which might concluded be by mutuall consent.<p>

All times haue wont safe passage to afford<br>
To messengers, that come for causes iust:<br>
But this proude Dame disdayning all accord,<br>
Not onely into bitter termes forth brust,<br>
Reuiling me, and rayling as she lust,<br>
But lastly to make proofe of vtmost shame,<br>
Me like a dog she out of dores did thrust,<br>
Miscalling me by many a bitter name,<br>
That neuer did her ill, ne once deserued blame.<p>

And lastly, that no shame might wanting be,<br>
When I was gone, soone after me she sent<br>
These two false Knights, whom there ye lying see,<br>
To be by them dishonoured and shent:<br>
But thankt be God, and your good hardiment,<br>
They haue the price of their owne folly payd.<br>
So said this Damzell, that hight <i>Samient</i>,<br>
And to those knights, for their so noble ayd,<br>
Her selfe most gratefull shew'd, &amp; heaped thanks repayd.<p>

But they now hauing throughly heard, and seene<br>
Al those great wrongs, the which that mayd complained<br>
To haue bene done against her Lady Queene,<br>
By that proud dame, which her so much disdained,<br>
Were moued much thereat, and twixt them fained,<br>
With all their force to worke auengement strong<br>
Vppon the Souldan selfe, which it mayntained,<br>
And on his Lady, th'author of that wrong,<br>
And vppon all those Knights, that did to her belong.<p>

But thinking best by counterfet disguise<br>
To their deseigne to make the easier way,<br>
They did this complot twixt them selues deuise,<br>
First, that sir <i>Artegall</i> should him array,<br>
Like one of those two Knights, which dead there lay.<br>
And then that Damzell, the sad <i>Samient</i>,<br>
Should as his purchast prize with him conuay<br>
Vnto the Souldans court, her to present<br>
Vnto his scornefull Lady, that for her had sent.<p>

So as they had deuiz'd, sir <i>Artegall</i><br>
Him clad in th'armour of a Pagan knight,<br>
And taking with him, as his vanquisht thrall,<br>
That Damzell, led her to the Souldans right.<br>
Where soone as his proud wife of her had sight,<br>
Forth of her window as she looking lay,<br>
She weened streight, it was her Paynim Knight,<br>
Which brought that Damzell, as his purchast pray;<br>
And sent to him a Page, that mote direct his way.<p>

Who bringing them to their appointed place,<br>
Offred his seruice to disarme the Knight;<br>
But he refusing him to let vnlace,<br>
For doubt to be discouered by his sight,<br>
Kept himselfe still in his straunge armour dight.<br>
Soone after whom the Prince arriued there,<br>
And sending to the Souldan in despight<br>
A bold defyance, did of him requere<br>
That Damzell, whom he held as wrongfull prisonere.<p>

Wherewith the Souldan all with furie fraught,<br>
Swearing, and banning most blasphemously,<br>
Commaunded straight his armour to be brought,<br>
And mounting straight vpon a charret hye,<br>
With yron wheeles and hookes arm'd dreadfully,<br>
And drawne of cruell steedes, which he had fed<br>
With flesh of men, whom through fell tyranny<br>
He slaughtred had, and ere they were halfe ded,<br>
Their bodies to his beasts for prouender did spred.<p>

So forth he came all in a cote of plate,<br>
Burnisht with bloudie rust, whiles on the greene<br>
The Briton Prince him readie did awayte,<br>
In glistering armes right goodly well beseene,<br>
That shone as bright, as doth the heauen sheene;<br>
And by his stirrup <i>Talus</i> did attend,<br>
Playing his pages part, as he had beene<br>
Before directed by his Lord; to th'end<br>
He should his flale to finall execution bend.<p>

Thus goe they both together to their geare,<br>
With like fierce minds, but meanings different:<br>
For the proud Souldan with presumpteous cheare,<br>
And countenance sublime and insolent,<br>
Sought onely slaughter and auengement:<br>
But the braue Prince for honour and for right,<br>
Gainst tortious powre and lawlesse regiment,<br>
In the behalfe of wronged weake did fight:<br>
More in his causes truth he trusted then in might.<p>

Like to the <i>Thracian</i> Tyrant, who they say<br>
Vnto his horses gaue his guests for meat,<br>
Till he himselfe was made their greedie pray,<br>
And torne in peeces by <i>Alcides</i> great.<br>
So thought the Souldan in his follies threat,<br>
Either the Prince in peeces to haue torne<br>
With his sharpe wheeles, in his first rages heat,<br>
Or vnder his fierce horses feet haue borne<br>
And trampled downe in dust his thoughts disdained scorne.<p>

But the bold child that perill well espying,<br>
If he too rashly to his charet drew,<br>
Gaue way vnto his horses speedie flying,<br>
And their resistlesse rigour did eschew.<br>
Yet as he passed by, the Pagan threw<br>
A shiuering dart with so impetuous force,<br>
That had he not it shun'd with heedfull vew,<br>
It had himselfe transfixed, or his horse,<br>
Or made them both one masse withouten more remorse.<p>

Oft drew the Prince vnto his charret nigh,<br>
In hope some stroke to fasten on him neare;<br>
But he was mounted in his seat so high,<br>
And his wingfooted coursers him did beare<br>
So fast away, that ere his readie speare<br>
He could aduance, he farre was gone and past.<br>
Yet still he him did follow euerywhere,<br>
And followed was of him likewise full fast;<br>
So long as in his steedes the flaming breath did last.<p>

Againe the Pagan threw another dart,<br>
Of which he had with him abundant store,<br>
On euery side of his embatteld cart,<br>
And of all other weapons lesse or more,<br>
Which warlike vses had deuiz'd of yore.<br>
The wicked shaft guyded through th'ayrie wyde,<br>
By some bad spirit, that it to mischiefe bore,<br>
Stayd not, till through his curat it did glyde,<br>
And made a griesly wound in his enriuen side.<p>

Much was he grieued with that haplesse throe,<br>
That opened had the welspring of his blood;<br>
But much the more that to his hatefull foe<br>
He mote not come, to wreake his wrathfull mood.<br>
That made him raue, like to a Lyon wood,<br>
Which being wounded of the huntsmans hand<br>
Can not come neare him in the couert wood,<br>
Where he with boughes hath built his shady stand,<br>
And fenst himselfe about with many a flaming brand.<p>

Still when he sought t'approch vnto him ny,<br>
His charret wheeles about him whirled round,<br>
And made him backe againe as fast to fly;<br>
And eke his steedes like to an hungry hound,<br>
That hunting after game hath carrion found,<br>
So cruelly did him pursew and chace,<br>
That his good steed, all were he much renound<br>
For noble courage, and for hardie race,<br>
Durst not endure their sight, but fled from place to place.<p>

Thus long they trast, and trauerst to and fro,<br>
Seeking by euery way to make some breach,<br>
Yet could the Prince not nigh vnto him goe,<br>
That one sure stroke he might vnto him reach,<br>
Whereby his strengthes assay he might him teach.<br>
At last from his victorious shield he drew<br>
The vaile, which did his powrefull light empeach;<br>
And comming full before his horses vew,<br>
As they vpon him prest, it plaine to them did shew.<p>

Like lightening flash, that hath the gazer burned,<br>
So did the sight thereof their sense dismay,<br>
That backe againe vpon themselues they turned,<br>
And with their ryder ranne perforce away:<br>
Ne could the Souldan them from flying stay,<br>
With raynes, or wonted rule, as well he knew.<br>
Nought feared they, what he could do, or say,<br>
But th'onely feare, that was before their vew;<br>
From which like mazed deare, dismayfully they flew.<p>

Fast did they fly, as them their feete could beare,<br>
High ouer hilles, and lowly ouer dales,<br>
As they were follow'd of their former feare.<br>
In vaine the Pagan bannes, and sweares, and rayles,<br>
And backe with both his hands vnto him hayles<br>
The resty raynes, regarded now no more:<br>
He to them calles and speakes, yet nought auayles;<br>
They heare him not, they haue forgot his lore,<br>
But go, which way they list, their guide they haue forlore.<p>

As when the firie-mouthed steeds, which drew<br>
The Sunnes bright wayne to <i>Phaetons</i> decay,<br>
Soone as they did the monstrous Scorpion vew,<br>
With vgly craples crawling in their way,<br>
The dreadfull sight did them so sore affray,<br>
That their well knowen courses they forwent,<br>
And leading th'euer-burning lampe astray,<br>
This lower world nigh all to ashes brent,<br>
And left their scorched path yet in the firmament.<p>

Such was the furie of these head-strong steeds,<br>
Soone as the infants sunlike shield they saw,<br>
That all obedience both to words and deeds<br>
They quite forgot, and scornd all former law;<br>
Through woods, and rocks, and mountaines they did draw<br>
The yron charet, and the wheeles did teare,<br>
And tost the Paynim, without feare or awe;<br>
From side to side they tost him here and there,<br>
Crying to them in vaine, that nould his crying heare.<p>

Yet still the Prince pursew'd him close behind,<br>
Oft making offer him to smite, but found<br>
No easie meanes according to his mind.<br>
At last they haue all ouerthrowne to ground<br>
Quite topside turuey, and the pagan hound<br>
Amongst the yron hookes and graples keene,<br>
Torne all to rags, and rent with many a wound,<br>
That no whole peece of him was to be seene,<br>
But scattred all about, and strow'd vpon the greene.<p>

Like as the cursed sonne of <i>Theseus</i>,<br>
That following his chace in dewy morne,<br>
To fly his stepdames loues outrageous,<br>
Of his owne steedes was all to peeces torne,<br>
And his faire limbs left in the woods forlorne;<br>
That for his sake <i>Diana</i> did lament,<br>
And all the wooddy Nymphes did wayle and mourne.<br>
So was this Souldan rapt and all to rent,<br>
That of his shape appear'd no litle moniment.<p>

Onely his shield and armour, which there lay,<br>
Though nothing whole, but all to brusd and broken,<br>
He vp did take, and with him brought away,<br>
That mote remaine for an eternall token<br>
To all, mongst whom this storie should be spoken,<br>
How worthily, by heauens high decree,<br>
Iustice that day of wrong her selfe had wroken,<br>
That all men which that spectacle did see,<br>
By like ensample mote for euer warned bee.<p>

So on a tree, before the Tyrants dore,<br>
He caused them be hung in all mens sight,<br>
To be a moniment for euermore.<br>
Which when his Ladie from the castles hight<br>
Beheld, it much appald her troubled spright:<br>
Yet not, as women wont in dolefull fit,<br>
She was dismayd, or faynted through affright,<br>
But gathered vnto her her troubled wit,<br>
And gan eftsoones deuize to be aueng'd for it.<p>

Streight downe she ranne, like an enraged cow,<br>
That is berobbed of her youngling dere,<br>
With knife in hand, and fatally did vow,<br>
To wreake her on that mayden messengere,<br>
Whom she had causd be kept as prisonere,<br>
By <i>Artegall</i>, misween'd for her owne Knight,<br>
That brought her backe.  And comming present there,<br>
She at her ran with all her force and might,<br>
All flaming with reuenge and furious despight.<p>

Like raging <i>Ino</i>, when with knife in hand<br>
She threw her husbands murdred infant out,<br>
Or fell <i>Medea</i>, when on <i>Colchicke</i> strand<br>
Her brothers bones she scattered all about;<br>
Or as that madding mother, mongst the rout<br>
Of <i>Bacchus</i> Priests her owne deare flesh did teare.<br>
Yet neither <i>Ino</i>, nor <i>Medea</i> stout,<br>
Nor all the <i>Moenades</i> so furious were,<br>
As this bold woman, when she saw that Damzell there.<p>

But <i>Artegall</i> being thereof aware,<br>
Did stay her cruell hand, ere she her raught,<br>
And as she did her selfe to strike prepare,<br>
Out of her fist the wicked weapon caught:<br>
With that like one enfelon'd or distraught,<br>
She forth did rome, whether her rage her bore,<br>
With franticke passion, and with furie fraught;<br>
And breaking forth out at a posterne dore,<br>
Vnto the wyld wood ranne, her dolours to deplore.<p>

As a mad bytch, when as the franticke fit<br>
Her burning tongue with rage inflamed hath,<br>
Doth runne at randon, and with furious bit<br>
Snatching at euery thing, doth wreake her wrath<br>
On man and beast, that commeth in her path.<br>
There they doe say, that she transformed was<br>
Into a Tygre, and that Tygres scath<br>
In crueltie and outrage she did pas,<br>
To proue her surname true, that she imposed has.<p>

Then <i>Artegall</i> himselfe dicouering plaine,<br>
Did issue forth gainst all that warlike rout<br>
Of knights and armed men, which did maintaine<br>
That Ladies part, and to the Souldan lout:<br>
All which he did assault with courage stout,<br>
All were they nigh an hundred knights of name:<br>
And like wyld Goates them chaced all about,<br>
Flying from place to place with cowheard shame,<br>
So that with finall force them all he ouercame.<p>

Then caused he the gates be opened wyde,<br>
And there the Prince, as victour of that day,<br>
With tryumph entertayn'd and glorifyde,<br>
Presenting him with all the rich array,<br>
And roiall pompe, which there long hidden lay,<br>
Purchast through lawlesse powre and tortious wrong<br>
Of that proud Souldan, whom he earst did slay.<br>
So both for rest there hauing stayd not long,<br>
Marcht with that mayd, fit matter for another song.<p>
