<i>Guyon does Furor bind in chaines,<br>
and stops Occasion:<br>
Deliuers Phedon, and therefore<br>

<blockquote> 
I
N braue pursuit of honorable deed,<br>
There is I know not what great difference<br>
Betweene the vulgar and the noble seed,<br>
Which vnto things of valorous pretence<br>
Seemes to be borne by natiue influence;<br>
As feates of armes, and loue to entertaine,<br>
But chiefly skill to ride, seemes a science<br>
Proper to gentle bloud; some others faine<br>
To menage steeds, as did this vaunter; but in vaine.<p>
 
But he the rightfull owner of that steed,<br>
Who well could menage and subdew his pride,<br>
The whiles on foot was forced for to yeed,<br>
With that blacke Palmer, his most trusty guide;<br>
Who suffred not his wandring feet to slide.<br>
But when strong passion, or weake fleshlinesse<br>
Would from the right way seeke to draw him wide,<br>
He would through temperance and stedfastnesse,<br>
Teach him the weake to strengthen, &amp; the str&otilde;g suppresse.<p>
 
It fortuned forth faring on his way,<br>
He saw from farre, or seemed for to see<br>
Some troublous vprore or contentious fray,<br>
Whereto he drew in haste it to agree.<br>
A mad man, or that feigned mad to bee,<br>
Drew by the haire along vpon the ground,<br>
A handsome stripling with great crueltee,<br>
Whom sore he bett, and gor'd with many a wound,<br>
That cheekes with teares, and sides with bloud did all abound.<p>
 
And him behind, a wicked Hag did stalke,<br>
In ragged robes, and filthy disaray,<br>
Her other leg was lame, that she no'te walke,<br>
But on a staffe her feeble steps did stay;<br>
Her lockes, that loathly were and hoarie gray,<br>
Grew all afore, and loosely hong vnrold,<br>
But all behind was bald, and worne away,<br>
That none thereof could euer taken hold,<br>
And eke her face ill fauourd, full of wrinckles old.<p>
 
And euer as she went, her tongue did walke<br>
In foule reproch, and termes of vile despight,<br>
Prouoking him by her outrageous talke,<br>
To heape more vengeance on that wretched wight;<br>
Sometimes she raught him stones, wherwith to smite,<br>
Sometimes her staffe, though it her one leg were,<br>
Withouten which she could not go vpright;<br>
Ne any euill meanes she did forbeare,<br>
That might him moue to wrath, and indignation reare.<p>
 
The noble <i>Guyon</i> mou'd with great remorse,<br>
Approching, first the Hag did thrust away,<br>
And after adding more impetuous forse,<br>
His mightie hands did on the madman lay,<br>
And pluckt him backe; who all on fire streightway,<br>
Against him turning all his fell intent,<br>
With beastly brutish rage gan him assay,<br>
And smot, and bit, and kickt, and scratcht, and rent,<br>
And did he wist not what in his auengement.<p>
 
And sure he was a man of mickle might,<br>
Had he had gouernance, it well to guide:<br>
But when the franticke fit inflamd his spright,<br>
His force was vaine, and strooke more often wide,<br>
Then at the aymed marke, which he had eide:<br>
And oft himselfe he chaunst to hurt vnwares,<br>
Whilst reason blent through passion, nought descride,<br>
But as a blindfold Bull at randon fares,<br>
And where he hits, nought knowes, &amp; whom he hurts, nought cares.<p>
 
His rude assault and rugged handeling<br>
Straunge seemed to the knight, that aye with foe<br>
In faire defence and goodly menaging<br>
Of armes was wont to fight, yet nathemoe<br>
Was he abashed now not fighting so,<br>
But more enfierced through his currish play,<br>
Him sternely grypt, and haling to and fro,<br>
To ouerthrow him strongly did assay,<br>
But ouerthrew himselfe vnwares, and lower lay.<p>
 
And being downe the villein sore did beat,<br>
And bruze with clownish fistes his manly face:<br>
And eke the Hag with many a bitter threat,<br>
Still cald vpon to kill him in the place.<br>
With whose reproch and odious menace<br>
The knight emboyling in his haughtie hart,<br>
Knit all his forces, and gan soone vnbrace<br>
His grasping hold: so lightly did vpstart,<br>
And drew his deadly weapon, to maintain his part.<p>
 
Which when the Palmer saw, he loudly cryde,<br>
Not so, &ocirc; <i>Guyon</i>, neuer thinke that so<br>
That Monster can be maistred or destroyd:<br>
He is not, ah, he is not such a foe,<br>
As steele can wound, or strength can ouerthroe.<br>
That same is <i>Furor</i>, cursed cruell wight,<br>
That vnto knighthood workes much shame and woe;<br>
And that same Hag, his aged mother, hight<br>
<i>Occasion</i>, the root of all wrath and despight.<p>
 
With her, who so will raging <i>Furor</i> tame,<br>
Must first begin, and well her amenage:<br>
First her restraine from her reprochfull blame,<br>
And euill meanes, with which she doth enrage<br>
Her franticke sonne, and kindles his courage,<br>
Then when she is withdrawen, or strong withstood,<br>
It's eath his idle furie to asswage,<br>
And calme the tempest of his passion wood;<br>
The bankes are ouerflowen, when stopped is the flood.<p>
 
Therewith Sir <i>Guyon</i> left his first emprise,<br>
And turning to that woman, fast her hent<br>
By the hoare lockes, that hong before her eyes,<br>
And to the ground her threw: yet n'ould she stent<br>
Her bitter rayling and foule reuilement,<br>
But still prouokt her sonne to wreake her wrong;<br>
But nathelesse he did her still torment,<br>
And catching hold of her vngratious tong,<br>
Thereon an yron lock did fasten firme and strong.<p>
 
Then when as vse of speach was from her reft,<br>
With her two crooked handes she signes did make,<br>
And beckned him, the last helpe she had left:<br>
But he that last left helpe away did take,<br>
And both her hands fast bound vnto a stake,<br>
That she note stirre. Then gan her sonne to flie<br>
Full fast away, and did her quite forsake;<br>
But <i>Guyon</i> after him in haste did hie,<br>
And soone him ouertooke in sad perplexitie.<p>
 
In his strong armes he stiffely him embraste,<br>
Who him gainstriuing, nought at all preuaild:<br>
For all his power was vtterly defaste,<br>
And furious fits at earst quite weren quaild:<br>
Oft he re'nforst, and oft his forces fayld,<br>
Yet yield he would not, nor his rancour slacke.<br>
Then him to ground he cast, and rudely hayld,<br>
And both his hands fast bound behind his backe,<br>
And both his feet in fetters to an yron racke.<p>
 
With hundred yron chaines he did him bind,<br>
And hundred knots that did him sore constraine:<br>
Yet his great yron teeth he still did grind,<br>
And grimly gnash, threatning reuenge in vaine:<br>
His burning eyen, whom bloudie strakes did staine,<br>
Stared full wide, and threw forth sparkes of fire,<br>
And more for ranck despight, then for great paine,<br>
Shakt his long lockes, colourd like copper-wire,<br>
And bit his tawny beard to shew his raging ire.<p>
 
Thus when as <i>Guyon Furor</i> had captiu'd,<br>
Turning about he saw that wretched Squire,<br>
Whom that mad man of life nigh late depriu'd,<br>
Lying on ground, all soild with bloud and mire:<br>
Whom when as he perceiued to respire,<br>
He gan to comfort, and his wounds to dresse.<br>
Being at last recured, he gan inquire,<br>
What hard mishap him brought to such distresse,<br>
And made that caitiues thral, the thral of wretchednesse.<p>
 
With hart then throbbing, and with watry eyes,<br>
Faire Sir (quoth he) what man can shun the hap,<br>
That hidden lyes vnwares him to surpryse?<br>
Misfortune waites aduantage to entrap<br>
The man most warie in her whelming lap.<br>
So me weake wretch, of many weakest one,<br>
Vnweeting, and vnware of such mishap,<br>
She brought to mischiefe through occasion,<br>
Where this same wicked villein did me light vpon.<p>
 
It was a faithlesse Squire, that was the sourse<br>
Of all my sorrow, and of these sad teares,<br>
With whom from tender dug of commune nourse,<br>
Attonce I was vpbrought, and eft when yeares<br>
More rype vs reason lent to chose our Peares,<br>
Our selues in league of vowed loue we knit:<br>
In which we long time without gealous feares,<br>
Or faultie thoughts continewd, as was fit;<br>
And for my part I vow, dissembled not a whit.<p>
 
It was my fortune commune to that age,<br>
To loue a Ladie faire of great degree,<br>
The which was borne of noble parentage,<br>
And set in highest seat of dignitee,<br>
Yet seemd no lesse to loue, then loued to bee:<br>
Long I her seru'd, and found her faithfull still,<br>
Ne euer thing could cause vs disagree:<br>
Loue that two harts makes one, makes eke one will:<br>
Each stroue to please, and others pleasure to fulfill.<p>
 
My friend, hight <i>Philemon</i>, I did partake<br>
Of all my loue and all my priuitie;<br>
Who greatly ioyous seemed for my sake,<br>
And gratious to that Ladie, as to mee,<br>
Ne euer wight, that mote so welcome bee,<br>
As he to her, withouten blot or blame,<br>
Ne euer thing, that she could thinke or see,<br>
But vnto him she would impart the same:<br>
O wretched man, that would abuse so gentle Dame.<p>
 
At last such grace I found, and meanes I wrought,<br>
That I that Ladie to my spouse had wonne;<br>
Accord of friends, consent of parents sought,<br>
Affiance made, my happinesse begonne,<br>
There wanted nought but few rites to be donne,<br>
Which mariage make; that day too farre did seeme:<br>
Most ioyous man, on whom the shining Sunne,<br>
Did shew his face, my selfe I did esteeme,<br>
And that my falser friend did no lesse ioyous deeme.<p>
 
But ere that wished day his beame disclosd,<br>
He either enuying my toward good,<br>
Or of himselfe to treason ill disposd<br>
One day vnto me came in friendly mood,<br>
And told for secret how he vnderstood<br>
That Ladie whom I had to me assynd,<br>
Had both distaind her honorable blood,<br>
And eke the faith, which she to me did bynd;<br>
And therfore wisht me stay, till I more truth should fynd.<p>
 
The gnawing anguish and sharpe gelosy,<br>
Which his sad speech infixed in my brest,<br>
Ranckled so sore, and festred inwardly,<br>
That my engreeued mind could find no rest,<br>
Till that the truth thereof I did outwrest,<br>
And him besought by that same sacred band<br>
Betwixt vs both, to counsell me the best.<br>
He then with solemne oath and plighted hand<br>
Assur'd, ere long the truth to let me vnderstand.<p>
 
Ere long with like againe he boorded mee,<br>
Saying, he now had boulted all the floure,<br>
And that it was a groome of base degree,<br>
Which of my loue was partner Paramoure:<br>
Who vsed in a darksome inner bowre<br>
Her oft to meet: which better to approue,<br>
He promised to bring me at that howre,<br>
When I should see, that would me nearer moue,<br>
And driue me to withdraw my blind abused loue.<p>
 
This gracelesse man for furtherance of his guile,<br>
Did court the handmayd of my Lady deare,<br>
Who glad t'embosome his affection vile,<br>
Did all she might, more pleasing to appeare.<br>
One day to worke her to his will more neare,<br>
He woo'd her thus: <i>Pryene</i> (so she hight)<br>
What great despight doth fortune to thee beare,<br>
Thus lowly to abase thy beautie bright,<br>
That it should not deface all others lesser light?<p>
 
But if she had her least helpe to thee lent,<br>
T'adorne thy forme according thy desart,<br>
Their blazing pride thou wouldest soone haue blent,<br>
And staynd their prayses with thy least good part;<br>
Ne should faire <i>Claribell</i> with all her art,<br>
Though she thy Lady be, approch thee neare;<br>
For proofe thereof, this euening, as thou art,<br>
Aray thy selfe in her most gorgeous geare,<br>
That I may more delight in thy embracement deare.<p>
 
The Maid&#7869; proud through prayse, and mad through loue<br>
Him hearkned to, and soone her selfe arayd,<br>
The whiles to me the treachour did remoue<br>
His craftie engin, and as he had sayd,<br>
Me leading, in a secret corner layd,<br>
The sad spectatour of my Tragedie;<br>
Where left, he went, and his owne false part playd,<br>
Disguised like that groome of base degree,<br>
Whom he had feignd th'abuser of my loue to bee.<p>
 
Eftsoones he came vnto th'appointed place,<br>
And with him brought <i>Priene</i>, rich arayd,<br>
In <i>Claribellaes</i> clothes.  Her proper face<br>
I not descerned in that darkesome shade,<br>
But weend it was my loue, with whom he playd.<br>
Ah God, what horrour and tormenting griefe<br>
My hart, my hands, mine eyes, and all assayd?<br>
Me liefer were ten thousand deathes priefe,<br>
Then wound of gealous worme, and shame of such repriefe.<p>
 
I home returning, fraught with fowle despight,<br>
And chawing vengeance all the way I went,<br>
Soone as my loathed loue appeard in sight,<br>
With wrathfull hand I slew her innocent;<br>
That after soone I dearely did lament:<br>
For when the cause of that outrageous deede<br>
Demaunded, I made plaine and euident,<br>
Her faultie Handmayd, which that bale did breede,<br>
Confest, how <i>Philemon</i> her wrought to chaunge her weede.<p>
 
Which when I heard, with horrible affright<br>
And hellish fury all enragd, I sought<br>
Vpon my selfe that vengeable despight<br>
To punish: yet it better first I thought,<br>
To wreake my wrath on him, that first it wrought.<br>
To <i>Philemon</i>, false faytour <i>Philemon</i><br>
I cast to pay, that I so dearely bought;<br>
Of deadly drugs I gaue him drinke anon,<br>
And washt away his guilt with guiltie potion.<p>
 
Thus heaping crime on crime, and griefe on griefe,<br>
To losse of loue adioyning losse of frend,<br>
I meant to purge both with a third mischiefe,<br>
And in my woes beginner it to end:<br>
That was <i>Pryene</i>; she did first offend,<br>
She last should smart: with which cruell intent,<br>
When I at her my murdrous blade did bend,<br>
She fled away with ghastly dreriment,<br>
And I pursewing my fell purpose, after went.<p>
 
Feare gaue her wings, and rage enforst my flight;<br>
Through woods and plaines so long I did her chace,<br>
Till this mad man, whom your victorious might<br>
Hath now fast bound, me met in middle space,<br>
As I her, so he me pursewd apace,<br>
And shortly ouertooke: I breathing yre,<br>
Sore chauffed at my stay in such a cace,<br>
And with my heat kindled his cruell fyre;<br>
Which kindled once, his mother did more rage inspyre.<p>
 
Betwixt them both, they haue me doen to dye,<br>
Through wounds, &amp; strokes, &amp; stubborne handeling,<br>
That death were better, then such agony,<br>
As griefe and furie vnto me did bring;<br>
Of which in me yet stickes the mortall sting,<br>
That during life will neuer be appeasd.<br>
When he thus ended had his sorrowing,<br>
Said <i>Guyon</i>, Squire, sore haue ye beene diseasd;<br>
But all your hurts may soone through t&#7869;perance be easd.<p>
 
Then gan the Palmer thus, most wretched man,<br>
That to affections does the bridle lend;<br>
In their beginning they are weake and wan,<br>
But soone through suff'rance grow to fearefull end;<br>
Whiles they are weake betimes with them contend:<br>
For when they once to perfect strength do grow,<br>
Strong warres they make, and cruell battry bend<br>
Gainst fort of Reason, it to ouerthrow:<br>
Wrath, gelosie, griefe, loue this Squire haue layd thus low.<p>
 
Wrath, gealosie, griefe, loue do thus expell:<br>
Wrath is a fire, and gealosie a weede,<br>
Griefe is a flood, and loue a monster fell;<br>
The fire of sparkes, the weede of little seede,<br>
The flood of drops, the Monster filth did breede:<br>
But sparks, seed, drops, and filth do thus delay;<br>
The sparks soone quench, the springing seed outweed,<br>
The drops dry vp, and filth wipe cleane away:<br>
So shall wrath, gealosie, griefe, loue dye and decay.<p>
 
Vnlucky Squire (said <i>Guyon</i>) sith thou hast<br>
Falne into mischiefe through intemperaunce,<br>
Henceforth take heede of that thou now hast past,<br>
And guide thy wayes with warie gouernaunce,<br>
Least worse betide thee by some later chaunce.<br>
But read how art thou nam'd, and of what kin.<br>
<i>Phedon</i> I hight (quoth he) and do aduaunce<br>
Mine auncestry from famous <i>Coradin</i>,<br>
Who first to rayse our house to honour did begin.<p>
 
Thus as he spake, lo far away they spyde<br>
A varlet running towards hastily,<br>
Whose flying feet so fast their way applyde,<br>
That round about a cloud of dust did fly,<br>
Which mingled all with sweate, did dim his eye.<br>
He soone approched, panting, breathlesse, whot,<br>
And all so soyld, that none could him descry;<br>
His countenaunce was bold, and bashed not<br>
For <i>Guyons</i> lookes, but scornefull eyglaunce at him shot.<p>
 
Behind his backe he bore a brasen shield,<br>
On which was drawen faire, in colours fit,<br>
A flaming fire in midst of bloudy field,<br>
And round about the wreath this word was writ,<br>
<i>Burnt I do burne.</i>  Right well beseemed it,<br>
To be the shield of some redoubted knight;<br>
And in his hand two darts exceeding flit,<br>
And deadly sharpe he held, whose heads were dight<br>
In poyson and in bloud, of malice and despight.<p>
 
When he in presence came, to <i>Guyon</i> first<br>
He boldly spake, Sir knight, if knight thou bee,<br>
Abandon this forestalled place at erst,<br>
For feare of further harme, I counsell thee,<br>
Or bide the chaunce at thine owne ieoperdie.<br>
The knight at his great boldnesse wondered,<br>
And though he scornd his idle vanitie,<br>
Yet mildly him to purpose answered;<br>
For not to grow of nought he it coniectured.<p>
 
Varlet, this place most dew to me I deeme,<br>
Yielded by him, that held it forcibly.<br>
But whence should come that harme, which thou doest seeme<br>
To threat to him, that minds his chaunce t'abye?<br>
Perdy (said he) here comes, and is hard by<br>
A knight of wondrous powre, and great assay,<br>
That neuer yet encountred enemy,<br>
But did him deadly daunt, or fowle dismay;<br>
Ne thou for better hope, if thou his presence stay.<p>
 
How hight he then (said <i>Guyon</i>) and from whence?<br>
<i>Pyrrhochles</i> is his name, renowmed farre<br>
For his bold feats and hardy confidence,<br>
Full oft approu'd in many a cruell warre,<br>
The brother of <i>Cymochles</i>, both which arre<br>
The sonnes of old <i>Acrates</i> and <i>Despight</i>,<br>
<i>Acrates</i> sonne of <i>Phlegeton</i> and <i>Iarre</i>;<br>
But <i>Phlegeton</i> is sonne of <i>Herebus</i> and <i>Night</i>;<br>
But <i>Herebus</i> sonne of <i>Aeternitie</i> is hight.<p>
 
So from immortall race he does proceede,<br>
That mortall hands may not withstand his might,<br>
Drad for his derring do, and bloudy deed;<br>
For all in bloud and spoile is his delight.<br>
His am I <i>Atin</i>, his in wrong and right,<br>
That matter make for him to worke vpon,<br>
And stirre him vp to strife and cruell fight.<br>
Fly therefore, fly this fearefull stead anon,<br>
Least thy foolhardize worke thy sad confusion.<p>
 
His be that care, whom most it doth concerne,<br>
(Said he) but whither with such hasty flight<br>
Art thou now bound? for well mote I discerne<br>
Great cause, that carries thee so swift and light.<br>
My Lord (quoth he) me sent, and streight behight<br>
To seeke <i>Occasion</i>, where so she bee:<br>
For he is all disposd to bloudy fight,<br>
And breathes out wrath and hainous crueltie;<br>
Hard is his hap, that first fals in his ieopardie.<p>
 
Madman (said then the Palmer) that does seeke<br>
<i>Occasion</i> to wrath, and cause of strife;<br>
She comes vnsought, and shonned followes eke.<br>
Happy, who can abstaine, when Rancour rife<br>
Kindles Reuenge, and threats his rusty knife;<br>
Woe neuer wants, where euery cause is caught,<br>
And rash <i>Occasion</i> makes vnquiet life.<br>
Then loe, where bound she sits, wh&otilde; thou hast sought,<br>
(Said <i>Guyon</i>,) let that message to thy Lord be brought.<p>
 
That when the varlet heard and saw, streight way<br>
He wexed wondrous wroth, and said, Vile knight,<br>
That knights &amp; knighthood doest with shame vpbray,<br>
And shewst th'ens&atilde;ple of thy childish might,<br>
With silly weake old woman thus to fight.<br>
Great glory and gay spoile sure hast thou got,<br>
And stoutly prou'd thy puissaunce here in sight;<br>
That shall <i>Pyrrochles</i> well requite, I wot,<br>
And with thy bloud abolish so reprochfull blot.<p>
 
With that one of his thrillant darts he threw,<br>
Headed with ire and vengeable despight;<br>
The quiuering steele his aymed end well knew,<br>
And to his brest it selfe intended right:<br>
But he was warie, and ere it empight<br>
In the meant marke, aduaunst his shield atweene,<br>
On which it seizing, no way enter might,<br>
But backe rebounding, left the forckhead keene;<br>
Eftsoones he fled away, and might no where be seene.<p>
