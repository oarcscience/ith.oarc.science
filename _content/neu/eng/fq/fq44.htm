<blockquote>
<i>The Ladies for the Girdle striue<br>
of famous Florimell:<br>
Scudamour comming to Cares house,<br>
doth sleepe from him expell.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
I
T hath bene through all ages euer seene,<br>
That with the praise of armes and cheualrie,<br>
The prize of beautie still hath ioyned beene;<br>
And that for reasons speciall priuitie:<br>
For either doth on other much relie.<br>
For he me seemes most fit the faire to serue,<br>
That can her best defend from villenie;<br>
And she most fit his seruice doth deserue,<br>
That fairest is and from her faith will neuer swerue.<p>

So fitly now here commeth next in place,<br>
After the proofe of prowesse ended well,<br>
The controuerse of beauties soueraine grace;<br>
In which to her that doth the most excell,<br>
Shall fall the girdle of faire <i>Florimell</i>:<br>
That many wish to win for glorie vaine,<br>
And not for vertuous vse, which some doe tell<br>
That glorious belt did in it selfe containe,<br>
Which Ladies ought to loue, and seeke for to obtaine.<p>

That girdle gaue the vertue of chast loue,<br>
And wiuehood true, to all that did it beare;<br>
But whosoeuer contrarie doth proue,<br>
Might not the same about her middle weare.<br>
But it would loose, or else a sunder teare.<br>
Whilome it was (as Faeries wont report)<br>
Dame <i>Venus</i> girdle, by her steemed deare,<br>
What time she vsd to liue in wiuely sort;<br>
But layd aside, when so she vsd her looser sport.<p>

Her husband <i>Vulcan</i> whylome for her sake,<br>
When first he loued her with heart entire,<br>
This pretious ornament they say did make,<br>
And wrought in <i>Lemno</i> with vnquenched fire:<br>
And afterwards did for her loues first hire,<br>
Giue it to her, for euer to remaine,<br>
Therewith to bind lasciuious desire,<br>
And loose affections streightly to restraine;<br>
Which vertue it for euer after did retaine.<p>

The same one day, when she her selfe disposd<br>
To visite her beloued Paramoure,<br>
The God of warre, she from her middle loosd,<br>
And left behind her in her secret bowre,<br>
On <i>Acidalian</i> mount, where many an howre<br>
She with the pleasant <i>Graces</i> wont to play.<br>
There <i>Florimell</i> in her first ages flowre<br>
Was fostered by those <i>Graces</i>, (as they say)<br>
And brought with her fro&tilde; thence that goodly belt away.<p>

That goodly belt was <i>Cestus</i> hight by name,<br>
And as her life by her esteemed deare.<br>
No wonder then, if that to winne the same<br>
So many Ladies sought, as shall appeare;<br>
For pearelesse she was thought, that did it beare.<br>
And now by this their feast all being ended,<br>
The iudges which thereto selected were,<br>
Into the Martian field adowne descended,<br>
To deeme this doutfull case, for which they all c&otilde;tended.<p>

But first was question made, which of those Knights<br>
That lately turneyd, had the wager wonne:<br>
There was it iudged by those worthie wights,<br>
That <i>Satyrane</i> the first day best had donne:<br>
For he last ended, hauing first begonne.<br>
The second was to <i>Triamond</i> behight,<br>
For that he sau'd the victour from fordonne:<br>
For <i>Cambell</i> victour was in all mens sight,<br>
Till by mishap he in his foemens hand did light.<p>

The third dayes prize vnto that straunger Knight,<br>
Whom all men term'd Knight of the Hebene speare,<br>
To <i>Britomart</i> was giuen by good right;<br>
For that with puissant stroke she downe did beare<br>
The <i>Saluage</i> Knight, that victour was whileare,<br>
And all the rest, which had the best afore,<br>
And to the last vnconquer'd did appeare;<br>
For last is deemed best.  To her therefore<br>
The fayrest Ladie was adiudgd for Paramore.<p>

But thereat greatly grudged <i>Arthegall</i>,<br>
And much repynd, that both of victors meede,<br>
And eke of honour she did him forestall.<br>
Yet mote he not withstand, what was decreede;<br>
But inly thought of that despightfull deede<br>
Fit time t'awaite auenged for to bee.<br>
This being ended thus, and all agreed,<br>
Then next ensew'd the Paragon to see<br>
Of beauties praise, and yeeld the fayrest her due fee.<p>

Then first <i>Cambello</i> brought vnto their view<br>
His faire <i>Cambina</i>, couered with a veale;<br>
Which being once withdrawne, most perfect hew<br>
And passing beautie did eftsoones reueale,<br>
That able was weake harts away to steale.<br>
Next did Sir <i>Triamond</i> vnto their sight<br>
The face of his deare <i>Canacee</i> vnheale;<br>
Whose beauties beame eftsoones did shine so bright,<br>
That daz'd the eyes of all, as with exceeding light.<p>

And after her did <i>Paridell</i> produce<br>
His false <i>Duessa</i>, that she might be seene;<br>
Who with her forged beautie did seduce<br>
The hearts of some, that fairest her did weene;<br>
As diuerse wits affected diuers beene.<br>
Then did Sir <i>Ferramont</i> vnto them shew<br>
His <i>Lucida</i>, that was full faire and sheene,<br>
And after these an hundred Ladies moe<br>
Appear'd in place, the which each other did outgoe.<p>

All which who so dare thinke for to enchace,<br>
Him needeth sure a golden pen I weene,<br>
To tell the feature of each goodly face.<br>
For since the day that they created beene,<br>
So many heauenly faces were not seene<br>
Assembled in one place: ne he that thought<br>
For <i>Chian</i> folke to pourtraict beauties Queene,<br>
By view of all the fairest to him brought,<br>
So many faire did see, as here he might haue sought.<p>

At last the most redoubted <i>Britonesse</i>,<br>
Her louely <i>Amoret</i> did open shew;<br>
Whose face discouered, plainely did expresse<br>
The heauenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew.<br>
Well weened all, which her that time did vew,<br>
That she should surely beare the bell away,<br>
Till <i>Blandamour</i>, who thought he had the trew<br>
And very <i>Florimell</i>, did her display:<br>
The sight of whom once seene did all the rest dismay.<p>

For all afore that seemed fayre and bright,<br>
Now base and contemptible did appeare,<br>
Compar'd to her, that shone as Phebes light,<br>
Amongst the lesser starres in euening cleare.<br>
All that her saw with wonder rauisht weare,<br>
And weend no mortall creature she should bee,<br>
But some celestiall shape, that flesh did beare:<br>
Yet all were glad there <i>Florimell</i> to see;<br>
Yet thought that <i>Florimell</i> was not so faire as shee.<p>

As guilefull Goldsmith that by secret skill,<br>
With golden foyle doth finely ouer spred<br>
Some baser metall, which commend he will<br>
Vnto the vulgar for good gold insted,<br>
He much more goodly glosse thereon doth shed,<br>
To hide his falshood, then if it were trew:<br>
So hard, this Idole was to be ared,<br>
That <i>Florimell</i> her selfe in all mens vew<br>
She seem'd to passe: so forged things do fairest shew.<p>

Then was that golden belt by doome of all<br>
Graunted to her, as to the fayrest Dame.<br>
Which being brought, about her middle small<br>
They thought to gird, as best it her became;<br>
But by no meanes they could it thereto frame.<br>
For euer as they fastned it, it loos'd<br>
And fell away, as feeling secret blame.<br>
Full oft about her wast she it enclos'd;<br>
And it as oft was from about her wast disclos'd.<p>

That all men wondred at the vncouth sight,<br>
And each one thought, as to their fancies came.<br>
But she her selfe did thinke it doen for spight,<br>
And touched was with secret wrath and shame<br>
Therewith, as thing deuiz'd her to defame.<br>
Then many other Ladies likewise tride,<br>
About their tender loynes to knit the same;<br>
But it would not on none of them abide,<br>
But when they thought it fast, eftsoones it was vntide.<p>

Which when that scornefull <i>Squire of Dames</i> did vew,<br>
He lowdly gan to laugh, and thus to iest;<br>
Alas for pittie that so faire a crew,<br>
As like can not be seene from East to West,<br>
Cannot find one this girdle to inuest.<br>
Fie on the man, that did it first inuent,<br>
To shame vs all with this, <i>Vngirt vnblest</i>.<br>
Let neuer Ladie to his loue assent,<br>
That hath this day so many so vnmanly shent.<p>

Thereat all Knights gan laugh, and Ladies lowre:<br>
Till that at last the gentle <i>Amoret</i><br>
Likewise assayd, to proue that girdles powre;<br>
And hauing it about her middle set,<br>
Did find it fit, withouten breach or let.<br>
Whereat the rest gan greatly to enuie:<br>
But <i>Florimell</i> exceedingly did fret,<br>
And snatching from her hand halfe angrily<br>
The belt againe, about her bodie gan it tie.<p>

Yet nathemore would it her bodie fit;<br>
Yet nathelesse to her, as her dew right,<br>
It yeelded was by them, that iudged it:<br>
And she her selfe adiudged to the Knight,<br>
That bore the Hebene speare, as wonne in fight.<br>
But <i>Britomart</i> would not thereto assent,<br>
Ne her owne <i>Amoret</i> forgoe so light<br>
For that strange Dame, whose beauties wonderment<br>
She lesse esteem'd, then th'others vertuous gouernment.<p>

Whom when the rest did see her to refuse,<br>
They were full glad, in hope themselues to get her:<br>
Yet at her choice they all did greatly muse.<br>
But after that the Iudges did arret her<br>
Vnto the second best, that lou'd her better;<br>
That was the <i>Saluage</i> Knight: but he was gone<br>
In great displeasure, that he could not get her.<br>
Then was she iudged <i>Triamond</i> his one;<br>
But <i>Triamond</i> lou'd <i>Canacee</i>, and other none.<p>

Tho vnto <i>Satyran</i> she was adiudged,<br>
Who was right glad to gaine so goodly meed:<br>
But <i>Blandamour</i> thereat full greatly grudged,<br>
And litle prays'd his labours euill speed,<br>
That for to winne the saddle, lost the steed.<br>
Ne lesse thereat did <i>Paridell</i> complaine,<br>
And thought t'appeale from that, which was decreed,<br>
To single combat with Sir <i>Satyrane</i>.<br>
Thereto him <i>Ate</i> stird, new discord to maintaine.<p>

And eke with these, full many other Knights<br>
She through her wicked working did incense,<br>
Her to demaund, and chalenge as their rights,<br>
Deserued for their perils recompense.<br>
Amongst the rest with boastfull vaine pretense<br>
Stept <i>Braggadochio</i> forth, and as his thrall<br>
Her claym'd, by him in battell wonne long sens:<br>
Whereto her selfe he did to witnesse call;<br>
Who being askt, accordingly confessed all.<p>

Thereat exceeding wroth was <i>Satyran</i>;<br>
And wroth with <i>Satyran</i> was <i>Blandamour</i>;<br>
And wroth with <i>Blandamour</i> was <i>Eriuan</i>;<br>
And at them both Sir <i>Paridell</i> did loure.<br>
So all together stird vp strifull stoure,<br>
And readie were new battell to darraine.<br>
Each one profest to be her paramoure,<br>
And vow'd with speare and shield it to maintaine;<br>
Ne Iudges powre, ne reasons rule mote them restraine.<p>

Which troublous stirre when <i>Satyrane</i> auiz'd:<br>
He gan to cast how to appease the same,<br>
And to accord them all, this meanes deuiz'd:<br>
First in the midst to set that fayrest Dame,<br>
To whom each one his chalenge should disclame,<br>
And he himselfe his right would eke releasse:<br>
Then looke to whom she voluntarie came,<br>
He should without disturbance her possesse:<br>
Sweete is the loue that comes alone with willingnesse.<p>

They all agreed, and then that snowy Mayd<br>
Was in the middest plast among them all;<br>
All on her gazing wisht, and vowd, and prayd,<br>
And to the Queene of beautie close did call,<br>
That she vnto their portion might befall.<br>
Then when she long had lookt vpon each one,<br>
As though she wished to haue pleasd them all,<br>
At last to <i>Braggadochio</i> selfe alone<br>
She came of her accord, in spight of all his fone.<p>

Which when they all beheld they chaft and rag'd,<br>
And woxe nigh mad for very harts despight,<br>
That from reuenge their willes they scarse asswag'd:<br>
Some thought from him her to haue reft by might;<br>
Some proffer made with him for her to fight.<br>
But he nought car'd for all that they could say:<br>
For he their words as wind esteemed light.<br>
Yet not fit place he thought it there to stay,<br>
But secretly from thence that night her bore away.<p>

They which remaynd, so soone as they perceiu'd,<br>
That she was gone, departed thence with speed,<br>
And follow'd them, in mind her to haue reau'd<br>
From wight vnworthie of so noble meed.<br>
In which poursuit how each one did succeede,<br>
Shall else be told in order, as it fell.<br>
But now of <i>Britomart</i> it here doth neede,<br>
The hard aduentures and strange haps to tell;<br>
Since with the rest she went not after <i>Florimell</i>.<p>

For soone as she them saw to discord set,<br>
Her list no longer in that place abide;<br>
But taking with her louely <i>Amoret</i>,<br>
Vpon her first aduenture forth did ride,<br>
To seeke her lou'd, making blind Loue her guide.<br>
Vnluckie Mayd to seeke her enemie!<br>
Vnluckie Mayd to seeke him farre and wide,<br>
Whom, when he was vnto her selfe most nie,<br>
She through his late disguizeme&tilde;t could him not descrie.<p>

So much the more her griefe, the more her toyle:<br>
Yet neither toyle nor griefe she once did spare,<br>
In seeking him, that should her paine assoyle;<br>
Whereto great comfort in her sad misfare<br>
Was <i>Amoret</i>, companion of her care:<br>
Who likewise sought her louer long miswent,<br>
The gentle <i>Scudamour</i>, whose hart whileare<br>
That stryfull hag with gealous discontent<br>
Had fild, that he to fell reueng was fully bent.<p>

Bent to reuenge on blamelesse <i>Britomart</i><br>
The crime, which cursed <i>Ate</i> kindled earst,<br>
The which like thornes did pricke his gealous hart,<br>
And through his soule like poysned arrow perst,<br>
That by no reason it might be reuerst,<br>
For ought that <i>Glauce</i> could or doe or say.<br>
For aye the more that she the same reherst,<br>
The more it gauld, and grieu'd him night and day,<br>
That nought but dire reuenge his anger mote defray.<p>

So as they trauelled, the drouping night<br>
Couered with cloudie storme and bitter showre,<br>
That dreadfull seem'd to euery liuing wight,<br>
Vpon them fell, before her timely howre;<br>
That forced them to seeke some couert bowre,<br>
Where they might hide their heads in quiet rest,<br>
And shrowd their persons from that stormie stowre.<br>
Not farre away, not meete for any guest<br>
They spide a little cottage, like some poore mans nest.<p>

Vnder a steepe hilles side it placed was,<br>
There where the mouldred earth had cav'd the banke;<br>
And fast beside a little brooke did pas<br>
Of muddie water, that like puddle stanke;<br>
By which few crooked sallowes grew in ranke:<br>
Whereto approaching nigh, they heard the sound<br>
Of many yron hammers beating ranke,<br>
And answering their wearie turnes around,<br>
That seemed some blacksmith dwelt in that desert grou&tilde;d.<p>

There entring in, they found the goodman selfe,<br>
Full busily vnto his worke ybent;<br>
Who was to weet a wretched wearish elfe,<br>
With hollow eyes and rawbone cheekes forspent,<br>
As if he had in prison long bene pent:<br>
Full blacke and griesly did his face appeare,<br>
Besmeard with smoke that nigh his eye-sight blent;<br>
With rugged beard, and hoarie shagged heare,<br>
The which he neuer wont to combe, or comely sheare.<p>

Rude was his garment, and to rags all rent,<br>
Ne better had he, ne for better cared:<br>
With blistred hands emongst the cinders brent,<br>
And fingers filthie, with long nayles vnpared,<br>
Right fit to rend the food, on which he fared.<br>
His name was <i>Care</i>; a blacksmith by his trade,<br>
That neither day nor night from working spared,<br>
But to small purpose yron wedges made;<br>
Those be vnquiet thoughts, that carefull minds inuade.<p>

In which his worke he had sixe seruants prest,<br>
About the Andvile standing euermore,<br>
With huge great hammers, that did neuer rest<br>
From heaping stroakes, which thereon soused sore:<br>
All sixe strong groomes, but one then other more:<br>
For by degrees they all were disagreed;<br>
So likewise did the hammers which they bore,<br>
Like belles in greatnesse orderly succeed,<br>
That he which was the last, the first did farre exceede.<p>

He like a monstrous Gyant seem'd in sight,<br>
Farre passing <i>Bronteus</i>, or <i>Pynacmon</i> great,<br>
The which in <i>Lipari</i> doe day and night<br>
Frame thunderbolts for <i>Ioues</i> auengefull threate.<br>
So dreadfully he did the anduile beat,<br>
That seem'd to dust he shortly would it driue:<br>
So huge his hammer and so fierce his heat,<br>
That seem'd a rocke of Diamond it could riue,<br>
And rend a sunder quite, if he thereto list striue.<p>

Sir <i>Scudamour</i> there entring, much admired<br>
The manner of their worke and wearie paine;<br>
And hauing long beheld, at last enquired<br>
The cause and end thereof: but all in vaine;<br>
For they for nought would from their worke refraine,<br>
Ne let his speeches come vnto their eare.<br>
And eke the breathfull bellowes blew amaine,<br>
Like to the Northren winde, that none could heare:<br>
Those <i>Pensifenesse</i> did moue; and <i>Sighes</i> the bellows weare.<p>

Which when that warriour saw, he said no more,<br>
But in his armour layd him downe to rest:<br>
To rest he layd him downe vpon the flore,<br>
(Whylome for ventrous Knights the bedding best)<br>
And thought his wearie limbs to haue redrest.<br>
And that old aged Dame, his faithfull Squire,<br>
Her feeble ioynts layd eke a downe to rest;<br>
That needed much her weake age to desire,<br>
After so long a trauell, which them both did tire.<p>

There lay Sir <i>Scudamour</i> long while expecting,<br>
When gentle sleepe his heauie eyes would close;<br>
Oft chaunging sides, and oft new place electing,<br>
Where better seem'd he mote himselfe repose;<br>
And oft in wrath he thence againe vprose;<br>
And oft in wrath he layd him downe againe.<br>
But wheresoeuer he did himselfe dispose,<br>
He by no meanes could wished ease obtaine:<br>
So euery place seem'd painefull, and ech changing vaine.<p>

And euermore, when he to sleepe did thinke,<br>
The hammers sound his senses did molest;<br>
And euermore, when he began to winke,<br>
The bellowes noyse disturb'd his quiet rest,<br>
Ne suffred sleepe to settle in his brest.<br>
And all the night the dogs did barke and howle<br>
About the house, at sent of stranger guest:<br>
And now the crowing Cocke, and now the Owle<br>
Lowde shriking him afflicted to the very sowle.<p>

And if by fortune any litle nap<br>
Vpon his heauie eye-lids chaunst to fall,<br>
Eftsoones one of those villeins him did rap<br>
Vpon his headpeece with his yron mall;<br>
That he was soone awaked therewithall,<br>
And lightly started vp as one affrayd;<br>
Or as if one him suddenly did call.<br>
So oftentimes he out of sleepe abrayd,<br>
And then lay musing long, on that him ill apayd.<p>

So long he muzed, and so long he lay,<br>
That at the last his wearie sprite opprest<br>
With fleshly weaknesse, which no creature may<br>
Long time resist, gaue place to kindly rest,<br>
That all his senses did full soone arrest:<br>
Yet in his soundest sleepe, his dayly feare<br>
His ydle braine gan busily molest,<br>
And made him dreame those two disloyall were:<br>
The things that day most minds, at night doe most appeare.<p>

With that, the wicked carle the maister Smith<br>
A paire of redwhot yron tongs did take<br>
Out of the burning cinders, and therewith<br>
Vnder his side him nipt, that forst to wake,<br>
He felt his hart for very paine to quake,<br>
And started vp auenged for to be<br>
On him, the which his quiet slomber brake:<br>
Yet looking round about him none could see;<br>
Yet did the smart remaine, though he himselfe did flee.<p>

In such disquiet and hartfretting payne,<br>
He all that night, that too long night did passe.<br>
And now the day out of the Ocean mayne<br>
Began to peepe aboue this earthly masse,<br>
With pearly dew sprinkling the morning grasse:<br>
Then vp he rose like heauie lumpe of lead,<br>
That in his face, as in a looking glasse,<br>
The signes of anguish one mote plainely read,<br>
And ghesse the man to be dismayd with gealous dread.<p>

Vnto his lofty steede he clombe anone,<br>
And forth vpon his former voiage fared,<br>
And with him eke that aged Squire attone;<br>
Who whatsoeuer perill was prepared,<br>
Both equall paines and equall perill shared:<br>
The end whereof and daungerous euent<br>
Shall for another canticle be spared.<br>
But here my wearie teeme nigh ouer spent<br>
Shall breath it selfe awhile, after so long a went.<p>
