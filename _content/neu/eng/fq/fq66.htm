I. </i> </center><p>

<blockquote>
<i>Calidore saues from Maleffort,<br>
A Damzell vsed vylde:<br>
Doth vanquish Crudor, and doth make<br>
Briana wexe more mylde.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
O
F Court it seemes, men Courtesie doe call,<br>
For that it there most vseth to abound;<br>
And well beseemeth that in Princes hall<br>
That vertue should be plentifully found,<br>
Which of all goodly manners is the ground,<br>
And roote of ciuill conuersation.<br>
Right so in Faery court it did redound,<br>
Where curteous Knights and Ladies most did won<br>
Of all on earth, and made a matchlesse paragon.<p>

But mongst them all was none more courteous Knight,<br>
Then <i>Calidore</i>, beloued ouer all,<br>
In whom it seemes, that gentlenesse of spright<br>
And manners mylde were planted naturall;<br>
To which he adding comely guize withall,<br>
And gracious speach, did steale mens hearts away.<br>
Nathlesse thereto he was full stout and tall,<br>
And well approu'd in batteilous affray,<br>
That him did much renowme, and far his fame display.<p>

Ne was there Knight, ne was there Lady found<br>
In Faery court, but him did deare embrace,<br>
For his faire vsage and conditions sound,<br>
The which in all mens liking gayned place,<br>
And with the greatest purchast greatest grace:<br>
Which he could wisely vse, and well apply,<br>
To please the best, and th'euill to embase.<br>
For he loathd leasing, and base flattery,<br>
And loued simple truth and stedfast honesty.<p>

And now he was in trauell on his way,<br>
Vppon an hard aduenture sore bestad,<br>
Whenas by chaunce he met vppon a day<br>
With <i>Artegall</i>, returning yet halfe sad<br>
From his late conquest, which he gotten had.<br>
Who whenas each of other had a sight,<br>
They knew them selues, and both their persons rad:<br>
When <i>Calidore</i> thus first; Haile noblest Knight<br>
Of all this day on ground, that breathen liuing spright.<p>

Now tell, if please you, of the good successe,<br>
Which ye haue had in your late enterprize.<br>
To whom Sir <i>Artegall</i> gan to expresse<br>
His whole exploite, and valorous emprize,<br>
In order as it did to him arize.<br>
Now happy man (sayd then Sir <i>Calidore</i>)<br>
Which haue so goodly, as ye can deuize,<br>
Atchieu'd so hard a quest, as few before;<br>
That shall you most renowmed make for euermore.<p>

But where ye ended haue, now I begin<br>
To tread an endlesse trace, withouten guyde,<br>
Or good direction, how to enter in,<br>
Or how to issue forth in waies vntryde,<br>
In perils strange, in labours long and wide;<br>
In which although good Fortune me befall,<br>
Yet shall it not by none be testifyde.<br>
What is that quest (quoth then Sir <i>Artegall</i>)<br>
That you into such perils presently doth call?<p>

The Blattant Beast (quoth he) I doe pursew,<br>
And through the world incessantly doe chase,<br>
Till I him ouertake, or else subdew:<br>
Yet know I not or how, or in what place<br>
To find him out, yet still I forward trace.<br>
What is that Blattant Beast? (then he replide)<br>
It is a Monster bred of hellishe race,<br>
(Then answerd he) which often hath annoyd<br>
Good Knights and Ladies true, and many else destroyd.<p>

Of <i>Cerberus</i> whilome he was begot,<br>
And fell <i>Chimaelig;ra</i> in her darkesome den,<br>
Through fowle commixture of his filthy blot;<br>
Where he was fostred long in <i>Stygian</i> fen,<br>
Till he to perfect ripenesse grew, and then<br>
Into this wicked world he forth was sent,<br>
To be the plague and scourge of wretched men:<br>
Whom with vile tongue and venemous intent<br>
He sore doth wound, and bite, and cruelly torment.<p>

Then since the saluage Island I did leaue<br>
Sayd <i>Artegall</i>, I such a Beast did see,<br>
The which did seeme a thousand tongues to haue,<br>
That all in spight and malice did agree,<br>
With which he bayd and loudly barkt at mee,<br>
As if that he attonce would me deuoure.<br>
But I that knew my selfe from perill free,<br>
Did nought regard his malice nor his powre,<br>
But he the more his wicked poyson forth did poure.<p>

That surely is that Beast (saide <i>Calidore</i>)<br>
Which I pursue, of whom I am right glad<br>
To heare these tidings, which of none afore<br>
Through all my weary trauell I haue had:<br>
Yet now some hope your words vnto me add.<br>
Now God you speed (quoth then Sir <i>Artegall</i>)<br>
And keepe your body from the daunger drad:<br>
For ye haue much adoe to deale withall.<br>
So both tooke goodly leaue, and parted seuerall.<p>

Sir <i>Calidore</i> thence trauelled not long,<br>
When as by chaunce a comely Squire he found,<br>
That thorough some more mighty enemies wrong,<br>
Both hand and foote vnto a tree was bound:<br>
Who seeing him from farre, with piteous sound<br>
Of his shrill cries him called to his aide.<br>
To whom approching, in that painefull stound<br>
When he him saw, for no demaunds he staide,<br>
But first him losde, and afterwards thus to him saide.<p>

Vnhappy Squire, what hard mishap thee brought<br>
Into this bay of perill and disgrace?<br>
What cruell hand thy wretched thraldome wrought,<br>
And thee captyued in this shamefull place?<br>
To whom he answerd thus; My haplesse case<br>
Is not occasiond through my misdesert,<br>
But through misfortune, which did me abase<br>
Vnto this shame, and my young hope subuert,<br>
Ere that I in her guilefull traines was well expert.<p>

Not farre from hence, vppon yond rocky hill,<br>
Hard by a streight there stands a castle strong,<br>
Which doth obserue a custome lewd and ill,<br>
And it hath long mayntaind with mighty wrong:<br>
For may no Knight nor Lady passe along<br>
That way, (and yet they needs must passe that way),<br>
By reason of the streight, and rocks among,<br>
But they that Ladies lockes doe shaue away,<br>
And that knights berd for toll, which they for passage pay.<p>

A shamefull vse as euer I did heare,<br>
Sayd <i>Calidore</i>, and to be ouerthrowne.<br>
But by what meanes did they at first it reare,<br>
And for what cause, tell if thou haue it knowne.<br>
Sayd then that Squire: The Lady which doth owne<br>
This Castle, is by name <i>Briana</i> hight.<br>
Then which a prouder Lady liueth none:<br>
She long time hath deare lou'd a doughty Knight,<br>
And sought to win his loue by all the meanes she might.<p>

His name is <i>Crudor</i>, who through high disdaine<br>
And proud despight of his selfe pleasing mynd,<br>
Refused hath to yeeld her loue againe,<br>
Vntill a Mantle she for him doe fynd,<br>
With beards of Knights and locks of Ladies lynd.<br>
Which to prouide, she hath this Castle dight,<br>
And therein hath a Seneschall assynd,<br>
Cald <i>Maleffort</i>, a man of mickle might,<br>
Who executes her wicked will, with worse despight.<p>

He this same day, as I that way did come<br>
With a faire Damzell, my beloued deare,<br>
In execution of her lawlesse doome,<br>
Did set vppon vs flying both for feare:<br>
For little bootes against him hand to reare.<br>
Me first he tooke, vnhable to withstond;<br>
And whiles he her pursued euery where,<br>
Till his returne vnto this tree he bond:<br>
Ne wote I surely, whether her he yet haue fond.<p>

Thus whiles they spake, they heard a ruefull shrieke<br>
Of one loud crying, which they streight way ghest,<br>
That it was she, the which for helpe did seeke.<br>
Tho looking vp vnto the cry to lest,<br>
They saw that Carle from farre, with hand vnblest<br>
Hayling that mayden by the yellow heare,<br>
That all her garments from her snowy brest,<br>
And from her head her lockes he nigh did teare,<br>
Ne would he spare for pitty, nor refraine for feare.<p>

Which haynous sight when <i>Calidore</i> beheld,<br>
Eftsoones he loosd that Squire, and so him left,<br>
With hearts dismay and inward dolour queld,<br>
For to pursue that villaine, which had reft<br>
That piteous spoile by so iniurious theft.<br>
Whom ouertaking, loude to him he cryde;<br>
Leaue faytor quickely that misgotten weft<br>
To him, that hath it better iustifyde,<br>
And turne thee soone to him, of whom thou art defyde.<p>

Who hearkning to that voice, him selfe vpreard,<br>
And seeing him so fiercely towardes make,<br>
Against him stoutly ran, as nought afeard,<br>
But rather more enrag'd for those words sake;<br>
And with sterne count'naunce thus vnto him spake.<br>
Art thou the caytiue, that defyest me,<br>
And for this Mayd, whose party thou doest take,<br>
Wilt giue thy beard, though it but little bee?<br>
Yet shall it not her lockes for raunsome fro me free.<p>

With that he fiercely at him flew, and layd<br>
On hideous strokes with most importune might,<br>
That oft he made him stagger as vnstayd,<br>
And oft recuile to shunne his sharpe despight.<br>
But <i>Calidore</i>, that was well skild in fight,<br>
Him long forbore, and still his spirite spar'd,<br>
Lying in waite, how him he damadge might.<br>
But when he felt him shrinke, and come to ward,<br>
He greater grew, and gan to driue at him more hard.<p>

Like as a water streame, whose swelling sourse<br>
Shall driue a Mill, within strong bancks is pent,<br>
And long restrayned of his ready course;<br>
So soone as passage is vnto him lent,<br>
Breakes forth, and makes his way more violent.<br>
Such was the fury of Sir <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
When once he felt his foeman to relent;<br>
He fiercely him pursu'd, and pressed sore,<br>
Who as he still decayd, so he encreased more.<p>

The heauy burden of whose dreadfull might<br>
When as the Carle no longer could sustaine,<br>
His heart gan faint, and streight he tooke his flight<br>
Toward the Castle, where if need constraine,<br>
His hope of refuge vsed to remaine.<br>
Whom <i>Calidore</i> perceiuing fast to flie,<br>
He him pursu'd and chaced through the plaine,<br>
That he for dread of death gan loude to crie<br>
Vnto the ward, to open to him hastilie.<p>

They from the wall him seeing so aghast,<br>
The gate soone opened to receiue him in,<br>
But <i>Calidore</i> did follow him so fast,<br>
That euen in the Porch he him did win,<br>
And cleft his head asunder to his chin.<br>
The carkasse tumbling downe within the dore,<br>
Did choke the entraunce with a lumpe of sin,<br>
That it could not be shut, whilest <i>Calidore</i><br>
Did enter in, and slew the Porter on the flore.<p>

With that the rest, the which the Castle kept,<br>
About him flockt, and hard at him did lay;<br>
But he them all from him full lightly swept,<br>
As doth a Steare, in heat of sommers day,<br>
With his long taile the bryzes brush away.<br>
Thence passing forth, into the hall he came,<br>
Where of the Lady selfe in sad dismay<br>
He was ymett, who with vncomely shame<br>
Gan him salute, and fowle vpbrayd with faulty blame.<p>

False traytor Knight, (sayd she) no Knight at all,<br>
But scorne of armes that hast with guilty hand<br>
Murdred my men, and slaine my Seneschall;<br>
Now comest thou to rob my house vnmand,<br>
And spoile my selfe, that can not thee withstand?<br>
Yet doubt thou not, but that some better Knight<br>
Then thou, that shall thy treason vnderstand,<br>
Will it auenge, and pay thee with thy right:<br>
And if none do, yet shame shal thee with shame requight.<p>

Much was the Knight abashed at that word;<br>
Yet answerd thus; Not vnto me the shame,<br>
But to the shamefull doer it afford.<br>
Bloud is no blemish; for it is no blame<br>
To punish those, that doe deserue the same;<br>
But they that breake bands of ciuilitie,<br>
And wicked customes make, those doe defame<br>
Both noble armes and gentle curtesie.<br>
No greater shame to man then inhumanitie.<p>

Then doe your selfe, for dread of shame, forgoe<br>
This euill manner, which ye here maintaine,<br>
And doe in stead thereof mild curt'sie showe<br>
To all, that passe. That shall you glory gaine<br>
More then his loue, which thus ye seeke t'obtaine.<br>
Wherewith all full of wrath, she thus replyde;<br>
Vile recreant, know that I doe much disdaine<br>
Thy courteous lore, that doest my loue deride,<br>
Who scornes thy ydle scoffe, and bids thee be defyde.<p>

To take defiaunce at a Ladies word<br>
(Quoth he) I hold it no indignity;<br>
But were he here, that would it with his sword<br>
Abett, perhaps he mote it deare aby.<br>
Cowherd (quoth she) were not, that thou wouldst fly,<br>
Ere he doe come, he should be soone in place.<br>
If I doe so, (sayd he) then liberty<br>
I leaue to you, for aye me to disgrace<br>
With all those shames, that erst ye spake me to deface.<p>

With that a Dwarfe she cald to her in hast,<br>
And taking from her hand a ring of gould,<br>
A priuy token, which betweene them past,<br>
Bad him to flie with all the speed he could,<br>
To <i>Crudor</i>, and desire him that he would<br>
Vouchsafe to reskue her against a Knight,<br>
Who through str&otilde;g powre had now her self in hould,<br>
Hauing late slaine her Seneschall in fight,<br>
And all her people murdred with outragious might.<p>

The Dwarfe his way did hast, and went all night;<br>
But <i>Calidore</i> did with her there abyde<br>
The comming of that so much threatned Knight,<br>
Where that discourteous Dame with scornfull pryde,<br>
And fowle entreaty him indignifyde,<br>
That yron heart it hardly could sustaine:<br>
Yet he, that could his wrath full wisely guyde,<br>
Did well endure her womanish disdaine,<br>
And did him selfe from fraile impatience refraine.<p>

The morrow next, before the lampe of light,<br>
Aboue the earth vpreard his flaming head,<br>
The Dwarfe, which bore that message to her knight,<br>
Brought aunswere backe, that ere he tasted bread,<br>
He would her succour, and aliue or dead<br>
Her foe deliuer vp into her hand:<br>
Therefore he wild her doe away all dread;<br>
And that of him she mote assured stand,<br>
He sent to her his basenet, as a faithfull band.<p>

Thereof full blyth the Lady streight became,<br>
And gan t'augment her bitternesse much more:<br>
Yet no whit more appalled for the same,<br>
Ne ought dismayed was Sir <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
But rather did more chearefull seeme therefore.<br>
And hauing soone his armes about him dight,<br>
Did issue forth, to meete his foe afore;<br>
Where long he stayed not, when as a Knight<br>
He spide come pricking on with al his powre and might.<p>

Well weend he streight, that he should be the same,<br>
Which tooke in hand her quarrell to maintaine;<br>
Ne stayd to aske if it were he by name,<br>
But coucht his speare, and ran at him amaine.<br>
They bene ymett in middest of the plaine,<br>
With so fell fury, and dispiteous forse,<br>
That neither could the others stroke sustaine,<br>
But rudely rowld to ground both man and horse,<br>
Neither of other taking pitty nor remorse.<p>

But <i>Calidore</i> vprose againe full light,<br>
Whiles yet his foe lay fast in sencelesse sound,<br>
Yet would he not him hurt, although he might:<br>
For shame he weend a sleeping wight to wound.<br>
But when <i>Briana</i> saw that drery stound,<br>
There where she stood vppon the Castle wall,<br>
She deem'd him sure to haue bene dead on ground,<br>
And made such piteous mourning therewithall,<br>
That from the battlements she ready seem'd to fall.<p>

Nathlesse at length him selfe he did vpreare<br>
In lustlesse wise, as if against his will,<br>
Ere he had slept his fill, he wakened were,<br>
And gan to stretch his limbs; which feeling ill<br>
Of his late fall, a while he rested still:<br>
But when he saw his foe before in vew,<br>
He shooke off luskishnesse, and courage chill<br>
Kindling a fresh, gan battell to renew,<br>
To proue if better foote then horsebacke would ensew.<p>

There then began a fearefull cruell fray<br>
Betwixt them two, for maystery of might.<br>
For both were wondrous practicke in that play,<br>
And passing well expert in single fight,<br>
And both inflam'd with furious despight:<br>
Which as it still encreast, so still increast<br>
Their cruell strokes and terrible affright;<br>
Ne once for ruth their rigour they releast,<br>
Ne once to breath a while their angers tempest ceast.<p>

Thus long they trac'd and trauerst to and fro,<br>
And tryde all waies, how each mote entrance make<br>
Into the life of his malignant foe;<br>
They hew'd their helmes, and plates asunder brake,<br>
As they had potshares bene; for nought mote slake<br>
Their greedy vengeaunces, but goary blood,<br>
That at the last like to a purple lake<br>
Of bloudy gore congeal'd about them stood,<br>
Which from their riuen sides forth gushed like a flood.<p>

At length it chaunst, that both their hands on hie,<br>
At once did heaue, with all their powre and might,<br>
Thinking the vtmost of their force to trie,<br>
And proue the finall fortune of the fight:<br>
But <i>Calidore</i>, that was more quicke of sight,<br>
And nimbler handed, then his enemie,<br>
Preuented him before his stroke could light,<br>
And on the helmet smote him formerlie,<br>
That made him stoupe to ground with meeke humilitie.<p>

And ere he could recouer foot againe,<br>
He following that faire aduantage fast,<br>
His stroke redoubled with such might and maine,<br>
That him vpon the ground he groueling cast;<br>
And leaping to him light, would haue vnlast<br>
His Helme, to make vnto his vengeance way.<br>
Who seeing, in what daunger he was plast,<br>
Cryde out, Ah mercie Sir, doe me not slay,<br>
But saue my life, which lot before your foot doth lay.<p>

With that his mortall hand a while he stayd,<br>
And hauing somewhat calm'd his wrathfull heat<br>
With goodly patience, thus he to him sayd;<br>
And is the boast of that proud Ladies threat,<br>
That menaced me from the field to beat,<br>
Now brought to this? By this now may ye learne,<br>
Strangers no more so rudely to intreat,<br>
But put away proud looke, and vsage sterne,<br>
The which shal nought to you but foule dishonor yearne.<p>

For nothing is more blamefull to a knight,<br>
That court'sie doth as well as armes professe,<br>
How euer strong and fortunate in fight,<br>
Then the reproch of pride and cruelnesse.<br>
In vaine he seeketh others to suppresse,<br>
Who hath not learnd him selfe first to subdew:<br>
All flesh is frayle, and full of ficklenesse,<br>
Subiect to fortunes chance, still chaunging new;<br>
What haps to day to me, to morrow may to you.<p>

Who will not mercie vnto others shew,<br>
How can he mercy euer hope to haue?<br>
To pay each with his owne is right and dew.<br>
Yet since ye mercie now doe need to craue,<br>
I will it graunt, your hopelesse life to saue;<br>
With these conditions, which I will propound:<br>
First, that ye better shall your selfe behaue<br>
Vnto all errant knights, whereso on ground;<br>
Next that ye Ladies ayde in euery stead and stound.<p>

The wretched man, that all this while did dwell<br>
In dread of death, his heasts did gladly heare,<br>
And promist to performe his precept well,<br>
And whatsoeuer else he would requere.<br>
So suffring him to rise, he made him sweare<br>
By his owne sword, and by the crosse thereon,<br>
To take <i>Briana</i> for his louing fere,<br>
Withouten dowre or composition;<br>
But to release his former foule condition.<p>

All which accepting, and with faithfull oth<br>
Bynding himselfe most firmely to obay,<br>
He vp arose, how euer liefe or loth,<br>
And swore to him true fealtie for aye.<br>
Then forth he cald from sorrowfull dismay<br>
The sad <i>Briana</i>, which all this beheld:<br>
Who comming forth yet full of late affray,<br>
Sir <i>Calidore</i> vpcheard, and to her teld<br>
All this accord, to which he <i>Crudor</i> had compeld.<p>

Whereof she now more glad, then sory earst,<br>
All ouercome with infinite affect,<br>
For his exceeding courtesie, that pearst<br>
Her stubborne hart with inward deepe effect,<br>
Before his feet her selfe she did proiect,<br>
And him adoring as her liues deare Lord,<br>
With all due thankes, and dutifull respect,<br>
Her selfe acknowledg'd bound for that accord,<br>
By which he had to her both life and loue restord.<p>

So all returning to the Castle glad,<br>
Most ioyfully she them did entertaine,<br>
Where goodly glee and feast to them she made,<br>
To shew her thankefull mind and meaning faine,<br>
By all the meanes she mote it best explaine:<br>
And after all, vnto Sir <i>Calidore</i><br>
She freely gaue that Castle for his paine,<br>
And her selfe bound to him for euermore;<br>
So wondrously now chaung'd, from that she was afore.<p>

But <i>Calidore</i> himselfe would not retaine<br>
Nor land nor fee, for hyre of his good deede,<br>
But gaue them streight vnto that Squire againe,<br>
Whom from her Seneschall he lately freed,<br>
And to his damzell as their rightfull meed,<br>
For recompence of all their former wrong:<br>
There he remaind with them right well agreed,<br>
Till of his wounds he wexed hole and strong,<br>
And then to his first quest he passed forth along.<p>
