*Cant. XII.*

> *Guyon, by Palmers gouernance,  
> passing through perils great,  
> Doth ouerthrow the Bowre of blisse,  
> and Acrasie defeat.*

> N Ow gins this goodly frame of Temperance  
> Fairely to rise, and her adorned hed  
> To pricke of highest praise forth to aduance,  
> Formerly grounded, and fast setteled  
> On firme foundation of true bountihed;  
> And this braue knight, that for that vertue fights,  
> Now comes to point of that same perilous sted,  
> Where Pleasure dwelles in sensuall delights,  
> Mõgst thousand dangers, & ten thousand magick mights.
>
> Two dayes now in that sea he sayled has,  
> Ne euer land beheld, ne liuing wight,  
> Ne ought saue perill, still as he did pas:  
> Tho when appeared the third *Morrow* bright,  
> Vpon the waues to spred her trembling light,  
> An hideous roaring farre away they heard,  
> That all their senses filled with affright,  
> And streight they saw the raging surges reard  
> Vp to the skyes, that them of drowning made affeard.
>
> Said then the Boteman, Palmer stere aright,  
> And keepe an euen course; for yonder way  
> We needes must passe (God do vs well acquight,)  
> That is the *Gulfe of Greedinesse*, they say,  
> That deepe engorgeth all this worldes pray:  
> Which hauing swallowd vp excessiuely,  
> He soone in vomit vp againe doth lay,  
> And belcheth forth his superfluity,  
> That all the seas for feare do seeme away to fly.
>
> On th'other side an hideous Rocke is pight,  
> Of mightie *Magnes* stone, whose craggie clift  
> Depending from on high, dreadfull to sight,  
> Ouer the waues his rugged armes doth lift,  
> And threatneth downe to throw his ragged rift  
> On who so commeth nigh; yet nigh it drawes  
> All passengers, that none from it can shift:  
> For whiles they fly that Gulfes deuouring iawes,  
> They on this rock are rent, and sunck in helplesse wawes.
>
> Forward they passe, and strongly he them rowes,  
> Vntill they nigh vnto that Gulfe arriue,  
> Where streame more violent and greedy growes:  
> Then he with all his puissance doth striue  
> To strike his oares, and mightily doth driue  
> The hollow vessell through the threatfull waue,  
> Which gaping wide, to swallow them aliue,  
> In th'huge abysse of his engulfing graue,  
> Doth rore at them in vaine, and with great terror raue.
>
> They passing by, that griesly mouth did see,  
> Sucking the seas into his entralles deepe,  
> That seem'd more horrible then hell to bee,  
> Or that darke dreadfull hole of *Tartare* steepe,  
> Through which the damned ghosts doen often creepe  
> Backe to the world, bad liuers to torment:  
> But nought that falles into this direfull deepe,  
> Ne that approcheth nigh the wide descent,  
> May backe returne, but is condemned to be drent.
>
> On th'other side, they saw that perilous Rocke,  
> Threatning it selfe on them to ruinate,  
> On whose sharpe clifts the ribs of vessels broke,  
> And shiuered ships, which had bene wrecked late,  
> Yet stuck, with carkasses exanimate  
> Of such, as hauing all their substance spent  
> In wanton ioyes, and lustes intemperate,  
> Did afterwards make shipwracke violent,  
> Both of their life, and fame for euer fowly blent.
>
> For thy, this hight *The Rocke of* vile *Reproch*,  
> A daungerous and detestable place,  
> To which nor fish nor fowle did once approch,  
> But yelling Meawes, with Seagulles hoarse and bace,  
> And Cormoyrants, with birds of rauenous race,  
> Which still sate waiting on that wastfull clift,  
> For spoyle of wretches, whose vnhappie cace,  
> After lost credite and consumed thrift,  
> At last them driuen hath to this despairefull drift.
>
> The Palmer seeing them in safetie past,  
> Thus said; Behold th'ensamples in our sights,  
> Of lustfull luxurie and thriftlesse wast:  
> What now is left of miserable wights,  
> Which spent their looser daies in lewd delights,  
> But shame and sad reproch, here to be red,  
> By these rent reliques, speaking their ill plights?  
> Let all that liue, hereby be counselled,  
> To shunne *Rocke of Reproch*, and it as death to dred.
>
> So forth they rowed, and that *Ferryman*  
> With his stiffe oares did brush the sea so strong,  
> That the hoare waters from his frigot ran,  
> And the light bubbles daunced all along,  
> Whiles the salt brine out of the billowes sprong.  
> At last farre off they many Islands spy,  
> On euery side floting the floods emong:  
> Then said the knight, Loe I the land descry,  
> Therefore old Syre thy course do thereunto apply.
>
> That may not be, said then the *Ferryman*  
> Least we vnweeting hap to be fordonne:  
> For those same Islands, seeming now and than,  
> Are not firme land, nor any certein wonne,  
> But straggling plots, which to and fro do ronne  
> In the wide waters: therefore are they hight  
> The *wandring Islands*. Therefore doe them shonne;  
> For they haue oft drawne many a wandring wight  
> Into most deadly daunger and distressed plight.
>
> Yet well they seeme to him, that farre doth vew,  
> Both faire and fruitfull, and the ground dispred  
> With grassie greene of delectable hew,  
> And the tall trees with leaues apparelled,  
> Are deckt with blossomes dyde in white and red,  
> That mote the passengers thereto allure;  
> But whosoeuer once hath fastened  
> His foot thereon, may neuer it recure,  
> But wandreth euer more vncertein and vnsure.
>
> As th'Isle of *Delos* whylome men report  
> Amid th'*Aegæan* sea long time did stray,  
> Ne made for shipping any certaine port,  
> Till that *Latona* traueiling that way,  
> Flying from *Iunoes* wrath and hard assay,  
> Of her faire twins was there deliuered,  
> Which afterwards did rule the night and day;  
> Thenceforth it firmely was established,  
> And for *Apolloes* honor highly herried.
>
> They to him hearken, as beseemeth meete,  
> And passe on forward: so their way does ly,  
> That one of those same Islands, which doe fleet  
> In the wide sea, they needes must passen by,  
> Which seemd so sweet and pleasant to the eye,  
> That it would tempt a man to touchen there:  
> Vpon the banck they sitting did espy  
> A daintie damzell, dressing of her heare,  
> By whom a litle skippet floting did appeare.
>
> She them espying, loud to them can call,  
> Bidding them nigher draw vnto the shore;  
> For she had cause to busie them withall;  
> And therewith loudly laught: But nathemore  
> Would they once turne, but kept on as afore:  
> Which when she saw, she left her lockes vndight,  
> And running to her boat withouten ore,  
> From the departing land it launched light,  
> And after them did driue with all her power and might.
>
> Whom ouertaking, she in merry sort  
> Them gan to bord, and purpose diuersly,  
> Now faining dalliance and wanton sport,  
> Now throwing forth lewd words immodestly;  
> Till that the Palmer gan full bitterly  
> Her to rebuke, for being loose and light:  
> Which not abiding, but more scornefully  
> Scoffing at him, that did her iustly wite,  
> She turnd her bote about, and from them rowed quite.
>
> That was the wanton *Phoedria*, which late  
> Did ferry him ouer the *Idle lake*:  
> Whom nought regarding, they kept on their gate,  
> And all her vaine allurements did forsake,  
> When them the wary Boateman thus bespake;  
> Here now behoueth vs well to auyse,  
> And of our safetie good heede to take;  
> For here before a perlous passage lyes,  
> Where many Mermayds haunt, making false melodies.
>
> But by the way, there is a great Quicksand,  
> And a whirlepoole of hidden ieopardy,  
> Therefore, Sir Palmer, keepe an euen hand;  
> For twixt them both the narrow way doth ly.  
> Scarse had he said, when hard at hand they spy  
> That quicksand nigh with water couered;  
> But by the checked waue they did descry  
> It plaine, and by the sea discoloured:  
> It called was the quicksand of *Vnthriftyhed*.
>
> They passing by, a goodly Ship did see,  
> Laden from far with precious merchandize,  
> And brauely furnished, as ship might bee,  
> Which through great disauenture, or mesprize,  
> Her selfe had runne into that hazardize;  
> Whose mariners and merchants with much toyle,  
> Labour'd in vaine, to haue recur'd their prize,  
> And the rich wares to saue from pitteous spoyle,  
> But neither toyle nor trauell might her backe recoyle.
>
> On th'other side they see that perilous Poole,  
> That called was the *VVhirlepoole of decay*,  
> In which full many had with haplesse doole  
> Beene suncke, of whom no memorie did stay:  
> Whose circled waters rapt with whirling sway,  
> Like to a restlesse wheele, still running round,  
> Did couet, as they passed by that way,  
> To draw their boate within the vtmost bound  
> Of his wide *Labyrinth*, and then to haue them dround.
>
> But th'heedfull Boateman strongly forth did stretch  
> His brawnie armes, and all his body straine,  
> That th'vtmost sandy breach they shortly fetch,  
> Whiles the dred daunger does behind remaine.  
> Suddeine they see from midst of all the Maine,  
> The surging waters like a mountaine rise,  
> And the great sea puft vp with proud disdaine,  
> To swell aboue the measure of his guise,  
> As threatning to deuoure all, that his powre despise.
>
> The waues come rolling, and the billowes rore  
> Outragiously, as they enraged were,  
> Or wrathfull *Neptune* did them driue before  
> His whirling charet, for exceeding feare:  
> For not one puffe of wind there did appeare,  
> That all the three thereat woxe much afrayd,  
> Vnweeting, what such horrour straunge did reare.  
> Eftsoones they saw an hideous hoast arrayd,  
> Of huge Sea monsters, such as liuing sence dismayd.
>
> Most vgly shapes, and horrible aspects,  
> Such as Dame Nature selfe mote feare to see,  
> Or shame, that euer should so fowle defects  
> From her most cunning hand escaped bee;  
> All dreadfull pourtraicts of deformitee:  
> Spring-headed *Hydraes*, and sea-shouldring Whales,  
> Great whirlpooles, which all fishes make to flee,  
> Bright Scolopendraes, arm'd with siluer scales,  
> Mighty *Monoceroses*, with immeasured tayles.
>
> The dreadfull Fish, that hath deseru'd the name  
> Of Death, and like him lookes in dreadfull hew,  
> The griesly Wasserman, that makes his game  
> The flying ships with swiftnesse to pursew,  
> The horrible Sea-satyre, that doth shew  
> His fearefull face in time of greatest storme,  
> Huge *Ziffius*, whom Mariners eschew  
> No lesse, then rockes, (as trauellers informe,)  
> And greedy *Rosmarines* with visages deforme.
>
> All these, and thousand thousands many more,  
> And more deformed Monsters thousand fold,  
> With dreadfull noise, and hollow rombling rore,  
> Came rushing in the fomy waues enrold,  
> Which seem'd to fly for feare, them to behold:  
> Ne wonder, if these did the knight appall;  
> For all that here on earth we dreadfull hold,  
> Be but as bugs to fearen babes withall,  
> Compared to the creatures in the seas entrall.
>
> Feare nought, (then said the Palmer well auiz'd;)  
> For these same Monsters are not these in deed,  
> But are into these fearefull shapes disguiz'd  
> By that same wicked witch, to worke vs dreed,  
> And draw from on this iourney to proceede.  
> Tho lifting vp his vertuous staffe on hye,  
> He smote the sea, which calmed was with speed,  
> And all that dreadfull Armie fast gan flye  
> Into great *Tethys* bosome, where they hidden lye.
>
> Quit from that daunger, forth their course they kept,  
> And as they went, they heard a ruefull cry  
> Of one, that wayld and pittifull\[y\] wept,  
> That through the sea the resounding plaints did fly:  
> At last they in an Island did espy  
> A seemely Maiden, sitting by the shore,  
> That with great sorrow and sad agony,  
> Seemed some great misfortune to deplore,  
> And lowd to them for succour called euermore.
>
> Which *Guyon* hearing, streight his Palmer bad,  
> To stere the boate towards that dolefull Mayd,  
> That he might know, and ease her sorrow sad:  
> Who him auizing better, to him sayd;  
> Faire Sir, be not displeasd, if disobayd:  
> For ill it were to hearken to her cry;  
> For she is inly nothing ill apayd,  
> But onely womanish fine forgery,  
> Your stubborne hart t'affect with fraile infirmity.
>
> To which when she your courage hath inclind  
> Through foolish pitty, then her guilefull bayt  
> She will embosome deeper in your mind,  
> And for your ruine at the last awayt.  
> The knight was ruled, and the Boateman strayt  
> Held on his course with stayed stedfastnesse,  
> Ne euer shruncke, ne euer sought to bayt  
> His tyred armes for toylesome wearinesse,  
> But with his oares did sweepe the watry wildernesse.
>
> And now they nigh approched to the sted,  
> Where as those Mermayds dwelt: it was a still  
> And calmy bay, on th'one side sheltered  
> With the brode shadow of an hoarie hill,  
> On th'other side an high rocke toured still,  
> That twixt them both a pleasaunt port they made,  
> And did like an halfe Theatre fulfill:  
> There those fiue sisters had continuall trade,  
> And vsd to bath themselues in that deceiptfull shade.
>
> They were faire Ladies, till they fondly striu'd  
> With th'*Heliconian* maides for maistery;  
> Of whom they ouer-comen, were depriu'd  
> Of their proud beautie, and th'one moyity  
> Transform'd to fish, for their bold surquedry,  
> But th'vpper halfe their hew retained still,  
> And their sweet skill in wonted melody;  
> Which euer after they abusd to ill,  
> T'allure weake trauellers, whom gotten they did kill.
>
> So now to *Guyon*, as he passed by,  
> Their pleasaunt tunes they sweetly thus applide;  
> O thou faire sonne of gentle Faery,  
> That art in mighty armes most magnifide  
> Aboue all knights, that euer battell tride,  
> O turne thy rudder hither-ward a while:  
> Here may thy storme-bet vessell safely ride;  
> This is the Port of rest from troublous toyle,  
> The worlds sweet In, from paine & wearisome turmoyle.
>
> With that the rolling sea resounding soft,  
> In his big base them fitly answered,  
> And on the rocke the waues breaking aloft,  
> A solemne Meane vnto them measured,  
> The whiles sweet *Zephirus* lowd whisteled  
> His treble, a straunge kinde of harmony;  
> Which *Guyons* senses softly tickeled,  
> That he the boateman bad row easily,  
> And let him heare some part of their rare melody.
>
> But him the Palmer from that vanity,  
> With temperate aduice discounselled,  
> That they it past, and shortly gan descry  
> The land, to which their course they leueled;  
> When suddeinly a grosse fog ouer spred  
> With his dull vapour all that desert has,  
> And heauens chearefull face enueloped,  
> That all things one, and one as nothing was,  
> And this great Vniuerse seemd one confused mas.
>
> Thereat they greatly were dismayd, ne wist  
> How to direct their way in darkenesse wide,  
> But feard to wander in that wastfull mist,  
> For tombling into mischiefe vnespide.  
> Worse is the daunger hidden, then descride.  
> Suddeinly an innumerable flight  
> Of harmefull fowles about them fluttering, cride,  
> And with their wicked wings them oft did smight,  
> And sore annoyed, groping in that griesly night.
>
> Euen all the nation of vnfortunate  
> And fatall birds about them flocked were,  
> Such as by nature men abhorre and hate,  
> The ill-faste Owle, deaths dreadfull messengere,  
> The hoars Night-rauen, trump of dolefull drere,  
> The lether-winged Bat, dayes enimy,  
> The ruefull Strich, still waiting on the bere,  
> The Whistler shrill, that who so heares, doth dy,  
> The hellish Harpies, prophets of sad destiny.
>
> All those, and all that else does horrour breed,  
> About them flew, and fild their sayles with feare:  
> Yet stayd they not, but forward did proceed,  
> Whiles th'one did row, and th'other stifly steare;  
> Till that at last the weather gan to cleare,  
> And the faire land it selfe did plainly show.  
> Said then the Palmer, Lo where does appeare  
> The sacred soile, where all our perils grow;  
> Therefore, Sir knight, your ready armes about you throw.
>
> He hearkned, and his armes about him tooke,  
> The whiles the nimble boate so well her sped,  
> That with her crooked keele the land she strooke,  
> Then forth the noble *Guyon* sallied,  
> And his sage Palmer, that him gouerned;  
> But th'other by his boate behind did stay.  
> They marched fairly forth, of nought ydred,  
> Both firmely armd for euery hard assay,  
> With constancy and care, gainst daunger and dismay.
>
> Ere long they heard an hideous bellowing  
> Of many beasts, that roard outrageously,  
> As if that hungers point, or *Venus* sting  
> Had them enraged with fell surquedry;  
> Yet nought they feard, but past on hardily,  
> Vntill they came in vew of those wild beasts:  
> Who all attonce, gaping full greedily,  
> And rearing fiercely their vpstarting crests,  
> Ran towards, to deuoure those vnexpected guests.
>
> But soone as they approcht with deadly threat,  
> The Palmer ouer them his staffe vpheld,  
> His mighty staffe, that could all charmes defeat:  
> Eftsoones their stubborne courages were queld,  
> And high aduaunced crests downe meekely feld,  
> In stead of fraying, they them selues did feare,  
> And trembled, as them passing they beheld:  
> Such wondrous powre did in that staffe appeare,  
> All monsters to subdew to him, that did it beare.
>
> Of that same wood it fram'd was cunningly,  
> Of which *Caduceus* whilome was made,  
> *Caduceus* the rod of *Mercury*,  
> With which he wonts the *Stygian* realmes inuade,  
> Through ghastly horrour, and eternall shade;  
> Th'infernall feends with it he can asswage,  
> And *Orcus* tame, whom nothing can perswade,  
> And rule the *Furyes*, when they most do rage:  
> Such vertue in his staffe had eke this Palmer sage.
>
> Thence passing forth, they shortly do arriue,  
> Whereas the Bowre of *Blisse* was situate;  
> A place pickt out by choice of best aliue,  
> That natures worke by art can imitate:  
> In which what euer in this worldly state  
> Is sweet, and pleasing vnto liuing sense,  
> Or that may dayntiest fantasie aggrate,  
> Was poured forth with plentifull dispence,  
> And made there to abound with lauish affluence.
>
> Goodly it was enclosed round about,  
> Aswell their entred guestes to keepe within,  
> As those vnruly beasts to hold without;  
> Yet was the fence thereof but weake and thin;  
> Nought feard their force, that fortilage to win,  
> But wisedomes powre, and temperaunces might,  
> By which the mightiest things efforced bin:  
> And eke the gate was wrought of substaunce light,  
> Rather for pleasure, then for battery or fight.
>
> Yt framed was of precious yuory,  
> That seemd a worke of admirable wit;  
> And therein all the famous history  
> Of *Iason* and *Medæa* was ywrit;  
> Her mighty charmes, her furious louing fit,  
> His goodly conquest of the golden fleece,  
> His falsed faith, and loue too lightly flit,  
> The wondred *Argo*, which in venturous peece  
> First through the *Euxine* seas bore all the flowr of *Greece*.
>
> Ye might haue seene the frothy billowes fry  
> Vnder the ship, as thorough them she went,  
> That seemd the waues were into yuory,  
> Or yuory into the waues were sent;  
> And other where the snowy substaunce sprent  
> With vermell, like the boyes bloud therein shed,  
> A piteous spectacle did represent,  
> And otherwhiles with gold besprinkeled;  
> Yt seemd th'enchaunted flame, which did *Creüsa* wed.
>
> All this, and more might in that goodly gate  
> Be red; that euer open stood to all,  
> Which thither came: but in the Porch there sate  
> A comely personage of stature tall,  
> And semblaunce pleasing, more then naturall,  
> That trauellers to him seemd to entize;  
> His looser garment to the ground did fall,  
> And flew about his heeles in wanton wize,  
> Not fit for speedy pace, or manly exercize.
>
> They in that place him *Genius* did call:  
> Not that celestiall powre, to whom the care  
> Of life, and generation of all  
> That liues, pertaines in charge particulare,  
> Who wondrous things concerning our welfare,  
> And straunge phantomes doth let vs oft forsee,  
> And oft of secret ill bids vs beware:  
> That is our Selfe, whom though we do not see,  
> Yet each doth in him selfe it well perceiue to bee.
>
> Therefore a God him sage Antiquity  
> Did wisely make, and good *Agdistes* call:  
> But this same was to that quite contrary,  
> The foe of life, that good enuyes to all,  
> That secretly doth vs procure to fall,  
> Through guilefull semblaunts, which he makes vs see.  
> He of this Gardin had the gouernall,  
> And Pleasures porter was deuizd to bee,  
> Holding a staffe in hand for more formalitee.
>
> With diuerse flowres he daintily was deckt,  
> And strowed round about, and by his side  
> A mighty Mazer bowle of wine was set,  
> As if it had to him bene sacrifide;  
> Wherewith all new-come guests he gratifide:  
> So did he eke Sir *Guyon* passing by:  
> But he his idle curtesie defide,  
> And ouerthrew his bowle disdainfully;  
> And broke his staffe, with which he charmed semblants sly.
>
> Thus being entred, they behold around  
> A large and spacious plaine, on euery side  
> Strowed with pleasauns, whose faire grassy ground  
> Mantled with greene, and goodly beautifide  
> With all the ornaments of *Floraes* pride,  
> Wherewith her mother Art, as halfe in scorne  
> Of niggard Nature, like a pompous bride  
> Did decke her, and too lauishly adorne,  
> When forth from virgin bowre she comes in th'early morne.
>
> Thereto the Heauens alwayes Iouiall,  
> Lookt on them louely, still in stedfast state,  
> Ne suffred storme nor frost on them to fall,  
> Their tender buds or leaues to violate,  
> Nor scorching heat, nor cold intemperate  
> T'afflict the creatures, which therein did dwell,  
> But the milde air with season moderate  
> Gently attempred, and disposd so well,  
> That still it breathed forth sweet spirit & holesome smell.
>
> More sweet and holesome, then the pleasaunt hill  
> Of *Rhodope*, on which the Nimphe, that bore  
> A gyaunt babe, her selfe for griefe did kill;  
> Or the Thessalian *Tempe*, where of yore  
> Faire *Daphne Phoebus* hart with loue did gore;  
> Or *Ida*, where the Gods lou'd to repaire,  
> When euer they their heauenly bowres forlore;  
> Or sweet *Parnasse*, the haunt of Muses faire;  
> Or *Eden* selfe, if ought with *Eden* mote compaire.
>
> Much wondred *Guyon* at the faire aspect  
> Of that sweet place, yet suffred no delight  
> To sincke into his sence, nor mind affect,  
> But passed forth, and lookt still forward right,  
> Bridling his will, and maistering his might:  
> Till that he came vnto another gate,  
> No gate, but like one, being goodly dight  
> With boughes and braunches, which did broad dilate  
> Their clasping armes, in wanton wreathings intricate.
>
> So fashioned a Porch with rare deuice,  
> Archt ouer head with an embracing vine,  
> Whose bounches hanging downe, seemed to entice  
> All passers by, to tast their lushious wine,  
> And did themselues into their hands incline,  
> As freely offering to be gathered:  
> Some deepe empurpled as the *Hyacint*,  
> Some as the Rubine, laughing sweetly red,  
> Some like faire Emeraudes, not yet well ripened.
>
> And them amongst, some were of burnisht gold,  
> So made by art, to beautifie the rest,  
> Which did themselues emongst the leaues enfold,

> In her left hand a Cup of gold she held,

> Thereof she vsd to giue to drinke to each,  
> Whom passing by she happened to meet:

> So she to *Guyon* offred it to tast;

> There the most daintie Paradise on ground,  
> It selfe doth offer to his sober eye,  
> In which all pleasures plenteously abound,  
> And none does others happinesse enuye:  
> The painted flowres, the trees vpshooting hye,  
> The dales for shade, the hilles for breathing space,  
> The trembling groues, the Christall running by;  
> And that, which all faire workes doth most aggrace,  
> The art, which all that wrought, appeared in no place.
>
> One would haue thought, (so cunningly, the rude,

> That nature had for wantonesse ensude  
> Art, and that Art at nature did repine;  
> So striuing each th'other to vndermine,

>
> And in the midst of all, a fountaine stood,

> And ouer all, of purest gold was spred,  
> A trayle of yuie in his natiue hew:

> Low his lasciuious armes adown did creepe,  
> That themselues dipping in the siluer dew,  
> Their fleecy flowres they tenderly did steepe,  
> Which drops of Christall seemd for wantones to weepe.
>
> Infinit streames continually did well  
> Out of this fountaine, sweet and faire to see,  
> The which into an ample lauer fell,  
> And shortly grew to so great quantitie,  
> That like a little lake it seemd to bee;  
> Whose depth exceeded not three cubits hight,  
> That through the waues one might the bottom see,  
> All pau'd beneath with Iaspar shining bright,  
> That seemd the fountaine in that sea did sayle vpright.
>
> And all the margent round about was set,  
> With shady Laurell trees, thence to defend  
> The sunny beames, which on the billowes bet,  
> And those which therein bathed, mote offend.  
> As *Guyon* hapned by the same to wend,  
> Two naked Damzelles he therein espyde,  
> Which therein bathing, seemed to contend,

> Or as the *Cyprian* goddesse, newly borne  
> Of th'Oceans fruitfull froth, did first appeare:  
> Such seemed they, and so their yellow heare  
> Christalline humour dropped downe apace.  
> Whom such when *Guyon* saw, he drew him neare,  
> And somewhat gan relent his earnest pace,  
> His stubborne brest gan secret pleasaunce to embrace.
>
> The wanton Maidens him espying, stood  
> Gazing a while at his vnwonted guise;  
> Then th'one her selfe low ducked in the flood,  
> Abasht, that her a straunger did avise:

>
> With that, the other likewise vp arose,  
> And her faire lockes, which formerly were bownd  
> Vp in one knot, he low adowne did lose:

> Yet that, which reft it, no lesse faire was fownd:  
> So hid in lockes and waues from lookers theft,  
> Nought but her louely face she for his looking left.
>
> Withall she laughed, and she blusht withall,  
> That blushing to her laughter gaue more grace,  
> And laughter to her blushing, as did fall:  
> Now when they spide the knight to slacke his pace,  
> Them to behold, and in his sparkling face  
> The secret signes of kindled lust appeare,  
> Their wanton meriments they did encreace,  
> And to him beckned, to approch more neare,  
> And shewd him many sights, that courage cold could reare.
>
> On which when gazing him the Palmer saw,  
> He much rebukt those wandring eyes of his,  
> And counseld well, him forward thence did draw.  
> Now are they come nigh to the *Bowre of blis*  
> Of her fond fauorites so nam'd amis:  
> When thus the Palmer; Now Sir, well auise;  
> For here the end of all our trauell is:  
> Here wonnes *Acrasia*, whom we must surprise,  
> Else she will slip away, and all our drift despise.
>
> Etfsoones they heard a most melodious sound,  
> Of all that mote delight a daintie eare,  
> Such as attonce might not on liuing ground,  
> Saue in this Paradise, be heard elswhere:  
> Right hard it was, for wight, which did it heare,  
> To read, what manner musicke that mote bee:

> Birdes, voyces, instruments, windes, waters, all agree.
>
> The ioyous birdes shrouded in chearefull shade,  
> Their notes vnto the voyce attempred sweet;  
> Th'Angelicall soft trembling voyces made  
> To th'instruments diuine respondence meet:  
> The siluer sounding instruments did meet  
> With the base murmure of the waters fall:  
> The waters fall with difference discreet,  
> Now soft, now loud, vnto the wind did call:  
> The gentle warbling wind low answered to all.
>
> There, whence that Musick seemed heard to bee,  
> Was the faire Witch her selfe now solacing,  
> With a new Louer, whom through sorceree  
> And witchcraft, she from farre did thither bring:  
> There she had him now layd a slombering,  
> In secret shade, after long wanton ioyes:  
> Whilst round about them pleasauntly did sing  
> Many faire Ladies, and lasciuious boyes,  
> That euer mixt their song with light licentious toyes.
>
> And all that while, right ouer him she hong,  
> With her false eyes fast fixed in his sight,  
> As seeking medicine, whence she was stong,  
> Or greedily depasturing delight:  
> And oft inclining downe with kisses light,  
> For feare of waking him, his lips bedewd,  
> And through his humid eyes did sucke his spright,  
> Quite molten into lust and pleasure lewd;  
> Wherewith she sighed soft, as if his case she rewd.
>
> The whiles some one did chaunt this louely lay;  
> Ah see, who so faire thing doest faine to see,  
> In springing flowre the image of thy day;  
> Ah see the Virgin Rose, how sweetly shee  
> Doth first peepe forth with bashfull modestee,  
> That fairer seemes, the lesse ye see her may;  
> Lo see soone after, how more bold and free  
> Her bared bosome she doth broad display;  
> Loe see soone after, how she fades, and falles away.
>
> So passeth, in the passing of a day,  
> Of mortall life the leafe, the bud, the flowre,  
> Ne more doth flourish after first decay,  
> That earst was sought to decke both bed and bowre,  
> Of many a Ladie, and many a Paramowre:  
> Gather therefore the Rose, whilest yet is prime,  
> For soone comes age, that will her pride deflowre:  
> Gather the Rose of love, whilest yet is time,  
> Whilest louing thou mayst loued be with equall crime.
>
> He ceast, and then gan all the quire of birdes  
> Their diuerse notes t'attune vnto his lay,  
> As in approuance of his pleasing words.  
> The constant paire heard all, that he did say,  
> Yet swarued not, but kept their forward way,  
> Through many couert groues, and thickets close,  
> In which they creeping did at last display  
> That wanton Ladie, with her louer lose,  
> Whose sleepie head she in her lap did soft dispose.
>
> Vpon a bed of Roses she was layd,  
> As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin,  
> And was arayd, or rather disarayd,  
> All in a vele of silke and siluer thin,  
> That hid no whit her alablaster skin,

> Her snowy brest was bare to readie spoyle

> His warlike armes, the idle instruments
