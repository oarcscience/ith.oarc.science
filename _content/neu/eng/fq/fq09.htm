<blockquote> 
 
 
<i>Faire virgin to redeeme her deare<br> 
brings Arthur to the fight,<br>  
Who slayes the Gyant, wounds the beast,<br> 
and strips Duessa quight. </i><p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>
<blockquote>     
AY me, how many perils doe enfold<br>
The righteous man, to make him daily fall?<br>
Were not, that heauenly grace doth him vphold,<br>
And stedfast truth acquite him out of all.<br>
Her loue is firme, her care continuall,<br>
So oft as he through his owne foolish pride,<br>
Or weaknesse is to sinfull bands made thrall:<br>
Else should this <i>Redcrosse</i> knight in bands haue dyde,<br>
For whose deliuer&atilde;ce she this Prince doth thither guide.<p>
 
They sadly traueild thus, vntill they came<br>
Nigh to a castle builded strong and hie:<br>
Then cryde the Dwarfe, lo yonder is the same,<br>
In which my Lord my liege doth lucklesse lie,<br>
Thrall to that Gyants hatefull tyrannie:<br>
Therefore, deare Sir, your mightie powres assay.<br>
The noble knight alighted by and by<br>
From loftie steede, and bad the Ladie stay,<br>
To see what end of fight should him befall that day.<p>
 
So with the Squire, th'admirer of his might,<br>
He marched forth towards that castle wall;<br>
Whose gates he found fast shut, ne liuing wight<br>
To ward the same, nor answere commers call.<br>
Then tooke that Squire an horne of bugle small,<br>
Which hong adowne his side in twisted gold,<br>
And tassels gay. Wyde wonders ouer all<br>
Of that same hornes great vertues weren told,<br>
Which had approued bene in vses manifold.<p>
 
Was neuer wight, that heard that shrilling sound,<br>
But trembling feare did feele in euery vaine;<br>
Three miles it might be easie heard around,<br>
And Ecchoes three answerd it selfe againe:<br>
No false enchauntment, nor deceiptfull traine<br>
Might once abide the terror of that blast,<br>
But presently was voide and wholly vaine:<br>
No gate so strong, no locke so firme and fast,<br>
But with that percing noise flew open quite, or brast.<p>
 
The same before the Geants gate he blew,<br>
That all the castle quaked from the ground,<br>
And euery dore of freewill open flew.<br>
The Gyant selfe dismaied with that sownd,<br>
Where he with his <i>Duessa</i> dalliance fownd,<br>
In hast came rushing forth from inner bowre,<br>
With staring countenance sterne, as one astownd,<br>
And staggering steps, to weet, what suddein stowre<br>
Had wrought that horror strange, and dar'd his dreaded powre.<p>
 
And after him the proud <i>Duessa</i> came,<br>
High mounted on her manyheaded beast,<br>
And euery head with fyrie tongue did flame,<br>
And euery head was crowned on his creast,<br>
And bloudie mouthed with late cruell feast.<br>
That when the knight beheld, his mightie shild<br>
Vpon his manly arme he soone addrest,<br>
And at him fiercely flew, with courage fild,<br>
And eger greedinesse through euery member thrild.<p>
 
Therewith the Gyant buckled him to fight,<br>
Inflam'd with scornefull wrath and high disdaine,<br>
And lifting vp his dreadfull club on hight,<br>
All arm'd with ragged snubbes and knottie graine,<br>
Him thought at first encounter to haue slaine,<br>
But wise and warie was that noble Pere,<br>
And lightly leaping from so monstrous maine,<br>
Did faire auoide the violence him nere;<br>
It booted nought, to thinke, such thunderbolts to beare.<p>
 
Ne shame he thought to shunne so hideous might:<br>
The idle stroke, enforcing furious way,<br>
Missing the marke of his misaymed sight<br>
Did fall to ground, and with his heauie sway<br>
So deepely dinted in the driuen clay,<br>
That three yardes deepe a furrow vp did throw:<br>
The sad earth wounded with so sore assay,<br>
Did grone full grieuous vnderneath the blow,<br>
And trembling with strange feare, did like an earthquake show.<p>
 
As when almightie <i>Ioue</i> in wrathfull mood,<br>
To wreake the guilt of mortall sins is bent,<br>
Hurles forth his thundring dart with deadly food,<br>
Enrold in flames, and smouldring dreriment,<br>
Through riuen cloudes and molten firmament;<br>
The fierce threeforked engin making way,<br>
Both loftie towres and highest trees hath rent,<br>
And all that might his angrie passage stay,<br>
And shooting in the earth, casts vp a mount of clay.<p>
 
His boystrous club, so buried in the ground,<br>
He could not rearen vp againe so light,<br>
But that the knight him at auantage found,<br>
And whiles he stroue his combred clubbe to quight<br>
Out of the earth, with blade all burning bright<br>
He smote off his left arme, which like a blocke<br>
Did fall to ground, depriu'd of natiue might;<br>
Large streames of bloud out of the truncked stocke<br>
Forth gushed, like fresh water streame from riuen rocke.<p>
 
Dismaied with so desperate deadly wound,<br>
And eke impatient of vnwonted paine,<br>
He loudly brayd with beastly yelling sound,<br>
That all the fields rebellowed againe;<br>
As great a noyse, as when in Cymbrian plaine<br>
An heard of Bulles, whom kindly rage doth sting,<br>
Do for the milkie mothers want complaine,<br>
And fill the fields with troublous bellowing,<br>
The neighbour woods around with hollow murmur ring.<p>
 
That when his deare <i>Duessa</i> heard, and saw<br>
The euill stownd, that daungerd her estate,<br>
Vnto his aide she hastily did draw<br>
Her dreadfull beast, who swolne with bloud of late<br>
Came ramping forth with proud presumpteous gate,<br>
And threatned all his heads like flaming brands.<br>
But him the Squire made quickly to retrate,<br>
Encountring fierce with single sword in hand,<br>
And twixt him and his Lord did like a bulwarke stand.<p>
 
The proud <i>Duessa</i> full of wrathfull spight,<br>
And fierce disdaine, to be affronted so,<br>
Enforst her purple beast with all her might<br>
That stop out of the way to ouerthroe,<br>
Scorning the let of so vnequall foe:<br>
But nathemore would that courageous swayne<br>
To her yeeld passage, gainst his Lord to goe,<br>
But with outrageous strokes did him restraine,<br>
And with his bodie bard the way atwixt them twaine.<p>
 
Then tooke the angrie witch her golden cup,<br>
Which still she bore, replete with magick artes;<br>
Death and despeyre did many thereof sup,<br>
And secret poyson through their inner parts,<br>
Th'eternall bale of heauie wounded harts;<br>
Which after charmes and some enchauntments said,<br>
She lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts;<br>
Therewith his sturdie courage soone was quayd,<br>
And all his senses were with suddeine dread dismayd.<p>
 
So downe he fell before the cruell beast,<br>
Who on his necke his bloudie clawes did seize,<br>
That life nigh crusht out of his panting brest:<br>
No powre he had to stirre, nor will to rize.<br>
That when the carefull knight gan well auise,<br>
He lightly left the foe, with whom he fought,<br>
And to the beast gan turne his enterprise;<br>
For wondrous anguish in his hart it wrought,<br>
To see his loued Squire into such thraldome brought.<p>
 
And high aduauncing his bloud-thirstie blade,<br>
Stroke one of those deformed heads so sore,<br>
That of his puissance proud ensample made;<br>
His monstrous scalpe downe to his teeth it tore,<br>
And that misformed shape mis-shaped more:<br>
A sea of bloud gusht from the gaping wound,<br>
That her gay garments staynd with filthy gore,<br>
And ouerflowed all the field around;<br>
That ouer shoes in bloud he waded on the ground.<p>
 
Thereat he roared for exceeding paine,<br>
That to haue heard, great horror would haue bred,<br>
And scourging th'emptie ayre with his long traine,<br>
Through great impatience of his grieued hed<br>
His gorgeous ryder from her loftie sted<br>
Would haue cast downe, and trod in durtie myre,<br>
Had not the Gyant soone her succoured;<br>
Who all enrag'd with smart and franticke yre,<br>
Came hurtling in full fierce, and forst the knight retyre.<p>
 
The force, which wont in two to be disperst,<br>
In one alone left hand he now vnites,<br>
Which is through rage more strong then both were erst;<br>
With which his hideous club aloft he dites,<br>
And at his foe with furious rigour smites,<br>
That strongest Oake might seeme to ouerthrow.<br>
The stroke vpon his shield so heauie lites,<br>
That to the ground it doubleth him full low<br>
What mortall wight could euer beare so monstrous blow?<p>
 
And in his fall his shield, that couered was,<br>
Did loose his vele by chaunce, and open flew:<br>
The light whereof, that heauens light did pas,<br>
Such blazing brightnesse through the aier threw,<br>
That eye mote not the same endure to vew.<br>
Which when the Gyaunt spyde with staring eye,<br>
He downe let fall his arme, and soft withdrew<br>
His weapon huge, that heaued was on hye<br>
For to haue slaine the man, that on the ground did lye.<p>
 
And eke the fruitfull-headed beast, amaz'd<br>
At flashing beames of that sunshiny shield,<br>
Became starke blind, and all his senses daz'd,<br>
That downe he tumbled on the durtie field,<br>
And seem'd himselfe as conquered to yield.<br>
Whom when his maistresse proud perceiu'd to fall,<br>
Whiles yet his feeble feet for faintnesse reeld,<br>
Vnto the Gyant loudly she gan call,<br>
O helpe <i>Orgoglio</i>, helpe, or else we perish all.<p>
 
At her so pitteous cry was much amoou'd<br>
Her champion stout, and for to ayde his frend,<br>
Againe his wonted angry weapon proou'd:<br>
But all in vaine: for he has read his end<br>
In that bright shield, and all their forces spend<br>
Themselues in vaine: for since that glauncing sight,<br>
He hath no powre to hurt, nor to defend;<br>
As where th'Almighties lightning brond does light,<br>
It dimmes the dazed eyen, and daunts the senses quight.<p>
 
Whom when the Prince, to battell new addrest,<br>
And threatning high his dreadfull stroke did see,<br>
His sparkling blade about his head he blest,<br>
And smote off quite his right leg by the knee,<br>
That downe he tombled; as an aged tree,<br>
High growing on the top of rocky clift,<br>
Whose hartstrings with keene steele nigh hewen be,<br>
The mightie trunck halfe rent, with ragged rift<br>
Doth roll adowne the rocks, and fall with fearefull drift.<p>
 
Or as a Castle reared high and round,<br>
By subtile engins and malitious slight<br>
Is vndermined from the lowest ground<br>
And her foundation forst, and feebled quight,<br>
At last downe falles, and with her heaped hight<br>
Her hastie ruine does more heauie make,<br>
And yields it selfe vnto the victours might;<br>
Such was this Gyaunts fall, that seemd to shake<br>
The stedfast globe of earth, as it for feare did quake.<p>
 
The knight then lightly leaping to the pray,<br>
With mortall steele him smot againe so sore,<br>
That headlesse his vnweldy bodie lay,<br>
All wallowd in his owne fowle bloudy gore,<br>
Which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store,<br>
But soone as breath out of his breast did pas,<br>
That huge great body, which the Gyaunt bore,<br>
Was vanisht quite, and of that monstrous mas<br>
Was nothing left, but like an emptie bladder was.<p>
 
Whose grieuous fall, when false <i>Duessa</i> spide,<br>
Her golden cup she cast vnto the ground,<br>
And crowned mitre rudely threw aside;<br>
Such percing griefe her stubborne hart did wound,<br>
That she could not endure that dolefull stound,<br>
But leauing all behind her, fled away:<br>
The light-foot Squire her quickly turnd around,<br>
And by hard meanes enforcing her to stay,<br>
So brought vnto his Lord, as his deserued pray.<p>
 
The royall Virgin, which beheld from farre,<br>
In pensiue plight, and sad perplexitie,<br>
The whole atchieuement of this doubtfull warre,<br>
Came running fast to greet his victorie,<br>
With sober gladnesse, and myld modestie,<br>
And with sweet ioyous cheare him thus bespake;<br>
Faire braunch of noblesse, flowre of cheualrie,<br>
That with your worth the world amazed make,<br>
How shall I quite the paines, ye suffer for my sake?<p>
 
And you fresh bud of vertue springing fast,<br>
Whom these sad eyes saw nigh vnto deaths dore,<br>
What hath poore Virgin for such perill past,<br>
Wherewith you to reward? Accept therefore<br>
My simple selfe, and seruice euermore;<br>
And he that high does sit, and all things see<br>
With equall eyes, their merites to restore,<br>
Behold what ye this day haue done for mee,<br>
And what I cannot quite, requite with vsuree.<p>
 
But sith the heauens, and your faire handeling<br>
Haue made you maister of the field this day,<br>
Your fortune maister eke with gouerning,<br>
And well begun end all so well, I pray,<br>
Ne let that wicked woman scape away;<br>
For she it is, that did my Lord bethrall,<br>
My dearest Lord, and deepe in dongeon lay,<br>
Where he his better dayes hath wasted all.<br>
O heare, how piteous he to you for ayd does call.<p>
 
Forthwith he gaue in charge vnto his Squire,<br>
That scarlot whore to keepen carefully;<br>
Whiles he himselfe with greedie great desire<br>
Into the Castle entred forcibly,<br>
Where liuing creature none he did espye;<br>
Then gan he lowdly through the house to call:<br>
But no man car'd to answere to his crye.<br>
There raignd a solemne silence ouer all,<br>
Nor voice was heard, nor wight was seene in bowre or hall.<p>
 
At last with creeping crooked pace forth came<br>
An old old man, with beard as white as snow,<br>
That on a staffe his feeble steps did frame,<br>
And guide his wearie gate both too and fro:<br>
For his eye sight him failed long ygo,<br>
And on his arme a bounch of keyes he bore,<br>
The which vnused rust did ouergrow:<br>
Those were the keyes of euery inner dore,<br>
But he could not them vse, but kept them still in store.<p>
 
But very vncouth sight was to behold,<br>
How he did fashion his vntoward pace,<br>
For as he forward moou'd his footing old,<br>
So backward still was turnd his wrincled face,<br>
Vnlike to men, who euer as they trace,<br>
Both feet and face one way are wont to lead.<br>
This was the auncient keeper of that place,<br>
And foster father of the Gyant dead;<br>
His name <i>Ignaro</i> did his nature right aread.<p>
 
His reuerend haires and holy grauitie<br>
The knight much honord, as beseemed well,<br>
And gently askt, where all the people bee,<br>
Which in that stately building wont to dwell.<br>
Who answerd him full soft, he could not tell.<br>
Againe he askt, where that same knight was layd,<br>
Whom great <i>Orgoglio</i> with his puissaunce fell<br>
Had made his caytiue thrall; againe he sayde,<br>
He could not tell: ne euer other answere made.<p>
 
Then asked he, which way he in might pas:<br>
He could not tell, againe he answered.<br>
Thereat the curteous knight displeased was,<br>
And said, Old sire, it seemes thou hast not red<br>
How ill it sits with that same siluer hed<br>
In vaine to mocke, or mockt in vaine to bee:<br>
But if thou be, as thou art pourtrahed<br>
With natures pen, in ages graue degree,<br>
Aread in grauer wise, what I demaund of thee.<p>
 
His answere likewise was, he could not tell.<br>
Whose senceless speach, and doted ignorance<br>
When as the noble Prince had marked well,<br>
He ghest his nature by his countenance,<br>
And calmd his wrath with goodly temperance.<br>
Then to him stepping, from his arme did reach<br>
Those keyes, and made himselfe free enterance.<br>
Each dore he opened without any breach;<br>
There was no barre to stop, nor foe him to empeach.<p>
 
There all within full rich arayd he found,<br>
With royall arras and resplendent gold.<br>
And did with store of euery thing abound,<br>
That greatest Princes presence might behold.<br>
But all the floore (too filthy to be told)<br>
With bloud of guiltlesse babes, and innocents trew,<br>
Which there were slaine, as sheepe out of the fold,<br>
Defiled was, that dreadfull was to vew,<br>
And sacred ashes ouer it was strowed new.<p>
 
And there beside of marble stone was built<br>
An Altare, caru'd with cunning imagery,<br>
On which true Christians bloud was often spilt,<br>
And holy Martyrs often doen to dye,<br>
With cruell malice and strong tyranny:<br>
Whose blessed sprites from vnderneath the stone<br>
To God for vengeance cryde continually,<br>
And with great griefe were often heard to grone,<br>
That hardest heart would bleede, to heare their piteous mone.<p>
 
Through euery rowme he sought, and euery bowr,<br>
But no where could he find that wofull thrall:<br>
At last he came vnto an yron doore,<br>
That fast was lockt, but key found not at all<br>
Emongst that bounch, to open it withall;<br>
But in the same a little grate was pight,<br>
Through which he sent his voyce, and lowd did call<br>
With all his powre, to weet, if liuing wight<br>
Were housed therewithin, whom he enlargen might.<p>
 
Therewith an hollow, dreary, murmuring voyce<br>
These piteous plaints and dolours did resound;<br>
O who is that, which brings me happy choyce<br>
Of death, that here lye dying euery stound,<br>
Yet liue perforce in balefull darkenesse bound?<br>
For now three Moones haue ch&atilde;ged thrice their hew,<br>
And haue beene thrice hid vnderneath the ground,<br>
Since I the heauens chearefull face did vew,<br>
O welcome thou, that doest of death bring tydings trew.<p>
 
Which when that Champion heard, with percing point<br>
Of pitty deare his hart was thrilled sore,<br>
And trembling horrour ran through euery ioynt,<br>
For ruth of gentle knight so fowle forlore:<br>
Which shaking off, he rent that yron dore,<br>
With furious force, and indignation fell;<br>
Where entred in, his foot could find no flore,<br>
But all a deepe descent, as darke as hell,<br>
That breathed euer forth a filthie banefull smell.<p>
 
But neither darkenesse fowle, nor filthy bands,<br>
Nor noyous smell his purpose could withhold,<br>
(Entire affection hateth nicer hands)<br>
But that with constant zeale, and courage bold,<br>
After long paines and labours manifold,<br>
He found the meanes that Prisoner vp to reare;<br>
Whose feeble thighes, vnhable to vphold<br>
His pined corse, him scarse to light could beare,<br>
A ruefull spectacle of death and ghastly drere.<p>
 
His sad dull eyes deepe sunck in hollow pits,<br>
Could not endure th'vnwonted sunne to view;<br>
His bare thin cheekes for want of better bits,<br>
And empty sides deceiued of their dew,<br>
Could make a stony hart his hap to rew;<br>
His rawbone armes, whose mighty brawned bowrs<br>
Were wont to riue steele plates, and helmets hew,<br>
Were cleane consum'd, and all his vitall powres<br>
Decayd, and all his flesh shronk vp like withered flowres.<p>
 
Whom when his Lady saw, to him she ran<br>
With hasty ioy: to see him made her glad,<br>
And sad to view his visage pale and wan,<br>
Who earst in flowres of freshest youth was clad.<br>
Tho when her well of teares she wasted had,<br>
She said, Ah dearest Lord, what euill starre<br>
On you hath fround, and pourd his influence bad,<br>
That of your selfe ye thus berobbed arre,<br>
And this misseeming hew your manly looks doth marre?<p>
 
But welcome now my Lord, in wele or woe,<br>
Whose presence I haue lackt too long a day;<br>
And fie on Fortune mine auowed foe,<br>
Whose wrathfull wreakes them selues do now alay.<br>
And for these wrongs shall treble penaunce pay<br>
Of treble good: good growes of euils priefe.<br>
The chearelesse man, whom sorrow did dismay,<br>
Had no delight to treaten of his griefe;<br>
His long endured famine needed more reliefe.<p>
 
Faire Lady, then said that victorious knight,<br>
The things, that grieuous were to do, or beare,<br>
Them to renew, I wote, breeds no delight:<br>
Best musicke breeds delight in loathing eare:<br>
But th'onely good, that growes of passed feare,<br>
Is to be wise, and ware of like agein.<br>
This dayes ensample hath this lesson deare<br>
Deepe written in my heart with yron pen,<br>
That blisse may not abide in state of mortall men.<p>
 
Henceforth sir knight, take to you wonted strength,<br>
And maister these mishaps with patient might;<br>
Loe where your foe lyes stretcht in monstrous length,<br>
And loe that wicked woman in your sight,<br>
The roote of all your care, and wretched plight,<br>
Now in your powre, to let her liue, or dye.<br>
To do her dye (quoth <i>Vna</i>) were despight,<br>
And shame t'auenge so weake an enimy;<br>
But spoile her of her scarlot robe, and let her fly.<p>
 
So as she bad, that witch they disaraid,<br>
And robd of royall robes, and purple pall,<br>
And ornaments that richly were displaid;<br>
Ne spared they to strip her naked all.<br>
Then when they had despoild her tire and call,<br>
Such as she was, their eyes might her behold,<br>
That her misshaped parts did them appall,<br>
A loathly, wrinckled hag, ill fauoured, old,<br>
Whose secret filth good manners biddeth not be told.<p>
 
Her craftie head was altogether bald,<br>
And as in hate of honorable eld,<br>
Was ouergrowne with scurfe and filthy scald;<br>
Her teeth out of her rotten gummes were feld,<br>
And her sowre breath abhominably smeld;<br>
Her dried dugs, like bladders lacking wind,<br>
Hong downe, and filthy matter from them weld;<br>
Her wrizled skin as rough, as maple rind,<br>
So scabby was, that would haue loathd all womankind.<p>
 
Her neather parts, the shame of all her kind,<br>
My chaster Muse for shame doth blush to write;<br>
But at her rompe she growing had behind<br>
A foxes taile, with dong all fowly dight;<br>
And eke her feete most monstrous were in sight;<br>
For one of them was like an Eagles claw,<br>
With griping talaunts armd to greedy fight,<br>
The other like a Beares vneuen paw:<br>
More vgly shape yet neuer liuing creature saw.<p>
 
Which when the knights beheld, amazd they were,<br>
And wondred at so fowle deformed wight.<br>
Such then (said <i>Vna</i>) as she seemeth here,<br>
Such is the face of falshood, such the sight<br>
Of fowle <i>Duessa</i>, when her borrowed light<br>
Is laid away, and counterfesaunce knowne.<br>
Thus when they had the witch disrobed quight,<br>
And all her filthy feature open showne,<br>
They let her goe at will, and wander wayes vnknowne.<p>
 
She flying fast from heauens hated face,<br>
And from the world that her discouered wide,<br>
Fled to the wastfull wildernesse apace,<br>
From liuing eyes her open shame to hide,<br>
And lurkt in rocks and caues long vnespide.<br>
But that faire crew of knights, and <i>Vna</i> faire<br>
Did in that castle afterwards abide,<br>
To rest them selues, and weary powres repaire,<br>
Where store they found of all, that dainty was and rare.<p>

O Goodly golden chaine, wherewith yfere<br>

Faire virgin (said the Prince) ye me require<br>

Vnder the foot of <i>Rauran</i> mossy hore,<br>
From whence the riuer <i>Dee</i> as siluer cleene<br>
His tombling billowes rolls with gentle rore:<br>
There all my dayes he traind me vp in vertuous lore.<p>
 
Thither the great Magicien <i>Merlin</i> came,<br>
As was his vse, ofttimes to visit me:<br>
For he had charge my discipline to frame,<br>
And Tutours nouriture to ouersee.<br>
Him oft and oft I askt in priuitie,<br>
Of what loines and what lignage I did spring:<br>
Whose aunswere bad me still assured bee,<br>
That I was sonne and heire vnto a king,<br>
As time in her iust terme the truth to light should bring.<p>
 
Well worthy impe, said then the Lady gent,<br>
And Pupill fit for such a Tutours hand.<br>
But what aduenture, or what high intent<br>
Hath brought you hither into Faery land,<br>
Aread Prince <i>Arthur</i>, crowne of Martiall band?<br>
Full hard it is (quoth he) to read aright<br>
The course of heauenly cause, or vnderstand<br>
The secret meaning of th'eternall might,<br>
That rules mens wayes, and rules the thoughts of liuing wight.<p>
 
For whither he through fatall deepe foresight<br>
Me hither sent, for cause to me vnghest,<br>
Or that fresh bleeding wound, which day and night<br>
Whilome doth rancle in my riuen brest,<br>
With forced fury following his behest,<br>
Me hither brought by wayes yet neuer found,<br>
You to haue helpt I hold my selfe yet blest.<br>
Ah curteous knight (quoth she) what secret wound<br>
Could euer find, to grieue the gentlest hart on ground?<p>
 
Deare Dame (quoth he) you sleeping sparkes awake,<br>
Which troubled once, into huge flames will grow,<br>
Ne euer will their feruent fury slake,<br>
Till liuing moysture into smoke do flow,<br>
And wasted life do lye in ashes low.<br>
Yet sithens silence lesseneth not my fire,<br>
But told it flames, and hidden it does glow,<br>
I will reuele, what ye so much desire:<br>
Ah Loue, lay downe thy bow, the whiles I may respire.<p>
 
It was in freshest flowre of youthly yeares,<br>
When courage first does creepe in manly chest,<br>
Then first the coale of kindly heat appeares<br>
To kindle loue in euery liuing brest;<br>
But me had warnd old <i>Timons</i> wise behest,<br>
Those creeping flames by reason to subdew,<br>
Before their rage grew to so great vnrest,<br>
As miserable louers vse to rew,<br>
Which still wex old in woe, whiles woe still wexeth new.<p>
 
That idle name of loue, and louers life,<br>
As losse of time, and vertues enimy<br>
I euer scornd, and ioyd to stirre vp strife,<br>
In middest of their mournfull Tragedy,<br>
Ay wont to laugh, when them I heard to cry,<br>
And blow the fire, which them to ashes brent:<br>
Their God himselfe, grieu'd at my libertie,<br>
Shot many a dart at me with fiers intent,<br>
But I them warded all with wary gouernment.<p>
 
But all in vaine: no fort can be so strong,<br>
Ne fleshly brest can armed be so sound,<br>
But will at last be wonne with battrie long,<br>
Or vnawares at disauantage found;<br>
Nothing is sure, that growes on earthly ground:<br>
And who most trustes in arme of fleshly might,<br>
And boasts, in beauties chaine not to be bound,<br>
Doth soonest fall in disauentrous fight,<br>
And yeeldes his caytiue neck to victours most despight.<p>
 
Ensample make of him your haplesse ioy,<br>
And of my selfe now mated, as ye see;<br>
Whose prouder vaunt that proud auenging boy<br>
Did soone pluck downe, and curbd my libertie.<br>
For on a day prickt forth with iollitie<br>
Of looser life, and heat of hardiment,<br>
Raunging the forest wide on courser free,<br>
The fields, the floods, the heauens with one consent<br>
Did seeme to laugh on me, and fauour mine intent.<p>
 
For-wearied with my sports, I did alight<br>
From loftie steed, and downe to sleepe me layd;<br>
The verdant gras my couch did goodly dight,<br>
And pillow was my helmet faire displayd:<br>
Whiles euery sence the humour sweet embayd,<br>
And slombring soft my hart did steale away,<br>
Me seemed, by my side a royall Mayd<br>
Her daintie limbes full softly down did lay:<br>
So faire a creature yet saw neuer sunny day.<p>
 
Most goodly glee and louely blandishment<br>
She to me made, and bad me loue her deare,<br>
For dearely sure her loue was to me bent,<br>
As when iust time expired should appeare.<br>
But whether dreames delude, or true it were,<br>
Was neuer hart so rauisht with delight,<br>
Ne liuing man like words did euer heare,<br>
As she to me deliuered all that night;<br>
And at her parting said, She Queene of Faeries hight.<p>
 
When I awoke, and found her place deuoyd,<br>
And nought but pressed gras, where she had lyen,<br>
I sorrowed all so much, as earst I ioyd,<br>
And washed all her place with watry eyen.<br>
From that day forth I lou'd that face diuine;<br>
From that day forth I cast in carefull mind,<br>
To seeke her out with labour, and long tyne,<br>
And neuer vow to rest, till her I find,<br>
Nine monethes I seeke in vaine yet ni'll that vow vnbind.<p>
 
Thus as he spake, his visage wexed pale,<br>
And chaunge of hew great passion did bewray;<br>
Yet still he stroue to cloke his inward bale,<br>
And hide the smoke, that did his fire display,<br>
Till gentle <i>Vna</i> thus to him gan say;<br>
O happy Queene of Faeries, that hast found<br>
Mongst many, one that with his prowesse may<br>
Defend thine honour, and thy foes confound:<br>
True Loues are oft&#7869; sown, but seldom grow on ground.<p>
 
Thine, O then, said the gentle <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
Next to that Ladies loue, shalbe the place,<br>
O fairest virgin, full of heauenly light,<br>
Whose wondrous faith, exceeding earthly race,<br>
Was firmest fixt in mine extremest case,<br>
And you, my Lord, the Patrone of my life,<br>
Of that great Queene may well gaine worthy grace:<br>
For onely worthy you through prowes priefe<br>
Yf liuing man mote worthy be, to be her liefe.<p>
 
So diuersly discoursing of their loues,<br>
The golden Sunne his glistring head gan shew,<br>
And sad remembraunce now the Prince amoues,<br>
With fresh desire his voyage to pursew:<br>
Als <i>Vna</i> earnd her traueill to renew.<br>
Then those two knights, fast friendship for to bynd,<br>
And loue establish each to other trew,<br>
Gaue goodly gifts, the signes of gratefull mynd,<br>
And eke as pledges firme, right hands together ioynd.<p>
 
Prince <i>Arthur</i> gaue a boxe of Diamond sure,<br>
Embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament,<br>
Wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure,<br>
Of wondrous worth, and vertue excellent,<br>
That any wound could heale incontinent:<br>
Which to requite, the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight him gaue<br>
A booke, wherein his Saueours testament<br>
Was writ with golden letters rich and braue;<br>
A worke of wondrous grace, and able soules to saue.<p>
 
Thus beene they parted, <i>Arthur</i> on his way<br>
To seeke his loue, and th'other for to fight<br>
With <i>Vnaes</i> foe, that all her realme did pray.<br>
But she now weighing the decayed plight,<br>
And shrunken synewes of her chosen knight,<br>
Would not a while her forward course pursew,<br>
Ne bring him forth in face of dreadfull fight,<br>
Till he recouered had his former hew:<br>
For him to be yet weake and wearie well she knew.<p>
 
So as they traueild, lo they gan espy<br>
An armed knight towards them gallop fast,<br>
That seemed from some feared foe to fly,<br>
Or other griesly thing, that him agast.<br>
Still as he fled, his eye was backward cast,<br>
As if his feare still followed him behind;<br>
Als flew his steed, as he his bands had brast,<br>
And with his winged heeles did tread the wind,<br>
As he had beene a fole of <i>Pegasus</i> his kind.<p>
 
Nigh as he drew, they might perceiue his head<br>
To be vnarmd, and curld vncombed heares<br>
Vpstaring stiffe, dismayd with vncouth dread;<br>
Nor drop of bloud in all his face appeares<br>
Nor life in limbe: and to increase his feares,<br>
In fowle reproch of knighthoods faire degree,<br>
About his neck an hempen rope he weares,<br>
That with his glistring armes does ill agree;<br>
But he of rope or armes has now no memoree.<p>
 
The <i>Redcrosse</i> knight toward him crossed fast,<br>
To weet, what mister wight was so dismayd:<br>
There him he finds all sencelesse and aghast,<br>
That of him selfe he seemd to be afrayd;<br>
Whom hardly he from flying forward stayd,<br>
Till he these wordes to him deliuer might;<br>
Sir knight, aread who hath ye thus arayd,<br>
And eke from whom make ye this hasty flight:<br>
For neuer knight I saw in such misseeming plight.<p>
 
He answerd nought at all, but adding new<br>
Feare to his first amazment, staring wide<br>
With stony eyes, and hartlesse hollow hew,<br>
Astonisht stood, as one that had aspide<br>
Infernall furies, with their chaines vntide.<br>
Him yet againe, and yet againe bespake<br>
The gentle knight; who nought to him replide,<br>
But trembling euery ioynt did inly quake,<br>
And foltring tongue at last these words seemd forth to shake.<p>
 
For Gods deare loue, Sir knight, do me not stay;<br>
For loe he comes, he comes fast after mee.<br>
Eft looking backe would faine haue runne away;<br>
But he him forst to stay, and tellen free<br>
The secret cause of his perplexitie:<br>
Yet nathemore by his bold hartie speach,<br>
Could his bloud-frosen hart emboldned bee,<br>
But through his boldnesse rather feare did reach,<br>
Yet forst, at last he made through silence suddein breach.<p>
 
And am I now in safetie sure (quoth he)<br>
From him, that would haue forced me to dye?<br>
And is the point of death now turnd fro mee,<br>
That I may tell this haplesse history?<br>
Feare nought: (quoth he) no daunger now is nye?<br>
Then shall I you recount a ruefull cace,<br>
(Said he) the which with this vnlucky eye<br>
I late beheld, and had not greater grace<br>
Me reft from it, had bene partaker of the place.<p>
 
I lately chaunst (Would I had neuer chaunst)<br>
With a faire knight to keepen companee,<br>
Sir <i>Terwin</i> hight, that well himselfe aduaunst<br>
In all affaires, and was both bold and free,<br>
But not so happie as mote happie bee:<br>
He lou'd, as was his lot, a Ladie gent,<br>
That him againe lou'd in the least degree:<br>
For she was proud, and of too high intent,<br>
And ioyd to see her louer languish and lament.<p>
 
From whom returning sad and comfortlesse,<br>
As on the way together we did fare,<br>
We met that villen (God from him me blesse)<br>
That cursed wight, from whom I scapt whyleare,<br>
A man of hell, that cals himselfe <i>Despaire</i>:<br>
Who first vs greets, and after faire areedes<br>
Of tydings strange, and of aduentures rare:<br>
So creeping close, as Snake in hidden weedes,<br>
Inquireth of our states, and of our knightly deedes.<p>
 
Which when he knew, and felt ourfeeble harts<br>
Embost with bale, and bitter byting griefe,<br>
Which loue had launched with his deadly darts,<br>
With wounding words and termes of foule repriefe<br>
He pluckt from vs all hope of due reliefe,<br>
That earst vs held in loue of lingring life;<br>
Then hopelesse hartlesse, gan the cunning thiefe<br>
Perswade vs die, to stint all further strife:<br>
To me he lent this rope, to him a rustie knife.<p>
 
With which sad instrument of hastie death,<br>
That wofull louer, loathing lenger light,<br>
A wide way made to let forth liuing breath.<br>
But I more fearefull, or more luckie wight,<br>
Dismayd with that deformed dismall sight,<br>
Fled fast away, halfe dead with dying feare:<br>
Ne yet assur'd of life by you, Sir knight,<br>
Whose like infirmitie like chaunce may beare:<br>
But God you neuer let his charmed speeches heare.<p>
 
How may a man (said he) with idle speach<br>
Be wonne, to spoyle the Castle of his health?<br>
I wote (quoth he) whom triall late did teach,<br>
That like would not for all this worldes wealth:<br>
His subtill tongue, like dropping honny, mealt'th<br>
Into the hart, and searcheth euery vaine,<br>
That ere one be aware, by secret stealth<br>
His powre is reft, and weaknesse doth remaine.<br>
O neuer Sir desire to try his guilefull traine.<p>
 
Certes (said he) hence shall I neuer rest,<br>
Till I that treachours art haue heard and tride;<br>
And you Sir knight, whose name mote I request,<br>
Of grace do me vnto his cabin guide.<br>
I that hight <i>Treuisan</i> (quoth he) will ride<br>
Against my liking backe, to doe you grace:<br>
But nor for gold nor glee will I abide<br>
By you, when ye arriue in that same place;<br>
For leuer had I die, then see his deadly face.<p>
 
Ere long they come, where that same wicked wight<br>
His dwelling has, low in an hollow caue,<br>
Farre vnderneath a craggie clift ypight,<br>
Darke, dolefull, drearie, like a greedie graue,<br>
That still for carrion carcases doth craue:<br>
On top whereof aye dwelt the ghastly Owle,<br>
Shrieking his balefull note, which euer draue<br>
Farre from that haunt all other chearefull fowle;<br>
And all about it wandring ghostes did waile and howle.<p>
 
And all about old stockes and stubs of trees,<br>
Whereon nor fruit, nor leafe was euer seene,<br>
Did hang vpon the ragged rocky knees;<br>
On which had many wretches hanged beene,<br>
Whose carcases were scattered on the greene,<br>
And throwne about the cliffs. Arriued there,<br>
That bare-head knight for dread and dolefull teene,<br>
Would faine haue fled, ne durst approchen neare,<br>
But th'other forst him stay, and comforted in feare.<p>
 
That darkesome caue they enter, where they find<br>
That cursed man, low sitting on the ground,<br>
Musing full sadly in his sullein mind;<br>
His griesie lockes, long growen, and vnbound,<br>
Disordred hong about his shoulders round,<br>
And hid his face; through which his hollow eyne<br>
Lookt deadly dull, and stared as astound;<br>
His raw-bone cheekes through penurie and pine,<br>
Were shronke into his iawes, as he did neuer dine.<p>
 
His garment nought but many ragged clouts,<br>
With thornes together pind and patched was,<br>
The which his naked sides he wrapt abouts;<br>
And him beside there lay vpon the gras<br>
A drearie corse, whose life away did pas,<br>
All wallowd in his owne yet luke-warme blood,<br>
That from his wound yet welled fresh alas;<br>
In which a rustie knife fast fixed stood,<br>
And made an open passage for the gushing flood.<p>
 
Which piteous spectacle, approuing trew<br>
The wofull tale that <i>Treuisan</i> had told,<br>
When as the gentle <i>Redcrosse</i> knight did vew,<br>
With firie zeale he burnt in courage bold,<br>
Him to auenge, before his bloud were cold,<br>
And to the villein said, Thou damned wight,<br>
The author of this fact, we here behold,<br>
What iustice can but iudge against thee right,<br>
With thine owne bloud to price his bloud, here shed in sight.<p>
 
What franticke fit (quoth he) hath thus distraught<br>
Thee, foolish man, so rash a doome to giue?<br>
What iustice euer other iudgement taught,<br>
But he should die, who merites not to liue?<br>
None else to death this man despayring driue,<br>
But his owne guiltie mind deseruing death.<br>
Is then vniust to each his due to giue?<br>
Or let him die, that loatheth liuing breath?<br>
Or let him die at ease, that liueth here vneath?<p>
 
Who trauels by the wearie wandring way,<br>
To come vnto his wished home in haste,<br>
And meetes a flood, that doth his passage stay,<br>
Is not great grace to helpe him ouer past,<br>
Or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?<br>
Most enuious man, that grieues at neighbours good,<br>
And fond, that ioyest in the woe thou hast,<br>
Why wilt not let him passe, that long hath stood<br>
Vpon the banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood?<p>
 
He there does now enioy eternall rest<br>
And happie ease, which thou doest want and craue,<br>
And further from it daily wanderest:<br>
What if some litle paine the passage haue,<br>
That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?<br>
Is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,<br>
And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet graue?<br>
Sleepe after toyle, port after stormie seas,<br>
Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.<p>
 
The knight much wondred at his suddeine wit,<br>
And said, The terme of life is limited,<br>
Ne may a man prolong, nor shorten it;<br>
The souldier may not moue from watchfull sted,<br>
Nor leaue his stand, vntill his Captaine bed.<br>
Who life did limit by almightie doome,<br>
(Quoth he) knowes best the termes established;<br>
And he, that points the Centonell his roome,<br>
Doth license him depart at sound of morning droome.<p>
 
Is not his deed, what euer thing is donne,<br>
In heauen and earth? did not he all create<br>
To die againe? all ends that was begonne.<br>
Their times in his eternall booke of fate<br>
Are written sure, and haue their certaine date.<br>
Who then can striue with strong necessitie,<br>
That holds the world in his still chaunging state,<br>
Or shunne the death ordaynd by destinie?<br>
Wh&#7869; houre of death is come, let none aske whence, nor why.<p>
 
The lenger life, I wote the greater sin,<br>
The greater sin, the greater punishment:<br>
All those great battels, which thou boasts to win,<br>
Through strife, and bloud-shed, and auengement,<br>
Now praysd, hereafter deare thou shalt repent:<br>
For life must life, and bloud must bloud repay.<br>
Is not enough thy euill life forespent?<br>
For he, that once hath missed the right way,<br>
The further he doth goe, the further he doth stray.<p>
 
Then do no further goe, no further stray,<br>
But here lie downe, and to thy rest betake,<br>
Th'ill to preuent, that life ensewen may.<br>
For what hath life, that may it loued make,<br>
And giues not rather cause it to forsake?<br>
Feare, sicknesse, age, losse, labour, sorrow, strife,<br>
Paine, hunger, cold, that makes the hart to quake;<br>
And euer fickle fortune rageth rife,<br>
All which, and thousands mo do make a loathsome life.<p>
 
Thou wretched man, of death hast greatest need,<br>
If in true ballance thou wilt weigh thy state:<br>
For neuer knight, that dared warlike deede,<br>
More lucklesse disauentures did amate:<br>
Witnesse the dongeon deepe, wherein of late<br>
Thy life shut vp, for death so oft did call;<br>
And though good lucke prolonged hath thy date,<br>
Yet death then, would the like mishaps forestall,<br>
Into the which hereafter thou maiest happen fall.<p>
 
Why then doest thou, &ocirc; man of sin, desire<br>
To draw thy dayes forth to their last degree?<br>
Is not the measure of thy sinfull hire<br>
High heaped vp with huge iniquitie,<br>
Against the day of wrath, to burden thee?<br>
Is not enough, that to this Ladie milde<br>
Thou falsed hast thy faith with periurie,<br>
And sold thy selfe to serue <i>Duessa</i> vilde,<br>
With whom in all abuse thou hast thy selfe defilde?<p>
 
Is not he iust, that all this doth behold<br>
From highest heauen, and beares an equall eye?<br>
Shall he thy sins vp in his knowledge fold,<br>
And guiltie be of thine impietie?<br>
Is not his law, Let euery sinner die:<br>
Die shall all flesh? what then must needs be donne,<br>
Is it not better to doe willinglie,<br>
Then linger, till the glasse be all out ronne?<br>
Death is the end of woes: die soone, O faeries sonne.<p>
 
The knight was much enmoued with his speach,<br>
That as a swords point through his hart did perse,<br>
And in his conscience made a secret breach,<br>
Well knowing true all, that he did reherse,<br>
And to his fresh remembrance did reuerse<br>
The vgly vew of his deformed crimes,<br>
That all his manly powres it did disperse,<br>
As he were charmed with inchaunted rimes,<br>
That oftentimes he quakt, and fainted oftentimes.<p>
 
In which amazement, when the Miscreant<br>
Perceiued him to wauer weake and fraile,<br>
Whiles trembling horror did his conscience dant,<br>
And hellish anguish did his soule assaile,<br>
To driue him to despaire, and quite to quaile,<br>
He shew'd him painted in a table plaine,<br>
The damned ghosts, that doe in torments waile,<br>
And thousand feends that doe them endlesse paine<br>
With fire and brimstone, which for euer shall remaine.<p>
 
The sight whereof so throughly him dismaid,<br>
That nought but death before his eyes he saw,<br>
And euer burning wrath before him laid,<br>
By righteous sentence of th'Almighties law:<br>
Then gan the villein him to ouercraw,<br>
And brought vnto him swords, ropes, poison, fire,<br>
And all that might him to perdition draw;<br>
And bad him choose, what death he would desire:<br>
For death was due to him, that had prouokt Gods ire.<p>
 
But when as none of them he saw him take,<br>
He to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene,<br>
And gaue it him in hand: his hand did quake,<br>
And tremble like a leafe of Aspin greene,<br>
And troubled bloud through his pale face was seene<br>
To come, and goe with tydings from the hart,<br>
As it a running messenger had beene.<br>
At last resolu'd to worke his finall smart,<br>
He lifted vp his hand, that backe againe did start.<p>
 
Which when as <i>Vna</i> saw, through euery vaine<br>
The crudled cold ran to her well of life,<br>
As in a swowne: but soone reliu'd againe,<br>
Out of his hand she snatcht the cursed knife,<br>
And threw it to the ground, enraged rife,<br>
And to him said, Fie, fie, faint harted knight,<br>
What meanest thou by this reprochfull strife?<br>
Is this the battell, which thou vauntst to fight<br>
With that fire-mouthed Dragon, horrible and bright?<p>
 
Come, come away, fraile, seely, fleshly wight,<br>
Ne let vaine words bewitch thy manly hart,<br>
Ne diuelish thoughts dismay thy constant spright.<br>
In heauenly mercies hast thou not a part?<br>
Why shouldst thou then despeire, that chosen art?<br>
Where iustice growes, there grows eke greater grace,<br>
The which doth quench the brond of hellish smart,<br>
And that accurst hand-writing doth deface,<br>
Arise, Sir knight arise, and leaue this cursed place.<p>
 
So vp he rose, and thence amounted streight.<br>
Which when the carle beheld, and saw his guest<br>
Would safe depart, for all his subtill sleight,<br>
He chose an halter from among the rest,<br>
And with it hung himselfe, vnbid vnblest.<br>
But death he could not worke himselfe thereby;<br>
For thousand times he so himselfe had drest,<br>
Yet nathelesse it could not doe him die,<br>
Till he should die his last, that is eternally.<p>
