*Cant. V.*

> *Prince Arthur heares of Florimell:  
> three fosters Timias wound,  
> Belphebe finds him almost dead,  
> and reareth out of sownd.*

> VV Onder it is to see, in diuerse minds,  
> How diuersly loue doth his pageants play,  
> And shewes his powre in variable kinds:  
> The baser wit, whose idle thoughts alway  
> Are wont to cleaue vnto the lowly clay,  
> It stirreth vp to sensuall desire,  
> And in lewd slouth to wast his carelesse day:  
> But in braue sprite it kindles goodly fire,  
> That to all high desert and honour doth aspire.
>
> Ne suffereth it vncomely idlenesse,  
> In his free thought to build her sluggish nest:  
> Ne suffereth it thought of vngentlenesse,  
> Euer to creepe into his noble brest,  
> But to the highest and the worthiest  
> Lifteth it vp, that else would lowly fall:  
> It lets not fall, it lets it not to rest:  
> It lets not scarse this Prince to breath at all,  
> But to his first poursuit him forward still doth call.
>
> Who long time wandred through the forrest wyde,  
> To finde some issue thence, till that at last  
> He met a Dwarfe, that seemed terrifyde  
> With some late perill, which he hardly past,  
> Or other accident, which him aghast;  
> Of whom he asked, whence he lately came,  
> And whither now he trauelled so fast:  
> For sore he swat, and running through that same  
> Thicke forest, was bescratcht, & both his feet nigh lame.
>
> Panting for breath, and almost out of hart,  
> The Dwarfe him answerd, Sir, ill mote I stay  
> To tell the same. I lately did depart  
> From Faery court, where I haue many a day  
> Serued a gentle Lady of great sway,  
> And high accompt throughout all Elfin land,  
> Who lately left the same, and tooke this way:  
> Her now I seeke, and if ye vnderstand  
> Which way she fared hath, good Sir tell out of hand.
>
> What mister wight (said he) and how arayd?  
> Royally clad (quoth he) in cloth of gold,  
> As meetest may beseeme a noble mayd;  
> Her faire lockes in rich circlet be enrold,  
> A fairer wight did neuer Sunne behold,  
> And on a Palfrey rides more white then snow,  
> Yet she her selfe is whiter manifold:  
> The surest signe, whereby ye may her know,  
> Is, that she is the fairest wight aliue, I trow.
>
> Now certes swaine (said he) such one I weene,  
> Fast flying through this forest from her fo,  
> A foule ill fauoured foster, I haue seene;  
> Her selfe, well as I might, I reskewd tho,  
> But could not stay; so fast she did foregoe,  
> Carried away with wings of speedy feare.  
> Ah dearest God (quoth he) that is great woe,  
> And wondrous ruth to all, that shall it heare.  
> But can ye read Sir, how I may her find, or where.
>
> Perdy me leuer were to weeten that,  
> (Said he) then ransome of the richest knight,  
> Or all the good that euer yet I gat:  
> But froward fortune, and too forward Night  
> Such happinesse did, maulgre, to me spight,  
> And fro me reft both life and light attone.  
> But Dwarfe aread, what is that Lady bright,  
> That through this forest wandreth thus alone;  
> For of her errour straunge I haue great ruth and mone.
>
> That Lady is (quoth he) where so she bee,  
> The bountiest virgin, and most debonaire,  
> That euer liuing eye I weene did see;  
> Liues none this day, that may with her compare  
> In stedfast chastitie and vertue rare,  
> The goodly ornaments of beautie bright;  
> And is ycleped *Florimell* the faire,  
> Faire *Florimell* belou'd of many a knight,  
> Yet she loues none but one, that *Marinell* is hight.
>
> A Sea-nymphes sonne, that *Marinell* is hight,  
> Of my deare Dame is loued dearely well;  
> In other none, but him, she sets delight,  
> All her delight is set on *Marinell*;  
> But he sets nought at all by *Florimell*:  
> For Ladies loue his mother long ygoe  
> Did him, they say, forwarne through sacred spell.  
> But fame now flies, that of a forreine foe  
> He is yslaine, which is the ground of all our woe.
>
> Fiue dayes there be, since he (they say) was slaine,  
> And foure, since *Florimell* the Court for-went,  
> And vowed neuer to returne againe,  
> Till him aliue or dead she did inuent.  
> Therefore, faire Sir, for loue of knighthood gent,  
> And honour of trew Ladies, if ye may  
> By your good counsell, or bold hardiment,  
> Or succour her, or me direct the way;  
> Do one, or other good, I you most humbly pray.
>
> So may ye gaine to you full great renowme,  
> Of all good Ladies through the world so wide,  
> And haply in her hart find highest rowme,  
> Of whom ye seeke to be most magnifide:  
> At least eternall meede shall you abide.  
> To whom the Prince; Dwarfe, comfort to thee take,  
> For till thou tidings learne, what her betide,  
> I here auow thee neuer to forsake.  
> Ill weares he armes, that nill them vse for Ladies sake.
>
> So with the Dwarfe he backe return'd againe,  
> To seeke his Lady, where he mote her find;  
> But by the way he greatly gan complaine  
> The want of his good Squire late left behind,  
> For whom he wondrous pensiue grew in mind,  
> For doubt of daunger, which mote him betide;  
> For him he loued aboue all mankind,  
> Hauing him trew and faithfull euer tride,  
> And bold, as euer Squire that waited by knights side.
>
> Who all this while full hardly was assayd  
> Of deadly daunger, which to him betid;  
> For whiles his Lord pursewd that noble Mayd,  
> After that foster fowle he fiercely rid,  
> To bene auenged of the shame, he did  
> To that faire Damzell: Him he chaced long  
> Through the thicke woods, wherein he would haue hid  
> His shamefull head from his auengement strong.  
> And oft him threatned death for his outrageous wrong.
>
> Nathlesse the villen sped him selfe so well,  
> Whether through swiftnesse of his speedy beast,  
> Or knowledge of those woods, where he did dwell,  
> That shortly he from daunger was releast,  
> And out of sight escaped at the least;  
> Yet not escaped from the dew reward  
> Of his bad deeds, which dayly he increast,  
> Ne ceased not, till him oppressed hard  
> The heauy plague, that for such leachours is prepard.
>
> For soone as he was vanisht out of sight,  
> His coward courage gan emboldned bee,  
> And cast t'auenge him of that fowle despight,  
> Which he had borne of his bold enimee.  
> Tho to his brethren came: for they were three  
> Vngratious children of one gracelesse sire,  
> And vnto them complained, how that he  
> Had vsed bene of that foolehardy Squire;  
> So them with bitter words he stird to bloudy ire.
>
> Forthwith themselues with their sad instruments  
> Of spoyle and murder they gan arme byliue,  
> And with him forth into the forest went,  
> To wreake the wrath, which he did earst reuiue  
> In their sterne brests, on him which late did driue  
> Their brother to reproch and shamefull flight:  
> For they had vow'd, that neuer he aliue  
> Out of that forest should escape their might;  
> Vile rancour their rude harts had fild with such despight.
>
> Within that wood there was a couert glade,  
> Foreby a narrow foord, to them well knowne,  
> Through which it was vneath for wight to wade;  
> And now by fortune it was ouerflowne:  
> By that same way they knew that Squire vnknowne  
> Mote algates passe; for thy, themselues they set  
> There in await, with thicke woods ouer growne,  
> And all the while their malice they did whet  
> With cruell threats, his passage through the ford to let.
>
> It fortuned, as they deuized had,  
> The gentle Squire came ryding that same way,  
> Vnweeting of their wile and treason bad,  
> And through the ford to passen did assay;  
> But that fierce foster, which late fled away,  
> Stoutly forth stepping on the further shore,  
> Him boldly bad his passage there to stay,  
> Till he had made amends, and full restore  
> For all the damage, which he had him doen afore.
>
> With that at him a quiu'ring dart he threw,  
> With so fell force and villeinous despighte,  
> That through his haberieon the forkehead flew,  
> And through the linked mayles empierced quite,  
> But had no powre in his soft flesh to bite:  
> That stroke the hardy Squire did sore displease,  
> But more that him he could not come to smite;  
> For by no meanes the high banke he could sease,  
> But labour'd long in that deepe ford with vaine disease.
>
> And still the foster with his long bore-speare  
> Him kept from landing at his wished will;  
> Anone one sent out of the thicket neare  
> A cruell shaft, headed with deadly ill,  
> And fethered with an vnlucky quill;  
> The wicked steele stayd not, till it did light  
> In his left thigh, and deepely did it thrill:  
> Exceeding griefe that wound in him empight,  
> But more that with his foes he could not come to fight.
>
> At last through wrath and vengeaunce making way,  
> He on the bancke arriu'd with mickle paine,  
> Where the third brother him did sore assay,  
> And droue at him with all his might and maine  
> A forrest bill, which both his hands did straine;  
> But warily he did auoide the blow,  
> And with his speare requited him againe,  
> That both his sides were thrilled with the throw,  
> And a large streame of bloud out of the wound did flow.
>
> He tombling downe, with gnashing teeth did bite  
> The bitter earth, and bad to let him in  
> Into the balefull house of endlesse night,  
> Where wicked ghosts do waile their former sin.  
> Tho gan the battell freshly to begin;  
> For nathemore for that spectacle bad,  
> Did th'other two their cruell vengeaunce blin,  
> But both attonce on both sides him bestad,  
> And load vpon him layd, his life for to haue had.
>
> Tho when that villain he auiz'd, which late  
> Affrighted had the fairest *Florimell*,  
> Full of fiers fury, and indignant hate,  
> To him he turned, and with rigour fell  
> Smote him so rudely on the Pannikell,  
> That to the chin he cleft his head in twaine:  
> Downe on the ground his carkas groueling fell;  
> His sinfull soule with desperate disdaine,  
> Out of her fleshly ferme fled to the place of paine.
>
> That seeing now the onely last of three,  
> Who with that wicked shaft him wounded had,  
> Trembling with horrour, as that did foresee  
> The fearefull end of his auengement sad,  
> Through which he follow should his brethren bad,  
> His bootelesse bow in feeble hand vpcaught,  
> And therewith shot an arrow at the lad;  
> Which faintly fluttring, scarce his helmet raught,  
> And glauncing fell to ground, but him annoyed naught.
>
> With that he would haue fled into the wood;  
> But *Timias* him lightly ouerhent,  
> Right as he entring was into the flood,  
> And strooke at him with force so violent,  
> That headlesse him into the foord he sent:  
> The carkas with the streame was carried downe,  
> But th'head fell backeward on the continent.  
> So mischief fel vpon the meaners crowne;  
> They three be dead with shame, the Squire liues with renowne.
>
> He liues, but takes small ioy of his renowne;  
> For of that cruell wound he bled so sore,  
> That from his steed he fell in deadly swowne;  
> Yet still the bloud forth gusht in so great store,  
> That he lay wallowd all in his owne gore.  
> Now God thee keepe, thou gentlest Squire aliue,  
> Else shall thy louing Lord thee see no more,  
> But both of comfort him thou shalt depriue,  
> And eke thy selfe of honour, which thou didst atchiue.
>
> Prouidence heauenly passeth liuing thought,  
> And doth for wretched mens reliefe make way;  
> For loe great grace or fortune thither brought  
> Comfort to him, that comfortlesse now lay.  
> In those same woods, ye well remember may,  
> How that a noble hunteresse did wonne,  
> She, that base *Braggadochio* did affray,  
> And made him fast out of the forrest runne;  
> *Belphoebe* was her name, as faire as *Phoebus* sunne.
>
> She on a day, as she pursewd the chace  
> Of some wild beast, which with her arrowes keene  
> She wounded had, the same along did trace  
> By tract of bloud, which she had freshly seene,  
> To haue besprinckled all the grassy greene;  
> By the great persue, which she there perceau'd,  
> Well hoped she the beast engor'd had beene,  
> And made more hast, the life to haue bereau'd:  
> But ah, her expectation greatly was deceau'd.
>
> Shortly she came, whereas that woefull Squire  
> With bloud deformed, lay in deadly swownd:  
> In whose faire eyes, like lamps of quenched fire,  
> The Christall humour stood congealed rownd;  
> His locks, like faded leaues fallen to grownd,  
> Knotted with bloud, in bounches rudely ran,  
> And his sweete lips, on which before that stownd  
> The bud of youth to blossome faire began,  
> Spoild of their rosie red, were woxen pale and wan.
>
> Saw neuer liuing eye more heauy sight,  
> That could haue made a rocke of stone to rew,  
> Or riue in twaine: which when that Lady bright  
> Besides all hope with melting eyes did vew,  
> All suddeinly abasht she chaunged hew,  
> And with sterne horrour backward gan to start:  
> But when she better him beheld, she grew  
> Full of soft passion and vnwonted smart:  
> The point of pitty perced through her tender hart.
>
> Meekely she bowed downe, to weete if life  
> Yet in his frosen members did remaine,  
> And feeling by his pulses beating rife,  
> That the weake soule her seat did yet retaine,  
> She cast to comfort him with busie paine:  
> His double folded necke she reard vpright,  
> And rubd his temples, and each trembling vaine;  
> His mayled haberieon she did vndight,  
> And from his head his heauy burganet did light.
>
> Into the woods thenceforth in hast she went,  
> To seeke for hearbes, that mote him remedy;  
> For she of hearbes had great intendiment,  
> Taught of the Nymphe, which from her infancy  
> Her nourced had in trew Nobility:  
> There, whether it diuine *Tobacco* were,  
> Or *Panachæa*, or *Polygony*,  
> She found, and brought it to her patient deare  
> Who al this while lay bleeding out his hart-bloud neare.
>
> The soueraigne weede betwixt two marbles plaine  
> She pownded small, and did in peeces bruze,  
> And then atweene her lilly handes twaine,  
> Into his wound the iuyce thereof did scruze,  
> And round about, as she could well it vze,  
> The flesh therewith she suppled and did steepe,  
> T'abate all spasme, and soke the swelling bruze,  
> And after hauing searcht the intuse deepe,  
> She with her scarfe did bind the wound frõ cold to keepe.
>
> By this he had sweete life recur'd againe,  
> And groning inly deepe, at last his eyes,  
> His watry eyes, drizling like deawy raine,  
> He vp gan lift toward the azure skies,  
> From whence descend all hopelesse remedies:  
> Therewith he sigh'd, and turning him aside,  
> The goodly Mayd full of diuinities,  
> And gifts of heauenly grace he by him spide,  
> Her bow and gilden quiuer lying him beside.
>
> Mercy deare Lord (said he) what grace is this,  
> That thou hast shewed to me sinfull wight,  
> To send thine Angell from her bowre of blis,  
> To comfort me in my distressed plight?  
> Angell, or Goddesse do I call thee right?  
> What seruice may I do vnto thee meete,  
> That hast from darkenesse me returnd to light,  
> And with thy heauenly salues and med'cines sweete,  
> Hast drest my sinfull wounds? I kisse thy blessed feete.
>
> Thereat she blushing said, Ah gentle Squire,  
> Nor Goddesse I, nor Angell, but the Mayd,  
> And daughter of a woody Nymphe, desire  
> No seruice, bu tthy safety and ayd;  
> Which if thou gaine, I shalbe well apayd.  
> We mortall wights, whose liues and fortunes bee  
> To commun accidents still open layd,  
> Are bound with commun bond of frailtee,  
> To succour wretched wights, whom we captiued see.
>
> By this her Damzels, which the former chace  
> Had vndertaken after her, arriu'd,  
> As did *Belphoebe*, in the bloudy place,  
> And thereby deemd the beast had bene depriu'd  
> Of life, whom late their Ladies arrow ryu'd:  
> For thy, the bloudy tract they follow fast,  
> And euery one to runne the swiftest stryu'd;  
> But two of them the rest far ouerpast,  
> And where their Lady was, arriued at the last.
>
> Where when they saw that goodly boy, with blood  
> Defowled, and their Lady dresse his wownd,  
> They wondred much, and shortly vnderstood,  
> How him in deadly case their Lady fownd,  
> And reskewed out of the heauy stownd.  
> Eftsoones his warlike courser, which was strayd  
> Farre in the woods, whiles that he lay in swownd,  
> She made those Damzels search, which being stayd,  
> They did him set thereon, and forthwith them conuayd.
>
> Into that forest farre they thence him led,  
> Where was their dwelling, in a pleasant glade,  
> With mountaines round about enuironed,  
> And mighty woods, which did the valley shade,  
> And like a stately Theatre it made,  
> Spreading it selfe into a spatious plaine.  
> And in the midst a little riuer plaide  
> Emongst the pumy stones, which seemd to plaine  
> With gentle murmure, that his course they did restraine.
>
> Beside the same a dainty place there lay,  
> Planted with mirtle trees and laurels greene,  
> In which the birds song many a louely lay  
> Of gods high prayse, and of their loues sweet teene,  
> As it an earthly Paradize had beene:  
> In whose enclosed shadow there was pight  
> A faire Pauilion, scarcely to be seene,  
> The which was all within most richly dight,  
> That greatest Princes liuing it mote well delight.
>
> Thither they brought that wounded Squire, and layd  
> In easie couch his feeble limbes to rest,  
> He rested him a while, and then the Mayd  
> His ready wound with better salues new drest;  
> Dayly she dressed him, and did the best  
> His grieuous hurt to garish, that she might,  
> That shortly she his dolour hath redrest,  
> And his foule sore reduced to faire plight:  
> It she reduced, but himselfe destroyed quight.
>
> O foolish Physick, and vnfruitfull paine,  
> That heales vp one and makes another wound:  
> She his hurt thigh to him recur'd againe,  
> But hurt his hart, the which before was sound,  
> Through an vnwary dart, which did rebound  
> From her faire eyes and gracious countenaunce.  
> What bootes it him from death to be vnbound,  
> To be captiued in endlesse duraunce  
> Of sorrow and despaire without aleggeaunce?
>
> Still as his wound did gather, and grow hole,  
> So still his hart woxe sore, and health decayd:  
> Madnesse to saue a part, and lose the whole.  
> Still whenas he beheld the heauenly Mayd,  
> Whiles dayly plaisters to his wound she layd,  
> So still his Malady the more increast,  
> The whiles her matchlesse beautie him dismayd.  
> Ah God, what other could he do at least,  
> But loue so faire a Lady, that his life releast?
>
> Long while he stroue in his courageous brest,  
> With reason dew the passion to subdew,  
> And loue for to dislodge out of his nest:  
> Still when her excellencies he did vew,  
> Her soueraigne bounty, and celestiall hew,  
> The same to loue he strongly was constraind:  
> But when his meane estate he did reuew,  
> He from such hardy boldnesse was restraind,  
> And of his lucklesse lot and cruell loue thus plaind.
>
> Vnthankfull wretch (said he) is this the meed,  
> With which her soueraigne mercy thou doest quight?  
> Thy life she saued by her gracious deed,  
> But thou doest weene with villeinous despight,  
> To blot her honour, and her heauenly light.  
> Dye rather, dye, then so disloyally  
> Deeme of her high desert, or seeme so light:  
> Faire death it is to shonne more shame, to dy:  
> Dye rather, dy, then euer loue disloyally.
>
> But if to loue disloyalty it bee,  
> Shall I then hate her, that from deathes dore  
> Me brought? ah farre be such reproch fro mee.  
> What can I lesse do, then her loue therefore,  
> Sith I her dew reward cannot restore:  
> Dye rather, dye, and dying do her serue,  
> Dying her serue, and liuing her adore;  
> Thy life she gaue, thy life she doth deserue:  
> Dye rather, dye, then euer from her seruice swerue.
>
> But foolish boy, what bootes thy seruice bace  
> To her, to whom the heauens do serue and sew?  
> Thou a meane Squire, of meeke and lowly place,  
> She heauenly borne, and of celestiall hew.  
> How then? of all loue taketh equall vew:  
> And doth not highest God vouchsafe to take  
> The loue and seruice of the basest crew?  
> If she will not, dye meekly for her sake;  
> Dye rather, dye, then euer so faire loue forsake.
>
> Thus warreid he long time against his will,  
> Till that through weaknesse he was forst at last,  
> To yield himselfe vnto the mighty ill:  
> Which as a victour proud, gan ransack fast  
> His inward parts, and all his entrayles wast,  
> That neither bloud in face, nor life in hart  
> It left, but both did quite drye vp, and blast;  
> As percing leuin, which the inner part

> Which seeing faire *Belphoebe*, gan to feare,  
> Least that his wound were inly well not healed,  
> Or that the wicked steele empoysned were:  
> Litle she weend, that loue he close concealed;  
> Yet still he wasted, as the snow congealed,  
> When the bright sunne his beams thereon doth beat;  
> Yet neuer he his hart to her reuealed,  
> But rather chose to dye for sorrow great,  
> Then with dishonorable termes her to entreat.
>
> She gracious Lady, yet no paines did spare,  
> To do him ease, or do him remedy:  
> Many Restoratiues of vertues rare,

> A loue-sick hart, she did to him enuy;

> She did enuy that soueraigne salue, in secret store.
>
> That dainty Rose, the daughter of her Morne,  
> More deare then life she tendered, whose flowre  
> The girlond of her honour did adorne:  
> Ne suffred she the Middayes scorching powre,  
> Ne the sharp Northerne wind thereon to showre,  
> But lapped vp her silken leaues most chaire,  
> When so the froward skye began to lowre:  
> But soone as calmed was the Christall aire,  
> She did it faire dispred, and let to florish faire.
>
> Eternall God in his almighty powre,  
> To make ensample of his heauenly grace,  
> In Paradize whilome did plant this flowre,

> That Ladies all may follow her ensample dead.
>
> In so great prayse of stedfast chastity,  
> Nathlesse she was so curteous and kind,  
> Tempred with grace, and goodly modesty,  
> That seemed those two vertues stroue to find  
> The higher place in her Heroick mind:  
> So striuing each did other more augment,  
> And both encreast the prayse of woman kind,  
> And both encreast her beautie excellent;  
> So all did make in her a perfect complement.
