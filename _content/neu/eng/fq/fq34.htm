<i>The Witch creates a snowy Lady,<br>
Like to Florimell,<br>
Who wrongd by Carle by Proteus sau'd,<br>
Is sought by Paridell.</i><p>

<blockquote>
S
O oft as I this history record,<br>
My hart doth melt with meere compassion,<br>
To thinke, how causelesse of her owne accord<br>
This gentle Damzell, whom I wrote vpon,<br>
Should plonged be in such affliction,<br>
Without all hope of comfort or reliefe,<br>
That sure I weene, the hardest hart of stone,<br>
Would hardly find to aggrauate her griefe;<br>
For misery craues rather mercie, then repriefe.<p>

But that accursed Hag, her hostesse late,<br>
Had so enranckled her malitious hart,<br>
That she desyrd th'abridgement of her fate,<br>
Or long enlargement of her painefull smart.<br>
Now when the Beast, which by her wicked art<br>
Late forth she sent, she backe returning spyde,<br>
Tyde with her broken girdle, it a part<br>
Of her rich spoyles, whom he had earst destroyd,<br>
She weend, and wondrous gladnesse to her hart applyde.<p>

And with it running hast'ly to her sonne,<br>
Thought with that sight him much to haue reliued;<br>
Who thereby deeming sure the thing as donne,<br>
His former griefe with furie fresh reuiued,<br>
Much more then earst, and would haue algates riued<br>
The hart out of his brest: for sith her ded<br>
He surely dempt, himselfe he thought depriued<br>
Quite of all hope, wherewith he long had fed<br>
His foolish maladie, and long time had misled.<p>

With thought whereof, exceeding mad he grew,<br>
And in his rage his mother would haue slaine,<br>
Had she not fled into a secret mew,<br>
Where she was wont her Sprights to entertaine<br>
The maisters of her art: there was she faine<br>
To call them all in order to her ayde,<br>
And them coniure vpon eternall paine,<br>
To counsell her so carefully dismayd,<br>
How she might heale her sonne, whose senses were decayd.<p>

By their aduise, and her owne wicked wit,<br>
She there deuiz'd a wondrous worke to frame,<br>
Whose like on earth was neuer framed yit,<br>
That euen Nature selfe enuide the same,<br>
And grudg'd to see the counterfet should shame<br>
The thing it selfe.  In hand she boldly tooke<br>
To make another like the former Dame,<br>
Another <i>Florimell</i>, in shape and looke<br>
So liuely and so like, that many it mistooke.<p>

The substance, whereof she the bodie made,<br>
Was purest snow in massie mould congeald,<br>
Which she had gathered in a shadie glade<br>
Of the <i>Riphoean</i> hils, to her reueald<br>
By errant Sprights, but from all men conceald:<br>
The same she tempred with fine Mercury,<br>
And virgin wex, that neuer yet was seald,<br>
And mingled them with perfect vermily,<br>
That like a liuely sanguine it seem'd to the eye.<p>

In stead of eyes two burning lampes she set<br>
In siluer sockets, shyning like the skyes,<br>
And a quicke mouing Spirit did arret<br>
To stirre and roll them, like a womans eyes;<br>
In stead of yellow lockes she did deuise,<br>
With golden wyre to weaue her curled head;<br>
Yet golden wyre was not so yellow thrise<br>
As <i>Florimells</i> faire haire: and in the stead<br>
Of life, she put a Spright to rule the carkasse dead.<p>

A wicked Spright yfraught with fawning guile,<br>
And faire resemblance aboue all the rest,<br>
Which with the Prince of Darknesse fell somewhile,<br>
From heauens blisse and euerlasting rest;<br>
Him needed not instruct, which way were best<br>
Himselfe to fashion likest <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
Ne how to speake, ne how to vse his gest,<br>
For he in counterfeisance did excell,<br>
And all the wyles of wemens wits knew passing well.<p>

Him shaped thus, she deckt in garments gay,<br>
Which <i>Florimell</i> had left behind her late,<br>
That who so then her saw, would surely say,<br>
It was her selfe, whom it did imitate,<br>
Or fairer then her selfe, if ought algate<br>
Might fairer be.  And then she forth her brought<br>
Vnto her sonne, that lay in feeble state;<br>
Who seeing her gan streight vpstart, and thought<br>
She was the Lady selfe, whom he so long had sought.<p>

Tho fast her clipping twixt his armes twaine,<br>
Extremely ioyed in so happie sight,<br>
And soone forgot his former sickly paine;<br>
But she, the more to seeme such as she hight,<br>
Coyly rebutted his embracement light;<br>
Yet still with gentle countenaunce retained,<br>
Enough to hold a foole in vaine delight:<br>
Him long she so with shadowes entertained,<br>
As her Creatresse had in charge to her ordained.<p>

Till on a day, as he disposed was<br>
To walke the woods with that his Idole faire,<br>
Her to disport, and idle time to pas,<br>
In th'open freshnesse of the gentle aire,<br>
A knight that way there chaunced to repaire;<br>
Yet knight he was not, but a boastfull swaine,<br>
That deedes of armes had euer in despaire,<br>
Proud <i>Braggadocchio</i>, that in vaunting vaine<br>
His glory did repose, and credit did maintaine.<p>

He seeing with that Chorle so faire a wight,<br>
Decked with many a costly ornament,<br>
Much merueiled thereat, as well he might,<br>
And thought that match a fowle disparagement:<br>
His bloudie speare eftsoones he boldly bent<br>
Against the silly clowne, who dead through feare,<br>
Fell streight to ground in great astonishment;<br>
Villein (said he) this Ladie is my deare,<br>
Dy, if thou it gainesay: I will away her beare.<p>

The fearefull Chorle durst not gainesay, nor doe,<br>
But trembling stood, and yielded him the pray;<br>
Who finding litle leasure her to wooe,<br>
On <i>Tromparts</i> steed her mounted without stay,<br>
And without reskew led her quite away.<br>
Proud man himselfe then <i>Braggadocchio</i> deemed,<br>
And next to none, after that happie day,<br>
Being possessed of that spoyle, which seemed<br>
The fairest wight on ground, and most of men esteemed.<p>

But when he saw himselfe free from poursute,<br>
He gan make gentle purpose to his Dame,<br>
With termes of loue and lewdnesse dissolute;<br>
For he could well his glozing speaches frame<br>
To such vaine vses, that him best became:<br>
But she thereto would lend but light regard,<br>
As seeming sory, that she euer came<br>
Into his powre, that vsed her so hard,<br>
To reaue her honor, which she more then life prefard.<p>

Thus as they two of kindnesse treated long,<br>
There them by chaunce encountred on the way<br>
An armed knight, vpon a courser strong,<br>
Whose trampling feet vpon the hollow lay<br>
Seemed to thunder, and did nigh affray<br>
That Capons courage: yet he looked grim,<br>
And fain'd to cheare his Ladie in dismay;<br>
Who seem'd for feare to quake in euery lim,<br>
And her to saue from outrage, meekely prayed him.<p>

Fiercely that stranger forward came, and nigh<br>
Approching, with bold words and bitter threat,<br>
Bad that same boaster, as he mote, on high<br>
To leaue to him that Lady for excheat,<br>
Or bide him battell without further treat.<br>
That challenge did too peremptory seeme,<br>
And fild his senses with abashment great;<br>
Yet seeing nigh him ieopardy extreme,<br>
He it dissembled well, and light seem'd to esteeme.<p>

Saying, Thou foolish knight, that weenst with words<br>
To steale away, that I with blowes haue wonne,<br>
And brought through points of many perilous swords:<br>
But if thee list to see thy Courser ronne,<br>
Or proue thy selfe, this sad encounter shonne,<br>
And seeke else without hazard of thy hed.<br>
At those proud words that other knight begonne<br>
To wexe exceeding wroth, and him ared<br>
To turne his steede about, or sure he should be ded.<p>

Sith then (said <i>Braggadocchio</i>) needes thou wilt<br>
Thy dayes abridge, through proofe of puissance,<br>
Turne we our steedes, that both in equall tilt<br>
May meet againe, and each take happie chance.<br>
This said, they both a furlongs mountenance<br>
Retyrd their steeds, to ronne in euen race:<br>
But <i>Braggadocchio</i> with his bloudie lance<br>
Once hauing turnd, no more returnd his face,<br>
But left his loue to losse, and fled himselfe apace.<p>

The knight him seeing fly, had no regard<br>
Him to poursew, but to the Ladie rode,<br>
And hauing her from <i>Trompart</i> lightly reard,<br>
Vpon his Courser set the louely lode,<br>
And with her fled away without abode.<br>
Well weened he, that fairest <i>Florimell</i><br>
It was, with whom in company he yode,<br>
And so her selfe did alwaies to him tell;<br>
So made him thinke him selfe in heauen, that was in hell.<p>

But <i>Florimell</i> her selfe was farre away,<br>
Driuen to great distresse by Fortune straunge,<br>
And taught the carefull Mariner to play,<br>
Sith late mischaunce had her compeld to chaunge<br>
The land for sea, at randon there to raunge:<br>
Yet there that cruell Queene auengeresse,<br>
Not satisfide so farre her to estraunge<br>
From courtly blisse and wonted happinesse,<br>
Did heape on her new waues of weary wretchednesse.<p>

For being fled into the fishers bote,<br>
For refuge from the Monsters crueltie,<br>
Long so she on the mightie maine did flote,<br>
And with the tide droue forward careleslie;<br>
For th'aire was milde, and cleared was the skie,<br>
And all his windes <i>Dan Aeolus</i> did keepe,<br>
From stirring vp their stormy enmitie,<br>
As pittying to see her waile and weepe;<br>
But all the while the fisher did securely sleepe.<p>

At last when droncke with drowsinesse, he woke,<br>
And saw his drouer driue along the streame,<br>
He was dismayd, and thrise his breast he stroke,<br>
For maruell of that accident extreame;<br>
But when he saw that blazing beauties beame,<br>
Which with rare light his bote did beautifie,<br>
He marueild more, and thought he yet did dreame<br>
Not well awakt, or that some extasie<br>
Assotted had his sense, or dazed was his eie.<p>

But when her well auizing, he perceiued<br>
To be no vision, nor fantasticke sight,<br>
Great comfort of her presence he conceiued,<br>
And felt in his old courage new delight<br>
To gin awake, and stirre his frozen spright:<br>
Tho rudely askt her, how she thither came.<br>
Ah (said she) father, I note read aright,<br>
What hard misfortune brought me to the same;<br>
Yet am I glad that here I now in safety am.<p>

But thou good man, sith farre in sea we bee,<br>
And the great waters gin apace to swell,<br>
That now no more we can the maine-land see,<br>
Haue care, I pray, to guide the cock-bote well,<br>
Least worse on sea then vs on land befell.<br>
Thereat th'old man did nought but fondly grin,<br>
And said, his boat the way could wisely tell:<br>
But his deceiptfull eyes did neuer lin,<br>
To looke on her faire face, and marke her snowy skin.<p>

The sight whereof in his congealed flesh,<br>
Infixt such secret sting of greedy lust,<br>
That the drie withered stocke it gan refresh,<br>
And kindled heat, that soone in flame forth brust:<br>
The driest wood is soonest burnt to dust.<br>
Rudely to her he lept, and his rough hand<br>
Where ill became him, rashly would haue thrust,<br>
But she with angry scorne him did withstond,<br>
And shamefully reproued for his rudenesse fond.<p>

But he, that neuer good nor maners knew,<br>
Her sharpe rebuke full litle did esteeme;<br>
Hard is to teach an old horse amble trew.<br>
The inward smoke, that did before but steeme,<br>
Broke into open fire and rage extreme,<br>
And now he strength gan adde vnto his will,<br>
Forcing to doe, that did him fowle misseeme:<br>
Beastly he threw her downe, ne car'd to spill<br>
Her garments gay with scales of fish, that all did fill.<p>

The silly virgin stroue him to withstand,<br>
All that she might, and him in vaine reuild:<br>
She struggled strongly both with foot and hand,<br>
To saue her honor from that villaine vild,<br>
And cride to heauen, from humane helpe exild.<br>
O ye braue knights, that boast this Ladies loue,<br>
Where be ye now, when she is nigh defild<br>
Of filthy wretch? well may shee you reproue<br>
Of falshood or of slouth, when most it may behoue.<p>

But if that thou, Sir <i>Satyran</i>, didst weete,<br>
Or thou, Sir <i>Peridure</i>, her sorie state,<br>
How soone would yee assemble many a fleete,<br>
To fetch from sea, that ye at land lost late;<br>
Towres, Cities, Kingdomes ye would ruinate,<br>
In your auengement and dispiteous rage,<br>
Ne ought your burning fury mote abate;<br>
But if Sir <i>Calidore</i> could it presage,<br>
No liuing creature could his cruelty asswage.<p>

But sith that none of all her knights is nye,<br>
See how the heauens of voluntary grace,<br>
And soueraine fauour towards chastity,<br>
Doe succour send to her distressed cace:<br>
So much high God doth innocence embrace.<br>
It fortuned, whilest thus she stifly stroue,<br>
And the wide sea importuned long space<br>
With shrilling shriekes, <i>Proteus</i> abroad did roue,<br>
Along the fomy waues driuing his finny droue.<p>

<i>Proteus</i> is Shepheard of the seas of yore,<br>
And hath the charge of <i>Neptunes</i> mightie heard;<br>
An aged sire with head all frory hore,<br>
And sprinckled frost vpon his deawy beard:<br>
Who when those pittifull outcries he heard,<br>
Through all the seas so ruefully resound,<br>
His charet swift in haste he thither steard,<br>
Which with a teeme of scaly <i>Phocas</i> bound<br>
Was drawne vpon the waues, that fomed him around.<p>

And comming to that Fishers wandring bote,<br>
That went at will, withouten carde or sayle,<br>
He therein saw that yrkesome sight, which smote<br>
Deepe indignation and compassion frayle<br>
Into his hart attonce: streight did he hayle<br>
The greedy villein from his hoped pray,<br>
Of which he now did very litle fayle,<br>
And with his staffe, that driues his Heard astray,<br>
Him bet so sore, that life and sense did much dismay.<p>

The whiles the pitteous Ladie vp did ryse,<br>
Ruffled and fowly raid with filthy soyle,<br>
And blubbred face with teares of her faire eyes:<br>
Her heart nigh broken was with weary toyle,<br>
To saue her selfe from that outrageous spoyle,<br>
But when she looked vp, to weet, what wight<br>
Had her from so infamous fact assoyld,<br>
For shame, but more for feare of his grim sight,<br>
Downe in her lap she hid her face, and loudly shright.<p>

Her selfe not saued yet from daunger dred<br>
She thought, but chaung'd from one to other feare;<br>
Like as a fearefull Partridge, that is fled<br>
From the sharpe Hauke, which her attached neare,<br>
And fals to ground, to seeke for succour theare,<br>
Whereas the hungry Spaniels she does spy,<br>
With greedy iawes her readie for to teare;<br>
In such distresse and sad perplexity<br>
Was <i>Florimell</i>, when <i>Proteus</i> she did see thereby.<p>

But he endeuoured with speeches milde<br>
Her to recomfort, and accourage bold,<br>
Bidding her feare no more her foeman vilde,<br>
Nor doubt himselfe; and who he was, her told.<br>
Yet all that could not from affright her hold,<br>
Ne to recomfort her at all preuayld;<br>
For her faint heart was with the frozen cold<br>
Benumbd so inly, that her wits nigh fayld,<br>
And all her senses with abashment quite were quayld.<p>

Her vp betwixt his rugged hands he reard,<br>
And with his frory lips full softly kist,<br>
Whiles the cold ysickles from his rough beard,<br>
Dropped adowne vpon her yuorie brest:<br>
Yet he himselfe so busily addrest,<br>
That her out of astonishment he wrought,<br>
And out of that same fishers filthy nest<br>
Remouing her, into his charet brought,<br>
And there with many gentle termes her faire besought.<p>

But that old leachour, which with bold assault<br>
That beautie durst presume to violate,<br>
He cast to punish for his hainous fault;<br>
Then tooke he him yet trembling sith of late,<br>
And tyde behind his charet, to aggrate<br>
The virgin, whom he had abusde so sore:<br>
So drag'd him through the waues in scornefull state,<br>
And after cast him vp, vpon the shore;<br>
But <i>Florimell</i> with him vnto his bowre he bore.<p>

His bowre is in the bottome of the maine,<br>
Vnder a mightie rocke, gainst which do raue<br>
The roaring billowes in their proud disdaine,<br>
That with the angry working of the waue,<br>
Therein is eaten out an hollow caue,<br>
That seemes rough Masons hand with engines keene<br>
Had long while laboured it to engraue:<br>
There was his wonne, ne liuing wight was seene,<br>
Saue one old <i>Nymph</i>, hight <i>Panope</i> to keepe it cleane.<p>

Thither he brought the sory <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
And entertained her the best he might<br>
And <i>Panope</i> her entertaind eke well,<br>
As an immortall mote a mortall wight,<br>
To winne her liking vnto his delight:<br>
With flattering words he sweetly wooed her,<br>
And offered faire gifts t'allure her sight,<br>
But she both offers and the offerer<br>
Despysde, and all the fawning of the flatterer.<p>

Daily he tempted her with this or that,<br>
And neuer suffred her to be at rest:<br>
But euermore she him refused flat,<br>
And all his fained kindnesse did detest.<br>
So firmely she had sealed vp her brest.<br>
Sometimes he boasted, that a God he hight:<br>
But she a mortall creature loued best:<br>
Then he would make himselfe a mortall wight;<br>
But then she said she lou'd none, but a Faerie knight.<p>

Then like a Faerie knight himselfe he drest;<br>
For euery shape on him he could endew:<br>
Then like a king he was to her exprest,<br>
And offred kingdomes vnto her in vew,<br>
To be his Leman and his Ladie trew:<br>
But when all this he nothing saw preuaile,<br>
With harder meanes he cast her to subdew,<br>
And with sharpe threates her often did assaile,<br>
So thinking for to make her stubborne courage quaile.<p>

To dreadfull shapes he did himselfe transforme,<br>
Now like a Gyant, now like to a feend,<br>
Then like a Centaure, then like to a storme,<br>
Raging within the waues: thereby he weend<br>
Her will to win vnto his wished end.<br>
But when with feare, nor fauour, nor with all<br>
He else could doe, he saw himselfe esteemd,<br>
Downe in a Dongeon deepe he let her fall,<br>
And threatned there to make her his eternall thrall.<p>

Eternall thraldome was to her more liefe,<br>
Then losse of chastitie, or chaunge of loue:<br>
Die had she rather in tormenting griefe,<br>
Then any should of falsenesse her reproue,<br>
Or loosenesse, that she lightly did remoue.<br>
Most vertuous virgin, glory be thy meed,<br>
And crowne of heauenly praise with Saints aboue,<br>
Where most sweet hymmes of this thy famous deed<br>
Are still emongst them song, that far my rymes exceed.<p>

Fit song of Angels caroled to bee;<br>
But yet what so my feeble Muse can frame,<br>
Shall be t'aduance thy goodly chastitee,<br>
And to enroll thy memorable name,<br>
In th'heart of euery honourable Dame,<br>
That they thy vertuous deedes may imitate,<br>
And be partakers of thy endlesse fame.<br>
It yrkes me, leaue thee in this wofull state,<br>
To tell of <i>Satyrane</i>, where I him left of late.<p>

Who hauing ended with that <i>Squire of Dames</i><br>
A long discourse of his aduentures vaine,<br>
The which himselfe, then Ladies more defames,<br>
And finding not th'<i>Hyena</i> to be slaine,<br>
With that same <i>Squyre</i>, returned backe againe<br>
To his first way.  And as they forward went,<br>
They spyde a knight faire pricking on the plaine,<br>
As if he were on some aduenture bent,<br>
And in his port appeared manly hardiment.<p>

Sir <i>Satyrane</i> him towards did addresse,<br>
To weet, what wight he was, and what his quest:<br>
And comming nigh, eftsoones he gan to gesse<br>
Both by the burning hart, which on his brest<br>
He bare, and by the colours in his crest,<br>
That <i>Paridell</i> it was.  Tho to him yode,<br>
And him saluting, as beseemed best,<br>
Gan first inquire of tydings farre abrode;<br>
And afterwardes, on what aduenture now he rode.<p>

Who thereto answering, said; the tydings bad,<br>
Which now in Faerie court all men do tell,<br>
Which turned hath great mirth, to mourning sad,<br>
Is the late ruine of proud <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
And suddein parture of faire <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
To find him forth: and after her are gone<br>
All the braue knights, that doen in armes excell,<br>
To saueguard her, ywandred all alone;<br>
Emongst the rest my lot (vnworthy) is to be one.<p>

Ah gentle knight (said then Sir <i>Satyrane</i>)<br>
Thy labour all is lost, I greatly dread,<br>
That hast a thanklesse seruice on thee ta'ne,<br>
And offrest sacrifice vnto the dead:<br>
For dead, I surely doubt, thou maist aread<br>
Henceforth for euer <i>Florimell</i> to be.<br>
That all the noble knights of <i>Maydenhead</i>,<br>
Which her ador'd, may sore repent with me,<br>
And all faire Ladies may for euer sory be.<p>

Which words when <i>Paridell</i> had heard, his hew<br>
Gan greatly chaunge, and seem'd dismayd to bee;<br>
Then said, Faire Sir, how may I weene it trew,<br>
That ye doe tell in such vncertaintee?<br>
Or speake ye of report, or did ye see<br>
Iust cause of dread, that makes ye doubt so sore?<br>
For perdie else how mote it euer bee,<br>
That euer hand should dare for to engore<br>
Her noble bloud? the heauens such crueltie abhore.<p>

These eyes did see, that they will euer rew<br>
T'haue seene, (quoth he) when as a monstrous beast<br>
The Palfrey, whereon she did trauell, slew,<br>
And of his bowels made his bloudie feast:<br>
Which speaking token sheweth at the least<br>
Her certaine losse, if not her sure decay:<br>
Besides, that more suspition encreast,<br>
I found her golden girdle cast astray,<br>
Distaynd with durt and bloud, as relique of the pray.<p>

Aye me, (said <i>Paridell</i>) the signes be sad,<br>
And but God turne the same to good soothsay,<br>
That Ladies safetie is sore to be drad:<br>
Yet will I not forsake my forward way,<br>
Till triall doe more certaine truth bewray.<br>
Faire Sir (quoth he) well may it you succeed,<br>
Ne long shall <i>Satyrane</i> behind you stay,<br>
But to the rest, which in this Quest proceed<br>
My labour adde, and be partaker of their speed.<p>

Ye noble knights (said then the <i>Squire of Dames</i>)<br>
Well may ye speed in so praiseworthy paine:<br>
But sith the Sunne now ginnes to slake his beames,<br>
In deawy vapours of the westerne maine,<br>
And lose the teme out of his weary waine,<br>
Mote not mislike you also to abate<br>
Your zealous hast, till morrow next againe<br>
Both light of heauen, and strength of men relate:<br>
Which if ye please, to yonder castle turne your gate.<p>

That counsell pleased well; so all yfere<br>
Forth marched to a Castle them before,<br>
Where soone arriuing, they restrained were<br>
Of readie entrance, which ought euermore<br>
To errant knights be commun: wondrous sore<br>
Thereat displeasd they were, till that young Squire<br>
Gan them informe the cause, why that same dore<br>
Was shut to all, which lodging did desire:<br>
The which to let you weet, will further time require.<p>
