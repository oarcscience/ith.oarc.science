<i>Prince Arthur heares of Florimell:<br>

Belphebe finds him almost dead,<br>
and reareth out of sownd.</i><p>

VV
Onder it is to see, in diuerse minds,<br>
How diuersly loue doth his pageants play,<br>
And shewes his powre in variable kinds:<br>
The baser wit, whose idle thoughts alway<br>
Are wont to cleaue vnto the lowly clay,<br>
It stirreth vp to sensuall desire,<br>
And in lewd slouth to wast his carelesse day:<br>
But in braue sprite it kindles goodly fire,<br>
That to all high desert and honour doth aspire.<p>

Ne suffereth it vncomely idlenesse,<br>
In his free thought to build her sluggish nest:<br>
Ne suffereth it thought of vngentlenesse,<br>
Euer to creepe into his noble brest,<br>
But to the highest and the worthiest<br>
Lifteth it vp, that else would lowly fall:<br>
It lets not fall, it lets it not to rest:<br>
It lets not scarse this Prince to breath at all,<br>
But to his first poursuit him forward still doth call.<p>

Who long time wandred through the forrest wyde,<br>
To finde some issue thence, till that at last<br>
He met a Dwarfe, that seemed terrifyde<br>
With some late perill, which he hardly past,<br>
Or other accident, which him aghast;<br>
Of whom he asked, whence he lately came,<br>
And whither now he trauelled so fast:<br>
For sore he swat, and running through that same<br>
Thicke forest, was bescratcht, &amp; both his feet nigh lame.<p>

Panting for breath, and almost out of hart,<br>
The Dwarfe him answerd, Sir, ill mote I stay<br>
To tell the same.  I lately did depart<br>
From Faery court, where I haue many a day<br>
Serued a gentle Lady of great sway,<br>
And high accompt throughout all Elfin land,<br>
Who lately left the same, and tooke this way:<br>
Her now I seeke, and if ye vnderstand<br>
Which way she fared hath, good Sir tell out of hand.<p>

What mister wight (said he) and how arayd?<br>
Royally clad (quoth he) in cloth of gold,<br>
As meetest may beseeme a noble mayd;<br>
Her faire lockes in rich circlet be enrold,<br>
A fairer wight did neuer Sunne behold,<br>
And on a Palfrey rides more white then snow,<br>
Yet she her selfe is whiter manifold:<br>
The surest signe, whereby ye may her know,<br>
Is, that she is the fairest wight aliue, I trow.<p>

Now certes swaine (said he) such one I weene,<br>
Fast flying through this forest from her fo,<br>
A foule ill fauoured foster, I haue seene;<br>
Her selfe, well as I might, I reskewd tho,<br>
But could not stay; so fast she did foregoe,<br>
Carried away with wings of speedy feare.<br>
Ah dearest God (quoth he) that is great woe,<br>
And wondrous ruth to all, that shall it heare.<br>
But can ye read Sir, how I may her find, or where.<p>

Perdy me leuer were to weeten that,<br>
(Said he) then ransome of the richest knight,<br>
Or all the good that euer yet I gat:<br>
But froward fortune, and too forward Night<br>
Such happinesse did, maulgre, to me spight,<br>
And fro me reft both life and light attone.<br>
But Dwarfe aread, what is that Lady bright,<br>
That through this forest wandreth thus alone;<br>
For of her errour straunge I haue great ruth and mone.<p>

That Lady is (quoth he) where so she bee,<br>
The bountiest virgin, and most debonaire,<br>
That euer liuing eye I weene did see;<br>
Liues none this day, that may with her compare<br>
In stedfast chastitie and vertue rare,<br>
The goodly ornaments of beautie bright;<br>
And is ycleped <i>Florimell</i> the faire,<br>
Faire <i>Florimell</i> belou'd of many a knight,<br>
Yet she loues none but one, that <i>Marinell</i> is hight.<p>

A Sea-nymphes sonne, that <i>Marinell</i> is hight,<br>
Of my deare Dame is loued dearely well;<br>
In other none, but him, she sets delight,<br>
All her delight is set on <i>Marinell</i>;<br>
But he sets nought at all by <i>Florimell</i>:<br>
For Ladies loue his mother long ygoe<br>
Did him, they say, forwarne through sacred spell.<br>
But fame now flies, that of a forreine foe<br>
He is yslaine, which is the ground of all our woe.<p>

Fiue dayes there be, since he (they say) was slaine,<br>
And foure, since <i>Florimell</i> the Court for-went,<br>
And vowed neuer to returne againe,<br>
Till him aliue or dead she did inuent.<br>
Therefore, faire Sir, for loue of knighthood gent,<br>
And honour of trew Ladies, if ye may<br>
By your good counsell, or bold hardiment,<br>
Or succour her, or me direct the way;<br>
Do one, or other good, I you most humbly pray.<p>

So may ye gaine to you full great renowme,<br>
Of all good Ladies through the world so wide,<br>
And haply in her hart find highest rowme,<br>
Of whom ye seeke to be most magnifide:<br>
At least eternall meede shall you abide.<br>
To whom the Prince; Dwarfe, comfort to thee take,<br>
For till thou tidings learne, what her betide,<br>
I here auow thee neuer to forsake.<br>
Ill weares he armes, that nill them vse for Ladies sake.<p>

So with the Dwarfe he backe return'd againe,<br>
To seeke his Lady, where he mote her find;<br>
But by the way he greatly gan complaine<br>
The want of his good Squire late left behind,<br>
For whom he wondrous pensiue grew in mind,<br>
For doubt of daunger, which mote him betide;<br>
For him he loued aboue all mankind,<br>
Hauing him trew and faithfull euer tride,<br>
And bold, as euer Squire that waited by knights side.<p>

Who all this while full hardly was assayd<br>
Of deadly daunger, which to him betid;<br>
For whiles his Lord pursewd that noble Mayd,<br>
After that foster fowle he fiercely rid,<br>
To bene auenged of the shame, he did<br>
To that faire Damzell: Him he chaced long<br>
Through the thicke woods, wherein he would haue hid<br>
His shamefull head from his auengement strong.<br>
And oft him threatned death for his outrageous wrong.<p>

Nathlesse the villen sped him selfe so well,<br>
Whether through swiftnesse of his speedy beast,<br>
Or knowledge of those woods, where he did dwell,<br>
That shortly he from daunger was releast,<br>
And out of sight escaped at the least;<br>
Yet not escaped from the dew reward<br>
Of his bad deeds, which dayly he increast,<br>
Ne ceased not, till him oppressed hard<br>
The heauy plague, that for such leachours is prepard.<p>

For soone as he was vanisht out of sight,<br>
His coward courage gan emboldned bee,<br>
And cast t'auenge him of that fowle despight,<br>
Which he had borne of his bold enimee.<br>
Tho to his brethren came: for they were three<br>
Vngratious children of one gracelesse sire,<br>
And vnto them complained, how that he<br>
Had vsed bene of that foolehardy Squire;<br>
So them with bitter words he stird to bloudy ire.<p>

Forthwith themselues with their sad instruments<br>
Of spoyle and murder they gan arme byliue,<br>
And with him forth into the forest went,<br>
To wreake the wrath, which he did earst reuiue<br>
In their sterne brests, on him which late did driue<br>
Their brother to reproch and shamefull flight:<br>
For they had vow'd, that neuer he aliue<br>
Out of that forest should escape their might;<br>
Vile rancour their rude harts had fild with such despight.<p>

Within that wood there was a couert glade,<br>
Foreby a narrow foord, to them well knowne,<br>
Through which it was vneath for wight to wade;<br>
And now by fortune it was ouerflowne:<br>
By that same way they knew that Squire vnknowne<br>
Mote algates passe; for thy, themselues they set<br>
There in await, with thicke woods ouer growne,<br>
And all the while their malice they did whet<br>
With cruell threats, his passage through the ford to let.<p>

It fortuned, as they deuized had,<br>
The gentle Squire came ryding that same way,<br>
Vnweeting of their wile and treason bad,<br>
And through the ford to passen did assay;<br>
But that fierce foster, which late fled away,<br>
Stoutly forth stepping on the further shore,<br>
Him boldly bad his passage there to stay,<br>
Till he had made amends, and full restore<br>
For all the damage, which he had him doen afore.<p>

With that at him a quiu'ring dart he threw,<br>
With so fell force and villeinous despighte,<br>
That through his haberieon the forkehead flew,<br>
And through the linked mayles empierced quite,<br>
But had no powre in his soft flesh to bite:<br>
That stroke the hardy Squire did sore displease,<br>
But more that him he could not come to smite;<br>
For by no meanes the high banke he could sease,<br>
But labour'd long in that deepe ford with vaine disease.<p>

And still the foster with his long bore-speare<br>
Him kept from landing at his wished will;<br>
Anone one sent out of the thicket neare<br>
A cruell shaft, headed with deadly ill,<br>
And fethered with an vnlucky quill;<br>
The wicked steele stayd not, till it did light<br>
In his left thigh, and deepely did it thrill:<br>
Exceeding griefe that wound in him empight,<br>
But more that with his foes he could not come to fight.<p>

At last through wrath and vengeaunce making way,<br>
He on the bancke arriu'd with mickle paine,<br>
Where the third brother him did sore assay,<br>
And droue at him with all his might and maine<br>
A forrest bill, which both his hands did straine;<br>
But warily he did auoide the blow,<br>
And with his speare requited him againe,<br>
That both his sides were thrilled with the throw,<br>
And a large streame of bloud out of the wound did flow.<p>

He tombling downe, with gnashing teeth did bite<br>
The bitter earth, and bad to let him in<br>
Into the balefull house of endlesse night,<br>
Where wicked ghosts do waile their former sin.<br>
Tho gan the battell freshly to begin;<br>
For nathemore for that spectacle bad,<br>
Did th'other two their cruell vengeaunce blin,<br>
But both attonce on both sides him bestad,<br>
And load vpon him layd, his life for to haue had.<p>

Tho when that villain he auiz'd, which late<br>
Affrighted had the fairest <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
Full of fiers fury, and indignant hate,<br>
To him he turned, and with rigour fell<br>
Smote him so rudely on the Pannikell,<br>
That to the chin he cleft his head in twaine:<br>
Downe on the ground his carkas groueling fell;<br>
His sinfull soule with desperate disdaine,<br>
Out of her fleshly ferme fled to the place of paine.<p>

That seeing now the onely last of three,<br>
Who with that wicked shaft him wounded had,<br>
Trembling with horrour, as that did foresee<br>
The fearefull end of his auengement sad,<br>
Through which he follow should his brethren bad,<br>
His bootelesse bow in feeble hand vpcaught,<br>
And therewith shot an arrow at the lad;<br>
Which faintly fluttring, scarce his helmet raught,<br>
And glauncing fell to ground, but him annoyed naught.<p>

With that he would haue fled into the wood;<br>
But <i>Timias</i> him lightly ouerhent,<br>
Right as he entring was into the flood,<br>
And strooke at him with force so violent,<br>
That headlesse him into the foord he sent:<br>
The carkas with the streame was carried downe,<br>
But th'head fell backeward on the continent.<br>
So mischief fel vpon the meaners crowne;<br>
They three be dead with shame, the Squire liues with renowne.<p>

He liues, but takes small ioy of his renowne;<br>
For of that cruell wound he bled so sore,<br>
That from his steed he fell in deadly swowne;<br>
Yet still the bloud forth gusht in so great store,<br>
That he lay wallowd all in his owne gore.<br>
Now God thee keepe, thou gentlest Squire aliue,<br>
Else shall thy louing Lord thee see no more,<br>
But both of comfort him thou shalt depriue,<br>
And eke thy selfe of honour, which thou didst atchiue.<p>

Prouidence heauenly passeth liuing thought,<br>
And doth for wretched mens reliefe make way;<br>
For loe great grace or fortune thither brought<br>
Comfort to him, that comfortlesse now lay.<br>
In those same woods, ye well remember may,<br>
How that a noble hunteresse did wonne,<br>
She, that base <i>Braggadochio</i> did affray,<br>
And made him fast out of the forrest runne;<br>
<i>Belphoebe</i> was her name, as faire as <i>Phoebus</i> sunne.<p>

She on a day, as she pursewd the chace<br>
Of some wild beast, which with her arrowes keene<br>
She wounded had, the same along did trace<br>
By tract of bloud, which she had freshly seene,<br>
To haue besprinckled all the grassy greene;<br>
By the great persue, which she there perceau'd,<br>
Well hoped she the beast engor'd had beene,<br>
And made more hast, the life to haue bereau'd:<br>
But ah, her expectation greatly was deceau'd.<p>

Shortly she came, whereas that woefull Squire<br>
With bloud deformed, lay in deadly swownd:<br>
In whose faire eyes, like lamps of quenched fire,<br>
The Christall humour stood congealed rownd;<br>
His locks, like faded leaues fallen to grownd,<br>
Knotted with bloud, in bounches rudely ran,<br>
And his sweete lips, on which before that stownd<br>
The bud of youth to blossome faire began,<br>
Spoild of their rosie red, were woxen pale and wan.<p>

Saw neuer liuing eye more heauy sight,<br>
That could haue made a rocke of stone to rew,<br>
Or riue in twaine: which when that Lady bright<br>
Besides all hope with melting eyes did vew,<br>
All suddeinly abasht she chaunged hew,<br>
And with sterne horrour backward gan to start:<br>
But when she better him beheld, she grew<br>
Full of soft passion and vnwonted smart:<br>
The point of pitty perced through her tender hart.<p>

Meekely she bowed downe, to weete if life<br>
Yet in his frosen members did remaine,<br>
And feeling by his pulses beating rife,<br>
That the weake soule her seat did yet retaine,<br>
She cast to comfort him with busie paine:<br>
His double folded necke she reard vpright,<br>
And rubd his temples, and each trembling vaine;<br>
His mayled haberieon she did vndight,<br>
And from his head his heauy burganet did light.<p>

Into the woods thenceforth in hast she went,<br>
To seeke for hearbes, that mote him remedy;<br>
For she of hearbes had great intendiment,<br>
Taught of the Nymphe, which from her infancy<br>
Her nourced had in trew Nobility:<br>
There, whether it diuine <i>Tobacco</i> were,<br>
Or <i>Panach&aelig;a</i>, or <i>Polygony</i>,<br>
She found, and brought it to her patient deare<br>
Who al this while lay bleeding out his hart-bloud neare.<p>

The soueraigne weede betwixt two marbles plaine<br>
She pownded small, and did in peeces bruze,<br>
And then atweene her lilly handes twaine,<br>
Into his wound the iuyce thereof did scruze,<br>
And round about, as she could well it vze,<br>
The flesh therewith she suppled and did steepe,<br>
T'abate all spasme, and soke the swelling bruze,<br>
And after hauing searcht the intuse deepe,<br>
She with her scarfe did bind the wound fr&otilde; cold to keepe.<p>

By this he had sweete life recur'd againe,<br>
And groning inly deepe, at last his eyes,<br>
His watry eyes, drizling like deawy raine,<br>
He vp gan lift toward the azure skies,<br>
From whence descend all hopelesse remedies:<br>
Therewith he sigh'd, and turning him aside,<br>
The goodly Mayd full of diuinities,<br>
And gifts of heauenly grace he by him spide,<br>
Her bow and gilden quiuer lying him beside.<p>

Mercy deare Lord (said he) what grace is this,<br>
That thou hast shewed to me sinfull wight,<br>
To send thine Angell from her bowre of blis,<br>
To comfort me in my distressed plight?<br>
Angell, or Goddesse do I call thee right?<br>
What seruice may I do vnto thee meete,<br>
That hast from darkenesse me returnd to light,<br>
And with thy heauenly salues and med'cines sweete,<br>
Hast drest my sinfull wounds? I kisse thy blessed feete.<p>

Thereat she blushing said, Ah gentle Squire,<br>
Nor Goddesse I, nor Angell, but the Mayd,<br>
And daughter of a woody Nymphe, desire<br>
No seruice, bu tthy safety and ayd;<br>
Which if thou gaine, I shalbe well apayd.<br>
We mortall wights, whose liues and fortunes bee<br>
To commun accidents still open layd,<br>
Are bound with commun bond of frailtee,<br>
To succour wretched wights, whom we captiued see.<p>

By this her Damzels, which the former chace<br>
Had vndertaken after her, arriu'd,<br>
As did <i>Belphoebe</i>, in the bloudy place,<br>
And thereby deemd the beast had bene depriu'd<br>
Of life, whom late their Ladies arrow ryu'd:<br>
For thy, the bloudy tract they follow fast,<br>
And euery one to runne the swiftest stryu'd;<br>
But two of them the rest far ouerpast,<br>
And where their Lady was, arriued at the last.<p>

Where when they saw that goodly boy, with blood<br>
Defowled, and their Lady dresse his wownd,<br>
They wondred much, and shortly vnderstood,<br>
How him in deadly case their Lady fownd,<br>
And reskewed out of the heauy stownd.<br>
Eftsoones his warlike courser, which was strayd<br>
Farre in the woods, whiles that he lay in swownd,<br>
She made those Damzels search, which being stayd,<br>
They did him set thereon, and forthwith them conuayd.<p>

Into that forest farre they thence him led,<br>
Where was their dwelling, in a pleasant glade,<br>
With mountaines round about enuironed,<br>
And mighty woods, which did the valley shade,<br>
And like a stately Theatre it made,<br>
Spreading it selfe into a spatious plaine.<br>
And in the midst a little riuer plaide<br>
Emongst the pumy stones, which seemd to plaine<br>
With gentle murmure, that his course they did restraine.<p>

Beside the same a dainty place there lay,<br>
Planted with mirtle trees and laurels greene,<br>
In which the birds song many a louely lay<br>
Of gods high prayse, and of their loues sweet teene,<br>
As it an earthly Paradize had beene:<br>
In whose enclosed shadow there was pight<br>
A faire Pauilion, scarcely to be seene,<br>
The which was all within most richly dight,<br>
That greatest Princes liuing it mote well delight.<p>

Thither they brought that wounded Squire, and layd<br>
In easie couch his feeble limbes to rest,<br>
He rested him a while, and then the Mayd<br>
His ready wound with better salues new drest;<br>
Dayly she dressed him, and did the best<br>
His grieuous hurt to garish, that she might,<br>
That shortly she his dolour hath redrest,<br>
And his foule sore reduced to faire plight:<br>
It she reduced, but himselfe destroyed quight.<p>

O foolish Physick, and vnfruitfull paine,<br>
That heales vp one and makes another wound:<br>
She his hurt thigh to him recur'd againe,<br>
But hurt his hart, the which before was sound,<br>
Through an vnwary dart, which did rebound<br>
From her faire eyes and gracious countenaunce.<br>
What bootes it him from death to be vnbound,<br>
To be captiued in endlesse duraunce<br>
Of sorrow and despaire without aleggeaunce?<p>

Still as his wound did gather, and grow hole,<br>
So still his hart woxe sore, and health decayd:<br>
Madnesse to saue a part, and lose the whole.<br>
Still whenas he beheld the heauenly Mayd,<br>
Whiles dayly plaisters to his wound she layd,<br>
So still his Malady the more increast,<br>
The whiles her matchlesse beautie him dismayd.<br>
Ah God, what other could he do at least,<br>
But loue so faire a Lady, that his life releast?<p>

Long while he stroue in his courageous brest,<br>
With reason dew the passion to subdew,<br>
And loue for to dislodge out of his nest:<br>
Still when her excellencies he did vew,<br>
Her soueraigne bounty, and celestiall hew,<br>
The same to loue he strongly was constraind:<br>
But when his meane estate he did reuew,<br>
He from such hardy boldnesse was restraind,<br>
And of his lucklesse lot and cruell loue thus plaind.<p>

Vnthankfull wretch (said he) is this the meed,<br>
With which her soueraigne mercy thou doest quight?<br>
Thy life she saued by her gracious deed,<br>
But thou doest weene with villeinous despight,<br>
To blot her honour, and her heauenly light.<br>
Dye rather, dye, then so disloyally<br>
Deeme of her high desert, or seeme so light:<br>
Faire death it is to shonne more shame, to dy:<br>
Dye rather, dy, then euer loue disloyally.<p>

But if to loue disloyalty it bee,<br>
Shall I then hate her, that from deathes dore<br>
Me brought? ah farre be such reproch fro mee.<br>
What can I lesse do, then her loue therefore,<br>
Sith I her dew reward cannot restore:<br>
Dye rather, dye, and dying do her serue,<br>
Dying her serue, and liuing her adore;<br>
Thy life she gaue, thy life she doth deserue:<br>
Dye rather, dye, then euer from her seruice swerue.<p>

But foolish boy, what bootes thy seruice bace<br>
To her, to whom the heauens do serue and sew?<br>
Thou a meane Squire, of meeke and lowly place,<br>
She heauenly borne, and of celestiall hew.<br>
How then? of all loue taketh equall vew:<br>
And doth not highest God vouchsafe to take<br>
The loue and seruice of the basest crew?<br>
If she will not, dye meekly for her sake;<br>
Dye rather, dye, then euer so faire loue forsake.<p>

Thus warreid he long time against his will,<br>
Till that through weaknesse he was forst at last,<br>
To yield himselfe vnto the mighty ill:<br>
Which as a victour proud, gan ransack fast<br>
His inward parts, and all his entrayles wast,<br>
That neither bloud in face, nor life in hart<br>
It left, but both did quite drye vp, and blast;<br>
As percing leuin, which the inner part<br>
Of euery thing consumes, and calcineth by art.<p>

Which seeing faire <i>Belphoebe</i>, gan to feare,<br>
Least that his wound were inly well not healed,<br>
Or that the wicked steele empoysned were:<br>
Litle she weend, that loue he close concealed;<br>
Yet still he wasted, as the snow congealed,<br>
When the bright sunne his beams thereon doth beat;<br>
Yet neuer he his hart to her reuealed,<br>
But rather chose to dye for sorrow great,<br>
Then with dishonorable termes her to entreat.<p>

She gracious Lady, yet no paines did spare,<br>
To do him ease, or do him remedy:<br>
Many Restoratiues of vertues rare,<br>
And costly Cordialles she did apply,<br>
To mitigate his stubborne mallady:<br>
But that sweet Cordiall, which can restore<br>
A loue-sick hart, she did to him enuy;<br>
To him, and to all th'vnworthy world forlore<br>
She did enuy that soueraigne salue, in secret store.<p>

That dainty Rose, the daughter of her Morne,<br>
More deare then life she tendered, whose flowre<br>
The girlond of her honour did adorne:<br>
Ne suffred she the Middayes scorching powre,<br>
Ne the sharp Northerne wind thereon to showre,<br>
But lapped vp her silken leaues most chaire,<br>
When so the froward skye began to lowre:<br>
But soone as calmed was the Christall aire,<br>
She did it faire dispred, and let to florish faire.<p>

Eternall God in his almighty powre,<br>
To make ensample of his heauenly grace,<br>
In Paradize whilome did plant this flowre,<br>
Whence he it fetcht out of her natiue place,<br>
And did in stocke of earthly flesh enrace,<br>
That mortall men her glory should admire<br>
In gentle Ladies brest, and bounteous race<br>
Of woman kind it fairest flowre doth spire,<br>
And beareth fruit of honour and all chast desire.<p>

Faire ympes of beautie, whose bright shining beames<br>
Adorne the world with like to heauenly light,<br>
And to your willes both royalties and Realmes<br>
Subdew, through conquest of your wondrous might,<br>
With this faire flowre your goodly girlonds dight,<br>
Of chastity and vertue virginall,<br>
That shall embellish more your beautie bright,<br>
And crowne your heades with heauenly coronall,<br>
Such as the Angels weare before Gods tribunall.<p>

To youre faire selues a faire ensample frame,<br>
Of this faire virgin, this <i>Belphoebe</i> faire,<br>
To whom in perfect loue, and spotlesse fame,<br>
Of chastitie, none liuing may compaire:<br>
Ne poysnous Enuy iustly can empaire<br>
The prayse of her fresh flowring Maidenhead;<br>
For thy, she standeth on the highest staire<br>
Of th'honorable stage of womanhead,<br>
That Ladies all may follow her ensample dead.<p>

In so great prayse of stedfast chastity,<br>
Nathlesse she was so curteous and kind,<br>
Tempred with grace, and goodly modesty,<br>
That seemed those two vertues stroue to find<br>
The higher place in her Heroick mind:<br>
So striuing each did other more augment,<br>
And both encreast the prayse of woman kind,<br>
And both encreast her beautie excellent;<br>
So all did make in her a perfect complement.<p>
