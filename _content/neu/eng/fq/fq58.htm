<blockquote>
<i>Talus brings newes to Britomart<br>
of Artegals mishap,<br>
She goes to seeke him, Dolon meetes<br>
who seekes her to entrap.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
S
Ome men, I wote, will deeme in <i>Artegall</i><br>
Great weaknesse, and report of him much ill,<br>
For yeelding so himselfe a wretched thrall,<br>
To th'insolent commaund of womens will;<br>
That all his former praise doth fowly spill.<br>
But he the man, that say or doe so dare,<br>
Be well aduiz'd, that he stand stedfast still:<br>
For neuer yet was wight so well aware,<br>
But he at first or last was trapt in womens snare.<p>

Yet in the streightnesse of that captiue state,<br>
This gentle knight himselfe so well behaued,<br>
That notwithstanding all the subtill bait,<br>
With which those Amazons his loue still craued,<br>
To his owne loue his loialtie he saued:<br>
Whose character in th'Adamantine mould<br>
Of his true hart so firmely was engraued,<br>
That no new loues impression euer could<br>
Bereaue it thence: such blot his honour blemish should.<p>

Yet his owne loue, the noble <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
Scarse so conceiued in her iealous thought,<br>
What time sad tydings of his balefull smart<br>
In womans bondage, <i>Talus</i> to her brought;<br>
Brought in vntimely houre, ere it was sought.<br>
For after that the vtmost date, assynde<br>
For his returne, she waited had for nought,<br>
She gan to cast in her misdoubtfull mynde<br>
A thousand feares, that loue-sicke fancies faine to fynde.<p>

Sometime she feared, least some hard mishap<br>
Had him misfalne in his aduenturous quest;<br>
Sometime least his false foe did him entrap<br>
In traytrous traine, or had vnwares opprest:<br>
But most she did her troubled mynd molest,<br>
And secretly afflict with iealous feare,<br>
Least some new loue had him from her possest;<br>
Yet loth she was, since she no ill did heare,<br>
To thinke of him so ill: yet could she not forbeare.<p>

One while she blam'd her selfe; another whyle<br>
She him condemn'd, as trustlesse and vntrew:<br>
And then, her griefe with errour to beguyle,<br>
She fayn'd to count the time againe anew,<br>
As if before she had not counted trew.<br>
For houres but dayes; for weekes, that passed were,<br>
She told but moneths, to make them seeme more few:<br>
Yet when she reckned them, still drawing neare,<br>
Each hour did seeme a moneth, &amp; euery moneth a yeare.<p>

But when as yet she saw him not returne,<br>
She thought to send some one to seeke him out;<br>
But none she found so fit to serue that turne,<br>
As her owne selfe, to ease her selfe of dout.<br>
Now she deuiz'd amongst the warlike rout<br>
Of errant Knights, to seeke her errant Knight;<br>
And then againe resolu'd to hunt him out<br>
Amongst loose Ladies, lapped in delight:<br>
And then both Knights enuide, &amp; Ladies eke did spight.<p>

One day, when as she long had sought for ease<br>
In euery place, and euery place thought best,<br>
Yet found no place, that could her liking please,<br>
She to a window came, that opened West,<br>
Towards which coast her loue his way addrest.<br>
There looking forth, shee in her heart did find<br>
Many vaine fancies, working her vnrest;<br>
And sent her winged thoughts, more swift then wind,<br>
To beare vnto her loue the message of her mind.<p>

There as she looked long, at last she spide<br>
One comming towards her with hasty speede:<br>
Well weend she then, ere him she plaine descride,<br>
That it was one sent from her loue indeede.<br>
Who when he nigh approcht, shee mote arede<br>
That it was <i>Talus</i>, <i>Artegall</i> his groome;<br>
Whereat her heart was fild with hope and drede;<br>
Ne would she stay, till he in place could come,<br>
But ran to meete him forth, to know his tidings somme.<p>

Euen in the dore him meeting, she begun;<br>
And where is he thy Lord, and how far hence?<br>
Declare at once; and hath he lost or wun?<br>
The yron man, albe he wanted sence<br>
And sorrowes feeling, yet with conscience<br>
Of his ill newes, did inly chill and quake,<br>
And stood still mute, as one in great suspence,<br>
As if that by his silence he would make<br>
Her rather reade his meaning, then him selfe it spake.<p>

Till she againe thus sayd; <i>Talus</i> be bold,<br>
And tell what euer it be, good or bad,<br>
That from thy tongue thy hearts intent doth hold.<br>
To whom he thus at length.  The tidings sad,<br>
That I would hide, will needs, I see, be rad.<br>
My Lord, your Loue, by hard mishap doth lie<br>
In wretched bondage, wofully bestad.<br>
Ay me (quoth she) what wicked destinie?<br>
And is he vanquisht by his tyrant enemy?<p>

Not by that Tyrant, his intended foe;<br>
But by a Tyrannesse (he then replide,)<br>
That him captiued hath in haplesse woe.<br>
Cease thou bad newes-man, badly doest thou hide<br>
Thy maisters shame, in harlots bondage tide.<br>
The rest my selfe too readily can spell.<br>
With that in rage she turn'd from him aside,<br>
Forcing in vaine the rest to her to tell,<br>
And to her chamber went like solitary cell.<p>

There she began to make her monefull plaint<br>
Against her Knight, for being so vntrew;<br>
And him to touch with falshoods fowle attaint,<br>
That all his other honour ouerthrew.<br>
Oft did she blame her selfe, and often rew,<br>
For yeelding to a straungers loue so light,<br>
Whose life and manners straunge she neuer knew;<br>
And euermore she did him sharpely twight<br>
For breach of faith to her, which he had firmely plight.<p>

And then she in her wrathfull will did cast,<br>
How to reuenge that blot of honour blent;<br>
To fight with him, and goodly die her last:<br>
And then againe she did her selfe torment,<br>
Inflicting on her selfe his punishment.<br>
A while she walkt, and chauft; a while she threw<br>
Her selfe vppon her bed, and did lament:<br>
Yet did she not lament with loude alew,<br>
As women wont, but with deepe sighes, and singulfs few.<p>

Like as a wayward childe, whose sounder sleepe<br>
Is broken with some fearefull dreames affright,<br>
With froward will doth set him selfe to weepe;<br>
Ne can be stild for all his nurses might,<br>
But kicks, and squals, and shriekes for fell despight:<br>
Now scratching her, and her loose locks misusing;<br>
Now seeking darkenesse, and now seeking light;<br>
Then crauing sucke, and then the sucke refusing.<br>
Such was this Ladies fit, in her loues fond accusing.<p>

But when she had with such vnquiet fits<br>
Her selfe there close afflicted long in vaine,<br>
Yet found no easement in her troubled wits,<br>
She vnto <i>Talus</i> forth return'd againe,<br>
By change of place seeking to ease her paine;<br>
And gan enquire of him, with mylder mood,<br>
The certaine cause of <i>Artegals</i> detaine;<br>
And what he did, and in what state he stood,<br>
And whether he did woo, or whether he were woo'd.<p>

Ah wellaway (sayd then the yron man,)<br>
That he is not the while in state to woo;<br>
But lies in wretched thraldome, weake and wan,<br>
Not by strong hand compelled thereunto,<br>
But his owne doome, that none can now vndoo.<br>
Sayd I not then (quoth shee) erwhile aright,<br>
That this is things compacte betwixt you two,<br>
Me to deceiue of faith vnto me plight,<br>
Since that he was not forst, nor ouercome in fight?<p>

With that he gan at large to her dilate<br>
The whole discourse of his captiuance sad,<br>
In sort as ye haue heard the same of late.<br>
All which when she with hard enduraunce had<br>
Heard to the end, she was right sore bestad,<br>
With sodaine stounds of wrath and griefe attone:<br>
Ne would abide, till she had aunswere made,<br>
But streight her selfe did dight, and armor don;<br>
And mounting to her steede, bad <i>Talus</i> guide her on.<p>

So forth she rode vppon her ready way,<br>
To seeke her Knight, as <i>Talus</i> her did guide:<br>
Sadly she rode, and neuer word did say,<br>
Nor good nor bad, ne euer lookt aside,<br>
But still right downe, and in her thought did hide<br>
The felnesse of her heart, right fully bent<br>
To fierce auengement of that womans pride,<br>
Which had her Lord in her base prison pent,<br>
And so great honour with so fowle reproch had blent.<p>

So as she thus melancholicke did ride,<br>
Chawing the cud of griefe and inward paine,<br>
She chaunst to meete toward th'euen-tide<br>
A Knight, that softly paced on the plaine,<br>
As if him selfe to solace he were faine.<br>
Well shot in yeares he seem'd, and rather bent<br>
To peace, then needlesse trouble to constraine.<br>
As well by view of that his vestiment,<br>
As by his modest semblant, that no euill ment.<p>

He comming neare, gan gently her salute,<br>
With curteous words, in the most comely wize;<br>
Who though desirous rather to rest mute,<br>
Then termes to entertaine of common guize,<br>
Yet rather then she kindnesse would despize,<br>
She would her selfe displease, so him requite.<br>
Then gan the other further to deuize<br>
Of things abrode, as next to hand did light,<br>
And many things demaund, to which she answer'd light.<p>

For little lust had she to talke of ought,<br>
Or ought to heare, that mote delightfull bee;<br>
Her minde was whole possessed of one thought,<br>
That gaue none other place.  Which when as hee<br>
By outward signes, (as well he might) did see,<br>
He list no lenger to vse lothfull speach,<br>
But her besought to take it well in gree,<br>
Sith shady dampe had dimd the heauens reach,<br>
To lodge with him that night, vnles good cause empeach.<p>

The Championesse, now seeing night at dore,<br>
Was glad to yeeld vnto his good request:<br>
And with him went without gaine-saying more.<br>
Not farre away, but little wide by West,<br>
His dwelling was, to which he him addrest;<br>
Where soone arriuing they receiued were<br>
In seemely wise, as them beseemed best:<br>
For he their host them goodly well did cheare,<br>
And talk't of pleasant things, the night away to weare.<p>

Thus passing th'euening well, till time of rest,<br>
Then <i>Britomart</i> vnto a bowre was brought;<br>
Where groomes awayted her to haue vndrest.<br>
But she ne would vndressed be for ought,<br>
Ne doffe her armes, though he her much besought.<br>
For she had vow'd, she sayd, not to forgo<br>
Those warlike weedes, till she reuenge had wrought<br>
Of a late wrong vppon a mortall foe;<br>
Which she would sure performe, betide her wele or wo.<p>

Which when their Host perceiu'd, right discontent<br>
In minde he grew, for feare least by that art<br>
He should his purpose misse, which close he ment:<br>
Yet taking leaue of her, he did depart.<br>
There all that night remained <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
Restlesse, recomfortlesse, with heart deepe grieued,<br>
Not suffering the least twinckling sleepe to start<br>
Into her eye, which th'heart mote haue relieued,<br>
But if the least appear'd, her eyes she streight reprieued.<p>

Ye guilty eyes (sayd she) the which with guyle<br>
My heart at first betrayd, will ye betray<br>
My life now to, for which a little whyle<br>
Ye will not watch? false watches, wellaway,<br>
I wote when ye did watch both night and day<br>
Vnto your losse: and now needes will ye sleepe?<br>
Now ye haue made my heart to wake alway,<br>
Now will ye sleepe? ah wake, and rather weepe,<br>
To thinke of your nights want, that should yee waking keepe.<p>

Thus did she watch, and weare the weary night<br>
In waylfull plaints, that none was to appease;<br>
Now walking soft, now sitting still vpright,<br>
As sundry chaunge her seemed best to ease.<br>
Ne lesse did <i>Talus</i> suffer sleepe to seaze<br>
His eye-lids sad, but watcht continually,<br>
Lying without her dore in great disease;<br>
Like to a Spaniell wayting carefully<br>
Least any should betray his Lady treacherously.<p>

What time the natiue Belman of the night,<br>
The bird, that warned <i>Peter</i> of his fall,<br>
First rings his siluer Bell t'each sleepy wight,<br>
That should their mindes vp to deuotion call,<br>
She heard a wondrous noise below the hall.<br>
All sodainely the bed, where she should lie,<br>
By a false trap was let adowne to fall<br>
Into a lower roome, and by and by<br>
The loft was raysd againe, that no man could it spie.<p>

With sight whereof she was dismayd right sore,<br>
Perceiuing well the treason, which was ment:<br>
Yet stirred not at all for doubt of more,<br>
But kept her place with courage confident,<br>
Wayting what would ensue of that euent.<br>
It was not long, before she heard the sound<br>
Of armed men, comming with close intent<br>
Towards her chamber; at which dreadfull stound<br>
She quickly caught her sword, &amp; shield about her bound.<p>

With that there came vnto her chamber dore<br>
Two Knights, all armed ready for to fight,<br>
And after them full many other more,<br>
A raskall rout, with weapons rudely dight.<br>
Whom soone as <i>Talus</i> spide by glims of night,<br>
He started vp, there where on ground he lay,<br>
And in his hand his thresher ready keight.<br>
They seeing that, let driue at him streight way,<br>
And round about him preace in riotous aray.<p>

But soone as he began to lay about<br>
With his rude yron flaile, they gan to flie,<br>
Both armed Knights, and eke vnarmed rout:<br>
Yet <i>Talus</i> after them apace did plie,<br>
Where euer in the darke he could them spie;<br>
That here and there like scattred sheepe they lay.<br>
Then backe returning, where his Dame did lie,<br>
He to her told the story of that fray,<br>
And all that treason there intended did bewray.<p>

Wherewith though wondrous wroth, and inly burning,<br>
To be auenged for so fowle a deede,<br>
Yet being forst to abide the daies returning,<br>
She there remain'd, but with right wary heede,<br>
Least any more such practise should proceede.<br>
Now mote ye know (that which to <i>Britomart</i><br>
Vnknowen was) whence all this did proceede,<br>
And for what cause so great mischieuous smart<br>
Was ment to her, that neuer euill ment in hart.<p>

The goodman of this house was <i>Dolon</i> hight,<br>
A man of subtill wit and wicked minde,<br>
That whilome in his youth had bene a Knight,<br>
And armes had borne, but little good could finde,<br>
And much lesse honour by that warlike kinde<br>
Of life: for he was nothing valorous,<br>
But with slie shiftes and wiles did vnderminde<br>
All noble Knights, which were aduenturous,<br>
And many brought to shame by treason treacherous.<p>

He had three sonnes, all three like fathers sonnes,<br>
Like treacherous, like full of fraud and guile,<br>
Of all that on this earthly compasse wonnes:<br>
The eldest of the which was slaine erewhile<br>
By <i>Artegall</i>, through his owne guilty wile;<br>
His name was <i>Guizor</i>, whose vntimely fate<br>
For to auenge, full many treasons vile<br>
His father <i>Dolon</i> had deuiz'd of late<br>
With these his wicked sons, and shewd his cankred hate.<p>

For sure he weend, that this his present guest<br>
Was <i>Artegall</i>, by many tokens plaine;<br>
But chiefly by that yron page he ghest,<br>
Which still was wont with <i>Artegall</i> remaine;<br>
And therefore ment him surely to haue slaine.<br>
But by Gods grace, and her good heedinesse,<br>
She was preserued from their traytrous traine.<br>
Thus she all night wore out in watchfulnesse,<br>
Ne suffred slothfull sleepe her eyelids to oppresse.<p>

The morrow next, so soone as dawning houre<br>
Discouered had the light to liuing eye,<br>
She forth yssew'd out of her loathed bowre,<br>
With full intent t'auenge that villany,<br>
On that vilde man, and all his family.<br>
And comming down to seeke them, where they wond,<br>
Nor sire, nor sonnes, nor any could she spie:<br>
Each rowme she sought, but them all empty fond:<br>
They all were fled for feare, but whether, nether kond.<p>

She saw it vaine to make there lenger stay,<br>
But tooke her steede, and thereon mounting light,<br>
Gan her addresse vnto her former way.<br>
She had not rid the mountenance of a flight,<br>
But that she saw there present in her sight,<br>
Those two false brethren, on that perillous Bridge,<br>
On which <i>Pollente</i> with <i>Artegall</i> did fight.<br>
Streight was the passage like a ploughed ridge,<br>
That if two met, the one mote needes fall ouer the lidge.<p>

There they did thinke them selues on her to wreake:<br>
Who as she nigh vnto them drew, the one<br>
These vile reproches gan vnto her speake;<br>
Thou recreant false traytor, that with lone<br>
Of armes has knighthood stolne, yet Knight art none,<br>
No more shall now the darkenesse of the night<br>
Defend thee from the vengeance of thy fone,<br>
But with thy bloud thou shalt appease the spright<br>
Of <i>Guizor</i>, by thee slaine, and murdred by thy slight.<p>

Strange were the words in <i>Britomartis</i> eare;<br>
Yet stayd she not for them, but forward fared,<br>
Till to the perillous Bridge she came, and there<br>
<i>Talus</i> desir'd, that he might haue prepared<br>
The  way to her, and those two losels scared.<br>
But she thereat was wroth, that for despight<br>
The glauncing sparkles through her beuer glared,<br>
And from her eies did flash out fiery light,<br>
Like coles, that through a siluer Censer sparkle bright.<p>

She stayd not to aduise which way to take;<br>
But putting spurres vnto her fiery beast,<br>
Thorough the midst of them she way did make.<br>
The one of them, which most her wrath increast,<br>
Vppon her speare she bore before her breast,<br>
Till to the Bridges further end she past,<br>
Where falling downe, his challenge he releast:<br>
The other ouer side the Bridge she cast<br>
Into the riuer, where he drunke his deadly last.<p>

As when the flashing Leuin haps to light<br>
Vppon two stubborne oakes, which stand so neare,<br>
That way betwixt them none appeares in sight;<br>
The Engin fiercely flying forth, doth teare<br>
Th'one from the earth, &amp; through the aire doth beare;<br>
The other it with force doth ouerthrow,<br>
Vppon one side, and from his rootes doth reare.<br>
So did the Championesse those two there strow,<br>
And to their sire their carcasses left to bestow.<p>
