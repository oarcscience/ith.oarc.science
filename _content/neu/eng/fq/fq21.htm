<blockquote> 
<i>Sir Guyon laid in swowne is by<br>
Acrates sonnes despoyld,<br>
Whom Arthur soone hath reskewed<br>
And Paynim brethren foyld.</i><p>
</blockquote> 

 
<p>
<blockquote> 
A
Nd is there care in heauen? and is there loue<br>
In heauenly spirits to these creatures bace,<br>
That may compassion of their euils moue?<br>
There is: else much more wretched were the cace<br>
Of men, then beasts.  But &ocirc; th'exceeding grace<br>
Of highest God, that loues his creatures so,<br>
And all his workes with mercy doth embrace,<br>
That blessed Angels, he sends to and fro,<br>
To serue to wicked man, to serue his wicked foe.<p>
 
How oft do they, their siluer bowers leaue,<br>
To come to succour vs, that succour want?<br>
How oft do they with golden pineons, cleaue<br>
The flitting skyes, like flying Pursuiuant,<br>
Against foule feends to aide vs millitant?<br>
They for vs fight, they watch and dewly ward,<br>
And their bright Squadrons round about vs plant,<br>
And all for loue, and nothing for reward:<br>
O why should heauenly God to man haue such regard?<p>
 
During the while, that <i>Guyon</i> did abide<br>
In <i>Mammons</i> house, the Palmer, whom whyleare<br>
That wanton Mayd of passage had denide,<br>
By further search had passage found elsewhere,<br>
And being on his way, approched neare,<br>
Where <i>Guyon</i> lay in traunce, when suddenly<br>
He heard a voice, that called loud and cleare,<br>
Come hither, come hither, &ocirc; come hastily;<br>
That all the fields resounded with the ruefull cry.<p>
 
The Palmer lent his eare vnto the noyce,<br>
To weet, who called so importunely:<br>
Againe he heard a more efforced voyce,<br>
That bad him come in haste.  He by and by<br>
His feeble feet directed to the cry;<br>
Which to that shadie delue him brought at last,<br>
Where <i>Mammon</i> earst did sunne his threasury:<br>
There the good <i>Guyon</i> he found slumbring fast<br>
In senselesse dreame; which sight at first him sore aghast.<p>
 
Beside his head there sate a faire young man,<br>
Of wondrous beautie, and of freshest yeares,<br>
Whose tender bud to blossome new began,<br>
And flourish faire aboue his equall peares;<br>
His snowy front curled with golden heares,<br>
Like <i>Phoebus</i> face adornd with sunny rayes,<br>
Diuinely shone, and two sharpe winged sheares,<br>
Decked with diuerse plumes, like painted Iayes,<br>
Were fixed at his backe, to cut his ayerie wayes.<p>
 
Like as <i>Cupido</i> on <i>Id&aelig;an</i> hill,<br>
When hauing laid his cruell bow away,<br>
And mortall arrowes, wherewith he doth fill<br>
The world with murdrous spoiles and bloudie pray,<br>
With his faire mother he him dights to play,<br>
And with his goodly sisters, <i>Graces</i> three;<br>
The Goddesse pleased with his wanton play,<br>
Suffers her selfe through sleepe beguild to bee,<br>
The whiles the other Ladies mind their merry glee.<p>
 
Whom when the Palmer saw, abasht he was<br>
Through fear and wonder, that he nought could say,<br>
Till him the child bespoke, Long lackt, alas,<br>
Hath bene thy faithfull aide in hard assay,<br>
Whiles deadly fit thy pupill doth dismay;<br>
Behold this heauie sight, thou reuerend Sire,<br>
But dread of death and dolour doe away;<br>
For life ere long shall to her home retire,<br>
And he that breathlesse seemes, shal corage bold respire.<p>
 
The charge, which God doth vnto me arret,<br>
Of his deare safetie, I to thee commend;<br>
Yet will I not forgoe, ne yet forget<br>
The care thereof my selfe vnto the end,<br>
But euermore him succour, and defend<br>
Against his foe and mine: watch thou I pray;<br>
For euill is at hand him to offend.<br>
So hauing said, eftsoones he gan display<br>
His painted nimble wings, and vanisht quite away.<p>
 
The Palmer seeing his left empty place,<br>
And his slow eyes beguiled of their sight,<br>
Woxe sore affraid, and standing still a space,<br>
Gaz'd after him, as fowle escapt by flight;<br>
At last him turning to his charge behight,<br>
With trembling hand his troubled pulse gan try;<br>
Where finding life not yet dislodged quight,<br>
He much reioyst, and courd it tenderly,<br>
As chicken newly hatcht, from dreaded destiny.<p>
 
At last he spide, where towards him did pace<br>
Two Paynim knights, all armd as bright as skie,<br>
And them beside an aged Sire did trace,<br>
And farre before a light-foot Page did flie,<br>
That breathed strife and troublous enmitie;<br>
Those were the two sonnes of <i>Acrates</i> old<br>
Who meeting earst with <i>Archimago</i> slie,<br>
Foreby that idle strond, of him were told,<br>
That he, wich earst them combatted, was <i>Guyon</i> bold.<p>
 
Which to auenge on him they dearely vowd,<br>
Where euer that on ground they mote him fynd;<br>
False <i>Archimage</i> prouokt their courage prowd,<br>
And stryfull <i>Atin</i> in their stubborne mynd<br>
Coles of contention and whot vengeance tynd.<br>
Now bene they come, whereas the Palmer sate,<br>
Keeping that slombred corse to him assynd;<br>
Well knew they both his person, sith of late<br>
With him in bloudie armes they rashly did debate.<p>
 
Whom when <i>Pyrrochles</i> saw, inflam'd with rage,<br>
That sire he foule bespake, Thou dotard vile,<br>
That with thy brutenesse shendst thy comely age,<br>
Abandone soone, I read, the caitiue spoile<br>
Of that same outcast carkasse, that erewhile<br>
Made it selfe famous through false trechery,<br>
And crownd his coward crest with knightly stile;<br>
Loe where he now inglorious doth lye,<br>
To proue he liued ill, that did thus foully dye.<p>
 
To whom the Palmer fearelesse answered;<br>
Certes, Sir knight, ye bene too much to blame,<br>
Thus for to blot the honour of the dead,<br>
And with foule cowardize his carkasse shame,<br>
Whose liuing hands immortalizd his name.<br>
Vile is the vengeance on the ashes cold,<br>
And enuie base, to barke at sleeping fame:<br>
Was neuer wight, that treason of him told;<br>
Your selfe his prowesse prou'd &amp; found him fiers &amp; bold.<p>
 
Then said <i>Cymochles</i>; Palmer, thou doest dote,<br>
Ne canst of prowesse, ne of knighthood deeme,<br>
Saue as thou seest or hearst.  But well I wote,<br>
That of his puissance tryall made extreeme;<br>
Yet gold all is not, that doth golden seeme,<br>
Ne all good knights, that shake well speare and shield:<br>
The worth of all men by their end esteeme,<br>
And then due praise, or due reproch them yield;<br>
Bad therefore I him deeme, that thus lies dead on field.<p>
 
Good or bad (gan his brother fierce reply)<br>
What doe I recke, sith that he dyde entire?<br>
Or what doth his bad death now satisfy<br>
The greedy hunger of reuenging ire,<br>
Sith wrathfull hand wrought not her owne desire?<br>
Yet since no way is left to wreake my spight,<br>
I will him reaue of armes, the victors hire,<br>
And of that shield, more worthy of good knight;<br>
For why should a dead dog be deckt in armour bright?<p>
 
Faire Sir, said then the Palmer suppliaunt,<br>
For knighthoods loue, do not so foule a deed,<br>
Ne blame your honour with so shamefull vaunt<br>
Of vile reuenge. To spoile the dead of weed<br>
Is sacrilege, and doth all sinnes exceed;<br>
But leaue these relicks of his liuing might,<br>
To decke his herce, and trap his tomb-blacke steed.<br>
What herce or steed (said he) should he haue dight,<br>
But be entombed in the rauen or the kight?<p>
 
With that, rude hand vpon his shield he laid,<br>
And th'other brother gan his helme vnlace,<br>
Both fiercely bent to haue him disaraid;<br>
Till that they spide, where towards them did pace<br>
An armed knight, of bold and bounteous grace,<br>
Whose squire bore after him an heben launce,<br>
And couerd shield.  Well kend him so farre space<br>
Th'enchaunter by his armes and amenaunce,<br>
When vnder him he saw his Lybian steed to praunce.<p>
 
And to those brethren said, Rise rise by liue,<br>
And vnto battell doe your selues addresse;<br>
For yonder comes the prowest knight aliue,<br>
Prince <i>Arthur</i>, flowre of grace and nobilesse,<br>
That hath to Paynim knights wrought great distresse,<br>
And thousand Sar'zins foully donne to dye.<br>
That word so deepe did in their harts impresse,<br>
That both eftsoones vpstarted furiously,<br>
And gan themselues prepare to battell greedily.<p>
 
But fierce <i>Pyrrochles</i>, lacking his owne sword,<br>
The want thereof now greatly gan to plaine,<br>
And <i>Archimage</i> besought, him that afford,<br>
Which he had brought for <i>Braggadocchio</i> vaine.<br>
So would I (said th'enchaunter) glad and faine<br>
Beteeme to you this sword, you to defend,<br>
Or ought that else your honour might maintaine,<br>
But that this weapons powre I well haue kend,<br>
To be contrarie to the worke, which ye intend.<p>
 
For that same knights owne sword this is of yore,<br>
Which <i>Merlin</i> made by his almightie art<br>
For that his noursling, when he knighthood swore,<br>
Therewith to doen his foes eternall smart.<br>
The metall first he mixt with <i>Med&aelig;wart</i>,<br>
That no enchauntment from his dint might saue;<br>
That it in flames of <i>Aetna</i> wrought apart,<br>
And seuen times dipped in the bitter waue<br>
Of hellish <i>Styx</i>, which hidden vertue to it gaue.<p>
 
The vertue is, that neither steele, nor stone<br>
The stroke thereof from entrance may defend;<br>
Ne euer may be vsed by his fone,<br>
Ne forst his rightfull owner to offend,<br>
Ne euer will it breake, ne euer bend.<br>
Wherefore <i>Morddure</i> it rightfully is hight.<br>
In vaine therefore, <i>Pyrrochles</i>, should I lend<br>
The same to thee, against his lord to fight,<br>
For sure it would deceiue thy labour, and thy might.<p>
 
Foolish old man, said then the Pagan wroth,<br>
That weenest words or charmes may force withstond:<br>
Soone shalt thou see, and then beleeue for troth,<br>
That I can carue with this inchaunted brond<br>
His Lords owne flesh.  Therewith out of his hond<br>
That vertuous steele he rudely snatcht away,<br>
And <i>Guyons</i> shield about his wrest he bond;<br>
So readie dight, fierce battaile to assay,<br>
And match his brother proud in battailous array.<p>
 
By this that straunger knight in presence came,<br>
And goodly salued them; who nought againe<br>
Him answered, as courtesie became,<br>
But with sterne lookes, and stomachous disdaine,<br>
Gaue signes of grudge and discontentment vaine:<br>
Then turning to the Palmer, he gan spy<br>
Where at his feete, with sorrowfull demaine<br>
And deadly hew, an armed corse did lye,<br>
In whose dead face he red great magnanimity.<p>
 
Said he then to the Palmer, Reuerend syre,<br>
What great misfortune hath betidd this knight?<br>
Or did his life her fatall date expyre,<br>
Or did he fall by treason, or by fight?<br>
How euer, sure I rew his pitteous plight.<br>
Not one, nor other, (said the Palmer graue)<br>
Hath him befalne, but cloudes of deadly night<br>
A while his heauie eylids couer'd haue,<br>
And all his senses drowned in deepe senselesse waue.<p>
 
Which, those his cruell foes, that stand hereby,<br>
Making aduantage, to reuenge their spight,<br>
Would him disarme, and treaten shamefully,<br>
Vnworthy vsage of redoubted knight.<br>
But you, faire Sir, whose honorable sight<br>
Doth promise hope of helpe, and timely grace,<br>
Mote I beseech to succour his sad plight,<br>
And by your powre protect his feeble cace.<br>
First praise of knighthood is, foule outrage to deface.<p>
 
Palmer, (said he) no knight so rude, I weene,<br>
As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost:<br>
Ne was there euer noble courage seene,<br>
That in aduauntage would his puissance bost:<br>
Honour is least, where oddes appeareth most.<br>
May be, that better reason will asswage<br>
The rash reuengers heat.  Words well dispost<br>
Haue secret powre, t'appease inflamed rage:<br>
If not, leaue vnto me thy knights last patronage.<p>
 
Tho turning to those brethren, thus bespoke,<br>
Ye warlike payre, whose valorous great might<br>
It seemes, iust wrongs to vengeance doe prouoke,<br>
To wreake your wrath on this dead seeming knight,<br>
Mote ought allay the storme of your despight,<br>
And settle patience in so furious heat?<br>
Not to debate the chalenge of your right,<br>
But for this carkasse pardon I entreat,<br>
Whom fortune hath alreadie laid in lowest seat.<p>
 
To whom <i>Cymochles</i> said; For what art thou,<br>
That mak'st thy selfe his dayes-man, to prolong<br>
The vengeance prest?  Or who shall let me now,<br>
On this vile bodie from to wreake my wrong,<br>
And make his carkasse as the outcast dong?<br>
Why should not that dead carrion satisfie<br>
The guilt, which if he liued had thus long,<br>
His life for due reuenge should deare abie?<br>
The trespasse still doth liue, albe the person die.<p>
 
Indeed (then said the Prince) the euill donne<br>
Dyes not, when breath the bodie first doth leaue,<br>
But from the grandsyre to the Nephewes sonne,<br>
And all his seed the curse doth often cleaue,<br>
Till vengeance vtterly the guilt bereaue:<br>
So streightly God doth iudge.  But gentle knight,<br>
That doth against the dead his hand vpreare,<br>
His honour staines with rancour and despight,<br>
And great disparagment makes to his former might.<p>
 
<i>Pyrrochles</i> gan reply the second time,<br>
And to him said, Now felon sure I read,<br>
How that thou art partaker of his crime:<br>
Therefore by <i>Termagaunt</i> thou shalt be dead.<br>
With that his hand, more sad then lomp of lead,<br>
Vplifting high, he weened with <i>Morddure</i>,<br>
His owne good sword <i>Morddure</i>, to cleaue his head.<br>
The faithfull steele such treason no'uld endure,<br>
But swaruing from the marke, his Lords life did assure.<p>
 
Yet was the force so furious and so fell,<br>
That horse and man it made to reele aside;<br>
Nath'lesse the Prince would not forsake his sell:<br>
For well of yore he learned had to ride,<br>
But full of anger fiercely to him cride;<br>
False traitour miscreant, thou broken hast<br>
The law of armes, to strike foe vndefide.<br>
But thou thy treasons fruit, I hope, shalt taste<br>
Right sowre, &amp; feele the law, the which thou hast defast.<p>
 
With that his balefull speare, he fiercely bent<br>
Against the Pagans brest, and therewith thought<br>
His cursed life out of her lodge haue rent:<br>
But ere the point arriued, where it ought,<br>
That seuen-fold shield, which he from <i>Guyon</i> brought<br>
He cast betwene to ward the bitter stound:<br>
Through all those foldes the steelehead passage wrought<br>
And through his shoulder pierst; wherwith to gro&#361;d<br>
He groueling fell, all gored in his gushing wound.<p>
 
Which when his brother saw, fraught with great griefe<br>
And wrath, he to him leaped furiously,<br>
And fowly said, By <i>Mahoune</i>, cursed thiefe,<br>
That direfull stroke thou dearely shalt aby.<br>
Then hurling vp his harmefull blade on hye,<br>
Smote him so hugely on his haughtie crest,<br>
That from his saddle forced him to fly:<br>
Else mote it needes downe to his manly brest<br>
Haue cleft his head in twaine, and life thence dispossest.<p>
 
Now was the Prince in daungerous distresse,<br>
Wanting his sword, when he on foot should fight:<br>
His single speare could doe him small redresse,<br>
Against two foes of so exceeding might,<br>
The least of which was match for any knight.<br>
And now the other, whom he earst did daunt,<br>
Had reard himselfe againe to cruell fight,<br>
Three times more furious, and more puissaunt,<br>
Vnmindfull of his wound, of his fate ignoraunt.<p>
 
So both attonce him charge on either side,<br>
With hideous strokes, and importable powre,<br>
That forced him his ground to trauerse wide,<br>
And wisely watch to ward that deadly stowre:<br>
For in his shield, as thicke as stormie showre,<br>
Their strokes did raine, yet did he neuer quaile,<br>
Ne backward shrinke, but as a stedfast towre,<br>
Whom foe with double battry doth assaile,<br>
Them on her bulwarke beares, and bids them nought auaile.<p>
 
So stoutly he withstood their strong assay,<br>
Till that at last, when he aduantage spyde,<br>
His poinant speare he thrust with puissant sway<br>
At proud <i>Cymochles</i>, whiles his shield was wyde,<br>
That through his thigh the mortall steele did gryde:<br>
He swaruing with the force, within his flesh<br>
Did breake the launce, and let the head abyde:<br>
Out of the wound the red bloud flowed fresh,<br>
That vnderneath his feet soone made a purple plesh.<p>
 
Horribly then he gan to rage, and rayle,<br>
Cursing his Gods, and himselfe damning deepe:<br>
Als when his brother saw the red bloud rayle<br>
Adowne so fast, and all his armour steepe,<br>
For very felnesse lowd he gan to weepe,<br>
And said, Caytiue, cursse on thy cruell hond,<br>
That twise hath sped; yet shall it not thee keepe<br>
From the third brunt of this my fatall brond:<br>
Loe where the dreadfull Death behind thy backe doth stond.<p>
 
With that he strooke, and th'other strooke withall,<br>
That nothing seem'd mote beare so monstrous might:<br>
The one vpon his couered shield did fall,<br>
And glauncing downe would not his owner byte:<br>
But th'other did vpon his troncheon smyte,<br>
Which hewing quite a sunder, further way<br>
It made, and on his hacqueton did lyte,<br>
The which diuiding with importune sway,<br>
It seizd in his right side, and there the dint did stay.<p>
 
Wyde was the wound, and a large lukewarme flood,<br>
Red as the Rose, thence gushed grieuously;<br>
That when the Paynim spyde the streaming blood,<br>
Gaue him great hart, and hope of victory.<br>
On th'other side, in huge perplexity,<br>
The Prince now stood, hauing his weapon broke;<br>
Nought could he hurt, but still at ward did ly:<br>
Yet with his troncheon he so rudely stroke<br>
<i>Cymochles</i> twise, that twise him forst his foot reuoke.<p>
 
Whom when the Palmer saw in such distresse,<br>
Sir <i>Guyons</i> sword he lightly to him raught,<br>
And said; Faire Son, great God thy right hand blesse,<br>
To vse that sword so wisely as it ought.<br>
Glad was the knight, &amp; with fresh courage fraught,<br>
When as againe he armed felt his hond;<br>
Then like a Lion, which hath long time saught<br>
His robbed whelpes, and at the last them fond<br>
Emongst the shepheard swaynes, then wexeth wood &amp; yond.<p>
 
So fierce he laid about him, and dealt blowes<br>
On either side, that neither mayle could hold,<br>
Ne shield defend the thunder of his throwes:<br>
Now to <i>Pyrrochles</i> many strokes he told;<br>
Eft to <i>Cymochles</i> twise so many fold:<br>
Then backe againe turning his busie hond,<br>
Them both attonce compeld with courage bold,<br>
To yield wide way to his hart-thrilling brond;<br>
And though they both stood stiffe, yet could not both withstond.<p>
 
As saluage Bull, whom two fierce mastiues bayt,<br>
When rancour doth with rage him once engore,<br>
Forgets with warie ward them to awayt,<br>
But with his dreadfull hornes them driues afore,<br>
Or flings aloft, or treads downe in the flore,<br>
Breathing out wrath, and bellowing disdaine,<br>
That all the forrest quakes to heare him rore:<br>
So rag'd Prince <i>Arthur</i> twixt his foemen twaine,<br>
That neither could his mightie puissance sustaine.<p>
 
But euer at <i>Pyrrochles</i> when he smit,<br>
Who <i>Guyons</i> shield cast euer him before,<br>
Whereon the Faery Queenes pourtract was writ,<br>
His hand relented, and the stroke forbore,<br>
And his deare hart the picture gan adore,<br>
Which oft the Paynim sau'd from deadly stowre.<br>
But him henceforth the same can saue no more;<br>
For now arriued is his fatall howre,<br>
That no'te auoyded be by earthly skill or powre.<p>
 
For when <i>Cymochles</i> saw the fowle reproch,<br>
Which them appeached, prickt with guilty shame,<br>
And inward griefe, he fiercely gan approch,<br>
Resolu'd to put away that loathly blame,<br>
Or dye with honour and desert of fame;<br>
And on the hauberk stroke the Prince so sore,<br>
That quite disparted all the linked frame,<br>
And pierced to the skin, but bit no more,<br>
Yet made him twise to reele, that neuer moou'd afore.<p>
 
Whereat renfierst with wrath and sharpe regret,<br>
He stroke so hugely with his borrowd blade,<br>
That it empierst the Pagans burganet,<br>
And cleauing the hard steele, did deepe inuade<br>
Into his head, and cruell passage made<br>
Quite through his braine.  He tombling downe on ground,<br>
Breathd out his ghost, which to th'infernall shade<br>
Fast flying, there eternall torment found,<br>
For all the sinnes, wherewith his lewd life did abound.<p>
 
Which when his german saw, the stony feare<br>
Ran to his hart, and all his sence dismayd,<br>
Ne thenceforth life ne courage did appeare,<br>
But as a man, whom hellish feends haue frayd,<br>
Long trembling still he stood: at last thus sayd;<br>
Traytour what hast thou doen? how euer may<br>
Thy cursed hand so cruelly haue swayd<br>
Against that knight: Harrow and well away,<br>
After so wicked deed why liu'st thou lenger day?<p>
 
With that all desperate as loathing light,<br>
And with reuenge desiring soone to dye,<br>
Assembling all his force and vtmost might,<br>
With his owne sword he fierce at him did flye,<br>
And strooke, and foynd, and lasht outrageously,<br>
Withouten reason or regard.  Well knew<br>
The Prince, with patience and sufferaunce sly<br>
So hasty heat soone cooled to subdew:<br>
Tho when this breathlesse woxe, that batteil gan renew.<p>
 
As when a windy tempest bloweth hye,<br>
That nothing may withstand his stormy stowre,<br>
The cloudes, as things affrayd, before him flye;<br>
But all so soone as his outrageous powre<br>
Is layd, they fiercely then begin to shoure,<br>
And as in scorne of his spent stormy spight,<br>
Now all attonce their malice forth do poure;<br>
So did Sir <i>Guyon</i>[Prince <i>Arthur</i>] beare himselfe in fight,<br>
And suffred rash <i>Pyrrochles</i> wast his idle might.<p>
 
At last when as the Sarazin perceiu'd,<br>
How that straunge sword refusd, to serue his need,<br>
But when he stroke most strong, the dint deceiu'd,<br>
He flong it from him, and deuoyd of dreed,<br>
Vpon him lightly leaping without heed,<br>
Twixt his two mighty armes engrasped fast,<br>
Thinking to ouerthrow and downe him tred:<br>
But him in strength and skill the Prince surpast,<br>
And through his nimble sleight did vnder him down cast.<p>
 
Nought booted it the Paynim then to striue;<br>
For as a Bittur in the Eagles claw,<br>
That may not hope by flight to scape aliue,<br>
Still waites for death with dread and trembling aw;<br>
So he now subiect to the victours law,<br>
Did not once moue, nor vpward cast his eye,<br>
For vile disdaine and rancour, which did gnaw<br>
His hart in twaine with sad melancholy,<br>
As one that loathed life, and yet despisd to dye.<p>
 
But full of Princely bounty and great mind,<br>
The Conquerour nought cared him to slay,<br>
But casting wrongs and all reuenge behind,<br>
More glory thought to giue life, then decay,<br>
And said, Paynim, this is thy dismall day;<br>
Yet if thou wilt renounce thy miscreaunce,<br>
And my trew liegeman yield thy selfe for ay,<br>
Life will I graunt thee for thy valiaunce,<br>
And all thy wrongs will wipe out of my souenaunce.<p>
 
Foole (said the Pagan) I thy gift defye,<br>
But vse thy fortune, as it doth befall,<br>
And say, that I not ouercome do dye,<br>
But in despight of life, for death do call.<br>
Wroth was the Prince, and sory yet withall,<br>
That he so wilfully refused grace;<br>
Yet sith his fate so cruelly did fall,<br>
His shining Helmet he gan soone vnlace,<br>
And left his headlesse body bleeding all the place.<p>
 
By this Sir <i>Guyon</i> from his traunce awakt,<br>
Life hauing maistered her sencelesse foe;<br>
And looking vp, when as his shield he lakt,<br>
And sword saw not, he wexed wondrous woe:<br>
But when the Palmer, whom he long ygoe<br>
Had lost, he by him spide, right glad he grew,<br>
And said, Deare sir, whom wandring to and fro<br>
I long haue lackt, I ioy thy face to vew;<br>
Firme is thy faith, whom daunger neuer fro me drew.<p>
 
But read what wicked hand hath robbed mee<br>
Of my good sword and shield?  The Palmer glad,<br>
With so fresh hew vprising him to see,<br>
Him answered; Faire sonne, be no whit sad<br>
For want of weapons, they shall soone be had.<br>
So gan he to discourse the whole debate,<br>
Which that straunge knight for him sustained had,<br>
And those two Sarazins confounded late,<br>
Whose carcases on ground were horribly prostrate.<p>
 
Which when he heard, and saw the tokens trew,<br>
His hart with great affection was embayd,<br>
And to the Prince bowing with reuerence dew,<br>
As to the Patrone of his life, thus sayd;<br>
My Lord, my liege, by whose most gratious ayd<br>
I liue this day, and see my foes subdewd,<br>
What may suffise, to be for meede repayd<br>
Of so great graces, as ye haue me shewd,<br>
But to be euer bound<p>
 
To whom the Infant thus, Faire Sir, what need<br>
Good turnes be counted, as a seruile bond,<br>
To bind their doers, to receiue their meede?<br>
Are not all knights by oath bound, to withstond<br>
Oppressours powre by armes and puissant hond?<br>
Suffise, that I haue done my dew in place.<br>
So goodly purpose they together fond,<br>
Of kindnesse and of curteous aggrace;<br>
The whiles false <i>Archimarge</i> and <i>Atin</i> fled apace.<p>
