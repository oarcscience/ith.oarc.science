 THE SIXTH<br>  BOOKE OF THE 
<br>  FAERIE QVEENE. <p> 
<i>Contayning</i><br>  THE LEGEND OF S. CALIDORE<br>  
<br> <i>OR</i><br> OF COVRTESIE.</center><p> 

<p>
<blockquote>
T
He waies, through which my weary steps I guyde,<br>
In this delightfull land of Faery,<br>
Are so exceeding spacious and wyde,<br>
And sprinckled with such sweet variety,<br>
Of all that pleasant is to eare or eye,<br>
That I nigh rauisht with rare thoughts delight,<br>
My tedious trauell doe forget thereby;<br>
And when I gin to feele decay of might,<br>
It strength to me supplies, &amp; chears my dulled spright.<p>

Such secret comfort, and such heauenly pleasures,<br>
Ye sacred imps, that on <i>Parnasso</i> dwell,<br>
And there the keeping haue of learnings threasures,<br>
Which doe all worldly riches farre excell,<br>
Into the mindes of mortall men doe well,<br>
And goodly fury into them infuse;<br>
Guyde ye my footing, and conduct me well<br>
In these strange waies, where neuer foote did vse,<br>
Ne none can find, but who was taught them by the Muse.<p>

Reuele to me the sacred noursery<br>
Of vertue, which with you doth there remaine,<br>
Where it in siluer bowre does hidden ly<br>
From view of men, and wicked worlds disdaine.<br>
Since it at first was by the Gods with paine<br>
Planted in earth, being deriu'd at furst<br>
From heauenly seedes of bounty soueraine,<br>
And by them long with carefull labour nurst,<br>
Till it to ripenesse grew, and forth to honour burst.<p>

Amongst them all growes not a fayrer flowre,<br>
Then is the bloosme of comely courtesie,<br>
Which though it on a lowly stalke doe bowre,<br>
Yet brancheth forth in braue nobilitie,<br>
And spreds it selfe through all ciuilitie:<br>
Of which though present age doe plenteous seeme,<br>
Yet being matcht with plaine Antiquitie,<br>
Ye will them all but fayned showes esteeme,<br>
Which carry colours faire, that feeble eies misdeeme.<p>

But in the triall of true curtesie,<br>
Its now so farre from that, which then it was,<br>
That it indeed is nought but forgerie,<br>
Fashion'd to please the eies of them, that pas,<br>
Which see not perfet things but in a glas:<br>
Yet is that glasse so gay, that it can blynd<br>
The wisest sight, to thinke gold that is bras.<br>
But vertues seat is deepe within the mynd,<br>
And not in outward shows, but inward thoughts defynd.<p>

But where shall I in all Antiquity<br>
So faire a patterne finde, where may be seene<br>
The goodly praise of Princely curtesie,<br>
As in your selfe, O soueraine Lady Queene,<br>
In whose pure minde, as in a mirrour sheene<br>
It showes, and with her brightnesse doth inflame<br>
The eyes of all, which thereon fixed beene;<br>
But meriteth indeede an higher name:<br>
Yet so from low to high vplifted is your fame.<p>

Then pardon me, most dreaded Soueraine,<br>
That from your selfe I doe this vertue bring,<br>
And to your selfe doe it returne againe:<br>
So from the Ocean all riuers spring,<br>
And tribute backe repay as to their King.<br>
Right so from you all goodly vertues well<br>
Into the rest, which round about you ring,<br>
Faire Lords and Ladies, which about you dwell,<br>
And doe adorne your Court, where courtesies excell.<p>
