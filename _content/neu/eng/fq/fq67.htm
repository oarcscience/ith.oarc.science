<blockquote>
<i>Calidore sees young Tristram slay<br>
A proud discourteous knight:<br>
He makes him Squire, and of him learnes<br>
his state and present plight.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
VV
Hat vertue is so fitting for a knight,<br>
Or for a Ladie, whom a knight should loue,<br>
As Curtesie, to beare themselues aright<br>
To all of each degree, as doth behoue?<br>
For whether they be placed high aboue,<br>
Or low beneath, yet ought they well to know<br>
Their good, that none them rightly may reproue<br>
Of rudenesse, for not yeelding what they owe:<br>
Great skill it is such duties timely to bestow.<p>

Thereto great helpe dame Nature selfe doth lend:<br>
For some so goodly gratious are by kind,<br>
That euery action doth them much commend,<br>
And in the eyes of men great liking find;<br>
Which others, that haue greater skill in mind,<br>
Though they enforce themselues, cannot attaine.<br>
For euerie thing, to which one is inclin'd,<br>
Doth best become, and greatest grace doth gaine:<br>
Yet praise likewise deserue good thewes, enforst with paine.<p>

That well in courteous <i>Calidore</i> appeares,<br>
Whose euery act and word, that he did say,<br>
Was like enchantment, that through both the eares,<br>
And both the eyes did steale the hart away.<br>
He now againe is on his former way,<br>
To follow his first quest, when as he spyde<br>
A tall young man from thence not farre away,<br>
Fighting on foot, as well he him descryde,<br>
Against an armed knight, that did on horsebacke ryde.<p>

And them beside a Ladie faire he saw,<br>
Standing alone on foot, in foule array:<br>
To whom himselfe he hastily did draw,<br>
To weet the cause of so vncomely fray,<br>
And to depart them, if so be he may.<br>
But ere he came in place, that youth had kild<br>
That armed knight, that low on ground he lay;<br>
Which when he saw, his hart was inly child<br>
With great amazement, &amp; his thought with wonder fild.<p>

Him stedfastly he markt, and saw to bee<br>
A goodly youth of amiable grace,<br>
Yet but a slender slip, that scarse did see<br>
Yet seuenteene yeares, but tall and faire of face<br>
That sure he deem'd him borne of noble race.<br>
All in a woodmans iacket he was clad<br>
Of Lincolne greene, belayd with siluer lace;<br>
And on his head an hood with aglets sprad,<br>
And by his side his hunters horne he hanging had.<p>

Buskins he wore of costliest cordwayne,<br>
Pinckt vpon gold, and paled part per part,<br>
As then the guize was for each gentle swayne;<br>
In his right hand he held a trembling dart,<br>
Whose fellow he before had sent apart;<br>
And in his left he held a sharpe borespeare,<br>
With which he wont to launch the saluage hart<br>
Of many a Lyon, and of many a Beare<br>
That first vnto his hand in chase did happen neare.<p>

Whom <i>Calidore</i> a while well hauing vewed,<br>
At length bespake; What meanes this, gentle swaine?<br>
Why hath thy hand too bold it selfe embrewed<br>
In blood of knight, the which by thee is slaine,<br>
By thee no knight; which armes impugneth plaine?<br>
Certes (said he) loth were I to haue broken<br>
The law of armes; yet breake it should againe,<br>
Rather then let my selfe of wight be stroken,<br>
So long as these two armes were able to be wroken.<p>

For not I him, as this his Ladie here<br>
May witnesse well, did offer first to wrong,<br>
Ne surely thus vnarm'd I likely were;<br>
But he me first, through pride and puissance strong<br>
Assayld, not knowing what to armes doth long.<br>
Perdie great blame, (then said Sir <i>Calidore</i>)<br>
For armed knight a wight vnarm'd to wrong.<br>
But then aread, thou gentle chyld, wherefore<br>
Betwixt you two began this strife and sterne vprore.<p>

That shall I sooth (said he) to you declare.<br>
I whose vnryper yeares are yet vnfit<br>
For thing of weight, or worke of greater care,<br>
Doe spend my dayes, and bend my carelesse wit<br>
To saluage chace, where I thereon may hit<br>
In all this forrest, and wyld wooddie raine:<br>
Where, as this day I was enraunging it,<br>
I chaunst to meete this knight, who there lyes slaine,<br>
Together with this Ladie, passing on the plaine.<p>

The knight, as ye did see, on horsebacke was,<br>
And this his Ladie, (that him ill became,)<br>
On her faire feet by his horse side did pas<br>
Through thicke and thin, vnfit for any Dame.<br>
Yet not content, more to increase his shame,<br>
When so she lagged, as she needs mote so,<br>
He with his speare, that was to him great blame,<br>
Would thumpe her forward, and inforce to goe,<br>
Weeping to him in vaine, and making piteous woe.<p>

Which when I saw, as they me passed by,<br>
Much was I moued in indignant mind,<br>
And gan to blame him for such cruelty<br>
Towards a Ladie, whom with vsage kind<br>
He rather should haue taken vp behind.<br>
Wherewith he wroth, and full of proud disdaine,<br>
Tooke in foule scorne, that I such fault did find,<br>
And me in lieu thereof reuil'd againe,<br>
Threatning to chastize me, as doth t'a chyld pertaine.<p>

Which I no lesse disdayning, backe returned<br>
His scornefull taunts vnto his teeth againe,<br>
That he streight way with haughtie choler burned,<br>
And with his speare strooke me one stroke or twaine;<br>
Which I enforst to beare though to my paine,<br>
Cast to requite, and with a slender dart,<br>
Fellow of this I beare, throwne not in vaine,<br>
Strooke him, as seemeth, vnderneath the hart,<br>
That through the wound his spirit shortly did depart.<p>

Much did Sir <i>Calidore</i> admyre his speach<br>
Tempred so well, but more admyr'd the stroke<br>
That through the mayles had made so strong a breach<br>
Into his hart, and had so sternely wroke<br>
His wrath on him, that first occasion broke.<br>
Yet rested not, but further gan inquire<br>
Of that same Ladie, whether what he spoke,<br>
Were soothly so, and that th'vnrighteous ire<br>
Of her owne knight, had giuen him his owne due hire.<p>

Of all which, when as she could nought deny,<br>
But cleard that stripling of th'imputed blame,<br>
Sayd then Sir <i>Calidore</i>; Neither will I<br>
Him charge with guilt, but rather doe quite clame:<br>
For what he spake, for you he spake it, Dame;<br>
And what he did, he did him selfe to saue:<br>
Against both which that knight wrought knightlesse shame.<br>
For knights and all men this by nature haue,<br>
Towards all womenkind them kindly to behaue.<p>

But sith that he is gone irreuocable,<br>
Please it you Ladie, to vs to aread,<br>
What cause could make him so dishonourable,<br>
To driue you so on foot vnfit to tread,<br>
And lackey by him, gainst all womanhead?<br>
Certes Sir knight (sayd she) full loth I were<br>
To rayse a lyuing blame against the dead:<br>
But since it me concernes, my selfe to clere,<br>
I will the truth discouer, as it chaunst whylere.<p>

This day, as he and I together roade<br>
Vpon our way, to which we weren bent,<br>
We chaunst to come foreby a couert glade<br>
Within a wood, whereas a Ladie gent<br>
Sate with a knight in ioyous iolliment<br>
Of their franke loues, free from all gealous spyes:<br>
Faire was the Ladie sure, that mote content<br>
An hart, not carried with too curious eyes,<br>
And vnto him did shew all louely courtesyes.<p>

Whom when my knight did see so louely faire,<br>
He inly gan her louer to enuy,<br>
And wish, that he part of his spoyle might share.<br>
Whereto when as my presence he did spy<br>
To be a let, he bad me by and by<br>
For to alight: but when as I was loth,<br>
My loues owne part to leaue so suddenly,<br>
He with strong hand down fr&otilde; his steed me throw'th,<br>
And with presumpteous powre against that knight streight go'th.<p>

Vnarm'd all was the knight, as then more meete<br>
For Ladies seruice, and for loues delight,<br>
Then fearing any foeman there to meete:<br>
Whereof he taking oddes, streight bids him dight<br>
Himselfe to yeeld his loue, or else to fight.<br>
Whereat the other starting vp dismayd,<br>
Yet boldly answer'd, as he rightly might;<br>
To leaue his loue he should be ill apayd,<br>
In which he had good right gaynst all, that it gainesayd.<p>

Yet since he was not presently in plight<br>
Her to defend, or his to iustifie,<br>
He him requested, as he was a knight,<br>
To lend him day his better right to trie,<br>
Or stay till he his armes, which were thereby,<br>
Might lightly fetch.  But he was fierce and whot,<br>
Ne time would giue, nor any termes aby,<br>
But at him flew, and with his speare him smot;<br>
From which to thinke to saue himselfe, it booted not.<p>

Meane while his Ladie, which this outrage saw,<br>
Whilest they together for the quarrey stroue,<br>
Into the couert did her selfe withdraw,<br>
And closely hid her selfe within the groue.<br>
My knight hers soone, as seemes, to daunger droue<br>
And left sore wounded: but when her he mist,<br>
He woxe halfe mad, and in that rage gan roue<br>
And range through all the wood, where so he wist<br>
She hidden was, and sought her so long, as him list.<p>

But when as her he by no meanes could find,<br>
After long search and chauff, he turned backe<br>
Vnto the place, where me he left behind:<br>
There gan he me to curse and ban, for lacke<br>
Of that faire bootie, and with bitter wracke<br>
To wreake on me the guilt of his owne wrong.<br>
Of all which I yet glad to beare the packe,<br>
Stroue to appease him, and perswaded long:<br>
But still his passion grew more violent and strong.<p>

Then as it were t'auenge his wrath on mee,<br>
When forward we should fare, he flat refused<br>
To take me vp (as this young man did see)<br>
Vpon his steed, for no iust cause accused,<br>
But forst to trot on foot, and foule misused,<br>
Pounching me with the butt end of his speare,<br>
In vaine complayning, to be so abused.<br>
For he regarded neither playnt nor teare,<br>
But more enforst my paine, the more my plaints to heare.<p>

So passed we, till this young man vs met,<br>
And being moou'd with pittie of my plight,<br>
Spake, as was meet, for ease of my regret:<br>
Whereof befell, what now is in your sight.<br>
Now sure (then said Sir <i>Calidore</i>) and right<br>
Me seemes, that him befell by his owne fault:<br>
Who euer thinkes through confidence of might,<br>
Or through support of count'nance proud and hault<br>
To wrong the weaker, oft falles in his owne assault.<p>

Then turning backe vnto that gentle boy,<br>
Which had himselfe so stoutly well acquit;<br>
Seeing his face so louely sterne and coy,<br>
And hearing th'answeres of his pregnant wit,<br>
He praysd it much, and much admyred it;<br>
That sure he weend him borne of noble blood,<br>
With whom those graces did so goodly fit:<br>
And when he long had him beholding stood,<br>
He burst into these words, as to him seemed good.<p>

Faire gentle swayne, and yet as stout as fayre,<br>
That in these woods amongst the Nymphs dost wonne,<br>
Which daily may to thy sweete lookes repayre,<br>
As they are wont vnto <i>Latonaes</i> sonne,<br>
After his chace on woodie <i>Cynthus</i> donne:<br>
Well may I certes such an one thee read,<br>
As by thy worth thou worthily hast wonne,<br>
Or surely borne of some Heroicke sead,<br>
That in thy face appeares and gratious goodlyhead.<p>

But should it not displease thee it to tell;<br>
(Vnlesse thou in these woods thy selfe conceale,<br>
For loue amongst the woodie Gods to dwell;)<br>
I would thy selfe require thee to reueale,<br>
For deare affection and vnfayned zeale,<br>
Which to thy noble personage I beare,<br>
And wish thee grow in worship and great weale.<br>
For since the day that armes I first did reare,<br>
I neuer saw in any greater hope appeare.<p>

To whom then thus the noble youth; May be<br>
Sir knight, that by discouering my estate,<br>
Harme may arise vnweeting vnto me;<br>
Nathelesse, sith ye so courteous seemed late,<br>
To you I will not feare it to relate.<br>
Then wote ye that I am a Briton borne,<br>
Sonne of a King, how euer thorough fate<br>
Or fortune I my countrie haue forlorne,<br>
And lost the crowne, which should my head by right adorne.<p>

And <i>Tristram</i> is my name, the onely heire<br>
Of good king <i>Meliogras</i> which did rayne<br>
In Cornewale, till that he through liues despeire<br>
Vntimely dyde, before I did attaine<br>
Ripe yeares of reason, my right to maintaine.<br>
After whose death, his brother seeing mee<br>
An infant, weake a kingdome to sustaine,<br>
Vpon him tooke the roiall high degree,<br>
And sent me, where him list, instructed for to bee.<p>

The widow Queene my mother, which then hight<br>
Faire <i>Emiline</i>, conceiuing then great feare<br>
Of my fraile safetie, resting in the might<br>
Of him, that did the kingly Scepter beare,<br>
Whose gealous dread induring not a peare,<br>
Is wont to cut off all, that doubt may breed,<br>
Thought best away me to remoue somewhere<br>
Into some forrein land, where as no need<br>
Of dreaded daunger might his doubtfull humour feed.<p>

So taking counsell of a wise man red,<br>
She was by him aduiz'd, to send me quight<br>
Out of the countrie wherein I was bred,<br>
The which the fertile <i>Lionesse</i> is hight,<br>
Into the land of <i>Faerie</i>, where no wight<br>
Should weet of me, nor worke me any wrong.<br>
To whose wise read she hearkning, sent me streight<br>
Into this land, where I haue wond thus long,<br>
Since I was ten yeares old, now growen to stature strong.<p>

All which my daies I haue not lewdly spent,<br>
Nor spilt the blossome of my tender yeares<br>
In ydlesse, but as was conuenient,<br>
Haue trayned bene with many noble feres<br>
In gentle thewes, and such like seemely leres.<br>
Mongst which my most delight hath alwaies been,<br>
To hunt the saluage chace amongst my peres,<br>
Of all that raungeth in the forrest greene;<br>
Of which none is to me vnknowne, that eu'r was seene.<p>

Ne is there hauke, which mantleth her on pearch,<br>
Whether high towring, or accoasting low,<br>
But I the measure of her flight doe search,<br>
And all her pray, and all her diet know.<br>
Such be our ioyes, which in these forrests grow:<br>
Onely the vse of armes, which most I ioy,<br>
And fitteth most for noble swayne to know,<br>
I haue not tasted yet, yet past a boy,<br>
And being now high time these strong ioynts to imploy.<p>

Therefore, good Sir, sith now occasion fit<br>
Doth fall, whose like hereafter seldome may,<br>
Let me this craue, vnworthy though of it,<br>
That ye will make me Squire without delay,<br>
That from henceforth in batteilous array<br>
I may beare armes, and learne to vse them right;<br>
The rather since that fortune hath this day<br>
Giuen to me the spoile of this dead knight,<br>
These goodly gilden armes, which I haue won in fight.<p>

All which when well Sir <i>Calidore</i> had heard,<br>
Him much more now, then earst he gan admire,<br>
For the rare hope which in his yeares appear'd,<br>
And thus replide; Faire chyld, the high desire<br>
To loue of armes, which in you doth aspire,<br>
I may not certes without blame denie;<br>
But rather wish, that some more noble hire,<br>
(Though none more noble then is cheualrie,)<br>
I had, you to reward with greater dignitie.<p>

There him he causd to kneele, and made to sweare<br>
Faith to his knight, and truth to Ladies all,<br>
And neuer to be recreant, for feare<br>
Of perill, or of ought that might befall:<br>
So he him dubbed, and his Squire did call.<br>
Full glad and ioyous then young <i>Tristram</i> grew,<br>
Like as a flowre, whose silken leaues small,<br>
Long shut vp in the bud from heauens vew,<br>
At length breakes forth, and brode displayes his smyling hew.<p>

Thus when they long had treated to and fro,<br>
And <i>Calidore</i> betooke him to depart,<br>
Chyld <i>Tristram</i> prayd, that he with him might goe<br>
On his aduenture, vowing not to start,<br>
But wayt on him in euery place and part.<br>
Whereat Sir <i>Calidore</i> did much delight,<br>
And greatly ioy'd at his so noble hart,<br>
In hope he sure would proue a doughtie knight:<br>
Yet for the time this answere he to him behight.<p>

Glad would I surely be, thou courteous Squire,<br>
To haue thy presence in my present quest,<br>
That mote thy kindled courage set on fire,<br>
And flame forth honour in thy noble brest:<br>
But I am bound by vow, which I profest<br>
To my dread Soueraine, when I it assayd,<br>
That in atchieuement of her high behest,<br>
I should no creature ioyne vnto mine ayde,<br>
For thy I may not graunt, that ye so greatly prayde.<p>

But since this Ladie is all desolate,<br>
And needeth safegard now vpon her way,<br>
Ye may doe well in this her needfull state<br>
To succour her, from daunger of dismay;<br>
That thankfull guerdon may to you repay.<br>
The noble ympe of such new seruice fayne,<br>
It gladly did accept, as he did say.<br>
So taking courteous leaue, they parted twayne,<br>
And <i>Calidore</i> forth passed to his former payne.<p>

But <i>Tristram</i> then despoyling that dead knight<br>
Of all those goodly implements of prayse,<br>
Long fed his greedie eyes with the faire sight<br>
Of the bright mettall, shyning like Sunne rayes;<br>
Handling and turning them a thousand wayes.<br>
And after hauing them vpon him dight,<br>
He tooke that Ladie, and her vp did rayse<br>
Vpon the steed of her owne late dead knight:<br>
So with her marched forth, as she did him behight.<p>

There to their fortune leaue we them awhile,<br>
And turne we backe to good Sir <i>Calidore</i>;<br>
Who ere he thence had traueild many a mile,<br>
Came to the place, whereas ye heard afore<br>
This knight, whom <i>Tristram</i> slew, had wounded sore<br>
Another knight in his despiteous pryde;<br>
There he that knight found lying on the flore,<br>
With many wounds full perilous and wyde,<br>
That all his garments, and the grasse in vermeill dyde.<p>

And there beside him sate vpon the ground<br>
His wofull Ladie, piteously complayning<br>
With loud laments that most vnluckie stound,<br>
And her sad selfe with carefull hand constrayning<br>
To wype his wounds, and ease their bitter payning.<br>
Which sorie sight when <i>Calidore</i> did vew<br>
With heauie eyne, from teares vneath refrayning,<br>
His mightie hart their mournefull case can rew,<br>
And for their better comfort to them nigher drew.<p>

Then speaking to the Ladie, thus he sayd:<br>
Ye dolefull Dame, let not your griefe empeach<br>
To tell, what cruell hand hath thus arayd<br>
This knight vnarm'd, with so vnknightly breach<br>
Of armes, that if I yet him nigh may reach,<br>
I may auenge him of so foule despight.<br>
The Ladie hearing his so courteous speach,<br>
Gan reare her eyes as to the chearefull light,<br>
And from her sory hart few heauie words forth sigh't.<p>

In which she shew'd, how that discourteous knight<br>
(Whom <i>Tristram</i> slew) them in that shadow found,<br>
Ioying together in vnblam'd delight,<br>
And him vnarm'd, as now he lay on ground,<br>
Charg'd with his speare and mortally did wound,<br>
Withouten cause, but onely her to reaue<br>
From him, to whom she was for euer bound:<br>
Yet when she fled into that couert greaue,<br>
He her not finding, both them thus nigh dead did leaue.<p>

When <i>Calidore</i> this ruefull storie had<br>
Well vnderstood, he gan of her demand,<br>
What manner wight he was, and how yclad,<br>
Which had this outrage wrought with wicked hand.<br>
She then, like as she best could vnderstand,<br>
Him thus describ'd, to be of stature large,<br>
Clad all in gilden armes, with azure band<br>
Quartred athwart, and bearing in his targe<br>
A Ladie on rough waues, row'd in a sommer barge.<p>

Then gan Sir <i>Calidore</i> to ghesse streightway<br>
By many signes, which she described had,<br>
That this was he, whom <i>Tristram</i> earst did slay,<br>
And to her said; Dame be no longer sad:<br>
For he, that hath your Knight so ill bestad,<br>
Is now him selfe in much more wretched plight;<br>
These eyes him saw vpon the cold earth sprad,<br>
The meede of his desert for that despight,<br>
Which to your selfe he wrought, &amp; to your loued knight.<p>

Therefore faire Lady lay aside this griefe,<br>
Which ye haue gathered to your gentle hart,<br>
For that displeasure; and thinke what reliefe<br>
Were best deuise for this your louers smart,<br>
And how ye may him hence, and to what part<br>
Conuay to be recur'd.  She thankt him deare,<br>
Both for that newes he did to her impart,<br>
And for the courteous care, which he did beare<br>
Both to her loue; and to her selfe in that sad dreare.<p>

Yet could she not deuise by any wit,<br>
How thence she might conuay him to some place.<br>
For him to trouble she it thought vnfit,<br>
That was a straunger to her wretched case;<br>
And him to beare, she thought it thing too base.<br>
Which when as he perceiu'd, he thus bespake;<br>
Faire Lady let it not you seeme disgrace,<br>
To beare this burden on your dainty backe;<br>
My selfe will beare a part, coportion of your packe.<p>

So off he did his shield, and downeward layd<br>
Vpon the ground, like to an hollow beare;<br>
And powring balme, which he had long puruayd,<br>
Into his wounds, him vp thereon did reare,<br>
And twixt them both with parted paines did beare,<br>
Twixt life and death, not knowing what was donne.<br>
Thence they him carried to a Castle neare,<br>
In which a worthy auncient Knight did wonne:<br>
Where what ensu'd, shall in next Canto be begonne.<p>
