*Cant. VIII.*

> *Prince Arthure ouercomes Disdaine,  
> Quites Mirabell from dreed:  
> Serena, found of Saluages,  
> By Calepine is freed.*

> Y e gentle Ladies, in whose soueraine powre  
> Loue hath the glory of his kingdome left,  
> And th'hearts of men, as your eternall dowre,  
> In yron chaines, of liberty bereft,  
> Deliuered hath into your hands by gift;  
> Be well aware, how ye the same doe vse,  
> That pride doe not to tyranny you lift;  
> Least if men you of cruelty accuse,  
> He from you take that chiefedome, which ye doe abuse.
>
> And as ye soft and tender are by kynde,  
> Adornd with goodly gifts of beauties grace,  
> So be ye soft and tender eeke in mynde;  
> But cruelty and hardnesse from you chace,  
> That all your other praises will deface,  
> And from you turne the loue of men to hate.  
> Ensample take of *Mirabellaes* case,  
> Who from the high degree of happy state,  
> Fell into wretched woes, which she repented late.
>
> Who after thraldome of the gentle Squire,  
> Which she beheld with lamentable eye,  
> Was touched with compassion entire,  
> And much lamented his calamity,  
> That for her sake fell into misery:  
> Which booted nought for prayers, nor for threat  
> To hope for to release or mollify;  
> For aye the more, that she did them entreat,  
> The more they him misust, and cruelly did beat.
>
> So as they forward on their way did pas,  
> Him still reuiling and afflicting sore,  
> They met Prince *Arthure* with Sir *Enias*,  
> (That was that courteous Knight, whom he before  
> Hauing subdew'd, yet did to life restore,)  
> To whom as they approcht, they gan augment  
> Their cruelty, and him to punish more,  
> Scourging and haling him more vehement;  
> As if it them should grieue to see his punishment.
>
> The Squire him selfe when as he saw his Lord,  
> The witnesse of his wretchednesse, in place,  
> Was much asham'd, that with an hempen cord  
> He like a dog was led in captiue case,  
> And did his head for bashfulnesse abase,  
> As loth to see, or to be seene at all:  
> Shame would be hid. But whenas *Enias*  
> Beheld two such, of two such villaines thrall,  
> His manly mynde was much emmoued therewithall.
>
> And to the Prince thus sayd; See you Sir Knight,  
> The greatest shame that euer eye yet saw?  
> Yond Lady and her Squire with foule despight  
> Abusde, against all reason and all law,  
> Without regard of pitty or of awe.  
> See how they doe that Squire beat and reuile;  
> See how they doe the Lady hale and draw.  
> But if ye please to lend me leaue a while,  
> I will them soone acquite, and both of blame assoile.
>
> The Prince assented, and then he streight way  
> Dismounting light, his shield about him threw,  
> With which approching, thus he gan to say;  
> Abide ye caytiue treachetours vntrew,  
> That haue with treason thralled vnto you  
> These two, vnworthy of your wretched bands;  
> And now your crime with cruelty pursew.  
> Abide, and from them lay your loathly hands;  
> Or else abide the death, that hard before you stands.
>
> The villaine stayd not aunswer to inuent,  
> But with his yron club preparing way,  
> His mindes sad message backe vnto him sent;  
> The which descended with such dreadfull sway,  
> That seemed nought the course thereof could stay:  
> No more then lightening from the lofty sky.  
> Ne list the Knight the powre thereof assay,  
> Whose doome was death, but lightly slipping by,  
> Vnwares defrauded his intended destiny.
>
> And to requite him with the like againe,  
> With his sharpe sword he fiercely at him flew,  
> And strooke so strongly, that the Carle with paine  
> Saued him selfe, but that he there him slew:  
> Yet sau'd not so, but that the bloud it drew,  
> And gaue his foe good hope of victory.  
> Who therewith flesht, vpon him set anew,  
> And with the second stroke, thought certainely  
> To haue supplyde the first, and paide the vsury.
>
> But Fortune aunswerd not vnto his call;  
> For as his hand was heaued vp on hight,  
> The villaine met him in the middle fall,  
> And with his club bet backe his brondyron bright  
> So forcibly, that with his owne hands might  
> Rebeaten backe vpon him selfe againe,  
> He driuen was to ground in selfe despight;  
> From whence ere he recouery could gaine,  
> He in his necke had set his foote with fell disdaine.
>
> With that the foole, which did that end awayte,  
> Came running in, and whilest on ground he lay,  
> Laide heauy hands on him, and held so strayte,  
> That downe he kept him with his scornefull sway,  
> So as he could not weld him any way.  
> The whiles that other villaine went about  
> Him to haue bound, and thrald without delay;  
> The whiles the foole did him reuile and flout,  
> Threatning to yoke them tow & tame their corage stout.
>
> As when a sturdy ploughman with his hynde  
> By strength haue ouerthrowne a stubborne steare,  
> They downe him hold, and fast with cords do bynde,  
> Till they him force the buxome yoke to beare:  
> So did these two this Knight oft tug and teare.  
> Which when the Prince beheld, there standing by,  
> He left his lofty steede to aide him neare,  
> And buckling soone him selfe, gan fiercely fly  
> Vppon that Carle, to saue his friend from ieopardy.
>
> The villaine leauing him vnto his mate  
> To be captiu'd, and handled as he list,  
> Himselfe addrest vnto this new debate,  
> And with his club him all about so blist,  
> That he which way to turne him scarcely wist:  
> Sometimes aloft he layd, sometimes alow;  
> Now here, now there, and oft him neare he mist;  
> So doubtfully, that hardly one could know  
> Whether more wary were to giue or ward the blow.
>
> But yet the Prince so well enured was  
> With such huge strokes, approued oft in fight,  
> That way to them he gaue forth right to pas.  
> Ne would endure the daunger of their might,  
> But wayt aduantage, when they downe did light.  
> At last the caytiue after long discourse,  
> When all his strokes he saw auoyded quite,  
> Resolued in one t'assemble all his force,  
> And make one end of him without ruth or remorse.
>
> His dreadfull hand he heaued vp aloft,  
> And with his dreadfull instrument of yre,  
> Thought sure haue pownded him to powder soft,  
> Or deepe emboweld in the earth entyre:  
> But Fortune did not with his will conspire.  
> For ere his stroke attayned his intent,  
> The noble childe preuenting his desire,  
> Vnder his club with wary boldnesse went,  
> And smote him on the knee, that neuer yet was bent.
>
> It neuer yet was bent, ne bent it now,  
> Albe the stroke so strong and puissant were,  
> That seem'd a marble pillour it could bow:  
> But all that leg, which did his body beare,  
> It crackt throughout, yet did no bloud appeare;  
> So as it was vnable to support  
> So huge a burden on such broken geare,  
> But fell to ground, like to a lumpe of durt;  
> Whence he assayd to rise, but could not for his hurt.
>
> Eftsoones the Prince to him full nimbly stept,  
> And least he should recouer foote againe,  
> His head meant from his shoulders to haue swept.  
> Which when the Lady saw, she cryde amaine;  
> Stay stay, Sir Knight, for loue of God abstaine,  
> From that vnwares ye weetlesse doe intend;  
> Slay not that Carle, though worthy to be slaine:  
> For more on him doth then him selfe depend;  
> My life will by his death haue lamentable end.
>
> He staide his hand according her desire,  
> Yet nathemore him suffred to arize;  
> But still suppressing gan of her inquire,  
> What meaning mote those vncouth words comprize,  
> That in that villaines health her safety lies:  
> That, were no might in man, nor heart in Knights,  
> Which durst her dreaded reskue enterprize,  
> Yet heauens them selues, that fauour feeble rights,  
> Would for it selfe redresse, and punish such despights.
>
> Then bursting forth in teares, which gushed fast  
> Like many water streames, a while she stayd;  
> Till the sharpe passion being ouerpast,  
> Her tongue to her restord, then thus she sayd;  
> Nor heauens, nor men can me most wretched mayd  
> Deliuer from the doome of my desart,  
> The which the God of loue hath on me layd,  
> And damned to endure this direfull smart,  
> For penaunce of my proud and hard rebellious hart.
>
> In prime of youthly yeares, when first the flowre  
> Of beauty gan to bud, and bloosme delight,  
> And nature me endu'd with plenteous dowre,  
> Of all her gifts, that pleasde each liuing sight,  
> I was belou'd of many a gentle Knight,  
> And sude and sought with all the seruice dew:  
> Full many a one for me deepe groand and sigh't,  
> And to the dore of death for sorrow drew,  
> Complayning out on me, that would not on them rew.
>
> But let them loue that list, or liue or die;  
> Me list not die for any louers doole:  
> Ne list me leaue my loued libertie,  
> To pitty him that list to play the foole:  
> To loue my selfe I learned had in schoole.  
> Thus I triumphed long in louers paine,  
> And sitting carelesse on the scorners stoole,  
> Did laugh at those that did lament and plaine:  
> But all is now repayd with interest againe.
>
> For loe the winged God, that woundeth harts,  
> Causde me be called to accompt therefore,  
> And for reuengement of those wrongfull smarts,  
> Which I to others did inflict afore,  
> Addeem'd me to endure this penaunce sore;  
> That in this wize, and this vnmeete array,  
> With these two lewd companions, and no more,  
> *Disdaine* and *Scorne*, I through the world should stray,  
> Till I haue sau'd so many, as I earst did slay.
>
> Certes (sayd then the Prince) the God is iust,  
> That taketh vengeaunce of his peoples spoile.  
> For were no law in loue, but all that lust,  
> Might them oppresse, and painefully turmoile,  
> His kingdome would continue but a while.  
> But tell me Lady, wherefore doe you beare  
> This bottle thus before you with such toile,  
> And eeke this wallet at your backe arreare,  
> That for these Carles to carry much more comely were?
>
> Here in this bottle (sayd the sory Mayd)  
> I put the teares of my contrition,  
> Till to the brim I haue it full defrayd:  
> And in this bag which I behinde me don,  
> I put repentaunce for things past and gon.  
> Yet is the bottle leake, and bag so torne,  
> That all which I put in, fals out anon;  
> And is behinde me trodden downe of *Scorne*,  
> Who mocketh all my paine, & laughs the more I mourn.
>
> The Infant hearkned wisely to her tale,  
> And wondred much at *Cupids* iudg'ment wise,  
> That could so meekly make proud hearts auale,  
> And wreake him selfe on them, that him despise.  
> Then suffred he *Disdaine* vp to arise,  
> Who was not able vp him selfe to reare,  
> By meanes his leg through his late luckelesse prise,  
> Was crackt in twaine, but by his foolish feere  
> Was holpen vp, who him supported standing neare.
>
> But being vp, he lookt againe aloft,  
> As if he neuer had receiued fall;  
> And with sterne eye-browes stared at him oft,  
> As if he would haue daunted him with all:  
> And standing on his tiptoes, to seeme tall,  
> Downe on his golden feete he often gazed,  
> As if such pride the other could apall;  
> Who was so far from being ought amazed,  
> That he his lookes despised, and his boast dispraized.
>
> Then turning backe vnto that captiue thrall,  
> Who all this while stood there beside them bound,  
> Vnwilling to be knowne, or seene at all,  
> He from those bands weend him to haue vnwound.  
> But when approching neare, he plainely found,  
> It was his owne true groome, the gentle Squire,  
> He thereat wext exceedingly astound,  
> And him did oft embrace, and oft admire,  
> Ne could with seeing satisfie his great desire.
>
> Meane while the Saluage man, when he beheld  
> That huge great foole oppressing th'other Knight,  
> Whom with his weight vnweldy downe he held,  
> He flew vpon him, like a greedy kight  
> Vnto some carrion offered to his sight,  
> And downe him plucking, with his nayles and teeth  
> Gan him to hale, and teare, and scratch, and bite;  
> And from him taking his owne whip, therewith  
> So sore him scourgeth, that the bloud downe followeth.
>
> And sure I weene, had not the Ladies cry  
> Procur'd the Prince his cruell hand to stay,  
> He would with whipping, him haue done to dye:  
> But being checkt, he did abstaine streight way,  
> And let him rise. Then thus the Prince gan say;  
> Now Lady sith your fortunes thus dispose,  
> That if ye list haue liberty, ye may,  
> Vnto your selfe I freely leaue to chose,  
> Whether I shall you leaue, or from these villaines lose.
>
> Ah nay Sir Knight (sayd she) it may not be,  
> But that I needes must by all meanes fulfill  
> This penaunce, which enioyned is to me,  
> Least vnto me betide a greater ill;  
> Yet no lesse thankes to you for your good will.  
> So humbly taking leaue, she turnd aside,  
> But *Arthure* with the rest, went onward still  
> On his first quest, in which did him betide  
> A great aduenture, which did him from them deuide.
>
> But first it falleth me by course to tell  
> Of faire *Serena*, who as earst you heard,  
> When first the gentle Squire at variaunce fell  
> With those two Carles, fled fast away, afeard  
> Of villany to be to her inferd:  
> So fresh the image of her former dread,  
> Yet dwelling in her eye, to her appeard,  
> That euery foote did tremble, which did tread,  
> And euery body two, and two she foure did read.
>
> Through hils & dales, through bushes & through breres  
> Long thus she fled, till that at last she thought  
> Her selfe now past the perill of her feares.  
> Then looking round about, and seeing nought,  
> Which doubt of daunger to her offer mought,  
> She from her palfrey lighted on the plaine,  
> And sitting downe, her selfe a while bethought  
> Of her long trauell and turmoyling paine;  
> And often did of loue, and oft of lucke complaine.
>
> And euermore she blamed *Calepine*,  
> The good Sir *Calepine*, her owne true Knight,  
> As th'onely author of her wofull tine:  
> For being of his loue to her so light,  
> As her to leaue in such a piteous plight.  
> Yet neuer Turtle truer to his make,  
> Then he was tride vnto his Lady bright:  
> Who all this while endured for her sake,  
> Great perill of his life, and restlesse paines did take.
>
> Tho when as all her plaints she had displayd,  
> And well disburdened her engrieued brest,  
> Vpon the grasse her selfe adowne she layd;  
> Where being tyrde with trauell, and opprest  
> With sorrow, she betooke her selfe to rest.  
> There whilest in *Morpheus* bosome safe she lay,  
> Fearelesse of ought, that mote her peace molest,  
> False Fortune did her safety betray,  
> Vnto a straunge mischaunce, that menac'd her decay.
>
> In these wylde deserts, where she now abode,  
> There dwelt a saluage nation, which did liue  
> Of stealth and spoile, and making nightly rode  
> Into their neighbours borders; ne did giue  
> Them selues to any trade, as for to driue  
> The painefull plough, or cattell for to breed,  
> Or by aduentrous marchandize to thriue;  
> But on the labours of poore men to feed,  
> And serue their owne necessities with others need.
>
> Thereto they vsde one most accursed order,  
> To eate the flesh of men, whom they mote fynde,  
> And straungers to deuoure, which on their border  
> Were brought by errour, or by wreckfull wynde.  
> A monstrous cruelty gainst course of kynde.  
> They towards euening wandring euery way,  
> To seeke for booty, came by fortune blynde,  
> Whereas this Lady, like a sheepe astray,  
> Now drowned in the depth of sleepe all fearelesse lay.
>
> Soone as they spide her, Lord what gladfull glee  
> They made amongst them selues; but when her face  
> Like the faire yuory shining they did see,  
> Each gan his fellow solace and embrace,  
> For ioy of such good hap by heauenly grace.  
> Then gan they to deuize what course to take:  
> Whether to slay her there vpon the place,  
> Or suffer her out of her sleepe to wake,  
> And then her eate attonce; or many meales to make.
>
> The best aduizement was of bad, to let her  
> Sleepe out her fill, without encomberment:  
> For sleepe they sayd would make her battill better.  
> Then when she wakt, they all gaue one consent,  
> That since by grace of God she there was sent,  
> Vnto their God they would her sacrifize,  
> Whose share, her guiltlesse bloud they would present,  
> But of her dainty flesh they did deuize  
> To make a common feast, & feed with gurmandize.
>
> So round about her they them selues did place  
> Vpon the grasse, and diuersely dispose,  
> As each thought best to spend the lingring space.  
> Some with their eyes the daintest morsels chose;  
> Some praise her paps, some praise her lips and nose;  
> Some whet their kniues, and strip their elboes bare:  
> The Priest him selfe a garland doth compose  
> Of finest flowres, and with full busie care  
> His bloudy vessels wash, and holy fire prepare.
>
> The Damzell wakes, then all attonce vpstart,  
> And round about her flocke, like many flies,  
> Whooping, and hallowing on euery part,  
> As if they would haue rent the brasen skies.  
> Which when she sees with ghastly griefful eies,  
> Her heart does quake, and deadly pallid hew  
> Benumbes her cheekes: Then out aloud she cries,  
> Where none is nigh to heare, that will her rew,  
> And rends her golden locks, and snowy brests embrew.
>
> But all bootes not: they hands vpon her lay;  
> And first they spoile her of her iewels deare,  
> And afterwards of all her rich array;  
> The which amongst them they in peeces teare,  
> And of the pray each one a part doth beare.  
> Now being naked, to their sordid eyes  
> The goodly threasures of nature appeare:  
> Which as they view with lustfull fantasyes,  
> Each wisheth to him selfe, and to the rest enuyes.
>
> Her yuorie necke, her alablaster brest,  
> Her paps, which like white silken pillowes were,  
> For loue in soft delight thereon to rest;  
> Her tender sides, her bellie white and clere,  
> Which like an Altar did it selfe vprere,  
> To offer sacrifice diuine thereon;  
> Her goodly thighes, whose glorie did appeare  
> Like a triumphall Arch, and thereupon  
> The spoiles of Princes hang'd, which were in battel won.
>
> Those daintie parts, the dearlings of delight,  
> Which mote not be prophan'd of common eyes,  
> Those villeins vew'd with loose lasciuious sight,  
> And closely tempted with their craftie spyes;  
> And some of them gan mongst themselues deuize,  
> Thereof by force to take their beastly pleasure.  
> But them the Priest rebuking, did aduize  
> To dare not to pollute so sacred threasure,  
> Vow'd to the gods: religiõ held euen theeues in measure.
>
> So being stayd, they her from thence directed  
> Vnto a litle groue not farre asyde,  
> In which an altar shortly they erected,  
> To slay her on. And now the Euentyde  
> His brode black wings had through the heauens wyde  
> By this dispred, that was the tyme ordayned  
> For such a dismall deed, their guilt to hyde:  
> Of few greene turfes an altar soone they fayned,  
> And deckt it all with flowres, which they nigh hand obtayned.
>
> Tho when as all things readie were aright,  
> The Damzell was before the altar set,  
> Being alreadie dead with fearefull fright.  
> To whom the Priest with naked armes full net  
> Approching nigh, and murdrous knife well whet,  
> Gan mutter close a certaine secret charme,  
> With other diuelish ceremonies met:  
> Which doen he gan aloft t'aduance his arme,  
> Whereat they shouted all, and made a loud alarme.
>
> Then gan the bagpypes and the hornes to shrill,  
> And shrieke aloud, that with the peoples voyce  
> Confused, did the ayre with terror fill,  
> And made the wood to tremble at the noyce:  
> The whyles she wayld, the more they did reioyce.  
> Now mote ye vnderstand that to this groue  
> Sir *Calepine* by chaunce, more then by choyce,  
> The selfe same euening fortune hether droue,  
> As he to seeke *Serena* through the woods did roue.
>
> Long had he sought her, and through many a soyle  
> Had traueld still on foot in heauie armes,  
> Ne ought was tyred with his endlesse toyles,  
> Ne ought was feared of his certaine harmes:  
> And now all weetlesse of the wretched stormes,  
> In which his loue was lost, he slept full fast,  
> Till being waked with these loud alarmes,  
> He lightly started vp like one aghast,  
> And catching vp his arms streight to the noise forth past.
>
> There by th'vncertaine glimse of starry night,  
> And by the twinkling of their sacred fire,  
> He mote perceiue a litle dawning sight  
> Of all, which there was doing in that quire:  
> Mongst whom a woman spoyld of all attire  
> He spyde, lamenting her vnluckie strife,  
> And groning sore from grieued hart entire,  
> Eftsoones he saw one with a naked knife  
> Readie to launce her brest, and let out loued life.
>
> With that he thrusts into the thickest throng,  
> And euen as his right hand adowne descends,  
> He him preuenting, layes on earth along,  
> And sacrifizeth to th'infernall feends.  
> Then to the rest his wrathfull hand he bends,  
> Of whom he makes such hauocke and such hew,  
> That swarmes of damned soules to hell he sends:  
> The rest that scape his sword and death eschew,  
> Fly like a flocke of doues before a Faulcons vew.
>
> From them returning to that Ladie backe,  
> Whom by the Altar he doth sitting find,  
> Yet fearing death, and next to death the lacke  
> Of clothes to couer, what they ought by kind:  
> He first her hands beginneth to vnbind,  
> And then to question of her present woe;  
> And afterwards to cheare with speaches kind.  
> But she for nought that he could say or doe,  
> One word durst speake, or answere him a whit thereto.
>
> So inward shame of her vncomely case  
> She did conceiue, through care of womanhood,  
> That though the night did couer her disgrace,  
> Yet she in so vnwomanly a mood,  
> Would not bewray the state in which she stood.  
> So all that night to him vnknowen she past.  
> But day, that doth discouer bad and good,  
> Ensewing, made her knowen to him at last:  
> The end whereof Ile keepe vntill another cast.
