<blockquote>
<i>The maske of Cupid, and th'enchaunted<br>
Chamber are displayd,<br>
Whence Britomart redeemes faire<br>
Amoret, through charmes decayd.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
T
Ho when as chearelesse Night ycouered had<br>
Faire heauen with an vniuersall cloud,<br>
That euery wight dismayd with darknesse sad,<br>
In silence and in sleepe themselues did shroud,<br>
She heard a shrilling Trompet sound aloud,<br>
Signe of nigh battell, or got victory;<br>
Nought therewith daunted was her courage proud,<br>
But rather stird to cruell enmity,<br>
Expecting euer, when some foe she might descry.<p>

With that, an hideous storme of winde arose,<br>
With dreadfull thunder and lightning atwixt,<br>
And an earth-quake, as if it streight would lose<br>
The worlds foundations from his centre fixt;<br>
A direfull stench of smoke and sulphure mixt<br>
Ensewd, whose noyance fild the fearefull sted,<br>
From the fourth houre of night vntill the sixt;<br>
Yet the bold <i>Britonesse</i> was nought ydred,<br>
Though much emmou'd, but stedfast still perseuered.<p>

All suddenly a stormy whirlwind blew<br>
Throughout the house, that clapped euery dore,<br>
With which that yron wicket open flew,<br>
As it with mightie leuers had bene tore:<br>
And forth issewd, as on the ready flore<br>
Of some Theatre, a graue personage,<br>
That in his hand a branch of laurell bore,<br>
With comely haueour and count'nance sage,<br>
Yclad in costly garments, fit for tragicke Stage.<p>

Proceeding to the midst, he still did stand,<br>
As if in mind he somewhat had to say,<br>
And to the vulgar beckning with his hand,<br>
In signe of silence, as to heare a play,<br>
By liuely actions he gan bewray<br>
Some argument of matter passioned;<br>
Which doen, he backe retyred soft away,<br>
And passing by, his name discouered,<br>
<i>Ease</i>, on his robe in golden letters cyphered.<p>

The noble Mayd, still standing all this vewd,<br>
And merueild at his strange intendiment;<br>
With that a ioyous fellowship issewd<br>
Of Minstrals, making goodly meriment,<br>
With wanton Bardes, and Rymers impudent,<br>
All which together sung full chearefully<br>
A lay of loues delight, with sweet consent:<br>
After whom marcht a iolly company,<br>
In manner of a maske, enranged orderly.<p>

The whiles a most delitious harmony,<br>
In full straunge notes was sweetly heard to sound,<br>
That the rare sweetnesse of the melody<br>
The feeble senses wholly did confound,<br>
And the fraile soule in deepe delight nigh dround:<br>
And when it ceast, shrill trompets loud did bray,<br>
That their report did farre away rebound,<br>
And when they ceast, it gan againe to play,<br>
The whiles the maskers marched forth in trim aray.<p>

The first was <i>Fancy</i>, like a louely boy,<br>
Of rare aspect, and beautie without peare;<br>
Matchable either to that ympe of <i>Troy</i>,<br>
Whom <i>Ioue</i> did loue, and chose his cup to beare,<br>
Or that same daintie lad, which was so deare<br>
To great <i>Alcides</i>, that when as he dyde,<br>
He wailed womanlike with many a teare,<br>
And euery wood, and euery valley wyde<br>
He fild with <i>Hylas</i> name; the Nymphes eke <i>Hylas</i> cryde.<p>

His garment neither was of silke nor say,<br>
But painted plumes, in goodly order dight,<br>
Like as the sunburnt <i>Indians</i> do aray<br>
Their tawney bodies, in their proudest plight:<br>
As those same plumes, so seemd he vaine and light,<br>
That by his gate might easily appeare;<br>
For still he far'd as dauncing in delight,<br>
And in his hand a windy fan did beare,<br>
That in the idle aire he mou'd still here and there.<p>

And him beside marcht amorous <i>Desyre</i>,<br>
Who seemd of riper yeares, then th'other Swaine,<br>
Yet was that other swayne this elders syre,<br>
And gaue him being, commune to them twaine:<br>
His garment was disguised very vaine,<br>
And his embrodered Bonet sat awry;<br>
Twixt both his hands few sparkes he close did straine,<br>
Which still he blew, and kindled busily,<br>
That soone they life conceiu'd, &amp; forth in flames did fly.<p>

Next after him went <i>Doubt</i>, who was yclad<br>
In a discolour'd cote, of straunge disguyse,<br>
That at his backe a brode Capuccio had,<br>
And sleeues dependant <i>Albanese</i>-wyse:<br>
He lookt askew with his mistrustfull eyes,<br>
And nicely trode, as thornes lay in his way,<br>
Or that the flore to shrinke he did auyse,<br>
And on a broken reed he still did stay<br>
His feeble steps, which shrunke, when hard theron he lay.<p>

With him went <i>Daunger</i>, cloth'd in ragged weed,<br>
Made of Beares skin, that him more dreadfull made,<br>
Yet his owne face was dreadfull, ne did need<br>
Straunge horrour, to deforme his griesly shade;<br>
A net in th'one hand, and a rustie blade<br>
In th'other was, this Mischiefe, that Mishap;<br>
With th'one his foes he threatned to inuade,<br>
With th'other he his friends ment to enwrap:<br>
For whom he could not kill, he practizd to entrap.<p>

Next him was <i>Feare</i>, all arm'd from top to toe,<br>
Yet thought himselfe not safe enough thereby,<br>
But feard each shadow mouing to and fro,<br>
And his owne armes when glittering he did spy,<br>
Or clashing heard, he fast away did fly,<br>
As ashes pale of hew, and wingyheeld;<br>
And euermore on daunger fixt his eye,<br>
Gainst whom he alwaies bent a brasen shield,<br>
Which his right hand vnarmed fearefully did wield.<p>

With him went <i>Hope</i> in rancke, a handsome Mayd,<br>
Of chearefull looke and louely to behold;<br>
In silken samite she was light arayd,<br>
And her faire lockes were wouen vp in gold;<br>
She alway smyld, and in her hand did hold<br>
An holy water Sprinckle, dipt in deowe,<br>
With which she sprinckled fauours manifold,<br>
On whom she list, and did great liking sheowe,<br>
Great liking vnto many, but true loue to feowe.<p>

And after them <i>Dissemblance</i>, and <i>Suspect</i><br>
Marcht in one rancke, yet an vnequall paire:<br>
For she was gentle, and of milde aspect,<br>
Courteous to all, and seeming debonaire,<br>
Goodly adorned, and exceeding faire:<br>
Yet was that all but painted, and purloynd,<br>
And her bright browes were deckt with borrowed haire:<br>
Her deedes were forged, and her words false coynd,<br>
And alwaies in her hand two clewes of silke she twynd.<p>

But he was foule, ill fauoured, and grim,<br>
Vnder his eyebrowes looking still askaunce;<br>
And euer as <i>Dissemblance</i> laught on him,<br>
He lowrd on her with daungerous eyeglaunce;<br>
Shewing his nature in his countenance;<br>
His rolling eyes did neuer rest in place,<br>
But walkt each where, for feare of hid mischaunce,<br>
Holding a lattice still before his face,<br>
Through which he still did peepe, as forward he did pace.<p>

Next him went <i>Griefe</i>, and <i>Fury</i> matcht yfere;<br>
<i>Griefe</i> all in sable sorrowfully clad,<br>
Downe hanging his dull head, with heauy chere,<br>
Yet inly being more, then seeming sad:<br>
A paire of Pincers in his hand he had,<br>
With which he pinched people to the hart,<br>
That from thenceforth a wretched life they lad,<br>
In wilfull languor and consuming smart,<br>
Dying each day with inward wounds of dolours dart.<p>

But <i>Fury</i> was full ill appareiled<br>
In rags, that naked nigh she did appeare,<br>
With ghastly lookes and dreadfull drerihed;<br>
For from her backe her garments she did teare,<br>
And from her head oft rent her snarled heare:<br>
In her right hand a firebrand she did tosse<br>
About her head, still roming here and there;<br>
As a dismayed Deare in chace embost,<br>
Forgetfull of his safety, hath his right way lost.<p>

After them went <i>Displeasure</i> and <i>Pleasance</i>,<br>
He looking lompish and full sullein sad,<br>
And hanging downe his heauy countenance;<br>
She chearefull fresh and full of ioyance glad,<br>
As if no sorrow she ne felt ne drad;<br>
That euill matched paire they seemd to bee:<br>
An angry Waspe th'one in a viall had<br>
Th'other in hers an hony-lady Bee;<br>
Thus marched these sixe couples forth in faire degree.<p>

After all these there marcht a most faire Dame,<br>
Led of two grysie villeins, th'one <i>Despight</i>,<br>
The other cleped <i>Cruelty</i> by name:<br>
She dolefull Lady, like a dreary Spright,<br>
Cald by strong charmes out of eternall night,<br>
Had deathes owne image figurd in her face,<br>
Full of sad signes, fearefull to liuing sight;<br>
Yet in that horror shewd a seemely grace,<br>
And with her feeble feet did moue a comely pace.<p>

Her brest all naked, as net iuory,<br>
Without adorne of gold or siluer bright,<br>
Wherewith the Craftesman wonts it beautify,<br>
Of her dew honour was despoyled quight,<br>
And a wide wound therein (O ruefull sight)<br>
Entrenched deepe with knife accursed keene,<br>
Yet freshly bleeding forth her fainting spright,<br>
(The worke of cruell hand) was to be seene,<br>
That dyde in sanguine red her skin all snowy cleene.<p>

At that wide orifice her trembling hart<br>
Was drawne forth, and in siluer basin layd,<br>
Quite through transfixed with a deadly dart,<br>
And in her bloud yet steeming fresh embayd:<br>
And those two villeins, which her steps vpstayd,<br>
When her weake feete could scarcely her sustaine,<br>
And fading vitall powers gan to fade,<br>
Her forward still with torture did constraine,<br>
And euermore encreased her consuming paine.<p>

Next after her the winged God himselfe<br>
Came riding on a Lion rauenous,<br>
Taught to obay the menage of that Elfe,<br>
That man and beast with powre imperious<br>
Subdeweth to his kingdome tyrannous:<br>
His blindfold eyes he bad a while vnbind,<br>
That his proud spoyle of that same dolorous<br>
Faire Dame he might behold in perfect kind;<br>
Which seene, he much reioyced in his cruell mind.<p>

Of which full proud, himselfe vp rearing hye,<br>
He looked round about with sterne disdaine;<br>
And did suruay his goodly company:<br>
And marshalling the euill ordered traine,<br>
With that the darts which his right hand did straine,<br>
Full dreadfully he shooke that all did quake,<br>
And clapt on hie his coulourd winges twaine,<br>
That all his many it affraide did make:<br>
Tho blinding him againe, his way he forth did take.<p>

Behinde him was <i>Reproch</i>, <i>Repentance</i>, <i>Shame</i>;<br>
<i>Reproch</i> the first, <i>Shame</i> next, <i>Repent</i> behind:<br>
<i>Repentance</i> feeble, sorrowfull, and lame:<br>
<i>Reproch</i> despightfull, carelesse, and vnkind;<br>
<i>Shame</i> most ill fauourd, bestiall, and blind:<br>
<i>Shame</i> lowrd, <i>Repentance</i> sigh'd, <i>Reproch</i> did scould;<br>
<i>Reproch</i> sharpe stings, <i>Repentance</i> whips entwind,<br>
<i>Shame</i> burning brond-yrons in her hand did hold:<br>
All three to each vnlike, yet all made in one mould.<p>

And after them a rude confused rout<br>
Of persons flockt, whose names is hard to read:<br>
Emongst them was sterne <i>Strife</i>, and <i>Anger</i> stout,<br>
Vnquiet <i>Care</i>, and fond <i>Vnthriftihead</i>,<br>
Lewd <i>Losse of Time</i>, and <i>Sorrow</i> seeming dead,<br>
Inconstant <i>Chaunge</i>, and false <i>Disloyaltie</i>,<br>
Consuming <i>Riotise</i>, and guilty <i>Dread</i><br>
Of heauenly vengeance, faint <i>Infirmitie</i>,<br>
Vile <i>Pouertie</i>, and lastly <i>Death</i> with infamie.<p>

There were full many moe like maladies,<br>
Whose names and natures I note readen well;<br>
So many moe, as there be phantasies<br>
In wauering wemens wit, that none can tell,<br>
Or paines in loue, or punishments in hell;<br>
All which disguized marcht in masking wise,<br>
About the chamber with that Damozell,<br>
And then returned, hauing marched thrise,<br>
Into the inner roome, from whence they first did rise.<p>

So soone as they were in, the dore streight way<br>
Fast locked, driuen with that stormy blast,<br>
Which first it opened; and bore all away.<br>
Then the braue Maid, which all this while was plast,<br>
In secret shade, and saw both first and last,<br>
Issewed forth, and went vnto the dore,<br>
To enter in, but found it locked fast:<br>
It vaine she thought with rigorous vprore<br>
For to efforce, when charmes had closed it afore.<p>

Where force might not auaile, their sleights and art<br>
She cast to vse, both fit for hard emprize;<br>
For thy, from that same roome not to depart<br>
Till morrow next, she did her selfe auize,<br>
When that same Maske againe should forth arize.<br>
The morrow next appeard with ioyous cheare,<br>
Calling men to their daily exercize,<br>
Then she, as morrow fresh, her selfe did reare<br>
Out of her secret stand, that day for to out weare.<p>

All that day she outwore in wandering,<br>
And gazing on that Chambers ornament,<br>
Till that againe the second euening<br>
Her couered with her sable vestiment,<br>
Wherewith the worlds faire beautie she hath blent:<br>
Then when the second watch was almost past,<br>
That brasen dore flew open, and in went<br>
Bold <i>Britomart</i>, as she had late forecast,<br>
Neither of idle shewes, nor of false charmes aghast.<p>

So soone as she was entred, round about<br>
She cast her eies, to see what was become<br>
Of all those persons, which she saw without:<br>
But lo, they streight were vanisht all and some,<br>
Ne liuing wight she saw in all that roome,<br>
Saue that same woefull Ladie, both whose hands<br>
Were bounden fast, that did her ill become,<br>
And her small wast girt round with yron bands,<br>
Vnto a brasen pillour, by the which she stands.<p>

And her before the vile Enchaunter sate,<br>
Figuring straunge characters of his art,<br>
With liuing bloud he those characters wrate,<br>
Dreadfully dropping from her dying hart,<br>
Seeming transfixed with a cruell dart,<br>
And all perforce to make her him to loue.<br>
Ah who can loue the worker of her smart?<br>
A thousand charmes he formerly did proue;<br>
Yet thousand charmes could not her stedfast heart remoue.<p>

Soone as that virgin knight he saw in place,<br>
His wicked bookes in hast he ouerthrew,<br>
Not caring his long labours to deface,<br>
And fiercely ronning to that Lady trew,<br>
A murdrous knife out of his pocket drew,<br>
The which he thought, for villeinous despight,<br>
In her tormented bodie to embrew:<br>
But the stout Damzell to him leaping light,<br>
His cursed hand withheld, and maistered his might.<p>

From her, to whom his fury first he ment,<br>
The wicked weapon rashly he did wrest,<br>
And turning to her selfe his fell intent,<br>
Vnwares it strooke into her snowie chest,<br>
That little drops empurpled her faire brest.<br>
Exceeding wroth therewith the virgin grew,<br>
Albe the wound were nothing deepe imprest,<br>
And fiercely forth her mortall blade she drew,<br>
To giue him the reward for such vile outrage dew.<p>

So mightily she smote him, that to ground<br>
He fell halfe dead; next stroke him should haue slaine,<br>
Had not the Lady, which by him stood bound,<br>
Dernely vnto her called to abstaine,<br>
From doing him to dy.  For else her paine<br>
Should be remedilesse, sith none but hee,<br>
Which wrought it, could the same recure againe.<br>
Therewith she stayd her hand, loth stayd to bee;<br>
For life she him enuyde, and long'd reuenge to see.<p>

And to him said, Thou wicked man, whose meed<br>
For so huge mischiefe, and vile villany<br>
Is death, or if that ought do death exceed,<br>
Be sure, that nought may saue thee from to dy,<br>
But if that thou this Dame doe presently<br>
Restore vnto her health, and former state;<br>
This doe and liue, else die vndoubtedly.<br>
He glad of life, that lookt for death but late,<br>
Did yield himselfe right willing to prolong his date.<p>

And rising vp, gan streight to ouerlooke,<br>
Those cursed leaues, his charmes backe to reuerse;<br>
Full dreadfull things out of that balefull booke<br>
He red, and measur'd many a sad verse,<br>
That horror gan the virgins hart to perse,<br>
And her faire locks vp stared stiffe on end,<br>
Hearing him those same bloudy lines reherse;<br>
And all the while he red, she did extend<br>
Her sword high ouer him, if ought he did offend.<p>

Anon she gan perceiue the house to quake,<br>
And all the dores to rattle round about;<br>
Yet all that did not her dismaied make,<br>
Nor slacke her threatfull hand for daungers dout,<br>
But still with stedfast eye and courage stout<br>
Abode, to weet what end would come of all.<br>
At last that mightie chaine, which round about<br>
Her tender waste was wound, adowne gan fall,<br>
And that great brasen pillour broke in peeces small.<p>

The cruell steele, which thrild her dying hart,<br>
Fell softly forth, as of his owne accord,<br>
And the wyde wound, which lately did dispart<br>
Her bleeding brest, and riuen bowels gor'd,<br>
Was closed vp, as it had not bene bor'd,<br>
And euery part to safety full sound,<br>
As she were neuer hurt, was soone restor'd:<br>
Tho when she felt her selfe to be vnbound,<br>
And perfect hole, prostrate she fell vnto the ground.<p>

Before faire <i>Britomart</i>, she fell prostrate,<br>
Saying, Ah noble knight, what worthy meed<br>
Can wretched Lady, quit from wofull state,<br>
Yield you in liew of this your gratious deed?<br>
Your vertue selfe her owne reward shall breed,<br>
Euen immortall praise, and glory wyde,<br>
Which I your vassall, by your prowesse freed,<br>
Shall through the world make to be notifyde,<br>
And goodly well aduance, that goodly well was tryde.<p>

But <i>Britomart</i> vprearing her from ground,<br>
Said, Gentle Dame, reward enough I weene<br>
For many labours more, then I haue found,<br>
This, that in safety now I haue you seene,<br>
And meane of your deliuerance haue beene:<br>
Henceforth faire Lady comfort to you take,<br>
And put away remembrance of late teene;<br>
In stead thereof know, that your louing Make,<br>
Hath no lesse griefe endured for your gentle sake.<p>

She much was cheard to heare him mentiond,<br>
Whom of all liuing wights she loued best.<br>
Then laid the noble Championesse strong hond<br>
Vpon th'enchaunter, which had her distrest<br>
So sore, and with foule outrages opprest:<br>
With that great chaine, wherewith not long ygo<br>
He bound that pitteous Lady prisoner, now relest,<br>
Himselfe she bound, more worthy to be so,<br>
And captiue with her led to wretchednesse and wo.<p>

Returning backe, those goodly roomes, which erst<br>
She saw so rich and royally arayd,<br>
Now vanisht vtterly, and cleane subuerst<br>
She found, and all their glory quite decayd,<br>
That sight of such a chaunge her much dismayd.<br>
Thence forth descending to that perlous Porch,<br>
Those dreadfull flames she also found delayd,<br>
And quenched quite, like a consumed torch,<br>
That erst all entrers wont so cruelly to scorch.<p>

More easie issew now, then entrance late<br>
She found: for now that fained dreadfull flame,<br>
Which chokt the porch of that enchaunted gate,<br>
And passage bard to all, that thither came,<br>
Was vanisht quite, as it were not the same,<br>
And gaue her leaue at pleasure forth to passe.<br>
Th'Enchaunter selfe, which all that fraud did frame,<br>
To haue efforst the loue of that faire lasse,<br>
Seeing his worke now wasted deepe engrieued was.<p>

But when the victoresse arriued there,<br>
Where late she left the pensife <i>Scudamore</i>,<br>
With her owne trusty Squire, both full of feare,<br>
Neither of them she found where she them lore:<br>
Thereat her noble hart was stonisht sore;<br>
But most faire <i>Amoret</i>, whose gentle spright<br>
Now gan to feede on hope, which she before<br>
Conceiued had, to see her owne dear knight,<br>
Being thereof beguyld was fild with new affright.<p>

But he sad man, when he had long in drede<br>
Awayted there for <i>Britomarts</i> returne,<br>
Yet saw her not nor signe of her good speed,<br>
His expectation to despaire did turne,<br>
Misdeeming sure that her those flames did burne;<br>
And therefore gan aduize with her old Squire,<br>
Who her deare nourslings losse no lesse did mourne,<br>
Thence to depart for further aide t'enquire:<br>
Where let them wend at will, whilest here I doe respire.<p>

<blockquote>
At last she came vnto the place, where late<br>
She left Sir <i>Scudamour</i> in great distresse,<br>
Twixt dolour and despight halfe desperate,<br>
Of his loues succour, of his owne redresse,<br>
And of the hardie <i>Britomarts</i> successe:<br>
There on the cold earth him now thrown she found,<br>
In wilfull anguish, and dead heauinesse,<br>
And to him cald; whose voices knowen sound<br>
Soone as he heard, himself he reared light from ground.<p>

There did he see, that most on earth him ioyd,<br>
His dearest loue, the comfort of his dayes,<br>
Whose too long absence him had sore annoyd,<br>
And wearied his life with dull delayes:<br>
Straight he vpstarted from the loathed layes,<br>
And to her ran with hasty egernesse,<br>
Like as a Deare, that greedily embayes<br>
In the coole soile, after long thirstinesse,<br>
Which he in chace endured hath, now nigh breathlesse.<p>

Lightly he clipt her twixt his armes twaine,<br>
And streightly did embrace her body bright,<br>
Her body, late the prison of sad paine,<br>
Now the sweet lodge of loue and deare delight:<br>
But she faire Lady ouercommen quight<br>
Of huge affection, did in pleasure melt,<br>
And in sweete rauishment pourd out her spright:<br>
No word they spake, nor earthly thing they felt,<br>
But like two senceles stocks in long embracem&#7869;t dwelt.<p>

Had ye them seene, ye would haue surely thought,<br>
That they had beene that faire <i>Hermaphrodite</i>,<br>
Which that rich <i>Romane</i> of white marble wrought,<br>
And in his costly Bath causd to bee site:<br>
So seemd those two, as growne together quite,<br>
That <i>Britomart</i> halfe enuying their b[l]esse,<br>
Was much empassiond in her gentle sprite,<br>
And to her selfe oft wisht like happinesse,<br>
In vaine she wisht, that fate n'ould let her yet possesse.<p>

Thus doe those louers with sweet counteruayle,<br>
Each other of loues bitter fruit despoile.<br>
But now my teme begins to faint and fayle,<br>
All woxen weary of their iournall toyle:<br>
Therefore I will their sweatie yokes assoyle,<br>
At this same furrowes end, till a new day:<br>
And ye faire swayns, after your long turmoyle,<br>
Now cease your worke, and at your pleasure play:<br>
Now cease your worke; to morrow is an holy day.<p>
