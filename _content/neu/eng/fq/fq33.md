*Cant. VII.*

> *The witches sonne loues Florimell:  
> she flyes, he faines to die.  
> Satyrane saues the Squire of Dames  
> from Gyants tyrannie.*

> L Ike as an Hynd forth singled from the heard,  
> That hath escaped from a rauenous beast,  
> Yet flyes away of her owne feet affeard,  
> And euery leafe, that shaketh with the least  
> Murmure of winde, her terror hath encreast;  
> So fled faire *Florimell* from her vaine feare,  
> Long after she from perill was releast:  
> Each shade she saw, and each noyse she did heare,  
> Did seeme to be the same, which she escapt whyleare.
>
> All that same euening she in flying spent,  
> And all that night her course continewed:  
> Ne did she let dull sleepe once to relent,  
> Nor wearinesse to slacke her hast, but fled  
> Euer alike, as if her former dred  
> Were hard behind, her readie to arrest:  
> And her white Palfrey hauing conquered  
> The maistring raines out of her weary wrest,  
> Perforce her carried, where euer he thought best.
>
> So long as breath, and hable puissance  
> Did natiue courage vnto him supply,  
> His pace he freshly forward did aduaunce,  
> And carried her beyond all ieopardy,  
> But nought that wanteth rest, can long aby.  
> He hauing through incessant trauell spent  
> His force, at last perforce a downe did ly,  
> Ne foot could further moue: the Lady gent  
> Thereat was suddein strooke with great astonishment.
>
> And forst t'alight, on foot mote algates fare,  
> A traueller vnwonted to such way:  
> Need teacheth her this lesson hard and rare,  
> That fortune all in equall launce doth sway,  
> And mortall miseries doth make her play.  
> So long she trauelled, till at length she came  
> To an hilles side, which did to her bewray  
> A little valley, subiect to the same,  
> All couerd with thick woods, that quite it ouercame.
>
> Through the tops of the high trees she did descry  
> A litle smoke, whose vapour thin and light,  
> Reeking aloft, vprolled to the sky:  
> Which, chearefull signe did send vnto her sight,  
> That in the same did wonne some liuing wight.  
> Eftsoones her steps she thereunto applyde,  
> And came at last in weary wretched plight  
> Vnto the place, to which her hope did guyde,  
> To find some refuge there, and rest her weary syde.
>
> There in a gloomy hollow glen she found  
> A little cottage, built of stickes and reedes  
> In homely wize, and wald with sods around,  
> In which a witch did dwell, in loathly weedes,  
> And wilfull want, all carelesse of her needes;  
> So choosing solitarie to abide,  
> Far from all neighbours, that her deuilish deedes  
> And hellish arts from people she might hide,  
> And hurt far off vnknowne, whom euer she enuide.
>
> The Damzell there arriuing entred in;  
> Where sitting on the flore the Hag she found,  
> Busie (as seem'd) about some wicked gin:  
> Who soone as she beheld that suddein stound,  
> Lightly vpstarted from the dustie ground,  
> And with fell looke and hollow deadly gaze  
> Stared on her awhile, as one astound,  
> Ne had one word to speake, for great amaze,  
> But shewd by outward signes, that dread her sence did daze.
>
> At last turning her feare to foolish wrath,  
> She askt, what deuill had her thither brought,  
> And who she was, and what vnwonted path  
> Had guided her, vnwelcomed, vnsought?  
> To which the Damzell full of doubtfull thought,  
> Her mildly answer'd; Beldame be not wroth  
> With silly Virgin by aduenture brought  
> Vnto your dwelling, ignorant and loth,  
> That craue but rowme to rest, while tempest ouerblo'th.
>
> With that adowne out of her Christall eyne  
> Few trickling teares she softly forth let fall,  
> That like two Orient pearles, did purely shyne  
> Vpon her snowy cheeke; and therewithall  
> She sighed soft, that none so bestiall,  
> Nor saluage hart, but ruth of her sad plight  
> Would make to melt, or pitteously appall;  
> And that vile Hag, all were her whole delight  
> In mischiefe, was much moued at so pitteous sight.
>
> And gan recomfort her in her rude wyse,  
> With womanish compassion of her plaint,  
> Wiping the teares from her suffused eyes,  
> And bidding her sit downe, to rest her faint  
> And wearie limbs a while. She nothing quaint  
> Nor s'deignfull of so homely fashion,  
> Sith brought she was now to so hard constraint,  
> Sate downe vpon the dusty ground anon,  
> As glad of that small rest, as Bird of tempest gon.
>
> Tho gan she gather vp her garments rent,  
> And her loose lockes to dight in order dew,  
> With golden wreath and gorgeous ornament;  
> Whom such whenas the wicked Hag did vew,  
> She was astonisht at her heauenly hew,  
> And doubted her to deeme an earthly wight,  
> But or some Goddesse, or of *Dianes* crew,  
> And thought her to adore with humble spright;  
> T'adore thing so diuine as beauty, were but right.
>
> This wicked woman had a wicked sonne,  
> The comfort of her age and weary dayes,  
> A laesie loord, for nothing good to donne,  
> But stretched forth in idlenesse alwayes,  
> Ne euer cast his mind to couet prayse,  
> Or ply him selfe to any honest trade,  
> But all the day before the sunny rayes  
> He vs'd to slug, or sleepe in slothfull shade:  
> Such laesinesse both lewd and poore attonce him made.
>
> He comming home at vndertime, there found  
> The fairest creature, that he euer saw,  
> Sitting beside his mother on the ground;  
> The sight whereof did greatly him adaw,  
> And his base thought with terrour and with aw  
> So inly smot, that as one, which had gazed  
> On the bright Sunne vnwares, doth soone withdraw  
> His feeble eyne, with too much brightnesse dazed,  
> So stared he on her, and stood long while amazed.
>
> Softly at last he gan his mother aske,  
> What mister wight that was, and whence deriued,  
> That in so straunge disguizement there did maske,  
> And by what accident she there arriued:  
> But she, as one nigh of her wits depriued,  
> With nought but ghastly lookes him answered,  
> Like to a ghost, that lately is reuiued  
> From *Stygian* shores, where late it wandered;  
> So both at her, and each at other wondered.
>
> But the faire Virgin was so meeke and mild,  
> That she to them vouchsafed to embace  
> Her goodly port, and to their senses vild,  
> Her gentle speach applide, that in short space  
> She grew familiare in that desert place.  
> During which time, the Chorle through her so kind  
> And curteise vse conceiu'd affection bace,  
> And cast to loue her in his brutish mind;  
> No loue, but brutish lust, that was so beastly tind.
>
> Closely the wicked flame his bowels brent,  
> And shortly grew into outrageous fire;  
> Yet had he not the hart, nor hardiment,  
> As vnto her to vtter his desire;  
> His caytiue thought durst not so high aspire,  
> But with soft sighes, and louely semblaunces,  
> He ween'd that his affection entire  
> She should aread; many resemblaunces  
> To her he made, and many kind remembraunces.
>
> Oft from the forrest wildings he did bring,  
> Whose sides empurpled were with smiling red,  
> And oft young birds, which he had taught to sing  
> His mistresse prayses, sweetly caroled,  
> Girlonds of flowres sometimes for her faire hed  
> He fine would dight; sometimes the squirell wild  
> He brought to her in bands, as conquered  
> To be her thrall, his fellow seruant vild;  
> All which, she of him tooke with countenance meeke and mild.
>
> But past awhile, when she fit season saw  
> To leaue that desert mansion, she cast  
> In secret wize her selfe thence to withdraw,  
> For feare of mischiefe, which she did forecast  
> Might by the witch or by her sonne compast:  
> Her wearie Palfrey closely, as she might,  
> Now well recouered after long repast,  
> In his proud furnitures she freshly dight,  
> His late miswandred wayes now to remeasure right.
>
> And earely ere the dawning day appeard,  
> She forth issewed, and on her iourney went;  
> She went in perill, of each noyse affeard,  
> And of each shade, that did it selfe present;  
> For still she feared to be ouerhent,  
> Of that vile hag, or her vnciuile sonne:  
> Who when too late awaking, well they kent,  
> That their faire guest was gone, they both begonne  
> To make exceeding mone, as they had bene vndonne.
>
> But that lewd louer did the most lament  
> For her depart, that euer man did heare;  
> He knockt his brest with desperate intent,  
> And scratcht his face, and with his teeth did teare  
> His rugged flesh, and rent his ragged heare:  
> That his sad mother seeing his sore plight,  
> Was greatly woe begon, and gan to feare,  
> Least his fraile senses were emperisht quight,  
> And loue to frenzy turnd, sith loue is franticke hight.
>
> All wayes she sought, him to restore to plight,  
> With herbs, with charms, with coũsell, & with teares,  
> But tears, nor charms, nor herbs, nor counsell might  
> Asswage the fury, which his entrails teares:  
> So strong is passion, that no reason heares.  
> Tho when all other helpes she saw to faile,  
> She turnd her selfe backe to her wicked leares  
> And by her deuilish arts thought to preuaile,  
> To bring her backe againe, or worke her finall bale.
>
> Eftsoones out of her hidden caue she cald  
> An hideous beast, of horrible aspect,  
> That could the stoutest courage haue appald;  
> Monstrous mishapt, and all his backe was spect  
> With thousand spots of colours queint elect,  
> Thereto so swift, that it all beasts did pas:  
> Like neuer yet did liuing eye detect;  
> But likest it to an *Hyena* was,  
> That feeds on womens flesh, as others feede on gras.
>
> It forth she cald, and gaue it streight in charge,  
> Through thicke and thin her to pursew apace,  
> Ne once to stay to rest, or breath at large,  
> Till her he had attaind, and brought in place,  
> Or quite deuourd her beauties scornefull grace.  
> The Monster swift as word, that from her went,  
> Went forth in hast, and did her footing trace  
> So sure and swiftly, through his perfect scent,  
> And passing speede, that shortly he her ouerhent.
>
> Whom when the fearefull Damzell nigh espide,  
> No need to bid her fast away to flie;  
> That vgly shape so sore her terrifide,  
> That it she shund no lesse, then dread to die,  
> And her flit Palfrey did so well apply  
> His nimble feet to her conceiued feare,  
> That whilest his breath did strength to him supply,  
> From perill free he her away did beare:  
> But when his force gan faile, his pace gan wex areare.
>
> Which whenas she perceiu'd, she was dismayd  
> At that same last extremitie full sore,  
> And of her safetie greatly grew afrayd;  
> And now she gan approch to the sea shore,  
> As it befell, that she could flie no more,  
> But yield her selfe to spoile of greedinesse.  
> Lightly she leaped, as a wight forlore,  
> From her dull horse, in desperate distresse,  
> And to her feet betooke her doubtfull sickernesse.
>
> Not halfe so fast the wicked *Myrrha* fled  
> From dread of her reuenging fathers hond:  
> Nor halfe so fast to saue her maidenhed,  
> Fled fearefull *Daphne* on th'*Ægæan* strond,  
> As *Florimell* fled from that Monster yond,  
> To reach the sea, ere she of him were raught:  
> For in the sea to drowne her selfe she fond,  
> Rather then of the tyrant to be caught:  
> Thereto feare gaue her wings, and neede her courage taught.
>
> It fortuned (high God did so ordaine)  
> As she arriued on the roring shore,  
> In minde to leape into the mighty maine,  
> A little boate lay houing her before,  
> In which there slept a fisher old and pore,  
> The whiles his nets were drying on the sand:  
> Into the same she leapt, and with the ore  
> Did thrust the shallop from the floting strand:  
> So safetie found at sea, which she found not at land.
>
> The Monster ready on the pray to sease,  
> Was of his forward hope deceiued quight;  
> Ne durst assay to wade the perlous seas,  
> But greedily long gaping at the sight,  
> At last in vaine was forst to turne his flight,  
> And tell the idle tidings to his Dame:  
> Yet to auenge his deuilish despight,  
> He set vpon her Palfrey tired lame,  
> And slew him cruelly, ere any reskew came.
>
> And after hauing him embowelled,  
> To fill his hellish gorge, it chaunst a knight  
> To passe that way, as forth he trauelled;  
> It was a goodly Swaine, and of great might,  
> As euer man that bloudy field did fight;  
> But in vaine sheows, that wont yongknights bewitch,  
> And courtly seruices tooke no delight,  
> But rather ioyd to be, then seemen sich:  
> For both to be and seeme to him was labour lich.
>
> It was to weete the good Sir *Satyrane*,  
> That raungd abroad to seeke aduentures wilde,  
> As was his wont in forrest, and in plaine;  
> He was all armd in rugged steele vnfilde,  
> As in the smoky forge it was compilde,  
> And in his Scutchin bore a Satyres hed:  
> He comming present, where the Monster vilde  
> Vpon that milke-white Palfreyes carkas fed,  
> Vnto his reskew ran, and greedily him sped.
>
> There well perceiu'd he, that it was the horse,  
> Whereon faire *Florimell* was wont to ride,  
> That of that feend was rent without remorse:  
> Much feared he, least ought did ill betide  
> To that faire Mayd, the flowre of womens pride;  
> For her he dearely loued, and in all  
> His famous conquests highly magnifide:  
> Besides her golden girdle, which did fall  
> From her in flight, he found, that did him sore apall.
>
> Full of sad feare, and doubtfull agony,  
> Fiercely he flew vpon that wicked feend,  
> And with huge strokes, and cruell battery  
> Him forst to leaue his pray, for to attend  
> Him selfe from deadly daunger to defend:  
> Full many wounds in his corrupted flesh  
> He did engraue, and muchell bloud did spend,  
> Yet might not do him dye, but aye more fresh  
> And fierce he still appeard, the more he did him thresh.
>
> He wist not, how him to despoile of life,  
> Ne how to win the wished victory,  
> Sith him he saw still stronger grow through strife,  
> And him selfe weaker through infirmity;  
> Greatly he grew enrag'd, and furiously  
> Hurling his sword away, he lightly lept  
> Vpon the beast, that with great cruelty  
> Rored, and raged to be vnder-kept:  
> Yet he perforce him held, and strokes vpon him hept.
>
> As he that striues to stop a suddein flood,  
> And in strong banckes his violence enclose,  
> Forceth it swell aboue his wonted mood,  
> And largely ouerflow the fruitfull plaine,  
> That all the countrey seemes to be a Maine,  
> And the rich furrowes flote, all quite fordonne:  
> The wofull husbandman doth lowd complaine,  
> To see his whole yeares labour lost so soone,  
> For which to God he made so many an idle boone.
>
> So him he held, and did through might amate:  
> So long he held him, and him bet so long,  
> That at the last his fiercenesse gan abate,  
> And meekely stoup vnto the victour strong:  
> Who to auenge the implacable wrong,  
> Which he supposed donne to *Florimell*,  
> Sought by all meanes his dolour to prolong,  
> Sith dint of steele his carcas could not quell:  
> His maker with her charmes had framed him so well.
>
> The golden ribband, which that virgin wore  
> About her sclender wast, he tooke in hand,  
> And with it bound the beast, that lowd did rore  
> For great despight of that vnwonted band,  
> Yet dared not his victour to withstand,  
> But trembled like a lambe, fled from the pray,  
> And all the way him followd on the strand,  
> As he had long bene learned to obay;  
> Yet neuer learned he such seruice, till that day.
>
> Thus as he led the Beast along the way,  
> He spide far off a mighty Giauntesse,  
> Fast flying on a Courser dapled gray,  
> From a bold knight, that with great hardinesse  
> Her hard pursewd, and sought for to suppresse;  
> She bore before her lap a dolefull Squire,  
> Lying athwart her horse in great distresse,  
> Fast bounden hand and foote with cords of wire,  
> Whom she did meane to make the thrall of her desire.
>
> Which whenas *Satyrane* beheld, in hast  
> He left his captiue Beast at liberty,  
> And crost the nearest way, by which he cast  
> Her to encounter, ere she passed by:  
> But she the way shund nathemore for thy,  
> But forward gallopt fast; which when he spyde,  
> His mighty speare he couched warily,  
> And at her ran: she hauing him descryde,  
> Her selfe to fight addrest, and threw her lode aside.
>
> Like as a Goshauke, that in foote doth beare  
> A trembling Culuer, hauing spide on hight  
> An Egle, that with plumy wings doth sheare  
> The subtile ayre, stouping with all his might,  
> The quarrey throwes to ground with fell despight,  
> And to the battell doth her selfe prepare:  
> So ran the Geauntesse vnto the fight;  
> Her firie eyes with furious sparkes did stare,  
> And with blasphemous bannes high God in peeces tare.
>
> She caught in hand an huge great yron mace,  
> Wherewith she many had of life depriued,  
> But ere the stroke could seize his aymed place,  
> His speare amids her sun-broad shield arriued;  
> Yet nathemore the steele a sunder riued,  
> All were the beame in bignesse like a mast,  
> Ne her out of the stedfast sadle driued,  
> But glauncing on the tempred mettall, brast  
> In thousand shiuers, and so forth beside her past.
>
> Her Steed did stagger with that puissaunt strooke;  
> But she no more was moued with that might,  
> Then it had lighted on an aged Oke;  
> Or on the marble Pillour, that is pight  
> Vpon the top of Mount *Olympus* hight,  
> For the braue youthly Champions to assay,  
> With burning charet wheeles it nigh to smite:  
> But who that smites it, mars his ioyous play,  
> And is the spectacle of ruinous decay.
>
> Yet therewith sore enrag'd, with sterne regard  
> Her dreadfull weapon she to him addrest,  
> Which on his helmet martelled so hard,  
> That made him low incline his lofty crest,  
> And bowd his battred visour to his brest:  
> Wherewith he was so stund, that he n'ote ryde,  
> But reeled to and fro from East to West:  
> Which when his cruell enimy espyde,  
> She lightly vnto him adioyned side to syde;
>
> And on his collar laying puissant hand,  
> Out of his wauering seat him pluckt perforse,  
> Perforse him pluckt, vnable to withstand,  
> Or helpe himselfe, and laying thwart her horse,  
> In loathly wise like to a carion corse,  
> She bore him fast away. Which when the knight,  
> That her pursewed, saw with great remorse,  
> He neare was touched in his noble spright,  
> And gan encrease his speed, as she encreast her flight.
>
> Whom when as nigh approching she espyde,  
> She threw away her burden angrily;  
> For she list not the battell to abide,  
> But made her selfe more light, away to fly:  
> Yet her the hardy knight pursewd so nye,  
> That almost in the backe he oft her strake:  
> But still when him at hand she did espy,  
> She turnd, and semblaunce of faire fight did make;  
> But when he stayd, to flight againe she did her take.
>
> By this the good Sir *Satyrane* gan wake  
> Out of his dreame, that did him long entraunce,  
> And seeing none in place, he gan to make  
> Exceeding mone, and curst that cruell chaunce,  
> Which reft from him so faire a cheuisaunce:  
> At length he spide, whereas that wofull Squire,  
> Whom he had reskewed from captiuaunce  
> Of his strong foe, lay tombled in the myre,  
> Vnable to arise, or foot or hand to styre.
>
> To whom approching, well he mote perceiue  
> In that foule plight a comely personage,  
> And louely face, made fit for to deceiue  
> Fraile Ladies hart with loues consuming rage,  
> Now in the blossome of his freshest age:  
> He reard him vp, and loosd his yron bands,  
> And after gan inquire his parentage,  
> And how he fell into that Gyaunts hands,  
> And who that was, which chaced her along the lands.
>
> Then trembling yet through feare, the Squire bespake,  
> That Geauntesse *Argante* is behight,  
> A daughter of the *Titans* which did make  
> Warre against heauen, and heaped hils on hight,  
> To scale the skyes, and put *Ioue* from his right:  
> Her sire *Typhoeus* was, who mad through merth,  
> And drunke with bloud of men, slaine by his might,  
> Through incest, her of his owne mother Earth  
> Whilome begot, being but halfe twin of that berth.
>
> For at that berth another Babe she bore,  
> To weet the mighty *Ollyphant*, that wrought  
> Great wreake to many errant knights of yore,  
> And many hath to foule confusion brought.  
> These twinnes, men say, (a thing far passing thought)  
> Whiles in their mothers wombe enclosd they were,  
> Ere they into the lightsome world were brought,  
> In fleshly lust were mingled both yfere,  
> And in that monstrous wise did to the world appere.
>
> So liu'd they euer after in like sin,  
> Gainst natures law, and good behauioure:  
> But greatest shame was to that maiden twin,  
> Who not content so fowly to deuoure  
> Her natiue flesh, and staine her brothers bowre,  
> Did wallow in all other fleshly myre,  
> And suffred beasts her body to deflowre:  
> So whot she burned in that lustfull fyre,  
> Yet all that might not slake her sensuall desyre.
>
> But ouer all the countrey she did raunge,  
> To seeke young men, to quench her flaming thurst,  
> And feed her fancy with delightfull chaunge:  
> Whom so she fittest finds to serue her lust,  
> Through her maine strength, in which she most doth trust,  
> She with her brings into a secret Ile,  
> Where in eternall bondage dye he must,  
> Or be the vassall of her pleasures vile,  
> And in all shamefull sort him selfe with her defile.
>
> Me seely wretch she so at vauntage caught,  
> After she long in waite for me did lye,  
> And meant vnto her prison to haue brought,  
> Her lothsome pleasure there to satisfye;  
> That thousand deathes me leuer were to dye,  
> Then breake the vow, that to faire *Columbell*  
> I plighted haue, and yet keepe stedfastly:  
> As for my name, it mistreth not to tell;  
> Call me the *Squyre of Dames* that me beseemeth well.
>
> But that bold knight, whom ye pursuing saw  
> That Geauntesse, is not such, as she seemed,  
> But a faire virgin, that in martiall law,  
> And deedes of armes aboue all Dames is deemed,  
> And aboue many knights is eke esteemed,  
> For her great worth; she *Palladine* is hight:  
> She you from death, you me from dread redeemed.  
> Ne any may that Monster match in fight,  
> But she, or such as she, that is so chaste a wight.
>
> Her well beseemes that Quest (quoth *Satyrane*)  
> But read, thou *Squyre of Dames*, what vow is this,  
> Which thou vpon thy selfe hast lately ta'ne?  
> That shall I you recount (quoth he) ywis,  
> So be ye pleasd to pardon all amis.  
> That gentle Lady, whom I loue and serue,  
> After long suit and weary seruicis,  
> Did aske me, how I could her loue deserue,  
> And how she might be sure, that I would neuer swerue.
>
> I glad by any meanes her grace to gaine,  
> Bad her commaund my life to saue, or spill.  
> Eftsoones she bad me, with incessaunt paine  
> To wander through the world abroad at will,  
> And euery where, where with my power or skill  
> I might do seruice vnto gentle Dames,  
> That I the same should faithfully fulfill,  
> And at the twelue monethes end should bring their names  
> And pledges; as the spoiles of my victorious games.
>
> So well I to faire Ladies seruice did,  
> And found such fauour in their louing hartes,  
> That ere the yeare his course had compassid,  
> Three hundred pledges for my good desartes,  
> And thrise three hundred thanks for my good partes  
> I with me brought, and did to her present:  
> Which when she saw, more bent to eke my smartes,  
> Then to reward my trusty true intent,  
> She gan for me deuise a grieuous punishment.
>
> To weet, that I my trauell should resume,  
> And with like labour walke the world around,  
> Ne euer to her presence should presume,  
> Till I so many other Dames had found,  
> The which, for all the suit I could propound,  
> Would me refuse their pledges to afford,  
> But did abide for euer chast and sound.  
> Ah gentle Squire (quoth he) tell at one word,  
> How many foundst thou such to put in thy record?
>
> In deed Sir knight (said he) one word may tell  
> All, that I euer found so wisely stayd;  
> For onely three they were disposd so well,  
> And yet three yeares I now abroad haue strayd,  
> To find them out. Mote I (then laughing sayd  
> The knight) inquire of thee, what were those three,  
> The which thy proffred curtesie denayd?  
> Or ill they seemed sure auizd to bee,  
> Or brutishly brought vp, that neu'r did fashions see.
>
> The first which then refused me (said hee)  
> Certes was but a common Courtisane,  
> Yet flat refusd to haue a do with mee,  
> Because I could not giue her many a Iane.  
> (Thereat full hartely laughed *Satyrane*.)  
> The second was an holy Nunne to chose,  
> Which would not let me be her Chappellane,  
> Because she knew, she said, I would disclose  
> Her counsell, if he should her trust in me repose.
>
> The third a Damzell was of low degree,  
> Whom I in countrey cottage found by chaunce;  
> Full little weened I, that chastitee  
> Had lodging in so meane a maintenaunce,  
> Yet was she faire, and in her countenance  
> Dwelt simple truth in seemely fashion.  
> Long thus I woo'd her with dew obseruance,  
> In hope vnto my pleasure to haue won;  
> But was as farre at last, as when I first begon.
>
> Safe her, I neuer any woman found,  
> That chastity did for it selfe embrace,  
> But were for other causes firme and sound;  
> Either for want of handsome time and place,  
> Or else for feare of shame and fowle disgrace.  
> Thus am I hopelesse euer to attaine  
> My Ladies loue, in such a desperate case,  
> But all my dayes am like to wast in vaine,  
> Seeking to match the chaste with th'vnchaste Ladies traine.
>
> Perdy, (said *Satyrane*) thou *Squire of Dames*,  
> Great labour fondly hast thou hent in hand,  
> To get small thankes, and therewith many blames,  
> That may emongst *Alcides* labours stand.  
> Thence backe returning to the former land,  
> Where late he left the Beast, he ouercame,  
> He found him not; for he had broke his band,  
> And was return'd againe vnto his Dame,  
> To tell what tydings of faire *Florimell* became.
