<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>Marin for loue of Florimell,<br>
In languor wastes his life:<br>
The Nymph his mother getteth her,<br>
And giues to him for wife.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
O
 What an endlesse worke haue I in hand,<br>
To count the seas abundant progeny,<br>
Whose fruitfull seede farre passeth those in land,<br>
And also those which wonne in th'azure sky?<br>
For much more eath to tell the starres on hy,<br>
Albe they endlesse seeme in estimation,<br>
Then to recount the Seas posterity:<br>
So fertile be the flouds in generation,<br>
So huge their numbers, and so numberlesse their nation.<p>

Therefore the antique wisards well inuented,<br>
That <i>Venus</i> of the fomy sea was bred;<br>
For that the seas by her are most augmented.<br>
Witnesse th'exceeding fry, which there are fed,<br>
And wondrous sholes, which may of none be red.<br>
Then blame me not, if I haue err'd in count<br>
Of Gods, of Nymphs, of riuers yet vnred:<br>
For though their numbers do much more surmount,<br>
Yet all those same were there, which erst I did recount.<p>

All those were there, and many other more,<br>
Whose names and nations were too long to tell,<br>
That <i>Proteus</i> house they fild euen to the dore;<br>
Yet were they all in order, as befell,<br>
According their degrees disposed well.<br>
Amongst the rest, was faire <i>Cymodoce</i>,<br>
The mother of vnlucky <i>Marinell</i>,<br>
Who thither with her came, to learne and see<br>
The manner of the Gods when they at banquet bee.<p>

But for he was halfe mortall, being bred<br>
Of mortall sire, though of immortall wombe,<br>
He might not with immortall food be fed,<br>
Ne with th'eternall Gods to bancket come;<br>
But walkt abrode, and round about did rome,<br>
To view the building of that vncouth place,<br>
That seem'd vnlike vnto his earthly home:<br>
Where, as he to and fro by chaunce did trace,<br>
There vnto him betid a disauentrous case.<p>

Vnder the hanging of an hideous clieffe,<br>
He heard the lamentable voice of one,<br>
That piteously complaind her carefull grieffe,<br>
Which neuer she before disclosd to none,<br>
But to her selfe her sorrow did bemone.<br>
So feelingly her case she did complaine,<br>
That ruth it moued in the rocky stone,<br>
And made it seeme to feele her grieuous paine,<br>
And oft to grone with billowes beating from the maine.<p>

Though vaine I see my sorrowes to vnfold,<br>
And count my cares, when none is nigh to heare,<br>
Yet hoping griefe may lessen being told,<br>
I will them tell though vnto no man neare:<br>
For heauen that vnto all lends equall eare,<br>
Is farre from hearing of my heauy plight;<br>
And lowest hell, to which I lie most neare,<br>
Cares not what euils hap to wretched wight;<br>
And greedy seas doe in the spoile of life delight.<p>

Yet loe the seas I see by often beating,<br>
Doe pearce the rockes, and hardest marble weares;<br>
But his hard rocky hart for no entreating<br>
Will yeeld, but when my piteous plaints he heares,<br>
Is hardned more with my aboundant teares.<br>
Yet though he neuer list to me relent,<br>
But let me waste in woe my wretched yeares,<br>
Yet will I neuer of my loue repent,<br>
But ioy that for his sake I suffer prisonment.<p>

And when my weary ghost with griefe outworne,<br>
By timely death shall winne her wished rest,<br>
Let then this plaint vnto his eares be borne,<br>
That blame it is to him, that armes profest,<br>
To let her die, whom he might haue redrest.<br>
There did she pause, inforced to giue place,<br>
Vnto the passion, that her heart opprest,<br>
And after she had wept and wail'd a space,<br>
She gan afresh thus to renew her wretched case.<p>

Ye Gods of seas, if any Gods at all<br>
Haue care of right, or ruth of wretches wrong,<br>
By one or other way me woefull thrall,<br>
Deliuer hence out of this dungeon strong,<br>
In which I daily dying am too long.<br>
And if ye deeme me death for louing one,<br>
That loues not me, then doe it not prolong,<br>
But let me die and end my daies attone,<br>
And let him liue vnlou'd, or loue him selfe alone.<p>

But if that life ye vnto me decree,<br>
Then let mee liue, as louers ought to do,<br>
And of my lifes deare loue beloued be:<br>
And if he shall through pride your doome vndo,<br>
Do you by duresse him compell thereto,<br>
And in this prison put him here with me:<br>
One prison fittest is to hold vs two:<br>
So had I rather to be thrall, then free;<br>
Such thraldome or such freedome let it surely be.<p>

But O vaine iudgement, and conditions vaine,<br>
The which the prisoner points vnto the free,<br>
The whiles I him condemne, and deeme his paine,<br>
He where he list goes loose, and laughes at me.<br>
So euer loose, so euer happy be.<br>
But where so loose or happy that thou art,<br>
Know <i>Marinell</i> that all this is for thee.<br>
With that she wept and wail'd, as if her hart<br>
Would quite haue burst through great abundance of her smart.<p>

All which complaint when <i>Marinell</i> had heard,<br>
And vnderstood the cause of all her care<br>
To come of him, for vsing her so hard,<br>
His stubborne heart, that neuer felt misfare<br>
Was toucht with soft remorse and pitty rare;<br>
That euen for griefe of minde he oft did grone,<br>
And inly wish, that in his powre it weare<br>
Her to redresse: but since he meanes found none<br>
He could no more but her great misery bemone.<p>

Thus whilst his stony heart with tender ruth<br>
Was toucht, and mighty courage mollifide,<br>
Dame <i>Venus</i> sonne that tameth stubborne youth<br>
With iron bit, and maketh him abide,<br>
Till like a victor on his backe he ride,<br>
Into his mouth his maystring bridle threw,<br>
That made him stoupe, till he did him bestride:<br>
Then gan he make him tread his steps anew,<br>
And learne to loue, by learning louers paines to rew.<p>

Now gan he in his grieued minde deuise,<br>
How from that dungeon he might her enlarge:<br>
Some while he thought, by faire and humble wise<br>
To <i>Proteus</i> selfe to sue for her discharge:<br>
But then he fear'd his mothers former charge<br>
Gainst womens loue, long giuen him in vaine.<br>
Then gan he thinke, perforce with sword and targe<br>
Her forth to fetch, and <i>Proteus</i> to constraine:<br>
But soone he gan such folly to forthinke againe.<p>

Then did he cast to steale her thence away,<br>
And with him beare, where none of her might know.<br>
But all in vaine: for why he found no way<br>
To enter in, or issue forth below:<br>
For all about that rocke the sea did flow.<br>
And though vnto his will she giuen were,<br>
Yet without ship or bote her thence to row,<br>
He wist not how her thence away to bere;<br>
And daunger well he wist long to continue there.<p>

At last when as no meanes he could inuent,<br>
Backe to him selfe he gan returne the blame,<br>
That was the author of her punishment;<br>
And with vile curses, and reprochfull shame<br>
To damne him selfe by euery euill name;<br>
And deeme vnworthy or of loue or life,<br>
That had despisde so chast and faire a dame,<br>
Which him had sought through trouble &amp; l&otilde;g strife;<br>
Yet had refusde a God that her had sought to wife.<p>

In this sad plight he walked here and there,<br>
And romed round about the rocke in vaine,<br>
As he had lost him selfe, he wist not where;<br>
Oft listening if he mote her heare againe;<br>
And still bemoning her vnworthy paine.<br>
Like as an Hynde whose calfe is falne vnwares<br>
Into some pit, where she him heares complaine,<br>
An hundred times about the pit side fares,<br>
Right sorrowfully mourning her bereaued cares.<p>

And now by this the feast was throughly ended,<br>
And euery one gan homeward to resort.<br>
Which seeing <i>Marinell</i>, was sore offended,<br>
That his departure thence should be so short,<br>
And leaue his loue in that sea-walled fort.<br>
Yet durst he not his mother disobay,<br>
But her attending in full seemly sort,<br>
Did march amongst the many all the way:<br>
And all the way did inly mourne, like one astray.<p>

Being returned to his mothers bowre,<br>
In solitary silence far from wight,<br>
He gan record the lamentable stowre,<br>
In which his wretched loue lay day and night,<br>
For his deare sake, that ill deseru'd that plight:<br>
The thought whereof empierst his hart so deepe,<br>
That of no worldly thing he tooke delight;<br>
Ne dayly food did take, ne nightly sleepe,<br>
But pyn'd, &amp;; mourn'd, &amp; languisht, and alone did weepe.<p>

That in short space his wonted chearefull hew<br>
Gan fade, and liuely spirits deaded quight:<br>
His cheeke bones raw, and eie-pits hollow grew,<br>
And brawney armes had lost their knowen might,<br>
That nothing like himselfe he seem'd in sight.<br>
Ere long so weake of limbe, and sicke of loue<br>
He woxe, that lenger he note stand vpright,<br>
But to his bed was brought, and layd aboue,<br>
Like ruefull ghost, vnable once to stirre or moue.<p>

Which when his mother saw, she in her mind<br>
Was troubled sore, ne wist well what to weene,<br>
Ne could by search nor any meanes out find<br>
The secret cause and nature of his teene,<br>
Whereby she might apply some medicine;<br>
But weeping day and night, did him attend,<br>
And mourn'd to see her losse before her eyne,<br>
Which grieu'd her more, that she it could not mend:<br>
To see an helpelesse euill, double griefe doth lend.<p>

Nought could she read the roote of his disease,<br>
Ne weene what mister maladie it is,<br>
Whereby to seeke some meanes it to appease.<br>
Most did she thinke, but most she thought amis,<br>
That that same former fatall wound of his<br>
Whyleare by <i>Tryphon</i> was not throughly healed,<br>
But closely rankled vnder th'orifis:<br>
Least did she thinke, that which he most concealed,<br>
That loue it was, which in his hart lay vnreuealed.<p>

Therefore to <i>Tryphon</i> she againe doth hast,<br>
And him doth chyde as false and fraudulent,<br>
That fayld the trust, which she in him had plast,<br>
To cure her sonne, as he his faith had lent:<br>
Who now was falne into new languishment<br>
Of his old hurt, which was not throughly cured.<br>
So backe he came vnto her patient;<br>
Where searching euery part, her well assured,<br>
That it was no old sore, which his new paine procured.<p>

But that it was some other maladie,<br>
Or griefe vnknowne, which he could not discerne:<br>
So left he her withouten remedie.<br>
Then gan her heart to faint, and quake, and earne,<br>
And inly troubled was, the truth to learne.<br>
Vnto himselfe she came, and him besought,<br>
Now with faire speches, now with threatnings sterne,<br>
If ought lay hidden in his grieued thought,<br>
It to reueale: who still her answered, there was nought.<p>

Nathlesse she rested not so satisfide,<br>
But leauing watry gods, as booting nought,<br>
Vnto the shinie heauen in haste she hide,<br>
And thence <i>Apollo</i> King of Leaches brought.<br>
<i>Apollo</i> came; who soone as he had sought<br>
Through his disease, did by and by out find,<br>
That he did languish of some inward thought,<br>
The which afflicted his engrieued mind;<br>
Which loue he red to be, that leads each liuing kind.<p>

Which when he had vnto his mother told,<br>
She gan thereat to fret, and greatly grieue.<br>
And comming to her sonne, gan first to scold,<br>
And chyde at him, that made her misbelieue:<br>
But afterwards she gan him soft to shrieue,<br>
And wooe with faire intreatie, to disclose,<br>
Which of the Nymphes his heart so sore did mieue.<br>
For sure she weend it was some one of those,<br>
Which he had lately seene, that for his loue he chose.<p>

Now lesse she feared that same fatall read,<br>
That warned him of womens loue beware:<br>
Which being ment of mortall creatures sead,<br>
For loue of Nymphes she thought she need not care,<br>
But promist him, what euer wight she weare,<br>
That she her loue to him would shortly gaine:<br>
So he her told: but soone as she did heare<br>
That <i>Florimell</i> it was, which wrought his paine,<br>
She gan a fresh to chafe, and grieue in euery vaine.<p>

Yet since she saw the streight extremitie,<br>
In which his life vnluckily was layd,<br>
It was no time to scan the prophecie,<br>
Whether old <i>Proteus</i> true or false had sayd,<br>
That his decay should happen by a mayd.<br>
It's late in death of daunger to aduize,<br>
Or loue forbid him, that is life denayd:<br>
But rather gan in troubled mind deuize,<br>
How she that Ladies libertie might enterprize.<p>

To <i>Proteus</i> selfe to sew she thought it vaine,<br>
Who was the root and worker of her woe:<br>
Nor vnto any meaner to complaine,<br>
But vnto great king <i>Neptune</i> selfe did goe,<br>
And on her knee before him falling lowe,<br>
Made humble suit vnto his Maiestie,<br>
To graunt to her, her sonnes life, which his foe<br>
A cruell Tyrant had presumpteouslie<br>
By wicked doome condemn'd, a wretched death to die.<p>

To whom God <i>Neptune</i> softly smyling, thus;<br>
Daughter me seemes of double wrong ye plaine,<br>
Gainst one that hath both wronged you, and vs:<br>
For death t'adward I ween'd did appertaine<br>
To none, but to the seas sole Soueraine.<br>
Read therefore who it is, which this hath wrought,<br>
And for what cause; the truth discouer plaine.<br>
For neuer wight so euill did or thought,<br>
But would some rightfull cause pretend, though rightly nought.<p>

To whom she answerd, Then it is by name<br>
<i>Proteus</i>, that hath ordayn'd my sonne to die;<br>
For that a waift, the which by fortune came<br>
Vpon your seas, he claym'd as propertie:<br>
And yet nor his, nor his in equitie,<br>
But yours the waift by high prerogatiue.<br>
Therefore I humbly craue your Maiestie,<br>
It to repleuie, and my sonne repriue:<br>
So shall you by one gift saue all vs three aliue.<p>

He graunted it: and streight his warrant made,<br>
Vnder the Sea-gods seale autenticall,<br>
Commaunding <i>Proteus</i> straight t'enlarge the mayd,<br>
Which wandring on his seas imperiall,<br>
He lately tooke, and sithence kept as thrall.<br>
Which she receiuing with meete thankefulnesse,<br>
Departed straight to <i>Proteus</i> therewithall:<br>
Who reading it with inward loathfulnesse,<br>
Was grieued to restore the pledge, he did possesse.<p>

Yet durst he not the warrant to withstand,<br>
But vnto her deliuered <i>Florimell</i>.<br>
Whom she receiuing by the lilly hand,<br>
Admyr'd her beautie much, as she mote well:<br>
For she all liuing creatures did excell;<br>
And was right ioyous, that she gotten had<br>
So faire a wife for her sonne <i>Marinell</i>.<br>
So home with her she streight the virgin lad,<br>
And shewed her to him, then being sore bestad.<p>

Who soone as he beheld that angels face,<br>
Adorn'd with all diuine perfection,<br>
His cleared heart eftsoones away gan chace<br>
Sad death, reuiued with her sweet inspection<br>
And feeble spirit inly felt refection;<br>
As withered weed through cruell winters tine,<br>
That feeles the warmth of sunny beames reflection,<br>
Liftes vp his head, that did before decline<br>
And gins to spread his leafe before the faire sunshine.<p>

Right so himselfe did <i>Marinell</i> vpreare,<br>
When he in place his dearest loue did spy;<br>
And though his limbs could not his bodie beare,<br>
Ne former strength returne so suddenly,<br>
Yet chearefull signes he shewed outwardly.<br>
Ne lesse was she in secret hart affected,<br>
But that she masked it with modestie,<br>
For feare she should of lightnesse be detected:<br>
Which to another place I leaue to be perfected.<p>
