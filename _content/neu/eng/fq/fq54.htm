<i>Artegall heares of Florimell,<br>
Does with the Pagan fight:<br>
Him slaies, drownes Lady Munera<br>
Does race her castle quight.</i><p>

<blockquote>
N
Ought is more honorable to a knight,<br>
Ne better doth beseeme braue cheualry,<br>
Then to defend the feeble in their right,<br>
And wrong redresse in such as wend awry.<br>
Whilome those great Heroes got thereby<br>
Their greatest glory, for their rightfull deedes,<br>
And place deserued with the Gods on hy.<br>
Herein the noblesse of this knight exceedes,<br>
Who now to perils great for iustice sake proceedes.<p>

To which as he now was vppon the way,<br>
He chaunst to meet a Dwarfe in hasty course;<br>
Whom he requir'd his forward hast to stay,<br>
Till he of tidings mote with him discourse.<br>
Loth was the Dwarfe, yet did he stay perforse,<br>
And gan of sundry newes his store to tell,<br>
As to his memory they had recourse:<br>
But chiefely of the fairest <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
How she was found againe, and spousde to <i>Marinell</i>.<p>

For this was <i>Dony</i>, <i>Florimels</i> owne Dwarfe,<br>
Whom hauing lost (as ye haue heard whyleare)<br>
And finding in the way the scattred scarfe,<br>
The fortune of her life long time did feare.<br>
But of her health when <i>Artegall</i> did heare,<br>
And safe returne, he was full inly glad,<br>
And askt him where, and when her bridale cheare<br>
Should be solemniz'd: for if time he had,<br>
He would be there, and honor to her spousall ad.<p>

Within three daies (quoth hee) as I do here,<br>
It will be at the Castle of the strond;<br>
What time if naught me let, I will be there<br>
To doe her seruice, so as I am bond.<br>
But in my way a little here beyond<br>
A cursed cruell Sarazin doth wonne,<br>
That keepes a Bridges passage by strong hond,<br>
And many errant Knights hath there fordonne;<br>
That makes all men for feare that passage for to shonne.<p>

What mister wight (quoth he) and how far hence<br>
Is he, that doth to trauellers such harmes?<br>
He is (said he) a man of great defence;<br>
Expert in battell and in deedes of armes;<br>
And more emboldned by the wicked charmes,<br>
With which his daughter doth him still support;<br>
Hauing great Lordships got and goodly farmes,<br>
Through strong oppression of his powre extort;<br>
By which he stil them holds, &amp; keepes with strong effort.<p>

And dayly he his wrongs encreaseth more,<br>
For neuer wight he lets to passe that way,<br>
Ouer his Bridge, albee he rich or poore,<br>
But he him makes his passage-penny pay:<br>
Else he doth hold him backe or beat away.<br>
Thereto he hath a groome of euill guize,<br>
Whose scalp is bare, that bondage doth bewray,<br>
Which pols and pils the poore in piteous wize;<br>
But he him selfe vppon th rich doth tyrannize.<p>

His name is hight <i>Pollente</i>, rightly so<br>
For that he is so puissant and strong,<br>
That with his powre he all doth ouergo,<br>
And makes them subiect to his mighty wrong;<br>
And some by sleight he eke doth vnderfong.<br>
For on a Bridge he custometh to fight,<br>
Which is but narrow, but exceeding long;<br>
And in the same are many trap fals pight,<br>
Through which the rider downe doth fall through ouersight.<p>

And vnderneath the same a riuer flowes,<br>
That is both swift and dangerous deepe withall;<br>
Into the which whomso he ouerthrowes,<br>
All destitute of helpe doth headlong fall,<br>
But he him selfe, through practise vsuall,<br>
Leapes forth into the floud, and there assaies<br>
His foe confused through his sodaine fall,<br>
That horse and man he equally dismaies,<br>
And either both them drownes, or trayterously slaies.<p>

Then doth he take the spoile of them at will,<br>
And to his daughter brings, that dwels thereby:<br>
Who all that comes doth take, and therewith fill<br>
The coffers of her wicked threasury;<br>
Which she with wrongs hath heaped vp so hy,<br>
That many Princes she in wealth exceedes,<br>
And purchast all the countrey lying ny<br>
With the reuenue of her plenteous meedes:<br>
Her name is <i>Munera</i>, agreeing with her deedes.<p>

Thereto she is full faire, and rich attired,<br>
With golden hands and siluer feete beside,<br>
That many Lords haue her to wife desired:<br>
But she them all despiseth for great pride.<br>
Now by my life (sayd he) and God to guide,<br>
None other way will I this day betake,<br>
But by that Bridge, whereas he doth abide:<br>
Therefore me thither lead.  No more he spake,<br>
But thitherward forthright his ready way did make.<p>

Vnto the place he came within a while,<br>
Where on the Bridge he ready armed saw<br>
The Sarazin, awayting for some spoile.<br>
Who as they to the passage gan to draw,<br>
A villaine to them came with scull all raw,<br>
That passage money did of them require,<br>
According to the custome of their law.<br>
To whom he aunswerd wroth, Loe there thy hire;<br>
And with that word him strooke, that streight he did expire.<p>

Which when the Pagan saw, he wexed wroth,<br>
And streight him selfe vnto the fight addrest,<br>
Ne was Sir <i>Artegall</i> behinde: so both<br>
Together ran with ready speares in rest.<br>
Right in the midst, whereas they brest to brest<br>
Should meete, a trap was letten downe to fall<br>
Into the floud: streight leapt the Carle vnblest,<br>
Well weening that his foe was falne withall:<br>
But he was well aware, and leapt before his fall.<p>

There being both together in the floud,<br>
They each at other tyrannously flew;<br>
Ne ought the water cooled their whot bloud,<br>
But rather in them kindled choler new.<br>
But there the Paynim, who that vse well knew<br>
To fight in water, great aduantage had,<br>
That oftentimes him nigh he ouerthrew:<br>
And eke the courser, whereuppon he rad,<br>
Could swim like to a fish, whiles he his backe bestrad.<p>

Which oddes when as Sir <i>Artegall</i> espide,<br>
He saw no way, but close with him in hast;<br>
And to him driuing strongly downe the tide,<br>
Vppon his iron coller griped fast,<br>
That with the straint his wesand nigh he brast.<br>
There they together stroue and struggled long,<br>
Either the other from his steede to cast;<br>
Ne euer <i>Artegall</i> his griple strong<br>
For any thing wold slacke, but still vppon him hong.<p>

As when a Dolphin and a Sele are met,<br>
In the wide champian of the Ocean plaine:<br>
With cruell chaufe their courages they whet,<br>
The maysterdome of each by force to gaine,<br>
And dreadfull battaile twixt them do darraine:<br>
They snuf, they snort, they bo&tilde;uce, they rage, they rore,<br>
That all the sea disturbed with their traine,<br>
Doth frie with fome aboue the surges hore.<br>
Such was betwixt these two the troublesome vprore.<p>

So <i>Artegall</i> at length him forst forsake<br>
His horses backe, for dread of being drownd,<br>
And to his handy swimming him betake.<br>
Eftsoones him selfe he from his hold vnbownd,<br>
And then no ods at all in him he fownd:<br>
For <i>Artegall</i> in swimming skilfull was,<br>
And durst the depth of any water sownd.<br>
So ought each Knight, that vse of perill has,<br>
In swimming be expert through waters force to pas.<p>

Then very doubtfull was the warres euent,<br>
Vncertaine whether had the better side:<br>
For both were skild in that experiment,<br>
And both in armes well traind and throughly tride.<br>
But <i>Artegall</i> was better breath'd beside,<br>
And towards th'end, grew greater in his might,<br>
That his faint foe no longer could abide<br>
His puissance, ne beare him selfe vpright,<br>
But from the water to the land betooke his flight.<p>

But <i>Artegall</i> pursewd him still so neare,<br>
With bright Chrysaor in his cruell hand,<br>
That as his head he gan a litle reare<br>
Aboue the brincke, to tread vpon the land,<br>
He smote it off, that tumbling on the strand<br>
It bit the earth for very fell despight,<br>
And gnashed with his teeth, as if he band<br>
High God, whose goodnesse he despaired quight,<br>
Or curst the hand, which did that veng&#7869;ace on him dight.<p>

His corps was carried downe along the Lee,<br>
Whose waters with his filthy bloud it stayned:<br>
But his blasphemous head, that all might see,<br>
He pitcht vpon a pole on high ordayned;<br>
Where many years it afterwards remayned,<br>
To be a mirrour to all mighty men,<br>
In whose right hands great power is contayned,<br>
That none of them the feeble ouerren,<br>
But alwaies doe their powre within iust compasse pen.<p>

That done, vnto the Castle he did wend,<br>
In which the Paynims daughter did abide,<br>
Guarded of many which did her defend:<br>
Of whom he entrance sought, but was denide,<br>
And with reprochfull blasphemy defide,<br>
Beaten with stones downe from the battilment,<br>
That he was forced to withdraw aside;<br>
And bad his seruant <i>Talus</i> to inuent<br>
Which way he enter might, without endangerment.<p>

Eftsoones his Page drew to the Castle gate,<br>
And with his iron flale at it let flie,<br>
That all the warders it did sore amate,<br>
The which erewhile spake so reprochfully,<br>
And made them stoupe, that looked earst so hie.<br>
Yet still he bet, and bounst vppon the dore,<br>
And thundred strokes thereon so hideouslie,<br>
That all the peece he shaked from the flore,<br>
And filled all the house with feare and great vprore.<p>

With noise whereof the Lady forth appeared<br>
Vppon the Castle wall, and when she saw<br>
The daungerous state, in which she stood, she feared<br>
The sad effect of her neare ouerthrow;<br>
And gan entreat that iron man below,<br>
To cease his outrage, and him faire besought,<br>
Sith neither force of stones which they did throw,<br>
Nor powr of charms, which she against him wrought,<br>
Might otherwise preuaile, or make him cease for ought.<p>

But when as yet she saw him to proceede,<br>
Vnmou'd with praiers, or with piteous thought,<br>
She ment him to corrupt with goodly meede;<br>
And causde great sackes with endlesse riches fraught,<br>
Vnto the battilment to be vpbrought,<br>
And powred forth ouer the Castle wall,<br>
That she might win some time, though dearly bought<br>
Whilest he to gathering of the gold did fall.<br>
But he was nothing mou'd, nor tempted therewithall.<p>

But still continu'd his assault the more,<br>
And layd on load with his huge yron flaile,<br>
That at the length he has yrent the dore,<br>
And made way for his maister to assaile.<br>
Who being entred, nought did then auaile<br>
For wight, against his powre them selues to reare:<br>
Each one did flie; their hearts began to faile,<br>
And hid them selues in corners here and there;<br>
And eke their dame halfe dead did hide her self for feare.<p>

Long they her sought, yet no where could they finde her,<br>
That sure they ween'd she was escapt away:<br>
But <i>Talus</i>, that could like a limehound winde her,<br>
And all things secrete wisely could bewray,<br>
At length found out, whereas she hidden lay<br>
Vnder an heape of gold.  Thence he her drew<br>
By the faire lockes, and fowly did array,<br>
Withouten pitty of her goodly hew,<br>
That <i>Artegall</i> him selfe her seemelesse plight did rew.<p>

Yet for no pitty would he change the course<br>
Of Iustice, which in <i>Talus</i> hand did lye;<br>
Who rudely hayld her forth without remorse,<br>
Still holding vp her suppliant hands on hye,<br>
And kneeling at his feete submissiuely.<br>
But he her suppliant hands, those hands of gold,<br>
And eke her feete, those feete of siluer trye,<br>
Which sought vnrighteousnesse, and iustice sold,<br>
Chopt off, and nayld on high, that all might th&#7869; behold.<p>

Her selfe then tooke he by the sclender wast,<br>
In vaine loud crying, and into the flood<br>
Ouer the Castle wall adowne her cast,<br>
And there her drowned in the durty mud:<br>
But the streame washt away her guilty blood.<br>
Thereafter all that mucky pelfe he tooke,<br>
The spoile of peoples euill gotten good,<br>
The which her sire had scrap't by hooke and crooke;<br>
And burning all to ashes, powr'd it downe the brooke.<p>

And lastly all that Castle quite he raced,<br>
Euen from the sole of his foundation,<br>
And all the hewen stones thereof defaced,<br>
That there mote be no hope of reparation,<br>
Nor memory thereof to any nation.<br>
All which when <i>Talus</i> throughly had perfourmed,<br>
Sir <i>Artegall</i> vndid the euill fashion,<br>
And wicked customes of that Bridge refourmed.<br>
Which done, vnto his former iourney he retourned.<p>

In which they measur'd mickle weary way,<br>
Till that at length nigh to the sea they drew;<br>
By which as they did trauell on a day,<br>
They saw before them, far as they could vew,<br>
Full many people gathered in a crew:<br>
Whose great assembly they did much admire,<br>
For neuer there the like resort they knew.<br>
So towardes them they coasted, to enquire<br>
What thing so many nations met, did there desire.<p>

There they beheld a mighty Gyant stand<br>
Vpon a rocke, and holding forth on hie<br>
An huge great paire of ballance in his hand,<br>
With which he boasted in his surquedrie,<br>
That all the world he would weigh equallie,<br>
If ought he had the same to counterpoys.<br>
For want whereof he weighed vanity,<br>
And fild his ballaunce full of idle toys:<br>
Yet was admired much of fooles, women, and boys.<p>

He sayd that he would all the earth vptake,<br>
And all the sea, deuided each from either:<br>
So would he of the fire one ballaunce make,<br>
And one of th'ayre, without or wind, or wether:<br>
Then would he ballaunce heauen and hell together,<br>
And all that did within them all containe;<br>
Of all whose weight, he would not misse a fether.<br>
And looke what surplus did of each remaine,<br>
He would to his owne part restore the same againe.<p>

For why, he sayd they all vnequall were,<br>
And had encroched vppon others share,<br>
Like as the sea (which plaine he shewed there)<br>
Had worne the earth, so did the fire the aire;<br>
So all the rest did others parts empaire.<br>
And so were realmes and nations run awry.<br>
All which he vndertooke for to repaire,<br>
In sort as they were formed aunciently;<br>
And all things would reduce vnto equality.<p>

Therefore the vulgar did about him flocke,<br>
And cluster thicke vnto his leasings vaine,<br>
Like foolish flies about an hony crocke,<br>
In hope by him great benefite to gaine,<br>
And vncontrolled freedome to obtaine.<br>
All which when <i>Artegall</i> did see, and heare,<br>
How he mis-led the simple peoples traine,<br>
In sdeignfull wize he drew vnto him neare,<br>
And thus vnto him spake, without regard or feare;<p>

Thou that presum'st to weigh the world anew,<br>
And all things to an equall to restore,<br>
In stead of right me seemes great wrong dost shew,<br>
And far aboue thy forces pitch to sore.<br>
For ere thou limit what is lesse or more<br>
In euery thing, thou oughtest first to know,<br>
What was the poyse of euery part of yore:<br>
And looke then how much it doth ouerflow,<br>
Or faile thereof, so much is more then iust to trow.<p>

For at the first they all created were<br>
In goodly measure, by their Makers might,<br>
And weighed out in ballaunces so nere,<br>
That not a dram was missing of their right,<br>
The earth was in the middle centre pight,<br>
In which it doth immoueable abide,<br>
Hemd in with waters like a wall in sight;<br>
And they with aire, that not a drop can slide:<br>
Al which the heauens containe, &amp; in their courses guide.<p>

Such heauenly iustice doth among them raine,<br>
That euery one doe know their certaine bound,<br>
In which they doe these many yeares remaine,<br>
And mongst them al no change hath yet beene found.<br>
But if thou now shouldst weigh them new in pound,<br>
We are not sure they would so long remaine:<br>
All change is perillous, and all chaunce vnsound.<br>
Therefore leaue off to weigh them all againe,<br>
Till we may be assur'd they shall their course retaine.<p>

Thou foolishe Elfe (said then the Gyant wroth)<br>
Seest not, how badly all things present bee,<br>
And each estate quite out of order go'th?<br>
The sea it selfe doest thou not plainely see<br>
Encroch vppon the land there vnder thee;<br>
And th'earth it selfe how daily its increast,<br>
By all that dying to it turned be?<br>
Were it not good that wrong were then surceast,<br>
And from the most, that some were giuen to the least?<p>

Therefore I will throw downe these mountaines hie,<br>
And make them leuell with the lowly plaine:<br>
These towring rocks, which reach vnto the skie,<br>
I will thrust downe into the deepest maine,<br>
And as they were, them equalize againe.<br>
Tyrants that make men subiect to their law,<br>
I will suppresse, that they no more may raine;<br>
And Lordings curbe, that commons ouer-aw;<br>
And all the wealth of rich men to the poore will draw.<p>

Of things vnseene how canst thou deeme aright,<br>
Then answered the righteous <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
Sith thou misdeem'st so much of things in sight?<br>
What though the sea with waues continuall<br>
Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all:<br>
Ne is the earth the lesse, or loseth ought,<br>
For whatsoeuer from one place doth fall,<br>
Is with the tide vnto an other brought:<br>
For there is nothing lost, that may be found, if sought.<p>

Likewise the earth is not augmented more,<br>
By all that dying into it doe fade.<br>
For of the earth they formed were of yore;<br>
How euer gay their blossome or their blade<br>
Doe flourish now, they into dust shall vade.<br>
What wrong then is it, if that when they die,<br>
They turne to that, whereof they first were made?<br>
All in the powre of their great Maker lie:<br>
All creatures must obey the voice of the most hie.<p>

They liue, they die, like as he doth ordaine,<br>
Ne euer any asketh reason why.<br>
The hils doe not the lowly dales disdaine;<br>
The dales doe not the lofty hils enuy.<br>
He maketh Kings to sit in souerainty;<br>
He maketh subiects to their powre obay;<br>
He pulleth downe, he setteth vp on hy;<br>
He giues to this, from that he takes away.<br>
For all we haue is his: what he list doe, he may.<p>

What euer thing is done, by him is donne,<br>
Ne any may his mighty will withstand;<br>
Ne any may his soueraine power shonne,<br>
Ne loose that he hath bound with stedfast band.<br>
In vaine therefore doest thou now take in hand,<br>
To call to count, or weigh his workes anew,<br>
Whose counsels depth thou canst not vnderstand,<br>
Sith of things subiect to thy daily vew<br>
Thou doest not know the causes, nor their courses dew.<p>

For take thy ballaunce, if thou be so wise,<br>
And weigh the winde, that vnder heauen doth blow;<br>
Or weigh the light, that in the East doth rise;<br>
Or weigh the thought, that fr&otilde; mans mind doth flow.<br>
But if the weight of these thou canst not show,<br>
Weigh but one word which from thy lips doth fall.<br>
For how canst thou those greater secrets know,<br>
That doest not know the least thing of them all?<br>
Ill can he rule the great, that cannot reach the small.<p>

Therewith the Gyant much abashed sayd;<br>
That he of little things made reckoning light,<br>
Yet the least word that euer could be layd<br>
Within his ballaunce, he could way aright.<br>
Which is (sayd he) more heauy then in weight,<br>
The right or wrong, the false or else the trew?<br>
He answered, that he would try it streight,<br>
So he the words into his ballaunce threw,<br>
But streight the winged words out of his ballaunce flew.<p>

Wroth wext he then, and sayd, that words were light,<br>
Ne would within his ballaunce well abide.<br>
But he could iustly weigh the wrong or right.<br>
Well then, sayd <i>Artegall</i>, let it be tride.<br>
First in one ballance set the true aside.<br>
He did so first; and then the false he layd<br>
In th'other scale; but still it downe did slide,<br>
And by no meane could in the weight be stayd.<br>
For by no meanes the false will with the truth be wayd.<p>

Now take the right likewise, sayd <i>Artegale</i>,<br>
And counterpeise the same with so much wrong.<br>
So first the right he put into one scale;<br>
And then the Gyant stroue with puissance strong<br>
To fill the other scale with so much wrong.<br>
But all the wrongs that he therein could lay,<br>
Might not it peise; yet did he labour long,<br>
And swat, and chauf'd, and proued euery way:<br>
Yet all the wrongs could not a litle right downe lay.<p>

Which when he saw, he greatly grew in rage,<br>
And almost would his balances haue broken:<br>
But <i>Artegall</i> him fairely gan asswage,<br>
And said; Be not vpon thy balance wroken:<br>
For they doe nought but right or wrong betoken;<br>
But in the mind the doome of right must bee;<br>
And so likewise of words, the which be spoken,<br>
The eare must be the ballance, to decree<br>
And iudge, whether with truth or falshood they agree.<p>

But set the truth and set the right aside,<br>
For they with wrong or falshood will not fare;<br>
And put two wrongs together to be tride,<br>
Or else two falses, of each equall share;<br>
And then together doe them both compare.<br>
For truth is one, and right is euer one.<br>
So did he, and then plaine it did appeare,<br>
Whether of them the greater were attone.<br>
But right sate in the middest of the beame alone.<p>

But he the right from thence did thrust away,<br>
For it was not the right, which he did seeke;<br>
But rather stroue extremities to way,<br>
Th'one to diminish, th'other for to eeke.<br>
For of the meane he greatly did misleeke.<br>
Whom when so lewdly minded <i>Talus</i> found,<br>
Approching nigh vnto him cheeke by cheeke,<br>
He shouldered him from off the higher ground,<br>
And down the rock him throwing, in the sea him dround.<p>

Like as a ship, whom cruell tempest driues<br>
Vpon a rocke with horrible dismay,<br>
Her shattered ribs in thousand peeces riues,<br>
And spoyling all her geares and goodly ray,<br>
Does make her selfe misfortunes piteous pray.<br>
So downe the cliffe the wretched Gyant tumbled;<br>
His battred ballances in peeces lay,<br>
His timbered bones all broken rudely rumbled:<br>
So was the high aspyring with huge ruine humbled.<p>

That when the people, which had there about<br>
Long wayted, saw his sudden desolation,<br>
They gan to gather in tumultuous rout,<br>
And mutining, to stirre vp ciuill faction,<br>
For certaine losse of so great expectation.<br>
For well they hoped to haue got great good,<br>
And wondrous riches by his innouation.<br>
Therefore resoluing to reuenge his blood,<br>
They rose in armes, and all in battell order stood.<p>

Which lawlesse multitude him comming too<br>
In warlike wise, when <i>Artegall</i> did vew,<br>
He much was troubled, ne wist what to doo.<br>
For loth he was his noble hands t'embrew<br>
In the base blood of such a rascall crew;<br>
And otherwise, if that he should retire,<br>
He fear'd least they with shame would him pursew.<br>
Therefore he <i>Talus</i> to them sent, t'inquire<br>
The cause of their array, and truce for to desire.<p>

But soone as they him nigh approching spide,<br>
They gan with all their weapons him assay,<br>
And rudely stroke at him on euery side:<br>
Yet nought they could him hurt, ne ought dismay.<br>
But when at them he with his flaile gan lay,<br>
He like a swarme of flyes them ouerthrew;<br>
Ne any of them durst come in his way,<br>
But here and there before his presence flew,<br>
And hid themselues in holes and bushes from his vew.<p>

As when a Faulcon hath with nimble flight<br>
Flowne at a flush of Ducks, foreby the brooke,<br>
The trembling foule dismayd with dreadfull sight<br>
Of death, the which them almost ouertooke,<br>
Doe hide themselues from her astonying looke,<br>
Amongst the flags and couert round about.<br>
When <i>Talus</i> saw they all the field forsooke<br>
And none appear'd of all that raskall rout,<br>
To <i>Artegall</i> he turn'd, and went with him throughout.<p>
