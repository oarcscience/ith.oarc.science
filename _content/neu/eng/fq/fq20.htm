<blockquote> 
<i>Guyon findes Mammon in a delue,<br>
Sunning his threasure hore:<br>
Is by him tempted, &amp; led downe,<br>
To see his secret store.</i><p>
</blockquote> 

 
<p>
<blockquote> 
A
S Pilot well expert in perilous waue,<br>
That to a stedfast starre his course hath bent,<br>
When foggy mistes, or cloudy tempests haue<br>
The faithfull light of that faire lampe yblent,<br>
And couer'd heauen with hideous dreriment,<br>
Vpon his card and compas firmes his eye,<br>
The maisters of his long experiment,<br>
And to them does the steddy helme apply,<br>
Bidding his winged vessell fairely forward fly.<p>
 
So <i>Guyon</i> hauing lost his trusty guide,<br>
Late left beyond that <i>Ydle lake</i>, proceedes<br>
Yet on his way, of none accompanide;<br>
And euermore himselfe with comfort feedes,<br>
Of his owne vertues, and prayse-worthy deedes.<br>
So long he yode, yet no aduenture found,<br>
Which fame of her shrill trompet worthy reedes:<br>
For still he traueild through wide wastfull ground,<br>
That nought but desert wildernesse shew'd all around.<p>
 
At last he came vnto a gloomy glade,<br>
Couer'd with boughes &amp; shrubs from heauens light,<br>
Whereas he sitting found in secret shade<br>
An vncouth, saluage, and vnciuile wight,<br>
Of griesly hew, and fowle ill fauour'd sight;<br>
His face with smoke was tand, and eyes were bleard,<br>
His head and beard with sout were ill bedight,<br>
His cole-blacke hands did seeme to haue beene seard<br>
In smithes fire-spitting forge, and nayles like clawes appeard.<p>
 
His yron coate all ouergrowne with rust,<br>
Was vnderneath enueloped with gold,<br>
Whose glistring glosse darkned with filthy dust,<br>
Well it appeared, to haue beene of old<br>
A worke of rich entayle, and curious mould,<br>
Wouen with antickes and wild Imagery:<br>
And in his lap a masse of coyne he told,<br>
And turned vpsidowne, to feede his eye<br>
A couetous desire with his huge threasury.<p>
 
And round about him lay on euery side<br>
Great heapes of gold, that neuer could be spent:<br>
Of which some were rude owre, not purifide<br>
Of <i>Mulcibers</i> deuouring element;<br>
Some others were new driuen, and distent<br>
Into great Ingoes, and to wedges square;<br>
Some in round plates withouten moniment;<br>
But most were stampt, and in their metall bare<br>
The antique shapes of kings and kesars straunge &amp; rare.<p>
 
Soone as he <i>Guyon</i> saw, in great affright<br>
And hast he rose, for to remoue aside<br>
Those pretious hils from straungers enuious sight,<br>
And downe them poured through an hole full wide,<br>
Into the hollow earth, them there to hide.<br>
But <i>Guyon</i> lightly to him leaping, stayd<br>
His hand, that trembled, as one terrifyde;<br>
And though him selfe were at the sight dismayd,<br>
Yet him perforce restraynd, and to him doubtfull sayd.<p>
 
What art thou man, (if man at all thou art)<br>
That here in desert hast thine habitaunce,<br>
And these rich heapes of wealth doest hide apart<br>
From the worldes eye, and from her right vsaunce?<br>
Thereat with staring eyes fixed askaunce,<br>
In great disdaine, he answerd; Hardy Elfe,<br>
That darest vew my direfull countenaunce,<br>
I read thee rash, and heedlesse of thy selfe,<br>
To trouble my still seate, and heapes of pretious pelfe.<p>
 
God of the world and worldlings I me call,<br>
Great <i>Mammon</i>, greatest god below the skye,<br>
That of my plenty poure out vnto all,<br>
And vnto none my graces do enuye:<br>
Riches, renowme, and principality,<br>
Honour, estate, and all this worldes good,<br>
For which men swinck and sweat incessantly,<br>
Fro me do flow into an ample flood,<br>
And in the hollow earth haue their eternall brood.<p>
 
Wherefore if me thou deigne to serue and sew,<br>
At thy commaund lo all these mountaines bee;<br>
Or if to thy great mind, or greedy vew<br>
All these may not suffise, there shall to thee<br>
Ten times so much be numbred francke and free.<br>
<i>Mammon</i> (said he) thy godheades vaunt is vaine,<br>
And idle offers of thy golden fee;<br>
To them, that couet such eye-glutting gaine,<br>
Proffer thy giftes, and fitter seruaunts entertaine.<p>
 
Me ill besits, that in der-doing armes,<br>
And honours suit my vowed dayes do spend,<br>
Vnto thy bounteous baytes, and pleasing charmes,<br>
With which weake men thou witchest, to attend:<br>
Regard of worldly mucke doth fowly blend,<br>
And low abase the high heroicke spright,<br>
That ioyes for crownes and kingdomes to contend;<br>
Faire shields, gay steedes, bright armes be my delight:<br>
Those be the riches fit for an aduent'rous knight.<p>
 
Vaine glorious Elfe (said he) doest not thou weet,<br>
That money can thy wantes at will supply?<br>
Sheilds, steeds, and armes, &amp; all things for thee meet<br>
It can puruay in twinckling of an eye;<br>
And crownes and kingdomes to thee multiply.<br>
Do not I kings create, and throw the crowne<br>
Sometimes to him, that low in dust doth ly?<br>
And him that raignd, into his rowme thrust downe,<br>
And whom I lust, do heape with glory and renowne?<p>
 
All otherwise (said he) I riches read,<br>
And deeme them roote of all disquietnesse;<br>
First got with guile, and then preseru'd with dread,<br>
And after spent with pride and lauishnesse,<br>
Leauing behind them griefe and heauinesse.<br>
Infinite mischiefes of them do arize,<br>
Strife; and debate, bloudshed, and bitternesse,<br>
Outrageous wrong, and hellish couetize,<br>
That noble heart as great dishonour doth despize.<p>
 
Ne thine be kingdomes, ne the scepters thine;<br>
But realmes and rulers thou doest both confound,<br>
And loyall truth to treason doest incline;<br>
Witnesse the guiltlesse bloud pourd oft on ground,<br>
The crowned often slaine, the slayer cround,<br>
The sacred Diademe in peeces rent,<br>
And purple robe gored with many a wound;<br>
Castles surprizd, great cities sackt and brent:<br>
So mak'st thou kings, &amp; gaynest wrongfull gouernement.<p>
 
Long were to tell the troublous stormes, that tosse<br>
The priuate state, and make the life vnsweet:<br>
Who swelling sayles in Caspian sea doth crosse,<br>
And in frayle wood on <i>Adrian</i> gulfe doth fleet,<br>
Doth not, I weene, so many euils meet.<br>
Then <i>Mammon</i> wexing wroth, And why then, said,<br>
Are mortall men so fond and vndiscreet,<br>
So euill thing to seeke vnto their ayd,<br>
And hauing not complaine, and hauing it vpbraid?<p>
 
Indeede (quoth he) through fowle intemperaunce,<br>
Frayle men are oft captiu'd to couetise:<br>
But would they thinke, with how small allowaunce<br>
Vntroubled Nature doth her selfe suffise,<br>
Such superfluities they would despise,<br>
Which with sad cares empeach our natiue ioyes:<br>
At the well head the purest streames arise:<br>
But mucky filth his braunching armes annoyes,<br>
And with vncomely weedes the gentle waue accloyes.<p>
 
The antique world, in his first flowring youth,<br>
Found no defect in his Creatours grace,<br>
But with glad thankes, and vnreproued truth,<br>
The gifts of soueraigne bountie did embrace:<br>
Like Angels life was then mens happy cace;<br>
But later ages pride, like corn-fed steed,<br>
Abusd her plenty, and fat swolne encreace<br>
To all licentious lust, and gan exceed<br>
The measure of her meane, and naturall first need.<p>
 
Then gan a cursed hand the quiet wombe<br>
Of his great G[r]andmother with steele to wound,<br>
And the hid treasures in her sacred tombe,<br>
With Sacriledge to dig.  Therein he found<br>
Fountaines of gold and siluer to abound,<br>
Of which the matter of his huge desire<br>
And pompous pride eftsoones he did compound;<br>
Then auarice gan through his veines inspire<br>
His greedy flames, and kindled life-deuouring fire.<p>
 
Sonne (said he then) let be thy bitter scorne,<br>
And leaue the rudenesse of that antique age<br>
To them, that liu'd therein in state forlorne;<br>
Thou that doest liue in later times, must wage<br>
Thy workes for wealth, and life for gold engage.<br>
If then thee list my offred grace to vse,<br>
Take what thou please of all this surplusage;<br>
If thee list not, leaue haue thou to refuse:<br>
But thing refused, do not afterward accuse.<p>
 
Me list not (said the Elfin knight) receaue<br>
Thing offred, till I know it well be got,<br>
Ne wote I, but thou didst these goods bereaue<br>
From rightfull owner by vnrighteous lot,<br>
Or that bloud guiltinesse or guile them blot.<br>
Perdy (quoth he) yet neuer eye did vew,<br>
Ne toung did tell, ne hand these handled not,<br>
But safe I haue them kept in secret mew,<br>
From heauens sight, and powre of all which th&#7869; pursew.<p>
 
What secret place (quoth he) can safely hold<br>
So huge a masse, and hide from heauens eye?<br>
Or where hast thou thy wonne, that so much gold<br>
Thou canst preserue from wrong and robbery?<br>
Come thou (quoth he) and see.  So by and by<br>
Through that thicke couert he him led, and found<br>
A darkesome way, which no man could descry,<br>
That deepe descended through the hollow ground,<br>
And was with dread and horrour compassed around.<p>
 
At length they came into a larger space,<br>
That stretcht it selfe into an ample plaine,<br>
Through which a beaten broad high way did trace,<br>
That streight did lead to <i>Plutoes</i> griesly raine:<br>
By that wayes side, there sate infernall Payne,<br>
And fast beside him sat tumultuous Strife:<br>
The one in hand an yron whip did straine,<br>
The other brandished a bloudy knife,<br>
And both did gnash their teeth, &amp; both did threaten life.<p>
 
On thother side in one consort there sate,<br>
Cruell Reuenge, and rancorous Despight,<br>
Disloyall Treason, and hart-burning Hate,<br>
But gnawing Gealosie out of their sight<br>
Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bight,<br>
And trembling Feare still to and fro did fly,<br>
And found no place, where safe he shroud him might,<br>
Lamenting Sorrow did in darknesse lye,<br>
And Shame his vgly face did hide from liuing eye.<p>
 
And ouer them sad Horrour with grim hew,<br>
Did alwayes sore, beating his yron wings;<br>
And after him Owles and Night-rauens flew,<br>
The hatefull messengers of heauy things,<br>
Of death and dolour telling sad tidings;<br>
Whiles sad <i>Celeno</i>, sitting on a clift,<br>
A song of bale and bitter sorrow sings,<br>
That hart of flint a sunder could haue rift:<br>
Which hauing ended, after him she flyeth swift.<p>
 
All these before the gates of <i>Pluto</i> lay,<br>
By whom they passing, spake vnto them nought.<br>
But th'Elfin knight with wonder all the way<br>
Did feed his eyes, and fild his inner thought.<br>
At last him to a litle dore he brought,<br>
That to the gate of Hell, which gaped wide,<br>
Was next adioyning, ne them parted ought:<br>
Betwixt them both was but a litle stride,<br>
That did the house of Richesse from hell-mouth diuide.<p>
 
Before the dore sat selfe-consuming Care,<br>
Day and night keeping wary watch and ward,<br>
For feare least Force or Fraud should vnaware<br>
Breake in, and spoile the treasure there in gard:<br>
Ne would he suffer Sleepe once thither-ward<br>
Approch, albe his drowsie den were next;<br>
For next to death is Sleepe to be compard:<br>
Therefore his house is vnto his annext;<br>
Here Sleep, there Richesse, &amp; Hel-gate th&#7869; both betwext.<p>
 
So soone as <i>Mammon</i> there arriu'd, the dore<br>
To him did open, and affoorded way;<br>
Him followed eke Sir <i>Guyon</i> euermore,<br>
Ne darkenesse him, ne daunger might dismay.<br>
Soone as he entred was, the dore streight way<br>
Did shut, and from behind it forth there lept<br>
An vgly feend, more fowle then dismall day,<br>
The which with monstrous stalke behind him stept,<br>
And euer as he went, dew watch vpon him kept.<p>
 
Well hoped he, ere long that hardy guest,<br>
If euer couetous hand, or lustfull eye,<br>
Or lips he layd on thing, that likt him best,<br>
Or euer sleepe his eye-strings did vntye,<br>
Should be his pray.  And therefore still on hye<br>
He ouer him did hold his cruell clawes,<br>
Threatning with greedy gripe to do him dye<br>
And rend in peeces with his rauenous pawes,<br>
If euer he transgrest the fatall <i>Stygian</i> lawes.<p>
 
That houses forme within was rude and strong,<br>
Like an huge caue, hewne out of rocky clift,<br>
From whose rough vaut the ragged breaches hong,<br>
Embost with massy gold of glorious gift,<br>
And with rich metall loaded euery rift,<br>
That heauy ruine they did seeme to threat;<br>
And ouer them <i>Arachne</i> high did lift<br>
Her cunning web, and spred her subtile net,<br>
Enwrapped in fowle smoke and clouds more blacke then Iet.<p>
 
Both roofe, and floore, and wals were all of gold,<br>
But ouergrowne with dust and old decay,<br>
And hid in darkenesse, that none could behold<br>
The hew thereof: for vew of chearefull day<br>
Did neuer in that house it selfe display,<br>
But a faint shadow of vncertain light;<br>
Such as a lamp, whose life does fade away:<br>
Or as the Moone cloathed with clowdy night,<br>
Does shew to him, that walkes in feare and sad affright.<p>
 
In all that rowme was nothing to be seene,<br>
But huge great yron chests and coffers strong,<br>
All bard with double bends, that none could weene<br>
Them to efforce by violence or wrong;<br>
On euery side they placed were along.<br>
But all the ground with sculs was scattered,<br>
And dead mens bones, which round about were flong,<br>
Whose liues, it seemed, whilome there were shed,<br>
And their vile carcases now left vnburied.<p>
 
They forward passe, ne <i>Guyon</i> yet spoke word,<br>
Till that they came vnto an yron dore,<br>
Which to them opened of his owne accord,<br>
And shewd of richesse such exceeding store,<br>
As eye of man did neuer see before;<br>
Ne euer could within one place be found,<br>
Though all the wealth, which is, or was of yore,<br>
Could gathered be through all the world around,<br>
And that aboue were added to that vnder ground.<p>
 
The charge thereof vnto a couetous Spright<br>
Commaunded was, who thereby did attend,<br>
And warily awaited day and night,<br>
From other couetous feends it to defend,<br>
Who it to rob and ransacke did intend.<br>
Then <i>Mammon</i> turning to that warriour, said;<br>
Loe here the worldes blis, loe here the end,<br>
To which all men do ayme, rich to be made:<br>
Such grace now to be happy, is before thee laid.<p>
 
Certes (said he) I n'ill thine offred grace,<br>
Ne to be made so happy do intend:<br>
Another blis before mine eyes I place,<br>
Another happinesse, another end.<br>
To them, that list, these base regardes I lend:<br>
But I in armes, and in atchieuements braue,<br>
Do rather choose my flitting houres to spend,<br>
And to be Lord of those, that riches haue,<br>
Then them to haue my selfe, and be their seruile sclaue.<p>
 
Thereat the feend his gnashing teeth did grate,<br>
And grieu'd, so long to lacke his greedy pray;<br>
For well he weened, that so glorious bayte<br>
Would tempt his guest, to take thereof assay:<br>
Had he so doen, he had him snatcht away,<br>
More light then Culuer in the Faulcons fist.<br>
Eternall God thee saue from such decay.<br>
But whenas <i>Mammon</i> saw his purpose mist,<br>
Him to entrap vnwares another way he wist.<p>
 
Thence forward he him led, and shortly brought<br>
Vnto another rowme, whose dore forthright,<br>
To him did open, as it had beene taught:<br>
Therein an hundred raunges weren pight,<br>
And hundred fornaces all burning bright;<br>
By euery fornace many feends did bide,<br>
Deformed creatures, horrible in sight,<br>
And euery feend his busie paines applide,<br>
To melt the golden metall, ready to be tride.<p>
 
One with great bellowes gathered filling aire,<br>
And with forst wind the fewell did inflame;<br>
Another did the dying bronds repaire<br>
With yron toungs, and sprinckled oft the same<br>
With liquid waues, fiers <i>Vulcans</i> rage to tame,<br>
Who maistring them, renewd his former heat;<br>
Some scumd the drosse, that from the metall came;<br>
Some stird the molten owre with ladles great;<br>
And euery one did swincke, and euery one did sweat.<p>
 
But when as earthly wight they present saw,<br>
Glistring in armes and battailous aray,<br>
From their whot worke they did themselues withdraw<br>
To wonder at the sight: for till that day,<br>
They neuer creature saw, that came that way.<br>
Their staring eyes sparckling with feruent fire,<br>
And vgly shapes did nigh the man dismay,<br>
That were it not for shame, he would retire,<br>
Till that him thus bespake their soueraigne Lord &amp; sire.<p>
 
Behold, thou Faeries sonne, with mortall eye,<br>
That liuing eye before did neuer see:<br>
The thing, that thou didst craue so earnestly,<br>
To weet, whence all the wealth late shewd by mee,<br>
Proceeded, lo now is reueald to thee.<br>
Here is the fountaine of the worldes good:<br>
Now therefore, if thou wilt enriched bee,<br>
Auise thee well, and chaunge thy wilfull mood,<br>
Least thou perhaps hereafter wish, and be withstood.<p>
 
Suffise it then, thou Money God (quoth hee)<br>
That all thine idle offers I refuse.<br>
All that I need I haue; what needeth mee<br>
To couet more, then I haue cause to vse?<br>
With such vaine shewes thy worldlings vile abuse:<br>
But giue me leaue to follow mine emprise.<br>
<i>Mammon</i> was much displeasd, yet no'te he chuse,<br>
But beare the rigour of his bold mesprise,<br>
And thence him forward led, him further to entise.<p>
 
He brought him through a darksome narrow strait,<br>
To a broad gate, all built of beaten gold:<br>
The gate was open, but therein did wait<br>
A sturdy villein, striding stiffe and bold,<br>
As if that highest God defie he would;<br>
In his right hand an yron club he held,<br>
But he himselfe was all of golden mould,<br>
Yet had both life and sence, and well could weld<br>
That cursed weapon, when his cruell foes he queld.<p>
 
<i>Disdayne</i> he called was, and did disdaine<br>
To be so cald, and who so did him call:<br>
Sterne was his looke, and full of stomacke vaine,<br>
His portaunce terrible, and stature tall,<br>
Far passing th'hight of men terrestriall;<br>
Like an huge Gyant of the <i>Titans</i> race,<br>
That made him scorne all creatures great and small,<br>
And with his pride all others powre deface:<br>
More fit amongst blacke fiendes, then men to haue his place.<p>
 
Soone as those glitterand armes he did espye,<br>
That with their brightnesse made that darknesse light,<br>
His harmefull club he gan to hurtle hye,<br>
And threaten batteill to the Faery knight;<br>
Who likewise gan himselfe to batteill dight,<br>
Till <i>Mammon</i> did his hasty hand withhold,<br>
And counseld him abstaine from perilous fight:<br>
For nothing might abash the villein bold,<br>
Ne mortall steele emperce his miscreated mould.<p>
 
So hauing him with reason pacifide,<br>
And the fiers Carle commaunding to forbeare,<br>
He brought him in.  The rowme was large and wide,<br>
As it some Gyeld or solemne Temple weare:<br>
Many great golden pillours did vpbeare<br>
The massy roofe, and riches huge sustayne,<br>
And euery pillour decked was full deare<br>
With crownes and Diademes, &amp; titles vaine,<br>
Which mortall Princes wore, whiles they on earth did rayne.<p>
 
A route of people there assembled were,<br>
Of euery sort and nation vnder skye,<br>
Which with great vprore preaced to draw nere<br>
To th'vpper part, where was aduaunced hye<br>
A stately siege of soueraigne maiestye;<br>
And thereon sat a woman gorgeous gay,<br>
And richly clad in robes of royaltye,<br>
That neuer earthly Prince in such aray<br>
His glory did enhaunce, and pompous pride display.<p>
 
Her face right wondrous faire did seeme to bee,<br>
That her broad beauties beam great brightnes threw<br>
Through the dim shade, that all men might it see:<br>
Yet was not that same her owne natiue hew,<br>
But wrought by art and counterfetted shew,<br>
Thereby more louers vnto her to call;<br>
Nath'lesse most heauenly faire in deed and vew<br>
She by creation was, till she did fall;<br>
Thenceforth she sought for helps, to cloke her crime withall.<p>
 
There, as in glistring glory she did sit,<br>
She held a great gold chaine ylincked well,<br>
Whose vpper end to highest heauen was knit,<br>
And lower part did reach to lowest Hell;<br>
And all that preace did round about her swell,<br>
To catchen hold of that long chaine, thereby<br>
To clime aloft, and others to excell:<br>
That was <i>Ambition</i>, rash desire to sty,<br>
And euery lincke thereof a step of dignity.<p>
 
Some thought to raise themselues to high degree,<br>
By riches and vnrighteous reward,<br>
Some by close shouldring, some by flatteree;<br>
Others through friends, others for base regard;<br>
And all by wrong wayes for themselues prepard.<br>
Those that were vp themselues, kept others low,<br>
Those that were low themselues, held others hard,<br>
Ne suffred them to rise or greater grow,<br>
But euery one did striue his fellow downe to throw.<p>
 
Which whenas <i>Guyon</i> saw, he gan inquire,<br>
What meant that preace about that Ladies throne,<br>
And what she was that did so high aspire.<br>
Him <i>Mammon</i> answered; That goodly one,<br>
Whom all that folke with such contention,<br>
Do flocke about, my deare my daughter is;<br>
Honour and dignitie from her alone,<br>
Deriued are, and all this worldes blis<br>
For which ye men do striue: few get, but many mis.<p>
 
And faire <i>Philotime</i> she rightly hight,<br>
The fairest wight that wonneth vnder skye,<br>
But that this darksome neather world her light<br>
Doth dim with horrour and deformitie,<br>
Worthy of heauen and hye felicitie,<br>
From whence the gods haue her for enuy thrust:<br>
But sith thou hast found fauour in mine eye,<br>
Thy spouse I will her make, if that thou lust,<br>
That she may thee aduance for workes and merites iust.<p>
 
Gramercy <i>Mammon</i> (said the gentle knight)<br>
For so great grace and offred high estate;<br>
But I, that am fraile flesh and earthly wight,<br>
Vnworthy match for such immortall mate<br>
My selfe well wote, and mine vnequall fate;<br>
And were I not, yet is my trouth yplight,<br>
And loue auowd to other Lady late,<br>
That to remoue the same I haue no might:<br>
To chaunge loue causelesse is reproch to warlike knight.<p>
 
<i>Mammon</i> emmoued was with inward wrath;<br>
Yet forcing it to faine, him forth thence led<br>
Through griesly shadowes by a beaten path,<br>
Into a gardin goodly garnished<br>
With hearbs and fruits, whose kinds mote not be red:<br>
Not such, as earth out of her fruitfull woomb<br>
Throwes forth to men, sweet and well sauoured,<br>
But direfull deadly blacke both leafe and bloom,<br>
Fit to adorne the dead, and decke the drery toombe.<p>
 
There mournfull <i>Cypresse</i> grew in greatest store,<br>
And trees of bitter <i>Gall</i>, and <i>Heben</i> sad,<br>
Dead sleeping <i>Poppy</i>, and blacke <i>Hellebore</i>,<br>
Cold <i>Coloquintida</i>, and <i>Tetra</i> mad,<br>
Mortall <i>Samnitis</i>, and <i>Cicuta</i> bad,<br>
With which th'vniust <i>Atheniens</i> made to dy<br>
Wise <i>Socrates</i>, who thereof quaffing glad<br>
Pourd out his life, and last Philosophy<br>
To the faire <i>Critias</i> his dearest Belamy.<p>
 
The <i>Gardin</i> of <i>Proserpina</i> this hight;<br>
And in the midst thereof a siluer seat,<br>
With a thicke Arber goodly ouer dight,<br>
In which she often vsd from open heat<br>
Her selfe to shroud, and pleasures to entreat.<br>
Next thereunto did grow a goodly tree,<br>
With braunches broad dispred and body great,<br>
Clothed with leaues, that none the wood mote see<br>
And loaden all with fruit as thicke as it might bee.<p>
 
Their fruit were golden apples glistring bright,<br>
That goodly was their glory to behold,<br>
On earth like neuer grew, ne liuing wight<br>
Like euer saw, but they from hence were sold;<br>
For those, which <i>Hercules</i> with conquest bold<br>
Got from great <i>Atlas</i> daughters, hence began,<br>
And planted there, did bring forth fruit of gold:<br>
And those with which th'<i>Eub&aelig;an</i> young man wan<br>
Swift <i>Atalanta</i>, when through craft he her out ran.<p>
 
Here also sprong that goodly golden fruit,<br>
With which <i>Acontius</i> got his louer trew,<br>
Whom he had long time sought with fruitlesse suit:<br>
Here eke that famous golden Apple grew,<br>
The which emongst the gods false <i>Ate</i> threw;<br>
For which th'<i>Id&aelig;an</i> Ladies disagreed,<br>
Till partiall <i>Paris</i> dempt it <i>Venus</i> dew,<br>
And had of her, faire <i>Helen</i> for his meed,<br>
That many noble <i>Greekes</i> and <i>Troians</i> made to bleed.<p>
 
The warlike Elfe much wondred at this tree,<br>
So faire and great, that shadowed all the ground,<br>
And his broad braunches, laden with rich fee,<br>
Did stretch themselues without the vtmost bound<br>
Of this great gardin, compast with a mound,<br>
Which ouer-hanging, they themselues did steepe,<br>
In a blacke flood which flow'd about it round;<br>
That is the riuer of <i>Cocytus</i> deepe,<br>
In which full many soules do endlesse waile and weepe.<p>
 
Which to behold, he clomb vp to the banke,<br>
And looking downe, saw many damned wights,<br>
In those sad waues, which direfull deadly stanke,<br>
Plonged continually of cruell Sprights,<br>
That with their pitteous cryes, and yelling shrights,<br>
They made the further shore resounden wide:<br>
Emongst the rest of those same ruefull sights,<br>
One cursed creature, he by chaunce espide,<br>
That drenched lay full deepe, vnder the Garden side.<p>
 
Deepe was he drenched to the vpmost chin,<br>
Yet gaped still, as coueting to drinke<br>
Of the cold liquor, which he waded in,<br>
And stretching forth his hand, did often thinke<br>
To reach the fruit, which grew vpon the brincke:<br>
But both the fruit from hand, and floud from mouth<br>
Did flie abacke, and made him vainely swinke:<br>
The whiles he steru'd with hunger and with drouth<br>
He daily dyde, yet neuer throughly dyen couth.<p>
 
The knight him seeing labour so in vaine,<br>
Askt who he was, and what he ment thereby:<br>
Who groning deepe, thus answerd him againe;<br>
Most cursed of all creatures vnder skye,<br>
Lo <i>Tantalus</i>, I here tormented lye:<br>
Of whom high <i>Ioue</i> wont whylome feasted bee,<br>
Lo here I now for want of food doe dye:<br>
But if that thou be such, as I thee see,<br>
Of grace I pray thee, giue to eat and drinke to mee.<p>
 
Nay, nay, thou greedie <i>Tantalus</i> (quoth he)<br>
Abide the fortune of thy present fate,<br>
And vnto all that liue in high degree,<br>
Ensample be of mind intemperate,<br>
To teach them how to vse their present state.<br>
Then gan the cursed wretch aloud to cry,<br>
Accusing highest <i>Ioue</i> and gods ingrate,<br>
And eke blaspheming heauen bitterly,<br>
As authour of vniustice, there to let him dye.<p>
 
He lookt a little further, and espyde<br>
Another wretch, whose carkasse deepe was drent<br>
Within the riuer, which the same did hyde:<br>
But both his hands most filthy feculent,<br>
Aboue the water were on high extent,<br>
And faynd to wash themselues incessantly;<br>
Yet nothing cleaner were for such intent,<br>
But rather fowler seemed to the eye;<br>
So lost his labour vaine and idle industry.<p>
 
The knight him calling, asked who he was,<br>
Who lifting vp his head, him answerd thus:<br>
I <i>Pilate</i> am the falsest Iudge, alas,<br>
And most vniust, that by vnrighteous<br>
And wicked doome, to Iewes despiteous<br>
Deliuered vp the Lord of life to die,<br>
And did acquite a murdrer felonous;<br>
The whiles my hands I washt in puritie,<br>
The whiles my soule was soyld with foule iniquitie.<p>
 
Infinite moe, tormented in like paine<br>
He there beheld, too long here to be told:<br>
Ne <i>Mammon</i> would there let him long remaine,<br>
For terrour of the tortures manifold,<br>
In which the damned soules he did behold,<br>
But roughly him bespake.  Thou fearefull foole,<br>
Why takest not of that same fruit of gold,<br>
Ne sittest downe on that same siluer stoole,<br>
To rest thy wearie person, in the shadow coole.<p>
 
All which he did, to doe him deadly fall<br>
In frayle intemperance through sinfull bayt;<br>
To which if he inclined had at all,<br>
That dreadfull feend, which did behind him wayt,<br>
Would him haue rent in thousand peeces strayt:<br>
But he was warie wise in all his way,<br>
And well perceiued his deceiptfull sleight,<br>
Ne suffred lust his safetie to betray;<br>
So goodly did beguile the Guyler of the pray.<p>
 
And now he has so long remained there,<br>
That vitall powres gan wexe both weake and wan,<br>
For want of food, and sleepe, which two vpbeare,<br>
Like mightie pillours, this fraile life of man,<br>
That none without the same enduren can.<br>
For now three dayes of men were full outwrought,<br>
Since he this hardie enterprize began:<br>
For thy great <i>Mammon</i> fairely he besought,<br>
Into the world to guide him backe, as he him brought.<p>
 
The God, though loth, yet was constraind t'obay,<br>
For lenger time, then that, no liuing wight<br>
Below the earth, might suffred be to stay:<br>
So backe againe, him brought to liuing light.<br>
But all so soone as his enfeebled spright<br>
Gan sucke this vitall aire into his brest,<br>
As ouercome with too exceeding might,<br>
The life did flit away out of her nest,<br>
And all his senses were with deadly fit opprest.<p>
