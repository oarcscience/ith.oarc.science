THE

SECOND

BOOKE OF THE  
FAERIE QVEENE.

*Contayning*  
THE LEGEND OF SIR GVYON.  
  
*OR*  
OF TEMPERAUNCE.

> R Ight well I wote most mighty Soueraine,  
> That all this famous antique history,  
> Of some th'aboundance of an idle braine  
> Will iudged be, and painted forgery,  
> Rather then matter of iust memory,  
> Sith none, that breatheth liuing aire, does know,  
> Where is that happy land of Faery,  
> Which I so much do vaunt, yet no where show,  
> But vouch antiquities, which no body can know.
>
> But let that man with better sence aduize,  
> That of the world least part to vs is red:  
> And dayly how through hardy enterprize,  
> Many great Regions are discouered,  
> Which to late age were neuer mentioned.  
> Who euer heard of th'Indian *Peru*?  
> Or who in venturous vessell measured  
> The *Amazon* huge riuer now found trew?  
> Or fruitfullest *Virginia* who did euer vew?
>
> Yet all these were, when no man did them know;  
> Yet haue from wisest ages hidden beene:  
> And later times things more vnknowne shall show.  
> Why then should witlesse man so much misweene  
> That nothing is, but that which he hath seene?  
> What if within the Moones faire shining spheare?  
> What if in euery other starre vnseene  
> Of other worldes he happily should heare?  
> He wõder would much more: yet such to some appeare.
>
> Of Faerie lond yet if he more inquire,  
> By certaine signes here set in sundry place  
> He may it find; ne let him then admire,  
> But yield his sence to be too blunt and bace,  
> That no'te without an hound fine footing trace.  
> And thou, O fairest Princesse vnder sky,  
> In this faire mirrhour maist behold thy face,  
> And thine owne realmes in lond of Faery,  
> And in this antique Image thy great auncestry.
>
> The which O pardon me thus to enfold  
> In couert vele, and wrap in shadowes light,  
> That feeble eyes your glory may behold,  
> Which else could not endure those beames bright,  
> But would be dazled with exceeding light.  
> O pardon, and vouchsafe with patient eare  
> The braue aduentures of this Faery knight  
> The good Sir *Guyon* gratiously to heare,  
> In whom great rule of Temp'raunce goodly doth appeare.
