<blockquote>
<i>Artegall dealeth right betwixt<br>
two brethren that doe strive,<br>
Saues Terpine from the gallow tree,<br>
and doth from death repriue.</i><p>

<blockquote>
VV
Ho so vpon him selfe will take the skill<br>
True Iustice vnto people to diuide,<br>
Had neede haue mightie hands, for to fulfill<br>
That, which he doth with righteous doome decide,<br>
And for to maister wrong and puissant pride,<br>
For vaine it is to deeme of things aright,<br>
And makes wrong doers iustice to deride,<br>
Vnlesse it be perform'd with dreadlesse might.<br>
For powre is the right hand of Iustice truely hight.<p>

Therefore whylome to knights of great emprise<br>
The charge of Iustice giuen was in trust,<br>
That they might execute her iudgements wise,<br>
And with their might beat downe licentious lust,<br>
Which proudly did impugne her sentence iust.<br>
Whereof no brauer president this day<br>
Remaines on earth, preseru'd from yron rust<br>
Of rude obliuion, and long times decay,<br>
Then this of <i>Artegall</i>, which here we haue to say.<p>

Who hauing lately left that louely payre,<br>
Enlincked fast in wedlockes loyall bond,<br>
Bold <i>Marinell</i> with <i>Florimell</i> the fayre,<br>
With whom great feast and goodly glee he fond,<br>
Departed from the Castle of the strond,<br>
To follow his aduentures first intent,<br>
Which long agoe he taken had in hond:<br>
Ne wight with him for his assistance went,<br>
But that great yron groome, his gard and gouernment.<p>

With whom as he did passe by the sea shore,<br>
He chaunst to come, whereas two comely Squires,<br>
Both brethren, whom one wombe together bore,<br>
But stirred vp with different desires,<br>
Together stroue, and kindled wrathfull fires:<br>
And them beside two seemely damzels stood,<br>
By all meanes seeking to asswage their ires,<br>
Now with faire words; but words did little good,<br>
Now with sharpe threats; but threats the more increast their mood.<p>

And there before them stood a Coffer strong,<br>
Fast bound on euery side with iron bands,<br>
But seeming to haue suffred mickle wrong,<br>
Either by being wreckt vppon the sands,<br>
Or being carried farre from forraine lands.<br>
Seem'd that for it these Squires at ods did fall,<br>
And bent against them selues their cruell hands.<br>
But euermore, those Damzels did forestall<br>
Their furious encounter, and their fiercenesse pall.<p>

But firmely fixt they were, with dint of sword,<br>
And battailes doubtfull proofe their rights to try,<br>
Ne other end their fury would afford,<br>
But what to them Fortune would iustify.<br>
So stood they both in readinesse thereby,<br>
To ioyne the combate with cruell intent;<br>
When <i>Artegall</i> arriuing happily,<br>
Did stay a while their greedy bickerment,<br>
Till he had questioned the cause of their dissent.<p>

To whom the elder did this aunswere frame;<br>
Then weete ye Sir, that we two brethren be,<br>
To whom our sire, <i>Milesio</i> by name,<br>
Did equally bequeath his lands in fee,<br>
Two Ilands, which ye there before you see<br>
Not farre in sea; of which the one appeares<br>
But like a little Mount of small degree;<br>
Yet was as great and wide ere many yeares,<br>
As that same other Isle, that greater bredth now beares.<p>

But tract of time, that all things doth decay,<br>
And this deuouring Sea, that naught doth spare,<br>
The most part of my land hath washt away,<br>
And throwne it vp vnto my brothers share:<br>
So his encreased, but mine did empaire.<br>
Before which time I lou'd, as was my lot,<br>
That further mayd, hight <i>Philtera</i> the faire,<br>
With whom a goodly doure I should haue got,<br>
And should haue ioyned bene to her in wedlocks knot.<p>

Then did my younger brother <i>Amidas</i><br>
Loue that same other Damzell, <i>Lucy</i> bright,<br>
To whom but little dowre allotted was;<br>
Her vertue was the dowre, that did delight.<br>
What better dowre can to a dame be hight?<br>
But now when <i>Philtra</i> saw my lands decay,<br>
And former liuelod fayle, she left me quight,<br>
And to my brother did ellope streight way:<br>
Who taking her from me, his owne loue left astray.<p>

She seeing then her selfe forsaken so,<br>
Through dolorous despaire, which she conceyued,<br>
Into the Sea her selfe did headlong throw,<br>
Thinking to haue her griefe by death bereaued.<br>
But see how much her purpose was deceaued.<br>
Whilest thus amidst the billowes beating of her<br>
Twixt life and death, long to and fro she weaued,<br>
She chaunst vnwares to light vppon this coffer,<br>
Which to her in that daunger hope of life did offer.<p>

The wretched mayd that earst desir'd to die,<br>
When as the paine of death she tasted had,<br>
And but halfe seene his vgly visnomie,<br>
Gan to repent, that she had beene so mad,<br>
For any death to chaunge life though most bad:<br>
And catching hold of this Sea-beaten chest,<br>
The lucky Pylot of her passage sad,<br>
After long tossing in the seas distrest,<br>
Her weary barke at last vppon mine Isle did rest.<p>

Where I by chaunce then wandring on the shore,<br>
Did her espy, and through my good endeuour<br>
From dreadfull mouth of death, which threatned sore<br>
Her to haue swallow'd vp, did helpe to saue her.<br>
She then in recompence of that great fauour,<br>
Which I on her bestowed, bestowed on me<br>
The portion of that good, which Fortune gaue her,<br>
Together with her selfe in dowry free;<br>
Both goodly portions, but of both the better she.<p>

Yet in this coffer, which she with her brought,<br>
Great threasure sithence we did finde contained;<br>
Which as our owne we tooke, and so it thought.<br>
But this same other Damzell since hath fained,<br>
That to her selfe that threasure appertained;<br>
And that she did transport the same by sea,<br>
To bring it to her husband new ordained,<br>
But suffred cruell shipwracke by the way.<br>
But whether it be so or no, I can not say.<p>

But whether it indeede be so or no,<br>
This doe I say, that what so good or ill<br>
Or God or Fortune vnto me did throw,<br>
Not wronging any other by my will,<br>
I hold mine owne, and so will hold it still.<br>
And though my land he first did winne away,<br>
And then my loue (though now it little skill,)<br>
Yet my good lucke he shall not likewise pray;<br>
But I will it defend, whilst euer that I may.<p>

So hauing sayd, the younger did ensew;<br>
Full true it is, what so about our land<br>
My brother here declared hath to you:<br>
But not for it this ods twixt vs doth stand,<br>
But for this threasure throwne vppon his strand;<br>
Which well I proue, as shall appeare by triall,<br>
To be this maides, with whom I fastned hand,<br>
Known by good markes, and perfect good espiall,<br>
Therefore it ought be rendred her without deniall.<p>

When they thus ended had, the Knight began;<br>
Certes your strife were easie to accord,<br>
Would ye remit it to some righteous man.<br>
Vnto your selfe, said they, we giue our word,<br>
To bide what iudgement ye shall vs afford.<br>
Then for assuraunce to my doome to stand,<br>
Vnder my foote let each lay downe his sword,<br>
And then you shall my sentence vnderstand.<br>
So each of them layd downe his sword out of his hand.<p>

Then <i>Artegall</i> thus to the younger sayd;<br>
Now tell me <i>Amidas</i>, if that ye may,<br>
Your brothers land the which the sea hath layd<br>
Vnto your part, and pluckt from his away,<br>
By what good right doe you withhold this day?<br>
What other right (quoth he) should you esteeme,<br>
But that the sea it to my share did lay?<br>
Your right is good (sayd he) and so I deeme,<br>
That what the sea vnto you sent, your own should seeme.<p>

Then turning to the elder thus he sayd;<br>
Now <i>Bracidas</i> let this likewise be showne.<br>
Your brothers threasure, which from him is strayd,<br>
Being the dowry of his wife well knowne,<br>
By what right doe you claime to be your owne?<br>
What other right (quoth he) should you esteeme,<br>
But that the sea hath it vnto me throwne?<br>
Your right is good (sayd he) and so I deeme,<br>
That what the sea vnto you sent, your own should seeme.<p>

For equall right in equall things doth stand,<br>
For what the mighty Sea hath once possest,<br>
And plucked quite from all possessors hand,<br>
Whether by rage of waues, that neuer rest,<br>
Or else by wracke, that wretches hath distrest,<br>
He may dispose by his imperiall might,<br>
As thing at randon left, to whom he list.<br>
So <i>Amidas</i>, the land was yours first hight,<br>
And so the threasure yours is <i>Bracidas</i> by right.<p>

When he his sentence thus pronounced had,<br>
Both <i>Amidas</i> and <i>Philtra</i> were displeased:<br>
But <i>Bracidas</i> and <i>Lucy</i> were right glad,<br>
And on the threasure by that iudgement seased.<br>
So was their discord by this doome appeased,<br>
And each one had his right.  Then <i>Artegall</i><br>
When as their sharpe contention he had ceased,<br>
Departed on his way, as did befall,<br>
To follow his old quest, the which him forth did call.<p>

So as he trauelled vppon the way,<br>
He chaunst to come, where happily he spide<br>
A rout of many people farre away;<br>
To whom his course he hastily applide,<br>
To weete the cause of their assemblaunce wide.<br>
To whom when he approched neare in sight,<br>
(An vncouth sight) he plainely then descride<br>
To be a troupe of women warlike dight,<br>
With weapons in their hands, as ready for to fight.<p>

And in the midst of them he saw a Knight,<br>
With both his hands behinde him pinnoed hard,<br>
And round about his necke an halter tight,<br>
As ready for the gallow tree prepard:<br>
His face was couered, and his head was bar'd,<br>
That who he was, vneath was to descry;<br>
And with full heauy heart with them he far'd,<br>
Grieu'd to the soule, and groning inwardly,<br>
That he of womens hands so base a death should dy.<p>

But they like tyrants, mercilesse the more,<br>
Reioyced at his miserable case,<br>
And him reuiled, and reproched sore<br>
With bitter taunts, and termes of vile disgrace.<br>
Now when as <i>Artegall</i> arriu'd in place,<br>
Did aske, what cause brought that man to decay,<br>
They round about him gan to swarme apace,<br>
Meaning on him their cruell hands to lay,<br>
And to haue wrought vnwares some villanous assay.<p>

But he was soone aware of their ill minde,<br>
And drawing backe deceiued their intent;<br>
Yet though him selfe did shame on womankinde<br>
His mighty hand to shend, he <i>Talus</i> sent<br>
To wrecke on them their follies hardyment:<br>
Who with few sowces of his yron flale,<br>
Dispersed all their troupe incontinent,<br>
And sent them home to tell a piteous tale,<br>
Of their vaine prowesse, turned to their proper bale.<p>

But that same wretched man, ordaynd to die,<br>
They left behind them, glad to be so quit:<br>
Him <i>Talus</i> tooke out of perplexitie,<br>
And horrour of fowle death for Knight vnfit,<br>
Who more then losse of life ydreaded it;<br>
And him restoring vnto liuing light,<br>
So brought vnto his Lord, where he did sit,<br>
Beholding all that womanish weake fight;<br>
Whom soone as he beheld, he knew, and thus behight.<p>

Sir <i>Terpine</i>, haplesse man, what make you here?<br>
Or haue you lost your selfe, and your discretion,<br>
That euer in this wretched case ye were?<br>
Or haue ye yeelded you to proude oppression<br>
Of womens powre, that boast of mens subiection?<br>
Or else what other deadly dismall day<br>
Is falne on you, by heauens hard direction,<br>
That ye were runne so fondly far astray,<br>
As for to lead your selfe vnto your owne decay?<p>

Much was the man confounded in his mind,<br>
Partly with shame, and partly with dismay,<br>
That all astonisht he him selfe did find,<br>
And little had for his excuse to say,<br>
But onely thus; Most haplesse well ye may<br>
Me iustly terme, that to this shame am brought,<br>
And made the scorne of Knighthod this same day.<br>
But who can scape, what his owne fate hath wrought?<br>
The worke of heauens will surpasseth humaine thought.<p>

Right true: but faulty men vse oftentimes<br>
To attribute their folly vnto fate,<br>
And lay on heauen the guilt of their owne crimes.<br>
But tell, Sir <i>Terpin</i>, ne let you amate<br>
Your misery, how fell ye in this state.<br>
Then sith ye needs (quoth he) will know my shame,<br>
And all the ill, which chaunst to me of late,<br>
I shortly will to you rehearse the same,<br>
In hope ye will not turne misfortune to my blame<p>

Being desirous (as all Knights are woont)<br>
Through hard aduentures deedes of armes to try,<br>
And after fame and honour for to hunt,<br>
I heard report that farre abrode did fly,<br>
That a proud Amazon did late defy<br>
All the braue Knights, that hold of Maidenhead,<br>
And vnto them wrought all the villany,<br>
That she could forge in her malicious head,<br>
Which some hath put to shame, and many done be dead.<p>

The cause, they say, of this her cruell hate,<br>
Is for the sake of <i>Bellodant</i> the bold,<br>
To whom she bore most feruent loue of late,<br>
And wooed him by all the waies she could:<br>
But when she saw at last, that he ne would<br>
For ought or nought be wonne vnto her will,<br>
She turn'd her loue to hatred manifold,<br>
And for his sake vow'd to doe all the ill<br>
Which she could doe to Knights, which now she doth fulfill.<p>

For all those Knights, the which by force or guile<br>
She doth subdue, she fowly doth entreate.<br>
First she doth them of warlike armes despoile,<br>
And cloth in womens weedes: And then with threat<br>
Doth them compell to worke, to earne their meat,<br>
To spin, to card, to sew, to wash, to wring;<br>
Ne doth she giue them other thing to eat,<br>
But bread and water, or like feeble thing,<br>
Them to disable from reuenge aduenturing.<p>

But if through stout disdaine of manly mind,<br>
Any her proud obseruaunce will withstand,<br>
Vppon that gibbet, which is there behind,<br>
She causeth them be hang'd vp out of hand;<br>
In which condition I right now did stand.<br>
For being ouercome by her in fight,<br>
And put to that base seruice of her band,<br>
I rather chose to die in liues despight,<br>
Then lead that shamefull life, vnworthy of a Knight.<p>

How hight that Amazon (sayd <i>Artegall?</i>)<br>
And where, and how far hence does she abide?<br>
Her name (quoth he) they <i>Radigund</i> doe call,<br>
A Princesse of great powre, and greater pride,<br>
And Queene of Amazons, in armes well tride,<br>
And sundry battels, which she hath atchieued<br>
With great successe, that her hath glorifide,<br>
And made her famous, more then is belieued;<br>
Ne would I it haue ween'd, had I not late it prieued.<p>

Now sure (said he) and by the faith that I<br>
To Maydenhead and noble knighthood owe,<br>
I will not rest, till I her might doe trie,<br>
And venge the shame, that she to Knights doth show.<br>
Therefore Sir <i>Terpin</i> from you lightly throw<br>
This squalid weede, the patterne of dispaire,<br>
And wend with me, that ye may see and know,<br>
How Fortune will your ruin'd name repaire,<br>
And knights of Maidenhead, whose praise she would empaire.<p>

With that, like one that hopelesse was repryu'd<br>
From deathes dore, at which he lately lay,<br>
Those yron fetters, wherewith he was gyu'd,<br>
The badges of reproch, he threw away,<br>
And nimbly did him dight to guide the way<br>
Vnto the dwelling of that Amazone.<br>
Which was from thence not past a mile or tway:<br>
A goodly citty and a mighty one,<br>
The which of her owne name she called <i>Radigone</i>.<p>

Where they arriuing, by the watchmen were<br>
Descried streight; who all the citty warned,<br>
How that three warlike persons did appeare,<br>
Of which the one him seem'd a Knight all armed,<br>
And th'other two well likely to haue harmed.<br>
Eftsoones the people all to harnesse ran,<br>
And like a sort of Bees in clusters swarmed:<br>
Ere long their Queene her selfe, halfe like a man<br>
Came forth into the rout, and them t'array began.<p>

And now the Knights being arriued neare,<br>
Did beat vppon the gates to enter in,<br>
And at the Porter, skorning them so few,<br>
Threw many threats, if they the towne did win,<br>
To teare his flesh in peeces for his sin.<br>
Which when as <i>Radigund</i> there comming heard,<br>
Her heart for rage did grate, and teeth did grin:<br>
She bad that streight the gates should be vnbard,<br>
And to them way to make, with weapons well prepard.<p>

Soone as the gates were open to them set,<br>
They pressed forward, entraunce to haue made.<br>
But in the middle way they were ymet<br>
With a sharpe showre of arrowes, which them staid,<br>
And better bad aduise, ere they assaid<br>
Vnknowen perill of bold womens pride.<br>
Then all that rout vppon them rudely laid,<br>
And heaped strokes so fast on euery side,<br>
And arrowes haild so thicke, that they could not abide.<p>

But <i>Radigund</i> her selfe, when she espide<br>
Sir <i>Terpin</i>, from her direfull doome acquit,<br>
So cruell doale amongst her maides dauide,<br>
T'auenge that shame, they did on him commit;<br>
All sodainely enflam'd with furious fit,<br>
Like a fell Lionesse at him she flew,<br>
And on his head-peece him so fiercely smit,<br>
That to the ground him quite she ouerthrew,<br>
Dismayd so with the stroke, that he no colours knew.<p>

Soone as she saw him on the ground to grouell,<br>
She lightly to him leapt, and in his necke<br>
Her proud foote setting, at his head did leuell,<br>
Weening at once her wrath on him to wreake,<br>
And his contempt, that did her iudg'ment breake.<br>
As when a Beare hath seiz'd her cruell clawes<br>
Vppon the carkasse of some beast too weake,<br>
Proudly stands ouer, and a while doth pause,<br>
To heare the piteous beast pleading her plaintiffe cause.<p>

Whom when as <i>Artegall</i> in that distresse<br>
By chaunce beheld, he left the bloudy slaughter,<br>
In which he swam, and ranne to his redresse.<br>
There her assayling fiercely fresh, he raught her<br>
Such an huge stroke, that it of sence distraught her:<br>
And had she not it warded warily,<br>
It had depriu'd her mother of a daughter.<br>
Nathlesse for all the powre she did apply,<br>
It made her stagger oft, and stare with ghastly eye.<p>

Like to an Eagle in his kingly pride,<br>
Soring through his wide Empire of the aire,<br>
To weather his brode sailes, by chaunce hath spide<br>
A Goshauke, which hath seized for her share<br>
Vppon some fowle, that should her feast prepare;<br>
With dreadfull force he flies at her byliue,<br>
That with his souce, which none enduren dare,<br>
Her from the quarrey he away doth driue,<br>
And from her griping pounce the greedy prey doth riue.<p>

But soone as she her sence recouer'd had,<br>
She fiercely towards him her selfe gan dight,<br>
Through vengeful wrath &amp; sdeignfull pride half mad:<br>
For neuer had she suffred such despight.<br>
But ere she could ioyne hand with him to fight,<br>
Her warlike maides about her flockt so fast,<br>
That they disparted them, maugre their might,<br>
And with their troupes did far a sunder cast:<br>
But mongst the rest the fight did vntill euening last.<p>

And euery while that mighty yron man,<br>
With his strange weapon, neuer wont in warre,<br>
Them sorely vext, and courst, and ouerran,<br>
And broke their bowes, and did their shooting marre,<br>
That none of all the many once did darre<br>
Him to assault, nor once approach him nie,<br>
But like a sort of sheepe dispersed farre<br>
For dread of their deuouring enemie,<br>
Through all the fields and vallies did before him flie.<p>

But when as daies faire shinie-beame, yclowded<br>
With fearefull shadowes of deformed night,<br>
Warn'd man and beast in quiet rest be shrowded,<br>
Bold <i>Radigund</i> with sound of trumpe on hight,<br>
Causd all her people to surcease from fight,<br>
And gathering them vnto her citties gate,<br>
Made them all enter in before her sight,<br>
And all the wounded, and the weake in state,<br>
To be conuayed in, ere she would once retrate.<p>

When thus the field was voided all away,<br>
And all things quieted, the Elfin Knight<br>
Weary of toile and trauell of that day,<br>
Causd his pauilion to be richly pight<br>
Before the city gate, in open sight;<br>
Where he him selfe did rest in safety,<br>
Together with sir <i>Terpin</i> all that night:<br>
But <i>Talus</i> vsde in times of ieopardy<br>
To keepe a nightly watch, for dread of treachery.<p>

But <i>Radigund</i> full of heart-gnawing griefe,<br>
For the rebuke, which she sustain'd that day,<br>
Could take no rest, ne would receiue reliefe,<br>
But tossed in her troublous minde, what way<br>
She mote reuenge that blot, which on her lay.<br>
There she resolu'd her selfe in single fight<br>
To try her Fortune, and his force assay,<br>
Rather then see her people spoiled quight,<br>
As she had seene that day a disauenterous sight.<p>

She called forth to her a trusty mayd,<br>
Whom she thought fittest for that businesse,<br>
Her name was <i>Clarin</i>, and thus to her sayd;<br>
Goe damzell quickly, doe thy selfe addresse,<br>
To doe the message, which I shall expresse.<br>
Goe thou vnto that stranger Faery Knight,<br>
Who yesterday droue vs to such distresse,<br>
Tell, that to morrow I with him will fight,<br>
And try in equall field, whether hath greater might.<p>

But these conditions doe to him propound,<br>
That if I vanquishe him, he shall obay<br>
My law, and euer to my lore be bound;<br>
And so will I, if me he vanquish may,<br>
What euer he shall like to doe or say.<br>
Goe streight, and take with thee, to witnesse it,<br>
Sixe of thy fellowes of the best array,<br>
And beare with you both wine and iuncates fit,<br>
And bid him eate, henceforth he oft shall hungry sit.<p>

The Damzell streight obayd, and putting all<br>
In readinesse, forth to the Towne-gate went;<br>
Where sounding loud a Trumpet from the wall,<br>
Vnto those warlike Knights she warning sent.<br>
Then <i>Talus</i> forth issuing from the tent,<br>
Vnto the wall his way did fearelesse take,<br>
To weeten what that trumpets sounding ment:<br>
Where that same Damzell lowdly him bespake,<br>
And shew'd, that with his Lord she would emparlaunce make.<p>

So he them streight conducted to his Lord,<br>
Who, as he could, them goodly well did greete,<br>
Till they had told their message word by word:<br>
Which he accepting well, as he could weete,<br>
Them fairely entertaynd with curt'sies meete,<br>
And gaue them gifts and things of deare delight.<br>
So backe againe they homeward turnd their feete.<br>
But <i>Artegall</i> him selfe to rest did dight,<br>
That he mote fresher be against the next daies fight.<p>
