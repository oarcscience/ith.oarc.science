<p>
<blockquote> 
 
<i>Forsaken Truth long seekes her loue,<br>
And makes the Lyon mylde,<br>
Marres blind Deuotions mart, and fals<br> 
In hand of leachour vylde.</i><p>
</blockquote> 
<p>
<blockquote> 
NOught there vnder heau'ns wilde hollownesse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
That moues more deare compassion of mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then beautie brought t'vnworthy wretchednesse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through enuies snares or fortunes freakes vnkind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
I, whether lately through her brightnesse blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or through alleageance and fast fealtie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which I do owe vnto all woman kind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Feele my heart perst with so great agonie,<br>
When such I see, that all for pittie I could die.<p>
 
And now it is empassioned so deepe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
For fairest <i>Vnaes</i> sake, of whom I sing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That my fraile eyes these lines with teares do steepe,<br>
To thinke how she through guilefull handeling,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though true as touch, though daughter of a king,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though faire as euer liuing wight was faire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though nor in word nor deede ill meriting,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is from her knight diuorced in despaire<br>
And her due loues deriu'd to that vile witches share.<p>
 
Yet she most faithfull Ladie all this while<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forsaken, wofull, solitarie mayd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Farre from all peoples prease, as in exile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To seeke her knight; who subtilly betrayd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through that late vision, which th'Enchaunter wrought,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Had her abandond. She of nought affrayd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through woods and wastnesse wide him daily sought;<br>
Yet wished tydings none of him vnto her brought.<p>
 
One day nigh wearie of the yrkesome way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From her vnhastie beast she did alight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And on the grasse her daintie limbes did lay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In secret shadow, farre from all mens sight:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From her faire head her fillet she vndight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And laid her stole aside. Her angels face<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As the great eye of heauen shyned bright,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And made a sunshine in the shadie place;<br>
Did neuer mortall eye behold such heauenly grace.<p>
 
It fortuned out of the thickest wood<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A ramping Lyon rushed suddainly,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hunting full greedie after saluage blood;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soone as the royall virgin he did spy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With gaping mouth at her ran greedily,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To haue attonce deuour'd her tender corse:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But to the pray when as he drew more ny,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His bloudie rage asswaged with remorse,<br>
And with the sight amazd, forgat his furious forse.<p>
 
In stead thereof he kist her wearie feet,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And lickt her lilly hands with fawning tong,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As he her wronged innocence did weet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
O how can beautie maister the most strong,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And simple truth subdue auenging wrong?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose yeelded pride and proud submission,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still dreading death, when she had marked long,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her hart gan melt in great compassion,<br>
And drizling teares did shed for pure affection.<p>
 
The Lyon Lord of euerie beast in field,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Quoth she, his princely puissance doth abate,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And mightie proud to humble weake does yield,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forgetfull of the hungry rage, which late<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Him prickt, in pittie of my sad estate:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But he my Lyon, and my noble Lord,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
How does he find in cruell hart to hate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her that him lou'd, and euer most adord,<br>
As the God of my life?  why hath he me abhord?<p>
 
Redounding teares did choke th'end of her plaint,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which softly ecchoed from the neighbour wood;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sad to see her sorrowfull constraint<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The kingly beast vpon her gazing stood;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With pittie calmd, downe fell his angry mood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
At last in close hart shutting vp her paine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Arose the virgin borne of heauenly brood,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And to her snowy Palfrey got againe,<br>
To seeke her strayed Champion, if she might attaine.<p>
 
The Lyon would not leaue her desolate,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But with her went along, as a strong gard<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of her chast person, and a faithfull mate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still when she slept, he kept both watch and ward,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And when she wakt, he waited diligent,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With humble seruice to her will prepard:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From her faire eyes he tooke commaundement,<br>
And euer by her lookes conceiued her intent.<p>
 
Long she thus traueiled through deserts wyde,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By which she thought her wandring knight shold pas,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet neuer shew of liuing wight espyde;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Till that at length she found the troden gras,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In which the tract of peoples footing was,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnder the steepe foot of a mountaine hore;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The same she followes, till at last she has<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A damzell spyde slow footing her before,<br>
That on her shoulders sad a pot of water bore.<p>
 
To whom approching she to her gan call,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To weet, if dwelling place were nigh at hand;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the rude wench her answer'd nought at all,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She could not heare, nor speake, nor vnderstand;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Till seeing by her side the Lyon stand,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With suddaine feare her pitcher downe she threw,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And fled away: for neuer in that land<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Face of faire Ladie she before did vew,<br>
And that dread Lyons looke her cast in deadly hew.<p>
 
Full fast she fled, ne euer lookt behynd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As if her life vpon the wager lay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And home she came, whereas her mother blynd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sate in eternall night: nought could she say,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But suddaine catching hold, did her dismay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With quaking hands, and other signs of feare:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who full of ghastly fright and cold affray,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gan shut the dore. By this arriued there<br>
Dame <i>Vna</i>, wearie Dame, and entrance did requere.<p>
 
Which when none yeelded, her vnruly Page<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With his rude clawes the wicket open rent,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And let her in; where of his cruell rage<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nigh dead with feare, and faint astonishment,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She found them both in darkesome corner pent;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where that old woman day and night did pray<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon her beades deuoutly penitent;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nine hundred <i>Pater nosters</i> euery day,<br>
And thrise nine hundred <i>Aues</i> she was wont to say.<p>
 
And to augment her painefull pennance more,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thrise euery weeke in ashes she did sit,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And next her wrinkled skin rough sackcloth wore,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And thrise three times did fast from any bit:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But now for feare her beads she did forget.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose needlesse dread for to remoue away,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Faire <i>Vna</i> framed words and count'nance fit:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which hardly doen, at length she gan them pray,<br>
That in their cotage small, that night she rest her may.<p>
 
The day is spent, and commeth drowsie night,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
When euery creature shrowded is in sleepe;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sad <i>Vna</i> downe her laies in wearie plight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And at her feet the Lyon watch doth keepe:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In stead of rest, she does lament, and weepe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the late losse of her deare loued knight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sighes, and grones, and euermore does steepe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her tender brest in bitter teares all night,<br>
All night she thinks too long, and often lookes for light.<p>
 
Now when <i>Aldeboran</i> was mounted hie<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Aboue the shynie <i>Cassiopeias</i> chaire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all in deadly sleepe did drowned lie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
One knocked at the dore, and in would fare;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He knocked fast, and often curst, and sware,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That readie entrance was not at his call:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For on his backe a heauy load he bare<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of nightly stelths and pillage seuerall,<br>
Which he had got abroad by purchase criminall.<p>
 
He was to weete a stout and sturdie thiefe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wont to robbe Churches of their ornaments,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And poore mens boxes of their due reliefe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which giuen was to them for good intents;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The holy Saints of their rich vestiments<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He did disrobe, when all men carelesse slept,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And spoild the Priests of their habiliments,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whiles none the holy things in safety kept;<br>
Then he by cunning sleights in at the window crept.<p>
 
And all that he by right or wrong could find,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnto this house he brought, and did bestow<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon the daughter of this woman blind,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Abessa</i> daughter of <i>Corceca</i> slow,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With whom he whoredome vsd, that few did know,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And fed her fat with feast of offerings,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And plentie, which in all the land did grow;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne spared he to giue her gold and rings:<br>
And now he to her brought part of his stolen things.<p>
 
Thus long the dore with rage and threats he bet,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet of those fearefull women none durst rize,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Lyon frayed them, him in to let:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He would no longer stay him to aduize,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But open breakes the dore in furious wize,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And entring is; when that disdainfull beast<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Encountring fierce, him suddaine doth surprize,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And seizing cruell clawes on trembling brest,<br>
Vnder his Lordly foot him proudly hath supprest.<p>
 
Him booteth not resist, nor succour call,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His bleeding hart is in the vengers hand,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who streight him rent in thousand peeces small,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And quite dismembred hath: the thirstie land<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Drunke vp his life; his corse left on the strand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His fearefull friends weare out the wofull night,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne dare to weepe, nor seeme to vnderstand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The heauie hap, which on them is alight,<br>
Affraid, least to themselues the like mishappen might.<p>
 
Now when broad day the world discouered has,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vp <i>Vna</i> rose, vp rose the Lyon eke,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And on their former iourney forward pas,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In wayes vnknowne, her wandring knight to seeke,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With paines farre passing that long wandring 
<i>Greeke</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That for his loue refused deitie;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such were the labours of this Lady meeke,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still seeking him, that from her still did flie,<br>
Then furthest from her hope, when most she weened nie.<p>
 
Soone as she parted thence, the fearefull twaine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That blind old woman and her daughter deare<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Came forth, and finding <i>Kirkrapine</i> there slaine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For anguish great they gan to rend their heare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And beat their brests, and naked flesh to teare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And when they both had wept and wayld their fill,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then forth they ranne like two amazed deare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Halfe mad through malice, and reuenging will,<br>
To follow her, that was the causer of their ill.<p>
 
Whom ouertaking, they gan loudly bray,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With hollow howling, and lamenting cry,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shamefully at her rayling all the way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And her accusing of dishonesty,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That was the flowre of faith and chastity;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And still amidst her rayling, she did pray,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That plagues, and mischiefs, and long misery<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Might fall on her, and follow all the way,<br>
And that in endlesse error she might euer stray.<p>
 
But when she saw her prayers nought preuaile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She backe returned with some labour lost;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in the way as she did weepe and waile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A knight her met in mighty armes embost,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet knight was not for all his bragging bost,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But subtill <i>Archimag</i>, that <i>Vna</i> sought<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By traynes into new troubles to haue tost:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of that old woman tydings he besought,<br>
If that of such a Ladie she could tellen ought.<p>
 
Therewith she gan her passion to renew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And cry, and curse, and raile, and rend her heare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Saying, that harlot she too lately knew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That causd her shed so many a bitter teare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And so forth told the story of her feare:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Much seemed he to mone her haplesse chaunce,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And after for that Ladie did inquere;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which being taught, he forward gan aduaunce<br>
His fair enchaunted steed, and eke his charmed launce.<p>
 
Ere long he came, where <i>Vna</i> traueild slow,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And that wilde Champion wayting her besyde:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whom seeing such, for dread he durst not show<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Himselfe too nigh at hand, but turned wyde<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnto an hill; from whence when she him spyde,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By his like seeming shield, her knight by name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She weend it was, and towards him gan ryde:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Approching nigh, she wist it was the same,<br>
And with faire fearefull humblesse towards him shee came.<p>
 
And weeping said, Ah my long lacked Lord,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where haue ye bene thus long out of my sight?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Much feared I to haue bene quite abhord,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or ought haue done, that ye displeasen might,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That should as death vnto my deare hart light:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For since mine eye your ioyous sight did mis,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
My chearefull day is turnd to chearelesse night,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And eke my night of death the shadow is;<br>
But welcome now my light, and shining lampe of blis.<p>
 
He thereto meeting said, My dearest Dame,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Farre be it from your thought, and fro my will,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To thinke that knighthood I so much should shame,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As you to leaue, that haue me loued still,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And chose in Faery court of meere goodwill,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where noblest knights were to be found on earth:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The earth shall sooner leaue her kindly skill<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To bring forth fruit, and make eternall derth,<br>
Then I leaue you, my liefe, yborne of heauenly berth.<p>
 
And sooth to say, why I left you so long,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was for to seeke aduenture in strange place,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where <i>Archimago</i> said a felon strong<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To many knights did daily worke disgrace;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But knight he now shall neuer more deface:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good cause of mine excuse; that mote ye please<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well to accept, and euermore embrace<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
My faithfull seruice, that by land and seas<br>
Haue vowd you to defend. Now then your plaint appease.<p>
 
His louely words her seemd due recompence<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of all her passed paines: one louing howre<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For many yeares of sorrow can dispence:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A dram of sweet is worth a pound of sowre:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She has forgot, how many a wofull stowre<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For him she late endur'd; she speakes no more<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of past: true is, that true loue hath no powre<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To looken backe; his eyes be fixt before.<br>
Before her stands her knight, for whom she toyld so sore.<p>
 
Much like, as when the beaten marinere,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That long hath wandred in the <i>Ocean</i> wide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oft soust in swelling <i>Tethys</i> saltish teare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And long time hauing tand his tawney hide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With blustring breath of heauen, that none can bide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And scorching flames of fierce <i>Orions</i> hound,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Soone as the port from farre he has espide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His chearefull whistle merrily doth sound,<br>
And <i>Nereus</i> crownes with cups; his mates him pledg around.<p>
 
Such ioy made <i>Vna</i>, when her knight she found;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And eke th'enchaunter ioyous seemd no lesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then the glad marchant, that does vew from ground<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His ship farre come from watrie wildernesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He hurles out vowes, and <i>Neptune</i> oft doth blesse:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So forth they past, and all the way they spent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Discoursing of her dreadfull late distresse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In which he askt her, what the Lyon ment:<br>
Who told her all that fell in iourney as she went.<p>
 
They had not ridden farre, when they might see<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
One pricking towards them with hastie heat,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Full strongly armd, and on a courser free,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That through his fiercenesse fomed all with sweat,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the sharpe yron did for anger eat,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
When his hot ryder spurd his chauffed side;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His looke was sterne, and seemed still to threat<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cruell reuenge, which he in hart did hyde,<br>
And on his shield <i>Sans loy</i> in bloudie lines was dyde.<p>
 
When nigh he drew vnto this gentle payre<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And saw the Red-crosse, which the knight did beare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He burnt in fire, and gan eftsoones prepare<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Himselfe to battell with his couched speare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Loth was that other, and did faint through feare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To taste th'vntryed dint of deadly steele;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But yet his Lady did so well him cheare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That hope of new good hap he gan to feele;<br>
So bent his speare, and spurnd his horse with yron heele.<p>
 
But that proud Paynim forward came so fierce,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And full of wrath, that with his sharp-head speare<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through vainely crossed shield he quite did pierce,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And had his staggering steede not shrunke for feare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through shield and bodie eke he should him beare:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet so great was the puissance of his push,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That from his saddle quite he did him beare:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He tombling rudely downe to ground did rush,<br>
And from his gored wound a well of bloud did gush.<p>
 
Dismounting lightly from his loftie steed,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He to him lept, in mind to reaue his life,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And proudly said, Lo there the worthie meed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of him, that slew <i>Sansfoy</i> with bloudie knife;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In peace may passen ouer <i>Lethe</i> lake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
When morning altars purgd with enemies life,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The blacke infernall <i>Furies</i> doen aslake:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Life from <i>Sansfoy</i> thou tookst, <i>Sansloy</i> shall fr&otilde; 
thee 
take.<p>
 
Therewith in haste his helmet gan vnlace,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Till <i>Vna</i> cride, O hold that heauie hand,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Deare Sir, what euer that thou be in place:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Enough is, that thy foe doth vanquisht stand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now at thy mercy: Mercie not withstand:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For he is one the truest knight aliue,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though conquered now he lie on lowly land,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And whilest him fortune fauourd, faire did thriue<br>
In bloudie field: therefore of life him not depriue.<p>
 
Her piteous words might not abate his rage,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But rudely rending vp his helmet, would<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Haue slaine him straight: but when he sees his age,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And hoarie head of <i>Archimago</i> old,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His hastie hand he doth amazed hold,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And halfe ashamed, wondred at the sight:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the old man well knew he, though vntold,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In charmes and magicke to haue wondrous might,<br>
Ne euer wont in field, ne in round lists to fight.<p>
 
And said, Why <i>Archimago</i>, lucklesse syre,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
What doe I see? what hard mishap is this,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That hath thee hither brought to taste mine yre?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or thine the fault, or mine the error is,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In stead of foe to wound my friend amis?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He answered nought, but in a traunce still lay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And on those guilefull dazed eyes of his<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The cloud of death did sit. Which doen away,<br>
He left him lying so, ne would no lenger stay.<p>
 
But to the virgin comes, who all this while<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Amased stands, her selfe so mockt to see<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By him, who has the guerdon of his guile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For so misfeigning her true knight to bee:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet is she now in more perplexitie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Left in the hand of that same Paynim bold,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From whom her booteth not at all to flie;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who by her cleanly garment catching hold,<br>
Her from her Palfrey pluckt, her visage to behold.<p>
 
But her fierce seruant full of kingly awe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And high disdaine, whenas his soueraine Dame<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So rudely handled by her foe he sawe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With gaping iawes full greedy at him came,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And ramping on his shield, did weene the same<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Haue reft away with his sharpe rending clawes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But he was stout, and lust did now inflame<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His corage more, that fr&otilde; his griping pawes<br>
He hath his shield redeem'd, and foorth his sword he drawes.<p>
 
O then too weake and feeble was the forse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of saluage beast, his puissance to withstand:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For he was strong, and of so mightie corse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As euer wielded speare in warlike hand,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And feates of armes did wisely vnderstand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Eftsoones he perced through his chaufed chest<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With thrilling point of deadly yron brand,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And launcht his Lordly hart: with death opprest<br>
He roar'd aloud, whiles life forsooke his stubborne brest.<p>
 
Who now is left to keepe the forlorne maid<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From raging spoile of lawlesse victors will?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her faithfull gard remou'd, her hope dismaid,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her selfe a yeelded pray to saue or spill.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He now Lord of the field, his pride to fill,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With foule reproches, and disdainfull spight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her vildly entertaines, and will or nill,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beares her away vpon his courser light:<br>
Her prayers nought preuaile, his rage is more of might.<p>
 
And all the way, with great lamenting paine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And piteous plaints she filleth his dull eares,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That stony hart could riuen haue in twaine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all the way she wets with flowing teares:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But he enrag'd with rancor, nothing heares.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her seruile beast yet would not leaue her so,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But followes her farre off, ne ought he feares,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To be partaker of her wandring woe,<br>
More mild in beastly kind, then that her beastly foe.<p>
