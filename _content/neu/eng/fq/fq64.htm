<p> 
<blockquote>
<i>Artegall doth Sir Burbon aide,<br>
And blames for changing shield:<br>
He with the great Grantorto fights,<br>
And slaieth him in field.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
O
 Sacred hunger of ambitious mindes,<br>
And impotent desire of men to raine,<br>
Whom neither dread of God, that deuils bindes,<br>
Nor lawes of men, that common weales containe,<br>
Nor bands of nature, that wilde beastes restraine,<br>
Can keepe from outrage, and from doing wrong,<br>
Where they may hope a kingdome to obtaine.<br>
No faith so firme, no trust can be so strong,<br>
No loue so lasting then, that may enduren long.<p>

Witnesse may <i>Burbon</i> be, whom all the bands,<br>
Which may a Knight assure, had surely bound,<br>
Vntill the loue of Lordship and of lands<br>
Made him become most faithlesse and vnsound:<br>
And witnesse be <i>Gerioneo</i> found,<br>
Who for like cause faire <i>Belge</i> did oppresse,<br>
And right and wrong most cruelly confound:<br>
And so be now <i>Grantorto</i>, who no lesse<br>
Then all the rest burst out to all outragiousnesse.<p>

Gainst whom Sir <i>Artegall</i>, long hauing since<br>
Taken in hand th'exploit, being theretoo<br>
Appointed by that mightie Faerie Prince,<br>
Great <i>Gloriane</i>, that Tyrant to fordoo,<br>
Through other great aduentures hethertoo<br>
Had it forslackt.  But now time drawing ny,<br>
To him assynd, her high beheast to doo,<br>
To the sea shore he gan his way apply,<br>
To weete if shipping readie he mote there descry.<p>

Tho when they came to the sea coast, they found<br>
A ship all readie (as good fortune fell)<br>
To put to sea, with whom they did compound,<br>
To passe them ouer, where them list to tell:<br>
The winde and weather serued them so well,<br>
That in one day they with the coast did fall;<br>
Whereas they readie found them to repell,<br>
Great hostes of men in order martiall,<br>
Which them forbad to land, and footing did forstall.<p>

But nathemore would they from land refraine,<br>
But when as nigh vnto the shore they drew,<br>
That foot of man might sound the bottome plaine,<br>
<i>Talus</i> into the sea did forth issew,<br>
Though darts from shore and stones they at him threw;<br>
And wading through the waues with stedfast sway,<br>
Maugre the might of all those troupes in vew,<br>
Did win the shore, whence he them chast away,<br>
And made to fly, like doues, whom the Eagle doth affray.<p>

The whyles Sir <i>Artegall</i>, with that old knight<br>
Did forth descend, there being none them neare,<br>
And forward marched to a towne in sight.<br>
By this came tydings to the Tyrants eare,<br>
By those, which earst did fly away for feare<br>
Of their arriuall: wherewith troubled sore,<br>
He all his forces streight to him did reare,<br>
And forth issuing with his scouts afore,<br>
Meant them to haue incountred, ere they left the shore.<p>

But ere he marched farre, he with them met,<br>
And fiercely charged them with all his force;<br>
But <i>Talus</i> sternely did vpon them set,<br>
And brusht, and battred them without remorse,<br>
That on the ground he left full many a corse;<br>
Ne any able was him to withstand,<br>
But he them ouerthrew both man and horse,<br>
That they lay scattred ouer all the land,<br>
As thicke as doth the seede after the sowers hand;<p>

Till <i>Artegall</i> him seeing so to rage,<br>
Willd him to stay, and signe of truce did make:<br>
To which all harkning, did a while asswage<br>
Their forces furie, and their terror slake;<br>
Till he an Herauld cald, and to him spake,<br>
Willing him wend vnto the Tyrant streight,<br>
And tell him that not for such slaughters sake<br>
He thether came, but for to trie the right<br>
Of fayre <i>Irenaes</i> cause with him in single fight.<p>

And willed him for to reclayme with speed<br>
His scattred people, ere they all were slaine,<br>
And time and place conuenient to areed,<br>
In which they two the combat might darraine.<br>
Which message when <i>Grantorto</i> heard, full fayne<br>
And glad he was the slaughter so to stay,<br>
And pointed for the combat twixt them twayne<br>
The morrow next, ne gaue him longer day;<br>
So sounded the retraite, and drew his folke away.<p>

That night Sir <i>Artegall</i> did cause his tent<br>
There to be pitched on the open plaine;<br>
For he had giuen streight commaundement,<br>
That none should dare him once to entertaine:<br>
Which none durst breake, though many would right faine<br>
For fayre <i>Irena</i>, whom they loued deare.<br>
But yet old <i>Sergis</i> did so well him paine,<br>
That from close friends, that dar'd not to appeare,<br>
He all things did puruay, which for them needfull weare.<p>

The morrow next, that was the dismall day,<br>
Appointed for <i>Irenas</i> death before,<br>
So soone as it did to the world display<br>
His chearefull face, and light to men restore,<br>
The heauy Mayd, to whom none tydings bore<br>
Of <i>Artegals</i> arryuall, her to free,<br>
Lookt vp with eyes full sad and hart full sore;<br>
Weening her lifes last howre then neare to bee,<br>
Sith no redemption nigh she did nor heare nor see.<p>

Then vp she rose, and on her selfe did dight<br>
Most squalid garments, fit for such a day,<br>
And with dull countenance, and with doleful spright,<br>
She forth was brought in sorrowfull dismay,<br>
For to receiue the doome of her decay.<br>
But comming to the place, and finding there<br>
Sir <i>Artegall</i>, in battailous array<br>
Wayting his foe, it did her dead hart cheare,<br>
And new life to her lent, in midst of deadly feare.<p>

Like as a tender Rose in open plaine,<br>
That with vntimely drought nigh withered was,<br>
And hung the head, soone as few drops of raine<br>
Thereon distill, and deaw her daintie face,<br>
Gins to looke vp, and with fresh wonted grace<br>
Dispreds the glorie of her leaues gay;<br>
Such was <i>Irenas</i> countenance, such her case,<br>
When <i>Artegall</i> she saw in that array,<br>
There wayting for the Tyrant, till it was farre day.<p>

Who came at length, with proud presumpteous gate,<br>
Into the field, as if he fearelesse were,<br>
All armed in a cote of yron plate,<br>
Of great defence to ward the deadly feare,<br>
And on his head a steele cap he did weare<br>
Of colour rustie browne, but sure and strong;<br>
And in his hand an huge Polaxe did beare,<br>
Whose steale was yron studded, but not long,<br>
With which he wont to fight, to iustifie his wrong.<p>

Of stature huge and hideous he was,<br>
Like to a Giant for his monstrous hight,<br>
And did in strength most sorts of men surpas,<br>
Ne euer any found his match in might;<br>
Thereto he had great skill in single fight:<br>
His face was vgly, and his countenance sterne,<br>
That could haue frayd one with the very sight,<br>
And gaped like a gulfe, when he did gerne,<br>
That whether man or monster one could scarse discerne.<p>

Soone as he did within the listes appeare,<br>
With dreadfull looke he <i>Artegall</i> beheld,<br>
As if he would haue daunted him with feare,<br>
And grinning griesly, did against him weld<br>
His deadly weapon, which in hand he held.<br>
But th'Elfin swayne, that oft had seene like sight,<br>
Was with his ghastly count'nance nothing queld,<br>
But gan him streight to buckle to the fight,<br>
And cast his shield about, to be in readie plight.<p>

The trompets sound, and they together goe,<br>
With dreadfull terror, and with fell intent;<br>
And their huge strokes full daungerously bestow,<br>
To doe most dammage, where as most they ment.<br>
But with such force and furie violent,<br>
The tyrant thundred his thicke blowes so fast,<br>
That through the yron walles their way they rent,<br>
And euen to the vitall parts they past,<br>
Ne ought could them endure, but all they cleft or brast.<p>

Which cruell outrage when as <i>Artegall</i><br>
Did well auize, thenceforth with warie heed<br>
He shund his strokes, where euer they did fall,<br>
And way did giue vnto their gracelesse speed:<br>
As when a skilfull Marriner doth reed<br>
A storme approching, that doth perill threat,<br>
He will not bide the daunger of such dread,<br>
But strikes his sayles, and vereth his mainsheat,<br>
And lends vnto it leaue the emptie ayre to beat.<p>

So did the Faerie knight himselfe abeare,<br>
And stouped oft his head from shame to shield;<br>
No shame to stoupe, ones head more high to reare,<br>
And much to gaine, a litle for to yield;<br>
So stoutest knights doen oftentimes in field.<br>
But still the tyrant sternely at him layd,<br>
And did his yron axe so nimbly wield,<br>
That many wounds into his flesh it made,<br>
And with his burdenous blowes him sore did ouerlade.<p>

Yet when as fit aduantage he did spy,<br>
The whiles the cursed felon high did reare<br>
His cruell hand, to smite him mortally,<br>
Vnder his stroke he to him stepping neare,<br>
Right in the flanke him strooke with deadly dreare,<br>
That the gore bloud thence gushing grieuously,<br>
Did vnderneath him like a pond appeare,<br>
And all his armour did with purple dye;<br>
Thereat he brayed loud, and yelled dreadfully.<p>

Yet the huge stroke, which he before intended,<br>
Kept on his course, as he did it direct,<br>
And with such monstrous poise adowne descended,<br>
That seemed nought could him from death protect:<br>
But he it well did ward with wise respect,<br>
And twixt him and the blow his shield did cast,<br>
Which thereon seizing, tooke no great effect;<br>
But byting deepe therein did sticke so fast,<br>
That by no meanes it backe againe he forth could wrast.<p>

Long while he tug'd and stroue, to get it out,<br>
And all his powre applyed thereunto,<br>
That he therewith the knight drew all about:<br>
Nathlesse, for all that euer he could doe,<br>
His axe he could not from his shield vndoe.<br>
Which <i>Artegall</i> perceiuing, strooke no more,<br>
But loosing soone his shield, did it forgoe,<br>
And whiles he combred was therewith so sore,<br>
He gan at him let driue more fiercely then afore.<p>

So well he him pursew'd, that at the last,<br>
He stroke him with <i>Chrysaor</i> on the hed,<br>
That with the souse thereof full sore aghast,<br>
He staggered to and fro in doubtfull sted.<br>
Againe whiles he him saw so ill bested,<br>
He did him smite with all his might and maine,<br>
That falling on his mother earth he fed:<br>
Whom when he saw prostrated on the plaine,<br>
He lightly reft his head, to ease him of his paine.<p>

Which when the people round about him saw,<br>
They shouted all for ioy of his successe,<br>
Glad to be quit from that proud Tyrants awe,<br>
Which with strong powre did them long time oppresse;<br>
And running all with greedie ioyfulnesse<br>
To faire <i>Irena</i>, at her feet did fall,<br>
And her adored with due humblenesse,<br>
As their true Liege and Princesse naturall;<br>
And eke her champions glorie sounded ouer all.<p>

Who streight her leading with meete maiestie<br>
Vnto the pallace, where their kings did rayne,<br>
Did her therein establish peaceablie,<br>
And to her kingdomes seat restore agayne;<br>
And all such persons, as did late maintayne<br>
That Tyrants part, with close or open ayde,<br>
He sorely punished with heauie payne;<br>
That in short space, whiles there with her he stayd,<br>
Not one was left, that durst her once haue disobayd.<p>

During which time, that he did there remaine,<br>
His studie was true Iustice how to deale,<br>
And day and night employ'd his busie paine<br>
How to reforme that ragged common-weale:<br>
And that same yron man which could reueale<br>
All hidden crimes, through all that realme he sent,<br>
To search out those, that vsd to rob and steale,<br>
Or did rebell gainst lawfull gouernment;<br>
On whom he did inflict most grieuous punishment.<p>

But ere he could reforme it thoroughly,<br>
He through occasion called was away,<br>
To Faerie Court, that of necessity<br>
His course of Iustice he was forst to stay,<br>
And <i>Talus</i> to reuoke from the right way,<br>
In which he was that Realme for to redresse.<br>
But enuies cloud still dimmeth vertues ray.<br>
So hauing freed <i>Irena</i> from distresse,<br>
He tooke his leaue of her, there left in heauinesse.<p>

Tho as he backe returned from that land,<br>
And there arriu'd againe, whence forth he set,<br>
He had not passed farre vpon the strand,<br>
When as two old ill fauour'd Hags he met,<br>
By the way side being together set,<br>
Two griesly creatures; and, to that their faces<br>
Most foule and filthie were, their garments yet<br>
Being all rag'd and tatter'd, their disgraces<br>
Did much the more augment, and made most vgly cases.<p>

The one of them, that elder did appeare,<br>
With her dull eyes did seeme to looke askew,<br>
That her mis-shape much helpt; and her foule heare<br>
Hung loose and loathsomely: Thereto her hew<br>
Was wan and leane, that all her teeth arew,<br>
And all her bones might through her cheekes be red;<br>
Her lips were like raw lether, pale and blew,<br>
And as she spake, therewith she slauered;<br>
Yet spake she seldom, but thought more, the lesse she sed.<p>

Her hands were foule and durtie, neuer washt<br>
In all her life, with long nayles ouer raught,<br>
Like puttocks clawes: with th'one of which she scracht<br>
Her cursed head, although it itched naught;<br>
The other held a snake with venime fraught,<br>
On which she fed, and gnawed hungrily,<br>
As if that long she had not eaten ought;<br>
That round about her iawes one might descry<br>
The bloudie gore and poyson dropping lothsomely.<p>

Her name was <i>Enuie</i>, knowen well thereby;<br>
Whose nature is to grieue, and grudge at all,<br>
That euer she sees doen prays-worthily,<br>
Whose sight to her is greatest crosse, may fall,<br>
And vexeth so, that makes her eat her gall.<br>
For when she wanteth other thing to eat,<br>
She feedes on her owne maw vnnaturall,<br>
And of her owne foule entrayles makes her meat;<br>
Meat fit for such a monsters monsterous dyeat.<p>

And if she hapt of any good to heare,<br>
That had to any happily betid,<br>
Then would she inly fret, and grieue, and teare<br>
Her flesh for felnesse, which she inward hid:<br>
But if she heard of ill, that any did,<br>
Or harme, that any had, then would she make<br>
Great cheare, like one vnto a banquet bid;<br>
And in anothers losse great pleasure take,<br>
As she had got thereby, and gayned a great stake.<p>

The other nothing better was, then shee;<br>
Agreeing in bad will and cancred kynd,<br>
But in bad maner they did disagree:<br>
For what so <i>Enuie</i> good or bad did fynd,<br>
She did conceale, and murder her owne mynd;<br>
But this, what euer euill she conceiued,<br>
Did spred abroad, and throw in th'open wynd.<br>
Yet this in all her words might be perceiued,<br>
That all she sought, was mens good name to haue bereaued.<p>

For what soeuer good by any sayd,<br>
Or doen she heard, she would streightwayes inuent,<br>
How to depraue, or slaunderously vpbrayd,<br>
Or to misconstrue of a mans intent,<br>
And turne to ill the thing, that well was ment.<br>
Therefore she vsed often to resort,<br>
To common haunts, and companies frequent,<br>
To hearke what any one did good report,<br>
To blot the same with blame, or wrest in wicked sort.<p>

And if that any ill she heard of any,<br>
She would it eeke, and make much worse by telling,<br>
And take great ioy to publish it to many,<br>
That euery matter worse was for her melling,<br>
Her name was hight <i>Detraction</i>, and her dwelling<br>
Was neare to <i>Enuie</i>, euen her neighbour next;<br>
A wicked hag, and <i>Enuy</i> selfe excelling<br>
In mischiefe: for her selfe she onely vext;<br>
But this same both her selfe, and others eke perplext.<p>

Her face was vgly, and her mouth distort,<br>
Foming with poyson round about her gils,<br>
In which her cursed tongue full sharpe and short<br>
Appear'd like Aspis sting, that closely kils,<br>
Or cruelly does wound, whom so she wils:<br>
A distaffe in her other hand she had,<br>
Vpon the which she litle spinnes, but spils,<br>
And faynes to weaue false tales and leasings bad,<br>
To throw amongst the good, which others had disprad.<p>

These two now had themselues combynd in one,<br>
And linckt together gainst Sir <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
For whom they wayted as his mortall fone,<br>
How they might make him into mischiefe fall,<br>
For freeing from their snares <i>Irena</i> thrall:<br>
Besides vnto themselues they gotten had<br>
A monster, which the <i>Blatant beast</i> men call,<br>
A dreadfull feend of gods and men ydrad,<br>
Whom they by slights allur'd, and to their purpose lad.<p>

Such were these Hags, and so vnhandsome drest:<br>
Who when they nigh approching, had espyde<br>
Sir <i>Artegall</i> return'd from his late quest,<br>
They both arose, and at him loudly cryde,<br>
As it had bene two shepheards curres, had scryde<br>
A rauenous Wolfe amongst the scattered flockes.<br>
And <i>Enuie</i> first, as she that first him eyde,<br>
Towardes him runs, and with rude flaring lockes<br>
About her eares, does beat her brest, &amp; forhead knockes.<p>

Then from her mouth the gobbet she does take,<br>
The which whyleare she was so greedily<br>
Deuouring, euen that halfe-gnawen snake,<br>
And at him throwes it most despightfully.<br>
The cursed Serpent, though she hungrily<br>
Earst chawd thereon, yet was not all so dead,<br>
But that some life remayned secretly,<br>
And as he past afore withouten dread,<br>
Bit him behind, that long the marke was to be read.<p>

Then th'other comming neare, gan him reuile,<br>
And fouly rayle, with all she could inuent;<br>
Saying, that he had with vnmanly guile,<br>
And foule abusion both his honour blent,<br>
And that bright sword, the sword of Iustice lent,<br>
Had stayned with reprochfull crueltie,<br>
In guiltlesse blood of many an innocent:<br>
As for <i>Grandtorto</i>, him with treacherie<br>
And traynes hauing surpriz'd, he fouly did to die.<p>

Thereto the Blatant beast by them set on<br>
At him began aloud to barke and bay,<br>
With bitter rage and fell contention,<br>
That all the woods and rockes nigh to that way,<br>
Began to quake and tremble with dismay;<br>
And all the aire rebellowed againe.<br>
So dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray,<br>
And euermore those hags them selues did paine,<br>
To sharpen him, and their owne cursed tongs did straine.<p>

And still among most bitter wordes they spake,<br>
Most shamefull, most vnrighteous, most vntrew,<br>
That they the mildest man aliue would make<br>
Forget his patience, and yeeld vengeaunce dew<br>
To her, that so false sclaunders at him threw.<br>
And more to make th&#7869; pierce &amp; wound more deepe,<br>
She with the sting, which in her vile tongue grew,<br>
Did sharpen them, and in fresh poyson steepe:<br>
Yet he past on, and seem'd of them to take no keepe.<p>

But <i>Talus</i> hearing her so lewdly raile,<br>
And speake so ill of him, that well deserued,<br>
Would her haue chastiz'd with his yron flaile,<br>
If her Sir <i>Artegall</i> had not preserued,<br>
And him forbidden, who his heast obserued.<br>
So much the more at him still did she scold,<br>
And stones did cast, yet he for nought would swerue<br>
From his right course, but still the way did hold<br>
To Faery Court, where what him fell shall else be told.<p>
