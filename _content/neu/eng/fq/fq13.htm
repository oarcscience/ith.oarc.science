<blockquote>
R
Ight well I wote most mighty Soueraine,<br>
That all this famous antique history,<br>
Of some th'aboundance of an idle braine<br>
Will iudged be, and painted forgery,<br>
Rather then matter of iust memory,<br>
Sith none, that breatheth liuing aire, does know,<br>
Where is that happy land of Faery,<br>
Which I so much do vaunt, yet no where show,<br>
But vouch antiquities, which no body can know.<p>
 
But let that man with better sence aduize,<br>
That of the world least part to vs is red:<br>
And dayly how through hardy enterprize,<br>
Many great Regions are discouered,<br>
Which to late age were neuer mentioned.<br>
Who euer heard of th'Indian <i>Peru</i>?<br>
Or who in venturous vessell measured<br>
The <i>Amazon</i> huge riuer now found trew?<br>
Or fruitfullest <i>Virginia</i> who did euer vew?<p>
 
Yet all these were, when no man did them know;<br>
Yet haue from wisest ages hidden beene:<br>
And later times things more vnknowne shall show.<br>
Why then should witlesse man so much misweene<br>
That nothing is, but that which he hath seene?<br>
What if within the Moones faire shining spheare?<br>
What if in euery other starre vnseene<br>
Of other worldes he happily should heare?<br>
He w&otilde;der would much more: yet such to some appeare.<p>
 
Of Faerie lond yet if he more inquire,<br>
By certaine signes here set in sundry place<br>
He may it find; ne let him then admire,<br>
But yield his sence to be too blunt and bace,<br>
That no'te without an hound fine footing trace.<br>
And thou, O fairest Princesse vnder sky,<br>
In this faire mirrhour maist behold thy face,<br>
And thine owne realmes in lond of Faery,<br>
And in this antique Image thy great auncestry.<p>
 
The which O pardon me thus to enfold<br>
In couert vele, and wrap in shadowes light,<br>
That feeble eyes your glory may behold,<br>
Which else could not endure those beames bright,<br>
But would be dazled with exceeding light.<br>
O pardon, and vouchsafe with patient eare<br>
The braue aduentures of this Faery knight<br>
The good Sir <i>Guyon</i> gratiously to heare,<br>
In whom great rule of Temp'raunce goodly doth appeare.<p>
