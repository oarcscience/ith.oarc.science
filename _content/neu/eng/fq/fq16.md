*Cant. III.*

> *Vaine Braggadocchio getting Guyons  
> horse is made the scorne  
> Of knighthood trew, and is of fayre  
> Belphoebe fowle forlorne.*

> S Oone as the morrow faire with purple beames  
> Disperst the shadowes of the mistie night,  
> And *Titan* playing on the eastern streames,  
> cleare the deawy ayre with springing light,  
> Sir *Guyon* mindfull of his vow yplight,  
> Vprose from drowsie couch, and him addrest  
> Vnto the iourney which he had behight:  
> His puissaunt armes about his noble brest,  
> And many-folded shield he bound about his wrest.
>
> Then taking *Congé* of that virgin pure,  
> The bloudy-handed babe vnto her truth  
> Did earnestly commit, and her coniure,  
> In vertuous lore to traine his tender youth,  
> And all that gentle noriture ensu'th:  
> And that so soone as ryper yeares he raught,  
> He might for memorie of that dayes ruth,  
> Be called *Ruddymane*, and thereby taught,  
> T'auenge his Parẽts death on them, that had it wrought.
>
> So forth he far'd, as now befell, on foot,  
> Sith his good steed is lately from him gone;  
> Patience perforce; helpelesse what may it boot  
> To fret for anger, or for griefe to mone?  
> His Palmer now shall foot no more alone:  
> So fortune wrought, as vnder greene woods syde  
> He lately heard that dying Lady grone,  
> He left his steed without, and speare besyde,  
> And rushed in on foot to ayd her, ere she dyde.
>
> The whiles a losell wandring by the way,  
> One that to bountie neuer cast his mind,  
> Ne thought of honour euer did assay  
> His baser brest, but in his kestrell kind  
> A pleasing vaine of glory vaine did find,  
> To which his flowing toung, and troublous spright  
> Gaue him great ayd, and made him more inclind:  
> He that braue steed there finding ready dight,  
> Purloynd both steed and speare, and ran away full light.
>
> Now gan his hart all swell in iollitie,  
> And of him selfe great hope and helpe conceiu'd,  
> That puffed vp with smoke of vanitie,  
> And with selfe-loued personage deceiu'd,  
> He gan to hope, of men to be receiu'd  
> For such, as he him thought, or faine would bee:  
> But for in court gay portaunce he perceiu'd,  
> And gallant shew to be in greatest gree,  
> Eftsoones to court he cast t'auaunce his first degree.
>
> And by the way he chaunced to espy  
> One sitting idle on a sunny bancke,  
> To whom auaunting in great brauery,  
> As Peacocke, that his painted plumes doth prancke,  
> He smote his courser in the trembling flancke,  
> And to him threatned his hart-thrilling speare:  
> The seely man seeing him ryde so rancke,  
> And ayme at him, fell flat to ground for feare,  
> And crying Mercy lowd, his pitious hands gan reare.
>
> Thereat the Scarcrow wexed wondrous prowd,  
> Through fortune of his first aduenture faire,  
> And with big thundring voyce reuyld him lowd;  
> Vile Caytiue, vassall of dread and despaire,  
> Vnworthie of the commune breathed aire,  
> Why liuest thou, dead dog, a lenger day,  
> And doest not vnto death thy selfe prepaire.  
> Dye, or thy selfe my captiue yield for ay;  
> Great fauour I thee graunt, for aunswere thus to stay.
>
> Hold, ô deare Lord, hold your dead-doing hand,  
> Then loud he cryde, I am your humble thrall.  
> Ah wretch (quoth he) thy destinies withstand  
> My wrathfull will, and do for mercy call.  
> I giue thee life: therefore prostrated fall,  
> And kisse my stirrup; that thy homage bee.  
> The Miser threw him selfe, as an Offall,  
> Streight at his foot in base humilitee,  
> And cleeped him his liege, to hold of him in fee.
>
> So happy peace they made and faire accord:  
> Eftsoones this liege-man gan to wexe more bold,  
> And when he felt the folly of his Lord,  
> In his owne kind he gan him selfe vnfold:  
> For he was wylie witted, and growne old  
> In cunning sleights and practick knauery.  
> From that day forth he cast for to vphold  
> His idle humour with fine flattery,  
> And blow the bellowes to his swelling vanity.
>
> *Trompart* fit man for *Braggadocchio*,  
> To serue at court in view of vaunting eye;  
> Vaine-glorious man, when fluttring wind does blow  
> In his light wings, is lifted vp to skye:  
> The scorne of knighthood and trew cheualrye,  
> To thinke without desert of gentle deed,  
> And noble worth to be aduaunced hye:  
> Such prayse is shame; but honour vertues meed  
> Doth beare the fairest flowre in honorable seed.
>
> So forth they pas, a well consorted paire,  
> Till that at length with *Archimage* they meet:  
> Who seeing one that shone in armour faire,  
> On goodly courser thundring with his feet,  
> Eftsoones supposed him a person meet,  
> Of his reuenge to make the instrument:  
> For since the *Redcrosse* knight he earst did weet,  
> To beene with *Guyon* knit in one consent,  
> The ill, which earst to him, he now to *Guyon* ment.
>
> And comming close to *Trompart* gan inquere  
> Of him, what mighty warriour that mote bee,  
> That rode in golden sell with single spere,  
> But wanted sword to wreake his enmitee.  
> He is a great aduenturer, (said he)  
> That hath his sword through hard assay forgone,  
> And now hath vowd, till he auenged bee,  
> Of that despight, neuer to wearen none;  
> That speare is him enough to doen a thousand grone.
>
> Th'enchaunter greatly ioyed in the vaunt,  
> And weened well ere long his will to win,  
> And both his foen with equall foyle to daunt.  
> Tho to him louting lowly, did begin  
> To plaine of wrongs, which had committed bin  
> By *Guyon*, and by that false *Redcrosse* knight,  
> Which two through treason and deceiptfull gin,  
> Had slaine Sir *Mordant*, and his Lady bright:  
> That mote him honour win, to wreake so foule despight.
>
> Therewith all suddeinly he seemd enraged,  
> And threatned death with dreadfull countenaunce,  
> As if their liues had in his hand beene gaged;  
> And with stiffe force shaking his mortall launce,  
> To let him weet his doughtie valiaunce,  
> Thus said; Old man, great sure shalbe thy meed,  
> If where those knights for feare of dew vengeaunce  
> Do lurke, thou certainly to me areed,  
> That I may wreake on them their hainous hatefull deed.
>
> Certes, my Lord, (said he) that shall I soone,  
> And giue you eke good helpe to their decay,  
> But mote I wisely you aduise to doon;  
> Giue no ods to your foes, but do puruay  
> Your selfe of sword before that bloudy day:  
> For they be two the prowest knights on ground,  
> And oft approu'd in many hard assay,  
> And eke of surest steele, that may be found,  
> Do arme your selfe against that day, them to confound.
>
> Dotard (said he) let be thy deepe aduise;  
> Seemes that through many yeares thy wits thee faile,  
> And that weake eld hath left thee nothing wise,  
> Else neuer should thy iudgement be so fraile,  
> To measure manhood by the sword or maile.  
> Is not enough foure quarters of a man,  
> Withouten sword or shield, an host to quaile?  
> Thou little wotest, what this right hand can:  
> Speake they, which haue beheld the battailes, which it wan.
>
> The man was much abashed at his boast;  
> Yet well he wist, that who so would contend  
> With either of those knights on euen coast,  
> Should need of all his armes, him to defend;  
> Yet feared least his boldnesse should offend,  
> When *Braggadocchio* said, Once I did sweare,  
> When with one sword seuen knights I brought to end,  
> Thence forth in battell neuer sword to beare,  
> But it were that, which noblest knight on earth doth weare.
>
> Perdie Sir knight, said then th'enchaunter bliue,  
> That shall I shortly purchase to your hond:  
> For now the best and noblest knight aliue  
> Prince *Arthur* is, that wonnes in Faerie lond;  
> He hath a sword, that flames like burning brond.  
> The same by my deuice I vndertake  
> Shall by to morrow by thy side be fond.  
> At which bold word that boaster gan to quake,  
> And wondred in his mind, what mote that monster make.
>
> He stayd not for more bidding, but away  
> Was suddein vanished out of his sight:  
> The Northerne wind his wings did broad display  
> At his commaund, and reared him vp light  
> From off the earth to take his aerie flight.  
> They lookt about, but no where could espie  
> Tract of his foot: then dead through great affright  
> They both nigh were, and each bad other flie:  
> Both fled attonce, ne euer backe returned eie.
>
> Till that they come vnto a forrest greene,  
> In which they shrowd thẽselues from causelesse feare;  
> Yet feare them followes still, where so they beene,  
> Each trembling leafe, and whistling wind they heare,  
> As ghastly bug their haire on end does reare:  
> Yet both doe striue their fearfulnesse to faine.  
> At last they heard a horne, that shrilled cleare  
> Throughout the wood, that ecchoed againe,  
> And made the forrest ring, as it would riue in twaine.
>
> Eft through the thicke they heard one rudely rush;  
> With noyse whereof he from his loftie steed  
> Downe fell to ground, and crept into a bush,  
> To hide his coward head from dying dreed.  
> But *Trompart* stoutly stayd to taken heed,  
> Of what might hap. Eftsoone there stepped forth  
> A goodly Ladie clad in hunters weed,  
> That seemd to be a woman of great worth,  
> And by her stately portance, borne of heauenly birth.
>
> Her face so faire as flesh it seemed not,  
> But heauenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew,  
> Cleare as the skie, withouten blame or blot,  
> Through goodly mixture of complexions dew;  
> And in her cheekes the vermeill red did shew  
> Like roses in a bed of lillies shed,  
> The which ambrosiall odours from them threw,  
> And gazers sense with double pleasure fed,  
> Hable to heale the sicke, and to reuiue the ded.
>
> In her faire eyes two liuing lamps did flame,  
> Kindled aboue at th'heauenly makers light,  
> And darted fyrie beames out of the same,  
> So passing persant, and so wondrous bright,  
> That quite bereau'd the rash beholders sight:  
> In them the blinded god his lustfull fire  
> To kindle oft assayd, but had no might;  
> For with dredd Maiestie, and awfull ire,  
> She broke his wanton darts, and quenched base desire.
>
> Her iuorie forhead, full of bountie braue,  
> Like a broad table did it selfe dispred,  
> For Loue his loftie triumphes to engraue,  
> And write the battels of his great godhed:  
> All good and honour might therein be red:  
> For there their dwelling was. And when she spake,  
> Sweet words, like dropping honny she did shed,  
> And twixt the perles and rubins softly brake  
> A siluer sound, that heauenly musicke seemd to make.
>
> Vpon her eyelids many Graces sate,  
> Vnder the shadow of her euen browes,  
> Working belgards, and amorous retrate,  
> And euery one her with a grace endowes:  
> And euery one with meekenesse to her bowes.  
> So glorious mirrhour of celestiall grace,  
> And soueraine moniment of mortall vowes,  
> How shall fraile pen descriue her heauenly face,  
> For feare through want of skill her beautie to disgrace?
>
> So faire, and thousand thousand times more faire  
> She seemd, when she presented was to sight,  
> And was yclad, for heat of scorching aire,  
> All in a silken Camus lylly whight,  
> Purfled vpon with many a folded plight,  
> Which all aboue besprinckled was throughout,  
> With golden aygulets, that glistred bright,  
> Like twinckling starres, and all the skirt about  
> Was hemd with golden fringe
>
> Below her ham her weed were somewhat traine,  
> And her streight legs most brauely were embayld  
> In gilden buskins of costly Cordwaine,  
> All bard with golden bendes, which were entayld  
> With curious antickes, and full faire aumayld:  
> Before they fastned were vnder her knee  
> In a rich Iewell, and therein entrayld  
> The ends of all their knots, that none might see,  
> How they within their fouldings close enwrapped bee.
>
> Like two faire marble pillours they were seene,  
> Which doe the temple of the Gods support,  
> Whom all the people decke with girlands greene,  
> And honour in their festiuall resort;  
> Those same with stately grace, and princely port  
> She taught to tread, when she her selfe would grace,  
> But with the wooddie Nymphes when she did play,  
> Or when the flying Libbard she did chace,  
> She could them nimbly moue, and after fly apace.
>
> And in her hand a sharpe bore-speare she held,  
> And at her backe a bow and quiuer gay,  
> Stuft with steele-headed darts, wherewith she queld  
> The saluage beastes in her victorious play,  
> Knit with a golden bauldricke, which forelay  
> Athwart her snowy brest, and did diuide  
> Her daintie paps; which like young fruit in May  
> Now little gan to swell, and being tide,  
> Through her thin weed their places only signifide.
>
> Her yellow lockes crisped, like golden wyre,  
> About her shoulders weren loosely shed,  
> And when the winde emongst them did inspyre,  
> They waued like a penon wide dispred,  
> And low behinde her backe were scattered:  
> And whether art it were, or heedlesse hap,  
> As through the flouring forrest rash she fled,  
> In her rude haires sweet flowres themselues did lap,  
> And flourishing fresh leaues and blossomes did enwrap.
>
> Such as *Diana* by the sandie shore  
> Of swift *Eurotas*, or on *Cynthus* greene,  
> Where all the Nymphes haue her vnwares forlore,  
> Wandreth alone with bow and arrowes keene,  
> To seeke her game: Or as that famous Queene  
> Of *Amazons*, whom *Pyrrhus* did destroy,  
> The day that first of *Priame* she was seene,  
> Did shew her selfe in great triumphant ioy,  
> To succour the weake state of sad afflicted *Troy*.
>
> Such when as hartlesse *Trompart* her did vew,  
> He was dismayed in his coward mind,  
> And doubted, whether he himselfe should shew,  
> Or fly away, or bide alone behind:  
> Both feare and hope he in her face did find,  
> When she at last him spying thus bespake;  
> Hayle Groome; didst not thou see a bleeding Hind,  
> Whose right haunch earst my stedfast arrow strake?  
> If thou didst, tell me, that I may her ouertake.
>
> Wherewith reviu'd, this answere forth he threw;  
> O Goddesse, (for such I thee take to bee)  
> For neither doth thy face terrestriall shew,  
> Nor voyce sound mortall; I auow to thee,  
> Such wounded beast, as that, I did not see,  
> Sith earst into this forrest wild I came.  
> But mote thy goodlyhed forgiue it mee,  
> To weet, which of the Gods I shall thee name,  
> That vnto thee due worship I may rightly frame.
>
> To whom she thus; but ere her words ensewed,  
> Vnto the bush her eye did suddein glaunce,  
> In which vaine *Braggadocchio* was mewed,  
> And saw it stirre: she left her percing launce,  
> And towards gan a deadly shaft aduaunce,  
> In mind to marke the beast. At which sad stowre,  
> *Trompart* forth stept, to stay the mortall chaunce,  
> Out crying, ô what euer heauenly powre,  
> Or earthly wight thou be, withhold this deadly howre.
>
> O stay thy hand, for yonder is no game  
> For thy fierce arrowes, them to exercize,  
> But loe my Lord, my liege, whose warlike name,  
> Is farre renowmd through many bold emprize;  
> And now in shade he shrowded yonder lies.  
> She staid: with that he crauld out of his nest,  
> Forth creeping on his caitiue hands and thies,  
> And standing stoutly vp, his loftie crest  
> Did fiercely shake, and rowze, as comming late from rest.
>
> As fearefull fowle, that long in secret caue  
> For dread of soaring hauke her selfe hath hid,  
> Not caring how, her silly life to saue,  
> She her gay painted plumes disorderid,  
> Seeing at last her selfe from daunger rid,  
> Peepes foorth, and soone renewes her natiue pride;  
> She gins her feathers foule disfigured  
> Proudly to prune, and set on euery side,  
> So shakes off shame, ne thinks how erst she did her hide.
>
> So when her goodly visage he beheld,  
> He gan himselfe to vaunt: but when he vewed  
> Those deadly tooles, which in her hand she held,  
> Soone into other fits he was transmewed,  
> Till she to him her gratious speach renewed;  
> All haile, Sir knight, and well may thee befall,  
> As all the like, which honour haue pursewed  
> Through deedes of armes and prowesse martiall;  
> All vertue merits praise, but such the most of all
>
> To whom he thus: ô fairest vnder skie,  
> True be thy words, and worthy of thy praise,  
> That warlike feats doest highest glorifie.  
> Therein haue I spent all my youthly daies,  
> And many battailes fought, and many fraies  
> Throughout the world, wher so they might be found,  
> Endeuouring my dreadded name to raise  
> Aboue the Moone, that fame may it resound  
> In her eternall trompe, with laurell girland cround.
>
> But what art thou, ô Ladie, which doest raunge  
> In this wilde forrest, where no pleasure is,  
> And doest not it for ioyous court exchaunge,  
> Emongst thine equall peres, where happie blis  
> And all delight does raigne, much more then this?  
> There thou maist loue, and dearely loued bee,  
> And swim in pleasure, which thou here doest mis;  
> There maist thou best be seene, and best maist see:  
> The wood is fit for beasts, the court is fit for thee.
>
> Who so in pompe of proud estate (quoth she)  
> Does swim, and bathes himselfe in courtly blis,  
> Does waste his dayes in darke obscuritee,  
> And in obliuion euer buried is:  
> Where ease abounds, yt's eath to doe amis;  
> But who his limbs with labours, and his mind  
> Behaues with cares, cannot so easie mis.  
> Abroad in armes, at home in studious kind  
> Who seekes with painfull toile, shall honour soonest find.
>
> In woods, in waues, in warres she wonts to dwell,  
> And will be found with perill and with paine;  
> Ne can the man, that moulds in idle cell,  
> Vnto her happie mansion attaine:  
> Before her gate high God did Sweat ordaine,  
> And wakefull watches euer to abide:  
> But easie is the way, and passage plaine  
> To pleasures pallace; it may soone be spide,  
> And day and night her dores to all stand open wide.
>
> In Princes court,---The rest she would haue said,  
> But that the foolish man, fild with delight  
> Of her sweet words, that all his sence dismaid,  
> And with her wondrous beautie rauisht quight,  
> Gan burne in filthy lust, and leaping light,  
> Thought in his bastard armes her to embrace.  
> With that she swaruing backe, her Iauelin bright  
> Against him bent, and fiercely did menace:  
> So turned her about, and fled away apace.
>
> Which when the Peasant saw, amazd he stood,  
> And grieued at her flight; yet durst he not  
> Pursew her steps, through wild vnknowen wood;  
> Besides he feard her wrath, and threatned shot  
> Whiles in the bush he lay, not yet forgot:  
> Ne car'd he greatly for her presence vaine,  
> But turning said to *Trompart*, What foule blot  
> Is this to knight, that Ladie should againe  
> Depart to woods vntoucht, & leaue so proud disdaine?
>
> Perdie (said *Trompart*) let her passe at will,  
> Least by her presence daunger mote befall.  
> For who can tell (and sure I feare it ill)  
> But that she is some powre celestiall?  
> For whiles she spake, her great words did apall  
> My feeble courage, and my hart oppresse,  
> That yet I quake and tremble ouer all.  
> And I (said *Braggadocchio*) thought no lesse,  
> When first I heard her horne sound with such ghastlinesse.
>
> For from my mothers wombe this grace I haue  
> Me giuen by eternall destinie,  
> That earthly thing may not my courage braue  
> Dismay with feare, or cause one foot to flie,  
> But either hellish feends, or powres on hie:  
> Which was the cause, when earst that horne I heard,  
> Weening it had beene thunder in the skie,  
> I hid my selfe from it, as one affeard;  
> But when I other knew, my selfe I boldly reard.
>
> But now for feare of worse, that may betide,  
> Let vs soone hence depart. They soone agree;  
> So to his steed he got, and gan to ride,  
> As one vnfit therefore, that all might see  
> He had not trayned bene in cheualree.  
> Which well that valiant courser did discerne;  
> For he despysd to tread in dew degree,  
> But chaufd and fom'd, with courage fierce and sterne,  
> And to be easd of that base burden still did erne.
