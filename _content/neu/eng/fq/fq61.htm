<i>Arthur and Artegall catch Guyle<br>
whom Talus doth dismay,<br>
They to Mercillaes pallace come,<br>
and see her rich array.</i><p>

<blockquote>
W
Hat Tygre, or what other saluage wight<br>
Is so exceeding furious and fell,<br>
As Wrong, when it hath arm'd it selfe with might?<br>
Not fit mongst men, that doe with reason mell,<br>
But mongst wyld beasts and saluage woods to dwell;<br>
Where still the stronger doth the weake deuoure,<br>
And they that most in boldnesse doe excell,<br>
Are dreadded most, and feared for their powre:<br>
Fit for <i>Adicia</i>, there to build her wicked bowre.<p>

There let her wonne farre from resort of men,<br>
Where righteous <i>Artegall</i> her late exyled;<br>
There let her euer keepe her damned den,<br>
Where none may be with her lewd parts defyled,<br>
Nor none but beasts may be of her despoyled:<br>
And turne we to the noble Prince, where late<br>
We did him leaue, after that he had foyled<br>
The cruell Souldan, and with dreadfull fate<br>
Had vtterly subuerted his vnrighteous state.<p>

Where hauing with Sir <i>Artegall</i> a space<br>
Well solast in that Souldans late delight,<br>
They both resoluing now to leaue the place,<br>
Both it and all the wealth therein behight<br>
Vnto that Damzell in her Ladies right,<br>
And so would haue departed on their way.<br>
But she them woo'd by all the meanes she might,<br>
And earnestly besought, to wend that day<br>
With her, to see her Ladie thence no farre away.<p>

By whose entreatie both they ouercommen,<br>
Agree to goe with her, and by the way,<br>
(As often falles) of sundry things did commen.<br>
Mongst which that Damzell did to them bewray<br>
A straunge aduenture, which not farre thence lay;<br>
To weet a wicked villaine, bold and stout,<br>
Which wonned in a rocke not farre away,<br>
That robbed all the countrie there about,<br>
And brought the pillage home, whence none could get it out.<p>

Thereto both his owne wylie wit, (she sayd)<br>
And eke the fastnesse of his dwelling place,<br>
Both vnassaylable, gaue him great ayde:<br>
For he so crafty was to forge and face,<br>
So light of hand, and nymble of his pace,<br>
So smooth of tongue, and subtile in his tale.<br>
That could deceiue one looking in his face;<br>
Therefore by name <i>Malengin</i> they him call,<br>
Well knowen by his feates, and famous ouer all.<p>

Through these his slights he many doth confound,<br>
And eke the rocke, in which he wonts to dwell,<br>
Is wondrous strong, and hewen farre vnder ground<br>
A dreadfull depth, how deepe no man can tell;<br>
But some doe say, it goeth downe to hell.<br>
And all within, it full of wyndings is,<br>
And hidden wayes, that scarse an hound by smell<br>
Can follow out those false footsteps of his,<br>
Ne none can backe returne, that once are gone amis.<p>

Which when those knights had heard, their harts gan earne,<br>
To vnderstand that villeins dwelling place,<br>
And greatly it desir'd of her to learne,<br>
And by which way they towards it should trace.<br>
Were not (sayd she) that it should let your pace<br>
Towards my Ladies presence by you ment,<br>
I would you guyde directly to the place.<br>
Then let not that (said they) stay your intent;<br>
For neither will one foot, till we that carle haue hent.<p>

So froth they past, till they apporched ny<br>
Vnto the rocke, where was the villains won:<br>
Which when the Damzell neare at hand did spy,<br>
She warn'd the knights thereof: who thereupon<br>
Gan to aduize, what best were to be done.<br>
So both agreed, to send that mayd afore,<br>
Where she might sit nigh to the den alone,<br>
Wayling, and raysing pittifull vprore,<br>
As if she did some great calamitie deplore.<p>

With noyse whereof when as the caytiue carle<br>
Should issue forth, in hope to find some spoyle,<br>
They in awayt would closely him ensnarle,<br>
Ere to his den he backward could recoyle,<br>
And so would hope him easily to foyle.<br>
The Damzell straight went, as she was directed,<br>
Vnto the rocke, and there vpon the soyle<br>
Hauing her selfe in wretched wize abiected,<br>
Gan weepe and wayle, as if great griefe had her affected.<p>

The cry whereof entring the hollow caue,<br>
Eftsoones brought forth the villaine, as they ment,<br>
With hope of her some wishfull boot to haue.<br>
Full dreadfull wight he was, as euer went<br>
Vpon the earth, with hollow eyes deepe pent,<br>
And long curld locks, that downe his shoulders shagged,<br>
And on his backe an vncouth vestiment<br>
Made of straunge stuffe, but all to worne and ragged,<br>
And vnderneath his breech was all to torne and iagged.<p>

And in his hand an huge long staffe he held,<br>
Whose top was arm'd with many an yron hooke,<br>
Fit to catch hold of all that he could weld,<br>
Or in the compasse of his clouches tooke;<br>
And euer round about he cast his looke.<br>
Als at his backe a great wyde net he bore,<br>
With which he seldome fished at the brooke,<br>
But vsd to fish for fooles on the dry shore,<br>
Of which he in faire weather wont to take great store.<p>

Him when the damzell saw fast by her side,<br>
So vgly creature, she was nigh dismayd,<br>
And now for helpe aloud in earnest cride.<br>
But when the villaine saw her so affrayd,<br>
He gan with guilefull words her to perswade,<br>
To banish feare, and with <i>Sardonian</i> smyle<br>
Laughing on her, his false intent to shade,<br>
Gan forth to lay his bayte her to beguyle,<br>
That from her self vnwares he might her steale the whyle.<p>

Like as the fouler on his guilefull pype<br>
Charmes to the birds full many a pleasant lay,<br>
That they the whiles may take lesse heedie keepe,<br>
How he his nets doth for their ruine lay:<br>
So did the villaine to her prate and play,<br>
And many pleasant trickes before her show,<br>
To turne her eyes from his intent away:<br>
For he in slights and iugling feates did flow,<br>
And of legierdemayne the mysteries did know.<p>

To which whilest she lent her intentiue mind,<br>
He suddenly his net vpon her threw,<br>
That ouersprad her like a puffe of wind;<br>
And snatching her soone vp, ere well she knew,<br>
Ran with her fast away vnto his mew,<br>
Crying for helpe aloud.  But when as ny<br>
He came vnto his caue, and there did vew<br>
The armed knights stopping his passage by,<br>
He threw his burden downe, and fast away did fly.<p>

But <i>Artegall</i> him after did pursew,<br>
The whiles the Prince there kept the entrance still:<br>
Vp to the rocke he ran, and thereon flew<br>
Like a wyld Gote, leaping from hill to hill,<br>
And dauncing on the craggy cliffes at will;<br>
That deadly daunger seem'd in all mens sight,<br>
To tempt such steps, where footing was so ill:<br>
Ne ought auayled for the armed knight,<br>
To thinke to follow him, that was so swift and light.<p>

Which when he saw, his yron man he sent,<br>
To follow him; for he was swift in chace.<br>
He him pursewd, where euer that he went,<br>
Both ouer rockes, and hilles, and euery place,<br>
Where so he fled, he followd him apace:<br>
So that he shortly forst him to forsake<br>
The hight, and downe descend vnto the base.<br>
There he him courst a fresh, and soone did make<br>
To leaue his proper forme, and other shape to take.<p>

Into a Foxe himselfe he first did tourne;<br>
But he him hunted like a Foxe full fast:<br>
Then to a bush himselfe he did transforme,<br>
But he the bush did beat, till that at last<br>
Into a bird it chaung'd, and from him past,<br>
Flying from tree to tree, from wand to wand:<br>
But he then stones at it so long did cast,<br>
That like a stone it fell vpon the land,<br>
But he then tooke it vp, and held fast in his hand.<p>

So he it brought with him vnto the knights,<br>
And to his Lord Sir <i>Artegall</i> it lent,<br>
Warning him hold it fast, for feare of slights.<br>
Who whilest in hand it gryping hard he hent,<br>
Into a Hedgehogge all vnwares it went,<br>
And prickt him so, that he away it threw.<br>
Then gan it runne away incontinent,<br>
Being returned to his former hew:<br>
But <i>Talus</i> soone him ouertooke, and backward drew.<p>

But when as he would to a snake againe<br>
Haue turn'd himselfe, he with his yron flayle<br>
Gan driue at him, with so huge might and maine,<br>
That all his bones, as small as sandy grayle<br>
He broke, and did his bowels disentrayle;<br>
Crying in vaine for helpe, when helpe was past.<br>
So did deceipt the selfe deceiuer fayle,<br>
There they him left a carrion outcast;<br>
For beasts and foules to feede vpon for their repast.<p>

Thence forth they passed with that gentle Mayd,<br>
To see her Ladie, as they did agree.<br>
To which when she approched, thus she sayd;<br>
Loe now, right noble knights, arriu'd ye bee<br>
Nigh to the place, which ye desir'd to see:<br>
There shall ye see my souerayne Lady Queene<br>
Most sacred wight, most debonayre and free,<br>
That euer yet vpon this earth was seene,<br>
Or that with Diademe hath euer crowned beene.<p>

The gentle knights reioyced much to heare<br>
The prayses of that Prince so manifold:<br>
And passing litle further, commen were,<br>
Where they a stately pallace did behold,<br>
Of pompous show, much more then she had told;<br>
With many towres, and tarras mounted hye,<br>
And all their tops bright glistering with gold,<br>
That seemed to outshine the dimmed skye,<br>
And with their brightnesse daz'd the straunge beholders eye.<p>

There they alighting, by that Damzell were<br>
Directed in, and shewed all the sight:<br>
Whose porch, that most magnificke did appeare,<br>
Stood open wyde to all men day and night;<br>
Yet warded well by one of mickle might,<br>
That sate thereby, with gyantlike resemblance,<br>
To keepe out guyle, and malice, and despight,<br>
That vnder shew oftimes of fayned semblance,<br>
Are wont in Princes courts to worke great scath and hindrance.<p>

His name was <i>Awe</i>; by whom they passing in<br>
Went vp the hall, that was a large wyde roome,<br>
All full of people making troublous din,<br>
And wondrous noyse, as if that there were some,<br>
Which vnto them was dealing righteous doome.<br>
By whom they passing, through the thickest preasse,<br>
The marshall of the hall to them did come;<br>
His name hight <i>Order</i>, who commaunding peace,<br>
Them guyded through the throng, that did their clamors ceasse.<p>

They ceast their clamors vpon them to gaze;<br>
Whom seeing all in armour bright as day,<br>
Straunge there to see, it did them much amaze,<br>
And with vnwonted terror halfe affray,<br>
For neuer saw they there the like array.<br>
Ne euer was the name of warre there spoken,<br>
But ioyous peace and quietnesse alway,<br>
Dealing iust iudgements, that mote not be broken<br>
For any brybes, or threates of any to be wroken.<p>

There as they entred at the Scriene, they saw<br>
Some one, whose tongue was for his trespasse vyle<br>
Nayld to a post, adiudged so by law:<br>
For that therewith he falsely did reuyle,<br>
And foule blaspheme that Queene for forged guyle,<br>
Both with bold speaches, which he blazed had,<br>
And with lewd poems, which he did compyle;<br>
For the bold title of a Poet bad<br>
He on himselfe had ta'en, and rayling rymes had sprad.<p>

Thus there he stood, whylest high ouer his head,<br>
There written was the purport of his sin,<br>
In cyphers strange, that few could rightly read,<br>
BON FONT: but <i>bon</i> that once had written bin,<br>
Was raced out, and <i>Mal</i> was now put in.<br>
So now <i>Malfont</i> was plainely to be red;<br>
Eyther for th'euill, which he did therein,<br>
Or that he likened was to a welhed<br>
Of euill words, and wicked sclaunders by him shed.<p>

They passing by, were guyded by degree<br>
Vnto the presence of that gratious Queene:<br>
Who sate on high, that she might all men see,<br>
And might of all men royally be seene:<br>
Vpon a throne of gold full bright and sheene,<br>
Adorned all with gemmes of endlesse price,<br>
As either might for wealth haue gotten bene,<br>
Or could be fram'd by workmans rare deuice;<br>
And all embost with Lyons and with Flourdelice.<p>

All ouer her a cloth of state was spred,<br>
Not of rich tissew, nor of cloth of gold,<br>
Nor of ought else, that may be richest red,<br>
But like a cloud, as likest may be told,<br>
That her brode spreading wings did wyde vnfold;<br>
Whose skirts were bordred with bright sunny beams,<br>
Glistring like gold, amongst the plights enrold,<br>
And here and there shooting forth siluer streames,<br>
Mongst which crept litle Angels through the glittering gleames.<p>

Seemed those litle Angels did vphold<br>
The cloth of state, and on their purpled wings<br>
Did beare the pendants, through their nimblesse bold:<br>
Besides a thousand more of such, as sings<br>
Hymnes to high God, and carols heauenly things,<br>
Encompassed the throne, on which she sate:<br>
She Angel-like, the heyre of ancient kings<br>
And mightie Conquerors, in royall state,<br>
Whylest kings and kesars at her feet did them prostrate.<p>

Thus she did sit in souerayne Maiestie,<br>
Holding a Scepter in her royall hand,<br>
The sacred pledge of peace and clemencie,<br>
With which high God had blest her happie land,<br>
Maugre so many foes, which did withstand.<br>
But at her feet her sword was likewise layde,<br>
Whose long rest rusted the bright steely brand;<br>
Yet when as foes enforst, or friends sought ayde,<br>
She could it sternely draw, that all the world dismayde.<p>

And round about, before her feet there sate<br>
A beuie of faire Virgins clad in white,<br>
That goodly seem'd t'adorne her royall state,<br>
All louely daughters of high <i>Ioue</i>, that hight,<br>
<i>Litae</i>, by him begot in loues delight,<br>
Vpon the righteous <i>Themis</i>: those they say<br>
Vpon <i>Ioues</i> iudgement seat wayt day and night,<br>
And when in wrath he threats the worlds decay,<br>
They doe his anger calme, and cruell vengeance stay.<p>

They also doe by his diuine permission<br>
Vpon the thrones of mortall Princes tend,<br>
And often treat for pardon and remission<br>
To suppliants, through frayltie which offend.<br>
Those did vpon <i>Mercillaes</i> throne attend:<br>
Iust <i>Dice</i>, wise <i>Eunomie</i>, myld <i>Eirene</i>,<br>
And them amongst, her glorie to commend,<br>
Sate goodly <i>Temperance</i> in garments clene,<br>
And sacred <i>Reuerence</i>, yborne of heauenly strene,<p>

Thus did she sit in royall rich estate,<br>
Admyr'd of many, honoured of all,<br>
Whylest vnderneath her feete, there as she sate,<br>
An huge great Lyon lay, that mote appall<br>
An hardie courage, like captiued thrall,<br>
With a strong yron chaine and coller bound,<br>
That once he could not moue, nor quich at all;<br>
Yet did he murmure with rebellious sound,<br>
And softly royne, when saluage choler gan redound.<p>

So sitting high in dreaded souerayntie,<br>
Those two strange knights were to her presence brought;<br>
Who bowing low before her Maiestie,<br>
Did to her myld obeysance, as they ought,<br>
And meekest boone, that they imagine mought.<br>
To whom she eke inclyning her withall,<br>
As a faire stoupe of her high soaring thought,<br>
A chearefull countenance on them let fall,<br>
Yet tempred with some maiestie imperiall.<p>

As the bright sunne, what time his fierie teme<br>
Towards the westerne brim begins to draw,<br>
Gins to abate the brightnesse of his beme,<br>
And feruour of his flames somewhat adaw:<br>
So did this mightie Ladie, when she saw<br>
Those two strange knights such homage to her make,<br>
Bate somewhat of that Maiestie and awe,<br>
That whylome wont to doe so many quake,<br>
And with more myld aspect those two to entertake.<p>

Now at that instant, as occasion fell,<br>
When these two stranger knights arriu'd in place,<br>
She was about affaires of common wele,<br>
Dealing of Iustice with indifferent grace,<br>
And hearing pleas of people meane and base.<br>
Mongst which as then, there was for to be heard<br>
The tryall of a great and weightie case,<br>
Which on both sides was then debating hard:<br>
But at the sight of these, those were a while debard.<p>

But after all her princely entertayne,<br>
To th'hearing of that former cause in hand,<br>
Her selfe eftsoones she gan conuert againe;<br>
Which that those knights likewise mote vnderstand,<br>
And witnesse forth aright in forrain land,<br>
Taking them vp vnto her stately throne,<br>
Where they mote heare the matter throughly scand<br>
On either part, she placed th'one on th'one,<br>
The other on the other side, and neare them none.<p>

Then was there brought, as prisoner to the barre,<br>
A Ladie of great countenance and place,<br>
But that she it with foule abuse did marre;<br>
Yet did appeare rare beautie in her face,<br>
But blotted with condition vile and base,<br>
That all her other honour did obscure,<br>
And titles of nobilitie deface:<br>
Yet in that wretched semblant, she did sure<br>
The peoples great compassion vnto her allure.<p>

Then vp arose a person of deepe reach,<br>
And rare in-sight, hard matters to reuele;<br>
That well could charme his tongue, and time his speach<br>
To all assayes; his name was called <i>Zele</i>:<br>
He gan that Ladie strongly to appele<br>
Of many haynous crymes, by her enured,<br>
And with sharpe reasons rang her such a pele,<br>
That those, whom she to pitie had allured,<br>
He now t'abhorre and loath her person had procured.<p>

First gan he tell, how this that seem'd so faire<br>
And royally arayd, <i>Duessa</i> hight,<br>
That false <i>Duessa</i>, which had wrought great care,<br>
And mickle mischiefe vnto many a knight,<br>
By her beguyled, and confounded quight:<br>
But not for those she now in question came,<br>
Though also those mote question'd be aright,<br>
But for vyld treasons, and outrageous shame,<br>
Which she against the dred <i>Mercilla</i> oft did frame.<p>

For she whylome (as ye mote yet right well<br>
Remember) had her counsels false conspyred,<br>
With faithlesse <i>Blandamour</i> and <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
(Both two her paramours, both by her hyred,<br>
And both with hope of shadowes vaine inspyred.)<br>
And with them practiz'd, how for to depryue<br>
<i>Mercilla</i> of her crowne, by her aspyred,<br>
That she might it vnto her selfe deryue,<br>
And tryumph in their blood, whom she to death did dryue.<p>

But through high heauens grace, which fauour not<br>
The wicked driftes of trayterous desynes,<br>
Gainst loiall Princes, all this cursed plot,<br>
Ere proofe it tooke, discouered was betymes,<br>
And th'actours won the meede meet for their crymes.<br>
Such be the meede of all, that by such mene<br>
Vnto the type of kingdomes title clymes.<br>
But false <i>Duessa</i> now vntitled Queene,<br>
Was brought to her sad doome, as here was to be seene.<p>

Strongly did <i>Zele</i> her haynous fact enforce,<br>
And many other crimes of foule defame<br>
Against her brought, to banish all remorse,<br>
And aggrauate the horror of her blame.<br>
And with him to make part against her, came<br>
Many graue persons, that against her pled;<br>
First was a sage old Syre, that had to name<br>
The <i>Kingdomes care</i>, with a white siluer hed,<br>
That many high regards and reasons gainst her red.<p>

Then gan <i>Authority</i> her to appose<br>
With peremptorie powre, that made all mute;<br>
And then the law of <i>Nations</i> gainst her rose,<br>
And reasons brought, that no man could refute;<br>
Next gan <i>Religion</i> gainst her to impute<br>
High Gods beheast, and powre of holy lawes;<br>
Then gan the Peoples cry and Commons sute,<br>
Importune care of their owne publicke cause;<br>
And lastly <i>Iustice</i> charged her with breach of lawes.<p>

But then for her, on the contrarie part,<br>
Rose many aduocates for her to plead:<br>
First there came <i>Pittie</i>, with full tender hart,<br>
And with her ioyn'd <i>Regard</i> of womanhead;<br>
And then came <i>Daunger</i> threatning hidden dread,<br>
And high alliance vnto forren powre;<br>
Then came <i>Nobilitie</i> of birth, that bread<br>
Great ruth through her misfortunes tragicke stowre;<br>
And lastly <i>Griefe</i> did plead, and many teares forth powre.<p>

With the neare touch whereof in tender hart<br>
The Briton Prince was sore empassionate,<br>
And woxe inclined much vnto her part,<br>
Through the sad terror of so dreadfull fate,<br>
And wretched ruine of so high estate,<br>
That for great ruth his courage gan relent.<br>
Which when as <i>Zele</i> perceiued to abate,<br>
He gan his earnest feruour to augment,<br>
And many fearefull obiects to them to present.<p>

He gan t'efforce the euidence anew,<br>
And new accusements to produce in place:<br>
He brought forth that old hag of hellish hew,<br>
The cursed <i>Ate</i>, brought her face to face,<br>
Who priuie was, and partie in the case:<br>
She, glad of spoyle and ruinous decay,<br>
Did her appeach, and to her more disgrace,<br>
The plot of all her practise did display,<br>
And all her traynes, and all her treasons forth did lay.<p>

Then brought he forth, with griesly grim aspect,<br>
Abhorred <i>Murder</i>, who with bloudie knyfe<br>
Yet dropping fresh in hand did her detect,<br>
And there with guiltie bloudshed charged ryfe:<br>
Then brought he forth <i>Sedition</i>, breeding stryfe<br>
In troublous wits, and mutinous vprore:<br>
Then brought he forth <i>Incontinence</i> of lyfe,<br>
Euen foule <i>Adulterie</i> her face before,<br>
And lewd <i>Impietie</i>, that her accused sore.<p>

All which when as the Prince had heard and seene,<br>
His former fancies ruth he gan repent,<br>
And from her partie eftsoones was drawen cleene.<br>
But <i>Artegall</i> with constant firme intent,<br>
For zeale of Iustice was against her bent.<br>
So was she guiltie deemed of them all.<br>
Then <i>Zele</i> began to vrge her punishment,<br>
And to their Queene for iudgement loudly call,<br>
Vnto <i>Mercilla</i> myld for Iustice gainst the thrall.<p>

But she, whose Princely breast was touched nere<br>
With piteous ruth of her so wretched plight,<br>
Though plaine she saw by all, that she did heare,<br>
That she of death was guiltie found by right,<br>
Yet would not let iust vengeance on her light;<br>
But rather let in stead thereof to fall<br>
Few perling drops from her faire lampes of light;<br>
The which she couering with her purple pall<br>
Would haue the passion hid, and vp arose withall.<p>
