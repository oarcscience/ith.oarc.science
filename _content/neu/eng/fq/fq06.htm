<p> 
<blockquote> 
 
 
<i>To sinfull house of Pride, Duessa<br>
guides the faithfull knight,<br> 
Where brothers death to wreak Sansioy<br> 
doth chalenge him to fight. </i><p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>
<blockquote>     
YOung knight, what euer that dost armes 
professe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And through long labours huntest after fame,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beware of fraud, beware of ficklenesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In choice, and change of thy deare loued Dame,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Least thou of her beleeue too lightly blame,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And rash misweening doe thy hart remoue:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For vnto knight there is no greater shame,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then lightnesse and inconstancie in loue;<br>
That doth this <i>Redcrosse</i> knights ensample plainly proue.<p>
 
Who after that he had faire <i>Vna</i> lorne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through light misdeeming of her loialtie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And false <i>Duessa</i> in her sted had borne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Called <i>Fidess'</i>, and so supposd to bee;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Long with her traueild, till at last they see<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A goodly building, brauely garnished,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The house of mightie Prince it seemd to bee:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And towards it a broad high way that led,<br>
All bare through peoples feet, which thither traueiled.<p>
 
Great troupes of people traueild thitherward<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both day and night, of each degree and place,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But few returned, hauing scaped hard,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With balefull beggerie, or foule disgrace,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which euer after in most wretched case,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like loathsome lazars, by the hedges lay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thither <i>Duessa</i> bad him bend his pace:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For she is wearie of the toilesome way,<br>
And also nigh consumed is the lingring day.<p>
 
A stately Pallace built of squared bricke,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which cunningly was without morter laid,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose wals were high, but nothing strong, nor thick,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And golden foile all ouer them displaid,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That purest skye with brightnesse they dismaid:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
High lifted vp were many loftie towres,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And goodly galleries farre ouer laid,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Full of faire windowes, and delightfull bowres;<br>
And on the top a Diall told the timely howres.<p>
 
It was a goodly heape for to behould,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And spake the praises of the workmans wit;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But full great pittie, that so faire a mould<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did on so weake foundation euer sit:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For on a sandie hill, that still did flit,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And fall away, it mounted was full hie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That euery breath of heauen shaked it:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all the hinder parts, that few could spie,<br>
Were ruinous and old, but painted cunningly.<p>
 
Arriued there they passed in forth right;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For still to all the gates stood open wide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet charge of them was to a Porter hight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cald <i>Maluen&uacute;</i>, who entrance none denide:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thence to the hall, which was on euery side<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With rich array and costly arras dight:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Infinite sorts of people did abide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
There waiting long, to win the wished sight<br>
Of her, that was the Lady of that Pallace bright.<p>
 
By them they passe, all gazing on them round,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And to the Presence mount; whose glorious vew<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Their frayle amazed senses did confound:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In liuing Princes court none euer knew<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such endlesse richesse, and so sumptuous shew;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne <i>Persia</i> selfe, the nourse of pompous pride<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like euer saw. And there a noble crew<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of Lordes and Ladies stood on euery side<br>
Which with their presence faire, the place much beautifide.<p>
 
High aboue all a cloth of State was spred,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And a rich throne, as bright as sunny day,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
On which there sate most braue embellished<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With royall robes and gorgeous array,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A mayden Queene, that shone as <i>Titans</i> ray,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In glistring gold, and peerelesse pretious stone:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet her bright blazing beautie did assay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To dim the brightnesse of her glorious throne,<br>
As enuying her selfe, that too exceeding shone.<p>
 
Exceeding shone, like <i>Phoebus</i> fairest childe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That did presume his fathers firie wayne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And flaming mouthes of steedes vnwonted wilde<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through highest heauen with weaker hand to rayne;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Proud of such glory and aduancement vaine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
While flashing beames do daze his feeble eyen,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He leaues the welkin way most beaten plaine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And rapt with whirling wheeles, inflames the skyen,<br>
With fire not made to burne, but fairely for to shyne.<p>
 
So proud she shyned in her Princely state,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Looking to heauen; for earth she did disdayne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sitting high; for lowly she did hate:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lo vnderneath her scornefull feete, was layne<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A dreadfull Dragon with an hideous trayne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in her hand she held a mirrhour bright,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wherein her face she often vewed fayne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in her selfe-lou'd semblance tooke delight;<br>
For she was wondrous faire, as any liuing wight.<p>
 
Of griesly <i>Pluto</i> she the daughter was,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sad <i>Proserpina</i> the Queene of hell;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet did she thinke her pearelesse wroth to pas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That parentage, with pride so did she swell,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And thundring <i>Ioue</i>, that high in heauen doth dwell,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And wield the world, she claymed for her syre,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or if that any else did <i>Ioue</i> excell:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For to the highest she did still aspyre,<br>
Or if ought higher were then that, did it desyre.<p>
 
And proud <i>Lucifera</i> men did her call,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That made her selfe a Queene, and crownd to be,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet rightfull kingdome she had none at all,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne heritage of natiue soueraintie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But did vsurpe with wrong and tyrannie<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon the scepter, which she now did hold:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne ruld her Realmes with lawes, but pollicie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And strong aduizement of six wisards old,<br>
That with their counsels bad her kingdome did vphold.<p>
 
Soone as the Elfing knight in presence came,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And false <i>Duessa</i> seeming Lady faire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A gentle Husher, <i>Vanitie</i> by name<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Made rowme, and passage for them did prepaire:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So goodly brought them to the lowest staire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of her high throne, where they on humble knee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Making obeyssance, did the cause declare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why they were come, her royall state to see,<br>
To proue the wide report of her great Maiestee.<p>
 
With loftie eyes, halfe loth to looke so low,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She thanked them in her disdainefull wise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne other grace vouchsafed them to show<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of Princesse worthy, scarse them bad arise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her Lordes and Ladies all this while deuise<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Themselues to setten forth to straungers sight:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some frounce their curled haire in courtly guise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some prancke their ruffes, and others trimly dight<br>
Their gay attire: each others greater pride does spight.<p>
 
Goodly they all that knight do entertaine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Right glad with him to haue increast their crew:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But to <i>Duess'</i> each one himselfe did paine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
All kindnesse and faire courtesie to shew;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For in that court whylome her well they knew:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet the stout Faerie mongst the middest crowd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thought all their glorie vaine in knightly vew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And that great Princesse too exceeding prowd,<br>
That to strange knight no better countenance allowd.<p>
 
Suddein vpriseth from her stately place<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The royall Dame, and for her coche doth call:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
All hurtlen forth, and she with Princely pace,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As faire <i>Aurora</i> in her purple pall,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Out of the East the dawning day doth call:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So forth she comes: her brightnesse brode doth blaze;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The heapes of people thronging in the hall,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do ride each other, vpon her to gaze:<br>
Her glorious glitterand light doth all mens eyes amaze.<p>
 
So forth she comes, and to her coche does clyme,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Adorned all with gold, and girlonds gay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That seemd as fresh as <i>Flora</i> in her prime,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And stroue to match, in royall rich array,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Great <i>Iunoes</i> golden chaire, the which they say<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Gods stand gazing on, when she does ride<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To <i>Ioues</i> high house through heauens bras-paued way<br&nbsp;&nbsp;>
Drawne of faire Pecocks, that excell in pride,<br>
And full of <i>Argus</i> eyes their tailes dispredden wide.<p>
 
But this was drawne of six vnequall beasts,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
On which her six sage Counsellours did ryde,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Taught to obay their bestiall beheasts,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With like conditions to their kinds applyde:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of which the first, that all the rest did guyde,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was sluggish <i>Idlenesse</i> the nourse of sin;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon a slouthfull Asse he chose to ryde,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Arayd in habit blacke, and amis thin,<br>
Like to an holy Monck, the seruice to begin.<p>
 
And in his hand his Portesse still he bare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That much was worne, but therein little red,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For of deuotion he had little care,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still drownd in sleepe, and most of his dayes ded;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scarse could he once vphold his heauie hed,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To looken, whether it were night or day:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
May seeme the wayne was very euill led,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
When such an one had guiding of the way,<br>
That knew not, whether right he went, or else astray.<p>
 
From worldy cares himselfe he did esloyne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And greatly shunned manly exercise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From euery worke he chalenged essoyne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For contemplation sake: yet otherwise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His life he led in lawlesse riotise;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By which he grew to grieuous malady;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For in his lustlesse limbs through euill guise<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A shaking feuer raignd continually:<br>
Such one was <i>Idlenesse</i>, first of this company.<p>
 
And by his side rode loathsome <i>Gluttony</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Deformed creature, on a filthie swyne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His belly was vp-blowne with luxury,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And like a Crane his necke was long and fyne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With which he swallowd vp excessiue feast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For want whereof poore people oft did pyne;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all the way, most like a brutish beast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He spued vp his gorge, that all did him deteast.<p>
 
In greene vine leaues he was right fitly clad;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For other clothes he could not weare for heat,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And on his head an yuie girland had,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From vnder which fast trickled downe the sweat:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still as he rode, he somewhat still did eat,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in his hand did beare a bouzing can,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of which he supt so oft, that on his seat<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His dronken corse he scarse vpholden can,<br>
In shape and life more like a monster, then a man.<p>
 
Vnfit he was for any worldy thing,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And eke vnhable once to stirre or go,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not meet to be of counsell to a king,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose mind in meat and drinke was drowned so,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That from his friend he seldome knew his fo:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Full of diseases was his carcas blew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And a dry dropsie through his flesh did flow:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which by misdiet daily greater grew:<br>
Such one was <i>Gluttony</i>, the second of that crew.<p>
 
And next to him rode lustfull <i>Lechery</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon a bearded Goat, whose rugged haire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And whally eyes (the signe of gelosy,)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was like the person selfe, whom he did beare:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who rough, and blacke, and filthy did appeare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnseemely man to please faire Ladies eye;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet he of Ladies oft was loued deare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
When fairer faces were bid standen by:<br>
O who does know the bent of womens fantasy?<p>
 
In a greene gowne he clothed was full faire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which vnderneath did hide his filthinesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in his hand a burning hart he bare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Full of vaine follies, and new fanglenesse:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For he was false, and fraught with ficklenesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And learned had to loue with secret lookes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And well could daunce, and sing with ruefulnesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And fortunes tell, and read in louing bookes,<br>
And thousand other wayes, to bait his fleshly hookes.<p>
 
Inconstant man, that loued all he saw,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And lusted after all, that he did loue,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne would his looser life be tide to law,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But ioyd weake wemens hearts to tempt, and proue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
If from their loyall loues he might then moue;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which lewdnesse fild him with reprochfull paine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of that fowle euill, which all men reproue,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That rots the marrow, and consumes the braine:<br>
Such one was <i>Lecherie</i>, the third of all this traine.<p>
 
And greedy <i>Auarice</i> by him did ride,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon a Camell loaden all with gold;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two iron coffers hong on either side,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With precious mettall full, as they might hold,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in his lap an heape of coine he told;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For of his wicked pelfe his God he made,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And vnto hell him selfe for money sold;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Accursed vsurie was all his trade,<br>
And right and wrong ylike in equall ballaunce waide.<p>
 
His life was nigh vnto deaths doore yplast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And thred-bare cote, and cobled shoes he ware,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne scarse good morsell all his life did tast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But both from backe and belly still did spare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To fill his bags, and richesse to compare;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet chylde ne kinsman liuing had he none<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To leaue them to; but thorough daily care<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To get, and nightly feare to lose his owne,<br>
He led a wretched life vnto him selfe vnknowne.<p>
 
Most wretched wight, whom nothing might suffise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose greedy lust did lacke in greatest store,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose need had end, but no end couetise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whose wealth was want, whose pl&#7869;ty made him pore,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who had enough, yet wished euer more;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A vile disease, and eke in foote and hand<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A grieuous gout tormented him full sore,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That well he could not touch, nor go, nor stand:<br>
Such one was <i>Auarice</i>, the fourth of this faire band.<p>
 
And next to him malicious <i>Enuie</i> rode,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon a rauenous wolfe, and still did chaw<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Betweene his cankred teeth a venemous tode,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That all the poison ran about his chaw;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But inwardly he chawed his owne maw<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
At neighbours wealth, that made him euer sad;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For death it was, when any good he saw,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And wept, that cause of weeping none he had,<br>
But when he heard of harme, he wexed wondrous glad.<p>
 
All in a kirtle of discolourd say<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He clothed was, ypainted full of eyes;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in his bosome secretly there lay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
An hatefull Snake, the which his taile vptyes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In many folds, and mortall sting implyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still as he rode, he gnasht his teeth, to see<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Those heapes of gold with griple Couetyse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And grudged at the great felicitie<br>
Of proud <i>Lucifera</i>, and his owne companie.<p>
 
He hated all good workes and vertuous deeds,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And him no lesse, that any like did vse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His almes for want of faith he doth accuse;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So euery good to bad he doth abuse:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And eke the verse of famous Poets witt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He does backebite, and spightfull poison spues<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From leprous mouth on all, that euer writt:<br>
Such one vile <i>Enuie</i> was, that fift in row did sitt.<p>
 
And him beside rides fierce reuenging <i>VVrath</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon a Lion, loth for to be led;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in his hand a burning brond he hath,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The which he brandisheth about his hed;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His eyes did hurle forth sparkles fiery red,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And stared sterne on all, that him beheld,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As ashes pale of hew and seeming ded;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And on his dagger still his hand he held,<br>
Trembling through hasty rage, wh&#7869; choler in him sweld.<p>
 
His ruffin raiment all was staind with blood,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which he had spilt, and all to rags yrent,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through vnaduized rashnesse woxen wood;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For of his hands he had no gouernement,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne car'd for bloud in his auengement:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But when the furious fit was ouerpast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His cruell facts he often would repent;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet wilfull man he neuer would forecast,<br>
How many mischieues should ensue his heedlesse hast.<p>
 
Full many mischiefes follow cruell <i>VVrath</i>;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Abhorred bloudshed, and tumultuous strife,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnmanly murder, and vnthrifty scath,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bitter despight, with rancours rusty knife,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And fretting griefe the enemy of life;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
All these, and many euils moe haunt ire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The swelling Splene, and Frenzy raging rife,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The shaking Palsey, and Saint <i>Fraunces</i> fire:<br>
Such one was <i>VVrath</i>, the last of this vngodly tire.<p>
 
And after all, vpon the wagon beame<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Rode <i>Sathan</i>, with a smarting whip in hand,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With which he forward lasht the laesie teme,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So oft as <i>Slowth</i> still in the mire did stand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Huge routs of people did about them band,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Showting for ioy, and still before their way<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A foggy mist had couered all the land;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And vnderneath their feet, all scattered lay<br>
Dead sculs &amp; bones of men, whose life had gone astray.<p>
 
So forth they marchen in this goodly sort,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To take the solace of the open aire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in fresh flowring fields themselues to sport;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Emongst the rest rode that false Lady faire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fowle <i>Duessa</i>, next vnto the chaire<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of proud <i>Lucifer'</i>, as one of the traine:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But that good knight would not so nigh repaire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Him selfe estraunging from their ioyaunce vaine,<br>
Whose fellowship seemd far vnfit for warlike swaine.<p>
 
So hauing solaced themselues a space<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With pleasaunce of the breathing fields yfed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
They backe returned to the Princely Place;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whereas an errant knight in armes ycled,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And heathnish shield, wherein with letters red<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was writ <i>Sans ioy</i>, they new arriued find:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Enflam'd with fury and fiers hardy-hed,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He seemd in hart to harbour thoughts vnkind,<br>
And nourish bloudy vengeaunce in his bitter mind.<p>
 
Who when the shamed shield of slaine <i>Sans foy</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He spide with that same Faery champions page,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Bewraying him, that did of late destroy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His eldest brother, burning all with rage<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He to him leapt, and that same enuious gage<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of victors glory from him snatcht away:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But th'Elfin knight, which ought that warlike wage,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray,<br>
And him rencountring fierce, reskewd the noble pray.<p>
 
Therewith they gan to hurtlen greedily,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Redoubted battaile ready to darrayne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And clash their shields, and shake their swords on hy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That with their sturre they troubled all the traine;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Till that great Queene vpon eternall paine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of high displeasure, that ensewen might,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Commaunded them their fury to refraine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And if that either to that shield had right,<br>
In equall lists they should the morrow next it fight.<p>
 
Ah dearest Dame, (quoth then the Paynim bold,)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pardon the errour of enraged wight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whom great griefe made forget the raines to hold<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of reasons rule, to see this recreant knight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
No knight, but treachour full of false despight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And shamefull treason, who through guile hath slayn<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The prowest knight, that euer field did fight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Euen stout <i>Sans foy</i> (O who can then refrayn?)<br>
Whose shield he beares renuerst, the more to heape disdayn.<p>
 
And to augment the glorie of his guile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His dearest loue the faire <i>Fidessa</i> loe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is there possessed of the traytour vile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who reapes the haruest sowen by his foe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sowen in bloudy field, and bought with woe:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That brothers hand shall dearely well requight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So be, &ocirc; Queene, you equall fauour showe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Him litle answerd th'angry Elfin knight;<br>
He neuer meant with words, but swords to plead his right.<p>
 
But threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His cause in combat the next day to try:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So been they parted both, with harts on edge,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To be aueng'd each on his enimy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That night they pas in ioy and iollity,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Feasting and courting both in bowre and hall;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For Steward was excessiue <i>Gluttonie</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That of his plenty poured forth to all:<br>
Which doen, the Chamberlain <i>Slowth</i> did to rest them call.<p>
 
Now whenas darkesome night had all displayd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her coleblacke curtein ouer brightest skye,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The warlike youthes on dayntie couches layd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did chace away sweet sleepe from sluggish eye,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To muse on meanes of hoped victory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But whenas <i>Morpheus</i> had with leaden mace<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Arrested all that courtly company,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vp-rose <i>Duessa</i> from her resting place,<br>
And to the Paynims lodging comes with silent pace.<p>
 
Whom broad awake she finds, in troublous fit,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forecasting, how his foe he might annoy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And him amoues with speaches seeming fit:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ah deare <i>Sans ioy</i>, next dearest to <i>Sans foy</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cause of my new griefe, cause of my new ioy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ioyous, to see his ymage in mine eye,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And greeu'd, to thinke how foe did him destroy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That was the flowre of grace and cheualrye;<br>
Lo his <i>Fidessa</i> to thy secret faith I flye.<p>
 
With gentle wordes he can her fairely greet,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And bad say on the secret of her hart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then sighing soft, I learne that litle sweet<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oft tempred is (quoth she) with muchell smart:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For since my brest was launcht with louely dart<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of deare <i>Sansfoy</i>, I neuer ioyed howre,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But in eternall woes my weaker hart<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Haue wasted, louing him with all my powre,<br>
And for his sake haue felt full many an heauie stowre.<p>
 
At last when perils all I weened past,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And hop'd to reape the crop of all my care,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Into new woes vnweeting I was cast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By this false faytor, who vnworthy ware<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His worthy shield, whom he with guilefull snare<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Entrapped slew, and brought to shamefull graue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Me silly maid away with him he bare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And euer since hath kept in darksome caue,<br>
For that I would not yeeld, that to <i>Sans-foy</i> I gaue.<p>
 
But since faire Sunne hath sperst that lowring clowd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And to my loathed life now shewes some light,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnder your beames I will me safely shrowd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From dreaded storme of his disdainfull spight:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To you th'inheritance belongs by right<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of brothers prayse, to you eke longs his loue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let not his loue, let not his restlesse spright<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Be vnreueng'd, that calles to you aboue<br>
From wandring <i>Stygian</i> shores, where it doth endlesse moue.<p>
 
Thereto said he, Faire Dame be nought dismaid<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For sorrowes past; their griefe is with them gone:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne yet of present perill be affraid;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For needlesse feare did neuer vantage none,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And helplesse hap it booteth not to mone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dead is <i>Sans-foy</i>, his vitall paines are past,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Though greeued ghost for vengeance deepe do grone:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He liues, that shall him pay his dewties last,<br>
And guiltie Elfin bloud shall sacrifice in hast.<p>
 
O but I feare the fickle freakes (quoth shee)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of fortune false, and oddes of armes in field.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why dame (quoth he) what oddes can euer bee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where both do fight alike, to win or yield?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yea but (quoth she) he beares a charmed shield,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And eke enchaunted armes, that none can perce,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ne none can wound the man, that does them wield.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Charmd or enchaunted (answerd he then ferce)<br>
I no whit reck, ne you the like need to reherce.<p>
 
But faire <i>Fidessa</i>, sithens fortunes guile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or enimies powre hath now captiued you,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Returne from whence ye came, and rest a while<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Till morrow next, that I the Elfe subdew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And with <i>Sans-foyes</i> dead dowry you endew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ay me, that is a double death (she said)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With proud foes sight my sorrow to renew:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where euer yet I be, my secrete aid<br>
Shall follow you. So passing forth she him obaid.<p>
