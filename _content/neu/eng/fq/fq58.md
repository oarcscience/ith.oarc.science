*Cant. VI.*

> *Talus brings newes to Britomart  
> of Artegals mishap,  
> She goes to seeke him, Dolon meetes  
> who seekes her to entrap.*

> S Ome men, I wote, will deeme in *Artegall*  
> Great weaknesse, and report of him much ill,  
> For yeelding so himselfe a wretched thrall,  
> To th'insolent commaund of womens will;  
> That all his former praise doth fowly spill.  
> But he the man, that say or doe so dare,  
> Be well aduiz'd, that he stand stedfast still:  
> For neuer yet was wight so well aware,  
> But he at first or last was trapt in womens snare.
>
> Yet in the streightnesse of that captiue state,  
> This gentle knight himselfe so well behaued,  
> That notwithstanding all the subtill bait,  
> With which those Amazons his loue still craued,  
> To his owne loue his loialtie he saued:  
> Whose character in th'Adamantine mould  
> Of his true hart so firmely was engraued,  
> That no new loues impression euer could  
> Bereaue it thence: such blot his honour blemish should.
>
> Yet his owne loue, the noble *Britomart*,  
> Scarse so conceiued in her iealous thought,  
> What time sad tydings of his balefull smart  
> In womans bondage, *Talus* to her brought;  
> Brought in vntimely houre, ere it was sought.  
> For after that the vtmost date, assynde  
> For his returne, she waited had for nought,  
> She gan to cast in her misdoubtfull mynde  
> A thousand feares, that loue-sicke fancies faine to fynde.
>
> Sometime she feared, least some hard mishap  
> Had him misfalne in his aduenturous quest;  
> Sometime least his false foe did him entrap  
> In traytrous traine, or had vnwares opprest:  
> But most she did her troubled mynd molest,  
> And secretly afflict with iealous feare,  
> Least some new loue had him from her possest;  
> Yet loth she was, since she no ill did heare,  
> To thinke of him so ill: yet could she not forbeare.
>
> One while she blam'd her selfe; another whyle  
> She him condemn'd, as trustlesse and vntrew:  
> And then, her griefe with errour to beguyle,  
> She fayn'd to count the time againe anew,  
> As if before she had not counted trew.  
> For houres but dayes; for weekes, that passed were,  
> She told but moneths, to make them seeme more few:  
> Yet when she reckned them, still drawing neare,  
> Each hour did seeme a moneth, & euery moneth a yeare.
>
> But when as yet she saw him not returne,  
> She thought to send some one to seeke him out;  
> But none she found so fit to serue that turne,  
> As her owne selfe, to ease her selfe of dout.  
> Now she deuiz'd amongst the warlike rout  
> Of errant Knights, to seeke her errant Knight;  
> And then againe resolu'd to hunt him out  
> Amongst loose Ladies, lapped in delight:  
> And then both Knights enuide, & Ladies eke did spight.
>
> One day, when as she long had sought for ease  
> In euery place, and euery place thought best,  
> Yet found no place, that could her liking please,  
> She to a window came, that opened West,  
> Towards which coast her loue his way addrest.  
> There looking forth, shee in her heart did find  
> Many vaine fancies, working her vnrest;  
> And sent her winged thoughts, more swift then wind,  
> To beare vnto her loue the message of her mind.
>
> There as she looked long, at last she spide  
> One comming towards her with hasty speede:  
> Well weend she then, ere him she plaine descride,  
> That it was one sent from her loue indeede.  
> Who when he nigh approcht, shee mote arede  
> That it was *Talus*, *Artegall* his groome;  
> Whereat her heart was fild with hope and drede;  
> Ne would she stay, till he in place could come,  
> But ran to meete him forth, to know his tidings somme.
>
> Euen in the dore him meeting, she begun;  
> And where is he thy Lord, and how far hence?  
> Declare at once; and hath he lost or wun?  
> The yron man, albe he wanted sence  
> And sorrowes feeling, yet with conscience  
> Of his ill newes, did inly chill and quake,  
> And stood still mute, as one in great suspence,  
> As if that by his silence he would make  
> Her rather reade his meaning, then him selfe it spake.
>
> Till she againe thus sayd; *Talus* be bold,  
> And tell what euer it be, good or bad,  
> That from thy tongue thy hearts intent doth hold.  
> To whom he thus at length. The tidings sad,  
> That I would hide, will needs, I see, be rad.  
> My Lord, your Loue, by hard mishap doth lie  
> In wretched bondage, wofully bestad.  
> Ay me (quoth she) what wicked destinie?  
> And is he vanquisht by his tyrant enemy?
>
> Not by that Tyrant, his intended foe;  
> But by a Tyrannesse (he then replide,)  
> That him captiued hath in haplesse woe.  
> Cease thou bad newes-man, badly doest thou hide  
> Thy maisters shame, in harlots bondage tide.  
> The rest my selfe too readily can spell.  
> With that in rage she turn'd from him aside,  
> Forcing in vaine the rest to her to tell,  
> And to her chamber went like solitary cell.
>
> There she began to make her monefull plaint  
> Against her Knight, for being so vntrew;  
> And him to touch with falshoods fowle attaint,  
> That all his other honour ouerthrew.  
> Oft did she blame her selfe, and often rew,  
> For yeelding to a straungers loue so light,  
> Whose life and manners straunge she neuer knew;  
> And euermore she did him sharpely twight  
> For breach of faith to her, which he had firmely plight.
>
> And then she in her wrathfull will did cast,  
> How to reuenge that blot of honour blent;  
> To fight with him, and goodly die her last:  
> And then againe she did her selfe torment,  
> Inflicting on her selfe his punishment.  
> A while she walkt, and chauft; a while she threw  
> Her selfe vppon her bed, and did lament:  
> Yet did she not lament with loude alew,  
> As women wont, but with deepe sighes, and singulfs few.
>
> Like as a wayward childe, whose sounder sleepe  
> Is broken with some fearefull dreames affright,  
> With froward will doth set him selfe to weepe;  
> Ne can be stild for all his nurses might,  
> But kicks, and squals, and shriekes for fell despight:  
> Now scratching her, and her loose locks misusing;  
> Now seeking darkenesse, and now seeking light;  
> Then crauing sucke, and then the sucke refusing.  
> Such was this Ladies fit, in her loues fond accusing.
>
> But when she had with such vnquiet fits  
> Her selfe there close afflicted long in vaine,  
> Yet found no easement in her troubled wits,  
> She vnto *Talus* forth return'd againe,  
> By change of place seeking to ease her paine;  
> And gan enquire of him, with mylder mood,  
> The certaine cause of *Artegals* detaine;  
> And what he did, and in what state he stood,  
> And whether he did woo, or whether he were woo'd.
>
> Ah wellaway (sayd then the yron man,)  
> That he is not the while in state to woo;  
> But lies in wretched thraldome, weake and wan,  
> Not by strong hand compelled thereunto,  
> But his owne doome, that none can now vndoo.  
> Sayd I not then (quoth shee) erwhile aright,  
> That this is things compacte betwixt you two,  
> Me to deceiue of faith vnto me plight,  
> Since that he was not forst, nor ouercome in fight?
>
> With that he gan at large to her dilate  
> The whole discourse of his captiuance sad,  
> In sort as ye haue heard the same of late.  
> All which when she with hard enduraunce had  
> Heard to the end, she was right sore bestad,  
> With sodaine stounds of wrath and griefe attone:  
> Ne would abide, till she had aunswere made,  
> But streight her selfe did dight, and armor don;  
> And mounting to her steede, bad *Talus* guide her on.
>
> So forth she rode vppon her ready way,  
> To seeke her Knight, as *Talus* her did guide:  
> Sadly she rode, and neuer word did say,  
> Nor good nor bad, ne euer lookt aside,  
> But still right downe, and in her thought did hide  
> The felnesse of her heart, right fully bent  
> To fierce auengement of that womans pride,  
> Which had her Lord in her base prison pent,  
> And so great honour with so fowle reproch had blent.
>
> So as she thus melancholicke did ride,  
> Chawing the cud of griefe and inward paine,  
> She chaunst to meete toward th'euen-tide  
> A Knight, that softly paced on the plaine,  
> As if him selfe to solace he were faine.  
> Well shot in yeares he seem'd, and rather bent  
> To peace, then needlesse trouble to constraine.  
> As well by view of that his vestiment,  
> As by his modest semblant, that no euill ment.
>
> He comming neare, gan gently her salute,  
> With curteous words, in the most comely wize;  
> Who though desirous rather to rest mute,  
> Then termes to entertaine of common guize,  
> Yet rather then she kindnesse would despize,  
> She would her selfe displease, so him requite.  
> Then gan the other further to deuize  
> Of things abrode, as next to hand did light,  
> And many things demaund, to which she answer'd light.
>
> For little lust had she to talke of ought,  
> Or ought to heare, that mote delightfull bee;  
> Her minde was whole possessed of one thought,  
> That gaue none other place. Which when as hee  
> By outward signes, (as well he might) did see,  
> He list no lenger to vse lothfull speach,  
> But her besought to take it well in gree,  
> Sith shady dampe had dimd the heauens reach,  
> To lodge with him that night, vnles good cause empeach.
>
> The Championesse, now seeing night at dore,  
> Was glad to yeeld vnto his good request:  
> And with him went without gaine-saying more.  
> Not farre away, but little wide by West,  
> His dwelling was, to which he him addrest;  
> Where soone arriuing they receiued were  
> In seemely wise, as them beseemed best:  
> For he their host them goodly well did cheare,  
> And talk't of pleasant things, the night away to weare.
>
> Thus passing th'euening well, till time of rest,  
> Then *Britomart* vnto a bowre was brought;  
> Where groomes awayted her to haue vndrest.  
> But she ne would vndressed be for ought,  
> Ne doffe her armes, though he her much besought.  
> For she had vow'd, she sayd, not to forgo  
> Those warlike weedes, till she reuenge had wrought  
> Of a late wrong vppon a mortall foe;  
> Which she would sure performe, betide her wele or wo.
>
> Which when their Host perceiu'd, right discontent  
> In minde he grew, for feare least by that art  
> He should his purpose misse, which close he ment:  
> Yet taking leaue of her, he did depart.  
> There all that night remained *Britomart*,  
> Restlesse, recomfortlesse, with heart deepe grieued,  
> Not suffering the least twinckling sleepe to start  
> Into her eye, which th'heart mote haue relieued,  
> But if the least appear'd, her eyes she streight reprieued.
>
> Ye guilty eyes (sayd she) the which with guyle  
> My heart at first betrayd, will ye betray  
> My life now to, for which a little whyle  
> Ye will not watch? false watches, wellaway,  
> I wote when ye did watch both night and day  
> Vnto your losse: and now needes will ye sleepe?  
> Now ye haue made my heart to wake alway,  
> Now will ye sleepe? ah wake, and rather weepe,  
> To thinke of your nights want, that should yee waking keepe.
>
> Thus did she watch, and weare the weary night  
> In waylfull plaints, that none was to appease;  
> Now walking soft, now sitting still vpright,  
> As sundry chaunge her seemed best to ease.  
> Ne lesse did *Talus* suffer sleepe to seaze  
> His eye-lids sad, but watcht continually,  
> Lying without her dore in great disease;  
> Like to a Spaniell wayting carefully  
> Least any should betray his Lady treacherously.
>
> What time the natiue Belman of the night,  
> The bird, that warned *Peter* of his fall,  
> First rings his siluer Bell t'each sleepy wight,  
> That should their mindes vp to deuotion call,  
> She heard a wondrous noise below the hall.  
> All sodainely the bed, where she should lie,  
> By a false trap was let adowne to fall  
> Into a lower roome, and by and by  
> The loft was raysd againe, that no man could it spie.
>
> With sight whereof she was dismayd right sore,  
> Perceiuing well the treason, which was ment:  
> Yet stirred not at all for doubt of more,  
> But kept her place with courage confident,  
> Wayting what would ensue of that euent.  
> It was not long, before she heard the sound  
> Of armed men, comming with close intent  
> Towards her chamber; at which dreadfull stound  
> She quickly caught her sword, & shield about her bound.
>
> With that there came vnto her chamber dore  
> Two Knights, all armed ready for to fight,  
> And after them full many other more,  
> A raskall rout, with weapons rudely dight.  
> Whom soone as *Talus* spide by glims of night,  
> He started vp, there where on ground he lay,  
> And in his hand his thresher ready keight.  
> They seeing that, let driue at him streight way,  
> And round about him preace in riotous aray.
>
> But soone as he began to lay about  
> With his rude yron flaile, they gan to flie,  
> Both armed Knights, and eke vnarmed rout:  
> Yet *Talus* after them apace did plie,  
> Where euer in the darke he could them spie;  
> That here and there like scattred sheepe they lay.  
> Then backe returning, where his Dame did lie,  
> He to her told the story of that fray,  
> And all that treason there intended did bewray.
>
> Wherewith though wondrous wroth, and inly burning,  
> To be auenged for so fowle a deede,  
> Yet being forst to abide the daies returning,  
> She there remain'd, but with right wary heede,  
> Least any more such practise should proceede.  
> Now mote ye know (that which to *Britomart*  
> Vnknowen was) whence all this did proceede,  
> And for what cause so great mischieuous smart  
> Was ment to her, that neuer euill ment in hart.
>
> The goodman of this house was *Dolon* hight,  
> A man of subtill wit and wicked minde,  
> That whilome in his youth had bene a Knight,  
> And armes had borne, but little good could finde,  
> And much lesse honour by that warlike kinde  
> Of life: for he was nothing valorous,  
> But with slie shiftes and wiles did vnderminde  
> All noble Knights, which were aduenturous,  
> And many brought to shame by treason treacherous.
>
> He had three sonnes, all three like fathers sonnes,  
> Like treacherous, like full of fraud and guile,  
> Of all that on this earthly compasse wonnes:  
> The eldest of the which was slaine erewhile  
> By *Artegall*, through his owne guilty wile;  
> His name was *Guizor*, whose vntimely fate  
> For to auenge, full many treasons vile  
> His father *Dolon* had deuiz'd of late  
> With these his wicked sons, and shewd his cankred hate.
>
> For sure he weend, that this his present guest  
> Was *Artegall*, by many tokens plaine;  
> But chiefly by that yron page he ghest,  
> Which still was wont with *Artegall* remaine;  
> And therefore ment him surely to haue slaine.  
> But by Gods grace, and her good heedinesse,  
> She was preserued from their traytrous traine.  
> Thus she all night wore out in watchfulnesse,  
> Ne suffred slothfull sleepe her eyelids to oppresse.
>
> The morrow next, so soone as dawning houre  
> Discouered had the light to liuing eye,  
> She forth yssew'd out of her loathed bowre,  
> With full intent t'auenge that villany,  
> On that vilde man, and all his family.  
> And comming down to seeke them, where they wond,  
> Nor sire, nor sonnes, nor any could she spie:  
> Each rowme she sought, but them all empty fond:  
> They all were fled for feare, but whether, nether kond.
>
> She saw it vaine to make there lenger stay,  
> But tooke her steede, and thereon mounting light,  
> Gan her addresse vnto her former way.  
> She had not rid the mountenance of a flight,  
> But that she saw there present in her sight,  
> Those two false brethren, on that perillous Bridge,  
> On which *Pollente* with *Artegall* did fight.  
> Streight was the passage like a ploughed ridge,  
> That if two met, the one mote needes fall ouer the lidge.
>
> There they did thinke them selues on her to wreake:  
> Who as she nigh vnto them drew, the one  
> These vile reproches gan vnto her speake;  
> Thou recreant false traytor, that with lone  
> Of armes has knighthood stolne, yet Knight art none,  
> No more shall now the darkenesse of the night  
> Defend thee from the vengeance of thy fone,  
> But with thy bloud thou shalt appease the spright  
> Of *Guizor*, by thee slaine, and murdred by thy slight.
>
> Strange were the words in *Britomartis* eare;  
> Yet stayd she not for them, but forward fared,  
> Till to the perillous Bridge she came, and there  
> *Talus* desir'd, that he might haue prepared  
> The way to her, and those two losels scared.  
> But she thereat was wroth, that for despight  
> The glauncing sparkles through her beuer glared,  
> And from her eies did flash out fiery light,  
> Like coles, that through a siluer Censer sparkle bright.
>
> She stayd not to aduise which way to take;  
> But putting spurres vnto her fiery beast,  
> Thorough the midst of them she way did make.  
> The one of them, which most her wrath increast,  
> Vppon her speare she bore before her breast,  
> Till to the Bridges further end she past,  
> Where falling downe, his challenge he releast:  
> The other ouer side the Bridge she cast  
> Into the riuer, where he drunke his deadly last.
>
> As when the flashing Leuin haps to light  
> Vppon two stubborne oakes, which stand so neare,  
> That way betwixt them none appeares in sight;  
> The Engin fiercely flying forth, doth teare  
> Th'one from the earth, & through the aire doth beare;  
> The other it with force doth ouerthrow,  
> Vppon one side, and from his rootes doth reare.  
> So did the Championesse those two there strow,  
> And to their sire their carcasses left to bestow.
