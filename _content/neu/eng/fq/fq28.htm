<blockquote>
<i>The Redcrosse knight to Britomart<br>
describeth Artegall: <br>
The wondrous myrrhour, by which she<br>
in loue with him did fall.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
H
Ere haue I cause, in men iust blame to find,<br>
That in their proper prayse too partiall bee,<br>
And not indifferent to woman kind,<br>
To whom no share in armes and cheualrie<br>
They do impart, ne maken memorie<br>
Of their braue gestes and prowesse martiall;<br>
Scarse do they spare to one or two or three,<br>
Rowme in their writs; yet the same writing small<br>
Does all their deeds deface, and dims their glories all.<p>

But by record of antique times I find,<br>
That women wont in warres to beare most sway,<br>
And to all great exploits them selues inclind:<br>
Of which they still the girlond bore away,<br>
Till enuious Men fearing their rules decay,<br>
Gan coyne streight lawes to curb their liberty;<br>
Yet sith they warlike armes haue layd away:<br>
They haue exceld in artes and pollicy,<br>
That now we foolish men that prayse gin eke t'enuy.<p>

Of warlike puissaunce in ages spent,<br>
Be thou faire <i>Britomart</i>, whose prayse I write,<br>
But of all wisedome be thou precedent,<br>
O soueraigne Queene, whose prayse I would endite,<br>
Endite I would as dewtie doth excite;<br>
But ah my rimes too rude and rugged arre,<br>
When in so high an obiect they do lite,<br>
And striuing, fit to make, I feare do marre:<br>
Thy selfe thy prayses tell, and make them knowen farre.<p>

She trauelling with <i>Guyon</i> by the way,<br>
Of sundry things faire purpose gan to find,<br>
T'abridg their iourney long, and lingring day;<br>
Mongst which it fell into that Faeries mind,<br>
To aske this Briton Mayd, what vncouth wind,<br>
Brought her into those parts, and what inquest<br>
Made her dissemble her disguised kind:<br>
Faire Lady she him seemd, like Lady drest,<br>
But fairest knight aliue, when armed was her brest.<p>

Thereat she sighing softly, had no powre<br>
To speake a while, ne ready answere make,<br>
But with hart-thrilling throbs and bitter stowre,<br>
As if she had a feuer fit, did quake,<br>
And euery daintie limbe with horrour shake;<br>
And euer and anone the rosy red,<br>
Flasht through her face, as it had been a flake<br>
Of lightning, through bright heauen fulmined;<br>
At last the passion past she thus him answered.<p>

Faire Sir, I let you weete, that from the howre<br>
I taken was from nourses tender pap,<br>
I haue beene trained vp in warlike stowre,<br>
To tossen speare and shield, and to affrap<br>
The warlike ryder to his most mishap;<br>
Sithence I loathed haue my life to lead,<br>
As Ladies wont, in pleasures wanton lap,<br>
To finger the fine needle and nyce thread;<br>
Me leuer were with point of foemans speare be dead.<p>

All my delight on deedes of armes is set,<br>
To hunt out perils and aduentures hard,<br>
By sea, by land, where so they may be met,<br>
Onely for honour and for high regard,<br>
Without respect of richesse or reward.<br>
For such intent into these parts I came,<br>
Withouten compasse, or withouten card,<br>
Far fro my natiue soyle, that is by name<br>
The greater <i>Britaine</i>, here to seeke for prayse and fame.<p>

Fame blazed hath, that here in Faery lond<br>
Do many famous Knightes and Ladies wonne,<br>
And many straunge aduentures to be fond,<br>
Of which great worth and worship may be wonne;<br>
Which I to proue, this voyage haue begonne.<br>
But mote I weet of you, right curteous knight,<br>
Tydings of one, that hath vnto me donne<br>
Late foule dishonour and reprochfull spight,<br>
The which I seeke to wreake, and <i>Arthegall</i> he hight.<p>

The word gone out, she backe againe would call,<br>
As her repenting so to haue missayd,<br>
But that he it vp-taking ere the fall,<br>
Her shortly answered; Faire martiall Mayd<br>
Certes ye misauised beene, t'vpbrayd<br>
A gentle knight with so vnknightly blame:<br>
For weet ye well of all, that euer playd<br>
At tilt or tourney, or like warlike game,<br>
The noble <i>Arthegall</i> hath euer borne the name.<p>

For thy great wonder were it, if such shame<br>
Should euer enter in his bounteous thought,<br>
Or euer do, that mote deseruen blame:<br>
The noble courage neuer weeneth ought,<br>
That may vnworthy of it selfe be thought.<br>
Therefore, faire Damzell, be ye well aware,<br>
Least that too farre ye haue your sorrow sought:<br>
You and your countrey both I wish welfare,<br>
And honour both; for each of other worthy are.<p>

The royall Mayd woxe inly wondrous glad,<br>
To heare her Loue so highly magnifide,<br>
And ioyd that euer she affixed had,<br>
Her hart on knight so goodly glorifide,<br>
How euer finely she it faind to hide:<br>
The louing mother, that nine monethes did beare,<br>
In the deare closet of her painefull side,<br>
Her tender babe, it seeing safe appeare,<br>
Doth not so much reioyce, as she reioyced theare.<p>

But to occasion him to further talke,<br>
To feed her humour with his pleasing stile,<br>
Her list in strifull termes with him to balke,<br>
And thus replide, How euer, Sir, ye file<br>
Your curteous tongue, his prayses to compile,<br>
It ill beseemes a knight of gentle sort,<br>
Such as ye haue him boasted, to beguile<br>
A simple mayd, and worke so haynous tort,<br>
In shame of knighthood, as I largely can report.<p>

Let be therefore my vengeaunce to disswade,<br>
And read, where I that faytour false may find.<br>
Ah, but if reason faire might you perswade,<br>
To slake your wrath, and mollifie your mind,<br>
(Said he) perhaps ye should it better find:<br>
For hardy thing it is, to weene by might,<br>
That man to hard conditions to bind,<br>
Or euer hope to match in equall fight,<br>
Whose prowesse paragon saw neuer liuing wight.<p>

Ne soothlich is it easie for to read,<br>
Where now on earth, or how he may be found;<br>
For he ne wonneth in one certaine stead,<br>
But restlesse walketh all the world around,<br>
Ay doing things, that to his fame redound,<br>
Defending Ladies cause, and Orphans right,<br>
Where so he heares, that any doth confound<br>
Them comfortlesse, through tyranny or might:<br>
So is his soueraine honour raisde to heauens hight.<p>

His feeling words her feeble sence much pleased,<br>
And softly sunck into her molten hart;<br>
Hart that is inly hurt, is greatly eased<br>
With hope of thing, that may allegge his smart;<br>
For pleasing words are like to Magick art,<br>
That doth the charmed Snake in slomber lay:<br>
Such secret ease felt gentle <i>Britomart</i>,<br>
Yet list the same efforce with faind gainesay;<br>
So dischord oft in Musick makes the sweeter lay.<p>

And said, Sir knight, these idle termes forbeare,<br>
And sith it is vneath to find his haunt,<br>
Tell me some markes, by which he may appeare,<br>
If chaunce I him encounter parauaunt;<br>
For perdie one shall other slay, or daunt:<br>
What shape, what shield, what armes, what steed, what sted,<br>
And what so else his person most may vaunt?<br>
All which the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight to point ared,<br>
And him in euery part before her fashioned.<p>

Yet him in euery part before she knew,<br>
How euer list her now her knowledge faine,<br>
Sith him whilome in <i>Britaine</i> she did vew,<br>
To her reuealed in a mirrhour plaine,<br>
Whereof did grow her first engraffed paine;<br>
Whose root and stalke so bitter yet did tast,<br>
That but the fruit more sweetnesse did containe,<br>
Her wretched dayes in dolour she mote wast,<br>
And yield the pray of loue to lothsome death at last.<p>

By strange occasion she did him behold,<br>
And much more strangely gan to loue his sight,<br>
As it in bookes hath written bene of old.<br>
In <i>Deheubarth</i> that now South-wales is hight,<br>
What time king <i>Ryence</i> raign'd, and dealed right,<br>
The great Magitian <i>Merlin</i> had deuiz'd,<br>
By his deepe science, and hell-dreaded might,<br>
A looking glasse, right wondrously aguiz'd,<br>
Whose vertues through the wyde world soone were solemniz'd.<p>

It vertue had, to shew in perfect sight,<br>
What euer thing was in the world contaynd,<br>
Betwixt the lowest earth and heauens hight,<br>
So that it to the looker appertaynd;<br>
What euer foe had wrought, or frend had faynd,<br>
Therein discouered was, ne ought mote pas,<br>
Ne ought in secret from the same remaynd;<br>
For thy it round and hollow shaped was,<br>
Like to the world it selfe, and seem'd a world of glas.<p>

Who wonders not, that reades so wonderous worke?<br>
But who does wonder, that has red the Towre,<br>
Wherein th'&AElig;gyptian <i>Phao</i> long did lurke<br>
From all mens vew, that none might her discoure,<br>
Yet she might all men vew out of her bowre?<br>
Great <i>Ptolom&aelig;e</i> it for his lemans sake<br>
Ybuilded all of glasse, by Magicke powre,<br>
And also it impregnable did make;<br>
Yet when his loue was false, he with a peaze it brake.<p>

Such was the glassie globe that <i>Merlin</i> made,<br>
And gaue vnto king <i>Ryence</i> for his gard,<br>
That neuer foes his kingdome might inuade,<br>
But he it knew at home before he hard<br>
Tydings thereof, and so them still debar'd.<br>
It was a famous Present for a Prince,<br>
And worthy worke of infinite reward,<br>
That treasons could bewray, and foes conuince;<br>
Happie this Realme, had it remained euer since.<p>

One day it fortuned, faire <i>Britomart</i><br>
Into her fathers closet to repayre;<br>
For nothing he from her reseru'd apart,<br>
Being his onely daughter and his hayre;<br>
Where when she had espyde that mirrhour fayre,<br>
Her selfe a while therein she vewd in vaine;<br>
Tho her auizing of the vertues rare,<br>
Which thereof spoken were, she gan againe<br>
Her to bethinke of, that mote to her selfe pertaine.<p>

But as it falleth, in the gentlest harts<br>
Imperious Loue hath highest set his throne,<br>
And tyrannizeth in the bitter smarts<br>
Of them, that to him buxome are and prone:<br>
So thought this Mayd (as maydens vse to done)<br>
Whom fortune for her husband would allot,<br>
Not that she lusted after any one;<br>
For she was pure from blame of sinfull blot,<br>
Yet wist her life at last must lincke in that same knot.<p>

Eftsoones there was presented to her eye<br>
A comely knight, all arm'd in complete wize,<br>
Through whose bright ventayle lifted vp on hye<br>
His manly face, that did his foes agrize,<br>
And friends to termes of gentle truce entize,<br>
Lookt foorth, as <i>Phoebus</i> face out of the east,<br>
Betwixt two shadie mountaines doth arize;<br>
Portly his person was, and much increast<br>
Through his Heroicke grace, and honorable gest.<p>

His crest was couered with a couchant Hound,<br>
And all his armour seem'd of antique mould,<br>
But wondrous massie and assured sound,<br>
And round about yfretted all with gold,<br>
In which there written was with cyphers old,<br>
<i>Achilles armes, which Arthegall did win</i>.<br>
And on his shield enueloped seuenfold<br>
He bore a crowned litle Ermilin,<br>
That deckt the azure field with her faire pouldred skin.<p>

The Damzell well did vew his personage,<br>
And liked well, ne further fastned not,<br>
But went her way; ne her vnguilty age<br>
Did weene, vnwares, that her vnlucky lo t<br>
Lay hidden in the bottome of the pot;<br>
Of hurt vnwist most daunger doth redound:<br>
But the false Archer, which that arrow shot<br>
So slyly, that she did not feele the wound,<br>
Did smyle full smoothly at her weetlesse wofull stound.<p>

Thenceforth the feather in her loftie crest,<br>
Ruffed of loue, gan lowly to auaile,<br>
And her proud portance, and her princely gest,<br>
With which she earst tryumphed, now did quail<br>
Sad, solemne, sowre, and full of fancies fraile<br>
She woxe; yet wist she neither how, nor why,<br>
She wist not, silly Mayd, what she did aile,<br>
Yet wist, she was not well at ease perdy,<br>
Yet thought it was not loue, but some melancholy.<p>

So soone as Night had with her pallid hew<br>
Defast the beautie of the shining sky,<br>
And reft from men the worlds desired vew,<br>
She with her Nourse adowne to sleepe did lye;<br>
But sleepe full farre away from her did fly:<br>
In stead thereof sad sighes, and sorrowes deepe<br>
Kept watch and ward about her warily,<br>
That nought she did but wayle, and often steepe<br>
He daintie couch with teares, which closely she did weepe.<p>

And if that any drop of slombring rest<br>
Did chaunce to still into her wearie spright,<br>
When feeble nature felt her selfe opprest,<br>
Streight way with dreames, and with fantasticke sight<br>
Of dreadfull things the same was put to flight,<br>
That oft out of her bed she did astart,<br>
As one with vew of ghastly feends affright:<br>
Tho gan she to renew her former smart,<br>
And thinke of that faire visage, written in her hart.<p>

One night, when she was tost with such vnrest,<br>
Her aged Nurse, whose name was <i>Glauce</i> hight,<br>
Feeling her leape out of her loathed nest,<br>
Betwixt her feeble armes her quickly keight,<br>
And downe againe in her warme bed her dight;<br>
Ah my deare daughter, ah my dearest dread,<br>
What vncouth fit (said she) what euill plight<br>
Hath thee opprest, and with sad drearyhead<br>
Chaunged thy liuely cheare, and liuing made thee dead?<p>

For not of nought these suddeine ghastly feares<br>
All night afflict thy naturall repose,<br>
And all the day, when as thine equall peares,<br>
Their fit disports with faire delight doe chose,<br>
Thou in dull corners doest thy selfe inclose,<br>
Ne tastest Princes pleasures, ne doest spred<br>
Abroad thy fresh youthes fairest flowre, but lose<br>
Both leafe and fruit, both too vntimely shed,<br>
As one in wilfull bale for euer buried.<p>

The time, that mortall men their weary cares<br>
Do lay away, and all wilde beastes do rest,<br>
And euery riuer eke his course forbeares<br>
Then doth this wicked euill thee infest,<br>
And riue with thousand throbs thy thrilled brest;<br>
Like an huge <i>Aetn'</i> of deepe engulfed griefe,<br>
Sorrow is heaped in thy hollow chest,<br>
Whence forth it breakes in sighes and anguish rife,<br>
As smoke and sulphure mingled with confused strife.<p>

Aye me, how much I feare, least loue it bee;<br>
But if that loue it be, as sure I read<br>
By knowen signes and passions, which I see,<br>
Be it worthy of thy race and royall sead,<br>
Then I auow by this most sacred head<br>
Of my deare foster child, to ease thy griefe,<br>
And win thy will: Therefore away doe dread;<br>
For death nor daunger from thy dew reliefe<br>
Shall me debarre, tell me therefore my liefest liefe.<p>

So hauing said, her twixt her armes twaine<br>
She straightly straynd, and colled tenderly,<br>
And euery trembling ioynt, and euery vaine<br>
She softly felt, and rubbed busily,<br>
To doe the frosen cold away to fly;<br>
And her faire deawy eies with kisses deare<br>
She oft did bath, and oft againe did dry;<br>
And euer her importund, not to feare<br>
To let the secret of her hart to her appeare.<p>

The Damzell pauzd, and then thus fearefully;<br>
Ah Nurse, what needeth thee to eke my paine?<br>
Is not enough, that I alone doe dye,<br>
But it must doubled be with death of twaine?<br>
For nought for me but death there doth remaine.<br>
O daughter deare (said she) despaire no whit;<br>
For neuer sore, but might a salue obtaine:<br>
That blinded God, which hath ye blindly smit,<br>
Another arrow hath your louers hart to hit.<p>

But mine is not (quoth she) like others wound;<br>
For which no reason can find remedy.<br>
Was neuer such, but mote the like be found,<br>
(Said she) and though no reason may apply<br>
Salue to your sore, yet loue can higher stye,<br>
Then reasons reach, and oft hath wonders donne.<br>
But neither God of loue, nor God of sky<br>
Can doe (said she) that, which cannot be donne.<br>
Things oft impossible (quoth she) seeme, ere begonne.<p>

These idle words (said she) doe nought asswage<br>
My stubborne smart, but more annoyance breed,<br>
For no no vsuall fire, no vsuall rage<br>
It is, &ocirc; Nurse, which on my life doth feed,<br>
And suckes the bloud, which from my hart doth bleed.<br>
But since thy faithfull zeale lets me not hyde<br>
My crime, (if crime it be) I will it reed.<br>
Nor Prince, nor pere it is, whose loue hath gryde<br>
My feeble brest of late, and launched this wound wyde.<p>

Nor man it is, nor other liuing wight;<br>
For then some hope I might vnto me draw,<br>
But th'only shade and semblant of a knight,<br>
Whose shape or person yet I neuer saw,<br>
Hath me subiected to loues cruell law:<br>
The same one day, as me misfortune led,<br>
I in my fathers wondrous mirrhour saw,<br>
And pleased with that seeming goodly-hed,<br>
Vnwares the hidden hooke with baite I swallowed.<p>

Sithens it hath infixed faster hold<br>
Within my bleeding bowels, and so sore<br>
Now ranckleth in this same fraile fleshly mould,<br>
That all mine entrailes flow with poysnous gore,<br>
And th'vlcer groweth daily more and more;<br>
Ne can my running sore find remedie,<br>
Other then my hard fortune to deplore,<br>
And languish as the leafe falne from the tree,<br>
Till death make one end of my dayes and miserie.<p>

Daughter (said she) what need ye be dismayd,<br>
Or why make ye such Monster of your mind?<br>
Of much more vncouth thing I was affrayd;<br>
Of filthy lust, contrarie vnto kind:<br>
But this affection nothing straunge I find;<br>
For who with reason can you aye reproue,<br>
To loue the semblant pleasing most your mind,<br>
And yield your heart, whence ye cannot remoue?<br>
No guilt in you, but in the tyranny of loue.<p>

Not so th'<i>Arabian Myrrhe</i> did set her mind;<br>
Nor so did <i>Biblis</i> spend her pining hart,<br>
But lou'd their natiue flesh against all kind,<br>
And to their purpose vsed wicked art:<br>
Yet playd <i>Pasipha&euml;</i> a more monstrous part,<br>
That lou'd a Bull, and learnd a beast to bee;<br>
Such shamefull lusts who loaths not, which depart<br>
From course of nature and of modestie?<br>
Sweet loue such lewdnes bands from his faire companie.<p>

But thine my Deare (welfare thy heart my deare)<br>
Though strange beginning had, yet fixed is<br>
On one, that worthy may perhaps appeare;<br>
And certes seemes bestowed not amis:<br>
Ioy thereof haue thou and eternall blis.<br>
With that vpleaning on her elbow weake,<br>
Her alablaster brest she soft did kis,<br>
Which all that while she felt to pant and quake,<br>
As it an Earth-quake were; at last she thus bespake.<p>

Beldame, your words doe worke me litle ease;<br>
For though my loue be not so lewdly bent,<br>
As those ye blame, yet may it nought appease<br>
My raging smart, ne ought my flame relent,<br>
But rather doth my helpelesse griefe augment.<br>
For they, how euer shamefull and vnkind,<br>
Yet did possesse their horrible intent:<br>
Short end of sorrowes they thereby did find;<br>
So was their fortune good, though wicked were their mind.<p>

But wicked fortune mine, though mind be good,<br>
Can haue no end, nor hope of my desire,<br>
But feed on shadowes, whiles I die for food,<br>
And like a shadow wexe, whiles with entire<br>
Affection, I doe languish and expire.<br>
I fonder, then <i>Cephisus</i> foolish child,<br>
Who hauing vewed in a fountaine shere<br>
His face, was with the loue thereof beguild;<br>
I fonder loue a shade, the bodie farre exild.<p>

Nought like (quoth she) for that same wretched boy<br>
Was of himselfe the idle Paramoure;<br>
Both loue and louer, without hope of ioy,<br>
For which he faded to a watry flowre.<br>
But better fortune thine, and better howre,<br>
Which lou'st the shadow of a warlike knight;<br>
No shadow, but a bodie hath in powre:<br>
That bodie, wheresoeuer that it light,<br>
May learned be by cyphers, or by Magicke might.<p>

But if thou may with reason yet represse<br>
The growing euill, ere it strength haue got,<br>
And thee abandond wholly doe possesse,<br>
Against it strongly striue, and yield thee not,<br>
Till thou in open field adowne be smot.<br>
But if the passion mayster thy fraile might,<br>
So that needs loue or death must be thy lot,<br>
Then I auow to thee, by wrong or right<br>
To compasse thy desire, and find that loued knight.<p>

Her chearefull words much cheard the feeble spright<br>
Of the sicke virgin, that her downe she layd<br>
In her warme bed to sleepe, if that she might;<br>
And the old-woman carefully displayd<br>
The clothes about her round with busie ayd;<br>
So that at last a little creeping sleepe<br>
Surprisd her sense: she therewith well apayd,<br>
The drunken lampe downe in the oyle did steepe,<br>
And set her by to watch, and set her by to weepe.<p>

Earely the morrow next, before that day<br>
His ioyous face did to the world reueale,<br>
They both vprose and tooke their readie way<br>
Vnto the Church, their prayers to appeale,<br>
With great deuotion, and with litle zeale:<br>
For the faire Damzell from the holy herse<br>
Her loue-sicke hart to other thoughts did steale;<br>
And that old Dame said many an idle verse,<br>
Out of her daughters hart fond fancies to reuerse.<p>

Returned home, the royall Infant fell<br>
Into her former fit; for why, no powre<br>
Nor guidance of her selfe in her did dwell.<br>
But th'aged Nurse her calling to her bowre,<br>
Had gathered Rew, and Sauine, and the flowre<br>
Of <i>Camphara</i>, and Calamint, and Dill,<br>
All which she in a earthen Pot did poure,<br>
And to the brim with Colt wood did it fill,<br>
And many drops of milke and bloud through it did spill.<p>

Then taking thrise three haires from off her head,<br>
Them trebly breaded in a threefold lace,<br>
And round about the pots mouth, bound the thread,<br>
And after hauing whispered a space<br>
Certaine sad words, with hollow voice and bace,<br>
She to the virgin said, thrise said she it;<br>
Come daughter come, come; spit vpon my face,<br>
Spit thrise vpon me, thrise vpon me spit;<br>
Th'vneuen number for this businesse is most fit.<p>

That sayd, her round about she from her turnd,<br>
She turned her contrarie to the Sunne,<br>
Thrise she her turnd contrary, and returnd,<br>
All contrary, for she the right did shunne,<br>
And euer what she did, was streight vndonne.<br>
So thought she to vndoe her daughters loue:<br>
But loue, that is in gentle brest begonne,<br>
No idle charmes so lightly may remoue,<br>
That well can witnesse, who by triall it does proue.<p>

Ne ought it mote the noble Mayd auayle,<br>
Ne slake the furie of her cruell flame,<br>
But that she still did waste, and still did wayle,<br>
That through long languour, and hart-burning brame<br>
She shortly like a pyned ghost became,<br>
Which long hath waited by the Stygian strond.<br>
That when old <i>Glauce</i> saw, for feare least blame<br>
Of her miscarriage should in her be fond,<br>
She wist not how t'amend, nor how it to withstond.<p>
