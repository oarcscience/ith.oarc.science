*Cant. VII.*

> *The Redcrosse knight is captiue made  
> By Gyaunt proud opprest,  
> Prince Arthur meets with Vna great-  
> ly with those newes distrest.*

> WHat man so wise, what earthly wit so ware,  
> As to descry the crafty cunning traine,  
> By which deceipt doth maske in visour faire,  
> And cast her colours dyed deepe in graine,  
> To seeme like Truth, whose shape she well can faine,  
> And fitting gestures to her purpose frame;  
> The guiltlesse man with guile to entertaine?  
> Great maistresse of her art was that false Dame,  
> The false *Duessa*, cloked with *Fidessaes* name.
>
> Who when returning from the drery *Night*,  
> She fownd not in that perilous house of *Pryde*,  
> Where she had left, the noble *Redcrosse* knight,  
> Her hoped pray, she would no lenger bide,  
> But forth she went, to seeke him far and wide.  
> Ere long she fownd, whereas he wearie sate,  
> To rest him selfe, foreby a fountaine side,  
> Disarmed all of yron-coted Plate,  
> And by his side his steed the grassy forage ate.
>
> He feedes vpon the cooling shade, and bayes  
> His sweatie forehead in the breathing wind,  
> Which through the trẽbling leaues full gently playes  
> Wherein the cherefull birds of sundry kind  
> Do chaunt sweet musick, to delight his mind:  
> The Witch approching gan him fairely greet,  
> And with reproch of carelesnesse vnkind  
> Vpbrayd, for leauing her in place vnmeet,  
> With fowle words tempring faire, soure gall with hony sweet.
>
> Vnkindnesse past, they gan of solace treat,  
> And bathe in pleasaunce of the ioyous shade,  
> Which shielded them against the boyling heat,  
> And with greene boughes decking a gloomy glade,  
> About the fountaine like a girlond made;  
> Whose bubbling waue did euer freshly well,  
> Ne euer would through feruent sommer fade:  
> The sacred Nymph, which therein wont to dwell,  
> Was out of *Dianes* fauour, as it then befell.
>
> The cause was this: one day when *Phoebe* fayre  
> With all her band was following the chace,  
> This Nymph, quite tyr'd with heat of scorching ayre,  
> Sat downe to rest in middest of the race:  
> The goddesse wroth gan fowly her disgrace,  
> And bad the waters, which from her did flow,  
> Be such as she her selfe was then in place.  
> Thenceforth her waters waxed dull and slow,  
> And all that drunke thereof, did faint and feeble grow.
>
> Hereof this gentle knight vnweeting was,  
> And lying downe vpon the sandie graile,  
> Drunke of the streame, as cleare as cristall glas;  
> Eftsoones his manly forces gan to faile,  
> And mightie strong was turnd to feeble fraile.  
> His chaunged powres at first them selues not felt,  
> Till crudled cold his corage gan assaile,  
> And chearefull bloud in faintnesse chill did melt,  
> Which like a feuer fit through all his body swelt.
>
> Yet goodly court he made still to his Dame,  
> Pourd out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd,  
> Both carelesse of his health, and of his fame:  
> Till at the last he heard a dreadfull sownd,  
> Which through the wood loud bellowing, did rebownd,  
> That all the earth for terrour seemd to shake,  
> And trees did tremble. Th'Elfe therewith astownd,  
> Vpstarted lightly from his looser make,  
> And his vnready weapons gan in hand to take.
>
> But ere he could his armour on him dight,  
> Or get his shield, his monstrous enimy  
> With sturdie steps came stalking in his sight,  
> An hideous Geant horrible and hye,  
> That with his talnesse seemd to threat the skye,  
> The ground eke groned vnder him for dreed;  
> His liuing like saw neuer liuing eye,  
> Ne durst behold: his stature did exceed  
> The hight of three the tallest sonnes of mortall seed.
>
> The greatest Earth his vncouth mother was,  
> And blustring *AEolus* his boasted sire,  
> Who with his breath, which through the world doth pas,  
> Her hollow womb did secretly inspire,  
> And fild her hidden caues with stormie yre,  
> That she conceiu'd; and trebling the dew time,  
> In which the wombes of women do expire,  
> Brought forth this monstrous masse of earthly slime,  
> Puft vp with emptie wind, and fild with sinfull crime.
>
> So growen great through arrogant delight  
> Of th'high descent, whereof he was yborne,  
> And through presumption of his matchlesse might,  
> All other powres and knighthood he did scorne.  
> Such now he marcheth to this man forlorne,  
> And left to losse: his stalking steps are stayde  
> Vpon a snaggy Oke, which he had torne  
> Out of his mothers bowelles, and it made  
> His mortall mace, wherewith his foemen he dismayde.
>
> That when the knight he spide, he gan aduance  
> With huge force and insupportable mayne,  
> And towardes him with dreadfull fury praunce;  
> Who haplesse, and eke hopelesse, all in vaine  
> Did to him pace, sad battaile to darrayne,  
> Disarmd, disgrast, and inwardly dismayde,  
> And eke so faint in euery ioynt and vaine,  
> Through that fraile fountaine, which him feeble made,  
> That scarsely could he weeld his bootlesse single blade.
>
> The Geaunt strooke so maynly mercilesse,  
> That could haue ouerthrowne a stony towre,  
> And were not heauenly grace, that him did blesse,  
> He had beene pouldred all, as thin as flowre:  
> But he was wary of that deadly stowre,  
> And lightly lept from vnderneath the blow:  
> Yet so exceeding was the villeins powre,  
> That with the wind it did him ouerthrow,  
> And all his sences stound, that still he lay full low.
>
> As when that diuelish yron Engin wrought  
> In deepest Hell, and framd by *Furies* skill,  
> With windy Nitre and quick Sulphur fraught,  
> And ramd with bullet round, ordaind to kill,  
> Conceiueth fire, the heauens it doth fill  
> With thundring noyse, and all the ayre doth choke,  
> That none can breath, nor see, nor heare at will,  
> Through smouldry cloud of duskish stincking smoke,  
> That th'onely breath him daunts, who hath escapt the stroke.
>
> So daunted when the Geaunt saw the knight,  
> His heauie hand he heaued vp on hye,  
> And him to dust thought to haue battred quight,  
> Vntill *Duessa* loud to him gan crye;  
> O great *Orgoglio*, greatest vnder skye,  
> O hold thy mortall hand for Ladies sake,  
> Hold for my sake, and do him not to dye,  
> But vanquisht thine eternall bondslaue make,  
> And me thy worthy meed vnto thy Leman take.
>
> He hearkned, and did stay from further harmes,  
> To gayne so goodly guerdon, as she spake:  
> So willingly she came into his armes,  
> Who her as willingly to grace did take,  
> And was possessed of his new found make.  
> Then vp he tooke the slombred sencelesse corse,  
> And ere he could out of his swowne awake,  
> Him to his castle brought with hastie forse,  
> And in a Dongeon deepe him threw without remorse.
>
> From that day forth *Duessa* was his deare,  
> And highly honourd in his haughtie eye,  
> He gaue her gold and purple pall to weare,  
> And triple crowne set on her head full hye,  
> And her endowd with royall maiestye:  
> Then for to make her dreaded more of men,  
> And peoples harts with awfull terrour tye,  
> A monstrous beast ybred in filthy fen  
> He chose, which he had kept long time in darksome den.
>
> Such one it was, as that renowmed Snake  
> Which great *Alcides* in *Stremona* slew,  
> Long fostred in the filth of *Lerna* lake,  
> Whose many heads out budding euer new,  
> Did breed him endlesse labour to subdew:  
> But this same Monster much more vgly was;  
> For seuen great heads out of his body grew,  
> An yron brest, and backe of scaly bras,  
> And all embrewd in bloud, his eyes did shine as glas.
>
> His tayle was stretched out in wondrous length,  
> That to the house of heauenly gods it raught,  
> And with extorted powre, and borrow'd strength,  
> The euer-burning lamps from thence it braught,  
> And prowdly threw to ground, as things of naught;  
> And vnderneath his filthy feet did tread  
> The sacred things, and holy heasts foretaught.  
> Vpon this dreadfull Beast with seuenfold head  
> He set the false *Duessa*, for more aw and dread.
>
> The wofull Dwarfe, which saw his maisters fall,  
> Whiles he had keeping of his grasing steed,  
> And valiant knight become a caytiue thrall,  
> When all was past, tooke vp his forlorne weed,  
> His mightie armour, missing most at need;  
> His siluer shield, now idle maisterlesse;  
> His poynant speare, that many made to bleed,  
> The ruefull moniments of heauinesse,  
> And with them all departes, to tell his great distresse.
>
> He had not trauaild long, when on the way  
> He wofull Ladie, wofull *Vna* met,  
> Fast flying from the Paynims greedy pray,  
> Whilest *Satyrane* him from pursuit did let:  
> Who when her eyes she on the Dwarf had set,  
> And saw the signes, that deadly tydings spake,  
> She fell to ground for sorrowfull regret,  
> And liuely breath her sad brest did forsake,  
> Yet might her pitteous hart be seene to pant and quake.
>
> The messenger of so vnhappie newes  
> Would faine haue dyde: dead was his hart within,  
> Yet outwardly some little comfort shewes:  
> At last recouering hart, he does begin  
> To rub her temples, and to chaufe her chin,  
> And euery tender part does tosse and turne:  
> So hardly he the flitted life does win,  
> Vnto her natiue prison to retourne:  
> Then gins her grieued ghost thus to lament and mourne.
>
> Ye dreary instruments of dolefull sight,  
> That doe this deadly spectacle behold,  
> Why do ye lenger feed on loathed light,  
> Or liking find to gaze on earthly mould,  
> Sith cruell fates the carefull threeds vnfould,  
> The which my life and loue together tyde?  
> Now let the stony dart of senselesse cold  
> Perce to my hart, and pas through euery side,  
> And let eternall night so sad \[sight\] fro me hide.
>
> O lightsome day, the lampe of highest *Ioue*,  
> First made by him, mens wandring wayes to guyde,  
> When darknesse he in deepest dongeon droue,  
> Henceforth thy hated face for euer hyde,  
> And shut vp heauens windowes shyning wyde:  
> For earthly sight can nought but sorow breed,  
> And late repentance, which shall long abyde.  
> Mine eyes no more on vanitie shall feed,  
> But seeled vp with death, shall haue their deadly meed.
>
> Then downe againe she fell vnto the ground;  
> But he her quickly reared vp againe:  
> Thrise did she sinke adowne in deadly swownd,  
> And thrise he her reviu'd with busie paine:  
> At last when life recouer'd had the raine,  
> And ouer-wrestled his strong enemie,  
> With foltring tong, and trembling euery vaine,  
> Tell on (quoth she) the wofull Tragedie,  
> The which these reliques sad present vnto mine eie.
>
> Tempestuous fortune hath spent all her spight,  
> And thrilling sorrow throwne his vtmost dart;  
> Thy sad tongue cannot tell more heauy plight,  
> Then that I feele, and harbour in mine hart:  
> Who hath endur'd the whole, can beare each part.  
> If death it be, it is not the first wound,  
> That launched hath my brest with bleeding smart.  
> Begin, and end the bitter balefull stound;  
> If lesse, then that I feare, more fauour I haue found.
>
> Then gan the Dwarfe the whole discourse declare,  
> The subtill traines of *Archimago* old;  
> The wanton loues of false *Fidessa* faire,  
> Bought with the bloud of vanquisht Paynim bold:  
> The wretched payre transform'd to treen mould;  
> The house of Pride, and perils round about;  
> The combat, which he with *Sansioy* did hould;  
> The lucklesse conflict with the Gyant stout,  
> Wherein captiu'd, of life or death he stood in doubt.
>
> She heard with patience all vnto the end,  
> And stroue to maister sorrowfull assay,  
> Which greater grew, the more she did contend,  
> And almost rent her tender hart in tway;  
> And loue fresh coles vnto her fire did lay:  
> For greater loue, the greater is the losse.  
> Was neuer Ladie loued dearer day,  
> Then she did loue the knight of the *Redcrosse*;  
> For whose deare sake so many troubles her did tosse.
>
> At last when feruent sorrow slaked was,  
> She vp arose, resoluing him to find  
> A liue or dead: and forward forth doth pas,  
> All as the Dwarfe the way to her assynd:  
> And euermore in constant carefull mind  
> She fed her wound with fresh renewed bale;  
> Long tost with stormes, and bet with bitter wind,  
> High ouer hils, and low adowne the dale,  
> She wandred many a wood, and measurd many a vale.
>
> At last she chaunced by good hap to meet  
> A goodly knight, faire marching by the way  
> Together with his Squire, arayed meet:  
> His glitterand armour shined farre away,  
> Like glauncing light of *Phoebus* brightest ray;  
> From top to toe no place appeared bare,  
> That deadly dint of steele endanger may:  
> Athwart his brest a bauldrick braue he ware,  
> That shynd, like twinkling stars, with stons most pretious rare.
>
> And in the midst thereof one pretious stone  
> Of wondrous worth, and eke of wondrous mights,  
> Shapt like a Ladies head, exceeding shone,  
> Like *Hesperus* emongst the lesser lights,  
> And stroue for to amaze the weaker sights;  
> Thereby his mortall blade full comely hong  
> In yuory sheath, ycaru'd with curious slights;  
> Whose hilts were burnisht gold, and handle strong  
> Of mother pearle, and buckled with a golden tong.
>
> His haughtie helmet, horrid all with gold,  
> Both glorious brightnesse, and great terrour bred;  
> For all the crest a Dragon did enfold  
> With greedie pawes, and ouer all did spred  
> His golden wings: his dreadfull hideous hed  
> Close couched on the beuer, seem'd to throw  
> From flaming mouth bright sparkles fierie red,  
> That suddeine horror to faint harts did show;  
> And scaly tayle was stretcht adowne his backe full low.
>
> Vpon the top of all his loftie crest,  
> A bunch of haires discolourd diuersly,  
> With sprincled pearle, and gold full richly drest,  
> Did shake, and seem'd to daunce for iollity,  
> Like to an Almond tree ymounted hye  
> On top of greene *Selinis* all alone,  
> With blossomes braue bedecked daintily;  
> Whose tender locks do tremble euery one  
> At euery little breath, that vnder heauen is blowne.
>
> His warlike shield all closely couer'd was,  
> Ne might of mortall eye be euer seene;  
> Not made of steele, nor of enduring bras,  
> Such earthly mettals soone consumed bene:  
> But all of Diamond perfect pure and cleene  
> It framed was, one massie entire mould,  
> Hewen out of Adamant rocke with engines keene,  
> That point of speare it neuer percen could,  
> Ne dint of direfull sword diuide the substance would.
>
> The same to wight he neuer wont disclose,  
> But when as monsters huge he would dismay,  
> Or daunt vnequall armies of his foes,  
> Or when the flying heauens he would affray;  
> For so exceeding shone his glistring ray,  
> That *Phoebus* golden face it did attaint,  
> As when a cloud his beames doth ouer-lay;  
> And siluer *Cynthia* wexed pale and faint,  
> As when her face is staynd with magicke arts constraint.
>
> No magicke arts hereof had any might,  
> Nor bloudie wordes of bold Enchaunters call,  
> But all that was not such, as seemd in sight,  
> Before that shield did fade, and suddeine fall:  
> And when him list the raskall routes appall,  
> Men into stones therewith he could transmew,  
> And stones to dust, and dust to nought at all;  
> And when him list the prouder lookes subdew,  
> He would them gazing blind, or turne to other hew.
>
> Ne let it seeme, that credence this exceedes,  
> For he that made the same, was knowne right well  
> To haue done much more admirable deedes.  
> It *Merlin* was, which whylome did excell  
> All liuing wightes in might of magicke spell:  
> Both shield, and sword, and armour all he wrought  
> For this young Prince, when first to armes he fell;  
> But when he dyde, the Faerie Queene it brought  
> To Faerie lond, where yet it may be seene, if sought.
>
> A gentle youth, his dearely loued Squire  
> His speare of heben wood behind him bare,  
> Whose harmefull head, thrice heated in the fire,  
> Had riuen many a brest with pikehead square;  
> A goodly person, and could menage faire  
> His stubborne steed with curbed canon bit,  
> Who vnder him did trample as the aire,  
> And chauft, that any on his backe should sit;  
> The yron rowels into frothy fome he bit.
>
> When as this knight nigh to the Ladie drew,  
> With louely court he gan her entertaine;  
> But when he heard her answeres loth, he knew  
> Some secret sorrow did her heart distraine:  
> Which to allay, and calme her storming paine,  
> Faire feeling words he wisely gan display,  
> And for her humour fitting purpose faine,  
> To tempt the cause it selfe for to bewray;  
> Wherewith emmou'd, these bleeding words she gan to say.
>
> What worlds delight, or ioy of liuing speach  
> Can heart, so plung'd in sea of sorrowes deepe,  
> And heaped with so huge misfortunes, reach?  
> The carefull cold beginneth for to creepe,  
> And in my heart his yron arrow steepe,  
> Soone as I thinke vpon my bitter bale:  
> Such helplesse harmes yts better hidden keepe,  
> Then rip vp griefe, where it may not auaile,  
> My last left comfort is, my woes to weepe and waile.
>
> Ah Ladie deare, quoth then the gentle knight,  
> Well may I weene, your griefe is wondrous great;  
> For wondrous great griefe groneth in my spright,  
> Whiles thus I heare you of your sorrowes treat.  
> But wofull Ladie let me you intrete,  
> For to vnfold the anguish of your hart:  
> Mishaps are maistred by aduice discrete,  
> And counsell mittigates the greatest smart;  
> Found neuer helpe, who neuer would his hurts impart.
>
> O but (quoth she) great griefe will not be tould,  
> And can more easily be thought, then said.  
> Right so; (quoth he) but he, that neuer would,  
> Could neuer: will to might giues greatest aid.  
> But griefe (quoth she) does greater grow displaid,  
> If then it find not helpe, and breedes despaire.  
> Despaire breedes not (quoth he) where faith is staid.  
> No faith so fast (quoth she) but flesh does paire.  
> Flesh may empaire (quoth he) but reason can repaire.
>
> His goodly reason, and well guided speach  
> So deepe did settle in her gratious thought,  
> That her perswaded to disclose the breach,  
> Which loue and fortune in her heart had wrought,  
> And said; faire Sir, I hope good hap hath brought  
> You to inquere the secrets of my griefe,  
> Or that your wisedome will direct my thought,  
> Or that your prowesse can me yield reliefe:  
> Then heare the storie sad, which I shall tell you briefe.
>
> The forlorne Maiden, whom your eyes haue seene  
> The laughing stocke of fortunes mockeries,  
> Am th'only daughter of a King and Queene,  
> Whose parents deare, whilest equall destinies  
> Did runne about, and their felicities  
> The fauourable heauens did not enuy,  
> Did spread their rule through all the territories,  
> Which *Phison* and *Euphrates* floweth by,  
> And *Gehons* golden waues doe wash continually.
>
> Till that their cruell cursed enemy,  
> An huge great Dragon horrible in sight,  
> Bred in the loathly lakes of *Tartary*,  
> With murdrous rauine, and deuouring might  
> Their kingdome spoild, and countrey wasted quight:  
> Themselues, for feare into his iawes to fall,  
> He forst to castle strong to take their flight,  
> Where fast embard in mightie brasen wall,  
> He has them now foure yeres besiegd to make thẽ thrall.
>
> Full many knights aduenturous and stout  
> Haue enterprizd that Monster to subdew;  
> From euery coast that heauen walks about,  
> Haue thither come the noble Martiall crew,  
> That famous hard atchieuements still pursew,  
> Yet neuer any could that girlond win,  
> But all still shronke, and still he greater grew:  
> All they for want of faith, or guilt of sin,  
> The pitteous pray of his fierce crueltie haue bin.
>
> At last yledd with farre reported praise,  
> Which flying fame throughout the world had spred,  
> Of doughtie knights, whom Faery land did raise,  
> That noble order hight of Maidenhed,  
> Forthwith to court of *Gloriane* I sped,  
> Of *Gloriane* great Queene of glory bright,  
> Whose kingdomes seat *Cleopolis* is red,  
> There to obtaine some such redoubted knight,  
> That Parents deare from tyrants powre deliuer might.
>
> It was my chance (my chance was faire and good)  
> There for to find a fresh vnproued knight,  
> Whose manly hands imbrew'd in guiltie blood  
> Had neuer bene, ne euer by his might  
> Had throwne to ground the vnregarded right:  
> Yet of his prowesse proofe he since hath made  
> (I witnesse am) in many a cruell fight;  
> The groning ghosts of many one dismaide  
> Haue felt the bitter dint of his auenging blade.
>
> And ye the forlorne reliques of his powre,  
> His byting sword, and his deuouring speare,  
> Which haue endured many a dreadfull stowre,  
> Can speake his prowesse, that did earst you beare,  
> And well could rule: now he hath left you heare,  
> To be the record of his ruefull losse,  
> And of my dolefull disauenturous deare:  
> O heauie record of the good *Redcrosse*,  
> Where haue you left your Lord, that could so well you tosse?
>
> Well hoped I, and faire beginnings had,  
> That he my captiue langour should redeeme,  
> Till all vnweeting, an Enchaunter bad  
> His sence abusd, and made him to misdeeme  
> My loyalty, not such as it did seeme;  
> That rather death desire, then such despight.  
> Be iudge ye heauens, that all things right esteeme,  
> How I him lou'd, and loue with all my might,  
> So thought I eke of him, and thinke I thought aright.
>
> Thenceforth me desolate he quite forsooke,  
> To wander, where wilde fortune would me lead,  
> And other bywaies he himselfe betooke,  
> Where neuer foot of liuing wight did tread,  
> That brought not backe the balefull body dead;  
> In which him chaunced false *Duessa* meete,  
> Mine onely foe, mine onely deadly dread,  
> Who with her witchcraft and misseeming sweete,  
> Inueigled him to follow her desires vnmeete.
>
> At last by subtill sleights she him betraid  
> Vnto his foe, a Gyant huge and tall,  
> Who him disarmed, dissolute, dismaid,  
> Vnwares surprised, and with mightie mall  
> The monster mercilesse him made to fall,  
> Whose fall did neuer foe before behold;  
> And now in darkesome dungeon, wretched thrall,  
> Remedilesse, for aie he doth him hold;  
> This is my cause of griefe, more great, then may be told.
>
> Ere she had ended all, she gan to faint:  
> But he her comforted and faire bespake,  
> Certes, Madame, ye haue great cause of plaint,  
> That stoutest heart, I weene, could cause to quake.  
> But be of cheare, and comfort to you take:  
> For till I haue acquit your captiue knight,  
> Assure your selfe, I will you not forsake.  
> His chearefull words reuiu'd her chearelesse spright,  
> So forth they went, the Dwarfe them guiding euer right.
