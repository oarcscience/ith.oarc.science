<blockquote>
<i>Calepine by a saluage man<br>
from Turpine reskewed is;<br>
And whylest an Infant from a Beare<br>
he saues, his loue doth misse.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
L
Ike as a ship with dreadfull storme long tost,<br>
Hauing spent all her mastes and her ground-hold,<br>
Now farre from harbour likely to be lost,<br>
At last some fisher barke doth neare behold,<br>
That giueth comfort to her courage cold.<br>
Such was the state of this most courteous knight<br>
Being oppressed by that faytour bold,<br>
That he remayned in most perilous plight,<br>
And his sad Ladie left in pitifull affright.<p>

Till that by fortune, passing all foresight,<br>
A saluage man, which in those woods did wonne,<br>
Drawne with that Ladies loud and piteous shright,<br>
Toward the same incessantly did ronne,<br>
To vnderstand what there was to be donne.<br>
There he this most discourteous crauen found,<br>
As fiercely yet, as when he first begonne,<br>
Chasing the gentle <i>Calepine</i> around,<br>
Ne sparing him the more for all his grieuous wound.<p>

The saluage man, that neuer till this houre<br>
Did taste of pittie, neither gentlesse knew,<br>
Seeing his sharpe assault and cruell stoure<br>
Was much emmoued at his perils vew,<br>
That euen his ruder hart began to rew,<br>
And feele compassion of his euill plight<br>
Against his foe that did him so pursew:<br>
From whom he meant to free him, if he might,<br>
And him auenge of that so villenous despight.<p>

Yet armes or weapon had he none to fight,<br>
Ne knew the vse of warlike instruments,<br>
Saue such as sudden rage him lent to smite,<br>
But naked without needfull vestiments,<br>
To clad his corpse with meete habiliments,<br>
He cared not for dint of sword nor speere,<br>
No more then for the stroke of strawes or bents:<br>
For from his mothers wombe, which him did beare<br>
He was invulnerable made by Magicke leare.<p>

He stayed not t'aduize, which way were best<br>
His foe t'assayle, or how himselfe to gard,<br>
But with fierce fury and with force infest<br>
Vpon him ran; who being well prepard,<br>
His first assault full warily did ward,<br>
And with the push of his sharp-pointed speare<br>
Full on the breast him strooke, so strong and hard,<br>
That forst him backe recoyle, and reele areare;<br>
Yet in his bodie made no wound nor bloud appeare.<p>

With that the wyld man more enraged grew,<br>
Like to a Tygre that hath mist his pray,<br>
And with mad mood againe vpon him flew,<br>
Regarding neither speare, that mote him flay,<br>
Nor his fierce steed, that mote him much dismay,<br>
The saluage nation doth all dread despize:<br>
Tho on his shield he griple hold did lay,<br>
And held the same so hard, that by no wize<br>
He could him force to loose, or leaue his enterprize.<p>

Long did he wrest and wring it to and fro,<br>
And euery way did try, but all in vaine:<br>
For he would not his greedie grype forgoe,<br>
But hayld and puld with all his might and maine,<br>
That from his steed him nigh he drew againe.<br>
Who hauing now no vse of his long speare,<br>
So nigh at hand, nor force his shield to straine,<br>
Both speare and shield, as things that needlesse were,<br>
He quite forsooke, and fled himselfe away for feare.<p>

But after him the wyld man ran apace<br>
And him pursewed with importune speed,<br>
(For he was swift as any Bucke in chace)<br>
And had he not in his extreamest need,<br>
Bene helped through the swiftnesse of his steed,<br>
He had him ouertaken in his flight.<br>
Who euer, as he saw him nigh succeed,<br>
Gan cry aloud with horrible affright,<br>
And shrieked out, a thing vncomely for a knight.<p>

But when the Saluage saw his labour vaine,<br>
In following of him, that fled so fast,<br>
He wearie woxe, and backe return'd againe<br>
With speede vnto the place, whereas he last<br>
Had left that couple, nere their vtmost cast.<br>
There he that knight full sorely bleeding found<br>
And eke the Ladie fearefully aghast,<br>
Both for the perill of the present stound,<br>
And also for the sharpnesse of her rankling wound.<p>

For though she were right glad, so rid to bee<br>
From that vile lozell, which her late offended,<br>
Yet now no lesse encombrance she did see,<br>
And perill by this saluage man pretended;<br>
Gainst whom she saw no meanes to be defended,<br>
By reason that her knight was wounded sore.<br>
Therefore her selfe she wholy recommended<br>
To Gods sole grace, whom she did oft implore,<br>
To send her succour, being of all hope forlore.<p>

But the wyld man, contrarie to her feare,<br>
Came to her creeping like a fawning hound,<br>
And by rude tokens made to her appeare<br>
His deepe compassion of her dolefull stound,<br>
Kissing his hands, and crouching to the ground;<br>
For other language had he none nor speach,<br>
But a soft murmure, and confused sound<br>
Of senselesse words, which nature did him teach,<br>
T'expresse his passions, which his reason did empeach.<p>

And comming likewise to the wounded knight,<br>
When he beheld the streames of purple blood<br>
Yet flowing fresh, as moued with the sight,<br>
He made great mone after his saluage mood:<br>
And running streight into the thickest wood,<br>
A certaine herbe from thence vnto him brought,<br>
Whose vertue he by vse well vnderstood:<br>
The iuyce whereof into his wound he wrought,<br>
And stopt the bleeding straight, ere he it staunched thought.<p>

Then taking vp that Recreants shield and speare,<br>
Which earst he left, he signes vnto them made,<br>
With him to wend vnto his wonning neare:<br>
To which he easily did them perswade.<br>
Farre in the forrest by a hollow glade,<br>
Couered with mossie shrubs, which spredding brode<br>
Did vnderneath them make a gloomy shade;<br>
Where foot of liuing creature neuer troade,<br>
Ne scarse wyld beasts durst come, there was this wights abode.<p>

Thether he brought these vnacquainted guests;<br>
To whom faire semblance, as he could, he shewed<br>
By signes, by lookes, and all his other gests.<br>
But the bare ground, with hoarie mosse bestrowed,<br>
Must be their bed, their pillow was vnsowed,<br>
And the frutes of the forrest was their feast:<br>
For their bad Stuard neither plough'd nor sowed,<br>
Ne fed on flesh, ne euer of wyld beast<br>
Did taste the bloud, obaying natures first beheast.<p>

Yet howsoeuer base and meane it were,<br>
They tooke it well, and thanked God for all,<br>
Which had them freed from that deadly feare,<br>
And sau'd from being to that caitiue thrall.<br>
Here they of force (as fortune now did fall)<br>
Compelled were themselues a while to rest,<br>
Glad of that easement, though it were but small;<br>
That hauing there their wounds awhile redrest,<br>
They mote the abler be to passe vnto the rest.<p>

During which time, that wyld man did apply<br>
His best endeuour, and his daily paine,<br>
In seeking all the woods both farre and nye<br>
For herbes to dresse their wounds; still seeming faine,<br>
When ought he did, that did their lyking gaine.<br>
So as ere long he had that knightes wound<br>
Recured well, and made him whole againe:<br>
But that same Ladies hurts no herbe he found,<br>
Which could redresse, for it was inwardly vnsound.<p>

Now when as <i>Calepine</i> was woxen strong,<br>
Vpon a day he cast abrode to wend,<br>
To take the ayre, and heare the thrushes song,<br>
Vnarm'd, as fearing neither foe nor frend,<br>
And without sword his person to defend.<br>
There him befell, vnlooked for before,<br>
An hard aduenture with vnhappie end;<br>
A cruell Beare, the which an infant bore<br>
Betwixt his bloodie iawes, besprinckled all with gore.<p>

The litle babe did loudly scrike and squall,<br>
And all the woods with piteous plaints did fill,<br>
As if his cry did meane for helpe to call<br>
To <i>Calepine</i>, whose eares those shrieches shrill<br>
Percing his hart with pities point did thrill;<br>
That after him he ran with zealous haste,<br>
To rescue th'infant, ere he did him kill:<br>
Whom though he saw now somewhat ouerpast,<br>
Yet by the cry he follow'd, and pursewed fast.<p>

Well then him chaunst his heauy armes to want,<br>
Whose burden mote empeach his needfull speed,<br>
And hinder him from libertie to pant:<br>
For hauing long time, as his daily weed,<br>
Them wont to weare, and wend on foot for need,<br>
Now wanting them he felt himselfe so light,<br>
That like an Hauke, which feeling her selfe freed<br>
From bels and iesses, which did let her flight,<br>
Him seem'd his feet did fly, and in their speed delight.<p>

So well he sped him, that the wearie Beare<br>
Ere long he ouertooke, and forst to stay,<br>
And without weapon him assayling neare,<br>
Compeld him soone the spoyle adowne to lay.<br>
Wherewith the beast enrag'd to loose his pray,<br>
Vpon him turned, and with greedie force<br>
And furie, to be crossed in his way,<br>
Gaping full wyde, did thinke without remorse<br>
To be aueng'd on him, and to deuoure his corse.<p>

But the bold knight no whit thereat dismayd,<br>
But catching vp in hand a ragged stone,<br>
Which lay thereby (so fortune him did ayde)<br>
Vpon him ran, and thrust it all attone<br>
Into his gaping throte, that made him grone<br>
And gaspe for breath, that he nigh choked was,<br>
Being vnable to digest that bone;<br>
Ne could it vpward come, nor downward passe,<br>
Ne could he brooke the coldnesse of the stony masse.<p>

Whom when as he thus combred did behold,<br>
Stryuing in vaine that nigh his bowels brast,<br>
He with him closd, and laying mightie hold<br>
Vpon his throte, did gripe his gorge so fast,<br>
That wanting breath, him downe to ground he cast;<br>
And then oppressing him with vrgent paine,<br>
Ere long enforst to breath his vtmost blast,<br>
Gnashing his cruell teeth at him in vaine,<br>
And threatning his sharpe clawes, now wanting powre to straine.<p>

Then tooke he vp betwixt his armes twaine<br>
The litle babe, sweet relickes of his pray;<br>
Whom pitying to heare so sore complaine,<br>
From his soft eyes the teares he wypt away,<br>
And from his face the filth that did it ray,<br>
And euery litle limbe he searcht around,<br>
And euery part, that vnder sweathbands lay,<br>
Least that the beasts sharpe teeth had any wound<br>
Made in his tender flesh, but whole them all he found.<p>

So hauing all his bands againe vptyde,<br>
He with him thought backe to returne againe:<br>
But when he lookt about on euery syde,<br>
To weet which way were best to entertaine,<br>
To bring him to the place, where he would faine,<br>
He could no path nor tract of foot descry,<br>
Ne by inquirie learne, nor ghesse by ayme.<br>
For nought but woods and forrests farre and nye,<br>
That all about did close the compasse of his eye.<p>

Much was he then encombred, ne could tell<br>
Which way to take: now West he went a while,<br>
Then North; then neither, but as fortune fell.<br>
So vp and downe he wandred many a mile,<br>
With wearie trauell and vncertaine toile,<br>
Yet nought the nearer to his iourneys end;<br>
And euermore his louely litle spoile<br>
Crying for food, did greatly him offend.<br>
So all that day in wandring vainely he did spend.<p>

At last about the setting of the Sunne,<br>
Him selfe out of the forest he did wynd,<br>
And by good fortune the plaine champion wonne:<br>
Where looking all about, where he mote fynd<br>
Some place of succour to content his mynd,<br>
At length he heard vnder the forrests syde<br>
A voice, that seemed of some woman kynd,<br>
Which to her selfe lamenting loudly cryde,<br>
And oft complayn'd of fate, and Fortune oft defyde.<p>

To whom approching, when as she perceiued<br>
A stranger wight in place, her plaint she stayd,<br>
As if she doubted to haue bene deceiued,<br>
Or loth to let her sorrowes be bewrayd.<br>
Whom when as <i>Calepine</i> saw so dismayd,<br>
He to her drew, and with faire blandishment<br>
Her chearing vp, thus gently to her sayd;<br>
What be you wofull Dame, which thus lament,<br>
And for what cause declare, so mote ye not repent?<p>

To whom she thus, What need me Sir to tell,<br>
That which your selfe haue earst ared so right?<br>
A wofull dame ye haue me termed well;<br>
So much more wofull, as my wofull plight<br>
Cannot redressed be by liuing wight.<br>
Nathlesse (quoth he) if need doe not you bynd,<br>
Doe it disclose, to ease your grieued spright:<br>
Oftimes it haps, that sorrowes of the mynd<br>
Find remedie vnsought, which seeking cannot fynd.<p>

Then thus began the lamentable Dame;<br>
Sith then ye needs will know the griefe I hoord,<br>
I am th'vnfortunate <i>Matilde</i> by name,<br>
The wife of bold Sir <i>Bruin</i>, who is Lord<br>
Of all this land, late conquer'd by his sword<br>
From a great Gyant, called <i>Cormoraunt</i>;<br>
Whom he did ouerthrow by yonder foord,<br>
And in three battailes did so deadly daunt,<br>
That he dare not returne for all his daily vaunt.<p>

So is my Lord now seiz'd of all the land,<br>
As in his fee, with peaceable estate,<br>
And quietly doth hold it in his hand,<br>
Ne any dares with him for it debate.<br>
But to these happie fortunes, cruell Fate<br>
Hath ioyn'd one euill, which doth ouerthrow<br>
All these our ioyes, and all our blisse abate;<br>
And like in time to further ill to grow,<br>
And all this land with endlesse losse to ouerflow.<p>

For th'heauens enuying our prosperitie,<br>
Haue not vouchsaft to graunt vnto vs twaine<br>
The gladfull blessing of posteritie,<br>
Which we might see after our selues remaine<br>
In th'heritage of our vnhappie paine:<br>
So that for want of heires it to defend,<br>
All is in time like to returne againe<br>
To that foule feend, who dayly doth attend<br>
To leape into the same after our liues end.<p>

But most my Lord is grieued herewithall,<br>
And makes exceeding mone, when he does thinke<br>
That all this land vnto his foe shall fall,<br>
For which he long in vaine did sweat and swinke,<br>
That now the same he greatly doth forthinke.<br>
Yet was it sayd, there should to him a sonne<br>
<i>Be gotten</i>, <i>not begotten</i>, which should drinke<br>
And dry vp all the water, which doth ronne<br>
In the next brooke, by wh&otilde; that feend shold be fordonne.<p>

Well hop't he then, when this was propheside,<br>
That from his sides some noble chyld should rize,<br>
The which through fame should farre be magnifide,<br>
And this proud gyant should with braue emprize<br>
Quite ouerthrow, who now ginnes to despize<br>
The good Sir <i>Bruin</i>, growing farre in yeares;<br>
Who thinkes from me his sorrow all doth rize.<br>
Lo this my cause of griefe to you appeares;<br>
For which I thus doe mourne, and poure forth ceaselesse teares.<p>

Which when he heard, he inly touched was<br>
With tender ruth for her vnworthy griefe:<br>
And when he had deuized of her case,<br>
He gan in mind conceiue a fit reliefe<br>
For all her paine, if please her make the priefe.<br>
And hauing cheared her, thus said; faire Dame,<br>
In euils counsell is the comfort chiefe,<br>
Which though I be not wise enough to frame,<br>
Yet as I well it meane, vouchsafe it without blame.<p>

If that the cause of this your languishment<br>
Be lacke of children, to supply your place,<br>
Lo how good fortune doth to you present<br>
This litle babe, of sweete and louely face,<br>
And spotlesse spirit, in which ye may enchace<br>
What euer formes ye list thereto apply,<br>
Being now soft and fit them to embrace;<br>
Whether ye list him traine in cheualry,<br>
Or noursle vp in lore of learn'd Philosophy.<p>

And certes it hath oftentimes bene seene,<br>
That of the like, whose linage was vnknowne,<br>
More braue and noble knights haue raysed beene,<br>
As their victorious deedes haue often showen,<br>
Being with fame through many Nations blowen,<br>
Then those, which haue bene dandled in the lap.<br>
Therefore some thought, that those braue imps were sowen<br>
Here by the Gods, and fed with heauenly sap,<br>
That made them grow so high t'all honorable hap.<p>

The Ladie hearkning to his sensefull speach,<br>
Found nothing that he said, vnmeet nor geason,<br>
Hauing oft seene it tryde, as he did teach.<br>
Therefore inclyning to his goodly reason,<br>
Agreeing well both with the place and season,<br>
She gladly did of that same babe accept,<br>
As of her owne by liuerey and seisin,<br>
And hauing ouer it a litle wept,<br>
She bore it thence, and euer as her owne it kept.<p>

Right glad was <i>Calepine</i> to be so rid<br>
Of his young charge, whereof he skilled nought:<br>
Ne she lesse glad; for she so wisely did,<br>
And with her husband vnder hand so wrought,<br>
That when that infant vnto him she brought,<br>
She made him thinke it surely was his owne,<br>
And it in goodly thewes so well vpbrought,<br>
That it became a famous knight well knowne,<br>
And did right noble deedes, the which elswhere are showne.<p>

But <i>Calepine</i>, now being left alone<br>
Vnder the greenewoods side in sorie plight,<br>
Withouten armes or steede to ride vpon,<br>
Or house to hide his head from heauens spight,<br>
Albe that Dame by all the meanes she might,<br>
Him oft desired home with her to wend,<br>
And offred him, his courtesie to requite,<br>
Both horse and armes, and what so else to lend,<br>
Yet he them all refusd, though thankt her as a frend.<p>

And for exceeding griefe which inly grew,<br>
That he his loue so lucklesse now had lost,<br>
On the cold ground, maugre himselfe he threw,<br>
For fell despight, to be so sorely crost;<br>
And there all night himselfe in anguish tost,<br>
Vowing, that neuer he in bed againe<br>
His limbes would rest, ne lig in ease embost,<br>
Till that his Ladies sight he mote attaine,<br>
Or vnderstand, that she in safetie did remaine.<p>
