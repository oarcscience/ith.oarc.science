*Cant. XI.*

> *Britomart chaceth Ollyphant,  
> findes Scudamour distrest:  
> Assayes the house of Busyrane,  
> where Loues spoyles are exprest.*

> O Hatefull hellish Snake, what furie furst  
> Brought thee from balefull house of *Proserpine*,  
> Where in her bosome she thee long had nurst,  
> And fostred vp with bitter milke of tine,  
> Fowle Gealosie, that turnest loue diuine  
> To ioylesse dread, and mak'st the louing hart  
> With hatefull thoughts to languish and to pine,  
> And feed it selfe with selfe-consuming smart?  
> Of all the passions in the mind thou vilest art.
>
> O let him far be banished away,  
> And in his stead let Loue for euer dwell,  
> Sweet Loue, that doth his golding wings embay  
> In blessed Nectar, and pure Pleasures well,  
> Vntroubled of vile feare, or bitter fell.  
> And ye faire Ladies, that your kingdomes make  
> In th'harts of men, them gouerne wisely well,  
> And of faire *Britomart* ensample take,  
> That was as trew in loue, as Turtle to her make.
>
> Who with Sir *Satyrane*, as earst ye red,  
> Forth ryding from *Malbeccoes* hostlesse hous,  
> Far off aspyde a young man, the which fled  
> From an huge Geaunt, that with hideous  
> And hatefull outrage long him chaced thus;  
> It was that *Ollyphant*, the brother deare  
> Of that *Argante* vile and vitious,  
> From whom the *Squire of Dames* was reft whylere;  
> This all as bad as she, and worse, if worse ought were.
>
> For as the sister did in feminine  
> And filthy lust exceede all woman kind,  
> So he surpassed his sex masculine,  
> In beastly vse that I did euer find;  
> Whom when as *Britomart* beheld behind  
> The fearefull boy so greedily pursew,  
> She was emmoued in her noble mind,  
> T'employ her puissaunce to his reskew,  
> And pricked fiercely forward, where she him did vew.
>
> Ne was Sir *Satyrane* her far behinde,  
> But with like fiercenesse did ensew the chace:  
> Whom when the Gyaunt saw, he soone resinde  
> His former suit, and from them fled apace;  
> They after both, and boldly bad him bace,  
> And each did striue the other to out-goe,  
> But he them both outran a wondrous space,  
> For he was long, and swift as any Roe,  
> And now made better speed, t'escape his feared foe.
>
> It was not *Satyrane*, whom he did feare,  
> But *Britomart* the flowre of chastity;  
> For he the powre of chast hands might not beare,  
> But alwayes did their dread encounter fly:  
> And now so fast his feet he did apply,  
> That he has gotten to a forrest neare,  
> Where he is shrowded in security.  
> The wood they enter, and search euery where,  
> They searched diuersely, so both diuided were.
>
> Faire *Britomart* so long him followed,  
> That she at last came to a fountaine sheare,  
> By which there lay a knight all wallowed  
> Vpon the grassy ground, and by him neare  
> His haberieon, his helmet, and his speare;  
> A little off, his shield was rudely throwne,  
> On which the winged boy in colours cleare  
> Depeincted was, full easie to be knowne,  
> And he thereby, where euer it in field was showne.
>
> His face vpon the ground did groueling ly,  
> As if he had bene slombring in the shade,  
> That the braue Mayd would not for courtesy,  
> Out of his quiet slomber him abrade,  
> Nor seeme too suddeinly him to inuade:  
> Still as she stood, she heard with grieuous throb  
> Him grone, as if his hart were peeces made,  
> And with most painefull pangs to sigh and sob,  
> That pitty did the Virgins hart of patience rob.
>
> At last forth breaking into bitter plaintes  
> He said; ô soueraigne Lord that sit'st on hye,  
> And raignst in blis emongst thy blessed Saintes,  
> How suffrest thou such shamefull cruelty,  
> So long vnwreaked of thine enimy?  
> Or hast thou, Lord, of good mens cause no heed?  
> Or doth thy iustice sleepe, and silent ly?  
> What booteth then the good and righteous deed,  
> If goodnesse find no grace, nor righteousnesse no meed?
>
> If good find grace, and righteousnesse reward,  
> Why then is *Amoret* in caytiue band,  
> Sith that more bounteous creature neuer far'd  
> On foot, vpon the face of liuing land?  
> Or if that heauenly iustice may withstand  
> The wrongfull outrage of vnrighteous men,  
> Why then is *Busirane* with wicked hand  
> Suffred, these seuen monethes day in secret den  
> My Lady and my loue so cruelly to pen?
>
> My Lady and my loue is cruelly pend  
> In dolefull darkenesse from the vew of day,  
> Whilest deadly torments do her chast brest rend,  
> And the sharpe steele doth riue her hart in tway,  
> All for she *Scudamore* will not denay.  
> Yet thou vile man, vile *Scudamore* art sound,  
> Ne canst her ayde, ne canst her foe dismay:  
> Vnworthy wretch to tread vpon the ground,  
> For whom so faire a Lady feeles so sore a wound.
>
> There an huge heape of singulfes did oppresse  
> His strugling soule, and swelling throbs empeach  
> His foltring toung with pangs of drerinesse,  
> Choking the remnant of his plaintife speach,  
> As if his dayes were come to their last reach.  
> Which when she heard, and saw the ghastly fit,  
> Threatning into his life to make a breach,  
> Both with great ruth and terrour she was smit,  
> Fearing least from her cage the wearie soule would flit.
>
> Tho stooping downe she him amoued light;  
> Who therewith somewhat starting, vp gan looke,  
> And seeing him behind a straunger knight,  
> Whereas no liuing creature he mistooke,  
> With great indignaunce he that sight forsooke,  
> And downe againe himselfe disdainefully  
> Abiecting, th'earth with his faire forhead strooke:  
> Which the bold Virgin seeing, gan apply  
> Fit medcine to his griefe, and spake thus courtesly.
>
> Ah gentle knight, whose deepe conceiued griefe  
> Well seemes t'exceede the powre of patience,  
> Yet if that heauenly grace some good reliefe  
> You send, submit you to high prouidence,  
> And euer in your noble hart prepense,  
> That all the sorrow in the world is lesse,  
> Then vertues might, and values confidence,  
> For who nill bide the burden of distresse,  
> Must not here thinke to liue: for life is wretchednesse.
>
> Therefore, faire Sir, do comfort to you take,  
> And freely read, what wicked felon so  
> Hath outrag'd you, and thrald your gentle make.  
> Perhaps this hand may helpe to ease your woe,  
> And wreake your sorrow on your cruell foe,  
> At least it faire endeuour will apply.  
> Those feeling wordes so neare the quicke did goe,  
> That vp his head he reared easily,  
> And leaning on his elbow, these few wordes let fly.
>
> What boots it plaine, that cannot be redrest,  
> And sow vaine sorrow in a fruitlesse eare,  
> Sith powre of hand, nor skill of learned brest,  
> Ne worldly price cannot redeeme my deare,  
> Out of her thraldome and continuall feare?  
> For he the tyraunt, which her hath in ward  
> By strong enchauntments and blacke Magicke leare,  
> Hath in a dungeon deepe her close embard,  
> And many dreadfull feends hath pointed to her gard.
>
> There he tormenteth her most terribly,  
> And day and night afflicts with mortall paine,  
> Because to yield him loue she doth deny,  
> Once to me yold, not to be yold againe:  
> But yet by torture he would her constraine  
> Loue to conceiue in her disdainfull brest;  
> Till so she do, she must in doole remaine,  
> Ne may by liuing meanes be thence relest:  
> What boots it then to plaine, that cannot be redrest?
>
> With this sad hersall of his heauy stresse,  
> The warlike Damzell was empassiond sore,  
> And said; Sir knight, your cause is nothing lesse,  
> Then is your sorrow, certes if not more;  
> For nothing so much pitty doth implore,  
> As gentle Ladies helplesse misery.  
> But yet, if please ye listen to my lore,  
> I will with proofe of last extremity,  
> Deliuer her fro thence, or with her for you dy.
>
> Ah gentlest knight aliue, (said *Scudamore*)  
> What huge heroicke magnanimity  
> Dwels in thy bounteous brest? what couldst thou more,  
> If she were thine, and thou as now am I?  
> O spare thy happy dayes, and them apply  
> To better boot, but let me dye, that ought;  
> More is more losse: one is enough to dy.  
> Life is not lost, (said she) for which is bought  
> Endlesse renowm, that more then death is to be sought.
>
> Thus she at length perswaded him to rise,  
> And with her wend, to see what new successe  
> Mote him befall vpon new enterprise;  
> His armes, which he had vowed to disprofesse,  
> She gathered vp and did about him dresse,  
> And his forwandred steed vnto him got:  
> So forth they both yfere make their progresse,  
> And march not past the mountenaunce of a shot.  
> Till they arriu'd, whereas their purpose they did plot.
>
> There they dismounting, drew their weapons bold  
> And stoutly came vnto the Castle gate;  
> Whereas no gate they found, them to withhold,  
> Nor ward to wait at morne and euening late,  
> But in the Porch, that did them sore amate,  
> A flaming fire, ymixt with smouldry smoke,  
> And stinking Sulphure, that with griesly hate  
> And dreadfull horrour did all entraunce choke,  
> Enforced them their forward footing to reuoke.
>
> Greatly thereat was *Britomart* dismayd,  
> Ne in that stownd wist, how her selfe to beare;  
> For daunger vaine it were, to haue assayd  
> That cruell element, which all things feare,  
> Ne none can suffer to approchen neare:  
> And turning backe to *Scudamour*, thus sayd;  
> What monstrous enmity prouoke we heare,  
> Foolhardy as th'Earthes children, the which made  
> Battell against the Gods? so we a God inuade.
>
> Daunger without discretion to attempt,  
> Inglorious and beastlike is: therefore Sir knight,  
> Aread what course of you is safest dempt,  
> And how we with our foe may come to fight.  
> This is (quoth he) the dolorous despight,  
> Which earst to you I playnd: for neither may  
> This fire be quencht by any wit or might,  
> Ne yet by any meanes remou'd away,  
> So mighty be th'enchauntments, which the same do stay.
>
> What is there else, but cease these fruitlesse paines,  
> And leaue me to my former languishing;  
> Faire *Amoret* must dwell in wicked chaines,  
> And *Scudamore* here dye with sorrowing.  
> Perdy not so; (said she) for shamefull thing  
> It were t'abandon noble cheuisaunce,  
> For shew of perill, without venturing:  
> Rather let try extremities of chaunce,  
> Then enterprised prayse for dread to disauaunce.
>
> Therewith resolu'd to proue her vtmost might,  
> Her ample shield she threw before her face,  
> And her swords point directing forward right,  
> Assayld the flame, the which eftsoones gaue place,  
> And did it selfe diuide with equall space,  
> That through she passed; as a thunder bolt  
> Perceth the yielding ayre, and doth displace  
> The soring clouds into sad showres ymolt;  
> So to her yold the flames, and did their force reuolt,
>
> Whom whenas *Scudamour* saw past the fire,  
> Safe and vntoucht, he likewise gan assay,  
> With greedy will, and enuious desire,  
> And bad the stubborne flames to yield him way:  
> But cruell *Mulciber* would not obay  
> His threatfull pride, but did the more augment  
> His mighty rage, and with imperious sway  
> Him forst (maulgre) his fiercenesse to relent,  
> And backe retire, all scorcht and pitifully brent.
>
> With huge impatience he inly swelt,  
> More for great sorrow, that he could not pas,  
> Then for the burning torment, which he felt,  
> That with fell woodnesse he effierced was,  
> And wilfully him throwing on the gras,  
> Did beat and bounse his head and brest full sore;  
> The whiles the Championesse now entred has  
> The vtmost rowme, and past the formest dore,  
> The vtmost rowme, abounding with all precious store.
>
> For round about, the wals yclothed were  
> With goodly arras of great maiesty,  
> Wouen with gold and silke so close and nere,  
> That the rich metall lurked priuily,  
> As faining to be hid from enuious eye;  
> Yet here, and there, and euery where vnwares  
> It shewd it selfe, and shone vnwillingly;  
> Like a discolourd Snake, whose hidden snares  
> Through the greene gras his long bright burnisht backe declares.
>
> And in those Tapets weren fashioned  
> Many faire pourtraicts, and many a faire feate,  
> And all of loue, and all of lusty-hed,  
> As seemed by their semblaunt did entreat;  
> And eke all *Cupids* warres they did repeate,  
> And cruell battels, which he whilome fought  
> Gainst all the Gods, to make his empire great;  
> Besides the huge massacres, which he wrought  
> On mighty kings and kesars, into thraldome brought.
>
> Therein was writ, how often thundring *Ioue*  
> Had felt the point of his hart-percing dart,  
> And leauing heauens kingdome, here did roue  
> In straunge disguize, to slake his scalding smart;  
> Now like a Ram, faire *Helle* to peruart,  
> Now like a Bull, *Europa* to withdraw:  
> Ah, how the fearefull Ladies tender hart  
> Did liuely seeme to tremble, wheh she saw  
> The huge seas vnder her t'obay her seruaunts law.
>
> Soone after that into a golden showre  
> Him selfe he chaung'd faire *Danaë* to vew,  
> And through the roofe of her strong brasen towre  
> Did raine into her lap an hony dew,  
> The whiles her foolish garde, that little knew  
> Of such deceipt, kept th'yron dore fast bard,  
> And watcht, that none should enter nor issew;  
> Vaine was the watch, and bootlesse all the ward,  
> Whenas the God to golden hew him selfe transfard.
>
> Then was he turnd into a snowy Swan,  
> To win faire *Leda* to his louely trade:  
> O wondrous skill, and sweet wit of the man,  
> That her in daffadillies sleeping made,  
> From scorching heat her daintie limbes to shade:  
> Whiles the proud Bird ruffing his fethers wyde,  
> And brushing his faire brest, did her inuade;  
> She slept, yet twixt her eyelids closely spyde,  
> How towards her he rusht, and smiled at his pryde.
>
> Then shewd it, how the *Thebane Semelee*  
> Deceiu'd of gealous *Iuno*, did require  
> To see him in his soueraigne maiestee,  
> Armd with his thunderbolts and lightning fire,  
> Whence dearely she with death bought her desire.  
> But faire *Alcmena* better match did make,  
> Ioying his loue in likenesse more entire;  
> Three nights in one, they say, that for her sake  
> He then did put, her pleasures lenger to partake.
>
> Twise was he seene in soaring Eagles shape,  
> And with wide wings to beat the buxome ayre,  
> Once, when he with *Asterie* did scape,  
> Againe, when as the *Troiane* boy so faire  
> He snatcht from *Ida* hill, and with him bare:  
> Wondrous delight it was, there to behould,  
> How the rude Shepheards after him did stare,  
> Trembling through feare, least down he fallen should,  
> And often to him calling, to take surer hould.
>
> In *Satyres* shape *Antiopa* he snatcht:  
> And like a fire, when he *Aegin'* assayd:  
> A shepheard, when *Mnemosyne* he catcht:  
> And like a Serpent to the *Thracian* mayd.  
> Whiles thus on earth great *Ioue* these pageaunts playd,  
> The winged boy did thrust into his throne,  
> And scoffing, thus vnto his mother sayd,  
> Lo now the heauens obey to me alone,  
> And take me for their *Ioue*, whiles *Ioue* to earth is gone.
>
> And thou, faire *Phoebus*, in thy colours bright  
> Wast there enwouen, and the sad distresse,  
> In which that boy thee plonged, for despight,  
> That thou bewray'dst his mothers wantonnesse,  
> When she with *Mars* was meynt in ioyfulnesse:  
> For thy, he thrild thee with a leaden dart,  
> To loue faire *Daphne*, which thee loued lesse:  
> Lesse she thee lou'd, then was thy iust desart,  
> Yet was thy loue her death, & her death was thy smart.
>
> So louedst thou the lusty *Hyacinct*,  
> So louedst thou the faire *Coronis* deare:  
> Yet both are of thy haplesse hand extinct,  
> Yet both in flowres do liue, and loue thee beare,  
> The one a Paunce, the other a sweet breare:  
> For griefe whereof, ye mote haue liuely seene  
> The God himselfe rending his golden heare,  
> And breaking quite his gyrlond euer greene,  
> With other signes of sorrow and impatient teene.
>
> Both for those two, and for his owne deare sonne,  
> The sonne of *Climene* he did repent,  
> Who bold to guide the charet of the Sunne,  
> Himselfe in thousand peeces fondly rent,  
> And all the world with flashing fier brent;  
> So like, that all the walles did seeme to flame.  
> Yet cruell *Cupid*, not herewith content,  
> Forst him eftsoones to follow other game,  
> And loue a Shepheards daughter for his dearest Dame.
>
> He loued *Isse* for his dear est Dame,  
> And for her sake her cattell fed a while,  
> And for her sake a cowheard vile became,  
> The seruant of *Admetus* cowheard vile,  
> Whiles that from heauen he suffered exile.  
> Long were to tell each other louely fit,  
> Now like a Lyon, hunting after spoile,  
> Now like a Stag, now like a faulcon flit:  
> All which in that faire arras was most liuely writ.
>
> Next vnto him was *Neptune* pictured,  
> In his diuine resemblance wondrous lyke:  
> His face was rugged, and his hoarie hed  
> Dropped with brackish deaw; his three-forkt Pyke  
> He stearnly shooke, and therewith fierce did stryke  
> The raging billowes, that on euery syde  
> They trembling stood, and made a long broad dyke,  
> That his swift charet might haue passage wyde,  
> Which foure great *Hippodames* did draw in temewise tyde.
>
> His sea-horses did seeme to sport amayne,  
> And from their nosethrilles blow the brynie streame,  
> That made the sparckling waues to smoke agayne,  
> And flame with gold, but the white fomy creame,  
> Did shine with siluer, and shoot forth his beame.  
> The God himselfe did pensiue seeme and sad,  
> And hong adowne his head, as he did dreame:  
> For priuy loue his brest empierced had,  
> Ne ought but deare *Bisaltis* ay could make him glad.
>
> He loued eke *Iphimedia* deare,  
> And *Aeolus* faire daughter *Arne* hight.  
> For whom he turnd him selfe into a Steare,  
> And fed on fodder, to beguile her sight.  
> Also to win *Deucalions* daughter bright,  
> He turnd him selfe into a Dolphin fayre;  
> And like a winged horse he tooke his flight,  
> To snaky-locke *Medusa* to repayre,  
> On whom he got faire *Pegasus*, that flitteth in the ayre.
>
> Next *Saturne* was, (but who would euer weene,  
> That sullein *Saturne* euer weend to loue?  
> Yet loue is sullein, and *Saturnlike* seene,  
> As he did for *Erigone* it proue,)  
> That to a *Centaure* did him selfe transmoue.  
> So proou'd it eke that gracious God of wine,  
> When for to compasse *Philliras* hard loue,  
> He turnd himselfe into a fruitfull vine,  
> And into her faire bosome made his grapes decline.
>
> Long were to tell the amorous assayes,  
> And gentle pangues, with which he maked meeke  
> The mighty *Mars*, to learne his wanton playes:  
> How oft for *Venus*, and how often eek  
> For many other Nymphes he sore did shreek,  
> With womanish teares, and with vnwarlike smarts,  
> Priuily moystening his horrid cheek.  
> There was he painted full of burning darts,  
> And many wide woundes launched through his inner parts.
>
> Ne did he spare (so cruell was the Elfe)  
> His owne deare mother, (ah why should he so?)  
> Ne did he spare sometime to pricke himselfe,  
> That he might taste the sweet consuming woe,  
> Which he had wrought to many others moe.  
> But to declare the mournfull Tragedyes,  
> And spoiles, wherewith he all the ground did strow,  
> More eath to number, with how many eyes  
> High heauen beholds sad louers nightly theeueryes.
>
> Kings Queenes, Lords Ladies, Knights & Damzels gent  
> Were heap'd together with the vulgar sort,  
> And mingled with the raskall rablement,  
> Without respect of person or of port,  
> To shew Dan *Cupids* powre and great effort:  
> And round about a border was entrayld,  
> Of broken bowes and arrowes shiuered short,  
> And a long bloudy riuer through them rayld,  
> So liuely and so like, that liuing sence it fayld.
>
> And at the vpper end of that faire rowme,  
> There was an Altar built of pretious stone,  
> Of passing valew, and of great renowme,  
> On which there stood an Image all alone,  
> Of massy gold, which with his owne light shone;  
> And wings it had with sundry colours dight,  
> More sundry colours, then the proud *Pauone*  
> Beares in his boasted fan, or *Iris* bright,  
> When her discolourd bow she spreds through heauens hight.
>
> Blindfold he was, and in his cruell fist  
> A mortall bow and arrowes keene did hold,  
> With which he shot at randon, when him list,  
> Some headed with sad lead, some with pure gold;  
> (Ah man beware, how thou those darts behold)  
> A wounded Dragon vnder him did ly,  
> Whose hideous tayle his left foot did enfold,  
> And with a shaft was shot through either eye,  
> That no man forth might draw, ne no man remedye.
>
> And vnderneath his feet was written thus,  
> *Vnto the Victor of the Gods this bee:*  
> And all the people in that ample hous  
> Did to that image bow their humble knee,  
> And oft committed fowle Idolatree.  
> That wondrous sight faire *Britomart* amazed,  
> Ne seeing could her wonder satisfie,  
> But euermore and more vpon it gazed,  
> The whiles the passing brightnes her fraile sences dazed.
>
> Tho as she backward cast her busie eye,  
> To search each secret of that goodly sted,  
> Ouer the dore thus written she did spye  
> *Be bold*: she oft and oft it ouer-red,  
> Yet could not find what sence it figured:  
> But what so were therein or writ or ment,  
> She was no whit thereby discouraged  
> From prosecuting of her first intent,  
> But forward with bold steps into the next roome went.
>
> Much fairer, then the former, was that roome,  
> And richlier by many partes arayd:  
> For not with arras made in painefull loome,  
> But with pure gold it all was ouerlayd,  
> Wrought with wilde Antickes, which their follies playd,  
> In the rich metall, as they liuing were:  
> A thousand monstrous formes therein were made,  
> Such as false loue doth oft vpon him weare:  
> For loue in thousand monstrous formes doth oft appeare.
>
> And all about, the glistring walles were hong  
> With warlike spoiles, and with victorious prayes,  
> Of mighty Conquerours and Captaines strong,  
> Which were whilome captiued in their dayes  
> To cruell loue, and wrought their owne decayes:  
> Their swerds & speres were broke, & hauberques rent;  
> And their proud girlonds of tryumphant bayes  
> Troden in dust with fury insolent,  
> To shew the victors might and mercilesse intent.
>
> The warlike Mayde beholding earnestly  
> The goodly ordinance of this rich place,  
> Did greatly wonder, ne could satisfie  
> Her greedy eyes with gazing a long space:  
> But more she meruaild that no footings trace,  
> Nor wight appear'd, but wastefull emptinesse,  
> And solemne silence ouer all that place:  
> Straunge thing it seem'd, that none was to possesse  
> So rich purueyance, ne them keepe with carefulnesse.
>
> And as she lookt about, she did behold,  
> How ouer that same dore was likewise writ,  
> *Be bold*, *be bold*, and euery where *Be bold*,  
> That much she muz'd, yet could not construe it  
> By any ridling skill, or commune wit.  
> At last she spyde at that roomes vpper end,  
> Another yron dore, on which was writ,  
> *Be not too bold*; whereto though she did bend  
> Her earnest mind, yet wist not what it might intend.
>
> Thus she there waited vntill euentyde,  
> Yet liuing creature none she saw appeare:  
> And now sad shadowes gan the world to hyde,  
> From mortall vew, and wrap in darkenesse dreare;  
> Yet nould she d'off her weary armes, for feare  
> Of secret daunger, ne let sleepe oppresse  
> Her heauy eyes with natures burdein deare,  
> But drew her selfe aside in sickernesse,  
> And her welpointed weapons did about her dresse.
