 THE LEGEND OF ARTEGALL<P>

OF IVSTICE.

<blockquote>
SO oft as I with state of present time,<br>
The image of the antique world compare,<br>
When as mans age was in his freshest prime,<br>
And the first blossome of faire vertue bare,<br>
Such oddes I finde twixt those, and these which are,<br>
As that, through long continuance of his course,<br>
Me seemes the world is runne quite out of square,<br>
From the first point of his appointed sourse,<br>
And being once amisse growes daily wourse and wourse.<p>

For from the golden age, that first was named,<br>
It's now at earst become a stonie one;<br>
And men themselues, the which at first were framed<br>
Of earthly mould, and form'd of flesh and bone,<br>
Are now transformed into hardest stone:<br>
Such as behind their backs (so backward bred)<br>
Were throwne by <i>Pyrrha</i> and <i>Deucalione</i>:<br>
And if then those may any worse be red,<br>
They into that ere long will be degendered.<p>

Let none then blame me, if in discipline<br>
Of vertue and of ciuill vses lore,<br>
I doe not forme them to the common line<br>
Of present dayes, which are corrupted sore,<br>
But to the antique vse, which was of yore,<br>
When good was onely for it selfe desyred,<br>
And all men sought their owne, and none no more;<br>
When Iustice was not for most meed outhyred,<br>
But simple Truth did rayne, and was of all admyred.<p>

For that which all men then did vertue call,<br>
Is now cald vice; and that which vice was hight,<br>
Is now hight vertue, and so vs'd of all:<br>
Right now is wrong, and wrong that was is right,<br>
As all things else in time are chaunged quight.<br>
Ne wonder; for the heauens reuolution<br>
Is wandred farre from where it first was pight,<br>
And so doe make contrarie constitution<br>
Of all this lower world, toward his dissolution.<p>

For who so list into the heauens looke,<br>
And search the courses of the rowling spheares,<br>
Shall find that from the point, where they first tooke<br>
Their setting forth, in these few thousand yeares<br>
They all are wandred much; that plaine appeares.<br>
For that same golden fleecy Ram, which bore<br>
<i>Phrixus</i> and <i>Helle</i> from their stepdames feares,<br>
Hath now forgot, where he was plast of yore,<br>
And shouldred hath the Bull, which fayre <i>Europa</i> bore.<p>

And eke the Bull hath with his bow-bent horne<br>
So hardly butted those two twinnes of <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
That they haue crusht the Crab, and quite him borne<br>
Into the great <i>Nemoean</i> lions groue.<br>
So now all range, and doe at randon roue<br>
Out of their proper places farre away,<br>
And all this world with them amisse doe moue,<br>
And all his creatures from their course astray,<br>
Till they arriue at their last ruinous decay.<p>

Ne is that same great glorious lampe of light,<br>
That doth enlumine all these lesser fyres,<br>
In better case, ne keepes his course more right,<br>
But is miscaried with the other Spheres.<br>
For since the terme of fourteene hundred fyeres,<br>
That learned <i>Ptolomaee</i> his hight did take,<br>
He is declyned from that marke of theirs,<br>
Nigh thirtie minutes to the Southerne lake;<br>
That makes me feare in time he will vs quite forsake.<p>

And if to those <i>&AElig;gyptian</i> wisards old,<br>
Which in Star-read were wont haue best insight,<br>
Faith may be giuen, it is by them told,<br>
That since the time they first tooke the Sunnes hight,<br>
Foure times his place he shifted hath in sight,<br>
And twice hath risen, where he now doth West,<br>
And wested twice, where he ought rise aright.<br>
But most is <i>Mars</i> amisse of all the rest,<br>
And next to him old <i>Saturne</i>, that was wont be best.<p>

For during <i>Saturnes</i> ancient raigne it's sayd,<br>
That all the world with goodnesse did abound:<br>
All loued vertue, no man was affrayd<br>
Of force, ne fraud in wight was to be found:<br>
No warre was knowne, no dreadfull trompets sound,<br>
Peace vniuersall rayn'd mongst men and beasts,<br>
And all things freely grew out of the ground:<br>
Iustice sate high ador'd with solemne feasts,<br>
And to all people did diuide her dred beheasts.<p>

Most sacred vertue she of all the rest,<br>
Resembling God in his imperiall might;<br>
Whose soueraine powre is herein most exprest,<br>
That both to good and bad he dealeth right,<br>
And all his workes with Iustice hath bedight.<br>
That powre he also doth to Princes lend,<br>
And makes them like himselfe in glorious sight,<br>
To sit in his owne seate, his cause to end,<br>
And rule his people right, as he doth recommend.<p>

Dread Souerayne Goddesse, that doest highest sit<br>
In seate of iudgement, in th'Almighties stead,<br>
And with magnificke might and wondrous wit<br>
Doest to thy people righteous doome aread,<br>
That furthest Nations filles with awfull dread,<br>
Pardon the boldnesse of thy basest thrall,<br>
That dare discourse of so diuine a read,<br>
As thy great iustice praysed ouer all:<br>
The instrument whereof loe here thy <i>Artegall</i>.<p>
