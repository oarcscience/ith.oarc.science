*Cant. VII.*

> *Guyon findes Mammon in a delue,  
> Sunning his threasure hore:  
> Is by him tempted, & led downe,  
> To see his secret store.*

> A S Pilot well expert in perilous waue,  
> That to a stedfast starre his course hath bent,  
> When foggy mistes, or cloudy tempests haue  
> The faithfull light of that faire lampe yblent,  
> And couer'd heauen with hideous dreriment,  
> Vpon his card and compas firmes his eye,  
> The maisters of his long experiment,  
> And to them does the steddy helme apply,  
> Bidding his winged vessell fairely forward fly.
>
> So *Guyon* hauing lost his trusty guide,  
> Late left beyond that *Ydle lake*, proceedes  
> Yet on his way, of none accompanide;  
> And euermore himselfe with comfort feedes,  
> Of his owne vertues, and prayse-worthy deedes.  
> So long he yode, yet no aduenture found,  
> Which fame of her shrill trompet worthy reedes:  
> For still he traueild through wide wastfull ground,  
> That nought but desert wildernesse shew'd all around.
>
> At last he came vnto a gloomy glade,  
> Couer'd with boughes & shrubs from heauens light,  
> Whereas he sitting found in secret shade  
> An vncouth, saluage, and vnciuile wight,  
> Of griesly hew, and fowle ill fauour'd sight;  
> His face with smoke was tand, and eyes were bleard,  
> His head and beard with sout were ill bedight,  
> His cole-blacke hands did seeme to haue beene seard  
> In smithes fire-spitting forge, and nayles like clawes appeard.
>
> His yron coate all ouergrowne with rust,  
> Was vnderneath enueloped with gold,  
> Whose glistring glosse darkned with filthy dust,  
> Well it appeared, to haue beene of old  
> A worke of rich entayle, and curious mould,  
> Wouen with antickes and wild Imagery:  
> And in his lap a masse of coyne he told,  
> And turned vpsidowne, to feede his eye  
> A couetous desire with his huge threasury.
>
> And round about him lay on euery side  
> Great heapes of gold, that neuer could be spent:  
> Of which some were rude owre, not purifide  
> Of *Mulcibers* deuouring element;  
> Some others were new driuen, and distent  
> Into great Ingoes, and to wedges square;  
> Some in round plates withouten moniment;  
> But most were stampt, and in their metall bare  
> The antique shapes of kings and kesars straunge & rare.
>
> Soone as he *Guyon* saw, in great affright  
> And hast he rose, for to remoue aside  
> Those pretious hils from straungers enuious sight,  
> And downe them poured through an hole full wide,  
> Into the hollow earth, them there to hide.  
> But *Guyon* lightly to him leaping, stayd  
> His hand, that trembled, as one terrifyde;  
> And though him selfe were at the sight dismayd,  
> Yet him perforce restraynd, and to him doubtfull sayd.
>
> What art thou man, (if man at all thou art)  
> That here in desert hast thine habitaunce,  
> And these rich heapes of wealth doest hide apart  
> From the worldes eye, and from her right vsaunce?  
> Thereat with staring eyes fixed askaunce,  
> In great disdaine, he answerd; Hardy Elfe,  
> That darest vew my direfull countenaunce,  
> I read thee rash, and heedlesse of thy selfe,  
> To trouble my still seate, and heapes of pretious pelfe.
>
> God of the world and worldlings I me call,  
> Great *Mammon*, greatest god below the skye,  
> That of my plenty poure out vnto all,  
> And vnto none my graces do enuye:  
> Riches, renowme, and principality,  
> Honour, estate, and all this worldes good,  
> For which men swinck and sweat incessantly,  
> Fro me do flow into an ample flood,  
> And in the hollow earth haue their eternall brood.
>
> Wherefore if me thou deigne to serue and sew,  
> At thy commaund lo all these mountaines bee;  
> Or if to thy great mind, or greedy vew  
> All these may not suffise, there shall to thee  
> Ten times so much be numbred francke and free.  
> *Mammon* (said he) thy godheades vaunt is vaine,  
> And idle offers of thy golden fee;  
> To them, that couet such eye-glutting gaine,  
> Proffer thy giftes, and fitter seruaunts entertaine.
>
> Me ill besits, that in der-doing armes,  
> And honours suit my vowed dayes do spend,  
> Vnto thy bounteous baytes, and pleasing charmes,  
> With which weake men thou witchest, to attend:  
> Regard of worldly mucke doth fowly blend,  
> And low abase the high heroicke spright,  
> That ioyes for crownes and kingdomes to contend;  
> Faire shields, gay steedes, bright armes be my delight:  
> Those be the riches fit for an aduent'rous knight.
>
> Vaine glorious Elfe (said he) doest not thou weet,  
> That money can thy wantes at will supply?  
> Sheilds, steeds, and armes, & all things for thee meet  
> It can puruay in twinckling of an eye;  
> And crownes and kingdomes to thee multiply.  
> Do not I kings create, and throw the crowne  
> Sometimes to him, that low in dust doth ly?  
> And him that raignd, into his rowme thrust downe,  
> And whom I lust, do heape with glory and renowne?
>
> All otherwise (said he) I riches read,  
> And deeme them roote of all disquietnesse;  
> First got with guile, and then preseru'd with dread,  
> And after spent with pride and lauishnesse,  
> Leauing behind them griefe and heauinesse.  
> Infinite mischiefes of them do arize,  
> Strife; and debate, bloudshed, and bitternesse,  
> Outrageous wrong, and hellish couetize,  
> That noble heart as great dishonour doth despize.
>
> Ne thine be kingdomes, ne the scepters thine;  
> But realmes and rulers thou doest both confound,  
> And loyall truth to treason doest incline;  
> Witnesse the guiltlesse bloud pourd oft on ground,  
> The crowned often slaine, the slayer cround,  
> The sacred Diademe in peeces rent,  
> And purple robe gored with many a wound;  
> Castles surprizd, great cities sackt and brent:  
> So mak'st thou kings, & gaynest wrongfull gouernement.
>
> Long were to tell the troublous stormes, that tosse  
> The priuate state, and make the life vnsweet:  
> Who swelling sayles in Caspian sea doth crosse,  
> And in frayle wood on *Adrian* gulfe doth fleet,  
> Doth not, I weene, so many euils meet.  
> Then *Mammon* wexing wroth, And why then, said,  
> Are mortall men so fond and vndiscreet,  
> So euill thing to seeke vnto their ayd,  
> And hauing not complaine, and hauing it vpbraid?
>
> Indeede (quoth he) through fowle intemperaunce,  
> Frayle men are oft captiu'd to couetise:  
> But would they thinke, with how small allowaunce  
> Vntroubled Nature doth her selfe suffise,  
> Such superfluities they would despise,  
> Which with sad cares empeach our natiue ioyes:  
> At the well head the purest streames arise:  
> But mucky filth his braunching armes annoyes,  
> And with vncomely weedes the gentle waue accloyes.
>
> The antique world, in his first flowring youth,  
> Found no defect in his Creatours grace,  
> But with glad thankes, and vnreproued truth,  
> The gifts of soueraigne bountie did embrace:  
> Like Angels life was then mens happy cace;  
> But later ages pride, like corn-fed steed,  
> Abusd her plenty, and fat swolne encreace  
> To all licentious lust, and gan exceed  
> The measure of her meane, and naturall first need.
>
> Then gan a cursed hand the quiet wombe  
> Of his great G\[r\]andmother with steele to wound,  
> And the hid treasures in her sacred tombe,  
> With Sacriledge to dig. Therein he found  
> Fountaines of gold and siluer to abound,  
> Of which the matter of his huge desire  
> And pompous pride eftsoones he did compound;  
> Then auarice gan through his veines inspire  
> His greedy flames, and kindled life-deuouring fire.
>
> Sonne (said he then) let be thy bitter scorne,  
> And leaue the rudenesse of that antique age  
> To them, that liu'd therein in state forlorne;  
> Thou that doest liue in later times, must wage  
> Thy workes for wealth, and life for gold engage.  
> If then thee list my offred grace to vse,  
> Take what thou please of all this surplusage;  
> If thee list not, leaue haue thou to refuse:  
> But thing refused, do not afterward accuse.
>
> Me list not (said the Elfin knight) receaue  
> Thing offred, till I know it well be got,  
> Ne wote I, but thou didst these goods bereaue  
> From rightfull owner by vnrighteous lot,  
> Or that bloud guiltinesse or guile them blot.  
> Perdy (quoth he) yet neuer eye did vew,  
> Ne toung did tell, ne hand these handled not,  
> But safe I haue them kept in secret mew,  
> From heauens sight, and powre of all which thẽ pursew.
>
> What secret place (quoth he) can safely hold  
> So huge a masse, and hide from heauens eye?  
> Or where hast thou thy wonne, that so much gold  
> Thou canst preserue from wrong and robbery?  
> Come thou (quoth he) and see. So by and by  
> Through that thicke couert he him led, and found  
> A darkesome way, which no man could descry,  
> That deepe descended through the hollow ground,  
> And was with dread and horrour compassed around.
>
> At length they came into a larger space,  
> That stretcht it selfe into an ample plaine,  
> Through which a beaten broad high way did trace,  
> That streight did lead to *Plutoes* griesly raine:  
> By that wayes side, there sate infernall Payne,  
> And fast beside him sat tumultuous Strife:  
> The one in hand an yron whip did straine,  
> The other brandished a bloudy knife,  
> And both did gnash their teeth, & both did threaten life.
>
> On thother side in one consort there sate,  
> Cruell Reuenge, and rancorous Despight,  
> Disloyall Treason, and hart-burning Hate,  
> But gnawing Gealosie out of their sight  
> Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bight,  
> And trembling Feare still to and fro did fly,  
> And found no place, where safe he shroud him might,  
> Lamenting Sorrow did in darknesse lye,  
> And Shame his vgly face did hide from liuing eye.
>
> And ouer them sad Horrour with grim hew,  
> Did alwayes sore, beating his yron wings;  
> And after him Owles and Night-rauens flew,  
> The hatefull messengers of heauy things,  
> Of death and dolour telling sad tidings;  
> Whiles sad *Celeno*, sitting on a clift,  
> A song of bale and bitter sorrow sings,  
> That hart of flint a sunder could haue rift:  
> Which hauing ended, after him she flyeth swift.
>
> All these before the gates of *Pluto* lay,  
> By whom they passing, spake vnto them nought.  
> But th'Elfin knight with wonder all the way  
> Did feed his eyes, and fild his inner thought.  
> At last him to a litle dore he brought,  
> That to the gate of Hell, which gaped wide,  
> Was next adioyning, ne them parted ought:  
> Betwixt them both was but a litle stride,  
> That did the house of Richesse from hell-mouth diuide.
>
> Before the dore sat selfe-consuming Care,  
> Day and night keeping wary watch and ward,  
> For feare least Force or Fraud should vnaware  
> Breake in, and spoile the treasure there in gard:  
> Ne would he suffer Sleepe once thither-ward  
> Approch, albe his drowsie den were next;  
> For next to death is Sleepe to be compard:  
> Therefore his house is vnto his annext;  
> Here Sleep, there Richesse, & Hel-gate thẽ both betwext.
>
> So soone as *Mammon* there arriu'd, the dore  
> To him did open, and affoorded way;  
> Him followed eke Sir *Guyon* euermore,  
> Ne darkenesse him, ne daunger might dismay.  
> Soone as he entred was, the dore streight way  
> Did shut, and from behind it forth there lept  
> An vgly feend, more fowle then dismall day,  
> The which with monstrous stalke behind him stept,  
> And euer as he went, dew watch vpon him kept.
>
> Well hoped he, ere long that hardy guest,  
> If euer couetous hand, or lustfull eye,  
> Or lips he layd on thing, that likt him best,  
> Or euer sleepe his eye-strings did vntye,  
> Should be his pray. And therefore still on hye  
> He ouer him did hold his cruell clawes,  
> Threatning with greedy gripe to do him dye  
> And rend in peeces with his rauenous pawes,  
> If euer he transgrest the fatall *Stygian* lawes.
>
> That houses forme within was rude and strong,  
> Like an huge caue, hewne out of rocky clift,  
> From whose rough vaut the ragged breaches hong,  
> Embost with massy gold of glorious gift,  
> And with rich metall loaded euery rift,  
> That heauy ruine they did seeme to threat;  
> And ouer them *Arachne* high did lift  
> Her cunning web, and spred her subtile net,  
> Enwrapped in fowle smoke and clouds more blacke then Iet.
>
> Both roofe, and floore, and wals were all of gold,  
> But ouergrowne with dust and old decay,  
> And hid in darkenesse, that none could behold  
> The hew thereof: for vew of chearefull day  
> Did neuer in that house it selfe display,  
> But a faint shadow of vncertain light;  
> Such as a lamp, whose life does fade away:  
> Or as the Moone cloathed with clowdy night,  
> Does shew to him, that walkes in feare and sad affright.
>
> In all that rowme was nothing to be seene,  
> But huge great yron chests and coffers strong,  
> All bard with double bends, that none could weene  
> Them to efforce by violence or wrong;  
> On euery side they placed were along.  
> But all the ground with sculs was scattered,  
> And dead mens bones, which round about were flong,  
> Whose liues, it seemed, whilome there were shed,  
> And their vile carcases now left vnburied.
>
> They forward passe, ne *Guyon* yet spoke word,  
> Till that they came vnto an yron dore,  
> Which to them opened of his owne accord,  
> And shewd of richesse such exceeding store,  
> As eye of man did neuer see before;  
> Ne euer could within one place be found,  
> Though all the wealth, which is, or was of yore,  
> Could gathered be through all the world around,  
> And that aboue were added to that vnder ground.
>
> The charge thereof vnto a couetous Spright  
> Commaunded was, who thereby did attend,  
> And warily awaited day and night,  
> From other couetous feends it to defend,  
> Who it to rob and ransacke did intend.  
> Then *Mammon* turning to that warriour, said;  
> Loe here the worldes blis, loe here the end,  
> To which all men do ayme, rich to be made:  
> Such grace now to be happy, is before thee laid.
>
> Certes (said he) I n'ill thine offred grace,  
> Ne to be made so happy do intend:  
> Another blis before mine eyes I place,  
> Another happinesse, another end.  
> To them, that list, these base regardes I lend:  
> But I in armes, and in atchieuements braue,  
> Do rather choose my flitting houres to spend,  
> And to be Lord of those, that riches haue,  
> Then them to haue my selfe, and be their seruile sclaue.
>
> Thereat the feend his gnashing teeth did grate,  
> And grieu'd, so long to lacke his greedy pray;  
> For well he weened, that so glorious bayte  
> Would tempt his guest, to take thereof assay:  
> Had he so doen, he had him snatcht away,  
> More light then Culuer in the Faulcons fist.  
> Eternall God thee saue from such decay.  
> But whenas *Mammon* saw his purpose mist,  
> Him to entrap vnwares another way he wist.
>
> Thence forward he him led, and shortly brought  
> Vnto another rowme, whose dore forthright,  
> To him did open, as it had beene taught:  
> Therein an hundred raunges weren pight,  
> And hundred fornaces all burning bright;  
> By euery fornace many feends did bide,  
> Deformed creatures, horrible in sight,  
> And euery feend his busie paines applide,  
> To melt the golden metall, ready to be tride.
>
> One with great bellowes gathered filling aire,  
> And with forst wind the fewell did inflame;  
> Another did the dying bronds repaire  
> With yron toungs, and sprinckled oft the same  
> With liquid waues, fiers *Vulcans* rage to tame,  
> Who maistring them, renewd his former heat;  
> Some scumd the drosse, that from the metall came;  
> Some stird the molten owre with ladles great;  
> And euery one did swincke, and euery one did sweat.
>
> But when as earthly wight they present saw,  
> Glistring in armes and battailous aray,  
> From their whot worke they did themselues withdraw  
> To wonder at the sight: for till that day,  
> They neuer creature saw, that came that way.  
> Their staring eyes sparckling with feruent fire,  
> And vgly shapes did nigh the man dismay,  
> That were it not for shame, he would retire,  
> Till that him thus bespake their soueraigne Lord & sire.
>
> Behold, thou Faeries sonne, with mortall eye,  
> That liuing eye before did neuer see:  
> The thing, that thou didst craue so earnestly,  
> To weet, whence all the wealth late shewd by mee,  
> Proceeded, lo now is reueald to thee.  
> Here is the fountaine of the worldes good:  
> Now therefore, if thou wilt enriched bee,  
> Auise thee well, and chaunge thy wilfull mood,  
> Least thou perhaps hereafter wish, and be withstood.
>
> Suffise it then, thou Money God (quoth hee)  
> That all thine idle offers I refuse.  
> All that I need I haue; what needeth mee  
> To couet more, then I haue cause to vse?  
> With such vaine shewes thy worldlings vile abuse:  
> But giue me leaue to follow mine emprise.  
> *Mammon* was much displeasd, yet no'te he chuse,  
> But beare the rigour of his bold mesprise,  
> And thence him forward led, him further to entise.
>
> He brought him through a darksome narrow strait,  
> To a broad gate, all built of beaten gold:  
> The gate was open, but therein did wait  
> A sturdy villein, striding stiffe and bold,  
> As if that highest God defie he would;  
> In his right hand an yron club he held,  
> But he himselfe was all of golden mould,  
> Yet had both life and sence, and well could weld  
> That cursed weapon, when his cruell foes he queld.
>
> *Disdayne* he called was, and did disdaine  
> To be so cald, and who so did him call:  
> Sterne was his looke, and full of stomacke vaine,  
> His portaunce terrible, and stature tall,  
> Far passing th'hight of men terrestriall;  
> Like an huge Gyant of the *Titans* race,  
> That made him scorne all creatures great and small,  
> And with his pride all others powre deface:  
> More fit amongst blacke fiendes, then men to haue his place.
>
> Soone as those glitterand armes he did espye,  
> That with their brightnesse made that darknesse light,  
> His harmefull club he gan to hurtle hye,  
> And threaten batteill to the Faery knight;  
> Who likewise gan himselfe to batteill dight,  
> Till *Mammon* did his hasty hand withhold,  
> And counseld him abstaine from perilous fight:  
> For nothing might abash the villein bold,  
> Ne mortall steele emperce his miscreated mould.
>
> So hauing him with reason pacifide,  
> And the fiers Carle commaunding to forbeare,  
> He brought him in. The rowme was large and wide,  
> As it some Gyeld or solemne Temple weare:  
> Many great golden pillours did vpbeare  
> The massy roofe, and riches huge sustayne,  
> And euery pillour decked was full deare  
> With crownes and Diademes, & titles vaine,  
> Which mortall Princes wore, whiles they on earth did rayne.
>
> A route of people there assembled were,  
> Of euery sort and nation vnder skye,  
> Which with great vprore preaced to draw nere  
> To th'vpper part, where was aduaunced hye  
> A stately siege of soueraigne maiestye;  
> And thereon sat a woman gorgeous gay,  
> And richly clad in robes of royaltye,  
> That neuer earthly Prince in such aray  
> His glory did enhaunce, and pompous pride display.
>
> Her face right wondrous faire did seeme to bee,  
> That her broad beauties beam great brightnes threw  
> Through the dim shade, that all men might it see:  
> Yet was not that same her owne natiue hew,  
> But wrought by art and counterfetted shew,  
> Thereby more louers vnto her to call;  
> Nath'lesse most heauenly faire in deed and vew  
> She by creation was, till she did fall;  
> Thenceforth she sought for helps, to cloke her crime withall.
>
> There, as in glistring glory she did sit,  
> She held a great gold chaine ylincked well,  
> Whose vpper end to highest heauen was knit,  
> And lower part did reach to lowest Hell;  
> And all that preace did round about her swell,  
> To catchen hold of that long chaine, thereby  
> To clime aloft, and others to excell:  
> That was *Ambition*, rash desire to sty,  
> And euery lincke thereof a step of dignity.
>
> Some thought to raise themselues to high degree,  
> By riches and vnrighteous reward,  
> Some by close shouldring, some by flatteree;  
> Others through friends, others for base regard;  
> And all by wrong wayes for themselues prepard.  
> Those that were vp themselues, kept others low,  
> Those that were low themselues, held others hard,  
> Ne suffred them to rise or greater grow,  
> But euery one did striue his fellow downe to throw.
>
> Which whenas *Guyon* saw, he gan inquire,  
> What meant that preace about that Ladies throne,  
> And what she was that did so high aspire.  
> Him *Mammon* answered; That goodly one,  
> Whom all that folke with such contention,  
> Do flocke about, my deare my daughter is;  
> Honour and dignitie from her alone,  
> Deriued are, and all this worldes blis  
> For which ye men do striue: few get, but many mis.
>
> And faire *Philotime* she rightly hight,  
> The fairest wight that wonneth vnder skye,  
> But that this darksome neather world her light  
> Doth dim with horrour and deformitie,  
> Worthy of heauen and hye felicitie,  
> From whence the gods haue her for enuy thrust:  
> But sith thou hast found fauour in mine eye,  
> Thy spouse I will her make, if that thou lust,  
> That she may thee aduance for workes and merites iust.
>
> Gramercy *Mammon* (said the gentle knight)  
> For so great grace and offred high estate;  
> But I, that am fraile flesh and earthly wight,  
> Vnworthy match for such immortall mate  
> My selfe well wote, and mine vnequall fate;  
> And were I not, yet is my trouth yplight,  
> And loue auowd to other Lady late,  
> That to remoue the same I haue no might:  
> To chaunge loue causelesse is reproch to warlike knight.
>
> *Mammon* emmoued was with inward wrath;  
> Yet forcing it to faine, him forth thence led  
> Through griesly shadowes by a beaten path,  
> Into a gardin goodly garnished  
> With hearbs and fruits, whose kinds mote not be red:  
> Not such, as earth out of her fruitfull woomb  
> Throwes forth to men, sweet and well sauoured,  
> But direfull deadly blacke both leafe and bloom,  
> Fit to adorne the dead, and decke the drery toombe.
>
> There mournfull *Cypresse* grew in greatest store,  
> And trees of bitter *Gall*, and *Heben* sad,  
> Dead sleeping *Poppy*, and blacke *Hellebore*,  
> Cold *Coloquintida*, and *Tetra* mad,  
> Mortall *Samnitis*, and *Cicuta* bad,  
> With which th'vniust *Atheniens* made to dy  
> Wise *Socrates*, who thereof quaffing glad  
> Pourd out his life, and last Philosophy  
> To the faire *Critias* his dearest Belamy.
>
> The *Gardin* of *Proserpina* this hight;  
> And in the midst thereof a siluer seat,  
> With a thicke Arber goodly ouer dight,  
> In which she often vsd from open heat  
> Her selfe to shroud, and pleasures to entreat.  
> Next thereunto did grow a goodly tree,  
> With braunches broad dispred and body great,  
> Clothed with leaues, that none the wood mote see  
> And loaden all with fruit as thicke as it might bee.
>
> Their fruit were golden apples glistring bright,  
> That goodly was their glory to behold,  
> On earth like neuer grew, ne liuing wight  
> Like euer saw, but they from hence were sold;  
> For those, which *Hercules* with conquest bold  
> Got from great *Atlas* daughters, hence began,  
> And planted there, did bring forth fruit of gold:  
> And those with which th'*Eubæan* young man wan  
> Swift *Atalanta*, when through craft he her out ran.
>
> Here also sprong that goodly golden fruit,  
> With which *Acontius* got his louer trew,  
> Whom he had long time sought with fruitlesse suit:  
> Here eke that famous golden Apple grew,  
> The which emongst the gods false *Ate* threw;  
> For which th'*Idæan* Ladies disagreed,  
> Till partiall *Paris* dempt it *Venus* dew,  
> And had of her, faire *Helen* for his meed,  
> That many noble *Greekes* and *Troians* made to bleed.
>
> The warlike Elfe much wondred at this tree,  
> So faire and great, that shadowed all the ground,  
> And his broad braunches, laden with rich fee,  
> Did stretch themselues without the vtmost bound  
> Of this great gardin, compast with a mound,  
> Which ouer-hanging, they themselues did steepe,  
> In a blacke flood which flow'd about it round;  
> That is the riuer of *Cocytus* deepe,  
> In which full many soules do endlesse waile and weepe.
>
> Which to behold, he clomb vp to the banke,  
> And looking downe, saw many damned wights,  
> In those sad waues, which direfull deadly stanke,  
> Plonged continually of cruell Sprights,  
> That with their pitteous cryes, and yelling shrights,  
> They made the further shore resounden wide:  
> Emongst the rest of those same ruefull sights,  
> One cursed creature, he by chaunce espide,  
> That drenched lay full deepe, vnder the Garden side.
>
> Deepe was he drenched to the vpmost chin,  
> Yet gaped still, as coueting to drinke  
> Of the cold liquor, which he waded in,  
> And stretching forth his hand, did often thinke  
> To reach the fruit, which grew vpon the brincke:  
> But both the fruit from hand, and floud from mouth  
> Did flie abacke, and made him vainely swinke:  
> The whiles he steru'd with hunger and with drouth  
> He daily dyde, yet neuer throughly dyen couth.
>
> The knight him seeing labour so in vaine,  
> Askt who he was, and what he ment thereby:  
> Who groning deepe, thus answerd him againe;  
> Most cursed of all creatures vnder skye,  
> Lo *Tantalus*, I here tormented lye:  
> Of whom high *Ioue* wont whylome feasted bee,  
> Lo here I now for want of food doe dye:  
> But if that thou be such, as I thee see,  
> Of grace I pray thee, giue to eat and drinke to mee.
>
> Nay, nay, thou greedie *Tantalus* (quoth he)  
> Abide the fortune of thy present fate,  
> And vnto all that liue in high degree,  
> Ensample be of mind intemperate,  
> To teach them how to vse their present state.  
> Then gan the cursed wretch aloud to cry,  
> Accusing highest *Ioue* and gods ingrate,  
> And eke blaspheming heauen bitterly,  
> As authour of vniustice, there to let him dye.
>
> He lookt a little further, and espyde  
> Another wretch, whose carkasse deepe was drent  
> Within the riuer, which the same did hyde:  
> But both his hands most filthy feculent,  
> Aboue the water were on high extent,  
> And faynd to wash themselues incessantly;  
> Yet nothing cleaner were for such intent,  
> But rather fowler seemed to the eye;  
> So lost his labour vaine and idle industry.
>
> The knight him calling, asked who he was,  
> Who lifting vp his head, him answerd thus:  
> I *Pilate* am the falsest Iudge, alas,  
> And most vniust, that by vnrighteous  
> And wicked doome, to Iewes despiteous  
> Deliuered vp the Lord of life to die,  
> And did acquite a murdrer felonous;  
> The whiles my hands I washt in puritie,  
> The whiles my soule was soyld with foule iniquitie.
>
> Infinite moe, tormented in like paine  
> He there beheld, too long here to be told:  
> Ne *Mammon* would there let him long remaine,  
> For terrour of the tortures manifold,  
> In which the damned soules he did behold,  
> But roughly him bespake. Thou fearefull foole,  
> Why takest not of that same fruit of gold,  
> Ne sittest downe on that same siluer stoole,  
> To rest thy wearie person, in the shadow coole.
>
> All which he did, to doe him deadly fall  
> In frayle intemperance through sinfull bayt;  
> To which if he inclined had at all,  
> That dreadfull feend, which did behind him wayt,  
> Would him haue rent in thousand peeces strayt:  
> But he was warie wise in all his way,  
> And well perceiued his deceiptfull sleight,  
> Ne suffred lust his safetie to betray;  
> So goodly did beguile the Guyler of the pray.
>
> And now he has so long remained there,  
> That vitall powres gan wexe both weake and wan,  
> For want of food, and sleepe, which two vpbeare,  
> Like mightie pillours, this fraile life of man,  
> That none without the same enduren can.  
> For now three dayes of men were full outwrought,  
> Since he this hardie enterprize began:  
> For thy great *Mammon* fairely he besought,  
> Into the world to guide him backe, as he him brought.
>
> The God, though loth, yet was constraind t'obay,  
> For lenger time, then that, no liuing wight  
> Below the earth, might suffred be to stay:  
> So backe againe, him brought to liuing light.  
> But all so soone as his enfeebled spright  
> Gan sucke this vitall aire into his brest,  
> As ouercome with too exceeding might,  
> The life did flit away out of her nest,  
> And all his senses were with deadly fit opprest.
