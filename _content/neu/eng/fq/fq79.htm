<blockquote>
<i>Proud</i> Change <i>(not pleasd, in mortall things,<br>
beneath the Moone, to raigne)<br>
Pretends, as well of Gods, as Men,<br>
to be the Soueraine.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
W
Hat man that sees the euer-whirling wheele<br>
Of <i>Change</i>, the which all mortall things doth sway,<br>
But that therby doth find, &amp; plainly feele,<br>
How <i>MVTABILITY</i> in them doth play<br>
Her cruell sports, to many mens decay?<br>
Which that to all may better yet appeare,<br>
I will rehearse that whylome I heard say,<br>
How she at first her selfe began to reare,<br>
Gainst all the Gods, and th'empire sought from them to beare.<p>

But first, here falleth fittest to vnfold<br>
Her antique race and linage ancient,<br>
As I haue found it registred of old,<br>
In <i>Faery</i> Land mongst records permanent:<br>
She was, to weet, a daughter by descent<br>
Of those old <i>Titans</i>, that did whylome striue<br>
VVith <i>Saturnes</i> sonne for heauens regiment.<br>
Whom, though high <i>Ioue</i> of kingdome did depriue,<br>
Yet many of their stemme long after did surviue.<p>

And many of them, afterwards obtain'd<br>
Great power of <i>Ioue</i>, and high authority;<br>
As <i>Hecat&eacute;</i>, in whose almighty hand,<br>
He plac't all rule and principality,<br>
To be by her disposed diuersly,<br>
To Gods, and men, as she them list diuide:<br>
And drad <i>Bellona</i>, that doth sound on hie<br>
Warres and allarums vnto Nations wide,<br>
That makes both heauen &amp; earth to tremble at her pride.<p>

So likewise did this <i>Titanesse</i> aspire,<br>
Rule and dominion to her selfe to gaine;<br>
That as a Goddesse, men might her admire,<br>
And heauenly honours yield, as to them twaine.<br>
At first, on earth she sought it to obtaine;<br>
Where she such proofe and sad examples shewed<br>
Of her great power, to many ones great paine,<br>
That not men onely (whom she soone subdewed)<br>
But eke all other creatures, her bad dooings rewed.<p>

For, she the face of earthly things so changed,<br>
That all which Nature had establisht first<br>
In good estate, and in meet order ranged,<br>
She did pervert, and all their statutes burst:<br>
And all the worlds faire frame (which none yet durst<br>
Of Gods or men to alter or misguide)<br>
She alter'd quite, and made them all accurst<br>
That God had blest; and did at first prouide<br>
In that still happy state for euer to abide.<p>

Ne shee the lawes of Nature onely brake,<br>
But eke of Iustice, and of Policie;<br>
And wrong of right, and bad of good did make,<br>
And death for life exchanged foolishlie:<br>
Since which, all liuing wights haue learn'd to die,<br>
And all this world is woxen daily worse.<br>
Of pittious worke of <i>MVTABILITIE</i>!<br>
By which, we all are subiect to that curse,<br>
And death in stead of life haue sucked from our Nurse.<p>

And now, when all the earth she thus had brought<br>
To her behest, and thralled to her might,<br>
She gan to cast in her ambitious thought,<br>
T'attempt the empire of the heauens hight,<br>
And <i>Ioue</i> himselfe to shoulder from his right.<br>
And first, she past the region of the ayre,<br>
And of the fire, whose substance thin and slight,<br>
Made no resistance, ne could her contraire,<br>
But ready passage to her pleasure did prepaire.<p>

Thence, to the Circle of the Moone she clambe,<br>
Where <i>Cynthia</i> raignes in euerlasting glory,<br>
To whose bright shining palace straight she came,<br>
All fairely deckt with heauens goodly story:<br>
Whose siluer gates (by which there sate an hory<br>
Old aged Sire, with hower-glasse in hand,<br>
Hight <i>Tyme</i>) she entred, were he liefe or sory:<br>
Ne staide till she the highest stage had scand,<br>
VVhere <i>Cynthia</i> did sit, that neuer still did stand.<p>

Her sitting on an Iuory throne shee found,<br>
Drawne of two steeds, th'one black, the other white,<br>
Environd with tenne thousand starres around,<br>
That duly her attended day and night;<br>
And by her side, there ran her Page, that hight<br>
<i>Vesper</i>, whom we the Euening-starre intend:<br>
That with his Torche, still twinkling like twylight,<br>
Her lightened all the way where she should wend,<br>
And ioy to weary wandring trauailers did lend:<p>

That when the hardy <i>Titanesse</i> beheld<br>
The goodly building of her Palace bright,<br>
Made of the heauens substance, and vp-held<br>
With thousand Crystall pillors of huge hight,<br>
Shee gan to burne in her ambitious spright,<br>
And t'envie her that in such glorie raigned.<br>
Eftsoones she cast by force and tortious might,<br>
Her to displace; and to her selfe to haue gained<br>
The kingdome of the Night, and waters by her wained.<p>

Boldly she bid the Goddesse downe descend,<br>
And let her selfe into that Ivory throne;<br>
For, shee her selfe more worthy thereof wend,<br>
And better able it to guide alone:<br>
Whether to men, whose fall she did bemone,<br>
Or vnto Gods, whose state she did maligne,<br>
Or to th'infernall Powers, her need giue lone<br>
Of her faire light, and bounty most benigne,<br>
Her selfe of all that rule shee deemed most condigne.<p>

But shee that had to her that soueraigne seat<br>
By highest <i>Ioue</i> assign'd, therein to beare<br>
Nights burning lamp, regarded not her threat,<br>
Ne yielded ought for fauour or for feare;<br>
But with sterne countenaunce and disdainfull cheare,<br>
Bending her horned browes, did put her back:<br>
And boldly blaming her for comming there,<br>
Bade her attonce from heauens coast to pack,<br>
Or at her perill bide the wrathfull Thunders wrack.<p>

Yet nathemore the <i>Giantesse</i> forbare:<br>
But boldly preacing-on, raught forth her hand<br>
To pluck her downe perforce from off her chaire;<br>
And there-with lifting vp her golden wand,<br>
Threatned to strike her if she did with-stand.<br>
Whereat the starres, which round about her blazed,<br>
And eke the Moones bright wagon, still did stand,<br>
All beeing with so bold attempt amazed,<br>
And on her vncouth habit and sterne looke still gazed.<p>

Meane-while, the lower World, which nothing knew<br>
Of all that chaunced here, was darkned quite;<br>
And eke the heauens, and all the heauenly crew<br>
Of happy wights, now vnpurvaide of light,<br>
Were much afraid, and wondred at that sight;<br>
Fearing least <i>Chaos</i> broken had his chaine,<br>
And brought againe on them eternall night:<br>
But chiefely <i>Mercury</i>, that next doth raigne,<br>
Ran forth in haste, vnto the king of Gods to plaine.<p>

All ran together with a great out-cry,<br>
To <i>Ioues</i> faire Palace, fixt in heauens hight;<br>
And beating at his gates full earnestly,<br>
Gan call to him aloud with all their might,<br>
To know what meant that suddaine lack of light.<br>
The father of the Gods when this he heard,<br>
Was troubled much at their so strange affright,<br>
Doubting least <i>Typhon</i> were againe vprear'd,<br>
Or other his old foes, that once him sorely fear'd.<p>

Eftsoones the sonne of <i>Maia</i> forth he sent<br>
Downe to the Circle of the Moone, to knowe<br>
The cause of this so strange astonishment,<br>
And why shee did her wonted course forslowe;<br>
And if that any were on earth belowe<br>
That did with charmes or Magick her molest,<br>
Him to attache, and downe to hell to throwe:<br>
But, if from heauen it were, then to arrest<br>
The Author, and him bring before his presence prest.<p>

The wingd-foot God, so fast his plumes did beat,<br>
That soone he came where-as the <i>Titanesse</i><br>
Was striuing with faire <i>Cynthia</i> for her seat:<br>
At whose strange sight, and haughty hardinesse,<br>
He wondred much, and feared her no lesse.<br>
Yet laying feare aside to doe his charge,<br>
At last, he bade her (with bold stedfastnesse)<br>
Ceasse to molest the Moone to walke at large,<br>
Or come before high <i>Ioue</i>, her dooings to discharge.<p>

And there-with-all, he on her shoulder laid<br>
His snaky-wreathed Mace, whose awfull power<br>
Doth make both Gods and hellish fiends affraid:<br>
Where-at the <i>Titanesse</i> did sternely lower,<br>
And stoutly answer'd, that in euill hower<br>
He from his <i>Ioue</i> such message to her brought,<br>
To bid her leaue faire <i>Cynthias</i> siluer bower;<br>
Sith shee his <i>Ioue</i> and him esteemed nought,<br>
No more then <i>Cynthia's</i> selfe; but all their kingdoms sought.<p>

The Heauens Herald staid not to reply,<br>
But past away, his doings to relate<br>
Vnto his Lord; who now in th'highest sky,<br>
VVas placed in his principall Estate,<br>
VVith all the Gods about him congregate:<br>
To whom when <i>Hermes</i> had his message told,<br>
It did them all exceedingly amate,<br>
Saue <i>Ioue</i>; who, changing nought his count'nance bold,<br>
Did vnto them at length these speeches wise vnfold;<p>

Harken to mee awhile yee heauenly Powers;<br>
Ye may remember since th'Earths cursed seed<br>
Sought to assaile the heauens eternall towers,<br>
And to vs all exceeding feare did breed:<br>
But how we then defeated all their deed,<br>
Yee all doe knowe, and them destroied quite;<br>
Yet not so quite, but that there did succeed<br>
An off-spring of their bloud, which did alite<br>
Vpon the fruitfull earth, which doth vs yet despite.<p>

Of that bad seed is this bold woman bred,<br>
That now with bold presumption doth aspire<br>
To thrust faire <i>Phoebe</i> from her siluer bed,<br>
And eke our selues from heauens high Empire,<br>
If that her might were match to her desire:<br>
Wherefore, it now behoues vs to advise<br>
What way is best to driue her to retire;<br>
Whether by open force, or counsell wise,<br>
Areed ye sonnes of God, as best ye can deuise.<p>

So hauing said, he ceast; and with his brow<br>
(His black eye-brow, whose doomefull dreaded beck<br>
Is wont to wield the world vnto his vow,<br>
And euen the highest Powers of heauen to check)<br>
Made signe to them in their degrees to speake:<br>
Who straight gan cast their counsell graue and wise.<br>
Meane-while, th'Earths daughter, thogh she nought did reck<br>
Of <i>Hermes</i> message; yet gan now advise,<br>
What course were best to take in this hot bold emprize.<p>

Eftsoones she thus resolv'd; that whil'st the Gods<br>
(After returne of <i>Hermes</i> Embassie)<br>
Were troubled, and amongst themselues at ods,<br>
Before they could new counsels re-allie,<br>
To set vpon them in that extasie;<br>
And take what fortune time and place would lend:<br>
So, forth she rose, and through the purest sky<br>
To <i>Ioues</i> high Palace straight cast to ascend,<br>
To prosecute her plot: Good on-set boads good end.<p>

Shee there arriuing, boldly in did pass;<br>
Where all the Gods she found in counsell close,<br>
All quite vnarm'd, as then their manner was.<br>
At sight of her they suddaine all arose,<br>
In great amaze, ne wist what way to chose.<br>
But <i>Ioue</i>, all fearelesse, forc't them to aby;<br>
And in his soueraine throne, gan straight dispose<br>
Himselfe more full of grace and Maiestie,<br>
That mote encheare his friends, &amp; foes mote terrifie.<p>

That, when the haughty <i>Titanesse</i> beheld,<br>
All were she fraught with pride and impudence,<br>
Yet with the sight thereof was almost queld;<br>
And inly quaking, seem'd as reft of sense,<br>
And voyd of speech in that drad audience;<br>
Vntill that <i>Ioue</i> himselfe, her selfe bespake:<br>
Speake thou fraile woman, speake with confidence,<br>
Whence art thou, and what doost thou here now make?<br>
What idle errand hast thou, earths mansion to forsake?<p>

Shee, halfe confused with his great commaund,<br>
Yet gathering spirit of her natures pride,<br>
Him boldly answer'd thus to his demaund:<br>
I am a daughter, by the mothers side,<br>
Of her that is Grand-mother magnifide<br>
Of all the Gods, great <i>Earth</i>, great <i>Chaos</i> child:<br>
But by the fathers (be it not envide)<br>
I greater am in bloud (whereon I build)<br>
Then all the Gods, though wrongfully from heauen exil'd.<p>

For, <i>Titan</i> (as ye all acknowledge must)<br>
Was <i>Saturnes</i> elder brother by birth-right;<br>
Both, sonnes of <i>Vranus:</i> but by vniust<br>
And guilefull meanes, through <i>Corybantes</i> slight,<br>
The younger thrust the elder from his right:<br>
Since which, thou <i>Ioue</i>, iniuriously hast held<br>
The Heauens rule from <i>Titans</i> sonnes by might;<br>
And them to hellish dungeons downe hast feld:<br>
Witnesse ye Heauens the truth of all that I haue teld.<p>

Whil'st she thus spake, the Gods that gaue good eare<br>
To her bold words, and marked well her grace,<br>
Beeing of stature tall as any there<br>
Of all the Gods, and beautifull of face,<br>
As any of the Goddesses in place,<br>
Stood all astonied, like a sort of Steeres;<br>
Mongst whom, some beast of strange &amp; forraine race,<br>
Vnwares is chaunc't, far straying from his peeres:<br>
So did their ghastly gaze bewray their hidden feares.<p>

Till hauing pauz'd awhile, <i>Ioue</i> thus bespake;<br>
VVill neuer mortall thoughts ceasse to aspire,<br>
In this bold sort, to Heauen claime to make,<br>
And touch celestiall seates with earthly mire?<br>
I would haue thought, that bold <i>Procrustes</i> hire,<br>
Or <i>Typhons</i> fall, or proud <i>Ixions</i> paine,<br>
Or great <i>Prometheus</i>, tasting of our ire,<br>
Would haue suffiz'd, the rest for to restraine;<br>
And warn'd all men by their example to refraine:<p>

But now, this off-scum of that cursed fry,<br>
Dare to renew the like bold enterprize,<br>
And chalenge th'heritage of this our skie;<br>
Whom what should hinder, but that we likewise<br>
Should handle as the rest of her allies,<br>
And thunder-driue to hell? With that, he shooke<br>
His Nectar-deawed locks, with which the skyes<br>
And all the world beneath for terror quooke,<br>
And eft his burning levin-brond in hand he tooke.<p>

But, when he looked on her louely face,<br>
In which, faire beames of beauty did appeare,<br>
That could the greatest wrath soone turne to grace<br>
(Such sway doth beauty euen in Heauen beare)<br>
He staide his hand: and hauing chang'd his cheare,<br>
He thus againe in milder wise began;<br>
But ah! if Gods should striue with flesh yfere,<br>
Then shortly should the progeny of Man<br>
Be rooted out, if <i>Ioue</i> should doe still what he can:<p>

But thee faire <i>Titans</i> child, I rather weene,<br>
Through some vaine errour or inducement light,<br>
To see that mortall eyes haue neuer seene;<br>
Or through ensample of thy sisters might,<br>
<i>Bellona</i>; whose great glory thou doost spight,<br>
Since thou hast seene her dreadfull power belowe,<br>
Mongst wretched men (dismaide with her affright)<br>
To bandie Crownes, and Kingdomes to bestowe:<br>
And sure thy worth, no lesse then hers doth seem to showe.<p>

But wote thou this, thou hardy <i>Titanesse</i>,<br>
That not the worth of any liuing wight<br>
May challenge ought in Heauens interesse;<br>
Much lesse the Title of old <i>Titans</i> Right:<br>
For, we by Conquest of our soueraine might,<br>
And by eternall doome of Fates decree,<br>
Haue wonne the Empire of the Heauens bright;<br>
Which to our selues we hold, and to whom wee<br>
Shall worthy deeme partakers of our blisse to bee.<p>

Then ceasse thy idle claime thou foolish gerle,<br>
And seeke by grace and goodnesse to obtaine<br>
That place from which by folly <i>Titan</i> fell;<br>
There-to thou maist perhaps, if so thou faine<br>
Haue <i>Ioue</i> thy gratious Lord and Soueraigne.<br>
So, hauing said, she thus to him replide;<br>
Ceasse <i>Saturnes</i> sonne, to seeke by proffers vaine<br>
Of idle hopes t'allure mee to thy side,<br>
For to betray my Right, before I haue it tride.<p>

But thee, &ocirc; <i>Ioue</i>, no equall Iudge I deeme<br>
Of my desert, or of my dewfull Right;<br>
That in thine owne behalfe maist partiall seeme:<br>
But to the highest him, that is behight<br>
Father of Gods and men by equall might;<br>
To weet, the God of Nature, I appeale.<br>
There-at <i>Ioue</i> wexed wroth, and in his spright<br>
Did inly grudge, yet did it well conceale;<br>
And bade <i>Dan Phoebus</i> Scribe her Appellation seale.<p>

Eftsoones the time and place appointed were,<br>
Where all, both heauenly Powers, &amp; earthly wights,<br>
Before great Natures presence should appeare,<br>
For triall of their Titles and best Rights:<br>
That was, to weet, vpon the highest hights<br>
Of <i>Arlo-hill</i> (Who knowes not <i>Arlo-hill?</i>)<br>
That is the highest head (in all mens sights)<br>
Of my old father <i>Mole</i>, whom Shepheards quill<br>
Renowmed hath with hymnes fit for a rurall skill.<p>

And, were it not ill fitting for this file,<br>
To sing of hilles &amp; woods, mongst warres &amp; Knights,<br>
I would abate the sternenesse of my stile,<br>
Mongst these sterne stounds to mingle soft delights;<br>
And tell how <i>Arlo</i> through <i>Dianaes</i> spights<br>
(Beeing of old the best and fairest Hill<br>
That was in all this holy-Islands hights)<br>
Was made the most vnpleasant, and most ill.<br>
Meane while, &ocirc; <i>Clio</i>, lend <i>Calliope</i> thy quill.<p>

Whylome, when <i>IRELAND</i> florished in fame<br>
Of wealths and goodnesse, far aboue the rest<br>
Of all that beare the <i>British</i> Islands name,<br>
The Gods then vs'd (for pleasure and for rest)<br>
Oft to resort there-to, when seem'd them best:<br>
But none of all there-in more pleasure found,<br>
Then <i>Cynthia</i>; that is soueraine Queene profest<br>
Of woods and forrests, which therein abound,<br>
Sprinkled with wholsom waters, more th&#7869; most on ground.<p>

But mongst them all, as fittest for her game,<br>
Either for chace of beasts with hound or boawe,<br>
Or for to shroude in shade from <i>Phoebus</i> flame,<br>
Or bathe in fountaines that doe freshly flowe,<br>
Or from high hilles, or from the dales belowe,<br>
She chose this <i>Arlo</i>; where shee did resort<br>
With all her Nymphes enranged on a rowe,<br>
With whom the woody Gods did oft consort:<br>
For, with the Nymphes, the Satyres loue to play &amp; sport.<p>

Amongst the which, there was a Nymph that hight<br>
<i>Molanna</i>; daughter of old father <i>Mole</i>,<br>
And sister vnto <i>Mulla</i>, faire and bright:<br>
Vnto whose bed false <i>Bregog</i> whylome stole,<br>
That Shepheard <i>Colin</i> dearely did condole,<br>
And made her lucklesse loues well knowne to be.<br>
But this <i>Molanna</i>, were she not so shole,<br>
Were no lesse faire and beautifull then shee:<br>
Yet as she is, a fairer flood may no man see.<p>

For, first, she springs out of two marble Rocks,<br>
On which, a groue of Oakes high mounted growes,<br>
That as a girlond seemes to deck the locks<br>
Of som faire Bride, brought forth with pompous showes<br>
Out of her bowre, that many flowers strowes:<br>
So, through the flowry Dales she tumbling downe,<br>
Through many woods, and shady coverts flowes<br>
(That on each side her siluer channell crowne)<br>
Till to the Plaine she come, whose Valleyes shee doth drowne.<p>

In her sweet streames, <i>Diana</i> vsed oft<br>
(After her sweatie chace and toilesome play)<br>
To bathe her selfe; and after, on the soft<br>
And downy grasse, her dainty limbes to lay<br>
In couert shade, where none behold her may:<br>
For, much she hated sight of liuing eye.<br>
Foolish God <i>Faunus</i>, though full many a day<br>
He saw her clad, yet longed foolishly<br>
To see her naked mongst her Nymphes in priuity.<p>

No way he found to compasse his desire,<br>
But to corrupt <i>Molanna</i>, this her maid,<br>
Her to discouer for some secret hire:<br>
So, her with flattering words he first assaid;<br>
And after, pleasing gifts for her purvaid,<br>
Queene-apples, and red Cherries from the tree,<br>
VVith which he her allured and betraid,<br>
To tell what time he might her Lady see<br>
When she her selfe did bathe, that he might secret bee.<p>

There-to hee promist, if shee would him pleasure<br>
With this small boone, to quit her with a better;<br>
To weet, that where-as shee had out of measure<br>
Long lov'd the <i>Fanchin</i>, who by nought did set her,<br>
That he would vndertake, for this to get her<br>
To be his Loue, and of him liked well:<br>
Besides all which, he vow'd to be her debter<br>
For many moe good turnes then he would tell;<br>
The least of which, this little pleasure should excell.<p>

The simple maid did yield to him anone;<br>
And eft him placed where he close might view<br>
That neuer any saw, saue onely one;<br>
VVho, for his hire to so foole-hardy dew,<br>
Was of his hounds devour'd in Hunters hew.<br>
Tho, as her manner was on sunny day,<br>
<i>Diana</i>, with her Nymphes about her, drew<br>
To this sweet spring; where, doffing her array,<br>
She bath'd her louely limbes, for <i>Ioue</i> a likely pray.<p>

There <i>Faunus</i> saw that pleased much his eye,<br>
And made his hart to tickle in his brest,<br>
That for great ioy of some-what he did spy,<br>
He could him not containe in silent rest;<br>
But breaking forth in laughter, loud profest<br>
His foolish thought.  O foolish <i>Faune</i> indeed,<br>
That couldst not hold thy selfe so hidden blest,<br>
But wouldest needs thine owne conceit areed.<br>
Babblers vnworthy been of so diuine a meed.<p>

The Goddesse, all abashed with that noise,<br>
In haste forth started from the guilty brooke;<br>
And running straight where-as she heard his voice,<br>
Enclos'd the bush about, and there him tooke,<br>
Like darred Larke; not daring vp to looke<br>
On her whose sight before so much he sought.<br>
Thence, forth they drew him by the hornes, &amp; shooke<br>
Nigh all to peeces, that they left him nought;<br>
And then into the open light they forth him brought.<p>

Like as an huswife, that with busie care<br>
Thinks of her Dairie to make wondrous gaine,<br>
Finding where-as some wicked beast vnware<br>
That breakes into her Dayr'house, there doth draine<br>
Her creaming pannes, and frustrate all her paine;<br>
Hath in some snare or gin set close behind,<br>
Entrapped him, and caught into her traine,<br>
Then thinkes what punishment were best assign'd,<br>
And thousand deathes deuiseth in her vengefull mind:<p>

So did <i>Diana</i> and her maydens all<br>
Vse silly <i>Faunus</i>, now within their baile:<br>
They mocke and scorne him, and him foule miscall;<br>
Some by the nose him pluckt, some by the taile,<br>
And by his goatish beard some did him haile:<br>
Yet he (poore soule) with patience all did beare;<br>
For, nought against their wils might countervaile:<br>
Ne ought he said what euer he did heare;<br>
But hanging downe his head, did like a Mome appeare.<p>

At length, when they had flouted him their fill,<br>
They gan to cast what penaunce him to giue.<br>
Some would haue gelt him, but that same would spill<br>
The Wood-gods breed, which must for euer liue:<br>
Others would through the riuer him haue driue,<br>
And ducked deepe: but that seem'd penaunce light;<br>
But most agreed and did this sentence giue,<br>
Him in Deares skin to clad; &amp; in that plight,<br>
To hunt him with their hounds, him selfe saue how hee might.<p>

But <i>Cynthia's</i> selfe, more angry then the rest,<br>
Thought not enough, to punish him in sport,<br>
And of her shame to make a gamesome iest;<br>
But gan examine him in straighter sort,<br>
Which of her Nymphes, or other close consort,<br>
Him thither brought, and her to him betraid?<br>
He, much affeard, to her confessed short,<br>
That 'twas <i>Molanna</i> which her so bewraid.<br>
Then all attonce their hands vpon <i>Molanna</i> laid.<p>

But him (according as they had decreed)<br>
With a Deeres-skin they couered, and then chast<br>
With all their hounds that after him did speed;<br>
But he more speedy, from them fled more fast<br>
Then any Deere: so sore him dread aghast.<br>
They after follow'd all with shrill out-cry,<br>
Shouting as they the heauens would haue brast:<br>
That all the woods and dales where he did flie,<br>
Did ring againe, and loud reeccho to the skie.<p>

So they him follow'd till they weary were;<br>
When, back returning to <i>Molann</i>' againe,<br>
They, by commaund'ment of <i>Diana</i>, there<br>
Her whelm'd with stones.  Yet <i>Faunus</i> (for her paine)<br>
Of her beloued <i>Fanchin</i> did obtaine,<br>
That her he would receiue vnto his bed.<br>
So now her waues passe through a pleasant Plaine,<br>
Till with the <i>Fanchin</i> she her selfe doe wed,<br>
And (both combin'd) themselues in one faire riuer spred.<p>

Nath'lesse, <i>Diana</i>, full of indignation,<br>
Thence-forth abandond her delicious brooke;<br>
In whose sweet streame, before that bad occasion,<br>
So much delight to bathe her limbes she tooke:<br>
Ne onely her, but also quite forsooke<br>
All those faire forrests about <i>Arlo</i> hid,<br>
And all that Mountaine, which doth over-looke<br>
The richest champian that may else be rid,<br>
And the faire <i>Shure</i>, in which are thousand Salmons bred.<p>

Them all, and all that she so deare did way,<br>
Thence-forth she left; and parting from the place,<br>
There-on an heauy haplesse curse did lay,<br>
To weet, that Wolues, where she was wont to space,<br>
Should harbour'd be, and all those Woods deface,<br>
And Thieues should rob and spoile that Coast around.<br>
Since which, those Woods, and all that goodly Chase,<br>
Doth to this day with Wolues and Thieues abound:<br>
Which too-too true that lands in-dwellers since haue fo&#361;d.<p>
