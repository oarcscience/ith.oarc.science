<blockquote>
<i>The theeues fall out for Pastorell,<br>
VVhilest Melibee is slaine:<br>
Her Calidore from them redeemes,<br>
And bringeth backe againe.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
T
He ioyes of loue, if they should euer last,<br>
Without affliction or disquietnesse,<br>
That worldly chaunces doe amongst them cast,<br>
Would be on earth too great a blessednesse,<br>
Liker to heauen, then mortall wretchednesse.<br>
Therefore the winged God, to let men weet,<br>
That here on earth is no sure happinesse,<br>
A thousand sowres hath tempred with one sweet,<br>
To make it seeme more deare and dainty, as is meet.<p>

Like as is now befalne to this faire Mayd,<br>
Faire <i>Pastorell</i>, of whom is now my song,<br>
Who being now in dreadfull darknesse layd,<br>
Amongst those theeues, which her in bondage strong<br>
Detaynd, yet Fortune not with all this wrong<br>
Contented, greater mischiefe on her threw,<br>
And sorrowes heapt on her in greater throng;<br>
That who so heares her heauinesse, would rew<br>
And pitty her sad plight, so chang'd from pleasaunt hew.<p>

Whylest thus she in these hellish dens remayned,<br>
Wrapped in wretched cares and hearts vnrest,<br>
It so befell (as Fortune had ordayned)<br>
That he, which was their Capitaine profest,<br>
And had the chiefe commaund of all the rest,<br>
One day as he did all his prisoners vew,<br>
With lustfull eyes, beheld that louely guest,<br>
Faire <i>Pastorella</i>, whose sad mournefull hew<br>
Like the faire Morning clad in misty fog did shew.<p>

At sight whereof his barbarous heart was fired,<br>
And inly burnt with flames most raging whot,<br>
That her alone he for his part desired<br>
Of all the other pray, which they had got,<br>
And her in mynde did to him selfe allot.<br>
From that day forth he kyndnesse to her showed,<br>
And sought her loue, by all the meanes he mote;<br>
With looks, with words, with gifts he oft her wowed;<br>
And mixed threats among, and much vnto her vowed.<p>

But all that euer he could doe or say,<br>
Her constant mynd could not a whit remoue,<br>
Nor draw vnto the lure of his lewd lay,<br>
To graunt him fauour, or afford him loue.<br>
Yet ceast he not to sew and all waies proue,<br>
By which he mote accomplish his request,<br>
Saying and doing all that mote behoue;<br>
Ne day nor night he suffred her to rest,<br>
But her all night did watch, and all the day molest.<p>

At last, when him she so importune saw,<br>
Fearing least he at length the raines would lend<br>
Vnto his lust, and make his will his law,<br>
Sith in his powre she was to foe or frend;<br>
She thought it best, for shadow to pretend<br>
Some shew of fauour, by him gracing small,<br>
That she thereby mote either freely wend,<br>
Or at more ease continue there his thrall:<br>
A little well is lent, that gaineth more withall.<p>

So from thenceforth, when loue he to her made,<br>
With better tearmes she did him entertaine;<br>
Which gaue him hope, and did him halfe perswade,<br>
That he in time her ioyaunce should obtaine.<br>
But when she saw, through that small fauours gaine,<br>
That further, then she willing was, he prest;<br>
She found no meanes to barre him, but to faine<br>
A sodaine sickenesse, which her sore opprest,<br>
And made vnfit to serue his lawlesse mindes behest.<p>

By meanes whereof she would not him permit<br>
Once to approch to her in priuity,<br>
But onely mongst the rest by her to sit,<br>
Mourning the rigour of her malady,<br>
And seeking all things meete for remedy.<br>
But she resolu'd no remedy to fynde,<br>
Nor better cheare to shew in misery,<br>
Till Fortune would her captiue bonds vnbynde:<br>
Her sickenesse was not of the body but the mynde.<p>

During which space that she thus sicke did lie,<br>
It chaunst a sort of merchants, which were wount<br>
To skim those coastes, for bondmen there to buy,<br>
And by such trafficke after gaines to hunt,<br>
Arriued in this Isle though bare and blunt,<br>
T'inquire for slaues; where being readie met<br>
By some of these same theeues at the instant brunt,<br>
Were brought vnto their Captaine, who was set<br>
By his faire patients side with sorrowfull regret.<p>

To whom they shewed, how those marchants were<br>
Arriu'd in place, their bondslaues for to buy;<br>
And therefore prayd, that those same captiues there<br>
Mote to them for their most commodity<br>
Be sold, and mongst them shared equally.<br>
This their request the Captaine much appalled;<br>
Yet could he not their iust demaund deny,<br>
And willed streight the slaues should forth be called,<br>
And sold for most aduantage not to be forstalled.<p>

Then forth the good old <i>Meliboe</i> was brought,<br>
And <i>Coridon</i>, with many other moe,<br>
Whom they before in diuerse spoyles had caught:<br>
All which he to the marchants sale did showe.<br>
Till some, which did the sundry prisoners knowe,<br>
Gan to inquire for that faire shepherdesse,<br>
Which with the rest they tooke not long agoe,<br>
And gan her forme and feature to expresse,<br>
The more t'augment her price, through praise of comlinesse.<p>

To whom the Captaine in full angry wize<br>
Made answere, that the Mayd of whom they spake,<br>
Was his owne purchase and his onely prize,<br>
With which none had to doe, ne ought partake,<br>
But he himselfe, which did that conquest make;<br>
Litle for him to haue one silly lasse:<br>
Besides, through sicknesse now so wan and weake,<br>
That nothing meet in marchandise to passe.<br>
So shew'd them her, to proue how pale &amp; weake she was.<p>

The sight of whom, though now decayd and mard,<br>
And eke but hardly seene by candle-light:<br>
Yet like a Diamond of rich regard,<br>
In doubtfull shadow of the darkesome night,<br>
With starrie beames about her shining bright,<br>
These marchants fixed eyes did so amaze,<br>
That what through wonder, &amp; what through delight,<br>
Awhile on her they greedily did gaze,<br>
And did her greatly like, and did her greatly praize.<p>

At last when all the rest them offred were,<br>
And prises to them placed at their pleasure,<br>
They all refused in regard of her,<br>
Ne ought would buy, how euer prisd with measure,<br>
Withouten her, whose worth aboue all threasure<br>
They did esteeme, and offred store of gold.<br>
But then the Captaine fraught with more displeasure,<br>
Bad them be still, his loue should not be sold:<br>
The rest take if they would, he her to him would hold.<p>

Therewith some other of the chiefest theeues<br>
Boldly him bad such iniurie forbeare;<br>
For that same mayd, how euer it him greeues,<br>
Should with the rest be sold before him theare,<br>
To make the prises of the rest more deare.<br>
That with great rage he stoutly doth denay;<br>
And fiercely drawing forth his blade, doth sweare,<br>
That who so hardie hand on her doth lay,<br>
It dearely shall aby, and death for handsell pay.<p>

Thus as they words amongst them multiply,<br>
They fall to strokes, the frute of too much talke:<br>
And the mad steele about doth fiercely fly,<br>
Not sparing wight, ne leauing any balke,<br>
But making way for death at large to walke:<br>
Who in the horror of the griesly night,<br>
In thousand dreadful shapes doth mongst them stalke,<br>
And makes huge hauocke, whiles the candlelight<br>
Out quenched, leaues no skill nor difference of wight.<p>

Like as a sort of hungry dogs ymet<br>
About some carcase by the common way,<br>
Doe fall together, stryuing each to get<br>
The greatest portion of the greedie pray;<br>
All on confused heapes themselues assay,<br>
And snatch, and byte, and rend, and tug, and teare;<br>
That who them sees, would wonder at their fray,<br>
And who sees not, would be affrayd to heare:<br>
Such was the conflict of those cruell <i>Brigants</i> there.<p>

But first of all, their captiues they doe kill,<br>
Least they should ioyne against the weaker side,<br>
Or rise against the remnant at their will;<br>
Old <i>Meliboe</i> is slaine, and him beside<br>
His aged wife, with many others wide:<br>
But <i>Coridon</i> escaping craftily,<br>
Creepes forth of dores, whilst darknes him doth hide,<br>
And flyes away as fast as he can hye,<br>
Ne stayeth leaue to take, before his friends doe dye.<p>

But <i>Pastorella</i>, wofull wretched Elfe,<br>
Was by the Captaine all this while defended:<br>
Who minding more her safety then himselfe,<br>
His target alwayes ouer her pretended;<br>
By meanes whereof, that mote not be amended,<br>
He at the length was slaine, and layd on ground,<br>
Yet holding fast twixt both his armes extended<br>
Fayre <i>Pastorell</i>, who with the selfe same wound<br>
Lanc't through the arme, fell down with him in drerie swound.<p>

There lay she couered with confused preasse<br>
Of carcases, which dying on her fell.<br>
Tho when as he was dead, the fray gan ceasse,<br>
And each to other calling, did compell<br>
To stay their cruell hands from slaughter fell.<br>
Sith they that were the cause of all, were gone.<br>
Thereto they all attonce agreed well,<br>
And lighting candles new, gan search anone,<br>
How many of their friends were slaine, how many fone.<p>

Their Captaine there they cruelly found kild,<br>
And in his armes the dreary dying mayd,<br>
Like a sweet Angell twixt two clouds vphild:<br>
Her louely light was dimmed and decayd,<br>
With cloud of death vpon her eyes displayd;<br>
Yet did the cloud make euen that dimmed light<br>
Seeme much more louely in that darknesse layd,<br>
And twixt the twinckling of her eye-lids bright,<br>
To sparke out litle beames, like starres in foggie night.<p>

But when they mou'd the carcases aside,<br>
They found that life did yet in her remaine:<br>
Then all their helpes they busily applyde,<br>
To call the soule backe to her home againe;<br>
And wrought so well with labour and long paine,<br>
That they to life recouered her at last.<br>
Who sighing sore, as if her hart in twaine<br>
Had riuen bene, and all her hart strings brast,<br>
With drearie drouping eyne lookt vp like one aghast.<p>

There she beheld, that sore her grieu'd to see,<br>
Her father and her friends about her lying,<br>
Her selfe sole left, a second spoyle to bee<br>
Of those, that hauing saued her from dying,<br>
Renew'd her death by timely death denying:<br>
What now is left her, but to wayle and weepe,<br>
Wringing her hands, and ruefully loud crying?<br>
Ne cared she her wound in teares to steepe,<br>
Albe with all their might those <i>Brigants</i> her did keepe.<p>

But when they saw her now reliu'd againe,<br>
They left her so, in charge of one the best<br>
Of many worst, who with vnkind disdaine<br>
And cruell rigour her did much molest;<br>
Scarse yeelding her due food, or timely rest,<br>
And scarsely suffring her infestred wound,<br>
That sore her payn'd, by any to be drest,<br>
So leaue we her in wretched thraldome bound,<br>
And turne we backe to <i>Calidore</i>, where we him found.<p>

Who when he backe returned from the wood,<br>
And saw his shepheards cottage spoyled quight,<br>
And his Loue reft away, he wexed wood,<br>
And halfe enraged at that ruefull sight;<br>
That euen his hart for very fell despight,<br>
And his owne flesh he readie was to teare:<br>
He chauft, he grieu'd, he fretted, and he sigh't,<br>
And fared like a furious wyld Beare,<br>
Whose whelpes are stolne away, she being otherwhere.<p>

Ne wight he found, to whom he might complaine,<br>
Ne wight he found, of whom he might inquire;<br>
That more increast the anguish of his paine.<br>
He sought the woods; but no man could see there;<br>
He sought the plaines; but could no tydings heare.<br>
The woods did nought but ecchoes vaine rebound;<br>
The playnes all waste and emptie did appeare:<br>
Where wont the shepheards oft their pypes resound,<br>
And feed an hundred flocks, there now not one he found.<p>

At last as there he romed vp and downe,<br>
He chaunst one comming towards him to spy,<br>
That seem'd to be some sorie simple clowne,<br>
With ragged weedes, and lockes vpstaring hye,<br>
As if he did from some late daunger fly,<br>
And yet his feare did follow him behynd:<br>
Who as he vnto him approched nye,<br>
He mote perceiue by signes, which he did fynd,<br>
That <i>Coridon</i> it was, the silly shepherds hynd.<p>

Tho to him running fast, he did not stay<br>
To greet him first, but askt were where the rest;<br>
Where <i>Pastorell</i>? who full of fresh dismay,<br>
And gushing forth in teares, was so opprest,<br>
That he no word could speake, but smit his brest,<br>
And vp to heauen his eyes fast streming threw.<br>
Whereat the knight amaz'd, yet did not rest,<br>
But askt againe, what ment that rufull hew;<br>
Where was his <i>Pastorell</i>? where all the other crew?<p>

Ah well away (sayd he then sighing sore)<br>
That euer I did liue, this day to see,<br>
This dismall day, and was not dead before,<br>
Before I saw faire <i>Pastorella</i> dye.<br>
Die? out alas! then <i>Calidore</i> did cry:<br>
How could the death dare euer her to quell?<br>
But read thou shepheard, read what destiny,<br>
Or other dyrefull hap from heauen or hell<br>
Hath wrought this wicked deed: doe feare away, and tell.<p>

Tho when the shepheard breathed had awhile,<br>
He thus began: Where shall I then commence<br>
This wofull tale? or how those <i>Brigants</i> vyle,<br>
With cruell rage and dreadfull violence<br>
Spoyld all our cots, and caried vs from hence?<br>
Or how faire <i>Pastorell</i> should haue bene sold<br>
To marchants, but was sau'd with strong defence?<br>
Or how those theeues, whilest one sought her to hold,<br>
Fell all at ods, and fought through fury fierce and bold.<p>

In that same conflict (woe is me) befell<br>
This fatall chaunce, this dolefull accident,<br>
Whose heauy tydings now I haue to tell.<br>
First all the captiues, which they here had hent,<br>
Were by them slaine by generall consent;<br>
Old <i>Meliboe</i> and his good wife withall<br>
These eyes saw die, and dearely did lament:<br>
But when the lot to <i>Pastorell</i> did fall,<br>
Their Captaine long withstood, &amp; did her death forstall.<p>

But what could he gainst all them doe alone?<br>
It could not boot, needs mote she die at last:<br>
I onely scapt through great confusione<br>
Of cryes and clamors, which amongst them past,<br>
In dreadfull darknesse dreadfully aghast;<br>
That better were with them to haue bene dead,<br>
Then here to see all desolate and wast,<br>
Despoyled of those ioyes and iollyhead,<br>
Which with those gentle shepherds here I wont to lead.<p>

When <i>Calidore</i> these ruefull newes had raught,<br>
His hart quite deaded was with anguish great,<br>
And all his wits with doole were nigh distraught,<br>
That he his face, his head, his brest did beat,<br>
And death it selfe vnto himselfe did threat;<br>
Oft cursing th'heauens, that so cruell were<br>
To her, whose name he often did repeat;<br>
And wishing oft, that he were present there,<br>
When she was slaine, or had bene to her succour nere.<p>

But after griefe awhile had had his course,<br>
And spent it selfe in mourning, he at last<br>
Began to mitigate his swelling sourse,<br>
And in his mind with better reason cast,<br>
How he might saue her life, if life did last;<br>
Or if that dead, how he her death might wreake,<br>
Sith otherwise he could not mend thing past;<br>
Or if it to reuenge he were too weake,<br>
Then for to die with her, and his liues threed to breake.<p>

Tho <i>Coridon</i> he prayd, sith he well knew<br>
The readie way vnto that theeuish wonne,<br>
To wend with him, and be his conduct trew<br>
Vnto the place, to see what should be donne.<br>
But he, whose hart through feare was late fordonne,<br>
Would not for ought be drawne to former drede,<br>
But by all meanes the daunger knowne did shonne:<br>
Yet <i>Calidore</i> so well him wrought with meed,<br>
And faire bespoke with words, that he at last agreed.<p>

So forth they goe together (God before)<br>
Both clad in shepheards weeds agreeably,<br>
And both with shepheards hookes: But <i>Calidore</i><br>
Had vnderneath, him armed priuily.<br>
Tho to the place when they approched nye,<br>
They chaunst, vpon an hill not farre away,<br>
Some flockes of sheepe and shepheards to espy;<br>
To whom they both agreed to take their way,<br>
In hope there newes to learne, how they mote best assay.<p>

There did they find, that which they did not feare,<br>
The selfe same flocks, the which those theeues had reft<br>
From <i>Meliboe</i> and from themselues whyleare,<br>
And certaine of the theeues there by them left,<br>
The which for want of heards themselues then kept.<br>
Right well knew <i>Coridon</i> his owne late sheepe,<br>
And seeing them, for tender pittie wept:<br>
But when he saw the theeues, which did them keepe,<br>
His hart gan fayle, albe he saw them all asleepe.<p>

But <i>Calidore</i> recomforting his griefe,<br>
Though not his feare; for nought may feare disswade;<br>
Him hardly forward drew, whereas the thiefe<br>
Lay sleeping soundly in the bushes shade,<br>
Whom <i>Coridon</i> him counseld to inuade<br>
Now all vnwares, and take the spoyle away;<br>
But he, that in his mind had closely made<br>
A further purpose, would not so them slay,<br>
But gently waking them, gaue them the time of day.<p>

Tho sitting downe by them vpon the greene,<br>
Of sundrie things he purpose gan to faine;<br>
That he by them might certaine tydings weene<br>
Of <i>Pastorell</i>, were she aliue or slaine.<br>
Mongst which the theeues them questioned againe,<br>
What mister men, and eke from whence they were.<br>
To whom they answer'd, as did appertaine,<br>
That they were poore heardgroomes, the which whylere<br>
Had from their maisters fled, &amp; now sought hyre elswhere.<p>

Whereof right glad they seem'd, and offer made<br>
To hyre them well, if they their flockes would keepe:<br>
For they themselues were euill groomes, they sayd,<br>
Vnwont with heards to watch, or pasture sheepe,<br>
But to forray the land, or scoure the deepe.<br>
Thereto they soone agreed, and earnest tooke,<br>
To keepe their flockes for litle hyre and chepe:<br>
For they for better hyre did shortly looke,<br>
So there all day they bode, till light the sky forsooke.<p>

Tho when as towards darksome night it drew,<br>
Vnto their hellish dens those theeues them brought;<br>
Where shortly they in great acquaintance grew,<br>
And all the secrets of their entrayles sought.<br>
There did they find, contrarie to their thought,<br>
That <i>Pastorell</i> yet liu'd, but all the rest<br>
Were dead, right so as <i>Coridon</i> had taught:<br>
Whereof they both full glad and blyth did rest,<br>
But chiefly <i>Calidore</i>, whom griefe had most possest.<p>

At length when they occasion fittest found,<br>
In dead of night, when all the theeues did rest<br>
After a late forray, and slept full sound,<br>
Sir <i>Calidore</i> him arm'd, as he thought best,<br>
Hauing of late by diligent inquest,<br>
Prouided him a sword of meanest sort:<br>
With which he streight went to the Captaines nest.<br>
But <i>Coridon</i> durst not with him consort,<br>
Ne durst abide behind, for dread of worse effort.<p>

When to the Caue they came, they found it fast:<br>
But <i>Calidore</i> with huge resistlesse might,<br>
The dores assayled, and the locks vpbrast.<br>
With noyse whereof the theefe awaking light,<br>
Vnto the entrance ran: where the bold knight<br>
Encountring him with small resistance slew;<br>
The whiles faire <i>Pastorell</i> through great affright<br>
Was almost dead, misdoubting least of new<br>
Some vprore were like that, which lately she did vew.<p>

But when as <i>Calidore</i> was comen in,<br>
And gan aloud for <i>Pastorell</i> to call;<br>
Knowing his voice although not heard long sin,<br>
She sudden was reuiued therewithall,<br>
And wondrous ioy felt in her spirits thrall:<br>
Like him that being long in tempest tost,<br>
Looking each houre into deathes mouth to fall,<br>
At length espyes at hand the happie cost,<br>
On which he safety hopes, that earst feard to be lost.<p>

Her gentle hart, that now long season past<br>
Had neuer ioyance felt, nor chearefull thought,<br>
Began some smacke of comfort new to tast,<br>
Like lyfull heat to nummed senses brought,<br>
And life to feele, that long for death had sought;<br>
Ne lesse in hart reioyced <i>Calidore</i>,<br>
When he her found, but like to one distraught,<br>
And robd of reason, towards her him bore,<br>
A thousand times embrast, and kist a thousand more.<p>

But now by this, with noyse of late vprore,<br>
The hue and cry was raysed all about;<br>
And all the <i>Brigants</i> flocking in great store,<br>
Vnto the caue gan preasse, nought hauing dout<br>
Of that was doen, and entred in a rout.<br>
But <i>Calidore</i> in th'entry close did stand,<br>
And entertayning them with courage stout,<br>
Still slew the formost, that came first to hand,<br>
So long till all the entry was with bodies mand.<p>

Tho when no more could nigh to him approch,<br>
He breath'd his sword, and rested him till day:<br>
Which when he spyde vpon the earth t'encroch,<br>
Through the dead carcases he made his way;<br>
Mongst which he found a sword of better say,<br>
With which he forth went into th'open light:<br>
Where all the rest for him did readie stay,<br>
And fierce assayling him, with all their might<br>
Gan all vpon him lay: there gan a dreadfull fight.<p>

How many flyes in whottest sommers day<br>
Do seize vpon some beast, whose flesh is bare,<br>
That all the place with swarmes do ouerlay,<br>
And with their litle stings right felly fare;<br>
So many theeues about him swarming are,<br>
All which do him assayle on euery side,<br>
And sore oppresse, ne any him doth spare:<br>
But he doth with his raging brond diuide<br>
Their thickest troups, &amp; round about him scattreth wide.<p>

Like as a Lion mongst an heard of dere,<br>
Disperseth them to catch his choysest pray;<br>
So did he fly amongst them here and there,<br>
And all that nere him came, did hew and slay,<br>
Till he had strowd with bodies all the way;<br>
That none his daunger daring to abide,<br>
Fled from his wrath, and did themselues conuay<br>
Into their caues, their heads from death to hide,<br>
Ne any left, that victorie to him enuide.<p>

Then backe returning to his dearest deare,<br>
He her gan to recomfort, all he might,<br>
With gladfull speaches, and with louely cheare,<br>
And forth her bringing to the ioyous light,<br>
Whereof she long had lackt the wishfull sight,<br>
Deuiz'd all goodly meanes, from her to driue<br>
The sad remembrance of her wretched plight.<br>
So her vneath at last he did reuiue,<br>
That long had lyen dead, and made againe aliue.<p>

This doen, into those theeuish dens he went,<br>
And thence did all the spoyles and threasures take,<br>
Which they from many long had robd and rent,<br>
But fortune now the victors meed did make;<br>
Of which the best he did his loue betake;<br>
And also all those flockes, which they before<br>
Had reft from <i>Meliboe</i>, and from his make,<br>
He did them all to <i>Coridon</i> restore.<br>
So droue them all away, and his loue with him bore.<p>
