<blockquote>
<i>Malbecco will no straunge knights host,<br>
For peeuish gealosie:<br>
Paridell giusts with Britomart:<br>
Both shew their auncestrie.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
R
Edoubted knights, and honorable Dames,<br>
To whom I leuell all my labours end,<br>
Right sore I feare, least with vnworthy blames<br>
This odious argument my rimes should shend,<br>
Or ought your goodly patience offend,<br>
Whiles of a wanton Lady I do write,<br>
Which with her loose incontinence doth blend<br>
The shyning glory of your soueraigne light,<br>
And knighthood fowle defaced by a faithlesse knight.<p>

But neuer let th'ensample of the bad<br>
Offend the good: for good by paragone<br>
Of euill, may more notably be rad,<br>
As white seemes fairer, macht with blacke attone;<br>
Ne all are shamed by the fault of one;<br>
For lo in heauen, whereas all goodnesse is,<br>
Emongst the Angels, a whole legione<br>
Of wicked Sprights did fall from happy blis;<br>
What wonder then, if one of women all did mis?<p>

Then listen Lordings, if ye list to weet<br>
The cause, why <i>Satyrane</i> and <i>Paridell</i><br>
Mote not be entertaynd, as seemed meet,<br>
Into that Castle (as that Squire does tell.)<br>
Therein a cancred crabbed Carle does dwell,<br>
That has no skill of Court nor courtesie,<br>
Ne cares, what men say of him ill or well;<br>
For all his dayes he drownes in priuitie,<br>
Yet has full large to liue, and spend at libertie.<p>

But all his mind is set on mucky pelfe,<br>
To hoord vp heapes of euill gotten masse,<br>
For which he others wrongs, and wreckes himselfe;<br>
Yet is he lincked to a louely lasse,<br>
Whose beauty doth her bounty far surpasse,<br>
The which to him both far vnequall yeares,<br>
And also far vnlike conditions has;<br>
For she does ioy to play emongst her peares,<br>
And to be free from hard restraint and gealous feares.<p>

But he is old, and withered like hay,<br>
Vnfit faire Ladies seruice to supply;<br>
The priuie guilt whereof makes him alway<br>
Suspect her truth, and keepe continuall spy<br>
Vpon her with his other blincked eye;<br>
Ne suffreth he resort of liuing wight<br>
Approch to her, ne keepe her company,<br>
But in close bowre her mewes from all mens sight,<br>
Depriu'd of kindly ioy and naturall delight.<p>

<i>Malbecco</i> he, and <i>Hellenore</i> she hight,<br>
Vnfitly yokt together in one teeme,<br>
That is the cause, why neuer any knight<br>
Is suffred here to enter, but he seeme<br>
Such, as no doubt of him he neede misdeeme.<br>
Thereat Sir <i>Satyrane</i> gan smile, and say;<br>
Extremely mad the man I surely deeme,<br>
That weenes with watch and hard restraint to stay<br>
A womans will, which is disposd to go astray.<p>

In vaine he feares that, which he cannot shonne:<br>
For who wotes not, that womans subtiltyes<br>
Can guilen <i>Argus</i>, when she list misdonne?<br>
It is not yron bandes, nor hundred eyes,<br>
Nor brasen walls, nor many wakefull spyes,<br>
That can withhold her wilfull wandring feet;<br>
But fast good will with gentle curtesyes,<br>
And timely seruice to her pleasures meet<br>
May her perhaps containe, that else would algates fleet.<p>


Then is he not more mad (said <i>Paridell</i>)<br>
That hath himselfe vnto such seruice sold,<br>
In dolefull thraldome all his dayes to dwell?<br>
For sure a foole I do him firmely hold,<br>
That loues his fetters, though they were of gold.<br>
But why do we deuise of others ill,<br>
Whiles thus we suffer this same dotard old,<br>
To keepe vs out, in scorne of his owne will,<br>
And rather do not ransack all, and him selfe kill?<p>

Nay let vs first (said <i>Satyrane</i>[)] entreat<br>
The man by gentle meanes, to let vs in,<br>
And afterwardes affray with cruell threat,<br>
Ere that we to efforce it do begin:<br>
Then if all fayle, we will by force it win,<br>
And eke reward the wretch for his mesprise,<br>
As may be worthy of his haynous sin.<br>
That counsell pleasd: then <i>Paridell</i> did rise,<br>
And to the Castle gate approcht in quiet wise.<p>

Whereat soft knocking, entrance he desyrd.<br>
The good man selfe, which then the Porter playd,<br>
Him answered, that all were now retyrd<br>
Vnto their rest, and all the keyes conuayd<br>
Vnto their maister, who in bed was layd,<br>
That none him durst awake out of his dreme;<br>
And therefore them of patience gently prayd.<br>
Then <i>Paridell</i> began to chaunge his theme,<br>
And threatned him with force &amp; punishment extreme.<p>

But all in vaine; for nought mote him relent,<br>
And now so long before the wicket fast<br>
They wayted, that the night was forward spent,<br>
And the faire welkin fowly ouercast,<br>
Gan blowen vp a bitter stormy blast,<br>
With shoure and hayle so horrible and dred,<br>
That this faire many were compeld at last,<br>
To fly for succour to a little shed,<br>
The which beside the gate for swine was ordered.<p>

It fortuned, soone after they were gone,<br>
Another knight, whom tempest thither brought,<br>
Came to that Castle, and with earnest mone,<br>
Like as the rest, late entrance deare besought;<br>
But like so as the rest he prayd for nought,<br>
For flatly he of entrance was refusd,<br>
Sorely thereat he was displeasd, and thought<br>
How to auenge himselfe so sore abusd,<br>
And euermore the Carle of curtesie accusd.<p>

But to auoyde th'intollerable stowre,<br>
He was compeld to seeke some refuge neare,<br>
And to that shed, to shrowd him from the showre,<br>
He came, which full of guests he found whyleare,<br>
So as he was not let to enter there:<br>
Whereat he gan to wex exceeding wroth,<br>
And swore, that he would lodge with them yfere,<br>
Or them dislodge, all were they liefe or loth;<br>
And so defide them each, and so defide them both.<p>

Both were full loth to leaue that needfull tent,<br>
And both full loth in darkenesse to debate;<br>
Yet both full liefe him lodging to haue lent,<br>
And both full liefe his boasting to abate;<br>
But chiefly <i>Paridell</i> his hart did grate,<br>
To heare him threaten so despightfully.<br>
As if he did a dogge to kenell rate,<br>
That durst not barke; and rather had he dy,<br>
Then when he was defide, in coward corner ly.<p>

Tho hastily remounting to his steed,<br>
He forth issew'd; like as a boistrous wind,<br>
Which in th'earthes hollow caues hath long bin hid,<br>
And shut vp fast within her prisons blind,<br>
Makes the huge element against her kind<br>
To moue, and tremble as it were agast,<br>
Vntill that it an issew forth may find;<br>
Then forth it breakes, and with his furious blast<br>
Confounds both land &amp; seas, and skyes doth ouercast.<p>

Their steel-hed speares they strongly coucht, and met<br>
Together with impetuous rage and forse,<br>
That with the terrour of their fierce affret,<br>
They rudely droue to ground both man and horse,<br>
That each awhile lay like a sencelesse corse.<br>
But <i>Paridell</i> sore brused with the blow,<br>
Could not arise, the counterchaunge to scorse,<br>
Till that young Squire him reared from below;<br>
Then drew he his bright sword, &amp; gan about him throw.<p>

But <i>Satyrane</i> forth stepping, did them stay<br>
And with faire treatie pacifide their ire,<br>
Then when they were accorded from the fray,<br>
Against that Castles Lord they gan conspire,<br>
To heape on him dew vengeaunce for his hire.<br>
They bene agreed, and to the gates they goe<br>
To burne the same with vnquenchable fire,<br>
And that vncurteous Carle their commune foe<br>
To do fowle death to dye, or wrap in grieuous woe.<p>

<i>Malbecco</i> seeing them resolu'd in deed<br>
To flame the gates, and hearing them to call<br>
For fire in earnest, ran with fearefull speed,<br>
And to them calling from the castle wall,<br>
Besought them humbly, him to beare withal,<br>
As ignoraunt of seruants bad abuse,<br>
And slacke attendaunce vnto straungers call.<br>
The knights were willing all things to excuse,<br>
Though nought beleu'd, &amp; entra&#361;ce late did not refuse.<p>

They bene ybrought into a comely bowre,<br>
And seru'd of all things that mote needfull bee;<br>
Yet secretly their hoste did on them lowre,<br>
And welcomde more for feare, then charitee;<br>
But they dissembled, what they did not see,<br>
And welcomed themselues.  Each gan vndight<br>
Their garments wet, and weary armour free,<br>
To dry them selues by <i>Vulcanes</i> flaming light,<br>
And eke their lately bruzed parts to bring in plight.<p>

And eke that straunger knight emongst the rest;<br>
Was for like need enforst to disaray:<br>
Tho whenas vailed was her loftie crest,<br>
Her golden locks, that were in tramels gay<br>
Vpbounden, did them selues adowne display,<br>
And raught vnto her heeles; like sunny beames,<br>
That in a cloud their light did long time stay,<br>
Their vapour vaded, shew their golden gleames,<br>
And through the persant aire shoote forth their azure streames.<p>

She also dofte her heauy haberieon,<br>
Which the faire feature of her limbs did hyde,<br>
And her well plighted frock, which she did won<br>
To tucke about her short, when she did ryde,<br>
She low let fall, that flowd from her lanck syde<br>
Downe to her foot, with carelesse modestee.<br>
Then of them all she plainly was espyde,<br>
To be a woman wight, vnwist to bee,<br>
The fairest woman wight, that euer eye did see.<p>

Like as <i>Minerua</i>, being late returnd<br>
From slaughter of the Giaunts conquered;<br>
Where proud <i>Encelade</i>, whose wide nosethrils burnd<br>
With breathed flames, like to a furnace red,<br>
Transfixed with the speare, downe tombled ded<br>
From top of <i>Hemus</i>, by him heaped hye;<br>
Hath loosd her helmet from her lofty hed,<br>
And her <i>Gorgonian</i> shield gins to vntye<br>
From her left arme, to rest in glorious victorye.<p>

Which whenas they beheld, they smitten were<br>
With great amazement of so wondrous sight,<br>
And each on other, and they all on her<br>
Stood gazing, as if suddein great affright<br>
Had them surprised.  At last auizing right,<br>
Her goodly personage and glorious hew,<br>
Which they so much mistooke, they tooke delight<br>
In their first errour, and yet still anew<br>
With wonder of her beauty fed their hungry vew.<p>

Yet note their hungry vew be satisfide,<br>
But seeing still the more desir'd to see,<br>
And euer firmely fixed did abide<br>
In contemplation of diuinitie:<br>
But most they meruail[e]d at her cheualree,<br>
And noble prowesse, which they had approued,<br>
That much they faynd to know, who she mote bee;<br>
Yet none of all them her thereof amoued,<br>
Yet euery one her likte, and euery one her loued.<p>

And <i>Paridell</i> though partly discontent<br>
With his late fall, and fowle indignity,<br>
Yet was soone wonne his malice to relent,<br>
Through gracious regard of her faire eye,<br>
And knightly worth, which he too late did try,<br>
Yet tried did adore.  Supper was dight;<br>
Then they <i>Malbecco</i> prayd of curtesy,<br>
That of his Lady they might haue the sight,<br>
And company at meat, to do them more delight.<p>

But he to shift their curious request,<br>
Gan causen, why she could not come in place;<br>
Her crased health, her late recourse to rest,<br>
And humid euening ill for sicke folkes cace:<br>
But none of those excuses could take place;<br>
Ne would they eate, till she in presence came.<br>
She came in presence with right comely grace,<br>
And fairely them saluted, as became,<br>
And shewd her selfe in all a gentle curteous Dame.<p>

They sate to meat, and <i>Satyrane</i> his chaunce<br>
Was her before, and <i>Paridell</i> besyde;<br>
But he him selfe sate looking still askaunce,<br>
Gainst <i>Britomart</i>, and euer closely eyde<br>
Sir <i>Satyrane</i>, that glaunces might not glyde:<br>
But his blind eye, that syded <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
All his demeasnure from his sight did hyde:<br>
On her faire face so did he feede his fill,<br>
And sent close messages of loue to her at will.<p>

And euer and anone, when none was ware,<br>
With speaking lookes, that close embassage bore,<br>
He rou'd at her, and told his secret care:<br>
For all that art he learned had of yore.<br>
Ne was she ignoraunt of that lewd lore,<br>
But in his eye his meaning wisely red,<br>
And with the like him answerd euermore:<br>
She sent at him one firie dart, whose hed<br>
Empoisned was with priuy lust, and gealous dred.<p>

He from that deadly throw made no defence,<br>
But to the wound his weake hart opened wyde;<br>
The wicked engine through false influence,<br>
Past through his eyes, and secretly did glyde<br>
Into his hart, which it did sorely gryde.<br>
But nothing new to him was that same paine,<br>
Ne paine at all; for he so oft had tryde<br>
The powre thereof, and lou'd so oft in vaine,<br>
That thing of course he counted, loue to entertaine.<p>

Thenceforth to her he sought to intimate<br>
His inward griefe, by meanes to him well knowne,<br>
Now <i>Bacchus</i> fruit out of the siluer plate<br>
He on the table dasht, as ouerthrowne,<br>
Or of the fruitfull liquor ouerflowne,<br>
And by the dauncing bubbles did diuine,<br>
Or therein write to let his loue be showne;<br>
Which well she red out of the learned line,<br>
A sacrament prophane in mistery of wine.<p>

And when so of his hand the pledge she raught,<br>
The guilty cup she fained to mistake,<br>
And in her lap did shed her idle draught,<br>
Shewing desire her inward flame to slake:<br>
By such close signes they secret way did make<br>
Vnto their wils, and one eyes watch escape;<br>
Two eyes him needeth, for to watch and wake,<br>
Who louers will deceiue.  Thus was the ape,<br>
By their faire handling, put into <i>Malbeccoes</i> cape.<p>

Now when of meats and drinks they had their fill,<br>
Purpose was moued by that gentle Dame,<br>
Vnto those knights aduenturous, to tell<br>
Of deeds of armes, which vnto them became,<br>
And euery one his kindred, and his name.<br>
Then <i>Paridell</i>, in whom a kindly pryde<br>
Of gracious speach, and skill his words to frame<br>
Abounded, being glad of so fit tyde<br>
Him to commend to her, thus spake, of all well eyde.<p>

<i>Troy</i>, that art now nought, but an idle name,<br>
And in thine ashes buried low dost lie,<br>
Though whilome far much greater then thy fame,<br>
Before that angry Gods, and cruell skye<br>
Vpon thee heapt a direfull destinie,<br>
What boots it boast thy glorious descent,<br>
And fetch from heauen thy great Genealogie,<br>
Sith all thy worthy prayses being blent,<br>
Their of-spring hath embaste, and later glory shent.<p>

Most famous Worthy of the world, by whome<br>
That warre was kindled, which did <i>Troy</i> inflame,<br>
And stately towres of <i>Ilion</i> whilome<br>
Brought vnto balefull ruine, was by name<br>
Sir <i>Paris</i> far renowmd through noble fame,<br>
Who through great prowesse and bold hardinesse,<br>
From <i>Laced&aelig;mon</i> fetcht the fairest Dame,<br>
That euer <i>Greece</i> did boast, or knight possesse,<br>
Whom <i>Venus</i> to him gaue for meed of worthinesse.<p>

Faire <i>Helene</i>, flowre of beautie excellent,<br>
And girlond of the mighty Conquerours,<br>
That madest many Ladies deare lament<br>
The heauie losse of their braue Paramours,<br>
Which they far off beheld from <i>Troian</i> toures,<br>
And saw the fieldes of faire <i>Scamander</i> strowne<br>
With carcases of noble warrioures,<br>
Whose fruitlesse liues were vnder furrow sowne,<br>
And <i>Xanthus</i> sandy bankes with bloud all ouerflowne.<p>

From him my linage I deriue aright,<br>
Who long before the ten yeares siege of <i>Troy</i>,<br>
Whiles yet on <i>Ida</i> he a shepheard hight,<br>
On faire <i>Oenone</i> got a louely boy,<br>
Whom for remembraunce of her passed ioy,<br>
She of his Father <i>Parius</i> did name;<br>
Who, after <i>Greekes</i> did <i>Priams</i> realme destroy,<br>
Gathred the <i>Troian</i> reliques sau'd from flame,<br>
And with them sayling thence, to th'Isle of <i>Paros</i> came.<p>

That was by him cald <i>Paros</i>, which before<br>
Hight <i>Nausa</i>, there he many yeares did raine,<br>
And built <i>Nausicle</i> by the <i>Pontick</i> shore,<br>
The which he dying left next in remaine<br>
To <i>Paridas</i> his sonne.<br>
From whom I <i>Paridell</i> by kin descend;<br>
But for faire Ladies loue, and glories gaine,<br>
My natiue soile haue left, my dayes to spend<br>
In sewing deeds of armes, my liues and labours end.<p>

Whenas the noble <i>Britomart</i> heard tell<br>
Of <i>Troian</i> warres, and <i>Priams</i> Citie sackt,<br>
The ruefull story of Sir <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
She was empassiond at that piteous act,<br>
With zelous enuy of Greekes cruell fact,<br>
Against that nation, from whose race of old<br>
She heard, that she was lineally extract:<br>
For noble <i>Britons</i> sprong from <i>Troians</i> bold,<br>
And <i>Troynouant</i> was built of old <i>Troyes</i> ashes cold.<p>

Then sighing soft awhile, at last she thus:<br>
O lamentable fall of famous towne,<br>
Which raignd so many yeares victorious,<br>
And of all <i>Asie</i> bore the soueraigne crowne,<br>
In one sad night consumd, and throwen downe:<br>
What stony hart, that heares thy haplesse fate,<br>
Is not empierst with deepe compassiowne,<br>
And makes ensample of mans wretched state,<br>
That floures so fresh at morne, and fades at euening late?<p>

Behold, Sir, how your pitifull complaint<br>
Hath found another partner of your payne:<br>
For nothing may impresse so deare constraint,<br>
As countries cause, and commune foes disdayne.<br>
But if it should not grieue you, backe agayne<br>
To turne your course, I would to heare desyre,<br>
What to <i>Aeneas</i> fell; sith that men sayne<br>
He was not in the Cities wofull fyre<br>
Consum'd, but did him selfe to safetie retyre.<p>

<i>Anchyses</i> sonne begot of <i>Venus</i> faire,<br>
(Said he,) out of the flames for safegard fled,<br>
And with a remnant did to sea repaire,<br>
Where he through fatall errour long was led<br>
Full many yeares, and weetlesse wandered<br>
From shore to shore, emongst the Lybicke sands,<br>
Ere rest he found.  Much there he suffered,<br>
And many perils past in forreine lands,<br>
To saue his people sad from victours vengefull hands.<p>

At last in <i>Latium</i> he did arriue,<br>
Where he with cruell warre was entertaind<br>
Of th'inland folke, which sought him backe to driue,<br>
Till he with old <i>Latinus</i> was constraind,<br>
To contract wedlock: (so the fates ordaind.)<br>
Wedlock contract in bloud, and eke in blood<br>
Accomplished, that many deare complaind:<br>
The riuall slaine, the victour through the flood<br>
Escaped hardly, hardly praisd his wedlock good.<p>

Yet after all, he victour did suruiue,<br>
And with <i>Latinus</i> did the kingdome part.<br>
But after when both nations gan to striue,<br>
Into their names the title to conuart,<br>
His sonne <i>Iulus</i> did from thence depart,<br>
With all the warlike youth of <i>Troians</i> bloud,<br>
And in long <i>Alba</i> plast his throne apart,<br>
Where faire it florished, and long time it stoud,<br>
Till <i>Romulus</i> renewing it, to <i>Rome</i> remoud.<p>

There there (said <i>Britomart</i>) a fresh appeard<br>
The glory of the later world to spring,<br>
And <i>Troy</i> againe out of her dust was reard,<br>
To sit in second seat of soueraigne king,<br>
Of all the world vnder her gouerning.<br>
But a third kingdome yet is to arise,<br>
Out of the <i>Troians</i> scattered of-spring,<br>
That in all glory and great enterprise,<br>
Both first and second <i>Troy</i> shall dare to equalise.<p>

It <i>Troynouant</i> is hight, that with the waues<br>
Of wealthy <i>Thamis</i> washed is along,<br>
Vpon whose stubborne neck, whereat he raues<br>
With roring rage, and sore him selfe does throng,<br>
That all men feare to tempt his billowes strong,<br>
She fastned hath her foot, which standes so hy,<br>
That it a wonder of the world is song<br>
In forreine landes, and all which passen by,<br>
Beholding it from far, do thinke it threates the skye.<p>

The <i>Troian Brute</i> did first that Citie found,<br>
And Hygate made the meare thereof by West,<br>
And <i>Ouert</i> gate by North: that is the bound<br>
Toward the land; two riuers bound the rest.<br>
So huge a scope at first him seemed best,<br>
To be the compasse of his kingdomes seat:<br>
So huge a mind could not in lesser rest,<br>
Ne in small meares containe his glory great,<br>
That <i>Albion</i> had conquered first by warlike feat.<p>

Ah fairest Lady knight, (said <i>Paridell</i>)<br>
Pardon I pray my heedlesse ouersight,<br>
Who had forgot, that whilome I heard tell<br>
From aged <i>Mnemon</i>; for my wits bene light.<br>
Indeed he said (if I remember right,)<br>
That of the antique <i>Troian</i> stocke, there grew<br>
Another plant, that raught to wondrous hight,<br>
And far abroad his mighty branches threw,<br>
Into the vtmost Angle of the world he knew.<p>

For that same <i>Brute</i>, whom much he did aduaunce<br>
In all his speach, was <i>Syluius</i> his sonne,<br>
Whom hauing slaine, through luckles arrowes gla&#361;ce<br>
He fled for feare of that he had misdonne,<br>
Or else for shame, so fowle reproch to shonne,<br>
And with him led to sea an youthly trayne,<br>
Where wearie wandring they long time did wonne,<br>
And many fortunes prou'd in th'<i>Ocean</i> mayne,<br>
And great adu&#7869;tures found, that now were l&otilde;g to sayne.<p>

At last by fatall course they driuen were<br>
Into an Island spatious and brode,<br>
The furthest North, that did to them appeare:<br>
Which after rest they seeking far abrode,<br>
Found it the fittest soyle for their abode,<br>
Fruitfull of all things fit for liuing foode,<br>
But wholy wast, and void of peoples trode,<br>
Saue an huge nation of the Geaunts broode,<br>
That fed on liuing flesh, &amp; druncke mens vitall blood.<p>

Whom he through wearie wars and labours long,<br>
Subdewd with losse of many <i>Britons</i> bold:<br>
In which the great <i>Goemagot</i> of strong<br>
<i>Corineus</i>, and <i>Coulin</i> of <i>Debon</i> old<br>
Were ouerthrowne and layd on th'earth full cold,<br>
Which quaked vnder their so hideous masse,<br>
A famous history to be enrold<br>
In euerlasting moniments of brasse,<br>
That all the antique Worthies merits far did passe.<p>

His worke great <i>Troynouant</i>, his worke is eke<br>
Faire <i>Lincolne</i>, both renowmed far away,<br>
That who from East to West will endlong seeke,<br>
Cannot two fairer Cities find this day,<br>
Except <i>Cleopolis:</i> so heard I say<br>
Old <i>Mnemon</i>.  Therefore Sir, I greet you well<br>
Your countrey kin, and you entirely pray<br>
Of pardon for the strife, which late befell<br>
Betwixt vs both vnknowne.  So ended <i>Paridell</i>.<p>

But all the while, that he these speaches spent,<br>
Vpon his lips hong faire Dame <i>Hellenore</i>,<br>
With vigilant regard, and dew attent,<br>
Fashioning worlds of fancies euermore<br>
In her fraile wit, that now her quite forlore:<br>
The whiles vnwares away her wondring eye,<br>
And greedy eares her weake hart from her bore:<br>
Which he perceiuing, euer priuily<br>
In speaking, many false belgardes at her let fly.<p>

So long these knights discoursed diuersly,<br>
Of straunge affaires, and noble hardiment,<br>
Which they had past with mickle ieopardy,<br>
That now the humid night was farforth spent,<br>
And heauenly lampes were halfendeale ybrent:<br>
Which th'old man seeing well, who too long thought<br>
Euery discourse and euery argument,<br>
Which by the houres he measured, besought<br>
Them go to rest. So all vnto their bowres were brought.<p>
