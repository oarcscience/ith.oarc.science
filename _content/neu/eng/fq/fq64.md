*Cant. XII.*

> *Artegall doth Sir Burbon aide,  
> And blames for changing shield:  
> He with the great Grantorto fights,  
> And slaieth him in field.*

> O Sacred hunger of ambitious mindes,  
> And impotent desire of men to raine,  
> Whom neither dread of God, that deuils bindes,  
> Nor lawes of men, that common weales containe,  
> Nor bands of nature, that wilde beastes restraine,  
> Can keepe from outrage, and from doing wrong,  
> Where they may hope a kingdome to obtaine.  
> No faith so firme, no trust can be so strong,  
> No loue so lasting then, that may enduren long.
>
> Witnesse may *Burbon* be, whom all the bands,  
> Which may a Knight assure, had surely bound,  
> Vntill the loue of Lordship and of lands  
> Made him become most faithlesse and vnsound:  
> And witnesse be *Gerioneo* found,  
> Who for like cause faire *Belge* did oppresse,  
> And right and wrong most cruelly confound:  
> And so be now *Grantorto*, who no lesse  
> Then all the rest burst out to all outragiousnesse.
>
> Gainst whom Sir *Artegall*, long hauing since  
> Taken in hand th'exploit, being theretoo  
> Appointed by that mightie Faerie Prince,  
> Great *Gloriane*, that Tyrant to fordoo,  
> Through other great aduentures hethertoo  
> Had it forslackt. But now time drawing ny,  
> To him assynd, her high beheast to doo,  
> To the sea shore he gan his way apply,  
> To weete if shipping readie he mote there descry.
>
> Tho when they came to the sea coast, they found  
> A ship all readie (as good fortune fell)  
> To put to sea, with whom they did compound,  
> To passe them ouer, where them list to tell:  
> The winde and weather serued them so well,  
> That in one day they with the coast did fall;  
> Whereas they readie found them to repell,  
> Great hostes of men in order martiall,  
> Which them forbad to land, and footing did forstall.
>
> But nathemore would they from land refraine,  
> But when as nigh vnto the shore they drew,  
> That foot of man might sound the bottome plaine,  
> *Talus* into the sea did forth issew,  
> Though darts from shore and stones they at him threw;  
> And wading through the waues with stedfast sway,  
> Maugre the might of all those troupes in vew,  
> Did win the shore, whence he them chast away,  
> And made to fly, like doues, whom the Eagle doth affray.
>
> The whyles Sir *Artegall*, with that old knight  
> Did forth descend, there being none them neare,  
> And forward marched to a towne in sight.  
> By this came tydings to the Tyrants eare,  
> By those, which earst did fly away for feare  
> Of their arriuall: wherewith troubled sore,  
> He all his forces streight to him did reare,  
> And forth issuing with his scouts afore,  
> Meant them to haue incountred, ere they left the shore.
>
> But ere he marched farre, he with them met,  
> And fiercely charged them with all his force;  
> But *Talus* sternely did vpon them set,  
> And brusht, and battred them without remorse,  
> That on the ground he left full many a corse;  
> Ne any able was him to withstand,  
> But he them ouerthrew both man and horse,  
> That they lay scattred ouer all the land,  
> As thicke as doth the seede after the sowers hand;
>
> Till *Artegall* him seeing so to rage,  
> Willd him to stay, and signe of truce did make:  
> To which all harkning, did a while asswage  
> Their forces furie, and their terror slake;  
> Till he an Herauld cald, and to him spake,  
> Willing him wend vnto the Tyrant streight,  
> And tell him that not for such slaughters sake  
> He thether came, but for to trie the right  
> Of fayre *Irenaes* cause with him in single fight.
>
> And willed him for to reclayme with speed  
> His scattred people, ere they all were slaine,  
> And time and place conuenient to areed,  
> In which they two the combat might darraine.  
> Which message when *Grantorto* heard, full fayne  
> And glad he was the slaughter so to stay,  
> And pointed for the combat twixt them twayne  
> The morrow next, ne gaue him longer day;  
> So sounded the retraite, and drew his folke away.
>
> That night Sir *Artegall* did cause his tent  
> There to be pitched on the open plaine;  
> For he had giuen streight commaundement,  
> That none should dare him once to entertaine:  
> Which none durst breake, though many would right faine  
> For fayre *Irena*, whom they loued deare.  
> But yet old *Sergis* did so well him paine,  
> That from close friends, that dar'd not to appeare,  
> He all things did puruay, which for them needfull weare.
>
> The morrow next, that was the dismall day,  
> Appointed for *Irenas* death before,  
> So soone as it did to the world display  
> His chearefull face, and light to men restore,  
> The heauy Mayd, to whom none tydings bore  
> Of *Artegals* arryuall, her to free,  
> Lookt vp with eyes full sad and hart full sore;  
> Weening her lifes last howre then neare to bee,  
> Sith no redemption nigh she did nor heare nor see.
>
> Then vp she rose, and on her selfe did dight  
> Most squalid garments, fit for such a day,  
> And with dull countenance, and with doleful spright,  
> She forth was brought in sorrowfull dismay,  
> For to receiue the doome of her decay.  
> But comming to the place, and finding there  
> Sir *Artegall*, in battailous array  
> Wayting his foe, it did her dead hart cheare,  
> And new life to her lent, in midst of deadly feare.
>
> Like as a tender Rose in open plaine,  
> That with vntimely drought nigh withered was,  
> And hung the head, soone as few drops of raine  
> Thereon distill, and deaw her daintie face,  
> Gins to looke vp, and with fresh wonted grace  
> Dispreds the glorie of her leaues gay;  
> Such was *Irenas* countenance, such her case,  
> When *Artegall* she saw in that array,  
> There wayting for the Tyrant, till it was farre day.
>
> Who came at length, with proud presumpteous gate,  
> Into the field, as if he fearelesse were,  
> All armed in a cote of yron plate,  
> Of great defence to ward the deadly feare,  
> And on his head a steele cap he did weare  
> Of colour rustie browne, but sure and strong;  
> And in his hand an huge Polaxe did beare,  
> Whose steale was yron studded, but not long,  
> With which he wont to fight, to iustifie his wrong.
>
> Of stature huge and hideous he was,  
> Like to a Giant for his monstrous hight,  
> And did in strength most sorts of men surpas,  
> Ne euer any found his match in might;  
> Thereto he had great skill in single fight:  
> His face was vgly, and his countenance sterne,  
> That could haue frayd one with the very sight,  
> And gaped like a gulfe, when he did gerne,  
> That whether man or monster one could scarse discerne.
>
> Soone as he did within the listes appeare,  
> With dreadfull looke he *Artegall* beheld,  
> As if he would haue daunted him with feare,  
> And grinning griesly, did against him weld  
> His deadly weapon, which in hand he held.  
> But th'Elfin swayne, that oft had seene like sight,  
> Was with his ghastly count'nance nothing queld,  
> But gan him streight to buckle to the fight,  
> And cast his shield about, to be in readie plight.
>
> The trompets sound, and they together goe,  
> With dreadfull terror, and with fell intent;  
> And their huge strokes full daungerously bestow,  
> To doe most dammage, where as most they ment.  
> But with such force and furie violent,  
> The tyrant thundred his thicke blowes so fast,  
> That through the yron walles their way they rent,  
> And euen to the vitall parts they past,  
> Ne ought could them endure, but all they cleft or brast.
>
> Which cruell outrage when as *Artegall*  
> Did well auize, thenceforth with warie heed  
> He shund his strokes, where euer they did fall,  
> And way did giue vnto their gracelesse speed:  
> As when a skilfull Marriner doth reed  
> A storme approching, that doth perill threat,  
> He will not bide the daunger of such dread,  
> But strikes his sayles, and vereth his mainsheat,  
> And lends vnto it leaue the emptie ayre to beat.
>
> So did the Faerie knight himselfe abeare,  
> And stouped oft his head from shame to shield;  
> No shame to stoupe, ones head more high to reare,  
> And much to gaine, a litle for to yield;  
> So stoutest knights doen oftentimes in field.  
> But still the tyrant sternely at him layd,  
> And did his yron axe so nimbly wield,  
> That many wounds into his flesh it made,  
> And with his burdenous blowes him sore did ouerlade.
>
> Yet when as fit aduantage he did spy,  
> The whiles the cursed felon high did reare  
> His cruell hand, to smite him mortally,  
> Vnder his stroke he to him stepping neare,  
> Right in the flanke him strooke with deadly dreare,  
> That the gore bloud thence gushing grieuously,  
> Did vnderneath him like a pond appeare,  
> And all his armour did with purple dye;  
> Thereat he brayed loud, and yelled dreadfully.
>
> Yet the huge stroke, which he before intended,  
> Kept on his course, as he did it direct,  
> And with such monstrous poise adowne descended,  
> That seemed nought could him from death protect:  
> But he it well did ward with wise respect,  
> And twixt him and the blow his shield did cast,  
> Which thereon seizing, tooke no great effect;  
> But byting deepe therein did sticke so fast,  
> That by no meanes it backe againe he forth could wrast.
>
> Long while he tug'd and stroue, to get it out,  
> And all his powre applyed thereunto,  
> That he therewith the knight drew all about:  
> Nathlesse, for all that euer he could doe,  
> His axe he could not from his shield vndoe.  
> Which *Artegall* perceiuing, strooke no more,  
> But loosing soone his shield, did it forgoe,  
> And whiles he combred was therewith so sore,  
> He gan at him let driue more fiercely then afore.
>
> So well he him pursew'd, that at the last,  
> He stroke him with *Chrysaor* on the hed,  
> That with the souse thereof full sore aghast,  
> He staggered to and fro in doubtfull sted.  
> Againe whiles he him saw so ill bested,  
> He did him smite with all his might and maine,  
> That falling on his mother earth he fed:  
> Whom when he saw prostrated on the plaine,  
> He lightly reft his head, to ease him of his paine.
>
> Which when the people round about him saw,  
> They shouted all for ioy of his successe,  
> Glad to be quit from that proud Tyrants awe,  
> Which with strong powre did them long time oppresse;  
> And running all with greedie ioyfulnesse  
> To faire *Irena*, at her feet did fall,  
> And her adored with due humblenesse,  
> As their true Liege and Princesse naturall;  
> And eke her champions glorie sounded ouer all.
>
> Who streight her leading with meete maiestie  
> Vnto the pallace, where their kings did rayne,  
> Did her therein establish peaceablie,  
> And to her kingdomes seat restore agayne;  
> And all such persons, as did late maintayne  
> That Tyrants part, with close or open ayde,  
> He sorely punished with heauie payne;  
> That in short space, whiles there with her he stayd,  
> Not one was left, that durst her once haue disobayd.
>
> During which time, that he did there remaine,  
> His studie was true Iustice how to deale,  
> And day and night employ'd his busie paine  
> How to reforme that ragged common-weale:  
> And that same yron man which could reueale  
> All hidden crimes, through all that realme he sent,  
> To search out those, that vsd to rob and steale,  
> Or did rebell gainst lawfull gouernment;  
> On whom he did inflict most grieuous punishment.
>
> But ere he could reforme it thoroughly,  
> He through occasion called was away,  
> To Faerie Court, that of necessity  
> His course of Iustice he was forst to stay,  
> And *Talus* to reuoke from the right way,  
> In which he was that Realme for to redresse.  
> But enuies cloud still dimmeth vertues ray.  
> So hauing freed *Irena* from distresse,  
> He tooke his leaue of her, there left in heauinesse.
>
> Tho as he backe returned from that land,  
> And there arriu'd againe, whence forth he set,  
> He had not passed farre vpon the strand,  
> When as two old ill fauour'd Hags he met,  
> By the way side being together set,  
> Two griesly creatures; and, to that their faces  
> Most foule and filthie were, their garments yet  
> Being all rag'd and tatter'd, their disgraces  
> Did much the more augment, and made most vgly cases.
>
> The one of them, that elder did appeare,  
> With her dull eyes did seeme to looke askew,  
> That her mis-shape much helpt; and her foule heare  
> Hung loose and loathsomely: Thereto her hew  
> Was wan and leane, that all her teeth arew,  
> And all her bones might through her cheekes be red;  
> Her lips were like raw lether, pale and blew,  
> And as she spake, therewith she slauered;  
> Yet spake she seldom, but thought more, the lesse she sed.
>
> Her hands were foule and durtie, neuer washt  
> In all her life, with long nayles ouer raught,  
> Like puttocks clawes: with th'one of which she scracht  
> Her cursed head, although it itched naught;  
> The other held a snake with venime fraught,  
> On which she fed, and gnawed hungrily,  
> As if that long she had not eaten ought;  
> That round about her iawes one might descry  
> The bloudie gore and poyson dropping lothsomely.
>
> Her name was *Enuie*, knowen well thereby;  
> Whose nature is to grieue, and grudge at all,  
> That euer she sees doen prays-worthily,  
> Whose sight to her is greatest crosse, may fall,  
> And vexeth so, that makes her eat her gall.  
> For when she wanteth other thing to eat,  
> She feedes on her owne maw vnnaturall,  
> And of her owne foule entrayles makes her meat;  
> Meat fit for such a monsters monsterous dyeat.
>
> And if she hapt of any good to heare,  
> That had to any happily betid,  
> Then would she inly fret, and grieue, and teare  
> Her flesh for felnesse, which she inward hid:  
> But if she heard of ill, that any did,  
> Or harme, that any had, then would she make  
> Great cheare, like one vnto a banquet bid;  
> And in anothers losse great pleasure take,  
> As she had got thereby, and gayned a great stake.
>
> The other nothing better was, then shee;  
> Agreeing in bad will and cancred kynd,  
> But in bad maner they did disagree:  
> For what so *Enuie* good or bad did fynd,  
> She did conceale, and murder her owne mynd;  
> But this, what euer euill she conceiued,  
> Did spred abroad, and throw in th'open wynd.  
> Yet this in all her words might be perceiued,  
> That all she sought, was mens good name to haue bereaued.
>
> For what soeuer good by any sayd,  
> Or doen she heard, she would streightwayes inuent,  
> How to depraue, or slaunderously vpbrayd,  
> Or to misconstrue of a mans intent,  
> And turne to ill the thing, that well was ment.  
> Therefore she vsed often to resort,  
> To common haunts, and companies frequent,  
> To hearke what any one did good report,  
> To blot the same with blame, or wrest in wicked sort.
>
> And if that any ill she heard of any,  
> She would it eeke, and make much worse by telling,  
> And take great ioy to publish it to many,  
> That euery matter worse was for her melling,  
> Her name was hight *Detraction*, and her dwelling  
> Was neare to *Enuie*, euen her neighbour next;  
> A wicked hag, and *Enuy* selfe excelling  
> In mischiefe: for her selfe she onely vext;  
> But this same both her selfe, and others eke perplext.
>
> Her face was vgly, and her mouth distort,  
> Foming with poyson round about her gils,  
> In which her cursed tongue full sharpe and short  
> Appear'd like Aspis sting, that closely kils,  
> Or cruelly does wound, whom so she wils:  
> A distaffe in her other hand she had,  
> Vpon the which she litle spinnes, but spils,  
> And faynes to weaue false tales and leasings bad,  
> To throw amongst the good, which others had disprad.
>
> These two now had themselues combynd in one,  
> And linckt together gainst Sir *Artegall*,  
> For whom they wayted as his mortall fone,  
> How they might make him into mischiefe fall,  
> For freeing from their snares *Irena* thrall:  
> Besides vnto themselues they gotten had  
> A monster, which the *Blatant beast* men call,  
> A dreadfull feend of gods and men ydrad,  
> Whom they by slights allur'd, and to their purpose lad.
>
> Such were these Hags, and so vnhandsome drest:  
> Who when they nigh approching, had espyde  
> Sir *Artegall* return'd from his late quest,  
> They both arose, and at him loudly cryde,  
> As it had bene two shepheards curres, had scryde  
> A rauenous Wolfe amongst the scattered flockes.  
> And *Enuie* first, as she that first him eyde,  
> Towardes him runs, and with rude flaring lockes  
> About her eares, does beat her brest, & forhead knockes.
>
> Then from her mouth the gobbet she does take,  
> The which whyleare she was so greedily  
> Deuouring, euen that halfe-gnawen snake,  
> And at him throwes it most despightfully.  
> The cursed Serpent, though she hungrily  
> Earst chawd thereon, yet was not all so dead,  
> But that some life remayned secretly,  
> And as he past afore withouten dread,  
> Bit him behind, that long the marke was to be read.
>
> Then th'other comming neare, gan him reuile,  
> And fouly rayle, with all she could inuent;  
> Saying, that he had with vnmanly guile,  
> And foule abusion both his honour blent,  
> And that bright sword, the sword of Iustice lent,  
> Had stayned with reprochfull crueltie,  
> In guiltlesse blood of many an innocent:  
> As for *Grandtorto*, him with treacherie  
> And traynes hauing surpriz'd, he fouly did to die.
>
> Thereto the Blatant beast by them set on  
> At him began aloud to barke and bay,  
> With bitter rage and fell contention,  
> That all the woods and rockes nigh to that way,  
> Began to quake and tremble with dismay;  
> And all the aire rebellowed againe.  
> So dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray,  
> And euermore those hags them selues did paine,  
> To sharpen him, and their owne cursed tongs did straine.
>
> And still among most bitter wordes they spake,  
> Most shamefull, most vnrighteous, most vntrew,  
> That they the mildest man aliue would make  
> Forget his patience, and yeeld vengeaunce dew  
> To her, that so false sclaunders at him threw.  
> And more to make thẽ pierce & wound more deepe,  
> She with the sting, which in her vile tongue grew,  
> Did sharpen them, and in fresh poyson steepe:  
> Yet he past on, and seem'd of them to take no keepe.
>
> But *Talus* hearing her so lewdly raile,  
> And speake so ill of him, that well deserued,  
> Would her haue chastiz'd with his yron flaile,  
> If her Sir *Artegall* had not preserued,  
> And him forbidden, who his heast obserued.  
> So much the more at him still did she scold,  
> And stones did cast, yet he for nought would swerue  
> From his right course, but still the way did hold  
> To Faery Court, where what him fell shall else be told.
