*Cant. VI.*

> *Both Scudamour and Arthegall  
> Doe fight with Britomart:  
> He sees her face; doth fall in loue,  
> and soone from her depart.*

> VV Hat equall torment to the griefe of mind,  
> And pyning anguish hid in gentle hart,  
> That inly feeds it selfe with thoughts vnkind,  
> And nourisheth her owne consuming smart?  
> What medicine can any Leaches art  
> Yeeld such a sore, that doth her grieuance hide,  
> And will to none her maladie impart?  
> Such was the wound that *Scudamour* did gride;  
> For which *Dan Phebus* selfe cannot a salue prouide.
>
> Who hauing left that restlesse house of *Care*,  
> The next day, as he on his way did ride,  
> Full of melancholie and sad misfare,  
> Through misconceipt; all vnawares espide  
> An armed Knight vnder a forrest side,  
> Sitting in shade beside his grazing steede;  
> Who soone as them approaching he descride,  
> Gan towards them to pricke with eger speede,  
> That seem'd he was full bent to some mischieuous deede.
>
> Which *Scudamour* perceiuing, forth issewed  
> To haue rencountred him in equall race;  
> But soone as th'other nigh approaching, vewed  
> The armes he bore, his speare he gan abase,  
> And voide his course: at which so suddain case  
> He wondred much. But th'other thus can say;  
> Ah gentle *Scudamour*, vnto your grace  
> I me submit, and you of pardon pray,  
> That almost had against you trespassed this day.
>
> Whereto thus *Scudamour*, Small harme it were  
> For any knight, vpon a ventrous knight  
> Without displeasance for to proue his spere.  
> But reade you Sir, sith ye my name haue hight,  
> What is your owne, that I mote you requite?  
> Certes (sayd he) ye mote as now excuse  
> Me from discouering you my name aright:  
> For time yet serues that I the same refuse,  
> But call ye me the *Saluage Knight*, as others vse.
>
> Then this, Sir *Saluage Knight* (quoth he) areede;  
> Or doe you here within this forrest wonne,  
> That seemeth well to answere to your weede?  
> Or haue ye it for some occasion donne?  
> That rather seemes, sith knowen armes ye shonne.  
> This other day (sayd he) a stranger knight  
> Shame and dishonour hath vnto me donne;  
> On whom I waite to wreake that foule despight,  
> When euer he this way shall passe by day or night.
>
> Shame be his meede (quoth he) that meaneth shame.  
> But what is he, by whom ye shamed were?  
> A stranger knight, sayd he, vnknowne by name,  
> But knowne by fame, and by an Hebene speare,  
> With which he all that met him, downe did beare.  
> He in an open Turney lately held,  
> Fro me the honour of that game did reare;  
> And hauing me all wearie earst, downe feld,  
> The fayrest Ladie reft, and euer since withheld.
>
> When *Scudamour* heard mention of that speare,  
> He wist right well, that it was *Britomart*,  
> The which from him his fairest loue did beare.  
> Tho gan he swell in euery inner part,  
> For fell despight, and gnaw his gealous hart,  
> That thus he sharply sayd; Now by my head,  
> Yet is not this the first vnknightly part,  
> Which that same knight, whom by his launce I read,  
> Hath doen to noble knights, that many makes him dread.
>
> For lately he my loue hath fro me reft,  
> And eke defiled with foule villanie  
> The sacred pledge, which in his faith was left,  
> In shame of knighthood and fidelitie;  
> The which ere long full deare he shall abie.  
> And if to that auenge by you decreed  
> This hand may helpe, or succour ought supplie,  
> It shall not fayle, when so ye shall it need.  
> So both to wreake their wrathes on *Britomart* agreed.
>
> Whiles thus they communed, lo farre away  
> A Knight soft ryding towards them they spyde,  
> Attyr'd in forraine armes and straunge aray:  
> Whõ when they nigh approcht, they plaine descryde  
> To be the same, for whom they did abyde.  
> Sayd then Sir *Scudamour*, Sir *Saluage* knight  
> Let me this craue, sith first I was defyde,  
> That first I may that wrong to him requite:  
> And if I hap to fayle, you shall recure my right.
>
> Which being yeelded, he his threatfull speare  
> Gan fewter, and against her fiercely ran.  
> Who soone as she him saw approaching neare  
> With so fell rage, her selfe she lightly gan  
> To dight, to welcome him, well as she can:  
> But entertaind him in so rude a wise,  
> That to the ground she smote both horse and man;  
> Whence neither greatly hasted to arise,  
> But on their common harmes together did deuise.
>
> But *Artegall* beholding his mischaunce,  
> New matter added to his former fire;  
> And eft auentring his steeleheaded launce,  
> Against her rode, full of despiteous ire,  
> That nought but spoyle and vengeance did require.  
> But to himselfe his felonous intent  
> Returning, disappointed his desire,  
> Whiles vnawares his saddle he forwent,  
> And found himselfe on ground in great amazement.
>
> Lightly he started vp out of that stound,  
> And snatching forth his direfull deadly blade,  
> Did leape to her, as doth an eger hound  
> Thrust to an Hynd within some couert glade,  
> Whom without perill he cannot inuade.  
> With such fell greedines he her assayled,  
> That though she mounted were, yet he her made  
> To giue him ground, (so much his force preuayled)  
> And shun his mightie strokes, gainst which no armes auayled.
>
> So as they coursed here and there, it chaunst  
> That in her wheeling round, behind her crest  
> So sorely he her strooke, that thence it glaunst  
> Adowne her backe, the which it fairely blest  
> From foule mischance; ne did it euer rest,  
> Till on her horses hinder parts it fell;  
> Where byting deepe, so deadly it imprest,  
> That quite it chynd his backe behind the sell,  
> And to alight on foote her algates did compell.
>
> Like as the lightning brond from riuen skie,  
> Throwne out by angry *Ioue* in his vengeance,  
> With dreadfull force falles on some steeple hie;  
> Which battring, downe it on the church doth glance,  
> And teares it all with terrible mischance.  
> Yet she no whit dismayd, her steed forsooke,  
> And casting from her that enchaunted lance,  
> Vnto her sword and shield her soone betooke;  
> And therewithall at him right furiously she strooke.
>
> So furiously she strooke in her first heat,  
> Whiles with long fight on foot he breathlesse was,  
> That she him forced backward to retreat,  
> And yeeld vnto her weapon way to pas:  
> Whose raging rigour neither steele nor bras  
> Could stay, but to the tender flesh it went,  
> And pour'd the purple bloud forth on the gras;  
> That all his mayle yriv'd, and plates yrent,  
> Shew'd all his bodie bare vnto the cruell dent.
>
> At length when as he saw her hastie heat  
> Abate, and panting breath begin to fayle,  
> He through long sufferance growing now more great,  
> Rose in his strength, and gan her fresh assayle,  
> Heaping huge strokes, as thicke as showre of hayle,  
> And lashing dreadfully at euery part,  
> As if he thought her soule to disentrayle.  
> Ah cruell hand, and thrise more cruell hart,  
> That workst such wrecke on her, to whom thou dearest art.
>
> What yron courage euer could endure,  
> To worke such outrage on so faire a creature?  
> And in his madnesse thinke with hands impure  
> To spoyle so goodly workmanship of nature,  
> The maker selfe resembling in her feature?  
> Certes some hellish furie, or some feend  
> This mischiefe framd, for their first loues defeature,  
> To bath their hands in bloud of dearest freend,  
> Thereby to make their loues beginning, their liues end.
>
> Thus long they trac'd, and trauerst to and fro,  
> Sometimes pursewing, and sometimes pursewed,  
> Still as aduantage they espyde thereto:  
> But toward th'end Sir *Arthegall* renewed  
> His strength still more, but she still more decrewed.  
> At last his lucklesse hand he heau'd on hie,  
> Hauing his forces all in one accrewed,  
> And therewith stroke at her so hideouslie,  
> That seemed nought but death mote be her destinie.
>
> The wicked stroke vpon her helmet chaunst,  
> And with the force, which in it selfe it bore,  
> Her ventayle shard away, and thence forth glaunst  
> A downe in vaine, ne harm'd her any more.  
> With that her angels face, vnseene afore,  
> Like to the ruddie morne appeard in sight,  
> Deawed with siluer drops, through sweating sore;  
> But somewhat redder, then beseem'd aright,  
> Through toylesome heate and labour of her weary fight.
>
> And round about the same, her yellow heare  
> Hauing through stirring loosd their wonted band,  
> Like to a golden border did appeare,  
> Framed in goldsmithes forge with cunning hand:  
> Yet goldsmithes cunning could not vnderstand  
> To frame such subtile wire, so shinie cleare.  
> For it did glister like the golden sand,  
> The which *Pactolus* with his waters shere,  
> Throwes forth vpon the riuage round about him nere.
>
> And as his hand he vp againe did reare,  
> Thinking to worke on her his vtmost wracke,  
> His powrelesse arme benumbd with secret feare  
> From his reuengefull purpose shronke abacke,  
> And cruell sword out of his fingers slacke  
> Fell downe to ground, as if the steele had sence,  
> And felt some ruth, or sence his hand did lacke,  
> Or both of them did thinke, obedience  
> To doe to so diuine a beauties excellence.
>
> And he himselfe long gazing thereupon,  
> At last fell humbly downe vpon his knee,  
> And of his wonder made religion,  
> Weening some heauenly goddesse he did see,  
> Or else vnweeting, what it else might bee;  
> And pardon her besought his errour frayle,  
> That had done outrage in so high degree:  
> Whilest trembling horrour did his sense assayle,  
> And made ech member quake, and manly hart to quayle.
>
> Nathelesse she full of wrath for that late stroke,  
> All that long while vpheld her wrathfull hand,  
> With fell intent, on him to bene ywroke,  
> And looking sterne, still ouer him did stand,  
> Threatning to strike, vnlesse he would withstand:  
> And bad him rise, or surely he should die.  
> But die or liue for nought he would vpstand  
> But her of pardon prayd more earnestlie,  
> Or wreake on him her will for so great iniurie.
>
> Which when as *Scudamour*, who now abrayd,  
> Beheld, whereas he stood not farre aside,  
> He was therewith right wondrously dismayd,  
> And drawing nigh, when as he plaine descride  
> That peerelesse paterne of Dame natures pride,  
> And heauenly image of perfection,  
> He blest himselfe, as one sore terrifide,  
> And turning his feare to faint deuotion,  
> Did worship her as some celestiall vision.
>
> But *Glauce*, seeing all that chaunced there,  
> Well weeting how their errour to assoyle,  
> Full glad of so good end, to them drew nere,  
> And her salewd with seemely belaccoyle,  
> Ioyous to see her safe after long toyle.  
> Then her besought, as she to her was deare,  
> To graunt vnto those warriours truce a whyle;  
> Which yeelded, they their beuers vp did reare,  
> And shew'd themselues to her, such as indeed they were.
>
> When *Britomart* with sharpe auizefull eye  
> Beheld the louely face of *Artegall*,  
> Tempred with sternesse and stout maiestie,  
> She gan eftsoones it to her mind to call,  
> To be the same which in her fathers hall  
> Long since in that enchaunted glasse she saw.  
> Therewith her wrathfull courage gan appall,  
> And haughtie spirits meekely to adaw,  
> That her enhaunced hand she downe can soft withdraw.
>
> Yet she it forst to haue againe vpheld,  
> As fayning choler, which was turn'd to cold:  
> But euer when his visage she beheld,  
> Her hand fell downe, and would no longer hold  
> The wrathfull weapon gainst his countnance bold:  
> But when in vaine to fight she oft assayd,  
> She arm'd her tongue, and thought at him to scold;  
> Nathlesse her tongue not to her will obayd,  
> But brought forth speeches myld, when she would haue missayd.
>
> But *Scudamour* now woxen inly glad,  
> That all his gealous feare he false had found,  
> And how that Hag his loue abused had  
> With breach of faith and loyaltie vnsound,  
> The which long time his grieued hart did wound,  
> He thus bespake; Certes Sir *Artegall*,  
> I ioy to see you lout so low on ground,  
> And now become to liue a Ladies thrall,  
> That whylome in your minde wont to despise them all.
>
> Soone as she heard the name of *Artegall*,  
> Her hart did leape, and all her hart-strings tremble,  
> For sudden ioy, and secret feare withall,  
> And all her vitall powres with motion nimble,  
> To succour it, themselues gan there assemble,  
> That by the swift recourse of flushing blood  
> Right plaine appeard, though she it would dissemble,  
> And fayned still her former angry mood,  
> Thinking to hide the depth by troubling of the flood.
>
> When *Glauce* thus gan wisely all vpknit;  
> Ye gentle Knights, whom fortune here hath brought,  
> To be spectators of this vncouth fit,  
> Which secret fate hath in this Ladie wrought,  
> Against the course of kind, ne meruaile nought,  
> Ne thenceforth feare the thing that hethertoo  
> Hath troubled both your mindes with idle thought,  
> Fearing least she your loues away should woo,  
> Feared in vaine, sith meanes ye see there wants theretoo.
>
> And you Sir *Artegall*, the saluage knight,  
> Henceforth may not disdaine, that womans hand  
> Hath conquered you anew in second fight:  
> For whylome they haue conquerd sea and land,  
> And heauen it selfe, that nought may them withstand,  
> Ne henceforth be rebellious vnto loue,  
> That is the crowne of knighthood, and the band  
> Of noble minds deriued from aboue,  
> Which being knit with vertue, neuer will remoue.
>
> And you faire Ladie knight, my dearest Dame,  
> Relent the rigour of your wrathfull will,  
> Whose fire were better turn'd to other flame;  
> And wiping out remembrance of all ill,  
> Graunt him your grace, but so that he fulfill  
> The penance, which ye shall to him empart:  
> For louers heauen must passe by sorrowes hell.  
> Thereat full inly blushed *Britomart*;  
> But *Artegall* close smyling ioy'd in secret hart.
>
> Yet durst he not make loue so suddenly,  
> Ne thinke th'affection of her hart to draw  
> From one to other so quite contrary:  
> Besides her modest countenance he saw  
> So goodly graue, and full of princely aw,  
> That it his ranging fancie did refraine,  
> And looser thoughts to lawfull bounds withdraw;  
> Whereby the passion grew more fierce and faine,  
> Like to a stubborne steede whom strong hand would restraine.
>
> But *Scudamour* whose hart twixt doubtfull feare  
> And feeble hope hung all this while suspence,  
> Desiring of his *Amoret* to heare  
> Some gladfull newes and sure intelligence,  
> Her thus bespake; But Sir without offence  
> Mote I request you tydings of my loue,  
> My *Amoret*, sith you her freed fro thence,  
> Where she captiued long, great woes did proue;  
> That where ye left, I may her seeke, as doth behoue.
>
> To whom thus *Britomart*, Certes Sir knight,  
> What is of her become, or whether reft,  
> I can not vnto you aread a right.  
> For from that time I from enchaunters theft  
> Her freed, in which ye her all hopelesse left,  
> I her preseru'd from perill and from feare,  
> And euermore from villenie her kept:  
> Ne euer was there wight to me more deare  
> Then she, ne vnto whom I more true loue did beare.
>
> Till on a day as through a desert wyld  
> We trauelled, both wearie of the way  
> We did alight, and sate in shadow myld;  
> Where fearelesse I to sleepe me downe did lay.  
> But when as I did out of sleepe abray,  
> I found her not, where I her left whyleare,  
> But thought she wandred was, or gone astray.  
> I cal'd her loud, I sought her farre and neare;  
> But no where could her find, nor tydings of her heare.
>
> When *Scudamour* those heauie tydings heard,  
> His hart was thrild with point of deadly feare;  
> Ne in his face or bloud or life appeard,  
> But senselesse stood, like to a mazed steare,  
> That yet of mortall stroke the stound doth beare.  
> Till *Glauce* thus; Faire Sir, be nought dismayd  
> With needelesse dread, till certaintie ye heare:  
> For yet she may be safe though somewhat strayd;  
> Its best to hope the best, though of the worst affrayd.
>
> Nathlesse he hardly of her chearefull speech  
> Did comfort take, or in his troubled sight  
> Shew'd change of better cheare: so sore a breach  
> That sudden newes had made into his spright;  
> Till *Britomart* him fairely thus behight;  
> Great cause of sorrow certes Sir ye haue:  
> But comfort take: for by this heauens light  
> I vow, you dead or liuing not to leaue,  
> Till I her find, and wreake on him that her did reaue.
>
> Therewith he rested, and well pleased was.  
> So peace being confirm'd amongst them all,  
> They tooke their steeds, and forward thence did pas  
> Vnto some resting place, which mote befall,  
> All being guided by Sir *Artegall*.  
> Where goodly solace was vnto them made,  
> And dayly feasting both in bowre and hall,  
> Vntill that they their wounds well healed had,  
> And wearie limmes recur'd after late vsage bad.
>
> In all which time, Sir *Artegall* made way  
> Vnto the loue of noble *Britomart*,  
> And with meeke seruice and much suit did lay  
> Continuall siege vnto her gentle hart;  
> Which being whylome launcht with louely dart,  
> More eath was new impression to receiue,  
> How euer she her paynd with womanish art  
> To hide her wound, that none might it perceiue:  
> Vaine is the art that seekes it selfe for to deceiue.
>
> So well he woo'd her, and so well he wrought her,  
> With faire entreatie and sweet blandishment,  
> That at the length vnto a bay he brought her,  
> So as she to his speeches was content  
> To lend an eare, and softly to relent.  
> At last through many vowes which forth he pour'd,  
> And many othes, she yeelded her consent  
> To be his loue, and take him for her Lord,  
> Till they with mariage meet might finish that accord.
>
> Tho when they had long time there taken rest,  
> Sir *Artegall*, who all this while was bound  
> Vpon an hard aduenture yet in quest,  
> Fit time for him thence to depart it found,  
> To follow that, which he did long propound;  
> And vnto her his congee came to take.  
> But her therewith full sore displeasd he found,  
> And loth to leaue her late betrothed make,  
> Her dearest loue full loth so shortly to forsake.
>
> Yet he with strong perswasions her asswaged,  
> And wonne her will to suffer him depart;  
> For which his faith with her he fast engaged,  
> And thousand vowes from bottome of his hart  
> That all so soone as he by wit or art  
> Could that atchieue, whereto he did aspire,  
> He vnto her would speedily reuert:  
> No longer space thereto he did desire,  
> But till the horned moone three courses did expire.
>
> With which she for the present was appeased,  
> And yeelded leaue, how euer malcontent  
> She inly were, and in her mind displeased.  
> So early in the morrow next he went  
> Forth on his way, to which he was ybent.  
> Ne wight him to attend, or way to guide,  
> As whylome was the custome ancient  
> Mongst Knights, when on aduentures they did ride,  
> Saue that she algates him a while accompanide.
>
> And by the way she sundry purpose found  
> Of this or that, the time for to delay,  
> And of the perils whereto he was bound,  
> The feare whereof seem'd much her to affray:  
> But all she did was but to weare out day.  
> Full oftentimes she leaue of him did take;  
> And eft againe deuiz'd some what to say,  
> Which she forgot, whereby excuse to make:  
> So loth she was his companie for to forsake.
>
> At last when all her speeches she had spent,  
> And new occasion fayld her more to find,  
> She left him to his fortunes gouernment,  
> And backe returned with right heauie mind,  
> To *Scudamour*, who she had left behind:  
> With whom she went to seeke faire *Amoret*,  
> Her second care, though in another kind;  
> For vertues onely sake, which doth beget  
> True loue and faithfull friendship, she by her did set.
>
> Backe to that desert forrest they retyred,  
> Where sorie *Britomart* had lost her late;  
> There they her sought, and euery where inquired,  
> Where they might tydings get of her estate;  
> Yet found they none. But by what haplesse fate,  
> Or hard misfortune she was thence conuayd,  
> And stolne away from her beloued mate,  
> Were long to tell; therefore I here will stay  
> Vntill another tyde, that I it finish may.
