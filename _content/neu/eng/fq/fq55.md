*Cant. III.*

> *The spousals of faire Florimell,  
> where turney many knights:  
> There Braggadochio is vncas'd  
> in all the Ladies sights.*

> A Fter long stormes and tempests ouerblowne,  
> The sunne at length his ioyous face doth cleare:  
> So when as fortune all her spight hath showne,  
> Some blisfull houres at last must needes appeare;  
> Else should afflicted wights oftimes despeire.  
> So comes it now to *Florimell* by tourne,  
> After long sorrowes suffered whyleare,  
> In which captiu'd she many moneths did mourne,  
> To tast of ioy, and to wont pleasures to retourne.
>
> Who being freed from *Proteus* cruell band  
> By *Marinell*, was vnto him affide,  
> And by him brought againe to Faerie land;  
> Where he her spous'd, and made his ioyous bride.  
> The time and place was blazed farre and wide;  
> And solemne feasts and giusts ordain'd therefore.  
> To which there did resort from euery side  
> Of Lords and Ladies infinite great store;  
> Ne any Knight was absent, that braue courage bore.
>
> To tell the glorie of the feast that day,  
> The goodly seruice, the deuicefull sights,  
> The bridegromes state, the brides most rich array,  
> The pride of Ladies, and the worth of knights,  
> The royall banquets, and the rare delights,  
> Were worke fit for an Herauld, not for me:  
> But for so much as to my lot here lights,  
> That with this present treatise doth agree,  
> True vertue to aduance, shall here recounted bee.
>
> When all men had with full satietie  
> Of meates and drinkes their appetites suffiz'd,  
> To deedes of armes and proofe of cheualrie  
> They gan themselues addresse, full rich aguiz'd,  
> As each one had his furnitures deuiz'd.  
> And first of all issu'd Sir *Marinell*,  
> And with him sixe knights more, which enterpriz'd  
> To chalenge all in right of *Florimell*,  
> And to maintaine, that she all others did excell.
>
> The first of them was hight Sir *Orimont*,  
> A noble Knight, and tride in hard assayes:  
> The second had to name Sir *Bellisont*,  
> But second vnto none in prowesse prayse;  
> The third was *Brunell*, famous in his dayes;  
> The fourth *Ecastor*, of exceeding might;  
> The fift *Armeddan*, skild in louely layes;  
> The sixt was *Lansack*, a redoubted Knight:  
> All sixe well seene in armes, and prou'd in many a fight.
>
> And them against came all that list to giust,  
> From euery coast and countrie vnder sunne:  
> None was debard, but all had leaue that lust.  
> The trompets sound; then all together ronne.  
> Full many deedes of armes that day were donne,  
> And many knights vnhorst, and many wounded,  
> As fortune fell; yet litle lost or wonne:  
> But all that day the greatest prayse redounded  
> To *Marinell*, whose name the Heralds loud resounded.
>
> The second day, so soone as morrow light  
> Appear'd in heauen, into the field they came,  
> And there all day continew'd cruell fight,  
> With diuers fortune fit for such a game,  
> In which all stroue with perill to winne fame.  
> Yet whether side was victor, note be ghest:  
> But at the last the trompets did proclame  
> That *Marinell* that day deserued best.  
> So they disparted were, and all men went to rest.
>
> The third day came, that should due tryall lend  
> Of all the rest, and then this warlike crew  
> Together met, of all to make an end.  
> There *Marinell* great deeds of armes did shew;  
> And through the thickest like a Lyon flew,  
> Rashing off helmes, and ryuing plates a sonder,  
> That euery one his daunger did eschew.  
> So terribly his dreadfull strokes did thonder,  
> That all men stood amaz'd, & at his might did wonder.
>
> But what on earth can alwayes happie stand?  
> The greater prowesse greater perils find.  
> So farre he past amongst his enemies band,  
> That they haue him enclosed so behind,  
> As by no meanes he can himselfe outwind.  
> And now perforce they haue him prisoner taken;  
> And now they doe with captiue bands him bind;  
> And now they lead him thence, of all forsaken,  
> Vnlesse some succour had in time him ouertaken.
>
> It fortun'd whylest they were thus ill beset,  
> Sir *Artegall* into the Tilt-yard came,  
> With *Braggadochio*, whom he lately met  
> Vpon the way, with that his snowy Dame.  
> Where when he vnderstood by common fame,  
> What euill hap to *Marinell* betid,  
> He much was mou'd at so vnworthie shame,  
> And streight that boaster prayd, with whom he rid,  
> To change his shield with him, to be better hid.
>
> So forth he went, and soone them ouer hent,  
> Where they were leading *Marinell* away,  
> Whom he assayld with dreadlesse hardiment,  
> And forst the burden of their prize to stay.  
> They were an hundred knights of that array;  
> Of which th'one halfe vpon himselfe did set,  
> The other stayd behind to gard the pray.  
> But he ere long the former fiftie bet;  
> And from the other fiftie soone the prisoner fet.
>
> So backe he brought Sir *Marinell* againe;  
> Whom hauing quickly arm'd againe anew,  
> They both together ioyned might and maine,  
> To set afresh on all the other crew.  
> Whom with sore hauocke soone they ouerthrew,  
> And chaced quite out of the field, that none  
> Against them durst his head to perill shew.  
> So were they left Lords of the field alone:  
> So *Marinell* by him was rescu'd from his fone.
>
> Which when he had perform'd, then backe againe  
> To *Braggadochio* did his shield restore:  
> Who all this while behind him did remaine,  
> Keeping there close with him in pretious store  
> That his false Ladie, as ye heard afore.  
> Then did the trompets sound, and Iudges rose,  
> And all these knights, which that day armour bore,  
> Came to the open hall, to listen whose  
> The honour of the prize should be adiudg'd by those.
>
> And thether also came in open sight  
> Fayre *Florimell*, into the common hall,  
> To greet his guerdon vnto euery knight,  
> And best to him, to whom the best should fall.  
> Then for that stranger knight they loud did call,  
> To whom that day they should the girlond yield.  
> Who came not forth, but for Sir *Artegall*  
> Came *Braggadochio*, and did shew his shield,  
> Which bore the Sunne brode blazed in a golden field.
>
> The sight whereof did all with gladnesse fill:  
> So vnto him they did addeeme the prise  
> Of all that Tryumph. Then the trompets shrill  
> Don *Braggadochios* name resounded thrise:  
> So courage lent a cloke to cowardise.  
> And then to him came fayrest *Florimell*,  
> And goodly gan to greet his braue emprise,  
> And thousand thankes him yeeld, that had so well  
> Approu'd that day, that she all others did excell.
>
> To whom the boaster, that all knights did blot,  
> With proud disdaine did scornefull answere make;  
> That what he did that day, he did it not  
> For her, but for his owne deare Ladies sake,  
> Whom on his perill he did vndertake,  
> Both her and eke all others to excell:  
> And further did vncomely speaches crake.  
> Much did his words the gentle Ladie quell,  
> And turn'd aside for shame to heare, what he did tell.
>
> Then forth he brought his snowy *Florimele*,  
> Whom *Trompart* had in keeping there beside,  
> Couered from peoples gazement with a vele.  
> Whom when discouered they had throughly eide,  
> With great amazement they were stupefide;  
> And said, that surely *Florimell* it was,  
> Or if it were not *Florimell* so tride,  
> That *Florimell* her selfe she then did pas.  
> So feeble skill of perfect things the vulgar has.
>
> Which when as *Marinell* beheld likewise,  
> He was therewith exceedingly dismayd;  
> Ne wist he what to thinke, or to deuise,  
> But like as one, whom feends had made affrayd,  
> He long astonisht stood, ne ought he sayd,  
> Ne ought he did, but with fast fixed eies  
> He gazed still vpon that snowy mayd;  
> Whom euer as he did the more auize,  
> The more to be true *Florimell* he did surmize.
>
> As when two sunnes appeare in the azure skye,  
> Mounted in *Phoebus* charet fierie bright,  
> Both darting forth faire beames to each mans eye,  
> And both adorn'd with lampes of flaming light,  
> All that behold so strange prodigious sight,  
> Not knowing natures worke, nor what to weene,  
> Are rapt with wonder, and with rare affright.  
> So stood Sir *Marinell*, when he had seene  
> The semblant of this false by his faire beauties Queene.
>
> All which when *Artegall*, who all this while  
> Stood in the preasse close couered, well aduewed,  
> And saw that boasters pride and gracelesse guile,  
> He could no longer beare, but forth issewed,  
> And vnto all himselfe there open shewed,  
> And to the boaster said; Thou losell base,  
> That hast with borrowed plumes thy selfe endewed,  
> And others worth with leasings doest deface,  
> When they are all restor'd, thou shalt rest in disgrace.
>
> That shield, which thou doest beare, was it indeed,  
> Which this dayes honour sau'd to *Marinell*;  
> But not that arme, nor thou the man I reed,  
> Which didst that seruice vnto *Florimell*.  
> For proofe shew forth thy sword, and let it tell,  
> What strokes, what dreadfull stoure it stird this day:  
> Or shew the wounds, which vnto thee befell;  
> Or shew the sweat, with which thou diddest sway  
> So sharpe a battell, that so many did dismay.
>
> But this the sword, which wrought those cruell stounds,  
> And this the arme, the which that shield did beare,  
> And these the signes, (so shewed forth his wounds)  
> By which that glorie gotten doth appeare.  
> As for this Ladie, which he sheweth here,  
> Is not (I wager) *Florimell* at all;  
> But some fayre Franion, fit for such a fere,  
> That by misfortune in his hand did fall.  
> For proofe whereof, he bad them *Florimell* forth call.
>
> So forth the noble Ladie was ybrought,  
> Adorn'd with honor and all comely grace:  
> Whereto her bashfull shamefastnesse ywrought  
> A great increase in her faire blushing face;  
> As roses did with lillies interlace.  
> For of those words, the which that boaster threw,  
> She inly yet conceiued great disgrace.  
> Whom when as all the people such did vew,  
> They shouted loud, and signes of gladnesse all did shew.
>
> Then did he set her by that snowy one,  
> Like the true saint beside the image set,  
> Of both their beauties to make paragone,  
> And triall, whether should the honor get.  
> Streight way so soone as both together met,  
> Th'enchaunted Damzell vanisht into nought:  
> Her snowy substance melted as with heat,  
> Ne of that goodly hew remayned ought,  
> But th'emptie girdle, which about her wast was wrought.
>
> As when the daughter of *Thaumantes* faire,  
> Hath in a watry cloud displayed wide  
> Her goodly bow, which paints the liquid ayre;  
> That all men wonder at her colours pride;  
> All suddenly, ere one can looke aside,  
> The glorious picture vanisheth away,  
> Ne any token doth thereof abide:  
> So did this Ladies goodly forme decay,  
> And into nothing goe, ere one could it bewray.
>
> Which when as all that present were, beheld,  
> They stricken were with great astonishment,  
> And their faint harts with senselesse horrour queld,  
> To see the thing, that seem'd so excellent,  
> So stolen from their fancies wonderment;  
> That what of it became, none vnderstood.  
> And *Braggadochio* selfe with dreriment  
> So daunted was in his despeyring mood,  
> That like a lifelesse corse immoueable he stood.
>
> But *Artegall* that golden belt vptooke,  
> The which of all her spoyle was onely left;  
> Which was not hers, as many it mistooke,  
> But *Florimells* owne girdle, from her reft,  
> While she was flying, like a weary weft,  
> From that foule monster, which did her compell  
> To perils great; which he vnbuckling eft,  
> Presented to the fayrest *Florimell*;  
> Who round about her tender wast it fitted well.
>
> Full many Ladies often had assayd,  
> About their middles that faire belt to knit;  
> And many a one suppos'd to be a mayd:  
> Yet it to none of all their loynes would fit,  
> Till *Florimell* about her fastned it.  
> Such power it had, that to no womans wast  
> By any skill or labour it would sit,  
> Vnlesse that she were continent and chast,  
> But it would lose or breake, that many had disgrast.
>
> Whilest thus they busied were bout *Florimell*,  
> And boastfull *Braggadochio* to defame,  
> Sir *Guyon* as by fortune then befell,  
> Forth from the thickest preasse of people came,  
> His owne good steed, which he had stolne, to clame;  
> And th'one hand seizing on his golden bit,  
> With th'other drew his sword: for with the same  
> He ment the thiefe there deadly to haue smit:  
> And had he not bene held, he nought had fayld of it.
>
> Thereof great hurly burly moued was  
> Throughout the hall, for that same warlike horse.  
> For *Braggadochio* would not let him pas;  
> And *Guyon* would him algates haue perforse,  
> Or it approue vpon his carrion corse.  
> Which troublous stirre when *Artegall* perceiued,  
> He nigh them drew to stay th'auengers forse,  
> And gan inquire, how was that steed bereaued,  
> Whether by might extort, or else by slight deceaued.
>
> Who all that piteous storie, which befell  
> About that wofull couple, which were slaine,  
> And their young bloodie babe to him gan tell;  
> With whom whiles he did in the wood remaine,  
> His horse purloyned was by subtill traine:  
> For which he chalenged the thiefe to fight.  
> But he for nought could him thereto constraine.  
> For as the death he hated such despight,  
> And rather had to lose, then trie in armes his right.
>
> Which *Artegall* well hearing, though no more  
> By law of armes there neede ones right to trie,  
> As was the wont of warlike knights of yore,  
> Then that his foe should him the field denie,  
> Yet further right by tokens to descrie,  
> He askt, what priuie tokens he did beare.  
> If that (said *Guyon*) may you satisfie,  
> Within his mouth a blacke spot doth appeare,  
> Shapt like a horses shoe, who list to seeke it there.
>
> Whereof to make due tryall, one did take  
> The horse in hand, within his mouth to looke:  
> But with his heeles so sorely he him strake,  
> That all his ribs he quite in peeces broke,  
> That neuer word from that day forth he spoke.  
> Another that would seeme to haue more wit,  
> Him by the bright embrodered hedstall tooke:  
> But by the shoulder him so sore he bit,  
> That he him maymed quite, and all his shoulder split.
>
> Ne he his mouth would open vnto wight,  
> Vntill that *Guyon* selfe vnto him spake,  
> And called *Brigadore* (so was he hight)  
> Whose voice so soone as he did vndertake,  
> Eftsoones he stood as still as any stake,  
> And suffred all his secret marke to see:  
> And when as he him nam'd, for ioy he brake  
> His bands, and follow'd him with gladfull glee,  
> And friskt, and flong aloft, and louted low on knee.
>
> Thereby Sir *Artegall* did plaine areed,  
> That vnto him the horse belong'd, and sayd;  
> Lo there Sir *Guyon*, take to you the steed,  
> As he with golden saddle is arayd;  
> And let that losell, plainely now displayd,  
> Hence fare on foot, till he an horse haue gayned.  
> But the proud boaster gan his doome vpbrayd,  
> And him reuil'd, and rated, and disdayned,  
> That iudgement so vniust against him had ordayned.
>
> Much was the knight incenst with his lewd word,  
> To haue reuenged that his villeny;  
> And thrise did lay his hand vpon his sword,  
> To haue him slaine, or dearely doen aby.  
> But *Guyon* did his choler pacify,  
> Saying, Sir knight, it would dishonour bee  
> To you, that are our iudge of equity,  
> To wreake your wrath on such a carle as hee:  
> It's punishment enough, that all his shame doe see.
>
> So did he mitigate Sir *Artegall*;  
> But *Talus* by the backe the boaster hent,  
> And drawing him out of the open hall,  
> Vpon him did inflict this punishment.  
> First he his beard did shaue, and fowly shent:  
> Then from him reft his shield, and it renuerst,  
> And blotted out his armes with falshood blent,  
> And himselfe baffuld, and his armes vnherst,  
> And broke his sword in twaine, and all his armour sperst.
>
> The whiles his guilefull groome was fled away:  
> But vaine it was to thinke from him to flie.  
> Who ouertaking him did disaray,  
> And all his face deform'd with infamie,  
> And out of court him scourged openly.  
> So ought all faytours, that true knighthood shame,  
> And armes dishonour with base villanie,  
> From all braue knights be banisht with defame:  
> For oft their lewdnes blotteth good deserts with blame.
>
> Now when these counterfeits were thus vncased  
> Out of the foreside of their forgerie,  
> And in the sight of all men cleane disgraced,  
> All gan to iest and gibe full merilie  
> At the remembrance of their knauerie.  
> Ladies can laugh at Ladies, Knights at Knights,  
> To thinke with how great vaunt of brauerie  
> He them abused, through his subtill slights,  
> And what a glorious shew he made in all their sights.
>
> There leaue we them in pleasure and repast,  
> Spending their ioyous dayes and gladfull nights,  
> And taking vsurie of time forepast,  
> With all deare delices and rare delights,  
> Fit for such Ladies and such louely knights:  
> And turne we here to this faire furrowes end  
> Our wearie yokes, to gather fresher sprights,  
> That when as time to *Artegall* shall tend,  
> We on his first aduenture may him forward send.
