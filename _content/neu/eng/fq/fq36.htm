<blockquote>
<i>Paridell rapeth Hellenore:<br>
Malbecco her pursewes:<br>
Findes emongst Satyres, whence with him<br>
To turne she doth refuse.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
T
He morow next, so soone as <i>Phoebus</i> Lamp<br>
Bewrayed had the world with early light,<br>
And fresh <i>Aurora</i> had the shady damp<br>
Out of the goodly heauen amoued quight,<br>
Faire <i>Britomart</i> and that same <i>Faerie</i> knight<br>
Vprose, forth on their iourney for to wend:<br>
But <i>Paridell</i> complaynd, that his late fight<br>
With <i>Britomart</i>, so sore did him offend,<br>
That ryde he could not, till his hurts he did amend.<p>

So forth they far'd, but he behind them stayd,<br>
Maulgre his host, who grudged grieuously,<br>
To house a guest, that would be needes obayd,<br>
And of his owne him left not liberty:<br>
Might wanting measure moueth surquedry.<br>
Two things he feared, but the third was death;<br>
That fierce young mans vnruly maistery;<br>
His money, which he lou'd as liuing breath;<br>
And his faire wife, whom honest long he kept vneath.<p>

But patience perforce he must abie,<br>
What fortune and his fate on him will lay,<br>
Fond is the feare, that findes no remedie;<br>
Yet warily he watcheth euery way,<br>
By which he feareth euill happen may:<br>
So th'euill thinkes by watching to preuent;<br>
Ne doth he suffer her, nor night, nor day,<br>
Out of his sight her selfe once to absent.<br>
So doth he punish her and eke himselfe torment.<p>

But <i>Paridell</i> kept better watch, then hee,<br>
A fit occasion for his turne to find:<br>
False loue, why do men say, thou canst not see,<br>
And in their foolish fancie feigne thee blind,<br>
That with thy charmes the sharpest sight doest bind,<br>
And to thy will abuse?  Thou walkest free,<br>
And seest euery secret of the mind;<br>
Thou seest all, yet none at all sees thee;<br>
All that is by the working of thy Deitee.<p>

So perfect in that art was <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
That he <i>Malbeccoes</i> halfen eye did wyle,<br>
His halfen eye he wiled wondrous well,<br>
And <i>Hellenors</i> both eyes did eke beguyle,<br>
Both eyes and hart attonce, during the whyle<br>
That he there soiourned his wounds to heale;<br>
That <i>Cupid</i> selfe it seeing, close did smyle,<br>
To weet how he her loue away did steale,<br>
And bad, that none their ioyous treason should reueale.<p>

The learned louer lost no time nor tyde,<br>
That least auantage mote to him afford,<br>
Yet bore so faire a saile, that none espyde<br>
His secret drift, till he her layd abord.<br>
When so in open place, and commune bord,<br>
He fortun'd her to meet, with commune speach<br>
He courted her, yet bayted euery word,<br>
That his vngentle hoste n'ote him appeach<br>
Of vile vngentlenesse, or hospitages breach.<p>

But when apart (if euer her apart)<br>
He found, then his false engins fast he plyde,<br>
And all the sleights vnbosomd in his hart;<br>
He sigh'd, he sobd, he swownd, he perdy dyde,<br>
And cast himselfe on ground her fast besyde:<br>
Tho when againe he him bethought to liue,<br>
He wept, and wayld, and false laments belyde,<br>
Saying, but if she Mercie would him giue<br>
That he mote algates dye, yet did his death forgiue.<p>

And otherwhiles with amorous delights,<br>
And pleasing toyes he would her entertaine,<br>
Now singing sweetly, to surprise her sprights,<br>
Now making layes of loue and louers paine,<br>
Bransles, Ballads, virelayes, and verses vaine;<br>
Oft purposes, oft riddles he deuysd,<br>
And thousands like, which flowed in his braine,<br>
With which he fed her fancie, and entysd<br>
To take to his new loue, and leaue her old despysd.<p>

And euery where he might, and euery while<br>
He did her seruice dewtifull, and sewed<br>
At hand with humble pride, and pleasing guile,<br>
So closely yet, that none but she it vewed,<br>
Who well perceiued all, and all indewed.<br>
Thus finely did he his false nets dispred,<br>
With which he many weake harts had subdewed<br>
Of yore, and many had ylike misled:<br>
What wonder then, if she were likewise carried?<p>

No fort so fensible, no wals so strong,<br>
But that continuall battery will riue,<br>
Or daily siege through dispuruayance long,<br>
And lacke of reskewes will to parley driue;<br>
And Peece, that vnto parley eare will giue,<br>
Will shortly yeeld it selfe, and will be made<br>
The vassall of the victors will byliue:<br>
That stratageme had oftentimes assayd<br>
This crafty Paramoure, and now it plaine displayd.<p>

For through his traines he her intrapped hath,<br>
That she her loue and hart hath wholy sold<br>
To him, without regard of gaine, or scath,<br>
Or care of credite, or of husband old,<br>
Whom she hath vow'd to dub a faire Cucquold.<br>
Nought wants but time and place, which shortly shee<br>
Deuized hath, and to her louer told.<br>
It pleased well.  So well they both agree;<br>
So readie rype to ill, ill wemens counsels bee.<p>

Darke was the Euening, fit for louers stealth,<br>
When chaunst <i>Malbecco</i> busie be elsewhere,<br>
She to his closet went, where all his wealth<br>
Lay hid: thereof she countlesse summes did reare,<br>
The which she meant away with her to beare;<br>
The rest she fyr'd for sport, or for despight;<br>
As <i>Hellene</i>, when she saw aloft appeare<br>
The <i>Troiane</i> flames, and reach to heauens hight<br>
Did clap her hands, and ioyed at that dolefull sight.<p>

This second <i>Hellene</i>, faire Dame <i>Hellenore</i>,<br>
The whiles her husband ranne with sory haste,<br>
To quench the flames, which she had tyn'd before,<br>
Laught at his foolish labour spent in waste;<br>
And ranne into her louers armes right fast;<br>
Where streight embraced, she to him did cry,<br>
And call aloud for helpe, ere helpe were past;<br>
For loe that Guest would beare her forcibly,<br>
And meant to rauish her, that rather had to dy.<p>

The wretched man hearing her call for ayd,<br>
And readie seeing him with her to fly,<br>
In his disquiet mind was much dismayd:<br>
But when againe he backward cast his eye,<br>
And saw the wicked fire so furiously<br>
Consume his hart, and scorch his Idoles face,<br>
He was therewith distressed diuersly,<br>
Ne wist he how to turne, nor to what place;<br>
Was neuer wretched man in such a wofull cace.<p>

Ay when to him she cryde, to her he turnd,<br>
And left the fire; loue money ouercame:<br>
But when he marked, how his money burnd,<br>
He left his wife; money did loue disclame:<br>
Both was he loth to loose his loued Dame,<br>
And loth to leaue his liefest pelfe behind,<br>
Yet sith he n'ote saue both, he sau'd that same,<br>
Which was the dearest to his donghill mind,<br>
The God of his desire, the ioy of misers blind.<p>

Thus whilest all things in troublous vprore were,<br>
And all men busie to suppresse the flame,<br>
The louing couple need no reskew feare,<br>
But leasure had, and libertie to frame<br>
Their purpost flight, free from all mens reclame;<br>
And Night, the patronesse of loue-stealth faire,<br>
Gaue them safe conduct, till to end they came:<br>
So bene they gone yfeare, a wanton paire<br>
Of louers loosely knit, where list them to repaire.<p>

Soone as the cruell flames yslaked were,<br>
<i>Malbecco</i> seeing, how his losse did lye,<br>
Out of the flames, which he had quencht whylere<br>
Into huge waues of griefe and gealosye<br>
Full deepe emplonged was, and drowned nye,<br>
Twixt inward doole and felonous despight;<br>
He rau'd, he wept, he stampt, he lowd did cry,<br>
And all the passions, that in man may light,<br>
Did him attonce oppresse, and vex his caytiue spright.<p>

Long thus he chawd the cud of inward griefe,<br>
And did consume his gall with anguish sore,<br>
Still when he mused on his late mischiefe,<br>
Then still the smart thereof increased more,<br>
And seem'd more grieuous, then it was before:<br>
At last when sorrow he saw booted nought,<br>
Ne griefe might not his loue to him restore,<br>
He gan deuise, how her he reskew mought,<br>
Ten thousand wayes he cast in his confused thought.<p>

At last resoluing, like a pilgrim pore,<br>
To sea[r]ch her forth, where so she might be fond,<br>
And bearing with him treasure in close store,<br>
The rest he leaues in ground: so takes in hond<br>
To seeke her endlong, both by sea and lond.<br>
Long he her sought, he sought her farre and nere,<br>
And euery where that he mote vnderstond,<br>
Of knights and ladies any meetings were,<br>
And of eachone he met, he tydings did inquere.<p>

But all in vaine, his woman was too wise,<br>
Euer to come into his clouch againe,<br>
And he too simple euer to surprise<br>
The iolly <i>Paridell</i>, for all his paine.<br>
One day, as he forpassed by the plaine<br>
With weary pace, he farre away espide<br>
A couple, seeming well to be his twaine,<br>
Which houed close vnder a forrest side,<br>
As if they lay in wait, or else themselues did hide.<p>

Well weened he, that those the same mote bee,<br>
And as he better did their shape auize,<br>
Him seemed more their manner did agree;<br>
For th'one was armed all in warlike wize,<br>
Whom, to be <i>Paridell</i> he did deuize;<br>
And th'other all yclad in garments light,<br>
Discolour'd like to womanish disguise,<br>
He did resemble to his Ladie bright;<br>
And euer his faint hart much earned at the sight.<p>

And euer faine he towards them would goe,<br>
But yet durst not for dread approchen nie,<br>
But stood aloofe, vnweeting what to doe;<br>
Till that prickt forth with loues extremitie,<br>
That is the father of fowle gealosy,<br>
He closely nearer crept, the truth to weet:<br>
But, as he nigher drew, he easily<br>
Might scerne, that it was not his sweetest sweet,<br>
Ne yet her Belamour, the partner of his sheet.<p>

But it was scornefull <i>Braggadocchio</i>,<br>
That with his seruant <i>Trompart</i> houerd there,<br>
Sith late he fled from his too earnest foe:<br>
Whom such when as <i>Malbecco</i> spyed clere,<br>
He turned backe, and would haue fled arere;<br>
Till <i>Trompart</i> ronning hastily, him did stay,<br>
And bad before his soueraine Lord appere:<br>
That was him loth, yet durst he not gainesay,<br>
And comming him before, low louted on the lay.<p>

The Boaster at him sternely bent his browe,<br>
As if he could haue kild him with his looke,<br>
That to the ground him meekely made to bowe,<br>
And awfull terror deepe into him strooke,<br>
That euery member of his bodie quooke.<br>
Said he, thou man of nought, what doest thou here,<br>
Vnfitly furnisht with thy bag and booke,<br>
Where I expected one with shield and spere,<br>
To proue some deedes of armes vpon an equall pere.<p>

The wretched man at his imperious speach,<br>
Was all abasht, and low prostrating, said;<br>
Good Sir, let not my rudenesse be no breach<br>
Vnto your patience, ne be ill ypaid;<br>
For I vnwares this way by fortune straid,<br>
A silly Pilgrim driuen to distresse,<br>
That seeke a Lady,---There he suddein staid,<br>
And did the rest with grieuous sighes suppresse,<br>
While teares stood in his eies, few drops of bitternesse.<p>

What Ladie, man? (said <i>Trompart</i>) take good hart,<br>
And tell thy griefe, if any hidden lye;<br>
Was neuer better time to shew thy smart,<br>
Then now, that noble succour is thee by,<br>
That is the whole worlds commune remedy.<br>
That cheareful word his weake hart much did cheare,<br>
And with vaine hope his spirits faint supply,<br>
That bold he said; &ocirc; most redoubted Pere,<br>
Vouchsafe with mild regard a wretches cace to heare.<p>

Then sighing sore, It is not long (said he)<br>
Sith I enioyd the gentlest Dame aliue;<br>
Of whom a knight, no knight at all perdee,<br>
But shame of all, that doe for honor striue,<br>
By treacherous deceipt did me depriue;<br>
Through open outrage he her bore away,<br>
And with fowle force vnto his will did driue,<br>
Which all good knights, that armes do beare this day,<br>
Are bound for to reuenge, and punish if they may.<p>

And you most noble Lord, that can and dare<br>
Redresse the wrong of miserable wight,<br>
Cannot employ your most victorious speare<br>
In better quarrell, then defence of right,<br>
And for a Ladie gainst a faithlesse knight;<br>
So shall your glory be aduaunced much,<br>
And all faire Ladies magnifie your might,<br>
And eke my selfe, albe I simple such,<br>
Your worthy paine shall well reward with guerdon rich.<p>

With that out of his bouget forth he drew<br>
Great store of treasure, therewith him to tempt;<br>
But he on it lookt scornefully askew,<br>
As much disdeigning to be so misdempt,<br>
Or a war-monger to be basely nempt;<br>
And said; Thy offers base I greatly loth,<br>
And eke thy words vncourteous and vnkempt;<br>
I tread in dust thee and thy money both,<br>
That, were it not for shame,---So turned from him wroth.<p>

But <i>Trompart</i>, that his maisters humor knew,<br>
In lofty lookes to hide an humble mind,<br>
Was inly tickled with that golden vew,<br>
And in his eare him rounded close behind:<br>
Yet stoupt he not, but lay still in the wind,<br>
Waiting aduauntage on the pray to sease;<br>
Till <i>Trompart</i> lowly to the ground inclind,<br>
Besought him his great courage to appease,<br>
And pardon simple man, that rash did him displease.<p>

Bigge looking like a doughtie Doucepere,<br>
At last he thus; Thou clod of vilest clay,<br>
I pardon yield, and with thy rudenesse beare;<br>
But weete henceforth, that all that golden pray,<br>
And all that else the vaine world vaunten may,<br>
I loath as doung, ne deeme my dew reward:<br>
Fame is my meed, and glory vertues pray.<br>
But minds of mortall men are muchell mard,<br>
And mou'd amisse with massie mucks vnmeet regard.<p>

And more, I graunt to thy great miserie<br>
Gratious respect, thy wife shall backe be sent,<br>
And that vile knight, who euer that he bee,<br>
Which hath thy Lady reft, and knighthood shent,<br>
By <i>Sanglamort</i> my sword, whose deadly dent<br>
The bloud hath of so many thousands shed,<br>
I sweare, ere long shall dearely it repent;<br>
Ne he twixt heauen and earth shall hide his hed,<br>
But soone he shall be found, and shortly doen be ded.<p>

The foolish man thereat woxe wondrous blith,<br>
As if the word so spoken, were halfe donne,<br>
And humbly thanked him a thousand sith,<br>
That had from death to life him newly wonne.<br>
Tho forth the Boaster marching, braue begonne<br>
His stolen steed to thunder furiously,<br>
As if he heauen and hell would ouerronne,<br>
And all the world confound with cruelty,<br>
That much <i>Malbecco</i> ioyed in his iollity.<p>

Thus long they three together traueiled,<br>
Through many a wood, and many an vncouth way,<br>
To seeke his wife, that was farre wandered:<br>
But those two sought nought, but the present pray,<br>
To weete the treasure, which he did bewray,<br>
On which their eies and harts were wholly set,<br>
With purpose, how they might it best betray;<br>
For sith the houre, that first he did them let<br>
The same behold, therewith their keene desires were whet.<p>

It fortuned as they together far'd,<br>
They spide, where <i>Paridell</i> came pricking fast<br>
Vpon the plaine, the which himselfe prepar'd<br>
To giust with that braue straunger knight a cast,<br>
As on aduenture by the way he past:<br>
Alone he rode without his Paragone;<br>
For hauing filcht her bels, her vp he cast<br>
To the wide world, and let her fly alone,<br>
He nould be clogd.  So had he serued many one.<p>

The gentle Lady, loose at randon left,<br>
The greene-wood long did walke, and wander wide<br>
At wilde aduenture, like a forlorne weft,<br>
Till on a day the <i>Satyres</i> her espide<br>
Straying alone withouten groome or guide;<br>
Her vp they tooke, and with them home her led,<br>
With them as housewife euer to abide,<br>
To milk their gotes, and make them cheese and bred,<br>
And euery one as commune good her handeled.<p>

That shortly she <i>Malbecco</i> has forgot,<br>
And eke Sir <i>Paridell</i>, all were he deare;<br>
Who from her went to seeke another lot,<br>
And now by fortune was arriued here,<br>
Where those two guilers with <i>Malbecco</i> were:<br>
Soone as the old man saw Sir <i>Paridell</i>,<br>
He fainted, and was almost dead with feare,<br>
Ne word he had to speake, his griefe to tell,<br>
But to him louted low, and greeted goodly well.<p>

And after asked him for <i>Hellenore</i>,<br>
I take no keepe of her (said <i>Paridell</i>)<br>
She wonneth in the forrest there before.<br>
So forth he rode, as his aduenture fell;<br>
The whiles the Boaster from his loftie sell<br>
Faynd to alight, something amisse to mend;<br>
But the fresh Swayne would not his leasure dwell,<br>
But went his way; whom when he passed kend,<br>
He vp remounted light, and after faind to wend.<p>

Perdy nay (said <i>Malbecco</i>) shall ye not:<br>
But let him passe as lightly, as he came:<br>
For litle good of him is to be got,<br>
And mickle perill to be put to shame.<br>
But let vs go to seeke my dearest Dame,<br>
Whom he hath left in yonder forrest wyld:<br>
For of her safety in great doubt I am,<br>
Least saluage beastes her person haue despoyld:<br>
Then all the world is lost, and we in vaine haue toyld.<p>

They all agree, and forward them addrest:<br>
Ah but (said craftie <i>Trompart</i>) weete ye well,<br>
That yonder in that wastefull wildernesse<br>
Huge monsters haunt, and many dangers dwell;<br>
Dragons, and Minotaures, and feendes of hell,<br>
And many wilde woodmen, which robbe and rend<br>
All trauellers; therefore aduise ye well,<br>
Before ye enterprise that way to wend:<br>
One may his iourney bring too soone to euill end.<p>

<i>Malbecco</i> stopt in great astonishment,<br>
And with pale eyes fast fixed on the rest,<br>
Their counsell crau'd, in daunger imminent.<br>
Said <i>Trompart</i>, You that are the most opprest<br>
With burden of great treasure, I thinke best<br>
Here for to stay in safetie behind;<br>
My Lord and I will search the wide forrest.<br>
That counsell pleased not <i>Malbeccoes</i> mind;<br>
For he was much affraid, himselfe alone to find.<p>

Then is it best (said he) that ye doe leaue<br>
Your treasure here in some securitie,<br>
Either fast closed in some hollow greaue,<br>
Or buried in the ground from ieopardie,<br>
Till we returne againe in safetie:<br>
As for vs two, least doubt of vs ye haue,<br>
Hence farre away we will blindfolded lie,<br>
Ne priuie be vnto your treasures graue.<br>
It pleased: so he did, Then they march forward braue.<p>

Now when amid the thickest woods they were,<br>
They heard a noyse of many bagpipes shrill,<br>
And shrieking Hububs them approching nere,<br>
Which all the forrest did with horror fill:<br>
That dreadfull sound the boasters hart did thrill,<br>
With such amazement, that in haste he fled,<br>
Ne euer looked backe for good or ill,<br>
And after him eke fearefull <i>Trompart</i> sped;<br>
The old man could not fly, but fell to ground halfe ded.<p>

Yet afterwards close creeping, as he might,<br>
He in a bush did hide his fearefull hed,<br>
The iolly <i>Satyres</i> full of fresh delight,<br>
Came dauncing forth, and with them nimbly led<br>
Faire <i>Hellenore</i>, with girlonds all bespred,<br>
Whom their May-lady they had newly made:<br>
She proud of that new honour, which they red,<br>
And of their louely fellowship full glade,<br>
Daunst liuely, and her face did with a Lawrell shade.<p>

The silly man that in the thicket lay<br>
Saw all this goodly sport, and grieued sore,<br>
Yet durst he not against it doe or say,<br>
But did his hart with bitter thoughts engore,<br>
To see th'vnkindnesse of his <i>Hellenore</i>.<br>
All day they daunced with great lustihed,<br>
And with their horned feet the greene grasse wore,<br>
The whiles their Gotes vpon the brouzes fed,<br>
Till drouping <i>Phoebus</i> gan to hide his golden hed.<p>

Tho vp they gan their merry pypes to trusse,<br>
And all their goodly heards did gather round,<br>
But euery <i>Satyre</i> first did giue a busse<br>
To <i>Hellenore</i>: so busses did abound.<br>
Now gan the humid vapour shed the ground<br>
With perly deaw, and th'Earthes gloomy shade<br>
Did dim the brightnesse of the welkin round,<br>
That euery bird and beast awarned made,<br>
To shrowd themselues, whiles sleepe their senses did inuade.<p>

Which when <i>Malbecco</i> saw, out of his bush<br>
Vpon his hands and feete he crept full light,<br>
And like a Gote emongst the Gotes did rush,<br>
That through the helpe of his faire hornes on hight,<br>
And misty dampe of misconceiuing night,<br>
And eke through likenesse of his gotish beard,<br>
He did the better counterfeite aright:<br>
So home he marcht emongst the horned heard,<br>
That none of all the <i>Satyres</i> him espyde or heard.<p>

At night, when all they went to sleepe, he vewd,<br>
Whereas his louely wife emongst them lay,<br>
Embraced of a <i>Satyre</i> rough and rude,<br>
Who all the night did minde his ioyous play:<br>
Nine times he heard him come aloft ere day,<br>
That all his hart with gealosie did swell;<br>
But yet that nights ensample did bewray,<br>
That not for nought his wife them loued so well,<br>
When one so oft a night did ring his matins bell.<p>

So closely as he could, he to them crept,<br>
When wearie of their sport to sleepe they fell,<br>
And to his wife, that now full soundly slept,<br>
He whispered in her eare, and did her tell,<br>
That it was he, which by her side did dwell,<br>
And therefore prayd her wake, to heare him plaine.<br>
As one out of a dreame not waked well,<br>
She turned her, and returned backe againe:<br>
Yet her for to awake he did the more constraine.<p>

At last with irkesome trouble she abrayd;<br>
And then perceiuing, that it was indeed<br>
Her old <i>Malbecco</i>, which did her vpbrayd,<br>
With loosenesse of her loue, and loathly deed,<br>
She was astonisht with exceeding dreed,<br>
And would haue wakt the <i>Satyre</i> by her syde;<br>
But he her prayd, for mercy, or for meed,<br>
To saue his life, ne let him be descryde,<br>
But hearken to his lore, and all his counsell hyde.<p>

Tho gan he her perswade, to leaue that lewd<br>
And loathsome life, of God and man abhord,<br>
And home returne, where all should be renewd<br>
With perfect peace, and bandes of fresh accord,<br>
And she receiu'd againe to bed and bord,<br>
As if no trespasse euer had bene donne:<br>
But she it all refused at one word,<br>
And by no meanes would to his will be wonne,<br>
But chose emongst the iolly <i>Satyres</i> still to wonne.<p>

He wooed her, till day spring he espyde;<br>
But all in vaine: and then turnd to the heard,<br>
Who butted him with hornes on euery syde,<br>
And trode downe in the durt, where his hore beard<br>
Was fowly dight, and he of death afeard.<br>
Early before the heauens fairest light<br>
Out of the ruddy East was fully reard,<br>
The heardes out of their foldes were loosed quight,<br>
And he emongst the rest crept forth in sory plight.<p>

So soone as he the Prison dore did pas,<br>
He ran as fast, as both his feete could beare,<br>
And neuer looked, who behind him was,<br>
Ne scarsely who before: like as a Beare<br>
That creeping close, amongst the hiues to reare<br>
An hony combe, the wakefull dogs espy,<br>
And him assayling, sore his carkasse teare,<br>
That hardly he with life away does fly,<br>
Ne stayes, till safe himselfe he see from ieopardy.<p>

Ne stayd he, till he came vnto the place,<br>
Where late his treasure he entombed had,<br>
Where when he found it not (for <i>Trompart</i> bace<br>
Had it purloyned for his maister bad:)<br>
With extreme fury he became quite mad,<br>
And ran away, ran with himselfe away:<br>
That who so straungely had him seene bestad,<br>
With vpstart haire, and staring eyes dismay,<br>
From Limbo lake him late escaped sure would say.<p>

High ouer hilles and ouer dales he fled,<br>
As if the wind him on his winges had borne,<br>
Ne banck nor bush could stay him, when he sped<br>
His nimble feet, as treading still on thorne:<br>
Griefe, and despight, and gealosie, and scorne<br>
Did all the way him follow hard behind,<br>
And he himselfe himselfe loath'd so forlorne,<br>
So shamefully forlorne of womankind;<br>
That as a Snake, still lurked in his wounded mind.<p>

Still fled he forward, looking backward still,<br>
Ne stayd his flight, nor fearefull agony,<br>
Till that he came vnto a rockie hill,<br>
Ouer the sea, suspended dreadfully,<br>
That liuing creature it would terrify,<br>
To looke adowne, or vpward to the hight:<br>
From thence he threw himselfe dispiteously,<br>
All desperate of his fore-damned spright,<br>
That seem'd no helpe for him was left in liuing sight.<p>

But through long anguish, and selfe-murdring thought<br>
He was so wasted and forpined quight,<br>
That all his substance was consum'd to nought,<br>
And nothing left, but like an aery Spright,<br>
That on the rockes he fell so flit and light,<br>
That he thereby receiu'd no hurt at all,<br>
But chaunced on a craggy cliff to light;<br>
Whence he with crooked clawes so long did crall,<br>
That at the last he found a caue with entrance small.<p>

Into the same he creepes, and thenceforth there<br>
Resolu'd to build his balefull mansion,<br>
In drery darkenesse, and continuall feare<br>
Of that rockes fall, which euer and anon<br>
Threates with huge ruine him to fall vpon,<br>
That he dare neuer sleepe, but that one eye<br>
Still ope he keepes for that occasion;<br>
Ne euer rests he in tranquillity,<br>
The roring billowes beat his bowre so boystrously.<p>

Ne euer is he wont on ought to feed,<br>
But toades and frogs, his pasture poysonous,<br>
Which in his cold complexion do breed<br>
A filthy bloud, or humour rancorous,<br>
Matter of doubt and dread suspitious,<br>
That doth with curelesse care consume the hart,<br>
Corrupts the stomacke with gall vitious,<br>
Croscuts the liuer with internall smart,<br>
And doth transfixe the soule with deathes eternall dart.<p>

Yet can he neuer dye, but dying liues,<br>
And doth himselfe with sorrow new sustaine,<br>
That death and life attonce vnto him giues.<br>
And painefull pleasure turnes to pleasing paine.<br>
There dwels he euer, miserable swaine,<br>
Hatefull both to him selfe, and euery wight;<br>
Where he through priuy griefe, and horrour vaine,<br>
Is woxen so deform'd, that he has quight<br>
Forgot he was a man, and <i>Gealosie</i> is hight.<p>
