<blockquote>
<i>Guyon encountreth Britomart,<br>
faire Florimell is chaced:<br>
Duessaes traines and Malecastaes<br>
champions are defaced.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
T
He famous Briton Prince and Faerie knight,<br>
After long wayes and perilous paines endured,<br>
Hauing their wearie limbes to perfect plight<br>
Restord, and sory wounds right well recured,<br>
Of the faire <i>Alma</i> greatly were procured,<br>
To make there lenger soiourne and abode;<br>
But when thereto they might not be allured,<br>
From seeking praise, and deeds of armes abrode,<br>
They courteous conge tooke, and forth together yode.<p>

But the captiu'd <i>Acrasia</i> he sent,<br>
Because of trauell long, a nigher way,<br>
With a strong gard, all reskew to preuent,<br>
And her to Faerie court safe to conuay,<br>
That her for witnesse of his hard assay,<br>
Vnto his <i>Faerie</i> Queene he might present:<br>
But he him selfe betooke another way,<br>
To make more triall of his hardiment,<br>
And seeke aduentures, as he with Prince <i>Arthur</i> went.<p>

Long so they trauelled through wastefull wayes,<br>
Where daungers dwelt, and perils most did wonne,<br>
To hunt for glorie and renowmed praise;<br>
Full many Countries they did ouerronne,<br>
From the vprising to the setting Sunne,<br>
And many hard aduentures did atchieue;<br>
Of all the which they honour euer wonne,<br>
Seeking the weake oppressed to relieue,<br>
And to recouer right for such, as wrong did grieue.<p>

At last as through an open plaine they yode,<br>
They spide a knight, that towards pricked faire,<br>
And him beside an aged Squire there rode,<br>
That seem'd to couch vnder his shield three-square,<br>
As if that age bad him that burden spare,<br>
And yield it those, that stouter could it wield:<br>
He them espying, gan himselfe prepare,<br>
And on his arme addresse his goodly shield<br>
That bore a Lion passant in a golden field.<p>

Which seeing good Sir <i>Guyon</i>, deare besought<br>
The Prince of grace, to let him runne that turne.<br>
He graunted: then the Faery quickly raught<br>
His poinant speare, and sharpely gan to spurne<br>
His fomy steed, whose fierie feete did burne<br>
The verdant grasse, as he thereon did tread;<br>
Ne did the other backe his foot returne,<br>
But fiercely forward came withouten dread,<br>
And bent his dreadfull speare against the others head.<p>

They bene ymet, and both their points arriued,<br>
But <i>Guyon</i> droue so furious and fell,<br>
That seem'd both shield &amp; plate it would haue riued;<br>
Nathelesse it bore his foe not from his sell,<br>
But made him stagger, as he were not well:<br>
But <i>Guyon</i> selfe, ere well he was aware,<br>
Nigh a speares length behind his crouper fell,<br>
Yet in his fall so well him selfe he bare,<br>
That mischieuous mischance his life &amp; limbes did spare.<p>

Great shame and sorrow of that fall he tooke;<br>
For neuer yet, sith warlike armes he bore,<br>
And shiuering speare in bloudie field first shooke,<br>
He found himselfe dishonored so sore.<br>
Ah gentlest knight, that euer armour bore,<br>
Let not thee grieue dismounted to haue beene,<br>
And brought to ground, that neuer wast before;<br>
For not thy fault, but secret powre vnseene,<br>
That speare enchaunted was, which layd thee on the greene.<p>

But weenedst thou what wight thee ouerthrew,<br>
Much greater griefe and shamefuller regret<br>
For thy hard fortune then thou wouldst renew,<br>
That of a single damzell thou wert met<br>
On equall plaine, and there so hard beset;<br>
Euen the famous <i>Britomart</i> it was,<br>
Whom straunge aduenture did from <i>Britaine</i> fet,<br>
To seeke her louer (loue farre sought alas,)<br>
Whose image she had seene in <i>Venus</i> looking glas.<p>

Full of disdainefull wrath, he fierce vprose,<br>
For to reuenge that foule reprochfull shame,<br>
And snatching his bright sword began to close<br>
With her on foot, and stoutly forward came;<br>
Die rather would he, then endure that same.<br>
Which when his Palmer saw, he gan to feare<br>
His toward perill and vntoward blame,<br>
Which by that new rencounter he should reare:<br>
For death sate on the point of that enchaunted speare.<p>

And hasting towards him gan faire perswade,<br>
Not to prouoke misfortune, nor to weene<br>
His speares default to mend with cruell blade;<br>
For by his mightie Science he had seene<br>
The secret vertue of that weapon keene,<br>
That mortall puissance mote not withstond:<br>
Nothing on earth mote alwaies happie beene.<br>
Great hazard were it, and aduenture fond,<br>
To loose long gotten honour with one euill hond.<p>

By such good meanes he him discounselled,<br>
From prosecuting his reuenging rage;<br>
And eke the Prince like treaty handeled,<br>
His wrathfull will with reason to asswage,<br>
And laid the blame, not to his carriage,<br>
But to his starting steed, that swaru'd asyde,<br>
And to the ill purueyance of his page,<br>
That had his furnitures not firmely tyde:<br>
So is his angry courage fairely pacifyde.<p>

Thus reconcilement was betweene them knit,<br>
Through goodly temperance, and affection chaste,<br>
And either vowd with all their power and wit,<br>
To let not others honour be defaste,<br>
Of friend or foe, who euer it embaste,<br>
Ne armes to beare against the others syde:<br>
In which accord the Prince was also plaste,<br>
And with that golden chaine of concord tyde.<br>
So goodly all agreed, they forth yfere did ryde.<p>

O goodly vsage of those antique times,<br>
In which the sword was seruant vnto right;<br>
When not for malice and contentious crimes,<br>
But all for praise, and proofe of manly might,<br>
The martiall brood accustomed to fight:<br>
Then honour was the meed of victorie,<br>
And yet the vanquished had no despight:<br>
Let later age that noble vse enuie,<br>
Vile rancour to auoid, and cruell surquedrie.<p>

Long they thus trauelled in friendly wise,<br>
Through countries waste, and eke well edifyde,<br>
Seeking aduentures hard, to exercise<br>
Their puissance, whylome full dernely tryde:<br>
At length they came into a forrest wyde,<br>
Whose hideous horror and sad trembling sound<br>
Full griesly seem'd: therein they long did ryde,<br>
Yet tract of liuing creatures none they found,<br>
Saue Beares, Lions, &amp; Buls, which romed them around.<p>

All suddenly out of the thickest brush,<br>
Vpon a milk-white Palfrey all alone,<br>
A goodly Ladie did foreby them rush,<br>
Whose face did seeme as cleare as Christall stone,<br>
And eke through feare as white as whales bone:<br>
Her garments all were wrought of beaten gold,<br>
And all her steed with tinsell trappings shone,<br>
Which fled so fast, that nothing mote him hold,<br>
And scarse them leasure gaue, her passing to behold.<p>

Still as she fled, her eye she backward threw,<br>
As fearing euill, that pursewd her fast;<br>
And her faire yellow locks behind her flew,<br>
Loosely disperst with puffe of euery blast:<br>
All as a blazing starre doth farre outcast<br>
His hearie beames, and flaming lockes dispred,<br>
At sight whereof the people stand aghast:<br>
But the sage wisard telles, as he has red,<br>
That it importunes death and dolefull drerihed.<p>

So as they gazed after her a while,<br>
Lo where a griesly Foster forth did rush,<br>
Breathing out beastly lust her to defile:<br>
His tyreling iade he fiercely forth did push,<br>
Through thicke and thin, both ouer banke and bush<br>
In hope her to attaine by hooke or crooke,<br>
That from his gorie sides the bloud did gush:<br>
Large were his limbes, and terrible his looke,<br>
And in his clownish hand a sharp bore speare he shooke.<p>

Which outrage when those gentle knights did see,<br>
Full of great enuie and fell gealosy,<br>
They stayd not to auise, who first should bee,<br>
But all spurd after fast, as they mote fly,<br>
To reskew her from shamefull villany.<br>
The Prince and <i>Guyon</i> equally byliue<br>
Her selfe pursewd, in hope to win thereby<br>
Most goodly meede, the fairest Dame aliue:<br>
But after the foule foster <i>Timias</i> did striue.<p>

The whiles faire <i>Britomart</i>, whose constant mind,<br>
Would not so lightly follow beauties chace,<br>
Ne reckt of Ladies Loue, did stay behind,<br>
And them awayted there a certaine space,<br>
To weet if they would turne backe to that place:<br>
But when she saw them gone, she forward went,<br>
As lay her iourney, through that perlous Pace,<br>
With stedfast courage and stout hardiment;<br>
Ne euill thing she fear'd, ne euill thing she ment.<p>

At last as nigh out of the wood she came,<br>
A stately Castle farre away she spyde,<br>
To which her steps directly she did frame.<br>
That Castle was most goodly edifyde,<br>
And plaste for pleasure nigh that forrest syde:<br>
But faire before the gate a spatious plaine,<br>
Mantled with greene, it selfe did spredden wyde,<br>
On which she saw sixe knights, that did darraine<br>
Fierce battell against one, with cruell might and maine.<p>

Mainly they all attonce vpon him laid,<br>
And sore beset on euery side around,<br>
That nigh he breathlesse grew, yet nought dismaid,<br>
Ne euer to them yielded foot of ground<br>
All had he lost much bloud through many a wound,<br>
But stoutly dealt his blowes, and euery way<br>
To which he turned in his wrathfull stound,<br>
Made them recoile, and fly from dred decay,<br>
That none of all the sixe before, him durst assay.<p>

Like dastard Curres, that hauing at a bay<br>
The saluage beast embost in wearie chace,<br>
Dare not aduenture on the stubborne pray,<br>
Ne byte before, but rome from place to place,<br>
To get a snatch, when turned is his face.<br>
In such distresse and doubtfull ieopardy,<br>
When <i>Britomart</i> him saw, she ran a pace<br>
Vnto his reskew, and with earnest cry,<br>
Bad those same sixe forbeare that single enimy.<p>

But to her cry they list not lenden eare,<br>
Ne ought the more their mightie strokes surceasse,<br>
But gathering him round about more neare,<br>
Their direfull rancour rather did encreasse;<br>
Till that she rushing through the thickest preasse,<br>
Perforce disparted their compacted gyre,<br>
And soone compeld to hearken vnto peace:<br>
Tho gan she myldly of them to inquyre<br>
The cause of their dissention and outrageous yre.<p>

Whereto that single knight did answere frame;<br>
These sixe would me enforce by oddes of might,<br>
To chaunge my liefe, and loue another Dame,<br>
That death me liefer were, then such despight,<br>
So vnto wrong to yield my wrested right:<br>
For I loue one, the truest one on ground,<br>
Ne list me chaunge; she th'<i>Errant Damzell</i> hight,<br>
For whose deare sake full many a bitter stownd,<br>
I haue endur'd, and tasted many a bloudy wound.<p>

Certes (said she) then bene ye sixe to blame,<br>
To weene your wrong by force to iustifie:<br>
For knight to leaue his Ladie were great shame,<br>
That faithfull is, and better were to die.<br>
All losse is lesse, and lesse the infamie,<br>
Then losse of loue to him, that loues but one;<br>
Ne may loue be compeld by maisterie;<br>
For soone as maisterie comes, sweet loue anone<br>
Taketh his nimble wings, and soone away is gone.<p>

Then spake one of those sixe, There dwelleth here<br>
Within this castle wall a Ladie faire,<br>
Whose soueraine beautie hath no liuing pere,<br>
Thereto so bounteous and so debonaire,<br>
That neuer any mote with her compaire.<br>
She hath ordaind this law, which we approue,<br>
That euery knight, which doth this way repaire,<br>
In case he haue no Ladie, nor no loue,<br>
Shall doe vnto her seruice neuer to remoue.<p>

But if he haue a Ladie or a Loue,<br>
Then must he her forgoe with foule defame,<br>
Or else with vs by dint of sword approue,<br>
That she is fairer, then our fairest Dame,<br>
As did this knight, before ye hither came.<br>
Perdie (said <i>Britomart</i>) the choise is hard:<br>
But what reward had he, that ouercame?<br>
He should aduaunced be to high regard,<br>
(Said they) and haue our Ladies loue for his reward.<p>

Therefore a read Sir, if thou haue a loue.<br>
Loue haue I sure, (quoth she) but Lady none;<br>
Yet will I not fro mine owne loue remoue,<br>
Ne to your Lady will I seruice done,<br>
But wreake your wrongs wrought to this knight alone,<br>
And proue his cause.  With that her mortall speare<br>
She mightily auentred towards one,<br>
And downe him smot, ere well aware he weare,<br>
Then to the next she rode, &amp; downe the next did beare.<p>

Ne did she stay, till three on ground she layd,<br>
That none of them himselfe could reare againe;<br>
The fourth was by that other knight dismayd,<br>
All were he wearie of his former paine,<br>
That now there do but two of six remaine;<br>
Which two did yield, before she did them smight.<br>
Ah (said she then) now may ye all see plaine,<br>
That truth is strong, and trew loue most of might,<br>
That for his trusty seruaunts doth so strongly fight.<p>

Too well we see, (said they) and proue too well<br>
Our faulty weaknesse, and your matchlesse might:<br>
For thy, faire Sir, yours be the Damozell,<br>
Which by her owne law to your lot doth light,<br>
And we your liege men faith vnto you plight.<br>
So vnderneath her feet their swords they mard,<br>
And after her besought, well as they might,<br>
To enter in, and reape the dew reward:<br>
She graunted, and then in they all together far'd.<p>

Long were it to describe the goodly frame,<br>
And stately port of <i>Castle Ioyeous</i>,<br>
(For so that Castle hight by commune name)<br>
Where they were entertaind with curteous<br>
And comely glee of many gracious<br>
Faire Ladies, and of many a gentle knight,<br>
Who through a Chamber long and spacious,<br>
Eftsoones them brought vnto their Ladies sight,<br>
That of them cleeped was the <i>Lady of delight</i>.<p>

But for to tell the sumptuous aray<br>
Of that great chamber, should be labour lost:<br>
For liuing wit, I weene, cannot display<br>
The royall riches and exceeding cost,<br>
Of euery pillour and of euery post;<br>
Which all of purest bullion framed were,<br>
And with great pearles and pretious stones embost,<br>
That the bright glister of their beames cleare<br>
Did sparckle forth great light, and glorious did appeare.<p>

These straunger knights through passing, forth were led<br>
Into an inner rowme, whose royaltee<br>
And rich purueyance might vneath be red;<br>
Mote Princes place beseeme so deckt to bee.<br>
Which stately manner when as they did see,<br>
The image of superfluous riotize,<br>
Exceeding much the state of meane degree,<br>
They greatly wondred, whence so sumptuous guize<br>
Might be maintaynd, and each gan diuersely deuize.<p>

The wals were round about apparelled<br>
With costly clothes of <i>Arras</i> and of <i>Toure</i>,<br>
In which with cunning hand was pourtrahed<br>
The loue of <i>Venus</i> and her Paramoure<br>
The faire <i>Adonis</i>, turned to a flowre,<br>
A worke of rare deuice, and wondrous wit.<br>
First did it shew the bitter balefull stowre,<br>
Which her assayd with many a feruent fit,<br>
When first her tender hart was with his beautie smit.<p>

Then with what sleights and sweet allurements she<br>
Entyst the Boy, as well that art she knew,<br>
And wooed him her Paramoure to be;<br>
Now making girlonds of each flowre that grew,<br>
To crowne his golden lockes with honour dew;<br>
Now leading him into a secret shade<br>
From his Beauperes, and from bright heauens vew,<br>
Where him to sleepe she gently would perswade,<br>
Or bathe him in a fountaine by some couert glade.<p>

And whilst he slept, she ouer him would spred<br>
Her mantle, colour'd like the starry skyes,<br>
And her soft arme lay vnderneath his hed,<br>
And with ambrosiall kisses bathe his eyes;<br>
And whilest he bath'd, with her two crafty spyes,<br>
She secretly would search each daintie lim,<br>
And throw into the well sweet Rosemaryes,<br>
And fragrant violets, and Pances trim,<br>
And euer with sweet Nectar she did sprinkle him.<p>

So did she steale his heedelesse hart away,<br>
And ioyd his loue in secret vnespyde.<br>
But for she saw him bent to cruell play,<br>
To hunt the saluage beast in forrest wyde,<br>
Dreadfull of daunger, that mote him betyde,<br>
She oft and oft aduiz'd him to refraine<br>
From chase of greater beasts, whose brutish pryde<br>
Mote breede him scath vnwares: but all in vaine;<br>
For who can shun the chaunce, that dest'ny doth ordaine?<p>

Lo, where beyond he lyeth languishing,<br>
Deadly engored of a great wild Bore,<br>
And by his side the Goddesse groueling<br>
Makes for him endlesse mone, and euermore<br>
With her soft garment wipes away the gore,<br>
Which staines his snowy skin with hatefull hew:<br>
But when she saw no helpe might him restore,<br>
Him to a dainty flowre she did transmew,<br>
Which in that cloth was wrought, as if it liuely grew.<p>

So was that chamber clad in goodly wize,<br>
And round about it many beds were dight,<br>
As whilome was the antique worldes guize,<br>
Some for vntimely ease, some for delight,<br>
As pleased them to vse, that vse it might:<br>
And all was full of Damzels, and of Squires,<br>
Dauncing and reueling both day and night,<br>
And swimming deepe in sensuall desires,<br>
And <i>Cupid</i> still emongst them kindled lustfull fires.<p>

And all the while sweet Musicke did diuide<br>
Her looser notes with <i>Lydian</i> harmony;<br>
And all the while sweet birdes thereto applide<br>
Their daintie layes and dulcet melody,<br>
Ay caroling of loue and iollity,<br>
That wonder was to heare their trim consort.<br>
Which when those knights beheld, with scornefull eye,<br>
They sdeigned such lasciuious disport,<br>
And loath'd the loose demeanure of that wanton sort.<p>

Thence they were brought to that great Ladies vew,<br>
Whom they found sitting on a sumptuous bed,<br>
That glistred all with gold and glorious shew,<br>
As the proud <i>Persian</i> Queenes accustomed:<br>
She seemd a woman of great bountihed,<br>
And of rare beautie, sauing that askaunce<br>
Her wanton eyes, ill signes of womanhed,<br>
Did roll too highly, and too often glaunce,<br>
Without regard of grace, or comely amenaunce.<p>

Long worke it were, and needlesse to deuize<br>
Their goodly entertainement and great glee:<br>
She caused them be led in curteous wize<br>
Into a bowre, disarmed for to bee,<br>
And cheared well with wine and spiceree:<br>
The <i>Redcrosse</i> Knight was soone disarmed there,<br>
But the braue Mayd would not disarmed bee,<br>
But onely vented vp her vmbriere,<br>
And so did let her goodly visage to appere.<p>

As when faire <i>Cynthia</i>, in darkesome night,<br>
Is in a noyous cloud enueloped,<br>
Where she may find the substaunce thin and light,<br>
Breakes forth her siluer beames, and her bright hed<br>
Discouers to the world discomfited;<br>
Of the poore traueller, that went astray,<br>
With thousand blessings she is heried;<br>
Such was the beautie and the shining ray,<br>
With which faire <i>Britomart</i> gaue light vnto the day.<p>

And eke those six, which lately with her fought,<br>
Now were disarmd, and did them selues present<br>
Vnto her vew, and company vnsoght;<br>
For they all seemed curteous and gent,<br>
And all sixe brethren, borne of one parent,<br>
Which had them traynd in all ciuilitee,<br>
And goodly taught to tilt and turnament;<br>
Now were they liegemen to this Lady free,<br>
And her knights seruice ought, to hold of her in fee.<p>

The first of them by name <i>Gardante</i> hight,<br>
A iolly person, and of comely vew;<br>
The second was <i>Parlante</i>, a bold knight,<br>
And next to him <i>Iocante</i> did ensew;<br>
<i>Basciante</i> did him selfe most curteous shew;<br>
But fierce <i>Bacchante</i> seemd too fell and keene;<br>
And yet in armes <i>Noctante</i> greater grew:<br>
All were faire knights, and goodly well beseene,<br>
But to faire <i>Britomart</i> they all but shadowes beene.<p>

For she was full of amiable grace,<br>
And manly terrour mixed therewithall,<br>
That as the one stird vp affections bace,<br>
So th'other did mens rash desires apall,<br>
And hold them backe, that would in errour fall;<br>
As he, that hath espide a vermeill Rose,<br>
To which sharpe thornes and breres the way forstall,<br>
Dare not for dread his hardy hand expose,<br>
But wishing it far off, his idle wish doth lose.<p>

Whom when the Lady saw so faire a wight.<br>
All ignoraunt of her contrary sex,<br>
(For she her weend a fresh and lusty knight)<br>
She greatly gan enamoured to wex,<br>
And with vaine thoughts her falsed fancy vex:<br>
Her fickle hart conceiued hasty fire,<br>
Like sparkes of fire, which fall in sclender flex,<br>
That shortly brent into extreme desire,<br>
And ransackt all her veines with passion entire.<p>

Eftsoones she grew to great impatience<br>
And into termes of open outrage brust,<br>
That plaine discouered her incontinence,<br>
Ne reckt she, who her meaning did mistrust;<br>
For she was giuen all to fleshly lust,<br>
And poured forth in sensuall delight,<br>
That all regard of shame she had discust,<br>
And meet respect of honour put to flight:<br>
So shamelesse beauty soone becomes a loathy sight.<p>

Faire Ladies, that to loue captiued arre,<br>
And chaste desires do nourish in your mind,<br>
Let not her fault your sweet affections marre,<br>
Ne blot the bounty of all womankind;<br>
'Mongst thousands good one wanton Dame to find:<br>
Emongst the Roses grow some wicked weeds;<br>
For this was not to loue, but lust inclind;<br>
For loue does alwayes bring forth bounteous deeds,<br>
And in each gentle hart desire of honour breeds.<p>

Nought so of loue this looser Dame did skill,<br>
But as a coale to kindle fleshly flame,<br>
Giuing the bridle to her wanton will,<br>
And treading vnder foote her honest name:<br>
Such loue is hate, and such desire is shame.<br>
Still did she roue at her with crafty glaunce<br>
Of her false eyes, that at her hart did ayme,<br>
And told her meaning in her countenaunce;<br>
But <i>Britomart</i> dissembled it with ignoraunce.<p>

Supper was shortly dight and downe they sat,<br>
Where they were serued with all sumptuous fare,<br>
Whiles fruitfull <i>Ceres</i>, and <i>Ly&aelig;us</i> fat<br>
Pourd out their plenty, without spight or spare:<br>
Nought wanted there, that dainty was and rare;<br>
And aye the cups their bancks did ouerflow,<br>
And aye betweene the cups, she did prepare<br>
Way to her loue, and secret darts did throw;<br>
But <i>Britomart</i> would not such guilfull message know.<p>

So when they slaked had the feruent heat<br>
Of appetite with meates of euery sort,<br>
The Lady did faire <i>Britomart</i> entreat,<br>
Her to disarme, and with delightfull sport<br>
To loose her warlike limbs and strong effort,<br>
But when she mote not thereunto be wonne,<br>
(For she her sexe vnder that straunge purport<br>
Did vse to hide, and plaine apparaunce shonne:)<br>
In plainer wise to tell her grieuaunce she begonne.<p>

And all attonce discouered her desire<br>
With sighes, and sobs, and plaints, &amp; piteous griefe,<br>
The outward sparkes of her in burning fire;<br>
Which spent in vaine, at last she told her briefe,<br>
That but if she did lend her short reliefe,<br>
And do her comfort, she mote algates dye.<br>
But the chaste damzell, that had neuer priefe<br>
Of such malengine and fine forgerie,<br>
Did easily beleeue her strong extremitie.<p>

Full easie was for her to haue beliefe,<br>
Who by self-feeling of her feeble sexe,<br>
And by long triall of the inward griefe,<br>
Wherewith imperious loue her hart did vexe,<br>
Could iudge what paines do louing harts perplexe.<br>
Who meanes no guile, be guiled soonest shall,<br>
And to faire semblaunce doth light faith annexe;<br>
The bird, that knowes not the false fowlers call,<br>
Into his hidden net full easily doth fall.<p>

For thy, she would not in discourteise wise,<br>
Scorne the faire offer of good will profest;<br>
For great rebuke it is, loue to despise,<br>
Or rudely sdeigne a gentle harts request;<br>
But with faire countenaunce, as beseemed best,<br>
Her entertaynd; nath'lesse she inly deemd<br>
Her loue too light, to wooe a wandring guest:<br>
Which she misconstruing, thereby esteemd<br>
That from like inward fire that outward smoke had steemd.<p>

Therewith a while she her flit fancy fed,<br>
Till she mote winne fit time for her desire,<br>
But yet her wound still inward freshly bled,<br>
And through her bones the false instilled fire<br>
Did spred it selfe, and venime close inspire.<br>
Tho were the tables taken all away,<br>
And euery knight, and euery gentle Squire<br>
Gan choose his dame with <i>Basciomani</i> gay,<br>
With whom he meant to make his sport &amp; courtly play.<p>

Some fell to daunce, some fell to hazardry,<br>
Some to make loue, some to make meriment,<br>
As diuerse wits to diuers things apply;<br>
And all the while faire <i>Malecasta</i> bent<br>
Her crafty engins to her close intent.<br>
By this th'eternall lampes, wherewith high <i>Ioue</i><br>
Doth light the lower world, were halfe yspent,<br>
And the moist daughters of huge <i>Atlas</i> stroue<br>
Into the <i>Ocean</i> deepe to driue their weary droue.<p>

High time it seemed then for euery wight<br>
Them to betake vnto their kindly rest;<br>
Eftsoones long waxen torches weren light,<br>
Vnto their bowres to guiden euery guest:<br>
Tho when the Britonesse saw all the rest<br>
Auoided quite, she gan her selfe despoile,<br>
And safe commit to her soft fethered nest,<br>
Where through long watch, &amp; late dayes weary toile,<br>
She soundly slept, &amp; carefull thoughts did quite assoile.<p>

Now whenas all the world in silence deepe<br>
Yshrowded was, and euery mortall wight<br>
Was drowned in the depth of deadly sleepe,<br>
Faire <i>Malecasta</i>, whose engrieued spright<br>
Could find no rest in such perplexed plight,<br>
Lightly arose out of her wearie bed,<br>
And vnder the blacke vele of guilty Night,<br>
Her with a scarlot mantle couered,<br>
That was with gold and Ermines faire enueloped.<p>

Then panting soft, and trembling euerie ioynt,<br>
Her fearfull feete towards the bowre she moued;<br>
Where she for secret purpose did appoynt<br>
To lodge the warlike mayd vnwisely loued,<br>
And to her bed approching, first she prooued,<br>
Whether she slept or wakt, with her soft hand<br>
She softly felt, if any member mooued,<br>
And lent her wary eare to vnderstand,<br>
If any puffe of breath, or signe of sence she fand.<p>

Which whenas none she fond, with easie shift,<br>
For feare least her vnwares she should abrayd,<br>
Th'embroderd quilt she lightly vp did lift,<br>
And by her side her selfe she softly layd,<br>
Of euery finest fingers touch affrayd;<br>
Ne any noise she made, ne word she spake,<br>
But inly sigh'd.  At last the royall Mayd<br>
Out of her quiet slomber did awake,<br>
And chaungd her weary side, the better ease to take.<p>

Where feeling one close couched by her side,<br>
She lightly lept out of her filed bed,<br>
And to her weapon ran, in minde to gride<br>
The loathed leachour.  But the Dame halfe ded<br>
Through suddein feare and ghastly drerihed,<br>
Did shrieke alowd, that through the house it rong,<br>
And the whole family therewith adred,<br>
Rashly out of their rouzed couches sprong,<br>
And to the troubled chamber all in armes did throng.<p>

And those six Knights that Ladies Champions,<br>
And eke the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight ran to the stownd,<br>
Halfe armd and halfe vnarmd, with them attons:<br>
Where when confusedly they came, they fownd<br>
Their Lady lying on the sencelesse grownd;<br>
On th'other side, they saw the warlike Mayd<br>
All in her snow-white smocke, with locks vnbownd,<br>
Threatning the point of her auenging blade,<br>
That with so troublous terrour they were all dismayde.<p>

About their Lady first they flockt arownd,<br>
Whom hauing laid in comfortable couch,<br>
Shortly they reard out of her frosen swownd;<br>
And afterwards they gan with fowle reproch<br>
To stirre vp strife, and troublous contecke broch:<br>
But by ensample of the last dayes losse,<br>
None of them rashly durst to her approch,<br>
Ne in so glorious spoile themselues embosse;<br>
Her succourd eke the Champion of the bloudy Crosse.<p>

But one of those sixe knights, <i>Gardante</i> hight,<br>
Drew out a deadly bow and arrow keene,<br>
Which forth he sent with felonous despight,<br>
And fell intent against the virgin sheene:<br>
The mortall steele stayd not, till it was seene<br>
To gore her side, yet was the wound not deepe,<br>
But lightly rased her soft silken skin,<br>
That drops of purple bloud thereout did weepe,<br>
Which did her lilly smock with staines of vermeil steepe.<p>

Wherewith enrag'd she fiercely at them flew,<br>
And with her flaming sword about her layd,<br>
That none of them foule mischiefe could eschew,<br>
But with her dreadfull strokes were all dismayd:<br>
Here, there, and euery where about her swayd<br>
Her wrathfull steele, that none mote it abide;<br>
And eke the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight gaue her good aid,<br>
Ay ioyning foot to foot, and side to side,<br>
That in short space their foes they haue quite terrifide.<p>

Tho whenas all were put to shamefull flight,<br>
The noble <i>Britomartis</i> her arayd,<br>
And her bright armes about her body dight:<br>
For nothing would she lenger there be stayd,<br>
Where so loose life, and so vngentle trade<br>
Was vsd of Knights and Ladies seeming gent:<br>
So earely ere the grosse Earthes gryesy shade<br>
Was all disperst out of the firmament,<br>
They tooke their steeds, &amp; forth vp&otilde; their iourney went.<p>
