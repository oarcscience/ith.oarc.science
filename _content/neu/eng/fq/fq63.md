*Cant. XI.*

> *Prince Arthure ouercomes the great  
> Gerioneo in fight:  
> Doth slay the Monster, and restore  
> Belge vnto her right.*

> I T often fals in course of common life,  
> That right long time is ouerborne of wrong,  
> Through auarice, or powre, or guile, or strife,  
> That weakens her, and makes her party strong:  
> But Iustice, though her dome she doe prolong,  
> Yet at the last she will her owne cause right.  
> As by sad *Belge* seemes, whose wrongs though long  
> She suffred, yet at length she did requight,  
> And sent redresse thereof by this braue Briton Knight.
>
> Whereof when newes was to that Tyrant brought,  
> How that the Lady *Belge* now had found  
> A Champion, that had with his Champion fought,  
> And laid his Seneschall low on the ground,  
> And eke him selfe did threaten to confound,  
> He gan to burne in rage, and friese in feare,  
> Doubting sad end of principle vnsound:  
> Yet sith he heard but one, that did appeare,  
> He did him selfe encourage, and take better cheare.
>
> Nathelesse him selfe he armed all in hast,  
> And forth he far'd with all his many bad,  
> Ne stayed step, till that he came at last  
> Vnto the Castle, which they conquerd had.  
> There with huge terrour, to be more ydrad,  
> He sternely marcht before the Castle gate,  
> And with bold vaunts, and ydle threatning bad  
> Deliuer him his owne, ere yet too late,  
> To which they had no right, nor any wrongfull state.
>
> The Prince staid not his aunswere to deuize,  
> But opening streight the Sparre, forth to him came,  
> Full nobly mounted in right warlike wize;  
> And asked him, if that he were the same,  
> Who all that wrong vnto that wofull Dame  
> So long had done, and from her natiue land  
> Exiled her, that all the world spake shame.  
> He boldly aunswerd him, he there did stand  
> That would his doings iustifie with his owne hand.
>
> With that so furiously at him he flew,  
> As if he would haue ouerrun him streight,  
> And with his huge great yron axe gan hew  
> So hideously vppon his armour bright,  
> As he to peeces would haue chopt it quight:  
> That the bold Prince was forced foote to giue  
> To his first rage, and yeeld to his despight;  
> The whilest at him so dreadfully he driue,  
> That seem'd a marble rocke asunder could haue riue.
>
> Thereto a great aduauntage eke he has  
> Through his three double hands thrise multiplyde,  
> Besides the double strength, which in them was:  
> For stil when fit occasion did betyde,  
> He could his weapon shift from side to syde,  
> From hand to hand, and with such nimblesse sly  
> Could wield about, that ere it were espide,  
> The wicked stroke did wound his enemy,  
> Behinde, beside, before, as he it list apply.
>
> Which vncouth vse when as the Prince perceiued,  
> He gan to watch the wielding of his hand,  
> Least by such slight he were vnwares deceiued;  
> And euer ere he saw the stroke to land,  
> He would it meete, and warily withstand.  
> One time, when he his weapon faynd to shift,  
> As he was wont, and chang'd from hand to hand,  
> He met him with a counterstroke so swift,  
> That quite smit off his arme, as he it vp did lift.
>
> Therewith, all fraught with fury and disdaine,  
> He brayd aloud for very fell despight;  
> And sodainely t'auenge him selfe againe,  
> Gan into one assemble all the might  
> Of all his hands, and heaued them on hight,  
> Thinking to pay him with that one for all:  
> But the sad steele seizd not, where it was hight,  
> Vppon the childe, but somewhat short did fall,  
> And lighting on his horses head, him quite did mall.
>
> Downe streight to ground fell his astonisht steed,  
> And eke to th'earth his burden with him bare:  
> But he him selfe full lightly from him freed,  
> And gan him selfe to fight on foote prepare.  
> Whereof when as the Gyant was aware,  
> He wox right blyth, as he had got thereby,  
> And laught so loud, that all his teeth wide bare  
> One might haue seene enraung'd disorderly,  
> Like to a rancke of piles, that pitched are awry.
>
> Eftsoones againe his axe he raught on hie,  
> Ere he were throughly buckled to his geare;  
> And can let driue at him so dreadfullie,  
> That had he chaunced not his shield to reare,  
> Ere that huge stroke arriued on him neare,  
> He had him surely clouen quite in twaine.  
> But th'Adamantine shield, which he did beare,  
> So well was tempred, that for all his maine,  
> It would no passage yeeld vnto his purpose vaine.
>
> Yet was the stroke so forcibly applide,  
> That made him stagger with vncertaine sway,  
> As if he would haue tottered to one side.  
> Wherewith full wroth, he fiercely gan assay,  
> That curt'sie with like kindnesse to repay;  
> And smote at him with so importune might,  
> That two more of his armes did fall away,  
> Like fruitlesse braunches, which the hatchets slight  
> Hath pruned from the natiue tree, and cropped quight.
>
> With that all mad and furious he grew,  
> Like a fell mastiffe through enraging heat,  
> And curst, and band, and blasphemies forth threw,  
> Against his Gods, and fire to them did threat,  
> And hell vnto him selfe with horrour great.  
> Thenceforth he car'd no more, which way he strooke,  
> Nor where it light, but gan to chaufe and sweat,  
> And gnasht his teeth, and his head at him shooke,  
> And sternely him beheld with grim and ghastly looke.
>
> Nought fear'd the childe his lookes, ne yet his threats,  
> But onely wexed now the more aware,  
> To saue him selfe from those his furious heats,  
> And watch aduauntage, how to worke his care:  
> The which good Fortune to him offred faire.  
> For as he in his rage him ouerstrooke,  
> He ere he could his weapon backe repaire,  
> His side all bare and naked ouertooke,  
> And with his mortal steel quite throgh the body strooke.
>
> Through all three bodies he him strooke attonce;  
> That all the three attonce fell on the plaine:  
> Else should he thrise haue needed, for the nonce  
> Them to haue stricken, and thrise to haue slaine.  
> So now all three one sencelesse lumpe remaine,  
> Enwallow'd in his owne blacke bloudy gore,  
> And byting th'earth for very deaths disdaine;  
> Who with a cloud of night him couering, bore  
> Downe to the house of dole, his daies there to deplore.
>
> Which when the Lady from the Castle saw,  
> Where she with her two sonnes did looking stand,  
> She towards him in hast her selfe did draw,  
> To greet him the good fortune of his hand:  
> And all the people both of towne and land,  
> Which there stood gazing from the Citties wall  
> Vppon these warriours, greedy t'vnderstand,  
> To whether should the victory befall,  
> Now when they saw it falne, they eke him greeted all.
>
> But *Belge* with her sonnes prostrated low  
> Before his feete, in all that peoples sight;  
> Mongst ioyes mixing some tears, mongst wele, some wo,  
> Him thus bespake; O most redoubted Knight  
> The which hast me, of all most wretched wight,  
> That earst was dead, restor'd to life againe,  
> And these weake impes replanted by thy might;  
> What guerdon can I giue thee for thy paine,  
> But euen that which thou sauedst, thine still to remaine?
>
> He tooke her vp forby the lilly hand,  
> And her recomforted the best he might,  
> Saying; Deare Lady, deedes ought not be scand  
> By th'authors manhood, nor the doers might,  
> But by their trueth and by the causes right:  
> That same is it, which fought for you this day.  
> What other meed then need me to requight,  
> But that which yeeldeth vertues meed alway?  
> That is the vertue selfe, which her reward doth pay.
>
> She humbly thankt him for that wondrous grace,  
> And further sayd; Ah Sir, but mote ye please,  
> Sith ye thus farre haue tendred my poore case,  
> As from my chiefest foe me to release,  
> That your victorious arme will not yet cease,  
> Till ye haue rooted all the relickes out  
> Of that vilde race, and stablished my peace.  
> What is there else (sayd he) left of their rout?  
> Declare it boldly Dame, and doe not stand in dout.
>
> Then wote you, Sir, that in this Church hereby,  
> There stands an Idole of great note and name,  
> The which this Gyant reared first on hie,  
> And of his owne vaine fancies thought did frame:  
> To whom for endlesse horrour of his shame,  
> He offred vp for daily sacrifize  
> My children and my people, burnt in flame;  
> With all the tortures, that he could deuize,  
> The more t'aggrate his God with such his blouddy guize.
>
> And vnderneath this Idoll there doth lie  
> An hideous monster, that doth it defend,  
> And feedes on all the carkasses, that die  
> In sacrifize vnto that cursed feend:  
> Whose vgly shape none euer saw, nor kend,  
> That euer scap'd: for of a man they say  
> It has the voice, that speaches forth doth send,  
> Euen blasphemous words, which she doth bray  
> Out of her poysnous entrails, fraught with dire decay.
>
> Which when the Prince heard tell, his heart gan earne  
> For great desire, that Monster to assay,  
> And prayd the place of her abode to learne.  
> Which being shew'd, he gan him selfe streight way  
> Thereto addresse, and his bright shield display.  
> So to the Church he came, where it was told,  
> The Monster vnderneath the Altar lay;  
> There he that Idoll saw of massy gold  
> Most richly made, but there no Monster did behold.
>
> Vpon the Image with his naked blade  
> Three times, as in defiance, there he strooke;  
> And the third time out of an hidden shade,  
> There forth issewd, from vnder th'Altars smooke,  
> A dreadfull feend, with fowle deformed looke,  
> That stretcht it selfe, as it had long lyen still;  
> And her long taile and fethers strongly shooke,  
> That all the Temple did with terrour fill;  
> Yet him nought terrifide, that feared nothing ill.
>
> An huge great Beast it was, when it in length  
> Was stretched forth, that nigh fild all the place,  
> And seem'd to be of infinite great strength;  
> Horrible, hideous, and of hellish race,  
> Borne of the brooding of *Echidna* base,  
> Or other like infernall furies kinde:  
> For of a Mayd she had the outward face,  
> To hide the horrour, which did lurke behinde,  
> The better to beguile, whom she so fond did finde.
>
> Thereto the body of a dog she had,  
> Full of fell rauin and fierce greedinesse;  
> A Lions clawes, with powre and rigour clad,  
> To rend and teare, what so she can oppresse;  
> A Dragons taile, whose sting without redresse  
> Full deadly wounds, where so it is empight;  
> And Eagles wings, for scope and speedinesse,  
> That nothing may escape her reaching might,  
> Whereto she euer list to make her hardy flight.
>
> Much like in foulnesse and deformity  
> Vnto that Monster, whom the Theban Knight,  
> The father of that fatall progeny,  
> Made kill her selfe for very hearts despight,  
> That he had red her Riddle, which no wight  
> Could euer loose, but suffred deadly doole.  
> So also did this Monster vse like slight  
> To many a one, which came vnto her schoole,  
> Whom she did put to death, deceiued like a foole.
>
> She comming forth, when as she first beheld  
> The armed Prince, with shield so blazing bright,  
> Her ready to assaile, was greatly queld,  
> And much dismayd with that dismayfull sight,  
> That backe she would haue turnd for great affright.  
> But he gan her with courage fierce assay,  
> That forst her turne againe in her despight,  
> To saue her selfe, least that he did her slay:  
> And sure he had her slaine, had she not turnd her way.
>
> Tho when she saw, that she was forst to fight,  
> She flew at him, like to an hellish feend,  
> And on his shield tooke hold with all her might,  
> As if that it she would in peeces rend,  
> Or reaue out of the hand, that did it hend.  
> Strongly he stroue out of her greedy gripe  
> To loose his shield, and long while did contend:  
> But when he could not quite it, with one stripe  
> Her Lions clawes he from her feete away did wipe.
>
> With that aloude she gan to bray and yell,  
> And fowle blasphemous speaches forth did cast,  
> And bitter curses, horrible to tell,  
> That euen the Temple, wherein she was plast,  
> Did quake to heare, and nigh asunder brast.  
> Tho with her huge long taile she at him strooke,  
> That made him stagger, and stand halfe agast  
> With trembling ioynts, as he for terrour shooke;  
> Who nought was terrifide, but greater courage tooke.
>
> As when the Mast of some well timbred hulke  
> Is with the blast of some outragious storme  
> Blowne downe, it shakes the bottome of the bulke,  
> And makes her ribs to cracke, as they were torne,  
> Whilest still she stands as stonisht and forlorne:  
> So was he stound with stroke of her huge taile.  
> But ere that it she backe againe had borne,  
> He with his sword it strooke, that without faile  
> He ioynted it, and mard the swinging of her flaile.
>
> Then gan she cry much louder then afore,  
> That all the people there without it heard,  
> And *Belge* selfe was therewith stonied sore,  
> As if the onely sound thereof she feard.  
> But then the feend her selfe more fiercely reard  
> Vppon her wide great wings, and strongly flew  
> With all her body at his head and beard;  
> That had he not foreseene with heedfull vew,  
> And thrown his shield atween, she had him done to rew.
>
> But as she prest on him with heauy sway,  
> Vnder her wombe his fatall sword he thrust,  
> And for her entrailes made an open way,  
> To issue forth; the which once being brust,  
> Like to a great Mill damb forth fiercely gusht,  
> And powred out of her infernall sinke  
> Most vgly filth, and poyson therewith rusht,  
> That him nigh choked with the deadly stinke:  
> Such loathly matter were small lust to speake, or thinke.
>
> Then downe to ground fell that deformed Masse,  
> Breathing out clouds of sulphure fowle and blacke,  
> In which a puddle of contagion was,  
> More loathd then *Lerna*, or then *Stygian* lake,  
> That any man would nigh awhaped make.  
> Whom when he saw on ground, he was full glad,  
> And streight went forth his gladnesse to partake  
> With *Belge*, who watcht all this while full sad,  
> Wayting what end would be of that same daunger drad.
>
> Whom when she saw so ioyously come forth,  
> She gan reioyce, and shew triumphant chere,  
> Lauding and praysing his renowmed worth,  
> By all the names that honorable were.  
> Then in he brought her, and her shewed there  
> The present of his paines, that Monsters spoyle,  
> And eke that Idoll deem'd so costly dere;  
> Whom he did all to peeces breake and foyle  
> In filthy durt, and left so in the loathely soyle.
>
> Then all the people, which beheld that day,  
> Gan shout aloud, that vnto heauen it rong;  
> And all the damzels of that towne in ray,  
> Came dauncing forth, and ioyous carrols song:  
> So him they led through all their streetes along,  
> Crowned with girlonds of immortall baies,  
> And all the vulgar did about them throng,  
> To see the man, whose euerlasting praise  
> They all were bound to all posterities to raise.
>
> There he with *Belge* did a while remaine,  
> Making great feast and ioyous merriment,  
> Vntill he had her settled in her raine,  
> With safe assuraunce and establishment.  
> Then to his first emprize his mind he lent,  
> Full loath to *Belge*, and to all the rest:  
> Of whom yet taking leaue, thenceforth he went  
> And to his former iourney him addrest,  
> On which long way he rode, ne euer day did rest.
>
> But turne we now to noble *Artegall*;  
> Who hauing left *Mercilla*, streight way went  
> On his first quest, the which him forth did call,  
> To weet to worke *Irenaes* franchisement,  
> And eke *Grantortoes* worthy punishment.  
> So forth he fared as his manner was,  
> With onely *Talus* wayting diligent,  
> Through many perils and much way did pas,  
> Till nigh vnto the place at length approcht he has.
>
> There as he traueld by the way, he met  
> An aged wight, wayfaring all alone,  
> Who through his yeares long since aside had set  
> The vse of armes, and battell quite forgone:  
> To whom as he approcht, he knew anone,  
> That it was he which whilome did attend  
> On faire *Irene* in her affliction,  
> When first to Faery court he saw her wend,  
> Vnto his soueraine Queene her suite for to commend.
>
> Whom by his name saluting, thus he gan;  
> Haile good Sir *Sergis*, truest Knight aliue,  
> Well tride in all thy Ladies troubles than,  
> When her that Tyrant did of Crowne depriue;  
> What new ocasion doth thee hither driue,  
> Whiles she alone is left, and thou here found?  
> Or is she thrall, or doth she not suruiue?  
> To whom he thus; She liueth sure and sound;  
> But by that Tyrant is in wretched thraldome bound.
>
> For she presuming on th'appointed tyde,  
> In which ye promist, as ye were a Knight,  
> To meete her at the saluage Ilands syde,  
> And then and there for triall of her right  
> With her vnrighteous enemy to fight,  
> Did thither come, where she afrayd of nought,  
> By guilefull treason and by subtill slight  
> Surprized was, and to *Grantorto* brought,  
> Who her imprisond hath, and her life often sought.
>
> And now he hath to her prefixt a day,  
> By which if that no champion doe appeare,  
> Which will her cause in battailous array  
> Against him iustifie, and proue her cleare  
> Of all those crimes, that he gainst her doth reare,  
> She death shall by. Those tidings sad  
> Did much abash Sir *Artegall* to heare,  
> And grieued sore, that through his fault she had  
> Fallen into that Tyrants hand and vsage bad.
>
> Then thus replide; Now sure and by my life,  
> Too much am I to blame for that faire Maide,  
> That haue her drawne to all this troublous strife,  
> Through promise to afford her timely aide,  
> Which by default I haue not yet defraide.  
> But witnesse vnto me, ye heauens, that know  
> How cleare I am from blame of this vpbraide:  
> For ye into like thraldome me did throw,  
> And kept from complishing the faith, which I did owe.
>
> But now aread, Sir *Sergis*, how long space,  
> Hath he her lent, a Champion to prouide?  
> Ten daies (quoth he) he graunted hath of grace,  
> For that he weeneth well, before that tide  
> None can haue tidings to assist her side.  
> For all the shores, which to the sea accoste,  
> He day and night doth ward both far and wide,  
> That none can there arriue without an hoste:  
> So her he deemes already but a damned ghoste.
>
> Now turne againe (Sir *Artegall* then sayd)  
> For if I liue till those ten daies haue end,  
> Assure your selfe, Sir Knight, she shall haue ayd,  
> Though I this dearest life for her doe spend;  
> So backeward he attone with him did wend.  
> Tho as they rode together on their way,  
> A rout of people they before them kend,  
> Flocking together in confusde array,  
> As if that there were some tumultuous affray.
>
> To which as they approcht, the cause to know,  
> They saw a Knight in daungerous distresse  
> Of a rude rout him chasing to and fro,  
> That sought with lawlesse powre him to oppresse,  
> And bring in bondage of their brutishnesse:  
> And farre away, amid their rakehell bands,  
> They spide a Lady left all succourlesse,  
> Crying, and holding vp her wretched hands  
> To him for aide, who long in vaine their rage withstands.
>
> Yet still he striues, ne any perill spares,  
> To reskue her from their rude violence,  
> And like a Lion wood amongst them fares,  
> Dealing his dreadfull blowes with large dispence,  
> Gainst which the pallid death findes no defence.  
> But all in vaine, their numbers are so great,  
> That naught may boot to banishe them from thence:  
> For soone as he their outrage backe doth beat,  
> They turne afresh, and oft renew their former threat.
>
> And now they doe so sharpely him assay,  
> That they his shield in peeces battred haue,  
> And forced him to throw it quite away,  
> Fro dangers dread his doubtfull life to saue;  
> Albe that it most safety to him gaue,  
> And much did magnifie his noble name.  
> For from the day that he thus did it leaue,  
> Amongst all Knights he blotted was with blame,  
> And counted but a recreant Knight, with endles shame.
>
> Whom when they thus distressed did behold,  
> They drew vnto his aide; but that rude rout  
> Them also gan assaile with outrage bold,  
> And forced them, how euer strong and stout  
> They were, as well approu'd in many a doubt,  
> Backe to recule; vntill that yron man  
> With his huge flaile began to lay about;  
> From whose sterne presence they diffused ran,  
> Like scattred chaffe, the which the wind away doth fan.
>
> So when that Knight from perill cleare was freed,  
> He drawing neare, began to greete them faire,  
> And yeeld great thankes for their so goodly deed,  
> In sauing him from daungerous despaire  
> Of those, which sought his life for to empaire.  
> Of whom Sir *Artegall* gan then enquire  
> The whole occasion of his late misfare,  
> And who he was, and what those villaines were,  
> The which with mortall malice him pursu'd so nere.
>
> To whom he thus; My name is *Burbon* hight,  
> Well knowne, and far renowmed heretofore,  
> Vntill late mischiefe did vppon me light,  
> That all my former praise hath blemisht sore;  
> And that faire Lady, which in that vprore  
> Ye with those caytiues saw, *Flourdelis* hight,  
> Is mine owne loue, though me she haue forlore,  
> Whether withheld from me by wrongfull might,  
> Or with her owne good will, I cannot read aright.
>
> But sure to me her faith she first did plight,  
> To be my loue, and take me for her Lord,  
> Till that a Tyrant, which *Grandtorto* hight,  
> With golden giftes and many a guilefull word  
> Entyced her, to him for to accord.  
> O who may not with gifts and words be tempted?  
> Sith which she hath me euer since abhord,  
> And to my foe hath guilefully consented:  
> Ay me, that euer guyle in wemen was inuented.
>
> And now he hath this troupe of villains sent,  
> By open force to fetch her quite away:  
> Gainst whom my selfe I long in vaine haue bent,  
> To rescue her, and daily meanes assay,  
> Yet rescue her thence by no meanes I may:  
> For they doe me with multitude oppresse,  
> And with vnequall might doe ouerlay,  
> That oft I driuen am to great distresse,  
> And forced to forgoe th'attempt remedilesse.
>
> But why haue ye (said *Artegall*) forborne  
> Your owne good shield in daungerous dismay?  
> That is the greatest shame and foulest scorne,  
> Which vnto any knight behappen may  
> To loose the badge, that should his deedes display.  
> To whom Sir *Burbon*, blushing halfe for shame,  
> That shall I vnto you (quoth he) bewray;  
> Least ye therefore mote happily me blame,  
> And deeme it doen of will, that through inforcement came.
>
> True is, that I at first was dubbed knight  
> By a good knight, the knight of the *Redcrosse*;  
> Who when he gaue me armes, in field to fight,  
> Gaue me a shield, in which he did endosse  
> His deare Redeemers badge vpon the bosse:  
> The same longwhile I bore, and therewithall  
> Fought many battels without wound or losse;  
> Therewith *Grandtorto* selfe I did appall,  
> And made him oftentimes in field before me fall.
>
> But for that many did that shield enuie,  
> And cruell enemies increased more;  
> To stint all strife and troublous enmitie,  
> That bloudie scutchin being battered sore,  
> I layd aside, and haue of late forbore,  
> Hoping thereby to haue my loue obtayned:  
> Yet can I not my loue haue nathemore;  
> For she by force is still fro me detayned,  
> And with corruptfull brybes is to vntruth mis-trayned.
>
> To whom thus *Artegall*; Certes Sir knight,  
> Hard is the case, the which ye doe complaine;  
> Yet not so hard (for nought so hard may light,  
> That it to such a streight mote you constraine)  
> As to abandon, that which doth containe  
> Your honours stile, that is your warlike shield.  
> All perill ought be lesse, and lesse all paine  
> Then losse of fame in disauentrous field;  
> Dye rather, then doe ought, that mote dishonour yield.
>
> Not so; (quoth he) for yet when time doth serue,  
> My former shield I may resume againe:  
> To temporize is not from truth to swerue,  
> Ne for aduantage terme to entertaine,  
> When as necessitie doth it constraine.  
> Fie on such forgerie (said *Artegall*)  
> Vnder one hood to shadow faces twaine.  
> Knights ought be true, and truth is one in all:  
> Of all things to dissemble fouly may befall.
>
> Yet let me you of courtesie request,  
> (Said *Burbon*) to assist me now at need  
> Against these pesants, which haue me opprest,  
> And forced me to so infamous deed,  
> That yet my loue may from their hands be freed.  
> Sir *Artegall*, albe he earst did wyte  
> His wauering mind, yet to his aide agreed,  
> And buckling him eftsoones vnto the fight,  
> Did set vpon those troupes with all his powre and might.
>
> Who flocking round about them, as a swarme  
> Of flyes vpon a birchen bough doth cluster,  
> Did them assault with terrible allarme,  
> And ouer all the fields themselues did muster,  
> With bils and glayues making a dreadfull luster;  
> That forst at first those knights backe to retyre:  
> As when the wrathfull *Boreas* doth bluster,  
> Nought may abide the tempest of his yre,  
> Both man and beast doe fly, and succour doe inquyre.
>
> But when as ouerblowen was that brunt,  
> Those knights began a fresh them to assayle,  
> And all about the fields like Squirrels hunt;  
> But chiefly *Talus* with his yron flayle,  
> Gainst which no flight nor rescue mote auayle,  
> Made cruell hauocke of the baser crew,  
> And chaced them both ouer hill and dale:  
> The raskall manie soone they ouerthrew,  
> But the two knights themselues their captains did subdew.
>
> At last they came whereas that Ladie bode,  
> Whom now her keepers had forsaken quight,  
> To saue themselues, and scattered were abrode:  
> Her halfe dismayd they found in doubtfull plight,  
> As neither glad nor sorie for their sight;  
> Yet wondrous faire she was, and richly clad  
> In roiall robes, and many Iewels dight,  
> But that those villens through their vsage bad  
> Them fouly rent, and shamefully defaced had.
>
> But *Burbon* streight dismounting from his steed,  
> Vnto her ran with greedie great desyre,  
> And catching her fast by her ragged weed,  
> Would haue embraced her with hart entyre.  
> But she backstarting with disdainefull yre,  
> Bad him auaunt, ne would vnto his lore  
> Allured be, for prayer nor for meed.  
> Whom when those knights so froward and forlore  
> Beheld, they her rebuked and vpbrayded sore.
>
> Sayd *Artegall*; What foule disgrace is this,  
> To so faire Ladie, as ye seeme in sight,  
> To blot your beautie, that vnblemisht is,  
> With so foule blame, as breach of faith once plight,  
> Or change of loue for any worlds delight?  
> Is ought on earth so pretious or deare,  
> As prayse and honour? Or is ought so bright  
> And beautifull, as glories beames appeare,  
> Whose goodly light then *Phebus* lampe doth shine more cleare?
>
> Why then will ye, fond Dame, attempted bee  
> Vnto a strangers loue so lightly placed,  
> For guiftes of gold, or any worldly glee,  
> To leaue the loue, that ye before embraced,  
> And let your fame with falshood be defaced?  
> Fie on the pelfe, for which good name is sold,  
> And honour with indignitie debased:  
> Dearer is loue then life, and fame then gold;  
> But dearer then thẽ both, your faith once plighted hold.
>
> Much was the Ladie in her gentle mind  
> Abasht at his rebuke, that bit her neare,  
> Ne ought to answere thereunto did find;  
> But hanging downe her head with heauie cheare,  
> Stood long amaz'd, as she amated weare.  
> Which *Burbon* seeing, her againe assayd,  
> And clasping twixt his armes, her vp did reare  
> Vpon his steede, whiles she no whit gainesayd,  
> So bore her quite away, nor well nor ill apayd.
>
> Nathlesse the yron man did still pursew  
> That raskall many with vnpittied spoyle;  
> Ne ceassed not, till all their scattred crew  
> Into the sea he droue quite from that soyle,  
> The which they troubled had with great turmoyle.  
> But *Artegall* seeing his cruell deed,  
> Commaunded him from slaughter to recoyle,  
> And to his voyage gan againe proceed:  
> For that the terme approching fast, required speed.
