*Cant. VIII.*

> *Sir Guyon laid in swowne is by  
> Acrates sonnes despoyld,  
> Whom Arthur soone hath reskewed  
> And Paynim brethren foyld.*

> A Nd is there care in heauen? and is there loue  
> In heauenly spirits to these creatures bace,  
> That may compassion of their euils moue?  
> There is: else much more wretched were the cace  
> Of men, then beasts. But ô th'exceeding grace  
> Of highest God, that loues his creatures so,  
> And all his workes with mercy doth embrace,  
> That blessed Angels, he sends to and fro,  
> To serue to wicked man, to serue his wicked foe.
>
> How oft do they, their siluer bowers leaue,  
> To come to succour vs, that succour want?  
> How oft do they with golden pineons, cleaue  
> The flitting skyes, like flying Pursuiuant,  
> Against foule feends to aide vs millitant?  
> They for vs fight, they watch and dewly ward,  
> And their bright Squadrons round about vs plant,  
> And all for loue, and nothing for reward:  
> O why should heauenly God to man haue such regard?
>
> During the while, that *Guyon* did abide  
> In *Mammons* house, the Palmer, whom whyleare  
> That wanton Mayd of passage had denide,  
> By further search had passage found elsewhere,  
> And being on his way, approched neare,  
> Where *Guyon* lay in traunce, when suddenly  
> He heard a voice, that called loud and cleare,  
> Come hither, come hither, ô come hastily;  
> That all the fields resounded with the ruefull cry.
>
> The Palmer lent his eare vnto the noyce,  
> To weet, who called so importunely:  
> Againe he heard a more efforced voyce,  
> That bad him come in haste. He by and by  
> His feeble feet directed to the cry;  
> Which to that shadie delue him brought at last,  
> Where *Mammon* earst did sunne his threasury:  
> There the good *Guyon* he found slumbring fast  
> In senselesse dreame; which sight at first him sore aghast.
>
> Beside his head there sate a faire young man,  
> Of wondrous beautie, and of freshest yeares,  
> Whose tender bud to blossome new began,  
> And flourish faire aboue his equall peares;  
> His snowy front curled with golden heares,  
> Like *Phoebus* face adornd with sunny rayes,  
> Diuinely shone, and two sharpe winged sheares,  
> Decked with diuerse plumes, like painted Iayes,  
> Were fixed at his backe, to cut his ayerie wayes.
>
> Like as *Cupido* on *Idæan* hill,  
> When hauing laid his cruell bow away,  
> And mortall arrowes, wherewith he doth fill  
> The world with murdrous spoiles and bloudie pray,  
> With his faire mother he him dights to play,  
> And with his goodly sisters, *Graces* three;  
> The Goddesse pleased with his wanton play,  
> Suffers her selfe through sleepe beguild to bee,  
> The whiles the other Ladies mind their merry glee.
>
> Whom when the Palmer saw, abasht he was  
> Through fear and wonder, that he nought could say,  
> Till him the child bespoke, Long lackt, alas,  
> Hath bene thy faithfull aide in hard assay,  
> Whiles deadly fit thy pupill doth dismay;  
> Behold this heauie sight, thou reuerend Sire,  
> But dread of death and dolour doe away;  
> For life ere long shall to her home retire,  
> And he that breathlesse seemes, shal corage bold respire.
>
> The charge, which God doth vnto me arret,  
> Of his deare safetie, I to thee commend;  
> Yet will I not forgoe, ne yet forget  
> The care thereof my selfe vnto the end,  
> But euermore him succour, and defend  
> Against his foe and mine: watch thou I pray;  
> For euill is at hand him to offend.  
> So hauing said, eftsoones he gan display  
> His painted nimble wings, and vanisht quite away.
>
> The Palmer seeing his left empty place,  
> And his slow eyes beguiled of their sight,  
> Woxe sore affraid, and standing still a space,  
> Gaz'd after him, as fowle escapt by flight;  
> At last him turning to his charge behight,  
> With trembling hand his troubled pulse gan try;  
> Where finding life not yet dislodged quight,  
> He much reioyst, and courd it tenderly,  
> As chicken newly hatcht, from dreaded destiny.
>
> At last he spide, where towards him did pace  
> Two Paynim knights, all armd as bright as skie,  
> And them beside an aged Sire did trace,  
> And farre before a light-foot Page did flie,  
> That breathed strife and troublous enmitie;  
> Those were the two sonnes of *Acrates* old  
> Who meeting earst with *Archimago* slie,  
> Foreby that idle strond, of him were told,  
> That he, wich earst them combatted, was *Guyon* bold.
>
> Which to auenge on him they dearely vowd,  
> Where euer that on ground they mote him fynd;  
> False *Archimage* prouokt their courage prowd,  
> And stryfull *Atin* in their stubborne mynd  
> Coles of contention and whot vengeance tynd.  
> Now bene they come, whereas the Palmer sate,  
> Keeping that slombred corse to him assynd;  
> Well knew they both his person, sith of late  
> With him in bloudie armes they rashly did debate.
>
> Whom when *Pyrrochles* saw, inflam'd with rage,  
> That sire he foule bespake, Thou dotard vile,  
> That with thy brutenesse shendst thy comely age,  
> Abandone soone, I read, the caitiue spoile  
> Of that same outcast carkasse, that erewhile  
> Made it selfe famous through false trechery,  
> And crownd his coward crest with knightly stile;  
> Loe where he now inglorious doth lye,  
> To proue he liued ill, that did thus foully dye.
>
> To whom the Palmer fearelesse answered;  
> Certes, Sir knight, ye bene too much to blame,  
> Thus for to blot the honour of the dead,  
> And with foule cowardize his carkasse shame,  
> Whose liuing hands immortalizd his name.  
> Vile is the vengeance on the ashes cold,  
> And enuie base, to barke at sleeping fame:  
> Was neuer wight, that treason of him told;  
> Your selfe his prowesse prou'd & found him fiers & bold.
>
> Then said *Cymochles*; Palmer, thou doest dote,  
> Ne canst of prowesse, ne of knighthood deeme,  
> Saue as thou seest or hearst. But well I wote,  
> That of his puissance tryall made extreeme;  
> Yet gold all is not, that doth golden seeme,  
> Ne all good knights, that shake well speare and shield:  
> The worth of all men by their end esteeme,  
> And then due praise, or due reproch them yield;  
> Bad therefore I him deeme, that thus lies dead on field.
>
> Good or bad (gan his brother fierce reply)  
> What doe I recke, sith that he dyde entire?  
> Or what doth his bad death now satisfy  
> The greedy hunger of reuenging ire,  
> Sith wrathfull hand wrought not her owne desire?  
> Yet since no way is left to wreake my spight,  
> I will him reaue of armes, the victors hire,  
> And of that shield, more worthy of good knight;  
> For why should a dead dog be deckt in armour bright?
>
> Faire Sir, said then the Palmer suppliaunt,  
> For knighthoods loue, do not so foule a deed,  
> Ne blame your honour with so shamefull vaunt  
> Of vile reuenge. To spoile the dead of weed  
> Is sacrilege, and doth all sinnes exceed;  
> But leaue these relicks of his liuing might,  
> To decke his herce, and trap his tomb-blacke steed.  
> What herce or steed (said he) should he haue dight,  
> But be entombed in the rauen or the kight?
>
> With that, rude hand vpon his shield he laid,  
> And th'other brother gan his helme vnlace,  
> Both fiercely bent to haue him disaraid;  
> Till that they spide, where towards them did pace  
> An armed knight, of bold and bounteous grace,  
> Whose squire bore after him an heben launce,  
> And couerd shield. Well kend him so farre space  
> Th'enchaunter by his armes and amenaunce,  
> When vnder him he saw his Lybian steed to praunce.
>
> And to those brethren said, Rise rise by liue,  
> And vnto battell doe your selues addresse;  
> For yonder comes the prowest knight aliue,  
> Prince *Arthur*, flowre of grace and nobilesse,  
> That hath to Paynim knights wrought great distresse,  
> And thousand Sar'zins foully donne to dye.  
> That word so deepe did in their harts impresse,  
> That both eftsoones vpstarted furiously,  
> And gan themselues prepare to battell greedily.
>
> But fierce *Pyrrochles*, lacking his owne sword,  
> The want thereof now greatly gan to plaine,  
> And *Archimage* besought, him that afford,  
> Which he had brought for *Braggadocchio* vaine.  
> So would I (said th'enchaunter) glad and faine  
> Beteeme to you this sword, you to defend,  
> Or ought that else your honour might maintaine,  
> But that this weapons powre I well haue kend,  
> To be contrarie to the worke, which ye intend.
>
> For that same knights owne sword this is of yore,  
> Which *Merlin* made by his almightie art  
> For that his noursling, when he knighthood swore,  
> Therewith to doen his foes eternall smart.  
> The metall first he mixt with *Medæwart*,  
> That no enchauntment from his dint might saue;  
> That it in flames of *Aetna* wrought apart,  
> And seuen times dipped in the bitter waue  
> Of hellish *Styx*, which hidden vertue to it gaue.
>
> The vertue is, that neither steele, nor stone  
> The stroke thereof from entrance may defend;  
> Ne euer may be vsed by his fone,  
> Ne forst his rightfull owner to offend,  
> Ne euer will it breake, ne euer bend.  
> Wherefore *Morddure* it rightfully is hight.  
> In vaine therefore, *Pyrrochles*, should I lend  
> The same to thee, against his lord to fight,  
> For sure it would deceiue thy labour, and thy might.
>
> Foolish old man, said then the Pagan wroth,  
> That weenest words or charmes may force withstond:  
> Soone shalt thou see, and then beleeue for troth,  
> That I can carue with this inchaunted brond  
> His Lords owne flesh. Therewith out of his hond  
> That vertuous steele he rudely snatcht away,  
> And *Guyons* shield about his wrest he bond;  
> So readie dight, fierce battaile to assay,  
> And match his brother proud in battailous array.
>
> By this that straunger knight in presence came,  
> And goodly salued them; who nought againe  
> Him answered, as courtesie became,  
> But with sterne lookes, and stomachous disdaine,  
> Gaue signes of grudge and discontentment vaine:  
> Then turning to the Palmer, he gan spy  
> Where at his feete, with sorrowfull demaine  
> And deadly hew, an armed corse did lye,  
> In whose dead face he red great magnanimity.
>
> Said he then to the Palmer, Reuerend syre,  
> What great misfortune hath betidd this knight?  
> Or did his life her fatall date expyre,  
> Or did he fall by treason, or by fight?  
> How euer, sure I rew his pitteous plight.  
> Not one, nor other, (said the Palmer graue)  
> Hath him befalne, but cloudes of deadly night  
> A while his heauie eylids couer'd haue,  
> And all his senses drowned in deepe senselesse waue.
>
> Which, those his cruell foes, that stand hereby,  
> Making aduantage, to reuenge their spight,  
> Would him disarme, and treaten shamefully,  
> Vnworthy vsage of redoubted knight.  
> But you, faire Sir, whose honorable sight  
> Doth promise hope of helpe, and timely grace,  
> Mote I beseech to succour his sad plight,  
> And by your powre protect his feeble cace.  
> First praise of knighthood is, foule outrage to deface.
>
> Palmer, (said he) no knight so rude, I weene,  
> As to doen outrage to a sleeping ghost:  
> Ne was there euer noble courage seene,  
> That in aduauntage would his puissance bost:  
> Honour is least, where oddes appeareth most.  
> May be, that better reason will asswage  
> The rash reuengers heat. Words well dispost  
> Haue secret powre, t'appease inflamed rage:  
> If not, leaue vnto me thy knights last patronage.
>
> Tho turning to those brethren, thus bespoke,  
> Ye warlike payre, whose valorous great might  
> It seemes, iust wrongs to vengeance doe prouoke,  
> To wreake your wrath on this dead seeming knight,  
> Mote ought allay the storme of your despight,  
> And settle patience in so furious heat?  
> Not to debate the chalenge of your right,  
> But for this carkasse pardon I entreat,  
> Whom fortune hath alreadie laid in lowest seat.
>
> To whom *Cymochles* said; For what art thou,  
> That mak'st thy selfe his dayes-man, to prolong  
> The vengeance prest? Or who shall let me now,  
> On this vile bodie from to wreake my wrong,  
> And make his carkasse as the outcast dong?  
> Why should not that dead carrion satisfie  
> The guilt, which if he liued had thus long,  
> His life for due reuenge should deare abie?  
> The trespasse still doth liue, albe the person die.
>
> Indeed (then said the Prince) the euill donne  
> Dyes not, when breath the bodie first doth leaue,  
> But from the grandsyre to the Nephewes sonne,  
> And all his seed the curse doth often cleaue,  
> Till vengeance vtterly the guilt bereaue:  
> So streightly God doth iudge. But gentle knight,  
> That doth against the dead his hand vpreare,  
> His honour staines with rancour and despight,  
> And great disparagment makes to his former might.
>
> *Pyrrochles* gan reply the second time,  
> And to him said, Now felon sure I read,  
> How that thou art partaker of his crime:  
> Therefore by *Termagaunt* thou shalt be dead.  
> With that his hand, more sad then lomp of lead,  
> Vplifting high, he weened with *Morddure*,  
> His owne good sword *Morddure*, to cleaue his head.  
> The faithfull steele such treason no'uld endure,  
> But swaruing from the marke, his Lords life did assure.
>
> Yet was the force so furious and so fell,  
> That horse and man it made to reele aside;  
> Nath'lesse the Prince would not forsake his sell:  
> For well of yore he learned had to ride,  
> But full of anger fiercely to him cride;  
> False traitour miscreant, thou broken hast  
> The law of armes, to strike foe vndefide.  
> But thou thy treasons fruit, I hope, shalt taste  
> Right sowre, & feele the law, the which thou hast defast.
>
> With that his balefull speare, he fiercely bent  
> Against the Pagans brest, and therewith thought  
> His cursed life out of her lodge haue rent:  
> But ere the point arriued, where it ought,  
> That seuen-fold shield, which he from *Guyon* brought  
> He cast betwene to ward the bitter stound:  
> Through all those foldes the steelehead passage wrought  
> And through his shoulder pierst; wherwith to groũd  
> He groueling fell, all gored in his gushing wound.
>
> Which when his brother saw, fraught with great griefe  
> And wrath, he to him leaped furiously,  
> And fowly said, By *Mahoune*, cursed thiefe,  
> That direfull stroke thou dearely shalt aby.  
> Then hurling vp his harmefull blade on hye,  
> Smote him so hugely on his haughtie crest,  
> That from his saddle forced him to fly:  
> Else mote it needes downe to his manly brest  
> Haue cleft his head in twaine, and life thence dispossest.
>
> Now was the Prince in daungerous distresse,  
> Wanting his sword, when he on foot should fight:  
> His single speare could doe him small redresse,  
> Against two foes of so exceeding might,  
> The least of which was match for any knight.  
> And now the other, whom he earst did daunt,  
> Had reard himselfe againe to cruell fight,  
> Three times more furious, and more puissaunt,  
> Vnmindfull of his wound, of his fate ignoraunt.
>
> So both attonce him charge on either side,  
> With hideous strokes, and importable powre,  
> That forced him his ground to trauerse wide,  
> And wisely watch to ward that deadly stowre:  
> For in his shield, as thicke as stormie showre,  
> Their strokes did raine, yet did he neuer quaile,  
> Ne backward shrinke, but as a stedfast towre,  
> Whom foe with double battry doth assaile,  
> Them on her bulwarke beares, and bids them nought auaile.
>
> So stoutly he withstood their strong assay,  
> Till that at last, when he aduantage spyde,  
> His poinant speare he thrust with puissant sway  
> At proud *Cymochles*, whiles his shield was wyde,  
> That through his thigh the mortall steele did gryde:  
> He swaruing with the force, within his flesh  
> Did breake the launce, and let the head abyde:  
> Out of the wound the red bloud flowed fresh,  
> That vnderneath his feet soone made a purple plesh.
>
> Horribly then he gan to rage, and rayle,  
> Cursing his Gods, and himselfe damning deepe:  
> Als when his brother saw the red bloud rayle  
> Adowne so fast, and all his armour steepe,  
> For very felnesse lowd he gan to weepe,  
> And said, Caytiue, cursse on thy cruell hond,  
> That twise hath sped; yet shall it not thee keepe  
> From the third brunt of this my fatall brond:  
> Loe where the dreadfull Death behind thy backe doth stond.
>
> With that he strooke, and th'other strooke withall,  
> That nothing seem'd mote beare so monstrous might:  
> The one vpon his couered shield did fall,  
> And glauncing downe would not his owner byte:  
> But th'other did vpon his troncheon smyte,  
> Which hewing quite a sunder, further way  
> It made, and on his hacqueton did lyte,  
> The which diuiding with importune sway,  
> It seizd in his right side, and there the dint did stay.
>
> Wyde was the wound, and a large lukewarme flood,  
> Red as the Rose, thence gushed grieuously;  
> That when the Paynim spyde the streaming blood,  
> Gaue him great hart, and hope of victory.  
> On th'other side, in huge perplexity,  
> The Prince now stood, hauing his weapon broke;  
> Nought could he hurt, but still at ward did ly:  
> Yet with his troncheon he so rudely stroke  
> *Cymochles* twise, that twise him forst his foot reuoke.
>
> Whom when the Palmer saw in such distresse,  
> Sir *Guyons* sword he lightly to him raught,  
> And said; Faire Son, great God thy right hand blesse,  
> To vse that sword so wisely as it ought.  
> Glad was the knight, & with fresh courage fraught,  
> When as againe he armed felt his hond;  
> Then like a Lion, which hath long time saught  
> His robbed whelpes, and at the last them fond  
> Emongst the shepheard swaynes, then wexeth wood & yond.
>
> So fierce he laid about him, and dealt blowes  
> On either side, that neither mayle could hold,  
> Ne shield defend the thunder of his throwes:  
> Now to *Pyrrochles* many strokes he told;  
> Eft to *Cymochles* twise so many fold:  
> Then backe againe turning his busie hond,  
> Them both attonce compeld with courage bold,  
> To yield wide way to his hart-thrilling brond;  
> And though they both stood stiffe, yet could not both withstond.
>
> As saluage Bull, whom two fierce mastiues bayt,  
> When rancour doth with rage him once engore,  
> Forgets with warie ward them to awayt,  
> But with his dreadfull hornes them driues afore,  
> Or flings aloft, or treads downe in the flore,  
> Breathing out wrath, and bellowing disdaine,  
> That all the forrest quakes to heare him rore:  
> So rag'd Prince *Arthur* twixt his foemen twaine,  
> That neither could his mightie puissance sustaine.
>
> But euer at *Pyrrochles* when he smit,  
> Who *Guyons* shield cast euer him before,  
> Whereon the Faery Queenes pourtract was writ,  
> His hand relented, and the stroke forbore,  
> And his deare hart the picture gan adore,  
> Which oft the Paynim sau'd from deadly stowre.  
> But him henceforth the same can saue no more;  
> For now arriued is his fatall howre,  
> That no'te auoyded be by earthly skill or powre.
>
> For when *Cymochles* saw the fowle reproch,  
> Which them appeached, prickt with guilty shame,  
> And inward griefe, he fiercely gan approch,  
> Resolu'd to put away that loathly blame,  
> Or dye with honour and desert of fame;  
> And on the hauberk stroke the Prince so sore,  
> That quite disparted all the linked frame,  
> And pierced to the skin, but bit no more,  
> Yet made him twise to reele, that neuer moou'd afore.
>
> Whereat renfierst with wrath and sharpe regret,  
> He stroke so hugely with his borrowd blade,  
> That it empierst the Pagans burganet,  
> And cleauing the hard steele, did deepe inuade  
> Into his head, and cruell passage made  
> Quite through his braine. He tombling downe on ground,  
> Breathd out his ghost, which to th'infernall shade  
> Fast flying, there eternall torment found,  
> For all the sinnes, wherewith his lewd life did abound.
>
> Which when his german saw, the stony feare  
> Ran to his hart, and all his sence dismayd,  
> Ne thenceforth life ne courage did appeare,  
> But as a man, whom hellish feends haue frayd,  
> Long trembling still he stood: at last thus sayd;  
> Traytour what hast thou doen? how euer may  
> Thy cursed hand so cruelly haue swayd  
> Against that knight: Harrow and well away,  
> After so wicked deed why liu'st thou lenger day?
>
> With that all desperate as loathing light,  
> And with reuenge desiring soone to dye,  
> Assembling all his force and vtmost might,  
> With his owne sword he fierce at him did flye,  
> And strooke, and foynd, and lasht outrageously,  
> Withouten reason or regard. Well knew  
> The Prince, with patience and sufferaunce sly  
> So hasty heat soone cooled to subdew:  
> Tho when this breathlesse woxe, that batteil gan renew.
>
> As when a windy tempest bloweth hye,  
> That nothing may withstand his stormy stowre,  
> The cloudes, as things affrayd, before him flye;  
> But all so soone as his outrageous powre  
> Is layd, they fiercely then begin to shoure,  
> And as in scorne of his spent stormy spight,  
> Now all attonce their malice forth do poure;  
> So did Sir *Guyon*\[Prince *Arthur*\] beare himselfe in fight,  
> And suffred rash *Pyrrochles* wast his idle might.
>
> At last when as the Sarazin perceiu'd,  
> How that straunge sword refusd, to serue his need,  
> But when he stroke most strong, the dint deceiu'd,  
> He flong it from him, and deuoyd of dreed,  
> Vpon him lightly leaping without heed,  
> Twixt his two mighty armes engrasped fast,  
> Thinking to ouerthrow and downe him tred:  
> But him in strength and skill the Prince surpast,  
> And through his nimble sleight did vnder him down cast.
>
> Nought booted it the Paynim then to striue;  
> For as a Bittur in the Eagles claw,  
> That may not hope by flight to scape aliue,  
> Still waites for death with dread and trembling aw;  
> So he now subiect to the victours law,  
> Did not once moue, nor vpward cast his eye,  
> For vile disdaine and rancour, which did gnaw  
> His hart in twaine with sad melancholy,  
> As one that loathed life, and yet despisd to dye.
>
> But full of Princely bounty and great mind,  
> The Conquerour nought cared him to slay,  
> But casting wrongs and all reuenge behind,  
> More glory thought to giue life, then decay,  
> And said, Paynim, this is thy dismall day;  
> Yet if thou wilt renounce thy miscreaunce,  
> And my trew liegeman yield thy selfe for ay,  
> Life will I graunt thee for thy valiaunce,  
> And all thy wrongs will wipe out of my souenaunce.
>
> Foole (said the Pagan) I thy gift defye,  
> But vse thy fortune, as it doth befall,  
> And say, that I not ouercome do dye,  
> But in despight of life, for death do call.  
> Wroth was the Prince, and sory yet withall,  
> That he so wilfully refused grace;  
> Yet sith his fate so cruelly did fall,  
> His shining Helmet he gan soone vnlace,  
> And left his headlesse body bleeding all the place.
>
> By this Sir *Guyon* from his traunce awakt,  
> Life hauing maistered her sencelesse foe;  
> And looking vp, when as his shield he lakt,  
> And sword saw not, he wexed wondrous woe:  
> But when the Palmer, whom he long ygoe  
> Had lost, he by him spide, right glad he grew,  
> And said, Deare sir, whom wandring to and fro  
> I long haue lackt, I ioy thy face to vew;  
> Firme is thy faith, whom daunger neuer fro me drew.
>
> But read what wicked hand hath robbed mee  
> Of my good sword and shield? The Palmer glad,  
> With so fresh hew vprising him to see,  
> Him answered; Faire sonne, be no whit sad  
> For want of weapons, they shall soone be had.  
> So gan he to discourse the whole debate,  
> Which that straunge knight for him sustained had,  
> And those two Sarazins confounded late,  
> Whose carcases on ground were horribly prostrate.
>
> Which when he heard, and saw the tokens trew,  
> His hart with great affection was embayd,  
> And to the Prince bowing with reuerence dew,  
> As to the Patrone of his life, thus sayd;  
> My Lord, my liege, by whose most gratious ayd  
> I liue this day, and see my foes subdewd,  
> What may suffise, to be for meede repayd  
> Of so great graces, as ye haue me shewd,  
> But to be euer bound
>
> To whom the Infant thus, Faire Sir, what need  
> Good turnes be counted, as a seruile bond,  
> To bind their doers, to receiue their meede?  
> Are not all knights by oath bound, to withstond  
> Oppressours powre by armes and puissant hond?  
> Suffise, that I haue done my dew in place.  
> So goodly purpose they together fond,  
> Of kindnesse and of curteous aggrace;  
> The whiles false *Archimarge* and *Atin* fled apace.
