<blockquote>
<i>Prince Arthure ouercomes Disdaine,<br>
Quites Mirabell from dreed:<br>
Serena, found of Saluages,<br>
By Calepine is freed.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
Y
e gentle Ladies, in whose soueraine powre<br>
Loue hath the glory of his kingdome left,<br>
And th'hearts of men, as your eternall dowre,<br>
In yron chaines, of liberty bereft,<br>
Deliuered hath into your hands by gift;<br>
Be well aware, how ye the same doe vse,<br>
That pride doe not to tyranny you lift;<br>
Least if men you of cruelty accuse,<br>
He from you take that chiefedome, which ye doe abuse.<p>

And as ye soft and tender are by kynde,<br>
Adornd with goodly gifts of beauties grace,<br>
So be ye soft and tender eeke in mynde;<br>
But cruelty and hardnesse from you chace,<br>
That all your other praises will deface,<br>
And from you turne the loue of men to hate.<br>
Ensample take of <i>Mirabellaes</i> case,<br>
Who from the high degree of happy state,<br>
Fell into wretched woes, which she repented late.<p>

Who after thraldome of the gentle Squire,<br>
Which she beheld with lamentable eye,<br>
Was touched with compassion entire,<br>
And much lamented his calamity,<br>
That for her sake fell into misery:<br>
Which booted nought for prayers, nor for threat<br>
To hope for to release or mollify;<br>
For aye the more, that she did them entreat,<br>
The more they him misust, and cruelly did beat.<p>

So as they forward on their way did pas,<br>
Him still reuiling and afflicting sore,<br>
They met Prince <i>Arthure</i> with Sir <i>Enias</i>,<br>
(That was that courteous Knight, whom he before<br>
Hauing subdew'd, yet did to life restore,)<br>
To whom as they approcht, they gan augment<br>
Their cruelty, and him to punish more,<br>
Scourging and haling him more vehement;<br>
As if it them should grieue to see his punishment.<p>

The Squire him selfe when as he saw his Lord,<br>
The witnesse of his wretchednesse, in place,<br>
Was much asham'd, that with an hempen cord<br>
He like a dog was led in captiue case,<br>
And did his head for bashfulnesse abase,<br>
As loth to see, or to be seene at all:<br>
Shame would be hid. But whenas <i>Enias</i><br>
Beheld two such, of two such villaines thrall,<br>
His manly mynde was much emmoued therewithall.<p>

And to the Prince thus sayd; See you Sir Knight,<br>
The greatest shame that euer eye yet saw?<br>
Yond Lady and her Squire with foule despight<br>
Abusde, against all reason and all law,<br>
Without regard of pitty or of awe.<br>
See how they doe that Squire beat and reuile;<br>
See how they doe the Lady hale and draw.<br>
But if ye please to lend me leaue a while,<br>
I will them soone acquite, and both of blame assoile.<p>

The Prince assented, and then he streight way<br>
Dismounting light, his shield about him threw,<br>
With which approching, thus he gan to say;<br>
Abide ye caytiue treachetours vntrew,<br>
That haue with treason thralled vnto you<br>
These two, vnworthy of your wretched bands;<br>
And now your crime with cruelty pursew.<br>
Abide, and from them lay your loathly hands;<br>
Or else abide the death, that hard before you stands.<p>

The villaine stayd not aunswer to inuent,<br>
But with his yron club preparing way,<br>
His mindes sad message backe vnto him sent;<br>
The which descended with such dreadfull sway,<br>
That seemed nought the course thereof could stay:<br>
No more then lightening from the lofty sky.<br>
Ne list the Knight the powre thereof assay,<br>
Whose doome was death, but lightly slipping by,<br>
Vnwares defrauded his intended destiny.<p>

And to requite him with the like againe,<br>
With his sharpe sword he fiercely at him flew,<br>
And strooke so strongly, that the Carle with paine<br>
Saued him selfe, but that he there him slew:<br>
Yet sau'd not so, but that the bloud it drew,<br>
And gaue his foe good hope of victory.<br>
Who therewith flesht, vpon him set anew,<br>
And with the second stroke, thought certainely<br>
To haue supplyde the first, and paide the vsury.<p>

But Fortune aunswerd not vnto his call;<br>
For as his hand was heaued vp on hight,<br>
The villaine met him in the middle fall,<br>
And with his club bet backe his brondyron bright<br>
So forcibly, that with his owne hands might<br>
Rebeaten backe vpon him selfe againe,<br>
He driuen was to ground in selfe despight;<br>
From whence ere he recouery could gaine,<br>
He in his necke had set his foote with fell disdaine.<p>

With that the foole, which did that end awayte,<br>
Came running in, and whilest on ground he lay,<br>
Laide heauy hands on him, and held so strayte,<br>
That downe he kept him with his scornefull sway,<br>
So as he could not weld him any way.<br>
The whiles that other villaine went about<br>
Him to haue bound, and thrald without delay;<br>
The whiles the foole did him reuile and flout,<br>
Threatning to yoke them tow &amp; tame their corage stout.<p>

As when a sturdy ploughman with his hynde<br>
By strength haue ouerthrowne a stubborne steare,<br>
They downe him hold, and fast with cords do bynde,<br>
Till they him force the buxome yoke to beare:<br>
So did these two this Knight oft tug and teare.<br>
Which when the Prince beheld, there standing by,<br>
He left his lofty steede to aide him neare,<br>
And buckling soone him selfe, gan fiercely fly<br>
Vppon that Carle, to saue his friend from ieopardy.<p>

The villaine leauing him vnto his mate<br>
To be captiu'd, and handled as he list,<br>
Himselfe addrest vnto this new debate,<br>
And with his club him all about so blist,<br>
That he which way to turne him scarcely wist:<br>
Sometimes aloft he layd, sometimes alow;<br>
Now here, now there, and oft him neare he mist;<br>
So doubtfully, that hardly one could know<br>
Whether more wary were to giue or ward the blow.<p>

But yet the Prince so well enured was<br>
With such huge strokes, approued oft in fight,<br>
That way to them he gaue forth right to pas.<br>
Ne would endure the daunger of their might,<br>
But wayt aduantage, when they downe did light.<br>
At last the caytiue after long discourse,<br>
When all his strokes he saw auoyded quite,<br>
Resolued in one t'assemble all his force,<br>
And make one end of him without ruth or remorse.<p>

His dreadfull hand he heaued vp aloft,<br>
And with his dreadfull instrument of yre,<br>
Thought sure haue pownded him to powder soft,<br>
Or deepe emboweld in the earth entyre:<br>
But Fortune did not with his will conspire.<br>
For ere his stroke attayned his intent,<br>
The noble childe preuenting his desire,<br>
Vnder his club with wary boldnesse went,<br>
And smote him on the knee, that neuer yet was bent.<p>

It neuer yet was bent, ne bent it now,<br>
Albe the stroke so strong and puissant were,<br>
That seem'd a marble pillour it could bow:<br>
But all that leg, which did his body beare,<br>
It crackt throughout, yet did no bloud appeare;<br>
So as it was vnable to support<br>
So huge a burden on such broken geare,<br>
But fell to ground, like to a lumpe of durt;<br>
Whence he assayd to rise, but could not for his hurt.<p>

Eftsoones the Prince to him full nimbly stept,<br>
And least he should recouer foote againe,<br>
His head meant from his shoulders to haue swept.<br>
Which when the Lady saw, she cryde amaine;<br>
Stay stay, Sir Knight, for loue of God abstaine,<br>
From that vnwares ye weetlesse doe intend;<br>
Slay not that Carle, though worthy to be slaine:<br>
For more on him doth then him selfe depend;<br>
My life will by his death haue lamentable end.<p>

He staide his hand according her desire,<br>
Yet nathemore him suffred to arize;<br>
But still suppressing gan of her inquire,<br>
What meaning mote those vncouth words comprize,<br>
That in that villaines health her safety lies:<br>
That, were no might in man, nor heart in Knights,<br>
Which durst her dreaded reskue enterprize,<br>
Yet heauens them selues, that fauour feeble rights,<br>
Would for it selfe redresse, and punish such despights.<p>

Then bursting forth in teares, which gushed fast<br>
Like many water streames, a while she stayd;<br>
Till the sharpe passion being ouerpast,<br>
Her tongue to her restord, then thus she sayd;<br>
Nor heauens, nor men can me most wretched mayd<br>
Deliuer from the doome of my desart,<br>
The which the God of loue hath on me layd,<br>
And damned to endure this direfull smart,<br>
For penaunce of my proud and hard rebellious hart.<p>

In prime of youthly yeares, when first the flowre<br>
Of beauty gan to bud, and bloosme delight,<br>
And nature me endu'd with plenteous dowre,<br>
Of all her gifts, that pleasde each liuing sight,<br>
I was belou'd of many a gentle Knight,<br>
And sude and sought with all the seruice dew:<br>
Full many a one for me deepe groand and sigh't,<br>
And to the dore of death for sorrow drew,<br>
Complayning out on me, that would not on them rew.<p>

But let them loue that list, or liue or die;<br>
Me list not die for any louers doole:<br>
Ne list me leaue my loued libertie,<br>
To pitty him that list to play the foole:<br>
To loue my selfe I learned had in schoole.<br>
Thus I triumphed long in louers paine,<br>
And sitting carelesse on the scorners stoole,<br>
Did laugh at those that did lament and plaine:<br>
But all is now repayd with interest againe.<p>

For loe the winged God, that woundeth harts,<br>
Causde me be called to accompt therefore,<br>
And for reuengement of those wrongfull smarts,<br>
Which I to others did inflict afore,<br>
Addeem'd me to endure this penaunce sore;<br>
That in this wize, and this vnmeete array,<br>
With these two lewd companions, and no more,<br>
<i>Disdaine</i> and <i>Scorne</i>, I through the world should stray,<br>
Till I haue sau'd so many, as I earst did slay.<p>

Certes (sayd then the Prince) the God is iust,<br>
That taketh vengeaunce of his peoples spoile.<br>
For were no law in loue, but all that lust,<br>
Might them oppresse, and painefully turmoile,<br>
His kingdome would continue but a while.<br>
But tell me Lady, wherefore doe you beare<br>
This bottle thus before you with such toile,<br>
And eeke this wallet at your backe arreare,<br>
That for these Carles to carry much more comely were?<p>

Here in this bottle (sayd the sory Mayd)<br>
I put the teares of my contrition,<br>
Till to the brim I haue it full defrayd:<br>
And in this bag which I behinde me don,<br>
I put repentaunce for things past and gon.<br>
Yet is the bottle leake, and bag so torne,<br>
That all which I put in, fals out anon;<br>
And is behinde me trodden downe of <i>Scorne</i>,<br>
Who mocketh all my paine, &amp; laughs the more I mourn.<p>

The Infant hearkned wisely to her tale,<br>
And wondred much at <i>Cupids</i> iudg'ment wise,<br>
That could so meekly make proud hearts auale,<br>
And wreake him selfe on them, that him despise.<br>
Then suffred he <i>Disdaine</i> vp to arise,<br>
Who was not able vp him selfe to reare,<br>
By meanes his leg through his late luckelesse prise,<br>
Was crackt in twaine, but by his foolish feere<br>
Was holpen vp, who him supported standing neare.<p>

But being vp, he lookt againe aloft,<br>
As if he neuer had receiued fall;<br>
And with sterne eye-browes stared at him oft,<br>
As if he would haue daunted him with all:<br>
And standing on his tiptoes, to seeme tall,<br>
Downe on his golden feete he often gazed,<br>
As if such pride the other could apall;<br>
Who was so far from being ought amazed,<br>
That he his lookes despised, and his boast dispraized.<p>

Then turning backe vnto that captiue thrall,<br>
Who all this while stood there beside them bound,<br>
Vnwilling to be knowne, or seene at all,<br>
He from those bands weend him to haue vnwound.<br>
But when approching neare, he plainely found,<br>
It was his owne true groome, the gentle Squire,<br>
He thereat wext exceedingly astound,<br>
And him did oft embrace, and oft admire,<br>
Ne could with seeing satisfie his great desire.<p>

Meane while the Saluage man, when he beheld<br>
That huge great foole oppressing th'other Knight,<br>
Whom with his weight vnweldy downe he held,<br>
He flew vpon him, like a greedy kight<br>
Vnto some carrion offered to his sight,<br>
And downe him plucking, with his nayles and teeth<br>
Gan him to hale, and teare, and scratch, and bite;<br>
And from him taking his owne whip, therewith<br>
So sore him scourgeth, that the bloud downe followeth.<p>

And sure I weene, had not the Ladies cry<br>
Procur'd the Prince his cruell hand to stay,<br>
He would with whipping, him haue done to dye:<br>
But being checkt, he did abstaine streight way,<br>
And let him rise. Then thus the Prince gan say;<br>
Now Lady sith your fortunes thus dispose,<br>
That if ye list haue liberty, ye may,<br>
Vnto your selfe I freely leaue to chose,<br>
Whether I shall you leaue, or from these villaines lose.<p>

Ah nay Sir Knight (sayd she) it may not be,<br>
But that I needes must by all meanes fulfill<br>
This penaunce, which enioyned is to me,<br>
Least vnto me betide a greater ill;<br>
Yet no lesse thankes to you for your good will.<br>
So humbly taking leaue, she turnd aside,<br>
But <i>Arthure</i> with the rest, went onward still<br>
On his first quest, in which did him betide<br>
A great aduenture, which did him from them deuide.<p>

But first it falleth me by course to tell<br>
Of faire <i>Serena</i>, who as earst you heard,<br>
When first the gentle Squire at variaunce fell<br>
With those two Carles, fled fast away, afeard<br>
Of villany to be to her inferd:<br>
So fresh the image of her former dread,<br>
Yet dwelling in her eye, to her appeard,<br>
That euery foote did tremble, which did tread,<br>
And euery body two, and two she foure did read.<p>

Through hils &amp; dales, through bushes &amp; through breres<br>
Long thus she fled, till that at last she thought<br>
Her selfe now past the perill of her feares.<br>
Then looking round about, and seeing nought,<br>
Which doubt of daunger to her offer mought,<br>
She from her palfrey lighted on the plaine,<br>
And sitting downe, her selfe a while bethought<br>
Of her long trauell and turmoyling paine;<br>
And often did of loue, and oft of lucke complaine.<p>

And euermore she blamed <i>Calepine</i>,<br>
The good Sir <i>Calepine</i>, her owne true Knight,<br>
As th'onely author of her wofull tine:<br>
For being of his loue to her so light,<br>
As her to leaue in such a piteous plight.<br>
Yet neuer Turtle truer to his make,<br>
Then he was tride vnto his Lady bright:<br>
Who all this while endured for her sake,<br>
Great perill of his life, and restlesse paines did take.<p>

Tho when as all her plaints she had displayd,<br>
And well disburdened her engrieued brest,<br>
Vpon the grasse her selfe adowne she layd;<br>
Where being tyrde with trauell, and opprest<br>
With sorrow, she betooke her selfe to rest.<br>
There whilest in <i>Morpheus</i> bosome safe she lay,<br>
Fearelesse of ought, that mote her peace molest,<br>
False Fortune did her safety betray,<br>
Vnto a straunge mischaunce, that menac'd her decay.<p>

In these wylde deserts, where she now abode,<br>
There dwelt a saluage nation, which did liue<br>
Of stealth and spoile, and making nightly rode<br>
Into their neighbours borders; ne did giue<br>
Them selues to any trade, as for to driue<br>
The painefull plough, or cattell for to breed,<br>
Or by aduentrous marchandize to thriue;<br>
But on the labours of poore men to feed,<br>
And serue their owne necessities with others need.<p>

Thereto they vsde one most accursed order,<br>
To eate the flesh of men, whom they mote fynde,<br>
And straungers to deuoure, which on their border<br>
Were brought by errour, or by wreckfull wynde.<br>
A monstrous cruelty gainst course of kynde.<br>
They towards euening wandring euery way,<br>
To seeke for booty, came by fortune blynde,<br>
Whereas this Lady, like a sheepe astray,<br>
Now drowned in the depth of sleepe all fearelesse lay.<p>

Soone as they spide her, Lord what gladfull glee<br>
They made amongst them selues; but when her face<br>
Like the faire yuory shining they did see,<br>
Each gan his fellow solace and embrace,<br>
For ioy of such good hap by heauenly grace.<br>
Then gan they to deuize what course to take:<br>
Whether to slay her there vpon the place,<br>
Or suffer her out of her sleepe to wake,<br>
And then her eate attonce; or many meales to make.<p>

The best aduizement was of bad, to let her<br>
Sleepe out her fill, without encomberment:<br>
For sleepe they sayd would make her battill better.<br>
Then when she wakt, they all gaue one consent,<br>
That since by grace of God she there was sent,<br>
Vnto their God they would her sacrifize,<br>
Whose share, her guiltlesse bloud they would present,<br>
But of her dainty flesh they did deuize<br>
To make a common feast, &amp; feed with gurmandize.<p>

So round about her they them selues did place<br>
Vpon the grasse, and diuersely dispose,<br>
As each thought best to spend the lingring space.<br>
Some with their eyes the daintest morsels chose;<br>
Some praise her paps, some praise her lips and nose;<br>
Some whet their kniues, and strip their elboes bare:<br>
The Priest him selfe a garland doth compose<br>
Of finest flowres, and with full busie care<br>
His bloudy vessels wash, and holy fire prepare.<p>

The Damzell wakes, then all attonce vpstart,<br>
And round about her flocke, like many flies,<br>
Whooping, and hallowing on euery part,<br>
As if they would haue rent the brasen skies.<br>
Which when she sees with ghastly griefful eies,<br>
Her heart does quake, and deadly pallid hew<br>
Benumbes her cheekes: Then out aloud she cries,<br>
Where none is nigh to heare, that will her rew,<br>
And rends her golden locks, and snowy brests embrew.<p>

But all bootes not: they hands vpon her lay;<br>
And first they spoile her of her iewels deare,<br>
And afterwards of all her rich array;<br>
The which amongst them they in peeces teare,<br>
And of the pray each one a part doth beare.<br>
Now being naked, to their sordid eyes<br>
The goodly threasures of nature appeare:<br>
Which as they view with lustfull fantasyes,<br>
Each wisheth to him selfe, and to the rest enuyes.<p>

Her yuorie necke, her alablaster brest,<br>
Her paps, which like white silken pillowes were,<br>
For loue in soft delight thereon to rest;<br>
Her tender sides, her bellie white and clere,<br>
Which like an Altar did it selfe vprere,<br>
To offer sacrifice diuine thereon;<br>
Her goodly thighes, whose glorie did appeare<br>
Like a triumphall Arch, and thereupon<br>
The spoiles of Princes hang'd, which were in battel won.<p>

Those daintie parts, the dearlings of delight,<br>
Which mote not be prophan'd of common eyes,<br>
Those villeins vew'd with loose lasciuious sight,<br>
And closely tempted with their craftie spyes;<br>
And some of them gan mongst themselues deuize,<br>
Thereof by force to take their beastly pleasure.<br>
But them the Priest rebuking, did aduize<br>
To dare not to pollute so sacred threasure,<br>
Vow'd to the gods: religi&otilde; held euen theeues in measure.<p>

So being stayd, they her from thence directed<br>
Vnto a litle groue not farre asyde,<br>
In which an altar shortly they erected,<br>
To slay her on. And now the Euentyde<br>
His brode black wings had through the heauens wyde<br>
By this dispred, that was the tyme ordayned<br>
For such a dismall deed, their guilt to hyde:<br>
Of few greene turfes an altar soone they fayned,<br>
And deckt it all with flowres, which they nigh hand obtayned.<p>

Tho when as all things readie were aright,<br>
The Damzell was before the altar set,<br>
Being alreadie dead with fearefull fright.<br>
To whom the Priest with naked armes full net<br>
Approching nigh, and murdrous knife well whet,<br>
Gan mutter close a certaine secret charme,<br>
With other diuelish ceremonies met:<br>
Which doen he gan aloft t'aduance his arme,<br>
Whereat they shouted all, and made a loud alarme.<p>

Then gan the bagpypes and the hornes to shrill,<br>
And shrieke aloud, that with the peoples voyce<br>
Confused, did the ayre with terror fill,<br>
And made the wood to tremble at the noyce:<br>
The whyles she wayld, the more they did reioyce.<br>
Now mote ye vnderstand that to this groue<br>
Sir <i>Calepine</i> by chaunce, more then by choyce,<br>
The selfe same euening fortune hether droue,<br>
As he to seeke <i>Serena</i> through the woods did roue.<p>

Long had he sought her, and through many a soyle<br>
Had traueld still on foot in heauie armes,<br>
Ne ought was tyred with his endlesse toyles,<br>
Ne ought was feared of his certaine harmes:<br>
And now all weetlesse of the wretched stormes,<br>
In which his loue was lost, he slept full fast,<br>
Till being waked with these loud alarmes,<br>
He lightly started vp like one aghast,<br>
And catching vp his arms streight to the noise forth past.<p>

There by th'vncertaine glimse of starry night,<br>
And by the twinkling of their sacred fire,<br>
He mote perceiue a litle dawning sight<br>
Of all, which there was doing in that quire:<br>
Mongst whom a woman spoyld of all attire<br>
He spyde, lamenting her vnluckie strife,<br>
And groning sore from grieued hart entire,<br>
Eftsoones he saw one with a naked knife<br>
Readie to launce her brest, and let out loued life.<p>

With that he thrusts into the thickest throng,<br>
And euen as his right hand adowne descends,<br>
He him preuenting, layes on earth along,<br>
And sacrifizeth to th'infernall feends.<br>
Then to the rest his wrathfull hand he bends,<br>
Of whom he makes such hauocke and such hew,<br>
That swarmes of damned soules to hell he sends:<br>
The rest that scape his sword and death eschew,<br>
Fly like a flocke of doues before a Faulcons vew.<p>

From them returning to that Ladie backe,<br>
Whom by the Altar he doth sitting find,<br>
Yet fearing death, and next to death the lacke<br>
Of clothes to couer, what they ought by kind:<br>
He first her hands beginneth to vnbind,<br>
And then to question of her present woe;<br>
And afterwards to cheare with speaches kind.<br>
But she for nought that he could say or doe,<br>
One word durst speake, or answere him a whit thereto.<p>

So inward shame of her vncomely case<br>
She did conceiue, through care of womanhood,<br>
That though the night did couer her disgrace,<br>
Yet she in so vnwomanly a mood,<br>
Would not bewray the state in which she stood.<br>
So all that night to him vnknowen she past.<br>
But day, that doth discouer bad and good,<br>
Ensewing, made her knowen to him at last:<br>
The end whereof Ile keepe vntill another cast.<p>
