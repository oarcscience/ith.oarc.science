<blockquote> 
<i>The enimies of Temperaunce<br>
besiege her dwelling place:<br>
Prince Arthur them repelles, and fowle<br>
Maleger doth deface.</i><p>
</blockquote> 

 
<p>
<blockquote> 
W
Hat warre so cruell, or what siege so sore,<br>
As that, which strong affections do apply<br>
Against the fort of reason euermore<br>
Bring the soule into captiuitie:<br>
Their force is fiercer through infirmitie<br>
Of the fraile flesh, relenting to their rage,<br>
And exercise most bitter tyranny<br>
Vpon the parts, brought into their bondage:<br>
No wretchednesse is like to sinfull vellenage.<p>
 
But in a body, which doth freely yeeld<br>
His partes to reasons rule obedient,<br>
And letteth her that ought the scepter weeld,<br>
All happy peace and goodly gouernment<br>
Is setled there in sure establishment;<br>
There <i>Alma</i> like a virgin Queene most bright,<br>
Doth florish in all beautie excellent:<br>
And to her guestes doth bounteous banket dight,<br>
Attempred goodly well for health and for delight.<p>
 
Early before the Morne with cremosin ray,<br>
The windowes of bright heauen opened had,<br>
Through which into the world the dawning day<br>
Might looke, that maketh euery creature glad,<br>
Vprose Sir <i>Guyon</i>, in bright armour clad,<br>
And to his purposd iourney him prepar'd:<br>
With him the Palmer eke in habit sad,<br>
Him selfe addrest to that aduenture hard:<br>
So to the riuers side they both together far'd.<p>
 
Where them awaited ready at the ford<br>
The <i>Ferriman</i>, as <i>Alma</i> had behight,<br>
With his well rigged boate: They go abord,<br>
And he eftsoones gan launch his barke forthright.<br>
Ere long they rowed were quite out of sight,<br>
And fast the land behind them fled away.<br>
But let them pas, whiles wind and weather right<br>
Do serue their turnes: here I a while must stay,<br>
To see a cruell fight doen by the Prince this day.<p>
 
For all so soone, as <i>Guyon</i> thence was gon<br>
Vpon his voyage with his trustie guide,<br>
That wicked band of villeins fresh begon<br>
That castle to assaile on euery side,<br>
And lay strong siege about it far and wide.<br>
So huge and infinite their numbers were,<br>
That all the land they vnder them did hide;<br>
So fowle and vgly, that exceeding feare<br>
Their visages imprest, when they approched neare.<p>
 
Them in twelue troupes their Captain did dispart<br>
And round about in fittest steades did place,<br>
Where each might best offend his proper part,<br>
And his contrary obiect most deface,<br>
As euery one seem'd meetest in that cace.<br>
Seuen of the same against the Castle gate,<br>
In strong entrenchments he did closely place,<br>
Which with incessaunt force and endlesse hate,<br>
They battred day and night, and entraunce did awate.<p>
 
The other fiue, fiue sundry wayes he set,<br>
Against the fiue great Bulwarkes of that pile,<br>
And vnto each a Bulwarke did arret,<br>
T'assayle with open force or hidden guile,<br>
In hope thereof to win victorious spoile.<br>
They all that charge did feruently apply,<br>
With greedie malice and importune toyle,<br>
And planted there their huge artillery,<br>
With which they dayly made most dreadfull battery.<p>
 
The first troupe was a monstrous rablement<br>
Of fowle misshapen wights, of which some were<br>
Headed like Owles, with beckes vncomely bent,<br>
Others like Dogs, others like Gryphons dreare,<br>
And some had wings, and some had clawes to teare,<br>
And euery one of them had Lynces eyes,<br>
And euery one did bow and arrowes beare:<br>
All those were lawlesse lustes, corrupt enuies,<br>
And couetous aspectes, all cruell enimies.<p>
 
Those same against the bulwarke of the <i>Sight</i><br>
Did lay strong siege, and battailous assault,<br>
Ne once did yield it respit day nor night,<br>
But soone as <i>Titan</i> gan his head exault,<br>
And soone againe as he his light withhault,<br>
Their wicked engins they against it bent:<br>
That is each thing, by which the eyes may fault:<br>
But two then all more huge and violent,<br>
Beautie, and money, they that Bulwarke sorely rent.<p>
 
The second Bulwarke was the <i>Hearing</i> sence,<br>
Gainst which the second troupe dessignment makes;<br>
Deformed creatures, in straunge difference,<br>
Some hauing heads like Harts, some like to Snakes,<br>
Some like wild Bores late rouzd out of the brakes;<br>
Slaunderous reproches, and fowle infamies,<br>
Leasings, backbytings, and vaine-glorious crakes,<br>
Bad counsels, prayses, and false flatteries.<br>
All those against that fort did bend their batteries.<p>
 
Likewise that same third Fort, that is the <i>Smell</i><br>
Of that third troupe was cruelly assayd:<br>
Whose hideous shapes were like to feends of hell,<br>
Some like to hounds, some like to Apes, dismayd,<br>
Some like to Puttockes, all in plumes arayd:<br>
All shap't according their conditions,<br>
For by those vgly formes weren pourtrayd,<br>
Foolish delights and fond abusions,<br>
Which do that sence besiege with light illusions.<p>
 
And that fourth band, which cruell battry bent,<br>
Against the fourth Bulwarke, that is the <i>Tast</i>,<br>
Was as the rest, a grysie rablement,<br>
Some mouth'd like greedy Oystriges, some fast<br>
Like loathly Toades, some fashioned in the wast<br>
Like swine; for so deformd is luxury,<br>
Surfeat, misdiet, and vnthriftie wast,<br>
Vaine feasts, and idle superfluity:<br>
All those this sences Fort assayle incessantly.<p>
 
But the fift troupe most horrible of hew,<br>
And fierce of force, was dreadfull to report:<br>
For some like Snailes, some did like spyders shew,<br>
And some like vgly Vrchins thicke and short:<br>
Cruelly they assayled that fift Fort,<br>
Armed with darts of sensuall delight,<br>
With stings of carnall lust, and strong effort<br>
Of feeling pleasures, with which day and night<br>
Against that same fift bulwarke they continued fight.<p>
 
Thus these twelue troupes with dreadfull puissance<br>
Against that Castle restlesse siege did lay,<br>
And euermore their hideous Ordinance<br>
Vpon the Bulwarkes cruelly did play,<br>
That now it gan to threaten neare decay:<br>
And euermore their wicked Capitaine<br>
Prouoked them the breaches to assay,<br>
Somtimes with threats, somtimes with hope of gaine,<br>
Which by the ransack of that peece they should attaine.<p>
 
On th'other side, th'assieged Castles ward<br>
Their stedfast stonds did mightily maintaine,<br>
And many bold repulse, and many hard<br>
Atchieuement wrought with perill and with paine,<br>
That goodly frame from ruine to sustaine:<br>
And those two brethren Giants did defend<br>
The walles so stoutly with their sturdie maine,<br>
That neuer entrance any durst pretend,<br>
But they to direfull death their groning ghosts did send.<p>
 
The noble virgin, Ladie of the place,<br>
Was much dismayed with that dreadfull sight:<br>
For neuer was she in so euill cace,<br>
Till that the Prince seeing her wofull plight,<br>
Gan her recomfort from so sad affright,<br>
Offring his seruice, and his dearest life<br>
For her defence, against that Carle to fight,<br>
Which was their chiefe and th'author of that strife:<br>
She him remercied as the Patrone of her life.<p>
 
Eftsoones himselfe in glitterand armes he dight,<br>
And his well proued weapons to him hent;<br>
So taking courteous conge he behight,<br>
Those gates to be vnbar'd, and forth he went.<br>
Faire mote he thee, the prowest and most gent,<br>
That euer brandished bright steele on hye:<br>
Whom soone as that vnruly rablement,<br>
With his gay Squire issuing did espy,<br>
They reard a most outrageous dreadfull yelling cry,<p>
 
And therewith all attonce at him let fly<br>
Their fluttring arrowes, thicke as flakes of snow,<br>
And round about him flocke impetuously,<br>
Like a great water flood, that tombling low<br>
From the high mountaines, threats to ouerflow<br>
With suddein fury all the fertile plaine,<br>
And the sad husbandmans long hope doth throw<br>
A downe the streame, and all his vowes make vaine,<br>
Nor bounds nor banks his headlong ruine may sustaine.<p>
 
Vpon his shield their heaped hayle he bore,<br>
And with his sword disperst the raskall flockes,<br>
Which fled a sunder, and him fell before,<br>
As withered leaues drop from their dried stockes,<br>
Wh&#7869; the wroth Western wind does reaue their locks;<br>
And vnder neath him his courageous steed,<br>
The fierce <i>Spumador</i> trode them downe like docks,<br>
The fierce <i>Spumador</i> borne of heauenly seed:<br>
Such as <i>Laomedon</i> of <i>Phoebus</i> race did breed.<p>
 
Which suddeine horrour and confused cry,<br>
When as their Captaine heard, in haste he yode,<br>
The cause to weet, and fault to remedy;<br>
Vpon a Tygre swift and fierce he rode,<br>
That as the winde ran vnderneath his lode,<br>
Whiles his long legs nigh raught vnto the ground;<br>
Full large he was of limbe, and shoulders brode,<br>
But of such subtile substance and vnsound,<br>
That like a ghost he seem'd, whose graue-clothes were vnbound.<p>
 
And in his hand a bended bow was seene,<br>
And many arrowes vnder his right side,<br>
All deadly daungerous, all cruell keene,<br>
Headed with flint, and feathers bloudie dide,<br>
Such as the <i>Indians</i> in their quiuers hide;<br>
Those could he well direct and streight as line,<br>
And bid them strike the marke, which he had eyde,<br>
Ne was their salue, ne was their medicine,<br>
That mote recure their wounds: so inly they did tine.<p>
 
As pale and wan as ashes was his looke,<br>
His bodie leane and meagre as a rake,<br>
And skin all withered like a dryed rooke,<br>
Thereto as cold and drery as a Snake,<br>
That seem'd to tremble euermore, and quake:<br>
All in a canuas thin he was bedight,<br>
And girded with a belt of twisted brake,<br>
Vpon his head he wore an Helmet light,<br>
Made of a dead mans skull, that seem'd a ghastly sight.<p>
 
<i>Maleger</i> was his name, and after him,<br>
There follow'd fast at hand two wicked Hags,<br>
With hoarie lockes all loose, and visage grim;<br>
Their feet vnshod, their bodies wrapt in rags,<br>
And both as swift on foot, as chased Stags;<br>
And yet the one her other legge had lame,<br>
Which with a staffe, all full of litle snags<br>
She did support, and <i>Impotence</i> her name:<br>
But th'other was <i>Impatience</i>, arm'd with raging flame.<p>
 
Soone as the Carle from farre the Prince espyde,<br>
Glistring in armes and warlike ornament,<br>
His Beast he felly prickt on either syde,<br>
And his mischieuous bow full readie bent,<br>
With which at him a cruell shaft he sent:<br>
But he was warie, and it warded well<br>
Vpon his shield, that it no further went,<br>
But to the ground the idle quarrell fell:<br>
Then he another and another did expell.<p>
 
Which to preuent, the Prince his mortall speare<br>
Soone to him raught, and fierce at him did ride,<br>
To be auenged of that shot whyleare:<br>
But he was not so hardie to abide<br>
That bitter stownd, but turning quicke aside<br>
His light-foot beast, fled fast away for feare:<br>
Whom to pursue, the Infant after hide,<br>
So fast as his good Courser could him beare,<br>
But labour lost it was, to weene approch him neare.<p>
 
For as the winged wind his Tigre fled,<br>
That vew of eye could scarse him ouertake,<br>
Ne scarse his feet on ground were seene to tred;<br>
Through hils and dales he speedie way did make,<br>
Ne hedge ne ditch his readie passage brake,<br>
And in his flight the villein turn'd his face,<br>
(As wonts the <i>Tartar</i> by the <i>Caspian</i> lake,<br>
When as the <i>Russian</i> him in fight does chace)<br>
Vnto his Tygres taile, and shot at him apace.<p>
 
Apace he shot, and yet he fled apace,<br>
Still as the greedy knight nigh to him drew,<br>
And oftentimes he would relent his pace,<br>
That him his foe more fiercely should pursew:<br>
Who when his vncouth manner he did vew,<br>
He gan auize to follow him no more,<br>
But keepe his standing, and his shaftes eschew,<br>
Vntill he quite had spent his perlous store,<br>
And then assayle him fresh, ere he could shift for more.<p>
 
But that lame Hag, still as abroad he strew<br>
His wicked arrowes, gathered them againe,<br>
And to him brought, fresh battell to renew:<br>
Which he espying, cast her to restraine<br>
From yielding succour to that cursed Swaine,<br>
And her attaching, thought her hands to tye;<br>
But soone as him dismounted on the plaine,<br>
That other Hag did farre away espy<br>
Binding her sister, she to him ran hastily.<p>
 
And catching hold of him, as downe he lent,<br>
Him backward ouerthrew, and downe him stayd<br>
With their rude hands and griesly graplement,<br>
Till that the villein comming to their ayd,<br>
Vpon him fell, and lode vpon him layd;<br>
Full litle wanted, but he had him slaine,<br>
And of the battell balefull end had made,<br>
Had not his gentle Squire beheld his paine,<br>
And commen to his reskew, ere his bitter bane.<p>
 
So greatest and most glorious thing on ground<br>
May often need the helpe of weaker hand;<br>
So feeble is mans state, and life vnsound,<br>
That in assurance it may neuer stand,<br>
Till it dissolued be from earthly band.<br>
Proofe be thou Prince, the prowest man aliue,<br>
And noblest borne of all in <i>Britayne</i> land;<br>
Yet thee fierce Fortune did so nearely driue,<br>
That had not grace thee blest, thou shouldest not suruiue.<p>
 
The Squire arriuing, fiercely in his armes<br>
Snatcht first the one, and then the other Iade,<br>
His chiefest lets and authors of his harmes,<br>
And them perforce withheld with threatned blade,<br>
Least that his Lord they should behind inuade;<br>
The whiles the Prince prickt with reprochfull shame,<br>
As one awakt out of long slombring shade,<br>
Reuiuing thought of glorie and of fame,<br>
Vnited all his powres to purge himselfe from blame.<p>
 
Like as a fire, the which in hollow caue<br>
Hath long bene vnderkept, and downe supprest,<br>
With murmurous disdaine doth inly raue,<br>
And grudge, in so streight prison to be prest,<br>
At last breakes forth with furious vnrest,<br>
And striues to mount vnto his natiue seat;<br>
All that did earst it hinder and molest,<br>
It now deuoures with flames and scorching heat,<br>
And carries into smoake with rage and horror great.<p>
 
So mightily the <i>Briton</i> Prince him rouzd<br>
Out of his hold, and broke his caitiue bands,<br>
And as a Beare whom angry curres haue touzd,<br>
Hauing off-shakt them, and escapt their hands,<br>
Becomes more fell, and all that him withstands<br>
Treads downe and ouerthrowes. Now had the Carle<br>
Alighted from his Tigre, and his hands<br>
Discharged of his bow and deadly quar'le,<br>
To seize vpon his foe flat lying on the marle.<p>
 
Which now him turnd to disauantage deare;<br>
For neither can he fly, nor other harme,<br>
But trust vnto his strength and manhood meare,<br>
Sith now he is farre from his monstrous swarme,<br>
And of his weapons did himselfe disarme.<br>
The knight yet wrothfull for his late disgrace,<br>
Fiercely aduaunst his valorous right arme,<br>
And him so sore smote with his yron mace,<br>
That groueling to the ground he fell, and fild his place.<p>
 
Well weened he, that field was then his owne,<br>
And all his labour brought to happie end,<br>
When suddein vp the villein ouerthrowne,<br>
Out of his swowne arose, fresh to contend,<br>
And gan himselfe to second battell bend,<br>
As hurt he had not bene.  Thereby there lay<br>
An huge great stone, which stood vpon one end,<br>
And had not bene remoued many a day;<br>
Some land-marke seem'd to be, or signe of sundry way.<p>
 
The same he snatcht, and with exceeding sway<br>
Threw at his foe, who was right well aware<br>
To shunne the engin of his meant decay;<br>
It booted not to thinke that throw to beare,<br>
But ground he gaue, and lightly leapt areare:<br>
Eft fierce returning, as a Faulcon faire<br>
That once hath failed of her souse full neare,<br>
Remounts againe into the open aire,<br>
And vnto better fortune doth her selfe prepaire.<p>
 
So braue returning, with his brandisht blade,<br>
He to the Carle himselfe againe addrest,<br>
And strooke at him so sternely, that he made<br>
An open passage through his riuen brest,<br>
That halfe the steele behind his back did rest;<br>
Which drawing backe, he looked euermore<br>
When the hart bloud should gush out of his chest,<br>
Or his dead corse should fall vpon the flore;<br>
But his dead corse vpon the flore fell nathemore.<p>
 
Ne drop of bloud appeared shed to bee,<br>
All were the wounde so wide and wonderous,<br>
That through his carkasse one might plainely see:<br>
Halfe in a maze with horror hideous,<br>
And halfe in rage, to be deluded thus,<br>
Againe through both the sides he strooke him quight,<br>
That made his spright to grone full piteous:<br>
Yet nathemore forth fled his groning spright,<br>
But freshly as at first, prepard himselfe to fight.<p>
 
Thereat he smitten was with great affright,<br>
And trembling terror did his hart apall,<br>
Ne wist he, what to thinke of that same sight,<br>
Ne what to say, ne what to doe at all;<br>
He doubted, least it were some magicall<br>
Illusion, that did beguile his sense,<br>
Or wandring ghost, that wanted funerall,<br>
Or aerie spirit vnder false pretence,<br>
Or hellish feend raysd vp through diuelish science.<p>
 
His wonder farre exceeded reasons reach,<br>
That he began to doubt his dazeled sight,<br>
And oft of error did himselfe appeach:<br>
Flesh without bloud, a person without spright,<br>
Wounds without hurt, a bodie without might,<br>
That could doe harme, yet could not harmed bee,<br>
That could not die, yet seem'd a mortall wight,<br>
That was most strong in most infirmitee;<br>
Like did he neuer heare, like did he neuer see.<p>
 
A while he stood in this astonishment,<br>
Yet would he not for all his great dismay<br>
Giue ouer to effect his first intent,<br>
And th'vtmost meanes of victorie assay,<br>
Or th'vtmost issew of his owne decay.<br>
His owne good sword <i>Morddure</i>, that neuer fayld<br>
At need, till now, he lightly threw away,<br>
And his bright shield, that nought him now auayld,<br>
And with his naked hands him forcibly assayld.<p>
 
Twixt his two mightie armes him vp he snatcht,<br>
And crusht his carkasse so against his brest,<br>
That the disdainfull soule he thence dispatcht,<br>
And th'idle breath all vtterly exprest:<br>
Tho when he felt him dead, a downe he kest<br>
The lumpish corse vnto the senselesse grownd;<br>
Adowne he kest it with so puissant wrest,<br>
That backe againe it did aloft rebownd,<br>
And gaue against his mother earth a gronefull sownd.<p>
 
As when <i>Ioues</i> harnesse-bearing Bird from hie<br>
Stoupes at a flying heron with proud disdaine,<br>
The stone-dead quarrey fals so forciblie,<br>
That it rebounds against the lowly plaine,<br>
A second fall redoubling backe againe.<br>
Then thought the Prince all perill sure was past,<br>
And that he victor onely did remaine;<br>
No sooner thought, then that the Carle as fast<br>
Gan heap huge strokes on him, as ere he downe was cast.<p>
 
Nigh his wits end then woxe th'amazed knight,<br>
And thought his labour lost and trauell vaine,<br>
Against this lifelesse shadow so to fight:<br>
Yet life he saw, and felt his mightie maine,<br>
That whiles he marueild still, did still him paine:<br>
For thy he gan some other wayes aduize,<br>
How to take life from that dead-liuing swaine,<br>
Whom still he marked freshly to arize<br>
From th'earth, &amp; from her wombe new spirits to reprize.<p>
 
He then remembred well, that had bene sayd,<br>
How th'Earth his mother was, and first him bore;<br>
She eke so often, as his life decayd,<br>
Did life with vsury to him restore,<br>
And raysd him vp much stronger then before,<br>
So soone as he vnto her wombe did fall;<br>
Therefore to ground he would him cast no more,<br>
Ne him commit to graue terrestriall,<br>
But beare him farre from hope of succour vsuall.<p>
 
Tho vp he caught him twixt his puissant hands,<br>
And hauing scruzd out of his carrion corse<br>
The lothfull life, now loosd from sinfull bands,<br>
Vpon his shoulders carried him perforse<br>
Aboue three furlongs, taking his full course,<br>
Vntill he came vnto a standing lake;<br>
Him thereinto he threw without remorse,<br>
Ne stird, till hope of life did him forsake;<br>
So end of that Carles dayes, and his owne paines did make.<p>
 
Which when those wicked Hags from farre did spy,<br>
Like two mad dogs they ran about the lands,<br>
And th'one of them with dreadfull yelling cry,<br>
Throwing away her broken chaines and bands,<br>
And hauing quencht her burning fier brands,<br>
Hedlong her selfe did cast into that lake;<br>
But <i>Impotence</i> with her owne wilfull hands,<br>
One of <i>Malegers</i> cursed darts did take,<br>
So riu'd her trembling hart, and wicked end did make.<p>
 
Thus now alone he conquerour remaines;<br>
Tho comming to his Squire, that kept his steed,<br>
Thought to haue mounted, but his feeble vaines<br>
Him faild thereto, and serued not his need,<br>
Through losse of bloud, which from his wounds did bleed,<br>
That he began to faint, and life decay:<br>
But his good Squire him helping vp with speed,<br>
With stedfast hand vpon his horse did stay,<br>
And led him to the Castle by the beaten way.<p>
 
Where many Groomes and Squiers readie were,<br>
To take him from his steed full tenderly,<br>
And eke the fairest <i>Alma</i> met him there<br>
With balme and wine and costly spicery,<br>
To comfort him in his infirmity;<br>
Eftsoones she causd him vp to be conuayd,<br>
And of his armes despoyled easily,<br>
In sumptuous bed she made him to be layd,<br>
And all the while his wounds were dressing, by him stayd.<p>
