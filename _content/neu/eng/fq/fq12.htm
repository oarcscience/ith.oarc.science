<blockquote> 
 
 
<i>Faire Vna to the Redcrosse knight<br> 
betrouthed is with ioy:<br>  
Though false Duessa it to barre<br>  
her false sleights doe imploy. </i><p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>
<blockquote>     
BEhold I see the hauen nigh at hand,<br>
To which I meane my wearie course to bend;<br>
Vere the maine shete, and beare vp with the land,<br>
The which afore is fairely to be kend,<br>
And seemeth safe from stormes, that may offend;<br>
There this faire virgin wearie of her way<br>
Must landed be, now at her iourneyes end:<br>
There eke my feeble barke a while may stay,<br>
Till merry wind and weather call her thence away.<p>
 
Scarsely had <i>Phoebus</i> in the glooming East<br>
Yet harnessed his firie-footed teeme,<br>
Ne reard aboue the earth his flaming creast,<br>
When the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme,<br>
That signe of last outbreathed life did seeme,<br>
Vnto the watchman on the castle wall;<br>
Who thereby dead that balefull Beast did deeme,<br>
And to his Lord and Ladie lowd gan call,<br>
To tell, how he had seene the Dragons fatall fall.<p>
 
Vprose with hastie ioy, and feeble speed<br>
That aged Sire, the Lord of all that land,<br>
And looked forth, to weet, if true indeede<br>
Those tydings were, as he did vnderstand,<br>
Which whenas true by tryall he out fond,<br>
He bad to open wyde his brazen gate,<br>
Which long time had bene shut, and out of hond<br>
Proclaymed ioy and peace through all his state;<br>
For dead now was their foe, which them forrayed late.<p>
 
Then gan triumphant Trompets sound on hie,<br>
That sent to heauen the ecchoed report<br>
Of their new ioy, and happie victorie<br>
Gainst him, that had them long opprest with tort,<br>
And fast imprisoned in sieged fort.<br>
Then all the people, as in solemne feast,<br>
To him assembled with one full consort,<br>
Reioycing at the fall of that great beast,<br>
From whose eternall bondage now they were releast.<p>
 
Forth came that auncient Lord and aged Queene,<br>
Arayd in antique robes downe to the ground,<br>
And sad habiliments right well beseene;<br>
A noble crew about them waited round<br>
Of sage and sober Peres, all grauely gownd;<br>
Whom farre before did march a goodly band<br>
Of tall young men, all hable armes to sownd,<br>
But now they laurell braunches bore in hand;<br>
Glad signe of victorie and peace in all their land.<p>
 
Vnto that doughtie Conquerour they came,<br>
And him before themselues prostrating low,<br>
Their Lord and Patrone loud did him proclame,<br>
And at his feet their laurell boughes did throw.<br>
Soone after them all dauncing on a row<br>
The comely virgins came, with girlands dight,<br>
As fresh as flowres in medow greene do grow,<br>
When morning deaw vpon their leaues doth light:<br>
And in their hands sweet Timbrels all vpheld on hight.<p>
 
And them before, the fry of children young<br>
Their wanton sports and childish mirth did play,<br>
And to the Maydens sounding tymbrels sung<br>
In well attuned notes, a ioyous lay,<br>
And made delightfull musicke all the way,<br>
Vntill they came, where that faire virgin stood;<br>
As faire <i>Diana</i> in fresh sommers day<br>
Beholds her Nymphes, enraung'd in shadie wood,<br>
Some wrestle, some do run, some bathe in christall flood.<p>
 
So she beheld those maydens meriment<br>
With chearefull vew; who when to her they came,<br>
Themselues to ground with gratious humblesse bent,<br>
And her ador'd by honorable name,<br>
Lifting to heauen her euerlasting fame:<br>
Then on her head they set a girland greene,<br>
And crowned her twixt earnest and twixt game;<br>
Who in her selfe-resemblance well beseene,<br>
Did seeme such, as she was, a goodly maiden Queene.<p>
 
And after, all the raskall many ran,<br>
Heaped together in rude rablement<br>
To see the face of that victorious man:<br>
Whom all admired, as from heauen sent,<br>
And gazd vpon with gaping wonderment.<br>
But when they came, where that dead Dragon lay,<br>
Stretcht on the ground in monstrous large extent,<br>
The sight with idle feare did them dismay,<br>
Ne durst approch him nigh, to touch, or once assay.<p>
 
Some feard, and fled; some feard and well it faynd;<br>
One that would wiser seeme, then all the rest,<br>
Warnd him not touch, for yet perhaps remaynd<br>
Some lingring life within his hollow brest,<br>
Or in his wombe might lurke some hidden nest<br>
Of many Dragonets, his fruitfull seed;<br>
Another said, that in his eyes did rest<br>
Yet sparckling fire, and bad thereof take heed;<br>
Another said, he saw him moue his eyes indeed.<p>
 
One mother, when as her foolehardie chyld<br>
Did come too neare, and with his talants play,<br>
Halfe dead through feare, her litle babe reuyld,<br>
And to her gossips gan in counsell say;<br>
How can I tell, but that his talants may<br>
Yet scratch my sonne, or rend his tender hand?<br>
So diuersly themselues in vaine they fray;<br>
Whiles some more bold, to measure him nigh stand,<br>
To proue how many acres he did spread of land.<p>
 
Thus flocked all the folke him round about,<br>
The whiles that hoarie king, with all his traine,<br>
Being arriued, where that champion stout<br>
After his foes defeasance did remaine,<br>
Him goodly greetes, and faire does entertaine,<br>
With princely gifts of yuorie and gold,<br>
And thousand thankes him yeelds for all his paine.<br>
Then when his daughter deare he does behold,<br>
Her dearely doth imbrace, and kisseth manifold.<p>
 
And after to his Pallace he them brings,<br>
With shaumes, &amp; trompets, &amp with Clarions sweet;<br>
And all the way the ioyous people sings,<br>
And with their garments strowes the paued street:<br>
Whence mounting vp, they find purueyance meet<br>
Of all, that royall Princes court became,<br>
And all the floore was vnderneath their feet<br>
Bespred with costly scarlot of great name,<br>
On which they lowly sit, and fitting purpose frame.<p>
 
What needs me tell their feast and goodly guize,<br>
In which was nothing riotous nor vaine?<br>
What needs of daintie dishes to deuize,<br>
Of comely seruices, or courtly trayne?<br>
My narrow leaues cannot in them containe<br>
The large discourse of royall Princes state.<br>
Yet was their manner then but bare and plaine:<br>
For th'antique world excesse and pride did hate;<br>
Such proud luxurious pompe is swollen vp but late.<p>
 
Then when with meates and drinkes of euery kinde<br>
Their feruent appetites they quenched had,<br>
That auncient Lord gan fit occasion finde,<br>
Of straunge aduentures, and of perils sad,<br>
Which in his trauell him befallen had,<br>
For to demaund of his renowmed guest:<br>
Who then with vtt'rance graue, and count'nance sad<br>
From point to point, as is before exprest,<br>
Discourst his voyage long, according his request.<p>
 
Great pleasure mixt with pittifull regard,<br>
That godly King and Queene did passionate,<br>
Whiles they his pittifull aduentures heard,<br>
That oft they did lament his lucklesse state,<br>
And often blame the too importune fate,<br>
That heapd on him so many wrathfull wreakes:<br>
For neuer gentle knight, as he of late,<br>
So tossed was in fortunes cruell freakes;<br>
And all the while salt teares bedeawd the hearers cheaks.<p>
 
Then said that royall Pere in sober wise;<br>
Deare Sonne, great beene the euils, which ye bore<br>
From first to last in your late enterprise,<br>
That I note, whether prayse, or pitty more:<br>
For neuer liuing man, I weene, so sore<br>
In sea of deadly daungers was distrest;<br>
But since now safe ye seised haue the shore,<br>
And well arriued are, (high God be blest)<br>
Let vs deuize of ease and euerlasting rest.<p>
 
Ah dearest Lord, said then that doughty knight,<br>
Of ease or rest I may not yet deuize;<br>
For by the faith, which I to armes haue plight,<br>
I bounden am streight after this emprize,<br>
As that your daughter can ye well aduize,<br>
Backe to returne to that great Faerie Queene,<br>
And her to serue six yeares in warlike wize,<br>
Gainst that proud Paynim king, that workes her teene:<br>
Therefore I ought craue pardon, till I there haue beene.<p>
 
Vnhappie falles that hard necessitie,<br>
(Quoth he) the troubler of my happie peace,<br>
And vowed foe of my felicitie;<br>
Ne I against the same can iustly preace:<br>
But since that band ye cannot now release,<br>
Nor doen vndo; (for vowes may not be vaine)<br>
Soone as the terme of those six yeares shall cease,<br>
Ye then shall hither backe returne againe,<br>
The marriage to accomplish vowd betwixt you twain.<p>
 
Which for my part I couet to performe,<br>
In sort as through the world I did proclame,<br>
That who so kild that monster most deforme,<br>
And him in hardy battaile ouercame,<br>
Should haue mine onely daughter to his Dame,<br>
And of my kingdome heire apparaunt bee:<br>
Therefore since now to thee perteines the same,<br>
By dew desert of noble cheualree,<br>
Both daughter and eke kingdome, lo I yield to thee.<p>
 
Then forth he called that his daughter faire,<br>
The fairest <i>Vn'</i> his onely daughter deare,<br>
His onely daughter, and his onely heyre;<br>
Who forth proceeding with sad sober cheare,<br>
As bright as doth the morning starre appeare<br>
Out of the East, with flaming lockes bedight,<br>
To tell that dawning day is drawing neare,<br>
And to the world does bring long wished light;<br>
So faire and fresh that Lady shewd her selfe in sight.<p>
 
So faire and fresh, as freshest flowre in May;<br>
For she had layd her mournefull stole aside,<br>
And widow-like sad wimple throwne away,<br>
Wherewith her heauenly beautie she did hide,<br>
Whiles on her wearie iourney she did ride;<br>
And on her now a garment she did weare,<br>
All lilly white, withoutten spot, or pride,<br>
That seemd like silke and siluer wouen neare,<br>
But neither silke nor siluer therein did appeare.<p>
 
The blazing brightnesse of her beauties beame,<br>
And glorious light of her sunshyny face<br>
To tell, were as to striue against the streame.<br>
My ragged rimes are all too rude and bace,<br>
Her heauenly lineaments for to enchace.<br>
Ne wonder; for her owne deare loued knight,<br>
All were she dayly with himselfe in place,<br>
Did wonder much at her celestiall sight:<br>
Oft had he seene her faire, but neuer so faire dight.<p>
 
So fairely dight, when she in presence came,<br>
She to her Sire made humble reuerence,<br>
And bowed low, that her right well became,<br>
And added grace vnto her excellence:<br>
Who with great wisedome, and graue eloquence<br>
Thus gan to say. But eare he thus had said,<br>
With flying speede, and seeming great pretence,<br>
Came running in, much like a man dismaid,<br>
A Messenger with letters, which his message said.<p>
 
All in the open hall amazed stood,<br>
At suddeinnesse of that vnwarie sight,<br>
And wondred at his breathlesse hastie mood.<br>
But he for nought would stay his passage right,<br>
Till fast before the king he did alight;<br>
Where falling flat, great humblesse he did make,<br>
And kist the ground, whereon his foot was pight;<br>
Then to his hands that writ he did betake,<br>
Which he disclosing, red thus, as the paper spake.<p>
 
To thee, most mighty king of <i>Eden</i> faire,<br>
Her greeting sends in these sad lines addrest,<br>
The wofull daughter, and forsaken heire<br>
Of that great Emperour of all the West;<br>
And bids thee be aduized for the best,<br>
Ere thou thy daughter linck in holy band<br>
Of wedlocke to that new vnknowen guest:<br>
For he already plighted his right hand<br>
Vnto another loue, and to another land.<p>
 
To me sad mayd, or rather widow sad,<br>
He was affiaunced long time before,<br>
And sacred pledges he both gaue, and had,<br>
False erraunt knight, infamous, and forswore:<br>
Witnesse the burning Altars, which he swore,<br>
And guiltie heauens of his bold periury,<br>
Which though he hath polluted oft of yore,<br>
Yet I to them for iudgement iust do fly,<br>
And them coniure t'auenge this shamefull iniury.<p>
 
Therefore since mine he is, or free or bond,<br>
Or false or trew, or liuing or else dead,<br>
Withhold, O soueraine Prince, your hasty hond<br>
From knitting league with him, I you aread;<br>
Ne weene my right with strength adowne to tread,<br>
Through weakenesse of my widowhed, or woe:<br>
For truth is strong, her rightfull cause to plead,<br>
And shall find friends, if need requireth soe,<br>
So bids thee well to fare, Thy neither friend, nor foe, <i>Fidessa</i>.<p>
 
When he these bitter byting words had red,<br>
The tydings straunge did him abashed make,<br>
That still he sate long time astonished<br>
As in great muse, ne word to creature spake.<br>
At last his solemne silence thus he brake,<br>
With doubtfull eyes fast fixed on his guest;<br>
Redoubted knight, that for mine onely sake<br>
Thy life and honour late aduenturest,<br>
Let nought be hid from me, that ought to be exprest.<p>
 
What meane these bloudy vowes, and idle threats,<br>
Throwne out from womanish impatient mind?<br>
What heauens? what altars? what enraged heates<br>
Here heaped vp with termes of loue vnkind,<br>
My conscience cleare with guilty bands would bind?<br>
High God be witnesse, that I guiltlesse ame.<br>
But if your selfe, Sir knight, ye faultie find,<br>
Or wrapped be in loues of former Dame,<br>
With crime do not it couer, but disclose the same.<p>
 
To whom the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight this answere sent,<br>
My Lord, my King, be nought hereat dismayd,<br>
Till well ye wote by graue intendiment,<br>
What woman, and wherefore doth me vpbrayd<br>
With breach of loue, and loyalty betrayd.<br>
It was in my mishaps, as hitherward<br>
I lately traueild, that vnwares I strayd<br>
Out of my way, through perils straunge and hard;<br>
That day should faile me, ere I had them all declard.<p>
 
There did I find, or rather I was found<br>
Of this false woman, that <i>Fidessa</i> hight,<br>
<i>Fidessa</i> hight the falsest Dame on ground,<br>
Most false <i>Duessa</i>, royall richly dight,<br>
That easie was t'inuegle weaker sight:<br>
Who by her wicked arts, and wylie skill,<br>
Too false and strong for earthly skill or might,<br>
Vnwares me wrought vnto her wicked will,<br>
And to my foe betrayd, when least I feared ill.<p>
 
Then stepped forth the goodly royall Mayd,<br>
And on the ground her selfe prostrating low,<br>
With sober countenaunce thus to him sayd;<br>
O pardon me, my soueraigne Lord, to show<br>
The secret treasons, which of late I know<br>
To haue bene wroght by that false sorceresse.<br>
She onely she it is, that earst did throw<br>
This gentle knight into so great distresse,<br>
That death him did awaite in dayly wretchednesse.<p>
 
And now it seemes, that she suborned hath<br>
This craftie messenger with letters vaine,<br>
To worke new woe and improuided scath,<br>
By breaking of the band betwixt vs twaine;<br>
Wherein she vsed hath the practicke paine<br>
Of this false footman, clokt with simplenesse,<br>
Whom if ye please for to discouer plaine,<br>
Ye shall him <i>Archimago</i> find, I ghesse,<br>
The falsest man aliue; who tries shall find no lesse.<p>
 
The king was greatly moued at her speach,<br>
And all with suddein indignation fraight,<br>
Bad on that Messenger rude hands to reach.<br>
Eftsoones the Gard, which on his state did wait,<br>
Attacht that faitor false, and bound him strait:<br>
Who seeming sorely chauffed at his band,<br>
As chained Beare, whom cruell dogs do bait,<br>
With idle force did faine them to withstand,<br>
And often semblaunce made to scape out of their hand.<p>
 
But they him layd full low in dungeon deepe,<br>
And bound him hand and foote with yron chains.<br>
And with continuall watch did warely keepe;<br>
Who then would thinke, that by his subtile trains<br>
He could escape fowle death or deadly paines?<br>
Thus when that Princes wrath was pacifide,<br>
He gan renew the late forbidden banes,<br>
And to the knight his daughter deare he tyde,<br>
With sacred rites and vowes for euer to abyde.<p>
 
His owne two hands the holy knots did knit,<br>
That none but death for euer can deuide;<br>
His owne two hands, for such a turne most fit,<br>
The housling fire did kindle and prouide,<br>
And holy water thereon sprinckled wide;<br>
At which the bushy Teade a groome did light,<br>
And sacred lampe in secret chamber hide,<br>
Where it should not be quenched day nor night,<br>
For feare of euill fates, but burnen euer bright.<p>
 
Then gan they sprinckle all the posts with wine,<br>
And made great feast to solemnize that day;<br>
They all perfumde with frankincense diuine,<br>
And precious odours fetcht from far away,<br>
That all the house did sweat with great aray:<br>
And all the while sweete Musicke did apply<br>
Her curious skill, the warbling notes to play,<br>
To driue away the dull Melancholy;<br>
The whiles one sung a song of loue and iollity.<p>
 
During the which there was an heauenly noise<br>
Heard sound through all the Pallace pleasantly,<br>
Like as it had bene many an Angels voice,<br>
Singing before th'eternall maiesty,<br>
In their trinall triplicities on hye;<br>
Yet wist no creature, whence that heauenly sweet<br>
Proceeded, yet each one felt secretly<br>
Himselfe thereby reft of his sences meet,<br>
And rauished with rare impression in his sprite.<p>
 
Great ioy was made that day of young and old,<br>
And solemne feast proclaimd throughout the land,<br>
That their exceeding merth may not be told:<br>
Suffice it heare by signes to vnderstand<br>
The vsuall ioyes at knitting of loues band.<br>
Thrise happy man the knight himselfe did hold,<br>
Possessed of his Ladies hart and hand,<br>
And euer, when his eye did her behold,<br>
His heart did seeme to melt in pleasures manifold.<p>
 
Her ioyous presence and sweet company<br>
In full content he there did long enioy,<br>
Ne wicked enuie, ne vile gealosy<br>
His deare delights were able to annoy:<br>
Yet swimming in that sea of blisfull ioy,<br>
He nought forgot, how he whilome had sworne,<br>
In case he could that monstrous beast destroy,<br>
Vnto his Farie Queene backe to returne:<br>
The which he shortly did, and <i>Vna</i> left to mourne.<p>
 
Now strike your sailes ye iolly Mariners,<br>
For we be come vnto a quiet rode,<br>
Where we must land some of our passengers,<br>
And light this wearie vessell of her lode.<br>
Here she a while may make her safe abode,<br>
Till she repaired haue her tackles spent,<br>
And wants supplide. And then againe abroad<br>
On the long voyage whereto she is bent:<br>
Well may she speede and fairely finish her intent.<p>
