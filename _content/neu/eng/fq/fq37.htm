<blockquote>
<i>Britomart chaceth Ollyphant,<br>
findes Scudamour distrest:<br>
Assayes the house of Busyrane,<br>
where Loues spoyles are exprest.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
O
 Hatefull hellish Snake, what furie furst<br>
Brought thee from balefull house of <i>Proserpine</i>,<br>
Where in her bosome she thee long had nurst,<br>
And fostred vp with bitter milke of tine,<br>
Fowle Gealosie, that turnest loue diuine<br>
To ioylesse dread, and mak'st the louing hart<br>
With hatefull thoughts to languish and to pine,<br>
And feed it selfe with selfe-consuming smart?<br>
Of all the passions in the mind thou vilest art.<p>

O let him far be banished away,<br>
And in his stead let Loue for euer dwell,<br>
Sweet Loue, that doth his golding wings embay<br>
In blessed Nectar, and pure Pleasures well,<br>
Vntroubled of vile feare, or bitter fell.<br>
And ye faire Ladies, that your kingdomes make<br>
In th'harts of men, them gouerne wisely well,<br>
And of faire <i>Britomart</i> ensample take,<br>
That was as trew in loue, as Turtle to her make.<p>

Who with Sir <i>Satyrane</i>, as earst ye red,<br>
Forth ryding from <i>Malbeccoes</i> hostlesse hous,<br>
Far off aspyde a young man, the which fled<br>
From an huge Geaunt, that with hideous<br>
And hatefull outrage long him chaced thus;<br>
It was that <i>Ollyphant</i>, the brother deare<br>
Of that <i>Argante</i> vile and vitious,<br>
From whom the <i>Squire of Dames</i> was reft whylere;<br>
This all as bad as she, and worse, if worse ought were.<p>

For as the sister did in feminine<br>
And filthy lust exceede all woman kind,<br>
So he surpassed his sex masculine,<br>
In beastly vse that I did euer find;<br>
Whom when as <i>Britomart</i> beheld behind<br>
The fearefull boy so greedily pursew,<br>
She was emmoued in her noble mind,<br>
T'employ her puissaunce to his reskew,<br>
And pricked fiercely forward, where she him did vew.<p>

Ne was Sir <i>Satyrane</i> her far behinde,<br>
But with like fiercenesse did ensew the chace:<br>
Whom when the Gyaunt saw, he soone resinde<br>
His former suit, and from them fled apace;<br>
They after both, and boldly bad him bace,<br>
And each did striue the other to out-goe,<br>
But he them both outran a wondrous space,<br>
For he was long, and swift as any Roe,<br>
And now made better speed, t'escape his feared foe.<p>

It was not <i>Satyrane</i>, whom he did feare,<br>
But <i>Britomart</i> the flowre of chastity;<br>
For he the powre of chast hands might not beare,<br>
But alwayes did their dread encounter fly:<br>
And now so fast his feet he did apply,<br>
That he has gotten to a forrest neare,<br>
Where he is shrowded in security.<br>
The wood they enter, and search euery where,<br>
They searched diuersely, so both diuided were.<p>

Faire <i>Britomart</i> so long him followed,<br>
That she at last came to a fountaine sheare,<br>
By which there lay a knight all wallowed<br>
Vpon the grassy ground, and by him neare<br>
His haberieon, his helmet, and his speare;<br>
A little off, his shield was rudely throwne,<br>
On which the winged boy in colours cleare<br>
Depeincted was, full easie to be knowne,<br>
And he thereby, where euer it in field was showne.<p>

His face vpon the ground did groueling ly,<br>
As if he had bene slombring in the shade,<br>
That the braue Mayd would not for courtesy,<br>
Out of his quiet slomber him abrade,<br>
Nor seeme too suddeinly him to inuade:<br>
Still as she stood, she heard with grieuous throb<br>
Him grone, as if his hart were peeces made,<br>
And with most painefull pangs to sigh and sob,<br>
That pitty did the Virgins hart of patience rob.<p>

At last forth breaking into bitter plaintes<br>
He said; &ocirc; soueraigne Lord that sit'st on hye,<br>
And raignst in blis emongst thy blessed Saintes,<br>
How suffrest thou such shamefull cruelty,<br>
So long vnwreaked of thine enimy?<br>
Or hast thou, Lord, of good mens cause no heed?<br>
Or doth thy iustice sleepe, and silent ly?<br>
What booteth then the good and righteous deed,<br>
If goodnesse find no grace, nor righteousnesse no meed?<p>

If good find grace, and righteousnesse reward,<br>
Why then is <i>Amoret</i> in caytiue band,<br>
Sith that more bounteous creature neuer far'd<br>
On foot, vpon the face of liuing land?<br>
Or if that heauenly iustice may withstand<br>
The wrongfull outrage of vnrighteous men,<br>
Why then is <i>Busirane</i> with wicked hand<br>
Suffred, these seuen monethes day in secret den<br>
My Lady and my loue so cruelly to pen?<p>

My Lady and my loue is cruelly pend<br>
In dolefull darkenesse from the vew of day,<br>
Whilest deadly torments do her chast brest rend,<br>
And the sharpe steele doth riue her hart in tway,<br>
All for she <i>Scudamore</i> will not denay.<br>
Yet thou vile man, vile <i>Scudamore</i> art sound,<br>
Ne canst her ayde, ne canst her foe dismay:<br>
Vnworthy wretch to tread vpon the ground,<br>
For whom so faire a Lady feeles so sore a wound.<p>

There an huge heape of singulfes did oppresse<br>
His strugling soule, and swelling throbs empeach<br>
His foltring toung with pangs of drerinesse,<br>
Choking the remnant of his plaintife speach,<br>
As if his dayes were come to their last reach.<br>
Which when she heard, and saw the ghastly fit,<br>
Threatning into his life to make a breach,<br>
Both with great ruth and terrour she was smit,<br>
Fearing least from her cage the wearie soule would flit.<p>

Tho stooping downe she him amoued light;<br>
Who therewith somewhat starting, vp gan looke,<br>
And seeing him behind a straunger knight,<br>
Whereas no liuing creature he mistooke,<br>
With great indignaunce he that sight forsooke,<br>
And downe againe himselfe disdainefully<br>
Abiecting, th'earth with his faire forhead strooke:<br>
Which the bold Virgin seeing, gan apply<br>
Fit medcine to his griefe, and spake thus courtesly.<p>

Ah gentle knight, whose deepe conceiued griefe<br>
Well seemes t'exceede the powre of patience,<br>
Yet if that heauenly grace some good reliefe<br>
You send, submit you to high prouidence,<br>
And euer in your noble hart prepense,<br>
That all the sorrow in the world is lesse,<br>
Then vertues might, and values confidence,<br>
For who nill bide the burden of distresse,<br>
Must not here thinke to liue: for life is wretchednesse.<p>

Therefore, faire Sir, do comfort to you take,<br>
And freely read, what wicked felon so<br>
Hath outrag'd you, and thrald your gentle make.<br>
Perhaps this hand may helpe to ease your woe,<br>
And wreake your sorrow on your cruell foe,<br>
At least it faire endeuour will apply.<br>
Those feeling wordes so neare the quicke did goe,<br>
That vp his head he reared easily,<br>
And leaning on his elbow, these few wordes let fly.<p>

What boots it plaine, that cannot be redrest,<br>
And sow vaine sorrow in a fruitlesse eare,<br>
Sith powre of hand, nor skill of learned brest,<br>
Ne worldly price cannot redeeme my deare,<br>
Out of her thraldome and continuall feare?<br>
For he the tyraunt, which her hath in ward<br>
By strong enchauntments and blacke Magicke leare,<br>
Hath in a dungeon deepe her close embard,<br>
And many dreadfull feends hath pointed to her gard.<p>

There he tormenteth her most terribly,<br>
And day and night afflicts with mortall paine,<br>
Because to yield him loue she doth deny,<br>
Once to me yold, not to be yold againe:<br>
But yet by torture he would her constraine<br>
Loue to conceiue in her disdainfull brest;<br>
Till so she do, she must in doole remaine,<br>
Ne may by liuing meanes be thence relest:<br>
What boots it then to plaine, that cannot be redrest?<p>

With this sad hersall of his heauy stresse,<br>
The warlike Damzell was empassiond sore,<br>
And said; Sir knight, your cause is nothing lesse,<br>
Then is your sorrow, certes if not more;<br>
For nothing so much pitty doth implore,<br>
As gentle Ladies helplesse misery.<br>
But yet, if please ye listen to my lore,<br>
I will with proofe of last extremity,<br>
Deliuer her fro thence, or with her for you dy.<p>

Ah gentlest knight aliue, (said <i>Scudamore</i>)<br>
What huge heroicke magnanimity<br>
Dwels in thy bounteous brest? what couldst thou more,<br>
If she were thine, and thou as now am I?<br>
O spare thy happy dayes, and them apply<br>
To better boot, but let me dye, that ought;<br>
More is more losse: one is enough to dy.<br>
Life is not lost, (said she) for which is bought<br>
Endlesse renowm, that more then death is to be sought.<p>

Thus she at length perswaded him to rise,<br>
And with her wend, to see what new successe<br>
Mote him befall vpon new enterprise;<br>
His armes, which he had vowed to disprofesse,<br>
She gathered vp and did about him dresse,<br>
And his forwandred steed vnto him got:<br>
So forth they both yfere make their progresse,<br>
And march not past the mountenaunce of a shot.<br>
Till they arriu'd, whereas their purpose they did plot.<p>

There they dismounting, drew their weapons bold<br>
And stoutly came vnto the Castle gate;<br>
Whereas no gate they found, them to withhold,<br>
Nor ward to wait at morne and euening late,<br>
But in the Porch, that did them sore amate,<br>
A flaming fire, ymixt with smouldry smoke,<br>
And stinking Sulphure, that with griesly hate<br>
And dreadfull horrour did all entraunce choke,<br>
Enforced them their forward footing to reuoke.<p>

Greatly thereat was <i>Britomart</i> dismayd,<br>
Ne in that stownd wist, how her selfe to beare;<br>
For daunger vaine it were, to haue assayd<br>
That cruell element, which all things feare,<br>
Ne none can suffer to approchen neare:<br>
And turning backe to <i>Scudamour</i>, thus sayd;<br>
What monstrous enmity prouoke we heare,<br>
Foolhardy as th'Earthes children, the which made<br>
Battell against the Gods? so we a God inuade.<p>

Daunger without discretion to attempt,<br>
Inglorious and beastlike is: therefore Sir knight,<br>
Aread what course of you is safest dempt,<br>
And how we with our foe may come to fight.<br>
This is (quoth he) the dolorous despight,<br>
Which earst to you I playnd: for neither may<br>
This fire be quencht by any wit or might,<br>
Ne yet by any meanes remou'd away,<br>
So mighty be th'enchauntments, which the same do stay.<p>

What is there else, but cease these fruitlesse paines,<br>
And leaue me to my former languishing;<br>
Faire <i>Amoret</i> must dwell in wicked chaines,<br>
And <i>Scudamore</i> here dye with sorrowing.<br>
Perdy not so; (said she) for shamefull thing<br>
It were t'abandon noble cheuisaunce,<br>
For shew of perill, without venturing:<br>
Rather let try extremities of chaunce,<br>
Then enterprised prayse for dread to disauaunce.<p>

Therewith resolu'd to proue her vtmost might,<br>
Her ample shield she threw before her face,<br>
And her swords point directing forward right,<br>
Assayld the flame, the which eftsoones gaue place,<br>
And did it selfe diuide with equall space,<br>
That through she passed; as a thunder bolt<br>
Perceth the yielding ayre, and doth displace<br>
The soring clouds into sad showres ymolt;<br>
So to her yold the flames, and did their force reuolt,<p>

Whom whenas <i>Scudamour</i> saw past the fire,<br>
Safe and vntoucht, he likewise gan assay,<br>
With greedy will, and enuious desire,<br>
And bad the stubborne flames to yield him way:<br>
But cruell <i>Mulciber</i> would not obay<br>
His threatfull pride, but did the more augment<br>
His mighty rage, and with imperious sway<br>
Him forst (maulgre) his fiercenesse to relent,<br>
And backe retire, all scorcht and pitifully brent.<p>

With huge impatience he inly swelt,<br>
More for great sorrow, that he could not pas,<br>
Then for the burning torment, which he felt,<br>
That with fell woodnesse he effierced was,<br>
And wilfully him throwing on the gras,<br>
Did beat and bounse his head and brest full sore;<br>
The whiles the Championesse now entred has<br>
The vtmost rowme, and past the formest dore,<br>
The vtmost rowme, abounding with all precious store.<p>

For round about, the wals yclothed were<br>
With goodly arras of great maiesty,<br>
Wouen with gold and silke so close and nere,<br>
That the rich metall lurked priuily,<br>
As faining to be hid from enuious eye;<br>
Yet here, and there, and euery where vnwares<br>
It shewd it selfe, and shone vnwillingly;<br>
Like a discolourd Snake, whose hidden snares<br>
Through the greene gras his long bright burnisht backe declares.<p>

And in those Tapets weren fashioned<br>
Many faire pourtraicts, and many a faire feate,<br>
And all of loue, and all of lusty-hed,<br>
As seemed by their semblaunt did entreat;<br>
And eke all <i>Cupids</i> warres they did repeate,<br>
And cruell battels, which he whilome fought<br>
Gainst all the Gods, to make his empire great;<br>
Besides the huge massacres, which he wrought<br>
On mighty kings and kesars, into thraldome brought.<p>

Therein was writ, how often thundring <i>Ioue</i><br>
Had felt the point of his hart-percing dart,<br>
And leauing heauens kingdome, here did roue<br>
In straunge disguize, to slake his scalding smart;<br>
Now like a Ram, faire <i>Helle</i> to peruart,<br>
Now like a Bull, <i>Europa</i> to withdraw:<br>
Ah, how the fearefull Ladies tender hart<br>
Did liuely seeme to tremble, wheh she saw<br>
The huge seas vnder her t'obay her seruaunts law.<p>

Soone after that into a golden showre<br>
Him selfe he chaung'd faire <i>Dana&euml;</i> to vew,<br>
And through the roofe of her strong brasen towre<br>
Did raine into her lap an hony dew,<br>
The whiles her foolish garde, that little knew<br>
Of such deceipt, kept th'yron dore fast bard,<br>
And watcht, that none should enter nor issew;<br>
Vaine was the watch, and bootlesse all the ward,<br>
Whenas the God to golden hew him selfe transfard.<p>

Then was he turnd into a snowy Swan,<br>
To win faire <i>Leda</i> to his louely trade:<br>
O wondrous skill, and sweet wit of the man,<br>
That her in daffadillies sleeping made,<br>
From scorching heat her daintie limbes to shade:<br>
Whiles the proud Bird ruffing his fethers wyde,<br>
And brushing his faire brest, did her inuade;<br>
She slept, yet twixt her eyelids closely spyde,<br>
How towards her he rusht, and smiled at his pryde.<p>

Then shewd it, how the <i>Thebane Semelee</i><br>
Deceiu'd of gealous <i>Iuno</i>, did require<br>
To see him in his soueraigne maiestee,<br>
Armd with his thunderbolts and lightning fire,<br>
Whence dearely she with death bought her desire.<br>
But faire <i>Alcmena</i> better match did make,<br>
Ioying his loue in likenesse more entire;<br>
Three nights in one, they say, that for her sake<br>
He then did put, her pleasures lenger to partake.<p>

Twise was he seene in soaring Eagles shape,<br>
And with wide wings to beat the buxome ayre,<br>
Once, when he with <i>Asterie</i> did scape,<br>
Againe, when as the <i>Troiane</i> boy so faire<br>
He snatcht from <i>Ida</i> hill, and with him bare:<br>
Wondrous delight it was, there to behould,<br>
How the rude Shepheards after him did stare,<br>
Trembling through feare, least down he fallen should,<br>
And often to him calling, to take surer hould.<p>

In <i>Satyres</i> shape <i>Antiopa</i> he snatcht:<br>
And like a fire, when he <i>Aegin'</i> assayd:<br>
A shepheard, when <i>Mnemosyne</i> he catcht:<br>
And like a Serpent to the <i>Thracian</i> mayd.<br>
Whiles thus on earth great <i>Ioue</i> these pageaunts playd,<br>
The winged boy did thrust into his throne,<br>
And scoffing, thus vnto his mother sayd,<br>
Lo now the heauens obey to me alone,<br>
And take me for their <i>Ioue</i>, whiles <i>Ioue</i> to earth is gone.<p>

And thou, faire <i>Phoebus</i>, in thy colours bright<br>
Wast there enwouen, and the sad distresse,<br>
In which that boy thee plonged, for despight,<br>
That thou bewray'dst his mothers wantonnesse,<br>
When she with <i>Mars</i> was meynt in ioyfulnesse:<br>
For thy, he thrild thee with a leaden dart,<br>
To loue faire <i>Daphne</i>, which thee loued lesse:<br>
Lesse she thee lou'd, then was thy iust desart,<br>
Yet was thy loue her death, &amp; her death was thy smart.<p>

So louedst thou the lusty <i>Hyacinct</i>,<br>
So louedst thou the faire <i>Coronis</i> deare:<br>
Yet both are of thy haplesse hand extinct,<br>
Yet both in flowres do liue, and loue thee beare,<br>
The one a Paunce, the other a sweet breare:<br>
For griefe whereof, ye mote haue liuely seene<br>
The God himselfe rending his golden heare,<br>
And breaking quite his gyrlond euer greene,<br>
With other signes of sorrow and impatient teene.<p>

Both for those two, and for his owne deare sonne,<br>
The sonne of <i>Climene</i> he did repent,<br>
Who bold to guide the charet of the Sunne,<br>
Himselfe in thousand peeces fondly rent,<br>
And all the world with flashing fier brent;<br>
So like, that all the walles did seeme to flame.<br>
Yet cruell <i>Cupid</i>, not herewith content,<br>
Forst him eftsoones to follow other game,<br>
And loue a Shepheards daughter for his dearest Dame.<p>

He loued <i>Isse</i> for his dear est Dame,<br>
And for her sake her cattell fed a while,<br>
And for her sake a cowheard vile became,<br>
The seruant of <i>Admetus</i> cowheard vile,<br>
Whiles that from heauen he suffered exile.<br>
Long were to tell each other louely fit,<br>
Now like a Lyon, hunting after spoile,<br>
Now like a Stag, now like a faulcon flit:<br>
All which in that faire arras was most liuely writ.<p>

Next vnto him was <i>Neptune</i> pictured,<br>
In his diuine resemblance wondrous lyke:<br>
His face was rugged, and his hoarie hed<br>
Dropped with brackish deaw; his three-forkt Pyke<br>
He stearnly shooke, and therewith fierce did stryke<br>
The raging billowes, that on euery syde<br>
They trembling stood, and made a long broad dyke,<br>
That his swift charet might haue passage wyde,<br>
Which foure great <i>Hippodames</i> did draw in temewise tyde.<p>

His sea-horses did seeme to sport amayne,<br>
And from their nosethrilles blow the brynie streame,<br>
That made the sparckling waues to smoke agayne,<br>
And flame with gold, but the white fomy creame,<br>
Did shine with siluer, and shoot forth his beame.<br>
The God himselfe did pensiue seeme and sad,<br>
And hong adowne his head, as he did dreame:<br>
For priuy loue his brest empierced had,<br>
Ne ought but deare <i>Bisaltis</i> ay could make him glad.<p>

He loued eke <i>Iphimedia</i> deare,<br>
And <i>Aeolus</i> faire daughter <i>Arne</i> hight.<br>
For whom he turnd him selfe into a Steare,<br>
And fed on fodder, to beguile her sight.<br>
Also to win <i>Deucalions</i> daughter bright,<br>
He turnd him selfe into a Dolphin fayre;<br>
And like a winged horse he tooke his flight,<br>
To snaky-locke <i>Medusa</i> to repayre,<br>
On whom he got faire <i>Pegasus</i>, that flitteth in the ayre.<p>

Next <i>Saturne</i> was, (but who would euer weene,<br>
That sullein <i>Saturne</i> euer weend to loue?<br>
Yet loue is sullein, and <i>Saturnlike</i> seene,<br>
As he did for <i>Erigone</i> it proue,)<br>
That to a <i>Centaure</i> did him selfe transmoue.<br>
So proou'd it eke that gracious God of wine,<br>
When for to compasse <i>Philliras</i> hard loue,<br>
He turnd himselfe into a fruitfull vine,<br>
And into her faire bosome made his grapes decline.<p>

Long were to tell the amorous assayes,<br>
And gentle pangues, with which he maked meeke<br>
The mighty <i>Mars</i>, to learne his wanton playes:<br>
How oft for <i>Venus</i>, and how often eek<br>
For many other Nymphes he sore did shreek,<br>
With womanish teares, and with vnwarlike smarts,<br>
Priuily moystening his horrid cheek.<br>
There was he painted full of burning darts,<br>
And many wide woundes launched through his inner parts.<p>

Ne did he spare (so cruell was the Elfe)<br>
His owne deare mother, (ah why should he so?)<br>
Ne did he spare sometime to pricke himselfe,<br>
That he might taste the sweet consuming woe,<br>
Which he had wrought to many others moe.<br>
But to declare the mournfull Tragedyes,<br>
And spoiles, wherewith he all the ground did strow,<br>
More eath to number, with how many eyes<br>
High heauen beholds sad louers nightly theeueryes.<p>

Kings Queenes, Lords Ladies, Knights &amp; Damzels gent<br>
Were heap'd together with the vulgar sort,<br>
And mingled with the raskall rablement,<br>
Without respect of person or of port,<br>
To shew Dan <i>Cupids</i> powre and great effort:<br>
And round about a border was entrayld,<br>
Of broken bowes and arrowes shiuered short,<br>
And a long bloudy riuer through them rayld,<br>
So liuely and so like, that liuing sence it fayld.<p>

And at the vpper end of that faire rowme,<br>
There was an Altar built of pretious stone,<br>
Of passing valew, and of great renowme,<br>
On which there stood an Image all alone,<br>
Of massy gold, which with his owne light shone;<br>
And wings it had with sundry colours dight,<br>
More sundry colours, then the proud <i>Pauone</i><br>
Beares in his boasted fan, or <i>Iris</i> bright,<br>
When her discolourd bow she spreds through heauens hight.<p>

Blindfold he was, and in his cruell fist<br>
A mortall bow and arrowes keene did hold,<br>
With which he shot at randon, when him list,<br>
Some headed with sad lead, some with pure gold;<br>
(Ah man beware, how thou those darts behold)<br>
A wounded Dragon vnder him did ly,<br>
Whose hideous tayle his left foot did enfold,<br>
And with a shaft was shot through either eye,<br>
That no man forth might draw, ne no man remedye.<p>

And vnderneath his feet was written thus,<br>
<i>Vnto the Victor of the Gods this bee:</i><br>
And all the people in that ample hous<br>
Did to that image bow their humble knee,<br>
And oft committed fowle Idolatree.<br>
That wondrous sight faire <i>Britomart</i> amazed,<br>
Ne seeing could her wonder satisfie,<br>
But euermore and more vpon it gazed,<br>
The whiles the passing brightnes her fraile sences dazed.<p>

Tho as she backward cast her busie eye,<br>
To search each secret of that goodly sted,<br>
Ouer the dore thus written she did spye<br>
<i>Be bold</i>: she oft and oft it ouer-red,<br>
Yet could not find what sence it figured:<br>
But what so were therein or writ or ment,<br>
She was no whit thereby discouraged<br>
From prosecuting of her first intent,<br>
But forward with bold steps into the next roome went.<p>

Much fairer, then the former, was that roome,<br>
And richlier by many partes arayd:<br>
For not with arras made in painefull loome,<br>
But with pure gold it all was ouerlayd,<br>
Wrought with wilde Antickes, which their follies playd,<br>
In the rich metall, as they liuing were:<br>
A thousand monstrous formes therein were made,<br>
Such as false loue doth oft vpon him weare:<br>
For loue in thousand monstrous formes doth oft appeare.<p>

And all about, the glistring walles were hong<br>
With warlike spoiles, and with victorious prayes,<br>
Of mighty Conquerours and Captaines strong,<br>
Which were whilome captiued in their dayes<br>
To cruell loue, and wrought their owne decayes:<br>
Their swerds &amp; speres were broke, &amp; hauberques rent;<br>
And their proud girlonds of tryumphant bayes<br>
Troden in dust with fury insolent,<br>
To shew the victors might and mercilesse intent.<p>

The warlike Mayde beholding earnestly<br>
The goodly ordinance of this rich place,<br>
Did greatly wonder, ne could satisfie<br>
Her greedy eyes with gazing a long space:<br>
But more she meruaild that no footings trace,<br>
Nor wight appear'd, but wastefull emptinesse,<br>
And solemne silence ouer all that place:<br>
Straunge thing it seem'd, that none was to possesse<br>
So rich purueyance, ne them keepe with carefulnesse.<p>

And as she lookt about, she did behold,<br>
How ouer that same dore was likewise writ,<br>
<i>Be bold</i>, <i>be bold</i>, and euery where <i>Be bold</i>,<br>
That much she muz'd, yet could not construe it<br>
By any ridling skill, or commune wit.<br>
At last she spyde at that roomes vpper end,<br>
Another yron dore, on which was writ,<br>
<i>Be not too bold</i>; whereto though she did bend<br>
Her earnest mind, yet wist not what it might intend.<p>

Thus she there waited vntill euentyde,<br>
Yet liuing creature none she saw appeare:<br>
And now sad shadowes gan the world to hyde,<br>
From mortall vew, and wrap in darkenesse dreare;<br>
Yet nould she d'off her weary armes, for feare<br>
Of secret daunger, ne let sleepe oppresse<br>
Her heauy eyes with natures burdein deare,<br>
But drew her selfe aside in sickernesse,<br>
And her welpointed weapons did about her dresse.<p>
