<i>A chronicle of Briton kings,<br>
from Brute to Vthers rayne.<br>
And rolles of Elfin Emperours,<br>
till time of Gloriane.</i><p>

W
Ho now shall giue vnto me words and sound,<br>
Equall vnto this haughtie enterprise?<br>
Or who shall lend me wings, with which from ground<br>
Lowly verse may loftily arise,<br>
And lift it selfe vnto the highest skies?<br>
More ample spirit, then hitherto was wount,<br>
Here needes me, whiles the famous auncestries<br>
Of my most dreaded Soueraigne I recount,<br>
By which all earthly Princes she doth farre surmount.<p>
 
Ne vnder Sunne, that shines so wide and faire,<br>
Whence all that liues, does borrow life and light,<br>
Liues ought, that to her linage may compaire,<br>
Which though from earth it be deriued right,<br>
Yet doth it selfe stretch forth to heauens hight,<br>
And all the world with wonder ouerspred;<br>
A labour huge, exceeding farre my might:<br>
How shall fraile pen, with feare disparaged,<br>
Conceiue such soueraine glory, and great bountihed?<p>
 
Argument worthy of <i>Moeonian</i> quill,<br>
Or rather worthy of great <i>Phoebus</i> rote,<br>
Whereon the ruines of great <i>Ossa</i> hill,<br>
And triumphes of <i>Phlegr&aelig;an Ioue</i> he wrote,<br>
That all the Gods admird his loftie note.<br>
But if some relish of that heauenly lay<br>
His learned daughters would to me report,<br>
To decke my song withall, I would assay,<br>
Thy name, &ocirc: soueraine Queene, to blazon farre away.<p>
 
Thy name &ocirc: soueraine Queene, thy realme and race,<br>
From this renowmed Prince deriued arre,<br>
Who mightily vpheld that royall mace,<br>
Which now thou bear'st, to thee descended farre<br>
From mightie kings and conquerours in warre,<br>
Thy fathers and great Grandfathers of old,<br>
Whose noble deedes aboue the Northerne starre<br>
Immortall fame for euer hath enrold;<br>
As in that old mans booke they were in order told.<p>
 
The land, which warlike Britons now possesse,<br>
And therein haue their mightie empire raysd,<br>
In antique times was saluage wildernesse,<br>
Vnpeopled, vnmanurd, vnprou'd, vnpraysd,<br>
Ne was it Island then, ne was it paysd<br>
Amid the <i>Ocean</i> waues, ne was it sought<br>
Of marchants farre, for profits therein praysd,<br>
But was all desolate, and of some thought<br>
By sea to haue bene fr&otilde; the <i>Celticke</i> mayn-land brought.<p>
 
Ne did it then deserue a name to haue,<br>
Till that the venturous Mariner that way<br>
Learning his ship from those white rocks to saue,<br>
Which all along the Southerne sea-coast lay,<br>
Threatning vnheedie wrecke and rash decay,<br>
For safeties sake that same his sea-marke made,<br>
And named it <i>Albion</i>.  But later day<br>
Finding in it fit ports for fishers trade,<br>
Gan more the same frequent, and further to inuade.<p>
 
But farre in land a saluage nation dwelt,<br>
Of hideous Giants, and halfe beastly men,<br>
That neuer tasted grace, nor goodnesse felt,<br>
But like wild beasts lurking in loathsome den,<br>
And flying fast as Roebucke through the fen,<br>
All naked without shame, or care of cold,<br>
By hunting and by spoiling liued then;<br>
Of stature huge, and eke of courage bold,<br>
That sonnes of men amazd their sternnesse to behold.<p>
 
But whence they sprong, or how they were begot,<br>
Vneath is to assure; vneath to wene<br>
That monstrous error, which doth some assot,<br>
That <i>Dioclesians</i> fiftie daughters shene<br>
Into this land by chaunce haue driuen bene,<br>
Where companing with feends and filthy Sprights,<br>
Through vaine illusion of their lust vnclene,<br>
They brought forth Giants and such dreadfull wights,<br>
As farre exceeded men in their immeasurd mights.<p>
 
They held this land, and with their filthinesse<br>
Polluted this same gentle soyle long time:<br>
That their owne mother loathd their beastlinesse,<br>
And gan abhorre her broods vnkindly crime,<br>
All were they borne of her owne natiue slime,<br>
Vntill that <i>Brutus</i> anciently deriu'd<br>
From royall stocke of old <i>Assaracs</i> line,<br>
Driuen by fatall error, here arriu'd,<br>
And them of their vniust possession depriu'd.<p>
 
But ere he had established his throne,<br>
And spred his empire to the vtmost shore,<br>
He fought great battels with his saluage fone;<br>
In which he them defeated euermore,<br>
And many Giants left on groning flore;<br>
That well can witnesse yet vnto this day<br>
The westerne Hogh, besprincled with the gore<br>
Of mightie <i>G&ouml;emot</i>, whom in stout fray<br>
<i>Corineus</i> conquered, and cruelly did slay.<p>
 
And eke that ample Pit, yet farre renownd,<br>
For the large leape, which <i>Debon</i> did compell<br>
<i>Coulin</i> to make, being eight lugs of grownd;<br>
Into the which returning backe, he fell:<br>
But those three monstrous stones doe most excell<br>
Which that huge sonne of hideous <i>Albion</i>,<br>
Whose father <i>Hercules</i> in Fraunce did quell,<br>
Great <i>Godmer</i> threw, in fierce contention,<br>
At bold <i>Canutus</i>; but of him was slaine anon.<p>
 
In meed of these great conquests by them got,<br>
<i>Corineus</i> had that Prouince vtmost west,<br>
To him assigned for his worthy lot,<br>
Which of his name and memorable gest<br>
He called <i>Cornewaile</i>, yet so called best:<br>
And <i>Debons</i> shayre was, that is <i>Deuonshyre</i>:<br>
But <i>Canute</i> had his portion from the rest,<br>
The which he cald <i>Canutium</i>, for his hyre;<br>
Now <i>Cantium</i>, which Kent we commenly inquire.<p>
 
Thus <i>Brute</i> this Realme vnto his rule subdewd,<br>
And raigned long in great felicitie,<br>
Lou'd of his friends, and of his foes eschewd,<br>
He left three sonnes, his famous progeny,<br>
Borne of faire <i>Inogene</i> of <i>Italy</i>;<br>
Mongst whom he parted his imperiall state,<br>
And <i>Locrine</i> left chiefe Lord of <i>Britany</i>.<br>
At last ripe age bad him surrender late<br>
His life, and long good fortune vnto finall fate.<p>
 
<i>Locrine</i> was left the soueraine Lord of all;<br>
But <i>Albanact</i> had all the Northrene part,<br>
Which of himselfe <i>Albania</i> he did call;<br>
And <i>Camber</i> did possesse the Westerne quart,<br>
Which <i>Seuerne</i> now from <i>Logris</i> doth depart:<br>
And each his portion peaceably enioyd,<br>
Ne was there outward breach, nor grudge in hart,<br>
That once their quiet gouernment annoyd,<br>
But each his paines to others profit still employd.<p>
 
Vntill a nation straung, with visage swart,<br>
And courage fierce, that all men did affray,<br>
Which through the world th&#7869; swarmd in euery part,<br>
And ouerflow'd all countries farre away,<br>
Like <i>Noyes</i> great flood, with their importune sway,<br>
This land inuaded with like violence,<br>
And did themselues through all the North display:<br>
Vntill that <i>Locrine</i> for his Realmes defence,<br>
Did head against them make, and strong munificence.<p>
 
He them encountred, a confused rout,<br>
Foreby the Riuer, that whylome was hight<br>
The auncient <i>Abus</i>, where with courage stout<br>
He them defeated in victorious fight,<br>
And chaste so fiercely after fearfull flight,<br>
That forst their Chieftaine, for his safeties sake,<br>
(Their Chieftaine <i>Humber</i> named was aright)<br>
Vnto the mightie streame him to betake,<br>
Where he an end of battell, and of life did make.<p>
 
The king returned proud of victorie,<br>
And insolent wox through vnwonted ease,<br>
That shortly he forgot the ieopardie,<br>
Which in his land he lately did appease,<br>
And fell to vaine voluptuous disease:<br>
He lou'd faire Ladie <i>Estrild</i>, lewdly lou'd,<br>
Whose wanton pleasures him too much did please.<br>
That quite his hart from <i>Guendolene</i> remou'd,<br>
Fr&otilde; <i>Guendolene</i> his wife, though alwaies faithfull prou'd.<p>
 
The noble daughter of <i>Corineus</i><br>
Would not endure to be so vile disdaind,<br>
But gathering force, and courage valorous,<br>
Encountred him in battell well ordaind,<br>
In which him vanquisht she to fly constraind:<br>
But she so fast pursewd, that him she tooke,<br>
And threw in bands, where he till death remaind;<br>
Als his faire Leman, flying through a brooke,<br>
She ouerhent, nought moued with her piteous looke.<p>
 
But both her selfe, and eke her daughter deare,<br>
Begotten by her kingly Paramoure,<br>
The faire <i>Sabrina</i> almost dead with feare,<br>
She there attached, farre from all succoure;<br>
The one she slew in that impatient stoure,<br>
But the sad virgin innocent of all,<br>
Adowne the rolling riuer she did poure,<br>
Which of her name now <i>Seuerne</i> men do call:<br>
Such was the end, that to disloyall loue did fall.<p>
 
Then for her sonne, which she to <i>Locrin</i> bore,<br>
<i>Madan</i> was young, vnmeet the rule of sway,<br>
In her owne hande the crowne she kept in store,<br>
Till ryper yeares he raught, and stronger stay:<br>
During which time her powre she did display<br>
Through all this realme, the glorie of her sex,<br>
And first taught men a woman to obay:<br>
But when her sonne to mans estate did wex,<br>
She it surrendred, ne her selfe would lenger vex.<p>
 
Tho <i>Madan</i> raignd, vnworthie of his race:<br>
For with all shame that sacred throne he fild:<br>
Next <i>Memprise</i>, as vnworthy of that place,<br>
In which being consorted with <i>Manild</i>,<br>
For thirst of single kingdome him he kild.<br>
But <i>Ebranck</i> salued both their infamies<br>
With noble deedes, and warreyd on <i>Brunchild</i><br>
In <i>Henault</i>, where yet of his victories<br>
Braue moniments remaine, which yet that land enuies.<p>
 
An happie man in his first dayes he was,<br>
And happie father of faire progeny:<br>
For all so many weekes as the yeare has,<br>
So many children he did multiply;<br>
Of which were twentie sonnes, which did apply,<br>
Their minds to praise, and cheualrous desire:<br>
Those germans did subdew all Germany,<br>
Of whom it hight; but in the end their Sire<br>
With foule repulse from Fraunce was forced to retire.<p>
 
Which blot his sonne succeeding in his seat,<br>
The second <i>Brute</i>, the second both in name,<br>
And eke in semblance of his puissance great,<br>
Right well recur'd, and did away that blame<br>
With recompence of euerlasting fame.<br>
He with his victour sword first opened,<br>
The bowels of wide Fraunce, a forlorne Dame,<br>
And taught her first how to be conquered;<br>
Since which, with sundrie spoiles she hath beene ransacked.<p>
 
Let <i>Scaldis</i> tell, and let tell <i>Hania</i>,<br>
And let the marsh of <i>Estham bruges</i> tell,<br>
What colour were their waters that same day,<br>
And all the moore twixt <i>Eluersham</i> and <i>Dell</i>,<br>
With bloud of <i>Henalois</i>, which therein fell.<br>
How oft that day did sad <i>Brunchildis</i> see<br>
The greene shield dyde in dolorous vermell?<br>
That not <i>Scuith guiridh</i> it mote seeme to bee<br>
But rather <i>y Scuith gogh</i>, signe of sad crueltee.<p>
 
His sonne king <i>Leill</i> by fathers labour long,<br>
Enioyd an heritage of lasting peace,<br>
And built <i>Cairleill</i>, and built <i>Cairleon</i> strong.<br>
Next <i>Huddibras</i> his realme did not encrease,<br>
But taught the land from wearie warres to cease.<br>
Whose footsteps <i>Bladud</i> following in arts<br>
Exceld at <i>Athens</i> all the learned preace,<br>
From whence he brought them to these saluage parts,<br>
And with sweet science mollifide their stubborne harts.<p>
 
Ensample of his wondrous faculty,<br>
Behold the boyling Bathes at <i>Cairbadon</i>,<br>
Which seeth with secret fire eternally,<br>
And in their entrails, full of quicke Brimston,<br>
Nourish the flames, which they are warm'd vpon,<br>
That to their people wealth they forth do well,<br>
And health to euery forreine nation:<br>
Yet he at last contending to excell<br>
The reach of men, through flight into fond mischief fell.<p>
 
Next him king <i>Leyr</i> in happie peace long raind,<br>
But had no issue male him to succeed,<br>
But three faire daughters, which were well vptraind,<br>
In all that seemed fit for kingly seed:<br>
Mongst whom his realme he equally decreed<br>
To have diuided.  Tho when feeble age<br>
Nigh to his vtmost date he saw proceed,<br>
He cald his daughters; and with speeches sage<br>
Inquyrd, which of them most did loue her parentage.<p>
 
The eldest <i>Gonorill</i> gan to protest,<br>
That she much more then her owne life him lou'd:<br>
And <i>Regan</i> greater loue to him profest,<br>
Then all the world, when euer it were proou'd;<br>
But <i>Cordeill</i> said she lou'd him, as behoou'd:<br>
Whose simple answere, wanting colours faire<br>
To paint it forth, him to displeasance moou'd,<br>
That in his crowne he counted her no haire,<br>
But twixt the other twaine his kingdome whole did shaire.<p>
 
So wedded th'one to <i>Maglan</i> king of Scots,<br>
And th'other to the king of <i>Cambria</i>,<br>
And twixt them shayrd his realme by equall lots:<br>
But without dowre the wise <i>Cordelia</i><br>
Was sent to <i>Aganip</i> of <i>Celtica</i>.<br>
Their aged Syre, thus eased of his crowne,<br>
A priuate life led in <i>Albania</i>,<br>
With <i>Gonorill</i>, long had in great renowne,<br>
That nought him grieu'd to bene from rule deposed downe.<p>
 
But true it is, that when the oyle is spent,<br>
The light goes out, and weeke is throwne away;<br>
So when he had resigned his regiment,<br>
His daughter gan despise his drouping day,<br>
And wearie waxe of his continuall stay.<br>
Tho to his daughter <i>Rigan</i> he repayrd,<br>
Who him at first well vsed euery way;<br>
But when of his departure she despayrd,<br>
Her bountie she abated, and his cheare empayrd.<p>
 
The wretched man gan then auise too late,<br>
That loue is not, where most it is profest,<br>
Too truely tryde in his extreamest state;<br>
At last resolu'd likewise to proue the rest,<br>
He to <i>Cordelia</i> him selfe addrest,<br>
Who with entire affection him receau'd,<br>
As for her Syre and king her seemed best;<br>
And after all an army strong she leau'd,<br>
To war on those, which him had of his realme bereau'd.<p>
 
So to his crowne she him restor'd againe,<br>
In which he dyde, made ripe for death by eld,<br>
And after wild, it should to her remaine:<br>
Who peaceably the same long time did weld:<br>
And all mens harts in dew obedience held:<br>
Till that her sisters children, woxen strong<br>
Through proud ambition, against her rebeld,<br>
And ouercommen kept in prison long,<br>
Till wearie of that wretched life, her selfe she hong.<p>
 
Then gan the bloudie brethren both to raine:<br>
But fierce <i>Cundah</i> gan shortly to enuie<br>
His brother <i>Morgan</i>, prickt with proud disdaine,<br>
To haue a pere in part of soueraintie,<br>
And kindling coles of cruell enmitie,<br>
Raisd warre, and him in battell ouerthrew:<br>
Whence as he to those woodie hils did flie,<br>
Which hight of him <i>Glamorgan</i>, there him slew:<br>
Then did he raigne alone, when he none equall knew.<p>
 
His sonne <i>Riuallo</i> his dead roome did supply,<br>
In whose sad time bloud did from heauen raine:<br>
Next great <i>Gurgustus</i>, then faire <i>C&aelig;cily</i><br>
In constant peace their kingdomes did containe,<br>
After whom <i>Lago</i>, and <i>Kinmarke</i> did raine,<br>
And <i>Gorbogud</i>, till farre in yeares he grew:<br>
Then his ambitious sonnes vnto them twaine<br>
Arraught the rule, and from their father drew,<br>
Stout <i>Ferrex</i> and sterne <i>Porrex</i> him in prison threw.<p>
 
But &ocirc:, the greedy thirst of royall crowne,<br>
That knowes no kinred, nor regardes no right,<br>
Stird <i>Porrex</i> vp to put his brother downe;<br>
Who vnto him assembling forreine might,<br>
Made warre on him, and fell him selfe in fight:<br>
Whose death t'auenge, his mother mercilesse,<br>
Most mercilesse of women, <i>VVyden</i> hight,<br>
Her other sonne fast sleeping did oppresse,<br>
And with most cruell hand him murdred pittilesse.<p>
 
Here ended <i>Brutus</i> sacred progenie,<br>
Which had seuen hundred yeares this scepter borne,<br>
With high renowme, and great felicitie?<br>
The noble braunch from th'antique stocke was torne<br>
Through discord, and the royall throne forlorne:<br>
Thenceforth this Realme was into factions rent,<br>
Whilest each of <i>Brutus</i> boasted to be borne,<br>
That in the end was left no moniment<br>
Of <i>Brutus</i>, nor of Britons glory auncient.<p>
 
Then vp arose a man of matchlesse might,<br>
And wondrous wit to menage high affaires,<br>
Who stird with pitty of the stressed plight<br>
Of this sad Realme, cut into sundry shaires<br>
By such, as claymd themselues <i>Brutes</i> rightfull haires,<br>
Gathered the Princes of the people loose,<br>
To taken counsell of their common cares;<br>
Who with his wisedom won, him streight did choose<br>
Their king, and swore him fealty to win or loose.<p>
 
Then made he head against his enimies,<br>
And <i>Ymner</i> slew, or <i>Logris</i> miscreate;<br>
Then <i>Ruddoc</i> and proud <i>Stater</i>, both allyes,<br>
This of <i>Albanie</i> newly nominate,<br>
And that of <i>Cambry</i> king confirmed late,<br>
He ouerthrew through his owne valiaunce;<br>
Whose countreis he redus'd to quiet state,<br>
And shortly brought to ciuill gouernaunce,<br>
Now one, which earst were many, made through variaunce.<p>
 
Then made he sacred lawes, which some men say<br>
Were vnto him reueald in vision,<br>
By which he freed the Traueilers high way,<br>
The Churches part, and Ploughmans portion,<br>
Restraining stealth, and strong extortion;<br>
The gracious <i>Numa</i> of great <i>Britanie</i>:<br>
For till his dayes, the chiefe dominion<br>
By strength was wielded without pollicie;<br>
Therefore he first wore crowne of gold for dignitie.<p>
 
<i>Donwallo</i> dyde (for what may liue for ay?)<br>
And left two sonnes, of pearelesse prowesse both;<br>
That sacked <i>Rome</i> too dearely did assay,<br>
The recompence of their periured oth,<br>
And ransackt <i>Greece</i> well tryde, wh&#7869; they were wroth;<br>
Besides subiected <i>Fraunce</i>, and <i>Germany</i>,<br>
Which yet their prayses speake, all be they loth,<br>
And inly tremble at the memory<br>
Of <i>Brennus</i> and <i>Bellinus</i>, kings of Britany.<p>
 
Next them did <i>Gurgunt</i>, great <i>Bellinus</i> sonne<br>
In rule succeede, and eke in fathers prayse;<br>
He Easterland subdewd, and Danmarke wonne,<br>
And of them both did foy and tribute raise,<br>
The which was dew in his dead fathers dayes:<br>
He also gaue to fugitiues of <i>Spayne</i>,<br>
Whom he at sea found wandring from their wayes,<br>
A seate in <i>Ireland</i> safely to remayne,<br>
Which they should hold of him, as subiect to <i>Britayne</i>.<p>
 
After him raigned <i>Guitheline</i> his hayre,<br>
The iustest man and trewest in his dayes,<br>
Who had to wife Dame <i>Mertia</i> the fayre,<br>
A woman worthy of immortall prayse,<br>
Which for this Realme found many goodly layes,<br>
And wholesome Statutes to her husband brought;<br>
Her many deemd to haue beene of the <i>Fayes</i>,<br>
As was <i>Aegerie</i>, that <i>Numa</i> tought;<br>
Those yet of her be <i>Merti&atilde;</i> lawes both nam'd &amp; thought.<p>
 
Her sonne <i>Sisillus</i> after her did rayne,<br>
And then <i>Kimarus</i>, and then <i>Danius</i>;<br>
Next whom <i>Morindus</i> did the crowne sustaine,<br>
Who, had he not with wrath outrageous,<br>
And cruell rancour dim'd his valorous<br>
And mightie deeds, should matched haue the best:<br>
As well in that same field victorious<br>
Against the forreine <i>Morands</i> he exprest;<br>
Yet liues his memorie, though carcas sleepe in rest.<p>
 
Fiue sonnes he left begotten of one wife,<br>
All which successiuely by turnes did raine;<br>
First <i>Gorboman</i> a man of vertuous life;<br>
Next <i>Archigald</i>, who for his proud disdaine,<br>
Deposed was from Princedome soueraine,<br>
And pitteous <i>Elidure</i> put in his sted;<br>
Who shortly it to him restord againe,<br>
Till by his death he it recouered;<br>
But <i>Peridure</i> and <i>Vigent</i> him disthronized.<p>
 
In wretched prison long he did remaine,<br>
Till they outraigned had their vtmost date,<br>
And then therein reseized was againe,<br>
And ruled long with honorable state,<br>
Till he surrendred Realme and life to fate.<br>
Then all the sonnes of these fiue brethren raynd<br>
By dew successe, and all their Nephewes late,<br>
Euen thrise eleuen descents the crowne retaynd,<br>
Till aged <i>Hely</i> by dew heritage it gaynd.<p>
 
He had two sonnes, whose eldest called <i>Lud</i><br>
Left of his life most famous memory,<br>
And endlesse moniments of his great good:<br>
The ruin'd wals he did re&aelig;difye<br>
Of <i>Troynouant</i>, gainst force of enimy,<br>
And built that gate, which of his name is hight,<br>
By which he lyes entombed solemnly.<br>
He left two sonnes, too young to rule aright,<br>
<i>Androgeus</i> and <i>Tenantius</i>, pictures of his might.<p>
 
Whilst they were young, <i>Cassibalane</i> their Eme<br>
Was by the people chosen in their sted,<br>
Who on him tooke the royall Diademe,<br>
And goodly well long time it gouerned,<br>
Till the prowd <i>Romanes</i> him disquieted,<br>
And warlike <i>Caesar</i>, tempted with the name<br>
Of this sweet Island, neuer conquered,<br>
And enuying the Britons blazed fame,<br>
(O hideous hunger of dominion) hither came.<p>
 
Yet twise they were repulsed backe againe,<br>
And twise renforst, backe to their ships to fly,<br>
The whiles with bloud they all the shore did staine,<br>
And the gray <i>Ocean</i> into purple dy:<br>
Ne had they footing found at last perdie,<br>
Had not <i>Androgeus</i>, false to natiue soyle,<br>
And enuious of Vncles soueraintie,<br>
Betrayd his contrey vnto forreine spoyle:<br>
Nought else, but treason, from the first this l&atilde;d did foyle.<p>
 
So by him <i>Caesar</i> got the victory,<br>
Through great bloudshed, and many a sad assay,<br>
In which him selfe was charged heauily<br>
Of hardy <i>Nennius</i>, whom he yet did slay,<br>
But lost his sword, yet to be seene this day.<br>
Thenceforth this land was tributarie made<br>
T'ambitious <i>Rome</i>, and did their rule obay,<br>
Till <i>Arthur</i> all that reckoning did defray;<br>
Yet oft the Briton kings against them strongly swayd.<p>
 
Next him <i>Tenantius</i> raigned, then <i>Kimbeline</i>,<br>
What time th'eternall Lord in fleshly slime<br>
Enwombed was, from wretched <i>Adams</i> line<br>
To purge away the guilt of sinfull crime:<br>
O ioyous memorie of happy time,<br>
That heauenly grace so plenteously displayd;<br>
(O too high ditty for my simple rime.)<br>
Soone after this the <i>Romanes</i> him warrayd;<br>
For that their tribute he refusd to let be payd.<p>
 
Good <i>Claudius</i>, that next was Emperour,<br>
An army brought, and with him battell fought,<br>
In which the king was by a Treachetour<br>
Disguised slaine, ere any thereof thought:<br>
Yet ceased not the bloudy fight for ought;<br>
For <i>Aruirage</i> his brothers place supplide,<br>
Both in his armes, and crowne, and by that draught<br>
Did driue the <i>Romanes</i> to the weaker side,<br>
That they to peace agreed.  So all was pacifide.<p>
 
Was neuer king more highly magnifide,<br>
Nor dred of <i>Romanes</i>, then was <i>Aruirage</i>,<br>
For which the Emperour to him allide<br>
His daughter <i>Genuiss</i>' in marriage:<br>
Yet shortly he renounst the vassalage<br>
Of <i>Rome</i> againe, who hither hastly sent<br>
<i>Vespasian</i>, that with great spoile and rage<br>
Forwasted all, till <i>Genuissa</i> gent<br>
Perswaded him to ceasse, and her Lord to relent.<p>
 
He dyde; and him succeeded <i>Marius</i>,<br>
Who ioyd his dayes in great tranquillity,<br>
Then <i>Coyll</i>, and after him good <i>Lucius</i>,<br>
That first receiued Christianitie,<br>
The sacred pledge of Christes Euangely;<br>
Yet true it is, that long before that day<br>
Hither came <i>Ioseph</i> of <i>Arimathy</i>,<br>
Who brought with him the holy grayle, (they say)<br>
And preacht the truth, but since it greatly did decay.<p>
 
This good king shortly without issew dide,<br>
Whereof great trouble in the kingdome grew,<br>
That did her selfe in sundry parts diuide,<br>
And with her powre her owne selfe ouerthrew,<br>
Whilest <i>Romanes</i> dayly did the weake subdew:<br>
Which seeing stout <i>Bunduca</i>, vp arose,<br>
And taking armes, the <i>Britons</i> to her drew;<br>
With whom she marched streight against her foes,<br>
And them vnwares besides the <i>Seuerne</i> did enclose.<p>
 
There she with them a cruell battell tride,<br>
Not with so good successe, as she deseru'd;<br>
By reason that the Captaines on her side,<br>
Corrupted by <i>Paulinus</i>, from her sweru'd:<br>
Yet such, as were through former flight preseru'd,<br>
Gathering againe, her Host she did renew,<br>
And with fresh courage on the victour seru'd:<br>
But being all defeated, saue a few,<br>
Rather then fly, or be captiu'd her selfe she slew.<p>
 
O famous moniment of womens prayse,<br>
Matchable either to <i>Semiramis</i>,<br>
Whom antique history so high doth raise,<br>
Or to <i>Hypsiphil</i>' or to <i>Thomiris</i>:<br>
Her Host two hundred thousand numbred is;<br>
Who whiles good fortune fauoured her might,<br>
Triumphed oft against her enimis;<br>
And yet though ouercome in haplesse fight,<br>
She triumphed on death, in enemies despight.<p>
 
Her reliques <i>Fulgent</i> hauing gathered,<br>
Fought with <i>Seuerus</i>, and him ouerthrew;<br>
Yet in the chace was slaine of them, that fled:<br>
So made them victours, whom he did subdew.<br>
Then gan <i>Carausius</i> tirannize anew,<br>
And gainst the <i>Romanes</i> bent their proper powre,<br>
But him <i>Allectus</i> treacherously slew,<br>
And took on him the robe of Emperoure:<br>
Nath'lesse the same enioyed but short happy howre:<p>
 
For <i>Asclepiodate</i> him ouercame,<br>
And left inglorious on the vanquisht playne,<br>
Without or robe, or rag, to hide his shame.<br>
Then afterwards he in his stead did rayne;<br>
But shortly was by <i>Coyll</i> in battell slaine:<br>
Who after long debate, since <i>Lucies</i> time,<br>
Was of the <i>Britons</i> first crownd Soueraine:<br>
Then gan this Realme renewe her passed prime:<br>
He of his name <i>Coylchester</i> built of stone and lime.<p>
 
Which when the <i>Romanes</i> heard, they hither sent<br>
<i>Constantius</i>, a man of mickle might,<br>
With whom king <i>Coyll</i> made an agreement,<br>
And to him gaue for wife his daughter bright,<br>
Faire <i>Helena</i>, the fairest liuing wight;<br>
Who in all godly thewes, and goodly prayse<br>
Did far excell, but was most famous hight<br>
For skill in Musicke of all in her dayes,<br>
Aswell in curious instruments, as cunning layes.<p>
 
Of whom he did great <i>Constantine</i> beget,<br>
Who afterward was Emperour of <i>Rome</i>;<br>
To which whiles absent he his mind did set,<br>
<i>Octauius</i> here lept into his roome,<br>
And it vsurped by vnrighteous doome:<br>
But he his title iustifide by might,<br>
Slaying <i>Traherne</i>, and hauing ouercome<br>
The <i>Romane</i> legion in dreadfull fight:<br>
So settled he his kingdome, and confirmd his right.<p>
 
But wanting issew male, his daughter deare<br>
He gaue in wedlocke to <i>Maximian</i>,<br>
And him with her made of his kingdome heyre,<br>
Who soone by meanes thereof the Empire wan,<br>
Till murdred by the friends of <i>Gratian</i>;<br>
Then gan the Hunnes and Picts inuade this land,<br>
During the raigne of <i>Maximinian</i>;<br>
Who dying left none heire them to withstand,<br>
But that they ouerran all parts with easie hand.<p>
 
The weary <i>Britons</i>, whose war-hable youth<br>
Was by <i>Maximian</i> lately led away,<br>
With wretched miseries, and woefull ruth,<br>
Were to those Pagans made an open pray,<br>
And dayly spectacle of sad decay:<br>
Whom <i>Romane</i> warres, which now foure hundred yeares,<br>
And more had wasted, could no whit dismay;<br>
Till by consent of Commons and of Peares,<br>
They crownd the second <i>Constantine</i> with ioyous teares,<p>
 
Who hauing oft in battell vanquished<br>
Those spoilefull Picts, and swarming Easterlings,<br>
Long time in peace his Realme established,<br>
Yet oft annoyd with sundry bordragings<br>
Of neighbour Scots, and forrein Scatterlings,<br>
With which the world did in those dayes abound:<br>
Which to outbarre, with painefull pyonings<br>
From sea to sea he heapt a mightie mound,<br>
Which from <i>Alcluid</i> to <i>Panwelt</i> did that border bound.<p>
 
Three sonnes he dying left, all vnder age;<br>
By meanes whereof, their vncle <i>Vortigere</i><br>
Vsurpt the crowne, during their pupillage;<br>
Which th'Infants tutors gathering to feare,<br>
Them closely into <i>Armorick</i> did beare:<br>
For dread of whom, and for those Picts annoyes,<br>
He sent to <i>Germanie</i>, straunge aid to reare,<br>
From whence eftsoones arriued here three hoyes<br>
Of <i>Saxons</i>, whom he for his safetie imployes.<p>
 
Two brethren were their Capitains, which hight<br>
<i>Hengist</i> and <i>Horsus</i>, well approu'd in warre,<br>
And both of them men of renowmed might;<br>
Who making vantage of their ciuill iarre,<br>
And of those forreiners, which came from farre,<br>
Grew great, and got large portions of land,<br>
That in the Realme ere long they stronger arre,<br>
Then they which sought at first their helping hand,<br>
And <i>Vortiger</i> enforst the kingdome to aband.<p>
 
But by the helpe of <i>Vortimere</i> his sonne,<br>
He is againe vnto his rule restord,<br>
And <i>Hengist</i> seeming sad, for that was donne,<br>
Receiued is to grace and new accord,<br>
Through his faire daughters face, &amp; flattring word;<br>
Soone after which, three hundred Lordes he slew<br>
Of British bloud, all sitting at his bord;<br>
Whose dolefull moniments who list to rew,<br>
Th'eternall markes of treason may at <i>Stonheng</i> vew.<p>
 
By this the sonnes of <i>Constantine</i>, which fled,<br>
<i>Ambrose</i> and <i>Vther</i> did ripe years attaine,<br>
And here arriuing, strongly challenged<br>
The crowne, which <i>Vortiger</i> did long detaine:<br>
Who flying from his guilt, by them was slaine,<br>
And <i>Hengist</i> eke soone brought to shamefull death.<br>
Thenceforth <i>Aurelius</i> peaceably did rayne,<br>
Till that through poyson stopped was his breath;<br>
So now entombed lyes at Stoneheng by the heath.<p>
 
After him <i>Vther</i>, which <i>Pendragon</i> hight,<br>
Succeding There abruptly it did end,<br>
Without full point, or other Cesure right,<br>
As if the rest some wicked hand did rend,<br>
Or th'Authour selfe could not at least attend<br>
To finish it: that so vntimely breach<br>
The Prince him selfe halfe seemeth to offend,<br>
Yet secret pleasure did offence empeach,<br>
And wonder of antiquitie long stopt his speach.<p>
 
At last quite rauisht with delight, to heare<br>
The royall Ofspring of his natiue land,<br>
Cryde out, Deare countrey, &ocirc: how dearely deare<br>
Ought thy remembraunce, and perpetuall band<br>
Be to thy foster Childe, that from thy hand<br>
Did commun breath and nouriture receaue?<br>
How brutish is it not to vnderstand,<br>
How much to her we owe, that all vs gaue,<br>
That gaue vnto vs all, what euer good we haue.<p>
 
But <i>Guyon</i> all this while his booke did read,<br>
Ne yet has ended: for it was a great<br>
And ample volume, that doth far excead<br>
My leasure, so long leaues here to repeat:<br>
It told, how first <i>Prometheus</i> did create<br>
A man, of many partes from beasts deriued,<br>
And then stole fire from heauen, to animate<br>
His worke, for which he was by <i>Ioue</i> depriued<br>
Of life him selfe, and hart-strings of an &AElig;gle riued.<p>
 
That man so made, he called <i>Elfe</i>, to weet<br>
Quick, the first authour of all Elfin kind:<br>
Who wandring through the world with wearie feet,<br>
Did in the gardins of <i>Adonis</i> find<br>
A goodly creature, whom he deemd in mind<br>
To be no earthly wight, but either Spright,<br>
Or Angell, th'authour of all woman kind;<br>
Therefore a <i>Fay</i> he her according hight,<br>
Of whom all <i>Faeryes</i> spring, and fetch their lignage right.<p>
 
Of these a mightie people shortly grew,<br>
And puissaunt kings, which all the world warrayd,<br>
And to them selues all Nations did subdew:<br>
The first and eldest, which that scepter swayd,<br>
Was <i>Elfin</i>; him all <i>India</i> obayd,<br>
And all that now <i>America</i> men call:<br>
Next him was noble <i>Elfinan</i>, who layd<br>
<i>Cleopolis</i> foundation first of all:<br>
But <i>Elfiline</i> enclosd it with a golden wall.<p>
 
His sonne was <i>Elfinell</i>, who ouercame<br>
The wicked <i>Gobbelines</i> in bloudy field:<br>
But <i>Elfant</i> was of most renowmed fame,<br>
Who all of Christall did <i>Panthea</i> build:<br>
Then <i>Elfar</i>, who two brethren gyants kild,<br>
The one of which had two heads, th'other three:<br>
Then <i>Elfinor</i>, who was in Magick skild;<br>
He built by art vpon the glassy See<br>
A bridge of bras, whose sound heau&#7869;s thunder seem'd to bee.<p>
 
He left three sonnes, the which in order raynd,<br>
And all their Ofspring, in their dew descents,<br>
Euen seuen hundred Princes, which maintaynd<br>
With mightie deedes their sundry gouernments;<br>
That were too long their infinite contents<br>
Here to record, ne much materiall:<br>
Yet should they be most famous moniments,<br>
And braue ensample, both of martiall,<br>
And ciuill rule to kings and states imperiall.<p>
 
After all these <i>Elficleos</i> did rayne,<br>
The wise <i>Elficleos</i> in great Maiestie,<br>
Who mightily that scepter did sustayne,<br>
And with rich spoiles and famous victorie,<br>
Did high aduaunce the crowne of <i>Faery</i>:<br>
He left two sonnes, of which faire <i>Elferon</i><br>
The eldest brother did vntimely dy;<br>
Whose emptie place the mightie <i>Oberon</i><br>
Doubly supplide, in spousall, and dominion.<p>
 
Great was his power and glorie ouer all,<br>
Which him before, that sacred seate did fill,<br>
That yet remaines his wide memoriall:<br>
He dying left the fairest <i>Tanaquill</i>,<br>
Him to succeede therein, by his last will:<br>
Fairer and nobler liueth none this howre,<br>
Ne like in grace, ne like in learned skill;<br>
Therefore they <i>Glorian</i> call that glorious flowre,<br>
Long mayst thou <i>Glorian</i> liue, in glory and great powre.<p>
 
Beguild thus with delight of nouelties,<br>
And naturall desire of countreys state,<br>
So long they red in those antiquities,<br>
That how the time was fled, they quite forgate,<br>
Till gentle <i>Alma</i> seeing it so late,<br>
Perforce their studies broke, and them besought<br>
To thinke, how supper did them long awaite.<br>
So halfe vnwilling from their bookes them brought,<br>
And fairely feasted, as so noble knights she ought.<p>
