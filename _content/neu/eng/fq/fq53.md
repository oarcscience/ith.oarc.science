*Canto I.*

> *Artegall trayn'd in Iustice lore  
> Irenaes quest pursewed,  
> He doeth auenge on Sanglier  
> His Ladies bloud embrewed.*

> T Hough vertue then were held in highest price,  
> In those old times, of which I doe intreat,  
> Yet then likewise the wicked seede of vice  
> Began to spring which shortly grew full great,  
> And with their boughes the gentle plants did beat.  
> But euermore some of the vertuous race  
> Rose vp, inspired with heroicke heat,  
> That cropt the branches of the sient base,  
> And with strong hand their fruitfull rancknes did deface.
>
> Such first was *Bacchus*, that with furious might  
> All th'East before vntam'd did ouerronne,  
> And wrong repressed, and establisht right,  
> Which lawlesse men had formerly fordonne.  
> There Iustice first her princely rule begonne.  
> Next *Hercules* his like ensample shewed,  
> Who all the West with equall conquest wonne,  
> And monstrous tyrants with his club subdewed;  
> The club of Iustice dread, with kingly powre endewed.
>
> And such was he, of whom I haue to tell,  
> The Champion of true Iustice *Artegall*.  
> Whom (as ye lately mote remember well)  
> An hard aduenture, which did then befall,  
> Into redoubted perill forth did call;  
> That was to succour a distressed Dame,  
> Whom a strong tyrant did vniustly thrall,  
> And from the heritage, which she did clame,  
> Did with strong hand withhold: *Grantorto* was his name.
>
> Wherefore the Lady, which *Eirena* hight,  
> Did to the Faery Queene her way addresse,  
> To whom complayning her afflicted plight,  
> She her besought of gratious redresse.  
> That soueraine Queene, that mightie Emperesse,  
> Whose glorie is to aide all suppliants pore,  
> And of weake Princes to be Patronesse,  
> Chose *Artegall* to right her to restore;  
> For that to her he seem'd best skild in righteous lore.
>
> For *Artegall* in iustice was vpbrought  
> Euen from the cradle of his infancie,  
> And all the depth of rightfull doome was taught  
> By faire *Astræa*, with great industrie,  
> Whilest here on earth she liued mortallie.  
> For till the world from his perfection fell  
> Into all filth and foule iniquitie,  
> *Astræa* here mongst earthly men did dwell,  
> And in the rules of iustice them instructed well.
>
> Whiles through the world she walked in this sort,  
> Vpon a day she found this gentle childe,  
> Amongst his peres playing his childish sport:  
> Whom seeing fit, and with no crime defilde,  
> She did allure with gifts and speaches milde,  
> To wend with her. So thence him farre she brought  
> Into a caue from companie exilde,  
> In which she noursled him, till yeares he raught,  
> And all the discipline of iustice there him taught.
>
> There she him taught to weigh both right and wrong  
> In equall ballance with due recompence,  
> And equitie to measure out along,  
> According to the line of conscience,  
> When so it needs with rigour to dispence.  
> Of all the which, for want there of mankind,  
> She caused him to make experience  
> Vpon wyld beasts, which she in woods did find,  
> With wrongfull powre oppressing others of their kind.
>
> Thus she him trayned, and thus she him taught,  
> In all the skill of deeming wrong and right,  
> Vntill the ripenesse of mans yeares he raught;  
> That euen wilde beasts did feare his awfull sight,  
> And men admyr'd his ouerruling might;  
> Ne any liu'd on ground, that durst withstand  
> His dreadfull heast, much lesse him match in fight,  
> Or bide the horror of his wreakfull hand,  
> When so he list in wrath lift vp his steely brand.
>
> Which steely brand, to make him dreaded more,  
> She gaue vnto him, gotten by her slight  
> And earnest search, where it was kept in store  
> In *Ioues* eternall house, vnwist of wight,  
> Since he himselfe it vs'd in that great fight  
> Against the *Titans*, that whylome rebelled  
> Gainst highest heauen; *Chrysaor* it was hight;  
> *Chrysaor* that all other swords excelled,  
> Well prou'd in that same day, when *Ioue* those Gyants quelled.
>
> For of most perfect metall it was made,  
> Tempred with Adamant amongst the same,  
> And garnisht all with gold vpon the blade  
> In goodly wise, whereof it tooke his name,  
> And was of no lesse vertue, then of fame.  
> For there no substance was so firme and hard,  
> But it would pierce or cleaue, where so it came;  
> Ne any armour could his dint out ward,  
> But wheresoeuer it did light, it throughly shard.
>
> Now when the world with sinne gan to abound,  
> *Astraea* loathing lenger here to space  
> Mongst wicked men, in whom no truth she found,  
> Return'd to heauen, whence she deriu'd her race;  
> Where she hath now an euerlasting place,  
> Mongst those twelue signes, which nightly we doe see  
> The heauens bright-shining baudricke to enchace;  
> And is the *Virgin*, sixt in her degree,  
> And next her selfe her righteous ballance hanging bee.
>
> But when she parted hence, she left her groome  
> An yron man, which did on her attend  
> Alwayes, to execute her stedfast doome,  
> And willed him with *Artegall* to wend,  
> And doe what euer thing he did intend.  
> His name was *Talus*, made of yron mould,  
> Immoueable, resistlesse, without end.  
> Who in his hand an yron flale did hould,  
> With which he thresht out falshood, and did truth vnfould.
>
> He now went with him in this new inquest,  
> Him for to aide, if aide he chaunst to neede,  
> Against that cruell Tyrant, which opprest  
> The faire *Irena* with his foule misdeede,  
> And kept the crowne in which she should succeed.  
> And now together on their way they bin,  
> When as they saw a Squire in squallid weed,  
> Lamenting sore his sorowfull sad tyne,  
> With many bitter teares shed from his blubbred eyne.
>
> To whom as they approched, they espide  
> A sorie sight, as euer seene with eye;  
> An headlesse Ladie lying him beside,  
> In her owne blood all wallow'd wofully,  
> That her gay clothes did in discolour die.  
> Much was he moued at that ruefull sight;  
> And flam'd with zeale of vengeance inwardly,  
> He askt, who had that Dame so fouly dight;  
> Or whether his owne hand, or whether other wight?
>
> Ah woe is me, and well away (quoth hee)  
> Bursting forth teares, like springs out of a banke,  
> That euer I this dismall day did see:  
> Full farre was I from thinking such a pranke;  
> Yet litle losse it were, and mickle thanke,  
> If I should graunt that I haue doen the same,  
> That I mote drinke the cup, whereof she dranke:  
> But that I should die guiltie of the blame,  
> The which another did, who now is fled with shame.
>
> Who was it then (sayd *Artegall*) that wrought?  
> And why? doe it declare vnto me trew.  
> A knight (said he) if knight he may be thought,  
> That did his hand in Ladies bloud embrew,  
> And for no cause, but as I shall you shew.  
> This day as I in solace sate hereby  
> With a fayre loue, whose losse I now do rew,  
> There came this knight, hauing in companie  
> This lucklesse Ladie, which now here doth headlesse lie.
>
> He, whether mine seem'd fayrer in his eye,  
> Or that he wexed weary of his owne,  
> Would change with me; but I did it denye;  
> So did the Ladies both, as may be knowne,  
> But he, whose spirit was with pride vpblowne,  
> Would not so rest contented with his right,  
> But hauing from his courser her downe throwne,  
> Fro me reft mine away by lawlesse might,  
> And on his steed her set, to beare her out of sight.
>
> Which when his Ladie saw, she follow'd fast,  
> And on him catching hold, gan loud to crie  
> Not so to leaue her, nor away to cast,  
> But rather of his hand besought to die.  
> With that his sword he drew all wrathfully,  
> And at one stroke cropt off her head with scorne,  
> In that same place, whereas it now doth lie.  
> So he my loue away with him hath borne,  
> And left me here, both his & mine owne loue to morne.
>
> Aread (sayd he) which way then did he make?  
> And by what markes may he be knowne againe?  
> To hope (quoth he) him soone to ouertake,  
> That hence so long departed, is but vaine:  
> But yet he pricked ouer yonder plaine,  
> And as I marked, bore vpon his shield,  
> By which it's easie him to know againe,  
> A broken sword within a bloodie field;  
> Expressing well his nature, which the same did wield.
>
> No sooner sayd, but streight he after sent  
> His yron page, who him pursew'd so light,  
> As that it seem'd aboue the ground he went:  
> For he was swift as swallow in her flight,  
> And strong as Lyon in his Lordly might.  
> It was not long, before he ouertooke  
> Sir *Sanglier*; (so cleeped was that Knight)  
> Whom at the first he ghessed by his looke,  
> And by the other markes, which of his shield he tooke.
>
> He bad him stay, and backe with him retire;  
> Who full of scorne to be commaunded so,  
> The Lady to alight did eft require,  
> Whilest he reformed that vnciuill fo:  
> And streight at him with all his force did go.  
> Who mou'd no more therewith, then when a rocke  
> Is lightly stricken with some stones throw;  
> But tlo him leaping, len him such a knocke,  
> That on the ground he layd him like a sencelesse blocke.
>
> But ere he could him selfe recure againe,  
> Him in his iron paw he seized had;  
> That when he wak't out of his warelesse paine,  
> He found him selfe, vnwist, so ill bestad,  
> That lim he could not wag. Thence he him lad,  
> Bound like a beast appointed to the stall:  
> The sight whereof the Lady sore adrad,  
> And fain'd to fly for feare of being thrall;  
> But he her quickly stayd, and forst to wend withall.
>
> When to the place they came, where *Artegall*  
> By that same carefull Squire did then abide,  
> He gently gan him to demaund of all,  
> That did betwixt him and that Squire betide.  
> Who with sterne countenance and indignant pride  
> Did aunswere, that of all he guiltlesse stood,  
> And his accuser thereuppon defide:  
> For neither he did shed that Ladies bloud,  
> Nor tooke away his loue, but his owne proper good.
>
> Well did the Squire perceiue him selfe too weake,  
> To aunswere his defiaunce in the field,  
> And rather chose his challenge off to breake,  
> Then to approue his right with speare and shield.  
> And rather guilty chose him selfe to yield.  
> But *Artegall* by signes perceiuing plaine,  
> That he it was not, which that Lady kild,  
> But that strange Knight, the fairer loue to gaine,  
> Did cast about by sleight the truth thereout to straine.
>
> And sayd, Now sure this doubtfull causes right  
> Can hardly but by Sacrament be tride,  
> Or else by ordele, or by blooddy fight;  
> That ill perhaps mote fall to either side.  
> But if ye please, that I your cause decide,  
> Perhaps I may all further quarrell end,  
> So ye will sweare my iudgement to abide.  
> Thereto they both did franckly condiscend,  
> And to his doome with listfull eares did both attend.
>
> Sith then (sayd he) ye both the dead deny,  
> And both the liuing Lady claime your right,  
> Let both the dead and liuing equally  
> Deuided be betwixt you here in sight,  
> And each of either take his share aright.  
> But looke who does dissent from this my read,  
> He for a twelue moneths day shall in despight  
> Beare for his penaunce that same Ladies head;  
> To witnesse to the world, that she by him is dead.
>
> Well pleased with that doome was *Sangliere*,  
> And offred streight the Lady to be slaine.  
> But that same Squire, to whom she was more dere,  
> When as he saw she should be cut in twaine,  
> Did yield, she rather should with him remaine  
> Aliue, then to him selfe be shared dead;  
> And rather then his loue should suffer paine,  
> He chose with shame to beare that Ladies head  
> True loue despiseth shame, when life is cald in dread.
>
> Whom when so willing *Artegall* perceaued;  
> Not so thou Squire, (he sayd) but thine I deeme  
> The liuing Lady, which from thee he reaued:  
> For worthy thou of her doest rightly seeme.  
> And you, Sir Knight, that loue so light esteeme,  
> As that ye would for little leaue the same,  
> Take here your owne, that doth you best beseeme,  
> And with it beare the burden of defame;  
> Your owne dead Ladies head, to tell abrode your shame.
>
> But *Sangliere* disdained much his doome,  
> And sternly gan repine at his beheast;  
> Ne would for ought obay, as did become,  
> To beare that Ladies head before his breast.  
> Vntill that *Talus* had his pride represt,  
> And forced him, maulgre, it vp to reare.  
> Who when he saw it bootelesse to resist,  
> He tooke it vp, and thence with him did beare,  
> As rated Spaniell takes his burden vp for feare.
>
> Much did that Squire Sir *Artegall* adore,  
> For his great iustice, held in high regard;  
> And as his Squire him offred euermore  
> To serue, for want of other meete reward,  
> And wend with him on his aduenture hard.  
> But he thereto would by no meanes consent;  
> But leauing him forth on his iourney far'd:  
> Ne wight with him but onely *Talus* went.  
> They two enough t'encounter an whole Regiment.
