<blockquote> 
 
 
<i>Her faithfull knight faire Vna brings<br>  
to house of Holinesse,<br> 
Where he is taught repentance, and<br>  
the way to heauenly blesse. </i><p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>
<blockquote>     
WHat man is he, that boasts of fleshly 
might,<br>
And vaine assurance of mortality,<br>
Which all so soone, as it doth come to fight,<br>
Against spirituall foes, yeelds by and by,<br>
Or from the field most cowardly doth fly?<br>
Ne let the man ascribe it to his skill,<br>
That thorough grace hath gained victory.<br>
If any strength we haue, it is to ill,<br>
But all the good is Gods, both power and eke will.<p>
 
By that, which lately hapned, <i>Vna</i> saw,<br>
That this her knight was feeble, and too faint;<br>
And all his sinews woxen weake and raw,<br>
Through long enprisonment, and hard constraint,<br>
Which he endured in his late restraint,<br>
That yet he was vnfit for bloudie fight:<br>
Therefore to cherish him with diets daint,<br>
She cast to bring him, where he chearen might,<br>
Till he recouered had his late decayed plight.<p>
 
There was an auntient house not farre away,<br>
Renowmd throughout the world for sacred lore,<br>
And pure vnspotted life: so well they say<br>
It gouernd was, and guided euermore,<br>
Through wisedome of a matrone graue and hore;<br>
Whose onely ioy was to relieue the needes<br>
Of wretched soules, and helpe the helpelesse pore:<br>
All night she spent in bidding of her bedes,<br>
And all the day in doing good and godly deedes.<p>
 
Dame <i>C&aelig;lia</i> men did her call, as thought<br>
From heauen to come, or thither to arise,<br>
The mother of three daughters, well vpbrought<br>
In goodly thewes, and godly exercise:<br>
The eldest two most sober, chast, and wise,<br>
<i>Fidelia</i> and <i>Speranza</i> virgins were,<br>
Though spousd, yet wanting wedlocks solemnize;<br>
But faire <i>Charissa</i> to a louely fere<br>
Was lincked, and by him had many pledges dere.<p>
 
Arriued there, the dore they find fast lockt;<br>
For it was warely watched night and day,<br>
For feare of many foes: but when they knockt,<br>
The Porter opened vnto them streight way:<br>
He was an aged syre, all hory gray,<br>
With lookes full lowly cast, and gate full slow,<br>
Wont on a staffe his feeble steps to stay,<br>
Hight <i>Humilt&aacute;</i>. They passe in stouping low;<br>
For streight &amp; narrow was the way, which he did show.<p>
 
Each goodly thing is hardest to begin,<br>
But entred in a spacious court they see,<br>
Both plaine, and pleasant to be walked in,<br>
Where them does meete a francklin faire and free,<br>
And entertaines with comely courteous glee,<br>
His name was <i>Zele</i>, that him right well became,<br>
For in his speeches and behauiour hee<br>
Did labour liuely to expresse the same,<br>
And gladly did them guide, till to the Hall they came.<p>
 
There fairely them receiues a gentle Squire,<br>
Of milde demeanure, and rare courtesie,<br>
Right cleanly clad in comely sad attire;<br>
In word and deede that shew'd great modestie,<br>
And knew his good to all of each degree,<br>
Hight <i>Reuerence</i>. He them with speeches meet<br>
Does faire entreat; no courting nicetie,<br>
But simple true, and eke vnfained sweet,<br>
As might become a Squire so great persons to greet.<p>
 
And afterwards them to his Dame he leades,<br>
That aged Dame, the Ladie of the place:<br>
Who all this while was busie at her beades:<br>
Which doen, she vp arose with seemely grace,<br>
And toward them full matronely did pace.<br>
Where when that fairest <i>Vna</i> she beheld,<br>
Whom well she knew to spring from heauenly race,<br>
Her hart with ioy vnwonted inly sweld,<br>
As feeling wondrous comfort in her weaker eld.<p>
 
And her embracing said, &ocirc; happie earth,<br>
Whereon thy innocent feet doe euer tread,<br>
Most vertuous virgin borne of heauenly berth,<br>
That to redeeme thy woefull parents head,<br>
From tyrans rage, and euer-dying dread,<br>
Hast wandred through the world now long a day;<br>
Yet ceasest not thy wearie soles to lead,<br>
What grace hath thee now hither brought this way?<br>
Or doen thy feeble feet vnweeting hither stray?<p>
 
Strange thing it is an errant knight to see<br>
Here in this place, or any other wight,<br>
That hither turnes his steps. So few there bee,<br>
That chose the narrow path, or seeke the right:<br>
All keepe the broad high way, and take delight<br>
With many rather for to go astray,<br>
And be partakers of their euill plight,<br>
Then with a few to walke the rightest way;<br>
O foolish men, why haste ye to your owne decay?<p>
 
Thy selfe to see, and tyred limbs to rest,<br>
O matrone sage (quoth she) I hither came,<br>
And this good knight his way with me addrest,<br>
Led with thy prayses and broad-blazed fame,<br>
That vp to heauen is blowne. The auncient Dame<br>
Him goodly greeted in her modest guise,<br>
And entertaynd them both, as best became,<br>
With all the court'sies, that she could deuise.<br>
Ne wanted ought, to shew her bounteous or wise.<p>
 
Thus as they gan of sundry things deuise,<br>
Loe two most goodly virgins came in place,<br>
Ylinked arme in arme in louely wise,<br>
With countenance demure, and modest grace,<br>
They numberd euen steps and equall pace:<br>
Of which the eldest, that <i>Fidelia</i> hight,<br>
Like sunny beames threw from her Christall face,<br>
That could haue dazd the rash beholders sight,<br>
And round about her head did shine like heauens light.<p>
 
She was araied all in lilly white,<br>
And in her right hand bore a cup of gold,<br>
With wine and water fild vp to the hight,<br>
In which a Serpent did himselfe enfold,<br>
That horrour made to all, that did behold;<br>
But she no whit did chaunge her constant mood:<br>
And in her other hand she fast did hold<br>
A booke, that was both signd and seald with blood,<br>
Wherein darke things were writ, hard to be vnderstood.<p>
 
Her younger sister, that <i>Speranza</i> hight,<br>
Was clad in blew, that her beseemed well;<br>
Not all so chearefull seemed she of sight,<br>
As was her sister; whether dread did dwell,<br>
Or anguish in her hart, is hard to tell:<br>
Vpon her arme a siluer anchor lay,<br>
Whereon she leaned euer, as befell:<br>
And euer vp to heauen, as she did pray,<br>
Her stedfast eyes were bent, ne swarued other way.<p>
 
They seeing <i>Vna</i>, towards her gan wend,<br>
Who them encounters with like courtesie;<br>
Many kind speeches they betwene them spend,<br>
And greatly ioy each other well to see:<br>
Then to the knight with shamefast modestie<br>
They turne themselues, at <i>Vnaes</i> meeke request,<br>
And him salute with well beseeming glee:<br>
Who faire them quites, as him beseemed best,<br>
And goodly gan discourse of many a noble gest.<p>
 
Then <i>Vna</i> thus; But she your sister deare;<br>
The deare <i>Charissa</i> where is she become?<br>
Or wants she health, or busie is elsewhere?<br>
Ah no, said they, but forth she may not come:<br>
For she of late is lightned of her wombe,<br>
And hath encreast the world with one sonne more,<br>
That her to see should be but troublesome.<br>
Indeede (quoth she) that should her trouble sore,<br>
But thankt be God, and her encrease so euermore.<p>
 
Then said the aged <i>Coelia</i>, Deare dame,<br>
And you good Sir, I wote that of your toyle,<br>
And labours long, through which ye hither came,<br>
Ye both forwearied be: therefore a whyle<br>
I read you rest, and to your bowres recoyle.<br>
Then called she a Groome, that forth him led<br>
Into a goodly lodge, and gan despoile<br>
Of puissant armes, and laid in easie bed;<br>
His name was meeke <i>Obedience</i> rightfully ared.<p>
 
Now when their wearie limbes with kindly rest,<br>
And bodies were refresht with due repast,<br>
Faire <i>Vna</i> gan <i>Fidelia</i> faire request,<br>
To haue her knight into her schoolehouse plaste,<br>
That of her heauenly learning he might taste,<br>
And heare the wisedome of her words diuine.<br>
She graunted, and that knight so much agraste,<br>
That she him taught celestiall discipline,<br>
And opened his dull eyes, that light mote in them shine.<p>
 
And that her sacred Booke, with bloud ywrit,<br>
That none could read, except she did them teach,<br>
She vnto him disclosed euery whit,<br>
And heauenly documents thereout did preach,<br>
That weaker wit of man could neuer reach,<br>
Of God, of grace, of iustice, of free will,<br>
That wonder was to heare her goodly speach:<br>
For she was able, with her words to kill,<br>
And raise againe to life the hart, that she did thrill.<p>
 
And when she list poure out her larger spright,<br>
She would commaund the hastie Sunne to stay,<br>
Or backward turne his course from heauens hight;<br>
Sometimes great hostes of men she could dismay,<br>
Dry-shod to passe, she parts the flouds in tway;<br>
And eke huge mountaines from their natiue seat<br>
She would commaund, themselues to beare away,<br>
And throw in raging sea with roaring threat.<br>
Almightie God her gaue such powre, and puissance great.<p>
 
The faithfull knight now grew in litle space,<br>
By hearing her, and by her sisters lore,<br>
To such perfection of all heauenly grace,<br>
That wretched world he gan for to abhore,<br>
And mortall life gan loath, as thing forlore,<br>
Greeu'd with remembrance of his wicked wayes,<br>
And prickt with anguish of his sinnes so sore,<br>
That he desirde to end his wretched dayes:<br>
So much the dart of sinfull guilt the soule dismayes.<p>
 
But wise <i>Speranza</i> gaue him comfort sweet,<br>
And taught him how to take assured hold<br>
Vpon her siluer anchor, as was meet;<br>
Else had his sinnes so great, and manifold<br>
Made him forget all that <i>Fidelia</i> told.<br>
In this distressed doubtfull agonie,<br>
When him his dearest <i>Vna</i> did behold,<br>
Disdeining life, desiring leaue to die,<br>
She found her selfe assayld with great perplexitie.<p>
 
And came to <i>Coelia</i> to declare her smart,<br>
Who well acquainted with that commune plight,<br>
Which sinfull horror workes in wounded hart,<br>
Her wisely comforted all that she might,<br>
With goodly counsell and aduisement right;<br>
And streightway sent with carefull diligence,<br>
To fetch a Leach, the which had great insight<br>
In that disease of grieued conscience,<br>
And well could cure the same; His name was <i>Patience</i>.<p>
 
Who comming to that soule-diseased knight,<br>
Could hardly him intreat, to tell his griefe:<br>
Which knowne, and all that noyd his heauie spright<br>
Well searcht, eftsoones he gan apply reliefe<br>
Of salues and med'cines, which had passing priefe,<br>
And thereto added words of wondrous might:<br>
By which to ease he him recured briefe,<br>
And much asswag'd the passion of his plight,<br>
That he his paine endur'd, as seeming now more light.<p>
 
But yet the cause and root of all his ill,<br>
Inward corruption, and infected sin,<br>
Not purg'd nor heald, behind remained still,<br>
And festring sore did rankle yet within,<br>
Close creeping twixt the marrow and the skin.<br>
Which to extirpe, he laid him priuily<br>
Downe in a darkesome lowly place farre in,<br>
Whereas he meant his corrosiues to apply,<br>
And with streight diet tame his stubborne malady.<p>
 
In ashes and sackcloth he did array<br>
His daintie corse, proud humors to abate,<br>
And dieted with fasting euery day,<br>
The swelling of his wounds to mitigate,<br>
And made him pray both earely and eke late:<br>
And euer as superfluous flesh did rot<br>
<i>Amendment</i> readie still at hand did wayt,<br>
To pluck it out with pincers firie whot,<br>
That soone in him was left no one corrupted iot.<p>
 
And bitter <i>Penance</i> with an yron whip,<br>
Was wont him once to disple euery day:<br>
And sharpe <i>Remorse</i> his hart did pricke and nip,<br>
That drops of bloud thence like a well did play;<br>
And sad <i>Repentance</i> vsed to embay<br>
His bodie in salt water smarting sore,<br>
The filthy blots of sinne to wash away.<br>
So in short space they did to health restore<br>
The man that would not liue, but earst lay at deathes dore.<p>
 
In which his torment often was so great,<br>
That like a Lyon he would cry and rore,<br>
And rend his flesh, and his owne synewes eat.<br>
His owne deare <i>Vna</i> hearing euermore<br>
His ruefull shriekes and gronings, often tore<br>
Her guiltlesse garments, and her golden heare,<br>
For pitty of his paine and anguish sore;<br>
Yet all with patience wisely she did beare;<br>
For well she wist, his crime could else be neuer cleare.<p>
 
Whom thus recouer'd by wise Patience,<br>
And trew <i>Repentance</i> they to <i>Vna</i> brought:<br>
Who ioyous of his cured conscience,<br>
Him dearely kist, and fairely eke besought<br>
Himselfe to chearish, and consuming thought<br>
To put away out of his carefull brest.<br>
By this <i>Charissa</i>, late in child-bed brought,<br>
Was woxen strong, and left her fruitfull nest;<br>
To her faire <i>Vna</i> brought this vnacquainted guest.<p>
 
She was a woman in her freshest age,<br>
Of wondrous beauty, and of bountie rare,<br>
With goodly grace and comely personage,<br>
That was on earth not easie to compare;<br>
Full of great loue, but <i>Cupids</i> wanton snare<br>
As hell she hated, chast in worke and will;<br>
Her necke and breasts were euer open bare,<br>
That ay thereof her babes might sucke their fill;<br>
The rest was all in yellow robes arayed still.<p>
 
A multitude of babes about her hong,<br>
Playing their sports, that ioyd her to behold,<br>
Whom still she fed, whiles they were weake &amp; young,<br>
But thrust them forth still, as they wexed old:<br>
And on her head she wore a tyre of gold,<br>
Adornd with gemmes and owches wondrous faire,<br>
Whose passing price vneath was to be told;<br>
And by her side there sate a gentle paire<br>
Of turtle doues, she sitting in an yuorie chaire.<p>
 
The knight and <i>Vna</i> entring, faire her greet,<br>
And bid her ioy of that her happie brood;<br>
Who them requites with court'sies seeming meet,<br>
And entertaines with friendly chearefull mood.<br>
Then <i>Vna</i> her besought, to be so good,<br>
As in her vertuous rules to schoole her knight,<br>
Now after all his torment well withstood,<br>
In that sad house of <i>Penaunce</i>, where his spright<br>
Had past the paines of hell, and long enduring night.<p>
 
She was right ioyous of her iust request,<br>
And taking by the hand that Faeries sonne,<br>
Gan him instruct in euery good behest,<br>
Of loue, and righteousnesse, and well to donne,<br>
And wrath, and hatred warely to shonne,<br>
That drew on men Gods hatred, and his wrath,<br>
And many soules in dolours had fordonne:<br>
In which when him she well instructed hath,<br>
From thence to heauen she teacheth him the ready path.<p>
 
Wherein his weaker wandring steps to guide,<br>
An auncient matrone she to her does call,<br>
Whose sober lookes her wisedome well descride:<br>
Her name was <i>Mercie</i>, well knowne ouer all,<br>
To be both gratious, and eke liberall:<br>
To whom the carefull charge of him she gaue,<br>
To lead aright, that he should neuer fall<br>
In all his wayes through this wide worldes waue,<br>
That Mercy in the end his righteous soule might saue.<p>
 
The godly Matrone by the hand him beares<br>
Forth from her presence, by a narrow way,<br>
Scattred with bushy thornes, and ragged breares,<br>
Which still before him she remou'd away,<br>
That nothing might his ready passage stay:<br>
And euer when his feet encombred were,<br>
Or gan to shrinke, or from the right to stray,<br>
She held him fast, and firmely did vpbeare,<br>
As carefull Nourse her child from falling oft does reare.<p>
 
Eftsoones vnto an holy Hospitall,<br>
That was fore by the way, she did him bring,<br>
In which seuen Bead-men that had vowed all<br>
Their life to seruice of high heauens king<br>
Did spend their dayes in doing godly thing:<br>
Their gates to all were open euermore,<br>
That by the wearie way were traueiling,<br>
And one sate wayting euer them before,<br>
To call in-commers by, that needy were and pore.<p>
 
The first of them that eldest was, and best,<br>
Of all the house had charge and gouernement,<br>
As Guardian and Steward of the rest:<br>
His office was to giue entertainement<br>
And lodging, vnto all that came, and went:<br>
Not vnto such, as could him feast againe,<br>
And double quite, for that he on them spent,<br>
But such, as want of harbour did constraine:<br>
Those for Gods sake his dewty was to entertaine.<p>
 
The second was as Almner of the place,<br>
His office was, the hungry for to feed,<br>
And thristy giue to drinke, a worke of grace:<br>
He feard not once him selfe to be in need,<br>
Ne car'd to hoord for those, whom he did breede:<br>
The grace of God he layd vp still in store,<br>
Which as a stocke he left vnto his seede;<br>
He had enough, what need him care for more?<br>
And had he lesse, yet some he would giue to the pore.<p>
 
The third had of their wardrobe custodie,<br>
In which were not rich tyres, nor garments gay,<br>
The plumes of pride, and wings of vanitie,<br>
But clothes meet to keepe keene could away,<br>
And naked nature seemely to aray;<br>
With which bare wretched wights he dayly clad,<br>
The images of God in earthly clay;<br>
And if that no spare cloths to giue he had,<br>
His owne coate he would cut, and it distribute glad.<p>
 
The fourth appointed by his office was,<br>
Poore prisoners to relieue with gratious ayd,<br>
And captiues to redeeme with price of bras,<br>
From Turkes and Sarazins, which them had stayd;<br>
And though they faultie were, yet well he wayd,<br>
That God to vs forgiueth euery howre<br>
Much more then that, why they in bands were layd,<br>
And he that harrowd hell with heauie stowre,<br>
The faultie soules from thence brought to his heauenly bowre.<p>
 
The fift had charge sicke persons to attend,<br>
And comfort those, in point of death which lay;<br>
For them most needeth comfort in the end,<br>
When sin, and hell, and death do most dismay<br>
The feeble soule departing hence away.<br>
All is but lost, that liuing we bestow,<br>
If not well ended at our dying day.<br>
O man haue mind of that last bitter throw;<br>
For as the tree does fall, so lyes it euer low.<p>
 
The sixt had charge of them now being dead,<br>
In seemely sort their corses to engraue,<br>
And deck with dainty flowres their bridall bed,<br>
That to their heauenly spouse both sweet and braue<br>
They might appeare, when he their soules shall saue.<br>
The wondrous workemanship of Gods owne mould,<br>
Whose face he made, all beasts to feare, and gaue<br>
All in his hand, euen dead we honour should.<br>
Ah dearest God me graunt, I dead be not defould.<p>
 
The seuenth now after death and buriall done,<br>
Had charge the tender Orphans of the dead<br>
And widowes ayd, least they should be vndone:<br>
In face of iudgement he their right would plead,<br>
Ne ought the powre of mighty men did dread<br>
In their defence, nor would for gold or fee<br>
Be wonne their rightfull causes downe to tread:<br>
And when they stood in most necessitee,<br>
He did supply their want, and gaue them euer free.<p>
 
There when the Elfin knight arriued was,<br>
The first and chiefest of the seuen, whose care<br>
Was guests to welcome, towardes him did pas:<br>
Where seeing <i>Mercie</i>, that his steps vp bare,<br>
And alwayes led, to her with reuerence rare<br>
He humbly louted in meeke lowlinesse,<br>
And seemely welcome for her did prepare:<br>
For of their order she was Patronesse,<br>
Albe <i>Charissa</i> were their chiefest founderesse.<p>
 
There she awhile him stayes, him selfe to rest,<br>
That to the rest more able he might bee:<br>
During which time, in euery good behest<br>
And godly worke of Almes and charitee<br>
She him instructed with great industree;<br>
Shortly therein so perfect he became,<br>
That from the first vnto the last degree,<br>
His mortall life he learned had to frame<br>
In holy righteousnesse, without rebuke or blame.<p>
 
Thence forward by that painfull way they pas,<br>
Forth to an hill, that was both steepe and hy;<br>
On top whereof a sacred chappell was,<br>
And eke a litle Hermitage thereby,<br>
Wherein an aged holy man did lye,<br>
That day and night said his deuotion,<br>
Ne other worldly busines did apply;<br>
His name was heauenly <i>Contemplation</i>;<br>
Of God and goodnesse was his meditation.<p>
 
Great grace that old man to him giuen had;<br>
For God he often saw from heauens hight,<br>
All were his earthly eyen both blunt and bad,<br>
And through great age had lost their kindly sight,<br>
Yet wondrous quick and persant was his spright,<br>
As Eagles eye, that can behold the Sunne:<br>
That hill they scale with all their powre and might,<br>
That his frayle thighes nigh wearie and fordonne<br>
Gan faile, but by her helpe the top at last he wonne.<p>
 
There they do finde that godly aged Sire,<br>
With snowy lockes adowne his shoulders shed,<br>
As hoarie frost with spangles doth attire<br>
The mossy braunches of an Oke halfe ded.<br>
Each bone might through his body well be red,<br>
And euery sinew seene through his long fast:<br>
For nought he car'd his carcas long vnfed;<br>
His mind was full of spirituall repast,<br>
And pyn'd his flesh, to keepe his body low and chast.<p>
 
Who when these two approching he aspide,<br>
At their first presence grew agrieued sore,<br>
That forst him lay his heauenly thoughts aside;<br>
And had he not that Dame respected more,<br>
Whom highly he did reuerence and adore,<br>
He would not once haue moued for the knight.<br>
They him saluted standing far afore;<br>
Who well them greeting, humbly did requight,<br>
And asked, to what end they clomb that tedious height.<p>
 
What end (quoth she) should cause vs take such paine,<br>
But that same end, which euery liuing wight<br>
Should make his marke, high heauen to attaine?<br>
Is not from hence the way, that leadeth right<br>
To that most glorious house, that glistreth bright<br>
With burning starres, and euerliuing fire,<br>
Whereof the keyes are to thy hand behight<br>
By wise <i>Fidelia</i>? she doth thee require,<br>
To shew it to this knight, according his desire.<p>
 
Thrise happy man, said then the father graue,<br>
Whose staggering steps thy steady hand doth lead,<br>
And shewes the way, his sinfull soule to saue.<br>
Who better can the way to heauen aread,<br>
Then thou thy selfe, that was both borne and bred<br>
In heauenly throne, where thousand Angels shine?<br>
Thou doest the prayers of the righteous sead<br>
Present before the maiestie diuine,<br>
And his auenging wrath to clemencie incline.<p>
 
Yet since thou bidst, thy pleasure shalbe donne.<br>
Then come thou man of earth, and see the way,<br>
That neuer yet was seene of Faeries sonne,<br>
That neuer leads the traueiler astray,<br>
But after labours long, and sad delay,<br>
Brings them to ioyous rest and endlesse blis.<br>
But first thou must a season fast and pray,<br>
Till from her bands the spright assoiled is,<br>
And haue her strength recur'd from fraile infirmitis.<p>
 
That done, he leads him to the highest Mount;<br>
Such one, as that same mighty man of God,<br>
That bloud-red billowes like a walled front<br>
On either side disparted with his rod,<br>
Till that his army dry-foot through them yod,<br>
Dwelt fortie dayes vpon; where writ in stone<br>
With bloudy letters by the hand of God,<br>
The bitter doome of death and balefull mone<br>
He did receiue, whiles flashing fire about him shone.<p>
 
Or like that sacred hill, whose head full hie,<br>
Adornd with fruitfull Oliues all arownd,<br>
Is, as it were for endlesse memory<br>
Of that deare Lord, who oft thereon was fownd,<br>
For euer with a flowring girlond crownd:<br>
Or like that pleasaunt Mount, that is for ay<br>
Through famous Poets verse each where renownd,<br>
On which the thrise three learned Ladies play<br>
Their heauenly notes, and make full many a louely lay.<p>
 
From thence, far off he vnto him did shew<br>
A litle path, that was both steepe and long,<br>
Which to a goodly Citie led his vew;<br>
Whose wals and towres were builded high and strong<br>
Of perle and precious stone, that earthly tong<br>
Cannot describe, nor wit of man can tell;<br>
Too high a ditty for my simple song;<br>
The Citie of the great king hight it well,<br>
Wherein eternall peace and happinesse doth dwell.<p>
 
As he thereon stood gazing, he might see<br>
The blessed Angels to and fro descend<br>
From highest heauen, in gladsome companee,<br>
And with great ioy into that Citie wend,<br>
As commonly as friend does with his frend.<br>
Whereat he wondred much, and gan enquere,<br>
What stately building durst so high extend<br>
Her loftie towres vnto the starry sphere,<br>
And what vnknowen nation there empeopled were.<p>
 
Faire knight (quoth he) <i>Hierusalem</i> that is,<br>
The new <i>Hierusalem</i>, that God has built<br>
For those to dwell in, that are chosen his,<br>
His chosen people purg'd from sinfull guilt,<br>
With pretious bloud, which cruelly was spilt<br>
On cursed tree, of that vnspotted lam,<br>
That for the sinnes of all the world was kilt:<br>
Now are they Saints all in that Citie sam,<br>
More deare vnto their God, then yo&#361;glings to their dam.<p>
 
Till now, said then the knight, I weened well,<br>
That great <i>Cleopolis</i>, where I haue beene,<br>
In which that fairest <i>Faerie Queene</i> doth dwell,<br>
The fairest Citie was, that might be seene;<br>
And that bright towre all built of christall cleene,<br>
<i>Panthea</i>, seemd the brightest thing, that was:<br>
But now by proofe all otherwise I weene;<br>
For this great Citie that does far surpas,<br>
And this bright Angels towre quite dims that towre of glas.<p>
 
Most trew, then said the holy aged man;<br>
Yet is <i>Cleopolis</i> for earthly frame,<br>
The fairest peece, that eye beholden can:<br>
And well beseemes all knights of noble name,<br>
That couet in th'immortall booke of fame<br>
To be eternized, that same to haunt,<br>
And doen their seruice to that soueraigne Dame,<br>
That glorie does to them for guerdon graunt:<br>
For she is heauenly borne, and heauen may iustly vaunt.<p>
 
And thou faire ymp, sprong out from English race,<br>
How euer now accompted Elfins sonne,<br>
Well worthy doest thy seruice for her grace,<br>
To aide a virgin desolate foredonne.<br>
But when thou famous victorie hast wonne,<br>
And high emongst all knights hast hong thy shield,<br>
Thenceforth the suit of earthly conquest shonne,<br>
And wash thy hands from guilt of bloudy field:<br>
For bloud can nought but sin, &amp; wars but sorrowes yield.<p>
 
Then seeke this path, that I to thee presage,<br>
Which after all to heauen shall thee send;<br>
Then peaceably thy painefull pilgrimage<br>
To yonder same <i>Hierusalem</i> do bend,<br>
Where is for thee ordaind a blessed end:<br>
For thou emongst those Saints, whom thou doest see,<br>
Shalt be a Saint, and thine owne nations frend<br>
And Patrone: thou Saint <i>George</i> shalt called bee,<br>
Saint <i>George</i> of mery England, the signe of victoree.<p>
 
Vnworthy wretch (quoth he) of so great grace,<br>
How dare I thinke such glory to attaine?<br>
These that haue it attaind, were in like cace<br>
(Quoth he) as wretched, and liu'd in like paine.<br>
But deeds of armes must I at last be faine,<br>
And Ladies loue to leaue so dearely bought?<br>
What need of armes, where peace doth ay remaine,<br>
(Said he) and battailes none are to be fought?<br>
As for loose loues they are vaine, and vanish into nought.<p>
 
O let me not (quoth he) then turne againe<br>
Backe to the world, whose ioyes so fruitlesse are;<br>
But let me here for aye in peace remaine,<br>
Or streight way on that last long voyage fare,<br>
That nothing may my present hope empare.<br>
That may not be (said he) ne maist thou yit<br>
Forgo that royall maides bequeathed care,<br>
Who did her cause into thy hand commit,<br>
Till from her cursed foe thou haue her freely quit.<p>
 
Then shall I soone, (quoth he) so God me grace,<br>
Abet that virgins cause disconsolate,<br>
And shortly backe returne vnto this place,<br>
To walke this way in Pilgrims poore estate.<br>
But now aread, old father, why of late<br>
Didst thou behight me borne of English blood,<br>
Whom all a Faeries sonne doen nominate?<br>
That word shall I (said he) auouchen good,<br>
Sith to thee is vnknowne the cradle of thy brood.<p>
 
For well I wote, thou springst from ancient race<br>
Of <i>Saxon</i> kings, that haue with mightie hand<br>
And many bloudie battailes fought in place<br>
High reard their royall throne in <i>Britane</i> land,<br>
And vanquisht them, vnable to withstand:<br>
From thence a Faerie thee vnweeting reft,<br>
There as thou slepst in tender swadling band,<br>
And her base Elfin brood there for thee left.<br>
Such men do Chaungelings call, so chaungd by Faeries theft.<p>
 
Thence she thee brought into this Faerie lond,<br>
And in an heaped furrow did thee hyde,<br>
Where thee a Ploughman all vnweeting fond,<br>
As he his toylesome teme that way did guyde,<br>
And brought thee vp in ploughmans state to byde,<br>
Whereof <i>Georgos</i> he thee gaue to name;<br>
Till prickt with courage, and thy forces pryde,<br>
To Faery court thou cam'st to seeke for fame,<br>
And proue thy puissaunt armes, as seemes thee best became.<p>
 
O holy Sire (quoth he) how shall I quight<br>
The many fauours I with thee haue found,<br>
That hast my name and nation red aright,<br>
And taught the way that does to heauen bound?<br>
This said, adowne he looked to the ground,<br>
To haue returnd, but dazed were his eyne,<br>
Through passing brightnesse, which did quite c&otilde;found<br>
His feeble sence, and too exceeding shyne.<br>
So darke are earthly things compard to things diuine.<p>
 
At last whenas himselfe he gan to find,<br>
To <i>Vna</i> back he cast him to retire;<br>
Who him awaited still with pensiue mind.<br>
Great thankes and goodly meed to that good syre,<br>
He thence departing gaue for his paines hyre.<br>
So came to <i>Vna</i>, who him ioyd to see,<br>
And after litle rest, gan him desire,<br>
Of her aduenture mindfull for to bee.<br>
So leaue they take of <i>Coelia</i>, and her daughters three.<p>
