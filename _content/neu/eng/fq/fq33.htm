<blockquote>
<i>The witches sonne loues Florimell:<br>
she flyes, he faines to die.<br>
Satyrane saues the Squire of Dames<br>
from Gyants tyrannie.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
L
Ike as an Hynd forth singled from the heard,<br>
That hath escaped from a rauenous beast,<br>
Yet flyes away of her owne feet affeard,<br>
And euery leafe, that shaketh with the least<br>
Murmure of winde, her terror hath encreast;<br>
So fled faire <i>Florimell</i> from her vaine feare,<br>
Long after she from perill was releast:<br>
Each shade she saw, and each noyse she did heare,<br>
Did seeme to be the same, which she escapt whyleare.<p>

All that same euening she in flying spent,<br>
And all that night her course continewed:<br>
Ne did she let dull sleepe once to relent,<br>
Nor wearinesse to slacke her hast, but fled<br>
Euer alike, as if her former dred<br>
Were hard behind, her readie to arrest:<br>
And her white Palfrey hauing conquered<br>
The maistring raines out of her weary wrest,<br>
Perforce her carried, where euer he thought best.<p>

So long as breath, and hable puissance<br>
Did natiue courage vnto him supply,<br>
His pace he freshly forward did aduaunce,<br>
And carried her beyond all ieopardy,<br>
But nought that wanteth rest, can long aby.<br>
He hauing through incessant trauell spent<br>
His force, at last perforce a downe did ly,<br>
Ne foot could further moue: the Lady gent<br>
Thereat was suddein strooke with great astonishment.<p>

And forst t'alight, on foot mote algates fare,<br>
A traueller vnwonted to such way:<br>
Need teacheth her this lesson hard and rare,<br>
That fortune all in equall launce doth sway,<br>
And mortall miseries doth make her play.<br>
So long she trauelled, till at length she came<br>
To an hilles side, which did to her bewray<br>
A little valley, subiect to the same,<br>
All couerd with thick woods, that quite it ouercame.<p>

Through the tops of the high trees she did descry<br>
A litle smoke, whose vapour thin and light,<br>
Reeking aloft, vprolled to the sky:<br>
Which, chearefull signe did send vnto her sight,<br>
That in the same did wonne some liuing wight.<br>
Eftsoones her steps she thereunto applyde,<br>
And came at last in weary wretched plight<br>
Vnto the place, to which her hope did guyde,<br>
To find some refuge there, and rest her weary syde.<p>

There in a gloomy hollow glen she found<br>
A little cottage, built of stickes and reedes<br>
In homely wize, and wald with sods around,<br>
In which a witch did dwell, in loathly weedes,<br>
And wilfull want, all carelesse of her needes;<br>
So choosing solitarie to abide,<br>
Far from all neighbours, that her deuilish deedes<br>
And hellish arts from people she might hide,<br>
And hurt far off vnknowne, whom euer she enuide.<p>

The Damzell there arriuing entred in;<br>
Where sitting on the flore the Hag she found,<br>
Busie (as seem'd) about some wicked gin:<br>
Who soone as she beheld that suddein stound,<br>
Lightly vpstarted from the dustie ground,<br>
And with fell looke and hollow deadly gaze<br>
Stared on her awhile, as one astound,<br>
Ne had one word to speake, for great amaze,<br>
But shewd by outward signes, that dread her sence did daze.<p>

At last turning her feare to foolish wrath,<br>
She askt, what deuill had her thither brought,<br>
And who she was, and what vnwonted path<br>
Had guided her, vnwelcomed, vnsought?<br>
To which the Damzell full of doubtfull thought,<br>
Her mildly answer'd; Beldame be not wroth<br>
With silly Virgin by aduenture brought<br>
Vnto your dwelling, ignorant and loth,<br>
That craue but rowme to rest, while tempest ouerblo'th.<p>

With that adowne out of her Christall eyne<br>
Few trickling teares she softly forth let fall,<br>
That like two Orient pearles, did purely shyne<br>
Vpon her snowy cheeke; and therewithall<br>
She sighed soft, that none so bestiall,<br>
Nor saluage hart, but ruth of her sad plight<br>
Would make to melt, or pitteously appall;<br>
And that vile Hag, all were her whole delight<br>
In mischiefe, was much moued at so pitteous sight.<p>

And gan recomfort her in her rude wyse,<br>
With womanish compassion of her plaint,<br>
Wiping the teares from her suffused eyes,<br>
And bidding her sit downe, to rest her faint<br>
And wearie limbs a while.  She nothing quaint<br>
Nor s'deignfull of so homely fashion,<br>
Sith brought she was now to so hard constraint,<br>
Sate downe vpon the dusty ground anon,<br>
As glad of that small rest, as Bird of tempest gon.<p>

Tho gan she gather vp her garments rent,<br>
And her loose lockes to dight in order dew,<br>
With golden wreath and gorgeous ornament;<br>
Whom such whenas the wicked Hag did vew,<br>
She was astonisht at her heauenly hew,<br>
And doubted her to deeme an earthly wight,<br>
But or some Goddesse, or of <i>Dianes</i> crew,<br>
And thought her to adore with humble spright;<br>
T'adore thing so diuine as beauty, were but right.<p>

This wicked woman had a wicked sonne,<br>
The comfort of her age and weary dayes,<br>
A laesie loord, for nothing good to donne,<br>
But stretched forth in idlenesse alwayes,<br>
Ne euer cast his mind to couet prayse,<br>
Or ply him selfe to any honest trade,<br>
But all the day before the sunny rayes<br>
He vs'd to slug, or sleepe in slothfull shade:<br>
Such laesinesse both lewd and poore attonce him made.<p>

He comming home at vndertime, there found<br>
The fairest creature, that he euer saw,<br>
Sitting beside his mother on the ground;<br>
The sight whereof did greatly him adaw,<br>
And his base thought with terrour and with aw<br>
So inly smot, that as one, which had gazed<br>
On the bright Sunne vnwares, doth soone withdraw<br>
His feeble eyne, with too much brightnesse dazed,<br>
So stared he on her, and stood long while amazed.<p>

Softly at last he gan his mother aske,<br>
What mister wight that was, and whence deriued,<br>
That in so straunge disguizement there did maske,<br>
And by what accident she there arriued:<br>
But she, as one nigh of her wits depriued,<br>
With nought but ghastly lookes him answered,<br>
Like to a ghost, that lately is reuiued<br>
From <i>Stygian</i> shores, where late it wandered;<br>
So both at her, and each at other wondered.<p>

But the faire Virgin was so meeke and mild,<br>
That she to them vouchsafed to embace<br>
Her goodly port, and to their senses vild,<br>
Her gentle speach applide, that in short space<br>
She grew familiare in that desert place.<br>
During which time, the Chorle through her so kind<br>
And curteise vse conceiu'd affection bace,<br>
And cast to loue her in his brutish mind;<br>
No loue, but brutish lust, that was so beastly tind.<p>

Closely the wicked flame his bowels brent,<br>
And shortly grew into outrageous fire;<br>
Yet had he not the hart, nor hardiment,<br>
As vnto her to vtter his desire;<br>
His caytiue thought durst not so high aspire,<br>
But with soft sighes, and louely semblaunces,<br>
He ween'd that his affection entire<br>
She should aread; many resemblaunces<br>
 To her he made, and many kind remembraunces.<p>

Oft from the forrest wildings he did bring,<br>
Whose sides empurpled were with smiling red,<br>
And oft young birds, which he had taught to sing<br>
His mistresse prayses, sweetly caroled,<br>
Girlonds of flowres sometimes for her faire hed<br>
He fine would dight; sometimes the squirell wild<br>
He brought to her in bands, as conquered<br>
To be her thrall, his fellow seruant vild;<br>
All which, she of him tooke with countenance meeke and mild.<p>

But past awhile, when she fit season saw<br>
To leaue that desert mansion, she cast<br>
In secret wize her selfe thence to withdraw,<br>
For feare of mischiefe, which she did forecast<br>
Might by the witch or by her sonne compast:<br>
Her wearie Palfrey closely, as she might,<br>
Now well recouered after long repast,<br>
In his proud furnitures she freshly dight,<br>
His late miswandred wayes now to remeasure right.<p>

And earely ere the dawning day appeard,<br>
She forth issewed, and on her iourney went;<br>
She went in perill, of each noyse affeard,<br>
And of each shade, that did it selfe present;<br>
For still she feared to be ouerhent,<br>
Of that vile hag, or her vnciuile sonne:<br>
Who when too late awaking, well they kent,<br>
That their faire guest was gone, they both begonne<br>
To make exceeding mone, as they had bene vndonne.<p>

But that lewd louer did the most lament<br>
For her depart, that euer man did heare;<br>
He knockt his brest with desperate intent,<br>
And scratcht his face, and with his teeth did teare<br>
His rugged flesh, and rent his ragged heare:<br>
That his sad mother seeing his sore plight,<br>
Was greatly woe begon, and gan to feare,<br>
Least his fraile senses were emperisht quight,<br>
And loue to frenzy turnd, sith loue is franticke hight.<p>

All wayes she sought, him to restore to plight,<br>
With herbs, with charms, with co&#361;sell, &amp; with teares,<br>
But tears, nor charms, nor herbs, nor counsell might<br>
Asswage the fury, which his entrails teares:<br>
So strong is passion, that no reason heares.<br>
Tho when all other helpes she saw to faile,<br>
She turnd her selfe backe to her wicked leares<br>
And by her deuilish arts thought to preuaile,<br>
To bring her backe againe, or worke her finall bale.<p>

Eftsoones out of her hidden caue she cald<br>
An hideous beast, of horrible aspect,<br>
That could the stoutest courage haue appald;<br>
Monstrous mishapt, and all his backe was spect<br>
With thousand spots of colours queint elect,<br>
Thereto so swift, that it all beasts did pas:<br>
Like neuer yet did liuing eye detect;<br>
But likest it to an <i>Hyena</i> was,<br>
That feeds on womens flesh, as others feede on gras.<p>

It forth she cald, and gaue it streight in charge,<br>
Through thicke and thin her to pursew apace,<br>
Ne once to stay to rest, or breath at large,<br>
Till her he had attaind, and brought in place,<br>
Or quite deuourd her beauties scornefull grace.<br>
The Monster swift as word, that from her went,<br>
Went forth in hast, and did her footing trace<br>
So sure and swiftly, through his perfect scent,<br>
And passing speede, that shortly he her ouerhent.<p>

Whom when the fearefull Damzell nigh espide,<br>
No need to bid her fast away to flie;<br>
That vgly shape so sore her terrifide,<br>
That it she shund no lesse, then dread to die,<br>
And her flit Palfrey did so well apply<br>
His nimble feet to her conceiued feare,<br>
That whilest his breath did strength to him supply,<br>
From perill free he her away did beare:<br>
But when his force gan faile, his pace gan wex areare.<p>

Which whenas she perceiu'd, she was dismayd<br>
At that same last extremitie full sore,<br>
And of her safetie greatly grew afrayd;<br>
And now she gan approch to the sea shore,<br>
As it befell, that she could flie no more,<br>
But yield her selfe to spoile of greedinesse.<br>
Lightly she leaped, as a wight forlore,<br>
From her dull horse, in desperate distresse,<br>
And to her feet betooke her doubtfull sickernesse.<p>

Not halfe so fast the wicked <i>Myrrha</i> fled<br>
From dread of her reuenging fathers hond:<br>
Nor halfe so fast to saue her maidenhed,<br>
Fled fearefull <i>Daphne</i> on th'<i>&AElig;g&aelig;an</i> strond,<br>
As <i>Florimell</i> fled from that Monster yond,<br>
To reach the sea, ere she of him were raught:<br>
For in the sea to drowne her selfe she fond,<br>
Rather then of the tyrant to be caught:<br>
Thereto feare gaue her wings, and neede her courage taught.<p>

It fortuned (high God did so ordaine)<br>
As she arriued on the roring shore,<br>
In minde to leape into the mighty maine,<br>
A little boate lay houing her before,<br>
In which there slept a fisher old and pore,<br>
The whiles his nets were drying on the sand:<br>
Into the same she leapt, and with the ore<br>
Did thrust the shallop from the floting strand:<br>
So safetie found at sea, which she found not at land.<p>

The Monster ready on the pray to sease,<br>
Was of his forward hope deceiued quight;<br>
Ne durst assay to wade the perlous seas,<br>
But greedily long gaping at the sight,<br>
At last in vaine was forst to turne his flight,<br>
And tell the idle tidings to his Dame:<br>
Yet to auenge his deuilish despight,<br>
He set vpon her Palfrey tired lame,<br>
And slew him cruelly, ere any reskew came.<p>

And after hauing him embowelled,<br>
To fill his hellish gorge, it chaunst a knight<br>
To passe that way, as forth he trauelled;<br>
It was a goodly Swaine, and of great might,<br>
As euer man that bloudy field did fight;<br>
But in vaine sheows, that wont yongknights bewitch,<br>
And courtly seruices tooke no delight,<br>
But rather ioyd to be, then seemen sich:<br>
For both to be and seeme to him was labour lich.<p>

It was to weete the good Sir <i>Satyrane</i>,<br>
That raungd abroad to seeke aduentures wilde,<br>
As was his wont in forrest, and in plaine;<br>
He was all armd in rugged steele vnfilde,<br>
As in the smoky forge it was compilde,<br>
And in his Scutchin bore a Satyres hed:<br>
He comming present, where the Monster vilde<br>
Vpon that milke-white Palfreyes carkas fed,<br>
Vnto his reskew ran, and greedily him sped.<p>

There well perceiu'd he, that it was the horse,<br>
Whereon faire <i>Florimell</i> was wont to ride,<br>
That of that feend was rent without remorse:<br>
Much feared he, least ought did ill betide<br>
To that faire Mayd, the flowre of womens pride;<br>
For her he dearely loued, and in all<br>
His famous conquests highly magnifide:<br>
Besides her golden girdle, which did fall<br>
From her in flight, he found, that did him sore apall.<p>

Full of sad feare, and doubtfull agony,<br>
Fiercely he flew vpon that wicked feend,<br>
And with huge strokes, and cruell battery<br>
Him forst to leaue his pray, for to attend<br>
Him selfe from deadly daunger to defend:<br>
Full many wounds in his corrupted flesh<br>
He did engraue, and muchell bloud did spend,<br>
Yet might not do him dye, but aye more fresh<br>
And fierce he still appeard, the more he did him thresh.<p>

He wist not, how him to despoile of life,<br>
Ne how to win the wished victory,<br>
Sith him he saw still stronger grow through strife,<br>
And him selfe weaker through infirmity;<br>
Greatly he grew enrag'd, and furiously<br>
Hurling his sword away, he lightly lept<br>
Vpon the beast, that with great cruelty<br>
Rored, and raged to be vnder-kept:<br>
Yet he perforce him held, and strokes vpon him hept.<p>

As he that striues to stop a suddein flood,<br>
And in strong banckes his violence enclose,<br>
Forceth it swell aboue his wonted mood,<br>
And largely ouerflow the fruitfull plaine,<br>
That all the countrey seemes to be a Maine,<br>
And the rich furrowes flote, all quite fordonne:<br>
The wofull husbandman doth lowd complaine,<br>
To see his whole yeares labour lost so soone,<br>
For which to God he made so many an idle boone.<p>

So him he held, and did through might amate:<br>
So long he held him, and him bet so long,<br>
That at the last his fiercenesse gan abate,<br>
And meekely stoup vnto the victour strong:<br>
Who to auenge the implacable wrong,<br>
Which he supposed donne to <i>Florimell</i>,<br>
Sought by all meanes his dolour to prolong,<br>
Sith dint of steele his carcas could not quell:<br>
His maker with her charmes had framed him so well.<p>

The golden ribband, which that virgin wore<br>
About her sclender wast, he tooke in hand,<br>
And with it bound the beast, that lowd did rore<br>
For great despight of that vnwonted band,<br>
Yet dared not his victour to withstand,<br>
But trembled like a lambe, fled from the pray,<br>
And all the way him followd on the strand,<br>
As he had long bene learned to obay;<br>
Yet neuer learned he such seruice, till that day.<p>

Thus as he led the Beast along the way,<br>
He spide far off a mighty Giauntesse,<br>
Fast flying on a Courser dapled gray,<br>
From a bold knight, that with great hardinesse<br>
Her hard pursewd, and sought for to suppresse;<br>
She bore before her lap a dolefull Squire,<br>
Lying athwart her horse in great distresse,<br>
Fast bounden hand and foote with cords of wire,<br>
Whom she did meane to make the thrall of her desire.<p>

Which whenas <i>Satyrane</i> beheld, in hast<br>
He left his captiue Beast at liberty,<br>
And crost the nearest way, by which he cast<br>
Her to encounter, ere she passed by:<br>
But she the way shund nathemore for thy,<br>
But forward gallopt fast; which when he spyde,<br>
His mighty speare he couched warily,<br>
And at her ran: she hauing him descryde,<br>
Her selfe to fight addrest, and threw her lode aside.<p>

Like as a Goshauke, that in foote doth beare<br>
A trembling Culuer, hauing spide on hight<br>
An Egle, that with plumy wings doth sheare<br>
The subtile ayre, stouping with all his might,<br>
The quarrey throwes to ground with fell despight,<br>
And to the battell doth her selfe prepare:<br>
So ran the Geauntesse vnto the fight;<br>
Her firie eyes with furious sparkes did stare,<br>
And with blasphemous bannes high God in peeces tare.<p>

She caught in hand an huge great yron mace,<br>
Wherewith she many had of life depriued,<br>
But ere the stroke could seize his aymed place,<br>
His speare amids her sun-broad shield arriued;<br>
Yet nathemore the steele a sunder riued,<br>
All were the beame in bignesse like a mast,<br>
Ne her out of the stedfast sadle driued,<br>
But glauncing on the tempred mettall, brast<br>
In thousand shiuers, and so forth beside her past.<p>

Her Steed did stagger with that puissaunt strooke;<br>
But she no more was moued with that might,<br>
Then it had lighted on an aged Oke;<br>
Or on the marble Pillour, that is pight<br>
Vpon the top of Mount <i>Olympus</i> hight,<br>
For the braue youthly Champions to assay,<br>
With burning charet wheeles it nigh to smite:<br>
But who that smites it, mars his ioyous play,<br>
And is the spectacle of ruinous decay.<p>

Yet therewith sore enrag'd, with sterne regard<br>
Her dreadfull weapon she to him addrest,<br>
Which on his helmet martelled so hard,<br>
That made him low incline his lofty crest,<br>
And bowd his battred visour to his brest:<br>
Wherewith he was so stund, that he n'ote ryde,<br>
But reeled to and fro from East to West:<br>
Which when his cruell enimy espyde,<br>
She lightly vnto him adioyned side to syde;<p>

And on his collar laying puissant hand,<br>
Out of his wauering seat him pluckt perforse,<br>
Perforse him pluckt, vnable to withstand,<br>
Or helpe himselfe, and laying thwart her horse,<br>
In loathly wise like to a carion corse,<br>
She bore him fast away.  Which when the knight,<br>
That her pursewed, saw with great remorse,<br>
He neare was touched in his noble spright,<br>
And gan encrease his speed, as she encreast her flight.<p>

Whom when as nigh approching she espyde,<br>
She threw away her burden angrily;<br>
For she list not the battell to abide,<br>
But made her selfe more light, away to fly:<br>
Yet her the hardy knight pursewd so nye,<br>
That almost in the backe he oft her strake:<br>
But still when him at hand she did espy,<br>
She turnd, and semblaunce of faire fight did make;<br>
But when he stayd, to flight againe she did her take.<p>

By this the good Sir <i>Satyrane</i> gan wake<br>
Out of his dreame, that did him long entraunce,<br>
And seeing none in place, he gan to make<br>
Exceeding mone, and curst that cruell chaunce,<br>
Which reft from him so faire a cheuisaunce:<br>
At length he spide, whereas that wofull Squire,<br>
Whom he had reskewed from captiuaunce<br>
Of his strong foe, lay tombled in the myre,<br>
Vnable to arise, or foot or hand to styre.<p>

To whom approching, well he mote perceiue<br>
In that foule plight a comely personage,<br>
And louely face, made fit for to deceiue<br>
Fraile Ladies hart with loues consuming rage,<br>
Now in the blossome of his freshest age:<br>
He reard him vp, and loosd his yron bands,<br>
And after gan inquire his parentage,<br>
And how he fell into that Gyaunts hands,<br>
And who that was, which chaced her along the lands.<p>

Then trembling yet through feare, the Squire bespake,<br>
That Geauntesse <i>Argante</i> is behight,<br>
A daughter of the <i>Titans</i> which did make<br>
Warre against heauen, and heaped hils on hight,<br>
To scale the skyes, and put <i>Ioue</i> from his right:<br>
Her sire <i>Typhoeus</i> was, who mad through merth,<br>
And drunke with bloud of men, slaine by his might,<br>
Through incest, her of his owne mother Earth<br>
Whilome begot, being but halfe twin of that berth.<p>

For at that berth another Babe she bore,<br>
To weet the mighty <i>Ollyphant</i>, that wrought<br>
Great wreake to many errant knights of yore,<br>
And many hath to foule confusion brought.<br>
These twinnes, men say, (a thing far passing thought)<br>
Whiles in their mothers wombe enclosd they were,<br>
Ere they into the lightsome world were brought,<br>
In fleshly lust were mingled both yfere,<br>
And in that monstrous wise did to the world appere.<p>

So liu'd they euer after in like sin,<br>
Gainst natures law, and good behauioure:<br>
But greatest shame was to that maiden twin,<br>
Who not content so fowly to deuoure<br>
Her natiue flesh, and staine her brothers bowre,<br>
Did wallow in all other fleshly myre,<br>
And suffred beasts her body to deflowre:<br>
So whot she burned in that lustfull fyre,<br>
Yet all that might not slake her sensuall desyre.<p>

But ouer all the countrey she did raunge,<br>
To seeke young men, to quench her flaming thurst,<br>
And feed her fancy with delightfull chaunge:<br>
Whom so she fittest finds to serue her lust,<br>
Through her maine strength, in which she most doth trust,<br>
She with her brings into a secret Ile,<br>
Where in eternall bondage dye he must,<br>
Or be the vassall of her pleasures vile,<br>
And in all shamefull sort him selfe with her defile.<p>

Me seely wretch she so at vauntage caught,<br>
After she long in waite for me did lye,<br>
And meant vnto her prison to haue brought,<br>
Her lothsome pleasure there to satisfye;<br>
That thousand deathes me leuer were to dye,<br>
Then breake the vow, that to faire <i>Columbell</i><br>
I plighted haue, and yet keepe stedfastly:<br>
As for my name, it mistreth not to tell;<br>
Call me the <i>Squyre of Dames</i> that me beseemeth well.<p>

But that bold knight, whom ye pursuing saw<br>
That Geauntesse, is not such, as she seemed,<br>
But a faire virgin, that in martiall law,<br>
And deedes of armes aboue all Dames is deemed,<br>
And aboue many knights is eke esteemed,<br>
For her great worth; she <i>Palladine</i> is hight:<br>
She you from death, you me from dread redeemed.<br>
Ne any may that Monster match in fight,<br>
But she, or such as she, that is so chaste a wight.<p>

Her well beseemes that Quest (quoth <i>Satyrane</i>)<br>
But read, thou <i>Squyre of Dames</i>, what vow is this,<br>
Which thou vpon thy selfe hast lately ta'ne?<br>
That shall I you recount (quoth he) ywis,<br>
So be ye pleasd to pardon all amis.<br>
That gentle Lady, whom I loue and serue,<br>
After long suit and weary seruicis,<br>
Did aske me, how I could her loue deserue,<br>
And how she might be sure, that I would neuer swerue.<p>

I glad by any meanes her grace to gaine,<br>
Bad her commaund my life to saue, or spill.<br>
Eftsoones she bad me, with incessaunt paine<br>
To wander through the world abroad at will,<br>
And euery where, where with my power or skill<br>
I might do seruice vnto gentle Dames,<br>
That I the same should faithfully fulfill,<br>
And at the twelue monethes end should bring their names<br>
And pledges; as the spoiles of my victorious games.<p>

So well I to faire Ladies seruice did,<br>
And found such fauour in their louing hartes,<br>
That ere the yeare his course had compassid,<br>
Three hundred pledges for my good desartes,<br>
And thrise three hundred thanks for my good partes<br>
I with me brought, and did to her present:<br>
Which when she saw, more bent to eke my smartes,<br>
Then to reward my trusty true intent,<br>
She gan for me deuise a grieuous punishment.<p>

To weet, that I my trauell should resume,<br>
And with like labour walke the world around,<br>
Ne euer to her presence should presume,<br>
Till I so many other Dames had found,<br>
The which, for all the suit I could propound,<br>
Would me refuse their pledges to afford,<br>
But did abide for euer chast and sound.<br>
Ah gentle Squire (quoth he) tell at one word,<br>
How many foundst thou such to put in thy record?<p>

In deed Sir knight (said he) one word may tell<br>
All, that I euer found so wisely stayd;<br>
For onely three they were disposd so well,<br>
And yet three yeares I now abroad haue strayd,<br>
To find them out.  Mote I (then laughing sayd<br>
The knight) inquire of thee, what were those three,<br>
The which thy proffred curtesie denayd?<br>
Or ill they seemed sure auizd to bee,<br>
Or brutishly brought vp, that neu'r did fashions see.<p>

The first which then refused me (said hee)<br>
Certes was but a common Courtisane,<br>
Yet flat refusd to haue a do with mee,<br>
Because I could not giue her many a Iane.<br>
(Thereat full hartely laughed <i>Satyrane</i>.)<br>
The second was an holy Nunne to chose,<br>
Which would not let me be her Chappellane,<br>
Because she knew, she said, I would disclose<br>
Her counsell, if he should her trust in me repose.<p>

The third a Damzell was of low degree,<br>
Whom I in countrey cottage found by chaunce;<br>
Full little weened I, that chastitee<br>
Had lodging in so meane a maintenaunce,<br>
Yet was she faire, and in her countenance<br>
Dwelt simple truth in seemely fashion.<br>
Long thus I woo'd her with dew obseruance,<br>
In hope vnto my pleasure to haue won;<br>
But was as farre at last, as when I first begon.<p>

Safe her, I neuer any woman found,<br>
That chastity did for it selfe embrace,<br>
But were for other causes firme and sound;<br>
Either for want of handsome time and place,<br>
Or else for feare of shame and fowle disgrace.<br>
Thus am I hopelesse euer to attaine<br>
My Ladies loue, in such a desperate case,<br>
But all my dayes am like to wast in vaine,<br>
Seeking to match the chaste with th'vnchaste Ladies traine.<p>

Perdy, (said <i>Satyrane</i>) thou <i>Squire of Dames</i>,<br>
Great labour fondly hast thou hent in hand,<br>
To get small thankes, and therewith many blames,<br>
That may emongst <i>Alcides</i> labours stand.<br>
Thence backe returning to the former land,<br>
Where late he left the Beast, he ouercame,<br>
He found him not; for he had broke his band,<br>
And was return'd againe vnto his Dame,<br>
To tell what tydings of faire <i>Florimell</i> became.<p>
