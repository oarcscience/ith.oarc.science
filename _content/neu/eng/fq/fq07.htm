<p> 
<blockquote> 
 
 
<i>The faithfull knight in equall field<br> 
subdewes his faithlesse foe,<br> 
Whom false Duessa saues, and for<br>  
his cure to hell does goe. </i><p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>
<blockquote>     
THe noble hart, that harbours vertuous 
thought,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And is with child of glorious great intent,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can neuer rest, vntill it forth haue brought<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Th'eternall brood of glorie excellent:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such restlesse passion did all night torment<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The flaming corage of that Faery knight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Deuizing, how that doughtie turnament<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With greatest honour he atchieuen might;<br>
Still did he wake, and still did watch for dawning light.<p>
 
At last the golden Orientall gate<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of greatest heauen gan to open faire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And <i>Phoebus</i> fresh, as bridegrome to his mate,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Came dauncing forth, shaking his deawie haire:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And hurld his glistring beames through gloomy aire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which when the wakeful Elfe perceiu'd, streight way<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He started vp, and did him selfe prepaire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In sun-bright armes, and battailous array:<br>
For with that Pagan proud he combat will that day.<p>
 
And forth he comes into the commune hall,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where earely waite him many a gazing eye,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To weet what end to straunger knights may fall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
There many Minstrales maken melody,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To driue away the dull melancholy,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And many Bardes, that to the trembling chord<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Can tune their timely voyces cunningly,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And many Chroniclers, that can record<br>
Old loues, and warres for Ladies doen by many a Lord.<p>
 
Soone after comes the cruell Sarazin,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In wouen maile all armed warily,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sternly lookes at him, who not a pin<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does care for looke of liuing creatures eye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
They bring them wines of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Araby</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And daintie spices fetcht from furthest <i>Ynd</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To kindle heat of corage priuily:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in the wine a solemne oth they bynd<br>
T'obserue the sacred lawes of armes, that are assynd.<p>
 
At last forth comes that far renowmed Queene,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With royall pomp and Princely maiestie;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She is ybrought vnto a paled greene,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And placed vnder stately canapee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The warlike feates of both those knights to see.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
On th'other side in all mens open vew<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Duessa</i> placed is, and on a tree<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Sans-foy</i> his shield is hangd with bloudy hew:<br>
Both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew.<p>
 
A shrilling trompet sownded from on hye,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And vnto battaill bad them selues addresse:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Their shining shieldes about their wrestes they tye,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And burning blades about their heads do blesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The instruments of wrath and heauinesse:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With greedy force each other doth assayle,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And strike so fiercely, that they do impresse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Deepe dinted furrowes in the battred mayle;<br>
The yron walles to ward their blowes are weake &amp; fraile.<p>
 
The Sarazin was stout, and wondrous strong,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And heaped blowes like yron hammers great:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For after bloud and vengeance he did long.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The knight was fiers, and full of youthly heat:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And doubled strokes, like dreaded thunders threat:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For all for prayse and honour he did fight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both stricken strike, and beaten both do beat,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That from their shields forth flyeth firie light,<br>
And helmets hewen deepe, shew marks of eithers might.<p>
 
So th'one for wrong, the other striues for right:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As when a Gryfon seized of his pray,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A Dragon fiers encountreth in his flight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through widest ayre making his ydle way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That would his rightfull rauine rend away:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With hideous horrour both together smight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And souce so sore, that they the heauens affray:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The wise Southsayer seeing so sad sight,<br>
Th'amazed vulgar tels of warres and mortall fight.<p>
 
So th'one for wrong, the other striues for right,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And each to deadly shame would driue his foe:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The cruell steele so greedily doth bight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In tender flesh, that streames of bloud down flow,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With which the armes, that earst so bright did show,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Into a pure vermillion now are dyde:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Great ruth in all the gazers harts did grow,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Seeing the gored woundes to gape so wyde,<br>
That victory they dare not wish to either side.<p>
 
At last the Paynim chaunst to cast his eye,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His suddein eye, flaming with wrathfull fyre,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon his brothers shield, which hong thereby:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therewith redoubled was his raging yre,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And said, Ah wretched sonne of wofull syre,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doest thou sit wayling by black <i>Stygian</i> lake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whilest here thy shield is hangd for victors hyre,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sluggish german doest thy forces slake,<br>
To after-send his foe, that him may ouertake?<p>
 
Goe caytiue Elfe, him quickly ouertake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And soone redeeme from his long wandring woe;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goe guiltie ghost, to him my message make,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That I his shield haue quit from dying foe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therewith vpon his crest he stroke him so,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That twise he reeled, readie twise to fall;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
End of the doubtfull battell deemed tho<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The lookers on, and lowd to him gan call<br>
The false <i>Duessa</i>, Thine the shield, and I, and all.<p>
 
Soone as the Faerie heard his Ladie speake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Out of his swowning dreame he gan awake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And quickning faith, that earst was woxen weake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The creeping deadly cold away did shake:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tho mou'd with wrath, and shame, and Ladies sake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of all attonce he cast auengd to bee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And with so'exceeding furie at him strake,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That forced him to stoupe vpon his knee;<br>
Had he not stouped so, he should haue clouen bee.<p>
 
And to him said, Goe now proud Miscreant,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thy selfe thy message doe to german deare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alone he wandring thee too long doth want:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goe say, his foe thy shield with his doth beare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therewith his heauie hand he high gan reare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Him to haue slaine; when loe a darkesome clowd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vpon him fell: he no where doth appeare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But vanisht is. The Elfe him cals alowd,<br>
But answer none receiues: the darknes him does shrowd.<p>
 
In haste <i>Duessa</i> from her place arose,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And to him running said, O prowest knight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That euer Ladie to her loue did chose,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Let now abate the terror of your might,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And quench the flame of furious despight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And bloudie vengeance; lo th'infernall powres<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Couering your foe with cloud of deadly night,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Haue borne him hence to <i>Plutoes</i> balefull bowres.<br>
The conquest yours, I yours, the shield, and glory yours.<p>
 
Not all so satisfide, with greedie eye<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He sought all round about, his thirstie blade<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To bath in bloud of faithlesse enemy;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who all that while lay hid in secret shade:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He standes amazed, how he thence should fade.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
At last the trumpets Triumph sound on hie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And running Heralds humble homage made,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Greeting him goodly with new victorie,<br>
And to him brought the shield, the cause of enmitie.<p>
 
Wherewith he goeth to that soueraine Queene,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And falling her before on lowly knee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To her makes present of his seruice seene:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which she accepts, with thankes, and goodly gree,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Greatly aduauncing his gay cheualree.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
So marcheth home, and by her takes the knight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whom all the people follow with great glee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shouting, and clapping all their hands on hight,<br>
That all the aire it fils, and flyes to heauen bright.<p>
 
Home is he brought, and laid in sumptuous bed:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where many skilfull leaches him abide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To salue his hurts, that yet still freshly bled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And softly can embalme on euery side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all the while, most heauenly melody<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
About the bed sweet musicke did diuide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Him to beguile of griefe and agony:<br>
And all the while <i>Duessa</i> wept full bitterly.<p>
 
As when a wearie traueller that strayes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By muddy shore of broad seuen-mouthed <i>Nile</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnweeting of the perillous wandring wayes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doth meet a cruell craftie Crocodile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which in false griefe hyding his harmefull guile,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Doth weepe full sore, and sheddeth tender teares:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The foolish man, that pitties all this while<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His mournefull plight, is swallowd vp vnwares,<br>
Forgetfull of his owne, that mindes anothers cares.<p>
 
So wept <i>Duessa</i> vntill euentide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That shyning lampes in <i>Ioues</i> high house were light:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then forth she rose, ne lenger would abide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But comes vnto the place, where th'Hethen knight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In slombring swownd nigh voyd of vitall spright,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lay couer'd with inchaunted cloud all day:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whom when she found, as she him left in plight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To wayle his woefull case she would not stay,<br>
But to the easterne coast of heauen makes speedy way.<p>
 
Where griesly <i>Night</i>, with visage deadly sad,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That <i>Phoebus</i> chearefull face durst neuer vew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in a foule blacke pitchie mantle clad,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She findes forth comming from her darkesome mew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where she all day did hide her hated hew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before the dore her yron charet stood,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alreadie harnessed for iourney new;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood,<br>
That on their rustie bits did champ, as they were wood.<p>
 
Who when she saw <i>Duessa</i> sunny bright,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Adornd with gold and iewels shining cleare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
She greatly grew amazed at the sight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And th'vnacquainted light began to feare:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For neuer did such brightnesse there appeare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And would haue backe retyred to her caue,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vntill the witches speech she gan to heare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Saying, Yet &ocirc; thou dreaded Dame, I craue<br>
Abide, till I haue told the message, which I haue.<p>
 
She stayd, and foorth <i>Duessa</i> gan proceede,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
O thou most auncient Grandmother of all,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
More old then <i>Ioue</i>, whom thou at first didst 
breede,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or that great house of Gods c&aelig;lestiall,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which wast begot in <i>D&aelig;mogorgons</i> hall,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sawst the secrets of the world vnmade,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why suffredst thou thy Nephewes deare to fall<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With Elfin sword, most shamefully betrade?<br>
Lo where the stout <i>Sansioy</i> doth sleepe in deadly shade.<p>
 
And him before, I saw with bitter eyes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bold <i>Sansfoy</i> shrinke vnderneath his speare;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And now the pray of fowles in field he lyes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nor wayld of friends, nor laid on groning beare,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That whylome was to me too dearely deare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
O what of Gods then boots it to be borne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
If old <i>Aveugles</i> sonnes so euill heare?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or who shall not great <i>Nightes</i> children scorne,<br>
When two of three her Nephews are so fowle forlorne?<p>
 
Vp then, vp dreary Dame, of darknesse Queene,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Go gather vp the reliques of thy race,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or else goe them auenge, and let be seene,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That dreaded <i>Night</i> in brightest day hath place,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And can the children of faire light deface.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her feeling speeches some compassion moued<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In hart, and chaunge in that great mothers face:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yet pittie in her hart was neuer proued<br>
Till then: for euermore she hated, neuer loued.<p>
 
And said, Deare daughter rightly may I rew<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The fall of famous children borne of mee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And good successes, which their foes ensew:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But who can turne the streame of destinee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Or breake the chayne of strong necessitee,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which fast is tyde to <i>Ioues</i> eternall seat?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sonnes of Day he fauoureth, I see,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And by my ruines thinkes to make them great:<br>
To make one great by others losse, is bad excheat.<p>
 
Yet shall they not escape so freely all;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For some shall pay the price of others guilt:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And he the man that made <i>Sansfoy</i> to fall,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shall with his owne bloud price that he hath spilt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But what art thou, that telst of Nephews kilt?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I that do seeme not I, <i>Duessa</i> am,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Quoth she) how euer now in garments gilt,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And gorgeous gold arayd I to thee came;<br>
<i>Duessa</i> I, the daughter of Deceipt and Shame.<p>
 
Then bowing downe her aged backe, she kist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The wicked witch, saying; In that faire face<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The false resemblance of Deceipt, I wist<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did closely lurke; yet so true-seeming grace<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It carried, that I scarse in darkesome place<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Could it discerne, though I the mother bee<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of falshood, and root of <i>Duessaes</i> race.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
O welcome child, whom I haue longd to see,<br>
And how haue seene vnwares. Lo now I go with thee.<p>
 
Then to her yron wagon she betakes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And with her beares the fowle welfauourd witch:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through mirkesome aire her readie way she makes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her twyfold Teme, of which two blacke as pitch,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And two were browne, yet each to each vnlich,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did softly swim away, ne euer stampe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnlesse she chaunst their stubborne mouths to twitch;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Then foming tarre, their bridles they would champe,<br>
And trampling the fine element, would fiercely rampe.<p>
 
So well they sped, that they be come at length<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnto the place, whereas the Paynim lay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Deuoid of outward sense, and natiue strength,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Couerd with charmed cloud from vew of day,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sight of men, since his late luckelesse fray.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His cruell wounds with cruddy bloud congealed,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
They binden vp so wisely, as they may,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And handle softly, till they can be healed:<br>
So lay him in her charet, close in night concealed.<p>
 
And all the while she stood vpon the ground,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The wakefull dogs did neuer cease to bay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As giuing warning of th'vnwonted sound,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With which her yron wheeles did them affray,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And her darke griesly looke them much dismay;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The messenger of death, the ghastly Owle<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With drearie shriekes did also her bewray;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And hungry Wolues continually did howle,<br>
At her abhorred face, so filthy and so fowle.<p>
 
Thence turning backe in silence soft they stole,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And brought the heauie corse with easie pace<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To yawning gulfe of deepe <i>Auernus</i> hole.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By that same hole an entrance darke and bace<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With smoake and sulphure hiding all the place,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Descends to hell: there creature neuer past,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That backe returned without heauenly grace;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But dreadfull <i>Furies</i>, which their chaines haue brast,<br>
And damned sprights sent forth to make ill men aghast.<p>
 
By that same way the direfull dames doe driue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Their mournefull charet, fild with rusty blood,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And downe to <i>Plutoes</i> house are come biliue:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which passing through, on euery side them stood<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chattring their yron teeth, and staring wide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With stonie eyes; and all the hellish brood<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of feends infernall flockt on euery side,<br>
To gaze on earthly wight, that with the Night durst ride.<p>
 
They pas the bitter waues of <i>Acheron</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where many soules sit wailing woefully,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And come to fiery flood of <i>Phlegeton</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And with sharpe shrilling shriekes doe bootlesse cry,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cursing high <i>Ioue</i>, the which them thither sent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The house of endlesse paine is built thereby,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In which ten thousand sorts of punishment<br>
The cursed creatures doe eternally torment.<p>
 
Before the threshold dreadfull <i>Cerberus</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His three deformed heads did lay along,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Curled with thousand adders venemous,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And lilled forth his bloudie flaming tong:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
At them he gan to reare his bristles strong,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And felly gnarre, vntill dayes enemy<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did him appease; then downe his taile he hong<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And suffered them to passen quietly:<br>
For she in hell and heauen had power equally.<p>
 
There was <i>Ixion</i> turned on a wheele,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For daring tempt the Queene of heauen to sin;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And <i>Sisyphus</i> an huge round stone did reele<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Against an hill, ne might from labour lin;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
There thirstie <i>Tantalus</i> hong by the chin;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And <i>Tityus</i> fed a vulture on his maw;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Typhoeus</i> ioynts were stretched on a gin,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Theseus</i> condemned to endlesse slouth by law,<br>
And fifty sisters water in leake vessels draw.<p>
 
They all beholding worldly wights in place,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Leaue off their worke, vnmindfull of their smart,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To gaze on them; who forth by them doe pace,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Till they be come vnto the furthest part:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where was a Caue ywrought by wondrous art,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Deepe, darke, vneasie, dolefull, comfortlesse,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In which sad <i>&AElig;sculapius</i> farre a part<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Emprisond was in chaines remedilesse,<br>
For that <i>Hippolytus</i> rent corse he did redresse.<p>
 
<i>Hippolytus</i> a iolly huntsman was,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That wont in charet chace the foming Bore;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He all his Peeres in beautie did surpas,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Ladies loue as losse of time forbore:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His wanton stepdame loued him the more,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But when she saw her offred sweets refused<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her loue she turnd to hate, and him before<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His father fierce of treason false accused,<br>
And with her gealous termes his open eares abused.<p>
 
Who all in rage his Sea-god syre besought,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some cursed vengeance on his sonne to cast:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From surging gulf two monsters straight were brought,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With dread whereof his chasing steedes aghast,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both charet swift and huntsman ouercast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His goodly corps on ragged cliffs yrent,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was quite dismembred, and his members chast<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scattered on euery mountaine, as he went,<br>
That of <i>Hippolytus</i> was left no moniment.<p>
 
His cruell stepdame seeing what was donne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Her wicked dayes with wretched knife did end,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In death auowing th'innocence of her sonne.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which hearing his rash Syre, began to rend<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His haire, and hastie tongue, that did offend:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tho gathering vp the relicks of his smart<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
By <i>Dianes</i> meanes, who was <i>Hippolyts</i> frend,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Them brought to <i>&AElig;sculape</i>, that by his art<br>
Did heale them all againe, and ioyned euery part.<p>
 
Such wondrous science in mans wit to raine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
When <i>Ioue</i> auizd, that could the dead reuiue,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And fates expired could renew againe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of endlesse life he might him not depriue,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But vnto hell did thrust him downe aliue,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With flashing thunderbolt ywounded sore:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where long remaining, he did alwaies striue<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Himselfe wilth salues to health for to restore,<br>
And slake the heauenly fire, that raged euermore.<p>
 
There auncient Night arriuing, did alight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From her nigh wearie waine, and in her armes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To <i>&AElig;sculapius</i> brought the wounded knight:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whom hauing softly disarayd of armes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tho gan to him discouer all his harmes,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beseeching him with prayer, and with praise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
If either salues, or oyles, or herbes, or charmes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A fordonne wight from dore of death mote raise,<br>
He would at her request prolong her nephews daies.<p>
 
Ah Dame (quoth he) thou temptest me in vaine,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To dare the thing, which daily yet I rew,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the old cause of my continued paine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With like attempt to like end to renew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Is not enough, that thrust from heauen dew<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here endlesse penance for one fault I pay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But that redoubled crime with vengeance new<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thou biddest me to eeke?  Can Night defray<br>
The wrath of thundring <i>Ioue</i>, that rules both night and day?<p>
 
Not so (quoth she) but sith that heauens king<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From hope of heauen hath thee excluded quight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why fearest thou, that canst not hope for thing,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And fearest not, that more thee hurten might,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now in the powre of euerlasting Night?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Goe to then, &ocirc; thou farre renowmed sonne<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of great <i>Apollo</i>, shew thy famous might<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In medicine, that else hath to thee wonne<br>
Great paines, &amp; greater praise, both neuer to be donne.<p>
 
Her words preuaild: And then the learned leach<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His cunning hand gan to his wounds to lay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all things else, the which his art did teach:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which hauing seene, from thence arose away<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The mother of dread darknesse, and let stay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Aueugles</i> sonne there in the leaches cure,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And backe returning tooke her wonted way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
To runne her timely race, whilst <i>Phoebus</i> pure<br>
In westerne waues his wearie wagon did recure.<p>
 
The false <i>Duessa</i> leauing noyous Night,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Returnd to stately pallace of dame Pride;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where when she came, she found the Faery knight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Departed thence, albe his woundes wide<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not throughly heald, vnreadie were to ride.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good cause he had to hasten thence away;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For on a day his wary Dwarfe had spide,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where in a dongeon deepe huge numbers lay<br>
Of caytiue wretched thrals, that wayled night and day.<p>
 
A ruefull sight, as could be seene with eie;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of whom he learned had in secret wise<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hidden cause of their captiuitie,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
How mortgaging their liues to <i>Couetise</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through wastfull Pride, and wanton Riotise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
They were by law of that proud Tyrannesse<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prouokt with <i>VVrath</i>, and <i>Enuies</i> false surmise,<br>
Condemned to that Dongeon mercilesse,<br>
Where they should liue in woe, &amp; die in wretchednesse.<p>
 
There was that great proud king of <i>Babylon</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That would compell all nations to adore,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And him as onely God to call vpon,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Till through celestiall doome throwne out of dore,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Into an Oxe he was transform'd of yore:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
There also was king <i>Croesus</i>, that enhaunst<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
His heart too high through his great riches store;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And proud <i>Antiochus</i>, the which aduaunst<br>
His cursed hand gainst God, and on his altars daunst.<p>
 
And them long time before, great <i>Nimrod</i> was,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That first the world with sword and fire warrayd;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And after him old <i>Ninus</i> farre did pas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In princely pompe, of all the world obayd;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
There also was that mightie Monarch layd<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Low vnder all, yet aboue all in pride,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That name of natiue syre did fowle vpbrayd,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And would as <i>Ammons</i> sonne be magnifide,<br>
Till scornd of God and man a shamefull death he dide.<p>
 
All these together in one heape were throwne,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like carkases of beasts in butchers stall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And in another corner wide were strowne<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The antique ruines of the <i>Romaines</i> fall:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Great <i>Romulus</i> the Grandsyre of them all,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Proud <i>Tarquin</i>, and too lordly <i>Lentulus</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stout <i>Scipio</i>, and stubborne <i>Hanniball</i>,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ambitious <i>Sylla</i>, and sterne <i>Marius</i>,<br>
High <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, great <i>Pompey</i>, and fierce <i>Antonius</i>.<p>
 
Amongst these mighty men were wemen mixt,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Proud wemen, vaine, forgetfull of their yoke:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The bold <i>Semiramis</i>, whose sides transfixt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With sonnes owne blade, her fowle reproches spoke;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Faire <i>Sthenoboea</i>, that her selfe did choke<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With wilfull cord, for wanting of her will;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
High minded <i>Cleopatra</i>, that with stroke<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of Aspes sting her selfe did stoutly kill:<br>
And thousands moe the like, that did that dongeon fill.<p>
 
Besides the endlesse routs of wretched thralles,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which thither were assembled day by day,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
From all the world after their wofull falles,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Through wicked pride, and wasted wealthes decay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But most of all, which in the Dongeon lay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fell from high Princes courts, or Ladies bowres,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where they in idle pompe, or wanton play,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consumed had their goods, and thriftlesse howres,<br>
And lastly throwne themselues into these heauy stowres.<p>
 
Whose case when as the carefull Dwarfe had tould,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And made ensample of their mournefull sight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Vnto his maister, he no lenger would<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
There dwell in perill of like painefull plight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
But early rose, and ere that dawning light<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Discouered had the world to heauen wyde,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He by a priuie Posterne tooke his flight,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That of no enuious eyes he mote be spyde:<br>
For doubtlesse death ensewd, if any him descryde.<p>
 
Scarse could he footing find in that fowle way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For many corses, like a great Lay-stall<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of murdred men which therein strowed lay,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Without remorse, or decent funerall:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Which all through that great Princesse pride did fall<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
And came to shamefull end. And them beside<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forth ryding vnderneath the castell wall,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A donghill of dead carkases he spide,<br>
The dreadfull spectacle of that sad house of <i>Pride</i>.<p>

AS when a ship, that flyes faire vnder 
saile,<br>
An hidden rocke escaped hath vnwares,<br>
That lay in waite her wrack for to bewaile,<br>
The Marriner yet halfe amazed stares<br>
At perill past, and yet in doubt ne dares<br>
To ioy at his foole-happie ouersight:<br>
So doubly is distrest twixt ioy and cares<br>
The dreadlesse courage of this Elfin knight,<br>
Hauing escapt so sad ensamples in his sight.<p>
 
Yet sad he was that his too hastie speed<br>
The faire <i>Duess</i>' had forst him leaue behind;<br>
And yet more sad, that <i>Vna</i> his deare dreed<br>
Her truth had staind with treason so vnkind;<br>
Yet crime in her could neuer creature find,<br>
But for his loue, and for her owne selfe sake,<br>
She wandred had from one to other <i>Ynd</i>,<br>
Him for to seeke, ne euer would forsake,<br>
Till her vnwares the fierce <i>Sansloy</i> did ouertake.<p>
 
Who after <i>Archimagoes</i> fowle defeat,<br>
Led her away into a forrest wilde,<br>
And turning wrathfull fire to lustfull heat,<br>
With beastly sin thought her to haue defilde,<br>
And made the vassall of his pleasures vilde.<br>
Yet first he cast by treatie, and by traynes,<br>
Her to perswade, that stubborne fort to yilde:<br>
For greater conquest of hard loue he gaynes,<br>
That workes it to his will, then he that it constraines.<p>
 
With fawning wordes he courted her a while,<br>
And looking louely, and oft sighing sore,<br>
Her constant hart did tempt with diuerse guile:<br>
But wordes, and lookes, and sighes she did abhore,<br>
As rocke of Diamond stedfast euermore.<br>
Yet for to feed his fyrie lustfull eye,<br>
He snatcht the vele, that hong her face before;<br>
Then gan her beautie shine, as brightest skye,<br>
And burnt his beastly hart t'efforce her chastitye.<p>
 
So when he saw his flatt'ring arts to fayle,<br>
And subtile engines bet from batteree,<br>
With greedy force he gan the fort assayle,<br>
Whereof he weend possessed soone to bee,<br>
And win rich spoile of ransackt chastetee.<br>
Ah heauens, that do this hideous act behold,<br>
And heauenly virgin thus outraged see,<br>
How can ye vengeance iust so long withhold,<br>
And hurle not flashing flames vpon that Paynim bold?<p>
 
The pitteous maiden carefull comfortlesse,<br>
Does throw out thrilling shriekes, &amp; shrieking cryes,<br>
The last vaine helpe of womens great distresse,<br>
And with loud plaints importuneth the skyes,<br>
That molten starres do drop like weeping eyes;<br>
And <i>Phoebus</i> flying so most shamefull sight,<br>
His blushing face in foggy cloud implyes,<br>
And hides for shame. What wit of mortall wight<br>
Can now deuise to quit a thrall from such a plight?<p>
 
Eternall prouidence exceeding thought,<br>
Where none appeares can make her selfe a way:<br>
A wondrous way it for this Lady wrought,<br>
From Lyons clawes to pluck the griped pray.<br>
Her shrill outcryes and shriekes so loud did bray,<br>
That all the woodes and forestes did resownd;<br>
A troupe of <i>Faunes</i> and <i>Satyres</i> far away<br>
Within the wood were dauncing in a rownd,<br>
Whiles old <i>Syluanus</i> slept in shady arber sownd.<p>
 
Who when they heard that pitteous strained voice,<br>
In hast forsooke their rurall meriment,<br>
And ran towards the far rebownded noyce,<br>
To weet, what wight so loudly did lament.<br>
Vnto the place they come incontinent:<br>
Whom when the raging Sarazin espide,<br>
A rude, misshapen, monstrous rablement,<br>
Whose like he neuer saw, he durst not bide,<br>
But got his ready steed, and fast away gan ride.<p>
 
The wyld woodgods arriued in the place,<br>
There find the virgin dolefull desolate,<br>
With ruffled rayments, and faire blubbred face,<br>
As her outrageous foe had left her late,<br>
And trembling yet through feare of former hate;<br>
All stand amazed at so vncouth sight,<br>
And gin to pittie her vnhappie state,<br>
All stand astonied at her beautie bright,<br>
In their rude eyes vnworthie of so wofull plight.<p>
 
She more amaz'd, in double dread doth dwell;<br>
And euery tender part for feare does shake:<br>
As when a greedie Wolfe through hunger fell<br>
A seely Lambe farre from the flocke does take,<br>
Of whom he meanes his bloudie feast to make,<br>
A Lyon spyes fast running towards him,<br>
The innocent pray in hast he does forsake,<br>
Which quit from death yet quakes in euery lim<br>
With chaunge of feare, to see the Lyon looke so grim.<p>
 
Such fearefull fit assaid her trembling hart,<br>
Ne word to speake, ne ioynt to moue she had:<br>
The saluage nation feele her secret smart,<br>
And read her sorrow in her count'nance sad;<br>
Their frowning forheads with rough hornes yclad,<br>
And rusticke horror all a side doe lay,<br>
And gently grenning, shew a semblance glad<br>
To comfort her, and feare to put away,<br>
Their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obay.<p>
 
The doubtfull Damzell dare not yet commit<br>
Her single person to their barbarous truth,<br>
But still twixt feare and hope amazd does sit,<br>
Late learnd what harme to hastie trust ensu'th,<br>
They in compassion of her tender youth,<br>
And wonder of her beautie soueraine,<br>
Are wonne with pitty and vnwonted ruth,<br>
And all prostrate vpon the lowly plaine,<br>
Do kisse her feete, and fawne on her with count'nance faine.<p>
 
Their harts she ghesseth by their humble guise,<br>
And yieldes her to extremitie of time;<br>
So from the ground she fearelesse doth arise,<br>
And walketh forth without suspect of crime:<br>
They all as glad, as birdes of ioyous Prime,<br>
Thence lead her forth, about her dauncing round,<br>
Shouting, and singing all a shepheards ryme,<br>
And with greene braunches strowing all the ground,<br>
Do worship her, as Queene, with oliue girlond cround.<p>
 
And all the way their merry pipes they sound,<br>
That all the woods with doubled Eccho ring,<br>
And with their horned feet do weare the ground,<br>
Leaping like wanton kids in pleasant Spring.<br>
So towards old <i>Syluanus</i> they her bring;<br>
Who with the noyse awaked, commeth out,<br>
To weet the cause, his weake steps gouerning,<br>
And aged limbs on Cypresse stadle stout,<br>
And with an yuie twyne his wast is girt about.<p>
 
Far off he wonders, what them makes so glad,<br>
If <i>Bacchus</i> merry fruit they did inuent,<br>
Or <i>Cybeles</i> franticke rites haue made them mad;<br>
They drawing nigh, vnto their God present<br>
That flowre of faith and beautie excellent.<br>
The God himselfe vewing that mirrhour rare,<br>
Stood long amazd, and burnt in his intent;<br>
His owne faire <i>Dryope</i> now he thinkes not faire,<br>
And <i>Pholoe</i> fowle, when her to this he doth compaire.<p>
 
The woodborne people fall before her flat,<br>
And worship her as Goddesse of the wood;<br>
And old <i>Syluanus</i> selfe bethinkes not, what<br>
To thinke of wight so faire, but gazing stood,<br>
In doubt to deeme her borne of earthly brood;<br>
Sometimes Dame <i>Venus</i> selfe he seemes to see,<br>
But <i>Venus</i> neuer had so sober mood;<br>
Sometimes <i>Diana</i> he her takes to bee,<br>
But misseth bow, and shaftes, and buskins to her knee.<p>
 
By vew of her he ginneth to reuiue<br>
His ancient loue, and dearest <i>Cyparisse</i>,<br>
And calles to mind his pourtraiture aliue,<br>
How faire he was, and yet not faire to this,<br>
And how he slew with glauncing dart amisse<br>
A gentle Hynd, the which the louely boy<br>
Did loue as life, aboue all worldly blisse;<br>
For griefe whereof the lad n'ould after ioy,<br>
But pynd away in anguish and selfe-wild annoy.<p>
 
The wooddy Nymphes, faire <i>Hamadryades</i><br>
Her to behold do thither runne apace,<br>
And all the troupe of light-foot <i>Naiades</i>,<br>
Flocke all about to see her louely face:<br>
But when they vewed haue her heauenly grace,<br>
They enuie her in their malitious mind,<br>
And fly away for feare of fowle disgrace:<br>
But all the <i>Satyres</i> scorne their woody kind,<br>
And henceforth nothing faire, but her on earth they find.<p>
 
Glad of such lucke, the luckelesse lucky maid,<br>
Did her content to please their feeble eyes,<br>
And long time with that saluage people staid,<br>
To gather breath in many miseries.<br>
During which time her gentle wit she plyes,<br>
To teach them truth, which worshipt her in vaine,<br>
And made her th'Image of Idolatryes;<br>
But when their bootlesse zeale she did restraine<br>
Fr&otilde; her own worship, they her Asse would worship fayn.<p>
 
It fortuned a noble warlike knight<br>
By iust occasion to that forrest came,<br>
To seeke his kindred, and the lignage right,<br>
From whence he tooke his well deserued name:<br>
He had in armes abroad wonne muchell fame,<br>
And fild far landes with glorie of his might,<br>
Plaine, faithfull, true, and enimy of shame,<br>
And euer lou'd to fight for Ladies right,<br>
But in vaine glorious frayes he litle did delight.<p>
 
A Satyres sonne yborne in forrest wyld,<br>
By straunge aduenture as it did betyde,<br>
And there begotten of a Lady myld,<br>
Faire <i>Thyamis</i> the daughter of <i>Labryde</i>,<br>
That was in sacred bands of wedlocke tyde<br>
To <i>Therion</i>, a loose vnruly swayne;<br>
Who had more ioy to raunge the forrest wyde,<br>
And chase the saluage beast with busie payne,<br>
Then serue his Ladies loue, and wast in pleasures vayne.<p>
 
The forlorne mayd did with loues longing burne,<br>
And could not lacke her louers company,<br>
But to the wood she goes, to serue her turne,<br>
And seeke her spouse, that from her still does fly,<br>
And followes other game and venery:<br>
A Satyre chaunst her wandring for to find,<br>
And kindling coles of lust in brutish eye,<br>
The loyall links of wedlocke did vnbind,<br>
And made her person thrall vnto his beastly kind.<p>
 
So long in secret cabin there he held<br>
Her captiue to his sensuall desire,<br>
Till that with timely fruit her belly sweld,<br>
And bore a boy vnto that saluage sire:<br>
Then home he suffred her for to retire,<br>
For ransome leauing him the late borne childe;<br>
Whom till to ryper yeares he gan aspire,<br>
He noursled vp in life and manners wilde,<br>
Emongst wild beasts and woods, from lawes of men exilde.<p>
 
For all he taught the tender ymp, was but<br>
To banish cowardize and bastard feare;<br>
His trembling hand he would him force to put<br>
Vpon the Lyon and the rugged Beare,<br>
And from the she Beares teats her whelps to teare;<br>
And eke wyld roring Buls he would him make<br>
To tame, and ryde their backes not made to beare;<br>
And the Robuckes in flight to ouertake,<br>
That euery beast for feare of him did fly and quake.<p>
 
Thereby so fearelesse, and so fell he grew,<br>
That his owne sire and maister of his guise<br>
Did often tremble at his horrid vew,<br>
And oft for dread of hurt would him aduise,<br>
The angry beasts not rashly to despise,<br>
Nor too much to prouoke; for he would learne<br>
The Lyon stoup to him in lowly wise,<br>
(A lesson hard) and make the Libbard sterne<br>
Leaue roaring, when in rage he for reuenge did earne.<p>
 
And for to make his powre approued more,<br>
Wyld beasts in yron yokes he would compell;<br>
The spotted Panther, and the tusked Bore,<br>
The Pardale swift, and the Tigre cruell;<br>
The Antelope, and Wolfe both fierce and fell;<br>
And them constraine in equall teme to draw.<br>
Such ioy he had, their stubborne harts to quell,<br>
And sturdie courage tame with dreadfull aw,<br>
That his beheast they feared, as tyrans law, <p>
 
His louing mother came vpon a day<br>
Vnto the woods, to see her little sonne;<br>
And chaunst vnwares to meet him in the way,<br>
After his sportes, and cruell pastime donne,<br>
When after him a Lyonesse did runne,<br>
That roaring all with rage, did lowd requere<br>
Her children deare, whom he away had wonne:<br>
The Lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare,<br>
And lull in rugged armes, withouten childish feare.<p>
 
The fearefull Dame all quaked at the sight,<br>
And turning backe, gan fast to fly away,<br>
Vntill with loue reuokt from vaine affright,<br>
She hardly yet perswaded was to stay,<br>
And then to him these womanish words gan say;<br>
Ah <i>Satyrane</i>, my dearling, and my ioy,<br>
For loue of me leaue off this dreadfull play;<br>
To dally thus with death, is no fit toy,<br>
Go find some other play-fellowes, mine own sweet boy.<p>
 
In these and like delights of bloudy game<br>
He trayned was, till ryper yeares he raught,<br>
And there abode, whilst any beast of name<br>
Walkt in that forest, whom he had not taught<br>
To feare his force: and then his courage haught<br>
Desird of forreine foemen to be knowne,<br>
And far abroad for straunge aduentures sought:<br>
In which his might was neuer ouerthrowne,<br>
But through all Faery lond his famous worth was blown.<p>
 
Yet euermore it was his manner faire,<br>
After long labours and aduentures spent,<br>
Vnto those natiue woods for to repaire,<br>
To see his sire and offspring auncient.<br>
And now he thither came for like intent;<br>
Where he vnwares the fairest <i>Vna</i> found,<br>
Straunge Lady, in so straunge habiliment,<br>
Teaching the Satyres, which her sat around,<br>
Trew sacred lore, which from her sweet lips did redound.<p>
 
He wondred at her wisedome heauenly rare,<br>
Whose like in womens wit he neuer knew;<br>
And when her curteous deeds he did compare,<br>
Gan her admire, and her sad sorrowes rew,<br>
Blaming of Fortune, which such troubles threw,<br>
And ioyd to make proofe of her crueltie<br>
On gentle Dame, so hurtlesse, and so trew:<br>
Thenceforth he kept her goodly company,<br>
And learnd her discipline of faith and veritie.<p>
 
But she all vowd vnto the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
His wandring perill closely did lament,<br>
Ne in this new acquaintaunce could delight,<br>
But her deare heart with anguish did torment,<br>
And all her wit in secret counsels spent,<br>
How to escape. At last in priuie wise<br>
To <i>Satyrane</i> she shewed her intent:<br>
Who glad to gain such fauour, gan deuise,<br>
How with that pensiue Maid he best might thence arise.<p>
 
So on a day when Satyres all were gone,<br>
To do their seruice to <i>Syluanus</i> old,<br>
The gentle virgin left behind alone<br>
He led away with courage stout and bold.<br>
Too late it was, to Satyres to be told,<br>
Or euer hope recouer her againe:<br>
In vaine he seekes that hauing cannot hold.<br>
So fast he carried her with carefull paine,<br>
That they the woods are past, &amp; come now to the plaine.<p>
 
The better part now of the lingring day,<br>
They traueild had, when as they farre espide<br>
A wearie wight forwandring by the way,<br>
And towards him they gan in hast to ride,<br>
To weet of newes, that did abroad betide,<br>
Or tydings of her knight of the <i>Redcrosse</i>.<br>
But he them spying, gan to turne aside,<br>
For feare as seemd, or for some feigned losse;<br>
More greedy they of newes, fast towards him do crosse.<p>
 
A silly man, in simple weedes forworne,<br>
And soild with dust of the long dried way;<br>
His sandales were with toilesome trauell torne,<br>
And face all tand with scorching sunny ray,<br>
As he had traueild many a sommers day,<br>
Through boyling sands of <i>Arabie</i> and <i>Ynde</i>;<br>
And in his hand a <i>Iacobs</i> staffe, to stay<br>
His wearie limbes vpon: and eke behind,<br>
His scrip did hang, in which his needments he did bind.<p>
 
The knight approching nigh, of him inquerd<br>
Tydings of warre, and of aduentures new;<br>
But warres, nor new aduentures none he herd.<br>
Then <i>Vna</i> gan to aske, if ought he knew,<br>
Or heard abroad of that her champion trew,<br>
That in his armour bare a croslet red.<br>
Aye me, Deare dame (quoth he) well may I rew<br>
To tell the sad sight, which mine eies haue red:<br>
These eyes did see that knight both liuing and eke ded.<p>
 
That cruell word her tender hart so thrild,<br>
That suddein cold did runne through euery vaine,<br>
And stony horrour all her sences fild<br>
With dying fit, that downe she fell for paine.<br>
The knight her lightly reared vp againe,<br>
And comforted with curteous kind reliefe:<br>
Then wonne from death, she bad him tellen plaine<br>
The further processe of her hidden griefe;<br>
The lesser pangs can beare, who hath endur'd the chiefe.<p>
 
Then gan the Pilgrim thus, I chaunst this day,<br>
This fatall day, that shall I euer rew,<br>
To see two knights in trauell on my way<br>
(A sory sight) arraung'd in battell new,<br>
Both breathing vengeaunce, both of wrathfull hew:<br>
My fearefull flesh did tremble at their strife,<br>
To see their blades so greedily imbrew,<br>
That drunke with bloud, yet thristed after life:<br>
What more? the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight was slaine with Paynim knife.<p>
 
Ah dearest Lord (quoth she) how might that bee,<br>
And he the stoutest knight, that euer wonne?<br>
Ah dearest dame (quoth he) how might I see<br>
The thing, that might not be, and yet was donne?<br>
Where is (said <i>Satyrane</i>) that Paynims sonne,<br>
That him of life, and vs of ioy hath reft?<br>
Not far away (quoth he) he hence doth wonne<br>
Foreby a fountaine, where I late him left<br>
Washing his bloudy wounds, that through the steele were cleft.<p>
 
Therewith the knight thence marched forth in hast,<br>
Whiles <i>Vna</i> with huge heauinesse opprest,<br>
Could not for sorrow follow him so fast;<br>
And soone he came, as he the place had ghest,<br>
Whereas that <i>Pagan</i> proud him selfe did rest,<br>
In secret shadow by a fountaine side:<br>
Euen he it was, that earst would haue supprest<br>
Faire <i>Vna</i>: whom when <i>Satyrane</i> espide,<br>
With fowle reprochfull words he boldly him defide.<p>
 
And said, Arise thou cursed Miscreaunt,<br>
That hast with knightlesse guile and trecherous train<br>
Faire knighthood fowly shamed, and doest vaunt<br>
That good knight of the <i>Redcrosse</i> to haue slain:<br>
Arise, and with like treason now maintain<br>
Thy guilty wrong, or else thee guilty yield.<br>
The Sarazin this hearing, rose amain,<br>
And catching vp in hast his three square shield,<br>
And shining helmet, soone him buckled to the field.<p>
 
And drawing nigh him said, Ah misborne Elfe,<br>
In euill houre thy foes thee hither sent,<br>
Anothers wrongs to wreake vpon thy selfe:<br>
Yet ill thou blamest me, for hauing blent<br>
My name with guile and traiterous intent;<br>
That <i>Redcrosse</i> knight, perdie, I neuer slew,<br>
But had he beene, where earst his armes were lent,<br>
Th'enchaunter vaine his errour should not rew:<br>
But thou his errour shalt, I hope now prouen trew.<p>
 
Therewith they gan, both furious and fell,<br>
To thunder blowes, and fiersly to assaile<br>
Each other bent his enimy to quell,<br>
That with their force they perst both plate and maile,<br>
And made wide furrowes in their fleshes fraile,<br>
That it would pitty any liuing eie.<br>
Large floods of bloud adowne their sides did raile;<br>
But floods of bloud could not them satisfie:<br>
Both hungred after death: both chose to win, or die.<p>
 
So long they fight, and fell reuenge pursue,<br>
That fainting each, themselues to breathen let,<br>
And oft refreshed, battell oft renue:<br>
As when two Bores with rancling malice met,<br>
Their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret,<br>
Til breathlesse both them selues aside retire,<br>
Where foming wrath, their cruell tuskes they whet,<br>
And trample th'earth, the whiles they may respire;<br>
Then backe to fight againe, new breathed and entire.<p>
 
So fiersly, when these knights had breathed once,<br>
They gan to fight returne, increasing more<br>
Their puissant force, and cruell rage attonce,<br>
With heaped strokes more hugely, then before,<br>
That with their drerie wounds and bloudy gore<br>
They both deformed, scarsely could be known.<br>
By this sad <i>Vna</i> fraught with anguish sore,<br>
Led with their noise, which through the aire was thrown:<br>
Arriu'd, where they in erth their fruitles bloud had sown.<p>
 
Whom all so soone as that proud Sarazin<br>
Espide, he gan reuiue the memory<br>
Of his lewd lusts, and late attempted sin,<br>
And left the doubtfull battell hastily,<br>
To catch her, newly offred to his eie:<br>
But <i>Satyrane</i> with strokes him turning, staid,<br>
And sternely bad him other businesse plie,<br>
Then hunt the steps of pure vnspotted Maid:<br>
Wherewith he all enrag'd, these bitter speaches said.<p>
 
O foolish faeries sonne, what furie mad<br>
Hath thee incenst, to hast thy dolefull fate?<br>
Were it not better, I that Lady had,<br>
Then that thou hadst repented it too late?<br>
Most sencelesse man he, that himselfe doth hate,<br>
To loue another. Lo then for thine ayd<br>
Here take thy louers token on thy pate.<br>
So they to fight; the whiles the royall Mayd<br>
Fled farre away, of that proud Paynim sore afrayd.<p>
 
But that false <i>Pilgrim</i>, which that leasing told,<br>
Being in deed old <i>Archimage</i>, did stay<br>
In secret shadow, all this to behold,<br>
And much reioyced in their bloudy fray:<br>
But when he saw the Damsell passe away<br>
He left his stond, and her pursewd apace,<br>
In hope to bring her to her last decay.<br>
But for to tell her lamentable cace,<br>
And eke this battels end, will need another place.<p>
