KNIGHT OF THE RED CROSSE,<br> <i>OR</i><br> OF HOLINESSE.</center><p> 

<blockquote> 
LO I the man, whose Muse whilome did maske,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
As time her taught, in lowly Shepheards weeds,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Am now enforst a far vnfitter taske,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
For trumpets sterne to chaunge mine Oaten reeds,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And sing of Knights and Ladies gentle deeds;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Whose prayses hauing slept in silence long,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Me, all too meane, the sacred Muse areeds<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To blazon broad emongst her learned throng:<br>
Fierce warres and faithfull loues shall moralize my song.<p>
 
Helpe then, &ocirc; holy Virgin chiefe of nine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Thy weaker Nouice to performe thy will,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Lay forth out of thine euerlasting scryne<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The antique rolles, which there lye hidden still,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Of Faerie knights and fairest <i>Tanaquill</i>,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Whom that most noble Briton Prince so long<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Sought through the world, and suffered so much ill,<br>
That I must rue his vndeserued wrong:<br>
O helpe thou my weake wit, and sharpen my dull tong.<p>
 
And thou most dreaded impe of highest <i>Ioue</i>,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Faire <i>Venus</i> sonne, that with thy cruell dart<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
At that good knight so cunningly didst roue,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
That glorious fire it kindled in his hart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Lay now thy deadly Heben bow apart,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And with thy mother milde come to mine ayde:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Come both, and with you bring triumphant <i>Mart</i>,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In loues and gentle iollities arrayd,<br>
After his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd.<p>
 
And with them eke, O Goddesse heauenly bright,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Mirrour of grace and Maiestie diuine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Great Lady of the greatest Isle, whose light<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Like <i>Phoebus</i> lampe throughout the world doth shine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
And raise my thoughts too humble and too vile,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
To thinke of that true glorious type of thine,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
The argument of mine afflicted stile:<br>
The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.<p>
