<blockquote> 
<i>Vaine Braggadocchio getting Guyons<br>
horse is made the scorne<br>
Of knighthood trew, and is of fayre<br>
Belphoebe fowle forlorne.</i><p>
</blockquote> 

 
<p>
<blockquote> 
S
Oone as the morrow faire with purple beames<br>
Disperst the shadowes of the mistie night,<br>
And <i>Titan</i> playing on the eastern streames,<br>
cleare the deawy ayre with springing light,<br>
Sir <i>Guyon</i> mindfull of his vow yplight,<br>
Vprose from drowsie couch, and him addrest<br>
Vnto the iourney which he had behight:<br>
His puissaunt armes about his noble brest,<br>
And many-folded shield he bound about his wrest.<p>
 
Then taking <i>Cong&eacute;</i> of that virgin pure,<br>
The bloudy-handed babe vnto her truth<br>
Did earnestly commit, and her coniure,<br>
In vertuous lore to traine his tender youth,<br>
And all that gentle noriture ensu'th:<br>
And that so soone as ryper yeares he raught,<br>
He might for memorie of that dayes ruth,<br>
Be called <i>Ruddymane</i>, and thereby taught,<br>
T'auenge his Par&#7869;ts death on them, that had it wrought.<p>
 
So forth he far'd, as now befell, on foot,<br>
Sith his good steed is lately from him gone;<br>
Patience perforce; helpelesse what may it boot<br>
To fret for anger, or for griefe to mone?<br>
His Palmer now shall foot no more alone:<br>
So fortune wrought, as vnder greene woods syde<br>
He lately heard that dying Lady grone,<br>
He left his steed without, and speare besyde,<br>
And rushed in on foot to ayd her, ere she dyde.<p>
 
The whiles a losell wandring by the way,<br>
One that to bountie neuer cast his mind,<br>
Ne thought of honour euer did assay<br>
His baser brest, but in his kestrell kind<br>
A pleasing vaine of glory vaine did find,<br>
To which his flowing toung, and troublous spright<br>
Gaue him great ayd, and made him more inclind:<br>
He that braue steed there finding ready dight,<br>
Purloynd both steed and speare, and ran away full light.<p>
 
Now gan his hart all swell in iollitie,<br>
And of him selfe great hope and helpe conceiu'd,<br>
That puffed vp with smoke of vanitie,<br>
And with selfe-loued personage deceiu'd,<br>
He gan to hope, of men to be receiu'd<br>
For such, as he him thought, or faine would bee:<br>
But for in court gay portaunce he perceiu'd,<br>
And gallant shew to be in greatest gree,<br>
Eftsoones to court he cast t'auaunce his first degree.<p>
 
And by the way he chaunced to espy<br>
One sitting idle on a sunny bancke,<br>
To whom auaunting in great brauery,<br>
As Peacocke, that his painted plumes doth prancke,<br>
He smote his courser in the trembling flancke,<br>
And to him threatned his hart-thrilling speare:<br>
The seely man seeing him ryde so rancke,<br>
And ayme at him, fell flat to ground for feare,<br>
And crying Mercy lowd, his pitious hands gan reare.<p>
 
Thereat the Scarcrow wexed wondrous prowd,<br>
Through fortune of his first aduenture faire,<br>
And with big thundring voyce reuyld him lowd;<br>
Vile Caytiue, vassall of dread and despaire,<br>
Vnworthie of the commune breathed aire,<br>
Why liuest thou, dead dog, a lenger day,<br>
And doest not vnto death thy selfe prepaire.<br>
Dye, or thy selfe my captiue yield for ay;<br>
Great fauour I thee graunt, for aunswere thus to stay.<p>
 
Hold, &ocirc; deare Lord, hold your dead-doing hand,<br>
Then loud he cryde, I am your humble thrall.<br>
Ah wretch (quoth he) thy destinies withstand<br>
My wrathfull will, and do for mercy call.<br>
I giue thee life: therefore prostrated fall,<br>
And kisse my stirrup; that thy homage bee.<br>
The Miser threw him selfe, as an Offall,<br>
Streight at his foot in base humilitee,<br>
And cleeped him his liege, to hold of him in fee.<p>
 
So happy peace they made and faire accord:<br>
Eftsoones this liege-man gan to wexe more bold,<br>
And when he felt the folly of his Lord,<br>
In his owne kind he gan him selfe vnfold:<br>
For he was wylie witted, and growne old<br>
In cunning sleights and practick knauery.<br>
From that day forth he cast for to vphold<br>
His idle humour with fine flattery,<br>
And blow the bellowes to his swelling vanity.<p>
 
<i>Trompart</i> fit man for <i>Braggadocchio</i>,<br>
To serue at court in view of vaunting eye;<br>
Vaine-glorious man, when fluttring wind does blow<br>
In his light wings, is lifted vp to skye:<br>
The scorne of knighthood and trew cheualrye,<br>
To thinke without desert of gentle deed,<br>
And noble worth to be aduaunced hye:<br>
Such prayse is shame; but honour vertues meed<br>
Doth beare the fairest flowre in honorable seed.<p>
 
So forth they pas, a well consorted paire,<br>
Till that at length with <i>Archimage</i> they meet:<br>
Who seeing one that shone in armour faire,<br>
On goodly courser thundring with his feet,<br>
Eftsoones supposed him a person meet,<br>
Of his reuenge to make the instrument:<br>
For since the <i>Redcrosse</i> knight he earst did weet,<br>
To beene with <i>Guyon</i> knit in one consent,<br>
The ill, which earst to him, he now to <i>Guyon</i> ment.<p>
 
And comming close to <i>Trompart</i> gan inquere<br>
Of him, what mighty warriour that mote bee,<br>
That rode in golden sell with single spere,<br>
But wanted sword to wreake his enmitee.<br>
He is a great aduenturer, (said he)<br>
That hath his sword through hard assay forgone,<br>
And now hath vowd, till he auenged bee,<br>
Of that despight, neuer to wearen none;<br>
That speare is him enough to doen a thousand grone.<p>
 
Th'enchaunter greatly ioyed in the vaunt,<br>
And weened well ere long his will to win,<br>
And both his foen with equall foyle to daunt.<br>
Tho to him louting lowly, did begin<br>
To plaine of wrongs, which had committed bin<br>
By <i>Guyon</i>, and by that false <i>Redcrosse</i> knight,<br>
Which two through treason and deceiptfull gin,<br>
Had slaine Sir <i>Mordant</i>, and his Lady bright:<br>
That mote him honour win, to wreake so foule despight.<p>
 
Therewith all suddeinly he seemd enraged,<br>
And threatned death with dreadfull countenaunce,<br>
As if their liues had in his hand beene gaged;<br>
And with stiffe force shaking his mortall launce,<br>
To let him weet his doughtie valiaunce,<br>
Thus said; Old man, great sure shalbe thy meed,<br>
If where those knights for feare of dew vengeaunce<br>
Do lurke, thou certainly to me areed,<br>
That I may wreake on them their hainous hatefull deed.<p>
 
Certes, my Lord, (said he) that shall I soone,<br>
And giue you eke good helpe to their decay,<br>
But mote I wisely you aduise to doon;<br>
Giue no ods to your foes, but do puruay<br>
Your selfe of sword before that bloudy day:<br>
For they be two the prowest knights on ground,<br>
And oft approu'd in many hard assay,<br>
And eke of surest steele, that may be found,<br>
Do arme your selfe against that day, them to confound.<p>
 
Dotard (said he) let be thy deepe aduise;<br>
Seemes that through many yeares thy wits thee faile,<br>
And that weake eld hath left thee nothing wise,<br>
Else neuer should thy iudgement be so fraile,<br>
To measure manhood by the sword or maile.<br>
Is not enough foure quarters of a man,<br>
Withouten sword or shield, an host to quaile?<br>
Thou little wotest, what this right hand can:<br>
Speake they, which haue beheld the battailes, which it wan.<p>
 
The man was much abashed at his boast;<br>
Yet well he wist, that who so would contend<br>
With either of those knights on euen coast,<br>
Should need of all his armes, him to defend;<br>
Yet feared least his boldnesse should offend,<br>
When <i>Braggadocchio</i> said, Once I did sweare,<br>
When with one sword seuen knights I brought to end,<br>
Thence forth in battell neuer sword to beare,<br>
But it were that, which noblest knight on earth doth weare.<p>
 
Perdie Sir knight, said then th'enchaunter bliue,<br>
That shall I shortly purchase to your hond:<br>
For now the best and noblest knight aliue<br>
Prince <i>Arthur</i> is, that wonnes in Faerie lond;<br>
He hath a sword, that flames like burning brond.<br>
The same by my deuice I vndertake<br>
Shall by to morrow by thy side be fond.<br>
At which bold word that boaster gan to quake,<br>
And wondred in his mind, what mote that monster make.<p>
 
He stayd not for more bidding, but away<br>
Was suddein vanished out of his sight:<br>
The Northerne wind his wings did broad display<br>
At his commaund, and reared him vp light<br>
From off the earth to take his aerie flight.<br>
They lookt about, but no where could espie<br>
Tract of his foot: then dead through great affright<br>
They both nigh were, and each bad other flie:<br>
Both fled attonce, ne euer backe returned eie.<p>
 
Till that they come vnto a forrest greene,<br>
In which they shrowd th&#7869;selues from causelesse feare;<br>
Yet feare them followes still, where so they beene,<br>
Each trembling leafe, and whistling wind they heare,<br>
As ghastly bug their haire on end does reare:<br>
Yet both doe striue their fearfulnesse to faine.<br>
At last they heard a horne, that shrilled cleare<br>
Throughout the wood, that ecchoed againe,<br>
And made the forrest ring, as it would riue in twaine.<p>
 
Eft through the thicke they heard one rudely rush;<br>
With noyse whereof he from his loftie steed<br>
Downe fell to ground, and crept into a bush,<br>
To hide his coward head from dying dreed.<br>
But <i>Trompart</i> stoutly stayd to taken heed,<br>
Of what might hap.  Eftsoone there stepped forth<br>
A goodly Ladie clad in hunters weed,<br>
That seemd to be a woman of great worth,<br>
And by her stately portance, borne of heauenly birth.<p>
 
Her face so faire as flesh it seemed not,<br>
But heauenly pourtraict of bright Angels hew,<br>
Cleare as the skie, withouten blame or blot,<br>
Through goodly mixture of complexions dew;<br>
And in her cheekes the vermeill red did shew<br>
Like roses in a bed of lillies shed,<br>
The which ambrosiall odours from them threw,<br>
And gazers sense with double pleasure fed,<br>
Hable to heale the sicke, and to reuiue the ded.<p>
 
In her faire eyes two liuing lamps did flame,<br>
Kindled aboue at th'heauenly makers light,<br>
And darted fyrie beames out of the same,<br>
So passing persant, and so wondrous bright,<br>
That quite bereau'd the rash beholders sight:<br>
In them the blinded god his lustfull fire<br>
To kindle oft assayd, but had no might;<br>
For with dredd Maiestie, and awfull ire,<br>
She broke his wanton darts, and quenched base desire.<p>
 
Her iuorie forhead, full of bountie braue,<br>
Like a broad table did it selfe dispred,<br>
For Loue his loftie triumphes to engraue,<br>
And write the battels of his great godhed:<br>
All good and honour might therein be red:<br>
For there their dwelling was.  And when she spake,<br>
Sweet words, like dropping honny she did shed,<br>
And twixt the perles and rubins softly brake<br>
A siluer sound, that heauenly musicke seemd to make.<p>
 
Vpon her eyelids many Graces sate,<br>
Vnder the shadow of her euen browes,<br>
Working belgards, and amorous retrate,<br>
And euery one her with a grace endowes:<br>
And euery one with meekenesse to her bowes.<br>
So glorious mirrhour of celestiall grace,<br>
And soueraine moniment of mortall vowes,<br>
How shall fraile pen descriue her heauenly face,<br>
For feare through want of skill her beautie to disgrace?<p>
 
So faire, and thousand thousand times more faire<br>
She seemd, when she presented was to sight,<br>
And was yclad, for heat of scorching aire,<br>
All in a silken Camus lylly whight,<br>
Purfled vpon with many a folded plight,<br>
Which all aboue besprinckled was throughout,<br>
With golden aygulets, that glistred bright,<br>
Like twinckling starres, and all the skirt about<br>
Was hemd with golden fringe<p>
 
Below her ham her weed were somewhat traine,<br>
And her streight legs most brauely were embayld<br>
In gilden buskins of costly Cordwaine,<br>
All bard with golden bendes, which were entayld<br>
With curious antickes, and full faire aumayld:<br>
Before they fastned were vnder her knee<br>
In a rich Iewell, and therein entrayld<br>
The ends of all their knots, that none might see,<br>
How they within their fouldings close enwrapped bee.<p>
 
Like two faire marble pillours they were seene,<br>
Which doe the temple of the Gods support,<br>
Whom all the people decke with girlands greene,<br>
And honour in their festiuall resort;<br>
Those same with stately grace, and princely port<br>
She taught to tread, when she her selfe would grace,<br>
But with the wooddie Nymphes when she did play,<br>
Or when the flying Libbard she did chace,<br>
She could them nimbly moue, and after fly apace.<p>
 
And in her hand a sharpe bore-speare she held,<br>
And at her backe a bow and quiuer gay,<br>
Stuft with steele-headed darts, wherewith she queld<br>
The saluage beastes in her victorious play,<br>
Knit with a golden bauldricke, which forelay<br>
Athwart her snowy brest, and did diuide<br>
Her daintie paps; which like young fruit in May<br>
Now little gan to swell, and being tide,<br>
Through her thin weed their places only signifide.<p>
 
Her yellow lockes crisped, like golden wyre,<br>
About her shoulders weren loosely shed,<br>
And when the winde emongst them did inspyre,<br>
They waued like a penon wide dispred,<br>
And low behinde her backe were scattered:<br>
And whether art it were, or heedlesse hap,<br>
As through the flouring forrest rash she fled,<br>
In her rude haires sweet flowres themselues did lap,<br>
And flourishing fresh leaues and blossomes did enwrap.<p>
 
Such as <i>Diana</i> by the sandie shore<br>
Of swift <i>Eurotas</i>, or on <i>Cynthus</i> greene,<br>
Where all the Nymphes haue her vnwares forlore,<br>
Wandreth alone with bow and arrowes keene,<br>
To seeke her game: Or as that famous Queene<br>
Of <i>Amazons</i>, whom <i>Pyrrhus</i> did destroy,<br>
The day that first of <i>Priame</i> she was seene,<br>
Did shew her selfe in great triumphant ioy,<br>
To succour the weake state of sad afflicted <i>Troy</i>.<p>
 
Such when as hartlesse <i>Trompart</i> her did vew,<br>
He was dismayed in his coward mind,<br>
And doubted, whether he himselfe should shew,<br>
Or fly away, or bide alone behind:<br>
Both feare and hope he in her face did find,<br>
When she at last him spying thus bespake;<br>
Hayle Groome; didst not thou see a bleeding Hind,<br>
Whose right haunch earst my stedfast arrow strake?<br>
If thou didst, tell me, that I may her ouertake.<p>
 
Wherewith reviu'd, this answere forth he threw;<br>
O Goddesse, (for such I thee take to bee)<br>
For neither doth thy face terrestriall shew,<br>
Nor voyce sound mortall; I auow to thee,<br>
Such wounded beast, as that, I did not see,<br>
Sith earst into this forrest wild I came.<br>
But mote thy goodlyhed forgiue it mee,<br>
To weet, which of the Gods I shall thee name,<br>
That vnto thee due worship I may rightly frame.<p>
 
To whom she thus; but ere her words ensewed,<br>
Vnto the bush her eye did suddein glaunce,<br>
In which vaine <i>Braggadocchio</i> was mewed,<br>
And saw it stirre: she left her percing launce,<br>
And towards gan a deadly shaft aduaunce,<br>
In mind to marke the beast. At which sad stowre,<br>
<i>Trompart</i> forth stept, to stay the mortall chaunce,<br>
Out crying, &ocirc; what euer heauenly powre,<br>
Or earthly wight thou be, withhold this deadly howre.<p>
 
O stay thy hand, for yonder is no game<br>
For thy fierce arrowes, them to exercize,<br>
But loe my Lord, my liege, whose warlike name,<br>
Is farre renowmd through many bold emprize;<br>
And now in shade he shrowded yonder lies.<br>
She staid: with that he crauld out of his nest,<br>
Forth creeping on his caitiue hands and thies,<br>
And standing stoutly vp, his loftie crest<br>
Did fiercely shake, and rowze, as comming late from rest.<p>
 
As fearefull fowle, that long in secret caue<br>
For dread of soaring hauke her selfe hath hid,<br>
Not caring how, her silly life to saue,<br>
She her gay painted plumes disorderid,<br>
Seeing at last her selfe from daunger rid,<br>
Peepes foorth, and soone renewes her natiue pride;<br>
She gins her feathers foule disfigured<br>
Proudly to prune, and set on euery side,<br>
So shakes off shame, ne thinks how erst she did her hide.<p>
 
So when her goodly visage he beheld,<br>
He gan himselfe to vaunt: but when he vewed<br>
Those deadly tooles, which in her hand she held,<br>
Soone into other fits he was transmewed,<br>
Till she to him her gratious speach renewed;<br>
All haile, Sir knight, and well may thee befall,<br>
As all the like, which honour haue pursewed<br>
Through deedes of armes and prowesse martiall;<br>
All vertue merits praise, but such the most of all<p>
 
To whom he thus:  &ocirc; fairest vnder skie,<br>
True be thy words, and worthy of thy praise,<br>
That warlike feats doest highest glorifie.<br>
Therein haue I spent all my youthly daies,<br>
And many battailes fought, and many fraies<br>
Throughout the world, wher so they might be found,<br>
Endeuouring my dreadded name to raise<br>
Aboue the Moone, that fame may it resound<br>
In her eternall trompe, with laurell girland cround.<p>
 
But what art thou, &ocirc; Ladie, which doest raunge<br>
In this wilde forrest, where no pleasure is,<br>
And doest not it for ioyous court exchaunge,<br>
Emongst thine equall peres, where happie blis<br>
And all delight does raigne, much more then this?<br>
There thou maist loue, and dearely loued bee,<br>
And swim in pleasure, which thou here doest mis;<br>
There maist thou best be seene, and best maist see:<br>
The wood is fit for beasts, the court is fit for thee.<p>
 
Who so in pompe of proud estate (quoth she)<br>
Does swim, and bathes himselfe in courtly blis,<br>
Does waste his dayes in darke obscuritee,<br>
And in obliuion euer buried is:<br>
Where ease abounds, yt's eath to doe amis;<br>
But who his limbs with labours, and his mind<br>
Behaues with cares, cannot so easie mis.<br>
Abroad in armes, at home in studious kind<br>
Who seekes with painfull toile, shall honour soonest find.<p>
 
In woods, in waues, in warres she wonts to dwell,<br>
And will be found with perill and with paine;<br>
Ne can the man, that moulds in idle cell,<br>
Vnto her happie mansion attaine:<br>
Before her gate high God did Sweat ordaine,<br>
And wakefull watches euer to abide:<br>
But easie is the way, and passage plaine<br>
To pleasures pallace; it may soone be spide,<br>
And day and night her dores to all stand open wide.<p>
 
In Princes court,---The rest she would haue said,<br>
But that the foolish man, fild with delight<br>
Of her sweet words, that all his sence dismaid,<br>
And with her wondrous beautie rauisht quight,<br>
Gan burne in filthy lust, and leaping light,<br>
Thought in his bastard armes her to embrace.<br>
With that she swaruing backe, her Iauelin bright<br>
Against him bent, and fiercely did menace:<br>
So turned her about, and fled away apace.<p>
 
Which when the Peasant saw, amazd he stood,<br>
And grieued at her flight; yet durst he not<br>
Pursew her steps, through wild vnknowen wood;<br>
Besides he feard her wrath, and threatned shot<br>
Whiles in the bush he lay, not yet forgot:<br>
Ne car'd he greatly for her presence vaine,<br>
But turning said to <i>Trompart</i>, What foule blot<br>
Is this to knight, that Ladie should againe<br>
Depart to woods vntoucht, &amp; leaue so proud disdaine?<p>
 
Perdie (said <i>Trompart</i>) let her passe at will,<br>
Least by her presence daunger mote befall.<br>
For who can tell (and sure I feare it ill)<br>
But that she is some powre celestiall?<br>
For whiles she spake, her great words did apall<br>
My feeble courage, and my hart oppresse,<br>
That yet I quake and tremble ouer all.<br>
And I (said <i>Braggadocchio</i>) thought no lesse,<br>
When first I heard her horne sound with such ghastlinesse.<p>
 
For from my mothers wombe this grace I haue<br>
Me giuen by eternall destinie,<br>
That earthly thing may not my courage braue<br>
Dismay with feare, or cause one foot to flie,<br>
But either hellish feends, or powres on hie:<br>
Which was the cause, when earst that horne I heard,<br>
Weening it had beene thunder in the skie,<br>
I hid my selfe from it, as one affeard;<br>
But when I other knew, my selfe I boldly reard.<p>
 
But now for feare of worse, that may betide,<br>
Let vs soone hence depart.  They soone agree;<br>
So to his steed he got, and gan to ride,<br>
As one vnfit therefore, that all might see<br>
He had not trayned bene in cheualree.<br>
Which well that valiant courser did discerne;<br>
For he despysd to tread in dew degree,<br>
But chaufd and fom'd, with courage fierce and sterne,<br>
And to be easd of that base burden still did erne.<p>
