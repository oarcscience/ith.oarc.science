*Cant. V.*

> *The saluage serues Matilda well  
> till she Prince Arthure fynd,  
> Who her together with his Squyre  
> with th'Hermit leaues behynd.*

> O What an easie thing is to descry  
> The gentle bloud, how euer it be wrapt  
> In sad misfortunes foule deformity,  
> And wretched sorrowes, which haue often hapt?  
> For howsoeuer it may grow mis-shapt,  
> Like this wyld man, being vndisciplynd,  
> That to all vertue it may seeme vnapt,  
> Yet will it shew some sparkes of gentle mynd,  
> And at the last breake forth in his owne proper kynd.
>
> That plainely may in this wyld man be red,  
> Who though he were still in this desert wood,  
> Mongst saluage beasts, both rudely borne and bred,  
> Ne euer saw faire guize, ne learned good,  
> Yet shewd some token of his gentle blood,  
> By gentle vsage of that wretched Dame.  
> For certes he was borne of noble blood,  
> How euer by hard hap he hether came;  
> As ye may know, when time shall be to tell the same.
>
> Who when as now long time he lacked had  
> The good Sir *Calepine*, that farre was strayd,  
> Did wexe exceeding sorrowfull and sad,  
> As he of some misfortune were afrayd:  
> And leauing there this Ladie all dismayd,  
> Went forth streightway into the forrest wyde,  
> To seeke, if he perchance a sleepe were layd,  
> Or what so else were vnto him betyde:  
> He sought him farre and neare, yet him no where he spyde.
>
> Tho backe returning to that sorie Dame,  
> He shewed semblant of exceeding mone,  
> By speaking signes, as he them best could frame;  
> Now wringing both his wretched hands in one,  
> Now beating his hard head vpon a stone,  
> That ruth it was to see him so lament.  
> By which she well perceiuing, what was done,  
> Gan teare her hayre, and all her garments rent,  
> And beat her breast, and piteously her selfe torment.
>
> Vpon the ground her selfe she fiercely threw,  
> Regardlesse of her wounds, yet bleeding rife,  
> That with their bloud did all the flore imbrew,  
> As if her breast new launcht with murdrous knife,  
> Would streight dislodge the wretched wearie life.  
> There she long groueling, and deepe groning lay,  
> As if her vitall powers were at strife  
> With stronger death, and feared their decay,  
> Such were this Ladies pangs and dolorous assay.
>
> Whom when the Saluage saw so sore distrest,  
> He reared her vp from the bloudie ground,  
> And sought by all the meanes, that he could best,  
> Her to recure out of that stony swound,  
> And staunch the bleeding of her dreary wound.  
> Yet nould she be recomforted for nought,  
> Ne cease her sorrow and impatient stound,  
> But day and night did vexe her carefull thought,  
> And euer more and more her owne affliction wrought.
>
> At length, when as no hope of his retourne  
> She saw now left, she cast to leaue the place,  
> And wend abrode, though feeble and forlorne,  
> To seeke some comfort in that sorie case.  
> His steede now strong through rest so long a space,  
> Well as she could, she got, and did bedight,  
> And being thereon mounted, forth did pace,  
> Withouten guide, her to conduct aright,  
> Or gard her to defend from bold oppressors might.
>
> Whom when her Host saw readie to depart,  
> He would not suffer her alone to fare,  
> But gan himselfe addresse to take her part.  
> Those warlike armes, which *Calepine* whyleare  
> Had left behind, he gan eftsoones prepare,  
> And put them all about himselfe vnfit,  
> His shield, his helmet, and his curats bare.  
> But without sword vpon his thigh to sit:  
> Sir *Calepine* himselfe away had hidden it.
>
> So forth they traueld an vneuen payre,  
> That mote to all men seeme an vncouth sight;  
> A saluage man matcht with a Ladie fayre,  
> That rather seem'd the conquest of his might,  
> Gotten by spoyle, then purchaced aright.  
> But he did her attend most carefully,  
> And faithfully did serue both day and night,  
> Withouten thought of shame or villeny,  
> Ne euer shewed signe of foule disloyalty.
>
> Vpon a day as on their way they went,  
> It chaunst some furniture about her steed  
> To be disordred by some accident:  
> Which to redresse, she did th'assistance need  
> Of this her groome, which he by signes did reede;  
> And streight his combrous armes aside did lay  
> Vpon the ground, withouten doubt or dreed,  
> And in his homely wize began to assay  
> T'amend what was amisse, and put in right aray.
>
> Bout which whilest he was busied thus hard,  
> Lo where a knight together with his squire,  
> All arm'd to point came ryding thetherward,  
> Which seemed by their portance and attire,  
> To be two errant knights, that did inquire  
> After aduentures, where they mote them get.  
> Those were to weet (if that ye it require)  
> Prince *Arthur* and young *Timias*, which met  
> By straunge occasion, that here needs forth be set.
>
> After that *Timias* had againe recured  
> The fauour of *Belphebe*, (as ye heard)  
> And of her grace did stand againe assured,  
> To happie blisse he was full high vprear'd,  
> Nether of enuy, nor of chaunge afeard,  
> Though many foes did him maligne therefore,  
> And with vniust detraction him did beard;  
> Yet he himselfe so well and wisely bore,  
> That in her soueraine lyking he dwelt euermore.
>
> But of them all, which did his ruine seeke  
> Three mightie en'mies did him most despight,  
> Three mightie ones, and cruell minded eeke,  
> That him not onely sought by open might  
> To ouerthrow, but to supplant by slight.  
> The first of them by name was cald *Despetto*,  
> Exceeding all the rest in powre and hight;  
> The second not so strong but wise, *Decetto*;  
> The third nor strong nor wise, but spightfullest *Defetto*.
>
> Oftimes their sundry powres they did employ,  
> And seuerall deceipts, but all in vaine:  
> For neither they by force could him destroy,  
> Ne yet entrap in treasons subtill traine.  
> Therefore conspiring all together plaine,  
> They did their counsels now in one compound;  
> Where singled forces faile, conioynd may gaine.  
> The *Blatant Beast* the fittest meanes they found,  
> To worke his vtter shame, and throughly him confound.
>
> Vpon a day as they the time did waite,  
> When he did raunge the wood for saluage game,  
> They sent that *Blatant Beast* to be a baite,  
> To draw him from his deare beloued dame,  
> Vnwares into the daunger of defame.  
> For well they wist, that Squire to be so bold,  
> That no one beast in forrest wylde or tame,  
> Met him in chase, but he it challenge would,  
> And plucke the pray oftimes out of their greedy hould.
>
> The hardy boy, as they deuised had,  
> Seeing the vgly Monster passing by,  
> Vpon him set, of perill nought adrad,  
> Ne skilfull of the vncouth ieopardy;  
> And charged him so fierce and furiously,  
> That his great force vnable to endure,  
> He forced was to turne from him and fly:  
> Yet ere he fled, he with his tooth impure  
> Him heedlesse bit, the whiles he was thereof secure.
>
> Securely he did after him pursew,  
> Thinking by speed to ouertake his flight;  
> Who through thicke woods and brakes & briers him drew,  
> To weary him the more, and waste his spight,  
> So that he now has almost spent his spright.  
> Till that at length vnto a woody glade  
> He came, whose couert stopt his further sight,  
> There his three foes shrowded in guilefull shade,  
> Out of their ambush broke, and gan him to inuade.
>
> Sharpely they all attonce did him assaile,  
> Burning with inward rancour and despight,  
> And heaped strokes did round about him haile  
> With so huge force, that seemed nothing might  
> Beare off their blowes, from percing thorough quite.  
> Yet he them all so warily did ward,  
> That none of them in his soft flesh did bite,  
> And all the while his backe for best safegard,  
> He lent against a tree, that backeward onset bard.
>
> Like a wylde Bull, that being at a bay,  
> Is bayted of a mastiffe, and a hound,  
> And a curre-dog; that doe him sharpe assay  
> On euery side, and beat about him round;  
> But most that curre barking with bitter sownd,  
> And creeping still behinde, doth him incomber,  
> That in his chauffe he digs the trampled ground,  
> And threats his horns, and bellowes like the thonder,  
> So did that Squire his foes disperse, and driue asonder.
>
> Him well behoued so; for his three foes  
> Sought to encompasse him on euery side,  
> And dangerously did round about enclose.  
> But most of all *Defetto* him annoyde,  
> Creeping behinde him still to haue destroyde:  
> So did *Decetto* eke him circumuent,  
> But stout *Despetto* in his greater pryde,  
> Did front him face to face against him bent,  
> Yet he them all withstood, and often made relent.
>
> Till that at length nigh tyrd with former chace,  
> And weary now with carefull keeping ward,  
> He gan to shrinke, and somewhat to giue place,  
> Full like ere long to haue escaped hard;  
> When as vnwares he in the forrest heard  
> A trampling steede, that with his neighing fast  
> Did warne his rider be vppon his gard;  
> With noise whereof the Squire now nigh aghast,  
> Reuiued was, and sad dispaire away did cast.
>
> Eftsoones he spide a Knight approching nye,  
> Who seeing one in so great daunger set  
> Mongst many foes, him selfe did faster hye;  
> To reskue him, and his weake part abet,  
> For pitty so to see him ouerset.  
> Whom soone as his three enemies did vew,  
> They fled, and fast into the wood did get:  
> Him booted not to thinke them to pursew,  
> The couert was so thicke, that did no passage shew.
>
> Then turning to that swaine, him well he knew  
> To be his *Timias*, his owne true Squire,  
> Whereof exceeding glad, he to him drew,  
> And him embracing twixt his armes entire,  
> Him thus bespake; My liefe, my lifes desire,  
> Why haue ye me alone thus long yleft?  
> Tell me what worlds despight, or heauens yre  
> Hath you thus long away from me bereft?  
> Where haue ye all this while bin wandring, where bene weft?
>
> With that he sighed deepe for inward tyne:  
> To whom the Squire nought aunswered againe,  
> But shedding few soft teares from tender eyne,  
> His deare affect with silence did restraine,  
> And shut vp all his plaint in priuy paine.  
> There they awhile some gracious speaches spent,  
> As to them seemed fit time to entertaine.  
> After all which vp to their steedes they went,  
> And forth together rode a comely couplement.
>
> So now they be arriued both in sight  
> Of this wyld man, whom they full busie found  
> About the sad *Serena* things to dight,  
> With those braue armours lying on the ground,  
> That seem'd the spoile of some right well renownd.  
> Which when that Squire beheld, he to them stept,  
> Thinking to take them from that hylding hound:  
> But he it seeing, lightly to him lept,  
> And sternely with strong hand it from his handling kept.
>
> Gnashing his grinded teeth with griesly looke,  
> And sparkling fire out of his furious eyne,  
> Him with his fist vnwares on th'head he strooke,  
> That made him downe vnto the earth encline;  
> Whence soone vpstarting much he gan repine,  
> And laying hand vpon his wrathfull blade,  
> Thought therewithall forthwith him to haue slaine,  
> Who it perceiuing, hand vpon him layd,  
> And greedily him griping, his auengement stayd.
>
> With that aloude the faire *Serena* cryde  
> Vnto the Knight, them to dispart in twaine:  
> Who to them stepping did them soone diuide,  
> And did from further violence restraine,  
> Albe the wyld-man hardly would refraine.  
> Then gan the Prince, of her for to demand,  
> What and from whence she was, and by what traine  
> She fell into that saluage villaines hand,  
> And whether free with him she now were, or in band.
>
> To whom she thus; I am, as now ye see,  
> The wretchedst Dame, that liue this day on ground;  
> Who both in minde, the which most grieueth me,  
> And body haue receiu'd a mortall wound,  
> That hath me driuen to this drery stound.  
> I was erewhile, the loue of *Calepine*:  
> Who whether he aliue be to be found,  
> Or by some deadly chaunce be done to pine,  
> Since I him lately lost, vneath is to define.
>
> In saluage forrest I him lost of late,  
> Where I had surely long ere this bene dead,  
> Or else remained in most wretched state,  
> Had not this wylde man in that wofull stead  
> Kept, and deliuered me from deadly dread.  
> In such a saluage wight, of brutish kynd,  
> Amongst wilde beastes in desert forrests bred,  
> It is most straunge and wonderfull to fynd  
> So milde humanity, and perfect gentle mynd.
>
> Let me therefore this fauour for him finde,  
> That ye will not your wrath vpon him wreake,  
> Sith he cannot expresse his simple minde,  
> Ne yours conceiue, ne but by tokens speake:  
> Small praise to proue your powre on wight so weake.  
> With such faire words she did their heate asswage,  
> And the strong course of their displeasure breake,  
> That they to pitty turnd their former rage,  
> And each sought to supply the office of her page.
>
> So hauing all things well about her dight,  
> She on her way cast forward to proceede,  
> And they her forth conducted, where they might  
> Finde harbour fit to comfort her great neede.  
> For now her wounds corruption gan to breed;  
> And eke this Squire, who likewise wounded was  
> Of that same Monster late, for lacke of heed,  
> Now gan to faint, and further could not pas  
> Through feeblenesse, which all his limbes oppressed has.
>
> So forth they rode together all in troupe,  
> To seeke some place, the which mote yeeld some ease  
> To these sicke twaine, that now began to droupe,  
> And all the way the Prince sought to appease  
> The bitter anguish of their sharpe disease,  
> By all the courteous meanes he could inuent;  
> Somewhile with merry purpose fit to please,  
> And otherwhile with good encouragement,  
> To make them to endure the pains, did them torment.
>
> Mongst which, *Serena* did to him relate  
> The foule discourt'sies and vnknightly parts,  
> Which *Turpine* had vnto her shewed late,  
> Without compassion of her cruell smarts:  
> Although *Blandina* did with all her arts  
> Him otherwise perswade, all that she might;  
> Yet he of malice, without her desarts,  
> Not onely her excluded late at night,  
> But also trayterously did wound her weary Knight.
>
> Wherewith the Prince sore moued, there auoud,  
> That soone as he returned backe againe,  
> He would auenge th'abuses of that proud  
> And shamefull Knight, of whom she did complaine.  
> This wize did they each other entertaine,  
> To passe the tedious trauell of the way;  
> Till towards night they came vnto a plaine,  
> By which a little Hermitage there lay,  
> Far from all neighbourhood, the which annoy it may.
>
> And nigh thereto a little Chappell stoode,  
> Which being all with Yuy ouerspred,  
> Deckt all the roofe, and shadowing the roode,  
> Seem'd like a groue faire braunched ouer hed:  
> Therein the Hermite, which his life here led  
> In streight obseruaunce of religious vow,  
> Was wont his howres and holy things to bed;  
> And therein he likewise was praying now,  
> Whenas these Knights arriu'd, they wist not where nor how.
>
> They stayd not there, but streight way in did pas.  
> Whom when the Hermite present saw in place,  
> From his deuotion streight he troubled was;  
> Which breaking of he toward them did pace,  
> With stayed steps, and graue beseeming grace:  
> For well it seem'd, that whilome he had beene  
> Some goodly person, and of gentle race,  
> That could his good to all, and well did weene,  
> How each to entertaine with curt'sie well beseene,
>
> And soothly it was sayd by common fame,  
> So long as age enabled him thereto,  
> That he had bene a man of mickle name,  
> Renowmed much in armes and derring doe:  
> But being aged now and weary to  
> Of warres delight, and worlds contentious toyle,  
> The name of knighthood he did disauow,  
> And hanging vp his armes and warlike spoyle,  
> From all this worlds incombraunce did himselfe assoyle.
>
> He thence them led into his Hermitage,  
> Letting their steedes to graze vpon the Green:  
> Small was his house, and like a little cage,  
> For his owne turne, yet inly neate and clene,  
> Deckt with greene boughes, and flowers gay beseene.  
> Therein he them full faire did entertaine  
> Not with such forged showes, as fitter beene  
> For courting fooles, that curtesies would faine,  
> But with entire affection and appearaunce plaine.
>
> Yet was their fare but homely, such as hee  
> Did vse, his feeble body to sustaine;  
> The which full gladly they did take in glee,  
> Such as it was, ne did of want complaine,  
> But being well suffiz'd, them rested faine.  
> But faire *Serene* all night could take no rest,  
> Ne yet that gentle Squire, for grieuous paine  
> Of their late woundes, the which the *Blatant Beast*  
> Had giuen them, whose griefe through suffraunce sore increast.
>
> So all that night they past in great disease,  
> Till that the morning, bringing earely light  
> To guide mens labours, brought them also ease,  
> And some asswagement of their painefull plight.  
> Then vp they rose, and gan them selues to dight  
> Vnto their iourney; but that Squire and Dame  
> So faint and feeble were, that they ne might  
> Endure to trauell, nor one foote to frame:  
> Their hearts were sicke, their sides were sore, their feete were lame.
>
> Therefore the Prince, whom great affaires in mynd  
> Would not permit, to make their lenger stay,  
> Was forced there to leaue them both behynd,  
> In that good Hermits charge, whom he did pray  
> To tend them well. So forth he went his way,  
> And with him eke the saluage, that whyleare  
> Seeing his royall vsage and array,  
> Was greatly growne in loue of that braue pere,  
> Would needes depart, as shall declared be elsewhere.
