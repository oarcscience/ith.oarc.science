<blockquote>
<i>Prince Arthur takes the enterprize<br>
for Belgee for to fight:<br>
Gerioneos Seneschall<br>
he slayes in Belges right.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
S
Ome Clarkes doe doubt in their deuicefull art,<br>
Whether this heauenly thing, whereof I treat,<br>
To weeten <i>Mercie</i>, be of Iustice part,<br>
Or drawne forth from her by diuine extreate.<br>
This well I wote, that sure she is as great,<br>
And meriteth to haue as high a place,<br>
Sith in th'Almighties euerlasting seat<br>
She first was bred, and borne of heauenly race;<br>
From thence pour'd down on men, by influence of grace.<p>

For if that Vertue be of so great might,<br>
Which from iust verdict will for nothing start,<br>
But to preserue inuiolated right,<br>
Oft spilles the principall, to saue the part;<br>
So much more then is that of powre and art,<br>
That seekes to saue the subiect of her skill,<br>
Yet neuer doth from doome of right depart:<br>
As it is greater prayse to saue, then spill,<br>
And better to reforme, then to cut off the ill.<p>

Who then can thee, <i>Mercilla</i>, throughly prayse,<br>
That herein doest all earthly Princes pas?<br>
What heauenly Muse shall thy great honour rayse<br>
Vp to the skies, whence first deriu'd it was,<br>
And now on earth it selfe enlarged has,<br>
From th'vtmost brinke of the <i>Armericke</i> shore,<br>
Vnto the margent of the <i>Molucas</i>?<br>
Those Nations farre thy iustice doe adore:<br>
But thine owne people do thy mercy prayse much more.<p>

Much more it praysed was of those two knights;<br>
The noble Prince, and righteous <i>Artegall</i>,<br>
When they had seene and heard her doome a rights<br>
Against <i>Duessa</i>, damned by them all;<br>
But by her tempred without griefe or gall,<br>
Till strong constraint did her thereto enforce.<br>
And yet euen then ruing her wilfull fall,<br>
With more then needfull naturall remorse,<br>
And yeelding the last honour to her wretched corse.<p>

During all which, those knights continu'd there,<br>
Both doing and receiuing curtesies,<br>
Of that great Ladie, who with goodly chere<br>
Them entertayn'd, fit for their dignities,<br>
Approuing dayly to their noble eyes<br>
Royall examples of her mercies rare,<br>
And worthie paterns of her clemencies;<br>
Which till this day mongst many liuing are,<br>
Who them to their posterities doe still declare.<p>

Amongst the rest, which in that space befell,<br>
There came two Springals of full tender yeares,<br>
Farre thence from forrein land, where they did dwell,<br>
To seeke for succour of her and of her Peares<br>
With humble prayers and intreatfull teares;<br>
Sent by their mother, who a widow was,<br>
Wrapt in great dolours and in deadly feares,<br>
By a strong Tyrant, who inuaded has<br>
Her land, and slaine her children ruefully alas.<p>

Her name was <i>Belg&aelig;</i>, who in former age<br>
A Ladie of great worth and wealth had beene,<br>
And mother of a frutefull heritage,<br>
Euen seuenteene goodly sonnes; which who had seene<br>
In their first flowre, before this fatall teene<br>
Them ouertooke, and their faire blossomes blasted,<br>
More happie mother would her surely weene,<br>
Then famous <i>Niobe</i>, before she tasted<br>
<i>Latonaes</i> childrens wrath, that all her issue wasted.<p>

But this fell Tyrant, through his tortious powre,<br>
Had left her now but fiue of all that brood:<br>
For twelue of them he did by times deuoure,<br>
And to his Idols sacrifice their blood,<br>
Whylest he of none was stopped, nor withstood.<br>
For soothly he was one of matchlesse might,<br>
Of horrible aspect, and dreadfull mood,<br>
And had three bodies in one wast empight,<br>
And th'armes and legs of three, to succour him in fight.<p>

And sooth they say, that he was borne and bred<br>
Of Gyants race, the sonne of <i>Geryon</i>,<br>
He that whylome in Spaine so sore was dred,<br>
For his huge powre and great oppression,<br>
Which brought that land to his subiection,<br>
Through his three bodies powre, in one combynd;<br>
And eke all strangers in that region<br>
Arryuing, to his kyne for food assynd;<br>
The fayrest kyne aliue, but of the fiercest kynd.<p>

For they were all, they say, of purple hew,<br>
Kept by a cowheard, hight <i>Eurytion</i>,<br>
A cruell carle, the which all strangers slew,<br>
Ne day nor night did sleepe, t'attend them on,<br>
But walkt about them euer and anone,<br>
With his two headed dogge, that <i>Orthrus</i> hight;<br>
<i>Orthrus</i> begotten by great <i>Typhaon</i>,<br>
And foule <i>Echidna</i>, in the house of night;<br>
But <i>Hercules</i> them all did ouercome in fight.<p>

His sonne was this, <i>Geryoneo</i> hight,<br>
Who after that his monstrous father fell<br>
Vnder <i>Alcides</i> club, streight tooke his flight<br>
From that sad land, where he his syre did quell,<br>
And came to this, where <i>Belge</i> then did dwell,<br>
And flourish in all wealth and happinesse,<br>
Being then new made widow (as befell)<br>
After her Noble husbands late decesse;<br>
Which gaue beginning to her woe and wretchednesse.<p>

Then this bold Tyrant, of her widowhed<br>
Taking aduantage, and her yet fresh woes,<br>
Himselfe and seruice to her offered,<br>
Her to defend against all forrein foes,<br>
That should their powre against her right oppose.<br>
Whereof she glad, now needing strong defence,<br>
Him entertayn'd, and did her champion chose:<br>
Which long he vsd with carefull diligence,<br>
The better to confirme her fearelesse confidence.<p>

By meanes whereof, she did at last commit<br>
All to his hands, and gaue him soueraine powre<br>
To doe, what euer he thought good or fit.<br>
Which hauing got, he gan forth from that howre<br>
To stirre vp strife, and many a Tragicke stowre,<br>
Giuing her dearest children one by one<br>
Vnto a dreadfull Monster to deuoure,<br>
And setting vp an Idole of his owne,<br>
The image of his monstrous parent <i>Geryone</i>.<p>

So tyrannizing, and oppressing all,<br>
The woefull widow had no meanes now left,<br>
But vnto gratious great <i>Mercilla</i> call<br>
For ayde, against that cruell Tyrants theft,<br>
Ere all her children he from her had reft.<br>
Therefore these two, her eldest sonnes she sent,<br>
To seeke for succour of this Ladies gieft:<br>
To whom their sute they humbly did present,<br>
In th'hearing of full many Knights and Ladies gent.<p>

Amongst the which then fortuned to bee<br>
The noble Briton Prince, with his braue Peare;<br>
Who when he none of all those knights did see<br>
Hastily bent, that enterprise to heare,<br>
Nor vndertake the same, for cowheard feare,<br>
He stepped forth with courage bold and great,<br>
Admyr'd of all the rest in presence there,<br>
And humbly gan that mightie Queene entreat,<br>
To graunt him that aduenture for his former feat.<p>

She gladly graunted it: then he straight way<br>
Himselfe vnto his iourney gan prepare,<br>
And all his armours readie dight that day,<br>
That nought the morrow next mote stay his fare.<br>
The morrow next appear'd, with purple hayre<br>
Yet dropping fresh out of the <i>Indian</i> fount,<br>
And bringing light into the heauens fayre,<br>
When he was readie to his steede to mount<br>
Vnto his way, which now was all his care and count.<p>

Then taking humble leaue of that great Queene,<br>
Who gaue him roiall giftes and riches rare,<br>
As tokens of her thankefull mind beseene,<br>
And leauing <i>Artegall</i> to his owne care;<br>
Vpon his voyage forth he gan to fare,<br>
With those two gentle youthes, which him did guide,<br>
And all his way before him still prepare.<br>
Ne after him did <i>Artegall</i> abide,<br>
But on his first aduenture forward forth did ride.<p>

It was not long, till that the Prince arriued<br>
Within the land, where dwelt that Ladie sad,<br>
Whereof that Tyrant had her now depriued,<br>
And into moores and marshes banisht had,<br>
Out of the pleasant soyle, and citties glad,<br>
In which she wont to harbour happily:<br>
But now his cruelty so sore she drad,<br>
That to those fennes for fastnesse she did fly,<br>
And there her selfe did hyde from his hard tyranny.<p>

There he her found in sorrow and dismay,<br>
All solitarie without liuing wight;<br>
For all her other children, through affray,<br>
Had hid themselues, or taken further flight:<br>
And eke her selfe through sudden strange affright,<br>
When one in armes she saw, began to fly;<br>
But when her owne two sonnes she had in sight,<br>
She gan take hart, and looke vp ioyfully:<br>
For well she wist this knight came, succour to supply.<p>

And running vnto them with greedy ioyes,<br>
Fell straight about their neckes, as they did kneele,<br>
And bursting forth in teares; Ah my sweet boyes,<br>
(Sayd she) yet now I gin new life to feele,<br>
And feeble spirits, that gan faint and reele,<br>
Now rise againe, at this your ioyous sight.<br>
Alreadie seemes that fortunes headlong wheele<br>
Begins to turne, and sunne to shine more bright,<br>
Then it was wont, through comfort of this noble knight.<p>

Then turning vnto him; And you Sir knight<br>
(Said she) that taken haue this toylesome paine<br>
For wretched woman, miserable wight,<br>
May you in heauen immortall guerdon gaine<br>
For so great trauell, as you doe sustaine:<br>
For other meede may hope for none of mee,<br>
To whom nought else, but bare life doth remaine,<br>
And that so wretched one, as ye do see<br>
Is liker lingring death, then loathed life to bee.<p>

Much was he moued with her piteous plight,<br>
And low dismounting from his loftie steede,<br>
Gan to recomfort her all that he might,<br>
Seeking to driue away deepe rooted dreede,<br>
With hope of helpe in that her greatest neede.<br>
So thence he wished her with him to wend,<br>
Vnto some place, where they mote rest and feede,<br>
And she take comfort, which God now did send:<br>
Good hart in euils doth the euils much amend.<p>

Ay me (sayd she) and whether shall I goe?<br>
Are not all places full of forraine powres?<br>
My pallaces possessed of my foe,<br>
My cities sackt, and their sky-threating towres<br>
Raced, and made smooth fields now full of flowres?<br>
Onely these marishes, and myrie bogs,<br>
In which the fearefull ewftes do build their bowres,<br>
Yeeld me an hostry mongst the croking frogs,<br>
And harbour here in safety from those rauenous dogs.<p>

Nathlesse (said he) deare Ladie with me goe,<br>
Some place shall vs receiue, and harbour yield;<br>
If not, we will it force, maugre your foe,<br>
And purchase it to vs with speare and shield:<br>
And if all fayle, yet farewell open field:<br>
The earth to all her creatures lodging lends.<br>
With such his chearefull speaches he doth wield<br>
Her mind so well, that to his will she bends<br>
And bynding vp her locks and weeds, forth with him wends.<p>

They came vnto a Citie farre vp land,<br>
The which whylome that Ladies owne had bene;<br>
But now by force extort out of her hand,<br>
By her strong foe, who had defaced cleene<br>
Her stately towres, and buildings sunny sheene;<br>
Shut vp her hauen, mard her marchants trade,<br>
Robbed her people, that full rich had beene,<br>
And in her necke a Castle huge had made,<br>
The which did her c&otilde;maund, without needing perswade.<p>

That Castle was the strength of all that state,<br>
Vntill that state by strength was pulled downe,<br>
And that same citie, so now ruinate,<br>
Had bene the keye of all that kingdomes crowne;<br>
Both goodly Castle, and both goodly Towne,<br>
Till that th'offended heauens list to lowre<br>
Vpon their blisse, and balefull fortune frowne.<br>
When those gainst states and kingdomes do coniure,<br>
Who then can thinke their hedlong ruine to recure.<p>

But he had brought it now in seruile bond,<br>
And made it beare the yoke of inquisition,<br>
Stryuing long time in vaine it to withstond;<br>
Yet glad at last to make most base submission,<br>
And life enioy for any composition.<br>
So now he hath new lawes and orders new<br>
Imposd on it, with many a hard condition,<br>
And forced it, the honour that is dew<br>
To God, to doe vnto his Idole most vntrew.<p>

To him he hath, before this Castle greene,<br>
Built a faire Chappell, and an Altar framed<br>
Of costly Iuory, full rich beseene,<br>
On which that cursed Idole farre proclamed,<br>
He hath set vp, and him his God hath named;<br>
Offring to him in sinfull sacrifice<br>
The flesh of men, to Gods owne likenesse framed,<br>
And powring forth their bloud in brutishe wize,<br>
That any yron eyes to see it would agrize.<p>

And for more horror and more crueltie,<br>
Vnder that cursed Idols altar stone;<br>
An hideous monster doth in darknesse lie,<br>
Whose dreadfull shape was neuer seene of none<br>
That liues on earth; but vnto those alone<br>
The which vnto him sacrificed bee.<br>
Those he deuoures, they say, both flesh and bone:<br>
What else they haue, is all the Tyrants fee;<br>
So that no whit of them remayning one may see.<p>

There eke he placed a strong garrisone,<br>
And set a Seneschall of dreaded might,<br>
That by his powre oppressed euery one,<br>
And vanquished all ventrous knights in fight;<br>
To whom he wont shew all the shame he might,<br>
After that them in battell he had wonne.<br>
To which when now they gan approch in sight,<br>
The Ladie counseld him the place to shonne,<br>
Whereas so many knights had fouly bene fordonne.<p>

Her fearefull speaches nought he did regard,<br>
But ryding streight vnder the Castle wall,<br>
Called aloud vnto the watchfull ward,<br>
Which there did wayte, willing them forth to call<br>
Into the field their Tyrants Seneschall.<br>
To whom when tydings thereof came, he streight<br>
Cals for his armes, and arming him withall,<br>
Eftsoones forth pricked proudly in his might,<br>
And gan with courage fierce addresse him to the fight.<p>

They both encounter in the middle plaine,<br>
And their sharpe speares doe both together smite<br>
Amid their shields, with so huge might and maine,<br>
That seem'd their soules they wold haue ryuen quight<br>
Out of their breasts, with furious despight.<br>
Yet could the Seneschals no entrance find<br>
Into the Princes shield, where it empight;<br>
So pure the mettall was, and well refynd,<br>
But shiuered all about, and scattered in the wynd.<p>

Not so the Princes, but with restlesse force,<br>
Into his shield it readie passage found,<br>
Both through his haberieon, and eke his corse:<br>
Which tombling downe vpon the senselesse ground,<br>
Gaue leaue vnto his ghost from thraldome bound,<br>
To wander in the griesly shades of night.<br>
There did the Prince him leaue in deadly swound,<br>
And thence vnto the castle marched right,<br>
To see if entrance there as yet obtaine he might.<p>

But as he nigher drew, three knights he spyde,<br>
All arm'd to point, issuing forth a pace,<br>
Which towards him with all their powre did ryde,<br>
And meeting him right in the middle race,<br>
Did all their speares attonce on him enchace.<br>
As three great Culuerings for battrie bent,<br>
And leueld all against one certaine place,<br>
Doe all attonce their thunders rage forth rent,<br>
That makes the wals to stagger with astonishment:<p>

So all attonce they on the Prince did thonder;<br>
Who from his saddle swarued nought asyde,<br>
Ne to their force gaue way, that was great wonder,<br>
But like a bulwarke, firmely did abyde;<br>
Rebutting him, which in the midst did ryde,<br>
With so huge rigour, that his mortall speare<br>
Past through his shield, &amp; pierst through either syde,<br>
That downe he fell vppon his mother deare,<br>
And powred forth his wretched life in deadly dreare.<p>

Whom when his other fellowes saw, they fled<br>
As fast as feete could carry them away;<br>
And after them the Prince as swiftly sped,<br>
To be aueng'd of their vnknightly play.<br>
There whilest they entring, th'one did th'other stay,<br>
The hindmost in the gate he ouerhent,<br>
And as he pressed in, him there did slay:<br>
His carkasse tumbling on the threshold, sent<br>
His groning soule vnto her place of punishment.<p>

The other which was entred, laboured fast<br>
To sperre the gate; but that same lumpe of clay,<br>
Whose grudging ghost was thereout fled and past,<br>
Right in the middest of the threshold lay,<br>
That it the Posterne did from closing stay:<br>
The whiles the Prince hard preased in betweene,<br>
And entraunce wonne. Streight th'other fled away,<br>
And ran into the Hall, where he did weene<br>
Him selfe to saue: but he there slew him at the skreene.<p>

Then all the rest which in that Castle were,<br>
Seeing that sad ensample them before,<br>
Durst not abide, but fled away for feare,<br>
And them conuayd out at a Posterne dore.<br>
Long sought the Prince, but when he found no more<br>
T'oppose against his powre, he forth issued<br>
Vnto that Lady, where he her had lore,<br>
And her gan cheare, with what she there had vewed,<br>
And what she had not seene, within vnto her shewed.<p>

Who with right humble thankes him goodly greeting,<br>
For so great prowesse, as he there had proued,<br>
Much greater then was euer in her weeting,<br>
With great admiraunce inwardly was moued,<br>
And honourd him, with all that her behoued.<br>
Thenceforth into that Castle he her led,<br>
With her two sonnes, right deare of her beloued,<br>
Where all that night them selues they cherished,<br>
And from her balefull minde all care he banished.<p>
