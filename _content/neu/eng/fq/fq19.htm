<blockquote> 
<i>Guyon is of immodest Merth,<br>
led into loose desire,<br>
Fights with Cymochles, whiles his bro-<br>
ther burnes in furious fire.</i><p>
</blockquote> 

 
<p>
<blockquote> 
A harder lesson, to learne Continence<br>
In ioyous pleasure, then in grieuous paine:<br>
or sweetnesse doth allure the weaker sence<br>
So strongly, that vneathes it can refraine<br>
From that, which feeble nature couets faine;<br>
But griefe and wrath, that be her enemies,<br>
And foes of life, she better can restraine;<br>
Yet vertue vauntes in both their victories,<br>
And <i>Guyon</i> in them all shewes goodly maisteries.<p>
 
Whom bold <i>Cymochles</i> trauelling to find,<br>
With cruell purpose bent to wreake on him<br>
The wrath, which <i>Atin</i> kindled in his mind,<br>
Came to a riuer, by whose vtmost brim<br>
Wayting to passe, he saw whereas did swim<br>
A long the shore, as swift as glaunce of eye,<br>
A litle Gondelay, bedecked trim<br>
With boughes and arbours wouen cunningly,<br>
That like a litle forrest seemed outwardly.<p>
 
And therein sate a Ladie fresh and faire,<br>
Making sweet solace to her selfe alone;<br>
Sometimes she sung, as loud as larke in aire,<br>
Sometimes she laught, that nigh her breth was gone,<br>
Yet was there not with her else any one,<br>
That might to her moue cause of meriment:<br>
Matter of merth enough, though there were none<br>
She could deuise, and thousand waies inuent,<br>
To feede her foolish humour, and vaine iolliment.<p>
 
Which when farre off <i>Cymochles</i> heard, and saw,<br>
He loudly cald to such, as were a bord,<br>
The little barke vnto the shore to draw,<br>
And him to ferrie ouer that deepe ford:<br>
The merry marriner vnto his word<br>
Soone hearkned, and her painted bote streightway<br>
Turnd to the shore, where that same warlike Lord<br>
She in receiu'd; but <i>Atin</i> by no way<br>
She would admit, albe the knight her much did pray.<p>
 
Eftsoones her shallow ship away did slide,<br>
More swift, then swallow sheres the liquid skie,<br>
Withouten oare or Pilot it to guide,<br>
Or winged canuas with the wind to flie,<br>
Only she turn'd a pin, and by and by<br>
It cut away vpon the yielding waue,<br>
Ne cared she her course for to apply:<br>
For it was taught the way, which she would haue,<br>
And both from rocks and flats it selfe could wisely saue.<p>
 
And all the way, the wanton Damzell found<br>
New merth, her passenger to entertaine:<br>
For she in pleasant purpose did abound,<br>
And greatly ioyed merry tales to faine,<br>
Of which a store-house did with her remaine,<br>
Yet seemed, nothing well they her became;<br>
For all her words she drownd with laughter vaine,<br>
And wanted grace in vtt'ring of the same,<br>
That turned all her pleasance to a scoffing game.<p>
 
And other whiles vaine toyes she would deuize<br>
As her fantasticke wit did most delight,<br>
Sometimes her head she fondly would aguize<br>
With gaudie girlonds, or fresh flowrets dight<br>
About her necke, or rings of rushes plight;<br>
Sometimes to doe him laugh, she would assay<br>
To laugh at shaking of the leaues light,<br>
Or to behold the water worke, and play<br>
About her litle frigot, therein making way.<p>
 
Her light behauiour, and loose dalliaunce<br>
Gaue wondrous great contentment to the knight,<br>
That of his way he had no souenaunce,<br>
Nor care of vow'd reuenge, and cruell fight,<br>
But to weake wench did yeeld his martiall might.<br>
So easie was to quench his flamed mind<br>
With one sweet drop of sensuall delight:<br>
So easie is, t'appease the stormie wind<br>
Of malice in the calme of pleasant womankind.<p>
 
Diuerse discourses in their way they spent,<br>
Mongst which <i>Cymochles</i> of her questioned,<br>
Both what she was, and what that vsage ment,<br>
Which in her cot she daily practised.<br>
Vaine man (said she) that wouldest be reckoned<br>
A straunger in thy home, and ignoraunt<br>
Of <i>Ph&aelig;dria</i> (for so my name is red)<br>
Of <i>Ph&aelig;dria</i>, thine owne fellow seruaunt;<br>
For thou to serue <i>Acrasia</i> thy selfe doest vaunt.<p>
 
In this wide Inland sea, that hight by name<br>
The <i>Idle lake</i>, my wandring ship I row,<br>
That knowes her port, and thither sailes by ayme,<br>
Ne care, ne feare I, how the wind do blow,<br>
Or whether swift I wend, or whether slow:<br>
Both slow and swift a like do serue my tourne,<br>
Ne swelling <i>Neptune</i>, ne loud thundring <i>Ioue</i><br>
Can chaunge my cheare, or make me euer mourne;<br>
My litle boat can safely passe this perilous bourne.<p>
 
Whiles thus she talked, and whiles thus she toyd,<br>
They were farre past the passage, which he spake,<br>
And come vnto an Island, waste and voyd,<br>
That floted in the midst of that great lake:<br>
There her small Gondelay her port did make,<br>
And that gay paire issuing on the shore<br>
Disburdned her.  Their way they forward take<br>
Into the land, that lay them faire before,<br>
Whose pleasaunce she him shew'd, and plentifull great store.<p>
 
It was a chosen plot of fertile land,<br>
Emongst wide waues set, like a litle nest,<br>
As if it had by Natures cunning hand,<br>
Bene choisely picked out from all the rest,<br>
And laid forth for ensample of the best:<br>
No daintie flowre or herbe, that growes on ground,<br>
No arboret with painted blossomes drest,<br>
And smelling sweet, but there it might be found<br>
To bud out faire, and her sweet smels throw all around.<p>
 
No tree, whose braunches did not brauely spring;<br>
No braunch, whereon a fine bird did not sit:<br>
No bird, but did her shrill notes sweetly sing;<br>
No song but did containe a louely dit:<br>
Trees, braunches, birds, and songs were framed fit,<br>
For to allure fraile mind to carelesse ease.<br>
Carelesse the man soone woxe, and his weake wit<br>
Was ouercome of thing, that did him please;<br>
So pleased, did his wrathfull purpose faire appease.<p>
 
Thus when she had his eyes and senses fed<br>
With false delights, and fild with pleasures vaine,<br>
Into a shadie dale she soft him led,<br>
And laid him downe vpon a grassie plaine;<br>
And her sweet selfe without dread, or disdaine,<br>
She set beside, laying his head disarm'd<br>
In her loose lap, it softly to sustaine,<br>
Where soone he slumbred, fearing not be harm'd,<br>
The whiles with a loue lay she thus him sweetly charm'd.<p>
 
Behold, &ocirc; man, that toilesome paines doest take<br>
The flowres, the fields, and all that pleasant growes,<br>
How they themselues doe thine ensample make,<br>
Whiles nothing enuious nature them forth throwes<br>
Out of her fruitfull lap; how, no man knowes,<br>
They spring, they bud, they blossome fresh and faire,<br>
And deck the world with their rich pompous showes;<br>
Yet no man for them taketh paines or care,<br>
Yet no man to them can his carefull paines compare.<p>
 
The lilly, Ladie of the flowring field,<br>
The Flowre-deluce, her louely Paramoure,<br>
Bid thee to them thy fruitlesse labours yield,<br>
And soone leaue off this toylesome wearie stoure;<br>
Loe loe how braue she decks her bounteous boure,<br>
With silken curtens and gold couerlets,<br>
Therein to shrowd her sumptuous Belamoure,<br>
Yet neither spinnes nor cardes, ne cares nor frets,<br>
But to her mother Nature all her care she lets.<p>
 
Why then dost thou, &ocirc; man, that of them all<br>
Art Lord, and eke of nature Soueraine,<br>
Wilfully make thy selfe a wretched thrall,<br>
And wast thy ioyous houres in needlesse paine,<br>
Seeking for daunger and aduentures vaine?<br>
What bootes it all to haue, and nothing vse?<br>
Who shall him rew, that swimming in the maine,<br>
Will die for thirst, and water doth refuse?<br>
Refuse such fruitlesse toile, and present pleasures chuse.<p>
 
By this she had him lulled fast a sleepe,<br>
That of no wordly thing he care did take;<br>
Then she with liquors strong his eyes did steepe,<br>
That nothing should him hastily awake:<br>
So she him left, and did her selfe betake<br>
Vnto her boat againe, with which she cleft<br>
The slouthfull waue of that great griesly lake;<br>
Soone she that Island farre behind her left,<br>
And now is come to that same place, where first she weft.<p>
 
By this time was the worthy <i>Guyon</i> brought<br>
Vnto the other side of that wide strond,<br>
Where she was rowing, and for passage sought:<br>
Him needed not long call, she soone to hond<br>
Her ferry brought, where him she byding fond,<br>
With his sad guide; himselfe she tooke a boord,<br>
But the <i>Blacke Palmer</i> suffred still to stond,<br>
Ne would for price, or prayers once affoord,<br>
To ferry that old man ouer the perlous foord.<p>
 
<i>Guyon</i> was loath to leaue his guide behind,<br>
Yet being entred, might not backe retyre;<br>
For the flit barke, obaying to her mind,<br>
Forth launched quickly, as she did desire,<br>
Ne gaue him leaue to bid that aged sire<br>
Adieu, but nimbly ran her wonted course<br>
Through the dull billowes thicke as troubled mire,<br>
Whom neither wind out of their seat could forse,<br>
Nor timely tides did driue out of their sluggish sourse.<p>
 
And by the way, as was her wonted guize,<br>
Her merry fit she freshly gan to reare,<br>
And did of ioy and iollitie deuize,<br>
Her selfe to cherish, and her guest to cheare:<br>
The knight was courteous, and did not forbeare<br>
Her honest merth and pleasaunce to partake;<br>
But when he saw her toy, and gibe, and geare,<br>
And passe the bonds of modest merimake,<br>
Her dalliance he despisd, and follies did forsake.<p>
 
Yet she still followed her former stile,<br>
And said, and did all that mote him delight,<br>
Till they arriued in that pleasant Ile,<br>
Where sleeping late she left her other knight.<br>
But when as <i>Guyon</i> of that land had sight,<br>
He wist himselfe amisse, and angry said;<br>
Ah Dame, perdie ye haue not doen me right,<br>
Thus to mislead me, whiles I you obaid:<br>
Me litle needed from my right way to haue straid.<p>
 
Faire Sir (quoth she) be not displeasd at all;<br>
Who fares on sea, may not commaund his way,<br>
Ne wind and weather at his pleasure call:<br>
The sea is wide, and easie for to stray;<br>
The wind vnstable, and doth neuer stay.<br>
But here a while ye may in safety rest,<br>
Till season serue new passage to assay;<br>
Better safe port, then be in seas distrest.<br>
Therewith she laught, and did her earnest end in iest.<p>
 
But he halfe discontent, mote nathelesse<br>
Himselfe appease, and issewd forth on shore:<br>
The ioyes whereof, and happie fruitfulnesse,<br>
Such as he saw, she gan him lay before,<br>
And all though pleasant, yet she made much more:<br>
The fields did laugh, the flowres did freshly spring,<br>
The trees did bud, and earely blossomes bore,<br>
And all the quire of birds did sweetly sing,<br>
And told that gardins pleasures in their caroling.<p>
 
And she more sweet, then any bird on bough,<br>
Would oftentimes emongst them beare a part,<br>
And striue to passe (as she could well enough)<br>
Their natiue musicke by her skilfull art:<br>
So did she all, that might his constant hart<br>
Withdraw from thought of warlike enterprize,<br>
And drowne in dissolute delights apart,<br>
Where noyse of armes, or vew of martiall guize<br>
Might not reuiue desire of knightly exercize.<p>
 
But he was wise, and warie of her will,<br>
And euer held his hand vpon his hart:<br>
Yet would not seeme so rude, and thewed ill,<br>
As to despise so courteous seeming part,<br>
That gentle Ladie did to him impart,<br>
But fairely tempring fond desire subdewd,<br>
And euer her desired to depart.<br>
She list not heare, but her disports poursewd,<br>
And euer bad him stay, till time the tide renewd.<p>
 
And now by this, <i>Cymochles</i> howre was spent,<br>
That he awoke out of his idle dreme,<br>
And shaking off his drowzie dreriment,<br>
Gan him auize, how ill did him beseeme,<br>
In slouthfull sleepe his molten hart to steme,<br>
And quench the brond of his conceiued ire.<br>
Tho vp he started, stird with shame extreme,<br>
Ne staied for his Damzell to inquire,<br>
But marched to the strond, their passage to require.<p>
 
And in the way he with Sir <i>Guyon</i> met,<br>
Accompanyde with <i>Ph&aelig;dria</i> the faire,<br>
Eftsoones he gan to rage, and inly fret,<br>
Crying, Let be that Ladie debonaire,<br>
Thou recreant knight, and soone thy selfe prepaire<br>
To battell, if thou meane her loue to gaine:<br>
Loe, loe alreadie, how the fowles in aire<br>
Doe flocke, awaiting shortly to obtaine<br>
Thy carcasse for their pray, the guerdon of thy paine.<p>
 
And therewithall he fiercely at him flew,<br>
And with importune outrage him assayld;<br>
Who soone prepard to field, his sword forth drew,<br>
And him with equall value counteruayld:<br>
Their mightie strokes their haberieons dismayld,<br>
And naked made each others manly spalles;<br>
The mortall steele despiteously entayld<br>
Deepe in their flesh, quite through the yron walles,<br>
That a large purple streme adown their giambeux falles.<p>
 
<i>Cymochles</i>, that had neuer met before<br>
So puissant foe, with enuious despight<br>
His proud presumed force increased more,<br>
Disdeigning to be held so long in fight;<br>
Sir <i>Guyon</i> grudging not so much his might,<br>
As those vnknightly raylings, which he spoke,<br>
With wrathfull fire his courage kindled bright,<br>
Thereof deuising shortly to be wroke,<br>
And doubling all his powres, redoubled euery stroke.<p>
 
Both of them high attonce their hands enhaunst,<br>
And both attonce their huge blowes downe did sway;<br>
<i>Cymochles</i> sword on <i>Guyons</i> shield yglaunst,<br>
And thereof nigh one quarter sheard away;<br>
But <i>Guyons</i> angry blade so fierce did play<br>
On th'others helmet, which as <i>Titan</i> shone,<br>
That quite it cloue his plumed crest in tway,<br>
And bared all his head vnto the bone;<br>
Wherewith astonisht, still he stood, as senselesse stone.<p>
 
Still as he stood, faire <i>Ph&aelig;dria</i>, that beheld<br>
That deadly daunger, soone atweene them ran;<br>
And at their feet her selfe most humbly feld,<br>
Crying with pitteous voice, and count'nance wan;<br>
Ah well away, most noble Lords, how can<br>
Your cruell eyes endure so pitteous sight,<br>
To shed your liues on ground? wo worth the man,<br>
That first did teach the cursed steele to bight<br>
In his owne flesh, and make way to the liuing spright.<p>
 
If euer loue of Ladie did empierce<br>
Your yron brestes, or pittie could find place,<br>
Withhold your bloudie hands from battell fierce,<br>
And sith for me ye fight, to me this grace<br>
Both yeeld, to stay your deadly strife a space.<br>
They stayd a while: and forth she gan proceed:<br>
Most wretched woman, and of wicked race,<br>
That am the author of this hainous deed,<br>
And cause of death betweene two doughtie knights doe breed.<p>
 
But if for me ye fight, or me will serue,<br>
Not this rude kind of battell, nor these armes<br>
Are meet, the which doe men in bale to sterue,<br>
And dolefull sorrow heape with deadly harmes:<br>
Such cruell game my scarmoges disarmes:<br>
Another warre, and other weapons I<br>
Doe loue, where loue does giue his sweet alarmes,<br>
Without bloudshed, and where the enemy<br>
Does yeeld vnto his foe a pleasant victory.<p>
 
Debatefull strife, and cruell enmitie<br>
The famous name of knighthood fowly shend;<br>
But louely peace, and gentle amitie,<br>
And in Amours the passing houres to spend,<br>
The mightie martiall hands doe most commend;<br>
Of loue they euer greater glory bore,<br>
Then of their armes: <i>Mars</i> is <i>Cupidoes</i> frend,<br>
And is for <i>Venus</i> loues renowmed more,<br>
Then all his wars and spoiles, the which he did of yore.<p>
 
Therewith she sweetly smyld.  They though full bent,<br>
To proue extremities of bloudie fight,<br>
Yet at her speach their rages gan relent,<br>
And calme the sea of their tempestuous spight,<br>
Such powre haue pleasing words: such is the might<br>
Of courteous clemencie in gentle hart.<br>
Now after all was ceast, the Faery knight<br>
Besought that Damzell suffer him depart,<br>
And yield him readie passage to that other part.<p>
 
She no lesse glad, then he desirous was<br>
Of his departure thence; for of her ioy<br>
And vaine delight she saw he light did pas,<br>
A foe of folly and immodest toy,<br>
Still solemne sad, or still disdainfull coy,<br>
Delighting all in armes and cruell warre,<br>
That her sweet peace and pleasures did annoy,<br>
Troubled with terrour and vnquiet iarre,<br>
That she well pleased was thence to amoue him farre.<p>
 
Tho him she brought abord, and her swift bote<br>
Forthwith directed to that further strand;<br>
The which on the dull waues did lightly flote<br>
And soone arriued on the shallow sand,<br>
Where gladsome <i>Guyon</i> salied forth to land,<br>
And to that Damzell thankes gaue for reward.<br>
Vpon that shore he spied <i>Atin</i> stand,<br>
There by his maister left, when late he far'd<br>
In <i>Ph&aelig;drias</i> flit barke ouer that perlous shard.<p>
 
Well could he him remember, sith of late<br>
He with <i>Pyrrochles</i> sharp debatement made;<br>
Streight gan he him reuile, and bitter rate,<br>
As shepheards curre, that in darke euenings shade<br>
Hath tracted forth some saluage beastes trade;<br>
Vile Miscreant (said he) whither doest thou flie<br>
The shame and death, which will thee soone inuade?<br>
What coward hand shall doe thee next to die,<br>
That art thus foully fled from famous enemie?<p>
 
With that he stiffely shooke his steelehead dart:<br>
But sober <i>Guyon</i>, hearing him so raile,<br>
Though somewhat moued in his mightie hart,<br>
Yet with strong reason maistred passion fraile,<br>
And passed fairely forth.  He turning taile,<br>
Backe to the strond retyrd, and there still stayd,<br>
Awaiting passage, which him late did faile;<br>
The whiles <i>Cymochles</i> with that wanton mayd<br>
The hastie heat of his auowd reuenge delayd.<p>
 
Whylest there the varlet stood, he saw from farre<br>
An armed knight, that towards him fast ran,<br>
He ran on foot, as if in lucklesse warre<br>
His forlorne steed from him the victour wan;<br>
He seemed breathlesse, hartlesse, faint, and wan,<br>
And all his armour sprinckled was with bloud,<br>
And soyld with durtie gore, that no man can<br>
Discerne the hew thereof.  He neuer stood,<br>
But bent his hastie course towards the idle flood.<p>
 
The varlet saw, when to the flood he came,<br>
How without stop or stay he fiercely lept,<br>
And deepe him selfe beduked in the same,<br>
That in the lake his loftie crest was steept,<br>
Ne of his safetie seemed care he kept,<br>
But with his raging armes he rudely flasht,<br>
The waues about, and all his armour swept,<br>
That all the bloud and filth away was washt,<br>
Yet still he bet the water, and the billowes dasht.<p>
 
<i>Atin</i> drew nigh, to weet what it mote bee;<br>
For much he wondred at that vncouth sight;<br>
Whom should he, but his owne deare Lord, there see,<br>
His owne deare Lord <i>Pyrrochles</i>, in sad plight,<br>
Readie to drowne himselfe for fell despight.<br>
Harrow now out, and well away, he cryde,<br>
What dismall day hath lent this cursed light,<br>
To see my Lord so deadly damnifyde<br>
<i>Pyrrochles</i>, &ocirc; <i>Pyrrochles</i>, what is thee betyde?<p>
 
I burne, I burne, I burne, then loud he cryde,<br>
O how I burne with implacable fire,<br>
Yet nought can quench mine inly flaming syde,<br>
Nor sea of licour cold, nor lake of mire,<br>
Nothing but death can doe me to respire.<br>
Ah be it (said he) from <i>Pyrrochles</i> farre<br>
After pursewing death once to require,<br>
Or think, that ought those puissant hands may marre:<br>
Death is for wretches borne vnder vnhappie starre.<p>
 
Perdie, then is it fit for me (said he)<br>
That am, I weene, most wretched man aliue,<br>
Burning in flames, yet no flames can I see,<br>
And dying daily, daily yet reuiue:<br>
O <i>Atin</i>, helpe to me last death to giue.<br>
The varlet at his plaint was grieu'd so sore,<br>
That his deepe wounded hart in two did riue,<br>
And his owne health remembring now no more,<br>
Did follow that ensample, which he blam'd afore.<p>
 
Into the lake he lept, his Lord to ayd,<br>
(So Loue the dread of daunger doth despise)<br>
And of him catching hold him strongly stayd<br>
From drowning.  But more happie he, then wise<br>
Of that seas nature did him not auise.<br>
The waues thereof so slow and sluggish were,<br>
Engrost with mud, which did them foule agrise,<br>
That euery weightie thing they did vpbeare,<br>
Ne ought mote euer sinke downe to the bottome there.<p>
 
Whiles thus they strugled in that idle waue,<br>
And stroue in vaine, the one himselfe to drowne,<br>
The other both from drowning for to saue,<br>
Lo, to that shore one in an auncient gowne,<br>
Whose hoarie locks great grauitie did crowne,<br>
Holding in hand a goodly arming sword,<br>
By fortune came, led with the troublous sowne:<br>
Where drenched deepe he found in that dull ford<br>
The carefull seruant, striuing with his raging Lord.<p>
 
Him <i>Atin</i> spying, knew right well of yore,<br>
And loudly cald, Helpe helpe, &ocirc; <i>Archimage</i>;<br>
To saue my Lord, in wretched plight forlore;<br>
Helpe with thy hand, or with thy counsell sage:<br>
Weake hands, but counsell is most strong in age.<br>
Him when the old man saw, he wondred sore,<br>
To see <i>Pyrrochles</i> there so rudely rage:<br>
Yet sithens helpe, he saw, he needed more<br>
Then pittie, he in hast approched to the shore.<p>
 
And cald, <i>Pyrrochles</i>, what is this, I see?<br>
What hellish furie hath at earst thee hent?<br>
Furious euer I thee knew to bee,<br>
Yet neuer in this straunge astonishment.<br>
These flames, these flames (he cryde) do me torment.<br>
What flames (quoth he) when I thee present see,<br>
In daunger rather to be drent, then brent?<br>
Harrow, the flames, which me consume (said hee)<br>
Ne can be quencht, within my secret bowels bee.<p>
 
That cursed man, that cruell feend of hell,<br>
<i>Furor</i>, oh <i>Furor</i> hath me thus bedight:<br>
His deadly wounds within my liuers swell,<br>
And his whot fire burnes in mine entrails bright,<br>
Kindled through his infernall brond of spight,<br>
Sith late with him I batteil vaine would boste;<br>
That now I weene <i>Ioues</i> dreaded thunder light<br>
Does scorch not halfe so sore, nor damned ghoste<br>
In flaming <i>Phlegeton</i> does not so felly roste.<p>
 
Which when as <i>Archimago</i> heard, his griefe<br>
He knew right well, and him attonce disarmd:<br>
Then searcht his secret wounds, and made a priefe<br>
Of euery place, that was with brusing harmd,<br>
Or with the hidden fire too inly warmd.<br>
Which done, he balmes and herbes thereto applyde,<br>
And eue[r]more with mighty spels them charmd,<br>
That in short space he has them qualifyde,<br>
And him restor'd to health, that would haue algates dyde.<p>
