*Cant. X.*

> *Paridell rapeth Hellenore:  
> Malbecco her pursewes:  
> Findes emongst Satyres, whence with him  
> To turne she doth refuse.*

> T He morow next, so soone as *Phoebus* Lamp  
> Bewrayed had the world with early light,  
> And fresh *Aurora* had the shady damp  
> Out of the goodly heauen amoued quight,  
> Faire *Britomart* and that same *Faerie* knight  
> Vprose, forth on their iourney for to wend:  
> But *Paridell* complaynd, that his late fight  
> With *Britomart*, so sore did him offend,  
> That ryde he could not, till his hurts he did amend.
>
> So forth they far'd, but he behind them stayd,  
> Maulgre his host, who grudged grieuously,  
> To house a guest, that would be needes obayd,  
> And of his owne him left not liberty:  
> Might wanting measure moueth surquedry.  
> Two things he feared, but the third was death;  
> That fierce young mans vnruly maistery;  
> His money, which he lou'd as liuing breath;  
> And his faire wife, whom honest long he kept vneath.
>
> But patience perforce he must abie,  
> What fortune and his fate on him will lay,  
> Fond is the feare, that findes no remedie;  
> Yet warily he watcheth euery way,  
> By which he feareth euill happen may:  
> So th'euill thinkes by watching to preuent;  
> Ne doth he suffer her, nor night, nor day,  
> Out of his sight her selfe once to absent.  
> So doth he punish her and eke himselfe torment.
>
> But *Paridell* kept better watch, then hee,  
> A fit occasion for his turne to find:  
> False loue, why do men say, thou canst not see,  
> And in their foolish fancie feigne thee blind,  
> That with thy charmes the sharpest sight doest bind,  
> And to thy will abuse? Thou walkest free,  
> And seest euery secret of the mind;  
> Thou seest all, yet none at all sees thee;  
> All that is by the working of thy Deitee.
>
> So perfect in that art was *Paridell*,  
> That he *Malbeccoes* halfen eye did wyle,  
> His halfen eye he wiled wondrous well,  
> And *Hellenors* both eyes did eke beguyle,  
> Both eyes and hart attonce, during the whyle  
> That he there soiourned his wounds to heale;  
> That *Cupid* selfe it seeing, close did smyle,  
> To weet how he her loue away did steale,  
> And bad, that none their ioyous treason should reueale.
>
> The learned louer lost no time nor tyde,  
> That least auantage mote to him afford,  
> Yet bore so faire a saile, that none espyde  
> His secret drift, till he her layd abord.  
> When so in open place, and commune bord,  
> He fortun'd her to meet, with commune speach  
> He courted her, yet bayted euery word,  
> That his vngentle hoste n'ote him appeach  
> Of vile vngentlenesse, or hospitages breach.
>
> But when apart (if euer her apart)  
> He found, then his false engins fast he plyde,  
> And all the sleights vnbosomd in his hart;  
> He sigh'd, he sobd, he swownd, he perdy dyde,  
> And cast himselfe on ground her fast besyde:  
> Tho when againe he him bethought to liue,  
> He wept, and wayld, and false laments belyde,  
> Saying, but if she Mercie would him giue  
> That he mote algates dye, yet did his death forgiue.
>
> And otherwhiles with amorous delights,  
> And pleasing toyes he would her entertaine,  
> Now singing sweetly, to surprise her sprights,  
> Now making layes of loue and louers paine,  
> Bransles, Ballads, virelayes, and verses vaine;  
> Oft purposes, oft riddles he deuysd,  
> And thousands like, which flowed in his braine,  
> With which he fed her fancie, and entysd  
> To take to his new loue, and leaue her old despysd.
>
> And euery where he might, and euery while  
> He did her seruice dewtifull, and sewed  
> At hand with humble pride, and pleasing guile,  
> So closely yet, that none but she it vewed,  
> Who well perceiued all, and all indewed.  
> Thus finely did he his false nets dispred,  
> With which he many weake harts had subdewed  
> Of yore, and many had ylike misled:  
> What wonder then, if she were likewise carried?
>
> No fort so fensible, no wals so strong,  
> But that continuall battery will riue,  
> Or daily siege through dispuruayance long,  
> And lacke of reskewes will to parley driue;  
> And Peece, that vnto parley eare will giue,  
> Will shortly yeeld it selfe, and will be made  
> The vassall of the victors will byliue:  
> That stratageme had oftentimes assayd  
> This crafty Paramoure, and now it plaine displayd.
>
> For through his traines he her intrapped hath,  
> That she her loue and hart hath wholy sold  
> To him, without regard of gaine, or scath,  
> Or care of credite, or of husband old,  
> Whom she hath vow'd to dub a faire Cucquold.  
> Nought wants but time and place, which shortly shee  
> Deuized hath, and to her louer told.  
> It pleased well. So well they both agree;  
> So readie rype to ill, ill wemens counsels bee.
>
> Darke was the Euening, fit for louers stealth,  
> When chaunst *Malbecco* busie be elsewhere,  
> She to his closet went, where all his wealth  
> Lay hid: thereof she countlesse summes did reare,  
> The which she meant away with her to beare;  
> The rest she fyr'd for sport, or for despight;  
> As *Hellene*, when she saw aloft appeare  
> The *Troiane* flames, and reach to heauens hight  
> Did clap her hands, and ioyed at that dolefull sight.
>
> This second *Hellene*, faire Dame *Hellenore*,  
> The whiles her husband ranne with sory haste,  
> To quench the flames, which she had tyn'd before,  
> Laught at his foolish labour spent in waste;  
> And ranne into her louers armes right fast;  
> Where streight embraced, she to him did cry,  
> And call aloud for helpe, ere helpe were past;  
> For loe that Guest would beare her forcibly,  
> And meant to rauish her, that rather had to dy.
>
> The wretched man hearing her call for ayd,  
> And readie seeing him with her to fly,  
> In his disquiet mind was much dismayd:  
> But when againe he backward cast his eye,  
> And saw the wicked fire so furiously  
> Consume his hart, and scorch his Idoles face,  
> He was therewith distressed diuersly,  
> Ne wist he how to turne, nor to what place;  
> Was neuer wretched man in such a wofull cace.
>
> Ay when to him she cryde, to her he turnd,  
> And left the fire; loue money ouercame:  
> But when he marked, how his money burnd,  
> He left his wife; money did loue disclame:  
> Both was he loth to loose his loued Dame,  
> And loth to leaue his liefest pelfe behind,  
> Yet sith he n'ote saue both, he sau'd that same,  
> Which was the dearest to his donghill mind,  
> The God of his desire, the ioy of misers blind.
>
> Thus whilest all things in troublous vprore were,  
> And all men busie to suppresse the flame,  
> The louing couple need no reskew feare,  
> But leasure had, and libertie to frame  
> Their purpost flight, free from all mens reclame;  
> And Night, the patronesse of loue-stealth faire,  
> Gaue them safe conduct, till to end they came:  
> So bene they gone yfeare, a wanton paire  
> Of louers loosely knit, where list them to repaire.
>
> Soone as the cruell flames yslaked were,  
> *Malbecco* seeing, how his losse did lye,  
> Out of the flames, which he had quencht whylere  
> Into huge waues of griefe and gealosye  
> Full deepe emplonged was, and drowned nye,  
> Twixt inward doole and felonous despight;  
> He rau'd, he wept, he stampt, he lowd did cry,  
> And all the passions, that in man may light,  
> Did him attonce oppresse, and vex his caytiue spright.
>
> Long thus he chawd the cud of inward griefe,  
> And did consume his gall with anguish sore,  
> Still when he mused on his late mischiefe,  
> Then still the smart thereof increased more,  
> And seem'd more grieuous, then it was before:  
> At last when sorrow he saw booted nought,  
> Ne griefe might not his loue to him restore,  
> He gan deuise, how her he reskew mought,  
> Ten thousand wayes he cast in his confused thought.
>
> At last resoluing, like a pilgrim pore,  
> To sea\[r\]ch her forth, where so she might be fond,  
> And bearing with him treasure in close store,  
> The rest he leaues in ground: so takes in hond  
> To seeke her endlong, both by sea and lond.  
> Long he her sought, he sought her farre and nere,  
> And euery where that he mote vnderstond,  
> Of knights and ladies any meetings were,  
> And of eachone he met, he tydings did inquere.
>
> But all in vaine, his woman was too wise,  
> Euer to come into his clouch againe,  
> And he too simple euer to surprise  
> The iolly *Paridell*, for all his paine.  
> One day, as he forpassed by the plaine  
> With weary pace, he farre away espide  
> A couple, seeming well to be his twaine,  
> Which houed close vnder a forrest side,  
> As if they lay in wait, or else themselues did hide.
>
> Well weened he, that those the same mote bee,  
> And as he better did their shape auize,  
> Him seemed more their manner did agree;  
> For th'one was armed all in warlike wize,  
> Whom, to be *Paridell* he did deuize;  
> And th'other all yclad in garments light,  
> Discolour'd like to womanish disguise,  
> He did resemble to his Ladie bright;  
> And euer his faint hart much earned at the sight.
>
> And euer faine he towards them would goe,  
> But yet durst not for dread approchen nie,  
> But stood aloofe, vnweeting what to doe;  
> Till that prickt forth with loues extremitie,  
> That is the father of fowle gealosy,  
> He closely nearer crept, the truth to weet:  
> But, as he nigher drew, he easily  
> Might scerne, that it was not his sweetest sweet,  
> Ne yet her Belamour, the partner of his sheet.
>
> But it was scornefull *Braggadocchio*,  
> That with his seruant *Trompart* houerd there,  
> Sith late he fled from his too earnest foe:  
> Whom such when as *Malbecco* spyed clere,  
> He turned backe, and would haue fled arere;  
> Till *Trompart* ronning hastily, him did stay,  
> And bad before his soueraine Lord appere:  
> That was him loth, yet durst he not gainesay,  
> And comming him before, low louted on the lay.
>
> The Boaster at him sternely bent his browe,  
> As if he could haue kild him with his looke,  
> That to the ground him meekely made to bowe,  
> And awfull terror deepe into him strooke,  
> That euery member of his bodie quooke.  
> Said he, thou man of nought, what doest thou here,  
> Vnfitly furnisht with thy bag and booke,  
> Where I expected one with shield and spere,  
> To proue some deedes of armes vpon an equall pere.
>
> The wretched man at his imperious speach,  
> Was all abasht, and low prostrating, said;  
> Good Sir, let not my rudenesse be no breach  
> Vnto your patience, ne be ill ypaid;  
> For I vnwares this way by fortune straid,  
> A silly Pilgrim driuen to distresse,  
> That seeke a Lady,---There he suddein staid,  
> And did the rest with grieuous sighes suppresse,  
> While teares stood in his eies, few drops of bitternesse.
>
> What Ladie, man? (said *Trompart*) take good hart,  
> And tell thy griefe, if any hidden lye;  
> Was neuer better time to shew thy smart,  
> Then now, that noble succour is thee by,  
> That is the whole worlds commune remedy.  
> That cheareful word his weake hart much did cheare,  
> And with vaine hope his spirits faint supply,  
> That bold he said; ô most redoubted Pere,  
> Vouchsafe with mild regard a wretches cace to heare.
>
> Then sighing sore, It is not long (said he)  
> Sith I enioyd the gentlest Dame aliue;  
> Of whom a knight, no knight at all perdee,  
> But shame of all, that doe for honor striue,  
> By treacherous deceipt did me depriue;  
> Through open outrage he her bore away,  
> And with fowle force vnto his will did driue,  
> Which all good knights, that armes do beare this day,  
> Are bound for to reuenge, and punish if they may.
>
> And you most noble Lord, that can and dare  
> Redresse the wrong of miserable wight,  
> Cannot employ your most victorious speare  
> In better quarrell, then defence of right,  
> And for a Ladie gainst a faithlesse knight;  
> So shall your glory be aduaunced much,  
> And all faire Ladies magnifie your might,  
> And eke my selfe, albe I simple such,  
> Your worthy paine shall well reward with guerdon rich.
>
> With that out of his bouget forth he drew  
> Great store of treasure, therewith him to tempt;  
> But he on it lookt scornefully askew,  
> As much disdeigning to be so misdempt,  
> Or a war-monger to be basely nempt;  
> And said; Thy offers base I greatly loth,  
> And eke thy words vncourteous and vnkempt;  
> I tread in dust thee and thy money both,  
> That, were it not for shame,---So turned from him wroth.
>
> But *Trompart*, that his maisters humor knew,  
> In lofty lookes to hide an humble mind,  
> Was inly tickled with that golden vew,  
> And in his eare him rounded close behind:  
> Yet stoupt he not, but lay still in the wind,  
> Waiting aduauntage on the pray to sease;  
> Till *Trompart* lowly to the ground inclind,  
> Besought him his great courage to appease,  
> And pardon simple man, that rash did him displease.
>
> Bigge looking like a doughtie Doucepere,  
> At last he thus; Thou clod of vilest clay,  
> I pardon yield, and with thy rudenesse beare;  
> But weete henceforth, that all that golden pray,  
> And all that else the vaine world vaunten may,  
> I loath as doung, ne deeme my dew reward:  
> Fame is my meed, and glory vertues pray.  
> But minds of mortall men are muchell mard,  
> And mou'd amisse with massie mucks vnmeet regard.
>
> And more, I graunt to thy great miserie  
> Gratious respect, thy wife shall backe be sent,  
> And that vile knight, who euer that he bee,  
> Which hath thy Lady reft, and knighthood shent,  
> By *Sanglamort* my sword, whose deadly dent  
> The bloud hath of so many thousands shed,  
> I sweare, ere long shall dearely it repent;  
> Ne he twixt heauen and earth shall hide his hed,  
> But soone he shall be found, and shortly doen be ded.
>
> The foolish man thereat woxe wondrous blith,  
> As if the word so spoken, were halfe donne,  
> And humbly thanked him a thousand sith,  
> That had from death to life him newly wonne.  
> Tho forth the Boaster marching, braue begonne  
> His stolen steed to thunder furiously,  
> As if he heauen and hell would ouerronne,  
> And all the world confound with cruelty,  
> That much *Malbecco* ioyed in his iollity.
>
> Thus long they three together traueiled,  
> Through many a wood, and many an vncouth way,  
> To seeke his wife, that was farre wandered:  
> But those two sought nought, but the present pray,  
> To weete the treasure, which he did bewray,  
> On which their eies and harts were wholly set,  
> With purpose, how they might it best betray;  
> For sith the houre, that first he did them let  
> The same behold, therewith their keene desires were whet.
>
> It fortuned as they together far'd,  
> They spide, where *Paridell* came pricking fast  
> Vpon the plaine, the which himselfe prepar'd  
> To giust with that braue straunger knight a cast,  
> As on aduenture by the way he past:  
> Alone he rode without his Paragone;  
> For hauing filcht her bels, her vp he cast  
> To the wide world, and let her fly alone,  
> He nould be clogd. So had he serued many one.
>
> The gentle Lady, loose at randon left,  
> The greene-wood long did walke, and wander wide  
> At wilde aduenture, like a forlorne weft,  
> Till on a day the *Satyres* her espide  
> Straying alone withouten groome or guide;  
> Her vp they tooke, and with them home her led,  
> With them as housewife euer to abide,  
> To milk their gotes, and make them cheese and bred,  
> And euery one as commune good her handeled.
>
> That shortly she *Malbecco* has forgot,  
> And eke Sir *Paridell*, all were he deare;  
> Who from her went to seeke another lot,  
> And now by fortune was arriued here,  
> Where those two guilers with *Malbecco* were:  
> Soone as the old man saw Sir *Paridell*,  
> He fainted, and was almost dead with feare,  
> Ne word he had to speake, his griefe to tell,  
> But to him louted low, and greeted goodly well.
>
> And after asked him for *Hellenore*,  
> I take no keepe of her (said *Paridell*)  
> She wonneth in the forrest there before.  
> So forth he rode, as his aduenture fell;  
> The whiles the Boaster from his loftie sell  
> Faynd to alight, something amisse to mend;  
> But the fresh Swayne would not his leasure dwell,  
> But went his way; whom when he passed kend,  
> He vp remounted light, and after faind to wend.
>
> Perdy nay (said *Malbecco*) shall ye not:  
> But let him passe as lightly, as he came:  
> For litle good of him is to be got,  
> And mickle perill to be put to shame.  
> But let vs go to seeke my dearest Dame,  
> Whom he hath left in yonder forrest wyld:  
> For of her safety in great doubt I am,  
> Least saluage beastes her person haue despoyld:  
> Then all the world is lost, and we in vaine haue toyld.
>
> They all agree, and forward them addrest:  
> Ah but (said craftie *Trompart*) weete ye well,  
> That yonder in that wastefull wildernesse  
> Huge monsters haunt, and many dangers dwell;  
> Dragons, and Minotaures, and feendes of hell,  
> And many wilde woodmen, which robbe and rend  
> All trauellers; therefore aduise ye well,  
> Before ye enterprise that way to wend:  
> One may his iourney bring too soone to euill end.
>
> *Malbecco* stopt in great astonishment,  
> And with pale eyes fast fixed on the rest,  
> Their counsell crau'd, in daunger imminent.  
> Said *Trompart*, You that are the most opprest  
> With burden of great treasure, I thinke best  
> Here for to stay in safetie behind;  
> My Lord and I will search the wide forrest.  
> That counsell pleased not *Malbeccoes* mind;  
> For he was much affraid, himselfe alone to find.
>
> Then is it best (said he) that ye doe leaue  
> Your treasure here in some securitie,  
> Either fast closed in some hollow greaue,  
> Or buried in the ground from ieopardie,  
> Till we returne againe in safetie:  
> As for vs two, least doubt of vs ye haue,  
> Hence farre away we will blindfolded lie,  
> Ne priuie be vnto your treasures graue.  
> It pleased: so he did, Then they march forward braue.
>
> Now when amid the thickest woods they were,  
> They heard a noyse of many bagpipes shrill,  
> And shrieking Hububs them approching nere,  
> Which all the forrest did with horror fill:  
> That dreadfull sound the boasters hart did thrill,  
> With such amazement, that in haste he fled,  
> Ne euer looked backe for good or ill,  
> And after him eke fearefull *Trompart* sped;  
> The old man could not fly, but fell to ground halfe ded.
>
> Yet afterwards close creeping, as he might,  
> He in a bush did hide his fearefull hed,  
> The iolly *Satyres* full of fresh delight,  
> Came dauncing forth, and with them nimbly led  
> Faire *Hellenore*, with girlonds all bespred,  
> Whom their May-lady they had newly made:  
> She proud of that new honour, which they red,  
> And of their louely fellowship full glade,  
> Daunst liuely, and her face did with a Lawrell shade.
>
> The silly man that in the thicket lay  
> Saw all this goodly sport, and grieued sore,  
> Yet durst he not against it doe or say,  
> But did his hart with bitter thoughts engore,  
> To see th'vnkindnesse of his *Hellenore*.  
> All day they daunced with great lustihed,  
> And with their horned feet the greene grasse wore,  
> The whiles their Gotes vpon the brouzes fed,  
> Till drouping *Phoebus* gan to hide his golden hed.
>
> Tho vp they gan their merry pypes to trusse,  
> And all their goodly heards did gather round,  
> But euery *Satyre* first did giue a busse  
> To *Hellenore*: so busses did abound.  
> Now gan the humid vapour shed the ground  
> With perly deaw, and th'Earthes gloomy shade  
> Did dim the brightnesse of the welkin round,  
> That euery bird and beast awarned made,  
> To shrowd themselues, whiles sleepe their senses did inuade.
>
> Which when *Malbecco* saw, out of his bush  
> Vpon his hands and feete he crept full light,  
> And like a Gote emongst the Gotes did rush,  
> That through the helpe of his faire hornes on hight,  
> And misty dampe of misconceiuing night,  
> And eke through likenesse of his gotish beard,  
> He did the better counterfeite aright:  
> So home he marcht emongst the horned heard,  
> That none of all the *Satyres* him espyde or heard.
>
> At night, when all they went to sleepe, he vewd,  
> Whereas his louely wife emongst them lay,  
> Embraced of a *Satyre* rough and rude,  
> Who all the night did minde his ioyous play:  
> Nine times he heard him come aloft ere day,  
> That all his hart with gealosie did swell;  
> But yet that nights ensample did bewray,  
> That not for nought his wife them loued so well,  
> When one so oft a night did ring his matins bell.
>
> So closely as he could, he to them crept,  
> When wearie of their sport to sleepe they fell,  
> And to his wife, that now full soundly slept,  
> He whispered in her eare, and did her tell,  
> That it was he, which by her side did dwell,  
> And therefore prayd her wake, to heare him plaine.  
> As one out of a dreame not waked well,  
> She turned her, and returned backe againe:  
> Yet her for to awake he did the more constraine.
>
> At last with irkesome trouble she abrayd;  
> And then perceiuing, that it was indeed  
> Her old *Malbecco*, which did her vpbrayd,  
> With loosenesse of her loue, and loathly deed,  
> She was astonisht with exceeding dreed,  
> And would haue wakt the *Satyre* by her syde;  
> But he her prayd, for mercy, or for meed,  
> To saue his life, ne let him be descryde,  
> But hearken to his lore, and all his counsell hyde.
>
> Tho gan he her perswade, to leaue that lewd  
> And loathsome life, of God and man abhord,  
> And home returne, where all should be renewd  
> With perfect peace, and bandes of fresh accord,  
> And she receiu'd againe to bed and bord,  
> As if no trespasse euer had bene donne:  
> But she it all refused at one word,  
> And by no meanes would to his will be wonne,  
> But chose emongst the iolly *Satyres* still to wonne.
>
> He wooed her, till day spring he espyde;  
> But all in vaine: and then turnd to the heard,  
> Who butted him with hornes on euery syde,  
> And trode downe in the durt, where his hore beard  
> Was fowly dight, and he of death afeard.  
> Early before the heauens fairest light  
> Out of the ruddy East was fully reard,  
> The heardes out of their foldes were loosed quight,  
> And he emongst the rest crept forth in sory plight.
>
> So soone as he the Prison dore did pas,  
> He ran as fast, as both his feete could beare,  
> And neuer looked, who behind him was,  
> Ne scarsely who before: like as a Beare  
> That creeping close, amongst the hiues to reare  
> An hony combe, the wakefull dogs espy,  
> And him assayling, sore his carkasse teare,  
> That hardly he with life away does fly,  
> Ne stayes, till safe himselfe he see from ieopardy.
>
> Ne stayd he, till he came vnto the place,  
> Where late his treasure he entombed had,  
> Where when he found it not (for *Trompart* bace  
> Had it purloyned for his maister bad:)  
> With extreme fury he became quite mad,  
> And ran away, ran with himselfe away:  
> That who so straungely had him seene bestad,  
> With vpstart haire, and staring eyes dismay,  
> From Limbo lake him late escaped sure would say.
>
> High ouer hilles and ouer dales he fled,  
> As if the wind him on his winges had borne,  
> Ne banck nor bush could stay him, when he sped  
> His nimble feet, as treading still on thorne:  
> Griefe, and despight, and gealosie, and scorne  
> Did all the way him follow hard behind,  
> And he himselfe himselfe loath'd so forlorne,  
> So shamefully forlorne of womankind;  
> That as a Snake, still lurked in his wounded mind.
>
> Still fled he forward, looking backward still,  
> Ne stayd his flight, nor fearefull agony,  
> Till that he came vnto a rockie hill,  
> Ouer the sea, suspended dreadfully,  
> That liuing creature it would terrify,  
> To looke adowne, or vpward to the hight:  
> From thence he threw himselfe dispiteously,  
> All desperate of his fore-damned spright,  
> That seem'd no helpe for him was left in liuing sight.
>
> But through long anguish, and selfe-murdring thought  
> He was so wasted and forpined quight,  
> That all his substance was consum'd to nought,  
> And nothing left, but like an aery Spright,  
> That on the rockes he fell so flit and light,  
> That he thereby receiu'd no hurt at all,  
> But chaunced on a craggy cliff to light;  
> Whence he with crooked clawes so long did crall,  
> That at the last he found a caue with entrance small.
>
> Into the same he creepes, and thenceforth there  
> Resolu'd to build his balefull mansion,  
> In drery darkenesse, and continuall feare  
> Of that rockes fall, which euer and anon  
> Threates with huge ruine him to fall vpon,  
> That he dare neuer sleepe, but that one eye  
> Still ope he keepes for that occasion;  
> Ne euer rests he in tranquillity,  
> The roring billowes beat his bowre so boystrously.
>
> Ne euer is he wont on ought to feed,  
> But toades and frogs, his pasture poysonous,  
> Which in his cold complexion do breed  
> A filthy bloud, or humour rancorous,  
> Matter of doubt and dread suspitious,  
> That doth with curelesse care consume the hart,  
> Corrupts the stomacke with gall vitious,  
> Croscuts the liuer with internall smart,  
> And doth transfixe the soule with deathes eternall dart.
>
> Yet can he neuer dye, but dying liues,  
> And doth himselfe with sorrow new sustaine,  
> That death and life attonce vnto him giues.  
> And painefull pleasure turnes to pleasing paine.  
> There dwels he euer, miserable swaine,  
> Hatefull both to him selfe, and euery wight;  
> Where he through priuy griefe, and horrour vaine,  
> Is woxen so deform'd, that he has quight  
> Forgot he was a man, and *Gealosie* is hight.
