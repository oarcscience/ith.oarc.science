<blockquote>
<i>Britomart comes to Isis Church,<br>
Where shee strange visions sees:<br>
She fights with Radigund, her slaies,<br>
And Artegall thence frees.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
N
Ought is on earth more sacred or diuine,<br>
That Gods and men doe equally adore,<br>
Then this same vertue, that doth right define:<br>
For th'heuens th&#7869;selues, whence mortal men implore<br>
Right in their wrongs, are rul'd by righteous lore<br>
Of highest Ioue, who doth true iustice deale<br>
To his inferiour Gods, and euermore<br>
Therewith containes his heauenly Common-weale,<br>
The skill whereof to Princes hearts he doth reueale.<p>

Well therefore did the antique world inuent,<br>
That Iustice was a God of soueraine grace,<br>
And altars vnto him, and temples lent,<br>
And heauenly honours in the highest place;<br>
Calling him great <i>Osyris</i>, of the race<br>
Of th'old &AElig;gyptian Kings, that whylome were;<br>
With fayned colours shading a true case:<br>
For that <i>Osyris</i>, whilest he liued here,<br>
The iustest man aliue, and truest did appeare.<p>

His wife was <i>Isis</i>, whom they likewise made<br>
A Goddesse of great powre and souerainty<br>
And in her person cunningly did shade<br>
That part of Iustice, which is Equity,<br>
Whereof I haue to treat here presently.<br>
Vnto whose temple when as <i>Britomart</i><br>
Arriued, shee with great humility<br>
Did enter in, ne would that night depart;<br>
But <i>Talus</i> mote not be admitted to her part.<p>

There she receiued was in goodly wize<br>
Of many Priests, which duely did attend<br>
Vppon the rites and daily sacrifize,<br>
All clad in linnen robes with siluer hemd;<br>
And on their heads with long locks comely kemd,<br>
They wore rich Mitres shaped like the Moone,<br>
To shew that <i>Isis</i> doth the Moone portend;<br>
Like as <i>Osyris</i> signifies the Sunne.<br>
For that they both like race in equall iustice runne.<p>

The Championesse them greeting, as she could,<br>
Was thence by them into the Temple led;<br>
Whose goodly building when she did behould,<br>
Borne vppon stately pillours, all dispred<br>
With shining gold, and arched ouer hed,<br>
She wondred at the workemans passing skill,<br>
Whose like before she neuer saw nor red;<br>
And thereuppon long while stood gazing still,<br>
But thought, that she thereon could neuer gaze her fill.<p>

Thence forth vnto the Idoll they her brought,<br>
The which was framed all of siluer fine,<br>
So well as could with cunning hand be wrought,<br>
And clothed all in garments made of line,<br>
Hemd all about with fringe of siluer twine.<br>
Vppon her head she wore a Crowne of gold,<br>
To shew that she had powre in things diuine;<br>
And at her feete a Crocodile was rold,<br>
That with her wreathed taile her middle did enfold.<p>

One foote was set vppon the Crocodile,<br>
And on the ground the other fast did stand,<br>
So meaning to suppresse both forged guile,<br>
And open force: and in her other hand<br>
She stretched forth a long white sclender wand.<br>
Such was the Goddesse; whom when <i>Britomart</i><br>
Had long beheld, her selfe vppon the land<br>
She did prostrate, and with right humble hart,<br>
Vnto her selfe her silent prayers did impart.<p>

To which the Idoll as it were inclining,<br>
Her wand did moue with amiable looke,<br>
By outward shew her inward sence defining.<br>
Who well perceiuing, how her wand she shooke,<br>
It as a token of good fortune tooke.<br>
By this the day with dampe was ouercast,<br>
And ioyous light the house of <i>Ioue</i> forsooke:<br>
Which when she saw, her helmet she vnlaste,<br>
And by the altars side her selfe to slumber plaste.<p>

For other beds the Priests there vsed none,<br>
But on their mother Earths deare lap did lie,<br>
And bake their sides vppon the cold hard stone,<br>
T'enure them selues to sufferaunce thereby<br>
And proud rebellious flesh to mortify.<br>
For by the vow of their religion<br>
They tied were to stedfast chastity,<br>
And continence of life, that all forgon,<br>
They mote the better tend to their deuotion.<p>

Therefore they mote not taste of fleshly food,<br>
Ne feed on ought, the which doth bloud containe,<br>
Ne drinke of wine, for wine they say is blood,<br>
Euen the bloud of Gyants, which were slaine,<br>
By thundring Ioue in the Phlegrean plaine.<br>
For which the earth (as they the story tell)<br>
Wroth with the Gods, which to perpetuall paine<br>
Had damn'd her sonnes, which gainst them did rebell,<br>
With inward griefe and malice did against them swell.<p>

And of their vitall bloud, the which was shed<br>
Into her pregnant bosome, forth she brought<br>
The fruitfull vine, whose liquor blouddy red<br>
Hauing the mindes of men with fury fraught,<br>
Mote in them stirre vp old rebellious thought,<br>
To make new warre against the Gods againe:<br>
Such is the powre of that same fruit, that nought<br>
The fell contagion may thereof restraine,<br>
Ne within reasons rule, her madding mood containe.<p>

There did the warlike Maide her selfe repose,<br>
Vnder the wings of <i>Isis</i> all that night,<br>
And with sweete rest her heauy eyes did close,<br>
After that long daies toile and weary plight.<br>
Where whilest her earthly parts with soft delight<br>
Of sencelesse sleepe did deeply drowned lie,<br>
There did appeare vnto her heauenly spright<br>
A wondrous vision, which did close implie<br>
The course of all her fortune and posteritie.<p>

Her seem'd, as she was doing sacrifize<br>
To <i>Isis</i>, deckt with Mitre on her hed,<br>
And linnen stole after those Priestes guize,<br>
All sodainely she saw transfigured<br>
Her linnen stole to robe of scarlet red,<br>
And Moone-like Mitre to a Crowne of gold,<br>
That euen she her selfe much wondered<br>
At such a chaunge, and ioyed to behold<br>
Her selfe, adorn'd with gems and iewels manifold.<p>

And in the midst of her felicity,<br>
An hideous tempest seemed from below,<br>
To rise through all the Temple sodainely,<br>
That from the Altar all about did blow<br>
The holy fire, and all the embers strow<br>
Vppon the ground, which kindled priuily,<br>
Into outragious flames vnwares did grow,<br>
That all the Temple put in ieopardy<br>
Of flaming, and her selfe in great perplexity.<p>

With that the Crocodile, which sleeping lay<br>
Vnder the Idols feete in fearelesse bowre,<br>
Seem'd to awake in horrible dismay,<br>
As being troubled with that stormy stowre;<br>
And gaping greedy wide, did streight deuoure<br>
Both flames and tempest: with which growen great,<br>
And swolne with pride of his owne peerelesse powre,<br>
He gan to threaten her likewise to eat;<br>
But that the Goddesse with her rod him backe did beat.<p>

Tho turning all his pride to humblesse meeke,<br>
Him selfe before her feete he lowly threw,<br>
And gan for grace and loue of her to seeke:<br>
Which she accepting, he so neare her drew,<br>
That of his game she soone enwombed grew,<br>
And forth did bring a Lion of great might;<br>
That shortly did all other beasts subdew.<br>
With that she waked, full of fearefull fright,<br>
And doubtfully dismayd through that so vncouth sight.<p>

So thereuppon long while she musing lay,<br>
With thousand thoughts feeding her fantasie,<br>
Vntill she spide the lampe of lightsome day,<br>
Vp-lifted in the porch of heauen hie.<br>
Then vp she rose fraught with melancholy,<br>
And forth into the lower parts did pas;<br>
Whereas the Priestes she found full busily<br>
About their holy things for morrow Mas:<br>
Whom she saluting faire, faire resaluted was.<p>

But by the change of her vnchearefull looke,<br>
They might perceiue, she was not well in plight;<br>
Or that some pensiuenesse to heart she tooke.<br>
Therefore thus one of them, who seem'd in sight<br>
To be the greatest, and the grauest wight,<br>
To her bespake; Sir Knight it seemes to me,<br>
That thorough euill rest of this last night,<br>
Or ill apayd, or much dismayd ye be,<br>
That by your change of cheare is easie for to see.<p>

Certes (sayd she) sith ye so well haue spide<br>
The troublous passion of my pensiue mind,<br>
I will not seeke the same from you to hide,<br>
But will my cares vnfolde, in hope to find<br>
Your aide, to guide me out of errour blind.<br>
Say on (quoth he) the secret of your hart:<br>
For by the holy vow, which me doth bind,<br>
I am adiur'd, best counsell to impart<br>
To all, that shall require my comfort in their smart.<p>

Then gan she to declare the whole discourse<br>
Of all that vision, which to her appeard,<br>
As well as to her minde it had recourse.<br>
All which when he vnto the end had heard,<br>
Like to a weake faint-hearted man he fared,<br>
Through great astonishment of that strange sight;<br>
And with long locks vp-standing, stifly stared<br>
Like one adawed with some dreadfull spright.<br>
So fild with heauenly fury, thus he her behight.<p>

Magnificke Virgin, that in queint disguise<br>
Of British armes doest maske thy royall blood,<br>
So to pursue a perillous emprize,<br>
How coul[d]st thou weene, through that disguized hood,<br>
To hide thy state from being vnderstood?<br>
Can from th'immortall Gods ought hidden bee?<br>
They doe thy linage, and thy Lordly brood;<br>
They doe thy sire, lamenting sore for thee;<br>
They doe thy loue, forlorne in womens thraldome see.<p>

The end whereof, and all the long euent,<br>
They doe to thee in this same dreame discouer.<br>
For that same Crocodile doth represent<br>
The righteous Knight, that is thy faithfull louer.<br>
Like to <i>Osyris</i> in all iust endeuer.<br>
For that same Crocodile <i>Osyris</i> is,<br>
That vnder <i>Isis</i> feete doth sleepe for euer:<br>
To shew that clemence oft in things amis,<br>
Restraines those sterne behests, and cruell doomes of his.<p>

That Knight shall all the troublous stormes asswage,<br>
And raging flames, that many foes shall reare,<br>
To hinder thee from the iust heritage<br>
Of thy sires Crowne, and from thy countrey deare.<br>
Then shalt thou take him to thy loued fere,<br>
And ioyne in equall portion of thy realme:<br>
And afterwards a sonne to him shalt beare,<br>
That Lion-like shall shew his powre extreame.<br>
So blesse thee God, and giue thee ioyance of thy dreame<p>

All which when she vnto the end had heard,<br>
She much was eased in her troublous thought,<br>
And on those Priests bestowed rich reward:<br>
And royall gifts of gold and siluer wrought,<br>
She for a present to their Goddesse brought.<br>
Then taking leaue of them, she forward went,<br>
To seeke her loue, where he was to be sought;<br>
Ne rested till she cam without relent<br>
Vnto the land of Amazons, as she was bent.<p>

Whereof when newes to <i>Radigund</i> was brought,<br>
Not with amaze, as women wonted bee,<br>
She was confused in her troublous thought,<br>
But fild with courage and with ioyous glee,<br>
As glad to heare of armes, the which now she<br>
Had long surceast, she bad to open bold,<br>
That she the face of her new foe might see.<br>
But when they of that yron man had told,<br>
Which late her folke had slaine, she bad th&#7869; forth to hold.<p>

So there without the gate (as seemed best)<br>
She caused her Pauilion be pight;<br>
In which stout <i>Britomart</i> her selfe did rest,<br>
Whiles <i>Talus</i> watched at the dore all night.<br>
All night likewise, they of the towne in fright,<br>
Vppon their wall good watch and ward did keepe.<br>
The morrow next, so soone as dawning light<br>
Bad doe away the dampe of drouzie sleepe,<br>
The warlike Amazon out of her bowre did peepe.<p>

And caused streight a Trumpet loud to shrill,<br>
To warne her foe to battell soone be prest:<br>
Who long before awoke (for she ful ill<br>
Could sleepe all night, that in vnquiet brest<br>
Did closely harbour such a iealous guest)<br>
Was to the battell whilome ready dight.<br>
Eftsoones that warriouresse with haughty crest<br>
Did forth issue, all ready for the fight:<br>
On th'other side her foe appeared soone in sight.<p>

But ere they reared hand, the Amazone<br>
Began the streight conditions to propound,<br>
With which she vsed still to tye her fone;<br>
To serue her so, as she the rest had bound.<br>
Which when the other heard, she sternly frownd<br>
For high disdaine of such indignity,<br>
And would no lenger treat, but bad them sound.<br>
For her no other termes should euer tie<br>
Then what prescribed were by lawes of cheualrie.<p>

The Trumpets sound, and they together run<br>
With greedy rage, and with their faulchins smot;<br>
Ne either sought the others strokes to shun,<br>
But through great fury both their skill forgot,<br>
And practicke vse in armes: ne spared not<br>
Their dainty parts, which nature had created<br>
So faire and tender, without staine or spot,<br>
For other vses, then they them translated;<br>
Which they now hackt &amp; hewd, as if such vse they hated,<p>

As when a Tygre and a Lionesse<br>
Are met at spoyling of some hungry pray,<br>
Both challenge it with equall greedinesse:<br>
But first the Tygre clawes thereon did lay;<br>
And therefore loth to loose her right away,<br>
Doth in defence thereof full stoutly stond:<br>
To which the Lion strongly doth gainesay,<br>
That she to hunt the beast first tooke in hond;<br>
And therefore ought it haue, where euer she it fond.<p>

Full fiercely layde the Amazon about,<br>
And dealt her blowes vnmercifully sore:<br>
Which <i>Britomart</i> withstood with courage stout,<br>
And them repaide againe with double more.<br>
So long they fought, that all the grassie flore<br>
Was fild with bloud, which from their sides did flow,<br>
And gushed through their armes, that all in gore<br>
They trode, and on the ground their liues did strow,<br>
Like fruitles seede, of which vntimely death should grow.<p>

At last proud <i>Radigund</i> with fell despight,<br>
Hauing by chaunce espide aduantage neare,<br>
Let driue at her with all her dreadfull might,<br>
And thus vpbrayding sayd; This token beare<br>
Vnto the man, whom thou doest loue so deare;<br>
And tell him for his sake thy life thou gauest.<br>
Which spitefull words she sore engrieu'd to heare,<br>
Thus answer'd; Lewdly thou my loue deprauest,<br>
Who shortly must repent that now so vainely brauest.<p>

Nath'lesse that stroke so cruell passage found,<br>
That glauncing on her shoulder plate, it bit<br>
Vnto the bone, and made a griesly wound,<br>
That she her shield through raging smart of it<br>
Could scarse vphold; yet soone she it requit.<br>
For hauing force increast through furious paine,<br>
She her so rudely on the helmet smit,<br>
That it empierced to the very braine,<br>
And her proud person low prostrated on the plaine.<p>

Where being layd, the wrothfull Britonesse<br>
Stayd not, till she came to her selfe againe,<br>
But in reuenge both of her loues distresse,<br>
And her late vile reproch, though vaunted vaine,<br>
And also of her wound, which sore did paine,<br>
She with one stroke both head and helmet cleft.<br>
Which dreadfull sight, when all her warlike traine<br>
There present saw, each one of sence bereft,<br>
Fled fast into the towne, and her sole victor left.<p>

But yet so fast they could not home retrate,<br>
But that swift <i>Talus</i> did the formost win;<br>
And pressing through the preace vnto the gate,<br>
Pelmell with them attonce did enter in.<br>
There then a piteous slaughter did begin:<br>
For all that euer came within his reach,<br>
He with his yron flale did thresh so thin,<br>
That he no worke at all left for the leach:<br>
Like to an hideous storme, which nothing may empeach.<p>

And now by this the noble Conqueresse<br>
Her selfe came in, her glory to partake;<br>
Where though reuengefull vow she did professe,<br>
Yet when she saw the heapes, which he did make,<br>
Of slaughtred carkasses, her heart did quake<br>
For very ruth, which did it almost riue,<br>
That she his fury willed him to slake:<br>
For else he sure had left not one aliue,<br>
But all in his reuenge of spirite would depriue.<p>

Tho when she had his execution stayd,<br>
She for that yron prison did enquire,<br>
In which her wretched loue was captiue layd:<br>
Which breaking open with indignant ire,<br>
She entred into all the partes entire.<br>
Where when she saw that lothly vncouth sight,<br>
Of men disguiz'd in womanishe attire,<br>
Her heart gan grudge, for very deepe despight<br>
Of so vnmanly maske, in misery misdight.<p>

At last when as to her owne Loue she came,<br>
Whom like disguize no lesse deformed had,<br>
At sight thereof abasht with secrete shame,<br>
She turnd her head aside, as nothing glad,<br>
To haue beheld a spectacle so bad:<br>
And then too well beleeu'd, that which tofore<br>
Iealous suspect as true vntruely drad,<br>
Which vaine conceipt now nourishing no more,<br>
She sought with ruth to salue his sad misfortunes sore.<p>

Not so great wonder and astonishment,<br>
Did the most chast <i>Penelope</i> possesse,<br>
To see her Lord, that was reported drent,<br>
And dead long since in dolorous distresse,<br>
Come home to her in piteous wretchednesse,<br>
After long trauell of full twenty yeares,<br>
That she knew not his fauours likelynesse,<br>
For many scarres and many hoary heares,<br>
But stood long staring on him, mongst vncertaine feares.<p>

Ah my deare Lord, what sight is this (quoth she)<br>
What May-game hath misfortune made of you?<br>
Where is that dreadfull manly looke? where be<br>
Those mighty palmes, the which ye wont t'embrew<br>
In bloud of Kings, and great hoastes to subdew?<br>
Could ought on earth so wondrous change haue wrought,<br>
As to haue robde you of that manly hew?<br>
Could so great courage stouped haue to ought?<br>
Then farewell fleshly force; I see thy pride is nought.<p>

Thenceforth she streight into a bowre him brought,<br>
And causd him those vncomely weedes vndight;<br>
And in their steede for other rayment sought,<br>
Whereof there was great store, and armors bright,<br>
Which had bene reft from many a noble Knight;<br>
Whom that proud Amazon subdewed had,<br>
Whilest Fortune fauourd her successe in fight,<br>
In which when as she him anew had clad,<br>
She was reuiu'd, and ioyd much in his semblance glad.<p>

So there a while they afterwards remained,<br>
Him to refresh, and her late wounds to heale:<br>
During which space she there as Princess rained,<br>
And changing all that forme of common weale,<br>
The liberty of women did repeale,<br>
Which they had long vsurpt; and them restoring<br>
To mens subiection, did true Iustice deale:<br>
That all they as a Goddesse her adoring,<br>
Her wisedome did admire, and hearkned to her loring.<p>

For all those Knights, which long in captiue shade<br>
Had shrowded bene, she did from thraldome free;<br>
And magistrates of all that city made,<br>
And gaue to them great liuing and large fee:<br>
And that they should for euer faithfull bee,<br>
Made them sweare fealty to <i>Artegall</i>.<br>
Who when him selfe now well recur'd did see,<br>
He purposd to proceed, what so be fall,<br>
Vppon his first aduenture, which him forth did call.<p>

Full sad and sorrowfull was <i>Britomart</i><br>
For his departure, her new cause of griefe;<br>
Yet wisely moderated her owne smart,<br>
Seeing his honor, which she tendred chiefe,<br>
Consisted much in that aduentures priefe.<br>
The care whereof, and hope of his successe<br>
Gaue vnto her great comfort and reliefe,<br>
That womanish complaints she did represse,<br>
And tempred for the time her present heauinesse.<p>

There she continu'd for a certaine space,<br>
Till through his want her woe did more increase:<br>
Then hoping that the change of aire and place<br>
Would change her paine, and sorrow somewhat ease,<br>
She parted thence, her anguish to appease.<br>
Meane while her noble Lord sir <i>Artegall</i><br>
Went on his way, ne euer howre did cease,<br>
Till he redeemed had that Lady thrall:<br>
That for another Canto will more fitly fall.<p>
