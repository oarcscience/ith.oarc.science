<blockquote>
<i>Turpine is baffuld, his two knights<br>
doe gaine their treasons meed;<br>
Fayre Mirabellaes punishment<br>
for loues disdaine decreed.</i><p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
L
Ike as the gentle hart it selfe bewrayes,<br>
In doing gentle deedes with franke delight,<br>
Euen so the baser mind it selfe displayes,<br>
In cancred malice and reuengefull spright.<br>
For to maligne, t'enuie, t'vse shifting slight,<br>
Be arguments of a vile donghill mind;<br>
Which what it dare not doe by open might,<br>
To worke by wicked treason wayes doth find,<br>
By such discourteous deeds discouering his base kind.<p>

That well appeares in this discourteous knight,<br>
The coward <i>Turpine</i>, whereof now I treat;<br>
Who notwithstanding that in former fight<br>
He of the Prince his life receiued late,<br>
Yet in his mind malitious and ingrate<br>
He gan deuize, to be aueng'd anew<br>
For all that shame, which kindled inward hate.<br>
Therefore so soone as he was out of vew,<br>
Himselfe in hast he arm'd, and did him fast pursew.<p>

Well did he tract his steps, as he did ryde,<br>
Yet would not neare approch in daungers eye,<br>
But kept aloofe for dread to be descryde,<br>
Vntill fit time and place he mote espy,<br>
Where he mote worke him scath and villeny.<br>
At last he met two knights to him vnknowne,<br>
The which were armed both agreeably,<br>
And both combynd, what euer chaunce were blowne,<br>
Betwixt them to diuide, and each to make his owne.<p>

To whom false <i>Turpine</i> comming courteously,<br>
To cloke the mischiefe, which he inly ment,<br>
Gan to complaine of great discourtesie,<br>
Which a straunge knight, that neare afore him went,<br>
Had doen to him, and his deare Ladie shent:<br>
Which if they would afford him ayde at need<br>
For to auenge, in time conuenient,<br>
They should accomplish both a knightly deed,<br>
And for their paines obtaine of him a goodly meed.<p>

The knights beleeu'd, that all he sayd, was trew,<br>
And being fresh and full of youthly spright,<br>
Were glad to heare of that aduenture new,<br>
In which they mote make triall of their might,<br>
Which neuer yet they had approu'd in fight;<br>
And eke desirous of the offred meed,<br>
Said then the one of them; Where is that wight,<br>
The which hath doen to thee this wrongfull deed,<br>
That we may it auenge, and punish him with speed?<p>

He rides (said <i>Turpine</i>) there not farre afore,<br>
With a wyld man soft footing by his syde,<br>
That if ye list to haste a litle more,<br>
Ye may him ouertake in timely tyde:<br>
Eftsoones they pricked forth with forward pryde,<br>
And ere that litle while they ridden had,<br>
The gentle Prince not farre away they spyde,<br>
Ryding a softly pace with portance sad,<br>
Deuizing of his loue more, then of daunger drad.<p>

Then one of them aloud vnto him cryde,<br>
Bidding him turne againe, false traytour knight,<br>
Foule womanwronger, for he him defyde.<br>
With that they both at once with equall spight<br>
Did bend their speares, and both with equall might<br>
Against him ran; but th'one did misse his marke,<br>
And being carried with his force forthright,<br>
Glaunst swiftly by; like to that heauenly sparke,<br>
Which glyding through the ayre lights all the heauens darke.<p>

But th'other ayming better, did him smite<br>
Full in the shield, with so impetuous powre,<br>
That all his launce in peeces shiuered quite,<br>
And scattered all about, fell on the flowre.<br>
But the stout Prince, with much more steddy stowre<br>
Full on his beuer did him strike so sore,<br>
That the cold steele through piercing, did deuowre<br>
His vitall breath, and to the ground him bore,<br>
Where still he bathed lay in his owne bloody gore.<p>

As when a cast of Faulcons make their flight<br>
At an Herneshaw, that lyes aloft on wing,<br>
The whyles they strike at him with heedlesse might,<br>
The warie foule his bill doth backward wring;<br>
On which the first, whose force her first doth bring,<br>
Her selfe quite through the bodie doth engore,<br>
And falleth downe to ground like senselesse thing,<br>
But th'other not so swift, as she before,<br>
Fayles of her souse, and passing by doth hurt no more.<p>

By this the other, which was passed by,<br>
Himselfe recouering, was return'd to fight;<br>
Where when he saw his fellow lifelesse ly,<br>
He much was daunted with so dismall sight;<br>
Yet nought abating of his former spight,<br>
Let driue at him with so malitious mynd,<br>
As if he would haue passed through him quight:<br>
But the steele-head no stedfast hold could fynd,<br>
But glauncing by, deceiu'd him of that he desynd.<p>

Not so the Prince: for his well learned speare<br>
Tooke surer hould, and from his horses backe<br>
Aboue a launces length him forth did beare,<br>
And gainst the cold hard earth so sore him strake,<br>
That all his bones in peeces nigh he brake.<br>
Where seeing him so lie, he left his steed,<br>
And to him leaping, vengeance thought to take<br>
Of him, for all his former follies meed,<br>
With flaming sword in hand his terror more to breed.<p>

The fearefull swayne beholding death so nie,<br>
Cryde out aloud for mercie him to saue;<br>
In lieu whereof he would to him descrie,<br>
Great treason to him meant, his life to reaue.<br>
The Prince soone hearkned, and his life forgaue.<br>
Then thus said he,  There is a straunger knight,<br>
The which for promise of great meed, vs draue<br>
To this attempt, to wreake his hid despight,<br>
For that himselfe thereto did want sufficient might.<p>

The Prince much mused at such villenie,<br>
And sayd; Now sure ye well haue earn'd your meed,<br>
For th'one is dead, and th'other soone shall die,<br>
Vnlesse to me thou hether bring with speed<br>
The wretch, that hyr'd you to this wicked deed.<br>
He glad of life, and willing eke to wreake<br>
The guilt on him, which did this mischiefe breed,<br>
Swore by his sword, that neither day nor weeke<br>
He would surceasse, but him, where so he were, would seeke.<p>

So vp he rose, and forth streight way he went<br>
Backe to the place, where <i>Turpine</i> late he lore;<br>
There he him found in great astonishment,<br>
To see him so bedight with bloodie gore,<br>
And griesly wounds that him appalled sore.<br>
Yet thus at length he said, How now Sir Knight?<br>
What meaneth this, which here I see before?<br>
How fortuneth this foule vncomely plight,<br>
So different from that, which earst ye seem'd in sight?<p>

Perdie (said he) in euill houre it fell,<br>
That euer I for meed did vndertake<br>
So hard a taske, as life for hyre to sell;<br>
The which I earst aduentur'd for your sake.<br>
Witnesse the wounds, and this wyde bloudie lake,<br>
Which ye may see yet all about me steeme.<br>
Therefore now yeeld, as ye did promise make,<br>
My due reward, the which right well I deeme<br>
I yearned haue, that life so dearely did redeeme.<p>

But where then is (quoth he halfe wrothfully)<br>
Where is the bootie, which therefore I bought,<br>
That cursed caytiue, my strong enemy,<br>
That recreant knight, whose hated life I sought?<br>
And where is eke your friend, which halfe it ought?<br>
He lyes (said he) vpon the cold bare ground,<br>
Slayne of that errant knight, with whom he fought;<br>
Whom afterwards my selfe with many a wound<br>
Did slay againe, as ye may see there in the stound.<p>

Thereof false <i>Turpin</i> was full glad and faine,<br>
And needs with him streight to the place would ryde,<br>
Where he himselfe might see his foeman slaine;<br>
For else his feare could not be satisfyde.<br>
So as they rode, he saw the way all dyde<br>
With streames of bloud; which tracting by the traile,<br>
Ere long they came, whereas in euill tyde<br>
That other swayne, like ashes deadly pale,<br>
Lay in the lap of death, rewing his wretched bale.<p>

Much did the Crauen seeme to mone his case,<br>
That for his sake his deare life had forgone;<br>
And him bewayling with affection base,<br>
Did counterfeit kind pittie, where was none:<br>
For wheres no courage, theres no ruth nor mone.<br>
Thence passing forth, not farre away he found,<br>
Whereas the Prince himselfe lay all alone,<br>
Loosely displayd vpon the grassie ground,<br>
Possessed of sweete sleepe, that luld him soft in swound.<p>

Wearie of trauell in his former fight,<br>
He there in shade himselfe had layd to rest,<br>
Hauing his armes and warlike things vndight,<br>
Fearelesse of foes that mote his peace molest;<br>
The whyles his saluage page, that wont be prest,<br>
Was wandred in the wood another way,<br>
To doe some thing, that seemed to him best,<br>
The whyles his Lord in siluer slomber lay,<br>
Like to the Euening starre adorn'd with deawy ray.<p>

Whom when as <i>Turpin</i> saw so loosely layd,<br>
He weened well, that he in deed was dead,<br>
Like as that other knight to him had sayd:<br>
But when he nigh approcht, he mote aread<br>
Plaine signes in him of life and liuelihead.<br>
Whereat much grieu'd against that straunger knight,<br>
That him too light of credence did mislead,<br>
He would haue backe retyred from that sight,<br>
That was to him on earth the deadliest despight.<p>

But that same knight would not once let him start,<br>
But plainely gan to him declare the case<br>
Of all his mischiefe, and late lucklesse smart;<br>
How both he and his fellow there in place<br>
Were vanquished, and put to foule disgrace,<br>
And how that he in lieu of life him lent,<br>
Had vow'd vnto the victor, him to trace<br>
And follow through the world, where so he went,<br>
Till that he him deliuered to his punishment.<p>

He therewith much abashed and affrayd,<br>
Began to tremble euery limbe and vaine;<br>
And softly whispering him, entyrely prayd,<br>
T'aduize him better, then by such a traine<br>
Him to betray vnto a straunger swaine:<br>
Yet rather counseld him contrarywize,<br>
Sith he likewise did wrong by him sustaine,<br>
To ioyne with him and vengeance to deuize,<br>
Whylest time did offer meanes him sleeping to surprize.<p>

Nathelesse for all his speach, the gentle knight<br>
Would not be tempted to such villenie,<br>
Regarding more his faith, which he did plight,<br>
All were it to his mortall enemie,<br>
Then to entrap him by false treacherie:<br>
Great shame in lieges blood to be embrew'd.<br>
Thus whylest they were debating diuerslie,<br>
The Saluage forth out of the wood issew'd<br>
Backe to the place, whereas his Lord he sleeping vew'd.<p>

There when he saw those two so neare him stand,<br>
He doubted much what mote their meaning bee,<br>
And throwing downe his load out of his hand,<br>
To weet great store of forrest frute, which hee<br>
Had for his food late gathered from the tree,<br>
Himselfe vnto his weapon he betooke,<br>
That was an oaken plant, which lately hee<br>
Rent by the root; which he so sternely shooke,<br>
That like an hazell wand, it quiuered and quooke.<p>

Whereat the Prince awaking, when he spyde<br>
The traytour <i>Turpin</i> with that other knight,<br>
He started vp, and snatching neare his syde<br>
His trustie sword, the seruant of his might,<br>
Like a fell Lyon leaped to him light,<br>
And his left hand vpon his collar layd.<br>
Therewith the cowheard deaded with affright,<br>
Fell flat to ground, ne word vnto him sayd,<br>
But holding vp his hands, with silence mercie prayd.<p>

But he so full of indignation was,<br>
That to his prayer nought he would incline,<br>
But as he lay vpon the humbled gras,<br>
His foot he set on his vile necke, in signe<br>
Of seruile yoke, that nobler harts repine.<br>
Then letting him arise like abiect thrall,<br>
He gan to him obiect his haynous crime,<br>
And to reuile, and rate, and recreant call,<br>
And lastly to despoyle of knightly bannerall.<p>

And after all, for greater infamie,<br>
He by the heeles him hung vpon a tree,<br>
And baffuld so, that all which passed by,<br>
The picture of his punishment might see,<br>
And by the like ensample warned bee,<br>
How euer they through treason doe trespasse.<br>
But turne we now backe to that Ladie free,<br>1
Whom late we left ryding vpon an Asse,<br>
Led by a Carle and foole, which by her side did passe.<p>

She was a Ladie of great dignitie,<br>
And lifted vp to honorable place,<br>
Famous through all the land of Faerie,<br>
Though of meane parentage and kindred base,<br>
Yet deckt with wondrous giftes of natures grace,<br>
That all men did her person much admire,<br>
And praise the feature of her goodly face,<br>
The beames whereof did kindle louely fire<br>
In th'harts of many a knight, and many a gentle squire.<p>

But she thereof grew proud and insolent,<br>
That none she worthie thought to be her fere,<br>
But scornd them all, that loue vnto her ment:<br>
Yet was she lou'd of many a worthy pere;<br>
Vnworthy she to be belou'd so dere,<br>
That could not weigh of worthinesse aright.<br>
For beautie is more glorious bright and clere,<br>
The more it is admir'd of many a wight,<br>
And noblest she, that serued is of noblest knight.<p>

But this coy Damzell thought contrariwize,<br>
That such proud looks would make her praysed more;<br>
And that the more she did all loue despize,<br>
The more would wretched louers her adore.<br>
What cared she, who sighed for her sore,<br>
Or who did wayle or watch the wearie night?<br>
Let them that list, their lucklesse lot deplore;<br>
She was borne free, not bound to any wight,<br>
And so would euer liue, and loue her owne delight.<p>

Through such her stubborne stifnesse, and hard hart,<br>
Many a wretch, for want of remedie,<br>
Did languish long in lifeconsuming smart,<br>
And at the last through dreary dolour die:<br>
Whylest she, the Ladie of her libertie,<br>
Did boast her beautie had such soueraine might,<br>
That with the onely twinckle of her eye,<br>
She could or saue, or spill, whom she would hight.<br>
What could the Gods doe more, but doe it more aright?<p>

But loe the Gods, that mortall follies vew,<br>
Did worthily reuenge this maydens pride;<br>
And nought regarding her so goodly hew,<br>
Did laugh at her, that many did deride,<br>
Whilest she did weepe, of no man mercifide.<br>
For on a day, when <i>Cupid</i> kept his court,<br>
As he is wont at each Saint Valentide,<br>
Vnto the which all louers doe resort,<br>
That of their loues successe they there may make report.<p>

It fortun'd then, that when the roules were red,<br>
In wich the names of all loues folke were fyled,<br>
That many there were missing, which were ded,<br>
Or kept in bands, or from their loues exyled,<br>
Or by some other violence despoyled.<br>
Which when as <i>Cupid</i> heard, he wexed wroth,<br>
And doubting to be wronged, or beguyled,<br>
He bad his eyes to be vnblindfold both,<br>
That he might see his men, and muster them by oth.<p>

Then found he many missing of his crew,<br>
Which wont doe suit and seruice to his might;<br>
Of whom what was becomen, no man knew.<br>
Therefore a Iurie was impaneld streight,<br>
T'enquire of them, whether by force, or sleight,<br>
Or their owne guilt, they were away conuayd.<br>
To whom foule <i>Infamie</i>, and fell <i>Despight</i><br>
Gaue euidence, that they were all betrayd,<br>
And murdred cruelly by a rebellious Mayd.<p>

Fayre <i>Mirabella</i> was her name, whereby<br>
Of all those crymes she there indited was:<br>
All which when <i>Cupid</i> heard, he by and by<br>
In great displeasure, wild a <i>Capias</i><br>
Should issue forth, t'attach that scornefull lasse.<br>
The warrant straight was made, and therewithall<br>
A Baylieffe errant forth in post did passe,<br>
Whom they by name there <i>Portamore</i> did call;<br>
He which doth summon louers to Loues iudgement hall.<p>

The damzell was attacht, and shortly brought<br>
Vnto the barre, whereas she was arrayned:<br>
But she thereto nould plead, nor answere ought<br>
Euen for stubborne pride, which her restrayned.<br>
So iudgement past, as is by law ordayned<br>
In cases like, which when at last she saw,<br>
Her stubborne hart, which loue before disdayned,<br>
Gan stoupe, and falling downe with humble awe,<br>
Cryde mercie, to abate the extremitie of law.<p>

The sonne of <i>Venus</i> who is myld by kynd,<br>
But where he is prouokt with peeuishnesse,<br>
Vnto her prayers piteously enclynd,<br>
And did the rigour of his doome represse;<br>
Yet not so freely, but that nathelesse<br>
He vnto her a penance did impose:<br>
Which was, that through this worlds wyde wildernes<br>
She wander should in companie of those,<br>
Till she had sau'd so many loues, as she did lose.<p>

So now she had bene wandring two whole yeares<br>
Throughout the world, in this vncomely case,<br>
Wasting her goodly hew in heauie teares,<br>
And her good dayes in dolorous disgrace:<br>
Yet had she not in all these two yeares space,<br>
Saued but two, yet in two yeares before,<br>
Through her dispiteous pride, whilest loue lackt place,<br>
She had destroyed two and twenty more.<br>
Aie me, how could her loue make half amends therefore.<p>

And now she was vppon the weary way,<br>
When as the gentle Squire, with faire <i>Serene</i>,<br>
Met her in such misseeming foule array;<br>
The whiles that mighty man did her demeane<br>
With all the euill termes and cruell meane,<br>
That he could make; And eeke that angry foole<br>
Which follow'd her, with cursed hands vncleane<br>
Whipping her horse, did with his smarting toole<br>
Oft whip her dainty selfe, and much augment her doole.<p>

Ne ought it mote auaile her to entreat<br>
The one or th'other, better her to vse:<br>
For both so wilfull were and obstinate,<br>
That all her piteous plaint they did refuse,<br>
And rather did the more her beate and bruse.<br>
But most the former villaine, which did lead<br>
Her tyreling iade, was bent her to abuse;<br>
Who though she were with wearinesse nigh dead,<br>
Yet would not let her lite, nor rest a little stead.<p>

For he was sterne, and terrible by nature,<br>
And eeke of person huge and hideous,<br>
Exceeding much the measure of mans stature,<br>
And rather like a Gyant monstruous.<br>
For sooth he was descended of the hous<br>
Of those old Gyants, which did warres darraine<br>
Against the heauen in order battailous,<br>
And sib to great <i>Orgolio</i>, which was slaine<br>
By <i>Arthure</i>, when as <i>Vnas</i> Knight he did maintaine.<p>

His lookes were dreadfull, and his fiery eies<br>
Like two great Beacons, glared bright and wyde,<br>
Glauncing askew, as if his enemies<br>
He scorned in his ouerweening pryde;<br>
And stalking stately like a Crane, did stryde<br>
At euery step vppon the tiptoes hie,<br>
And all the way he went, on euery syde<br>
He gaz'd about, and stared horriblie,<br>
As if he with his lookes would all men terrifie.<p>

He wore no armour, ne for none did care,<br>
As no whit dreading any liuing wight;<br>
But in a Iacket quilted richly rare,<br>
Vpon checklaton he was straungely dight,<br>
And on his head a roll of linnen plight,<br>
Like to the Mores of Malaber he wore;<br>
With which his locks, as blacke as pitchy night,<br>
Were bound about, and voyded from before,<br>
And in his hand a mighty yron club he bore.<p>

This was <i>Disdaine</i>, who led that Ladies horse<br>
Through thick and thin, through mountains &amp; through plains,<br>
Compelling her, wher she would not, by force,<br>
Haling her palfrey by the hempen raines.<br>
But that same foole, which most increast her paines,<br>
Was <i>Scorne</i>, who hauing in his hand a whip,<br>
Her therewith yirks, and still when she complaines,<br>
The more he laughes, and does her closely quip,<br>
To see her sore lament, and bite her tender lip.<p>

Whose cruell handling when that Squire beheld,<br>
And saw those villaines her so vildely vse,<br>
His gentle heart with indignation sweld,<br>
And could no lenger beare so great abuse,<br>
As such a Lady so to beate and bruse;<br>
But to him stepping, such a stroke him lent,<br>
That forst him th'halter from his hand to loose,<br>
And maugre all his might, backe to relent:<br>
Else had he surely there bene slaine, or fowlyshent.<p>

The villaine, wroth for greeting him so sore,<br>
Gathered him selfe together soone againe,<br>
And with his yron batton, which he bore,<br>
Let driue at him so dreadfully amaine,<br>
That for his safety he did him constraine<br>
To giue him ground, and shift to euery side,<br>
Rather then once his burden to sustaine:<br>
For bootelesse thing him seemed, to abide<br>
So mighty blowes, or proue the puissaunce of his pride.<p>

Like as a Mastiffe hauing at a bay<br>
A saluage Bull, whose cruell hornes doe threat<br>
Desperate daunger, if he them assay,<br>
Traceth his ground, and round about doth beat,<br>
To spy where he may some aduauntage get;<br>
The whiles the beast doth rage and loudly rore,<br>
So did the Squire, the whiles the Carle did fret,<br>
And fume in his disdainefull mynd the more,<br>
And oftentimes by Turmagant and Mahound swore.<p>

Nathelesse so sharpely still he him pursewd,<br>
That at aduantage him at last he tooke,<br>
When his foote slipt (that slip he dearely rewd,)<br>
And with his yron club to ground him strooke;<br>
Where still he lay, ne out of swoune awooke,<br>
Till heauy hand the Carle vpon him layd,<br>
And bound him fast: Tho when he vp did looke,<br>
And saw him selfe captiu'd, he was dismayd,<br>
Ne powre had to withstand, ne hope of any ayd.<p>

Then vp he made him rise, and forward fare,<br>
Led in a rope, which both his hands did bynd;<br>
Ne ought that foole for pitty did him spare,<br>
But with his whip him following behynd,<br>
Him often scourg'd, and forst his feete to fynd:<br>
And other whiles with bitter mockes and mowes<br>
He would him scorne, that to his gentle mynd<br>
Was much more grieuous, then the others blowes:<br>
Words sharpely wound, but greatest griefe of scorning growes.<p>

The faire <i>Serena</i>, when she saw him fall<br>
Vnder that villaines club, then surely thought<br>
That slaine he was, or made a wretched thrall,<br>
And fled away with all the speede she mought,<br>
To seeke for safety, which long time she sought:<br>
And past through many perils by the way,<br>
Ere she againe to <i>Calepine</i> was brought;<br>
The which discourse as now I must delay,<br>
Till <i>Mirabellaes</i> fortunes I doe further say.<p>
