#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Parson's Tale

<span id="an_75"></span> Oure sweete Lord God of hevene, that no man
wole perisse but wole that  
<span id="an_75A"></span> we comen alle to the knoweleche of hym and to
the blisful lif that is perdurable,  
<span id="an_76"></span> amonesteth us by the prophete Jeremie, that
seith in thys wyse:  
<span id="an_77"></span> "Stondeth upon the weyes, and seeth and axeth
of olde pathes (that is to seyn, of olde sentences) which is the goode
wey,  
<span id="an_78"></span> and walketh in that wey, and ye shal fynde
refresshynge for youre soules, etc."  
<span id="an_79"></span> Manye been the weyes espirituels that leden
folk to oure Lord Jhesu Crist and to the regne of glorie.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> Of whiche weyes
ther is a ful noble wey and a ful covenable, which may nat fayle to man
ne to womman  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80A">80A</span></span> that thurgh
synne hath mysgoon fro the righte wey of Jerusalem celestial;  
<span id="an_81"></span> and this wey is cleped Penitence, of which man
sholde gladly herknen and enquere with al his herte  
<span id="an_82"></span> to wyten what is Penitence, and whennes it is
cleped Penitence, and in how manye maneres been the acciouns or
werkynges of Penitence,  
<span id="an_83"></span> and how manye speces ther been of Penitence,
and whiche thynges apertenen and bihoven to Penitence, and whiche
thynges destourben Penitence.  
<span id="an_84"></span> Seint Ambrose seith that Penitence is the
pleynynge of man for the gilt that he hath doon,  
<span id="an_84A"></span> and namoore to do any thyng for which hym
oghte to pleyne.  
<span id="an_85"></span> And som doctour seith, "Penitence is the
waymentynge of man that sorweth for his synne and pyneth hymself for he
hath mysdoon."  
<span id="an_86"></span> Penitence, with certeyne circumstances, is
verray repentance of a man that halt hymself in sorwe and oother peyne
for his giltes.  
<span id="an_87"></span> And for he shal be verray penitent, he shal
first biwaylen the synnes that he hath doon,  
<span id="an_87A"></span> and stidefastly purposen in his herte to have
shrift of mouthe, and to doon satisfaccioun,  
<span id="an_88"></span> and nevere to doon thyng for which hym oghte
moore to biwayle  
<span id="an_88A"></span> or to compleyne, and to continue in goode
werkes, or elles his repentance may nat availle.  
<span id="an_89"></span> For, as seith Seint Ysidre,  
<span id="an_89A"></span> "He is a japere and a gabbere and no verray
repentant that eftsoone dooth thyng for which hym oghte repente."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> Wepynge, and
nat for to stynte to do synne, may nat avayle.  
<span id="an_91"></span> But nathelees, men shal hope that every tyme
that man falleth, be it never so ofte,  
<span id="an_91A"></span> that he may arise thurgh Penitence, if he have
grace; but certeinly it is greet doute.  
<span id="an_92"></span> For, as seith Seint Gregorie, "Unnethe ariseth
he out of his synne, that is charged with the charge of yvel usage."  
<span id="an_93"></span> And therfore repentant folk, that stynte for to
synne and forlete synne er that synne forlete hem,  
<span id="an_93A"></span> hooly chirche holdeth hem siker of hire
savacioun.  
<span id="an_94"></span> And he that synneth and verraily repenteth hym
in his laste, hooly chirche yet hopeth his savacioun,  
<span id="an_94A"></span> by the grete mercy of oure Lord Jhesu Crist,
for his repentaunce; but taak the siker wey.  
<span id="an_95"></span> And now, sith I have declared yow what thyng is
Penitence, now shul ye understonde that ther been three acciouns of
Penitence.  
<span id="an_96"></span> The firste is that if a man be baptized after
that he hath synned.  
<span id="an_97"></span> Seint Augustyn seith, "But he be penytent for
his olde synful lyf, he may nat bigynne the newe clene lif."  
<span id="an_98"></span> For, certes, if he be baptized withouten
penitence of his olde gilt, he receyveth the mark of baptesme  
<span id="an_98A"></span> but nat the grace ne the remission of his
synnes, til he have repentance verray.  
<span id="an_99"></span> Another defaute is this: that men doon deedly
synne after that they han receyved baptesme.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> The thridde
defaute is that men fallen in venial synnes after hir baptesme fro day
to day.  
<span id="an_101"></span> Therof seith Seint Augustyn that penitence of
goode and humble folk is the penitence of every day.  
<span id="an_102"></span> The speces of Penitence been three. That oon
of hem is solempne, another is commune, and the thridde is privee.  
<span id="an_103"></span> Thilke penance that is solempne is in two
maneres;  
<span id="an_103A"></span> as to be put out of hooly chirche in Lente
for slaughtre of children, and swich maner thyng.  
<span id="an_104"></span> Another is, whan a man hath synned openly, of
which synne the fame is openly spoken in the contree,  
<span id="an_104A"></span> and thanne hooly chirche by juggement
destreyneth hym for to do open penaunce.  
<span id="an_105"></span> Commune penaunce is that preestes enjoynen men
communly in certeyn caas, as for to goon peraventure naked in
pilgrimages, or barefoot.  
<span id="an_106"></span> Pryvee penaunce is thilke that men doon alday
for privee synnes, of whiche we shryve us prively and receyve privee
penaunce.  
<span id="an_107"></span> Now shaltow understande what is bihovely and
necessarie to verray parfit Penitence. And this stant on three
thynges:  
<span id="an_108"></span> Contricioun of Herte, Confessioun of Mouth,
and Satisfaccioun.  
<span id="an_109"></span> For which seith Seint John Crisostom,
"Penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benygnely every peyne that hym
is enjoyned,  
<span id="an_109A"></span> with contricioun of herte, and shrift of
mouth, with satisfaccioun, and in werkynge of alle manere humylitee."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> And this is
fruytful penitence agayn three thynges in which we wratthe oure Lord
Jhesu Crist;  
<span id="an_111"></span> this is to seyn, by delit in thynkynge, by
reccheleesnesse in spekynge, and by wikked synful werkynge.  
<span id="an_112"></span> And agayns thise wikkede giltes is Penitence,
that may be likned unto a tree.  
<span id="an_113"></span> The roote of this tree is Contricioun, that
hideth hym in the herte of hym that is verray repentaunt,  
<span id="an_113A"></span> right as the roote of a tree hydeth hym in
the erthe.  
<span id="an_114"></span> Of the roote of Contricioun spryngeth a stalke
that bereth braunches and leves of Confessioun, and fruyt of
Satisfaccioun.  
<span id="an_115"></span> For which Crist seith in his gospel, "Dooth
digne fruyt of Penitence"; for by this fruyt may men knowe this tree,  
<span id="an_115A"></span> and nat by the roote that is hyd in the herte
of man, ne by the braunches, ne by the leves of Confessioun.  
<span id="an_116"></span> And therfore oure Lord Jhesu Crist seith thus:
"By the fruyt of hem shul ye knowen hem."  
<span id="an_117"></span> Of this roote eek spryngeth a seed of grace,
the which seed is mooder of sikernesse, and this seed is egre and
hoot.  
<span id="an_118"></span> The grace of this seed spryngeth of God thurgh
remembrance of the day of doom and on the peynes of helle.  
<span id="an_119"></span> Of this matere seith Salomon that in the drede
of God man forleteth his synne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> The heete of
this seed is the love of God and the desiryng of the joye perdurable.  
<span id="an_121"></span> This heete draweth the herte of a man to God
and dooth hym haten his synne.  
<span id="an_122"></span> For soothly ther is nothyng that savoureth so
wel to a child as the milk of his norice,  
<span id="an_122A"></span> ne nothyng is to hym moore abhomynable than
thilke milk whan it is medled with oother mete.  
<span id="an_123"></span> Right so the synful man that loveth his synne,
hym semeth that it is to him moost sweete of any thyng;  
<span id="an_124"></span> but fro that tyme that he loveth sadly oure
Lord Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_124A"></span> and desireth the lif perdurable, ther nys to
him no thyng moore abhomynable.  
<span id="an_125"></span> For soothly the lawe of God is the love of
God; for which David the prophete seith.  
<span id="an_125A"></span> "I have loved thy lawe and hated wikkednesse
and hate"; he that loveth God kepeth his lawe and his word.  
<span id="an_126"></span> This tree saugh the prophete Daniel in spirit,
upon the avysioun of the kyng Nabugodonosor, whan he conseiled hym to do
penitence.  
<span id="an_127"></span> Penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it
receyven,  
<span id="an_127A"></span> and he that holdeth hym in verray penitence
is blessed, after the sentence of Salomon.  
<span id="an_128"></span> In this Penitence or Contricioun man shal
understonde foure thynges; that is to seyn, what is Contricioun,  
<span id="an_128A"></span> and whiche been the causes that moeven a man
to Contricioun, and how he sholde be contrit, and what Contricioun
availleth to the soule.  
<span id="an_129"></span> Thanne is it thus: that Contricioun is the
verray sorwe that a man receyveth in his herte for his synnes,  
<span id="an_129A"></span> with sad purpos to shryve hym, and to do
penaunce, and neveremoore to do synne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> And this
sorwe shal been in this manere, as seith Seint Bernard:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130A">130A</span></span> "It shal
been hevy and grevous, and ful sharp and poynaunt in herte."  
<span id="an_131"></span> First, for man hath agilt his Lord and his
Creatour; and moore sharp and poynaunt for he hath agilt hys Fader
celestial;  
<span id="an_132"></span> and yet moore sharp and poynaunt for he hath
wrathed and agilt hym that boghte hym, that with his precious blood hath
delivered us  
<span id="an_132A"></span> fro the bondes of synne, and fro the crueltee
of the devel, and fro the peynes of helle.  
<span id="an_133"></span> The causes that oghte moeve a man to
Contricioun been sixe. First a man shal remembre hym of his synnes;  
<span id="an_134"></span> but looke he that thilke remembraunce ne be to
hym no delit by no wey, but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt.  
<span id="an_134A"></span> For Job seith, "Synful men doon werkes worthy
of confusioun."  
<span id="an_135"></span> And therfore seith Ezechie, "I wol remembre me
alle the yeres of my lyf in bitternesse of myn herte."  
<span id="an_136"></span> And God seith in the Apocalipse, "Remembreth
yow fro whennes that ye been falle";  
<span id="an_136A"></span> for biforn that tyme that ye synned, ye were
the children of God and lymes of the regne of God;  
<span id="an_137"></span> but for youre synne ye been woxen thral, and
foul, and membres of the feend, hate of aungels, sclaundre of hooly
chirche,  
<span id="an_137A"></span> and foode of the false serpent, perpetueel
matere of the fir of helle;  
<span id="an_138"></span> and yet moore foul and abhomynable, for ye
trespassen so ofte tyme as dooth the hound that retourneth to eten his
spewyng.  
<span id="an_139"></span> And yet be ye fouler for youre longe
continuyng in synne and youre synful usage,  
<span id="an_139A"></span> for which ye be roten in youre synne, as a
beest in his dong.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Swiche manere
of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his synne, and no delit, as God
seith by the prophete Ezechiel,  
<span id="an_141"></span> "Ye shal remembre yow of youre weyes, and they
shuln displese yow." Soothly synnes been the weyes that leden folk to
helle.  
<span id="an_142"></span> The seconde cause that oghte make a man to
have desdeyn of synne is this:  
<span id="an_142A"></span> that, as seith Seint Peter, "whoso that dooth
synne is thral of synne"; and synne put a man in greet thraldom.  
<span id="an_143"></span> And therfore seith the prophete Ezechiel: "I
wente sorweful in desdayn of myself."  
<span id="an_143A"></span> Certes, wel oghte a man have desdayn of synne
and withdrawe hym from that thraldom and vileynye.  
<span id="an_144"></span> And lo, what seith Seneca in this matere? He
seith thus: "Though I wiste that neither God ne man ne sholde nevere
knowe it,  
<span id="an_144A"></span> yet wolde I have desdayn for to do synne."  
<span id="an_145"></span> And the same Seneca also seith, "I am born to
gretter thynges than to be thral to my body,  
<span id="an_145A"></span> or than for to maken of my body a thral."  
<span id="an_146"></span> Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken
of his body than for to yeven his body to synne.  
<span id="an_147"></span> Al were it the fouleste cherl or the fouleste
womman that lyveth, and leest of value,  
<span id="an_147A"></span> yet is he thanne moore foul and moore in
servitute.  
<span id="an_148"></span> Evere fro the hyer degree that man falleth,
the moore is he thral, and moore to God and to the world vile and
abhomynable.  
<span id="an_149"></span> O goode God, wel oghte man have desdayn of
synne, sith that thurgh synne ther he was free now is he maked bonde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> And therfore
seyth Seint Augustyn: "If thou hast desdayn of thy servant,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150A">150A</span></span> if he
agilte or synne, have thou thanne desdayn that thou thyself sholdest do
synne."  
<span id="an_151"></span> Tak reward of thy value, that thou ne be to
foul to thyself.  
<span id="an_152"></span> Allas, wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to
been servauntz and thralles to synne, and soore been ashamed of
hemself  
<span id="an_153"></span> that God of his endelees goodnesse hath set
hem in heigh estaat, or yeven hem wit, strengthe of body, heele,
beautee, prosperitee,  
<span id="an_154"></span> and boghte hem fro the deeth with his
herte-blood,  
<span id="an_154A"></span> that they so unkyndely, agayns his
gentilesse, quiten hym so vileynsly to slaughtre of hir owene soules.  
<span id="an_155"></span> O goode God, ye wommen that been of so greet
beautee, remembreth yow of the proverbe of Salomon. He seith,  
<span id="an_156"></span> "Likneth a fair womman that is a fool of hire
body  
<span id="an_156A"></span> lyk to a ryng of gold that were in the groyn
of a soughe."  
<span id="an_157"></span> For right as a soughe wroteth in everich
ordure, so wroteth she hire beautee in the stynkynge ordure of synne.  
<span id="an_158"></span> The thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to
Contricioun is drede of the day of doom and of the horrible peynes of
helle.  
<span id="an_159"></span> For as Seint Jerome seith, "At every tyme that
me remembreth of the day of doom I quake;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> for whan I
ete or drynke, or what so that I do, evere semeth me that the trompe
sowneth in myn ere:  
<span id="an_161"></span> \`Riseth up, ye that been dede, and cometh to
the juggement.'"  
<span id="an_162"></span> O goode God, muchel oghte a man to drede swich
a juggement, "ther as we shullen been alle,"  
<span id="an_162A"></span> as Seint Poul seith, "biforn the seete of
oure Lord Jhesu Crist";  
<span id="an_163"></span> whereas he shal make a general congregacioun,
whereas no man may been absent.  
<span id="an_164"></span> For certes there availleth noon essoyne ne
excusacioun.  
<span id="an_165"></span> And nat oonly that oure defautes shullen be
jugged, but eek that alle oure werkes shullen openly be knowe.  
<span id="an_166"></span> And, as seith Seint Bernard, "Ther ne shal no
pledynge availle, ne no sleighte; we shullen yeven rekenynge of everich
ydel word."  
<span id="an_167"></span> Ther shul we han a juge that may nat been
deceyved ne corrupt. And why?  
<span id="an_167A"></span> For, certes, alle oure thoghtes been
discovered as to hym, ne for preyere ne for meede he shal nat been
corrupt.  
<span id="an_168"></span> And therfore seith Salomon, "The wratthe of
God ne wol nat spare no wight, for preyere ne for yifte";  
<span id="an_168A"></span> and therfore, at the day of doom ther nys
noon hope to escape.  
<span id="an_169"></span> Wherfore, as seith Seint Anselm, "Ful greet
angwyssh shul the synful folk have at that tyme;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> ther shal the
stierne and wrothe juge sitte above, and under hym the horrible pit of
helle open to destroyen hym  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170A">170A</span></span> that moot
biknowen his synnes, whiche synnes openly been shewed biforn God and
biforn every creature;  
<span id="an_171"></span> and in the left syde mo develes than herte may
bithynke, for to harye and drawe the synful soules to the peyne of
helle;  
<span id="an_172"></span> and withinne the hertes of folk shal be the
bitynge conscience, and withouteforth shal be the world al brennynge.  
<span id="an_173"></span> Whider shal thanne the wrecched synful man
flee to hiden hym? Certes, he may nat hyden hym; he moste come forth and
shewen hym."  
<span id="an_174"></span> For certes, as seith Seint Jerome, "the erthe
shal casten hym out of hym, and the see also,  
<span id="an_174A"></span> and the eyr also, that shal be ful of
thonder-clappes and lightnynges."  
<span id="an_175"></span> Now soothly, whoso wel remembreth hym of thise
thynges, I gesse that his synne shal nat turne hym into delit,  
<span id="an_175A"></span> but to greet sorwe for drede of the peyne of
helle.  
<span id="an_176"></span> And therfore seith Job to God, "Suffre, Lord,
that I may a while biwaille and wepe,  
<span id="an_176A"></span> er I go withoute returnyng to the derke lond,
covered with the derknesse of deeth,  
<span id="an_177"></span> to the lond of mysese and of derknesse,
whereas is the shadwe of deeth,  
<span id="an_177A"></span> whereas ther is noon ordre or ordinaunce but
grisly drede that evere shal laste."  
<span id="an_178"></span> Loo, heere may ye seen that Job preyde respit
a while to biwepe and waille his trespas,  
<span id="an_178A"></span> for soothly oo day of respit is bettre than
al the tresor of this world.  
<span id="an_179"></span> And forasmuche as a man may acquiten hymself
biforn God by penitence in this world, and nat by tresor,  
<span id="an_179A"></span> therfore sholde he preye to God to yeve hym
respit a while to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> For certes,
al the sorwe that a man myghte make fro the bigynnyng of the world  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180A">180A</span></span> nys but a
litel thyng at regard of the sorwe of helle.  
<span id="an_181"></span> The cause why that Job clepeth helle the "lond
of derkness.":  
<span id="an_182"></span> understondeth that he clepeth it "lond" or
erthe, for it is stable and nevere shal faille; "derk,"  
<span id="an_182A"></span> for he that is in helle hath defaute of light
material.  
<span id="an_183"></span> For certes, the derke light that shal come out
of the fyr that evere shal brenne  
<span id="an_183A"></span> shal turne hym al to peyne that is in helle
for it sheweth him to the horrible develes that hym tormenten.  
<span id="an_184"></span> "Covered with the derknesse of deeth" -- that
is to seyn, that  
<span id="an_184A"></span> he that is in helle shal have defaute of the
sighte of God, for certes the sighte of God is the lyf perdurable.  
<span id="an_185"></span> "The derknesse of deeth" been the synnes that
the wrecched man hath doon, whiche that destourben hym to see the face
of God,  
<span id="an_185A"></span> right as dooth a derk clowde bitwixe us and
the sonne.  
<span id="an_186"></span> "Lond of misese," by cause that ther been
three maneres of defautes,  
<span id="an_186A"></span> agayn three thynges that folk of this world
han in this present lyf; that is to seyn, honours, delices, and
richesses.  
<span id="an_187"></span> Agayns honour, have they in helle shame and
confusioun.  
<span id="an_188"></span> For wel ye woot that men clepen honour the
reverence that man doth to man, but in helle is noon honour ne
reverence.  
<span id="an_188A"></span> For certes, namoore reverence shal be doon
there to a kyng than to a knave.  
<span id="an_189"></span> For which God seith by the prophete Jeremye,
"Thilke folk that me despisen shul been in despit."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> Honour is eek
cleped greet lordshipe; ther shal no wight serven other, but of harm  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190A">190A</span></span> and
torment. Honour is eek cleped greet dignytee and heighnesse, but in
helle shul they been al fortroden of develes.  
<span id="an_191"></span> And God seith, "The horrible develes shulle
goon and comen upon the hevedes of the dampned folk." And this is for as
muche as  
<span id="an_191A"></span> the hyer that they were in this present lyf,
the moore shulle they been abated and defouled in helle.  
<span id="an_192"></span> Agayns the richesse of this world shul they
han mysese of poverte, and this poverte shal been in foure thynges:  
<span id="an_193"></span> In defaute of tresor, of which that David
seith, "The riche folk, that embraceden and oneden al hire herte to
tresor of this world,  
<span id="an_193A"></span> shul slepe in the slepynge of deeth; and
nothyng ne shal they fynden in hir handes of al hir tresor."  
<span id="an_194"></span> And mooreover the myseyse of helle shal been
in defaute of mete and drinke.  
<span id="an_195"></span> For God seith thus by Moyses: "They shul been
wasted with hunger, and the briddes of helle shul devouren hem with
bitter deeth,  
<span id="an_195A"></span> and the galle of the dragon shal been hire
drynke, and the venym of the dragon hire morsels."  
<span id="an_196"></span> And forther over, hire myseyse shal been in
defaute of clothyng, for they shulle be naked in body as of clothyng,  
<span id="an_196A"></span> save the fyr in which they brenne, and othere
filthes;  
<span id="an_197"></span> and naked shul they been of soule, as of alle
manere vertues, which that is the clothyng of the soule.  
<span id="an_197A"></span> Where been thanne the gaye robes, and the
softe shetes, and the smale shertes?  
<span id="an_198"></span> Loo, what seith God of hem by the prophete
Ysaye: that  
<span id="an_198A"></span> "under hem shul been strawed motthes, and
hire covertures shulle been of wormes of helle."  
<span id="an_199"></span> And forther over, hir myseyse shal been in
defaute of freendes.  
<span id="an_199A"></span> For he nys nat povre that hath goode
freendes; but there is no frend,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> for neither
God ne no creature shal been freend to hem, and everich of hem shal
haten oother with deedly hate.  
<span id="an_201"></span> "The sones and the doghtren shullen rebellen
agayns fader and mooder, and kynrede agayns kynrede, and chiden  
<span id="an_201A"></span> and despisen everich of hem oother bothe day
and nyght," as God seith by the prophete Michias.  
<span id="an_202"></span> And the lovynge children, that whilom loveden
so flesshly everich oother, wolden everich of hem eten oother if they
myghte.  
<span id="an_203"></span> For how sholden they love hem togidre in the
peyne of helle,  
<span id="an_203A"></span> whan they hated everich of hem oother in the
prosperitee of this lyf?  
<span id="an_204"></span> For truste wel, hir flesshly love was deedly
hate, as seith the prophete David: "Whoso that loveth wikkednesse, he
hateth his soule."  
<span id="an_205"></span> And whoso hateth his owene soule, certes, he
may love noon oother wight in no manere.  
<span id="an_206"></span> And therfore, in helle is no solas ne no
freendshipe, but evere the moore flesshly kynredes that been in helle,  
<span id="an_206A"></span> the moore cursynges, the more chidynges, and
the moore deedly hate ther is among hem.  
<span id="an_207"></span> And forther over, they shul have defaute of
alle manere delices.  
<span id="an_207A"></span> For certes, delices been after the appetites
of the fyve wittes, as sighte, herynge, smellynge, savorynge, and
touchynge.  
<span id="an_208"></span> But in helle hir sighte shal be ful of
derknesse and of smoke,  
<span id="an_208A"></span> and therfore ful of teeres; and hir herynge
ful of waymentynge and of gryntynge of teeth, as seith Jhesu Crist.  
<span id="an_209"></span> Hir nose-thirles shullen be ful of stynkynge
stynk; and, as seith Ysaye the prophete, "hir savoryng shal be ful of
bitter galle";  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> and touchynge
of al hir body ycovered with "fir  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210A">210A</span></span> that nevere
shal quenche and with wormes that nevere shul dyen,"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210B">210B</span></span> as God
seith by the mouth of Ysaye.  
<span id="an_211"></span> And for as muche as they shul nat wene that
they may dyen for peyne, and by hir deeth flee fro peyne,  
<span id="an_211A"></span> that may they understonden by the word of
Job, that seith, "ther as is the shadwe of deeth."  
<span id="an_212"></span> Certes, a shadwe hath the liknesse of the
thyng of which it is shadwe,  
<span id="an_212A"></span> but shadwe is nat the same thyng of which it
is shadwe.  
<span id="an_213"></span> Right so fareth the peyne of helle; it is lyk
deeth for the horrible angwissh, and why?  
<span id="an_213A"></span> For it peyneth hem evere, as though they
sholde dye anon; but certes, they shal nat dye.  
<span id="an_214"></span> For, as seith Seint Gregorie, "To wrecche
caytyves shal be deeth withoute deeth, and ende withouten ende, and
defaute withoute failynge.  
<span id="an_215"></span> For hir deeth shal alwey lyven, and hir ende
shal everemo bigynne, and hir defaute shal nat faille."  
<span id="an_216"></span> And therfore seith Seint John the Evaungelist,
"They shullen folwe deeth,  
<span id="an_216A"></span> and they shul nat fynde hym; and they shul
desiren to dye, and deeth shal flee fro hem."  
<span id="an_217"></span> And eek Job seith that in helle is noon ordre
of rule.  
<span id="an_218"></span> And al be it so that God hath creat alle
thynges in right ordre, and no thyng withouten ordre,  
<span id="an_218A"></span> but alle thynges been ordeyned and nombred;
yet, nathelees, they that been dampned been nothyng in ordre, ne holden
noon ordre,  
<span id="an_219"></span> for the erthe ne shal bere hem no fruyt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> For, as the
prophete David seith, "God shal destroie the fruyt of the erthe as fro
hem;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220A">220A</span></span> ne water ne
shal yeve hem no moisture, ne the eyr no refresshyng, ne fyr no
light."  
<span id="an_221"></span> For, as seith Seint Basilie, "The brennynge of
the fyr of this world shal God yeven in helle to hem that been
dampned,  
<span id="an_222"></span> but the light and the cleernesse shal be yeven
in hevene to his children,"  
<span id="an_222A"></span> right as the goode man yeveth flessh to his
children and bones to his houndes.  
<span id="an_223"></span> And for they shullen have noon hope to escape,
seith Seint Job atte laste that "ther shal horrour and grisly drede
dwellen withouten ende."  
<span id="an_224"></span> Horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to
come, and this drede shal evere dwelle in the hertes of hem that been
dampned.  
<span id="an_224A"></span> And therfore han they lorn al hire hope, for
sevene causes.  
<span id="an_225"></span> First, for God, that is hir juge, shal be
withouten mercy to hem; and they may nat plese hym ne noon of his
halwes;  
<span id="an_225A"></span> ne they ne may yeve no thyng for hir
raunsoun;  
<span id="an_226"></span> ne they have no voys to speke to hym; ne they
may nat fle fro peyne;  
<span id="an_226A"></span> ne they have no goodnesse in hem, that they
mowe shewe to delivere hem fro peyne.  
<span id="an_227"></span> And therfore seith Salomon: "The wikked man
dyeth, and whan he is deed, he shal have noon hope to escape fro
peyne."  
<span id="an_228"></span> Whoso thanne wolde wel understande thise
peynes and bithynke hym weel that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his
synnes,  
<span id="an_228A"></span> certes, he sholde have moore talent to siken
and to wepe than for to syngen and to pleye.  
<span id="an_229"></span> For, as that seith Salomon, "Whoso that hadde
the science to knowe the peynes  
<span id="an_229A"></span> that been establissed and ordeyned for synne,
he wolde make sorwe."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> "Thilke
science," as seith Seint Augustyn, "maketh a man to waymenten in his
herte."  
<span id="an_231"></span> The fourthe point that oghte maken a man to
have contricion is the sorweful remembraunce of the good  
<span id="an_231A"></span> that he hath left to doon heere in erthe, and
eek the good that he hath lorn.  
<span id="an_232"></span> Soothly, the goode werkes that he hath lost,
outher they been the goode werkes that he wroghte er he fel into deedly
synne  
<span id="an_232A"></span> or elles the goode werkes that he wroghte
while he lay in synne.  
<span id="an_233"></span> Soothly, the goode werkes that he dide biforn
that he fil in synne been al mortefied and astoned and dulled by the
ofte synnyng.  
<span id="an_234"></span> The othere goode werkes, that he wroghte whil
he lay in deedly synne,  
<span id="an_234A"></span> thei been outrely dede, as to the lyf
perdurable in hevene.  
<span id="an_235"></span> Thanne thilke goode werkes that been mortefied
by ofte synnyng,  
<span id="an_235A"></span> whiche goode werkes he dide whil he was in
charitee, ne mowe nevere quyken agayn withouten verray penitence.  
<span id="an_236"></span> And therof seith God by the mouth of Ezechiel,
that  
<span id="an_236A"></span> "if the rightful man returne agayn from his
rightwisnesse and werke wikkednesse, shal he lyve?"  
<span id="an_237"></span> Nay, for alle the goode werkes that he hath
wroght ne shul nevere been in remembraunce, for he shal dyen in his
synne.  
<span id="an_238"></span> And upon thilke chapitre seith Seint Gregorie
thus: that "we shulle understonde this principally;  
<span id="an_239"></span> that whan we doon deedly synne,  
<span id="an_239A"></span> it is for noght thanne to rehercen or drawen
into memorie the goode werkes that we han wroght biforn."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> For certes,
in the werkynge of the deedly synne, ther is no trust to no good werk
that we han doon biforn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240A">240A</span></span> that is to
seyn, as for to have therby the lyf perdurable in hevene.  
<span id="an_241"></span> But nathelees, the goode werkes quyken agayn,
and comen agayn, and helpen,  
<span id="an_241A"></span> and availlen to have the lyf perdurable in
hevene, whan we han contricioun.  
<span id="an_242"></span> But soothly, the goode werkes that men doon
whil they been in deedly synne,  
<span id="an_242A"></span> for as muche as they were doon in deedly
synne, they may nevere quyke agayn.  
<span id="an_243"></span> For certes, thyng that nevere hadde lyf may
nevere quykene; and nathelees, al be it that they ne availle noght to
han the lyf perdurable,  
<span id="an_243A"></span> yet availlen they to abregge of the peyne of
helle, or elles to geten temporal richesse,  
<span id="an_244"></span> or elles that God wole the rather enlumyne and
lightne the herte of the synful man to have repentaunce;  
<span id="an_245"></span> and eek they availlen for to usen a man to
doon goode werkes, that the feend have the lasse power of his soule.  
<span id="an_246"></span> And thus the curteis Lord Jhesu Crist ne wole
that no good werk be lost, for in somwhat it shal availle.  
<span id="an_247"></span> But, for as muche as the goode werkes that men
doon whil they been in good lyf been al mortefied by synne folwynge,  
<span id="an_247A"></span> and eek sith that alle the goode werkes that
men doon whil they been in deedly synne been outrely dede  
<span id="an_247B"></span> as for to have the lyf perdurable,  
<span id="an_248"></span> wel may that man that no good werk ne dooth
synge thilke newe Frenshe song, "Jay tout perdu mon temps et mon
labour."  
<span id="an_249"></span> For certes, synne bireveth a man bothe
goodnesse of nature and eek the goodnesse of grace.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> For soothly,
the grace of the Hooly Goost fareth lyk fyr, that may nat been ydel;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250A">250A</span></span> for fyr
fayleth anoon as it forleteth his wirkynge, and right so grace fayleth
anoon as it forleteth his werkynge.  
<span id="an_251"></span> Then leseth the synful man the goodnesse of
glorie, that oonly is bihight to goode men that labouren and werken.  
<span id="an_252"></span> Wel may he be sory thanne, that oweth al his
lif to God as longe as he hath lyved, and eek as longe  
<span id="an_252A"></span> as he shal lyve, that no goodnesse ne hath to
paye with his dette to God to whom he oweth al his lyf.  
<span id="an_253"></span> For trust wel, "He shal yeven acountes," as
seith Seint Bernard,  
<span id="an_253A"></span> "of alle the goodes that han be yeven hym in
this present lyf, and how he hath hem despended,  
<span id="an_254"></span> \[in\] so muche that ther shal nat perisse an
heer of his heed, ne a moment of an houre  
<span id="an_254A"></span> ne shal nat perisse of his tyme, that he ne
shal yeve of it a rekenyng."  
<span id="an_255"></span> The fifthe thyng that oghte moeve a man to
contricioun  
<span id="an_255A"></span> is remembrance of the passioun that oure Lord
Jhesu Crist suffred for oure synnes.  
<span id="an_256"></span> For, as seith Seint Bernard, "Whil that I lyve
I shal have remembrance of the travailles that oure Lord Crist suffred
in prechyng:  
<span id="an_257"></span> his werynesse in travaillyng, his temptaciouns
whan he fasted, his longe wakynges  
<span id="an_257A"></span> whan he preyde, hise teeres whan that he weep
for pitee of good peple,  
<span id="an_258"></span> the wo and the shame and the filthe that men
seyden to hym, of the foule spittyng that men spitte in his face,  
<span id="an_258A"></span> of the buffettes that men yaven hym, of the
foule mowes, and of the repreves that men to hym seyden,  
<span id="an_259"></span> of the nayles with whiche he was nayled to the
croys,  
<span id="an_259A"></span> and of al the remenant of his passioun that
he suffred for my synnes, and no thyng for his gilt."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> And ye shul
understonde that in mannes synne is every manere of ordre or ordinaunce
turned up-so-doun.  
<span id="an_261"></span> For it is sooth that God, and resoun, and
sensualitee, and the body of man been so ordeyned  
<span id="an_261A"></span> that everich of thise foure thynges sholde
have lordshipe over that oother,  
<span id="an_262"></span> as thus: God sholde have lordshipe over
resoun, and resoun over sensualitee, and sensualitee over the body of
man.  
<span id="an_263"></span> But soothly, whan man synneth, al this ordre
or ordinaunce is turned up-so-doun.  
<span id="an_264"></span> And therfore thanne, for as muche as the
resoun of man ne wol nat be subget ne obeisant to God, that is  
<span id="an_264A"></span> his lord by right, therfore leseth it the
lordshipe that it sholde have over sensualitee, and eek over the body of
man.  
<span id="an_265"></span> And why? For sensualitee rebelleth thanne
agayns resoun, and by that way leseth resoun the lordshipe over
sensualitee and over the body.  
<span id="an_266"></span> For right as resoun is rebel to God, right so
is bothe sensualitee rebel to resoun and the body also.  
<span id="an_267"></span> And certes this disordinaunce and this
rebellioun oure Lord Jhesu Crist aboghte upon his precious body ful
deere, and herkneth in which wise.  
<span id="an_268"></span> For as muche thanne as resoun is rebel to God,
therfore is man worthy to have sorwe and to be deed.  
<span id="an_269"></span> This suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man,
after that he hadde be bitraysed of his disciple, and distreyned and
bounde  
<span id="an_269A"></span> so that his blood brast out at every nayl of
his handes, as seith Seint Augustyn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> And forther
over, for as muchel as resoun of man ne wol nat daunte sensualitee whan
it may,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270A">270A</span></span> therfore is
man worthy to have shame; and this suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for
man, whan they spetten in his visage.  
<span id="an_271"></span> And forther over, for as muchel thanne as the
caytyf body of man is rebel bothe to resoun and to sensualitee,  
<span id="an_271A"></span> therfore is it worthy the deeth.  
<span id="an_272"></span> And this suffred oure Lord Jhesu Crist for man
upon the croys,  
<span id="an_272A"></span> where as ther was no part of his body free
withouten greet peyne and bitter passioun.  
<span id="an_273"></span> And al this suffred Jhesu Crist, that nevere
forfeted. And therfore resonably may be seyd of Jhesu in this manere:  
<span id="an_273A"></span> "To muchel am I peyned for the thynges that I
nevere deserved, and to muche defouled for shendshipe that man is worthy
to have."  
<span id="an_274"></span> And therfore may the synful man wel seye, as
seith Seint Bernard,  
<span id="an_274A"></span> "Acursed be the bitternesse of my synne, for
which ther moste be suffred so muchel bitternesse."  
<span id="an_275"></span> For certes, after the diverse
\[disordinaunces\] of oure wikkednesses was the passioun of Jhesu Crist
ordeyned in diverse thynges.  
<span id="an_276"></span> As thus: Certes, synful mannes soule is
bitraysed of the devel by coveitise of temporeel prosperitee, and
scorned by deceite  
<span id="an_276A"></span> whan he cheseth flesshly delices; and yet is
it tormented by inpacience of adversitee and bispet by servage and
subjeccioun of synne;  
<span id="an_276B"></span> and atte laste it is slayn fynally.  
<span id="an_277"></span> For this disordinaunce of synful man was Jhesu
Crist first bitraysed,  
<span id="an_277A"></span> and after that was he bounde, that cam for to
unbynden us of synne and peyne.  
<span id="an_278"></span> Thanne was he byscorned, that oonly sholde han
been honoured in alle thynges and of alle thynges.  
<span id="an_279"></span> Thanne was his visage, that oghte be desired
to be seyn of al mankynde, in which visage aungels desiren to looke,
vileynsly bispet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> Thanne was he
scourged, that no thyng hadde agilt; and finally, thanne was he
crucified and slayn.  
<span id="an_281"></span> Thanne was acompliced the word of Ysaye, "He
was wounded for oure mysdedes and defouled for oure felonies."  
<span id="an_282"></span> Now sith that Jhesu Crist took upon hymself
the peyne of alle oure wikkednesses, muchel oghte synful man wepen and
biwayle,  
<span id="an_282A"></span> that for his synnes Goddes sone of hevene
sholde al this peyne endure.  
<span id="an_283"></span> The sixte thyng that oghte moeve a man to
contricioun is the hope of three thynges; that is to seyn, foryifnesse
of synne,  
<span id="an_283A"></span> and the yifte of grace wel for to do, and the
glorie of hevene, with which God shal gerdone man for his goode dedes.  
<span id="an_284"></span> And for as muche as Jhesu Crist yeveth us
thise yiftes of his largesse and of his sovereyn bountee,  
<span id="an_284A"></span> therfore is he cleped Jhesus Nazarenus rex
Judeorum.  
<span id="an_285"></span> Jhesus is to seyn "saveour" or "salvacioun,"
on whom men shul hope to have foryifnesse of synnes, which that is
proprely salvacioun of synnes.  
<span id="an_286"></span> And therfore seyde the aungel to Joseph, "Thou
shalt clepen his name Jhesus, that shal saven his peple of hir
synnes."  
<span id="an_287"></span> And heerof seith Seint Peter: "Ther is noon
oother name under hevene  
<span id="an_287A"></span> that is yeve to any man, by which a man may
be saved, but oonly Jhesus."  
<span id="an_288"></span> Nazarenus is as muche for to seye as
"florisshynge," in which a man shal hope that  
<span id="an_288A"></span> he that yeveth hym remissioun of synnes shal
yeve hym eek grace wel for to do.  
<span id="an_288B"></span> For in the flour is hope of fruyt in tyme
comynge, and in foryifnesse of synnes hope of grace wel for to do.  
<span id="an_289"></span> "I was atte dore of thyn herte," seith Jhesus,
"and cleped for to entre. He that openeth to me shal have foryifnesse of
synne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> I wol entre
into hym by my grace and soupe with hym," by the goode werkes that he
shal doon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290A">290A</span></span> whiche
werkes been the foode of God; "and he shal soupe with me" by the grete
joye that I shal yeven hym.  
<span id="an_291"></span> Thus shal man hope, for his werkes of penaunce
that God shal yeven hym his regne, as he bihooteth hym in the gospel.  
<span id="an_292"></span> Now shal a man understonde in which manere
shal been his contricioun. I seye that it shal been universal and
total.  
<span id="an_292A"></span> This is to seyn, a man shal be verray
repentaunt for alle his synnes that he hath doon  
<span id="an_292B"></span> in delit of his thoght, for delit is ful
perilous.  
<span id="an_293"></span> For ther been two manere of consentynges: that
oon of hem is cleped consentynge of affeccioun,  
<span id="an_293A"></span> whan a man is moeved to do synne, and
deliteth hym longe for to thynke on that synne;  
<span id="an_294"></span> and his reson aperceyveth it wel that it is
synne agayns the lawe of God,  
<span id="an_294A"></span> and yet his resoun refreyneth nat his foul
delit or talent, though he se wel apertly that it is agayns the
reverence of God.  
<span id="an_294B"></span> Although his resoun ne consente noght to doon
that synne in dede,  
<span id="an_295"></span> yet seyn somme doctours that swich delit that
dwelleth longe, it is ful perilous, al be it nevere so lite.  
<span id="an_296"></span> And also a man sholde sorwe namely for al that
evere he hath desired agayn the lawe of God  
<span id="an_296A"></span> with parfit consentynge of his resoun, for
therof is no doute, that it is deedly synne in consentynge.  
<span id="an_297"></span> For certes, ther is no deedly synne that it
nas first in mannes thought  
<span id="an_297A"></span> and after that in his delit, and so forth
into consentynge and into dede.  
<span id="an_298"></span> Wherfore I seye that many men ne repenten hem
nevere of swiche thoghtes and delites,  
<span id="an_298A"></span> ne nevere shryven hem of it, but oonly of the
dede of grete synnes outward.  
<span id="an_299"></span> Wherfore I seye that swiche wikked delites and
wikked thoghtes been subtile bigileres of hem that shullen be dampned.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> Mooreover,
man oghte to sorwe for his wikkede wordes as wel as for his wikkede
dedes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300A">300A</span></span> For certes,
the repentaunce of a synguler synne, and nat repente of alle his othere
synnes,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300B">300B</span></span> or elles
repenten hym of alle his othere synnes and nat of a synguler synne, may
nat availle.  
<span id="an_301"></span> For certes, God almyghty is al good, and
therfore he foryeveth al or elles right noght.  
<span id="an_302"></span> And heerof seith Seint Augustyn,  
<span id="an_303"></span> "I wot certeynly that God is enemy to everich
synnere." And how thanne?  
<span id="an_303A"></span> He that observeth o synne, shal he have
foryifnesse of the remenaunt of his othere synnes? Nay.  
<span id="an_304"></span> And forther over, contricioun sholde be wonder
sorweful and angwissous; and therfore yeveth hym God pleynly his
mercy;  
<span id="an_304A"></span> and therfore, whan my soule was angwissous
withinne me, I hadde remembrance of God that my preyere myghte come to
hym.  
<span id="an_305"></span> Forther over, contricioun moste be continueel,
and that man have stedefast purpos to shriven hym, and for to amenden
hym of his lyf.  
<span id="an_306"></span> For soothly, whil contricioun lasteth, man may
evere have hope of foryifnesse;  
<span id="an_306A"></span> and of this comth hate of synne, that
destroyeth synne, bothe in himself and eek in oother folk at his
power.  
<span id="an_307"></span> For which seith David: "Ye that loven God,
hateth wikkednesse."  
<span id="an_307A"></span> For trusteth wel, to love God is for to love
that he loveth, and hate that he hateth.  
<span id="an_308"></span> The laste thyng that men shal understonde in
contricioun is this:  
<span id="an_308A"></span> wherof avayleth contricioun. I seye that
somtyme contricioun delivereth a man fro synne;  
<span id="an_309"></span> of which that David seith, "I seye," quod
David (that is to seyn,  
<span id="an_309A"></span> I purposed fermely) "to shryve me, and thow,
Lord, relessedest my synne."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_310">310</span></span> And right so
as contricion availleth noght withouten sad purpos of shrifte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_310A">310A</span></span> if man have
oportunitee, right so litel worth is shrifte or satisfaccioun withouten
contricioun.  
<span id="an_311"></span> And mooreover contricion destroyeth the
prisoun of helle, and maketh wayk and fieble alle the strengthes of the
develes,  
<span id="an_311A"></span> and restoreth the yiftes of the Hooly Goost
and of alle goode vertues;  
<span id="an_312"></span> and it clenseth the soule of synne, and
delivereth the soule fro the peyne of helle, and fro the compaignye of
the devel,  
<span id="an_312A"></span> and fro the servage of synne, and restoreth
it to alle goodes espirituels, and to the compaignye and communyoun of
hooly chirche.  
<span id="an_313"></span> And forther over, it maketh hym that whilom
was sone of ire to be sone of grace;  
<span id="an_313A"></span> and alle thise thynges been preved by hooly
writ.  
<span id="an_314"></span> And therfore, he that wolde sette his entente
to thise thynges, he were ful wys;  
<span id="an_314A"></span> for soothly he ne sholde nat thanne in al his
lyf have corage to synne,  
<span id="an_314B"></span> but yeven his body and al his herte to the
service of Jhesu Crist, and therof doon hym hommage.  
<span id="an_315"></span> For soothly oure sweete Lord Jhesu Crist hath
spared us so debonairly in oure folies that  
<span id="an_315A"></span> if he ne hadde pitee of mannes soule, a sory
song we myghten alle synge.  
<span id="an_316"></span> The seconde partie of Penitence is
Confessioun, that is signe of contricioun.  
<span id="an_317"></span> Now shul ye understonde what is Confessioun,  
<span id="an_317A"></span> and wheither it oghte nedes be doon or noon,
and whiche thynges been covenable to verray Confessioun.  
<span id="an_318"></span> First shaltow understonde that Confessioun is
verray shewynge of synnes to the preest.  
<span id="an_319"></span> This is to seyn "verray," for he moste
confessen hym of alle the condiciouns that bilongen to his synne, as
ferforth as he kan.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> Al moot be
seyd, and no thyng excused ne hyd ne forwrapped, and noght avaunte thee
of thy goode werkes.  
<span id="an_321"></span> And forther over, it is necessarie to
understonde whennes that synnes spryngen, and how they encreessen, and
whiche they been.  
<span id="an_322"></span> Of the spryngynge of synnes seith Seint Paul
in this wise: that "Right as by a man synne entred first into this
world,  
<span id="an_322A"></span> and thurgh that synne deeth, right so thilke
deeth entred into alle men that synneden."  
<span id="an_323"></span> And this man was Adam, by whom synne entred
into this world, whan he brak the comaundementz of God.  
<span id="an_324"></span> And therfore, he that first was so myghty that
he sholde nat have dyed, bicam swich oon that he moste nedes dye,  
<span id="an_324A"></span> wheither he wolde or noon, and al his
progenye in this world, that in thilke man synneden.  
<span id="an_325"></span> Looke that in th' estaat of innocence, whan
Adam and Eve naked weren in Paradys, and nothyng ne hadden shame of hir
nakednesse,  
<span id="an_326"></span> how that the serpent, that was moost wily of
alle othere beestes that God hadde maked, seyde to the womman,  
<span id="an_326A"></span> "Why comaunded God to yow ye sholde nat eten
of every tree in Paradys?"  
<span id="an_327"></span> The womman answerde: "Of the fruyt," quod she,
"of the trees in Paradys we feden us,  
<span id="an_327A"></span> but soothly, of the fruyt of the tree that is
in the myddel of Paradys, God forbad us for to ete,  
<span id="an_327B"></span> ne nat touchen it, lest per aventure we
sholde dyen."  
<span id="an_328"></span> The serpent seyde to the womman, "Nay, nay, ye
shul nat dyen of deeth; for sothe, God woot that  
<span id="an_328A"></span> what day that ye eten therof, youre eyen shul
opene and ye shul been as goddes, knowynge good and harm."  
<span id="an_329"></span> The womman thanne saugh that the tree was good
to feedyng, and fair to the eyen, and delitable to the sighte.  
<span id="an_329A"></span> She took of the fruyt of the tree, and eet
it, and yaf to hire housbonde,  
<span id="an_329B"></span> and he eet, and anoon the eyen of hem bothe
openeden.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> And whan that
they knewe that they were naked, they sowed of fige leves a maner of
breches to hiden hire membres.  
<span id="an_331"></span> There may ye seen that deedly synne hath,
first, suggestion of the feend, as sheweth heere by the naddre;  
<span id="an_331A"></span> and afterward, the delit of the flessh, as
sheweth heere by Eve; and after that, the consentynge of resoun, as
sheweth heere by Adam.  
<span id="an_332"></span> For trust wel, though so were that the feend
tempted Eve -- that is to seyn, the flessh --  
<span id="an_332A"></span> and the flessh hadde delit in the beautee of
the fruyt defended, yet certes, til that resoun -- that is to seyn, Adam
--  
<span id="an_332B"></span> consented to the etynge of the fruyt, yet
stood he in th' estaat of innocence.  
<span id="an_333"></span> Of thilke Adam tooke we thilke synne
original,  
<span id="an_333A"></span> for of hym flesshly descended be we alle, and
engendred of vile and corrupt mateere.  
<span id="an_334"></span> And whan the soule is put in oure body, right
anon is contract original synne;  
<span id="an_334A"></span> and that that was erst but oonly peyne of
concupiscence is afterward bothe peyne and synne.  
<span id="an_335"></span> And therfore be we alle born sones of wratthe
and of dampnacioun perdurable, if it nere baptesme that we receyven,  
<span id="an_335A"></span> which bynymeth us the culpe. But for sothe,
the peyne dwelleth with us, as to temptacioun, which peyne highte
concupiscence.  
<span id="an_336"></span> And this concupiscence, whan it is wrongfully
disposed or ordeyned in man, it maketh hym coveite, by coveitise of
flessh,  
<span id="an_336A"></span> flesshly synne, by sighte of his eyen as to
erthely thynges, and eek coveitise of hynesse by pride of herte.  
<span id="an_337"></span> Now, as for to speken of the firste coveitise,
that is concupiscence, after the lawe of oure membres  
<span id="an_337A"></span> that weren lawefulliche ymaked and by
rightful juggement of God,  
<span id="an_338"></span> I seye, forasmuche as man is nat obeisaunt to
God, that is his lord,  
<span id="an_338A"></span> therfore is the flessh to hym disobeisaunt
thurgh concupiscence, which yet is cleped norrissynge of synne and
occasioun of synne.  
<span id="an_339"></span> Therfore, al the while that a man hath in hym
the peyne of concupiscence,  
<span id="an_339A"></span> it is impossible but he be tempted somtime
and moeved in his flessh to synne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> And this
thyng may nat faille as longe as he lyveth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340A">340A</span></span> it may wel
wexe fieble and faille by vertu of baptesme and by the grace of God
thurgh penitence,  
<span id="an_341"></span> but fully ne shal it nevere quenche, that he
ne shal som tyme be moeved in hymself,  
<span id="an_341A"></span> but if he were al refreyded by siknesse, or
by malefice of sorcerie, or colde drynkes.  
<span id="an_342"></span> For lo, what seith Seint Paul: "The flessh
coveiteth agayn the spirit, and the spirit agayn the flessh;  
<span id="an_342A"></span> they been so contrarie and so stryven that a
man may nat alway doon as he wolde."  
<span id="an_343"></span> The same Seint Paul, after his grete penaunce
in water and in lond --  
<span id="an_343B"></span> in water by nyght and by day in greet peril
and in greet peyne;  
<span id="an_343C"></span> in lond, in famyne and thurst, in coold and
cloothlees, and ones stoned almoost to the deeth  
<span id="an_344"></span> -- yet seyde he, "Allas, I caytyf man! Who
shal delivere me fro the prisoun of my caytyf body?"  
<span id="an_345"></span> And Seint Jerome, whan he longe tyme hadde
woned in desert, where as he hadde no compaignye but of wilde beestes,  
<span id="an_345A"></span> where as he ne hadde no mete but herbes, and
water to his drynke, ne no bed but the naked erthe,  
<span id="an_345B"></span> for which his flessh was blak as an Ethiopeen
for heete, and ny destroyed for coold,  
<span id="an_346"></span> yet seyde he that "the brennynge of lecherie
boyled in al his body."  
<span id="an_347"></span> Wherfore I woot wel sykerly that they been
deceyved that seyn that they ne be nat tempted in hir body.  
<span id="an_348"></span> Witnesse on Seint Jame the Apostel, that seith
that "every wight is tempted in his owene concupiscence"; that is to
seyn,  
<span id="an_348A"></span> that everich of us hath matere and occasioun
to be tempted of the norissynge of synne that is in his body.  
<span id="an_349"></span> And therfore seith Seint John the Evaungelist,
"If that we seyn that we be withoute synne,  
<span id="an_349A"></span> we deceyve us selve, and trouthe is nat in
us."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> Now shal ye
understonde in what manere that synne wexeth or encreesseth in man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350A">350A</span></span> The firste
thyng is thilke norissynge of synne of which I spak biforn, thilke
flesshly concupiscence.  
<span id="an_351"></span> And after that comth the subjeccioun of the
devel --  
<span id="an_351A"></span> this is to seyn, the develes bely, with which
he bloweth in man the fir of flesshly concupiscence.  
<span id="an_352"></span> And after that, a man bithynketh hym wheither
he wol doon or no thilke thing to which he is tempted.  
<span id="an_353"></span> And thanne, if that a man withstonde and weyve
the firste entisynge of his flessh and of the feend,  
<span id="an_353A"></span> thanne is it no synne; and if it so be that
he do nat so, thanne feeleth he anoon a flambe of delit.  
<span id="an_354"></span> And thanne is it good to be war and kepen hym
wel,  
<span id="an_354A"></span> or elles he wol falle anon into consentynge
of synne; and thanne wol he do it, if he may have tyme and place.  
<span id="an_355"></span> And of this matere seith Moyses by the devel
in this manere: "The feend seith,  
<span id="an_355A"></span> \`I wole chace and pursue the man by wikked
suggestioun, and I wole hente hym by moevynge or stirynge of synne.  
<span id="an_355B"></span> And I wol departe my prise or my praye by
deliberacioun, and my lust shal been acompliced in delit.  
<span id="an_355C"></span> I wol drawe my swerd in consentyng.'" --  
<span id="an_356"></span> for certes, right as a swerd departeth a thyng
in two peces, right so consentynge departeth God fro man --  
<span id="an_356A"></span> "\`and thanne wol I sleen hym with myn hand
in dede of synne'; thus seith the feend."  
<span id="an_357"></span> For certes, thanne is a man al deed in
soule.  
<span id="an_357A"></span> And thus is synne acompliced by temptacioun,
by delit, and by consentynge; and thanne is the synne cleped actueel.  
<span id="an_358"></span> For sothe, synne is in two maneres; outher it
is venial or deedly synne.  
<span id="an_358A"></span> Soothly, whan man loveth any creature moore
than Jhesu Crist oure Creatour, thanne is it deedly synne.  
<span id="an_358B"></span> And venial synne is it, if man love Jhesu
Crist lasse than hym oghte.  
<span id="an_359"></span> For sothe, the dede of this venial synne is
ful perilous,  
<span id="an_359A"></span> for it amenuseth the love that men sholde han
to God moore and moore.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> And therfore,
if a man charge hymself with manye swiche venial synnes,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360A">360A</span></span> certes, but
if so be that he somtyme descharge hym of hem by shrifte,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360B">360B</span></span> they mowe
ful lightly amenuse in hym al the love that he hath to Jhesu Crist;  
<span id="an_361"></span> and in this wise skippeth venial into deedly
synne. For certes, the moore that a man chargeth his soule with venial
synnes,  
<span id="an_361A"></span> the moore is he enclyned to fallen into
deedly synne.  
<span id="an_362"></span> And therfore lat us nat be necligent to
deschargen us of venial synnes. For the proverbe seith that "Manye smale
maken a greet."  
<span id="an_363"></span> And herkne this ensample. A greet wawe of the
see comth som tyme with so greet a violence that it drencheth the
ship.  
<span id="an_363A"></span> And the same harm doon som tyme the smale
dropes of water, that entren thurgh a litel crevace into the thurrok,  
<span id="an_363B"></span> and in the botme of the ship, if men be so
necligent that they ne descharge hem nat by tyme.  
<span id="an_364"></span> And therfore, although ther be a difference
bitwixe thise two causes of drenchynge, algates the ship is dreynt.  
<span id="an_365"></span> Right so fareth it somtyme of deedly synne,
and of anoyouse veniale synnes,  
<span id="an_365A"></span> whan they multiplie in a man so greetly that
\[the love of\] thilke worldly thynges that he loveth,  
<span id="an_365B"></span> thurgh whiche he synneth venyally, is as
greet in his herte as the love of God, or moore.  
<span id="an_366"></span> And therfore, the love of every thyng that is
nat biset in God, ne doon principally for Goddes sake,  
<span id="an_366A"></span> although that a man love it lasse than God,
yet is it venial synne;  
<span id="an_367"></span> and deedly synne whan the love of any thyng
weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of God, or moore.  
<span id="an_368"></span> "Deedly synne," as seith Seint Augustyn, "is
whan a man turneth his herte fro God,  
<span id="an_368A"></span> which that is verray sovereyn bountee, that
may nat chaunge, and yeveth his herte to thyng that may chaunge and
flitte."  
<span id="an_369"></span> And certes, that is every thyng save God of
hevene.  
<span id="an_369A"></span> For sooth is that if a man yeve his love, the
which that he oweth al to God with al his herte, unto a creature,  
<span id="an_369B"></span> certes, as muche of his love as he yeveth to
thilke creature, so muche he bireveth fro God;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370">370</span></span> and therfore
dooth he synne. For he that is dettour to God ne yeldeth nat to God al
his dette;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370A">370A</span></span> that is to
seyn, al the love of his herte.  
<span id="an_371"></span> Now sith man understondeth generally which is
venial synne, thanne is it covenable to tellen specially of synnes
whiche that many  
<span id="an_371A"></span> a man peraventure ne demeth hem nat synnes,
and ne shryveth him nat of the same thynges, and yet natheless they been
synnes  
<span id="an_372"></span> soothly, as thise clerkes writen; this is to
seyn, that at every tyme that a man eteth or drynketh  
<span id="an_372A"></span> moore than suffiseth to the sustenaunce of
his body, in certein he dooth synne.  
<span id="an_373"></span> And eek whan he speketh moore than it nedeth,
it is synne. Eke whan he herkneth nat benignely the compleint of the
povre;  
<span id="an_374"></span> eke whan he is in heele of body and wol nat
faste whan other folk faste, withouten cause resonable;  
<span id="an_374A"></span> eke whan he slepeth moore than nedeth, or
whan he comth by thilke enchesoun to late to chirche, or to othere
werkes of charite;  
<span id="an_375"></span> eke whan he useth his wyf withouten sovereyn
desir of engendrure to the honour of God  
<span id="an_375A"></span> or for the entente to yelde to his wyf the
dette of his body;  
<span id="an_376"></span> eke whan he wol nat visite the sike and the
prisoner, if he may;  
<span id="an_376A"></span> eke if he love wyf or child, or oother
worldly thyng, moore than resoun requireth.  
<span id="an_376B"></span> eke if he flatere or blandise moore than hym
oghte for any necessitee;  
<span id="an_377"></span> eke if he amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of
the povre;  
<span id="an_377A"></span> eke if he apparailleth his mete moore
deliciously than nede is, or ete it to hastily by likerousnesse;  
<span id="an_378"></span> eke if he tale vanytees at chirche or at
Goddes service, or that he be a talker  
<span id="an_378A"></span> of ydel wordes of folye or of vileynye, for
he shal yelden acountes of it at the day of doom;  
<span id="an_379"></span> eke whan he biheteth or assureth to do thynges
that he may nat parfourne;  
<span id="an_379A"></span> eke whan that he by lightnesse or folie
mysseyeth or scorneth his neighebor;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> eke whan he
hath any wikked suspecioun of thyng ther he ne woot of it no
soothfastnesse:  
<span id="an_381"></span> thise thynges, and mo withoute nombre, been
synnes, as seith Seint Augustyn.  
<span id="an_382"></span> Now shal men understonde that, al be it so
that noon erthely man may eschue alle venial synnes,  
<span id="an_382A"></span> yet may he refreyne hym by the brennynge love
that he hath to oure Lord Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_382B"></span> and by preyeres and confessioun and othere
goode werkes, so that it shal but litel greve.  
<span id="an_383"></span> For, as seith Seint Augustyn, "If a man love
God in swich manere that al that evere he dooth  
<span id="an_383B"></span> is in the love of God and for the love of God
verraily, for he brenneth in the love of God,  
<span id="an_384"></span> looke how muche that a drope of water that
falleth in a fourneys ful of fyr anoyeth  
<span id="an_384A"></span> or greveth, so muche anoyeth a venial synne
unto a man that is parfit in the love of Jhesu Crist."  
<span id="an_385"></span> Men may also refreyne venial synne by
receyvynge worthily of the precious body of Jhesu Crist;  
<span id="an_386"></span> by receyvynge eek of hooly water, by
almesdede, by general confessioun of Confiteor at masse and at
complyn,  
<span id="an_386A"></span> and by blessynge of bisshopes and of
preestes, and by oothere goode werkes.  
<span id="an_387"></span> Now is it bihovely thyng to telle whiche been
the sevene deedly synnes,  
<span id="an_387A"></span> this is to seyn, chieftaynes of synnes. Alle
they renne in o lees, but in diverse manneres.  
<span id="an_387B"></span> Now been they cleped chieftaynes, for as
muche as they been chief and spryng of alle othere synnes.  
<span id="an_388"></span> Of the roote of thise sevene synnes, thanne,
is Pride the general roote of alle harmes.  
<span id="an_388B"></span> For of this roote spryngen certein braunches,
as Ire, Envye, Accidie or Slewthe, Avarice or Coveitise (to commune
understondynge), Glotonye, and Lecherye.  
<span id="an_389"></span> And everich of thise chief synnes hath his
braunches and his twigges, as shal be declared in hire chapitres
folwynge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> And thogh so
be that no man kan outrely telle the nombre of the twigges and of the
harmes that cometh of Pride,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390A">390A</span></span> yet wol I
shewe a partie of hem, as ye shul understonde.  
<span id="an_391"></span> Ther is inobedience, avauntynge, ypocrisie,
despit, arrogance, inpudence, swellynge of herte, insolence, elacioun,
inpacience, strif, contumacie, presumpcioun, irreverence, pertinacie,
veyneglorie,  
<span id="an_391A"></span> and many another twig that I kan nat
declare.  
<span id="an_392"></span> Inobedient is he that disobeyeth for despit to
the comandementz of God, and to his sovereyns, and to his goostly
fader.  
<span id="an_393"></span> Avauntour is he that bosteth of the harm or of
the bountee that he hath doon.  
<span id="an_394"></span> Ypocrite is he that hideth to shewe hym swich
as he is and sheweth hym swich as he noght is.  
<span id="an_395"></span> Despitous is he that hath desdeyn of his
neighebor --  
<span id="an_395A"></span> that is to seyn, of his evene-Cristene -- or
hath despit to doon that hym oghte to do.  
<span id="an_396"></span> Arrogant is he that thynketh that he hath
thilke bountees in hym that he hath noght,  
<span id="an_396A"></span> or weneth that he sholde have hem by his
desertes, or elles he demeth that he be that he nys nat.  
<span id="an_397"></span> Inpudent is he that for his pride hath no
shame of his synnes.  
<span id="an_398"></span> Swellynge of herte is whan a man rejoyseth hym
of harm that he hath doon.  
<span id="an_399"></span> Insolent is he that despiseth in his juggement
alle othere folk,  
<span id="an_399A"></span> as to regard of his value, and of his
konnyng, and of his spekyng, and of his beryng.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> Elacioun is
whan he ne may neither suffre to have maister ne felawe.  
<span id="an_401"></span> Inpacient is he that wol nat been ytaught ne
undernome of his vice, and by strif werreieth trouthe wityngly, and
deffendeth his folye.  
<span id="an_402"></span> Contumax is he that thurgh his indignacioun is
agayns everich auctoritee or power of hem that been his sovereyns.  
<span id="an_403"></span> Presumpcioun is whan a man undertaketh an
emprise that hym oghte nat do, or elles that he may nat do;  
<span id="an_403A"></span> and this is called surquidrie. Irreverence is
whan men do nat honour there as hem oghte to doon, and waiten to be
reverenced.  
<span id="an_404"></span> Pertinacie is whan man deffendeth his folie
and trusteth to muchel to his owene wit.  
<span id="an_405"></span> Veyneglorie is for to have pompe and delit in
his temporeel hynesse, and glorifie hym in this worldly estaat.  
<span id="an_406"></span> Janglynge is whan a man speketh to muche
biforn folk, and clappeth as a mille, and taketh no keep what he
seith.  
<span id="an_407"></span> And yet is ther a privee spece of Pride that
waiteth first to be salewed  
<span id="an_407A"></span> er he wole salewe, al be he lasse worth than
that oother is, peraventure;  
<span id="an_407B"></span> and eek he waiteth or desireth to sitte, or
elles to goon above hym in the wey,  
<span id="an_407C"></span> or kisse pax, or been encensed, or goon to
offryng biforn his neighebor,  
<span id="an_408"></span> and swiche semblable thynges, agayns his
duetee, peraventure, but that he hath his herte  
<span id="an_408A"></span> and his entente in swich a proud desir to be
magnified and honoured biforn the peple.  
<span id="an_409"></span> Now been ther two maneres of Pride: that oon
of hem is withinne the herte of man, and that oother is withoute.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> Of whiche,
soothly, thise forseyde thynges, and mo than I have seyd, apertenen to
Pride that is in the herte of man;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410A">410A</span></span> and that
othere speces of Pride been withoute.  
<span id="an_411"></span> But natheles that oon of thise speces of Pride
is signe of that oother,  
<span id="an_411A"></span> right as the gaye leefsel atte taverne is
signe of the wyn that is in the celer.  
<span id="an_412"></span> And this is in manye thynges: as in speche and
contenaunce, and in outrageous array of clothyng.  
<span id="an_413"></span> For certes, if ther ne hadde be no synne in
clothyng,  
<span id="an_413A"></span> Crist wolde nat so soone have noted and
spoken of the clothyng of thilke riche man in the gospel.  
<span id="an_414"></span> And, as seith Seint Gregorie, that "precious
clothyng is cowpable for the derthe of it, and for his softenesse,  
<span id="an_414A"></span> and for his strangenesse and degisynesse, and
for the superfluitee, or for the inordinat scantnesse of it."  
<span id="an_415"></span> Allas, may man nat seen, as in oure dayes, the
synful costlewe array of clothynge,  
<span id="an_415A"></span> and namely in to muche superfluite, or elles
in to desordinat scantnesse?  
<span id="an_416"></span> As to the first synne, that is in superfluitee
of clothynge, which that maketh it so deere, to harm of the peple;  
<span id="an_417"></span> nat oonly the cost of embrowdynge, the degise
endentynge or barrynge, owndynge, palynge, wyndynge or bendynge, and
semblable wast of clooth in vanitee,  
<span id="an_418"></span> but ther is also costlewe furrynge in hir
gownes, so muche pownsonynge of chisels to maken holes, so muche
daggynge of sheres;  
<span id="an_419"></span> forth-with the superfluitee in lengthe of the
forseide gownes, trailynge in the dong and in the mire, on horse and eek
on foote,  
<span id="an_419A"></span> as wel of man as of womman, that al thilke
trailyng is verraily as in effect wasted, consumed, thredbare, and roten
with donge,  
<span id="an_419B"></span> rather than it is yeven to the povre, to
greet damage of the forseyde povre folk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420">420</span></span> And that in
sondry wise; this is to seyn that the moore that clooth is wasted,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420A">420A</span></span> the moore
moot it coste to the peple for the scarsnesse.  
<span id="an_421"></span> And forther over, if so be that they wolde
yeven swich pownsoned and dagged clothyng to the povre folk,  
<span id="an_421A"></span> it is nat convenient to were for hire estaat,
ne suffisant to beete hire necessitee, to kepe hem fro the distemperance
of the firmament.  
<span id="an_422"></span> Upon that oother side, to speken of the
horrible disordinat scantnesse of clothyng, as been thise kutted
sloppes, or haynselyns,  
<span id="an_422A"></span> that thurgh hire shortnesse ne covere nat the
shameful membres of man, to wikked entente.  
<span id="an_423"></span> Allas, somme of hem shewen the boce of hir
shap, and the horrible swollen membres,  
<span id="an_423A"></span> that semeth lik the maladie of hirnia, in the
wrappynge of hir hoses;  
<span id="an_424"></span> and eek the buttokes of hem faren as it were
the hyndre part of a she-ape in the fulle of the moone.  
<span id="an_425"></span> And mooreover, the wrecched swollen membres
that they shewe thurgh disgisynge,  
<span id="an_425A"></span> in departynge of hire hoses in whit and reed,
semeth that half hir shameful privee membres weren flayne.  
<span id="an_426"></span> And if so be that they departen hire hoses in
othere colours,  
<span id="an_426A"></span> as is whit and blak, or whit and blew, or
blak and reed, and so forth,  
<span id="an_427"></span> thanne semeth it, as by variaunce of colour,
that half the partie of hire privee membres were corrupt  
<span id="an_427A"></span> by the fir of Seint Antony, or by cancre, or
by oother swich meschaunce.  
<span id="an_428"></span> Of the hyndre part of hir buttokes, it is ful
horrible for to see.  
<span id="an_428A"></span> For certes, in that partie of hir body ther
as they purgen hir stynkynge ordure,  
<span id="an_429"></span> that foule partie shewe they to the peple
prowdly in despit of honestitee,  
<span id="an_429A"></span> which honestitee that Jhesu Crist and his
freendes observede to shewen in hir lyve.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> Now, as of
the outrageous array of wommen, God woot that though the visages of
somme of hem seme ful chaast and debonaire,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430A">430A</span></span> yet notifie
they in hire array of atyr likerousnesse and pride.  
<span id="an_431"></span> I sey nat that honestitee in clothynge of man
or womman is uncovenable, but certes the superfluitee or disordinat
scantitee of clothynge is reprevable.  
<span id="an_432"></span> Also the synne of aornement or of apparaille
is in thynges that apertenen to ridynge,  
<span id="an_432A"></span> as in to manye delicat horses that been
hoolden for delit, that been so faire, fatte, and costlewe;  
<span id="an_433"></span> and also in many a vicious knave that is
sustened by cause of hem; and in to curious harneys,  
<span id="an_433A"></span> as in sadeles, in crouperes, peytrels, and
bridles covered with precious clothyng, and riche barres and plates of
gold and of silver.  
<span id="an_434"></span> For which God seith by Zakarie the prophete,
"I wol confounde the rideres of swiche horses."  
<span id="an_435"></span> This folk taken litel reward of the ridynge of
Goddes sone of hevene, and of his harneys whan he rood upon the asse,  
<span id="an_435A"></span> and ne hadde noon oother harneys but the
povre clothes of his disciples;  
<span id="an_435B"></span> ne we ne rede nat that evere he rood on
oother beest.  
<span id="an_436"></span> I speke this for the synne of superfluitee,
and nat for resonable honestitee, whan reson it requireth.  
<span id="an_437"></span> And forther over, certes, pride is greetly
notified in holdynge of greet meynee, whan they be of litel profit or of
right no profit,  
<span id="an_438"></span> and namely whan that meynee is felonous and
damageous to the peple by hardynesse of heigh lordshipe or by wey of
offices.  
<span id="an_439"></span> For certes, swiche lordes sellen thanne hir
lordshipe to the devel of helle, whanne they sustenen the wikkednesse of
hir meynee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> Or elles,
whan this folk of lowe degree, as thilke that holden hostelries,
sustenen the thefte of hire hostilers,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440A">440A</span></span> and that is
in many manere of deceites.  
<span id="an_441"></span> Thilke manere of folk been the flyes that
folwen the hony,  
<span id="an_441A"></span> or elles the houndes that folwen the careyne.
Swich forseyde folk stranglen spiritually hir lordshipes;  
<span id="an_442"></span> for which thus seith David the prophete:  
<span id="an_442A"></span> "Wikked deeth moote come upon thilke
lordshipes, and God yeve that they moote descenden into helle al doun,  
<span id="an_442B"></span> for in hire houses been iniquitees and
shrewednesses and nat God of hevene."  
<span id="an_443"></span> And certes, but if they doon amendement, right
as God yaf his benysoun to \[Laban\] by the service of Jacob,  
<span id="an_443A"></span> and to \[Pharao\] by the service of Joseph,
right so God wol yeve his malisoun  
<span id="an_443B"></span> to swiche lordshipes as sustenen the
wikkednesse of hir servauntz, but they come to amendement.  
<span id="an_444"></span> Pride of the table appeereth eek ful ofte; for
certes, riche men been cleped to festes, and povre folk been put awey
and rebuked.  
<span id="an_445"></span> Also in excesse of diverse metes and drynkes,
and namely swich manere bake-metes and dissh-metes, brennynge of wilde
fir  
<span id="an_445A"></span> and peynted and castelled with papir, and
semblable wast, so that it is abusioun for to thynke.  
<span id="an_446"></span> And eek in to greet preciousnesse of vessel
and curiositee of mynstralcie, by whiche a man is stired the moore to
delices of luxurie,  
<span id="an_447"></span> if so be that he sette his herte the lasse
upon oure Lord Jhesu Crist, certeyn it is a synne;  
<span id="an_447A"></span> and certeinly the delices myghte been so
grete in this caas that man myghte lightly falle by hem into deedly
synne.  
<span id="an_448"></span> The especes that sourden of Pride, soothly
whan they sourden of malice ymagined, avised, and forncast,  
<span id="an_448A"></span> or elles of usage, been deedly synnes, it is
no doute.  
<span id="an_449"></span> And whan they sourden by freletee unavysed,
and sodeynly withdrawen  
<span id="an_449A"></span> ayeyn, al been they grevouse synnes, I gesse
that they ne been nat deedly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> Now myghte
men axe wherof that Pride sourdeth and spryngeth, and I seye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450A">450A</span></span> somtyme it
spryngeth of the goodes of nature, and somtyme of the goodes of fortune,
and somtyme of the goodes of grace.  
<span id="an_451"></span> Certes, the goodes of nature stonden outher in
goodes of body or in goodes of soule.  
<span id="an_452"></span> Certes, goodes of body been heele of body,
strengthe, delivernesse, beautee, gentrice, franchise.  
<span id="an_453"></span> Goodes of nature of the soule been good wit,
sharp understondynge, subtil engyn, vertu natureel, good memorie.  
<span id="an_454"></span> Goodes of fortune been richesse, hyghe degrees
of lordshipes, preisynges of the peple.  
<span id="an_455"></span> Goodes of grace been science, power to suffre
spiritueel travaille, benignitee, vertuous contemplacioun, withstondynge
of temptacioun, and semblable thynges.  
<span id="an_456"></span> Of whiche forseyde goodes, certes it is a ful
greet folye a man to priden hym in any of hem alle.  
<span id="an_457"></span> Now as for to speken of goodes of nature,  
<span id="an_457A"></span> God woot that somtyme we han hem in nature as
muche to oure damage as to oure profit.  
<span id="an_458"></span> As for to speken of heele of body, certes it
passeth ful lightly,  
<span id="an_458A"></span> and eek it is ful ofte enchesoun of the
siknesse of oure soule.  
<span id="an_458B"></span> For, God woot, the flessh is a ful greet
enemy to the soule,  
<span id="an_458C"></span> and therfore, the moore that the body is
hool, the moore be we in peril to falle.  
<span id="an_459"></span> Eke for to pride hym in his strengthe of body,
it is an heigh folye.  
<span id="an_459A"></span> For certes, the flessh coveiteth agayn the
spirit, and ay the moore strong that the flessh is, the sorier may the
soule be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> And over al
this, strengthe of body and worldly hardynesse causeth ful ofte many a
man to peril and meschaunce.  
<span id="an_461"></span> Eek for to pride hym of his gentrie is ful
greet folie; for  
<span id="an_461A"></span> ofte tyme the gentrie of the body binymeth
the gentrie of the soule;  
<span id="an_461B"></span> and eek we ben alle of o fader and of o
mooder;  
<span id="an_461C"></span> and alle we been of o nature, roten and
corrupt, bothe riche and povre.  
<span id="an_462"></span> For sothe, o manere gentrie is for to preise,
that apparailleth mannes corage with vertues and moralitees, and maketh
hym Cristes child.  
<span id="an_463"></span> For truste wel that over what man that synne
hath maistrie, he is a verray cherl to synne.  
<span id="an_464"></span> Now been ther generale signes of gentillesse,
as eschewynge of vice and ribaudye and servage of synne, in word, in
werk, and contenaunce,  
<span id="an_465"></span> and usynge vertu, curteisye, and clennesse,
and to be liberal --  
<span id="an_465A"></span> that is to seyn, large by mesure, for thilke
that passeth mesure is folie and synne.  
<span id="an_466"></span> Another is to remembre hym of bountee that he
of oother folk hath receyved.  
<span id="an_467"></span> Another is to be benigne to his goode
subgetis; wherfore seith Senek,  
<span id="an_467A"></span> "Ther is no thing moore covenable to a man of
heigh estaat than debonairetee and pitee.  
<span id="an_468"></span> And therfore thise flyes that men clepen bees,
whan they maken hir kyng,  
<span id="an_468A"></span> they chesen oon that hath no prikke wherwith
he may stynge."  
<span id="an_469"></span> Another is, a man to have a noble herte and a
diligent to attayne to heighe vertuouse thynges.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> Now certes, a
man to pride hym in the goodes of grace is eek an outrageous folie, for
thilke  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470A">470A</span></span> yifte of
grace that sholde have turned hym to goodnesse and to medicine, turneth
hym to venym and to confusioun, as seith Seint Gregorie.  
<span id="an_471"></span> Certes also, whoso prideth hym in the goodes
of fortune, he is a ful greet fool;  
<span id="an_471A"></span> for somtyme is a man a greet lord by the
morwe, that is a caytyf and a wrecche er it be nyght;  
<span id="an_472"></span> and somtyme the richesse of a man is cause of
his deth;  
<span id="an_472A"></span> somtyme the delices of a man ben cause of the
grevous maladye thurgh which he dyeth.  
<span id="an_473"></span> Certes, the commendacioun of the peple is
somtyme ful fals and ful brotel for to triste; this day they preyse,
tomorwe they blame.  
<span id="an_474"></span> God woot, desir to have commendacioun eek of
the peple hath caused deeth to many a bisy man.  
<span id="an_475"></span> Now sith that so is that ye han understonde
what is Pride,  
<span id="an_475A"></span> and whiche been the speces of it, and whennes
Pride sourdeth and spryngeth,  
<span id="an_476"></span> now shul ye understonde which is the remedie
agayns the synne of Pride; and that is humylitee, or mekenesse.  
<span id="an_477"></span> That is a vertu thurgh which a man hath verray
knoweleche of hymself, and holdeth of hymself no pris ne deyntee,  
<span id="an_477A"></span> as in regard of his desertes, considerynge
evere his freletee.  
<span id="an_478"></span> Now been ther three maneres of humylitee: as
humylitee in herte; another humylitee is in his mouth; the thridde in
his werkes.  
<span id="an_479"></span> The humilitee in herte is in foure maneres.
That oon is whan a man holdeth hymself as noght worth biforn God of
hevene.  
<span id="an_479A"></span> Another is whan he ne despiseth noon oother
man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_480">480</span></span> The thridde
is whan he rekketh nat, though men holde hym noght worth. The ferthe is
whan he nys nat sory of his humiliacioun.  
<span id="an_481"></span> Also the humilitee of mouth is in foure
thynges:  
<span id="an_481A"></span> in attempree speche, and in humblesse of
speche, and whan he biknoweth with his owene mouth  
<span id="an_481B"></span> that he is swich as hym thynketh that he is
in his herte.  
<span id="an_481C"></span> Another is whan he preiseth the bountee of
another man, and nothyng therof amenuseth.  
<span id="an_482"></span> Humilitee eek in werkes is in foure maneres.
The firste is whan he putteth othere men biforn hym.  
<span id="an_482A"></span> The seconde is to chese the loweste place
over al. The thridde is gladly to assente to good conseil.  
<span id="an_483"></span> The ferthe is to stonde gladly to the award of
his sovereyns,  
<span id="an_483A"></span> or of hym that is in hyer degree. Certein,
this is a greet werk of humylitee.  
<span id="an_484"></span> After Pride wol I speken of the foule synne of
Envye, which that is, as by the word of the Philosophre,  
<span id="an_484A"></span> "sorwe of oother mannes prosperitee"; and
after the word of Seint Augustyn, it is "Sorwe  
<span id="an_484B"></span> of oother mennes wele, and joye of othere
mennes harm."  
<span id="an_485"></span> This foule synne is platly agayns the Hooly
Goost. Al be it so that every synne is agayns the Hooly Goost,  
<span id="an_485A"></span> yet nathelees, for as muche as bountee
aperteneth proprely to the Hooly Goost, and Envye comth proprely of
malice,  
<span id="an_485B"></span> therfore it is proprely agayn the bountee of
the Hooly Goost.  
<span id="an_486"></span> Now hath malice two speces; that is to seyn,
hardnesse of herte in wikkednesse,  
<span id="an_486A"></span> or elles the flessh of man is so blynd that
he considereth nat that he is in synne  
<span id="an_486B"></span> or rekketh nat that he is in synne, which is
the hardnesse of the devel.  
<span id="an_487"></span> That oother spece of malice is whan a man
werreyeth trouthe, whan he woot that it is trouthe;  
<span id="an_487A"></span> and eek whan he werreyeth the grace that God
hath yeve to his neighebor; and al this is by Envye.  
<span id="an_488"></span> Certes, thanne is Envye the worste synne that
is. For soothly, alle othere synnes been somtyme oonly agayns o special
vertu,  
<span id="an_489"></span> but certes Envye is agayns alle vertues and
agayns alle goodnesses.  
<span id="an_489A"></span> For it is sory of alle the bountees of his
neighebor, and in this manere it is divers from alle othere synnes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> For wel
unnethe is ther any synne that it ne hath som delit in itself,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490A">490A</span></span> save oonly
Envye, that evere hath in itself angwissh and sorwe.  
<span id="an_491"></span> The speces of Envye been thise. Ther is first,
sorwe of oother mannes goodnesse and of his prosperitee;  
<span id="an_491A"></span> and prosperitee is kyndely matere of joye;
thanne is Envye a synne agayns kynde.  
<span id="an_492"></span> The seconde spece of Envye is joye of oother
mannes harm,  
<span id="an_492A"></span> and that is proprely lyk to the devel, that
evere rejoyseth hym of mannes harm.  
<span id="an_493"></span> Of thise two speces comth bakbityng; and this
synne of bakbityng or detraccion hath certeine speces, as thus:  
<span id="an_493A"></span> Som man preiseth his neighebor by a wikked
entente,  
<span id="an_494"></span> for he maketh alwey a wikked knotte atte laste
ende. Alwey he maketh a "but" atte laste ende,  
<span id="an_494A"></span> that is digne of moore blame than worth is al
the preisynge.  
<span id="an_495"></span> The seconde spece is that if a man be good and
dooth or seith a thing to good entente,  
<span id="an_495A"></span> the bakbitere wol turne al thilke goodnesse
up-so-doun to his shrewed entente.  
<span id="an_496"></span> The thridde is to amenuse the bountee of his
neighebor.  
<span id="an_497"></span> The fourthe spece of bakbityng is this: that
if men speke goodnesse of a man, thanne wol the bakbitere seyn,  
<span id="an_497A"></span> "Parfey, swich a man is yet bet than he," in
dispreisynge of hym that men preise.  
<span id="an_498"></span> The fifte spece is this: for to consente
gladly and herkne gladly to the harm that men speke of oother folk.  
<span id="an_498A"></span> This synne is ful greet and ay encreesseth
after the wikked entente of the bakbitere.  
<span id="an_499"></span> After bakbityng cometh gruchchyng or
murmuracioun; and somtyme it spryngeth of inpacience agayns God, and
somtyme agayns man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500">500</span></span> Agayn God it
is whan a man gruccheth agayn the peyne of helle, or agayns poverte, or
los of catel,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_500A">500A</span></span> or agayn
reyn or tempest; or elles gruccheth that shrewes han prosperitee, or
elles for that goode men han adversitee.  
<span id="an_501"></span> And alle thise thynges sholde man suffre
paciently, for they comen by the rightful juggement and ordinaunce of
God.  
<span id="an_502"></span> Somtyme comth grucching of avarice;  
<span id="an_502A"></span> as Judas grucched agayns the Magdaleyne whan
she enoynted the heved of oure Lord Jhesu Crist with hir precious
oynement.  
<span id="an_503"></span> This manere murmure is swich as whan man
gruccheth of goodnesse that hymself dooth, or that oother folk doon of
hir owene catel.  
<span id="an_504"></span> Somtyme comth murmure of Pride, as whan Simon
the Pharisee gruchched agayn the Magdaleyne  
<span id="an_504A"></span> whan she approched to Jhesu Crist and weep at
his feet for hire synnes.  
<span id="an_505"></span> And somtyme grucchyng sourdeth of Envye, whan
men discovereth a mannes harm that was pryvee or  
<span id="an_505A"></span> bereth hym on hond thyng that is fals.  
<span id="an_506"></span> Murmure eek is ofte amonges servauntz that
grucchen whan hir sovereyns bidden hem doon leveful thynges;  
<span id="an_507"></span> and forasmuche as they dar nat openly withseye
the comaundementz of hir sovereyns,  
<span id="an_507A"></span> yet wol they seyn harm, and grucche, and
murmure prively for verray despit;  
<span id="an_508"></span> whiche wordes men clepen the develes Pater
noster, though so be that the devel ne hadde nevere Pater noster,  
<span id="an_508A"></span> but that lewed folk yeven it swich a name.  
<span id="an_509"></span> Somtyme it comth of Ire or prive hate that
norisseth rancour in herte, as afterward I shal declare.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_510">510</span></span> Thanne cometh
eek bitternesse of herte, thurgh which bitternesse every good dede of
his neighebor semeth to hym bitter and unsavory.  
<span id="an_511"></span> Thanne cometh discord that unbyndeth alle
manere of freendshipe. Thanne comth scornynge of his neighebor, al do he
never so weel.  
<span id="an_512"></span> Thanne comth accusynge, as whan man seketh
occasioun to anoyen his neighebor,  
<span id="an_512A"></span> which that is lyk the craft of the devel,
that waiteth bothe nyght and day to accusen us alle.  
<span id="an_513"></span> Thanne comth malignitee, thurgh which a man
anoyeth his neighebor prively, if he may;  
<span id="an_514"></span> and if he noght may, algate his wikked wil ne
shal nat wante,  
<span id="an_514A"></span> as for to brennen his hous pryvely, or
empoysone or sleen his beestes, and semblable thynges.  
<span id="an_515"></span> Now wol I speke of remedie agayns this foule
synne of Envye. First is the love of God principal  
<span id="an_515A"></span> and lovyng of his neighebor as hymself, for
soothly that oon ne may nat been withoute that oother.  
<span id="an_516"></span> And truste wel that in the name of thy
neighebor thou shalt understonde the name of thy brother;  
<span id="an_516A"></span> for certes alle we have o fader flesshly and
o mooder -- that is to seyn, Adam and Eve --  
<span id="an_516B"></span> and eek o fader espiritueel, and that is God
of hevene.  
<span id="an_517"></span> Thy neighebor artow holden for to love and
wilne hym alle goodnesse; and therfore seith God,  
<span id="an_517A"></span> "Love thy neighebor as thyselve" -- that is
to seyn, to salvacioun bothe of lyf and of soule.  
<span id="an_518"></span> And mooreover thou shalt love hym in word, and
in benigne amonestynge and chastisynge,  
<span id="an_518A"></span> and conforten hym in his anoyes, and preye
for hym with al thyn herte.  
<span id="an_519"></span> And in dede thou shalt love hym in swich wise
that thou shalt doon to hym in charitee  
<span id="an_519A"></span> as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn
owene persone.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> And therfore
thou ne shalt doon hym no damage in wikked word, ne harm in his body,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520A">520A</span></span> ne in his
catel, ne in his soule, by entissyng of wikked ensample.  
<span id="an_521"></span> Thou shalt nat desiren his wyf ne none of his
thynges. Understoond eek that in the name of neighebor is comprehended
his enemy.  
<span id="an_522"></span> Certes, man shal loven his enemy, by the
comandement of God; and soothly thy freend shaltow love in God.  
<span id="an_523"></span> I seye, thyn enemy shaltow love for Goddes
sake, by his commandement.  
<span id="an_523A"></span> For if it were reson that man sholde haten
his enemy,  
<span id="an_523B"></span> for sothe God nolde nat receyven us to his
love that been his enemys.  
<span id="an_524"></span> Agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy
dooth to hym, he shal doon three thynges, as thus:  
<span id="an_525"></span> Agayns hate and rancour of herte, he shal love
hym in herte.  
<span id="an_525A"></span> Agayns chidyng and wikkede wordes, he shal
preye for his enemy. Agayns the wikked dede of his enemy, he shal doon
hym bountee.  
<span id="an_526"></span> For Crist seith, "Loveth youre enemys, and
preyeth for hem that speke yow harm, and eek for hem that yow chacen and
pursewen,  
<span id="an_526A"></span> and dooth bountee to hem that yow haten."
Loo, thus comaundeth us oure Lord Jhesu Crist to do to oure enemys.  
<span id="an_527"></span> For soothly, nature dryveth us to loven oure
freendes, and parfey, oure enemys han moore nede to love than oure
freendes;  
<span id="an_527A"></span> and they that moore nede have, certes to hem
shal men doon goodnesse;  
<span id="an_528"></span> and certes, in thilke dede have we
remembraunce of the love of Jhesu Crist that deyde for his enemys.  
<span id="an_529"></span> And in as muche as thilke love is the moore
grevous to parfourne, so muche is the moore gret the merite;  
<span id="an_529A"></span> and therfore the lovynge of oure enemy hath
confounded the venym of the devel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_530">530</span></span> For right as
the devel is disconfited by humylitee, right so is he wounded to the
deeth by love of oure enemy.  
<span id="an_531"></span> Certes, thanne is love the medicine that
casteth out the venym of Envye fro mannes herte.  
<span id="an_532"></span> The speces of this paas shullen be moore
largely declared in hir chapitres folwynge.  
<span id="an_533"></span> After Envye wol I discryven the synne of Ire.
For soothly, whoso hath envye upon his neighebor,  
<span id="an_533A"></span> anon he wole comunly fynde hym a matere of
wratthe, in word or in dede, agayns hym to whom he hath envye.  
<span id="an_534"></span> And as wel comth Ire of Pride as of Envye, for
soothly he that is proud or envyous is lightly wrooth.  
<span id="an_535"></span> This synne of Ire, after the discryvyng of
Seint Augustyn, is wikked wil to been avenged by word or by dede.  
<span id="an_536"></span> Ire, after the Philosophre, is the fervent
blood of man yquyked in his herte,  
<span id="an_536A"></span> thurgh which he wole harm to hym that he
hateth.  
<span id="an_537"></span> For certes, the herte of man, by eschawfynge
and moevynge of his blood, wexeth  
<span id="an_537A"></span> so trouble that he is out of alle juggement
of resoun.  
<span id="an_538"></span> But ye shal understonde that Ire is in two
maneres; that oon of hem is good, and that oother is wikked.  
<span id="an_539"></span> The goode Ire is by jalousie of goodnesse,  
<span id="an_539A"></span> thurgh which a man is wrooth with wikkednesse
and agayns wikkednesse; and therfore seith a wys man that Ire is bet
than pley.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> This Ire is
with debonairetee, and it is wrooth withouten bitternesse; nat wrooth
agayns the man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540A">540A</span></span> but wrooth
with the mysdede of the man, as seith the prophete David, "Irascimini et
nolite peccare."  
<span id="an_541"></span> Now understondeth that wikked Ire is in two
maneres;  
<span id="an_541A"></span> that is to seyn, sodeyn Ire or hastif Ire,
withouten avisement and consentynge of resoun.  
<span id="an_542"></span> The menyng and the sens of this is that the
resoun of a man ne consente nat to thilke sodeyn Ire,  
<span id="an_542A"></span> and thanne is it venial.  
<span id="an_543"></span> Another Ire is ful wikked, that comth of
felonie of herte avysed and cast biforn, with wikked wil to do
vengeance,  
<span id="an_543A"></span> and therto his resoun consenteth. and soothly
this is deedly synne.  
<span id="an_544"></span> This Ire is so displesant to God that it
troubleth his hous and chaceth the Hooly Goost out of mannes soule,  
<span id="an_544A"></span> and wasteth and destroyeth the liknesse of
God -- that is to seyn, the vertu that is in mannes soule --  
<span id="an_545"></span> and put in hym the liknesse of the devel, and
bynymeth the man fro God, that is his rightful lord.  
<span id="an_546"></span> This Ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the
devel,  
<span id="an_546A"></span> for it is the develes fourneys, that is
eschawfed with the fir of helle.  
<span id="an_547"></span> For certes, right so as fir is moore mighty to
destroyen erthely thynges than any oother element,  
<span id="an_547A"></span> right so Ire is myghty to destroyen alle
spiritueel thynges.  
<span id="an_548"></span> Looke how that fir of smale gleedes that been
almost dede under asshen wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with
brymstoon;  
<span id="an_548A"></span> right so Ire wol everemo quyken agayn whan it
is touched by the pride that is covered in mannes herte.  
<span id="an_549"></span> For certes, fir ne may nat comen out of no
thyng, but if it were first in the same thyng natureelly,  
<span id="an_549A"></span> as fir is drawen out of flyntes with steel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> And right so
as pride is ofte tyme matere of Ire, right so is rancour norice and
kepere of Ire.  
<span id="an_551"></span> Ther is a maner tree, as seith Seint Ysidre,
that whan men maken fir of thilke tree  
<span id="an_551A"></span> and covere the coles of it with asshen,
soothly the fir of it wol lasten al a yeer or moore.  
<span id="an_552"></span> And right so fareth it of rancour; whan it is
ones conceyved in the hertes of som men,  
<span id="an_552A"></span> certein, it wol lasten peraventure from oon
Estre day unto another Estre day, and moore.  
<span id="an_553"></span> But certes, thilke man is ful fer fro the
mercy of God al thilke while.  
<span id="an_554"></span> In this forseyde develes fourneys ther forgen
three shrewes: Pride, that ay bloweth and encreesseth the fir by
chidynge and wikked wordes;  
<span id="an_555"></span> thanne stant Envye and holdeth the hoote iren
upon the herte of man with a peire of longe toonges of long rancour;  
<span id="an_556"></span> and thanne stant the synne of Contumelie, or
strif and cheeste, and batereth and forgeth by vileyns reprevynges.  
<span id="an_557"></span> Certes, this cursed synne anoyeth bothe to the
man hymself and eek to his neighebor.  
<span id="an_557A"></span> For soothly, almoost al the harm that any man
dooth to his neighebor comth of wratthe.  
<span id="an_558"></span> For certes, outrageous wratthe dooth al that
evere the devel hym comaundeth, for he ne spareth neither Crist ne his
sweete Mooder.  
<span id="an_559"></span> And in his outrageous anger and ire -- allas,
allas! --  
<span id="an_559A"></span> ful many oon at that tyme feeleth in his
herte ful wikkedly, bothe of Crist and eek of alle his halwes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560">560</span></span> Is nat this a
cursed vice? Yis, certes. Allas! It bynymeth from man his wit and his
resoun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_560A">560A</span></span> and al his
debonaire lif espiritueel that sholde kepen his soule.  
<span id="an_561"></span> Certes, it bynymeth eek Goddes due lordshipe,
and that is mannes soule and the love of his neighebores.  
<span id="an_561A"></span> It stryveth eek alday agayn trouthe. It
reveth hym the quiete of his herte and subverteth his soule.  
<span id="an_562"></span> Of Ire comen thise stynkynge engendrures:
First, hate, that is oold wratthe;  
<span id="an_562A"></span> discord, thurgh which a man forsaketh his
olde freend that he hath loved ful longe;  
<span id="an_563"></span> and thanne cometh werre and every manere of
wrong that man dooth to his neighebor, in body or in catel.  
<span id="an_564"></span> Of this cursed synne of Ire cometh eek
manslaughtre. And understonde wel that homycide, that is manslaughtre,
is in diverse wise.  
<span id="an_564A"></span> Som manere of homycide is spiritueel, and som
is bodily.  
<span id="an_565"></span> Spiritueel manslaughtre is in sixe thynges.
First by hate, as seith Seint John: "He that hateth his brother is an
homycide."  
<span id="an_566"></span> Homycide is eek by bakbitynge, of whiche
bakbiteres seith Salomon that "they han two swerdes with whiche they
sleen hire neighebores."  
<span id="an_566A"></span> For soothly, as wikke is to bynyme his good
name as his lyf.  
<span id="an_567"></span> Homycide is eek in yevynge of wikked conseil
by fraude, as for to yeven conseil to areysen wrongful custumes and
taillages.  
<span id="an_568"></span> Of whiche seith Salomon, "Leon rorynge and
bere hongry been like to the cruel lordshipes" in withholdynge or
abreggynge of the shepe  
<span id="an_568A"></span> (or the hyre), or of the wages of servauntz,
or elles in usure, or in withdrawynge of the almesse of povre folk.  
<span id="an_569"></span> For which the wise man seith, "Fedeth hym that
almoost dyeth for honger"; for soothly, but if thow feede hym, thou
sleest hym;  
<span id="an_569A"></span> and alle thise been deedly synnes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570">570</span></span> Bodily
manslaughtre is, whan thow sleest him with thy tonge in oother manere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_570A">570A</span></span> as whan
thou comandest to sleen a man or elles yevest hym conseil to sleen a
man.  
<span id="an_571"></span> Manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres.  
<span id="an_571A"></span> That oon is by lawe, right as a justice
dampneth hym that is coupable to the deeth.  
<span id="an_571B"></span> But lat the justice be war that he do it
rightfully, and  
<span id="an_571C"></span> that he do it nat for delit to spille blood
but for kepynge of rightwisnesse.  
<span id="an_572"></span> Another homycide is that is doon for
necessitee, as whan o man sleeth another in his defendaunt  
<span id="an_572A"></span> and that he ne may noon ootherwise escape
from his owene deeth.  
<span id="an_573"></span> But certeinly if he may escape withouten
slaughtre of his adversarie, and sleeth hym,  
<span id="an_573A"></span> he dooth synne and he shal bere penance as
for deedly synne.  
<span id="an_574"></span> Eek if a man, by caas or aventure, shete an
arwe,  
<span id="an_574A"></span> or caste a stoon with which he sleeth a man,
he is homycide.  
<span id="an_575"></span> Eek if a womman by necligence overlyeth hire
child in hir slepyng, it is homycide and deedly synne.  
<span id="an_576"></span> Eek whan man destourbeth concepcioun of a
child, and maketh a womman outher bareyne  
<span id="an_576A"></span> by drynkynge venenouse herbes thurgh which
she may nat conceyve,  
<span id="an_576B"></span> or sleeth a child by drynkes wilfully, or
elles putteth certeine material thynges in hire secree places to slee
the child,  
<span id="an_577"></span> or elles dooth unkyndely synne, by which man
or womman shedeth hire nature in manere or in place  
<span id="an_577A"></span> ther as a child may nat be conceived, or
elles if a woman have conceyved,  
<span id="an_577B"></span> and hurt hirself and sleeth the child, yet is
it homycide.  
<span id="an_578"></span> What seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir
children for drede of worldly shame? Certes, an horrible homicide.  
<span id="an_579"></span> Homycide is eek if a man approcheth to a
womman by desir of lecherie, thurgh which the child is perissed,  
<span id="an_579A"></span> or elles smyteth a womman wityngly, thurgh
which she leseth hir child. Alle thise been homycides and horrible
deedly synnes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580">580</span></span> Yet comen
ther of Ire manye mo synnes, as wel in word as in thoght and in dede;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580A">580A</span></span> as he that
arretteth upon God, or blameth God of thyng of which he is hymself
gilty,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_580B">580B</span></span> or
despiseth God and alle his halwes, as doon thise cursede hasardours in
diverse contrees.  
<span id="an_581"></span> This cursed synne doon they, whan they feelen
in hir herte ful wikkedly of God and of his halwes.  
<span id="an_582"></span> Also whan they treten unreverently the
sacrement of the auter, thilke synne is so greet that unnethe may it
been releessed,  
<span id="an_582A"></span> but that the mercy of God passeth alle his
werkes; it is so greet, and he so benigne.  
<span id="an_583"></span> Thanne comth of Ire attry angre. Whan a man is
sharply amonested in his shrifte to forleten his synne,  
<span id="an_584"></span> thanne wole he be angry, and answeren hokerly
and angrily, and deffenden or excusen his synne by unstedefastnesse of
his flessh;  
<span id="an_584A"></span> or elles he dide it for to holde compaignye
with his felawes; or elles, he seith, the feend enticed hym;  
<span id="an_585"></span> or elles he dide it for his youthe; or elles
his compleccioun is so corageous that he may nat forbere;  
<span id="an_585A"></span> or elles it is his destinee, as he seith,
unto a certein  
<span id="an_585B"></span> age; or elles, he seith, it cometh hym of
gentillesse of his auncestres; and semblable thynges.  
<span id="an_586"></span> Alle thise manere of folk so wrappen hem in
hir synnes that they ne wol nat delivere hemself.  
<span id="an_586A"></span> For soothly, no wight that excuseth hym
wilfully of his synne  
<span id="an_586B"></span> may nat been delivered of his synne til that
he mekely biknoweth his synne.  
<span id="an_587"></span> After this, thanne cometh sweryng, that is
expres agayn the comandement of God; and this bifalleth ofte of anger
and of Ire.  
<span id="an_588"></span> God seith, "Thow shalt nat take the name of
thy Lord God in veyn or in ydel."  
<span id="an_588A"></span> Also oure Lord Jhesu Crist seith, by the word
of Seint Mathew,  
<span id="an_589"></span> "Ne wol ye nat swere in alle manere; neither
by hevene, for it is Goddes trone;  
<span id="an_589A"></span> ne by erthe, for it is the bench of his feet;
ne by Jerusalem, for it is the citee of a greet kyng;  
<span id="an_589B"></span> ne by thyn heed, for thou mayst nat make an
heer whit ne blak.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_590">590</span></span> But seyeth by
youre word \`ye, ye,' and \`nay, nay'; and what that is moore, it is of
yvel" -- thus seith Crist.  
<span id="an_591"></span> For Cristes sake, ne swereth nat so synfully
in dismembrynge of Crist by soule, herte, bones, and body.  
<span id="an_591A"></span> For certes, it semeth that ye thynke that the
cursede Jewes ne dismembred nat ynough the preciouse persone of Crist,  
<span id="an_591B"></span> but ye dismembre hym moore.  
<span id="an_592"></span> And if so be that the lawe compelle yow to
swere, thanne rule yow after the lawe of God in youre swerying,  
<span id="an_592A"></span> as seith Jeremye, quarto capitulo: Thou shalt
kepe three condicions: thou shalt swere "in trouthe, in doom, and in
rightwisnesse."  
<span id="an_593"></span> This is to seyn, thou shalt swere sooth, for
every lesynge is agayns Crist;  
<span id="an_593A"></span> for Crist is verray trouthe. And thynk wel
this: that "every greet swerere, nat compelled lawefully to  
<span id="an_593B"></span> swere, the wounde shal nat departe from his
hous" whil he useth swich unleveful swerying.  
<span id="an_594"></span> Thou shalt sweren eek in doom, whan thou art
constreyned by thy domesman to witnessen the trouthe.  
<span id="an_595"></span> Eek thow shalt nat swere for envye, ne for
favour, ne for meede, but for rightwisnesse, for declaracioun of it,  
<span id="an_595A"></span> to the worshipe of God and helpyng of thyne
evene-Cristene.  
<span id="an_596"></span> And therfore every man that taketh Goddes name
in ydel, or falsly swereth with his mouth,  
<span id="an_596A"></span> or elles taketh on hym the name of Crist, to
be called a Cristen man  
<span id="an_596B"></span> and lyveth agayns Cristes lyvynge and his
techynge, alle they taken Goddes name in ydel.  
<span id="an_597"></span> Looke eek what Seint Peter seith, Actuum
quarto, Non est aliud nomen sub celo, etc., "Ther nys noon oother name,"
seith Seint Peter,  
<span id="an_597A"></span> "under hevene yeven to men, in which they
mowe be saved"; that is to seyn, but the name of Jhesu Crist.  
<span id="an_598"></span> Take kep eek how precious is the name of
Crist, as seith Seint Paul, ad Philipenses secundo, In nomine Jhesu,
etc.,  
<span id="an_598A"></span> "That in the name of Jhesu every knee of
hevenely creatures, or erthely, or of helle sholde  
<span id="an_598B"></span> bowe," for it is so heigh and so worshipful
that the cursede feend in helle sholde tremblen to heeren it ynempned.  
<span id="an_599"></span> Thanne semeth it that men that sweren so
horribly by his blessed name,  
<span id="an_599A"></span> that they despise it moore booldely than dide
the cursede Jewes or elles the devel, that trembleth whan he heereth his
name.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_600">600</span></span> Now certes,
sith that sweryng, but if it be lawefully doon, is so heighly deffended,
muche worse is forsweryng falsly, and yet nedelees.  
<span id="an_601"></span> What seye we eek of hem that deliten hem in
sweryng,  
<span id="an_601A"></span> and holden it a gentrie or a manly dede to
swere grete othes?  
<span id="an_601B"></span> And what of hem that of verray usage ne cesse
nat to swere grete othes, al be the cause nat worth a straw?  
<span id="an_601C"></span> Certes, this is horrible synne.  
<span id="an_602"></span> Swerynge sodeynly withoute avysement is eek a
synne.  
<span id="an_603"></span> But lat us go now to thilke horrible sweryng
of adjuracioun and conjuracioun,  
<span id="an_603A"></span> as doon thise false enchauntours or
nigromanciens in bacyns ful of water,  
<span id="an_603B"></span> or in a bright swerd, in a cercle, or in a
fir, or in a shulder-boon of a sheep.  
<span id="an_604"></span> I kan nat seye but that they doon cursedly and
dampnably agayns Crist and al the feith of hooly chirche.  
<span id="an_605"></span> What seye we of hem that bileeven on
divynailes, as by flight or by noyse of briddes, or of beestes,  
<span id="an_605A"></span> or by sort, by nigromancie, by dremes, by
chirkynge of dores or crakkynge of houses, by gnawynge of rattes, and
swich manere wrecchednesse?  
<span id="an_606"></span> Certes, al this thyng is deffended by God and
by hooly chirche.  
<span id="an_606A"></span> For which they been acursed, til they come to
amendement, that on swich filthe setten hire bileeve.  
<span id="an_607"></span> Charmes for woundes or maladie of men or of
beestes, if they taken any effect,  
<span id="an_607A"></span> it may be peraventure that God suffreth it,
for folk sholden yeve the moore feith and reverence to his name.  
<span id="an_608"></span> Now wol I speken of lesynges, which generally
is fals signyficaunce of word, in entente to deceyven his
evene-Cristene.  
<span id="an_609"></span> Som lesynge is of which ther comth noon
avantage to no wight;  
<span id="an_609A"></span> and som lesynge turneth to the ese and profit
of o man, and to disese and damage of another man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610">610</span></span> Another
lesynge is for to saven his lyf or his catel. Another  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610A">610A</span></span> lesynge
comth of delit for to lye, in which delit they wol forge a long tale  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_610B">610B</span></span> and peynten
it with alle circumstaunces, where al the ground of the tale is fals.  
<span id="an_611"></span> Som lesynge comth for he wole sustene his
word; and som lesynge comth of reccheleesnesse withouten avisement; and
semblable thynges.  
<span id="an_612"></span> Lat us now touche the vice of flaterynge,
which ne comth nat gladly but for drede or for coveitise.  
<span id="an_613"></span> Flaterye is generally wrongful preisynge.
Flatereres been the develes norices, that norissen his children with
milk of losengerie.  
<span id="an_614"></span> For sothe, Salomon seith that "Flaterie is
wors than detraccioun." For somtyme detraccion maketh an hauteyn man be
the moore humble,  
<span id="an_614A"></span> for he dredeth detraccion; but certes
flaterye, that maketh a man to enhauncen his herte and his
contenaunce.  
<span id="an_615"></span> Flatereres been the develes enchauntours; for
they make a man to wene of hymself be lyk that he nys nat lyk.  
<span id="an_616"></span> They been lyk to Judas that bitraysen a man to
sellen hym to his enemy; that is to the devel.  
<span id="an_617"></span> Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that
syngen evere Placebo.  
<span id="an_618"></span> I rekene flaterie in the vices of Ire,  
<span id="an_618A"></span> for ofte tyme if o man be wrooth with
another, thanne wole he flatere som wight to sustene hym in his
querele.  
<span id="an_619"></span> Speke we now of swich cursynge as comth of
irous herte. Malisoun generally may be seyd every maner power of harm.  
<span id="an_619A"></span> Swich cursynge bireveth man fro the regne of
God, as seith Seint Paul.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_620">620</span></span> And ofte tyme
swich cursynge wrongfully retorneth agayn to hym that curseth, as a bryd
that retorneth agayn to his owene nest.  
<span id="an_621"></span> And over alle thyng men oghten eschewe to
cursen hire children, and yeven to the devel hire engendrure,  
<span id="an_621A"></span> as ferforth as in hem is. Certes, it is greet
peril and greet synne.  
<span id="an_622"></span> Lat us thanne speken of chidynge and reproche,
whiche been ful grete woundes in mannes herte,  
<span id="an_622A"></span> for they unsowen the semes of freendshipe in
mannes herte.  
<span id="an_623"></span> For certes, unnethes may a man pleynly been
accorded with hym that hath hym openly revyled and repreved and
disclaundred.  
<span id="an_623A"></span> This is a ful grisly synne, as Crist seith in
the gospel.  
<span id="an_624"></span> And taak kep now, that he that repreveth his
neighebor, outher he repreveth hym by som harm of peyne  
<span id="an_624A"></span> that he hath on his body, as "mesel," "croked
harlot," or by som synne that he dooth.  
<span id="an_625"></span> Now if he repreve hym by harm of peyne, thanne
turneth the repreve to Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_625A"></span> for peyne is sent by the rightwys sonde of
God, and by his suffrance, be it meselrie, or maheym, or maladie.  
<span id="an_626"></span> And if he repreve hym uncharitably of synne,
as "thou holour," "thou dronkelewe harlot," and so forth,  
<span id="an_626A"></span> thanne aperteneth that to the rejoysynge of
the devel, that evere hath joye that men doon synne.  
<span id="an_627"></span> And certes, chidynge may nat come but out of a
vileyns herte.  
<span id="an_627A"></span> For after the habundance of the herte speketh
the mouth ful ofte.  
<span id="an_628"></span> And ye shul understonde that looke, by any
wey,  
<span id="an_628A"></span> whan any man shal chastise another, that he
be war from chidynge or reprevynge.  
<span id="an_628B"></span> For trewely, but he be war, he may ful
lightly quyken the fir of angre and of wratthe,  
<span id="an_628C"></span> which that he sholde quenche, and peraventure
sleeth hym which that he myghte chastise with benignitee.  
<span id="an_629"></span> For as seith Salomon, "The amyable tonge is
the tree of lyf" -- that is to seyn, of lyf espiritueel --  
<span id="an_629A"></span> and soothly, a deslavee tonge sleeth the
spirites of hym that repreveth and eek of hym that is repreved.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> Loo, what
seith Seint Augustyn: "Ther is nothyng so lyk the develes child as he
that ofte chideth."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630A">630A</span></span> Seint Paul
seith eek, "The servant of God bihoveth nat to chide."  
<span id="an_631"></span> And how that chidynge be a vileyns thyng
bitwixe alle manere folk,  
<span id="an_631A"></span> yet is it certes moost uncovenable bitwixe a
man and his wyf,  
<span id="an_631B"></span> for there is nevere reste. And therfore seith
Salomon, "An  
<span id="an_631C"></span> hous that is uncovered and droppynge and a
chidynge wyf been lyke."  
<span id="an_632"></span> A man that is in a droppynge hous in manye
places,  
<span id="an_632A"></span> though he eschewe the droppynge in o place,
it droppeth on hym in another place.  
<span id="an_632B"></span> So fareth it by a chydynge wyf; but she chide
hym in o place, she wol chide hym in another.  
<span id="an_633"></span> And therfore, "Bettre is a morsel of breed
with joye than an hous ful of delices with chidynge," seith Salomon.  
<span id="an_634"></span> Seint Paul seith, "O ye wommen, be ye subgetes
to youre housbondes as bihoveth in God,  
<span id="an_634A"></span> and ye men loveth youre wyves." Ad
Colossenses tertio.  
<span id="an_635"></span> Afterward speke we of scornynge, which is a
wikked synne, and namely whan he scorneth a man for his goode werkes.  
<span id="an_636"></span> For certes, swiche scorneres faren lyk the
foule  
<span id="an_636A"></span> tode, that may nat endure to smelle the soote
savour of the vyne whanne it florissheth.  
<span id="an_637"></span> Thise scorneres been partyng felawes with the
devel; for they han joye whan the devel wynneth and sorwe whan he
leseth.  
<span id="an_638"></span> They been adversaries of Jhesu Crist, for they
haten that he loveth -- that is to seyn, salvacioun of soule.  
<span id="an_639"></span> Speke we now of wikked conseil, for he that
wikked conseil yeveth is a traytour.  
<span id="an_639A"></span> For he deceyveth hym that trusteth in hym, ut
Achitofel ad Absolonem. But nathelees, yet is his wikked conseil first
agayn hymself.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> For, as seith
the wise man, "Every fals lyvynge hath this propertee in hymself, that  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640A">640A</span></span> he that
wole anoye another man, he anoyeth first hymself."  
<span id="an_641"></span> And men shul understonde that man shal nat
taken his conseil of fals folk, ne of angry folk, or grevous folk,  
<span id="an_641A"></span> ne of folk that loven specially to muchel hir
owene profit, ne to muche worldly folk, namely in conseilynge of
soules.  
<span id="an_642"></span> Now comth the synne of hem that sowen and
maken discord amonges folk, which is a synne that Crist hateth
outrely.  
<span id="an_642A"></span> And no wonder is, for he deyde for to make
concord.  
<span id="an_643"></span> And moore shame do they to Crist than dide
they that hym crucifiede,  
<span id="an_643A"></span> for God loveth bettre that freendshipe be
amonges folk, than he dide his owene body,  
<span id="an_643B"></span> the which that he yaf for unitee. Therfore
been they likned to the devel, that evere is aboute to maken discord.  
<span id="an_644"></span> Now comth the synne of double tonge, swiche as
speken faire byforn folk and wikkedly bihynde, or elles they maken
semblant  
<span id="an_644A"></span> as though they speeke of good entencioun, or
elles in game and pley, and yet they speke of wikked entente.  
<span id="an_645"></span> Now comth biwreying of conseil, thurgh which a
man is defamed; certes, unnethe may he restoore the damage.  
<span id="an_646"></span> Now comth manace, that is an open folye, for
he that ofte manaceth, he threteth moore than he may parfourne ful ofte
tyme.  
<span id="an_647"></span> Now cometh ydel wordes, that is withouten
profit of hym that speketh tho wordes,  
<span id="an_647A"></span> and eek of hym that herkneth tho wordes. Or
elles ydel wordes been tho that been nedelees or withouten entente of
natureel profit.  
<span id="an_648"></span> And al be it that ydel wordes been somtyme
venial synne,  
<span id="an_648A"></span> yet sholde men douten hem, for we shul yeve
rekenynge of hem bifore God.  
<span id="an_649"></span> Now comth janglynge, that may nat been
withoute synne. And, as seith Salomon, "It is a sygne of apert folye."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> And therfore
a philosophre seyde, whan men axed hym how that men sholde plese the
peple,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650A">650A</span></span> and he
answerde, "Do manye goode werkes, and spek fewe jangles."  
<span id="an_651"></span> After this comth the synne of japeres, that
been the develes apes,  
<span id="an_651A"></span> for they maken folk to laughe at hire japerie
as folk doon at the gawdes of an ape.  
<span id="an_651B"></span> Swiche japeres deffendeth Seint Paul.  
<span id="an_652"></span> Looke how that vertuouse wordes and hooly
conforten hem that travaillen in the service of Crist,  
<span id="an_652A"></span> right so conforten the vileyns wordes and
knakkes of japeris hem that travaillen in the service of the devel.  
<span id="an_653"></span> Thise been the synnes that comen of the tonge,
that comen of Ire and of othere synnes mo.  
<span id="an_654"></span> The remedie agayns Ire is a vertu that men
clepen mansuetude, that is debonairetee;  
<span id="an_654A"></span> and eek another vertu, that men callen
pacience or suffrance.  
<span id="an_655"></span> Debonairetee withdraweth and refreyneth the
stirynges and the moevynges of mannes corage in his herte,  
<span id="an_655A"></span> in swich manere that they ne skippe nat out
by angre ne by ire.  
<span id="an_656"></span> Suffrance suffreth swetely alle the anoyaunces
and the wronges that men doon to man outward.  
<span id="an_657"></span> Seint Jerome seith thus of debonairetee, that
"it dooth noon harm to no wight ne seith.  
<span id="an_657A"></span> ne for noon harm that men doon or seyn, he ne
eschawfeth nat agayns his resoun."  
<span id="an_658"></span> This vertu somtyme comth of nature, for, as
seith the Philosophre,  
<span id="an_658A"></span> "A man is a quyk thyng, by nature debonaire
and tretable to goodnesse;  
<span id="an_658B"></span> but whan debonairetee is enformed of grace,
thanne is it the moore worth."  
<span id="an_659"></span> Pacience, that is another remedie agayns Ire,
is a vertu that suffreth swetely every mannes goodnesse,  
<span id="an_659A"></span> and is nat wrooth for noon harm that is doon
to hym.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> The
Philosophre seith that pacience is thilke vertu that suffreth
debonairely alle the outrages of adversitee and every wikked word.  
<span id="an_661"></span> This vertu maketh a man lyk to God, and maketh
hym Goddes owene deere child, as seith Crist.  
<span id="an_661A"></span> This vertu disconfiteth thyn enemy. And
therfore seith the wise man, "If thow wolt venquysse thyn enemy, lerne
to suffre."  
<span id="an_662"></span> And thou shalt understonde that man suffreth
foure manere of grevances in outward thynges,  
<span id="an_662A"></span> agayns the whiche foure he moot have foure
manere of paciences.  
<span id="an_663"></span> The firste grevance is of wikkede wordes.
Thilke suffrede Jhesu Crist withouten grucchyng, ful paciently,  
<span id="an_663A"></span> whan the Jewes despised and repreved hym ful
ofte.  
<span id="an_664"></span> Suffre thou therfore paciently; for the wise
man seith, "If thou stryve with a fool,  
<span id="an_664A"></span> though the fool be wrooth or though he
laughe, algate thou shalt have no reste."  
<span id="an_665"></span> That oother grevance outward is to have damage
of thy catel. Theragayns suffred Crist ful paciently, whan  
<span id="an_665A"></span> he was despoyled of al that he hadde in this
lyf, and that nas but his clothes.  
<span id="an_666"></span> The thridde grevance is a man to have harm in
his body. That suffred Crist ful paciently in al his passioun.  
<span id="an_667"></span> The fourthe grevance is in outrageous labour
in werkes.  
<span id="an_667A"></span> Wherfore I seye that folk that maken hir
servantz to travaillen to grevously or out of tyme, as on haly dayes,  
<span id="an_667B"></span> soothly they do greet synne.  
<span id="an_668"></span> Heer-agayns suffred Crist ful paciently and
taughte us pacience, whan he baar upon his blissed shulder  
<span id="an_668A"></span> the croys upon which he sholde suffren
despitous deeth.  
<span id="an_669"></span> Heere may men lerne to be pacient, for certes
noght oonly Cristen men been pacient for love of Jhesu Crist  
<span id="an_669A"></span> and for gerdoun of the blisful lyf that is
perdurable, but  
<span id="an_669B"></span> certes, the olde payens that nevere were
Cristene commendeden and useden the vertu of pacience.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> A philosophre
upon a tyme, that wolde have beten his disciple for his grete trespas,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670A">670A</span></span> for which
he was greetly amoeved, and broghte a yerde to scoure with the child;  
<span id="an_671"></span> and whan this child saugh the yerde, he seyde
to his maister,  
<span id="an_671A"></span> "What thenke ye do?" "I wol bete thee," quod
the maister, "for thy correccioun."  
<span id="an_672"></span> "For sothe," quod the child, "ye oghten first
correcte youreself,  
<span id="an_672A"></span> that han lost al youre pacience for the gilt
of a child."  
<span id="an_673"></span> "For sothe," quod the maister al wepynge,
"thow seyst sooth. Have thow the yerde, my deere sone, and correcte me
for myn inpacience."  
<span id="an_674"></span> Of pacience comth obedience, thurgh which a
man is obedient to Crist and to alle hem  
<span id="an_674A"></span> to whiche he oghte to been obedient in
Crist.  
<span id="an_675"></span> And understond wel that obedience is parfit  
<span id="an_675A"></span> whan that a man dooth gladly and hastily,
with good herte entierly, al that he sholde do.  
<span id="an_676"></span> Obedience generally is to parfourne the
doctrine of God and of his sovereyns, to whiche hym oghte to ben
obeisaunt in alle rightwisnesse.  
<span id="an_677"></span> After the synne of Envye and of Ire, now wol I
speken of the synne of Accidie.  
<span id="an_677A"></span> For Envye blyndeth the herte of a man, and
Ire troubleth a man, and Accidie maketh hym hevy, thoghtful, and wraw.  
<span id="an_678"></span> Envye and Ire maken bitternesse in herte,
which bitternesse is mooder of Accidie, and bynymeth hym the love of
alle goodnesse.  
<span id="an_678A"></span> Thanne is Accidie the angwissh of troubled
herte; and Seint Augustyn seith, "It is anoy of goodnesse and joye of
harm."  
<span id="an_679"></span> Certes, this is a dampnable synne, for it
dooth wrong to Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_679B"></span> in as muche as it bynymeth the service that
men oghte doon to Crist with alle diligence, as seith Salomon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> But Accidie
dooth no swich diligence. He dooth alle thyng with anoy, and with
wrawnesse, slaknesse, and excusacioun, and with ydelnesse, and unlust;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680A">680A</span></span> for which
the book seith, "Acursed be he that dooth the service of God
necligently."  
<span id="an_681"></span> Thanne is Accidie enemy to everich estaat of
man, for certes the estaat of man is in three maneres.  
<span id="an_682"></span> Outher it is th' estaat of innocence, as was
th' estaat of Adam biforn that he fil into synne,  
<span id="an_682A"></span> in which estaat he was holden to wirche as in
heriynge and adowrynge of God.  
<span id="an_683"></span> Another estaat is the estaat of synful men, in
which estaat men been holden to laboure in preiynge to God  
<span id="an_683A"></span> for amendement of hire synnes, and that he
wole graunte hem to arysen out of hir synnes.  
<span id="an_684"></span> Another estaat is th' estaat of grace, in
which estaat he is holden to werkes of penitence.  
<span id="an_684A"></span> And certes, to alle thise thynges is Accidie
enemy and contrarie, for he loveth no bisynesse at al.  
<span id="an_685"></span> Now certes this foule synne Accidie is eek a
ful greet enemy to the liflode of the body,  
<span id="an_685A"></span> for it ne hath no purveaunce agayn temporeel
necessitee, for it forsleweth and forsluggeth and destroyeth alle goodes
temporeles by reccheleesnesse.  
<span id="an_686"></span> The fourthe thyng is that Accidie is lyk hem
that been in the peyne of helle, by cause of hir slouthe  
<span id="an_686A"></span> and of hire hevynesse, for they that been
dampned been so bounde that they ne may neither wel do ne wel thynke.  
<span id="an_687"></span> Of Accidie comth first that a man is anoyed
and encombred for to doon any goodnesse,  
<span id="an_687A"></span> and maketh that God hath abhomynacion of
swich Accidie, as seith Seint John.  
<span id="an_688"></span> Now comth Slouthe, that wol nat suffre noon
hardnesse ne no penaunce. For soothly, Slouthe is so tendre and so
delicaat,  
<span id="an_688A"></span> as seith Salomon, that he wol nat suffre noon
hardnesse ne penaunce, and therfore he shendeth al that he dooth.  
<span id="an_689"></span> Agayns this roten-herted synne of Accidie and
Slouthe sholde men exercise hemself to doon goode werkes, and manly  
<span id="an_689A"></span> and vertuously cacchen corage wel to doon,
thynkynge that oure Lord Jhesu Crist quiteth every good dede, be it
never so lite.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> Usage of
labour is a greet thyng, for it maketh, as seith Seint Bernard, the
laborer to have stronge armes and harde synwes;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690A">690A</span></span> and slouthe
maketh hem feble and tendre.  
<span id="an_691"></span> Thanne comth drede to bigynne to werke anye
goode werkes. For certes, he that is enclyned to synne,  
<span id="an_691A"></span> hym thynketh it is so greet an emprise for to
undertake to doon werkes of goodnesse,  
<span id="an_692"></span> and casteth in his herte that the
circumstaunces of goodnesse been so grevouse  
<span id="an_692A"></span> and so chargeaunt for to suffre, that he dar
nat undertake to do werkes of goodnesse, as seith Seint Gregorie.  
<span id="an_693"></span> Now comth wanhope, that is despeir of the
mercy of God, that comth somtyme of to muche outrageous sorwe,  
<span id="an_693A"></span> and somtyme of to muche drede, ymaginynge
that he hath doon so muche synne that it wol nat availlen hym,  
<span id="an_693B"></span> though he wolde repenten hym and forsake
synne,  
<span id="an_694"></span> thurgh which despeir or drede he abaundoneth
al his herte to every maner synne, as seith Seint Augustin.  
<span id="an_695"></span> Which dampnable synne, if that it continue
unto his ende, it is cleped synnyng in the Hooly Goost.  
<span id="an_696"></span> This horrible synne is so perilous that he
that is despeired,  
<span id="an_696A"></span> ther nys no felonye ne no synne that he
douteth for to do, as shewed wel by Judas.  
<span id="an_697"></span> Certes, aboven alle synnes thanne is this
synne moost displesant to Crist, and moost adversarie.  
<span id="an_698"></span> Soothly, he that despeireth hym is lyk the
coward champioun recreant, that seith "creant" withoute nede.  
<span id="an_698A"></span> Allas, allas, nedeles is he recreant and
nedelees despeired.  
<span id="an_699"></span> Certes, the mercy of God is evere redy to the
penitent, and is aboven alle his werkes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> Allas, kan a
man nat bithynke hym on the gospel of Seint Luc, 15,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700A">700A</span></span> where as
Crist seith that "as wel shal ther be joye in hevene upon a synful man
that dooth penitence,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700B">700B</span></span> as upon
nynty and nyne rightful men that neden no penitence."  
<span id="an_701"></span> Looke forther, in the same gospel, the joye
and the feeste of the goode man that hadde lost his sone,  
<span id="an_701A"></span> whan his sone with repentaunce was retourned
to his fader.  
<span id="an_702"></span> Kan they nat remembren hem eek that, as seith
Seint Luc, 23, how that the theef that was hanged bisyde Jhesu Crist
seyde,  
<span id="an_702A"></span> "Lord, remembre of me, whan thow comest into
thy regn."?  
<span id="an_703"></span> "For sothe," seyde Crist, "I seye to thee,
to-day shaltow been with me in paradys."  
<span id="an_704"></span> Certes, ther is noon so horrible synne of
man  
<span id="an_704A"></span> that it ne may in his lyf be destroyed by
penitence, thurgh vertu of the passion and of the deeth of Crist.  
<span id="an_705"></span> Allas, what nedeth man thanne to been
despeired, sith that his mercy so redy is and large? Axe and have.  
<span id="an_706"></span> Thanne cometh sompnolence, that is sloggy
slombrynge, which maketh a man be hevy and dul in body and in soule,  
<span id="an_706A"></span> and this synne comth of Slouthe.  
<span id="an_707"></span> And certes, the tyme that, by wey of resoun,
men sholde nat slepe, that is by the morwe,  
<span id="an_707A"></span> but if ther were cause resonable.  
<span id="an_708"></span> For soothly, the morwe tyde is moost covenable
a man to seye his preyeres, and for to thynken on God,  
<span id="an_708A"></span> and for to honoure God, and to yeven almesse
to the povre that first cometh in the name of Crist.  
<span id="an_709"></span> Lo, what seith Salomon: "Whoso wolde by the
morwe awaken and seke me, he shal fynde."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> Thanne cometh
necligence, or reccheleesnesse, that rekketh of no thyng.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710A">710A</span></span> And how
that ignoraunce be mooder of alle harm, certes, necligence is the
norice.  
<span id="an_711"></span> Necligence ne dooth no fors, whan he shal doon
a thyng, wheither he do it weel or baddely.  
<span id="an_712"></span> Of the remedie of thise two synnes, as seith
the wise man,  
<span id="an_712A"></span> that "He that dredeth God, he spareth nat to
doon that him oghte doon."  
<span id="an_713"></span> And he that loveth God, he wol doon diligence
to plese God by his werkes  
<span id="an_713A"></span> and abaundone hymself, with al his myght, wel
for to doon.  
<span id="an_714"></span> Thanne comth ydelnesse, that is the yate of
alle harmes. An ydel man is lyk to a place that hath no walles;  
<span id="an_714A"></span> the develes may entre on every syde, or
sheten at hym at discovert, by temptacion on every syde.  
<span id="an_715"></span> This ydelnesse is the thurrok of alle wikked
and vileyns thoghtes, and of alle jangles, trufles, and of alle
ordure.  
<span id="an_716"></span> Certes, the hevene is yeven to hem that wol
labouren, and nat to ydel folk. Eek David seith that  
<span id="an_716A"></span> "they ne been nat in the labour of men, ne
they shul nat been whipped with men"  
<span id="an_716B"></span> -- that is to seyn, in purgatorie.  
<span id="an_717"></span> Certes, thanne semeth it they shul be
tormented with the devel in helle, but if they doon penitence.  
<span id="an_718"></span> Thanne comth the synne that men clepen
tarditas, as whan a man is to laterede or tariynge er he wole turne to
God,  
<span id="an_718A"></span> and certes that is a greet folie. He is lyk
to hym that falleth in the dych and wol nat arise.  
<span id="an_719"></span> And this vice comth of a fals hope, that he
thynketh that he shal lyve longe; but that hope faileth ful ofte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720">720</span></span> Thanne comth
lachesse; that is he that whan he biginneth any good werk  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720A">720A</span></span> anon he
shal forleten it and stynten, as doon they that han any wight to
governe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720B">720B</span></span> and ne
taken of hym namoore kep anon as they fynden any contrarie or any
anoy.  
<span id="an_721"></span> Thise been the newe sheepherdes that leten hir
sheep wityngly go renne  
<span id="an_721A"></span> to the wolf that is in the breres, or do no
fors of hir owene governaunce.  
<span id="an_722"></span> Of this comth poverte and destruccioun, bothe
of spiritueel and temporeel thynges.  
<span id="an_722A"></span> Thanne comth a manere cooldnesse, that
freseth al the herte of a man.  
<span id="an_723"></span> Thanne comth undevocioun, thurgh which a man
is so blent, as seith Seint Bernard,  
<span id="an_723A"></span> and hath swich langour in soule that he may
neither rede ne singe in hooly chirche, ne heere ne thynke of no
devocioun,  
<span id="an_723B"></span> ne travaille with his handes in no good werk,
that it nys hym unsavory and al apalled.  
<span id="an_724"></span> Thanne wexeth he slough and slombry, and soone
wol be wrooth, and soone is enclyned to hate and to envye.  
<span id="an_725"></span> Thanne comth the synne of worldly sorwe, swich
as is cleped tristicia, that sleeth man, as seith Seint Paul.  
<span id="an_726"></span> For certes, swich sorwe werketh to the deeth
of the soule and of the body also;  
<span id="an_726A"></span> for therof comth that a man is anoyed of his
owene lif.  
<span id="an_727"></span> Wherfore swich sorwe shorteth ful ofte the lif
of man, er that his tyme be come by wey of kynde.  
<span id="an_728"></span> Agayns this horrible synne of Accidie, and the
branches of the same, ther is a vertu that is called fortitudo or
strengthe,  
<span id="an_728A"></span> that is an affeccioun thurgh which a man
despiseth anoyouse thinges.  
<span id="an_729"></span> This vertu is so myghty and so vigerous that
it dar withstonde myghtily and wisely kepen hymself fro perils that been
wikked,  
<span id="an_729A"></span> and wrastle agayn the assautes of the
devel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_730">730</span></span> For it
enhaunceth and enforceth the soule, right as Accidie abateth it and
maketh it fieble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_730A">730A</span></span> For this
fortitudo may endure by long suffraunce the travailles that been
covenable.  
<span id="an_731"></span> This vertu hath manye speces; and the firste
is cleped magnanimitee, that is to seyn, greet corage.  
<span id="an_731A"></span> For certes, ther bihoveth greet corage agains
Accidie,  
<span id="an_731B"></span> lest that it ne swolwe the soule by the synne
of sorwe, or destroye it by wanhope.  
<span id="an_732"></span> This vertu maketh folk to undertake harde
thynges and grevouse thynges, by hir owene wil, wisely and resonably.  
<span id="an_733"></span> And for as muchel as the devel fighteth agayns
a man moore by queyntise and by sleighte than by strengthe,  
<span id="an_733A"></span> therfore men shal withstonden hym by wit and
by resoun and by discrecioun.  
<span id="an_734"></span> Thanne arn ther the vertues of feith and hope
in God and in his seintes  
<span id="an_734A"></span> to acheve and acomplice the goode werkes in
the whiche he purposeth fermely to continue.  
<span id="an_735"></span> Thanne comth seuretee or sikernesse, and that
is  
<span id="an_735A"></span> whan a man ne douteth no travaille in tyme
comynge of the goode werkes that a man hath bigonne.  
<span id="an_736"></span> Thanne comth magnificence; that is to seyn,
whan a man dooth and parfourneth grete werkes of goodnesse; and that is
the ende  
<span id="an_736A"></span> why that men sholde do goode werkes, for in
the acomplissynge of grete goode werkes lith the grete gerdoun.  
<span id="an_737"></span> Thanne is ther constaunce, that is stablenesse
of corage, and this sholde been in herte by stedefast feith,  
<span id="an_737A"></span> and in mouth, and in berynge, and in chiere,
and in dede.  
<span id="an_738"></span> Eke ther been mo speciale remedies against
Accidie in diverse werkes, and  
<span id="an_738A"></span> in consideracioun of the peynes of helle and
of the joyes of hevene,  
<span id="an_738B"></span> and in the trust of the grace of the Holy
Goost, that wole yeve hym myght to parfourne his goode entente.  
<span id="an_739"></span> After Accidie wol I speke of Avarice and of
Coveitise, of which synne seith  
<span id="an_739A"></span> Seint Paul that "the roote of alle harmes is
Coveitise." Ad Thimotheum Sexto.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740">740</span></span> For soothly,
whan the herte of a man is confounded in itself and troubled, and that  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740A">740A</span></span> the soule
hath lost the confort of God, thanne seketh he an ydel solas of worldly
thynges.  
<span id="an_741"></span> Avarice, after the descripcioun of Seint
Augustyn, is a likerousnesse in herte to have erthely thynges.  
<span id="an_742"></span> Som oother folk seyn that Avarice is for to
purchacen manye erthely thynges and no thyng yeve to hem that han
nede.  
<span id="an_743"></span> And understoond that Avarice ne stant nat
oonly in lond ne catel,  
<span id="an_743A"></span> but somtyme in science and in glorie, and in
every manere of outrageous thyng is Avarice and Coveitise.  
<span id="an_744"></span> And the difference bitwixe Avarice and
Coveitise is this: Coveitise is for to coveite swiche thynges as thou
hast nat;  
<span id="an_744A"></span> and Avarice is for to withholde and kepe
swiche thynges as thou hast, withoute rightful nede.  
<span id="an_745"></span> Soothly, this Avarice is a synne that is ful
dampnable, for al hooly writ curseth it and speketh agayns that vice,  
<span id="an_745A"></span> for it dooth wrong to Jhesu Crist.  
<span id="an_746"></span> For it bireveth hym the love that men to hym
owen, and turneth it bakward agayns alle resoun,  
<span id="an_747"></span> and maketh that the avaricious man hath moore
hope in his catel than in Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_747A"></span> and dooth moore observance in kepynge of his
tresor than he dooth to the service of Jhesu Crist.  
<span id="an_748"></span> And therfore seith Seint Paul Ad Ephesios
quinto, that an avaricious man is the thraldom of ydolatrie.  
<span id="an_749"></span> What difference is bitwixe an ydolastre and an
avaricious man, but that an ydolastre, per aventure, ne hath but o
mawmet or two,  
<span id="an_749A"></span> and the avaricious man hath manye? For
certes, every floryn in his cofre is his mawmet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750">750</span></span> And certes,
the synne of mawmettrie is the firste thyng  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750A">750A</span></span> that God
deffended in the ten comaundementz, as bereth witnesse in Exodi capitulo
vicesimo:  
<span id="an_751"></span> "Thou shalt have no false goddes bifore me, ne
thou shalt make to thee no grave thyng."  
<span id="an_751A"></span> Thus is an avaricious man, that loveth his
tresor biforn God, an ydolastre,  
<span id="an_752"></span> thurgh this cursed synne of avarice. Of
Coveitise comen thise harde lordshipes,  
<span id="an_752A"></span> thurgh whiche men been distreyned by
taylages, custumes, and cariages, moore than hire duetee or resoun is.  
<span id="an_752B"></span> And eek taken they of hire bonde-men
amercimentz, whiche myghten moore resonably ben cleped extorcions than
amercimentz.  
<span id="an_753"></span> Of whiche amercimentz and raunsonynge of
boonde-men somme lordes stywardes seyn that it is rightful,  
<span id="an_753A"></span> for as muche as a cherl hath no temporeel
thyng that it ne is his lordes, as they seyn.  
<span id="an_754"></span> But certes, thise lord-shipes doon wrong  
<span id="an_754A"></span> that bireven hire bonde-folk thynges that
they nevere yave hem. Augustinus, De Civitate libro nono.  
<span id="an_755"></span> "Sooth is that the condicioun of thraldom and
the firste cause of thraldom is for synne. Genesis nono.  
<span id="an_756"></span> Thus may ye seen that the gilt disserveth
thraldom, but nat nature."  
<span id="an_757"></span> Wherfore thise lordes ne sholde nat muche
glorifien hem in hir lordshipes,  
<span id="an_757A"></span> sith that by natureel condicion they been nat
lordes over thralles, but that thraldom comth first by the desert of
synne.  
<span id="an_758"></span> And forther over, ther as the lawe seith that
temporeel goodes of boonde-folk been the goodes of hir lordshipes, ye,  
<span id="an_758A"></span> that is for to understonde, the goodes of the
emperour, to deffenden hem in hir right,  
<span id="an_758B"></span> but nat for to robben hem ne reven hem.  
<span id="an_759"></span> And therfore seith Seneca, "Thy prudence
sholde lyve benignely with thy thralles."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_760">760</span></span> Thilke that
thou clepest thy thralles been Goddes peple, for humble folk been
Cristes freendes; they been contubernyal with the Lord.  
<span id="an_761"></span> Thynk eek that of swich seed as cherles
spryngen, of swich seed spryngen lordes.  
<span id="an_761A"></span> As wel may the cherl be saved as the lord.  
<span id="an_762"></span> The same deeth that taketh the cherl, swich
deeth taketh the lord.  
<span id="an_762A"></span> Wherfore I rede, do right so with thy cherl,
as thou woldest that thy lord dide with thee,  
<span id="an_762B"></span> if thou were in his plit.  
<span id="an_763"></span> Every synful man is a cherl to synne. I rede
thee, certes, that thou, lord,  
<span id="an_763A"></span> werke in swich wise with thy cherles that
they rather love thee than drede.  
<span id="an_764"></span> I woot wel ther is degree above degree, as
reson is,  
<span id="an_764A"></span> and skile is that men do hir devoir ther as
it is due,  
<span id="an_764B"></span> but certes, extorcions and despit of youre
underlynges is dampnable.  
<span id="an_765"></span> And forther over, understoond wel that thise
conquerours or tirauntz maken ful ofte thralles  
<span id="an_765A"></span> of hem that been born of as roial blood as
been they that hem conqueren.  
<span id="an_766"></span> This name of thraldom was nevere erst kowth
til  
<span id="an_766A"></span> that Noe seyde that his sone Canaan sholde be
thral to his bretheren for his synne.  
<span id="an_767"></span> What seye we thanne of hem that pilen and doon
extorcions to hooly chirche?  
<span id="an_767A"></span> Certes, the swerd that men yeven first to a
knyght, whan he is newe dubbed, signifieth that he sholde deffenden
hooly chirche,  
<span id="an_767B"></span> and nat robben it ne pilen it; and whoso
dooth is traitour to Crist.  
<span id="an_768"></span> And, as seith Seint Augustyn, "They been the
develes wolves that stranglen the sheep of Jhesu Crist," and doon worse
than wolves.  
<span id="an_769"></span> For soothly, whan the wolf hath ful his wombe,
he stynteth to strangle sheep.  
<span id="an_769A"></span> But soothly, the pilours and destroyours of
the godes of hooly chirche ne do nat so, for they ne stynte nevere to
pile.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> Now as I have
seyd, sith so is that synne was first cause of thraldom, thanne is it
thus:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770A">770A</span></span> that thilke
tyme that al this world was in synne, thanne was al this world in
thraldom and subjeccioun.  
<span id="an_771"></span> But certes, sith the time of grace cam, God
ordeyned that som folk sholde be moore heigh in estaat and in degree,  
<span id="an_771A"></span> and som folk moore lough, and that everich
sholde be served in his estaat and in his degree.  
<span id="an_772"></span> And therfore in somme contrees, ther they byen
thralles, whan they han turned hem to the feith,  
<span id="an_772A"></span> they maken hire thralles free out of
thraldom. And therfore,  
<span id="an_772B"></span> certes, the lord oweth to his man that the
man oweth to his lord.  
<span id="an_773"></span> The Pope calleth hymself servant of the
servantz of God; but  
<span id="an_773A"></span> for as muche as the estaat of hooly chirche
ne myghte nat han be, ne the commune profit myghte nat han be kept,  
<span id="an_773B"></span> ne pees and rest in erthe, but if God hadde
ordeyned that som men hadde hyer degree and som men lower,  
<span id="an_774"></span> therfore was sovereyntee ordeyned, to kepe and
mayntene and deffenden hire underlynges or hire subgetz in resoun,  
<span id="an_774A"></span> as ferforth as it lith in hire power, and nat
to destroyen hem ne confounde.  
<span id="an_775"></span> Wherfore I seye that thilke lordes that been
lyk wolves,  
<span id="an_775A"></span> that devouren the possessiouns or the catel
of povre folk wrongfully, withouten mercy or mesure,  
<span id="an_776"></span> they shul receyven by the same mesure that
they han mesured to povre folk the  
<span id="an_776A"></span> mercy of Jhesu Crist, but if it be amended.  
<span id="an_777"></span> Now comth deceite bitwixe marchaunt and
marchant. And thow shalt understonde that marchandise is in manye
maneres;  
<span id="an_777A"></span> that oon is bodily, and that oother is
goostly; that oon is honest and leveful, and that oother is deshonest
and unleveful.  
<span id="an_778"></span> Of thilke bodily marchandise that is leveful
and honest is this:  
<span id="an_778A"></span> that, there as God hath ordeyned that a regne
or a contree is suffisaunt to hymself,  
<span id="an_778B"></span> thanne is it honest and leveful that of
habundaunce of this contree, that men helpe another contree that is
moore nedy.  
<span id="an_779"></span> And therfore ther moote been marchantz to
bryngen fro that o contree to that oother hire marchandises.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_780">780</span></span> That oother
marchandise, that men haunten with fraude and trecherie and deceite,
with lesynges and false othes, is cursed and dampnable.  
<span id="an_781"></span> Espiritueel marchandise is proprely symonye,
that is ententif desir to byen thyng espiritueel;  
<span id="an_781A"></span> that is, thyng that aperteneth to the
seintuarie of God and to cure of the soule.  
<span id="an_782"></span> This desir, if so be that a man do his
diligence to parfournen it,  
<span id="an_782A"></span> al be it that his desir ne take noon effect,
yet is it to hym a deedly synne;  
<span id="an_782B"></span> and if he be ordred, he is irreguleer.  
<span id="an_783"></span> Certes symonye is cleped of Simon Magus, that
wolde han boght for temporeel catel  
<span id="an_783A"></span> the yifte that God hadde yeven by the Hooly
Goost to Seint Peter and to the apostles.  
<span id="an_784"></span> And therfore understoond that bothe he that
selleth and he that beyeth thynges espirituels been cleped symonyals,  
<span id="an_784A"></span> be it by catel, be it by procurynge, or by
flesshly preyere of his freendes, flesshly freendes or espiritueel
freendes:  
<span id="an_785"></span> Flesshly in two maneres; as by kynrede, or
othere freendes. Soothly, if they praye for hym that is nat worthy and
able,  
<span id="an_785A"></span> it is symonye, if he take the benefice; and
if he be worthy and able, ther nys noon.  
<span id="an_786"></span> That oother manere is whan men or wommen
preyen for folk to avauncen hem,  
<span id="an_786A"></span> oonly for wikked flesshly affeccioun that
they han unto the persone, and that is foul symonye.  
<span id="an_787"></span> But certes, in service, for which men yeven
thynges espirituels unto hir servantz, it moot been understonde that  
<span id="an_787A"></span> the service moot been honest and elles nat;
and eek that it be withouten bargaynynge, and that the persone be
able.  
<span id="an_788"></span> For, as seith Seint Damasie, "Alle the synnes
of the world, at regard of this synne, arn as thyng of noght."  
<span id="an_788A"></span> For it is the gretteste synne that may be,
after the synne of Lucifer and Antecrist.  
<span id="an_789"></span> For by this synne God forleseth the chirche
and the soule that he boghte with his precious blood,  
<span id="an_789A"></span> by hem that yeven chirches to hem that been
nat digne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_790">790</span></span> For they
putten in theves that stelen the soules of Jhesu Crist and destroyen his
patrimoyne.  
<span id="an_791"></span> By swiche undigne preestes and curates han
lewed men the lasse reverence of the sacramentz of hooly chirche,  
<span id="an_791A"></span> and swiche yeveres of chirches putten out the
children of Crist and putten into the chirche the develes owene sone.  
<span id="an_792"></span> They sellen the soules that lambes sholde
kepen to the wolf that strangleth hem.  
<span id="an_792A"></span> And therfore shul they nevere han part of the
pasture of lambes, that is the blisse of hevene.  
<span id="an_793"></span> Now comth hasardrie with his apurtenaunces, as
tables and rafles, of which comth deceite, false othes, chidynges, and
alle ravynes,  
<span id="an_793A"></span> blasphemynge and reneiynge of God, and hate
of his neighebores, wast of goodes, mysspendynge of tyme, and somtyme
manslaughtre.  
<span id="an_794"></span> Certes, hasardours ne mowe nat been withouten
greet synne whiles they haunte that craft.  
<span id="an_795"></span> Of Avarice comen eek lesynges, thefte, fals
witnesse, and false othes.  
<span id="an_795A"></span> And ye shul understonde that thise been grete
synnes and expres agayn the comaundementz of God, as I have seyd.  
<span id="an_796"></span> Fals witnesse is in word and eek in dede. In
word, as for to bireve thy neighebores goode name by thy fals
witnessyng,  
<span id="an_796A"></span> or bireven hym his catel or his heritage by
thy fals witnessyng, whan thou for ire, or for meede,  
<span id="an_796B"></span> or for envye, berest fals witnesse, or
accusest hym or excusest hym by thy fals witnesse, or elles excusest
thyself falsly.  
<span id="an_797"></span> Ware yow, questemongeres and notaries! Certes,
for fals witnessyng was Susanna in ful gret sorwe and peyne, and many
another mo.  
<span id="an_798"></span> The synne of thefte is eek expres agayns
Goddes heeste, and that in two maneres, corporeel or spiritueel.  
<span id="an_799"></span> Corporeel, as for to take thy neighebores
catel agayn his wyl,  
<span id="an_799A"></span> be it by force or by sleighte, be it by met
or by mesure;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_800">800</span></span> by stelyng
eek of false enditementz upon hym, and in borwynge of thy neighebores
catel,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_800A">800A</span></span> in entente
nevere to payen it agayn, and semblable thynges.  
<span id="an_801"></span> Espiritueel thefte is sacrilege; that is to
seyn, hurtynge of hooly thynges, or of thynges sacred to Crist, in two
maneres:  
<span id="an_801A"></span> by reson of the hooly place, as chirches or
chirche-hawes,  
<span id="an_802"></span> for which every vileyns synne that men doon in
swiche places may be cleped sacrilege, or every violence in the
semblable places;  
<span id="an_802A"></span> also, they that withdrawen falsly the rightes
that longen to hooly chirche.  
<span id="an_803"></span> And pleynly and generally, sacrilege is to
reven hooly thyng fro hooly place,  
<span id="an_803A"></span> or unhooly thyng out of hooly place, or hooly
thing out of unhooly place.  
<span id="an_804"></span> Now shul ye understonde that the releevynge of
Avarice is misericorde, and pitee largely taken.  
<span id="an_804A"></span> And men myghten axe why that misericorde and
pitee is releevynge of Avarice.  
<span id="an_805"></span> Certes, the avricious man sheweth no pitee ne
misericorde to the nedeful man, for he deliteth hym  
<span id="an_805A"></span> in the kepynge of his tresor, and nat in the
rescowynge ne releevynge of his evene-Cristen. And therfore speke I
first of misericorde.  
<span id="an_806"></span> Thanne is misericorde, as seith the
Philosophre, a vertu  
<span id="an_806A"></span> by which the corage of a man is stired by the
mysese of hym that is mysesed.  
<span id="an_807"></span> Upon which misericorde folweth pitee in
parfournynge of charitable werkes of misericorde.  
<span id="an_808"></span> And certes, thise thynges moeven a man to the
misericorde of Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_808A"></span> that he yaf hymself for oure gilt, and
suffred deeth for misericorde, and forgaf us oure originale synnes,  
<span id="an_809"></span> and therby relessed us fro the peynes of
helle, and amenused the peynes of purgatorie by penitence,  
<span id="an_809A"></span> and yeveth grace wel to do, and atte laste
the blisse of hevene.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810">810</span></span> The speces of
misericorde been, as for to lene and for to yeve, and to foryeven and
relesse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810A">810A</span></span> and for to
han pitee in herte and compassioun of the meschief of his
evene-Cristene, and eek to chastise, there as nede is.  
<span id="an_811"></span> Another manere of remedie agayns avarice is
resonable largesse; but soothly, heere bihoveth the consideracioun of
the grace of Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_811A"></span> and of his temporeel goodes, and eek of the
goodes perdurables that Crist yaf to us;  
<span id="an_812"></span> and to han remembrance of the deeth that he
shal receyve, he noot whanne, where, ne how;  
<span id="an_812A"></span> and eek that he shal forgon al that he hath,
save oonly that he hath despended in goode werkes.  
<span id="an_813"></span> But for as muche as som folk been unmesurable,
men oghten eschue fool-largesse, that men clepen wast.  
<span id="an_814"></span> Certes, he that is fool-large ne yeveth nat
his catel, but he leseth his catel.  
<span id="an_814A"></span> Soothly, what thyng that he yeveth for veyne
glorie, as to mynstrals and to folk for to beren his renoun  
<span id="an_814B"></span> in the world, he hath synne therof and noon
almesse.  
<span id="an_815"></span> Certes, he leseth foule his good that ne
seketh with the yifte of his good nothyng but synne.  
<span id="an_816"></span> He is lyk to an hors that seketh  
<span id="an_816A"></span> rather to drynken drovy or trouble water than
for to drynken water of the clere welle.  
<span id="an_817"></span> And for as muchel as they yeven ther as they
sholde nat yeven, to hem aperteneth  
<span id="an_817A"></span> thilke malisoun that Crist shal yeven at the
day of doom to hem that shullen been dampned.  
<span id="an_818"></span> After Avarice comth Glotonye, which is expres
eek agayn the comandement of God. Glotonye is unmesurable appetit to ete
or to drynke,  
<span id="an_818A"></span> or elles to doon ynogh to the unmesurable
appetit and desordeynee coveitise to eten or to drynke.  
<span id="an_819"></span> This synne corrumped al this world, as is wel
shewed in the synne of Adam and of Eve.  
<span id="an_819A"></span> Looke eek what seith Seint Paul of
Glotonye:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820">820</span></span> "Manye,"
seith Saint Paul, "goon, of whiche I have ofte seyd to yow,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820A">820A</span></span> and now I
seye it wepynge, that been the enemys of the croys of Crist; of whiche
the ende is deeth,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820B">820B</span></span> and of
whiche hire wombe is hire god, and hire glorie in confusioun of hem that
so savouren erthely thynges."  
<span id="an_821"></span> He that is usaunt to this synne of glotonye,
he ne may no synne withstonde.  
<span id="an_821A"></span> He moot been in servage of alle vices, for it
is the develes hoord ther he hideth hym and resteth.  
<span id="an_822"></span> This synne hath manye speces. The firste is
dronkenesse, that is the horrible sepulture of mannes resoun;  
<span id="an_822A"></span> and therfore, whan a man is dronken, he hath
lost his resoun; and this is deedly synne.  
<span id="an_823"></span> But soothly, whan that a man is nat wont to
strong drynke, and peraventure ne knoweth nat the strengthe of the
drynke,  
<span id="an_823A"></span> or hath feblesse in his heed, or hath
travailed, thurgh which he drynketh the moore, al be he sodeynly caught
with drynke,  
<span id="an_823B"></span> it is no deedly synne, but venyal.  
<span id="an_824"></span> The seconde spece of glotonye is that the
spirit of a man wexeth al trouble,  
<span id="an_824A"></span> for dronkenesse bireveth hym the discrecioun
of his wit.  
<span id="an_825"></span> The thridde spece of glotonye is whan a man
devoureth his mete and hath no rightful manere of etynge.  
<span id="an_826"></span> The fourthe is whan, thurgh the grete
habundaunce of his mete, the humours in his body been distempred.  
<span id="an_827"></span> The fifthe is foryetelnesse by to muchel
drynkynge, for which somtyme  
<span id="an_827A"></span> a man foryeteth er the morwe what he dide at
even, or on the nyght biforn.  
<span id="an_828"></span> In oother manere been distinct the speces of
Glotonye, after Seint Gregorie. The firste is for to ete biforn tyme to
ete.  
<span id="an_828A"></span> The seconde is whan a man get hym to delicaat
mete or drynke.  
<span id="an_829"></span> The thridde is whan men taken to muche over
mesure. The fourthe is curiositee, with greet entente to maken and
apparaillen his mete.  
<span id="an_829A"></span> The fifthe is for to eten to gredily.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_830">830</span></span> Thise been
the fyve fyngres of the develes hand, by whiche he draweth folk to
synne.  
<span id="an_831"></span> Agayns Glotonye is the remedie abstinence, as
seith Galien; but that holde I nat meritorie,  
<span id="an_831A"></span> if he do it oonly for the heele of his body.
Seint Augustyn wole that abstinence be doon for vertu and with
pacience.  
<span id="an_832"></span> "Abstinence," he seith, "is litel worth but if
a man have good wil therto,  
<span id="an_832A"></span> and but it be enforced by pacience and by
charitee, and that men doon it for Godes sake,  
<span id="an_832B"></span> and in hope to have the blisse of hevene."  
<span id="an_833"></span> The felawes of abstinence been attemperaunce,
that holdeth the meene in alle thynges; eek shame, that eschueth alle
deshonestee;  
<span id="an_833A"></span> suffisance, that seketh no riche metes ne
drynkes, ne dooth no fors of to outrageous apparailynge of mete;  
<span id="an_834"></span> mesure also, that restreyneth by resoun the
deslavee appetit of etynge; sobrenesse also, that restreyneth the
outrage of drynke;  
<span id="an_835"></span> sparynge also, that restreyneth the delicaat
ese to sitte longe at his mete and softely,  
<span id="an_835A"></span> wherfore some folk stonden of hir owene wyl
to eten at the lasse leyser.  
<span id="an_836"></span> After Glotonye thanne comth Lecherie, for
thise two synnes been so ny cosyns that ofte tyme they wol nat
departe.  
<span id="an_837"></span> God woot, this synne is ful displesaunt thyng
to God, for he seyde hymself,  
<span id="an_837A"></span> "Do no lecherie." And therfore he putte grete
peynes agayns this synne in the olde lawe.  
<span id="an_838"></span> If womman thral were taken in this synne, she
sholde be beten with staves to the deeth;  
<span id="an_838A"></span> and if she were a gentil womman, she sholde
be slayn with  
<span id="an_838B"></span> stones; and if she were a bisshoppes doghter,
she sholde been brent, by Goddes comandement.  
<span id="an_839"></span> Forther over, by the synne of lecherie God
dreynte al the world at the diluge.  
<span id="an_839A"></span> And after that he brente fyve citees with
thonder-leyt, and sank hem into helle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_840">840</span></span> Now lat us
speke thanne of thilke stynkynge synne of Lecherie that men clepe
avowtrie of wedded folk;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_840A">840A</span></span> that is to
seyn, if that oon of hem be wedded, or elles bothe.  
<span id="an_841"></span> Seint John seith that avowtiers shullen been
in helle, in a stank brennynge of fyr and of brymston  
<span id="an_841A"></span> -- in fyr for hire lecherye, in brymston for
the stynk of hire ordure.  
<span id="an_842"></span> Certes, the brekynge of this sacrement is an
horrible thyng.  
<span id="an_842A"></span> It was maked of God hymself in paradys, and
confermed by Jhesu Crist, as witnesseth Seint Mathew in the gospel:  
<span id="an_842B"></span> "A man shal lete fader and mooder and taken
hym to his wif, and they shullen be two in o flessh."  
<span id="an_843"></span> This sacrement bitokneth the knyttynge togidre
of Crist and of hooly chirche.  
<span id="an_844"></span> And nat oonly that God forbad avowtrie in
dede, but eek he comanded that thou sholdest nat coveite thy neighebores
wyf.  
<span id="an_845"></span> "In this heeste," seith Seint Augustyn, "is
forboden alle manere coveitise to doon lecherie." Lo, what seith Seint
Mathew in the gospel, that  
<span id="an_845A"></span> "whoso seeth a womman to coveitise of his
lust, he hath doon lecherie with hire in his herte."  
<span id="an_846"></span> Heere may ye seen that nat oonly the dede of
this synne is forboden, but eek the desir to doon that synne.  
<span id="an_847"></span> This cursed synne anoyeth grevousliche hem
that it haunten. And first to hire soule,  
<span id="an_847A"></span> for he obligeth it to synne and to peyne of
deeth that is perdurable.  
<span id="an_848"></span> Unto the body anoyeth it grevously also, for
it dreyeth hym, and wasteth him, and shent hym, and of his blood  
<span id="an_848A"></span> he maketh sacrifice to the feend of helle. It
wasteth eek his catel and his substaunce.  
<span id="an_849"></span> And certes, if it be a foul thyng a man to
waste his catel on wommen,  
<span id="an_849A"></span> yet is it a fouler thyng whan that, for swich
ordure, wommen dispenden upon men hir catel and substaunce.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_850">850</span></span> This synne,
as seith the prophete, bireveth man and womman hir goode fame and al
hire honour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_850A">850A</span></span> and it is
ful plesaunt to the devel, for therby wynneth he the mooste partie of
this world.  
<span id="an_851"></span> And right as a marchant deliteth hym moost in
chaffare that he hath moost avantage of,  
<span id="an_851A"></span> right so deliteth the fend in this ordure.  
<span id="an_852"></span> This is that oother hand of the devel with
fyve fyngres to cacche the peple to his vileynye.  
<span id="an_853"></span> The firste fynger is the fool lookynge of the
fool womman and of the fool man; that sleeth, right  
<span id="an_853A"></span> as the basilicok sleeth folk by the venym of
his sighte, for the coveitise of eyen folweth the coveitise of the
herte.  
<span id="an_854"></span> The seconde fynger is the vileyns touchynge in
wikkede manere.  
<span id="an_854A"></span> And therfore seith Salomon that "whoso
toucheth and handleth a womman, he fareth lyk  
<span id="an_854B"></span> hym that handleth the scorpioun that styngeth
and sodeynly sleeth thurgh his envenymynge"; as whoso toucheth warm
pych, it shent his fyngres.  
<span id="an_855"></span> The thridde is foule wordes, that fareth lyk
fyr, that right anon brenneth the herte.  
<span id="an_856"></span> The fourthe fynger is the kissynge; and
trewely he were a greet fool  
<span id="an_856A"></span> that wolde kisse the mouth of a brennynge
oven or of a fourneys.  
<span id="an_857"></span> And moore fooles been they that kissen in
vileynye, for that mouth is the mouth of helle;  
<span id="an_857A"></span> and namely thise olde dotardes holours, yet
wol they kisse, though they may nat do, and smatre hem.  
<span id="an_858"></span> Certes, they been lyk to houndes; for an
hound, whan he comth by the roser or by othere \[bushes\],  
<span id="an_858A"></span> though he may nat pisse, yet wole he heve up
his leg and make a contenaunce to pisse.  
<span id="an_859"></span> And for that many man weneth that he may nat
synne for no likerousnesse that he dooth with his wyf,  
<span id="an_859A"></span> certes, that opinion is fals. God woot, a man
may sleen hymself with his owene knyf,  
<span id="an_859B"></span> and make hymselve dronken of his owene
tonne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_860">860</span></span> Certes, be it
wyf, be it child,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_860A">860A</span></span> or any
worldly thyng that he loveth biforn God, it is his mawmet, and he is an
ydolastre.  
<span id="an_861"></span> Man sholde loven hys wyf by discrecioun,
paciently and atemprely, and thanne is she as though it were his
suster.  
<span id="an_862"></span> The fifthe fynger of the develes hand is the
stynkynge dede of Leccherie.  
<span id="an_863"></span> Certes, the fyve fyngres of Glotonie the feend
put in the wombe of a man,  
<span id="an_863A"></span> and with his fyve fingres of Lecherie he
gripeth hym by the reynes for to throwen hym into the fourneys of
helle,  
<span id="an_864"></span> ther as they shul han the fyr and the wormes
that evere shul lasten, and wepynge and wailynge, sharp hunger and
thurst,  
<span id="an_864A"></span> \[and\] grymnesse of develes, that shullen al
totrede hem withouten respit and withouten ende.  
<span id="an_865"></span> Of Leccherie, as I seyde, sourden diverse
speces, as fornicacioun, that is bitwixe man and womman that been nat
maried,  
<span id="an_865A"></span> and this is deedly synne and agayns nature.  
<span id="an_866"></span> Al that is enemy and destruccioun to nature is
agayns nature.  
<span id="an_867"></span> Parfay, the resoun of a man telleth eek hym
wel that it is deedly synne, for as muche as God forbad leccherie.  
<span id="an_867A"></span> And Seint Paul yeveth hem the regne that nys
dewe to no wight but to hem that doon deedly synne.  
<span id="an_868"></span> Another synne of Leccherie is to bireve a
mayden of hir maydenhede, for he that so dooth,  
<span id="an_868A"></span> certes, he casteth a mayden out of the hyeste
degree that is in this present lif  
<span id="an_869"></span> and bireveth hire thilke precious fruyt that
the book clepeth the hundred fruyt.  
<span id="an_869A"></span> I ne kan seye it noon ootherweyes in
Englissh, but in Latyn it highte Centesimus fructus.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870">870</span></span> Certes, he
that so dooth is cause of manye damages and vileynyes, mo than any man
kan rekene;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870A">870A</span></span> right as he
somtyme is cause of alle damages that beestes don in the feeld, that
breketh the hegge or the closure,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870B">870B</span></span> thurgh
which he destroyeth that may nat been restoored.  
<span id="an_871"></span> For certes, namoore may maydenhede be
restoored than an arm that is smyten fro the body may retourne agayn to
wexe.  
<span id="an_872"></span> She may have mercy, this woot I wel, if she do
penitence; but nevere shal it be that she nas corrupt.  
<span id="an_873"></span> And al be it so that I have spoken somwhat of
avowtrie,  
<span id="an_873A"></span> it is good to shewen mo perils that longen to
avowtrie, for to eschue that foule synne.  
<span id="an_874"></span> Avowtrie in Latyn is for to seyn approchynge
of oother mannes bed,  
<span id="an_874A"></span> thurgh which tho that whilom weren o flessh
abawndone hir bodyes to othere persones.  
<span id="an_875"></span> Of this synne, as seith the wise man, folwen
manye harmes.  
<span id="an_875A"></span> First, brekynge of feith, and certes in feith
is the keye of Cristendom.  
<span id="an_876"></span> And whan that feith is broken and lorn,
soothly Cristendom stant veyn and withouten fruyt.  
<span id="an_877"></span> This synne is eek a thefte, for thefte
generally is for to reve a wight his thyng agayns his wille.  
<span id="an_878"></span> Certes, this is the fouleste thefte that may
be, whan a womman steleth hir body from hir housbonde  
<span id="an_878A"></span> and yeveth it to hire holour to defoulen
hire, and steleth hir soule fro Crist and yeveth it to the devel.  
<span id="an_879"></span> This is a fouler thefte than for to breke a
chirche and stele the chalice,  
<span id="an_879A"></span> for thise avowtiers breken the temple of God
spiritually, and stelen the vessel of grace, that is the body and the
soule,  
<span id="an_879B"></span> for which Crist shal destroyen hem, as seith
Seint Paul.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> Soothly, of
this thefte douted gretly Joseph, whan that his lordes wyf preyed hym of
vileynye, whan he seyde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880A">880A</span></span> "Lo, my
lady, how my lord hath take to me under my warde al that he hath in this
world,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880B">880B</span></span> ne no thyng
of his thynges is out of my power, but oonly ye, that been his wyf.  
<span id="an_881"></span> And how sholde I thanne do this wikkednesse,
and synne so horribly agayns God and agayns my lord?  
<span id="an_881A"></span> God it forbeede!" Allas, al to litel is swich
trouthe now yfounde.  
<span id="an_882"></span> The thridde harm is the filthe thurgh which
they breken the comandement of God, and defoulen the auctour of
matrimoyne, that is Crist.  
<span id="an_883"></span> For certes, in so muche as the sacrement of
mariage is so noble and so digne, so muche is it gretter synne  
<span id="an_883A"></span> for to breken it, for God made mariage in
paradys, in the estaat of innocence, to multiplye mankynde to the
service of God.  
<span id="an_884"></span> And therfore is the brekynge therof the moore
grevous; of which brekynge comen false heires ofte tyme, that wrongfully
ocupien folkes heritages.  
<span id="an_884A"></span> And therfore wol Crist putte hem out of the
regne of hevene, that is heritage to goode folk.  
<span id="an_885"></span> Of this brekynge comth eek ofte tyme that folk
unwar wedden or synnen with hire owene kynrede, and namely thilke
harlotes that haunten  
<span id="an_885A"></span> bordels of thise fool wommen, that mowe be
likned to a commune gong, where as men purgen hire ordure.  
<span id="an_886"></span> What seye we eek of putours that lyven by the
horrible synne of putrie, and constreyne wommen to yelden hem a certeyn
rente  
<span id="an_886A"></span> of hire bodily puterie, ye, somtyme of his
owene wyf or his child, as doon thise bawdes? Certes, thise been cursede
synnes.  
<span id="an_887"></span> Understoond eek that Avowtrie is set gladly in
the ten comandementz bitwixe thefte and manslaughtre;  
<span id="an_887A"></span> for it is the gretteste thefte that may be,
for it is thefte of body and of soule.  
<span id="an_888"></span> And it is lyk to homycide, for it kerveth atwo
and breketh atwo hem that first were maked o flessh.  
<span id="an_888A"></span> And therfore, by the olde lawe of God, they
sholde be slayn.  
<span id="an_889"></span> But nathelees, by the lawe of Jhesu Crist,
that is lawe of pitee, whan he seyde to the womman  
<span id="an_889A"></span> that was founden in avowtrie, and sholde han
been slayn with stones, after the wyl of the Jewes, as was hir lawe,  
<span id="an_889B"></span> "Go," quod Jhesu Crist, "and have namoore wyl
to synne," or, "wille namoore to do synne."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_890">890</span></span> Soothly the
vengeaunce of Avowtrie is awarded to the peynes of helle, but if so be
that it be destourbed by penitence.  
<span id="an_891"></span> Yet been ther mo speces of this cursed synne;
as whan that oon of hem is religious, or elles bothe;  
<span id="an_891A"></span> or of folk that been entred into ordre, as
subdekne, or dekne, or preest, or hospitaliers.  
<span id="an_891B"></span> And evere the hyer that he is in ordre, the
gretter is the synne.  
<span id="an_892"></span> The thynges that gretly agreggen hire synne is
the brekynge of hire avow of chastitee, whan they receyved the ordre.  
<span id="an_893"></span> And forther over, sooth is that hooly ordre is
chief of al the tresorie of God  
<span id="an_893A"></span> and his especial signe and mark of chastitee
to shewe that they been joyned to chastitee,  
<span id="an_893B"></span> which that is the moost precious lyf that
is.  
<span id="an_894"></span> And thise ordred folk been specially titled to
God, and of the special meignee of God,  
<span id="an_894A"></span> for which, whan they doon deedly synne, they
been the special traytours of God and of his peple;  
<span id="an_894B"></span> for they lyven of the peple, to preye for the
peple,  
<span id="an_894C"></span> and while they ben suche traitours, here
preyer avayleth nat to the peple.  
<span id="an_895"></span> Preestes been aungels, as by the dignitee of
hir mysterye;  
<span id="an_895A"></span> but for sothe, Seint Paul seith that Sathanas
transformeth hym in an aungel of light.  
<span id="an_896"></span> Soothly, the preest that haunteth deedly
synne, he may be likned to the aungel of derknesse transformed in the
aungel of light.  
<span id="an_896A"></span> He semeth aungel of light, but for sothe he
is aungel of derknesse.  
<span id="an_897"></span> Swiche preestes been the sones of Helie,  
<span id="an_897A"></span> as sheweth in the Book of Kynges, that they
weren the sones of Belial -- that is, the devel.  
<span id="an_898"></span> Belial is to seyn, "withouten juge." And so
faren they; hem thynketh they been free and han no juge,  
<span id="an_898A"></span> namoore than hath a free bole that taketh
which cow that hym liketh in the town.  
<span id="an_899"></span> So faren they by wommen. For right as a free
bole is ynough for al a toun,  
<span id="an_899A"></span> right so is a wikked preest corrupcioun
ynough for al a parisshe, or for al a contree.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900">900</span></span> Thise
preestes, as seith the book, ne konne nat the mysterie of preesthod to
the peple, ne God ne knowe they nat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900A">900A</span></span> They ne
helde hem nat apayd, as seith the book, of soden flessh that was to hem
offred,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900B">900B</span></span> but they
tooke by force the flessh that is rawe.  
<span id="an_901"></span> Certes, so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat
apayed of roosted flessh and sode flessh,  
<span id="an_901A"></span> with which the peple feden hem in greet
reverence, but they wole have raw flessh of folkes wyves and hir
doghtres.  
<span id="an_902"></span> And certes, thise wommen that consenten to
hire harlotrie doon greet wrong to Crist,  
<span id="an_902A"></span> and to hooly chirche, and alle halwes, and to
alle soules;  
<span id="an_902B"></span> for they bireven alle thise hym that sholde
worshipe Crist and hooly chirche and preye for Cristene soules.  
<span id="an_903"></span> And therfore han swiche preestes, and hire
lemmanes eek that consenten to hir leccherie,  
<span id="an_903A"></span> the malisoun of al the court Cristien, til
they come to amendement.  
<span id="an_904"></span> The thridde spece of avowtrie is somtyme
bitwixe a man and his wyf, and that is  
<span id="an_904A"></span> whan they take no reward in hire assemblynge
but oonly to hire flesshly delit, as seith Seint Jerome,  
<span id="an_905"></span> and ne rekken of nothyng but that they been
assembled;  
<span id="an_905A"></span> by cause that they been maried, al is good
ynough, as thynketh to hem.  
<span id="an_906"></span> But in swich folk hath the devel power, as
seyde the aungel Raphael to Thobie,  
<span id="an_906A"></span> for in hire assemblynge they putten Jhesu
Crist out of hire herte and yeven hemself to alle ordure.  
<span id="an_907"></span> The fourthe spece is the assemblee of hem that
been of hire kynrede, or of hem that been of oon affynytee,  
<span id="an_907A"></span> or elles with hem with whiche hir fadres or
hir kynrede han deled in the synne of lecherie.  
<span id="an_907B"></span> This synne maketh hem lyk to houndes, that
taken no kep to kynrede.  
<span id="an_908"></span> And certes, parentele is in two maneres,
outher goostly or flesshly; goostly, as for to deelen with his
godsibbes.  
<span id="an_909"></span> For right so as he that engendreth a child is
his flesshly fader, right so is his godfader his fader espiritueel.  
<span id="an_909A"></span> For which a womman may in no lasse synne
assemblen with hire godsib than with hire owene flesshly brother.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_910">910</span></span> The fifthe
spece is thilke abhomynable synne, of which that no man unnethe oghte
speke ne write;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_910A">910A</span></span> nathelees
it is openly reherced in holy writ.  
<span id="an_911"></span> This cursednesse doon men and wommen in
diverse entente and in diverse manere; but though that hooly writ speke
of horrible synne,  
<span id="an_911A"></span> certes hooly writ may nat been defouled,
namoore than the sonne that shyneth on the mixne.  
<span id="an_912"></span> Another synne aperteneth to leccherie, that
comth in slepynge, and this synne cometh ofte to hem that been
maydenes,  
<span id="an_912A"></span> and eek to hem that been corrupt; and this
synne men clepen polucioun, that comth in foure maneres.  
<span id="an_913"></span> Somtyme of langwissynge of body, for the
humours been to ranke and to habundaunt in the body of man;  
<span id="an_913A"></span> somtyme of infermetee, for the fieblesse of
the vertu retentif, as phisik maketh mencion; somtyme for surfeet of
mete and drynke;  
<span id="an_914"></span> and somtyme of vileyns thoghtes that been
enclosed in mannes mynde whan he gooth to slepe, which may nat been
withoute synne;  
<span id="an_914A"></span> for which men moste kepen hem wisely, or
elles may men synnen ful grevously.  
<span id="an_915"></span> Now comth the remedie agayns Leccherie, and
that is generally chastitee and continence,  
<span id="an_915A"></span> that restreyneth alle the desordeynee
moevynges that comen of flesshly talentes.  
<span id="an_916"></span> And evere the gretter merite shal he han that
moost restreyneth the wikkede eschawfynges of the \[ardour\] of this
synne.  
<span id="an_916A"></span> And this is in two maneres -- that is to
seyn, chastitee in mariage, and chastitee of widwehod.  
<span id="an_917"></span> Now shaltow understonde that matrimoyne is
leefful assemblynge of man and of womman that receyven by vertu of the
sacrement the boond  
<span id="an_917A"></span> thurgh which they may nat be departed in al
hir lyf -- that is to seyn, whil that they lyven bothe.  
<span id="an_918"></span> This, as seith the book, is a ful greet
sacrement.  
<span id="an_918A"></span> God maked it, as I have seyd, in paradys, and
wolde hymself be born in mariage.  
<span id="an_919"></span> And for to halwen mariage he was at a
weddynge, where as he turned water into wyn,  
<span id="an_919A"></span> which was the firste miracle that he wroghte
in erthe biforn his disciples.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_920">920</span></span> Trewe effect
of mariage clenseth fornicacioun and replenysseth hooly chirche of good
lynage, for that is the ende of mariage;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_920A">920A</span></span> and it
chaungeth deedly synne into venial synne bitwixe hem that been
ywedded,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_920B">920B</span></span> and maketh
the hertes al oon of hem that been ywedded, as wel as the bodies.  
<span id="an_921"></span> This is verray mariage, that was establissed
by God, er that synne bigan, whan natureel lawe was in his right poynt
in paradys;  
<span id="an_921A"></span> and it was ordeyned that o man sholde have
but o womman, and o womman but o man,  
<span id="an_921B"></span> as seith Seint Augustyn, by manye resouns.  
<span id="an_922"></span> First, for mariage is figured bitwixe Crist
and holy chirche. And that oother is for a man is heved of a womman;  
<span id="an_922A"></span> algate, by ordinaunce it sholde be so.  
<span id="an_923"></span> For if a womman hadde mo men than oon, thanne
sholde she have moo hevedes than oon, and  
<span id="an_923A"></span> that were an horrible thyng biforn God; and
eek a womman ne myghte nat plese to many folk at oones.  
<span id="an_923B"></span> And also ther ne sholde nevere be pees ne
reste amonges hem, for everich wolde axen his owene thyng.  
<span id="an_924"></span> And forther over, no man ne sholde knowe his
owene engendrure, ne who sholde have his heritage;  
<span id="an_924A"></span> and the womman sholde been the lasse biloved
fro the tyme that she were conjoynt to many men.  
<span id="an_925"></span> Now comth how that a man sholde bere hym with
his wif, and namely in two thynges;  
<span id="an_925A"></span> that is to seyn, in suffraunce and reverence,
as shewed Crist whan he made first womman.  
<span id="an_926"></span> For he ne made hire nat of the heved of Adam,
for she sholde nat clayme to greet lordshipe.  
<span id="an_927"></span> For ther as the womman hath the maistrie, she
maketh to muche desray.  
<span id="an_927A"></span> Ther neden none ensamples of this; the
experience of day by day oghte suffise.  
<span id="an_928"></span> Also, certes, God ne made nat womman of the
foot of Adam, for she ne sholde nat been holden to lowe;  
<span id="an_928A"></span> for she kan nat paciently suffre. But God
made womman of the ryb of Adam, for womman sholde be felawe unto man.  
<span id="an_929"></span> Man sholde bere hym to his wyf in feith, in
trouthe, and in love,  
<span id="an_929A"></span> as seith Seint Paul, that a man sholde loven
his wyf as Crist loved hooly chirche,  
<span id="an_929B"></span> that loved it so wel that he deyde for it. So
sholde a man for his wyf, if it were nede.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_930">930</span></span> Now how that
a womman sholde be subget to hire housbonde, that telleth Seint Peter.
First, in obedience.  
<span id="an_931"></span> And eek, as seith the decree, a womman that is
wyf, as longe as she is a wyf,  
<span id="an_931A"></span> she hath noon auctoritee to swere ne to bere
witnesse withoute leve of hir housbonde,  
<span id="an_931B"></span> that is hire lord; algate, he sholde be so by
resoun.  
<span id="an_932"></span> She sholde eek serven hym in alle honestee,
and been attempree of hire array.  
<span id="an_932A"></span> I woot wel that they sholde setten hire
entente to plesen hir housbondes, but nat by hire queyntise of array.  
<span id="an_933"></span> Seint Jerome seith that "wyves that been
apparailled in silk and in precious purpre ne mowe nat clothen hem in
Jhesu Crist."  
<span id="an_933A"></span> Loke what seith Seint John eek in thys
matere?  
<span id="an_934"></span> Seint Gregorie eek seith that "No wight seketh
precious array but oonly for veyne glorie, to been honoured the moore
biforn the peple."  
<span id="an_935"></span> It is a greet folye, a womman to have a fair
array outward and in hirself be foul inward.  
<span id="an_936"></span> A wyf sholde eek be mesurable in lookynge and
in berynge and in lawghynge, and discreet in alle hire wordes and hire
dedes.  
<span id="an_937"></span> And aboven alle worldly thyng she sholde loven
hire housbonde with al hire herte, and to hym be trewe of hir body.  
<span id="an_938"></span> So sholde an housbonde eek be to his wyf. For
sith that al the body is the housbondes,  
<span id="an_938A"></span> so sholde hire herte been, or elles ther is
bitwixe hem two, as in that, no parfit mariage.  
<span id="an_939"></span> Thanne shal men understonde that for thre
thynges a man and his wyf flesshly mowen assemble.  
<span id="an_939A"></span> The firste is in entente of engendrure of
children to the service of God, for certes that is the cause final of
matrimoyne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940">940</span></span> Another cause
is to yelden everich of hem to oother the dette of hire bodies,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940A">940A</span></span> for neither
of hem hath power of his owene body. The thridde is for to eschewe
leccherye and vileynye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940B">940B</span></span> The ferthe
is for sothe deedly synne.  
<span id="an_941"></span> As to the firste, it is meritorie; the seconde
also, for, as seith the decree, that  
<span id="an_941A"></span> she hath merite of chastitee that yeldeth to
hire housbonde the dette of hir body,  
<span id="an_941B"></span> ye, though it be agayn hir likynge and the
lust of hire herte.  
<span id="an_942"></span> The thridde manere is venyal synne; and,
trewely, scarsly may ther any of thise be withoute venial synne,  
<span id="an_942A"></span> for the corrupcion and for the delit.  
<span id="an_943"></span> The fourthe manere is for to understonde, as
if they assemble oonly for amorous love and for noon of the foreseyde
causes,  
<span id="an_943A"></span> but for to accomplice thilke brennynge delit,
they rekke nevere how ofte.  
<span id="an_943B"></span> Soothly it is deedly synne; and yet, with
sorwe, somme folk wol peynen hem moore to doon than to hire appetit
suffiseth.  
<span id="an_944"></span> The seconde manere of chastitee is for to been
a clene wydewe,  
<span id="an_944A"></span> and eschue the embracynges of man, and
desiren the embracynge of Jhesu Crist.  
<span id="an_945"></span> Thise been tho that han been wyves and han
forgoon hire housbondes,  
<span id="an_945A"></span> and eek wommen that han doon leccherie and
been releeved by penitence.  
<span id="an_946"></span> And certes, if that a wyf koude kepen hire al
chaast by licence of hir housbonde,  
<span id="an_946A"></span> so that she yeve nevere noon occasion that he
agilte, it were to hire a greet merite.  
<span id="an_947"></span> Thise manere wommen that observen chastitee
moste be clene in herte as wel as in body and in thought,  
<span id="an_947A"></span> and mesurable in clothynge and in
contenaunce, and been abstinent in etynge and drynkynge, in spekynge,
and in dede.  
<span id="an_947B"></span> They been the vessel or the boyste of the
blissed Magdelene, that fulfilleth hooly chirche of good odour.  
<span id="an_948"></span> The thridde manere of chastitee is virginitee,
and it bihoveth that she be hooly in herte and clene of body.  
<span id="an_948A"></span> Thanne is she spouse to Jhesu Crist, and she
is the lyf of angeles.  
<span id="an_949"></span> She is the preisynge of this world, and she is
as thise martirs in egalitee;  
<span id="an_949A"></span> she hath in hire that tonge may nat telle ne
herte thynke.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_950">950</span></span> Virginitee
baar oure Lord Jhesu Crist, and virgine was hymselve.  
<span id="an_951"></span> Another remedie agayns Leccherie is specially
to withdrawen swiche thynges as yeve occasion to thilke vileynye, as
ese, etynge, and drynkynge.  
<span id="an_951A"></span> For certes, whan the pot boyleth strongly,
the beste remedie is to withdrawe the fyr.  
<span id="an_952"></span> Slepynge longe in greet quiete is eek a greet
norice to Leccherie.  
<span id="an_953"></span> Another remedie agayns Leccherie is that a man
or a womman eschue the compaignye of hem  
<span id="an_953A"></span> by whiche he douteth to be tempted, for al be
it so that the dede be withstonden, yet is ther greet temptacioun.  
<span id="an_954"></span> Soothly, a whit wal, although it ne brenne
noght fully by stikynge of a candele, yet is the wal blak of the leyt.  
<span id="an_955"></span> Ful ofte tyme I rede that no man truste in his
owene perfeccioun,  
<span id="an_955A"></span> but he be stronger than Sampson, and hoolier
than David, and wiser than Salomon.  
<span id="an_956"></span> Now after that I have declared yow, as I kan,
the sevene deedly synnes,  
<span id="an_956A"></span> and somme of hire braunches and hire
remedies, soothly, if I koude, I wolde telle yow the ten comandementz.  
<span id="an_957"></span> But so heigh a doctrine I lete to divines.
Nathelees, I hope to God,  
<span id="an_957A"></span> they been touched in this tretice, everich of
hem alle.  
<span id="an_958"></span> Now for as muche as the seconde partie of
Penitence stant in confessioun of mouth,  
<span id="an_958A"></span> as I bigan in the firste chapitre, I seye,
Seint Augustyn seith,  
<span id="an_959"></span> "Synne is every word and every dede, and al
that men coveiten, agayn the lawe of Jhesu Crist;  
<span id="an_959A"></span> and this is for to synne in herte, in mouth,
and in dede, by thy fyve wittes,  
<span id="an_959B"></span> that been sighte, herynge, smellynge,
tastynge or savourynge, and feelynge."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_960">960</span></span> Now is it
good to understonde the circumstances that agreggen muchel every
synne.  
<span id="an_961"></span> Thou shalt considere what thow art that doost
the synne,  
<span id="an_961A"></span> wheither thou be male or femele, yong or
oold, gentil or thral,  
<span id="an_961B"></span> free or servant, hool or syk, wedded or
sengle, ordred or unordred, wys or fool, clerk or seculeer;  
<span id="an_962"></span> if she be of thy kynrede, bodily or goostly,
or noon;  
<span id="an_962A"></span> if any of thy kynrede have synned with hire,
or noon; and manye mo thinges.  
<span id="an_963"></span> Another circumstaunce is this: wheither it be
doon in fornicacioun or in avowtrie or noon, incest or noon, mayden or
noon,  
<span id="an_963A"></span> in manere of homicide or noon, horrible grete
synnes or smale, and how longe thou hast continued in synne.  
<span id="an_964"></span> The thridde circumstaunce is the place ther
thou hast do synne, wheither in oother mennes hous or in thyn owene,  
<span id="an_964A"></span> in feeld or in chirche or in chirchehawe, in
chirche dedicaat or noon.  
<span id="an_965"></span> For if the chirche be halwed, and man or
womman  
<span id="an_965A"></span> spille his kynde inwith that place by wey of
synne or by wikked temptacioun,  
<span id="an_965B"></span> the chirche is entredited til it be
reconsiled by the bysshop.  
<span id="an_966"></span> And the preest sholde be enterdited that dide
swich a vileynye; to terme of al his lif he sholde namoore synge
masse,  
<span id="an_966A"></span> and if he dide, he sholde doon deedly synne
at every time that he so songe masse.  
<span id="an_967"></span> The fourthe circumstaunce is by whiche
mediatours, or by whiche messagers, as for enticement, or for
consentement to bere compaignye with felaweshipe;  
<span id="an_967A"></span> for many a wrecche, for to bere compaignye,
wol go to the devel of helle.  
<span id="an_968"></span> Wherfore they that eggen or consenten to the
synne been parteners of the synne, and of the dampnacioun of the
synnere.  
<span id="an_969"></span> The fifthe circumstaunce is how manye tymes
that he hath synned,  
<span id="an_969A"></span> if it be in his mynde, and how ofte that he
hath falle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970">970</span></span> For he that
ofte falleth in synne, he despiseth the mercy of God, and encreesseth
hys synne, and is unkynde to Crist;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970A">970A</span></span> and he
wexeth the moore fieble to withstonde synne, and synneth the moore
lightly,  
<span id="an_971"></span> and the latter ariseth, and is the moore
eschew for to shryven hym, and namely, to hym that is his confessour.  
<span id="an_972"></span> For which that folk, whan they falle agayn in
hir olde folies, outher they forleten hir olde confessours al outrely  
<span id="an_972A"></span> or elles they departen hir shrift in diverse
places; but soothly, swich departed shrift deserveth no mercy of God of
his synnes.  
<span id="an_973"></span> The sixte circumstaunce is why that a man
synneth, as by which temptacioun, and if hymself procure thilke
temptacioun,  
<span id="an_973A"></span> or by the excitynge of oother folk; or if he
synne with a womman by force, or by hire owene assent;  
<span id="an_974"></span> or if the womman, maugree hir hed, hath been
afforced, or noon. This shal she telle:  
<span id="an_974A"></span> for coveitise, or for poverte, and if it was
hire procurynge, or noon; and swich manere harneys.  
<span id="an_975"></span> The seventhe circumstaunce is in what manere
he hath doon his synne,  
<span id="an_975A"></span> or how that she hath suffred that folk han
doon to hire.  
<span id="an_976"></span> And the same shal the man telle pleynly with
alle circumstaunces; and wheither he hath synned with comune bordel
wommen or noon,  
<span id="an_977"></span> or doon his synne in hooly tymes or noon, in
fastyng tymes or noon, or biforn his shrifte, or after his latter
shrifte,  
<span id="an_978"></span> and hath peraventure broken therfore his
penance enjoyned, by whos help and whos conseil, by sorcerie or craft;
al moste be toold.  
<span id="an_979"></span> Alle thise thynges, after that they been grete
or smale, engreggen the conscience of man.  
<span id="an_979A"></span> And eek the preest, that is thy juge, may the
bettre been avysed of his juggement  
<span id="an_979B"></span> in yevynge of thy penaunce, and that is after
thy contricioun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980">980</span></span> For
understond wel that after tyme that a man hath defouled his baptesme by
synne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980A">980A</span></span> if he wole
come to salvacioun, ther is noon other wey but by penitence and shrifte
and satisfaccioun,  
<span id="an_981"></span> and namely by the two, if ther be a confessour
to which he may shriven hym,  
<span id="an_981A"></span> and the thridde, if he have lyf to parfournen
it.  
<span id="an_982"></span> Thanne shal man looke and considere that if he
wole maken a trewe and a profitable confessioun, ther moste be foure
condiciouns.  
<span id="an_983"></span> First, it moot been in sorweful bitternesse of
herte, as seyde the kyng Ezechias to God,  
<span id="an_983A"></span> "I wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lif
in bitternesse of myn herte."  
<span id="an_984"></span> This condicioun of bitternesse hath fyve
signes. The firste is that confessioun moste be shamefast, nat for to
covere ne hyden his synne,  
<span id="an_984A"></span> for he hath agilt his God and defouled his
soule.  
<span id="an_985"></span> And herof seith Seint Augustyn, "The herte
travailleth for shame of his synne";  
<span id="an_985A"></span> and for he hath greet shamefastnesse, he is
digne to have greet mercy of God.  
<span id="an_986"></span> Swich was the confessioun of the publican that
wolde nat heven up his eyen to hevene,  
<span id="an_986A"></span> for he hadde offended God of hevene; for
which shamefastnesse he hadde anon the mercy of God.  
<span id="an_987"></span> And therof seith Seint Augustyn that swich
shamefast folk been next foryevenesse and remissioun.  
<span id="an_988"></span> Another signe is humylitee in confessioun, of
which seith Seint Peter,  
<span id="an_988A"></span> "Humbleth yow under the myght of God." The
hond of God is myghty in confessioun, for  
<span id="an_988B"></span> therby God foryeveth thee thy synnes, for he
allone hath the power.  
<span id="an_989"></span> And this humylitee shal been in herte and in
signe outward, for right as he hath humylitee to God in his herte,  
<span id="an_989A"></span> right so sholde he humble his body outward to
the preest, that sit in Goddes place.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_990">990</span></span> For which in
no manere, sith that Crist is sovereyn, and the preest meene and
mediatour bitwixe Crist and the synnere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_990A">990A</span></span> and the
synnere is the laste by wey of resoun,  
<span id="an_991"></span> thanne sholde nat the synnere sitte as heighe
as his confessour, but knele biforn hym or at his feet,  
<span id="an_991A"></span> but if maladie destourbe it. For he shal nat
taken kep who sit there, but in whos place that he sitteth.  
<span id="an_992"></span> A man that hath trespased to a lord, and comth
for to axe mercy and maken his accord,  
<span id="an_992A"></span> and set him doun anon by the lord,  
<span id="an_992B"></span> men wolde holden hym outrageous, and nat
worthy so soone for to have remissioun ne mercy.  
<span id="an_993"></span> The thridde signe is how that thy shrift
sholde be ful of teeris, if man may,  
<span id="an_993A"></span> and if man may nat wepe with his bodily eyen,
lat hym wepe in herte.  
<span id="an_994"></span> Swich was the confession of Seint Peter, for
after that he hadde forsake Jhesu Crist, he wente out and weep ful
bitterly.  
<span id="an_995"></span> The fourthe signe is that he ne lette nat for
shame to shewen his confessioun.  
<span id="an_996"></span> Swich was the confessioun of the Magdalene,
that ne spared for no shame of hem  
<span id="an_996A"></span> that weren atte feeste, for to go to oure
Lord Jhesu Crist and biknowe to hym hire synne.  
<span id="an_997"></span> The fifthe signe is that a man or a womman be
obeisant to receyven the penaunce that hym is enjoyned for his synnes,  
<span id="an_997A"></span> for certes, Jhesu Crist, for the giltes of o
man, was obedient to the deeth.  
<span id="an_998"></span> The seconde condicion of verray confession is
that it be hastily doon.  
<span id="an_998A"></span> For certes, if a man hadde a deedly wounde,
evere the lenger that he taried to warisshe hymself,  
<span id="an_998B"></span> the moore wolde it corrupte and haste hym to
his deeth, and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to heele.  
<span id="an_999"></span> And right so fareth synne that longe tyme is
in a man unshewed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000">1000</span></span> Certes, a
man oghte hastily shewen his synnes for manye causes; as for drede of
deeth, that cometh ofte sodeynly,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000A">1000A</span></span> and no
certeyn what tyme it shal be, ne in what place; and eek the drecchynge
of o synne draweth in another;  
<span id="an_1001"></span> and eek the lenger that he tarieth, the
ferther he is fro Crist. And if he abide to his laste day, scarsly  
<span id="an_1001A"></span> may he shryven hym or remembre hym of his
synnes or repenten hym, for the grevous maladie of his deeth.  
<span id="an_1002"></span> And for as muche as he ne hath nat in his lyf
herkned Jhesu Crist  
<span id="an_1002A"></span> whanne he hath spoken, he shal crie to Jhesu
Crist at his laste day, and scarsly wol he herkne hym.  
<span id="an_1003"></span> And understond that this condicioun moste han
foure thynges. Thi shrift moste be purveyed bifore and avysed;  
<span id="an_1003A"></span> for wikked haste dooth no profit; and that a
man konne shryve hym of his synnes,  
<span id="an_1003B"></span> be it of pride, or of envye, and so forth
with the speces and circumstances;  
<span id="an_1004"></span> and that he have comprehended in hys mynde
the nombre and the greetnesse of his synnes,  
<span id="an_1004A"></span> and how longe that he hath leyn in synne;  
<span id="an_1005"></span> and eek that he be contrit of his synnes, and
in stidefast purpos,  
<span id="an_1005A"></span> by the grace of God, nevere eft to falle in
synne;  
<span id="an_1005B"></span> and eek that he drede and countrewaite
hymself, that he fle the occasiouns of synne to whiche he is enclyned.  
<span id="an_1006"></span> Also thou shalt shryve thee of alle thy
synnes to o man, and nat a parcel to o man and a parcel to another;  
<span id="an_1006A"></span> that is to understonde, in entente to
departe thy confessioun, as for shame or drede, for it nys but
stranglynge of thy soule.  
<span id="an_1007"></span> For certes Jhesu Crist is entierly al good;
in hym nys noon imperfeccioun,  
<span id="an_1007A"></span> and therfore outher he foryeveth al parfitly
or elles never a deel.  
<span id="an_1008"></span> I seye nat that if thow be assigned to the
penitauncer for certein synne,  
<span id="an_1008A"></span> that thow art bounde to shewen hym al the
remenaunt of thy synnes, of whiche thow hast be shryven of thy curaat,  
<span id="an_1008B"></span> but if it like to thee of thyn humylitee;
this is no departynge of shrifte.  
<span id="an_1009"></span> Ne I seye nat, ther as I speke of divisioun
of confessioun, that if thou have licence  
<span id="an_1009A"></span> for to shryve thee to a discreet and an
honest preest, where thee liketh, and by licence of thy curaat,  
<span id="an_1009B"></span> that thow ne mayst wel shryve thee to him of
alle thy synnes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1010">1010</span></span> But lat no
blotte be bihynde; lat no synne been untoold, as fer as thow hast
remembraunce.  
<span id="an_1011"></span> And whan thou shalt be shryven to thy curaat,
telle hym eek alle the synnes that thow hast doon  
<span id="an_1011A"></span> syn thou were last yshryven; this is no
wikked entente of divisioun of shrifte.  
<span id="an_1012"></span> Also the verray shrifte axeth certeine
condiciouns. First, that thow shryve thee by thy free wil,  
<span id="an_1012A"></span> noght constreyned, ne for shame of folk, ne
for maladie, ne swiche thynges.  
<span id="an_1012B"></span> For it is resoun that he that trespaseth by
his free wyl, that by his free wyl he confesse his trespas,  
<span id="an_1013"></span> and that noon oother man telle his synne but
he hymself;  
<span id="an_1013A"></span> ne he shal nat nayte ne denye his synne, ne
wratthe hym agayn the preest for his amonestynge to lete synne.  
<span id="an_1014"></span> The seconde condicioun is that thy shrift be
laweful; that is to seyn, that  
<span id="an_1014A"></span> thow that shryvest thee and eek the preest
that hereth thy confessioun been verraily in the feith of hooly
chirche,  
<span id="an_1015"></span> and that a man ne be nat despeired of the
mercy of Jhesu Crist, as Caym or Judas.  
<span id="an_1016"></span> And eek a man moot accusen hymself of his
owene trespas, and nat another;  
<span id="an_1016A"></span> but he shal blame and wyten hymself and his
owene malice of his synne, and noon oother.  
<span id="an_1017"></span> But nathelees, if that another man be
occasioun or enticere of his synne,  
<span id="an_1017A"></span> or the estaat of a persone be swich thurgh
which his synne is agregged, or elles that he may nat pleynly shryven  
<span id="an_1017B"></span> hym but he telle the persone with which he
hath synned, thanne may he telle it,  
<span id="an_1018"></span> so that his entente ne be nat to bakbite the
persone, but oonly to declaren his confessioun.  
<span id="an_1019"></span> Thou ne shalt nat eek make no lesynges in thy
confessioun, for humylitee,  
<span id="an_1019A"></span> peraventure, to seyn that thou hast doon
synnes of whiche thow were nevere gilty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1020">1020</span></span> For Seint
Augustyn seith, "If thou, by cause of thyn humylitee, makest lesynges on
thyself,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1020A">1020A</span></span> though
thow ne were nat in synne biforn, yet artow thanne in synne thurgh thy
lesynges."  
<span id="an_1021"></span> Thou most eek shewe thy synne by thyn owene
propre mouth, but thow be woxe dowmb, and nat by no lettre;  
<span id="an_1021A"></span> for thow that hast doon the synne, thou
shalt have the shame therfore.  
<span id="an_1022"></span> Thow shalt nat eek peynte thy confessioun by
faire subtile wordes, to covere the moore thy synne;  
<span id="an_1022A"></span> for thanne bigilestow thyself, and nat the
preest. Thow most tellen it platly, be it nevere so foul ne so
horrible.  
<span id="an_1023"></span> Thow shalt eek shryve thee to a preest that
is discreet to conseille  
<span id="an_1023A"></span> thee; and eek thou shalt nat shryve thee for
veyne glorie, ne for ypocrisye, ne for no cause  
<span id="an_1023B"></span> but oonly for the doute of Jhesu Crist and
the heele of thy soule.  
<span id="an_1024"></span> Thow shalt nat eek renne to the preest
sodeynly to tellen hym lightly thy synne,  
<span id="an_1024A"></span> as whoso telleth a jape or a tale, but
avysely and with greet devocioun.  
<span id="an_1025"></span> And generally, shryve thee ofte. If thou ofte
falle, ofte thou arise by confessioun.  
<span id="an_1026"></span> And though thou shryve thee ofter than ones
of synne of which thou hast be shryven, it is the moore merite.  
<span id="an_1026A"></span> And, as seith Seint Augustyn, thow shalt
have the moore lightly relessyng and grace of God, bothe of synne and of
peyne.  
<span id="an_1027"></span> And certes, oones a yeere atte leeste wey it
is laweful for to been housled, for certes, oones a yeere alle thynges
renovellen.  
<span id="an_1028"></span> Now have I toold yow of verray Confessioun,
that is the seconde partie of Penitence.  
<span id="an_1029"></span> The thridde partie of Penitence is
Satisfaccioun, and that stant moost generally in almesse and in bodily
peyne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1030">1030</span></span> Now been
ther thre manere of almesse: contricion of herte, where a man offreth
hymself to God;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1030A">1030A</span></span> another
is to han pitee of defaute of his neighebores; and the thridde is  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1030B">1030B</span></span> in
yevynge of good conseil and comfort, goostly and bodily, where men han
nede, and namely in sustenaunce of mannes foode.  
<span id="an_1031"></span> And tak kep that a man hath nede of thise
thinges generally: he hath nede of foode, he hath nede of clothyng and
herberwe,  
<span id="an_1031A"></span> he hath nede of charitable conseil and
visitynge in prisone and in maladie, and sepulture of his dede body.  
<span id="an_1032"></span> And if thow mayst nat visite the nedeful with
thy persone, visite hym by thy message and by thy yiftes.  
<span id="an_1033"></span> Thise been general almesses or werkes of
charitee  
<span id="an_1033A"></span> of hem that han temporeel richesses or
discrecioun in conseilynge. Of thise werkes shaltow heren at the day of
doom.  
<span id="an_1034"></span> Thise almesses shaltow doon of thyne owene
propre thynges, and hastily and prively, if thow mayst.  
<span id="an_1035"></span> But nathelees, if thow mayst nat doon it
prively, thow shalt nat forbere to doon almesse though men seen it,  
<span id="an_1035A"></span> so that it be nat doon for thank of the
world, but oonly for thank of Jhesu Crist.  
<span id="an_1036"></span> For, as witnesseth Seint Mathew, capitulo
quinto, "A citee may nat been hyd that is set on a montayne,  
<span id="an_1036A"></span> ne men lighte nat a lanterne and put it
under a busshel,  
<span id="an_1036B"></span> but men sette it on a candle-stikke to yeve
light to the men in the hous.  
<span id="an_1037"></span> Right so shal youre light lighten bifore men,
that they may seen youre goode werkes, and glorifie youre fader that is
in hevene."  
<span id="an_1038"></span> Now as to speken of bodily peyne, it stant in
preyeres, in wakynges, in fastynges, in vertuouse techynges of
orisouns.  
<span id="an_1039"></span> And ye shul understonde that orisouns or
preyeres is for to seyn a pitous wyl of herte,  
<span id="an_1039A"></span> that redresseth it in God and expresseth it
by word outward, to remoeven harmes and to han thynges espiritueel and
durable,  
<span id="an_1039B"></span> and somtyme temporele thynges; of whiche
orisouns, certes, in the orison of the Pater noster hath Jhesu Crist
enclosed moost thynges.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1040">1040</span></span> Certes, it
is privyleged of thre thynges in his dignytee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1040A">1040A</span></span> for which
it is moore digne than any oother preyere, for that Jhesu Crist hymself
maked it;  
<span id="an_1041"></span> and it is short, for it sholde be koud the
moore lightly, and  
<span id="an_1041A"></span> for to withholden it the moore esily in
herte, and helpen hymself the ofter with the orisoun,  
<span id="an_1042"></span> and for a man sholde be the lasse wery to
seyen it, and for a man may nat excusen hym to lerne it,  
<span id="an_1042A"></span> it is so short and so esy, and for it
comprehendeth in it self alle goode preyeres.  
<span id="an_1043"></span> The exposicioun of this hooly preyere, that
is so excellent and digne, I bitake to thise maistres of theologie,  
<span id="an_1043A"></span> save thus muchel wol I seyn; that whan thow
prayest that God sholde foryeve thee thy giltes as  
<span id="an_1043B"></span> thou foryevest hem that agilten to thee, be
ful wel war that thow ne be nat out of charitee.  
<span id="an_1044"></span> This hooly orison amenuseth eek venyal synne,
and therfore it aperteneth specially to penitence.  
<span id="an_1045"></span> This preyere moste be trewely seyd, and in
verray feith, and that men preye to God ordinatly and discreetly and
devoutly;  
<span id="an_1045A"></span> and alwey a man shal putten his wyl to be
subget to the wille of God.  
<span id="an_1046"></span> This orisoun moste eek been seyd with greet
humblesse and ful pure, honestly and nat to the anoyaunce of any man or
womman.  
<span id="an_1046A"></span> It moste eek been continued with the werkes
of charitee.  
<span id="an_1047"></span> It avayleth eek agayn the vices of the soule,
for, as seith Seint Jerome,  
<span id="an_1047A"></span> "By fastynge been saved the vices of the
flessh, and by preyere the vices of the soule."  
<span id="an_1048"></span> After this, thou shalt understonde that
bodily peyne stant in wakynge, for Jhesu Crist seith,  
<span id="an_1048A"></span> "Waketh and preyeth, that ye ne entre in
wikked temptacioun."  
<span id="an_1049"></span> Ye shul understanden also that fastynge stant
in thre thynges: in forberynge of bodily mete and drynke, and in
forberynge of worldly jolitee,  
<span id="an_1049A"></span> and in forberynge of deedly synne; this is
to seyn, that a man shal kepen hym fro deedly synne with al his myght.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1050">1050</span></span> And thou
shalt understanden eek that God ordeyned fastynge, and to fastynge
appertenen foure thinges:  
<span id="an_1051"></span> largenesse to povre folk, gladnesse of herte
espiritueel, nat to been angry ne anoyed, ne grucche for he fasteth,  
<span id="an_1051A"></span> and also resonable houre for to ete; ete by
mesure; that is for to seyn,  
<span id="an_1051B"></span> a man shal nat ete in untyme, ne sitte the
lenger at his table to ete for he fasteth.  
<span id="an_1052"></span> Thanne shaltow understonde that bodily peyne
stant in disciplyne or techynge, by word, or by writynge, or in
ensample;  
<span id="an_1052A"></span> also in werynge of heyres, or of stamyn, or
of haubergeons on hire naked flessh, for Cristes sake, and swiche manere
penances.  
<span id="an_1053"></span> But war thee wel that swiche manere penaunces
on thy flessh ne make nat thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of
thyself,  
<span id="an_1053A"></span> for bettre is to caste awey thyn heyre, than
for to caste awey the swetenesse of Jhesu Crist.  
<span id="an_1054"></span> And therfore seith Seint Paul, "Clothe yow,
as they that been chosen of God, in herte of misericorde, debonairetee,
suffraunce,  
<span id="an_1054A"></span> and swich manere of clothynge," of whiche
Jhesu Crist is moore apayed than of heyres, or haubergeouns, or
hauberkes.  
<span id="an_1055"></span> Thanne is discipline eek in knokkynge of thy
brest, in scourgynge with yerdes, in knelynges, in tribulacions,  
<span id="an_1056"></span> in suffrynge paciently wronges that been doon
to thee,  
<span id="an_1056A"></span> and eek in pacient suffraunce of maladies,
or lesynge of worldly catel, or of wyf, or of child, or othere
freendes.  
<span id="an_1057"></span> Thanne shaltow understonde whiche thynges
destourben penaunce; and this is in foure maneres:  
<span id="an_1057A"></span> that is, drede, shame, hope, and wanhope,
that is desperacion.  
<span id="an_1058"></span> And for to speke first of drede, for which he
weneth that he may suffre no penaunce;  
<span id="an_1059"></span> ther-agayns is remedie for to thynke that
bodily penaunce is but short and litel at regard of the peyne of
helle,  
<span id="an_1059A"></span> that is so crueel and so long that it
lasteth withouten ende.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060">1060</span></span> Now again
the shame that a man hath to shryven hym,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060A">1060A</span></span> and
namely thise ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han
no nede to shryven hem;  
<span id="an_1061"></span> agayns that shame sholde a man thynke that,
by wey of resoun, that he that hath nat been shamed to doon foule
thinges,  
<span id="an_1061A"></span> certes hym oghte nat been ashamed to do
faire thynges, and that is confessiouns.  
<span id="an_1062"></span> A man sholde eek thynke that God seeth and
woot alle his thoghtes and alle his werkes,  
<span id="an_1062A"></span> to hym may no thyng been hyd ne covered.  
<span id="an_1063"></span> Men sholden eek remembren hem of the shame
that is to come at the day of doom  
<span id="an_1063A"></span> to hem that been nat penitent and shryven in
this present lyf.  
<span id="an_1064"></span> For alle the creatures in hevene, in erthe,
and in helle shullen seen apertly al that they hyden in this world.  
<span id="an_1065"></span> Now for to speken of the hope of hem that
been necligent and slowe to shryven hem, that stant in two maneres.  
<span id="an_1066"></span> That oon is that he hopeth for to lyve longe
and for to purchacen muche richesse for his delit,  
<span id="an_1066A"></span> and thanne he wol shryven hym; and, as he
seith, hym semeth thanne tymely ynough to come to shrifte.  
<span id="an_1067"></span> Another is of surquidrie that he hath in
Cristes mercy.  
<span id="an_1068"></span> Agayns the firste vice, he shal thynke that
oure lif is in no sikernesse,  
<span id="an_1068A"></span> and eek that alle the richesses in this
world ben in aventure and passen as a shadwe on the wal;  
<span id="an_1069"></span> and, as seith Seint Gregorie, that it
aperteneth to the grete rightwisnesse of God that  
<span id="an_1069A"></span> nevere shal the peyne stynte of hem that
nevere wolde withdrawen hem fro synne, hir thankes,  
<span id="an_1069B"></span> but ay continue in synne; for thilke
perpetueel wil to do synne shul they han perpetueel peyne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070">1070</span></span> Wanhope is
in two maneres: the firste wanhope is in the mercy of Crist;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070A">1070A</span></span> that
oother is that they thynken that they ne myghte nat longe persevere in
goodnesse.  
<span id="an_1071"></span> The firste wanhope comth of that he demeth
that he hath synned so greetly and so ofte,  
<span id="an_1071A"></span> and so longe leyn in synne, that he shal nat
be saved.  
<span id="an_1072"></span> Certes, agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he
thynke that  
<span id="an_1072A"></span> the passion of Jhesu Crist is moore strong
for to unbynde than synne is strong for to bynde.  
<span id="an_1073"></span> Agayns the seconde wanhope he shal thynke
that as ofte as he falleth he may arise agayn by penitence.  
<span id="an_1073A"></span> And though he never so longe have leyn in
synne, the mercy of Crist is alwey redy to receiven hym to mercy.  
<span id="an_1074"></span> Agayns the wanhope that he demeth that he
sholde nat longe persevere in goodnesse,  
<span id="an_1074A"></span> he shal thynke that the feblesse of the
devel may nothyng doon, but if men wol suffren hym;  
<span id="an_1075"></span> and eek he shal han strengthe of the help of
God,  
<span id="an_1075A"></span> and of al hooly chirche, and of the
proteccioun of aungels, if hym list.  
<span id="an_1076"></span> Thanne shal men understonde what is the fruyt
of penaunce; and, after the word of Jhesu Crist,  
<span id="an_1076A"></span> it is the endelees blisse of hevene,  
<span id="an_1077"></span> ther joye hath no contrarioustee of wo ne
grevaunce; ther alle harmes been passed of this present lyf;  
<span id="an_1077A"></span> ther as is the sikernesse fro the peyne of
helle; ther as is the blisful compaignye  
<span id="an_1077B"></span> that rejoysen hem everemo, everich of
otheres joye;  
<span id="an_1078"></span> ther as the body of man, that whilom was foul
and derk, is moore cleer than the sonne;  
<span id="an_1078A"></span> ther as the body, that whilom was syk,
freele, and fieble, and mortal, is inmortal,  
<span id="an_1078B"></span> and so strong and so hool that ther may no
thyng apeyren it;  
<span id="an_1079"></span> ther as ne is neither hunger, thurst, ne
coold, but every soule replenyssed with the sighte of the parfit
knowynge of God.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080">1080</span></span> This
blisful regne may men purchace by poverte espiritueel, and the glorie by
lowenesse, the plentee of joye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080A">1080A</span></span> by hunger
and thurst, and the reste by travaille, and the lyf by deeth and
mortificacion of synne.  
<span id="an_1081"></span> Now preye I to hem alle that herkne this
litel tretys or rede,  
<span id="an_1081A"></span> that if ther be any thyng in it that liketh
hem,  
<span id="an_1081B"></span> that therof they thanken oure Lord Jhesu
Crist, of whom procedeth al wit and al goodnesse.  
<span id="an_1082"></span> And if ther be any thyng that displese hem, I
preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute  
<span id="an_1082A"></span> of myn unkonnynge and nat to my wyl, that
wolde ful fayn have seyd bettre if I hadde had konnynge.  
<span id="an_1083"></span> For oure book seith, "Al that is writen is
writen for oure doctrine,"  
<span id="an_1083A"></span> and that is myn entente.  
<span id="an_1084"></span> Wherfore I biseke yow mekely, for the mercy
of God,  
<span id="an_1084A"></span> that ye preye for me that Crist have mercy
on me and foryeve me my giltes;  
<span id="an_1085"></span> and namely of my translacions and enditynges
of worldly vanitees, the whiche I revoke in my retracciouns:  
<span id="an_1086"></span> as is the book of Troilus; the book also of
Fame;  
<span id="an_1086A"></span> the book of the XXV. Ladies; the book of the
Duchesse;  
<span id="an_1086B"></span> the book of Seint Valentynes day of the
Parlement of Briddes; the tales of Caunterbury, thilke that sownen into
synne;  
<span id="an_1087"></span> the book of the Leoun; and many another book,
if they were in my remembrance, and many a song  
<span id="an_1087A"></span> and many a leccherous lay, that Crist for
his grete mercy foryeve me the synne.  
<span id="an_1088"></span> But of the translacion of Boece de
Consolacione, and othere bookes of legendes of seintes, and omelies, and
moralitee, and devocioun,  
<span id="an_1089"></span> that thanke I oure Lord Jhesu Crist and his
blisful Mooder, and alle the seintes of hevene,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090">1090</span></span> bisekynge
hem that they from hennes forth unto my lyves ende sende me grace to
biwayle my giltes and to studie  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090A">1090A</span></span> to the
salvacioun of my soule, and graunte me grace of verray penitence,
confessioun and satisfaccioun to doon in this present lyf,  
<span id="an_1091"></span> thurgh the benigne grace of hym that is kyng
of kynges and preest over alle preestes,  
<span id="an_1091A"></span> that boghte us with the precious blood of
his herte,  
<span id="an_1092"></span> so that I may been oon of hem at the day of
doom that shulle be saved.  
<span id="an_1092A"></span> Qui cum Patre et Spiritu Sancto vivit et
regnat Deus per omnia secula. Amen.
