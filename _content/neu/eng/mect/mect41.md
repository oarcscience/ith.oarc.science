### The Second Nun's Tale

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_120">120</span></span> This mayden
bright Cecilie, as hir lif seith,  
<span id="an_121"></span> Was comen of Romayns and of noble kynde,  
<span id="an_122"></span> And from hir cradel up fostred in the feith  
<span id="an_123"></span> Of Crist, and bar his gospel in hir mynde.  
<span id="an_124"></span> She nevere cessed, as I writen fynde,  
<span id="an_125"></span> Of hir preyere and God to love and drede,  
<span id="an_126"></span> Bisekynge hym to kepe hir maydenhede.  
<span id="an_127"></span> And whan this mayden sholde unto a man  
<span id="an_128"></span> Ywedded be, that was ful yong of age,  
<span id="an_129"></span> Which that ycleped was Valerian,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span> And day was
comen of hir marriage,  
<span id="an_131"></span> She, ful devout and humble in hir corage,  
<span id="an_132"></span> Under hir robe of gold, that sat ful faire,  
<span id="an_133"></span> Hadde next hire flessh yclad hire in an
haire.  
<span id="an_134"></span> And whil the organs maden melodie,  
<span id="an_135"></span> To God allone in herte thus sang she:  
<span id="an_136"></span> "O Lord, my soule and eek my body gye  
<span id="an_137"></span> Unwemmed, lest that I confounded be."  
<span id="an_138"></span> And for his love that dyde upon a tree  
<span id="an_139"></span> Every seconde and thridde day she faste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span> Ay biddynge
in hire orisons ful faste.  
<span id="an_141"></span> The nyght cam, and to bedde moste she gon  
<span id="an_142"></span> With hire housbonde, as ofte is the manere,  
<span id="an_143"></span> And pryvely to hym she seyde anon,  
<span id="an_144"></span> "O sweete and wel biloved spouse deere,  
<span id="an_145"></span> Ther is a conseil, and ye wolde it heere,  
<span id="an_146"></span> Which that right fayn I wolde unto yow seye,  
<span id="an_147"></span> So that ye swere ye shul it nat biwreye."  
<span id="an_148"></span> Valerian gan faste unto hire swere  
<span id="an_149"></span> That for no cas ne thyng that myghte be,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span> He sholde
nevere mo biwreyen here;  
<span id="an_151"></span> And thanne at erst to hym thus seyde she:  
<span id="an_152"></span> "I have an aungel which that loveth me,  
<span id="an_153"></span> That with greet love, wher so I wake or
sleepe,  
<span id="an_154"></span> Is redy ay my body for to kepe.  
<span id="an_155"></span> "And if that he may feelen, out of drede,  
<span id="an_156"></span> That ye me touche, or love in vileynye,  
<span id="an_157"></span> He right anon wol sle yow with the dede,  
<span id="an_158"></span> And in youre yowthe thus ye shullen dye;  
<span id="an_159"></span> And if that ye in clene love me gye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_160">160</span></span> He wol yow
loven as me, for youre clennesse,  
<span id="an_161"></span> And shewen yow his joye and his
brightnesse."  
<span id="an_162"></span> Valerian, corrected as God wolde,  
<span id="an_163"></span> Answerde agayn, "If I shal trusten thee,  
<span id="an_164"></span> Lat me that aungel se and hym biholde;  
<span id="an_165"></span> And if that it a verray angel bee,  
<span id="an_166"></span> Thanne wol I doon as thou hast prayed me;  
<span id="an_167"></span> And if thou love another man, for sothe  
<span id="an_168"></span> Right with this swerd thanne wol I sle yow
bothe."  
<span id="an_169"></span> Cecile answerde anon-right in this wise:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_170">170</span></span> "If that yow
list, the angel shul ye see,  
<span id="an_171"></span> So that ye trowe on Crist and yow baptize.  
<span id="an_172"></span> Gooth forth to Via Apia," quod shee,  
<span id="an_173"></span> "That fro this toun ne stant but miles
three,  
<span id="an_174"></span> And to the povre folkes that ther dwelle,  
<span id="an_175"></span> Sey hem right thus, as that I shal yow
telle.  
<span id="an_176"></span> "Telle hem that I, Cecile, yow to hem sente  
<span id="an_177"></span> To shewen yow the goode Urban the olde,  
<span id="an_178"></span> For secree nedes and for good entente.  
<span id="an_179"></span> And whan that ye Seint Urban han biholde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_180">180</span></span> Telle hym the
wordes whiche I to yow tolde;  
<span id="an_181"></span> And whan that he hath purged yow fro synne,  
<span id="an_182"></span> Thanne shul ye se that angel, er ye twynne."  
<span id="an_183"></span> Valerian is to the place ygon,  
<span id="an_184"></span> And right as hym was taught by his lernynge,  
<span id="an_185"></span> He foond this hooly olde Urban anon  
<span id="an_186"></span> Among the seintes buryeles lotynge.  
<span id="an_187"></span> And he anon withouten tariynge  
<span id="an_188"></span> Dide his message; and whan that he it tolde,  
<span id="an_189"></span> Urban for joye his handes gan up holde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_190">190</span></span> The teeris
from his eyen leet he falle.  
<span id="an_191"></span> "Almyghty Lord, O Jhesu Crist," quod he,  
<span id="an_192"></span> "Sower of chaast conseil, hierde of us alle,  
<span id="an_193"></span> The fruyt of thilke seed of chastitee  
<span id="an_194"></span> That thou hast sowe in Cecile, taak to thee!  
<span id="an_195"></span> Lo, lyk a bisy bee, withouten gile,  
<span id="an_196"></span> Thee serveth ay thyn owene thral Cecile.  
<span id="an_197"></span> "For thilke spouse that she took but now  
<span id="an_198"></span> Ful lyk a fiers leoun, she sendeth heere,  
<span id="an_199"></span> As meke as evere was any lomb, to yow!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_200">200</span></span> And with that
word anon ther gan appeere  
<span id="an_201"></span> An oold man, clad in white clothes cleere,  
<span id="an_202"></span> That hadde a book with lettre of gold in
honde,  
<span id="an_203"></span> And gan bifore Valerian to stonde.  
<span id="an_204"></span> Valerian as deed fil doun for drede  
<span id="an_205"></span> Whan he hym saugh, and he up hente hym tho,  
<span id="an_206"></span> And on his book right thus he gan to rede:  
<span id="an_207"></span> "O Lord, o feith, o God, withouten mo,  
<span id="an_208"></span> O Cristendom, and Fader of alle also,  
<span id="an_209"></span> Aboven alle and over alle everywhere."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_210">210</span></span> Thise wordes
al with gold ywriten were.  
<span id="an_211"></span> Whan this was rad, thanne seyde this olde
man,  
<span id="an_212"></span> "Leevestow this thyng or no? Sey ye or nay."  
<span id="an_213"></span> "I leeve al this thyng," quod Valerian,  
<span id="an_214"></span> "For sother thyng than this, I dar wel say,  
<span id="an_215"></span> Under the hevene no wight thynke may."  
<span id="an_216"></span> Tho vanysshed this olde man, he nyste where,  
<span id="an_217"></span> And Pope Urban hym cristned right there.  
<span id="an_218"></span> Valerian gooth hoom and fynt Cecilie  
<span id="an_219"></span> Withinne his chambre with an angel stonde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_220">220</span></span> This angel
hadde of roses and of lilie  
<span id="an_221"></span> Corones two, the which he bar in honde;  
<span id="an_222"></span> And first to Cecile, as I understonde,  
<span id="an_223"></span> He yaf that oon, and after gan he take  
<span id="an_224"></span> That oother to Valerian, hir make.  
<span id="an_225"></span> "With body clene and with unwemmed thoght  
<span id="an_226"></span> Kepeth ay wel thise corones," quod he;  
<span id="an_227"></span> "Fro paradys to yow have I hem broght,  
<span id="an_228"></span> Ne nevere mo ne shal they roten bee,  
<span id="an_229"></span> Ne lese hir soote savour, trusteth me;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_230">230</span></span> Ne nevere
wight shal seen hem with his ye,  
<span id="an_231"></span> But he be chaast and hate vileynye.  
<span id="an_232"></span> "And thow, Valerian, for thow so soone  
<span id="an_233"></span> Assentedest to good conseil also,  
<span id="an_234"></span> Sey what thee list, and thou shalt han thy
boone."  
<span id="an_235"></span> "I have a brother," quod Valerian tho,  
<span id="an_236"></span> "That in this world I love no man so.  
<span id="an_237"></span> I pray yow that my brother may han grace  
<span id="an_238"></span> To knowe the trouthe, as I do in this
place."  
<span id="an_239"></span> The angel seyde, "God liketh thy requeste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_240">240</span></span> And bothe
with the palm of martirdom  
<span id="an_241"></span> Ye shullen come unto his blisful feste."  
<span id="an_242"></span> And with that word Tiburce his brother coom.  
<span id="an_243"></span> And whan that he the savour undernoom,  
<span id="an_244"></span> Which that the roses and the lilies caste,  
<span id="an_245"></span> Withinne his herte he gan to wondre faste,  
<span id="an_246"></span> And seyde, "I wondre, this tyme of the yeer,  
<span id="an_247"></span> Whennes that soote savour cometh so  
<span id="an_248"></span> Of rose and lilies that I smelle heer.  
<span id="an_249"></span> For though I hadde hem in myne handes two,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_250">250</span></span> The savour
myghte in me no depper go.  
<span id="an_251"></span> The sweete smel that in myn herte I fynde  
<span id="an_252"></span> Hath chaunged me al in another kynde."  
<span id="an_253"></span> Valerian seyde: "Two corones han we,  
<span id="an_254"></span> Snow white and rose reed, that shynen
cleere,  
<span id="an_255"></span> Whiche that thyne eyen han no myght to see;  
<span id="an_256"></span> And as thou smellest hem thurgh my preyere,  
<span id="an_257"></span> So shaltow seen hem, leeve brother deere,  
<span id="an_258"></span> If it so be thou wolt, withouten slouthe,  
<span id="an_259"></span> Bileve aright and knowen verray trouthe."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_260">260</span></span> Tiburce
answerde, "Seistow this to me  
<span id="an_261"></span> In soothnesse, or in dreem I herkne this?"  
<span id="an_262"></span> "In dremes," quod Valerian, "han we be  
<span id="an_263"></span> Unto this tyme, brother myn, ywis.  
<span id="an_264"></span> But now at erst in trouthe oure dwellyng
is."  
<span id="an_265"></span> "How woostow this?" quod Tiburce, "and in what
wyse?"  
<span id="an_266"></span> Quod Valerian, "That shal I thee devyse.  
<span id="an_267"></span> "The aungel of God hath me the trouthe
ytaught  
<span id="an_268"></span> Which thou shalt seen, if that thou wolt
reneye  
<span id="an_269"></span> The ydoles and be clene, and elles naught."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> And of the
myracle of thise corones tweye  
<span id="an_271"></span> Seint Ambrose in his preface list to seye;  
<span id="an_272"></span> Solempnely this noble doctour deere  
<span id="an_273"></span> Commendeth it, and seith in this manere:  
<span id="an_274"></span> "The palm of martirdom for to receyve,  
<span id="an_275"></span> Seinte Cecile, fulfild of Goddes yifte,  
<span id="an_276"></span> The world and eek hire chambre gan she
weyve;  
<span id="an_277"></span> Witnesse Tyburces and \[Valerians\] shrifte,  
<span id="an_278"></span> To whiche God of his bountee wolde shifte  
<span id="an_279"></span> Corones two of floures wel smellynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> And made his
angel hem the corones brynge.  
<span id="an_281"></span> "The mayde hath broght thise men to blisse
above;  
<span id="an_282"></span> The world hath wist what it is worth,
certeyn,  
<span id="an_283"></span> Devocioun of chastitee to love."  
<span id="an_284"></span> Tho shewed hym Cecile al open and pleyn  
<span id="an_285"></span> That alle ydoles nys but a thyng in veyn,  
<span id="an_286"></span> For they been dombe, and therto they been
deve,  
<span id="an_287"></span> And charged hym his ydoles for to leve.  
<span id="an_288"></span> "Whoso that troweth nat this, a beest he
is,"  
<span id="an_289"></span> Quod tho Tiburce, "if that I shal nat lye."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> And she gan
kisse his brest, that herde this,  
<span id="an_291"></span> And was ful glad he koude trouthe espye.  
<span id="an_292"></span> "This day I take thee for myn allye,"  
<span id="an_293"></span> Seyde this blisful faire mayde deere,  
<span id="an_294"></span> And after that she seyde as ye may heere:  
<span id="an_295"></span> "Lo, right so as the love of Crist," quod
she,  
<span id="an_296"></span> "Made me thy brotheres wyf, right in that
wise  
<span id="an_297"></span> Anon for myn allye heer take I thee,  
<span id="an_298"></span> Syn that thou wolt thyne ydoles despise.  
<span id="an_299"></span> Go with thy brother now, and thee baptise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> And make thee
clene, so that thou mowe biholde  
<span id="an_301"></span> The angels face of which thy brother tolde."  
<span id="an_302"></span> Tiburce answerde and seyde, "Brother deere,  
<span id="an_303"></span> First tel me whider I shal, and to what
man?"  
<span id="an_304"></span> "To whom?" quod he, "com forth with right good
cheere,  
<span id="an_305"></span> I wol thee lede unto the Pope Urban."  
<span id="an_306"></span> "Til Urban? Brother myn Valerian,"  
<span id="an_307"></span> Quod tho Tiburce, "woltow me thider lede?  
<span id="an_308"></span> Me thynketh that it were a wonder dede.  
<span id="an_309"></span> "Ne menestow nat Urban," quod he tho,

ofte dampned to be deed,  
<span id="an_311"></span> And woneth in halkes alwey to and fro,  
<span id="an_312"></span> And dar nat ones putte forth his heed?  
<span id="an_313"></span> Men sholde hym brennen in a fyr so reed

<span id="an_329"></span> Hath sowled hem, withouten any drede.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> "By word and
by myracle heigh Goddes Sone,  
<span id="an_331"></span> Whan he was in this world, declared heere  
<span id="an_332"></span> That ther was oother lyf ther men may wone."  
<span id="an_333"></span> To whom answerde Tiburce, "O suster deere,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> With preestes
that hem cristned alle yfeere;  
<span id="an_381"></span> And afterward, whan day was woxen light,  
<span id="an_382"></span> Cecile hem seyde with a ful stedefast
cheere,  
<span id="an_383"></span> "Now, Cristes owene knyghtes leeve and
deere,  
<span id="an_384"></span> Cast alle awey the werkes of derknesse,  
<span id="an_385"></span> And armeth yow in armure of brightnesse.  
<span id="an_386"></span> "Ye han for sothe ydoon a greet bataille,  
<span id="an_387"></span> Youre cours is doon, youre feith han ye
conserved.  
<span id="an_388"></span> Gooth to the corone of lif that may nat
faille;  
<span id="an_389"></span> The rightful Juge, which that ye han served,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> Shal yeve it
yow, as ye han it deserved."  
<span id="an_391"></span> And whan this thyng was seyd as I devyse,  
<span id="an_392"></span> Men ledde hem forth to doon the sacrefise.  
<span id="an_393"></span> But whan they weren to the place broght  
<span id="an_394"></span> To tellen shortly the conclusioun,  
<span id="an_395"></span> They nolde encense ne sacrifise right noght,  
<span id="an_396"></span> But on hir knees they setten hem adoun  
<span id="an_397"></span> With humble herte and sad devocioun,  
<span id="an_398"></span> And losten bothe hir hevedes in the place.  
<span id="an_399"></span> Hir soules wenten to the Kyng of grace.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> This Maximus,
that saugh this thyng bityde,  
<span id="an_401"></span> With pitous teeris tolde it anonright,  
<span id="an_402"></span> That he hir soules saugh to hevene glyde  
<span id="an_403"></span> With aungels ful of cleernesse and of light,  
<span id="an_404"></span> And with his word converted many a wight;  
<span id="an_405"></span> For which Almachius dide hym so bete  
<span id="an_406"></span> With whippe of leed til he his lif gan lete.  
<span id="an_407"></span> Cecile hym took and buryed hym anon  
<span id="an_408"></span> By Tiburce and Valerian softely  
<span id="an_409"></span> Withinne hire buriyng place, under the
stoon;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_410">410</span></span> And after
this, Almachius hastily  
<span id="an_411"></span> Bad his ministres fecchen openly  
<span id="an_412"></span> Cecile, so that she myghte in his presence  
<span id="an_413"></span> Doon sacrifice and Juppiter encense.  
<span id="an_414"></span> But they, converted at hir wise loore,  
<span id="an_415"></span> Wepten ful soore, and yaven ful credence  
<span id="an_416"></span> Unto hire word, and cryden moore and moore,  
<span id="an_417"></span> "Crist, Goddes Sone, withouten difference,  
<span id="an_418"></span> Is verray God -- this is al oure sentence --  
<span id="an_419"></span> That hath so good a servant hym to serve.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_420">420</span></span> This with o
voys we trowen, thogh we sterve!"  
<span id="an_421"></span> Almachius, that herde of this doynge,  
<span id="an_422"></span> Bad fecchen Cecile, that he myghte hire see,  
<span id="an_423"></span> And alderfirst, lo, this was his axynge.  
<span id="an_424"></span> "What maner womman artow?" tho quod he.  
<span id="an_425"></span> "I am a gentil womman born," quod she.  
<span id="an_426"></span> "I axe thee," quod he, "though it thee
greeve,  
<span id="an_427"></span> Of thy religioun and of thy bileeve."  
<span id="an_428"></span> "Ye han bigonne youre questioun folily,"  
<span id="an_429"></span> Quod she, "that wolden two answeres conclude  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> In o demande;
ye axed lewedly."  
<span id="an_431"></span> Almache answerde unto that similitude,  
<span id="an_432"></span> "Of whennes comth thyn answeryng so rude?"  
<span id="an_433"></span> "Of whennes?" quod she, whan that she was
freyned,  
<span id="an_434"></span> "Of conscience and of good feith unfeyned."  
<span id="an_435"></span> Almachius seyde, "Ne takestow noon heede  
<span id="an_436"></span> Of my power?" And she answerde hym this:  
<span id="an_437"></span> "Youre myght," quod she, "ful litel is to
dreede,  
<span id="an_438"></span> For every mortal mannes power nys  
<span id="an_439"></span> But lyk a bladdre ful of wynd, ywys.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_440">440</span></span> For with a
nedles poynt, whan it is blowe,  
<span id="an_441"></span> May al the boost of it be leyd ful lowe."  
<span id="an_442"></span> "Ful wrongfully bigonne thow," quod he,  
<span id="an_443"></span> "And yet in wrong is thy perseveraunce.  
<span id="an_444"></span> Wostow nat how oure myghty princes free  
<span id="an_445"></span> Han thus comanded and maad ordinaunce  
<span id="an_446"></span> That every Cristen wight shal han penaunce  
<span id="an_447"></span> But if that he his Cristendom withseye,  
<span id="an_448"></span> And goon al quit, if he wole it reneye?"  
<span id="an_449"></span> "Yowre princes erren, as youre nobleye
dooth,"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_450">450</span></span> Quod tho
Cecile, "and with a wood sentence  
<span id="an_451"></span> Ye make us gilty, and it is nat sooth.  
<span id="an_452"></span> For ye, that knowen wel oure innocence,  
<span id="an_453"></span> For as muche as we doon a reverence  
<span id="an_454"></span> To Crist, and for we bere a Cristen name,  
<span id="an_455"></span> Ye putte on us a cryme and eek a blame.  
<span id="an_456"></span> "But we that knowen thilke name so  
<span id="an_457"></span> For vertuous, we may it nat withseye."  
<span id="an_458"></span> Almache answerde, "Chees oon of thise two:  
<span id="an_459"></span> Do sacrifice, or Cristendom reneye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_460">460</span></span> That thou
mowe now escapen by that weye."  
<span id="an_461"></span> At which the hooly blisful faire mayde  
<span id="an_462"></span> Gan for to laughe, and to the juge sayde:  
<span id="an_463"></span> "O juge, confus in thy nycetee,  
<span id="an_464"></span> Woltow that I reneye innocence,  
<span id="an_465"></span> To make me a wikked wight?" quod shee.  
<span id="an_466"></span> "Lo, he dissymuleth heere in audience;  
<span id="an_467"></span> He stareth, and woodeth in his advertence!"  
<span id="an_468"></span> To whom Almachius, "Unsely wrecche,  
<span id="an_469"></span> Ne woostow nat how fer my myght may
strecche?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_470">470</span></span> "Han noght

<span id="an_472"></span> To maken folk to dyen or to lyven?  
<span id="an_473"></span> Why spekestow so proudly thanne to me?"  
<span id="an_474"></span> "I speke noght but stedfastly," quod she;  
<span id="an_475"></span> "Nat proudly, for I seye, as for my syde,  
<span id="an_476"></span> We haten deedly thilke vice of pryde.  
<span id="an_477"></span> "And if thou drede nat a sooth to heere,  
<span id="an_478"></span> Thanne wol I shewe al openly, by right,

<span id="an_483"></span> Thou hast noon oother power ne no leve.  
<span id="an_484"></span> "But thou mayst seyn thy princes han thee
maked  
<span id="an_485"></span> Ministre of deeth; for if thou speke of mo,  
<span id="an_486"></span> Thou lyest, for thy power is ful naked."  
<span id="an_487"></span> "Do wey thy booldnesse," seyde Almachius
tho,  
<span id="an_488"></span> "And sacrifice to oure goddes er thou go!  
<span id="an_489"></span> I recche nat what wrong that thou me profre,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_490">490</span></span> For I kan

he.  
<span id="an_493"></span> Cecile answerde, "O nyce creature!  
<span id="an_494"></span> Thou seydest no word syn thou spak to me  
<span id="an_495"></span> That I ne knew therwith thy nycetee  
<span id="an_496"></span> And that thou were in every maner wise  
<span id="an_497"></span> A lewed officer and a veyn justise.  
<span id="an_498"></span> "Ther lakketh no thyng to thyne outter yen  
<span id="an_499"></span> That thou n' art blynd; for thyng that we seen

<span id="an_505"></span> "It is a shame that the peple shal

<span id="an_507"></span> For communly men woot it wel overal  
<span id="an_508"></span> That myghty God is in his hevenes hye;  
<span id="an_509"></span> And thise ymages, wel thou mayst espye,

<span id="an_511"></span> For in effect they been nat worth a myte."  
<span id="an_512"></span> Thise wordes and swiche othere seyde she,  
<span id="an_513"></span> And he weex wroth, and bad men sholde hir
lede  
<span id="an_514"></span> Hom til hir hous, and "In hire hous," quod
he,  
<span id="an_515"></span> "Brenne hire right in a bath of flambes
rede."  
<span id="an_516"></span> And as he bad, right so was doon the dede;  
<span id="an_517"></span> For in a bath they gonne hire faste shetten,  
<span id="an_518"></span> And nyght and day greet fyr they under

<span id="an_519"></span> The longe nyght, and eek a day also,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_520">520</span></span> For al the

<span id="an_521"></span> She sat al coold and feelede no wo.  
<span id="an_522"></span> It made hire nat a drope for to sweete.  
<span id="an_523"></span> But in that bath hir lyf she moste lete,  
<span id="an_524"></span> For he Almachius, with ful wikke entente,  
<span id="an_525"></span> To sleen hire in the bath his sonde sente.  
<span id="an_526"></span> Thre strokes in the nekke he smoot hire tho,

<span id="an_528"></span> He myghte noght smyte al hir nekke atwo;  
<span id="an_529"></span> And for ther was that tyme an ordinaunce

<span id="an_533"></span> But half deed, with hir nekke ycorven there,  
<span id="an_534"></span> He lefte hir lye, and on his wey he went.  
<span id="an_535"></span> The Cristen folk, which that aboute hire

<span id="an_536"></span> With sheetes han the blood ful faire yhent.  
<span id="an_537"></span> Thre dayes lyved she in this torment,  
<span id="an_538"></span> And nevere cessed hem the feith to teche  
<span id="an_539"></span> That she hadde fostred; hem she gan to

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_540">540</span></span> And hem she
yaf hir moebles and hir thyng,  
<span id="an_541"></span> And to the Pope Urban bitook hem tho,

<span id="an_547"></span> Seint Urban with his deknes prively  
<span id="an_548"></span> The body fette and buryed it by nyghte  
<span id="an_549"></span> Among his othere seintes honestly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_550">550</span></span> Hir hous the
