#### Troilus and Criseyde

### Book 2

<span id="an_1"></span> Owt of thise blake wawes for to saylle,  
<span id="an_2"></span> O wynd, o wynd, the weder gynneth clere;  
<span id="an_3"></span> For in this see the boot hath swych travaylle,  
<span id="an_4"></span> Of my connyng, that unneth I it steere.  
<span id="an_5"></span> This see clepe I the tempestous matere  
<span id="an_6"></span> Of disespeir that Troilus was inne;  
<span id="an_7"></span> But now of hope the kalendes bygynne.  
<span id="an_8"></span> O lady myn, that called art Cleo,  
<span id="an_9"></span> Thow be my speed fro this forth, and my Muse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> To ryme wel
this book til I have do;  
<span id="an_11"></span> Me nedeth here noon other art to use.  
<span id="an_12"></span> Forwhi to every lovere I me excuse,  
<span id="an_13"></span> That of no sentement I this endite,  
<span id="an_14"></span> But out of Latyn in my tonge it write.  
<span id="an_15"></span> Wherfore I nyl have neither thank ne blame  
<span id="an_16"></span> Of al this werk, but prey yow mekely,  
<span id="an_17"></span> Disblameth me if any word be lame,  
<span id="an_18"></span> For as myn auctour seyde, so sey I.  
<span id="an_19"></span> Ek though I speeke of love unfelyngly,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> No wondre is,
for it nothyng of newe is.  
<span id="an_21"></span> A blynd man kan nat juggen wel in hewis.  
<span id="an_22"></span> Ye knowe ek that in forme of speche is
chaunge  
<span id="an_23"></span> Withinne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho  
<span id="an_24"></span> That hadden pris, now wonder nyce and
straunge  
<span id="an_25"></span> Us thinketh hem, and yet thei spake hem so,  
<span id="an_26"></span> And spedde as wel in love as men now do;  
<span id="an_27"></span> Ek for to wynnen love in sondry ages,  
<span id="an_28"></span> In sondry londes, sondry ben usages.  
<span id="an_29"></span> And forthi if it happe in any wyse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> That here be
any lovere in this place  
<span id="an_31"></span> That herkneth, as the storie wol devise,  
<span id="an_32"></span> How Troilus com to his lady grace,  
<span id="an_33"></span> And thenketh, "So nold I nat love purchace,"  
<span id="an_34"></span> Or wondreth on his speche or his doynge,  
<span id="an_35"></span> I noot; but it is me no wonderynge.  
<span id="an_36"></span> For every wight which that to Rome went  
<span id="an_37"></span> Halt nat o path, or alwey o manere;  
<span id="an_38"></span> Ek in som lond were al the game shent,  
<span id="an_39"></span> If that they ferde in love as men don here,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> As thus, in
opyn doyng or in chere,  
<span id="an_41"></span> In visityng in forme, or seyde hire sawes;  
<span id="an_42"></span> Forthi men seyn, "Ecch contree hath his
lawes."  
<span id="an_43"></span> Ek scarsly ben ther in this place thre  
<span id="an_44"></span> That have in love seid lik, and don, in al;  
<span id="an_45"></span> For to thi purpos this may liken the,  
<span id="an_46"></span> And the right nought; yet al is seid or
schal;  
<span id="an_47"></span> Ek som men grave in tree, some in ston wal,  
<span id="an_48"></span> As it bitit. But syn I have bigonne,  
<span id="an_49"></span> Myn auctour shal I folwen, if I konne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> In May, that
moder is of monthes glade,  
<span id="an_51"></span> That fresshe floures, blew and white and
rede,  
<span id="an_52"></span> Ben quike agayn, that wynter dede made,  
<span id="an_53"></span> And ful of bawme is fletyng every mede,  
<span id="an_54"></span> Whan Phebus doth his bryghte bemes sprede  
<span id="an_55"></span> Right in the white Bole, it so bitidde,  
<span id="an_56"></span> As I shal synge, on Mayes day the thrydde,  
<span id="an_57"></span> That Pandarus, for al his wise speche,  
<span id="an_58"></span> Felt ek his part of loves shotes keene,  
<span id="an_59"></span> That, koude he nevere so wel of lovyng
preche,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> It made his
hewe a-day ful ofte greene.  
<span id="an_61"></span> So shop it that hym fil that day a teene  
<span id="an_62"></span> In love, for which in wo to bedde he wente,  
<span id="an_63"></span> And made, er it was day, ful many a wente.  
<span id="an_64"></span> The swalowe Proigne, with a sorowful lay,  
<span id="an_65"></span> Whan morwen com, gan make hire waymentynge  
<span id="an_66"></span> Whi she forshapen was; and evere lay  
<span id="an_67"></span> Pandare abedde, half in a slomberynge,  
<span id="an_68"></span> Til she so neigh hym made hire cheterynge  
<span id="an_69"></span> How Tereus gan forth hire suster take,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> That with the
noyse of hire he gan awake,  
<span id="an_71"></span> And gan to calle, and dresse hym up to ryse,  
<span id="an_72"></span> Remembryng hym his erand was to doone  
<span id="an_73"></span> From Troilus, and ek his grete emprise;  
<span id="an_74"></span> And caste and knew in good plit was the moone  
<span id="an_75"></span> To doon viage, and took his way ful soone  
<span id="an_76"></span> Unto his neces palays ther biside.  
<span id="an_77"></span> Now Janus, god of entree, thow hym gyde!  
<span id="an_78"></span> Whan he was come unto his neces place,  
<span id="an_79"></span> "Wher is my lady?" to hire folk quod he;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> And they hym

<span id="an_81"></span> And fond two othere ladys sete and she,

<span id="an_84"></span> Of the siege of Thebes, while hem leste.  
<span id="an_85"></span> Quod Pandarus, "Madame, God yow see,  
<span id="an_86"></span> With youre book and all the compaignie!"  
<span id="an_87"></span> "Ey, uncle myn, welcome iwys," quod she;  
<span id="an_88"></span> And up she roos, and by the hond in hye  
<span id="an_89"></span> She took hym faste, and seyde, "This nyght

<span id="an_91"></span> And with that word she doun on bench hym

be  
<span id="an_623"></span> That shal bityden of necessitee.  
<span id="an_624"></span> This Troilus sat on his baye steede

<span id="an_626"></span> And wownded was his hors, and gan to blede,  
<span id="an_627"></span> On which he rood a pas ful softely.  
<span id="an_628"></span> But swich a knyghtly sighte trewely  
<span id="an_629"></span> As was on hym, was nought, withouten faille,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_630">630</span></span> To loke on
Mars, that god is of bataille.  
<span id="an_631"></span> So lik a man of armes and a knyght  
<span id="an_632"></span> He was to seen, fulfilled of heigh prowesse,  
<span id="an_633"></span> For bothe he hadde a body and a myght  
<span id="an_634"></span> To don that thing, as wel as hardynesse;  
<span id="an_635"></span> And ek to seen hym in his gere hym dresse,  
<span id="an_636"></span> So fressh, so yong, so weldy semed he,  
<span id="an_637"></span> It was an heven upon hym for to see.  
<span id="an_638"></span> His helm tohewen was in twenty places,  
<span id="an_639"></span> That by a tyssew heng his bak byhynde;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_640">640</span></span> His sheeld
todasshed was with swerdes and maces,  
<span id="an_641"></span> In which men myghte many an arwe fynde  
<span id="an_642"></span> That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rynde;  
<span id="an_643"></span> And ay the peple cryde, "Here cometh oure
joye,  
<span id="an_644"></span> And, next his brother, holder up of Troye!"  
<span id="an_645"></span> For which he wex a litel reed for shame  
<span id="an_646"></span> When he the peple upon hym herde cryen,  
<span id="an_647"></span> That to byholde it was a noble game  
<span id="an_648"></span> How sobrelich he caste down his yen.  
<span id="an_649"></span> Criseyda gan al his chere aspien,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_650">650</span></span> And leet it
so softe in hire herte synke,  
<span id="an_651"></span> That to hireself she seyde, "Who yaf me
drynke?"  
<span id="an_652"></span> For of hire owen thought she wex al reed,  
<span id="an_653"></span> Remembryng hire right thus, "Lo, this is he  
<span id="an_654"></span> Which that myn uncle swerith he moot be
deed,  
<span id="an_655"></span> But I on hym have mercy and pitee."  
<span id="an_656"></span> And with that thought, for pure ashamed, she  
<span id="an_657"></span> Gan in hire hed to pulle, and that as faste,  
<span id="an_658"></span> Whil he and alle the peple forby paste,  
<span id="an_659"></span> And gan to caste and rollen up and down  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_660">660</span></span> Withinne hire
thought his excellent prowesse,  
<span id="an_661"></span> And his estat, and also his renown,  
<span id="an_662"></span> His wit, his shap, and ek his gentilesse;  
<span id="an_663"></span> But moost hire favour was, for his distresse  
<span id="an_664"></span> Was al for hire, and thoughte it was a
routhe  
<span id="an_665"></span> To sleen swich oon, if that he mente
trouthe.  
<span id="an_666"></span> Now myghte som envious jangle thus:  
<span id="an_667"></span> "This was a sodeyn love; how myght it be  
<span id="an_668"></span> That she so lightly loved Troilus  
<span id="an_669"></span> Right for the firste syghte, ye, parde?"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_670">670</span></span> Now whoso
seith so, mote he nevere ythe!  
<span id="an_671"></span> For every thing a gynnyng hath it nede  
<span id="an_672"></span> Er al be wrought, withowten any drede.  
<span id="an_673"></span> For I sey nought that she so sodeynly  
<span id="an_674"></span> Yaf hym hire love, but that she gan enclyne  
<span id="an_675"></span> To like hym first, and I have told yow whi;  
<span id="an_676"></span> And after that, his manhod and his pyne  
<span id="an_677"></span> Made love withinne hire for to myne,  
<span id="an_678"></span> For which by proces and by good servyse  
<span id="an_679"></span> He gat hire love, and in no sodeyn wyse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_680">680</span></span> And also
blisful Venus, wel arrayed,  
<span id="an_681"></span> Sat in hire seventhe hous of hevene tho,  
<span id="an_682"></span> Disposed wel, and with aspectes payed,  
<span id="an_683"></span> To helpe sely Troilus of his woo.  
<span id="an_684"></span> And soth to seyne, she nas not al a foo  
<span id="an_685"></span> To Troilus in his nativitee;  
<span id="an_686"></span> God woot that wel the sonner spedde he.  
<span id="an_687"></span> Now lat us stynte of Troilus a throwe,  
<span id="an_688"></span> That rideth forth, and lat us torne faste  
<span id="an_689"></span> Unto Criseyde, that heng hire hed ful lowe  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_690">690</span></span> Ther as she
sat allone, and gan to caste  
<span id="an_691"></span> Where on she wolde apoynte hire atte laste,  
<span id="an_692"></span> If it so were hire em ne wolde cesse  
<span id="an_693"></span> For Troilus upon hire for to presse.  
<span id="an_694"></span> And, Lord! So she gan in hire thought argue  
<span id="an_695"></span> In this matere of which I have yow told,  
<span id="an_696"></span> And what to doone best were, and what
eschue,  
<span id="an_697"></span> That plited she ful ofte in many fold.  
<span id="an_698"></span> Now was hire herte warm, now was it cold;  
<span id="an_699"></span> And what she thoughte somwhat shal I write,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_700">700</span></span> As to myn
auctour listeth for t' endite.  
<span id="an_701"></span> She thoughte wel that Troilus persone  
<span id="an_702"></span> She knew by syghte, and ek his gentilesse,  
<span id="an_703"></span> And thus she seyde, "Al were it nat to doone  
<span id="an_704"></span> To graunte hym love, yet for his worthynesse  
<span id="an_705"></span> It were honour with pley and with gladnesse  
<span id="an_706"></span> In honestee with swich a lord to deele,  
<span id="an_707"></span> For myn estat, and also for his heele.  
<span id="an_708"></span> "Ek wel woot I my kynges sone is he,  
<span id="an_709"></span> And sith he hath to se me swich delit,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_710">710</span></span> If I wolde
outreliche his sighte flee,  
<span id="an_711"></span> Peraunter he myghte have me in dispit,  
<span id="an_712"></span> Thorugh whicch I myghte stonde in worse

<span id="an_713"></span> Now were I wis, me hate to purchace,  
<span id="an_714"></span> Withouten need, ther I may stonde in grace?  
<span id="an_715"></span> "In every thyng, I woot, ther lith mesure;  
<span id="an_716"></span> For though a man forbede dronkenesse,  
<span id="an_717"></span> He naught forbet that every creature  
<span id="an_718"></span> Be drynkeles for alwey, as I gesse.  
<span id="an_719"></span> Ek sith I woot for me is his destresse,

nat for that thing hym despise,  
<span id="an_721"></span> Sith it is so he meneth in good wyse.  
<span id="an_722"></span> "And ek I knowe of longe tyme agon  
<span id="an_723"></span> His thewes goode, and that he is nat nyce;  
<span id="an_724"></span> N' avantour, seith men, certein, he is noon;  
<span id="an_725"></span> To wis is he to doon so gret a vice;  
<span id="an_726"></span> Ne als I nyl hym nevere so cherice  
<span id="an_727"></span> That he may make avaunt, by juste cause,  
<span id="an_728"></span> He shal me nevere bynde in swich a clause.  
<span id="an_729"></span> "Now sette a caas: the hardest is, ywys,

demen that he loveth me.  
<span id="an_731"></span> What dishonour were it unto me, this?  
<span id="an_732"></span> May ich hym lette of that? Why, nay, parde!  
<span id="an_733"></span> I knowe also, and alday heere and se,

Ector, which that is the beste;  
<span id="an_741"></span> And yet his lif al lith now in my cure.

<span id="an_748"></span> And so men seyn, in al the town of Troie.  
<span id="an_749"></span> What wonder is though he of me have joye?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750">750</span></span> "I am myn

<span id="an_759"></span> What, pardieux! I am naught religious.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_760">760</span></span> And though
that I myn herte sette at reste

<span id="an_762"></span> And kepe alwey myn honour and my name,  
<span id="an_763"></span> By alle right, it may do me no shame."  
<span id="an_764"></span> But right as when the sonne shyneth brighte  
<span id="an_765"></span> In March, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face,  
<span id="an_766"></span> And that a cloude is put with wynd to

<span id="an_767"></span> Which oversprat the sonne as for a space,  
<span id="an_768"></span> A cloudy thought gan thorugh hire soule

alle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> So that for
feere almost she gan to falle.  
<span id="an_771"></span> That thought was this: "Allas! Syn I am

<span id="an_778"></span> "For love is yet the mooste stormy lyf,

<span id="an_1297"></span> Yif that I may; this nyce opynyoun  
<span id="an_1298"></span> Shal nought be holden fully yeres two."  
<span id="an_1299"></span> What sholde I make of this a long sermoun?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300">1300</span></span> He moste
assente on that conclusioun,  
<span id="an_1301"></span> As for the tyme; and whan that it was eve,  
<span id="an_1302"></span> And al was wel, he roos and tok his leve.  
<span id="an_1303"></span> And on his wey ful faste homward he spedde,  
<span id="an_1304"></span> And right for joye he felte his herte
daunce;  
<span id="an_1305"></span> And Troilus he fond allone abedde,  
<span id="an_1306"></span> That lay, as do thise lovers, in a traunce  
<span id="an_1307"></span> Bitwixen hope and derk disesperaunce.  
<span id="an_1308"></span> But Pandarus, right at his in-comynge,  
<span id="an_1309"></span> He song, as who seyth, "Somwhat I brynge,"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1310">1310</span></span> And seyde,
"Who is in his bed so soone  
<span id="an_1311"></span> Iburied thus?" "It am I, frend," quod he.  
<span id="an_1312"></span> "Who, Troilus? Nay, help me so the moone,"  
<span id="an_1313"></span> Quod Pandarus, "thow shalt arise and see  
<span id="an_1314"></span> A charme that was sent right now to the,  
<span id="an_1315"></span> The which kan helen the of thyn accesse,  
<span id="an_1316"></span> If thow do forthwith al thi bisynesse."  
<span id="an_1317"></span> "Ye, thorugh the myght of God," quod
Troilus,  
<span id="an_1318"></span> And Pandarus gan hym the lettre take,  
<span id="an_1319"></span> And seyde, "Parde, God hath holpen us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1320">1320</span></span> Have here a
light, and loke on al this blake."  
<span id="an_1321"></span> But ofte gan the herte glade and quake  
<span id="an_1322"></span> Of Troilus, whil that he gan it rede,  
<span id="an_1323"></span> So as the wordes yave hym hope or drede.  
<span id="an_1324"></span> But finaly, he took al for the beste  
<span id="an_1325"></span> That she hym wroot, for somwhat he byheld  
<span id="an_1326"></span> On which hym thoughte he myghte his herte
reste,  
<span id="an_1327"></span> Al covered she tho wordes under sheld.  
<span id="an_1328"></span> Thus to the more worthi part he held,  
<span id="an_1329"></span> That what for hope and Pandarus byheste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1330">1330</span></span> His grete
wo foryede he at the leste.  
<span id="an_1331"></span> But as we may alday oureselven see,  
<span id="an_1332"></span> Thorugh more wode or col, the more fir,  
<span id="an_1333"></span> Right so encreese hope, of what it be,  
<span id="an_1334"></span> Therwith ful ofte encresseth ek desir;  
<span id="an_1335"></span> Or as an ook comth of a litil spir,  
<span id="an_1336"></span> So thorugh this lettre which that she hym

<span id="an_1337"></span> Encrescen gan desir, of which he brente.  
<span id="an_1338"></span> Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and nyght  
<span id="an_1339"></span> This Troilus gan to desiren moore  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1340">1340</span></span> Thanne he
did erst, thorugh hope, and did his myght  
<span id="an_1341"></span> To preessen on, as by Pandarus loore,  
<span id="an_1342"></span> And writen to hire of his sorwes soore.  
<span id="an_1343"></span> Fro day to day he leet it nought refreyde,  
<span id="an_1344"></span> That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seyde;  
<span id="an_1345"></span> And dide also his other observaunces  
<span id="an_1346"></span> That til a lovere longeth in this cas;  
<span id="an_1347"></span> And after that thise dees torned on
chaunces,  
<span id="an_1348"></span> So was he outher glad or seyde "Allas!"  
<span id="an_1349"></span> And held after his gistes ay his pas;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1350">1350</span></span> And after
swiche answeres as he hadde,  
<span id="an_1351"></span> So were his dayes sory outher gladde.  
<span id="an_1352"></span> But to Pandare alwey was his recours,  
<span id="an_1353"></span> And pitously gan ay tyl hym to pleyne,  
<span id="an_1354"></span> And hym bisoughte of reed and som socours.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1550">1550</span></span> To ben a
frend and helpyng to Criseyde.  
<span id="an_1551"></span> God woot that he it graunted anon-right,  
<span id="an_1552"></span> To ben hire fulle frend with al his myght.  
<span id="an_1553"></span> But swich a nede was to preye hym thenne,  
<span id="an_1554"></span> As for to bidde a wood man for to renne!  
<span id="an_1555"></span> The morwen com, and neighen gan the tyme  
<span id="an_1556"></span> Of meeltid, that the faire queene Eleyne  
<span id="an_1557"></span> Shoop hire to ben, an houre after the
prime,  
<span id="an_1558"></span> With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feyne;  
<span id="an_1559"></span> But as his suster, homly, soth to seyne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1560">1560</span></span> She com to

<span id="an_1561"></span> But God and Pandare wist al what this
mente.  
<span id="an_1562"></span> Com ek Criseyde, al innocent of this,  
<span id="an_1563"></span> Antigone, hire suster Tarbe also.  
<span id="an_1564"></span> But fle we now prolixitee best is,  
<span id="an_1565"></span> For love of God, and lat us faste go  
<span id="an_1566"></span> Right to th' effect, withouten tales mo,  
<span id="an_1567"></span> Whi al this folk assembled in this place;  
<span id="an_1568"></span> And lat us of hire saluynges pace.  
<span id="an_1569"></span> Gret honour did hem Deiphebus, certeyn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1570">1570</span></span> And fedde
hem wel with al that myghte like;  
<span id="an_1571"></span> But evere mo "Allas!" was his refreyn,  
<span id="an_1572"></span> "My goode brother Troilus, the syke,  
<span id="an_1573"></span> Lith yet" -- and therwithal he gan to sike;  
<span id="an_1574"></span> And after that, he peyned hym to glade  
<span id="an_1575"></span> Hem as he myghte, and cheere good he made.  
<span id="an_1576"></span> Compleyned ek Eleyne of his siknesse  
<span id="an_1577"></span> So feythfully that pite was to here,  
<span id="an_1578"></span> And every wight gan waxen for accesse  
<span id="an_1579"></span> A leche anon, and seyde, "In this manere  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1580">1580</span></span> Men curen

<span id="an_1581"></span> But ther sat oon, al list hire nought to

<span id="an_1582"></span> That thoughte, "Best koud I yet ben his

<span id="an_1583"></span> After compleynte, hym gonnen they to
preyse,  
<span id="an_1584"></span> As folk don yet whan som wight hath bygonne  
<span id="an_1585"></span> To preise a man, and up with pris hym reise  
<span id="an_1586"></span> A thousand fold yet heigher than the sonne:  
<span id="an_1587"></span> "He is, he kan, that fewe lordes konne."  
<span id="an_1588"></span> And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme,  
<span id="an_1589"></span> He naught forgat hire preisynge to

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1590">1590</span></span> Herde al

<span id="an_1591"></span> And every word gan for to notifie;  
<span id="an_1592"></span> For which with sobre cheere hire herte

<span id="an_1593"></span> For who is that ne wolde hire glorifie,  
<span id="an_1594"></span> To mowen swich a knyght don lyve or dye?  
<span id="an_1595"></span> But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle;  
<span id="an_1596"></span> For for o fyn is al that evere I telle.  
<span id="an_1597"></span> The tyme com fro dyner for to ryse,  
<span id="an_1598"></span> And as hem aughte, arisen everichon.  
<span id="an_1599"></span> And gonne a while of this and that devise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600">1600</span></span> But
Pandarus brak al that speche anon,  
<span id="an_1601"></span> And seide to Deiphebus, "Wol ye gon,  
<span id="an_1602"></span> If it youre wille be, as I yow preyde,  
<span id="an_1603"></span> To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?"  
<span id="an_1604"></span> Eleyne, which that by the hond hire held,  
<span id="an_1605"></span> Took first the tale, and seyde, "Go we
blyve";  
<span id="an_1606"></span> And goodly on Criseyde she biheld,  
<span id="an_1607"></span> And seyde, "Joves lat hym nevere thryve  
<span id="an_1608"></span> That doth yow harm, and brynge hym soone of

<span id="an_1609"></span> And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1610">1610</span></span> If that I

<span id="an_1611"></span> "Tel thow thi neces cas," quod Deiphebus  
<span id="an_1612"></span> To Pandarus, "for thow kanst best it
telle."  
<span id="an_1613"></span> "My lordes and my ladys, it stant thus:  
<span id="an_1614"></span> What sholde I lenger," quod he, "do yow
dwelle?"  
<span id="an_1615"></span> He rong hem out a proces lik a belle  
<span id="an_1616"></span> Upon hire foo that highte Poliphete,  
<span id="an_1617"></span> So heynous that men myghten on it spete.  
<span id="an_1618"></span> Answerde of this ech werse of hem than

<span id="an_1619"></span> And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1620">1620</span></span> "Anhonged

<span id="an_1621"></span> And so he shal, for it ne may nought

<span id="an_1622"></span> What shold I lenger in this tale tarien?  
<span id="an_1623"></span> Pleynliche, alle at ones, they hire highten  
<span id="an_1624"></span> To ben hire help in al that evere they

<span id="an_1625"></span> Spak than Eleyne, and seyde, "Pandarus,

<span id="an_1627"></span> I meene Ector -- or woot it Troilus?"  
<span id="an_1628"></span> He seyde, "Ye, but wole ye now me here?  
<span id="an_1629"></span> Me thynketh this, sith that Troilus is

<span id="an_1634"></span> And, by youre leve, I wol but in right

<span id="an_1639"></span> To smylen of this gan tho Troilus,

Pandarus, withouten rekenynge,  
<span id="an_1641"></span> Out wente anon to Eleyne and Deiphebus,
