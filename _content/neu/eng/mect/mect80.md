### Lenvoy de Chaucer a Bukton

<span id="an_1"></span> My maister Bukton, whan of Crist our kyng  
<span id="an_2"></span> Was axed what is trouthe or sothfastnesse,  
<span id="an_3"></span> He nat a word answerde to that axing,  
<span id="an_4"></span> As who saith, "No man is al trewe," I gesse.  
<span id="an_5"></span> And therfore, though I highte to expresse  
<span id="an_6"></span> The sorwe and wo that is in mariage,  
<span id="an_7"></span> I dar not writen of it no wikkednesse,  
<span id="an_8"></span> Lest I myself falle eft in swich dotage.  
<span id="an_9"></span> I wol nat seyn how that yt is the cheyne  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> Of Sathanas, on
which he gnaweth evere,  
<span id="an_11"></span> But I dar seyn, were he out of his peyne,  
<span id="an_12"></span> As by his wille he wolde be bounde nevere.  
<span id="an_13"></span> But thilke doted fool that eft hath levere  
<span id="an_14"></span> Ycheyned be than out of prison crepe,  
<span id="an_15"></span> God lete him never fro his wo dissevere,  
<span id="an_16"></span> Ne no man him bewayle, though he wepe.  
<span id="an_17"></span> But yet, lest thow do worse, take a wyf;  
<span id="an_18"></span> Bet ys to wedde than brenne in worse wise.  
<span id="an_19"></span> But thow shal have sorwe on thy flessh, thy
lyf,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> And ben thy
wives thral, as seyn these wise;  
<span id="an_21"></span> And yf that hooly writ may nat suffyse,  
<span id="an_22"></span> Experience shal the teche, so may happe,  
<span id="an_23"></span> That the were lever to be take in Frise  
<span id="an_24"></span> Than eft to falle of weddynge in the trappe.  
<span id="an_25"></span> This lytel writ, proverbes, or figure  
<span id="an_26"></span> I sende yow; take kepe of yt, I rede;  
<span id="an_27"></span> Unwys is he that kan no wele endure.  
<span id="an_28"></span> If thow be siker, put the nat in drede.  
<span id="an_29"></span> The Wyf of Bathe I pray yow that ye rede  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Of this matere
that we have on honde.  
<span id="an_31"></span> God graunte yow your lyf frely to lede  
<span id="an_32"></span> In fredam, for ful hard is to be bonde.
