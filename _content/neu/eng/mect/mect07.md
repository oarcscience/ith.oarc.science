#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Cook's Tale

<span id="an_4365"></span> A prentys whilom dwelled in oure citee,  
<span id="an_4366"></span> And of a craft of vitailliers was hee.  
<span id="an_4367"></span> Gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe,  
<span id="an_4368"></span> Broun as a berye, a propre short felawe,  
<span id="an_4369"></span> With lokkes blake, ykembd ful fetisly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4370">4370</span></span> Dauncen he
koude so wel and jolily  
<span id="an_4371"></span> That he was cleped Perkyn Revelour.  
<span id="an_4372"></span> He was as ful of love and paramour  
<span id="an_4373"></span> As is the hyve ful of hony sweete;  
<span id="an_4374"></span> Wel was the wenche with hym myghte meete.  
<span id="an_4375"></span> At every bridale wolde he synge and hoppe;  
<span id="an_4376"></span> He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe.  
<span id="an_4377"></span> For whan ther any ridyng was in Chepe,  
<span id="an_4378"></span> Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe --  
<span id="an_4379"></span> Til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4380">4380</span></span> And daunced
wel, he wolde nat come ayeyn --  
<span id="an_4381"></span> And gadered hym a meynee of his sort  
<span id="an_4382"></span> To hoppe and synge and maken swich disport;  
<span id="an_4383"></span> And ther they setten stevene for to meete,  
<span id="an_4384"></span> To pleyen at the dys in swich a streete.  
<span id="an_4385"></span> For in the toune nas ther no prentys  
<span id="an_4386"></span> That fairer koude caste a paire of dys  
<span id="an_4387"></span> Than Perkyn koude, and therto he was free  
<span id="an_4388"></span> Of his dispense, in place of pryvetee.  
<span id="an_4389"></span> That fond his maister wel in his chaffare,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4390">4390</span></span> For often
tyme he foond his box ful bare.  
<span id="an_4391"></span> For sikerly a prentys revelour  
<span id="an_4392"></span> That haunteth dys, riot, or paramour,  
<span id="an_4393"></span> His maister shal it in his shoppe abye,  
<span id="an_4394"></span> Al have he no part of the mynstralcye.  
<span id="an_4395"></span> For thefte and riot, they been convertible,  
<span id="an_4396"></span> Al konne he pleye on gyterne or ribible.  
<span id="an_4397"></span> Revel and trouthe, as in a lowe degree,  
<span id="an_4398"></span> They been ful wrothe al day, as men may
see.  
<span id="an_4399"></span> This joly prentys with his maister bood,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4400">4400</span></span> Til he were
ny out of his prentishood,  
<span id="an_4401"></span> Al were he snybbed bothe erly and late,  
<span id="an_4402"></span> And somtyme lad with revel to Newegate.  
<span id="an_4403"></span> But atte laste his maister hym bithoghte,  
<span id="an_4404"></span> Upon a day, whan he his papir soghte,  
<span id="an_4405"></span> Of a proverbe that seith this same word:  
<span id="an_4406"></span> "Wel bet is roten appul out of hoord  
<span id="an_4407"></span> Than that it rotie al the remenaunt."  
<span id="an_4408"></span> So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;  
<span id="an_4409"></span> It is ful lasse harm to lete hym pace,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4410">4410</span></span> Than he
shende alle the servantz in the place.  
<span id="an_4411"></span> Therfore his maister yaf hym acquitance,  
<span id="an_4412"></span> And bad hym go, with sorwe and with
meschance!  
<span id="an_4413"></span> And thus this joly prentys hadde his leve.  
<span id="an_4414"></span> Now lat hym riote al the nyght or leve.  
<span id="an_4415"></span> And for ther is no theef withoute a lowke,  
<span id="an_4416"></span> That helpeth hym to wasten and to sowke  
<span id="an_4417"></span> Of that he brybe kan or borwe may,  
<span id="an_4418"></span> Anon he sente his bed and his array  
<span id="an_4419"></span> Unto a compeer of his owene sort,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_4420">4420</span></span> That lovede
dys, and revel, and disport,  
<span id="an_4421"></span> And hadde a wyf that heeld for contenance  
<span id="an_4422"></span> A shoppe, and swyved for hir sustenance.
