#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Tale of Melibee

<span id="an_967"></span> A yong man called Melibeus, myghty and riche,
bigat upon his wyf, that called was Prudence,  
<span id="an_967A"></span> a doghter which that called was Sophie.  
<span id="an_968"></span> Upon a day bifel that he for his desport is
went into the feeldes hym to pleye.  
<span id="an_969"></span> His wyf and eek his doghter hath he left
inwith his hous, of which the dores weren faste yshette.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970">970</span></span> Thre of his
olde foes han it espyed, and setten laddres to the walles of his hous,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970A">970A</span></span> and by
wyndowes been entred,  
<span id="an_971"></span> and betten his wyf, and wounded his doghter
with fyve mortal woundes in fyve sondry places --  
<span id="an_972"></span> this is to seyn, in hir feet, in hire handes,
in hir erys, in hir nose,  
<span id="an_972A"></span> and in hire mouth -- and leften hire for
deed, and wenten awey.  
<span id="an_973"></span> Whan Melibeus retourned was into his hous, and
saugh al this meschief, he,  
<span id="an_973A"></span> lyk a mad man rentynge his clothes, gan to
wepe and crie.  
<span id="an_974"></span> Prudence, his wyf, as ferforth as she dorste,
bisoghte hym of his wepyng for to stynte,  
<span id="an_975"></span> but nat forthy he gan to crie and wepen evere
lenger the moore.  
<span id="an_976"></span> This noble wyf Prudence remembred hire upon
the sentence of Ovide, in his book  
<span id="an_976A"></span> that cleped is the Remedie of Love, where as
he seith,  
<span id="an_977"></span> "He is a fool that destourbeth the mooder to
wepen in the deeth of hire child  
<span id="an_977A"></span> til she have wept hir fille as for a certein
tyme,  
<span id="an_978"></span> and thanne shal man doon his diligence with
amyable wordes hire to reconforte,  
<span id="an_978A"></span> and preyen hire of hir wepyng for to
stynte."  
<span id="an_979"></span> For which resoun this noble wyf Prudence
suffred hir housbonde  
<span id="an_979A"></span> for to wepe and crie as for a certein
space,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980">980</span></span> and whan she
saugh hir tyme, she seyde hym in this wise:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980A">980A</span></span> "Allas, my
lord," quod she, "why make ye youreself for to be lyk a fool?  
<span id="an_981"></span> For sothe it aperteneth nat to a wys man to
maken swich a sorwe.  
<span id="an_982"></span> Youre doghter, with the grace of God, shal
warisshe and escape.  
<span id="an_983"></span> And, al were it so that she right now were
deed,  
<span id="an_983A"></span> ye ne oughte nat, as for hir deeth, youreself
to destroye.  
<span id="an_984"></span> Senek seith: \`The wise man shal nat take to
greet disconfort for the deeth of his children,  
<span id="an_985"></span> but, certes, he sholde suffren it in
pacience  
<span id="an_985A"></span> as wel as he abideth the deeth of his owene
propre persone.'"  
<span id="an_986"></span> This Melibeus answerde anon and seyde, "What
man," quod he, "sholde of his wepyng stente  
<span id="an_986A"></span> that hath so greet a cause for to wepe?  
<span id="an_987"></span> Jhesu Crist, oure Lord, hymself wepte for the
deeth of Lazarus hys freend."  
<span id="an_988"></span> Prudence answerde: "Certes, wel I woot
attempree wepyng is no thyng deffended to hym that sorweful is,  
<span id="an_988A"></span> amonges folk in sorwe, but it is rather
graunted hym to wepe.  
<span id="an_989"></span> The Apostle Paul unto the Romayns writeth,
\`Man shal rejoyse  
<span id="an_989A"></span> with hem that maken joye and wepen with swich
folk as wepen.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_990">990</span></span> But though
attempree wepyng be ygraunted, outrageous wepyng certes is deffended.  
<span id="an_991"></span> Mesure of wepyng sholde be considered after
the loore that techeth us Senek:  
<span id="an_992"></span> \`Whan that thy frend is deed,' quod he, \`lat
nat thyne eyen to moyste been of teeris,  
<span id="an_992A"></span> ne to muche drye; although the teeris come to
thyne eyen, lat hem nat falle;  
<span id="an_993"></span> and whan thou hast forgoon thy freend, do
diligence to gete another freend;  
<span id="an_993A"></span> and this is moore wysdom than for to wepe for
thy freend  
<span id="an_993B"></span> which that thou hast lorn, for therinne is no
boote.'  
<span id="an_994"></span> And therfore, if ye governe yow by sapience,
put awey sorwe out of youre herte.  
<span id="an_995"></span> Remembre yow that Jhesus Syrak seith, \`A man
that is joyous and glad in herte,  
<span id="an_995A"></span> it hym conserveth florissynge in his age; but
soothly sorweful herte maketh his bones drye.'  
<span id="an_996"></span> He seith eek thus, that sorwe in herte sleeth
ful many a man.  
<span id="an_997"></span> Salomon seith that right as motthes in the
shepes flees anoyeth to the clothes,  
<span id="an_997A"></span> and the smale wormes to the tree, right so
anoyeth sorwe to the herte.  
<span id="an_998"></span> Wherfore us oghte, as wel in the deeth of oure
children  
<span id="an_998A"></span> as in the los of oure othere goodes
temporels, have pacience.  
<span id="an_999"></span> Remembre yow upon the pacient Job. Whan he
hadde lost his children and his temporeel substance,  
<span id="an_999A"></span> and in his body endured and receyved ful many
a grevous tribulacion, yet seyde he thus:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000">1000</span></span> \`Oure Lord
hath yeve it me; oure Lord hath biraft it me; right as oure Lord hath
wold,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000A">1000A</span></span> right so
it is doon; blessed be the name of oure Lord!'"  
<span id="an_1001"></span> To thise forseide thynges answerde Melibeus
unto his wyf Prudence: "Alle thy wordes," quod he,  
<span id="an_1001A"></span> "been sothe and therto profitable, but
trewely myn herte is troubled with this sorwe  
<span id="an_1001B"></span> so grevously that I noot what to doone."  
<span id="an_1002"></span> "Lat calle," quod Prudence, "thy trewe
freendes alle and thy lynage whiche that been wise. Telleth youre cas,  
<span id="an_1002A"></span> and herkneth what they seye in conseillyng,
and yow governe after hire sentence.  
<span id="an_1003"></span> Salomon seith, \`Werk alle thy thynges by
conseil, and thou shalt never repente.'"  
<span id="an_1004"></span> Thanne, by the conseil of his wyf Prudence,
this Melibeus leet callen a greet congregacion of folk,  
<span id="an_1005"></span> as surgiens, phisiciens, olde folk and yonge,
and somme of his olde enemys reconsiled  
<span id="an_1005A"></span> as by hir semblaunt to his love and into his
grace;  
<span id="an_1006"></span> and therwithal ther coomen somme of his
neighebores that diden hym reverence  
<span id="an_1006A"></span> moore for drede than for love, as it happeth
ofte.  
<span id="an_1007"></span> Ther coomen also ful many subtille flatereres
and wise advocatz lerned in the lawe.  
<span id="an_1008"></span> And whan this folk togidre assembled weren,
this Melibeus in sorweful wise shewed hem his cas.  
<span id="an_1009"></span> And by the manere of his speche it semed that
in herte he baar a crueel ire,  
<span id="an_1009A"></span> redy to doon vengeaunce upon his foes, and
sodeynly desired that the werre sholde bigynne;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1010">1010</span></span> but
nathelees, yet axed he hire conseil upon this matiere.  
<span id="an_1011"></span> A surgien, by licence and assent of swiche as
weren wise, up roos  
<span id="an_1011A"></span> and to Melibeus seyde as ye may heere:  
<span id="an_1012"></span> "Sire," quod he, "as to us surgiens
aperteneth that we do to every wight the beste that we kan,  
<span id="an_1012A"></span> where as we been withholde, and to oure
pacientz that we do no damage,  
<span id="an_1013"></span> wherfore it happeth many tyme and ofte that
whan twey men han everich wounded oother,  
<span id="an_1013A"></span> oon same surgien heeleth hem bothe;  
<span id="an_1014"></span> wherfore unto oure art it is nat pertinent to
norice werre ne parties to supporte.  
<span id="an_1015"></span> But certes, as to the warisshynge of youre
doghter, al be it so that she perilously be wounded,  
<span id="an_1015A"></span> we shullen do so ententif bisynesse fro day
to nyght that with the grace of God  
<span id="an_1015B"></span> she shal be hool and sound as soone as is
possible."  
<span id="an_1016"></span> Almoost right in the same wise the phisiciens
answerden, save that they seyden a fewe woordes moore:  
<span id="an_1017"></span> that right as maladies been cured by hir
contraries, right so shul men warisshe werre by vengeaunce.  
<span id="an_1018"></span> His neighebores ful of envye, his feyned
freendes that semeden reconsiled, and his flatereres  
<span id="an_1019"></span> maden semblant of wepyng, and empeireden and
agreggeden muchel of this matiere  
<span id="an_1019A"></span> in preisynge greetly Melibee of myght, of
power, of richesse, and of freendes, despisynge the power of his
adversaries,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1020">1020</span></span> and seiden
outrely that he anon sholde wreken hym on his foes and bigynne werre.  
<span id="an_1021"></span> Up roos thanne an advocat that was wys,  
<span id="an_1021A"></span> by leve and by conseil of othere that were
wise, and seide:  
<span id="an_1022"></span> "Lordynges, the nede for which we been
assembled in this place  
<span id="an_1022A"></span> is a ful hevy thyng and an heigh matiere,  
<span id="an_1023"></span> by cause of the wrong and of the wikkednesse
that hath be doon,  
<span id="an_1023A"></span> and eek by resoun of the grete damages that
in tyme comynge  
<span id="an_1023B"></span> been possible to fallen for this same
cause,  
<span id="an_1024"></span> and eek by resoun of the grete richesse and
power of the parties bothe,  
<span id="an_1025"></span> for the whiche resouns it were a ful greet
peril to erren in this matiere.  
<span id="an_1026"></span> Wherfore, Melibeus, this is oure sentence: we
conseille yow aboven alle thyng that right anon thou do thy diligence  
<span id="an_1026A"></span> in kepynge of thy propre persone in swich a
wise  
<span id="an_1026B"></span> that thou ne wante noon espie ne wacche thy
persone for to save.  
<span id="an_1027"></span> And after that, we conseille that in thyn
hous thou sette sufficeant garnisoun  
<span id="an_1027A"></span> so that they may as wel thy body as thyn
hous defende.  
<span id="an_1028"></span> But certes, for to moeve werre, ne sodeynly
for to doon vengeaunce, we may nat demen  
<span id="an_1028A"></span> in so litel tyme that it were profitable.  
<span id="an_1029"></span> Wherfore we axen leyser and espace to have
deliberacion in this cas to deme.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1030">1030</span></span> For the
commune proverbe seith thus: \`He that soone deemeth, soone shal
repente.'  
<span id="an_1031"></span> And eek men seyn that thilke juge is wys that
soone understondeth a matiere and juggeth by leyser;  
<span id="an_1032"></span> for al be it so that alle tariyng be
anoyful,  
<span id="an_1032A"></span> algates it is nat to repreve in yevynge of
juggement ne in vengeance takyng,  
<span id="an_1032B"></span> whan it is sufficeant and resonable.  
<span id="an_1033"></span> And that shewed oure Lord Jhesu Crist by
ensample, for whan that the womman that was taken in avowtrie  
<span id="an_1033A"></span> was broght in his presence to knowen what
sholde be doon with hire persone, al be it so that he wiste wel hymself
what  
<span id="an_1033B"></span> that he wolde answere, yet ne wolde he nat
answere sodeynly,  
<span id="an_1033C"></span> but he wolde have deliberacion, and in the
ground he wroot twies.  
<span id="an_1034"></span> And by thise causes we axen deliberacioun,
and we shal thanne, by the grace of God, conseille thee  
<span id="an_1034A"></span> thyng that shal be profitable."  
<span id="an_1035"></span> Up stirten thanne the yonge folk atones, and
the mooste partie of that compaignye han scorned this olde wise  
<span id="an_1035A"></span> man, and bigonnen to make noyse, and seyden
that  
<span id="an_1036"></span> right so as whil that iren is hoot men
sholden smyte,  
<span id="an_1036A"></span> right so men sholde wreken hir wronges whil
that they been fresshe and newe;  
<span id="an_1036B"></span> and with loud voys they criden "Werre!
Werre!"  
<span id="an_1037"></span> Up roos tho oon of thise olde wise, and with
his hand made contenaunce that  
<span id="an_1037A"></span> men sholde holden hem stille and yeven hym
audience.  
<span id="an_1038"></span> "Lordynges," quod he, "ther is ful many a man
that crieth \`Werre, werre!'  
<span id="an_1038A"></span> that woot ful litel what werre amounteth.  
<span id="an_1039"></span> Werre at his bigynnyng hath so greet an
entryng and so large that every wight may entre  
<span id="an_1039A"></span> whan hym liketh and lightly fynde werre;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1040">1040</span></span> but certes
what ende that shal therof bifalle, it is nat light to knowe.  
<span id="an_1041"></span> For soothly, whan that werre is ones bigonne,
ther is ful many a child unborn of his mooder  
<span id="an_1041A"></span> that shal sterve yong by cause of thilke
werre, or elles lyve in sorwe and dye in wrecchednesse.  
<span id="an_1042"></span> And therfore, er that any werre bigynne, men
moste have greet conseil and greet deliberacion."  
<span id="an_1043"></span> And whan this olde man wende to enforcen his
tale by resons, wel ny alle atones bigonne they  
<span id="an_1043A"></span> to rise for to breken his tale, and beden
hym ful ofte his wordes for to abregge.  
<span id="an_1044"></span> For soothly, he that precheth to hem that
listen nat heeren his wordes, his sermon hem anoieth.  
<span id="an_1045"></span> For Jhesus Syrak seith that "musik in wepynge
is a noyous thyng"; this is to seyn:  
<span id="an_1045A"></span> as muche availleth to speken bifore folk to
which his speche anoyeth  
<span id="an_1045B"></span> as it is to synge biforn hym that wepeth.  
<span id="an_1046"></span> And whan this wise man saugh that hym wanted
audience, al shamefast he sette hym doun agayn.  
<span id="an_1047"></span> For Salomon seith: "Ther as thou ne mayst
have noon audience, enforce thee nat to speke."  
<span id="an_1048"></span> "I see wel," quod this wise man, "that the
commune proverbe is sooth, that  
<span id="an_1048A"></span> \`good conseil wanteth whan it is moost
nede.'"  
<span id="an_1049"></span> Yet hadde this Melibeus in his conseil many
folk that prively in his eere conseilled hym certeyn thyng,  
<span id="an_1049A"></span> and conseilled hym the contrarie in general
audience.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1050">1050</span></span> Whan
Melibeus hadde herd that the gretteste partie of his conseil weren
accorded that he sholde maken werre,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1050A">1050A</span></span> anoon he
consented to hir conseillyng and fully affermed hire sentence.  
<span id="an_1051"></span> Thanne dame Prudence, whan that she saugh how
that hir housbonde shoop hym for to wreken hym on his  
<span id="an_1051A"></span> foes and to bigynne werre, she in ful humble
wise, whan she saugh hir tyme, seide to hym thise wordes:  
<span id="an_1052"></span> "My lord," quod she, "I yow biseche, as
hertely as I dar and kan,  
<span id="an_1052A"></span> ne haste yow nat to faste and, for alle
gerdons, as yeveth me audience.  
<span id="an_1053"></span> For Piers Alfonce seith, \`Whoso that dooth
to thee oother good or harm, haste thee nat to quiten it,  
<span id="an_1053A"></span> for in this wise thy freend wole abyde and
thyn enemy shal the lenger lyve in drede.'  
<span id="an_1054"></span> The proverbe seith, \`He hasteth wel that
wisely kan abyde,' and \`in wikked haste is no profit.'"  
<span id="an_1055"></span> This Melibee answerde unto his wyf Prudence:
"I purpose nat," quod he, "to werke by thy conseil,  
<span id="an_1055A"></span> for many causes and resouns. For certes,
every wight wolde holde me thanne a fool;  
<span id="an_1056"></span> this is to seyn, if I, for thy conseillyng,
wolde chaungen  
<span id="an_1056A"></span> thynges that been ordeyned and affermed by
so manye wyse.  
<span id="an_1057"></span> Secoundely, I seye that alle wommen been
wikke, and noon good of hem alle.  
<span id="an_1057A"></span> For \`of a thousand men,' seith Salomon, \`I
foond o good man, but certes,  
<span id="an_1057B"></span> of alle wommen, good womman foond I
nevere.'  
<span id="an_1058"></span> And also, certes, if I governed me by thy
conseil,  
<span id="an_1058A"></span> it sholde seme that I hadde yeve to thee
over me the maistrie,  
<span id="an_1058B"></span> and God forbede that it so weere!  
<span id="an_1059"></span> For Jhesus Syrak seith that \`if the wyf have
maistrie, she is contrarious to hir housbonde.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060">1060</span></span> And Salomon
seith: \`Nevere in thy lyf to thy wyf, ne to thy child, ne to thy
freend  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060A">1060A</span></span> ne yeve
no power over thyself, for bettre it were that thy children  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060B">1060B</span></span> aske of
thy persone thynges that hem nedeth than thou see thyself  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060C">1060C</span></span> in the
handes of thy children.'  
<span id="an_1061"></span> And also if I wolde werke by thy conseillyng,
certes, my conseil moste som tyme be secree,  
<span id="an_1061A"></span> til it were tyme that it moste be knowe, and
this ne may noght be.  
<span id="an_1064"></span> Whanne dame Prudence, ful debonairly and with
greet pacience, hadde herd al that hir housbonde liked for to seye,  
<span id="an_1064A"></span> thanne axed she of hym licence for to speke,
and seyde in this wise:  
<span id="an_1065"></span> "My lord," quod she, "as to youre firste
resoun, certes it may lightly been answered. For I seye that  
<span id="an_1065A"></span> it is no folie to chaunge conseil whan the
thyng is chaunged,  
<span id="an_1065B"></span> or elles whan the thyng semeth ootherweyes
than it was biforn.  
<span id="an_1066"></span> And mooreover, I seye that though ye han
sworn and bihight to perfourne youre emprise, and nathelees ye weyve  
<span id="an_1066A"></span> to perfourne thilke same emprise by juste
cause, men sholde nat seyn therfore that ye were a liere ne forsworn.  
<span id="an_1067"></span> For the book seith that \`the wise man maketh
no lesyng whan he turneth his corage to the bettre.'  
<span id="an_1068"></span> And al be it so that youre emprise be
establissed and ordeyned by greet multitude of folk,  
<span id="an_1068A"></span> yet thar ye nat accomplice thilke ordinaunce
but yow like.  
<span id="an_1069"></span> For the trouthe of thynges and the profit
been rather founden in fewe folk that been wise and  
<span id="an_1069A"></span> ful of resoun than by greet multitude of
folk ther every man crieth and clatereth what that hym liketh.  
<span id="an_1069B"></span> Soothly swich multitude is nat honest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070">1070</span></span> And as to
the seconde resoun, where as ye seyn that alle wommen been wikke;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070A">1070A</span></span> save
youre grace, certes ye despisen alle wommen in this wyse, and  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070B">1070B</span></span> \`he that
al despiseth, al displeseth,' as seith the book.  
<span id="an_1071"></span> And Senec seith that \`whoso wole have
sapience shal no man dispreyse,  
<span id="an_1071A"></span> but he shal gladly techen the science that
he kan withouten presumpcion or pride;  
<span id="an_1072"></span> and swiche thynges as he noght ne kan, he
shal nat been ashamed to lerne hem,  
<span id="an_1072A"></span> and enquere of lasse folk than hymself.'  
<span id="an_1073"></span> And, sire, that ther hath been many a good
womman may lightly be preved.  
<span id="an_1074"></span> For certes, sire, oure Lord Jhesu Crist wolde
nevere have descended to be born of a womman,  
<span id="an_1074A"></span> if alle wommen hadden been wikke.  
<span id="an_1075"></span> And after that, for the grete bountee that is
in wommen,  
<span id="an_1075A"></span> oure Lord Jhesu Crist, whan he was risen fro
deeth to lyve,  
<span id="an_1075B"></span> appeered rather to a womman than to his
Apostles.  
<span id="an_1076"></span> And though that Salomon seith that he ne
foond nevere womman good,  
<span id="an_1076A"></span> it folweth nat therfore that alle wommen ben
wikke.  
<span id="an_1077"></span> For though that he ne foond no good womman,
certes,  
<span id="an_1077A"></span> many another man hath founden many a womman
ful good and trewe.  
<span id="an_1078"></span> Or elles, per aventure, the entente of
Salomon was this:  
<span id="an_1078A"></span> that, as in sovereyn bounte, he foond no
womman --  
<span id="an_1079"></span> this is to seyn, that ther is no wight that
hath sovereyn bountee save God allone,  
<span id="an_1079A"></span> as he hymself recordeth in hys Evaungelie.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080">1080</span></span> For ther
nys no creature so good that hym ne wanteth  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080A">1080A</span></span> somwhat
of the perfeccioun of God, that is his makere.  
<span id="an_1081"></span> Youre thridde reson is this: ye seyn that if
ye governe yow by my conseil,  
<span id="an_1081A"></span> it sholde seme that ye hadde yeve me the
maistrie and the lordshipe over youre persone.  
<span id="an_1082"></span> Sire, save youre grace, it is nat so. For if
it so were that no man sholde be conseilled  
<span id="an_1082A"></span> but oonly of hem that hadden lordshipe and
maistrie of his persone, men wolden nat be conseilled so ofte.  
<span id="an_1083"></span> For soothly thilke man that asketh conseil of
a purpos, yet hath he free choys  
<span id="an_1083A"></span> wheither he wole werke by that conseil or
noon.  
<span id="an_1084"></span> And as to youre fourthe resoun, ther ye seyn
that the janglerie of wommen kan hyde thynges that they  
<span id="an_1084A"></span> wot noght, as who seith that a womman kan
nat hyde that she woot;  
<span id="an_1085"></span> sire, thise wordes been understonde of wommen
that been jangleresses and wikked;  
<span id="an_1086"></span> of whiche wommen men seyn that thre thynges
dryven a man out of his hous --  
<span id="an_1086A"></span> that is to seyn, smoke, droppyng of reyn,
and wikked wyves;  
<span id="an_1087"></span> and of swiche wommen seith Salomon that  
<span id="an_1087A"></span> \`it were bettre dwelle in desert than with
a womman that is riotous.'  
<span id="an_1088"></span> And sire, by youre leve, that am nat I,  
<span id="an_1089"></span> for ye han ful ofte assayed my grete silence
and my grete pacience, and eek how wel that  
<span id="an_1089A"></span> I kan hyde and hele thynges that men oghte
secreely to hyde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090">1090</span></span> And
soothly, as to youre fifthe resoun, where as ye seyn that in wikked
conseil wommen venquisshe men,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090A">1090A</span></span> God woot,
thilke resoun stant heere in no stede.  
<span id="an_1091"></span> For understoond now, ye asken conseil to do
wikkednesse;  
<span id="an_1092"></span> and if ye wole werken wikkednesse, and youre
wif restreyneth thilke wikked purpos,  
<span id="an_1092A"></span> and overcometh yow by reson and by good
conseil,  
<span id="an_1093"></span> certes youre wyf oghte rather to be preised
than yblamed.  
<span id="an_1094"></span> Thus sholde ye understonde the philosophre
that seith, \`In wikked conseil wommen venquisshen hir housbondes.'  
<span id="an_1095"></span> And ther as ye blamen alle wommen and hir
resouns, I shal shewe yow by manye ensamples that  
<span id="an_1095A"></span> many a womman hath ben ful good, and yet
been, and hir conseils ful hoolsome and profitable.  
<span id="an_1096"></span> Eek som men han seyd that the conseillynge of
wommen  
<span id="an_1096A"></span> is outher to deere or elles to litel of
pris.  
<span id="an_1097"></span> But al be it so that ful many a womman is
badde and hir conseil vile and noght worth,  
<span id="an_1097A"></span> yet han men founde ful many a good womman,
and ful discret and wis in conseillynge.  
<span id="an_1098"></span> Loo, Jacob by good conseil of his mooder
Rebekka wan the benysoun of Ysaak his fader  
<span id="an_1098A"></span> and the lordshipe over alle his bretheren.  
<span id="an_1099"></span> Judith by hire good conseil delivered the
citee of Bethulie, in which she dwelled,  
<span id="an_1099A"></span> out of the handes of Olofernus, that hadde
it biseged and wolde have al destroyed it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100">1100</span></span> Abygail
delivered Nabal hir housbonde fro David the kyng, that wolde have slayn
hym,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100A">1100A</span></span> and
apaysed the ire of the kyng by hir wit and by hir good conseillyng.  
<span id="an_1101"></span> Hester by hir good conseil enhaunced greetly
the peple of God in the regne of Assuerus the kyng.  
<span id="an_1102"></span> And the same bountee in good conseillyng of
many a good womman may men telle.  
<span id="an_1103"></span> And mooreover, whan oure Lord hadde creat
Adam, oure forme fader, he seyde in this wise:  
<span id="an_1104"></span> \`It is nat good to been a man alloone; make
we to hym an helpe semblable to hymself.'  
<span id="an_1105"></span> Heere may ye se that if that wommen were nat
goode, and hir conseils goode and profitable,  
<span id="an_1106"></span> oure Lord God of hevene wolde nevere han
wroght hem,  
<span id="an_1106A"></span> ne called hem help of man, but rather
confusioun of man.  
<span id="an_1107"></span> And ther seyde oones a clerk in two vers,
\`What is bettre than gold? Jaspre.  
<span id="an_1107A"></span> What is bettre than jaspre? Wisedoom.  
<span id="an_1108"></span> And what is better than wisedoom? Womman. And
what is bettre than a good womman? Nothyng.'  
<span id="an_1109"></span> And, sire, by manye of othre resons may ye
seen that  
<span id="an_1109A"></span> manye wommen been goode, and hir conseils
goode and profitable.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1110">1110</span></span> And
therfore, sire, if ye wol triste to my conseil, I shal restoore yow
youre doghter hool and sound.  
<span id="an_1111"></span> And eek I wol do to yow so muche that ye shul
have honour in this cause."  
<span id="an_1112"></span> Whan Melibee hadde herd the wordes of his wyf
Prudence, he seyde thus:  
<span id="an_1113"></span> "I se wel that the word of Salomon is
sooth.  
<span id="an_1113A"></span> He seith that \`wordes that been spoken
discreetly by ordinaunce been honycombes,  
<span id="an_1113B"></span> for they yeven swetnesse to the soule and
hoolsomnesse to the body.'  
<span id="an_1114"></span> And, wyf, by cause of thy sweete wordes, and
eek for I have assayed and preved thy grete sapience  
<span id="an_1114A"></span> and thy grete trouthe, I wol governe me by
thy conseil in alle thyng."  
<span id="an_1115"></span> "Now, sire," quod dame Prudence, "and syn ye
vouche sauf to been governed by my conseil,  
<span id="an_1115A"></span> I wol enforme yow how ye shul governe
yourself in chesynge of youre conseillours.  
<span id="an_1116"></span> Ye shul first in alle youre werkes mekely
biseken to the heighe God that he wol be youre conseillour;  
<span id="an_1117"></span> and shapeth yow to swich entente that he yeve
yow conseil and confort, as taughte Thobie his sone:  
<span id="an_1118"></span> \`At alle tymes thou shalt blesse God, and
praye hym to dresse thy weyes,  
<span id="an_1118A"></span> and looke that alle thy conseils been in hym
for everemoore.'  
<span id="an_1119"></span> Seint Jame eek seith: \`If any of yow have
nede of sapience, axe it of God.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1120">1120</span></span> And
afterward thanne shul ye taken conseil in youreself,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1120A">1120A</span></span> and
examyne wel youre thoghtes of swich thyng as yow thynketh that is best
for youre profit.  
<span id="an_1121"></span> And thanne shul ye dryve fro youre herte thre
thynges that been contrariouse to good conseil;  
<span id="an_1122"></span> that is to seyn, ire, coveitise, and
hastifnesse.  
<span id="an_1123"></span> "First, he that axeth conseil of hymself,
certes he moste been withouten ire, for manye causes.  
<span id="an_1124"></span> The firste is this: he that hath greet ire
and wratthe in hymself, he weneth alwey that  
<span id="an_1124A"></span> he may do thyng that he may nat do.  
<span id="an_1125"></span> And secoundely, he that is irous and wrooth,
he ne may nat wel deme;  
<span id="an_1126"></span> and he that may nat wel deme, may nat wel
conseille.  
<span id="an_1127"></span> The thridde is this, that he that is irous
and wrooth, as seith Senec,  
<span id="an_1127A"></span> ne may nat speke but blameful thynges,  
<span id="an_1128"></span> and with his viciouse wordes he stireth
oother folk to angre and to ire.  
<span id="an_1129"></span> And eek, sire, ye moste dryve coveitise out
of youre herte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1130">1130</span></span> For the
Apostle seith that coveitise is roote of alle harmes.  
<span id="an_1131"></span> And trust wel that a coveitous man ne kan
noght deme ne thynke,  
<span id="an_1131A"></span> but oonly to fulfille the ende of his
coveitise;  
<span id="an_1132"></span> and certes, that ne may nevere been
accompliced,  
<span id="an_1132A"></span> for evere the moore habundaunce that he hath
of richesse, the moore he desireth.  
<span id="an_1133"></span> And, sire, ye moste also dryve out of youre
herte hastifnesse; for certes,  
<span id="an_1134"></span> ye ne may nat deeme for the beste by a sodeyn
thought that falleth in youre herte,  
<span id="an_1134A"></span> but ye moste avyse yow on it ful ofte.  
<span id="an_1135"></span> For, as ye herde her biforn, the commune
proverbe is this, that \`he that soone deemeth, soone repenteth.'  
<span id="an_1136"></span> Sire, ye ne be nat alwey in lyk
disposicioun;  
<span id="an_1137"></span> for certes, somthyng that somtyme semeth to
yow that it is good for to do,  
<span id="an_1137A"></span> another tyme it semeth to yow the
contrarie.  
<span id="an_1138"></span> "Whan ye han taken conseil in youreself and
han deemed by good deliberacion swich thyng as you semeth best,  
<span id="an_1139"></span> thanne rede I yow that ye kepe it secree.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1140">1140</span></span> Biwrey nat
youre conseil to no persone, but if so be that ye wenen sikerly that  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1140A">1140A</span></span> thurgh
youre biwreyyng youre condicioun shal be to yow the moore profitable.  
<span id="an_1141"></span> For Jhesus Syrak seith, \`Neither to thy foo
ne to thy frend discovere nat thy secree ne thy folie,  
<span id="an_1142"></span> for they wol yeve yow audience and lookynge
and supportacioun in thy presence and scorne thee in thyn absence.'  
<span id="an_1143"></span> Another clerk seith that \`scarsly shaltou
fynden any persone that may kepe conseil secrely.'  
<span id="an_1144"></span> The book seith, \`Whil that thou kepest thy
conseil in thyn herte, thou kepest it in thy prisoun,  
<span id="an_1145"></span> and whan thou biwreyest thy conseil to any
wight, he holdeth thee in his snare.'  
<span id="an_1146"></span> And therfore yow is bettre to hyde youre
conseil in youre herte than praye him  
<span id="an_1146A"></span> to whom ye han biwreyed youre conseil that
he wole kepen it cloos and stille.  
<span id="an_1147"></span> For Seneca seith: \`If so be that thou ne
mayst nat thyn owene conseil hyde,  
<span id="an_1147A"></span> how darstou prayen any oother wight thy
conseil secrely to kepe?'  
<span id="an_1148"></span> But nathelees, if thou wene sikerly that the
biwreiyng of thy conseil to a persone wol make  
<span id="an_1148A"></span> thy condicion to stonden in the bettre plyt,
thanne shaltou tellen hym thy conseil in this wise.  
<span id="an_1149"></span> First thou shalt make no semblant wheither
thee were levere pees or werre, or this or that,  
<span id="an_1149A"></span> ne shewe hym nat thy wille and thyn
entente.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1150">1150</span></span> For trust
wel that comunli thise conseillours been flatereres,  
<span id="an_1151"></span> namely the conseillours of grete lordes,  
<span id="an_1152"></span> for they enforcen hem alwey rather to speken
plesante wordes, enclynynge to the lordes lust,  
<span id="an_1152A"></span> than wordes that been trewe or profitable.  
<span id="an_1153"></span> And therfore men seyn that the riche man hath
seeld good conseil, but if he have it of hymself.  
<span id="an_1154"></span> And after that thou shalt considere thy
freendes and thyne enemys.  
<span id="an_1155"></span> And as touchynge thy freendes, thou shalt
considere which of hem been  
<span id="an_1155A"></span> moost feithful and moost wise and eldest and
most approved in conseillyng;  
<span id="an_1156"></span> and of hem shalt thou aske thy conseil, as
the caas requireth.  
<span id="an_1157"></span> I seye that first ye shul clepe to youre
conseil youre freendes that been trewe.  
<span id="an_1158"></span> For Salomon seith that \`right as the herte
of a man deliteth in savour that is soote,  
<span id="an_1158A"></span> right so the conseil of trewe freendes
yeveth swetnesse to the soule.'  
<span id="an_1159"></span> He seith also, \`Ther may no thyng be likned
to the trewe freend,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1160">1160</span></span> for certes
gold ne silver ben nat so muche worth as the goode wyl of a trewe
freend.'  
<span id="an_1161"></span> And eek he seith that \`a trewe freend is a
strong deffense; who so that it fyndeth,  
<span id="an_1161A"></span> certes he fyndeth a greet tresour.'  
<span id="an_1162"></span> Thanne shul ye eek considere if that youre
trewe freendes been discrete and wise.  
<span id="an_1162A"></span> For the book seith, \`Axe alwey thy conseil
of hem that been wise.'  
<span id="an_1163"></span> And by this same resoun shul ye clepen to
youre conseil of youre freendes that been of age,  
<span id="an_1163A"></span> swiche as han seyn and been expert in manye
thynges and been approved in conseillynges.  
<span id="an_1164"></span> For the book seith that \`in olde men is the
sapience, and in longe tyme the prudence.'  
<span id="an_1165"></span> And Tullius seith that \`grete thynges ne
been nat ay accompliced by strengthe, ne by delivernesse of body, but  
<span id="an_1165A"></span> by good conseil, by auctoritee of persones,
and by science; the whiche thre thynges ne been nat fieble by age,  
<span id="an_1165B"></span> but certes they enforcen and encreescen day
by day.'  
<span id="an_1166"></span> And thanne shul ye kepe this for a general
reule: First shul ye clepen to youre conseil  
<span id="an_1166A"></span> a fewe of youre freendes that been
especiale;  
<span id="an_1167"></span> for Salomon seith, \`Manye freendes have
thou, but among a thousand chese thee oon to be thy conseillour.'  
<span id="an_1168"></span> For al be it so that thou first ne telle thy
conseil but to a fewe,  
<span id="an_1168A"></span> thou mayst afterward telle it to mo folk if
it be nede.  
<span id="an_1169"></span> But looke alwey that thy conseillours have
thilke thre condiciouns that I have seyd bifore --  
<span id="an_1169A"></span> that is to seyn, that they be trewe, wise,
and of oold experience.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1170">1170</span></span> And werke
nat alwey in every nede by oon counseillour allone;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1170A">1170A</span></span> for
somtyme bihooveth it to been conseilled by manye.  
<span id="an_1171"></span> For Salomon seith, \`Salvacion of thynges is
where as ther been manye conseillours.'  
<span id="an_1172"></span> "Now, sith that I have toold yow of which
folk ye sholde been counseilled, now  
<span id="an_1172A"></span> wol I teche yow which conseil ye oghte to
eschewe.  
<span id="an_1173"></span> First, ye shul eschue the conseillyng of
fooles; for Salomon seith, \`Taak no conseil of a fool,  
<span id="an_1173A"></span> for he ne kan noght conseille but after his
owene lust and his affeccioun.'  
<span id="an_1174"></span> The book seith that \`the propretee of a fool
is this: he troweth lightly harm of every wight,  
<span id="an_1174A"></span> and lightly troweth alle bountee in
hymself.'  
<span id="an_1175"></span> Thou shalt eek eschue the conseillyng of alle
flatereres, swiche as enforcen hem rather to preise youre persone  
<span id="an_1175A"></span> by flaterye than for to telle yow the
soothfastnesse of thynges.  
<span id="an_1176"></span> Wherfore Tullius seith, \`Amonges alle the
pestilences that been in freendshipe the gretteste is flaterie.'  
<span id="an_1176A"></span> And therfore is it moore nede that thou
eschue and drede flatereres than any oother peple.  
<span id="an_1177"></span> The book seith, \`Thou shalt rather drede and
flee fro the sweete wordes of flaterynge preiseres  
<span id="an_1177A"></span> than fro the egre wordes of thy freend that
seith thee thy sothes.'  
<span id="an_1178"></span> Salomon seith that \`the wordes of a
flaterere is a snare to cacche with innocentz.'  
<span id="an_1179"></span> He seith also that \`he that speketh to his
freend wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce  
<span id="an_1179A"></span> setteth a net biforn his feet to cacche
hym.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1180">1180</span></span> And
therfore seith Tullius, \`Enclyne nat thyne eres to flatereres, ne taak
no conseil of the wordes of flaterye.'  
<span id="an_1181"></span> And Caton seith, \`Avyse thee wel, and eschue
the wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce.'  
<span id="an_1182"></span> And eek thou shalt eschue the conseillyng of
thyne olde enemys that been reconsiled.  
<span id="an_1183"></span> The book seith that \`no wight retourneth
saufly into the grace of his olde enemy.'  
<span id="an_1184"></span> And Isope seith, \`Ne trust nat to hem to
whiche thou hast had som tyme werre or enemytee,  
<span id="an_1184A"></span> ne telle hem nat thy conseil.'  
<span id="an_1185"></span> And Seneca telleth the cause why: \`It may
nat be,' seith he, \`that where greet  
<span id="an_1185A"></span> fyr hath longe tyme endured, that ther ne
dwelleth som vapour of warmnesse.'  
<span id="an_1186"></span> And therfore seith Salomon, \`In thyn olde
foo trust nevere.'  
<span id="an_1187"></span> For sikerly, though thyn enemy be reconsiled,
and maketh thee chiere of humylitee,  
<span id="an_1187A"></span> and lowteth to thee with his heed, ne trust
hym nevere.  
<span id="an_1188"></span> For certes he maketh thilke feyned humilitee
moore for his profit than for any love of thy persone,  
<span id="an_1188A"></span> by cause that he deemeth to have victorie
over thy persone by swich feyned contenance,  
<span id="an_1188B"></span> the which victorie he myghte nat have by
strif or werre.  
<span id="an_1189"></span> And Peter Alfonce seith, \`Make no felawshipe
with thyne olde enemys, for if thou do hem bountee,  
<span id="an_1189A"></span> they wol perverten it into wikkednesse.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1190">1190</span></span> And eek
thou most eschue the conseillyng of hem that been thy servantz and beren
thee greet reverence,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1190A">1190A</span></span> for
peraventure they seyn it moore for drede than for love.  
<span id="an_1191"></span> And therfore seith a philosophre in this
wise:  
<span id="an_1191A"></span> \`Ther is no wight parfitly trewe to hym
that he to soore dredeth.'  
<span id="an_1192"></span> And Tullius seith, \`Ther nys no myght so
greet of any emperour that longe may endure,  
<span id="an_1192A"></span> but if he have moore love of the peple than
drede.'  
<span id="an_1193"></span> Thou shalt also eschue the conseiling of folk
that been dronkelewe, for they ne kan no conseil hyde.  
<span id="an_1194"></span> For Salomon seith, \`Ther is no privetee ther
as regneth dronkenesse.'  
<span id="an_1195"></span> Ye shul also han in suspect the conseillyng
of swich folk as

<span id="an_1197"></span> Thou shalt also have in suspect the
conseillyng of wikked folk. For the book seith,  
<span id="an_1197A"></span> \`The conseillyng of wikked folk is alwey
ful of fraude.'  
<span id="an_1198"></span> And David seith, \`Blisful is that man that
hath nat folwed the conseilyng of shrewes.'  
<span id="an_1199"></span> Thou shalt also eschue the conseillyng of
yong folk, for hir conseil is nat rype.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200">1200</span></span> "Now, sire,
sith I have shewed yow of which folk ye shul take youre conseil  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200A">1200A</span></span> and of
which folk ye shul folwe the conseil,  
<span id="an_1201"></span> now wol I teche yow how ye shal examyne youre
conseil, after the doctrine of Tullius.  
<span id="an_1202"></span> In the examynynge thanne of youre conseillour
ye shul considere manye thynges.  
<span id="an_1203"></span> Alderfirst thou shalt considere that in
thilke thyng that thou purposest, and upon what thyng thou wolt have
conseil,  
<span id="an_1203A"></span> that verray trouthe be seyd and conserved;
this is to seyn, telle trewely thy tale.  
<span id="an_1204"></span> For he that seith fals may nat wel be
conseilled in that cas of which he lieth.  
<span id="an_1205"></span> And after this thou shalt considere the
thynges that acorden to that thou purposest  
<span id="an_1205A"></span> for to do by thy conseillours, if resoun
accorde therto,  
<span id="an_1206"></span> and eek if thy myght may atteine therto, and
if the moore part  
<span id="an_1206A"></span> and the bettre part of thy conseillours
acorde therto, or noon.  
<span id="an_1207"></span> Thanne shaltou considere what thyng shal
folwe of that conseillyng,  
<span id="an_1207A"></span> as hate, pees, werre, grace, profit, or
damage, and manye othere thynges.  
<span id="an_1208"></span> And in alle thise thynges thou shalt chese
the beste and weyve alle othere thynges.  
<span id="an_1209"></span> Thanne shaltow considere of what roote is
engendred the matiere of thy conseil  
<span id="an_1209A"></span> and what fruyt it may conceyve and
engendre.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1210">1210</span></span> Thou shalt
eek considere alle thise causes, fro whennes they been sprongen.  
<span id="an_1211"></span> And whan ye han examyned youre conseil, as I
have seyd, and which partie is the bettre  
<span id="an_1211A"></span> and moore profitable, and han approved it by
manye wise folk and olde,  
<span id="an_1212"></span> thanne shaltou considere if thou mayst
parfourne it and maken of it a good ende.  
<span id="an_1213"></span> For certes resoun wol nat that any man sholde
bigynne a thyng  
<span id="an_1213A"></span> but if he myghte parfourne it as hym
oghte;  
<span id="an_1214"></span> ne no wight sholde take upon hym so hevy a
charge that he myghte nat bere it.  
<span id="an_1215"></span> For the proverbe seith, \`He that to muche
embraceth, distreyneth litel.'  
<span id="an_1216"></span> And Catoun seith, \`Assay to do swich thyng
as thou hast power to doon,

<span id="an_1217"></span> And if so be that thou be in doute wheither
thou mayst parfourne a thing or noon,  
<span id="an_1217A"></span> chese rather to suffre than bigynne.  
<span id="an_1218"></span> And Piers Alphonce seith, \`If thou hast
myght to doon a thyng of which thou most repente,  
<span id="an_1218A"></span> it is bettre "nay" than "ye."'  
<span id="an_1219"></span> This is to seyn, that thee is bettre holde
thy tonge stille than for to speke.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1220">1220</span></span> Thanne may
ye understonde by strenger resons that if thou hast power to parfourne a
werk  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1220A">1220A</span></span> of which
thou shalt repente, thanne is it bettre that thou suffre than bigynne.  
<span id="an_1221"></span> Wel seyn they that defenden every wight to
assaye a thyng of which he is in doute  
<span id="an_1221A"></span> wheither he may parfourne it or noon.  
<span id="an_1222"></span> And after, whan ye han examyned youre
conseil, as I have seyd biforn, and knowen wel that  
<span id="an_1222A"></span> ye may parfourne youre emprise, conferme it
thanne sadly til it be at an ende.  
<span id="an_1223"></span> "Now is it resoun and tyme that I shewe yow
whanne and wherfore that  
<span id="an_1223A"></span> ye may chaunge youre counseil withouten
youre repreve.  
<span id="an_1224"></span> Soothly, a man may chaungen his purpos and
his conseil if the cause cesseth,  
<span id="an_1224A"></span> or whan a newe caas bitydeth.  
<span id="an_1225"></span> For the lawe seith that \`upon thynges that
newely bityden bihoveth newe conseil.'  
<span id="an_1226"></span> And Senec seith, \`If thy conseil is comen to
the eeris of thyn enemy, chaunge thy conseil.'  
<span id="an_1227"></span> Thou mayst also chaunge thy conseil if so be
that thou fynde that by errour,  
<span id="an_1227A"></span> or by oother cause, harm or damage may
bityde.  
<span id="an_1228"></span> Also if thy conseil be dishonest, or ellis
cometh of dishonest cause, chaunge thy conseil.  
<span id="an_1229"></span> For the lawes seyn that \`alle bihestes that

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1230">1230</span></span> and eek if
so be that it be inpossible, or may nat goodly be parfourned or kept.  
<span id="an_1231"></span> "And take this for a general reule, that
every conseil that is affermed so strongly that it may nat  
<span id="an_1231A"></span> be chaunged for no condicioun that may
bityde, I seye that thilke conseil is wikked."  
<span id="an_1232"></span> This Melibeus, whanne he hadde herd the
doctrine of his wyf dame Prudence, answerde in this wyse:  
<span id="an_1233"></span> "Dame," quod he, "as yet into this tyme ye
han wel and covenably taught me as in general how  
<span id="an_1233A"></span> I shal governe me in the chesynge and in the
withholdynge of my conseillours.  
<span id="an_1234"></span> But now wolde I fayn that ye wolde
condescende in especial  
<span id="an_1235"></span> and telle me how liketh yow, or what semeth
yow, by oure conseillours  
<span id="an_1235A"></span> that we han chosen in oure present nede."  
<span id="an_1236"></span> "My lord," quod she, "I biseke yow in al

<span id="an_1237"></span> For God woot that, as in myn entente, I speke
it for youre beste,  
<span id="an_1237A"></span> for youre honour, and for youre profite

<span id="an_1238"></span> And soothly, I hope that youre benyngnytee
wol taken it in pacience.  
<span id="an_1239"></span> Trusteth me wel," quod she, "that youre

moevyng of folye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1240">1240</span></span> in which

<span id="an_1241"></span> "First and forward, ye han erred in th'
assemblynge of youre conseillours.  
<span id="an_1242"></span> For ye sholde first have cleped a fewe folk
to youre conseil, and after ye myghte han shewed it  
<span id="an_1242A"></span> to mo folk, if it hadde been nede.  
<span id="an_1243"></span> But certes, ye han sodeynly cleped to youre
conseil a greet multitude of peple,  
<span id="an_1243A"></span> ful chargeant and ful anoyous for to
heere.  
<span id="an_1244"></span> Also ye han erred, for theras ye sholden
oonly have cleped to youre conseil  
<span id="an_1244A"></span> youre trewe frendes olde and wise,  
<span id="an_1245"></span> ye han ycleped straunge folk, yonge folk,
false flatereres, and enemys reconsiled,  
<span id="an_1245A"></span> and folk that doon yow reverence withouten
love.  
<span id="an_1246"></span> And eek also ye have erred, for ye han broght
with yow to youre conseil ire, coveitise, and hastifnesse,  
<span id="an_1247"></span> the whiche thre thinges been contrariouse to
every conseil honest and profitable;  
<span id="an_1248"></span> the whiche thre thinges ye han nat
anientissed or destroyed hem,  
<span id="an_1248A"></span> neither in youreself, ne in youre
conseillours, as yow oghte.  
<span id="an_1249"></span> Ye han erred also, for ye han shewed to youre
conseillours  
<span id="an_1249A"></span> youre talent and youre affeccioun to make
werre anon and for to do vengeance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1250">1250</span></span> They han
espied by youre wordes to what thyng ye been enclyned;  
<span id="an_1251"></span> and therfore han they rather conseilled yow
to youre talent than to youre profit.  
<span id="an_1252"></span> Ye han erred also, for it semeth that yow
suffiseth  
<span id="an_1252A"></span> to han been conseilled by thise conseillours
oonly, and with litel avys,  
<span id="an_1253"></span> whereas in so greet and so heigh a nede it
hadde been necessarie mo conseillours  
<span id="an_1253A"></span> and moore deliberacion to parfourne youre
emprise.  
<span id="an_1254"></span> Ye han erred also, for ye ne han nat examyned
youre conseil in the forseyde manere,  
<span id="an_1254A"></span> ne in due manere, as the caas requireth.  
<span id="an_1255"></span> Ye han erred also, for ye han maked no
division bitwixe youre conseillours -- this is to seyn,  
<span id="an_1255A"></span> bitwixen youre trewe freendes and youre
feyned conseillours --  
<span id="an_1256"></span> ne ye han nat knowe the wil of youre trewe
freendes olde and wise,  
<span id="an_1257"></span> but ye han cast alle hire wordes in an
hochepot, and enclyned youre herte to the moore part  
<span id="an_1257A"></span> and to the gretter nombre, and there been ye
condescended.  
<span id="an_1258"></span> And sith ye woot wel that men shal alwey
fynde a gretter nombre of fooles than of wise men,  
<span id="an_1259"></span> and therfore the conseils that been at
congregaciouns and multitudes of folk, there as men take moore reward  
<span id="an_1259A"></span> to the nombre than to the sapience of
persones,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1260">1260</span></span> ye se wel
that in swiche conseillynges fooles han the maistrie."  
<span id="an_1261"></span> Melibeus answerde agayn, and seyde, "I
graunte wel that I have erred;  
<span id="an_1262"></span> but there as thou hast toold me heerbiforn  
<span id="an_1262A"></span> that he nys nat to blame that chaungeth his
conseillours in certein caas and for certeine juste causes,  
<span id="an_1263"></span> I am al redy to chaunge my conseillours right

<span id="an_1264A"></span> but certes for to persevere longe in synne
is werk of the devel.'"  
<span id="an_1265"></span> To this sentence answered anon dame Prudence,
and seyde,  
<span id="an_1266"></span> "Examineth," quod she, "youre conseil, and
lat us see  
<span id="an_1266A"></span> the whiche of hem han spoken most resonably
and taught yow best conseil.  
<span id="an_1267"></span> And for as muche as that the examynacion is
necessarie, lat us bigynne at the surgiens  
<span id="an_1267A"></span> and at the phisiciens, that first speeken in
this matiere.  
<span id="an_1268"></span> I sey yow that the surgiens and phisiciens
han seyd yow in youre conseil discreetly, as hem oughte,

<span id="an_1271"></span> And, sire, right as they han answered wisely

<span id="an_1275"></span> but ye oghte the rather gerdone hem and shewe
hem youre largesse.  
<span id="an_1276"></span> And as touchynge the proposicioun which that
the phisiciens encreesceden in this caas -- this is to seyn,  
<span id="an_1277"></span> that in maladies that oon contrarie is
warisshed by another contrarie --  
<span id="an_1278"></span> I wolde fayn knowe hou ye understonde thilke
text, and what is youre sentence."  
<span id="an_1279"></span> "Certes," quod Melibeus, "I understonde it in
this wise:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1280">1280</span></span> that right
as they han doon me a contrarie, right so sholde I doon hem another.  
<span id="an_1281"></span> For right as they han venged hem on me and
doon me wrong,  
<span id="an_1281A"></span> right so shal I venge me upon hem and doon
hem wrong;  
<span id="an_1282"></span> and thanne have I cured oon contrarie by
another."  
<span id="an_1283"></span> "Lo, lo," quod dame Prudence, "how lightly is
every man enclined to his owene desir  
<span id="an_1283A"></span> and to his owene plesaunce!  
<span id="an_1284"></span> Certes," quod she, "the wordes of the
phisiciens ne sholde nat han been understonden in thys wise.  
<span id="an_1285"></span> For certes, wikkednesse is nat contrarie to
wikkednesse, ne vengeance to vengeaunce,  
<span id="an_1285A"></span> ne wrong to wrong, but they been

<span id="an_1286"></span> And therfore o vengeaunce is nat warisshed by

<span id="an_1288"></span> But certes, the wordes of the phisiciens
sholde been understonden in this wise:

and pees and werre, vengeaunce  
<span id="an_1289A"></span> and suffraunce, discord and accord, and

forth of othere thynges.  
<span id="an_1291"></span> And heerto accordeth Seint Paul the Apostle
in manye places.

<span id="an_1294"></span> And in manye othere places he amonesteth pees
and accord.  
<span id="an_1295"></span> But now wol I speke to yow of the conseil
which that was yeven to yow  
<span id="an_1295A"></span> by the men of lawe and the wise folk,  
<span id="an_1296"></span> that seyden alle by oon accord, as ye han

<span id="an_1299"></span> And, sire, as to the firste point, that
toucheth to the kepyng of youre persone,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300">1300</span></span> ye shul

<span id="an_1301A"></span> and been his sovereyn helpyng at his nede.  
<span id="an_1302"></span> For certes, in this world ther is no wight
that may be conseilled ne kept sufficeantly  
<span id="an_1302A"></span> withouten the kepyng of oure Lord Jhesu
Crist.  
<span id="an_1303"></span> To this sentence accordeth the prophete
David, that seith,  
<span id="an_1304"></span> \`If God ne kepe the citee, in ydel waketh he
that it kepeth.'  
<span id="an_1305"></span> Now, sire, thanne shul ye committe the kepyng
of youre persone  
<span id="an_1305A"></span> to youre trewe freendes that been approved
and yknowe,  
<span id="an_1306"></span> and of hem shul ye axen help youre persone

<span id="an_1306A"></span> \`If thou hast nede of help, axe it of thy

alle straunge folk, and fro lyeres,  
<span id="an_1308A"></span> and have alwey in suspect hire compaignye.  
<span id="an_1309"></span> For Piers Alfonce seith, \`Ne taak no

<span id="an_1331A"></span> where as youre wise conseillours conseilled
yow to warnestoore youre hous with gret diligence,  
<span id="an_1332"></span> I wolde fayn knowe how that ye understonde
thilke wordes and what is youre sentence."  
<span id="an_1333"></span> Melibeus answerde and seyde, "Certes, I
understande it in this wise: That I shal warnestoore myn hous with
toures,  
<span id="an_1333A"></span> swiche as han castelles and othere manere
edifices, and armure, and artelries,  
<span id="an_1334"></span> by whiche thynges I may my persone and myn
hous so kepen and deffenden  
<span id="an_1334A"></span> that myne enemys shul been in drede myn hous
for to approche."  
<span id="an_1335"></span> To this sentence answerde anon Prudence:
"Warnestooryng," quod she,  
<span id="an_1335A"></span> "of heighe toures and of grete edifices
apperteyneth somtyme to pryde.  
<span id="an_1336"></span> And eek men make heighe toures, \[and grete
edifices\] with grete costages and with greet travaille,  
<span id="an_1336A"></span> and whan that they been accompliced, yet be
they nat worth a stree,  
<span id="an_1336B"></span> but if they be defended by trewe freendes
that been olde and wise.  
<span id="an_1337"></span> And understoond wel that the gretteste and
strongeste garnysoun that a riche man may have,  
<span id="an_1337A"></span> as wel to kepen his persone as his goodes,
is  
<span id="an_1338"></span> that he be biloved with hys subgetz and with
his neighebores.  
<span id="an_1339"></span> For thus seith Tullius, that \`ther is a
manere garnysoun  
<span id="an_1339A"></span> that no man may venquysse ne disconfite, and
that is  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1340">1340</span></span> a lord to
be biloved of his citezeins and of his peple.'  
<span id="an_1341"></span> Now, sire, as to the thridde point, where as
youre olde  
<span id="an_1341A"></span> and wise conseillours seyden that yow ne
oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden in this nede,  
<span id="an_1342"></span> but that yow oghte purveyen and apparaillen
yow in this caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun;  
<span id="an_1343"></span> trewely, I trowe that they seyden right
wisely and right sooth.  
<span id="an_1344"></span> For Tullius seith, \`In every nede, er thou
bigynne it, apparaille thee with greet diligence.'  
<span id="an_1345"></span> Thanne seye I that in vengeance-takyng, in
werre, in bataille, and in warnestooryng,  
<span id="an_1346"></span> er thow bigynne, I rede that thou apparaille
thee therto, and do it with greet deliberacion.  
<span id="an_1347"></span> For Tullius seith that \`longe apparaillyng
biforn the bataille maketh short victorie.'  
<span id="an_1348"></span> And Cassidorus seith, \`The garnysoun is
stronger whan it is longe tyme avysed.'  
<span id="an_1349"></span> But now lat us speken of the conseil that was
accorded by youre neighebores,  
<span id="an_1349A"></span> swiche as doon yow reverence withouten
love,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1350">1350</span></span> youre olde
enemys reconsiled, youre flatereres,  
<span id="an_1351"></span> that conseilled yow certeyne thynges prively,
and openly conseilleden yow the contrarie;  
<span id="an_1352"></span> the yonge folk also, that conseilleden yow to
venge yow and make werre anon.  
<span id="an_1353"></span> And certes, sire, as I have seyd biforn, ye
han greetly erred  
<span id="an_1353A"></span> to han cleped swich manere folk to youre
conseil,  
<span id="an_1354"></span> which conseillours been ynogh repreved by the
resouns aforeseyd.  
<span id="an_1355"></span> But nathelees, lat us now descende to the
special. Ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of Tullius.  
<span id="an_1356"></span> Certes, the trouthe of this matiere, or of
this conseil, nedeth nat diligently enquere,  
<span id="an_1357"></span> for it is wel wist whiche they been that han
doon to yow this trespas and vileynye,  
<span id="an_1358"></span> and how manye trespassours, and in what
manere  
<span id="an_1358A"></span> they han to yow doon al this wrong and al
this vileynye.  
<span id="an_1359"></span> And after this, thanne shul ye examyne the
seconde condicion which that the same Tullius addeth in this matiere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1360">1360</span></span> For Tullius
put a thyng which that he clepeth \`consentynge'; this is to seyn,  
<span id="an_1361"></span> who been they, and whiche been they and how
manye that consenten to thy conseil  
<span id="an_1361A"></span> in thy wilfulnesse to doon hastif
vengeance.  
<span id="an_1362"></span> And lat us considere also who been they, and
how manye been they,  
<span id="an_1362A"></span> and whiche been they that consenteden to
youre adversaries.  
<span id="an_1363"></span> And certes, as to the firste poynt, it is wel
knowen whiche folk been  
<span id="an_1363A"></span> they that consenteden to youre hastif
wilfulnesse,  
<span id="an_1364"></span> for trewely, alle tho that conseilleden yow
to maken sodeyn werre ne been nat youre freendes.  
<span id="an_1365"></span> Lat us now considere whiche been they that ye
holde so greetly youre freendes as to youre persone.  
<span id="an_1366"></span> For al be it so that ye be myghty and riche,
certes ye ne been but allone,  
<span id="an_1367"></span> for certes ye ne han no child but a
doghter,  
<span id="an_1368"></span> ne ye ne han bretheren, ne cosyns germayns,
ne noon oother neigh kynrede,  
<span id="an_1369"></span> wherfore that youre enemys for drede sholde
stinte to plede with yow or to destroye youre persone.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1370">1370</span></span> Ye knowen
also that youre richesses mooten been dispended in diverse parties,  
<span id="an_1371"></span> and whan that every wight hath his part, they
ne wollen taken but litel reward to venge thy deeth.  
<span id="an_1372"></span> But thyne enemys been thre, and they han
manie children, bretheren, cosyns, and oother ny kynrede.  
<span id="an_1373"></span> And though so were that thou haddest slayn of
hem two or three, yet dwellen ther ynowe  
<span id="an_1373A"></span> to wreken hir deeth and to sle thy
persone.  
<span id="an_1374"></span> And though so be that youre kynrede be moore
siker and stedefast than the kyn of youre adversarie,  
<span id="an_1375"></span> yet nathelees youre kynrede nys but a fer
kynrede; they been but litel syb to yow,  
<span id="an_1376"></span> and the kyn of youre enemys been ny syb to
hem.  
<span id="an_1376A"></span> And certes, as in that, hir condicioun is
bet than youres.  
<span id="an_1377"></span> Thanne lat us considere also if the
conseillyng of hem that conseilleden yow to taken sodeyn vengeaunce,  
<span id="an_1377A"></span> wheither it accorde to resoun.  
<span id="an_1378"></span> And certes, ye knowe wel \`nay.'  
<span id="an_1379"></span> For, as by right and resoun, ther may no man
taken vengeance on no wight  
<span id="an_1379A"></span> but the juge that hath the jurisdiccioun of
it,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1380">1380</span></span> whan it is
graunted hym to take thilke vengeance hastily or attemprely, as the lawe
requireth.  
<span id="an_1381"></span> And yet mooreover of thilke word that Tullius
clepeth \`consentynge,'  
<span id="an_1382"></span> thou shalt considere if thy myght and thy
power may consenten  
<span id="an_1382A"></span> and suffise to thy wilfulnesse and to thy
conseillours.  
<span id="an_1383"></span> And certes thou mayst wel seyn that \`nay.'  
<span id="an_1384"></span> For sikerly, as for to speke proprely, we may
do no thyng  
<span id="an_1384A"></span> but oonly swich thyng as we may doon
rightfully.  
<span id="an_1385"></span> And certes rightfully ne mowe ye take no
vengeance, as of youre propre auctoritee.  
<span id="an_1386"></span> Thanne mowe ye seen that youre power ne
consenteth nat, ne accordeth nat, with youre wilfulnesse.  
<span id="an_1387"></span> "Lat us now examyne the thridde point, that
Tullius clepeth \`consequent.'  
<span id="an_1388"></span> Thou shalt understonde that the vengeance
that thou purposest for to take is the consequent;  
<span id="an_1389"></span> and therof folweth another vengeaunce, peril,
and werre, and othere damages withoute nombre,  
<span id="an_1389A"></span> of whiche we be nat war, as at this tyme.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1390">1390</span></span> And as
touchynge the fourthe point, that Tullius clepeth \`engendrynge,'  
<span id="an_1391"></span> thou shalt considere that this wrong which
that is doon to thee  
<span id="an_1391A"></span> is engendred of the hate of thyne enemys,  
<span id="an_1392"></span> and of the vengeance-takynge upon that wolde
engendre another vengeance,  
<span id="an_1392A"></span> and muchel sorwe and wastynge of richesses,
as I seyde.  
<span id="an_1393"></span> "Now, sire, as to the point that Tullius
clepeth \`causes,' which that is the laste point,  
<span id="an_1394"></span> thou shalt understonde that the wrong that
thou hast receyved hath certeine causes,  
<span id="an_1395"></span> whiche that clerkes clepen Oriens and
Efficiens, and Causa longinqua and Causa propinqua;  
<span id="an_1395A"></span> this is to seyn, the fer cause and the ny
cause.  
<span id="an_1396"></span> The fer cause is almyghty God, that is cause
of alle thynges.  
<span id="an_1397"></span> The neer cause is thy thre enemys.  
<span id="an_1398"></span> The cause accidental was hate.  
<span id="an_1399"></span> The cause material been the fyve woundes of
thy doghter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400">1400</span></span> The cause
formal is the manere of hir werkynge that broghten laddres and cloumben
in at thy wyndowes.  
<span id="an_1401"></span> The cause final was for to sle thy doghter.
It letted nat in as muche as in hem was.  
<span id="an_1402"></span> But for to speken of the fer cause, as to
what ende they shul come, or what shal finally  
<span id="an_1402A"></span> bityde of hem in this caas, ne kan I nat
deeme but by conjectynge and by supposynge.  
<span id="an_1403"></span> For we shul suppose that they shul come to a
wikked ende,  
<span id="an_1404"></span> by cause that the Book of Decrees seith,
\`Seelden, or with greet peyne, been causes ybroght to good ende  
<span id="an_1404A"></span> whanne they been baddely bigonne.'  
<span id="an_1405"></span> "Now, sire, if men wolde axe me why that God
suffred men to do yow this vileynye,  
<span id="an_1405A"></span> certes, I kan nat wel answere, as for no
soothfastnesse.  
<span id="an_1406"></span> For th' apostle seith that \`the sciences and
the juggementz of oure Lord God almyghty been ful depe;  
<span id="an_1407"></span> ther may no man comprehende ne serchen hem
suffisantly.'  
<span id="an_1408"></span> Nathelees, by certeyne presumpciouns and
conjectynges, I holde and bileeve  
<span id="an_1409"></span> that God, which that is ful of justice and of
rightwisnesse, hath suffred this bityde by juste cause resonable.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1410">1410</span></span> "Thy name
is Melibee; this is to seyn, \`a man that drynketh hony.'  
<span id="an_1411"></span> Thou hast ydronke so muchel hony of sweete
temporeel richesses, and delices and honours of this world  
<span id="an_1412"></span> that thou art dronken and hast forgeten Jhesu
Crist thy creatour.  
<span id="an_1413"></span> Thou ne hast nat doon to hym swich honour and
reverence as thee oughte,  
<span id="an_1414"></span> ne thou ne hast nat wel ytaken kep to the
wordes of Ovide, that seith,  
<span id="an_1415"></span> \`Under the hony of the goodes of the body is
hyd the venym that sleeth the soule.'  
<span id="an_1416"></span> And Salomon seith, \`If thou hast founden
hony, ete of it that suffiseth,  
<span id="an_1417"></span> for if thou ete of it out of mesure, thou
shalt spewe' and be nedy and povre.  
<span id="an_1418"></span> And peraventure Crist hath thee in despit,
and  
<span id="an_1418A"></span> hath turned awey fro thee his face and his
eeris of misericorde,  
<span id="an_1419"></span> and also he hath suffred that thou hast been
punysshed in the manere that thow hast ytrespassed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1420">1420</span></span> Thou hast
doon synne agayn oure Lord Crist,  
<span id="an_1421"></span> for certes, the three enemys of mankynde  
<span id="an_1421A"></span> -- that is to seyn, the flessh, the feend,
and the world --  
<span id="an_1422"></span> thou hast suffred hem entre in to thyn herte
wilfully by the wyndowes of thy body,  
<span id="an_1423"></span> and hast nat defended thyself suffisantly
agayns hire assautes and hire temptaciouns,  
<span id="an_1423A"></span> so that they han wounded thy soule in fyve
places;  
<span id="an_1424"></span> this is to seyn, the deedly synnes that been
entred into thyn herte by thy fyve wittes.  
<span id="an_1425"></span> And in the same manere oure Lord Crist hath
woold and suffred  
<span id="an_1425A"></span> that thy three enemys been entred into thyn
house by the wyndowes  
<span id="an_1426"></span> and han ywounded thy doghter in the forseyde
manere."  
<span id="an_1427"></span> "Certes," quod Melibee, "I se wel that ye
enforce yow muchel by wordes to overcome me in swich manere  
<span id="an_1427A"></span> that I shal nat venge me of myne enemys,  
<span id="an_1428"></span> shewynge me the perils and the yveles that
myghten falle of this vengeance.  
<span id="an_1429"></span> But whoso wolde considere in alle vengeances
the perils and yveles that myghte sewe of vengeance-takynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1430">1430</span></span> a man wolde
nevere take vengeance, and that were harm;  
<span id="an_1431"></span> for by the vengeance-takynge been the wikked
men dissevered fro the goode men,  
<span id="an_1432"></span> and they that han wyl to do wikkednesse
restreyne hir wikked purpos,  
<span id="an_1432A"></span> whan they seen the punyssynge and
chastisynge of the trespassours."  
<span id="an_1435"></span> And yet seye I moore, that right as a
singuler persone synneth in takynge vengeance of another man,  
<span id="an_1436"></span> right so synneth the juge if he do no
vengeance of hem that it han disserved.  
<span id="an_1437"></span> For Senec seith thus: \`That maister,' he
seith, \`is good that proveth shrewes.'  
<span id="an_1438"></span> And as Cassidore seith, \`A man dredeth to do
outrages whan he woot and knoweth  
<span id="an_1438A"></span> that it displeseth to the juges and the
sovereyns.'  
<span id="an_1439"></span> And another seith, \`The juge that dredeth to
do right maketh men shrewes.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1440">1440</span></span> And Seint
Paul the Apostle seith in his Epistle, whan he writeth unto the Romayns,
that  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1440A">1440A</span></span> \`the
juges beren nat the spere withouten cause,  
<span id="an_1441"></span> but they beren it to punysse the shrewes and
mysdoers and for to defende the goode men.'  
<span id="an_1442"></span> If ye wol thanne take vengeance of youre
enemys, ye shul retourne or have youre recours to the juge  
<span id="an_1442A"></span> that hath the jurisdiccion upon hem,  
<span id="an_1443"></span> and he shal punysse hem as the lawe axeth and
requireth."  
<span id="an_1444"></span> "A," quod Melibee, "this vengeance liketh me
no thyng.  
<span id="an_1445"></span> I bithenke me now and take heede how Fortune
hath norissed me fro my childhede  
<span id="an_1445A"></span> and hath holpen me to passe many a stroong
paas.  
<span id="an_1446"></span> Now wol I assayen hire, trowynge, with Goddes
help, that she shal helpe me my shame for to venge."  
<span id="an_1447"></span> "Certes," quod Prudence, "if ye wol werke by
my conseil, ye shul nat assaye Fortune by no wey,  
<span id="an_1448"></span> ne ye shul nat lene or bowe unto hire, after
the word of Senec,  
<span id="an_1449"></span> for \`thynges that been folily doon, and that
been in hope of Fortune, shullen nevere come to good ende.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1450">1450</span></span> And, as the
same Senec seith, \`The moore cleer and the moore shynyng that Fortune
is,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1450A">1450A</span></span> the moore
brotil and the sonner broken she is.'  
<span id="an_1451"></span> Trusteth nat in hire, for she nys nat
stidefast ne stable,  
<span id="an_1452"></span> for whan thow trowest to be moost seur or
siker of hire help,  
<span id="an_1452A"></span> she wol faille thee and deceyve thee.  
<span id="an_1453"></span> And where as ye seyn that Fortune hath
norissed yow fro youre childhede,  
<span id="an_1454"></span> I seye that in so muchel shul ye the lasse
truste in hire and in hir wit.  
<span id="an_1455"></span> For Senec seith, \`What man that is norissed
by Fortune, she maketh hym a greet fool.'  
<span id="an_1456"></span> Now thanne, syn ye desire and axe vengeance,
and the vengeance that is doon after the lawe  
<span id="an_1456A"></span> and bifore the juge ne liketh yow nat,  
<span id="an_1457"></span> and the vengeance that is doon in hope of
Fortune is perilous and uncertein,  
<span id="an_1458"></span> thanne have ye noon oother remedie but for to
have youre recours  
<span id="an_1458A"></span> unto the sovereyn Juge that vengeth alle
vileynyes and wronges.  
<span id="an_1459"></span> And he shal venge yow after that hymself
witnesseth, where as he seith,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1460">1460</span></span> \`Leveth
the vengeance to me, and I shal do it.'"  
<span id="an_1461"></span> Melibee answerde, "If I ne venge me nat of
the vileynye that men han doon to me,  
<span id="an_1462"></span> I sompne or warne hem that han doon to me
that vileynye,  
<span id="an_1462A"></span> and alle othere, to do me another
vileynye.  
<span id="an_1463"></span> For it is writen, \`If thou take no vengeance
of an oold vileynye,  
<span id="an_1463A"></span> thou sompnest thyne adversaries to do thee a
newe vileynye.'  
<span id="an_1464"></span> And also for my suffrance men wolden do me so
muchel vileynye that  
<span id="an_1464A"></span> I myghte neither bere it ne susteene,  
<span id="an_1465"></span> and so sholde I been put and holden
overlowe.  
<span id="an_1466"></span> For men seyn, \`In muchel suffrynge shul
manye thynges falle unto thee whiche thou shalt nat mowe suffre.'"  
<span id="an_1467"></span> "Certes," quod Prudence, "I graunte yow that
over-muchel suffraunce is nat good.  
<span id="an_1468"></span> But yet ne folweth it nat therof that every
persone to whom men doon vileynye take of it vengeance,  
<span id="an_1469"></span> for that aperteneth and longeth al oonly to
the juges, for they shul venge the vileynyes and injuries.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1470">1470</span></span> And
therfore tho two auctoritees that ye han seyd above been oonly
understonden in the juges,  
<span id="an_1471"></span> for whan they suffren over-muchel the wronges
and the vileynyes to be doon withouten punysshynge,  
<span id="an_1472"></span> they sompne nat a man al oonly for to do newe
wronges, but they comanden it.  
<span id="an_1473"></span> Also a wys man seith that \`the juge that
correcteth nat the synnere comandeth and biddeth hym do synne.'  
<span id="an_1474"></span> And the juges and sovereyns myghten in hir
land so muchel suffre of the shrewes and mysdoeres  
<span id="an_1475"></span> that they sholden, by swich suffrance, by
proces of tyme wexen of swich power and myght  
<span id="an_1475A"></span> that they sholden putte out the juges and
the sovereyns from hir places,  
<span id="an_1476"></span> and atte laste maken hem lesen hire
lordshipes.  
<span id="an_1477"></span> "But lat us now putte that ye have leve to
venge yow.  
<span id="an_1478"></span> I seye ye been nat of myght and power as now
to venge yow,  
<span id="an_1479"></span> for if ye wole maken comparisoun unto the

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1480">1480</span></span> And
therfore seye I that it is good as now that ye suffre and be pacient.  
<span id="an_1481"></span> "Forthermoore, ye knowen wel that after the

<span id="an_1482"></span> and for to stryve with a man of evene

<span id="an_1482A"></span> with as strong a man as he is -- it is
peril,  
<span id="an_1483"></span> and for to stryve with a weyker man, it is
folie.'  
<span id="an_1484"></span> And therfore sholde a man flee stryvynge as
muchel as he myghte.  
<span id="an_1485"></span> For Salomon seith, \`It is a greet worshipe
to a man to kepen hym fro noyse and stryf.'  
<span id="an_1486"></span> And if it so bifalle or happe that a man of
gretter myght and strengthe  
<span id="an_1486A"></span> than thou art do thee grevaunce,  
<span id="an_1487"></span> studie and bisye thee rather to stille the
same grevaunce than for to venge thee.  
<span id="an_1488"></span> For Senec seith that \`he putteth hym in
greet peril  
<span id="an_1488A"></span> that stryveth with a gretter man than he is
hymself.'  
<span id="an_1489"></span> And Catoun seith, \`If a man of hyer estaat
or degree, or moore myghty than thou,  
<span id="an_1489A"></span> do thee anoy or grevaunce, suffre hym,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1490">1490</span></span> for he that
oones hath greved thee, may another tyme releeve thee and helpe.'  
<span id="an_1491"></span> Yet sette I caas ye have bothe myght and
licence for to venge yow,  
<span id="an_1492"></span> I seye that ther be ful manye thynges that
shul restreyne yow of vengeance-takynge  
<span id="an_1493"></span> and make yow for to enclyne to suffre, and
for to han pacience  
<span id="an_1493A"></span> in the wronges that han been doon to yow.  
<span id="an_1494"></span> First and foreward, if ye wole considere the
defautes that been in youre owene persone,  
<span id="an_1495"></span> for whiche defautes God hath suffred yow have
this tribulacioun, as I have seyd yow heer-biforn.  
<span id="an_1496"></span> For the poete seith that \`we oghte paciently
taken the tribulacions  
<span id="an_1496A"></span> that comen to us, whan we thynken and
consideren that we han disserved to have hem.'  
<span id="an_1497"></span> And Seint Gregorie seith that \`whan a man
considereth wel the nombre of his defautes and of his synnes,  
<span id="an_1498"></span> the peynes and the tribulaciouns that he
suffreth semen the lesse unto hym;  
<span id="an_1499"></span> and in as muche as hym thynketh his synnes
moore hevy and grevous,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500">1500</span></span> in so muche
semeth his peyne the lighter and the esier unto hym.'  
<span id="an_1501"></span> Also ye owen to enclyne and bowe youre
herte  
<span id="an_1501A"></span> to take the pacience of oure Lord Jhesu
Crist, as seith Seint Peter in his Epistles.  
<span id="an_1502"></span> \`Jhesu Crist,' he seith, \`hath suffred for
us and yeven ensample to every man to folwe and sewe hym,  
<span id="an_1503"></span> for he dide nevere synne, ne nevere cam ther
a vileyns word out of his mouth.  
<span id="an_1504"></span> Whan men cursed hym, he cursed hem noght, and
whan men betten hym, he manaced hem noght.'  
<span id="an_1505"></span> Also the grete pacience which the seintes
that been in Paradys han had in tribulaciouns  
<span id="an_1505A"></span> that they han ysuffred, withouten hir desert
or gilt,  
<span id="an_1506"></span> oghte muchel stiren yow to pacience.  
<span id="an_1507"></span> Forthermoore ye sholde enforce yow to have
pacience,  
<span id="an_1508"></span> considerynge that the tribulaciouns of this
world but litel while endure and soone passed been and goon,  
<span id="an_1509"></span> and the joye that a man seketh to have by
pacience in tribulaciouns is perdurable,  
<span id="an_1509A"></span> after that the Apostle seith in his
epistle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1510">1510</span></span> \`The joye
of God,' he seith, \`is perdurable' -- that is to seyn, everelastynge.  
<span id="an_1511"></span> Also troweth and bileveth stedefastly that he
nys nat wel ynorissed, ne wel ytaught,  
<span id="an_1511A"></span> that kan nat have pacience or wol nat
receyve pacience.  
<span id="an_1512"></span> For Salomon seith that \`the doctrine and the
wit of a man is knowen by pacience.'  
<span id="an_1513"></span> And in another place he seith that \`he that
is pacient governeth hym by greet prudence.'  
<span id="an_1514"></span> And the same Salomon seith, \`The angry and
wrathful man maketh noyses,  
<span id="an_1514A"></span> and the pacient man atempreth hem and
stilleth.'  
<span id="an_1515"></span> He seith also, \`It is moore worth to be
pacient than for to be right strong;  
<span id="an_1516"></span> and he that may have the lordshipe of his
owene herte is moore to preyse than he that  
<span id="an_1516A"></span> by his force or strengthe taketh grete
citees.'  
<span id="an_1517"></span> And therfore seith Seint Jame in his Epistle
that \`pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun.'"  
<span id="an_1518"></span> "Certes," quod Melibee, "I graunte yow, dame
Prudence, that pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun;  
<span id="an_1519"></span> but every man may nat have the perfeccioun
that ye seken;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1520">1520</span></span> ne I nam
nat of the nombre of right parfite men,  
<span id="an_1521"></span> for myn herte may nevere been in pees unto
the tyme it be venged.  
<span id="an_1522"></span> And al be it so that it was greet peril to
myne enemys  
<span id="an_1522A"></span> to do me a vileynye in takynge vengeance
upon me,  
<span id="an_1523"></span> yet tooken they noon heede of the peril, but
fulfilleden hir wikked wyl and hir corage.  
<span id="an_1524"></span> And therfore me thynketh men oghten nat
repreve me,  
<span id="an_1524A"></span> though I putte me in a litel peril for to
venge me,  
<span id="an_1525"></span> and though I do a greet excesse; that is to
seyn, that I venge oon outrage by another."  
<span id="an_1526"></span> "A," quod dame Prudence, "ye seyn youre wyl
and as yow liketh,  
<span id="an_1527"></span> but in no caas of the world a man sholde nat
doon outrage ne excesse for to vengen hym.  
<span id="an_1528"></span> For Cassidore seith that \`as yvele dooth he
that vengeth hym by outrage as he that dooth the outrage.'  
<span id="an_1529"></span> And therfore ye shul venge yow after the
ordre of right; that is to seyn, by the lawe  
<span id="an_1529A"></span> and noght by excesse ne by outrage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1530">1530</span></span> And also,
if ye wol venge yow of the outrage of youre adversaries  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1530A">1530A</span></span> in oother
manere than right comandeth, ye synnen.  
<span id="an_1531"></span> And therfore seith Senec that \`a man shal
nevere vengen shrewednesse by shrewednesse.'  
<span id="an_1532"></span> And if ye seye that right axeth a man to
defenden violence by violence and fightyng by fightyng,  
<span id="an_1533"></span> certes ye seye sooth, whan the defense is
doon anon withouten intervalle or withouten tariyng or delay,  
<span id="an_1534"></span> for to deffenden hym and nat for to vengen
hym.  
<span id="an_1535"></span> And it bihoveth that a man putte swich
attemperance in his deffense  
<span id="an_1536"></span> that men have no cause ne matiere to repreven

yow;  
<span id="an_1538"></span> and so seweth it that ye han no wyl to do
youre dede attemprely.  
<span id="an_1539"></span> And therfore me thynketh that pacience is
good. For Salomon seith that  
<span id="an_1539A"></span> \`he that is nat pacient shal have greet
harm.'"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1540">1540</span></span> "Certes,"
quod Melibee, "I graunte yow that whan a man is inpacient and wrooth of
that  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1540A">1540A</span></span> that
toucheth hym noght and that aperteneth nat unto hym, though it harme
hym, it is no wonder.  
<span id="an_1541"></span> For the lawe seith that \`he is coupable that
entremetteth hym  
<span id="an_1541A"></span> or medleth with swych thyng as aperteneth
nat unto hym.'  
<span id="an_1542"></span> And Salomon seith that \`he that entremetteth
hym of the noyse or strif of another man  
<span id="an_1542A"></span> is lyk to hym that taketh an hound by the
eris.'  
<span id="an_1543"></span> For right as he that taketh a straunge hound
by the eris is outherwhile biten with the hound,  
<span id="an_1544"></span> right in the same wise is it resoun that he
have harm that by his inpacience medleth hym

aperteneth nat unto hym.  
<span id="an_1545"></span> But ye knowen wel that this dede -- that is

<span id="an_1546"></span> And therfore, though I be wrooth and

<span id="an_1547"></span> And, savynge youre grace, I kan nat seen that
it myghte greetly harme me though I tooke vengeaunce.  
<span id="an_1548"></span> For I am richer and moore myghty than myne
enemys been;  
<span id="an_1549"></span> and wel knowen ye that by moneye and by
havynge grete possessions  
<span id="an_1549A"></span> been alle the thynges of this world
governed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1550">1550</span></span> And Salomon
seith that \`alle thynges obeyen to moneye.'"  
<span id="an_1551"></span> Whan Prudence hadde herd hir housbonde
avanten hym of his richesse  
<span id="an_1551A"></span> and of his moneye, dispreisynge the power of
his adversaries,  
<span id="an_1551B"></span> she spak and seyde in this wise:  
<span id="an_1552"></span> "Certes, deere sire, I graunte yow that ye
been riche and myghty  
<span id="an_1553"></span> and that the richesses been goode to hem that
han wel ygeten hem and wel konne usen hem.  
<span id="an_1554"></span> For right as the body of a man may nat lyven
withoute the soule,  
<span id="an_1554A"></span> namoore may it lyve withouten temporeel
goodes.  
<span id="an_1555"></span> And by richesses may a man gete hym grete
freendes.  
<span id="an_1556"></span> And therfore seith Pamphilles: \`If a
net-herdes doghter,' seith he, \`be riche,  
<span id="an_1556A"></span> she may chesen of a thousand men which she
wol take to hir housbonde,  
<span id="an_1557"></span> for, of a thousand men, oon wol nat forsaken
hire ne refusen hire.'  
<span id="an_1558"></span> And this Pamphilles seith also, \`If thow be
right happy -- that is to seyn,  
<span id="an_1558A"></span> if thou be right riche -- thou shalt fynde a
greet nombre of felawes and freendes.  
<span id="an_1559"></span> And if thy fortune change that thou wexe
povre, farewel freendshipe and felaweshipe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1560">1560</span></span> for thou
shalt be alloone withouten any compaignye, but if it be the compaignye
of povre folk.'  
<span id="an_1561"></span> And yet seith this Pamphilles moreover that
\`they that been thralle and bonde of lynage  
<span id="an_1561A"></span> shullen been maad worthy and noble by the
richesses.'  
<span id="an_1562"></span> And right so as by richesses ther comen manye
goodes,  
<span id="an_1562A"></span> right so by poverte come ther manye harmes
and yveles,  
<span id="an_1563"></span> for greet poverte constreyneth a man to do
manye yveles.  
<span id="an_1564"></span> And therfore clepeth Cassidore poverte the
mooder of ruyne;  
<span id="an_1565"></span> that is to seyn, the mooder of overthrowynge
or fallynge doun.  
<span id="an_1566"></span> And therfore seith Piers Alfonce, \`Oon of
the gretteste adversitees of this world is  
<span id="an_1567"></span> whan a free man by kynde or of burthe is
constreyned by poverte  
<span id="an_1567A"></span> to eten the almesse of his enemy,'  
<span id="an_1568"></span> and the same seith Innocent in oon of his
bookes. He seith that  
<span id="an_1568A"></span> \`sorweful and myshappy is the condicioun of
a povre beggere;  
<span id="an_1569"></span> for if he axe nat his mete, he dyeth for

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1570">1570</span></span> and if he
axe, he dyeth for shame; and algates necessitee constreyneth hym to
axe.'  
<span id="an_1571"></span> And seith Salomon that \`bet it is to dye
than for to have swich poverte.'  
<span id="an_1572"></span> And as the same Salomon seith, \`Bettre it is
to dye of bitter deeth  
<span id="an_1572A"></span> than for to lyven in swich wise.'  
<span id="an_1573"></span> By thise resons that I have seid unto yow and
by manye othere resons that I koude seye,  
<span id="an_1574"></span> I graunte yow that richesses been goode to
hem that geten hem wel  
<span id="an_1574A"></span> and to hem that wel usen tho richesses.  
<span id="an_1575"></span> And therfore wol I shewe yow hou ye shul have
yow, and how ye shul bere yow  
<span id="an_1575A"></span> in gaderynge of richesses, and in what
manere ye shul usen hem.  
<span id="an_1576"></span> "First, ye shul geten hem withouten greet
desir, by good leyser, sokyngly and nat over-hastily.  
<span id="an_1577"></span> For a man that is to desirynge to gete
richesses abaundoneth hym  
<span id="an_1577A"></span> first to thefte, and to alle othere
yveles;  
<span id="an_1578"></span> and therfore seith Salomon, \`He that hasteth
hym to bisily to wexe riche shal be noon innocent.'  
<span id="an_1579"></span> He seith also that \`the richesse that
hastily cometh to a man soone  
<span id="an_1579A"></span> and lightly gooth and passeth fro a man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1580">1580</span></span> but that
richesse that cometh litel and litel wexeth alwey and multiplieth.'  
<span id="an_1581"></span> And, sire, ye shul geten richesses by youre
wit and by youre travaille unto youre profit,  
<span id="an_1582"></span> and that withouten wrong or harm doynge to
any oother persone.  
<span id="an_1583"></span> For the lawe seith that \`ther maketh no man
himselven riche, if he do harm to another wight.'  
<span id="an_1584"></span> This is to seyn, that nature deffendeth and
forbedeth by right that  
<span id="an_1584A"></span> no man make hymself riche unto the harm of
another persone.  
<span id="an_1585"></span> And Tullius seith that \`no sorwe, ne no
drede of deeth, ne no thyng  
<span id="an_1585A"></span> that may falle unto a man, is so muchel
agayns  
<span id="an_1586"></span> nature as a man to encressen his owene profit
to the harm of another man.  
<span id="an_1587"></span> And though the grete men and the myghty men
geten richesses moore lightly than thou,  
<span id="an_1588"></span> yet shaltou nat been ydel ne slow to do thy
profit, for thou shalt in alle wise flee ydelnesse.'  
<span id="an_1589"></span> For Salomon seith that \`ydelnesse techeth a
man to do manye yveles.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1590">1590</span></span> And the
same Salomon seith that \`he that travailleth and bisieth hym to tilien
his land shal eten breed,  
<span id="an_1591"></span> but he that is ydel and casteth hym to no
bisynesse  
<span id="an_1591A"></span> ne occupacioun shal falle into poverte and
dye for hunger.'  
<span id="an_1592"></span> And he that is ydel and slow kan nevere fynde
covenable tyme for to doon his profit.  
<span id="an_1593"></span> For ther is a versifiour seith that \`the
ydel man excuseth hym in wynter by cause  
<span id="an_1593A"></span> of the grete coold, and in somer by
enchesoun of the greete heete.'  
<span id="an_1594"></span> For thise causes seith Caton, \`Waketh and
enclyneth nat yow over-muchel for to slepe,  
<span id="an_1594A"></span> for over-muchel reste norisseth and causeth
manye vices.'  
<span id="an_1595"></span> And therfore seith Seint Jerome, \`Dooth
somme goode dedes that the devel,  
<span id="an_1595A"></span> which is oure enemy, ne fynde yow nat
unocupied.'  
<span id="an_1596"></span> For the devel ne taketh nat lightly unto his
werkynge swiche as he fyndeth occupied in goode werkes.  
<span id="an_1597"></span> "Thanne thus in getynge richesses ye mosten
flee ydelnesse.  
<span id="an_1598"></span> And afterward, ye shul use the richesses
which ye have geten by youre wit and by youre travaille  
<span id="an_1599"></span> in swich a manere that men holde yow nat to
scars, ne to sparynge, ne to fool-large  
<span id="an_1599A"></span> -- that is to seyen, over-large a
spendere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600">1600</span></span> For right
as men blamen an avaricious man by cause of his scarsetee and
chyncherie,  
<span id="an_1601"></span> in the same wise is he to blame that spendeth
over-largely.  
<span id="an_1602"></span> And therfore seith Caton: \`Use,' he seith,
\`thy richesses that thou hast geten  
<span id="an_1603"></span> in swich a manere that men have no matiere ne
cause to calle thee neither wrecche ne chynche,  
<span id="an_1604"></span> for it is a greet shame to a man to have a
povere herte and a riche purs.'  
<span id="an_1605"></span> He seith also, \`The goodes that thou hast
ygeten, use hem by mesure;'  
<span id="an_1605A"></span> that is to seyn, spende hem mesurably,  
<span id="an_1606"></span> for they that folily wasten and despenden the
goodes that they han,  
<span id="an_1607"></span> whan they han namoore propre of hir owene,
they shapen hem to take the goodes of another man.  
<span id="an_1608"></span> I seye thanne that ye shul fleen avarice,  
<span id="an_1609"></span> usynge youre richesses in swich manere that
men seye nat that youre richesses been yburyed  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1610">1610</span></span> but that ye
have hem in youre myght and in youre weeldynge.  
<span id="an_1611"></span> For a wys man repreveth the avaricious man,
and seith thus in two vers:  
<span id="an_1612"></span> \`Wherto and why burieth a man his goodes by
his grete avarice,  
<span id="an_1612A"></span> and knoweth wel that nedes moste he dye?  
<span id="an_1613"></span> For deeth is the ende of every man as in this
present lyf.'  
<span id="an_1614"></span> And for what cause or enchesoun joyneth he
hym or knytteth he hym so faste unto his goodes  
<span id="an_1615"></span> that alle hise wittes mowen nat disseveren
hym or departen hym from his goodes,  
<span id="an_1616"></span> and knoweth wel, or oghte knowe, that whan he
is deed  
<span id="an_1616A"></span> he shal no thyng bere with hym out of this
world?  
<span id="an_1617"></span> And therfore seith Seint Austyn that \`the
avaricious man is likned unto helle,  
<span id="an_1618"></span> that the moore it swelweth the moore desir it
hath to swelwe and devoure.'  
<span id="an_1619"></span> And as wel as ye wolde eschewe to be called
an avaricious man or chynche,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1620">1620</span></span> as wel
sholde ye kepe yow and governe yow in swich a wise that men calle yow
nat fool-large.  
<span id="an_1621"></span> Therfore seith Tullius: \`The goodes,' he
seith, \`of thyn hous ne sholde nat been hyd ne kept so cloos,  
<span id="an_1621A"></span> but that they myghte been opened by pitee
and debonairetee'  
<span id="an_1622"></span> (that is to seyn, to yeven part to hem that
han greet nede),  
<span id="an_1623"></span> \`ne thy goodes shullen nat been so opene to
been every mannes goodes.'  
<span id="an_1624"></span> Afterward, in getynge of youre richesses and
in usynge hem ye shul alwey have thre thynges in youre herte  
<span id="an_1625"></span> (that is to seyn, oure Lord God, conscience,
and good name).  
<span id="an_1626"></span> First, ye shul have God in youre herte,  
<span id="an_1627"></span> and for no richesse ye shullen do no thyng
which may in any manere displese God,  
<span id="an_1627A"></span> that is youre creatour and makere.  
<span id="an_1628"></span> For after the word of Salomon, \`It is bettre
to have a litel good with the love of God  
<span id="an_1629"></span> than to have muchel good and tresour and lese
the love of his Lord God.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1630">1630</span></span> And the
prophete seith that \`bettre it is to been a good man and have litel
good and tresour  
<span id="an_1631"></span> than to been holden a shrewe and have grete

<span id="an_1632"></span> And yet seye I ferthermoore, that ye sholde
alwey doon youre bisynesse to gete yow richesses,  
<span id="an_1633"></span> so that ye gete hem with good conscience.  
<span id="an_1634"></span> And th' Apostle seith that \`ther nys thyng
in this world of which  
<span id="an_1634A"></span> we sholden have so greet joye as whan oure
conscience bereth us good witnesse.'  
<span id="an_1635"></span> And the wise man seith, \`The substance of a
man is ful good,  
<span id="an_1635A"></span> whan synne is nat in mannes conscience.'  
<span id="an_1636"></span> Afterward, in getynge of youre richesses and
in usynge of hem,  
<span id="an_1637"></span> yow moste have greet bisynesse and greet
diligence that youre goode name be alwey kept and conserved.  
<span id="an_1638"></span> For Salomon seith that \`bettre it is and
moore it availleth a man to have a good name  
<span id="an_1638A"></span> than for to have grete richesses.'  
<span id="an_1639"></span> And therfore he seith in another place, \`Do
greet diligence,' seith Salomon,  
<span id="an_1639A"></span> \`in kepyng of thy freend and of thy goode
name;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1640">1640</span></span> for it shal
lenger abide with thee than any tresour, be it never so precious.'  
<span id="an_1641"></span> And certes he sholde nat be called a gentil
man that after God and good conscience, alle thynges left,  
<span id="an_1641A"></span> ne dooth his diligence and bisynesse to
kepen his goode name.  
<span id="an_1642"></span> And Cassidore seith that \`it is signe of a
gentil herte  
<span id="an_1642A"></span> whan a man loveth and desireth to han a good
name.'  
<span id="an_1643"></span> And therfore seith Seint Austyn that \`ther
been two thynges that arn necessarie and nedefulle,  
<span id="an_1644"></span> and that is good conscience and good loos;  
<span id="an_1645"></span> that is to seyn, good conscience to thyn
owene persone inward and good loos for thy neighebor outward.'  
<span id="an_1646"></span> And he that trusteth hym so muchel in his
goode conscience  
<span id="an_1647"></span> that he displeseth, and setteth at noght his
goode name or loos,  
<span id="an_1647A"></span> and rekketh noght though he kepe nat his
goode name, nys but a crueel cherl.  
<span id="an_1648"></span> "Sire, now have I shewed yow how ye shul do
in getynge richesses, and how ye shullen usen hem,  
<span id="an_1649"></span> and I se wel that for the trust that ye han
in youre richesses  
<span id="an_1649A"></span> ye wole moeve werre and bataille.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1650">1650</span></span> I conseille
yow that ye bigynne no werre in trust of youre richesses,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1650A">1650A</span></span> for they
ne suffisen noght werres to mayntene.  
<span id="an_1651"></span> And therfore seith a philosophre, \`That man
that desireth and wole algates han werre, shal nevere have
suffisaunce,  
<span id="an_1652"></span> for the richer that he is, the gretter
despenses moste he make, if he wole have worshipe and victorie.'  
<span id="an_1653"></span> And Salomon seith that \`the gretter
richesses that a man hath, the mo despendours he hath.'  
<span id="an_1654"></span> And, deere sire, al be it so that for youre
richesses ye mowe have muchel folk,  
<span id="an_1655"></span> yet bihoveth it nat, ne it is nat good, to
bigynne werre whereas ye mowe  
<span id="an_1655A"></span> in oother manere have pees unto youre
worshipe and profit.  
<span id="an_1656"></span> For the victorie of batailles that been in
this world lyth nat in greet nombre or multitude  
<span id="an_1656A"></span> of the peple, ne in the vertu of man,  
<span id="an_1657"></span> but it lith in the wyl and in the hand of
oure Lord God Almyghty.  
<span id="an_1658"></span> And therfore Judas Machabeus, which was
Goddes knyght,  
<span id="an_1659"></span> whan he sholde fighte agayn his adversarie
that hadde a gretter nombre  
<span id="an_1659A"></span> and a gretter multitude of folk and strenger
than was this peple of Machabee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1660">1660</span></span> yet he
reconforted his litel compaignye, and seyde right in this wise:  
<span id="an_1661"></span> \`Als lightly,' quod he, \`may oure Lord God
Almyghty yeve victorie to a fewe folk as to many folk,  
<span id="an_1662"></span> for the victorie of a bataile comth nat by
the grete nombre of peple,  
<span id="an_1663"></span> but it cometh from oure Lord God of
hevene.'  
<span id="an_1664"></span> And, deere sire, for as muchel as ther is no
man certein if he be worthy that  
<span id="an_1664A"></span> God yeve hym victorie . . . or naught, after
that Salomon seith,  
<span id="an_1665"></span> therfore every man sholde greetly drede
werres to bigynne.  
<span id="an_1666"></span> And by cause that in batailles fallen manye
perils,  
<span id="an_1667"></span> and happeth outher while that as soone is the
grete man slayn as the litel man;  
<span id="an_1668"></span> and as it is writen in the seconde Book of
Kynges,  
<span id="an_1668A"></span> \`The dedes of batailles been aventurouse
and nothyng certeyne,  
<span id="an_1669"></span> for as lightly is oon hurt with a spere as

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1670">1670</span></span> and for
ther is gret peril in werre, therfore sholde a man flee and eschue
werre,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1670A">1670A</span></span> in as
muchel as a man may goodly.  
<span id="an_1671"></span> For Salomon seith, \`He that loveth peril
shal falle in peril.'"  
<span id="an_1672"></span> After that Dame Prudence hadde spoken in this
manere, Melibee answerde and seyde,  
<span id="an_1673"></span> "I see wel, dame Prudence, that by youre
faire wordes and by youre resouns  
<span id="an_1673A"></span> that ye han shewed me, that the werre liketh
yow no thyng;  
<span id="an_1674"></span> but I have nat yet herd youre conseil, how I
shal do in this nede."  
<span id="an_1675"></span> "Certes," quod she, "I conseille yow that ye
accorde with youre adversaries and that ye have pees with hem.  
<span id="an_1676"></span> For Seint Jame seith in his Epistles that
\`by concord and pees the smale richesses wexen grete,  
<span id="an_1677"></span> and by debaat and discord the grete richesses
fallen doun.'  
<span id="an_1678"></span> And ye knowen wel that oon of the gretteste
and moost sovereyn thyng  
<span id="an_1678A"></span> that is in this world is unytee and pees.  
<span id="an_1679"></span> And therfore seyde oure Lord Jhesu Crist to
his apostles in this wise:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1680">1680</span></span> \`Wel happy
and blessed been they that loven and purchacen pees, for they been
called children of God.'"  
<span id="an_1681"></span> "A," quod Melibee, "now se I wel that ye
loven nat myn honour ne my worshipe.  
<span id="an_1682"></span> Ye knowen wel that myne adversaries han
bigonnen this debaat and bryge by hire outrage,  
<span id="an_1683"></span> and ye se wel that they ne requeren ne preyen
me nat of pees,  
<span id="an_1683A"></span> ne they asken nat to be reconsiled.  
<span id="an_1684"></span> Wol ye thanne that I go and meke me, and
obeye me to hem, and crie hem mercy?  
<span id="an_1685"></span> For sothe, that were nat my worshipe.  
<span id="an_1686"></span> For right as men seyn that \`over-greet
hoomlynesse engendreth dispreisynge,' so fareth it by to greet humylitee
or mekenesse."  
<span id="an_1687"></span> Thanne bigan dame Prudence to maken semblant
of wratthe and seyde:  
<span id="an_1688"></span> "Certes, sire, sauf youre grace, I love youre
honour and youre profit  
<span id="an_1688A"></span> as I do myn owene, and evere have doon;  
<span id="an_1689"></span> ne ye, ne noon oother, seyn nevere the
contrarie.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1690">1690</span></span> And yit if
I hadde seyd that ye sholde han purchaced the pees  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1690A">1690A</span></span> and the
reconsiliacioun, I ne hadde nat muchel mystaken me ne seyd amys.  
<span id="an_1691"></span> For the wise man seith, \`The dissensioun
bigynneth by another man, and the reconsilyng bygynneth by thyself.'  
<span id="an_1692"></span> And the prophete seith, \`Flee shrewednesse
and do goodnesse;  
<span id="an_1693"></span> seke pees and folwe it, as muchel as in thee

<span id="an_1694"></span> Yet seye I nat that ye shul rather pursue to
youre adversaries for pees than they shuln to yow.  
<span id="an_1695"></span> For I knowe wel that ye been so hard-herted
that ye wol do no thyng for me.  
<span id="an_1696"></span> And Salomon seith, \`He that hath over-hard
an herte, atte laste he shal myshappe and mystyde.'"  
<span id="an_1697"></span> Whanne Melibee hadde herd dame Prudence maken
semblant of wratthe, he seyde in this wise:  
<span id="an_1698"></span> "Dame, I prey yow that ye be nat displesed of
thynges that I seye,  
<span id="an_1699"></span> for ye knowe wel that I am angry and wrooth,
and that is no wonder;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700">1700</span></span> and they
that been wrothe witen nat wel what they don ne what they seyn.  
<span id="an_1701"></span> Therfore the prophete seith that \`troubled
eyen han no cleer sighte.'  
<span id="an_1702"></span> But seyeth and conseileth me as yow liketh,
for I am redy to do right as ye wol desire;  
<span id="an_1703"></span> and if ye repreve me of my folye,  
<span id="an_1703A"></span> I am the moore holden to love yow and to
preyse yow.  
<span id="an_1704"></span> For Salomon seith that \`he that repreveth
hym that dooth folye,  
<span id="an_1705"></span> he shal fynde gretter grace than he that
deceyveth hym by sweete wordes.'"  
<span id="an_1706"></span> Thanne seide dame Prudence, "I make no
semblant of wratthe ne anger, but for youre grete profit.  
<span id="an_1707"></span> For Salomon seith, \`He is moore worth that
repreveth or chideth a fool for his folye,  
<span id="an_1707A"></span> shewynge hym semblant of wratthe,  
<span id="an_1708"></span> than he that supporteth hym and preyseth hym
in his mysdoynge and laugheth at his folye.'  
<span id="an_1709"></span> And this same Salomon seith afterward that  
<span id="an_1709A"></span> \`by the sorweful visage of a man'  
<span id="an_1709B"></span> (that is to seyn by the sory and hevy

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1710">1710</span></span> \`the fool
correcteth and amendeth hymself.'"  
<span id="an_1711"></span> Thanne seyde Melibee, "I shal nat konne

<span id="an_1711A"></span> so manye faire resouns as ye putten to me
and shewen.  
<span id="an_1712"></span> Seyeth shortly youre wyl and youre conseil,
and I am al redy to fulfille and parfourne it."  
<span id="an_1713"></span> Thanne dame Prudence discovered al hir wyl to
hym and seyde,  
<span id="an_1714"></span> "I conseille yow," quod she, "aboven alle
thynges, that ye make pees bitwene God and yow,  
<span id="an_1715"></span> and beth reconsiled unto hym and to his

<span id="an_1716"></span> For, as I have seyd yow heer biforn, God hath
suffred yow  
<span id="an_1716A"></span> to have this tribulacioun and disese for
youre synnes.  
<span id="an_1717"></span> And if ye do as I sey yow, God wol sende
youre adversaries unto yow  
<span id="an_1718"></span> and maken hem fallen at youre feet, redy to

<span id="an_1719"></span> For Salomon seith, \`Whan the condicioun of

<span id="an_1723"></span> And thanne, whan I knowe hir wil and hire
entente, I may conseille yow the moore seurely."  
<span id="an_1724"></span> "Dame," quod Melibee, "dooth youre wil and
youre likynge;  
<span id="an_1725"></span> for I putte me hoolly in youre disposicioun
and ordinaunce."  
<span id="an_1726"></span> Thanne dame Prudence, whan she saugh the
goode wyl of hir housbonde, delibered and took avys in hirself,  
<span id="an_1727"></span> thinkinge how she myghte brynge this nede
unto a good conclusioun and to a good ende.  
<span id="an_1728"></span> And whan she saugh hir tyme, she sente for
thise adversaries to come unto hire into a pryvee place  
<span id="an_1729"></span> and shewed wisely unto hem the grete goodes
that comen of pees  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1730">1730</span></span> and the
grete harmes and perils that been in werre,  
<span id="an_1731"></span> and seyde to hem in a goodly manere hou that
hem oughten have greet repentaunce  
<span id="an_1732"></span> of the injurie and wrong that they hadden
doon to Melibee hir lord,  
<span id="an_1732A"></span> and unto hire, and to hire doghter.  
<span id="an_1733"></span> And whan they herden the goodliche wordes of
dame Prudence,  
<span id="an_1734"></span> they weren so supprised and ravysshed and
hadden so greet joye of hire that wonder was to telle.  
<span id="an_1735"></span> "A, lady," quod they, "ye han shewed unto us
the blessynge of swetnesse,

<span id="an_1743"></span> And therfore, deere and benygne lady, we

<span id="an_1793"></span> she was wonderly glad in hire herte and
seyde:  
<span id="an_1794"></span> "Ther is an old proverbe," quod she, "seith
that \`the goodnesse that thou mayst do this day, do it,  
<span id="an_1795"></span> and abide nat ne delaye it nat til
tomorwe.'  
<span id="an_1796"></span> And therfore I conseille that ye sende youre
messages, swiche as been discrete and wise,  
<span id="an_1797"></span> unto youre adversaries, tellynge hem on youre
bihalve  
<span id="an_1798"></span> that if they wole trete of pees and of
accord,  
<span id="an_1799"></span> that they shape hem withouten delay or
tariyng to comen unto us."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800">1800</span></span> Which thyng
parfourned was in dede.  
<span id="an_1801"></span> And whanne thise trespassours and repentynge
folk of hire folies  
<span id="an_1801A"></span> -- that is to seyn, the adversaries of
Melibee --  
<span id="an_1802"></span> hadden herd what thise messagers seyden unto
hem,  
<span id="an_1803"></span> they weren right glad and joyeful, and
answereden ful mekely and benignely,  
<span id="an_1804"></span> yeldynge graces and thankynges to hir lord
Melibee and to al his compaignye,  
<span id="an_1805"></span> and shopen hem withouten delay to go with the
messagers and obeye to the comandement of hir lord Melibee.  
<span id="an_1806"></span> And right anon they tooken hire wey to the
court of Melibee,  
<span id="an_1807"></span> and tooken with hem somme of hire trewe
freendes  
<span id="an_1807A"></span> to maken feith for hem and for to been hire
borwes.  
<span id="an_1808"></span> And whan they were comen to the presence of
Melibee, he seyde hem thise wordes:  
<span id="an_1809"></span> "It standeth thus," quod Melibee, "and sooth
it is, that ye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1810">1810</span></span> causelees
and withouten skile and resoun,  
<span id="an_1811"></span> han doon grete injuries and wronges to me and
to my wyf Prudence and to my doghter also.  
<span id="an_1812"></span> For ye han entred into myn hous by
violence,  
<span id="an_1813"></span> and have doon swich outrage that alle men
knowen wel that ye have disserved the deeth.  
<span id="an_1814"></span> And therfore wol I knowe and wite of yow  
<span id="an_1815"></span> wheither ye wol putte the punyssement and the
chastisynge and the vengeance of this outrage in the wyl  
<span id="an_1815A"></span> of me and of my wyf Prudence, or ye wol
nat?"  
<span id="an_1816"></span> Thanne the wiseste of hem thre answerde for
hem alle and seyde,  
<span id="an_1817"></span> "Sire," quod he, "we knowen wel that we been
unworthy to comen unto the court  
<span id="an_1817A"></span> of so greet a lord and so worthy as ye

<span id="an_1818"></span> For we han so greetly mystaken us, and han
offended  
<span id="an_1818A"></span> and agilt in swich a wise agayn youre heigh
lordshipe  
<span id="an_1819"></span> that trewely we han disserved the deeth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1820">1820</span></span> But yet,
for the grete goodnesse and debonairetee that al the world witnesseth of
youre persone,  
<span id="an_1821"></span> we submytten us to the excellence and
benignitee of youre gracious lordshipe,  
<span id="an_1822"></span> and been redy to obeie to alle youre
comandementz,  
<span id="an_1823"></span> bisekynge yow that of youre merciable pitee
ye wol considere oure grete repentaunce and lowe submyssioun  
<span id="an_1824"></span> and graunten us foryevenesse of oure
outrageous trespas and offense.  
<span id="an_1825"></span> For wel we knowe that youre liberal grace and
mercy  
<span id="an_1825A"></span> strecchen hem ferther into goodnesse than
doon oure outrageouse giltes and trespas into wikkednesse,  
<span id="an_1826"></span> al be it that cursedly and dampnablely we han
agilt agayn youre heigh lordshipe."  
<span id="an_1827"></span> Thanne Melibee took hem up fro the ground ful
benignely,  
<span id="an_1828"></span> and receyved hire obligaciouns and hir
boondes by hire othes upon hire plegges and borwes,  
<span id="an_1829"></span> and assigned hem a certeyn day to retourne
unto his court  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1830">1830</span></span> for to
accepte and receyve the sentence and juggement that Melibee wolde
comande  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1830A">1830A</span></span> to be
doon on hem by the causes aforeseyd.  
<span id="an_1831"></span> Whiche thynges ordeyned, every man retourned
to his hous.  
<span id="an_1832"></span> And whan that dame Prudence saugh hir tyme,
she freyned and axed hir lord Melibee  
<span id="an_1833"></span> what vengeance he thoughte to taken of his
adversaries.  
<span id="an_1834"></span> To which Melibee answerde and seyde,
"Certes," quod he, "I thynke and purpose me fully  
<span id="an_1835"></span> to desherite hem of al that evere they han
and for to putte hem in exil for evere."  
<span id="an_1836"></span> "Certes," quod dame Prudence, "this were a
crueel sentence and muchel agayn resoun.  
<span id="an_1837"></span> For ye been riche ynough and han no nede of
oother mennes good,  
<span id="an_1838"></span> and ye myghte lightly in this wise gete yow a
coveitous name,  
<span id="an_1839"></span> which is a vicious thyng, and oghte been
eschued of every good man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1840">1840</span></span> For after
the sawe of the word of the Apostle, \`Coveitise is roote of alle
harmes.'  
<span id="an_1841"></span> And therfore it were bettre for yow to lese
so muchel good of youre owene  
<span id="an_1841A"></span> than for to taken of hir good in this
manere,  
<span id="an_1842"></span> for bettre it is to lesen good with worshipe
than it is to wynne good with vileynye and shame.  
<span id="an_1843"></span> And everi man oghte to doon his diligence and
his bisynesse to geten hym a good name.  
<span id="an_1844"></span> And yet shal he nat oonly bisie hym in
kepynge of his good name,  
<span id="an_1845"></span> but he shal also enforcen hym alwey to do
somthyng by which he may renovelle his good name.  
<span id="an_1846"></span> For it is writen that \`the olde good loos or
good name of a man is soone goon  
<span id="an_1846A"></span> and passed, whan it is nat newed ne
renovelled.'  
<span id="an_1847"></span> And as touchynge that ye seyn ye wole exile
youre adversaries,  
<span id="an_1848"></span> that thynketh me muchel agayn resoun and out
of mesure,  
<span id="an_1849"></span> considered the power that they han yeve yow
upon hemself.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1850">1850</span></span> And it is
writen that \`he is worthy to lesen his privilege that mysuseth  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1850A">1850A</span></span> the myght
and the power that is yeven hym.'  
<span id="an_1851"></span> And I sette cas ye myghte enjoyne hem that
peyne by right and by lawe,  
<span id="an_1852"></span> which I trowe ye mowe nat do;  
<span id="an_1853"></span> I seye ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun
peraventure,  
<span id="an_1854"></span> and thanne were it likly to retourne to the
werre as it was biforn.  
<span id="an_1855"></span> And therfore, if ye wole that men do yow
obeisance, ye moste deemen moore curteisly;  
<span id="an_1856"></span> this is to seyn, ye moste yeven moore esy
sentences and juggementz.  
<span id="an_1857"></span> For it is writen that \`he that moost
curteisly comandeth, to hym men moost obeyen.'  
<span id="an_1858"></span> And therfore I prey yow that in this
necessitee and in this nede  
<span id="an_1858A"></span> ye caste yow to overcome youre herte.  
<span id="an_1859"></span> For Senec seith that \`he that overcometh his
herte overcometh twies.'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1860">1860</span></span> And Tullius
seith, \`Ther is no thyng so comendable in a greet lord  
<span id="an_1861"></span> as whan he is debonaire and meeke, and
appeseth him lightly.'  
<span id="an_1862"></span> And I prey yow that ye wole forbere now to do
vengeance,  
<span id="an_1863"></span> in swich a manere that youre goode name may
be kept and conserved,  
<span id="an_1864"></span> and that men mowe have cause and mateere to
preyse yow of pitee and of mercy,  
<span id="an_1865"></span> and that ye have no cause to repente yow of
thyng that ye doon.  
<span id="an_1866"></span> For Senec seith, \`He overcometh in an yvel
manere that repenteth hym of his victorie.'  
<span id="an_1867"></span> Wherfore I pray yow, lat mercy been in youre
herte,  
<span id="an_1868"></span> to th' effect and entente that God Almighty
have mercy on yow in his laste juggement.  
<span id="an_1869"></span> For Seint Jame seith in his Epistle:
\`Juggement withouten mercy shal be doon  
<span id="an_1869A"></span> to hym that hath no mercy of another
wight.'"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1870">1870</span></span> Whanne
Melibee hadde herd the grete skiles and resouns of dame Prudence, and
hire wise informaciouns and techynges,  
<span id="an_1871"></span> his herte gan enclyne to the wil of his wif,
considerynge hir trewe entente,  
<span id="an_1872"></span> and conformed hym anon and assented fully to
werken after hir conseil,  
<span id="an_1873"></span> and thonked God, of whom procedeth al vertu
and alle goodnesse,  
<span id="an_1873A"></span> that hym sente a wyf of so greet
discrecioun.  
<span id="an_1874"></span> And whan the day cam that his adversaries
sholde appieren in his presence,  
<span id="an_1875"></span> he spak unto hem ful goodly, and seyde in
this wyse:  
<span id="an_1876"></span> "Al be it so that of youre pride and heigh
presumpcioun and folie, and of youre necligence and unkonnynge,  
<span id="an_1877"></span> ye have mysborn yow and trespassed unto me,  
<span id="an_1878"></span> yet for as muche as I see and biholde youre
grete humylitee  
<span id="an_1879"></span> and that ye been sory and repentant of youre
giltes,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1880">1880</span></span> it
constreyneth me to doon yow grace and mercy.  
<span id="an_1881"></span> Wherfore I receyve yow to my grace  
<span id="an_1882"></span> and foryeve yow outrely alle the offenses,
injuries, and wronges that ye have doon agayn me and myne,  
<span id="an_1883"></span> to this effect and to this ende, that God of
his endelees mercy  
<span id="an_1884"></span> wole at the tyme of oure diynge foryeven us
oure giltes  
<span id="an_1884A"></span> that we han trespassed to hym in this
wrecched world.  
<span id="an_1885"></span> For doutelees, if we be sory and repentant of
the synnes and giltes which we han trespassed  
<span id="an_1885A"></span> in the sighte of oure Lord God,  
<span id="an_1886"></span> he is so free and so merciable  
<span id="an_1887"></span> that he wole foryeven us oure giltes  
<span id="an_1888"></span> and bryngen us to the blisse that nevere hath
ende." Amen.
