#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Shipman's Tale

<span id="an_1"></span> A marchant whilom dwelled at Seint-Denys,  
<span id="an_2"></span> That riche was, for which men helde hym wys.  
<span id="an_3"></span> A wyf he hadde of excellent beautee;  
<span id="an_4"></span> And compaignable and revelous was she,  
<span id="an_5"></span> Which is a thyng that causeth more dispence  
<span id="an_6"></span> Than worth is al the chiere and reverence  
<span id="an_7"></span> That men hem doon at festes and at daunces.  
<span id="an_8"></span> Swiche salutaciouns and contenaunces  
<span id="an_9"></span> Passen as dooth a shadwe upon the wal;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_10">10</span></span> But wo is hym
that payen moot for al!  
<span id="an_11"></span> The sely housbonde, algate he moot paye,  
<span id="an_12"></span> He moot us clothe, and he moot us arraye,  
<span id="an_13"></span> Al for his owene worshipe richely,  
<span id="an_14"></span> In which array we daunce jolily.  
<span id="an_15"></span> And if that he noght may, par aventure,  
<span id="an_16"></span> Or ellis list no swich dispence endure,  
<span id="an_17"></span> But thynketh it is wasted and ylost,  
<span id="an_18"></span> Thanne moot another payen for oure cost,  
<span id="an_19"></span> Or lene us gold, and that is perilous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_20">20</span></span> This noble
marchaunt heeld a worthy hous,  
<span id="an_21"></span> For which he hadde alday so greet repair  
<span id="an_22"></span> For his largesse, and for his wyf was fair,  
<span id="an_23"></span> That wonder is; but herkneth to my tale.  
<span id="an_24"></span> Amonges alle his gestes, grete and smale,  
<span id="an_25"></span> Ther was a monk, a fair man and a boold --  
<span id="an_26"></span> I trowe a thritty wynter he was oold --  
<span id="an_27"></span> That evere in oon was drawynge to that place.  
<span id="an_28"></span> This yonge monk, that was so fair of face,  
<span id="an_29"></span> Aqueynted was so with the goode man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span> Sith that hir
firste knoweliche bigan,  
<span id="an_31"></span> That in his hous as famulier was he  
<span id="an_32"></span> As it is possible any freend to be.  
<span id="an_33"></span> And for as muchel as this goode man,  
<span id="an_34"></span> And eek this monk of which that I bigan,  
<span id="an_35"></span> Were bothe two yborn in o village,  
<span id="an_36"></span> The monk hym claymeth as for cosynage,  
<span id="an_37"></span> And he agayn; he seith nat ones nay,  
<span id="an_38"></span> But was as glad therof as fowel of day,  
<span id="an_39"></span> For to his herte it was a greet plesaunce.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span> Thus been they
knyt with eterne alliaunce,  
<span id="an_41"></span> And ech of hem gan oother for t' assure  
<span id="an_42"></span> Of bretherhede whil that hir lyf may dure.  
<span id="an_43"></span> Free was daun John, and manly of dispence,  
<span id="an_44"></span> As in that hous, and ful of diligence  
<span id="an_45"></span> To doon plesaunce, and also greet costage.  
<span id="an_46"></span> He noght forgat to yeve the leeste page  
<span id="an_47"></span> In al that hous; but after hir degree,  
<span id="an_48"></span> He yaf the lord, and sitthe al his meynee,  
<span id="an_49"></span> Whan that he cam, som manere honest thyng,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span> For which they
were as glad of his comyng  
<span id="an_51"></span> As fowel is fayn whan that the sonne up
riseth.  
<span id="an_52"></span> Na moore of this as now, for it suffiseth.  
<span id="an_53"></span> But so bifel, this marchant on a day  
<span id="an_54"></span> Shoop hym to make redy his array  
<span id="an_55"></span> Toward the toun of Brugges for to fare,  
<span id="an_56"></span> To byen there a porcioun of ware;  
<span id="an_57"></span> For which he hath to Parys sent anon  
<span id="an_58"></span> A messager, and preyed hath daun John  
<span id="an_59"></span> That he sholde come to Seint-Denys to pleye  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60">60</span></span> With hym and
with his wyf a day or tweye,  
<span id="an_61"></span> Er he to Brugges wente, in alle wise.  
<span id="an_62"></span> This noble monk, of which I yow devyse,  
<span id="an_63"></span> Hath of his abbot, as hym list, licence,  
<span id="an_64"></span> By cause he was a man of heigh prudence  
<span id="an_65"></span> And eek an officer, out for to ryde,  
<span id="an_66"></span> To seen hir graunges and hire bernes wyde,  
<span id="an_67"></span> And unto Seint-Denys he comth anon.  
<span id="an_68"></span> Who was so welcome as my lord daun John,  
<span id="an_69"></span> Oure deere cosyn, ful of curteisye?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_70">70</span></span> With hym
broghte he a jubbe of malvesye,  
<span id="an_71"></span> And eek another ful of fyn vernage,  
<span id="an_72"></span> And volatyl, as ay was his usage.  
<span id="an_73"></span> And thus I lete hem ete and drynke and pleye,  
<span id="an_74"></span> This marchant and this monk, a day or tweye.  
<span id="an_75"></span> The thridde day, this marchant up ariseth,  
<span id="an_76"></span> And on his nedes sadly hym avyseth,  
<span id="an_77"></span> And up into his countour-hous gooth he  
<span id="an_78"></span> To rekene with hymself, wel may be,  
<span id="an_79"></span> Of thilke yeer how that it with hym stood,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span> And how that he
despended hadde his good,  
<span id="an_81"></span> And if that he encressed were or noon.  
<span id="an_82"></span> His bookes and his bagges many oon  
<span id="an_83"></span> He leith biforn hym on his countyng-bord.  
<span id="an_84"></span> Ful riche was his tresor and his hord,  
<span id="an_85"></span> For which ful faste his countour-dore he
shette;  
<span id="an_86"></span> And eek he nolde that no man sholde hym lette  
<span id="an_87"></span> Of his acountes, for the meene tyme;  
<span id="an_88"></span> And thus he sit til it was passed pryme.  
<span id="an_89"></span> Daun John was rysen in the morwe also,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span> And in the
gardyn walketh to and fro,  
<span id="an_91"></span> And hath his thynges seyd ful curteisly.  
<span id="an_92"></span> This goode wyf cam walkynge pryvely  
<span id="an_93"></span> Into the gardyn, there he walketh softe,  
<span id="an_94"></span> And hym saleweth, as she hath doon ofte.  
<span id="an_95"></span> A mayde child cam in hire compaignye,  
<span id="an_96"></span> Which as hir list she may governe and gye,  
<span id="an_97"></span> For yet under the yerde was the mayde.  
<span id="an_98"></span> "O deere cosyn myn, daun John," she sayde,  
<span id="an_99"></span> "What eyleth yow so rathe for to ryse?"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span> "Nece," quod
he, "it oghte ynough suffise  
<span id="an_101"></span> Fyve houres for to slepe upon a nyght,  
<span id="an_102"></span> But it were for an old appalled wight,  
<span id="an_103"></span> As been thise wedded men, that lye and dare  
<span id="an_104"></span> As in a fourme sit a wery hare,  
<span id="an_105"></span> Were al forstraught with houndes grete and
smale.  
<span id="an_106"></span> But deere nece, why be ye so pale?  
<span id="an_107"></span> I trowe, certes, that oure goode man  
<span id="an_108"></span> Hath yow laboured sith the nyght bigan  
<span id="an_109"></span> That yow were nede to resten hastily."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110">110</span></span> And with that
word he lough ful murily,  
<span id="an_111"></span> And of his owene thought he wax al reed.

<span id="an_114"></span> "Nay, cosyn myn, it stant nat so with me;  
<span id="an_115"></span> For, by that God that yaf me soule and lyf,  
<span id="an_116"></span> In al the reawme of France is ther no wyf  
<span id="an_117"></span> That lasse lust hath to that sory pley.  
<span id="an_118"></span> For I may synge \`allas and weylawey

<span id="an_193"></span> And but I do, God take on me vengeance  
<span id="an_194"></span> As foul as evere hadde Genylon of France."

<span id="an_268"></span> It shal be doon right as ye wol devyse.  
<span id="an_269"></span> "O thyng, er that ye goon, if it may be,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_270">270</span></span> I wolde prey
yow: for to lene me  
<span id="an_271"></span> An hundred frankes, for a wyke or tweye,  
<span id="an_272"></span> For certein beestes that I moste beye,  
<span id="an_273"></span> To stoore with a place that is oures.  
<span id="an_274"></span> God helpe me so, I wolde it were youres!  
<span id="an_275"></span> I shal nat faille surely of my day,  
<span id="an_276"></span> Nat for a thousand frankes, a mile way.  
<span id="an_277"></span> But lat this thyng be secree, I yow preye,  
<span id="an_278"></span> For yet to-nyght thise beestes moot I beye.  
<span id="an_279"></span> And fare now wel, myn owene cosyn deere;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_280">280</span></span> Graunt mercy
of youre cost and of youre cheere."  
<span id="an_281"></span> This noble marchant gentilly anon  
<span id="an_282"></span> Answerde and seyde, "O cosyn myn, daun John,  
<span id="an_283"></span> Now sikerly this is a smal requeste.  
<span id="an_284"></span> My gold is youres, whan that it yow leste,  
<span id="an_285"></span> And nat oonly my gold, but my chaffare.  
<span id="an_286"></span> Take what yow list; God shilde that ye
spare.  
<span id="an_287"></span> "But o thyng is, ye knowe it wel ynogh  
<span id="an_288"></span> Of chapmen, that hir moneie is hir plogh.  
<span id="an_289"></span> We may creaunce whil we have a name,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_290">290</span></span> But goldlees
for to be, it is no game.  
<span id="an_291"></span> Paye it agayn whan it lith in youre ese;  
<span id="an_292"></span> After my myght ful fayn wolde I yow plese."  
<span id="an_293"></span> Thise hundred frankes he fette forth anon,  
<span id="an_294"></span> And prively he took hem to daun John.  
<span id="an_295"></span> No wight in al this world wiste of this
loone  
<span id="an_296"></span> Savynge this marchant and daun John allone.  
<span id="an_297"></span> They drynke, and speke, and rome a while and
pleye,  
<span id="an_298"></span> Til that daun John rideth to his abbeye.  
<span id="an_299"></span> The morwe cam, and forth this marchant
rideth  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_300">300</span></span> To
Flaundres-ward; his prentys wel hym gydeth  
<span id="an_301"></span> Til he came into Brugges murily.  
<span id="an_302"></span> Now gooth this marchant faste and bisily  
<span id="an_303"></span> Aboute his nede, and byeth and creaunceth.  
<span id="an_304"></span> He neither pleyeth at the dees ne daunceth,  
<span id="an_305"></span> But as a marchaunt, shortly for to telle,  
<span id="an_306"></span> He let his lyf, and there I lete hym dwelle.  
<span id="an_307"></span> The Sonday next the marchant was agon,  
<span id="an_308"></span> To Seint-Denys ycomen is daun John,  
<span id="an_309"></span> With crowne and berd al fressh and newe
yshave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_310">310</span></span> In al the
hous ther nas so litel a knave,  
<span id="an_311"></span> Ne no wight elles, that he nas ful fayn  
<span id="an_312"></span> That my lord daun John was come agayn.  
<span id="an_313"></span> And shortly to the point right for to gon,  
<span id="an_314"></span> This faire wyf acorded with daun John  
<span id="an_315"></span> That for thise hundred frankes he sholde al
nyght  
<span id="an_316"></span> Have hire in his armes bolt upright;  
<span id="an_317"></span> And this acord parfourned was in dede.  
<span id="an_318"></span> In myrthe al nyght a bisy lyf they lede  
<span id="an_319"></span> Til it was day, that daun John wente his
way,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_320">320</span></span> And bad the
meynee "Farewel, have good day!"  
<span id="an_321"></span> For noon of hem, ne no wight in the toun,  
<span id="an_322"></span> Hath of daun John right no suspecioun.  
<span id="an_323"></span> And forth he rydeth hoom to his abbeye,  
<span id="an_324"></span> Or where hym list; namoore of hym I seye.  
<span id="an_325"></span> This marchant, whan that ended was the
faire,  
<span id="an_326"></span> To Seint-Denys he gan for to repaire,  
<span id="an_327"></span> And with his wyf he maketh feeste and
cheere,  
<span id="an_328"></span> And telleth hire that chaffare is so deere  
<span id="an_329"></span> That nedes moste he make a chevyssaunce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_330">330</span></span> For he was
bounden in a reconyssaunce  
<span id="an_331"></span> To paye twenty thousand sheeld anon.  
<span id="an_332"></span> For which this marchant is to Parys gon  
<span id="an_333"></span> To borwe of certeine freendes that he hadde  
<span id="an_334"></span> A certeyn frankes; and somme with him he
ladde.  
<span id="an_335"></span> And whan that he was come into the toun,  
<span id="an_336"></span> For greet chiertee and greet affeccioun,  
<span id="an_337"></span> Unto daun John he first gooth hym to pleye;  
<span id="an_338"></span> Nat for to axe or borwe of hym moneye,  
<span id="an_339"></span> But for to wite and seen of his welfare,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_340">340</span></span> And for to
tellen hym of his chaffare,  
<span id="an_341"></span> As freendes doon whan they been met yfeere.  
<span id="an_342"></span> Daun John hym maketh feeste and murye
cheere,  
<span id="an_343"></span> And he hym tolde agayn, ful specially,  
<span id="an_344"></span> How he hadde wel yboght and graciously,  
<span id="an_345"></span> Thanked be God, al hool his marchandise,  
<span id="an_346"></span> Save that he moste, in alle maner wise,  
<span id="an_347"></span> Maken a chevyssaunce, as for his beste,  
<span id="an_348"></span> And thanne he sholde been in joye and reste.  
<span id="an_349"></span> Daun John answerde, "Certes, I am fayn  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_350">350</span></span> That ye in
heele ar comen hom agayn.  
<span id="an_351"></span> And if that I were riche, as have I blisse,  
<span id="an_352"></span> Of twenty thousand sheeld sholde ye nat
mysse,  
<span id="an_353"></span> For ye so kyndely this oother day  
<span id="an_354"></span> Lente me gold; and as I kan and may,  
<span id="an_355"></span> I thanke yow, by God and by Seint Jame!  
<span id="an_356"></span> But nathelees, I took unto oure dame,  
<span id="an_357"></span> Youre wyf, at hom, the same gold ageyn  
<span id="an_358"></span> Upon youre bench; she woot it wel, certeyn,  
<span id="an_359"></span> By certeyn tokenes that I kan hire telle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_360">360</span></span> Now, by youre

<span id="an_361"></span> Oure abbot wole out of this toun anon,  
<span id="an_362"></span> And in his compaignye moot I goon.  
<span id="an_363"></span> Grete wel oure dame, myn owene nece sweete,  
<span id="an_364"></span> And fare wel, deere cosyn, til we meete!"  
<span id="an_365"></span> This marchant, which that was ful war and
wys,  
<span id="an_366"></span> Creanced hath, and payd eek in Parys  
<span id="an_367"></span> To certeyn Lumbardes, redy in hir hond,  
<span id="an_368"></span> The somme of gold, and gat of hem his bond;  
<span id="an_369"></span> And hoom he gooth, murie as a papejay,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_370">370</span></span> For wel he
knew he stood in swich array  
<span id="an_371"></span> That nedes moste he wynne in that viage  
<span id="an_372"></span> A thousand frankes aboven al his costage.  
<span id="an_373"></span> His wyf ful redy mette hym atte gate,  
<span id="an_374"></span> As she was wont of oold usage algate,  
<span id="an_375"></span> And al that nyght in myrthe they bisette;  
<span id="an_376"></span> For he was riche and cleerly out of dette.  
<span id="an_377"></span> Whan it was day, this marchant gan embrace  
<span id="an_378"></span> His wyf al newe, and kiste hire on hir face,  
<span id="an_379"></span> And up he gooth and maketh it ful tough.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_380">380</span></span> "Namoore,"
quod she, "by God, ye have ynough!"  
<span id="an_381"></span> And wantownly agayn with hym she pleyde  
<span id="an_382"></span> Til atte laste thus this marchant seyde:  
<span id="an_383"></span> "By God," quod he, "I am a litel wrooth  
<span id="an_384"></span> With yow, my wyf, although it be me looth.  
<span id="an_385"></span> And woot ye why? By God, as that I gesse  
<span id="an_386"></span> That ye han maad a manere straungenesse  
<span id="an_387"></span> Bitwixen me and my cosyn daun John.  
<span id="an_388"></span> Ye sholde han warned me, er I had gon,  
<span id="an_389"></span> That he yow hadde an hundred frankes payed  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_390">390</span></span> By redy
token; and heeld hym yvele apayed,  
<span id="an_391"></span> For that I to hym spak of chevyssaunce;  
<span id="an_392"></span> Me semed so, as by his contenaunce.  
<span id="an_393"></span> But nathelees, by God, oure hevene kyng,  
<span id="an_394"></span> I thoughte nat to axen hym no thyng.  
<span id="an_395"></span> I prey thee, wyf, ne do namoore so;  
<span id="an_396"></span> Telle me alwey, er that I fro thee go,  
<span id="an_397"></span> If any dettour hath in myn absence  
<span id="an_398"></span> Ypayed thee, lest thurgh thy necligence  
<span id="an_399"></span> I myghte hym axe a thing that he hath
payed."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_400">400</span></span> This wyf was
nat afered nor affrayed,  
<span id="an_401"></span> But boldely she seyde, and that anon,  
<span id="an_402"></span> "Marie, I deffie the false monk, daun John!  
<span id="an_403"></span> I kepe nat of his tokenes never a deel;  
<span id="an_404"></span> He took me certeyn gold, that woot I weel --  
<span id="an_405"></span> What! Yvel thedam on his monkes snowte!  
<span id="an_406"></span> For, God it woot, I wende, withouten doute,  
<span id="an_407"></span> That he hadde yeve it me bycause of yow  
<span id="an_408"></span> To doon therwith myn honour and my prow,

<span id="an_427"></span> This marchant saugh ther was no remedie,  
<span id="an_428"></span> And for to chide it nere but folie,  
<span id="an_429"></span> Sith that the thyng may nat amended be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_430">430</span></span> "Now wyf," he
seyde, "and I foryeve it thee;  
<span id="an_431"></span> But, by thy lyf, ne be namoore so large.  
<span id="an_432"></span> Keep bet thy good, this yeve I thee in

<span id="an_433"></span> Thus endeth my tale, and God us sende
