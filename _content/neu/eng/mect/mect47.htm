That oon of hem is solempne, another is commune, and the thridde is privee.<br> <A NAME="an_103"></A>&nbsp;Thilke penance that is solempne is in two maneres;<br> <A NAME="an_103A"></A>&nbsp;as to be put out of hooly chirche in Lente for slaughtre of children, and swich maner thyng.<br> <A NAME="an_104"></A>&nbsp;Another is, whan a man hath synned openly, of which synne the fame is openly spoken in the contree,<br> <A NAME="an_104A"></A>&nbsp;and thanne hooly chirche by juggement destreyneth hym for to do open penaunce.<br> <A NAME="an_105"></A>&nbsp;Commune penaunce is that preestes enjoynen men communly in certeyn caas, as for to goon peraventure naked in pilgrimages, or barefoot.<br> <A NAME="an_106"></A>&nbsp;Pryvee penaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee synnes, of whiche we shryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce.<br> <A NAME="an_107"></A>&nbsp;Now shaltow understande what is bihovely and necessarie to verray parfit Penitence.

Soothly synnes been the weyes that leden folk to helle.<br> <A NAME="an_142"></A>&nbsp;The seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of synne is this:<br> <A NAME="an_142A"></A>&nbsp;that, as seith Seint Peter, "whoso that dooth synne is thral of synne"; and synne put a man in greet thraldom.<br> <A NAME="an_143"></A>&nbsp;And therfore seith the prophete Ezechiel: "I wente sorweful in desdayn of myself."<br> <A NAME="an_143A"></A>&nbsp;Certes, wel oghte a man have desdayn of synne and withdrawe hym from that thraldom and vileynye.<br> <A NAME="an_144"></A>&nbsp;And lo, what seith Seneca in this matere? He seith thus: "Though I wiste that neither God ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it,<br> <A NAME="an_144A"></A>&nbsp;yet wolde I have desdayn for to do synne."<br> <A NAME="an_145"></A>&nbsp;And the same Seneca also seith, "I am born to gretter thynges than to be thral to my body,<br> <A NAME="an_145A"></A>&nbsp;or than for to maken of my body a thral."<br> <A NAME="an_146"></A>&nbsp;Ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken of his body than for to yeven his body to synne.<br> <A NAME="an_147"></A>&nbsp;Al were it the fouleste cherl or the fouleste womman that lyveth, and leest of value,<br> <A NAME="an_147A"></A>&nbsp;yet is he thanne moore foul and moore in servitute.<br> <A NAME="an_148"></A>&nbsp;Evere fro the hyer degree that man falleth, the moore is he thral, and moore to God and to the world vile and abhomynable.<br> <A NAME="an_149"></A>&nbsp;O goode God, wel oghte man have desdayn of synne, sith that thurgh synne ther he was free now is he maked bonde.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_150">150</A></FONT></span>&nbsp;And therfore seyth Seint Augustyn: "If thou hast desdayn of thy servant,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_150A">150A</A></FONT></span>&nbsp;if he agilte or synne, have thou thanne desdayn that thou thyself sholdest do synne."<br> <A NAME="an_151"></A>&nbsp;Tak reward of thy value, that thou ne be to foul to thyself.<br> <A NAME="an_152"></A>&nbsp;Allas, wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles to synne, and soore been ashamed of hemself<br> <A NAME="an_153"></A>&nbsp;that God of his endelees goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat, or yeven hem wit, strengthe of body, heele, beautee, prosperitee,<br> <A NAME="an_154"></A>&nbsp;and boghte hem fro the deeth with his herte-blood,<br> <A NAME="an_154A"></A>&nbsp;that they so unkyndely, agayns his gentilesse, quiten hym so vileynsly to slaughtre of hir owene soules.<br> <A NAME="an_155"></A>&nbsp;O goode God, ye wommen that been of so greet beautee, remembreth yow of the proverbe of Salomon.
