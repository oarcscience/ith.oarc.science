#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Knight's Tale

<span id="an_859"></span> Whilom, as olde stories tellen us,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_860">860</span></span> Ther was a
duc that highte Theseus;  
<span id="an_861"></span> Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,  
<span id="an_862"></span> And in his tyme swich a conquerour  
<span id="an_863"></span> That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.  
<span id="an_864"></span> Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;  
<span id="an_865"></span> What with his wysdom and his chivalrie,  
<span id="an_866"></span> He conquered al the regne of Femenye,  
<span id="an_867"></span> That whilom was ycleped Scithia,  
<span id="an_868"></span> And weddede the queene Ypolita,  
<span id="an_869"></span> And broghte hire hoom with hym in his
contree  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870">870</span></span> With muchel
glorie and greet solempnytee,  
<span id="an_871"></span> And eek hir yonge suster Emelye.  
<span id="an_872"></span> And thus with victorie and with melodye  
<span id="an_873"></span> Lete I this noble duc to Atthenes ryde,  
<span id="an_874"></span> And al his hoost in armes hym bisyde.  
<span id="an_875"></span> And certes, if it nere to long to heere,  
<span id="an_876"></span> I wolde have toold yow fully the manere  
<span id="an_877"></span> How wonnen was the regne of Femenye  
<span id="an_878"></span> By Theseus and by his chivalrye;  
<span id="an_879"></span> And of the grete bataille for the nones  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> Bitwixen
Atthenes and Amazones;  
<span id="an_881"></span> And how asseged was Ypolita,  
<span id="an_882"></span> The faire, hardy queene of Scithia;  
<span id="an_883"></span> And of the feste that was at hir weddynge,  
<span id="an_884"></span> And of the tempest at hir hoom-comynge;  
<span id="an_885"></span> But al that thyng I moot as now forbere.  
<span id="an_886"></span> I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere,  
<span id="an_887"></span> And wayke been the oxen in my plough.  
<span id="an_888"></span> The remenant of the tale is long ynough.  
<span id="an_889"></span> I wol nat letten eek noon of this route;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_890">890</span></span> Lat every
felawe telle his tale aboute,  
<span id="an_891"></span> And lat se now who shal the soper wynne;  
<span id="an_892"></span> And ther I lefte, I wol ayeyn bigynne.  
<span id="an_893"></span> This duc, of whom I make mencioun,  
<span id="an_894"></span> Whan he was come almoost unto the toun,  
<span id="an_895"></span> In al his wele and in his mooste pride,  
<span id="an_896"></span> He was war, as he caste his eye aside,  
<span id="an_897"></span> Where that ther kneled in the heighe weye  
<span id="an_898"></span> A compaignye of ladyes, tweye and tweye,  
<span id="an_899"></span> Ech after oother clad in clothes blake;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900">900</span></span> But swich a
cry and swich a wo they make  
<span id="an_901"></span> That in this world nys creature lyvynge  
<span id="an_902"></span> That herde swich another waymentynge;  
<span id="an_903"></span> And of this cry they nolde nevere stenten  
<span id="an_904"></span> Til they the reynes of his brydel henten.  
<span id="an_905"></span> "What folk been ye, that at myn hom-comynge  
<span id="an_906"></span> Perturben so my feste with criynge?"  
<span id="an_907"></span> Quod Theseus. "Have ye so greet envye  
<span id="an_908"></span> Of myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye?  
<span id="an_909"></span> Or who hath yow mysboden or offended?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_910">910</span></span> And telleth
me if it may been amended,  
<span id="an_911"></span> And why that ye been clothed thus in blak."  
<span id="an_912"></span> The eldeste lady of hem alle spak,  
<span id="an_913"></span> Whan she hadde swowned with a deedly cheere,  
<span id="an_914"></span> That it was routhe for to seen and heere;  
<span id="an_915"></span> She seyde, "Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven  
<span id="an_916"></span> Victorie, and as a conqueror to lyven,  
<span id="an_917"></span> Nat greveth us youre glorie and youre
honour,  
<span id="an_918"></span> But we biseken mercy and socour.  
<span id="an_919"></span> Have mercy on oure wo and oure distresse!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_920">920</span></span> Som drope of
pitee, thurgh thy gentillesse,  
<span id="an_921"></span> Upon us wrecched wommen lat thou falle,  
<span id="an_922"></span> For, certes, lord, ther is noon of us alle  
<span id="an_923"></span> That she ne hath been a duchesse or a
queene.  
<span id="an_924"></span> Now be we caytyves, as it is wel seene,  
<span id="an_925"></span> Thanked be Fortune and hire false wheel,  
<span id="an_926"></span> That noon estaat assureth to be weel.  
<span id="an_927"></span> And certes, lord, to abyden youre presence,  
<span id="an_928"></span> Heere in this temple of the goddesse
Clemence  
<span id="an_929"></span> We han ben waitynge al this fourtenyght.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_930">930</span></span> Now help us,
lord, sith it is in thy myght.  
<span id="an_931"></span> "I, wrecche, which that wepe and wayle thus,  
<span id="an_932"></span> Was whilom wyf to kyng Cappaneus,  
<span id="an_933"></span> That starf at Thebes -- cursed be that day!
--  
<span id="an_934"></span> And alle we that been in this array  
<span id="an_935"></span> And maken al this lamentacioun,  
<span id="an_936"></span> We losten alle oure housbondes at that toun,  
<span id="an_937"></span> Whil that the seege theraboute lay.  
<span id="an_938"></span> And yet now the olde Creon -- weylaway! --  
<span id="an_939"></span> That lord is now of Thebes the citee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940">940</span></span> Fulfild of
ire and of iniquitee,  
<span id="an_941"></span> He, for despit and for his tirannye,  
<span id="an_942"></span> To do the dede bodyes vileynye  
<span id="an_943"></span> Of alle oure lordes whiche that been yslawe,  
<span id="an_944"></span> Hath alle the bodyes on an heep ydrawe,  
<span id="an_945"></span> And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent,  
<span id="an_946"></span> Neither to been yburyed nor ybrent,  
<span id="an_947"></span> But maketh houndes ete hem in despit."  
<span id="an_948"></span> And with that word, withouten moore respit,  
<span id="an_949"></span> They fillen gruf and criden pitously,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_950">950</span></span> "Have on us
wrecched wommen som mercy,  
<span id="an_951"></span> And lat oure sorwe synken in thyn herte."  
<span id="an_952"></span> This gentil duc doun from his courser sterte  
<span id="an_953"></span> With herte pitous, whan he herde hem speke.  
<span id="an_954"></span> Hym thoughte that his herte wolde breke,  
<span id="an_955"></span> Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so maat,  
<span id="an_956"></span> That whilom weren of so greet estaat;  
<span id="an_957"></span> And in his armes he hem alle up hente,  
<span id="an_958"></span> And hem conforteth in ful good entente,  
<span id="an_959"></span> And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knyght,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_960">960</span></span> He wolde doon
so ferforthly his myght  
<span id="an_961"></span> Upon the tiraunt Creon hem to wreke  
<span id="an_962"></span> That al the peple of Grece sholde speke  
<span id="an_963"></span> How Creon was of Theseus yserved  
<span id="an_964"></span> As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved.  
<span id="an_965"></span> And right anoon, withouten moore abood,  
<span id="an_966"></span> His baner he desplayeth, and forth rood  
<span id="an_967"></span> To Thebes-ward, and al his hoost biside.  
<span id="an_968"></span> No neer Atthenes wolde he go ne ride,  
<span id="an_969"></span> Ne take his ese fully half a day,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970">970</span></span> But onward on
his wey that nyght he lay,  
<span id="an_971"></span> And sente anon Ypolita the queene,  
<span id="an_972"></span> And Emelye, hir yonge suster sheene,  
<span id="an_973"></span> Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle,  
<span id="an_974"></span> And forth he rit; ther is namoore to telle.  
<span id="an_975"></span> The rede statue of Mars, with spere and
targe,  
<span id="an_976"></span> So shyneth in his white baner large  
<span id="an_977"></span> That alle the feeldes glyteren up and doun;  
<span id="an_978"></span> And by his baner born is his penoun  
<span id="an_979"></span> Of gold ful riche, in which ther was ybete  

 

 

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_980">980</span></span> The Mynotaur,
which that he wan in Crete.  
<span id="an_981"></span> Thus rit this duc, thus rit this conquerour,  
<span id="an_982"></span> And in his hoost of chivalrie the flour,  
<span id="an_983"></span> Til that he cam to Thebes and alighte  
<span id="an_984"></span> Faire in a feeld, ther as he thoughte to
fighte.  
<span id="an_985"></span> But shortly for to speken of this thyng,  
<span id="an_986"></span> With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,  
<span id="an_987"></span> He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyght  
<span id="an_988"></span> In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to
flyght;  
<span id="an_989"></span> And by assaut he wan the citee after,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_990">990</span></span> And rente
adoun bothe wall and sparre and rafter;  
<span id="an_991"></span> And to the ladyes he restored agayn  
<span id="an_992"></span> The bones of hir freendes that were slayn,  
<span id="an_993"></span> To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse.  
<span id="an_994"></span> But it were al to longe for to devyse  
<span id="an_995"></span> The grete clamour and the waymentynge  
<span id="an_996"></span> That the ladyes made at the brennynge  
<span id="an_997"></span> Of the bodies, and the grete honour  
<span id="an_998"></span> That Theseus, the noble conquerour,  
<span id="an_999"></span> Dooth to the ladyes, whan they from hym
wente;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000">1000</span></span> But shortly
for to telle is myn entente.  
<span id="an_1001"></span> Whan that this worthy duc, this Theseus,  
<span id="an_1002"></span> Hath Creon slayn and wonne Thebes thus,  
<span id="an_1003"></span> Stille in that feeld he took al nyght his
reste,  
<span id="an_1004"></span> And dide with al the contree as hym leste.  
<span id="an_1005"></span> To ransake in the taas of bodyes dede,  
<span id="an_1006"></span> Hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede,  
<span id="an_1007"></span> The pilours diden bisynesse and cure  
<span id="an_1008"></span> After the bataille and disconfiture.  
<span id="an_1009"></span> And so bifel that in the taas they founde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1010">1010</span></span> Thurgh-girt
with many a grevous blody wounde,  
<span id="an_1011"></span> Two yonge knyghtes liggynge by and by,  
<span id="an_1012"></span> Bothe in oon armes, wroght ful richely,  
<span id="an_1013"></span> Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,  
<span id="an_1014"></span> And that oother knyght highte Palamon.  
<span id="an_1015"></span> Nat fully quyke, ne fully dede they were,  
<span id="an_1016"></span> But by hir cote-armures and by hir gere  
<span id="an_1017"></span> The heraudes knewe hem best in special  
<span id="an_1018"></span> As they that weren of the blood roial  
<span id="an_1019"></span> Of Thebes, and of sustren two yborn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1020">1020</span></span> Out of the
taas the pilours han hem torn,  
<span id="an_1021"></span> And han hem caried softe unto the tente  
<span id="an_1022"></span> Of Theseus; and he ful soone hem sente  
<span id="an_1023"></span> To Atthenes, to dwellen in prisoun  
<span id="an_1024"></span> Perpetuelly -- he nolde no raunsoun.  
<span id="an_1025"></span> And whan this worthy duc hath thus ydon,  
<span id="an_1026"></span> He took his hoost, and hoom he rit anon  
<span id="an_1027"></span> With laurer crowned as a conquerour;  
<span id="an_1028"></span> And ther he lyveth in joye and in honour  
<span id="an_1029"></span> Terme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1030">1030</span></span> And in a
tour, in angwissh and in wo,  
<span id="an_1031"></span> This Palamon and his felawe Arcite  
<span id="an_1032"></span> For everemoore; ther may no gold hem quite.  
<span id="an_1033"></span> This passeth yeer by yeer and day by day,  
<span id="an_1034"></span> Till it fil ones, in a morwe of May,  
<span id="an_1035"></span> That Emelye, that fairer was to sene  
<span id="an_1036"></span> Than is the lylie upon his stalke grene,  
<span id="an_1037"></span> And fressher than the May with floures newe
--  
<span id="an_1038"></span> For with the rose colour stroof hire hewe,  
<span id="an_1039"></span> I noot which was the fyner of hem two --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1040">1040</span></span> Er it were
day, as was hir wone to do,  
<span id="an_1041"></span> She was arisen and al redy dight,  
<span id="an_1042"></span> For May wole have no slogardie anyght.  
<span id="an_1043"></span> The sesoun priketh every gentil herte,  
<span id="an_1044"></span> And maketh it out of his slep to sterte,  
<span id="an_1045"></span> And seith "Arys, and do thyn observaunce."  
<span id="an_1046"></span> This maked Emelye have remembraunce  
<span id="an_1047"></span> To doon honour to May, and for to ryse.  
<span id="an_1048"></span> Yclothed was she fressh, for to devyse:  
<span id="an_1049"></span> Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1050">1050</span></span> Bihynde hir
bak, a yerde long, I gesse.  
<span id="an_1051"></span> And in the gardyn, at the sonne upriste,  
<span id="an_1052"></span> She walketh up and doun, and as hire liste  
<span id="an_1053"></span> She gadereth floures, party white and rede,  
<span id="an_1054"></span> To make a subtil gerland for hire hede;  
<span id="an_1055"></span> And as an aungel hevenysshly she soong.  
<span id="an_1056"></span> The grete tour, that was so thikke and
stroong,  
<span id="an_1057"></span> Which of the castel was the chief dongeoun  
<span id="an_1058"></span> (Ther as the knyghtes weren in prisoun  
<span id="an_1059"></span> Of which I tolde yow and tellen shal),  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1060">1060</span></span> Was evene
joynant to the gardyn wal  
<span id="an_1061"></span> Ther as this Emelye hadde hir pleyynge.  
<span id="an_1062"></span> Bright was the sonne and cleer that
morwenynge,  
<span id="an_1063"></span> And Palamoun, this woful prisoner,  
<span id="an_1064"></span> As was his wone, by leve of his gayler,  
<span id="an_1065"></span> Was risen and romed in a chambre an heigh,  
<span id="an_1066"></span> In which he al the noble citee seigh,  
<span id="an_1067"></span> And eek the gardyn, ful of braunches grene,  
<span id="an_1068"></span> Ther as this fresshe Emelye the shene  
<span id="an_1069"></span> Was in hire walk, and romed up and doun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1070">1070</span></span> This
sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,  
<span id="an_1071"></span> Goth in the chambre romynge to and fro  
<span id="an_1072"></span> And to hymself compleynynge of his wo.  
<span id="an_1073"></span> That he was born, ful ofte he seyde,
"allas!"  
<span id="an_1074"></span> And so bifel, by aventure or cas,  
<span id="an_1075"></span> That thurgh a wyndow, thikke of many a
barre  
<span id="an_1076"></span> Of iren greet and square as any sparre,  
<span id="an_1077"></span> He cast his eye upon Emelya,  
<span id="an_1078"></span> And therwithal he bleynte and cride, "A!"  
<span id="an_1079"></span> As though he stongen were unto the herte.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1080">1080</span></span> And with
that cry Arcite anon up sterte  
<span id="an_1081"></span> And seyde, "Cosyn myn, what eyleth thee,  
<span id="an_1082"></span> That art so pale and deedly on to see?  
<span id="an_1083"></span> Why cridestow? Who hath thee doon offence?  
<span id="an_1084"></span> For Goddes love, taak al in pacience  
<span id="an_1085"></span> Oure prisoun, for it may noon oother be.  
<span id="an_1086"></span> Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee.  
<span id="an_1087"></span> Som wikke aspect or disposicioun  
<span id="an_1088"></span> Of Saturne, by som constellacioun,  
<span id="an_1089"></span> Hath yeven us this, although we hadde it
sworn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1090">1090</span></span> So stood
the hevene whan that we were born.  
<span id="an_1091"></span> We moste endure it; this is the short and
playn."  
<span id="an_1092"></span> This Palamon answerde and seyde agayn,  
<span id="an_1093"></span> "Cosyn, for sothe, of this opinioun  
<span id="an_1094"></span> Thow hast a veyn ymaginacioun.  
<span id="an_1095"></span> This prison caused me nat for to crye,  
<span id="an_1096"></span> But I was hurt right now thurghout myn ye  
<span id="an_1097"></span> Into myn herte, that wol my bane be.  
<span id="an_1098"></span> The fairnesse of that lady that I see  
<span id="an_1099"></span> Yond in the gardyn romen to and fro  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100">1100</span></span> Is cause of
al my criyng and my wo.  
<span id="an_1101"></span> I noot wher she be womman or goddesse,  
<span id="an_1102"></span> But Venus is it soothly, as I gesse."  
<span id="an_1103"></span> And therwithal on knees doun he fil,  
<span id="an_1104"></span> And seyde, "Venus, if it be thy wil  
<span id="an_1105"></span> Yow in this gardyn thus to transfigure  
<span id="an_1106"></span> Bifore me, sorweful, wrecched creature,  
<span id="an_1107"></span> Out of this prisoun help that we may
scapen.  
<span id="an_1108"></span> And if so be my destynee be shapen  
<span id="an_1109"></span> By eterne word to dyen in prisoun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1110">1110</span></span> Of oure
lynage have som compassioun,  
<span id="an_1111"></span> That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye."  
<span id="an_1112"></span> And with that word Arcite gan espye  
<span id="an_1113"></span> Wher as this lady romed to and fro,  
<span id="an_1114"></span> And with that sighte hir beautee hurte hym
so,  
<span id="an_1115"></span> That, if that Palamon was wounded sore,  
<span id="an_1116"></span> Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or moore.  
<span id="an_1117"></span> And with a sigh he seyde pitously,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1190">1190</span></span> To telle it
yow as shortly as I may,  
<span id="an_1191"></span> A worthy duc that highte Perotheus,  
<span id="an_1192"></span> That felawe was unto duc Theseus  
<span id="an_1193"></span> Syn thilke day that they were children
lite,  
<span id="an_1194"></span> Was come to Atthenes his felawe to visite,  
<span id="an_1195"></span> And for to pleye as he was wont to do;  
<span id="an_1196"></span> For in this world he loved no man so,  
<span id="an_1197"></span> And he loved hym als tendrely agayn.  
<span id="an_1198"></span> So wel they lovede, as olde bookes sayn,  
<span id="an_1199"></span> That whan that oon was deed, soothly to
telle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200">1200</span></span> His felawe
wente and soughte hym doun in helle --  
<span id="an_1201"></span> But of that storie list me nat to write.  
<span id="an_1202"></span> Duc Perotheus loved wel Arcite,  
<span id="an_1203"></span> And hadde hym knowe at Thebes yeer by yere,  
<span id="an_1204"></span> And finally at requeste and preyere  
<span id="an_1205"></span> Of Perotheus, withouten any raunsoun,  
<span id="an_1206"></span> Duc Theseus hym leet out of prisoun  
<span id="an_1207"></span> Frely to goon wher that hym liste over al,  
<span id="an_1208"></span> In swich a gyse as I you tellen shal.  
<span id="an_1209"></span> This was the forward, pleynly for t'

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1210">1210</span></span> Bitwixen
Theseus and hym Arcite:

spedde.  
<span id="an_1218"></span> Lat hym be war! His nekke lith to wedde.  
<span id="an_1219"></span> How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!

<span id="an_1222"></span> To sleen hymself he waiteth prively.  
<span id="an_1223"></span> He seyde, "Allas that day that I was born!

<span id="an_1345"></span> For everemo, as out of that contree,  
<span id="an_1346"></span> Ne nevere mo ne shal his lady see.  
<span id="an_1347"></span> Yow loveres axe I now this questioun:  
<span id="an_1348"></span> Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?  
<span id="an_1349"></span> That oon may seen his lady day by day,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1350">1350</span></span> But in

<span id="an_1351"></span> That oother wher hym list may ride or go,  
<span id="an_1352"></span> But seen his lady shal he nevere mo.  
<span id="an_1353"></span> Now demeth as yow liste, ye that kan,  
<span id="an_1354"></span> For I wol telle forth as I bigan.  
<span id="an_1355"></span> Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,  
<span id="an_1356"></span> Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde "Allas!"  
<span id="an_1357"></span> For seen his lady shal he nevere mo.  
<span id="an_1358"></span> And shortly to concluden al his wo,  
<span id="an_1359"></span> So muche sorwe hadde nevere creature  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1360">1360</span></span> That is, or

<span id="an_1361"></span> His slep, his mete, his drynke, is hym
biraft,  
<span id="an_1362"></span> That lene he wex and drye as is a shaft;

chaunged so, that no man koude knowe  
<span id="an_1371"></span> His speche nor his voys, though men it

<span id="an_1372"></span> And in his geere for al the world he ferde  
<span id="an_1373"></span> Nat oonly lik the loveris maladye

<span id="an_1377"></span> And shortly, turned was al up so doun  
<span id="an_1378"></span> Bothe habit and eek disposicioun  
<span id="an_1379"></span> Of hym, this woful lovere daun Arcite.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1380">1380</span></span> What sholde
I al day of his wo endite?  
<span id="an_1381"></span> Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two  
<span id="an_1382"></span> This crueel torment and this peyne and wo,  
<span id="an_1383"></span> At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,  
<span id="an_1384"></span> Upon a nyght in sleep as he hym leyde,  
<span id="an_1385"></span> Hym thoughte how that the wynged god
Mercurie  
<span id="an_1386"></span> Biforn hym stood and bad hym to be murie.  
<span id="an_1387"></span> His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;  
<span id="an_1388"></span> An hat he werede upon his heris brighte.  
<span id="an_1389"></span> Arrayed was this god, as he took keep,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1390">1390</span></span> As he was
whan that Argus took his sleep;  
<span id="an_1391"></span> And seyde hym thus: "To Atthenes shaltou
wende,  
<span id="an_1392"></span> Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende."  
<span id="an_1393"></span> And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.  
<span id="an_1394"></span> "Now trewely, hou soore that me smerte,"  
<span id="an_1395"></span> Quod he, "to Atthenes right now wol I fare,  
<span id="an_1396"></span> Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare  
<span id="an_1397"></span> To se my lady, that I love and serve.  
<span id="an_1398"></span> In hire presence I recche nat to sterve."  
<span id="an_1399"></span> And with that word he caughte a greet
mirour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400">1400</span></span> And saugh
that chaunged was al his colour,  
<span id="an_1401"></span> And saugh his visage al in another kynde.  
<span id="an_1402"></span> And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,  
<span id="an_1403"></span> That, sith his face was so disfigured  
<span id="an_1404"></span> Of maladye the which he hadde endured,  
<span id="an_1405"></span> He myghte wel, if that he bar hym lowe,  
<span id="an_1406"></span> Lyve in Atthenes everemoore unknowe,  
<span id="an_1407"></span> And seen his lady wel ny day by day.  
<span id="an_1408"></span> And right anon he chaunged his array,  
<span id="an_1409"></span> And cladde hym as a povre laborer,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1410">1410</span></span> And al
allone, save oonly a squier  
<span id="an_1411"></span> That knew his privetee and al his cas,  
<span id="an_1412"></span> Which was disgised povrely as he was,  
<span id="an_1413"></span> To Atthenes is he goon the nexte way.  
<span id="an_1414"></span> And to the court he wente upon a day,  
<span id="an_1415"></span> And at the gate he profreth his servyse  
<span id="an_1416"></span> To drugge and drawe, what so men wol
devyse.  
<span id="an_1417"></span> And shortly of this matere for to seyn,  
<span id="an_1418"></span> He fil in office with a chamberleyn  
<span id="an_1419"></span> The which that dwellynge was with Emelye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1420">1420</span></span> For he was
wys and koude soone espye,  
<span id="an_1421"></span> Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.  
<span id="an_1422"></span> Wel koude he hewen wode, and water bere,  
<span id="an_1423"></span> For he was yong and myghty for the nones,  
<span id="an_1424"></span> And therto he was long and big of bones  
<span id="an_1425"></span> To doon that any wight kan hym devyse.  
<span id="an_1426"></span> A yeer or two he was in this servyse,  
<span id="an_1427"></span> Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte,  
<span id="an_1428"></span> And Philostrate he seyde that he highte.  
<span id="an_1429"></span> But half so wel biloved a man as he  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1430">1430</span></span> Ne was ther
nevere in court of his degree;  
<span id="an_1431"></span> He was so gentil of condicioun  
<span id="an_1432"></span> That thurghout al the court was his renoun.  
<span id="an_1433"></span> They seyden that it were a charitee  
<span id="an_1434"></span> That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,  
<span id="an_1435"></span> And putten hym in worshipful servyse,  
<span id="an_1436"></span> Ther as he myghte his vertu excercise.  
<span id="an_1437"></span> And thus withinne a while his name is
spronge,  
<span id="an_1438"></span> Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,  
<span id="an_1439"></span> That Theseus hath taken hym so neer  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1440">1440</span></span> That of his
chambre he made hym a squier,  
<span id="an_1441"></span> And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.  
<span id="an_1442"></span> And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,  
<span id="an_1443"></span> From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;  
<span id="an_1444"></span> But honestly and slyly he it spente,  
<span id="an_1445"></span> That no man wondred how that he it hadde.  
<span id="an_1446"></span> And thre yeer in this wise his lif he
ladde,  
<span id="an_1447"></span> And bar hym so, in pees and eek in werre,  
<span id="an_1448"></span> Ther was no man that Theseus hath derre.  
<span id="an_1449"></span> And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1450">1450</span></span> And speke I
wole of Palamon a lite.  
<span id="an_1451"></span> In derknesse and horrible and strong
prisoun  
<span id="an_1452"></span> Thise seven yeer hath seten Palamoun  
<span id="an_1453"></span> Forpyned, what for wo and for distresse.  
<span id="an_1454"></span> Who feeleth double soor and hevynesse  
<span id="an_1455"></span> But Palamon, that love destreyneth so  
<span id="an_1456"></span> That wood out of his wit he goth for wo?  
<span id="an_1457"></span> And eek therto he is a prisoner  
<span id="an_1458"></span> Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.  
<span id="an_1459"></span> Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1460">1460</span></span> His
martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;  
<span id="an_1461"></span> Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.  
<span id="an_1462"></span> It fel that in the seventhe yer, of May  
<span id="an_1463"></span> The thridde nyght (as olde bookes seyn,  
<span id="an_1464"></span> That al this storie tellen moore pleyn),  
<span id="an_1465"></span> Were it by aventure or destynee --  
<span id="an_1466"></span> As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be --  
<span id="an_1467"></span> That soone after the mydnyght Palamoun,  
<span id="an_1468"></span> By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisoun  
<span id="an_1469"></span> And fleeth the citee faste as he may go.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1470">1470</span></span> For he
hadde yeve his gayler drynke so  
<span id="an_1471"></span> Of a clarree maad of a certeyn wyn,  
<span id="an_1472"></span> With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,  
<span id="an_1473"></span> That al that nyght, thogh that men wolde him
shake,  
<span id="an_1474"></span> The gayler sleep; he myghte nat awake.  
<span id="an_1475"></span> And thus he fleeth as faste as evere he
may.  
<span id="an_1476"></span> The nyght was short and faste by the day  
<span id="an_1477"></span> That nedes cost he moot hymselven hyde,  
<span id="an_1478"></span> And til a grove faste ther bisyde  
<span id="an_1479"></span> With dredeful foot thanne stalketh Palamon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1480">1480</span></span> For,
shortly, this was his opinion:  
<span id="an_1481"></span> That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al
day,  
<span id="an_1482"></span> And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his
way  
<span id="an_1483"></span> To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye  
<span id="an_1484"></span> On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;  
<span id="an_1485"></span> And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lif  
<span id="an_1486"></span> Or wynnen Emelye unto his wyf.  
<span id="an_1487"></span> This is th' effect and his entente pleyn.  
<span id="an_1488"></span> Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,  
<span id="an_1489"></span> That litel wiste how ny that was his care,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1490">1490</span></span> Til that
Fortune had broght him in the snare.  
<span id="an_1491"></span> The bisy larke, messager of day,  
<span id="an_1492"></span> Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,  
<span id="an_1493"></span> And firy Phebus riseth up so bright  
<span id="an_1494"></span> That al the orient laugheth of the light,  
<span id="an_1495"></span> And with his stremes dryeth in the greves  
<span id="an_1496"></span> The silver dropes hangynge on the leves.  
<span id="an_1497"></span> And Arcita, that in the court roial  
<span id="an_1498"></span> With Theseus is squier principal,  
<span id="an_1499"></span> Is risen and looketh on the myrie day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500">1500</span></span> And for to
doon his observaunce to May,  
<span id="an_1501"></span> Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir,  
<span id="an_1502"></span> He on a courser, startlynge as the fir,  
<span id="an_1503"></span> Is riden into the feeldes hym to pleye,  
<span id="an_1504"></span> Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.  
<span id="an_1505"></span> And to the grove of which that I yow tolde  
<span id="an_1506"></span> By aventure his wey he gan to holde  
<span id="an_1507"></span> To maken hym a gerland of the greves,  
<span id="an_1508"></span> Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leves,  
<span id="an_1509"></span> And loude he song ayeyn the sonne shene:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1510">1510</span></span> "May, with
alle thy floures and thy grene,  
<span id="an_1511"></span> Welcome be thou, faire, fresshe May,  
<span id="an_1512"></span> In hope that I som grene gete may."  
<span id="an_1513"></span> And from his courser, with a lusty herte,  
<span id="an_1514"></span> Into the grove ful hastily he sterte,  
<span id="an_1515"></span> And in a path he rometh up and doun,  
<span id="an_1516"></span> Ther as by aventure this Palamoun  
<span id="an_1517"></span> Was in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se,  
<span id="an_1518"></span> For soore afered of his deeth was he.  
<span id="an_1519"></span> No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1520">1520</span></span> God woot he
wolde have trowed it ful lite.  
<span id="an_1521"></span> But sooth is seyd, go sithen many yeres,  
<span id="an_1522"></span> That "feeld hath eyen and the wode hath
eres."  
<span id="an_1523"></span> It is ful fair a man to bere hym evene,  
<span id="an_1524"></span> For al day meeteth men at unset stevene.  
<span id="an_1525"></span> Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,  
<span id="an_1526"></span> That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,  
<span id="an_1527"></span> For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.  
<span id="an_1528"></span> Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille,  
<span id="an_1529"></span> And songen al the roundel lustily,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1530">1530</span></span> Into a
studie he fil sodeynly,  
<span id="an_1531"></span> As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,  
<span id="an_1532"></span> Now in the crope, now doun in the breres,  

 

<span id="an_1533"></span> Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle.  
<span id="an_1534"></span> Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,  
<span id="an_1535"></span> Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,  
<span id="an_1536"></span> Right so kan geery Venus overcaste  
<span id="an_1537"></span> The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day  
<span id="an_1538"></span> Is gereful, right so chaungeth she array.  
<span id="an_1539"></span> Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1540">1540</span></span> Whan that
Arcite had songe, he gan to sike  
<span id="an_1541"></span> And sette hym doun withouten any moore.  
<span id="an_1542"></span> "Allas," quod he, "that day that I was
bore!  
<span id="an_1543"></span> How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,  
<span id="an_1544"></span> Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?  
<span id="an_1545"></span> Allas, ybroght is to confusioun  
<span id="an_1546"></span> The blood roial of Cadme and Amphioun --  
<span id="an_1547"></span> Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man  
<span id="an_1548"></span> That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,  
<span id="an_1549"></span> And of the citee first was crouned kyng.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1550">1550</span></span> Of his

<span id="an_1551"></span> By verray ligne, as of the stok roial,  
<span id="an_1552"></span> And now I am so caytyf and so thral,  
<span id="an_1553"></span> That he that is my mortal enemy,  
<span id="an_1554"></span> I serve hym as his squier povrely.  
<span id="an_1555"></span> And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,  
<span id="an_1556"></span> For I dar noght biknowe myn owene name;  
<span id="an_1557"></span> But ther as I was wont to highte Arcite,  
<span id="an_1558"></span> Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a

<span id="an_1559"></span> Allas, thou felle Mars! Allas, Juno!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1560">1560</span></span> Thus hath
youre ire oure lynage al fordo,  
<span id="an_1561"></span> Save oonly me and wrecched Palamoun,  
<span id="an_1562"></span> That Theseus martireth in prisoun.  
<span id="an_1563"></span> And over al this, to sleen me outrely  
<span id="an_1564"></span> Love hath his firy dart so brennyngly  
<span id="an_1565"></span> Ystiked thurgh my trewe, careful herte

nat the montance of a tare,  
<span id="an_1571"></span> So that I koude doon aught to youre

<span id="an_1572"></span> And with that word he fil doun in a traunce  
<span id="an_1573"></span> A longe tyme, and after he up sterte.  
<span id="an_1574"></span> This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his

<span id="an_1575"></span> He felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,  
<span id="an_1576"></span> For ire he quook; no lenger wolde he byde.  
<span id="an_1577"></span> And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,  
<span id="an_1578"></span> As he were wood, with face deed and pale,  
<span id="an_1579"></span> He stirte hym up out of the buskes thikke  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1580">1580</span></span> And seide:
"Arcite, false traytour wikke,  
<span id="an_1581"></span> Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,  
<span id="an_1582"></span> For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,

<span id="an_1596"></span> This Arcite, with ful despitous herte,  
<span id="an_1597"></span> Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,  
<span id="an_1598"></span> As fiers as leon pulled out his swerd,  
<span id="an_1599"></span> And seyde thus: "By God that sit above,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1620">1620</span></span> This
Palamon answerde, "I graunte it thee."  
<span id="an_1621"></span> And thus they been departed til amorwe,  
<span id="an_1622"></span> Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith to

<span id="an_1634"></span> He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.  
<span id="an_1635"></span> And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,  
<span id="an_1636"></span> This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.  
<span id="an_1637"></span> To chaungen gan the colour in hir face;  
<span id="an_1638"></span> Right as the hunters in the regne of Trace,  
<span id="an_1639"></span> That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1640">1640</span></span> Whan hunted
is the leon or the bere,  
<span id="an_1641"></span> And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,  
<span id="an_1642"></span> And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,  
<span id="an_1643"></span> And thynketh, "Heere cometh my mortal
enemy!  
<span id="an_1644"></span> Withoute faille, he moot be deed, or I,  
<span id="an_1645"></span> For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,  
<span id="an_1646"></span> Or he moot sleen me, if that me myshappe."  
<span id="an_1647"></span> So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,  
<span id="an_1648"></span> As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.  
<span id="an_1649"></span> Ther nas no good day, ne no saluyng,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1650">1650</span></span> But
streight, withouten word or rehersyng,  
<span id="an_1651"></span> Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother  
<span id="an_1652"></span> As freendly as he were his owene brother;  
<span id="an_1653"></span> And after that, with sharpe speres stronge  
<span id="an_1654"></span> They foynen ech at oother wonder longe.  
<span id="an_1655"></span> Thou myghtest wene that this Palamon  
<span id="an_1656"></span> In his fightyng were a wood leon,  
<span id="an_1657"></span> And as a crueel tigre was Arcite;  
<span id="an_1658"></span> As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,  
<span id="an_1659"></span> That frothen whit as foom for ire wood.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1660">1660</span></span> Up to the
ancle foghte they in hir blood.  
<span id="an_1661"></span> And in this wise I lete hem fightyng
dwelle,  
<span id="an_1662"></span> And forth I wole of Theseus yow telle.  
<span id="an_1663"></span> The destinee, ministre general,  
<span id="an_1664"></span> That executeth in the world over al  
<span id="an_1665"></span> The purveiaunce that God hath seyn biforn,  
<span id="an_1666"></span> So strong it is that, though the world had
sworn  
<span id="an_1667"></span> The contrarie of a thyng by ye or nay,  
<span id="an_1668"></span> Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day  
<span id="an_1669"></span> That falleth nat eft withinne a thousand

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1670">1670</span></span> For
certeinly, oure appetites heer,  
<span id="an_1671"></span> Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,  
<span id="an_1672"></span> Al is this reuled by the sighte above.  
<span id="an_1673"></span> This mene I now by myghty Theseus,  
<span id="an_1674"></span> That for to hunten is so desirus,  
<span id="an_1675"></span> And namely at the grete hert in May,  
<span id="an_1676"></span> That in his bed ther daweth hym no day  
<span id="an_1677"></span> That he nys clad, and redy for to ryde  
<span id="an_1678"></span> With hunte and horn and houndes hym bisyde.  
<span id="an_1679"></span> For in his huntyng hath he swich delit  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1680">1680</span></span> That it is
al his joye and appetit  
<span id="an_1681"></span> To been hymself the grete hertes bane,  
<span id="an_1682"></span> For after Mars he serveth now Dyane.  
<span id="an_1683"></span> Cleer was the day, as I have toold er this,  
<span id="an_1684"></span> And Theseus with alle joye and blis,  
<span id="an_1685"></span> With his Ypolita, the faire queene,  
<span id="an_1686"></span> And Emelye, clothed al in grene,  
<span id="an_1687"></span> On huntyng be they riden roially.  
<span id="an_1688"></span> And to the grove that stood ful faste by,  
<span id="an_1689"></span> In which ther was an hert, as men hym
tolde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1690">1690</span></span> Duc Theseus
the streighte wey hath holde.  
<span id="an_1691"></span> And to the launde he rideth hym ful right,  
<span id="an_1692"></span> For thider was the hert wont have his
flight,  
<span id="an_1693"></span> And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.  
<span id="an_1694"></span> This duc wol han a cours at hym or tweye  
<span id="an_1695"></span> With houndes swiche as that hym list
comaunde.  
<span id="an_1696"></span> And whan this duc was come unto the launde,  
<span id="an_1697"></span> Under the sonne he looketh, and anon  
<span id="an_1698"></span> He was war of Arcite and Palamon,  
<span id="an_1699"></span> That foughten breme as it were bores two.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700">1700</span></span> The brighte
swerdes wenten to and fro  
<span id="an_1701"></span> So hidously that with the leeste strook  
<span id="an_1702"></span> It semed as it wolde felle an ook.  
<span id="an_1703"></span> But what they were, no thyng he ne woot.  
<span id="an_1704"></span> This duc his courser with his spores smoot,  
<span id="an_1705"></span> And at a stert he was bitwix hem two,  
<span id="an_1706"></span> And pulled out a swerd and cride, "Hoo!  
<span id="an_1707"></span> Namoore, up peyne of lesynge of youre heed!  
<span id="an_1708"></span> By myghty Mars, he shal anon be deed  
<span id="an_1709"></span> That smyteth any strook that I may seen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1710">1710</span></span> But telleth

<span id="an_1711"></span> That been so hardy for to fighten heere  
<span id="an_1712"></span> Withouten juge or oother officere,  
<span id="an_1713"></span> As it were in a lystes roially."  
<span id="an_1714"></span> This Palamon answerde hastily  
<span id="an_1715"></span> And seyde, "Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?  
<span id="an_1716"></span> We have the deeth disserved bothe two.  
<span id="an_1717"></span> Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,  
<span id="an_1718"></span> That been encombred of oure owene lyves;  
<span id="an_1719"></span> And as thou art a rightful lord and juge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1720">1720</span></span> Ne yif us
neither mercy ne refuge,  
<span id="an_1721"></span> But sle me first, for seinte charitee!  
<span id="an_1722"></span> But sle my felawe eek as wel as me;  
<span id="an_1723"></span> Or sle hym first, for though thow knowest it
lite,  
<span id="an_1724"></span> This is thy mortal foo, this is Arcite,  
<span id="an_1725"></span> That fro thy lond is banysshed on his heed,  
<span id="an_1726"></span> For which he hath deserved to be deed.  
<span id="an_1727"></span> For this is he that cam unto thy gate  
<span id="an_1728"></span> And seyde that he highte Philostrate.  
<span id="an_1729"></span> Thus hath he japed thee ful many a yer,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1730">1730</span></span> And thou
hast maked hym thy chief squier;  
<span id="an_1731"></span> And this is he that loveth Emelye.  
<span id="an_1732"></span> For sith the day is come that I shal dye,  
<span id="an_1733"></span> I make pleynly my confessioun  
<span id="an_1734"></span> That I am thilke woful Palamoun  
<span id="an_1735"></span> That hath thy prisoun broken wikkedly.  
<span id="an_1736"></span> I am thy mortal foo, and it am I  
<span id="an_1737"></span> That loveth so hoote Emelye the brighte  
<span id="an_1738"></span> That I wol dye present in hir sighte.  
<span id="an_1739"></span> Wherfore I axe deeth and my juwise;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1740">1740</span></span> But sle my
felawe in the same wise,  
<span id="an_1741"></span> For bothe han we deserved to be slayn."  
<span id="an_1742"></span> This worthy duc answerde anon agayn,  
<span id="an_1743"></span> And seyde, "This is a short conclusioun.  
<span id="an_1744"></span> Youre owene mouth, by youre confessioun,  
<span id="an_1745"></span> Hath dampned yow, and I wol it recorde;  
<span id="an_1746"></span> It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.  
<span id="an_1747"></span> Ye shal be deed, by myghty Mars the rede!"  
<span id="an_1748"></span> The queene anon, for verray wommanhede,  
<span id="an_1749"></span> Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1750">1750</span></span> And alle
the ladyes in the compaignye.  
<span id="an_1751"></span> Greet pitee was it, as it thoughte hem
alle,  
<span id="an_1752"></span> That evere swich a chaunce sholde falle,  
<span id="an_1753"></span> For gentil men they were of greet estaat,  
<span id="an_1754"></span> And no thyng but for love was this debaat;  
<span id="an_1755"></span> And saugh hir blody woundes wyde and soore,  
<span id="an_1756"></span> And alle crieden, bothe lasse and moore,  
<span id="an_1757"></span> "Have mercy, Lord, upon us wommen alle!"  
<span id="an_1758"></span> And on hir bare knees adoun they falle  
<span id="an_1759"></span> And wolde have kist his feet ther as he
stood;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1760">1760</span></span> Til at the
laste aslaked was his mood,  
<span id="an_1761"></span> For pitee renneth soone in gentil herte.  
<span id="an_1762"></span> And though he first for ire quook and
sterte,  
<span id="an_1763"></span> He hath considered shortly, in a clause,  
<span id="an_1764"></span> The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the
cause,  
<span id="an_1765"></span> And although that his ire hir gilt accused,  
<span id="an_1766"></span> Yet in his resoun he hem bothe excused,  
<span id="an_1767"></span> As thus: he thoghte wel that every man  
<span id="an_1768"></span> Wol helpe hymself in love, if that he kan,  
<span id="an_1769"></span> And eek delivere hymself out of prisoun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1770">1770</span></span> And eek his
herte hadde compassioun  
<span id="an_1771"></span> Of wommen, for they wepen evere in oon,  
<span id="an_1772"></span> And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon,  
<span id="an_1773"></span> And softe unto hymself he seyde, "Fy  
<span id="an_1774"></span> Upon a lord that wol have no mercy,  
<span id="an_1775"></span> But been a leon, bothe in word and dede,  
<span id="an_1776"></span> To hem that been in repentaunce and drede,  
<span id="an_1777"></span> As wel as to a proud despitous man  
<span id="an_1778"></span> That wol mayntene that he first bigan.  
<span id="an_1779"></span> That lord hath litel of discrecioun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1780">1780</span></span> That in
swich cas kan no divisioun  
<span id="an_1781"></span> But weyeth pride and humblesse after oon."  
<span id="an_1782"></span> And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,  

 

<span id="an_1783"></span> He gan to looken up with eyen lighte  
<span id="an_1784"></span> And spak thise same wordes al on highte:  
<span id="an_1785"></span> "The god of love, a benedicite!  
<span id="an_1786"></span> How myghty and how greet a lord is he!  
<span id="an_1787"></span> Ayeyns his myght ther gayneth none
obstacles.  
<span id="an_1788"></span> He may be cleped a god for his myracles,  
<span id="an_1789"></span> For he kan maken, at his owene gyse,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1790">1790</span></span> Of everich
herte as that hym list divyse.  
<span id="an_1791"></span> Lo heere this Arcite and this Palamoun,  
<span id="an_1792"></span> That quitly weren out of my prisoun,  
<span id="an_1793"></span> And myghte han lyved in Thebes roially,  
<span id="an_1794"></span> And witen I am hir mortal enemy,  
<span id="an_1795"></span> And that hir deth lith in my myght also,  
<span id="an_1796"></span> And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,  
<span id="an_1797"></span> Broght hem hyder bothe for to dye.  
<span id="an_1798"></span> Now looketh, is nat that an heigh folye?  
<span id="an_1799"></span> Who may been a fool but if he love?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800">1800</span></span> Bihoold,
for Goddes sake that sit above,  
<span id="an_1801"></span> Se how they blede! Be they noght wel
arrayed?  
<span id="an_1802"></span> Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, ypayed  
<span id="an_1803"></span> Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!  
<span id="an_1804"></span> And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse  
<span id="an_1805"></span> That serven love, for aught that may
bifalle.  
<span id="an_1806"></span> But this is yet the beste game of alle,  
<span id="an_1807"></span> That she for whom they han this jolitee  
<span id="an_1808"></span> Kan hem therfore as muche thank as me.  
<span id="an_1809"></span> She woot namoore of al this hoote fare,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1810">1810</span></span> By God,
than woot a cokkow or an hare!  
<span id="an_1811"></span> But all moot ben assayed, hoot and coold;  
<span id="an_1812"></span> A man moot ben a fool, or yong or oold --  
<span id="an_1813"></span> I woot it by myself ful yore agon,  
<span id="an_1814"></span> For in my tyme a servant was I oon.  
<span id="an_1815"></span> And therfore, syn I knowe of loves peyne  
<span id="an_1816"></span> And woot hou soore it kan a man distreyne,  
<span id="an_1817"></span> As he that hath ben caught ofte in his

<span id="an_1827"></span> And hym of lordshipe and of mercy preyde,  
<span id="an_1828"></span> And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he

<span id="an_1895"></span> And shortly to concluden, swich a place  
<span id="an_1896"></span> Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space;  
<span id="an_1897"></span> For in the lond ther was no crafty man  
<span id="an_1898"></span> That geometrie or ars-metrike kan,  
<span id="an_1899"></span> Ne portreyour, ne kervere of ymages,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900">1900</span></span> That
Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages  

 

<span id="an_1901"></span> The theatre for to maken and devyse.  
<span id="an_1902"></span> And for to doon his ryte and sacrifise,  
<span id="an_1903"></span> He estward hath, upon the gate above,  
<span id="an_1904"></span> In worshipe of Venus, goddesse of love,  
<span id="an_1905"></span> Doon make an auter and an oratorie;  
<span id="an_1906"></span> And on the gate westward, in memorie  
<span id="an_1907"></span> Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another,  
<span id="an_1908"></span> That coste largely of gold a fother.  
<span id="an_1909"></span> And northward, in a touret on the wal,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1910">1910</span></span> Of
alabastre whit and reed coral,  
<span id="an_1911"></span> An oratorie, riche for to see,  
<span id="an_1912"></span> In worshipe of Dyane of chastitee,  
<span id="an_1913"></span> Hath Theseus doon wroght in noble wyse.  
<span id="an_1914"></span> But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse  
<span id="an_1915"></span> The noble kervyng and the portreitures,  
<span id="an_1916"></span> The shap, the contenaunce, and the figures  
<span id="an_1917"></span> That weren in thise oratories thre.  
<span id="an_1918"></span> First in the temple of Venus maystow se  
<span id="an_1919"></span> Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1920">1920</span></span> The broken
slepes, and the sikes colde,  
<span id="an_1921"></span> The sacred teeris, and the waymentynge,  
<span id="an_1922"></span> The firy strokes of the desirynge  
<span id="an_1923"></span> That loves servantz in this lyf enduren;  
<span id="an_1924"></span> The othes that hir covenantz assuren;  
<span id="an_1925"></span> Plesaunce and Hope, Desir, Foolhardynesse,  
<span id="an_1926"></span> Beautee and Youthe, Bauderie, Richesse,  
<span id="an_1927"></span> Charmes and Force, Lesynges, Flaterye,  
<span id="an_1928"></span> Despense, Bisynesse, and Jalousye,  
<span id="an_1929"></span> That wered of yelewe gooldes a gerland,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1930">1930</span></span> And a
cokkow sittynge on hir hand;  
<span id="an_1931"></span> Festes, instrumentz, caroles, daunces,  
<span id="an_1932"></span> Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces  
<span id="an_1933"></span> Of love, which that I rekned and rekne
shal,  
<span id="an_1934"></span> By ordre weren peynted on the wal,  
<span id="an_1935"></span> And mo than I kan make of mencioun.  
<span id="an_1936"></span> For soothly al the mount of Citheroun,  
<span id="an_1937"></span> Ther Venus hath hir principal dwellynge,  
<span id="an_1938"></span> Was shewed on the wal in portreyynge,  
<span id="an_1939"></span> With al the gardyn and the lustynesse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1940">1940</span></span> Nat was
foryeten the porter, Ydelnesse,  
<span id="an_1941"></span> Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon,  
<span id="an_1942"></span> Ne yet the folye of kyng Salomon,

<span id="an_1944"></span> Th' enchauntementz of Medea and Circes --  
<span id="an_1945"></span> Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage,  
<span id="an_1946"></span> The riche Cresus, kaytyf in servage.  
<span id="an_1947"></span> Thus may ye seen that wysdom ne richesse,  
<span id="an_1948"></span> Beautee ne sleighte, strengthe ne
hardynesse,  
<span id="an_1949"></span> Ne may with Venus holde champartie,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1950">1950</span></span> For as hir
list the world than may she gye.  
<span id="an_1951"></span> Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir

<span id="an_1952"></span> Til they for wo ful ofte seyde "allas!"  
<span id="an_1953"></span> Suffiseth heere ensamples oon or two,  
<span id="an_1954"></span> And though I koude rekene a thousand mo.  
<span id="an_1955"></span> The statue of Venus, glorious for to se,  
<span id="an_1956"></span> Was naked, fletynge in the large see,  
<span id="an_1957"></span> And fro the navele doun al covered was  
<span id="an_1958"></span> With wawes grene, and brighte as any glas.  
<span id="an_1959"></span> A citole in hir right hand hadde she,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1960">1960</span></span> And on hir

<span id="an_1961"></span> A rose gerland, fressh and wel smellynge;  
<span id="an_1962"></span> Above hir heed hir dowves flikerynge.  
<span id="an_1963"></span> Biforn hire stood hir sone Cupido;  
<span id="an_1964"></span> Upon his shuldres wynges hadde he two,  
<span id="an_1965"></span> And blynd he was, as it is often seene;  
<span id="an_1966"></span> A bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene.  
<span id="an_1967"></span> Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al  
<span id="an_1968"></span> The portreiture that was upon the wal  
<span id="an_1969"></span> Withinne the temple of myghty Mars the

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1970">1970</span></span> Al peynted
was the wal, in lengthe and brede,  
<span id="an_1971"></span> Lyk to the estres of the grisly place  
<span id="an_1972"></span> That highte the grete temple of Mars in
Trace,  
<span id="an_1973"></span> In thilke colde, frosty regioun  
<span id="an_1974"></span> Ther as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun.  
<span id="an_1975"></span> First on the wal was peynted a forest,  
<span id="an_1976"></span> In which ther dwelleth neither man ne best,  
<span id="an_1977"></span> With knotty, knarry, bareyne trees olde,  
<span id="an_1978"></span> Of stubbes sharpe and hidouse to biholde,  
<span id="an_1979"></span> In which ther ran a rumbel in a swough,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1980">1980</span></span> As though a
storm sholde bresten every bough.  
<span id="an_1981"></span> And dounward from an hille, under a bente,  
<span id="an_1982"></span> Ther stood the temple of Mars armypotente,  
<span id="an_1983"></span> Wroght al of burned steel, of which the
entree  
<span id="an_1984"></span> Was long and streit, and gastly for to see.  
<span id="an_1985"></span> And therout came a rage and swich a veze  
<span id="an_1986"></span> That it made al the gate for to rese.  
<span id="an_1987"></span> The northren lyght in at the dores shoon,  
<span id="an_1988"></span> For wyndowe on the wal ne was ther noon,  
<span id="an_1989"></span> Thurgh which men myghten any light

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1990">1990</span></span> The dore
was al of adamant eterne,  
<span id="an_1991"></span> Yclenched overthwart and endelong  
<span id="an_1992"></span> With iren tough; and for to make it strong,  
<span id="an_1993"></span> Every pyler, the temple to sustene,  
<span id="an_1994"></span> Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.  
<span id="an_1995"></span> Ther saugh I first the derke ymaginyng  
<span id="an_1996"></span> Of Felonye, and al the compassyng;  
<span id="an_1997"></span> The crueel Ire, reed as any gleede;  
<span id="an_1998"></span> The pykepurs, and eek the pale Drede;  
<span id="an_1999"></span> The smylere with the knyf under the cloke;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2000">2000</span></span> The shepne
brennynge with the blake smoke;  
<span id="an_2001"></span> The tresoun of the mordrynge in the bedde;  
<span id="an_2002"></span> The open werre, with woundes al bibledde;  
<span id="an_2003"></span> Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace.  
<span id="an_2004"></span> Al ful of chirkyng was that sory place.  
<span id="an_2005"></span> The sleere of hymself yet saugh I ther --  
<span id="an_2006"></span> His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer --  
<span id="an_2007"></span> The nayl ydryven in the shode anyght;  
<span id="an_2008"></span> The colde deeth, with mouth gapyng upright.  
<span id="an_2009"></span> Amyddes of the temple sat Meschaunce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010">2010</span></span> With
disconfort and sory contenaunce.  
<span id="an_2011"></span> Yet saugh I Woodnesse, laughynge in his
rage,  
<span id="an_2012"></span> Armed Compleint, Outhees, and fiers
Outrage;  
<span id="an_2013"></span> The careyne in the busk, with throte
ycorve;  
<span id="an_2014"></span> A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm ystorve;  
<span id="an_2015"></span> The tiraunt, with the pray by force yraft;  
<span id="an_2016"></span> The toun destroyed, ther was no thyng laft.  
<span id="an_2017"></span> Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres;  
<span id="an_2018"></span> The hunte strangled with the wilde beres;  
<span id="an_2019"></span> The sowe freten the child right in the
cradel;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2020">2020</span></span> The cook
yscalded, for al his longe ladel.  
<span id="an_2021"></span> Noght was foryeten by the infortune of
Marte.  
<span id="an_2022"></span> The cartere overryden with his carte --  
<span id="an_2023"></span> Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.  
<span id="an_2024"></span> Ther were also, of Martes divisioun,  
<span id="an_2025"></span> The barbour, and the bocher, and the smyth,  
<span id="an_2026"></span> That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his styth.  
<span id="an_2027"></span> And al above, depeynted in a tour,  
<span id="an_2028"></span> Saugh I Conquest, sittynge in greet honour,  
<span id="an_2029"></span> With the sharpe swerd over his heed  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2030">2030</span></span> Hangynge by
a soutil twynes threed.  
<span id="an_2031"></span> Depeynted was the slaughtre of Julius,  
<span id="an_2032"></span> Of grete Nero, and of Antonius;  
<span id="an_2033"></span> Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn,  
<span id="an_2034"></span> Yet was hir deth depeynted ther-biforn  
<span id="an_2035"></span> By manasynge of Mars, right by figure;  
<span id="an_2036"></span> So was it shewed in that portreiture,  
<span id="an_2037"></span> As is depeynted in the sterres above  
<span id="an_2038"></span> Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.  
<span id="an_2039"></span> Suffiseth oon ensample in stories olde;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2040">2040</span></span> I may nat
rekene hem alle though I wolde.  
<span id="an_2041"></span> The statue of Mars upon a carte stood  
<span id="an_2042"></span> Armed, and looked grym as he were wood;  
<span id="an_2043"></span> And over his heed ther shynen two figures  

 

<span id="an_2044"></span> Of sterres, that been cleped in scriptures,  
<span id="an_2045"></span> That oon Puella, that oother Rubeus --  
<span id="an_2046"></span> This god of armes was arrayed thus.  
<span id="an_2047"></span> A wolf ther stood biforn hym at his feet  
<span id="an_2048"></span> With eyen rede, and of a man he eet;  
<span id="an_2049"></span> With soutil pencel was depeynted this
storie  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2050">2050</span></span> In
redoutynge of Mars and of his glorie.  
<span id="an_2051"></span> Now to the temple of Dyane the chaste,  
<span id="an_2052"></span> As shortly as I kan, I wol me haste,  
<span id="an_2053"></span> To telle yow al the descripsioun.  
<span id="an_2054"></span> Depeynted been the walles up and doun  
<span id="an_2055"></span> Of huntyng and of shamefast chastitee.  
<span id="an_2056"></span> Ther saugh I how woful Calistopee,  
<span id="an_2057"></span> Whan that Diane agreved was with here,  
<span id="an_2058"></span> Was turned from a womman til a bere,  
<span id="an_2059"></span> And after was she maad the loode-sterre.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2060">2060</span></span> Thus was it
peynted; I kan sey yow no ferre.  
<span id="an_2061"></span> Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see.  
<span id="an_2062"></span> Ther saugh I Dane, yturned til a tree --  
<span id="an_2063"></span> I mene nat the goddesse Diane,  
<span id="an_2064"></span> But Penneus doghter, which that highte

<span id="an_2065"></span> Ther saugh I Attheon an hert ymaked,  
<span id="an_2066"></span> For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al

<span id="an_2067"></span> I saugh how that his houndes have hym
caught  
<span id="an_2068"></span> And freeten hym, for that they knewe hym

<span id="an_2069"></span> Yet peynted was a litel forther moor  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2070">2070</span></span> How
Atthalante hunted the wilde boor,  
<span id="an_2071"></span> And Meleagre, and many another mo,  
<span id="an_2072"></span> For which Dyane wroghte hym care and wo.  
<span id="an_2073"></span> Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,

<span id="an_2076"></span> With smale houndes al aboute hir feet,  
<span id="an_2077"></span> And undernethe hir feet she hadde a moone

<span id="an_2078"></span> Wexynge it was and sholde wanye soone.  
<span id="an_2079"></span> In gaude grene hir statue clothed was,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2080">2080</span></span> With bowe

<span id="an_2081"></span> Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun  
<span id="an_2082"></span> Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun.  
<span id="an_2083"></span> A womman travaillynge was hire biforn;  
<span id="an_2084"></span> But for hir child so longe was unborn,  
<span id="an_2085"></span> Ful pitously Lucyna gan she calle  
<span id="an_2086"></span> And seyde, "Help, for thou mayst best of

<span id="an_2087"></span> Wel koude he peynten lifly that it wroghte;  
<span id="an_2088"></span> With many a floryn he the hewes boghte.  
<span id="an_2089"></span> Now been thise lystes maad, and Theseus,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2090">2090</span></span> That at his

<span id="an_2092"></span> Whan it was doon, hym lyked wonder weel.  
<span id="an_2093"></span> But stynte I wole of Theseus a lite,  
<span id="an_2094"></span> And speke of Palamon and of Arcite.  
<span id="an_2095"></span> The day approcheth of hir retournynge,

<span id="an_2155"></span> With Arcita, in stories as men fynde,  
<span id="an_2156"></span> The grete Emetreus, the kyng of Inde,  
<span id="an_2157"></span> Upon a steede bay trapped in steel,  
<span id="an_2158"></span> Covered in clooth of gold, dyapred weel,  
<span id="an_2159"></span> Cam ridynge lyk the god of armes, Mars.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2160">2160</span></span> His

<span id="an_2162"></span> His sadel was of brend gold newe ybete;  
<span id="an_2163"></span> A mantelet upon his shulder hangynge,  
<span id="an_2164"></span> Bret-ful of rubyes rede as fyr sparklynge;  
<span id="an_2165"></span> His crispe heer lyk rynges was yronne,  
<span id="an_2166"></span> And that was yelow, and glytered as the

<span id="an_2167"></span> His nose was heigh, his eyen bright citryn,  
<span id="an_2168"></span> His lippes rounde, his colour was sangwyn;  
<span id="an_2169"></span> A fewe frakenes in his face yspreynd,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2170">2170</span></span> Bitwixen

<span id="an_2171"></span> And as a leon he his lookyng caste.  
<span id="an_2172"></span> Of fyve and twenty yeer his age I caste.  
<span id="an_2173"></span> His berd was wel bigonne for to sprynge;  
<span id="an_2174"></span> His voys was as a trompe thonderynge.  
<span id="an_2175"></span> Upon his heed he wered of laurer grene  
<span id="an_2176"></span> A gerland, fressh and lusty for to sene.  
<span id="an_2177"></span> Upon his hand he bar for his deduyt  
<span id="an_2178"></span> An egle tame, as any lilye whyt.  
<span id="an_2179"></span> An hundred lordes hadde he with hym there,

<span id="an_2667"></span> She seyde, "I am ashamed, doutelees."  
<span id="an_2668"></span> Saturnus seyde, "Doghter, hoold thy pees!  
<span id="an_2669"></span> Mars hath his wille, his knyght hath al his

<span id="an_2674"></span> But herkneth me, and stynteth noyse a lite,  
<span id="an_2675"></span> Which a myracle ther bifel anon.  
<span id="an_2676"></span> This fierse Arcite hath of his helm ydon,  
<span id="an_2677"></span> And on a courser, for to shewe his face,  
<span id="an_2678"></span> He priketh endelong the large place  
<span id="an_2679"></span> Lokynge upward upon this Emelye;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2680">2680</span></span> And she

<span id="an_2681"></span> (For wommen, as to speken in comune,  
<span id="an_2682"></span> Thei folwen alle the favour of Fortune)  
<span id="an_2683"></span> And was al his chiere, as in his herte.  
<span id="an_2684"></span> Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,  
<span id="an_2685"></span> From Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne,  
<span id="an_2686"></span> For which his hors for fere gan to turne,  
<span id="an_2687"></span> And leep aside, and foundred as he leep;  
<span id="an_2688"></span> And er that Arcite may taken keep,  
<span id="an_2689"></span> He pighte hym on the pomel of his heed,

<span id="an_2692"></span> As blak he lay as any cole or crowe,  
<span id="an_2693"></span> So was the blood yronnen in his face.  
<span id="an_2694"></span> Anon he was yborn out of the place,  
<span id="an_2695"></span> With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.  
<span id="an_2696"></span> Tho was he korven out of his harneys  
<span id="an_2697"></span> And in a bed ybrought ful faire and blyve,  
<span id="an_2698"></span> For he was yet in memorie and alyve,  
<span id="an_2699"></span> And alwey criynge after Emelye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2700">2700</span></span> Duc

<span id="an_2707"></span> And of another thyng they weren as fayn,

<span id="an_2716"></span> Conforteth and honoureth every man,  
<span id="an_2717"></span> And made revel al the longe nyght

<span id="an_2736"></span> And fully heeld a feeste dayes three,  
<span id="an_2737"></span> And conveyed the kynges worthily  
<span id="an_2738"></span> Out of his toun a journee largely.  
<span id="an_2739"></span> And hoom wente every man the righte way.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2740">2740</span></span> Ther was

<span id="an_2741"></span> Of this bataille I wol namoore endite,

<span id="an_2743"></span> Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the soore

<span id="an_2757"></span> Al is tobrosten thilke regioun;  
<span id="an_2758"></span> Nature hath now no dominacioun.  
<span id="an_2759"></span> And certeinly, ther Nature wol nat wirche,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2760">2760</span></span> Fare wel

<span id="an_2761"></span> This al and som, that Arcita moot dye;  
<span id="an_2762"></span> For which he sendeth after Emelye,  
<span id="an_2763"></span> And Palamon, that was his cosyn deere.  
<span id="an_2764"></span> Thanne seyde he thus, as ye shal after
heere:  
<span id="an_2765"></span> "Naught may the woful spirit in myn herte  
<span id="an_2766"></span> Declare o point of alle my sorwes smerte  
<span id="an_2767"></span> To yow, my lady, that I love moost,  
<span id="an_2768"></span> But I biquethe the servyce of my goost  
<span id="an_2769"></span> To yow aboven every creature,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2770">2770</span></span> Syn that my

<span id="an_2771"></span> Allas, the wo! Allas, the peynes stronge,  
<span id="an_2772"></span> That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!  
<span id="an_2773"></span> Allas, the deeth! Allas, myn Emelye!  
<span id="an_2774"></span> Allas, departynge of oure compaignye!

<span id="an_2776"></span> Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf!  
<span id="an_2777"></span> What is this world? What asketh men to

<span id="an_2778"></span> Now with his love, now in his colde grave  
<span id="an_2779"></span> Allone, withouten any compaignye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2780">2780</span></span> Fare wel,

<span id="an_2781"></span> And softe taak me in youre armes tweye,

<span id="an_2783"></span> "I have heer with my cosyn Palamon  
<span id="an_2784"></span> Had strif and rancour many a day agon  
<span id="an_2785"></span> For love of yow, and for my jalousye.  
<span id="an_2786"></span> And Juppiter so wys my soule gye,  
<span id="an_2787"></span> To speken of a servaunt proprely,  
<span id="an_2788"></span> With alle circumstances trewely --  
<span id="an_2789"></span> That is to seyen, trouthe, honour,

<span id="an_2796"></span> And if that evere ye shul ben a wyf,  
<span id="an_2797"></span> Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man."  
<span id="an_2798"></span> And with that word his speche faille gan,  
<span id="an_2799"></span> For from his feet up to his brest was come  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2800">2800</span></span> The coold
of deeth, that hadde hym overcome,  
<span id="an_2801"></span> And yet mooreover, for in his armes two  
<span id="an_2802"></span> The vital strengthe is lost and al ago.  
<span id="an_2803"></span> Oonly the intellect, withouten moore,  
<span id="an_2804"></span> That dwelled in his herte syk and soore,  
<span id="an_2805"></span> Gan faillen whan the herte felte deeth.  
<span id="an_2806"></span> Dusked his eyen two, and failled breeth,  
<span id="an_2807"></span> But on his lady yet caste he his ye;  
<span id="an_2808"></span> His laste word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"  
<span id="an_2809"></span> His spirit chaunged hous and wente ther,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2810">2810</span></span> As I cam

<span id="an_2811"></span> Therfore I stynte; I nam no divinistre;

<span id="an_2815"></span> Arcite is coold, ther Mars his soule gye!  
<span id="an_2816"></span> Now wol I speken forth of Emelye.  
<span id="an_2817"></span> Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon,  
<span id="an_2818"></span> And Theseus his suster took anon

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2820">2820</span></span> What
helpeth it to tarien forth the day  
<span id="an_2821"></span> To tellen how she weep bothe eve and morwe?  
<span id="an_2822"></span> For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,

<span id="an_2824"></span> That for the moore part they sorwen so,  
<span id="an_2825"></span> Or ellis fallen in swich maladye  
<span id="an_2826"></span> That at the laste certeinly they dye.  
<span id="an_2827"></span> Infinite been the sorwes and the teeres  
<span id="an_2828"></span> Of olde folk and folk of tendre yeeres  
<span id="an_2829"></span> In al the toun for deeth of this Theban.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2830">2830</span></span> For hym
ther wepeth bothe child and man;  
<span id="an_2831"></span> So greet wepyng was ther noon, certayn,  
<span id="an_2832"></span> Whan Ector was ybroght, al fressh yslayn,  
<span id="an_2833"></span> To Troye. Allas, the pitee that was ther,  
<span id="an_2834"></span> Cracchynge of chekes, rentynge eek of heer.  
<span id="an_2835"></span> "Why woldestow be deed," thise wommen crye,  
<span id="an_2836"></span> "And haddest gold ynough, and Emelye?"  
<span id="an_2837"></span> No man myghte gladen Theseus,  
<span id="an_2838"></span> Savynge his olde fader Egeus,  
<span id="an_2839"></span> That knew this worldes transmutacioun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2840">2840</span></span> As he hadde
seyn it chaunge bothe up and doun,  
<span id="an_2841"></span> Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse,  
<span id="an_2842"></span> And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse.  
<span id="an_2843"></span> "Right as ther dyed nevere man," quod he,  
<span id="an_2844"></span> "That he ne lyvede in erthe in some degree,  
<span id="an_2845"></span> Right so ther lyvede never man," he seyde,  
<span id="an_2846"></span> "In al this world, that som tyme he ne

<span id="an_2847"></span> This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo,  
<span id="an_2848"></span> And we been pilgrymes, passynge to and fro.  
<span id="an_2849"></span> Deeth is an ende of every worldly soore."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2850">2850</span></span> And over al
this yet seyde he muchel moore  
<span id="an_2851"></span> To this effect, ful wisely to enhorte  
<span id="an_2852"></span> The peple that they sholde hem reconforte.  
<span id="an_2853"></span> Duc Theseus, with al his bisy cure,

<span id="an_2855"></span> Of goode Arcite may best ymaked be,  
<span id="an_2856"></span> And eek moost honurable in his degree.  
<span id="an_2857"></span> And at the laste he took conclusioun  
<span id="an_2858"></span> That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun  
<span id="an_2859"></span> Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2860">2860</span></span> That in

<span id="an_2861"></span> Ther as he hadde his amorouse desires,  
<span id="an_2862"></span> His compleynte, and for love his hoote

<span id="an_2863"></span> He wolde make a fyr in which the office  
<span id="an_2864"></span> Funeral he myghte al accomplice.  
<span id="an_2865"></span> And leet comande anon to hakke and hewe

<span id="an_2868"></span> His officers with swifte feet they renne  
<span id="an_2869"></span> And ryde anon at his comandement.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2870">2870</span></span> And after
this, Theseus hath ysent  
<span id="an_2871"></span> After a beere, and it al overspradde  
<span id="an_2872"></span> With clooth of gold, the richeste that he

<span id="an_2873"></span> And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;  
<span id="an_2874"></span> Upon his hondes hadde he gloves white,  
<span id="an_2875"></span> Eek on his heed a coroune of laurer grene,

<span id="an_2878"></span> Therwith he weep that pitee was to heere.  
<span id="an_2879"></span> And for the peple sholde seen hym alle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2880">2880</span></span> Whan it was

<span id="an_2887"></span> In as muche as the servyce sholde be  
<span id="an_2888"></span> The moore noble and riche in his degree,  
<span id="an_2889"></span> Duc Theseus leet forth thre steedes brynge,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2890">2890</span></span> That

<span id="an_2963"></span> I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon  
<span id="an_2964"></span> Hoom til Atthenes, whan the pley is doon;  
<span id="an_2965"></span> But shortly to the point thanne wol I wende  
<span id="an_2966"></span> And maken of my longe tale an ende.  
<span id="an_2967"></span> By processe and by lengthe of certeyn
yeres,  
<span id="an_2968"></span> Al stynted is the moornynge and the teres  
<span id="an_2969"></span> Of Grekes, by oon general assent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2970">2970</span></span> Thanne
semed me ther was a parlement  
<span id="an_2971"></span> At Atthenes, upon certein pointz and caas;  
<span id="an_2972"></span> Among the whiche pointz yspoken was,  
<span id="an_2973"></span> To have with certein contrees alliaunce,  
<span id="an_2974"></span> And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.  
<span id="an_2975"></span> For which this noble Theseus anon  
<span id="an_2976"></span> Leet senden after gentil Palamon,  
<span id="an_2977"></span> Unwist of hym what was the cause and why,  
<span id="an_2978"></span> But in his blake clothes sorwefully  
<span id="an_2979"></span> He cam at his comandement in hye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2980">2980</span></span> Tho sente
Theseus for Emelye.  
<span id="an_2981"></span> Whan they were set, and hust was al the
place,  
<span id="an_2982"></span> And Theseus abiden hadde a space  
<span id="an_2983"></span> Er any word cam fram his wise brest,  
<span id="an_2984"></span> His eyen sette he ther as was his lest.  
<span id="an_2985"></span> And with a sad visage he siked stille,  
<span id="an_2986"></span> And after that right thus he seyde his
wille:  
<span id="an_2987"></span> "The Firste Moevere of the cause above,  
<span id="an_2988"></span> Whan he first made the faire cheyne of
love,  
<span id="an_2989"></span> Greet was th' effect, and heigh was his
entente.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2990">2990</span></span> Wel wiste
he why, and what thereof he mente,  
<span id="an_2991"></span> For with that faire cheyne of love he bond  
<span id="an_2992"></span> The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond  
<span id="an_2993"></span> In certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee.  
<span id="an_2994"></span> That same Prince and that Moevere," quod
he,  
<span id="an_2995"></span> "Hath stablissed in this wrecched world
adoun  
<span id="an_2996"></span> Certeyne dayes and duracioun  
<span id="an_2997"></span> To al that is engendred in this place,  
<span id="an_2998"></span> Over the whiche day they may nat pace,  
<span id="an_2999"></span> Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3000">3000</span></span> Ther nedeth
noght noon auctoritee t' allegge,  
<span id="an_3001"></span> For it is preeved by experience,  
<span id="an_3002"></span> But that me list declaren my sentence.  
<span id="an_3003"></span> Thanne may men by this ordre wel discerne  
<span id="an_3004"></span> That thilke Moevere stable is and eterne.  
<span id="an_3005"></span> Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,  
<span id="an_3006"></span> That every part dirryveth from his hool,  
<span id="an_3007"></span> For nature hath nat taken his bigynnyng  
<span id="an_3008"></span> Of no partie or cantel of a thyng,  
<span id="an_3009"></span> But of a thyng that parfit is and stable,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3010">3010</span></span> Descendynge
so til it be corrumpable.  
<span id="an_3011"></span> And therfore, of his wise purveiaunce,  
<span id="an_3012"></span> He hath so wel biset his ordinaunce  
<span id="an_3013"></span> That speces of thynges and progressiouns  
<span id="an_3014"></span> Shullen enduren by successiouns,  
<span id="an_3015"></span> And nat eterne, withouten any lye.  
<span id="an_3016"></span> This maystow understonde and seen at ye.  
<span id="an_3017"></span> "Loo the ook, that hath so long a
norisshynge  
<span id="an_3018"></span> From tyme that it first bigynneth to
sprynge,  
<span id="an_3019"></span> And hath so long a lif, as we may see,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3020">3020</span></span> Yet at the
laste wasted is the tree.  
<span id="an_3021"></span> "Considereth eek how that the harde stoon  
<span id="an_3022"></span> Under oure feet, on which we trede and
goon,  
<span id="an_3023"></span> Yet wasteth it as it lyth by the weye.  
<span id="an_3024"></span> The brode ryver somtyme wexeth dreye;  
<span id="an_3025"></span> The grete tounes se we wane and wende.  
<span id="an_3026"></span> Thanne may ye se that al this thyng hath
ende.  
<span id="an_3027"></span> "Of man and womman seen we wel also  
<span id="an_3028"></span> That nedes, in oon of thise termes two --  
<span id="an_3029"></span> This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3030">3030</span></span> He moot be
deed, the kyng as shal a page;  
<span id="an_3031"></span> Som in his bed, som in the depe see,  
<span id="an_3032"></span> Som in the large feeld, as men may see;  
<span id="an_3033"></span> Ther helpeth noght; al goth that ilke weye.  
<span id="an_3034"></span> Thanne may I seyn that al this thyng moot
deye.  
<span id="an_3035"></span> "What maketh this but Juppiter, the kyng,  
<span id="an_3036"></span> That is prince and cause of alle thyng,  
<span id="an_3037"></span> Convertynge al unto his propre welle  
<span id="an_3038"></span> From which it is dirryved, sooth to telle?  
<span id="an_3039"></span> And heer-agayns no creature on lyve,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3040">3040</span></span> Of no
degree, availleth for to stryve.  
<span id="an_3041"></span> "Thanne is it wysdom, as it thynketh me,  
<span id="an_3042"></span> To maken vertu of necessitee,  
<span id="an_3043"></span> And take it weel that we may nat eschue,  
<span id="an_3044"></span> And namely that to us alle is due.  
<span id="an_3045"></span> And whoso gruccheth ought, he dooth folye,  
<span id="an_3046"></span> And rebel is to hym that al may gye.  
<span id="an_3047"></span> And certeinly a man hath moost honour  
<span id="an_3048"></span> To dyen in his excellence and flour,  
<span id="an_3049"></span> Whan he is siker of his goode name;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3050">3050</span></span> Thanne hath
he doon his freend, ne hym, no shame.  
<span id="an_3051"></span> And gladder oghte his freend been of his
deeth,  
<span id="an_3052"></span> Whan with honour up yolden is his breeth,  
<span id="an_3053"></span> Than whan his name apalled is for age,  
<span id="an_3054"></span> For al forgeten is his vassellage.  
<span id="an_3055"></span> Thanne is it best, as for a worthy fame,  
<span id="an_3056"></span> To dyen whan that he is best of name.  
<span id="an_3057"></span> "The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.  
<span id="an_3058"></span> Why grucchen we, why have we hevynesse,  
<span id="an_3059"></span> That goode Arcite, of chivalrie flour,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3060">3060</span></span> Departed is
with duetee and honour  
<span id="an_3061"></span> Out of this foule prisoun of this lyf?  
<span id="an_3062"></span> Why grucchen heere his cosyn and his wyf  
<span id="an_3063"></span> Of his welfare, that loved hem so weel?  
<span id="an_3064"></span> Kan he hem thank? Nay, God woot, never a
deel,  
<span id="an_3065"></span> That both his soule and eek hemself
offende,  
<span id="an_3066"></span> And yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende.  
<span id="an_3067"></span> "What may I conclude of this longe serye,  
<span id="an_3068"></span> But after wo I rede us to be merye  
<span id="an_3069"></span> And thanken Juppiter of al his grace?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3070">3070</span></span> And er that
we departen from this place  
<span id="an_3071"></span> I rede that we make of sorwes two  
<span id="an_3072"></span> O parfit joye, lastynge everemo.  
<span id="an_3073"></span> And looketh now, wher moost sorwe is
herinne,  
<span id="an_3074"></span> Ther wol we first amenden and bigynne.  
<span id="an_3075"></span> "Suster," quod he, "this is my fulle
assent,  
<span id="an_3076"></span> With al th' avys heere of my parlement,  
<span id="an_3077"></span> That gentil Palamon, youre owene knyght,  
<span id="an_3078"></span> That serveth yow with wille, herte, and
myght,  
<span id="an_3079"></span> And ever hath doon syn ye first hym knewe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3080">3080</span></span> That ye
shul of youre grace upon hym rewe,  
<span id="an_3081"></span> And taken hym for housbonde and for lord.  
<span id="an_3082"></span> Lene me youre hond, for this is oure
accord.  
<span id="an_3083"></span> Lat se now of youre wommanly pitee.  
<span id="an_3084"></span> He is a kynges brother sone, pardee;  
<span id="an_3085"></span> And though he were a povre bacheler,  
<span id="an_3086"></span> Syn he hath served yow so many a yeer,  
<span id="an_3087"></span> And had for yow so greet adversitee,  
<span id="an_3088"></span> It moste been considered, leeveth me,  
<span id="an_3089"></span> For gentil mercy oghte to passen right."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3090">3090</span></span> Thanne
seyde he thus to Palamon the knight:  
<span id="an_3091"></span> "I trowe ther nedeth litel sermonyng  
<span id="an_3092"></span> To make yow assente to this thyng.  
<span id="an_3093"></span> Com neer, and taak youre lady by the hond."  
<span id="an_3094"></span> Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond  
<span id="an_3095"></span> That highte matrimoigne or mariage,  
<span id="an_3096"></span> By al the conseil and the baronage.  
<span id="an_3097"></span> And thus with alle blisse and melodye  
<span id="an_3098"></span> Hath Palamon ywedded Emelye.  
<span id="an_3099"></span> And God, that al this wyde world hath
wroght,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_3100">3100</span></span> Sende hym
his love that hath it deere aboght;  
<span id="an_3101"></span> For now is Palamon in alle wele,  
<span id="an_3102"></span> Lyvynge in blisse, in richesse, and in
heele,  
<span id="an_3103"></span> And Emelye hym loveth so tendrely,  
<span id="an_3104"></span> And he hire serveth so gentilly,  
<span id="an_3105"></span> That nevere was ther no word hem bitwene  
<span id="an_3106"></span> Of jalousie or any oother teene.  
<span id="an_3107"></span> Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye;  
<span id="an_3108"></span> And God save al this faire compaignye!
Amen.
