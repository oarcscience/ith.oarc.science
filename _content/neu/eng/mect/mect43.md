#### The Canterbury Tales

### The Canon's Yeoman's Tale

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_720">720</span></span> With this
Chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,  
<span id="an_721"></span> And of his science am I never the neer.  
<span id="an_722"></span> Al that I hadde I have lost therby,  
<span id="an_723"></span> And, God woot, so hath many mo than I.  
<span id="an_724"></span> Ther I was wont to be right fressh and gay  
<span id="an_725"></span> Of clothyng and of oother good array,  
<span id="an_726"></span> Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;  
<span id="an_727"></span> And wher my colour was bothe fressh and
reed,  
<span id="an_728"></span> Now is it wan and of a leden hewe --  
<span id="an_729"></span> Whoso it useth, soore shal he rewe! --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_730">730</span></span> And of my
swynk yet blered is myn ye.  
<span id="an_731"></span> Lo, which avantage is to multiplie!  
<span id="an_732"></span> That slidynge science hath me maad so bare  
<span id="an_733"></span> That I have no good, wher that evere I fare;  
<span id="an_734"></span> And yet I am endetted so therby  
<span id="an_735"></span> Of gold that I have borwed, trewely,  
<span id="an_736"></span> That whil I lyve I shal it quite nevere.  
<span id="an_737"></span> Lat every man be war by me for evere!  
<span id="an_738"></span> What maner man that casteth hym therto,  
<span id="an_739"></span> If he continue, I holde his thrift ydo.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_740">740</span></span> For so helpe
me God, therby shal he nat wynne,  
<span id="an_741"></span> But empte his purs and make his wittes
thynne.  
<span id="an_742"></span> And whan he thurgh his madnesse and folye  
<span id="an_743"></span> Hath lost his owene good thurgh jupartye,  
<span id="an_744"></span> Thanne he exciteth oother folk therto,  
<span id="an_745"></span> To lesen hir good as he hymself hath do.  
<span id="an_746"></span> For unto shrewes joye it is and ese  
<span id="an_747"></span> To have hir felawes in peyne and disese.  
<span id="an_748"></span> Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk.  
<span id="an_749"></span> Of that no charge; I wol speke of oure werk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_750">750</span></span> Whan we been
there as we shul exercise  
<span id="an_751"></span> Oure elvysshe craft, we semen wonder wise,  
<span id="an_752"></span> Oure termes been so clergial and so queynte.  
<span id="an_753"></span> I blowe the fir til that myn herte feynte.  
<span id="an_754"></span> What sholde I tellen ech proporcion  
<span id="an_755"></span> Of thynges whiche that we werche upon --  
<span id="an_756"></span> As on fyve or sixe ounces, may wel be,  
<span id="an_757"></span> Of silver, or som oother quantitee --  
<span id="an_758"></span> And bisye me to telle yow the names  
<span id="an_759"></span> Of orpyment, brent bones, iren squames,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_760">760</span></span> That into
poudre grounden been ful smal;  
<span id="an_761"></span> And in an erthen pot how put is al,  
<span id="an_762"></span> And salt yput in, and also papeer,  
<span id="an_763"></span> Biforn thise poudres that I speke of heer;  
<span id="an_764"></span> And wel ycovered with a lampe of glas;  
<span id="an_765"></span> And of muche oother thyng which that ther
was;  
<span id="an_766"></span> And of the pot and glasses enlutyng  
<span id="an_767"></span> That of the eyr myghte passe out nothyng;  
<span id="an_768"></span> And of the esy fir, and smart also,  
<span id="an_769"></span> Which that was maad, and of the care and wo  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_770">770</span></span> That we hadde
in oure matires sublymyng,  
<span id="an_771"></span> And in amalgamyng and calcenyng  
<span id="an_772"></span> Of quyksilver, yclept mercurie crude?  
<span id="an_773"></span> For alle oure sleightes we kan nat conclude.  
<span id="an_774"></span> Oure orpyment and sublymed mercurie,  
<span id="an_775"></span> Oure grounden litarge eek on the porfurie,  
<span id="an_776"></span> Of ech of thise of ounces a certeyn --  
<span id="an_777"></span> Noght helpeth us; oure labour is in veyn.  
<span id="an_778"></span> Ne eek oure spirites ascencioun,  
<span id="an_779"></span> Ne oure materes that lyen al fix adoun,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_780">780</span></span> Mowe in oure
werkyng no thyng us availle,  
<span id="an_781"></span> For lost is al oure labour and travaille;  
<span id="an_782"></span> And al the cost, a twenty devel waye,  
<span id="an_783"></span> Is lost also, which we upon it laye.  
<span id="an_784"></span> Ther is also ful many another thyng  
<span id="an_785"></span> That is unto oure craft apertenyng.  
<span id="an_786"></span> Though I by ordre hem nat reherce kan,  
<span id="an_787"></span> By cause that I am a lewed man,  
<span id="an_788"></span> Yet wol I telle hem as they come to mynde,  
<span id="an_789"></span> Thogh I ne kan nat sette hem in hir kynde:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_790">790</span></span> As boole
armonyak, verdegrees, boras,  
<span id="an_791"></span> And sondry vessels maad of erthe and glas,  
<span id="an_792"></span> Oure urynales and oure descensories,  
<span id="an_793"></span> Violes, crosletz, and sublymatories,  
<span id="an_794"></span> Cucurbites and alambikes eek,  
<span id="an_795"></span> And othere swiche, deere ynough a leek --  
<span id="an_796"></span> Nat nedeth it for to reherce hem alle --  
<span id="an_797"></span> Watres rubifiyng, and boles galle,  
<span id="an_798"></span> Arsenyk, sal armonyak, and brymstoon;  
<span id="an_799"></span> And herbes koude I telle eek many oon,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_800">800</span></span> As egremoyne,
valerian, and lunarie,  
<span id="an_801"></span> And othere swiche, if that me liste tarie;  
<span id="an_802"></span> Oure lampes brennyng bothe nyght and day,  
<span id="an_803"></span> To brynge aboute oure purpos, if we may;  
<span id="an_804"></span> Oure fourneys eek of calcinacioun,  
<span id="an_805"></span> And of watres albificacioun;  
<span id="an_806"></span> Unslekked lym, chalk, and gleyre of an ey,  
<span id="an_807"></span> Poudres diverse, asshes, donge, pisse, and
cley,  
<span id="an_808"></span> Cered pokkets, sal peter, vitriole,  
<span id="an_809"></span> And diverse fires maad of wode and cole;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_810">810</span></span> Sal tartre,
alkaly, and sal preparat,  
<span id="an_811"></span> And combust materes and coagulat;  
<span id="an_812"></span> Cley maad with hors or mannes heer, and
oille  
<span id="an_813"></span> Of tartre, alum glas, berme, wort, and

<span id="an_814"></span> Resalgar, and oure materes enbibyng,  
<span id="an_815"></span> And eek of oure materes encorporyng,  
<span id="an_816"></span> And of oure silver citrinacioun,  
<span id="an_817"></span> Oure cementyng and fermentacioun,  
<span id="an_818"></span> Oure yngottes, testes, and many mo.  
<span id="an_819"></span> I wol yow telle, as was me taught also,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_820">820</span></span> The foure
spirites and the bodies sevene,  
<span id="an_821"></span> By ordre, as ofte I herde my lord hem
nevene.  
<span id="an_822"></span> The firste spirit quyksilver called is,  
<span id="an_823"></span> The seconde orpyment, the thridde, ywis,  
<span id="an_824"></span> Sal armonyak, and the ferthe brymstoon.  
<span id="an_825"></span> The bodyes sevene eek, lo, hem heere anoon:  
<span id="an_826"></span> Sol gold is, and Luna silver we threpe,  
<span id="an_827"></span> Mars iren, Mercurie quyksilver we clepe,  
<span id="an_828"></span> Saturnus leed, and Juppiter is tyn,  
<span id="an_829"></span> And Venus coper, by my fader kyn!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_830">830</span></span> This cursed
craft whoso wole excercise,  
<span id="an_831"></span> He shal no good han that hym may suffise,  
<span id="an_832"></span> For al the good he spendeth theraboute  
<span id="an_833"></span> He lese shal; therof have I no doute.  
<span id="an_834"></span> Whoso that listeth outen his folie,  
<span id="an_835"></span> Lat hym come forth and lerne multiplie;  
<span id="an_836"></span> And every man that oght hath in his cofre,  
<span id="an_837"></span> Lat hym appiere and wexe a philosophre.  
<span id="an_838"></span> Ascaunce that craft is so light to leere?  
<span id="an_839"></span> Nay, nay, God woot, al be he monk or frere,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_840">840</span></span> Preest or
chanoun, or any oother wyght,  
<span id="an_841"></span> Though he sitte at his book bothe day and
nyght  
<span id="an_842"></span> In lernyng of this elvysshe nyce loore,  
<span id="an_843"></span> Al is in veyn, and parde, muchel moore.  
<span id="an_844"></span> To lerne a lewed man this subtiltee --  
<span id="an_845"></span> Fy! Spek nat therof, for it wol nat bee.  
<span id="an_846"></span> And konne he letterure or konne he noon,  
<span id="an_847"></span> As in effect, he shal fynde it al oon.  
<span id="an_848"></span> For bothe two, by my savacioun,  
<span id="an_849"></span> Concluden in multiplicacioun  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_850">850</span></span> Ylike wel,
whan they han al ydo;  
<span id="an_851"></span> This is to seyn, they faillen bothe two.  
<span id="an_852"></span> Yet forgat I to maken rehersaille  
<span id="an_853"></span> Of watres corosif, and of lymaille,  
<span id="an_854"></span> And of bodies mollificacioun,  
<span id="an_855"></span> And also of hire induracioun;  
<span id="an_856"></span> Oilles, ablucions, and metal fusible --  
<span id="an_857"></span> To tellen al wolde passen any bible  
<span id="an_858"></span> That owher is; wherfore, as for the beste,  
<span id="an_859"></span> Of alle thise names now wol I me reste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_860">860</span></span> For, as I
trowe, I have yow toold ynowe  
<span id="an_861"></span> To reyse a feend, al looke he never so rowe.  
<span id="an_862"></span> A! Nay! Lat be; the philosophres stoon,  
<span id="an_863"></span> Elixer clept, we sechen faste echoon;  
<span id="an_864"></span> For hadde we hym, thanne were we siker ynow.  
<span id="an_865"></span> But unto God of hevene I make avow,  
<span id="an_866"></span> For al oure craft, whan we han al ydo,  
<span id="an_867"></span> And al oure sleighte, he wol nat come us to.  
<span id="an_868"></span> He hath ymaad us spenden muchel good,  
<span id="an_869"></span> For sorwe of which almoost we wexen wood,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_870">870</span></span> But that good
hope crepeth in oure herte,  
<span id="an_871"></span> Supposynge evere, though we sore smerte,  
<span id="an_872"></span> To be releeved by hym afterward.  
<span id="an_873"></span> Swich supposyng and hope is sharp and hard;  
<span id="an_874"></span> I warne yow wel, it is to seken evere.  
<span id="an_875"></span> That futur temps hath maad men to dissevere,  
<span id="an_876"></span> In trust therof, from al that evere they
hadde.  
<span id="an_877"></span> Yet of that art they kan nat wexen sadde,  
<span id="an_878"></span> For unto hem it is a bitter sweete --  
<span id="an_879"></span> So semeth it -- for nadde they but a sheete  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_880">880</span></span> Which that
they myghte wrappe hem inne a-nyght,  
<span id="an_881"></span> And a brat to walken inne by daylyght,  
<span id="an_882"></span> They wolde hem selle and spenden on this
craft.  
<span id="an_883"></span> They kan nat stynte til no thyng be laft.  
<span id="an_884"></span> And everemoore, where that evere they goon,  
<span id="an_885"></span> Men may hem knowe by smel of brymstoon.  
<span id="an_886"></span> For al the world they stynken as a goot;  
<span id="an_887"></span> Hir savour is so rammyssh and so hoot  
<span id="an_888"></span> That though a man from hem a mile be,  
<span id="an_889"></span> The savour wole infecte hym, trusteth me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_890">890</span></span> Lo, thus by
smellyng and threedbare array,  
<span id="an_891"></span> If that men liste, this folk they knowe may.  
<span id="an_892"></span> And if a man wole aske hem pryvely  
<span id="an_893"></span> Why they been clothed so unthriftily,  
<span id="an_894"></span> They right anon wol rownen in his ere,  
<span id="an_895"></span> And seyn that if that they espied were,  
<span id="an_896"></span> Men wolde hem slee by cause of hir science.  
<span id="an_897"></span> Lo, thus this folk bitrayen innocence!  
<span id="an_898"></span> Passe over this; I go my tale unto.  
<span id="an_899"></span> Er that the pot be on the fir ydo,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_900">900</span></span> Of metals
with a certeyn quantitee,  
<span id="an_901"></span> My lord hem tempreth, and no man but he --  
<span id="an_902"></span> Now he is goon, I dar seyn boldely --  
<span id="an_903"></span> For, as men seyn, he kan doon craftily.  
<span id="an_904"></span> Algate I woot wel he hath swich a name;  
<span id="an_905"></span> And yet ful ofte he renneth in a blame.  
<span id="an_906"></span> And wite ye how? Ful ofte it happeth so  
<span id="an_907"></span> The pot tobreketh, and farewel, al is go!  
<span id="an_908"></span> Thise metals been of so greet violence  
<span id="an_909"></span> Oure walles mowe nat make hem resistence,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_910">910</span></span> But if they
weren wroght of lym and stoon;  
<span id="an_911"></span> They percen so, and thurgh the wal they
goon.  
<span id="an_912"></span> And somme of hem synken into the ground --  
<span id="an_913"></span> Thus han we lost by tymes many a pound --  
<span id="an_914"></span> And somme are scatered al the floor aboute;  
<span id="an_915"></span> Somme lepe into the roof. Withouten doute,  
<span id="an_916"></span> Though that the feend noght in oure sighte hym
shewe,  
<span id="an_917"></span> I trowe he with us be, that ilke shrewe!  
<span id="an_918"></span> In helle, where that he is lord and sire,  
<span id="an_919"></span> Nis ther moore wo, ne moore rancour ne ire.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_920">920</span></span> Whan that
oure pot is broke, as I have sayd,  
<span id="an_921"></span> Every man chit and halt hym yvele apayd.  
<span id="an_922"></span> Somme seyde it was long on the fir makyng;  
<span id="an_923"></span> Somme seyde nay, it was on the blowyng --  
<span id="an_924"></span> Thanne was I fered, for that was myn office.  
<span id="an_925"></span> "Straw!" quod the thridde, "ye been lewed and
nyce.  
<span id="an_926"></span> It was nat tempred as it oghte be."  
<span id="an_927"></span> "Nay," quod the fourthe, "stynt and herkne
me.  
<span id="an_928"></span> By cause oure fir ne was nat maad of beech,  
<span id="an_929"></span> That is the cause and oother noon, so thee
'ch!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_930">930</span></span> I kan nat
telle wheron it was long,  
<span id="an_931"></span> But wel I woot greet strif is us among.  
<span id="an_932"></span> "What," quod my lord, "ther is namoore to
doone;  
<span id="an_933"></span> Of thise perils I wol be war eftsoone.  
<span id="an_934"></span> I am right siker that the pot was crased.  
<span id="an_935"></span> Be as be may, be ye no thyng amased;  
<span id="an_936"></span> As usage is, lat swepe the floor as swithe,  
<span id="an_937"></span> Plukke up youre hertes and beeth glad and
blithe."  
<span id="an_938"></span> The mullok on an heep ysweped was,  
<span id="an_939"></span> And on the floor ycast a canevas,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_940">940</span></span> And al this
mullok in a syve ythrowe,  
<span id="an_941"></span> And sifted, and ypiked many a throwe.  
<span id="an_942"></span> "Pardee," quod oon, "somwhat of oure metal  
<span id="an_943"></span> Yet is ther heere, though that we han nat
al.  
<span id="an_944"></span> And though this thyng myshapped have as now,  
<span id="an_945"></span> Another tyme it may be well ynow.  
<span id="an_946"></span> Us moste putte oure good in aventure.  
<span id="an_947"></span> A marchant, pardee, may nat ay endure,  
<span id="an_948"></span> Trusteth me wel, in his prosperitee.  
<span id="an_949"></span> Somtyme his good is drowned in the see,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_950">950</span></span> And somtyme
comth it sauf unto the londe."  
<span id="an_951"></span> "Pees!" quod my lord, "the nexte tyme I wol
fonde  
<span id="an_952"></span> To bryngen oure craft al in another plite,  
<span id="an_953"></span> And but I do, sires, lat me han the wite.  
<span id="an_954"></span> Ther was defaute in somwhat, wel I woot."  
<span id="an_955"></span> Another seyde the fir was over-hoot --  
<span id="an_956"></span> But, be it hoot or coold, I dar seye this,  
<span id="an_957"></span> That we concluden everemoore amys.  
<span id="an_958"></span> We faille of that which that we wolden have,  
<span id="an_959"></span> And in oure madnesse everemoore we rave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_960">960</span></span> And whan we
been togidres everichoon,  
<span id="an_961"></span> Every man semeth a Salomon.  
<span id="an_962"></span> But al thyng which that shineth as the gold  
<span id="an_963"></span> Nis nat gold, as that I have herd told;  
<span id="an_964"></span> Ne every appul that is fair at eye  
<span id="an_965"></span> Ne is nat good, what so men clappe or crye.  
<span id="an_966"></span> Right so, lo, fareth it amonges us:  
<span id="an_967"></span> He that semeth the wiseste, by Jhesus,  
<span id="an_968"></span> Is moost fool, whan it cometh to the preef;  
<span id="an_969"></span> And he that semeth trewest is a theef.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_970">970</span></span> That shul ye
knowe, er that I fro yow wende,  
<span id="an_971"></span> By that I of my tale have maad an ende.  
<span id="an_972"></span> Ther is a chanoun of religioun  
<span id="an_973"></span> Amonges us, wolde infecte al a toun,  
<span id="an_974"></span> Thogh it as greet were as was Nynyvee,  
<span id="an_975"></span> Rome, Alisaundre, Troye, and othere three.  
<span id="an_976"></span> His sleightes and his infinite falsnesse  
<span id="an_977"></span> Ther koude no man writen, as I gesse,  
<span id="an_978"></span> Though that he myghte lyve a thousand yeer.  
<span id="an_979"></span> In al this world of falshede nis his peer,

<span id="an_983"></span> That he wol make hym doten anonright,  
<span id="an_984"></span> But it a feend be, as hymselven is.  
<span id="an_985"></span> Ful many a man hath he bigiled er this,  
<span id="an_986"></span> And wole, if that he lyve may a while;  
<span id="an_987"></span> And yet men ride and goon ful many a mile

<span id="an_989"></span> Noght knowynge of his false governaunce.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_990">990</span></span> And if yow
list to yeve me audience,  
<span id="an_991"></span> I wol it tellen heere in youre presence.  
<span id="an_992"></span> But worshipful chanons religious,  
<span id="an_993"></span> Ne demeth nat that I sclaundre youre hous,  
<span id="an_994"></span> Although that my tale of a chanoun bee.  
<span id="an_995"></span> Of every ordre som shrewe is, pardee,  
<span id="an_996"></span> And God forbede that al a compaignye  
<span id="an_997"></span> Sholde rewe o singuleer mannes folye.  
<span id="an_998"></span> To sclaundre yow is no thyng myn entente,  
<span id="an_999"></span> But to correcten that is mys I mente.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000">1000</span></span> This tale
was nat oonly toold for yow,  
<span id="an_1001"></span> But eek for othere mo; ye woot wel how  
<span id="an_1002"></span> That among Cristes apostelles twelve  
<span id="an_1003"></span> Ther nas no traytour but Judas hymselve.  
<span id="an_1004"></span> Thanne why sholde al the remenant have a
blame  
<span id="an_1005"></span> That giltlees were? By yow I seye the same,  
<span id="an_1006"></span> Save oonly this, if ye wol herkne me:  
<span id="an_1007"></span> If any Judas in youre covent be,  
<span id="an_1008"></span> Remoeveth hym bitymes, I yow rede,  
<span id="an_1009"></span> If shame or los may causen any drede.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1010">1010</span></span> And beeth
no thyng displesed, I yow preye,  
<span id="an_1011"></span> But in this cas herkneth what I shal seye.  
<span id="an_1012"></span> In Londoun was a preest, an annueleer,  
<span id="an_1013"></span> That therinne dwelled hadde many a yeer,  
<span id="an_1014"></span> Which was so plesaunt and so servysable  
<span id="an_1015"></span> Unto the wyf, where as he was at table,  
<span id="an_1016"></span> That she wolde suffre hym no thyng for to
paye  
<span id="an_1017"></span> For bord ne clothyng, wente he never so
gaye,  
<span id="an_1018"></span> And spendyng silver hadde he right ynow.  
<span id="an_1019"></span> Therof no fors; I wol procede as now,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1020">1020</span></span> And telle

<span id="an_1021"></span> That broghte this preest to confusioun.  
<span id="an_1022"></span> This false chanon cam upon a day  
<span id="an_1023"></span> Unto this preestes chambre, wher he lay,  
<span id="an_1024"></span> Bisechynge hym to lene hym a certeyn  
<span id="an_1025"></span> Of gold, and he wolde quite it hym ageyn.

<span id="an_1028"></span> And if so be that thow me fynde fals,  
<span id="an_1029"></span> Another day do hange me by the hals!"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1030">1030</span></span> This preest
hym took a marc, and that as swithe,  
<span id="an_1031"></span> And this chanoun hym thanked ofte sithe,  
<span id="an_1032"></span> And took his leve, and wente forth his
weye,  
<span id="an_1033"></span> And at the thridde day broghte his moneye,  
<span id="an_1034"></span> And to the preest he took his gold agayn,  
<span id="an_1035"></span> Wherof this preest was wonder glad and
fayn.  
<span id="an_1036"></span> "Certes," quod he, "no thyng anoyeth me  
<span id="an_1037"></span> To lene a man a noble, or two, or thre,

<span id="an_1044"></span> Trouthe is a thyng that I wol evere kepe

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1160">1160</span></span> Out of his

<span id="an_1237"></span> Thow fynde shalt ther silver, as I hope."  
<span id="an_1238"></span> What, devel of helle, sholde it elles be?  
<span id="an_1239"></span> Shaving of silver silver is, pardee!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1240">1240</span></span> He putte
his hand in and took up a teyne  
<span id="an_1241"></span> Of silver fyn, and glad in every veyne  
<span id="an_1242"></span> Was this preest, whan he saugh it was so.  
<span id="an_1243"></span> "Goddes blessyng, and his moodres also,  
<span id="an_1244"></span> And alle halwes, have ye, sire chanoun,"  
<span id="an_1245"></span> Seyde the preest, "and I hir malisoun,  
<span id="an_1246"></span> But, and ye vouche-sauf to techen me  
<span id="an_1247"></span> This noble craft and this subtilitee,  
<span id="an_1248"></span> I wol be youre in al that evere I may."  
<span id="an_1249"></span> Quod the chanoun, "Yet wol I make assay  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1250">1250</span></span> The seconde
tyme, that ye may taken heede  
<span id="an_1251"></span> And been expert of this, and in youre neede  
<span id="an_1252"></span> Another day assaye in myn absence  
<span id="an_1253"></span> This disciplyne and this crafty science.  
<span id="an_1254"></span> Lat take another ounce," quod he tho,  
<span id="an_1255"></span> "Of quyksilver, withouten wordes mo,  
<span id="an_1256"></span> And do therwith as ye han doon er this  
<span id="an_1257"></span> With that oother, which that now silver
is."  
<span id="an_1258"></span> This preest hym bisieth in al that he kan  
<span id="an_1259"></span> To doon as this chanoun, this cursed man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1260">1260</span></span> Comanded
hym, and faste blew the fir,  
<span id="an_1261"></span> For to come to th' effect of his desir.  
<span id="an_1262"></span> And this chanon, right in the meene while,  
<span id="an_1263"></span> Al redy was this preest eft to bigile,  
<span id="an_1264"></span> And for a contenaunce in his hand he bar  
<span id="an_1265"></span> An holwe stikke -- taak kep and be war! --  
<span id="an_1266"></span> In the ende of which an ounce, and namoore,  
<span id="an_1267"></span> Of silver lemaille put was, as bifore  
<span id="an_1268"></span> Was in his cole, and stopped with wex weel  
<span id="an_1269"></span> For to kepe in his lemaille every deel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1270">1270</span></span> And whil
this preest was in his bisynesse,  
<span id="an_1271"></span> This chanoun with his stikke gan hym dresse  
<span id="an_1272"></span> To hym anon, and his poudre caste in  
<span id="an_1273"></span> As he dide er -- the devel out of his skyn  
<span id="an_1274"></span> Hym terve, I pray to God, for his falshede!  
<span id="an_1275"></span> For he was evere fals in thoght and dede --  
<span id="an_1276"></span> And with this stikke, above the crosselet,  
<span id="an_1277"></span> That was ordeyned with that false jet,  
<span id="an_1278"></span> He stired the coles til relente gan  
<span id="an_1279"></span> The wex agayn the fir, as every man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1280">1280</span></span> But it a
fool be, woot wel it moot nede,  
<span id="an_1281"></span> And al that in the stikke was out yede,  
<span id="an_1282"></span> And in the crosselet hastily it fel.  
<span id="an_1283"></span> Now, good sires, what wol ye bet than wel?  
<span id="an_1284"></span> Whan that this preest thus was bigiled
ageyn,  
<span id="an_1285"></span> Supposynge noght but treuthe, sooth to
seyn,  
<span id="an_1286"></span> He was so glad that I kan nat expresse  
<span id="an_1287"></span> In no manere his myrthe and his gladnesse;  
<span id="an_1288"></span> And to the chanoun he profred eftsoone  
<span id="an_1289"></span> Body and good. "Ye," quod the chanoun
soone,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1290">1290</span></span> "Though
poure I be, crafty thou shalt me fynde.  
<span id="an_1291"></span> I warne thee, yet is ther moore bihynde.  
<span id="an_1292"></span> Is ther any coper herinne?" seyde he.  
<span id="an_1293"></span> "Ye," quod the preest, "sire, I trowe wel
ther be."  
<span id="an_1294"></span> "Elles go bye us som, and that as swithe;  
<span id="an_1295"></span> Now, goode sire, go forth thy wey and hy
the."  
<span id="an_1296"></span> He wente his wey, and with the coper cam,  
<span id="an_1297"></span> And this chanon it in his handes nam,  
<span id="an_1298"></span> And of that coper weyed out but an ounce.  
<span id="an_1299"></span> Al to symple is my tonge to pronounce,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300">1300</span></span> As ministre
of my wit, the doublenesse  
<span id="an_1301"></span> Of this chanoun, roote of alle cursednesse!  
<span id="an_1302"></span> He semed freendly to hem that knewe hym
noght,  
<span id="an_1303"></span> But he was feendly bothe in werk and
thoght.  
<span id="an_1304"></span> It weerieth me to telle of his falsnesse,  
<span id="an_1305"></span> And nathelees yet wol I it expresse,  
<span id="an_1306"></span> To th' entente that men may be war therby,  
<span id="an_1307"></span> And for noon oother cause, trewely.  
<span id="an_1308"></span> He putte this ounce of coper in the
crosselet,  
<span id="an_1309"></span> And on the fir as swithe he hath it set,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1310">1310</span></span> And caste
in poudre, and made the preest to blowe,  
<span id="an_1311"></span> And in his werkyng for to stoupe lowe,  
<span id="an_1312"></span> As he dide er -- and al nas but a jape;  
<span id="an_1313"></span> Right as hym liste, the preest he made his
ape!  
<span id="an_1314"></span> And afterward in the ingot he it caste,  
<span id="an_1315"></span> And in the panne putte it at the laste  
<span id="an_1316"></span> Of water, and in he putte his owene hand,  
<span id="an_1317"></span> And in his sleve (as ye biforen-hand  
<span id="an_1318"></span> Herde me telle) he hadde a silver teyne.  
<span id="an_1319"></span> He slyly took it out, this cursed heyne,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1320">1320</span></span> Unwityng
this preest of his false craft,  
<span id="an_1321"></span> And in the pannes botme he hath it laft;  
<span id="an_1322"></span> And in the water rombled to and fro,  
<span id="an_1323"></span> And wonder pryvely took up also  
<span id="an_1324"></span> The coper teyne, noght knowynge this
preest,  
<span id="an_1325"></span> And hidde it, and hym hente by the breest,  
<span id="an_1326"></span> And to hym spak, and thus seyde in his
game:  
<span id="an_1327"></span> "Stoupeth adoun. By God, ye be to blame!  
<span id="an_1328"></span> Helpeth me now, as I dide yow whileer;  
<span id="an_1329"></span> Putte in youre hand, and looketh what is
theer."  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1330">1330</span></span> This preest
took up this silver teyne anon,  
<span id="an_1331"></span> And thanne seyde the chanoun, "Lat us gon  
<span id="an_1332"></span> With thise thre teynes, whiche that we han
wroght,  
<span id="an_1333"></span> To som goldsmyth and wite if they been
oght,  
<span id="an_1334"></span> For, by my feith, I nolde, for myn hood,  
<span id="an_1335"></span> But if that they were silver fyn and good,  
<span id="an_1336"></span> And that as swithe preeved it shal bee."  
<span id="an_1337"></span> Unto the goldsmyth with thise teynes three  
<span id="an_1338"></span> They wente and putte thise teynes in assay  
<span id="an_1339"></span> To fir and hamer; myghte no man seye nay,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1340">1340</span></span> But that
they weren as hem oghte be.  
<span id="an_1341"></span> This sotted preest, who was gladder than
he?  
<span id="an_1342"></span> Was nevere brid gladder agayn the day,  
<span id="an_1343"></span> Ne nyghtyngale, in the sesoun of May,  
<span id="an_1344"></span> Was nevere noon that luste bet to synge;  
<span id="an_1345"></span> Ne lady lustier in carolynge,  
<span id="an_1346"></span> Or for to speke of love and wommanhede,  
<span id="an_1347"></span> Ne knyght in armes to doon an hardy dede,  
<span id="an_1348"></span> To stonden in grace of his lady deere,  
<span id="an_1349"></span> Than hadde this preest this soory craft to
leere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1350">1350</span></span> And to the
chanoun thus he spak and seyde:  
<span id="an_1351"></span> "For love of God, that for us alle deyde,  
<span id="an_1352"></span> And as I may deserve it unto yow,  
<span id="an_1353"></span> What shal this receite coste? Telleth now!"  
<span id="an_1354"></span> "By oure Lady," quod this chanon, "it is
deere,  
<span id="an_1355"></span> I warne yow wel; for save I and a frere,  
<span id="an_1356"></span> In Engelond ther kan no man it make."  
<span id="an_1357"></span> "No fors," quod he, "now, sire, for Goddes
sake,  
<span id="an_1358"></span> What shal I paye? Telleth me, I preye."  
<span id="an_1359"></span> "Ywis," quod he, "it is ful deere, I seye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1360">1360</span></span> Sire, at o
word, if that thee list it have,  
<span id="an_1361"></span> Ye shul paye fourty pound, so God me save!  
<span id="an_1362"></span> And nere the freendshipe that ye dide er
this  
<span id="an_1363"></span> To me, ye sholde paye moore, ywis."  
<span id="an_1364"></span> This preest the somme of fourty pound anon  
<span id="an_1365"></span> Of nobles fette, and took hem everichon  
<span id="an_1366"></span> To this chanoun for this ilke receite.  
<span id="an_1367"></span> Al his werkyng nas but fraude and deceite.  
<span id="an_1368"></span> "Sire preest," he seyde, "I kepe han no
loos  
<span id="an_1369"></span> Of my craft, for I wolde it kept were
cloos;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1370">1370</span></span> And, as ye
love me, kepeth it secree.  
<span id="an_1371"></span> For, and men knewen al my soutiltee,  
<span id="an_1372"></span> By God, they wolden han so greet envye  
<span id="an_1373"></span> To me by cause of my philosophye  
<span id="an_1374"></span> I sholde be deed; ther were noon oother
weye."  
<span id="an_1375"></span> "God it forbeede," quod the preest, "what sey
ye?  
<span id="an_1376"></span> Yet hadde I levere spenden al the good  
<span id="an_1377"></span> Which that I have, and elles wexe I wood,  
<span id="an_1378"></span> Than that ye sholden falle in swich
mescheef."  
<span id="an_1379"></span> "For youre good wyl, sire, have ye right good
preef,"  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1380">1380</span></span> Quod the
chanoun, "and farwel, grant mercy!"  
<span id="an_1381"></span> He wente his wey, and never the preest hym
sy  
<span id="an_1382"></span> After that day; and whan that this preest
shoolde  
<span id="an_1383"></span> Maken assay, at swich tyme as he wolde,  
<span id="an_1384"></span> Of this receit, farwel! It wolde nat be.  
<span id="an_1385"></span> Lo, thus byjaped and bigiled was he!  
<span id="an_1386"></span> Thus maketh he his introduccioun,  
<span id="an_1387"></span> To brynge folk to hir destruccioun.  
<span id="an_1388"></span> Considereth, sires, how that, in ech
estaat,  
<span id="an_1389"></span> Bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1390">1390</span></span> So ferforth
that unnethes is ther noon.  
<span id="an_1391"></span> This multiplying blent so many oon  
<span id="an_1392"></span> That in good feith I trowe that it bee  
<span id="an_1393"></span> The cause grettest of swich scarsetee.  
<span id="an_1394"></span> Philosophres speken so mystily  
<span id="an_1395"></span> In this craft that men kan nat come therby,  
<span id="an_1396"></span> For any wit that men han now-a-dayes.  
<span id="an_1397"></span> They mowe wel chiteren as doon jayes,  
<span id="an_1398"></span> And in hir termes sette hir lust and peyne,  
<span id="an_1399"></span> But to hir purpos shul they nevere atteyne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400">1400</span></span> A man may
lightly lerne, if he have aught,  
<span id="an_1401"></span> To multiplie, and brynge his good to
naught!  
<span id="an_1402"></span> Lo! swich a lucre is in this lusty game,  
<span id="an_1403"></span> A mannes myrthe it wol turne unto grame,  
<span id="an_1404"></span> And empten also grete and hevye purses,  
<span id="an_1405"></span> And maken folk for to purchacen curses  
<span id="an_1406"></span> Of hem that han hir good therto ylent.  
<span id="an_1407"></span> O, fy, for shame! They that han been brent,  
<span id="an_1408"></span> Allas, kan they nat flee the fires heete?  
<span id="an_1409"></span> Ye that it use, I rede ye it leete,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1410">1410</span></span> Lest ye
lese al; for bet than nevere is late.  
<span id="an_1411"></span> Nevere to thryve were to long a date.  
<span id="an_1412"></span> Though ye prolle ay, ye shul it nevere
fynde.  
<span id="an_1413"></span> Ye been as boold as is Bayard the blynde,  
<span id="an_1414"></span> That blondreth forth and peril casteth
noon.  
<span id="an_1415"></span> He is as boold to renne agayn a stoon  
<span id="an_1416"></span> As for to goon bisides in the weye.  
<span id="an_1417"></span> So faren ye that multiplie, I seye.  
<span id="an_1418"></span> If that youre eyen kan nat seen aright,  
<span id="an_1419"></span> Looke that youre mynde lakke noght his

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1420">1420</span></span> For though
ye looken never so brode and stare,  
<span id="an_1421"></span> Ye shul nothyng wynne on that chaffare,  
<span id="an_1422"></span> But wasten al that ye may rape and renne.  
<span id="an_1423"></span> Withdraweth the fir, lest it to faste
brenne;  
<span id="an_1424"></span> Medleth namoore with that art, I mene,  
<span id="an_1425"></span> For if ye doon, youre thrift is goon ful
clene.  
<span id="an_1426"></span> And right as swithe I wol yow tellen heere  
<span id="an_1427"></span> What philosophres seyn in this mateere.  
<span id="an_1428"></span> Lo, thus seith Arnold of the Newe Toun,  
<span id="an_1429"></span> As his Rosarie maketh mencioun;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1430">1430</span></span> He seith
right thus, withouten any lye:  
<span id="an_1431"></span> "Ther may no man mercurie mortifie  
<span id="an_1432"></span> But it be with his brother knowlechyng";  
<span id="an_1433"></span> How \[be\] that he which that first seyde
this thyng  
<span id="an_1434"></span> Of philosophres fader was, Hermes;  
<span id="an_1435"></span> He seith how that the dragon, doutelees,  
<span id="an_1436"></span> Ne dyeth nat but if that he be slayn  
<span id="an_1437"></span> With his brother; and that is for to sayn,  
<span id="an_1438"></span> By the dragon, Mercurie, and noon oother  
<span id="an_1439"></span> He understood, and brymstoon by his
brother,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1440">1440</span></span> That out of
Sol and Luna were ydrawe.  
<span id="an_1441"></span> "And therfore," seyde he -- taak heede to my
sawe --  
<span id="an_1442"></span> "Lat no man bisye hym this art for to
seche,  
<span id="an_1443"></span> But if that he th' entencioun and speche  
<span id="an_1444"></span> Of philosophres understonde kan;  
<span id="an_1445"></span> And if he do, he is a lewed man.  
<span id="an_1446"></span> For this science and this konnyng," quod
he,  
<span id="an_1447"></span> "Is of the secree of the secretes, pardee."  
<span id="an_1448"></span> Also ther was a disciple of Plato,  
<span id="an_1449"></span> That on a tyme seyde his maister to,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1450">1450</span></span> As his book
Senior wol bere witnesse,  
<span id="an_1451"></span> And this was his demande in soothfastnesse:  
<span id="an_1452"></span> "Telle me the name of the privee stoon."  
<span id="an_1453"></span> And Plato answerde unto hym anoon,  
<span id="an_1454"></span> "Take the stoon that Titanos men name."  
<span id="an_1455"></span> "Which is that?" quod he. "Magnasia is the
same,"  
<span id="an_1456"></span> Seyde Plato. "Ye, sire, and is it thus?  
<span id="an_1457"></span> This is ignotum per ignocius.  
<span id="an_1458"></span> What is Magnasia, good sire, I yow preye?"  
<span id="an_1459"></span> "It is a water that is maad, I seye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1460">1460</span></span> Of
elementes foure," quod Plato.  
<span id="an_1461"></span> "Telle me the roote, good sire," quod he
tho,  
<span id="an_1462"></span> "Of that water, if it be youre wil."  
<span id="an_1463"></span> "Nay, nay," quod Plato, "certein, that I
nyl.  
<span id="an_1464"></span> The philosophres sworn were everychoon  
<span id="an_1465"></span> That they sholden discovere it unto noon,  
<span id="an_1466"></span> Ne in no book it write in no manere.  
<span id="an_1467"></span> For unto Crist it is so lief and deere  
<span id="an_1468"></span> That he wol nat that it discovered bee,  
<span id="an_1469"></span> But where it liketh to his deitee  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1470">1470</span></span> Men for t'
enspire, and eek for to deffende  
<span id="an_1471"></span> Whom that hym liketh; lo, this is the
ende."  
<span id="an_1472"></span> Thanne conclude I thus, sith that God of
hevene  
<span id="an_1473"></span> Ne wil nat that the philosophres nevene  
<span id="an_1474"></span> How that a man shal come unto this stoon,  
<span id="an_1475"></span> I rede, as for the beste, lete it goon.  
<span id="an_1476"></span> For whoso maketh God his adversarie,  
<span id="an_1477"></span> As for to werken any thyng in contrarie  
<span id="an_1478"></span> Of his wil, certes, never shal he thryve,  
<span id="an_1479"></span> Thogh that he multiplie terme of his lyve.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1480">1480</span></span> And there a
poynt, for ended is my tale.  
<span id="an_1481"></span> God sende every trewe man boote of his
bale!
