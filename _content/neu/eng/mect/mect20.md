### The Merchant's Tale

<span id="an_1245"></span> Whilom ther was dwellynge in Lumbardye  
<span id="an_1246"></span> A worthy knyght, that born was of Pavye,  
<span id="an_1247"></span> In which he lyved in greet prosperitee;  
<span id="an_1248"></span> And sixty yeer a wyflees man was hee,  
<span id="an_1249"></span> And folwed ay his bodily delyt  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1250">1250</span></span> On wommen,
ther as was his appetyt,  
<span id="an_1251"></span> As doon thise fooles that been seculeer.  
<span id="an_1252"></span> And whan that he was passed sixty yeer,  
<span id="an_1253"></span> Were it for hoolynesse or for dotage  
<span id="an_1254"></span> I kan nat seye, but swich a greet corage  
<span id="an_1255"></span> Hadde this knyght to been a wedded man  
<span id="an_1256"></span> That day and nyght he dooth al that he kan  
<span id="an_1257"></span> T' espien where he myghte wedded be,  
<span id="an_1258"></span> Preyinge oure Lord to graunten him that he  
<span id="an_1259"></span> Mighte ones knowe of thilke blisful lyf  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1260">1260</span></span> That is
bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf,  
<span id="an_1261"></span> And for to lyve under that hooly boond  
<span id="an_1262"></span> With which that first God man and womman
bond.  
<span id="an_1263"></span> "Noon oother lyf," seyde he, "is worth a
bene,  
<span id="an_1264"></span> For wedlok is so esy and so clene,  
<span id="an_1265"></span> That in this world it is a paradys."  
<span id="an_1266"></span> Thus seyde this olde knyght, that was so
wys.  
<span id="an_1267"></span> And certeinly, as sooth as God is kyng,  
<span id="an_1268"></span> To take a wyf it is a glorious thyng,  
<span id="an_1269"></span> And namely whan a man is oold and hoor;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1270">1270</span></span> Thanne is a
wyf the fruyt of his tresor.  
<span id="an_1271"></span> Thanne sholde he take a yong wyf and a
feir,  
<span id="an_1272"></span> On which he myghte engendren hym an heir,  
<span id="an_1273"></span> And lede his lyf in joye and in solas,  
<span id="an_1274"></span> Where as thise bacheleris synge "allas,"  
<span id="an_1275"></span> Whan that they fynden any adversitee  
<span id="an_1276"></span> In love, which nys but childyssh vanytee.  
<span id="an_1277"></span> And trewely it sit wel to be so,  
<span id="an_1278"></span> That bacheleris have often peyne and wo;  
<span id="an_1279"></span> On brotel ground they buylde, and
brotelnesse  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1280">1280</span></span> They fynde
whan they wene sikernesse.  
<span id="an_1281"></span> They lyve but as a bryd or as a beest,  
<span id="an_1282"></span> In libertee and under noon arreest,  
<span id="an_1283"></span> Ther as a wedded man in his estaat  
<span id="an_1284"></span> Lyveth a lyf blisful and ordinaat  
<span id="an_1285"></span> Under this yok of mariage ybounde.  
<span id="an_1286"></span> Wel may his herte in joy and blisse
habounde,  
<span id="an_1287"></span> For who kan be so buxom as a wyf?  
<span id="an_1288"></span> Who is so trewe, and eek so ententyf  
<span id="an_1289"></span> To kepe hym, syk and hool, as is his make?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1290">1290</span></span> For wele or
wo she wole hym nat forsake;  
<span id="an_1291"></span> She nys nat wery hym to love and serve,  
<span id="an_1292"></span> Though that he lye bedrede til he sterve.  
<span id="an_1293"></span> And yet somme clerkes seyn it nys nat so,  
<span id="an_1294"></span> Of whiche he Theofraste is oon of tho.  
<span id="an_1295"></span> What force though Theofraste liste lye?  
<span id="an_1296"></span> "Ne take no wyf," quod he, "for
housbondrye,  
<span id="an_1297"></span> As for to spare in houshold thy dispence.  
<span id="an_1298"></span> A trewe servant dooth moore diligence  
<span id="an_1299"></span> Thy good to kepe than thyn owene wyf,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300">1300</span></span> For she wol
clayme half part al hir lyf.  
<span id="an_1301"></span> And if thou be syk, so God me save,  
<span id="an_1302"></span> Thy verray freendes, or a trewe knave,  
<span id="an_1303"></span> Wol kepe thee bet than she that waiteth ay  
<span id="an_1304"></span> After thy good and hath doon many a day.  
<span id="an_1305"></span> And if thou take a wyf unto thyn hoold  
<span id="an_1306"></span> Ful lightly maystow been a cokewold."  
<span id="an_1307"></span> This sentence, and an hundred thynges
worse,  
<span id="an_1308"></span> Writeth this man, ther God his bones corse!  
<span id="an_1309"></span> But take no kep of al swich vanytee;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1310">1310</span></span> Deffie
Theofraste, and herke me.  
<span id="an_1311"></span> A wyf is Goddes yifte verraily;  
<span id="an_1312"></span> Alle othere manere yiftes hardily,  
<span id="an_1313"></span> As londes, rentes, pasture, or commune,  
<span id="an_1314"></span> Or moebles -- alle been yiftes of Fortune  
<span id="an_1315"></span> That passen as a shadwe upon a wal.  
<span id="an_1316"></span> But drede nat, if pleynly speke I shal:  
<span id="an_1317"></span> A wyf wol laste, and in thyn hous endure,  
<span id="an_1318"></span> Wel lenger than thee list, paraventure.  
<span id="an_1319"></span> Mariage is a ful greet sacrement.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1320">1320</span></span> He which
that hath no wyf, I holde hym shent;  
<span id="an_1321"></span> He lyveth helplees and al desolat --  
<span id="an_1322"></span> I speke of folk in seculer estaat.  
<span id="an_1323"></span> And herke why -- I sey nat this for noght
--  
<span id="an_1324"></span> That womman is for mannes helpe ywroght.  
<span id="an_1325"></span> The hye God, whan he hadde Adam maked,  
<span id="an_1326"></span> And saugh him al allone, bely-naked,  
<span id="an_1327"></span> God of his grete goodnesse seyde than,  
<span id="an_1328"></span> "Lat us now make an helpe unto this man  
<span id="an_1329"></span> Lyk to hymself"; and thanne he made him
Eve.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1330">1330</span></span> Heere may
ye se, and heerby may ye preve,  
<span id="an_1331"></span> That wyf is mannes helpe and his confort,  
<span id="an_1332"></span> His paradys terrestre, and his disport.  
<span id="an_1333"></span> So buxom and so vertuous is she,  
<span id="an_1334"></span> They moste nedes lyve in unitee.  
<span id="an_1335"></span> O flessh they been, and o fleesh, as I
gesse,  
<span id="an_1336"></span> Hath but oon herte, in wele and in
distresse.  
<span id="an_1337"></span> A wyf! a, Seinte Marie, benedicite!  
<span id="an_1338"></span> How myghte a man han any adversitee  
<span id="an_1339"></span> That hath a wyf? Certes, I kan nat seye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1340">1340</span></span> The blisse
which that is bitwixe hem tweye  
<span id="an_1341"></span> Ther may no tonge telle, or herte thynke.  
<span id="an_1342"></span> If he be povre, she helpeth hym to swynke;  
<span id="an_1343"></span> She kepeth his good, and wasteth never a
deel;  
<span id="an_1344"></span> Al that hire housbonde lust, hire liketh
weel;  
<span id="an_1345"></span> She seith nat ones "nay," whan he seith
"ye."  
<span id="an_1346"></span> "Do this," seith he; "Al redy, sire," seith
she.  
<span id="an_1347"></span> O blisful ordre of wedlok precious,  
<span id="an_1348"></span> Thou art so murye, and eek so vertuous,  
<span id="an_1349"></span> And so commended and appreved eek  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1350">1350</span></span> That every
man that halt hym worth a leek  
<span id="an_1351"></span> Upon his bare knees oughte al his lyf  
<span id="an_1352"></span> Thanken his God that hym hath sent a wyf,  
<span id="an_1353"></span> Or elles preye to God hym for to sende  
<span id="an_1354"></span> A wyf to laste unto his lyves ende.  
<span id="an_1355"></span> For thanne his lyf is set in sikernesse;  
<span id="an_1356"></span> He may nat be deceyved, as I gesse,  
<span id="an_1357"></span> So that he werke after his wyves reed.  
<span id="an_1358"></span> Thanne may he boldely beren up his heed,  
<span id="an_1359"></span> They been so trewe and therwithal so wyse;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1360">1360</span></span> For which,
if thou wolt werken as the wyse,  
<span id="an_1361"></span> Do alwey so as wommen wol thee rede.  
<span id="an_1362"></span> Lo, how that Jacob, as thise clerkes rede,  
<span id="an_1363"></span> By good conseil of his mooder Rebekke,  
<span id="an_1364"></span> Boond the kydes skyn aboute his nekke,  
<span id="an_1365"></span> For which his fadres benyson he wan.  
<span id="an_1366"></span> Lo Judith, as the storie eek telle kan,  
<span id="an_1367"></span> By wys conseil she Goddes peple kepte,  
<span id="an_1368"></span> And slow hym Olofernus, whil he slepte.  
<span id="an_1369"></span> Lo Abigayl, by good conseil how she  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1370">1370</span></span> Saved hir
housbonde Nabal whan that he  
<span id="an_1371"></span> Sholde han be slayn; and looke, Ester also  
<span id="an_1372"></span> By good conseil delyvered out of wo  
<span id="an_1373"></span> The peple of God, and made hym Mardochee  
<span id="an_1374"></span> Of Assuere enhaunced for to be.  
<span id="an_1375"></span> Ther nys no thyng in gree superlatyf,  
<span id="an_1376"></span> As seith Senek, above an humble wyf.  
<span id="an_1377"></span> Suffre thy wyves tonge, as Catoun bit;  
<span id="an_1378"></span> She shal comande, and thou shalt suffren
it,  
<span id="an_1379"></span> And yet she wole obeye of curteisye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1380">1380</span></span> A wyf is
kepere of thyn housbondrye;  
<span id="an_1381"></span> Wel may the sike man biwaille and wepe,  
<span id="an_1382"></span> Ther as ther nys no wyf the hous to kepe.  
<span id="an_1383"></span> I warne thee, if wisely thou wolt wirche,  
<span id="an_1384"></span> Love wel thy wyf, as Crist loved his
chirche.  
<span id="an_1385"></span> If thou lovest thyself, thou lovest thy
wyf;  
<span id="an_1386"></span> No man hateth his flessh, but in his lyf  
<span id="an_1387"></span> He fostreth it, and therfore bidde I thee  
<span id="an_1388"></span> Cherisse thy wyf, or thou shalt nevere
thee.  
<span id="an_1389"></span> Housbonde and wyf, what so men jape or
pleye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1390">1390</span></span> Of worldly
folk holden the siker weye;  
<span id="an_1391"></span> They been so knyt ther may noon harm
bityde,  
<span id="an_1392"></span> And namely upon the wyves syde.  
<span id="an_1393"></span> For which this Januarie, of whom I tolde,  
<span id="an_1394"></span> Considered hath, inwith his dayes olde,  
<span id="an_1395"></span> The lusty lyf, the vertuous quyete,  
<span id="an_1396"></span> That is in mariage hony-sweete,  
<span id="an_1397"></span> And for his freendes on a day he sente,  
<span id="an_1398"></span> To tellen hem th' effect of his entente.  
<span id="an_1399"></span> With face sad his tale he hath hem toold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400">1400</span></span> He seyde,
"Freendes, I am hoor and oold,  
<span id="an_1401"></span> And almoost, God woot, on my pittes brynke;  
<span id="an_1402"></span> Upon my soule somwhat moste I thynke.  
<span id="an_1403"></span> I have my body folily despended;  
<span id="an_1404"></span> Blessed be God that it shal been amended!  
<span id="an_1405"></span> For I wol be, certeyn, a wedded man,  
<span id="an_1406"></span> And that anoon in al the haste I kan.  
<span id="an_1407"></span> Unto som mayde fair and tendre of age,  
<span id="an_1408"></span> I prey yow, shapeth for my mariage  
<span id="an_1409"></span> Al sodeynly, for I wol nat abyde;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1410">1410</span></span> And I wol
fonde t' espien, on my syde,  
<span id="an_1411"></span> To whom I may be wedded hastily.  
<span id="an_1412"></span> But forasmuche as ye been mo than I,  
<span id="an_1413"></span> Ye shullen rather swich a thyng espyen  
<span id="an_1414"></span> Than I, and where me best were to allyen.  
<span id="an_1415"></span> "But o thyng warne I yow, my freendes
deere,  
<span id="an_1416"></span> I wol noon oold wyf han in no manere.  
<span id="an_1417"></span> She shal nat passe twenty yeer, certayn;  
<span id="an_1418"></span> Oold fissh and yong flessh wolde I have
fayn.  
<span id="an_1419"></span> Bet is," quod he, "a pyk than a pykerel,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1420">1420</span></span> And bet
than old boef is the tendre veel.  
<span id="an_1421"></span> I wol no womman thritty yeer of age;  
<span id="an_1422"></span> It is but bene-straw and greet forage.  
<span id="an_1423"></span> And eek thise olde wydwes, God it woot,  
<span id="an_1424"></span> They konne so muchel craft on Wades boot,  
<span id="an_1425"></span> So muchel broken harm, whan that hem leste,  
<span id="an_1426"></span> That with hem sholde I nevere lyve in

<span id="an_1427"></span> For sondry scoles maken sotile clerkis;  
<span id="an_1428"></span> Womman of manye scoles half a clerk is.  
<span id="an_1429"></span> But certeynly, a yong thyng may men gye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1430">1430</span></span> Right as
men may warm wex with handes plye.  
<span id="an_1431"></span> Wherfore I sey yow pleynly, in a clause,  
<span id="an_1432"></span> I wol noon oold wyf han right for this
cause.  
<span id="an_1433"></span> For if so were I hadde swich myschaunce  
<span id="an_1434"></span> That I in hire ne koude han no plesaunce,  
<span id="an_1435"></span> Thanne sholde I lede my lyf in avoutrye  
<span id="an_1436"></span> And go streight to the devel whan I dye.  
<span id="an_1437"></span> Ne children sholde I none upon hire geten;  
<span id="an_1438"></span> Yet were me levere houndes had me eten  
<span id="an_1439"></span> Than that myn heritage sholde falle  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1440">1440</span></span> In straunge
hand, and this I telle yow alle.  
<span id="an_1441"></span> I dote nat; I woot the cause why  
<span id="an_1442"></span> Men sholde wedde, and forthermoore woot I  
<span id="an_1443"></span> Ther speketh many a man of mariage  
<span id="an_1444"></span> That woot namoore of it than woot my page  
<span id="an_1445"></span> For whiche causes man sholde take a wyf.  
<span id="an_1446"></span> If he ne may nat lyven chaast his lyf,  
<span id="an_1447"></span> Take hym a wyf with greet devocioun,  
<span id="an_1448"></span> By cause of leveful procreacioun  
<span id="an_1449"></span> Of children to th' onour of God above,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1450">1450</span></span> And nat
oonly for paramour or love;  
<span id="an_1451"></span> And for they sholde leccherye eschue,  
<span id="an_1452"></span> And yelde hir dette whan that it is due;

<span id="an_1455"></span> And lyve in chastitee ful holily.  
<span id="an_1456"></span> But sires, by youre leve, that am nat I.  
<span id="an_1457"></span> For -- God be thanked! -- I dar make avaunt  
<span id="an_1458"></span> I feele my lymes stark and suffisaunt  
<span id="an_1459"></span> To do al that a man bilongeth to;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1460">1460</span></span> I woot
myselven best what I may do.  
<span id="an_1461"></span> Though I be hoor, I fare as dooth a tree

<span id="an_1467"></span> And syn that ye han herd al myn entente,  
<span id="an_1468"></span> I prey yow to my wyl ye wole assente."  
<span id="an_1469"></span> Diverse men diversely hym tolde  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1470">1470</span></span> Of mariage
manye ensamples olde.  
<span id="an_1471"></span> Somme blamed it, somme preysed it, certeyn,  
<span id="an_1472"></span> But atte laste, shortly for to seyn,  
<span id="an_1473"></span> As al day falleth altercacioun  
<span id="an_1474"></span> Bitwixen freendes in disputisoun,  
<span id="an_1475"></span> Ther fil a stryf bitwixe his bretheren two,  
<span id="an_1476"></span> Of whiche that oon was cleped Placebo;  
<span id="an_1477"></span> Justinus soothly called was that oother.  
<span id="an_1478"></span> Placebo seyde, "O Januarie, brother,

<span id="an_1483"></span> To weyven fro the word of Salomon.  
<span id="an_1484"></span> This word seyde he unto us everychon:  
<span id="an_1485"></span> \`Wirk alle thyng by conseil,' thus seyde
he,  
<span id="an_1486"></span> \`And thanne shaltow nat repente thee.'  
<span id="an_1487"></span> But though that Salomon spak swich a word,

<span id="an_1491"></span> For, brother myn, of me taak this motyf:  
<span id="an_1492"></span> I have now been a court-man al my lyf,  
<span id="an_1493"></span> And God it woot, though I unworthy be,  
<span id="an_1494"></span> I have stonden in ful greet degree  
<span id="an_1495"></span> Abouten lordes of ful heigh estaat;

<span id="an_1756"></span> That thilke nyght offenden hire moste he,  
<span id="an_1757"></span> And thoughte, "Allas! O tendre creature,  
<span id="an_1758"></span> Now wolde God ye myghte wel endure  
<span id="an_1759"></span> Al my corage, it is so sharp and keene!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1760">1760</span></span> I am agast
ye shul it nat susteene.  
<span id="an_1761"></span> But God forbede that I dide al my myght!  
<span id="an_1762"></span> Now wolde God that it were woxen nyght,  
<span id="an_1763"></span> And that the nyght wolde lasten everemo.  
<span id="an_1764"></span> I wolde that al this peple were ago."  
<span id="an_1765"></span> And finally he dooth al his labour,  
<span id="an_1766"></span> As he best myghte, savynge his honour,  
<span id="an_1767"></span> To haste hem fro the mete in subtil wyse.  
<span id="an_1768"></span> The tyme cam that resoun was to ryse;  
<span id="an_1769"></span> And after that men daunce and drynken
faste,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1770">1770</span></span> And spices
al aboute the hous they caste,  
<span id="an_1771"></span> And ful of joye and blisse is every man --  
<span id="an_1772"></span> Al but a squyer, highte Damyan,  
<span id="an_1773"></span> Which carf biforn the knyght ful many a
day.  
<span id="an_1774"></span> He was so ravysshed on his lady May  
<span id="an_1775"></span> That for the verray peyne he was ny wood.  
<span id="an_1776"></span> Almoost he swelte and swowned ther he
stood,  
<span id="an_1777"></span> So soore hath Venus hurt hym with hire
brond,  
<span id="an_1778"></span> As that she bar it daunsynge in hire hond;  
<span id="an_1779"></span> And to his bed he wente hym hastily.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1780">1780</span></span> Namoore of
hym at this tyme speke I,  
<span id="an_1781"></span> But there I lete hym wepe ynogh and pleyne  
<span id="an_1782"></span> Til fresshe May wol rewen on his peyne.  
<span id="an_1783"></span> O perilous fyr, that in the bedstraw
bredeth!  
<span id="an_1784"></span> O famulier foo, that his servyce bedeth!  
<span id="an_1785"></span> O servant traytour, false hoomly hewe,  
<span id="an_1786"></span> Lyk to the naddre in bosom sly untrewe,  
<span id="an_1787"></span> God shilde us alle from youre aqueyntaunce!  
<span id="an_1788"></span> O Januarie, dronken in plesaunce  
<span id="an_1789"></span> In mariage, se how thy Damyan,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1790">1790</span></span> Thyn owene
squier and thy borne man,  
<span id="an_1791"></span> Entendeth for to do thee vileynye.  
<span id="an_1792"></span> God graunte thee thyn hoomly fo t' espye!  
<span id="an_1793"></span> For in this world nys worse pestilence  
<span id="an_1794"></span> Than hoomly foo al day in thy presence.  
<span id="an_1795"></span> Parfourned hath the sonne his ark diurne;  
<span id="an_1796"></span> No lenger may the body of hym sojurne  
<span id="an_1797"></span> On th' orisonte, as in that latitude.  
<span id="an_1798"></span> Night with his mantel, that is derk and
rude,  
<span id="an_1799"></span> Gan oversprede the hemysperie aboute;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800">1800</span></span> For which
departed is this lusty route  
<span id="an_1801"></span> Fro Januarie, with thank on every syde.  
<span id="an_1802"></span> Hoom to hir houses lustily they ryde,  
<span id="an_1803"></span> Where as they doon hir thynges as hem
leste,  
<span id="an_1804"></span> And whan they sye hir tyme, goon to reste.  
<span id="an_1805"></span> Soone after that, this hastif Januarie  
<span id="an_1806"></span> Wolde go to bedde; he wolde no lenger
tarye.  
<span id="an_1807"></span> He drynketh ypocras, clarree, and vernage  
<span id="an_1808"></span> Of spices hoote t' encreessen his corage;  
<span id="an_1809"></span> And many a letuarie hath he ful fyn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1810">1810</span></span> Swiche as
the cursed monk, daun Constantyn,  
<span id="an_1811"></span> Hath writen in his book De Coitu;  
<span id="an_1812"></span> To eten hem alle he nas no thyng eschu.  
<span id="an_1813"></span> And to his privee freendes thus seyde he:  
<span id="an_1814"></span> "For Goddes love, as soone as it may be,  
<span id="an_1815"></span> Lat voyden al this hous in curteys wyse."  
<span id="an_1816"></span> And they han doon right as he wol devyse.  
<span id="an_1817"></span> Men drynken and the travers drawe anon.  
<span id="an_1818"></span> The bryde was broght abedde as stille as
stoon;  
<span id="an_1819"></span> And whan the bed was with the preest
yblessed,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1820">1820</span></span> Out of the
chambre hath every wight hym dressed,  
<span id="an_1821"></span> And Januarie hath faste in armes take  
<span id="an_1822"></span> His fresshe May, his paradys, his make.  
<span id="an_1823"></span> He lulleth hire; he kisseth hire ful ofte;  
<span id="an_1824"></span> With thikke brustles of his berd unsofte,  
<span id="an_1825"></span> Lyk to the skyn of houndfyssh, sharp as brere
--  
<span id="an_1826"></span> For he was shave al newe in his manere --  
<span id="an_1827"></span> He rubbeth hire aboute hir tendre face,  
<span id="an_1828"></span> And seyde thus, "Allas! I moot trespace  
<span id="an_1829"></span> To yow, my spouse, and yow greetly offende  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1830">1830</span></span> Er tyme
come that I wil doun descende.  
<span id="an_1831"></span> But nathelees, considereth this," quod he,  
<span id="an_1832"></span> "Ther nys no werkman, whatsoevere he be,  
<span id="an_1833"></span> That may bothe werke wel and hastily;  
<span id="an_1834"></span> This wol be doon at leyser parfitly.  
<span id="an_1835"></span> It is no fors how longe that we pleye;  
<span id="an_1836"></span> In trewe wedlok coupled be we tweye,  
<span id="an_1837"></span> And blessed be the yok that we been inne,  
<span id="an_1838"></span> For in oure actes we mowe do no synne.  
<span id="an_1839"></span> A man may do no synne with his wyf,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1840">1840</span></span> Ne hurte
hymselven with his owene knyf,  
<span id="an_1841"></span> For we han leve to pleye us by the lawe."  
<span id="an_1842"></span> Thus laboureth he til that the day gan
dawe;  
<span id="an_1843"></span> And thanne he taketh a sop in fyn clarree,  
<span id="an_1844"></span> And upright in his bed thanne sitteth he,  
<span id="an_1845"></span> And after that he sang ful loude and
cleere,  
<span id="an_1846"></span> And kiste his wyf, and made wantown cheere.  
<span id="an_1847"></span> He was al coltissh, ful of ragerye,  
<span id="an_1848"></span> And ful of jargon as a flekked pye.  
<span id="an_1849"></span> The slakke skyn aboute his nekke shaketh  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1850">1850</span></span> Whil that
he sang, so chaunteth he and craketh.  
<span id="an_1851"></span> But God woot what that May thoughte in hir
herte,  
<span id="an_1852"></span> Whan she hym saugh up sittynge in his
sherte,  
<span id="an_1853"></span> In his nyght-cappe, and with his nekke
lene;  
<span id="an_1854"></span> She preyseth nat his pleyyng worth a bene.  
<span id="an_1855"></span> Thanne seide he thus, "My reste wol I take;  
<span id="an_1856"></span> Now day is come, I may no lenger wake."  
<span id="an_1857"></span> And doun he leyde his heed and sleep til
pryme.  
<span id="an_1858"></span> And afterward, whan that he saugh his tyme,  
<span id="an_1859"></span> Up ryseth Januarie; but fresshe May  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1860">1860</span></span> Heeld hire
chambre unto the fourthe day,  
<span id="an_1861"></span> As usage is of wyves for the beste.  
<span id="an_1862"></span> For every labour somtyme moot han reste,  
<span id="an_1863"></span> Or elles longe may he nat endure;  
<span id="an_1864"></span> This is to seyn, no lyves creature,  
<span id="an_1865"></span> Be it of fyssh, or bryd, or beest, or man.  
<span id="an_1866"></span> Now wol I speke of woful Damyan,  
<span id="an_1867"></span> That langwissheth for love, as ye shul
heere;  
<span id="an_1868"></span> Therfore I speke to hym in this manere:  
<span id="an_1869"></span> I seye, "O sely Damyan, allas!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1870">1870</span></span> Andswere to
my demaunde, as in this cas.  
<span id="an_1871"></span> How shaltow to thy lady, fresshe May,  
<span id="an_1872"></span> Telle thy wo? She wole alwey seye nay.  
<span id="an_1873"></span> Eek if thou speke, she wol thy wo biwreye.  
<span id="an_1874"></span> God be thyn helpe! I kan no bettre seye."  
<span id="an_1875"></span> This sike Damyan in Venus fyr  
<span id="an_1876"></span> So brenneth that he dyeth for desyr,  
<span id="an_1877"></span> For which he putte his lyf in aventure.  
<span id="an_1878"></span> No lenger myghte he in this wise endure,  
<span id="an_1879"></span> But prively a penner gan he borwe,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1880">1880</span></span> And in a
lettre wroot he al his sorwe,  
<span id="an_1881"></span> In manere of a compleynt or a lay,  
<span id="an_1882"></span> Unto his faire, fresshe lady May;  
<span id="an_1883"></span> And in a purs of sylk heng on his sherte  
<span id="an_1884"></span> He hath it put, and leyde it at his herte.  
<span id="an_1885"></span> The moone, that at noon was thilke day  
<span id="an_1886"></span> That Januarie hath wedded fresshe May  
<span id="an_1887"></span> In two of Tawr, was into Cancre glyden;  
<span id="an_1888"></span> So longe hath Mayus in hir chambre abyden,  
<span id="an_1889"></span> As custume is unto thise nobles alle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1890">1890</span></span> A bryde
shal nat eten in the halle  
<span id="an_1891"></span> Til dayes foure, or thre dayes atte leeste,

<span id="an_1893"></span> The fourthe day compleet fro noon to noon,  
<span id="an_1894"></span> Whan that the heighe masse was ydoon,  
<span id="an_1895"></span> In halle sit this Januarie and May,  
<span id="an_1896"></span> As fressh as is the brighte someres day.  
<span id="an_1897"></span> And so bifel how that this goode man  
<span id="an_1898"></span> Remembred hym upon this Damyan,  
<span id="an_1899"></span> And seyde, "Seynte Marie! how may this be,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900">1900</span></span> That Damyan
entendeth nat to me?  
<span id="an_1901"></span> Is he ay syk, or how may this bityde?"  
<span id="an_1902"></span> His squieres, whiche that stooden ther
bisyde,  
<span id="an_1903"></span> Excused hym by cause of his siknesse,  
<span id="an_1904"></span> Which letted hym to doon his bisynesse;  
<span id="an_1905"></span> Noon oother cause myghte make hym tarye.  
<span id="an_1906"></span> "That me forthynketh," quod this Januarie,  
<span id="an_1907"></span> "He is a gentil squier, by my trouthe!  
<span id="an_1908"></span> If that he deyde, it were harm and routhe.  
<span id="an_1909"></span> He is as wys, discreet, and as secree  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1910">1910</span></span> As any man
I woot of his degree,  
<span id="an_1911"></span> And therto manly, and eek servysable,  
<span id="an_1912"></span> And for to been a thrifty man right able.  
<span id="an_1913"></span> But after mete, as soone as evere I may,  
<span id="an_1914"></span> I wol myself visite hym, and eek May,  
<span id="an_1915"></span> To doon hym al the confort that I kan."  
<span id="an_1916"></span> And for that word hym blessed every man,  
<span id="an_1917"></span> That of his bountee and his gentillesse  
<span id="an_1918"></span> He wolde so conforten in siknesse  
<span id="an_1919"></span> His squier, for it was a gentil dede.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1920">1920</span></span> "Dame,"
quod this Januarie, "taak good hede,  
<span id="an_1921"></span> At after-mete ye with youre wommen alle,  
<span id="an_1922"></span> Whan ye han been in chambre out of this

<span id="an_1924"></span> Dooth hym disport -- he is a gentil man;  
<span id="an_1925"></span> And telleth hym that I wol hym visite,  
<span id="an_1926"></span> Have I no thyng but rested me a lite;  
<span id="an_1927"></span> And spede yow faste, for I wole abyde

<span id="an_1929"></span> And with that word he gan to hym to calle  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1930">1930</span></span> A squier,

<span id="an_1938"></span> In which that he ywriten hadde his wille,  
<span id="an_1939"></span> Hath put into hire hand, withouten moore,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1940">1940</span></span> Save that
he siketh wonder depe and soore,  
<span id="an_1941"></span> And softely to hire right thus seyde he:  
<span id="an_1942"></span> "Mercy! And that ye nat discovere me,  
<span id="an_1943"></span> For I am deed if that this thyng be kyd."  
<span id="an_1944"></span> This purs hath she inwith hir bosom hyd

<span id="an_1948"></span> He taketh hire, and kisseth hire ful ofte,  
<span id="an_1949"></span> And leyde hym doun to slepe, and that anon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1950">1950</span></span> She feyned

<span id="an_1953"></span> She rente it al to cloutes atte laste,  
<span id="an_1954"></span> And in the pryvee softely it caste.  
<span id="an_1955"></span> Who studieth now but faire fresshe May?  
<span id="an_1956"></span> Adoun by olde Januarie she lay,  
<span id="an_1957"></span> That sleep til that the coughe hath hym

<span id="an_1958"></span> Anon he preyde hire strepen hire al naked;  
<span id="an_1959"></span> He wolde of hire, he seyde, han som

<span id="an_1962"></span> But lest that precious folk be with me

<span id="an_1982"></span> "Certeyn," thoghte she, "whom that this thyng

<span id="an_1984"></span> To love hym best of any creature,  
<span id="an_1985"></span> Though he namoore hadde than his sherte."  
<span id="an_1986"></span> Lo, pitee renneth soone in gentil herte!  
<span id="an_1987"></span> Heere may ye se how excellent franchise  
<span id="an_1988"></span> In wommen is, whan they hem narwe avyse.  
<span id="an_1989"></span> Som tyrant is, as ther be many oon

<span id="an_1993"></span> And hem rejoysen in hire crueel pryde,  
<span id="an_1994"></span> And rekke nat to been an homycide.  
<span id="an_1995"></span> This gentil May, fulfilled of pitee,  
<span id="an_1996"></span> Right of hire hand a lettre made she,  
<span id="an_1997"></span> In which she graunteth hym hire verray

<span id="an_1998"></span> Ther lakketh noght oonly but day and place  
<span id="an_1999"></span> Wher that she myghte unto his lust suffise,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2000">2000</span></span> For it shal

<span id="an_2001"></span> And whan she saugh hir tyme, upon a day

was his siknesse and his sorwe.  
<span id="an_2011"></span> He kembeth hym, he preyneth hym and pyketh,  
<span id="an_2012"></span> He dooth al that his lady lust and lyketh,  
<span id="an_2013"></span> And eek to Januarie he gooth as lowe  
<span id="an_2014"></span> As evere dide a dogge for the bowe.  
<span id="an_2015"></span> He is so plesant unto every man  
<span id="an_2016"></span> (For craft is al, whoso that do it kan)  
<span id="an_2017"></span> That every wight is fayn to speke hym good,  
<span id="an_2018"></span> And fully in his lady grace he stood.  
<span id="an_2019"></span> Thus lete I Damyan aboute his nede,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2020">2020</span></span> And in my
tale forth I wol procede.  
<span id="an_2021"></span> Somme clerkes holden that felicitee  
<span id="an_2022"></span> Stant in delit, and therfore certeyn he,  
<span id="an_2023"></span> This noble Januarie, with al his myght,  
<span id="an_2024"></span> In honest wyse, as longeth to a knyght,  
<span id="an_2025"></span> Shoop hym to lyve ful deliciously.  
<span id="an_2026"></span> His housynge, his array, as honestly  
<span id="an_2027"></span> To his degree was maked as a kynges.  
<span id="an_2028"></span> Amonges othere of his honeste thynges,  
<span id="an_2029"></span> He made a gardyn, walled al with stoon;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2030">2030</span></span> So fair a
gardyn woot I nowher noon.  
<span id="an_2031"></span> For, out of doute, I verraily suppose  
<span id="an_2032"></span> That he that wroot the Romance of the Rose  
<span id="an_2033"></span> Ne koude of it the beautee wel devyse;  
<span id="an_2034"></span> Ne Priapus ne myghte nat suffise,  
<span id="an_2035"></span> Though he be god of gardyns, for to telle  
<span id="an_2036"></span> The beautee of the gardyn and the welle  
<span id="an_2037"></span> That stood under a laurer alwey grene.  
<span id="an_2038"></span> Ful ofte tyme he Pluto and his queene,  
<span id="an_2039"></span> Proserpina, and al hire fayerye,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2040">2040</span></span> Disporten
hem and maken melodye  
<span id="an_2041"></span> Aboute that welle, and daunced, as men
tolde.  
<span id="an_2042"></span> This noble knyght, this Januarie the olde,  
<span id="an_2043"></span> Swich deyntee hath in it to walke and
pleye,  
<span id="an_2044"></span> That he wol no wight suffren bere the keye  
<span id="an_2045"></span> Save he hymself; for of the smale wyket  
<span id="an_2046"></span> He baar alwey of silver a clyket,  
<span id="an_2047"></span> With which, whan that hym leste, he it
unshette.  
<span id="an_2048"></span> And whan he wolde paye his wyf hir dette  
<span id="an_2049"></span> In somer seson, thider wolde he go,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2050">2050</span></span> And May his
wyf, and no wight but they two;  
<span id="an_2051"></span> And thynges whiche that were nat doon
abedde,  
<span id="an_2052"></span> He in the gardyn parfourned hem and spedde.  
<span id="an_2053"></span> And in this wyse, many a murye day,  
<span id="an_2054"></span> Lyved this Januarie and fresshe May.  
<span id="an_2055"></span> But worldly joye may nat alwey dure  
<span id="an_2056"></span> To Januarie, ne to no creature.  
<span id="an_2057"></span> O sodeyn hap! O thou Fortune unstable!  
<span id="an_2058"></span> Lyk to the scorpion so deceyvable,  
<span id="an_2059"></span> That flaterest with thyn heed whan thou wolt
stynge;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2060">2060</span></span> Thy tayl is
deeth, thurgh thyn envenymynge.  
<span id="an_2061"></span> O brotil joye! O sweete venym queynte!  
<span id="an_2062"></span> O monstre, that so subtilly kanst peynte  
<span id="an_2063"></span> Thy yiftes under hewe of stidefastnesse,  
<span id="an_2064"></span> That thou deceyvest bothe moore and lesse!  
<span id="an_2065"></span> Why hastow Januarie thus deceyved,  
<span id="an_2066"></span> That haddest hym for thy fulle freend
receyved?  
<span id="an_2067"></span> And now thou hast biraft hym bothe his yen,  
<span id="an_2068"></span> For sorwe of which desireth he to dyen.  
<span id="an_2069"></span> Allas, this noble Januarie free,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2070">2070</span></span> Amydde his
lust and his prosperitee,  
<span id="an_2071"></span> Is woxen blynd, and that al sodeynly.  
<span id="an_2072"></span> He wepeth and he wayleth pitously;  
<span id="an_2073"></span> And therwithal the fyr of jalousie,  
<span id="an_2074"></span> Lest that his wyf sholde falle in som
folye,  
<span id="an_2075"></span> So brente his herte that he wolde fayn  
<span id="an_2076"></span> That som man bothe hire and hym had slayn.  
<span id="an_2077"></span> For neither after his deeth nor in his lyf  
<span id="an_2078"></span> Ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf,  
<span id="an_2079"></span> But evere lyve as wydwe in clothes blake,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2080">2080</span></span> Soul as the
turtle that lost hath hire make.  
<span id="an_2081"></span> But atte laste, after a month or tweye,  
<span id="an_2082"></span> His sorwe gan aswage, sooth to seye;  
<span id="an_2083"></span> For whan he wiste it may noon oother be,  
<span id="an_2084"></span> He paciently took his adversitee,  
<span id="an_2085"></span> Save, out of doute, he may nat forgoon  
<span id="an_2086"></span> That he nas jalous everemoore in oon;  
<span id="an_2087"></span> Which jalousye it was so outrageous  
<span id="an_2088"></span> That neither in halle, n' yn noon oother
hous,  
<span id="an_2089"></span> Ne in noon oother place, neverthemo,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2090">2090</span></span> He nolde
suffre hire for to ryde or go,  
<span id="an_2091"></span> But if that he had hond on hire alway;  
<span id="an_2092"></span> For which ful ofte wepeth fresshe May,  
<span id="an_2093"></span> That loveth Damyan so benyngnely  
<span id="an_2094"></span> That she moot outher dyen sodeynly  
<span id="an_2095"></span> Or elles she moot han hym as hir leste.  
<span id="an_2096"></span> She wayteth whan hir herte wolde breste.  
<span id="an_2097"></span> Upon that oother syde Damyan  
<span id="an_2098"></span> Bicomen is the sorwefulleste man  
<span id="an_2099"></span> That evere was, for neither nyght ne day  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2100">2100</span></span> Ne myghte
he speke a word to fresshe May,  
<span id="an_2101"></span> As to his purpos, of no swich mateere,  
<span id="an_2102"></span> But if that Januarie moste it heere,  
<span id="an_2103"></span> That hadde an hand upon hire everemo.  
<span id="an_2104"></span> But nathelees, by writyng to and fro  
<span id="an_2105"></span> And privee signes wiste he what she mente,  
<span id="an_2106"></span> And she knew eek the fyn of his entente.  
<span id="an_2107"></span> O Januarie, what myghte it thee availle,  
<span id="an_2108"></span> Thogh thou myghtest se as fer as shippes
saille?  
<span id="an_2109"></span> For as good is blynd deceyved be  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2110">2110</span></span> As to be
deceyved whan a man may se.  
<span id="an_2111"></span> Lo, Argus, which that hadde an hondred yen,  
<span id="an_2112"></span> For al that evere he koude poure or pryen,  
<span id="an_2113"></span> Yet was he blent, and, God woot, so been mo  
<span id="an_2114"></span> That wenen wisly that it be nat so.  
<span id="an_2115"></span> Passe over is an ese, I sey namoore.  
<span id="an_2116"></span> This fresshe May, that I spak of so yoore,  
<span id="an_2117"></span> In warm wex hath emprented the clyket  
<span id="an_2118"></span> That Januarie bar of the smale wyket,  
<span id="an_2119"></span> By which into his gardyn ofte he wente;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2120">2120</span></span> And Damyan,
that knew al hire entente,  
<span id="an_2121"></span> The cliket countrefeted pryvely.  
<span id="an_2122"></span> Ther nys namoore to seye, but hastily  
<span id="an_2123"></span> Som wonder by this clyket shal bityde,  
<span id="an_2124"></span> Which ye shul heeren, if ye wole abyde.  
<span id="an_2125"></span> O noble Ovyde, ful sooth seystou, God woot,  
<span id="an_2126"></span> What sleighte is it, thogh it be long and

<span id="an_2127"></span> That Love nyl fynde it out in som manere?  
<span id="an_2128"></span> By Piramus and Tesbee may men leere;

<span id="an_2132"></span> But now to purpos: er that dayes eighte  
<span id="an_2133"></span> Were passed \[of\] the month of \[Juyn\],

<span id="an_2134"></span> That Januarie hath caught so greet a wil,  
<span id="an_2135"></span> Thurgh eggyng of his wyf, hym for to pleye  
<span id="an_2136"></span> In his gardyn, and no wight but they tweye,  
<span id="an_2137"></span> That in a morwe unto his May seith he:  
<span id="an_2138"></span> "Rys up, my wyf, my love, my lady free!  
<span id="an_2139"></span> The turtles voys is herd, my dowve sweete;

<span id="an_2148"></span> I chees thee for my wyf and my confort."  
<span id="an_2149"></span> Swiche olde lewed wordes used he.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2150">2150</span></span> On Damyan a
signe made she,  
<span id="an_2151"></span> That he sholde go biforn with his cliket.  
<span id="an_2152"></span> This Damyan thanne hath opened the wyket,

<span id="an_2156"></span> This Januarie, as blynd as is a stoon,  
<span id="an_2157"></span> With Mayus in his hand, and no wight mo,  
<span id="an_2158"></span> Into his fresshe gardyn is ago,  
<span id="an_2159"></span> And clapte to the wyket sodeynly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2160">2160</span></span> "Now wyf,"
quod he, "heere nys but thou and I,

<span id="an_2186"></span> Benyngnely to Januarie answerde,  
<span id="an_2187"></span> But first and forward she bigan to wepe.  
<span id="an_2188"></span> "I have," quod she, "a soule for to kepe

<span id="an_2207"></span> And with that word she saugh wher Damyan  
<span id="an_2208"></span> Sat in the bussh, and coughen she bigan,  
<span id="an_2209"></span> And with hir fynger signes made she

<span id="an_2275"></span> So that ye men shul been as lewed as gees.  
<span id="an_2276"></span> "What rekketh me of youre auctoritees?  
<span id="an_2277"></span> I woot wel that this Jew, this Salomon,  
<span id="an_2278"></span> Foond of us wommen fooles many oon.  
<span id="an_2279"></span> But though that he ne foond no good womman,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2280">2280</span></span> Yet hath
ther founde many another man  
<span id="an_2281"></span> Wommen ful trewe, ful goode, and vertuous.  
<span id="an_2282"></span> Witnesse on hem that dwelle in Cristes
hous;  
<span id="an_2283"></span> With martirdom they preved hire constance.  
<span id="an_2284"></span> The Romayn geestes eek make remembrance  
<span id="an_2285"></span> Of many a verray, trewe wyf also.  
<span id="an_2286"></span> But, sire, ne be nat wrooth, al be it so,  
<span id="an_2287"></span> Though that he seyde he foond no good

<span id="an_2291"></span> "Ey! for verray God that nys but oon,  
<span id="an_2292"></span> What make ye so muche of Salomon?  
<span id="an_2293"></span> What though he made a temple, Goddes hous?  
<span id="an_2294"></span> What though he were riche and glorious?  
<span id="an_2295"></span> So made he eek a temple of false goddis.  
<span id="an_2296"></span> How myghte he do a thyng that moore forbode

<span id="an_2297"></span> Pardee, as faire as ye his name emplastre,  
<span id="an_2298"></span> He was a lecchour and an ydolastre,  
<span id="an_2299"></span> And in his elde he verray God forsook;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2300">2300</span></span> And if God
ne hadde, as seith the book,  
<span id="an_2301"></span> Yspared him for his fadres sake, he sholde  
<span id="an_2302"></span> Have lost his regne rather than he wolde.  
<span id="an_2303"></span> I sette right noght, of al the vileynye

<span id="an_2324"></span> So longe aboute the aleyes is he goon,  
<span id="an_2325"></span> Til he was come agaynes thilke pyrie  
<span id="an_2326"></span> Where as this Damyan sitteth ful myrie  
<span id="an_2327"></span> An heigh among the fresshe leves grene.  
<span id="an_2328"></span> This fresshe May, that is so bright and

<span id="an_2329"></span> Gan for to syke, and seyde, "Allas, my

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2330">2330</span></span> Now sire,"
quod she, "for aught that may bityde,

<span id="an_2335"></span> I telle yow wel, a womman in my plit  
<span id="an_2336"></span> May han to fruyt so greet an appetit

<span id="an_2341"></span> "But wolde ye vouche sauf, for Goddes sake,  
<span id="an_2342"></span> The pyrie inwith youre armes for to take,

<span id="an_2347"></span> Mighte I yow helpen with myn herte blood."  
<span id="an_2348"></span> He stoupeth doun, and on his bak she stood,  
<span id="an_2349"></span> And caughte hire by a twiste, and up she
gooth --  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2350">2350</span></span> Ladyes, I
prey yow that ye be nat wrooth;  
<span id="an_2351"></span> I kan nat glose, I am a rude man --  
<span id="an_2352"></span> And sodeynly anon this Damyan  
<span id="an_2353"></span> Gan pullen up the smok, and in he throng.  
<span id="an_2354"></span> And whan that Pluto saugh this grete wrong,  
<span id="an_2355"></span> To Januarie he gaf agayn his sighte,  
<span id="an_2356"></span> And made hym se as wel as evere he myghte.  
<span id="an_2357"></span> And whan that he hadde caught his sighte

<span id="an_2363"></span> But if I wolde speke uncurteisly;  
<span id="an_2364"></span> And up he yaf a roryng and a cry,  
<span id="an_2365"></span> As dooth the mooder whan the child shal

<span id="an_2366"></span> "Out! Help! Allas! Harrow!" he gan to crye,  
<span id="an_2367"></span> "O stronge lady stoore, what dostow?"  
<span id="an_2368"></span> And she answerde, "Sire, what eyleth yow?  
<span id="an_2369"></span> Have pacience and resoun in youre mynde.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2370">2370</span></span> I have yow
