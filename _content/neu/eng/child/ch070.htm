<PRE>

70A.1	WILLIE was a widow&#146;s son,
	And he wore a milk-white weed, O
	And weel could Willie read and write,
	Far better ride on steed. O
70A.2	Lady Margerie was the first lady
	That drank to him the wine,
	And aye as the healths gade round and round,
	&#145;Laddy, your love is mine.&#146;
70A.3	Lady Margerie was the first ladye
	That drank to him the beer,
	And aye as the healths gade round and round,
	&#145;Laddy, you&#146;re welcome here.&#146;
70A.4	&#145;You must come into my bower
	When the evening bells do ring,
	And you must come into my bower
	When the evening mass doth sing.&#146;
70A.5	He&#146;s taen four and twenty braid arrows,
	And laced them in a whang,
	And he&#146;s awa to Lady Margerie&#146;s bower,
	As fast as he can gang.
70A.6	He set ae foot on the wall,
	And the other on a stane,
	And he&#146;s killed a&#146; the king&#146;s life-guards,
	And he&#146;s killed them every man.
70A.7	&#145;Oh open, open, Lady Margerie,
	Open and let me in;
	The weet weets a&#146; my yellow hair,
	And the dew draps on my chin.&#146;
70A.8	With her feet as white as sleet
	She strode her bower within,
	And with her fingers long and small
	She&#146;s looten Sweet Willie in.
70A.9	She&#146;s louten down unto her foot
	To loose Sweet Willie&#146;s shoon;
	The buckles were sa stiff they wudna lowse,
	The blood had frozen in.
70A.10	&#145;O Willie, Willie, I fear that thou
	Has bred me dule and sorrow;
	The deed that thou has dune this nicht
	Will kythe upon the morrow.&#146;
70A.11	In then came her father dear,
	And a broad sword by his gare,
	And he&#146;s gien Willie, the widow&#146;s son,
	A deep wound and a sair.
70A.12	&#145;Lye yont, lye yont, Willie,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Your sweat weets a&#146; my side;
	Lye yont, lie yont, Willie,&#146; she says,
	&#145;For your sweat I downa bide.&#146;
70A.13	She turned her back unto the wa,
	Her face unto the room,
	And there she saw her auld father,
	Walking up and down.
70A.14	&#145;Woe be to you, father,&#146; she said,
	&#145;And an ill deed may you die!
	For ye&#146;ve killd Willie, the widow&#146;s son
	And he would have married me.&#146;
70A.15	She turned her back unto the room,
	Her face unto the wa,
	And with a deep and heavy sich
	Her heart it brak in twa.

70B.1	SWEET WILLIE was a widow&#146;s son,
	And milk-white was his weed;
	It sets him weel to bridle a horse,
	And better to saddle a steed, my dear,
	And better to saddle a steed.
70B.2	But he is on to Maisry&#146;s bower-door,
	And tirled at the pin:
	&#145;Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Lady Maisry,
	Ye&#146;ll open, let me come in.&#146;
70B.3	&#145;O who is this at my bower-door,
	Sae well that knows my name?&#146;
	&#145;It is your ain true-love, Willie,
	If ye love me, lat me in.&#146;
70B.4	Then huly, huly raise she up,
	For fear o making din,
	Then in her arms lang and bent,
	She caught sweet Willie in.
70B.5	She leand her low down to her toe,
	To loose her true-love&#146;s sheen,
	But cauld, cauld were the draps o bleed
	Fell fae his trusty brand.
70B.6	&#145;What frightfu sight is that, my love?
	A frightfu sight to see!
	What bluid is this on your sharp brand?
	O may ye not tell me?&#146;
70B.7	&#145;As I came thro the woods this night,
	The wolf maist worried me;
	O shoud I slain the wolf, Maisry?
	Or shoud the wolf slain me?&#146;
70B.8	They hadna kissd, nor love clapped,
	As lovers when they meet,
	Till up it starts her auld father,
	Out o his drowsy sleep.
70B.9	&#145;O what&#146;s become o my house-cock,
	Sae crouse at ane did craw?
	I wonder as much at my bold watch,
	That&#146;s nae shooting ower the wa.
70B.10	&#145;My gude house-cock, my only son,
	Heir ower my land sae free,
	If ony ruffian hae him slain,
	High hanged shall he be.&#146;
70B.11	Then he&#146;s on to Maisry&#146;s bower-door,
	And tirled at the pin:
	&#145;Ye sleep ye, wake ye, daughter Maisry,
	Ye&#146;ll open, lat me come in.&#146;
70B.12	Between the curtains and the wa
	She rowd her true-love then,
	And huly went she to the door,
	And let her father in.
70B.13	&#145;What&#146;s become o your maries, Maisry,
	Your bower it looks sae teem?
	What&#146;s become o your green claithing,
	Your beds they are sae thin?&#146;
70B.14	&#145;Gude forgie you, father,&#146; she said,
	&#145;I wish ye be&#146;t for sin;
	Sae aft as ye hae dreaded me,
	But never found me wrang.&#146;
70B.15	He turnd him right and round about,
	As he&#146;d been gaun awa;
	But sae nimbly as he slippet in
	Behind a screen sae sma.
70B.16	Maisry, thinking a&#146; dangers past,
	She to her love did say,
	&#145;Come, love, and take your silent rest;
	My auld father&#146;s away.&#146;
70B.17	Then baith lockd in each other&#146;s arms,
	They fell full fast asleep,
	When up it starts her auld father,
	And stood at their bed-feet.
70B.18	&#145;I think I hae the villain now
	That my dear son did slay;
	But I shall be revengd on him
	Before I see the day.&#146;
70B.19	Then he&#146;s drawn out a trusty brand,
	And stroakd it oer a stray,
	And thro and thro Sweet Willie&#146;s middle
	He&#146;s gart cauld iron gae.
70B.20	Then up it wakend Lady Maisry,
	Out o her drowsy sleep,
	And when she saw her true-love slain,
	She straight began to weep.
70B.21	&#145;O gude forgie you now, father,&#146; she said,
	&#145;I wish ye be&#146;t for sin;
	For I never lovd a love but ane,
	In my arms ye&#146;ve him slain.&#146;
70B.22	&#145;This night he&#146;s slain my gude bold watch,
	Thirty stout men and twa;
	Likewise he&#146;s slain your ae brother,
	To me was worth them a&#146;.
70B.23	&#145;If he has slain my ae brither,
	Himsell had a&#146; the blame,
	For mony a day he plots contriv&#146;d,
	To hae Sweet Willie slain.
70B.24	&#145;And tho he&#146;s slain your gude bold watch,
	He might hae been forgien;
	They came on him in armour bright,
	When he was but alane.&#146;
70B.25	Nae meen was made for this young knight,
	In bower where he lay slain,
	But a&#146; was for sweet Maisry bright,
	In fields where she ran brain.
