20[O.12]	One was drest in scarlet fine,
	And the other[s was naked] as ere they was born.
20[O.13]	&#145;O mother, O mother, if these children was mine,
	I wold dress them [in] scarlet fine.&#146;
20[O.14]	&#145;O mother, O mother, when we was thine,
	You did not dress [us] in scarlet fine.
20[O.15]	&#145;You set your back against a tree,
	And there you endured great misery.
20[O.16]	&#145;You set your foot against a thorne,
	And there you had us pritty babes born.
20[O.17]	&#145;You took your filliting off your head,
	And there you bound us, hand to leg.
20[O.18]	&#145;You had a penknife long and sharp,
	And there you stuck us to the heart.
20[O.19]	&#145;You dug a grave, it was long and deep,
	And there you laid us in to sleep.
20[O.20]	The coldest earth it was our bed,
	The green grass was our coverlid.
20[O.21]	&#145;O mother, mother, for your sin
	Heaven-gate you shall not enter in.
20[O.22]	&#145;O mother, mother, for your sin
	Hell-gates stands open to let you in.&#146;
20[O.23]	The lady&#146;s cheeks lookd pale and wan,
	&#145;Alass I,&#146; said she, &#146;what have I done!&#146;
20[O.24]	She tore her silken locks of hair,
	And dy&#146;d away in sad despair.
20[O.25]	Young ladies all, of beauty bright,
	Take warning by her last good-night.

20[Q.2]	She leaned her back against the stile,
	There she had two pretty babes born.
20[Q.3]	And she had nothing to lap &#146;em in,
	But she had a penknife sharp and keen.
20[Q.4]	. . . . . . . . .
	There she stabbed them right through the heart.
20[Q.5]	She wiped the penknife in the sludge;
	The more she wiped it, the more the blood showed.
20[Q.6]	As she was walking in her own father&#146;s park,
	She saw two pretty babes playing with a ball.
20[Q.7]	&#145;Pretty babes, pretty babes, if you were mine,
	I&#146;d dress you up in silks so fine.&#146;
20[Q.8]	&#145;Dear mother, dear mother, [when we were thine,]
	You dressed us not in silks so fine.
20[Q.9]	&#145;Here we go to the heavens so high,
	You&#146;ll go to bad when you do die.&#146;
