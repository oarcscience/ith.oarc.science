# 114A: Johnie Cock


    114A.1   JOHNY he has risen up i the morn,
         Calls for water to wash his hands;
         But little knew he that his bloody hounds
         Were bound in iron bands. bands
         Were bound in iron bands
    114A.2   Johnys mother has gotten word o that,
         And care-bed she has taen:
         O Johny, for my benison,
         I beg youl stay at hame;
         For the wine so red, and the well baken bread,
         My Johny shall want nane.
    114A.3   There are seven forsters at Pickeram Side,
         At Pickeram where they dwell,
         And for a drop of thy hearts bluid
         They wad ride the fords of hell.
    114A.4   Johny hes gotten word of that,
         And hes turnd wondrous keen;
         Hes put off the red scarlett,
         And hes put on the Lincolm green.
    114A.5   With a sheaf of arrows by his side,
         And a bent bow in his hand,
         Hes mounted on a prancing steed,
         And he has ridden fast oer the strand.
    114A.6   Hes up i Braidhouplee, and down i Bradyslee,
         And under a buss o broom,
         And there he found a good dun deer,
         Feeding in a buss of ling.
    114A.7   Johny shot, and the dun deer lap,
         And she lap wondrous wide,
         Until they came to the wan water,
         And he stemd her of her pride.
    114A.8   He as taen out the little pen-knife,
         Twas full three quarters long,
         And he has taen out of that dun deer
         The liver bot and the tongue.
    114A.9   They eat of the flesh, and they drank of the blood,
         And the blood it was so sweet,
         Which caused Johny and his bloody hounds
         To fall in a deep sleep.
    114A.10  By then came an old palmer,
         And an ill death may he die!
         For hes away to Pickram Side,
         As fast as he can drie.
    114A.11  What news, what news? says the Seven Forsters,
         What news have ye brought to me?
         I have noe news, the palmer said,
         But what I saw with my eye.
    114A.12  High up i Bradyslee, low down i Bradisslee,
         And under a buss of scroggs,
         O there I spied a well-wight man,
         Sleeping among his dogs.
    114A.13  His coat it was of light Lincolm,
         And his breeches of the same,
         His shoes of the American leather,
         And gold buckles tying them.
    114A.14  Up bespake the Seven Forsters,
         Up bespake they ane and a:
         O that is Johny o Cockleys Well,
         And near him we will draw.
    114A.15  O the first y stroke that they gae him,
         They struck him off by the knee;
         Then up bespake his sisters son:
         O the next ll gar him die!
    114A.16  O some they count ye well-wight men,
         But I do count ye nane;
         For you might well ha wakend me,
         And askd gin I wad be taen.
    114A.17  The wildest wolf in aw this wood
         Wad not ha done so by me;
         Shed ha wet her foot ith wan water,
         And sprinkled it oer my brae,
         And if that wad not ha wakend me,
         She wad ha gone and let me be.
    114A.18  O bows of yew, if ye be true,
         In London, where ye were bought,
         Fingers five, get up belive,
         Manhuid shall fail me nought.
    114A.19  He has killd the Seven Forsters,
         He has killd them all but ane,
         And that wan scarce to Pickeram Side,
         To carry the bode-words hame.
    114A.20  Is there never a boy in a this wood
         That will tell what I can say;
         That will go to Cockleys Well,
         Tell my mither to fetch me away?
    114A.21  There was a boy into that wood,
         That carried the tidings away,
         And many ae was the well-wight man
         At the fetching o Johny away.

### 114B: Johnie Cock


    114B.1   FIFTEEN foresters in the Braid alow,
         And they are wondrous fell;
         To get a drop of Johnnys heart-bluid,
         They would sink a their souls to hell.
    114B.2   Johnny Cock has gotten word of this,
         And he is wondrous keen;
         He[s] custan off the red scarlet,
         And on the Linkum green.
    114B.3   And he is ridden oer muir and muss,
         And over mountains high,
         Till he came to yon wan water,
         And there Johnny Cock did lie.
    114B.4   They have ridden oer muir and muss,
         And over mountains high,
         Till they met wi an old palmer,
         Was walking along the way.
    114B.5   What news, what news, old palmer?
         What news have you to me?
         Yonder is one of the proudest wed sons
         That ever my eyes did see.
         * * * * *
    114B.6   Hes taen out a horn from his side,
         And he blew both loud and shrill,
         Till a the fifteen foresters
         Heard Johnny Cock blaw his horn.
    114B.7   They have sworn a bluidy oath,
         And they swore all in one,
         That there was not a man among them a
         Would blaw such a blast as yon.
    114B.8   And they have ridden oer muir and muss,
         And over mountains high,
         Till they came to yon wan water,
         Where Johnny Cock did lie.
    114B.9   They have shotten little Johnny Cock,
         A little above the ee:
         . . . . .
         For doing the like to me.
    114B.10  Theres not a wolf in a the wood
         Woud ha done the like to me;
         Shed ha dipped her foot in coll water,
         And strinkled above my ee,
         And if I would not have waked for that,
         Shed ha gane and let me be.
    114B.11  But fingers five, come here, [come here,]
         And faint heart fail me nought,
         And silver strings, value me sma things,
         Till I get all this vengeance rowght!
    114B.12  He ha[s] shot a the fifteen foresters,
         Left never a one but one,
         And he broke the ribs a that anes side,
         And let him take tiding home.
    114B.13  . . . a bird in a the wood
         Could sing as I could say,
         It would go in to my mothers bower,
         And bid her kiss me, and take me away.

         Wounded Johnny aboun the bree.
    114C.5   Woe be to you, foresters,
         And an ill death may you die!
         For there would not a wolf in a the wood
         Have done the like to me.
    114C.6   For twould ha put its foot in the coll water
         And ha strinkled it on my bree,
         And gin that would not have done,

         Gar loose to me the gude graie dogs,
         That are bound wi iron bands.

    114F.4   But Johnies buskt up his gude bend bow,
         His arrows, ane by ane,
         And he has gane to Durrisdeer,
         To hunt the dun deer down.
    114F.5   As he came down by Merriemass,
         And in by the benty line,
         There has he espied a deer lying,
         Aneath a bush of ling.
    114F.6   Johnie he shot, and the dun deer lap,
         And he wounded her on the side,
         But atween the water and the brae,
         His hounds they laid her pride.
    114F.7   And Johnie has bryttled the deer sae weel
         That hes had out her liver and lungs,
         And wi these he has feasted his bludey hounds
         As if they had been erls sons.

         And drank sae much o the blude,
         That Johnie and his bludey hounds
         Fell asleep as they had been dead.

         An ill death mote he die!
         For hes awa to Hislinton,
         Where the Seven Foresters did lie.
    114F.10  What news, what news, ye gray-headed carle?
         What news bring ye to me?
         I bring nae news, said the gray-headed carle,
         Save what these eyes did see.
    114F.11  As I came down by Merriemass,
         And down amang the scroggs,
         The bonniest childe that ever I saw

         Was o the holland fine;
         The doublet which was over that
         Was o the Lincome twine.

         Were o the gowd sae gude;
         The gude graie hounds he lay amang,
         Their mouths were dyed wi blude.

         The heid man ower them a:
         If this be Johnie o Breadislee,
         Nae nearer will we draw.
    114F.15  But up and spak the sixth forester,
         His sisters son was he:
         If this be Johnie o Breadislee,
         We soon shall gar him die.
    114F.16  The first flight of arrows the foresters shot,
         They wounded him on the knee;
         And out and spak the seventh forester,
         The next will gar him die.
    114F.17  Johnies set his back against an aik,
         His fute against a stane,
         And he has slain the Seven Foresters,
         He has slain them a but ane.
    114F.18  He has broke three ribs in that anes side,
         But and his collar bane;
         Hes laod him twa-fald ower his steed,
         Bade him carry the tidings hame.
    114F.19  O is there na a bonnie bird
         Can sing as I can say,
         Could flee away to my mothers bower,
         And tell to fetch Johnie away?
    114F.20  The starling flew to his mothers window-stane,
         It whistled and it sang,
         And aye the ower-word o the tune
         Was, Johnie tarries lang!
    114F.21  They made a rod o the hazel-bush,
         Another o the slae-thorn tree,
         And mony, mony were the men
         At fetching our Johnie.
    114F.22  Then out and spake his auld mother,
         And fast her teirs did fa;
         Ye wad nae be warnd, my son Johnie,
         Frae the hunting to bide awa.
    114F.23  Aft hae I brought to Breadislee
         The less gear and the mair,
         But I neer brought to Breadislee
         What grieved my heart sae sair.
    114F.24  But wae betyde that silly auld carle,
         An ill death shall he die;
         For the highest tree on Merriemass
         Shall be his mornings fee.
    114F.25  Now Johnies gude bend bow is broke,
         And his gude graie dogs are slain,
         And his bodie lies dead in Durrisdeer,
         And his hunting it is done.

    114H.2   Win up, win up, my bluidy dogs,
         Win up, and be unbound,
         And we will on to Brides Braidmuir,
         And ding the dun deer down.
    114H.3   When his mother got word o that,
         Then she took bed and lay;
         Says, Johnnie, my son, for my blessing,
         Yell stay at hame this day.
    114H.4   Theres baken bread and brown ale
         Shall be at your command;
         Yell win your mithers blythe blessing,
         To the Brides Braidmuir nae gang.
    114H.5   Mony are my friends, mither,
         Though thousands were my foe;
         Betide me life, betide me death,
         To the Brides Braidmuir Ill go.
    114H.6   The sark that was on Johnnies back
         Was o the cambric fine;
         The belt that was around his middle
         Wi pearlins it did shine.
    114H.7   The coat that was upon his back
         Was o the linsey brown;
         And hes awa to the Brides Braidmuir,
         To ding the dun deer down.
    114H.8   Johnnie lookd east, Johnnie lookd west,
         And turnd him round and round,
         And there he saw the kings dun deer,
         Was cowing the bush o brune.
    114H.9   Johnnie shot, and the dun deer lap,
         He wounded her in the side;
         Between him and yon burnie-bank,
         Johnnie he laid her pride.
    114H.10  He ate sae muckle o the venison,
         He drank sae muckle bleed,
         Till he lay down between his hounds,
         And slept as hed been dead.
    114H.11  But by there came a stane-auld man,
         An ill death mat he dee!
         For he is on to the Seven Foresters,
         As fast as gang could he.
    114H.12  What news, what news, ye stane-auld man?
         What news hae ye brought you wi?
         Nae news, nae news, ye seven foresters,
         But what your eyes will see.
    114H.13  As I gaed i yon rough thick hedge,
         Amang yon bramly scroggs,
         The fairest youth that eer I saw
         Lay sleeping between his dogs.
    114H.14  The sark that was upon his back
         Was o the cambric fine;
         The belt that was around his middle
         Wi pearlins it did shine.
    114H.15  Then out it speaks the first forester:
         Whether this be true or no,
         O if its Johnnie o Cocklesmuir,
         Nae forder need we go.
    114H.16  Out it spake the second forester,
         A fierce fellow was he:
         Betide me life, betide me death,
         This youth well go and see.
    114H.17  As they gaed in yon rough thick hedge,
         And down yon forest gay,
         They came to that very same place
         Where John o Cockis he lay.
    114H.18  The first an shot they shot at him,
         They wounded him in the thigh;
         Out spake the first foresters son:
         By the next shot he maun die.
    114H.19  O stand ye true, my trusty bow,
         And stout steel never fail!
         Avenge me now on all my foes,
         Who have my life i bail.
    114H.20  Then Johnnie killd six foresters,
         And wounded the seventh sair;
         Then drew a stroke at the stane-auld man,
         That words he neer spake mair.
    114H.21  His mothers parrot in window sat,
         She whistled and she sang,
         And aye the owerturn o the note,
         Young Johnnies biding lang.
    114H.22  When this reached the kings own ears,
         It grievd him wondrous sair;
         Says, Id rather theyd hurt my subjects all
         Than Johnnie o Cocklesmuir.
    114H.23  But where are all my wall-wight men,
         That I pay meat and fee,
         Will gang the morn to Johnnies castle,
         See how the cause may be.
    114H.24  Then hes calld Johnnie up to court,
         Treated him handsomelie,
         And now to hunt in the Brides Braidmuir,
         For life has license free.
