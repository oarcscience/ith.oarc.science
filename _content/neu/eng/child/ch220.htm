220A.1	 OUR king he has a secret to tell,
	 And ay well keepit it must be:
	 The English lords are coming down
	 To dance and win the victory.
220A.2	 Our king has cry&#146;d a noble cry,
	 And ay well keepit it must be:
	 &#145;Gar saddle ye, and bring to me
	 The bonny lass of Anglesey.&#146;
220A.3	 Up she starts, as white as the milk,
	 Between him and his company:
	 What is the thing I hae to ask,
	 If I sould win the victory?&#146;
220A.4	 &#145;Fifteen ploughs but and a mill
	 I gie thee till the day thou die,
	 And the fairest knight in a&#146; my court
	 To chuse thy husband for to be.&#146;
220A.5	 She&#146;s taen the fifteen lord[s] by the hand,
	 Saying, &#145;Will ye come dance with me?&#146;
	 But on the morn at ten o&#146;clock
	 They gave it oer most shamefully.
220A.6	 Up then rais the fifteenth lord-+--+-
	 I wat an angry man was he-+--+-
	 Laid by frae him his belt and sword,
	 And to the floor gaed manfully.
220A.7	 He said, &#145;My feet shall be my dead
	 Before she win the victory;&#146;
	 But before &#146;twas ten o&#146;clock at night
	 He gaed it oer as shamefully.

	 And well attended it maun be:
	 &#145;Come saddle ye, and bring to me
	 The bonny lass o Englessie.&#146;
