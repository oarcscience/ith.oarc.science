25B.1	&#145;O Willie my son, what makes you sae sad?&#146;
      Refrain:	As the sun shines over the valley
	&#145;I lye sarely sick for the love of a maid.&#146;
      Refrain:	Amang the blue flowers and the yellow
25B.2	&#145;Were she an heiress or lady sae free,
	That she will take no pity on thee?
25B.3	&#145;O Willie, my son, I&#146;ll learn you a wile,
	How this fair maid ye may beguile.
25B.4	&#145;Ye&#146;ll gie the principal bellman a groat,
	And ye&#146;ll gar him cry your dead lyke-wake.&#146;
25B.5	Then he gae the principal bellman a groat,
	He bade him cry his dead lyke-wake.
25B.6	This maiden she stood till she heard it a&#146;,
	And down frae her cheeks the tears did fa.
25B.7	She is hame to her father&#146;s ain bower:
	&#145;I&#146;ll gang to yon lyke-wake ae single hour.&#146;
25B.8	&#145;Ye must take with you your ain brither John;
	It&#146;s not meet for maidens to venture alone.&#146;
25B.9	&#145;I&#146;ll not take with me my brither John,
	But I&#146;ll gang along, myself all alone.&#146;
25B.10	When she came to young Willie&#146;s yate,
	His seven brithers were standing thereat.
25B.11	Then they did conduct her into the ha,
	Amang the weepers and merry mourners a&#146;.
25B.12	When she lifted up the covering sae red,
	With melancholy countenance to look on the dead,
25B.13	He&#146;s taen her in his arms, laid her gainst the wa,
	Says, &#145;Lye ye here, fair maid, till day.&#146;
25B.14	&#145;O spare me, O spare me, but this single night,
	And let me gang hame a maiden sae bright.&#146;
25B.15	&#145;Tho all your kin were about your bower,
	Ye shall not be a maiden ae single hour.
25B.16	&#145;Fair maid, ye came here without a convoy,
	But ye shall return wi a horse and a boy.
25B.17	&#145;Ye came here a maiden sae mild,
	But ye shall gae hame a wedded wife with child.&#146;

25[E].1	&#145;If my love loves me, she lets me not know,
	That is a dowie chance;
	I wish that I the same could do,
	Tho my love were in France, France,
	Tho my love were in France.
25[E.2]	&#145;O lang think I, and very lang,
	And lang think I, I true;
	But lang and langer will I think
	Or my love o me rue.
25[E.3]	&#145;I will write a broad letter,
	And write it sae perfite,
	That an she winna o me rue,
	I&#146;ll bid her come to my lyke.&#146;
25[E.4]	Then he has written a broad letter,
	And seald it wi his hand,
	And sent it on to his true love,
	As fast as boy could gang.
25[E.5]	When she looked the letter upon,
	A light laugh then gae she;
	But ere she read it to an end,
	The tear blinded her ee.
25[E.6]	&#145;O saddle to me a steed, father,
	O saddle to me a steed;
	For word is come to me this night,
	That my true love is dead.&#146;
25[E.7]	&#145;The steeds are in the stable, daughter,
	The keys are casten by;
	Ye cannot won to-night, daughter,
	To-morrow ye&#146;se won away.&#146;
25[E.8]	She has cut aff her yellow locks,
	A little aboon her ee,
	And she is on to Willie&#146;s lyke,
	As fast as gang could she.
25[E.9]	As she gaed ower yon high hill head,
	She saw a dowie light;
	It was the candles at Willie&#146;s lyke,
	And torches burning bright.
25[E.10]	Three o Willie&#146;s eldest brothers
	Were making for him a bier;
	One half o it was gude red gowd,
	The other siller clear.
25[E.11]	Three o Willie&#146;s eldest sisters
	Were making for him a sark;
	The one half o it was cambric fine,
	The other needle wark.
25[E.12]	Out spake the youngest o his sisters,
	As she stood on the fleer:
	How happy would our brother been,
	If ye&#146;d been sooner here!
25[E.13]	She lifted up the green covering,
	And gae him kisses three;
	Then he lookd up into her face,
	The blythe blink in his ee.
25[E.14]	O then he started to his feet,
	And thus to her said he:
	Fair Annie, since we&#146;re met again,
	Parted nae mair we&#146;se be.
