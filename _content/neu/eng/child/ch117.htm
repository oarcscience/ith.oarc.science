<PRE>

117A.1	 LYTHE and listin, gentilmen,
	 That be of frebore blode;
	 I shall you tel of a gode yeman,
	 His name was Robyn Hode.
117A.2	 Robyn was a prude outlaw,
	 [Whyles he walked on grounde;
	 So curteyse an outlawe] as he was one
	 Was never non founde.
117A.3	 Robyn stode in Bernesdale,
	 And lenyd hym to a tre;
	 And bi hym stode Litell Johnn,
	 A gode yeman was he.
117A.4	 And alsoo dyd gode Scarlok,
	 And Much, the miller&#146;s son;
	 There was none ynch of his bodi
	 But it was worth a grome.
117A.5	 Than bespake Lytell Johnn
	 All vntoo Robyn Hode:
	 Maister, and ye wolde dyne betyme
	 It wolde doo you moche gode.
117A.6	 Than bespake hym gode Robyn:
	 To dyne haue I noo lust,
	 Till that I haue som bolde baron,
	 Or som vnkouth gest.
117A.7	 . . . . . . .
	 That may pay for the best,
	 Or som knyght or [som] squyer,
	 That dwelleth here bi west.
117A.8	 A gode maner than had Robyn;
	 In londe where that he were,
	 Euery day or he wold dyne
	 Thre messis wolde he here.
117A.9	 The one in the worship of the Fader,
	 And another of the Holy Gost,
	 The thirde of Our der  Lady,
	 That he loued allther moste.
117A.10	 Robyn loued Oure der  Lady;
	 For dout of dydly synne,
	 Wolde he neuer do compani harme
	 That any woman was in.
117A.11	 &#145;Maistar,&#146; than sayde Lytil Johnn,
	 &#145;And we our borde shal sprede,
	 Tell vs wheder that we shal go,
	 And what life that we shall lede.
117A.12	 &#145;Where we shall take, where we shall leue,
	 Where we shall abide behynde;
	 Where we shall robbe, where we shal reue,
	 Where we shal bete and bynde.&#146;
117A.13	 &#145;Therof no force,&#146; than sayde Robyn;
	 &#145;We shall do well inowe;
	 But loke ye do no husbonde harme,
	 That tilleth with his ploughe.
117A.14	 &#145;No more ye shall no gode yeman
	 That walketh by gren -wode shawe;
	 Ne no knyght ne no squyer
	 That wol be a gode felawe.
117A.15	 &#145;These bisshoppes and these archebishoppes,
	 Ye shall them bete and bynde;
	 The hy  sherif of Notyingham,
	 Hym holde ye in your mynde.&#146;
117A.16	 &#145;This worde shalbe holde,&#146; sayde Lytell Johnn,
	 &#145;And this lesson we shall lere;
	 It is fer dayes ; God sende vs a gest,
	 That we were at oure dynere!&#146;
117A.17	 &#145;Take thy gode bowe in thy honde,&#146; sayde Rob[yn];
	 &#145;Late Much wende with the;
	 And so shal Willyam Scarlo[k],
	 And no man abyde with me.
117A.18	 &#145;And walke vp to the Saylis,
	 And so to Watlingr Stret[e],
	 And wayte after some vnkuth gest,
	 Vp chaunce ye may them mete.
117A.19	 &#145;Be he erle, or ani baron,
	 Abbot, or ani knyght,
	 Bringhe hym to lodge to me;
	 His dyner shall be dight.&#146;
117A.20	 They wente vp to the Saylis,
	 These yeman all thre;
	 They loked est, they loke[d] weest;
	 They myght no man see.
117A.21	 But as they loked in to Bernysdale,
	 Bi a dern  strete,
	 Than came a knyght ridinghe;
	 Full sone they gan hym mete.
117A.22	 All dreri was his semblaunce,
	 And lytell was his pryde;
	 His one fote in the styrop stode,
	 That othere wauyd beside.
117A.23	 His hode hanged in his iyn two;
	 He rode in symple aray;
	 A soriar man than he was one
	 Rode neuer in somer day.
117A.24	 Litell Johnn was full curteyes,
	 And sette hym on his kne:
	 &#145;Welcom be ye, gentyll knyght,
	 Welcom ar ye to me.
117A.25	 &#145;Welcom be thou to gren  wode,
	 Hend  knyght and fre;
	 My maister hath abiden you fastinge,
	 Syr, al these our s thre.&#146;
117A.26	 &#145;Who is thy maister?&#146; sayde the knyght;
	 Johnn sayde, Robyn Hode;
	 &#145;He is [a] gode yoman,&#146; sayde the knyght,
	 &#145;Of hym haue I herde moche gode.
117A.27	 &#145;I graunte,&#146; he sayde, &#146;with you to wende,
	 My bretherne, all in fere;
	 My purpos was to haue dyned to day
	 At Blith or Dancastere.&#146;
117A.28	 Furth than went this gentyl knight,
	 With a carefull chere;
	 The teris oute of his iyen ran,
	 And fell downe by his lere.
117A.29	 They  brought hym to the lodg -dore;
	 Whan Robyn hym gan see,
	 Full curtesly dyd of his hode
	 And sette hym on his knee.
117A.30	 &#145;Welcome, sir knight,&#146; than sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;Welcome art thou to me;
	 I haue abyden you fastinge, sir,
	 All these ouris thre.&#146;
117A.31	 Than answered the gentyll knight,
	 With word s fayre and fre;
	 God the saue, goode Robyn,
	 And all thy fayre meyn .
117A.32	 They wasshed togeder and wyped bothe,
	 And sette to theyr dynere;
	 Brede and wyne they had right ynoughe,
	 And noumbles of the dere.
117A.33	 Swannes and fessauntes they had full gode,
	 And foules of the ryuere;
	 There fayled none so litell a birde
	 That euer was bred on bryre.
117A.34	 &#145;Do gladly, sir knight,&#146; sayde Robyn;
	 &#145;Gramarcy, sir,&#146; sayde he;
	 &#145;Suche a dinere had I nat
	 Of all these wekys thre.
117A.35	 &#145;If I come ageyne, Robyn,
	 Here by thys contr ,
	 As gode a dyner I shall the make
	 As that thou haest made to me.&#146;
117A.36	 &#145;Gramarcy, knyght,&#146; sayde Robyn;
	 &#145;My dyner whan that I it haue,
	 I was neuer so gredy, bi dere worthy God,
	 My dyner for to craue.
117A.37	 &#145;But pay or ye wende,&#146; sayde Robyn;
	 &#145;Me thynketh it is gode ryght;
	 It was neuer the maner, by dere worthi God,
	 A yoman to pay for a knyhht.&#146;
117A.38	 &#145;I haue nought in my coffers,&#146; saide the knyght,
	 &#145;That I may profer for shame:&#146;
	 &#145;Litell Johnn, go loke,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;Ne let nat for no blame.
117A.39	 &#145;Tel me truth,&#146; than saide Robyn,
	 &#145;So God haue parte of the:&#146;
	 &#145;I haue no more but ten shelynges,&#146; sayde the knyght,
	 &#145;So God haue parte of me.&#146;
117A.40	 If thou hast no more,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;I woll nat one peny;
	 And yf thou haue nede of any more,
	 More shall I lend the.
117A.41	 &#145;Go nowe furth, Littell Johnn,
	 The truth tell thou me;
	 If there be no more but ten shelinges,
	 No peny that I se.&#146;
117A.42	 Lyttell Johnn sprede downe hys mantell
	 Full fayre vpon the grounde,
	 And there he fonde in the knyght s cofer
	 But euen halfe [a] pounde.
117A.43	 Littell Johnn let it lye full styll,
	 And went to hys maysteer [full] lowe;
	 &#145;What tidyng s, Johnn?&#146; sayde Robyn;
	 &#145;Sir, the knyght is true inowe.&#146;
117A.44	 &#145;Fyll of the best wine,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;The knyght shall begynne;
	 Moche wonder thinketh me
	 Thy clot[h]ynge is so thin[n]e.
117A.45	 &#145;Tell me [one] worde,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;And counsel shal it be;
	 I trowe thou warte made a knyght of force,
	 Or ellys of yemanry.
117A.46	 &#145;Or ellys thou hast bene a sori husbande,
	 And lyued in stroke and stryfe;
	 An okerer, or ellis a lechoure,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;Wyth wronge hast led thy lyfe.&#146;
117A.47	 &#145;I am none of those,&#146; sayde the knyght,
	 &#145;By God that mad  me;
	 An hundred wynter here before
	 Myn auncetres knyghtes haue be.
117A.48	 &#145;But oft it hath befal, Robyn,
	 A man hath be disgrate;
	 But God that sitteth in heuen aboue
	 May amende his state.
117A.49	 &#145;Withyn this two yere, Robyne,&#146; he sayde,
	 &#145;My neghbours well it knowe,
	 Foure hundred pounde of gode money
	 Ful well than myght I spende.
117A.50	 &#145;Nowe haue I no gode,&#146; saide the knyght,
	 &#145;God hath shaped such an ende,
	 But my chyldren and my wyfe,
	 Tyll God yt may amende.&#146;
117A.51	 &#145;In what maner,&#146; than sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;Hast thou lorne thy rychesse?&#146;
	 &#145;For my great  foly,&#146; he sayde,
	 &#145;And for my kynd[ ]nesse.
117A.52	 &#145;I hade a sone, forsoth, Robyn,
	 That shulde hau[e] ben myn ayre,
	 Whanne he was twenty wynter olde,
	 In felde wolde iust full fayre.
117A.53	 &#145;He slewe a knyght of Lancaster,
	 And a squyer bolde;
	 For to saue hym in his ryght
	 My godes both sette and solde.
117A.54	 &#145;My londes both sette to wedde, Robyn,
	 Vntyll a certayn day,
	 To a ryche abbot here besyde
	 Of Seynt Mari Abbey.&#146;
117A.55	 &#145;What is the som?&#146; sayde Robyn;
	 &#145;Trouth than tell thou me;&#146;
	 &#145;Sir,&#146; he sayde, &#146;Foure hundred pounde;
	 The abbot told it to me.&#146;
117A.56	 &#145;Nowe and thou lese thy lond,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;What woll fall of the?&#146;
	 &#145;Hastely I wol me buske,&#146; sayd the knyght,
	 &#145;Ouer the salt  see,
117A.57	 &#145;And se w[h]ere Criste was quyke and dede,
	 On the mount of Caluer ;
	 Fare wel, frende, and haue gode day;
	 It may no better be.&#146;

	 He wolde haue gone hys way:
	 &#145;Farewel, frende, and haue gode day;
	 I ne haue no more to pay.&#146;
117A.59	 &#145;Where be thy frend s?&#146; sayde Robyn:
	 &#145;Syr, neuer one wol me knowe;
	 While I was ryche ynowe at home
	 Great boste than wolde they blowe.
117A.60	 &#145;And nowe they renne away fro me,
	 As bestis on a rowe;
	 They take no more hede of me
	 Thanne they had me neuer sawe.&#146;
117A.61	 For ruthe thanne wept Litell Johnn,
	 Scarlok and Muche in fere;
	 &#145;Fyl of the best wyne,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;For here is a symple chere.
117A.62	 &#145;Hast thou any frende,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;Thy borowe that wold  be?&#146;
	 &#145;I haue none,&#146; than sayde the knyght,
	 &#145;But God that dyed on tree.&#146;
117A.63	 &#145;Do away thy iapis,&#146; than sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;Thereof wol I right none;
	 Wenest thou I wolde haue God to borowe,
	 Peter, Poule, or Johnn?
117A.64	 &#145;Nay, by hym that me made,
	 And shope both sonne and mone,
	 Fynde me a better borowe,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;Or money getest thou none.&#146;
117A.65	 &#145;I haue none other,&#146; sayde the knyght,
	 &#145;The sothe for to say,
	 But yf yt be Our der  Lady;
	 She fayled me neuer or thys day.&#146;

	 &#145;To seche all Englonde thorowe,
	 Yet fonde I neuer to my pay
	 A moche better borowe.
117A.67	 &#145;Come nowe furth, Litell Johnn,
	 And go to my tresour ,
	 And bringe me foure hundered pound,
	 And loke well tolde it be.&#146;
117A.68	 Furth than went Litell Johnn,
	 And Scarlok went before;
	 He tolde oute foure hundred pounde
	 By eight and twenty score.
117A.69	 &#145;Is thys well tolde?&#146; sayde [litell] Much;
	 Johnn sayde, &#145;What gre[ue]th the?
	 It is almus to helpe a gentyll knyght,
	 That is fal in pouert .
117A.70	 &#145;Master,&#146; than sayde Lityll John,
	 &#145;His clothinge is full thynne;
	 Ye must gyue the knight a lyueray,
	 To lappe his body therin.
117A.71	 &#145;For ye haue scarlet and grene, mayster,
	 And man[y] a riche aray;

	 So ryche, I dare well say.&#146;
117A.72	 &#145;Take hym thre yerdes of euery colour,
	 And loke well mete that it be;&#146;
	 Lytell Johnn toke none other mesure
	 But his bow -tree.

	 He lep d foot s three;
	 &#145;What deuyll s drapar,&#146; sayid litell Muche,
	 &#145;Thynkest thou for to be?&#146;
117A.74	 Scarlok stode full stil and loughe,
	 And sayd, By God Almyght,
	 Johnn may gyue hym gode mesure,
	 For it costeth hym but lyght.
117A.75	 &#145;Mayster,&#146; than said Litell Johnn
	 To gentill Robyn Hode,
	 &#145;Ye must giue the knig[h]t a hors,
	 To lede home this gode.&#146;
117A.76	 &#145;Take hym a gray coursar,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;And a saydle newe;
	 He is Oure Ladye&#146;s messangere;

	 &#145;And a peyre of bot s,&#146; sayde Scarlock,
	 &#145;For he is a gentyll knight.&#146;
117A.78	 &#145;What shalt thou gyue hym, Litell John?&#146; said Robyn;

	 To pray for all this company;
	 God bringe hym out of tene.&#146;
117A.79	 &#145;Whan shal mi day be,&#146; said the knight,
	 &#145;Sir, and your wyll be?&#146;
	 &#145;This day twelue moneth,&#146; saide Robyn,
	 &#145;Vnder this gren -wode tre.
117A.80	 &#145;It were greate sham ,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;A knight alone to ryde,
	 Without  squyre, yoman, or page,
	 To walk  by his syde.
117A.81	 &#145;I shall the lende Litell John, my man,
	 For he shalbe thy knaue;
	 In a yema[n]&#146;s stede he may the stande,
	 If thou greate ned  haue.&#146;
117A.82	 Now is the knight gone on his way;
	 This game hym thought full gode;
	 Whanne he loked on Bernesdale
	 He blessyd Robyn Hode.
117A.83	 And whanne he thought on Bernysdale,
	 On Scarlok, Much, and Johnn,
	 He blyssyd them for the best company
	 That euer he in come.
117A.84	 Then spake that gentyll knyght,
	 To Lytel Johan gan he saye,
	 To-morrowe I must to Yorke toune,
	 To Saynt Mary abbay.
117A.85	 And to the abbot of that place
	 Foure hondred pounde I must pay;
	 And but I be there vpon this nyght
	 My londe is lost for ay.
117A.86	 The abbot sayd to his couent,
	 There he stode on grounde,
	 This day twelfe moneth came there a knyght
	 And borowed foure hondred pounde.
117A.87	 [He borowed foure hondred pounde,]
	 Upon all his lond  fre;
	 But he come this ylk  day
	 Dysheryte shall he be.
117A.88	 &#145;It is full erely,&#146; sayd the pryoure,
	 &#145;The day is not yet ferre gone;
	 I had leuer to pay an hondred pounde,
	 And lay downe anone.
117A.89	 &#145;The knyght is ferre beyonde the see,
	 In Englonde is his ryght,
	 And suffreth honger and colde,
	 And many a sory nyght.

	 &#145;So to haue his londe;
	 And ye be so lyght of your consyence,
	 Ye do to hym moch wronge.&#146;
117A.91	 &#145;Thou arte euer in my berde,&#146; sayd the abbot,
	 &#145;By God and Saynt Rycharde;&#146;
	 With that cam in a fat-heded monke,
	 The heygh selerer.
117A.92	 &#145;He is dede or hanged,&#146; sayd the monke,
	 &#145;By God that bought me dere,
	 And we shall haue to spende in this place
	 Foure hondred pounde by yere.&#146;
117A.93	 The abbot and the hy selerer
	 Stert  forthe full bolde,
	 The [hye] iustyce of Englonde
	 The abbot there dyde holde.
117A.94	 The hy  iustyce and many mo

	 Holy all the knyght s det,
	 To put that knyght to wronge.
117A.95	 They demed the knyght wonder sore,

	 The porter was redy hymselfe,
	 And welcomed them euerychone.
117A.99	 &#145;Welcome, syr knyght,&#146; sayd the porter;
	 &#145;My lorde to mete is he,
	 And so is many a gentyll man,

117A.102	Lord s were to mete isette
	 In that abbotes hall;
	 The knyght went forth and kneled downe,
	 And salued them grete and small.

117A.300	The outlawes shot was so stronge
	 That no man myght them dryue,
	 And the proud[ ] sheryf s men,

117A.301	Robyn sawe the busshement to-broke,

	 Many a tyme he layd hym downe,
	 And shot another whyle.

117A.343	&#145;I make myn auowe to God,&#146; sayde Robyn,
	 &#145;The sherif wolde I fayne see;
	 And if I may hym take,
	 I-quyte shall it be.&#146;
117A.344	And whan they came to Notingham,
	 They walked in the strete;
	 And with the proud  sherif i-wys
	 Son  can they mete.
117A.345	&#145;Abyde, thou proud  sherif,&#146; he sayde,
	 &#145;Abyde, and speke with me;
	 Of some tidinges of oure kinge
	 I wolde fayne here of the.
117A.346	&#145;This seuen yere, by dere worthy God,
	 Ne yede I this fast on fote;
	 I make myn auowe to God, thou proud  sherif,
	 It is nat for thy gode.&#146;
117A.347	Robyn bent a full goode bowe,
	 An arrowe he drowe at wyll;
	 He hit so the proud  sherife
	 Vpon the grounde he lay full still.
117A.348	And or he myght vp aryse,
	 On his fete to stonde,
	 He smote of the sherifs hede
	 With his bright[ ] bronde.
117A.349	&#145;Lye thou there, thou proud  sherife,
	 Euyll mote thou cheue!
	 There myght no man to the truste
	 The whyles thou were a lyue.&#146;
117A.350	His men drewe out theyr bryght swerdes,
	 That were so sharpe and kene,
	 And layde on the sheryues men,
	 And dryued them downe bydene.
117A.351	Robyn stert to that knyght,
	 And cut a two his bonde,
	 And toke hym in his hand a bowe,
	 And bad hym by hym stonde.
117A.352	&#145;Leue thy hors the behynde,
	 And lerne for to renne;
	 Thou shalt with me to gren  wode,
	 Through myr , mosse, and fenne.
117A.353	&#145;Thou shalt with me to gren  wode,
	 Without ony leasynge,
	 Tyll that I haue gete vs grace
	 Of Edwarde, our comly kynge.&#146;
117A.354	The kynge came to Notynghame,
	 With knyght s in grete araye,
	 For to take that gentyll knyght
	 And Robyn Hode, and yf he may.
117A.355	He asked men of that countr 
	 After Robyn Hode,
	 And after that gentyll knyght,
	 That was so bolde and stout.
117A.356	Whan they had tolde hym the case
	 Our kynge vnderstode ther tale,
	 And seased in his honde
	 The knyght s lond s all.
117A.357	All the passe of Lancasshyre
	 He went both ferre and nere,
	 Tyll he came to Plomton Parke;
	 He faylyd many of his dere.
117A.358	There our kynge was wont to se
	 Herd s many one,
	 He coud vnneth fynde one dere,
	 That bare ony good horne.
117A.359	The kynge was wonder wroth withall,
	 And swore by the Trynyt ,
	 &#145;I wolde I had Robyn Hode,
	 With eyen I myght hym se.
117A.360	&#145;And he that wolde smyte of the knyght s hede,
	 And brynge it to me,
	 He shall haue the knyght s londes,
	 Syr Rycharde at the Le.
117A.361	&#145;I gyue it hym with my charter,
	 And sele it [with] my honde,
	 To haue and holde for euer more,
	 In all mery Englonde.&#146;
117A.362	Than bespake a fayre olde knyght,
	 That was treue in his fay:
	 A, my leeg  lorde the kynge,
	 One worde I shall you say.
117A.363	There is no man in this countr 
	 May haue the knyght s londes,
	 Whyle Robyn Hode may ryde of gone,
	 And bere a bowe in his hondes,
117A.364	That he ne shall lese his hede,
	 That is the best ball in his hode:
	 Giue it no man, my lorde the kynge,
	 That ye wyll any good.
117A.365	Half a yere dwelled our comly kynge
	 In Notyngham, and well more;
	 Coude he not here of Robyn Hode,
	 In what countr  that he were.
117A.366	But alway went good Robyn
	 By halke and eke by hyll,
	 And alway slewe the kyng s dere,
	 And welt them at his wyll.
117A.367	Than bespake a proude fostere,
	 That stode by our kyng s kne;
	 Yf ye wyll se good Robyn,
	 Ye must do after me.
117A.368	Take fyue of the best knyght s

	 And walke downe by yon abbay,
	 And gete you monk s wede.
117A.369	And I wyll be your led s-man,
	 And lede you the way,
	 And or ye come to Notyngham,

117A.370	That ye shall mete with good Robyn,
	 On lyue yf that he be;
	 Or ye come to Notyngham,
	 With eyen ye shall hym se.
117A.371	Full hast[ ]ly our kynge was dyght,
	 So were his knyght s fyue,
	 Euerych of them in monk s wede,
	 And hasted them thyder blyve.
117A.372	Our kynge was grete aboue his cole,
	 A brode hat on his crowne,
	 Ryght as he were abbot-lyke,
	 They rode up in-to the towne.
117A.373	Styf bot s our kynge had on,
	 Forsoth as I you say;
	 He rode syngynge to gren  wode,
	 The couent was clothed in graye.
117A.374	His male-hors and his gret  somers
	 Folowed our kynge behynde,
	 Tyll they came to gren  wode,
	 A myle vnder the lynde.
117A.375	There they met with good Robyn,
	 Stondynge on the waye,

	 And gold full grete plent ;
	 Gyue vs some of your spendynge,
	 For saynt[ ] charyt .&#146;
117A.379	Than bespake our cumly kynge,
	 Anone than sayd he;
	 I brought no more to gren  wode
	 But forty pounde with me.
117A.380	I haue layne at Notyngham

	 And spent I haue full moche good,
	 On many a grete lordynge.
117A.381	And I haue but forty pounde,
	 No more than haue I me;
	 But yf I had an hondred pounde,
	 I wolde vouch it safe on the.
117A.382	Robyn toke the forty pounde,
	 And departed it in two partye;
	 Halfendell he gaue his mery men,
	 And bad them mery to be.
117A.383	Full curteysly Robyn gan say;

	 And sone he lete hym se;
	 Robyn coud his courteysy,
	 And set hym on his kne.
117A.386	&#145;I loue no man in all the worlde
	 So well as I do my kynge;
	 Welcome is my lord s seale;
	 And, monke, for thy tydynge,
117A.387	&#145;Syr abbot, for thy tydynges,
	 To day thou shalt dyne with me,
	 For the loue of my kynge,
	 Under my trystell-tre.&#146;
117A.388	Forth he lad our comly kynge,
	 Full fayre by the honde;
	 Many a dere there was slayne,
	 And full fast dyghtande.
117A.389	Robyn toke a full grete horne,
	 And loude he gan blowe;
	 Seuen score of wyght yonge men
	 Came redy on a rowe.
117A.390	All they kneled on theyr kne,
	 Full fayre before Robyn:
	 The kynge sayd hym selfe vntyll,
	 And swore by Saynt Austyn,
117A.391	&#145;Here is a wonder semely syght;
	 Me thynketh, by Godd s pyne,

	 Both Robyn and Lytell Johan.
117A.393	Anone before our kynge was set

	 The good whyte brede, the good rede wyne,
	 And therto the fyne ale and browne.
117A.394	&#145;Make good chere,&#146; said Robyn,
	 &#145;Abbot, for charyt ;
	 And for this ylk  tydynge,
	 Blyssed mote thou be.

	 Or thou hens wende;
	 Than thou may enfourme our kynge,
	 Whan ye togyder lende.&#146;
117A.396	Up they stert  all in hast,
	 Theyr bow s were smartly bent;
	 Our kynge was neuer so sore agast,
	 He wende to haue be shente.
117A.397	Two yerd s there were vp set,
	 Thereto gan they gange;
	 By fyfty pase, our kynge sayd,
	 The merk s were to longe.
117A.398	On euery syde a rose-garlonde,
	 They shot vnder the lyne:
	 &#145;Who so fayleth of the rose-garlonde,&#146; sayd Robyn,
	 &#145;His takyll he shall tyne,
117A.399	&#145;And yelde it to his mayster,
	 Be it neuer so fyne;
	 For no man wyll I spare,
	 So drynke I ale or wyne:
117A.400	&#145;And bere a buffet on his hede,
	 I-wys ryght all bare:&#146;
	 And all that fell in Robyns lote,
	 He smote them wonder sare.
117A.401	Twyse Robyn shot aboute,
	 And euer he cleued the wande,
	 And so dyde good Gylberte
	 With the Whyt  Hande.
117A.402	Lytell Johan and good Scathelocke,
	 For nothynge wolde they spare;
	 When they fayled of the garlonde,
	 Robyn smote them full sore.
117A.403	At the last shot that Robyn shot,
	 For all his frend s fare,
	 Yet he fayled of the garlonde
	 Thre fyngers and mare.
117A.404	Than bespake good Gylberte,
	 And thus he gan say;
	 &#145;Mayster,&#146; he sayd, &#146;your takyll is lost,
	 Stande forth and take your pay.&#146;
117A.405	&#145;If it be so,&#146; sayd Robyn,
	 &#145;That may no better be,
	 Syr abbot, I delyuer the myn arowe,
	 I pray the, syr, serue thou me.&#146;
117A.406	&#145;It falleth not for myn ordre,&#146; sayd our kynge,

	 For to smyte no good yeman,
	 For doute I sholde hym greue.&#146;
117A.407	&#145;Smyte on boldely,&#146; sayd Robyn,

	 To grounde he yede full nere:

	 &#145;Thou arte a stalworthe frere.
117A.409	&#145;There is pith in thyn arme,&#146; sayd Robyn,
	 &#145;I trowe thou canst well shete:&#146;
	 Thus our kynge and Robyn Hode
	 Togeder gan they mete.
117A.410	Robyn beheld our comly kynge
	 Wystly in the face,
	 So dyde Syr Rycharde at the Le,
	 And kneled downe in that place.
117A.411	And so dyde all the wylde outlawes,
	 Whan they se them knele:
	 &#145;My lorde the kynge of Englonde,
	 Now I knowe you well.

	 I ask  mersy, my lorde the kynge,
	 And for my men I craue.&#146;

	 With that thou leue the gren  wode,
	 And all thy company;
117A.415	&#145;And come home, syr, to my courte,
	 And there dwell with me.&#146;

	 &#145;And ryght so shall it be.
117A.416	&#145;I wyll come to your courte,

	 I [wyll] come agayne full soone,
	 And shote at the donn  dere,

	 To me and my meyn .&#146;

	 &#145;Or elles I were a fole;
	 Another day ye wyll me clothe,
	 I trowe, ayenst the Yole.&#146;
117A.421	The kynge kest of his col  then,
	 A grene garment he dyde on,
	 And euery knyght also, i-wys,
	 Another had full sone.
117A.422	Whan they were clothed in Lyncolne grene,

	 Shotynge all in-fere,
	 Towarde the towne of Notyngham,
	 Outlawes as they were.
117A.424	Our kynge and Robyn rode togyder,
	 For soth as I you say,
	 And they shote plucke-buffet,
	 As they went by the way.
117A.425	And many a buffet our kynge wan

	 &#145;Thy game is nought to lere;
	 I sholde not get a shote of the,
	 Though I shote all this yere.&#146;

	 They stode and behelde;
	 They sawe nothynge but mantels of grene
	 That couered all the felde.
117A.428	Than euery man to other gan say,
	 I drede our kynge be slone;
	 Com  Robyn Hode to the towne, i-wys
	 On lyue he lefte neuer one.&#146;
117A.429	Full hast[ ]ly they began to fle,

	 And olde wyues that myght euyll goo,
	 They hypped on theyr staues.
117A.430	The kynge l[o]ughe full fast,
	 And commaunded them agayne;
	 When they se our comly kynge,
	 I-wys they were full fayne.
117A.431	They ete and dranke, and made them glad,
	 And sange with not s hye;
	 Than bespake our comly kynge

117A.432	He gaue hym there his londe agayne,
	 A good man he bad hym be;
	 Robyn thanked our comly kynge,
	 And set hym on his kne.
117A.433	Had robyn dwelled in the kyng s courte
	 But twelue monethes and thre,

117A.434	In euery place where Robyn came

	 To gete hym grete renowne.
117A.435	By than the yere was all agone

	 Lytell Johan and good Scathlocke,
	 With hym all for to gone.
117A.436	Robyn sawe yonge men shote
	 Full fayre vpon a day;
	 &#145;Alas!&#146; than sayd good Robyn,
	 &#145;My welthe is went away.
117A.437	&#145;Somtyme I was an archere good,
	 A styffe and eke a stronge;
	 I was compted the best archere
	 That was in mery Englonde.

	 Tyll he came to our kynge:

	 Graunte me myn askynge.
117A.440	&#145;I made a chapell in Bernysdale,
	 That semely is to se,
	 It is of Mary Magdaleyne,
	 And thereto wolde I be.
117A.441	&#145;I myght neuer in this seuen nyght
	 No tyme to slepe ne wynke,
	 Nother all these seuen dayes
	 Nother ete ne drynke.

	 That all the outlawes of that forest
	 That horne coud they knowe,
117A.448	And gadred them togyder,
	 In a lytell throwe.
	 Seuen score of wyght yonge men

	 And set them on theyr kne:
	 &#145;Welcome,&#146; they sayd, &#146;our [der ] mayster,
	 Under this gren -wode tre.
117A.450	Robyn dwelled in gren  wode
	 Twenty yere and two;
	 For all drede of Edwarde our kynge,
	 Agayne wolde he not goo.
117A.451	Yet he was begyled, i-wys,
	 Through a wycked woman,
	 The pryoresse of Kyrk sly,

117A.453	They toke togyder theyr counsell
	 Robyn Hode for to sle,
	 And how they myght best do that dede,

	 In place where as he stode,
	 &#145;To morow I muste to Kyrke[s]ly,
	 Craftely to be leten blode.&#146;
117A.455	Syr Roger of Donkestere,
	 By the pryoresse he lay,
	 And there they betrayed good Robyn Hode,
	 Through theyr fals  playe.
117A.456	Cryst haue mercy on his soule,
	 That dyed on the rode!
	 For he was a good outlawe,
	 And dyde pore men moch god.
