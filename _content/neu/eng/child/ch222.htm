<PRE>

222A.1	 O BONNY Baby Livingston
	 Went forth to view the hay,
	 And by it came him Glenlion,
	 Sta bonny Baby away.
222A.2	 O first he&#146;s taen her silken coat,
	 And neest her satten gown,
	 Syne rowd her in a tartan plaid,
	 And hapd her round and rown.
222A.3	 He has set her upon his steed
	 And roundly rode away,
	 And neer loot her look back again
	 The live-long summer&#146;s day.
222A.4	 He&#146;s carried her oer hills and muirs
	 Till they came to a Highland glen,
	 And there he&#146;s met his brother John,
	 With twenty armed men.
222A.5	 O there were cows, and there were ewes,
	 And lasses milking there,
	 But Baby neer anse  lookd about,
	 Her heart was filld wi care.
222A.6	 Glenlion took her in his arms,
	 And kissd her, cheek and chin;
	 Says, I&#146;d gie a&#146; these cows and ewes
	 But ae kind look to win.
222A.7	 &#145;O ae kind look ye neer shall get,
	 Nor win a smile frae me,
	 Unless to me you&#146;ll favour shew,
	 And take me to Dundee.&#146;
222A.8	 &#145;Dundee, Baby?  Dundee, Baby?
	 Dundee you neer shall see
	 Till I&#146;ve carried you to Glenlion
	 And have my bride made thee.
222A.9	 &#145;We&#146;ll stay a while at Auchingour,
	 And get sweet milk and cheese,
	 And syne we&#146;ll gang to Glenlion,
	 And there live at our ease.&#146;
222A.10	 &#145;I winna stay at Auchingour,
	 Nor eat sweet milk and cheese,
	 Nor go with thee to Glenlion,
	 For there I&#146;ll neer find ease.&#146;
222A.11	 Than out it spake his brother John,
	 &#145;O were I in your place,
	 I&#146;d take that lady hame again,
	 For a&#146; her bonny face.
222A.12	 &#145;Commend me to the lass that&#146;s kind,
	 Tho na so gently born;
	 And, gin her heart I coudna gain,
	 To take her hand I&#146;d scorn.&#146;
222A.13	 &#145;O had your tongue now, John,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;You wis na what you say;
	 &#145;For I&#146;ve lood that bonny face
	 This twelve month and a day.
222A.14	 &#145;And tho I&#146;ve lood her lang and sair
	 A smile I neer coud win;
	 Yet what I&#146;ve got anse in my power
	 To keep I think nae sin.&#146;
222A.15	 When they came to Glenlion castle,
	 They lighted at the yate,
	 And out it came his sisters three,
	 Wha did them kindly greet.
222A.16	 O they&#146;ve taen Baby by the hands
	 And led her oer the green,
	 And ilka lady spake a word,
	 But bonny Baby spake nane.
222A.17	 Then out it spake her bonny Jean,
	 The youngest o the three,
	 &#145;O lady, dinna look sae sad,
	 But tell your grief to me.&#146;
222A.18	 &#145;O wherefore should I tell my grief,
	 Since lax I canna find?
	 I&#146;m stown frae a&#146; my kin and friends,
	 And my love I left behind.
222A.19	 &#145;But had I paper, pen, and ink,
	 Before that it were day,
	 I yet might get a letter sent
	 In time to Johny Hay.&#146;
222A.20	 O she&#146;s got paper, pen, and ink,
	 And candle that she might see,
	 And she has written a broad letter
	 To Johny at Dundee.
222A.21	 And she has gotten a bonny boy,
	 That was baith swift and strang,
	 Wi philabeg and bonnet blue,
	 Her errand for to gang.
222A.22	 &#145;O boy, gin ye&#146;d my blessing win
	 And help me in my need,
	 Run wi this letter to my love,
	 And bid him come wi speed.
222A.23	 &#145;And here&#146;s a chain of good red gowd,
	 And gowdn guineas three,
	 And when you&#146;ve well your errand done,
	 You&#146;ll get them for your fee.&#146;
222A.24	 The boy he ran oer hill and dale,
	 Fast as a bird coud flee,
	 And eer the sun was twa hours height
	 The boy was at Dundee.
222A.25	 And when he came to Johny&#146;s door
	 He knocked loud and sair;
	 Then Johny to the window came,
	 And loudly cry&#146;d, &#145;Wha&#146;s there?&#146;
222A.26	 &#145;O here&#146;s a letter I have brought,
	 Which ye maun quickly read,
	 And, gin ye woud your lady save,
	 Gang back wi me wi speed.&#146;
222A.27	 O when he had the letter read,
	 An angry man was he;
	 He says, Glenlion, thou shalt rue
	 This deed of villany!
222A.28	 &#145;O saddle to me the black, the black,
	 O saddle to me the brown,
	 O saddle to me the swiftest steed
	 That eer rade frae the town.
222A.29	 &#145;And arm ye well, my merry men a&#146;,
	 And follow me to the glen,
	 For I vow I&#146;ll neither eat nor sleep
	 Till I get my love again.&#146;
222A.30	 He&#146;s mounted on a milk-white steed,
	 The boy upon a gray,
	 And they got to Glenlion&#146;s castle
	 About the close of day.
222A.31	 As Baby at her window stood,
	 The west wind saft did bla;
	 She heard her Johny&#146;s well-kent voice,
	 Beneath the castle wa.
222A.32	 &#145;O Baby, haste, the window jump!
	 I&#146;ll kep you in my arm;
	 My merry men a&#146; are at the yate,
	 To rescue you frae harm.&#146;
222A.33	 She to the window fixt her sheets
	 And slipped safely down,
	 And Johny catchd her in his arms,
	 Neer loot her touch the ground.
222A.34	 When mounted on her Johny&#146;s horse,
	 Fou blithely did she say,
	 &#145;Glenlion, you hae lost your bride!
	 She&#146;s aff wi Johny Hay.&#146;
222A.35	 Glenlion and his brother John
	 Were birling in the ha,
	 When they heard Johny&#146;s bridle ring,
	 As first he rade awa.
222A.36	 &#145;Rise, Jock, gang out and meet the priest,
	 I hear his bridle ring;
	 My Baby now shall be my wife
	 Before the laverocks sing.&#146;
222A.37	 &#145;O brother, this is not the priest;
	 I fear he&#146;ll come oer late;
	 For armed men with shining brands
	 Stand at the castle-yate.&#146;
222A.38	 &#145;Haste Donald, Duncan, Dugald, Hugh!
	 Haste, take your sword and spier!
	 We&#146;ll gar these traytors rue the hour
	 That eer they ventured here.&#146;
222A.39	 The Highland men drew their claymores,
	 And gae a warlike shout,
	 But Johny&#146;s merry men kept the yate,
	 Nae ane durst venture out.
222A.40	 The lovers rade the live-lang night,
	 And safe gat on their way,
	 And bonny Baby Livingston
	 Has gotten Johny Hay.
222A.41	 &#145;Awa, Glenlion! fy for shame!
	 Gae hide ye in some den!
	 You&#146;ve lettn your bride be stown frae you,
	 For a&#146; your armed men.&#146;

222B.1	 BONNY Barbara Livingston
	 Went out to take the air,
	 When came the laird o Glenlyon
	 And staw the maiden fair.
222B.2	 He staw her in her cloak, her cloak,
	 He staw her in her gown;
	 Before he let her look again,
	 Was mony mile frae town.
222B.3	 So they rade over hills and dales,
	 Through m[o]ny a wilsome way,
	 Till they came to the head o yon hill,
	 And showed her ewes and kye.
222B.4	 &#145;O will ye stay with me, Barbara,
	 And get good curds and whey?
	 Or will ye go to Glenlyon,
	 And be a lady gay?&#146;
222B.5	 &#145;The Highlands is nae for me, kind sir,
	 The Highlands is nae for me,
	 But, gin ye woud my favour win,
	 Have me to bonny Dundee.&#146;

	 That town ye&#146;se never see;
	 I&#146;ll hae you to a finer place
	 Than eer was in Dundee.&#146;
222B.7	 But when she came to Glenlyon,
	 And lighted on the green,
	 Every lady spake Earse to her,
	 But Barbara could speak nane.
222B.8	 When they were all at dinner set,
	 And placed the table round,
	 Every one took some of it,
	 But Barbara took nane.
222B.9	 She put it to her cheek, her cheek,
	 She put it to her chin,
	 She put it to her rosey lips,
	 But neer a bit gaed in.
222B.10	 When day was gone, and night was come,
	 And a&#146; man bound for bed,
	 Glenlyon and that fair lady
	 To one chamber were laid.
222B.11	 &#145;O strip, O strip, my love,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;O strip and lay you down;&#146;
	 &#145;How can I strip?  How can I strip,
	 To bed wi an unco man?&#146;
222B.12	 He&#146;s taen out his little pen-knife,
	 And he slit down her gown,
	 And cut her stays behind her back,
	 And forc&#146;d her to lie down.
222B.13	 &#145;O day, dear sir!  O day, dear sir!
	 O dear! if it were day,
	 And me upon my father&#146;s steed,
	 I soon shoud ride away.&#146;
222B.14	 &#145;Your father&#146;s steed is in my stable,
	 Eating good corn and hay,
	 And ye are in my arms twa;
	 What needs you lang for day?&#146;
222B.15	 &#145;If I had paper, pens, and ink,
	 And light that I may see,
	 I woud write a broad, broad letter
	 To my love in Dundee.&#146;
222B.16	 They brought her paper, pen, and ink,
	 And light that she might see,
	 And she has written a broad letter
	 To her love in Dundee.
222B.17	 And aye she wrote, and aye she grat,
	 The saut tear blinded her ee;
	 And aye at every verse&#146;s end,
	 &#145;Haste, my bonny love, to me!&#146;
222B.18	 &#145;If I had but a little wee boy,
	 Would work for meat and fee,
	 Would go and carry this letter
	 To my love in Dundee!&#146;
222B.19	 &#145;O here am I, a little wee boy
	 Will work for meat and fee,
	 Will go and carry that letter
	 To your love in Dundee.&#146;
222B.20	 Upstarts the morn, the boy he ran
	 Oer mony a hill and dale,
	 And he wan on to bonny Dundee
	 About the hour o twall.
222B.21	 There geordy oer a window lay,
	 Beholding dale and down;
	 And he beheld a little wee boy
	 Come running to the town.
222B.22	 &#145;What news? what news, my little wee boy,
	 You run sae hastilie?&#146;
	 &#145;Your love is stown by Glenlyon,
	 And langs your face to see.&#146;
222B.23	 &#145;Gae saddle to me the black, the black,
	 Gae saddle to me the brown;
	 Gae saddle to me the swiftest steed
	 Will hae me to the town.
222B.24	 &#145;Get me my hat, dyed o the black,
	 My mourning-mantle tee,
	 And I will on to Glenlyon,
	 See my love ere she die.&#146;
222B.25	 First he tired the black, the black,
	 And then he tired the brown,
	 And next he tired the swiftest steed
	 Ere he wan to the town.
222B.26	 But for as fast as her love rade,
	 And as fast as he ran,
	 Before he wan to Glenlyon
	 His love was dead and gane.
222B.27	 Then he has kissd her cheek, her cheek,
	 And he has kissd her chin,
	 And he has kissd her comely mouth,
	 But no life was therein.
222B.28	 &#145;O wae mat worth you, Glenlyon,
	 An ill death mat ye die!
	 Ye&#146;ve twind me and the fairest flower
	 My eyes did ever see.
222B.29	 &#145;But I will kiss your cheek, Barbara,
	 And I will kiss your chin,
	 And I will kiss your comely mouth,
	 But neer woman&#146;s again.
222B.30	 &#145;Deal well, deal well at my love&#146;s lyke
	 The beer but and the wine,
	 For ere the morn at this same time
	 Ye&#146;ll deal the same at mine.&#146;
