<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">135A: Robin Hood and the Shepherd</H1>
<PRE>

135A.1	 ALL gentlemen and yeomen good,
	 Down a down a down a down
	 I wish you to draw near;
	 For a story of gallant brave Robin Hood
	 Vnto you I wil declare.
	 Down, etc.
135A.2	 As Robin Hood walkt the forrest along,
	 Some pastime for to spie,
	 There was he aware of a jolly shepherd,
	 That on the ground did lie.
135A.3	 &#145;Arise, arise,&#146; cryed jolly Robin,
	 &#145;And now come let me see
	 What is in thy bag and bottle, I say;
	 Come tell it unto me.&#146;
135A.4	 &#145;What&#146;s that to thee, thou proud fellow?
	 Tell me as I do stand
	 What thou hast to do with my bag and bottle?
	 Let me see thy command.&#146;
135A.5	 &#145;My sword, which hangeth by my side,
	 Is my command I know;
	 Come, and let me taste of thy bottle,
	 Or it may breed thee wo.&#146;
135A.6	 &#145;Tut, the devil a drop, thou proud fellow,
	 Of my bottle thou shalt see,
	 Untill thy valour here be tried,
	 Whether thou wilt fight or flee.&#146;
135A.7	 &#145;What shall we fight for?&#146; cries bold Robin Hood;
	 &#145;Come tell it soon to me;
	 Here is twenty pounds in good red gold;
	 Win it, and take it thee.&#146;
135A.8	 The Shepherd stood all in a maze,
	 And knew not what to say:
	 &#145;I have no money, thou proud fellow,
	 But bag and bottle I&#146;le lay.&#146;
135A.9	 &#145;I am content, thou shepherd-swain,
	 Fling them down on the ground;
	 But it will breed thee mickle pain,
	 To win my twenty pound.&#146;
135A.10	 &#145;Come draw thy sword, thou proud fellow,
	 Thou stands too long to prate;
	 This hook of mine shall let thee know
	 A coward I do hate.&#146;
135A.11	 So they fell to it, full hardy and sore;
	 It was in a summers day;
	 From ten till four in the afternoon
	 The Shepherd held him play.
135A.12	 Robins buckler proved his chief defence,
	 And saved him many a bang,
	 For every blow the Shepherd gave
	 Made Robins sword cry twang.
135A.13	 y a sturdy blow the Shepherd gave,
	 And that bold Robin found,
	 Till the blood ran trickling from his head;
	 Then he fell to the ground.
135A.14	 &#145;Arise, arise, thou proud fellow,
	 And thou shalt have fair play,
	 If thou wilt yield, before thou go,
	 That I have won the day.&#146;
135A.15	 &#145;A boon, a boon,&#146; cried bold Robin;
	 &#145;If that a man thou be,
	 Then let me take my beaugle-horn,
	 And blow but blasts three.&#146;
135A.16	 &#145;To blow three times three,&#146; the Shepherd said,
	 &#145;I will not thee deny;
	 For if thou shouldest blow till to-morrow morn,
	 I scorn one foot to fly.&#146;
135A.17	 Then Robin set his horn to his mouth,
	 And he blew with mickle main,
	 Until he espied Little John
	 Come tripping over the plain.
135A.18	 &#145;O who is yonder, thou proud fellow,
	 That comes down yonder hill?&#146;
	 &#145;Yonder is Little John, bold Robin Hoods man,
	 Shall fight with thee thy fill.&#146;
135A.19	 &#145;What is the matter?&#146; saies Little John,
	 &#145;Master, come tell to me:&#146;
	 &#145;My case is great,&#146; saies Robin Hood,
	 &#145;For the Shepherd hath conquered me.&#146;
135A.20	 &#145;I am glad of that,&#146; cries Little John,
	 &#145;Shepherd, turn thou to me;
	 For a bout with thee I mean to have,
	 Either come fight or flee.&#146;
135A.21	 &#145;With all my heart, thou proud fellow,
	 For it never shall be said
	 That a shepherds hook of thy sturdy look
	 Will one jot be dismaid.&#146;
135A.22	 So they fell to it, full hardy and sore,
	 Striving for victory;
	 &#145;I will know,&#146; saies John,  re we give ore,
	 Whether thou wilt fight or flye.&#146;
135A.23	 The Shepherd gave John a sturdy blow,
	 With his hook under the chin;
	 &#145;Beshrew thy heart,&#146; said Little John,
	 &#145;Thou basely dost begin.&#146;
135A.24	 &#145;Nay, that&#146;s nothing,&#146; said the Shepherd;
	 &#145;Either yield to me the day,
	 Or I will bang thee back and sides,
	 Before thou goest thy way.
135A.25	 &#145;What? dost thou think, thou proud fellow,
	 That thou canst conquer me?
	 Nay, thou shalt know, before thou go,
	 I&#146;le fight before I&#146;le flee.&#146;
135A.26	 With that to thrash Little John like mad
	 The Shepherd he begun;
	 &#145;Hold, hold,&#146; cryed bold Robin Hood,
	 &#145;And I&#146;le yield the wager won.&#146;
135A.27	 &#145;With all my heart,&#146; said Little John,
	 &#145;To that I will agree;
	 For he is the flower of shepherd-swains,
	 The like I never did see.&#146;
135A.28	 Thus have you heard of Robin Hood,
	 Also of Little John,
	 How a shepherd-swain did conquer them;
	 The like did never none.
