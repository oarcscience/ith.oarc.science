16[E].1	One king&#146;s daughter said to anither,
      Refrain:	Brume blumes bonnie and grows sae fair
16[E.1]	&#145;We&#146;ll gae ride like sister and brither.&#146;
      Refrain:	And we&#146;ll neer gae down to the brume nae mair
16[E.2]	&#145;We&#146;ll ride doun into yonder valley,
	Whare the greene green trees are budding sae gaily.
16[E.3]	&#145;Wi hawke and hounde we will hunt sae rarely,
	And we&#146;ll come back in the morning early.&#146;
16[E.4]	They rade on like sister and brither,
	And they hunted and hawket in the valley the-gether.
16[E.5]	&#145;Now, lady, hauld my horse and my hawk,
	For I maun na ride, and I downa walk.
16[E.6]	&#145;But set me doun be the rute o this tree,
	For there hae I dreamt that my bed sall be.&#146;
16[E.7]	The ae king&#146;s dochter did lift doun the ither,
	And she was licht in her armis like ony fether.
16[E.8]	Bonnie Lady Ann sat doun be the tree,
	And a wide grave was houkit whare nane suld be.
16[E.9]	The hawk had nae lure, and the horse had nae master,
	And the faithless hounds thro the woods ran faster.
16[E.10]	The one king&#146;s dochter has ridden awa,
	But bonnie Lady Ann lay in the deed-thraw.

16[F.1]	It becomes you and me to be very douce.&#146;

16[F.2]	&#145;Will you to to yon hill so hie,
	Take your bow and your arrow wi thee.&#146;
16[F.3]	He&#146;s tane his lady on his back,
	And his auld son in his coat-lap.
16[F.4]	&#145;When ye hear me give a cry,
	Ye&#146;ll shoot your bow and let me ly.
16[F.5]	&#145;When ye see me lying still,
	Throw awa your bow and come running me till.&#146;
16[F.6]	When he heard her gie a cry,
	He shot his bow and he let her lye.
16[F.7]	When he saw she was lying still,
	He threw awa his bow and came running her till.
16[F.8]	It was nae wonder his heart was sad,
	When he shot his auld son at her head.

	He buried his auld son down by her side.
16[F.10]	It was nae wonder his heart was sair,

	Neer&#146;ll bring such a sheathe and knife to me.

	Will neer bring such a sheath and knife to my hand.&#146;
