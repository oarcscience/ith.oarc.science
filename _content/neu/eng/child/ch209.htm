209A.6	 And first appeard the fatal block,
	 And syne the aix to head him,
	 And Geordie cumin down the stair,
	 And bands o airn upon him.
209A.7	 But tho he was chaind in fetters strang,
	 O airn and steel sae heavy,
	 There was na ane in a&#146; the court
	 Sae bra a man as Geordie.
209A.8	 O she&#146;s down on her bended knee,
	 I wat she&#146;s pale and weary:
	 &#145;O pardon, pardon, noble king,
	 And gie me back my dearie!
209A.9	 &#145;I hae born seven sons to my Geordie dear,

209A.11	 The Gordons cam, and the Gordons ran,
	 And they were stark and steady,
	 And ay the word amang them a&#146;

	 And he kist her lips sae rosy:
	 &#145;The fairest flower o woman-kind
	 Is my sweet, bonie lady!&#146;

	 And swimd at the Queen&#146;s Ferry.
209C.6	 And when she came to the prison-door,
	 There poor folks they stood many;
	 She dealt the red guineas them among,
	 And bade them pray weel for Geordie.

	 But she telld the red guineas many,
	 Till they&#146;ve telld down ten hundred crowns,
	 And away she&#146;s got her Geordie.
209C.12	 [It&#146;s up then spoke an Irish lord,
	 And O but he spoke bauldly!]

209H.10	 When she cam on to Edinboro town,

209H.11	 When she gaed up the tolbooth-stair,

209I.1	 &#145;I choosed my love at the bonny yates of Gight,

209I.13	 &#145;He hasna brunt, he hasna slain,

209I.14	 In it comes First Lord Judge,

	 &#145;Is there not a lord among you all
	 Can plead a word for Geordy?&#146;

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">209J: Geordie</H3>
<PRE>

209J.1	 &#145;FIRST I was lady o Black Riggs,
	 And then into Kincraigie;
	 Now I am the Lady o Gight,
	 And my love he&#146;s ca&#146;d Geordie.
209J.2	 &#145;I was the mistress o Pitfan,
	 And madam o Kincraigie;
	 But now my name is Lady Anne,
	 And I am Gight&#146;s own lady.
209J.3	 &#145;We courted in the woods o Gight,
	 Where birks and flowrs spring bonny;
	 But pleasures I had never one,
	 But sorrows thick and mony.
209J.4	 &#145;He never ownd me as his wife,
	 Nor honourd me as his lady,
	 But day by day he saddles the grey,
	 And rides to Bignet&#146;s lady.&#146;
209J.5	 When Bignet he got word of that,
	 That Gight lay wi his lady,
	 He&#146;s casten him in prison strong,
	 To ly till lords were ready.
209J.6	 &#145;Where will I get a little wee boy,
	 That is baith true and steady,
	 That will run on to bonny Gight,
	 And bring to me my lady?&#146;
209J.7	 &#145;O here am I, a little wee boy,
	 That is baith true and steady,
	 That will run to the yates of Gight,
	 And bring to you your lady.&#146;
209J.8	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll bid her saddle the grey, the grey,
	 The brown rode neer so smartly;
	 Ye&#146;ll bid her come to Edinbro town,
	 A&#146; for the life of Geordie.&#146;
209J.9	 The night was fair, the moon was clear,
	 And he rode by Bevany,
	 And stopped at the yates o Gight,
	 Where leaves were thick and mony.
209J.10	 The lady lookd oer castle-wa,
	 And dear, but she was sorry!
	 &#145;Here comes a page frae Edinbro town;
	 A&#146; is nae well wi Geordie.
209J.11	 &#145;What news, what news, my little boy?
	 Come tell me soon and shortly;&#146;
	 &#145;Bad news, bad news, my lady,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;They&#146;re going to hang your Geordie.&#146;
209J.12	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll saddle to me the grey, the grey,
	 The brown rade neer so smartly;
	 And I&#146;ll awa to Edinbro town,
	 Borrow the life o Geordie.&#146;
209J.13	 When she came near to Edinbro town,
	 I wyte she didna tarry,
	 But she has mounted her grey steed,
	 And ridden the Queen&#146;s Ferry.
209J.14	 When she came to the boat of Leith,
	 I wat she didna tarry;
	 She gae the boatman a guinea o gowd
	 To boat her ower the ferry.
209J.15	 When she came to the pier o Leith,
	 The poor they were sae many;
	 She dealt the gowd right liberallie,
	 And bade them pray for Geordie.
209J.16	 When she gaed up the tolbooth-stair,
	 The nobles there were many:
	 And ilka ane stood hat on head,
	 But hat in hand stood Geordie.
209J.17	 She gae a blink out-ower them a&#146;,
	 And three blinks to her Geordie;
	 But when she saw his een fast bound,
	 A swoon fell in this lady.
209J.18	 &#145;Whom has he robbd? What has he stole?
	 Or has he killed ony?
	 Or what&#146;s the crime that he has done,
	 His foes they are sae mony?&#146;
209J.19	 &#145;He hasna brunt, he hasna slain,
	 He hasna robbed ony;
	 But he has done another crime,
	 For which he will pay dearly.&#146;
209J.20	 Then out it speaks Lord Montague,
	 O wae be to his body!
	 &#145;The day we hangd young Charles Hay,
	 The morn we&#146;ll head your Geordie.&#146;
209J.21	 Then out it speaks the king himsell,
	 Vow, but he spake bonny!
	 &#145;Come here, young Gight, confess your sins,
	 Let&#146;s hear if they be mony.
209J.22	 &#145;Come here, young Gight, confess your sins,
	 See ye be true and steady;
	 And if your sins they be but sma,
	 Then ye&#146;se win wi your lady.&#146;
209J.23	 &#145;Nane have I robbd, nought have I stown,
	 Nor have I killed ony;
	 But ane of the king&#146;s best brave steeds,
	 I sold him in Bevany.&#146;
209J.24	 Then out it speaks the king again,
	 Dear, but he spake bonny!
	 &#145;That crime&#146;s nae great; for your lady&#146;s sake,
	 Put on your hat now, Geordie.&#146;
209J.25	 Then out it speaks Lord Montague,
	 O wae be to his body!
	 &#145;There&#146;s guilt appears in Gight&#146;s ain face,
	 Ye&#146;ll cross-examine Geordie.&#146;
209J.26	 &#145;Now since it all I must confess,
	 My crimes&#146; baith great and mony:
	 A woman abused, five orphan babes,
	 I killd them for their money.&#146;
209J.27	 Out it speaks the king again,
	 And dear, but he was sorry!
	 &#145;Your confession brings confusion,
	 Take aff your hat now, Geordie.&#146;
209J.28	 Then out it speaks the lady hersell,
	 Vow, but she was sorry!
	 &#145;Now all my life I&#146;ll wear the black,
	 Mourn for the death o Geordie.&#146;
209J.29	 Lord Huntly then he did speak out,
	 O fair mot fa his body!
	 &#145;I there will fight doublet alane
	 Or ony thing ails Geordie.&#146;
209J.30	 Then out it speaks the king again,
	 Vow, but he spake bonny!
	 &#145;If ye&#146;ll tell down ten thousand crowns,
	 Ye&#146;ll buy the life o Geordie.&#146;
209J.31	 She spread her mantle on the ground,
	 Dear, but she spread it bonny!
	 Some gae her crowns, some ducadoons,
	 And some gae dollars mony:
	 Then she tauld down ten thousand crowns,
	 &#145;Put on your hat, my Geordie.&#146;
209J.32	 Then out it speaks Lord Montague,
	 Wae be to his body!
	 &#145;I wisht that Gight wanted the head;
	 I might enjoyd his lady.&#146;
209J.33	 Out it speaks the lady hersell,
	 &#145;Ye need neer wish my body;
	 O ill befa your wizzend snout!
	 Woud ye compare wi Geordie?&#146;
209J.34	 When she was in her saddle set,
	 Riding the leys sae bonny,
	 The fiddle and fleet playd neer sae sweet
	 As she behind her Geordie.
209J.35	 &#145;O Geordie, Geordie, I love you well,
	 Nae jealousie coud move me;
	 The birds in air, that fly in pairs,
	 Can witness how I love you.
209J.36	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll call for one, the best o clerks,
	 Ye&#146;ll call him soon amd shortly,
	 As he may write what I indite,
	 A&#146; this I&#146;ve done for Geordie.&#146;
209J.37	 He turned him right and round about,
	 And high, high looked Geordie:
	 &#145;A finger o Bignet&#146;s lady&#146;s hand
	 Is worth a&#146; your fair body.&#146;
209J.38	 &#145;My lands may a&#146; be masterless,
	 My babes may want their mother;
	 But I&#146;ve made a vow, will keep it true,
	 I&#146;ll be bound to no other.&#146;
209J.39	 These words they causd a great dispute,
	 And proud and fierce grew Geordie;
	 A sharp dagger he pulled out,
	 And pierced the heart o &#146;s lady.
209J.40	 The lady&#146;s dead, and Gight he&#146;s fled,
	 And left his lands behind him;
	 Altho they searched south and north,
	 There were nane there coud find him.
209J.41	 Now a&#146; that lived into Black Riggs,
	 And likewise in Kincraigie,
	 For seven years were clad in black,
	 To mourn for Gight&#146;s own lady.
