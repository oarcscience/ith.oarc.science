<PRE>

38A.1	As I was walking all alone,
	Between a water and a wa,
	And there I spy&#146;d a wee wee man,
	And he was the least that ere I saw.
38A.2	His legs were scarce a shathmont&#146;s length,
	And thick and thimber was his thigh;
	Between his brows there was a span,
	And between his shoulders there was three.
38A.3	He took up a meikle stane,
	And he flang&#146;t as far as I could see;
	Though I had been a Wallace wight,
	I couldna liften&#146;t to my knee.
38A.4	&#145;O wee wee man, but thou be strang!
	O tell me where thy dwelling be?&#146;
	&#145;My dwelling&#146;s down at yon bonny bower;
	O will you go with me and see?&#146;
38A.5	On we lap, and awa we rade,
	Till we came to yon bonny green;
	We lighted down for to bait our horse,
	And out there came a lady fine.
38A.6	Four and twenty at her back,
	And they were a&#146; clad out in green;
	Though the King of Scotland had been there,
	The warst o them might hae been his queen.
38A.7	On we lap, and awa we rade,
	Till we came to yon bonny ha,
	Whare the roof was o the beaten gould,
	And the floor was o the cristal a&#146;.
38A.8	When we came to the stair-foot,
	Ladies were dancing, jimp and sma,
	But in the twinkling of an eye,
	My wee wee man was clean awa.

	Atween a water and a wa,

38C.1	&#146;TWAS down by Carterhaugh, father,

	As far as I could see;

38D.1	AS I gaed out to tak a walk,
	Atween the water and the wa,
	There I met wi a wee wee man,
	The weest man that ere I saw.
38D.2	Thick and short was his legs,
	And sma and thin was his thie,
	And atween his een a flee might gae,
	And atween his shouthers were inches three.
38D.3	And he has tane up a muckle stane,
	And thrown it farther than I coud see;
	If I had been as strong as ere Wallace was,
	I coud na lift it to my knie.
38D.4	&#145;O,&#146; quo I, &#146;But ye be strong!
	And O where may your dwelling be?&#146;
	&#145;It&#146;s down in to yon bonnie glen;
	Gin ye dinna believe, ye can come and see.&#146;
38D.5	And we rade on, and we sped on,

38E.2	His leg was scarse a shaftmont lang,
	Both thick and nimble was his knee;
	Between his eyes there was a span,
	Betwixt his shoulders were ells three.
38E.3	This wee wee man pulled up a stone,

	Tho I had been like Wallace strong,
	I wadna gotn&#146;t up to my knee.
38E.4	I said, Wee man, oh, but you&#146;re strong!
	Where is your dwelling, or where may&#146;t be?

38F.1	AS I was walking mine alane,
	Between the water and the wa,
	And oh there I spy&#146;d a wee wee mannie,
	The weeest mannie that ere I saw.
38F.2	His legs they were na a gude inch lang,
	And thick and nimble was his thie;
	Between his een there was a span,
	And between his shouthers there were ells three.
38F.3	I asked at this wee wee mannie
	Whare his dwelling place might be;
	The answer that he gied to me
	Was, Cum alang, and ye shall see.
38F.4	So we&#146;ll awa, and on we rade,
	Till we cam to yon bonnie green;
	We lichted down to bait our horse,
	And up and started a lady syne.

38G.1	AS I gaed out to tak the air,
	Between Midmar and bonny Craigha,
	There I met a little wee man,
	The less o him I never saw.
38G.2	His legs were but a finger lang,
	And thick and nimle was his knee;
	Between his brows there was a span,
	Between his shoulders ells three.
38G.3	He lifted a stane sax feet in hight,
	He lifted it up till his right knee,
	And fifty yards and mair, I&#146;m sure,
	I wyte he made the stane to flee.
38G.4	&#145;O little wee man, but ye be wight!
	Tell me whar your dwelling be;&#146;
	&#145;I hae a bower, compactly built,
	Madam, gin ye&#146;ll cum and see.&#146;
38G.5	Sae on we lap, and awa we rade,
	Till we come to yon little ha;
	The kipples ware o the gude red gowd,
	The reef was o the proseyla.
38G.6	Pipers were playing, ladies dancing,
	The ladies dancing, jimp and sma;
	At ilka turning o the spring,
	The little man was wearin&#146;s wa.
38G.7	Out gat the lights, on cam the mist,
	Ladies nor mannie mair coud see
	I turnd about, and gae a look,
	Just at the foot o&#146; Benachie.
