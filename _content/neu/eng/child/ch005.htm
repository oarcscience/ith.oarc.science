	That I suld leave my mother good.

5C.1	WE were sisters, we were seven,
	We were the fairest under heaven.
5C.2	And it was a&#146; our seven years wark
	To sew our father&#146;s seven sarks.
5C.3	And whan our seven years wark was done,
	We laid it out upo the green.
5C.4	We coost the lotties us amang,
	Wha wad to the greenwood gang.
5C.5	To pu the lily but and the rose,
	To strew witha&#146; our sisters&#146; bowers.
5C.6	. . . . . I was youngest,
	. . . . . my weer was hardest.
5C.7	And to the greenwood I bud gae,
	. . . . .
5C.8	There I met a handsome childe,
	. . . . .
5C.9	High-coled stockings and laigh-coled shoon,
	He bore him like a king&#146;s son.
5C.10	An was I weel, or was I wae,
	He keepit me a&#146; the simmer day.
5C.11	An though I for my hame-gaun sich[t],
	He keepit me a&#146; the simmer night.
5C.12	He gae to me a gay gold ring,
	And bade me keep it aboon a&#146; thing.
5C.13	He gae to me a cuttie knife,
	And bade me keep it as my life:
5C.14	Three lauchters o his yellow hair,
	For fear we wad neer meet mair.
	* * * * *
5C.15	Next there came shippes three,
	To carry a&#146; my bridal fee.
5C.16	Gowd were the beaks, the sails were silk,
	Wrought wi maids&#146; hands like milk.
5C.17	They came toom and light to me,
	But heavie went they waie frae me.
5C.18	y were fu o baken bread,
	They were fu of wine sae red.
5C.19	My dowry went a&#146; by the sea,
	But I gaed by the grenewode tree.
5C.20	An I sighed and made great mane,
	As thro the grenewode we rade our lane.
5C.21	An I ay siched an wiped my ee,
	That eer the grenewode I did see.
5C.22	&#145;Is there water in your glove,
	Or win into your shoe?
	O[r] am I oer low a foot-page
	To rin by you, ladie?&#146;
5C.23	&#145;O there&#146;s nae water in my glove,
	Nor win into my shoe;
	But I am maning for my mither
	Wha&#146;s far awa frae me.&#146;
	* * * * *
5C.24	&#145;Gin ye be a maiden fair,
	Meikle gude ye will get there.
5C.25	&#145;If ye be a maiden but,
	Meikle sorrow will ye get.
5C.26	&#145;For seven king&#146;s daughters he hath wedded,
	But never wi ane o them has bedded.
5C.27	&#145;He cuts the breasts frae their breast-bane,
	An sends them back unto their dame.
5C.28	&#145;He sets their backs unto the saddle,
	An sends them back unto their father.
5C.29	&#145;But be ye maiden or be ye nane,
	To the gowden chair ye draw right soon.
5C.30	&#145;But be ye leman or be ye maiden,
	Sit nae down till ye be bidden.&#146;
5C.31	Was she maiden or was she nane,
	To the gowden chair she drew right soon.
5C.32	she leman or was she maiden,
	She sat down ere she was bidden.
5C.33	Out then spake the lord&#146;s mother;
	Says, &#145;This is not a maiden fair.
5C.34	&#145;In that chair nae leal maiden
	Eer sits down till they be bidden.&#146;
5C.35	The Billie Blin then outspake he,
	As he stood by the fair ladie.
5C.36	&#145;The bonnie may is tired wi riding,
	Gaurd her sit down ere she was bidden.&#146;
	* * * * *
5C.37	But on her waiting-maid she ca&#146;d:
	&#145;Fair ladie, what&#146;s your will wi me?&#146;
	&#145;O ye maun gie yere maidenheid
	This night to an unco lord for me.&#146;
5C.38	&#145;I hae been east, I hae been west,
	I hae been far beyond the sea,
	But ay, by grenewode or by bower,
	I hae keepit my virginitie.
5C.39	&#145;But will it for my ladie plead,
	I&#146;ll gie&#146;t this night to an unco lord.&#146;
	* * * * *
5C.40	When bells were rung an vespers sung,
	An men in sleep were locked soun,
5C.41	Childe Branton and the waiting-maid
	Into the bridal bed were laid.
5C.42	&#145;O lie thee down, my fair ladie,
	Here are a&#146; things meet for thee;
5C.43	&#145;Here&#146;s a bolster for yere head,
	Here is sheets an comelie weids.&#146;
	* * * * *
5C.44	&#145;Now tell to me, ye Billie Blin,
	If this fair dame be a leal maiden.&#146;
5C.45	&#145;I wat she is as leal a wight
	As the moon shines on in a simmer night.
5C.46	&#145;I wat she is as leal a may
	As the sun shines on in a simmer day.
5C.47	&#145;But your bonnie bride&#146;s in her bower,
	Dreeing the mither&#146;s trying hour.&#146;
5C.48	Then out o his bridal bed he sprang,
	An into his mither&#146;s bower he ran.
5C.49	&#145;O mither kind, O mither dear,
	This is nae a maiden fair.
5C.50	&#145;The maiden I took to my bride
	Has a bairn atween her sides.
5C.51	&#145;The maiden I took to my bower
	Is dreeing the mither&#146;s trying hour.&#146;
5C.52	Then to the chamber his mother flew,
	And to the wa the door she threw.
5C.53	She stapt at neither bolt nor ban,
	Till to that ladie&#146;s bed she wan.
5C.54	Says, &#145;Ladie fair, sae meek an mild,
	Wha is the father o yere child?&#146;
5C.55	&#145;O mither dear,&#146; said that ladie,
	&#145;I canna tell gif I sud die.
5C.56	&#145;We were sisters, we were seven,
	We were the fairest under heaven.
5C.57	&#145;And it was a&#146; our seven years wark
	To sew our father&#146;s seven sarks.
5C.58	&#145;And whan our seven years wark was done,
	We laid it out upon the green.
5C.59	&#145;We coost the lotties us amang,
	Wha wad to the greenwode gang;

5C.62	&#145;And to the greenwode I bu[d] gae.

5C.64	&#145;Wi laigh-coled stockings and high-coled shoon,
	He seemed to be some king&#146;s son.
5C.65	&#145;And was I weel or was I wae,
	He keepit me a&#146; the simmer day.
5C.66	&#145;Though for my hame-gaun I oft sicht,
	He keepit me a&#146; the simmer night.
5C.67	&#145;He gae to me a gay gold ring,
	An bade me keep it aboon a&#146; thing;
5C.68	&#145;Three lauchters o he yellow hair,
	For fear that we suld neer meet mair.
5C.69	&#145;O mither, if ye&#146;ll believe nae me,

5C.70	An ay she coost, an ay she flang,
	Till her ain gowd ring came in her hand.
5C.71	And scarce aught i the coffer she left,
	Till she gat the knife wi the siller heft,
5C.72	Three lauchters o his yellow hair,
	Knotted wi ribbons dink and rare.
5C.73	She cried to her son, &#145;Where is the ring
	Your father gave me at our wooing,
	An I gae you at your hunting?
5C.74	&#145;What did ye wi the cuttie knife,
	I bade ye keep it as yere life?&#146;
5C.75	&#145;O haud yere tongue, my mither dear;
	I gae them to a lady fair.

5C.79	&#145;Keep still yere lands, keep still yere towers;
	Ye hae that lady within your bowers.&#146;
5C.80	Then to his ladie fast ran he,
	An low he kneeled on his knee.
5C.81	&#145;O tauk ye up my son,&#146; said he,
	&#145;An, mither, tent my fair ladie.
5C.82	&#145;O wash him purely i the milk,
	And lay him saftly in the silk.
5C.83	&#145;An ye maun bed her very soft,
	For I maun kiss her wondrous oft.&#146;

5E.2	As he was walking late alone,

5E.3	He keeped her so long and long,
	From the evening late till the morning came.
5E.4	All that he gave her at their parting
	Was a pair of gloves and a gay gold ring.
5E.5	Lord Benwall he&#146;s a wooing gone,

5E.6	As he was walking the Haleigh throw,

5E.20	&#145;As I was walking once late alone,

5E.25	&#145;Lord Benwall, wilt thou tell to me
	Where is the ring I gave to thee?&#146;
5E.26	&#145;Now I would give all my lands and tower,
	To have that lady in my bower.
5E.27	&#145;I would give all my lands and rents,
	To have that lady in my tents.&#146;
5E.28	&#145;You need not give all your lands and tower,
	For you have that lady in your power.
5E.29	&#145;You need not give all your lands and rents,
	For you have that lady in your tents.&#146;
5E.30	Now it was written on the child&#146;s breast-bone
	Lord Benwall&#146;s sirname and his name.
5E.31	It was written on the child&#146;s right hand
	That he should be heir of Lord Benwall&#146;s land.

      Refrain:	Adown adown, and adown and adown
	The flower of a&#146; fair Scotland ower.
      Refrain:	Adown adown, and adown and adown
5H.2	We were sisters, sisters seven,
	The fairest women under heaven.
5H.3	There fell a dispute us amang,
	Wha would to the greenwood gang.
5H.4	They kiest the kevels them amang,
	O wha would to the greenwood gang.
5H.5	The kevels they gied thro the ha,
	And on the youngest it did fa.
5H.6	The kevel fell into her hand,
	To greenwood she was forced to gang.
5H.7	She hedna pued a flower but ane,
	When by there came an earl&#146;s son.
5H.8	&#145;And was he well or was he wae,
	He keepet me that summer&#146;s day.&#146;
5H.9	And was he weel or was he weight,
	He keepet her that summer&#146;s night.
5H.10	And he gave her a gay goud ring
	His mother got at her wedding.

5H.11	&#145;Oh is yer stirrup set too high?
	Or is your saddle set awry?
5H.12	&#145;Oh is yer stirrup set too side?
	Or what&#146;s the reason ye canna ride?&#146;
	* * * * *
5H.13	When all were at the table set,
	Then not a bit could this lady eat.
5H.14	When all made merry at the feast,
	This lady wished she were at her rest.
