235A.1	 THE Earl of Aboyne he&#146;s courteous and kind,
	 He&#146;s kind to every woman,
	 And the Earl of Aboyne he&#146;s courteous and kind,
	 But he stays ower lang in London.
235A.2	 The ladie she stood on her stair-head,
	 Beholding his grooms a coming;
	 She knew by their livery and raiment so rare
	 That their last voyage was from London.
235A.3	 &#145;My grooms all, ye&#146;ll be well in call,
	 Hold all the stables shining;
	 With a bretther o degs ye&#146;ll clear up my nags,
	 Sin my gude lord Aboyne is a coming.
235A.4	 &#145;My minstrels all, be well in call,
	 Hold all my galleries ringing;
	 With music springs ye&#146;ll try well your strings,
	 Sin my gude lord&#146;s a coming.
235A.5	 &#145;My cooks all, be well in call,
	 Wi pots and spits well ranked;
	 And nothing shall ye want that ye call for,
	 Sin my gude Lord Aboyne&#146;s a coming.
235A.6	 &#145;My chamber-maids, ye&#146;ll dress up my beds,
	 Hold all my rooms in shining;
	 With Dantzic waters ye&#146;ll sprinkle my walls,
	 Sin my good lord&#146;s a coming.&#146;
235A.7	 Her shoes was of the small cordain,
	 Her stockings silken twisting;
	 Cambrick so clear was the pretty lady&#146;s smock,
	 And her stays o the braided sattin.
235A.8	 Her coat was of the white sarsenent,
	 Set out wi silver quiltin,
	 And her gown was o the silk damask,
	 Set about wi red gold walting.
235A.9	 Her hair was like the threads of gold,
	 Wi the silk and sarsanet shining,
	 Wi her fingers sae white, and the gold rings sae grite,
	 To welcome her lord from London.
235A.10	 Sae stately she steppit down the stair,
	 And walkit to meet him coming;
	 Said, O ye&#146;r welcome, my bonny lord,
	 Ye&#146;r thrice welcome home from London!
235A.11	 &#145;If this be so that ye let me know,
	 Ye&#146;ll come kiss me for my coming,
	 For the morn should hae been my bonny wedding-day
	 Had I stayed the night in London.&#146;
235A.12	 Then she turned her about wi an angry look,
	 O for such a sorry woman!
	 &#145;If this be so that ye let me know,
	 Gang kiss your ladies in London.&#146;
235A.13	 Then he looked ower his left shoulder
	 To the worthie companie wi him;
	 Says he, Isna this an unworthy welcome
	 The we&#146;ve got, comin from London!
235A.14	 &#145;Get yer horse in call, my nobles all,
	 And I&#146;m sorry for yer coming,
	 But we&#146;ll horse, and awa to the bonny Bog o Gight,
	 And then we&#146;ll go on to London.&#146;
235A.15	 &#145;If this be Thomas, as they call you,
	 You&#146;ll see if he&#146;ll hae me with him;
	 And nothing shall he be troubled with me
	 But myself and my waiting-woman.&#146;
235A.16	 &#145;I&#146;ve asked it already, lady,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;And your humble servant, madam;
	 But one single mile he winna lat you ride
	 Wi his company and him to London.&#146;
235A.17	 A year and mare she lived in care,
	 And docters wi her dealin,
	 And with a crack her sweet heart brack,
	 And the letters is on to London.
235A.18	 When the letters he got, they were all sealed in black,
	 And he fell in a grievous weeping;
	 He said, She is dead whom I loved best
	 If I had but her heart in keepin.
235A.19	 Then fifteen o the finest lords
	 That London could afford him,
	 From their hose to their hat, they were all clad in black,
	 For the sake of her corpse, Margaret Irvine.
235A.20	 The furder he gaed, the sorer he wept,
	 Come keping her corpse, Margaret Irvine.
	 Until that he came to the yetts of Aboyne,
	 Where the corpse of his lady was lying.

	 An wo to the Marquess o Huntly,
	 Wha causd the Earl o Boyn prove sae very unkin
	 To a true an a beautiful lady!&#146;

235G.1	 THE Earl Aboyne to London has gane,
	 And all his nobles with him;
	 For a&#146; the braw ribbands he wore at his hat,
	 He has left his lady behind him.
235G.2	 She&#146;s called on her little foot-page,
	 And Jean, her gentlewoman;
	 Said, Fill to me a full pint of wine,
	 And I&#146;ll drink it at my lord&#146;s coming.
235G.3	 &#145;You&#146;re welcome, you&#146;re welcome, you&#146;re welcome,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;You&#146;re welcome home from London!&#146;
	 &#145;If I be as welcome as you now say,
	 Come kiss me, my bonnie Peggy Irvine.
235G.4	 &#145;Come kiss me, come kiss me, my lady,&#146; he says,
	 &#145;Come kiss me for my coming,
	 For the morn should hae been my wedding-day,
	 Had I staid any longer in London.&#146;
235G.5	 She turned about with an angry look,
	 Said, Woe&#146;s me for your coming!
	 If the morn should hae been your wedding-day,
	 Go back to your whore in London.
235G.6	 He&#146;s called on his little foot-page,
	 Said, Saddle both sure and swiftly,
	 And I&#146;l away to the Bogs o the Gay,
	 And speak wi the Marquis o Huntly.
235G.7	 She has called on her little foot-page,
	 Said, See if he&#146;ll take me with him;
	 And he shall hae nae mair cumber o me
	 But myself and my servant-woman.
235G.8	 &#145;O London streets they are too strait,
	 They are not for a woman,
	 And it is too low to ride in coach wi me
	 With your humble servant-woman.&#146;
235G.9	 He had not been at the Bogs o the Gay,
	 Nor yet his horse was baited,
	 Till a boy with a letter came to his hand
	 That his lady was lying streekit.
235G.10	 &#145;O woe! O woe! O woe!&#146; he says,
	 &#145;O woe&#146;s me for my coming!
	 I had rather lost the Bogs o the Gay
	 Or I&#146;d lost my bonny Peggy Irvine.
235G.11	 &#145;O woe! O woe! O woe!&#146; he said,
	 &#145;O woe to the Marquis o Huntly,
	 Gard the Earl of Aboyne prove very unkind
	 To a good and a dutiful lady!&#146;

235H.2	 He had not been a night in town,
	 Nor a day into the city,

	 For all the braw ribbands he wore at his hat,
	 He has left his lady behind him.
235I.2	 She has to her high castle gane,
	 To see if she saw him coming;
	 And who did she spy but her own servant Jack,
	 Coming riding home again from London.
235I.3	 &#145;What news, what news, my own servant Jack?
	 What news have you got from London?&#146;
	 &#145;Good news, good news, my lady,&#146; he says,

235I.4	 She has to her kitchen-maid gane:

	 And they&#146;re all away to London.

235J.1	 THE Earl of Aboyne has up to London gone,
	 And all his nobles with him,
	 And three broad letters he sent into his love
	 He would wed another woman in London.
235J.2	 She has turned the honey month about,
	 To see if he was coming,
	 And lang three miles ere he came to the town
	 She heard his bridle ringing.
235J.3	 She&#146;s went down unto the close and she&#146;s taen him from his horse,
	 Says, Ye&#146;re welcome home from London!
	 &#145;If I be as welcome, dear Peggy, as you say,
	 Come kiss me for my coming.
235J.4	 &#145;Come kiss me, come kiss me, dear Peggy,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;Come kiss me for my coming,
	 For tomorrow should have been my wedding-day
	 Had I tarried any longer in London.&#146;
235J.5	 She has turned herself round about,
	 And she was an angry woman:
	 &#145;If tomorrow should have been your wedding-day,
	 You may kiss with your sweethearts in London.&#146;
235J.6	 &#145;Go saddle me my steed,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;Saddle and make him ready;
	 For I must away to the bonny Bog of Keith,
	 For to visit the Marquis of Huntley.&#146;
235J.7	 &#145;Go ask him, go ask, dear Thomas,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Go ask if he&#146;ll take me with him;&#146;
	 &#145;I&#146;ve asked him once, and I&#146;ll ask him no more,
	 For ye&#146;ll never ride a mile in his company.&#146;
235J.8	 &#145;Go make to me my bed,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Make it soft and narrow;
	 For since my true lover has slighted me so,
	 I will die for him ere morrow.&#146;
235J.9	 She has called her waiting-man,
	 And Jean her gentlewoman:
	 &#145;Go bring to me a glass of red wine,
	 For I&#146;m as sick as any woman.&#146;
235J.10	 The bed it was not made nor well laid down,
	 Nor yet the curtains drawn on,
	 Till stays and gown and all did burst,
	 And it&#146;s alace for bonny Peggy Irvine!
235J.11	 The Earl of Aboyne was not at the Bog of Keith,
	 Nor met wi the Marquis of Huntley,
	 Till three broad etters were sent after him
	 That his pretty Peggy Irvine had left him.
235J.12	 He gave such a rap on the table where he sat
	 It made all the room for to tremble:
	 &#145;I would rather I had lost all the rents of Aboyne
	 Than have lost my pretty Peggy Irvine.&#146;
