242A.1	 DAVID DRUMMONDRR&#146;rrS destinie,
	 Gude man o appearance o Cargill;
	 I wat his blude rins in the flude,
	 Sae sair against his parents&#146; will.
242A.2	 She was the lass o Balathy toun,
	 And he the butler o Stobhall,
	 And mony a time she wauked late
	 To bore the coble o Cargill.
242A.3	 His bed was made in Kercock ha,
	 Of gude clean sheets and of [the] hay;
	 He wudna rest ae nicht therein,
	 But on the prude waters he wud gae.
242A.4	 His bed was made in Balathy toun,
	 Of the clean sheets and of the strae;
	 But I wat it was far better made
	 Into the bottom o bonnie Tay.
242A.5	 She bored the coble in seven pairts,
	 I wat her heart might hae been fu sair;
	 For there she got the bonnie lad lost
	 Wi the curly locks and the yellow hair.
242A.6	 He put his foot into the boat,
	 He little thocht o ony ill;
	 But before that he was mid-waters,
	 The weary coble began to fill.
242A.7	 &#145;Woe be to the lass o Balathy toun,
	 I wat an ill death may she die!
	 For she bored the coble in seven pairts,
	 And let the waters perish me.
242A.8	 &#145;Oh, help, oh help, I can get nane,
	 Nae help o man can to me come!&#146;
	 This was about his dying words,
	 When he was choaked up to the chin.
242A.9	 &#145;Gae tell my father and my mother
	 It was naebody did me this ill;
	 I was a-going my ain errands,
	 Lost at the coble o bonnie Cargill.&#146;
242A.10	 She bored the boat in seven pairts,
	 I wat she bored it wi gude will;
	 And there they got the bonnie lad&#146;s corpse,
	 In the kirk-shot o bonnie Cargill.
242A.11	 Oh a&#146; the keys o bonnie Stobha
	 I wat they at his belt did hing;
	 But a&#146; the keys of bonnie Stobha
	 They now ly low into the stream.
242A.12	 A braver page into his age
	 Neer set a foot upon the plain;
	 His father to his mother said,
	 &#145;Oh, sae soon as we&#146;ve wanted him!
242A.13	 &#145;I wat they had mair luve than this
	 When they were young and at the scule;
	 But for his sake she wauked late,
	 And bored the coble o bonnie Cargill.&#146;
242A.14	 &#145;There&#146;s neer a clean sark gae on my back,
	 Nor yet a kame gae in my hair;
	 There&#146;s neither coal nor candle-licht
	 Shall shine in my bouir foe evir mair.
242A.15	 &#145;At kirk nor market I&#146;se neer be at,
	 Nor yet a blythe blink in my ee;
	 There&#146;s neer a ane shall say to anither,
	 That&#146;s the lassie gard the young man die.
242A.16	 &#145;Between the yates o bonnie Stobha
	 And the kirk-style o bonnie Cargill,
	 There is mony a man and mother&#146;s son
	 That was at my love&#146;s burial.&#146;
