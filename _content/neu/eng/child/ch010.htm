	And he had daughters one, two, three.
      Refrain:	I&#146;ll prove true to my love,
	If my love will prove true to me.
	* * * * *
10[Y.2]	He gave the eldest a gay gold ring,
	But he gave the younger a better thing.
10[Y.3]	He bought the younger a beaver hat;
	The eldest she thought much of that.
10[Y.4]	&#145;Oh sister, oh sister, let us go run,
	To see the ships come sailing along!&#146;
10[Y.5]	And when they got to the sea-side brim,
	The eldest pushed the younger in.
10[Y.6]	&#145;Oh sister, oh sister, lend me your hand,
	I&#146;ll make you heir of my house and land.&#146;
10[Y.7]	&#145;I&#146;ll neither lend you my hand nor my glove,
	Unless you grant me your true-love.&#146;
10[Y.8]	Then down she sunk and away she swam,
	Untill she came to the miller&#146;s mill-dam.
10[Y.9]	The miller&#146;s daughter sat at the mill-door,
	As fair as never was seen before.
10[Y.10]	&#145;Oh father, oh father, there swims a swan,
	Or else the body of a dead woman.&#146;
10[Y.11]	The miller he ran with his fishing hook,
	To pull the fair maid out o the brook.
10[Y.12]	&#145;Wee&#146;ll hang the miller upon the mill-gate,
	For drowning of my sister Kate.&#146;
