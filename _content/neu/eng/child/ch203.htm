203A.1	 Inverey cam doun Deeside, whistlin and playin,
	 He was at brave Braikley&#146;s yett ere it was dawin.
203A.2	 He rappit fu loudly and wi a great roar,
	 Cried, Cum doun, cum doun, Braikley, and open the door.
203A.3	 &#145;Are ye sleeping, Baronne, or are ye wakin?
	 Ther&#146;s sharpe swords at your yett, will gar your blood spin.
203A.4	 &#145;Open the yett, Braikley, and lat us within,
	 Till we on the green turf gar your bluid rin.&#146;
203A.5	 Out spak the brave baronne, owre the castell-wa:
	 &#145;Are ye cum to spulyie and plunder mi ha?
203A.6	 &#145;But gin ye be gentlemen, licht and cum in:
	 Gin ye drink o my wine, ye&#146;ll nae gar my bluid spin.
203A.7	 &#145;Gin ye be hir&#146;d widifus, ye may gang by,
	 Ye may gang to the lawlands and steal their fat ky.
203A.8	 &#145;Ther spulyie like rievers o wyld kettrin clan,
	 Who plunder unsparing baith houses and lan.
203A.9	 &#145;Gin ye be gentlemen, licht an cum [in],
	 Ther&#146;s meat an drink i my ha for every man.
203A.10	 &#145;Gin ye bir&#146;d widifus, ye may gang by,
	 Gang doun to the lawlands, and steal horse and ky.&#146;
203A.11	 Up spak his ladie, at his bak where she lay,
	 &#145;Get up, get up, Braikley, and be not afraid;
	 The&#146;r but young hir&#146;d widifus wi belted plaids.&#146;
203A.12	 &#145;Cum kiss me, mi Peggy, I&#146;le nae langer stay,
	 For I will go out and meet Inverey.
203A.13	 &#145;But haud your tongue, Peggy, and mak nae sic din,
	 For yon same hir&#146;d widifus will prove themselves men.&#146;
203A.14	 She called on her marys, they cam to her hand;
	 Cries, Bring me your rocks, lassies, we will them command.
203A.15	 &#145;Get up, get up, Braikley, and turn bak your ky,
	 Or me an mi women will them defy.
203A.16	 &#145;Cum forth then, mi maidens, and show them some play;
	 We&#146;ll ficht them, and shortly the cowards will fly.
203A.17	 &#145;Gin I had a husband, whereas I hae nane,
	 He woud nae ly i his bed and see his ky taen.
203A.18	 &#145;Ther&#146;s four-and-twenty milk-whit calv5s, tw1l o them ky,
	 In the woods o Glentanner, it&#146;s ther thei a&#146; ly.
203A.19	 &#145;Ther&#146;s goat i the Etnach, and sheep o the brae,
	 An a&#146; will be plunderd by young Inverey.&#146;
203A.20	 &#145;Now haud your tongue, Peggy, and gie me a gun,
	 Ye&#146;ll see me gae furth, but I&#146;ll never cum in.
203A.21	 &#145;Call mi brother William, mi unkl also,
	 Mi cousin James Gordon; we&#146;ll mount and we&#146;ll go.&#146;
203A.22	 When Braikley was ready and stood i the closs,
	 He was the bravest baronne that eer mounted horse.
203A.23	 Whan all wer assembld o the castell green,
	 No man like brave Braikley was ther to be seen
203A.24	 . . . . .
	 &#145;Turn bak, brother William, ye are a bridegroom;
203A.25	 &#145;Wi bonnie Jean Gordon, the maid o the mill;
	 O sichin and sobbin she&#146;ll soon get her fill.&#146;

	 I&#146;ll ficht i your quarral as lang&#146;s I can stand.
203A.27	 &#145;I&#146;ll ficht, my dear brother, wi heart and gude will,
	 And so will young Harry that lives at the mill.
203A.28	 &#145;But turn, mi dear brother, and nae langer stay:
	 What&#146;ll cum o your ladie, gin Braikley thei slay?
203A.29	 &#145;What&#146;ll cum o your ladie and bonnie young son?
	 O what&#146;ll cum o them when Braikley is gone?&#146;
203A.30	 &#145;I never will turn: do you think I will fly?
	 But here I will ficht, and here I will die.&#146;
203A.31	 &#145;Strik dogs,&#146; crys Inverey, a+end ficht till ye&#146;re slayn,
	 For we are four hundered, ye are but four men.
203A.32	 &#145;Strik, strik, ye proud boaster, your honour is gone,
	 Your lands we will plunder, your castell we&#146;ll burn.&#146;
203A.33	 At the head o the Etnach the battel began,
	 At Little Auchoilzie thei killd the first man.
203A.34	 First thei killd ane, and soon they killd twa,
	 Thei killd gallant Braikley, the flour o them a&#146;.
203A.35	 Thei killd William Gordon, and James o the Knox,
	 And brave Alexander, the flour o Glenmuick.
203A.36	 What sichin and moaning was heard i the glen,
	 For the Baronne o Braikley, who basely was slayn!
203A.37	 &#145;Cam ye bi the castell, and was ye in there?
	 Saw ye pretty Peggy tearing her hair?&#146;
203A.38	 &#145;Yes, I cam by Braikley, and I gaed in there,
	 And there [saw] his ladie braiding her hair.
203A.39	 &#145;She was rantin, and dancin, and singin for joy,
	 And vowin that nicht she woud feest Inverey.
203A.40	 &#145;She eat wi him, drank wi him, welcomd him in,
	 Was kind to the man that had slayn her baronne.&#146;
203A.41	 Up spake the son on the nourice&#146;s knee,
	 &#145;Gin I live to be a man, revenged I&#146;ll be.&#146;
203A.42	 Ther&#146;s dool i the kitchin, and mirth i the ha,
	 The Baronne o Braikley is dead and awa.

203B.1	 &#145;Baron of Brackley, are ye in there?
	 The&#146;re sharp swords at yer yetts, winna ye spear.&#146;
203B.2	 If they be gentlemen, lat them cum in;
	 But if they be reavers, we&#146;ll gar them be taen.&#146;
203B.3	 It is na gentlemen, nor yet pretty lads,
	 But a curn hir&#146;d widdifus, wears belted plaids.&#146;
203B.4	 She called on her women and bade them come in:
	 &#145;Tack a&#146; yer rocks, lasses, and we&#146;ll them coman.
203B.5	 &#145;We&#146;ll fecht them, we&#146;ll slight them, we&#146;ll do what we can,
	 And I vow we will shoot them altho we shod bang.
203B.6	 &#145;Rise up, John,&#146; she said, a+end turn in yer kye,
	 For they&#146;ll hae them to the Hielands, and you they&#146;l defie.&#146;
203B.7	 &#145;Had your still, Catharine, and still yer young son,
	 For ye&#146;ll get me out, but I&#146;ll never cum in.&#146;
203B.8	 &#145;If I had a man, as I hae na nane,
	 He wudna lye in his bed and see his kye tane.&#146;
203B.9	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll cum kiss me, my Peggy, and bring me my gun,
	 For I&#146;m gaing out, but I&#146;ll never cum in.&#146;
203B.10	 There was twenty wi Invery, twenty and ten;
	 There was nane wi the baron but his brother and him.
203B.11	 At the head of Reneeten the battle began;
	 Ere they wan Auchoilzie, they killed mony a man.
203B.12	 They killed Harry Gordon and Harry of the Knock,
	 The mullertd&#146;s four sons up at Glenmuick.
203B.13	 They killed Harry Gordon and Harry of the Knock,
	 And they made the brave baron like kail to a pot.
203B.14	 First they killed ane, and then they killed twa,
	 Then they killed the brave baron, the flower o them a&#146;.
203B.15	 Then up came Craigievar, and a party wi him[
	 If he had come an hour sooner, Brackley had not been slain.
203B.16	 &#145;Came ye by Brackley? and was ye in there?
	 Or say ye his lady, was making great care?&#146;
203B.17	 &#145;I came by Brackley, and I was in there,
	 But I saw his lady no making great care.
203B.18	 &#145;For she eat wi them, drank wi them, welcomed them in;
	 She drank to the villain that killed her guid man.
203B.19	 &#145;Woe to ye, Kate Fraser! sorry may yer heart be,
	 To see yer brave baron&#146;s blood cum to yer knee.&#146;
203B.20	 There is dule in the kitchen, and mirth i the ha,
	 But the Baron o B[r]ackley is dead and awa.
