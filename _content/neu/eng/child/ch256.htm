256A.1	 &#145;MY luve she lives in Lincolnshire,
	 I wat she&#146;s neither black nor broun,
	 But her hair is like the thread o gowd,
	 Aye an it waur weel kaim d doun.&#146;
256A.2	 She&#146;s pued the black mask owre her face,
	 An blinkit gaily wi her ee:
RR&#146;rro	 will you to my weddin come,
	 An will you bear me gude companie?&#146;
256A.3	 &#145;I winna to your weddin come,
	 Nor [will] I bear you gude companie,
	 Unless you be the bride yoursell,
	 An me the bridegroom to be.&#146;
256A.4	 &#145;For me to be the bride mysel,
	 An you the bonnie bridegroom to be-+--+-
	 Cheer up you heart, Sweet Willie,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;For that&#146;s the day you&#146;ll never see.
256A.5	 &#145;Gin you waur on your saddle set,
	 An gaily ridin on the way,
	 You&#146;ll hae nae mair mind o Alison
	 Than she waur dead an laid in clay.&#146;
256A.6	 When he was on his saiddle set,
	 An slowly ridin on the way,
	 He had mair mind o Alison
	 Than he had o the licht o day.
256A.7	 He saw a hart draw near a hare,
	 An aye that hare drew near a toun,
	 An that same hart did get a hare,
	 But the gentle knicht got neer a toun.
256A.8	 He leant him owre his saiddle-bow,
	 An his heart did brak in pieces three;
	 Wi sighen said him Sweet Willie,
	 &#145;The pains o luve hae taen hald o me.&#146;
256A.9	 . . . .
	 . . . .
	 There cam a white horse an a letter,
	 That stopped the weddin speidilie.
256A.10	 She leant her back on her bed-side,
	 An her heart did brak in pieces three;
	 She was buried an bemoaned,
	 But the birds waur Willie&#146;s companie.
