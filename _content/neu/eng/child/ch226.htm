226A.1	 * * * * *
	 OUT it spake Lizee Linzee,
	 The tear blinket in her ee;
	 How can I leave father and mother,
	 Along with young Donald to gae!
226A.2	 Out spoke Lizee&#146;s young handmaid,
	 A bonny young lassie was she;
	 Said, Were I heress to a kingdom,
	 Along with young Donald I&#146;d ga.
226A.3	 &#145;O say ye so to me, Nelly?
	 O say ye so to me?
	 Must I leave Edinburgh city,
	 To the high Highland to gae?&#146;
226A.4	 Out spoke Lizie&#146;s own mother,
	 A good old lady was she;
	 If you speak such a word to my dochter,
	 I&#146;ll gar hang [you] hi.
226A.5	 &#145;Keep well your dochter from me, madam,
	 Keep well your dochter fa me;
	 For I care as little for your dochter
	 As ye can care for me.&#146;
226A.6	 The road grew wetty and dubby,
	 And Lizee began to think lang;
	 Said, I wish had staid with my mother,
	 And nae wi young Donald had gane.
226A.7	 &#145;You&#146;r welcome hame, Sir Donald,
	 You&#146;r thrice welcome to me;
	 You&#146;r welcome hame, Sir Donald,
	 And your young lady you wi.&#146;

	 . . . .
	 &#145;Ye call na me Sir Donald,
	 But ca me Donald your son.&#146;
226A.9	 &#145;Rise up, Lizee Linzee,
	 You [have] lain too long in the day;
	 Ye might have helped my mother
	 To milch her goats and her kie.&#146;
226A.10	 Out it spake Lizee Linzee,
	 The tear blinket in her eye;
	 &#145;The ladys of Edinburgh city,
	 They neither milch goats nor kie.&#146;

	 Wi hosens and brogues and the bonnet;
	 I&#146;ll court her wi nar flattrie.&#146;
226B.4	 Whan he cam to Edinbruch city,
	 He playd at the ring and the ba,
	 And saw monie a bonnie young ladie,
	 But Lizie Lindsay was first o them a&#146;.
226B.5	 Syne, dressd in his Hieland grey plaiden,
	 His bonnet abune his ee-bree,

	 Says, Lizie, will ye fancy me?
226B.6	 &#145;And gae to the Hielands, my lassie,
	 And gae, gae wi me?
	 O gae to the Hielands, Lizie Lindsay,
	 I&#146;ll feed you on curds and green whey.
226B.7	 &#145;And ye&#146;se get a bed o green bracken,
	 My plaidie will hap thee and me;
	 Ye&#146;se lie in my arms, bonnie Lizie,
	 If ye&#146;ll gae to the Hielands wi me.&#146;
226B.8	 &#145;O how can I gae to the Hielands,
	 Or how can I gae wi thee,
	 Whan I dinna ken whare I&#146;m gaing,
	 Nor wha I hae to gae wi?&#146;
226B.9	 &#145;My father, he is an auld shepherd,
	 My mither, she is an auld dey;
	 My name it is Donald Macdonald,
	 My name I&#146;ll never deny.&#146;
226B.10	 &#145;O Donald, I&#146;ll gie ye five guineas
	 To sit ae hour in my room,
	 Till I tak aff your ruddy picture;
	 Whan I hae &#146;t, I&#146;ll never think lang.&#146;
226B.11	 &#145;I dinna care for your five guineas;
	 It&#146;s ye that&#146;s the jewel to me;
	 I&#146;ve plenty o kye in the Hielands,
	 To feed ye wi curds and green whey.
226B.12	 &#145;And ye&#146;se get a bonnie blue plaidie,
	 Wi red and green strips thro it a&#146;;
	 And I&#146;ll be the lord o your dwalling,
	 And that&#146;s the best picture ava.
226B.13	 &#145;And I am laird o a&#146; my possessions;
	 The king canna boast o na mair;
	 And ye&#146;se hae my true heart in keeping,
	 There&#146;ll be na ither een hae a share.
226B.14	 &#145;Sae gae to the Hielands, my lassie,
	 O gae awa happy wi me;
	 O gae to the Hielands, Lizie Lindsay,
	 And hird the wee lammies wi me.&#146;
226B.15	 &#145;O how can I gae wi a stranger,
	 Oure hills and oure glens frae my hame?&#146;
	 &#145;I tell ye I am Donald Macdonald;
	 I&#146;ll ever be proud o my name.&#146;
226B.16	 Doun cam Lizie Lindsay&#146;s ain father,
	 A knicht o a noble degree;
	 Says, If ye do steal my dear daughter,
	 It&#146;s hangit ye quickly sall be.
226B.17	 On his heel he turned round wi a bouncie,
	 And a licht lauch he did gie:
	 &#145;There&#146;s nae law in Edinbruch city
	 This day that can dare to hang me.&#146;
226B.18	 Then up bespak Lizie&#146;s best woman,
	 And a bonnie young lass was she;
	 &#145;Had I but a mark in my pouchie,
	 It&#146;s Donald that I wad gae wi.&#146;
226B.19	 &#145;O Helen, wad ye leave your coffer,
	 And a&#146; your silk kirtles sae braw,
	 And gang wi a bare-houghd puir laddie,
	 And leave father, mither, and a&#146;?
226B.20	 &#145;But I think he&#146;s a witch or a warlock,
	 Or something o that fell degree,
	 For I&#146;ll gae awa wi young Donald,
	 Whatever my fortune may be.&#146;
226B.21	 Then Lizie laid doun her silk mantle,
	 And put on her waiting-maid&#146;s goun,
	 And aff and awa to the Hielands
	 She&#146;s gane wi this young shepherd loun.
226B.22	 Thro glens and oure mountains they wanderd,
	 Till Lizie had scantlie a shoe;
	 &#145;Alas and ohone!&#146; says fair Lizie,
	 &#145;Sad was the first day I saw you!
	 I wish I war in Edinbruch city;
	 Fu sair, sair this pastime I rue.&#146;
226B.23	 &#145;O haud your tongue now, bonnie Lizie,
	 For yonder&#146;s the shieling, my hame;
	 And there&#146;s my guid auld honest mither,
	 That&#146;s coming to meet ye her lane.&#146;
226B.24	 &#145;O ye&#146;re welcome, ye&#146;re welcome, Sir Donald,
	 Ye&#146;re welcome hame to your ain.&#146;
	 &#145;O ca me na young Sir Donald,
	 But ca me Donald my son;&#146;
	 And this they hae spoken in Erse,
	 That Lizie micht not understand.
226B.25	 The day being weetie and daggie,
	 They lay till &#146;twas lang o the day:
	 &#145;Win up, win up, bonnie Lizie,
	 And help at the milking the kye.&#146;
226B.26	 O slowly raise up Lizie Lindsay,
	 The saut tear blindit her ee:
	 &#145;O, war I in Edinbruch city,
	 The Hielands shoud never see me!&#146;
226B.27	 He led her up to a hie mountain
	 And bade her look out far and wide:
	 &#145;I&#146;m lord o thae isles and thae mountains,
	 And ye&#146;re now my beautiful bride.
226B.28	 &#145;Sae rue na ye&#146;ve come to the Hielands,
	 Sae rue na ye&#146;ve come aff wi me,
	 For ye&#146;re great Macdonald&#146;s braw lady,
	 And will be to the day that ye dee.&#146;

226E.1	 IN Edinburgh lived a lady,
	 Was ca&#146;d Lizie Lindsay by name,
	 Was courted by mony fine suitors,
	 And mony rich person of fame:
	 Tho lords of renown had her courted,
	 Yet none her favour could gain.
226E.2	 Then spake the young laird o Kingcaussie,
	 And a bonny young boy was he;
	 &#145;Then let me a year to the city,
	 I&#146;ll come, and that lady wi me.&#146;
226E.3	 Then spake the auld laird o Kingcaussie,
	 A canty auld mannie was he;
	 &#145;What think ye by our little Donald,
	 Sae proudly and crously cracks he?
226E.4	 &#145;But he&#146;s win a year to the city,
	 If that I be a living man;
	 And what he can mak o this lady,
	 We shall lat him do as he can.&#146;
226E.5	 He&#146;s stript aff his fine costly robes,
	 And put on the single liverie;
	 With no equipage nor attendance,
	 To Edinburgh city went he.
226E.6	 Now there was a ball in the city,
	 A ball o great mirth and great fame;
	 And fa danced wi Donald that day
	 But bonny Lizie Lindsay on the green!
226E.7	 &#145;Will ye gang to the Hielands, bonny Lizie?
	 Will ye gang to the Hielands wi me?
	 Will ye leave the South Country ladies,
	 And gang to the Hielands wi me?&#146;

	 And answered him courteouslie;
	 &#145;I&#146;d like to ken faer I am gaun first,

	 And your nearest o kindred do stay.&#146;
226E.10	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll call at the Canogate-Port,
	 At the Canogate-Port call ye;
	 I&#146;ll gie you a bottle o wine,
	 And I&#146;ll bear you my companie.&#146;

	 At the Canogate-Port calld he;
	 She gae him a bottle o wine,
	 And she gae him her companie.

	 Will ye gang to the Hielands wi me?
	 Will ye leave the South Country ladies,
	 And gang to the Hielands wi me?&#146;
226E.13	 Then out spake Lizie&#146;s auld mither,
	 For a very auld lady was she;
	 &#145;If ye cast ony creed on my dochter,
	 High hanged I&#146;ll cause you to be.&#146;
226E.14	 &#145;O keep hame your dochter, auld woman,
	 And latna her gang wi me;
	 I can cast nae mair creed on your dochter,
	 Nae mair than she can on me.&#146;
226E.15	 &#145;Now, young man, ae question I&#146;ll ask you,
	 Sin ye mean to honour us sae;
	 Ye&#146;ll tell me how braid your lands lie,
	 Your name, and faer ye hae to gae.&#146;
226E.16	 &#145;My father he is an auld soutter,
	 My mither she is an auld dey,
	 And I&#146;m but a puir broken trooper,
	 My kindred I winna deny.
226E.17	 &#145;Yet I&#146;m nae a man o great honour,
	 Nor am I a man o great fame;
	 My name it is Donald M&#146;Donald,
	 I&#146;ll tell it, and winna think shame.
226E.18	 &#145;Will ye gang to the Hielands, bonny Lizie?
	 Will ye gang to the Hielands wi me?
	 Will ye leave the South Country ladies,
	 And gang to the Hielands wi me?&#146;
226E.19	 &#145;O Donald, I&#146;ll gie you ten guineas,
	 If ye woud but stay in my room
	 Until that I draw your fair picture,
	 To look on it fan I think lang.&#146;
226E.20	 &#145;No, I carena mair for your guineas,
	 Nae mair than ye care for mine;
	 But if that ye love my ain person,
	 Gae wi me, maid, if ye incline.&#146;
226E.21	 Then out spake Lizie&#146;s bower-woman,
	 And a bonny young lassie was she;
	 Tho I was born heir to a crown,
	 Young Donald, I woud gang him wi.
226E.22	 Up raise then the bonny young lady,
	 And drew till her stockings and sheen,
	 And packd up her claise in fine bundles,
	 And awa wi young Donald she&#146;s gane.
226E.23	 The roads they were rocky and knabby,
	 The mountains were baith strait and stay;
	 When Lizie grew wearied wi travel,
	 For she&#146;d travelld a very lang way.
226E.24	 &#145;O turn again, bonny Lizie Lindsay,
	 O turn again,&#146; said he;
	 &#145;We&#146;re but ae day&#146;s journey frae town,
	 O turn, and I&#146;ll turn wi thee.&#146;
226E.25	 Out speaks the bonny young lady,
	 Till the saut tear blinded her ee;
	 Altho I&#146;d return to the city,
	 There&#146;s nae person woud care for me.
226E.26	 When they came near the end o their journey,
	 To the house o their father&#146;s milk-dey,
	 He said, Stay still there, Lizie Lindsay,
	 Till I tell my mither o thee.
226E.27	 When he came into the shielen,
	 She hailed him courteouslie;
	 Said, Ye&#146;re welcome hame, Sir Donald,
	 There&#146;s been mony ane calling for thee.
226E.28	 &#145;O ca me na mair, Sir Donald,
	 But Donald M&#146;Donald your son;
	 We&#146;ll carry the joke a bit farther,
	 There&#146;s a bonny young lady to come.&#146;
226E.29	 When Lizie came into the shielen,
	 She lookd as if she&#146;d been a feel;
	 She sawna a seat to sit down on,
	 But only some sunks o green feall.
226E.30	 &#145;Now make us a supper, dear mither,
	 The best o your cruds and green whey;
	 And make us a bed o green rashes,
	 And covert wi huddins sae grey.&#146;
226E.31	 But Lizie being wearied wi travel,
	 She lay till &#146;twas up i the day:
	 &#145;Ye might hae been up an hour seener,
	 To milk baith the ewes and the kye.&#146;
226E.32	 Out then speaks the bonny young lady,
	 Whan the saut tear drapt frae her eye;
	 I wish that I had bidden at hame,
	 I can neither milk ewes nor kye.
226E.33	 &#145;I wish that I had bidden at hame,
	 The Hielands I never had seen,
	 Altho I love Donald M&#146;Donald,
	 The laddie wi Blythe blinking een.&#146;
226E.34	 &#145;Win up, win up, O bonny Lizie,
	 And dress in the silks sae gay;
	 I&#146;ll show you the yetts o Kingcaussie,
	 Whare I&#146;ve playd me mony a day.&#146;
226E.35	 Up raise the bonny young lady,
	 And drest in thd silks sae fine,
	 And into young Donald&#146;s arms
	 Awa to Kingcaussie she&#146;s gane.
226E.36	 Forth came the auld laird o Kingcaussie,
	 And hailed her courteouslie;
	 Says, Ye&#146;re welcome, bonny Lizie Lindsay,
	 Ye&#146;re welcome hame to me.
226E.37	 &#145;Tho lords o renown hae you courted,
	 Young Donald your favour has won;
	 Ye&#146;se get a&#146; the lands o Kingcaussie,
	 And Donald M&#146;Donald, my son.&#146;

	 &#145;Will ye lea yere ain kintra, Lizzie,
	 An gang to the Hielands wi me?&#146;
226F.3	 She turned her roun on her heel,
	 An a very loud laughter gaed she:
	 &#145;I wad like to ken whar I was ganging,
	 And wha I was gaun to gang wi.&#146;
226F.4	 &#145;My name is young Donald M&#146;Donald,
	 My name I will never deny;
	 My father he is an auld shepherd,
	 Sae weel as he can herd the kye!
226F.5	 &#145;My father he is an auld shepherd,

	 And bore him guid companie.
226F.8	 &#145;Will ye go to the Hielands, bonnie Lizzie?
	 Will ye go to the Hielands wi me?
	 If ye&#146;ll go to the Hielands, bonnie Lizzie,
	 Ye shall not want curds nor green whey.&#146;
226F.9	 In there cam her auld mither,
	 A jolly auld lady was she:
	 &#145;I wad like to ken whar she was ganging,
	 And wha she was gaun to gang wi.&#146;
226F.10	 &#145;My name is young Donald M&#146;Donald,
	 My name I will never deny;
	 My father he is an auld shepherd,
	 Sae weel as he can herd the kye!
226F.11	 &#145;O but I would give you ten guineas
	 To have her one hour in a room,
	 To get her fair body a picture,
	 To keep me from thinking long.&#146;
226F.12	 &#145;O I value not your ten guineas,
	 As little as you value mine;
	 But if that you covet my daughter,
	 Take her with you, if you do incline.&#146;
226F.13	 &#145;Pack up my silks and my satins,
	 And pack up my hose and my shoon,
	 And likewise my clothes in small bundles,
	 And away wi young Donald I&#146;ll gang.&#146;
226F.14	 They packd up her silks and her satins,
	 They packd up her hose and her shoon,
	 And likewise her clothes in small bundles,
	 And away wi young Donald she&#146;s gane.
226F.15	 When that they cam to the Hielands,
	 The braes they were baith lang and stey;
	 Bonnie Lizzie was wearied wi ganging,
	 She had travelld a lang summer day.
226F.16	 &#145;O are we near hame, Sir Donald?
	 O are we near hame, I pray?&#146;
	 &#145;We&#146;re no near hame, bonnie Lizzie,
	 Nor yet the half o the way.&#146;
226F.17	 They cam to a homely poor cottage,
	 An auld man was stnading by:
	 &#145;Ye&#146;re welcome hame, Sir Donald,
	 Ye&#146;ve been sae lang away.&#146;
226F.18	 &#145;O call me no more Sir Donald,
	 But call me young Donald your son,
	 For I have a bonnie young lady
	 Behind me for to come in.&#146;
226F.19	 &#145;Come in, come in, bonnie Lizzie,
	 Come in, come in,&#146; said he;
	 &#145;Although that our cottage be little,
	 Perhaps the better we&#146;ll gree.
226F.20	 &#145;O make us a supper, dear mother,
	 And make it of curds an green whey;
	 And make us a bed o green rushes,
	 And cover it oer wi green hay.&#146;
	 * * * * *
226F.21	 &#145;Rise up, rise up, bonnie Lizzie,
	 Why lie ye so long in the day?
	 Ye might hae been helping my mother
	 To make the curds and green whey.&#146;
226F.22	 &#145;O haud your tongue, Sir Donald,
	 O haud your tongue, I pray;
	 I wish I had neer left my mother;
	 I can neither make curds nor whey.&#146;
226F.23	 &#145;Rise up, rise up, bonnie Lizzie,
	 And put on your satins so fine,
	 For we maun to be at Kincassie
	 Before that the clock strikes nine.&#146;
226F.24	 But when they came to Kincassie
	 The porter was standing by:
	 &#145;Ye&#146;re welcome home, Sir Donald,
	 Ye&#146;ve been so long away.&#146;
226F.25	 It&#146;s down then came his auld mither,
	 With all the keys in her hand,
	 Saying, Take you these, bonnie Lizzie,
	 All under them&#146;s at your command.

	 Will you go to the Highlands wi me?
	 Will you go to the Highlands wi me, Leezie?
	 And you shall have curds and green whey.&#146;
226G.2	 Then up spoke Leezie&#146;s mother,
	 A gallant old lady was she;
	 &#145;If you talk so to my daughter,
	 High hanged I&#146;ll gar you be.&#146;
226G.3	 And then she changed her coaties,
	 And then she changed them to green,
	 And then she changed her coaties,
	 Young Donald to gang wi.
226G.4	 But the roads grew broad and broad,
	 And the mountains grew high and high,
	 Which caused many a tear
	 To fall from Leezie&#146;s eye.
226G.5	 But the roads grew broad and broad,
	 And the mountains grew high and high,
	 Till they came to the glens of Glen Koustie,
	 And out there came an old die.

	 But call me Donald your son,
	 And I will call you mother,
	 Till this long night be done.&#146;
226G.8	 These words were spoken in Gaelic,
	 And Leezie did not them ken;
	 These words were spoken in Gaelic,
	 And then plain English began.
226G.9	 &#145;O make her a supper, mother,
	 O make her a supper wi me;
	 O make her a supper, mother,
	 Of curds and green whey.&#146;

226G.10	 &#145;You must get up, Leezie Lindsay,
	 . . . .
	 You must get up, Leezie Lindsay,

226G.11	 And then they went out together,
	 And a braw new bigging saw she,
	 And out cam Lord Macdonald,
	 And his gay companie.
226G.12	 &#145;You&#146;re welcome here, Leezie Lindsay,
	 The flower of a&#146; your kin,
	 And you shall be Lady Macdonald,
	 Since you have got Donald, my son.&#146;
