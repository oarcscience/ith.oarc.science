<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">156A: Queen Eleanor&#146;s Confession</H1>
<PRE>

156A.1	 QUEEN ELENOR was a sick woman,
	 And afraid that she should dye;
	 Then she sent for two fryars of France,
	 For to speak with them speedily.
156A.2	 The King calld down his nobles all,
	 By one, by two, and by three,
	 And sent away for Earl Martial,
	 For to speak with him speedily.
156A.3	 When that he came before the King,
	 He fell on his bended knee;
	 A boon, a boon! our gracious king,
	 That you sent so hastily.&#146;
156A.4	 &#145;I&#146;ll pawn my living and my lands,
	 My septer and my crown,
	 That whatever Queen Elenor says,
	 I will not write it down.
156A.5	 &#145;Do you put on one fryar&#146;s coat,
	 And I&#146;ll put on another,
	 And we will to Queen Elenor go,
	 one fryar like another.&#146;
156A.6	 Thus both attired then they go;
	 When they came to Whitehall,
	 The bells they did ring, and the quiristers sing,
	 And the torches did light them all.
156A.7	 When that they came before the Queen,
	 They fell on their bended knee:
	 &#145;A boon, a boon! our gracious queen,
	 That you sent so hastily.&#146;
156A.8	 &#145;Are you two fryars of France?&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Which I suppose you be;
	 But if you are two English fryars,
	 Then hanged you shall be.&#146;
156A.9	 &#145;We are two fryars of France,&#146; they said,
	 &#145;As you suppose we be;
	 We have not been at any mass
	 Since we came from the sea.&#146;
156A.10	 &#145;The first vile thing that ere I did
	 I will to you unfold;
	 Earl Martial had my maidenhead,
	 Underneath this cloath of gold.&#146;
156A.11	 at is a vile sin,&#146; then said the king,
	 &#145;God may forgive it thee!&#146;
	 &#145;Amen! Amen!&#146; quoth Earl Martial,
	 With a heavy heart then spoke he.
156A.12	 &#145;The next vile thing that ere I did
	 To you I&#146;ll  not deny;
	 I made a box of poyson strong,
	 To poyson King Henry.&#146;
156A.13	 &#145;That is a vile sin,&#146; then said the King,
	 &#145;God may forgive it thee!&#146;
	 &#145;Amen! Amen!&#146; quoth Earl Martial,
	 &#145;And I wish it so may be.&#146;
156A.14	 &#145;The next vile thing that ere I did
	 To you I will discover;
	 I poysoned Fair Rosamond,
	 All in fair Woodstock bower.&#146;
156A.15	 &#145;That is a vile sin,&#146; then said the King,
	 &#145;God may forgive it thee!&#146;
	 &#145;Amen! Amen!&#146; quoth Earl Martial,
	 &#145;And I wish it so may be.&#146;
156A.16	 &#145;Do you see yonders little boy,
	 A tossing of that ball?
	 That is Earl Martial[&#146;s] eldest son,
	 And I love him the best of all.
156A.17	 &#145;Do you see yonders little boy,
	 A catching of the ball?
	 That is King Henry&#146;s son,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;And I love him the worst of all.
156A.18	 &#145;His head is like unto a bull,
	 His nose is like a boar;&#146;
	 &#145;No matter for that,&#146; King Henry said,
	 &#145;I love him the better therefore.&#146;
156A.19	 The King pulld of his fryar&#146;s coat,
	 And appeard all in red;
	 She shriekd and she cry&#146;d, she wrong her hands,
	 And said she was betrayd.
156A.20	 The King lookd over his left shoulder,
	 And a grim look looked he,
	 And said,Earl Martial, but for my oath,
	 Then hanged shouldst thou be.

	 O yonder is the Earl Marshall&#146;s son,
	 And I like him best of all.
156F.21	 &#145;O don&#146;t you see yon other little boy,
	 Playing at the football?
	 O that one is King Henrie&#146;s son,
	 And I like him worst of all.
156F.22	 &#145;His head is like a black bull&#146;s head,
	 His feet are like a bear;&#146;
	 &#145;What matter! what matter!&#146; cried the King,
	 &#145;He&#146;s my son, and my only heir.&#146;
156F.23	 The King plucked off his fryar&#146;s gowne,
	 And stood in his scarlet so red;
	 The Queen she turned herself in bed,
	 And cryed that she was betrayde.
156F.24	 The King lookt oer his left shoulder,
	 And a grim look looked he;
	 &#145;Earl Marshall,&#146; he said, &#146;But for my oath,
	 Thou hadst swung on the gallowes-tree.&#146;

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">156[G]: Queen Eleanor&#146;s Confession</H3>
<PRE>

156[G].1	The queen of England she is seek,
	 And seek and like to dee;
	 She has sent for friers out of France,
	 To bespeek hir speed[i]ly.
156[G.2]	The king has cald on his merrymen,
	 By thirtys and by threes;
	 Earl Marshall should have been the formest man,
	 But the very last man was he.
156[G.3]	&#145;The queen of England s[h]e is seek,
	 And seek and like to dee,
	 And she has sent for friers out of France,
	 To bespeek hir speedyly.
156[G.4]	&#145;But I will put on a frier&#146;s weeg,
	 And ye&#146;l put on another,
	 And we&#146;ll away to Quenn Helen gaits,
	 Like friers both together.&#146;
156[G.5]	&#145;O no, no,&#146; says Earl Marshall,
	 &#145;For this it must not be;
	 For if the queen get word of that,
	 High hanged I will be.&#146;
156[G.6]	&#145;But I will swear by my septer and crown,
	 And by the seas so free,
	 I will swear by my septer and crown,
	 Earl Marshall, thow&#146;s no dee.&#146;
156[G.7]	So he has put on a frier&#146;s wig,
	 And the king has put on another,
	 And they are away to Queen Helen gaits,
	 Like friers both together.
156[G.8]	When they came to Queen Helen gaits,
	 They tirled at the pin;
	 There was non so ready as the queene herself
	 To open and let them in.
156[G.9]	&#145;O are you two Scottish dogs?-+-
	 And hanged you shall be-+-
	 Or are [you] friers come out of France,
	 To bespeek me speedily?&#146;
156[G.10]	&#145;We are not two Scottish dogs,
	 Nor hanged we shall be;
	 For we have not spoken a wrong word
	 Since we came over the sea.&#146;
156[G.11]	&#145;Well then, the very first that ever I sind
	 I freely confess to thee;
	 Earl Marshall took my maidenhead
	 Below yon greenwood tree.&#146;
156[G.12]	&#145;That is a sin, and very great sin,
	 But the Pope will pardon thee;&#146;
	 &#145;Amene, Amene,&#146; says Earl Marshall,
	 But a feert, feert heart had he.
156[G.13]	&#145;The very next sin that ever I sind
	 I freely confess to thee;
	 I had [poisen] seven years in  my breast
	 To poisen King Hendry.&#146;
156[G.14]	&#145;That is a sin, and very great sin,
	 But the Pope forgiveth thee;&#146;
	 &#145;Amene, Amene,&#146; says Earl Marshall,
	 But a feert, feert heart had he.
156[G.15]	&#145;The very next sin that ever I sind
	 I freely confess to thee;
	 I poisened one of my court&#146;s ladies,
	 Was far more fairer than me.&#146;
156[G.16]	&#145;That is a sin, and a very great sin,
	 But the Pope forgiveth thee;&#146;
	 &#145;Amene, Amene,&#146; says Earl Marshall,
	 But a feert, feert heart had he.
156[G.17]	&#145;Do you see yon bony boys,
	 Playing at the baw?
	 The oldest of them is Earl Marshall&#146;s,
	 And I like him best of all.&#146;
156[G.18]	&#145;That is a sin, and very great sin,
	 But the Pope forgiveth thee;&#146;
	 &#145;Amene, Amene,&#146; says Earl Marshall,
	 But a feert, feert heart had he.
156[G.19]	&#145;Do ye see two bony [boys],
	 Playing at the baw?
	 The youngest of them is King Hendry&#146;s,
	 And I like him worst of all.
156[G.20]	&#145;Because he is headed like a bull,
	 And his nose is like a boar;&#146;
	 &#145;What is the matter?&#146; says King Henry,
	 &#145;For he shall be my heir.&#146;
156[G.21]	Now he put off his frier&#146;s wig,
	 And drest himself [in] red;
	 She wrung hir hands, and tore hir hair,
	 And s[w]ore she was betraid.
156[G.22]	&#145;Had I not sworn by my septer and crown,
	 And by the seas so free,
	 Had I not sworn by my septer and crown,
	 Earl Marshall, thowst have died.&#146;
