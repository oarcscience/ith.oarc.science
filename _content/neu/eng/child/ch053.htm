	And a bottle o his ae best wine,
	And neer forget that lady fair
	That did him out o prison bring.&#146;
53B.14	The porter tripped up the stair,
	And fell low down upon his knee:
	&#145;Rise up, rise up, ye proud porter,
	What mean you by this courtesie?&#146;
53B.15	&#145;O I hae been porter at your yett

	And ay the fairer may ye be!
	But the fairest day that eer ye saw,

	Except a kiss o her bonny lips,
	Of her body I am free;
	She came to me on a single horse,
	Now I&#146;ll send her hame in chariots three.&#146;
53B.23	He&#146;s taen her by the milk-white hand,
	And he&#146;s led her to a yard o stane;
	He&#146;s changed her name frae Susan Pye,
	And calld her lusty Lady Jane.

	But he was taen by a savage Moor,
	Who handled him right cruellie.
53E.2	For he viewed the fashions of that land,
	Their way of worship viewed he,
	But to Mahound or Termagant
	Would Beichan never bend a knee.
53E.3	So in every shoulder they&#146;ve putten a bore,
	In every bore they&#146;ve putten a tree,
	And they have made him trail the wine
	And spices on his fair bodie.
53E.4	They&#146;ve casten him in a dungeon deep,
	Where he could neither hear nor see,
	For seven years they kept him there,
	Till he for hunger&#146;s like to die.
53E.5	This Moor he had but ae daughter,
	Her name was called Susie Pye,
	And every day as she took the air,
	Near Beichan&#146;s prison she passed by.
53E.6	O so it fell upon a day
	She heard Young Beichan sadly sing:
	&#145;My hounds they all go masterless,
	My hawks they flee from tree to tree,
	My younger brother will heir my land,
	Fair England again I&#146;ll never see!&#146;
53E.7	All night long no rest she got,
	Young Beichan&#146;s song for thinking on;
	She&#146;s stown the keys from her father&#146;s head,
	And to the prison strong is gone.
53E.8	And she has opend the prison doors,
	I wot she opend two or three,
	Ere she could come Young Beichan at,
	He was locked up so curiouslie.
53E.9	But when she came Young Beichan before,
	Sore wonderd he that may to see;
	He took her for some fair captive:
	&#145;Fair Lady, I pray, of what countrie?&#146;
53E.10	&#145;O have ye any lands,&#146; she said,
	&#145;Or castles in your own countrie,
	That ye could give to a lady fair,
	From prison strong to set you free?&#146;
53E.11	&#145;Near London town I have a hall,
	With other castles two or three;
	I&#146;ll give them all to the lady fair
	That out of prison will set me free.&#146;
53E.12	&#145;Give me the truth of your right hand,
	The truth of it give unto me,
	That for seven years ye&#146;ll no lady wed,
	Unless it be along with me.&#146;
53E.13	&#145;I&#146;ll give thee the truth of my right hand,
	The truth of it I&#146;ll freely gie,
	That for seven years I&#146;ll stay unwed,
	For the kindness thou dost show to me.&#146;
53E.14	And she has brib&#146;d the proud warder
	Wi mickle gold and white monie,
	She&#146;s gotten the keys of the prison strong,
	And she has set Young Beichan free.
53E.15	She&#146;s gien him to eat the good spice-cake,
	She&#146;s gien him to drink the blood-red wine,
	She&#146;s bidden him sometimes think on her,
	That sae kindly freed him out of pine.
53E.16	She&#146;s broken a ring from her finger,
	And to Beichan half of it gave she:
	&#145;Keep it, to mind you of that love
	The lady bore that set you free.
53E.17	&#145;And set your foot on good ship-board,
	And haste ye back to your own countrie,
	And before that seven years have an end,
	Come back again, love, and marry me.&#146;
53E.18	But long ere seven years had an end,
	She longd full sore her love to see,
	For ever a voice within her breast
	Said, &#145;Beichan has broke his vow to thee:&#146;
	So she&#146;s set her foot on good ship-board,
	And turnd her back on her own countrie.
53E.19	She sailed east, she sailed west,
	Till to fair England&#146;s shore she came,
	Where a bonny shepherd she espied,
	Feeding his sheep upon the plain.
53E.20	&#145;What news, what news, thou bonny shepherd?
	What news hast thou to tell to me?&#146;
	&#145;Such news I hear, ladie,&#146; he says,
	&#145;The like was never in this countrie.
53E.21	&#145;There is a wedding in yonder hall,
	Has lasted these thirty days and three;
	Young Beichan will not bed with his bride,
	For love of one that&#146;s yond the sea.&#146;
53E.22	She&#146;s put her hand in her pocket,
	Gien him the gold and white monie:
	&#145;Hae, take ye that, my bonny boy,
	For the good news thou tellst to me.&#146;
53E.23	When she came to Young Beichan&#146;s gate,
	She tirled softly at the pin;
	So ready was the proud porter
	To open and let this lady in.
53E.24	&#145;Is this Young Beichan&#146;s hall,&#146; she said,
	&#145;O is that noble lord within?&#146;
	&#145;Yea, he&#146;s in the hall among them all,
	And this is the day o his weddin.&#146;
53E.25	&#145;And has he wed anither love?
	And has he clean forgotten me?&#146;
	And sighin said that gay ladie,
	I wish I were in my own countrie!
53E.26	And she has taen her gay gold ring,
	That with her love she brake so free;
	Says, Gie him that, ye proud porter,
	And bid the bridegroom speak to me.
53E.27	When the porter came his lord before,
	He kneeled down low on his knee:
	&#145;What aileth thee, my proud porter,
	Thou art so full of courtesie?&#146;
53E.28	&#145;I&#146;ve been porter at your gates,
	It&#146;s thirty long years now and three;
	But there stands a lady at them now,
	The like o her did I never see.
53E.29	&#145;For on every finger she has a ring,
	And on her mid-finger she has three,
	And as meickle gold aboon her brow
	As would buy an earldom to me.&#146;
53E.30	It&#146;s out then spak the bride&#146;s mother,
	Aye and an angry woman was shee:
	&#145;Ye might have excepted our bonny bride,
	And twa or three of our companie.&#146;
53E.31	&#145;O hold your tongue, thou bride&#146;s mother,
	Of all your folly let me be;
	She&#146;s ten times fairer nor the bride,
	And all that&#146;s in your companie.
53E.32	&#145;She begs one sheave of your white bread,
	But and a cup of your red wine,
	And to remember the lady&#146;s love
	That last relievd you out of pine.&#146;
53E.33	&#145;O well-a-day!&#146; said Beichan then,
	&#145;That I so soon have married thee!
	For it can be none but Susie Pye,
	That sailed the sea for love of me.&#146;
53E.34	And quickly hied he down the stair;
	Of fifteen steps he made but three;
	He&#146;s taen his bonny love in his arms,
	And kist and kist her tenderlie.
53E.35	&#145;O hae ye taen anither bride?
	And hae ye quite forgotten me?
	And hae ye quite forgotten her
	That gave your life and libertie?&#146;
53E.36	She looked oer her left shoulder,
	To hide the tears stood in her ee:
	&#145;Now fare thee well, Young Beichan,&#146; she says,
	&#145;I&#146;ll try to think no more on thee.&#146;
53E.37	&#145;O never, never, Susie Pye,
	For surely this can never be,
	Nor ever shall I wed but her
	That&#146;s done and dreed so much for me.&#146;
53E.38	Then out and spak the forenoon bride:
	&#145;My lord, your love it changeth soon;
	This morning I was made your bride,
	And another chose ere it be noon.&#146;
53E.39	O hold thy tongue, thou forenoon bride,
	Ye&#146;re neer a whit the worse for me,
	And whan ye return to your own countrie,
	A double dower I&#146;ll send with thee.&#146;
53E.40	He&#146;s taen Susie Pye by the white hand,
	And gently led her up and down,
	And ay as he kist her red rosy lips,
	&#145;Ye&#146;re welcome, jewel, to your own.&#146;
53E.41	He&#146;s taen her by the milk-white hand,
	And led her to yon fountain stane;
	He&#146;s changed her name from Susie Pye,
	And he&#146;s call&#146;d her his bonny love, Lady Jane.

53F.1	IN the lands whre Lord Beichan was born,
	Amang the stately steps of stane,
	He wore the goud at his left shoulder,
	But to the Holy Land he&#146;s gane.
53F.2	He was na lang in the Holy Land,
	Amang the Prudents that was black,
	He was na lang in the Holy Land,
	Till the Prudent did Lord Beichan tak.
53F.3	The gard him draw baith pleugh and harrow,
	And horse and oxen twa or three;
	They cast him in a dark dungeon,
	Whare he coud neither hear nor see.
53F.4	The Prudent had a fair daughter,
	I wot they ca&#146;d her Susy Pye,
	And all the keys in that city
	Hang at that lady by and bye.
53F.5	It once fell out upon a day
	That into the prison she did gae,
	And whan she cam to the prison door,
	She kneeled low down on her knee.
53F.6	&#145;O hae ye ony lands, Beichan,

	And she&#146;s gaen murnin to the sea,
	Then to her father she has gane in,
	Wha spak to her right angrily.

	I pray ye open and let me in.
53F.18	&#145;And O is this Lord Beichan&#146;s yett,

	And changed her name from Susy Pye,
	And ca&#146;d her lusty Lady Jane.
53F.31	&#145;O fye, gar cooks mak ready meat,

<PRE>

53H.1	YOUNG BEICHAN was in London born,
	He was a man of hie degree;
	He past thro monie kingdoms great,
	Until he cam unto Grand Turkie.
53H.2	He viewd the fashions of that land,
	Their way of worship viewed he,
	But unto onie of their stocks
	He wadna sae much as bow a knee:
53H.3	Which made him to be taken straight,
	And brought afore their hie jurie;
	The savage Moor did speak upricht,
	And made him meikle ill to dree.
53H.4	In ilka shoulder they&#146;ve bord a hole,
	And in ilka hole they&#146;ve put a tree;
	They&#146;ve made him to draw carts and wains,
	Till he was sick and like to dee.
53H.5	But Young Beichan was a Christian born,
	And still a Christian was he;
	Which made them put him in prison strang,
	And cauld and hunger sair to dree,
	And fed on nocht but bread and water,
	Until the day that he mot dee.
53H.6	In this prison there grew a tree,
	And it was unco stout and strang,
	Where he was chained by the middle,
	Until his life was almaist gane.
53H.7	The savage Moor had but ae dochter,
	And her name it was Susie Pye,
	And ilka day as she took the air,
	The prison door she passed bye.
53H.8	But it fell ance upon a day,
	As she was walking, she heard him sing;
	She listend to his tale of woe,
	A happy day for Young Beichan!
53H.9	&#145;My hounds they all go masterless,
	My hawks they flee frae tree to tree,
	My youngest brother will heir my lands,
	My native land I&#146;ll never see.&#146;
53H.10	&#145;O were I but the prison-keeper,
	As I&#146;m a ladie o hie degree,
	I soon wad set this youth at large,
	And send him to his ain countrie.&#146;
53H.11	She went away into her chamber,
	All nicht she never closd her ee;
	And when the morning begoud to dawn,
	At the prison door alane was she.
53H.12	She gied the keeper a piece of gowd,
	And monie pieces o white monie,
	To tak her thro the bolts and bars,
	The lord frae Scotland she langd to see;
	She saw young Beichan at the stake,
	Which made her weep maist bitterlie.
53H.13	&#145;O hae ye got onie lands,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Or castles in your ain countrie?
	It&#146;s what wad ye gie to the ladie fair
	Wha out o prison wad set you free?&#146;
53H.14	&#145;It&#146;s I hae houses, and I hae lands,
	Wi monie castles fair to see,
	And I wad gie a&#146; to that ladie gay,
	Wha out o prison wad set me free.&#146;
53H.15	The keeper syne brak aff his chains,
	And set Lord Beichan at libertie;
	She filld his pockets baith wi gowd,
	To tak him till his ain countrie.
53H.16	She took him frae her father&#146;s prison,
	And gied to him the best o wine,
	And a brave health she drank to him:
	&#145;I wish, Lord Beichan, ye were mine!
53H.17	&#145;It&#146;s seven lang years I&#146;ll mak a vow,
	And seven lang years I&#146;ll keep it true;
	If ye&#146;ll wed wi na ither woman,
	It&#146;s I will wed na man but you.&#146;
53H.18	She&#146;s tane him to her father&#146;s port,
	And gien to him a ship o fame:
	&#145;Farewell, farewell, my Scottish lord,
	I fear I&#146;ll neer see you again.&#146;
53H.19	Lord Beichan turnd him round about,
	And lowly, lowly loutit he:
	&#145;Ere seven lang years come to an end,
	I&#146;ll tak you to mine ain countrie.&#146;
	* * * * *
53H.20	Then whan he cam to Glosgow town,
	A happy, happy man was he;
	The ladies a&#146; around him thrangd,
	To see him come frae slaverie.
53H.21	His mother she had died o sorrow,
	And a&#146; his brothers were dead but he;
	His lands they a&#146; were lying waste,
	In ruins were his castles free.
53H.22	Na porter there stood at his yett,
	Na human creature he could see,
	Except the screeching owls and bats,
	Had he to bear him companie.
53H.23	But gowd will gar the castles grow,
	And he had gowd and jewels free,
	And soon the pages around him thrangd,
	To serve him on their bended knee.
53H.24	His hall was hung wi silk and satin,
	His table rung wi mirth and glee,
	He soon forgot the lady fair
	That lowsd him out o slaverie.
53H.25	Lord Beichan courted a lady gay,
	To heir wi him his lands sae free,
	Neer thinking that a lady fair
	Was on her way frae Grand Turkie.
53H.26	For Susie Pye could get na rest,
	Nor day nor nicht could happy be,
	Still thinking on the Scottish lord,
	Till she was sick and like to dee.
53H.27	But she has builded a bonnie ship,
	Weel mannd wi seamen o hie degree,
	And secretly she stept on board,
	And bid adieu to her ain countrie.
53H.28	But whan she cam to the Scottish shore,
	The bells were ringing sae merrilie;
	It was Lord Beichan&#146;s wedding day,
	Wi a lady fair o hie degree.
53H.29	But sic a vessel was never seen;
	The very masts were tappd wi gold,
	Her sails were made o the satin fine,
	Maist beautiful for to behold.
53H.30	But whan the lady cam on shore,
	Attended wi her pages three,
	Her shoon were of the beaten gowd,
	And she a lady of great beautie.
53H.31	Then to the skipper she did say,
	&#145;Can ye this answer gie to me?
	Where are Lord Beichan&#146;s lands sae braid?
	He surely lives in this countrie.&#146;
53H.32	Then up bespak the skipper bold,
	For he could speak the Turkish tongue:
	&#145;Lord Beichan lives not far away;
	This is the day of his wedding.&#146;
53H.33	&#145;If ye will guide me to Beichan&#146;s yetts,
	I will ye well reward,&#146; said she;
	Then she and all her pages went,
	A very gallant companie.
53H.34	When she cam to Lord Beichan&#146;s yetts,
	She tirld gently at the pin;
	Sae ready was the proud porter
	To let the wedding guests come in.
53H.35	&#145;Is this Lord Beichan&#146;s house,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Or is that noble lord within?&#146;
	&#145;Yes, he is gane into the hall,
	With his brave bride and monie ane.&#146;
53H.36	&#145;Ye&#146;ll bid him send me a piece of bread,
	Bot and a cup of his best wine;
	And bid him mind the lady&#146;s love
	That ance did lowse him out o pyne.&#146;
53H.37	Then in and cam the porter bold,
	I wat he gae three shouts and three:
	&#145;The fairest lady stands at your yetts
	That ever my twa een did see.&#146;
53H.38	Then up bespak the bride&#146;s mither,
	I wat an angry woman was she:
	&#145;You micht hae excepted our bonnie bride,
	Tho she&#146;d been three times as fair as she.&#146;
53H.39	&#145;My dame, your daughter&#146;s fair enough,
	And aye the fairer mot she be!
	But the fairest time that eer she was,
	She&#146;ll na compare wi this ladie.
53H.40	&#145;She has a gowd ring on ilka finger,
	And on her mid-finger she has three;
	She has as meikle gowd upon her head

53I.1	IN London was Young Bechin born,
	Foreign nations he longed to see;
	He passed through many kingdoms great,
	At length he came unto Turkie.
53I.2	He viewed the fashions of that land,
	The ways of worship viewed he,
	But unto any of their gods
	He would not so much as bow the knee.
53I.3	every shoulder they made a bore,
	In every bore they put a tree,
	Then they made him the winepress tread,
	And all in spite of his fair bodie.
53I.4	They put him into a deep dungeon,
	Where he could neither hear nor see,
	And for seven years they kept him there,
	Till for hunger he was like to die.
53I.5	Stephen, their king, had a daughter fair,
	Yet never a man to her came nigh;
	And every day she took the air,
	Near to his prison she passed by.
53I.6	One day she heard Young Bechin sing
	A song that pleased her so well,
	No rest she got till she came to him,
	All in his lonely prison cell.
53I.7	&#145;I have a hall in London town,
	With other buildings two or three,
	And I&#146;ll give them all to the ladye fair
	That from this dungeon shall set me free.&#146;
53I.8	She stole the keys from her dad&#146;s head,
	And if she oped one door ay she opened three,
	Till she Young Bechin could find out,
	He was locked up so curiouslie.
	* * * * *
53I.9	&#145;I&#146;ve been a porter at your gate
	This thirty years now, ay and three;
	There stands a ladye at your gate,
	The like of her I neer did see.
53I.10	&#145;On every finger she has a ring,
	On the mid-finger she has three;
	She&#146;s as much gold about her brow
	As would an earldom buy to me.&#146;
	* * * * *
53I.11	He&#146;s taen her by the milk-white hand,
	He gently led her through the green;
	He changed her name from Susie Pie,
	An he&#146;s called her lovely Ladye Jean.

53L.1	LORD BATEMAN was a noble lord,
	A noble lord of high degree;
	He shipped himself all aboard of a ship,
	Some foreign country for to see.
53L.2	He sailed east, he sailed west,
	Until he came to famed Turkey,
	Where he was taken and put to prison,
	Until his life was quite weary.
53L.3	All in this prison there grew a tree,
	O there it grew so stout and strong!
	Where he was chained all by the middle,
	Until his life was almost gone.
53L.4	This Turk he had one only daughter,
	The fairest my two eyes eer see;
	She steel the keys of her father&#146;s prison,
	And swore Lord Bateman she would let go free.
53L.5	O she took him to her father&#146;s cellar,
	And gave to him the best of wine;
	And every health she drank unto him
	Was, &#145;I wish, Lord Bateman, as you was mine.&#146;
53L.6	&#145;O have you got houses, have you got land,
	And does Northumberland belong to thee?
	And what would you give to the fair young lady
	As out of prison would let you go free?&#146;
53L.7	&#145;O I&#146;ve got houses and I&#146;ve got land,
	And half Northumberland belongs to me;
	And I will give it all to the fair young lady
	As out of prison would let me go free.&#146;
53L.8	&#145;O in seven long years, I&#146;ll make a vow
	For seven long years, and keep it strong,
	That if you&#146;ll wed no other woman,
	O I will wed no other man.&#146;
53L.9	O she took him to her father&#146;s harbor,
	And gave to him a ship of fame,
	Saying, Farewell, farewell to you, Lord Bateman,
	I fear I never shall see you again.
53L.10	Now seven long years is gone and past,
	And fourteen days, well known to me;
	She packed up all her gay clothing,
	And swore Lord Bateman she would go see.
53L.11	O when she arrived at Lord Bateman&#146;s castle,
	How boldly then she rang the bell!
	&#145;Who&#146;s there? who&#146;s there?&#146; cries the proud young porter,
	&#145;O come unto me pray quickly tell.&#146;
53L.12	&#145;O is this here Lord Bateman&#146;s castle,
	And is his lordship here within?&#146;
	&#145;O yes, O yes,&#146; cries the proud young porter,
	&#145;He&#146;s just now taking his young bride in.&#146;
53L.13	&#145;O bid him to send me a slice of bread,
	And a bottle of the very best wine,
	And not forgetting the fair young lady
	As did release him when close confine.&#146;
53L.14	O away and away went this proud young porter,
	O away and away and away went he,
	Until he come to Lord Bateman&#146;s chamber,
	When he went down on his bended knee.
53L.15	&#145;What news, what news, my proud young porter?
	What news, what news? Come tell to me:&#146;
	&#145;O there is the fairest young lady
	As ever my two eyes did see.
53L.16	&#145;She has got rings on every finger,
	And on one finger she has got three;
	With as much gay gold about her middle
	As would buy half Northumberlee.
53L.17	&#145;O she bids you to send her a slice of bread,
	And a bottle of the very best wine,
	And not forgetting the fair young lady
	As did release you when close confine.&#146;
53L.18	Lord Bateman then in passion flew,
	And broke his sword in splinters three,
	Saying, I will give half of my father&#146;s land,
	If so be as Sophia has crossed the sea.
53L.19	Then up and spoke this young bride&#146;s mother,
	Who never was heard to speak so free;
	Saying, You&#146;ll not forget my only daughter,
	If so be as Sophia has crossed the sea.
53L.20	&#145;O it&#146;s true I made a bride of your daughter,
	But she&#146;s neither the better nor the worse for me;
	She came to me with a horse and saddle,
	But she may go home in a coach and three.&#146;
53L.21	Lord Bateman then prepared another marriage,
	With both their hearts so full of glee,
	Saying, I will roam no more to foreign countries,
	Now that Sophia has crossed the sea.

	And she is to the jail-house door,
	To hear Young Bondwell&#146;s sang.
53M.7	&#145;Sing on, sing on, my bonny Bondwell,

	Where under the bed they lay;
	She&#146;s opend to him the jail-house door,
	And set Young Bondwell free.

	To keep him onthought lang.
53M.14	When mony days were past and gane,
	Dame Essels thought fell lang,
	And she is to her lonely bower,
	To shorten her wi a sang.
53M.15	The sang has such a melody,
	It lulld her fast asleep;
	Up starts a woman, clad in green,
	And stood at her bed-feet.
53M.16	&#145;Win up, win up, Dame Essels,&#146; she says,
	&#145;This day ye sleep ower lang;
	The morn is the squire&#146;s wedding day,
	In the bonny towers o Linne.
53M.17	&#145;Ye&#146;ll dress yoursell in the robes o green,
	Your maids in robes sae fair,
	And ye&#146;ll put girdles about their middles,
	Sae costly, rich and rare.
53M.18	&#145;Ye&#146;ll take your maries alang wi you,
	Till ye come to yon strand;
	There ye&#146;ll see a ship, wi sails all up,
	Come sailing to dry land.
53M.19	&#145;Ye&#146;ll take a wand into your hand,
	Ye&#146;ll stroke her round about,
	And ye&#146;ll take God your pilot to be,
	To drown ye&#146;ll take nae doubt.&#146;
53M.20	Then up it raise her Dame Essels,
	Sought water to wash her hands,
	But aye the faster that she washd,
	The tears they trickling ran.
53M.21	Then in it came her father dear,
	And in the floor steps he:
	&#145;What ails Dame Essels, my daughter dear,
	Ye weep sae bitterlie?
53M.22	&#145;Want ye a small fish frae the flood,
	Or turtle frae the sea?
	Or is there man in a&#146; my realm

53M.23	&#145;I want nae small fish frae the flood,
	Nor turtle frae the sea;

	This day has offended me.&#146;
53M.24	Her father turnd him round about,
	A solemn oath sware he:
	&#145;If this be true ye tell me now
	High hanged he shall be.
53M.25	&#145;To-morrow morning he shall be
	Hung high upon a tree:&#146;
	Dame Essels whisperd to hersel,

53M.26	She dressd hersel in robes o green,

53M.44	Is this the way ye keep your vows
	That ye did make to me,

	Ae foot ye coudna flee?
53M.45	I stole the keys o the jail-house door

53N.1	IN London was Young Bichen born,
	He longd strange lands to see;
	He set his foot on good ship-board,
	And he sailed over the sea.
53N.2	He had not been in a foreign land
	A day but only three,
	Till he was taken by a savage Moor,
	And they used him most cruelly.
53N.3	In every shoulder they put a pin,
	To every pin they put a tree;
	They made him draw the plow and cart,
	Like horse and oxen in his country.
53N.4	He had not servd the savage Moor
	A week, nay scarcely but only three,
	Till he has casten him in prison strong,
	Till he with hunger was like to die.
53N.5	It fell out once upon a day
	That Young Bichen he made his moan,
	As he lay bound in irons strong,
	In a dark and deep dungeon.
53N.6	&#145;An I were again in fair England,
	As many merry day I have been,
	Then I would curb my roving youth
	No more to see a strange land.
53N.7	&#145;O an I were free again now,
	And my feet well set on the sea,
	I would live in peace in my own country,
	And a foreign land I no more would see.&#146;
53N.8	The savage Moor had but one daughter,
	I wot her name was Susan Py;
	She heard Young Bichen make his moan,
	At the prison-door as she past by.
53N.9	&#145;O have ye any lands,&#146; she said,
	&#145;Or have you any money free,
	Or have you any revenues,
	To maintain a lady like me?&#146;
53N.10	&#145;O I have land in fair England,
	And I have estates two or three,
	And likewise I have revenues,
	To maintain a lady like thee.&#146;
53N.11	&#145;O will you promise, Young Bichen,&#146; she says,
	&#145;And keep your vow faithful to me,
	That at the end of seven years
	In fair England you&#146;ll marry me?
53N.12	&#145;I&#146;ll steal the keys from my father dear,
	Tho he keeps them most secretly;
	I&#146;ll risk my life for to save thine,
	And set thee safe upon the sea.&#146;
53N.13	She&#146;s stolen the keys from her father,
	From under the bed where they lay;
	She opened the prison strong
	And set Young Bichen at liberty.
53N.14	She&#146;s gone to her father&#146;s coffer,
	Where the gold was red and fair to see;
	She filled his pockets with good red gold,
	And she set him far upon the sea.
53N.15	&#145;O mind you well, Young Bichen,&#146; she says,
	&#145;The vows and oaths you made to me;
	When you are come to your native land,
	O then remember Susan Py!&#146;
53N.16	But when her father he came home
	He missd the keys there where they lay;
	He went into the prison strong,
	But he saw Young Bichen was away.
53N.17	&#145;Go bring your daughter, madam,&#146; he says,
	&#145;And bring her here unto me;
	Altho I have no more but her,
	Tomorrow I&#146;ll gar hang her high.&#146;
53N.18	The lady calld on the maiden fair
	To come to her most speedily;
	&#145;Go up the country, my child,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Stay with my brother two years or three.
53N.19	&#145;I have a brother, he lives in the isles,
	He will keep thee most courteously
	And stay with him, my child,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Till thy father&#146;s wrath be turnd from thee.&#146;
53N.20	Now will we leave young Susan Py
	A while in her own country,
	And will return to Young Bichen,
	Who is safe arrived in fair England.
53N.21	He had not been in fair England
	Above years scarcely three,
	Till he has courted another maid,
	And so forgot his Susan Py.
53N.22	The youth being young and in his prime,
	Of Susan Py thought not upon,
	But his love was laid on another maid,
	And the marriage-day it did draw on.
53N.23	But eer the seven years were run,
	Susan Py she thought full long;
	She set her foot on good ship-board,
	And she has saild for fair England.
53N.24	On every finger she put a ring,
	On her mid-finger she put three;
	She filld her pockets with good red gold,
	And she has sailed oer the sea.
53N.25	She had not been in fair England
	A day, a day, but only three,
	Till she heard Young Bichen was a bridegroom,
	And the morrow to be the wedding-day.
53N.26	&#145;Since it is so,&#146; said young Susan,
	&#145;That he has provd so false to me,
	I&#146;ll hie me to Young Bichen&#146;s gates,
	And see if he minds Susan Py.&#146;
53N.27	She has gone up thro London town,
	Where many a lady she there did spy;
	There was not a lady in all London
	Young Susan that could outvie.
53N.28	She has calld upon a waiting-man,
	A waiting-man who stood near by:
	&#145;Convey me to Young Bichen&#146;s gates,
	And well rewarded shals thou be.&#146;
53N.29	When she came to Young Bichen&#146;s gate
	She chapped loudly at the pin,
	Till down there came the proud porter;
	&#145;Who&#146;s there,&#146; he says, &#146;That would be in?&#146;
53N.30	&#145;Open the gates, porter,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Open them to a lady gay,
	And tell your master, porter,&#146; she says,
	&#145;To speak a word or two with me.&#146;
53N.31	The porter he has opend the gates;
	His eyes were dazzled to see
	A lady dressd in gold and jewels;
	No page nor waiting-man had she.
53N.32	&#145;O pardon me, madam,&#146; he cried,
	&#145;This day it is his wedding-day;
	He&#146;s up the stairs with his lovely bride,
	And a sight of him you cannot see.&#146;
53N.33	She put her hand in her pocket,
	And therefrom took out guineas three,
	And gave to him, saying, Please, kind sir,
	Bring down your master straight to me.
53N.34	The porter up again has gone,
	And he fell low down on his knee,
	Saying, Master, you will please come down
	To a lady who wants you to see.
53N.35	A lady gay stands at your gates,
	The like of her I neer did see;
	She has more gold above her eye
	Nor would buy a baron&#146;s land to me.
53N.36	Out then spake the bride&#146;s mother,
	I&#146;m sure an angry woman was she:
	&#145;You&#146;re impudent and insolent,
	For ye might excepted the bride and me.&#146;
53N.37	&#145;Ye lie, ye lie, ye proud woman,
	I&#146;m sure sae loud as I hear you lie;
	She has more gold on her body
	Than would buy the lands, the bride, and thee!&#146;
53N.38	&#145;Go down, go down, porter,&#146; he says,
	&#145;And tell the lady gay from me
	That I&#146;m up-stairs wi my lovely bride,
	And a sight of her I cannot see.&#146;
53N.39	The porter he goes down again,
	The lady waited patiently:
	&#145;My master&#146;s with his lovely bride,
	And he&#146;ll not win down my dame to see.&#146;
53N.40	From off her finger she&#146;s taen a ring;
	&#145;Give that your master,&#146; she says, &#146;From me,
	And tell him now, young man,&#146; she says,
	&#145;To send down a cup of wine to me.&#146;
53N.41	&#145;Here&#146;s ring for you, master,&#146; he says,
	&#145;On her mid-finger she has three,
	And you are desird, my lord,&#146; he says,
	&#145;To send down a cup of wine with me.&#146;
53N.42	He hit the table with his foot,
	He kepd it with his right knee:
	&#145;I&#146;ll wed my life and all my land
	That is Susan Py, come o&#146;er the sea!&#146;
53N.43	He has gone unto the stair-head,
	A step he took but barely three;
	He opend the gates most speedily,
	And Susan Py he there could see.
53N.44	&#145;Is this the way, Young Bichen,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Is this the way you&#146;ve guided me?
	I relieved you from prison strong,
	And ill have you rewarded me.
53N.45	mind ye, Young Bichen,&#146; she says,
	&#145;The vows and oaths that ye made to me,
	When ye lay bound in prison strong,
	In a deep dungeon of misery?&#146;
53N.46	He took her by the milk-white hand,
	And led her into the palace fine;
	There was not a lady in all the palace
	But Susan Py did all outshine.
53N.47	The day concluded with joy and mirth,
	On every side there might you see;
	There was great joy in all England
	For the wedding-day of Susan Py.
