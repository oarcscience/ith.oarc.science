	 For he shod his steed wi siller guid,
	 And he&#146;s playd the ranting laddie.
241B.2	 He hadna been in fair London
	 A twalmonth and a quarter,
	 Till he met wi a weel-faurd may,
	 Wha wishd to know how they ca&#146;d him.
241B.3	 &#145;They ca me this, and they ca me that,
	 And they&#146;re easy how they&#146;ve ca&#146;d me;

241B.4	 &#145;Awa wi your jesting, sir,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;I trow you&#146;re a ranting laddie;
	 But something swells atween my sides,

241C.1	 THE Baron o Leys to France is gane,
	 The fashion and tongue to learn,
	 But hadna been there a month or twa
	 Till he gat a lady wi bairn.
241C.2	 But it fell ance upon a day
	 The lady mournd fu sairlie;
	 Says, Who&#146;s the man has me betrayed?
	 It gars me wonder and fairlie.
241C.3	 Then to the fields to him she went,
	 Saying, Tell me what they ca thee;
	 Or else I&#146;ll mourn and rue the day,
	 Crying, alas that ever I saw thee!
241C.4	 &#145;Some ca&#146;s me this, some ca&#146;s me that,
	 I carena fat befa me;
	 For when I&#146;m at the schools o France
	 An awkward fellow they ca me.&#146;
241C.5	 &#145;Wae&#146;s me now, ye awkward fellow,
	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
	 Wi you I&#146;m in love, sick, sick in love,
	 And I kenna well fat they ca thee.&#146;
241C.6	 &#145;Some ca&#146;s me this, some ca&#146;s me that,
	 What name does best befa me;
	 For when I walk in Edinburgh streets
	 The Curling Buckle they ca me.&#146;
241C.7	 &#145;O wae&#146;s me now, O Curling Buckle,
	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
	 For I&#146;m in love, sick, sick in love,
	 And I kenna well fat they ca thee.&#146;
241C.8	 &#145;Some ca&#146;s me this, some ca&#146;s me that,
	 Whatever name best befa&#146;s me;
	 But when I&#146;m in Scotland&#146;s king&#146;s high court
	 Clatter the Speens they ca me.&#146;
241C.9	 &#145;O wae&#146;s me now, O Clatter the Speens,
	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
	 For I&#146;m in love, sick, sick in love,
	 And I kenna well fat to ca thee.&#146;
241C.10	 &#145;Some ca&#146;s me this, some ca&#146;s me that,
	 I carena what they ca me;
	 But when wi the Earl o Murray I ride
	 It&#146;s Scour the Brass they ca me.&#146;
241C.11	 &#145;O wae&#146;s me now, O Scour the Brass,
	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
	 For I&#146;m in love, sick, sick in love,
	 Amd I kenna well fat to ca thee.&#146;
241C.12	 &#145;Some ca&#146;s me this, some ca&#146;s me that,
	 Whatever name best befa&#146;s me;
	 But when I walk thro Saint Johnstone&#146;s town
	 George Burnett they ca me.&#146;
241C.13	 &#145;O wae&#146;s me, O wae&#146;s me, George Burnett,
	 And alas that ever I saw thee!
	 For I&#146;m in love, sick, sick in love,
	 And I kenna well fat to ca thee.&#146;
241C.14	 &#145;Some ca&#146;s me this, some ca&#146;s me that,
	 Whatever name best befa&#146;s me;
	 But when I am on bonny Dee side
	 The Baron o Leys they ca me.&#146;
241C.15	 &#145;O weal is me now, O Baron o Leys,
	 This day that ever I saw thee!
	 There&#146;s gentle blood within my sides,
	 And now [I] ken fat they ca thee.
241C.16	 &#145;But ye&#146;ll pay down ten thousand crowns,
	 Or marry me the morn;
	 Else I&#146;ll cause you be headed or hangd
	 For gieing me the scorn.&#146;
241C.17	 &#145;My head is a thing I cannot well want;
	 My lady loves me sae dearly;
	 But I&#146;ll deal the gold right liberally
	 For lying ae night sae near thee.&#146;
241C.18	 When word had gane to the Lady o Leys
	 The baron had gotten a bairn,
	 She clapped her hands, and this did say,
	 &#145;I wish he were in my arms!
241C.19	 &#145;O weal is me now, O Baron o Leys,
	 For ye hae pleased me sairly;
	 Frae our house is banishd the vile reproach
	 That disturbed us late and early.&#146;
241C.20	 When she looked ower her castle-wa,
	 To view the woods sae rarely,
	 There she spied the Baron o Leys
	 Ride on his steed sae rarely.
241C.21	 Then forth she went her baron to meet,
	 Says, Ye&#146;re welcome to me, fairly!
	 Ye&#146;se hae spice-cakes, and seed-cakes sweet,
	 And claret to drink sae rarely.
