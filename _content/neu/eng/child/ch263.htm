<PRE>

263A.1	 MY heart is lighter than the poll;
	 My folly made me glad,
	 As on my rambles I went out,
	 Near by a garden-side.
263A.2	 I walked on, and father on,
	 Love did my heart engage;
	 There I spied a well-faird maid,
	 Lay sleeping near a hedge.
263A.3	 Then I kissd her with my lips
	 And stroked her with my hand:
	 &#145;Win up, win up, ye well-faird maid,
	 This day ye sleep oer lang.
263A.4	 &#145;This dreary sight that I hae seen
	 Unto my heart gives pain;
	 At the south side o your father&#146;s garden,
	 I see a knight lies slain.&#146;
263A.5	 &#145;O what like was his hawk, his hawk?
	 Or what like was his hound?
	 And what like was the trusty brand
	 This new-slain knight had on?&#146;
263A.6	 &#145;His hawk and hound were from him gone,
	 His steed tied to a tree;
	 A bloody brand beneath his head,
	 And on the ground lies he.&#146;
263A.7	 &#145;O what like was his hose, his hose?
	 And what like was his shoon?
	 And what like was the gay clothing
	 This new-slain knight had on?&#146;
263A.8	 &#145;His coat was of the red scarlet,
	 His waistcoat of the same;
	 His hose were of the bonny black,
	 And shoon laced with cordin.
263A.9	 &#145;Bonny was his yellow hair,
	 For it was new combd down;&#146;
	 Then, sighing sair, said the lady fair,
	 &#145;I combd it late yestreen.
263A.10	 &#145;O wha will shoe my fu fair foot?
	 Or wha will glove my hand?
	 Or wha will father my dear bairn,
	 Since my love&#146;s dead and gane?&#146;
263A.11	 &#145;O I will shoe your fu fair foot,
	 And I will glove your hand;
	 And I&#146;ll be father to your bairn,
	 Since your love&#146;s dead and gane.&#146;
263A.12	 &#145;I winna father my bairn,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Upon an unkent man;
	 I&#146;ll father it on the King of Heaven,
	 Since my love&#146;s dead and gane.&#146;
263A.13	 The knight he knackd his white fingers,
	 The lady tore her hair;
	 He&#146;s drawn the mask from off his face,
	 Says, Lady, mourn nae mair.
263A.14	 &#145;For ye are mine, and I am thine,
	 I see your love is true;
	 And if I live and brook my life
	 Ye&#146;se never hae cause to rue.&#146;
