<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">287A: Captain Ward and the Rainbow</H1>
<PRE>

287A.1	 STRIKE up, you lusty gallants, with musick and sound of drum,
	 For we have descryed a rover, upon the sea is come;
	 His name is Captain Ward, right well it doth appear,
	 There has not been such a rover found out this thousand year.
287A.2	 For he hath sent unto our king, the sixth of January,
	 Desiring that he might come in, with all his company:
	 &#145;And if your king will let me come till I my tale have told,
	 I will bestow for my ransome full thirty tun of gold.&#146;
287A.3	 &#145;O nay! O nay!&#146; then said our king, &#145;O nay! this may not be,
	 To yield to such a rover my self will not agree;
	 He hath deceivd the French-man, likewise the King of Spain,
	 And how can he be true to me that hath been false to twain?&#146;
287A.4	 With that our king provided a ship of worthy fame,
	 Rainbow she is called, if you would know her name;
	 Now the gallant Rainbow she rowes upon the sea,
	 Five hundred gallant seamen to bear her company.
287A.5	 The Dutch-man and the Spaniard she made them for to flye,
	 Also the bonny French-man, as she met him on the sea:
	 When as this gallant Rainbow did come where Ward did lye,
	 &#145;Where is the captain of this ship?&#146; this gallant Rainbow did cry.
287A.6	 &#145;O that am I,&#146; says Captain Ward, &#146;There&#146;s no man bids me lye,
	 And if thou art the king&#146;s fair ship, thou art welcome unto me:&#146;
	 &#145;I&#146;le tell thee what,&#146; says Rainbow, &#146;our king is in great grief
	 That thou shouldst lye upon the sea and play the arrant thief,
287A.7	 &#145;And will not let our merchants ships pass as they did before;
	 Such tydings to our king is come, which grieves his heart full sore.&#146;
	 With that this gallant Rainbow she shot, out of her pride,
	 Full fifty gallant brass pieces, charged on every side.
287A.8	 And yet these gallant shooters prevailed not a pin,
	 Though they were brass on the out-side, brave Ward was steel within;
	 &#145;Shoot on, shoot on,&#146; says Captain Ward, &#146;your sport well pleaseth me,
	 And he that first gives over shall yield unto the sea.
287A.9	 &#145;I never wrongd an English ship, but Turk and King of Spain,
	 For and the jovial Dutch-man as I met on the main.
	 If I had known your king but one two years before,
	 I would have savd brave Essex life, whose death did grieve me sore.
287A.10	 &#145;Go tell the King of England, go tell him thus from me,
	 If he reign king of all the land, I will reign king at sea.&#146;
	 With that the gallant Rainbow shot, and shot, and shot in vain,
	 And left the rover&#146;s company, and returnd home again.
287A.11	 &#145;Our royal king of England, your ship&#146;s returned again,
	 For Ward&#146;s ship is so strong it never will be tane:&#146;
	 &#145;O everlasting!&#146; says our king, &#145;I have lost jewels three,
	 Which would have gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me.
287A.12	 &#145;The first was Lord Clifford, Earl of Cumberland;
	 The second was the lord Mountjoy, as you shall understand;
	 The third was brave Essex, from field would never flee;
	 Which would a gone unto the seas and brought proud Ward to me.&#146;
