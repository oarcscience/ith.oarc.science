    221A.1   THERE livd a lass in yonder dale,
         And doun in yonder glen, O
         And Kathrine Jaffray was her name,
         Well known by many men. O
    221A.2   Out came the Laird of Lauderdale,
         Out frae the South Countrie,
         All for to court this pretty maid,
         Her bridegroom for to be.
    221A.3   He has teld her father and mither baith,
         And a the rest o her kin,
         And has teld the lass hersell,

         Well mounted in good order.
    221A.5   Hes teld her father and mither baith,
         As I hear sindry say,
         But he has nae teld the lass her sell,
         Till on her wedding day.
    221A.6   When day was set, and friends were met,
         And married to be,
         Lord Lauderdale came to the place,
         The bridal for to see.
    221A.7   O are you came for sport, young man?
         Or are you come for play?
         Or are you come for a sight o our bride,
         Just on her wedding day?
    221A.8   Im nouther come for sport, he says,
         Nor am I come for play;
         But if I had one sight o your bride,
         Ill mount and ride away.
    221A.9   There was a glass of the red wine
         Filld up them atween,
         And ay she drank to Lauderdale,
         Wha her true-love had been.
    221A.10  Then he took her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the grass-green sleeve,
         And he mounted her high behind him there,
         At the bridegroom he askt nae leive.
    221A.11  Then the blude run down by the Cowden Banks,
         And down by Cowden Braes,
         And ay she gard the trumpet sound,
         O this is foul, foul play!
    221A.12  Now a ye that in England are,
         Or are in England born,

         Till on your wedding day,
         And gie ye frogs instead o fish,
         And play ye foul, foul play.

         Beheld baith dool and doon,
         And there he spied her first fere love,
         Come riding to the toun.
    221B.6   She scoffed and she scorned him,
         Upo the wedding-day,
         And said it had been the Fairy Court
         That he had seen in array.

         . . . .
         . . .

         Or came you here to flee?
         Or cam you here to drink good wine,
         And be good company?
    221B.11  They filled a cup o good red wine,
         Drunk out between them twa:
         For one dance wi your bonny bride,
         I shall gae hame my wa.
    221B.12  Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the grass-green sleeve,

         And the chief of all her kin,
         But still he askd the lass hersell,

    221D.4   At length the Laird of Lachenware
         Came from the English border,
         And for to court this bonnie bride,
         Was mounted in good order.
    221D.5   He asked at her father, sae did he at her mother,
         As I heard many say,
         But he never loot the lassie wit
         Till on her wedding-day.

         And ay she drank to Lamington,
         Her former love whod been.

         Or came you for a sight of my bonnie bride,
         Upon her wedding-day?
    221D.14  I came not here for sport, he says,
         Nor came I here for play;
         But an I had ae word of your bride,
         Ill horse and gae my way.
    221D.15  The first time that he calld on her,
         Her answer was him Nay;
         But the next time that he calld on her,
         She was not slow to gae.
    221D.16  He took her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the grass-green sleeve,
         Hes pulld her on behind him,
         At the bridegroom speard nae leave.
    221D.17  The blood ran up the caden bank,
         And down the Caden brae,
         And ay she bade the trumpet sound
         Its a for foul, foul play.
    221D.18  I wonder o you English squires,
         That are in England born,
         That ye come to court our Scots lasses,
         For fear ye get the scorn.
    221D.19  For fear you get the scorn, she says,
         Upon your wedding-day;
         Theyll gee you frogs instead of fish,
         And take your bride away.

         And drunken atween the twa;
         And one glass wi your bonny bride,
         And Ise go boun away.
    221F.17  Her maiden she stood forbye,
         And quickly she said, Nay
         I winna gee a word o her
         To none nor yet to thee.
    221F.18  Oh, one word o yer bonny bride!
         Will ye refuse me one?
         Before her wedding-day was set,
         I would hae gotten ten.
    221F.19  Take here my promise, maiden,
         My promise and my hand,
         Out oer her fathers gates this day
         Wi me she shanna gang.
    221F.20  Hes bent him oer his saddle-bow,
         To kiss her ere he gaed,
         And he fastened his hand in her gown-breast,
         And tust her him behind.
    221F.21  He pat the spurs into his horse
         And fast rade out at the gate;
         Ye wouldna hae seen his yellow locks
         For the dust o his horse feet.
    221F.22  Fast has he ridden the wan water,
         And merrily taen the know.
         And then the battle it began;
         Ime sure it was na mow.
    221F.23  Bridles brack, and weight horse lap,
         And blades flain in the skies,
         And wan and drousie was the blood
         Gaed lapperin down the lays.
    221F.24  Now all ye English lords,
         In England where yer borne,
         Come never to Scotland to woo a bride,
         For theyle gie you the scorn.
    221F.25  For theyle gie you the scorn,
         The scorn, if that they may;
         Theyll gie you frogs instead of fish,
         And steal your bride away.

### 221G: Katherine Jafray


    221G.1   O BONNY Catharine Jaffery,
         That dainty maid so fair,
         Once lovd the laird of Lochinvar,
         Without any compare.
    221G.2   Long time she lood him very well,
         But they changed her mind away,
         And now she goes anothers bride,
         And plays him foul play.
    221G.3   The bonny laird of Lauderdale
         Came from the South Countrie,
         And he has wooed the pretty maid,
         Thro presents entered he.
    221G.4   For tocher-gear he did not stand,
         She was a dainty may;
         He greed him with her friends all,
         And set the wedding-day.
    221G.5   When Lochinvar got word o this,
         He knew not what to do,
         For losing of a lady fair
         That he did love so true.
    221G.6   But if I were young Lochinvar,
         I woud not care a fly
         To take her on her wedding-day
         From all her company.
    221G.7   Get ye a quiet messenger,
         Send him thro all your land
         For a hundred and fifty brave young lads,
         To be at your command.
    221G.8   To be all at your command,
         And your bidding to obey,
         Yet still cause you the trumpet sound
         The voice of foul play.
    221G.9   He got a quiet messenger
         To send thro all his land,
         And full three hundred pretty lads
         Were all at his command.
    221G.10  Were all at his command,
         And his bidding did obey,
         Yet still he made the trumpet sound
         The voice of foul play.
    221G.11  Then he went to the bridal-house,
         Among the nobles a,
         And when he stepped upon the floor
         He gave a loud huzza.
    221G.12  Huzza! huzza! you English men,
         Or borderers who were born,
         Neer come to Scotland for a maid,
         Or else they will you scorn.
    221G.13  Shell bring you on with tempting words,
         Aye till the wedding-day,
         Syne give you frogs instead of fish,
         And play you foul play.
    221G.14  The gentlemen all wondered
         What could be in his mind,
         And asked if hed a mind to fight;
         Why spoke he so unkind?
    221G.15  Did he eer see such pretty men
         As were there in array?
         O yes, said he, a+e Fairy Court
         Were leaping on the hay.
    221G.16  As I came in by Hyland banks,
         And in by Hyland braes,
         There did I see a Fairy Court,
         All leaping on the leas.
    221G.17  I came not here to fight, he said,
         But for good fellowshio gay;
         I want to drink with your bridegroom,
         And then Ill boun my way.
    221G.18  The glass was filled with good red wine,
         And drunk between them twae:
         Give me one shake of your bonny brides hand,
         And then Ill boun my way.
    221G.19  Hes taen her by the milk-white hands,
         And by the grass-green sleeve,
         Pulld her on horseback him behind,
         At her friends askd nae leave.
    221G.20  Syne rode the water with great speed,
         And merrily the knows;
         There fifty from the bridal came-+--+-
         Indeed it was nae mows-+--+-
    221G.21  Thinking to take the bride again,
         Thro strangth if that they may;
         But still he gart the trumpet sound
         The voice of foul play.
    221G.22  There were four and twenty ladies fair
         All walking on the lea;
         He gave to them the bonny bride,
         And bade them boun their way.
    221G.23  They splintered the spears in pieces now,
         And the blades flew in the sky,
         But the bonny laird of Lochinvar
         Has gained the victory.
    221G.24  Many a wife- and widows son
         Lay gasping on the ground,
         But the bonny laird of Lochinvar
         He has the victory won.

### 221H: Katherine Jafray


    221H.1   THERE was a lady fair, fair,
         Lived low down in yon glen, O
         And shes been courted far an near
         By several gentlemen.  O
    221H.2   At length the laird of Lammington
         Came frae the West Country,
         All to court that pretty girl,
         And her bridegroom for to be.
    221H.3   He told her father, so did he her mother,
         And all the rest of her kin,
         And he has told the lass hersel,
         And her kind favour has won.
    221H.4   At length the laird of Laughenwaur
         Came frae the English border,
         And all to court that pretty girl,
         Well mounted in good order.
    221H.5   He told her father, so did he her mother,
         As I heard people say,
         But he ner told the lass hersel,
         Till on her wedding-day.
    221H.6   But when the wedding-day was fixed,
         And married for to be,
         Then Lamington came to the town,
         The bridegroom for to see.
    221H.7   O are ye come for sport, sir?  he said,
         Or are ye come for play?
         Or are ye for a sight o my bonny bride,
         Upon her wedding-day?
    221H.8   Am neither come for sport, sir, he said,
         Nor am I come for play,
         But if I had one word o the bride
         Id mount and go away.
    221H.9   There was a cup of the good red wine
         Was filled out them between,
         And aye she drank to Lammington,
         Who her true-love had been.
    221H.10  Hes taen her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the grass-green sleeve;
         Hes mounted her behind him then,
         At the bridegroom speered no leave.
    221H.11  The blood ran down by Cowden banks,
         And down by Cowden brae,
         And aye they gaured the piper play
         It was a foul, foul play.
    221H.12  Ye gentlemen of Lochenwaur,
         Thats laigh in England born,
         Come ner to Scotland to court a wife,
         Or be sure yel get the scorn.
    221H.13  Thell keep ye up, and tamper ye at,
         Until yer wedding-day,
         And theyl gie ye frogs instead o fish,
         And theyll play ye a foul play.

### 221I: Katherine Jafray


    221I.1   IN Bordershellin there did dwell
         A comely, handsome may,
         And Lochinvar he courted her,
         And stole her heart away.
    221I.2   She loved him but owre weel,
         And his love drew away;
         Another man then courted her,
         And set the wedding-day,
    221I.3   They set the wedding-day so plain,
         As plain as it might be;
         She sent a letter to her former love,
         The wedding to come see.
    221I.4   When Lochinvar the letter read,
         He sent owre a his land
         For four and twenty beltit knichts,
         To come at his command.
    221I.5   They all came to his hand, I say,
         Upon that wedding-day;
         He set them upon milk-white steeds,
         And put them in array.
    221I.6   He set them in array, I say,
         Most pleasant to be seen,
         And hes awa to the wedding-house,
         A single man his lane.
    221I.7   And when he was to the wedding-house come,
         They wee all sitten down;
         Baith gentlemen and knichts was there,
         And lords of high renown.
    221I.8   They saluted him, baith auld and young,
         Speired how he had spent the day,
         And what young Lankashires was yon
         They saw all in array.
    221I.9   But he answerd them richt scornfullie,
         Upon their wedding-day;
         He says, Its been some Fairy Court
         Yeve seen all in array.
    221I.10  Then rose up the young bridegroom,
         And an angry man was he:
         Lo, art thou come to fight, young man?
         Indeed Ill fight wi thee.
    221I.11  O I am not come to fight, he sayd,
         But good fellowship to hae,
         And for to drink the wine sae red,
         And then Ill go away.
    221I.12  Then they filld him up a brimming glass,
         And drank it between them twa:
         Now one word of your bonnie bride,
         And then Ill go my wa.
    221I.13  But some were friends, and some were faes,
         Yet nane o them was free
         To let the bride on her wedding-day
         Gang out o their companie.
    221I.14  But he took her by the milk-white hand,
         And by the grass-green sleeve,
         And set her on a milk-white steed,
         And at nane o them speerd he leave.
    221I.15  Then the blood ran down the Caylin bank,
         And owre the Caylin brae;
         The auld folks knew something o the sport,
         Which gart them cry, Foul play!
    221I.16  Ye lusty lads of Limberdale,
         Tho ye be English born,
         Come nae mair to Scotland to court a maid,
         For fear ye get the scorn.
    221I.17  For fear that ye do get the scorn
         Upon your wedding-day;
         Least ye catch frogs instead of fish,
         And then yell cat foul play.

### 221J: Katherine Jafray


    221J.1   THERE was a lass, as I heard say,
         Lived low down in a glen;
         Her name was Catharine Johnson,
         Weel known to many men.
    221J.2   Doun cam the laird o Lamingtoun,
         Doun frae the South Countrie,
         And he is for this bonnie lass,
         Her bridegroom for to be.
    221J.3   Hes askd her father and mother,
         The chief of a her kin,
         And then he askd the bonnie lass,
         And did her favour win.
    221J.4   Doun cam an Ehglish gentleman,
         Doun frae the English border;
         He is for this bonnie lass,
         To keep his house in order.
    221J.5   He askd her father and mother,
         As I do them say,
         But he never askd the lass hersell,
         Till on her wedding-day.
    221J.6   But she has wrote a lang letter,
         And sealed it wi her hand,
         And sent it to Lord Lamington,
         To let him understand.
    221J.7   The first line o the letter he read,
         He was baith glad and fain;
         But or he read the letter owre
         He was baith pale and wan.
    221J.8   Then he has sent a messenger,
         And out through all his land,
         And four-and-twenty armed men
         Was all at his command.
    221J.9   But he has left his merry men,
         Left them on the lea;
         And hes awa to the wedding-house,
         To see what he could see.
    221J.10  But when he came to the wedding-house,
         As I do understand,
         There were four-and-twenty belted knights
         Sat at a table round.
    221J.11  They rose all for to honour him,
         For he was of high renown;
         They rose all for to welcome him,
         And bade him to sit doun.
    221J.12  O meikle was the good red wine
         In silver cups did flow,
         But aye she drank to Lamingtoun,
         For with him would she go.
    221J.13  O meikle was the good red wine
         In silver cups gaed round,
         At length they began to whisper words,
         None could them understand.
    221J.14  O came ye here for sport, young man?
         Or cam ye here for play?
         Or cam ye for our bonnie bride,
         On this her wedding-day?
    221J.15  I came not here for sport, he said,
         Neither did I for play;
         But for one word o your bonnie bride
         Ill mount and ride away.
    221J.16  They set her maids behind her,
         To hear what they would say,
         But the first question he askd at her
         Was always [answered] nay;
         The next question he askd at her
         Was, Mount and come away.
    221J.17  Its up the Couden bank,
         And doun the Couden brae;
         And aye she made the trumpet sound,
         Its a weel won play.
    221J.18  O meikle was the blood was shed
         Upon the Couden brae;
         And aye she made the trumpet sound,
         Its a fair play.
    221J.19  Come, all ye English gentlemen,
         That is of England born,
         Come nae doun to Scotland,
         For fear ye get the scorn.
    221J.20  Theyll feed ye up wi flattering words,
         And thats fair play;
         And theyll dress ye frogs instead o fish,
         Just on your wedding-day.

    221K.1   THERE lives a lass in yonder dale,

         Her name it is Catherine Jeffrey,
         She is loved by mony a ane.
    221K.2   Lord Lochinvar has courted her
         These twelve months and a day;
         With flattering words and fair speeches
         He has stown her heart away.
    221K.3   There came a knight from south sea-bank,

         And she was not sweer to draw.
    221K.21  He has taen her by the milk-white hand,
         And by her silken sleeve,
         He has mounted her high him behind,
         He spiered nae mair their leave.
    221K.22  And aye she scoffed and scorned them,
         And aye she rode away,
         And aye she gart the trumpet sound
         The voice of foul play,
         To take the bride frae her bridegroom
         Upon her wedding-day.
    221K.23  As they came in by Foudlin dyke,
         And in by Foudlin stane,
         There were mony gallant Englishmen
         Lay gasping on the green.
    221K.24  Now a you that are English lords,
         And are in England born,
         Come never here to court your brides,
         For fear ye get the scorn.
    221K.25  For aye theyll scoff and scorn you,
         And aye theyll ride away;
         Theyll gie you frogs instead of fish,
         And call it foul play.

### 221L: Katherine Jafray


    221L.1   THEY ask d him and speir d him,
         And unto him did say,
         O saw ye ocht o an armed band,
         As ye cam on your way?
    221L.2   He jested them and jeer d them,
         And thus to them did say,
         O I saw nocht but a fairy troop,
         As I rode on my way.
