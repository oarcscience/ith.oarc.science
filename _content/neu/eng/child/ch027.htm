<PRE>

27.1	SEVEN lang years I hae served the king,
      Refrain:	Fa fa fa fa lilly
	And I never got a sight of his daughter but ane.
      Refrain:	With my glimpy, glimpy, glimpy eedle,
	Lillum too tee a ta too a tee a ta a tally
27.2	I saw her thro a whummil bore,
	And I neer got a sight of her no more.
27.3	Twa was putting on her gown,
	And ten was putting pins therein.
27.4	Twa was putting on her shoon,
	And twa was buckling them again.
27.5	Five was combing down her hair,
	And I never got a sight of her nae mair.
27.6	Her neck and breast was like the snow,
	Then from the bore I was forced to go.
