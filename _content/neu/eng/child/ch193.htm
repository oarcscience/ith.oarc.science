<PRE>

193A.1	 THE Liddesdale  Crosiers hae ridden a race,
	 And they had far better staid at hame,
	 For they have lost a gallant gay,
	 Young Whinton Crosier it was his name.
193A.2	 For Parcy Reed he has him taen,
	 And he&#146;s delivered him to law,
	 But auld Crosier has made answer
	 That he&#146;ll gar the house of the Troughend fa.
193A.3	 So as it happened on a day
	 That Parcy Reed is a hunting gane,
	 And the three false Halls of Girsonsfield
	 They all along with him are gane.
193A.4	 They hunted up and they hunted down,
	 They hunted all Reedwater round,
	 Till weariness has on him siezed;
	 At the Batinghope he&#146;s fallen asleep.
193A.5	 O some they stole his powder-horn,
	 And some put water in his lang gun:
	 &#145;O waken, waken, Parcy Reed!
	 For we do doubt thou sleeps too sound.
193A.6	 &#145;O waken, O waken, Parcy Reed!
	 For we do doubt thou sleeps too long;
	 For yonder&#146;s the five Crosiers coming,
	 They&#146;re coming by the Hingin Stane.
193A.7	 &#145;If they be five men, we are four,
	 If ye will all stand true to me;
	 Now every one of you may take one,
	 And two of them ye may leave to me.&#146;
193A.8	 &#145;We will not stay, nor we dare not stay,
	 O Parcy Reed, for to fight with thee;
	 For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed,
	 That they will slay both us and thee.&#146;
193A.9	 &#145;O stay, O stay, O Tommy Hall,
	 O stay, O man, and fight with me!
	 If we see the Troughend again,
	 My good black mare I will give thee.&#146;
193A.10	 &#145;I will not stay, nor I dare not stay,
	 O Parcy Reed, to fight for thee;
	 For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed,
	 That they will slay both me and thee.&#146;
193A.11	 &#145;O stay, O stay, O Johnnie Hall,
	 O stay, O man, and fight for me!
	 If I see the Troughend again,
	 Five yoke of oxen I will give thee.&#146;
193A.12	 &#145;I will not stay, nor I dare not stay,
	 O Parcy Reed, for to fight with thee;
	 For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed,
	 That they will slay both me and thee.&#146;
193A.13	 &#145;O stay, O stay, O Willie Hall,
	 O stay, O man, and fight for me!
	 If we see the Troughend again,
	 The half of my land I will give thee.&#146;
193A.14	 &#145;I will not stay, nor I dare not stay,
	 O Parcy Reed, for to fight with thee;
	 For thou wilt find, O Parcy Reed,
	 That they will slay both me and thee.&#146;
193A.15	 &#145;Now foul fa ye, ye traitors all,
	 That ever ye should in England won!
	 You have left me in a fair field standin,
	 And in my hand an uncharged gun.
193A.16	 &#145;O fare thee well, my wedded wife!
	 O fare you well, my children five!
	 And fare thee well, my daughter Jane,
	 That I love best that&#146;s born alive!
193A.17	 &#145;O fare thee well, my brother Tom!
	 And fare you well his children five!
	 If you had been with me this day,
	 I surely had been man alive.
193A.18	 &#145;Farewell all friends! as for my foes,
	 To distant lands may they be tane,
	 And the three false Halls of Girsonsfield,
	 They&#146;ll never be trusted nor trowed again.&#146;

<PRE>

193B.1	 GOD send the land deliverance
	 Frae every reaving, riding Scot;
	 We&#146;ll sune hae neither cow nor ewe,
	 We&#146;ll sune hae neither staig nor stot.
193B.2	 The outlaws come fare Liddesdale,
	 They herry Redesdale far and near;
	 The rich man&#146;s gelding it maun gang,
	 They canna pass the puir man&#146;s mear.
193B.3	 Sure it were weel, had ilka thief
	 Around his neck a halter strang;
	 And curses heavy may they light
	 On traitors vile oursels amang.
193B.4	 Now  Parcy Reed has Crosier taen,
	 He has delivered him to the law;
	 But Crosier says he&#146;ll do waur than that,
	 He&#146;ll make the tower o Troughend fa.
193B.5	 And Crosier says he will do waur,
	 He will do waur if waur can be;
	 He&#146;ll make the bairns a&#146; fatherless,
	 And then, the land it may lie lee.
193B.6	 &#145;To the hunting, ho!&#146; cried Parcy Reed,
	 &#145;The morning sun is on the dew;
	 The cauler breeze frae off the fells
	 Will lead the dogs to the quarry true.
193B.7	 &#145;To the hunting, ho!&#146; cried Parcy Reed,
	 And to the hunting he has gane;
	 And the three fause Ha&#146;s o Girsonsfield
	 Alang wi him he has them taen.
193B.8	 They hunted high, they hunted low,
	 By heathery hill and birken shaw;
	 They raised a buck on Rooken Edge,
	 And blew the mort at fair Ealylawe.
193B.9	 They hunted high, they hunted low,
	 They made the echoes ring amain;
	 With music sweet o horn  and hound,
	 They merry made fair Redesdale glen.
193B.10	 They hunted high, they hunted low,
	 They hunted up, they hunted down,
	 Until the day was past the prime,
	 And it grew late in the afternoon.
193B.11	 They hunted high in Batinghope,
	 When as the sun was sinking low;
	 Says Parcy then, Ca off the dogs,
	 We&#146;ll bait our steeds and homeward go.
193B.12	 They lighted high in Batinghope,
	 Atween the brown and benty ground;
	 They had but rested a little while
	 Till Parcy Reed was sleeping sound.
193B.13	 There&#146;s nane may lean on a rotten staff,
	 But him that risks to get a fa;
	 There&#146;s nane may in a traitor trust,
	 And traitors black were every Ha.
193B.14	 They&#146;ve stown the bridle off his steed,
	 And they&#146;ve put water in his lang gun;
	 Theya&#146;ve fixed his sword within the sheath
	 That out again it winna come.
193B.15	 &#145;Awaken ye, waken ye, Parcy Reed,
	 Or by your enemies be taen;
	 For yonder are the five Crosiers
	 A-coming owre the Hingin-stane.&#146;
193B.16	 &#145;If they be five, and we be four,
	 Sae that ye stand alang wi me,
	 Then every man ye will take one,
	 And only leave but two to me:
	 We will them meet as brave men ought,
	 And make them either fight or flee.&#146;
193B.17	 &#145;We mayna stand, we canna stand,
	 We daurna stand alang wi thee;
	 The Crosiers haud thee at a feud,
	 And they wad kill baith thee and we.&#146;
193B.18	 &#145;O turn thee, turn thee, Johnie Ha,
	 O turn thee, man, and fight wi me;
	 When ye come to Troughend again,
	 My gude black naig I will gie thee;
	 He cost full twenty pound o gowd,
	 Atween my brother John and me.&#146;
193B.19	 &#145;I mayna turn, I canna turn,
	 I daurna turn and fight wi thee;
	 The Crosiers haud thee at a feud,
	 And they wad kill baith thee and me.&#146;
193B.20	 &#145;O turn thee, turn thee, Willie Ha,
	 O turn thee, man, and fight wi me;
	 When ye come to Troughend again,
	 A yoke o owsen I&#146;ll gie thee.&#146;
193B.21	 &#145;I mayna turn, I canna turn,
	 I daurna turn and fight wi thee;
	 The Crosiers haud thee at a feud,
	 And they wad kill baith thee and me.&#146;
193B.22	 &#145;O turn thee, turn thee, Tommy Ha,
	 O turn now, man, and fight wi me;
	 If ever we come to Troughend again,
	 My daughter Jean I&#146;ll gie to thee.&#146;
193B.23	 &#145;I mayna turn, I canna turn,
	 I daurna turn and fight wi thee;
	 The Crosiers haud thee at a feud,
	 And they wad kill baith thee and me.&#146;
193B.24	 &#145;O shame upon ye, traitors a&#146;!
	 I wish your hames ye may never see;
	 Ye&#146;ve stown the bridle off my naig,
	 And I can neither fight nor flee.
193B.25	 &#145;Ye&#146;ve stown the bridle off my naig,
	 And ye&#146;ve put water i my lnag gun;
	 Ye&#146;ve fixed my sword within the sheath
	 That out again it winna come.&#146;
193B.26	 He had but time to cross himsel,
	 A prayer he hadna time to say,
	 Till round him came the Crosiers keen,
	 All riding graithed and in array.
193B.27	 &#145;Weel met, weel met, now, Parcy Reed,
	 Thou art the very man we sought;
	 Owre lang hae we been in your debt,
	 Now will we pay you as we ought.
193B.28	 &#145;We&#146;ll pay thee at the nearest tree,
	 Where we shall hang thee like a hound;&#146;
	 Brave Parcy raisd his fankit sword,
	 And felld the foremost to the ground.
193B.29	 Alake, and wae for Parcy Reed,
	 Alake, he was an unarmed man;
	 Four weapons pierced him all at once,
	 As they assailed him there and than.
193B.30	 They fell upon him all at once,
	 They mangled him most cruellie;
	 The slightest wound might caused his deid,
	 And they hae gien him thirty-three;
	 They hacket off his hands and feet,
	 And left him lying on the lee.
193B.31	 &#145;Now, Parcy Reed, we&#146;ve paid our debt,
	 Ye canna weel dispute the tale,&#146;
	 The Crosiers said, and off they rade;
	 They rade the airt o Liddesdale.
193B.32	 It was the hour o gloaming gray,
	 When herds come in frae fauld and pen;
	 A herd he saw a huntsman lie,
	 Says he, Can this be Laird Troughen?
193B.33	 &#145;There&#146;s some will ca me Parcy Reed,
	 And some will ca me Laird Troughen;
	 It&#146;s little matter what they ca me,
	 My faes hae made me ill to ken.
193B.34	 &#145;There&#146;s some will ca me Parcy Reed,
	 And speak my praise in tower and town;
	 It&#146;s little matter what they do now,
	 My life-blood rudds the heather brown.
193B.35	 &#145;There&#146;s some will ca me Parcy Reed,
	 And a&#146; my virtues say and sing;
	 I would much rather have just now
	 A draught o water frae the spring.&#146;
193B.36	 The herd flung aff his clouted shoon
	 And to the nearest fountain ran;
	 He made his bonnet serve a cup,
	 And wan the blessing o the dying man.
193B.37	 &#145;Now, honest herd, ye maun do mair,
	 Ye maun do mair, as I you tell;
	 Ye maun bear tidings to Troughend,
	 And bear likewise my last farewell.
193B.38	 &#145;A farewell to my wedded wife,
	 A farewell to my brother John,
	 Wha sits into the Troughend tower
	 Wi heart as black as any stone.
193B.39	 &#145;A farewell to my daughter Jean,
	 A farewell to my young sons five;
	 Had they been at their father&#146;s hand,
	 I had this night been man alive.
193B.40	 &#145;A farewell to my followers a&#146;,
	 And a&#146; my neighbours gude at need;
	 Bid them think how the treacherous Ha&#146;s
	 Betrayed the life o Parcy Reed.
193B.41	 &#145;The laird o Clennel bears my bow,
	 The laird o Brandon bears my brand;
	 Wheneer they ride i the Border-side,
	 They&#146;ll mind the fate o the laird Troughend.&#146;

193[B2].1	O Parcy Reed has Crozer taen,
	 And has deliverd him to the law;
	 But Crozer says he&#146;ll do warse than that,
	 For he&#146;ll gar the tower of the Troughend fa.
193[B2.2]	And Crozer says he will do warse,
	 He will do warse, if warse can be;
	 For he&#146;ll make the bairns a&#146; fatherless,
	 And then the land it may lie lea.
193[B2.3]	O Parcy Reed has ridden a raid,
	 But he had better have staid at hame;
	 For the three fause Ha&#146;s of Girsenfield
	 Alang with him he has them taen.
193[B2.4]	He&#146;s hunted up, and he&#146;s hunted down,
	 He&#146;s hunted a&#146; the water of Reed,
	 Till wearydness has on him taen,
	 I the Baitinghope he&#146;s faen asleep.
193[B2.5]	. . . . . . . .
	 . . . . . . .
	 And the fause, fause Ha&#146;s o Girsenfield,
	 They&#146;ll never be trowed nor trusted again.
193[B2.6]	They&#146;ve taen frae him his powther-bag,
	 And they&#146;ve put water i his lang gun;
	 They&#146;ve put the sword into the sheathe
	 That out again it&#146;ll never come.
193[B2.7]	&#145;Awaken ye, awaken ye, Parcy Reed,
	 For I do fear ye&#146;ve slept owre lang;
	 For yonder are the five Crozers,
	 A coming owre by the hinging-stane.&#146;
193[B2.8]	&#145;If they be five and we be four,
	 If that ye will stand true to me,
	 If every man ye will take one,
	 Ye surely will leave two to me.
193[B2.9]	&#145;O turn, O turn, O Johny Ha,
	 O turn now, man, and fight wi me;
	 If ever ye come to Troughend again,
	 A good black nag I will gie to thee;
	 He cost me twenty pounds o gowd
	 Atween my brother John and me.&#146;
193[B2.10]	&#145;I winna turn, I canna turn;
	 I darena turn and fight wi thee;
	 For they will find out Parcy Reed,
	 And then they&#146;ll kill baith thee and me.&#146;
193[B2.11]	&#145;O turn, O turn now, Willie Ha,
	 O turn, O man, and fight wi me,
	 And if ever ye come to the Troughend again
	 A yoke of owsen I will gie thee.&#146;
193[B2.12]	&#145;I winna turn, I canna turn;
	 I darena turn and fight wi thee;
	 For they will find out Parcy Reed,
	 And they will kill baith thee and me.&#146;
193[B2.13]	&#145;O turn, O turn, O Thommy Ha,
	 O turn now, man, and fight wi me;
	 If ever ye come to the Troughend again,
	 My daughter Jean I&#146;ll gie to thee.;
193[B2.14]	&#145;I winna turn, I darena turn;
	 I winna turn and fight with thee;
	 For they will find out Parcy Reed,
	 And then they&#146;ll kill baith thee and me.&#146;
193[B2.15]	&#145;O woe be to ye, traitors a&#146;!
	 I wish England ye may never win;
	 Ye&#146;ve left me in the field to stand,
	 And in my hand an uncharged gun.&#146;
193[B2.16]	&#145;Ye&#146;ve taen frae me my powther-bag,
	 And ye&#146;ve put water i my lang gun;
	 Ye&#146;ve put the sword into the sheath
	 That out again it&#146;ll never come.
193[B2.17]	&#145;O fare ye weel, my married wife!
	 And fare ye weel, my brother John!
	 That sits into the Troughend ha
	 With heart as black as any stone.
193[B2.18]	&#145;O fare ye weel, my married wife!
	 And fare ye weel now, my sons five!
	 For hae ye been wi me this day
	 I surely had been man alive.
193[B2.19]	&#145;O fare ye weel, my married wife!

	 And fare ye weel, my daughter Jean!
	 I loved ye best ye were born alive.
193[B2.20]	&#145;O some do ca me Parcy Reed,
	 And some do ca me Laird Troughend,
	 But it&#146;s nae matter what they ca me,
	 My faes have made me ill to ken.
193[B2.21]	&#145;The laird o Clennel wears my bow,
	 The laird o Brandon wears my brand;
	 Whae ever rides i the Border side
	 Will mind the liard o the Troughend.&#146;
