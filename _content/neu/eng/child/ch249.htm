<PRE>

249A.1	 MY love she is a gentlewoman,
	 Has her living by the seam;
	 I kenna how she is provided
	 This night for me and my foot-groom.
249A.2	 He is gane to Annie&#146;s bower-door,
	 And gently tirled at the pin:
	 &#145;Ye sleep, ye wake, my love Annie,
	 Ye&#146;ll rise and lat your true-love in.&#146;
249A.3	 Wi her white fingers lang and sma
	 She gently lifted up the pin;
	 Wi her arms lang and bent
	 She kindly caught sweet Willie in.
249A.4	 &#145;O will ye go to cards or dice?
	 Or will ye go to play?
	 Or will ye go to a well made bed,
	 And sleep a while till day?&#146;
249A.5	 &#145;I winna gang to cards nor dice,
	 Nor yet will I to play;
	 But I will gang to a well made bed,
	 And sleep a while till day.
249A.6	 &#145;My love Annie, my dear Annie,
	 I would be at your desire;
	 But wae mat fa the auld Matrons,
	 As she sits by the kitchen fire!&#146;
249A.7	 &#145;Keep up your heart, Willie,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Keep up your heart, dinna fear;
	 It&#146;s seven years, and some guid mair,
	 Sin her foot did file the flear.&#146;
249A.8	 They hadna kissd nor love clapped,
	 As lovers when they meet,
	 Till up it raise the auld Matrons,
	 Sae well&#146;s she spread her feet.
249A.9	 O wae mat fa the auld Matrons,
	 Sae clever&#146;s she took the gate!
	 And she&#146;s gaen ower yon lang, lang hill,
	 Knockd at the sheriff&#146;s yate.
249A.10	 &#145;Ye sleep, ye wake, my lord?&#146; she said;
	 &#145;Are ye not your bower within?
	 There&#146;s knight in bed wi your daughter,
	 I fear she&#146;s gotten wrang.&#146;
249A.11	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll do ye down thro Kelso town,
	 Waken my wall-wight men;
	 And gin ye hae your wark well dune
	 I&#146;ll be there at command.&#146;
249A.12	 She&#146;s done her down thro Kelso town,
	 Wakend his wall-wight men;
	 But gin she had her wark well done
	 He was there at command.
249A.13	 He had his horse wi corn fodderd,
	 His men armd in mail;
	 He gae the Matrons half a merk
	 To show them ower the hill.
249A.14	 Willie sleepd, but Annie waked
	 Till she heard their bridles ring;
	 Then tapped on her love&#146;s shoulder,
	 And said, Ye&#146;ve sleepit lang.
249A.15	 &#145;O save me, save me, my blessd lady,
	 Till I&#146;ve on my shooting-gear;
	 I dinna fear the king himsell,
	 Tho he an&#146;s men were here.&#146;
249A.16	 Then they shot in, and Willie out,
	 The arrows graz&#146;d his brow;
	 The maid she wept and tore her hair,
	 Says, This can never do.
249A.17	 Then they shot in, and he shot out,
	 The bow brunt Willie&#146;s hand;
	 But aye he kissd her ruby lips,
	 Said, My dear, thinkna lang.
249A.18	 He set his horn to his mouth,
	 And has blawn loud and shrill,
	 And he&#146;s calld on his brother John,
	 In Ringlewood he lay still.
249A.19	 The first an shot that Lord John shot,
	 He wound fifty and fifteen;
	 The next an shot that Lord John shot,
	 He ca&#146;d out the sheriff&#146;s een.
249A.20	 &#145;O some o you lend me an arm,
	 Some o you lend me twa;
	 And they that came for strife this day,
	 Take horse, ride fast awa.
249A.21	 &#145;But wae mat fa yon, auld Matrons,
	 An ill death mat ye die!
	 I&#146;ll burn you on yon high hill-head,
	 Blaw your ashes in the sea.&#146;
