    195A.1   GOOD lord of the land, will you stay thane

         He was my faithers dead.
    195A.4   Both night and day I did proced,
         And a on him revainged to be;
         But now have I gotten what I long sowght,
         Trust me, I may not stay with the.
    195A.5   Adue, Dumfriese, that proper place!
         Fair well, Carlaurike faire!
         Adue the castle of the Trive,
         And all my buldings there!
    195A.6   Adue, Lochmaben gaits so faire,
         And the Langhm shank, where birks bobs bony!
         Adue, my leady and only joy!

    195A.7   Adue, fair Eskdale, up and doun,
         Wher my poor frends do duell!
         The bangisters will beat them doun,
         And will them sore compell.
    195A.8   Ill reveinge the cause mysell,
         Again when I come over the sea;
         Adue, my leady and only joy!
         Fore, trust me, I may not stay with the.
    195A.9   Adue, Dumlanark! fals was ay,
         And Closburn! in a band;

         When the Jhohnstones struek of his hand.
    195A.10  They wer three brethren in a band;
         I pray they may never be merry;

    195A.11  Adue, madam my mother dear,

    195A.13  He took out a good gold ring,
         Where at hang sygnets three:
         Take thou that, my own kind thing,
         And ay have mind of me.
    195A.14  Do not mary another lord
         Agan or I come over the sea;

         For, trust me, I may not stay with the.
    195A.15  The wind was fair, and the ship was clare,
         And the good lord went away;
         The most part of his frends was there,
         Giving him a fair convoy.
    195A.16  They drank the wine, they did not spare,
         Presentting in that good lords sight;
         Now he is over the floods so gray;
         Lord Maxwell has ten his last good-night.
