<PRE>

230A.1	 . . . .
	 As they came in by the Eden side,
	 They heard a lady lamenting sair,
	 Bewailing the time she was a bride.
230A.2	 . . . .
	 A stately youth of blude and lane,
	 . . . .
	 John Hately, the laird of Mellerstain.
230A.3	 &#145;Cowdenknows, had ye nae lack?
	 And Earlstoun, had ye nae shame?
	 Ye took him away beside my back,
	 But ye never saw to bring him hame.&#146;
230A.4	 And she has lookit to Fieldiesha,
	 So has she through Yirdandstane;
	 She lookit to Earlstoun, and she saw the Fans,
	 But he&#146;s coming hame by West Gordon.
230A.5	 And she staggerd and she stood,
230A.6	 . . . . . . .
	 . . . . .  wude;
	 How can I keep in my wits,
	 When I look on my husband&#146;s blood?&#146;
230A.7	 &#145;Had we been men as we are women,
	 And been at his back when he was slain,
	 It should a been tauld for mony a lang year,
	 The slaughter o the laird of Mellerstain.&#146;
