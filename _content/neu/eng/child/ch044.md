# 44: The Two Magicians


    44.1    THE lady stands in her bower door,
        As straight as willow wand;
        The blacksmith stood a little forebye,
        Wi hammer in his hand.
    44.2    Weel may ye dress ye, lady fair,
        Into your robes o red;
        Before the morn at this same time,
        Ill gain your maidenhead.
    44.3    Awa, awa, ye coal-black smith,
        Woud ye do me the wrang
        To think to gain my maidenhead,
        That I hae kept sae lang!
    44.4    Then she has hadden up her hand,
        And she sware by the mold,
        I wudna be a blacksmiths wife
        For the full o a chest o gold.
    44.5    Id rather I were dead and gone,
        And my body laid in grave,
        Ere a rusty stock o coal-black smith
        My maidenhead shoud have.
    44.6    But he has hadden up his hand,
        And he sware by the mass,
        Ill cause ye be my light leman
        For the hauf o that and less.
    44.6b   O bide, lady, bide,
        And aye he bade her bide;
        The rusty smith your leman shall be,
        For a your muckle pride.
    44.7    Then she became a turtle dow,
        To fly up in the air,
        And he became another dow,
        And they flew pair and pair.
    44.7b   O bide, lady, bide, C..
    44.8    She turnd hersell into an eel,
        To swim into yon burn,
        And he became a speckled trout,
        To gie the eel a turn.
    44.8b   O bide, lady, bide, C..
    44.9    Then she became a duck, a duck,
        To puddle in a peel,
        And he became a rose-kaimd drake,
        To gie the duck a dreel.
    44.9b   O bide, lady, bide, C..
    44.10   She turnd hersell into a hare,
        To rin upon yon hill,
        And he became a gude grey-hound,
        And boldly he did fill.
    44.10b  O bide, lady, bide, C..
    44.11   Then she became a gay grey mare,
        And stood in yonder slack,
        And he became a gilt saddle,
        And sat upon her back.
    44.11b  Was she wae, he held her sae,
        And still he bade her bide;
        The rusty smith her leman was,
        For a her muckle pride.
    44.12   Then she became a het girdle,
        And he became a cake,
        And a the ways she turnd hersell,
        The blacksmith was her make.
    44.12b  Was she wae, etc.
    44.13   She turnd hersell into a ship,
        To sail out ower the flood;
        He caed a nail intill her tail,
        And syne the ship she stood.
    44.13b  Was she wae, etc.
    44.14   Then she became a silken plaid,
        And stretchd upon a bed,
        And he became a green covering,
        And gaind her maidenhead.
    44.14b  Was she wae, etc.
