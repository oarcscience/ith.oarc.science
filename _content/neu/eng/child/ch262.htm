<PRE>

262A.1	 IT fell about the Lammas time,
	 When wightsmen won their hay,
	 A&#146; the squires in merry Linkum
	 Went a&#146; forth till a play.
262A.2	 They playd until the evening tide,
	 The sun was gaeing down;
	 A lady thro plain fields was bound,
	 A lily leesome thing.
262A.3	 Two squires that for this lady pledged,
	 In hopes for a renown,
	 The one was calld the proud Seaton,
	 The other Livingston.
262A.4	 &#145;When will ye, Michaell o Livingston,
	 Wad for this lady gay?&#146;
	 &#145;To-morrow, to-morrow,&#146; said Livingston,
	 &#145;To-morrow, if you may.&#146;
262A.5	 Then they hae wadded their wagers,
	 And laid their pledges down;
	 To the high castle o Edinbro
	 They made them ready boun.
262A.6	 The chamber that they did gang in,
	 There it was daily dight;
	 The kipples were like the gude red gowd,
	 As they stood up in hight,
	 And the roof-tree like the siller white,
	 And shin&#146;d like candles bright.
262A.7	 The lady fair into that ha
	 Was comly to be seen;
	 Her kirtle was made o the pa,
	 Her gowns seemd o the green.
262A.8	 Her gowns seemd like green, like green,
	 Her kirtle o the pa;
	 A siller wand intill her hand,
	 She marshalld ower them a&#146;.
262A.9	 She gae every knight a lady bright,
	 And every squire a may;
	 Her own sell chose him Livingston,
	 They were a comely tway.
262A.10	 Then Seaton started till his foot,
	 The fierce flame in his ee:
	 &#145;On the next day, wi sword in hand,
	 On plain fields meet ye me.&#146;
262A.11	 When bells were rung, and mass was sung,
	 And a&#146; man bound for bed,
	 Lord Livingston and his fair dame
	 In bed were sweetly laid.
262A.12	 The bed, the bed where they lay in
	 Was coverd wi the pa;
	 A covering o the gude red gowd
	 Lay nightly ower the twa.
262A.13	 So they lay there, till on the morn
	 The sun shone on their feet;
	 Then up it raise him Livingston
	 To draw to him a weed.
262A.14	 The first an weed that he drew on
	 Was o the linen clear;
	 The next an weed that he drew on,
	 It was a weed o weir.
262A.15	 The niest an weed that he drew on
	 Was gude iron and steel;
	 Twa gloves o plate, a gowden helmet,
	 Became that hind chiel weel.
262A.16	 Then out it speaks that lady gay-+--+-
	 A little forbye stood she-+--+-
	 &#145;I&#146;ll dress mysell in men&#146;s array,
	 Gae to the fields for thee.&#146;
262A.17	 &#145;O God forbid,&#146; said Livingston,
	 &#145;That eer I dree the shame;
	 My lady slain in plain fields,
	 And I coward knight at hame!&#146;
262A.18	 He scarcely travelled frae the town
	 A mile but barely twa
	 Till he met wi a witch-woman,
	 I pray to send her wae!
262A.19	 &#145;This is too gude a day, my lord,
	 To gang sae far frae town;
	 This is too gude a day, my lord,
	 On field to make you boun.
262A.20	 &#145;I dreamd a dream concerning thee,
	 O read ill dreams to guid!
	 Your bower was full o milk-white swans,
	 Your bride&#146;s bed full o bluid.&#146;
262A.21	 &#145;O bluid is gude,&#146; said Livingston,
	 &#145;To bide it whoso may;
	 If I be frae yon plain fields,
	 Nane knew the plight I lay.&#146;
262A.22	 Then he rade on to plain fields
	 As swift&#146;s his horse coud hie,
	 And ther he met the proud Seaton,
	 Come boldly ower the lee.
262A.23	 &#145;Come on to me now, Livingston,
	 Or then take foot and flee;
	 This is the day that we must try
	 Who gains the victorie.&#146;
262A.24	 Then they fought with sword in hand
	 Till they were bluidy men;
	 But on the point o Seaton&#146;s sword
	 Brave Livingston was slain.
262A.25	 His lady lay ower castle-wa,
	 Beholding dale and down,
	 When Blenchant brave, his gallant steed,
	 Came prancing to the town.
262A.26	 &#145;O where is now my ain gude lord
	 He stays sae far frae me?&#146;
	 &#145;O dinna ye see your ain gude lord
	 Stand bleeding by your knee?&#146;
262A.27	 &#145;O live, O live, Lord Livingston,
	 The space o ae half hour,
	 There&#146;s nae a leech in Edinbro town
	 But I&#146;ll bring to your door.&#146;
262A.28	 &#145;Awa wi your leeches, lady,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;Of them I&#146;ll be the waur;
	 There&#146;s nae a leech in Edinbro town
	 That can strong death debar.
262A.29	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll take the lands o Livingston
	 And deal them liberallie,
	 To the auld that may not, the young that cannot,
	 And blind that does na see,
	 And help young maidens&#146; marriages,
	 That has nae gear to gie.&#146;
262A.30	 &#145;My mother got it in a book,
	 The first night I was born,
	 I woud be wedded till a knight,
	 And him slain on the morn.
262A.31	 &#145;But I will do for my love&#146;s sake
	 What ladies woudna thole;
	 Ere seven years shall hae an end,
	 Nae shoe&#146;s gang on my sole.
262A.32	 &#145;There&#146;s never lint gang on my head,
	 Nor kame gang in my hair,
	 Nor ever coal nor candle-light
	 Shine in my bower mair.&#146;
262A.33	 When seven years were near an end,
	 The lady she thought lang,
	 And wi a crack her heart did brake,
	 And sae this ends my sang.
