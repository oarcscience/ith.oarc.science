<PRE>

50.1	O MAY she comes, and may she goes,
	Down by yon gardens green,
	And there she spied a gallant squire
	As squire had ever been.
50.2	And may she comes, and may she goes,
	Down by yon hollin tree,
	And there she spied a brisk young squire,
	And a brisk young squire was he.
50.3	&#145;Give me your green manteel, fair maid,
	Give me your maidenhead;
	Gif ye winna gie me your green manteel,
	Gi me your maidenhead.&#146;
50.4	He has taen her by the milk-white hand,
	And softly laid her down,
	And when he&#146;s lifted her up again
	Given her a silver kaim.
50.5	&#145;Perhaps there may be bairns, kind sir,
	Perhaps there may be nane;
	But if you be a courtier,
	You&#146;ll tell to me your name.&#146;
50.6	&#145;I am nae courtier, fair maid,
	But new come frae the sea;
	I am nae courtier, fair maid,
	But when I court&#146;ith thee.
50.7	&#145;They call me Jack when I&#146;m abroad,
	Sometimes they call me John;
	But when I&#146;m in my father&#146;s bower
	Jock Randal is my name.&#146;
50.8	&#145;Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny lad,
	Sae loud&#146;s I hear ye lee!
	Ffor I&#146;m Lord Randal&#146;s yae daughter,
	He has nae mair nor me.&#146;
50.9	&#145;Ye lee, ye lee, ye bonny may,
	Sae loud&#146;s I hear ye lee!
	For I&#146;m Lord Randal&#146;s yae yae son,
	Just now come oer the sea.&#146;
50.10	She&#146;s putten her hand down by her spare,
	And out she&#146;s taen a knife,
	And she has putn&#146;t in her heart&#146;s bluid,
	And taen away her life.
50.11	And he&#146;s taen up his bonny sister,
	With the big tear in his een,
	And he has buried his bonny sister
	Amang the hollins green.
50.12	And syne he&#146;s hyed him oer the dale,
	His father dear to see:
	&#145;Sing O and O for my bonny hind,
	Beneath yon hollin tree!&#146;
50.13	1 &#145;What needs you care for your bonny hyn?
	For it you needna care;
	There&#146;s aught score hyns in yonder park,
	And five score hyns to spare.
50.14	&#145;Four score of them are siller-shod,
	Of thae ye may get three;&#146;
	&#145;But O and O for my bonny hyn,
	Beneath yon hollin tree!&#146;
50.15	&#145;What needs you care for your bonny hyn?
	For it you need na care;
	Take you the best, gi me the warst,
	Since plenty is to spare.&#146;
50.16	&#145;I care na for your hyns, my lord,
	I care na for your fee;
	But O and O for my bonny hyn,
	Beneath the hollin tree!&#146;
50.17	&#145;O were ye at your sister&#146;s bower,
	Your sister fair to see,
	Ye&#146;ll think na mair o your bonny hyn
	Beneath the hollin tree.&#146;
