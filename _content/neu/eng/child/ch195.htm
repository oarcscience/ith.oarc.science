<PRE>

195A.1	 &#145;GOOD lord of the land, will you stay thane
	 About my faither&#146;s house,
	 And walk into these gardines green,
	 In my arms I&#146;ll the embraice.
195A.2	 &#145;Ten thousand times I&#146;ll kiss thy face;
	 Make sport, and let&#146;s be mery:&#146;
	 &#145;I thank you, lady, fore your kindness;
	 Trust me, I may not stay with the.
195A.3	 &#145;For I have kil&#146;d the laird Johnston;
	 I vallow not the feed;
	 My wiked heart did still incline;
	 He was my faither&#146;s dead.
195A.4	 &#145;Both night and day I did proced,
	 And a&#146; on him revainged to be;
	 But now have I gotten what I long sowght,
	 Trust me, I may not stay with the.
195A.5	 &#145;Adue, Dumfriese, that proper place!
	 Fair well, Carlaurike faire!
	 Adue the castle of the Trive,
	 And all my buldings there!
195A.6	 &#145;Adue, Lochmaben gaits so faire,
	 And the Langhm shank, where birks bobs bony!
	 Adue, my leady and only joy!
	 Trust me, I may not stay with the.
195A.7	 &#145;Adue, fair Eskdale, up and doun,
	 Wher my poor frends do duell!
	 The bangisters will beat them doun,
	 And will them sore compell.
195A.8	 &#145;I&#146;ll reveinge the cause mysell,
	 Again when I come over the sea;
	 Adue, my leady and only joy!
	 Fore, trust me, I may not stay with the.
195A.9	 &#145;Adue, Dumlanark! fals was ay,
	 And Closburn! in a band;
	 The laird of the Lag from my faither fled
	 When the Jhohnstones struek of his hand.
195A.10	 &#145;They wer three brethren in a band;
	 I pray they may never be merry;
	 Adue, my leady and only joy!
	 Trust me, I may not stay with the.
195A.11	 &#145;Adue, madam my mother dear,
	 But and my sister[s] two!
	 Fair well, Robin in the Orchet!
	 Fore the my heart is wo.
195A.12	 &#145;Adue, the lillie, and fair well, rose,
	 And the primros, spreads fair and bony!
	 Adue, my leady and only joy!
	 Fore, trust me, I may not stay with the.&#146;
195A.13	 He took out a good gold ring,
	 Where at hang sygnets three:
	 &#145;Take thou that, my own kind thing,
	 And ay have mind of me.
195A.14	 &#145;Do not mary another lord
	 Agan or I come over the sea;
	 Adue, my leady and only joy!
	 For, trust me, I may not stay with the.&#146;
195A.15	 The wind was fair, and the ship was clare,
	 And the good lord went away;
	 The most part of his frends was there,
	 Giving him a fair convoy.
195A.16	 They drank the wine, they did not spare,
	 Presentting in that good lord&#146;s sight;
	 Now he is over the floods so gray;
	 Lord Maxwell has te&#146;n his last good-night.
