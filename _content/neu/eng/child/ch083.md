    83A.1   CHILDE MAURICE hunted ithe siluer wood,
        He hunted itt round about,
        And noebodye that he found therin,
        Nor none there was with-out.
    83A.2   . . . . . .
        . . . . .
        And he tooke his siluer combe in his hand,
        To kembe his yellow lockes.
    83A.3   He sayes, Come hither, thou litle foot-page,
        That runneth lowlye by my knee,
        Ffor thou shalt goe to Iohn Stewards wiffe
        And pray her speake with mee.
    83A.4   . . . . . .
        . . . . .
        I, and greete thou doe that ladye well,
        Euer soe well froe mee.
    83A.5   And, as itt falls, as many times
        As knotts beene knitt on a kell,
        Or merchant men gone to leeue London,
        Either to buy ware or sell.
    83A.6   And, as itt falles, as many times
        As any hart can thinke,
        Or schoole-masters are in any schoole-house,
        Writting with pen and inke:
        Ffor if I might, as well as shee may,
        This night I wold with her speake.
    83A.7   And heere I send her a mantle of greene,
        As greene as any grasse,
        And bidd her come to the siluer wood,
        To hunt with Child Maurice.
    83A.8   And there I send her a ring of gold,
        A ring of precyous stone,
        And bidd her come to the siluer wood,
        Let for no kind of man.
    83A.9   One while this litle boy he yode,
        Another while he ran,
        Vntill he came to Iohn Stewards hall,
        I-wis he neuer blan.
    83A.10  And of nurture the child had good,
        Hee ran vp hall and bower free,
        And when he came to this lady faire,
        Sayes, God you saue and see!
        And when he came to this lady faire,
        Sayes, God you saue and see!
        And when he came to this lady faire,
        Sayes, God you saue and see!
    83A.11  I am come from Ch[i]ld Maurice,
        A message vnto thee;
        And Child Maurice, he greetes you well,
        And euer soe well from mee.
    83A.12  And, as itt falls, as oftentimes
        As knotts beene knitt on a kell,
        Or marchant-men gone to leeue London,
        Either for to buy ware or sell.
    83A.13  And as oftentimes he greetes you well
        As any hart can thinke,
        Or schoolemasters [are] in any schoole,
        Wryting with pen and inke.
    83A.14  And heere he sends a mantle of greene,
        As greene as any grasse,
        And he bidds you come to the siluer wood,
        To hunt with Child Maurice.
    83A.15  And heere he sends you a ring of gold,
        A ring of the precyous stone;
        He prayes you to come to the siluer wood,
        Let for no kind of man.
    83A.16  Now peace, now peace, thou litle foot-page,
        Ffor Christes sake, I pray thee!
        Ffor if my lord heare one of these words,
        Thou must be hanged hye!
    83A.17  Iohn Steward stood vnder the castle-wall,
        And he wrote the words euerye one,
        . . . . . .
        . . . . .
    83A.18  And he called vnto his hors-keeper,
        Make readye you my steede!
        I, and soe hee did to his chamberlaine,
        Make readye thou my weede!
    83A.19  And he cast a lease vpon his backe,
        And he rode to the siluer wood,
        And there he sought all about,
        About the siluer wood.
    83A.20  And there he found him Child Maurice
        Sitting vpon a blocke,
        With a siluer combe in his hand,
        Kembing his yellow locke[s.]
        * * * * *
    83A.21  But then stood vp him Child Maurice,
        And sayd these words trulye:
        I doe not know your ladye, he said,
        If that I doe her see.
    83A.22  that I doe her see.
    83A.22  He sayes, How now, how now, Child Maurice?
        Alacke, how may this bee?
        Ffor thou hast sent her loue-tokens,
        More now then two or three.
    83A.23  Ffor thou hast sent her a mantle of greene,
        As greene as any grasse,
        And bade her come to the siluer woode,
        To hunt with Child Maurice.
    83A.24  And thou [hast] sent her a ring of gold,
        A ring of the precyous stone,
        And bade her come to the siluer wood,
        Let for no kind of man.
    83A.25  And by my faith, now, Child Maurice,
        The tone of vs shall dye!
        Now be my troth, sayd Child Maurice,
        And that shall not be I.
        And soe fast he smote att Iohn Steward,
    83A.26  But hee pulled forth a bright browne sword,
        And dryed itt on the grasse,
        And the first good stroke Iohn Stewart stroke,
        I-wisse he neuer [did] rest.
    83A.27  Then hee pulled forth his bright browne sword,
        And dryed itt on his sleeue,
        And the first good stroke Iohn Stewart stroke,
        Child Maurice head he did cleeue.
    83A.28  And he pricked itt on his swords poynt,
        Went singing there beside,
        And he rode till he came to that ladye faire,
        Wheras this ladye lyed.
    83A.29  And sayes, Dost thou know Child Maurice head,
        If that thou dost itt see?
        And lapp itt soft, and kisse itt offt,
        Ffor thou louedst him better than mee.
    83A.30  But when shee looked on Child Maurice head,
        Shee neuer spake words but three:
        I neuer beare no child but one,
        And you haue slaine him trulye.
    83A.31  Sayes, Wicked be my merrymen all,
        I gaue meate, drinke, and clothe!
        But cold they not haue holden me
        When I was in all that wrath!
    83A.32  Ffor I haue slaine one of the curteousest knights
    That    euer bestrode a steed,
        Soe haue I done one [of] the fairest ladyes
    That    euer bestrode a steed,
        Soe haue I done one [of] the fairest ladyes
    That    euer ware womans weede!

### 83B: Child Maurice


    83B.Tharrt  euer ware womans weede!

### 83B: Child Maurice


    83B.1   CHILD NORYCE is a clever young man,
        He wavers wi the wind;
        His horse was silver-shod before,
        With the beaten gold behind.
    83B.2   He called to his little man John,
        Saying, You dont see what I see;
        For O yonder I see the very first woman
        That ever loved me.
    83B.3   Here is a glove, a glove, he said,
        Lined with the silver grey;
        You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood,
        To speak to Child Nory.
    83B.4   Here is a ring, a ring, he says,
        Its all gold but the stane;
        You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood,
        And ask the leave o nane.
    83B.5   So well do I love your errand, my master,
        But far better do I love my life;
        O would ye have me go to Lord Barnards castle,
        To betray away his wife?
    83B.6   O dont I give you meat, he says,
        And dont I pay you fee?
        How dare you stop my errand? he says;
        My orders you must obey.
    83B.7   O when he came to Lord Bernards castle,
        He tinkled at the ring;
        Who was as ready as Lord Barnard himself
        To let this little boy in?
    83B.8   Here is a glove, a glove, he says,
        Lined with the silver grey;
        You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood,
        To speak to Child Nory.
    83B.9   Here is a ring, a ring, he says,
        Its all gold but the stane;
        You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood,
        And ask the leave o nane.
    83B.10  Lord Barnard he was standing by,
        And an angry man was he:
        O little did I think there was a lord in the world
        My lady loved but me!
    83B.11  O he dressed himself in the holland smock,
        And garments that was gay,
        And he is away to the merry green-wood,
        To speak to Child Nory.
    83B.12  Child Noryce sits on yonder tree,
        He whistles and he sings:
        O wae be to me, says Child Noryce,
        Yonder my mother comes!
    83B.13  Child Noryce he came off the tree,
        His mother to take off the horse:
        Och alace, alace, says Child Noryce,
        My mother was neer so gross!
    83B.14  Lord Barnard he had a little small sword,
        That hung low down by his knee;
        He cut the head off Child Noryce,
        And put the body on a tree.
    83B.15  And when he came home to his castell,
        And to his ladies hall,
        He threw the head into her lap,
        Saying, Lady, theres a ball!
    83B.16  She turned up the bloody head,
        She kissed it frae cheek to chin:
        Far better do I love this bloody head
        Than all my royal kin.
    83B.17  When I was in my fathers castel,
        In my virginity,
        There came a lord into the North,
        Gat Child Noryce with me.
    83B.18  O wae be to thee, Lady Margaret, he sayd,
        And an ill death may you die;
        For if you had told me he was your son,
        He had neer been slain by me.

### 83C: Child Maurice


    83C.1   BOB NORICE is to the grein-wud gane,
        He is awa wi the wind;
        His horse is siller-shod afore,
        In the shynand gowd ahind.
    83C.2   He said unto his wee boy John,

        Its a silk but the sleive,
        And tell her to cum to the merrie green-wud,
        And ax nae bauld Barnets leive.
    83C.6   I daurna gang to Lord Barnets castel,
        I daurna gang for my lyfe;
        I daurna gang to Lord Barnets castell,
        To twyne him o his wife.
    83C.7   Do I nae pay you gowd? he said,
        Do I nae pay you fee?
        How daur you stand my bidding, Sir,
        Whan I bid you to flee?
    83C.8   Gif I maun gang to Lord Barnets castel,
        Sae sair agane my will,
        I vow a vow, and I do protest,
        It sall be dune for ill.

        He tinklet at the ring;
        Tha war nane sae ready as Lord Barnet himsell
        To let the wee calland in.
    83C.10  What news, what news, my bonnie wee boy?
        What news hae ye to me?
        Nae news, nae news, Lord Barnet, he said,
        But you ladie I fain would see.
    83C.11  Here is a pair o gluves to her,
        Thayr o the silver gray;
        And tell her to cum to the merrie green-wud,

    83C.14  Then out bespack the yellow nurse,
        Wi the babie on her knee,
        Sayand, Gif thay be cum frae Bob Norice,
        They are welcum to me.
    83C.15  O haud your tung, ye yellow nurse,
        Aloud an I heir ye lie;

        And buskt him in womans array,
        And hes awa to the merrie green-wud,

        I wot she was my first fair love
        Or ever she was yours.
    83D.20  Hes taen out a lang, lang brand
        That he was used to wear,
        And hes taen aff Gill Morice head,
        And put it on a spear:

        Play ye frae ha to bower;
        Play ye wi Gill Morice head,
        He was your paramour!
    83D.23  He was not my paramour,

        And in my maiden -weed.
    83D.24  I got him in my mothers bower,

        Got mony a shower o rain.
    83D.25  But I will kiss his bluidy head,
        And I will clap his chin;
        Ill make a vow, and keep it true,
        Ill never kiss man again.
    83D.26  Oftimes I by his cradle sat,
        And fond to see him sleep;
        But I may walk about his grave,
        And fond to see him sleep;
        But I may walk about his grave,
        The saut tears for to weep.
    83D.27  Bring cods, bring cods to my ladye,
        Her heart is full of wae;
        None of your cods, Burnet, she says,
        But lay me on the strae.
    83D.28  Pox on you, my lady fair,
        That wudna telled it me;

        He had not been slain by me;
        And for ae penny ye wud hae gien
        I wud hae gien him three.
        And for ae penny ye wud hae gien
        I wud hae gien him three.
    83D.29  Keep weel your land, Burnet, she said,
        Your land and white monie;
        Theres land eneuch in Norroway
        Lies heirless I wot the day.
    83D.30  The one was killed in the mornin air,
        His mother died at een,
        And or the mornin bells was rung

### 83E: Child Maurice


    83E.1   CHIELD MORRICE was an earls son,
        His name it waxed wide;
        It was nae for his parentage,
        Nor yet his meikle pride,
        But it was for a lady gay,
        That lived on Carron side.
    83E.2   O Willie, my man, my errand gang,
        And you maun rin wi speed;
        When other boys run on their feet,
        On horseback ye shall ride.
    83E.3   O master dear, I love you weel,
        And I love you as my life,
        But I will not go to Lord Barnards ha,
        For to tryst forth his wife.
    83E.4   For the baron hes a man of might,
        He neer could bide a taunt,
        And ye shall see or it be late
        How meikle yell hae to vaunt.
    83E.5   O you must rin my errand, Willie,
        And you must rin wi speed,
        And if you dont obey my high command
        Ill gar your body bleed.
    83E.6   And here it is a gay manteel,
        Its a gowd but the hem;
        Bid her come speak to Chield Morice,
        Bring naebody but her lane.
    83E.7   And here it is a holland smock,
        her own hand sewed the sleeve;
        Bid her come speak to Chield Morice,
        Ask not the barons leave.
    83E.8   Since I must run this errand for you,
        So sore against my will,
        Ive made a vow, and Ill keep it true,
        It shall be done for ill.
    83E.9   For he did not ask the porters leave,
        Tho he stood at the gate,
        But straight he ran to the big hall,
        Where great folk sat at meat.
    83E.10  Good hallow, gentle sir and dame,
        My errand canno wait;
        Dame, ye must go speak to Chield Morice,
        Before it be too late.
    83E.11  And here it is a gay manteel,
        Its a goud but the hem;
        Ye must come speak to Child Morice,
        Bring nae body but your lane.
    83E.12  And here it is a holland smock,
        Your ain hand sewed the sleeve;
        You must come speak to Chield Morice,
        Ask not the barons leave.
    83E.13  O aye she stamped wi her foot,
        And winked wi her ee,
        But a that she could say or do,
        Forbidden he wad na be.
    83E.14  Its surely to my bouir-woman,
        It canna be to me:
        I brocht it to Lord Barnards lady,
        And I trow that thou art she.
    83E.15  Out then spak the wylie nurse,
        Wi the bairn just on her knee:
        If this be come fra Chield Morice,
        Its dear welcome to me.
    83E.16  Thou lies, thou lies, thou wylie nurse,
        Sae louds I hear thee lie;
        I brought it to Lord Barnards lady,
        And I trow thou binna she.
        I brought it to Lord Barnards lady,
        And I trow thou binna she.
    83E.17  Then up and rose him the bold baron,
        And an angry man was he;
        He took the table wi his foot,
        And keppd it wi his knee,
        Till silver cup and ezar dish
        In flinders they did flee.
    83E.18  Go gring me one of thy cleeding,
        That hings upon the pin,
        And Ill awa to the good green-wood,
        And crack wi your leman.
    83E.19  I would have you stay at home, Lord Barnard,
        I would have you stay at home;
        Never wyte a man for violence douce
        That never thought you wrong.
    83E.20  And when he to the green-wood went,
        No body saw he there
        But Chield Morice, on a milk-white steed,
        Combing down his yellow hair.
    83E.21  Chield Morice sat in the gay green-wood,
        He whistled and he sang:
        O what means a thir folks coming?
        My mother tarries lang.
    83E.22  mother tarries lang.
    83E.22  No wonder, no wonder, Chield Morice, he said,
        My lady loved thee weel;
        For the whitest bit of my body
        Is blacker than thy heel.
    83E.23  But nevertheless now, Chield Morice,
        For a thy gay beautie,
        O nevertheless, Chield Morice,
        Thy head shall go with me.
    83E.24  He had a rapier by his side,
        Hung low down by his knee;
        He struck Chield Morrice on the neck,
        Till aff his head did flee.
    83E.25  Then hes taen up that bloody head,
        And stuck it on a spear,
        And the meanest man in a his train
        Gat Chield Morice head to bear.
    83E.26  The lady looked owre the castle-wa,
        Wi meikle dool and down,
        And there she saw Chield Morice head,
        Coming trailing to the town.
    83E.27  But hes taen up this bluidy head,
        And dashed it gainst the wa:
        Come down, come down, you ladies fair,
        And play at this foot-ba.
    83E.28  Then shes taen up this bluidy head,
        And an ill deid may thou die!
        And she kissed it both cheek and chin:
        I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
        Than a thy earldom.
        I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
        Than a thy earldom.
        I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
        Than a thy earldom.
    83E.29  I got him in my fathers bouir,
        Wi meikle sin and shame,
        And I brought him up in gay green-wood,
        Beneath the heavy rain.
    83E.30  Many a day have I rockd thy cradle,
        And fondly seen thee sleep,
        But now Ill go about thy grave,
        And sore, sore will I weep.
    83E.31  O woe be to thee, thou wild woman,
        And an ill deid may thou die!
        For if ye had tauld me he was your son,
        He should hae ridden and gane wi me.
    83E.32  O hold your tongue, you bold baron,
        And an ill death may ye die!
        He had lands and rents enew of his ain,
        He needed nane fra thee.
    83E.33  Then Ill curse the hand that did the deed,
        The heart that thought him ill,
        The feet that carried me speedilie
        This comely youth to kill.
    83E.34  This lady she died gin ten oclock,
        Lord Barnard died gin twall,
        And bonnie boy now, Sweet Willie,
        Whats come o him I canna tell.

### 83F: Child Maurice


    83F.1   GIL MORRICE was an erles son,
        His name it waxed wide;
        It was nae for his great riches,
        Nor yet his mickle pride,

        How can ye strive against the stream?
        For I sall be obeyd.
    83F.6   Bot, O my master dear, he cryd,

        Speir nae bauld barons leave.
    83F.10  Yes, I will gae your black errand,
        Though it be to your cost;
        Sen ye by me will nae be warnd,
        In it ye sall find frost.

    83F.13  And when he came to broken brigue,
        He bent his bow and swam;
        And when [he] came to grass growing,
        Set down his feet and ran.
    83F.14  And when he came to Barnards ha,
        Would neither chap nor ca,
        Bot set his bent bow to his breist,
        And lichtly lap the wa.

        My mother tarries lang.
    83F.27  The baron came to the grene-wode,

        And there he first spied Gill Morice,
        Kameing his yellow hair.
    83F.28  Nae wonder, nae wonder, Gill Morice,
        My lady loed thee weel;
        The fairest part of my body
        Is blacker than thy heel.

        And there she saw Gill Morice head
        Cum trailing to the toun.
    83F.34  Far better I loe that bluidy head,

        O better I loe my Gill Morice
        Than a my kith and kin!

    83G.1   GIL MORRICE sat in silver wood,

        Whar sall I get a bonny boy
        My errand for to gang?
    83G.2   He cad his foster-brither Willie:
        Come, win ye hose and shoon,
        And gae unto Lord Barnards ha,
        And bid his lady come.
