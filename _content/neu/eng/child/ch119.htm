	 As they went bi the wey;
	 Litull John seid he had won fiue shillings,
	 And Robyn Hode seid schortly nay.
119A.14	 With that Robyn Hode lyed Litul Jon,
	 And smote hym with his hande;
	 Litul Jon waxed wroth therwith,
	 And pulled out his bright bronde.

	 To bryng hym out saue agayn.
119A.18	 He gos in to Seynt Mary chirch,
	 And kneled down before the rode;
	 Alle that euer were the church within

	 To the kyrk with hym can fare.
119A.25	 In at the durres thei throly thrast,
	 With staves ful gode wone;

	 And woundyt mony a moder son,
	 And twelue he slew that day.

	 &#145;And let this mournyng be;
	 And I shal be the munkis gyde,
	 With the myght of mylde Mary.
119A.36	 . . . .
	 &#145;We will go but we too;
	 And I mete hym,&#146; seid Litul John,
	 . . .
119A.37	 &#145;Loke that y+oe kepe wel owre tristil-tre,
	 Vnder the levys smale,
	 And spare non of this venyson,
RRthat	gose in thys vale.&#146;
119A.38	 Fforthe then went these y+oemen too,
	 Litul John and Moche on fere,
	 And lokid on Moch emys hows,
	 THe hye way lay full nere.
119A.39	 Litul John stode at a wyndow in the mornyng,
	 And lokid forth at a stage;
	 He was war wher the munke came ridyng,
	 And with hym a litul page.

	 &#145;I can the tel tithyngus gode;
	 I se wher the munke cumys rydyng,
	 I know hym be his wyde hode.&#146;
119A.41	 They went in to the way, these y+oemen bothe,
	 As curtes men and hende;
	 THei spyrred tithyngus at the munke,
	 As they hade bene his frende.
119A.42	 &#145;Ffro whens come y+oe?&#146; seid Litull Jon,
	 &#145;Tel vs tithyngus, I yow pray,

	 We wil go with you, with your leve,
	 And bryng yow on your way.
119A.46	 &#145;Ffor Robyn Hode hase many a wilde felow,
	 I tell you in certen;
	 If thei wist y+oe rode this way,
	 In feith y+oe shulde be slayn.&#146;

119A.49	 Be the golett of the hode
	 John pulled the munke down;
	 John was nothyng of hym agast,
	 He lete hym falle on his crown.
119A.50	 Litull John was so[re] agrevyd,
	 And drew owt his swerde in hye;
	 This munke saw he shulde be ded,
	 Lowd mercy can he crye.
119A.51	 &#145;He was my maister,&#146; seid Litull John,
	 &#145;RRthat thou hase browy+ot in bale;
	 Shalle thou neuer cum at our kyng,
	 Ffor to telle hym tale.&#146;
119A.52	 John smote of the munkis hed,
	 No longer wolde he dwell;
	 So did Moch the litull page,
	 Ffor ferd lest he wolde tell.
119A.53	 RRther thei beryed hem bothe,
	 In nouther mosse nor lyng,
	 And Litull John and Much infere
	 Bare the letturs to oure kyng.
119A.54	 . . . .
	 He knelid down vpon his kne:
	 &#145;God y+oow saue, my lege lorde,
	 Ihesus yow saue and se!
119A.55	 &#145;God yow saue, my lege kyng!&#146;
	 To speke John was full bolde;
	 He gaf hym the letturs in his hond,
	 The kyng did hit vnfold.
119A.56	 THe kyng red the letturs anon,
	 And seid, So mot I the,
RRther	was neuer y+ooman in mery Inglond
	 I longut so sore to se.
119A.57	 &#145;Wher is the munke that these shuld haue brouy+ot?&#146;
	 Oure kyng can say:
	 &#145;Be my trouth,&#146; seid Litull John,
	 &#145;He dyed after the way.&#146;
119A.58	 THe kyng gaf Moch and Litul Jon
	 Twenti pound in sertan,
	 And made theim y+oemen of the crown,
	 And bade theim go agayn.
119A.59	 He gaf John the seel in hand,
	 The sheref for to bere,
	 To bryng Robyn hym to,
	 And no man do hym dere.
119A.60	 n toke his leve at oure kyng,
	 THe sothe as I yow say;
	 THe next way to Notyngham
	 To take, he y+oede the way.
119A.61	 Whan John came to Notyngham
	 The y+oatis were sparred ychon;
	 John callid vp the porter,
	 He answerid sone anon.
119A.62	 &#145;What is the cause,&#146; seid Litul Jon,
	 &#145;RRthou sparris the y+oates so fast?&#146;
	 &#145;Because of Robyn Hode,&#146; seid [the] porter,
	 &#145;In depe prison is cast.
119A.63	 &#145;John and Moch and Wyll Scathlok,
	 Ffor sothe as I yow say,
	 THei slew oure men vpon our wallis,
	 And sawten vs euery day.&#146;
119A.64	 Litull John spyrred after the schereff,
	 And sone he hym fonde;
	 He oppyned the kyngus priue seell,
	 And gaf hym in his honde.
119A.65	 Whan the scheref saw the kyngus seell,
	 He did of his hode anon:
	 &#145;Wher is the munke that bare the letturs?&#146;
	 He seid to Litull John.
119A.66	 &#145;He is so fayn of hym,&#146; seid Litul John,
	 &#145;Ffor sothe as I yow say,
	 He has made hym abot of Westmynster,
	 A lorde of that abbay.&#146;
119A.67	 The scheref made John gode chere,
	 And gaf hym wyne of the best;
	 At nyy+ot thei went to her bedde,
	 And euery man to his rest.
119A.68	 When the scheref was on slepe,
	 Dronken of wyne and ale,
	 Litul John and Moch for sothe
	 Toke the way vnto the jale.
119A.69	 Litul John callid vp the jayler,
	 And bade hym rise anon;
	 He seyd Robyn Hode had brokyn prison,
	 And out of hit was gon.
119A.70	 The porter rose anon sertan,
	 As sone as he herd John calle;
	 Litul John was redy with a swerd,
	 And bare hym to the walle.
119A.71	 &#145;Now wil I be porter,&#146; seid Litul John,
	 &#145;And take the keyes in honde:&#146;
	 He toke the way to Robyn Hode,
	 And sone he hym vnbonde.
119A.72	 He gaf hym a gode swerd in his hond,
	 His hed [ther]with for to kepe,
	 And ther as the walle was lowyst
	 Anon down can thei lepe.
119A.73	 Be that the cok began to crow,
	 The day began to spryng;
	 The scheref fond the jaylier ded,
	 The comyn bell made he ryng.
119A.74	 He made a crye thoroout al the tow[n],
	 Wheder he be y+ooman or knave,
RRthat	cowthe bryng hym Robyn Hode,
	 His warison he shuld haue.
119A.75	 &#145;Ffor I dar neuer,&#146; said the scheref,
	 &#145;Cum before oure kyng;
	 Ffor if I do, I wot serten
	 Ffor sothe he wil me heng.&#146;
119A.76	 The scheref made to seke Notyngham,
	 Bothe be strete and stye,
	 And Robyn was in mery Scherwode,
	 As liy+ot as lef on lynde.
119A.77	 Then bespake gode Litull John,
	 To Robyn Hode can he say,
	 I haue done the a gode turne for an euyll,
	 Quyte the whan thou may.
119A.78	 &#145;I haue done the a gode turne,&#146; seid Litull John,
	 &#145;Ffor sothe as I yow say;
	 I haue brouy+ot the vnder grene-wode lyne;
	 Ffare wel, and haue gode day.&#146;
119A.79	 &#145;Nay, be my trouth,&#146; seid Robyn Hode,
	 &#145;So shall hit neuer be;
	 I make the maister,&#146; seid Robyn Hode,
	 &#145;Off alle my men and me.&#146;
119A.80	 &#145;Nay, be my trouth,&#146; seid Litull John,
	 &#145;So shalle hit neuer be;
	 But lat me be a felow,&#146; seid Litull John,
	 &#145;No noder kepe I be.&#146;
119A.81	 Thus John gate Robyn Hod out of prison,
	 Sertan withoutyn layn;
	 Whan his men saw hym hol and sounde,
	 Ffor sothe they were full fayne.
119A.82	 They filled in wyne, and made hem glad,
	 Vnder the levys smale,
	 And y+oete pastes of venyson,
	 THat gode was with ale.
119A.83	 Than worde came to oure kyng
	 How Robyn Hode was gon,
	 And how the scheref of Notyngham
	 Durst neuer loke hym vpon.
119A.84	 Then bespake oure cumly kyng,
	 In an angur hye:
	 Litull John hase begyled the schereff,
	 In faith so hase he me.
119A.85	 Litul John has begyled vs bothe,
	 And that full wel I se;
	 Or ellis the schereff of Notyngham
	 Hye hongut shulde he be.
119A.86	 &#145;I made hem y+oemen of the crowne,
	 And gaf hem fee with my hond;
	 I gaf hem grith,&#146; seid oure kyng,
	 &#145;Thorowout all mery Inglond.
119A.87	 &#145;I gaf theym grith,&#146; then seid oure kyng;
	 &#145;I say, so mot I the,
	 Ffor sothe soch a y+oeman as he is on
	 In all Inglond ar not thre.
119A.88	 &#145;He is trew to his maister,&#146; seid our kyng;
	 &#145;I sey, be swete Seynt John,
	 He louys better Robyn Hode
	 Then he dose vs ychon.
119A.89	 &#145;Robyn Hode is euer bond to hym,
	 Bothe in strete and stalle;
	 Speke no more of the mater,&#146; seid oure kyng,
	 &#145;But John has begyled vs alle.&#146;
119A.90	 Thus endys the talkyng of the munke
	 And Robyn Hode i-wysse;
	 God, that is euer a crowned kyng,
	 Bryng vs all to his blisse!
