<PRE>

300A.1	 THERE was a maid, richly arrayd,
	 In robes were rare to see,
	 For seven years and something mair
	 She servd a gay ladie.
300A.2	 But being fond o a higher place,
	 In service she thought lang;
	 She took her mantle her about,
	 Her coffer by the band.
300A.3	 And as she walkd by the shore-side,
	 As blythe&#146;s a bird on tree,
	 Yet still she gaz&#146;d her round about,
	 To see what she could see.
300A.4	 At last she spied a little castle,
	 That stood near by the sea;
	 She spied it far and drew it near,
	 To that castle went she.
300A.5	 And when she came to that castle
	 She tirled at the pin,
	 And ready stood a little wee boy
	 To lat this fair maid in.
300A.6	 &#145;O who&#146;s the owner of this place,
	 O porter-boy, tell me;&#146;
	 &#145;This place belongs unto a queen
	 O birth and high degree.&#146;
300A.7	 She put her hand in her pocket,
	 And gae him shillings three:
	 &#145;O porter, bear my message well
	 Unto the queen frae me.&#146;
300A.8	 The porter&#146;s gane before the queen,
	 Fell low down on his knee:
	 &#145;Win up, win up, my porter-boy,
	 What makes this courtesie?&#146;
300A.9	 &#145;I hae been porter at your yetts,
	 My dame, these years full three,
	 But see a ladie at your yetts
	 The fairest my eyes did see.&#146;
300A.10	 &#145;Cast up my yetts baith wide and braid,
	 Lat her come in to me,
	 And I&#146;ll know by her courtesie
	 Lord&#146;s daughter if she be.&#146;
300A.11	 When she came in before the queen,
	 Fell low down on her knee:
	 &#145;Service frae you, my dame the queen,
	 I pray you grant it me.&#146;
300A.12	 &#145;If that service ye now do want,
	 What station will ye be?
	 Can ye card wool, or spin, fair maid,
	 Or milk the cows to me?&#146;
300A.13	 &#145;No, I can neither card nor spin,
	 Nor cows I canno milk,
	 But sit into a lady&#146;s bower
	 And sew the seams o silk.&#146;
300A.14	 &#145;What is your name, ye comely dame?
	 Pray tell this unto me:&#146;
	 &#145;O Blancheflour, that is my name,
	 Born in a strange countrie.&#146;
300A.15	 &#145;O keep ye well frae Jellyflorice-+--+-
	 My ain dear son is he-+--+-
	 When other ladies get a gift,
	 O that ye shall get three.&#146;
300A.16	 It wasna tald into the bower
	 Till it went thro the ha,
	 That Jellyflorice and Blancheflour
	 Were grown ower great witha.
300A.17	 When the queen&#146;s maids their visits paid,
	 Upo the gude Yule-day,
	 When other ladies got horse to ride,
	 She boud take foot and gae.
300A.18	 The queen she calld her stable-groom,
	 To come to her right seen;
	 Says, Ye&#146;ll take out yon wild waith steed
	 And bring him to the green.
300A.19	 &#145;Ye&#146;ll take the bridle frae his head,
	 The lighters frae his een;
	 Ere she ride three times roun the cross,
	 Her weel-days will be dune.&#146;
300A.20	 Jellyflorice his true-love spy&#146;d
	 As she rade roun the cross,
	 And thrice he kissd her lovely lips,
	 And took her frae her horse.
300A.21	 &#145;Gang to your bower, my lily-flower,
	 For a&#146; my mother&#146;s spite;
	 There&#146;s nae other amang her maids,
	 In whom I take delight.
300A.22	 &#145;Ye are my jewel, and only ane,
	 Nane &#146;s do you injury;
	 For ere this-day-month come and gang
	 My wedded wife ye&#146;se be.&#146;
