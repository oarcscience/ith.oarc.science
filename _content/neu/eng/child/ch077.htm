<PRE>

77A.1	THERE came a ghost to Margret&#146;s door,
	With many a grievous groan,
	And ay he tirled at the pin,
	But answer made she none.
77A.2	&#145;Is that my father Philip,
	Or is&#146;t my brother John?
	Or is&#146;t my true-love, Willy,
	From Scotland new come home?&#146;
77A.3	&#145;&#146;Tis not thy father Philip,
	Nor yet thy brother John;
	But &#146;tis thy true-love, Willy,
	From Scotland new come home.
77A.4	&#145;O sweet Margret, O dear Margret,
	I pray thee speak to me;
	Give me my faith and troth, Margret,
	As I gave it to thee.&#146;
77A.5	&#145;Thy faith and troth thou&#146;s never get,
	Nor yet will I thee lend,
	Till that thou come within my bower,
	And kiss my cheek and chin.&#146;
77A.6	&#145;If I shoud come within thy bower,
	I am no earthly man;
	And shoud I kiss thy rosy lips,
	Thy days will not be lang.
77A.7	&#145;O sweet Margret, O dear Margret,
	I pray thee speak to me;
	Give me my faith and troth, Margret,
	As I gave it to thee.&#146;
77A.8	&#145;Thy faith and troth thou&#146;s never get,
	Nor yet will I thee lend,
	Till you take me to yon kirk,
	And wed me with a ring.&#146;
77A.9	&#145;My bones are buried in yon kirk-yard,
	Afar beyond the sea,
	And it is but my spirit, Margret,
	That&#146;s now speaking to thee.&#146;
77A.10	She stretchd out her lilly-white hand,
	And, for to do her best,
	&#145;Hae, there&#146;s your faith and troth, Willy,
	God send your soul good rest.&#146;
77A.11	Now she has kilted her robes of green
	A piece below her knee,
	And a&#146; the live-lang winter night
	The dead corp followed she.
77A.12	&#145;Is there any room at your head, Willy?
	Or any room at your feet?
	Or any room at your side, Willy,
	Wherein that I may creep?&#146;
77A.13	&#145;There&#146;s no room at my head, Margret,
	There&#146;s no room at my feet;
	There&#146;s no room at my side, Margret,
	My coffin&#146;s made so meet.&#146;
77A.14	Then up and crew the red, red cock,
	And up then crew the gray:
	&#145;Tis time, tis time, my dear Margret,
	That you were going away.&#146;
77A.15	No more the ghost to Margret said,
	But, with a grievous groan,
	Evanishd in a cloud of mist,
	And left her all alone.
77A.16	&#145;O stay, my only true-love, stay,&#146;
	The constant Margret cry&#146;d;
	Wan grew her cheeks, she closd her een,
	Stretchd her soft limbs, and dy&#146;d.

77B.1	WHAN bells war rung, an mass was sung,
	A wat a&#146; man to bed were gone,
	Clark Sanders came to Margret&#146;s window,
	With mony a sad sigh and groan.
77B.2	&#145;Are ye sleeping, Margret,&#146; he says,
	&#145;Or are ye waking, presentlie?
	Give me my faith and trouthe again,
	A wat, trew-love, I gied to thee.&#146;
77B.3	&#145;Your faith and trouth ye&#146;s never get,
	Nor our trew love shall never twain,
	Till ye come with me in my bower,
	And kiss me both cheek and chin.&#146;
77B.4	&#145;My mouth it is full cold, Margret,
	It has the smell now of the ground;
	And if I kiss thy comely mouth,
	Thy life-days will not be long.
77B.5	&#145;Cocks are crowing a merry mid-larf,
	I wat the wild fule boded day;
	Gie me my faith and trouthe again,
	And let me fare me on my way.&#146;
77B.6	&#145;Thy faith and trouth thou shall na get,
	Nor our trew love shall never twin,
	Till ye tell me what comes of women
	Awat that dy&#146;s in strong traveling.&#146;
77B.7	&#145;Their beds are made in the heavens high,
	Down at the foot of our good Lord&#146;s knee,
	Well set about wi gilly-flowers,
	A wat sweet company for to see.
77B.8	&#145;O cocks are crowing a merry midd-larf,
	A wat the wilde foule boded day;
	The salms of Heaven will be sung,
	And ere now I&#146;le be misst away.&#146;
77B.9	Up she has tain a bright long wand,
	And she has straked her trouth thereon;
	She has given [it] him out at the shot-window,
	Wi many a sad sigh and heavy groan.
77B.10	&#145;I thank you, Margret, I thank you, Margret,
	And I thank you hartilie;
	Gine ever the dead come for the quick,
	Be sure, Margret, I&#146;ll come again for thee.&#146;
77B.11	It&#146;s hose an shoon an gound alane
	She clame the wall and followed him,
	Untill she came to a green forest,
	On this she lost the sight of him.
77B.12	&#145;Is their any room at your head, Sanders?
	Is their any room at your feet?
	Or any room at your twa sides?
	Whare fain, fain woud I sleep.&#146;
77B.13	&#145;Their is na room at my head, Margret,
	Their is na room at my feet;
	There is room at my twa sides,
	For ladys for to sleep.
77B.14	&#145;Cold meal is my covering owre,
	But an my winding sheet;
	My bed it is full low, I say,
	Down among the hongerey worms I sleep.
77B.15	&#145;Cold meal is my covering owre,
	But an my winding sheet;
	The dew it falls na sooner down
	Then ay it is full weet.&#146;

77C.1	LADY MARJORIE, Lady Marjorie,
	Sat sewing her silken seam;
	By her came a pale, pale ghost,
	With many a sich and mane.
77C.2	&#145;Are ye my father, the king?&#146; she says,
	&#145;Or are ye my brother John?
	Or are you my true-love, Sweet William,
	From England newly come?&#146;
77C.3	&#145;I&#146;m not your father, the king,&#146; he says,
	&#145;No, no, nor your brother John;
	But I&#146;m your true love, Sweet William,
	From England that&#146;s newly come.&#146;
77C.4	&#145;Have ye brought me any scarlets so red?
	Or any silks so fine?
	Or have ye brought me any precious things,
	That merchants have for sale?&#146;
77C.5	&#145;I have not brought you any scarlets sae red,
	No, no, nor the silks so fine;
	But I have brought you my winding-sheet,
	Oer many&#146;s the rock and hill.
77C.6	&#145;O Lady Marjory, Lady Marjory,
	For faith and charitie,
	Will you give to me my faith and troth,
	That I gave once to thee?&#146;
77C.7	&#145;O your faith and troth I&#146;ll not give thee,
	No, no, that will not I,
	Until I get one kiss of your ruby lips,
	And in my arms you come [lye].&#146;
77C.8	&#145;My lips they are so bitter,&#146; he says,
	&#145;My breath it is so strong,
	If you get one kiss of my ruby lips,
	Your days will not be long.
77C.9	&#145;The cocks they are crowing, Marjory,&#146; he says,
	&#145;The cocks they are crawing again;
	It&#146;s time the deid should part the quick,
	Marjorie, I must be gane.&#146;
77C.10	She followed him high, she followed him low,
	Till she came to yon church-yard;
	O there the grave did open up,
	And young William he lay down.
77C.11	&#145;What three things are these, Sweet William,&#146; she says,
	&#145;That stands here at your head?&#146;
	&#145;It&#146;s three maidens, Marjorie,&#146; he says,
	&#145;That I promised once to wed.&#146;
77C.12	&#145;What three things are these, Sweet William,&#146; she says,
	&#145;That stands here at your side?&#146;
	&#145;It is three babes, Marjorie,&#146; he says,
	&#145;That these three maidens had.&#146;
77C.13	&#145;What three things are these, Sweet William,&#146; she says,
	&#145;That stands here at your feet?&#146;
	It is three hell-hounds, Marjorie,&#146; he says,
	&#145;That&#146;s waiting my soul to keep.&#146;
77C.14	She took up her white, white hand,
	And she struck him in the breast,
	Saying, Have there again your faith and troth,
	And I wish your soul good rest.

	She heard a mournfu moan.
77E.2	&#145;O is it my father? O is it my mother?

	There some are hie hangd for huring,
	And some for adulterie.&#146;

77F.1	WHEN seven years were come and gane,
	Lady Margaret she thought lang;
	And she is up to the hichest tower,
	By the lee licht o the moon.
77F.2	She was lookin oer her castle high,
	To see what she might fa,
	And there she saw a grieved ghost,
	Comin waukin oer the wa.
77F.3	&#145;O are ye a man of mean,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Seekin ony o my meat?
	Or are you a rank robber,
	Come in my bower to break?&#146;

	Is there ony room at your feet?
	Is there ony room at your twa sides,
	For a lady to lie and sleep?&#146;
77F.9	&#145;There is nae room at my head, Margaret,
	As little at my feet;
	There is nae room at my twa sides,
	For a lady to lie and sleep.
77F.10	&#145;But gae hame, gae hame now, May Margaret,
	Gae hame and sew your seam;

	And she gaed weeping away.
