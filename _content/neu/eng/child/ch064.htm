	In case that his days are dune.&#146;
64A.2	Janet&#146;s awa to her father,
	As fast as she could hie:
	&#145;O what&#146;s your will wi me, father?
	O what&#146;s your will wi me?&#146;
64A.3	&#145;My will wi you, Fair Janet,&#146; he said,
	&#145;It is both bed and board;
	Some say that he loe Sweet Willie,
	But ye maun wed a French lord.&#146;
64A.4	&#145;A French lord maun I wed, father?

	But Sweet Willie her jo?
64A.6	&#145;O we maun part this love, Willie,
	That has been lang between;
	There&#146;s a French lord coming oer the sea,
	To wed me wi a ring;
	There&#146;s a French lord coming oer the sea,
	To wed and tak me hame.&#146;
64A.7	&#145;If we maun part this love, Janet,
	It causeth mickle woe;
	If we maun part this love, Janet,
	It makes me into mourning go.&#146;
64A.8	&#145;But ye maun gang to your three sisters,
	Meg, Marion, and Jean;
	Tell them to come to Fair Janet,
	In case that her days are dune.&#146;
64A.9	Willie&#146;s awa to his three sisters,
	Meg, Marion, and Jean:
	&#145;O haste, and gang to Fair Janet,
	I fear that her days are dune.&#146;
64A.10	Some drew to them their silken hose,
	Some drew to them their shoon,
	Some drew to them their silk manteils,
	Their covering to put on,
	And they&#146;re awa to Fair Janet,
	By the hie light o the moon.
	* * * * *
64A.11	&#145;O I have born this babe, Willie,
	Wi mickle toil and pain;
	Take hame, take hame, your babe, Willie,
	For nurse I dare be nane.&#146;
64A.12	He&#146;s tane his young son in his arms,
	And kisst him cheek and chin,
	And he&#146;s awa to his mother&#146;s bower,
	By the hie light o the moon.
64A.13	&#145;O open, open, mother,&#146; he says,
	&#145;O open, and let me in;
	The rain rains on my yellow hair,
	And the dew drops oer my chin,
	And I hae my young son in my arms,
	I fear that his days are dune.&#146;
64A.14	With her fingers lang and sma
	She lifted up the pin,
	And with her arms lang and sma
	Received the baby in.
64A.15	&#145;Gae back, gae back now, Sweet Willie,
	And comfort your fair lady;
	For where ye had but ae nourice,
	Your young son shall hae three.&#146;
64A.16	Willie he was scarce awa,
	And the lady put to bed,
	Whan in and came her father dear:
	&#145;Make haste, and busk the bride.&#146;
64A.17	&#145;There&#146;s a sair pain in my head, father,
	There&#146;s a sair pain in my side;
	And ill, O ill, am I, father,
	This day for to be a bride.&#146;
64A.18	&#145;O ye maun busk this bonny bride,
	And put a gay mantle on;
	For she shall wed this auld French lord,
	Gin she should die the morn.&#146;
64A.19	Some put on the gay green robes,
	And some put on the brown;
	But Janet put on the scarlet robes,
	To shine foremost throw the town.
64A.20	And some they mounted the black steed,
	And some mounted the brown;
	But Janet mounted the milk-white steed,
	To ride foremost throw the town.
64A.21	&#145;O wha will guide your horse, Janet?
	O wha will guide him best?&#146;
	&#145;O wha but Willie, my true-love?
	He kens I loe him best.&#146;
64A.22	And when they cam to Marie&#146;s kirk,
	To tye the haly ban,
	Fair Janet&#146;s cheek looked pale and wan,
	And her colour gaed an cam.
64A.23	When dinner it was past and done,
	And dancing to begin,
	&#145;O we&#146;ll go take the bride&#146;s maidens,
	And we&#146;ll go fill the ring.&#146;
64A.24	O ben than cam the auld French lord,
	Saying, Bride, will ye dance with me?
	&#145;Awa, awa, ye auld French lord,
	Your face I downa see.&#146;
64A.25	O ben than cam now Sweet Willie,
	He cam with ane advance:
	&#145;O I&#146;ll go tak the bride&#146;s maidens,
	And we&#146;ll go tak a dance.&#146;
64A.26	&#145;I&#146;ve seen ither days wi you, Willie,
	And so has mony mae,
	Ye would hae danced wi me mysel,
	Let a&#146; my maidens gae.&#146;
64A.27	O ben than cam now Sweet Willie,
	Saying, Bride, will ye dance wi me?
	&#145;Aye, by my sooth, and that I will,
	Gin my back should break in three.&#146;
64A.28	She had nae turned her throw the dance,
	Throw the dance but thrice,
	When she fell doun at Willie&#146;s feet,
	And up did never rise.
64A.29	Willie&#146;s taen the key of his coffer,
	And gien it to his man:
	&#145;Gae hame, and tell my mother dear
	My horse he has me slain;
	Bid her be kind to my young son,
	For father he has nane.&#146;
64A.30	The tane was buried in Marie&#146;s kirk,
	And the tither in Marie&#146;s quire;
	Out of the tane there grew a birk,
	And the tither a bonny brier.

	Ye&#146;ll shew to me truelie;
	Ye&#146;ll build to me a bonnie ship,
	And set her on the sea.&#146;
64B.2	He did love her very weel,
	He shewed to her trulie;
	He builded her a bonnie ship,
	And set her on the sea.
64B.3	They had not sailed one league, one league,
	One league but only three,
	Till sharp, sharp showers fair Janet took,
	She grew sick and like to die.
64B.4	&#145;If you do love me weel, Willie,
	Ye&#146;ll shew to me trulye;
	Ye&#146;ll tak me to my mother&#146;s bower,
	Whare I was wont to be.&#146;
64B.5	He did love her very weel,
	He shewed to her trulye;
	He took her to her mother&#146;s bower,
	Whare she was wont to be.
64B.6	&#145;It&#146;s ye&#146;ll stand up at my richt side,
	You will on tiptaes stand,
	Until you hear your auld son weep,
	But an you Janet mourn.
64B.7	&#145;Come take your auld son in your arms,
	He is both large and lang;
	Come take your auld son in your arms,
	And for a nourice gang.&#146;
64B.8	He is to his mother&#146;s bowers,
	An hour or it struck nine:
	&#145;I have a babe into my arms,
	He&#146;ll die nor nouricing.&#146;
64B.9	&#145;Goe home, go home, my son,&#146; she says,
	&#145;And mak thy Jenny blythe;
	If ae nurse winna sere her son,
	It&#146;s I&#146;ll provide him five.&#146;
64B.10	Fair Janet was nae weel lichter,
	Nor weel doun on her side,
	Till ben and cam her father dear,
	Saying, Wha will busk our bride?
64B.11	Ben and cam her brethren dear,
	Saying, Wha will busk our bride?
	And wha will saddle our bride&#146;s horse?
	Whom ahint will she ride?
64B.12	&#145;Hold your tongue, my brethren dear,
	And let your folly be,
	For I&#146;m sae fair and full of hair
	Sma busking will serve me.
64B.13	&#145;Hold your tongue, my brethren dear,
	And let your folly be,
	For I will ride behint William,
	He will best wait on me.
64B.14	&#145;Willie, lay the saddle saft,
	And lead the bridle soun,
	And when we come to Mary&#146;s Kirk,
	Ye&#146;ll set me hooly down.&#146;
64B.15	Supper scarslie was owre,
	Nor musick weel fa&#146;n to,
	Till ben and cam the bride&#146;s brethren,
	Saying, Bride, ye&#146;ll dance wi me:
	&#145;Awa, awa, my brethren dear,
	For dancing&#146;s no for me.&#146;
64B.16	Ben and came her ain bridegroom,
	Saying, Bride, ye&#146;ll dance wi me;
	She says, Awa, awa, ye southland dog,
	Your face I downa see.
64B.17	Ben and cam then Sweet Willie,
	Saying, Bride, ye&#146;ll dance wi me:
	&#145;Oh I will dance the floor once owre,
	Tho my heart should break in three.&#146;
64B.18	&#145;Oh no, oh no,&#146; said Sweet William,
	&#145;Let no such things eer be;
	But I will cut my glove in two,
	And I&#146;ll dance for thee and me.&#146;
64B.19	She hadna danced the floor once owre,
	I&#146;m sure she hadna thrice,
	Till she fell in a deadly swound,
	And from it neer did rise.
64B.20	Out and spak her ain bridegroom,
	And an angry man was he:
	&#145;This day she has gien me the gecks,
	Yet she must bear the scorn;
	There&#146;s not a bell in merry Linkum
	Shall ring for her the morn.&#146;
64B.21	Out and spoke then Sweet William,
	And a sorry man was he:
	&#145;Altho she has gien you the gecks,
	She will not bear the scorn;
	There&#146;s not a bell in merry Linkum
	But shall ring for her the morn.&#146;
64B.22	There was not a bell in merry Linkum
	But they tinkled and they rang,
	And a&#146; the birds that flew above,
	They changed their notes and sang.

	Or we&#146;ll sail to some bonie isle,
	Stands lanely midst the sea.&#146;
64C.4	But lang or ere the schip was built,
	Or deckd, or rigged out,
	Came sick a pain in Annet&#146;s back
	That down she coud na lout.
64C.5	&#145;Now, Willie, gif ye luve me weel,
	As sae it seems to me,

	And kissd her, cheik and chin;
	He&#146;s brocht her to her ain sweet bowr,
	But nae bowr-maid was in.
64C.7	&#145;Now leave my bower, Willie,&#146; she said,
	&#145;Now leave me to my lane;
	When she was travelling.&#146;
64C.8	He&#146;s stepped three steps down the stair,
	Upon the marble stane;
	Sae loud&#146;s he heard his young son&#146;s greet,
	But and his lady&#146;s mane!

	He&#146;s hied him to his mother&#146;s bower,
	By th&#146; ae light of the moon.
64C.11	And with him came the bold barone,
	And he spake up wi pride:
	&#145;Gar seek, gar seek the bower-maidens,
	Gar busk, gar busk the bryde.&#146;
64C.12	&#145;My maidens, easy with my back,
	And easy with my side;
	O set my saddle saft, Willie,
	I am a tender bryde.&#146;
64C.13	When she came to the burrow-town,
	They gied her a broch and ring,
	And when she came to . . .,

	And blinkit wi his ee:
	&#145;I trow this lady&#146;s born a bairn,&#146;
	Then laucht loud lauchters three.
64C.15	And up then spake the brisk bridegroom,
	And he spake up wi pryde:
	&#145;Gin I should pawn my wedding-gloves,
	I will dance wi the bryde.&#146;
64C.16	&#145;Now had your tongue, my lord,&#146; she said,
	&#145;Wi dancing let me be;
	I am sae thin in flesh and blude,
	Sma dancing will serve me.&#146;
64C.17	But she&#146;s taen Willie be the hand,
	The tear blinded her ee:
	&#145;But I wad dance wi my true-luve,
	But bursts my heart in three.&#146;
64C.18	She&#146;s taen her bracelet frae her arm,
	Her garter frae her knee:
	&#145;Gie that, gie that to my young son,
	He&#146;ll neer his mother see.&#146;

64D.1	&#145;IT never was my mother&#146;s fashion,
	As little will&#146;t be mine,
	For to hae gay lords within my room
	When ladies are travailing.&#146;

	When four and twenty knights and lords
	Came for the bride at last.

64F.2	&#145;Ye&#146;ll mount me quickly on a steed,
	A milk-white steed or gray,
	And carry me on to gude greenwood,
	Before that it be day.&#146;
64F.3	He mounted her upon a steed,
	He chose a steed o gray;
	He had her on to gude greenwood,
	Before that it was day.
64F.4	&#145;O will ye gang to the cards, Meggie?
	Or will ye gang wi me?
	Or will ye hae a bower-woman,
	To stay ere it be day?&#146;
64F.5	&#145;I winna gang to the cards,&#146; she said,
	&#145;Nor will I gae wi thee,
	Nor will I hae a bower-woman,
	To spoil my modestie.
64F.6	&#145;Ye&#146;ll gie me a lady at my back,
	An a lady me beforn,
	An a midwife at my twa sides,
	Till your young son be born.
64F.7	&#145;Ye&#146;ll do me up, and further up,
	To the top o yon greenwood tree;
	For every pain myself shall hae,
	The same pain ye maun drie.&#146;
64F.8	The first pain that did strike Sweet Willie,
	It was into the side;
	Then sighing sair said Sweet Willie,
	These pains are ill to bide!
64F.9	The nextan pain that strake Sweet Willie,
	It was into the back;
	Then sighing sair said Sweet Willie,
	These pains are women&#146;s wreck!
64F.10	The nextan pain that strake Sweet Willie,
	It was into the head;
	Then sighing sair said Sweet Willie,
	I fear my lady&#146;s dead!
64F.11	Then he&#146;s gane on, and further on,
	At the foot o yon greenwood tree;
	There he got his lady lighter,
	Wi his young son on her knee.
64F.12	Then he&#146;s taen up his little young son,
	And kissd him, cheek and chin,
	And he is on to his mother,
	As fast as he could gang.
64F.13	&#145;Ye will take in my son, mother,
	Gie him to nurses nine;
	Three to wauk, and three to sleep,
	And three to fanf between.&#146;
64F.14	Then he has left his mother&#146;s house,
	And frae her he has gane,
	And he is back to his lady,
	And safely brought her hame.
64F.15	Then in it came her father dear,
	Was belted in a brand:
	&#145;It&#146;s nae time for brides to lye in bed,
	When the bridegroom&#146;s send&#146;s in town.
64F.16	&#145;There are four-and-twenty noble lords
	A&#146; lighted on the green;
	The fairest knight amang them a&#146;,
	He must be your bridegroom.&#146;
64F.17	&#145;O wha will shoe my foot, my foot?
	And wha will glove my hand?
	And wha will prin my sma middle,
	Wi the short prin and the lang?&#146;
64F.18	Now out it speaks him Sweet Willie,
	Who knew her troubles best:
	&#145;It is my duty for to serve,
	As I&#146;m come here as guest.
64F.19	&#145;Now I will shoe your foot, Maisry,
	And I will glove your hand,
	And I will prin your sma middle,
	Wi the sma prin and the lang.&#146;
64F.20	&#145;Wha will saddle my steed,&#146; she says,
	&#145;And gar my bridle ring?
	And wha will hae me to gude church-door,
	This day I&#146;m ill abound?&#146;
64F.21	&#145;I will saddle your steed, Maisry,
	And gar your bridle ring,
	And I&#146;ll hae you to gude church-door,
	And safely set you down.&#146;
64F.22	&#145;O healy, healy take me up,
	And healy set me down,
	And set my back until a wa,
	My foot to yird-fast stane.&#146;
64F.23	He healy took her frae her horse,
	And healy set her down,
	And set her back until a wa,
	Her foot to yird-fast stane.
64F.24	When they had eaten and well drunken,
	And a&#146; had thornd fine,
	The bride&#146;s father he took the cup,
	For to serve out the wine.
64F.25	Out it speaks the bridegroom&#146;s brother,
	An ill death mat he die!
	&#145;I fear our bride she&#146;s born a bairn,
	Or else has it a dee.&#146;
64F.26	She&#146;s taen out a Bible braid,
	And deeply has she sworn;
	&#145;If I hae born a bairn,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Sin yesterday at morn,
64F.27	&#145;Or if I&#146;ve born a bairn,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Sin yesterday at noon,
	There&#146;s nae a lady amang you a&#146;
	That woud been here sae soon.&#146;
64F.28	Then out it spake the bridegroom&#146;s man,
	Mischance come ower his heel!
	&#145;Win up, win up, now bride,&#146; he says,
	&#145;And dance a shamefu reel.&#146;
64F.29	Then out it speaks the bride hersell,
	And a sorry heart had she:
	&#145;Is there nae ane amang you a&#146;
	Will dance this dance for me?&#146;
64F.30	Then out it speaks him Sweet Willie,
	And he spake aye thro pride:
	&#145;O draw my boots for me, bridegroom,
	Or I dance for your bride.&#146;
64F.31	Then out it spake the bride hersell:
	O na, this maunna be;
	For I will dance this dance mysell,
	Tho my back shoud gang in three.
64F.32	She hadna well gane thro the reel,
	Nor yet well on the green,
	Till she fell down at Willie&#146;s feet
	As cauld as ony stane.
64F.33	He&#146;s taen her in his arms twa,
	And haed her up the stair;
	Then up it came her jolly bridegroom,
	Says, What&#146;s your business there?
64F.34	Then Willie lifted up his foot,
	And dang him down the stair,
	And brake three ribs o the bridegroom&#146;s side,
	And a word he spake nae mair.
64F.35	Nae meen was made for that lady,
	When she was lying dead;
	But a&#146; was for him Sweet Willie,
	On the fields for he ran mad.

64G.1	&#145;WILL you marry the southland lord,
	A queen of fair England to be?
	Or will you burn for Sweet Willie,
	The morn upon yon lea?&#146;
64G.2	&#145;I will marry the southland lord,
	Father, sen it is your will;
	But I&#146;d rather it were my burial-day,
	For my grave I&#146;m going till.
64G.3	&#145;O go, O go now, my bower-wife,
	O go now hastilie,

64G.4	And he is to his mother&#146;s bower,
	As fast as he could rin:
	&#145;Open, open, my mother dear,
	Open, and let me in.
64G.5	&#145;For the rain rains on my yellow hair,
	The dew stands on my chin,
	And I have something in my lap,
	And I wad fain be in.&#146;
64G.6	&#145;O go, O go now, Sweet Willie,
	And make your lady blithe,
	For wherever you had ae nourice,

	An she spak a word o&#146; pride;
	Says, Whare is a&#146; our bride&#146;s maidens,

64G.8	&#145;O haud your tongue, my mother dear,
	Your speaking let it be,
	For I&#146;m sae fair and full o flesh
	Little busking will serve me.&#146;

64G.11	And Willie swore a great, great oath,
	And he swore by the thorn,

	As the night that she was born.
64G.12	&#145;Ye hae gien me the gowk, Annet,

	Sae loud&#146;s I hear you lie!
	There&#146;s no a bell in a&#146; the town
	But shall ring for Annet and me.
