	 Nor with anie Scotch lord;
	 But he&#146;s sent it with the noblest knight
	 Eer Scotland could afford.

208B.1	 THE king he wrote a love-letter,
	 And he sealed it up with gold,
	 And he sent it to Lord Derwentwater,
	 For to read it if he could.
208B.2	 The first two lines that he did read,
	 They made him for to smile;
	 But the next two lines he looked upon
	 Made the tears from his eyes to fall.
208B.3	 &#145;Oh,&#146; then cried out his lady fair,
	 As she in child-bed lay,
	 &#145;Make your will, make your will, Lord Derwentwater,
	 Before that you go away.&#146;
208B.4	 &#145;Then here&#146;s for thee, my lady fair,
	 . . . .
	 A thousand pounds of beaten gold,
	 To lead you a lady&#146;s life.&#146;
208B.5	 . . . .
	 . .  his milk-white steed,
	 The ring dropt from his little finger,
	 And his nose it began to bleed.
208B.6	 He rode, and he rode, and he rode along,
	 Till he came to Westminster Hall,
	 Where all the lords of England&#146;s court
	 A traitor did him call.
208B.7	 &#145;Oh, why am I a traitor?&#146; said he;
	 &#145;Indeed, I am no such thing;
	 I have fought the battles valiantly
	 Of James, our noble king.&#146;
208B.8	 O then stood up an old gray-headed man,
	 With a pole-axe in his hand:
	 &#145;&#146;Tis your head, &#146;tis your head, Lord Derwentwater,
	 &#146;Tis your head that I demand.&#146;
208B.9	 . . . .
	 His eyes with weeping sore,
	 He laid his head upon the block,
	 And words spake never more.

208E.1	 THE king wrote a letter to my lord Derwentwater,
	 And he sealed it with gold;
	 He sent it to my Lord Derwentwater,
	 To read it if he could.
208E.2	 He sent it by no boy,
	 He sent it by no slave,
	 But he sent it by as true a knight
	 As heart could wish or have.
208E.3	 The very first line that he looked upon
	 Made him for to laugh and to smile;
	 The very next line that he looked upon,
	 The tears from his eyes did fall.
208E.4	 He called to his stable-boy
	 To saddle his bonny grey steed,
	 &#145;That I unto loving London
	 May ride away with speed.&#146;
208E.5	 &#145;His wife heard him say so,
	 In childbed as she lay;
	 Says she, &#145;My lord Derwentwater,
	 Make thy will before thou goest away.&#146;
208E.6	 &#145;It&#146;s to my little son I give

208E.7	 &#145;And unto thee, my lady gay,

208E.8	 He set his foot in the level stirrup,
	 And mounted his bonny grey steed;
	 The gold rings from his fingers did break,
	 And his nose began for to bleed.
208E.9	 He had not ridden past a mile or two,
	 When his horse stumbled over a stone;
	 &#145;These are tokens enough,&#146; said my lord Derwentwater,
	 &#145;That I shall never return.&#146;
208E.10	 He rode and he rode till he came to merry London,

208F.1	 THE king has written a broad letter,
	 And seald it with his hand,
	 And sent it on to Lord Arnwaters,
	 To read and understand.
208F.2	 Now he has sent it by no boy,
	 No boy, nor yet a slave,
	 But one of England&#146;s fairest knights,
	 The one that he would have.
208F.3	 When first he on the letter lookd,
	 Then he began to smile;
	 But ere he read it to an end,
	 The tears did trickling fall.
208F.4	 He calld upon his saddle-groom
	 To saddle his milk-white steed,
	 &#145;For I unto London must go,
	 For me there is much need.&#146;
208F.5	 Out then speaks his gay lady,
	 In child-bed where she lay:
	 &#145;Make your will, make your will, my knight,
	 For fear ye rue the day.&#146;
208F.6	 &#145;I&#146;ll leave unto my eldest son
	 My houses and my lands;
	 I&#146;ll leave unto my youngest son
	 Full forty thousand pounds.
208F.7	 &#145;I&#146;ll leave unto my gay lady,
	 And to my loving wife,
	 The second part of my estate,
	 To maintain a lady&#146;s life.&#146;
208F.8	 He kissd her on the pillow soft,
	 In child-bed where she lay,
	 And bade farewell, neer to return,
	 Unto his lady gay.
208F.9	 He put his foot in the stirup,
	 His nose began to bleed;
	 The ring from &#146;s finger burst in two
	 When he mounted on his steed.
208F.10	 He had not rode a mile or two
	 Till his horse stumbled down;
	 &#145;A token good,&#146; said Lord Arnwaters,
	 &#145;I&#146;ll never reach London town.&#146;
208F.11	 But when into Westminster Hall,
	 Amongst the nobles all,
	 &#145;A traitor, a traitor, Lord Arnwaters,
	 A traitor,&#146; they did him call.
208F.12	 &#145;A traitor? a traitor how call ye me?
	 And a traitor how can I be
	 For keeping seven thousand valiant men
	 To fight for  brave Jamie?&#146;
208F.13	 Up then came a brave old man,
	 With a broad ax in his hand:
	 &#145;Your life, your life, Lord Arnwaters,
	 Your life&#146;s at my command.&#146;
208F.14	 &#145;My life, my life, my brave old man,
	 My life I&#146;ll give to thee,
	 And the coat of green that&#146;s on my back
	 You shall have for your fee.
208F.15	 &#145;There&#146;s fifty pounds in one pocket,
	 Pray deal&#146;t among the poor;
	 There&#146;s fifty and four in the other pocket,
	 Pray deal&#146;t from door to door.
208F.16	 &#145;There&#146;s one thing more I have to say,
	 This day before I die;
	 To beg the lords and nobles all
	 To be kind to my lady.&#146;

	 And seal d it with gold,
	 And sent it to Lor Derwentwater,
	 To read it if he could.
208H.2	 The first three lines he looked upon,

	 Made tears fall from his eyes.
208H.3	 O then bespoke his gay lady,

	 For he must to London go,
	 The king had sent indeed.
208H.7	 When he put his foot in the stirrup,
	 To mount his grey steed,
	 His gold ring from his finger burst,
	 And his nose began to bleed.
208H.8	 He had not gone but half a mile
	 When it began to rain;
	 &#145;Now this is a token,&#146; his lordship said,
	 &#145;That I shall not return again.&#146;
208H.9	 When he unto London came,
	 A mob did at him rise,
	 And they call d him a traitor,
	 Made the tears fall from his eyes.
208H.10	 &#145;A traitor, a traitor!&#146; his lordship said,
	 . . . .
	 Is it for keeping eight score men
	 To fight for pretty Jimmee?&#146;
208H.11	 O then bespoke a grave man,
	 With a broad axe in his hand:
	 &#145;Hold your tongue, Lord Derwentwater,
	 Your life lies at my command.&#146;
208H.12	 &#145;My life, my life,&#146; his lordship said,

208I.1	 KING GEORGE he did a letter write,
	 And sealed it up with gold,
	 And sent it to Lord Derwentwater,
	 To read it if he could.
208I.2	 He sent his letter by no post,
	 He sent it by no page,
	 But sent it by a gallant knight
	 As eer did combat wage.
208I.3	 The first line that my lord lookd on
	 Struck him with strong surprise;
	 The second, more alarming still,
	 Made tears fall from his eyes.
208I.4	 He called up his stable-groom,
	 Saying, Saddle me well my steed,
	 For I must up to London go,
	 Of me there seems great need.
208I.5	 His lady, hearing what he said,
	 As she in child-bed lay,
	 Cry&#146;d, My dear lord, pray make your will
	 Before you go away.
208I.6	 &#145;I&#146;ll leave to thee, my eldest son,
	 My houses and my land;
	 I&#146;ll leave to thee, my younger son,
	 Ten thousand pounds in hand.
208I.7	 &#145;I&#146;ll leave to thee, my lady gay,
	 My lawful married wife,
	 A third part of my whole estate,
	 To keep thee a lady&#146;s life.&#146;
208I.8	 He knelt him down by her bed-side,
	 And kissed her lips so sweet;
	 The words that passd, alas! presaged
	 They never more should meet.
208I.9	 Again he calld his stable-groom,
	 Saying, Bring me out my steed,
	 For I must up to London go,
	 With instant haste and speed.
208I.10	 He took the reins into his hand,
	 Which shook with fear and dread;
	 The rings from off his fingers dropt,
	 His nose gushd out and bled.
208I.11	 He had but ridden miles two or three
	 When stumbling fell his steed;
	 &#145;Ill omens these,&#146; Derwentwater said,
	 &#145;That I for James must bleed.&#146;
208I.12	 As he rode up Westminster street,
	 In sight of the White Hall,
	 The lords and ladies of London town
	 A traitor they did him call.
208I.13	 &#145;A traitor!&#146; Lord Derwentwater said,
	 &#145;A traitor how can I be,
	 Unless for keeping five hundred men
	 Fighting for King Jemmy?&#146;
208I.14	 Then started forth a grave old man,
	 With a broad-mouthd axe in hand:
	 &#145;Thy head, thy head, Lord Derwentwater,
	 Thy head&#146;s at my command.&#146;
208I.15	 &#145;My head, my head, thou grave old man,
	 My head I will give thee;
	 Here&#146;s a coat of velvet on my back
	 Will surely pay thy fee.
208I.16	 &#145;But give me leave,&#146; Derwentwater said,
	 &#145;To speak words two or three;
	 Ye lords and ladies of London town,
	 Be kind to my lady.
208I.17	 &#145;Here&#146;s a purse of fifty sterling pounds,
	 Pray give it to the poor;
	 Here&#146;s one of forty-five beside
	 You may dole from door to door.&#146;
208I.18	 He laid his head upon the block,
	 The axe was sharp and strong,
	 . . . .
