	 The people fell a mourning,
	 And a council held amo them a&#146;,
	 But sair, sair wept Kinmundy.

	 And straightway ran to Gamery.

	 Till she was wet and weary;
	 And in the middle part o it,
	 There she got her deary.
215E.17	 Then she stroakd back his yellow hair,
	 And kissd his mou sae comely:
	 &#145;My mother&#146;s heart&#146;s be as wae as thine!

215H.1	 THEY were saddled a&#146;, they were briddled a&#146;,
	 Bridegroom and a&#146; was ready;
	 &#145;Stop,&#146; says he, &#146;My nobles a&#146;,
	 For I&#146;ve left something behind me.
215H.2	 &#145;It is your blessing, mother dear,
	 To bound [to] the bride-styl with me:&#146;
	 &#145;God&#146;s blessing now, my son,&#146; says she,
	 &#145;And mine and a&#146; gang wi ye!
215H.3	 &#145;For ye are scarce nineteen years of age
	 When ye met in wi bonny Maggie,
	 And I&#146;m sure, my dear, she&#146;ll welcome you
	 This day in the kirk o Gemrie.&#146;
215H.4	 It&#146;s they have ridden up, it&#146;s they have ridden down,
	 And joy was in their gallant company;
	 It&#146;s they have ridden up, and they have ridden down,
	 Till they came to the water o Gemrie.
215H.5	 When they came to the water, it was flooded;
	 In the middle Sweet William he fell;
	 The spray brook over his horse&#146;s mane,
	 And the wind sang his funeral knell.
215H.6	 &#145;O much is the pity! O much is the pity!&#146;
	 Cried that joyful company;
	 &#145;O much is the pity! O much is the pity!&#146;
	 But alas! now are woeful and wae.
215H.7	 Hame and hame came his stead,
	 And ran to its ain stable;
	 They&#146;ve gien it corn and hay to eat,
	 As much as it was able.
215H.8	 His mother she was a waefu woman,
	 As dung as woman could be;
	 &#145;My son,&#146; says she, &#146;is either hurt or slain,
	 Or drowned in the waters of Gemrie.&#146;
215H.9	 It&#146;s up and spak her daughter Ann:
	 &#145;What needs be a&#146; this mourning?
	 He&#146;s lighted at yon bonny kirk-style,
	 And his steed has run away from him.&#146;
215H.10	 &#145;O had yer tongue, my daughter Ann,
	 Nor scold na me about mourning;
	 Hadna my son there men enew
	 To hae taken his steed from him?&#146;
215H.11	 They&#146;ve ridden up, they&#146;ve ridden down,
	 Till they came to the kirk o Gemrie;
	 There they saw his winsome bride,
	 Alone at the kirk-style standing.
215H.12	 &#145;Where away is the man,&#146; says she,
	 &#145;That promised me fair wedding?
	 This day he vowd to meet me here,
	 But O he&#146;s lang o coming!&#146;
215H.13	 Up and spak his brother John,
	 Says, &#145;Meg, I&#146;ll tell ye plainly;
	 The stream was strang, and we rade wrang,
	 And he&#146;s drownd in the water o Gemrie.&#146;
215H.14	 She&#146;s torn the ribons frae her hair,
	 That were baith thick and many;
	 She&#146;s torn them a&#146;, lettin them fa&#146;,
	 And she&#146;s away to the waters o Gemrie.
215H.15	 She[&#146;s] sought him up, she&#146;s sought him down,
	 Until that she&#146;s gotten his body,
	 And she&#146;s laid it on the green, green grass,
	 And flung her mantle oer him.
215H.16	 &#145;O Willie was red, but O now he&#146;s white!
	 And Willie was wondrous bonny,
	 And Willie said he&#146;d marry me,
	 Gin ere he married oney.
215H.17	 &#145;He was red, he was white, he was my delight,
	 And aye, aye I thought him bonny;
	 But now since Willie has dy&#146;d for me,
	 I will sleep wi him in the same grave at Gemrie.&#146;
