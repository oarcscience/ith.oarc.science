65B.1	IN came her sister,
	Stepping on the floor;
	Says, It&#146;s telling me, my sister Janet,
	That you&#146;re become a whore.
65B.2	&#145;A whore, sister, a whore, sister?
	That&#146;s what I&#146;ll never be;
	I&#146;m no so great a whore, sister,
	As liars does on me lee.
65B.3	In came her brother,
	Stepping on the floor;
	Says, It&#146;s telling me, my sister Janet,
	That you&#146;re become a whore.&#146;
65B.4	&#145;A whore, brother, a whore, brother?
	A whore I&#146;ll never be;
	I&#146;m no so bad a woman, brother,
	As liears does on me lee.&#146;
65B.5	In came her mother,
	Stepping on the floor:
	&#145;They are telling me, my daughter,
	That you&#146;re so soon become a whore.&#146;
65B.6	&#145;A whore, mother, a whore, mother?
	A whore I&#146;ll never be;
	I&#146;m only with child to an English lord,
	Who promised to marry me.&#146;
65B.7	In came her father,
	Stepping on the floor;
	Says, They tell me, my daughter Janet,
	That you are become a whore.&#146;
65B.8	&#145;A whore, father, a whore, father?
	A whore I&#146;ll never be;
	I&#146;m but with child to an English lord,
	Who promisd to marry me.&#146;
65B.9	Then in it came an old woman,
	The lady&#146;s nurse was she,
	And ere she could get out a word
	The tear blinded her ee.
65B.10	&#145;Your father&#146;s to the fire, Janet,
	Your brother&#146;s to the whin;
	All for to kindle a bold bonfire,
	To burn your body in.&#146;
65B.11	&#145;Where will I get a boy,&#146; she said,
	&#145;Will gain gold for his fee,
	That would run unto fair England
	For thy good lord to thee.&#146;
65B.12	&#145;O I have here a boy,&#146; she said,
	&#145;Will gain gold to his fee,
	For he will run to fair England
	For thy good lord to thee.&#146;
65B.13	Now when he found a bridge broken,
	He bent his bow and swam,
	And when he got where grass did grow,
	He slacked it and ran.
65B.14	And when he came to that lord&#146;s gate,
	Stopt not to knock or call,
	But set his bent bow to his breast
	And lightly leapt the wall;
	And ere the porter could open the gate,
	The boy was in the hall,
65B.15	In presence of that noble lord,
	And fell down on his knee:
	&#145;What is it, my boy,&#146; he cried,
	&#145;Have you brought unto me?
65B.16	&#145;Is my building broke into?
	Or is my towers won?
	Or is my true-love delivered
	Of daughter or of son?&#146;
65B.17	&#145;Your building is not broke,&#146; he cried,
	&#145;Nor is your towers won,
	Nor is your true-love delivered
	Of daughter nor of son;
	But if you do not come in haste,
	Be sure she will be gone.
65B.18	&#145;Her father is gone to the fire,
	Her brother to the whin,
	To kindle up a bold bonfire,
	To burn her body in.&#146;
65B.19	&#145;Go saddle to me the black,&#146; he cried,
	&#145;And do it very soon;
	Get unto me the swiftest horse
	That ever rade from the town.&#146;
65B.20	The first horse that he rade upon,
	For he was raven black,
	He bore him far, and very far,
	But failed in a slack.
65B.21	The next horse that he rode upon,
	He was a bonny brown;
	He bore him far, and very far,
	But did at last fall down.
65B.22	The next horse that he rode upon,
	He as the milk was white;
	Fair fall the mare that foaled that foal.
	Took him to Janet&#146;s sight!
65B.23	And boots and spurs, all as he was,
	Into the fire he lap,
	Got one kiss of her comely mouth,
	While her body gave a crack.
65B.24	&#145;O who has been so bold,&#146; he says,
	&#145;This bonfire to set on?
	Or who has been so bold,&#146; he says,
	&#145;Her body for to burn?&#146;
65B.25	&#145;O here are we,&#146; her brother said,
	&#145;This bonfire who set on;
	And we have been so bold,&#146; he said,
	&#145;Her body for to burn.&#146;
65B.26	&#145;O I&#146;ll cause burn for you, Janet,
	Your father and your mother;
	And I&#146;ll cause die for you, Janet,
	Your sister and your brother.
65B.27	&#145;And I&#146;ll cause mony back be bare,
	And mony shed be thin,
	And mony wife be made a widow,
	And mony ane want their son.&#146;

65C.1	BEN came to her father dear,
	Stepping upon the floor;
	Says, It&#146;s told me, my daughter Janet,
	That you&#146;re now become a whore.
65C.2	&#145;A whore, father, a whore, father?
	That&#146;s what I&#146;ll never be,
	Tho I am with bairn to an English lord,

	Fair fall the mare that foaled the foal
	Took him to Janet&#146;s lyke!
65C.17	But boots and spurs, all as he was,
	Into the fire he lap,
	Took ae kiss of her comely mouth,
	While her body gave a crack.

65C.19	Her father cried, I&#146;ve been so bold

	Her brother cried, We&#146;ve been so bold
	Her body for to burn.
65C.20	&#145;Oh I shall hang for you, Janet,
	Your father and your brother;
	And I shall burn for you, Janet,
	Your sister and your mother.
65C.21	&#145;Oh I shall make many bed empty,
	And many shed be thin,
	And many a wife to be a widow,
	And many one want their son.
65C.22	&#145;Then I shall take a cloak of cloth,
	A staff made of the wand,

	&#145;Often have I gane your errands, madam,
	But now it is time to rin.&#146;
65D.12	O when he came to Strawberry Castle,

	And his nose began to bleed.
65D.18	He bursted fifteen gude stout steeds,
	And four o them were dappled gray,
	And the little foot-page ran aye before,
	Crying, Mend it, an ye may!
65D.19	When he came to the bale-fire,
	He lighted wi a glent,
	Wi black boots and clean spurs,

	What never was done for nane;
	I&#146;ll make many lady lemanless,
	And many a clothing thin.

65E.18	But when he came into the place,
	He lap unto the wa;
	He thought to get a kiss o her bonny lips,
	But her body fell in twa.
65E.19	&#145;Oh vow, oh vow, oh vow,&#146; he said,
	&#145;Oh vow but ye&#146;ve been cruel!
	Ye&#146;ve taken the timber out of my own wood
	And burnt my ain dear jewel.
65E.20	&#145;Now for thy sake, Lady Marjorie,
	I&#146;ll burn both father and mother;
	And for thy sake, Lady Marjorie,
	I&#146;ll burn both sister and brother.
65E.21	&#145;And for thy sake, Lady Marjorie,
	I&#146;ll burn both kith and kin;

	&#145;MY father was the first good man
	Who tied me to a stake;
	My mother was the first good woman
	Who did the fire make.
65G.2	&#145;My brother was the next good man
	Who did the fire fetch;
	My sister was the next good woman
	Who lighted it with a match.
65G.3	&#145;They blew the fire, they kindled the fire,
	Till it did reach my knee:
	"[O mother, mother, quench the fire!
	The smoke will smother me."]
65G.4	&#145;O had I but my little foot-page,
	My errand he would run;
	He would run unto gay London,
	And bid my lord come home.&#146;
65G.5	Then there stood by her sister&#146;s child,
	Her own dear sister&#146;s son:
	&#145;O many an errand I&#146;ve run for thee,
	And but this one I&#146;ll run.&#146;
65G.6	He ran, where the bridge was broken down
	He bent his bow and swam;
	He swam till he came to the good green turf,
	He up on his feet and ran.
65G.7	He ran till he came at his uncle&#146;s hall;
	His uncle sat at his meat:

	How little would you eat!&#146;
65G.8	&#145;O is my castle broken down,

65G.10	&#145;But she has sent you a gay gold ring,
	With a posy round the rim,
	To know, if you have any love for her,
	You&#146;ll come to her burning.&#146;
65G.11	He called down his merry men all,
	By one, by two, by three;
	He mounted on his milk-white steed,
	To go to Margery.
65G.12	They blew the fire, they kindled the fire,
	Till it did reach her head:
	&#145;O mother, mother, quench the fire!
	For I am nearly dead.&#146;
65G.13	She turned her head on her left shoulder,
	Saw her girdle hang on the tree:

65H.1	THERE stands a stane in wan water,
	It&#146;s lang ere it grew green;
	Lady Maisry sits in her bower door,
	Sewing at her silken seam.
65H.2	Word&#146;s gane to her mother&#146;s kitchen,
	And to her father&#146;s ha,
	That Lady Maisry is big wi bairn-+-
	And her true-love&#146;s far awa.
65H.3	When her brother got word of this,
	Then fiercely looked he:
	&#145;Betide me life, betide me death,
	At Maisry&#146;s bower I&#146;se be.

65H.5	When he came to Maisry&#146;s bower,
	He turnd him round about,
	And at a little shott-window,
	He saw her peeping out.
65H.6	&#145;Gude morrow, gude morrow, Lady Maisry,

	&#145;Gude morrow, gude morrow, my brother dear,

	Was ance for you too side?
	And what&#146;s become o your lang stays,
	Was ance for you too wide?&#146;
65H.8	&#145;O he that made my claithing short,
	I hope he&#146;ll make them side;
	And he that made my stays narrow,
	I hope he&#146;ll make them wide.&#146;
65H.9	&#145;O is it to a lord o might,
	Or baron o high degree?
	Or is it to any o your father&#146;s boys,
	Rides in the chase him wi?&#146;
65H.10	&#145;It&#146;s no to any Scottish lord,
	Nor baron o high degree;
	But English James, that little prince,
	That has beguiled me.&#146;
65H.11	&#145;O was there not a Scots baron
	That could hae fitted thee,
	That thus you&#146;ve lovd an Englishman,
	And has affronted me?&#146;
65H.12	She turnd her right and round about,
	The tear blinded her ee:
	&#145;What is the wrang I&#146;ve done, brother,
	Ye look sae fierce at me?&#146;
65H.13	&#145;Will ye forsake that English blude,
	When your young babe is born?&#146;
	&#145;I&#146;ll nae do that, my brother dear,
	Tho I shoud be forlorn.&#146;
65H.14	&#145;I&#146;se cause a man put up the fire,
	Anither ca in the stake,
	And on the head o yon high hill
	I&#146;ll burn you for his sake.
65H.15	&#145;O where are all my wall-wight men,
	That I pay meat and fee,
	For to hew down baith thistle and thorn,
	To burn that lady wi?&#146;
65H.16	Then he has taen her, Lady Maisry,
	And fast he has her bound;
	And he causd the fiercest o his men
	Drag her frae town to town.
65H.17	Then he has causd ane of his men
	Hew down baith thistle and thorn;
	She carried the peats in her petticoat-lap,
	Her ainsell for to burn.
65H.18	Then ane pat up this big bauld fire,
	Anither ca&#146;d in the stake;
	It was to burn her Lady Maisry,
	All for her true-love&#146;s sake.
65H.19	But it fell ance upon a day,
	Prince James he thought full lang;
	He minded on the lady gay
	He left in fair Scotland.
65H.20	&#145;O where will I get a little wee boy,
	Will win gowd to his fee,
	That will rin on to Adam&#146;s high tower,
	Bring tidings back to me?&#146;
65H.21	&#145;O here am I, a little wee boy,

	And he is back to his master,
	As fast as gang coud he.

	&#145;Bad news, bad news, my master dear,
	Bad news, as ye will see.&#146;
65H.25	&#145;Are ony o my biggins brunt, my boy?
	Or ony o my towers won?
	Or is my lady lighter yet,
	O dear daughter or son?&#146;
65H.26	&#145;There&#146;s nane o your biggins brunt, master,
	Nor nane o your towers won,
	Nor is your lady lighter yet,

65H.27	&#145;There&#146;s an has been [put up] a big bauld fire,
	Anither ca&#146;d in the stake,

65H.28	&#145;Gae saddle to me the black, the black,
	Gae saddle to me the brown;
	Gae saddle to me the swiftest steed,
	To hae me to the town.&#146;
65H.29	Ere he was three miles near the town,
	She heard his horse-foot patt:
	&#145;Mend up the fire, my fause brother,
	It scarce comes to my pap.&#146;
65H.30	Ere he was twa miles near the town,
	She heard his bridle ring:
	&#145;Mend up the fire, my fause brother,
	It scarce comes to my chin.
65H.31	&#145;But look about, my fause brother,
	Ye see not what I see;
	I see them coming here, or lang
	Will mend the fire for thee.&#146;
65H.32	Then up it comes him little Prince James,
	And fiercely looked he:
	&#145;I&#146;se make my love&#146;s words very true
	She said concerning me.
65H.33	&#145;O wha has been sae bauld,&#146; he said,
	&#145;As put this bonfire on?
	And wha has been sae bauld,&#146; he said,
	&#145;As put that lady in?&#146;
65H.34	Then out it spake her brother then,
	He spoke right furiouslie;
	Says, I&#146;m the man that put her in:
	Wha dare hinder me?
65H.35	&#145;If my hands had been loose,&#146; she said,
	&#145;As they are fastly bound,
	I woud hae looted me to the ground,
	Gien you up your bonny young son.&#146;
65H.36	&#145;I will burn, for my love&#146;s sake,
	Her father and her mother;
	And I will burn, for my love&#146;s sake,
	Her sister and her brother.
65H.37	&#145;And I will burn, for my love&#146;s sake,
	The whole o a&#146; her kin;
	And I will burn, for my love&#146;s sake,
	Thro Linkum and thro Lin.
65H.38	&#145;And mony a bed will I make toom,
	And bower will I make thin;
	And mony a babe shall thole the fire,
	For I may enter in.&#146;
65H.39	Great meen was made for Lady Maisry,
	On that hill whare she was slain;
	But mair was for her ain true-love,

65[K.9]	&#145;There&#146;s nane o a&#146; yer brigs broken,
	Ther&#146;s nane of your castles win;
	But the fairest lady in a&#146; your land
	This day for you will burn.&#146;
65[K.10]	&#145;Gar saddle me the black, black horse,
	Gar saddle me the brown,
	Gar saddle me the swiftest stead
	That eer carried man to town.&#146;
65[K.11]	He&#146;s burstit the black unto the slack,
	The grey unto the brae,
	An ay the page that ran afore
	Cried, Ride, sir, an ye may.
65[K.12]	Her father kindlet the bale-fire,
	Her brother set the stake,
	Her mother sat an saw her burn,
	An never cired Alack!
65[K.13]	&#145;Beet on, beet [on], my cruel father,
	For you I cound nae friend;
	But for fifteen well mete mile
	I&#146;ll hear my love&#146;s bridle ring.&#146;
65[K.14]	When he cam to the bonnie Dundee,
	He lightit wi a glent;
	Wi jet-black boots an glittrin spurs
	Through that bale-fire he went.
65[K.15]	He thought his love wad hae datit him,
	But she was dead an gane;
	He was na sae wae for the lady
	As he was for her yong son.
65[K.16]	&#145;But I&#146;ll gar burn for you, Marjorie,
	Yer father an yer mother,
	An I&#146;ll gar burn for you, Marjorie,
	Your sister an your brother.
65[K.17]	&#145;An I will burn for you, Marjorie,
	The town that ye&#146;r brunt in,
	An monie ane&#146;s be fatherless
	That has but little sin.&#146;
