# 170A: The Death of Queen Jane

         O women, O women, as women ye be,
         Rip open my two sides, and save my baby!
    170A.2   O royal Queen Jane, that thing may not be;
         Well send for King Henry to come unto thee.
         King Henry came to her, and sate on her bed:
         What ails my dear lady, her eyes look so red?
    170A.3   O royal King Henry, do one thing for me:
         Rip open my two sides, and save my baby!
         O royal Queen Jane, that thing will not do;
         If I lose your fair body, Ill lose your baby too.
    170A.4   She wept and she waild, and she wrung her hands sore;
         O the flour of England must flurish no more!
         She wept and she waild till she fell in a swoond,
         They opend her two sides, and the baby was found.
    170A.5   The baby was christened with joy and much mirth,
         Whilst poor Queen Janes body lay cold under earth:
         There was ringing and singing and mourning all day,
         The princess Eliz[abeth] went weeping away.
    170A.6   The trumpets in mourning so sadly did sound,

         But royal King Henry went weeping away.
    170B.8   O black were their stockings, and black were their bands,
         And black were the weapons they held in their hands;
         O black were their mufflers, and black were their shoes,
         And black were the cheverons they drew on their luves.
    170B.9   They mourned in the kitchen, and they mournd in the ha,
