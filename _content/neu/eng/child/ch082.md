    82.1    THERE was a knight, in a summers night,
        Was riding oer the lee, diddle
        An there he saw a bonny birdy,
        Was singing upon a tree. diddle
    82.1b   O wow for day! diddle
        An dear gin it were day! diddle
        Gin it were day, an gin I were away!
        For I ha na lang time to stay. diddle
    82.2    Make hast, make hast, ye gentle knight,
        What keeps you here so late?
        Gin ye kent what was doing at hame,
        I fear you woud look blate.
    82.3    O what needs I toil day an night,
        My fair body to kill,
        Whan I hae knights at my comman,
        An ladys at my will?
    82.4    Ye lee, ye lee, ye gentle knight,
        Sa louds I hear you lee;
        Your ladys a knight in her arms twa
        That she lees far better nor the.
    82.5    Ye lee, you lee, you bonny birdy,
        How you lee upo my sweet!
        I will tak out my bonny bow,
        An in troth I will you sheet.
    82.6    But afore ye hae your bow well bent,
        An a your arrows yare,
        I will flee till another tree,
        Whare I can better fare.
    82.7    O whare was you gotten, and whare was ye clecked?
        My bonny birdy, tell me:
        O I was clecked in good green wood,
        My bonny birdy, tell me:
        O I was clecked in good green wood,
        Intill a holly tree;
        A gentleman my nest herryed,
        An ga me to his lady.
    82.8    Wi good white bread an farrow-cow milk
        He bade her feed me aft,
        An ga her a little wee simmer-dale wanny,
        To ding me sindle and saft.
    82.9    Wi good white bread an farrow-cow milk
        I wot she fed me nought,
        But wi a little wee simmer-dale wanny
        She dang me sair an aft:
        Gin she had deen as ye her bade,
        I woudna tell how she has wrought.
    82.10   The knight he rade, and the birdy flew,
        The live-lang simmers night,
        Till he came till his ladys bowr-door,
        Then even down he did light:
        The birdy sat on the crap of a tree,
        An I wot it sang fu dight.
    82.11b  O wow for day! diddle
        An dear gin it were day! diddle
        Gin it were day, an gin I were away!
        For I ha na lang time to stay. diddle
    82.12   What needs ye lang for day, diddle.
        An wish that you were away? diddle
        Is no your hounds i my cellar,
        Eating white meal an gray? diddle
    82.12b  O wow, etc.
    82.13   Is nae your steed in my stable,
        Eating good corn an hay?
        An is nae your hawk i my perch-tree,
        Just perching for his prey?
        An is nae yoursel i my arms twa?
        Then how can ye lang for day?
    82.14b  O wow for day! diddle
        An dear gin it were day! diddle
    ??  O wow for day! diddle
        An dear gin it were day! diddle
    ??  O wow for day! diddle
        An dear gin it were day! diddle
        For he thats in bed wi anither mans wife
        Has never lang time to stay. diddle
    82.15   Then out the knight has drawn his sword,
        An straiked it oer a strae,
        An thro and thro the fase knights waste
        He gard cauld iron gae:
        An I hope ilk ane sal sae be servd
        That treats ane honest man sae.
