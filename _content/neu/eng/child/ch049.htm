49B.1	THERE was two little boys going to the school,
	And twa little boys they be,
	They met three brothers playing at the ba,
	And ladies dansing hey.
49B.2	&#145;It&#146;s whether will ye play at the ba, brither,
	Or else throw at the stone?&#146;
	&#145;I am too little, I am too young,
	O brother let me alone.&#146;
49B.3	He pulled out a little penknife,
	That was baith sharp and sma,
	He gave his brother a deadly wound
	That was deep, long and sair.
49B.4	He took the holland sark off his back,
	He tore it frae breast to gare,
	He laid it to the bloody wound,
	That still bled mair and mair.
49B.5	&#145;It&#146;s take me on your back, brother,&#146; he says,
	&#145;And carry me to yon kirk-yard,
	And make me there a very fine grave,
	That will be long and large.
49B.6	&#145;Lay my bible at my head,&#146; he says,
	&#145;My chaunter at my feet,
	My bow and arrows by my side,
	And soundly I will sleep.
49B.7	&#145;When you go home, brother,&#146; he says,
	&#145;My father will ask for me;
	You may tell him I am in Saussif town,
	Learning my lesson free.
49B.8	&#145;When you go home, brother,&#146; he says,
	&#145;My mother will ask for me;
	You may tell her I am in Sausaf town,
	And I&#146;ll come home merrily.
49B.9	&#145;When you go home, brother,&#146; he says,
	&#145;Lady Margaret will ask for me;
	You may tell her I&#146;m dead and in grave laid,
	And buried in Sausaff toun.&#146;
49B.10	She put the small pipes to her mouth,
	And she harped both far and near,
	Till she harped the small birds off the briers,
	And her true love out of the grave.
49B.11	&#145;What&#146;s this? what&#146;s this, lady Margaret?&#146; he says,
	&#145;What&#146;s this you want of me?&#146;
	&#145;One sweet kiss of your ruby lips,
	That&#146;s all I want of thee.&#146;
49B.12	&#145;My lips they are so bitter,&#146; he says,
	&#145;My breath it is so strong,
	If you get one kiss of my ruby lips,
	Your days will not be long.&#146;

	&#145;When sun and moon gae three times round,
	And this will never be.&#146;
49F.25	&#145;Ohon, alas! now William, my son,
	This is bad news to me;
	Your brother&#146;s death I&#146;ll aye bewail,
	And the absence o thee.&#146;

49G.1	AS John and William were coming home one day,
	One Saturday afternoon,
	Says John to William, Come and try a fight,
	Or will you throw a stone?
	Or will you come down to yonder, yonder town
	Where the maids are all playing ball, ball, ball,
	Where the maids are all playing ball?
49G.2	Says William to John, I will not try a fight,
	Nor will I throw a stone,
	Nor will I come down to yonder town,
	Where the maids are all playing ball.
49G.3	So John took out of his pocket
	A knife both long and sharp,
	And stuck it through his brother&#146;s heart,
	And the blood came pouring down.
49G.4	Says John to William, Take off thy shirt,
	And tear it from gore to gore,
	And wrap it round your bleeding heart,
	And the blood will pour no more.&#146;
49G.5	So John took off his shirt,
	And tore it from gore to gore,
	And wrapped it round his bleeding heart,
	And the blood came pouring more.
49G.6	&#145;What shall I tell your dear father,
	When I go home to-night?&#146;
	&#145;You&#146;ll tell him I&#146;m dead and in my grave,
	For the truth must be told.&#146;
49G.7	&#145;What shall I tell your dear mother,
	When I go home to-night?&#146;
	&#145;You&#146;ll tell her I&#146;m dead and in my grave,
	For the truth must be told.&#146;
49G.8	&#145;How came this blood upon your knife?
	My son, come tell to me;&#146;
	&#145;It is the blood of a rabbit I have killed,
	O mother, pardon me.&#146;
49G.9	&#145;The blood of a rabbit couldnt be so pure,
	My son, come tell to me:&#146;
	&#145;It is the blood of a squirrel I have killed,
	O mother, pardon me.&#146;
49G.10	&#145;The blood of a squirrel couldnt be so pure,
	My son, come tell to me:&#146;
	&#145;It is the blood of a brother I have killed,
	O mother, pardon me.&#146;

49[H].1	Two pretty boys lived in the North,
	The went to the school so rare;
	The one unto the other said,
	We&#146;ll try some battle of war.
49[H.2]	The worselaid up, the worselaid down,
	Till John lay on the ground;
	A pen-knife out of William&#146;s pocket
	Gave John a deadly wound.
49[H.3]	&#145;O is it for my gold?&#146; he said,
	&#145;Or for my rich monie?
	Or is it for my land sa broad,
	That you have killed me?&#146;
49[H.4]	&#145;It&#146;s neither for your gold,&#146; he said,
	&#145;Or for your rich monie,
	But it is for your land sa broad
	That I have killed thee.&#146;
49[H.5]	&#145;You&#146;ll take [me] up upon your back,
	Carry me to Wastlen kirk-yard;
	You&#146;ill houk a hole large and deep,
	And lay my body there.
49[H.6]	&#145;You&#146;ll put a good stone ou my head,
	Another at me feet,
	A good green turf upon my breast,
	That the sounder I m[a]y sleep.
49[H.7]	&#145;And if my father chance to ask
	What&#146;s come of your brother John,
	. . . . . . .
	. . . . . . . .
	* * * * *
49[H.8]	&#145;What blood is this upon your coat?
	I pray come tell to me;&#146;
	&#145;It is the blood of my grey hound,
	It would not run for me.&#146;
49[H.9]	&#145;The blood of your greyhound was near so red,
	I pray come tell to me;&#146;
	&#145;It is the blood of my black horse,
	It would not hunt for me.&#146;
49[H.10]	&#145;The blood of your black horse was near so red,
	I pray come tell to me;&#146;
	&#145;It is the blood of my brother John,
	Since better canna be.&#146;
	* * * * *
49[H.11]	He put his foot upon a ship,
	Saying, I am gane our the sea;
	&#145;O when will you come back again,
	I pray come tell to me.&#146;
49[H.12]	&#145;When the sun and the moon passes over the broom,
	That[&#146;s] the day you&#146;ll never see.&#146;
