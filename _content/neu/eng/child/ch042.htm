42A.1	CLARK COLVEN and his gay ladie,
	As they walked to yon garden green,
	A belt about her middle gimp,
	Which cost Clark Colven crowns fifteen:
42A.2	&#145;O hearken weel now, my good lord,
	O hearken weel to what I say;
	When ye gang to the wall o Stream,
	O gang nae neer the well-fared may.&#146;
42A.3	&#145;O haud your tongue, my gay ladie,
	Tak nae sic care o me;
	For I nae saw a fair woman
	I like so well as thee.&#146;
42A.4	He mounted on his berry-brown steed,
	And merry, merry rade he on,
	Till he came to the wall o Stream,
	And there he saw the mermaiden.
42A.5	&#145;Ye wash, ye wash, ye bonny may,
	And ay&#146;s ye wash your sark o silk:&#146;
	&#145;It&#146;s a&#146; for you, ye gentle knight,
	My skin is whiter than the milk.&#146;
42A.6	He&#146;s taen her by the milk-white hand,
	He&#146;s taen her by the sleeve sae green,
	And he&#146;s forgotten his gay ladie,
	And away with the fair maiden.
	* * * * *
42A.7	&#145;Ohon, alas!&#146; says Clark Colven,
	&#145;And aye sae sair&#146;s I mean my head!&#146;
	And merrily leugh the mermaiden,
	&#145;O win on till you be dead.
42A.8	&#145;But out ye tak your little pen-knife,
	And frae my sark ye shear a gare;
	Row that about your lovely head,
	And the pain ye&#146;ll never feel nae mair.&#146;
42A.9	Out he has taen his little pen-knife,
	And frae her sark he&#146;s shorn a gare,
	Rowed that about his lovely head,
	But the pain increased mair and mair.
42A.10	&#145;Ohon, alas!&#146; says Clark Colven,
	&#145;An aye sae sair&#146;s I mean my head!&#146;
	And merrily laughd the mermaiden,
	&#145;It will ay be war till ye be dead.&#146;
42A.11	Then out he drew his trusty blade,
	And thought wi it to be her dead,
	But she&#146;s become a fish again,
	And merrily sprang into the fleed.
42A.12	He&#146;s mounted on his berry-brown steed,
	And dowy, dowy rade he home,
	And heavily, heavily lighted down
	When to his ladie&#146;s bower-door he came.
42A.13	&#145;Oh, mither, mither, mak my bed,
	And, gentle ladie, lay me down;
	Oh, brither, brither, unbend my bow,
	&#146;Twill never be bent by me again.&#146;
42A.14	His mither she has made his bed,
	His gentle ladie laid him down,
	His brither he has unbent his bow,
	&#146;Twas never bent by him again.

42B.1	CLERK COLVILL and his lusty dame
	Were walking in the garden green;
	The belt around her stately waist
	Cost Clerk Colvill of pounds fifteen.
42B.2	&#145;O promise me now, Clerk Colvill,
	Or it will cost ye muckle strife,
	Ride never by the wells of Slane,
	If ye wad live and brook your life.&#146;
42B.3	&#145;Now speak nae mair, my lusty dame,
	Now speak nae mair of that to me;
	Did I neer see a fair woman,
	But I wad sin with her body?&#146;
42B.4	He&#146;s taen leave o his gay lady,
	Nought minding what his lady said,
	And he&#146;s rode by the wells of Slane,
	Where washing was a bonny maid.
42B.5	&#145;Wash on, wash on, my bonny maid,
	That wash sae clean your sark of silk;&#146;
	&#145;And weel fa you, fair gentleman,
	Your body whiter than the milk.&#146;
	* * * * *
42B.6	Then loud, loud cry&#146;d the Clerk Colvill,
	&#145;O my head it pains me sair;&#146;
	&#145;Then take, then take,&#146; the maiden said,
	&#145;And frae my sark you&#146;ll cut a gare.&#146;
42B.7	Then she&#146;s gied him a little bane-knife,
	And frae her sark he cut a share;
	She&#146;s ty&#146;d it round his whey-white face,
	But ay his head it aked mair.
42B.8	Then louder cry&#146;d the Clerk Colvill,
	&#145;O sairer, sairer akes my head;&#146;
	&#145;And sairer, sairer ever will,&#146;
	The maiden crys, &#146;Till you be dead.&#146;
42B.9	Out then he drew his shining blade,
	Thinking to stick her where she stood,
	But she was vanishd to a fish,
	And swam far off, a fair mermaid.
42B.10	&#145;O mother, mother, braid my hair;
	My lusty lady, make my bed;
	O brother, take my sword and spear,
	For I have seen the false mermaid.&#146;

	Were in the garden green;
	The band that was about her neck
	Cost Colin pounds fifteen;
	The belt about her middle sae sma
	Cost twice as much again.
42C.2	&#145;Forbidden gin ye wad be, love Colin,
	Forbidden gin ye wad be,
	And gang nae mair to Clyde&#146;s water,
	To court yon gay ladie.&#146;
42C.3	&#145;Forbid me frae your ha, mother,
	Forbid me frae your bour,
	But forbid me not frae yon ladie;
	She&#146;s fair as ony flour.
42C.4	&#145;Forbidden I winna be, mother,
	Forbidden I winna be,
	For I maun gang to Clyde&#146;s water,
	To court yon gay ladie.&#146;
42C.5	An he is on his saddle set,
	As fast as he could win,
	An he is on to Clyde&#146;s water,
	By the lee licht o the moon.
42C.6	An when he cam to the Clyde&#146;s water
	He lichted lowly down,
	An there he saw the mermaiden,
	Washin silk upon a stane.
42C.7	&#145;Come down, come down, now, Clerk Colin,
	Come down an [fish] wi me;
	I&#146;ll row ye in my arms twa,
	An a foot I sanna jee.&#146;

	Nor yet weel fa&#146;en asleep,
	When up an started the mermaiden,
	Just at Clerk Colin&#146;s feet.
42C.10	&#145;Will ye lie there an die, Clerk Colin,
	Will ye lie there an die?
	Or will ye gang to Clyde&#146;s water,
	To fish in flood wi me?&#146;
42C.11	&#145;I will lie here an die,&#146; he said,
	&#145;I will lie here an die;
	In spite o a&#146; the deils in hell
	I will lie here an die.&#146;
