<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">207A: Lord Delamere</H1>
<PRE>

207A.1	 GOOD people, give attention, a story you shall hear,
	 It is of the king and my lord Delamere;
	 The quarrel it arose in the Parliament House,
	 Concdrning some taxations going to be put in force.
	 Ri toora loora la.
207A.2	 Says my lord Delamere to his Majesty soon,
	 &#145;If it please you, my liege, of you I&#146;ll soon beg a boon.&#146;
	 &#145;Then what is your boon? let me it understand:&#146;
	 &#145;It&#146;s to have all the poor men you have in your land.
207A.3	 &#145;And I&#146;ll take them to Cheshire, and there I will sow
	 Both hempseed and flaxseed, and [hang] them all in a row.
	 Why, they&#146;d better be hanged, and stopped soon their breath,
	 If it please you, my liege, than to starve them to death.&#146;
207A.4	 Then up starts a French lord, as we do hear,
	 Saying, &#145;Thou art a proud Jack,&#146; to my lord Delamere;
	 &#145;Thou oughtest to be stabbed&#146;-+--+-then he turnd him about-+--+-
	 &#145;For affronting the king in the Parliament House.&#146;
207A.5	 Then up starts his grace, the Duke of Devonshire,
	 Saying, I&#146;ll fight in defence of my lord Delamere.
	 Then a stage was erected, to battle they went,
	 To kill or to be killed was our noble duke&#146;s intent.
207A.6	 The very first push, as we do understand,
	 The duke&#146;s sword he bended it back into his hand.
	 He waited a while, but nothing he spoke,
	 Till on the king&#146;s armour his rapier he broke.
207A.7	 An English lord, who by that stage did stand,
	 Threw Devonshire another, and he got it in his hand:
	 &#145;Play low for your life, brave Devonshire,&#146; said he,
	 &#145;Play low for your life, or a dead man you will be.&#146;
207A.8	 Devonshire dropped on his knee, and gave him his death-wound;
	 O then that French lord fell dead upon the ground.
	 The king called his guards, and he unto them did say,
	 &#145;Bring Devonshire down, and take the dead man away.&#146;
207A.9	 &#145;No, if it please you, my liege, no! I&#146;ve slain him like a man;
	 I&#146;m resolved to see what clothing he&#146;s got on.
	 Oh, fie upon your treachery, your treachery!&#146; said he,
	 &#145;Oh, king, &#146;twas your intention to have took my life away.
207A.10	 &#145;For he fought in your armour, whilst I have fought in bare;
	 The same thou shalt win, king, before thou does it wear.&#146;
	 Then they all turned back to the Parliament House,
	 And the nobles made obesiance with their hands to their mouths.
207A.11	 &#145;God bless all the nobles we have in our land,
	 And send the Church of England may flourish still and stand;
	 For I&#146;ve injured no king, no kingdom, nor no crown,
	 But I wish that every honest man might enjoy his own.&#146;

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">207B: Lord Delamere</H3>
<PRE>

207B.1	 GOOD people give attention to a story you shall hear:
	 Between the king and my lord Delamere,
	 A quarrel arose in the Parliament House,
	 Concerning the taxes to be put in force.
	 With my fal de ral de ra.
207B.2	 I wonder, I wonder that James, our good king,
	 So many hard taxes upon the poor should bring;
	 So many hard taxes, as I have heard them say,
	 Makes many a good farmer to break and run away.
207B.3	 Such a rout has been in the parliament, as I hear,
	 Betwixt a Dutch lord and my lord Delamere.
	 He said to the king, as he sat on the throne,
	 &#145;If it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon.&#146;
207B.4	 &#145;O what is thy boon? Come. let me understand.&#146;
	 &#145;&#146;Tis to give me all the poor you have in the land;
	 I&#146;ll take them down to Cheshire, and there I will sow
	 Both hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them in a row.
207B.5	 &#145;It&#146;s better, my liege, they should die a shorter death
	 Than for your Majesty to starve them on earth.&#146;
	 With that up starts a Dutch lord, as we hear,
	 And he says, &#145;Thou proud Jack,&#146; to my lord Delamere,
207B.6	 &#145;Thou ought to be stabbed,&#146; and he turned him about,
	 &#145;For affronting the king in the Parliament House.&#146;
	 Then up got a brave duke, the Duke of Devonshire,
	 Who said, I will fight for my lord Delamere.
207B.7	 &#145;He is under age, as I&#146;ll make it appear,
	 So I&#146;ll stand in defence of my lord Delamere.&#146;
	 A stage then was built, and to battle they went,
	 To kill or be killed it was their intent.
207B.8	 The very first blow, as we understand,
	 Devonshire&#146;s rapier went back to his hand;
	 Then he mused awhile, but not a word spoke,
	 When against the king&#146;s armour his rapier he broke.
207B.9	 O then he stept backward, and backward stept he,
	 And then stept forward my lord Willoughby;
	 He gave him a rapier, and thus he did say;
	 Play low, Devonshire, there&#146;s treachery, I see.
207B.10	 He knelt on his knee, and he gave him the wound,
	 With that the Dutch lord fell dead on the ground:
	 The king calld his soldiers, and thus he did say:
	 Call Devonshire down, take the dead man away.
207B.11	 He answered, My liege, I&#146;ve killed him like a man,
	 And it is my intent to see what clothing he&#146;s got on.
	 O treachery! O treachery! as I well may say,
	 It was your intent, O king, to take my life away.
207B.12	 &#145;He fought in your armour, while I fought him bare,
	 And thou, king, shalt win it before thou dost it wear;
	 I neither do curse king, parliament, or throne,
	 But I wish every honest man may enjoy his own.
207B.13	 &#145;The rich men do flourish with silver and gold,
	 While poor men are starving with hunger and cold;
	 And if they hold on as they have begun,
	 They&#146;ll make little England pay dear for a king.&#146;

207C.1	 O THE Duchess of Devonshire was standing hard by;
	 Upon her dear husband she cast her lovely eye:
	 &#145;Oh, fie upon treachery! there&#146;s been treachery I say,
	 It was your full intent to have taen my duke&#146;s life away.&#146;
207C.2	 Then away to the parliament these votes all went again,
	 And there they acted like just and honest men.
	 I neither curse my king, nor kingdom, crown or throne,
	 But I wish every honest man to enjoy but what is his own.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">207D: Lord Delamere</H3>
<PRE>

207D.1	 IN the Parliament House a great rout has been there,
	 Betwixt our good king and the lord Delaware:
	 Says Lord Delaware to his Majesty full soon,
	 &#145;Will it please you, my liege, to grant me a boon?&#146;
207D.2	 &#145;What&#146;s your boon?&#146; says the king, &#146;Now let me understand.&#146;
	 &#145;It&#146;s, give me all the poor men we&#146;ve starving in this land,
	 And without delay I&#146;ll hie me to Lincolnshire,
	 To sow hemp-seed and flax-seed, and hang them all there.
207D.3	 &#145;For with hempen cord it&#146;s better to stop each poor man&#146;s breath
	 Than with famine you should see your subjects starve to death.&#146;
	 Up starts a Dutch lord, who to Delaware did say,
	 Thou deservest to be stabbd! then he turnd himself away.
207D.4	 &#145;Thou deservest to be stabbd, and the dogs have thine ears,
	 For insulting our king, in this parliament of peers.&#146;
	 Up sprang a Welsh lord, the brave Duke of Devonshire:
	 &#145;In young Delaware&#146;s defence, I&#146;ll fight this Dutch lord, my sire.
207D.5	 &#145;For he is in the right, and I&#146;ll make it so appear;
	 Him I dare to single combat, for insulting Delaware.&#146;
	 A stage was soon erected, and to combat they went;
	 For to kill or to be killd, it was either&#146;s full intent.
207D.6	 But the very first flourish, when the heralds gave command,
	 The sword of brave Devonshire bent backward on his hand.
	 In suspense he paused a while, scannd his foe before he strake,
	 Then against the king&#146;s armour his bent sword he brake.
207D.7	 Then he sprang from the stage to a soldier in the ring,
	 Saying, Lend your sword, that to an end this tragedy we bring.
	 Though he&#146;s fighting me in armour, while I am fighting bare,
	 Even more than this I&#146;d venture for young Lord Delaware.
207D.8	 Leaping back on the stage, sword to buckler now resounds,
	 Till he left the Dutch lord a bleeding in his wounds.
	 This seeing, cries the king to his guards without delay,
	 Call Devonshire down! take the dead man away!
207D.9	 &#145;No,&#146; says brave Devonshire, &#145;I&#146;ve fought him as a man;
	 Since he&#146;s dead, I will keep the trophies I have won.
	 For he fought me in your armour, while I fought him bare,
	 And the same you must win back, my liege, if ever you them wear.
207D.10	 &#145;God bless the Church of England! may it prosper on each hand,
	 And also every poor man now starving in this land.
	 And while I pray success may crown our king upon his throne,
	 I&#146;ll wish every poor man may long enjoy his own.&#146;
