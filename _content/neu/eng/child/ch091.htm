<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">91A: Fair Mary of Wallington</H1>
<PRE>

91A.1	WHEN we were silly sisters seven,
	sisters were so fair,
	Five of us were brave knights&#146; wives,
	and died in childbed lair.
91A.2	Up then spake Fair Mary,
	marry woud she nane;
	If ever she came in man&#146;s bed,
	the same gate wad she gang.
91A.3	&#145;Make no vows, Fair Mary,
	for fear they broken be;
	Here&#146;s been the Knight of Wallington,
	asking good will of thee.&#146;
91A.4	&#145;If here&#146;s been the knight, mother,
	asking good will of me,
	Within three quarters of a year
	you may come bury me.&#146;
91A.5	When she came to Wallington,
	and into Wallington hall,
	There she spy&#146;d her mother dear,
	walking about the wall.
91A.6	&#145;You&#146;re welcome, daughter dear,
	to thy castle and thy bowers;&#146;
	&#145;I thank you kindly, mother,
	I hope they&#146;ll soon be yours.&#146;
91A.7	She had not been in Wallington
	three quarters and a day,
	Till upon the ground she could not walk,
	she was a weary prey.
91A.8	She had not been in Wallington
	three quarters and a night,
	Till on the ground she coud not walk,
	she was a weary wight.
91A.9	&#145;Is there neer a boy in this town,
	who&#146;ll win hose and shun,
	That will run to fair Pudlington,
	and bid my mother come?&#146;
91A.10	Up then spake a little boy,
	near unto a-kin;
	&#145;Full oft I have your errands gone,
	but now I will it run.&#146;
91A.11	Then she calld her waiting-maid
	to bring up bread and wine:
	&#145;Eat and drink, my bonny boy,
	thou&#146;ll neer eat more of mine.
91A.12	&#145;Give my respects to my mother,
	[as] she sits in her chair of stone,
	And ask her how she likes the news,
	of seven to have but one.
91A.13	[&#145;Give my respects to my mother,
	as she sits in her chair of oak,
	And bid her come to my sickening,
	or my merry lake-wake.]
91A.14	&#145;Give my love to my brother
	William, Ralph, and John,
	And to my sister Betty fair,
	and to her white as bone.
91A.15	&#145;And bid her keep her maidenhead,
	be sure make much on&#146;t,
	For if eer she come in man&#146;s bed,
	the same gate will she gang.&#146;
91A.16	Away this little boy is gone,
	as fast as he could run;
	When he came where brigs were broke,
	he lay down and swum.
91A.17	When he saw the lady, he said,
	Lord may your keeper be!
	&#145;What news, my pretty boy,
	hast thou to tell to me?&#146;
91A.18	&#145;Your daughter Mary orders me,
	as you sit in a chair of stone,
	To ask you how you like the news,
	of seven to have but one.
91A.19	&#145;Your daughter gives commands,
	as you sit in a chair of oak,
	And bids you come to her sickening,
	or her merry lake-wake.
91A.20	&#145;She gives command to her brother
	William, Ralph, and John,
	[And] to her sister Betty fair,
	and to her white as bone.
91A.21	&#145;She bids her keep her maidenhead,
	be sure make much on&#146;t,
	for if eer she came in man&#146;s bed,
	the same gate woud she gang.&#146;
91A.22	She kickt the table with her foot,
	she kickt it with her knee,
	The silver plate into the fire,
	so far she made it flee.
91A.23	Then she calld her waiting-maid
	to bring her riding-hood,
	So did she on her stable-groom
	to bring her riding-steed.
91A.24	&#145;Go saddle to me the black [the black,]
	go saddle to me the brown,
	Go saddle to me the swiftest steed
	that eer rid [to] Wallington.&#146;
91A.25	When they came to Wallington,
	and into Wallington hall,
	There she spy&#146;d her son Fenwick,
	walking about the wall.
91A.26	&#145;God save you, dear son,
	Lord may your keeper be!
	Where is my daughter fair,
	that used to walk with thee?&#146;
91A.27	He turnd his head round about,
	the tears did fill his ee:
	&#145;&#146;Tis a month,&#146; he said, &#145;Since she
	took her chambers from me.&#146;
91A.28	She went on . . .
	and there were in the hall
	Four and twenty ladies,
	letting the tears down fall.
91A.29	Her daughter had a scope
	into her cheek and into her chin,
	All to keep her life
	till her dear mother came.
91A.30	&#145;Come take the rings off my fingers,
	the skin it is so white,
	And give them to my mother dear,
	for she was all the wite.
91A.31	&#145;Come take the rings off my fingers,
	the veins they are so red,
	Give them to Sir William Fenwick,
	I&#146;m sure his heart will bleed.&#146;
91A.32	She took out a razor
	that was both sharp and fine,
	And out of her left side has taken
	the heir of Wallington.
91A.33	There is a race in Wallington,
	and that I rue full sare;
	Tho the cradle it be full spread up,
	the bride-bed is left bare.

	And five are dead wi child;
	There is nane but you and I, Maisry,
	And we&#146;ll go maidens mild.&#146;
91C.2	She hardly had the word spoken,
	And turnd her round about,
	When the bonny Earl of Livingston
	Was calling Maisry out.
91C.3	Upon a bonny milk-white steed,
	That drank out o the Tyne,
	And a&#146; was for her Lady Maisry,
	To take her hyne and hyne.
91C.4	Upon a bonny milk-white steed,
	That drank out o the Tay,
	And a&#146; was for her Lady Maisry,
	To carry her away.
91C.5	She had not been at Livingston
	A twelve month and a day,
	Until she was as big wi bairn
	As any ladie coud gae.
91C.6	She calld upon her little foot-page,
	Says, Ye maun run wi speed,
	And bid my mother come to me,
	For of her I&#146;ll soon have need.
91C.7	&#145;See, there is the brootch frae my hause-bane,
	It is of gowd sae ried;
	Gin she winna come when I&#146;m alive,
	Bid her come when I am dead.&#146;
91C.8	But ere she wan to Livingston,
	As fast as she coud ride,
	The gaggs they were in Maisry&#146;s mouth,
	And the sharp sheers in her side.
91C.9	Her good lord wrang his milk-white hands,
	Till the gowd rings flaw in three:

	For I bare the bird between my sides,
	Yet I maun thole her to die.&#146;
91C.11	Then out it spake her sister dear,
	As she sat at her head:
	&#145;That man is not in Christendoom
	Shall gar me die sicken dead.&#146;
91C.12	&#145;O hold your tongue, my ae daughter,
	Let a&#146; your folly be,

91F.1	&#145;O WE were seven brave sisters,
	Five of us died wi child,
	And nane but you and I, Maisry,
	so we&#146;ll gae maidens mild.&#146;
91F.2	&#145;O had your tongue, now Lady Margaret,
	Let a&#146; your folly be;
	I&#146;ll gar you keep your true promise
	To the lad ayont the sea.&#146;
91F.3	&#145;O there is neither lord nor knight
	My love shall ever won,
	Except it be Lord Darlington,
	And here he winna come.&#146;
91F.4	But when the hour o twall was past,
	And near the hour o one,
	Lord Darlington came to the yetts,
	Wi thirty knights and ten.
91F.5	Then he has wedded Lady Margaret,
	And brought her oer the sea,
	And there was nane that lived on earth
	Sae happy as was she.
91F.6	But when nine months were come and gane
	Strong travailling took she,
	And nae physician in the land
	Could ease her maladie.
91F.7	&#145;Where will I get a little wee boy,
	Will won baith meat and fee,
	That will gae on to Seaton&#146;s yetts,
	Bring my mother to me?&#146;
91F.8	&#145;O here am I, a little wee boy,
	That will won meat and fee,
	That will gae on to Seaton&#146;s yetts,
	And bring your mother to thee.&#146;
91F.9	Then he is on to Seaton&#146;s yetts,
	As fast as gang could he;
	Says, Ye must come to Darlington,
	Your daughter for to see.
91F.10	But when she came to Darlington,
	Where there was little pride,
	The scobbs were in the lady&#146;s mouth,
	The sharp sheer in her side.
91F.11	Darlington stood on the stair,
	And gart the gowd rings flee:
	&#145;My ha&#146;s and bowers and a&#146; shall gae waste,
	If my bonny love die for me.&#146;
91F.12	&#145;O had your tongue, Lord Darlington,
	Let a&#146; your folly be;
	I boor the bird within my sides,
	I&#146;ll suffer her to die.
91F.13	&#145;But he that marries my daughter,
	I think he is a fool;
	If he marries her at Candlemas,
	She&#146;ll be frae him ere Yule.
91F.14	&#145;I had seven ance in companie,
	This night I go my lane;
	And when I come to Clyde&#146;s water,
	I wish that I may drown.&#146;
