# 111: Crow and Pie


    111.1    THROUGHE a forest as I can ryde,
         To take my sporte yn an mornyng,
         I cast my eye on euery syde,
         I was ware of a bryde syngynge.
    111.2    I sawe a faire mayde come rydyng;
         I speake to hur of loue, I trowe;
         She answered me all yn scornyng,
         And sayd, The crowe shall byte yow.
    111.3    I pray yow, damesell, scorne me nott;
         To wyn your loue ytt ys my wyll;
         For your loue I haue dere bought,
         And I wyll take good hede thertyll.
    111.4    Nay, for God, ser, that I nyll;
         I tell the, Jenken, as I trowe,
         Thou shalt nott fynde me suche a gyll;
         Therfore the crowe shall byte yow.
    111.5    He toke then owt a good golde ryng,
         A purse of velweytt, that was soo fyne:
         Haue ye thys, my dere swetyng,
         With that ye wylbe lemman myn.
    111.6    Be Cryst, I dare nott, for my dame,
         To dele with hym that I doo nott knowe;
         For soo I myght dyspyse my name;
         Therfore the crow shall byte yow.
    111.7    He toke hur abowte the mydell small,
         That was soo faire of hyde and hewe;
         He kyssed hur cheke as whyte as whall,
         And prayed hur that she wolde vpon hym rewe.
    111.8    She scornyd hym, and callyd hym Hew;
         His loue was as a paynted blowe:
         To-day me, to-morrowe a newe;
         Therfore the crow shall byte yow.
    111.9    He toke hur abowte the mydell small,
         And layd hur downe vpon the grene;
         Twys or thrys he served hur soo withall,
         He wolde nott stynt yet, as I wene.
    111.10   But sythe ye haue i-lyen me bye,
         Ye wyll wedde me now, as I trowe:
         I wyll be aduysed, Gyll, sayd he,
         For now the pye hathe peckyd yow.
    111.11   But sythe ye haue i-leyn me by,
         And brought my body vnto shame,
         Some of your good ye wyll part with me,
         Or elles, be Cryst, ye be to blame.
    111.12   I wylbe aduysed, he sayde;
         THe wynde ys wast that thow doyst blowe;
         I haue a-noder that most be payde;
         Therfore the pye hathe pecked yow.
    111.13   Now sythe ye haue i-leyn me bye,
         A lyttle thyng ye wyll tell;
         In case that I with chylde be,
         What ys your name? Wher doo ye dwell?
    111.14   At Yorke, at London, at Clerkenwell,
         At Leycester, Cambryge, at myrye Brystowe;
         Some call me Rychard, Robart, Jacke, and Wyll;
         For now the pye hathe peckyd yow.
    111.15   But, all medons, be ware be rewe,
         And lett no man downe yow throwe;
         For and yow doo, ye wyll ytt rewe,
         For then the pye wyll pecke yow.
    111.16   Farewell, corteor, ouer the medoo,
         Pluke vp your helys, I yow beshrew!
         Your trace, wher so euer ye ryde or goo,
         Crystes curse goo wythe yow!
    111.17   Thoughe a knave hathe by me layne,
         Yet am I noder dede nor slowe;
         I trust to recouer my harte agayne,
         And Crystes curse goo wythe yow!
