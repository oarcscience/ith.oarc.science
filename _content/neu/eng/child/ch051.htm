51A.1	LIZIE WAN sits at her father&#146;s bower-door,
	Weeping and making a mane,
	And by there came her father dear:
	&#145;What ails thee, Lizie Wan?&#146;
51A.2	&#145;I ail, and I ail, dear father,&#146; she said,
	&#145;And I&#146;ll tell you a reason for why;
	There is a child between my twa sides,
	Between my dear billy and I.&#146;
51A.3	Now Lizie Wan sits at her father&#146;s bower-door,
	Sighing and making a mane,
	And by there came her brother dear:
	&#145;What ails thee, Lizie Wan?&#146;
51A.4	&#145;I ail, I ail, dear brither,&#146; she said,
	&#145;And I&#146;ll tell you a reason for why;
	There is a child bewteen my twa sides,
	Between you, dear billy, and I.&#146;
51A.5	&#145;And hast thou tald father and mother o that?
	And hast thou tald sae o me?&#146;
	And he has drawn his gude braid sword,
	That hung down by his knee.

51A.6	And he has cutted aff Lizie Wan&#146;s head,
	And her fair body in three,
	And he&#146;s awa to his mothers bower,
	And sair aghast was he.
51A.7	&#145;What ails thee, what ails thee, Geordy Wan?
	What ails thee sae fast to rin?
	For I see by thy ill colour
	Some fallow&#146;s deed thou hast done.&#146;
51A.8	&#145;Some fallow&#146;s deed I have done, mother,
	And I pray you pardon me;
	For I&#146;ve cutted aff my greyhound&#146;s head;
	He wadna rin for me.&#146;
51A.9	&#145;Thy greyhound&#146;s bluid was never sae red,
	O my son Geordy Wan!
	For I see by thy ill colour
	Some fallow&#146;s deed thou hast done.&#146;
51A.10	&#145;Some fallow&#146;s deed I hae done, mother,
	And I pray you pardon me;
	For I hae cutted aff Lizie Wan&#146;s head
	And her fair body in three.&#146;
51A.11	&#145;O what wilt thou do when thy father comes hame,
	O my son Geordy Wan?&#146;
	&#145;I&#146;ll set my foot in a bottomless boat,
	And swim to the sea-ground.&#146;
51A.12	&#145;And when will thou come hame again,
	O my son Geordy Wan?&#146;
	&#145;The sun and the moon shall dance on the green
	That night when I come hame.&#146;
