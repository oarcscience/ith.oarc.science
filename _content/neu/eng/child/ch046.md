# 46A: Captain Wedderburn’s Courtship


    46A.1   THE laird of Bristolls daughter was in the woods walking,
        And by came Captain Wetherbourn, a servant to the king;
        And he said to his livery man, Wert not against the law,
        I would tak her to mine ain bed, and lay her neist the wa.
    46A.2   Im into my fathers woods, amongst my fathers trees,
        O kind sir, let mee walk alane, O kind sir, if you please;
        The butlers bell it will be rung, and Ill be mist awa;
        Ill lye into mine ain bed, neither at stock nor wa.
    46A.3   O my bonny lady, the bed its not be mine,
        For Ill command my servants for to call it thine;
        The hangings are silk satin, the sheets are holland sma,
        And wes baith lye in ae bed, but yous lye neist the wa.
    46A.4   And so, my bonny lady, -+-I do not know your name,-+-
        But my names Captain Wetherburn, and Im a man of fame;
        Tho your father and a his men were here, I would na stand in awe
        To tak you to mine ain bed, and lay you neist the wa.
    46A.5   Oh my bonny, bonny lady, if youll gie me your hand,
        You shall hae drums and trumpets to sound at your command;
        Wi fifty men to guard you, sae weel their swords can dra,
        And wees baith lye in ae bed, but yous lye neist the wa.
    46A.6   Hes mounted her upon a steid, behind his gentleman,
        And he himself did walk afoot, to had his lady on,
        With his hand about her midle sae jimp, for fear that she should fa;
        She man lye in his bed, but shell not lye neist the wa.
    46A.7   Hes taen her into Edinburgh, his landlady cam ben:
        And monny bonny ladys in Edinburgh hae I seen,
        But the like of this fine creature my eyes they never sa;
        O dame bring ben a down-bed, for shes lye neist the wa.
    46A.8   Hold your tongue, young man, she said, a+end dinna trouble me,
        Unless you get to my supper, and that is dishes three;
        Dishes three to my supper, tho I eat nane at a,
        Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
    46A.9   You maun get to my supper a cherry but a stane,
        And you man get to my supper a capon but a bane,
        And you man get a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga,
        Before I lye in your bed, but Ill not lye neist the wa.
    46A.10  A cherry whan in blossom is a cherry but a stane;
        A capon when hes in the egg canna hae a bane;
        The dow it is a gentle bird that flies wanting the ga;
        And ye man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.
    46A.11  Hold your tongue, young man, she said, a+end dinna me perplex,
        Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions six;
        Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa,
        Before I lye in your bed, but Ill not lye neist the wa.
    46A.12  What is greener than the grass, whats higher than the tree?
        Whats war than a womans wiss, whats deeper than the sea?
        What bird sings first, and whereupon the dew down first does fa?
        Before I lye in your bed, but Ill lye neist the wa.
    46A.13  Virgus is greener than the grass, heavens higher than the tree;
        The deils war than a womans wish, hells deeper than the sea;
        The cock sings first, on the Sugar Loaf the dew down first does fa;
        And ye man lye in my bed, betweest me and the wa.
    46A.14  Hold your tongue, young man, she said, I pray you give it oer,
        Unless you tell me questions, and that is questions four;
        Tell me them as I shall ask them, and that is twa by twa,
        Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
    46A.15  You man get to me a plumb that does in winter grow;
        And likewise a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro;
        A sparrows horn, a priest unborn, this night to join us twa,
        Before I lye in your bed, but I winna lye neist the wa.
    46A.16  There is a plumb in my fathers yeard that does in winter grow;
        Likewise he has a silk mantle that never waft gaed thro;
        A sparrows horn, it may be found, theres ane in every tae,
        Theres ane upo the mouth of him, perhaps there may be twa.
    46A.17  The priest is standing at the door, just ready to come in;
        Nae man could sae that he was born, to lie it is a sin;
        For a wild boar bored him mothers side, he out of it did fa;
        And you man lye in my bed, between me and the wa.
    46A.18  Little kent Grizey Sinclair, that morning when she raise,
        Twas to be the hindermost of a her single days;
        For now shes Captain Wetherburns wife, a man she never saw,
        And she man lye in his bed, but shell not lye neist the wa.

### 46B: Captain Wedderburn’s Courtship


    46B.1   THE Lord of Rosslyns daughter gaed through the wud her lane,
        And there she met Captain Wedderburn, a servant to the king.
        He said unto his livery-man, Weret na agen the law,
        I wad tak her to my ain bed, and lay her at the wa.
    46B.2   Im walking here my lane, she says, amang my fathers trees;
        And ye may lat me walk my lane, kind sir, now gin ye please.
        The supper-bell it will be rung, and Ill be missd awa;
        Sae Ill na lie in your bed, at neither stock nor wa.
    46B.3   He said, My pretty lady, I pray lend me your hand,
        And yell hae drums and trumpets always at your command;
        And fifty men to guard ye wi, that weel their swords can draw;
        Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yell lie at the wa.
    46B.4   Haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray let go my hand;
        The supper-bell it will be rung, nae langer maun I stand.
        My father hell na supper tak, gif I be missd awa;
        Sae Ill na lie in your bed, at neither stock nor wa.
    46B.5   O my name is Captain Wedderburn, my name Ill neer deny,
        And I command ten thousand men, upo yon mountains high.
        Tho your father and his men were here, of them Id stand na awe,
        But should tak ye to my ain bed, and lay ye neist the wa.
    46B.6   Then he lap aff his milk-white steed, and set the lady on,
        And a the way he walkd on foot, he held her by the hand;
        He held her by the middle jimp, for fear that she should fa;
        Saying, Ill tak ye to my ain bed, and lay thee at the wa.
    46B.7   He took her to his quartering-house, his landlady looked ben,
        Saying, Monie a pretty ladie in Edinbruch Ive seen;
        But sic na pretty ladie is not into it a:
        Gae, mak for her a fine down-bed, and lay her at the wa.
    46B.8   O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray ye lat me be,
        For Ill na lie in your bed till I get dishes three;
        Dishes three maun be dressd for me, gif I should eat them a,
        Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
    46B.9   Tis I maun hae to my supper a chicken without a bane;
        And I maun hae to my supper a cherry without a stane;
        And I maun hae to my supper a bird without a gaw,
        Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
    46B.10  Whan the chickens in the shell, I am sure it has na bane;
        And whan the cherrys in the bloom, I wat it has na stane;
        The dove she is a genty bird, she flees without a gaw;
        Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yell be at the wa.
    46B.11  O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray ye give me owre,
        For Ill na lie in your bed, till I get presents four;
        Presents four ye maun gie me, and that is twa and twa,
        Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
    46B.12  Tis I maun hae some winter fruit that in December grew;
        And I maun hae a silk mantil that waft gaed never through;
        A sparrows horn, a priest unborn, this nicht to join us twa,
        Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
    46B.13  My father has some winter fruit that in December grew;
        My mither has a silk mantil the waft gaed never through;
        A sparrows horn ye soon may find, theres ane on evry claw,
        And twa upo the gab o it, and ye shall get them a.
    46B.14  The priest he stands without the yett, just ready to come in;
        Nae man can say he eer was born, nae man without he sin;
        He was haill cut frae his mithers side, and frae the same let fa;
        Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yese lie at the wa.
    46B.15  O haud awa frae me, kind sir, I pray dont me perplex,
        For Ill na lie in your bed till ye answer questions six:
        Questions six ye maun answer me, and that is four and twa,
        Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
    46B.16  O what is greener than the gress, whats higher than thae trees?
        O what is worse than womens wish, whats deeper than the seas?
        What bird craws first, what tree buds first, what first does on them fa?
        Before I lie in your bed, at either stock or wa.
    46B.17  Death is greener than the gress, heaven higher than thae trees;
        The devils waur than womens wish, hells deeper than the seas;
        The cock craws first, the cedar buds first, dew first on them does fa;
        Sae well baith lie in ae bed, and yese lie at the wa.
    46B.18  Little did this lady think, that morning whan she raise,
        That this was for to be the last o a her maiden days.
        But theres na into the kings realm to be found a blither twa,
        And now shes Mrs. Wedderburn, and she lies at the wa.

    46C.1   THE laird of Roslins daughter walked thro the wood her lane,
        And by came Captain Wedderburn, a servant to the Queen;
        He said unto his serving man, Wert not agaynst the law,
        I would tak her to my ain house as lady o my ha.
    46C.2   He said, My pretty ladye, I pray give me your hand;
        You shall have drums and trumpets always at your command;

        And Ill tak ye to my ain bed, and lay you next the wa.
    46C.3   Im walking in my feythers shaws: quo he, My charming maid,
        I am much better than I look, so be you not afraid;
        For I serve the queen of a Scotland, and a gentil dame is she;
        So wese be married ere the morn, gin ye can fancy me.
    46C.4   . . . . . .
        . . . . .
        The sparrow shall toot on his horn, gif naething us befa,
        And Ill mak you up a down-bed, and lay you next the wa.
    46C.5   Now hold away from me, kind sir, I pray you let me be;
        I wont be lady of your ha till you answer questions three;
        Questions three you must answer me, and that is one and twa,
        Before I gae to Woodlands house, and be lady o your ha.
    46C.6   You must get me to my supper a chicken without a bone;
        You must get me to my supper a cherry without a stone;
        You must get me to my supper a bird without a ga,
        Before I go to Woodlands house and be lady of your ha.
    46C.7   When the cherry is in the bloom, Im sure it has no stone;
        When the chickens in the shell, Im sure it has nae bone;
        The dove she is a gentil bird, and flies without a ga;
        So Ive answered you your questions three, and youre lady of my ha.
        * * * * *
    46C.8   Questions three you must answer me: Whats higher than the trees?
        And what is worse than womans voice? Whats deeper than the seas?
        . . . . . .
        . . . . .
    46C.9   He answered then so readily: Heavens higher than the trees;
        The devils worse than womans voice; hells deeper than the seas;
        . . . . . .
        . . . . .
    46C.10  One question still you must answer me, or you I laugh to scorn;
        Go seek me out an English priest, of woman never born;
        . . . . . .
        . . . . .
    46C.11  Oh then, quo he, My young brother from mothers side was torn,
        And hes a gentil English priest, of woman never born;
        . . . . . .
        . . . . .
    46C.12  Little did his lady think, that morning when she raise,
        It was to be the very last of all her mayden days;
        . . . .
        . . . . .
