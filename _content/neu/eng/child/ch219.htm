219A.1	 THE gardener stands in his bower-door,
	 With a primrose in his hand,
	 And by there came a leal maiden,
	 As jimp&#146;s a willow wand.
	 And by, etc.
219A.2	 &#145;O lady, can you fancy me,
	 For to be my bride,
	 You&#146;ll get a&#146; the flowers in my garden,
	 To be to you a weed.
219A.3	 &#145;The lily white shall be your smock;
	 Becomes your body neat;
	 And your head shall be deckd with jelly-flower,
	 And the primrose in your breast.
219A.4	 &#145;Your gown shall be o the sweet-william,
	 Your coat o camovine,
	 And your apron o the salads neat,
	 That taste baith sweet and fine.
219A.5	 &#145;Your stockings shall be o the broad kail-blade,
	 That is baith broad and long;
	 And narrow, narrow at the coot,
	 And broad, broad at the brawn.
219A.6	 &#145;Your gloves shall be the marygold,
	 All glittering to your hand,
	 Well spread oer wi the blue blaewort,
	 That grows in corn-land.&#146;
219A.7	 &#145;O fare you well, young man,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;Farewell, and I bid adieu;
	 Since you&#146;ve provided a weed for me,
	 Among the summer flowers,
	 Then I&#146;ll provide another for you,
	 Among the winter showers.
219A.8	 &#145;The new-fallen snow to be your smock;
	 Becomes your body neat;
	 And your head shall be deckd with the eastern wind,
	 And the cold rain on your breast.&#146;

219B.1	 ALL ye young men, I pray draw near,
	 I&#146;ll let you hear my mind
	 Concerning those who fickle are,
	 And inconstant as the wind.
219B.2	 A pretty maid who late livd here,
	 And sweetheatrs many had,
	 The gardener-lad he viewd them all,
	 Just as they came and gaed.
219B.3	 The gardener-lad he viewd them all,
	 But swore he had no skill:
	 &#145;If I were to go as oft to her,
	 Ye surely would me kill.
219B.4	 &#145;I&#146;m sure she&#146;s not a proper maid,
	 I&#146;m sure she is not tall;&#146;
	 Another young man standing by,
	 he said, Slight none at all.
219B.5	 &#145;For we&#146;re all come of woman,&#146; he said,
	 &#145;If ye woud call to mind,
	 And to all women for her sake
	 Ye surely should be kind.&#146;
219B.6	 &#145;The summer hours and warm showers
	 Make the the trees yield in the ground,
	 And kindly words will woman win,
	 And this maid I&#146;ll surround.&#146;
219B.7	 The maid then stood in her bower-door,
	 As straight as ony wand,
	 When by it came the gardener-lad,
	 With his hat in his hand.
219B.8	 &#145;Will ye live on fruit,&#146; he said?
	 &#145;Or will ye marry me?
	 And amongst the flowers in my garden
	 I&#146;ll shape a weed for thee.&#146;
219B.9	 &#145;I will live on fruit,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;But I&#146;ll never marry thee;
	 For I can live without mankind,
	 And without mankind I&#146;ll die.&#146;
219B.10	 &#145;Ye shall not live without mankind,
	 If ye&#146;ll accept of me;
	 For among the flowers in my garden
	 I&#146;ll shape a weed for thee.
219B.11	 &#145;The lily white to be your smock;
	 Becomes your body best;
	 And the jelly-flower to be your quill,
	 And the red rose in your breast.
219B.12	 &#145;Your gown shall be o the pingo white,
	 Your petticoat cammovine,
	 Your apron o the seel o downs;
	 Come smile, sweet heart o mine!
219B.13	 &#145;Your shoes shall be o the gude rue red-+--+-
	 Never did I garden ill-+--+-
	 Your stockings o the mary mild;
	 Come smile, sweet heart, your fill!
219B.14	 &#145;Your gloves shall be o the green clover,
	 Comes lockerin to your hand,
	 Well dropped oer wi blue blavers,
	 That grow among white land.&#146;
219B.15	 &#145;Young man, ye&#146;ve shap&#146;d a weed for me,
	 In summer among your flowers;
	 Now I will shape another for you,
	 Among the winter showers.
219B.16	 &#145;The snow so white shall be your shirt;
	 It becomes your body best;
	 The cold bleak wind to be your coat,
	 And the cold wind in your breast.
219B.17	 &#145;The steed that you shall ride upon
	 Shall be o the weather snell,
	 Well bridled wi the northern wind,
	 And cold sharp showers o hail.
219B.18	 &#145;The hat you on your head shall wear
	 Shall be o the weather gray,
	 And aye when you come into my sight
	 I&#146;ll wish you were away.&#146;
