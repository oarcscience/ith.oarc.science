# 124A: The Jolly Pindar of Wakefield


    124A.1   IN Wakefield there lives a jolly pinder,
         In Wakefield, all on a green;
         In Wakefield, all on a green;
    124A.2   There is neither knight nor squire, said the pinder,
         Nor baron that is so bold,
         Nor baron that is so bold,
         Dare make a trespasse to the town of Wakefield,
         But his pledge goes to the pinfold.
         But his pledge goes to the pinfold.
    124A.3   All this beheard three witty young men,
         Twas Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John;
         With that they spyed the jolly pinder,
         As he sate under a thorn.
    124A.4   Now turn again, turn again, said the pinder,
         For a wrong way have you gone;
         For you have forsaken the king his highway,
         And made a path over the corn.
    124A.5   O that were great shame, said jolly Robin,
         We being three, and thou but one:
         The pinder leapt back then thirty good foot,
         Twas thirty good foot and one.
    124A.6   He leaned his back fast unto a thorn,
         And his foot unto a stone,
         And there he fought a long summers day,
         A summers day so long,
         Till that their swords, on their broad bucklers,
         Were broken fast unto their hands.
         * * * * *
    124A.7   Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood,
         And my merry men euery one;
         For this is one of the best pinders
         That ever I tryd with sword.
    124A.8   And wilt thou forsake thy pinder his craft,
         And live in [the] green wood with me?
         . . . .
         . . . .
    124A.9   At Michaelmas next my covnant comes out,
         When every man gathers his fee;
         Ile take my blew blade all in my hand,
         And plod to the green wood with thee.
    124A.10  Hast thou either meat or drink, said Robin Hood,
         For my merry men and me?
         . . . .
         . . . .
    124A.11  I have both bread and beef, said the pinder,
         And good ale of the best;
         And that is meat good enough, said Robin Hood,
         For such unbidden guest.
    124A.12  wilt thou forsake the pinder his craft,
         And go to the green wood with me?
         Thou shalt have a livery twice in the year,
         The one green, the other brown [shall be].
    124A.13  If Michaelmas day were once come and gone
         And my master had paid me my fee,
         Then would I set as little by him
         As my master doth set by me.

### 124B: The Jolly Pindar of Wakefield


    124B.*   * * *
         BUT hold y . . hold y . . .  says Robin,
         My merrymen, I bid yee,
         For this [is] one of the best pindars
         That euer I saw with mine eye.
    124B.2   But hast thou any meat, thou iolly pindar,
         For my merrymen and me?
         . . . .
         . . . .
    124B.3   But I haue bread and cheese, sayes the pindar,
         And ale all on the best:
         Thats cheere good enoughe, said Robin,
         For any such vnbidden guest.
    124B.4   But wilt be my man? said good Robin,
         And come and dwell with me?
         And twise in a yeere thy clothing [shall] be changed
         If my man thou wilt bee,
         The tone shall be of light Lincolne greene,
         The tother of Picklory.
    124B.5   Att Michallmas comes a well good time,
         When men haue gotten in their fee;
         Ile sett as litle by my master
         As he now setts by me,
         Ile take my benbowe in my hande,
         And come into the grenwoode to thee.
