<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">105: The Bailiff&#146;s Daughter of Islington</H1>
<PRE>

105.1	THERE was a youth, and a well belovd youth,
	And he was a esquire&#146;s son,
	He loved the bayliff&#146;s daughter dear,
	That lived in Islington.
105.2	She was coy, and she would not believe
	That he did love her so,
	No, nor at any time she would
	Any countenance to him show.
105.3	But when his friends did understand
	His fond and foolish mind,
	They sent him up to fair London,
	An apprentice for to bind.
105.4	And when he had been seven long years,
	And his love he had not seen,
	&#145;Many a tear have I shed for her sake
	When she little thought of me.&#146;
105.5	All the maids of Islington
	Went forth to sport and play;
	All but the bayliff&#146;s daughter dear;
	She secretly stole away.
105.6	She put off her gown of gray,
	And put on her puggish attire;
	She&#146;s up to fair London gone,
	Her true-love to require.
105.7	As she went along the road,
	The weather being hot and dry,
	There was she aware of her true-love,
	At length came riding by.
105.8	She stept to him, as red as any rose,
	And took him by the bridle-ring:
	&#145;I pray you, kind sir, give me one penny,
	To ease my weary limb.&#146;
105.9	&#145;I prithee, sweetheart, canst thou tell me
	Where that thou wast born?&#146;
	&#145;At Islington, kind sir,&#146; said she,
	Where I have had many a scorn.&#146;
105.10	&#145;I prithee, sweetheart, canst thou tell me
	Whether thou dost know
	The bailiff&#146;s daughter of Islington?&#146;
	&#145;She&#146;s dead, sir, long ago.&#146;
105.11	&#145;Then will I sell my goodly steed,
	My saddle and my bow;
	I will into some far countrey,
	Where no man doth me know.&#146;
105.12	&#145;O stay, O stay, thou goodly youth!
	She&#146;s alive, she is not dead;
	Here she standeth by thy side,
	And is ready to be thy bride.&#146;
105.13	&#145;O farewel grief, and welcome joy,
	Ten thousand times and more!
	For now I have seen my own true-love,
	That I thought I should have seen no more.&#146;
