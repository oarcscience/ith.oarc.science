92A.1	BY Arthur&#146;s Dale as late I went
	I heard a heavy moan;
	I heard a ladie lammenting sair,
	And ay she cried Ohone!
92A.2	&#145;Ohon, alas! what shall I do,
	Tormented night and day!
	I never loved a love but ane,
	And now he&#146;s gone away.
92A.3	&#145;But I will do for my true-love
	What ladies woud think sair;
	For seven year shall come and go
	Ere a kaim gang in my hair.
92A.4	&#145;There shall neither a shoe gang on my foot,
	Nor a kaim gang in my hair,
	Nor eer a coal nor candle-light
	Shine in my bower nae mair.&#146;
92A.5	She thought her love had been on the sea,
	Fast sailling to Bee Hom;
	But he was in a quiet chamer,
	Hearing his ladie&#146;s moan.
92A.6	&#145;Be husht, be husht, my ladie dear,
	I pray thee mourn not so;
	For I am deep sworn on a book
	To Bee Hom for to go.&#146;
92A.7	She has gien him a chain of the beaten gowd,
	And a ring with a ruby stone:
	&#145;As lang as this chain your body binds,
	Your blude can never be drawn.
92A.8	&#145;But gin this ring shoud fade or fail,
	Or the stone shoud change its hue,
	Be sure your love is dead and gone,
	Or she has proved untrue.&#146;
92A.9	He had no been at Bonny Bee Hom
	A twelve month and a day,
	Till, looking on his gay gowd ring,
	The stone grew dark and gray.
92A.10	&#145;O ye take my riches to Bee Hom,
	And deal them presentlie,
	To the young that canna, the auld that maunna,
	And the blind that does not see.&#146;
92A.11	Now death has come into his bower,
	And split his heart in twain;
	So their twa souls flew up to heaven,
	And there shall ever remain.

92B.1	IN Lauderdale I chanc&#146;d to walk,
	And heard a lady&#146;s moan,
	Lamenting for her dearest dear,
	And aye she cried, Ohon!
92B.2	&#145;Sure never a maid that eer drew breath
	Had harder fate than me;
	I&#146;d never a lad but one on earth,
	They forc&#146;d him to the sea.
92B.3	&#145;The ale shall neer be brewin o malt,
	Neither by sea nor land,
	That ever mair shall cross my hause,
	Till my love comes to hand.
92B.4	&#145;A handsome lad, wi shoulders broad,
	Gold yellow was his hair;
	None of our Scottish youths on earth
	That with him could compare.&#146;
92B.5	She thought her love was gone to sea,
	And landed in Bahome;
	But he was in a quiet chamber,
	Hearing his lady&#146;s moan.
92B.6	&#145;Why make ye all this moan, lady?
	Why make ye all this moan?
	For I&#146;m deep sworn on a book,
	I must go to Bahome.
92B.7	&#145;Traitors false for to subdue
	Oer seas I&#146;ll make me boun,
	That have trepand our kind Scotchmen,
	Like dogs to ding them down.&#146;
92B.8	&#145;Weell, take this ring, this royal thing,
	Whose virtue is unknown;
	As lang&#146;s this ring&#146;s your body on,
	Your blood shall neer be drawn.
92B.9	&#145;But if this ring shall fade or stain,
	Or change to other hue,
	Come never mair to fair Scotland,
	If ye&#146;re a lover true.&#146;
92B.10	Then this couple they did part,
	With a sad heavy moan;
	The wind was fair, the ship was rare,
	They landed in Bahome.
92B.11	But in that place they had not been
	A month but barely one,
	Till he lookd on his gay gold ring,
	And riven was the stone.
92B.12	Time after this was not expir&#146;d
	A month but scarcely three,
	Till black and ugly was the ring,
	And the stone was burst in three.
92B.13	&#145;Fight on, fight on, you merry men all,
	With you I&#146;ll fight no more;
	I will gang to some holy place,
	Pray to the King of Glore.&#146;
92B.14	Then to the chapel he is gone,
	And knelt most piteouslie,
	For seven days and seven nights,
	Till blood ran frae his knee.
92B.15	&#145;Ye&#146;ll take my jewels that&#146;s in Bahome,
	And deal them liberallie,
	To young that cannot, and old that mannot,
	The blind that does not see.
92B.16	&#145;Give maist to women in child-bed laid,
	Can neither fecht nor flee;
	I hope she&#146;s in the heavens high,
	That died for love of me.&#146;
92B.17	The knights they wrang their white fingers,
	The ladies tore their hair;
	The women that neer had children born,
	In swoon they down fell there.
92B.18	But in what way the knight expir&#146;d,
	No tongue will eer declare;
	So this doth end my mournful song,
	From me ye&#146;ll get nae mair.
