18A.27	&#145;Take 40 daies into spite,
	To heale thy wounds that beene soe wide.
18A.28	&#145;When 40 dayes beene at an end,
	Heere meete thou me both safe and sound.
18A.29	And till thou come to me againe,
	With me thoust leaue thy lady alone.&#146;
18A.30	When 40 dayes was at an end,
	Sir Lyonell of his wounds was healed sound.
18A.31	He tooke with him a litle page,
	He gaue to him good yeomans wage.
18A.32	And as he rode by one hawthorne,
	Even there did hang his hunting horne.
18A.33	He sett his bugle to his mouth,
	And blew his bugle still full south.
18A.34	He blew his bugle lowde and shrill;
