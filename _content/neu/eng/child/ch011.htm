11A.1	THERE was three ladies playd at the ba,
      Refrain:	With a hey ho and a lillie gay
	There came a knight and played oer them a&#146;.
      Refrain:	As the primrose spreads so sweetly
11A.2	The eldest was baith tall and fair,
	But the youngest was beyond compare.
11A.3	The midmost had a graceful mien,
	But the youngest lookd like beautie&#146;s queen.
11A.4	The knight bowd low to a&#146; the three,
	But to the youngest he bent his knee.
11A.5	The ladie turned her head aside,
	The knight he woo&#146;d her to be his bride.
11A.6	The ladie blushd a rosy red,
	And sayd, &#145;Sir knight, I&#146;m too young to wed.&#146;
11A.7	&#145;O ladie fair, give me your hand,
	And I&#146;ll make you ladie of a&#146; my land.&#146;
11A.8	&#145;Sir knight, ere ye my favor win,
	You maun get consent frae a&#146; my kin.&#146;
11A.9	He&#146;s got consent frae her parents dear,
	And likewise frae her sisters fair.
11A.10	He&#146;s got consent frae her kin each one,
	But forgot to spiek to her brother John.
11A.11	Now, when the wedding day was come,
	The knight would take his bonny bride home.
11A.12	And many a lord and many a knight
	Came to behold that ladie bright.
11A.13	And there was nae man that did her see,
	But wishd himself bridegroom to be.
11A.14	Her father dear led her down the stair,
	And her sisters twain they kissd her there.
11A.15	Her mother dear led her thro the closs,
	And her brother John set her on her horse.
11A.16	She leand her oer the saddle-bow,
	To give him a kiss ere she did go.
11A.17	He has taen a knife, baith lang and sharp,
	And stabbd that bonny bride to the heart.
11A.18	She hadno ridden half thro the town,
	Until her heart&#146;s blude staind her gown.
11A.19	&#145;Ride softly on,&#146; says the best young man,
	&#145;For I think our bonny bride looks pale and wan.&#146;
11A.20	&#145;O lead me gently up yon hill,
	And I&#146;ll there sit down, and make my will.&#146;
11A.21	&#145;O what will you leave to your father dear?&#146;
	&#145;The silver-shod steed that brought me here.&#146;
11A.22	&#145;What will you leave to your mother dear?&#146;
	&#145;My velvet pall and my silken gear.&#146;
11A.23	&#145;What will you leave your sister Anne?&#146;
	&#145;My silken scarf and my gowden fan.&#146;
11A.24	at will you leave to your sister Grace?&#146;
	My bloody cloaths to wash and dress.&#146;
11A.25	&#145;What will you leave to your brother John?&#146;
	&#145;The gallows-tree to hang him on.&#146;
11A.26	&#145;What will you leave to your brother John&#146;s wife?&#146;
	&#145;The wilderness to end her life.&#146;
11A.27	This ladie fair in her grave was laid,
	And many a mass was oer her said.
11A.28	But it would have made your heart right sair,
	To see the bridegroom rive his haire.

11[L.1]	When the King o Fairies rode by them a&#146;.
      Refrain:	And the roses they grow sweetlie
11[L.2]	The foremost one was clad in blue;
	He askd at her if she&#146;d be his doo.
11[L.3]	The second of them was clad in red;
	He asked at her if she&#146;d be his bride.
11[L.4]	The next of them was clad in green;
	He askd at her if she&#146;d be his queen.
11[L.5]	&#145;Go you ask at my father then,
	And you may ask at my mother then.
11[L.6]	&#145;You may ask at my sister Ann,
	And not forget my brother John.&#146;

	And I have askd at your mother then.
11[L.8]	&#145;And I have askd at your sister Ann,
	But I&#146;ve quite forgot your brother John.&#146;
11[L.9]	Her father led her down the stair,
	Her mother combd down her yellow hair.
11[L.10]	Her sister Ann led her to the cross,
	And her brother John set her on her horse.
11[L.11]	&#145;Now you are high and I am low,
	Give me a kiss before ye go.&#146;
11[L.12]	She&#146;s lootit down to gie him a kiss,
	He gave her a deep wound and didna miss.
11[L.13]	And with a penknife as sharp as a dart,
	And he has stabbit her to the heart.
11[L.14]	&#145;Ride up, ride up,&#146; says the foremost man,
	&#145;I think our bride looks pale an wan.&#146;
11[L.15]	&#145;Ride up, ride up,&#146; says the middle man,
	&#145;I see her heart&#146;s blude trinkling down.&#146;
11[L.16]	&#145;Ride on, ride,&#146; says the Fairy King,
	&#145;She will be dead lang ere we win hame.&#146;
11[L.17]	&#145;O I wish I was at yonder cross,
	Where my brother John put me on my horse.
11[L.18]	&#145;I wish I was at yonder thorn,
	I wad curse the day that ere I was born.
11[L.19]	&#145;I wish I was at yon green hill,
	Then I wad sit and bleed my fill.&#146;
11[L.20]	&#145;What will you leave your father then?&#146;
	&#145;The milk-white steed that I ride on.&#146;
11[L.21]	&#145;What will you leave your mother then?&#146;
	&#145;My silver Bible and my golden fan.&#146;
11[L.22]	&#145;What will ye leave your sister Ann?&#146;
	&#145;My good lord, to be married on.&#146;
11[L.23]	&#145;What will ye leave your sister Pegg?&#146;
	&#145;The world wide to go and beg.&#146;
11[L.24]	&#145;What will you leave your brother John?&#146;
	&#145;The gallows-tree to hang him on.&#146;
11[L.25]	&#145;What will you leave your brother&#146;s wife?&#146;
	&#145;Grief and sorrow to end her life.&#146;
