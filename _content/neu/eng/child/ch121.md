    121A.1   IN schomer, when the leves spryng,

         So merey doyt the berdys syng
         Yn wodys merey now.
    121A.2   Herkens, god yemen,
         Comley, corteys, and god,
         On of the best that yeuer bare bowe,
         Hes name was Roben Hode.
    121A.3   Roben Hood was the yemans name,
         That was boyt corteys and fre;
         Ffor the loffe of owre ladey,
         All wemen werschepyd he.
    121A.4   Bot as the god yeman stod on a day,
         Among hes mery maney,
         He was ware of a prowd potter,
         Cam dryfyng owyr the ley.
    121A.5   Yonder comet a prod potter, seyde Roben,
         That long hayt hantyd this wey;
         He was neuer so corteys a man
         On peney of pawage to pay.
    121A.6   Y met hem bot at Went-breg, seyde Lytyll John,
         And therefore yeffell mot he the!
         Seche thre strokes he me gafe,
         Yet by my seydys cleffe they.
    121A.7   Y ley forty shillings, seyde Lytyll John,
         To pay het thes same day,
         Ther ys nat a man among hus all
         A wed schall make hem ley.
    121A.8   Here ys forty shillings, seyde Roben,
         More, and thow dar say,
    RRthat  y schall make that prowde potter,
         A wed to me schall he ley.
    121A.9   There thes money they leyde,
         They toke het a yeman to kepe;
         Roben beffore the potter he breyde,
         A[nd] bad hem stond stell.
    121A.10  Handys apon hes hors he leyde,
         And bad the potter stonde foll stell;
         The potter schorteley to hem seyde,
         Ffelow, what ys they well?
    121A.11  All thes thre yer, and more, potter, he seyde,
         Thow hast hantyd thes wey,
         Yet were tow neuer so cortys a man
         On peney of pauage to pay.
    121A.12  What ys they name, seyde the potter,
         Ffor pauage thow aske of me?
         Roben Hod ys mey name,
         A wed schall thow leffe me.
    121A.13  Wed well y non leffe, seyde the potter,
         Nor pavag well y non pay;
         Awey they honde fro mey hors!
         Y well the tene eyls, be mey fay.
    121A.14  The potter to hes cart he went,
         He was not to seke;
         A god to-hande staffe therowt he hent,
         Beffore Roben he leppyd.
    121A.15  Roben howt with a swerd bent,
         A bokeler en hes honde;
         The potter to Roben he went,
         And seyde, Ffelow, let mey hors go.
    121A.16  Togeder then went thes to yemen,
         Het was a god seyt to se;
         Thereof low Robyn hes men,
         There they stod onder a tre.
    121A.17  Leytell John to hes felowhe[s] seyde,
         Yend potter well steffeley stonde:
         The potter, with a acward stroke,
         Smot the bokeler owt of hes honde.
    121A.18  A[nd] ar Roben meyt get het agen
         Hes bokeler at hes fette,
         The potter yn the neke hem toke,
         To the gronde sone he yede.
    121A.19  t saw Roben hes men,
         As thay stod onder a bow;
         Let vs helpe owre master, seyde Lytell John,
         Yonder potter, seyde he,  ls well hem slo.
    121A.20  Thes yemen went with a breyde,
         To ther mast[er] they cam.
         Leytell John to hes mast[er] seyde,

         As y haffe harde weyse men saye,
         Yeffe a pore yeman com drywyng on the wey,
         To let hem of hes gorney.
    121A.23  Be mey trowet, thow seys soyt, seyde Roben,
         Thow seys god yeme[n]rey;
         And thow dreyffe forthe yeuery day,
         Thow schalt neuer be let for me.
    121A.24  Y well prey the, god potter,
         A felischepe well thow haffe?
         Geffe me they clothyng, and thow schalt hafe myne;
         Y well go to Notynggam.
    121A.25  Y gra[n]t thereto, seyde the potter,
         Thow schalt feynde me a felow gode;
         Bot thow can sell mey pottys well,
         Com ayen as thow yode.
    121A.26  Nay, be mey trowt, seyde Roben,
         And then y bescro mey hede,
         Yeffe y bryng eny pottys ayen,
         And eney weyffe well hem chepe.
    121A.27  Than spake Leytell John,
         And all hes felowhes heynd,
         Master, be well ware of the screffe of Notynggam,
         Ffor he ys leytell howr frende.
    121A.28  Heyt war howte! seyde Roben,
         Ffelowhes, let me a lone;
         Thorow the helpe of Howr Ladey,
         To Notynggam well y gon.
    121A.29  Robyn went to Notynggam,
         Thes pottys for to sell;
         The potter abode with Robens men,
         There he fered not eylle.
