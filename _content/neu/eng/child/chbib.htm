<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">LIST OF THE PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF ENGLISH AND SCOTTISH BALLADS AND SONGS.</H3>
<P>[This list does not include (excepting a few reprints) the collections of Songs, Madrigals, "Ballets," &amp;c., published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,--the titles of most of which are to be seen in Rimbault's <I>Bibliotheca Madrigaliana</I>. On the other hand, it does include a few useful books connected with ballad-poetry which would not properly come into a list of collections. The relative importance of the works in this list is partially indicated by difference of type. When two or more editions are mentioned, those used in this collection are distinguished by brackets. A few books which we have not succeeded in finding--all of slight or no importance--are marked with a star.]</P>
