	He hunted itt round about,
	And noebodye that he found therin,
	Nor none there was with-out.

	And he tooke his siluer combe in his hand,
	To kembe his yellow lockes.
83A.3	He sayes, Come hither, thou litle foot-page,
	That runneth lowlye by my knee,
	Ffor thou shalt goe to Iohn Stewards wiffe
	And pray her speake with mee.

	I, and greete thou doe that ladye well,
	Euer soe well froe mee.
83A.5	&#145;And, as itt falls, as many times
	As knotts beene knitt on a kell,
	Or merchant men gone to leeue London,
	Either to buy ware or sell.
83A.6	&#145;And, as itt falles, as many times
	As any hart can thinke,
	Or schoole-masters are in any schoole-house,
	Writting with pen and inke:
	Ffor if I might, as well as shee may,
	This night I wold with her speake.
83A.7	&#145;And heere I send her a mantle of greene,
	As greene as any grasse,
	And bidd her come to the siluer wood,
	To hunt with Child Maurice.
83A.8	&#145;And there I send her a ring of gold,
	A ring of precyous stone,
	And bidd her come to the siluer wood,
	Let for no kind of man.&#146;
83A.9	One while this litle boy he yode,
	Another while he ran,
	Vntill he came to Iohn Stewards hall,

83A.10	And of nurture the child had good,
	Hee ran vp hall and bower free,
	And when he came to this lady faire,
	Sayes, God you saue and see!
	And when he came to this lady faire,
	Sayes, God you saue and see!
	And when he came to this lady faire,

83A.11	&#145;I am come from Ch[i]ld Maurice,
	A message vnto thee;
	And Child Maurice, he greetes you well,
	And euer soe well from mee.
83A.12	&#145;And, as itt falls, as oftentimes
	As knotts beene knitt on a kell,
	Or marchant-men gone to leeue London,
	Either for to buy ware or sell.
83A.13	&#145;And as oftentimes he greetes you well
	As any hart can thinke,
	Or schoolemasters [are] in any schoole,
	Wryting with pen and inke.
83A.14	&#145;And heere he sends a mantle of greene,
	As greene as any grasse,
	And he bidds you come to the siluer wood,
	To hunt with Child Maurice.
83A.15	&#145;And heere he sends you a ring of gold,
	A ring of the precyous stone;
	He prayes you to come to the siluer wood,
	Let for no kind of man.&#146;
83A.16	&#145;Now peace, now peace, thou litle foot-page,
	Ffor Christes sake, I pray thee!
	Ffor if my lord heare one of these words,
	Thou must be hanged hye!&#146;
83A.17	Iohn Steward stood vnder the castle-wall,
	And he wrote the words euerye one,
	. . . . . .
	. . . . .
83A.18	And he called vnto his hors-keeper,
	&#145;Make readye you my steede!&#146;
	I, and soe hee did to his chamberlaine,
	&#145;Make readye thou my weede!&#146;
83A.19	And he cast a lease vpon his backe,
	And he rode to the siluer wood,
	And there he sought all about,
	About the siluer wood.
83A.20	And there he found him Child Maurice
	Sitting vpon a blocke,
	With a siluer combe in his hand,
	Kembing his yellow locke[s.]
	* * * * *
83A.21	But then stood vp him Child Maurice,
	And sayd these words trulye:
	&#145;I doe not know your ladye,&#146; he said,
	&#145;If that I doe her see.&#146;
83A.22	that I doe her see.&#146;
83A.22	He sayes, How now, how now, Child Maurice?
	Alacke, how may this bee?
	Ffor thou hast sent her loue-tokens,
	More now then two or three.
83A.23	&#145;Ffor thou hast sent her a mantle of greene,
	As greene as any grasse,
	And bade her come to the siluer woode,
	To hunt with Child Maurice.
83A.24	&#145;And thou [hast] sent her a ring of gold,
	A ring of the precyous stone,
	And bade her come to the siluer wood,
	Let for no kind of man.&#146;
83A.25	&#145;And by my faith, now, Child Maurice,
	The tone of vs shall dye!&#146;
	&#145;Now be my troth,&#146; sayd Child Maurice,
	&#145;And that shall not be I.&#146;
	And soe fast he smote att Iohn Steward,
83A.26	But hee pulled forth a bright browne sword,
	And dryed itt on the grasse,
	And the first good stroke Iohn Stewart stroke,
	I-wisse he neuer [did] rest.
83A.27	Then hee pulled forth his bright browne sword,
	And dryed itt on his sleeue,
	And the first good stroke Iohn Stewart stroke,
	Child Maurice head he did cleeue.
83A.28	And he pricked itt on his swords poynt,
	Went singing there beside,
	And he rode till he came to that ladye faire,
	Wheras this ladye lyed.
83A.29	And sayes, Dost thou know Child Maurice head,
	If that thou dost itt see?
	And lapp itt soft, and kisse itt offt,
	Ffor thou louedst him better than mee.&#146;
83A.30	But when shee looked on Child Maurice head,
	Shee neuer spake words but three:
	&#145;I neuer beare no child but one,
	And you haue slaine him trulye.&#146;
83A.31	Sayes, Wicked be my merrymen all,
	I gaue meate, drinke, and clothe!
	But cold they not haue holden me
	When I was in all that wrath!
83A.32	&#145;Ffor I haue slaine one of the curteousest knights
That	euer bestrode a steed,
	Soe haue I done one [of] the fairest ladyes
That	euer bestrode a steed,
	Soe haue I done one [of] the fairest ladyes
That	euer ware womans weede!&#146;

83B.1	CHILD NORYCE is a clever young man,
	He wavers wi the wind;
	His horse was silver-shod before,
	With the beaten gold behind.
83B.2	He called to his little man John,
	Saying, You don&#146;t see what I see;
	For O yonder I see the very first woman
	That ever loved me.
83B.3	&#145;Here is a glove, a glove,&#146; he said,
	&#145;Lined with the silver grey;
	You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood,
	To speak to Child Nory.
83B.4	&#145;Here is a ring, a ring,&#146; he says,
	&#145;It&#146;s all gold but the stane;
	You may tell her to come to the merry greenwood,
	And ask the leave o nane.&#146;
83B.5	&#145;So well do I love your errand, my master,
	But far better do I love my life;
	O would ye have me go to Lord Barnard&#146;s castle,
	To betray away his wife?&#146;
83B.6	&#145;O don&#146;t I give you meat,&#146; he says,
	&#145;And don&#146;t I pay you fee?
	How dare you stop my errand?&#146; he says;
	&#145;My orders you must obey.&#146;
83B.7	O when he came to Lord Bernard&#146;s castle,
	He tinkled at the ring;
	Who was as ready as Lord Barnard himself
	To let this little boy in?
83B.8	&#145;Here is a glove, a glove,&#146; he says,
	&#145;Lined with the silver grey;
	You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood,
	To speak to Child Nory.
83B.9	&#145;Here is a ring, a ring,&#146; he says,
	&#145;It&#146;s all gold but the stane;
	You are bidden to come to the merry greenwood,
	And ask the leave o nane.&#146;
83B.10	Lord Barnard he was standing by,
	And an angry man was he:
	&#145;O little did I think there was a lord in the world
	My lady loved but me!&#146;
83B.11	O he dressed himself in the holland smock,
	And garments that was gay,
	And he is away to the merry green-wood,
	To speak to Child Nory.
83B.12	Child Noryce sits on yonder tree,
	He whistles and he sings:
	&#145;O wae be to me,&#146; says Child Noryce,
	&#145;Yonder my mother comes!&#146;
83B.13	Child Noryce he came off the tree,
	His mother to take off the horse:
	&#145;Och alace, alace,&#146; says Child Noryce,
	&#145;My mother was neer so gross!&#146;
83B.14	Lord Barnard he had a little small sword,
	That hung low down by his knee;
	He cut the head off Child Noryce,
	And put the body on a tree.
83B.15	And when he came home to his castell,
	And to his ladie&#146;s hall,
	He threw the head into her lap,
	Saying, Lady, there&#146;s a ball!
83B.16	She turned up the bloody head,
	She kissed it frae cheek to chin:
	&#145;Far better do I love this bloody head
	Than all my royal kin.
83B.17	&#145;When I was in my father&#146;s castel,
	In my virginity,
	There came a lord into the North,
	Gat Child Noryce with me.&#146;
83B.18	&#145;O wae be to thee, Lady Margaret,&#146; he sayd,
	&#145;And an ill death may you die;
	For if you had told me he was your son,
	He had neer been slain by me.&#146;

83E.6	&#145;And here it is a gay manteel,
	It&#146;s a&#146; gowd but the hem;
	Bid her come speak to Chield Morice,
	Bring naebody but her lane.
83E.7	&#145;And here it is a holland smock,
	her own hand sewed the sleeve;
	Bid her come speak to Chield Morice,
	Ask not the baron&#146;s leave.&#146;
83E.8	&#145;Since I must run this errand for you,
	So sore against my will,
	I&#146;ve made a vow, and I&#146;ll keep it true,
	It shall be done for ill.&#146;
83E.9	For he did not ask the porter&#146;s leave,
	Tho he stood at the gate,
	But straight he ran to the big hall,
	Where great folk sat at meat.
83E.10	&#145;Good hallow, gentle sir and dame,
	My errand canno wait;
	Dame, ye must go speak to Chield Morice,
	Before it be too late.
83E.11	&#145;And here it is a gay manteel,
	It&#146;s a&#146; goud but the hem;
	Ye must come speak to Child Morice,
	Bring nae body but your lane.
83E.12	&#145;And here it is a holland smock,
	Your ain hand sewed the sleeve;
	You must come speak to Chield Morice,
	Ask not the baron&#146;s leave.&#146;
83E.13	O aye she stamped wi her foot,
	And winked wi her ee,
	But a&#146; that she could say or do,
	Forbidden he wad na be.
83E.14	&#145;It&#146;s surely to my bouir-woman,
	It canna be to me:&#146;
	&#145;I brocht it to Lord Barnard&#146;s lady,
	And I trow that thou art she.&#146;
83E.15	Out then spak the wylie nurse,
	Wi the bairn just on her knee:
	&#145;If this be come fra Chield Morice,
	It&#146;s dear welcome to me.&#146;
83E.16	&#145;Thou lies, thou lies, thou wylie nurse,
	Sae loud&#146;s I hear thee lie;
	I brought it to Lord Barnard&#146;s lady,
	And I trow thou binna she.&#146;
	I brought it to Lord Barnard&#146;s lady,
	And I trow thou binna she.&#146;
83E.17	Then up and rose him the bold baron,
	And an angry man was he;
	He took the table wi his foot,
	And keppd it wi his knee,
	Till silver cup and ezar dish
	In flinders they did flee.
83E.18	&#145;Go gring me one of thy cleeding,
	That hings upon the pin,
	And I&#146;ll awa to the good green-wood,
	And crack wi your leman.&#146;
83E.19	&#145;I would have you stay at home, Lord Barnard,
	I would have you stay at home;
	Never wyte a man for violence douce
	That never thought you wrong.&#146;
83E.20	And when he to the green-wood went,
	No body saw he there
	But Chield Morice, on a milk-white steed,
	Combing down his yellow hair.
83E.21	Chield Morice sat in the gay green-wood,
	He whistled and he sang:
	&#145;O what means a&#146; thir folks coming?
	My mother tarries lang.&#146;
83E.22	mother tarries lang.&#146;
83E.22	&#145;No wonder, no wonder, Chield Morice,&#146; he said,
	&#145;My lady loved thee weel;
	For the whitest bit of my body
	Is blacker than thy heel.
83E.23	&#145;But nevertheless now, Chield Morice,
	For a&#146; thy gay beautie,
	O nevertheless, Chield Morice,
	Thy head shall go with me.&#146;
83E.24	He had a rapier by his side,
	Hung low down by his knee;
	He struck Chield Morrice on the neck,
	Till aff his head did flee.
83E.25	Then he&#146;s taen up that bloody head,
	And stuck it on a spear,
	And the meanest man in a&#146; his train
	Gat Chield Morice head to bear.
83E.26	The lady looked owre the castle-wa,
	Wi meikle dool and down,
	And there she saw Chield Morice head,
	Coming trailing to the town.
83E.27	But he&#146;s taen up this bluidy head,
	And dashed it gainst the wa:
	&#145;Come down, come down, you ladies fair,
	And play at this foot-ba.&#146;
83E.28	Then she&#146;s taen up this bluidy head,
	And an ill deid may thou die!
	And she kissed it both cheek and chin:
	&#145;I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
	Than a&#146; thy earldom.
	&#145;I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
	Than a&#146; thy earldom.
	&#145;I would rather hae a kiss o that bluidy head
	Than a&#146; thy earldom.
83E.29	&#145;I got him in my father&#146;s bouir,
	Wi meikle sin and shame,
	And I brought him up in gay green-wood,
	Beneath the heavy rain.
83E.30	&#145;Many a day have I rockd thy cradle,
	And fondly seen thee sleep,
	But now I&#146;ll go about thy grave,
	And sore, sore will I weep.&#146;
83E.31	&#145;O woe be to thee, thou wild woman,
	And an ill deid may thou die!
	For if ye had tauld me he was your son,
	He should hae ridden and gane wi me.&#146;
83E.32	&#145;O hold your tongue, you bold baron,
	And an ill death may ye die!
	He had lands and rents enew of his ain,
	He needed nane fra thee.&#146;
83E.33	&#145;Then I&#146;ll curse the hand that did the deed,
	The heart that thought him ill,
	The feet that carried me speedilie
	This comely youth to kill.&#146;
83E.34	This lady she died gin ten o&#146;clock,
	Lord Barnard died gin twall,
	And bonnie boy now, Sweet Willie,
	What&#146;s come o him I canna tell.

83F.1	GIL MORRICE was an erles son,
	His name it waxed wide;
	It was nae for his great riches,
	Nor yet his mickle pride,
	Bot it was for a lady gay,
	That livd on Carron side.
83F.2	&#145;Whair sall I get a bonny boy,

83F.13	And when he came to broken brigue,
	He bent his bow and swam;
	And when [he] came to grass growing,
	Set down his feet and ran.
83F.14	And when he came to Barnard&#146;s ha,
	Would neither chap nor ca,
	Bot set his bent bow to his breist,
	And lichtly lap the wa.
83F.15	He wauld nae tell the man his errand,
	Though he stude at the gait;
	Bot straiht into the ha he cam,
	Whair they were set at meit.
83F.16	&#145;Hail! hail! my gentle sire and dame,

	Forbidden he wad nae bee.
83F.20	&#145;It&#146;s surely to my bowr-woman;
	It neir could be to me:&#146;
	&#145;I brocht it to Lord Barnard&#146;s lady;
	I trow that ye be she.&#146;
83F.21	Then up and spack the wylie nurse,
	The bairn upon hir knee:

	I trow ye be nae shee.&#146;
83F.23	Then up and spack the bauld baron,
	An angry man was hee;
	He&#146;s tain the table wi his foot,
	Sae has he wi his knee,
	Till siller cup and ezar dish
	In flinders he gard flee.
83F.24	&#145;Gae bring a robe of your cliding,

83F.26	Gil Morice sate in gude grene-wode,
	He whistled and he sang:
	&#145;O what mean a&#146; the folk coming?
	My mother tarries lang.&#146;
83F.27	The baron came to the grene-wode,
	Wi mickle dule and care,
	And there he first spied Gill Morice,
	Kameing his yellow hair.
83F.28	&#145;Nae wonder, nae wonder, Gill Morice,
	My lady loed thee weel;
	The fairest part of my body
	Is blacker than thy heel.
83F.29	&#145;Yet neir the less now, Gill Morice,
	For a&#146; thy great bewty,
	Ye&#146;s rew the day ye eir was born;
	That head sall gae wi me.&#146;
83F.30	Now he has drawn his trusty brand,

	And thro Gill Morice fair body
	He&#146;s gard cauld iron gae.
83F.31	And he has tain Gill Morice head,
	And set it on a speir;
	The meanest man in a&#146; his train
	Has gotten that head to bear.
83F.32	And he has tain Gill Morice up,
	Laid him across his steid,
	And brocht him to his painted bowr,
	And laid him on a bed.
83F.33	The lady sat on castil-wa,
	Beheld baith dale and doun,
	And there she saw Gill Morice head
	Cum trailing to the toun.
83F.34	&#145;Far better I loe that bluidy head,
	Bot and that yellow hair,
	Than Lord Barnard, and a&#146; his lands,
	As they lig here and thair.&#146;
83F.35	And she has tain hir Gill Morice,
	And kissd baith mouth and chin:
	&#145;I was once as fow of Gill Morice
	As the hip is o the stean.

	Wi mickle sin and shame;
	I brocht thee up in gude green-wode,
	Under the heavy rain.

	And fondly seen thee sleip;
	Bot now I gae about thy grave,
	The saut tears for to weip.&#146;
83F.38	And syne she kissd his bluidy cheik,
	And syne his bluidy chin:
	&#145;O better I loe my Gill Morice
	Than a&#146; my kith and kin!&#146;
