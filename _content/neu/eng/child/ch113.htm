<PRE>

113.1	 AN eartly nourris sits and sing,
	 And aye she sings, Ba, lily wean!
	 Little ken I my bairnis father,
	 Far less the land that he staps in.
113.2	 Then ane arose at her bed-fit,
	 An a grumly guest I&#146;m sure was he:
	 &#145;Here am I, thy bairnis father,
	 Although that I be not comelie.
113.3	 &#145;I am a man, upo the lan,
	 An I am a silkie in the sea;
	 And when I&#146;m far and far frae lan,
	 My dwelling is in Sule Skerrie.&#146;
113.4	 &#145;It was na weel,&#146; quo the maiden fair,
	 &#145;It was na weel, indeed,&#146; quo she,
	 &#145;That the Great Silkie of Sule Skerrie
	 Suld hae come and aught a bairn to me.&#146;
113.5	 Now he has taen a purse of goud,
	 And he has pat it upo her knee,
	 Sayin, Gie to me my little young son,
	 An tak thee up thy nourris-fee.
113.6	 An it sall come to pass on a simmer&#146;s day,
	 When the sin shines het on evera stane,
	 That I will tak my little young son,
	 An teach him for to swim the faem.
113.7	 An thu sall marry a proud gunner,
	 An a proud gunner I&#146;m sure he&#146;ll be,
	 An the very first schot that ere he schoots,
	 He&#146;ll schoot baith my young son and me.
