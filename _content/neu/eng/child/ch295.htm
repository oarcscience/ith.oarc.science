<PRE>

295A.1	 &#145;I am as brown as brown can be,
	 My eyes as black as a sloe;
	 I am as brisk as a nightingale,
	 And as wilde as any doe.
295A.2	 &#145;My love has sent me a love-letter,
	 Not far from yonder town,
	 That he could not fancy me,
	 Because I was so brown.
295A.3	 &#145;I sent him his letter back again,
	 For his love I valu&#146;d not,
	 Whether that he could fancy me
	 Or whether he could not.
295A.4	 &#145;He sent me his letter back again,
	 That he lay dangerous sick,
	 That I might then go speedily
	 To give him up his faith.&#146;
295A.5	 Now you shall hear what love she had
	 Then for this love-sick man;
	 She was a whole long summer&#146;s day
	 In a mile a going on.
295A.6	 When she came to her love&#146;s bed-side,
	 Where he lay dangerous sick,
	 She could not for laughing stand
	 Upright upon her feet.
295A.7	 She had a white wand all in her hand,
	 And smoothd it all on his breast;
	 &#145;In faith and troth come pardon me,
	 I hope your soul&#146;s at rest.
295A.8	 &#145;I&#146;ll do as much for my true-love
	 As other maidens may;
	 I&#146;ll dance and sing on my love&#146;s grave
	 A whole twelvemonth and a day.&#146;

295B.1	 &#145;I am as brown as brown can be,
	 And my eyes as black as sloe;
	 I am as brisk as brisk can be,
	 And wild as forest doe.
295B.2	 &#145;My love he was so high and proud,
	 His fortune too so high,
	 He for another fair pretty maid
	 Me left and passed me by.
295B.3	 &#145;Me did he send a love-letter,
	 He sent it from the town,
	 Saying no more he loved me,
	 For that I was so brown.
295B.4	 &#145;I sent his letter back again,
	 Saying his love I valued not,
	 Whether that he would fancy me,
	 Whether that he would not.
295B.5	 &#145;When that six months were overpassd,
	 Were overpassd and gone,
	 Then did my lover, once so bold,
	 Lie on his bed and groan.
295B.6	 &#145;When that six months were overpassd,
	 Were gone and overpassd,
	 O then my lover, once so bold,
	 With love was sick at last.
295B.7	 &#145;First sent he for the doctor-man:
	 &#145;You, doctor, me must cure;
	 The pains that now do torture me
	 I can not long endure.&#146;
295B.8	 &#145;Next did he send from out the town,
	 O next did send for me;
	 He sent for me, the brown, brown girl
	 Who once his wife should be.
295B.9	 &#145;O neer a bit the doctor-man
	 His sufferings could relieve;
	 O never an one but the brown, brown girl
	 Who could his life reprieve.&#146;
295B.10	 Now you shall hear what love she had
	 For this poor love-sick man,
	 How all one day, a summer&#146;s day,
	 She walked and never ran.
295B.11	 When that she came to his bedside,
	 Where he lay sick and weak,
	 O then for laughing she could not stand
	 Upright upon her feet.
295B.12	 &#145;You flouted me, you scouted me,
	 And many another one;
	 Now the reward is come at last,
	 For all that you have done.&#146;
295B.13	 The rings she took from off her hands,
	 The rings by two and three:
	 &#145;O take, O take these golden rings,
	 By them remember me.&#146;
295B.14	 She had a white wand in her hand,
	 She strake him on the breast:
	 &#145;My faith and troth I give back to thee,
	 So may thy soul have rest.&#146;
295B.15	 &#145;Prithee,&#146; said he, &#146;Forget, forget,
	 Prithee forget, forgive;
	 O grant me yet a little space,
	 That I may be well and live.&#146;
295B.16	 &#145;O never will I forget, forgive,
	 So long as I have breath;
	 I&#146;ll dance above your green, green grave
	 Where you do lie beneath.&#146;
