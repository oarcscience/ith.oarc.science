### 25\[E\]: Willie’s Lyke-Wake


    25[E].1 If my love loves me, she lets me not know,
        That is a dowie chance;
        I wish that I the same could do,
        Tho my love were in France, France,
        Tho my love were in France.
    25[E.2] O lang think I, and very lang,
        And lang think I, I true;
        But lang and langer will I think
        Or my love o me rue.
    25[E.3] I will write a broad letter,
        And write it sae perfite,
        That an she winna o me rue,
        Ill bid her come to my lyke.
    25[E.4] Then he has written a broad letter,
        And seald it wi his hand,
        And sent it on to his true love,
        As fast as boy could gang.
    25[E.5] When she looked the letter upon,
        A light laugh then gae she;
        But ere she read it to an end,
        The tear blinded her ee.
    25[E.6] O saddle to me a steed, father,
        O saddle to me a steed;
        For word is come to me this night,
        That my true love is dead.
    25[E.7] The steeds are in the stable, daughter,
        The keys are casten by;
        Ye cannot won to-night, daughter,
        To-morrow yese won away.
    25[E.8] She has cut aff her yellow locks,
        A little aboon her ee,
        And she is on to Willies lyke,
        As fast as gang could she.
    25[E.9] As she gaed ower yon high hill head,
        She saw a dowie light;
        It was the candles at Willies lyke,
        And torches burning bright.
    25[E.10]    Three o Willies eldest brothers
        Were making for him a bier;
        One half o it was gude red gowd,
        The other siller clear.
    25[E.11]    Three o Willies eldest sisters
        Were making for him a sark;
        The one half o it was cambric fine,
        The other needle wark.
    25[E.12]    Out spake the youngest o his sisters,
        As she stood on the fleer:
        How happy would our brother been,
        If yed been sooner here!
    25[E.13]    She lifted up the green covering,
        And gae him kisses three;
        Then he lookd up into her face,
        The blythe blink in his ee.
    25[E.14]    O then he started to his feet,
        And thus to her said he:
        Fair Annie, since were met again,
        Parted nae mair wese be.
