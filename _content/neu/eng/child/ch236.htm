<PRE>

236A.1	 O IT fell out upon a day,
	 When Drums was going to ride, O
	 And there he met with a well-far&#146;d may,
	 Keeping her flocks on yon side. O
236A.2	 &#145;O fair may, O rare may,
	 Can not you fancy me?
	 Of a&#146; the lasses here about
	 I like nane so well as thee.&#146;
236A.3	 &#145;Set your love on another, kind sir,
	 Set it not on me,
	 For I&#146;m not fit to be your bride,
	 And your whore I&#146;ll never be.&#146;
236A.4	 Drums is to her father gane,
	 Keeping his flocks on yon hill,
	 And he has gotten his consent,
	 And the maid was at his will.
236A.5	 &#145;My daughter can neither read nor write,
	 She was neer brought up at school;
	 But well can she milk cow and ewe,
	 And make a kebbuck well.
236A.6	 &#145;She&#146;ll winn in your barn at bear-seed time,
	 Cast out your muck at Yule;
	 She&#146;ll saddle your steed in time o need,
	 Draw aff your boots hersell.&#146;
236A.7	 &#145;Have not I no clergymen?
	 Pay I no clergy fee?
	 I&#146;ll school her as I think fit,
	 And as I think fit to be.&#146;
236A.8	 Drums is to the Highlands gane
	 For to be made ready,
	 And a&#146; the gentry thereabout
	 Says, Yonder comes Drums and his lady.
236A.9	 &#145;Peggy Coutts is a very bonnie bride,
	 And Drums is a wealthy laddie;
	 But Drums might hae chosen a higher match
	 Than any shepherd&#146;s daughter.&#146;
236A.10	 Then up bespake his brother John,
	 Says, Brother you&#146;ve done us wrong;
	 You&#146;ve married ane below our degree,
	 A stain to a&#146; our kin.
236A.11	 &#145;Hold your tongue, my brother John,
	 I have done you no wrong;
	 For I&#146;ve married ane to wirk and win,
	 And ye&#146;ve married ane to spend.
236A.12	 &#145;The last time that I had a wife,
	 She was above my degree;
	 I durst not come in her presence
	 But with my hat on my knee.&#146;
236A.13	 There was four-and-twenty gentlemen
	 Stood at the yetts o Drum;
	 There was na ane amang them a&#146;
	 That welcomd his lady in.
236A.14	 He&#146;s taen her by the milk-white hand
	 And led her in himsell,
	 And in thro ha&#146;s and thro bowers,
	 &#145;And you&#146;re welcome, Lady o Drum.&#146;
236A.15	 Thrice he kissd her cherry cheek,
	 And thrice her cherry chin,
	 And twenty times her comely mouth,
	 &#145;And you&#146;re welcome, Lady o Drum.&#146;
236A.16	 &#145;Ye shall be cook in my kitchen,
	 Butler in my ha;
	 Ye shall be lady at my command
	 When I ride far awa.&#146;
236A.17	 &#145;But what will I do when auld Drum dies,
	 When auld Drum dies and leaves me?
	 Then I&#146;ll tak back my word again,
	 And the Coutts will come and see me.&#146;

236D.1	 THE laird o Drum is a hunting gane,
	 All in a morning early,
	 And he did spy a well-far&#146;d may,
	 Was shearing at her barley.
236D.2	 &#145;O will ye fancy me, fair may,
	 And let your shearing be, O
	 And gang and be the lady o Drum?
	 O will ye fancy me?&#146; O
236D.3	 &#145;I winna fancy you,&#146; she says,
	 &#145;Nor let my shearing be;
	 For I&#146;m ower low to be Lady Drum,
	 And your miss I&#146;d scorn to be.&#146;
236D.4	 &#145;But ye&#146;ll cast aff that gown o grey,
	 Put on the silk and scarlet;
	 I&#146;ll make a vow, and keep it true,
	 You&#146;ll neither be miss nor harlot.&#146;
236D.5	 &#145;Then dee you to my father dear,
	 Keeps sheep on yonder hill;
	 To ony thing he bids me do
	 I&#146;m always at his will.&#146;
236D.6	 He has gane to her father dear,
	 Keeps sheep on yonder hill:
	 &#145;I&#146;m come to marry your ae daughter,
	 If ye&#146;ll gie me your gude will.&#146;
236D.7	 &#145;She&#146;ll shake your barn, and winna your corn,
	 And gang to mill and kill;
	 In time of need she&#146;ll saddle your steed;
	 And I&#146;ll draw your boots mysell.&#146;
236D.8	 &#145;O wha will bake my bridal bread,
	 And wha will brew my ale,
	 And wha will welcome my lady hame,
	 It&#146;s mair than I can tell.&#146;
236D.9	 Four and twenty gentle knights
	 Gied in at the yetts o Drum;
	 But nae a man lifted his hat
	 Whan the lady o Drum came in.
236D.10	 But he has taen her by the hand,
	 And led her but and ben;
	 Says, You&#146;r welcome hame, my lady Drum,
	 For this is your ain land.
236D.11	 For he has taen her by the hand,
	 And led her thro the ha;
	 Says, You&#146;r welcome hame, my lady Drum,
	 To your bowers ane and a&#146;.
236D.12	 Then he[&#146;s] stript her o the robes o grey,
	 Drest her in the robes o gold,
	 And taen her father the sheep-keeping,
	 Made him a bailie bold.
236D.13	 She wasna forty weeks his wife
	 Till she brought hame a son;
	 She was as well a loved lady
	 As ever was in Drum.
236D.14	 Out it speaks his brother dear,
	 Says, You&#146;ve dune us great wrang;
	 You&#146;ve married a wife below your degree,
	 She&#146;s a mock to all our kin.
236D.15	 Out then spake the Laird of Drum,
	 Says, I&#146;ve dune you nae wrang;
	 I&#146;ve married a wife to win my bread,
	 You&#146;ve married ane to spend.
236D.16	 &#145;For the last time that I was married,
	 She was far abeen my degree;
	 She wadna gang to the bonny yetts o Drum
	 But the pearlin abeen her ee,
	 And I durstna gang in the room where she was
	 But my hat below my knee.&#146;
236D.17	 When they had eaten and well drunken,
	 And all men bound for bed,
	 The Laird o Drum and his lady gay
	 In ae bed they were laid.
236D.18	 &#145;Gin ye had been o high renown,
	 As ye are o low degree,
	 We might hae baith gane down the streets
	 Amang gude companie.&#146;
236D.19	 &#145;I tauld you ere we were wed
	 You were far abeen my degree;
	 But now I&#146;m married, in your bed laid,
	 And just as gude as ye.
236D.20	 &#145;Gin ye were dead, and I were dead,
	 And baith in grave had lain,
	 Ere seven years were at an end,
	 They&#146;d not ken your dust frae mine.&#146;

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">236E: The Laird o Drum</H3>

236E.1	 THE Laird of Drum is a wooing gane,
	 All in a morning early,
	 And there he spied a weel-far&#146;d may,
	 She was shearing at her barley.
236E.2	 &#145;Will you fancy me, my bonny may,
	 And will you fancy me? O
	 And will you come and be Lady Drum,
	 And let your shearing a be?&#146; O
236E.3	 &#145;It&#146;s I winna fancy you, kind sir,
	 I winna fancy thee;
	 For I&#146;m too low to be lady o Drum,
	 And your whore I would scorn to be.&#146;
236E.4	 Ye&#146;ll cast aff the robes of gray,
	 And put on the silk and the scarlet,
	 And here to you I&#146;ll make a vow
	 Ye&#146;se neither be whore nor harlot.&#146;
236E.5	 &#145;I winna cast aff the robes o gray,
	 To put on the silk and the scarlet,
	 But I&#146;ll wear the colour of the ewe,
	 For they set me better that a&#146; that.
236E.6	 &#145;But ye&#146;ll do you doun to my father dear,
	 Keeping sheep on yonder hill,
	 And the first ae thing that he bids me I&#146;ll do,
	 For I wirk aye at his will.&#146;
236E.7	 He&#146;s done him doun to her father dear,
	 Keeping sheep on yonder hill:
	 &#145;Ye hae a pretty creature for your daughter;
	 Dear me! but I like her well.&#146;
236E.8	 &#145;It&#146;s she can neither read nor write,
	 She was never brought up at the squeel;
	 She canna wash your china cups,
	 Nor yet mak a dish o tea.
236E.9	 &#145;But well can she do a&#146; ither thing,
	 For I learnt the girly mysell;
	 She&#146;ll fill in your barn, and winnow your corn,
	 She&#146;ll gang to your kill and your mill,
	 And, time o need, she&#146;ll saddle your steed,
	 And draw your boots hersell.&#146;
236E.10	 &#145;Wha will bake my bridal bread,
	 And wah will brew my ale?
	 Wha will welcome my lady in?
	 For it&#146;s more than I can tell.&#146;
236E.11	 There was four-and-twenty gentlemen
	 Stood a&#146; in the yetts o Drum,
	 But there was nane o them lifted their hats
	 To welcome the young lady in.
236E.12	 But up spake his ae brither,
	 Says, Brither, ye hae done wrang;
	 Ye have married a wife this day
	 A lauch to a&#146; our kin.
236E.13	 &#145;I&#146;ve married ane to win my bread,
	 But ye married ane to spend;
	 But as lang&#146;s I&#146;m able to walk to the yetts o Drum
	 On me she may depend.
236E.14	 &#145;The last lady that I did wed
	 Was far above my command;
	 I durst not enter the bower where she was
	 But my hat low in my hand.&#146;
236E.15	 When bells were rung, and mass was sung,
	 And a&#146; man bound for bed,
	 The Laird o Drum and the Shepherd&#146;s dother
	 In one bed they were laid.
236E.16	 &#145;If ye were come o noble bleed
	 An were as high as me,
	 We could gang to the yetts o Drum
	 Amangst gueed companie.&#146;
236E.17	 &#145;I tald you ere we was wed
	 I was oer low for thee,
	 But now we are wedd and in ae bed laid,
	 And you must be content wi me.
236E.18	 &#145;For an ye were dead, an I were dead,
	 And laid in the dust low down,
	 When we were baith turnd up again
	 Wha could ken your mould frae mine?&#146;

236F.1	 &#145;OH, will ye fancy me, fair maid?
	 Oh, will ye fancy me? O
	 Or will ye go to be ladye o the Drum,
	 An let a&#146; your shearin abe? O

	 An keep a hoose richt weel.
236F.3	 &#145;My faither he&#146;s a puir shepherd-man,
	 Herds his hogs on yonder hill;
	 Gin ye will go get his consent,
	 Then I&#146;ll be at your call.&#146;
236F.4	 He has gane to her father,
	 That herds hogs on yonder hill;

	 I&#146;d fain tak her to my sel.&#146;
236F.5	 &#145;She can neither read nor write,
	 Was neer brocht up at schule;
	 But she can do all other things,
	 An I learnt aye the lassie my sel.
236F.6	 &#145;She&#146;ll milk your cows, she&#146;ll carry your corn,
	 She&#146;ll gang to the mill or the kiln;
	 She&#146;ll saddle your steed at any time of need,
	 And she&#146;ll brush up your boots hersel.&#146;
236F.7	 &#145;It&#146;s who will bake my bridal bread?
	 Or who will brew my ale?
	 Or who will welcome this bonnie lassie in?
	 For it&#146;s more than I can tell.&#146;
236F.8	 There&#146;s four-and-twenty gentlemen
	 Stand doun at the gate o the Drum;
	 Not one of them all would take off his hat
	 For to welcome the bonnie lassie in.
236F.9	 . . . .
	 . . . .
	 &#145;Oh, brother, you&#146;ve married a wife this day
	 A disgrace to all our kin.&#146;
236F.10	 &#145;Oh, brother, I&#146;ve married a wife to win,
	 And ye&#146;ve got one to spen,
	 And as long as the bonnie lassie walks out and in
	 She shall aye be the ladye o the Drum.&#146;
236F.11	 When all was done, and no bells rung,
	 And all men bound for their bed,
	 The laird and the shepherd&#146;s bonnie daughter
	 In one bed they were laid.
236F.12	 &#145;Though I&#146;m not of as noble blood,
	 Nor yet of as high degree,
	 Now I lie locked in your arms two,
	 And you must be contented wi me.
236F.13	 &#145;If you were dead, and I were dead,
	 And baith laid in one grave,
	 If we were baith to be raised up again,
	 Wha would ken your dust frae mine?
