<PRE>

276A.1	 As I lay musing all alone,
	 fa, la, la, la, la
	 A pretty jeast I thought upon;
	 fa, la, la, la, la
	 Then listen a while, and I will you tell
	 Of a fryer that loved a bonny lass well.
	 fa, la, la, la, la
	 fa, la, la, lang-tre-down-dilly
276A.2	 He came to the maid when she went to bed,
	 Desiring to have her maidenhead,
	 But she deny d his desire,
	 And told him that she feard hell-fire.
276A.3	 &#145;Tush,&#146; quoth the fryer, &#146;Thou needst not doubt
	 If thou wert in hell I could sing thee out:&#146;
	 &#145;Then,&#146; quoth the maid, &#146;Thou shalt have thy request;&#146;
	 The fryer was glad as a fox in his nest.
276A.4	 &#145;But one thing,&#146; quoth she, &#145;I do desire,
	 Before you have what you require;
	 Before that you shall do the thing,
	 An angel of mony thou shalt me bring.&#146;
276A.5	 &#145;Tush,&#146; quoth the fryer, &#146;we shall agree,
	 No mony shall part my love and me;
	 Before that I will see thee lack,
	 I&#146;le pawn the grey gown from my back.&#146;
276A.6	 The maid bethought her of a wile
	 How she the fryer might bequile;
	 While he was gone, the truth to tell,
	 She hung a cloth before the well.
276A.7	 The fryer came, as his covenant was,
	 With money to his bonny lass;
	 &#145;Good morrow, fair maid!&#146; &#145;Good morrow!&#146; quoth she.
	 &#145;Here is the mony I promised thee.&#146;
276A.8	 thankt the man, and she took his mony:
	 &#145;Now let us go to &#146;t,&#146; quoth he, &#146;Sweet hony:&#146;
	 &#145;O stay,&#146; quoth she, &#146;Some respite make,
	 My father comes, he will me take.&#146;
276A.9	 &#145;Alas!&#146; quoth the fryer, &#146;where shall I run,
	 To hide me till that he be gone?&#146;
	 &#145;Behinde the cloath run thou,&#146; quoth she,
	 &#145;And there my father cannot thee see.&#146;
276A.10	 Behind the cloath the fryer crept,
	 And into the well on the sudden he leapt;
	 &#145;Alas,&#146; quoth he, &#146;i am in the well!&#146;
	 &#145;No matter,&#146; quoth she, &#146;if thou wert in hell.
276A.11	 &#145;Thou sayst thou couldst sing me out of hell,
	 Now prithee sing thy self out of the well:&#146;
	 The fryer sung with a pittiful sound,
	 Oh help me out, or I shall be dround!
276A.12	 &#145;I trow,&#146; quoth she, &#146;your courage is coold.&#146;
	 Quoth the fryer, I was never so foold,
	 I never was serv d so before.
	 &#145;Then take heed,&#146; quoth she, &#146;Thou comst there no more.&#146;
276A.13	 Quoth he, For sweet Saint Francis sake
	 On his disciple some pitty take:
	 Quoth she, Saint Francis never taught
	 His scholars to tempt young maids to naught.
276A.14	 The fryer did entreat her still
	 That she should help him out of the well;
	 She heard him make such pittious moan
	 She helpd him out, and bid him be gone.
276A.15	 Quoth he, Shall I have my mony again,
	 Which thou from me hast beforehand tane?
	 &#145;Good sir,&#146; said she, &#146;There&#146;s no such matter;
	 I&#146;le make you pay for fouling my water.&#146;
276A.16	 The fryer went all along the street,
	 Droping wet, like a new-washd sheep;
	 Both old and young commended the maid
	 That such a witty prank had plaid.

276B.1	 O HEARKEN and hear, and I will you tell
	 Sing, Faldidae, faldidadi
	 Of a friar that loved a fair maiden well.
	 Sing, Faldi dadi di di (bis)
276B.2	 The friar he came to this maiden&#146;s bedside,
	 And asking for her maidenhead.
276B.3	 &#145;O I would grant you your desire,
	 If &#146;twerena for fear o hell&#146;s burning fire.&#146;
276B.4	 &#145;O hell&#146;s burning fire ye need have no doubt;
	 Altho you were in, I could whistle you out.&#146;
276B.5	 &#145;O if I grant to you this thing,
	 Some money you unto me must bring.&#146;
276B.6	 He brought her the money, and did it down tell;
	 She had a white cloth spread over the well.
276B.7	 Then the fair maid cried out that her master was come;
	 &#145;O,&#146; said the friar, &#146;Then where shall I run?&#146;
276B.8	 &#145;O ye will go in behind yon screen,
	 And then by my master ye winna be seen.&#146;
276B.9	 n in behind the screen she him sent.
	 But he fell into the well by accident.
276B.10	 Then the friar cried out with a piteous moan,
	 O help! O help me! or else I am gone.
276B.11	 &#145;Ye said ye wad whistle me out o hell;
	 Now whistle your ain sel out o the well.&#146;
276B.12	 She helped him out and bade him be gone;
	 The friar he asked his money again.
276B.13	 &#145;As for your money, there is no much matter
	 To make you pay more for jumbling our water.&#146;
276B.14	 Then all who hear it commend this fair maid
	 For the nimble trick to the friar she played.
276B.15	 friar he walked on the street,
	 And shaking his lugs like a well-washen sheep.
