# 85A: Lady Alice


    85A.1   LADY ALICE was sitting in her bower-window,
        Mending her midnight quoif,
        And there she saw as fine a corpse
        As ever she saw in her life.
    85A.2   What bear ye, what bear ye, ye six men tall?
        What bear ye on your shoulders?
        We bear the corpse of Giles Collins,
        An old and true lover of yours.
    85A.3   O lay him down gently, ye six men tall,
        All on the grass so green,
        And tomorrow, when the sun goes down,
        Lady Alice a corpse shall be seen.
    85A.4   And bury me in Saint Marys church,
        All for my love so true,
        And make me a garland of marjoram,
        And of lemon-thyme, and rue.
    85A.5   Giles Collins was buried all in the east,
        Lady Alice all in the west,
        And the roses that grew on Giles Collinss grave,
        They reached Lady Alices breast.
    85A.6   The priest of the parish he chanced to pass,
        And he severed those roses in twain;
        Sure never were seen such true lovers before,
        Nor eer will there be again.

### 85B: Lady Alice


    85B.1   GILES COLLINS he said to his old mother,
        Mother, come bind up my head,
        And sent to the parson of our parish,
        For tomorrow I shall be dead. dead,
        For tomorrow I shall be dead.
    85B.2   His mother she made him some water-gruel,
        And stirrd it round with a spoon;
        Giles Collins he ate up his water-gruel,
        And died before twas noon.
    85B.3   Lady Anna was sitting at her window,
        Mending her night-robe and coif;
        She saw the very prettiest corpse
        Shed seen in all her life.
    85B.4   What bear ye there, ye six strong men,
        Upon your shoulders so high?
        We bear the body of Giles Collins,
        Who for love of you did die.
    85B.5   Set him down, set him down, Lady Anna she cryd,
        On the grass that grows so green;
        Tomorrow, before the clock strikes ten,
        My body shall lye by hisn.
    85B.6   Lady Anna was buried in the east,
        Giles Collins was buried in the west;
        There grew a lilly from Giles Collins
        That touchd Lady Annas breast.
    85B.7   There blew a cold north-easterly wind,
        And cut this lilly in twain,
        Which never there was seen before,
        And it never will again.

### 85\[C\]: Lady Alice


    85[C].1 Giles Collin he said to his mother one day,
        Oh, mother, come bind up my head!
        For tommorow morning before it is day
        Im sure I shall be dead.
    85[C.2] Oh, mother, oh, mother, if I should die,
        And I am sure I shall,
        I will not be buried in our churchyard,
        But under Lady Alices wall.
    85[C.3] His mother she made him some water-gruel,
        And stirred it up with a spoon;
        Giles Collin he ate but one spoonful,
        And died before it was noon.
    85[C.4] Lady Alice was sitting in her window,
        All dressed in her night-coif;
        She saw as pretty a corpse go by
        As ever shed seen in her life.
    85[C.5] What bear ye there, ye six tall men?
        What bear ye on your shourn?
        We bear the body of Giles Collin,
        Who was a true lover of yourn.
    85[C.6] Down with him, down with him, upon the grass,
        The grass that grows so green;
        For tomorrow morning before it is day
        My body shall lie by him.
    85[C.7] Her mother she made her some plum-gruel,
        With spices all of the best;
        Lady Alice she ate but one spoonful,
        And the doctor he ate up the rest.
    85[C.8] Giles Collin was laid in the lower chancel,
        Lady Alice all in the higher;
        There grew up a rose from Lady Alices breast,
        And from Giles Collins a briar.
    85[C.9] And they grew, and they grew, to the very church-top,
        Until they could grow no higher,
        And twisted and twined in a true-lovers knot,
        Which made all the parish admire.
