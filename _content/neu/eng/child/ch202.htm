<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">202A: The Battle of Philiphaugh</H1>
<PRE>

202A.1	 ON Philiphaugh a fray began,
	 At Hairheadwood it ended;
	 The Scots outoer the Gra+emes they ran,
	 Sae merrily they bended.
202A.2	 Sir David frae the Border came,
	 Wi heart an hand came he;
	 Wi him three thousand bonny Scots,
	 To bear him company.
202A.3	 Wi him three thousand valiant men,
	 A noble sight to see!
	 A cloud o mist them weel conceald,
	 As close as eer might be.
202A.4	 When they came to the Shaw burn,
	 Said he, Sae weel we frame,
	 I think it is convenient
	 That we should sing a psalm.
202A.5	 When they came to the Lingly burn,
	 As daylight did appear,
	 They spy&#146;d an aged father,
	 And he did draw them near.
202A.6	 &#145;Come hither, aged father,&#146;
	 Sir David he did cry,
	 &#145;And tell me where Montrose lies,
	 With al his great army.&#146;
202A.7	 &#145;But first you must come tell to me,
	 If friends or foes you be;
	 I fear you are Montrose&#146;s men,
	 Come frae the north country.&#146;
202A.8	 &#145;No, we are nane o Montrose&#146;s men,
	 Nor eer intend to be;
	 I am Sir David Lesly,
	 That&#146;s speaking unto thee.&#146;
202A.9	 "[If you&#146;re Sir David Lesly,
	 As I think weel ye be,
	 I am sorry ye hae brought so few
	 Into your company.
202A.10	 &#145;There&#146;s fifteen thousand armed men
	 Encamped on yon lee;
	 Ye&#146;ll never be a bite to them,
	 For aught that I can see.
202A.11	 &#145;But halve your men in equal parts,
	 Your purpose to fulfill;
	 Let ae half keep the water-side,
	 The rest gae round the hill.
202A.12	 &#145;Your nether party fire must,
	 Then beat a flying drum;
	 And then they&#146;ll think the day&#146;s their ain,
	 And frae the trench they&#146;ll come.
202A.13	 &#145;Then, those that are behind them maun
	 Gie shot, baith grit and sma;
	 And so, between your armies twa,
	 Ye may make them to fa.&#146;
202A.14	 &#145;O were ye ever a soldier?&#146;
	 Sir David Lesly said;
	 &#145;O yes; I was at Solway Flow,
	 Where we were all betrayd.
202A.15	 &#145;Again I was at curst Dunbar,
	 And was a prisner taen,
	 And many weary night and day
	 In prison I hae lien.&#146;
202A.16	 &#145;If ye will lead these men aright,
	 Rewarded shal ye be;
	 But, if that ye a traitor prove,
	 I&#146;ll hang thee on a tree.&#146;
202A.17	 &#145;Sir, I will not a traitor prove;
	 Montrose has plunderd me;
	 I&#146;ll do my best to banish him
	 Away frae this country.&#146;
202A.18	 He halvd his men in equal parts,
	 His purpose to fulfill;
	 The one part kept the water-side,
	 The other gaed round the hill.
202A.19	 The nether party fired brisk,
	 Then turnd and seemd to rin;
	 And then they a&#146; came frae the trench,
	 And cry&#146;d The day&#146;s our ain!
202A.20	 The rest then ran into the trench,
	 And loosd their cannons a&#146;:
	 And thus, between his armies twa,
	 He made them fast to fa.
202A.21	 Now let us a&#146; for Lesly pray
	 And his brave company,
	 For they hae vanquishd great Montrose,
	 Our cruel enemy.
