<PRE>

130A.1	 THEN bold Robin Hood to the north he would go,
	 With a hey down down a down down
	 With valour and mickle might,
	 With sword by his side, which oft had been tri&#146;d,
	 To fight and recover his right.
130A.2	 The first that he met was a bony bold Scot,
	 His servant he said he would be;
	 &#145;No,&#146; quoth Robin Hood, &#146;it cannot be good,
	 For thou wilt prove false unto me.
130A.3	 &#145;Thou hast not bin true to sire nor cuz:&#146;
	 &#145;Nay, marry,&#146; the Scot he said,
	 &#145;As true as your heart, I&#146;le never part,
	 Gude master, be not afraid.&#146;
	 * * * * *
130A.4	 Then Robin Hood turnd his face to the east;
	 &#145;Fight on my merry men stout,
	 Our cause is good,&#146; quoth brave Robin Hood,
	 &#145;And we shall not be beaten out.&#146;
130A.5	 The battel grows hot on every side,
	 The Scotchman made great moan;
	 Quoth Jockey, Gude faith, they fight on each side;
	 Would I were with my wife Ione!
130A.6	 The enemy compast brave Robin about,
	 &#146;Tis long ere the battel ends;
	 Ther&#146;s neither will yeeld nor give up the field,
	 For both are supplied with friends.
	 * * * * *
130A.7	 This song it was made in Robin Hoods dayes;
	 Let&#146;s pray unto Iove above
	 To give us true peace, that mischief may cease,
	 And war may give place unto love.

130B.1	 NOW bold Robin Hood to the north would go,
	 With valour and mickle might,
	 With sword by his side, which oft had been try&#146;d,
	 To fight and recover his right.
130B.2	 The first that he met was a jolly stout Scot,
	 His servant he said he would be;
	 &#145;No,&#146; quoth Robin Hood, &#146;it cannot be good,
	 For thou wilt prove false unto me.
130B.3	 &#145;Thou hast not been true to sire or cuz;&#146;
	 &#145;Nay, marry,&#146; the Scot he said,
	 &#145;As true as your heart, I never will part;
	 Good master, be not afraid.&#146;
130B.4	 &#145;But eer I employ you,&#146; said bold Robin Hood,
	 &#145;With you I must have a bout;&#146;
	 The Scotchman reply&#146;d, Let the battle be try&#146;d,
	 For I know I will beat you out.
130B.5	 Thus saying, the contest did quickly begin,
	 Which lasted two hours and more;
	 The blows Sawney gave bold Robin so brave
	 The battle soon made him give oer.
130B.6	 &#145;Have mercy, thou Scotchman,&#146; bold Robin Hood cry&#146;d,
	 &#145;Full dearly this boon have I bought;
	 We will both agree, and my man you shall be,
	 For a stouter I never have fought.&#146;
130B.7	 Then Sawny consented with Robin to go,
	 To be of his bowmen so gay;
	 Thus ended the fight, and with mickle delight
	 To Sherwood they hasted away.
