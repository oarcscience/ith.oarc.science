17A.1	IN Scotland there was a babie born,
      Refrain:	Lill lal, etc.
	And his name it was called young Hind Horn.
      Refrain:	With a fal lal, etc.
17A.2	He sent a letter to our king
	That he was in love with his daughter Jean.
17A.3	He&#146;s gien to her a silver wand,
	With seven living lavrocks sitting thereon.
17A.4	She&#146;s gien to him a diamond ring,
	With seven bright diamonds set therein.
17A.5	&#145;When this ring grows pale and wan,
	You may know by it my love is gane.&#146;
17A.6	One day as he looked his ring upon,
	He saw the diamonds pale and wan.
17A.7	He left the sea and came to land,
	And the first that he met was an old beggar man.
17A.8	&#145;What news, what news?&#146; said young Hind Horn;
	&#145;No news, no news,&#146; said the old beggar man.
17A.9	&#145;No news,&#146; said the beggar, &#146;No news at a&#146;,
	But there is a wedding in the king&#146;s ha.
17A.10	&#145;But there is a wedding in the king&#146;s ha,
	That has halden these forty days and twa.&#146;
17A.11	&#145;Will ye lend me your begging coat?
	And I&#146;ll lend you my scarlet cloak.
17A.12	&#145;Will you lend me your beggar&#146;s rung?
	And I&#146;ll gie you my steed to ride upon.
17A.13	&#145;Will you lend me your wig o hair,
	To cover mine, because it is fair?&#146;
17A.14	The auld beggar man was bound for the mill,
	But young Hind Horn for the king&#146;s hall.
17A.15	The auld beggar man was bound for to ride,
	But young Hind Horn was bound for the bride.
17A.16	When he came to the king&#146;s gate,
	He sought a drink for Hind Horn&#146;s sake.
17A.17	The bride came down with a glass of wine,
	When he drank out the glass, and dropt in the ring.
17A.18	&#145;O got ye this by sea or land?
	Or got ye it off a dead man&#146;s hand?&#146;
17A.19	&#145;I got not it by sea, I got it by land,
	And I got it, madam, out of your own hand.&#146;
17A.20	&#145;O I&#146;ll cast off my gowns of brown,
	And beg wi you frae town to town.
17A.21	&#145;O I&#146;ll cast off my gowns of red,
	And I&#146;ll beg wi you to win my bread.&#146;
17A.22	&#145;Ye needna cast off your gowns of brown,
	For I&#146;ll make you lady o many a town.
17A.23	&#145;Ye needna cast off your gowns of red,
	It&#146;s only a sham, the begging o my bread.&#146;
17A.24	The bridegroom he had wedded the bride,
	But young Hind Horn he took her to bed.

17B.2	She gave to me a gay gold ring,
	With three shining diamonds set therein.
17B.3	And I gave to her a silver wand,
	With three singing lavrocks set thereon.
17B.4	&#145;What if these diamonds lose their hue,
	Just when your love begins for to rew?&#146;
17B.5	He&#146;s left the land, and he&#146;s gone to sea,
	And he&#146;s stayd there seven years and a day.
17B.6	But when he looked this ring upon,
	The shining diamonds were both pale and wan.
17B.7	He&#146;s left the seas and he&#146;s come to the land,
	And there he met with an auld beggar man.

	And along with thee I&#146;ll beg my bread.&#146;
17B.22	&#145;Thou need not cast off thy gowns of brown,
	For I can make thee lady of many a town.
17B.23	&#145;Thou need not cast off thy gowns of red,
	For I can maintain thee with both wine and bread.&#146;

	But Young Hyn Horn took the bride to bed.
