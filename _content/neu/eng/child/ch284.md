# 284A: John Dory


    284A.1   As it fell on a holy-day,
         And vpon an holy-tide-a,
         Iohn Dory bought him an ambling nag,
         To Paris for to ride-a.
    284A.2   And when John Dory to Paris was come,
         A little before the gate-a,
         John Dory was fitted, the porter was witted
         To let him in thereat-a.
    284A.3   The first man that John Dory did meet
         Was good king John of France-a;
         John Dory could well of his courtesie,
         But fell downe in a trance-a.
    284A.4   A pardon, a pardon, my liege and my king,
         For my merie men and for me-a,
         And all the churles in merie England,
         Ile bring them all bound to thee-a.
    284A.5   And Nicholl was then a Cornish man,
         A little beside Bohide-a,
         And he mande forth a good blacke barke,
         With fiftie good oares on a side-a.
    284A.6   Run vp, my boy, vnto the maine top,
         And looke what thou canst spie-a:
         Who ho! who ho! a goodly ship I do see,
         I trow it be John Dory[-a]
    284A.7   They hoist their sailes, both top and top,
         The meisseine and all was tride-a,
         And euery man stood to his lot,
         What euer should betide-a.
    284A.8   The roring cannons then were plide,
         And dub-a-dub went the drumme-a;
         The braying trumpets lowde they cride
         To courage both all and some-a.
    284A.9   The grappling-hooks were brought at length,
         The browne bill and the sword-a,
         John Dory at length, for all his strength,
         Was clapt fast vnder board-a.
