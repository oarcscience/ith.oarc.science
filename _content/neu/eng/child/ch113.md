# 113: The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry


    113.1    AN eartly nourris sits and sing,
         And aye she sings, Ba, lily wean!
         Little ken I my bairnis father,
         Far less the land that he staps in.
    113.2    Then ane arose at her bed-fit,
         An a grumly guest Im sure was he:
         Here am I, thy bairnis father,
         Although that I be not comelie.
    113.3    I am a man, upo the lan,
         An I am a silkie in the sea;
         And when Im far and far frae lan,
         My dwelling is in Sule Skerrie.
    113.4    It was na weel, quo the maiden fair,
         It was na weel, indeed, quo she,
         That the Great Silkie of Sule Skerrie
         Suld hae come and aught a bairn to me.
    113.5    Now he has taen a purse of goud,
         And he has pat it upo her knee,
         Sayin, Gie to me my little young son,
         An tak thee up thy nourris-fee.
    113.6    An it sall come to pass on a simmers day,
         When the sin shines het on evera stane,
         That I will tak my little young son,
         An teach him for to swim the faem.
    113.7    An thu sall marry a proud gunner,
         An a proud gunner Im sure hell be,
         An the very first schot that ere he schoots,
         Hell schoot baith my young son and me.
