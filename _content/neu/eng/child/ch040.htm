<PRE>

40.1	I HEARD a cow low, a bonnie cow low,
	An a cow low down in yon glen;
	Lang, lang will my young son greet
	Or his mither bid him come ben.
40.2	I heard a cow low, a bonnie cow low,
	An a cow low down in yon fauld;
	Lang, lang will my young son greet
	Or his mither take him frae cauld.
	* * * * *
40.3	. . . . .
	. . . .
	Waken, Queen of Elfan,
	An hear your nourice moan.&#146;
40.4	&#145;O moan ye for your meat,
	Or moan ye for your fee,
	Or moan ye for the ither bounties
	That ladies are wont to gie?&#146;
40.5	&#145;I moan na for my meat,
	Nor moan I for my fee,
	Nor moan I for the ither bounties
	That ladies are wont to gie.
40.6	. . . . .
	. . . . .
	But I moan for my young son
	I left in four nights auld.
40.7	&#145;I moan na for my meat,
	Nor yet for my fee,
	But I mourn for Christen land,
	It&#146;s there I fain would be.&#146;
40.8	&#145;O nurse my bairn, nourice,&#146; she says,
	&#145;Till he stan at your knee,
	An ye&#146;s win hame to Christen land,
	Whar fain it&#146;s ye wad be.
40.9	&#145;O keep my bairn, nourice,
	Till he gang by the hauld,
	An ye&#146;s win hame to your young son
	Ye left in four nights auld.&#146;
	* * * * *
40.10	&#145;O nourice lay your head
	Upo my knee:
	See ye na that narrow road
	Up by yon tree?
40.11	. . . . . .
	. . . . .
	That&#146;s the road the righteous goes,
	And that&#146;s the road to heaven.
40.12	&#145;An see na ye that braid road,
	Down by yon sunny fell?
	Yon&#146;s the road the wicked gae,
	An that&#146;s the road to hell.&#146;
