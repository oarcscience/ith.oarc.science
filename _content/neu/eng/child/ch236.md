# 236A: The Laird o Drum


    236A.1   O IT fell out upon a day,
         When Drums was going to ride, O
         And there he met with a well-fard may,
         Keeping her flocks on yon side. O
    236A.2   O fair may, O rare may,
         Can not you fancy me?
         Of a the lasses here about
         I like nane so well as thee.
    236A.3   Set your love on another, kind sir,
         Set it not on me,
         For Im not fit to be your bride,
         And your whore Ill never be.
    236A.4   Drums is to her father gane,
         Keeping his flocks on yon hill,
         And he has gotten his consent,
         And the maid was at his will.
    236A.5   My daughter can neither read nor write,
         She was neer brought up at school;
         But well can she milk cow and ewe,
         And make a kebbuck well.
    236A.6   Shell winn in your barn at bear-seed time,
         Cast out your muck at Yule;
         Shell saddle your steed in time o need,
         Draw aff your boots hersell.
    236A.7   Have not I no clergymen?
         Pay I no clergy fee?
         Ill school her as I think fit,
         And as I think fit to be.
    236A.8   Drums is to the Highlands gane
         For to be made ready,
         And a the gentry thereabout
         Says, Yonder comes Drums and his lady.
    236A.9   Peggy Coutts is a very bonnie bride,
         And Drums is a wealthy laddie;
         But Drums might hae chosen a higher match
         Than any shepherds daughter.
    236A.10  Then up bespake his brother John,
         Says, Brother youve done us wrong;
         Youve married ane below our degree,
         A stain to a our kin.
    236A.11  Hold your tongue, my brother John,
         I have done you no wrong;
         For Ive married ane to wirk and win,
         And yeve married ane to spend.
    236A.12  The last time that I had a wife,
         She was above my degree;
         I durst not come in her presence
         But with my hat on my knee.
    236A.13  There was four-and-twenty gentlemen
         Stood at the yetts o Drum;
         There was na ane amang them a
         That welcomd his lady in.
    236A.14  Hes taen her by the milk-white hand
         And led her in himsell,
         And in thro has and thro bowers,
         And youre welcome, Lady o Drum.
    236A.15  Thrice he kissd her cherry cheek,
         And thrice her cherry chin,
         And twenty times her comely mouth,
         And youre welcome, Lady o Drum.
    236A.16  Ye shall be cook in my kitchen,
         Butler in my ha;
         Ye shall be lady at my command
         When I ride far awa.
    236A.17  But what will I do when auld Drum dies,
         When auld Drum dies and leaves me?
         Then Ill tak back my word again,
         And the Coutts will come and see me.
         * * * * *

    236B.6   . . . .

         Ye can neither gan[g] nor ride,

    236D.15  Out then spake the Laird of Drum,
         Says, Ive dune you nae wrang;
         Ive married a wife to win my bread,
         Youve married ane to spend.
    236D.16  For the last time that I was married,

         As ye are o low degree,
         We might hae baith gane down the streets
         Amang gude companie.
    236D.19  I tauld you ere we were wed
         You were far abeen my degree;
         But now Im married, in your bed laid,
         And just as gude as ye.
    236D.20  Gin ye were dead, and I were dead,
         And baith in grave had lain,
         Ere seven years were at an end,
         Theyd not ken your dust frae mine.

         For I learnt the girly mysell;
         Shell fill in your barn, and winnow your corn,
         Shell gang to your kill and your mill,
         And, time o need, shell saddle your steed,
         And draw your boots hersell.

         Was far above my command;
         I durst not enter the bower where she was
         But my hat low in my hand.

         And you must be content wi me.
    236E.18  For an ye were dead, an I were dead,
         And laid in the dust low down,
         When we were baith turnd up again
         Wha could ken your mould frae mine?

    236F.10  Oh, brother, Ive married a wife to win,
         And yeve got one to spen,
         And as long as the bonnie lassie walks out and in
         She shall aye be the ladye o the Drum.
    236F.11  When all was done, and no bells rung,
         And all men bound for their bed,
         The laird and the shepherds bonnie daughter
         In one bed they were laid.
    236F.12  Though Im not of as noble blood,
         Nor yet of as high degree,
         Now I lie locked in your arms two,
         And you must be contented wi me.
    236F.13  If you were dead, and I were dead,
         And baith laid in one grave,
         If we were baith to be raised up again,
         Wha would ken your dust frae mine?
