<PRE>

303A.1	 FAIR ANNIE had a costly bower,
	 Well built wi lime and stane,
	 And Willie came to visit her,
	 Wit the light o the meen.
303A.2	 When he came to Annie&#146;s bower-door,
	 He tirled at the pin:
	 &#145;Ye sleep ye, wake ye, Fair Annie,
	 Ye&#146;ll open, lat me come in.&#146;
303A.3	 &#145;O never a fit,&#146; says Fair Annie,
	 &#145;Till I your errand ken;&#146;
	 &#145;My father&#146;s vowed a vow, Annie,
	 I&#146;ll tell you when I&#146;m in.
303A.4	 &#145;My father&#146;s vowed a rash vow,
	 I darena marry thee;
	 My mither&#146;s vowed anither vow,
	 My bride ye&#146;se never be.&#146;
303A.5	 &#145;If ye had tauld me that, Willie,
	 When we began to woo,
	 There was naithing in this warld wide
	 Shoud drawn my love to you.
303A.6	 &#145;A nun, a nun,&#146; said Fair Annie,
	 &#145;A nun will I be then;&#146;
	 &#145;A priest, a priest,&#146; said Sweet Willie,
	 &#145;A priest will I be syne.&#146;
303A.7	 She is gane to her father,
	 For mither she had nane;
	 And she is on to her father,
	 To see if she&#146;d be a nun.
303A.8	 &#145;An asking, asking, father dear,
	 An asking ye&#146;ll grant me;
	 That&#146;s to get to the holy nunnery,
	 And there to live or die.&#146;
303A.9	 &#145;Your asking&#146;s nae sae great, daughter,
	 But granted it shall be;
	 For ye&#146;se won to the holy nunnery,
	 There to live or die.&#146;
303A.10	 Then they gaed on, and farther on,
	 Till they came to the yate;
	 And there they spied a maiden porter,
	 Wi gowd upon her hat.
303A.11	 &#145;An asking, asking, maiden porter,
	 An asking ye&#146;ll grant me;
	 If I&#146;ll won to the holy nunnery,
	 There to live or die.&#146;
303A.12	 &#145;Your asking&#146;s nae sae great, lady,
	 But granted it shall be;
	 For ye&#146;se won to the holy nunnery,
	 There to live or die.
303A.13	 &#145;But ye maun vow a vow, lady,
	 Before that ye seek in;
	 Never to kiss a young man&#146;s mouth
	 That goes upon the grun.
303A.14	 &#145;And ye must vow anither vow,
	 Severely ye must work;
	 The well-warst vow that ye&#146;re to vow,
	 Is never to gang to kirk.&#146;
303A.15	 &#145;I will vow a vow,&#146; she said,
	 &#145;Before that I seek in;
	 I neer shall kiss a young man&#146;s mouth
	 That goes upon the grun.
303A.16	 &#145;And I will vow anither vow,
	 Severly I will work;
	 The well-warst vow that I&#146;m to vow
	 Is never to gang to kirk.&#146;
303A.17	 For seven years now Fair Annie,
	 In the holy nunnery lay she,
	 And seven years Sweet Willie lay,
	 In languish like to die.
303A.18	 &#145;Is there nae duke no lord&#146;s daughter,
	 My son, can comfort thee,
	 And save thee frae the gates o death?
	 Is there nae remedie?&#146;
303A.19	 &#145;There is nae duke nor lord&#146;s daughter,
	 Mother, can cofort me,
	 Except it be my love, Annie,
	 In the holy nunnery lies she.&#146;
303A.20	 They&#146;ve dressd Sweet Willie up in silk,
	 Wi gowd his gown did shine,
	 And nane coud ken by his pale face
	 But he was a lady fine.
303A.21	 So they gaed on, and farther on,
	 Till they came to the yate,
	 And there they spied a maiden porter,
	 Wi gowd upon her hat.
303A.22	 &#145;An asking, an asking, maiden porter,
	 An asking ye&#146;ll grant me;
	 For to win in to the holy nunnery,
	 Fair Annie for to see.&#146;
303A.23	 &#145;Your asking&#146;s nae sae great, lady,
	 But granted it shall be;
	 Ye&#146;se won into the holy nunnery,
	 Fair Annie for to see.
303A.24	 &#145;Be she duke&#146;s or lord&#146;s daughter,
	 It&#146;s lang sin she came here:&#146;
	 Fair Annie kent her true love&#146;s face;
	 Says, Come up, my sister dear.
303A.25	 Sweet Willie went to kiss her lips,
	 As he had wont to do;
	 But she softly whispered him,
	 I darena this avow.
