<PRE>

205A.1	 YOURR&#146;rrL marvel when I tell ye o
	 Our noble Burly and his train,
	 When last he marchd up through the land,
	 Wi sax-and-twenty westland men.
205A.2	 Than they I neer o braver heard,
	 For they had a&#146; baith wit and skill;
	 They proved right well, as I heard tell,
	 As they cam up oer Loudoun Hill.
205A.3	 Weel prosper a&#146; the gospel-lads
	 That are into the west countrie
	 Ay wicked Claverse to demean,
	 And ay an ill dead may he die!
205A.4	 For he&#146;s drawn up i battle rank,
	 An that baith soon an hastilie;
	 But they wha live till simmer come,
	 Some bludie days for this will see.
205A.5	 But up spak cruel Claverse then,
	 Wi hastie wit an wicked skill,
	 &#145;Gae fire on yon westlan men;
	 I think it is my sovreign&#146;s will.&#146;
205A.6	 But up bespake his cornet then,
	 &#145;It&#146;s be wi nae consent o me;
	 I ken I&#146;ll neer come back again,
	 An mony mae as weel as me.
205A.7	 &#145;There is not ane of a&#146; yon men
	 But wha is worthy other three;
	 There is na ane amang them a&#146;
	 That in his cause will stap to die.
205A.8	 &#145;An as for Burly, him I knaw;
	 He&#146;s a man of honour, birth, an fame;
	 Gie him a sword into his hand,
	 He&#146;ll fight thysel an other ten.&#146;
205A.9	 But up spake wicked Claverse then-+--+-
	 I wat his heart it raise fu hie-+--+-
	 And he has cry&#146;d, that a&#146; might hear,
	 &#145;Man, ye hae sair deceived me.
205A.10	 &#145;I never kend the like afore,
	 Na, never since I came frae hame,
	 That you sae cowardly here suld prove,
	 An yet come of a noble Gra+eme.&#146;
205A.11	 But up bespake his cornet then,
	 &#145;Since that it is your honour&#146;s will,
	 Mysel shall be the foremost man
	 That shall gie fire on Loudoun Hill.
205A.12	 &#145;Your command I&#146;ll lead them on,
	 But yet wi nae consent o me;
	 For weel I ken I&#146;ll neer return,
	 And mony mae as weel as me.&#146;
205A.13	 Then up he drew in battle rank-+--+-
	 I wat he had a bonny train-+--+-
	 But the first time that bullets flew
	 Ay he lost twenty o his men.
205A.14	 Then back he came the way he gaed,
	 I wat right soon an suddenly;
	 He gave command amang his men,
	 And sent them back, and bade them flee.
205A.15	 Then up came Burly, bauld an stout,
	 Wi &#146;s little train o westland men,
	 Wha mair than either aince or twice
	 In Edinburgh confind had been.
205A.16	 They hae been up to London sent,
	 An yet they&#146;re a&#146; come safely down;
	 Sax troop o horsemen they hae beat,
	 And chased them into Glasgow town.
