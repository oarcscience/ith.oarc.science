<p>My mother bore me in the southern wild,<br> And I am black, but O! my soul is white,<br> White as an angel is the English child:<br> But I am black as if bereav&#8217;d of light.</p>  
<p>My mother taught me underneath a tree<br> And sitting down before the heat of day,<br> She took me on her lap and kissed me,<br> And pointing to the east began to say.</p>  
<p>Look on the rising sun: there God does live<br> And gives his light, and gives his heat away.<br> And flowers and trees and beasts and men recieve<br> Comfort in morning joy in the noon day.</p>  
<p>And we are put on earth a little space,<br> That we may learn to bear the beams of love.<br> And these black bodies and this sun-burnt face<br> Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.</p>

<p>For when our souls have learn&#8217;d the heat to bear<br> The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice,<br> Saying: come out from the grove my love &amp; care,<br> And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.</p>  
<p>Thus did my mother say and kissed me.<br> And thus I say to little English boy.<br> When I from black and he from white cloud free,<br> And round the tent of God like lambs we joy:</p>  
<p>Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear,<br> To lean in joy upon our fathers knee.<br> And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,<br> And be like him and he will then love me.</p>
