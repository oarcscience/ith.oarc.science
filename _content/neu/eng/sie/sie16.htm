<p>The sun descending in the west,<br> The evening star does shine,<br> The birds are silent in their nest,<br> And I must seek for mine,<br> The moon like a flower,<br> In heavens high bower;<br> With silent delight,<br> Sits and smiles on the night.</p>  
<p>Farewell green fields and happy groves,<br> Where flocks have took delight;<br> Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves<br> The feet of angels bright;<br> Unseen they pour blessing,<br> And joy without ceasing,<br> On each bud and blossom,<br> And each sleeping bosom.</p>  
<p>They look in every thoughtless nest,<br> Where birds are coverd warm;<br> They visit caves of every beast,<br> To keep them all from harm:<br> If they see any weeping,<br> That should have been sleeping<br> They pour sleep on their head<br> And sit down by their bed.</p>

<p>When wolves and tygers howl for prey<br> They pitying stand and weep;<br> Seeking to drive their thirst away,<br> And keep them from the sheep,<br> But if they rush dreadful;<br> The angels most heedful,<br> Recieve each mild spirit,<br> New worlds to inherit.</p>  
<p>And there the lions ruddy eyes,<br> Shall flow with tears of gold:<br> And pitying the tender cries,<br> And walking round the fold:<br> Saying: wrath by his meekness<br> And by his health, sickness,<br> Is driven away,<br> From our immortal day.</p>  
<p>And now beside thee bleating lamb,<br> I can lie down and sleep;<br> Or think on him who bore thy name,<br> Grase after thee and weep.<br> For wash&#8217;d in lifes river,<br> My bright mane for ever,<br> Shall shine like the gold,</p>
