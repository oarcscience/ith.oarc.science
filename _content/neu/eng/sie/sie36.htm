<p>I went to the Garden of Love.<br> And saw what I never had seen:<br> A Chapel was built in the midst,<br> Where I used to play on the green.</p>  
<p>And the gates of this Chapel were shut,<br> And Thou shalt not, writ over the door;<br> So I turn&#8217;d to the Garden of Love,<br> That so many sweet flowers bore,</p>  
<p>And I saw it was filled with graves,<br> And tomb-stones where flowers should be:<br> And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,<br> And binding with briars, my joys &amp; desires.</p>
