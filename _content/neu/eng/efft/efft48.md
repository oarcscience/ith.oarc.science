# THE HEDLEY KOW.  <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55)

THE Hedley Kow was a bogie, mischievous rather than malignant, which
haunted the village of Hedley, near Ebchester. His appearance was never
very alarming, and he used to end his frolics with a horse-laugh at the
expense of his victims. He would present himself to some old dame
gathering sticks, in the form of a truss of straw, which she would be
sure to take up and carry away. Then it would become so heavy she would
have to lay her burden down, on which the straw would become "quick,"
rise upright, and shuffle away before he; till at last it vanished from
her sight with a laugh and shout. Again, in the shape of a favourite
cow, the sprite would lead the milkmaid a long chase round the field,
and after kicking and routing during milking-time would upset the pail,
slip clear of the tie, and vanish with a loud laugh. Indeed the "Kow"
must have been a great nuisance in a farmhouse, for it is said to have
constantly imitated the voice of the servant-girl's lovers, overturned
the kail-pot, given the cream to the cats, unravelled the knitting, or
put the spinning-wheel out of order But the sprite made himself most
obnoxious at the birth of a child. He would torment the man who rod for
the howdie, frightening the horse, and often making him upset both
messenger and howdie, and leave them in t road. Then he would mock the
gudewife, and, when her angry husband rushed out with a stick to drive
away the "Kow" from the door or window, the stick would be snatched from
him, and lustily applied to his own shoulders.

Two adventures with the Hedley Kow are thus related. A farmer named
Forster, who lived near Hedley, went out into the field one morning, and
caught, as he believed, his own grey horse. After putting the harness
on, and yoking him to the cart, Forster was about to drive off, when the
creature slipped away from the limmers "like a knotless thread," and set
up a great nicker as he flung up his heels and scoured away, revealing
himself clearly as the Hedley Kow. Again, two young men of Newlands,
near Ebchester, went out one evening to meet their sweethearts; and
arriving at the trysting-place, saw them, as it appeared, a short
distance before them. The girls walked on for two or three miles; the
lads followed, quite unable to overtake them, till at last they found
themselves up to the knees in a bog, and their beguilers vanished, with
a loud Ha! ha! The young men got clear of the mire and ran homewards, as
fast as they could, the bogie at their heels hooting and mocking them.
In crossing the Derwent they fell into the water, mistook each other for
the sprite, and finally reached home separately, each telling a fearful
tale of having been chased by the Hedley Kow, and nearly drowned in the
Derwent.

Surely this Northern sprite is closely akin to Robin Good-fellow, whom
Ben Jonson introduced to us as speaking thus:

"Sometimes I meete them like a man,  
Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound,  
And to a horse I turn me can,  
To trip and trot about them round.  
But if to ride My backe they stride,  
More swift than wind away I go:  
O'er the hedge and lands,  
Through pools and ponds,  
I whirry laughing, Ho ho ho!"
