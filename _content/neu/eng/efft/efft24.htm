<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">EDWIN AND SIR TOPAZ. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></H1>
<P>IN Britain's isle and Arthur's days, <BR>
When midnight faeries daunc'd the maze.<BR>
Liv'd Edwin of the green;<BR>
Edwin, I wis, a gentle youth, <BR>
Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth,<BR>
Though badly shap'd he been.</P>
<P>His mountain back mote well be said <BR>
To measure heighth against his head,<BR>
And lift itself above:<BR>
Yet spite of all that Nature did To make his uncouth form forbid, <BR>
This creature dar'd to love.</P>
<P>He felt the charms of Edith's eyes, <BR>
Nor wanted hope to gain the prize, <BR>
Could ladies look within;<BR>
But one Sir Topaz dress'd with art, <BR>
And, if a shape could win a heart, <BR>
He had a shape to win.</P>
<P>Edwin, if right I read my song, <BR>
With slighted passion pac'd along <BR>
All in the moony light:<BR>
'Twas near an old enchanted court, <BR>
Where sportive faeries made resort <BR>
To revel out the night.</P>
<P>His heart was drear, his hope was crossd, <BR>
'Twas late, 'twas farr, the path was lost <BR>
That reach'd the neighbour-town;<BR>
With weary steps he quits the shades, <BR>
Resolv'd the darkling dome he treads, <BR>
And drops his limbs adown.</P>
<P>But scant he lays him on the floor, <BR>
When hollow winds remove the door, <BR>
A trembling rocks the ground:<BR>
And, well I ween to count aright, <BR>
At once an hundred tapers light <BR>
On all the walls around.</P>
<P>Now sounding tongues assail his ear, <BR>
Now sounding feet approachen near, <BR>
And now the sounds encrease;<BR>
And from the corner where he lay <BR>
He sees a train profusely gay <BR>
Come pranckling o'er the place.</P>
<P>But, trust me, gentles, never yet <BR>
Was dight a masquing half so neat, <BR>
Or half so rich before;<BR>
The country lent the sweet perfumes, <BR>
The sea the pearl, the sky the plumes, <BR>
The town its silken store.</P>
<P>Now whilst he gazed, a gallant drest <BR>
In flaunting robes above the rest, <BR>
With awfull accent cried:<BR>
"What mortal of a wretched mind, <BR>
Whose sighs infect the balmy wind, <BR>
Has here presumed to hide?"</P>
<P>At this the swain, whose venturous soul <BR>
No fears of magic art controul, <BR>
Advanc'd in open sight.<BR>
"Nor have I cause of dreed," he said, <BR>
"Who view, by no presumption led, <BR>
Your revels of the night.</P>
<P>"'Twas grief for scorn of faithful love, <BR>
Which made ray steps unweeting rove <BR>
Amid the nightly dew."<BR>
"'Tis well," the gallant cries again, <BR>
"We faeries never injure men <BR>
Who dare to tell us true.</P>
<P>"Exalt thy love-dejected heart, <BR>
Be mine the task, or ere we part, <BR>
To make thee grief resign;<BR>
Now take the pleasure of thy chaunce; <BR>
Whilst I with Mab, my partner, daunce, <BR>
Be little Mable thine!"</P>
<P>He spoke, and all a sudden there <BR>
Light musick floats in wanton air; <BR>
The monarch leads the queen;<BR>
The rest their faerie partners found, <BR>
And Mable trimly tript the ground <BR>
With Edwin of the green.</P>
<P>The dauncing past, the board was laid, <BR>
And siker such a feast was made<BR>
As heart and lip desire;<BR>
Withouten hands the dishes fly, <BR>
The glasses with a wish come nigh,<BR>
And with a wish retire</P>
<P>But now to please the faery king, <BR>
Full every deal they laugh and sing, <BR>
And antick feats devise;<BR>
Some wind and tumble like an ape, <BR>
And other-some transmute their shape <BR>
In Edwin's wondering eyes.</P>
<P>Till one at last that Robin hight, <BR>
Renown'd for pinching maids by night, <BR>
Has hent him up aloof;<BR>
And full against the beam he flung, <BR>
Where by the back the youth he hung <BR>
To sprawl unneath the roof.</P>
<P>From thence, "Reverse my charm," he cries <BR>
"And let it fairly now suffice<BR>
The gambol has been shown." <BR>
But Oberon answers with a smile, <BR>
"Content thee, Edwin, for a while,<BR>
The vantage is thine own."</P>
<P>Here ended all the phantome play; <BR>
They smelt the fresh approach of day, <BR>
And heard a cock to crow;<BR>
The whirling wind that bore the crowd <BR>
Has clapp'd the door, and whistled loud <BR>
To warn them all to go.</P>
<P>Then screaming all at once they fly, <BR>
And all at once the tapers die; <BR>
Poor Edwin falls to floor;<BR>
Forlorn his state, and dark the place, <BR>
Was never wight in such a case <BR>
Through all the land before.</P>
<P>But soon as Dan Apollo rose, <BR>
Full jolly creature home he goes, <BR>
He feels his back the less;<BR>
His honest tongue and steady mind <BR>
Han rid him of the lump behind <BR>
Which made him want success.</P>
<P>With lusty livelyhed he talks, <BR>
He seems adauncing as he walks; <BR>
His story soon took wind;<BR>
And beauteous Edith sees the youth, <BR>
Endow'd with courage, sense, and truth, <BR>
Without a bunch behind.</P>
<P>The story told, Sir Topaz mov'd, <BR>
The youth of Edith erst approv'd, <BR>
To see the revel scene.<BR>
At close of eve he leaves his home, <BR>
And wends to find the ruin'd dome <BR>
All on the gloomy plain.</P>
<P>As there he bides, it so befell, <BR>
The wind came rustling down a dell, <BR>
A shaking seiz'd the wall:<BR>
Up sprang the tapers as before, <BR>
The faeries bragly foot the floor, <BR>
And musick fills the hall.</P>
<P>But, certes, sorely sunk with woe, <BR>
Sir Topaz sees the elfin show,<BR>
His spirits in him die:<BR>
When Oberon cries, "A man is near <BR>
A mortall passion, cleeped fear,<BR>
Hangs flagging in the sky."</P>
<P>With that Sir Topaz, hapless youth, <BR>
In accents faultering ay for ruth <BR>
Intreats them pity graunt;<BR>
For als he been a mister wight <BR>
Betray'd by wandering in the night <BR>
To tread the circled haunt.</P>
<P>"Ah losell vile!" at once they roar, <BR>
"And little skill'd of faerie lore, <BR>
Thy cause to come we know:<BR>
Now has thy kestrell courage fell; <BR>
And faeries, since a lie you tell, <BR>
Are free to work thee woe."</P>
<P>Then Will, who bears the wispy fire <BR>
To trail the swains among the mire, <BR>
The caitive upward flung;<BR>
There like a tortoise in a shop <BR>
He dangled from the chamber-top <BR>
Where whilome Edwin hung.</P>
<P>The revel now proceeds apace, <BR>
Deffly they frisk it o'er the place, <BR>
They sit, they drink, and eat;<BR>
The time with frolick mirth beguile, <BR>
And poor Sir Topaz hangs the while <BR>
Till all the rout retreat.</P>
<P>By this the starrs began to wink, <BR>
They shriek, they fly, the tapers sink, <BR>
And down ydrops the knight:<BR>
For never spell by faerie laid <BR>
With strong enchantment bound a glade <BR>
Beyond the length of night.</P>
<P>Chill, dark, alone, adreed, he lay, <BR>
Till up the welkin rose the day, <BR>
Then deem'd the dole was o'er:<BR>
But wot ye well his harder lot? <BR>
His seely back the bunch has got <BR>
Which Edwin lost afore.</P>
<P>This tale a Sybil-nurse ared; <BR>
She softly stroked my youngling head,<BR>
And when the tale was done,<BR>
"Thus some are born, my son," she cried<BR>
"With base impediment to rise,<BR>
And some are born with none.</P>
<P>"But virtue can itself advance <BR>
To what the favourite fools of chance<BR>
By fortune seem'd design'd; <BR>
Virtue can gain the odds of fate, <BR>
And from itself shake off the weight<BR>
Upon th' unworthy mind."</P>
