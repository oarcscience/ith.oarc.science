# EARLY BRITISH TRACKWAYS.

## MOATS. MOUNDS, CAMPS AND SITES.

### INTRODUCTION.

I have read of a lad who, idly probing a hill-side rabbit hole, saw a
gleam of gold, then more, and in short had found a royal treasury. And
he could not show all to those interested, but only samples, and he made
mistakes in describing the dates and workmanship of the coins, vessels
and jewels. But the treasure was there all the same.

I knew nothing on June 30th last of what I now communicate, and had no
theories. A visit to Blackwardine led me to note on the map a straight
line starting from Croft Ambury, lying on parts of Croft Lane past the
Broad, over hill points, through Blackwardine, over Risbury Camp, and
through the high ground at Stretton Grandison, where I surmise a Roman
station. I followed up the clue of sighting from hill top, unhampered by
other theories, found it yielding astounding results in all districts,
the straight lines to my amazement passing over and over again through
the same class of objects, which I soon found to be (or to have been)
practical sighting points.

For the sake of clearness I will give an outline of the whole method
before furnishing proofs and examples.

It is necessary first to clear the mind of present ideas of roads from
town to town, or with enclosed hedges, also of any assumption that
orderly road planning was introduced by the Romans, and that my paper is
to explain the Roman roads.

Presume a primitive people, with few or no enclosures, wanting a few
necessities (as salt, flint flakes, and, later on, metals) only to be
had from a distance. The shortest way to such a distant point was a
straight line, the human way of attaining a straight line is by
sighting, and accordingly all these early trackways were straight, and
laid out in much the same way that a marksman gets the back and fore
sights of his rifle in line with the target.

During a long period, the limits of which remain to be discovered, but
apparently from the Neolithic (later flint) age on past the Roman
occupation into a period of decay, all trackways were in straight lines
marked out by experts on a sighting system.

Such sighting lines were (in earlier examples) from natural mountain
peak to mountain peak, usually not less than 1,000 ft., in this
district, probably lower heights in flat districts, such points being
terminals.

Such a sighting line (or ley) would be useless unless some further
marking points on the lower ground between were made. Therefore
secondary sighting points were made, easily to be seen by the ordinary
user standing at the preceding sighting point, all being planned on one
straight line. These secondary, and artificial, sighting points still
remain in many cases, either as originally made, or modified to other
uses, and a large number are marked on maps, and are the basis of my
discovery.

They were constructed either of earth, water or stone, trees being also
planted on the line. Sacred wells were sometimes terminals in the line,
and sometimes included as secondary points.

Between the sighting points the trackway ran straight, except in cases
of physical impossibility, but did not of necessity go as far as the
primary hill tops.

Earth sighting points were chiefly on higher ground, and now bear the
name of tump, tumulus, mound, twt, castle, bury, cairn, garn, tomen,
low, barrow, knoll, knap, moat and camp. Another form of earth sighting
point was in the form of a notch or cutting in a bank or mountain ridge
which had to be crossed by the sighting line.

Water sighting points seem to have evolved from the excavations made for
the tumps or moats. Almost all are on low ground, to form a point or
ring of reflection from higher ground, and are now known as moats and
ponds.

Stone sighting or marking points were natural (not dressed) blocks.

Sighting lines were (in earliest examples) up to 50 or 60 miles in
length, later on rather shorter, down to a few miles.

Sighting points were used for commerce and for assemblies of the people.

When troublesome times came and stronger defences wanted, the groups of
two or three sighting tumps which came near together (especially on the
top of a hill) often had defensive earthworks added to make a fortified
enclosed camp.

These trackways of successive ages grew so thick on the ground as to vie
in number with present day roads and by-ways.

All forms of sighting points became objects of interest, superstition,
and genuine veneration, and as such were utilized on the introduction of
Christianity.

Practically all ancient churches are on the site of these sighting
points (tumps or stones), usually at a cross of tracks, and there is
evidence that in some cases the churchyard cross is on the exact spot of
the ancient sighting or marking stone.

In time, homesteads clustered round the sighting points, especially the
ponds.

The moats and tumps were often adopted in after ages as sites for the
defensive houses or castles of wealthy owners.

Hundreds of place names give support to these propositions.
