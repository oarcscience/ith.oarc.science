### DISCOVERY BY PLACE NAME.

I have experienced this in several cases, and will detail one. A local
antiquarian (Mr. W. Pitley) always maintained that there had been an
ancient spring--the Bewell spring--close to Bewell House and the
Hereford Brewery within the City. When I lived there with my father we
knew nothing of it. But about a year ago the present owners in sinking a
new deep well and building a new engine house, uncovered the following
inscription cut in stone in the base of the brewery wall, but covered by
a rockery in my time:--

Well, 71 FEET, 1724.

I had always felt that the derivation given for the place name Bewell
Street as Behind-the-wall Street was an error.

There is a hill on the Canon Pyon road called Bewley or Bewdley Pitch.
Solely on account of my surmise that the Bew-ley might lead to the
Bew-well, I tried a line on the map and found a ley exactly falling on
this "pitch" (or steep road) passing from the north through Bishops Moat
(west of Bishops Castle), Meer Oak, Bucknell Church, Street Court,
Stretford Churchyard, and Birley Churchyard, and exactly over the site
of the well. Southwards over Palace Ford, Dinedor Camp, Caradock, Picts
Cross, Hom Green Cross, Walford Church, Leys Hill, Speech House; there
being numerous confirmations in fragments of road.
