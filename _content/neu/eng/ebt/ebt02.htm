<P><A HREF="ebt04.htm#img_pl01">PLATE I. PRIMARY PEAK</A>. Titterstone Clee Hill, and Park Hall, Bitterley.</P>
<P><A HREF="ebt04.htm#img_pl02">PLATE II. MOUNDS</A>. 1, Tre-fedw, Pandy. The Skirrid, a primary peak, in distance. 2, Didley. With homestead alongside.</P>
<P><A HREF="ebt05.htm#img_pl03">PLATE III. MOUND AND MOAT</A>. 1, Houghton Mound. 2, Lemore Moat. Note how slight is the dividing line between this type of mound and a moat.</P>
<P><A HREF="ebt05.htm#img_pl04">PLATE IV. THREE-POINT PROOFS</A>. 1 (a telephotograph), Hereford Cathedral and Pen-y-Beacon. Here the camera stood on a known ley in gateway near top of Hafod Hill, and the line runs through pond at foot (marked by sheet of paper), tower of Cathedral, and the 20 mile distant mountain point or bluff. Another ley is seen crossing the meadow in a straight line just where "the lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea." 2, Tre-fedw Mound (see Plate II.), shown at top of sighting line down present road to ancient Monnow ford (alongside present bridge) at Llanvihangel Mill.</P>
<P><A HREF="ebt10.htm#img_pl05">PLATE V. SIGHTING CUTTINGS</A> (all telephotographs). 1, Notch with earthwork at Trewyn Camp above Pandy (Black Mountains). 2, Cutting through top of ridge at Marstow, a bridge now spans it, and the sighting line down to a ford on the Garron is indicated. The road beyond the cutting is on the ley. 3, Black Darren, Longtown (Black Mountains). This is taken from the Tan House, Longtown, and only 100 yards to right or left the notch begins to lessen and then disappear.</P>
<P><A HREF="ebt10.htm#img_pl06">PLATE VI. CAUSEWAYS</A>. 1, Through pond near Ten Houses (now Priory Terrace), Holmer. Note the unmistakable direction, confirmed on map. 2, Through the River Monnow, behind Tan House, Longtown. A piece of fine engineering, the below-stream edge of large stones embedded in grouting or concrete. This ley is over the notch in Plate V.</P>

This is sighted for Balmawr on the ridge, and shows that where possible even mountain side tracks were kept straight. Taken in evening light and shows (on left) the triple tracks down which it is surmised the tile stones for roofing the Abbey to have been slid from the quarry on the top. 2, Stones at base of ancient Wye-side causeway at Bartonsham (formerly Bassam) Farm, Hereford City. The stones continue in a "wash-out" in bed of river to right, and the ley is sighted over tumps at Hoggs Mount and Holmer Lane. Note on bank to right the mark-stone for the ford (see Plate IX.).</P>
