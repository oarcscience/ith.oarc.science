<P>There lived a Puddock in a well,<BR>
And a merry Mousie in a mill.</P>
<P>Puddock he would a-wooing ride<BR>
Sword and pistol by his side.</P>
<P>Puddock came to the Mousie's inn,<BR>
'Mistress Mousie, are you within?'</P>
<P>MOUSIE<BR>
'Yes, kind sir, I am within,<BR>
Softly<I> </I>do I sit and spin.'</P>
<P>PUDDOCK<BR>
'Madam, I am come to woo,<BR>
Marriage I must have of you.'</P>
<P>MOUSIE<BR>
'Marriage I will grant you none<BR>
Till Uncle Ratton he comes home.'</P>
<P>PUDDOCK<BR>
'See, Uncle Ratton's now come in<BR>
Then go and bask the bride within.'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Who is it that sits next the wall<BR>
But Lady Mousie both slim and small?</P>
<P>Who is it that sits next the bride<BR>
But Lord Puddock with yellow side?</P>
<P>But soon came Duckie and with her Sir Drake;<BR>
Duckie takes Puddock and makes him speak.</P>
<P>Then came in the old carl cat<BR>
With a fiddle on his back:<BR>
'Do ye any music lack?'</P>
<P>Puddock he swam down the brook,<BR>
Sir Drake he catched him in his fluke.</P>
<P>The cat he pulled Lord Ratton down,<BR>
The kittens they did claw his crown.</P>
<P>But Lady Mousie, so slim and small,<BR>
Crept into a hole beneath the wall;<BR>
'Squeak,' quoth she, 'I'm out of it all.'</P>
