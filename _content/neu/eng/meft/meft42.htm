<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Stupid's Cries</H1>
<P>THERE was once a little boy, and his mother sent him to buy a sheep's head and pluck; afraid he should forget it, the lad kept saying all the way along:</P><DIR>

<P>'Sheep's head and pluck!<BR>
Sheep's head and pluck!'</P></DIR>

<P>Trudging alone, he came to a stile; but in getting over he fell and hurt himself, and beginning to blubber, forgot what he was sent for. So he stood a little while to consider; at last he thought he recollected it, and began to repeat:</P><DIR>

<P>'Liver and lights and gall and all!<BR>
Liver and lights and gall and all!'</P></DIR>

<P>Away he went again, and came to where a man had a pain in his liver, bawling out:</P><DIR>

<P>'Liver and lights and gall and all!<BR>
Liver and lights and gall and all!'</P></DIR>

<P>Whereon the man laid hold of him and beat him, bidding him say:</P><DIR>

<P>'Pray God send no more!<BR>
Pray God send no more!'</P></DIR>

<P>The youngster strode along, uttering these words, till he reached a field where a hind was sowing wheat:</P><DIR>

<P>'Pray God send no more!<BR>
Pray God send no more!'</P></DIR>

<P>This was all his cry. So the sower began to thrash him, and charged him to repeat:</P><DIR>

<P>'Pray God send plenty more!<BR>
Pray God send plenty more!'</P></DIR>

<P>Off the child scampered with these words in his mouth till he reached a churchyard and met a funeral, but he went on with his:</P><DIR>

<P>'Pray God send plenty more!<BR>
Pray God send plenty more!'</P></DIR>

<P>The chief mourner seized and punished him, and bade him repeat:</P><DIR>

<P>'Pray God send the soul to heaven!<BR>
Pray God send the soul to heaven!'</P></DIR>

<P>Away went the boy, and met a dog and a cat going to be hung, but his cry rang out:</P><DIR>

<P>'Pray God send the soul to heaven!<BR>
Pray God send the soul to heaven!'</P></DIR>

<P>The good folk nearby were furious, seized and struck him, charging him to say:</P><DIR>

<P>'A dog and a cat agoing to be hung!<BR>
A dog and a cat agoing to be hung!'</P></DIR>

<P>This the poor fellow did, till he overtook a man and a woman going to be married. 'Oh, oh!' he shouted:</P><DIR>

<P>'A dog and a cat agoing to be hung!<BR>
A dog and a cat agoing to be hung!'</P></DIR>

<P>The man was enraged, as we may well think, gave him many a thump, and ordered him to repeat:</P><DIR>

<P>'I wish you much joy!<BR>
I wish you much joy!'</P></DIR>

<P>This he did, jogging along, till he came to two labourers who had fallen into a ditch. The lad kept bawling out:</P><DIR>

<P>'I wish you much joy!<BR>
I wish you much joy!'</P></DIR>

<P>This vexed one of the folk so sorely that he used all his strength, scrambled out, beat the crier, and told him to say:</P><DIR>

<P>'The one is out, I wish the other was!<BR>
The one is out, I wish the other was!'</P></DIR>

<P>On went young 'un till he found a fellow with only one eye; but he kept up his song:</P><DIR>

<P>'The one is out, I wish the other was!<BR>
The one is out, I wish the other was!'</P></DIR>

<P>This was too much for Master One-eye, who grabbed him and chastised him, bidding him call:</P><DIR>

<P>'The one side gives good light, I wish the other did!<BR>
The one side gives good light, I wish the other did!'</P></DIR>

<P>So he did, to be sure, till he came to a house, one side of which was on fire. The people here thought it was he who had set the place a-blazing, and straightway put him in prison. The end was, the judge put on his black cap, and condemned him to die.</P>
