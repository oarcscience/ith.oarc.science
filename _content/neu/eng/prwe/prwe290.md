WHISTLING

 TO whistle by night is one of the unpardonable sins amongst the
fishermen of St Ives. My correspondent says, "I would no more dare go
among a party of fishermen at night whistling a popular air than into a
den of untamed tigers."

No miner will allow of whistling underground. I could never learn from
the miners whether they regarded it as unlucky or not. I rather think
they feel that whistling indicates thoughtlessness, and they know their
labour is one of danger, requiring serious attention.
