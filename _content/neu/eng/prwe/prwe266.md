THE SUN NEVER SHINES ON THE PERJURED

 THERE appears to exist a very old superstition, to the effect that when
a man has deeply perjured himself--especially if by his perjury he has
sacrificed the life of a friend,--he not merely loses the enjoyment of
the sunshine, but he actually loses all consciousness of its light or
its warmth. Howsoever bright the sun may shine, the weather appears to
him gloomy, dark, and cold.

I have recently been told of a man living in the western part of
Cornwall, who is said to have sworn away the life of an innocent person.
"The face of this false witness is the colour of one long in the tomb;
and he has never, since the death of the victim of his forswearing, seen
the sun." It must be remembered the perjured man is not blind. All
things around him are seen as by other men, but the sense of vision is
so dulled that the world is for ever to him in a dark, vapoury cloud.
