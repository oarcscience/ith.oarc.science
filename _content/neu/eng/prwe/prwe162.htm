<P ALIGN="CENTER">KING ARTHUR IN THE FORM OF A CHOUGH.</p>
<P>I QUOTE the following as it stands :-- [a]</p>
<P>&quot;In Jarvis's translation of ' Don Quixote,' book ii.
chap. V., the following passage occurs --</p>
<P>&quot;'Have you not read, sir,' answered Don Quixote, 'the
annals and histories of England, wherein are recorded the famous exploits of
King Arthur, whom, in our Castilian tongue, we always call King Artus; of
whom there goes an old tradition, and a common one, all over that kingdom of
Great Britain, that this king did not die, but that, by magic art, he was
turned into a raven; and that, in process of time, he shall reign again and
recover his kingdom andi sceptre, for which reason it Cannot be proved that,
from that time to this, any Englishmen has killed a raven ?'</p>
<P>.&quot;My reason for transcribing this passage is to record the
curious fact that the legend of King Arthur's existence in the form of a
raven was still repeated as a piece of folk-lore in Cornwall about sixty
years ago. My father, who died about two years since, at the age of eighty,
spent a few years of his youth in the neighbourhood of Penzance. One day he
was walking along Marazion Green with his fowling-piece on his shoulder, he
saw a raven at a distance, and fired at it. An old man who was near
immediately rebuked him, telling him that he ought on no account to have
shot at a raven, for that King Arthur was still alive in the form of that
bird. My father was much interested when I drew his attention to the passage
which I have quoted above,</p>
<P>&quot;Perhaps some of your Cornish or Welsh correspondents may
be able to say whether the legend is still known among the peopleof Cornwall
or Wales. </p>
<P>EDGAR MACCULLOCH.<br>
&quot;GUERNSEY.&quot;</p>
<P>I have been most desirous of discovering if any such
legend as the above exists. I have questioned people in every part of
Cornwall in which King Arthur has been reported to have dwelt or fought, and
especially have I inquired in the neighbourhood of Tintagel, which is
reported to have been Arthur's stronghold. Nowhere do I find the raven
associated with him, but I have been told that bad luck would follow the man
who killed a Chough, for Arthur was transformed into one of these birds.</p>
