THE DROWNED "HAILING
THEIR NAMES."</p>
<P><i>
&nbsp;</i>THE fishermen dread to walk at night near those parts of the I shore
where there may have been wrecks. The souls of the drowned sailors appear to
haunt those. spots, and the "calling of the dead" has frequently been heard.
I have been told that, under certain circumstances, especially before the
coming of storms, or at certain seasons, but always at night, these callings
are common. Many a fisherman has declared he has heard the voices of dead
sailors "hailing their own names."</p>
