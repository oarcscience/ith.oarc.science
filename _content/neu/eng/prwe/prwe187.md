THE SAILOR WIZARD.

THIS appears to have been, and it may still be, a very common
superstition. I have lately received from Mr T. Q. Couch of Bodmin the
story of some sailors, who had reason to suspect that one of their body
was a wizard. This was eventually proved to have been the case, by
circumstances in every way resembling those of our old witch. There had
been a quarrel, and revenge had been talked of. The sailors were all
grouped together in the forepart of the ship, except the suspected one,
and a toad fell sprawling amongst them. One of the men flung the
creature into the fire in the caboose. It struggled for a moment in the
fire, and then by a convulsive effort flung itself out. Immediately the
toad was caught up by one of the men, and flung into the sea.

In the course of some little time the absent sailor made his appearance
dripping wet. In a drunken frolic he had first fallen into the fire at a
low beer shop or "Kiddle-e-wink," and subsequently he fell out of the
boat into the sea.
