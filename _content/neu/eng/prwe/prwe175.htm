<P ALIGN="CENTER">HOW PENGERSWICK BECAME A SORCERER.</p>
<P>THE first Pengerswick, by whom the castle, which still
bears his name, was built, was a proud man, and desired to ally himself with
some of the best families of Cornwall. He wished his son to wed a lady who
was very much older than himself; who is said to have been connected with
the Godolphin family. This elderly maiden had a violent desire either for
the young man or the castle--it is not very clear which. The young
Pengerswick gave her no return for the manifestations of love which she
lavished upon him. Eventually, finding that all her attempts to win the
young man's love were abortive, and that all the love-potions brewed for her
by the Witch of Fraddam were of no avail, she married the old lord--mainly,
it is said, to be revenged on the son.</p>
<P>The witch had a niece who, though poor, possessed
considerable beauty; she was called Bitha. This young girl was frequently
employed by her aunt and the lady of Godolphin to aid them in their spells
on the young Pengerswick, and, as a natural consequence, she fell
desperately in love with him herself. Bitha ingratiated herself with the
lady of Pengerswick, now the stepmother of the young man, and was selected
as her maid. This gave her many opportunities of seeing and speaking to
young Pengerswick, and her passion increased. The old step dame was still
passionately fond of the young man, and never let a chance escape her which
she thought likely to lead to the excitement of passion in his heart towards
her. In all her attempts she failed. Her love was turned to hate; and having
seen her stepson in company with Bitha, this hate was quickened by the more
violent jealousy. Every means which her wicked mind could devise were
employed to destroy the young man. Bitha had learned from her aunt, the
Witch of Fraddam, much of her art, and she devoted herself to counteract the
spells of her mistress.</p>
<P>The stepmother failing to accomplish her ends, resolved
to ruin young Pengerswick with his father. She persuaded the old man that
his son really entertained a violent passion for her, and that she was
compelled to confine herself to her tower in fear. The aged woman prevailed
on Lord Pengerswick to hire a gang of outlandish sailors to carry his son
away and sell him for a slave, giving him to believe that she should herself
in a short time present him with an heir.</p>
<P>The young Pengerswick escaped all their plots, and at his
own good time he disappeared , from the castle, and for a long period was
never heard of.</p>
<P>The mistress and maid plotted and counter-plotted to
secure the old Pengerswick's wealth; and when he was on his death-bed, Bitha
informed him of the vile practices of his wife, and consoled him with the
information that he was dying from the effects of poison given him by her.</p>
<P>The young lord, after long years, returned from some
Eastern lands with a princess for his wife, learned in all the magic
sciences of those enchanted lands. He found his stepmother shut up in her
chamber, with her skin covered with scales like a serpent, [a] from the
effects of the poisons which she had so often been distilling for the old
lord and his son. She refused to be seen, and eventually cast herself into
the sea, to the relief of all parties.</p>
<P>Bitha fared not much better. She lived on the Downs in St
Hilary; and from the poisonous fumes she had inhaled, and from her dealings
with the devil, her skin became of the colour of that of a <i>toad.</p>
