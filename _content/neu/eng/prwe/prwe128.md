SAINT KEYNE.

BRAGHAN, or Brechan, was a king in Wales, and the builder of the town of
Brecknock. This worthy old king and saint was the happy father of
twenty-six children, or, as some say, twenty-tour. Of these, fourteen or
fifteen were sainted for their holiness, and their portraits are
preserved within a fold of the kingly robe of the saint, their father,
in the window at St Neot's Church, bearing the inscription, "Sante
Brechane, cum omnibus sanctis, ora pro nobis," and known as the young
women's window.

Of the holy children settled in Cornwall, we learn that the following
gave their names to Comish churches

1\. John, giving name to the Church of St lve.

2\. Endellient, ,, Endellion.

3\. Menfre, ,, ,, St Minver.

4\. Tethe, ,, ,, St Teath

5\. Mabena, ,, ,, St Mabyn.

*6.* Merewenna, ,, Marham

*7.* Wenna, ,, ,, St Wenn.

8\. KEYNE, ,, ST KEYNE.

9\. Yse, ,, ,, St lssey.

10\. Morwenna ,, Morwinstow.

11\. Cleder, ,, -,, St Clether

12\. Keri, ,, ,, Egloskerry.

13\. Helie, ,, ,, Egloshayle.

14\. Adwent, ,, ,, Advent.

15\. Lanent, ,, ,, Lelant \[a\]

Of this remarkable family St Keyne stands out as the brightest star.
Lovely beyond measure, she wandered over the country safe, even in
lawless times, from insult, by "the strength of her purity."

We find this virtuous woman performing miracles wherever she went. The
district now known by the name of Keynsham, in Somersetshire, was in
those days infested with serpents. St Keyne, rivalling St Hilda of the
Northern Isle, changed them all into coils of stone, and there they are
in the quarries at the present time to attest the truth of the legend.
Geologists, with more learning than poetry, term them Ammonites,
deriving their name from the horn of Jupiter Ammon, as if the Egyptian
Jupiter was likely to have charmed serpents in England. We are satisfied
to leave the question for the consideration of our readers. After a life
spent -in the conversion of sinners, the building of churches, and the
performance of miracles, this good woman retired into Cornwall, and in
one of its most picturesque valleys she sought and found that quiet
which was conducive to a happy termination of a well-spent life. She
desired, above all things, "peace on earth;" and she hoped to benefit
the world, by giving to woman a chance of being equal to her lord and
master. A beautiful well of water was near the home of the saint, and
she planted, with her blessing, four trees around it--the withy, the
oak, the elm, and the ash. When the hour of her death was drawing near,
St Keyne caused herself to be borne on a litter to the shade which she
had formed, and soothed by the influence of the murmur of the flowing
fountain, she blessed the waters, and gave them their wondrous power,
thus quaintly described by Carew--" Next, I will relate to you another
of the Cornish natural wonders--viz., St Keyne's Well; but lest you make
wonder, first at the sainte, before you notice the well, you must
understand that this Was not Kayne the Manqueller, but one of a gentler
spirit and milder sex--to wit, a woman. He who caused the spring to be
pictured, added this rhyme for an explanation :--

'In name, in shape, in quality,  
This well is very quaint;  
The name to lot of Kayne befell,  
No over-holy saint.  
The shape, four trees of divers kind,  
Withy, oak, elm, and ash,  
Make with their roots an arched roof, Whose floor this spring does
wash.  
The quality, that man or wife,  
Whose chance or choice attains,  
First of this sacred stream to drink,  
Thereby the mastery gains.' \[b\]

Well of St Keyne," by Robert Southey, in his "Ballads and Metrical
Tales," vol. i.; or of Southey's collected works, vol. vi.  
  
St Keyne, or St Keona, is said to have visited St Michael's Mount, and
imparted this peculiar virtue to a stone chair on the ewer.
