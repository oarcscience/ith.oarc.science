WEATHER SIGNS.

 THE WEATHER DOG--It frequently happens in unsettled weather that banks
of rain-cloud gather around the horizon, and that, over isolated tracts,
the rain falls. If these depositions from this low stratum of clouds
occur opposite to the sun, the lower limb of a bow is formed, often
appearing like a pillar of decom­posed light; and sometimes two of these
coloured bands will be seen, forming indeed the two extremities of the
arch. These are "weather dogs," and they are regarded as certain
prognostications of showery or stormy weather. \[a\]

 The usual proverb with regard to the full bow, which prevails
generally, is common in Cornwall--

 "The rainbow in the morning  
Is the shepherd's warning;  
The rainbow at night  
Is the shepherd's delight."

But, as far as I know, the "weather dog" is peculiarly Cornish,

\[a\]  "There appeared in the northeast the frustrum of a large rainbow;
all the colour, were lively and distinct, and it was three times as wide
as the arch of an ordinary complete rainbow, but no higher than it was
wide. They call it here, in Cornwall, *a* *weather dog;* but in the
Cornish language, Lagas-auel,--that is, the weather's eye,--and
pronounced it a certain sign of hard rain."--*Borlase's Natural History
of Cornwall.*
