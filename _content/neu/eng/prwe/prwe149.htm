<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE WELL AT ALTAR-NUN.</p>
<P>CURE OF INSANITY.</p>
<P>MONGST the numerous holy wells which exist in Cornwall,
that of Alternosi, or Altar-Nun, is the only one, as far as I can learn,
which possessed the virtue of curing the insane.</p>
<P>We are told that Saint Nunne or Nuanita was the daughter
of an Earl of Cornwall, and the mother of St David; that the holy well,
which is situated about a mile from the cathedral of St David, was dedicated
to her; and that she bestowed on the waters of the Cornish well those
remarkable powers, which were not given to the Welsh one, from her fondness
for the county of her birth.</p>
<P>Carew, in his &quot;Survey of Cornwall,&quot; thus describes the
practice :-- </p>
<P>&quot;The water running from St Nun's well fell into a square and
enclosed walled plot, which might be filled at what depth they listed. Upon
this wall was the frantic person put to stand, his back towards the pool,
and from thence, with a sudden blow in the breast, tumbled headlong into the
pond; where a strong fellow, provided for the nonce, took him, and tossed
him up and down, amongst and athwart the water, till the patient, by
foregoing his' strength, had somewhat forgot his fury. Then was he conveyed
to the church, and certain masses said over him; upon which handling, if his
right wits returned, St Nun had the thanks; but if there appeared small
amendment, he was bowssened again and again, while there remained in him any
hope of life or recovery.&quot;</p>
<P>The 2d of March is dedicated to St Nun, and the influence
of the water is greatly exalted on that day.</p>
<P>Although St Nun's well has been long famous, and the
celebrity of its waters extended far, yet there was a belief prevailing
amidst the uneducated, that the sudden shock produced by suddenly plunging
an insane person into water was most effective in producing a return to
reason.</p>
<P>On one occasion, a woman of weak mind, who was suffering
under the influence of a religious monomania, consulted me on the benefit
she might hope to receive from electricity. The burden of her
ever-melancholy tale was, that &quot;she had lost her God; &quot;and she told me, with
a strange mixture of incoherence and reason, that her conviction was, that a
sudden shock would cure her. She had herself proposed to her husband and
friends that they should take her to a certain rock on St Michael's Mount,
stand her on it, with her back to the sea, when &quot;the waters were the
strongest, at the flowing of the tide;&quot; and after having prayed with her,
give her the necessary blow on the chest, and thus plunge her into the
waters below. I know not that the experiment was ever made in the case of
this poor woman, but I have heard of several instances where this sudden
plunge had been tried as a cure for insanity.</p>
<P>Mr T. Q. Couch thus describes the present condition of
this well in a paper on &quot;Well-Worship: &quot; [a]</p>
<P>&quot;On the western side of the beautiful valley through
which flows the Trelawney River, and near Hobb's Park, in the parish of
Pelynt, Cornwall, is St Nun's, or St Ninnie's Well. Its position was, until
lately, to be discovered by the oak-tree matted with ivy, and the thicket of
willow and bramble which grew upon its roof. The front of the well is of a
pointed form, and has a rude entrance about four feet high, and spanned
above by a single flat stone, which leads into a grotto with arched roof.
The walls on the interior are draped with luxuriant fronds of spleenwort,
hart's-tongue, and a rich undercovering of liverwort. At the further end of
the floor is a round granite basin, with a deeply moulded brim, and
ornamented on' its circumference with a series of rings, each enclosing a
cross or a ball. The water weeps into it from an opening at the back, and
escapes again by a hole in the bottom. This interesting piece of antiquity
has been protected by a tradition which we could wish to attach to some of
our cromlechs and circles in danger of spoliation.&quot;</p>
<P>According to the narrative given by Mr Bond in his &quot;History
of Looe,&quot; the sacred</p>
<P>protection given must have been limited in time, as the
following story will prove :-- </p>
<P>&quot;KIPPISCOMBE LANE,</p>
<P>Probably so called from a consecrated well on the right
hand .side of the road. The titular saint of this well is supposed to have
been St Cuby, now corrupted into Keby's Well. The spring flows Into a
circular basin or reservoir of granite, or of some stone like it, two feet
four inches at its extreme diameter at top, and about two feet high. It
appears to have been neatly carved and ornamented in its lower part with the
figure of a griffin, and round the edge with dolphins, now much defaced. The
water was formerly carried off by a drain or hole at the bottom, like those
usually seen in fonts and piscinas. This basin (which I take to be an old
font) was formerly much respected by the neighbours, who conceived some
great misfortune would befall the person who should attempt to remove it
from where it stood, and that it required immense power to remove it. A
daring fellow, however (says a story), once went with a team of oxen for the
express purpose of removing it. On his arrival at the spot, one of the oxen
fell down dead, which so alarmed the fellow that he desisted from the
attempt he was about to make. There are several loose stones scattered round
this basin or reservoir, perhaps the remains of some building which formerly
enclosed it--a small chapel likely. The last time I saw this reservoir, it
had been taken many feet from where it used to stand, and a piece of the
brim of it had been recently struck off ?'</p>
