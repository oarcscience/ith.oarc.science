<P ALIGN="CENTER">J--H-- , THE CONJURER OF ST COLOMB.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;THIS old man was successful
in persuading his dupes that he owed his powers over evil spirits to his
superior learning and his unblemished life. This assumption of piety was
well preserved, and to the outside world his sanctity was undoubted. The
only practice which can be named as peculiar to H--was that of lighting
scores of candles and placing them around the meadow near his house. Of
course such a display would attract much attention; and J--succeeded in
conveying an impression to the minds of the country people that this
process was required to counteract the spells of the witches. When this
old fellow has been summoned, as he often was, to the houses supposed to
be under the influence of evil, or to be bewitched, his practice was not a
little original, though wanting in all that dignifies the office of an
exorcist. When he arrived at the house, before speaking to any one, he
would commence operations by beating with a heavy stick on the wooden
partitions, screens, or pieces of furniture, so as to make the greatest
possible noise, shouting loudly all the time, &quot;Out ! out ! out !--Away !
away ! away ! - to the Red Sea--to the Red Sea-- to the Red Sea.&quot;
Frequently he would add, with violent enunciation and much action, a
torrent of incoherent and often incomprehensible words (locally, &quot;<i>gibberish</i>&quot;).
The proceeding being brought to a close, and the spirits of evil flown,
every part of the house was ordered to be well cleansed, and the walls and
ceilings to be thoroughly lime-washed,--certainly the only sensible part
of the whole operation. When J--H--was applied to respecting stolen
property, his usual practice was to show the face of the thief in a tub of
water. J--drove a considerable trade in selling powders to throw over
bewitched cattle. [a]</p>
<P>[a] When cattle or human beings have been bewitched, it
was very commonly thought that if a bottle of urine from the diseased
beast or person was obtained, then corked very tight and buried mouth
downwards, that the witch would be afflicted with strangury, and in her
suffering confess her crime and beg forgiveness.</p>
