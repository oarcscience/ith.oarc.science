<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PARSON AND CLERK.</p>
<P>NEAR Dawlish stand, out in the sea, two rocks, of red
sand-stone conglomerate, to which the above name is given.</p>
<P>Seeing that this forms a part of Old Cornwall, I do not
go beyond my limits in telling the true story of these singular rocks.</p>
<P>The Bishop of Exeter was sick unto death at Dawlish. An
ambitious priest, from the east, frequently rode with his clerk to make
anxious inquiries after the condition of the dying bishop. It is whispered
that this priest had great hopes of occupying the bishop's throne in Exeter
Cathedral.</p>
<P>The clerk was usually the priest's guide; but somehow or
other, on a particularly stormy night, he lost the road, and they were
wandering over Haldon. Excessively angry was the priest, and very provoking
was the clerk. He led his master this way and that way, but they were yet
upon the elevated country of Haldon.</p>
<P>At length the priest, in a great rage, exclaimed, &quot; I
would rather have the devil for a guide than you.&quot; Presently the clatter of
horse's hoofs were heard, and a peasant, on a moor pony, rode up. The priest
told of his condition, and the peasant volunteered to guide them. On rode
peasant, priest, and clerk, and presently they were at Dawlish. The night
was tempestuous, the ride had quickened the appetite of the priest, and he
was wet through,--therefore, when his friend asked him to supper, as they
approached an old ruined house, through the windows of which bright lights
were shining, there, was no hesitation in accepting the invitation.</p>
<P>There were a host of friends gathered together--a
strange, wild-looking lot of men. But as the tables were laden with
substantial dishes, and black-jacks were standing thick around, the parson,
and the clerk too, soon made friends with all.</p>
<P>They ate and drank, and became most irreligiously
uproarious. The parson sang hunting songs, and songs in praise of a certain
old gentleman, with whom a priest should not have maintained any
acquaintance. These were very highly appreciated, and every man joined
loudly in the choruses. Night wore away, and at last news was brought that
the bishop was dead. This appeared to rouse up the parson, who was only too
eager to get the first intelligence, and go to work to secure the hope of
his ambition. So master and man mounted their horses, and bade adieu to
their hilarious friends.</p>
<P>They were yet at the door of the mansion--somehow or
other the horses did not appear disposed to move. They were whipped and
spurred, but to no purpose.</p>
<P>&quot;The devil 's in the horses,&quot; said the priest.</p>
<P>&quot;I b'lieve he is,&quot; said the clerk.</p>
<P>&quot;Devil or no devil, they shall go,&quot; said the parson,
cutting his horse madly with his heavy whip.</p>
<P>There was a roar of unearthly laughter.</p>
<P>The priest looked round--his drinking friends were all
turned into demons, wild with glee, and the peasant guide was an arch little
devil, looking on with a marvelously curious twinkle in his eyes. The noise
of waters was around them; and now the priest discovered that the mansion
had disappeared, and that waves beat heavy upon his horse's flanks, and
rushed over the smaller horse of his man.</p>
<P>Repentance was too late.</p>
<P>In the morning following this stormy night, two horses
were found straying on the sands at Dawlish; and clinging with the grasp of
death to two rocks, were found the parson and the clerk, There stand the
rocks to which the devil had given the forms of horses--an enduring
monument to all generations.</p>
