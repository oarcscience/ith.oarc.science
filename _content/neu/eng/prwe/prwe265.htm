<P>
&nbsp;A MUCILAGINOUS substance is found on the damp ground near
the granite quarries of Penryn, this is often very phosphorescent at
night. The country people regard this as the substance of shooting stars.
A tradesman of Penryn once brought me a bottle full of this substance for
analysis, informing me that the men employed at the quarries, whenever
they observed a shooting star, went to the spot near which they supposed
it to fall, and they generally found a hatful of this mucus. It is curious
that the Belgian peasants also call it &quot;the substance of shooting stars&quot;
(&quot; Phosphorescence,&quot; p. 109. By T. L. Phipson). This author says, &quot;I have
sketched the history of this curious substance in the <i>Journal d&#232;
M&#233;decine et de Pharmacologie</i> of Bruxelles, for 1855. It was analysed
chemically by Mulder, and anatomically by Carus, and from their
observations appears to be the peculiar mucus which envelops the eggs of
the frog. It swells to an enormous volume when it has free access to
water. As seen upon the damp ground in spring, it was often mistaken for
some species of fungus; it is, however, simply the spawn of frogs, which
has been swallowed by some large crows or other birds, and afterwards
vomited, from its peculiar property of swelling to an immense size in
their bodies.&quot;</p>
<P>In Mulder's account of its chemical composition given by
Berselius in his <i>Rapport Annual</i>, he distinguishes it by designation
of <i>mucilage atmosph&#233;rique. </p>
