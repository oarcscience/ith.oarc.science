THE VOICE FROM THE SEA.

A FISHERMAN or a pilot was walking one night on the sands at
Porth-Towan, when all was still save the monotonous fall of the light
waves upon the sand.

 He distinctly heard a voice from the sea exclaiming,--

 "The hour is come, but not the man."

 This was repeated three times, when a black figure, like that of a man,
appeared on the top of the hill. It paused for a moment, then rushed
impetuously down the steep incline, over the sands, and was lost in the
sea. In different forms this story is told all around the Cornish coast.
