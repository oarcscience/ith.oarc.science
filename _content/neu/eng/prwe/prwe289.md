THE CROAKING OF THE RAVEN

 THERE is a common feeling that the croaking of a raven over the house
bodes evil to some member of the family. The following incident, given
to me by a really intelligent man, illustrates the feeling : \[a\]

"One day our family were much annoyed by the continued croaking of a
raven over our house. Some of us believed it to be a token; others
derided the idea; but one good lady, our next-door neighbour, said,
'Just mark the day, and see if something does not come of it.' The day
and hour were carefully noted. Months passed away, and unbelievers were
loud in their boastings and inquiries after the token.

"The fifth month arrived, and with it a black-edged letter from
Australia, announcing the death of one of the members of the family in
that country. On comparing the dates of the death and the raven's croak,
they were found to have occurred on the same day."
