<P>
THE following superstitions are still
prevalent on the north coast of Cornwall :-- </p>
<P>
"This root (the sea-poppy), so much valued
for removing all pains in the breast, stomach, and intestines, is good
also for disordered lungs, and is so much better here than in other
places, that the apothecaries of Cornwall send hither for it; and some
people plant them in their gardens in Cornwall, and will not part with
them under sixpence a root. A very simple notion they have with regard to
this root, which falls not much short of the Druids' superstition in
gathering and preparing their selago and samolus. This root, you must
know, is accounted very good both as an emetic and cathar&#173;tic. If,
therefore, they design that it shall operate as the former, their constant
opinion is that it should be scraped and sliced upwards--that is,
beginning from the root, the knife is to ascend towards the leaf;--but if
that it is intended to operate as a cathartic, they must scrape the root
downwards. The <i>senecio</i> also, or groundsel, they strip upwards for
an emetic and down' wards for a cathartic. In Cornwall they have several
such groundless opinions with regard to plants, and they gather all the
medicinal ones when the moon is just such an age; which, with many other
such whims, must be considered as the reliques of the Druid superstition."

They, the 'Druids, likewise used great,
ceremonies in gathering,. an herb called <i>samolus</i>, marsh-wort, or
fen-berries, which consisted in a previous fast, in not looking back
during the time of their plucking it, and, lastly, in using their left
hand only; from this last ceremony, perhaps, the herb took the name of <i>
samol</i>, which, in the Phoenician tongue, means the left hand. This herb
was considered to be particularly' efficacious in curing the diseases
incident to swine and cattle.--( C. S. Gilbert.)</p>
