<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE KEY OF THE GIANT'S CASTLE.</p>
<P><br>
THE giant's castle at Treryn, remarkable as a grand example of truly British
Cyclopean architecture, was built by the power of enchantment. The giant to
whom all the rest of his race were indebted for this stronghold was in every
way a remark-able mortal. He was stronger than any other giant, and he was a
mighty necromancer. He sat on the promontory of Treryn, and by the power of
his will he compelled the castle to rise out of the sea. it is only kept in
its present position by virtue of a magic key. This the giant placed in a
holed rock, known as the Giant's Lock, and whenever this key, a large round
stone, can be taken out of the lock, the promontory of Treryn and its castle
will disappear beneath the waters. There are not many people who obtain even a
sight of this wonderful key. You must pass at low tide along a granite ledge,
scarcely wide enough for a goat to stand on. If you happen to make a false
step, you must be dashed to pieces on the rocks below. Well, having got over
safely, you come to a pointed rock with a hole in it; this is the castle lock.
Put your hand deep into the hole, and you will find at the bottom a large
egg-shaped stone, which is easily moved in any direction. You will feel
certain that you can take it out,--but try! Try as you may, you will find it
will not pass through the hole; yet no one can doubt but that it once went in.</p>
<P>Lieutenant Goldsmith dissolved one bit of superstition by
foolishly throwing the fatal Logan Stone from off its bearing; but no one has
ever yet succeeded in removing the key of the giant's castle from the hole in
which the necromancer is said to have placed it when he was dying.<br>
