THE SAINT'S PATH.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;The path along which St Leven was
accustomed to walk from Bodellen, by Rospletha, on to St Leven's Rocks, as
they are still called, may be yet seen; the grass grows greener wherever the
good priest trod than in any other part of the fields through which the
footpath passes.</p>
