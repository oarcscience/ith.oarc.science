<P ALIGN="CENTER">ST PIRAN'S-DAY AND PICROUS-DAY.</p>
<P>HONE, in his &quot;Every-Day Book,&quot; has the following remarks
on St Piran :</p>
<P>&quot;This saint, anciently of good repute in Cornwall, is not
mentioned by Butler. According to Porter, he was born in Ireland, and became
a hermit there. He afterwards came to England, and settling at Cornwall, had
a grave made for hint, entered into it, and dying on the 6th of March, 'in
the glorie of a great light and splendour that appeared at the same
instant,' was buried at Padstow. 'He is reported,' says Porter, 'to have
wrought manie wonderful miracles in his lifetime, which, because they tend
rather to breed an incredulous amazement in the readers, than move to anie
workes of virtues or pietie, we have willingly omitted.' We have had a
specimen of such miracles as Father Porter deemed worthy of belief; those of
St Piran, which would have caused 'incredulous amassment' in Porter's
readers, must have been 'passing wonderful.'&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;<i>St .Piran's.day</i> is said to be a favourite with
the tinners. Having a tradition that some secrets regarding the manufacture
of tin was communicated to their ancestors by that saint, they leave the
manufacture to shift for itself for that day, and keep it as a holiday.&quot; [a]</p>
<P>Mr T. Q. Couch obligingly favours me with the following note
on Picous-day:-- </p>
<P>&quot;The second Thursday before Christmas-day is a festival
observed by the tinners of the district of Blackmore, and known as .Picrous
day. It is not at present marked by any distinctive ceremonies, but it is
the occasion of a supper and much merry-making. The owner of the tin-stream
contributes a shilling a man towards it.<i> This is said to be the feast of
the discovery of tin by a man named Picrous</i>. My first impression was
that the day took its name from the circumstance of a pie forming the pi&#232;ce
de r&#233;sistance of the supper; butt this explanation is not allowed by tinners,
nor sanctioned by the usages of the feast. What truth there may be in the
tradition of the first tinner, Picrous, it is now too late to discover, but
the notion is worth recording. It has occurred to me whether, from some
similarity between the names (not a close one, I admit it), the honours of
Picrous may not have been transferred to St Piran, who is generally said to
be the patron saint of tunners. St Piran is not known in Blackmore, and his
festival is on the <sub>5</sub>th of March. The tinners also have a festival
to commemorate the discovery of smelting.&quot;</p>
