THE "HA-AF" A FACE.

JAMES BERRYMAN said, "Fa-ather took a house doun to Lelant, whear we
lived for a bra' bit. Very often after I ben in bed, our ould cat wud
tear up, coover its ars like a ma-aged thing, jump uppon the bed, and
dig her ould hed under the clothes, as if she wud git doun to bottom,
and jest after, a man's face, with a light round un, wud cum in; kwas
ha-af a face like, and it wud stop at the bottom of the bed. I 'ye sen
it many times; and fa-ather, though he didn't say nothin', was glad
enough to leave the place. I was tould that the house belonged to an
ould man, and that two rich gentlemen, brothers, who lived close by,
wanted the place, and put on law, and got the place from the poor ould
man. When they war goin' to turn un out, the poor fellow stopped and
looked round crying, and then fell down in a fit, was put to bed, and
died in the house; and 'twas he, they said, that used to come back."
