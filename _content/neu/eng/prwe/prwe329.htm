<P ALIGN="CENTER">CORNISH DIALOGUE</p>
<P>AS the Cornish dialogue peculiarly illustrates a
description of literary composition which has no resemblance to that of
any county, I think it advisable to give one specimen :-- </p>
<u>
<P>DIALOGUE BETWEEN MAL TRELOARE AND SAUNDRY KEMP.</p>
</u><b>
<ul>
</b>
<P>'Twas
Kendle teening, when jung Mal Treloare</p>
<P>Trudg'd
hum from Bal, a bucken copper ore;</p>
<P>Her
clathing hard and ruff, black was her eye,</p>
<P>Her face
and arms like stuff from Cairn Kye.</p>
<P>Full
butt she mit jung Saundry Kemp, who long</p>
<P>She had
been token'd to, come from Ding Dong;</p>
<P>Hes
jacket wet, his faace rud like his beard,</p>
<P>And
through his squarded hat hes hair appeared.</p>
<P>She
said, &quot;Oh, Kemp, I thoft of thee well leer,</p>
<P>Thees

<P>That

<P>Thees

<P>I love

<P>And to

<P>Now,

<P>Do lem

<i>
<P>Saundry.
</i>Why, then, Crull said jue wor down to Wheal Bog</p>
<P>With he

<P>Aand

<P>'Now

<P>Ef thee

<P>Fust jue

<P>Aant
Blanch and I went to Golsinny feer.</p>
<P>Who 
overtookt us in the doosty road,</p>
<P>In
common hum but Crull, the cloppen toad.</p>
<P>Zes he
to Aant, &quot;What cheer? Aant Blanch, what cheer?</p>
<P>Jue

<P>&quot;Why,

<P>I wedn

<b>

<P>By this

<P>We went

</ul>
<P>(Haw

<P>Zes hem

<P>Come tha

<P>&quot;How

<P>Zes I, &quot;Jue

<P>Keep off<i>,
</i>jung lad, else thees have a slap.&quot;</p>
<P>Then haw
fooch'd some great big doat figs in me lap.</p>
<P>So I

<P>Haw

<P>Aand so

<P>&quot;Araeh!&quot;
zes haw, &quot;I dedn't mane no harm.&quot;</p>
<P>So then
Aant Blanch and he ded talk and jest</p>
<P>Bout
dabbing clay and bricks at Petran feast. </p>
<i>
<P>Saundry.
</i>Ahab then, Ma!, 'twas there they dabbed the clay </p>
<i>
<P>Mal. </i>
Plaase Father, Kemp, tes true wot I do saay.</p>
<P>And hire

<P>From
Aanty's arm till jest this side Long Brudge</p>
<P>Aand

<P>To
Aafe-waye house, and have a dram of gin</p>
<P>And
trickle mixt? Depend ol do es good,</p>
<P>Taake up

<P>So Aant
did saay, &quot;Such things she dedn 't<b> </b>chuse,&quot;</p>
<P>And
squeezed my hand, aand bike a thing refuse.</p>
<P>So when

<P>So when
haw wish'd good night, as es the caase,</p>
<P>Haw kiss
<b>'</b>t<b> </b>Aant Blanch, and jist neen touched my face.</p>
<P>Now,
Saundry Kemp, there's nothing sure in this,</p>
<P>To my

<i>
<P>Saundry.
</i>No, fath, then Ma!, ef this is all aand true,</p>
