MINERS' SUPERSTITIONS</h3>
<h3>MINERS say they
often see little imps or demons underground. Their presence is considered
favourable; they indicate the presence of lodes, about which they work
during the absence of the miners. A miner told my informant that he had
often seen them, sitting on pieces of timber, or tumbling about in curious
attitudes, when he came to work.</h3>
<h3>Miners do not like
the form of the cross being made underground. A friend of my informant,
going through some "levels" or "adits," made a + by the side of one, to know
his way back, as he would have to return by himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was compelled to
alter it into another form.</h3>
<h3>If miners see a
snail when going to "bal" in the morning, they always drop a piece of tallow
from their candles by its side.</h3>
