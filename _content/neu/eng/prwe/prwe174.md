CORNISH SORCERERS.

THE powers of the sorcerer appear to have been passed on from father to
son through a long succession of generations.

There are many families--the descendants from the ancient Cornish
people--who are even yet supposed to possess remarkable powers of one
kind or another. Several families, which have become extinct, are more
especially reputed by tradition to have had dealings with the bad
spirits, and mans of them to have made compacts with the Evil One
himself. Amongst the most curious of the stories once told,--I believe
they are nearly all forgotten,--are those connected with Pengerswick
Castle. A small tower alone remains to note the site of a once famous
fortified place. This castle was said to have been occupied, in the time
of Henry VIII., by a man who had committed some great crime; but long
previous to that period the place was famous for its wickedness. \[a\]
