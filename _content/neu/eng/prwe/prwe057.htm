<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHENEY'S HOUNDS.</p>
<P><br>
IN the parish of St Teath, a pack of hounds was once kept by an old squire
named Cheney. How he or they died I cannot learn; but on &quot;Cheney Downs&quot; the
ghosts of the dogs are sometimes seen, and often heard, in rough weather.</p>
<P>In the western parishes of the county, I can name several
places which are said to be haunted by the &quot;wish hounds.&quot; [a]</p>
<P>[a] See Athenaeum, No. 1013, March 27,
1847. See Appendix L for Notes on the BARGEST.</p>
