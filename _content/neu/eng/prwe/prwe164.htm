<P ALIGN="CENTER">SLAUGHTER BRIDGE.</p>
<P>HISTORIANS and poets have made the world familiar with
King Arthur. We know how Merlin deceived, by his magic, the beautiful
Igerna, so that she received King Uter as her husband. We know also that
Uter P.endragon died, and that his son, by Igerna, reigned King of Britain.
How Arthur ruled, and how he slaughtered all the enemies of Britain, is told
in the chronicles. But even at Tintagel [a] all is silent respecting the
king or his celebrated Round Table.</p>
<P>&quot;In the days of King Arthur the Mount of Cornwall was
kept by a monstrous giant,&quot; is familiar to us all; and it is curious to find
a tradition that the extirpation of these Titans was due to Arthur and
Christianity, as already related. At Slaughter Bridge I heard the story, but
it did not sound like a tradition; the true native character was not in the
narrative,--That in 824 the Cornish and Saxons fought so bloody a battle
that the river ran red with blood. On Slaughter Bridge Arthur is said to
have killed his nephew, Modred, but that, previously to this last fight,
Modred wounded his uncle with a poisoned sword, nearly in front of
Worthyvale House. A single stone laid over a stream, having some letters cut
on ifs lower surface, is believed to mark the exact spot where Arthur
received his death-wound.</p>
<P>
[a]&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall offer conjecture touching the name of this place, which I
will not say is right, but only probable. <i>Tin </i>is the same as <i>Din,
Dines, </i>and <i>Diveth, </i>deceit; so that <i>
Tindixel, </i>
turned, for easier pronunciation, to <i>
Tintagel, Dindagel, </i>or <i>Daundagel&nbsp; </i>
signifies <i>Castle of Deceit, </i>which name might be aptly given to it
from the famous deceit practised here by Uter Pendragon by the help of
Merlin's enchantment."--Tonkin.</p>
