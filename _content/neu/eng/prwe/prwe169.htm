<P ALIGN="CENTER">NOTES ON WITCHCRAFT.</p>
<P>IN confirmation of the melancholy facts related of the
continuance of the belief in witchcraft, I would give the accompanying
cuttings from the <i>West Briton </i>newspaper of a very recent date</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">GROSS SUPERSTITION.</p>
<P>&quot;During the week ending Sunday last, a 'wise man' from
Illogan has been engaged with about half-a-dozen witchcraft cases, one a
young trades-man, and another a sea-captain. It appears that the 'wise man'
was in the first place visited at his home by these deluded people at
different times, and he declared the whole of them to be spell-bound. In one
case he said that if the person had not come so soon, in about a fortnight
he would have been in the asylum; another would have had his leg broken; and
in every case something very direful would have happened. Numerous
incantations have been performed. In the case of a captain of a vessel, a
visit as paid to the sea-side, and while the 'wise man' uttered some
unintelligible gibberish, the captain had to threw a stone into the sea. So
heavy was the spell under which he laboured, and which immediately fell upon
the 'wise man,' that the latter pretended that he could scarcely walk back
to Hayle. The most abominable part of the incantations is performed during
the hours of midnight, and for that purpose the wretch sleeps with his
victims, and for five nights following he had five different bedfellows.
Having no doubt reaped a pretty good harvest during the week, he returned to
his home on Monday; but such was the pretended effect produced by the
different spells and witchcraft that tell upon him from his many dupes, that
two of the young men who had been under his charge were obliged to obtain a
horse and cart and carry him to the Hayle station. One of the men, having
had 'two spells' resting on him, the 'wise man' was obliged to, sleep with
him on Saturday and Sunday nights, having spent the whole of the Sunday in
his diabolical work. It is time that the police, or some other higher
authorities, should take the matter up, as the person alluded to is well
known, and frequently visited by the ignorant and superstitious.&quot;</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CASE OF GROSS SUPERSTITION AT
HAYLE.</p>
<P>&quot;In the <i>West Briton </i>of the 27th ult. we gave some
particulars of several cases of disgraceful fraud and delusion which had
been practised by a pretended 'wise man' from Illogan, and of gross
superstition and gullibility on the part of his dupes. A correspondent has
furnished us with the following particulars relative to the antecedents of
the 'pretended conjurer. He states that James Thomas, the conjurer from the
parish of Illogan, married, some titue since the late celebrated Tammy Blee,
of Redruth, who afterwards removed to Helston and carried on as a
fortune-teller, but parted from her husband, James Thomas, on account of a
warrant for his apprehension having been issued against him by the
magistrates of St Ivea, for attempting to take a spell from Mrs Paynter,
through her husband, William Paynter, who stated before the magistrates that
he wanted to commit a disgraceful offence. Thomas then absconded, and was
absent from the west of Cornwall for upwards of two years. His wife then
stated that the virtue was in her and not in him; that she was of the real
'Pellar' blood; and that he could tell nothing but through her. His greatest
dupes have been at St Just and Hayle, and other parts of the west of
Cornwall. He has been in the habit of receiving money annually for keeping
witchcraft from vessels sailing out of Hayle. He slept with several of his
dupes recently; and about a fortnight since he stated that he must sleep
with certain young men at Copperhouse, Hayle, in order to protect them from
something that was hanging over them, one of them being a mason and another
a miner, the two latter lately from St Just. He said himself this week at
Truro that he had cured a. young man of St Erth, and was going on Saturday
again to take a spell froth the father, a tin-smelter. He baa caused ka
great disturbance amongst the neighbours, by charging some with having
bewitched others. He is a drunken, disgraceful, beastly fellow, and ought to
be sent to the treadmill. One of the young men is now thoroughly ashamed of
himself to think he has been duped so by this scoundrel. We have purposely
withheld the names of a number of Thomas's egregious dupes, with which our
correspondent has furnished us, believing that the badgering which they have
doubtless received from their friends has proved a sufficient punishment to
them, and that their eyes are now thoroughly opened to the gross and
disgraceful imposture that has been practised upon them.&quot;</p>
<P>The following is from the <i>Western Morning News</p>
</i>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">CALLING A WOMAN A WITCH.</p>
<P>&quot;At the Liskeard police court, on Monday, Harriet King
appeared before the sitting magistrates charged with an assault on Elizabeth
Wellington. The complainant had called the mother of defendant a witch, and
said she had ill-wished a person, and the ill wish fell on the cat, and the
cat died. This annoyed the daughter, who retaliated by bad words and blows.
The magistrates expressed surprise at the cause of the assault, h as that
had been proved, they fined defendant Is. and the costs, &#163;1 in all.</p>
