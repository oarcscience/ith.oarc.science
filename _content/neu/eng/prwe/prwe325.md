BOYER, MAYOR OF BODMIN

IN the reign of Edward VI., Boyer was the mayor of Bodmin, and he
appears to have been suspected of aiding in an insurrection of the men
of Devonshire and Cornwall. However this may be, Sir Anthony Kingston,
provost-marshal of the king's army, sent orders to Boyer to have a
gibbet erected in the street opposite his own house by the next day at
noon. He, at the same time, sent his compliments to the mayor, telling
him that he should dine with him, in order to be present at the
execution of some rebels.

The unsuspecting mayor obeyed the command, and at the time appointed
provided an entertainment for his guest. Kingston put about the wine,
and when he observed the mayor's spirits were exhilarated, asked him if
the gibbet was ready. Being told that it was, with a wanton and
diabolical sneer he ordered the mayor to hanged upon it.

At the same time a miller was ordered to be hanged; his servant was so
deeply attached to him, that he went to Kingston and begged him to spare
his master's life, even if he hung him in his place. "If you are so fond
of hanging," said Kingston, "you shall not be disappointed," and he
hanged the miller and his servant together.

A similar story is told of a mayor of St Ives.
