THE PHANTOM SHIP.

YEARS long ago, one night, a gig's crew was called to go off to a
"hobble," to the westwards of St Ives Head. No sooner was one boat
launched than several others were put off from the shore, and a stiff
chase was maintained, each one being eager to get to the ship, as she
had the appearance of a foreign trader. The hull was clearly visible,
she was a schooner-rigged vessel, with a light over her bows.

Away they pulled, and the boat which had been first launched still kept
ahead by dint of mechanical power and skill. All the men had thrown off
their jackets to row with more freedom. At length the helmsman cried
out, "Stand ready to board her." The sailor rowing the bow oar slipped
it out of the row-lock, and stood on the forethought, taking his jacket
on his arm, ready to spring aboard.

The vessel came so close to the boat that they could see the men, and
the bow-oar man made a grasp at her bulwarks. His hand found nothing
solid, and he fell, being caught by one of his mates, back into the
boat, instead of into the water. Then ship and lights disappeared. The
next morning the *Neptune* of London, Captain Richard Grant, was wrecked
at Gwithian, and all perished. The captain's body was picked up after a
few days, and that of his son also. They were both buried in Gwithian
churchyard.
