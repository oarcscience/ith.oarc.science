<P ALIGN="CENTER">CUDDEN POINT AND THE SILVER TABLE</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>THiS point is situated in the parish of Perranuthnoe; the
parish, it will be remembered, into which Trelawney escaped, aided by the
fleetness of his horse, from the deluge which buried the lands between this
and the Scilly Isles.</p>
<P>At the low-water of spring-tides, the children from all the
neighbourhood flock to the sands around this point, in the hope of finding
treasure, which they believe is buried in the sands beneath the sea, and which
is, it is said, occasionally discovered. Amongst other things, an especial
search is made for a silver table, which was lost by a very wealthy lord, by
some said to be the old Lord Pengerswick, who enriched himself by grinding
down the poor. On one occasion, when the calmness of summer, the clearness of
the skies, and the tranquillity of the waters invited the luxurious to the
enjoyments of the sea, this magnate, with a party of gay and thoughtless
friends, was floating in a beautiful boat lazily with the tide, and feasting
from numerous luxuries spread on a silver table. Suddenly--no one lived to
tell the cause--the boat sank in the calm, transparent waters; and, long
after the event, the fishermen would tell of sounds of revelry heard from
beneath the waters, and some have said they have seen these wicked ones still
seated around the silver table.</p>
