<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MUTTON FEAST.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;AN old tradition--the particulars of which I have failed
to recover--says that a flock of sheep were blown from the Gwithian Sands
over into St Ives Bay, and that the St Ives fishermen caught them,--
believing them to be a new variety of fish,--either in their nets, or
with hook and line, and brought them ashore as their night's catch.</p>
<P>I learn that Mr Fortescue Hitchins, some fifty or sixty
years since, wrote a &quot;copy of verses&quot; on this tradition, but I have never
seen this production.</p>
