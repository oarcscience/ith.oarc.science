<P>"I was saying to Jack, as we talk'd t' other day <BR>
About lubbers and snivelling elves,<BR>
That if people in life did not steer the right way, <BR>
They had nothing to thank but themselves. <BR>
Now, when a man's caught by those mermaids the girls<BR>
With their flattering palaver and smiles;<BR>
He runs, while he's list'ning to their fal de rals, <BR>
Bump ashore on the Scilly Isles."<BR></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PILOT'S GHOST STORY.</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;On a sudden shrilly sounding,<br>
Hideous yells and shrieks were heard;<br>
Then each heart with fear confounding,<br>
A sad troop of ghosts appear'd,<br>
All in dreary hammocks shrouded,<br>
Which for winding-sheets they wore.&quot;<br>
<i>Admiral Hosier's Ghost.</p>
</i>
<P>I PREFER giving this story in the words in which it was
communicated. For its singular character, it is a ghost story well worth
preserving :-- &quot;Just seventeen years since, I went down on the wharf from my
house one night about twelve and one in the morning, to see whether there
was any 'hobble,' and found a sloop, the <i>Sally </i>of St Ives (the <i>
Sally </i>was wrecked at St Ives one Saturday afternoon in the spring of
1862), in the bay, bound for Hayle. When I got by the White Hart
public-house, I saw a man leaning against a post on the wharf;--I spoke to
him, wished him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was, but to no
purpose. I was not to be easily frightened, for .1 didn't believe in ghosts;
and finding I got no answer to my repeated inquiries, I approached close to
him and said, 'Thee 'rt a queer sort of fellow, not to speak; I 'd speak to
the devil, if he were to speak to me. Who art a at all ? thee 'St needn't
think to frighten me; that thee wasn't do, if thou wert twice so ugly; who
art a at all ?.' He turned his great ugly face on me, glared abroad his
great eyes, opened his - mouth, and it was a mouth sure nuff. Then I saw
pieces of sea-weed and bits of sticks in his whiskers; the flesh of his face
and hands were parboiled, just like a woman's hands after a good day's
washing. Well, I did not like his looks a bit, and sheered off; but he
followed close by my side, and I could hear the water squashing in his shoes
every step he took. Well, I stopped a bit, and thought to be a little bit
civil to him, and spoke to him again, but no answer. I then thought I would
go to seek for another of our crew, and knock him up to get the vessel, and
had got about fifty or sixty yards, when I turned to see if he was following
me, but saw him where I left him. Fearing he would come after me, I ran for
my life the few steps that I had to go. But when I got to the door, to my
horror there stood the man in the door grinning horribly. I shook like an
aspen-leaf; my hat lifted from my head; the sweat boiled out of me. What to
do I didn't know, and in the house there was such a row, as if everybody was
breaking up everything. After a bit I went in, for the door was 'on the
latch,'--that is, not locked,--and called the captain of the boat, and got
light, but everything was all right, nor had he heard any noise. We went out
aboard of the <i>Sally, </i>and I put her into Hayle, but I felt ill enough
to be in bed. I left the vessel to come home as soon as I could, but it took
me four hours to walk two miles, and I had to lie down in the road, and was
taken home to St Ives in a cart; as far as the Terrace from there <i>I </i>
was carried home by my brothers, and put to bed. Three days afterwards all
my hair fell off as if I had had my head shaved. The roots, and for about
half an inch from the roots, being quite white. I was ill six months, and
the doctor's bill was &#163;4, 17s. 6d. for attendance and medicine. So you see I
have reason to believe in the existence of spirits as much as Mr Wesley had.
My hair grew again, and twelve months after I had as good a head of
dark-brown hair as ever.&quot; [a]</p>
