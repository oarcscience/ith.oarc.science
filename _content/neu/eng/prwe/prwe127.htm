<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE TWO BREAMS.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;Although in common with many of the churches in the remote
districts of Cornwall, &quot;decay's effacing fingers&quot; have been allowed to do
their work in St Leven Church, yet there still remains some of the
ornamental work which once adorned it. Much of the carving is irremediably
gone; but still the inquirer will find that it once told the story of
important events in the life of the good St Leven. Two fishes on the same
hook form the device, which appears at one time to have prevailed in this
church. These are to commemorate a remarkable incident in St Leven's life.
One lovely evening about sunset, St Leven was on his rocks fishing. There
was a heavy pull upon his line, and drawing it in, he found two breams on
the same hook. The good saint, anxious to serve both alike, to avoid,
indeed, even the appearance of partiality, took both the fishes off the
hook, and cast them back into the sea. Again they came to the hook, and
again were they returned to their native element. The line was no sooner
cast a third time than the same two fishes hooked themselves once more. St
Leven thought there must be some reason unknown to him for this strange
occurrence, so he took both the fishes home with him. When the saint reached
Bodellen, he found his sister, St Breage, [a] had come to visit him with two
children. Then he thought he saw the hand of Providence at work in guiding
the fish to his hook.</p>
<P>Even saints are blind when they attempt to fathom the
ways of the Unseen. The fish were, of course, cooked for supper; and the
saint having asked a blessing upon their savory meal, all sat down to
partake of it. The children had walked far, and they were ravenously hungry.
They ate their suppers with rapidity, and, not taking time to pick out the
bones of the fish, they were both choked. The apparent blessing was thus
transformed into a curse, and the bream has from that day forward ever gone
by the name, amongst fishermen, of &quot;choke children.&quot;</p>
<P>There are many disputes as to the fish concerned in this
legend. Some of the fishermen of St Leven parish have insisted upon their
being &quot;chad&quot;(the shad, <i>clupeida alosa); </i>while others, with the strong
evidence afforded by the bony structure of the fish, will have it to have
been the bream <i>(cyprinus brama). </i>My young readers, warned by the
name, should be equally careful in eating either of these fish.</p>
<P>[a] St Breock or Briock, a bishop
of a diocese in Armorics, is said to have been the patron saint of St
Breage. But there is a Cornish distict, &quot;Germow Mathern, Breoga Lavethas.&quot;
Germoe was a king, Brasga a midwife, which rather favours the statement that
St Breage 'was a sister of St Leven. Breage and Germoe are adjoining
parishes, having the shores of the Mount's Bay for their southen boundaries.
When the uncultivated inhabitants of this remote region regarded a wreck as
a &quot;God-send,&quot; and plundered without hesitation every body, living or dead,
thrown upon the shore, these parishes acquired a melancholy notoriety. The
sailors popular prayer being,</p>
<P>&quot;God keep us from rocks and
shelving sands,<br>
And save us from Breage and Germoe men's lands.&quot;</p>
<P>Happily those days are almost
forgotten. The ameliorating influences of the Christian faith, which was let
in upon a most benighted people by John Wesley, like a sunbeams, dispelled
those evil principles, and gave birth to pore and simple virtues.</p>
