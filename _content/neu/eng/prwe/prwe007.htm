<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE RIVAL GIANTS.</p>
<P><br>
THOSE who have visited the Logan Rock will be familiar with the several groups
which form the Treryn promontory. Treryn Castle, an ancient British fortress,
the Cyclopean walls of which, and its outer earthwork, can still be traced,
was the dwelling of a famous giant and his wife. I have heard it said that he
gave his name to this place, but that is, of course, doubtful. This giant was
chief of a numerous band, and by his daring he held possession, against the
giants of the Mount, of all the lands west of Penzance. Amongst the hosts who
owned allegiance to him, was a remarkable fine young fellow, who had his abode
in a cave, in the pile of rocks upon which the Logan Rock stands. This young
giant grew too fond of the giantess, and it would appear that the lady was not
unfavourably inclined towards him. Of their love passes, however, we know
nothing. Tradition has only told us that the giantess was one day reclining on
the rock still known as the Giant Lady's Chair, while the good old giant was
dosing in the Giant's Chair which stands near it, when the young and wicked
lover stole behind his chief and stabbed him in the belly with a knife.[a] The
giant fell over the rocks to the level ridge below, and there he lay, rapidly
pouring out his life-blood. From this spot the young murderer kicked him into
the sea, ere yet his life was quite extinct, and he perished in the waters.</p>
<P>The guilty pair took possession of Treryn Castle, and, we
are told, lived happily for many years. </p>
<P>[a] Mr Halliwell infers from this that
the story is Saxon. See &quot;Wanderings in the Footsteps of the Giants&quot;</p>
