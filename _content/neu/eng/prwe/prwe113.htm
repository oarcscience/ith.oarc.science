<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SUICIDE'S GHOST.</p>
<P>ON the bleak road between Helston and Wendron
Church-town, at its highest and wildest spot, three roads meet about a
quarter of a mile from the latter place. Here, at &quot;Three Cross,&quot; as the
place is called, years ago, when the Downs being unenclosed, it was more
desolate than it is even now, a poor suicide, named &quot;Tucker,&quot; was buried.
Few liked to pass up Row's Lane, leading there, after nightfall; for
Tucker's shade had more than once been seen. One man, however, valiant in
his cups, on his return from Helston market, cracked his whip, and shouted
lustily, &quot;Arise, Tucker!&quot; as he passed the place. It is said Tucker did
arise, and fixed himself on the saddle behind the man as he rode on
horseback, and accompanied him--how far it is not said. This was often
repeated, until the spirit, becoming angry, refused any more to quit his
disturber, and continued to trouble him, till &quot;Parson Jago&quot; was called in to
use his skill, which was found effectual, in &quot;laying&quot; Tucker's spirit to
rest.</p>
