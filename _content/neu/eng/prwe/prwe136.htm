ST NEOT AND THE FOX.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;One
day the holy hermit was standing in his bath chanting the Psalms, when he
heard the sound of huntsmen approaching.</p>
<P>
Whether the saint feared, ridicule or
ill-treatment, we know not; but certainly he left some psalms unsung that
day, and hastily gathering up his clothes, he fled to his cell.</p>
<P>
In his haste the good man lost his shoe, and a
hungry fox having escaped the hunters, came to the spring to drink. Having
quenched the fever of thirst, and being hungry, he spied the saint's shoe, and
presently ate it. The hermit despatched his servant to look for his shoe; and,
lo, he found the fox cast into a deep sleep, and the thongs of the shoe hanging
out of his vile mouth. Of&nbsp; course the shoe was pulled out of his stomach, and restored to the saint.</p>
