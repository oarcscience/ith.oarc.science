THE CLUB-MOSS.</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
(LYCOPODIUM INUNDATUM.)</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
IF this moss is properly gathered, it is "good against all diseases of
the eyes."</p>
<P>
&nbsp;The gathering is regarded as a
mystery not to be lightly told; and if any man ventures to write the
secret, the virtues of the moss avail him no more. I hope, therefore, my
readers will fully value the sacrifice I make in giving them the formula
by which they may be guided.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;On the third day of the moon --m when the
thin crescent is seen for the first time--show it the knife with which
the moss is to be cut, and repeat,--&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"As Christ heal'd the issue of blood,<br>
Do thou cut, what thou cuttest, for good !"</p>
<P>
At sun-down, having carefully washed the hands, the club-moss is to be
cut kneeling. It is to be carefully wrapped in a white cloth, and
subsequently boiled in some water taken from the spring nearest to its
place of growth. This may be used as a fomenta&#173;tion. Or the club-moss may
be made into an ointment, with butter made from the milk of a new cow.</p>
