<P ALIGN="CENTER">MERLYN'S PROPHECIES.</p>
<P><br>
PROPHECIES by Merlyn are tolerably prevalent in Cornwall. The character of
these may be known by one or two examples --</p>
<P>&quot;Aga syth tyer, war and meyne Merlyn<br>
Ara neb syth Leskey Paul, Penzance hag Newlyn.&quot; </p>
<P>This has been translated--</p>
<P>&quot;There shall land on the stone of Merlyn,<br>
Those who shall burn Paul, Penzance, and Newlyn.&quot;</p>
<P>This prophecy is supposed to have been accomplished when the
Spaniards, in the reign of Elizabeth, landed at Mousehole, a fishing village
in the Mount's Bay. Near the pier at Mousehole is still a rock called
&quot;Merlyn Car,&quot; or &quot;Merlyn's Rock,&quot; and not far from it another, called &quot;the
Spaniard.&quot;</p>
<P>
THE LEVAN STONE.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;This bisected mass of granite has been already noticed in con&#173;nection
with St Levan.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;"When, with panniers astride, <br>
A pack-horse can ride <br>
Through the Levan Stone, <br>
The world will be done."</p>
<P>
THE RAME HEAD AND THE DODMAN.</p>
<P>
Merlyn is said to have pronounced the
following prophecy, standing near St German's Grotto on the shores of Whitsand
Bay:-- </p>
<P>
"When the Rame Head and Dodman meet,<br>
Man and woman will have cause to greet."</p>
