ST NEOT AND THE THIEVES

 When St Neot was abbot, some thieves came by night and stole the oxen
belonging to the farm of the monastery. The weather was most
uncertain,--the seed-time was passing away,--and a fine morning rendered
it imperative that the ploughs should be quickly employed. There were no
oxen. Great was the diffi­culty, and earnest were the abbot's prayers.
In answer to them, the wild stags came in from the forests, and tamely
offered their necks to the yoke. When unyoked in the evening, they
resorted to their favourite pastures, but voluntarily returned each
morning to their work. The report of this event reached the ears of the
thieves. They became penitent, and restored the oxen to the monastery.
Not only so, but they consecrated their days to de­votional exercises.
The oxen being restored, the stags were dis­missed; but they bore for
ever a white ring, like a yoke about their necks, and they held a
charmed life, safe from the shafts of the hunters.
