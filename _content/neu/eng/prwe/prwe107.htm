<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE HAUNTED WIDOWER</p>
<P>A LABOURING man, very shortly after his wife's death,
.sent to a servant girl, living at the time in a small shipping port,
requesting her to come to the inn to him. The girl went, and over a &quot;ha'
pint&quot; she agreed to accept him as her husband.</p>
<P>All went on pleasantly enough for a time. One evening the
man met the girl. He was silent for some time and sorrowful, but at length
he told her his wife had come back.</p>
<P>&quot;What do'st mean?&quot; asked the girl; &quot;have 'e seen hur?&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Naw, I han't seed her.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Why, how do'st knaw it is her then?&quot;</p>
<P>The poor man explained to her, that at night, when in
bed, she would come to the side of it, and &quot;flop&quot; his face; and there was no
mistaking her &quot;flop.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;So you knawed her flop, did 'e?&quot; asked the girl.</p>
<P>&quot;Ay, it couldn't be mistook.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;If she do hunt thee,&quot; said the girl, &quot;she 'II hunt me;
and if she do flop 'e, she 'II flop me,--so it must be off atween us.&quot;</p>
<P>The unfortunate flop of the dead wife prevented the man
from securing a living one.</p>
