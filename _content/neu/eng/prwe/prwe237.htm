<P ALIGN="CENTER">SHAM MAYORS.</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I.--THE MAYOR OF MYLOR.</p>
<P>HERE was a curious custom in the town of Penryn in
Cornwall, which long outlived all modern innovations. On some particular
day in September or October (I forget the exact date), about when the
hazel-nuts are ripe, the festival of nutting-day is kept. The rabble of
the town go into the country to gather nuts returning in the evening with
boughs of hazel in their hands, shouting and making a great noise. In the
meantime the journeymen tailors of the town have proceeded to the
adjoining village of Mylor,. and elected one of their number &quot;Mayor of
Mylor,&quot; taking care the. selection falls on the wittiest. Seated in a
chair shaded with green boughs, and borne on the shoulders of four
stalwart men, the worthy mayor proceeds from his &quot;good town of Mylor&quot; to
his &quot;ancient borough of Penryn,&quot; the van being led by the &quot;bodyguard&quot; of
stout fellows well armed with cudgels,--which they do not fail to use
should' their path be obstructed,--torch-bearers, and two &quot;town
serjeants,&quot; clad in official gowns and cocked hats,, and carrying each a
monstrous cabbage on his shoulder in lieu of a mace. The rear is brought
up by the rabble of the &quot;nutters&quot;. About mid-day a band of music meets
them, and plays them to Penryn, where they are received by the entire
population. The procession proceeds to the town-hall, in front of which
the mayor delivers a speech, declaratory of his intended improvements, &amp;c.
for the coming year, being generally an excellent sarcastic burlesque on
the speeches of parliamentary candidates. The procession then moves on to
each; public-house door, where the mayor, his council, and .officers, are
liberally supplied with liquor; and the speech is repeated with
variations. They then adjourn to the &quot;council-chamber,&quot; in some
public-house, and devote the night to drinking. At night the streets are
filled with people bearing torches, throwing fireballs, and discharging
rockets; and huge bonfires are kindled on the &quot;Green,&quot; and &quot;Old Wall.&quot; The
legal mayor once made an effort to put a stop to this saturnalia, but his
new-made brother issued prompt orders to his body-guards, and the <i>posse
comitatus </i>had to fly.</p>
<P>The popular opinion is, that there is a clause in the
borough charter compelling the legitimate mayor to surrender his power to
the &quot;Mayor of Mylor&quot; on the night in question, and to lend the town
sergeants' paraphernalia to the gentlemen
of the shears.</p>
