<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE BONFIRE TEST</p>
<P>
&nbsp;A BONFIRE is formed of faggots of furze, ferns, and the
like. Men and maidens by locking hands form a circle, and commence a dance
to some wild native song. At length, as the dancers become excited, they
pull each other from side to side across the fire. If they succeed in
treading out the fire without breaking the chain, none of the party will
die during the year. If, however, the ring is broken before the fire is
extinguished, &quot;bad luck to the weak hands,&quot; as my informant said.</p>
