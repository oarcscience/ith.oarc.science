<P ALIGN="CENTER">HOLY WELL AT LITTLE CONAN</p>
<P>ON Palm Sunday the people resorted to the well sacred to
&quot;Our Lady of Nants,&quot; with a cross of palm, and after making the priest a
present, they' were allowed to throw the cross into the well; if it swam the
thrower was to outlive the year, if sank he was not. [a]</p>
