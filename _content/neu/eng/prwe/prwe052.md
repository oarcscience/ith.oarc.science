THE MURYANS' BANK \[a\]

  
The ant is called by the peasantry a Muryan. Believing that they are the
Small People in their state of decay from off the earth, it is deemed
most unlucky to destroy a colony of ants. If you place a oiece of tin in
a bank of Muryans at a certain age of the moon, it will be turned into
silver.

\[a\] *Murrian*, Welsh, "Crig-murrian," the hill of ants.
