<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PENRYN TRAGEDY.</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;News from Penryn, in Cornwall, of a most bloody and
unexampled Murder.&quot;</p>
<P>SUCH was the title of a black-letter pamphlet of
eight pages referred to by Lysons. This curious book does not appear
to be in existence.</p>
<P>Mr Davies Gilbert, who possessed much property in
the parish of Gluvias, was especially interested in the farm of
Bohelland, the place which has been rendered for ever notorious, as
having been the scene of Lillo's tragedy of &quot;Fatal Curiosity.&quot;</p>
<P>From a work entitled &quot;The Reign and Death of King
James of Great Britain,&quot; Mr Gilbert quotes as follows:-</p>
<P>&quot;He had been blessed with ample possessions and
fruitful issue, unhappy only in a younger son, who, taking liberty
from his father's bounty, and with a crew of like condition, that
wearied on land, they went roving to sea, and, in a small vessel
southward, took boot from all they could master. And so increasing
force and wealth, ventured on a Turk's man in the Streights; but by
mischance their own powder fired themselves, and our gallant, trusting
to his skilful swimming, got on shore upon Rhodes, with the best of
his jewels about him; where, offering some to sale to a <i>Jew, </i>
who knew them to be the Governor's of Algier, he was apprehended, and,
as a pirate, sentenced to the galleys among other Christians, whose
miserable slavery made them all studious of freedom, and with wit and
valour took opportunity and means to murder some officers, got on
board of an English ship, and came safe to London; where his misery,
and some skill, made him servant to a surgeon, and sudden preferment
to the East Indies. There, by this means, he got money; with which
returning back, he designed himself for his native county, Cornwall.
And in a small ship from London, sailing to the west, was cast away
upon that coast. But his excellent skill in swimming, and former fate
to<b> </b>boot, brought him safe to shore; where, since his fifteen
years' absence, his father's former fortunes much decayed, now retired
him not far off to a country habitation, in debt and danger.</p>
<P>&quot;His sister he finds married to a mercer, a meaner
snatch than her birth promised. To her, at first, he appears a poor
stranger, but its private reveals himself, and withal what jewels and
gold he had concealed in a bow-case about him; and concluded that the
next day he intended to appear to his parents, and to keep his
disguise till she and her husband should meet, and make their common
joy complete. Being come to his parents, his humble behaviour,
suitable to his suit of clothes, melted the old couple to so much
compassion as to give him covering from the cold season under their
outward roof; and by degrees his travelling tales, told with passion
to the aged people, made him their guest so long by the kitchen fire,
that the husband took leave and went to bed. And soon after his true
stories working compassion in the weaker vessel, she wept, and so did
he<b>; </b>but compassionate of her tears, he comforted her with a
piece of gold, which gave assurance that he deserved a lodging, to
which she brought him; and being in bed, showed her his girdled
wealth, which he said was sufficient to relieve her husband's wants,
and to spare for himself and being very weary, fell fast asleep.</p>
<P>&quot;The wife tempted with the golden bait of what she
had, and eager of enjoying all, awakened her husband with this news,
and her contrivance what to do; and though with horrid apprehensions
he oft refused, yet her puling fondness (Eve's enchantments) moved him
to consent, and rise to be master of all, and both of them to murder
the man, which instantly they did; covering the corpse under the
clothes till opportunity to convey it out of the way.</p>
<P>&quot;The early morning hastens the sister to her
father's house, where she with signs of joy, inquires for a sailor
that should lodge there the last night; the parents slightly denied to
have seen any such, until she told them that he was her brother, her
lost brother; by that assured scar upon his arm, cut with a sword in
his youth, she knew him; and were all resolved this morning to meet
there and be merry.</p>
<P>&quot;The father hastily runs up, finds the mark, and
with horrid regret of this monstrous murder of his own son, with the
same knife cuts his own throat.</p>
<P>&quot;The wife went up to consult with him, where, in a
most strange manner beholding them both in blood, wild and aghast,
with the instrument at hand, readily rips herself up, and perishes on
the same spot.</p>
<P>&quot;The daughter, doubting the delay of their absence,
searches for them all, whom she found out too soon; with the sad sight
of this scene, anti being overcome with horror and amaze of this
deluge of destruction, she sank down and died <b>; </b>the fatal end
of that<b> </b>family. The truth of which was frequently known, and
flew to court in this guise; but the imprinted relation conceals their
names, in favour to some neighbour of repute and kin to that family.
The same sense makes me therein silent also.&quot;--<i>Gilbert,&quot; </i>vol.
ii. p. 100</p>
<P>Mr Harris of Salisbury, in his &quot;Philological
Inquiries,&quot; says of Lillo's tragedy :-</p>
<P>&quot;It is no small praise to this affecting fable that
it so much resembles the 'Oedipus Tyrannus' of Sophocles. In both
tragedies, that which apparently leads to joy, leads in its completion
to misery; both tragedies concur in the horror of their discoveries,
and both in those great outlines of a truly tragic revolution
(according to the nervous sentiment of Lillo himself)--</p>
<P>'The two extremes of life,<br>
The highest happiness the deepest woe<br>
With all the sharp and bitter aggravations<br>
Of such a vast transition.' &quot;</p>
