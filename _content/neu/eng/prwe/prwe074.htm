<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MEN-SCRYFA.</p>
<P><br>
AT the entrance to Penzance rises, rather abruptly, a hill, crowned with a
very remarkable earthwork. It is known as Castle Lesgudzhek, or, the &quot; Castle
of the Bloody Field,&quot; to this day.</p>
<P>Tradition, our only guide, tells us that this castle was
one of the strong places of a British king, in the third or fourth century;
that a rival chieftain, from the eastern part of Danmonium, besieged him. The
defence was long and desperate. The besiegers, wearying of the unsuccessful
toil, retired at length to the plains of Gulval; and that the besieged left
his castle, and gave his enemies battle on the plain which extends from
Penzance to Marazion. The &quot;bloody field&quot; remained in possession of the
chieftain of Lesgudzhek, and the leader of the eastern men was killed near
where he was buried. The Men-Scryfa, or inscribed stone, was raised over his
grave,--its height, nine feet, being the exact height of the defeated warrior
?</p>

is engraven on the block; thus handing to us the name of the unfortunate
warrior, who was probably the son of the hero from whom Gulval draws its name;
and if so, may we not suppose that he was but endeavouring to recover the
possessions which once belonged to his parent.</p>
