<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE HOOPER, OR THE HOOTER, OF SENNEN
COVE.</p>
<P>THIS was supposed to be a spirit which took the form of a
band of misty vapour, stretching across the bay, so opaque that nothing
could be seen through it. It was regarded as a kindly interposition of some
ministering spirit, to warn the fishermen against venturing to sea. This
appearance was always followed, and often suddenly, by a severe storm. It is
seldom or never seen now. One profane old fisherman would not be warned by
the bank of fog. The weather was fine on the shore, and the</p>
<P>waves fell tranquilly on the sands; and this aged sinner,
declaring he would not be made a fool of, persuaded some young men to join
him. They manned a boat, and the aged leader, having with him a
threshing-flail, blasphemously declared that he would drive. the spirit
away; and he vigorously beat the fog with the &quot;threshel&quot;--so the flail is
called.</p>
<P>The boat passed through the fog and went to sea. A severe
storm came on. No one ever saw the boat or the men again; and since that
time the Hooper has been rarely seen.</p>
