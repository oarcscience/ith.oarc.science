<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE TWELFTH CAKE.</p>
<P>THE custom, apparently a very ancient one, of putting
certain, articles into a rich cake, is still preserved in many districts.
Usually, sixpence, a wedding-ring, and a silver thimble are employed. These
are mixed up with the dough, and baked in the cake. At night the cake is
divided. The person who secures the sixpence will not want money for that
year; the one who has the, ring will be the first married; and the possessor
of the thimble will die an old maid.</p>
<P>&quot;Then also every householder,<br>
To his abilitie<br>
Doth make a mighty cake, that may<br>
Suffice his companie:<br>
Herein a pennie doth he put,<br>
Before it come to fire;<br>
This he divides according as<br>
His household doth require,<br>
And every peece distributethAs round about they stand,<br>
Which in their names unto the poor<br>
Is given out of hand.<br>
But who so chanceth on the peece<br>
Wherein the money lies,<br>
Is counted king amongst them all;<br>
And is with shoutes and cries<br>
Exalted to the heavens up.&quot;<br>
