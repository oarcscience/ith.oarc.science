<P ALIGN="CENTER">DORCAS, THE SPIRIT OF POLBREEN MINE.</p>
<P>POLBREEN MINE is situated at the foot of the hill known as
St Agnes Becon. In one of the small cottages which immediately adjoins the
mine once lived a woman called Dorcas.</p>
<P>Beyond this we know little of her life; but we are
concerned-chiefly with her death, which, we are told, was suicidal.</p>
<P>From some cause, which is not related, Dorcas grew weary of
life, and one unholy night she left her house and flung herself into one of
the deep shafts of Polbreen Mine, at the bottom of which her dead and broken
body was discovered. The remnant of humanity was brought to the surface; and
after the laws of the time with regard to suicides had been fulfilled, the
body of Dorcas was buried.</p>
<P>Her presence, however, still remained in the mine. She
appears, ordinarily to take a malicious delight in tormenting the
industrious miner, calling him by name, and alluring him from his tasks.
This was carried on by her to such an extent, that when a &quot;tributer&quot; had
made a poor month, he was asked if he had &quot;been chasing Dorcas.&quot; [a]</p>
<P>Dorcas was usually only a voice. It has been said by some
that they have seen her in the mine, but this is doubted by the miners
generally, who refer the spectral appearance to the fears of their
&quot;comrade.&quot;</p>
<P>But it is stated as an incontrovertible fact, that more than
one man who has met the spirit in the levels of the mine has had his clothes
torn off his back; whether in anger or in sport, is not clearly made out. On
one occasion, and on one occasion only, Dorcas appears to have acted kindly.
Two miners, who for distinction's sake we will call Martin and Jacky, were
at work in their end, and at the time busily at work &quot;beating the borer.&quot;</p>
<P>The name of Jacky was distinctly uttered between the blows.
He stopped and listened--all was still. They proceeded with their task a
blow on the iron rod.--&quot; Jacky.&quot; Another blow. --</p>
<P>&quot;Jacky.&quot; They pause--all is silent. &quot;Well, thee wert
called, Jacky,&quot; said Martin, &quot;go and see.&quot;</p>
<P>Jacky was, however, either afraid, or he thought himself the
fool of his senses.</p>
<P>Work was resumed, and &quot;Jacky ! Jacky ! Jacky !&quot; was called
more vehemently and distinctly than before.</p>
<P>Jacky threw down his heavy hammer, and went from his
companion, resolved to satisfy himself as to the caller.</p>
<P>He had not proceeded many yards from the spot On which he
had been standing at work, when a mass of rock fell from the roof of the
level, weighing many tons, which would have crushed him to death. Martin had
been stooping, holding the borer, and a projecting corner of rock just above
him turned off the falling mass. He was securely enclosed, and they had to
dig him out, but he escaped without injury. Jacky declared to his dying day
that he owed his life to Dorcas.</p>
<P>Although Dorcas's shaft remains a part of Polbreen Mine, I
am informed by the present agent that her presence has departed.</p>
<P>[a] A tributer is a man who agrees
with the adventurers in a mine to receive a certain share of the profits on
the ore raised by him in lieu of wages. This account is settled wonthly or
bi-monthly, which will explain the phrase a 'poor month.&quot;</p>
