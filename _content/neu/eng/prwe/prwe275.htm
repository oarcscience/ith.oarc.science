<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE ROBIN AND THE WREN</p>
<P>
&nbsp;&quot;THOSE who kill a robin or a wran,<br>
Will never prosper, boy or man.&quot;</p>
<P>This feeling is deeply impressed on every young mind;
there are few, therefore, who would injure either of those birds.</p>
<P>I remember that a boy in Redruth killed a robin: the dead
robin was tied round his neck, and he was marched by the other boys
through the town, all of them singing the above lines.</p>
