<P ALIGN="CENTER">PETER THE DEVIL.</p>
<P>THE church at Altarnun is said to have been built from the
remains of an ancient nunnery which had been founded in the early days of
Christianity by the saint to whom it was dedicated.</p>
<P>There was a peculiar sanctity about all that surrounded
this little church and its holy well, and few were unfaithful enough to scoff
at any of the holy traditions of the sacred place.</p>
<P>About the time of Charles II., an under-clerk or deacon of
this church was called Peter, and he is said to have been a man of exceedingly
bad character. He scoffed at holy things, and--unless he was belied--he made
use of his position for merely temporal benefit, and was not remarkable for
his honesty. He was, moreover, the terror of the neighbourhood. Common report
insisting on it that Peter had been known to disentomb the dead, whether for
the purpose of stealing rings and other trinkets which may have been buried,
as some said, or for the purpose of renewing his youth, as others suggested,
by mysterious contact with the dead, was not clearly made out. He was
invariably called Peter Jowle, or Joule--that is, Peter the Devil. At the age
of a hundred he was a gray-headed, toothless man; but then, by some diabolical
incantation, he is said to have caused new black hairs to spring forth amongst
those which were white with age, and then also new teeth grew in his jaws.
Peter is said to have, died when he was more than a hundred and fifty years
old.</p>
