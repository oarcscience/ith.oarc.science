<P ALIGN="CENTER">ROMANCES OF FIRE WORSHIP.</p>
"Safely hid<BR>
Beneath the purple pall of sacrifice<BR>
Did sleep our holy fire, nor saw the air,<BR>
Till to that pass we came, where whilom Brute<BR>
Planted his five hoar altars. To our rites<BR>
Then swift we hasted, and in one short moment<BR>
The rocky piles were clothed with livid flame."<BR>
Caractacus- Wm. MASON, M.A.
 <P ALIGN="CENTER">An angel who at last in sight<br>
Of both my parents all in flames ascended<br>
From off the altar, where an offering burn'd,<br>
As in a fiery column charioting<br>
His god-like presence.&quot;<br>
-- Samson Agonistes <br>
-- MILTON.</p>
<P>IT would not be profitable to pursue the inquiry into the
value of the numerous hypotheses which have been from time to time raised in
support of the assertion that a system of Fire Worship prevailed amongst the
Britons of old Cornwall.</p>
<P>There can be no doubt but that the writings of Borlase, and
other earnest thinkers of his class, have done much to perpetuate the belief
in the existence of a Druidical priesthood in Cornwall, who had their altars
on the hills,--who made the huge piles of granite rocks the instruments of
their worship,--and who availed themselves of the hollows formed in those
rocks by nature, to procure the unpolluted waters from heaven, with which to
wash away sins.</p>
<P>The antiquary has too frequently placed himself in the
unfortunate position of Jonathan Oldbuck amidst the ancient fortifications at
the Kaim of Kinprunes, when he was so rudely checked in his theory by Edie
Ochiltree, who would insist on it that he did &quot;mind the biggin' o' 't.&quot; But
the modern historian and philosopher has gone as far wrong in the contrary
direction. The antiquaries formerly insisted that all the natural basins
formed in the granite rocks were of Druidic origin, and all the Logan stones
the result of Druid labours. The geologists and historians now declare them,
one and all, to be the result of disintegration, produced by ordinary
atmospheric causes. Both are, I persume to think, wrong. I am quite satisfied
that I can point to rock-basins upon which the hands of man have been busy,
and to Logan stones in which he has, for his own purposes, aided nature.</p>
<P>In the Sacrificing Rock on Carn Brae are a series of
hollows so deeply cut, and so entirely unlike anything seen on any of the
other rocks on that remarkable hill, although ordinary rock-basins are
numerous, that I am disposed to believe in the tradition which gives it its
name. On the Main or Men Rock in Constantine, I see, in like manner, evidences
of the works of man, side by side with those of nature. The disintegration
produced by the accumulation of water, at first in small quantities in a
little hollow on the face of a rock, is a curious process. The first action is
the separation of a few particles, or small crystals, of quartz or mica. These
repose beneath the small deposit of water, until, by the beating of the rains
and the action of the winds, they are made to serve as grinding materials, and
carry on the work of weathering. The basins thus formed have a regular
curvature, which does not belong to those deeper basins to which I have
referred. The question, however, before us is, Have we any evidences,
traditional or otherwise, which go to support the belief that the Phoenicians,
or any other people, introduced the worship of fire into this country?</p>
<P>The influences of education, and the zeal with which
religious teachers have penetrated into the remotest districts and taught the
truth, have banished nearly every relic of this ancient idolatry. But still
amidst the dead ashes a faint spark occasionally appears, to tell us that at
one time our forefathers did use the rocks as altars, on which they kindled
sacrificial fires; and that they had their periods of solemn feast, when every
hill blazed with the emblem of life and dissolution. A few examples of these
pale sparks will not be without value.</p>
