<P ALIGN="CENTER">CRYING THE NECK.</p>
<P>OWING to the uncertain character of the climate of
Cornwall, the farmers have adopted the plan of gathering the sheaves of
wheat, as speedily as possible, into &quot;arishmows.&quot; These are solid cones from
ten to twelve feet high, the heads of the stalks turned inwards, and the
whole capped with a sheaf of corn inverted. Whence the term, I know not; but
&quot;arish&quot; is commonly applied to a field of corn recently cut, as, &quot;Turn the
geese in upon the 'arish' &quot;-- that is, the short stubble left in the ground.</p>
<P>After the wheat is all cut on most farms in Cornwall and
Devon, the harvest people have a custom of &quot; crying the neck.&quot; I believe
that this practice is seldom omitted on any large farm in these counties. It
is done in this way. An old man, or some one else well acquainted with the
ceremonies used on the occasion (when the labourers are reaping the last
field of wheat), goes round to the shocks and sheaves, arid picks out a
little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this bundle he ties up very
neat and trim, and plaits and arranges the straws very tastefully. This is
called &quot;the neck&quot; of wheat, or wheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and
the pitcher once more circulated, the reapers, binders, and the women stand
round in a circle. The person with &quot;the neck&quot; stands in the centre, grasping
it with both his hands. He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and
all the men forming the ring take off their hats, stooping and holding them
with both hands towards the ground. They then all begin at once, in a very
pro-longed and harmonious tone, to cry, &quot;The neck !&quot; at the same time slowly
raising themselves upright, and elevating their arms and hats above their
heads; the person with the neck also raising it on high. This is done three
times. They then change their cry to &quot;We yen ! we yen !&quot; which they sound in
the same prolonged and slow manner as before, with singular harmony and
effect, three times. This last cry is accompanied by the same movements of
the body and arms as in crying &quot;the neck.&quot; I know nothing of vocal music,
but I think I may convey some idea of the sound by giving you the following
notes in gamut --</p>

<P>Let these notes be played on a flute with perfect
crescendoes and diminuendoes, and perhaps some notion of this wild-sounding
cry may be formed. Well, after this they all burst out into a kind of loud,
joyous laugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering about,
and perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets &quot;the neck,&quot; and runs as
hard as he can down to the farmhouse, 'where the dairy-maid, or one of the
young female domestics, stands at the door prepared with a pail of water. If
he who holds &quot;the neck&quot; can manage to get into the house in any way unseen,
or openly by any other way than the door at which the girl stands with the
pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her; but, if otherwise he is
regularly soused with the contents of the bucket. I think this practice is
beginning to decline of late, and many farmers and their men do not care
about keeping up this old custom. The object of crying &quot;the neck&quot; is to give
notice to the surrounding country of the end of the harvest, and the meaning
of&quot; we yen&quot; is &quot;we have ended.&quot; It may probably mean &quot;we end,&quot; which the
uncouth and provincial pronunciation has corrupted into &quot;we yen.&quot; The &quot;neck&quot;
is generally hung up in the farmhouse, where it often remains for three or
four years.</p>
