<P ALIGN="CENTER">SNAKES AVOID THE ASH-TREE.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;IT is said that no kind of snake is ever found near the
&quot;ashen-tree,&quot; and that a branch of the ash-tree will prevent a snake from
coming near a person.</p>
<P>A child who was in the habit of receiving its portion of
bread and milk at the cottage door, was found to be in the habit of
sharing its food with one of the poisonous adders. The reptile came
regularly every morning, and the child, pleased with the beauty of his
companion, encouraged the visits. The babe and adder were close friends.</p>
<P>Eventually this became known to the mother, and, finding
it to be a matter of difficulty to keep the snake from the child whenever
it was left alone,--and she was frequently, being a labourer in the fields,
compelled to leave her child to shift for itself,--she adopted the
precaution of binding an &quot;ashen-twig&quot; about its body.</p>
<P>The adder no longer came near the child; but from that day
forward the child~ pined, and eventually died, as all around said, through
grief at having lost the companion by whom it had been fascinated.</p>
