<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE HAG'S BED NEAR FERMOY.</p>
<P>&quot;NEAR Fermoy is a very peculiar variety of these early
structures, being en oblong building constructed with large blocks of
limestone of the locality. It contains an internal chamber, from twenty to
thirty feet long, five feet wide, and at the present time about four feet
high; the side walls are near five feet thick, constructed with two rows of
upright stones on edge, and the interior is filled with smaller stones,
forming a wall; the front has only a row of thin upright stones, but fitting
nearly close together; the covering stones rest on rude horizontal stones,
which are placed on the wall before described, and which would appear to
have been of insufficient height, and on those are three large covering
stones, one of which is about eighteen feet long.&quot; [a]</p>
