<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE NORTH SIDE OF A CHURCH</p>
<P>I HAVE been favoured with the following remarks
on this subject by the Rev. J. C. Atkinson, of Danby, Grosmont :-</p>
<P>I translate the following from Hylten Cuvalliecs'
<i>W&#228;rend och Wirdurne</i>, pp. 287, 288.</p>
<P>&quot;Inasmuch as all light and all vigour springs from
the sun, our Swedish forefathers always made their prayers with their
faces turned towards that luminary. When any spell or charm in
connection with an 'earth-fast stone' is practised, even in the present
day, for the removal of sickness, the patient invariably turns his face
towards the east, or the sun. When a child is to be carried to church to
be baptized, th W&#228;rend usage is for the godmother first to make he
morning prayer, face towards the east, and then ask the parents three
several times what the child's name is to be. The dead are invariably
interred with their feet lying eastward, so as to have their faces
turned towards the rising sun. <i>Fr&#229;nsols</i>, or with or in a northerly
direction, is, on the other hand, according to an ancient popular idea,
<i>the home of the evil spirits. The Old Northern Hell was placed far away
in the North</i>. When any one desires to remove or break any witch spell,
or the like, by means of 'reading ' (or charms), it is a matter
particularly observed that the stone (<i>i.e</i>., an 'earth-fast' one), is
sought to the northward of the house. In like, manner also the 'bearing
tree'</p>
<P>(any tree which produces fruit, or quasi fruit,
apples, pears, &amp;c., <i>rowan tree</i>, especially, and white thorn herbs), or
the shrew mouse, by means of which it is hoped to remedy an evil spell,
must be met with in a northerly direction from the patient's home. Nay,
if one wants to charm away sickness over (or into) a running stream, it
must always be one which runs northwards. On the self same grounds it
has ever been the practice of the people of the W&#228;rend district, even
down to the present time, not. to bury their dead fr&#229;nsols--or to the
northward--of the church. In that part of the churchyard the contemned
<i>fr&#228;mlings h&#246;gen</i> (strangers' burial, place) always has its site, and in
it are buried malefactors, friendless wretches, and utter strangers. A
very old idea, in like manner connects the north side of the church with
suicides' graves,&quot; &amp;c.</p>
