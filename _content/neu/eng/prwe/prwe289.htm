<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CROAKING OF THE RAVEN</p>
<P>
&nbsp;THERE is a common feeling that the croaking of a raven over
the house bodes evil to some member of the family. The following incident,
given to me by a really intelligent man, illustrates the feeling : [a]</p>
<P>&quot;One day our family were much annoyed by the continued
croaking of a raven over our house. Some of us believed it to be a token;
others derided the idea; but one good lady, our next-door neighbour, said,
'Just mark the day, and see if something does not come of it.' The day and
hour were carefully noted. Months passed away, and unbelievers were loud
in their boastings and inquiries after the token.</p>
<P>&quot;The fifth month arrived, and with it a black-edged letter
from Australia, announcing the death of one of the members of the family
in that country. On comparing the dates of the death and the raven's
croak, they were found to have occurred on the same day.&quot;</p>
