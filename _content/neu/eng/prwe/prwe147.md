THE WELL OF ST KEYNE.

ST KEYNE came to this well about five hundred years before the Norman
Conquest, and imparted a strange virtue to its waters--namely, that
whichever of a newly-married couple should first drink thereof, was to
enjoy the sweetness of domestic sovereignty ever after.

Situated in a thickly-wooded district, the well of St Keyne presents a
singularly picturesque appearance. "Four trees of divers kinds" grow
over the well, imparting a delightful shade, and its clear waters spread
an emerald luxuriance around. Once, and once only, have I paid a visit
to this sacred spot. Then and there I found a lady drinking of the
waters from her thimble, and eagerly contending with her husband that
the right to rule was hers. The man, however, mildly insisted upon it
that he had had the first drink, as he had rushed before his wife, and
dipping his fingers into the water had sucked them. This the lady
contended was not drinking, and she, I have no doubt, through life had
the best of the argument.

Tonkin says, in his "History of Cornwall," "Did it retain this wondrous
quality, as it does to this day the shape, I believe there would be to
it a greater resort of both sexes than either to Bath or Tunbridge; for
who would not be fond of attaining this longed for sovereignty ?" He
then adds, "Since the writing of this, the. trees were blown down by a
violent storm, and in their place Mr Rashleigh, in whose land it is, has
planted two oaks, an ash, and an elm, which thrive well; but the
wonderful arch is destroyed." The author can add to this that (as he
supposes, owing to the alteration made in the trees) the sovereign
virtues of the waters have perished.

Southey's ballad will be remembered by most readers :--

"A well there is in the west country,  
And a clearer one never was seen;  
There is not a wife in the west country  
But has heard of the Well of St Keyne.

"An oak and an elm-tree stand beside,  
And behind doth an ash-tree grow,  
And a willow from the bank above  
Droops to the water below."

It has been already stated that, sitting in St Michael's Chair, on the
tower of the church of St Michael's Mount, has the same virtue as the
waters of this well; and that this remarkable power was the gift of the
same St Keyne who imparted such wonderful properties to this well.
