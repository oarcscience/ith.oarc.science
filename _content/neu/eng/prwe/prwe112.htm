<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SUICIDE'S SPEARMAN.</p>
<P>A FAMILY of the name of Spearman has lived in Cornwall
for many ages, their native centre having been somewhere between Ludgvan and
St Ives.</p>
<P>Years long ago, an unfortunate man, weary of life,
destroyed himself; and the rude laws of a remote age, carrying out, as they
thought, human punishments even after death, decreed that the body should be
buried at the four cross-roads, and quicklime poured on the corpse.</p>
<P>Superstition stepped in, and somewhat changed the order
of burial. To prevent the dead man from &quot;walking,&quot; and becoming a terror to
all his neighbours, the coffin was to be turned upside down, and a spear was
to be driven through it and the body, so as to pin it to the ground.</p>
<P>It was with some difficulty that a man could be found to
perform this task. At length, however, a blacksmith undertook it. He made
the spear; and after the coffin was properly placed, he drove his
spear-headed iron bar through it. From that day he was called &quot;the
spearman,&quot; and his descendants have never lost the name.</p>
<P>In making a new road not many years since, the coffin and
spear were found, and removed. From that time several old men and women have
declared that the self-murderer &quot;walks the earth.&quot;</p>
