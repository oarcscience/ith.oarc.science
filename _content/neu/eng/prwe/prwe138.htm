ST NEOT AND THE THIEVES</p>
<P>
&nbsp;When St Neot was abbot, some thieves came by night and stole the oxen
belonging to the farm of the monastery. The weather was most uncertain,--the
seed-time was passing away,--and a fine morning rendered it imperative that
the ploughs should be quickly employed. There were no oxen. Great was the
diffi&#173;culty, and earnest were the abbot's prayers. In answer to them, the wild
stags came in from the forests, and tamely offered their necks to the yoke.
When unyoked in the evening, they resorted to their favourite pastures, but
voluntarily returned each morning to their work. The report of this event
reached the ears of the thieves. They became penitent, and restored the oxen
to the monastery. Not only so, but they consecrated their days to de&#173;votional
exercises. The oxen being restored, the stags were dis&#173;missed; but they bore
for ever a white ring, like a yoke about their necks, and they held a charmed
life, safe from the shafts of the hunters.</p>
