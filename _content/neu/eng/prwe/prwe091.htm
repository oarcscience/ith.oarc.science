<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SANDS AT LELANT AND PHILLACK.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;<br>
THERE is a tradition that Lelant and Phillack towns were all meadow
land, and that the whole was covered with sand in a single night. Also that
the low tract of land extended on both sides of Hayle far beyond the present
bar, so that the sea has swallowed up some hundreds of acres. The people say
that the sight of the ancient church and village of Lelant was somewhere
seaward of the Black Rock;--the ancient burial-ground has been long washed
away,--and that human teeth are still frequently found on the shore after a
great <i>undertoe</i>, that takes the sand out to sea. Many circumstances seem
to confirm the probability of the tradition. The sand was drifting inland at
such a rate before the reed-like plant called by the present inhabitants the
<i>spire</i> was planted, that the whole of the land about the village would
have been rendered worthless ere this, but for the stability given to it. The
land from which the sand has been cleared, on the sea side of the church, has
evidently been ploughed, as the furrows are quite apparent between the ridges.
They say that there was a market held in Lelant when St Ives was scarcely a
village. Lelant being the mother church, would seem to prove this. One can
easily understand how a large tract of land of the nature of that under Lelant
sand-hills would be washed away in a comparatively short time, as the soil at
the low-water level is a many clay. This is constantly being washed down by
high tides, and carried away by the undercurrent, as it contains no stone to
form a pebbly beach, and therefore there is nothing left to protect the shore.</p>
