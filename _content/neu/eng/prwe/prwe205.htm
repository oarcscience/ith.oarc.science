<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LADY WITH THE LANTERN.</p>
<P>THE night was dark and the wind high. The heavy waves I
rolled round the point of &quot;the Island&quot; into St Ives Bay, as Atlantic waves
only can roll. Everything bespoke a storm of no ordinary character. There
were no ships in the bay--not a fishing-boat was afloat. The few small
trading vessels had run into Hayle for shelter, or had nestled themselves
within that very unquiet resting-place, St Ives pier. The fishing-boats were
all high and dry on the sands.</p>
<P>Moving over the rocks which run out into the sea from the
eastern side of &quot;the Island,&quot; was seen a light. It passed over the most
rugged ridges, formed by the intrusive Greenstone masses, and over the sharp
edges of the upturned slate-rocks with apparent ease. Forth and back--to
and from--wandered the light.</p>
<P>&quot;Ha !&quot; said an old sailor with a sigh, as he looked out over
the sea; &quot;a sad night ! a sad night ! The Lady and the Lantern is out.,'</p>
<P>&quot;The Lady and the Lantern,&quot; repeated I; &quot;what do you mean ?&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;The light out yonder&quot;--&quot;Is from the lantern of some
fisherman looking for something he has lost,&quot; interrupted I.</p>
<P>&quot;Never a fisherman nor a 'salt' either would venture there
tonight,&quot; said the sailor.</p>
<P>&quot;What is it, then ?&quot; I curiously inquired.</p>
<P>&quot;Ha'ast never heard of the Lady and the Lantern ?&quot; asked a
woman who was standing by.</p>
<P>&quot;Never.&quot;</p>
<P>Without any preface, she began at once to enlighten me. I
am compelled, however, to reduce her rambling story to something like order,
and to make her long-drawn tale as concise as possible.</p>
<P>In the year--there were many wrecks around the coast. It
was a melancholy time. For more than a month there had been a succession of
storms, each one more severe than the preceding one. At length, one evening,
just about dusk, a large ship came suddenly out of the mist. Her position,
it was at once discovered,</p>
<P>equally by those on board, and by the people on the
shore, was perilous beyond hope. The sailors, as soon as they saw how near
they were to the shore, made every effort to save the ship, and then to
prepare for saving themselves. The tempest raged with such fury from the
west, that the ship parted her anchors at the moment her strain came upon
them, and she swang round,--her only sail flying into ribbons in the gale--
rushing, as it were, eagerly upon her fate. Presently she struck violently
upon a sunken rock, and her masts went by the board, the waves 'sweeping
over her, and clearing her decks. Many perished at once, and, as each
successive wave urged her onward, others of the hardy and daring seamen were
swept into the angry sea.</p>
<P>Notwithstanding the severity of the storm, a boat was
manned by the St Ives fishermen, and launched from within the pier. Their
perfect knowledge of their work enabled them, by the efforts of willing
hearts, anxiously desiring to succour the distressed, to round the
pier-head, and to row towards the ship.</p>
<P>These fishermen brought their boat near to the ship. It
was impossible to get close to her, and they called to the sailors on board
to throw them ropes. This they were enabled to do, and some two or three of
the sailors lowered themselves by their aid, and were hauled into the boat.</p>
<P>Then a group appeared on the deck, surrounding and
supporting a lady, who held a child in her arms. They were imploring her to
give her charge into the strong arms of a man ere they endeavoured to pass
her from the ship to the boat.</p>
<P>The lady could not be prevailed on to part with the
infant. The ship was fast breaking up, not a moment could be lost. So the
lady, holding her child, was lowered into the sea, and eagerly the fishermen
drew her through the waves towards the boat.</p>
<P>In her passage the lady had fainted, and she was taken
into the boat without the infant. The child had fallen from her arms, and
was lost in the boiling waters.</p>
<P>Many of the crew were saved by these adventurous men, and
taken safely into St Ives. Before morning the shore was strewed with
fragments of wreck, and the mighty ship had disappeared.</p>
<P>Life returned to the lady; but, finding that her child
was gone, it returned without hope, and she speedily closed her eyes in
death. In the churchyard they buried her; but, shortly after her burial, a
lady was seen to pass over the wall of the churchyard, on to the beach, and
walk towards the Island. There she spent hours amidst the rocks, looking for
her child, and not finding it, she would sigh deeply and return to her
grave. When the nights were tempestuous or very dark, she carried a lantern;
but on fine nights she made her search without a light. The Lady and the
Lantern have ever been regarded as predictors of disaster on this shore.</p>
<P><br>
May not the Lady Sibella, or Sibbets, mentioned by Mr Blight as passing from
the shore to a rock off Morva, be but another version of this story ?</p>
