<P ALIGN="CENTER">TREWA, OR TREWE, THE HOME OF WITCHES.</p>
<P>AS we walk from Nancledrea Bottoms towards Zennor we pass
Trewa (pronounced <i>Truee), </i>which is said to have been the place where
at Midsummer all the witches of the west met. Here are the remains of very
ancient tin stream works, and these, I<i> </i>was informed, &quot;were the
remains of bals which had been worked before the deluge; there was nothing
so old anywhere else in Cornwall.&quot; Around us, on the hill-sides and up the
bottoms~ huge boulders of granite are most fantastically scattered. All
these rocks sprang from the ground at the call of the giants. At Embla Green
we still see the ruins of the Giant's House, but all we know of this Titan
is that he was the king. On one side we have the &quot;Giant's Well,&quot; and not far
off the &quot;Druid's Well,&quot; and a little before us is Zennor coit or cromlech.</p>
<P>From this point the scenery is of the wildest
description. The granite cairns are spread around in every direction, and
many of those masses are so strangely fashioned by the atmospheric
influences ever acting on them, that fancy can readily fashion them into
tombs and temples. Rock basins abound on these hills, and of ruined
cromlechs there are many. Whatever the local historians may say, local
traditions assure us that on Midsummer Eve all the witches in Penwith
gathered here, and that they lit fires on every cromlech, and in every rock
basin, until the' hills were alive with flame, and renewed their vows to the
evil ones from whom they derived their power. Hence, to this day this place
is called Burn Downs. Amidst these rock masses there was one pile remarkable
amidst all the others for its size, and--being formed of cubical masses--
for its square character. This was known as the Witches' Rock, and here it
was said they assembled at midnight to carry on their wicked deeds. This
rock has been removed, and with it the witches have died; the last real
witch in Zennor having passed away, as I have been told, about thirty years
since, and with her, some say, the fairies fled. I have, however, many
reasons for believing that our little friends have still a few 'haunts in
this locality. There is but one reason why we should regret the
disappearance of the Witches' Rock. <i>Any one touching this rock nine times
at midnight was insured against bad luck.</p>
