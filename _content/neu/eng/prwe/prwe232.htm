<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;ST GEORGE&quot;--THE CHRISTMAS PLAYS.</p>
<P>THE Christmas play is a very ancient institution in
Cornwall. At one time religious subjects were chosen, but those gave way to
romantic plays. The arrangements were tolerably complete, and sometimes a
considerable amount of dramatic skill was displayed.</p>
<P>&quot;St George, and the other tragic performers, are dressed
out some. what in the style of morris-dancers, in their shirt sleeves and
white trousers, much decorated with riblbons and handkerchiefs, each carryg
a drawn sword in his hand, if they can be procured, otherwise a cudgel. They
wear high caps of pasteboard, adorned with beads, small pieces of
looking-glass, coloured paper, &amp;c. ; several long strips of pith generally
hang down from the top, with small pieces of different coloured cloth strung
on them; the whole has a very smart effect.</p>
<P>Father Christmas is personified in a grotesque manner, as
an ancient man wearing a large mask and wig, and a huge club, wherewith he
keeps the bystanders in order.</p>
<P>The Doctor, who is generally the merryandrew of the piece,
is dressed in any ridiculous way, with a wig, three-cornered hat, and
painted face.</p>
<P>The other comic characters are dressed according to fancy.
</p>
<P>The female, where there is one, is usually in the dress worn
half a century ago.</p>
<P>The hobbyhorse, which is a character sometimes introduced,
wears a representation of a horse's hide.</p>
<P>Beside the regular drama of &quot;St George,&quot; many parties of
mummers go about in fancy dresses of every sort, most commonly the males in
female attire, and vice versa.</p>
<P>BATTLE OF ST GEORGE</p>
<P>[One of the party steps in, crying out, -</p>
<P>Room, a room, brave gallants, room !<br>
Within this court<br>
I do resort<br>
To show some sport<br>
And pastime,<br>
Gentlemen and ladies, in the Christmas time.</p>
<P>[After this note of preparation, Old Father Christmas
capers into the room, saying -</p>
<P>Here comes I, Old Father Christmas;<br>
Welcome or welcome not,<br>
I hope Old Father Christmas<br>
Will never be forgot.<br>
I was born in a rocky country, where there was no wood to make me cradle; I
was rocked in a stouring bowl, which made me round shouldered then, and I am
round shouldered still.</p>
<P>[He then frisks about the room, until he thinks he has
sufficiently amused the spectators, when he makes his exit, with this speech
-</p>
<P>Who went to the orchard to steal apples to make
gooseberry pies against Christmas ?</p>
<P>[These prose speeches, you may suppose, depend much upon
the imagination of the actor.</p>
<P><i>Enter Turkish Knight</i></p>
<P>Here comes I, a Turkish Knight,<br>
Come from the Turkish land to fight;<br>
And if St George do meet me here,<br>
I'll try his courage without fear.</p>
<P><i>Enter St George</i></p>
<P>Here comes I, St George,<br>
That worthy champion bold;<br>
And, with my sword and spear,<br>
I won three crowns of gold.<br>
I fought the dragon bold,<br>
And brought him to the slaughter;<br>
By that I gain'd fair Sabra,<br>
To the King of Egypt's daughter.</p>
<P>T.K. St George, I pray, be not too bold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If thy blood is hot, I'll soon make
it cold<br>
St. G Thou Turkish knight, I pray forbear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll make thee dread my sword and
spear.</p>
<P>[They fight until the Turkish knight falls</p>
<P>St. G I have a little bottle, which goes by the name
Elicumpane;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the man is alive, let him rise and
fight again.</p>
<P>[The Knight here rises on one knee, and endeavours to
continue the fight, but is again struck down</p>
<P>T.K. Oh pardon me, St George; oh pardon me, I crave;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh pardon me this once, and I will be
thy slave.<br>
St. G I'll never pardon a Turkish knight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore arise and try thy might.</p>
<P>[The knight gets up, and they fight, till the knight
receives a heavy blow, and then drops on the ground as dead.</p>
<P>St G Is there a doctor to be found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cure a deep and deadly wound ?</p>
<P><i>Enter Doctor</i></p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yes, there
is a doctor to be found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cure a deep and deadly wound.</p>
<P>St. G What can you cure ?<br>
Doctor I can cure the itch, the palsy, and gout;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the devil's in him. I'll pull him
out.</p>
<P>[The doctor here performs the cure with sundry grimaces,
and St George and the knight again fight, when the latter is knocked down,
and left for dead.</p>
<P>[Then another performer enters, and on seeing the dead
body, says, -</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashes to
ashes, dust to dust;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Uncle Tom Pearce won't have him,
Aunt Molly must.</p>
<P>[The hobby horse here capers in, and takes off the body.</p>
<P><i>Enter Old Squire</i></p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here comes I,
old, Old Squire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As black as any friar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As ragged as a colt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To leave fine clothes for malt.</p>
<P><i>Enter Hub Bub</i></p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here comes I,
old Hub Bub Bub Bub;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon my shoulders I carries a club,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in my hand a frying pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So am I not a valient man ?</p>
<P>[These characters serve as a sort of burlesque on St
George and the other hero, and may be regarded in the light of an
anti-masque</p>
<P><i>Enter the Box-holder</i></p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here comes I,
great head and little wit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put your hand in your pocket, and
give what you think fit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlemen and ladies sitting down at
your ease,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put your hand in your pocket, and
give me what you please.</p>
<h3><i>St </i>
<i>G.</i> Gentlemen and
ladies, the sport is almost ended;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come pay to the box, it is highly
commended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The box it would speak, if it had but
a tongue;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come throw in your money, and think
it no wrong.</h3>
<h3>The characters now
generally finish with a dance, or sometimes a song or two is introduced. In
some of the performances, two or three other tragic heroes are brought
forward, as the King of Egypt and his son, &amp;c.; but they are all of them
much in the style of that I have just described, varying somewhat in length
and number of characters."-- The <i>Every-Day Book.</i></h3>
<h3>Of the Cornish
mystery plays which were once acted in the famous "Rounds," it is not
necessary, in this place, to say any&#173;thing. The translations by Mr Norris
preserve their characteristics, which indeed differ in few respects from the
mystery plays of other parts.</h3>
<h3>The "Perran Round"
is fortunately preserved by the proprietor in its original state. Every one
must regret the indifference of the wealthy inhabitants of <i>St </i>Just to
their "Round," which is now a wretched ruin.</h3>
