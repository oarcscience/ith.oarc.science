<P ALIGN="CENTER">CHURCHES BUILT IN PERFORMANCE OF VOWS.</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<b>&nbsp;</b>THERE are several churches which, tradition tells
us, owe their origin to vows made by terrified men that they would, if
relieved from their dangers, build a temple to God.</p>
<P>Amongst these may be named Brent Tor, thus spoken of
by Mr Bray :-- </p>
<P>&quot;The church of Brent Tor is dedicated to St Michael.
And there is a tradition among the vulgar that its foundation was
originally laid at the foot of the hill <b>; </b>but that the enemy
of all angels, the Prince of Darkness, removed the stones by night
from the base to the summit,--probably to he nearer his own
dominion, the air,--but that, immediately on the church's being
dedicated to St Michael, the patron of the edifice hurled upon the
devil such an enormous mass of rock that he never afterwards
ventured to approach <b>it. </b>Others tell us that <b>it </b>was
erected by a wealthy merchant, who vowed, in the midst of a
tremendous storm at sea (possibly addressing him. self to his
patron, St Michael, that if he escaped, he would built a church on
the first land he descried.&quot; [a]</p>
<P>Brent Tor is a very remarkable hill, and can be
seen far off at sea. This may possibly lend some support to the latter
tradition.</p>
<P>St Anthony, in Kerrier, is likewise stated to be
the consequence of a vow. Soon after the Conquest, as some persons of
rank and fortune were coming to England from Normandy, they were
overtaken by a violent storm, from which they expected immediate
destruction. In the midst of their distress, they directed their
prayers to St Anthony, and laid themselves under a solemn vow to erect
a church to his memory, if he would save them from shipwreck; and that
this church should be erected on the very spot where they should first
get on shore. Driven by the tempest, they were conducted, by a power
fully equal to that which St Anthony might be supposed to possess,
into St Mawe's harbour, and happily landed on that very spot where the church now
stands. And it appears that the materials with which the tower is
built, and the situation which the church and tower occupy, are
calculated to give sanction to this tradition.</p>
