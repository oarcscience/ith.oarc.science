<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MERMAID OF PADSTOW.</p>
<P>THE port of Padstow has a good natural harbour, so far as
rocky area goes, but it is so choked up with drifting sands as to be nearly
useless. A peasant recently thus explained the cause. He told how &quot;it was once
deep water for the largest vessel, and under the care of a merry-maid--as he
called her; but one day, as she was sporting on the surface, a fellow with a
gun shot at her. &quot;She dived for a moment; but re-appearing, raised her right
arm, and vowed that henceforth the harbour should be desolate.&quot; &quot;And,&quot; added
the old man, &quot;it always will be so. We have had commissions, and I know not
what, about converting this place into a harbour of refuge. A harbour of
refuge would be a great blessing, but not all the Goyernment commissions in
the world could keep the sand out, or make the harbour deep enough to swim a
frigate, unless the parsons can find out the way to take up the merry-maid's
curse.&quot;</p>
<P>Another tale refers the choking up of this harbour to the bad
spirit Tregeagle. --</p>
