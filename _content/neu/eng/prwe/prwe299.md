THE LIMP CORPSE.

IF a corpse stiffens shortly after death, all is thought to proceed
naturally; but if the limbs remain flexible, some one of the family is
shortly to follow. If the eyes of a corpse are difficult to close, it is
said "they are looking after a follower."

To find a louse on one's linen, is a sign of sickness. To find. two,
indicates a severe illness. If three lice are so found within a month,
it is a "token to prepare."

Talking backwards, or putting one word incorrectly before another,--"the
cart before the horse,"--is considered to foretell that you will shortly
see a stranger.

If two young people, in conversation, happen to think of the same thing
at the same time, and one of them utters the thought before the other,
that one is certain to be married first.
