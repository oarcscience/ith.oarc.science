<P ALIGN="CENTER">PACKS OF WOOL THE FOUNDATION OF THE
BRIDGE OF WADEBRIDGE</p>
<P>LOVEBONE was the vicar of Wadebridge, and there
was a ferry across the river. It was a frequent custom for the
farmers to ride their horses and to drive their cattle across when
the tide was low, and frequently men and beasts were lost in the
quicksands formed on the rising of the tide. A sad accident of this
kind happened, and Lovebone resolved on building a bridge; as Leland
says in his &quot; Itinerary,&quot; &quot;Then one Lovebone, vicar of Wadebridge,
moved with pitie, began the bridge, and with great paine and studie,
good people putting their help thereto, finished it with xvii fair
and great uniform arches of stone.&quot;</p>
<P>Great was the labour, and frequent the
disappointment. Pier after pier were built, and then they were lost in
the sands. A &quot;fair structure&quot; was visible at night, in the morning
there was no trace of the work of the masons. Lovebone almost
despaired of success, indeed he was about to abandon the work, when he
dreamed that an angel came with a flock of sheep, that he sheared
them, let the wool fall into the water, and speedily built the bridge
upon the wool.</p>
<P>Lovebone awoke with a new idea. He gathered from
the farmers around, all the wool they would give him, he put it
loosely into packs, placed these thickly upon the sand, and built his
piers. The work remains to this day in proof of the engineering skill
of the suggesting angel. [a]</p>
<P>Quoting Beaumont and Fletcher's &quot;Knight of the
Burning Pestle,&quot; we find the Citizen saying to the Prologue:</p>
<P>&quot;Why could you not be content as well as others,
with the Legend of Whittington? or the Life and Death of Sir Thomas
Gresham, with the building of the Royal Exchange? or the Story of
Queen Eleanor, with the rearing of London Bridge upon woolsacks?&quot;</p>
