<P ALIGN="CENTER">ITCHING EARS</p>
<P>
&nbsp;WHEN the ears are red and itch, it is a sign that some one
is talking of the suffering individual. If it is the left ear, they are
being scandalised; if the right ear, they are being praised.</p>
<P>Often have I heard, when the lower and middle class people
have been indulging in some gossip of their neighbours or friends, &quot;I 'II
bet how their ears do itch.&quot;</p>
