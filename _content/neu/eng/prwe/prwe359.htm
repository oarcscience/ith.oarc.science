<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE HARLYN PIE</p>
<P>THE Peter family, who formerly lived at Harlyn, left
the place, and sold the estate to a farmer. The common report was that
one of the family manured his land with earth from the graves in
Constantine churchyard.</p>
<P>A considerable quantity of land formerly said to
belong to the poor of the parish cannot now he found, as all the marks
are gone.</p>
<P>The gold collar deposited in the Royal Institution at
Truro, by H.R.H., the Duke of Cornwall, was found on the Harlyn estate.</p>
