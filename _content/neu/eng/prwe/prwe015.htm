<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOM AND THE GIANT BLUNDERBUSS; OR, THE WHEEL AND EXE FIGHT.
[a]</p>
<P><br>
YOUNG giant, who does not appear to have been known by any other name than
Tom, lived somewhere westward of Hayle, probably in Lelant. Tom would eat as
much meat as three men, and when he was in the humour he could do as much work
as half a dozen. Howbeit, Tom was a lazy fellow, and spent most of his time
wandering about the parish with his hands in his pockets. Occasionally Tom
would have an industrious fit; then, if he found any of his neighbours
hedging, he would turn to and roll in all the largest rocks from over the
fields, for &quot;grounders&quot; [b] This was the only work Tom took delight in; he was
won't to say, he could feel his strength about such work as that Tom didn't
appear so very big a man in those days, when all men were twice the size they
are now. He was about four feet from shoulder to shoulder, square built, and
straight all the way down from shoulder to cheens (loins).</p>
<P>Tom's old mother was constantly telling her idle son to do
something to earn his food, but the boy couldn't find any job to his mind for
a long time. At last he undertook to drive a brewer's wain, in the hope of
getting into plenty of strong drink, and he went to live in Market-Jew, where
the brewery was. The, first day he was so employed, he was going to St Ives
with his load of beer, and on the road he saw half a score of men trying to
lift a fallen tree on to a &quot;draw.&quot; It was, however, more than the whole of
them could do.</p>
<P>&quot;Stand clear!&quot; shouts Tom.</p>
<P>He put his hands, one on each side of the tree, and lifted
it on the &quot;draw,&quot; without so much as saying &quot;Ho!' to his oxen, or looking
behind him. The feat was performed in Ludgvan Lees, and a little farther on
was a giant's place diverting the road, which should have gone straight to St
Ives but for it. This place was hedged in with great rocks, which no ten men
of these times could move. They call them the Giant's Hedges to the present
day. There was a gate on that side of the giant's farm which was nearest
Market-Jew, and another on that side which joined the highway leading on to St
Ives. Tom looked at the gate for some time, half disposed to drive through,
but eventually he decided on proceeding by the ordinary road. When, however,
Tom was coming back from St Ives with his empty wain, his courage screwed up
by the influence of some three or four gallons of strong beer which he had
drunk, he began to reason with himself thus</p>
<P>&quot;The king's highway ought not to be twisting and turning
like an angle-twitch. [c] It should go straight through here. What right has
the giant to keep his place closed, stopping honester men than he ever was
longer on the road home? If everybody were of my mind, the road would soon be
opened. Faith, I'll drive through. He wouldn't eat me, I suppose. My old mammy
never told me I was to come to my end that way. They say the giant has had
scores of wives. What becomes of them nobody can tell; yet there are always
more ready to supply their place. Well, that 's no business of mine. I never
met the man to make me turn back yet; so come along, Neat and Comely,&quot; shouts
Tom to the oxen, opening the great gate for them to pass through. On went Tom,
without seeing anything of the giant or of anybody else, except the fat cattle
of all sorts in the fields. After driving about a mile, Tom came to a pair of
gates in a high wall, which was close to and surrounding the giant's castle.
There was no passing round those, as deep ditches, full of water, were on
either side of these gates. So at them went Tom. The huge gates creaked on
their hangings and the wheels of Tom's wain rattled on over the causey. [d] A
little ugly midgan of a cur began to bark, and out tore the giant, a great
ugly unshapely fellow, all head and stomach.</p>
<P>&quot;You impudent little villain,&quot; roared the giant, &quot;to drive
into my grounds, disturbing my afternoon's nap. What business have you here?&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;I am on the road,&quot; says Tom, &quot;and you--nor a better man
than you--shan't put me back. You ha' no right to build your hedges across
what used to be the king's highway, and shall be again.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;I shan't bemean myself to talk with such a little saucy
blackguard as thee art,&quot; said the giant; &quot;I'll get a twig, and drive thee out
faster than 'thee came in.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; says Tom, &quot;you may keep your breath to cool your
porridge; but, if that's the game you are up to, I can play at that as well as
you.&quot;</p>
<P>The giant had pulled up a young elm-tree, about twenty feet
high or so, and he began stripping the small branches from the head of the
tree, as he came up the hill, gaping (yawning) all the time, .as if he were
half asleep. Tom, seeing what he was up to, upset his wain. this he did
without the oxen moving, as the tuntsy (pole) turned round in the ring of the
yoke. He then slipped off the further wheel in a wink, hauled out the exe 
(axle-tree) fast in the other wheel, against the giant came up. (In old time
the axle was made to work in gudgeons under the carts or wains.)</p>
<P>&quot;Now then,&quot; says Tom, &quot;fair play for the buttons. If you
can beat me, I'll go back. The exe and wheel is my sword and buckler, which
I'll match against your elm-tree.&quot; Then Torn began whistling.</p>
<P>The giant got round the uphill side, lifted his tree, and
tore towards Tom without saying a word, as if he would cleave him from head to
heel.</p>
<P>Tom lifted the axle-tree, with the wheel, up, to guard off
the blow of the giant's twig--the giant being in such a towering passion to
hear Tom coolly whistling all the time, that he couldn't steady himself. He
missed Tom's head, struck the edge of the wheel, and, the ground being
slippery, the giant fell upon his face on the ground. Tom might have driven
the &quot; exe&quot; through him as he lay sprawling in the mud, and so have nailed him
to the earth; but no, not he! Tom would rather be killed than not fight fair,
so he just tickled the giant under the ribs with the end of the &quot;exe.&quot; &quot;Come,
get up,&quot; says Tom, &quot;let 's have another turn.&quot; The giant rose very slowly, as
if he were scarcely able to stand, bent double, supporting himself on his
twig. He was only dodging--the great cowardly skulk--to get the uphill side
again, and take Tom unawares; but he was waiting with his right hand grasping
the &quot;exe,&quot; the wheel resting on the ground. Quick as lightning the giant
raised his tree. Tom fetched him a heavy kick on the shins, he slipped, fell
forward, and Tom so held the &quot;exe,&quot; that it passed through his body like a
spit. Good Lord, how the giant roared!</p>
<P>&quot;Thee stop thy bleating,&quot; says Tom. &quot;Stand quiet a moment.
Let 's draw the exe out of thy body, and I'II give thee a chance for another
round. Thee doesn't deserve it, because thee aren't playing fair.&quot;</p>
<P>Tom turned the giant over, laid hold of the wheel, and
dragged out the &quot;exe.&quot; In doing this he was nearly blinded with the blood that
spouted out of the hole. Blunderbuss rolled on the ground like an empty sack,
roaring amain all the time in great agony.</p>
<P>&quot;Stop thy bleating,&quot; says Tom, &quot;and put thy hands in the
hole the 'exe' has made in thee, to keep in the blood, until I can cut a turf
to stop up the place, and thee will'st do again yet.&quot;</p>
<P>As Tom was plugging the wound with the turfs, the giant
groaned and said, &quot;It's all no good; I shall kick the bucket. I feel myself
going round land; but with my last breath I 'll do thee good, because I like
thee better than anybody else I ever met with, for thy fair play and courage.
The more thee wouldst beat me, the better I should like thee. I have no near
relations. There is heaps of gold, silver, copper, and tin down in the vaults
of the castle, guarded by two dogs. Mind there names are Catchem and Tearem.
Only call them by these names and they'll let thee pass. The land from this to
the sea is all mine. There is more head of oxen, cows, sheep, goats, and deer,
than thee canst count. Take them all, only bury me decent.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Did you kill all your wives?&quot; asked Tom.</p>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; sighed the giant, &quot;they died natural. Don't let them
abuse me after death. I like thee as a brother.&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;Cheer up,&quot; says Torn, &quot;you 'll do again.&quot;</p>
<P>He then tried to raise the giant up, but the plug of turf
slipped from the wound, and all was over. </p>
<P>Tom put the wheel and axle in order, turned over the wain,
and drove home to Market-Jew. The brewer was surprised and well pleased to see
Tom back so early, and offered him good wages to stop for the year.</p>
<P>&quot;I must leave this very night,&quot; says Tom, &quot;for my old
granfer, who lived up in the high countries, is dead. I am his nearest
relation. He lived all alone. He 's left me all his money and lands, so I must
go and bury my old granfer this very night.&quot; The brewer was about to pay him
for his day's work--&quot; Oh, never mind that,&quot; says Tom; &quot; I 'll give up that
for as much beer as I can drink with supper.&quot;</p>
<P>After supper Torn went and took possession of the giant's
castle and lands--nobody the wiser except a little woman, the giant's last
wife, who came from some place not far from the castle. Some name Crowlas,
some Tregender, others Bougiehere, as the place where she dwelt. Howbeit, she
knew all about the giant's overthrow, and thought it the wisest course to
&quot;take up&quot; at once with Torn; and she being a tidy body, Tom was by no means
unwilling. Tom and this woman took possession of the castle. They buried the
giant down in the bottom, and placed a block of granite to keep him down. They
gave the carcass of a sheep to Catchem and Tearem, visited the caves of the
castle, found lots of treasure, and fairly got into the giant's shoes.</p>
<P>[a] The similarity of this story to the
well-known tale of &quot;Tom Hickathrift&quot; will strike every one. It might be supposed
that the old story of the strong man of the Isle of Ely&nbsp; had been read by
some Cornish man, and adapted to the local peculiarities, This may possibly have
been the case, but I do not think it probable. I first heard the story from a
miner, on the floors of Ding-Doug Mine, during my earliest tour in search of old
stories. I have since learned that it was a common story with the St Ives
nurses, who told it to amuse or terrify their children. Recently, I have had the
same tale communicated to me by a friend, who got it from a farmer living in
Lelant. This story is confined to the parishes of Lelant, St Ives, Sancreed,
Towednach, Moors, and Zentror. Mr Halliwell thinks the adventures of Tons
Hickathrift are connected with &quot;some of the insurrections in the Isle of Ely,
such as that of Herewood, described in Wright's ' Essays,' ii. 91&quot; Now, Herewood
the Saxon is said to have taken refuge in the extreme part of Cornwall, and we
are told of many romantic adventures, chiefly in connection with the beautiful
daughter of Alef, a Cornish chief. May it not be, that here we have the origin
of the story as it is told in Lincolnshire and in Cornwall?</p>
<P>[b] in making the really Cyclopean
hedges which prevail in some parts of Cornwall, the large boulders of granite,
or other stones, which lie scattered on the moors are used for the foundation.
Indeed, one purpose, and a very important one, served by those hedges, has been
the removal of the stones from the ground which has been enclosed, and the
disposal of the sones so removed.</p>
