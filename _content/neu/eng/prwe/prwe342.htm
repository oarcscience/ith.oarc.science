<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MERMAID'S VENGEANCE</p>
<P>&quot;INEVITABLE death awaits the wretch who is seduced by
their charms. They seize and drown the swimmer, and entice the child; aitd
when they anticipate that their malevolence will be gratified, they are seen
gaily darting over the surface of the waters.&quot;</p>
<P>Since lhis tale has been in type, my attention has been
called to an article on, the &quot;Popular Mythology of the Middle Ages,&quot; by Sir
F. Palgrave, in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. 44, 1820. The Nixies, to
whom the above quotation especially refers, are in most respects like the
Cornish mermaids.</p>
