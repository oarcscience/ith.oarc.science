<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE WITCH OF TREVA.</p>
<P>Once a time, long ago, there lived at Treva, a hamlet in
Zennor, a wonderful old lady deeply skilled in necromancy. Her charms,
spells, and dark incantations made her the terror of the neighbourhood.
However, this old lady failed to impress her husband with any belief in her
supernatural powers, nor did he fail to proclaim his unbelief aloud.</p>
<P>One day this sceptic came home to dinner, and found,
being exceedingly hungry, to his bitter disappointment, that not only was
there no dinner to eat, but that there was no meat in the house. His rage
was great, but all he could get from his wife was, &quot;I couldn't get meat out
of the stones, could I ?&quot; It was in vain to give the reins to passion, the
old woman told him, and he must know &quot;that hard words buttered no parsnips.&quot;
Well, at length he resolved to put his wife's powers to the proof, and he
quietly but determinedly told her that he would be the death of her if she
did not get him some dinner; but if in half an hour she gave him some good
cooked meat, he would believe all she had boasted of her power, and be
submissive to her for ever. St Ives, the nearest market-town, was five miles
off; but nothing doubting, the witch put on her bonnet and cloak, and
started. Her husband watched her from their cottage door, down the hill; and
at the bottom of the hill, he saw his wife quietly place herself on the
ground and disappear. In her place a fine hare ran on at its full speed.</p>
<P>He was not a little startled, but he waited, and within
the half-hour in walked his wife with &quot;good flesh and taties all ready for
aiting.&quot; There was no longer any doubt, and the poor husband lived in fear
of the witch of Treva to the day of her death.</p>
<P>This event took place after a few years, and it is said
the room was full of evil spirits, and that the old woman's shrieks were
awful to hear. Howbeit, peace in the shape of pale-faced death came to her
at last, and then a black cloud rested over the house when all the heavens
were clear and blue.</p>
<P>She was borne to the grave by six aged men, carried, as
is the custom, underhand. When they were about half way between the house
and the church, a hare started from the roadside am leaped over the coffin.
The terrified bearers let the corpse fall to the ground, and ran away.
Another lot of men took up the coffin and proceeded. They had not gone far
when puss was suddenly seen seated on the coffin, and again the coffin was
abandoned After long consultation, and being persuaded by the parson to
carry the old woman very quickly into the churchyard, while he walked
before, six others made the attempt, and as the parson never ceased to
repeat the Lord's Prayer, all went on quietly. Arrived at the church stile,
they rested the corpse, the parson paused to commence the ordinary burial
service, and there stood the hare which, as soon as the clergyman began &quot;I
am the resurrection and the life,&quot; uttered a diabolical howl, changed into a
black, un-shapen creature, and disappeared.</p>
