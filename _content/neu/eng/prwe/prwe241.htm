<P ALIGN="CENTER">TOWEDNACK CUCKOO FEAST.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;THE parish feast takes place
on the nearest Sunday to the 28th of April.</p>
<P>It happened in very early times, when winters extended
further into the spring than they now do, that one of the old inhabitants
resolved to be jovial, notwithstanding the inclemency of the season; so he
invited all his neighbours, and to warm his house he placed on the burning
faggots the stump of a tree. It began to blaze, and, inspired by the
warmth and light, they began to sing and drink; when, lo ! with a whiz and
a whir, out flew a bird from the hollow in the stump, crying, Cuckoo !
cuckoo ! The bird was caught and kept by the farmer, and he and his
friends resolved to renew the festal meeting every year at this date, and
to call it their &quot;cuckoo feast.&quot; Previous to this event Towednack had no
&quot;feasten Sunday,&quot; which made this parish a singular exception to the rule
in Cornwall.</p>
<P>This feast is sometimes called &quot;crowder&quot; feast, because
the fiddler formed a procession at the church door, and led the people
through the village to some tune on his &quot;crowd.&quot;</p>
