<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SPANIARD AT PENRYN</p>
<P>IN the reign of James I. there happened to be upon our
coast a Spanish vessel of war. Favoured by the mists of evening and the
growing darkness, the ship entered Falmouth Harbour unseen. The crew armed
themselves, and taking to their boats, proceeded with great caution to the
town of Penryn, situated at the head of the harbour. There they landed,
formed themselves into proper order, and marched into the town, purposing to
plunder the inhabitants and bum the town. With steady tramp they cautiously
proceeded up the dark main street, resolving to attack the principal
dwellings first. Suddenly a great shout was heard, drums and trumpets
sounded, the noise of many feet rushing to and fro fell on the ears of the
Spaniards. Believing that they were discovered, and that preparations had
been made for their reception, fear seized them, and they fled precipitately
to their boats and left the town. The martial music proceeded, however, from
a temporary theatre, in which a troop of strolling players were entertaining
the people.</p>
