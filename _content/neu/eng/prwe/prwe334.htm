<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE GIANT OF NANCLEDRY; AND
TREBIGGAN THE GIANT</p>
<P>FROM time to time, in. Cornwall and other places, bones
of a large size have been found, and very exaggerated accounts of these
finds have beets published. Some years since it was currently reported that
the bones of a giant had been discovered in Wendron, and they were said to
be &quot;prodigious.</p>
<P>I have endeavoured to trace this matter. And now I have
evidence to show that the whole affair was greatly exaggerated. The
following extracts from letters will place the whole matter in its true
light :-- </p>
<P>&quot;The discovery under the chancel window at Wendron, in the
beginning of the year 1855, consisted simply of a <i>large collection of
bones</i>, plainly human, at the depth of less <i>than two feet</i> beneath
the floor! This accounted in a great measure for the extraordinary dampness
of this part of the church, and which it was in part my object to get rid
of.</p>
<P>&quot;Many of these bones, especially the femoral and crural,
were certainly of an unusual magnitude, as compared with others which from
time to time had been disinterred in the churchyard when a grave had been
dug. I cannot state with any degree of certainty whether the dimensions of
the largest bones were accurately measured.</p>
<P>&quot;Being desirous to re-inter the bones found in the
chancel of Wendron as nearly as possible in the same place, though at a
considerable depth, we came at length (after the removal of much damp soil)
to a perfect stone sarcophagus, as far as I recollect about six feet in
length. The upper lid of this was not to be found. In the said sarcophagus,
containing little more than dust, we laid all the gigantic bones which had
been discovered.&quot;</p>
<P>Another correspondent informs me, that closer inquiry has
probably connected these bones with a well known man.</p>
<P>The curate of the parish informs me &quot;that there is a
brass in the church to the memory of 'Metheruny,' attached to the collegiate
establishment of Glaseney in the time of Henry VIII., which he supposed to
refer to a grave situated in the spot where the relics referred to by Mr.
Boraston were found. Mr. Mime also told me, that among the published
engravings of Holbein's portraits was a fine one of this 'Metheruny,'
respecting whom are some interesting particulars in King's 'Monumenta
Antiqua,' Dugdale's 'Monasticon,' and Bulase's 'Cornwall.'&quot;</p>
