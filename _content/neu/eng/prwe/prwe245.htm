<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE ZENNOR CHARMERS.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;BOTH men and women in this parish possessed this power
to a remarkable degree. They could stop blood, however freely it might be
flowing. &quot;Even should a pig be sticked in tie very place, if a charmer was
present, and <i>thought</i> of his charm at the time, the pig would not
bleed.&quot; This statement, made by a Zennor man, shows a tolerably large
amount of faith in their power. The charmers are very cautious about
communicating their charms. A man would not on any account tell his charm
to a woman, or a woman communicate hers to a man. People will travel many
miles to have themselves or their children charmed for &quot;wildfires&quot;
(erysipelas), ringworms, pains in the limbs or teeth, &quot;kennels&quot; on the
eyes (ulcerations). A correspondent writes me :-- &quot;Near this lives a lady
charmer, on whom I called. I found her to be a really clever, sensible
woman. She was reading a learned treatise on ancient history. She told me
there were but three charmers left in the west,--one at New Mill, one in
Morva, and herself.&quot; Their charm for stopping blood is but another version
of one given on another page.</p>
