PERRAN WELL.

CHILDREN were cured of several diseases by being bathed in this well.
They were also carried to the sea-shore, and passed through a cleft in a
rock on the shore at Perranzabalo. In the autumn of 1863 I sought for
these holy waters. I was informed that some miners, in driving an adit,
had tapped the spring and drained it. There is not, therefore, a trace
of this once most celebrated well remaining. It was with difficulty that
its site could be discovered. I have since learned that the cut
stone-work which ornamented this holy place, was removed to Chiverton,
for the purpose of preserving it.
