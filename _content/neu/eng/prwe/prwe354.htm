<P ALIGN="CENTER">SARACEN</p>
<P>THE term Saracen is always now supposed to apply to
the Moors. This is not exactly correct. Percy, for example, in his
&quot;Essay on the Ancient Minstrels,&quot; says, &quot;The old metrical romance of
'Horn Child,' which, although from the mention of Saracens, &amp;c., it must
have been written, at least, after the First Crusade in 1096, yet, from
its Anglo-Saxon language or idiom, can scarcely be dated later than
within a century after the Conquest.&quot; I think this ballad, and several
others of an early date, prove the application of this term to some
Oriental people previous to the Crusades. Sold&#224;in, sold&#224;n, regarded as a
corruption of sultan,-- </p>
<P>
&quot;Whoever will fight yon grimme sold&#224;n,</p>
<P>
Right fair his meede shall be,&quot;</p>
<P>is clearly n much older term, applied to any grim
Eastern tyrant, and especially to the Oriental giants. It would not be a
difficult task to show that the word &quot;Saracen,&quot; as used in Cornwall,--' '<i>Atal
Saracen !</i>&quot; &quot;<i>Oh, he's a Saracen !</i>&quot; &amp;c., was applied to the
foreigners who traded with this country for tin at a very early period.</p>
