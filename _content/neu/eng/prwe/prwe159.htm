<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE BATTLE OF VELLA N-DRUCHAR. [a]</p>
<P>THE Sea Kings, in their predatory wanderings, landed in
Genvor Cove, and, as they had frequently done on previous occasions, they
proceeded to pillage the little hamlet of Escols. On one occasion they
landed in unusally large numbers, being resolved, as it appeared, to spoil
many of the large and wealthy towns of Western Cornwall, which they were led
to believe were unprotected. It fortunately happened that the heavy surf on
the beach retarded their landing, so that the inhabitants had notice of
their threatened invasion.</p>
<P>That night the beacon-fire was lit on the chapel hill,
another was soon blazing on Castle-an-Dinas, and on Trecrobben. Cam Brea
promptly replied, and continued the signal-light, which also blazed
lustrously that night on St Agnes Beacon. Presently the fires were seen on
Belovely Beacon, and rapidly they appeared on the Great Stone, on St
Bellarmine's Tor, and Cadbarrow, and then the fires blazed out on Roughtor
and Brownwilly, thus rapidly conveying the intelligence of war to Prince
Arthur and his brave knights, who were happily assembled in full force at
Tintagel to do honour to several native Princes who were at that time on a
visit to the King of Cornwall. Arthur, and nine other kings, by forced
marches, reached the neighbourhood of the Land's-End at the end of two days.
The Danes crossed the land down through the bottoms to the sea on the
northern side of the promontory, spreading destruction in their paths.
Arthur met them on their return, and gave them battle near Vellan-Druchar.
So terrible was the slaughter, that the mill was worked with blood that day.
Not a single Dane of the vast army that had landed escaped. A few had been
left in charge of the ships, and as soon as they learned the fate of their
brethren, they hastened to escape, hoping to return to their own northern
land. A holy woman, whose name has not been preserved to us, &quot;brought home a
west wind&quot; by emptying the Holy Well against the hill, and sweeping the
church from the door to the altar. Thus they were prevented from escaping,
and were all thrown by the force of a storm and the currents either on the
rocky shore, or on the sands, where they were left high and dry. It happened
on the occasion of an extraordinary spring-tide, which was yet increased by
the wind, so that the ships lay high up on the rocks, or on the sands; and
for years the birds built their nests in the masts and rigging.</p>
<P>Thus perished the last army of Danes who dared to land upon
our western shores.</p>
<P>King Arthur and the nine kings pledged each other in the
holy water from St Sennen's Well, they returned thanks for their victory in
St Sennen's Chapel, and dined that day on the Table-men.</p>
<P>Merlin, the prophet, was amongst the host, and the feast
being ended, he was seized with the prophetic afflatus, and in the hearing
of all the host proclaimed-- </p>
<P>&quot;The northmen wild once more shall land,<br>
And leave their bones on Escol's sand.<br>
The soil of Vellan-Druchar's plain<br>
Again shall take a sanguine stain;<br>
And o'er the mill-wheel roll a flood<br>
Of Danish mix'd with Cornish blood.<br>
When thus the vanquish'd find no tomb,<br>
Expect the dreadful day of doom.&quot;</p>
<P>[a] Vellan (mill), druchar (wheel).</p>
