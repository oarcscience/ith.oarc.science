<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SPRIGGAN'S CHILD, AS TOLD BY A CORNISH DROLL.</p>
<P><br>
I'LL tell you a tale, an you've patience to hear an, <br>
'Bout the Spriggans, that swarm round Partinney still-- <br>
You knew Janey Tregeer, who lives in Brea Vean,</p>
<P>In the village just under the Chapel Hill.<br>
One arternoon she went out for to reap,<br>
And left the child in the cradle asleep:<br>
Janey took good care to cover the fire;-- <br>
Turn'd down the brandis on the baking.ire (iron),<br>
Swept up the ashes on the hearthstone,<br>
And so left the child in the house all alone--<br>
The boys had all on 'em gone away,<br>
Some to work and some to play.<br>
Janey work'd in the field as gay as a lark,<br>
And when she came home it was nearly dark;<br>
The furst thing she saw when she open'd the door<br>
Was the cradle upset--all the straw on the floor.</p>
<P>But no child in sight--<br>
She search'd all round --<br>
Still no child was found:<br>
And it got dark night.<br>
So great was Jane's fright,<br>
That for more than an hour<br>
She hadn't the power <br>
To strike a light.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<P>However, she kindled the fire at last,<br>
And threw in a faggot to make a blast.<br>
As she stoop'd over the wood.corner stone, <br>
She heard a sound 'tween a cry and a moan --<br>
It clearly came from a bundle of ferns--<br>
The two bigger boy's bed--<br>
And there, sure enough, as frighten'd she turns, <br>
Janey saw the child's head.</p>
<P>'Twas very queer. How the child got there, <br>
Nobody could say;Yet ever since that day, the <br>
And blinking and peeping, when it ought to be sleeping,<br>
But seldom it closed its eyes. <br>
Jane said for a child it look'd too wise --<br>
That, she thought it a changeling<br>
She didn't disguise--<br>
And often and often the gave it a beating,<br>
To stop--but she couldn't--its cussed bleating.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>Janey resolved to work the spell,<br>
And whene'er she could stay, <br>
She bath'd the brat in the Chapel Well --<br>
Which he thought rare play. </p>
<P>On the three first Wednesdays in flow'ry May<br>
She plunged it deep at the dawn of day--<br>
Pass'd it slowly three times against the sun,<br>
Went three times round,--and when all was clone,<br>
The imp of a child roar'd aloud for fun. <br>
No tongue can tell<br>
The trouble it gave her<br>
To dip the shaver, <br>
And work the spell.</p>
<P>From Brea to Chapel-Uny is a mile or more,<br>
And surely it tried Janey's patience sore<br>
To trudge forth and back from the Chapel Well,<br>
With this brat on her back, to work the spell.<br>
<br>
She wish'd it dead; but it wouldn't die:<br>
It ate its bread, it would pine and cry;<br>
And Janey was nearly beside herself<br>
With this plague of her life--this wicked elf.</p>

<P>Well, one rainy day,--as it rains in May,-- <br>
Janey set out with the child in her arms<br>
Once more to work the holy charms.<br>
When very close to the top of the hill, <br>
Where she was sure there was nobody near,<br>
She heard the strangest voice in her ear,<br>
Saying these words, quite clear and shrill --<br>
<i>
&quot;Tredrill Tredrill! thy wife and children greet thee well.&quot;</p>
</i>
<P>Oh, Janey's heart-strings were like to crack,<br>
When up spake the thing in her arms, good lack!--<br>
&quot; For wife or child little care I,<br>
They may laugh,<br>
Or they may cry,--<br>
While milk I quaff;<br>
When I am dry--<br>
Get of my pap my fill<br>
Whenever I will,<br>
On the dowdy's back ride,<br>
With my legs astride,<br>
When we work the spell<br>
At the Chapel Well&quot;</p>
<i>
</i>
<P>Janey dropp'd the cussed thing on the ground,<br>
And turn'd round, and round, and round;<br>
You may be sure she was in a fright<br>
To hear the sound, and nobody in sight,<br>
And to hear a child talkMonths before it could walk.<br>
She has said o'er and -o'er, <br>
And I am sure you can't wonder,<br>
'Twouldn't frighten her more,<br>
Had the rocks burst asunder,<br>
And the earth belch'd forth thunder,</p>
<i>
</i>
<P>When Janey at length got over the fright<br>
From hearing the sound and nobody in sight,<br>
And the brat which lay crying, as if it was dying,<br>
Talking out like a man of his wife and his child,<br>
She felt all bedazzled as if she was wild--<br>
Took the brat by the arm, flung it over her shoulder--<br>
Wouldn't believe it her child if the parson had told her--<br>
Thought the devil was in it,<br>
As she ran the hill down,<br>
Without -stopping a minute<br>
Till she came to Brea -town.</p>
<P>The old women came out, and all on 'em agreed <br>
'Twas the strangest thing that ever they seed; <br>
They stood in a row, and each one had a word --<br>
'Twas the wonderfull'st story that ever they heard; <br>
'Twas a Spriggan's brat--they were all sure of that--<br>
No more like Jane's child than an old ram-cat. <br>
She must beat it black, she must beat it blue, <br>
Bruise its body all o'er with the heel of her shoe--<br>
Then lay it alone beneath the church stile, <br>
And keep out of hearing and sight for a while--<br>
When every one said, as every one thought, <br>
That Janey's child would again be brought:<br>
Some said 'twould be living--some said 'twould be dead - <br>
But the Spriggan's base brat she no longer need dread.</p>
<i>
</i>
<P>Jane beat the babe black,<br>
And she beat the babe blue,<br>
On the ashes' pile before the door;<br>
And she would have beaten it ten times more,<br>
But out of her hand she lost her shoe,<br>
Struck away all at once - by she couldn't tell who.</p>
<i>
</i>
<P>The brat bad roar'd--it could roar no more--<br>
So they carried it off to the old church stile,<br>
And laid it under the stones--some swore<br>
That when placed on the earth it was seen to smile --<br>
Then all turn'd back, and kept far out of sight<br>
And Janey declared she was almost wild:<br>
But they kept her back till the turn o' the night,<br>
When she rush'd to the stile and found her own child</p>
<P>'Twas there, sure enough, her own dear child<br>
But when first she saw it,<br>
She did not know it-- It look'd so frighten'd--it seem'd so
wild.</p>
<i>
</i>
<P>Then the old women said,<br>
If it keeps its wits,<br>
We're sadly afraid<br>
The poor babe will have fits.</p>
<P>A friend writes me:-- &quot;I saw an account in a newspaper the other
day of an Irishwoman who was brought before the magistrates, in New York, for
causing the death of a child by making it stand on <i>hot coals</i>, to try if
it were her own truly begotten child, or a changeling. I think the notion was,
that her own child</p>
<P>would stand fire, but an imp would either die, to all <i>
appearance</i>, or be spirited away. This is much worse than the plan of the
woman of Brea Vean, who put the brat on the ashes' pile, and beat it black with
the broom.&quot; [a]</p>

in all its chief features, similar to this story, even to the beating hint
without mercy. &quot;Icelandic Legends. Collected by John Arnason: Translated by
