<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;WHO ARE THE KNOCKERS ?&quot;</p>
<P>CHARLES KINGSLEY in his &quot;Yeast: a Problem,&quot; asks this
question--Tregarra answers,--&quot;They are <i>the ghosts, </i>the miners hold,
<i>of the old Jews that crucjfled our Lord, and were sent for slaves by the
Roman emperors to work the mines: </i>and we find their old smelting-houses,
which we call <i>Jews' houses, </i>and their blocks at the bottom of the
great bogs, which we call <i>Jews' tin: </i>and then a town among us too,
which we call <i>Market Jew, </i>but the old name was Marazion, that means
the bitterness of Zion, they tell me; and bitter work it was for them, no
doubt, poor souls ! We used to break into old shafts and adits which they
had made, and find flue old stag's-horn pick-axes, that crumbled to pieces
when we brought them to grass. And they say that if a man will listen of a
still night about these shafts, he may hear the ghosts of them at work,
knocking and picking, as clear as if there was a man at work in the next
level.&quot;</p>
<P>In <i>Notes and Queries </i>will be found some learned
discussions on the question of the Jews working the Cornish tin mines, as
though it were merely one of tradition. That the Jews farmed the tin mines
of Cornwall and Devonshire is an historical fact, of which we have evidence
in charters granted by several of our kings, especially by King John. Carew
in his &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; gives some account of their mode of dealing with
the tinners. Hence the terms &quot;Jews' houses,&quot; given to old and rude smelting
works,--many of which I have seen,--and hence the name of &quot;Jews' tin,&quot; given
to the old blocks of tin, specimens of which may be seen in the <i>Museum of
Practical Geology, </i>and in the museum of the <i>Royal Institution of
Cornwall, </i>at Truro. <i>&quot;Atall Sarazin&quot; </i>is another term applied to
some of the old waste-heaps of the ancient tin mines. -</p>
<P>&quot;The Jews,&quot; says Whitaker (&quot; Origin of Arianism,&quot; p. <i>
334), </i>&quot;denominated themselves, and were denominated by the Britons of
Cornwall, <i>Saracens, </i>as the genuine progeny of Sarah.&quot; Be this as it
may, I have often heard in the mining villages--from twenty to thirty years
since--a man coming from a distant parish, called <i>&quot;a foreignerer;&quot; </i>a
man from a distant country, termed <i>&quot;an outlandish man;&quot; </i>and any one
not British born, designated as &quot;a <i>Saracen.&quot;</p>
</i>
<P>But this has led me away from the knockers, who are in some
districts called also <i>&quot;the buccas&quot; </i>Many a time have I been seriously
informed by the miners themselves that these sprites have been heard working
away in the remote parts of a lode, repeating the blows of the miner's pick
or sledge with great precision. Generally speaking, the knockers work upon
productive lodes only; and they have often kindly indicated to the trusting
miners, where they might take good tribute pitches.</p>
<P>To Wesley, Cornwall owes a deep debt. He found the country
steeped in the darkness of superstitious ignorance, and he opened a new
light upon it. Associated with the spread of Wesleyan Methodism, has been
the establishment of schools; and under the influence of religion and
education, many of the superstitions have faded away. We rarely hear of the
knockers now; but the following occurrence will show that the knockers have
not entirely left the land:-- </p>
<P>One Saturday night I had retired to rest, having first seen
that all the members of the household had gone to their bedrooms. These were
my daughters, two female servants, and an old woman, named Mary, who was
left, by the proprietor, in charge of the house which I occupied.</p>
<P>I had been some time in bed, when I distinctly heard a
bedroom door open, and footsteps which, after moving about for some time in
the passage or landing, from which the bedrooms opened, slowly and carefully
descended the stairs. I heard a movement in the kitchen below, and the
footsteps again ascended the stairs, and went into one of the bedrooms. This
noise contiued so long, and was so regularly repeated, that I began to fear
lest one of the children were taken suddenly ill. Yet I felt assured, if it
was so, one of the servants would call me. Therefore I lay still and
listened until I fell asleep.</p>
<P>On the Sunday morning, when I descended to the breakfast
room, I asked the eldest of the two servants what had occasioned so much
going up and down stairs in the night. She declared that no one had left
their bedrooms after they had retired to them. I then inquired of the
younger girl, and of each of my daughters as they made their appearance. No
one had left their rooms--they had not heard any noises. My youngest
daughter, who had been, after this inquiry of mine, for some minutes alone
with the youngest servant, came laughing to me,--</p>
<P>&quot;Papa, Nanny says the house is haunted, and that they have
often heard strange noises in it.&quot;</p>
<P>So I called Nancy; but all I could learn from her was that
noises, like that of men going up and down stairs,--of threshing corn, and
of &quot;beating the borer&quot; (a mining operation), were not uncommon.</p>
<P>We all laughed over papa's ghost during the breakfast, and
by and by old Mary made her appearance.</p>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;it is quite true, as Nanny as a told you.
I have often heard all sorts of strange noises; but I b'lieve they all come
from the lode of tin which runs under the house. <i>Wherever there is a lode
of tin, you are sure to hear strange noises.&quot;</p>
</i>
<P>&quot;What, Mary I was it the knockers I heard last night ?&quot;
&quot;Yes; 'twas the knackers, down working upon the tin--no doubt of it.&quot;</p>
<P>This was followed by a long explanation, and numerous
stories of mines in the Lelant and St Ives district, in which the knockers
had been often heard.</p>
<P>After a little time, Mary, imagining, I suppose, that the
your ladies might not like to sleep in a house beneath which the knockers
were at work, again came with her usual low courtesy into the parlour.</p>
<P>&quot;Beg pardon, sir,&quot; says she; &quot;but none of the young ladies
need be afraid. There are no spirits in the house; it is very nearly a new
one, and no one has ever died in the house.&quot;</p>
<P>This makes a distinct difference between the ghost of the
departed and those gnomes who are doomed to toil in the earth's dark
recesses.[a] The Cornish knocker does not appear to be the <i>&quot;cobal&quot; </i>of
German miners. The former are generally kindly, and often serve the
industrious miner; the latter class are always malicious, and, I believe,
are never heard but when mischief is near.</p>
<P>[a] &quot;Some are sent, like the spirit
Gathon in Cornwall, to work the will of his master in the mines.&quot;--Mrs
<i>Bray's Tradilians of Devonshire.</p>
</i>
<P>Who was the spirit Gathon ?</p>
<P>&quot;The miner starts as he hears the
mischievous Gathon answering blow for blow the stroke of his pickaxe, or
deluding him with false fires, noises, and flames.&quot;--A <i>
Guide to the Coasts of Devon and Cornwall. Mackenzie
Walcott, M.A.</p>
</i>
<P>Carne, in his &quot;Tales of the West,&quot;
alludes to this :-- &quot;The miners have their full share of the superstitious
feelings of the country, and often hear with alarm the noises, as it were,
of other miners at work deep underground, and at no great distance. The of
the barrows, the sound of the pickaxes, and the fall of the earth and
stones, are distinctly heard through the night,--often, no doubt, the echo
of their own labour; sometimes continued long after that labonr has ceased,
and occasionally voices seem to mingle with them. Gilbert believed that he
was peculiarly exposed to these visitations;
he had an instinctive
shrinking from the place where the accident had happened; and, when left
alone there, it was in vain that he plied his toil with desperate energy to
divert his thoughts. Another person appeared to work very near him: he
stayed the lifted pick and listened. The blow of the other fell distinctly,
and the rich ore followed it in a loud rollinng; he checked the loaded
barrow that he was wheeling; still that of the un&#173;known workman went on, and
came nearer and nearer, and then there followed a loud, faint cry, that
thrilled through every nerve of the lonely man, for it seemed like the voice
of his brother. These sounds as ceased on a sudden, and those which his own
toll caused were the only ones heard, till, after an interval, without any
warning, they began again at times more near, and again passing away to a
distance."--The <i>Tale of the Miner.</i></p>
