<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PADSTOW &quot;HOBBY-HORSE.&quot; [a]</p>
<P>
&nbsp;<br>
AT the time of the spring festival, which is observed at Helston as a
revel in honour, probably, of Flora, and hence called the &quot;Furry-day,&quot; and by
the blowing of horns and gathering of the &quot;May&quot; in St Ives and other places,
the people of Padstow were a few years since in the habit of riding the
&quot;hobby-horse&quot; to water. This hobby-horse was, after it had been taken round
the town, submerged in the sea. The old people said it was once believed that
this ceremony preserved the cattle of the inhabitants from disease and death.
The appearance of a white horse escaping from the flood which buried the
Lionesse, is told at several points, on both the north and south coast, and
the riding of the hobby-horse probably belongs to this tradition. In support
of this idea, we must not forget the mermaid story associated with the harbour
of Padstow.</p>
<P>The water-horse is a truly Celtic tradition. We have it in
the &quot;Arabian Nights,&quot; and in the stories of all countries in the south of
Europe. Mr Campbell, &quot;West Highland Tales,&quot; says he finds the horse brought
prominently forward in the Breton legends, and that animal figures largely in
the traditions of Scotland and Ireland.</p>
<P>Has the miners' phrase --&quot; a horse in the lode,&quot; applied to
a mass of unproductive ground in the middle of a mineral lode; or, &quot;Black Jack
rides a good horse,&quot; signifying that zinc ore gives good promise for copper --
anything to do with these traditions?</p>
