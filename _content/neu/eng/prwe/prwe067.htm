<P ALIGN="CENTER">MINCAMBER, MAIN-AMBER OR AMBROSE'S
STONE.</p>
<P><br>
MIGHTY Logan Stone was poised and blessed by Ambrose Merlin, not far from
Penzance. &quot;So great,&quot; says Drayton, in his &quot;Polyalbion,&quot; &quot;that many men's
united strength cannot remove it, yet with one finger you may wag it.&quot;</p>
<P>Merlin proclaimed that this stone should stand until England
had no king; and Scawen tells us--</p>
<P>&quot;Here, too, we may add what wrong another sort of strangers
have done to us, especially in the civil wars, and in particular by the
destroying of Mincamber, a famous monument, being a rock of infinite weight,
which, as a burden, was laid upon other great stones, and yet so equally
thereon poised up by nature only, that a little child could instantly move it,
but no one man, or many, remove it. This natural monument all travellers that
came that way desired to behold; but in the time of Oliver's usurpation, when
all monumental things became despicable, one Shrubsall, one of Oliver's
heroes, then Governor of Pendennes, by labour and much ado, caused to be
undermined and thrown down, to the great grief of the country, but to his own
great glory, as he thought; doing it, as he said, with a small cane in his
hand. I myself have heard him to boast of this act, being a prisoner under
him.&quot; [a]</p>
<P>So was Merlin's prophecy fulfilled.</p>

anointed or consecrated stones.&quot;--C. S Gilbert, <i>Historical Survey</i>. See

and Jabez Allie's &quot;Worcestershire.&quot; Appendiz O, <i>Ambrosiae Petrae</i>.</p>
