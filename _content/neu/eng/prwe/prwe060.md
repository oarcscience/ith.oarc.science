THE MERMAID OF PADSTOW.

THE port of Padstow has a good natural harbour, so far as rocky area
goes, but it is so choked up with drifting sands as to be nearly
useless. A peasant recently thus explained the cause. He told how "it
was once deep water for the largest vessel, and under the care of a
merry-maid--as he called her; but one day, as she was sporting on the
surface, a fellow with a gun shot at her. "She dived for a moment; but
re-appearing, raised her right arm, and vowed that henceforth the
harbour should be desolate." "And," added the old man, "it always will
be so. We have had commissions, and I know not what, about converting
this place into a harbour of refuge. A harbour of refuge would be a
great blessing, but not all the Goyernment commissions in the world
could keep the sand out, or make the harbour deep enough to swim a
frigate, unless the parsons can find out the way to take up the
merry-maid's curse."

Another tale refers the choking up of this harbour to the bad spirit
Tregeagle. --
