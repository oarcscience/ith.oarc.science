ROMANCES OF THE ROCKS.

CROMLECH AND DRUID STONES.

"Among the rocks and stones, methinks I see  
More than the heedless impress that belongs  
To lonely nature's casual work: they bear  
A semblance strange of power intelligent,  
And of design not wholly worn away."  
- *The Excursion* - WORDSWORTH

"Surely there is a hidden power that reigns  
'Mid the lone majesty of untamed nature,  
Controlling sober reason."  
-- *Caractacus*.--WILLIAM MASON.

IT is a common belief amongst the peasantry over every part of Cornwall,
that no human power can remove any of those stones which have been
rendered sacred to them by traditionary romance. Many a time have I been
told that certain stones had been removed by day, but that they always
returned by night to their original positions, and that the parties who
had dared to tamper with those sacred stones were punished in some way.
When the rash commander of a revenue cutter landed with a party of his
men and overturned the Logan Rock, to prove the folly of the prevalent
superstition, he did but little service in dispelling an old belief; but
proved himself to be a fool for his pains.

I could desire, for the preservation of many of our Celtic remains, that
we could impress the educated classes with a similar reverence for the
few relics which are left to us of an ancient and a peculiar people, of
whose history we know so little, and from whose remains we might, by
careful study, learn so much. Those poised stones and perforated rocks
must be of high antiquity, for we find the Anglo-Saxons making laws to
prevent the British people from pursuing their old pagan practices.
\[a\]

The geologist, looking upon the Logan stones and other curiously-formed
rock masses, dismisses at once from his mind the idea of their having
been formed by the hand of man, and hastily sets aside the tradition
that the Druid ever employed them, or that the old Celt ever regarded
them with reverence. There cannot be a doubt but that many huge masses
of granite are, by atmospheric causes, now slowly passing into the
condition required for the formation of a Logan rock. It is *possible*
that in some cases the "weathering" may have gone on so uniformly around
the stone, as to poise it so exactly that the thrust of a child will
shake a mass many tons in weight.

The result, however, of my own observations, made with much curiosity
and considerable care, has been to convince me, that in by far the
greatest number of instances the disintegration, though general around
the line of a "bed-way" or horizontal joint, has gone on rapidly on the
side exposed to the beat of the weather, while the opposite extremity
has been but slightly worn; consequently, the stones have a tendency to
be depressed on the sheltered side. With a little labour man could
correct this natural defect, and with a little skill make a poised
stone. We have incontrovertible evidence that certain poised stones have
been regarded, through long periods of time, as of a sacred character.
Whether these stones were used by the Druids, or merely that the
ignorant people supposed them to have some peculiar virtue, I care not.
The earliest inhabitants of Cornwall, probably Celts, \[b\] were
possessed with some idea that these stones were connected with the
mysteries of existence; and from father to son, for centuries,
notwithstanding the introduction of Christianity, these stones have
maintained their sacred character. Therefore, may we not infer that the
leaders of the people availed themselves of this feeling; and finding
many rocks of a gigantic size, upon which nature had begun the work,
they completed them, and used the mighty moving masses to impress with
terror--the principle by which they ruled--the untaught, but poetically
constituted, minds of the people. Dr Borlase has been laughed at for
finding rock-basins, the works of the Druids, in every granitic mass. At
the same time, those who laugh have failed to examine those rock-masses
with unprejudiced care, and hence they have erred as wildly as did the
Cornish antiquary, but in a contrary direction. Hundreds of depressions
are being formed by the winds and rains upon the faces of the granite
rocks. With these no Druid ever perplexed himself or his people. But
there are numerous hollows to be found in large flat rocks which have
unmistakably been formed, if not entirely, partly by the hands of man.
The Sacrificing Rock, or Cam Brea, is a remarkable example. The larger
hollows on the Men-rock, in Constantine, several basins in the Logan
Rock group, and at Cam Boscawen, may be referred to as other examples.
With these remarks, I proceed to notice a few of the most remarkable
rock-masses with which tradition has associated some tale.

probably in Scotland also, as the Anglo-Saxon laws repeatedly denounce
similar superstitious practices."--*The Archaeology and Prehistoric
Annals of Scotland*, p. 97. DANIEL WILSON.

districts of Cornwall, and preserved, almost to our own day, a distinct
dialect of the Celtic tongue."--*Prehistoric Annals a Scotland*, p. 195
