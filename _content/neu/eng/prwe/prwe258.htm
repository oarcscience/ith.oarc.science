<P ALIGN="CENTER">TO CHARM A SNAKE.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;WHEN an adder or snake is seen a circle is to be rapidly
drawn around it, and the sign of the cross made within it, while the two
first verses of the 68th Psalm are repeated :-- &quot;Let God arise, let his
enemies be scattered; let them also that hate him flee before him.</p>
<P>&quot;As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax
melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.&quot;</p>
<P>When a child, I well remember being shown a snake, not yet
dead, within a circle of this kind; the gardener who drew my attention to
the reptile informing me that he had charmed it in the manner related.</p>
