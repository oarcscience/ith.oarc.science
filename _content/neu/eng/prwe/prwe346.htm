<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CITY OF LANGARROW OR LANGONA.--
PERRAN CHURCHES.</p>
<P>NEAR the oldest Perran church there formerly existed a
lake called the <i>Vlow</i>, and across this lake the sand was never
blown. The sands encroached rapidly on the first church, and it was
resolved by the parish to build a church on the other side of the lake,
where it would be quite beyond the reach of the sands. The church was
built and remained for a long period free from the effects of the
blowing sands. At length a miner, called Roberts, drove an adit in from
the cliffs under the lake, to reach the mine now called Huel Vlow, and
this carried off all the water from the lake. Then the sands rapidly
advanced towards, and at length threatened to bury, the second church.
So great was the danger of this, that at length it was resolved to
remove the church to the position which it at present occupies. The
limits of the lake can be readily traced.</p>
<P>It is now said--and there is much appearance of truth
in it--that the sand will not cross the small stream which divides
Perranzabuloe from Cubert. Those who have watched the travelling of the
sand will understand the influence of running water in checking its
progress.</p>

common. <i>Gan</i>, a level plain, a down--same as <i>Goon</i>. </p>
