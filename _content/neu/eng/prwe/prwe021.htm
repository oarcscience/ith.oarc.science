<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE GIANT WRATH, OR RALPH.</p>
<P><br>
NOT far from Portreath there exists a remarkable fissure, or gorge, on the
coast, formed by the wearing out, through the action of the sea, of a channel
of ground softer than that which exists on either side of it. This is
generally known as Ralph's Cupboard; and one tale is, that Ralph was a famous
smuggler, who would run his little vessel, even in dark nights, into the
shelter afforded by this gorge, and safely land his goods. Another is, that it
was formerly a cavern in which dwelt Wrath--a huge giant--who was the terror
of the fishermen. Sailing from St Ives, they ever avoided the Cupboard; as
they said, &quot;Nothing ever came out of it which was unfortunate enough to get
into it.&quot; Wrath is reputed to have watched for those who were drifted towards
his Cupboard by currents, or driven in by storms. It is said that wading out
to sea, he tied the boats to his girdle, and quietly walked back to his den,
making, of &#224;ourse, all the fishermen his prey. The roof of the cavern is
supposed to have fallen in after the death of the giant, leaving the open
chasm as we now see it.</p>
