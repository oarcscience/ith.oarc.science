ST NEOT AND THE DOE.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;Again, on another day, when the hermit was in his fountain, a lovely doe,
flying from the huntsmen, fell down on the edge of the well, imploring, 'with
tearful eyes and anxious pantings, the aid of St Neot. The dogs followed in
full chase, ready to pounce on the trembling doe, and eager to tear her in
pieces. They saw the saint, and one look from his holy eyes sent them flying
back into the wood, more speedily, if possible, than they rushed out of it.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;The huntsman too came on, ready to discharge his arrow into the heart of
the doe; but, impressed with the sight he saw, he fell on his knees, cast away
his quiver, and became from that day a follower of the saint's, giving him his
horn to hang, as a memorial, in the church, where it was long to be seen. The
huntsman be&#173;came eventually one of the monks of the neighbouring house of St
Petroch.</p>
