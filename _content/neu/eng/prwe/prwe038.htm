<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE FAIRY REVELS ON THE &quot;GUMP&quot;, ST. JUST.</p>
<P><br>
LONG has the Gump been the reputed playground of the Small People. Many of the
good old people were permitted to witness their revels, and for years they
have delighted their grandchildren with tales of the songs they have heard,
and of the sights they have seen. To many of their friends those fairies have
given small but valuable presents; but woe to the man or woman who would dare
to intrude upon the ground occupied by them at the time of their high
festivals. There was a covetous old hunks in St Just--never mind his name, he
was severely punished, let that suffice--well, this old fellow had heard so
much of the riches displayed by the little people, when holding holiday on the
Gump, that he resolved to get some of the treasures. He learned all he could
learn from his neighbours, but kept his intention to himself. It was during
the harvest-moon--the night was a softened day--and everything abroad on
such a night should have been in harmony with its quiet brilliancy. But here
was a dark soul passing along, making a small eclipse with his black shadow.
The old man stole towards the rendezvous of the &quot;good people,&quot; as some were
fond of calling them, anxiously looking out for the treasures which he
coveted. At length, when he had not advanced far on the Gump, he heard music
of the most ravishing kind. Its influence was of a singularly mysterious
character. As the notes were solemn and slow, or quick and gay, the old man
was moved from tears to laughter; and on more than- one occasion he was
compelled to dance in obedience to the time. Notwithstanding that he was
almost bewildered by the whirling motion to which he was compelled, the old
man &quot;kept his wits awake,&quot; and waited his opportunity to seize some fairy
treasure; but as yet nothing remarkable had presented itself. The music
appeared to surround him, and, as he thought, to come closer to him than it
was at first; and although its sound led him to believe that the musicians
were on the surface, he was impressed with an idea that they were realty
beneath the earth Eventually there was a crash of sound, startling beyond
description, and the hill before him opened. All was now ablaze with
variously-coloured lights. Every blade of grass was hung with lamps, and every
furze bush was illuminated with stars Out from the opening in the hill marched
a host of spriggans, as if to clear the road. Then came an immense number of
musicians playing on every kind of instrument. These were followed by troop
after troop of soldiers, each troop bearing aloft their banner, which appeared
to spread itself, to display its blazonry, without the assistance of any
breeze. All these arranged themselves in order over the ground, some here and
some there. One thing was not at all to our friend's liking; several hundreds
of the most grotesque of the spriggans placed themselves so as to enclose the
spot on which he was standing. Yet, as they were none of them higher than his
shoe-tie, he thought he could &quot;squash&quot; them easily with his foot if they were
up to any mischief and so he consoled himself. This vast array having disposed
of themselves, first came a crowd of servants bearing vessels of silver and
vessels of gold, goblets cut out of diamonds, rubies, and other precious
stones. There were others laden, almost to overflowing, with the richest
meats, pastry, preserves, and fruits. Presently the ground was covered with
tables and everything was arranged in the most systematic order,--each party
failing back as they disposed of their burdens.</p>
<P>The brilliancy of the scene nearly overpowered the old man;
but, when he was least prepared for it, the illumination became a thousand
times more intense. Out of the hill were crowding thousands upon thousands of
lovely ladies and gentlemen, arrayed in the most costly attire. He thought
there would be no end to the coming crowd. By and by, however, the music
suddenly changed, and the harmonious sounds which fell upon his ears appeared
to give new life to every sense. His eyes were clearer, his ears quicker, and
his sense of smell more exquisite.</p>
<P>The odours of flowers, more delicious than any he had eves
smelt, filled the air. He saw, without any disturbing medium, the brilliant
beauty of the thousands of ladies who were now upon the Gump; and their voices
were united in one gush of song, which was clear as silver bells--a hymeneal
symphony of the utmost delicacy. The words were in a language unknown to him,
but he saw they were directed towards a new group now emerging from the hill.</p>
<P>First came a great number of female children clothed in the
whitest gauze, strewing flowers on the Gump. These were not dead or cut
flowers, for the moment they touched the ground they took root and grew. These
were followed by an equally large number of boys, holding in their hands
shells which appeared to be strung like harps, and from which they brought
forth murmurs of melody, such as angels only could hope to hear and live. Then
came--and there was no end to their coming--line upon line of little men
clothed in green and gold, and by and by a forest of banners, which, at a
signal, were all furled. Then, seated on thrones, carried upon a platform
above the heads of the men, came a young prince and princess who blazed with
beauty and jewels, as if they were suns amidst a skyey host of stars. There
was much ceremonial marching to and fro, but eventually the platform was
placed upon a mound on the Gump, which was now transformed into a hillock of
roses and lilies; and around this all the ladies and gentlemen walked, bowing,
and each one saying something to the princess and the prince,--passing onward
and taking their seats at the tables. Although no man could count the number
of this fairy host, there was no confusion; all the ladies and gentlemen
found, as if by instinct, their places. When all were seated, a signal was
given by the prince; servants in splendid liveries placed tables crowded with
gold-plate and good things on the platform, and every one, the prince and
princess included, began to feast with a will. Well, thought the old man, now
is my time; if I could only crawl up to the prince's table, I should have a
catch sure enough, and become a rich man for life. With his greedy mind fixed
on this one object, and unobservant of everything else, he crouched down, as
though by, so doing he could escape observation, and very slowly and
stealthily advanced amongst the revellers. He never saw that thousands of
spriggans had thrown little strings about him, and that they still held the
ends of the threads. The presence of this selfish old mortal did not in any
way discompose the assembly; they ate and drank and were as merry as though no
human eye was looking on them. The old man was wondrous cautious lest he
should disturb the feasters, consequently a long time was spent in getting, as
he desired, to the back of the mound. At length he reached the desired spot,
and, to his surprise, all was dark and gloomy behind him, but in front of the
mound all was a blaze of light. Crawling like a serpent on his belly,
trembling with anxiety, the old man advanced close to the prince and princess.
He was somewhat startled to find, as he looked out over the mound, that every
one of the thousands of eyes in that multitude was fixed on his. He gazed a
while, all the time screwing his courage up; then, as a boy who would catch a
butterfly, he took off his hat and carefully raised it, so as to cover the
prince, the princess, and their costly table, and, when about to close it upon
them, a shrill whistle was heard, the old man's hand was fixed powerless in
the air, and everything became dark around him.</p>
<P>Whir! whir! whir! as if a flight of bees were passing
him, buzzed in his ears. Every limb, from head to foot, was as if stuck full
of pins and pinched with tweezers. He could not move, he was changed to the
ground. By some means he had rolled down the mound, and lay on his back with
his arms outstretched, arms and legs being secured by magic chains to the
earth; therefore, although he suffered great agony, he could not stir, and,
strange enough, his tongue appeared tied by cords, so that he could not call.
He had lain, no one can tell how long, in this sad plight, when he felt as if
a number of insects were running over him, and by the light of the moon he saw
standing on his nose one of the spriggans, who looked exceedingly like a small
dragon-fly. This little monster stamped and jumped with great delight; and
having had his own fun upon the elevated piece of humanity, he laughed most
outrageously, and shouted, &quot;Away, away, I smell the day!&quot; Upon this the army
of small people, who had taken possession of the old man's body, moved quickly
away, and left our discomfited hero alone on the Gump. Bewildered, or, as he
said, bedevilled, he lay still to gather up his thoughts. At length the sun
arose, and then he found that he had been tied to the ground by myriads of
gossamer webs, which were now covered with dew, and glistened like diamonds in
the sunshine.</p>
<P>He shook himself, and was free. He rose wet, cold, and
ashamed. Sulkily he made his way to his home. It was a long time before,his
friends could learn from the old man where he had passed the night, but, by
slow degrees, they gathered the story I have related to you.</p>
