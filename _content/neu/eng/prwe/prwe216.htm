<P ALIGN="CENTER">SIR JOHN ARUNDELL.</p>
<P>IN the first year of the reign of Edward IV., the brave
Sir John Arundell dwelt on the north coast of Cornwall, at a place called
Efford, on the coast near Stratton. He was a magistrate, and greatly
esteemed amongst men for his honourable conduct. He had, however, in his
official capacity, given offence to a wild shepherd, who had by some means
acquired considerable influence over the minds of the people, under the
impression of his possessing some supernatural powers. This man had been
imprisoned by Arundell, and on his return home he constantly waylaid the
knight, and, always looking threateningly at him, slowly muttered,--</p>
<P>&quot;When upon the yellow sand,<br>
Thou shalt die by human hand.&quot;</p>
<P>Notwithstanding the bravery of Sir John Arundell, he was
not free from the superstitions of the period. He might, indeed, have been
impressed with the idea that this man intended to murder him. It is,
however, certain that he removed from Efford on the sands, to the wood-clad
hills of Trerice, and here he lived for some years without the annoyance of
meeting his old enemy. In the tenth year of Edward IV., Richard de Vere,
Earl of Oxford, seized St Michael's Mount. Sir John Arundell, then sheriff
of Cornwall, gathered together his own retainers and a large host of
volunteers, and led them to the attack on St Michael's Mount. The retainers
of the Earl of Oxford, on one occasion, left the castle, and made a sudden
rush upon Arundell's followers, who were encamped on the sands near
Marazion. Arundell then received his death-wound. Although he left Efford
&quot;to counteract the will of fate,&quot; the prophecy was fulfilled; and in his
dying moments, it is said his old enemy appeared, singing joyously,-- </p>
<P>&quot;When upon the yellow sand,<br>
Thou shalt die by human hand.&quot;</p>
