THE NINE MAIDS, OR VIRGIN SISTERS.

  
NINE "Moor Stones" are set up near the road in the parish of Gwendnon,
or Wendron, to which the above name is given. The perpendicular blocks
of granite have evidently been placed with much labour in their present
position. Tradition says they indicate the graves of nine sisters. Hals
appears to think some nuns were buried here. From one person only I
heard the old stony of the stones having been metamorphosed maidens.
Other groups of stone might be named, as Rosemedery, Tregaseal,
Boskednan, Botallack, Tredinek, and Crowlas, in the west, to which the
same story extends, and many others in the eastern parts of the county;
but it cannot be necessary.
