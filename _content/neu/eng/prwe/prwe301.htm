WEATHER SIGNS.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;THE WEATHER DOG--It frequently happens in
unsettled weather that banks of rain-cloud gather around the horizon, and
that, over isolated tracts, the rain falls. If these depositions from this low
stratum of clouds occur opposite to the sun, the lower limb of a bow is
formed, often appearing like a pillar of decom&#173;posed light; and sometimes two
of these coloured bands will be seen, forming indeed the two extremities of
the arch. These are "weather dogs," and they are regarded as certain
prognostications of showery or stormy weather. [a]</p>
<P>
&nbsp;The usual proverb with regard to the full bow,
which prevails generally, is common in Cornwall--</p>
<P>
&nbsp;"The rainbow in the morning<br>
Is the shepherd's warning; <br>
The rainbow at night<br>
Is the shepherd's delight."</p>
<P>
But, as far as I know, the "weather dog" is
peculiarly Cornish,</p>
<P>
[a]&nbsp;
"There appeared in the northeast the frustrum of a large rainbow; all the
colour, were lively and distinct, and it was three times as wide as the arch
of an ordinary complete rainbow, but no higher than it was wide. They call it
here, in Cornwall, <i>a</i> <i>weather
dog;</i> but in the Cornish language, Lagas-auel,--that is, the weather's
eye,--and pronounced it a certain sign of hard rain."--<i>Borlase's Natural
History of Cornwall.</i></p>
