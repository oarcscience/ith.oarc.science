THE MEN-AN-TOL

  
NOT more than two miles from Penzance stands the celebrated cromlech of
Lanyon -- often pronounced Lanine. This, like all the other cromlechs,
marks, no doubt, the resting-place of a British chieftain, many of whose
followers repose within a short

distance of this, the principal monument.

Beyond the village of Lanyon, on a "furzy down," stands the Mên-an-tol,
or the "holed stone." For some purpose--it is in vain to speculate on it
now--the bardic priesthood employed this stone, and probably the
superstition which attaches to it may indicate its ancient uses.

If scrofulous children are passed naked through the Men-an-tol three
times, and then drawn on the grass three times against the sun, it is
felt by the faithful that much has been done towards insuring a speedy
cure. Even men and women who have been afflicted with spinal diseases,
or who have suffered from scrofulous taint, have been drawn through this
magic stone, which all declare still retains its ancient virtues.

If two brass pins are carefully laid across each other on the top edge
of this stone, any question put to the rock will be answered, by the
pins acquiring, through some unknown agency, a peculiar motion.
