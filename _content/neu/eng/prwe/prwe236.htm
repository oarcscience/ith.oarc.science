THE GAME OF HURLING.</p>
<P>THE
game of " Hurling"&nbsp; was, until a recent period, played in the
parishes to the west of Penzance on the Sunday afternoon. The game was
usually between two parishes, sometimes between Burian and Sancreed, or
against St Leven and Sennen, or the higher side of the parish played
against the lower side.</p>
<P>The run was from Burian Cross in the Church-town, to
the Pipers in Boloeit. All the gentry from the surrounding parishes would
meet at Boloeit to see the ball brought in.</p>
<P>&quot;Hurling matches&quot; are peculiar to Cornwall. They are
trials of skill between two parties, consisting of a considerable number
of men, forty to sixty a side, and often between two parishes. These
exercises have their name from &quot;hurling&quot; a wooden ball, about three inches
in diameter, covered with a plate of silver, which is sometimes gilt, and
has commonly a motto, &quot; Gware wheag yeo gware teag,&quot; &quot;Fair play is good
play.&quot; The success depends on catching the ball dexterously when thrown
up, or <i>dealt, </i>and carrying it off expeditiously, in spite of all
opposition from the adverse party; or, if that be impossible, throwing it
into the hands of a partner, who in his turn, exerts his efforts to convey
it to his own goal, which is often three or four miles' distance. This
sport, therefore, requires a nimble hand, a quick eye, a swift foot, and
skill in wrestling; as well as strength, good wind, and lungs. Formerly it
was practised annually by those who attended corporate bodies in surveying
the bounds of parishes; but from the many accidents that usually attended
that game, it is now scarcely ever practised. Silver prizes used to be
awarded to the victor in the games. A correspondent at St Ives writes :--
</p>
<P>HURLING THE SILVER BALL--This old custom is still
observed at St Ives. The custom is also kept up at St Colomb and St
Blazey, on the anniversary of the dedication of the church. St Ives Feast
is governed by the Candlemas-day, it being the nearest Sunday next before
that day. On the Monday after, the inhabitants assemble on the beach, when
the ball, which is left in the custody of the mayor for the time being, is
thrown from the churchyard to the crowd. The sides are formed in this way,
--</p>
<P>Toms, Wills, and Jans,<br>
Take off all's on the san's--</p>
<P>that is, all those of the name of Thomas, John, or
William are ranged on one side, those of any other <i>Christian </i>name
on the other; of late years the odd names outnumbered the Toms, Wills, and
Jans. There is a pole erected on the beach, and each side strives to get
the oftenest at the &quot;goold,&quot; <i>i.e., </i>the pole the other side as
manfully striving to keep them out, and to send their opponents as great a
distance from the pole as possible. The tradition is, that the contest
used to be between the parishes of Ludgvan, Lelant, audi St Ives,--St
lves, then being part of the <i>living </i>of Ludgvan,--and that they
used to have a friendly hurling at Ludgvan, and that afterwards the
contest was between Lelant and St Ives. A stone near to Captain Perry's
house is, shown, where the two parishes used to meet at the feast, and the
struggle' was to throw the ball into the parish church, the successful
party keeping the ball, the unsuccessful buying a new one. St Ives is said
to have out. numbered the Lelant folks, so that they gave up the contest,
and the ball was left with St Ives. Thus much is certain--that the feasts
of St lves, Lelant, and Ludgvan fall properly on one Sunday, though a
misunderstanding has arisen, Lelant claiming to be governed by the day
before Candlemas-day,. which will alter the three every seven years.</p>
<P>The game of hurling is now but rarely played, and the
Sabbath is never broken by that or by any other game.</p>
