THE CRICK STONE IN MORVA.

  
 

IF any one suffering from a "crick in the back" can pass through this
forked rock, on the borders of Zennor and Morva, without touching the
stone, he is certain of being cured. This is but a substitute for the
holed stone, which, it is admitted, has much more virtue than the forked
stone.

In various parts of the county there are, amongst the granitic masses,
rocks which have fallen across each other, leaving small openings, or
there are holes, low and narrow, extending under a pile of rocks. In
nearly every case of this kind, we find it is popularly stated, that any
one suffering from rheumatism or lumbago would be cured if he crawled
through the openings. In some cases, nine times are insisted on "to make
the charm complete."

Mrs Bray, in her "Traditions of Devonshire," gives several examples of
the prevalence of this superstition over the granitic district of
Dartmoor. \[a\]

\[a\] "Creeping under tolmens for the cure of diseases is still
practised in Ireland, and also in the East, as is shown by Mrs Colonel
Elwood In her Trayels."--Gentlemen's Magazine, July 1831.
