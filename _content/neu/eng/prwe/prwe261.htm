<P ALIGN="CENTER">A TEST OF INNOCENCY</p>
<P>
&nbsp;A FARMER in Towednack having been robbed of some property of
no great value, was resolved nevertheless, to employ a test which he had
heard the &quot;old people&quot; resorted to for the purpose of catching the thief.
He invited all his neighbours into his cottage, and when they were
assembled, he placed a cock under the &quot;brandice,&quot; (an iron vessel formerly
much employed by the peasantry in baking, when this process was carried
out on the hearth, the fuel being furze and ferns). Every one was directed
to touch the brandice with his, or her, third finger, and say, &quot;In the
name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, speak.&quot; Every one did as they
were directed, and no sound came from beneath the brandice. The last
person was a woman, who occasionally laboured for the farmer in his
fields. She hung back, hoping to pass unobserved amidst the crowd. But her
very anxiety made her a suspected person. She was forced forward, and most
unwillingly she touched the brandice, when, before she could utter the
words prescribed, the cock crew. The woman fell faint on the floor, and,
when she recovered, she confessed herself to be the thief, restored the
stolen property, and became, it is said, &quot;a changed character from that
day.&quot;</p>
