<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE FAIRY FAIR IN GERMOE.</p>
<P><br>
BAL LANE in Germoe was a notorious place for piskies. One night Daniel
Champion and his comrade came to Godolphin Bridge,--they were a little bit
&quot;overtook&quot; with liquor. They said that when they came to &quot;Bal Lane,&quot; they
found it covered all over from end to end, and the Small People holding a fair
there with all sorts of merchandise--the prettiest sight they ever met with.
Champion was sure he saw his child there; for a few nights before, his child
in the evening was as beautiful a one as could be seen anywhere, but in the
morning was changed for one as ugly and wizened as could be; and he was sure
the Small People had done it. Next day, telling the story at Croft Gothal, his
comrade was knocked backward, thrown into the bob-pit, and just killed.
Obliged to be carried to his home, Champion followed, and was telling of their
adventure with the Small People, when one said, &quot;Don't speak about them; they
're wicked, spiteful devils.&quot; No sooner were the words uttered than the
speaker was thrown clean over stairs and bruised dreadfully,--a convincing
proof to all present of the reality of the existence of the Small Folks.</p>
