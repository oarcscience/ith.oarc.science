THE DEVIL'S DOORWAY.</p>
<P><br>
IN the slate (Killas) formations behind Polperro is a good example of a <i>
fault</i>. The geologist, in the pride of his know&#173;ledge, refers this to some
movement of the solid mass--a rending of the rocks, produced either by the
action of some subterranean force lifting the earth-crust, or by a depression
of one division of the rocks. The gray-bearded wisdom of our grandfathers led
them to a conclusion widely different from this.</p>
<P>
The mighty ruler of the realms of darkness, who
is known to have an especial fondness for rides at midnight, "to see how his
little ones thrive," ascending from his subterranean country, chose this spot as
his point of egress.</p>
<P>
As he rose from below in his fiery car, drawn by
a gigantic jet black steed, the rocks gave way before him, and the rent at
Pol&#173;perro remains to this day to convince all unbelievers. Not only this, as his
Satanic majesty burst through the slate rocks, his horse, delighted with the
airs of this upper world, reared in wild triumph, and, planting again his hoof
upon the ground, made these islands shake as with an earthquake; and he left the
deep impres&#173;sion of his burning foot behind. There, any unbeliever may see the
hoof-shaped pool, unmistakable evidence of the wisdom of the days gone by.</p>
