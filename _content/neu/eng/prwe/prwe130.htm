<P ALIGN="CENTER">ST KEA'S BOAT.</p>
<P>ST KEA, a young Irish saint, stood on the southern shores
of Ireland and saw the Christian missionaries departing to carry the blessed
Word to the heathens of Western England. He watched their barks fade beneath
the horizon, and he felt that he was left to a solitude which was not fitted
to one in the full energy of young life, and burning with zeal.</p>
<P>The saint knelt on a boulder of granite lying on the
shore, and he prayed with fervour that Heaven would order it so that he
might diffuse his religious fervour amongst the barbarians of Cornwall, He
prayed on for some time, not observing the rising of the tide. When he had
poured out his full soul, he awoke to the fact, not only that the waves were
washing around the stone on which he knelt, but that the stone was actually
floating on the water. Impressed with the miracle, St Kea sprang to his
feet, and looking towards the setting sun, with his cross uplifted, he
exclaimed, &quot;To Thee, and only to Thee, my God, do I trust my soul !&quot;</p>
<P>Onward floated the granite, rendered buoyant by
supernatural power. Floated hither and thither by the tides, it swam on;
blown sometimes in one direction, and sometimes in another, by the varying
winds, days and nights were spent upon the waters. The faith of St Kea
failed not; three times a day he knelt in prayer to God. At all other times
he stood gazing on the heavens. At length the faith of the saint being
fairly tried, the moorstone boat floated steadily up the river, and landed
at St Kea, which place he soon Christianised; and there stands to this day
this monument of St Kea's sincere belief.</p>
