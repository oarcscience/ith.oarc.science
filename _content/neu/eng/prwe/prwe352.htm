<P ALIGN="CENTER">MILLINGTON OF PENGERSWICK</p>
<P>IN the reign of Henry VIII., one Militon, or
Millington, appears to have purchased Pengerswick Castle. This
Millington is said to have retired into the solitude of this place on
account of a murder which he had committed. (Mr. Wilkie Collins appears
to have founded his novel of &quot;Basil&quot; on this tradition.) In all
probability a very much older story is adapted to Mr. Millington. So far
from his being a recluse, we learn of his purchasing St. Michael's
Mount, &quot;whose six daughters and heirs invested their husbands and
purchasers therewith.&quot;</p>
<P>That Millington was a man of wealth, and that
large possessions were held by his family, is sufficiently evident.
St. Michael's Mount appears to have been &quot;granted at first for a
term of years to different gentlemen of the neighbourhood. To
Millington, supposed of Pengerswick, in Breage; to Harris, of
Kenegie, in Gulval; and, perhaps jointly with Millington, to a
Billett or Bennett.&quot;--<i>Hals</i>.</p>
