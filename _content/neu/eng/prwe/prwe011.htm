<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE GIANT OF NANCLEDRY.[a]</p>
<P><br>
IN Nancledry Bottoms, about a mile from the famous hill Castle-an-Dinas, there
stood at one time a thatched house near the brook which runs murmuring down
the valley. Rather more than thirty years since, some mouldering &quot;clob&quot; (mud)
walls, indicating the existence at one time of a large dwelling, were pointed
to as the former residence of a terrible giant. He appears to have led a
solitary life, and to have lived principally on little children, whom he is
said to have swallowed whole. His strength was indicated by several huge
masses of granite which were scattered around the Bottoms, and in the
neighbouring fields. These were carried by him in his pockets, to defend
himself from the giants of Trecrobben, with whom he appears to have been on
unfriendly terms. This giant is noteworthy as the only one recorded who lived
in a house.</p>
