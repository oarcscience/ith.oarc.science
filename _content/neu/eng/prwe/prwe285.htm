<P>
&nbsp;&quot;THEY that wash Monday got all the week to dry, <br>
They that wash Tuesday are pretty near by,<br>
They that wash Wednesday make a good housewife,<br>
They that wash Thursday must wash for their life,<br>
They that wash Friday must wash in need,<br>
They that wash Saturday are sluts indeed.&quot;</p>
