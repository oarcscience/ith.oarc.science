<P>&quot;Hengsten Down, well ywrought,<br>
Is worth London town dear ybought.&quot;<br>
<i>CAREW--Lord De Dunstanvlle's Edition.</p>
</i>
<P>IT may be worthy of consideration whether we have not
evidence in this distich of the extent to which mining operations were
carried on over this moorland and the adjoining country by the ancient
Cornish miners.</p>
<P>It is said that this moorland was originally Hengiston; and
tradition affirms that the name preserves the memory of a severe contest,
when the Welsh joined Egbright, a king of the West Saxons, and defeated the
host of Danes, who had come over to &quot;West Wales,&quot; meaning thereby Cornwall.
On this waste Hengist had his fenced camp, and here the Cornish and the
Welsh attacked and entirely overthrew him. It is evident, if tradition is to
be believed, that the struggle was to gain possession of a valuable tin
ground.</p>
