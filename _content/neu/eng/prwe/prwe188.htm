<P>
"To us our Queen, who, in the central earth,<BR>
Midst fiery lavas or basaltine seas,<BR>
Deep-throned the illimitable waste enjoys,<BR>
Enormous solitude, has given these<BR>
Her subterraneous realms; bids us dwell here,<BR>
In the abyss of darkness, and exert<BR>
Immortal alchymy."</P>
<P>"Each devious cleft, each secret cell explore, <BR>
And from its fissures draw the ductile ore."</P>
<P><I>The Mine: a Dramatic Poem</I>--JOHN SARGENT</P>
<P>&quot;An ancient story I 'll tell you anon,<br>
Which is older by far than the days of King John;<br>
But this you should know, that that red-robed sinner<br>
Robb'd the Jew of the gold he had made as a tinner.&quot;<br>
<i>Old Cornish Song.</p>
</i>
<P>THERE is scarcely a spot in Cornwall where tin is at present
found, that has not been worked over by the &quot;old men,&quot; as the ancient miners
are always called.</p>
<P>Every valley has been &quot;streamed &quot;--that is, the deposits have
been washed for tin; over every hill where now a tin mine appears, there are
evidences, many of them most extensive, of actual mining operations having
been carried on to as great a depth as was possible in the days when the
appliances of science were unknown.</p>
<P>Wherever the &quot;streamer&quot; has been, upon whatever spot the old
miner has worked, there we are told the &quot;Finician&quot; <i>(Phoeniclan) </i>has
been, or the Jew has mined. [a]</p>
<P>There is much confusion in these traditions. The Jew, and
the Saracen, and the Phoenician are regarded as terms applied to the same
people. Whereas the Phoenicians, who are recorded to have traded with the
Cornish Britons for tin, and the Jews, who were the great tin miners and
merchants in the days of King John, are separated by wide periods of time;
and the &quot;Saracens,&quot; whom some suppose to have been miners who came from
Spain when that country was under the dominion of the Moors, occupy a very
undefined position. Tradition, however, tells us that the old Cornish miners
shipped their tin at several remarkable islands round the coast. St Michael's Mount has been especially
noticed, but this arises from the circumstance that it still retains the
peculiar character which it appears to have possessed when Diodorus wrote.
But Looe Island, St Nicholas's Island in Plymouth Sound, the island at St
Ives, the Chapel Rock at Perran, and many other insular masses of rock,
which are at but a short distance from the coast, are said to have been
shipping-places.</p>
<P>Tradition informs us that the Christian churches upon
Dartmoor, which are said to have been built about the reign of John, were
reared by the Jews. Once, and once only, I heard the story told in more
detail. They, the Jews, did not actually work in the tin streams and mines
of the Moor, but they employed tinners, who were Christians; and the king
imposed on the Jew merchants the condition that they should build churches
for their miners.</p>
<P>That the Phoenicians came to Cornwall to buy tin has been so
often told that there is little to be added to the story. It was certainly
new, however, to be informed by the miners in Gwennap--that there could be
no shade of doubt but that St Paul himself casne to Cornwall to buy tin, and
that Creekbraws--a mine still in existence--supplied the saint largely
with that valuable mineral, Gwennap is regarded by Gwennap men as the centre
of Christianity. This feeling has been kept alive by the annual meeting of
the Wesleyan body in Gwennap Pit--an old mine-working--on Whitmonday. This
high estate and privilege is due, says tradition, to the fact that St Paul
himself preached in the parish. [b]</p>
<P>I have also been told that St Paul preached to the tinners
on Dartmoor, and a certain cross on the road from Plympton to Princes-Town
has been indicated as the spot upon which the saint stood to enlighten the
benighted miners of this wild region. Of St Piran Or Perran we have already
spoken as the patron saint of the tinners, and of the discovery of tin a
story has been told; and we have already intimated that another saint, whose
name alone is preserved, St Picrous, has his feast-day amongst the tinners
of eastern Cornwall, on the second Thursday before Christmas.</p>
<P>Amidst the giant stories we have the very remarkable Jack
the Tinker, who is clearly indicated as introducing the knowledge of tin, or
of the dressing of tin, to the Cornish. This is another version of Wayland
Smith, the blacksmith of Berkshire. The blacksmith of the Berkshire legend
reappears in a slightly altered character in Jack the Tinker. In Camden's &quot;Britannia&quot; we
read, relative to Ashdown, in Berkshire - </p>
<P>&quot;The burial-place of Baereg, the Danish chief who was slain
in this fight (the fight between Alfred and the Danes), is distinguished by
a parcel of stones, less than a mile from the bill, set on edge, enclosing a
piece of ground somewhat raised. On the east side of the southern extremity
stand three squarish fiat stones, of about four or five feet over either
way, supporting a fourth, and now called by the vulgar, WAYLAND SMITH, from
an idle tradition about an invisible smith replacing lost horse-shoes
there.&quot;--<i>Gough's Camden.</p>
</i>
<P>See &quot;Kenilworth,&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, who has appropriated
Wayland Smith with excellent effect.</p>
<P>&quot;The Berkshire legend of Wayland Smith ('Wayland Smith,' by
W.S. Singer) is probably but a prototype of Daedalus, Tubal Cain, <i>
&amp;c.&quot;--Wilson's Prehistoric Annals of Scotland.</p>
</i>
<P>See also Mr Thomas Wright's Essay on Wayland Smith.</p>
<P>The existence of the terms &quot;Jews' houses,&quot; &quot;Jews' tin,&quot;
&quot;Jews' leavings,&quot; or &quot;attall,&quot; and &quot;attall Saracen,&quot; prove the connection of
strangers with the Cornish tin mines. The inquiry is too large to be entered
on here. I reserve it for another and more fitting place. I may, however,
remark in passing, that I have no doubt the Romans were active miners during
the period of their possession; and many relics which have been found and
ascribed to the Britons are undoubtedly Roman. See further remarks on &quot;Who
are the Knockers ?&quot;</p>
<P>Mr Edmonds supposes that he found in a bronze vessel
discovered near Marazion a caldron in which tin was refined. In the first
place, a bronze vessel would never have been used for that purpose--
chemical laws are against it; and in the second place, it is more than
doubtful if ever the &quot;Jews' tin&quot; was subjected to this process. In all
probability, the bronze vessel discovered was a &quot;Roman camp-kettle.&quot; A very
full description of bronze caidrons of this description will be found in
&quot;The Archaeology and Prehistoric Annals of Scotland,&quot; by Daniel Wilson, p.
274.</p>
<P>It may not be out of place to insert here the tradition of ~
very important application of this metal.</p>
<P>The use of tin as a mordant, for which very large quantities
are now used, is said to have been thus discovered :-- </p>
<P>Mr Crutchy, Bankside, married a Scotchwoman. This lady often
told her husband that his scarlet was not equal to one she could dye. He set
her to work. She dyed a skein of worsted in a saucepan, using the same
material as her husband, but produced a better colour. She did not know this
was owing to the saucepan's being tinned, but he detected the fact, and made
his fortune as a dyer of scarlet and Turkey-red. The most important
Turkey-red dye-works are even now in the neighbourhood of Lochlomond;
therefore, this Scotchwoman may have been better acquainted with the process
than the story tells.</p>
<P>[a] &quot;They maintaine these works to have been verie auncient,
and first wrought by the <i>Jewes </i>with Pickaxes of Holme-Boxe and
Hartshorne. They prove this ly the name of those places yet enduring, to
wit, <i>Attoll Sarazin, </i>in English, the <i>Jewes Offcast, </i>and by
those tooles daily found amongst the rubble of such <i>workes.&quot;--Survey of
Cornwall. Carew. </i>(Appendix, AA.)</p>
<P>[b] Is this supported by the statement of Dr Stillingfleet,
Bishop of Worcester, who says &quot;The Christian religion was planted in the
Island of Great Britain during the time of the apostles, and probably by St
Paul&quot; ?</p>
