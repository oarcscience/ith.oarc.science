<P ALIGN="CENTER">TREADING ON GRAVES</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>&quot;To see a man tread over graves,<br>
I hold it no good mark;<br>
'Tis wicked in the sun and moon,<br>
And bad luck in the dark!&quot;</p>
<P>So sings Coleridge in his ballad of &quot;The Three Graves.&quot;</p>
<P>Whenever a person shivers from a sensation of cold down the
spine, it is said some one is walking over his or her grave.</p>
<P>Persons believing this, will give directions that they may be
buried in some secluded corner of the churchyard, so that their corpse may not
be disturbed by unholy footsteps.</p>
