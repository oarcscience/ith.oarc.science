<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SPRIGGANS OF TRENCROM HILL.</p>
<P><br>
IT is not many years since a man, who thought he was fully informed as to the
spot in which a crock of the giant's gold was buried, proceeded on one fine
moonlight night to this enchanted hill, and with spade and pick commenced his
search. He proceeded for some time without interruption, and it became evident
to him that the treasure was not far off. The sky was rapidly covered with the
darkest clouds, shutting out the brilliant light o the moon--which had
previously gemmed each cairn--and leaving the gold-seeker in total and
unearthly darkness. The wind rose, and roared terrifically amidst the rocks;
but this was soon drowned amidst the fearful crashes of thunder, which
followed in quick succession the flashes of lightning. By its light the man
perceived that the spriggans were coming out in swarms from all the rocks.
They were in countless numbers; and although they were small at first, they
rapidly increased in size, until eventually they assumed an almost giant form,
looking all the while, as he afterwards said, &quot;as ugly as if they would eat
him.&quot; How this poor man escaped is unknown, but he is said to have been so
frightened that he took to his bed, and was not able to work for a long time.</p>
