<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE DEMON TREGEAGLE.</p>
<P> "In Cornwaile's fair land, bye the poole on the moore.<br>
Tregeagle the wicked did dwell."<br>
--Tregeagle; or Dozmare Pool.<br>
by John Penwarne
</P>
<P>&quot;Thrice he began to tell his doleful tale,<br>
And thrice the sighs did swallow up his voice.&quot;<br>
- Thomas Sackville</p>
<P>WHO has not heard of the wild spirit Tregeagle? He haunts
equally the moor, the rocky coasts, and the blown sand-hills of Cornwall. From
north to south, from east to west, this doomed spirit is heard of, and to the
day of judgment he is doomed to wander, pursued by avenging fiends. For ever
endeavouring to perform some task by which he hopes to secure repose, and
being for ever defeated. Who has not heard the howling of Tregeagle? When the
storms come with all their strength from the Atlantic, and urge themselves
upon the rocks around the Land's End, the howls of the spirit are louder than
the roaring of the winds. When calms rest upon the ocean, and the waves can
scarcely form upon the resting waters, low wailings creep along the coast.
These are the wailings of this wandering soul. When midnight is on the moor or
on the mountains, and the night winds whistle amidst the rugged cairns, the
shrieks of Tregeagle are distinctly heard. We know, then, that he is pursued
by the demon dogs, and that till daybreak he must fly with all speed before
them. The voice of Tregeagle is everywhere, and yet he is unseen by human eye.
Every reader will at once perceive that Tregeagle belongs to the mythologies
of the oldest nations, and that the traditions of this wandering spirit in
Cornwall, which centre upon one tyrannical magistrate, are but the
appropriation of stories which belong to every age and country. Tradition thus
tells Tregeagle's tale.</p>
<P>There are some men who appear to be from their births given
over to the will of tormenting demons. Such a man was Tregeagle. He is as old
as the hills, yet there are many circumstances in the story of his life which
<i>appear</i> to remove him from this remote antiquity. Modern legends assert
him to belong to comparatively modern times, and say that, without doubt, he
was one of the Tregeagles who once owned Trevorder near Bodmin. We have not,
however, much occasion to trouble ourselves with the man or his life; it is
with the death and the subsequent existence of a myth that we are concerned.</p>
<P>Certain it is that the man Tregeagle was diabolically
wicked. He seems to have been urged on from one crime to another until the cup
of sin was overflowing.</p>
<P>Tregeagle was wealthy beyond most men of his time, and his
wealth purchased for him that immunity, which the Church, in her degenerate
days, too often accorded to those who could aid, with their gold or power, the
sensual priesthood. As a magistrate, he was tyrannical and unjust, and many an
innocent man was wantonly sacrificed by him for the purpose of hiding his own
dark deeds. As a landlord, he was rapacious and unscrupulous, and frequently
so involved his tenants in his toils, that they could not escape his grasp.
The stain of secret murder clings to his memory, and he is said to have
sacrificed a sister whose goodness stood between him and his demon passions;
his wife and children perished victims to his cruelties. At length death drew
near to relieve the land of a monster whose name was a terror to all who heard
it. Devils waited to secure the soul they had won, and Tregeagle in terror
gave to the priesthood wealth, that they might fight with them and save his
soul from eternal fire. Desperate was the struggle, but the powerful exorcisms
of the banded brotherhood of a neighbouring monastery, drove back the evil
ones, and Tregeagle - slept with his fathers, safe in the custody of the
churchmen, who buried him with high honours in St Breock Church. They sang
chants and read prayers above his grave, to secure the soul which they thought
they had saved. But Tregeagle was not fated to rest. Satan desired still to
gain possession of such a gigantic sinner, and we can only refer what ensued
to the influence of the wicked spiritings of his ministers.</p>
<P>A dispute arose between two wealthy families respecting the
ownership of extensive lands around Bodmin. The question had been rendered
more difficult by the nefarious conduct of Tregeagle, who had acted as steward
to one of the claimants, and who had destroyed ancient deeds, forged others,
and indeed made it appear that he was the real proprietor of the domain. Large
portions of the land Tregeagle had sold, and other parts were leased upon long
terms, he having received all the money and appropriated it. His death led to
inquiries, and then the transactions were gradually brought to light.
Involving, as this did, large sums of money--and indeed it was a question
upon which turned the future well-doing or ruin of a family--it was fought by
the lawyers with great pertinacity. The legal questions had been argued
several times before the judges at the assizes. The trials had been deferred,
new trials had been sought for and granted, and every possible plan known to
the lawyers for postponing the settlement of a suit had been tried. A day was
at length fixed, upon which a final decision must be come to, and a special
jury was sworn to administer justice between the contending parties. Witnesses
innumerable were examined as to the validity of a certain deed, and the
balance of evidence was equally suspended. The judge was about to sum up the
case and refer the question to the jury, when the defendant in the case,
coming into court, proclaimed aloud that he had yet another witness to
produce. There was a strange silence in the judgment-hall. It was felt that
something chilling to the soul was amongst them, and there was a simultaneous
throb of terror as Tregeagle was led into the witness-box.</p>
<P>When the awe-struck assembly had recovered, the lawyers for
the defendant commenced their examination, which was long and terrible. The
result, however, was the disclosure of an involved system of fraud, of which
the honest defendant had been the victim, and the jury unhesitatingly gave a
verdict in his favour.</p>
<P>The trial over, every one expected to see the
spectre-witness removed. There, however, he stood, powerless to fly, although
he evidently desired to do so. Spirits of darkness were waiting to bear him
away, but some spell of holiness prevented them from touching him. There was a
struggle with the good and the evil angels for this sinner's soul, and the
assembled court appeared frozen with horror. At length the judge with dignity
commanded the defendant to remove his witness.</p>
<P>&quot;To bring him from the grave has been to me so dreadful a
task, that I leave him to your care, and that of the Prior's, by whom he was
so beloved.&quot; Having said this, the defendant left the court.</p>
<P>The churchmen were called in, and long were the
deliberations between them and the lawyers, as to the best mode of disposing
of Tregeagle.</p>
<P>They could resign him to the devil at once, but by long
trial the worst of crimes might be absolved, and as good churchmen they could
not sacrifice a human soul. The only thing was to give the spirit some task,
difficult beyond the power of human nature, which might be extended far into
eternity. Time might thus gradually soften the obdurate soul, which still
retained all the black dyes of the sins done in the flesh, that by infinitely
slow degrees repentance might exert its softening power. The spell therefore
put upon Tregeagle was, that as long as he was employed on some endless
assigned task, there should be hope of salvation, and that he should be secure
from the assaults of the devil as long as he laboured steadily. A moment's
rest was fatal-- labour unresting, and for ever, was his doom.</p>
<P>One of the lawyers, remembering that Dosmery Pool [a] was
bottomless, and that a thorn-bush which had been flung into it, but a few
weeks before, had made its appearance in Falmouth Harbour, proposed that
Tregeagle might be employed to empty this profound lake. Then one of the
churchmen, to make the task yet more enduring, proposed that it should be
performed by the aid of a limpet-shell having a hole in it.</p>
<P>This was agreed to, and the required incantations were duly
made. Bound by mystical spells, Tregeagle was removed to the dark moors and
duly set to work. Year after year passed by, and there, day and night, summer
and winter, storm and shine, Tregeagle was bending over the dark water,
working hard with his perforated shell; yet the pool remained at the same
level.</p>
<P>His old enemy the devil kept a careful eye on the doomed
one, resolving, if possible, to secure so choice an example of evil. Often did
he raise tempests sufficiently wild, as he supposed, to drive Tregeagle from
his work, knowing that if he failed for a season to labour, he could seize and
secure him. These were long tried in vain; but at length an auspicious hour
presented itself.</p>
<P>Nature was at war with herself, the elements had lost their
balance, and there was a terrific struggle to recover it. Light-flings flashed
and coiled like fiery snakes around the rocks of Roughtor. Fire-balls fell on
the desert moors and hissed in the accursed lake. Thunders peeled through the
heavens, and echoed from hill to hill; an earthquake shook the solid earth,
and terror was on all living. The winds arose and raged with a fury which was
irresistible, and hail beat so mercilessly on all things, that it spread death
around. Long did Tregeagle stand the &quot;pelting of the pitiless storm,&quot; but at
length he yielded to its force and fled. The demons in crowds were at his
heels. He doubled, however, on his pursuers, and returned to the lake; but so
rapid were they, that he could not rest the required moment to dip his shell
in the flow seething waters.</p>
<P>Three times he fled round the lake, and the evil ones
pursued him. Then, feeling that there was no safety for him near Dosmery Pool,
he sprang swifter than the wind across it, shrieking with agony, and thus, --
since the devils cannot cross water, and were obliged to go round the lake, --
he gained on them and fled over the moor.</p>
<P>Away, away went Tregeagle, faster and faster the dark
spirits pursuing, and they had nearly overtaken him, when he saw Roach Rock
and its chapel before him. He rushed up the rocks, with giant power clambered
to the eastern window, and dashed his head through it, thus securing the
shelter of its sanctity. The defeated demons retired, and long and loud were
their wild wailings in the air. The inhabitants of the moors and of the
neighbouring towns slept not a Wink that night.</p>
<P>Tregeagle was safe, his head was within the holy church,
though his body was exposed on a bare rock to the storm. Earnest were the
prayers of the blessed hermit in his cell on the rock to be relieved from his
nocturnal and sinful visitor.</p>
<P>In vain were the recluse's prayers. Day after day, as he
knelt at the altar, the ghastly head of the doomed sinner grinned horridly
down upon him. Every holy ejaculation fell upon Tregeagle's ear like molten
iron. He writhed and shrieked under the torture; but legions of devils filled
the air, ready to seize him, if for a moment he withdrew his head from the
sanctuary, Sabbath after Sabbath the little chapel on the rock was rendered a
scene of sad confusion by the interruptions which Tregeagle caused. Men
trembled with fear at his agonising cries, and women swooned. At length the
place was deserted, and even the saint of the rock was wasting to death by the
constant perturbation in which he was kept by the unholy spirit, and the
demons who, like carrion birds, swarmed around the holy cairn. Things could
not go on thus. The monks of Bodmin and the priests from the neighbouring
churches gathered together, and the result of their long and anxious
deliberations was, that Tregeagle, guarded by two saints, should be taken to
the north coast, near Padstow, and employed in making trusses of sand, and
ropes of sand with which to bind them. By powerful spell, Tregeagle was
removed from Roach, and fixed upon the sandy shores of the Padstow district.
Sinners are seldom permitted to enjoy any peace of soul. As the ball of sand
grew into form, the tides rose, and the breakers spread out the sands again a
level sheet; again was it packed together and again washed away.--Toil! toil
! toil! day and night unrestingly, sand on sand grew with each hour, and
ruthlessly the ball was swept, by one blow of a sea wave, along the shore.</p>
<P>The cries of Tregeagle were dreadful; and as the
destruction of the sand heap was constantly recurring, a constantly increasing
despair gained the mastery over hope, and the ravings of the baffled soul were
louder than the roarings of the winter tempest.</p>
<P>Baffled in making trusses of sand, Tregeagle seized upon
the loose particles and began to spin them into a rope. Long and patiently did
he pursue his task, and hope once more rose like a star out of the midnight
darkness of despair. A rope was forming, when a storm came up with all its
fury from the Atlantic, and swept the particles of sand away over the hills.</p>
<P>The inhabitants of Padstow had seldom any rest. At every
tide the howlings of Tregeagle banished sleep from each eye. But now so
fearful were the sounds of the doomed soul,: in the madness of the struggle
between hope and despair, that the people fled the town, and clustered upon
the neighbouring plains, praying, as with one voice, to be relieved from the
sad presence of this monster.</p>
<P>St Petroc, moved by the tears and petitions of the people,
resolved to remove the spirit; and by the intense earnestness of his prayers,
after long wrestling, he subdued Tregeagle to his will. Having chained him
with the bonds which the saint had forged with his own hands, every link of
which had been welded with a prayer, St Petroc led the spirit away from the
north coast, and stealthily placed him on the southern shores.</p>
<P>In those days Ella's Town, now Helston, was a flourishing
port. Ships sailed into the estuary, up to the town, and they brought all
sorts of merchandise, and returned with cargoes of tin from the mines of
Breage and Wendron.</p>
<P>The wily monk placed his charfe at Bareppa, and there
condemned him to carry sacks of sand across the estuary of the Loo, and to
empty them at Porthleven, until the beach was clean down to the rocks. The
priest was a good observer. He knew that the sweep of the tide was from
Trewavas Head round the coast towards the Lizard, and that the sand would be
carried back steadily and speedily as fast as the spirit could remove it.</p>
<P>Long did Tregeagle labour; and, of course, in vain. His
struggles were giant-like to perform his task, but he saw the sands return as
regularly as he removed them. The sufferings of the poor fishermen who
inhabited the coast around Porthleven were great. As the howlings of Tregeagle
disturbed the dwellers in Padstow, so did they now distress those toil-worn
men.</p>
<P>&quot;When sorrow is highest.</p>
<P>Relief is nighest.&quot;</p>
<P>And a mischievous demon-watcher, in pure wantonness,
brought that relief to those fishers of the sea.</p>
<P>Tregeagle was laden with a sack of sand of enormous size,
and was wading across the mouth of the estuary, when one of those wicked
devils, who were kept ever near Tregeagle, in very idleness tripped up the
heavily-laden spirit. The sea was raging with the irritation of a passing
storm; and as Tregeagle fell, the sack was seized by the waves, and its
contents poured out across this arm of the sea.</p>
<P>There, to this day, it rests a bar of sand, fatally
destroying the harbour of Ella's Town. The rage of the inhabitants of this
seaport,--now destroyed,--was great; and with all their priests, away they
went to the Loo Bar, and assailed their destroyer. Against human anger
Tregeagle was proof. The shock of tongues fell harmlessly on his ear, and the
assault of human weapons was unavailing.</p>
<P>By the aid of the priests, and faith-inspired prayers, the
bonds were once more placed upon Tregeagle; and he was, by the force of bell,
book, and candle, sent to the Land's End. There he would find no harbour to
destroy, and but few people to terrify. His task was to sweep the sands from
Porthcurnow Cove round the headland called Tol-Peden-Penwith, into Nanjisal
Cove. Those who know that rugged headland, with its cubical masses of granite,
piled in Titanic grandeur one upon another, will appreciate the task; and when
to all the difficulties are added the strong sweep of the Atlantic current, --
that portion of the Gulf-stream which washes our southern shores,--it will be
evident that the melancholy spirit has, indeed, a task which must endure until
the world shall end.</p>
<P>Even until to-day is Tregeagle labouring at his task. In
calms his wailing is heard; and those sounds which some call the &quot;soughing of
the wind,&quot; are known to be the moanings of Tregeagle; while the coming storms
are predicated by the fearful roarings of this condemned mortal.</p>
<P>[a] Or .<i>Dozmare</i>. Unfortunately
for its bottomless character, in a recent hot and rainless summer, this little
lake became dry.</p>
