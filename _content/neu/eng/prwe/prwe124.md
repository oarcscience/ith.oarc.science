THE SAINT AND JOHANA.

THE walls of what are supposed to be the hut of St Leven are still to he
seen at Bodellen. If -you walk from Bodellen to St Leven Church, on
passing near the stile in Rospletha you will see a three-cornered
garden. This belonged to a woman who is only known to us as Johann.
Johana's Garden is still the name of the place. One Sunday morning St
Leven was passing over the stile to go as usual to his fishing-place
below the church, to catch his dinner. Johana was in the garden picking
pot-herbs at the time, and she lectured the holy man for fishing on a
Sunday. They came to high words, and St Leven told Johana that there was
no more sin in taking his dinner from the sea than she herself committed
in taking hers from the garden. The saint called her foolish Johana, and
said if another of her name was christened in his well she should be a
bigger fool than Johana herself. From that day to this no child called
Johana has been christened in St Leven. All parents who desire to give
that name to their daughters, dreading St Leven's curse, take the
children to Sennen.
