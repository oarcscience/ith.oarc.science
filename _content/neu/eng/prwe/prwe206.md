THE DROWNED "HAILING THEIR NAMES."

* *THE fishermen dread to walk at night near those parts of the I shore
where there may have been wrecks. The souls of the drowned sailors
appear to haunt those. spots, and the "calling of the dead" has
frequently been heard. I have been told that, under certain
circumstances, especially before the coming of storms, or at certain
seasons, but always at night, these callings are common. Many a
fisherman has declared he has heard the voices of dead sailors "hailing
their own names."
