<P ALIGN="CENTER">WARNINGS AND &quot;TOKENS.&quot;</p>
<P>AMONGST the mining population there is a deeply-rooted
belief in warnings. The following, related by a very respectable man,
formerly a miner, well illustrates this - </p>
<P>&quot;My father, when a lad, worked with a companion (James or
'Jim,' as he was called) in Germo. They lived close by Old Wheal Grey in
Breage. One evening, the daughter of the person with whom they lodged came
in to her mother, crying, 'Billy and Jim ben out theer for more than a hour,
and I ben chasm them among the Kilyur banks, and they waan't ler me catch
them. As fast as I do go to one, they do go to another.' 'Hould your tongue,
child,' said the mother; ''twas their forenoon core, and they both ben up in
bed this hours.' 'I 'm sure I ben chasm them,' said the girl. The mother
then went up-stairs and awoke the lads, telling them the story. One of them
said, ''Tis a warning; somethin will happen in un old end, and I shan't go
to mine this core.' 'Nonsense,' said the other; 'don't let us be so
foolish;. the child has been playing with some strangers, and it isn't worth
while to be spaled for any such foolishness.' 'I tell you,' replied the
other,' I won't go.' As it was useless for one man to go alone, both
remained away. In the course of the night, however a run took place in the
end they were working in, and tens of thousands of kibblefuls came away. Had
they been at work, it was scarcely possible for them to have escaped.&quot;</p>
<P>At Wheal Vor it has always been and is now believed that a
fatal accident in the mine is presaged by the appearance of a hare or white
rabbit in one of the engine-houses. The men solemnly declare that they have
chased these appearances till they were hemmed in apparently, without being
able to catch th&#231;m. The white rabbit on one occasion being <i>run into a
&quot;windbore&quot; </i>lying on the ground, <i>and, though stopped in, </i>escaped.</p>
<P>In this mine there appears to be a general belief among the
men in &quot;tokens&quot; and supernatural appearances. A few months since, a fine old
man reported, on being relieved from his turn as watcher, that during the
night he heard a loud sound like the emptying of a cartload of rubbish in
front of the account-house, where he was staying. On going out, nothing was
to be seen. The poor fellow, considering the strange sound as a &quot;warning,&quot;
pined away and died within a few weeks.</p>
