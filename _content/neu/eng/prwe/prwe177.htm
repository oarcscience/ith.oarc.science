<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE WITCH OF FRADDAM AND THE ENCHANTER
OF PENGERSWICK.</p>
<P>AGAIN and again had the Lord of Pengerswick reversed the
spells of the Witch of Fraddam, who was reported to be the most powerful
weird woman in the west country. She bad been thwarted so many times by this
&quot;white witch,&quot; that she resolved to destroy him by some magic more potent
than anything yet heard of. It is said that she betook herself to Kynance
Cove, and that there she raised the devil by her incantations, and that she
pledged her soul to him in return for the aid he promised. The enchanter's
famous mare was to be seduced to drink from a tub of poisoned water placed
by the road-side, the effect of which was to render her in the highest
degree restive, and cause her to fling her rider. The wounded Lord of
Pengerswick was, in his agony, to be drenched by the old witch, with some
hell-broth, brewed in the blackest night, under the most evil aspects of the
stars; by this he would be in her power for ever, and she might torment him
as she pleased. The devil felt certain of securing the soul of the witch of
Fraddam, but he was less certain of securing that of the enchanter. They
say, indeed, that the sorcery which Pengerswick learned in the East was so
potent, that the devil feared him. However, as the proverb is, he held with
the hounds and ran with the hare. The witch collected with the utmost care
all the deadly things she could obtain, with which to brew her famous drink.
In the darkest night, in the midst of the wildest storms, amidst the
flashings of lightnings and the bellowings of the thunder, the witch was
seen riding on her black ram-cat over the moors and mountains in search of
her poisons. At</p>
<P>length all was complete--the horse-drink was boiled, the
hell-broth was brewed. It was in March, about the time of the equinox; the
night was dark, and the King of Storms was abroad. The witch planted her tub
of drink in a dark lane, through which she knew the Lord of Pengerswick must
pass, and near to it she sat, croning over her crock of broth. The
witch-woman had not long to wait; amidst the hurrying winds was heard the
heavy tramp of the enchanter's mare, and soon she perceived the outline of
man and horse defined sharply against the line of lurid light which
stretched along the western horizon. On they came; the witch was scarcely
able to contain herself--her joy and her fears, struggling one with the
other, almost overpowered her. On came the horse and her rider they neared
the tub of drink; the mare snorted loudly, and her eyes flashed fire as she
looked at the black tub by the road-side. Pengerswick bent him over the
horse's neck and whispered into her ear; she turns round, and flinging out
her heels, with one kick she scattered all to the wild winds. The tub flew
before the blow; it rushed against the crock, which it overturned, and
striking against the legs of the old Witch of Fraddam, she fell along with
the tub, which assumed the shape of a coffin. Her terror was extreme she who
thought to have unhorsed the conjurer, found herself in a carriage for which
she did not bargain. The enchanter raised his voice and gave utterance to
some wild words in an unknown tongue, at which even his terrible mare
trembled. A whirlwind arose, and the devil was in the midst of it. He took
the coffin in which lay the terrified witch high into the air, and the crock
followed them. The derisive laughter of Pengerswick, and the savage neighing
of the horse, were heard above the roar of the winds. At length, with a
satisfied tone, he exclaimed, &quot;She is settled till the day of doom,&quot; gave
the mare the spurs, and rode rapidly home.</p>
<P>The Witch of Fradd&#226;m still floats up and down, over the
seas, around the coast, in her coffin, followed by the crock, which seems
like a punt in attendance on a jolly-boat. She still works mischief,
stirring up the sea with her ladle and broom till the waves swell into
mountains, which heave off from their 'crests so much mist and fciam, that
these wild wanderers of the winds can scarcely be seen through the mist. Woe
to the mariner who sees the witch !</p>
<P>The Lord of Pengerswick alone had power over her. He had
but to stand on his tower, and blow three blasts on his trumpet, to summon
her to the shore, and compel her to peace.</p>
