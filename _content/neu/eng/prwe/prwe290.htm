<P ALIGN="CENTER">WHISTLING</p>
<P>
&nbsp;TO whistle by night is one of the unpardonable sins amongst
the fishermen of St Ives. My correspondent says, &quot;I would no more dare go
among a party of fishermen at night whistling a popular air than into a
den of untamed tigers.&quot;</p>
<P>No miner will allow of whistling underground. I could
never learn from the miners whether they regarded it as unlucky or not. I
rather think they feel that whistling indicates thoughtlessness, and they
know their labour is one of danger, requiring serious attention.</p>
