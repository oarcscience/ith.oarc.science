<P>WWHEN you cross the brook which divides St Leven from
Sennen, you are on the estate of Treville.</p>
<P>Tradition tells us that this estate was given to an old
family who came with the Conqueror to this country. This ancestor is said to
have been the Duke of Normandy's wine-taster, and that he belonged to the
ancient counts of Treville, hence the name of the estate. Certain it is the
property has ever been held without poll deeds. For many generations the
family has been declining, and the race is now nearly, if not quite,
extinct.</p>
<P>Through all time a peculiar token has marked the coming
death of a Vingoe. Above the deep caverns in the Treville cliff rises a carn
. On this, chains of fire were seen ascending and descending, and often
accompanied by loud and frightful noises.</p>
<P>It is said that these tokens have not been seen since the
last male of the family came to a violent end.</p>
