<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE CITY OF LANCARROW OR LANGONA [a]</p>
<P>
&nbsp;<br>
WE cannot say how many years since, but once there stood on the
northern shores of Cornwall, extending over all that country between the
Ganrell and Perranporth, a large city called Langarrow or Langona. The
sand-hills which now extend over this part of the coast cover that great city,
and the memory of the sad and sudden catastrophe still lingers among the
peasantry. So settled is tradition, that no other time than 900 years since is
ever mentioned as the period at which Langarrow was buried. This city in its
prime is said to have been the largest in England, and to have had seven
churches, which were alike remarkable for their beauty and their size. The
inhabitants were wealthy, and according to received accounts, they drew their 
wealth from a large tract of level land, thickly wooded in some parts, and
highly cultivated in others--from the sea, which was overflowing with fish of
all kinds--and from mines, which yielded them abundance of tin and lead.</p>
<P>To this remote city, in those days, criminals were
transported from other parts of Britain. They were made to work in the mines
on the coast, in constructing a new harbour in the Gannell, and clearing it of
sand, so that ships of large burden could in those days sail far inland.
Numerous curious excavations in the rocks, on either side of this estuary, are
still pointed out as being evidences of the works of the convicts. This
portion of the population of Langarrow were not allowed to dwell within the
city. The convicts and their families had to construct huts or dig caves on
the wild moors of this unsheltered northern shore, and to this day evidences
of their existence are found under the sand, in heaps of wood-ashes, amidst
which are discovered considerable quantities of mussel and cockle shells,
which we may suppose was their principal food. As far as I know, these are the
first indications of anything resembling the Kjokkenm&#246;ddings, or refuse-heaps
of Denmark, which have been discovered in this country.</p>
<P>For a long period this city flourished in its prime, and
its inhabitants were in the enjoyment of every luxury which industry could
obtain or wealth could purchase. Sin, in many of its worst forms, was however
present amongst the people. The convicts sent to Langarrow were of the vilest.
They were long kept widely separated; but use breeds familiarity, and
gradually the more designing of the convicts persuaded their masters to employ
them within the city. The result of' this was, after a few years, an
amalgamation of the two classes of the population. The daughters of Langarrow
were married to the criminals, and thus crime became the familiar spirit of
the place. The progress of this may have been slow--the result was, however,
sure; and eventually, when vice was dominant, and the whole population sunk in
sensual pleasures, the anger of the Lord fell upon them. A storm of unusual
violence arose, and continued blowing, without intermitting its violence for
one moment, for three days and nights. In that period the hills of blown sand,
extending, with few intervals, from Crantock to Perran were formed, burying
the city, its churches, and its inhabitants in a common grave. To the present
time those sand-hills stand a monument of God's wrath; and in several places
we certainly find considerable quantities of bleached human bones, which are
to many strong evidence of the correctness of tradition.</p>
<P>Crantock was, according to tradition, once a trading town,
and it then had a religious house, with a dean and nine prebends. The Gannell
filling up ruined the town. This must have happened when Langarrow was
destroyed.</p>
<P>On Gwithian Sands the remains of what is supposed to have been
a church has been discovered, and according to Hals and Gilbert, a similar
tradition exists here of a buried town. Gilbert writes thus:-- </p>
<P>&quot;There has always existed a traditional account of the
inundation of sand in this parish, corroborated by the ecclesiastical
valuations, which are far too high for the actual extent of the land, and also
said to be confirmed by documents preserved in the Arundel family, carrying
back the commencement of the evil nearly to the period of their acquiring the
property.</p>
<P>&quot;With respect to more recent inundations, Mr Hockin states
to Mr Lysons, that the Barton of Upton, one of the principal farms, was
suddenly overwhelmed; that his great-grandfather remembered the occupier
residing in the farmhouse, which was nearly buried in one night, the family
being obliged to make their escape through the chamber windows; and that in
consequence of the wind producing a shifting of the sand, in the winter of
1808-9, the house, after having disappeared for more than a century, came
again to view.</p>
<P>&quot;The rector further stated that he himself remembered two
fields being lost at Gwithian, and that they are now covered with sand to the
depth of ten or twelve feet, and that the church-town would have been also
lost, if the parish officers had not promptly resorted to the expedient of
planting rushes. These stop the complete progress of sand, and greatly
facilitate the growth of other vegetation on the surface, so as to create a
thin turf, The hillocks of sand exhibit a model in miniature of the
Alps.&quot;--Gilbert, vol. ii, p. 149.</p>
<P>[a] '&quot;The vicarage church of Crantock is commonly called
Languna or Langona,--that is to say, the hay temple or church,--and is
suitable to its name, situate in a large hay meadow of rich land, containing
about three acres, where, by ancient custom, the vicar's, cattle all pasture
over the dead bodies interred thereinto.&quot;--Hals, as given by Gilbert. See
Appendix Q.</p>
