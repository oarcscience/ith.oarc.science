<P>
&nbsp;IN relation to this subject,
and confirming an opinion already expressed in the existence still of a
belief in magic and charms, I print the following communication from a
lady of considerable literary ability -</p>
<P>&quot;Every country, it may be safely inferred, has its own
individual, perhaps characteristic, Charm-record; and inquiry into it
would more than probably recompense the labour, by the light it would let
in on the still but little investigated philosophy of the human mind, and
the growth of popular superstitions. The portion of our country best known
to the writer of these remarks is Cornwall, remarkable for the picturesque
wild-ness of its scenery, and not less so for its numerous superstitions.
The Rev. Charles Kingsley, in his 'Yeast,' has availed himself, with his
usual tact and power, of one of the most striking of these, having
reference to the cruel treatment of the Jews, who were sold as slaves to
work in the mines; the evil treatment they experienced being avenged on
modem miners, by the terrors the souls of the departed Hebrews inflicted,
in returning to the scene of their former compulsory toil, and echoing the
sounds of the workmen now labouring in flesh and blood. But this is a
digression from the main object of this article--viz., the belief in
charms. Several years ago, while residing at Falmouth, I remember to have
heard of a man in humble life, named Thomas Martin, whose abode was said
to be at a village in the neighbourhood of Redruth, and who accomplished
wonderful cures of children subject to fits, or personally injured by any
deformity, by his power of charming. This man also practised soothsaying
to a considerable extent, and revealed, with unquestionable accuracy,
where articles mysteriously abstracted were concealed. If a cow suddenly
lost her milk, whether witchcraft had exerted its malignant influence on
the non-producing animal or no, such a personage could not but exercise an
important power over the rustic population of the neighbourhood. But
belief in the mysterious intelligence of Martin was by no means confined
to the peasant class. .k highly-respected and even ladylike person told
the writer, with all the gravity becoming such a communication, that she
had once made an appointment with Thomas Martin to meet him at a certain
stile, for the purpose of receiving from him the prediction of her future
lot,--in other words, having her fortune told; and hastening thither at
the time appointed, was horrified to find the stile occupied by a large
black snake. As Martin did not make his appearance, she inferred that he
had assumed the serpent form, and not being disposed to hold any
intercourse with a being of such questionable exterior, she hastened away,
determined never more to risk the attainment of the knowledge she coveted
through a probably diabolic channel.</p>
<P>&quot;This anecdote is given as veritable experience of the
belief which may prevail in a mind fairly intelligent, and generally
rational in conducting the ordinary business of life.</p>
<P>&quot;Martin's reputation was disputed by no one, and that
it continued unimpaired to the close of his life reflects no
inconsiderable credit on the shrewdness and sagacity of his mind and his
power of guessing.</p>
<P>&quot;In the town where the writer has been residing for the
last four months, there is a female, advanced in years and of good
character, who, according to the report of many persons,--one a relative
of her own,--is peculiarly endowed with the power of charming away the
disease called the 'kennel,' an affection of the eye which causes extreme
pain. A young lady's father was one evening suffering severe pain in the
right eye, and after trying various remedies without effect (the agony
having greatly increased), in her despair she sought an occasion to leave
the house, and hastened at once to the abode of the charmer. She told her
errand to the woman, who said that many had come to her for the purpose of
ridiculing her, and she did not like to say anything about charming,-- she
did not wish to be laughed at. On this the young lady assured her that her
object in true faith was to obtain relief for her suffering father, and by
no means to indulge the spirit of ridicule. On this representation she was
satisfied, and desired to know the <i>kind</i> of kennel which affected
the gentleman's eye. This information the daughter was unable to give her,
being unacquainted with their peculiarities; 'because,' said the charmer,
'there are nine kinds of kennels,' intimating at the same time that a
different charm might be said or applied to each,-- so that, to avoid
omitting any, she must say the charms for all, in order that the one
especially affecting the diseased eye should be certainly included in the
charm. She went up-stairs, and remained about half an hour. On her return
she addressed the young lady, and told her she might go home, where she
would learn whether the eye had been relieved. She took no money for her
incantation. Any little present might be offered at a subsequent visit,
but no direct payment was ever requested, and indeed would have been
declined. The amazement and pleasure of the anxious daughter, on her
arrival at home, will be imagined, on learning from her father that the
intense pain in the eye had ceased during her absence, though he had not
been made acquainted with her errand. The influence of the faith of
another, in this case, on the relief of the afflicted person, has no
verisimilitude save with that of the father of the demoniac in the gospel,
or the removal of the son's fever in consequence of the faith of the
father. I have no reason whatever to question the truth of this story,
which was confirmed by the wife of the gentleman thus relieved.</p>
<P>&quot;A still more curious instance of the effect of charm,
though quite of another character, was related to me by the same party.
The gentleman referred to being much afflicted with cramp, his wife was
earnestly advised, by a country woman to whom she mentioned the
circumstance, to request her husband to place his slippers, with the toes
turned upward, at the foot of the bed. Half smiling at the wise counsel,
yet perhaps not altogether incredulous, he followed the good woman's
advice, and to his great comfort found himself unaffected by his dreaded
enemy throughout the night. His faith being thus established in the
anti-cramp influence of upturned slippers, he took care to place them, or
to have them placed, in the prescribed attitude on several successive
nights. One night, however, he was again seized with some appalling
twinges, and bethinking himself of the cause, suddenly recollected that in
hastening into bed he had not observed the important rule; instantly he
had the slippers restored to their proper position, and, to his
astonishment and delight, the pain ceased, and visited him no more. After
this experience of the wonderful effects that followed so simple a
specific, it may be easily imagined that he did not again risk the return
of the cramp from neglecting it. Such phenomena seem beyond the power of
explanation on any known medical principles. If any one more than usually
versed in the subtle power exercised on the body by the mind, can throw
light on the slipper cure of the cramp, he will deserve much at the hands
of physiological and mental science.&quot; S. E. M.</p>
