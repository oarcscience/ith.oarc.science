<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE GIANTS AT PLAY.</p>
<P><br>
IN several parts of Cornwall there are evidences that these Titans were a
sportive race. Huge rocks are preserved to show where they played at
trap-ball, at hurling, and other athletic games. The giants of Trecrobben and
St Michael's Mount often met for a game at bob-buttons. The Mount was the
&quot;bob,&quot; on which flat masses of granite were placed to serve as buttons, and
Trecrobben Hill was the &quot;mit,&quot; or the spot from which the throw was made. This
order was sometimes reversed. On the outside of St Michael's Mount, many a
granite slab which had been knocked off the &quot;bob&quot; is yet to be 'found; and
numerous piles of rough cubical masses of the same rock, said to be the
granite of Trecrobben Hill, [a] show how eagerly the game was played.</p>
<P>Trecrobben Hill was well chosen by the giants as the site
of their castle. From it they surveyed the country on every side and friend or
enemy was seen at a considerable distance as he approached the guarded spot.
It is as clear as tradition can make it, that Trecrobben was the centre of a
region full of giants. On Lescudjack Hill, close to Penzance, there is &quot;The
Giant's Round,&quot; evidently the scene of many a sanguinary conflict, since the
Cornish antiquarian authority Borlase informs us, that Lesgudzhek signifies
the &quot;Castle of the Bloody Field.&quot; On the cairn at Gulval are several
impressions on the rocks, all referable to the giants. In Madron there is the
celebrated &quot;Giant's Cave;&quot; and the well-known Lanyon cromlech is reported by
some to be the &quot; Giant's Coit,&quot; while others declare it to be the &quot; Giant's
Table.&quot; Cairn Gaiva, again, is celebrated for its giant; and, indeed, every
hill within sight has some monument preserving the memory of those, &quot;the
Titans fierce.&quot;</p>
<P>[a] Mr O. Halliwell, who carefully
followed in the&quot; Footsteps of the Giants,&quot; referring to this game as played by
them, says:-- &quot;Doubtlessly the Giant's Chair on Trink Hill was frequently used
during the progress of the game, nor is it improbable that the Giant's Well was
also in requisition. Here, then, were at hand opportunities for rest and
refreshment--the circumstances of the various traditions agreeing well with,
and, in fact, demonstrating the truth of each other.&quot;</p>
