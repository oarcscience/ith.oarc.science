<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LIMP CORPSE.</p>
<P>IF a corpse stiffens shortly after death, all is thought to
proceed naturally; but if the limbs remain flexible, some one of the family is
shortly to follow. If the eyes of a corpse are difficult to close, it is said
&quot;they are looking after a follower.&quot;</p>
<P>***</p>
<P>To find a louse on one's linen, is a sign of sickness. To
find. two, indicates a severe illness. If three lice are so found within a
month, it is a &quot;token to prepare.&quot;</p>
<P>Talking backwards, or putting one word incorrectly before
another,--&quot;the cart before the horse,&quot;--is considered to foretell that you
will shortly see a stranger.</p>
<P>If two young people, in conversation, happen to think of the
same thing at the same time, and one of them utters the thought before the
other, that one is certain to be married first.</p>
