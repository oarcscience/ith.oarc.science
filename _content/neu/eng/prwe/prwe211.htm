<P ALIGN="CENTER">PILCHARDS CRYING FOR MORE</p>
<P>WHEN there is a large catch of fish (pilchards), they are
preserved,--put in bulk, as the phrase is,--by being rubbed with salt, and
placed in regular order, one on the other, head and tails alternately,
forming regular walls of fish.</p>
<P>The fish often, when so placed, make a squeaking noise; this
is called &quot;crying for more,&quot; and is regarded as a most favourable sign. More
fish may soon be expected to be brought to the same cellar.</p>
<P>The noise which is heard is really produced by the bursting
of the air-bladders; and when many break together, which, when hundreds of
thousands are piled in a mass, is not unusual, the sound is a loud one.</p>
