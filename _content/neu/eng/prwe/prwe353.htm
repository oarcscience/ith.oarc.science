<P>ANOTHER legend relates that it was not the stepmother
found by Pengerswick whose &quot;skin was covered with scales like a
serpent,&quot; but that the lady brought 'home from Palestine by him was an
Ophidian--a serpent-worshipper. Hence she became celebrated as a woman
possessed by a serpent--having a serpent's power--in fact, a Lamia. 
This is the only tradition of the kind with which I am acquainted in
this county.</p>
