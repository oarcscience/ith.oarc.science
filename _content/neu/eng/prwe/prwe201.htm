<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PHANTOM SHIP.</p>
<P>YEARS long ago, one night, a gig's crew was called to go
off to a &quot;hobble,&quot; to the westwards of St Ives Head. No sooner was one boat
launched than several others were put off from the shore, and a stiff chase
was maintained, each one being eager to get to the ship, as she had the
appearance of a foreign trader. The hull was clearly visible, she was a
schooner-rigged vessel, with a light over her bows.</p>
<P>Away they pulled, and the boat which had been first
launched still kept ahead by dint of mechanical power and skill. All the men
had thrown off their jackets to row with more freedom. At length the
helmsman cried out, &quot;Stand ready to board her.&quot; The sailor rowing the bow
oar slipped it out of the row-lock, and stood on the forethought, taking his
jacket on his arm, ready to spring aboard.</p>
<P>The vessel came so close to the boat that they could see
the men, and the bow-oar man made a grasp at her bulwarks. His hand found
nothing solid, and he fell, being caught by one of his mates, back into the
boat, instead of into the water. Then ship and lights disappeared. The next
morning the <i>Neptune </i>of London, Captain Richard Grant, was wrecked at
Gwithian, and all perished. The captain's body was picked up after a few
days, and that of his son also. They were both buried in Gwithian
churchyard.</p>
