<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE &quot;HA-AF&quot; A FACE.</p>
<P>JAMES BERRYMAN said, &quot;Fa-ather took a house doun to
Lelant, whear we lived for a bra' bit. Very often after I ben in bed, our
ould cat wud tear up, coover its ars like a ma-aged thing, jump uppon the
bed, and dig her ould hed under the clothes, as if she wud git doun to 
bottom, and jest after, a man's face, with a light round un, wud cum in;
kwas ha-af a face like, and it wud stop at the bottom of the bed. I 'ye sen
it many times; and fa-ather, though he didn't say nothin', was glad enough
to leave the place. I was tould that the house belonged to an ould man, and
that two rich gentlemen, brothers, who lived close by, wanted the place, and
put on law, and got the place from the poor ould man. When they war goin' to
turn un out, the poor fellow stopped and looked round crying, and then fell
down in a fit, was put to bed, and died in the house; and 'twas he, they
said, that used to come back.&quot;</p>
