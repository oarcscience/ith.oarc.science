<p>Many of the chief facts regarding the <i>Atlamol</i>, which follows the <i>Atlakvitha</i> in the <i>Codex Regius</i>, are outlined in the introductory note to the earlier Atli lay. That the superscription in the manuscript is correct, and that the poem was actually composed in Greenland, is generally accepted; the specific reference to polar bears (stanza 17), and the general color of the entire poem make this origin exceedingly likely. Most critics, again, agree in dating the poem nearer 1100 than 1050. As to its state of preservation there is some dispute, but, barring one or two possible gaps of some importance, and the usual number of passages in which the interpolation or omission of one or two lines may be suspected, the <i>Atlamol</i> has clearly come down to us in fairly good shape.</p> 
<p>Throughout the poem the epic quality of the story itself is overshadowed by the romantically sentimental tendencies of the poet, and by his desire to adapt the narrative to the understanding of his fellow-Greenlanders. The substance of the poem is the same as that of the <i>Atlakvitha</i>; it tells of Atli's message to the sons of Gjuki, their journey to Atli's home, the slaying of Hogni and Gunnar, Guthrun's bitterness over the death of her brothers, and her bloody revenge on Atli. Thus in its bare out line the <i>Atlamol</i> represents simply the Frankish blending of the legends of the slaughter of the Burgundians and the death of Attila (cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, introductory note). But here the resemblance ends. The poet has added characters, apparently of his own creation, for the sake of episodes which would appeal to both the men and the women of the Greenland settlement. Sea voyages take the place of journeys by land; Atli is reproached, not for cowardice in battle, but for weakness at the Thing or great council. The additions made by the poet are responsible for the <i>Atlamol's</i> being the longest of all the heroic poems in the Eddic collection, and they give it a kind of emotional vivid ness, but it has little of the compressed intensity of the older poems. Its greatest interest lies in its demonstration of the manner in which a story brought to the North from the South Germanic lands could be adapted to the understanding and tastes of its</p> 
<p><a name="page_500"><font size="1" color="green">p. 500</font></A></p> 
<p>eleventh century hearers without any material change of the basic narrative.</p> 
<p>In what form or forms the story of the Gjukungs and Atli reached the Greenland poet cannot be determined, but it seems likely that he was familiar with older poems on the subject, and possibly with the <i>Atlakvitha</i> itself. That the details which are peculiar to the <i>Atlamol</i>, such as the figures of Kostbera and Glaumvor, existed in earlier tradition seems doubtful, but the son of Hogni, who aids Guthrun in the slaying of Atli, appears, though under another name, in other late versions of the story, and it is impossible to say just how much the poet relied on his own imagination and how far he found suggestions and hints in the prose or verse stories of Atli with which he was familiar.</p> 
<p>The poem is in Malahattr (cf. Introduction) throughout, the verse being far more regular than in the <i>Atlakvitha</i>. The compilers of the <i>Volsungasaga</i> evidently knew it in very much the form in which we now have it, for in the main it is paraphrased with great fidelity.</p> 
<p>1. There are many who know | how of old did men<br> In counsel gather; | little good did they get;<br> In secret they plotted, | it was sore for them later,<br> And for Gjuki's sons, | whose trust they deceived.</p> 
<p>2. Fate grew for the princes, | to death they were given;<br> Ill counsel was Atli's, | though keenness he had;</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[1. <i>Men</i>: Atli and his advisers, with whom he planned the death of the sons of <i>Gjuki</i>, Gunnar and Hogni. The poet's reference to the story as well known explains the abruptness of his introduction, without the mention of Atli's name, and his reference to Guthrun in stanza 3 simply as "the woman" ("husfreyja," goddess of the house).</p> 
<p>2. <i>Princes</i>: Atli, Gunnar, and Hogni. <i>Bulwark</i>: Atli's slaying [fp. 501] of his wife's brothers, who were ready to support and defend him in his greatness, was the cause of his own death.]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_501"><font size="1" color="green">p. 501</font></A></p> 
<p>He felled his staunch bulwark, | his own sorrow fashioned,<br> Soon a message he sent | that his kinsmen should seek him.</p> 
<p>3. Wise was the woman, | she fain would use wisdom,<br> She saw well what meant | all they said in secret;<br> From her heart it was hid | how help she might render,<br> The sea they should sail, | while herself she should go not.</p> 
<p>4. Runes did she fashion, | but false Vingi made them,<br> The speeder of hatred, | ere to give them he sought;<br> Then soon fared the warriors | whom Atli had sent,<br> And to Limafjord came, | to the home of the kings.</p> 
<p>5. They were kindly with ale, | and fires they kindled,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[3. <i>The woman</i>: Guthrun, concerning whose marriage to Atli cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II.</i> <i>The sea</i>: a late and essentially Greenland variation of the geography of the Atli story. Even the <i>Atlakvitha</i>, perhaps half a century earlier, separates Atli's land from that of the Gjukungs only by a forest.</p> 
<p>4. <i>Runes</i>: on the two versions of Guthrun's warning, and also on the name of the messenger (here Vingi), cf. <i>Drap Niflunga</i> and note. <i>Limafjord</i>: probably the Limfjord of northern Jutland, an important point in the wars of the eleventh century. The name was derived from "Eylimafjor&thorn;," i.e., Eylimi's fjord. The poet may really have thought that the kingdom of the Burgundians was in Jutland, or he may simply have taken a well-known name for the sake of vividness.]</p> </font>

<p>They thought not of craft | from the guests who had come;<br> The gifts did they take | that the noble one gave them,<br> On the pillars they hung them, | no fear did they harbor.</p> 
<p>6. Forth did Kostbera, | wife of Hogni, then come,<br> Full kindly she was, | and she welcomed them both;<br> And glad too was Glaumvor, | the wife of Gunnar,<br> She knew well to care | for the needs of the guests.</p> 
<p>7. Then Hogni they asked | if more eager he were,<br> Full clear was the guile, | if on guard they had been;<br> Then Gunnar made promise, | if Hogni would go,<br> And Hogni made answer | as the other counseled.</p> 
<p>8. Then the famed ones brought mead, | and fair was the feast,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[5. Some editors assume a gap after this stanza.</p> 
<p>6. Some editions place this stanza between stanzas 7 and 8. <i>Kostbera</i> ("The Giver of Food") and <i>Glaumvor</i> ("The Merry"): presumably creations of the poet. <i>Both</i>: Atli's two emissaries, Vingi and the one here unnamed (Knefr&ouml;th?).</p> 
<p>7. It is altogether probable that a stanza has been lost between stanzas 6 and 7, in which Gunnar is first invited, and replies doubtfully. <i>Made promise</i>: many editions emend the text to read "promised the journey." The text of line 4 is obscure; the manuscript reads "nitti" ("refused"), which many editors have changed to "hlitti," which means exactly the opposite. 8. No gap is indicated in the manuscript; Bugge adds (line [fp. 503] 3): "Then the warriors rose, | and to slumber made ready." The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 1-2. Others suggest the loss of a line after line 4.]</p> </font>

<p>Full many were the horns, | till the men had drunk deep;<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> Then the mates made ready | their beds for resting.</p> 
<p>9. Wise was Kostbera, | and cunning in rune-craft,<br> The letters would she read | by the light of the fire;<br> But full quickly her tongue | to her palate clave,<br> So strange did they seem | that their meaning she saw not.</p> 
<p>10. Full soon then his bed | came Hogni to seek,<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> The clear-souled one dreamed, | and her dream she kept not,<br> To the warrior the wise one | spake when she wakened:</p> 
<p>11. "Thou wouldst go hence, | Hogni, but heed my counsel,--</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[9. The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as the beginning of a stanza; cf. note on stanza 8.</p> 
<p>10. Some editions combine this stanza with lines 1-2 of stanza 11. The manuscript indicates no gap. Grundtvig adds (line 2) "But sleep to the woman | so wise came little."</p> 
<p>11. Some editions make a separate stanza out of lines 1-2, or combine them with stanza 10, and combine lines 3-4 with stanza [fp. 504]12 (either lines 1-4 or 1-2). The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza.]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_504"><font size="1" color="green">p. 504</font></A></p> 
<p>Known to few are the runes,-- | and put off thy faring;<br> I have read now the runes | that thy sister wrote,<br> And this time the bright one | did not bid thee to come.</p> 
<p>12. "Full much do I wonder, | nor well can I see,<br> Why the woman wise | so wildly hath written;<br> But to me it seems | that the meaning beneath<br> Is that both shall be slain | if soon ye shall go.<br> But one rune she missed, | or else others have marred it."</p> <i>
<p>Hogni spake:</i><br> 13. "All women are fearful; | not so do I feel,<br> Ill I seek not to find | till I soon must avenge it;<br> The king now will give us | the glow-ruddy gold;<br> I never shall fear, | though of dangers I know."</p> <i>
<p>Kostbera spake:</i><br> 14. "In danger ye fare, | if forth ye go thither,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[12. Line 5 may be spurious, or else all that is left of a lost stanza. The manuscript marks it as the beginning of a new stanza, which, as the text stands, is clearly impossible.</p> 
<p>13. The manuscript, followed by some editions, has "Hogni spake" in the middle of line 1. <i>Ill</i>: the manuscript and many editions have "this." <i>The king</i>: Atli.</p> 
<p>14. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers in this dialogue between Kostbera and Hogni (stanzas 14-19). Two line, may possibly have been lost after line 2, filling out stanza 14 and [fp. 505] making stanza 15 (then consisting of lines 3-4 of stanza 14 and lines 1-2 of stanza 15) the account of Kostbera's first dream. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza. In any case, the lost lines cannot materially have altered the meaning.]</p> </font>

<p>No welcoming friendly | this time shall ye find;<br> For I dreamed now, Hogni, | and nought will I hide,<br> Full evil thy faring, | if rightly I fear.</p> 
<p>15. "Thy bed-covering saw I | in the flames burning,<br> And the fire burst high | through the walls of my home."<br> <i>Hogni spake:</i><br> "Yon garment of linen | lies little of worth,<br> It will soon be burned, | so thou sawest the bed-cover."</p> <i>
<p>Kostbera spake:</i><br> 16. "A bear saw I enter, | the pillars he broke,<br> And he brandished his claws | so that craven we were;<br> With his mouth seized he many, | and nought was our might,<br> And loud was the tumult, <u>| </u>not little it was."</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[15. <i>Saw I</i>: the manuscript here, as also in stanzas 16, 18, 2r, 22, and 24, has "methought," which involves a metrical error. Some editors regard lines 3-4 as the remains of a four-line stanza. Regarding Kostbera's warning dreams, and Hogni's matter-of-fact interpretations of them, cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha II</i>, 39-44.</p> 
<p>16. The meaning of the first half of line 3 in the original is obscure.]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_506"><font size="1" color="green">p. 506</font></A></p> <i>
<p>Hogni spake:</i><br> 17. "Now a storm is brewing, | and wild it grows swiftly,<br> A dream of an ice-bear | means a gale from the east."</p> <i>
<p>Kostbera spake</i>:<br> 18. "An eagle I saw flying | from the end through the house,<br> Our fate must be bad, | for with blood he sprinkled us;<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> From the evil I fear | that 'twas Atli's spirit."</p> <i>
<p>Hogni spake:</i><br> 19. "They will slaughter soon, | and so blood do we see,<br> Oft oxen it means | when of eagles one dreams;</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[17. Two lines may have been lost after line 2, but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase gives no clue. <i>Ice-bear</i>: polar bears, common in Greenland, are very rarely found in Iceland, and never in Norway, a fact which substantiates the manuscript's reference to Greenland as the home of the poem.</p> 
<p>18. The manuscript indicates no gap, but most editors assume the loss of a line after line 1 or 2; Grundtvig adds, after line 1: "Black were his feathers, | with blood was he covered." <i>Atli's spirit</i>: the poet's folk-lore seems here a bit weak. Presumably he means such a female following-spirit ("fylgja") as appears in <i>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</i>, prose following stanza 34 (cf. note thereon), but the word he uses, "hamr" (masculine) means "skin," "shape." He may, however, imply that Atli had assumed the shape of an eagle for this occasion.</p> 
<p>19. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza.]</p> </font>

<p>True is Atli's heart, | whatever thou dreamest."<br> Then silent they were, | and nought further they said.</p> 
<p>20. The high-born ones wakened, | and like speech they had,<br> Then did Glaumvor tell | how in terror she dreamed,<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. Gunnar | two roads they should go.</p> <i>
<p>Glaumvor spake:</i><br> 21. "A gallows saw I ready, | thou didst go to thy hanging,<br> Thy flesh serpents ate, | and yet living I found thee;<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> The gods' doom descended; | now say what it boded."</p> 
<p align="CENTER">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> 
<p>22. "A sword drawn bloody | from thy garments I saw,--</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[20. The manuscript indicates no gap, but none of the many attempted emendations have made sense out of the words as they stand. The proper location for' the missing words is sheer guesswork. <i>Two roads</i>: probably the meaning is that their way (i.e., their success) would be doubtful.</p> 
<p>21. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers in this dialogue (stanzas 21-26). No gap is indicated after line 2. Most editors assume the loss of two lines or of a full stanza after [fp. 508] stanza 21 giving Gunnar's interpretation of Glaumvor's dream, but the <i>Volsungasaga</i> gives no clue, as it does not mention this first dream at all. Grundtvig suggests as Gunnar's answer: "Banners are gleaming, | since of gallows didst dream, / And wealth it must mean | that thou serpents didst watch." <i>Gods' doom</i>: an odd, and apparently mistaken, use of the phrase "ragna r&ouml;k" (cf. <i>Voluspo</i>, introductory note).]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_508"><font size="1" color="green">p. 508</font></A></p> 
<p>Such a dream is hard | o a husband to tell,--<br> A spear stood, methought, | through thy body thrust,<br> And at head and feet | the wolves were howling."</p> <i>
<p>Gunnar spake:</i><br> 23. "The hounds are running, | loud their barking is heard,<br> Oft hounds' clamor follows | the flying of spears."</p> <i>
<p>Glaumvor spake:</i><br> 24. "A river the length | of the hall saw I run,<br> Full swiftly it roared, | o'er the benches it swept;<br> O'er the feet did it break | of ye brothers twain,<br> The water would yield not; | some meaning there was."</p> 
<p align="CENTER">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> 
<p>25. "I dreamed that by night | came dead women hither,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[25. Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2. Possibly the concluding phrase of line 2 should be "bloody spears," as in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase.</p> 
<p>24. Again Gunnar's interpretation is missing, and most editors either assume a gap or construct two Malahattr lines (out of the <i>Volsungasaga</i> prose paraphrase, which runs: "The grain shall [fp. 509] flow, since thou hast dreamed of rivers, and when we go to the fields, often the chaff rises above our feet."]</p> </font>

<p>Sad were their garments, | and thee were they seeking;<br> They bade thee come swiftly | forth to their benches,<br> And nothing, methinks, | could the Norns avail thee. "</p> <i>
<p>Gunnar spake:</i><br> 26. "Too late is thy speaking, | for so is it settled<br> From the faring I turn not, | the going is fixed,<br> Though likely it is | that our lives shall be short."</p> 
<p>27. Then bright shone the morning, | the men all were ready,<br> They said, and yet each | would the other hold back;<br> Five were the warriors, | and their followers all<br> But twice as many,-- | their minds knew not wisdom.</p> 
<p>28. Sn&aelig;var and Solar, | they were sons of Hogni,<br> Orkning was he called | who came with the others,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[25. The meaning of line 4 is uncertain, but apparently it refers to the guardian spirits or lesser Norns (cf. <i>Fafnismol</i>, 12-13 and notes).</p> 
<p>26. Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza.</p> 
<p>27. <i>Five</i>: Gunnar, Hogni, and the three mentioned in Stanza 28.</p> 
<p>28. Perhaps a line has been lost before line 1; Grundtvig supplies: "Gunnar and Hogni, the heirs twain of Gjuki." <i>Sn&aelig;var</i> (the manuscript here has "Snevar"), <i>Solar</i> and <i>Orkning</i> [fp. 510] appear only in this poem and in the prose narratives based on it. Lines 2-3 may have been expanded out of one line, or possibly line 3 is spurious. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and many editions make a separate stanza out of lines 4-5, many of them assuming the loss of two lines. <i>Shield-tree</i>: warrior (Orkning), here identified as Kostbera's brother. <i>Fair-decked ones</i>: women, i.e., Glaumvor and Kostbera. <i>Fjord</i>: perhaps specifically the <i>Limafjord</i> mentioned in stanza 4.]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_510"><font size="1" color="green">p. 510</font></A></p> 
<p>Blithe was the shield-tree, | the brother of Kostbera;<br> The fair-decked ones followed, | till the fjord divided them,<br> Full hard did they plead, | but the others would hear not.</p> 
<p>29. Then did Glaumvor speak forth, | the wife of Gunnar,<br> To Vingi she said | that which wise to her seemed:<br> "I know not if well | thou requitest our welcome,<br> Full ill was thy coming | if evil shall follow."</p> 
<p>30. Then did Vingi swear, | and full glib was his speech,<br> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> "May giants now take me | if lies I have told ye,<br> And the gallows if hostile | thought did I have."</p> 
<p>31. Then did Bera speak forth, | and fair was her thought,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[30. The manuscript indicates no gap. Grundtvig inserts (line 2): "The evil was clear when his words he uttered."</p> 
<p>31. <i>Bera</i>: Kostbera; the first element in compound feminine [fp. 511] proper names was not infrequently omitted; cf. Hild for Brynhild (<i>Helreith Brynhildar</i>, 6). The manuscript indicates no gap; Grundtvig inserts (line 2): "And clear was her cry to her kinsmen dear."]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_511"><font size="1" color="green">p. 511</font></A></p> 
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<br> "May ye sail now happy, | and victory have,<br> To fare as I bid ye, | may nought your way bar."</p> 
<p>32. Then Hogni made answer,-- | dear held he his kin,-<br> "Take courage, ye wise ones, | whatsoever may come;<br> Though many may speak, | yet is evil oft mighty,<br> And words avail little | to lead one homeward."</p> 
<p>33. They tenderly looked | till each turned on his way,<br> Then with changing fate | were their farings divided.</p> 
<p>34. Full stoutly they rowed, | and the keel clove asunder,<br> Their backs strained at the oars, | and their strength was fierce;</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[32. Hogni's method of cheering his wife and sister-in-law is somewhat unusual, for the meaning of lines 3-4 is that good wishes and blessings are of little use in warding off danger.</p> 
<p>33. Perhaps two lines have been lost after line 2; Grundtvig supplies: "Then weeping did | Glaumvor go to her rest-bed, / And sadly did Bera | her spinning wheel seek."</p> 
<p>34. <i>Keel</i>, etc.: in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, and presumably in the older German tradition, Hagene breaks his oar steering the Burgundians across the Danube (stanza 1564), and, after all have landed, splinters the boat (stanza 1581) in order that there may be no retreating. The poet here seems to have confused the story, [fp. 512] connecting the breaking of the ship's keel with the violence of the rowing, but echoing the older legend in the last line, wherein the ship is allowed to drift away after the, travellers have landed. <i>Oar-loops</i>: the thongs by which the oars in a Norse boat were made fast to the <i>thole-pins</i>, the combination taking the place of the modern oarlock.]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_512"><font size="1" color="green">p. 512</font></A></p> 
<p>The oar-loops were burst, | the thole-pins, were broken,<br> Nor the ship made they fast | ere from her they fared.</p> 
<p>35. Not long was it after-- | the end must I tell--<br> That the home they beheld | that Buthli once had;<br> Loud the gates resounded | when Hogni smote them;<br> Vingi spake then a word | that were better unsaid:</p> 
<p>36. "Go ye far from the house, | for false is its entrance,<br> Soon shall I burn you, | ye are swiftly smitten;<br> I bade ye come fairly, | but falseness was under,<br> Now bide ye afar | while your gallows I fashion."</p> 
<p>37. Then Hogni made answer, | his heart yielded little,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[35. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza, and many editions combine it with stanza 36, some of them assuming the loss of a line from stanza 35. In the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase the second half of line 4 is made a part of Vingi's speech: "Better had ye left this undone."</p> 
<p>36. Cf. note on preceding stanza; the manuscript does not indicate line I as beginning a stanza. Line 3 may be spurious.</p>

<p>[38. Possibly two lines have been lost after line 2.</p> 
<p>39. It is probable that a considerable passage has been lost between stanzas 39 and 40, for the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase includes a dialogue at this point. The manuscript indicates no gap, and most editions combine stanzas 39 and 40 as a single stanza. The prose passage, indicating the substance of what, if any thing, is lost, runs as follows: "'Be welcome among us, and give me that store of gold which is ours by right, the gold that Sigurth had, and that now belongs to Guthrun.' Gunnar said: 'Never shalt thou get that gold, and men of might shalt thou find here, ere we give up our lives, if it is battle thou dost offer us; in truth it seems that thou hast prepared this feast in kingly fashion, [fp. 514] and with little grudging toward eagle and wolf."' The demand for the treasure likewise appears in the Nibelungenlied.]</p> </font>

<p>[40. These two lines, which most editions combine with stanza 39, may be the first or last two of a four-line stanza. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> gives Atli's speech very much as it appears here.</p> 
<p>41. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker; Grundtvig adds as a first line: "Then Hogni laughed loud where the slain Vingi lay." Many editors assume the loss of a line somewhere in the stanza. <i>Unarmed</i>: Hogni does not see Atli's armed followers, who are on the other side of the courtyard (stanza 39). One: Vingi.</p> 
<p>42. Most editors assume the loss of one line, after either line 1 or line 3.</p> 
<p>45. The manuscript reading of lines 1-2, involving a metrical error, is: "In the house came the word | of the warring without, / Loud in front of the hall | they heard a thrall shouting." Some editors assume a gap of two lines after line [fp. 515] 2, the missing passage giving the words of the thrall. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editions make a separate stanza of lines 3-5, same of them assuming the loss of a line after line 3. With the stanza as here given, line 5 may well be spurious.]</p> </font>

<p>44. Then out did she go, | she flung open the doors,<br> All fearless she went, | and the guests did she welcome;<br> To the Niflungs she went-- | her last greeting it was,--<br> In her speech truth was clear, | and much would she speak.</p>

<p>[44. <i>Niflungs</i>: regarding the application of this term to the Burgundians cf. <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 11, and <i>Brot</i>, 17, and notes. The manuscript here spells the name with an initial N, as elsewhere, but in stanza 83 the son of Hogni appears with the name "Hniflung." In consequence, some editors change the form in this stanza to "Hniflungs," while others omit the initial H in both cases. I have followed the manuscript, though admittedly its spelling is illogical.]</p> </font>

<p>But to nought would they hearken, | and "No" said they all.</p>

<p>47. Then the daughter of Gjuki | two warriors smote down,<br> Atli's brother she slew, | and forth then they bore him;<br> (So fiercely she fought | that his feet she clove off;)<br> Another she smote | so that never he stood,<br> To hell did she send him,-- | her hands trembled never.</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[46. The warlike deeds of Guthrun represent an odd transformation of the German tradition. Kriemhild, although she did no actual fighting in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, was famed from early times for her cruelty and fierceness of heart, and this seems to have inspired the poet of the <i>Atlamol</i> to make his Guthrun into a warrior outdoing Brynhild herself. Kriemhild's ferocity of course, was directed against Gunther and especially Hagene, for whose slaying she rather than Etzel was responsible; here, on the other hand, Guthrun's is devoted to the defense of her brothers.</p> 
<p>47. Line 3 is very likely an interpolation. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5. <i>Atli's brother</i>: doubtless a reminiscence of the early tradition represented in the <i>Nibelungenlied</i> by the slaying of Etzel's brother, Bl&#156;delin (the historical Bleda), by Dancwart.]</p> </font>

<p>48.

<p>49. All the morning they fought | until midday shone,<br> (All the dusk as well | and the dawning of day,)<br> When the battle was ended, | the field flowed with blood;<br> Ere they fell, eighteen | of their foemen were slain,<br> By the two sons of Bera | and her brother as well.</p> 
<p>50. Then the warrior spake, | and wild was his anger:<br> "This is evil to see, | and thy doing is all;</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[48. Line 3 may well be spurious, for it implies that Gunnar and Hogni were killed in battle, whereas they were taken prisoners. Some editors, in an effort to smooth out the inconsistency, change "themselves" in this line to "sound." Line 5 has also been questioned as possibly interpolated. <i>Niflungs</i>: on the spelling of this name in the manuscript and the various editions cf. note on stanza 44.</p> 
<p>49. Line 2 is probably an interpolation, and the original apparently lacks a word. There is some obscurity as to the exact meaning of lines 4-5. <i>The two sons of Bera</i>: Sn&aelig;var and Solar; <i>her brother</i> is Orkning; cf. stanza 28.</p> 
<p>50. <i>The warrior</i>: Atli. <i>Thirty</i>: perhaps an echo of the "thirty warriors" of Thjothrek (cf. <i>Guthrunarkvitha III</i>, 5). Subtracting the eighteen killed by Sn&aelig;var, Solar and Orkning (stanza 49), and Vingi, killed by the whole company (stanza [fp. 518] 38), we have eleven left, as Atli says, but this does not allow much for the exploits of Gunnar and Hogni, who, by this reckoning, seem to have killed nobody. The explanation probably is that lines 4-5 of stanza 49 are in bad shape.]</p> </font>

<p>[51. <i>Five brothers</i>: the <i>Volsungasaga</i> speaks of four (not five) sons of Buthli, but names only Atli. Regarding the death of the first two brothers cf. stanza 91 and note. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza, and many editions combine lines 3-4 with stanza 52. Some insert lines 2-3 of stanza 52 ahead of lines 3-4 of stanza 51.</p> 
<p>52. Possibly a line has been lost from this stanza. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza, which is impossible unless something has been lost. <i>Gold</i>: the meaning of this half line is somewhat doubtful, but apparently Atli refers to Sigurth's treasure, which should have been his as Brynhild's brother. <i>Sister</i>: Brynhild; regarding Guthrun's indirect responsibility for Brynhild's death cf. <i>Gripisspo</i>, 45 and note.]</p> </font>

<p>Guthrun spake:</i><br> 53.

<p>Atli spake:</i><br> 54. "Go now, ye warriors, | and make greater the grief<br> Of the woman so fair, | for fain would I see it;<br> So fierce be thy warring | that Guthrun shall weep,<br> I would gladly behold | her happiness lost.</p>

<p>[53. The manuscript does not name the speaker. <i>The Volsungasaga</i> gives the speech, in somewhat altered form, to Hogni. "Why speakest thou so? Thou wast the first to break peace; thou didst take my kinswoman and starved her in a prison, and murdered her and took her wealth; that was not kinglike; and laughable does it seem to me that thou talkest of thy sorrow, and good shall I find it that all goes ill with thee." This presumably represents the correct form of the stanza, for nowhere else is it intimated that Atli killed Guthrun's mother, Grimhild, nor is the niece elsewhere mentioned. Some editions make a separate stanza of lines 4-5, Grundtvig adding a line after line 3 and two more after line 5. Other editors are doubtful about the authenticity of either line 3 or line 5.</p>

<p>57. Beiti: not elsewhere mentioned. The <i>Atlakvitha</i> version of this episode (stanzas 23-25) does not mention Beiti, and in the <i>Volsungasaga</i> the advice to cut out Hjalli's heart instead of Hogni's is given by an unnamed "counsellor of Atli." In the <i>Atlakvitha</i> Hjalli is actually killed; the <i>Volsungasaga</i> combines the two versions by having Hjalli first let off at Hogni's intercession and then seized a second time and killed, thus introducing the <i>Atlakvitha</i> episode of the quaking heart (stanza 24). The text of the first half of line 3 is obscure, and there are many and widely varying suggestions as to the word here rendered "sluggard."</p>

Regarding Gunnar's harp-playing, and his death, cf. <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, 27-30 and notes, and <i>Atlakvitha</i>, 34. <i>Toes</i> (literally "sole-twigs"): the <i>Volsungasaga</i> explains that Gunnar's hands were bound. <i>Rafters</i>: thus literally, and probably correctly; Gering has an ingenious but unlikely theory that the word means "harp."</p>

<p>[68. Line 5 is very probably a later addition, though some editors question line 3 instead.</p> 
<p>69. Guthrun suddenly changes her tone in order to make Atli believe that she is submissive to his will, and thus to gain time for her vengeance. Line 2 in the original is thoroughly obscure; it runs literally: "On the knee goes the fist if the twigs are taken off." Perhaps the word meaning "fist" may also have meant "tree-top," as Gering suggests, or perhaps the line is an illogical blending of the ideas contained in lines 1 and 3.</p> 
<p>70. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza, <i>Two shields</i>, etc.: i. e., Guthrun concealed her hostility (symbolized by a red shield, cf. <i>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</i> I, 34) by a show of friendliness (a white shield).]</p> </font>

Line 2 in the original is clearly defective, the verb being omitted. The meaning of line 3 is uncertain; the <i>Volsungasaga</i> paraphrase has: "At evening she took the sons of King Atli (Erp and Eitil) where they were playing with a block of wood." Probably the text of the line as we have it is faulty. Lines 4-5 may possibly have been expanded out of a single line, or line 5 may be spurious.]</p> </font>

<p>77. The manuscript indicates no gap (lines 1-2), and most editions make a single line, despite the defective meter: "Thy sons hast thou lost | as thou never shouldst lose them." The second part of line 2 is in the original identical with the second half of line 3 of stanza 80, and may perhaps have been inserted here by mistake. <i>Skulls</i>: it is possible that line 3 was borrowed from a poem belonging to the V&ouml;lund tradition (cf. <i>V&ouml;lundarkvitha</i>, 25 and 37), and the idea doubtless came from some such source, but probably the poet inserted it in a line of his own composition to give an added touch of horror.

<p>83. Together they sat | and full grim were their thoughts,<br> Unfriendly their words, | and no joy either found;<br> In Hniflung grew hatred, | great plans did he have,<br> To Guthrun his anger | against Atli was told.</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[82. The manuscript does not indicate the speakers. Many editions make two separate stanzas of the four lines. <i>Another light:</i> a fairly clear indication of the influence of Christianity; cf. Introductory Note.</p> 
<p>83. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a new stanza. <i>Hniflung</i>: the <i>Volsungasaga</i> says that "Hogni had a son who was called Hniflung," but the name appears to be nothing more than the familiar "Niflung" applied in general to the sons of Gjuki and their people. On the spelling cf. note on stanza 44. [fp. 530] This son of Hogni appears in later versions of the story. In the <i>Thithrekssaga</i> he is called Aldrian, and is begotten by Hogni the night before his death. Aldrian grows up and finally shuts Attila in a cave where he starves to death. The poet here has incorporated the idea, which finds no parallel in the <i>Atlakvitha</i>, without troubling himself to straighten out the chronology.]</p> </font>

<p>84. To her heart came ever | the fate of Hogni,<br> She told him 'twere well | if he vengeance should win;<br> So was Atli slain,-- | 'twas not slow to await,--<br> Hogni's son slew him, | and Guthrun herself.</p> 
<p>85. Then the warrior spake, | as from slumber he wakened,<br> Soon he knew for his wounds | would the bandage do nought:<br> "Now the truth shalt thou say: | who has slain Buthli's son?<br> Full sore am I smitten, | nor hope can I see."</p> <i>
<p>Guthrun spake:</i><br> 86. "Ne'er her deed from thee hides | the daughter of Grimhild,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[84. Line 4 may be in Fornyrthislag, and from another poem.</p> 
<p>85. The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a new stanza.</p> 
<p>The <i>Volsungasaga</i> makes line 2 part of Atli's speech.</p> 
<p>86. The manuscript does not name the speakers. It marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza, and many editions follow this arrangement, in most cases making a stanza of lines 4-5 and line 1 of stanza 87. However, line 1 may well have been interpolated here from stanza 75. Grundtvig adds after line 3: "His father he avenged, and his kinsmen fully." Some editors assume the loss of one or two lines after line 5.]</p> </font>

<p>I own to the guilt | that is ending thy life,<br> And the son of Hogni; | 'tis so thy wounds bleed."</p> <i>
<p>Atli spake:</i><br> "To murder hast thou fared, | though foul it must seem;<br> Ill thy friend to betray | who trusted thee well.</p> 
<p>87. "Not glad went I hence | thy hand to seek, Guthrun,<br> In thy widowhood famed, | but haughty men found thee;<br> My belief did not lie, | as now we have learned;<br> I brought thee home hither, | and a host of men with us.</p> 
<p>88. "Most noble was all | when of old we journeyed,<br> Great honor did we have | of heroes full worthy;<br> Of cattle had we plenty, | and greatly we prospered,<br> Mighty was our wealth, | and many received it.</p> 
<p>89. "To the famed one as bride-gift | I gave jewels fair,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[87. The manuscript marks line 2 as beginning a new stanza, and some editions make a stanza out of lines 2-4 and line 1 of stanza 88.</p> 
<p><small>8. The manuscript marks line 2 as the beginning of a stanza, and many editions make a stanza out of lines 2-4, or combine them with stanza 89. Some question the genuineness of line 4. 89. Many editions assume a gap of one line after line 3; [fp. 532] Grundtvig adds: "Bit-champing horses and wheel-wagons bright." Line 4 may be spurious. <i>Greater</i>: i. e., the silver which Atli gave Guthrun was of greater value even than the honor of receiving such royal gifts. Line 4 may be spurious.]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_532"><font size="1" color="green">p. 532</font></A></p> 
<p>I gave thirty slaves, | and handmaidens seven;<br> There was honor in such gifts, | yet the silver was greater.</p> 
<p>90. "But all to thee was | as if nought it were worth,<br> While the land lay before thee | that Buthli had left me;<br> Thou in secret didst work | so the treasure I won not;<br> My mother full oft | to sit weeping didst make,<br> No wedded joy found I | in fullness of heart."</p> <i>
<p>Guthrun spake:</i><br> 91. "Thou liest now, Atli, | though little I heed it;</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[90. Some editions mark line 3 as spurious or defective. The manuscript marks line 4 as the beginning of a new stanza. <i>The land</i>, etc.: there is much obscurity as to the significance of this line. Some editors omit or question "me," in which case Atli is apparently reproaching Guthrun for having incited him to fight with his brothers to win for himself the whole of Buthli's land. In stanza 91 Guthrun denies that she was to blame for Atli's quarrels with his brothers. The <i>Volsungasaga</i> reading supports this interpretation. The historical Attila did actually have his brother, Bleda, killed in order to have the sole rule. <i>The treasure</i>: Sigurth's hoard, which Atli claimed as the brother of Brynhild and husband of Guthrun, Sigurth's widow, but which Gunnar and Hogni kept for themselves, with, as Atli here charges, Guthrun's connivance. <i>My mother</i>: the only other reference to Atli's mother is in <i>Oddrunargratr</i>, 30, wherein she appears as the adder who stings Gunnar to death, and in the prose passages based on that stanza.]</p> </font>

<p>If I seldom was kindly, | full cruel wast thou;<br> Ye brothers fought young, | quarrels brought you to battle,<br> And half went to hell | of the sons of thy house,<br> And all was destroyed | that should e'er have done good.</p> 
<p>92. "My two brothers and I | were bold in our thoughts,<br> From the land we went forth, | with Sigurth we fared;<br> Full swiftly we sailed, | each one steering his ship,<br> So our fate sought we e'er | till we came to the East.</p> 
<p>93. "First the king did we slay, | and the land we seized,</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[91. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. It marks both lines 4 and 5 as beginning new stanzas, but line 5 is presumably an interpolation. The text of the second half of line 2 is obscure, and many emendations have been suggested. <i>Ye brothers</i>: cf. note on stanza go. <i>Half</i>: i. e., two of Atli's brothers were killed, the other two dying in the battle with Gunnar and Hogni; cf. stanza 51.</p> 
<p>92. <i>From the land</i>: this maritime expedition of Guthrun and her two brothers, Gunnar and Hogni (the poet seems to know nothing of her half-brother, Gotthorm), with Sigurth seems to have been a pure. invention of the poet's, inserted for the benefit of his Greenland hearers. Nothing further is reported concerning it.</p> 
<p>93. <i>The forest</i>: i. e., men who were outlawed in the conquered land were restored to their rights--another purely Norse touch.]</p> </font>
<p><a name="page_534"><font size="1" color="green">p. 534</font></A></p> 
<p>The princes did us service, | for such was their fear;<br> From the forest we called | them we fain would have guiltless,<br> And rich made we many | who of all were bereft.</p> 
<p>94. "Slain was the Hun-king, | soon happiness vanished,<br> In her grief the widow | so young sat weeping;<br> Yet worse seemed the sorrow | to seek Atli's house,<br> A hero was my husband, | and hard was his loss.</p> 
<p>95. "From the Thing thou camst never, | for thus have we heard,<br> Having won in thy quarrels, | or warriors smitten;<br> Full yielding thou wast, | never firm was thy will,<br> In silence didst suffer, | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p> <i>
<p>Atli spake:</i><br> 96. "Thou liest now, Guthrun, | but little of good</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[94. <i>Hun-king</i>: Sigurth, though most illogically so called; cf. <i>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</i>, 4 and note. The Volsungasaga paraphrase of line 2 is so remote as to be puzzling: "It was little to bear the name of widow." Perhaps, however, the word "not" fell out between "was" and "little."</p> 
<p>95. <i>Thing</i>, etc.: here the poet makes Atli into a typical Norse land-owner, going to the "Thing," or general law council, to settle his disputes. Even the compilers of the <i>Volsungasaga</i> could not accept this, and in their paraphrase changed "Thing" to "battle." The text of the second half of line 2 is uncertain. The manuscript leaves a blank to indicate the gap in-line 4; Grundtvig adds: "as beseems not a king."]</p> </font>

<p>Will it bring to either, | for all have we lost;<br> But, Guthrun, yet once | be thou kindly of will,<br> For the honor of both, | when forth I am home."</p> <i>
<p>Guthrun spake:</i><br> 97. "A ship will I buy, | and a bright-hued coffin,<br> I will wax well the shroud | to wind round thy body,<br> For all will I care | as if dear were we ever."</p> 
<p>98. Then did Atli die, | and his heirs' grief doubled;<br> The high-born one did | as to him she had promised;<br> Then sought Guthrun the wise | to go to her death,<br> But for days did she wait, | and 'twas long ere she died.</p> 
<p>99. Full happy shall he be | who such offspring has,<br> Or children so gallant, | as Gjuki begot;<br> Forever shall live, | and in lands far and wide,<br> Their valor heroic | wherever men hear it.</p> <font size="-1" color="green">
<p>[97. The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. Many editors assume a gap either before or after line 1. <i>A ship</i>: the burial of Norse chiefs in ships was of frequent occurrence, but the Greenland poet's application of the custom to Atli is some what grotesque.</p> 
<p>98. <i>Heirs</i>, etc.: merely a stock phrase, here quite meaningless, as Atli's heirs had all been killed. <i>Long</i>: cf. <i>Guthrunarhvot</i>, introductory prose.]</p> </font>
