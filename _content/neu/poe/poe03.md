## VOLUSPO

The Wise-Woman's Prophecy

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

At the beginning of the collection in the *Codex Regius* stands the
Voluspo, the most famous and important, as it is likewise the most
debated, of all the Eddic poems. Another version of it is found in a
huge miscellaneous compilation of about the year 1300, the *Hauksbok*,
and many stanzas are included in the *Prose Edda* of Snorri Sturluson.
The order of the stanzas in the *Hauksbok* version differs materially
from that in the *Codex Regius*, and in the published editions many
experiments have been attempted in further rearrangements. On the whole,
how ever, and allowing for certain interpolations, the order of the
stanzas in the *Codex Regius* seems more logical than any of the
wholesale "improvements" which have been undertaken.

The general plan of the *Voluspo* is fairly clear. Othin, chief of the
gods, always conscious of impending disaster and eager for knowledge,
calls on a certain "Volva," or wise-woman, presumably bidding her rise
from the grave. She first tells him of the past, of the creation of the
world, the beginning of years, the origin of the dwarfs (at this point
there is a clearly interpolated catalogue of dwarfs' names, stanzas
10-16), of the first man and woman, of the world-ash Yggdrasil, and of
the first war, between the gods and the Vanir, or, in Anglicized form,
the Wanes. Then, in stanzas 27-29, as a further proof of her wisdom, she
discloses some of Othin's own secrets and the details of his search for
knowledge. Rewarded by Othin for what she has thus far told (stanza 30),
she then turns to the real prophesy, the disclosure of the final
destruction of the gods. This final battle, in which fire and flood
overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight with their enemies, is the
great fact in Norse mythology; the phrase describing it, *ragna rök*,
"the fate of the gods," has become familiar, by confusion with the word
rökkr, "twilight," in the German *Göterdämmerung*. The wise-woman tells
of the Valkyries who bring the slain warriors to support Othin and the
other gods in the battle, of the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of
the gods, through the wiles of Loki, of the enemies of the gods, of the
summons to battle on both sides, and of the mighty struggle, till Othin
is slain, and "fire leaps high

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

about heaven itself" (stanzas 31-58). But this is not all. A new and
beautiful world is to rise on the ruins of the old; Baldr comes back,
and "fields unsowed bear ripened fruit" (stanzas 59-66).

This final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of
opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was
heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an
intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing
Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences
of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the
arguments of Finnur Jonsson, Müllenhoff and others who maintain that the
*Voluspo* is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the
tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were
nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been
converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. It
seems likely, then, that the *Voluspo* was the work of a poet living
chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the "Western Isles," in the
middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and
yet with an imagination active enough to be touched by the vague tales
of a different religion emanating from his neighbor Celts.

How much the poem was altered during the two hundred years between its
composition and its first being committed to writing is largely a matter
of guesswork, but, allowing for such an obvious interpolation as the
catalogue of dwarfs, and for occasional lesser errors, it seems quite
needless to assume such great changes as many editors do. The poem was
certainly not composed to tell a story with which its early hearers were
quite familiar; the lack of continuity which baffles modern readers
presumably did not trouble them in the least. It is, in effect, a series
of gigantic pictures, put into words with a directness and sureness
which bespeak the poet of genius. It is only after the reader, with the
help of the many notes, has--familiarized him self with the names and
incidents involved that he can begin to understand the effect which this
magnificent poem must have produced on those who not only understood but
believed it.

1\. Hearing I ask \| from the holy races,  
From Heimdall's sons, \| both high and low;  
Thou wilt, Valfather, \| that well I relate  
Old tales I remember \| of men long ago.

2\. I remember yet \| the giants of yore,  
Who gave me bread \| in the days gone by;  
Nine worlds I knew, \| the nine in the tree  
With mighty roots \| beneath the mold.

\[1. A few editors, following Bugge, in an effort to clarify the poem,
place stanzas 22, 28 and 30 before stanzas 1-20, but the arrangement in
both manuscripts, followed here, seems logical. In stanza I the Volva,
or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing.
Evidently she be longs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and
thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic
power. Holy: omitted in *Regius*; the phrase "holy races" probably means
little more than mankind in general. Heimdall: the watchman of the gods;
cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred to as Heimdall's
sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall
seems to have had various at tributes, and in the Rigsthula, wherein a
certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men, a
fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what
authority we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like
Othin (cf. Rigsthula, introductory prose and note). Valfather ("Father
of the Slain"): Othin, chief of the gods, so called because the slain
warriors were brought to him at Valhall ("Hall of the Slain") by the
Valkyries ("Choosers of the Slain").

2\. Nine worlds: the worlds of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes
(Vanaheim, cf. stanza 21 and note), of the elves (Alfheim), of men
(Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim, cf.
stanza 47 and note), of the dark elves (Svartalfaheim), of the dead
(Niflheim), and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir, cf.
stanza 37 and note, but the ninth world is uncertain). The tree: the
world-ash Yggdrasil, \[fp. 4\] symbolizing the universe; cf.
*Grimnismol*, 29-35 and notes, wherein Yggdrasil is described at
length.\]

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

3\. Of old was the age \| when Ymir lived;  
Sea nor cool waves \| nor sand there were;  
Earth had not been, \| nor heaven above,  
But a yawning gap, \| and grass nowhere.

4\. Then Bur's sons lifted \| the level land,  
Mithgarth the mighty \| there they made;  
The sun from the south \| warmed the stones of earth,  
And green was the ground \| with growing leeks.

5\. The sun, the sister \| of the moon, from the south  
Her right hand cast \| over heaven's rim;  
No knowledge she had \| where her home should be,  
The moon knew not \| what might was his,  
The stars knew not \| where their stations were.

\[3. *Ymir*: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf.
*Vafthruthnismol*, 21. in this stanza as quoted in Snorri's Edda the
first line runs: "Of old was the age ere aught there was." *Yawning
gap*: this phrase, "Ginnunga-gap," is sometimes used as a proper name.

4\. Bur's sons: Othin, Vili, and Ve. Of Bur we know only that his wife
was Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn; cf. *Hovamol*, 141. Vili and Ve are
mentioned by name in the Eddic poems only in *Lokasenna*, 26.
*Mithgarth* ("Middle Dwelling"): the world of men. *Leeks*: the leek was
often used as the symbol of fine growth (cf. *Guthrunarkvitha* I, 17),
and it was also supposed to have magic power (cf. *Sigrdrifumol*, 7).

5\. Various editors have regarded this stanza as interpolated; Hoffory
thinks it describes the northern summer night in which the sun does not
set. Lines 3-5 are quoted by Snorri. In the manuscripts line 4 follows
line 5. Regarding the sun and moon \[fp. 5\] as daughter and son of
Mundilferi, cf. *Vafthruthnismol*, 23 and note, and *Grimnismol*, 37 and
note.\]

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

6\. Then sought the gods \| their assembly-seats,  
The holy ones, \| and council held;  
Names then gave they \| to noon and twilight,  
Morning they named, \| and the waning moon,  
Night and evening, \| the years to number.

7\. At Ithavoll met \| the mighty gods,  
Shrines and temples \| they timbered high;  
Forges they set, and \| they smithied ore,  
Tongs they wrought, \| and tools they fashioned.

8\. In their dwellings at peace \| they played at tables,  
Of gold no lack \| did the gods then know,--  
Till thither came \| up giant-maids three,  
Huge of might, \| out of Jotunheim.

\[6. Possibly an interpolation, but there seems no strong reason for
assuming this. Lines 1-2 are identical with lines 1-2 of stanza 9, and
line 2 may have been inserted here from that later stanza.

7\. *Ithavoll* ("Field of Deeds"?): mentioned only here and in stanza 60
as the meeting-place of the gods; it appears in no other connection.

8\. *Tables*: the exact nature of this game, and whether it more closely
resembled chess or checkers, has been made the subject of a 400-page
treatise, Willard Fiske's "Chess in Iceland." *Giant-maids*: perhaps the
three great Norns, corresponding to the three fates; cf. stanza 20, and
note. Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and
the missing passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas
9-16), may have explained the "giant-maids" otherwise than as Norns. In
*Vafthruthnismol*, 49, the Norms (this time "three throngs" in stead of
simply "three") are spoken of as giant-maidens; \[fp. 6\] *Fafnismol*,
13, indicates the existence of many lesser Norns, belonging to various
races. *Jotunheim*: the world of the giants.\]

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

9\. Then sought the gods \| their assembly-seats,  
The holy ones, \| and council held,  
To find who should raise \| the race of dwarfs  
Out of Brimir's blood \| and the legs of Blain.

10\. There was Motsognir \| the mightiest made  
Of all the dwarfs, \| and Durin next;  
Many a likeness \| of men they made,  
The dwarfs in the earth, \| as Durin said.

11\. Nyi and Nithi, \| Northri and Suthri,  
Austri and Vestri, \| Althjof, Dvalin,  
Nar and Nain, \| Niping, Dain,  
Bifur, Bofur, \| Bombur, Nori,  
An and Onar, \| Ai, Mjothvitnir.

\[9. Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs,
running through stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section
does not begin before stanza 11. Snorri quotes practically the entire
section, the names appearing in a some what changed order. *Brimir* and
*Blain*: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested
that both are names for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in
stanza 37 in connection with the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat
the words as common rather than proper nouns, Brimir meaning "the bloody
moisture" and Blain being of uncertain significance.

10\. Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are
mentioned elsewhere. It is not clear why Durin should have been singled
out as authority for the list. The occasional repetitions suggest that
not all the stanzas of the catalogue came from the same source. Most of
the names presumably had some definite significance, as Northri, Suthri,
Austri, and Vestri ("North," "South", "East," and "West"), \[fp. 7\]
Althjof ("Mighty Thief'), Mjothvitnir ("Mead-Wolf"), Gandalf ("Magic
Elf'), Vindalf ("Wind Elf'), Rathwith ("Swift in Counsel"), Eikinskjaldi
("Oak Shield"), etc., but in many cases the interpretations are sheer
guesswork.\]

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

12\. Vigg and Gandalf) \| Vindalf, Thrain,  
Thekk and Thorin, \| Thror, Vit and Lit,  
Nyr and Nyrath,-- \| now have I told--  
Regin and Rathsvith-- \| the list aright.

13\. Fili, Kili, \| Fundin, Nali,  
Heptifili, \| Hannar, Sviur,  
Frar, Hornbori, \| Fræg and Loni,  
Aurvang, Jari, \| Eikinskjaldi.

14\. The race of the dwarfs \| in Dvalin's throng  
Down to Lofar \| the list must I tell;  
The rocks they left, \| and through wet lands  
They sought a home \| in the fields of sand.

15\. There were Draupnir \| and Dolgthrasir,  
Hor, Haugspori, \| Hlevang, Gloin,

\[12. The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas
varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise
appear in many forms. *Regin*: probably not identical with Regin the son
of Hreithmar, who plays an important part in the *Reginsmol* and
*Fafnismol*, but cf. note on *Reginsmol*, introductory prose.

14\. *Dvalin*: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes
to the dwarfs, probably accounting for their skill in craftsmanship,
while in *Fafnismol*, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the
lesser Norns. The story that some of the dwarfs left the rocks and
mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned, but unexplained,
in Snorri's Edda; of *Lofar* we know only that he was descended from
these wanderers.\]

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Dori, Ori, \| Duf, Andvari,  
Skirfir, Virfir, \| Skafith, Ai.

16\. Alf and Yngvi, \| Eikinskjaldi,  
Fjalar and Frosti, \| Fith and Ginnar;  
So for all time \| shall the tale be known,  
The list of all \| the forbears of Lofar.

17\. Then from the throng \| did three come forth,  
From the home of the gods, \| the mighty and gracious;  
Two without fate \| on the land they found,  
Ask and Embla, \| empty of might.

18\. Soul they had not, \| sense they had not,  
Heat nor motion, \| nor goodly hue;  
Soul gave Othin, \| sense gave Hönir,  
Heat gave Lothur \| and goodly hue.

\[15. *Andvari*: this dwarf appears prominently in the *Reginsmol*,
which tells how the god Loki treacherously robbed him of his wealth; the
curse which he laid on his treasure brought about the deaths of Sigurth,
Gunnar, Atli, and many others.

17\. Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section.
Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent
connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods,
Othin, Hönir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and
woman. The word "three" in stanzas 9 and 17 very likely confused some
early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. *Ask* and *Embla*: ash
and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and
woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.

18\. *Hönir*: little is known of this god, save that he occasion ally
appears in the poems in company with Othin and Loki, and \[fp. 9\] that
he survives the destruction, assuming in the new age the gift of
prophesy (cf. stanza 63). He was given by the gods as a hostage to the
Wanes after their war, in exchange for Njorth (cf. stanza 21 and note).
*Lothur*: apparently an older name for Loki, the treacherous but
ingenious son of Laufey, whose divinity Snorri regards as somewhat
doubtful. He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to
regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally
distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to
the newly created pair.\]

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

19\. An ash I know, \| Yggdrasil its name,  
With water white \| is the great tree wet;  
Thence come the dews \| that fall in the dales,  
Green by Urth's well \| does it ever grow.

20\. Thence come the maidens \| mighty in wisdom,  
Three from the dwelling \| down 'neath the tree;  
Urth is one named, \| Verthandi the next,--  
On the wood they scored,-- \| and Skuld the third.  
Laws they made there, and life allotted  
To the sons of men, and set their fates.

\[19. *Yggdrasil*: cf. stanza 2 and note, and *Grimnismol*, 29-35 and
notes. Urth ("The Past"): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is
kept green by being sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her
well.

20\. *The maidens*: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow
stanza 8. *Dwelling:* *Regius* has "sæ" (sea) instead of "sal" (hall,
home), and many editors have followed this reading, although Snorri's
prose paraphrase indicates "sal." *Urth, Verthandi and Skuld*: "Past,"
"Present" and "Future." *Wood*, etc.: the magic signs (runes)
controlling the destinies of men were cut on pieces of wood. Lines 3-4
are probably interpolations from some other account of the Norns.\]

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

21\. The war I remember, \| the first in the world,  
When the gods with spears \| had smitten Gollveig,  
And in the hall \| of Hor had burned her,  
Three times burned, \| and three times born,  
Oft and again, \| yet ever she lives.

22\. Heith they named her \| who sought their home,  
The wide-seeing witch, \| in magic wise;  
Minds she bewitched \| that were moved by her magic,  
To evil women \| a joy she was.

\[21. This follows stanza 20 in *Regius*; in the *Hauksbok* version
stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40, and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors
have attempted all sorts of rearrangements. *The war*: the first war was
that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir) seems
to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the
southern shores of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway
in opposition to the worship of the older gods; hence the "war." Finally
the two types of divinities were worshipped in common; hence the treaty
which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief among the Wanes
were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became
conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who
seem originally to have been water-deities. *I remember*: the
manuscripts have "she remembers," but the Volva is apparently still
speaking of her own memories, as in stanza 2. *Gollveig* ("Gold-Might"):
apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill
treatment being the immediate cause of the war. Müllenhoff maintains
that Gollveig is another name for Freyja. Lines 5-6, one or both of them
probably interpolated, seem to symbolize the refining of gold by fire.
*Hor* ("The High One"): Othin.

22\. *Heith* ("Shining One"?): a name often applied to wise women and
prophetesses. The application of this stanza to Gollveig is far from
clear, though the reference may be to the \[fp. 11\] magic and
destructive power of gold. It is also possible that the stanza is an
interpolation. Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is
reciting the poem, and makes it the opening stanza, following it with
stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas I ff. The text of line
2 is obscure, and has been variously emended.\]

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

23\. On the host his spear \| did Othin hurl,  
Then in the world \| did war first come;  
The wall that girdled \| the gods was broken,  
And the field by the warlike \| Wanes was trodden.

24\. Then sought the gods \| their assembly-seats,  
The holy ones, \| and council held,  
Whether the gods \| should tribute give,  
Or to all alike \| should worship belong.

25\. Then sought the gods \| their assembly-seats,  
The holy ones, \| and council held,  
To find who with venom \| the air had filled,  
Or had given Oth's bride \| to the giants' brood.

\[23. This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in
the manuscripts, for the former describes the battle and the victory of
the Wanes, after which the gods took council, debating whether to pay
tribute to the victors, or to admit them, as was finally done, to equal
rights of worship.

25\. Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something
lost after stanza 24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to
supply transitions which their hearers could generally be counted on to
understand. The story referred to in stanzas 25-26 (both quoted by
Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by
the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his
reward the sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods,
terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced Loki, who had
advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the \[fp.
12\] work was not finished in the stipulated time (cf. *Grimnismol*, 44,
note). The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew
him. *Oth's bride*: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that
Snorri refers to him as a man who "went away on long journeys."\]

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

26\. In swelling rage \| then rose up Thor,--  
Seldom he sits \| when he such things hears,--  
And the oaths were broken, \| the words and bonds,  
The mighty pledges \| between them made.

27\. I know of the horn \| of Heimdall, hidden  
Under the high-reaching \| holy tree;  
On it there pours \| from Valfather's pledge  
A mighty stream: \| would you know yet more?

\[26. *Thor*: the thunder-god, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth) cf.
particularly Harbarthsljoth and Thrymskvitha, passim. *Oaths*, etc.: the
gods, by violating their oaths to the giant who rebuilt Asgarth, aroused
the undying hatred of the giants' race, and thus the giants were among
their enemies in the final battle.

27\. Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement
of some of Othin's own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge
(stanzas 27-29). Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 29. *The horn of
Heimdall*: the Gjallarhorn ("Shrieking Horn"), with which Heimdall,
watchman of the gods, will summon them to the last battle. Till that
time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil. *Valfather's pledge*: Othin's
eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in
exchange for the latter's wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a
drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which
he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin's sacrifice of his eye in
order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of
disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several
differing versions of the story of Othin's relations with Mimir; another
one, quite incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the
manuscripts *I know* and *I see* appear as "she knows" and "she sees"
(cf. note on 21).\]

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

28\. Alone I sat \| when the Old One sought me,  
The terror of gods, \| and gazed in mine eyes:  
"What hast thou to ask? \| why comest thou hither?  
Othin, I know \| where thine eye is hidden."

29\. I know where Othin's \| eye is hidden,  
Deep in the wide-famed \| well of Mimir;  
Mead from the pledge \| of Othin each mom  
Does Mimir drink: \| would you know yet more?

30\. Necklaces had I \| and rings from Heerfather,  
Wise was my speech \| and my magic wisdom;  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
Widely I saw \| over all the worlds.

\[28. The *Hauksbok* version omits all of stanzas 28-34, stanza 27 being
there followed by stanzas 40 and 41. *Regius* indicates stanzas 28 and
29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza 22, as the
second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin
directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why
he has come to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for
knowledge regarding his doom. Her reiterated "would you know yet more?"
seems to mean: "I have proved my wisdom by telling of the past and of
your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise of the fate in
store for you?" *The Old One*: Othin.

29\. The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural
emendation based on Snorri's paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after
stanza 20.

30\. This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva,
rewarded by Othin for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1-29), is
induced to proceed with her real prophecy (stanzas 31-66). Some editors
turn the stanza into the third person, making it a narrative link.
Bugge, on the other hand, puts it \[fp. 14\] after stanza 28 as the
third stanza of the poem. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscripts, and
editors have attempted various emendations. *Heerfather* ("Father of the
Host"): Othin.\]

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

31\. On all sides saw I \| Valkyries assemble,  
Ready to ride \| to the ranks of the gods;  
Skuld bore the shield, \| and Skogul rode next,  
Guth, Hild, Gondul, \| and Geirskogul.  
Of Herjan's maidens \| the list have ye heard,  
Valkyries ready \| to ride o'er the earth.

32\. I saw for Baldr, \| the bleeding god,  
The son of Othin, \| his destiny set:

\[31. *Valkyries*: these "Choosers of the Slain" (cf. stanza I, note)
bring the bravest warriors killed in battle to Valhall, in order to
re-enforce the gods for their final struggle. They are also called
"Wish-Maidens," as the fulfillers of Othin's wishes. The conception of
the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in
very early times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was
interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition of the
swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite
human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of both
Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf.
*Gripisspo*, introductory note), *Svava* (cf. *Helgakvitha
Hjorvarthssonar*, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf.
*Helgakvitha Hundingsbana* I, 17 and note). The list of names here given
may be an interpolation; a quite different list is given in
*Grimnismol*, 36. *Ranks of the gods*: some editors regard the word thus
translated as a specific place name. *Herjan* ("Leader of Hosts"):
Othin. It is worth noting that the name *Hild* ("Warrior") is the basis
of Bryn-hild ("Warrior in Mail Coat").

32\. Baldr: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the
first of the great disasters to the gods. The story is fully told by
Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created things, saving only the
mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling \[fp. 15\]
about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to he a
sport for the gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally
unharmed thereby. Loki, the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to
Baldr's blind brother, Hoth, and guided his hand in hurling the twig.
Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf. *Baldrs
Draumar*.\]

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

Famous and fair \| in the lofty fields,  
Full grown in strength \| the mistletoe stood.

33\. From the branch which seemed \| so slender and fair  
Came a harmful shaft \| that Hoth should hurl;  
But the brother of Baldr \| was born ere long,  
And one night old \| fought Othin's son.  
34. His hands he washed not, \| his hair he combed not,  
Till he bore to the bale-blaze \| Baldr's foe.  
But in Fensalir \| did Frigg weep sore  
For Valhall's need: \| would you know yet more?

35\. One did I see \| in the wet woods bound,  
A lover of ill, \| and to Loki like;

\[33. The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in
various ways by editors, lacunae having been freely conjectured, but the
manuscript version seems clear enough. *The brother of Baldr*: Vali,
whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr's death. The day after his
birth he fought and slew Hoth.

34\. *Frigg*: Othin's wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar
myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in
*Fensalir* ("the sea-halls") symbolizes the daily setting of the sun
beneath the ocean horizon.

35\. The translation here follows the *Regius* version. The *Hauksbok*
has the same final two lines, but in place of the first \[fp. 16\] pair
has, "I know that Vali \| his brother gnawed, / With his bowels then \|
was Loki bound." Many editors have followed this version of the whole
stanza or have included these two lines, often marking them as doubtful,
with the four from *Regius*. After the murder of Baldr, the gods took
Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels of his son Narfi, who had
just been torn to pieces by Loki's other son, Vali. A serpent was
fastened above Loki's head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki's
wife, *Sigyn*, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever
the basin was full, and she went away to empty it, then the venom fell
on Loki again, till the earth shook with his struggles. "And there he
lies bound till the end." Cf. *Lokasenna*, concluding prose.\]

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

By his side does Sigyn \| sit, nor is glad  
To see her mate: \| would you know yet more?

36\. From the east there pours \| through poisoned vales  
With swords and daggers \| the river Slith.  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .

37\. Northward a hall \| in Nithavellir  
Of gold there rose \| for Sindri's race;  
And in Okolnir \| another stood,  
Where the giant Brimir \| his beer-hall had.

\[36. Stanzas 36-39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the
giants (36), the dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess
Hel (38-39). The *Hauksbok* version omits stanzas 36 and 37. *Regius*
unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. *Slith* ("the
Fearful"): a river in the giants' home. The "swords and daggers" may
represent the icy cold.

37\. *Nithavellir* ("the Dark Fields"): a home of the dwarfs. Perhaps
the word should be "Nithafjoll" ("the Dark Crags"). *Sindri*: the great
worker in gold among the dwarfs. *Okolnir* \[fp. 17\] ("the Not Cold"):
possibly a volcano. *Brimir*: the giant (possibly Ymir) out of whose
blood, according to stanza 9, the dwarfs were made; the name here
appears to mean simply the leader of the dwarfs.\]

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

38\. A hall I saw, \| far from the sun,  
On Nastrond it stands, \| and the doors face north,  
Venom drops \| through the smoke-vent down,  
For around the walls \| do serpents wind.

39\. I saw there wading \| through rivers wild  
Treacherous men \| and murderers too,  
And workers of ill \| with the wives of men;  
There Nithhogg sucked \| the blood of the slain,  
And the wolf tore men; \| would you know yet more?

\[38. Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the *Hauksbok* version.
Snorri quotes stanzas 39, 39, 40 and 41, though not consecutively.
*Nastrond* ("Corpse-Strand"): the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess
Hel. Here the wicked undergo tortures. *Smoke vent*: the phrase gives a
picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof serving
instead of a chimney.

39\. The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is
presumably an interpolation, and is lacking in most of the late, paper
manuscripts. Some editors, however, have called lines 1-3 the remains of
a full. stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines 4-5 the remains
of another. The stanza depicts the torments of the two worst classes of
criminals known to Old Norse morality--oath-breakers and murderers.
*Nithhogg* ("the Dread Biter"): the dragon that lies beneath the ash
Yggdrasil and gnaws at its roots, thus symbolizing the destructive
elements in the universe; cf. *Grimnismol*, 32, 35. *The wolf*:
presumably the wolf Fenrir, one of the children of Loki and the giantess
Angrbotha (the others being Mithgarthsorm and the goddess Hel), who was
chained by the gods with the marvelous chain Gleipnir, fashioned by a
dwarf "out of six things: the \[fp. 18\] noise of a cat's step, the
beards of women, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath
of fishes, and the spittle of birds." The chaining of Fenrir cost the
god Tyr his right hand; cf. stanza 44.\]

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

40\. The giantess old \| in Ironwood sat,  
In the east, and bore \| the brood of Fenrir;  
Among these one \| in monster's guise  
Was soon to steal \| the sun from the sky.

41\. There feeds he full \| on the flesh of the dead,  
And the home of the gods \| he reddens with gore;  
Dark grows the sun, \| and in summer soon  
Come mighty storms: \| would you know yet more?

42\. On a hill there sat, \| and smote on his harp,  
Eggther the joyous, \| the giants' warder;  
Above him the cock \| in the bird-wood crowed,  
Fair and red \| did Fjalar stand.

\[40. The *Hauksbok* version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain stanza
(44), and puts stanzas 40 and 41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza
begins the account of the final struggle itself. *The giantess*: her
name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in
*Grimnismol*, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess
and the wolf Fenrir are the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom
steals the sun, the second the moon. Some scholars naturally see here an
eclipse myth.

41\. In the third line many editors omit the comma after "sun," and put
one after "soon," making the two lines run: "Dark grows the sun \| in
summer soon, / Mighty storms--" etc. Either phenomenon in summer would
be sufficiently striking.

42\. In the *Hauksbok* version stanzas 42 and 43 stand between stanzas
44 and 38. *Eggther*: this giant, who seems to be the watchman of the
giants, as Heimdall is that of the gods and Surt of the dwellers in the
fire-world, is not mentioned elsewhere in \[fp. 19\] the poems.
*Fjalar*, the cock whose crowing wakes the giants for the final
struggle.\]

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

43\. Then to the gods \| crowed Gollinkambi,  
He wakes the heroes \| in Othin's hall;  
And beneath the earth \| does another crow,  
The rust-red bird \| at the bars of Hel.

44\. Now Garm howls loud \| before Gnipahellir,  
The fetters will burst, \| and the wolf run free;  
Much do I know, \| and more can see  
Of the fate of the gods, \| the mighty in fight.

45\. Brothers shall fight \| and fell each other,  
And sisters' sons \| shall kinship stain;

\[43. *Gollinkambi* ("Gold-Comb"): the cock who wakes the gods and
heroes, as Fjalar does the giants. *The rust-red bird*: the name of this
bird, who wakes the people of Hel's domain, is nowhere stated.

44\. This is a refrain-stanza. In *Regius* it appears in full only at
this point, but is repeated in abbreviated form before stanzas 50 and
59. In the *Hauksbok* version the full stanza comes first between
stanzas 35 and 42, then, in abbreviated form, it occurs four times:
before stanzas 45, 50, 55, and 59. In the *Hauksbok* line 3 runs:
"Farther I see and more can say." *Garm*: the dog who guards the gates
of Hel's kingdom; cf. Baldrs Draumar, 2 ff., and *Grimnismol*, 44.
*Gniparhellir* ("the Cliff-Cave"): the entrance to the world of the
dead. *The wolf*: Fenrir; cf. stanza 39 and note.

45\. From this point on through stanza 57 the poem is quoted by Snorri,
stanza 49 alone being omitted. There has been much discussion as to the
status of stanza 45. Lines 4 and 5 look like an interpolation. After
line 5 the *Hauksbok* has a line running: "The world resounds, the witch
is flying." Editors have arranged these seven lines in various ways,
with lacunae freely indicated. *Sisters' sons*: in all Germanic
countries the relations between uncle and nephew were felt to be
particularly close.\]

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

Hard is it on earth, \| with mighty whoredom;  
Axe-time, sword-time, \| shields are sundered,  
Wind-time, wolf-time, \| ere the world falls;  
Nor ever shall men \| each other spare.

46\. Fast move the sons \| of Mim, and fate  
Is heard in the note \| of the Gjallarhorn;  
Loud blows Heimdall, \| the horn is aloft,  
In fear quake all \| who on Hel-roads are.

47\. Yggdrasil shakes, \| and shiver on high  
The ancient limbs, \| and the giant is loose;  
To the head of Mim \| does Othin give heed,  
But the kinsman of Surt \| shall slay him soon.

\[46. *Regius* combines the first three lines of this stanza with lines
3, 2, and I of stanza 47 as a single stanza. Line 4, not found in
*Regius*, is introduced from the *Hauksbok* version, where it follows
line 2 of stanza 47. *The sons of Mim*: the spirits of the water. On
Mini (or Mimir) cf. stanza 27 and note. Gjallarhorn: the "Shrieking
Horn" with which Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, calls them to the
last battle.

47\. In *Regius* lines 3, 2, and I, in that order, follow stanza 46
without separation. Line 4 is not found in *Regius*, but is introduced
from the *Hauksbok* version. *Yggdrasil*: cf. stanza 19 and note, and
*Grimnismol*, 29-35. *The giant*: Fenrir. *The head of Mim*: various
myths were current about Mimir. This stanza refers to the story that he
was sent by the gods with Hönir as a hostage to the Wanes after their
war (cf. stanza 21 and note), and that the Wanes cut off his head and
returned it to the gods. Othin embalmed the head, and by magic gave it
the power of speech, thus making Mimir's noted wisdom always available.
of course this story does not fit with that underlying the references to
Mimir in stanzas 27 and 29. *The kinsman of Surt*: the wolf \[fp. 21\]
Fenrir, who slays Othin in the final struggle; cf. stanza 53. Surt is
the giant who rules the fire-world, Muspellsheim; cf. stanza 52.\]

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

48\. How fare the gods? \| how fare the elves?  
All Jotunheim groans, \| the gods are at council;  
Loud roar the dwarfs \| by the doors of stone,  
The masters of the rocks: \| would you know yet more?

49\. Now Garm howls loud \| before Gnipahellir,  
The fetters will burst, \| and the wolf run free  
Much do I know, \| and more can see  
Of the fate of the gods, \| the mighty in fight.

50\. From the east comes Hrym \| with shield held high;  
In giant-wrath \| does the serpent writhe;  
O'er the waves he twists, \| and the tawny eagle  
Gnaws corpses screaming; \| Naglfar is loose.

\[48. This stanza in *Regius* follows stanza 51; in the *Hauksbok* it
stands, as here, after 47. *Jotunheim*: the land of the giants.

49\. Identical with stanza 44. In the manuscripts it is here
abbreviated.

50\. *Hrym*: the leader of the giants, who comes as the helmsman of the
ship Naglfar (line 4). *The serpent*: Mithgarthsorm, one of the children
of Loki and Angrbotha (cf. stanza 39, note). The serpent was cast into
the sea, where he completely encircles the land; cf. especially
*Hymiskvitha*, *passim.* *The eagle*: the giant Hræsvelg, who sits at
the edge of heaven in the form of an eagle, and makes the winds with his
wings; cf. *Vafthruthnismol*, 37, and *Skirnismol*, 27. *Naglfar*: the
ship which was made out of dead men's nails to carry the giants to
battle.\]

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

51\. O'er the sea from the north \| there sails a ship  
With the people of Hel, \| at the helm stands Loki;  
After the wolf \| do wild men follow,  
And with them the brother \| of Byleist goes.

52\. Surt fares from the south \| with the scourge of branches,  
The sun of the battle-gods \| shone from his sword;  
The crags are sundered, \| the giant-women sink,  
The dead throng Hel-way, \| and heaven is cloven.

53\. Now comes to Hlin \| yet another hurt,  
When Othin fares \| to fight with the wolf,  
And Beli's fair slayer \| seeks out Surt,  
For there must fall \| the joy of Frigg.

\[51. *North*: a guess; the manuscripts have "east," but there seems to
be a confusion with stanza 50, line 1. *People of Hel*: the manuscripts
have "people of Muspell," but these came over the bridge Bifrost (the
rainbow), which broke beneath them, whereas the people of Hel came in a
ship steered by Loki. *The wolf*: Fenrir. *The brother of Byleist*:
Loki. Of Byleist (or Byleipt) no more is known.

52\. *Surt*: the ruler of the fire-world. *The scourge of branches*:
fire. This is one of the relatively rare instances in the Eddic poems of
the type of poetic diction which characterizes the skaldic verse.

53\. *Hlin*: apparently another name for Frigg, Othin's wife. After
losing her son Baldr, she is fated now to see Othin slain by the wolf
Fenrir. *Beli's slayer*: the god Freyr, who killed the giant Beli with
his fist; cf. *Skirnismol*, 16 and note. On Freyr, who belonged to the
race of the Wanes, and was the brother of Freyja, see especially
*Skirnismol*, *passim*. *The Joy of Frigg*: Othin.\]

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

54\. Then comes Sigfather's \| mighty son,  
Vithar, to fight \| with the foaming wolf;  
In the giant's son \| does he thrust his sword  
Full to the heart: \| his father is avenged.

55\. Hither there comes \| the son of Hlothyn,  
The bright snake gapes \| to heaven above;  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
Against the serpent \| goes Othin's son.

56\. In anger smites \| the warder of earth,--  
Forth from their homes \| must all men flee;-  
Nine paces fares \| the son of Fjorgyn,  
And, slain by the serpent, \| fearless he sinks.

\[54. As quoted by Snorri the first line of this stanza runs: "Fares
Othin's son \| to fight with the wolf." *Sigfather* ("Father of
Victory"): Othin. His son, Vithar, is the silent god, famed chiefly for
his great shield, and his strength, which is little less than Thor's. He
survives the destruction. *The giant's son*: Fenrir.

55\. This and the following stanza are clearly in bad shape. In *Regius*
only lines I and 4 are found, combined with stanza 56 as a single
stanza. Line I does not appear in the *Hauksbok* version, the stanza
there beginning with line 2. Snorri, in quoting these two stanzas, omits
55, 2-4, and 56, 3, making a single stanza out of 55, I, and 56, 4, 2,
I, in that order. Moreover, the *Hauksbok* manuscript at this point is
practically illegible. The lacuna (line 3) is, of course, purely
conjectural, and all sorts of arrangements of the lines have been
attempted by editors, *Hlothyn*: another name for Jorth ("Earth"),
Thor's mother; his father was Othin. *The snake*: Mithgarthsorm; cf.
stanza 5c and note. *Othin's son*: Thor. The fourth line in *Regius*
reads "against the wolf," but if this line refers to Thor at all, and
not to Vithar, the *Hauksbok* reading, "serpent," is correct.

56\. *The warder of earth*: Thor. *The son of Fjorgyn*: again \[fp. 24\]
Thor, who, after slaying the serpent, is overcome by his venomous
breath, and dies. Fjorgyn appears in both a masculine and a feminine
form. in the masculine 1t is a name for Othin; in the feminine, as here
and in *Harbarthsljoth*, 56, it apparently refers to Jorth.\]

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

57\. The sun turns black, \| earth sinks in the sea,  
The hot stars down \| from heaven are whirled;  
Fierce grows the steam \| and the life-feeding flame,  
Till fire leaps high \| about heaven itself.

58\. Now Garm howls loud \| before Gnipahellir,  
The fetters will burst, \| and the wolf run free;  
Much do I know, \| and more can see  
Of the fate of the gods, \| the mighty in fight.

59\. Now do I see \| the earth anew  
Rise all green \| from the waves again;  
The cataracts fall, \| and the eagle flies,  
And fish he catches \| beneath the cliffs.

60\. The gods in Ithavoll \| meet together,  
Of the terrible girdler \| of earth they talk,

\[57. With this stanza ends the account of the destruction.

58\. Again the refrain-stanza (cf. stanza 44 and note), abbreviated in
both manuscripts, as in the case of stanza 49. It is probably misplaced
here.

59\. Here begins the description of the new world which is to rise out
of the wreck of the old one. It is on this passage that a few critics
have sought to base their argument that the poem is later than the
introduction of Christianity (*circa* 1000), but this theory has never
seemed convincing (cf. introductory note).

60\. The third line of this stanza is not found in *Regius*. *Ithavoll*:
cf. stanza 7 and note. *The girdler of earth*: *Mithgarthsorm*: \[fp.
25\], who, lying in the sea, surrounded the land. *The Ruler of Gods*:
Othin. The runes were both magic signs, generally carved on wood, and
sung or spoken charms.\]

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

And the mighty past \| they call to mind,  
And the ancient runes \| of the Ruler of Gods.

61\. In wondrous beauty \| once again  
Shall the golden tables \| stand mid the grass,  
Which the gods had owned \| in the days of old,  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .

62\. Then fields unsowed \| bear ripened fruit,  
All ills grow better, \| and Baldr comes back;  
Baldr and Hoth dwell \| in Hropt's battle-hall,  
And the mighty gods: \| would you know yet more?

63\. Then Hönir wins \| the prophetic wand,  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
And the sons of the brothers \| of Tveggi abide  
In Vindheim now: \| would you know yet more?

\[61. The *Hauksbok* version of the first two lines runs:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The gods shall find there, \| wondrous fair,  
The golden tables \| amid the grass."

</div>

No lacuna (line 4) is indicated in the manuscripts. *Golden tables*: cf.
stanza 8 and note.

62\. *Baldr*: cf. stanza 32 and note. Baldr and his brother, Hoth, who
unwittingly slew him at Loki's instigation, return together, their union
being a symbol of the new age of peace. *Hropt*: another name for Othin.
His "battle-hall" is Valhall.

63\. No lacuna (line 2) indicated in the manuscripts. *Hönir*: cf.
stanza 18 and note. In this new age he has the gift of foretelling the
future. *Tveggi* ("The Twofold"): another name for \[fp. 26\] Othin. His
brothers are Vili and Ve (cf. *Lokasenna*, 26, and note). Little is
known of them, and nothing, beyond this reference, of their sons.
*Vindheim* ("Home of the Wind"): heaven.\]

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

64\. More fair than the sun, \| a hall I see,  
Roofed with gold, \| on Gimle it stands;  
There shall the righteous \| rulers dwell,  
And happiness ever \| there shall they have.

65\. There comes on high, \| all power to hold,  
A mighty lord, \| all lands he rules.  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .

66\. From below the dragon \| dark comes forth,  
Nithhogg flying \| from Nithafjoll;  
The bodies of men on \| his wings he bears,  
The serpent bright: \| but now must I sink.

\[64. This stanza is quoted by Snorri. *Gimle*: Snorri makes this the
name of the hall itself, while here it appears to refer to a mountain on
which the hall stands. It is the home of the happy, as opposed to
another hall, not here mentioned, for the dead. Snorri's description of
this second hall is based on *Voluspo*, 38, which he quotes, and perhaps
that stanza properly belongs after 64.

65\. This stanza is not found in *Regius*, and is probably spurious. No
lacuna is indicated in the *Hauksbok* version, but late paper
manuscripts add two lines, running:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Rule he orders, \| and rights he fixes,  
Laws he ordains \| that ever shall live."

</div>

The name of this new ruler is nowhere given, and of course the
suggestion of Christianity is unavoidable. It is not certain, how ever,
that even this stanza refers to Christianity, and if it does, it may
have been interpolated long after the rest of the poem was composed.

66\. This stanza, which fits so badly with the preceding ones, \[fp.
27\] may well have been interpolated. It has been suggested that the
dragon, making a last attempt to rise, is destroyed, this event marking
the end of evil in the world. But in both manuscripts the final
half-line does not refer to the dragon, but, as the gender shows, to the
Volva herself, who sinks into the earth; a sort of conclusion to the
entire prophecy. Presumably the stanza (barring the last half-line,
which was probably intended as the conclusion of the poem) belongs
somewhere in the description of the great struggle. *Nithhogg*: the
dragon at the roots of Yggdrasil; cf. stanza 39 and note. *Nithafjoll*
("the Dark Crags"); nowhere else mentioned. *Must I*: the manuscripts
have "must she."\]
