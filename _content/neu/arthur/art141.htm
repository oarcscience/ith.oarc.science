For alien hands<br>  Upreared them long ago, and alien tongues<br>  Spake through their silences, and alien loves<br>  Hallowed them with their presence; till the doom<br>  Down-hurtling from the wildness of the north,<br>  Drave all in rout and ruin from the land,<br>  And once again, the princes of the isle<br>  Held sovereignty within Caerlleon's halls,<br>  True sons of Britain, conquerors at the last.<br>  <br>  Great was the court of Arthur, which he held<br>  In that young month of May.  The noblest knights<br>  Of all the baronage, with their fair wives<br>  And daughters, were assembled; and nine kings<br>  Were thither come, from nine wide-spreading realms<br>  Throughout the Island of the Mighty--each<br>  In his demesne was paramount; yet they all<br>  Had homage done to Arthur, King of kings.<br>  <br>  It was Whit-Tuesday night.  The spacious hall<br>  Of banquet was ablaze with streaming flames<br>  Of torches in tall cressets wrought from gold,<br>  Of swinging golden lamps, the burning oils<br>  Whereof exhaled a cloud of spicery,<br>  Drifting like gossamer.  And sweet the scent<br>  Of rushes and bruised blossoms on the floor,<br>  And bright the silver vessels and the gold,<br>  And the jewel-heavy hanaps, with the wine<br>  Darkling and glowing ruddily like a jewel.<br>  For Arthur and that fellowship which formed<br>  A symbol of the roundness of the world,<br>  A symbol of the circling wheel of time,<br>  A symbol of the ringed eternities--<br>  The Knighthood of the mystic Table Round--<br>  Held joyous festival; their revelry<br>  Rang to the shadowy rafters, so the flags,<br>  Suspended thence, rustled with silken swish,--<br>  Some, new, unstain&eacute;d, colourful and gay,<br>  Some, torn and tattered, maculate with blood;<br>  Some, Arthur's and his princes', but the most,<br>  Wrested from ruined kings on days of blood.<br>  <br>  Presently from the da&iuml;s, satin-spread,<br>  Where sat Pendragon's son and Guenevere,<br>  His Queen of regal loveliness, on thrones<br>  Carven of cypress-wood, arose the sound<br>  Of harp-strings touched to music.  And a youth,<br>  Slender, dark-eyed, was he who smote the strings,<br>  Alarin named, of whom strange rumors were.<br>  For some men whispered he was elfin-born,<br>  Child of a faery mother, though earthly man,<br>  A good knight and a famous, fathered him.<br>  And folk told ever that the harp he played<br>  Was Taliessin's own, that he had sipped<br>  The cauldron of Caridwen,--ay, had heard<br>  Rhiannon's singing-birds.  They said he knew<br>  What songs the willow whispers to the stream<br>  When, in the eastern dark, the red moon hangs;<br>  What chant the veil&eacute;d spirits of the storm<br>  Lift in the hollow intervals of wind;<br>  What dirge the daughters of the towering wave<br>  Intone for drowned men when the sullen surge<br>  Booms loudest on the cliffs of Britain's shore.<br>  Tales, foolish tales, perchance; but this is sure:<br>  Well could he harp, well could he make the lay,<br>  And sitting on the step to Arthur's throne,<br>  He sang the love of Astrild and Locryn,<br>  And their love-dolour, with a little song<br>  He called The King's Farewell, and it was this:<br>  <br>  "Before me is a gathering of spears,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me is the frothing flood of Stour,--<br>  Behind me is delight through seven years.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear, on this day in battle I shall die;<br>  &nbsp;&nbspWhat will they do to thee when I am slain?<br>  What will they say to thee when mute I lie?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"If they cry, 'Sin,' ,remember Love is great;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;If they jeer, 'Shame' remember Love is lord;<br>  To live in him is no dishonoured state.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"And if they bring thee to the two-edged sword,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not quite comfortless amidst their hate,--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;'We loved so very well' be thy last word.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"O face, for love of me so grey with pain<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see thee but once more how glad were I!<br>  The haven of thy smile but once to gain!--<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear, it is come!  The trumpets shrill the hour!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind me is delight through seven years,--<br>  Before me is the frothing flood of Stour."<br>  <br>  Then they who held such joyance in the hall,<br>  When he had sung, were silent a brief space,<br>  Thinking of those two lovers of old time.<br>  And in the heart of Guenevere was a woe.<br>  For never could word or song be made of love,<br>  But she must think of Lancelot, and the days<br>  To be, or waste and rasure--menacing days,<br>  Certain past all prevention.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But behold,<br>  The dragon-sculptured doors at the hall's end<br>  Opening with a rush of cool night air,<br>  Scented with May, a youth in hunting-green,<br>  Entered, and bent the knee at Arthur's throne,<br>  And told how in the royal Wood of Dean,<br>  Wherein was he a forester, had appeared<br>  A wonderful white stag, than one night's snow<br>  On yesterday's green field, whiter by far.<br>  And Arthur bade a hunting be proclaimed<br>  Even for the morrow's dawning, and when the Queen<br>  Sought his permission to attend the chase,<br>  Accorded it willingly.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the dawn<br>  Glimmered through court and hall, Arthur arose,<br>  And all his nobles, and young pages deft<br>  Arrayed them for the hunt; and joyously,<br>  While yet the Severn-mists lay in the south,<br>  With tuneful winding of gay hunting-horns,<br>  With deep-voiced baying of lithe, leash&eacute;d hounds,<br>  Champing of coursers, ring of golden spurs,<br>  They galloped forth unto the Wood of Dean.<br>  <br>  But in her silken chamber, Guenevere<br>  Slept still, rapt deep in dreams.  So grew the day,<br>  And through the painted casements of the room,<br>  The sunlight filtered, coloured violet,<br>  Green, vermeil, azure; and one slender shaft,<br>  Slantingly golden, streaming on the bed's<br>  Fine ivory and white cypress, crept upon<br>  The purple counterpane, whose broidered kings<br>  Glinted to life.  And higher stole the beam<br>  Among the golden arabesques and flowers --<br>  Wrought by sweet ladies, fair and long since dead--<br>  Until it lay like something magical<br>  On the sleeping Queen's white throat,--a touch so soft<br>  And warm that in her dream the sleeper smiled;<br>  And gliding even higher, fell at last<br>  Full on her eyelids.  Guenevere awoke<br>  To marvel at the lateness of the hour,<br>  And summon her maidens.  Swiftly was she robed<br>  In folds of emerald samite, girdled close<br>  With a broad belt of gold, mantle and hood<br>  Of crimson, sewn with gems, and lined throughout<br>  With sendal, white and fine.  So, freshly fair<br>  As a spring rose first blossomed with the morn,<br>  She mounted her fleet palfrey, and in haste,<br>  With two white-breasted greyhounds, freed from leash,<br>  Darting like swallows to her right and left,<br>  With but a single damsel in attend,<br>  Rode from Caerlleon's gateway, forded Usk,<br>  And followed the broad trail of trodden grass<br>  Left by the huntsmen.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Queen approached<br>  The confines of the forest, the sharp beat<br>  Of hoofs rang out behind her, and she turned,<br>  And following on a hunter foal of bay,<br>  Stately and proud, she saw a knightly youth<br>  Who drew near swiftly, and a prince was he<br>  In comeliness and bearing, tall and straight,<br>  Fair-haired, grey-eyed.  And gaily was he clad<br>  In lustrous, yellow satins, deeply bright<br>  As with a woven sunshine; at his thigh<br>  A golden-hilted sword hung in a sheath<br>  Of patterned cordovan; of ivory<br>  His hunting-horn was carved and wrought with gold,<br>  And from his shoulders floated on the breeze<br>  A scarf of purple silk, the corners caught,<br>  Each, with a golden apple.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the youth<br>  Riding unto the Queen, saluted her,<br>  Whereto she answered smilingly: "So late,<br>  My lord Geraint, thou comest, even as I!<br>  By this hour will the chase be well advanced,<br>  And if we go to yonder rise of ground,<br>  Which overlooks the forest, we shall hear,<br>  Plainly, I think, the chime of hound and horn,<br>  And mayhap see the passing of the hunt."<br>  And they rode up the knoll and waited there.<br>  <br>  But while they hearkened to the far-off shouts<br>  Of huntsmen, and the crying of the dogs,<br>  And the thin, distance-broken bugle-calls,<br>  Lo, mounted on a hackney, from the wood<br>  A frightful dwarf came riding, in one hand<br>  Holding a knotted scourge.  Behind the dwarf,<br>  Upon a palfrey, white and spirited,<br>  Rode a fair woman gowned in gold brocade,<br>  And following her, upon a huge destrier,<br>  A mail-clad knight was seen, his lance in rest,<br>  Slung from his neck a massive, dark-red shield,<br>  Bearing a silver griffon.  And the knight<br>  Was of so mighty a stature that few men<br>  Could equal him in body, and his mien<br>  Was resolute, and in his countenance<br>  A pride illimitable was manifest;<br>  And manifest, strong passions gratified<br>  Too easily and too recklessly, by a force<br>  Of character powerful but gone astray,<br>  That so his youthfulness and comeliness<br>  Were well-nigh devastate.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightly the three<br>  Approached the hillock, and Queen Guenevere<br>  Much marveled at the great size of the knight,<br>  And she said to Geraint, "Who is yon man?"<br>  "I know not," he made answer.  Then the Queen<br>  Addressed her damsel, telling her to go<br>  And of the dwarf enquire his master's name.<br>  This did she do with all of courtesy,<br>  Adding, "It is our gracious Queen who asks,<br>  Speaking through me."  Whereat the hideous dwarf<br>  Twisted his wide mouth to an evil grin,<br>  But said no word.  Thereon the maiden turned<br>  Her horse's head towards the knight himself,<br>  Thinking to speak with him, but instantly<br>  The dwarf struck with his scourge, and though in time<br>  She flung her arm up to protect her face<br>  The blow fell full upon her gloveless hand,<br>  Making great, livid bruises, and she came<br>  Moaning to Guenevere.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sorrowfully<br>  And wrathfully said Geraint: "Pity of God!<br>  That he should strike her thus, and that the knight<br>  Make not a move to punish him!  I will go,<br>  Myself, and ask the name."  And he rode forth,<br>  And sternly charged the dwarf discover it,<br>  But mockingly was he answered, "My lord's name<br>  I will not tell to one of thy degree!"<br>  Then Geraint turned his horse towards the knight,<br>  But the dwarf screamed, "Thou shalt not speak with him!"<br>  And he raised high the scourge and smote Geraint<br>  Hard on the neck that all the flesh was bruised<br>  And striped of the scourge-lashes.  And Geraint<br>  Put hand to hilt, minded to slay the dwarf<br>  In just avengement, but bethought him swift<br>  It were poor vengeance but to slay the slave,<br>  Punishing not the master; and unarmed,<br>  How match his silken coat with the knight's mail?<br>  So he resheathed his sword and galloped back<br>  To take leave of the Queen.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grieve not, my prince,"<br>  Said Guenevere, "thine was the worthier way.<br>  Blind rage had not been valour."  But Geraint,<br>  The slow blood oozing darkly from the wounds<br>  And colouring the purple scarf he ware,<br>  Responded: "Lady, I crave thy sovran leave<br>  To follow yon knight of the griffon-shield,<br>  Whose pride I measure by his monster's words,<br>  Wherever he may go, until perchance,<br>  For pledge or loan, I may procure me arms<br>  And challenge him, and in his blood blot out<br>  The insult he hath suffered to be placed<br>  Upon thy dignity, thy maid and me."<br>  "Go!" said the Queen, "But, cousin, guard thyself;<br>  For truly there is not a goodlier knight<br>  Than thou in all the court--ay, in the land---<br>  Nor one more dear to Arthur.  And return<br>  In all the haste thou canst."  "I shall return<br>  When we are well avenged.  Lady, farewell!"<br>  And clapping golden spurs to his bay steed,<br>  He flashed away down the sun-flooded road,<br>  Where, in the farther distances, went the dwarf,<br>  The lady, and the knight.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with one hand<br>  Shading her eyes against the sun, the Queen<br>  Kept watch, until a winding of the way<br>  Hid him from view.  Then, careless of the hunt,<br>  She called her hounds, and musingly and slow,<br>  To old Caerlleon's palace came again.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> II</b> <br>  <br>  All through that day the company of three<br>  Unrestingly rode onward, and Geraint,<br>  Persistent as their shadows, followed still.<br>  Often they journeyed in broad forest-lands,<br>  Deep, cool, and very grateful; and sometimes<br>  Across wide meadows, where the flower-starred grass<br>  Billowed before the breeze; and yet again<br>  By fields of tillage, where the peasant-folk<br>  Gaped after them, awe-stricken, telling tales,<br>  Either to other, of the wondrous court<br>  Now at Caerlleon met, and of the King.<br>  By broad highway, and now by bridle path,<br>  But ever on and onward did they fare,<br>  Till, in the falling dusk, Geraint beheld<br>  Pale, clustered lights before him, and rejoiced,<br>  Thinking to find a hamlet there, and arms;<br>  But found instead a priory, nestled close<br>  Against the foremost of a range of hills.<br>  Thereinto passed the company of three,<br>  And lodged them; and therein passed Prince Geraint,<br>  And had right courteous treatment, but of arms<br>  Were none within the house of quiet life.<br>  And in the dawning, from the priory,<br>  Went forth the dwarf, the lady, and the knight,<br>  And Geraint followed them.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This second day<br>  They journeyed in the shadow of the hills,<br>  Between whose giant folds the dust-wan road<br>  Turned and re-turned, like a wild, hunted thing,<br>  Twisting and winding, doubling on itself,<br>  But fleeing ever onward.  So Geraint,<br>  Watching the sun slope down the western sky<br>  And the hills grow in umbre, thought the quest<br>  Had never end, and many times desired<br>  His own green shield of eagle-blazonry,<br>  His own good lance and hauberk.  And his mind<br>  Was filled with fancies touching on the three<br>  Who rode before him, and he saw the dwarf<br>  Turn once and gaze upon him and fall back<br>  As he would speak with him, but haughtily<br>  The master, interposing, signed him go<br>  To his place in the forefront.  But at length,<br>  After a toilsome climb to a sharp height,<br>  The prince saw that which gladdened him,--a vale,<br>  Extending beyond eye-cast, fair and wide,<br>  Of various verdancy, the eastern slope<br>  Immersed in sunshine, while the western half<br>  Already gloomed in shadow.  A rich town<br>  Lay in the valley, with long, glistening streets,<br>  And red-roofed houses, gabled and matchecold;<br>  And at the town's extermity [sic], on a crest<br>  Commanding all the country, rose the towers<br>  And bastions of a fortress, all agleam<br>  With the strong sunlight splintering on the blades<br>  And steely helmets of the men-at-arms<br>  Who thronged the walls.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing all this, Geraint<br>  Thought he had never seen a fairer town,<br>  Richer or nobler, to whatever lord<br>  It might belong; so thinking, took his way<br>  Adown the rocky hill-fall, following fast<br>  His quarry through the open city-gates,<br>  And up the thoroughfare.  Filled was the street<br>  With a great press of people--knights in mail,<br>  Ladies with hawk on wrist, stout serving-men,<br>  Pages with message.  Allwhere was heard<br>  Clangor of iron, and ring of tempered steel,<br>  Blasts of the bellows, hammering at the forge,<br>  Hissing of red-hot metal; at every door<br>  Horses were shod, swords burnished, armour washed,<br>  In bustling preparation.  But all ceased<br>  Their labor or their pleasure, when the knight,<br>  With lady and dwarf, rode up the teeming street;<br>  And all gave place before him, and with shouts<br>  Of greeting and adulation welcomed him--<br>  Some with "All hail!" and some with "Welcome, lord!"<br>  While others cried, "What knight is like to thee,<br>  Knight of the Sparrow-hawk?"  Thus he progressed,<br>  As with a conqueror's triumph, the full length<br>  Of that long street, and conqueror-like, his mien,<br>  Lordly and orgulous, and passed anon<br>  With his companions through the massive gates<br>  Of that high fortress, whence, above the crash<br>  Of ponderous bolts to-driven heavily,<br>  Thundered the warders' welcome, "Hail! All hail!"<br>  <br>  Whereat Geraint, standing a little way<br>  Apart, with satisfaction sighed and thought:<br>  "So!  This is very well!  At last I trail<br>  Yon insolent to his hold!"  Then turned to seek<br>  Some lodgment for the night, but everywhere<br>  Found only crowded inns, and hostelries<br>  Already overflowing, and no one,<br>  For charity or gold, would harbour him;<br>  And when he asked the reason--what had drawn<br>  The entire country-side into the town--<br>  Men looked at him in wonder and exclaimed:<br>  "Hear what he asks!  Fair sir, what should it be<br>  Saving the Sparrow-hawk?"  Wherefore the prince,<br>  With something of wrath for their discourtesy,<br>  But more of scorn, and with much weariness<br>  From his long ride, turned from the populous ways<br>  And districts of the city, letting his horse<br>  Choose his own way, not knowing where he went,<br>  Not caring, where all was strange; and by a lane,<br>  Sideling and unfrequented, chanced to come<br>  To the deserted outskirts.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There he saw<br>  A brook in a deep gorge, whose sloping banks,<br>  Long left attentionless, were overgrown<br>  With coarse, luxuriant weeds; and the loose soil<br>  Had slid in many places, so it lay<br>  Almost athwart the channel, that the stream,<br>  With low, complainful murmur, frothily<br>  Poured through the cramping passage, to lose itself<br>  Among the tufted beds of water-grass,<br>  Sharp-bladed, rankly growing.  A bridge spanned<br>  The narrow slake; of finest marble-stone<br>  Had it been builded, but the frost and heat<br>  Of years had wrought a change,--seamed, cracked it was,<br>  Dark-blotched with spongy moss.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ruined hall<br>  Stood on the farther side,--one great square tower<br>  With four outflanking turrets.  But of these,<br>  Two had been crumbled in an ancient war,<br>  And lay two heaps of mortar and of stone,<br>  Rounded with wash of rain and drift of sand;<br>  A third was roofless, and its parapet<br>  Tottered in mouldering sections; and but one<br>  Seemed serviceable still, like the main tower<br>  Grey with grey lichens, scarred with old assaults,<br>  And blackened with the smoke of battles done.<br>  Yet prince Geraint, letting his gaze traverse<br>  From sunken roof to sunken corner-stone,<br>  Mused how a potent charm enveloped all,<br>  Though ruinous,--yea, even thought perchance<br>  The ruin in its ruin held the charm--<br>  That unreal, veil-like beauty which the past<br>  Weaves of its phantoms, with fair, phantom hands<br>  Its monuments overspreading--a dim cloud,<br>  Intangible and golden, tenuous<br>  And light and subtle, with the sunset-glow,<br>  Redly behind; as now, behind the hall,<br>  The west was red, while, in the evening breeze,<br>  The dark-green banners of the ivy, flung<br>  Like pennons of proud warriors from the breached<br>  And broken battlements, waved wide their folds<br>  In sinuous triumph; honeysuckle-sprays,<br>  White-yellow with new bloom, dripped from the eaves,<br>  And from the matted, interlacing screen<br>  Of twisted, gnarl&eacute;d branches, came the soft,<br>  Low, slumberous, half-querulous twittering<br>  Of sleepy swallows.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamful was the scene,<br>  With such a mellow restfulness suffused,<br>  Of such a calm simplicity, that the prince,<br>  With the dusk's fragrant fingers at his heart,<br>  Forgot the wreckage of the fallen towers,<br>  Forgot the waste of fire and battering-ram,<br>  Forgot all save the swaying ivy-boughs,<br>  The gilding of the sunset, and the small,<br>  Sleep-quavering bird-notes.  "Surely here is peace,"<br>  Thought Prince Geraint, and that he spake aloud<br>  Knew not, until in bitter echoing,<br>  A voice close to him answered, "Surely, peace!<br>  Peace red with ruin, with foul deeds defouled!<br>  Not peace of honour and security,<br>  But peace of ravishment and injury--<br>  Such peace as the sword leaves and the strong hand--<br>  The peace of desolation!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Geraint,<br>  Roused from his waking dream, beheld how one<br>  Had come the lane behind him, and now stood<br>  Upon the bridge.  A man of many years<br>  He seemed, but something worse than flight of time<br>  Had aged him all too quickly, brought the stoop<br>  To his once stately figure, and the white<br>  To his loose, heavy hair.  And poorly clad<br>  He was in an old, faded satin robe,<br>  Much-mended.  Yet, despite his mean array,<br>  An air of gentle birth distinguished him;<br>  Upon him was the dignity of rank,<br>  Inbred and ineffaceable.  And he looked<br>  Now at the ruined hall, now at Geraint,<br>  And smiled with a great bitterness, and he said:<br>  "Behold, my lord, the earldom of an earl--<br>  Ivy and fallen towers and tottering walls!--<br>  And even these on sufferance!"  And the prince<br>  Was stirred with a strong pity for this man,<br>  And knew not what to do nor what to say<br>  To lighten his despair.  But presently,<br>  In a changed tone, the other spake again:<br>  "And yet, fair youth, if lodging thou hast none,<br>  Come, lodge with me to-night.  If poor the cheer,<br>  Full hearty is the welcoming, at least.<br>  My name is Lyconal; men call me earl;<br>  And earl I was in sooth, upon a time."<br>  "My lord," replied Geraint, "I give thee thanks;<br>  Most gladly will I come."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the earl<br>  Conducted him across the mouldering bridge,<br>  Up a steep path, into a small, square court,<br>  Between whose sunken flags the wild grass grew;<br>  While everywhere the ancient walls of stone <br>  Seemed soft as velvet in their tapestry<br>  Of all-concealing ivy.  Here the prince<br>  Unsaddled his spent horse.  Then suddenly,<br>  Ere he could follow where his host would lead,<br>  Down through the silence, from the upper hall,<br>  A maiden sang, and marvelous her voice!<br>  So sweet, that floating downward from above<br>  So clearly sweet, it seemed an elfin strain<br>  From out the coloured splendors of the west--<br>  A music from the sunset, disembodied,<br>  Pure melody--the full, high, soaring notes<br>  Sprung from the fieriest aur&eacute;olin<br>  That tipped the deepening crimson of the clouds;<br>  The low, rich tones from the slow-shadowing dusk's<br>  Flower-scented violet.  And still Geraint<br>  Thought ever, "Is it faery?  It is real?<br>  Oh, never voice so magical were real!"<br>  And all the wonder shone within his eyes.<br>  Earl Lyconal, with understanding smile,<br>  Waited in kindly patience, whispering,<br>  "My daughter, Enid."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song Enid sang<br>  Was an old, whimsical, half-magic rhyme<br>  Anent the Summer-fountain, and the fay<br>  Who knelt thereby with death between her lips:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a fount in faery lands<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Where stream of summer hath its rise;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;A maiden, not with mortal eyes,<br>  Kneels by the fountain, with both hands<br>  Clasping a windflower-twin&eacuted cup,<br>  Wherewith she dips the summer up.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"A knight spurred out of the wide wood;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; The sun glanced on his falchion bright,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; And on his surcoat, all bedight<br>  With broidered Grails, since for the Good<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"He labored, nor must stop nor stay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; From winning ever on the Quest<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose sweet sign glimmered on his breast--<br>  He saw the maiden by the way.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"He caught the gold glint of her hair,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the white curve of her throat;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;And all her slenderness did note;<br>  And how the summer bubbled there<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"Over her glistening finger-tips,--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;And like a spirit, died unshriven,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Had he ten souls, he must have given<br>  Them all, but once to touch her lips!<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"He felt the heart within him shrink<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;At the ling clinging of her kiss;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that very surely this<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Was death, yet only could he think<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;How, sweeter still, her mouth was sweet<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Past all belief, and none could tell<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;The glamour of her face--and fell<br>  Among the flowerets at her feet.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;"She gave him neither look nor smile,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;She gave him neither smile nor sigh;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ever paled to see him die,<br>  Nor ever glanced at him, the while<br>  She knelt, with windflower-twin&eacute;d cup,<br>  Dipping the stream of summer up."<br>  <br>  So ceased the song; yet still the music seemed<br>  To ripple in long waves across the court,<br>  As water ripples, when the willow drops<br>  A leaf in the still pool.  And Prince Geraint,<br>  Half-saddened by the fancy of the lay,<br>  Wherein Love's sum was Death, but all the more<br>  Desirous of the sight of her who sang,<br>  Signed to his host, who wordless, led him straight,<br>  In the still-singing silence, through the hall's<br>  Dark, unused, lower chamber, up a stair<br>  Built in the thickness of the masonry,<br>  Into the upper hall.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two women sat<br>  Therein at broidery-frames.  And like the earl's,<br>  Their garb was ancient satin, lusterless,<br>  Thin-worn and frayed.  Of these twain, one was old,<br>  And like the satin, faded; yet the prince,<br>  Marking the strength, the high serenity,<br>  The perfectness of peace on the old face,<br>  Whereto much suffering, met with fortitude,<br>  Had given a pale glory, like a saint's<br>  Dim, lambent aureole, thought in her youth<br>  She must have been the fairest woman known,<br>  The stateliest.  And one was but a maid,<br>  Gold-haired, brown-eyed, the colour in her cheek<br>  Soft like the sunset-colour, and her brow<br>  And throat and fingers white as lily-flowers<br>  Sprayed by a crystal fountain.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Geraint<br>  Bethought him of the fair of olden days;<br>  Those ladies, whose bright presences lend charm<br>  And witchery all-potent to the past;<br>  Those ladies, delicately belle and young,<br>  Young always and belle always, in despite<br>  Of Death's dry grasp and Time's too restless sand,<br>  Whose beauty can not die, nor age, nor wane<br>  Below perfection; crowned with amaranths,<br>  Their luminous faces, shining stilly-fair<br>  In circumambient darkness, draw for aye<br>  Our dreaming and our longing to a time<br>  Not in reality more grand than ours,<br>  Perhcance, but in its semblant grander far,<br>  For thereon lies enchantment.  So he thought<br>  Of Bronwen, the white-bosomed, for the sake<br>  Of whose sheer whiteness many a hero spilt<br>  The best blood of his heart, until for woe,<br>  Her own heart brake in twain, and now she sleeps<br>  Always on Alaw-bank; of Arianrod,<br>  Don's silver-circled daughter, whose star-throne,<br>  A splendor in the roof of summer nights,<br>  Is but a hint of what her radiance was<br>  When she was mortal; of the Flower-devised,<br>  That magic lady of the meadow-sweet<br>  And the oak-blossom, fragile as the blooms<br>  Whereof she was enfashioned for a bride;<br>  And last of all, he lingered at that maid<br>  Of soul serene, Olwen, the pure of heart,<br>  So whitely exquisite, her beauty passed<br>  Into a proverb, that a man would say<br>  In speaking of his love, "Lo, she is fair,<br>  Graceful as Olwen, at whose every step<br>  Four white trefoils upsprang!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as his thought<br>  Touched lightly on each glowing, golden name<br>  Wherewith the eld is glowing, his heart spake<br>  Ever to him of Enid: "Fair is she,<br>  Past any maid of magic or romance!<br>  Her soul is clearer than the first hour's dew,<br>  Her face is as a flower in a waste land!"<br>  And with a perfect knowledging he knew<br>  He loved her with the strength of his whole life--<br>  With all his manliness and knightliness<br>  He loved her, and would love her to the end<br>  And summing of his days, whatever she <br>  Might have for him,--love or indifference<br>  Or worse, if worse might be.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lyconal,<br>  Undreaming of the emotion of the prince,<br>  Addressed his daughter gently: "Child, go thou<br>  Into the town and quickly bring to us<br>  The best of food and liquor thou canst find,<br>  To make our cheer the greater."  And she rose,<br>  Slender and garbed in white, and when she came<br>  Into the court, a honeysuckle-branch,<br>  Low-swinging, touched her cheek, and feverishly<br>  She pressed the cool leaves to her, in a strange,<br>  And strangely sweet, confusion; while Geraint,<br>  Within the hall, thought how the shadows closed<br>  Sullenly in, how all the brightness went<br>  With her, the source of brightness.  Yet the fire<br>  In the wide-hearth&eacute;d chimney roared and flamed,<br>  And streamerwise the ruddy light-flood played<br>  Upon the antique stonework of the walls,<br>  Or gathered in patched pools upon the floor,<br>  Of such apparent density they seemed<br>  Splashings of amber liquid.  Of all this<br>  The prince was heedless; still, in fantasy,<br>  He heard one strain of faery melody,<br>  He saw one image rarely delicate;<br>  And as sometimes the burden of a song,<br>  Heard once, in lingering recurrences<br>  Runs through the mind, almost unconsciously<br>  Again repeating those same cadences,<br>  In such refrain his heart's words sang to him--<br>  "Her face is as a flower in a waste land!"<br>  <br>  Seeing their guest's abstraction, Lyconal<br>  And his good countess courteously forbare<br>  To question him about his journeying,<br>  But waited silently, until, ere long,<br>  Enid returned, with her a stalwart youth,<br>  Bearing a costrel, filled with bread and meat<br>  And flagoned wine.  And the earl bade the youth<br>  Care for the prince's horse, and went himself<br>  To see all done.  And Enid laid the board,<br>  And when all was prepared, they sat them down,<br>  The sweet-faced countess at Geraint's right hand,<br>  Earl Lyconal, at the left.  And Enid stood<br>  And served them with a graceful dignity<br>  That made the task ennobled, and Geraint,<br>  Watching her with a love-illumined gaze,<br>  Knew she was fairer in the ancient vest<br>  Of worn, white satin then ever Beale Isoud--<br>  In whose smile Tristram had his paradise--<br>  Ay, or Queen Guenevere, in richest robes<br>  Of sendals and of samites stitched with jewels.<br>  <br>  Then, the meal finished, from the room retired<br>  Mother and daughter, and Sir Lyconal<br>  Refilled the prince's goblet and his own;<br>  And so they mused a space and sipped the wine<br>  And watched the flickering fire-forms, and Geraint<br>  Could think of Enid only; till, by chance,<br>  With start of recollection, and a sense<br>  Of guilt for his forgetfulness, the prince<br>  Remembered him his quest--why he was come,<br>  What labor lay before him--and aroused<br>  Himself from reverie, and said, "Fair earl,<br>  To whom belongs the fortress, by its towers<br>  Dominating the valley?"  But the earl<br>  Tarried in answering; over his face<br>  A visible shadow crept, that all the light<br>  And genial warmth of hospitality<br>  Merged in a deep despair, and when he spake,<br>  His words were slow with pain: "To me, of right,<br>  It does belong; I built it, it was mine,<br>  And all the great, wide earldom."  "Ah, fair sir,"<br>  Queried Geraint in sorrow, "what befell<br>  To strip thee of such riches?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearken then,"<br>  Said Lyconal, "if thou wouldst learn the tale.<br>  I tell it well, seeing that I have told<br>  It over to myself so many times--<br>  How many times!  I had a brother once,<br>  Twin-born with me, less brother and more friend,<br>  So one in soul we twain.  And in a joust<br>  My brother was sore wounded, that he knew<br>  His death was near; wherefore he sent for me:<br>  'Brother, I die, yet grieve I not for that.<br>  This is my grief: Eddern, my stripling son,<br>  Soon fatherless as well as motherless--<br>  What will betide him?  Therefore, Lyconal,<br>  True brother and true friend, be thou to him<br>  A second father, be his guardian,<br>  Befriend him, counsel him, as thine own son<br>  Have ward of his estate, lest in the swift,<br>  Hot rashness of his youth, he squander all<br>  And beggar him.  Brother, to do all this<br>  Pledge me thy word!'  I pledged it, and he died.<br>  <br>  "Thus came into my house my brother's son,<br>  Eddern, scarce more than boy, whom well I loved<br>  Both for his father's sake and for his own.<br>  For he was comely--yea, and even now<br>  Hath certain claim to fairness, though much marred<br>  By long, most shameless license--and alert,<br>  Quick-witted, active bodied, swift to learn,<br>  Swifter to put in practice; yet alway<br>  Heady, too proud, reckless of all control,<br>  And sometimes cruel--faults which indulgently<br>  I charged upon his youth, telling myself<br>  Time would mend all.  But time did not amend.<br>  For, as the years sped by, his orgule waxed<br>  And ripened into insolence; still more<br>  He set at naught my counsel; nay, far worse,<br>  Allied himself with wild companions,<br>  Plunged in excesses,--he, outstripping all<br>  In profligacy and prodigality,<br>  Free liver and free lover.  And when I,<br>  Ruefully watching this my brother's son<br>  Upon our name bring tarnishment, essayed<br>  To check his imminent ruin loud he spake<br>  Against me, saying, 'Now that I am man,<br>  Give to me mine estate!'  Whereat I told<br>  Him all his father said before he died,<br>  Adding, 'Reform thee, nephew, and I will<br>  Render thee every farthing; otherwise,<br>  I can not and be faithful to my trust.'<br>  <br>  "Which plunged him into such a furious rage,<br>  He stormed me like a madman, threatening<br>  Revengement dire,--threats, which, alas, too well<br>  He fulfilled to the utterance.  Since for this,<br>  And also that I would not pleasure him<br>  With Enid for his bride (a child in years<br>  She was, not yet fifteen, though had she been<br>  A woman grown, I had not given her<br>  To such a profligate) he raised a band<br>  Of ruffian ne'er-do-wells, whom fast he bound<br>  With promises of pillage and free leave<br>  To stuff their hungry purses with the gold<br>  Of such as, for my sake, might dare oppose<br>  His usurpation; and one moonless night<br>  Four years this next September, with his troop<br>  Attacked me in the fortress thou hast seen,<br>  Wherein I lay unguarded, with few swords<br>  Upon my walls, since, maugre his wild threats,<br>  I had not dreamed of such ingratitude.<br>  So, hardly had I heard his battle-cry,<br>  When my gates inward crashed, and all the courts<br>  Filled with my nephew's men; my men were slain,<br>  And I was taken prisoner, and my wife<br>  And daughter dragged before me.  Then he spake,<br>  The son of Nudd, my brother, 'Hear me, earl:<br>  I grant thee one last opportunity<br>  To avert disgrace--give me the maid I love,<br>  My cousin Enid.'  Ere I could refuse,<br>  My daughter took the answer from my lips,<br>  With straight, white fearlessness, 'Not while I live!'<br>  'Go, then!' he cried; 'In the old, wasted hall,<br>  Built by our forbears in an age long past,<br>  Take up your residence.  In poverty<br>  Abide, ye three; for though, for bond of blood,<br>  I will not slay you, nathless, ye shall know<br>  The heaviness of my hand!  And it may be<br>  The slowly-crawling years, lean, hard with want,<br>  And sick with memory of other days,<br>  Will bring me ampler vengeance than your deaths,<br>  With Death's enfranchisement!  Go now!  Away!'<br>  <br>  "And outcast went we through our castle-gates<br>  Into the town.  And knots of people stood<br>  Along the way, weeping and sorrowful--<br>  My friends--but impotent, silent from fear,<br>  For Eddern's men were allwhere; and if once<br>  An arm were raised to help us, swift and sure<br>  The hired sword did its work.  So did we come<br>  To this old hall, and here have we abode.<br>  And though, in my first madness, I had thought<br>  To raise the land against him, soon I found<br>  Such hopes were vain, for though they pitied me,<br>  The goodmen, and some loved me, when I spake<br>  Of armed reprise, ever they edged away<br>  With talk of wives and daughters--how they could<br>  Not jeopardize their safety.  Others' wrongs<br>  Are easily forgiven, and the crime<br>  Of one in power men willingly condone.<br>  <br>  "Moreover, with sure craft, my nephew used<br>  Unwonted latitude in all the laws<br>  He made for government, and privileges<br>  Unheard-of, gave the rabble.  For this cause,<br>  And also that he is a mighty man<br>  Of war, of reckless valiance, hard of stroke,<br>  With scarce a match in tourney, therefore, they,<br>  The fickle mob, with facile c&oacute;mpliance,<br>  Bowed to his will; ay, more, they gradually grew<br>  To pride them on the prowess of their earl,<br>  For so they came to call him, in despite<br>  Of my still living.  Likewise, as he rose<br>  In their regard, I sank, for that is law;<br>  And so it fortuned, in the very ones<br>  Who owed me most, and loved me best, I thought,<br>  Little by little I perceived a change,--<br>  Less reverence, more of pity, and from that<br>  To less of pity, and a faint contempt<br>  For wrongs now wearisome--I, come to this,<br>  I, Lyconal, once lord of a broad land!<br>  <br>  "And thus, fair youth, well on to four slow years<br>  Have halted by; yet still that shameful night<br>  Burns in my brain.  Never shall I forget<br>  That night's humiliation till I die,--<br>  Who knows, mayhap not then.  And when I think<br>  Upon my wife and daughter, all I have<br>  To love in the wide world--what they have lost<br>  Of comfort and of luxury, and how<br>  They suffer here in poverty, nay, want--<br>  Then am I like to die in my wanhope.<br>  Although it is a truth, that they, on whom<br>  Privation hath borne hardest, in their turn,<br>  With some high fortitude that I have not,<br>  Have borne it best--so uncomplainingly,<br>  So cheerfully, with such firm bravery--<br>  Often I shame me of my violence.<br>  <br>  "Now I am old; my dear wife, too, is old.<br>  For us there can not be much more of woe,<br>  If woe outlive not life.  And in that chance<br>  Would I rejoice, but that I think again<br>  Of my sweet daughter, Enid.  I, once gone,<br>  Mine arm, however withered, once removed,<br>  Who then will guard her from the wolfish world?<br>  Who then will cherish her in these dark days<br>  Of lawlessness and many wandering lusts?<br>  Her fineness and her fairiness--weak indeed<br>  Must such defenses be.  And knowing this,<br>  How often have I wished I had a son<br>  To fight his sister's battles, to protect<br>  And foster her, the flowering of my race!<br>  Nay, nor to stop with that; but with my blood<br>  Singing a song of vengeance in his veins,<br>  To give once more my banner to the wind,<br>  To sound once more my cry before the walls<br>  Of mine own castle, to remaster it,<br>  To slay the traitor in the midst thereof,<br>  To lift again my house to its estate!"<br>  <br>  And with the final word, the good earl's voice,<br>  Vibrant with feeling hardly held in check,<br>  Pealed clarionwise, as if himself had been<br>  Attacker and avenger, with the strength<br>  And warriorhood of other days, when oft<br>  He led his men into the thickest press,<br>  A shatterer of the foe!  And ere the light<br>  Of visionary triumph could grow dim<br>  Within his eyes, he saw that Prince Geraint<br>  Was watching him intently, with a strange<br>  And concentrated eagerness of gaze.<br>  Earnestly asked the prince: "Then is the man<br>  Who lords it now in yonder fortress-hall--<br>  Yea, even he who but this afternoon,<br>  Bearing a silver griffon on red shield,<br>  While all men hailed him as a conqueror,<br>  Did ride thereto with lady and with dwarf--<br>  Is he, in truth, thy nephew, noble earl?"<br>  "In very truth," said Lyconal, wondering,<br>  "None other, none but Eddern."  "God be thanked!"<br>  Cried then Geraint.  "So do thy wrongs and mine<br>  Cleave to a single man, and with one stroke<br>  Will I avenge us all!"  And in the surge<br>  Of his exultancy, he whipped his sword<br>  Out from the figured scabbard, and it seemed<br>  A blade of fire, so fast the streaming light<br>  Poured from its edge.  "Look!  Look!" he cried again,<br>  "The sword of thy revenge, Sir Lyconal!"<br>  <br>  And then to the bewildered earl he spake<br>  The purpose of his coming, in detail<br>  Told of the outrage done unto the Queen<br>  Through the Queen's damsel, how himself received,<br>  From the dwarf's hand, the insult of the blow<br>  Of which upon his neck the stripes were blue,<br>  While Eddern, son of Nudd, permitted all.<br>  "And since I could not  punish him at the time,<br>  These two days have I followed, and I find,<br>  Now, that the man who hath despoil&eacute;d thee,<br>  And the uncourteous knave whose arrogance<br>  Dared to indignify even the Queen,<br>  Are one man and the same; wherefore I say,<br>  When meeting him as Guenevere's champion,<br>  On thy cause, too, will I encounter him,<br>  And in one battle, with one selfsame sword,<br>  If Fortune speed me, will I vanquish him,<br>  And from him force the reparation due<br>  Unto our sovran Lady and unto thee.<br>  My name I have not told thee, yet it is<br>  Full fitting thou shouldst know; I am Geraint,<br>  King Erbin's son of Devon, and a knight<br>  Of Arthur's court."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hearing, Lyconal,<br>  Seizing the prince's hand, with hearty joy<br>  Clasped it and said: "Do I then see Geraint?--<br>  Geraint of Devon?  Ah, fair youth, I knew<br>  Thou wert of noble parage--manifest<br>  Is that made by thy bearing--yet never dreamed<br>  That thou shouldst stand so close beside the throne<br>  As Erbin's son, the cousin of the King.<br>  How often have I heard high things of thee!--<br>  How, foremost ever in the tourney-fray,<br>  No less within the fiercer shock of war,<br>  The golden eagles of my lord Geraint<br>  Wing to the victory!  Heard have I, too,<br>  Of thy great gentleness and courtesy,<br>  Which are the crown of knighthood!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, fair sir,"<br>  Answered Geraint, "do we not speak of these.<br>  Rather devise how earliest, in just quarrel,<br>  I may engage with Eddern."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyconal<br>  Pondered awhile, and at the last he spake<br>  Slowly, as one perplexed: "Thus stands the case:<br>  My nephew comes from Narberth, whither he went<br>  A sennight since, for there a prince let cry<br>  A tournament, the circlet-prize whereof<br>  The shout goes Eddern won; he is well-made,<br>  Large-bodied as thou dost know, of tireless strength,<br>  Valiant to recklessness.  Now he is come<br>  Again, no whit too soon, since on the morn,<br>  Even to-morrow morn, himself will hold<br>  A princely tournament, which men have named<br>  The Tourney of the Sparrow-hawk, for there,<br>  Shining across the meadowed tilting-field,<br>  Two fork&eacute;d shafts of silver will be set,<br>  On them a silver rod, and thereupon,<br>  A sparrow-hawk of gold, destined to her<br>  Whose beauty by her champion's chivalry<br>  Shall be proved paramount.  And all the knights<br>  That thou hast seen--it is this cause which fills<br>  My town with folk, making the streets to sound<br>  With clang of arms--well-harnessed and well-horsed,<br>  Will ride into the meadow, and with each<br>  The lady whom best he loves.  There will they hold<br>  Contention for the golden sparrow-hawk,<br>  On one part, Eddern and his vassal-knights,<br>  And on the other, all who from afar<br>  Have journeyed to strive against them.  Unto all<br>  Applies one ruling: no knight may contend<br>  Saving his love come with him.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These two years<br>  The tourney hath been held, hath Eddern gained<br>  The golden gree, for few enough there are<br>  Who can endure his stroke.  And if this year<br>  He gain it once again, then will no more<br>  Be held the tournament, and he will be<br>  Knight of the Sparrow-hawk from that time forth<br>  Entitled, though already some do call<br>  Him so in compliment.  He will desire<br>  His lady to take the hawk, saying to her:<br>  'Fairest of women art thou; wherefore, this year<br>  The prize should long to thee, as it hath longed<br>  These two years previous.  If any will<br>  Deny thee, let him keep him well from me!'"<br>  "Then will <i> I</i>  make denial!" said Geraint,<br>  "So must he battle with me!  Blade to blade,<br>  Shield against shield--I ask no more than this!<br>  I have my horse, and if I may have arms<br>  As loan from thee, I will defy him straight,<br>  And strength to strength, undo him if I may!"<br>  "Nay," answered Lyconal, "thou dost forget<br>  The rule of which I spake.  Arms shalt thou have;<br>  Nathless, thou mayest not joust; nor dame nor maid<br>  Is in thy company.  No knight may joust,<br>  But if the one whom best in the wide world<br>  He loves, be at the field."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat there fell<br>  A pause that grew in silence, and Geraint<br>  Thought of the maiden Enid, whom he loved,<br>  Only, in all the world; and swiftly clear,<br>  A great delight raced through him--dared he hope<br>  That <i> she</i>  would go with him?  And yet to ask<br>  For her thus hastily, without one word,<br>  Even, of wooing--surely that were wrong,<br>  Worse than discourteous; and yet again,<br>  The tourney-law must needfully be observed,<br>  If he would meet her foe.  So Prince Geraint<br>  Debated with himself, but rose at last,<br>  And leaned across the table to the earl,<br>  And spake with quiet manfulness: "My lord,<br>  The lady whom alone in all the world<br>  I love, is here, within these towers of thine,--<br>  Thy daughter, Enid.  Sooth, I never saw<br>  Her brightness till this day; but this I know,<br>  That truly never hath man loved a maid<br>  As I love her; her gentleness, her grace,<br>  Passing all others'--as a miracle<br>  They seem to me, for earthly maid too fair.<br>  Thou knowest me, who I am.  Wherefore if thou<br>  Couldst give me Enid to wife (though I must seem<br>  In very truth presumptuous, that I ask<br>  Thy one great treasure), fortuned it I lose<br>  To-morrow battle and life, still would she be<br>  Unsullied as before; and should I win,<br>  Then would I take her unto Arthur's hall,<br>  Make her my bride, and set mine every thought<br>  To increase her worship and her happiness.<br>  And I would love her to my length of days,<br>  And care for her as no man else could care,<br>  However worthier.  I would excel<br>  All men in my great love's true tenderness.<br>  That may I promise thee.  Yea, should I fail<br>  Therein but once, then might high God requite<br>  Me with deserv&eacute;d punishment,--a shame<br>  To knighthood and to manhood!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so!"<br>  Answered Earl Lyconal, "I could not find<br>  A better husband for her--nay, nor ask<br>  A better--than Erbin's son.  So do I troth<br>  To thee my daughter, Enid.  I would say<br>  Honour her with the honour that is due<br>  Such excellence as hers, but knowing thee,<br>  I am content.  And now, my lord Geraint,<br>  We must take counsel how we can restore<br>  Mine ancient armour, weakened with disuse,<br>  Broken, I fear.  No time have we to lose;<br>  For the night latens fast, and by the prime<br>  Thou must be entered in the tilting-field."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> III</b> <br>  <br>  While yet the eastern hills were pale with dawn,<br>  High in the breeze-swept turret where he lay,<br>  Geraint arose, and armed him for the fight<br>  In Lyconal's armour, and with steps that clanged<br>  Upon the stone-hewed stair, betook himself<br>  To the small courtyard to make ready his horse,<br>  Stoutly, against the combat.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it chanced<br>  That Enid, passing through the darksome hall,<br>  Came to the court's low portal, where she saw<br>  The young knight all in armour, saw his steed<br>  Harnessed for war and ready to depart.<br>  And Enid thought, "Is he so fain to fare?"<br>  And thought again, "Why must he fare so soon?"<br>  Thrilled with a shy, vague sorrow, though she knew<br>  Not yet her love for him.  And hesitant<br>  She stood a space; then lightly stepped outside<br>  Upon the old grey porch, and slowly said,<br>  With wistfulness unpurposed in her tone,<br>  "So soon to go, fair lord?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat Geraint,<br>  Uplooking, saw her there, and his young love<br>  Leaped in his eyes at the sweet sight of her!<br>  For framed she was in somber ivy-sprays,<br>  And crowned with closed, white honeysuckle blooms!<br>  And all the dawn seemed shining on her brow,<br>  And all the court seemed brimming with a light<br>  That had not been before!  "Not to go far,<br>  Sweet maid," replied the prince, and at her words<br>  With joyance did his heart grow clamorous,<br>  "But to the tilting-field."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Enid knew<br>  Not what the speech betokened, and she felt<br>  A wonderment exceeding, and she said,<br>  "And wilt thou, O my lord, enter the fray?"<br>  Then Geraint knew that she had not been told,<br>  And he stood mute and saddened, and in shame<br>  Of that which he intended.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But behold,<br>  Into the courtyard came Sir Lyconal<br>  And saw the twain.  Straightway he went to them,<br>  And placed in Prince Geraint's his daughter's hand;<br>  And while she blushed uncomprehendingly,<br>  Startled, wide-eyed, her father said: "My child,<br>  I have not yet informed thee that last night<br>  I did betroth thee to this youth, who now<br>  This morn, will fight with Eddern, our common foe.<br>  Within the hour do we accompany him<br>  Down to the meadow, where thyself shall be<br>  In all men's sight the one whom best he loves.<br>  And if he win the battle, Enid mine,<br>  Then will he take thee unto Arthur's court<br>  And wed thee with all honour.  Cause indeed<br>  Is there for naught save pride in this alliance,<br>  For he is son of Erbin, Devon's king,<br>  Geraint, cousin to Arthur.  Thou has heard<br>  Me speak full often of him in high praise."<br>  <br>  Which saying, Lyconal passed within the hall.<br>  Again they were alone.  And Enid said<br>  Never a word and drew her hand away.<br>  Her face held a white wonder, and her eyes<br>  Had depths no man might fathom.  Straight and still,<br>  Scarce seeming mortal, in the awakening hush<br>  Of the new day she stood, the first long ray<br>  Of the sun, bright on her temples.  And Geraint,<br>  Waiting in vain for but one word, one glance,<br>  Looked forward to the emptiness of life<br>  Which must, without her, be forever his;<br>  And in the shadow of those sunless years,<br>  Drearily put the hoping from his heart,<br>  And curbed his longing, and very gently said:<br>  <br>  "I see it is displeasing unto thee.<br>  Forgive me that I thought--ay, truly thought--<br>  Thou knewest all, perchance not disinclined.<br>  Well am I ware (and was ware at the time!)<br>  That I had in my mind a shameful thing<br>  (Which still I would have done!)--to make thee mine,<br>  Unwooed, unwon, to serve mine own delight<br>  By taking thee, all loveless, as a bride,<br>  Thy will not free, constrain&eacute;d.  No excuse<br>  Have I to offer but my love for thee;<br>  Howbeit, Love himself can not excuse<br>  The bound of my presumption.  O my dear,<br>  Now dearest when I shut me from thy smile,<br>  Forgive me if thou canst!  Yet must I crave<br>  One little boon.  Thou knowest the tourney-law,<br>  And how, if I will battle with the man<br>  Who hath so injured thee, I must comply<br>  With that same law.  Wherefore I ask thee, be<br>  My lady for this day, and if I win--<br>  And win I will or die--that very hour,<br>  Out from the tilt-yard will I ride away,<br>  Giving thee freedom to bestow thy heart<br>  Upon some happier man of thine own choice,--<br>  Unbidden, uncompelled.  And afterwards<br>  I shall not come again--I shall not see<br>  Thee ever any more--not any more<br>  Trouble thee with my presence, though alway<br>  Mine eyes see nothing but thy golden hair,<br>  Mine ears hear nothing but thy magic voice<br>  Singing of Faerie.  Only this I claim<br>  Ever as mine--my memory of thee;<br>  Thou wilt not bid me to put that away<br>  And make me, to the utterance, desolate!"<br>  <br>  And having said, he thought if he might once<br>  Kiss just her finger-tips, he would not ask<br>  More than that little heaven!  But unto him<br>  Amazed, not daring to believe what wrought<br>  The strange, new, subtle marvel in her smile,<br>  Enid turned slowly, and these words she spake:<br>  "My love, my knight, true lover and true knight,<br>  I love thee well," and kissed him on the lips!<br>  <br>  And not within the soul of Prince Geraint<br>  Had burned a stronger self-transforming flame,<br>  Springing toward all high things, when in the blaze<br>  Of altar-tapers, through the silent hours--<br>  Silent, but were they stirred with presences?--<br>  A candidate for knighthood, he had kept<br>  The mystic vigil which should purify<br>  And cleanse him to a fittingness to take<br>  The strait, stern vows of Arthur's chivalry,<br>  Than now this morn within his soul there burned,<br>  When kneeling in a shrine not served of hands,<br>  When kneeling in the priestless fane of Love,<br>  Whose altar is the holiest in the world;<br>  When from himself he was so lifted up<br>  That all his homage towered to one fair height<br>  And all intention streamed to one resolve--<br>  By conduct ever nobler, knightlier,<br>  To prove Love's grace was not too ill bestowed,<br>  To prove, so far as any might deserve<br>  Such grace, he would deserve it, by his life.<br>  <br>  So they went forward to the tilting-field,<br>  Lyconal and his countess, following them,<br>  Geraint and Enid.  And the ways were dense<br>  With motley press of people--men-at-arms<br>  And craftsmen of the guilds and serving-folk,<br>  Granted a holiday; and burgesses,<br>  Prosperous merchants clad in costly silks,<br>  With their stout, comely wives and cherry-cheeked,<br>  Beribboned daughters; and as white of throat<br>  And slim of waist as maidens, their long hair<br>  Perfumed and curled, young pages to the great,<br>  Bright in their broideries and golden chains,<br>  Vivid in purple stuffs and damassins.<br>  Like to the sea, the ever-eddying throngs<br>  Billowed and surged; and even as the sea<br>  Is cleft by the sharp, spume-upcasting prow,<br>  Cleft were the crowds, when haughtily and slow,<br>  His squire behind him bearing lance and shield,<br>  His lady on her palfrey at his side,<br>  Upon a great destrier, caparisoned<br>  In colour-flaunting silk, himself in mail<br>  And plum&eacute;d helm, a knight adventurous<br>  Passed to the tournament.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, at length,<br>  They saw a meadow jewell&eacute;d with the dew,<br>  Besprent with tiny blooms of gold and white.<br>  And there the lists were set, the barriers<br>  Defined, and dazzling, at one end thereof,<br>  Upon a silver rod, the sparrow-hawk<br>  In its small, golden body caught the gold<br>  Of the new sun, and like a tiny sun<br>  Flamed with a golden glory athwart the field.<br>  And round the meadow were pavilions gay<br>  Of silks of various colours; and of these,<br>  The midmost and the largest was of blue,<br>  The brightest azure, and a banner streamed<br>  Therefrom, wrought with a sparrow-hawk of gold.<br>  And Lyconal said, "There does my nephew bide."<br>  And who could tell the splendor of the knights,<br>  In gorgeous pageantry around the lists<br>  Riding with curvet, bound, and caracole?--<br>  The paintures and the blazonings of their shields,<br>  The colours of their surcoats, of their arms,<br>  The tinctures of their favours, veils and sleeves,<br>  The trappours of their steeds?  There were employed<br>  All marvelous hues and fair--scarlet and green,<br>  Flame-coloured, indigo, and party-tints,<br>  Deep-hearted crimson and clear azure-blue,<br>  And much of silver, and even more of gold.<br>  And how to tell the glitter and the show,<br>  The flash of jewels, the glance of purple silks,<br>  Whiteness of ermine, fulgor of cisclaton,<br>  Shimmer of samite, sheen of woven gold,<br>  And, fairer far, the sheen of golden hair,<br>  Vermeil of lips, azure of laughing eyes,<br>  Whiteness of throat, of bosom, and of brow--<br>  The fairness of fair ladies, damsel, dame,<br>  Matron and supple maid, where, from the tiers<br>  Of silk-spread, cushioned seats, they viewed the field?<br>  All was such colour, brilliance and estate,<br>  All was such joyance and great merriment,<br>  That Prince Geraint, beholding this array,<br>  Thought he had seen no goodlier ordinance<br>  At castle Lonazep, nor at Surluse<br>  When Galahalt of the High Heart let cry<br>  The seven-days tournament, whose rumor drew<br>  Kings from afar and princes from out-isles.<br>  <br>  But even while his admiration paid<br>  To each detail the praise well-merited,<br>  Still he remembered how this lavishness,<br>  This pomp, this many-hued magnificence,<br>  Was of an ingrate's giving, and he turned<br>  And spake to Lyconal: "Most noble earl,<br>  All this which in itself is admirable,<br>  But which the treason of the usurper stains,<br>  Is thine of right, and shall be thine again,<br>  Saving I die."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the barriers<br>  Came pursuivants, and shrilly blew to field.<br>  Forthright, by opposite ways, into the lists<br>  Two squadrons rode, whereof in one were ranged<br>  All errant knights, who, journeying from afar,<br>  Sought to increase their worship and renown;<br>  While from the other, marshalled in serried ranks,<br>  The vassal-knights of Eddern fronted them,<br>  Though he himself came not.  Which noticing,<br>  Lyconal said, "Prince, take no part in this;<br>  Await my nephew's entrance."  As he spake,<br>  With mighty shock of battle the lines met<br>  In middles of the field.  There many a spear<br>  To-shivered, many a horse plunged riderless,<br>  And headlong many a knight was hurled to earth,<br>  Among the broken flowers and sodden grass,<br>  Beneath the trampling hoofs of wounded steeds.<br>  Hither and thither flowed the battle-tide,<br>  One party now ascendant, and again,<br>  The other; so, with victory pendulous,<br>  They fought unceasingly two hours and more,<br>  Until at last, disparply, overborne,<br>  The errant knights were driven from the field,<br>  And Eddern's men had triumphed.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once more,<br>  After the exultation died away,<br>  The heralds blew to field, and instantly<br>  Fell an expectant hush.  And Prince Geraint<br>  Leaped lightly to the saddle, and his lance<br>  Placed in the rest.  Then Enid came and stood<br>  Beside him, and unbound the folded width<br>  Of silk which was her wimple, and with hands<br>  That trembled, gave it him, speaking so low<br>  Her words he just could hear, "O knight of mine,<br>  I have naught else to give thee; wilt thou wear<br>  This as my favour?"  Joyously the prince,<br>  Binding about his arm the glistening silk,<br>  Answered, and gently: "See!  I wear it here<br>  Upon my sword-arm.  It will render me<br>  Invincible, for Love empowers it;<br>  Though my foe have the strength of twenty men,<br>  He hath not strength to overcome me now!"<br>  <br>  Straightway behold, forth from the azure tent<br>  Rode Eddern, son of Nudd.  Azure and gold<br>  Were his accoutrements, his shield's device,<br>  A golden sparrow-hawk.  His greaves were light<br>  Yet strong, and highly polished; triple steel<br>  Was woven in the mail which covered him;<br>  And from his burnished helm uprose a crest<br>  Of three bright-yellow plumes.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With arching neck<br>  And all of stately slowness, his destrier,<br>  In yellow sendal housed, bordured with blue,<br>  Stepped through the lists, and great was the acclaim<br>  Attending the knight's progress.  Lance in rest,<br>  He rode the meadow's length and drew in rein<br>  Beside the shafts of silver.  Then to him,<br>  Upon her fair, white palfrey, with the dwarf<br>  Walking close to her stirrup, came the one<br>  Whom best he loved, and Eddern took her hand<br>  And spake that all might hear: "The loveliest<br>  Of women art thou; wherefore, take down the prize,<br>  This sparrow-hawk of gold.  It is the meed<br>  Of thy surpassing beauty.  If any will<br>  Forfend thee, he must answer with his life!"<br>  <br>  But Geraint interposed: "Not unto thee,<br>  Lady, belongs the prize, for if it be<br>  The meed of beauty, then must it belong<br>  Unto this maiden fairer far than thou--<br>  Fairer, more courteous, and lovelier!--<br>  And that will I maintain with my heart's blood!"<br>  <br>  And Eddern looked upon him in amaze.<br>  He did not recognize him; for who would<br>  Have recognized the youth of yesterday,<br>  Clad then with satin and with purple silk,<br>  In this tall knight in ancient, battered arms?<br>  And in that first glance seeing but the arms--<br>  The uncouth helm, the ventail worn and old,<br>  The rusted hauberk, with its broken rings,<br>  The cumbrous greaves, the antique, dinted shield<br>  Wherefrom long since the painture had been rased,<br>  Swiftly his wonderment passed into scorn<br>  And scornfully a sneer formed on his lips.<br>  But, on an afterthought, looking beyond<br>  To see what lady this too reckless youth<br>  Had vaunted fairer, met his cousin's eyes--<br>  His cousin Enid's !--met Sir Lyconal's<br>  Bitter, accusing gaze, saw Lyconal's wife,<br>  And understood it was their champion<br>  Who challenged him!  And with a violent wave<br>  Of anger crimsoning his face, he cried,<br>  "Then guard thee from thy death!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat they drew<br>  Apart an acre's space, feutred their spears,<br>  Clapped spurs unto their steeds, and with the sound<br>  Of thunder melled together, that the lance<br>  In each man's hand brake even to the haft.<br>  Then Lyconal served Geraint a second spear,<br>  And so the dwarf served Eddern, and again<br>  In onslaught furious, with the fearful shock<br>  Of warring winds, they met, and yet again,<br>  Three sets of lances shivering to bits.<br>  But for the fourth encounter, the good earl<br>  Bare to Geraint a spear of wondrous strength,<br>  With a great, flawless shaft and a strong point,<br>  Well-tempered and well-sharpened: "Prince, behold<br>  The lance I held what day I was made knight,<br>  Many long years ago.  It may endure<br>  Where others fail; take it and strike him down!"<br>  <br>  Aiming at Eddern's shield, Geraint spurred hard,<br>  And countering, again his foeman's spear<br>  To splinters flew, but Lyconal's lance held fast,<br>  And cleft the shield in twain and brake the mail<br>  And burst the girths, that down from his destrier,<br>  Saddle and all, Eddern was dashed to earth.<br>  <br>  But he rose, raging.  Unto him Geraint,<br>  Quickly dismounting, casting shield away<br>  That he might have no vantage in the fight,<br>  Rushed, and each drew his sword, and fiercely smote<br>  Upon the other's helm, that sparks of fire<br>  Sprang from the clashing of the steel on steel<br>  In the grim rain of blows.  With stroke and foyne,<br>  Tracing, traversing, now on the right hand,<br>  Now on the left, they fought like more than men,<br>  And neither could prevail, so equally<br>  Were they twain matched.  Their helms were split and crushed,<br>  Their ventails rent; their hauberks, all to-hacked,<br>  Hung on them in long shreds; their arms grew faint<br>  With their unceasing travail, and their sight<br>  Dim, through a mist of blood.  Then suddenly<br>  Eddern lunged mightily, and smote Geraint<br>  So hard upon the temple that the steel<br>  Of his helm, sundering, a flake of steel<br>  Was riven away, and only the thin coiffe<br>  Protected the brain, and the descending sword<br>  Cleft wide the mail upon the prince's side<br>  More than a hand's breadth.  Giddily then Geraint<br>  Reeled from the blow, and Enid tried to speak<br>  But could not for the horror, and of the shout<br>  Of Lyconal, "O vengeance for the Queen!"<br>  Geraint heard not a word.  But while his ears<br>  Were filled with roarings, and above his eyes<br>  A darkness writhed, and all of life and love<br>  Seemed slipping, slipping from him, in one glimpse<br>  Narrowed by closing lids, upon his arm<br>  He saw the silken favour given of love,<br>  And all it meant to him flashed through his mind;<br>  And for one final effort he called to him<br>  The fullness of his strength, and raised his sword<br>  High, high above his head and with such force<br>  Smote on the other's helm that the sword crashed<br>  Through helm and coiffe of steel, through skin and flesh,<br>  And stayed not till it wounded even the bone--<br>  And as a dead man falls, fell Eddern to earth.<br>  <br>  Then while the knights and ladies gathered round<br>  With sighs and exclamations, Prince Geraint<br>  Unlaced his foeman's ventail, and the air<br>  Drew Eddern from his swooning.  And the prince<br>  Spake to Sir Lyconal, "My lord, behold<br>  Thy strong oppressor.  Shall he live or die?<br>  Unto thy will I give him."  And the earl,<br>  Long-looking on his brother's only son,<br>  Made answer: "I have thought if ever came<br>  The means to slay him, with rejoicing should<br>  I send him down to death.  Now it <i> is</i>  come,<br>  And lo, I can not.  For a ghost is here<br>  'Twixt me and my revengement.  Seeing him,<br>  Why must I see my brother?  Let him live,<br>  So he make reparation!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son of Nudd,<br>  Eddern," said Prince Geraint, "thy life is spared<br>  Upon thy promise to perform two things;<br>  Refuse, thou diest."  But the fallen man moaned,<br>  "Die?  Live or die?  What matter?--I am shamed!"<br>  "First, thou shalt render to Sir Lyconal,<br>  Thine uncle, what is his--all goods and gold,<br>  Lands and retainers.  On this very field<br>  Shalt thou thus reinstate him.  Then straight-way,<br>  With lady and with dwarf thou shalt ride forth<br>  To Arthur's hall, before Queen Guenevere<br>  To cast thyself, such full amends to make<br>  As she may adjudge fitting.  Marvel not!<br>  Dost thou forget how but two days agone,<br>  Beside the Wood of Dean, thou didst allow<br>  Thy dwarf to strike the damsel of the Queen,<br>  And through her, to insult the Queen herself?<br>  Dost thou forget the knight who also had<br>  A blow from thy slave's hand?  I am that knight,<br>  But with mine own revenge am I content.<br>  For that outrage thou goest to Geuenevere,<br>  Saying Geraint hath sent thee.  Yea or nay?"<br>  And Eddern, son of Nudd, in halting speech<br>  Replied, "So be it! These will I perform;<br>  Though why I hardly know, saving it be,<br>  To make my shame the greater, even while shamed,<br>  Life waxes sweet!"<br>  <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tottering he rose,<br>  The red mire clinging to his golden plumes,<br>  And swaying with the weakness of his hurt,<br>  Made proclamation that unto the earl,<br>  His uncle, he did render lands and goods--<br>  All whereof he had reaved him--and ordained<br>  That all his knights do homage to the earl<br>  And be his vassals true; and kneeling low,<br>  Within Sir Lyconal's hands he placed his own<br>  Limp, bloodless hands, and sware him fealty.<br>  Then called he for his horse and rode away,<br>  His dwarf in sullen silence at his side,<br>  His lady, much lamenting.  And he fared<br>  Unto Caerlleon, and the Queen was kind<br>  And pardoned him and healed him,--ay, did more;<br>  For seeing well that in him was a force<br>  Of manhood truly great, though evil life<br>  Had warped it to misusage, Guenevere,<br>  By ever-gentle tact and courtesy,<br>  And high ensample of fair chivalry,<br>  Won Eddern to a hatred of the old,<br>  Fierce lawlessness he once had revelled in;<br>  And though the task was difficult, and the way<br>  Fraught with discouragements, he grew at last<br>  Into a greater Eddern, no less brave<br>  And resolute than before, but loving truth<br>  And right and gentleness,--a man esteemed<br>  Both by his fellows of the Table Round,<br>  And by the King.  And Arthur stablished him<br>  As governor in the wild, northern land--<br>  A post full honourable and perilous--<br>  To guard those distant marches from the swarms<br>  Of pagans who looked longing from the wave.<br>  And what time in an after year the King<br>  Sailed over sea against the lord of Rome<br>  Lucius the Evil, in that mighty host<br>  Went Eddern, none more trusted of his Prince;<br>  And there, upon Cotentin's bloody field<br>  He fought, and fighting fell, and was no more.<br>  <br>   But for that night Sir Lyconal proclaimed<br>  Within his fortress a fair festival, <br>  The lordliest the land had ever seen.<br>  To this were all folk welcome, were they born<br>  In high or low estate--in gentle's hall<br>  Or peasant's cottage--all alike should share<br>  In one great merry-making which the earl<br>  Would hold to honour that young knight from whom<br>  He had his reinstatement.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it chanced<br>  In the slant sunshine of late afternoon,<br>  That Prince Geraint, to whose wounds, had been laid<br>  Soft salves and healing ointments, stood within<br>  The shadow of the battlements and watched<br>  The throngs of townsmen in the streets below<br>  At every corner gathered, and well guessed<br>  Their eager talk of what that day had seen.<br>  <br>  Thither to him came noble Lyconal,<br>  Attired in crimson, overwrought with gold.<br>  Bright was his face with happiness, and it seemed<br>  Full twenty years had from his shoulders slipped,<br>  So blithely straight, his carriage.  "My lord earl,"<br>  Said Prince Geraint, "it does content me well<br>  To see thee in thy properness of state.<br>  And Enid--where is she?"  Ere answering,<br>  Lyconal smiled, "She will array herself<br>  To do thee honour, prince."  Whereat Geraint<br>  Smiled also but said earnestly, "My lord,<br>  I pray thee ask will she first speak with me."<br>  Lyconal went with that request, and soon<br>  Came Enid, and upon her arm she bare<br>  The robe she wished to don,--a wondrous silk<br>  Of shaded blue, with such dense broidery<br>  Of tiny silver flowers it had the sheen<br>  Of moonlight on deep waters; and she showed<br>  The wonders of the dress, dwelling thereon<br>  With a shy pride and gladness.  But Geraint,<br>  With eyes for her face only, where the play<br>  Of rose upon the white and white on rose<br>  Wrought beauty ever new and marvelous,<br>  Took both her hands in his and spake to her:<br>  <br>  "Belov&eacute;d, wouldst thou think me rude, unkind,<br>  If I should say, 'Wear not this glittering gown,--<br>  Not to the feast thy father holds this eve,<br>  Neither to-morrow, going to Arthur's hall.<br>  Wear rather this, thy satiny robe of white,<br>  Though old it be, and worn?'  Nay, do not look<br>  So grieved, so woebegone.  Though I must seem<br>  Capricious, strangely-humoured, pleasure me,<br>  My Enid, in this matter.  I would have<br>  The Queen, and the Queen only, of her grace<br>  To clothe thee in arrayment sumptuous<br>  First on that day when I may call thee bride.<br>  Thou art my love, the Queen, a most true friend,<br>  As she will be thy friend on knowing thee:<br>  I trust ye twain will love each other well.<br>  To her hands would I take thee, by her hands<br>  To be attired full fairly.  And again,<br>  I love thee in this garb; more fair art thou<br>  To me in this white vest than didst thou wear<br>  A gown of woven gold.  In this I saw<br>  Thee first and knew I loved thee, and in this,<br>  Truly it seems to me thou hast a charm--<br>  Though what it is I find no words to tell--<br>  Thou couldst not have in a more stately robe.<br>  At court much must be different; but here,<br>  Seeing thee thus, all white and rose and gold,<br>  And thinking how I fould thee, how I heard<br>  Thee singing in the sunset's witchery,<br>  I sometimes think I have won not a maid<br>  Of mortal fairness and of mortal love,<br>  But a white fay from Faerie; for the fays,<br>  Like thee, have hair of gold, colour as bright<br>  And clearly delicate, lips red like thine,<br>  Voice of the same sweet music, and they wear <br>  White always, like to this.  My wish it is<br>  To keep thy faery whiteness while I may;<br>  Belov&eacute;d, wilt thou pleasure me in this way?"<br>  <br>  And willingly she put the gown away.<br>  And by the prince's side, at that great feast<br>  Sat, robed in ancient white, the hawk of gold<br>  Before her, and a light within her eyes:<br>  And all men said she was the fairest there.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> IV</b> <br>  <br>  When the next day lay bright upon the land,<br>  Toward undorne waxing, the farewells were said--<br>  Farewells, with smiles and tears.  And then Geraint<br>  Placed Enid on her palfrey, white as milk,<br>  Her father's parting gift; and so, while high<br>  Upon the parapets to watch them go<br>  Stood Lyconal and his wife, below them grouped<br>  The lords and ladies of the earl's household,<br>  Waving gay scarves in lingering farewell,<br>  They twain did ride away, and it was June,<br>  And all the world was bathed in molten gold<br>  Of June's young sunshine.  And with golden hair<br>  Netting the sunlight, with eyes luminous<br>  By reason of the brightness in her soul,<br>  In vest of white upon her milk-white steed,<br>  Unto her lover Enid was as one<br>  But lately come from Faerie,--far too fair<br>  For this old world.  And ever must he think<br>  In a sheer, humble wonder, "Lo, her eyes!<br>  Her smile, her smile!  These are the totaling<br>  Of all my life!  That these should be for me!"<br>  They went another way than that o'er which<br>  Geraint had followed Eddern when he came.<br>  Dividing the deep verdance of the hills,<br>  The road ran on, so hedged with the gay broom's<br>  Bright-blossoming gold, it might have been the path<br>  To some land of enchantment,--even that<br>  Which old romances say forever leads<br>  To the far Plain of Pleasure.  Larkspurs reared<br>  Their columned purple, wilding roses trailed<br>  Their pink blooms by the way.  Never the sky<br>  Had been of hue more wonderful--a dome<br>  Of pale, translucent sapphire, in whose vault<br>  Glittered those ice-white mansions which the clouds<br>  Do build for Summer's dwelling, many-towered<br>  And hundred-turreted, with argent, halled,<br>  With the sun's gold, emportaled.  And Geraint<br>  Remembered him of Launfal, and the fay,<br>  And how they rode to Faerie; and he said,<br>  "Like Launfal and his love in olden time,<br>  My Enid, do we ride to that far land<br>  Of every rainbow's ending?"  But her eyes<br>  Were grave, her smile half-wistful, and she said,<br>  "Triamour am I not, mine own Geraint."<br>  <br>  And they came to a meadow, where a stream--<br>  A rivulet a boy could step across--<br>  Glinted in fluent sunfire between banks<br>  Now darksome under drooping willow-boughs,<br>  Now with white daisies bordured, and the frail,<br>  Tremulous blue of harebells, swinging light<br>  Upon thread-slender stems.  The meadow-grass,<br>  Lush, feathery, sweet-scented, bowed beneath<br>  The pressure of the wind's invisible<br>  But audible wings--motion so rhythmical<br>  That all before the riders was a sea<br>  Of undulating green, save when, at times,<br>  Ghost-grey upon the greeness, glidingly<br>  Floated the shadows of the summer clouds.<br>  And so, through multiple play of light and shade<br>  Fared Enid and Geraint, and as they passed<br>  Across the meadow, somewhere in the blue<br>  Above, or in the emerald at their feet,<br>  A lark sang joyously.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the sun<br>  Burned in the zenith, and the slumberous noon<br>  Weighted the world, and a fine, aureate mist<br>  Of straightly-falling radiance, curtain-wise<br>  Hung between earth and sky, in its deep glow<br>  So veiled the land that all things were transformed<br>  To a strange, bright illusion, beautiful<br>  As that bright Isle of Summer which is seen<br>  Sometimes on phantom wave-line, rested they<br>  Beneath a mighty ash-tree, at the edge<br>  Of a great forest.  And of white and gold<br>  Was woven the flower-carpet of the wood,<br>  And white and gold was Enid; and Geraint,<br>  Watching the sifted sunlight in her hair,<br>  Dreamed of the Courts of Faerie, and he said,<br>  "O Princess of the Vale of Avalon,<br>  What splendor is upon thee?"  But her smile<br>  Was grave, and her eyes wistful, and she said,<br>  "Splendor of Avalon would it were, my lord!"<br>  <br>  And they rode forward through the forest-land.<br>  Often by stately avenues they passed<br>  To noble parks and spacious pleasaunces;<br>  And otherwhile, by paths of bending fern,<br>  Entered close, humid coverts, alder-screened<br>  To a perpetual twilight, where they saw<br>  Tall, white and graceful lilies, like young saints<br>  Sheltered in shadowed cloisters.  Thus they fared<br>  Until in lengthening shades the undertide<br>  Journeyed to even, and the west grew flame<br>  With the sun's setting, when, in a fair glade,<br>  The lovers checked their steeds, and with one thought,<br>  Wordless before the beauty, watched the sky<br>  Fade from its gorgeous purple and its rose,<br>  Through pinks and amethysts, with paling gleams<br>  Of opal lights, through pearls and lavenders,<br>  Into dove-grey and dully-brooding blue;<br>  While to the south, above dim barbacans<br>  Of vapors violet, one great star shone,<br>  A glimmer of red gold.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with the awe<br>  Of that wide loveliness possessing them,<br>  While all around the blossom-redolent dusk<br>  Spread its enchantments, and a throstle's song<br>  Was poured upon the evening in a flood<br>  Of music almost palpable, they came<br>  Unto a forest hermitage--a pile<br>  Of low, grey walls, laved by a mountain rill,<br>  And topped by ancient trees wherethrough the wind<br>  Breathed with insistent harmonies.  Therein<br>  They parted for the night, and in her heart<br>  Enid knew well, as knew Geraint in his,<br>  That never would a day of such delight<br>  Be theirs again,--never, for all their love--<br>  That never such a day could be again.<br>  <br>  When the next afternoon was but half-spent,<br>  Below them to the south, they saw the line<br>  Of vaporous blue which marked the Severn Sea;<br>  And nearer, in the green vale of the Usk's<br>  Broad, sinuous flood, white-shining in the sun,<br>  Beheld Caerlleon's heaven-yearning towers.<br>  <br>  Then they went forward gladly, and in haste,<br>  And heard a sound of harping.  In the wood<br>  Walked Alarin the harper, and a knight<br>  Was with him of the name of Honolan,<br>  Famed for his fine, fair hair; and by a strain<br>  Of blood, much thinned and weakened though it was,<br>  This Honolan was kinsman to Geraint.<br>  Yet closest kinsmanhood had never served<br>  To make him love Geraint; for envious<br>  He was of heart, and that King Arthur held<br>  The prince high in his favour, honouring him<br>  In measure to the knightliness he showed,<br>  Was ample reason for Sir Honolan<br>  To hate Geraint in secret, and to hope,<br>  Above all other hopes, to work him woe.<br>  And yet, until a time should come, he kept<br>  His malice so concealed, he was so smooth,<br>  So silken-soft of manner, free with smiles,<br>  And traitorly fine-spoken, that no one,<br>  Geraint the least of all, could dream him false.<br>  <br>  As these two loitered down the forest-path,<br>  Around a sudden turn, where the thick sward<br>  Muffled their coming, Enid and the prince<br>  Rode through a patch of sunlight.  And as one<br>  Bewitched, at the white beauty of the maid<br>  Alarin stared, and all thought of his song<br>  Fled from him, and unknowing what he did,<br>  He struck so roughly the taut music-strings<br>  That whirring shrill one snapped beneath his hand.<br>  Which, Honolan perceiving, smiled, and bowed<br>  To cover that too evil smile, and spake<br>  With all of joy and fervor to Geraint:<br>  "Welcome, my lord!  Thy coming gladdens me<br>  Past my poor powers of speech.  We have all heard<br>  The story of thy prowess, from the lips<br>  Of one who now is yolden, and retired,<br>  At the Queen's command, into a holy house<br>  Until his wounds be healed.  Hearing the tale,<br>  Who did rejoice as I,who am thy kin?<br>  But one desire had I, this hour fulfilled--<br>  To see thee in thy triumph, and to say<br>  Thy pride therein is not so great as mine.<br>  And that, when seeing thee, he sees also<br>  The fairest lady eyes have ever seen,<br>  Doubles the joy of thy friend, Honolan."<br>  <br>  To whom made answer gaily Prince Geraint:<br>  "Fair-spoken ever!  Knew I not thy heart,<br>  Good kinsman, I might think thy words too fair;<br>  But in my knowledging they ring with truth.<br>  Thy joy is timely, cousin.  I am blest<br>  Beyond all dream of blessing!  I am loved<br>  By Enid, daughter of Earl Lyconal."<br>  And while bowed Honolan, Geraint spake on<br>  To Alarin, who silent stood apart,<br>  "And thou, Sir Stitcher of the Threads of Song,<br>  Make me a song of bridals, for this night<br>  I wed the one rare maiden of the world!"<br>  Whereto with slow speech Alarin replied,<br>  "To sing at others' bridals, fair, my lord,<br>  I think will ever be my lot in life.<br>  Yet doubt not!  Thou shalt have a goodly song."<br>  <br>  Then they went onward to Caerlleon's gate,<br>  The four in company; and when the watch,<br>  Stationed upon the ramparts of the King,<br>  Beheld their near approach, the news was sent<br>  To Guenevere that Prince Geraint did come,<br>  And with him was a lady passing fair.<br>  And with a noble following, the Queen<br>  Went forth to meet and greet them, and with words<br>  Of gentleness and courtesy she gave<br>  To Enid welcome as a friend to be.<br>  <br>  And that day, for the wedding, Guenevere<br>  Clothed Enid in the garments of a bride,<br>  With gold and jewels upon her, and in her hair<br>  Jewels and gold.  Yet now though like the sun<br>  For beauty and for brightness, Enid prayed<br>  That her old, satin vest be not destroyed;<br>  For thinking how Geraint had held it dear,<br>  She would preserve it always.  And the Queen<br>  Smiled understandingly and had the gown<br>  Laid in a chest of cedar.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that night<br>  Before Saint Aaron's altar they were wed.<br>  And afterwards, in the great banquet-hall,<br>  At the gay bridal-feasting, Alarin,<br>  True to his promise, sang a goodly song,<br>  Which song he called Love's House, and it was this:<br>  <br>  "Lo, Love hath builded him a stately hall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof the ceiling's arch he fashioneth<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Of imagery so delicate a breath<br>  Might blur it all to discord; on the wall<br>  The ancient arras, pictured folds a-fall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;With voice of myriad lovers murmureth,<br>  Whose sighs and smiles are warp and woof withal.<br>  <br>  "And to irradiate that noble room,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;The lamp of Purity, with steadfast fire,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Forever shadowlessly burneth higher,<br>  Fed by sweet oil of Fair Thought, whose perfume<br>  Balmier is than orient amber-hume,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;More subtle than what fragrances suspire<br>  From moon-white flowers of Faerie full in bloom.<br>  <br>  "Lo, Love hath made for him an hallowed place,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Whereof the portal is of beauty rare;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;The door-trees are of Constancy, more fair,<br>  Finer than finest porphyry; a grace,<br>  Passing all earthly fulgence, from the face<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Of Truth is shed, from that high lintel, where<br>  He standeth, kingly crowned, with crystal mace.<br>  <br>  "And at the threshold, which is Sympathy,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Two staves of odorous sandal, opposite<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Each unto other, without light belit,<br>  Do bear two banners of bright blazonry,<br>  Vermeil and green, and in charactery<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Of gold, the vermeil hath upon it writ<br>  Time, but the green one hath Eternity.<br>  <br>  "Such is Love's temple.

We are come<br>  From thy true vassal, Erbin, King of Devon;<br>  He greets thee as his nephew and his lord,<br>  And asks thy hearkening to his word of need<br>  Which we declare.  The feebleness of age<br>  Is on the king, and knowing this, the chiefs<br>  Whose lands do neighbor his are insolent<br>  And covetous grown, and with impunity<br>  Harass his borders, and lay waste his towns,<br>  And ever set their boundaries farther forth.<br>  Erbin is old, and who hath dread of him?<br>  But Prince Geraint, his son, is strong with youth,<br>  A mighty warrior whose wide fame is flown<br>  Over the face of the kingdom.  Wherefore, Sire,<br>  Permit the son of Erbin to return<br>  Into his father's realm, that so may be<br>  Back-driven the fierce aggressor, the desire<br>  Of the covetous, plucked from him, and restored<br>  The boundaries of the kingdom.  This, the prayer<br>  Which Erbin sends thee in his hour of need."<br>  <br>  To which said Arthur: "And the prayer is just.<br>  And though, for mine own sake, I would have wished<br>  The word to come for some less glorious knight<br>  Than Prince Geraint, whose valiance hath no peer,<br>  The justice of the plea none can deny.<br>  Go ye, take food and wine, refresh yourselves<br>  Of your fatigues, and this same day return,<br>  And Prince Geraint shall follow you to-morn."<br>  Joyfully the ambassadors retired.<br>  <br>  Then summoning the prince, King Arthur told<br>  The message sent from Devon; and Geraint;<br>  Although regretful that he must forego<br>  The noble fellowship of that fair court,<br>  And, before all, the daily intimacy<br>  And close communion with the King he loved,<br>  Looked to his duty and his father's wrongs,<br>  And cheerfully made provision to depart.<br>  And the next morning at the hour of prime,<br>  While the court cried farewells, and Geuenevere<br>  Made sorrow for the going of the friend<br>  Whom best she loved, forth from Caerlleon's gates<br>  Rode Prince Geraint and Enid, and with them,<br>  A gallant retinue of five score knights;<br>  Among them such as Sir Bedvere the Brave,<br>  Who, in an after year, beyond the sea<br>  Fighting for Arthur through the lines of Rome,<br>  At Bayonne found a tomb; and Peredur,<br>  The seventh son of Evrawc of the North,<br>  A breaker of enchantments; bold Sir Howel,<br>  Kinsman of Arthur, unto whom was given<br>  Lordship in Brittany; that noble knight,<br>  The greatest of the sons of Pellinore,<br>  Sir Lamorak de Galis, to be slain<br>  By Gawain's evil brethren traitorly;<br>  And, of a semblant frank and debonair,<br>  Hiding an envious treason in his heart<br>  Which yet had found no outlet, Honolan.<br>  <br>  Never a fairer host was seen to pass<br>  Over the Severn, journeying towards the south.<br>  Two days they traveled over hills and slopes,<br>  Through forests and wide laundes, by shining streams,<br>  And on the third day, in the blaze of noon,<br>  Rode into Carnant, walled and towered and spired,<br>  King Erbin's capital city, where he lay<br>  In a strong fortress till his son should come.<br>  Then were bells rung in gladness and the folk<br>  Shouted and wept for joy, and crowded close<br>  To touch the housings of Geraint's destrier,<br>  Crying that their own prince was come again.<br>  And through streets hung with tapestries and scarves<br>  Of coloured silks, and banners of the king,<br>  And strown with reeds and mint and iris-flower,<br>  Geraint and Enid with their train of knights<br>  Passed to the fortress, where King Erbin gave<br>  To all a royal welcome, to his son<br>  Honours and blessings, and to that son's wife,<br>  Whom then first he beheld, a father's love,<br>  Not only for her peerlessness of charm,<br>  But for her noble clarity of soul;<br>  And ever he loved her as his own fair child,<br>  And ever in her he had exceeding pride.<br>  <br>  Then upon Erbin's foes Geraint made war,<br>  Swift and retributive, and vanquished them,<br>  Back-drove the fierce aggressor, the desire<br>  Of the covetous plucked from him, and restored<br>  The boundaries of the kingdom.  And with peace<br>  Came order and prosperity where had been<br>  Confusion and disaster, and the realm<br>  Felt the protection of the governing hand,<br>  And knew the kingly blood was warm again.<br>  And Erbin, of the great pride which he had<br>  In his son's warriorhood, transferred to him<br>  Daily such added power that he became<br>  Virtually, if not in name, the king,<br>  And vassals from far corners of the land<br>  Journeyed to do him homage as their lord.<br>  And like a generous man, Geraint enriched<br>  His friends, his nobles, and his gathering court<br>  With jewels and arms and steeds from Araby,<br>  And won a name for largesse, and renown<br>  As a most princely knight and knightly prince.<br>  And he let cry great tournaments, wherein<br>  He battled as the least conspicuous knight,<br>  And often masked his shield, that he might have<br>  No vantage from his name or from his fame,<br>  And all who came against him overbare;<br>  And when, at each day's closing, pursuivants<br>  Would bid the disguised champion unhelm,<br>  That so the victor of the field be known,<br>  Behold, it was Geraint!  Thus, while his friends<br>  Rejoiced in his unfaltering force and skill,<br>  And Enid gloried in her matchless knight,<br>  And Arthur, in his palace to the north,<br>  Heard, and was gladdened by the noble tale,<br>  The prince's fame increased, until at last,<br>  In all the Devon-realm remained no man<br>  Who dared oppose the arm of such renown.<br>  And then a change grew over Prince Geraint.<br>  <br>  For as the mantle of the months was spread<br>  In riper, tawnier colours, and the grass<br>  At every roadside whitened with the fire<br>  And wasting weight of summer, in his halls<br>  Geraint began to linger easefully,<br>  For a time seeking minstrelsy and games;<br>  And found a pleasure in the tumblers' skill,<br>  Their leapings and their twistings, in the tilts<br>  At chess and tric-trac, and a new delight<br>  In the melodious languour of the viol,<br>  And psaltery and cithern, harp and rote,<br>  To which, in lowered voices, minstrels sang<br>  The lays of lovers of the long ago.<br>  And afterwards, resurgent, with each day<br>  More mighty, in his soul so strong a tide<br>  Of love for his fair wife began to rise<br>  That all his life was compassed by that love,<br>  And merged and utterly resolved in love--<br>  With Enid only, knew he any joy,<br>  To Enid only, did he give a thought,<br>  And all his hours he spent with her alone.<br>  And for the sake of her companionship,<br>  His harpers and his tumblers and his games<br>  He heard and saw no more; the noble sport<br>  Of hunting, and the knightly exercise<br>  Of joust and tournament he did forgo;<br>  And for his nobles' good will had no care,<br>  Forsook his princely duties, and turned away<br>  The hearts of all the host of all his court.<br>  <br>  Wherefore, while over-fast the summer aged<br>  To autumn's pathos of impermanence,<br>  While in the fretful winds of afternoon,<br>  Recurrently, a crescent minor wailed<br>  And died away and swelled and wailed again,<br>  Beginning to intone the time-old dirge<br>  For all the beauty that ere long must die,<br>  Like to the wind, but with more rapid wing,<br>  A rumor breathed across King Erbin's realm,<br>  At first the merest whisper, of which none<br>  Could tell the origin, save Honolan;<br>  But passed from ear to ear, from tongue to tongue,<br>  Gathering to more than whisper, at the last<br>  Blew with such violence that every churl<br>  On Erbin's farthest marches knew the tale,--<br>  How Prince Geraint had turned him recreant,<br>  How all his glorious force had fallen from him,<br>  How, from excessive love for his fair wife,<br>  The Prince of Many Battles had declined<br>  Into a silken lingerer in a bower,<br>  Sunk in a shameful lethargy, and content.<br>  And in unlowered voices, men began<br>  To jeer and scoff at him, to make his name<br>  A jest and soon a hissing, and to cry<br>  Out against Enid as the cause of all.<br>  And Arthur, in his palace to the north,<br>  Heard, and lamented for his peerless knight;<br>  And Erbin heard and sorrowed for his son;<br>  And Enid heard and saddened for her lord,<br>  Tormented by unreasoning self-reproach;<br>  But Prince Geraint heard nothing, lost in love.<br>  <br>  And Erbin said to Enid on a day,<br>  "It is not thy will, daughter, that our prince<br>  Forsake his name and fame for love of thee?"<br>  "Nay, sire," said Enid, sadly, "I do swear<br>  Nothing more hateful is to me than this."<br>  "Upon thee, then, my daughter, does it rest<br>  To tell the prince what people say of him,<br>  And rouse him to his knighthood once again.<br>  From thy lips will he hear it gentliest."<br>  And Enid bowed her head in mute assent.<br>  And with each dawn that followed, she resolved<br>  To tell Geraint all ere the night should come;<br>  But such a dread she had of paining him,<br>  And such a delicacy of saying aught<br>  That would mean disapproval or dispraise,<br>  That each night fell to find all still untold.<br>  But what with the great love she had for him,<br>  And her great dolour for his lost renown,<br>  What with the anguish of her self-reproach,<br>  And the continual conflict with herself,<br>  The brightness of the colour in her cheek<br>  Faded to pallor, and the shining light<br>  Of joy passed from her face, and to her eyes<br>  A shadow came, darkening day by day.<br>  <br>  This change, so causeless seeming, Prince Geraint<br>  Perceived, and at it wondered, much distressed.<br>  Yet thinking that perchance some proof of love<br>  Had been by him omitted, which, though slight,<br>  Might be dear to a woman, he took pains<br>  To be still more the lover, to devise<br>  A hundred new ways to insure her joy;<br>  But maugre all his care--nay, as he thought,<br>  The more for all his care--he saw his wife<br>  Sadden and whiten with each added day.<br>  <br>  At last one undertide, when the long beams<br>  Of sunlight, slanting through the pallid gold<br>  Of leaves just touched with autumn, on the floor<br>  Of Enid's bower a patterned shadow cast<br>  Through the tall, painted casement, as they sat<br>  And watched the shifting of the coloured glow,<br>  And she was pale and quiet, speaking not,<br>  He rose and came to her, and took the face<br>  He loved between his hands, and said to her:<br>  "So sad, so pale, my Enid!  Why so sad?<br>  Thou knowest how well I love thee.  Enid--thou--<br>  Dost thou not love me, Enid, any more?"<br>  To which she answered, "Yea, so very well!"<br>  Yet drew away, and could not look at him,<br>  For in her heart she thought: "<i> Do</i>  I love well?<br>  If I loved well would I not have the strength<br>  To tell him what the people say of him,<br>  Even, though doing so, I wounded sore?<br>  True love is strong; my love is weak, weak, weak!<br>  I fear my love is not as true love is!"<br>  For this, her eyes were downcast, and her face<br>  Avert, her manner conscious and constrained.<br>  But to Geraint, who could not understand,<br>  There came an apprehension undefined,<br>  A sharp and sudden pang of formless dread;<br>  And with her words he was unsatisfied.<br>  And half in sorrow, half in wrath, he turned<br>  And left the bower, and while the palace-folk<br>  Gave silent place before him and exchanged<br>  Curious glances at his gloomy brow,<br>  He passed to a fair pleasuance, cool and green,<br>  Hedged in with hawthorns and with beeches white;<br>  And there, upon the velvet of the turf,<br>  In a fierce restlessness paced to and fro.<br>  <br>  Thither came Honolan, most curious<br>  Of all the curious watchers in the hall.<br>  "My lord," he said, "I know not if I come<br>  Welcome or most unwelcome, but I saw<br>  The pain upon thy countenance and feared<br>  Some heavy evil had befallen thee;<br>  And having thy well-being at my heart<br>  Always, I thought to learn what woe is thine."<br>  To which Geraint made answer with a groan<br>  Only, saying no word; but unabashed,<br>  Sir Honolan continued: "Nay, my prince,<br>  Why keep thy grief from me?  Less hardly borne<br>  Is sorrow that is shared with some true friend.<br>  And am I not of kindred soul with thee<br>  Even as of one blood?  Shall kindred hopes<br>  And dreams not make me worthy of thy trust?"<br>  "I fain would think so," answered Prince Geraint;<br>  "Yea, I do think so, friend.  But even to thee<br>  I am not certain should I speak of this--<br>  And yet, why not?  I am half-mad with doubts,<br>  Questions which have no answers.  What hath chanced<br>  To make my wife so changed--so wan of hue,<br>  So saddened of demeaour?  More than life,<br>  Than all life gives, I love her, as God knows!<br>  And in all ways have sought to prove my love!<br>  Why do I hear her sighing in the day?<br>  Why have I heard her weeping in the night?<br>  What reason can there be for such a change?"<br>  Then smiled Sir Honolan, and in the smile<br>  Was that at which Geraint cried suddenly,<br>  "Thou knowest the reason!  Speak!  What dost thou know?"<br>  But with a feigned disquiet, Honolan,<br>  Stammering, said, "My lord, command me not!<br>  I do but hazard guesses--wide, perchance.<br>  I pray thee ask me nothing."  But Geraint<br>  In one great fear returned, "What knowest thou?"<br>  "Nothing I know," said Honolan, "but this--<br>  If I must speak--this any one would think:<br>  When ladies weep, whose lords are by their side,<br>  Whose lords, unwavering in tender care,<br>  Do set their every hope to pleasing them,<br>  To gratifying each small wish unnamed--<br>  In such fair circumstance when ladies weep,<br>  Perchance--I only say perchance, my lord,--<br>  They then beweep one absent."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Geraint<br>  Stopped in his restless motion like a man<br>  Who, in the rout of battle, feels the quarrel<br>  Drive to the heart and turn him into stone.<br>  And it came to him he should slay this man,<br>  Like any unclean thing that drags its slime<br>  Across the good, the bright, the beautiful;<br>  And to his shame he knew he could not slay,<br>  For both his arms were nerveless and unpowered,<br>  His will, no stronger than a broken reed;<br>  And well he realized that this was due<br>  Not to the words in their self-singleness,<br>  But to the fact they closed so perfectly<br>  With that fierce, formless doubt, which, having had<br>  No import and no object, now had both.<br>  <br>  "Thou meanest then--" and like a weight the pain<br>  Dragged at his speech--"What meaning, Honolan?<br>  Stay, tell me not!  I know too well, too well!<br>  And though because thy lips could form those words,<br>  I think I should have slain thee with my hands,<br>  I must learn more.  Who is the man she loves?<br>  Can thy guess cover him?"<br>   <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mayhap not, lord;<br>  But I can name thee one who sighs for her,<br>  As I dare swear,--one who in Arthur's court<br>  Is called the favorite minstrel, Alarin<br>  The Faery-son.  Hear while I tell thee that<br>  To which mine eyes were witness.  Dost recall<br>  How, when returning from the very quest<br>  Which gave thee thy fair lady, in the wood<br>  Beyond Caerlleon, Alarin and I<br>  Met you two coming?  Well I call to mind<br>  Thy joy in love and in thy joy mine own!--<br>  Three years agone, three years!  But I delay:<br>  When 'round the sudden turn of the wood-path,<br>  Ye twain came riding through the sunlit glade,<br>  At that first sight of thy sweet lady's face,<br>  How tense and hueless did our minstrel grow,<br>  Like one who hath a vision in his soul!<br>  How he did stare and stare!  How pluck the strings<br>  Of his forgotten harp until one brake,<br>  Whirring, beneath his hand!  What look was his!--<br>  Oh, never men look so save they do love!<br>  All this, my prince, saw I to my great grief.<br>  Ay, and the song he sang that very night<br>  When ye were wed!  He had sung otherwise<br>  Before <i> my</i>  bridal-board, I warrant thee!<br>  But thou, my lord, so deep in thy new love--<br>  How couldst thou see the double meaning in it?--<br>  Love's House, built unto him, not unto thee!"<br>  <br>  But all the while a passion of remorse<br>  Tortured Geraint; the words that fell so fast<br>  And glibly evil from the other's tongue,<br>  The very name of him toward whom had leaped<br>  His jealousy's first impulse--though he heard,<br>  He heard them as far sounds that matter not,<br>  So dwarfed their brief significance was made<br>  By his own sense of overwhelming shame,<br>  In listening to what was surely false,<br>  In hearkening to a slander on his wife.<br>  And desperately he answered, like a man<br>  Who would convince himself before all men:<br>  "It can not be!  She is too good, too fair,<br>  Too gentle to be touched by any sin!<br>  Mire could not cling to her white purity!<br>  We wrong her, I and thou, by dreaming it.<br>  But mine is the immeasurable shame--<br>  I am her husband and her lover too--<br>  I never should have hearkened to a tale<br>  Wherein truth can not be!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, even so,"<br>  Said Honolan, "I have not called it truth;<br>  I were as grieved as thou to have it proved.<br>  My love for thee, and thine insistence, lord,<br>  Only, urged me to speak and tell thee that<br>  Which at the least is certain--he loves her;<br>  That she loves him I make no certainty,<br>  And fain were I to think it most untrue.<br>  But this I know, as thou must also know,<br>  That three years work a change in many a dame,<br>  And harp-skilled fingers and a tuneful voice<br>  And words of faery melody have power<br>  To bring the marriage-vow to pliancy;<br>  And singing she loves always, as all know.<br>  How often he sang to her!  I have marked<br>  At the great festivals how, when he sang,<br>  He might have been alone with her, so plain<br>  It was the song was meant for her alone!<br>  But thou, my lord, saw'st nothing, being in love."<br>   <br>  And when Geraint said no word in reply,<br>  Gazing in moody silence at the ground,<br>  Sir Honolan went on, his voice more low,<br>  More soft, and with a covert malice in it:<br>  "And after all, my prince, what is this sin?<br>  Hath it not grown so common in these years<br>  It scarce is held a sin now any more?<br>  There is most noble precedent, my lord.<br>  What of the wife of Sir Segwarides,<br>  That good Earl of the South?  And what of her,<br>  Our Arthur's sister, wife to Uriens<br>  Of Gore, Queen Morgan, loved by Accolon,<br>  And by how many others since his time?<br>  And Mark of Cornwall--can his kinglihood<br>  Avail to keep Isoud from Tristram's arms?<br>  And if we closelier come upon the throne,<br>  What do men say of Guenevere the Queen,<br>  Whose friendship thou didst suffer for thy wife--<br>  Nay, didst encourage, lord?  She, too, is fair,<br>  And once, I trow, was leal; yet every child<br>  That prattles of the great ones of the land<br>  Links Guenevere with Lancelot!  And last,<br>  Is there no shadow on the throne itself?<br>  What of that tale of Arthur's earlier days,<br>  Whereof the wise man said a curse was born<br>  To blast the realm with ruin to an end?--<br>  Of Arthur and the lady with four sons,<br>  To whom a fifth--"<br>   <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" cried Prince Geraint,<br>  "Say no more, Honolan!  Too much is said<br>  Already, and by far!  I know the tale,<br>  Know all the tales thou tellest!--what <i> of</i>  them?<br>  Do they degrade my Enid to their fen?<br>  Rather do they exalt her to the sun,<br>  Her light of purity do magnify!<br>  My doubt is done, my manlessness is gone;<br>  I swear she is as stainless and as true<br>  As when I found her in her father's hall,<br>  A maiden with her soul bright in her eyes.<br>  I will believe no falsity in her<br>  Until her own sweet lips proclaim it so!<br>  And had I the most faint distrust of thee,<br>  Did I suspect that thou wouldst spread this lie,<br>  Wouldst breathe a word of it to any one,<br>  I promise I should slay thee--yea, and should<br>  Though brotherhood stood in our cousinship!<br>  I trust thee; give thou me no cause for doubt!"<br>   <br>  And in a storm of self-wrath Prince Geraint<br>  Strode from the pleasaunce back to Enid's bower;<br>  And found her there as he had left her--still<br>  And pale and very silent--yet so fair,<br>  Of such unequalled purity of line,<br>  That looking at the beautiful, white brow,<br>  Sorely he blamed him for his lack of faith,<br>  And in remorseful tenderness took oath<br>  That never would he doubt her any more.<br>  But that same night, as Honolan had known,<br>  The dread incertitude would rise again<br>  Despite the strongest setting of his will;<br>  And all the vague suspicions and the fears<br>  And questions he could not explain aside<br>  Returned to his tormenting, and he lay<br>  With neither sleep nor peace the long night through,<br>  And not until the dawning slept at last.<br>  <br>  But as the morning mounted in the east,<br>  The ripe autumnal sunshine, amber-hued,<br>  Streamed through the windows, rich with imagery,<br>  Full on the couch of Enid and Geraint.<br>  And Enid woke and saw the counterpane<br>  Had slipped from off the prince's breast and arms,<br>  And bending over him, while still he slept,<br>  She gazed upon the sinewed brawn of breast<br>  And on the mighty muscles of his arms,<br>  Exulting in the grandeur of his mould.<br>  And then she seemed to hear the busy tongues<br>  Calling him recreant, in endless tales<br>  Of his unknightly lethargy and sloth;<br>  And all the gladness died within her heart,<br>  And all at once she wept and lowly said:<br>  <br>  "How like a noble weapon is my lord!<br>  Like some rare glaive of finest-tempered steel,<br>  Which often in the fray hath tried its edge,<br>  And never brake nor turned nor showed a flaw!--<br>  Yet now in idleness is rust-consumed!<br>  Ah, God forgive me!  Am I not the rust<br>  That hath consumed the valiance of my lord?--<br>  That makes him think no more of plunging steeds,<br>  Hauberk and plum&eacute;d helm, and blazoned shield,<br>  Driving of spear, sword-clanging, clapping hands,<br>  And gree of tourney, and all the glory of it?<br>  Through love of me is my great prince unmanned,<br>  Shorn of his honour, from his height is fallen,<br>  And given for a prey to evil tongues.<br>  The people call him recreant, but I--<br>  I am the recreant!  To me is due<br>  The blame, the shame for loss of his renown!<br>  And having wrought this treason, do I speak<br>  To rouse him to his knightlihood again?<br>  To tell him how in every laggard's talk<br>  His hand is grown too weak to hold the sword,<br>  His valour, thinned to craven apathy?<br>  To remedy my treason, do I speak?--<br>  Ay me!  Ay me!  Thus am I false indeed!"<br>  <br>  And by a most unhappy circumstance,<br>  Her tears fell on his breast, and he awoke<br>  And found her weeping, and her last sad words<br>  Rang in his ears, "Thus am I false indeed!"<br>  And all the evil speech of Honolan,<br>  And all his own suspicions and his fears<br>  Boiled upward in his mind and seemed confirmed.<br>  And power to reason that if she <i> were</i>  false,<br>  She had not so confessed it, he had none;<br>  But like one mad he flung him from the couch<br>  And stared at her, and like a madman cried,<br>  "So, from thy very lips I learn a truth<br>  I might have learned from others, had I thought<br>  To put a credence in it!"  Then he turned<br>  And shouted to his squire, "Be quick!  My horse,<br>  My arms, my lady's palfrey--ready them<br>  With all the haste thou canst!"  And to his wife<br>  He spake with harsh command: "Do thou arise,<br>  Array thee, for we go adventuring!--<br>  What matter whither, so that we be gone?<br>  So that I take thee far from courts and halls?<br>  For I will root these fancies from thy heart,<br>  And drive these wishful memories from thy soul,<br>  And I will have thee with me till I die!"<br>  And then a devil seemed to rise in him,<br>  Prompting his words, for with a bitter smile<br>  He added, "And if on this quest I die,<br>  What grief to thee?  Easier then to seek<br>  The company of him for whom thou weepest!"<br>  But Enid, though in sorrowful amaze<br>  Stung by the taunt she could not understand,<br>  Met his gaze steadily: "My lord Geraint,<br>  Thy meaning is a hidden thing to me."<br>  And though he would have answered, "Search thy heart<br>  For meaning!"  the clear look within her eyes<br>  Stayed his reproach, for in his soul he knew<br>  Never a guilty woman could look so.<br>  And fain would he have taken her in his arms,<br>  And all their misery had ended then;<br>  But such a storm of wrath and pride and shame<br>  Possessed him that he could not, and he cried:<br>  "I said, array thee!  Do I speak in vain?<br>  Array thee in thy poorest, oldest gown,--<br>  Ay, even the satin one I saw thee wear<br>  When first I found thee in the ancient hall.<br>  Three years thou hast not worn it.  Don it now,<br>  And come with me!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mutely Enid went<br>  And took the worn robe from the cedrine chest,<br>  And shook the flowers-of-balsam from the folds,<br>  And put it on, and the squire armed Geraint.<br>  Then silent each to other, they went forth<br>  Into the castle-courtyard, filled with folk<br>  Wondering at the story which was rife.<br>  And much of marvel at the prince's arms,<br>  At Enid's strange, worn raiment, at the dole<br>  On either's face, the knights and ladies made;<br>  But to Geraint none dared to say a word--<br>  Not even Honolan--so black he looked.<br>  But thither came King Erbin, and he said<br>  Full sorrowfully, "My son, what doest thou?<br>  Wilt thou ride forth with neither knight nor squire?<br>  Beyond our borders is a perilous land;<br>  Wilt thou endanger Enid and thyself?<br>  For thy wife's sake go not unretinued!"<br>  But Geraint answered, "Sire, it is my will.<br>  I pray thee do not seek to alter it."<br>  And with no further word, he set his wife<br>  Upon her dappled palfrey, he himself<br>  Mounted his bay destrier of Gascon breed,<br>  And from the palace-gates they went the way<br>  Which led to the great wilderness of the west.<br>  And Geraint said to Enid: "Do thou ride<br>  Before me always by a furlong's half,<br>  And whatsoever thou mayest see or hear,<br>  Saving I speak to thee, speak not to me!"<br>  And sadly she rode on as she was bid.<br>  <br>  And in such wise did they depart from home;<br>  And all that from the courtyard watched them go<br>  Had but one thought, "They go unto their death!"<br>  <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> II</b> <br>  <br>  The noon had passed, and a grey bank of cloud,<br>  Rapidly mounting from the hazy south,<br>  Slipped o'er the westering sun, and spread beyond<br>  Till all the heaven was mantled in dull grey,<br>  And all the landscape darkened.  And a wind,<br>  Uprising, momently increased in force,<br>  And with a low, wild wailing swept across<br>  The waste wherethrough rode Enid and Geraint.<br>  For Erbin's marches they had left behind,<br>  Long since the mellow harvest-fields had passed,<br>  The orchards, red and golden with ripe fruit,<br>  And all the peace and plenty of that fair realm;<br>  And now they rode in one vast, dreary plain,<br>  Where evenly on all sides the leaden sky<br>  Came down to the flat launde, with never break<br>  Of hill nor tree on which the eye could rest;<br>  Where nothing throve save thorny clumps of gorse,<br>  And sweeps of heather powdered grey with dust;<br>  Where not a sound there was but of the wind,<br>  Crying of desolations and of death.<br>  And unto Enid, riding far before,<br>  Half-sick with loneliness and wounded love,<br>  The grey monotony of earth and sky<br>  And the funereal music of the wind<br>  Became as an oppression, and grew and grew<br>  To horror definite, until at last<br>  Hardly could she refrain from riding back<br>  And crying to Geraint that they were doomed--<br>  That they were caught between this sky and plain,<br>  That they must ride forever upon this waste,<br>  Forever see the angry heaven lower<br>  Evenly to the launde, forever hear<br>  The wailing, the unearthly threne of wind!--<br>  But she rode on with neither cry nor word.<br>  <br>  But deaf to wind, and blind to earth and sky,<br>  Conscious alone of memories that rent<br>  His mind with living torture, rode Geraint.<br>  Ever his thoughts went wandering to the past,--<br>  A ruined hall, a ruddy sunset glow,<br>  A song down-floating through the violet dusk,<br>  A maiden of the fairness of a fay!<br>  And he had sworn to love the maiden well,<br>  To care for her as no man else could care,<br>  However worthier!  He had invoked<br>  A punishment from Heaven should he fail<br>  But once in his great love's true tenderness!--<br>  Then would he look where Enid rode before,<br>  And in remorseful anguish groan aloud.<br>  Another picture: ivy, and the white,<br>  Closed blooms of honeysuckles, and the dawn<br>  Shining in misty silver on a court<br>  Changed by Love's miracle into a shrine!<br>  And he, with soul exalted, had taken vow,<br>  By conduct ever nobler, knightlier,<br>  To prove Love's grace was not too ill bestowed,<br>  To prove, so far as any might deserve<br>  Such grace, he would deserve it by his life!<br>  Then did he <i> know</i>  that Honolan had lied!--<br>  But why, but why, "Thus am I false indeed"?<br>  And not as knight-at arms would think to ride,<br>  With head bowed on his breast, with body limp,<br>  Sunk forward in the saddle, rode Geraint<br>  Through unrecked hours of waste and grieving wind.<br>  <br>  At last, above the launde, Enid beheld<br>  The far-off swaying of a shadowy line,<br>  And nearer saw a tangled coppice-wood.<br>  And gladly did her eyes rest on this break<br>  In the flatness of the plain, and she rode on,<br>  Watching the young trees bend before the wind.<br>  <br>  Then she was ware that three armed horsemen lurked<br>  Close in the thicket shadow, and as she drew<br>  Nearer, the leader boasted to his men:<br>  "Behold, two horses and armour and a girl<br>  Come to us for the taking!  Yonder knight--<br>  What man of spirit is he, that he hangs<br>  His head so heavily and rides behind?<br>  Easy to vanquish him first, and mine the right<br>  To attack him first, seeing I saw him first."<br>  <br>  And Enid heard and on her fell great fear.<br>  And she looked back and saw how Prince Geraint<br>  Did ride indeed with head sunk on his breast,<br>  Seeing and hearing nothing; and she thought,<br>  "He will be slain for he is off his guard!<br>  Before he can couch lance he will be slain!<br>  And yet he has forbidden me to speak!<br>  But herein is no silence; I <i> must</i>  speak!"<br>  <br>  And swiftly she rode back and spake to him:<br>  "My lord, three horsemen wait in yonder copse,<br>  And I have heard them plan thine overthrow."<br>  Then wrath with her it was not, but self-wrath<br>  Which made of her its victim, that caused Geraint<br>  To answer irritably, "Did I command<br>  Thy warning or thy silence?  Did I say<br>  Speak, or speak not, saving I speak to thee?<br>  But ride apart, for yonder comes the first."<br>  Hardly had Enid ridden to one side,<br>  When, with lance couched, upon spur-maddened steed,<br>  The bandit leader rushed upon Geraint.<br>  But while against the prince's shield, his lance<br>  Shivered, Geraint's brake not, but with such force<br>  Struck on the center of the other's shield,<br>  That wood and leather--ay, and mail beneath--<br>  Alike were riven, and to a cubit's length<br>  The spear passed through the body, and when withdrawn,<br>  Down from his plunging horse the foeman fell<br>  And in a rush of blood his life outflowed.<br>  Whereat the other horsemen both at once<br>  Couched lances and bare down upon Geraint.<br>  And at the golden eagles aimed the first,<br>  But his arm wavering, the lance went wide,<br>  And ere could he recover, such a blow<br>  Geraint dealt on his helm that in a swoon<br>  To earth he hurtled and lay as he were dead.<br>  And fearful lest the fate of his two friends<br>  Be also his, the third knight turned and fled<br>  For shelter towards the coppice, but Geraint,<br>  Pursuing, overtook him, and on the shield<br>  Struck him so mightfully that from his horse<br>  The bandit fell and lay a moment stunned,<br>  Then rose and fled on foot, at which the prince,<br>  Scorning to follow, suffered him to escape.<br>  But the three horses of his vanquished foes<br>  Geraint bound all together by their reins,<br>  And gave the reins to Enid, saying to her,<br>  "Ride onward now and drive these steeds before;<br>  And say no word, but if I speak to thee!"<br>  And forward through the plain she drove the three;<br>  And one was black, and one was white, and one<br>  Was dapple-grey.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed the coppice-wood,<br>  Journeying towards the swaying, shadowy line.<br>  And slowly into dusk the sad day waned,<br>  And tightlier seemed the ominous sky to close<br>  Down on the barren moors, and with the voice<br>  Of all the souls in Annwyn cried the wind.<br>  At length to Enid, straining through the gloom,<br>  The line mysterious resolved itself<br>  Into a forest of such vast extent<br>  That neither end nor boundary could she see<br>  Save on the side before her, and the trees<br>  Loomed darkling to the heavens, and in the wind<br>  She saw the mighty branches twist and writhe<br>  Like limbs of tortured giants, and they seemed<br>  To her the symbols of a woe to come.<br>  <br>  Then was she ware that five horsemen rode<br>  Forth from the deeper shadows, and men of might<br>  She saw they were, stalwart and huge of frame,<br>  Mounted on powerful chargers, and every man<br>  Had shield in place and spear in battle-rest.<br>  And nearer drawing, Enid hear one say:<br>  "Behold, at last a booty!  Five good steeds,<br>  And better yet, a lady!  And no one<br>  To guard them but yon craven of a knight,<br>  Who, weaker than his woman, slinks behind!--<br>  Sir Dolourous, whom any boy could slay!"<br>  To which another made a loud reply,<br>  "The lady we hold in common, but the knight--<br>  His life, his horse, his armour--shall be mine!<br>  Wherefore I make requiring of you all,<br>  That I be given the first encounter with him."<br>  <br>  Fearful indeed was Enid, hearing them.<br>  And through the gloom she looked back to Geraint,<br>  And saw him bent above the saddle-bow,<br>  Seeing and hearing nothing; and she thought,<br>  "Surely will he be slain before mine eyes!<br>  For he is wearied by the former fray,<br>  And now, while off his guard, these five will come<br>  Against him all defenseless!  Not to speak<br>  Is but to join the five in slaying him!"<br>  Then swiftly back along the bridle-path,<br>  She drove the snorting horses, and she cried<br>  In voice made shrill by fear, "My lord, yon knights<br>  Purpose thy death; I heard them plotting it.<br>  And they are five and thou art only one!"<br>  <br>  But angrily and bitterly Geraint<br>  Smiled on her misery: "And once again<br>  My wishes go unheeded!  I declare<br>  To Heaven that their purpose grieves me less<br>  Than thy continual disobedience.<br>  But ride apart: I battle with the first."<br>  <br>  Then down upon the prince the first knight spurred;<br>  But never had Geraint's hand been more firm,<br>  His aim more sure and steady!  Swift and hard<br>  He smote the other's shield, that 'neath the blow<br>  It crumpled like old parchment, the lance flew<br>  Far from his foeman's grasp, his stirrups brake,<br>  Wounded and senseless was he dashed to earth.<br>  The second came, and furiously Geraint<br>  Thrust the long spear-head through the ring&eacute;d mail<br>  Into his enemy's neck, that the sharp blade<br>  Protruded at the back, and when wrenched forth,<br>  Two spouting blood-streams washed the life away.<br>  Then setting spurs to his own horse, the prince,<br>  With thunder-sound of onset, met the third,<br>  And dealt him such a blow upon the shield,<br>  That from the shock both horse and man were hurled<br>  Backwards, flat to the earth, and though the steed<br>  Arose, the rider could not, curshed to death.<br>  At which in fear, the two remaining fled,<br>  Hoping to reach the forest; but Geraint<br>  Pursued and overtook them, and his lance<br>  Struck on the nearer's heavy shoulder-arms,<br>  And cracked the armour, but the lance itself,<br>  Strained in six former frays, brake to the haft.<br>  Whereat both bandits drew their swords, and both<br>  Attacked the prince, who with his own true glaive<br>  Received them valiantly; and while the dark<br>  Settled upon them and their figures grew<br>  Indefinite in outline, that to her<br>  Who watched with eyes dilated, now one seemed<br>  Geraint, and now another, for a space<br>  They did sharp battle, stroke and counterstroke,<br>  Tracing, traversing, matching foyne with foyne,<br>  Until at last on one assailant's helm,<br>  Geraint brought down so mightily his blade,<br>  That helm and bone and brain alike were riven,<br>  And stiffly, like a stone, the dead man fell.<br>  And in a mortal terror the fifth knight<br>  Slipped from his horse, his lance and sword and shield<br>  He flung away, and fell upon his knees,<br>  And stretched his hands in suppliance to Geraint,<br>  Shrieking, "Thy mercy, lord!"  And half in scorn<br>  And half in ruth according him the boon,<br>  Geraint dismounted, took the other's lance,<br>  Then caught the five great chargers, and all five<br>  Binding together by the bridle-reins,<br>  He gave the reins to Enid, saying to her:<br>  "As with the three, so drive the eight before;<br>  And though it seems my words have little weight,<br>  This time I charge thee with especial force,<br>  Saving I speak to thee, speak not to me!"<br>  <br>  Then in the moonless, black, wind-raving night<br>  They entered that great forest and they rode<br>  In murky labyrinths of shadowy trunks,<br>  Just visible by trebled blacknesses.<br>  And in their faces slanting sheets of rain<br>  Were driven through the canopy of leaves;<br>  And the night grew in violence, with the brief<br>  Brilliance of lightnings, and long thunder-rolls;<br>  While often the deep forest found a tongue,<br>  And spake in snap and crash of breaking boughs,<br>  And roar when roots gave way and giants fell,<br>  Crushing their neighbors downwards in the fall.<br>  And always in wild cadences that rose<br>  And died away to swell to mightier sound,<br>  Through twice ten thousand tree-tops the storm-wind<br>  Sang with stupendous music, voice of God,<br>  Of all the world, of angels, or of Hell.<br>  <br>  Then riding up to Enid's side, Geraint<br>  Saw the great difficulty which she had<br>  In driving the eight horses through the wood,<br>  By reason of the maze of nebulous trunks,<br>  And by the chargers' terror of the storm.<br>  And insofar as wrath would suffer him,<br>  The prince was moved to sorrow for her plight;<br>  And he said to her, "Lady, it is vain<br>  To attempt going forward.  It were best<br>  To bide here till the dawn."  "As thou wilt, lord,"<br>  Said Enid.  And Geraint, dismounting, took<br>  Enid down from her palfrey, and they sought<br>  A refuge from the wind and from the rain<br>  Beneath the branches of a huge old tree;<br>  And Geraint said, "Sleep, lady; I will watch."<br>  "Nay, lord," made answer Enid, "thou art worn<br>  And battle-weary.  Thou hast need for rest.<br>  Sleep thou, and I will watch."  And deeply touched<br>  He was by her concern and tenderness;<br>  Yet such a tumult still of wrath and pride<br>  Made riot in his heart, that not one word<br>  Could he say in reply, and like one dumb<br>  He lay down in his armour and he slept.<br>  And neither food nor drink they had that night.<br>  And all night long, the storm encompassing her,<br>  While Geraint slept unmindful of the din,<br>  Enid kept watch, and in her hands she held<br>  The reins of ten horses; but at last<br>  In early morning, the rain fell no more,<br>  And the wind died, and on the wood was peace;<br>  And lifting tired eyes to the brightening sky,<br>  With a wan gladness Enid saw the dawn<br>  Come to the world, and the new dawn was fair.<br>  <br>  Then in that first thin light Geraint awoke;<br>  And he was startled by the weariness,<br>  The pallor on Enid's face, and secretly<br>  A great fear grappled him lest she should die.<br>  But he said only, "Now shall we proceed."<br>  And Enid said no word of her fatigue,<br>  And of their hunger-faintness neither spake.<br>  So they rode onward through the wood, in front<br>  Enid with the eight chargers; and they fared<br>  By coverts dense and sapling-serried dells,<br>  Where from close, leafy branches, the night's rain<br>  Showered on them as they passed; and much beheld<br>  Of ravage of the storm, in scattered limbs<br>  And riven trunks and stalwart trees uptorn.<br>  And they rode on until the tempest-zone<br>  They left behind, the d&eacute;bris saw no more,<br>  And through a sparser growth they made their way,<br>  Until what time the sun had reached the height<br>  Of the second hour, emerging from the wood,<br>  They came unto a valley very fair.<br>  <br>  And there they saw a shining river flow<br>  On sands so yellow surely they were gold;<br>  And crystal-clear the water, that like jewels,<br>  The many-colored pebbles of the bed,<br>  Bright in the depths, flung back the morning sun;<br>  And by the rivage lacy willows grew,<br>  Their slender leaves tinged with autumnal gold.<br>  And on the river's farther side they saw<br>  Ripe fields of grain, and reapers reaping it,<br>  While far beyond arose the towers and spires<br>  Of a fair city ringed with radiant walls.<br>  And all the land lay shimmering in the haze<br>  Of autumn's amber sunshine; like a band<br>  Of flowing gold and crystal was the stream,<br>  Like fields of rippling gold, the feathery grain,<br>  And seeming through the fall of glamorous light<br>  To tremble like a fleeting loveliness,<br>  Fairer for evanescence, yonder towers<br>  Were as a faery city, beautiful<br>  Beyond the beauty earthly hands may build.<br>  <br>  Down to the stream rode Enid and Geraint;<br>  And eagerly the horses bent and drank<br>  Of the clear water.  Then at a wide ford,<br>  They crossed the river, by a lofty steep<br>  Ascending to the fields of golden grain.<br>  And there they met a young squire clad in brown,<br>  A leathern satchel hanging from his neck,<br>  A pitcher of bright blue within his hand,<br>  Upon the pitcher's mouth, a bright blue bowl,<br>  Around the rim whereof a cordon ran<br>  Of small, white, dancing figures, youths and maids.<br>  <br>  With courtesy the squire saluted them.<br>  "May Heaven prosper thee," replied Geraint,<br>  "And pray, whence comest thou?"  "I come," he said,<br>  "From yonder shining city.  And thou, lord--<br>  Were it presumptuous in me to ask<br>  Whence thou art come?"  "Nay, friend," returned the prince,<br>  "We came through the great forest."  "Not to-day<br>  Have ye traversed that forest.  It must be<br>  Ye spent last night therein."  "Ay, even so."<br>  "Then neither food nor drink ye had, I ween.<br>  But in this pitcher is a sweet red wine,<br>  And in this satchel have I meat and bread.<br>  Wherefore, my lord, take now a meal from me<br>  And do me honour."  "Gently said, young sir,<br>  But will no one go hungered?"  asked Geraint.<br>  "The reapers, yea; but gladly will I fetch<br>  Another breakfast for them.  Do thou eat,<br>  And thy fair lady whom I see so pale."<br>  "We will," returned Geraint, "and Heaven reward<br>  Thy thoughtful courtesy!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the prince<br>  Dismounted and took Enid from her horse.<br>  And they sat down, and skilfully the squire<br>  Served them with bread and meat and sweet red wine.<br>  And a faint colour crept to Enid's cheek,<br>  By which Geraint was gladdened.  The meal done,<br>  The squire said with all deference, "My lord,<br>  If thou wilt now permit me, I will go<br>  To fetch the reapers' breakfast."  "Yea, fair youth,"<br>  Replied the prince, "go thou, and take for us<br>  The city's choicest lodging, and good space<br>  Of stablement for the horses, and return<br>  And so conduct us thither.  And to requite<br>  Thy service and thy gift, whichever steed<br>  Pleases thee most, make choice of for thine own."<br>  Then the squire flushed with pleasure, and he sank<br>  On one knee to Geraint: "My lord, <i> thy</i>  gift<br>  Would amply pay ten services like mine."<br>  And choosing joyfully the dapple-grey,<br>  He galloped to the city, and secured<br>  The best and richest lodgings that he knew,<br>  And stabling for the horses.  Then he filled<br>  His satchel once again with reapers' fare,<br>  His cruse with wine; and afterwards he went<br>  Into the palace of his lord, Earl Dwinne,<br>  And told him the adventure.  "I go now,<br>  My lord," he said, "to squire them to the town,<br>  This knight and his fair lady."  Spake the earl:<br>  "Thou sayest the lady is so very fair?<br>  Conduct them hither!  I would welcome them,<br>  And fitly entertain them in my hall."<br>  So the youth swiftly bare to Prince Geraint<br>  The welcome of Earl Dwinne to court and hall.<br>  But Geraint answered: "Not to court nor hall<br>  Will we go, by my faith!  We know too much<br>  Of halls and courts, and folk who loiter there!<br>  Only to our own lodgings will we go;<br>  And if Earl Dwinne would greet me, let him come<br>  And visit me; I will not visit him."<br>  Then went they to the city, and they had<br>  Fair, roomy chambers, hung with scarlet silks,<br>  And spread with green, new rushes.  And the seats, <br>  Couches and tables were of carven oak,<br>  Covered with silver damask.  And Geraint<br>  Said to the squire, "Unarm me, friend, then go;<br>  But eveningwards return to wait on me."<br>  Thereon the squire departed, and the prince<br>  Spake unto Enid, "If thou hast the need<br>  Of service, call the woman of the house."<br>  "I shall, lord," answered Enid.  And Geraint<br>  Lay down upon a couch and soon he slept.<br>  And Enid also slept, but brokenly,<br>  Too over-wearied for a perfect rest.<br>  <br>  So in late undertide the squire returned<br>  To attend on Geraint, who bade him give<br>  The landlord order that he make a feast<br>  Of best and costliest fare, and that he ask<br>  Whatever friends he would to come and be<br>  The prince's guests.  And princely was the feast<br>  Which Geraint held that night, choice was the food,<br>  Age-mellow&eacute;d the wine, and all was light<br>  Of tapers and of torches, and the sheen<br>  Of silver plates and chalices of gold.<br>  But in the heart of Enid was small joy;<br>  And she arose and left the glittering board,<br>  And the gay company which heeded not,<br>  And in the farthest corner of the room<br>  Found a low bench, and there she sat alone.<br>  <br>  Thereon behold, into the festival,<br>  With twelve tall knights behind him, came Earl Dwinne,<br>  A slender, small gallant, too delicate<br>  Of form and feature for a man, and pale<br>  With the unhealthy pallor which long years<br>  Of revelries and ranging lusts do give.<br>  And with magnificence was Dwinne arrayed<br>  In azure velvet with a dust of pearls,<br>  His mantle, purfled with white ostrich plumes,<br>  The scabbard of his sword, one blaze of fire<br>  From rubies sewn in patterns of the rose;<br>  And clad in yellow satin, his twelve knights<br>  In scabbards of black damask ware their swords.<br>  Then Prince Geraint arose, and courteously <br>  Welcomed the earl, who with an easy grace<br>  Made fair rejoinder, "Heaven keep thee, Lord."<br>  And even as he did so looked beyond,<br>  And saw where Enid drooped, alone and sad.<br>  Then in their precedence they all sat down<br>  And lifted high the cups and drank, and ate.<br>  And Dwinne made inquiry of the prince's quest--<br>  The object of his journey--but Geraint<br>  Was silent for a moment, and his brow<br>  Darkened with the old cloud of jealous pain,<br>  Ere briefly he responded: "I have none<br>  Saving to seek adventures and to ride<br>  Whither my humour leads me."  "Rightly said,<br>  My lord!"  cried Dwinne.  "Chance purposes are best!<br>  Fixed purpose is a tyrant!  To thy health<br>  And good adventuring!"  And all drank deep;<br>  But none could drink more freely than the earl,<br>  And none could jest more lightly, gailier sing<br>  A drinking-song, and song and jest he made,<br>  Until what with the glowing wine and lights<br>  And ringing words and laughter, Prince Geraint<br>  Forgot his wrath and sorrow, entertained<br>  So very well he was.  And he saw not<br>  How evermore the glances of the earl<br>  Returned to rest on Enid; but she saw,<br>  Blushing for shame at their unmasked desire.<br>  <br>  So sped the time in joyance, till a troop<br>  Of minstrels entered, bearing lute and harp<br>  And violin, and sweetly played and sang.<br>  Then, on a sudden thought, Dwinne seized a lute<br>  From out the player's hand, and touched the strings<br>  To low-toned, yearning music, and a song<br>  He fashioned of the fleeting of delight:<br>  <br>  "Cull thou the day!  How could I trulier sing<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Than bidding every one who hears forbear<br>  To waste the heart in futile questioning<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;After the riddled Whither and the Where,<br>  Since than this moment is what goodlier thing?<br>  Wherefore, Belov&eacute;d, mourn not utterly;<br>  While Time shall last a little, love have we.<br>  <br>  "Grasp the sweet hour!  Bethink thee, it will pass,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;And what shall come hereafter no man knows;<br>  Already the long shadows bar the grass,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Already creeps the witherance on the rose,<br>  And swift the sands heap in the nether glass.<br>  Wherefore thy smile, Belov&eacute;d, since the sheaf<br>  Of years is small for joy, too small for grief.<br>  <br>  "Cling to the now!  What madness to explore<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;With sightless eyes the unlit ways that wend<br>  All to one blackness at the Future's shore!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;That unto all things earthly is an end,<br>  Of this alone is certainty; wherefore<br>  Give me delight, Belov&eacute;d, since the day<br>  Comes soon when all delight shall pass away."<br>  <br>  Then for a moment the bright revelry<br>  Was clouded with a sadness, which Earl Dwinne<br>  Shattered with laughter, crying, "Truth in wine!<br>  And therein let us drown it!  Know the truth--<br>  Ay, speak the truth--but drown the truth in wine!"<br>  And once again they lifted high their cups,<br>  And each man pledged his neighbor, and they drank,<br>  And the wine filled their veins with flowing fire<br>  And beat within their temples; and they drank,<br>  Finding in wine forgetfulness of the song.<br>  But Enid thought, "Why sing the song to me?"<br>  <br>  And when all were their merriest, the earl<br>  Said to Geraint, "Wilt thou permit me, lord,<br>  To speak with yonder lady?  For thy sake<br>  I fain would lay my service at her feet."<br>  "Gladly, fair friend," replied the prince, and Dwinne,<br>  Thanking him, went and sat by Enid's side;<br>  And two spear-lengths they were from Prince Geraint.<br>  <br>  And under cover of the clamorous tongues<br>  And strains of manifold music, speaking low,<br>  Said Dwinne to Enid: "Hearing the song I sang,<br>  Thou knewest it was for thee.  Thou only art<br>  My soul's desire in whom is my delight!"<br>  But Enid, with sweet statelihood and grace,<br>  Though paling at the lust in his regard,<br>  Answered, "My lord, thou doest thyself a wrong<br>  No less than me, in uttering such words<br>  To which I will not hearken in any wise."<br>  Said Dwinne, "Consider well!  Rather wouldst thou<br>  Then, lady, follow a man who loves thee not<br>  Than bide with one who loves thee as his life?"<br>  But Enid, though the words smote on her heart<br>  With forceful pain, responded, "With my lord<br>  Rather would I go always--with my knight,<br>  My first love and my last, who loves me well--<br>  Yea, spite of all, I know he loves me well!"<br>  <br>  Whereto said Dwinne: "Nay, is his love so great?<br>  His treatment of thee sounds another tale.<br>  Thou art a gentlewoman, reared to rank<br>  And tenderest usage, and of feature fair<br>  Beyond my thought of women.  Not for thee<br>  Should paths be rough and wounding; yet this man<br>  Drags thee perforce upon an aimless quest,<br>  That hath no profit but only peril in it, <br>  And to the pressure of any evil chance<br>  Subjects thee needlessly, just at his will!<br>  But I would guard thee in fair pleasaunces,<br>  Laced in with roses yellow as the sun,<br>  And make thy life no heavier than a dream<br>  Couched upon swan's-down, balmed with musk and myrrh.<br>  He loves thee well!  Yet silken stuffs of green<br>  Are in his coat and surcoat; green and gold,<br>  The plumes upon his helmet; and his mail<br>  Is of a triple steel inwrought with gold.<br>  Oh, never knight-at-arms more gay than he!--<br>  And never beggar-woman, more than thou!<br>  But I will clothe thee in the finest vair<br>  The furriers have for queenhood; cisclations,<br>  Scarlets and Alexandrian brocades--<br>  All these shall be for thee when thou art mine.<br>  Lo, how he loves thee!  Neither youth nor maid<br>  He gives for thine attendance; thine own hands<br>  Must do each several task, however mean--<br>  His lady to a serving-wench constrained!<br>  But in my palace are there youths and maids,--<br>  A hundred, and not one but is most fair,<br>  A hundred, and not one but gently born--<br>  And all shall call thee 'Lady,' and be thine.<br>  Leave him and come with me!  I love thee so!<br>  Thy hair is as a brightness to my soul<br>  Whereto is seldom brightness!  Stay with me,<br>  And I will cherish thee for evermore!"<br>  <br>  But Enid said: "Shall I not go with him<br>  In whom is my affiance and my trust,<br>  For whom is all the love that I shall know?<br>  These things thou sayest, O my lord, are true;<br>  And why these things are true I can not tell;<br>  And that these things are true drags at my heart.<br>  And yet because my love is such a strength,<br>  With him must I go always to the end.<br>  And since it is so, for thy knighthood's sake,<br>  Let us depart in peace!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By God!" cried Dwinne,<br>  And though his tones were low, his burning eyes<br>  Consumed her with their passion, "If I do,<br>  Without one clasping of thy loveliness,<br>  Then may my foemen slay me in my hall,<br>  Mine earldom pass to strangers!  Hearken thou!<br>  Thee I will have, won by whatever means!<br>  Unarmed is yonder man; a single word--<br>  My twelve knights flesh their swords within his breast;<br>  And while his head turns carrion on my walls--<br>  A shuddering and a horror--thou shalt be,<br>  Whether thou wilt or no, my latest bride,<br>  The fairest of all ladies I have seen--<br>  I never knew a face could be so fair.<br>  But so thou comest to me willingly,<br>  I will not slay this man, nor prison him:<br>  He shall go free."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then like to one who gropes<br>  Through an enshrouding blackness, through his words<br>  Did Enid grope, already in her eyes<br>  The vision of Geraint pale in his blood;<br>  And only could she think, "He will be slain!<br>  How shall my lord, unarmed, contend with twelve?<br>  Ay, were he armed, he would be slain by twelve!"<br>  And then her woman's wit devised a way,<br>  And she made answer: "Lord, thy will is mine.<br>  Come with the morrowing and take me hence.<br>  But for to-night I pray thee let me be.<br>  Small pleasure wouldst thou have of me to-night;<br>  For I am like to swoon of my fatigues,<br>  For on me is a lethargy like death."<br>  Arose Earl Dwinne and bowed and took his leave,<br>  And all his knights went with him, with the rout<br>  Of townsmen following, that so the room<br>  Cleared quickly, and again they were alone,<br>  Geraint and Enid.  And because she thought,<br>  "To speak now of the treachery of Dwinne<br>  Were needlessly to rob my lord of rest,<br>  Which he must have to battle with the foes<br>  Who in these lands beset us everywhere,"<br>  Enid said naught of peril at that time,<br>  And wordlessly Geraint lay down and slept.<br>  But lest she overlie the hour for flight,<br>  Enid fought sleep, and noiselessly she placed<br>  At Geraint's side his armour, piece by piece,<br>  As he should don it.  And the night wore on,<br>  And still she kept her vigil; but so tired<br>  She was with dole and unaccustomed toils<br>  That all unwittingly her head sank low--<br>  She slept and dreamed, and in her dream she seemed<br>  To hear the beat of hoofs innumerable<br>  Of fast-pursuing steeds and clang of arms;<br>  And in affright she started up and stared<br>  Wildly about, and saw the east was grey,<br>  Slit with the red line of an angry dawn;<br>  And down the stony streets the heavy carts<br>  Went to bring in the harvest, rumbling loud<br>  Upon the paving-stones,--the pound of hoofs<br>  And din of arms which she had heard in dream.<br>  Then smiling wanly at such fantasies,<br>  She stole to Geraint's couch, and placed her hand<br>  Lightly upon his brow, awakening him,<br>  And whisperingly she said, "Arise, my lord,<br>  And arm thyself before it be too late."<br>  And when he did so, wondering at her words,<br>  She told him all the traitorous speech of Dwinne<br>  And her own answer.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly then Geraint,<br>  Calling his host, required the reckoning.<br>  "Thou owest me but little," said the man.<br>  "Will seven chargers pay thee?"  "Truly, lord,<br>  One were too much."  "Take seven," said the prince,<br>  "And bring our own two horses to the door.<br>  And wilt thou guide us to the city walls?<br>  I would depart from town a different way<br>  From that by which I entered."  "Noble sir,<br>  My will is but to serve thee," he returned.<br>  <br>  So through the twilight of the tortuous streets<br>  He guided them, and through the western gate,<br>  From which outled a highroad.  There Geraint<br>  Dismissed him, saying:  "Our great thanks, good friend!<br>  Need of thy farther guidance have we none.<br>  Farewell and Heaven keep thee!"  "And keep thee,<br>  My lord, and thy fair lady!"  said the host,<br>  And left them, with a glad heart hastening home.<br>  But when he reached his house, surrounding it<br>  He saw the twelve chief knights of the Earl Dwinne,<br>  Mounted on snorting horses, men and steeds<br>  Clad all in heavy armour, and each knight<br>  Bare a long lance of battle.  And he saw<br>  The earl's proud charger at the mounting-stage,<br>  Champing his golden snaffle.  And the earl<br>  Rushed from the entrance, crying, "They are gone!"<br>  Then saw the trembling landlord, ran to him,<br>  With sword uplifted forced him to his knees:<br>  "Thou villain, didst thou suffer them to escape?"<br>  "Ah, my lord earl, I had no word from thee<br>  That I restrain them."  "Which way did they go?"<br>  "Forth by the western highroad."  And Earl Dwinne<br>  Into his saddle sprang, dashed deep the rowels,<br>  Brandished his naked sword above his head,<br>  And shouting "Follow!" at a speed that recked<br>  Nothing of others' lives nor of his own,<br>  Galloped through street and square and gate, and rode<br>  Until far in the distance he beheld<br>  Two moving figures, Enid and Geraint;<br>  And his own shout of triumph was twelve times <br>  Multiplied as his knights rushed to the prey.<br>  <br>  And Enid, by Geraint's will riding first,<br>  Heard the fierce clamor, distance-thinned yet clear;<br>  And looking back she saw a dust-cloud roll<br>  Rapidly down the highroad, and the forms<br>  Of furious riders loomed within the mist,<br>  Their armour glinting fitfully.  Then in dread<br>  Greater than aught she yet had known, she turned<br>  And rode back to Geraint, crying aloud,<br>  "My lord, my lord, defend thee, for they come!<br>  The host of Dwinne will hew thee to thy death!"<br>  <br>  And suddenly Geraint wheeled his destrier<br>  To face his foes and feutred fast his lance.<br>  And in the moment on him seven knights<br>  Bare headlong, captained by the seneschal<br>  Of the earl's household.  But the mighty charge<br>  Steadfastly he received, that like a wave<br>  Which hurls its thunderous volume on a rock,<br>  And can not move it, and the wave is split,<br>  And all force is spent in impotent spray<br>  Which swirls and eddies harmlessly beyond,<br>  They split upon his firmness and swirled by,<br>  But leaderless, for at his stirrup dragged<br>  The seneschal, face downwards in the dust.<br>  And Geraint wheeled and spurred into the midst<br>  Of the returning seven, and with seven<br>  At once did he engage, thrilling with lance,<br>  Slashing with pitiless sword, that evermore<br>  They yielded ground before him, for like those<br>  About whom olden legends hang, he fought--<br>  Like Eldol, Earl of Gloucester, with the blades<br>  Of treachery contending, or like him<br>  Before whose single sword battalions fell,<br>  Rhuvawn, the chief of kings.  So fought Geraint<br>  Till of the seven only three remained<br>  To fight ever again, and gaping wounds<br>  They had, all three, and in a common fear<br>  They quailed beneath the warrior's circling sword,<br>  And cowered before the eagles on his shield,<br>  And fled back to their master.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the wrath<br>  Of Dwinne was changed to fury.  Hard he drave<br>  Into his charger's side the maddening spur<br>  And whirlwind-violent lashed upon Geraint.<br>  But like the slenderest reed by autumn meres<br>  His lance brake on the prince's stubborn shield,<br>  Splintering to his fingers, while Geraint's,<br>  Mightfully thrust and surely, cleft in twain<br>  The attacker's shield, rent wide his useless mail,<br>  Entered his body to a mortal hurt,<br>  And with a sharp scream Dwinne threw out his arms<br>  And fell from his horse, dead.  Whereat his knights,<br>  Wounded and those unwounded, flung away<br>  Their weapons, and dismounting, came and knelt<br>  Before the victor, saying, "Mercy, lord!"<br>  And merciful was Geraint, and rode aside<br>  And said to Enid, "Do we now proceed."<br>  So on the highway they rode forth again.<br>  <br>  But sadly, with much weeping, did the knights<br>  Place their dead master on a shield's reverse,<br>  And bear him to his city.  Thus died Dwinne,<br>  By his own lorded passions slain at last,<br>  Earl Dwinne, yet in the summer-flush of youth.<br>  <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> III</b> <br>  <br>  With a fierce brightness the autumnal sun<br>  Blazed at an hour to noon, when, journeying fast<br>  Along the highroad, Enid and Geraint<br>  The slain earl's ultimate marches overfared,<br>  And saw below them a low range of hills,<br>  Green, greenish-brown, and tending into grey.<br>  These climbing, from the summit they beheld<br>  A valley fair and wide, of fertile fields<br>  Russet and gold with harvest, wherein folk<br>  Reaped grain or gathered fruits, and through the vale,<br>  Rushing and roaring like a storm, a stream<br>  Tumbled the liquid thunder of a flood<br>  Hued black and livid by the sombre rocks<br>  Of its deep bed.  And windingly the road<br>  Descended to the valley, there in twain<br>  Dividing, of which one, with gradual grade,<br>  Ribboned the low flank of the farther hills;<br>  Whereas the other, level, broad and straight,<br>  Ran to a bridge of heavy masonry,<br>  Spanning the river, and above the bridge,<br>  Upon the opposite side of that dark stream,<br>  They saw a fair, strong castle, massive-walled, <br>  High-towered and widely-moated, and they thought<br>  No man had builded better than the lord<br>  Who reared this so fair fortress.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they rode<br>  Down from the hill-top and approached the place<br>  Where the two highways parted, and they saw<br>  A peasant toiling in a field close by,<br>  Sheaving the grain.  To him spake Prince Geraint:<br>  "Tell me, I pray thee, who thy liege lord is,<br>  Lord likewise of this valley and of yon towers."<br>  "A king, Guivret the Little," said the man,<br>  "And a most valiant champion.  Wherefore, sir,<br>  I warn thee shouldst thou choose the lower road<br>  And cross the bridge and ride beneath his walls,<br>  Thy lot were like to be disgrace and shame,<br>  Since every knight who comes upon his lands<br>  He forces to a combat, and not one<br>  But in the end must yield him to my king."<br>  "Nevertheless, by that way will I go,"<br>  Replied Geraint, and Enid riding first,<br>  They crossed the bridge and passed beneath the towers.<br>  <br>  But when they had proceeded a short space,<br>  The thud of iron-shod hoofs smote on their ears,<br>  A voice behind them cried, "Oh, keep thee, knight!<br>  For thy presumption shalt thou dearly pay,<br>  Daring to enter these forbidden lands!"<br>  And Geraint, turning, set his lance in rest.<br>  And lo, upon a war horse great and strong,<br>  Dark bay in colour, nostrils scarlet-wide,<br>  A knight who ware above his shining mail<br>  A silken surcoat of the colour of Inde,<br>  Rushed towards him, and the prince had never seen<br>  A man of smaller stature than this knight.<br>  And at such fearful pace the charger came<br>  That finer than a millstone grinds the corn,<br>  He ground the stones beneath his clanging hoofs,<br>  And sparks flew outward from him like a fire;<br>  And backwards in the wind of that wild speed<br>  Were borne the milk-white plumes of the knight's crest<br>  And the blue pennon streaming from his lance;<br>  And to the blazon on his dark blue shield,<br>  An argent lion couchant, leaping life<br>  Seemed by that headlong motion to be given.<br>  <br>  Then Geraint spurred to meet him, and the shock<br>  Of their encountering was so merciless<br>  That both their steeds were beaten to the earth.<br>  They rose and charged again, and yet again,<br>  With iron-tipped lances gave such fearful strokes,<br>  Each to the other, that they rased away<br>  The paintures and the colours from their shields;<br>  And often through the leather and the wood<br>  The sharp spears drave, through plate and inner mail,<br>  And pierced their bodies and made gaping wounds;<br>  But always it was difficult for Geraint<br>  To battle with the other, whose small size<br>  Rendered sure aim scarce possible.  They fought<br>  Until both horses fell upon their knees<br>  From sheer exhaustion, and both knights were thrown<br>  Heavily to the ground.  But they arose,<br>  Despite their grievous hurts, and drew their swords,<br>  Hurtling together fiercely, and on foot<br>  Fought stubbornly and long, until their shields<br>  Shielded no more, but splintered wood become,<br>  And fluttering rags of leather; and their arms<br>  Were crushed and hewed and hacked to the bare flesh;<br>  And they swayed both with weakness, and the light<br>  Of the broad day grew darkness to their eyes,<br>  And a red vapor of blood.  And all the while<br>  Enid looked on, with neither scream nor tear;<br>  For past all ease of weeping was her woe,<br>  And past all utterance.  But on her face<br>  Was a grey rigor like to naught save death,<br>  And in her gaze, a straitness over-tense;<br>  And ever one hand kept clutching at her throat,<br>  Her fingers bruising red the soft, white flesh,<br>  And she not knowing it.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they fought long,<br>  Till finally within the prince's mind,<br>  Blood-clouded, pain-distorted, a dim thought<br>  Unconsciously took form:  "One stroke--my last!<br>  If good, I live; if not,--" and all his strength,<br>  Or rather, the poor remnants of his strength,<br>  Summoning to him, like a thrower of dice<br>  Who stakes his all upon a single cast,<br>  He lifted high his blade, and such a blow<br>  Dealt on his foeman's helm that circlewise<br>  The sword flew from the hand of the Little King,<br>  And dizzily he slipped down to his knees.<br>  <br>  Then in the curious monotone of pain<br>  Scarce bearable, yet borne without a sign,<br>  Guivret said, "I am yolden to thy grace;<br>  Of the fair fight the victory is thine."<br>  To which, with mirthless smile, Geraint replied:<br>  "Thereof hath no man victory.  But of grace,<br>  Guivret the Little, will I freely grant,<br>  If thou wilt be mine ally, and engage<br>  To fight against me never, but to bring<br>  Me succor if thou hearest I have the need."<br>  "This will I, gladly, lord," answered Guivret;<br>  So pledged his faith.  "And since my name to thee<br>  Is not unknown, right fain would I know thine."<br>  "Geraint, the son of Erbin," said the prince;<br>  "Geraint, a name of battles!" said the king;<br>  "The bearer of the goodly eagle-shield,<br>  Geraint, the sword of Devon!  O my lord,<br>  Come with me to Pen&eacute;vric by the Stream,<br>  Yon castle, which now owns thee for its liege.<br>  There my two sisters, skilled in surgery,<br>  Will cure our dolorous wounds."  But Geraint said,<br>  "I thank thee, but I go upon my way."<br>  <br>  Then Guivret looked at Enid, where she stood;<br>  And grieved that one of her so noble mien,<br>  That one so beautiful, should have such woe.<br>  And he said to Geraint:  "Thy course is wrong,<br>  My lord, yea, greatly wrong; if peril rise<br>  Before thee in thy weakness and thy hurts,<br>  What prospering canst thou hope?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But wilfully<br>  The prince responded, "I have answered thee."<br>  And though his wounds bled deathfully, and the throb<br>  And ache of them was torture, he would do<br>  Nothing but mount his horse, feutre his lance,<br>  Abandon his unserviceable shield,<br>  Bid Enid ride on first, and so depart;<br>  While in a helpless pity for them both<br>  Looked after them Guivret the Little King.<br>  <br>  But on the highroad Enid and Geraint<br>  Proceeded till they saw before them lie<br>  A vast, deep forest.  And the afternoon<br>  Was like the height of summer for the close<br>  Of stifling, windless heat; and for the blood<br>  Which covered all his body like a pall,<br>  The prince's armour cleaved unto his flesh,<br>  And all his hurts pulsed with the fever-fire.<br>  Wherefore most cool and grateful looked the wood,<br>  And entering it, they halted in the shade.<br>  <br>  As they thus rested, suddenly from the wood<br>  Shrilled forth a piteous wailing, and the voice<br>  Was of a woman seeming crazed with grief.<br>  "Lady, do we ride forward," said Geraint,<br>  "And learn what this betokens."  And they rode,<br>  Threading the dark, still thickets, and at last<br>  Came to a grassy glade, wherein they saw<br>  Two horses standing, one, a knight's destrier,<br>  The other, a lady's palfrey.  There behold,<br>  Upon the trodden, blood-besprinkled grass,<br>  His battered helm beside him, prostrate lay<br>  A young knight in white armour, a mere boy<br>  With yellow, curling hair, and he was dead.<br>  And a young maid in a grey riding-dress<br>  Knelt at his side, her eyes wildered with grief.<br>  And ever and anon she flung herself<br>  Upon the dead knight, kissing lips and hair,<br>  Chafing his hands, beseeching him to speak,<br>  With such exceeding weeping and such wails<br>  That it was sorrow both to see and hear;<br>  And Enid, looking, shuddered, for she thought,<br>  "A day like this will come also to me!"<br>  <br>  "Ah! Lady," queried Prince Geraint in ruth,<br>  "What hath befallen thee?"  "My love is slain!"<br>  She moaned in answer; "Without cause is slain!<br>  We journeyed to the court of King Guivret,<br>  Where was to be our wedding on the morn;<br>  But here two villains met us, giants both,<br>  And both at once they set upon my love,<br>  And without cause they slew him where he lies!"<br>  Then in a generous anger sware Geraint,<br>  "Slaying, they shall be slain!  Where are they now?"<br>  "They went by yonder path, but he is dead!"<br>  Then fell she to her dolour, and Geraint<br>  Spake unto Enid:  "Do thou bide with her,<br>  Enid, for she is like to die of grief.<br>  And when I have avenged her, I shall come."<br>  <br>  So by the bridle-path he rode away;<br>  And Enid in mute terror saw him go,<br>  Thinking of his great wounds, the giants' strength,<br>  Quite certain that he never would return;<br>  And smitten by the thought that but for her,<br>  Even though all unwilling, but for her,<br>  This hapless quest had never been begun.<br>  And then she looked upon the girl, so young<br>  And fair and in such sorrow, and her heart<br>  Was stirred with pity poignant as a pain.<br>  And she dismounted quickly, went to her,<br>  Knelt by her, took her in her arms, and kissed<br>  Her eyes and stroked her hair, and soothed, and said<br>  Sweet woman-words of comfort which she felt<br>  Futile while uttering them.  And the girl clung,<br>  Her face to Enid's breast, and at the last<br>  Grew very still and silent.  "Can she sleep?"<br>  Mused Enid, but up-turning the white face,<br>  Drew back in a slow horror, for she slept<br>  Indeed,--the sleep of death.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Geraint<br>  Caught sight of the two murderers, and in brawn<br>  And stature they were giants in good truth.<br>  Each looked to have the strength of two strong men,<br>  Each carried on his shoulder a huge club,<br>  Knotted, and braced with iron.  Crying to them,<br>  "For slaying yonder knight yourselves shall die!"<br>  The prince rushed on them, with his long spear thrust<br>  The nearer through the body that he died.<br>  But ere he could pluck forth the lance again,<br>  The other giant struck him with his club,<br>  Crushing his side and shoulder, that his wounds,<br>  Partially closed and stanched, opened anew<br>  And from him all his blood began to flow.<br>  Yet Geraint drew his sword and made attack,<br>  And gave a blow so violent on the crown<br>  Of the giant's head that bone and brain were split,<br>  And he fell dead.  Then careless that he left<br>  His lance still fixed within his first foe's breast,<br>  Fainting from loss of blood, with one desire,<br>  One only, to reach her he loved so well,<br>  Geraint returned to Enid, where she sat<br>  Between the dead young lovers, and her eyes<br>  Brightened at seeing him, but when he came<br>  Before her, he fell swooning from his horse.<br>  <br>  And Enid gave a moaning, stifled cry;<br>  And flung herself upon him, calling him,<br>  Entreating him to speak to her, but Geraint<br>  Lay in so deep a swoon it seemed his death.<br>  And then a numbing fear gripped Enid's heart;<br>  And though with nerveless fingers she undid<br>  The buckles of his armour, and laid bare<br>  The dreadful wounds, and from her hem tore strips,<br>  And wiped the blood away and bound his hurts,<br>  Ever it seemed to her she did a thing<br>  Which she had done before, so strong the sense<br>  Had been upon her of a woe to come.<br>  And when at last, his head upon her lap<br>  Placing, she sat and gazed at his dear face,<br>  She neither wept nor wailed; her eyes were dry<br>  And bright as with a fever, and her lips<br>  Kept whispering just the words, "Dead?  Dead, my love?<br>  And dead because of me?"  And to and fro<br>  Her body rocking slightly, thus she sat,<br>  Whispering, "Dead?  And dead because of me?"<br>  <br>  So waned the afternoon, until the rays<br>  Of the low sun wrought glory in the glade,<br>  Kindling to gold the foliage.  Then the dusk<br>  Fell with a chill of autumn.  Long before<br>  Had Enid's palfrey and the lovers' steeds<br>  Strayed far into the forest; but looking down<br>  With sorrow almost human in its eyes,<br>  Like faithfullest of friends, Geraint's destrier<br>  Remained by Enid quietly.  And the dusk<br>  Deepened to dark, but Enid knew it not--<br>  Knew neither light nor change to dusk nor dark,<br>  For to her all was blackness.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Behold,<br>  Upon a sudden through the forest streamed<br>  The smoky flare of torches, and the combes<br>  And alleys of the wood rang with the shouts<br>  And jests and oaths of fierce and lawless men.<br>  Then upon steaming horses flecked with foam,<br>  Into the hollow glade was poured the band<br>  Of ruffians of the ruffian Earl Limours,<br>  Returning from a foray, with the spoils<br>  Of sackage bound about their saddle-bows.<br>  And in the forefront, on a huge, black horse,<br>  His shield an empty blackness, and his spear<br>  Grim with the hue of carnage, rode Limours,<br>  A man of mighty stature, with a cruel<br>  And swarthy countenance.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once the earl<br>  Saw Enid and rode to her, with an oath<br>  Saying, "What have we here?  A woman lone,<br>  With dead at either side, and in her lap,<br>  One who will live not long in any case!"<br>  Roughly to Enid then, "Does he live yet,<br>  The one thou holdest?"  Dully she replied,<br>  As if another spake in place of her,<br>  "I know not, but I fear that he is dead."<br>  "Who is he?"  asked Limours.  "A knight and prince."<br>  "And thou--art thou his wife or lady-love?"<br>  "Both, both," said Enid.  Whereupon Limours,<br>  With a harsh laugh, gave ordering to his men:<br>  "Quick!  Make a sapling-litter for the man<br>  And carry him to our hall, where we shall learn<br>  Whether he live or die.  And take his steed--<br>  The horse at least may pay us for our pains.<br>  As to the two dead bodies, let them lie."<br>  And then again to Enid:  "But as for thee,<br>  I share with thee my charger.  For know well<br>  A fair face, even though bemarred with grief,<br>  Is never slighted by the Earl Limours."<br>  <br>  Which saying, he had Enid lifted up<br>  And placed before him on the saddle-cloth;<br>  While quickly his wild vassals used their brands<br>  To cut two saplings upon which they laid<br>  Branches crosswise, and on these placed Geraint,<br>  His sword beside him.  And in such array<br>  They journeyed to the stronghold of Limours.<br>  <br>  And great and gaunt and menacing was the hall<br>  They entered, with a floor of naked stone,<br>  And walls of stone begrimed by smoke and age;<br>  Hung with fantastic cobwebs etched in soot,<br>  Hung with old shields and helms, old spears and swords,<br>  Eaten away with rust, and tattered flags<br>  Fretted about the blood-stains,--booty all<br>  Of  ravagings in old years.  A fire flamed high<br>  In a vast, blackened fireplace; torches set<br>  In rusted iron burned fitfully; down the room,<br>  Ranged in long rows, were tables and their banks<br>  Of bare, unfinished boards.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And upon these<br>  The followers of Limours flung down the fruits<br>  Of the day's foray--glittering, costly heaps:<br>  Hauberks of silver mail, and helms and greaves<br>  Inlaid with gold, and swords with jewell&eacute;d hilts;<br>  Much silver plate, beakers and cups of gold,<br>  Hanaps adorned with gems; and spurs and bits,<br>  All of fine gold; and piles of various coins;<br>  And surcoats of green satin, women's gowns<br>  Of scarlet lined with minever, kirtles blue,<br>  And mantles furred with ermine; while of rings,<br>  Girdles and carcanets of twisted gold<br>  And many gem-encrusted, such a sum<br>  That onerous were the counting.  Then the earl<br>  Made the apportionment, to every man<br>  Gave what he deemed was rightful, silencing<br>  Any half-muttered word of discontent<br>  With curses and with blows of his mailed hand;<br>  And that which was the largest share and best<br>  He for himself reserved.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Prince Geraint,<br>  Still in his swoon upon the leafy bier,<br>  Limours caused to be placed upon a couch<br>  In the center of the hall, and Enid sat<br>  Beside him on a low bench, with her arms<br>  Stretched over him, her cheek against his hand;<br>  And neither did she weep nor did she wail.<br>  <br>  And Limours doffed his armour, and his men<br>  Did likewise, and a shout rose for the feast.<br>  So entered kitchen-fellows, on huge trays<br>  Bearing whole wild boars roasted, bullock's flesh,<br>  Bittern and other fowl; and casks of wine<br>  Were rolled into the hall; the tables set<br>  With trenchers and with flagons and with cups--<br>  A table-service of which some was wood,<br>  And much was silver, ay, and part was gold.<br>  And then in flaunting garments tricked with jewels<br>  Too many, and with jangling chains of gold,<br>  A throng of women came into the hall,<br>  The wantons of the earl and of his men.<br>  And all sat down together to the feast,<br>  And ate and drank, and presently the talk<br>  Grew fast and boisterous, the jesting broad,<br>  The laughter gross, and always some would raise<br>  Snatches of shameless songs.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Earl Limours,<br>  With scarce a taste of food or sip of wine,<br>  Pushed cup and platter from him; moodily<br>  And with a dangerous lowering of brows<br>  Sat, with his eyes on Enid; and at last<br>  He rose and went to her, and seized her arm,<br>  And pulled her to her feet, and spake to her:<br>  <br>  "Why dost thou grieve for him?  If he be dead<br>  Will thy dole give him life?  And if he live,<br>  It matters not--he were as dead to thee.<br>  For I have set my heart on having thee,<br>  And I <i> will</i>  have thee, not by any man<br>  Living or dead, be barred from my desire.<br>  Why starest thou so?  The change is good enough,--<br>  God knows, all to thy vantaging.  Thou hast seen<br>  What riches one day brings me; I have lands<br>  And vassals who obey me to the death.<br>  And riches, lands and vassals shall be thine.<br>  So!  Droop no more!  I have no taste for grief.<br>  It is my pleasure that my women smile;<br>  Remember that!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going to the heap<br>  Of pillage that was his, he plucked a robe<br>  Of scarlet damask from it, and returned<br>  And thrust it towards her: "Go, and doff thy rags,<br>  And clothe thee in this dress and come to me!"<br>  But Enid, shaken from her apathy<br>  By his discourteousness, stood white and straight<br>  And resolute before him, answering him,<br>  "My lord commanded me to wear this gown;<br>  And till his will be changed, I wear it still."<br>  <br>  And the earl flushed with anger, and his brows<br>  Drew to a savage scowl; yet with his wrath<br>  Unwilling admiration he must mix<br>  For her defiance of him, in his power<br>  Completely as she was.  Never before<br>  Had he known woman who could dare so much.<br>  A moment he stood speechless; then he turned<br>  And drew her to the table, forced her down<br>  Into the seat by his, and pushed a plate<br>  Of steaming meat before her and he said,<br>  "I will forbear this once; but eat with me."<br>  <br>  But Enid said:  "Till yon pale man arise<br>  And part the plate with me, I will not eat."<br>  Raging, Limours replied:  "A fool art thou!<br>  Yon man is dead already.  What avail<br>  To take a vow that can not be fulfilled?<br>  Is thy wit weak?  I warn thee, have a care,<br>  Lest I be angered from my gentleness,<br>  And teach thee what it means to disobey.<br>  Once more will I forbear; but drink with me."<br>  <br>  But Enid pushed the heavy cup of gold,<br>  Studded with rubies, with a red wine brimmed,<br>  From her and said, "Till yon still man arise<br>  And part the cup with me, I will not drink."<br>  <br>  Then in a crimson fury, with the veins<br>  Knotting upon his forehead, the black earl<br>  Sprang from the bench, and with a grip that pained<br>  Caught Enid by the shoulder, held her fast<br>  At arm's length, raised his hand, crying aloud,<br>  "As well may I be rough as gentle with thee!"<br>  But when he made to strike, of his men one<br>  Who had been born to nobler circumstance,<br>  Remembering her he loved in that far youth,<br>  Ere riot blasted him, arose and ran<br>  And interposed himself before Limours,<br>  Sheltering Enid.  "It were better, lord,"<br>  He said, "to use her gently.  She is fair,<br>  Womanly with a perfect womanhood."<br>  <br>  But the earl, answering not, drew back a step,<br>  Snatched up the massy hanap, poised it high,<br>  Hurled it with fatal certaintly of aim,--<br>  It struck the liegeman's temple and he reeled,<br>  Groped with unsteady hand, then with a sigh<br>  Sank in the pool of spilt wine and of blood<br>  From the cut oozing, writhed once, and was still.<br>  <br>  Then even that brutal fellowship was stirred<br>  To a dull anger 'gainst the murderer;<br>  And dark looks were passed slowly down the board,<br>  And all at once the feast came to an end;<br>  And in the ghastly silence one who well<br>  Had loved the slain man, sobbed--and caught her breath<br>  Suddenly in sharp fear, and tried to smile,<br>  Finding Limours' eyes on her.  And Limours,<br>  Feeling the gathering menace of his men,<br>  Maddened the more, and as if demon-driven<br>  He drew to Enid, saying, "Learnest thou well<br>  How they who cross me fare!  And as with him,<br>  Why not with thee?"  and struck her in the face<br>  With heavy hand!<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not so much the blow<br>  It was as the mind-desolating thought<br>  "He had not dared, saving my lord <i> is</i>  dead!"<br>  That forced a cry from Enid, loud and shrill,<br>  Wailing and vibrant through the echoing hall,--<br>  The cry of one for whom all things are done.<br>  <br>  But in the black abysses of his swoon<br>  Prince Geraint heard, and struggled towards the cry;<br>  Battled through sheer eternities, it seemed,<br>  With seething, formless horrors, some that mowed,<br>  Some yelling voicelessly--an offspring all<br>  Of consciousness returning--and at last<br>  Leaped from the couch, and the great, lighted hall<br>  Burst on his vision and the savage earl,<br>  And the dead man prone in the wine and blood,<br>  And Enid trembling from the blow, and pale<br>  As palest death.  And Geraint seized his sword<br>  And rushed upon Limours, and with one blow<br>  Struck head from body, and all they that sat<br>  About the board, upstarting, fled from him,<br>  Their faces ashen at the sight they saw,<br>  Shrieking, "It is the dead man!"  And the hall<br>  Cleared in a moment of all enemies.<br>  <br>  And Geraint folded Enid in his arms,<br>  Kissing her on the throat and lips, and hair;<br>  And clasped the face he loved in yearning hands,<br>  And clasped her body in poor, faltering hands,<br>  And knelt and pressed his cheek against her gown,<br>  Kissing the robe's thin tatters, all the while<br>  Whispering, "O Belov&eacute;d, what am I?<br>  O dear my love, how have I treated thee!<br>  O dear beyond all words, how dealt with thee!<br>  Forgive, forgive!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Enid saw alone<br>  How shuddering fits of weakness mastered him,<br>  How his hands quivered brokenly, and her fear<br>  For him was such she could not say a word<br>  Of love or any comforting--naught but this:<br>  "Go, go, my lord!  Go, ere they come again!<br>  Geraint, go ere they slay thee!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he rose:<br>  "Come, we shall go together;" and they passed<br>  Into the courtyard, where Geraint's destrier<br>  Stood saddled and still bridled.  And Geraint<br>  Mounted and drew up Enid, and she sat<br>  Behind him with her arms about his waist.<br>  And none came forth to hinder their escape,<br>  When from the grim hall of the grim Limours<br>  Rapidly through the night they rode away;<br>  And a sweet wind was hurrying o'er the world,<br>  And wreathed in wisp-like clouds the moon was sheen.<br>  <br>  And Geraint said: "Belov&eacute;d, shall we ride<br>  Unto a brighter world and fairer life,--<br>  Ay, fairer for the weight of lifted woe?<br>  I love thee; I have wronged thee; all my vows--<br>  To cherish thee with such exceeding care,<br>  To prove me not unworthy of thy love--<br>  I brake them all, in all am I forsworn.<br>  And yet forgive me, Enid, whom I love<br>  So very, very well."  And tenderly<br>  She forward bent and kissed him as they rode;<br>  And Love was come again to his high place,<br>  And in two hearts was joyance at the last.<br>  <br>  So they fared onward by a grassy way<br>  Between two hawthorn-hedges, and the night<br>  Was like a web of silver on the land.<br>  But lo, before them, sharp against the sky<br>  They saw the points of lances, heard the noise<br>  Of an approaching host.  Then Prince Geraint,<br>  Checking his charger, said: "Who these may be,<br>  I know not; but dismount, Enid, and hide<br>  In yonder deepest shadow of the hedge,<br>  Where they may not perceive thee."  But she wept<br>  And clung to him in anguish:  "O my love,<br>  So weak and wounded, without lance or shield,<br>  How wilt thou make a stand against these men?<br>  Let me stay with thee and thy lot be mine!"<br>  "Nay," he replied, "I pray thee by our love,<br>  Enid, to hide."  And lest he suffer more,<br>  She did as he would have her.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then behold,<br>  Armed in full armour, with long spear in rest,<br>  Upon a powerful, rushing steed, a knight<br>  Forthissued from the host against Geraint.<br>  And Enid saw, and seeing had such dole<br>  As might not be contained, and she ran out<br>  To meet the galloping steed, and wildly cried,<br>  "O knight, eternal shame be thy reward<br>  Slaying a man forwounded!"  But the knight,<br>  Reining his horse so sharply that it hurled<br>  Back on its haunches, answered, "Do I see<br>  Geraint's fair lady?"  "Ah, but thou?" she said--<br>  And then the moonfire showed upon his shield<br>  The argent lion of the Little King,<br>  Guivret, their friend and ally.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Guivret,<br>  Lightly dismounting, knelt and kissed her hand,<br>  Then ran to Prince Geraint, saying, "My lord,<br>  If I had slain thee, grief had been my death.<br>  I came to bring thee help if there was need.<br>  For after that I saw thee ride away<br>  This undertide, and went back to my towers,<br>  Ever must I be thinking of thy wounds,<br>  Thy lady's wondrous beauty, and the lands<br>  Perilous of the evil Earl Limours.<br>  I could not rest from thinking, and I rose<br>  To call my thousand knights and men-at-arms--"<br>  "And wounded as thou wert," brake in Geraint,<br>  "To bring to me the help I greatly need.<br>  Ah, friend, <i> thine</i>  oath was more than empty words!"<br>  "Lord," said the Little King, "I am thy man,<br>  And love is there between us, as I hope.<br>  And now I say again what I have said:<br>  Come with me to my castle and be healed,<br>  For grievous are thy hurts.  And if not they<br>  May move thee, then have pity on thy wife,<br>  So worn, so dolour-stricken.  For her sake<br>  Come where she may have comfort.  On the morn<br>  We celebrate a wedding in our hall;<br>  Joyance and cheer and chime of marriage-bell<br>  Will make the world grow winsomer to you both."<br>  <br>  But Enid, when she heard him, called to mind<br>  The young dead lovers lying in the glade,<br>  And understood and grieving told him all.<br>  And King Guivret wept bitterly and he said:<br>  "Cadoc of Tabriol, my sister's son,<br>  Just issued from his squireship!  Brave and true,<br>  A good knight he had proved.  And sweet Yglais,<br>  His bride that should have been--so young and fair!<br>  And they are dead!  The wedding-wine is mulled,<br>  The hall is strown for bridals.  They are dead!<br>  And we must toll the bells to other tune.<br>  And yet, my lady and my lord Geraint,<br>  Though mourning fills our chambers, will ye come<br>  And find repose and healing for your hurts?"<br>  "Fair friend," replied Geraint, "we thank thee; yea."<br>  <br>  Then caused the king two litters to be made<br>  Of tree-boughs, covered with soft grass and silks,<br>  And on the one placed Enid, and Geraint<br>  Upon the other.  And the morning-grey<br>  Revealed to them the castle by the stream,<br>  High-towered Pen&eacute;vric, where in robes right rich<br>  And all of luxury, they lodged full well;<br>  And where the sisters, skilled in surgery,<br>  Used every art to cure the prince's wounds.<br>  <br>  And such was their unfailing craft and care,<br>  That when a month was ended, strong and well<br>  And vigorous of manhood was Geraint.<br>  Then joy returned to Enid, and with joy<br>  Rose-red of cheek, and golden sheen of hair,<br>  And in her eyes the shining of a light.<br>  And happiness gave to her such a grace,<br>  So wonder-working and so excellent<br>  That where she was there all was beautiful--<br>  Ay, that which had been never; and all men,<br>  Beholding her fair nobleness and charm,<br>  Were minded to gaze long, lest when she pass<br>  All beauteousness go with her.  And Geraint<br>  Had in his heart a love past any speech.<br>  <br>  But naught of traitor was there in this love,<br>  As had been in the old.  From this should spring<br>  Not slothfulness, dishonourable ease,<br>  Indifference to his duties as a prince,<br>  A people's disaffection, the dark slime<br>  Of slanders that ere long must change to truths,<br>  But action, honour on the field of arms,<br>  Fair duties fairly done, all knightlihood,<br>  A people's reverence for a worthy lord,<br>  And wide, yet wider fame.  For in those days<br>  Of health restored, when Enid and Geraint<br>  Re-entered into that companionship<br>  And unison of spirit which they prized<br>  Above all other good, and which had been<br>  So long denied them by their own distrust,<br>  Misunderstandings, doubts and unshared griefs,<br>  Then frankly each to other told a tale:<br>  Enid, of her unwillingness to speak<br>  And tell him how the people scoffed at him<br>  As given up to luxury, and content;<br>  Geraint, of his ignoble doubts of her,<br>  Of how the evil words of Honolan<br>  Had closed with hers so fatefully on that morn.<br>  And then he said:  "Yet, Enid, all the while<br>  I knew that he had lied; and all the while<br>  It was upon me I should cast me down<br>  And cry forgiveness that I wronged thee so;<br>  But such a storm of wrath and shame and pride<br>  Possessed me that all gentlehood was stilled.<br>  And, Enid, what a poor thing was my pride!<br>  My pride, which took no reck of periling thee!<br>  My pride, wherein was neither reasoning<br>  Nor courtesy nor any knightliness!<br>  It was my master; yet at best it was <br>  Only the wilful passion of a child!<br>  And well-nigh it brought ruin to us both."<br>  <br>  But Enid, looking on him with clear eyes<br>  A little grave with tenderness, replied:<br>  "O knight of mine, the past is past indeed.<br>  The Mansions of To-morrow are so fair!<br>  Therein shall we dwell always, with us, Love,<br>  Kinglier-souled that he is learn'd of Pain.<br>  True lover and true knight, I love thee well!"<br>  <br>  So with Guivret the Little they abode<br>  A fortnight and a month, and found him frank<br>  And ever faultless in his courtesy.<br>  But then they fell to longing for their home,<br>  The pleasant land of Devon, where should be<br>  A life the fairer for the lifted woe,<br>  A love the greater that it had been tried,<br>  Proved in the furnace-fires of stress and strife.<br>  Wherefore they spake their purpose to Guivret;<br>  And though for his own sake he much desired<br>  Their tarriance still, of five score knights he formed<br>  A retinue befitting, and with such train<br>  Geraint and Enid rode to their own realm.<br>  <br>  And heart-deep was the welcome which they had<br>  From Erbin who had feared that they were dead,<br>  And when they came before him, wept with joy.<br>  And wide rejoicing made he in his court.<br>  Then, though at Enid's gentle word, Geraint<br>  Spared to Sir Honolan his evil life,<br>  He banished him to shores beyond the seas.<br>  <br>  And in the years that followed all was well.<br>  Never did Prince Geraint again decline<br>  To aught that was unworthy; steadfast, brave,<br>  Tireless in quest of honour, a true knight<br>  He was in all ways knightly, and the tongues<br>  Which once had scoffed, spake nothing but his praise,<br>  And praise of her with whom he had such love,<br>  Enid, so very fair and very leal.<br>  And when the good King Erbin was no more,<br>  Unto Geraint and Enid passed the crown<br>  Of Devon, and a king and queen were they,<br>  To Arthur tributary, but paramount<br>  In their own land.  And king and queen they lived<br>  And loved, until transformed to deathless names.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AFTERWORD<br>  <br>  So hath the fair old history an end.<br>  And yet, I pray you, gentles, linger still<br>  And hear the song which folk say Alarin<br>  Made when he dwelt in Faerie.  For of him,<br>  The story goes that Enid and Geraint<br>  Had been in Devon at King Erbin's call<br>  Hardly a twelvemonth, when from Arthur's court<br>  He went away, and no man saw him more;<br>  And wise folk say he sought, and seeking found,<br>  The Country of the Clearness, Faeryland.<br>  <br>  And the chief harper to the faery-king<br>  He was, and ware the potent crown of joy;<br>  Beheld the walls of beryl and the towers<br>  Of amethyst and loadstone, heard the plash<br>  Of waters Avalonian where the cups<br>  Of lilies mould a margin to their flow,<br>  And saw the stars wet with the faery sea.<br>  <br>  And yet he made a small song, even this:<br>  <br>  "Here, to suspended music, the slow hours<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Turn neither east nor west their golden ball;<br>  And here, by wind-blown fountains, are the flowers<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which never fall.<br>  <br>  "Ah, but what profit of the sovran day?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;What profit of this immortality,<br>  If still remembrance and its fret must fray<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unceasingly?<br>  <br>  "Here is the light whose sumless levels foam<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Like billows crescent to a crystal strand--<br>  Serenities celestial--and they dome<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A changeless land.<br>  <br>  "Ah, but what comfort in such clarity?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;What soul in such placidity of grace?--<br>  Ah, but the light which never lived for me<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon <i> her</i>  face!"
