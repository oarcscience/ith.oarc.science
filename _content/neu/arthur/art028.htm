Sure thou art<br>  The only flower of Eden left to bloom<br>  Amid the thorny thistles of real life, <br>  Scenting the wayside with thy rich perfume, <br>  Brightening with beauty common spots of earth! <br>  "Alas!" said Balin, looking on the pair,<br>  "Sorely repent I now this brave knight's death, <br>  Because of her who loved him living so! <br>  And yet methinks 'twere happiness to die, <br>  In armor clad, doing one's right devoir, <br>  With one we love to breathe their last, warm sigh<br>  In sorrow out, surviving not our loss!" <br>  While thus he mused aloud, on horseback came, <br>  Riding apace, a dwarf from Camelot, <br>  That wildly grieved above the lifeless twain. <br>  Quoth good Sir Balin, "'Twas a sorry deed; <br>  And yet himself gave challenge for the tilt! <br>  No craven heart is mine to fly from foe, <br>  And fate had will'd that one should linger here. <br>  The damsel died for love of yon still knight, <br>  And evermore I hold, for her sweet sake, <br>  All womankind in highest, dear esteem!" <br>  As thus they talk'd, King Mark of Cornwall rode<br>  On gallant charger by the touching group, <br>  And sorrow'd greatly for such true hearts dead, <br>  Swearing with vows he would not stir from thence<br>  Till he had raised above their dust a tomb. <br>  Then, pitching his pavilion on the spot, <br>  His squires sought through all the country round<br>  To find a sepulchre would shrine them both; <br>  And ere Sir Balin took his parting leave<br>  Of Cornwall's generous sovereign, he had reared, <br>  A monument right passing rich and fair, <br>  Brought from some distant church, and rarely carved<br>  And sculptured on the stone their name and fate:-- <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here lieth Lanceor, a valiant knight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Arthur's friend, and son of Ireland's king,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill'd by Sir Balin of the Table Round,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lawful tilt upon the green hill-side;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on his breast the ladye of his love<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleepeth till judgment, slain by her own hand,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For very sorrow, with her lover's sword!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray for the souls, O gentle passer-by,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fair Colombe and brave Sir Lanceor!"  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>
