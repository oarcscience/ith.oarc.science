I looked again--<br>    And man and dog were gone,<br>    Like wisps of the graying dawn. . . .<br> <br> Were they a part of the grim death there--<br>    Ragweed, fennel, and rue?<br> Or forms of the mind, an old despair,<br>    That there into semblance grew<br>    Out of the grief I knew?<br> 
<p>  <hr>  NOTE: In a letter to the editor printed in the <i> Times Literary Supplement</i>  (8 Dec. 1995, p. 14), Robert Ian Scott suggests that "the many similarities between this poem" and T. S. Eliot's "The Waste Land" "can hardly be coincidental."  Scott notes that Eliot "had reasons to be reading" the Jan. 1913 issue of <i> Poetry</i>  in which Cawein's poem appeared because it contained Pound's article on the poets then in London (though Eliot himself is not referred to in the article).
