Thus said<br>  The sweet Sir Sagramour and added thence:<br>  "Thy face, Sir Lamoracke, is not unknown<br>  To me."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then slowly Lamoracke answer'd him:<br>  "O all for naught my quest and not for one<br>  Like me the vision glorious, but thou,<br>  Methinks, for knightly courtesy the peer<br>  Of any at the court, might well have seen<br>  What I, the son of Pellinore, have not."<br>  <br>  "Not I," then spoke the sweet Sir Sagramour,<br>  "Being ensnar'd with earthly things unto<br>  My hurt, but an' I pray you, Lamoracke, ride.<br>  My castle scarce a half league distant stands,<br>  There mayst thou rest, at least until the morn,<br>  And ride to court equipt as knight should be<br>  So far as my poor store shall serve thy turn."<br>  <br>  Then Lamoracke lookt up and answer'd him,<br>  "Ah, sweet Sir Sagramour, none other suit<br>  Suits with my sadden'd fortunes like to this<br>  Which now I wear and therefore in array<br>  Like this must I before King Arthur pass<br>  Once more."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answer made Sir Sagramour:<br>  "Thou knowest best, but still I pray you ride<br>  Homeward with me and eat and rest a night;<br>  Else thou wilt never live to see thy lord<br>  At all, in this or any other garb."<br>  Full gentle was the manner of the man,<br>  And Lamoracke for utter weariness<br>  Gave way and past with sweet Sir Sagramour<br>  Unto the other's castle near at hand,<br>  Yet thinking, "on the morrow I will go."<br>  As one who following the chase for days<br>  Scarce heeds his wearied limbs because so full<br>  Of eager haste but home returning finds<br>  Each step a pain and life a mockery,<br>  So now with Lamoracke, who, with the fire<br>  Of zeal and holy purpose quite burnt out,<br>  Tarried for days with sweet Sir Sagramour,<br>  Too weak for further travel and heart-sick<br>  Withal because of failure in the Quest.<br>  To him in those dark days came Sagramour<br>  And whisper'd, "Courage; failure is not a crime."<br>  And after came the wife of Sagramour<br>  Beseeching him to be of cheer, to whom<br>  He heark'n'd listlessly.  Then came a child<br>  The son of these, a three-years winsome lad<br>  Who stammer'd "Courage" as he had been taught,<br>  And seeing that Sir Lamoracke took no heed<br>  Stammer'd his lesson o'er again, whereat<br>  The knight, half rising on his elbow, turn'd<br>  And saw the boy with parted lips, and cheeks<br>  All satin soft, and hair and eyes the hue<br>  Of sable pansies, staring full at him;<br>  Then Lamoracke rose and caught the lad in arms<br>  And kiss'd him oft and spoke full tenderly:<br>  "Thou bidd'st me be of courage, little one?<br>  Yea, for thy sake I will," and from that time<br>  Shook off, as far as might be, sad regret.<br>  <br>  Yet still strength linger'd on its way to him,<br>  And with these a sennight longer bode,<br>  And after rose refresh'd and went his way.<br>  But ere that time he told to please his host<br>  Full many a tale of what had hapt to him<br>  In Quest of Holy Grail and once the tale<br>  Ran like to this.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One morning after dreams,"<br>  So said Sir Lamoracke, "of Holy Grail<br>  Seen by me who unworthy am to see<br>  With waking eyes, I past, for then was I<br>  In Cornwall by the sea, along a road<br>  That wound past splinter'd crag and shallow cove<br>  To fishing village of Saint Ives.  Seaward<br>  Saint Michael's Mount rose like a vision fair<br>  All roseate with dawn and softly broke<br>  Against its base the Cornish sea.  A light<br>  Breeze blew that gently stirr'd the leaves and then<br>  Rested content while overhead a flock<br>  Of birds shrill'd one to other, flying south<br>  The sound clear falling thro' the morning air.<br>  The weather-beaten fishers mended nets<br>  Sitting on boats updrawn beside the sea<br>  And hail'd me with 'good-morrow' as I past,<br>  In simple fisher wise.  Suddenly round<br>  An angle in the path before me came<br>  Full seven fisher-wives bending beneath<br>  A heavy burden each one bore in sack<br>  Of dusty leather on her shoulders old.<br>  Small trace had these of brow may-blossom, cheek<br>  Of apple blossom or the eye of hawk,<br>  And clumsily the wrinkl'd nose of each,<br>  Tip-tilted, like a thirsty duckling's bill<br>  After much guzzling in the pool, did seem<br>  To point the way.  A wailing clamor rose<br>  In air and louder grew as nearer came<br>  The seven, halting where I stood aside<br>  To let them pass, and lowering their sacks<br>  Upon the ground.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In much amaze I ask'd<br>  The seven what their burden was, whereat<br>  The nearest shrilly pip'd forth:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cats, sir knight,<br>  To rid the palace of King Mark of rats<br>  That fright the fair Iseult, his Queen."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this<br>  Each wrinkl'd dame her knotted sack-string loost<br>  And forth from out the seven sacks there stalk'd<br>  With pace sedate, and slowly waving tails,<br>  And deep-ton'd purings of well-fed content,<br>  Full seven times seven cats and every one<br>  The mother proud of seven kittens small<br>  That sprawl'd and mew'd beside the sacks.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such sight<br>  I never saw in Camelot, altho'<br>  Our Camelot is vaster than Saint Ives<br>  And cats enow contains, as one may deem<br>  Who finds his slumber broken by their wails<br>  On roof and tow'r from midnight till the dawn,<br>  And long I star'd at sprawling kits, and cats,<br>  And sacks, and wives, until within the sacks<br>  The seven wives replaced the cats and kits<br>  And journey'd forward, wives, and sacks, and cats,<br>  And kits, while I with musings curious<br>  Past onward to Saint Ives."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A sight indeed,"<br>  Here spoke Sir Sagramour, "and speedily<br>  The burden of the seven wives should clear<br>  The Cornish castle of its brood of rats<br>  Save one, its churlish lord, for fouler rat<br>  Than Mark, the craven, lives not upon earth."<br>  <br>  To whom Sir Lamoracke:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True, Sir Sagramour,<br>  But tell me of thy wit, which passes mine,<br>  How many, reck'nest thou, to fair Saint Ives<br>  Were going on that morning, kits, and cats,<br>  And sacks, and wives."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweet Sir Sagramour<br>  Knit brows, and tighten'd lips, and fingers told<br>  The space of three long hours till fell the sun<br>  And creeping darkness came upon the land,<br>  And still no nearer was he to result<br>  Than he had been at first when Lamoracke put<br>  The question, nor with morning was it clear,<br>  And with the morning Lamoracke went his way.<br>
