## SIR FLORIS

### by

## JOHN PAYNE

  
  
THE ROMAUNT OF SIR FLORIS  
  
*In this sweet world and fair to see,  
          There is full many a mystery,  
       That toil and misery have wrought  
       To banish from the sight and thought  
    Of striving men in this our air  
    Of pain and doubt, and many a fair  
Sweet wonder that doth live and move  
Within the channel of Christ's love.  
    And of these, truly, aforetime  
    Was made full many a tender rhyme  
And lay of wonder and delight;  
And by full many a noble knight  
    And minstrel was the story told,  
    With the sweet simple faith of old,  
Of how the questing was fulfill'd  
Of that Sangreal that was will'd  
    By the dear God to Galahad,  
    And how by many a one was had  
Rare venture in the holy Quest,  
Albeit very few were blest  
    With comfort in the sight of it;  
    And by that menestrel, to wit,  
(Oh sweetest of all bards to me  
And worthiest to Master be  
   Of all that sing of Christ His knight  
   And Questing of the Grail!) that hight  
Of Eschenbach, that tale was writ  
Of Percivale, that now doth sit  
   Within the bosom of the Lord,  
    And how he strove with spear and sword  
Full many a year for Christ His grace.  
And with delight of those old lays,  
   There long has murmur'd in my brain  
   A song that often and again  
Has cried to me for utterance;  
And now---before the sad years chance  
   To bear all thought of holiness  
   From men with mirk of pain and stress  
Of toil---it wearies me to tell  
Of all that unto Floris fell,  
   And all his toil and all his bliss  
   And grace in winning to Christ's kiss.  
Wherefore, I pray you, hearkneth  
The while with scant and feeble breath  
   I tell to you a quaint old tale,  
   Wherein is neither sin nor bale,  
But some sweet peace and sanctity:  
And there not only wonders be,  
   But therewithal a breath of love  
   Is woven round it and above,  
That lovers in the Summer-prime  
May clasp warm hands o'er this my rhyme,  
   As finding there some golden sense  
   Of Love's delicious recompense:  
For what withouten love is life?  
And if therein is any strife,  
   Or therewithal offences be,  
   I pray you pardon it to me:  
Wherefore, Christ hearten you, I say,  
Et Dieu vous doint felicité.*  
  
I. THE FIRST COMING OF THE DOVE.  
  
Hard by the confluence of Rhone  
A castle of old times alone  
   Upon a high grey hill did stand,  
   And look'd across the pleasant land:  
And of the castle castellain  
And lord of all the wide domain  
   Of golden field and purple wood  
   And vineyards where the vine-rows stood  
In many a trellis, Floris was;  
A good knight and a valorous,  
   And in all courtesies approved,  
   That unto valiantise behoved.  
Full young he was and fair of face,  
And among ladies had much grace,  
   And favour of all men likewise:  
   For in such stout and valiant guise  
His years of manhood had he spent  
In knightly quest and tournament,  
   There was no knight in all the land  
   Whose name in more renown did stand,  
And the foe quaked to look upon  
The white plume of his morion,  
   When through the grinding shock of spears  
   Sir Floris' war-cry pierced their ears  
And over all the din was blown  
The silver of his clarion.  
  
   So was much ease prepared for him,  
   And safety from the need and grim  
Hard battle against gibe and sneer  
That must full oft be foughten here--  
   For evil fortune and the lack  
   Of strength to thrust the envious back--  
By many a noble soul and true;  
And had he chosen to ensue  
   The well-worn path that many tread  
   For worship, all his life were spread  
Before him, level with delight.  
But if in shock of arms and fight  
   Of squadrons he disdainèd not  
   To win renown, the silken lot  
Of those that pass their days in ease  
And dalliance on the flower'd leas  
   Of life was hateful to his soul;  
   And so--when once the battle's roll  
And thunder was from off the lands  
Turn'd back and from the war-worn hands  
   The weapons fell--he could not bring  
   His heart to brook the wearying  
Of peace and indolent disport  
Of ease. Wherefore he left the court--  
   So secretly that no one knew  
   Awhile his absence--and withdrew  
A season to his own demesne,  
And there in solitude was fain  
   To yearn for some fair chance to hap  
   And win his living from the lap  
Of drowsy idlesse with some quest,  
That should from that unlovely rest  
   Redeem him to the old delight  
   Of plucking--in the bold despite  
Of danger--from the brows of Fate  
Some laurel. Nor had he to wait  
   The cooling of his knightly fire;  
   There was vouchsafed to his desire,  
Ere long, a very parlous quest,  
That should unto the utterest  
Assay his knightly worth and test  
   The temper of his soul full well  
   And sore. And in this wise it fell.  
  
It chanced one night,--most nigh the time  
When through the mist-wreaths and the rime  
   The hours begin to draw toward  
   The enchanted birthnight of the Lord,--  
That in the midnight, on his bed,  
He heard in dreams, a voice that said  
   "Arise, Sir Floris, get thee forth,  
   An thou wouldst prove thee knight of worth!"  
Gross slumbers of the middle night  
So held and clipp'd the valiant knight,  
   He might him not to speak address  
   For slumber and for heaviness.  
  
Again it rang out loud and clear,  
So that might not choose but hear,  
And in his heart he quaked for fear;  
   But still he lay and answer'd not,  
   Such hold had sleep upon him got.  
  
A third time through the chamber past  
The voice, as 'twere a trumpet's blast:  
   "Arise, Sir Floris, harness thee,  
   For love of Christ that died on tree!"  
  
He started up from sleep for fear  
And groped to find a sword or spear,  
Thinking some enemy was near;  
   But of no creature was he ware.  
   He saw the moon hang in the air--  
As 'twere a cup of lucent pearl--  
And in the distance heard the swirl  
   Of waters through the silence run;  
   But other sight or sound was none.  
  
The moon's light lay across the night  
In one great stream of silver-white,  
   And folded round the Christ that stood  
   At bedhead, carven in black wood;  
And Floris, looking on the way  
Of light that through the chamber lay,  
   Was ware of a strange blossoming--  
   As of some birth of holy thing--  
That in the bar of silver stirr'd;  
And as he gazed, a snow-white bird  
   Grew slowly into perfect shape,  
   As if some virtue did escape  
From that strange silver prisonhouse  
Into the city perilous  
   Of life, and for its safety's sake  
   The likeness of a fowl did take.  
The light seem'd loth to let it go  
Into this world of sin and woe  
   (So pure and holy) and put out  
   Long arms of white the dove about,  
As if to net it safely in:  
But, as the holy bird did win  
   It way and through the meshes rent,  
   The rays of light together blent  
And fell into a cross of white,  
Whereon the silver dove did light  
   Above the image benedight.  
  
   Sir Floris wonder'd at the sight,  
And looking on the cross, he deem'd  
That from the Christ a glory gleam'd  
   And lay in gold towards the door;  
   And something bade him go before.  
  
He rose and girt himself upon  
With helm and with habergeon,  
   And in his hand his sword full bright  
   He bore, that Fleurdeluceaunt hight.  
  
The dove flew out into the air,  
And Floris follow'd through the bare  
   Dumb ways and chambers to the gate,  
   Whose open leaves for them did wait,  
And as into the night they past,  
Together were behind them cast.  
  
   The night was dumb, the moon did glower  
   Upon them, like a pale sick flower  
That in the early chill of spring  
Mocks at the summer's blossoming,  
   And over every hill and stowe  
   The ways were white and sad with snow.  
  
So pass'd he, with the silver dove  
That went before him and above,  
   Within the sheeny moonés light--  
   Wherewith her outspread plumes were dight  
So that it seem'd each wing became  
And grew into a silver flame--  
   Until the hollow'd snow was track'd  
   Into a woodway, where there lack'd  
The moonlight, and the mountain-side  
With drooping ash and linden vied  
   To keep the hollow place from ray  
   Or glimmer of the silver-play.  
  
The dove flew in, and, following,  
Sir Floris heard a muffled ring  
   Of silver in the mountain's womb,  
   As if dead music there had tomb.  
Here the dove folded wings and smote  
The part wherefrom the sound did float.  
  
   The mountain open'd, and they went,  
   By force of some strange wonderment,  
   Into a place of flowers, all sprent  
With jewels of the blossom-time;  
And all the air was sweet with rhyme:  
There reign'd an endless summer-prime.  
   Tall green was there of leaféd trees,  
   And in the blossom'd walks the breeze  
Was music, such as winds and plays  
About the May-sweet woodland ways,  
   When spring is fresh and hope is clear;  
   And in the place where leaves are sere  
On earth, there lay great heaps of gold,  
Yweft my wonderment untold  
   To semblance of the Autumn's waste,  
   Through which the sweet wind play'd and chased  
Its frolic breaths with perfume laden.  
  
In grass stood many a white maiden  
   That lily in the outworld hight;  
   And roses all the herbage dight.  
Bright plaited beds of jewel-flowers  
Were thick-set in the garden bowers,  
   And many a row of sunflowers stood  
   Along the marges of the wood,  
And to the sapphire heaven turn'd,  
As if towards the sun they burn'd.  
   About the blossoms, round and over,  
   Strange golden-crested birds did hover  
That flash'd and sparkled like a flight  
Of wingèd starlets in the night;  
   And, as they went, their pinions beat  
   The air of that serene retreat  
To rush and sweep of magic song,  
And through the trees was sweet and strong  
   The trill of lark and nightingale.  
   There was not any note of wail  
In song of birds or sweep of wind,  
Such as in woodlands calls to mind  
   The last year's winter and the next,  
   Wherewith the listener's soul is vext  
And thinks how short the spring will be,  
And how the flower-times change and flee  
   Towards the dreary month of snows.  
   The full glad passion of the rose  
Was joyous in the garden air,  
And every sight and sound was fair  
   With unalloy'd contentedness.  
   There could not enter any stress  
Of labour or of worldly woe;  
But ever through the place did flow  
   A silver sound of singing winds,  
   A breath of jasmine and woodbinds,  
As if all joy were gather'd there  
And prison'd in the golden air.  
  
   And as Sir Floris wonderèd  
   At those sweet flow'rets white and red,  
And at the stream's sweet song that set  
The garden-breezes all afret  
   With breaking waves of melody,  
   And at the bird's sweet minstrelsy,--  
There came to him a damozel  
(How fair she was no man can tell),  
And said, "Fair knight, now wit thou well  
   That thou hast gather'd great renown  
   In that sad world where trees are brown  
And ways are white in winter-time,  
And hast in many a maker's rhyme  
   Been celebrate for gentilesse  
   And valiant doings in the press  
Of armèd knights and battle-play,  
In tournament and in mellay;  
   And over all the land is known  
   How, many a time, thy horn has blown  
To succour maidens in distress,  
And oftentimes have had redress  
   The needy by thy stroke of sword.  
   So that to him, that is the lord  
Of this fair place, the fame has won  
Of all that thou hast dared and done  
   In perfectness of chivalry;  
   And he, who uses well to see  
Great deeds of arms and shock of spears,  
Has seen no one in all these years  
   That may be chosen for thy peer;  
   And therefore has he brought thee here,  
To try thee if thou canst endure  
Battle and venture, forte et dure  
   Beyond the wont of men on earth;  
   Wherein if thou canst prove thy worth,  
He will advance thee to his grace  
And set thee surely in high place  
   Among his knights."  
  
                              "Fair damozel,"  
   Said Floris, "liketh me full well  
The quest, by what you say of it:  
But now, I pray you, let me wit  
   Who is this lord, whose hest you bear,  
   That is so high and debonair?  
And what adventure must I prove  
Before that I can win his love?"  
   And she, "His name I may not tell;  
   Hereafter shalt thou know it well;  
But thou shalt see his presently."  
  
   Then did she join her bended palms,  
And falling down upon her knee  
   Among the knitted herbs and haulms,  
Did softly sing a full sweet rhyme;  
And in a little space of time  
   Was visible among the treen--  
   Against a trellised work of green  
That at the garden's farthest end  
Among the leaves did twine and blend--  
   A man, that walk'd among the flowers  
   As softly as the evening hours  
Walk in the summer-haunted treen.  
Full tall and stately was his mien,  
   And down his back the long hair lay,  
   Red-gold as is the early day,  
Whereon a crown of light was set.  
Whoever saw might ne'er forget.  
   The sweetness of his majesty.  
   But in no wise could Floris see  
Or win to look upon his face;  
For, as he went, he turn'd aside  
   His visage, as it were to hide  
The light of its unearthly grace  
   From mortal eyes.  
  
                              Then Floris said,  
"I pray thee of thy kindlihead,  
   Fair maid, that I may come to look  
   On this lord's visage." But she shook  
Her head, and "Patience!" did she say.  
"Thou must in fear and much affray  
   For this fair place, and for the fame  
   Of him that master of the same  
And sovereign is, be purged and tried,  
And through much venture must abide,  
   Ere thou mayst look upon his face  
   And win the guerdon of his grace,  
And now the time is come to prove  
Battle and hardship for his love.  
   Adieu, sir knight: be bold and true!"  
  
   Whereat she sped beyond his view,  
And eke that figure vanishèd;  
But Floris, lifting up his head,  
   Was ware of a strange hand that bare  
   A cross and stood in middle air,  
And on the white plume of his crest  
Did for a moment lie and rest.  
   Therewith great ease was given him,  
   And healing freedom from all dim  
Sad doubts of fortune and of fate  
In that great strife, that did await  
   His proving; and the strength of men  
   In him was as the strength of ten  
Redoubled. Then he saw, beside  
His feet, a flower-bed fair and wide  
   Of roses mingled red and white,  
   Full sweet of smell and fair of sight,  
That in a trellised red-gold grate  
Did hold a sweet and lovely state  
   And spread around such wealth of balm,  
   Their scent seem'd one great golden psalm  
Of perfume to the praise of God.  
  
Then Floris knelt upon the sod  
   Of that fair place, and praying thrice  
   Most heartily, did take advice  
That up the silver-spangled grail--  
That through the green did twine and trail  
   Of that bright garden's goodliness--  
   Some gruesome thing towards him did press.  
As 'twere the roses to despoil.  
So sprang he lightly from the soil,  
   And from its scabbard iron-blue  
   His falchion Fleurdeluceaunt drew,  
And kiss'd its fair hilt cruciform;  
Wherewith his heart wax'd bold and warm  
   With courage past the use of men.  
  
   Now was a loathly thing, I ween,  
Made visible to him--that might  
Well strike the boldest with affright.  
   For up the sward to him did run  
   A beast yet never saw the sun;  
As 'twere a dog with double head,  
Whose hinder parts were fashionèd  
   Into the likeness of a worm.  
   Full black and grisly was his form,  
And blazing red his eyes and tongue  
With raging choler, such as stung  
   His lusting heart to rob and tear  
   The flowers that in the garden were.  
But as he came anigh the place  
Wherein those roses all did grace  
   The greensward, to his troubled sight  
   Was visible that valiant knight,  
That in whole armour of blue steel  
Before the flowery shrine did kneel,  
   To save the emblems of Love's joy  
   From his most foul and rude annoy.  
Wherefore at him with open mouth  
The monster ran, as 'twere its drouth  
   And ravening lust to wreak and slake  
   Upon the knight. Then did he take  
His sword, and with so stout a blow  
Upon the beast's twin neck did throw  
   The edge, that with the dolorous stroke  
   The thread of its foul life he broke  
In twain, and from the sunder'd veins  
The black blood strew'd with loathly stains  
   The tender grass and herbs therein;  
   And as among the flower-stalks thin  
The hideous purple gore was sprent,  
From out the stain (O wonderment  
   And grace of Mary merciful!)  
   There open'd out the petals full  
And lovesome of that snowy bloom  
That is in all earth's sin and gloom  
   The fairest of all flowers to see,  
   The lily of white chastity.  
  
Right glad was Floris of the sight,  
And of the scent that from the white  
   Gold-hearted bells to him was lent;  
   And as he o'er the calyx bent  
To breathe its fragrance, suddenly  
There came a sound across the lea,  
   That was as if a lion roar'd;  
   And truly o'er the blossom'd sward  
There ran to him a tawny beast,  
Red-maned, that never stay'd nor ceased  
   To roar, until the knight could feel  
   His hot breath through the grated steel  
That barr'd his vizor, and his claws  
Sought grimly for some joint or pause  
   In the hard mail, where he might set  
   His tusks and through the rent veins let  
The knight's life-blook upon the sward.  
But Floris, lifting up his sword,  
   Him with such doughty strokes oppress'd  
   Upon his red and haughty crest,  
That soon he made him loose his hold;  
And in a while, no longer bold  
   And arrogant, he would have fled,  
   But that Sir Floris on his head  
With the sharp edge smote such a blow,  
The red blood from the rift did flow,  
   And with the blood the life did pass:  
   Wherefore from out the bloodied grass  
There was uplift the rose of love,  
With scent and blossom fair enough,  
   I trow, to guerdon many a toil  
   And many a battle in the coil  
Of earthly woes.  
  
                              But there was yet  
No time for Floris to forget  
   His trouble in the red flower's sight:  
   He must again in deathly fight  
Be join'd for the security  
Of that fair garden's purity.  
   For swiftly in the lion's place  
   A raging leopard came, the grace  
Of those sweet roses to despoil;  
And as he came, the very soil  
   Quaked underneath him, such a might  
   To wreak his cholerick despite  
'Gainst him that was the sovereign  
Of that fair place, and such disdain  
   Did rage in him, that he could see  
   No thing for anger. So was he  
Against the roses well nigh come,  
Nay, was in act to spoil their bloom,  
   When through his heart the deadly blade  
   Slid cold; and turning round, he made  
At Floris with a vengeful roar,  
And with his claws his thigh he tore  
   A hand's-breadth in his agony.  
   Then down upon the grass fell he  
And died; and in the tender sward,  
Whereon his felon blood was pour'd,  
   The sign of humbleness was set,  
   The flower that men call violet.  
  
Full faint was Floris with the loss  
Of blood, that from the wound across  
   His thigh did run in many a rill,  
   And would have fain awhile been still  
Without reproof. But no repose  
Must he expect (nor one of those  
   That in God's battle fight on earth)  
   Nor pleasance of delight and mirth,  
But many a dint and many a blow  
Unceasing, till God will his woe  
   Be ended and the goal be won.  
  
   And so, as there he sat, anon,  
Whilst wearily he look'd along  
The fair wide path, he saw the long  
   Slow travel of a hideous snake,  
   That with much toil its way did make  
   Towards the roses where he stood.  
   So faint he was with failing blood,  
He might not summon any strength  
To smite its black and gruesome length  
   At vantage, crawling, but must wait  
   Until, with slow and tortuous gait,  
It won to him. So weak he was,  
He could not choose but let it pass  
   Towards the trellis; and eftsoon,  
   By him that lay in some half swoon,  
Across the grass it slid and twined  
Around the grating that confined  
   The flowers, its black and hideous length,  
   And breathed on them with all the strength  
Of hate its envying soul could know  
To gather in a breath, and so  
   To spoil their fresh and goodly bloom:  
   Whereat the blossoms with the gloom  
Of its black coils, that shut the light  
From over them, and with affright  
   And sickness of its loathsome breath,  
   Came very nigh to take their death.  
For with such potent spells the air  
Its venom darken'd of despair  
   And malice, that the lovely red  
   And white of their bright goodlihead  
Was to a sickly pallor turn'd,  
As if some loathly fever burn'd  
   Within their hearts: and in a while  
   No kiss of breeze or golden smile  
Of sun had won them back to life,  
So spent were they with the fell strife  
   Of that curs'd beast,--had not a sweep  
   Of wings awaken'd from the sleep  
Of pain Sir Floris, and the scream  
Of a great bird, whose plumes did seem  
   To brush his forehead, roused his sense  
   From the constraint of indolence.  
  
Then sprang he up in strength renew'd;  
And when he saw the serpent lewd  
   And hideous, that in his embrace  
   Did strangle all the life and grace  
From out the flowers, he made at him  
And with a grip so fierce and grim  
   Oppres'd his scaly swollen neck,  
   That with the dolour and the check  
Of blood within his venom'd veins,  
The snake must needs relax the chains  
   In which he held the rosery;  
   And in the act so mightily  
Had leapt at Floris, that he wound  
His arms and body closely round  
   With scaly rings, and so uneath  
   Did grip the knight, that little breath  
Seem'd in his body to be left;  
But, summoning all strength, he reft  
   The horrid fetters from his breast,  
   And flung the worm with utterest  
His might full length against the ground.  
  
There whiles it lay in seeming swound;  
   And Floris, thinking it was dead,  
   Would have lain down his weary head  
Upon the grass, to take some ease  
Awhile. Then from among the trees  
   There came that fowl, that had awoke  
   Him with its passing pinions' stroke,  
And with so hard a buffet drove  
Him down to earth, he could nor move  
   Nor speak awhile, but lay as dead:  
   And that foul bird, with eyes of red  
And vulture claws, did strive the while  
At every joint and crack of mail  
   To wound him with its noisome beak.  
   At last a place it found where weak  
The armour was, and with such spite  
Into Sir Floris' flesh did bite,  
   That for the fierceness of the pain  
   He started up from sleep again  
And with so fierce and stout a blow  
The vulture strake, the steel did go  
   Athwart the pinions and the crest,  
   And riving down the armour'd breast,  
Did hew the gruesome snake in twain,  
In whom the life began again  
   To flutter. So the loathly two  
   With that stroke died; and with the dew  
Of their foul blood, the lovely green  
Of the fair sward did such a spleen  
   And hate of its despiteous hue  
   Conceive, that quickly sprang to view  
A twine of slow-white clematis,  
The sign of sweet content that is;  
   And where the bird in death was cold,  
   There grew the glad bright marigold,  
That in its gay and golden dress  
Was ever symbol of largesse,  
   Since all along the meads there run  
   Its mimic mirrors of the sun,  
Withouten any speck or flaw.  
  
But none of this Sir Floris saw,  
   Nor how the roses lightly wore  
   The freshness of their bloom once more;  
So weary was he and so worn  
With strife, and therewithal so torn  
   With claws and beak of that fierce bird,  
   He lay aswoon and saw nor heard  
Or sight or sound.  
  
                              Now must I tell  
A wondrous thing that here befell,  
   Through grace of God and Christ, His Son:  
   For, while he lay aswoon, came one  
In white and shining robes array'd,  
And touch'd him on the lips and said,  
   "Arise, Sir Floris, whole of wound,  
And fill thy quest!" And so was gone.  
   And Floris started up from ground,  
And was all whole in flesh and bone  
   And full of heart the end to dare  
   Of that hard venture.  
  
                              Then the air  
Was of a sudden darken'd o'er  
With some foul thing, that semblance wore  
   Of a half bird, and a half worm,  
   Join'd in one foul and loathly form;  
And with the rattle of the scales  
Upon its wings--that (as huge flails  
   Upon the golden garnered wheat  
   With ceaseless rhythmic pulse do beat)  
Did lash and wound the golden air--  
The songs of breezes deadn'd were,  
   And all was dumb for much dismay:  
   And with its sight the lift grew gray.  
And as it wheel'd on open wings,  
With many blows and buffetings  
   It strove to daunt that valiant knight  
   And enforce him for sheer affright  
To yield to it and let it fill  
Its hungry maw at its foul will  
   With those fair flowers. But Floris stood  
   Undaunted, and with many a good  
Stout stroke of point did wound the beast,  
Werewith it bled and much increased  
   Its ravenous rage. Then, suddenly,  
   He felt sharp claws about his knee,  
And, looking down, no little wroth,  
He saw a huge and monstrous sloth,  
   That with such force did hug his thighs  
   And gript his arms in such hard wise,  
That he could scarce with bended shield  
Resist him, nor with power could wield  
   His trusty sword; and as he strove  
   That monster from his grip to move,  
The dragon with so fell a swoop  
Against him from on high did stoop,  
   That down upon the ground he fell,  
   And in the falling did repel  
The sloth from off him. Then the twain  
With such foul rage at him again  
   Did press and buffet, that the life  
   Out of his breast with that fierce strife  
Was well nigh chased: but, by good hap,  
It chanced he fell into the lap  
   Of those fair blooms of various kind  
   That did his victory call to mind  
Against the cruel beaten foes;  
And, falling heavily from blows  
   Of beak and tallons, he with such  
   A grinding weight did press and crush  
The blossoms in the harsh and rude  
Encounter, they must needs exude  
   From out their chalices the sweet  
   And precious essences that meet  
To make the perfume of a flower,  
And on his face and hands did shower  
   Their gracious balms. So sweet they were  
   And of a potency so rare  
For salving every earthly pain,  
The life began in every vein  
   With their pure touch to run and glow;  
   And soon the weary weight and woe  
That lay on Floris was dispell'd.  
Then, with new strength, from him he fell'd  
   That hideous sloth; and being free  
   An instant from his tyranny  
And harsh oppression, to his feet  
He sprang once more, and to defeat  
   The wingèd worm himself address'd.  
   That tore and ravish'd at his crest  
With ceaseless fury; but it drew  
Beyond his reaching, when it knew  
   Its comrade worsted, and was fain  
   To wait till it revived again.  
But Floris, with a doubled hand,  
Smote at the bear with his good brand  
   So fell a stroke, the sharp death slid  
   Through bone and sinew and forbid  
Returning life to enter in  
That loathly dwelling, foul with sin  
   And sloth;--and so the thing was dead.  
   And from the blood its slit veins bled  
There came to life the blossoms sweet  
And gold-eyed of the Marguerite,  
   Incoronate with petals white.  
  
   But that foul serpent with the sight  
Of that good blow so sorely grieved  
And fill'd with rage to be bereaved  
   Of its grim comrade was, it threw  
   All fear aside and fiercely flew  
At Floris, with the armèd sting  
Of its writhed tail all quivering  
   In act to strike, and with so strong  
   A swoop the dart did thrust and throng  
Through dent and ring of riven mail,  
The deadly point it did prevail  
   To bury deep in Floris' breast.  
   Whereat such rage the knight possess'd  
That all the dolour he forgot  
(Though very fierce it was, God wot,  
   And sad) and throwing down his blade,  
   With such a mighty force he laid  
To drag that scorpion from his side,  
The serpent's tail in twain he wried  
   And in such hideous wounds it rent,  
   That from the body coil'd and bent  
With anguish it must needs divide.  
Wherewith the cleft did open wide,  
   And such a flood therefrom did flow  
   Of blood upon the herbs below  
That needs it seem'd the flowers must die;  
And with the pain so fierce a cry  
   Of agony the dragon gave,  
   There is no heart of man so brave  
And firm but he must quake at it.  
  
And now the doom of death was writ  
   In heaven for that unholy beast;  
   And in a little while it ceased  
To cry, and down upon the ground  
It fell and died; and all around  
   The firm earth quaked. And as it died,  
   The blood--that wither'd far and wide  
The herbs and 'mid the stalks did boil  
For rage--was dried into the soil;  
   Wherefore there sprang from out the stain  
   The holy purple of vervain,  
The plant that purgeth earth's desire.  
  
Now may Sir Floris well aspire  
   To have that peace he needeth so,  
   And easance after toil and woe:  
For there is none to fight with him  
Of all those beasts so fell and grim;  
   Nor any sign of further foe  
   Within the garden is, I trow,  
To let him from his victory;  
And all around the place was free  
   From fear; the breezes were atune  
   Again with birdsongs, and the boon  
Of scent within the flowers once more  
Was golden, nor the heavens wore  
   The hue of horror and dismay:  
   And so me may be blithe and gay  
And have sweet pleasance.  
  
                              But alas!  
No thought of this for Floris was.  
   Within his veins the venom 'gan  
   To curdle, and the red blood ran  
With frozen slowness, as the sting  
Of pain went ever gathering  
   Fresh fierceness through him. Very nigh  
   It seem'd to him he was to die.  
He felt the chill of the last hour  
Creep through him and the deathsweats pour  
   Adown his brow: such agony  
   Along his every vein did flee,  
He could no longer up endure,  
Nor hope for any aid or cure;  
   But down upon the earth he sank  
   Aswoon, with faded lips that drank  
The dews of death, and, with a prayer  
Half mutter'd in his last despair,  
   The sense forsook him. So he lay  
   Aswoon, poor knight, and (well-a-way!)  
Most like to die.  
  
                              But there was thought  
In heaven for him that thus had fought  
   For that fair garden's sake. The love  
   Of the dear God that dwells above  
Was mindful of him, though he knew  
It not. And so to him there drew  
   A tender dream,--as there he lay  
   Smitten to death with that fierce fray,--  
And fill'd his thought; and it did seem  
To him, by virtue of the dream,  
   That over him an angel stood,  
   And with a sweet compassion view'd  
His piteous state, and whiles did strew  
Soft balms upon him, strange and new  
   Unto his sense,--so comforting  
   And sweet of scent, they seem'd to bring  
To him the airs of Paradise;  
And with their touch the cruel ice  
   Of death, that bound his every sense,  
   Was melted wholly; and the dense  
And cruel anguish, that untied  
The threads of living, did subside;  
   And gradually peace came back  
   Into his spirit, and the rack  
Of pain and agony from him  
Was lifted. So upon the rim  
   Of the sad soul a little life  
   Began to hover, as at strife  
With Death, reluctant to forego  
His late assurèd prey; and so  
   The breath came back by slow degrees  
   To the spent soul, and in great ease  
Awhile he lay: and whiles he dream'd  
He was in heaven, and it seem'd  
   He heard the golden harpings stir  
   The air to glory, and the choir  
Of seraphim that stand around  
The throne, with one sweet pulse of sound  
   Coörder'd, lift descant of praise  
   To Him that is the Lord of Days  
And Ancient.  
  
                              Then he seem'd to hear  
A voice that murmur'd in his ear--  
   As 'twere a ring of broken chords  
   Angelic, mingled with sweet words  
(So silver-clear it was)--and bade  
Him open eyes: and then one laid  
   Soft hand upon his lids, and drew  
   The darkness from them. So the blue  
Of heaven again was visible  
To him, as 'twere some great sweet bell  
   Of magic flowerage in some prime  
   Of summer in old fairy-time:  
And drinking slowly use of light  
And sense of life and its delight  
   Back into eyes and brain, he turn'd  
   His gaze from where the heaven burn'd  
With full sweet summer, and was ware  
Of a fair champion standing there,  
   Past mortal beauty. All in white  
   And spotless mail was he bedight,  
So clear that there is nothing fair  
And goodly but was mirror'd there,  
   And yet no evil thing nor sad  
   Was there. Upon his helm he had  
   A fair gold cross. Upon his crest  
A fair gold cross, and on his shield  
The semblance of a lamb did wield  
   A fair gold cross. Upon his crest    The snows of a fair plume did
rest  
And waved; and eke his pennoncel  
Was white as is the new-blown bell  
   Of that fair flower that loves the wind,  
   And round his dexter arm was twined  
A snow of silk. Full glorious  
The splendour of his harness was,  
   And wonder-lovely to behold:  
   But as white silver and red gold  
Are pale beside the diamond,  
So was his visage far beyond  
   His arms in glory and delight  
   Of beauty. There was such a might  
Of stainless virtue and of all  
Perfection pictured, and withal  
   So woundrous tender in aspèct  
   He was, it seem'd as if the Elect  
Of Christ on earth in him did live;  
That, with glad eyes, men might arrive,  
   Beholding him, to know that love  
   And gentilesse of God and prove  
In him the sweetness of that grace  
That shinèd ever in Christ's face  
   On earth.  
  
                              And so in very deed  
   It seem'd to Floris that the need  
Of earth was over, and his soul  
Was won thereto where life is whole--  
Withouten any stress or dole--  
   At last in joyance, and his eyes  
   Did view, in robes of Paradise,  
That tender angel of the Lord,  
That into men's sore bosoms pour'd  
   Sweet balms and comfort, being set  
   To temper justice and the fret  
Of life with love most pitiful.  
And whilst he thus did gaze his full  
   Upon the radiance of that wight,  
   The soft and undefiled delight,  
That in his eyes did hold full sway,  
So purged all Floris' awe away  
   And eke such boldness to him gave  
   That he was fain of him to crave  
His name.  
  
                              Then, "I am Galahad,  
Christ's knight," he said.  
  
                              Whereat full glad  
was Floris, and all reverently  
Unto the earth he bent his knee  
   Before the knight, and (an he list)  
   Would fain the broider'd hem have kiss'd  
Of his white robe; but Galahad  
Did raise him quickly up and bade  
   Him henceforth kneel to God alone,  
   That on the height of Heaven's throne  
Is for man's soul the only one  
Of worship, save sweet Christ, His Son.  
   And Mary mother pitiful;  
   And henceforth were no kings that rule  
So blest as Floris now should be,  
Since that with such high constancy  
   And noble faith he had withstood  
   The shock of that unholy brood,  
And if fair fight had vanquish'd them.  
Wherefore for crown and diadem  
   Of triumph, on the greensward freed  
   From those foul beasts that there did bleed  
Their life away beneath his blade,  
In goodly order were array'd  
   For him those pleasant blooms and fair,  
   That not alone so debonair  
And blithe of aspect were, but eke  
Had virtues--more than one might speak  
   In wearing of a summer's day--  
   For purging fleshly lusts away  
And cleansing from his heart--who wore  
Their beauty fairly--all the sore  
   Sad doubts and weariness of earth,  
   So that with an immortal mirth  
And constant faith his soul was glad,  
And evermore sweet peace he had  
   In love of God and eke of Christ,  
   The which against all ills sufficed  
Of mortal life. And as he spoke  
From the slight stems those flowers he broke  
   That 'midst the herbage did entreat  
   The eye with blossom very sweet  
And gracious; and (O wonderment!)  
Being in his hand conjoin'd, they blent  
   Their essences in such rare wise,  
   It seem'd from each sweet bell did rise  
A sweeter perfume, and more bright  
Their semblance grew, as 'twere some might  
   Of amity was moved in them--  
   Being so join'd into one stem--  
To heighten each one's loveliness  
With all its fellows did possess  
   Of blithe and sweet. And therewithal,  
   When from the grass those flow'rets all  
Were gather'd, to Sir Floris came  
That noblest knight, and in Christ's name,  
   With fairest look and friendliest speech,  
   Him of kindness did beseech  
That he from him those blooms would take  
And breathe their fragrance.  
  
                              Scarce awake  
   From swoon was Floris yet; and so  
   He took them with dull hands and slow,  
And did address himself to scent  
Their breath, as one half indolent  
   With sleep; but when the gracious smell  
   Was won to him, that from each bell  
Did float and hovering was blent  
Into some wondrous ravishment  
   Of sweets,--there smote him such a sense  
   Of gladsome ease and recompense  
Of all his labours, that the dull  
Gross drowsiness, that did annul  
   The soul within the man, forsook  
   Him wholly; and withal he took  
Such gladness, that in every vein  
The life seem'd blithely born again;  
   And through his frame so fresh a flood  
   Of ardour pour;d, it seem'd the blood--  
That in men's pulses sluggishly  
Does throb and flutter--was made free  
   From earthly baseness and was turn'd  
   To heavenly ichor. For there burn'd  
Within him such a fire of hope,  
He felt his soul no more did grope  
   Within the dreary dusk of earth,  
   But on the wings of a new birth  
Towards the highest heaven did soar.  
Nor was there for him any more  
   A thought of weariness or woe;  
   But from the earth he rose, and so  
Was ready for all venturing  
And all the quest of holy thing  
   God might appoint him.  
  
                              Then that knight,  
   That was apparell'd all in white,--  
Most brightly smiling at the new  
Glad ardour that did straight ensue  
   In Floris with those blossoms' scent,  
   And at the holy joy that brent  
Upon the dial of his face,--  
Within his arms did him embrace  
   And kiss'd him very lovingly.  
   Then in this wise to him spake he,  
With grave sweet speech.  
  
                              "Beyond the brine,  
Where in the Orient first the sign  
   Of dawn upon the sky is set,--  
   In that sweet clime where men forget  
The winter, and the summer lies  
So lovingly upon the skies,  
   That of a truth the very night  
   Is lucent and the cruel sprite  
Of darkness never wholly hides  
The flowers, but aye some light abides,  
   Wherefore men call it morning-land,--  
   A fair and stately house doth stand,  
Wherein, by help of God His grace,  
Unto my lot it fell to place  
   That holy token of the Lord,  
   That He to mortals did afford  
Awhile on earth to look upon  
For consolation; but anon,  
   Moved to slow anger by their sin  
   And stubborn wickedness, within  
His mystery He did withdraw  
The blessèd thing: but yet the law  
   Of that sad doom He temperèd--  
   Of His great grace and kindlihead--  
With mercy. For it was ordain'd  
That of one kept himself unstain'd  
   And pure from every lust and sin,  
   A virgin, he should surely win  
And come to taste of that sweet food  
Of the Redemeer's flesh and blood.  
   And unto me such grace was given  
   That of all champions that have striven  
I have been chosen from the rest  
For winning of the Holy Quest;  
   Since that, as in the Writ we read,  
   God of the humblest may indeed  
Be pleased to make His instrument,  
Even unto me that joy was sent,  
   Surpassing all that of old time  
   Is told for us in minstrel's rhyme  
Of Heaven's mercy: and, God wot,  
Were passèd o'er Sir Lancelot  
   And sweet Sir Tristam, that again  
   The world shall never of those twain  
Behold the like, such debonair  
And perfect gentle knights they were.  
  
   "Wherefore to God it seemèd fit  
   That a fair dwelling over it  
Should for its safe keeping be built:  
And that no breath of sin or guilt  
   Might there approach, there was enroll'd  
   A band of knight, in whom the gold  
Of virtue had been smelted out  
And purified from sin and doubt  
   By toil and venture perilous.  
   And in that high and holy house  
In goodly fellowship they dwell,  
Until to God it seemeth well--  
   For long good service done--to call  
   One of the brethren from the thrall  
Of earthly life, and with His blest  
In Paradise to give him rest.  
   Wherefore, when one is call'd away,  
   It is ordain'd that from the grey  
Of the sad world another knight--  
To fill his place who, benedight,  
   Has won the guerdon of his strife--  
   Be chosen out, to cast off life  
And with much labour and much pain  
Be purified from earthly stain  
   And tried with woe. If he endure  
   And from the furnace come out pure  
Of sin and lusting, he shall stand  
For the dead brother in the band  
   Angelical, and shall be set  
   With those that, pure of earthly fret,  
Do guard the shrine miraculous.  
  
"In such a wise enrollèd was  
   Sir Percivale; and Lohengrin  
   By like adventuring did win  
Among the holy knights to sit;  
And many more of whom ye wit.  
   And lately it the Lord hath pleased  
   That yet another should be eased  
Of his long service and preferr'd  
Among the angels to be heard  
   And scent the breath of heaven's rosen.  
   And in his stead hast thou been chosen  
In much hard strife to be assay'd  
And for Christ's service fitting made.  
   Wherefore this venture has been given  
   To thee, in which thou now hast striven  
So wonder-well, that thou mightst win  
To purge thyself of earthly sin.  
   And having in good sooth prevail'd  
   Against all dangers that assail'd  
Thee and this garden's purity,  
There is great bliss ordain'd for thee;  
   For that thy name shall be enroll'd  
   Among those knights in ward that hold  
The blessed Grail; and thou with me  
Beyond the billows of the sea  
   Shalt come to where that house is fair  
   Withouten any pain or care,  
And shalt awhile taste heaven's bliss,  
And on thy mouth shalt have the kiss  
   Of Christ the Lord, that doth assoil  
   All weariness of earthly toil  
And gives unto all sorrows peace  
Undying."  
  
                              So the strain did cease  
   Of his sweet speaking, and awhile  
   The very sweetness of his smile  
Did hinder Floris from reply:  
And eke the thought of bliss so nigh  
   His lips and all the ravishment  
   Of promise that he did prevent  
In his imagining and lack  
Of words for utterance held back  
   His tongue from speaking anything.  
   But Galahad for answering  
Stay'd not, but, with a doubled grace  
Of sweet assurance in his face,  
   Began to say, in very deed,  
   That presently there was great need  
They should withouten more delay  
Towards the dawning take their way,  
   For many a mile the voyage was  
   And for great distance tedious.  
  
Then Floris said to him, "Fair knight,  
That in whole armour of pure white  
   Dost serve God in all chastity,  
   I pri'thee, lightly show to me  
How we may gain that distant land  
That by the rising sun is scann'd,--  
   Since neither boat is here nor had?"  
  
   Whereat no word spake Galahad  
But with his hand the sign he made,  
That makes all evil things afraid  
   And compasses all good about  
   With armour against sin and doubt;  
And straightway with the holy sign  
A white cross in the air did shine  
   A second, as for answering;  
   And then the stream's soft murmuring  
Grew louder to the sweep of waves  
Along the reed-crests and the glaives  
   Of rushes, and its silver thread  
   Into a river's mightihead  
Was stretch'd; and on the stream did float  
The silver wonder of a boat,  
   Gold-keel'd and fair with silken sails,  
   Such boat as, in old Eastern tales,  
The genii bring at the command  
Of some enchanter's magic wand.  
   And on the prow of cymophane--  
   Translucent as the pearly wane  
Of that fair star that rules the night,  
With an internal glory bright--  
   The milk-white holy bird did sit  
   And spread soft pinions over it,  
That flutter'd with desire of flight.  
  
Therein stepp'd Galahad, Christ's knight;  
   And after him did Floris come  
   At beckoning, wholly dazed and dumb  
With wonders of that wondrous time.  
And as into the stern did climb  
   The valiant knight, the soft sweet wind  
   That 'mid the blossom'd trees was twined,  
Ceased from its disport in the flowers  
And leafage of those magic bowers,  
   And with such strong yet gentle stress  
   Within the silken sails did press  
Towards the dawning, that the keel  
Slid through the waters blue as steel  
   As swiftly as the morning sun  
   Shears through the mists when night is done  
And day is golden in the sky.  
And as it through the lymph did fly  
   Of that enchanted rivulet,  
   The golden keel to song did fret  
The thronging currents, and the ring  
Of murmurous water-notes did sing  
   And ripple in the diamond deeps,  
   Such music as the West wind sweeps  
From out the harps of Fairyland,  
When elves are met on some sweet strand  
   Of Broceliaund or Lyonesse,  
   For revel and for wantonness.  
  
On all sides round them as they went  
The dim grey woods were sad and spent  
   With weariness of winter-time,  
   And in the fields the rugged rime  
Held all things in the sleep of death,  
Stern white, and void of living breath;  
   And with the weary weight of snow  
   The laden boughs were bent and low.  
But in their sails a breath there blew  
Of April zephyrs, and there drew  
   Unto their course a summer cloud  
   With scents of flowers and birdsongs strow'd;  
And echoings of July woods--  
When in the green the bluebell broods--  
   Were thick and sweet about their way,  
   And ever round the boat's prow lay  
The scent of grass-swaths newly mown;  
And wildflowers in gold grain and brown  
   Waved in the sweet dream-haunted air.  
  
   So went they,--while the night was bare  
Of sound or breath to break the sleep  
Of winter,--through the woodlands deep,  
   And past the well-remember'd plains  
   And towns and meadows, where the lanes  
And streets were hush'd with winter-time,--  
And saw no creature on the rime,  
   Save some stray sheep shut out from fold  
   Or wolf, that from his forest hold  
Was by hard hunger forced to seek  
Scant prey upon the moorlands bleak.  
  
   So ever without cease they sped  
   Above that swift sweet river's bed;  
And truly, as the golden morn  
From out the dim grey mists was born  
   And all things 'gan to wake from sleep,  
   They heard the silver rush and sweep  
Of waves upon a pebbled shore;  
And gliding past the meadows frore,  
   They came to where the river's tide  
   Was fleck'd with foam, and far and wide  
The main, as far as eye could see,  
Slept in a sweet serenity.  
  
   Far out to seaward fled their boat,  
   Across the wild white flowers that float  
And blossom on the azure leas;  
And swiftly as the culver flees  
   Among the trees with shadow twined,  
   They left the frozen fields behind,  
And saw the spangled foam divide  
The firmament on every side.  
  
   The golden calm of summer seas  
   Was there, and eke the July breeze  
That waves upon the silver foam,  
When in the azure heaven's dome  
   The sign of summer-prime is set:  
   And still no winds opposed they met,  
Nor break of billows in their way;  
But through the dancing ripples' play  
   The shallop sped towards the dawn,  
   As by some starry influence drawn  
Over the ridges of the main  
Unstirr'd and clear. And still the rain  
   Of blossoms fell about the stem,  
   And still sweet odours breathed on them  
Of rose and jasmine, and the song  
Of birds about the sail was strong.  
  
   So over silver seas they went,  
   And heaven, wide-eyed for wonderment,  
Hung o'er them open blue the while,  
As though all nature were asmile  
   To see the lovely way they made:  
   And ever round the sharp keel play'd  
The fretted lacework of the foam,  
And through the jewell'd deeps did roam  
   Great golden fish, and corals red  
   Waved in the dim sweet goodlihead  
Of that clear blue; and through the wave  
The shells of many a rich cave  
   Were visible, wherein the sea  
   Held in a sweet security  
Treasures of pearl and lovely gold,  
That eye of man might ne'er behold  
   Until the main should leave its bed;  
   And over all the deeps was shed  
A glancing play of emerald light,  
So that the unembarrass'd sight  
   Pierced through the cool sweet mystery  
   Of folded billows, and the eye  
Was free in shadows jewel-clear.  
Nor was there anything of fear  
   For them in lapse of hyaline  
   Or silver breakers of the brine;  
Nor in the crystals of the air  
Was anything but blithe and fair,  
   Sweet winds and glitter of fair birds,  
   Whose song was sweeter than sweet words  
Between the pauses of a kiss,  
When lovers meet in equal bliss.  
  
   So many a day they sail'd and long,  
   Lull'd by the breezes' flower-sweet song  
And pipe of jewel-birds that went  
Above them, fair to ravishment;  
   Until, one morn, athwart the lift  
   Of blue was visible a rift  
Of purple mountain; and a spire  
Of amethyst rose ever higher  
   Into the sapphire firmament.  
   And drawing nigh, they saw where blent  
Its silver currents with the blue  
Of that bright ocean, blithe to view,  
   A fair clear river that outpour'd  
   Its waters 'twixt soft green of sward  
And slope of flower-besprinkled banks,  
Where rushes stood in arching ranks,  
   Tipt with a jewel of fair flower  
   As blue as is the morning hour,  
When in the golden prime of May  
The sweet dawn blends into the day.  
  
   The swift keel slid between the rows  
   Of ripples,--as a steed that knows  
The road of some familiar place,--  
And past the bubbled foamy race  
   Of eddies, through the sapphire cleft  
   Of that bright pass, and quickly left  
The billows of the sea behind,  
As on that goodly stream the wind  
   Did urge it far into the land.  
   Surely was never kingdom spann'd  
On earth by river such as this,  
Where ever some enchanted bliss  
   Ran in the ripples, and the stream  
   With liquid gold and pearl did seem  
To glitter. There is nought more fair  
Beneath the regions of the air  
   Than this same river; nor in all  
   Birdnotes is aught more musical  
Than the delight of its clear flow  
Across the pebbles, soft and low.  
   And in the banks were wondrous things,  
   All lovely creatures that bear wings;  
And every precious thing of green,  
And flower of gold and jewell'd sheen,  
   Was there in such a perfect shape,  
   Its essence must full needs escape  
The grasp of my poor minstrelsy.  
The very grass was fair to see  
   Beyond the fairest flower of earth;  
   For with the gold of some new birth  
It burnt, and was aflame with bright  
Sweet gladness. Very flames of light  
   The flowers seem'd, zaffiran and blue  
   And crystal-clear with wonder-dew.  
It seem'd their scent so heavenly was,  
That into music it must pass  
   And soar into a perfumed song.  
   And as the boat was borne along  
The golden ripples, in its speed  
Dividing many a woven weed,  
   That with its many-colour'd mesh  
   Of trailing leaves and flowers did stretch  
And wave upon the waters bright,--  
Sir Floris, with what prayers he might,  
   That gracious Galahad besought  
   That from his lips he might be taught  
What was that river and that realm,  
That all earth's sweets did hide and whelm  
   In one etern forgetfulness,  
   And made all joys that men possess  
Seem poor and naught with the delight  
Of its exceeding lovely might.  
   And without pausing, Galahad  
   To him made answer fair and glad.  
  
"Fair knight, this land through which we pass,  
About the city of Sarras  
   Doth lie; and all the golden plain  
   Beyond thy vision, for demesne--  
By grace and favour of high Heaven--  
Unto the Holy Town was given,  
   Where lies in hold the blessed Grail.--  
  
   "Before from Paradise did fail  
Adam and Eva for their sin,  
These happy fields and glades within  
   The golden gates of Eden were  
   Wherein was nothing but was fair:  
And this same river of those four  
Was one, that of old times did pour  
   Blithe waters over all the plain,  
   When life was young and free from stain,  
And angels walk'd upon the earth.  
And (for their flow) came never dearth  
   Of kindly fruits nor any drought  
   Of summer-time the place about;  
Nor for the warmth of their clear flood  
Might winter nip the flowery bud  
   Of the perpetual spring, that rain'd  
   Fresh blossoms there; nor ever waned  
The balms of summer in the air,  
But evermore the place was fair  
   With all May-sweets and summer-spells.  
   And still,-although the cloister'd dells  
Of the lost garden no more stand  
Upon the peace of the fair land,--  
   Around its precincts, as of old,  
   A silver stream with sands of gold  
Flows ever, which no foot of man,  
Or eye, without Christ's leave, can span;  
   Of all the four the only one  
   That still with murmurous waves doth run  
In the old channel. Very fair  
Its marges are with all things rare;  
   And over all the land is strown  
   Thick bdellium and the onyx-stone."  
  
And many another wondrous thing  
Unto Sir Floris, listening,  
   Spake Galahad of that fair land,  
   That eye of man hath never scann'd,  
Save he have won to Christ His grace.  
And and as he spoke, came on apace  
   The tender day, and gilded all  
   The ripples; and the golden ball  
Of the sweet sun rose high in heaven;  
And unto every thing was given  
   New ravishment and new delight  
   Of very waking. Fairer sight  
Saw mortal never (nor indeed  
So fair within our earthly need  
   Is compass'd) than the morning hour  
   That open'd into full sweet flower  
With many a rosy flush and rain  
Of golden sunlight over plain  
   And mead, and many a tender shade  
   Kiss'd into warmth--that in green glade  
Lay waiting for the frolic light--  
And changed to fleecy gold the white  
   Of dawn-clouds over hill and wold.  
   It was so gracious to behold  
The day in that sweet Paradise,  
There is no man with mortal eyes  
   Could drink its beauty wholly in,  
   For dust of care and mirk of sin  
That hide much loveliness from men.  
  
And Floris ever and again  
   Was dumb with awe of much delight  
   And wonderment; as with swift flight  
The boat sped through the flowers that shone  
With blazon'd gold and blue upon  
   That magic river of a dream,  
He sat and stored the influence  
Of the lush balms within his sense,  
   And watch'd the ripples all agleam  
With jewels, and the constant smile  
Of the sweet sunlight. And the while  
   The songs of his birds co-ordinate  
   And zephyrs with a peace so great  
And sweet upon his soul did seize,  
And whiles his spirit had such ease  
   In that sweet speech of Galahad,  
   He needs forgot that aught of sad  
Or dreary in this life is set,  
Or weariness of earthly fret;  
   And did, without a backward glance,  
   Yield up himself into the trance  
Of that new joy.  
  
                              So sped they on  
Towards the orient: and anon,--  
   Whenas the noon was borne along  
   The midmost heaven, to the song  
Triumphal of the joyous choir  
Of birds and breezes, ever higher  
   Soaring in one sweet antiphon,--  
   There rose in the sweet sky--upon  
The fair broad hem of woven gold,  
That marged with many a fleecy fold  
   The sapphire-chaliced firmament--  
   A glitter of tall spires, that brent  
With an unearthly radiance;  
And many a jewel-colour'd lance  
   Of belfry pierced the golden air  
   On the horizon: and there bare  
The wind to them a strain of song  
Ineffable, the stream along--  
   Faint for great distance--that for joy  
   And triumph over earth's annoy  
With such a rapturous sweetness smote  
On Floris, he could neither note  
   The kingdom's varied loveliness  
   Nor the sweet antiphonal stress  
Of winds and birds and rivulet,  
But it alone could hear, nor let  
   Himself from striving up to it;  
   For with its melody was knit  
About his soul an influence  
So strong, it seem'd his every sense  
   Must press towards it. And at last,  
   For ecstasy he would have cast  
Himself headlong into the stream,  
That therewithal, as he did deem,  
   He might the swiftlier win toward  
   That wondrous singing and the ward  
Of that bright town miraculous.  
But Galahad the good knight was  
   Mindful of him, and by his arm  
   Withholding him therefrom, did charm  
His soul with such sweet words, that he  
Must for a while contented be  
   To wait the progress of the boat,  
   That very speedily did float,  
God wot, across the ripples' race,  
To where the turrets of the place  
   Were clear.  
  
                              And so they came at last  
   To where the running river pass'd  
From the long lapse of pleasant wood  
And meadow with enchantments strew'd  
   Of flowers and sun-gold, and were ware  
   Of the bright town that all the air  
With towers and pinnacles did fill,  
Set on the slope of a soft hill,  
   That in the sun wore one clear hue  
   Of purple blending into blue,  
Most like a great sweet amethyst.  
  
And now the gunwale softly kiss'd  
   The golden shore; and, thick with gem  
   And coral, round the entering stem  
Was wrinkled up the glittering sand.  
Then Galahad upon the strand  
   Stepp'd lightly out; and as his feet  
   Upon the grainèd gold did meet  
Of the rich shingle, there was borne  
To them the noise of a blown horn,  
   That was as if a warder blew  
   To challenge, from some tower of view  
Within the amber-gated town;  
Wherefrom to them it floated down  
   And fill'd the air with echoings  
   So sweet, there is no bird that sings  
Could find such music in his throat  
Melodious. And as the note  
   Of welcome swell'd and waned around  
   The hollows of the hills,--unwound  
From his mail'd breast Sir Galahad  
A silver horn he thereon had  
   In its white baldrick, and therein  
   Breathing, its hollow bell did win  
Unto so sweet an answering blast,  
It seem'd to Floris that at last  
   He heard the trumps angelical.  
   Then at the silver clarion's call  
The beryl gates were open'd wide  
Of the fair town; and on the side  
   Of the soft hill there was to them  
   Made visible--upon the hem  
Of woven grass with blue-bells strew'd  
And asphodels--a multitude  
   Of holy knights, that down the sward  
   In a bright painted pageant pour'd,  
With many a waving pennoncel  
Of gold and azure; and the swell  
   Of clarions, co-ordinate  
   To mystic harmonies, did wait,  
With cadences most grave and sweet,  
Upon the rhythm of their feet.  
   So goodly were they of aspèct  
   And in such pictured raiment deck'd  
Of say and samite, there is none,  
Minstrel or bard, beneath the sun,  
   That could have sung of their array  
   As it befits to sing it,--nay  
Not even he who many a day  
In Fäerie enchanted lay  
   And learnt full many a year and long  
   The cadences of elfin song,  
True Thomas; nor that couthliest wight  
In gramarye, that Merlin hight.  
  
   Full bright their arms and lucent were  
   And of a sheen so wonder-fair,  
The sun seem'd of a nobler kind  
To glitter, when his beamings shined  
   Upon the silver-mirror'd mail.  
   And at the sight of them did fail  
Sir Floris' courage, that till now  
Had never seen thing high enow  
   To give him pause; for there did come  
   So strange a fear on him, that dumb  
And cold he grew, and haply might  
Have swoon'd away for sheer affright  
   Of wonder and great reverence  
   That lay upon his every sense.  
Indeed, awhile the blood did leave  
Its courses and great awe did weave  
   Strange terrors in him; and with pain  
   And fear despiteous, he was fain  
To hide his visage from the might  
Of that much brightness.  
  
                              Then that knight  
   Sir Galahad laid hands on him,  
   And quickly freed him from the grim  
Sad grasp of that unreal fear,  
And bade him that of right good cheer  
   He should become, for knighthood's sake,  
   And for his honour comfort take  
And new stout heart, for shame it was  
And despite, one so valorous  
   And bold in arms should faint and fail,  
   Where he most surely should prevail,  
'Midst those that now his comrades were  
And fellow-knights: and with much fair  
   Discourse did win him from affright.  
   So that at last he dared the sight  
Of those fair knights, and saw they gazed  
Right courteously on him and praised  
   His hard-won victory. So he took  
   New heart, and with assurèd look  
Leapt out upon the jewell'd sand:  
And as the twain were come to land,  
   From those knights all so sweet a sound  
   Of songful greeting did resound,  
The blue of heaven could never tire  
Of answering; and from many a lyre  
   And cithern the alternate joy  
   Of harpings join'd in sweet alloy  
Its silver with that golden song.  
  
So Floris was among that throng  
   Of knights received, with many a kiss  
   And glad embracement: nor, I wis,  
Fail'd Galahad that he should name  
Each knight that to the greeting came.  
   To him was Titurel made known,  
   And Percivale, to whom was shown--  
With Bors--such grace of God most high,  
By reason of much purity,  
   That they alone with Galahad  
   Upon the earthly questing had  
The blessed vision of the Grail:  
Nor Lohengrin to him did fail;  
   And may another noble knight  
Of fabled prowess and approved  
In gentilesse and all Christ loved,  
   Did there rejoice him with his sight.  
  
   So, for the meed of his good fight,  
Into the wonder-town they bare  
Sir Floris,--wherein many a rare  
   Delight to him appointed was.  
  
   Bright was the place and glorious  
With glory of the abiding love  
Of God and Christ, that is above  
   All splendours marvellous and fair;  
   And luminous its ramparts were  
With pearls and rubies constellate  
And diamonds into such state  
   And harmony as, save in heaven,  
   Unto no place or thing is given  
To wear or look on: such a blaze  
Of joy was there, without amaze;  
   For all was gracious and sweet  
   With Christ His grace. The very feet  
That fell upon the jewell'd stones  
Compell'd them to such silver tones  
   Of music, and the ruffled air  
   Was stirr'd to harmonies so fair,  
And, for mere passage through the place,  
Was won to such a subtle grace  
   Of perfume, that therein to be  
   And move, was one long ecstasy:  
And there the dole of earth and stress  
Of hope unfill'd and weariness  
   Was purged, and life was one delight  
   Of perfect function, by the might  
Unfailing of the doubtless soul;  
And every act and thought was whole  
   In strifeless àccord. If one spoke,  
   The hinder'd voice no longer broke  
Into harsh sadness, spent and wried  
With weary effort, but did glide  
   Into an unconstrain'd consent  
   Of harmony and ravishment  
Unstressful; and the every geste  
Was with like subtle grace possess'd,  
   And every faculty was cast  
   In symmetry, what time one pass'd  
The portals of the place, and heard  
The echoes of his feet that stirr'd  
   The holy quiet.  
  
                              So the spell  
   Of the charm'd place on Floris fell  
Transfiguringly, as the wide  
Gold-trellised leaves on either side  
   Swung back for him: there came a change  
   Upon his senses, and a strange  
Sweet ease of life, as if the soul,  
Way-worn and rusted with the dole  
   And fret of earth, were softly riven  
   From him, and its stead were given  
To him a new and perfect one,  
In a whole body as the sun  
   Lucent, and worthy for the seat  
   Of the fair spirit.  
  
                              Up the street  
Gold-paven and with chrysolite  
And jacinth marged, they brought the knight,  
   Past many a goodly hostelry  
   And many a dwelling fair to see,  
Unto a portal sculptured all  
With handiwork angelical,  
   In stories of the love of Christ,  
   And all the time it hath sufficed  
To win sad living to much ease;--  
And passing through with harmonies  
   Of choral song, they came unto  
   A vaulted courtyard, stretching through  
A cloister'd vista to fair halls  
Of alabaster, where the walls  
   With many a colour'd crystal shone  
   Of jewell'd casement; and thereon  
The questing of the Holy Grail,  
In many a wonder-lovely tale,  
   Was with bright gold and wonderment  
   Of colour'd jewel-fretwork blent  
To harmony, depicturèd.  
And there, in truth, Sir Floris read,--  
   Beside much other venturing,  
   And many another goodly thing  
Achieved in service of the Lord,--  
The fight that he with his good sword  
   Had in the wonder-garden fought.  
   Nor, therewithal, was missing aught  
Of all that did that night befall  
Unto him: but upon the wall  
   Was in bright colours pictured forth  
   The tale of all his knightly worth  
And service.  
  
                              Little strange it is  
If much he wonder'd was at this,  
   And could for wonder scarce believe  
   His eyes, that any should achieve  
So vast a work and of such grace  
And splendour in so scant a space  
   Of time. But Lohengrin besought  
   Him very fairly that of nought  
He saw he should be wonderèd,  
Nor any venture have in dread;  
   Since that to that high Lord, that there  
   Did reign, all wonders easy were  
And wonderless; nor of His grace  
Was anything in all that place  
   That might avail for any fear  
   Or doubt, but rather to give cheer  
And love and confidence was fit,  
So sweet a peace did dwell in it  
   Of amity and holiness.  
  
   Then with slow feet they did address  
Their further steps,--by a long aisle  
Of cloister'd pearl, wherethrough the smile  
   Of sunlight filter'd lingeringly  
   And lay in one sweet soften'd sea  
Of gold upon the silver mail,--  
Towards the temple of the Grail.  
   And in a vestibule, that was  
   Thereto adjacent, did they pause  
And in fair garments clad the knight,  
With silver radiant and white.  
   And then into an armoury  
   They led him, very fair to see  
With noble weapons, all arow  
Against the wainscot. There a snow  
   Of plumes upon his crest they bound,  
   And from the swords that hung around  
A goodly blade was given him,  
That to the sound of many a hymn  
   And many a golden litany,  
   Had in the glorious armoury  
Of highest heaven forgèd been:  
So trenchant was it and so keen,--  
   Being in celestial fires assay'd  
   And in strange dews of heaven made  
Attemper'd,--there might none withstand  
The thunderstroke of that good brand,  
   Except his bosom armour'd were  
   With equal virtue. Then the fair  
Graven presentment of a dove  
With eyes of gold ws set above  
   His helm,--most like the fowl that brought  
   Him to the garden where he wrought  
Such deeds of arms; and on the field  
Coerulean of his virgin shield  
   There was a like resemblant set,  
   That men might know him, when they met  
In sharp sword-play or battle-throng.  
  
Then, with a ripple of sweet song,  
   The golden doors were backward roll'd,  
   That in sweet mystery did fold  
The holy place; and Floris came  
Into a hall, where with a flame  
   Of jewell'd light the air was gilt;  
   And therewithin the walls were built  
Of that clear sapphire jewelry  
That can in nowise elsewhere be  
   Save for the pavement of the sky  
   And for the throne of God most high.  
And under foot the floor was bright  
With one clear topaz, as the light  
   Of the sweet sun in hue. Above  
   There was y-sprad a flower-bell roof  
Of that sweet colour of deep blue  
One in the spring may chance to view,  
   When in the golden-threaded moss  
   The deep wood-dells are odorous  
With violets and the cluster'd bells  
Of bee-loved hyacinths, or else  
   The deep clear colours pers and inde  
   Of wild-flowers in the gold corn twined  
With many a tassel of bright blue,  
When summer in the skies is new.--  
   And in the bell were golden lights,  
   Most like the tender eye-delights  
Of the gold kingcups in the green,  
That in quaint wise were set between  
   The fretted azure of the dome.  
   And therethrough did meteors roam,  
As 'twere in truth the very heaven,  
And the sweet symbols of the seven  
   Great angels that do rule the skies  
   Where therein jewell'd. In such wise  
The varied lights were mixt and blent  
With those that heavenward were sent  
   From walls and pavement,--all the air  
   Was with that lightsomeness most fair  
And tender fill'd, that in the May  
Is weft about the sweet young day,  
   When whiles it seems the sky is dight  
   With one great primrose of soft light,  
Most pure and tender. On the ground  
There stood fair statues all around,  
   Deep-set in woven flowers and green  
   Of lavish leafage, stretch'd between  
Tall carven pillars of that bright  
Jewel that chrysoberyl hight,  
   And many another precious stone.  
   Nor there were images alone  
Of holy things, as one might deem;  
But eke full many a lovely dream  
   Of tender love and constancy  
   Was in clear gold and ivory  
With loving hand made manifest.  
For there was nothing there confess'd  
   Of sin or wantonness in love,--  
   As ancient doctors teach, that prove  
All pleasant things that are, to be  
Unloved of God. And verily  
Sir Floris wonder'd there to see  
   The histories that makers tell  
   Of Parisate and Floridelle,  
The tale of Tristan and Ysolde,  
   Of Lancelot and Guenevere,  
And many another tale of old,  
   That men on earth do dully lere  
That we should count accurst and ill:  
But there depictured were they still,  
   In very piteous fashion told;  
   And on the wall in words of gold  
Was writ this legend, *"Quiconque aime  
Complait a Dieu en pechié mesme."*  
  
   And while Sir Floris stood and gazed  
   Upon the statues,--much amazed  
At all that he did hear and see  
Within the temple,--suddenly  
   There was a fluted singing heard,  
   As of some wonder-lovely bird.  
And then one took him by the hand,  
And led him where a gold screen spann'd  
   The topaz paved work of the floor.  
  
   Then was he ware of a high door,  
That with much wonderwork of gold  
And unknown metals was enscroll'd  
   In many a trellis of fair flowers  
   And fronds enough fair for the bowers  
Of Paradise; and in the leaves  
There sat a bird, that was as sheaves  
   Of ripen'd corn in hue, and sang--  
   That therewithal the temple rang--  
Of unknown glories of the May,  
Therein where life is one long day  
   Of spring and never change is there,  
   Nor any sadness in the air.  
And as he sang, the golden gate  
Swung open slowly, and the great  
   Sweet hollow of a pure white pearl  
   Lay clear behind that golden merle,  
Into a chamber fashionèd.  
  
There was an altar built and spread  
   With tapestry of silver white,  
Woven with lilies; and thereon  
Was set a chalice, out of one  
   Great emerald moulded,--with samite,  
The colour of the heart's best blood,  
Enshrouded; and thereover stood  
A great white cross and fill'd the air  
With living radiance, as it were  
   A sculptured work of very light.  
  
   Then with the wonder of the sight  
Was Floris fill'd; and for great awe  
And reverence of all he saw  
   Within the pearl, straightway he fell  
   Upon his knees. But Titurel  
With counsel very fair and wise  
Required of him that he should rise  
   From off the ground and without fear  
   Unto the altar should draw near  
And for an offering thereon  
Should lay those blossoms he had won  
   In parlous fight, and much duresse,  
   That of their blended goodliness  
And eke their perfume's ravishment,  
There might a sacrifice be sent,  
   To God and Christ acceptable.  
  
   And now a wondrous thing befell,  
(God grant us all the like to see);  
For as Sir Floris reverently  
   Upon the silver cloth did lay  
   The holy flowers (that, sooth to say  
Were bright of bloom and sweet of scent,  
Unfaded, as when first they sprent  
   The greensward) and withdrawing thence  
   A little space, in reverence  
The issue did await,--there came  
A hand all shapen out of flame,  
   And from the emerald of the cup  
   The crimson samite lifted up;  
And as this thing was done, there fell--  
As 'twere from out the midmost bell--  
   A light that through the emerald sped  
   And mingled with the holy bread;  
And with the light, came one that pass'd  
Thought-swift athwart the air and cast  
   Himself into the cup,--as 'twere  
   The angel of a child,--most fair  
And awful. Wherewithal thereout  
There went a fire the place about,  
   And fill'd the temple with its breath,  
   Wherein was neither hurt nor death;  
But of its contact there were given  
To Floris very balms of heaven  
   For consecration; and to eat  
   There was vouchsafed him food so sweet  
And goodly such as no man knows.  
  
Then from the chaliced gem there rose  
   The semblance of a face, that was  
   With such a splendour glorious  
And awful--and withal as mild  
And tender as a little child--  
   There is no bard can sing of it  
   As it befitteth, save he sit  
(And hardly then) among the choirs,  
That to the throb of golden lyres  
   Do praise God ever night and day  
   With music such as no man may.--  
There is but one of woman born  
By whom such aspect can be worn  
   Of perfect love and perfect awe  
   Commingled.  
  
                              And when Floris saw  
The glory of the eyes, and knew  
The holy love, that like a dew  
   From out their radiant deeps was shed  
   Upon his soul,--for very dread  
Of ravishment he could not gaze  
Upon their light, but with amaze  
   And wonderment of joy was fain  
   Down to the earth to bend again  
His face: but ere he ceased to see  
The vision, of a surety  
   It was made known to him (although  
   He wist not how he came to know)  
That heavenly face no other's was  
Than that same Lord's who erst did pass  
   Before his vision in the green  
   Of the fair garden, all beseen  
With glittering hair.  
  
                              Then as he knelt,  
Unseeing, suddenly he felt  
   Upon his mouth a burning kiss,  
   That with such sharp unearthly bliss  
His soul did kindle into flame  
Of ravishment, the wayworn frame  
   Could not for frailty sustain  
   The rapturous ecstatic pain  
Of that strange joyance, nor the spright  
Embodied, 'gainst the fierce delight  
   Endure of that unearthly boon;  
   And so for bliss he fell aswoon,  
And heard therein a great sweet voice,  
That bade him fear not, but rejoice,  
   For Christ the Lord his lips had kiss'd;  
   And therewithal the Eucharist  
Was borne into his mouth, with sound  
Of harps angelic all around  
   Soft-smitten; nor therefore did break  
   His charmèd sleep.  
  
                              Then did one speak  
To him as in the trance he lay,  
And with a murmurous voice did say,  
   That for the service of that Lord,  
   To whom was sacred now his sword,  
It was ordain'd that for a space  
He should return unto his place  
   Upon the earth, and in all things  
   That life on earth to mortals brings,  
Should for his Master's honour strive,  
Until the order'd time arrive  
   When God should set him free from soil  
   And weariness of earthly toil.  
And there was given him a sign  
When it should please the Lord Divine  
   To make His will beneficent  
   Patent to him,--there should be sent,  
Twice more before the period set  
For his release from earthly fret,  
   To him the self-same silver dove,  
   The holy symbol of the love  
Of Christ and of His chivalry.  
And it was told him that when he  
   Of the white messenger had wit,  
   He should leave all and follow it:  
For when it should of him be seen  
Anew, as it of late had been,  
   He should be ware that God had need  
   Of him elsewhere--in very deed--  
Upon the earth, and will'd essay  
His service yet within the way  
   Of living: but what time he heard  
   The thrice-said summons, and the bird  
Miraculous unto him came  
A third time, in the holy name,--  
   He should, in following, be freed  
   From toil and labour and the need  
And weariness of day and night,  
And from the knowledge and the sight  
   Of men be ravish'd, to abide  
   In that fair town beatified,  
And serve the Grail, till it seem'd fit  
Unto the Lord that he should sit  
   Among the blest in Paradise  
   And praise Him ever.  
  
                              In this wise  
It seem'd to Floris that one spoke  
To him with soft sweet speech, that broke  
   His slumber not, as he did lie  
   In that long swoon; and, suddenly,  
The murmur of the speech forsook  
His hearing wholly; nor with look  
   Or ears awhile was anything  
   Apparent to him, that could bring  
The wonders of the holy town  
Back to his senses; but the brown  
   And fleecy-plumaged wings of sleep  
   Inclosed him wholly. In a deep  
And senseless dream awhile he lay,  
Until it seem'd to him the gray  
   Of night that compass'd him about  
   Was by a radiance from without  
Transmicate, and the fluted song  
Of the gold merle again was strong  
   Upon his hearing. Then the dim  
   Gray webs of slumber were from him  
Unfolded slowly, and there burst  
A golden light on him. At first  
   The drowsy cumber on his eyes  
   Allow'd him not to recognize  
The place wherein he was, nor know  
Wherefrom the amber-colour'd glow  
   Of light was borne: but speedily  
   He was aware that he did lie  
Upon his bed, and through the fold  
Of silken tapestries the gold  
   Of the young sun upon his face  
   Was shed; and past the window-space,  
Without the casement, could he see,--  
Snow-pure against brown stem and tree,--  
   The charmèd flowerage of that thorn  
   That ever on the Christmas morn  
Is--for a memory and delight  
Of the Lord's birth--with blossoms white  
   Transfigurate. And on a spray  
   There sat a mavis brown and grey,  
That sang as if his heart were shed  
Into his minstrelsy and fled  
   On wings of music heavenward,  
   A sacrifice of song outpour'd  
To God most high.  
  
                              Awhile it seem'd  
To Floris he had surely dream'd  
   The coming of the dove to him  
   And all his strife against the grim  
Fierce beasts, and all the after-bliss  
And wonderment, and Christ His kiss.  
   But looking closelier, he was ware  
   At bed-head of his helm that bare  
A silver dove with eyes of gold,  
That on the crest did sit and fold  
   White wings above it; and he knew  
   The holy semblant on the blue  
Of his fair shield, and eke the blade  
Celestial, by his harness laid  
   Naked at bedfood. So the doubt  
   Was from his spirit blotted out;  
And he was surely certified  
That verily he did abide  
   That wondrous venture, and had known  
   Awhile the glories that alone  
For those that many a toil have dared  
In Christ His service, are prepared  
   Within the city of the Grail,  
   Wherein is neither pain nor wail,  
But ever holiness and peace  
And ravishment without surcease,  
   In very perfectness of rest.  
  
               \* \* \* \*  
  
   So hath Sir Floris found his quest;  
And so the tale is told and done,  
Of how, before life's rest was won,  
   The first time unto Floris came  
   The holy dove, in Lord Christ's name.
