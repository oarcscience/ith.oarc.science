align="center">by</h3>  <h2 align="CENTER"> ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON </h2>  </center>  <br>  <br> 	     Part I.<br> <br> <br> On either side the river lie<br> Long fields of barley and of rye,<br> That clothe the wold and meet the sky;<br> And thro' the field the road runs by<br> 	  To many-tower'd Camelot;<br> And up and down the people go,<br> Gazing where the lilies blow<br> Round an island there below,<br> 	  The island of Shalott.<br> <br> Willows whiten, aspens quiver,<br> Little breezes dusk and shiver<br> Thro' the wave that runs for ever<br> By the island in the river<br> 	  Flowing down to Camelot.<br> Four gray walls, and four gray towers,<br> Overlook a space of flowers,<br> And the silent isle imbowers<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> By the margin, willow-veil'd<br> Slide the heavy barges trail'd<br> By slow horses; and unhail'd<br> The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd<br> 	  Skimming down to Camelot:<br> But who hath seen her wave her hand?<br> Or at the casement seen her stand?<br> Or is she known in all the land,<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott?<br> <br> Only reapers, reaping early<br> In among the bearded barley,<br> Hear a song that echoes cheerly<br> From the river winding clearly,<br> 	  Down to tower'd Camelot:<br> And by the moon the reaper weary,<br> Piling sheaves in uplands airy,<br> Listening, whispers "'Tis the fairy<br> 	  Lady of Shalott."<br> <br> <br> 	     Part II.<br> <br> There she weaves by night and day<br> A magic web with colours gay.<br> She has heard a whisper say,<br> A curse is on her if she stay<br> 	  To look down to Camelot.<br> She knows not what the curse may be,<br> And so she weaveth steadily,<br> And little other care hath she,<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> And moving thro' a mirror clear<br> That hangs before her all the year,<br> Shadows of the world appear.<br> There she sees the highway near<br> 	  Winding down to Camelot:<br> There the river eddy whirls,<br> And there the surly village-churls,<br> And the red cloaks of market girls,<br> 	  Pass onward from Shalott.<br> <br> Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,<br> An abbot on an ambling pad,<br> Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,<br> Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,<br> 	  Goes by to tower'd Camelot;<br> And sometimes thro' the mirror blue<br> The knights come riding two and two:<br> She hath no loyal knight and true,<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> But in her web she still delights<br> To weave the mirror's magic sights,<br> For often thro' the silent nights<br> A funeral, with plumes and lights<br> 	  And music, went to Camelot:<br> Or when the moon was overhead,<br> Came two young lovers lately wed;<br> "I am half-sick of shadows," said<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> <br> 	     Part III.<br> <br> A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,<br> He rode between the barley-sheaves,<br> The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,<br> And flamed upon the brazen greaves<br> 	  Of bold Sir Lancelot.<br> A redcross knight for ever kneel'd<br> To a lady in his shield,<br> That sparkled on the yellow field,<br> 	  Beside remote Shalott.<br> <br> The gemmy bridle glitter'd free,<br> Like to some branch of stars we see<br> Hung in the golden Galaxy.<br> The bridle-bells rang merrily<br> 	  As he rode down to Camelot:<br> And from his blazon'd baldric slung<br> A mighty silver bugle hung,<br> And as he rode his armour rung,<br> 	  Beside remote Shalott.<br> <br> All in the blue unclouded weather<br> Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,<br> The helmet and the helmet-feather<br> Burn'd like one burning flame together,<br> 	  As he rode down to Camelot.<br> As often thro' the purple night,<br> Below the starry clusters bright,<br> Some bearded meteor, trailing light,<br> 	  Moves over still Shalott.<br> <br> His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;<br> On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;<br> From underneath his helmet flow'd<br> His coal-black curls as on he rode,<br> 	  As he rode down to Camelot.<br> From the bank and from the river<br> He flash'd into the crystal mirror,<br> "Tirra lirra," by the river<br> 	  Sang Sir Lancelot.<br> <br> She left the web, she left the loom,<br> She made three paces thro' the room,<br> She saw the water-lily bloom,<br> She saw the helmet and the plume,<br> 	  She look'd down to Camelot.<br> Out flew the web and floated wide;<br> The mirror crack'd from side to side;<br> "The curse is come upon me," cried<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> <br> 	     Part IV.<br> <br> In the stormy east-wind straining,<br> The pale-yellow woods were waning,<br> The broad stream in his banks complaining,<br> Heavily the low sky raining<br> 	  Over tower'd Camelot;<br> Down she came and found a boat<br> Beneath a willow left afloat,<br> And round about the prow she wrote<br> 	  <i> The Lady of Shalott</i> .<br> <br> And down the river's dim expanse--<br> Like some bold se&euml;r in a trance,<br> Seeing all his own mischance--<br> With a glassy countenance<br> 	  Did she look to Camelot.<br> And at the closing of the day<br> She loosed the chain, and down she lay;<br> The broad stream bore her far away,<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> Lying, robed in snowy white<br> That loosely flew to left and right--<br> The leaves upon her falling light--<br> Thro' the noises of the night<br> 	  She floated down to Camelot:<br> And as the boat-head wound along<br> The willowy hills and fields among,<br> They heard her singing her last song,<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> Heard a carol, mournful, holy,<br> Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,<br> Till her blood was frozen slowly,<br> And her eyes were darken'd wholly,<br> 	  Turn'd to tower'd Camelot;<br> For ere she reach'd upon the tide<br> The first house by the water-side,<br> Singing in her song she died,<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott.<br> <br> Under tower and balcony,<br> By garden-wall and gallery,<br> A gleaming shape she floated by,<br> A corse between the houses high,<br> 	  Silent into Camelot.<br> Out upon the wharfs they came,<br> Knight and burgher, lord and dame,<br> And round the prow they read her name,<br> 	  <i> The Lady of Shalott</i> .<br> <br> Who is this? and what is here?<br> And in the lighted palace near<br> Died the sound of royal cheer;<br> And they cross'd themselves for fear,<br> 	  All the knights at Camelot:<br> But Lancelot mused a little space;<br> He said, "She has a lovely face;<br> God in his mercy lend her grace,<br> 	  The Lady of Shalott."
