The cause whereof she delivered by speech as followeth:--<br>  <br>  <br> Of conquest (gracious queen) the signs and fruits,<br> Achieved 'gainst such as wrongfully withheld<br> The service by choice wits to Muses due,<br> In humblest wise these captives we present.<br> And lest your highness might suspect the gift, <br> As spoil of war that justice might impeach,<br> Hear and discern how just our quarrel was, <br> Avouched (as you see) by good success.<br> A dame there is, whom men Astroea term,<br> She that pronounceth oracles of laws,<br> Who to prepare fit servants for her train,<br> As by commission, takes up flow'ring wits,<br> Whom first she schooleth to forget and scorn<br> The noble skills of language and of arts,<br> The wisdom which discourse of stories teach:<br> The ornaments which various knowledge yields.<br> But poesy she hath in most disdain,<br> And marshals it next Folly's scorned place.<br> Then, when she hath these worthy prints defac'd<br> Out of the minds that can endure her hand.<br> What doth she then supply instead of these?<br> Forsooth, some old reports of altered laws,<br> Clamours of courts, and cavils upon words,<br> Grounds without ground, supported by conceit,<br> And reasons of more subtlety than sense.<br> What shall I say of moot points strange, and doubts<br> Still argued, but never yet agreed?<br> And she that doth deride the poet's law,<br> Because he must his words in order place,<br> Forgets her forms of pleading, more precise--<br> More bound to words than is the poet's lore:<br> And for these fine conceits she fitly chose<br> A tongue that barbarism itself doth use.<br> We, noting all these wrongs, did long expect<br> Their hard condition would have made them wise,<br> To offer us their service, plac'd so ill;<br> But finding them addicted to their choice,<br> And specially desirous to present<br> Your Majesty with fruits of province new,<br> Now did resolve to double force and skill,<br> And found and us'd the vantage of the time,<br> Surpris'd their fort, and took them captives all.<br> So now submiss, as to their state belongs,<br> They gladly yield their homage long withdrawn,<br> And Poetry, which they did most contemn,<br> They glory now her favours for to wear.<br> My sisters laugh'd to see them take the pen,<br> And lose their wits all in unwonted walks:<br> But to your highness that delight we leave,<br> To see these poets new their style advance.  <br> Such as they are, or nought or little worth,<br> Deign to accept, and therewith we beseech,<br> That novelty give price to worthless things.<br> <br> <i> Unto this speech one of the Gentlemen answered<br> as followeth:</i> <br> <br> Good ladies, unacquaint with cunning reach,<br> And eas'ly led to glory in your pow'r,<br> Hear now abash'd our late dissembled minds.<br> Nor now the first time, as yourselves best know,<br> Ye Muses sought our service to command:<br> Oft have ye wandered from Parnassus Hill,<br> And

perfections we do more admire<br> Than all the vaunted store of Muses' gifts,<br> Let this be one (which last you put in ure<br> In well depraving that deserveth praise)<br> No eloquence, disguising reason's shape,<br> Nor poetry, each vain affection's nurse,<br> No various history, that doth lead the mind<br> Abroad to ancient tales from instant use,<br> Nor these, nor other mo, too long to note,<br> Can win Astrea's servants to remove<br> Their service once devote to better things.<br> They, with attentive minds and serious wits,<br> Revolve records of deep judicial acts;<br> They weigh with steady and indifferent hand<br> Each word of law, each circumstance of right;<br> They hold the grounds which time and use hath sooth'd,<br> Though shallow sense conceive them as conceits--<br> Presumptuous sense, whose ignorance dare judge<br> Of things remov'd by reason from her reach.<br> One doubt, in moots by argument increas'd,<br> Clears many doubts experience doth object.<br> The

of tongues:<br> That slander envious ignorance did raise.<br> With Muses still we intercourse allow,<br> T'enrich our state with all their foreign freight;<br> But never homage nor acknowledgment,<br> Such as of subjects allegiance doth require.<br> Now hear the cause of your late conquest won.<br> We had discovered your intent to be<br> (And, sure, ye ladies are not secret all;<br> Speech and not silence is the Muse's grace)<br> We well perceiv'd (I say) your mind to be<br> T'employ such prisoners, as themselves did yield,<br> To serve a Queen, for whom her purest gold<br> Nature refin'd, that she might therein set<br> Both private and imperial virtues all.<br> Thus (Sovereign Lady of our laws and us)<br> Zeal may transform us into any shape.<br> We, which with trembling hand the pen did guide,<br> Never well pleas'd, all for desire to please;<br> For still your rare perfections did occur,<br> Which are admir'd of Muses and of men.<br> O, with how steady hand and heart assur'd, <br> Should we take up the warlike lance or sword,<br> With mind resolv'd to spend our loyal blood<br> Your least command with speed to execute!<br> O, that before our time the fleeting ship<br> Ne'er wandered had in watery wilderness,<br> That we might first that venture undertake<br> In strange attempt t'approve our loyal hearts!<br> Be it soldiers, seamen, poets, or what else,<br> In service once enjoin'd, to ready minds<br> Our want of use should our devoir increase.<br> Now since instead of art we bring but zeal,<br> Instead of praise we humbly pardon crave.<br> The matter which we purpose to present,<br> Since straights of time our liberty controls,<br> In tragic notes the plagues of vice recounts.<br> How suits  a tragedy for such a time?<br> Thus--for that since your sacred Majesty<br> In gracious hands the regal sceptre held,<br> All tragedies are fled from State to stage.<br> <br> 	NICHOLAS TROTTE.<br>  The misfortunes of Arthur (Uther Pendragon's son) reduced into tragical notes by Thomas Hughes, one of the society of Gray's Inn, and here set down as it passed from under his hands, and as it was presented, excepting certain words and lines, where some of the actors either helped their memories by brief omission, or fitted their acting by some alteration;  with a note in the end of such speeches as were penned by others, in lieu of some of these hereafter following.
<p>   <center><i> The Argument of the Tragedy.</i> </center>   	At a banquet made by Uther Pendragon for the solemnising of his conquest against the Saxons, he fell enamoured of Igerna, wife to Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall who, perceiving the king's passion, departed with his wife and prepared wars at Cornwall, where also, in a stronghold beyond him, he placed her.  Then the king levied an army to suppress him, but waxing impatient of his desire to Igerna, transformed himself, by Merlin his cunning, into the likeness of Gorlois, and after his acceptance with Igerna he returned to his siege, where he slew Gorlois.  Igerna was delivered of Arthur and Anne, twins of the same birth.  Uther Pendragon, fifteen years after, pursuing the Saxons, was by them poisoned.  Arthur delighted in his sister Anne, who made him father of Mordred.  Seventeen years after, Lucius Tiberius of Rome demanded a tribute, due by conquest of C&aelig;sar.  Arthur gathered his powers of thirteen kings besides his own, and leaving his queen Guenevera in the tuition of Mordred, to whom likewise he committed the kingdom in his absence, arrived at France where, after nine years' wars, he sent the slain body of Tiberius unto Rome for the tribute.  During this absence, Mordred grew ambitious, for th'effecting whereof he made love to Guenevera, who gave ear unto him.  Then by th'assistance of Gilla, a British lord, he usurped, and for maintenance entertained with large promises the Saxons, Irish, Picts, and Normans.  Guenevera hearing that Arthur was already embarked for return, through despair purposing diversely, sometimes to kill her husband, sometimes to kill herself, at last resolved to enter into religion.  Arthur at his landing was resisted on the strands of Dover, where he put Mordred to flight.  The last field was fought at Cornwall where, after the death of one hundred and twenty thousand, saving on either side twenty, Mordred received his death, and Arthur his deadly wound.
<p>   <center><i> The Argument and Manner of the First Dumb-Show.</i> </center>   Sounding the music, there rose three furies from under the stage, apparelled accordingly with snakes and flames about their black hair and garments.  The first with a snake in the right hand, and a cup of wine, with a snake athwart the cup, in the left hand.  The second with a firebrand in the right hand, and a Cupid in the left.  The third with a whip in the right hand and a Pegasus in the left.  While they went masking about the stage, there came from another place three nuns, which walked by themselves.  Then after a full sight given to the beholders, they all parted, the furies to Mordred's house, the nuns to the cloister.  By the first fury with the snake and cup was signified the banquet of Uther Pendragon, and afterward his death, which ensued by the poisoned cup.  The second fury, with her firebrand and Cupid, represented Uther's unlawful heat and love conceived at the banquet, which never ceased in his posterity.  By the third, with her whip and Pegasus, was prefigured the cruelty and ambition which thence ensued and continued to th'effecting of this tragedy.  By the nuns was signified the remorse and despair of Guenevera that, wanting other hope, took a nunnery for her refuge.  After their departure, the four which represented the Chorus took their places.
<p>   <center><i> The Argument of the First Act.</i> </center>   1.  In the first scene the spirit of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, the man first and most wronged in this history, being despoil'd both of wife, dukedom, and life, craveth revenge for these injuries, denouncing the whole misfortune ensuing.<br>  2.  In the second scene Guenevera, hearing that Arthur was on the seas returning desperately, menaceth his death, from which intent she is dissuaded by Fronia, a lady of her court, and privy to her secrets.<br>  3.  In the third scene Guenevera perplexedly mindeth her own death, whence being dissuaded by her sister, she resolveth to enter into religion.<br>  4.  In the fourth scene Mordred goeth about to persuade Guenevera to persist in her love, but misseth thereof;  and then is exhorted by Conan (a nobleman of Britain) to reconcile himself to his father at his coming, but refuseth so to do, and resolveth to keep him from landing by battle.

Why shunn'st thou fearful wrath?<br> Add coals afresh:  preserve me to this venge,<br> At least exile thyself to realms unknown,<br> And steal his wealth to help thy banish'd state;<br> For flight is best.  O base and heartless fear!<br> Theft?  Exile?  Flight?  all these may fortune send<br> Unsought;  but thee beseems more high revenge.<br> Come, spiteful fiends, come, heaps of furies fell,<br> Not one by one, but all at once!  my breast<br> Raves not enough:  it likes me to be fill'd<br> With greater monsters yet.  My heart doth throb,<br> My liver boils:  somewhat my mind portends,<br> Uncertain what, but whatsoever, it's huge.<br> So it exceed, be what it will, it's well.<br> Omit no plague, and none will be enough:<br> Wrong cannot be reveng'd but by excess.<br> FRONIA.  O, spare this heat!  you yield too much to rage:<br> Y'are too unjust.  Is there no mean in wrong?<br> GUENEVERA.  Wrong claims a mean, when first you offer wrong:<br> The mean is vain when wrong is in revenge.<br> Great harms cannot be hid:  the grief is small,<br> That can receive advice, or rule itself.<br> FRONIA.  Hatred conceal'd doth often hap to hurt,<br> Burt once profess'd, it oft'ner fails revenge.<br> How better tho' wert to repress your ire:<br> A lady's best revenge is to forgive.<br> What mean is in your hate?  how much soe'er<br> You can invent or dare, so much you hate.<br> GUENEVERA.

Eschew it far:  such love impugns the laws.<br> GUENEVERA.  Unlawful love doth like, when lawful loathes.<br> FRONIA.  And is your love of husband quite extinct?<br> GUENEVERA.  The greater flame must needs delay the less:<br> Besides, his sore revenge I greatly fear.<br> FRONIA.  How can you then attempt a fresh offence?<br> GUENEVERA.  Who can appoint a stint to her offence?<br> FRONIA.  But here the greatness of the fact should move.<br> GUENEVERA.  The greater it, the fitter for my grief.<br> FRONIA.  To kill your spouse?<br> GUENEVERA.  A stranger and a foe.<br> FRONIA.  Your liege and king.<br> GUENEVERA.  He wants both realm and crown.<br> FRONIA.  Nature affords not to your sex such strength.<br> GUENEVERA.  Love, anguish, wrath, will soon afford enough.<br> FRONIA.  What rage is this?<br> GUENEVERA.  Such as himself shall rue.<br> FRONIA.  Whom Gods do press enough, will you annoy?<br> GUENEVERA.  Whom Gods do press, they bend; whom man annoys, <br> He breaks.<br> FRONIA.  Your grief is more than his deserts.<br> Each fault requires an equal hate:  be not severe,<br> Where crimes be light.  As you have felt, so grieve.<br> GUENEVERA.  And seems it light to want him nine year space?<br> Then to be spoil'd of one I hold more dear?<br> Think all too much, b' it ne'er so just, that feeds<br> Continual grief:  the lasting woe is worst.<br> FRONIA.  Yet let your highness shun these desperate moods:<br> Cast off this rage and fell-disposed mind.<br> Put not shame quite to flight:  have some regard<br> Both of your sex and future fame of life.<br> Use no such cruel thoughts, as far exceed<br> A manly mind, much more a woman's heart.<br> GUENEVERA.  Well, shame is not so quite exil'd, but that<br> I can and will respect your sage advice.<br> Your counsel I accept:  give leave a while,<br> Till fiery wrath may slake, and rage relent.<br> [<i> Exit Fronia.</i> <br> <br> 		<b> THE THIRD SCENE.</b> <br> <br> 	      GUENEVERA, ANGHARAT.<br> <br> GUENEVERA.

Her breast, not yet appeas'd from former rage,<br> Hath chang'd her wrath which, wanting means to work<br> Another's woe (for such is fury's wont),<br> Seeks out his own, and raves upon itself.<br> Assuage (alas) that over fervent ire:<br> Through too much anger you offend too much.<br> Thereby the rather you deserve to live<br> For seeming worthy in yourself to die.<br> GUENEVERA.  Death is decreed;  what kind of death, I doubt:<br> Whether to drown or stifle up this breath,<br> Or forcing blood to die with dint of knife.<br> All hope of prosperous hap is gone.

It must be heal'd by death.<br> ANGHARAT.  No mischief must be done while I be by;<br> Or, if there must, there must be more than one.<br> If death it be you seek, I seek it too;<br> Alone you may not die, with me you may.<br> GUENEVERA.

But will my tears and mournings move you nought?<br> GUENEVERA.  Then it is best to die when friends do mourn.<br> ANGHARAT.  Each-where is death!  the fates have well ordain'd,<br> That each man may bereave himself of life,<br> But none of death:  death is so sure a doom,<br> A thousand ways do guide us to our graves.<br> Who then can ever come too late to that,<br> Whence, when he is come, he never can return?<br> Or what avails to hasten on our ends,<br> And long for that which destinies have sworn!<br> Look back in time:  too late is to repent,<br> When furious rage hath once cut off the choice.<br> GUENEVERA.  Death is an end of pain, no pain itself.<br> Is 'it meet a plague for such excessive wrong.<br> Should be so short?  Should one stroke answer all?<br> [<i> Soliloquizes</i> ]  And would'st thou die?  well, that contents the laws:<br> What, then, for Arthur's ire?  What for thy fame,<br> Which thou hast stain'd?  What for thy stock thou sham'st?<br> Not death nor life alone can give a full<br> Revenge:  join both in one--die and yet live.<br> Where pain may not be oft, let it be long.<br> Seek out some lingering death, whereby thy corpse<br> May neither touch the dead nor joy the quick.<br> Die, but no common death:  pass nature's bounds.<br> ANGHARAT.  Set plaints aside, despair yields no relief;<br> The more you search a wound the more it stings.<br> GUENEVERA.  When guilty minds torment themselves, they heal,<br> Whiles wounds be cur'd, grief is a salve for grief.<br> ANGHARAT.  Grief is no just esteemer of our deeds.<br> What so hath yet been done, proceeds from chance.<br> GUENEVERA.  The mind and not the chance doth make th' unchaste.<br> ANGHARAT.  Then is your fault from fate;  you rest excus'd.<br> None can be deemed faulty for her fate.<br> GUENEVERA.  No fate, but manners fail, when we offend.<br> Impute mishaps to fates, to manners faults.<br> ANGHARAT.  Love is an error that may blind the best.<br> GUENEVERA.  A mighty error oft hath seem'd a sin.<br> My death is vowed, and death must needs take place.<br> But such a death as stands with just remorse:<br> Death to the world and to her slippery joys:  <br> A full divorce from all this courtly pomp,<br> Where daily penance, done for each offence,<br> May render due revenge for every wrong.<br> Which to accomplish, pray my dearest friends,<br> That they forthwith, attir'd in saddest guise,<br> Conduct me to the cloister next hereby,<br> There to profess, and to renounce the world.<br> ANGHARAT.  Alas!  what change were that!  from kingly roofs<br> To cloistered cells--to live and die at once!<br> To want your stately troops, your friends and kin,<br> To shun the shows and sights of stately court;<br> To see in sort alive your country's death.<br> Yea, whatsoe'er even death itself withdraws<br> From any else, that life withdraws from you.<br> Yet since your highness is so fully bent,<br> I will obey:  the whiles assuage your grief.

<p>   <center><i> The Argument and Manner of the Second Dumb-Show</i> </center>   Whiles the music sounded, there came out of Mordred's house a man stately attired, representing a king who, walking once about the stage, then out of the house appointed for Arthur there came three Nymphs apparelled accordingly, the first holding a Cornucopia in her hand, the second a golden branch of olive, the third a sheaf of corn.  These orderly, one after another, offered these presents to the king, who scornfully refused:  a second after which there came a man bareheaded, with long black shagged hair down to his shoulders, apparelled with an Irish jacket and shirt, having an Irish dagger by his side, and a dart in his hand.  Who first with a threatening countenance looking about, and then spying the king, did furiously chase and drive him into Mordred's house.  The king represented Mordred;  the three Nymphs with their proffers the treaty of peace, for the which Arthur sent Gawin with an herald unto Mordred, who rejected it:  the Irishman signified Revenge and Fury, which Mordred conceived after his foil on the shores, whereunto Mordred headlong yieldeth himself.

Speak, brother:  what commandment sends our sire?<br> What message do you bring?  My life or death?<br> GAWIN.  A message far unmeet, most needful tho'.<br> The sire commands not where the son rebels:<br> His love descends too deep to wish your death.<br> MORDRED.  And mine ascends too high to wish his life.<br> GAWIN.  Yet thus he off'reth.  Though your faults be great<br> And most disloyal, to his deep abuse,<br> Yet yield yourself, he'll be as prone to grace,<br> As you to ruth--an uncle, sire, and liege.<br> And fitter were your due submission done,<br> Than wrongful wars to reave his right and realm.<br> MORDRED.  It is my fault that he doth want his right:<br> It is his own to vex the realm with wars.<br> GAWIN.  It is his right that he attempts to seek:<br> It is your wrong that driveth him thereto.<br> MORDRED.  'Tis his insatiate mind, that is not so content,<br> Which hath so many kingdoms more besides.<br> GAWIN.  The more you ought to tremble at his pow'r.<br> MORDRED.  The greater is my conquest, if I win.<br> GAWIN.  The more your foil, if you should hap to lose:<br> For Arthur's fame and valour's such, as you<br> Should rather imitate, or at the least<br> Envy, if hope of better fancies fail'd:<br> For whereas envy reigns, though it repines,<br> Yet doth it fear a greater than itself.<br> MORDRED.  He that envies the valour of his foe,<br> Detects a want of valour in himself.<br> He fondly fights that fights with such a foe,<br> Where 'twere a shame to lose, no praise to win;<br> But with a famous foe succeed what will,<br> To win is great renown, to lose less foil.<br> His conquests, were they more, dismay me not:<br> That oft'ner they have been, the more they threat:<br> No danger can be thought both safe and oft;<br> And who hath oft'ner waged wars than he?<br> Escapes secure him not:  he owes the price:<br> Whom chance hath often miss'd, chance hits at length;<br> Or if that chance have furthered his success,<br> So may she mine, for chance hath made me king.<br> GAWIN.  As chance hath made you king, so chance may change.<br> Provide for peace:  that's it the highest peers,<br> No state except, even conquerers, ought to seek.<br> Remember Arthur's strength, his conquests late,<br> His fiery mind, his high-aspiring heart.<br> Mark then the odds:  he expert, you untried;<br> He ripe, you green.  Yield you, whiles yet you may;<br> He will not yield:  he wins his peace with wars.<br> MORDRED.  If chance may change, his chance was last to win;<br> The likelier now to lose.  His haughty heart<br> And mind I know:  I feel mine own no less.<br> As for his strength and skill, I leave to hap:<br> Where many meet, it lies not all in one.<br> What though he vanquish'd have the Roman troops,<br> That boots him not:  himself is vanquish'd here.<br> Then weigh your words again:  if conquerors ought<br> To seek for peace, the conquered must perforce.<br> But he'll not yield;  he'll purchase peace with wars.<br> Well, yield that will;  I neither will nor can.<br> Come peace, come wars, choose him;  my danger's his,<br> His safety mine:  our states do stand alike.<br> If peace be good, as good for him as me;<br> If wars be good, as good for me as him.<br> GAWIN.  What cursed wars (alas) were those, wherein<br> Both son and sire should so oppose themselves!<br> Him whom you now, unhappy man, pursue,<br> If you should win, yourself would first bewail.<br> Give him his crown:  to keep it peril breeds.<br> MORDRED.  The crown I'll keep myself, ensue what will.<br> Death must be once;  how soon, I least respect.<br> He best provides that can beware in time,<br> Not why nor when, but whence and where he falls.<br> What fool, to live a year or twain in rest,<br> Would lose the state and honour of a crown?<br> GAWIN.  Consider then your father's grief and want,<br> Whom you bereave of kingdom, realm, and crown.<br> MORDRED.  Trust me, a huge and mighty kingdom 'tis<br> To bear the want of kingdom, realm, and crown.<br> GAWIN.  A common want, which works each worlding's woe:<br> That many have too much, but none enough.<br> It were his praise could he be so content,<br> Which makes you guilty of the greater wrong.<br> Wherefore think on the doubtful state of wars.<br> Where Mars hath sway, he keeps no certain course:<br> Sometimes she lets the weaker to prevail,<br> Sometimes the stronger troops:  hope, fear, and rage<br> With eyeless lot rules all uncertain good,<br> Most certain harms be his assured haps.<br> No luck can last;  now here, now there it lights:<br> No state alike, chance blindly snatcheth all,<br> And fortune maketh guilty whom she lists.<br> MORDRED.  Since therefore fear and hope, and hap in wars,<br> Be all obscure, till their success be seen,<br> Your speech doth rather drive me on to try,<br> And trust them all, mine only refuge now.<br> GAWIN.  And fear you not so strange and uncouth wars?<br> MORDRED.  No, were they wars that grew from out the ground!<br> GAWIN.  Nor yet your sire so huge, yourself so small?<br> MORDRED.  The smallest axe may fell the hugest oak.<br> GAWIN.  Nor that, in felling him, yourself may fall?<br> MORDRED.   He falleth well, that falling fells his foe.<br> GAWIN.  Nor common chance, whereto each man is thrall?<br> MORDRED.  Small manhood were to turn my back to chance.<br> GAWIN.  Nor that, if chance afflict, kings brook it not?<br> MORDRED.  I bear no breast so unprepar'd for harms.<br> Even that I hold the kingliest point of all,<br> To brook afflictions well;  and by how much<br> The more his state and tottering empire sags,<br> To fix so much the faster foot on ground.<br> No fear but doth forejudge, and many fall<br> Into their fate, whiles they do fear their fate.<br> Where courage quails, the fear exceeds the harm:<br> Yea, worse than war itself is fear of war.<br> GAWIN.  War seemeth sweet to such as have not tried;<br> But wisdom wills we should forecast the worse.<br> The end allows the act:  that plot is wise,<br> That knows his means, and least relies on chance.<br> Eschew the course where error lurks;  there grows<br> But grief where pain is spent, no hope to speed.<br> Strive not above your strength;  for where your force<br> Is overmatch'd with your attempts, it faints,<br> And fruitless leaves what bootless it began.<br> MORDRED.  All things are rul'd in constant course:  no fate<br> But is foreset:  the first day leads the last.<br> No wisdom then, but difference in conceit,<br> Which works in many men as many minds.<br> You love the mean, and follow virtue's race:<br> I like the top, and aim at greater bliss.<br> You rest content:  my mind aspires to more.<br> In brief, you fear, I hope;  you doubt, I dare.<br> Since, then, the sagest counsels are but strifes,<br> Where equal wits may wrest each side alike,<br> Let counsel go:  my purpose must proceed.<br> Each likes his course, mine own doth like me best.<br> Wherefore, ere Arthur breathe or gather strength,<br> Assault we him, lest he assault us first.<br> He either must destroy, or be destroy'd:  <br> The mischief's in the midst;  catch he that can.<br> GAWIN.  But will no reason rule that desperate mind?<br> MORDRED.  A fickle mind that every reason rules!<br> I rest resolv'd, and to my sire say thus:--<br> If here he stay but three days to an end,<br> And not forthwith discharge his band and host,<br> 'Tis Mordred's oath, assure himself to die.<br> But if he find his courage so to serve,<br> As for to stand to his defence with force,<br> In Cornwall, if he dare, I'll try it out.<br> GAWIN.

<p>   <center><i> The Argument and Manner of the Third Dumb-Show</i> </center>   During the music after the second act, there came upon the stage two gentlemen attired in a peaceable manner, which brought with them a table, carpet and cloth:  and then having covered the table they furnish it with incense on the one end and banquetting dishes on the other end.  Next there came two gentlemen apparelled like soldiers, with two naked swords in their hands, the which they laid across the table.  Then there came two sumptuously attired and war-like who, spying this preparation, smelled the incense and tasted the banquet.  During the which there came a messenger and delivered certain letters to those that fed on the dainties:  who, after they had well viewed and perused the letters, furiously flung the banquet under feet, and violently snatching the swords unto them, they hastily went their way.  By the two first that brought in the banquet was meant the servants of peace:  by the second two were meant the servants of war:  by the two last were meant Arthur and Cador.  By the Messenger and his letters was meant the defiance from Mordred.
<p>  <br> 	  <b> THE THIRD ACT AND FIRST SCENE</b> <br> <br> 	   ARTHUR, CADOR, HOWELL.<br> <br> ARTHUR.  Is this the welcome that my realm prepares?<br> Be these the thanks I win for all my wars?<br> Thus to forbid me land? to slay my friends?<br> To make their blood distain my country shores?<br> My son (belike), lest that our force should faint<br> For want of wars, prepar'd us wars himself.<br> He thought (perhaps) it mought impair our fame,<br> If none rebell'd, whose foil might praise our power.<br> Is this the fruit of Mordred's forward youth<br> And tender age, discreet beyond his years?<br> O false and guileful life!  O crafty world!<br> How cunningly convey'st thou fraud unseen!<br> Th' ambitious seemeth meek, the wanton chaste;<br> Disguised vice for virtue vaunts itself.<br> Thus (Arthur), thus hath fortune play'd her part,<br> Blind for thy weal, clear-sighted for thy woe.<br> Thy kingdom's gone, thy sphere affords no faith:<br> Thy son rebels:  of all thy wonted pomp<br> No jot is left, and fortune hides her face.<br> No place is left for prosperous plight:  mishaps<br> Have room and ways to run and walk at will.<br> Lo (Cador) both our states, your daughter's trust,<br> My son's respect, our hopes repos'd in both!<br> CADOR.  The time, [O] puissant Prince, permits not now<br> To moan our wrongs, or search each several sore.<br> Since Arthur thus hath ransack'd all abroad,<br> What marvel is 't, if Mordred rave at home?<br> When far and near your wars had worn the world,<br> What wars were left for him but civil wars?<br> All which requires revenge with sword and fire,<br> And to pursue your foes with present force.<br> In just attempts Mars gives a rightful doom.<br> ARTHUR.  Nay, rather (Cador) let them run their race,<br> And leave the heavens revengers of my wrong.<br> Since Britain's prosperous state is thus debas'd<br> In servile sort to Mordred's cursed pride,<br> Let me be thrall, and lead a private life:<br> None can refuse the yoke his country bears.<br> But as for wars, in sooth, my flesh abhors<br> To bid the battle to my proper blood.<br> Great is the love which nature doth inforce<br> From kin to kin, but most from sire to son.<br> HOWELL.  The noble neck disdains the servile yoke:<br> Where rule hath pleas'd, subjection seemeth strange.<br> A king ought always to prefer his realm<br> Before the love he bears to kin or son.<br> Your realm destroy'd is ne'er restor'd again, <br> But time may send you kin and sons enough.<br> ARTHUR.  How hard it is to rule th' aspring mind,<br> And what a kingly point it seems to those,<br> Whose lordly hands the stately sceptre sways,<br> Still to pursue the drift they first decreed,<br> My wonted mind and kingdom lets me know.<br> Think not but, if you drive this hazard on,<br> He desperate will resolve to win or die:<br> Whereof who knows which were the greater guilt,<br> The sire to slay the son, or son the sire?<br> CADOR.  If bloody Mars do so extremely sway,<br> That either son or sire must needs be slain,<br> Give law the choice:  let him die that deserves.<br> Each impotent affection notes a want.<br> No worse a vice than lenity in kings;<br> Remiss indulgence soon undoes a realm.<br> He teacheth how to sin that winks at sins,<br> And bids offend that suffereth an offence.<br> The only hope of leave increaseth crimes,<br> And he that pardoneth one, embold'neth all<br> To break the laws.  Each patience fostereth wrong.<br> But vice severely punish'd faints at foot,<br> And creeps no further off than where it falls.<br> One sour example will prevent more vice<br> Than all the best persuasions in the world.<br> Rough rigour looks out right, and still prevails:<br> Smooth mildness looks too many ways to thrive.<br> Wherefore, since Mordred's crimes have wrong'd the laws<br> In so extreme a sort, as is too strange;<br> Let right and justice rule with rigour's aid,<br> And work his wrack at length, although too late;<br> That damning laws, so damned by the laws,<br> He may receive his deep deserved doom.<br> So let it fare with all that dare the like:<br> Let sword, let fire, let torments be their end.<br> Severity upholds both realm and rule.<br> ARTHUR.  Ah too severe!  far from a father's mind.<br> Compassion is as fit for kings as wrath.<br> Laws must not low'r;  rule oft admitteth ruth.<br> So hate, as if there were yet cause to love:  <br> Take not their lives as foes which may be friends.<br> To spoil my son were to despoil myself:<br> Oft, whiles we seek our foes, we seek our foils.<br> Let's rather seek how to allure his mind<br> With good deserts:  deserts may win the worst.<br> HOWELL.  Where Cato first had saved a thief from death,<br> And after was himself condemn'd to die,<br> When else not one would execute the doom,<br> Who but the thief did undertake the task?<br> If too much bounty work so bad effects<br> In thankless friends, what for a ruthless foe?<br> Let laws have still their course:  the ill dispos'd<br> Grudge at their lives to whom they owe too much.<br> ARTHUR.  But yet where men with reconciled minds<br> Renew their love with recontinued grace,<br> Atonement frames them friends of former foes,<br> And makes the moods of swelling wrath to 'suage.<br> No faster friendship than that grows from grief,<br> When melting minds with mutual ruth relent.<br> How close the severed skin unites again,<br> When salves have smoothly heal'd the former hurts!<br> CADOR.  I never yet saw heart so smoothly heal'd,<br> But that the scar bewray'd the former wound:<br> Yea, where the salve did soonest close the skin,<br> The sore was oft'ner covered up than cur'd:<br> Which festering deep and fill'd within, at last<br> With sudden breach grew greater than at first.<br> What then for minds which have revenging moods,<br> And ne'er forget the cross they forced bear?<br> Whereto if reconcilement come, it makes<br> The t' one secure, while t' other works his will.<br> Atonement seld defeats, but oft defers<br> Revenge:  beware a reconciled foe.<br> ARTHUR.  Well, what avails to linger in this life,<br> Which fortune but reserves for greater grief?<br> This breath draws on but matter of mishap:<br> Death only frees the guitless from annoys.<br> Who so hath felt the force of greedy fates,<br> And 'dur'd the last decree of grisly death,<br> Shall never yield his captive arms to chains,<br> Nor drawn in triumph deck  the victor's pomp.<br> HOWELL.  What mean these words?  Is Arthur forc'd to fear?<br> Is this the fruit of your continual wars,<br> Even from the first remembrance of your youth?<br> ARTHUR.  My youth (I grant) and prime of budding years,<br> Puff'd up with pride and fond desire of praise,<br> Foreweening nought what perils might ensue,<br> Adventured all and raught to will the reins:<br> But now this age requires a sager course,<br> and will, advis'd by harms, to wisdom yields.<br> Those swelling spirits, the self-same cause, which first<br> Set them on gog, even fortune's favours quail'd,<br> And now mine oft'nest scapes do scare me most.<br> I fear the trap whereat I oft have tripp'd:<br> Experience tells me plain that chance is frail,<br> And oft the better past, the worse to come.<br> CADOR.  Resist these doubts:  'tis ill to yield to harms.<br> 'Tis safest then to dare, when most you fear.<br> ARTHUR.  As safe sometimes to fear, when most we dare:<br> A causeless courage gives repentance place.<br> HOWELL.  If fortune fawn.<br> ARTHUR.  Each way on me she frowns:<br> For win I, lose I, both procure my grief.<br> CADOR.  Put case you win, what grief?<br> ARTHUR.  Admit I do, what joy?<br> CADOR.  Then may you rule.<br> ARTHUR.  When I may die.<br> CADOR.  To rule is much.<br> ARTHUR.  Small, if we covet nought.<br> CADOR.  Who covets not a crown?<br> ARTHUR.  He that discerns the sword aloft.<br> CADOR.  That hangeth fast.<br> ARTHUR.  But by a hair.<br> CADOR.  Right holds it up.<br> ARTHUR.  Wrong pulls it down.<br> CADOR.  The Commons help the king.<br> ARTHUR.   They sometimes hurt.<br> CADOR.  At least the Peers.<br> ARTHUR.  Seld, if allegiance want.<br> CADOR. Yet sovereignty.<br> ARTHUR.  Not if subjection fail.<br> CADOR.  Doubt not:  the realm is yours.<br> ARTHUR.  'Twas mine 'till now.<br> CADOR.  And shall be still.<br> ARTHUR.  If Mordred list.<br> CADOR.  'Twere well your crown were won.<br> ARTHUR.  Perhaps 'tis better lost.<br> HOWELL.  The name of rule should move a princely mind.<br> ARTHUR.  Trust me, bad things have often glorious names.<br> HOWELL.  The greatest food that fortune can afford.<br> ARTHUR.  A dangerous good, that wisdom would eschew.<br> HOWELL.  Yet weigh the hearsay of the old renowm.<br> And fame, the wonderer fo the former age,<br> Which still extols the facts of worthiest wights,<br> Preferring no deserts before your deeds.<br> Even she exhorts you to this new attempt,<br> Which left untried your winnings be but loss.<br> ARTHUR.  Small credit will be given of matters past<br> To Fame, the flatterer of the former age.<br> Were all believ'd which antique bruit imports,<br> Yet wisdom weighs the peril join'd to praise.<br> Rare is the fame (mark well all ages gone)<br> Which hath not hurt the house it most enhanc'd.<br> Besides, fame's but a blast that sounds awhile,<br> And quickly stints, and then is quite forgot.<br> Look, whatso'er our virtues have achiev'd,<br> The chaos vast and greedy time devours.  <br> To-day all Europe rings with Arthur's praise:<br> 'Twill be as hush'd as if I ne'er had been.<br> What boots it then to venture life or limb<br> For that which needs ere long we leave or lose?<br> CADOR.  Can blind affection so much blear the wise,<br> Or love of graceless son so witch the sire,<br> That what concerns the honour of a prince,<br> With country's good and subject's just request,<br> Should lightly be contemned by a king?<br> When Lucius sent but for his tribute due,<br> You went with thirteen kings to root him out.<br> Have Romans, for requiring but their own,<br> Abode your nine years' brunts?  Shall Mordred 'scape,<br> That wrong'd you thus in honour, queen, and realm?<br> Were this no cause to stir a king to wrath,<br> Yet should your conquests, late achiev'd 'gainst Rome,<br> Inflame your mind with thirst of full revenge.  <br> ARTHUR.  Indeed, continual wars have chaf'd our minds,<br> And good success hath bred impatient moods.<br> Rome puffs us up, and makes us too--too fierce.<br> There, Britons, there we stand, whence Rome did fall.<br> Thou, Lucius, mak'st me proud, thou heav'st my mind:<br> But what?  shall I esteem a crown ought else<br> Than as a gorgeous crest of easeless helm,<br> Or as some brittle mould of glorious pomp,<br> Or glittering glass which, while it shines, it breaks?<br> All this a sudden chance may dash, and not<br> Perhaps with thirteen kings, or in nine years:<br> All may not find so slow and ling'ring fates.<br> What that my country cries for due remorse,<br> And some relief for long-sustained toils?<br> By seas and lands I daily wrought her wrack,<br> And spareless spent her life on every foe.<br> Each where my soldiers perish'd, whilest I won:<br> Throughout the world my conquest was their spoil.<br> A fair reward for all their deaths, for all<br> Their wars abroad, to give them civil wars!<br> What boots it then, reserv'd from foreign foils,<br> To die at home?  what end of ruthless rage?<br> At least let age and nature, worn to nought,<br> Provide at length their graves with wished groans.<br> Pity their hoary hairs, their feeble fists,<br> Their withered limbs, their strengths consum'd in camp!<br> Must they still end their lives amongst the blades?<br> Rests there no other fate, whilst Arthur reigns?<br> What deem you me?

From another place there came a king crowned, who likewise walked on another part of the stage.  From a third place there came four soldiers all armed who, spying this Lady and King, upon a sudden pursued the Lady, from whom they violently took her child, and flung it against the walls;  she, in mournful sort wringing her hands, passed her way.  Then in like manner they set on the king, tearing his crown from his head, and casting it in pieces under feet, drave him by force away, and so passed themselves over the stage.  By this was meant the fruit of war, which spareth neither man, woman, nor child, with the end of Mordred's usurped crown.
<p>  <br> 		<b> THE FOURTH ACT AND FIRST SCENE.</b> <br> <br> 		     GILDAS, CONAN.<br> <br> GILDAS.  Lord Conan, though I know how hard a thing<br> It is for minds train'd up in princley thrones,<br> To hear of ought  against their humour's course,<br> Yet, sithence who forbiddeth not offence,<br> If well he may, is cause of such offence,<br> I could have wish'd (and blame me not, my lord)<br> Your place and countenance both with son and sire<br> Had more prevail'd on either side, than thus<br> T' have left a crown in danger for a crown<br> Through civil wars, our country's wonted woe:<br> Whereby the kigndom's wound, still fest'ring deep,<br> Sucks up the mischievous humour to the heart.<br> The staggering state of Britain's troubled brains,<br> Headsick and sore encumbered in her crown,<br> With giddy steps runs on a headlong race.<br> Whereto this tempest tends, or where this storm<br> Will break, who knows?  but gods avert the worst!<br> CONAN.  Now surely (Gildas) as my duty stood<br> Indifferent for the best to son and sire,<br> So (I protest), since these occasions grew,<br> That in the depth of my desire to please,<br> I more esteem'd what honest faith requir'd<br> In matters meet for their estates and place,<br> Than how to feed each fond affection, prone<br> To bad effects, whence their disgrace mought grow.<br> And as for Mordred's desperate and disloyal plots,<br> They had been none, or fewer at the least,<br> Had I prevail'd, which Arthur knows right well.<br> But even as counters go sometimes for one,<br> Sometimes for thousands more, sometimes for none:<br> So men in greatest countenance with their king<br> Can work by fit persuasion sometimes much;<br> But sometimes less, and sometimes nought at all.<br> GILDAS.  Well, we that have not spent our time in wars,<br> But bent our course at peace and country's weal,<br> May rather now expect what strange event<br> And chance ensues of these so rare attempts,<br> Than enter to discourse upon their cause,<br> And err as wide in words, as  they in deeds.<br> CONAN.

<p>   <center><i> The Argument and Manner of the Fifth and Last Dumb Show.</i> </center>   Sounding the music, four gentlemen all in black, half-armed, half-unarmed, with black scarfs overthwart their shoulders, should come upon the stage.  The first bearing aloft in the one hand, on the truncheon of a spear, an helmet, an arming sword, a gauntlet, &c., representing the troph&aelig;a:  in the other hand a target, depicted with a man's heart sore-wounded, and the blood gushing out, crowned with a crown imperial and a laurel garland;  thus written in the top:  <i> En totum quod superest</i> --signifying the King of Norway, which spent himself and all his power for Arthur, and of whom there was left nothing but his heart to enjoy the conquest that ensued.  The second bearing, in the one hand, a silver vessel full of gold, pearls, and other jewels, representing the spolia:  in the other hand a target, with an elephant and dragon thereon fiercely combating;  the dragon under the elephant,and sucking, by his extreme heat, the blood from him, is crushed in pieces with the fall of the elephant, so as both die at last;  this written above:  <i> Victor an victus?</i>  representing the King of Denmark, who fell through Mordred's wound, having first with his soldiers destroyed the most of Mordred's army.  The third bearing, in the one hand, a Pyramis with a laurel wreath about it, representing Victory;  in the other hand a target with this device--a man sleeping, a snake drawing near to sting him, a lizard, preventing the snake by fight:  the lizard, being deadly wounded, awaketh the man who, seeing the lizard dying, pusues the snake and kills it;  this written above:  <i> Tibi morimur</i> , signifying Gawin, king of Albany, slain in Arthur's defence by Mordred, whom Arthur afterwards slew.  The fourth bearing, in the one hand, a broken pillar, at the top thereof the crown and sceptre of the vanquished king, both broken asunder, representing the conquest over usurpation;  in the other hand a target, with two cocks painted thereon, the one lying dead, the other with his wings broken, his eyes pecked out, and the blood everywhere gushing forth to the ground;  he standing upon the dead cock and crowing over him, with this emblem in the top:  <i> Qua vici, perdidi</i> , signifying Cador deadly wounded by Gilla, whom he slew.  After these followed a king languishing, in complete harness black, bruised and battered unto him, besprinkled with blood;  on his head a laurel garland, leaning on the shoulders of two heralds in mourning gowns and hoods;  the one in Mars his coat of arms, the other in Arthur's, presenting Arthur victorious, but yet deadly wounded.  There followed a page with a target, whereon was portraited a pelican pecking her blood out of her breast to feed her young ones, through which wound she dieth;  this written in the top:  <i> Qua fovi, perii</i> , signifying Arthur's too much indulgence of Mordred, the cause of his death.  All this represented the dismayed and unfortunate victory of Arthur, which is the matter of the Act ensuing.

O sacred prince!  what sight is this we see?<br> Why have the fates reserved us to these woes?<br> Our only hope, the stay of all our realm,<br> The pillar of our state, thus sore oppress'd!<br> O, would the gods had favour'd us so much,<br> That as we lived partakers of your pains,<br> And likewise joy'd the fruit of your exploits,<br> So having thus bereft our sovereign's bliss,<br> They had with more indifferent doom conjoin'd<br> The subjects' both and sovereign's bane in one!<br> It now (alas) engendereth double grief,<br> To rue your want and to bewail our woes.<br> ARTHUR.  Rue not, my Britons, what my rage hath wrought,<br> But blame your king, that thus hath rent your realm.<br> My meanless moods have made the fates thus fell,<br> And too much anger wrought in me too much:<br> For had impatient ire endured abuse,<br> And yielded where resistance threat'ned spoil,<br> I mought have lived in foreign coasts unfoil'd,<br> And six score thousand men had been unmoan'd!<br> But wrong, incensing wrath to take revenge,<br> Preferred chance before a better choice.<br> SECOND CHORUS.  'Twas Mordred's wrong and too unjust deserts<br> That justly mov'd your highness to such wrath:<br> Your claim requir'd no less than those attempts:<br> Your cause right good was prais'd and pray'd for most.<br> ARTHUR.  I claim'd my crown;  the cause of claim was good,<br> The means to claim it in such sort was bad.<br> Yea, rather than my realm and native soil<br> Should wounded fall, thus bruised with these wars,<br> I should have left both realm and right, and all,<br> Or dur'd the death ordain'd by Mordred's oath.<br> CADOR.  And yet, so far as Mars could bide a mean,<br> You hateless sought the safeguard of them all:<br> Whereto the better cause or badder chance<br> Did draw, you still inclin'd;  preferring oft<br> The weaker side, sometimes for love, sometimes<br> For right (as fortune sway'd), your son, yourself.<br> So pity spar'd what reason sought to spoil,<br> Till all at length with equal spoil was spent.<br> THIRD CHORUS.  Would gods your mind had felt no such remorse,<br> And that your foes had no such favour found!<br> So might your friends have had far friendlier fates,<br> If rebels for their due deserts had died.<br> The wicked's death is safety to the just;<br> To spare the traitors was to spoil the true:<br> Of force he hurts the good that helps the bad.<br> In that you sought your country's gain, 'twas well:<br> In that you shunned not her loss, 'twas hard.<br> Good is the friend that seeks to do us good,<br> A mighty friend that doth prevent our harms.<br> ARTHUR.  Well, so it was;  it cannot be redress'd;<br> The greater is my grief that sees it so.<br> My life (I feel) doth fade, and sorrows flow,<br> The rather that my name is thus extinct;<br> In this respect, so Mordred did succeed,<br> O that myself had fall'n and Mordred liv'd!<br> That having conquer'd all my foes but him,<br> I mought have left you him, that conquer'd me.<br> O heavy, wretched lot!  to be the last <br> That falls!  to view the burial of my realm!<br> Where each man else hath felt his several fate,<br> I only pine, oppress'd with all their fates!<br> FOURTH CHORUS.  Although your highness do sustain such grief,<br> As needs enforceth all your realm to rue,<br> Yet since such ruth affordeth no relief,<br> Let due discretion 'suage each cureless sore,<br> And bear the harms that run without redress.<br> The loss is ours, that lose so rare a prince:<br> You only win, that see your foe here foil'd.<br> [<i> The breathless body of MORDRED in armour, as he fell, is brought upon the stage.</i> <br> ARTHUR.  A causeless foe.  When wars did call me hence,<br> He was in years but young, in wit too old.<br> As virtue shineth most in comeliest wights,<br> When inward gifts are deck'd with outward grace,<br> So did his wit and feature feed that hope,<br> Which falsely train'd me to this woful hap.<br> His mind transformed thus, I cannot choose<br> But long to see what change his face sustains.<br> My blood and kindred, doubled in his birth,<br> Inspires a mix'd and twice-descending love,<br> Which drives my dying veins to wish his view.<br> Unhelm his luckless head, set bare his face,<br> That face which erst pleas'd me and mine too<br> much.<br> FIRST CHORUS.  See (worthiest king) the hope of all your realm,<br> Had not his lust to rule prevented all.<br> ARTHUR.  I see (alas) I see (hide, hide again:<br> O, spare mine eyes!) a witness of my crimes;<br> A fearful vision of my former guilt;<br> A dreadful horror of a future doom,<br> A present gall of mind.  O happy they,<br> Whose spotless lives attain a dreadless death!<br> And thou, O hapless boy!  O spite of fates!<br> (What mought I term thee--nephew, son, or both?)<br> Alas!  how happy should we both have been,<br> If no ambitious thought had vex'd thy head,<br> Nor thou thus striv'd to reave thy father's rule,<br> But stay'd thy time, and not forestall'd us both!<br> CADOR.  The hot-spurr'd youth, that forc'd the forward steeds,<br> Whiles needs he would his father's chariot guide,<br> Neglecting what his sire had said in charge:<br> The fires which first he flung about the poles,<br> Himself at last, most woful wretch, inflam'd.<br> So too much love to hover in the heavens<br> Made him to pay the price of rash attempts.<br> ARTHUR.  What ruth (ah), rent the woful father's heart,<br> That saw himself thus made a sonless sire!<br> Well, since both heavens and hell conspir'd in one<br> To make our ends a mirror to the world,<br> Both of incestuous life and wicked birth,<br> Would gods the fates, that link'd our faults alike,<br> Had also fram'd our minds of friendlier moulds!<br> That as our lineage had approach'd too near,<br> So our affections had not swerv'd too far.<br> Then mought, I['ve] lived t' enlarge the Britons' praise<br> In rearing efts the first triumphant Troy,<br> And after thou, succeeding mine attempts,<br> Have spent thy courage in a juster cause.<br> But 'twould not be:  ambition grew too great;<br> We could not join our minds--our fates we join'd,<br> And through thy blood a way was made to mine.<br> SECOND CHORUS.  And must we needs (O worthiest peers) forego<br> By this untimely fate our greatest hope?<br> That in your ripest years and likeliest time<br> Your chiefest force should on this sudden fall?<br> [THIRD CHORUS.]  See, see our idle hopes, our brittle trust,<br> [FOURTH CHORUS.]  Our vain desires, our over-fickle state<br> Which, though a while they sail on quiet seas,<br> Yet sink in surge, ere they arrive to road.<br> O woful wars!  O Mordred's cursed pride,<br> That thus hath wrought both king and kingdom's woe!<br> CADOR.  Let plaints and mournings pass;  set moans apart.<br> They made much of themselves, yea, too--too much;<br> They lov'd to live that, seeing all their realm<br> Thus topsy-turvy turn, would grudge to die.<br> ARTHUR.  Yea, sure:  since thus (O fates) your censure seems,<br> That free from force of foreign foes, there rests<br> That Mordred reap the glory of our deaths,<br> B' it so:  drive on your doom, work your decree:<br> We fearless bide what bane soe'er you bid.<br> And though our ends, thus hastened to your hests,<br> Abruptly break the course of great attempts,<br> Yet go we not inglorious to the ground:<br> Set wish apart, we have perform'd enough.<br> The Irish king and nation wild we tam'd;<br> The Scots and Picts, and Orcade Isles, we wan;<br> The Danes and Goths, and Friesland men, with all<br> The Isles inserted near those seas;  and next<br> The German king and Saxons we subdu'd.<br> Not France that could prevail against our force, <br> Nor lastly Rome, that rues her pride suppress'd.<br> Each foreign power is parcel of our praise:<br> No titles want to make our foes afraid.<br> This only now I crave (O fortune! erst<br> My faithful friend):  let it be soon forgot,<br> Nor long in mind nor mouth, where Arthur fell:<br> Yea, though I conqueror die, and full of fame,<br> Yet let my death and parture rest obscure.<br> No grave I need (O fates!) Nor burial rights,<br> Nor stately hearse, nor tomb with haughty top;<br> But let my carcase lurk;  yea, let my death<br> Be aye unknowen, so that in every coast<br> I still be fear'd, and look'd for every hour.<br> [<i> Exeunt </i>  ARTHUR <i> and </i>  CADOR.<br> <br> 		      CHORUS.<br> <br> 		  	1.<br> <br> Lo, here the end that fortune sends at last<br> To him, whom first she heav'd to highest hap!<br> The flattering look, wherewith he long was led;<br> The smiling fates, that oft had fed his fame,<br> The many wars and conquests which he gain'd,<br> Are dash'd at once:  One day infers that foil,<br> Whereof so many years of yore were free.<br> <br> 		  	2.<br> <br> O willing world to magnify man's state!<br> O most unwilling to maintain the same!<br> Of all misfortunes and unhappy fates<br> Th' unhappiest seems to have been happy once.<br> 'Twas Arthur sole, that never found his joys<br> Disturb'd with woe, nor woes reliev'd with joy.  <br> In prosperous state all heavenly pow'rs aspir'd;<br> Now, made a wretch, not one that spares his spoil!<br> <br> 		  	3.<br> <br> Yea, fortune's self in this afflicted case<br> Exacts a pain for long-continued pomp.<br> She urgeth now the bliss of wonted weal,<br> And bears him down wiht weight of former fame.<br> His praises past be present shame.

Now, Gorlois, 'suage thyself.

<p>    A speech penned by William Fulbecke, gentleman, one of the society of Gray'sInn, and pronounced instead of Gorlois in his first speech penned by Thomas Hughes, and set down in the first Scene of the first Act.</center>  <br> Alecto, thou that hast excluded me<br> From fields Elysian, where the guiltless souls<br> Avoid the scourge of Rhadamanthus ire,<br> Let it be lawful (sith I am removed<br> From blessed islands to this cursed shore,<br> This loathed earth, where Arthur's table stands,<br> With ordure foul of Harpies' fierce distained)<br> The fates and hidden secrets to disclose<br> Of black Cocytus and of Acheron, <br> The floods of death, the lakes of burning souls,<br> Where hellish frogs do prophesy revenge;  <br> Where Tartar sprites with careful heed attend<br> The dismal summons of Alecto's mouth.<br> Myself by precept of Proserpina<br> Commanded was in presence to appear<br> Before the synod of the damned sprites.<br> In fearful mood I did perform their hest,<br> And, at my entrance in, th' enchanted snakes,<br> Which wrap themselves about the furies' necks,<br> Did hiss for joy:  and from the dreadful bench<br> The supreme fury thus assign'd her charge.<br> Gorlois, quoth she, thou thither must ascend,<br> Whence, through the rancour of malicious foes,<br> Wearied with wounds thou didst descend to us.<br> Make Britain now the mark of thy revenge:<br> On ruthless Britons and Pendragon's race<br> Disburse the treasure of thy hellish plagues.<br> Let blood contend with blood, father with son,<br> Subject with prince, and let confusion reign.<br> She therewithal enjoin'd the dusky clouds,<br> Which with their darkness turn'd the earth to hell,<br> Convert to blood, and pour down streams of blood.<br> Cornwall shall groan, and Arthur's soul shall sigh:<br> Before the conscience of Guenevera<br> The map of hell shall hang, and fiends shall rage;<br> And Gorlois' ghost exacting punishment<br> With dreams, with horrors, and with deadly trance,<br> Shall gripe their hearts:  the vision of his corse<br> Shall be to them, as was the terror vile<br> Of flaming whips to Agamemnon's son.<br> And when the trumpet calls them from their rest,<br> Aurora shall with wat'ry cheeks behold<br> Their slaughtered bodies prostrate to her beams:<br> And on the banks of Camela shall lie<br> The bones of Arthur and of Arthur's knights,<br> Whose fleet is now triumphing on the seas,<br> But shall be welcom'd with a tragedy.<br> Thy native soil shall be thy fatal gulf,<br> Arthur:  thy place of birth thy place of death.<br> Mordred shall be the hammer of my hate<br> To beat the bones of Cornish lords to dust.<br> Ye ravening birds under Celoeno's power,<br> I do adjure you, in Alecto's name, <br> Follow the sword of Mordred where he goes;<br> Follow the sword of Mordred for your food.<br> Aspiring Mordred, thou must also die,<br> And on the altar of Proserpina<br> Thy vital blood unto my ghost shall fume.<br> Heaven, earth, and hell concur to plague the man,<br> That is the plague of heaven, earth, and hell!<br> Thou bidd'st, Alecto:  I pursue my charge.<br> Let thy Cerast&aelig; whistle in mine ears,<br> And let the bells of Pluto ring revenge!<br>  <center>One other speech penned by the same gentleman, and pronounced instead of Gorlois his last speech penned by Thomas Hughes, and set down in the second Scene of the fifth and last Act.</center>  <br> Death hath his conquest, hell hath had his wish,<br> Gorlois his vow, Alecto her desire;<br> Sin hath his pay, and blood is quit with blood:<br> Revenge in triumph bears the struggling hearts!<br> Now, Gorlois, pierce the craggy rocks of hell,<br> Through chinks whereof infernal sprites do glance,<br> Return this answer to the furies' court:<br> That Cornwall trembles with the thought of war,<br> And Tamar's flood with drooping pace doth flow,<br> For fear of touching Camel's bloody stream.<br> Britain, remember;  write it on thy walls,<br> Which neither time nor tyranny may raze,<br> That rebels, traitors, and conspirators,<br> The seminary of lewd Catiline,<br> The bastard covey of Italian birds,<br> Shall feel the flames of ever-flaming fire,<br> Which are not quenched with a sea of tears.<br> And since in thee some glorious star must shine,<br> When many years and ages are expir'd,<br> Whose beams shall clear the mist of miscontent,<br> And make the damp of Pluto's pit retire,<br> Gorlois will never fray the Britons more:<br> For Britain then becomes an angel's land.<br> Both devils and sprites must yield to angels' power,<br> Unto the goddess of the angels' land.<br> Vaunt, Britain, vaunt of her renowmed reign,<br> Whose face deters the hags of hell from thee,<br> Whose virtues hold the plagues of heaven from<br> thee;<br> Whose presence makes the earth fruitful to thee;<br> And with foresight of her thrice-happy days,<br> Britain, I leave thee to an endless praise.<br>  <br>  Besides these speeches there was also penned a Chorus for the first act, and another for the second act, by Master Francis Flower, which were pronounced accordingly.  The dumb shows were partly devised by Master Christopher Yelverton, Master Francis Bacon, Master John Lancaster and others, partly by the said Master Flower, who with Master Penruddock and the said Master Lancaster, directed these proceedings at Court.<br>
