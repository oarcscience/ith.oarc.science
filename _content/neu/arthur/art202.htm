"under high protection,<br>   Though on her prow a sign of heathen power<br>   Was carved--a Goddess with a Lily flower,<br>   The old Egyptian's emblematic mark<br> Of joy immortal and of pure affection.<br> <br>   "Her course was for the British strand,<br>   Her freight it was a Damsel peerless;<br>   God reigns above, and Spirits strong<br>   May gather to avenge this wrong<br>   Done to the Princess, and her Land<br> Which she in duty left, though sad not cheerless.<br> <br>   "And to Caerleon's loftiest tower<br>   Soon will the Knights of Arthur's Table<br>   A cry of lamentation send;<br>   And all will weep who there attend,<br>   To grace that Stranger's bridal hour,<br> For whom the sea was made unnavigable.<br> <br>   "Shame! should a Child of Royal Line<br>   Die through the blindness of thy malice:"<br>   Thus to the Necromancer spake<br>   Nina, the Lady of the Lake,<br>   A gentle Sorceress, and benign,<br> Who ne'er embittered any good man's chalice.<br> <br>   "What boots," continued she, "to mourn?<br>   To expiate thy sin endeavour!<br>   From the bleak isle where she is laid,<br>   Fetched by our art, the Egyptian Maid<br>   May yet to Arthur's court be borne<br> Cold as she is, ere life be fled for ever.<br> <br>   "My pearly Boat, a shining Light,<br>   That brought me down that sunless river,<br>   Will bear me on from wave to wave,<br>   And back with her to this sea-cave;<br>   Then Merlin! for a rapid flight<br> Through air to thee my charge will I deliver.<br> <br>   "The very swiftest of thy Cars<br>   Must, when my part is done, be ready;<br>   Meanwhile, for further guidance, look<br>   Into thy own prophetic book;<br>   And, if that fail, consult the Stars<br> To learn thy course; farewell! be prompt and steady."<br> <br>   This scarcely spoken, she again<br>   Was seated in her gleaming Shallop,<br>   That, o'er the yet-distempered Deep,<br>   Pursued its way with bird-like sweep,<br>   Or like a steed, without a rein,<br> Urged o'er the wilderness in sportive gallop.<br> <br>   Soon did the gentle Nina reach<br>   That Isle without a house or haven;<br>   Landing, she found not what she sought,<br>   Nor saw of wreck or ruin aught<br>   But a carved Lotus cast upon the shore<br> By the fierce waves, a flower in marble graven.<br> <br>   Sad relique, but how fair the while!<br>   For gently each from each retreating<br>   With backward curve, the leaves revealed<br>   The bosom half, and half concealed,<br>   Of a Divinity, that seemed to smile<br> On Nina as she passed, with hopeful greeting.<br> <br>   No quest was hers of vague desire,<br>   Of tortured hope and purpose shaken;<br>   Following the margin of a bay,<br>   She spied the lonely Cast-away,<br>   Unmarred, unstripped of her attire,<br> But with closed eyes,--of breath and bloom forsaken.<br> <br>   Then Nina, stooping down, embraced,<br>   With tenderness and mild emotion,<br>   The Damsel, in that trance embound;<br>   And, while she raised her from the ground,<br>   And in the pearly shallop placed,<br> Sleep fell upon the air, and stilled the ocean.<br> <br>   The turmoil hushed, celestial springs<br>   Of music opened, and there came a blending<br>   Of fragrance, underived from earth,<br>   With gleams that owed not to the Sun their birth,<br>   And that soft rustling of invisible wings<br> Which Angels make, on works of love descending.<br> <br>   And Nina heard a sweeter voice<br>   Than if the Goddess of the Flower had spoken:<br>   "Thou hast achieved, fair Dame! what none<br>   Less pure in spirit could have done;<br>   Go, in thy enterprise rejoice!<br> Air, earth, sea, sky, and heaven, success betoken."<br> <br>   So cheered she left that Island bleak,<br>   A bare rock of the Scilly cluster;<br>   And, as they traversed the smooth brine,<br>   The self-illumined Brigantine<br>   Shed, on the Slumberer's cold wan cheek<br> And pallid brow, a melancholy lustre.<br> <br>   Fleet was their course, and when they came<br>   To the dim cavern, whence the river<br>   Issued into the salt-sea flood,<br>   Merlin, as fixed in thought he stood,<br>   Was thus accosted by the Dame:<br> "Behold to thee my Charge I now deliver!<br> <br>   "But where attends thy chariot--where?"<br>   Quoth Merlin, "Even as I was bidden,<br>   So have I done; as trusty as thy barge<br>   My vehicle shall prove--O precious Charge!<br>   If this be sleep, how soft! if death, how fair!<br> Much have my books disclosed, but the end is hidden."<br> <br>   He spake, and gliding into view<br>   Forth from the grotto's dimmest chamber<br>   Came two mute Swans, whose plumes of dusky white<br>   Changed, as the pair approached the light,<br>   Drawing an ebon car, their hue<br> (Like clouds of sunset) into lucid amber.<br> <br>   Once more did gentle Nina lift<br>   The Princess, passive to all changes:<br>   The car received her; then up-went<br>   Into the ethereal element<br>   The Birds with progress smooth and swift<br> As thought, when through bright regions memory ranges.<br> <br>   Sage Merlin, at the Slumberer's side,<br>   Instructs the Swans their way to measure;<br>   And soon Caerleon's towers appeared,<br>   And notes of minstrelsy were heard<br>   From rich pavilions spreading wide,<br> For some high day of long-expected pleasure.<br> <br>   Awe-stricken stood both Knights and Dames<br>   Ere on firm ground the car alighted;<br>   Eftsoons astonishment was past,<br>   For in that face they saw the last<br>   Last lingering look of clay, that tames<br> All pride, by which all happiness is blighted.<br> <br>   Said Merlin, "Mighty King, fair Lords,<br>   Away with feast and tilt and tourney!<br>   Ye saw, throughout this Royal House,<br>   Ye heard, a rocking marvellous<br>   Of turrets, and a clash of swords<br> Self-shaken, as I closed my airy journey.<br> <br>   "Lo! by a destiny well known<br>   To mortals, joy is turned to sorrow;<br>   This is the wished-for Bride, the Maid<br>   Of Egypt, from a rock conveyed<br>   Where she by shipwreck had been thrown;<br> Ill sight! but grief may vanish ere the morrow."<br> <br>   "Though vast thy power, thy words are weak,"<br>   Exclaimed the King, "a mockery hateful;<br>   Dutiful Child! her lot how hard!<br>   Is this her piety's reward?<br>   Those watery locks, that bloodless cheek!<br> O winds without remorse!  O shore ungrateful!<br> <br>   "Rich robes are fretted by the moth;<br>   Towers, temples, fall by stroke of thunder;<br>   Will that, or deeper thoughts, abate<br>   A Father's sorrow for her fate?<br>   He will repent him of his troth;<br> His brain will burn, his stout heart split asunder.<br> <br>   "Alas! and I have caused this woe;<br>   For, when my prowess from invading Neighbours<br>   Had freed his Realm, he plighted word<br>   That he would turn to Christ our Lord,<br>   And his dear Daughter on a Knight bestow<br> Whom I should choose for love and matchless labours.<br> <br>   "Her birth was heathen, but a fence<br>   Of holy Angels round her hovered;<br>   A Lady added to my court<br>   So fair, of such divine report<br>   And worship, seemed a recompence<br> For fifty kingdoms by my sword recovered.<br> <br>   "Ask not for whom, O champions true!<br>   She was reserved by me her life's betrayer;<br>   She who was meant to be a bride<br>   Is now a corse; then put aside<br>   Vain thoughts, and speed ye, with observance due<br> Of Christian rites, in Christian ground to lay her."<br> <br>   "The tomb," said Merlin, "may not close<br>   Upon her yet, earth hide her beauty;<br>   Not froward to thy sovereign will<br>   Esteem me, Liege! if I, whose skill<br>   Wafted her hither, interpose<br> To check this pious haste of erring duty.<br> <br>   "My books command me to lay bare<br>   The secret thou art bent on keeping;<br>   Here must a high attest be given,<br>   What Bridegroom was for her ordained by Heaven;<br>   And in my glass significants there are<br> Of things that may to gladness turn this weeping.<br> <br>   "For this, approaching, One by One,<br>   Thy Knights must touch the cold hand of the Virgin;<br>   So, for the favoured One, the Flower may bloom<br>   Once more; but, if unchangeagble her doom,<br>   If life departed be for ever gone,<br> Some blest assurance, from this cloud emerging,<br> <br>   May teach him to bewail his loss;<br>   Not with a grief that, like a vapour, rises<br>   And melts; but grief devout that shall endure<br>   And a perpetual growth secure<br>   Of purposes which no false thought shall cross<br> A harvest of high hopes and noble enterprises."<br> <br>   "So be it," said the King;--"anon,<br>   Here, where the Princess lies, begin the trial;<br>   Knights each in order as ye stand<br>   Step forth."--To touch the pallid hand<br>   Sir Agravaine advanced; no sign he won<br> From Heaven or Earth;--Sir Kaye had like denial.<br> <br>   Abashed, Sir Dinas turned away;<br>   Even for Sir Percival was no disclosure;<br>   Though he, devoutest of all Champions, ere<br>   He reached that ebon car, the bier<br>   Whereon diffused like snow the Damsel lay,<br> Full thrice had crossed himself in meek composure.<br> <br>   Imagine (but ye Saints! who can?)<br>   How in still air the balance trembled;<br>   The wishes, peradventure the despites<br>   That overcame some not ungenerous Knights;<br>   And all the thoughts that lengthened out a span<br> Of time to Lords and Ladies thus assembled.<br> <br>   What patient confidence was here!<br>   And there how many bosoms panted!<br>   While drawing toward the Car Sir Gawaine, mailed<br>   For tournament, his Beaver vailed,<br>   And softly touched; but, to his princely cheer<br> And high expectancy, no sign was granted.<br> <br>   Next, disencumbered of his harp,<br>   Sir Tristram, dear to thousands as a brother,<br>   Came to the proof, nor grieved that there ensued<br>   No change;--the fair Izonda he had wooed<br>   With love too true, a love with pangs too sharp,<br> From hope too distant, not to dread another.<br> <br>   Not so Sir Launcelot;--from Heaven's grace<br>   A sign he craved, tired slave of vain contrition;<br>   The royal Guinever looked passing glad<br>   When his touch failed.--Next came Sir Galahad;<br>   He paused, and stood entranced by that still face<br> Whose features he had seen in noontide vision.<br> <br>   For late, as near a murmuring stream<br>   He rested 'mid an arbour green and shady,<br>   Nina, the good Enchantress, shed<br>   A light around his mossy bed;<br>   And, at her call, a waking dream<br> Prefigured to his sense the Egyptian Lady.<br> <br>   Now, while the bright-haired front he bowed,<br>   And stood, far-kenned by mantle furred with ermine,<br>   As o'er the insensate Body hung<br>   The enrapt, the beautiful, the young,<br>   Belief sank deep into the crowd<br> That he the solemn issue would determine.<br> <br>   Nor deem it strange; the Youth had worn<br>   That very mantle on a day of glory,<br>   The day when he achieved that matchless feat,<br>   The marvel of the PERILOUS SEAT,<br>   Which whosoe'er approached of strength was shorn,<br> Though King or Knight the most renowned in story.<br> <br>   He touched with hesitating hand,<br>   And lo! those Birds, far-famed through Love's dominions,<br>   The Swans, in triumph clap their wings;<br>   And their necks play, involved in rings,<br>   Like sinless snakes in Eden's happy land;--<br> "Mine is she," cried the Knight;--again they clapped their pinions.<br> <br>   "Mine was she--mine she is, though dead,<br>   And to her name my soul shall cleave in sorrow;"<br>   Whereat, a tender twilight streak<br>   Of colour dawned upon the Damsel's cheek;<br>   And her lips, quickening with uncertain red,<br> Seemed from each other a faint warmth to borrow<br> <br>   Deep was the awe, the rapture high,<br>   Of love emboldened, hope with dread entwining,<br>   When, to the mouth, relenting Death<br>   Allowed a soft and flower-like breath,<br>   Precursor to a timid sigh,<br> To lifted eyelids, and a doubtful shining.<br> <br>   In silence did King Arthur gaze<br>   Upon the signs that pass away or tarry;<br>   In silence watched the gentle strife<br>   Of Nature leading back to life;<br>   Then eased his Soul at length by praise<br> Of God, and Heaven's pure Queen--the blissful Mary.<br> <br>   Then said he, "Take her to thy heart<br>   Sir Galahad! a treasure that God giveth<br>   Bound by indissoluble ties to thee<br>   Through mortal change and immortality;<br>   Be happy and unenvied, thou who art<br> A goodly Knight that hath no Peer that liveth!"<br> <br>   Not long the Nuptials were delayed;<br>   And sage tradition still rehearses<br>   The pomp the glory of that hour<br>   When toward the Altar from her bower<br>   King Arthur led the Egyptian Maid,<br> And Angels carolled these far-echoed verses;--<br> <br> 	Who shrinks not from alliance<br> 	Of evil with good Powers,<br> 	To God proclaims defiance,<br> 	And mocks whom he adores.<br> <br> 	A Ship to Christ devoted<br> 	From the Land of Nile did go;<br> 	Alas! the bright Ship floated,<br> 	An Idol at her Prow.<br> <br> 	By magic domination<br> 	The Heaven-permitted vent<br> 	Of purblind mortal passion,<br> 	Was wrought her punishment.<br> <br> 	The Flower, the Form within it,<br> 	What served they in her need?<br> 	Her port she could not win it,<br> 	Nor from mishap be freed.<br> <br> 	The tempest overcame her,<br> 	And she was seen no more;<br> 	But gently gently blame her,<br> 	She cast a Pearl ashore.<br> <br> 	The Maid to Jesu hearkened,<br> 	And kept to him her faith,<br> 	Till sense in death was darkened,<br> 	Or sleep akin to death.<br> <br> 	But Angels round her pillow<br> 	Kept watch, a viewless band;<br> 	And, billow favouring billow,<br> 	She reached the destined strand.<br> <br> 	Blest Pair! whate'er befall you,<br> 	Your faith in Him approve<br> 	Who from frail earth can call you,<br> 	To bowers of endless love!<br>
