A wide lake with a rocky path descending to the shore.  As the curtain rises there is a faint glimmer on the horizon, which gradually spreads over the water to an effect of dawn.<br>  </i> <br>  	    CHORUS OF LAKE SPIRITS [<i> singing</i> ].<br> 	Dawn and daytime turn to night,<br> 	Darkness wakes to morning light;<br> 	All the uncounted hours go by<br> 	Swift as clouds across the sky,<br> 	While we maidens of the mere,<br> 	Heedless of the changing year,<br> 	Guard the sword Excalibur.<br> <br> <i> During the concluding bars of the chorus, Arthur, accompanied by Merlin, <br> appears on the summit of the rocky path.</i> <br> <br>   ARTHUR.  What shore is this, haunted by mystic sounds<br> That are not earthly?<br>   MERLIN.            'Tis no earthly shore,<br> Nor, till this hour, have mortal eyes beheld<br> These fairy sands.<br>   ARTHUR.         Then thou shalt go alone;<br> For here, perchance, thy magic arts have power<br> To lure my soul.<br>   MERLIN.       Nay, Arthur, have no fear.<br> A mightier power than mine had led thy feet<br> There where I found thee sleeping by the lake:<br> For whilst I watched a star fell in the sky,<br> And, from the vacant space of Heaven, there came<br> A voice that cried "Awake! the hour hath struck:<br> Now guide him, Merlin, to that caverned home<br> Where dwells the sacred sword Excalibur."<br>   ARTHUR.  What is this sword?<br>   MERLIN.                     Look well and thou shalt see.<br> <br> <i> As he speaks an arm rises from the Lake holding aloft a jewelled sword <br> set in its scabbard, which gleams with supernatural light.</i> <br> <br> <br> <br> 	   CHORUS OF LAKE SPIRITS<br> 	Sword, no mortal shall withstand,<br> 	Fashioned by no mortal hand,<br> 	Long we wait the hour shall bring<br> 	England's sword to England's King;<br> 	  He shall wield Excalibur.<br> <br>   MERLIN.  What think'st thou, Arthur?<br>   ARTHUR.                             Nay, I have no word.<br> Whence comes this sword?<br>   MERLIN.               Long time, ere Time began,<br> 'Twas forged beneath the sea; its glittering blade,<br> Was tempered by the waves; sea-maidens wrought<br> Its jewelled scabbard, and that warrior king,<br> Whose arm is strong to wield it in the fight,<br> Shall rule a kingdom that shall rule the sea.<br>   ARTHUR [<i> musing</i> ]<i> .</i>   For such a sword 'twere well to give the world,<br> With such a sword 'twere well to rule the world.<br> Who is this king?<br>   MERLIN.       Nay, list, and thou shalt hear.<br> <br> 	   CHORUS OF LAKE SPIRITS<br> 	Warrior knight, into thy hand,<br> 	Monarch of a mighty land<br> 	That, in unborn years, shall be<br> 	Monarch of the mightier sea;<br> 	Great Pendragon's son, to thee<br> 	  We shall yield Excalibur.<br> <i> The sword again slowly sinks into the Lake.</i> <br> <br>   ARTHUR.  Who is Pendragon's son?<br>   MERLIN.                         Thou art the man;<br> Pendragon's son, albeit thou know'st it not;<br> For at thy birth I took thee from the Court;<br> Deep in the woods--a flower amid the flowers,--<br> I watched beside thee, heard thine infant tongue<br> First lisp responsive to the woodland birds,<br> And by thy cradle, swung beneath the stars,<br> Taught thee the wisdom that should fit a throne.<br> Now art thou called!  Stand forth and take thy sword<br> Whose might alone can stay these wasting wars,<br> Whose might alone shall bring the realm of peace.<br>   ARTHUR [<i> rising</i> ].  Then was my dream no dream; for while I slept,<br> I heard the noise of battle, and I saw<br> The flashing of innumerable spears<br> Lightening the dark of Heaven; then I rose<br> And rode into the strife, and, where I led,<br> The mightiest fell before me, and men cried,<br> "It is the King."  Yet did I heed them not,<br> For in mine ears there rang a clarion voice<br> Which said, "Nay, stay not till the end is won!<br> Fight on, thine arm is mightier than theirs,<br> Fight on, an unborn empire claims thy sword,<br> Fight on, they strike for glory, thou for peace!"<br> Long time the battle lasted, and the end<br> Seemed afar off; yet at the end it came,<br> And, ere my arm grew weary, I could hear<br> A hush upon the thunder; and the noise<br> And cry of war grew fainter, till it fell<br> To echoing silence.  Then far off I saw,<br> Set in a redd'ning sky of blood and fire,<br> A face most fair that wore an angel smile;<br> And down the unending avenue of spears<br> It drew towards me, seeming as it came<br> Like a white rose leaf borne upon the tide<br> Of crimson war.  Whereat I knelt and said,<br> "I have fought for thee, thou hast the smile of peace;"<br> Yet answer made she none, and I awoke.<br> Ah, thou who know'st the secrets of the stars,<br> Tell me whose face I saw!--<br>   MERLIN.                  Nay, ask not that.<br>   ARTHUR.  I will be answered! all the world to me<br> Dwells in that smile.<br>   MERLIN.            Then look upon thy fate.<br> <i> As he speaks a vision of Guinevere appears.  Arthur kneels.</i> <br>   ARTHUR.  Who art thou?  Speak!<br>   MERLIN.                       Listen, and thou shalt hear.<br> <i> At this a chorus of unseen spirits is heard.</i> <br> 		  CHORUS<br> 	Fairest form of all the earth!<br> 	Joy and sorrow at one birth;<br> 	Love and beauty, hope and fear,<br> 	Wait for thee in Guinevere.<br> <br>   MERLIN.<br> 	Love and beauty, hope and fear,<br> <br> 	Wait for thee in Guinevere.<br> Thou hearest, Arthur?<br>   ARTHUR.            Nay, I do but see<br> A form too fair for this rough world's embrace,<br> Fit for a kingdom that no sword can win;<br> Yet would I win thee, take thee for my Queen.<br> Ah, say she shall be mine!<br>   MERLIN.                 Fate answers thee,<br> Yet in that gift of beauty lurks thy doom.<br> <br> 		ECHOING CHORUS<br> 	Love and beauty, hope and fear,<br> 	Wait for thee in Guinevere.<br> <br>   ARTHUR.  These fairy tongues are false, for, see, she bears<br> The emblems of the spring: all the new world<br> Leaps into flower about her; and the may<br> Trails its white blossom round those stainless brows.<br>   MERLIN.  Yet thou shouldst know full many a poisonous weed<br> Grows rank amid the blossoms of the may.<br> <br> 		  CHORUS<br> 	Love and Hate are born in May;<br> 	Love, the bird upon the wing,<br> 	Hate, the worm devouring<br> 	All Love's flowers of yesterday,<br> 	  Wait for thee in Guinevere.<br>                    <i> The vision fades.</i> <br> <br>   MERLIN.<br> 	All Love's flowers of yesterday,<br> 	  Wait for thee in Guinevere.<br>   ARTHUR.  Thou wilt not stay! then I will seek for thee,<br> And through the world, if thou art of the world,<br> I'll find thee, crown thee, Guinevere, my Queen!<br> <br> 		ECHOING CHORUS<br> 	All Love's flowers of yesterday,<br> 	  Wait for thee in Guinevere.<br> <br>   ARTHUR.  And yet those mystic voices chaunt of doom!<br> Ah, thou whose vision spans futurity,<br> Hath not thy magic art all power to stay<br> The hand of Fate?<br>   MERLIN.        Our knowledge is not power.<br> Who knows the end of Life hath reached the end,<br> His wisdom is but Death; while ye, who stand<br> Eager to thread the winding maze o' the world,<br> Led on by faith, do more than angels dare.<br> Such destiny is thine: for thy right arm,<br> Out of this mound of earth, shall raise a throne<br> Whose glory echoes through unacted time--<br> Wherefore I charge thee ask no more of Fate.<br> The hand of doom is patient, and the sword<br> That flashes in the glimmering light of dawn,<br> Falls not till night-fall: thou shalt rule thy day.<br>   ARTHUR.  I'll ask no more; I do but crave my sword.<br> <br>    <i> The Spirit of the Lake appears,and at the same time the <br> sword rises again from the Lake</i> .<br> <br>   MERLIN.  Thy prayer is answered, she will give it thee.<br> <br> 	   THE SPIRIT OF THE LAKE<br> 	Arthur, England's chosen lord,<br> 	Fear not Fate but take thy sword;<br> 	Thou the first whose mortal hand<br> 	E'er hath touched that mystic brand.<br> 	Sword and scabbard both are thine,<br> 	Sword and scabbard both divine:<br> 	Guard them well and use them well,<br> 	So that aftertime shall tell<br> 	Of thy kingdom in the sea,<br> 	Blazoned on whose shield shall be,<br> 	"Right and Might and Liberty."<br>    [<i> Arthur makes a movement toward the sword.</i> ]<br> <br> 	Yet beware!  Time's beating wing,<br> 	Restless and untiring,<br> 	Speeds along Time's endless way.<br> 	Bravely thou shalt rule thy day,<br> 	And at last, when Day is done,<br> 	Those three Queens of Avalon,<br> 	Rulers of the night, who keep<br> 	In their charge the keys of sleep,<br> 	Far across this mystic mere<br> 	Silently thy barge shall steer,<br> 	Till thy wearied eyes have won<br> 	Endless sleep in Avalon.<br> <br>   ARTHUR.  He who would rule the day must greet the dawn,<br> There is no hour to lose; give me my sword,<br> For, echoing through the night, I too can hear,<br> The voice of England, like a sobbing child<br> That longs for day; and, gathering in night's sky,<br> I see that throng of England's unborn sons,<br> Whose glory is her glory: prisoned souls<br> With faces pressed against the bars of Time,<br> Waiting their destined hour.  Give me my sword<br> That I may loose Time's bonds and set them free.<br> 	<i> The chorus is heard, and the picture <br> 	is held till the fall of the curtain.</i> <br> <br> 		CHORUS<br> 	Great Pendragon's greater son,<br> 	Arthur, ere thy race be run,<br> 	Thou shalt rule from sea to sea<br> 	England that is yet to be:<br> 	Great Pendragon's son, to thee<br> 	Here we yield Excalibur.<br>  <br>  <center> <h3 align="CENTER" align="center">ACT I</h3>   <b> THE HOLY GRAIL.</b> </center>  <br>  SCENE:--<i> The Great Hall at Camelot.  A wide opening breast high at the back, flanked by marble columns, through which is seen a view of blue hills against a sunset sky.</i>  <br> <i> Sir Kay, Sir Agravaine, and Sir Bedevere, to whom enters <br> Sir Lancelot.</i> <br> <br>   KAY.  Sir Lancelot, this falls well: of late our King<br> Hath ofttimes asked for thee, and thou shalt learn<br> The noise of thy great deeds hath far outstripped<br> Thy good steed's swiftest course: waiting thee here<br> To swell love's welcome home.  What news from Wales?<br>   LANCELOT.  In Wales men speak in whispers; yet 'tis known<br> That Ryons, lately joined in secret league<br> With Mark of Cornwall, doth but wait the hour<br> To strike at Arthur's throne.<br>   AGRAVAINE.                 This news comes pat;<br> Not three days past, deep in the belt of wood<br> That circles round Caerleon's clustering towers,<br> Sir Gawaine's huntsmen chanced upon two spies,<br> Who now lie fast in chains.<br>   KAY.                     And at this hour<br> The King holds council, and shall straight declare<br> If they may live or die.<br>   AGRAVAINE.            Should Gawaine speak<br> And Arthur listen they were dead ere night.<br>   GAWAINE.  That is most sure.<br>   LANCELOT.                   Which way doth Mordred tend?<br>   AGRAVAINE.  Truth, that were hard to tell! his subtle tongue<br> Still weaves a web to catch the thought of others<br> And hide his own.<br>   LANCELOT.      And what then saith the King?<br>   KAY.  He waits upon the word of Guinevere.<br>   GAWAINE.  I dare be sworn this thing hath troubled him.<br>   KAY.  What should he fear though Mark and Ryons, joined<br> With all the hosts of Cornwall and of Wales,<br> Knocked at our gates.<br>   LANCELOT.          Nay, sirs, he knows not fear,<br> Whose warrior heart was bred where spears have grown<br> Thick as the river reeds.  Yet in that heart<br> Dwells a fond nursling hope this news will slay;<br> For since the coming of Queen Guinevere<br> The sword Excalibur hath hung at rest<br> Within its jewelled scabbard, and he dreamed<br> The lust of blood was past.<br>   KAY.                     Would that were all!<br> King Arthur grieves, but 'tis with graver cause.<br>   LANCELOT.  What cause?<br>   KAY.                  What cause!<br>   GAWAINE.                         In truth we do forget.<br> Sir Lancelot knows not that at vesper time<br> A hundred knights of Arthur's fellowship<br> Take a long leave of Camelot and the King.<br>   LANCELOT.  Bound on what quest?<br>   KAY.                           No earthly quest is theirs<br> Who've ta'en a vow to seek the Holy Grail.<br>   LANCELOT.  To seek the Grail! now, sirs, you mock at me!<br> For who, of mortal born, shall hope to find,<br> Searching through all the world, that holy cup<br> Charged with Christ's blood?  That cup no eye hath seen<br> Since long ago to this White Isle 'twas borne<br> By Joseph, who had filled it at the Cross.<br> What Heaven hath hid no man may dare to seek,<br> Save by a sign from Heaven.<br>   KAY.                     Heaven's sign hath come<br> In miracle and wonder: three nights past--<br> When all our company were sat at meat--<br> Above the murmur of the feast there leapt<br> The crack and cry of thunder, and the roof<br> Was cloven as with a sword: then down the hall,<br> Aslant upon a bar of light that gleamed<br> As though the sun were turned to molten gold,<br> Passed a white angel, bearing in her hands<br> The sacred vision of the cup of Christ.<br>   LANCELOT.  What like was it to see?<br> 	<i> During the following speech the hall darkens.</i> <br>   KAY.                               That none may tell,<br> For, dimly veil&egrave;d in a cloth of white,<br> It went as it had come, unseen of all.<br> Yet while it passed it left, though none knew how,<br> The witness of its presence in men's eyes:<br> And, dumbly gazing, each in other found<br> The stamp of some new glory; then uprose<br> Our youngest knight, Sir Percival, and cried:<br> "Now thanks for what hath been and what shall be!<br> For here I vow to rest not till these eyes<br> Have openly beheld the cup itself!"<br> And, as one note at dawn will wake the woods,<br> Voice after voice re-echoed Percival's,<br> Till, one by one, a hundred of our knights<br> Had joined themselves unto this holy quest.<br>   LANCELOT.  If this be so--<br>   GAWAINE.                  Why, sir, 'twas in this hall!<br>   KAY.  And close upon this hour.<br> 	<i> A peal of thunder is heard, followed by a lightning flash.</i> <br>   LANCELOT.                      What cry was that?<br>   KAY.  Nay, see, 'tis here again.<br> 	<i> As he speaks, a slanting ray of light falls through the hall, <br> 	enfolding the form of a maiden bearing the cup, from the centre <br> 	of which a red light strikes like a star through the transparent <br> 	veil that covers it.  Sir Lancelot kneels as the vision passes and <br> 	disappears.</i> <br>   LANCELOT.                      Ah, go not yet!<br> 'Tis gone! and did mine eyes not vouch 'twas here,<br> I'd say it was a dream; for never yet<br> Hath mortal vision gazed on aught so fair!<br> Didst thou not note how all the air was filled<br> With sweetest odours?<br>   GAWAINE.           So it was before.<br>   KAY.  Said we not truth?<br>   LANCELOT [<i> rising</i> ]<i> .</i>     Ay, and by this I know<br> That age of marvels, long ago foretold<br> By Merlin, when he built our Table Round,<br> Hath come at last; and we who live to-day<br> Shall witness wonders great and terrible<br> Shaking the earth, until that happier hour<br> When he whom God hath chosen of us all<br> With mortal eyes shall pierce Heaven's mystery,<br> And see the Grail itself.<br>   GAWAINE.               'Twas said last night,<br> That he alone shall win this saving grace,<br> Whose heart stands clean of sin.<br>   LANCELOT.                     Ay, sir, 'tis so.<br> And he alone who wills it so can pierce<br> The secrets of our hearts!  Not all may win,<br> Yet straining at the goal there's none can lose<br> The grace that comes of strife.<br> <br> 	<i> Mordred has entered unseen during the last speech, carrying <br> 	a scroll in his hand.</i> <br> <br>   MORDRED.                     How now, Sir Knights,<br> Ye do forget the hour!  Have ye not heard<br> That they whose names are duly here enrolled,<br> Bound by their vows to seek the Holy Grail,<br> Within a breathing space shall take their leave<br> Of Arthur and his Court?<br>   LANCELOT.             I pray you, sir,<br> Of your good grace add my name to the roll.<br>   MORDRED.  Hast thou considered well?<br>   LANCELOT.                           My lord, I have,<br> And shall be ready when the list is called.<br> <i> Exit Lancelot.<br> </i>   MORDRED [<i> half to himself</i> ]<i> .</i>   So Lancelot goes!<br>   KAY.                                         I dare be sworn he will not,<br> Nay, though his oath were loudest of them all,<br> Yet Arthur's love will hold.<br>   MORDRED [<i> turning fiercely upon Kay</i> ]<i> .</i>   Who dares speak<br> So gross a treason 'gainst our lord the King?<br> In truth, Sir Kay, I thought thee worthier<br> Of Arthur's love.<br>   KAY.           Nay, sir, I did but think<br> That Lancelot, who is worthier than us all,<br> Would go or stay as that same love commands.<br>   MORDRED.  And thou! and thou! yet think ye that the King<br> Who loves him best and knows him worthiest,<br> Would bid him break his vow?  Now, hark'e, sirs:<br> Ye know not him ye worship, and your praise<br> Is but a vapour that doth hide the sun,<br> But ye shall know him!  Nay, sirs, tarry not,<br> But see that all is ready for the King.<br>   KAY.  Be sure, my lord, we shall not fail the King.<br> 	<i> Exeunt Kay and other Knights</i> .<br>   MORDRED [<i> alone</i> ]<i> .</i>   Yea, Arthur's love would hold him, but it shall not.<br> Lancelot shall go, and, in that vacant seat<br> Where now his heart sits guardian to the King,<br> Envenomed hate shall keep a closer watch.<br> Lancelot shall go.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Morgan.</i> <br> <br>                   Ah! mother, thou art here.<br> What saith the Queen?<br>   MORGAN.            She doth attend the council.<br>   MORDRED.  And her voice?<br>   MORGAN.                 Is tuned to plead for mercy.<br>   MORDRED.  'Tis well, for Arthur heeds no voice save hers.<br> These dogs whose tongues I feared will now go free.<br>   MORGAN.  Then tell me, boy, what tidings did they bear?<br>   MORDRED.  The gathered hosts of Cornwall and of Wales<br> Wait but my sign.<br>   MORGAN.        They shall not wait for long.<br> The year grows green, and May-day comes again--<br> Day of thy birth, and day of Arthur's doom.<br>   MORDRED.  Of Arthur's doom?<br>   MORGAN.                    Ay, for 'twas so foretold,<br> Ere yet thine eyes had opened on the world,<br> That he whose hand should strike at Arthur's heart<br> On May-day must be born.  And thou art he,<br> For in thy veins an avenging poison flows,<br> Distilled in that dark hour when Merlin's lips<br> Hailed Arthur as Pendragon's rightful heir,<br> And left me bastard.<br>   MORDRED.          Ay, yet one thing lacks:<br> Think you, will Lancelot join this holy quest?<br>   MORGAN.  What should you fear, though Lancelot go or stay?<br>   MORDRED.  I fear, yet know not what--his loyal love<br> Twines around Arthur like a coil of steel<br> That turns the keenest edge.  Yea, well I know<br> That while Sir Lancelot stays, the King is safe.<br>   MORGAN.  Thou fool! the King were safer if he went.<br>   MORDRED.  What dost thou say?<br>   MORGAN.                      I say what thou shouldst know:<br> The King doth love Sir Lancelot?<br>   MORDRED.                      Ay, too well!<br>   MORGAN.  Too well, in truth, for next the King stands one<br> Who loves him more than well.<br>   MORDRED.                   Not Guinevere?<br>   MORGAN.  Ay, she!<br>   MORDRED.        This is thy malice.<br>   MORGAN.                            Think'st thou so?<br> Trust me, 'tis true--a woman hath no wiles<br> To hide her secret from a woman's gaze,<br> Whose eyes are never blindfold.  Dost forget<br> When the news came of Lancelot's heavy wound<br> How she did weep and wail?<br>   MORDRED.                So did the King.<br>   MORGAN.  Ay, truth, so did the King, yet that's not all,<br> For later, when the happier tidings came<br> That, tended by Elaine, his wound was whole,<br> Hadst thou but seen her then!  The King made glad,<br> But Guinevere's white lips could shape no smile.<br> Her jealous heart was torn.<br>   MORDRED.                 If this be so,<br> And Lancelot loves her too, then all are trapped!<br>   MORGAN.  Nay, take it not from me, look for thyself.<br> 	<i> Herald's trumpet heard without.</i> <br> But see she comes, take heed and guard thy tongue.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Guinevere.</i> <br> <br>   MORDRED.  Madam, what saith the King?<br>   GUINEVERE.                           Hast thou not heard?<br> Thy mother's prayer for mercy hath prevailed.<br> The spies are pardoned.<br>   MORDRED.            Madam, 'tis to thee<br> They owe their right to live.<br>   GUINEVERE.                 Nay, to the King!<br> Who knowing naught of fear, fears naught to spare<br> Where weaker hearts would slay.  To-day at eve<br> Our knights ride forth upon a Holy Quest,<br> At such a season then it was not fit<br> That on their spotless banners there should rest<br> The smirch of hireling blood.<br>   MORGAN.                    Madam, the King!<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Arthur, with Knights attending.</i> <br> <br>   ARTHUR.  Our faithful knights do know th' appointed hour.<br>   MORDRED.  My lord, they wait your call.<br>   ARTHUR.                                Give me the roll.<br> 	<i> Mordred hands scroll to the King.</i> <br> Is all complete?<br>   MORDRED.      Nay, truth, I had forgot,<br> One name is lacking there.<br>   ARTHUR.                 Whose name is that?<br> Stand there not here enough of goodly knights<br> That I must lose from our great fellowship,<br> But ye would cry for more?<br>   MORDRED.                Your pardon, Sire,<br> I did but learn it now, within the hour:<br> Sir Lancelot hath returned.<br>   ARTHUR.                  Well, sir, what then?<br>   GUINEVERE [<i> starting</i> ]<i> .</i>   Sir Lancelot home!<br>   MORGAN [<i> approaching her</i> ]<i> .</i>                 Ay, Madam, he is here.<br>   ARTHUR.  Lancelot is welcome home.<br>   MORDRED.                          Yet 'tis to fear<br> He comes but to depart.<br>   ARTHUR.              What mean you, sir?<br>   MORDRED.  He, too, my lord, would join this Holy Quest.<br>   ARTHUR.  Sir Lancelot?  Nay, you jest! this shall not be.<br> Go straight and send him here.<br>   MORDRED.                    My lord, I will.  [<i> Exit Mordred.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.  Morgan, thou hast our leave.<br> 	<i> Exeunt Morgan, Ladies of the Court, and Knights.</i> <br>                                           Nay, good my lord,<br> This troubles thee.<br>   ARTHUR.          It would an it were true;<br> For, as each added name summed up the list,<br> Methought though all should go yet one remains,<br> Flower of all knighthood, Lancelot, thou at least<br> Shalt stand beside thy King!<br>   GUINEVERE.                Yet should he go<br> Thou still hast that which serves thee more than all,<br> Thy sword Excalibur, whose mystic blade<br> Hath carved this Island Empire from the sea,--<br> Thou hast thy goodly sword.<br>   ARTHUR.                  Ay, and my Queen,<br> Whose dear commands are set as Heaven's high voice,<br> Lifting me nearer Heaven.<br>   GUINEVERE.             Nay, trust thy sword,<br> 'Twill serve thee better far.<br>   ARTHUR.                    Long time gone by,<br> When this same sword by magic hands was given,<br> Old Merlin said, take heed and guard it well,<br> Yet guard the scabbard too, for that is more<br> E'en than the blade it sheathes.  I knew not then<br> If he spoke false or true: I know it now.<br> For at thy coming, Guinevere, my Queen,<br> The havoc turned to harvest at thy feet;<br> From out the bellowing throat of war there came<br> A sweeter, softer music, and the earth,<br> New christened by thy smile, broke forth in flower.<br> Thou art our scabbard, and in thy pure soul,<br> Where only peace may dwell, our sword lies sheathed!<br> Yet that rich dower thy father gave with thee,<br> That image of the world, our Table Round,<br> A kingdom's heart set in a rim of steel<br> Forged of the spears of all the goodliest knights<br> Of all the earth; that too must count for much,<br> And if he now should fail that out of all<br> Hast shown himself the mightiest, then I think<br> Our day draws to its end.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Lancelot.</i> <br> <br>                          Most welcome home!<br> It was but now I learned from Mordred's lips<br> Thou too wouldst join this quest.<br>   LANCELOT.                      'Tis so, my lord.<br>   ARTHUR.  If that same word by other lips were spoken<br> I'd say 'twas false.  Dost thou so lightly count<br> Our long-tried love, that, without word or sign,<br> Thou'dst quit our side?  Nay, but I wrong thee there,<br> For we are one, and haply thou hast told<br> Thy purpose to the Queen.<br>   GUINEVERE.             Not so, indeed.<br> I heard it not till now.<br>   LANCELOT.             Nay, hear me, Arthur.<br> I have no life, no soul that is not thine,<br> No heart but waits some fitting hour to bleed<br> In thy great cause; yet, couldst thou see that heart<br> And know its present sickness, thou wouldst say:<br> Lancelot, ride forth, thou hast our willing leave.<br>   ARTHUR.  Thinkest thou so?  We'll speak of this again.<br>   LANCELOT.  Thy voice alone shall bid me go or stay.<br> 	<i> Exit Lancelot.</i> <br>   ARTHUR.  And thou shalt stay, for now I do divine<br> This sickness at thy heart.  [<i> Turning to Guinevere.</i> ]  <br> Canst thou not guess?<br>   GUINEVERE.  Indeed I cannot.<br>   ARTHUR.                     'Tis some cause of love<br> That bids him go.<br>   GUINEVERE [<i> starting</i> ]<i> .</i>   Of love?<br>   ARTHUR.                          Ay, dear, of love!<br> Didst think that our two hearts had drained love's springs?<br> Thou hast not heard, but, ere thy coming hither,<br> 'Twas known that Lancelot wooed the fair Elaine.<br>   GUINEVERE.  'Twas she that nursed him when his wound was sore?<br>   ARTHUR.  Ay, true, 'twas she; but even then their loves<br> Had drifted wide asunder, and of late<br> He has not breathed her name.<br>   GUINEVERE.                 Why then 'tis sure<br> He loves her not.<br>   ARTHUR.        In love there's naught that's sure.<br> Yet is he framed in such a constant mould<br> That truly I believe he loves her still.<br> Some little knot hath ravelled up the skein<br> That links their hearts.  There needs a woman's wit<br> To set the tangle straight.<br>   GUINEVERE.               A woman's wit?<br>   ARTHUR.  Ay, dear, and thine.<br>   GUINEVERE.                   Indeed, I think not so.<br>   ARTHUR.  Indeed 'tis so, bid Lancelot come to thee.<br> Thy tongue will find a charm that may unlock<br> The guarded secret of his chafing heart.<br> 	<i> Guinevere does not move.</i> <br> Nay, thou wilt do't? if our all happy love<br> Hath known no jar, then must we search the more<br> To find the missing note for those whose souls<br> Are not so finely tuned.<br>   GUINEVERE.            Then thou art sure<br> Thou art all happy?<br>   ARTHUR.          Nay, how canst thou ask?<br>   GUINEVERE.  A little field-flower, lighted by a star,<br> Stands but a tiny speck beneath that lamp<br> Which shines o'er half the world: yet once it dreamed<br> That this great beacon light was all its own.<br> 'Tis long since thou hast spoken of thy love,<br> Dost know how long?<br>   ARTHUR.          That is the fate of kings,<br> Whose lives are as a picture for the world,<br> Not for their own content.  When we were wed,<br> I dreamed of many an hour when we would sit,<br> Thy hand in mine, recalling that sweet day<br> When, like a flash of sunlight through the trees,<br> I saw thy face at Cameliard; but now<br> The busy hours slip by, each new day brings<br> Its burden of new duty, and our loves<br> Are too long silent.  Yet full well thou know'st--<br> 	<i> Approaching her.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE [<i> interrupting him and making away</i> ]<i> .</i>   Yes, yes, I know,<br> heed not my idle words.<br> It was a foolish thought that slipped my tongue.<br> I'll do thy bidding straight.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Morgan.</i> <br> <br>   MORGAN.  Your pardon, Madam, but the fair Elaine<br> Is newly come from Astolat, and craves<br> An audience with the Queen.<br>   ARTHUR.                  Now this falls well.<br> So you shall plead for both.<br>   GUINEVERE [<i> to Morgan</i> ]<i> .</i>   I'll see her here.<br> Go tell Sir Lancelot I would speak with him.<br> 	<i> Exit Morgan.</i> <br>   ARTHUR.  And later, when Sir Lancelot's name is called,<br> 'Tis thou shalt bid him stay.  Till then, farewell!<br> 	<i> Exit Arthur.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.  Farewell!    [<i> Guinevere is left alone.</i> <br> Am I so weak that every random word<br> Can shake my heart?  When Arthur said but now<br> "It is some cause of love bids Lancelot go,"<br> I trembled like a thief that's trapped at night.<br> For, in his god-like gaze, I thought I saw<br> The searching eyes of God; piercing my soul<br> Where lurks the shameful secret of my love<br> That none must know.  Ah me, if Lancelot knew!<br> How he would spurn me!  But he shall not know,<br> Wherefore 'twere better he should go away;<br> For while he was away, within my heart<br> His image dwelt securely, like a star<br> Hung high above me in a stainless sky--<br> A lamp illumined with a fireless flame<br> That wrought no ill,--but now, when he is by,<br> The light grows blinding, and its fiercer rays<br> Consume my very soul.<br> <br> 	<i> She stands wrapt in thought as enter Elaine.</i> <br> <br>   ELAINE.  Thy pardon, madam.  Morgan bade me come.<br> 	<i> She kneels as Guinevere turns to her.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE [<i> aside</i> ]<i> .</i>   Indeed, but she is fair!  <br> [<i> Aloud.</i> ]  Nay, do not kneel.     <br> 	[<i> Elaine rises.</i> <br> What wouldst thou with me?<br>   ELAINE.                 'Twas but yester eve,<br> Within thy garden by the castle wall,<br> For the first time I saw thee with thy maids,<br> Where, 'midst them all, thy prouder beauty seemed<br> To wear the gentlest smile: 'twas then I thought:<br> "Could I but see the Queen, I'd tell my heart<br> And win her favour."  Now methinks I erred.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Has, then, my face so changed?<br>   ELAINE.                                   Sweet lady, no.<br> Yet in thy presence my poor lips are dumb.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Then I must speak for thee: sit near me here.<br> <i> Elaine sits at her feet.</i> <br> So, thou art she our great Sir Lancelot loves?<br> I do not wonder.<br>   ELAINE.       I did think so once.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Be sure he loves thee still.<br>   ELAINE.                                 Ah, would 'twere so!<br>   GUINEVERE.  Was then his love so sweet? tell me how sweet.<br>   ELAINE.  I scarce knew then: for all the uncounted joys<br> Of that brief time seemed but an earnest paid<br> From Love's unbounded store.  Now, when all's lost,<br> Remembrance feeds my grief and, drowned in tears,<br> Brings back each little token of his love<br> That passed unheeded then.<br>   GUINEVERE.              There's joy in that--<br> He loved thee once; methinks I know some hearts<br> Would take thy sorrow's burden but to win<br> What thou dost still possess: but tell me more.<br> Such love, if love it were, could not so end<br> Without a cause--perchance the fault was thine.<br>   ELAINE.  I think so too, and yet I know not how.<br> The end came all so swiftly: on that day<br> When he rode forth I do remember well<br> I scarce was sad, our parting was so sweet.<br> But, when he came again, it was as though<br> The night had fallen at noontide; all was changed.<br>   GUINEVERE.  What time was that?<br>   ELAINE.                        Ah, madam, thou canst date<br> My sorrow with thy joy.<br>   GUINEVERE [<i> rising suddenly</i> ]<i> .</i>   What dost thou say?<br>   ELAINE.  Nay, be not angered: so it chanced to fall,<br> In that same hour when thou, new crowned a Queen,<br> Didst come from Cameliard as Arthur's bride--<br> My love was lost.  'Twas Lancelot brought thee here.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Ay, was it so?  In truth I had forgot.<br> Yes, sure, 'twas he.  And now thou think'st that I<br> Can win thy love again!  How shall that be?<br>   ELAINE.  Hold Lancelot to thy side, I ask but that!<br> Let him not go to-day upon this quest,<br> Whence none, perchance, shall live to win his way<br> Back to King Arthur's court.  Ah, bind him here,<br> That so my love, by some sweet chance, may find<br> The path it missed before, and creep again<br> Back to that heart that once did seem its home!<br> Thou dost not answer?<br>   GUINEVERE.         Hush, what sound is that?<br> <br> 	   CHAUNT OF THE KNIGHTS<i>  </i> [<i> without</i> ]<br> 	Look not to thy sword,<br> 	  Fame is but a breath,<br> 	That, for all reward,<br> 	  Brings thee only death.<br> Rise, and go forth with us who seek the Grail,<br> 	Winning for reward<br> 	Fame that shall not fail.<br> <br>   ELAINE [<i> who has gone to the back</i> ].  It is the chaunt of those who <br> seek the Grail.  See, they make ready.  Lancelot is not there!<br>   GUINEVERE.  Go, leave me now, for I must speak with him,<br> And think what I may do to serve thee best.<br>   ELAINE [<i> kissing her hand</i> ]<i> .</i>   Ah, would I owned thy crown that <br> may command, Or thou my love, that so he needs must yield.<br> 	<i> Exit Elaine.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.  And would I ne'er had seen thee, for thy words<br> Have set my heart on fire!  Can it be so?<br> That then when first we met his love did change?<br> It is not so, and his own lips shall speak<br> And say 'tis false, or else I shall go mad.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Lancelot.</i> <br> <br> Ah, thou art here.  Why is thy mind so bent<br> To leave the court?  The King would know the cause.<br> Think'st thou, because thy favour stands so high<br> In fame of earthly deeds, that thou shalt win<br> This heavenly crown?<br>   LANCELOT.         Indeed, I think not so.<br> His eyes alone shall see that holy cup,<br> Whose soul stands clear of sin.<br>   GUINEVERE.                   What boots it then<br> To adventure all upon a hopeless quest?<br>   LANCELOT.  Ay, hopeless, for I may not touch the goal.<br> Yet once, when I lay stricken nigh to death,<br> By this same vessel of the Sangrael<br> My hurt was cured; now, when my heart is pierced,<br> Though by no mortal stroke of sword or spear,<br> Perchance again that same sweet miracle<br> May heal my deeper wound.<br>   GUINEVERE.             I know thy wound.<br>   LANCELOT.  If that were so I should be shamed indeed!<br>   GUINEVERE.  Indeed, 'tis so.  Elaine was here but now.<br> I did not dream that all the world could show<br> So fair a maid.  No marvel that thy heart<br> Is sick with love.<br>   LANCELOT.       Madam, I love her not!<br>   GUINEVERE.  Nay, that is false: think it no shame to own<br> What, in some angry fit, thy tongue denied.<br>   LANCELOT.  My shame lies deeper, seeing I once vowed<br> A love that now lies dead.<br>   GUINEVERE.              Elaine's soft eyes<br> Will find Love's tomb, and charm it back to life.<br> Go to her now, and plead thy suit again;<br> I'll warrant you will find her not too hard,<br> Your wooing is half done.<br>   LANCELOT.              Urge me no more,<br> For here, by Heaven, I swear I love her not.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Then wherefore wouldst thou enter on this quest?<br>   LANCELOT.  Nay, madam, in thy pity, spare me that!<br>   GUINEVERE.  I will be answered.  Am I not thy Queen?<br>   LANCELOT.  Thou art indeed, and therefore hast thy will!<br> I had thought to pass away and leave behind<br> The dear remembrance of thy loyal love<br> I once deserved.  But now that too has gone,<br> For thou wouldst wring the secret from my lips,<br> That brands me traitor.<br>   GUINEVERE.           Traitor!<br>   LANCELOT.                    Aye!  'Tis true,<br> And thou hast known it, else thy gracious heart<br> Were not so pitiless: 'twas for this I've seen<br> Those veiled eyes cloak the hate they scorned to tell,<br> When, by some evil chance, their gaze met mine;<br> For this thy gentle smile took sudden flight<br> When I passed by.<br>   GUINEVERE.     No! no! no more, no more!<br>   LANCELOT.  Nay, madam, drink thy vengeance to the fill.<br> I leave the court because I love its Queen!<br> <i> Flings himself at her feet.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.  I did not hear thee; speak that word again.<br>   LANCELOT.  Ay, once again, I love thee; all my shame<br> Lies naked at thy feet; I do but crave<br> That here my life may end.<br>   GUINEVERE.              Nay, do not rise.<br> There's something I would say, yet know not how;<br> For if thy life must end, then so must mine.<br> You cannot guess my shame.<br>   LANCELOT.               Thou hast no shame,<br> Save that which my base love hath laid on thee!<br>   GUINEVERE.  Indeed I have: oft when we kneel and pray,<br> Before God's image bleeding on the Cross,<br> We cheat our souls, for our vain hearts still seek<br> The manhood not the God: 'twas so with me.<br> That hour when Arthur came, it seemed as though<br> Christ's hand had beckoned, and I knelt to him,<br> And, in the mist of worship, thought I saw,<br> The wing&egrave;d heart of love.  But when you came,<br> His great ambassador from Camelot,<br> I saw Love's heart indeed, and knew I loved--<br> But not the King.<br>   LANCELOT.      What sayest thou?  Not the King?<br> Wouldst make me mad?<br>   GUINEVERE.        Ah me, that home-coming<br> When we two rode in silence side by side,<br> And all my heart was hungry for a word!<br> The blossoms of the springtime turned to flame--<br> And yet you spoke not; now it is too late.<br> 	<i> She moves away.</i> <br>   LANCELOT [<i> rising</i> ]<i> .</i>   No, not too late, unless those <br> lips are false.  Ah, hear me now--thou wouldst have heard me then--<br> My lonely love I could have borne alone,<br> Counting this mortal life too short a term<br> Of exile for my sin: but now that's past,<br> And, through the darkness, like a sudden star,<br> Thy heart stands clear, lighting our sweeter way.<br> Nay, do not turn thy face, thou knowest 'tis so.<br> Love speaks at last--and Love will be obeyed.<br> 	<i> He moves towards her, and she turns as if to yield to his <br> 	embrace when the chaunt of the Knights breaks forth again, <br> 	and the movement is arrested.</i> <br> <br> 	Look not to thy love,<br> 	  Love that lives an hour;<br> 	Heaven's voice above<br> 	  Calls thee from her bower.<br> Rise, and go forth, with us who seek the Grail,<br> 	Winning from above<br> 	Love that shall not fail.<br> <br>   GUINEVERE.  Yea, truth, 'tis love that speaks!  But not our love,<br> The love of Heaven, of honour, and of--him.<br> <br> Rise, and go forth, with us who seek the Grail,<br> 	Winning from above<br> 	Love that shall not fail.<br> <br> It is their voice that calls, and thou wilt go.<br> I thought to hold thee here--I may not now.<br>   LANCELOT.  My shame is dumb; yet, in thy purer heart,<br> I may find grace to save what still remains<br> Of my wrecked soul: my trust stands all in thee.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Nay, trust thyself.<br>   LANCELOT.                      Thy words must be my law.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Wait not for that, a woman is too weak<br> To guard what's best in what she loves the best.<br> We shall not speak again.     [<i> Exit Guinevere.</i> <br>   LANCELOT.              Ay, once again,<br> When from thy lips shall come the dread command<br> That sends me hence; and like a flaming sword<br> Love bars the gate of this new paradise<br> Which love hath won; yet through the desert night<br> Of life's long pilgrimage, one star shall stay,<br> And when death comes at last, to end our quest,<br> My fainting heart shall quicken at the thought,<br> 'Twas thou didst bid me go.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter a Squire.</i> <br> <br>                            Ah, thou art here.<br> Put on my sword.<br> <br> 	<i> The trumpet sounds as Arthur enters, preceded by <br> 	a procession of Priests and Choristers chaunting the song <br> 	of the Grail, while the hall fills with a throng of Knights.  <br> 	Arthur and Guinevere take their places on the throne, on <br> 	the steps of which stands Elaine next the Queen.</i> <br> <br> 	THE CHAUNT OF THE GRAIL<br> 	Look not to thy sword,<br> 	  Fame is but a breath,<br> 	That, for all reward,<br> 	  Brings thee only death.<br> Rise, and go forth with us who seek the Grail,<br> 	Winning for reward<br> 	Fame that shall not fail.<br> <br> 	<i> At the close of the chaunt Percival comes forward from <br> 	the group of the Knights of the Grail and kneels before Arthur.</i> <br>   PERCIVAL.

My lord, I too<br> Would take those vows that bind me to this quest.<br>   ARTHUR [<i> to Guinevere</i> ]<i> .</i>   Didst thou not speak with him?<br>   GUINEVERE.                                              I did, my lord.<br>   ARTHUR.  Then had thy voice no power?<br>   GUINEVERE.                           In truth, I think<br> Some mightier voice than mine doth bid him go.<br>   ARTHUR.  Then I must speak: this quest is not for thee.<br> For thy rich manhood hath a holier task--<br> Here, by thy King, to fight for this poor world<br> Till that last call which sheathes our swords in sleep.<br>   LANCELOT.  My lord, thou knowest me not.  I am not fit<br> To stand by thee.<br>   ARTHUR.        Nay, Lancelot, it is thou<br> That dost not know thyself for what thou art!<br> This crippled realm, how shall it find the goal,<br> If thou, the strongest, who hast been our staff,<br> If thou, the mightiest, who hast been our shield,<br> And thou, the gentlest, that art now our guide,<br> Seek thine own way towards Heaven; and so dost steal<br> The sun's bright rays wherewith to seek the sun,<br> Leaving this lonely world to grope its way<br> In darkness to the end?  Thou shalt not go!<br>   LANCELOT.  My lord, did I but know myself as strong<br> As is the weakest of these knights whose vows<br> Were sworn but now, it would not need thy voice<br> To bid me stay.<br>   ARTHUR.      Still thy resolve stands firm?<br> Then thou shalt hear a sager voice than ours.<br> Old Merlin, by whose mystic craft we read<br> The unturned page of Time, stand forth and speak!<br> 	<i> Merlin steps forward.</i> <br>   MERLIN.<br> 	All shall seek the Holy Grail,<br> 	All and all save one shall fail.<br>   ARTHUR.

Say on.  What is this love that bids him go?<br>   MERLIN.  I can but read the words that Fate hath writ.<br>   ARTHUR.  Then we have done with Fate.  Go, get thee hence,<br> And never more shall that dark face of thine<br> Pass, like a withered shadow, through these halls!<br>   MERLIN.<br> 	I go hence, yet Fate shall stay,<br> 	Till the dawn of that dread day;<br> 	He Pendragon's son shall slay<br> 	That is born with the May!<br> 	<i> As Merlin goes out the hall grows darker, and the sunset <br> 	at the back gleams more brightly.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.  My lord, I pray you call him back again!<br>   ARTHUR.  Nay, heed him not, my Queen--nor, Lancelot, thou!<br> For if indeed Love speaks with double voice,<br> One base, one noble, then be sure my lips<br> Do bear the nobler message; for the world<br> Tells of no higher, purer love than that<br> Of brother unto brother.

My lord,<br> A woman is too weak to rule men's hearts.<br>   ARTHUR.  Not so, my Queen.  Hath not thy purer heart,<br> Sole ruler over him who rules this realm,<br> Won, from rude wars, that sweeter crown of peace<br> That smiles upon our land from sea to sea?<br> And wouldst thou fail me now? when on thy word<br> The welfare of a kingdom waits in doubt--<br> Wouldst thou be dumb?<br>   GUINEVERE.         Indeed, indeed I would.<br>   ARTHUR.  Nay, I command thee--speak as I would speak!<br>   ELAINE.  Ay, madam, speak!  My life lies in thy word.<br>   GUINEVERE [<i> after a pause, and without looking at Lancelot</i> ].  <br> My lord, I do thy bidding--Lancelot, stay!<br> <br> 	<i> The Knights of the Grail file past, singing as they go.</i> <br> <br> 	Ere those lips be dumb<br> 	  That would bid thee stay;<br> 	Ere the night be come,<br> 	  Rise, and come away!<br> We, who go forth to seek the Holy Grail,<br> 	Win, ere night be come,<br> 	Light that shall not fail.<br> <br> <br> <br>  <center><h3 align="CENTER" align="center">ACT II</h3>   <b> THE QUEEN'S MAYING.</b>  </center> <br>  SCENE:--<i> The slope of a hill in spring-time studded with bushes of whitethorn.  A company of Maidens, garlanded with white may, descend the slope.  They are followed by Guinevere and her Ladies.</i> <br>  <br> 		THE MAY SONG<br> 	Ere upon its snowy bed<br> 	  Lies the firstborn of the spring,<br> 	Ere the crocus lifts its head,<br> 	  Or the swallow finds its wing,<br> 	Love is here:<br> 	Say ye then Earth's flowers shall fade?<br> 	  We shall tell ye nay:<br> 	Love, the first of all flowers made,<br> 	  Lives from May to May.<br> <br> 	He beneath whose sun-kissed feet<br> 	  Daisies rise to kiss the sun,<br> 	Lily, rose, and meadow-sweet,--<br> 	  Love, that is all flowers in one,<br> 	Love is here.<br> 	Heed not then the blooms that fall,<br> 	  Dying with the day,<br> 	Love, the sweetest flower of all,<br> 	  Lives from May to May.<br> <br>   GUINEVERE.  Here, on the verge of this untravelled wood,<br> Beneath Love's flowering banner, we have set<br> Our camp of war.  For, know ye, ladies all,<br> That dread adventure whereunto ye are called<br> Is no poor mockery of a tournament<br> Such as our lords love, jousting for a prize!<br> Our cause is mortal; and those unseen swords<br> We women wield, are forged to pierce men's hearts.<br> Whereat, if any cheek grow white with fear,<br> Let its poor owner straightway quit the field.<br> Nay, all are brave? 'tis well.  Ere day had dawned<br> Our scouts and spies, which are the wing&egrave;d birds,<br> Reported that a band of swaggering knights<br> Did challenge our approach; 'gainst them we war.<br> Yet hear me--not like timorous men who find<br> Their courage grow from fellowship in fear,<br> Wherefore in serried ranks they face their foe.<br> <i> Our</i>  greater strength hath ever best been proved<br> In single combat: so we fight to-day;<br> Nor need these fairer faces be encased<br> In casques of steel; that never was our plan--<br> For so indeed we should but hide from view<br> All Love's bright armoury that lodges there.<br> But, truth, I waste my breath where all are skilled<br> In these same arts of war.  Therefore set forth,<br> Each on her chosen way, for in this wood<br> Lurks many a pleasant bower o'er-roofed with green,<br> Where moss and harebells weave a patterned floor<br> With shifting tracery of added gold,<br> Shot from the sun's eyes, peeping through the boughs<br> Of flowering thorn.  There should each lady lead<br> Her conquered knight, that so, by gentler arts,<br> Her love may cure the wounds that Love hath made.<br> So, fare we all till sunset.  Haste, away!<br> 	<i> As they move towards the wood, Dagonet rushes in <br> 	and falls on his knees before the Queen.  He bears a <br> 	large rough garland of flowers hanging about his neck <br> 	like a horse-collar.</i> <br>   DAGONET [<i> who is trembling with mock fear</i> ]<i> .</i>   Sweet ladies, <br> save me though ye love me not!  I am sore pressed.<br>   GUINEVERE.      What, hath some beast pursued thee?<br>   DAGONET.  Ay, truth, a most sweet beast, yet fearsome, too.<br>   CLARISSANT.  I pray you, madam, let us call these knights.<br> We are in danger else.<br>   GUINEVERE.     Is this your valour,<br> That so you quake at shadows?  Shame on ye!<br>   DAGONET.  Ay, shame, for here is a beast that will harm no <br> lady, though at this budding season 'tis very fatal to man.<br>   GUINEVERE.  I would hear more of this beast.  What form hath it?<br>   DAGONET.  Well, to be plain yet modest withal, and not too <br> curious, it is in all things shaped like a woman.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Truly, a very monstrous woman that would so pursue <br> a fool.<br>   DAGONET.  Faith, there be many such, though 'tis only your sage <br> fool that fears them.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Rise, Dagonet, and tell us how it chanced.<br>   DAGONET.  Then stiffen your sinews, for 'tis a heart-shaking <br> legend.  Hither came I through the wood, thinking of naught, and <br> so counting myself wise beyond my years, when of a sudden I espied <br> a maid who tended a herd of swine; whereat, I do confess it, I <br> fell a-weeping bitterly, for surely never was mortal woman so fitly <br> employed.<br>   CLARISSANT.  You hear him, madam.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Nay, let him run on.<br>   DAGONET.  Ay, 'tis the finish that will cause ye to quake.  For <br> this same maid, not content with her most righteous calling, and <br> haply moved by my tears, most artfully flung this halter about my <br> neck, and swore a most villainous oath that she loved me well.  <br> Whereat I, being, as 'tis known, only half a fool, slipped from her <br> embrace, and fled incontinently.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Now thou art half a man, and therefore a most complete <br> fool, that could so dread to be loved.<br>   DAGONET.  Wherein thou art wrong, for I have a leaning that way, <br> being very tenderly fashioned, and with a taste for red lips.  But <br> alack, I am troubled with a most constant heart that goes not with love!<br>   GUINEVERE.  How say you?  Is it so wise to rail against constancy?<br>   DAGONET.  Nay, I would question thee.  Canst tell me now what is <br> most like to a river that drains to the sea?<br>   GUINEVERE.  Faith, I cannot.<br>   DAGONET.  Why, a maiden who weeps in the rain.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Where hast thou seen that?<br>   DAGONET.  Last night, where I sheltered from the storm, there passed <br> a lady sobbing as she rode, and with her tears the rain kept even tune; <br> 'twas a sweet contest, yet I'll warrant her eyes outstayed the drippings <br> of the sky.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Knew you her face?<br>   DAGONET.  'Twas laid so low upon her palfrey's neck I saw it not.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Go, fool, on your way.<br>   DAGONET.  Ay, madam, by your leave, for I must seek the King, who <br> comes from hunting.  In May-time your King and your fool were ever very <br> prettily assorted.<br> 	<i> He goes up the hill singing.</i> <br> <br> 	The cuckoo's note doth haunt the May,<br> 	   And some are glad,<br> 	   And some grow mad,<br> 	But the fool goes singing on his way.<br> <br> 	<i> Exit Dagonet.  As he goes the Queen stands wrapt in thought.</i> <br> <br>   CLARISSANT.  Nay, madam, see, 'tis noon, we waste our day.<br>   GUINEVERE [<i> rousing herself</i> ].  Truly; lift up your voices, let us on.<br> <br> 		    MAY SONG<br> <br> 	Dreaming 'neath a whitened thorn,<br> 	  Like a rose-leaf on the snow,<br> 	Lovers! ere the day be worn,<br> 	  Ye shall find him and shall know,<br> 	   Love is here.<br> 	And, at nightfall when ye part,<br> 	  Whispering shall say:<br> 	Love is lord of every heart,<br> 	  Love is lord of May.<br> <br> 	<i> The Ladies wander off through the wood preceded by the company <br> 	of singing maidens, whose voices grow gradually fainter as they are <br> 	lost in the distance, and at the last Guinevere follows slowly, and <br> 	as she goes off, Morgan enters, and stands gazing after her, while <br> 	at the same time Merlin appears on the rising path above.</i> <br>   MORGAN.

Not I, forsooth!<br>   MERLIN.  Thou liest, for I tracked thee in thy theft,<br> And saw thee creep beside the sleeping King,<br> Whose hand held fast that naked blade which gleamed,<br> A bar of quivering moonlight, by his side.<br> Thou hast stolen the scabbard, but no mortal hand<br> Shall take the sword.<br>   MORGAN.            What then? thyself didst say--<br> The scabbard's worth doth far outweigh the sword.<br>   MERLIN.  To him, but not to thee.  'Tis naught to thee:<br> Who steals the scabbard doth but draw the sword,<br> Who holds the sword, holds all save life, and wins,<br> Though life be spent, a deathless crown from death.<br>   MORGAN.  Whose hand shall take it then, when death draws near?<br>   MERLIN.<br> 	When those Queens of Night shall steer<br> 	Arthur's barge across the mere,<br> 	She who long ago did bring<br> 	England's sword to England's King,<br> 	  She shall claim Excalibur!<br> 	<i> Exit Merlin.</i> <br>   MORGAN.  Croak on, let Death but come; we'll chance the rest!<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Mordred.</i> <br> <br>   MORDRED.  Whose voice was that?<br>   MORGAN.                        'Twas Merlin's, who grows old,<br> And babbles like a child.  What is thy news?<br>   MORDRED.  Beyond our hope; Ryons and Mark are joined<br> In equal strength of war, and, by this hour,<br> Their glittering squadrons, like a serpent, coil<br> Around Caerleon's walls.<br>   MORGAN.               Whence got you this?<br>   MORDRED.  Sir Morys from Caerleon rode post haste<br> To warn our Master.  He will ride no more.  [<i> Touching his sword.</i> <br>   MORGAN.  'Tis well; your men keep watch on every road?<br>   MORDRED.  Ay, all are guarded, let but this day pass<br> With no unwelcome note to wake the King,<br> Then war may shriek its loudest; all is sure.<br>   MORGAN.  Hast thou forgotten Lancelot?<br>   MORDRED [<i> in alarm</i> ]<i> .</i>                  What of him?<br>   MORGAN.  Nay, track him through the wood, and thou shalt learn.<br> Come hither, see where, trembling, hand to hand,<br> With speechless answering eyes, they woo the spring.<br> Love sets the snare, but the caged bird is ours.<br> For ere night's dusky arms enfold the sun,<br> Lancelot shall be thy partner and thy slave.<br> 	<i> Exeunt Morgan and Mordred.

Nay, ask me that when May-day comes again.<br>   LAVAINE.  Ah, tell me now!<br>   CLARISSANT.               I'll tell thee all I know.<br> If thou dost woo me well, I'll love thee well,--<br> Should no one woo me better!<br>   LAVAINE.                  Wouldst thou be wooed<br> That art already won?<br>   CLARISSANT.        Most surely, sir!<br> Who holds my heart must win it every day;<br> And when 'tis won, 'tis then it must be wooed<br> And won again.<br>   LAVAINE.    Why, 'twas but yesterday<br> That thou didst swear thy love would last till death.<br>   CLARISSANT.  Ay, that was yesterday.<br>   LAVAINE.                            And shall thine oath<br> Live but an hour?<br>   CLARISSANT.    What is there in these oaths<br> That you poor men so fondly cherish them?<br> Perchance they fit your duller brains, which seek,<br> With empty words, to bind the unborn hours.<br> But we do wrong to humour you in this.<br> We should not swear at all, knowing full well<br> There's no to-morrow in a woman's heart,<br> Which hath its yesterday of joy or pain<br> Whose savour, lingering on our lips to-day,<br> Makes all the present half a memory--<br> The future all a blank.  Then ask me not<br> If I shall love thee when the year is worn;<br> I loved thee yesterday: so be content.<br>   LAVAINE.  Ah, but thou lovest to-day?<br>   CLARISSANT.                          To-day is young;<br> Ask me at sundown, I will tell thee then.<br> 	<i> Exit laughing, and he following her.</i> <br> <br> 	<i> Enter Guinevere and Lancelot.</i> <br> <br>   GUINEVERE.  The wood is dark.  Let us be in the sun.<br>   LANCELOT.  'Twas dark ere yet the glory of thy face<br> Came, like a golden message from the sun.<br> And now, beneath this open vault of day,<br> 'Twould change again to night wert thou not here.<br>   GUINEVERE.  I had a foolish fear I should not find thee.<br>   LANCELOT.  Nay, Guinevere, thou knowest that could not be.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Indeed, 'tis true, for wandering alone<br> Across the leafy screen that hedged my way,<br> From every side I heard the echoing laugh<br> Of Love's encounter.  Then the wood grew still,<br> And, softer than the silence, came the sound<br> Of whispered vows from lips but newly met;<br> And then, beneath an opening arch of green,<br> Two lovers passed, with hand in hand locked close.<br> Ah, Lancelot!  I was lonely as a child<br> Locked in a darkened room.  I called thee then;<br> Didst thou not hear me?<br>   LANCELOT.            Ay, and saw thee, too.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Thou didst not answer?<br>   LANCELOT.                         Nay, forgive me, sweet!<br> I could but watch thee.<br>   GUINEVERE.           That was cruel, sir.<br>   LANCELOT.  'Twas but an instant.<br>   GUINEVERE.                      No, it was a year!<br> And in that year a thousand thronging fears<br> With devil faces perched amid the boughs.<br>   LANCELOT.  What were thy fears?<br>   GUINEVERE.                     So many all in one:<br> That I should lose thee.<br> 	<i> Lancelot putting his arms round her.<br> </i>   LANCELOT.             Never, until death.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Ah, speak not so of death!  I have seen a face<br> That frighted me like death.<br>   LANCELOT [<i> starting</i> ]<i> .</i>     Whose face and where?<br>   GUINEVERE.  Within the wood.  'Twas Merlin's, but so old,<br> Lancelot, so old and worn I knew it not.<br>   LANCELOT.  Those empty words of his do haunt thee still.<br> I wonder at thy fears.<br>   GUINEVERE.          Nay, scold me not.<br> There's nothing haunts me when I have thee near.<br> Love shuts the door on all things save itself,<br> On all that's past and all that is to come<br> When thou art by!  Tell me, 'tis so with thee?<br>   LANCELOT.  Ay, sweet, 'tis so.<br>   GUINEVERE.                    Ah, say it once again!<br> I could not live, Lancelot, if in thy heart<br> There lurked the tiniest little ache or pain<br> Love might not cure.<br>   LANCELOT.         Thou knowest all my heart;<br> And in my love, which knows no law but love,<br> The future and the past are drowning straws<br> Caught in the full tide of our present joy,<br> That neither ebbs nor flows.<br> 	<i> He holds her in a close embrace as Morgan and <br> 	Mordred enter stealthily; at the same time is heard <br> 	the sound of distant thunder, and the scene darkens.</i> <br>   MORGAN.

Ay, 'tis he that's hatched<br> This plot against the King whereby he thinks<br> To seize the throne.<br>   GUINEVERE.        Then thou shalt prove him false<br> And save the King.<br>   LANCELOT.       I dare not.<br>   GUINEVERE.                 Dare not?<br>   LANCELOT.                           No:<br> All, all is known.<br>   GUINEVERE.      To whom?<br>   LANCELOT.               To him; he was there<br> Beside us in the may; his trait'rous hand<br> Grips at my throat and makes me traitor too.<br>   GUINEVERE.  No, no, that cannot be.  Ah, look not so!<br> What wouldst thou do?<br>   LANCELOT.          Nay, ask what have I done?<br> Was there no lamp in Heaven to stay our feet,<br> Was the night starless, that we needs must wait<br> Till love's torch, setting all the world ablaze,<br> Lights up love's ruinous way?  Ah, Guinevere,<br> I'd die a hundred deaths but now to win<br> One hour of life that's past; ay, one short hour,<br> So I might drag this devil to the throne<br> And shout his villainies in every ear.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Then do it now.<br>   LANCELOT.                  I cannot.<br>   GUINEVERE.                          Yea, thou canst!<br> Who is there that should stay thee, 'tis not I!<br> Let love go down the wind, what boots it now?<br> Look to thyself, think not of all that is lost.<br> That is all mine: there still remains<br> Thy soldier's honour, take it, keep it pure.<br>   LANCELOT.  What have I said?<br>   GUINEVERE.                  Ah, go!  [<i> Throws herself on couch.</i> <br>   LANCELOT [<i> throwing himself at her feet</i> ]<i> .</i>   My Queen!  My Queen!<br> There's nothing in the world to win or lose<br> Can count beside thy love.  I lied but now;<br> King, honour, country, all that knighthood boasts<br> Of faith and loyalty in life or death<br> Weighs not against the memory of one kiss<br> From thy dear lips.<br>   GUINEVERE.       Then thou art mine again.<br> To hear thee say that all the world was naught<br> Against our love hath made me mad for joy.<br> Yet stay not now; I have a thought to think<br> And needs must be alone.<br>   LANCELOT.             Yet, ere I go,<br> Hear this one word, all that is left of life<br> Is thine to keep or thine to fling away,<br> So I may have thy love.  [<i> Exit Lancelot.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.           Thou hast, indeed!<br> So all is won again, and all is lost!<br> So do we strive that we may have the more<br> To cast away: and now, when at my feet<br> He lays his sword, his life, ay, and his soul,<br> I do but long to find some better way<br> To give him all again; ay, all again!  [<i> Looks off.</i> <br> It is the King.  How may I find that way?<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Arthur.</i> <br> <br>   ARTHUR.  Ah, thou art here.  I bring thee such sad news<br> As needs must wring thy heart.<br>   GUINEVERE.                  What news, my lord?<br>   ARTHUR.  Elaine is dead!<br>   GUINEVERE.              Dead!  Who hath told thee this?<br>   ARTHUR.  There, yonder by the shore, her body lies<br> Who, while she lived, was named the Fair Elaine.<br> Canst thou not weep?<br>   GUINEVERE.        Truly, my lord, I think<br> I've lost the use of tears.<br>   ARTHUR.                  Thou wouldst have wept<br> Hadst thou been there when down the vacant stream<br> That black barge floated, like a speck of night,<br> Blown on the winds of dawn; and on its deck,<br> Fallen as a feather from a white dove's wing,<br> Lay this new prize of Death; whose cunning hands<br> Had wrought in such fair mimicry of life<br> That on her parted lips there lingered yet<br> The memory of a smile.<br>   GUINEVERE.          Why then, perchance,<br> She's happier far than some who needs must live<br> And smile no more.<br>   ARTHUR.         It may be; for that brow<br> Had caught from Death some secret of content<br> It knew not here, and, looking in those eyes<br> Whose tears had ceased their traffic, I dared think,<br> If aught of sin was there 'tis pardoned now.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Of sin?  What sin?<br>   ARTHUR.                       Ay, for it must be so:<br> Some sin there was though unrecorded here;<br> Some stain that smirched her seeming purity,<br> Which Lancelot, all too noble, could not urge;<br> Else were it not in nature to refuse<br> So sweet a gift.<br>   GUINEVERE.    If that indeed be true<br> Were it enough to shut the doors of love?<br>   ARTHUR.  Enough?  What wouldst thou ask?<br>   GUINEVERE.                              Ay!  Ay! enough,<br> Enough and more!  Yet, in some greater heart,<br> As his, or thine, methought that love might find<br> Forgiveness e'en for that.<br>   ARTHUR.                 Nay, wrong him not,<br> Whose upward gaze, set level with the stars,<br> Would lift from earth the soul he crowns with love,<br> Making her more than woman; whence if she fall--<br> Like some lost planet hurled from highest Heaven--<br> She falls to endless night.<br> 	<i> During Arthur's speech the distant throb of a mournful march is <br> 	heard slowly approaching.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.               Most like 'tis so,<br> And death the only way.  What sound is that?<br>   ARTHUR.  Up from the stream they bear her body hither,<br> Where it shall rest beneath this royal roof,<br> Till, with such liberal honours as befit<br> So fair a flower, 'tis set again in earth.<br> 	<i> The procession enters, headed by Mordred and Morgan.

What's that, my lord?<br>   ARTHUR.  What's here set down of Lancelot's later love.<br>   MORDRED.  Now would to Heaven those words had ne'er been writ<br> Or ne'er been read.<br>   ARTHUR.          Why so?<br>   MORDRED.                Didst thou not note<br> How the Queen's soul was stirred?<br>   ARTHUR.                        She is not used<br> To look on death; which, coming in such guise,<br> Might move our soldier hearts.<br>   MORDRED.                    Ay, but methought<br> It was Death's message and not Death itself<br> That turned those red lips white.<br>   ARTHUR.                        Mordred, what's this?<br> Think you the Queen hath known of this same love?<br>   MORDRED.  Nay, I'll not answer that.<br>   ARTHUR.                             Nay, but thou shalt.<br> What is to fear?<br>   MORDRED.      My lord, thou art my King,<br> My sword is thine, and with that sword my life;<br> But with that life my loyal service ends,<br> And what is left thou wilt not ask of me.<br>   ARTHUR.  Who is it that he loves?<br>   MORDRED.                         In sooth, I thought<br> What all the world had known was known to thee;<br> Were it not so these lips had still been dumb.<br> But now 'tis best 'twere said--he loves the Queen!  [<i> A pause.</i> <br>   ARTHUR.  Who forged this lie?  Nay, Mordred, 'tis not thou;<br> And yet I wonder, too, to find thee duped<br> By this poor tale bred in some baser soul<br> That loves not Lancelot.<br>   MORDRED.              What! thou think'st 'tis false?<br> Why then, my lord, 'tis false.  I'll think so, too,<br> We'll speak of it no more.<br>   ARTHUR.                 Ay, but we will,<br> And track this running poison to its source,<br> Which else should turn all the pure springs of life<br> To pools of festering filth.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Morgan hurriedly.</i> <br> <br>   MORGAN.

In truth 'twas so; and hath been so before;<br> Yet did I think no wrong; and now I'm sure<br> He bore some message from the King himself.<br>   ARTHUR.  No, he did not.<br>   MORGAN.

Let Lancelot speak.<br>   LANCELOT [<i> after a pause</i> ].  My lord, I bring no charge.<br>   ARTHUR.  Lancelot, think well; art sure thou know'st of naught<br> That should disturb our peace?<br>   LANCELOT [<i> after a pause</i> ]<i> .</i>   Of naught, my lord.<br>   ARTHUR.  'Tis well, 'tis well, then both of ye are true.<br>   LANCELOT.  Was it for this that thou didst send for me?<br>   ARTHUR.  Not so.

I'll tell thee, then:<br> This grave I think was Guinevere's who died<br> That hour when she was born: and these two Queens<br> Who through the night keep watch beside her tomb,<br> Are but her shadows fashioned for the masque<br> Which men call life; poor puppets that must dance<br> While unseen fingers touch the trembling strings;<br> But whence that music comes, from Heaven or Hell,<br> There's none shall say, till all life's lamps burn out<br> And Death stands forth to claim the harper's fee.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Gaoler.</i> <br> <br>   GAOLER.  Make room, Sir Mordred comes.<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Mordred.</i> <br> <br> 	<i> Exeunt Gaoler and Dagonet.</i> <br>   MORDRED.  Great Queen, I bear thee news that sets thee free.<br>   GUINEVERE.  What news is that?<br>   MORDRED.                      Thy lord, the King, is dead.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Dead! art thou sure?  Why then, sir, <i> he</i>  is free,<br> And I that was his gaoler may not weep;<br> Yet count not that against me, for I think<br> Tears are not all.<br>   MORDRED.        Truth, thou wert wrong to weep.<br> Dost thou not know 'twas Arthur's cruel will<br> That set thee in this prison?<br>   GUINEVERE.                 Ay, I know,<br> That thou hast said 'twas so.<br>   MORDRED.                  And so it is:<br> But now I've come to break these prison bars,<br> And so give back unto our desert world<br> Life's sweetest rose that hungers for the sun.<br>   GUINEVERE.  And who art thou whose new-found sovereignty<br> Rides o'er the King's decree?<br>   MORDRED.                   I am thy King.<br>   GUINEVERE.  There is no King save one, and he is dead.<br> Yet if it was his will to leave me here,<br> Why, here I'll stay.<br>   MORDRED.          Nay, then thou dost not guess<br> The gift I bear thee!  Guinevere, those lips,<br> Moulded by Love's own hand, are not yet doomed<br> For Death's embrace: their kiss is for a king;<br> Yet not like that dead lord whose bloodless soul<br> Wings to a frozen heaven: who wooes thee now<br> Is man, not god, and in his brimming veins<br> Run longings like thine own.<br>   GUINEVERE.                I thought till now<br> That I had suffered all; but here I see<br> My shame doth but begin.  'Twas not enough<br> That through my sin, for all succeeding time,<br> Hell's mocking laugh shall haunt the voice of spring,<br> And plant its poisoned echo in each bower,<br> Where lovers' vows are sworn!  Nay, this is more<br> That she, whom love doth once make false to love,<br> Must henceforth bear the common brand of lust,<br> Seeming the painted toy that every man<br> May purchase at his price.<br>   MORDRED.                Why, thou dost dream!<br> Here at thy feet I lay an empire's throne,<br> Where thou in equal majesty shalt reign<br> Once more a Queen.<br>   GUINEVERE.      A wanton, not a Queen!<br> Who for this piece of gold thou call'st a crown<br> Would take thy murderer's kiss.<br>   MORDRED.                     Nay, have a care!<br> My love lies near to hate.<br>   GUINEVERE.              I fear thy love;<br> Thy hate is naught.<br>   MORDRED.         Truth, thou shalt find it more<br> Than thou hast ever dreamed.<br> 	<i> Shouts without, "Long live the King."</i> <br>   MORDRED.                  Dost hear that cry?<br> It is the echoing voice of England's knights,<br> Who hail me king.<br>   GUINEVERE.     And they were Arthur's knights?<br>   MORDRED.  Ay, they loved Arthur well!  Yet when they learn,--<br> As so they shall, for I will vouch it true--<br> 'Twas Lancelot's sword did pierce him to the heart,<br> Their eyes will turn on her whose shameful sin<br> Made Lancelot false.  See then, thy fate stands clear,<br> Thou art Death's bride, or mine--thy choice is free.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Why then I choose to die.  Yea, though my soul<br> Slipped down to Hell, Hell were a paradise<br> Whilst thou art here.  [<i> Exit Guinevere.</i> <br>   MORDRED.           By Heaven, then thou shalt die!<br> <br> 	<i> Enter Morgan.</i> <br> <br>   MORGAN.  Ryons is trapped, and dying hath confessed<br> His treason and thine own.<br>   MORDRED.                Then Arthur lives,<br> And all is lost.<br>   MORGAN.       Nay, all is left to win;<br> This news is secret, and long ere 'tis known<br> Thy sword shall pierce his heart.<br>   MORDRED.                       Or his sword mine.<br>   MORGAN.  What, wouldst thou question Fate?<br> <br> <br> 	He Pendragon's son shall slay,<br> <br> <br> 	That is born with the May.<br> <br>                                            So Fate decreed:<br> His blood is thine and mine.<br> 	<i> Shouts "Long live King Mordred!  Death to Guinevere!" <br> grow louder to the end.</i> <br>                             Go, take thy crown,<br> And none shall dare to question what is done.<br> Or what remains to do.  [<i> Exit.</i> <br>   MORDRED.            So Fate take all!<br> To halt were death, and that on-coming flood<br> Of Time's uplifted wave can hold no more.  [<i> Exit.</i> <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SCENE 2:--<i> The Great Hall at Camelot.</i>   <i> As the scene is disclosed the Hall is filled with armed Knights.  Mordred is on the throne, accompanied by Morgan, and surrounded by the retinue of the court.</i>  <br> <i> Guinevere stands before the throne.  Mordred turns to her.</i> <br> <br>   MORDRED.  By England's knights in council thou dost stand<br> Condemned of treason 'gainst thy lord the King,<br> Whose death lies at thy charge.  Yet we, who bear<br> The crown that Arthur wore, now give thee leave<br> To plead in thy defence.  If there be aught<br> Which thou canst urge why judgment should be stayed,<br> Stand forth and speak.<br>   AGRAVAINE.          We pray you hear her not.<br>   GUINEVERE [<i> turning with a look of scorn towards Mordred</i> ].<br> What still is left to say is not for thee!<br>   MORDRED.  Then let the sentence go.  Queen Guinevere,<br> Daughter of Leodograunce of Cornwall,<br> Now hear thy judgment as the law decrees:<br> That first, despoil&egrave;d of thy royal robes,<br> Thou shalt be fastened to an iron stake<br> Until thy mortal body be consumed<br> In fiery flames.<br>   GUINEVERE.    And saith the law no more?<br>   MORDRED.  Ay, this it adds: that if thy prayer may win<br> Some champion for thy cause, then this same knight<br> Shall claim due right of battle 'gainst that lord<br> Whose charge hath brought thee here.<br>   GUINEVERE.                       And who is that?<br>   MORDRED.  'Tis I who charge thee now.<br>   GUINEVERE.                           Why then, sir knights,<br> I'll kneel and pray to you, if haply one<br> Find heart to serve his Queen.  Think not I plead<br> For this poor gift of life.  Nay, could I choose,<br> These hands should bear fresh faggots to the blaze<br> That lights me to a tomb.  Yet hear me all:<br> Who stands my knight to-day shall wrest from Time<br> A crown of glory.  Not, sirs, that he fought<br> For one whose sin knows no desert save death,<br> That were but shame: yet whoso dares that shame<br> His sword shall win the right, denied him else,<br> To slay that crawling thing upon the throne--<br> Wherefore I cry a champion for my cause!<br> 	<i> Mordred, who has descended from the throne, whispers aside.</i> <br>   MORDRED.  Too late, my Queen! too late!  What wouldst thou give<br> To win a king's kiss now?  Doth no one speak?<br> Then, herald, let the trumpet's tongue bray out<br> Her knight is gone a-hawking, or perchance<br> He sleeps too late!<br> 	<i> The trumpet sounds, and at the third call Sir Bedevere breaks <br> 	through the throng and stands before Mordred.</i> <br> <br>   BEDEVERE.  Hold there, sir herald, hither comes a knight<br> To answer for the Queen.<br>   MORDRED.              Who is this knight?<br>   BEDEVERE.  Sir, by your leave that shall be better told<br> When all is done.<br> <br> 	<i> The Knights give way, and Arthur stands alone with lowered helm.</i> <br> <br>   MORDRED.       See, madam, where he stands,<br> Thy champion who must needs have come from far,<br> To answer in such cause.<br> 	<i> Guinevere kneels at Arthur's feet.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.            I thank thee, sir,<br> Yet now I do repent me of what's done,<br> And fain would set thee free.  Put up thy sword!<br> I am not worthy that a true knight's blood<br> Should flow for me; see, I will tell thee all:<br> I had a champion once, the mightiest knight,<br> The bravest and the truest in the world.<br> He was my lord, and I his chosen Queen<br> Brought him to shame.  Then wherefore praise him now?<br> Nay, sir, I must: for that is life's hard law,<br> Which will not yield its secret till the close.<br> When Arthur went the sun shot scarlet-red,<br> And all the past lay bare.  Then pray thee, sir,<br> Put up thy sword that waits a worthier cause.<br> 	<i> A pause, but Arthur makes no sign.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE [<i> to Arthur</i> ]<i> .</i>   Thou wilt not?  <br> Then I'll ask this much of thee:<br> When death shall call thee home, it so may chance<br> That thou shalt meet my lord; if that should be,<br> Give him this word,--that at the end, his Queen<br> Knew him for what he was, true lord of all.<br>   MORDRED.  Go, lead her hence.<br>   AGRAVAINE.                   So God defend our King.<br> 	<i> Exit Guinevere, followed by Agravaine and Knights.  <br> 	Mordred turns to Arthur, who remains motionless, Morgan <br> 	watching him intently from the steps of the throne.Sir Bedevere <br> 	stands by Arthur.</i> <br>   MORDRED.  And now I'm thine: yet first, by Heaven, I'll know<br> The face beneath that mask.<br>   ARTHUR.                  'Twas kept for thee.<br> 	<i> As he lifts his helm Mordred starts back.</i> <br>   MORDRED.  The King.<br>   ARTHUR.            Ay, sir, the King, who but to win<br> This little hour from but the wreck of time,<br> Would take life's wearied hand and travel back<br> Across the ruined past, should fate declare<br> That only so his sword might claim the right<br> To slay thee now.<br>   MORDRED.       Prate on, I fear thee not.<br>   MORGAN.  Thou hast forgot the message of the May;<br> Then hear it now.<br>   ARTHUR.        Enough; 'twas thou, false witch,<br> That stole the scabbard of Excalibur!<br> Yet see, the blade remains whose every stroke<br> Is winged by Death.<br>   MORGAN.          Not so!  Not so, my lord!<br> That fickle steel shall splinter as it falls<br> On one twice armed by fate--<br> <br> 	"He Pendragon's son shall slay<br> 	That is born with the May."<br> <br>                             See! there he stands!<br>   ARTHUR.  Why then the end is here: set on, Sir Knight,<br> Death stands betwixt us twain, and Death shall choose.  <br>                   [<i> They fight and Arthur is wounded.</i> <br> Traitor, that blow ends all.  [<i> He falls to the earth.</i> <br>   MORGAN.                   Long live the King!<br> 	<i> The trumpet is heard without.</i> <br> Dost hear that sound?  Nay, look not on what's done,<br> There's more to do: her soul shall join with his<br> To wing its way across night's starless sky.<br> 	<i> Exeunt Morgan and Mordred, and as they go <br> 	they are greeted by cries from without.</i> <br>   <i> Voices</i>  [<i> without</i> ]<i> .</i>   Long live the King!<br>   ARTHUR.                                 Nay, sirs, 'tis not for long.<br> I'm dying, Bedevere.  Where is my sword?<br>   BEDEVERE.  There, in thy hand.<br>   ARTHUR.                       Poor hand, that knew it not.<br> Go quickly, Bedevere, and bear it hence<br> Unto that little bay hid in the cliff,<br> Then cast it in the sea, to wait that day<br> When upward from the shrieking waves shall spring<br> A vast sea-brood of mightier strain than ours,<br> Bearing across the world from end to end<br> One cry to all, "Our sword is in the sea."<br>   BEDEVERE.  Why, then, 'tis done.  [<i> He takes sword, and goes off.</i> <br>   ARTHUR.                         Life's tide is ebbing fast.<br> <br> 	<i> Gawaine enters hurriedly.</i> <br> <br>   GAWAINE.  Nay, what is here?  The wreck of all the world!<br>   ARTHUR.  Peace, sir, I know thy news; the Queen is dead.<br>   GAWAINE.  Not so; she lives, and thou art well avenged<br> By one who, dying, struck thy murderer down.<br>   ARTHUR.  Didst know him, Gawaine?<br>   GAWAINE.                         Ay, I knew him once.<br> The courtliest knight that ever bare a shield,<br> The sternest soldier to his mortal foe,<br> Yet gentlest of us all.<br>   ARTHUR.              Nay, sir, his name?<br>   GAWAINE.  His name, my lord, was Lancelot.<br>   ARTHUR.                                   Lancelot.  Ah!<br> So life's long night is breaking at the last.<br> <br> 	<i> Guinevere enters, while the figure of Merlin appears <br> 	standing above the recumbent form of Arthur.</i> <br> <br>   GUINEVERE.  Where is that knight who died that I might live?<br>   GAWAINE.  Hush, lady! he is here.<br> 	<i> She sees the face of Arthur and falls at his feet.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.                       My lord! my lord!<br>   ARTHUR.  Whose face was there?  I pray you, some one say,<br> For all grows dark: I know not where I am.<br>   GUINEVERE.  Her name was Guinevere.<br>   ARTHUR.                            What, sirs? why then,<br> This should be Cameliard.  [<i> Rousing himself with sudden energy.</i> ]  <br> See, 'tis the spring!<br> Down in the vale the blossoms of the May<br> Are swinging in the sun! and there she stands<br> That shall be England's Queen!<br>                               Far up I hear<br> The ceaseless beating of Death's restless wing,<br> And round mine eyes the circling veil of night<br> Grows deeper as it falls.  Henceforth my sword<br> Rests in its scabbard.  What remains is peace.  <br>                      [<i> He falls back dead.</i> <br>   GUINEVERE.  He's gone, the light of all the world lies dead.<br> 	<i> The stage darkens, leaving a light only on the face of Merlin.</i> <br>   MERLIN.  Not so, he doth but pass who cannot die,<br> The King that was, the King that yet shall be;<br> Whose spirit, borne along from age to age,<br> Is England's to the end.  Look where the dawn<br> Sweeps through a wider heaven, and on its wings<br> By those three Queens of night his barge is borne<br> To that sweet Isle of Avalon whose sleep<br> Can heal all earthly wounds.<br> 	<i> During this speech, the stage grows darker, and as the <br> 	vision appears, at the back, of Arthur borne in the barge, <br> 	with the three Queens bending over his body, the chorus <br> 	breaks out, and continues till the end.</i> <br> <br> 		   CHORUS<br> 	Sleep! oh sleep! till night outworn<br> 	Wakens to the echoing horn<br> 	That shall greet thee King new-born,<br> 	King that was, and is to be.<br> <br> 	And a voice from shore to shore<br> 	Cries, "Arise, and sleep no more,<br> 	Greet the dawn, the night is o'er,<br> 	  England's sword is in the sea."<br> <br> <br> <br>
