while 'tis morning hour<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woodland brook we needs must pass;<br>  So, ere the sun assume his power,<br>  We shelter in our poplar bower,<br>  Where dew lies long upon the flower,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though vanish'd from the velvet grass.<br>  Curbing the stream, this stony ridge<br>  May serve us for a silvan bridge;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For here, compell'd to disunite,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round petty isles the runnels glide,<br>  And chafing off their puny spite,<br>  The shallows murmurers waste their might,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielding to footstep free and light<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dry-shod pass from side to side.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.<br>  Nay, why this hesitating pause?<br>  And, Lucy, as thy step withdraws,<br>  Why sidelong eye the streamlet's brim?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titania's foot without a slip,<br>  Like, thine, though timid, light, and slim,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From stone to stone might safely trip,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor risk the glow-worm clasp to dip<br>  That binds her slipper's silken rim.<br>  Or trust thy lover's strength; nor fear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this same stalwart arm of mine,<br>  Which could yon oak's prone trunk uprear,<br>  Shall shrink beneath, the burden dear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of form so slender, light, and fine;<br>  So!

rest thee on thy wonted seat;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moss'd is the stone, the turf is green,<br>  A place where lovers best may meet<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would not that their love be seen.<br>  The boughs, that dim the summer sky,<br>  Shall hide us from each lurking spy,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fain would spread the invidious tale,<br>  How Lucy of the lofty eye,<br>  Noble in birth, in fortunes high,<br>  She for whom lords and barons sigh,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meets her poor Arthur in the dale.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.<br>  How deep that blush! -- how deep that sigh!<br>  And why does Lucy shun mine eye?<br>  Is it because that crimson draws<br>  Its colour from some secret cause,<br>  Some hidden movement of the breast<br>  She would not that her Arthur guess'd?<br>  O! quicker far is lovers' ken<br>  Than the dull glance of common men,<br>  And, by strange sympathy, can spell<br>  The thoughts the loved one will not tell!<br>  And mine, in Lucy's blush, saw met<br>  The hues of pleasure and regret;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pride mingled in the sigh her voice,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shared with Love the crimson glow;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well pleased that thou art Arthur's choice,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet shamed thine own is placed so low:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou turn'st thy self-confessing cheek,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to meet the breeze's cooling:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Lucy, hear thy tutor speak,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Love, too, has his hours of schooling.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.<br>  Too oft my anxious eye has spied<br>  That secret grief thou fain wouldst hide,<br>  The passing pang of humbled pride;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too oft, when through the splendid hall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The load-star of each heart and eye,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fair one leads the glittering ball,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will her stol'n glance on Arthur fall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a blush and such a sigh!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wouldst not yield, for wealth or rank,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart thy worth and beauty won,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor leave me on this mossy bank,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet a rival on a throne:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, then, should vain repinings rise,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That to thy lover fate denies<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nobler name, a wide domain, <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Baron's birth, a menial train,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Heaven assign'd him, for his part,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lyre, a falchion, and a heart?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI.<br>  My sword -- its master must be dumb;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, when a soldier names my name,<br>  Approach, my Lucy! fearless come,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor dread to hear of Arthur's shame.<br>  My heart! 'mid all yon courtly crew<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lordly rank and lofty line,<br>  Is there to love and honour true,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That boasts a pulse so warm as mine?<br>  They praised thy diamonds' lustre rare --<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Match'd with thine eyes, I thought it faded;<br>  They praised the pearls that bound thy hair--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw only the locks they braided;<br>  They talk'd of wealthy dower and land,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And titles of high birth the token --<br>  I thought of Lucy's heart and hand,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor knew the sense of what was spoken.<br>  And yet, if rank'd in Fortune's roll,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have learn'd their choice unwise,<br>  Who rate the dower above the soul,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucy's diamonds o'er her eyes.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII.<br>  My lyre -- it is an idle toy,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That borrows accents not its own,<br>  Like warbler of Colombian sky,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sings in a mimic tone.<br>  Ne'er did it sound o'er sainted well,<br>  Nor boasts it aught of Border spell;<br>  It strings no feudal slogan pour,<br>  Its heroes draw no broad claymore;<br>  No shouting clans applauses raise,<br>  Because it sung their father's praise;<br>  On Scottish moor, or English down,<br>  It ne'er was graced with fair renown;<br>  Norwon -- best meed to minstrel true --<br>  One favouring smile from fair BUCCLEUCH!<br>  By one poor streamlet sounds its tone,<br>  And heard by one dear maid alone.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.<br>  But, if thou bid'st, these tones shall tell<br>  Of errant knight, and damozelle;<br>  Of a dread knot a Wizard tied,<br>  In punishment of maiden's pride,<br>  In notes of marvel and of fear,<br>  That best may charm romantic ear.<br>  For Lucy loves (like COLLINS, ill-starred name,<br>  Whose lay's requital was that tardy fame,<br>  Who bound no laurel round his living head,<br>  Should hang it o'er his monument when dead)<br>  For Lucy loves to tread enchanted strand,<br>  And thread, like him, the maze of fairy land;<br>  Of golden battlements to view the gleam,<br>  And slumber soft by some Elysian stream;<br>  Such lays she loves; and, such my Lucy's choice,<br>  What other song can claim her Poet's voice?<br>  <br>  <b> Canto First.</b> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.<br>  Where is the maiden of mortal strain<br>  That may match with the Baron of Triermain?<br>  She must be lovely, and constant, and kind,<br>  Holy and pure, and humble of mind,<br>  Blithe of cheer, and gentle of mood,<br>  Courteous, and generous, and noble of blood,<br>  Lovely as the sun's first ray<br>  When it breaks the clouds of an April day;<br>  Constant and true as the widow'd dove,<br>  Kind as a minstrel that sings of love;<br>  Pure as the fountain in rocky cave,<br>  Where never sunbeam kiss'd the wave;<br>  Humble as a maiden that loves in vain,<br>  Holy as a hermit's vesper strain;<br>  Gentle as a breeze that but whispers and dies,<br>  Yet blithe as the light leaves that dance in its sighs;<br>  Courteous as monarch the morn he is crown'd,<br>  Generous as spring-dews that bless the glad ground;<br>  Noble her blood as the currents that met<br>  In the veins of the noblest Plantangenet:<br>  Such must her form be, her mood and her strain,<br>  That shall match with Sir Roland of Triermain.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.<br>  Sir Roland de Vaux he hath laid him to sleep,<br>  His blood it was fever'd, his breathing was deep.<br>  He had been pricking against the Scot,<br>  The foray was long, and the skirmish hot;<br>  His dinted helm and his buckler's plight<br>  Bore token of a stubborn fight.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in the castle must hold them still,<br>  Harpers must lull him to his rest<br>  With the slow soft tunes he loves the best,<br>  Till sleep sink down upon his breast<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the dew on a summer hill.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III.<br>  It was the dawn of an autumn day;<br>  The sun was struggling with a frost-fog grey,<br>  That like a silvery crape was spread<br>  Round Skiddaw's dim and distant head,<br>  And faintly gleam'd each painted pane<br>  Of the lordly halls of Triermain,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that Baron bold awoke.<br>  Starting he woke, and loudly did call,<br>  Rousing his menials in bower and hall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hastily he spoke.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV.<br>  'Hearken, my minstrels! which of ye all<br>  Touch'd his harp with that dying fall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweet, so soft, so faint,<br>  It seem'd an angel's whisper'd call<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an expiring saint?<br>  And harken, my merry men! what time or where<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she pass, that maid with her heavenly brow,<br>  With her look so sweet and her eyes so fair,<br>  And her graceful step and her angel air,<br>  And the eagle plume in her dark-brown hair,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pass'd from my bower e'en now?'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V.<br>  Answer'd him Richard de Bretville -- he<br>  Was chief of the Baron's minstrelsy:<br>  'Silent, noble chieftain, we<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have sat since midnight close,<br>  When such lulling sounds as the brooklet sings<br>  Murmur'd from our melting strings<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hush'd you to repose.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a harp-note sounded here<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had caught my watchful ear,<br>  Although it fell as faint and shy<br>  As bashful maiden's half-form'd sigh,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she thinks her lover near.'<br>  Answer'd Philip of Fasthwaite tall --<br>  He kept guard in the outer hall:<br>  'Since at eve our watch took post,<br>  Not a foot has thy portal cross'd;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else had I heard the steps, though low<br>  And light they fell, as when the earth receives, <br>  In morn of frost, the wither'd leaves<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drop when no winds blow.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI.<br>  'Then come thou hither, Henry, my page,<br>  Whom I saved from the sack of Hermitage,<br>  When that dark castle, tower, and spire,<br>  Rose to the skies a pile of fire.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made the warrior's heart-blood chill.<br>  The trustiest thou of all my train,<br>  My fleetest courser thou must rein,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ride to Lyulph's tower,<br>  And from the Baron of Treirmain<br>

lyres<br>  To Arthur's and Pendragon's praise,<br>  And his who sleeps at Dunmailraise.<br>  Gifted like his gifted race,<br>  He the characters can trace,<br>  Graven deep in elder time,<br>  Upon Helvellyn's cliffs sublime;<br>  Sign and sigil well doth he know,<br>  And can bode of weal and woe,<br>  Of kingdoms' fall, and fate of wars,<br>  From mystic dreams and course of stars.<br>  He shall tell if middle earth,<br>  To that enchanting shape gave birth,<br>  Of if t'was but an airy thing,<br>  Such as fantastic slumbers bring,<br>  Fram'd from the rainbow's varying dyes<br>  Or fading tints of western skies.<br>  For, by the Blessed Rood I swear,<br>  If that fair form breathe vital air,<br>  No other maiden by my side<br>  Shall ever rest De Vaux's bride!'<br>  <br>

faithful Page he mounts his steed,<br>  And soon he cross'd green Irthing's mead,<br>  Dash'd o'er Kirkoswald's verdant plain,<br>  And Eden barr'd his course in vain.<br>  He pass'd red Penrith's Table Round,<br>  For feats of chivalry renown'd.<br>  Left Mayburgh's mound and stones of power,<br>  By Druid's raised in magic hour,<br>  And traced the Eamont's winding way,<br>  Till Ulfo's lake beneath him lay.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.<br>  Onward he rode, the pathway still<br>  Winding betwixt the lake and hill;<br>  Till, on the fragment of a rock,<br>  Struck from its base by lightning shock,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the hoary Sage;<br>  The silver moss and lichen twined,<br>  With fern and deer-hair check'd and lined,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cushion fit for age;<br>  And o'er him shook the aspen-tree,<br>  A restless, rustling canopy.<br>  Then sprung young Henry from his selle,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And greeted Lyulph grave;<br>  And then his master's tale did tell,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then for counsel crave.<br>  The Man of Years mused long and deep,<br>  Of time's lost treasures taking keep,<br>  And then, as rousing from a sleep,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His solemn answer gave.<br>  <br>

Above his solitary track<br>  Rose Glaramara's ridgy back, <br>  Amid whose yawning gulfs the sun<br>  Cast umber'd radiance red and dun,<br>  Though never sunbeam could discern<br>  The surface of

Save that the crags so rudely piled,<br>  At distance seen, resemblance wild<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a rough fortress

its curve careering fast,<br>  Before the fury of the blast<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midnight clouds are driven.<br>  The

--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a thought of fear.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII.<br>  But lively was the mingled thrill<br>  That chased that momentary chill,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Love's keen wish was there,<br>  And eager Hope, and Valour high,<br>  And the proud glow of Chivalry,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That burn'd to do and dare.<br>  Forth from the cave the warrior rush'd,<br>  Long ere the mountain-voice was hush'd,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That answer'd to the knell;<br>  For long and far the unwonted sound,<br>  Eddying in echoes round and round,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was toss'd from fell to fell;<br>  And Glaramara answer flung,<br>  And Grisdale-pike responsive rung,<br>  And Legbert heights their echoes swung<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Derwent's dell.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.<br>  Forth upon trackless darkness gazed<br>  The Knight, bedeafen'd and amazed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all was hush'd and still.<br>  Save the swoln torrent's sullen roar,<br>  And the night-blast that wildly bore<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its course along the hill.<br>  Then on the northern sky there came<br>  A light, as of reflected flame,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over Legbert-head,<br>  As if by magic art controll'd,<br>  A mighty meteor slowly roll'd<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its orb of fiery red;<br>  Thou wouldst have thought some demon dire<br>  Came, mounted on that car of fire,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do his errand dread.<br>  Far on the sloping valley's course,<br>  On thicket, rock, and torrent hoarse,<br>  Shingle and Scrae, and Fell and Force,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dusky light arose:<br>  Display'd, yet alter'd was the scene;<br>  Dark rock, and brook of silver sheen,<br>  Even the gay thicket's summer green,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bloody tincture glows.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX.<br>  De Vaux had mark'd the sunbeams set,<br>  At eve, upon the coronet<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that enchanted mound,<br>  And seen but crags at random flung,<br>  That, o'er the brawling torrent hung,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In desolation frown'd.<br>  What sees he by that meteor's lour?<br>  A banner'd Castle, keep, and tower,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the lurid gleam,<br>  With battled walls and buttress fast,<br>  And barbican and ballium vast,<br>  And airy flanking towers, that cast<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows on the stream.<br>  'Tis no deceit! distinctly clear<br>  Crenell and parapet appear,<br>  While o'er the pile that meteor drear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes momentary pause;<br>  Then forth its solemn path it drew,<br>  And fainter yet and fainter grew<br>  Those gloomy towers upon the view,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As its wild light withdraws.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X.<br>  Forth from the cave did Roland rush,<br>  O'er crag and stream, through brier and bush;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet far he had not sped<br>  Ere sunk was that portentous light<br>  Behind the hills, and utter night<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was on the valley spread.<br>  He paused perforce, and blew his horn,<br>  And on the mountain-echoes borne<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard an answering sound,<br>  A wild and lonely trumpet-note;<br>  In middle air it seem'd to float<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High o'er the battled mound;<br>  And sounds were heard, as when a guard<br>  Of some proud castle, holding ward,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pace forth their nightly round.<br>  The valiant Knight of Triermain<br>  Rung forth his challenge-blast again,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But answer came there none;<br>  And 'mid the mingled wind and rain,<br>  Darkling he sought the vale in vain,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the dawning shone;<br>  And when it dawn'd, that wondrous sight,<br>  Distinctly seen by meteor light --<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all had pass'd away;<br>  And that enchanted mount once more<br>  A pile of granite fragments bore,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the close of day.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI.<br>  Steel'd for the dead, De Vaux's heart<br>  Scorn'd from his vent'rous quest to part<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walks the vale once more;<br>  But only sees, by night or day,<br>  That shatter'd pile of rocks so grey,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hears but the torrent's roar.<br>  Till when, through hills of azure borne,<br>  The moon renew'd her silver horn,<br>  Just at the time her waning ray,<br>  Had faded in the dawning day,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summer mist arose;<br>  Adown the vale the vapours float,<br>  And cloudy undulations moat<br>  That tufted mound of mystic note,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As round its base they close.<br>  And higher now the fleecy tide<br>  Ascends its stern and shaggy side,<br>  Until the airy billows hide<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock's majestic isle;<br>  It seem'd a veil of filmy lawn,<br>  By some fantastic fairy drawn<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around enchanted pile.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII.<br>  The breeze came softly down the brook,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, sighing as it blew,<br>  The veil of silver mist it shook,<br>  And to De Vaux's eager look<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renew'd that wondrous view.<br>  For, though the loitering vapour braved<br>  The gentle breeze, yet oft it waved<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mantle dewy fold;<br>  And still, when shook that filmy screen,<br>  Were towers and bastions dimly seen,<br>  And Gothic battlements between<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their gloomy length unroll'd.<br>  Speed, speed, De Vaux, ere on thine eye<br>  Once more the fleeting vision die!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gallant knight 'gan speed<br>  As prompt and light as, when the hound<br>  Is opening, and the horn is wound,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careers the hunter's steed.<br>  Down the steep dell his course amain<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath rivall'd archer's shaft;<br>  But ere the mound he could attain,<br>  The rocks their shapeless form regain,<br>  And, mocking loud his labour vain,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain spirits laugh'd.<br>  Far up the echoing dell was borne<br>  Their wild unearthly shout of scorn.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII.<br>  Wroth wax'd the Warrior: 'Am I then<br>  Fool'd by the enemies of men,<br>  Like a poor hind, whose homeward way<br>  Is haunted by malicious fay?<br>  Is Triermain become your taunt,<br>  De Vaux your scorn?  False fiends, avaunt!'<br>  A weighty curtal-axe he bare;<br>  The baleful blade so bright and square,<br>  And the tough shaft of heben wood,<br>  Were oft in Scottish gore imbrued.<br>  Backward his stately form he drew,<br>  And at the rocks the weapon threw,<br>  Just where one crag's projected crest<br>  Hung proudly balanced o'er the rest.<br>  Hurl'd with main force, the weapon's shock<br>  Rent a huge fragment of the rock.<br>  If by mere strength, 'twere hard to tell,<br>  Or if the blow dissolved some spell,<br>  But down the headlong ruin came,<br>  With cloud of dust and flash of flame.<br>  Down bank, o'er bush, its course was borne,<br>  Crush'd lay the copse, the earth was torn,<br>  Till staid at length, the ruin dread<br>  Cumber'd the torrent's rocky bed,<br>  And bade the water's high-swoln tide<br>  Seek other passage for its pride.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIV.<br>  When ceased that thunder, Triermain<br>  Survey'd the mound's rude front again;<br>  And, lo! the ruin had laid bare,<br>  Hewn in the stone, a winding stair,<br>  Whose moss'd and fractured steps might lend<br>  The means the summit to ascend;<br>  And by whose aid the brave De Vaux<br>  Began to scale these magic rocks,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon a platform won,<br>  Where, the wild witchery to close,<br>  Within three lances' length arose<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Castle of Saint John!<br>  No misty phantom of the air,<br>  No meteor-blazoned show was there;<br>  In morning splendour, full and fair,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive fortress shone.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XV.<br>  Embattled high and proudly tower'd,<br>  Shaded by pond'rous flankers, lower'd<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal's gloomy way.<br>  Though for six hundred years and more<br>  Its strength had brook'd the tempest's roar,<br>  The scutcheon'd emblems which it bore<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had suffer'd no decay:<br>  But from the eastern battlement<br>  A turret had made sheer descent,<br>  And, down in recent ruin rent,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-torrent lay.<br>  Else, o'er the Castle's brow sublime,<br>  Insults of violence or of time<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfelt had pass'd away.<br>  In shapeless characters of yore,<br>  The gate this stern inscription bore: --<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVI.<br>  'Patience waits the destined day,<br>  Strength can clear the cumber'd way.<br>  Warrior, who hast waited long,<br>  Firm of soul, of sinew strong,<br>  It is given to thee to gaze<br>  On the pile of ancient days.<br>  Never mortal builder's hand<br>  This enduring fabric plann'd;<br>  Sign and sigil, word of power,<br>  From the earth raised keep and tower.<br>  View it o'er, and pace it round,<br>  Rampart, turret, battled mound.<br>  Dare no more!  To cross the gate<br>  Were to tamper with thy fate;<br>  Strength and fortitude were vain,<br>  View it o'er -- and turn again.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XVII.<br>  'That would I,' said the Warrior bold,<br>  'If that my frame were bent and old,<br>  And my thin blood dropp'd slow and cold<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As icicle in thaw;<br>  But while my heart can feel it dance,<br>  Blithe as the sparkling wine of France,<br>  And this good arm wields sword or lance,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mock these words of awe!'<br>  He said; the wicket felt the sway<br>  Of his strong hand, and straight gave way,<br>  And, with rude crash and jarring bray,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rusty bolts withdraw;<br>  But o'er the threshold as he strode,<br>  And forward took the vaulted road,<br>  An unseen arm, with force amain,<br>  The ponderous gate flung close again,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rusted bolt and bar<br>  Spontaneous took their place once more,<br>  While the deep arch with sullen roar<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return'd their surly jar.<br>  'Now closed is the gin and the prey within<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Rood of Lanercost!<br>  But he that would win the war-wolf's skin<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May rue him of his boast.'<br>  Thus muttering, on the Warrior went,<br>  By dubious light down deep descent.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII.<br>  Unbarr'd, unlock'd, unwatch'd, a port<br>  Led to the Castle's outer court:<br>  There the main fortress, broad and tall,<br>  Spread its long range of bower and hall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And towers of varied size,<br>  Wrought with each ornament extreme<br>  That Gothic art, in wildest dream<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fancy, could devise;<br>  But full between the Warrior's way<br>  And the main portal arch, there lay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inner moat;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor bridge nor boat<br>  Affords De Vaux the means to cross<br>  The clear, profound, and silent fosse.<br>  His arms aside in haste he flings,<br>  Cuirass of steel and hauberk rings,<br>  And down falls helm, and down the shield,<br>  Rough with the dints of many a field.<br>  Fair was his manly form, and fair<br>  His keen dark eye, and close curl'd hair,<br>  When, all unarm'd, save that the brand<br>  Of well-proved metal graced his hand,<br>  With nought to fence his dauntless breast<br>  But the close gipon's under-vest,<br>  Whose sullied buff the sable stains<br>  Of hauberk and of mail retains,<br>  Roland De Vaux upon the brim<br>  Of the broad moat stood prompt to swim.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIX.<br>  Accoutred thus he dared the tide,<br>  And soon he reach'd the farther side,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And enter'd soon the hold,<br>  And paced a hall, whose wall so wide<br>  Were blazon'd all with feats of pride,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By warriors done of old.<br>  In middle lists they counter'd here,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While trumpets seem'd to blow;<br>  And there, in den or desert drear'<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quell'd gigantic foe,<br>  Braved the fierce griffon in his ire,<br>  Or faced the dragon's breath of fire.<br>  Strange in their arms, and strange in face,<br>  Heroes they seem'd of ancient race,<br>  Whose deeds of arms, and race, and name,<br>  Forgotten long by later fame,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were here depicted, to appal<br>  Those of an age degenerate,<br>  Whose bold intrusion braved their fate<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this enchanted hall.<br>  For some short space the venturous knight<br>  With these high marvels fed his sight,<br>  Then sought the chamber's upper end,<br>  Where three broad easy steps ascend<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To an arch'd portal door,<br>  In whose broad folding leaves of state<br>  Was framed a wicket window-grate,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, ere he ventured more,<br>  The gallant Knight took earnest view<br>  The grated wicket-window through.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XX.<br>  Oh, for his arms!  Of martial weed<br>  Had never mortal Knight such need!<br>  He spied a stately gallery; all<br>  Of snow-white marble was the wall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vaulting, and the floor;<br>  And, contrast strange! on either hand<br>  There stood array'd in sable band<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four maids whom Afric bore;<br>  And each a bright Lybian tiger led,<br>  Held by as bright and frail a thread<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lucy's golden hair, --<br>  For the leash that bound these monsters dread<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was but of gossam&egrave;r.<br>  Each  maiden's short barbaric vest<br>  Left all unclosed the knee and breast,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And limbs of shapely jet;<br>  White was their vest and turban's fold,<br>  On arms and ankles rings of gold<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In savage pomp were set;<br>  A quiver on their shoulders lay,<br>  And in their hand an assagay.<br>  Such and so silent stood they there,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Roland wellnigh hoped<br>  He saw a band of statues rare,<br>  Station'd the gazer's soul to scare;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the wicket oped,<br>  Each grisley beast 'gan upward draw,<br>  Roll'd his grim eye, and spread his claw,<br>  Scented the air, and licked his jaw;<br>  While these weird maids, in Moorish tongue,<br>  A wild and dismal warning sung.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXI.<br>
