Once again<br> The dripping oar dipped in its silver blade,<br> Parting the waves, as smiles part beauty's lips.<br> Betwixt me and the curtain of the cloud,<br> Close down by the horizon's verge, there crept<br> From out the darkness, barge and crew and freight,<br> Sailless and voiceless, all!<br> 			Ah!  Then I knew<br> I stood upon the brink of Time.  I saw<br> Before me Death's swift river sweep along<br> And bear its burden to the grave.<br> 			"Elaine!"<br> One seamew screamed, in solitary woe;<br> "Elaine!  Elaine!" stole back the echo, weird<br> And musical, from off the further shore.<br> Then burst a chorus wild, "Elaine!  Elaine!"<br> And gazing upward through the twilight haze,<br> Mine eyes beheld King Arthur's phantom Court.<br> There stood the sturdy monarch: he who drove<br> The hordes of Hengist from old Albion's strand;<br> And, leaning on his stalwart arm, his queen,<br> The fair, the false, but trusted Guinevere!<br> And there, like the statue of a demi-god,<br> In marble wrought by some old Grecian hand,<br> With eyes downcast, towered Lancelot of the Lake.<br> Lavaine and Torre, the heirs of Astolat,<br> And he, the sorrowing Sire of the Dead,<br> Together with a throng of valiant knights<br> And ladies fair, were gathered as of yore,<br> At the Round Table of bold Arthur's Court.<br> There, too, was Tristram, leaning on his lance,<br> Whose eyes alone of all that weeping host<br> Swam not in tears; but indignation burned<br> Red in their sockets, like volcanic fires,<br> And from their blazing depths a Fury shot<br> Her hissing arrows at the guilty pair.<br> Then Lancelot, advancing to the front,<br> With glance transfixed upon the canvas true<br> That sheds immortal fame on ROSENTHAL,<br> Thus chanted forth his Requiem for the Dead:<br> <br> Fresh as the water in the fountain,<br>    Fair as the lily by its side,<br> Pure as the snow upon the mountain,<br> 	Is the angel<br> 	   Elaine!<br> 	My spirit bride!<br> <br> Day after day she grew fairer,<br>    As she pined away in sorrow, at my side;<br> No pearl in the ocean could be rarer<br> 	Than the angel<br> 	   Elaine!<br> 	My spirit bride!<br> <br> The hours passed away all unheeded,<br>    For love hath no landmarks in its tide.<br> No child of misfortune ever pleaded<br> 	      In vain<br> 	   To Elaine!<br> 	My spirit bride!<br> <br> Here, where sad Tamesis is rolling<br>    The wave of its sorrow-laden tide,<br> Forever on the air is heard tolling<br> 	The refrain<br> 	Of Elaine!<br> 	My spirit bride!<br>
