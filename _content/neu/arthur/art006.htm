But since<br>  To no man living perfect wisdom comes<br>  It hapt therefore, that in one thing, not small,<br>  Sir Guy, the sage was wanting, and the King<br>  To him had that day put a question hard.<br>  <br>  "How chances it, Sir Guy," had Arthur said,<br>  "That thou whom all men reverently call<br>  The wisest of our court, now Merlin lies<br>  A pris'ner in the wood of Broceliande,<br>  Hast fail'd, or so it seemeth to our eyes,<br>  To rule and govern well thine only son?"<br>  He ceas'd and then, from out a passage close<br>  Beside, a woman came and stood before<br>  And cried:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O king, who never yet wouldst see<br>  And willingly, injustice done to aught,<br>  Hearken to me.  But now my son, in years<br>  Scarce ten and slender as a flower, was set<br>  Upon and beaten by a lad, the son,<br>  It hap'neth, of thy wisest knight, Sir Guy,<br>  And therefore may it please thee, noble King,<br>  To see that this young Thomas, for so him<br>  They call, be dealt with sternly, as is sure<br>  His due."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spoke in haste, not seeing him<br>  Who stood beside the king, and courteously<br>  Made Arthur answer to her, and she went<br>  From out the kingly presence glad of heart.<br>  When the last echo of her steps had ceas'd,<br>  The King again to his companion turn'd<br>  Repeating in the glances of his eyes<br>  The question that before was ask'd with lips.<br>  Stroking his chin in thought, Sir Guy abode<br>  In silence for a space, then, sudden, flasht<br>  A face of mirthful radiance on the King,<br>  And begg'd his lord would listen to a tale.<br>  "Full willingly, Sir Guy," replied the King,<br>  And smooth'd the gilded dragon on his robe.<br>  <br>  "A peasant in the land of Cameliard,"<br>  Began Sir Guy, "a slender living won<br>  By keeping ducks and geese, and round his hut<br>  Their constant screams and quackings harshly rang<br>  From earliest hours,--sweet music to his ears.<br>  One spring it chanced that from the nest two geese<br>  Came off at once leading their callow young.<br>  One mother proudly walk'd in front of ten<br>  Yellow as gold, and all submissively<br>  They follow'd where she led, nor seem'd to dream<br>  Of will apart from hers.  The other goose<br>  Was mother of but one, and this one black<br>  And wayward, such as never had been seen.<br>  In vain the mother strove obedience<br>  From this to gain; and oft her comrades shook<br>  Their heads, foreboding ills that lay in wait<br>  For errant goslings that obey'd no law.<br>  At last the mother strove no more but left<br>  Her single gosling to its own wild will:<br>  But when a year had gone the peasant saw<br>  No finer bird amongst his flock than this<br>  Of which such dire prediction had been made.<br>  But she that led abroad her brood of ten<br>  Ere summer ended saw them fall a prey<br>  To enemies that lurkt in grass and pool,<br>  And one by one they slowly disappear'd<br>  Till autumn came and found her desolate."<br>  <br>  "A clever tale," here spoke the King, and smil'd<br>  "But all things are not rul'd by accident,<br>  Sir Guy, and seldom from the thorns do men<br>  Attempt the purple-cluster'd grape to pluck,<br>  And this, Sir Guy, the wise, should know as well,<br>  Or better, even, than the King himself."<br>  Then, rising, Arthur past with thoughtful step<br>  Unto the bower of Guinevere, his Queen.<br>  <br>  Thomas the young, Thomas the mischievous,<br>  Awak'ning on the morrow from his sleep,<br>  Beheld from out the windows of his room<br>  A sight that fill'd his bosom with delight,<br>  For while as down the narrow street he glanced,<br>  A well-fed sow, attended by the train<br>  Of youthful swine that made her litter small,<br>  With grunts of deep content slow rang'd along.<br>  A moment only gaz'd the lad, then stole<br>  With soundless steps down the long stair, and peer'd<br>  Into the street without.  In narrow lines<br>  Thro' rifts between high houses shone the sun<br>  And lay in golden bars across the street.<br>  A soft breeze lifted banners from the walls<br>  And tost them lightly in the air.  Scarce had<br>  The city wak'd, and only here and there<br>  An early-risen scullion, rubbing eyes<br>  In which the sleep yet linger'd, went his way<br>  To morning task.  The lagging steps of these<br>  And noise of swine the only sounds that stirr'd<br>  The silence of the town.  All cautiously<br>  The lad with careful feet, on mischief bent<br>  Crept toward the trustful, unsuspicious swine,<br>  But, as his shadow fell across a bar<br>  Of gold, the mother felt the danger near,<br>  And, shrieking, fled, with all her litter'd tribe<br>  At heels.  But one, the smallest, tenderest<br>  Of all, because less swift of foot than all<br>  The rest, the ruthless Thomas seiz'd and bore<br>  Triumphant to his friend, the palace cook,<br>  The twain intending later on the pig<br>  To dine.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ill reckon'd they, the knavish pair,<br>  For wily Vivien thro' her lattice saw<br>  The theft, and so, because she lov'd to tell<br>  A tale, and more because the lad had been<br>  Full oft a torment to her, later went<br>  And told King Arthur what the son of Guy<br>  Had done.  The blameless King when he her tale<br>  In silence heard, not doubting that for once<br>  She spoke the truth, bade some one call Sir Guy<br>  And Tom, and summon likewise all the court.<br>  When this was done the King upon Sir Guy<br>  Bent brows of sudden wrath and said:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy 'one<br>  Black gosling,' O Sir Guy, in growing up<br>  To be the chiefest goose, or what thou wilt,<br>  Of all his time, is like, I fear me much,<br>  To prove a very fruitful source of ill<br>  Among the youth of tender age at court."<br>  To this in humbleness Sir Guy replied:<br>  "It may be as thou sayest; therefore do<br>  Unto him as thou wilt."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then call'd the King<br>  Sir Kay, the seneschal, and gave command<br>  That at the stroke of noon Sir Kay should lay<br>  On thieving Thomas full twelve stripes with rod<br>  Of season'd birch; and hearing this, a smile<br>  Of joy ran round the court, and no one rais'd<br>  A voice of pity, for none pitied him.<br>  Then as Sir Kay the luckless Thomas led<br>  From out the presence of the court and King,<br>  The wily Vivien past to where the cooks<br>  And scullions bode and singling out the one<br>  She knew to be the friend of Thomas, drew<br>  From him with all her wondrous woman's art<br>  The after hist'ry of the stolen pig.<br>  Won by the damsel's smile, before he knew,<br>  The cook, a simple knave and all unus'd<br>  To arts like these of Vivien's, promise gave<br>  That he at noon the roasted pig would place<br>  Upon the table in her private bower,<br>  For on such fare full well she lov'd to dine.<br>  The promise made again she smil'd and seem'd<br>  As innocently fair as Enid, wife<br>  To Prince Geraint, and, dazzl'd by such grace<br>  To him, a kitchen servingman, he stood<br>  With floury hands on hips and open mouth,<br>  And wide eyes staring as she past without.<br>  <br>  Thomas the young, Thomas the mischievous,<br>  With dark anticipation watcht the sun<br>  As rapidly it clomb the morning sky,<br>  And much too short the time till from the tow'rs<br>  Was clasht the hour of noon, but to the maid<br>  The hours paced slow, and oft she sigh'd for noon<br>  Impatiently exclaiming to herself<br>  That never had been known a morn so long.<br>  But when, on platter hot, the cook the pig<br>  Brought it, her humor chang'd and thereupon<br>  Grew all as sweet as breath of flowers in June.<br>  Low bow'd the man as she within his palm<br>  A gold'n token slipt from fingers white,<br>  The while he heard her voice his cooking praise,<br>  And felt the magic of her presence near<br>  And vainly wish'd himself of her degree;<br>  For breath of scandal soiling Vivien's name<br>  Had not so far as palace kitchen blown,<br>  And therefore deem'd he still the damsel pure.<br>  <br>  Long linger'd she o'er this her fav'rite dish,<br>  And none the less 'twas sweet to her who knew<br>  That high above the tumult of the streets<br>  Below, in direful anguish, rang the shrieks<br>  Of Tom.<br>
