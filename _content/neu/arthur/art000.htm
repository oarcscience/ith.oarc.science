But on that day<br>  The butcher, baker, chandler, and the host<br>  That prosper'd on the waste and riot made<br>  At court, their bills had brought and, clam'ring, begg'd<br>  Their dues.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who from his window sees<br>  In early morning blue and cloudless skies,<br>  And o'er him feels the breezes blowing soft,<br>  While in his heart is peace, but later finds<br>  The breezes risen to a gale, and dull,<br>  Grey clouds fast shutting out the sun and sky<br>  And in his bosom discontent is lord;<br>  So was it with King Lot when from his chair,<br>  After the morning meal which Bellicent,<br>  His Queen, had with her maids prepar'd for him--<br>  Since well she knew what meats would please him best--<br>  He fain had had risen purpose-mov'd to pass<br>  Without, but, rising, heard a dismal noise<br>  And saw the door burst open while a throng<br>  Of angry debtors clos'd him round about.<br>  Shrill rang their voices 'mong the rafters high<br>  O'erhead, and scarce the King could headway make<br>  Against their loud-voic'd clamor, but at length,<br>  When they had tir'd themselves with shriekings shrill,<br>  He spake again and all attent they heard.<br>  <br>  "Peace, fools, and leave me time to overlook<br>  Your bills.  This done, to-morrow at this hour<br>  The seneschal shall see that all are paid."<br>  <br>  This said, he wav'd his hand, and at the sign<br>  The rout of debtors vanish'd all at once<br>  And swift, as oftentimes a chatt'ring flock<br>  Of sparrows disappears before the sound<br>  Of nearing feet, so quickly drew they off,<br>  Each man communing with himself, the while<br>  Their sharp heels clatter'd on the flinty floor.<br>  <br>  Then like a wrathful sunshine smil'd King Lot.<br>  "I go not to the chase to-day, it seems,<br>  But weary hours must spend instead, forsooth,<br>  In balancing accounts, since in my court<br>  Of figures none knows aught, save I, the King."<br>  <br>  At this the sullen Modred, eldest son<br>  Of Lot, laught softly to himself,--right glad<br>  That any business kept the kingly eye<br>  From him, for full of tricks and craft was he,<br>  The Artful Dodger of an early day,<br>  And often in an uproar set the court.<br>  <br>  And now the knights and squires had gone without<br>  Their King, while he, with anxious face and brow<br>  All frown, sat 'mongst his money caskets lost<br>  In calculations deep, and murm'ring low<br>  Of pounds and shillings, and, at times, of pence,<br>  And oft, for better aiming at results,<br>  His fingers counting as do boys at school--<br>  Like them perplext for want of fingers more--<br>  So past his morning hours away.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile<br>  Had Bellicent, the Queen, her husband left,<br>  And to the kitchen gone to oversee<br>  The maids, for such her careful custom was.<br>  Right bitter was her tongue when these transgress'd,<br>  But to obedience was she all as sweet<br>  As winds from off a perfum'd bank of flowers,--<br>  And this her maidens knew and strove to please.<br>  But on her brow this morn there lurkt a frown,<br>  And in her heart reign'd vague unrest, and why<br>  She knew not, yet she held her peace and came<br>  And went on household quests and would have still'd<br>  The gnawing hunger at her heart, and all<br>  In vain.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last she to a cupboard bent<br>  Her steps, an oaken cupboard built within<br>  A niche, and wisely for such purpose made,<br>  And open threw its doors.  On oaken shelf<br>  There gleam'd the glass and silver kept for days<br>  Of pomp and show, for Bellicent, the Queen,<br>  Had joy in burnisht silver as became<br>  Her state, and on her treasure gaz'd she now<br>  With proper pride, but on the topmost shelf<br>  Her eyes, blue as the seas that circle round<br>  Her island realm and dash against its crags,<br>  Espied a wheaten loaf, and, close beside,<br>  A jar of amber honey, of some hive<br>  The luscious spoil.  Beholding these the frown<br>  From off her brow departed, and, therewith,<br>  The gnawing at her heart, and putting forth<br>  A slender arm to which a broider'd sleeve,<br>  All of red samite, clung in shapely fold,<br>  She graspt the jar of amber sweets and next<br>  The wheaten loaf, and, all rejoicing, bore<br>  Them to a corner window-lit by niche<br>  Deep sunk and narrow as the zone that bound<br>  Her robe of scarlet samite at the waist,<br>  A curtain loosely drawn before kept off<br>  Intrusive eyes, and here the Queen retir'd.<br>  Upon a ledge beneath the window lay<br>  A sharpen'd knife with silvern hilt whereon<br>  The cunning artisan had made the dog<br>  To chase the boar, and, seizing this, the Queen<br>  From off the loaf broad slices cut in haste,<br>  And o'er them pour'd the honey from the jar<br>  With murmurs of delight half-heard from lips<br>  That now in ecstasy essay'd to taste.<br>  Then o'er her senses past a drowsy calm<br>  As, slowly eating there alone, she grew<br>  Forgetful wholly of her lord the King,<br>  Forgetful of the honey on her gown,<br>  Forgetful of the dinner to be cook'd,<br>  Forgetful of the swift-approaching noon,<br>  Forgetful of her kitchen and its cares.<br>  And this forgetfulness was pleasant to her.<br>  <br>  Behind the palace, in a courtyard small,<br>  Hemm'd in by walls to which the lichen clung<br>  In stains of gold and silver laced with black,<br>  The moon-faced Edith paced with hasty tread,<br>  Bearing the basket with the Monday's wash,<br>  Bare to the elbow were her sturdy arms,<br>  On which, all red with labor, shone the suds.<br>  Low overhead an hempen network fine<br>  In intricate confusion mingl'd, cross<br>  And bar.  Thereon the damsel deftly flung<br>  The many motley garments of the court,<br>  Diverse of shape and in strange order set,<br>  Since here the mended hose of poorest squire<br>  Hung neighbor to the night-rail of the King.<br>  Glad was the maid to think her work was done,<br>  And all her youth broke forth in gladsome song--<br>  The song itself a thing of little wit<br>  But humble and accordant with her toil--<br>  <br>  "Rub, rub, and scrub! the soap is on the shelf!<br>  There's many a one much wiser than myself;<br>  But not an old man counting o'er his pelf.<br>  "Rub, rub, and scrub! the soap is here by me!<br>  And soap is such to me if not to thee;<br>  And whether soap or soda let it be.<br>  <br>  "Rub, scrub and rub! and the slack clothes-line blows:<br>  Scrub, rub and scrub, and where is she? who knows?<br>  From one wash to another wash she goes."<br>  <br>  Loud sang the maid, and all the while behind<br>  An angle in the courtyard Modred sat<br>  Sullen, and crouch'd with mischief in his heart.<br>  Beside him glossy-wing'd, and sharp of beak,<br>  A blackbird skulk'd, with evil eye upturn'd<br>  To meet the evil eye of Modred bent<br>  On him, and one were these in purpose ill.<br>  Scarce could the knavish Modred bide the time<br>  When he the moon-faced, unsuspicious maid<br>  Might harm, and oft the blackbird pertly peer'd<br>  Into his face, as one that sayeth "Here<br>  Am I," again, and "Master, is it time?"<br>  At last it chanced that as the damsel mov'd<br>  Among the garments that o'erhung the space,<br>  And glisten'd in the sun, she turn'd her head<br>  A moment toward the angle in the wall<br>  All unregardful of the danger there.<br>  Full roseate were her cheeks, but redder still<br>  Her nose, wherefore, I know not, I but tell<br>  The tale, and this, when wicked Modred saw,<br>  He aim'd a villain's finger toward, whereat<br>  The bird, upstarting, flew with direful speed,<br>  And, ere the maid could frame a thought of ill,<br>  Had nipt the crimson'd feature with his beak.<br>  Sore was the hurt and loud the damsel shriek'd,<br>  And wildly from the courtyard ran in haste<br>  And pain, but ere she many steps had gone<br>  A cord that Modred o'er the path had stretch'd,<br>  Catching her feet low fell'd her to the ground.<br>  All heavily she sank to earth and lay<br>  As one whom fright and pain have overcome<br>  At once and stol'n away the strength to move.<br>  <br>  This saw the Prince, the while he prais'd the bird<br>  For faithful service done, and then the twain<br>  Departed by a secret way that none<br>  But Modred knew.  Within the damsel's breast,<br>  Whenas she rose and gain'd her feet<br>  And naught of bird or other creature saw,<br>  Both rage and grief held riot bitter there,<br>  But in the heart of Modred joy was lord.<br>  <br>
