## THE WATER CARRIERS

### by

## OSCAR FAY ADAMS

*ARGUMENT.  
  
Jack and Gill went up the hill  
      To draw a pail of water.  
Jack fell down and broke his crown  
      And Gill came tumbling after.*  
  
  
"So all day long the noise of battle roll'd  
Among the mountains by the winter sea,"  
But young Lavaine, the knight of Astolat,  
And brother to the lily maid who died  
For Lancelot's love, was reckon'd not of those  
Who "fell in Lyonnesse about their Lord,"  
King Arthur, whom the three Queens bore away.  
For he, Lavaine, who lov'd Sir Lancelot  
But reverenced his King and conscience more,  
Had hasten'd to the standard of his King  
When evil-hearted Modred rais'd revolt,  
And Lancelot, the faithless, stain'd, alas!  
His manhood, warring 'gainst his friend and King.  
And so, because the lad was true and brave,  
And modest seeming, nor was rash of speech,  
Had Arthur made him of the Table Round  
And lov'd to have him near. Whereat Lavaine  
Greatly rejoic'd and gladly would have died  
To serve in any wise the blameless King.  
But when the sun came from the under world  
And shone upon that field of battle near  
The winter sea, Lavaine by Arthur's side  
Receiv'd a vengeful thrust aim'd at the King,  
And from his horse, slow reeling, fell, and o'er  
Him swept the host; but bluff Sir Torre, who saw  
His brother fall, came spurring hence and dragg'd  
Him to one side, and there, in knightly wise,  
Gave him such tendance as his wit devis'd,  
And left him, guarded by a humble squire,  
But thinking, "If I live, I will return;"  
And scarce an hour was gone before a stroke  
From one of Modred's men had cleft Sir Torre  
From brain to nape. So died he for his Lord.  
  
But of his tendance or his death Lavaine  
Knew naught, but lay in stupor deep as death,  
And to the eye that watch'd he seem'd as dead.  
Whereat the humble squire mus'd to himself:  
  
"If he be dead, he needs not me to guard;  
And if he be alive his foes will think  
Him dead, and truly I do deem him dead,  
Yet be he dead or living I must see  
The issue of the fight," and saying went  
And saw, and, seeing, met the death which might  
Have spar'd him by the side of Sir Lavaine.  
  
"So all day long the noise of battle roll'd,"  
Yet Sir Lavaine in stupor lay upon  
The field until the sun went down, and shone  
The moon at full upon his armor clasps  
And glinted on the chasing of his sword.  
As one who journeying in lands remote  
Returning takes by slow degrees the old  
Life up, so Sir Lavaine return'd from death  
Or what had seem'd like death, not all at once  
But dimly had a knowledge of his state  
And what had past, and then, because too weak  
To think, he fell in sleep again and wak'd  
Not till the sun brake from the underworld,  
And near him, having watch'd the barge that bore  
King Arthur out of sight, there slowly drew  
The bold Sir Bedivere. These two last left  
Alive upon the field.  
  
                                       The mournful twain  
At length slow moving from the field, because  
Lavaine was weak from hunger and the wound,  
Past on to where within a little wood  
A simple hermit liv'd a blameless life.  
With him the pair abode until Lavaine  
Was heal'd and then the bold Sir Bedivere  
Past to his own land, distant Cameliard,  
And then, a little later, past Lavaine  
To his.  
  
                     Small joy was now at Astolat  
For him, the last of all his race, and night  
And day he seem'd to hear the lily maid  
Singing her swan song from the eastern tow'r,  
Or bluff Sir Torre stride thro' the broken halls,  
Or else his father, dead a year agone,  
Calling him tenderly as was his wont,  
And so by always listening to the dead  
He ceased to hearken to the living voice,  
And more and more withdrew into himself.  
  
But when the next approaching spring had fail'd  
To stir the languid blood within his veins,  
The dumb old servitor before him stood  
One April morning in the castle yard  
And pointed to the south, and then by signs  
Essay'd to free his mind, and Sir Lavaine,  
Half comprehending, asked him, "Shall I go  
Thither?" Thereat the dumb old man nodded,  
His finger once more pointing to the south.  
So, deeming that his humble servitor  
Had deeper knowledge of the best, Lavaine,  
A little later gathering the few  
Who serv'd for love, not hire, within the halls  
Of Astolat, past with them into lands  
Of Cornish name, and made a home for them  
And for himself; and, marrying a maid  
Of Cornish race, saw children of his own  
And all the past became a memory.  
  
Before his home in Cornwall lay the sea,  
And a thick wood behind it northward stretch'd  
But to the left a dusty white road climb'd  
A hill on which there frown'd a single tow'r,  
And on the farther side a hamlet slept  
In peace and plenty, owning him for lord.  
There o'er his Cornish castle past the years  
From churlish winter into spring until  
Ten times the ash buds blackened with the winds  
Of March since blameless Arthur past beyond  
The mournful gaze of bold Sir Bedivere.  
  
A younger copy of himself, or like  
Himself when but eight tender seasons old,  
Now listen'd, wonder-ey'd, to Sir Lavaine  
When he would talk of arms and of the last  
Great day in Lyonnesse. Jack had the lad  
Been call'd for some past claimant for the hand  
Of her Lavaine call'd wife, yet this Lavaine  
Knew not, but deem'd the unfamiliar name  
A careless fancy of his Cornish wife's,  
Whose lightest fancy 'twas his care to please.  
Slender the lad, as once his father was,  
But all the blood of lusty Astolat  
Made summer in his veins. Seldom apart  
From him his sister Gillian was, and each  
Without the other droopt and pin'd. Most like  
Her aunt, the dead Elaine, young Gillian seem'd,  
And oft the father, looking at her, felt  
Remembrance of the distant past confuse  
The present, till if he were boy or man  
And this his child or playmate sister seem'd  
Sometimes a thing of doubt.  
  
                                The two, the maid  
And Jack, lov'd better than all else to climb  
The long white road, that steep and stony, led  
Up to the single, broken, frowning tow'r.  
Four trees beside the tow'r bent o'er a spring  
That broke from out a sombre, rocky cleft.  
Here Tristram once had drunk with fair Iseult,  
Mark's wife, and laught to see the shining drops  
Slip thro' her fingers, when she held her hand  
Cupwise, that he might drink therefrom. And here  
Had sweet Sir Percivale once stopt to drink,  
Returning from the Quest of Holy Grail;  
Here, too, had Pelleas, the bright boy knight,  
A brief hour linger'd, flying from the court  
In that dark time when all his early faith  
In woman's virtue died, and good Sir Bors,  
The false Gawain, the pure Sir Galahad,  
And many more of that great Table Round  
Had drunk from these sweet waters to their gain.  
Full oft had Gillian and the stripling Jack  
Bent o'er the spring as bent the trees above,  
And laught to see two faces gazing up,  
One fair and pale, the other fair and red.  
Maid Gillian's was the one, the other his.  
  
Now as it hapt, Lavaine in that tenth year  
Fell ill of some dull fever in the blood,  
And twenty mornings past and still the knight  
Felt the slow poison creeping thro' his veins  
And grew at last indifferent to the end.  
To him maid Gillian pityingly came  
And said with tears:  
            "Sure am I that one thing  
Would cure this deadly fever."  
  
            Then Lavaine:  
"Yea, dost thou think it, little maid? then let  
Me hear."  
            Then she:  
            "A draught of water brought  
From spring beside the tow'r would cure, so pure  
It is and sweet, and Jack and I would bring  
It gladly an' 'twould please you drink, my lord."  
To whom the sick man answer'd wearily,  
Yet thinking she by chance had spoken truth  
As he bethought him of the water's fame:  
"Child, since you wish it, bring, and I will drink."  
  
Thereat and lightly sprang the maiden down  
The steps that led to outer air, and close  
Beside came Jack, a silver vessel swung  
From one small hand, and so the childish twain  
Went up the hill and quickly reach'd its top.  
Then Jack, with Gill beside, stoopt low and fill'd  
The vessel till the drops did chase themselves  
All down its burnisht sides. This done, they left  
The spring, and holding each the vessel's rim,  
Return'd as they had come, but slower, lest  
By haste the precious draught were spilt and lost.  
Then as in distance smaller grew the tow'r  
Behind, the maid broke out in tender song:  
  
"Sweet is the sunshine coming after rain;  
And sweet this water unto lips in pain:  
Which is the sweeter? that in truth know I.  
  
"Light, art thou sweet? then sweeter waters be:  
Light, thou art grateful; sweet this draught to me.  
O light, if death be near him, let me die.  
  
"Sweet light that fades at eve too soon away,  
Sweet waters springing from the dark to day,  
Which is the sweeter? that in truth know I.  
  
"Pain, follow night, and henceforth from him flee;  
Thou needs must follow night that waits for thee;  
But, if thou wilt not, then O let me die."  
  
Clear with the last line rang her voice, and Jack,  
Who heeded not his ways when Gillian sang,  
Slipt, as the last note ceas'd, upon a piece  
Of sliding stone, and slipping, fell, dragging  
The singer down, and both together roll'd,  
All in a horror of loose stones and dust  
And flying limbs and broken bones and crowns,  
Far down the steep side of that rocky hill.  
So perish'd these two of the fated house  
Of Astolat; and in the night that follow'd,  
And near a dawning fierce with wind and rain,  
Wherein the sea wag'd battle with the sky  
And both with earth, to final judgment past  
Lavaine.
