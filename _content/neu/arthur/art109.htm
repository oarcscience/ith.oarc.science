B. MONEY-COUTTS</h2>  </center>  <br>  <br> 		I<br> King Mark came riding, in great despite,<br>    Seeking Sir Tristram to slay,<br> And chanced on a merry and courteous knight, <br> But knew him not for that jesting wight<br>    Sir Dinadan, brave and gay.<br> <br> 		II<br> As saddle to saddle they paced along,<br>    Hoving afar they saw<br> Horses and knights in a gallant throng<br>    Under the forest shaw.<br> <br> 		III<br> Said Dinadan, "Lo! by yon cloth of gold<br>    Launcelot rides this way!"<br> And Mark, like a man that shakes with cold,<br> Said, "Launcelot here?  Then I cannot hold<br>    Longer with you today!"<br> <br> 		IV<br> When Dinadan spied he might scarce abide<br>    For terror,  he cried, "I see<br> Sir Launcelot's shield!  On a silver field<br>    Three lions and lilies three!"<br> <br> 		V<br> But he said it to shape a jest and jape,<br>    That cowardly King to school;<br> For lions and lilies emblazoned thrice<br> He wist full well were the new device <br>    Of Dagonet, Arthur's fool.<br> <br> 		VI<br> Now Mark had turned him about, to slip<br>    Back, like a snake, for fear;<br> But Dinadan rode to his fellowship,<br>    Who made of him passing cheer.<br> <br> 		VII<br> He told them his craft and all agreed;<br>    So Dagonet, armed to fight,<br> Adventured his spear and spurred at speed,<br> Crying, "Ho! ye caitiff of Cornish breed !<br>    Keep ye, ye craven knight!"<br> <br> 		VIII<br> Now out, now in, through thick and through thin,<br>    Mark fled from that shield aghast;<br> Through thick and through thin, with dindle and din,<br>    Sir Dagonet followed fast!<br> <br> 		IX<br> Then the knights chased after, with Ho! and Yield!<br>    And he ran like a rated hound;<br> And the cry rose high and the laughter pealed,<br> Till wood and water and forest and field<br>    Rang with the noise and sound.<br>
