I had dried my tears. I had said, "Ah, why should I weep?" <br>  <br>  I will not be fooled by her, by the spell of her fair child's face. <br>  What is its meaning to me, who have seen, who have known, who have loved what  miracle forms of grace? <br>  What are its innocent wiles, its smiles, its idle sweet girlishness? <br>  <br>  I will not love without love. I despise the ways of a fool. <br>  Let me prevail as of old, as lover, as lord, as king, or have done with Love's tyrant rule. <br>  I was born to command, not serve, not obey. No boy am I in Love's school. <br>  <br>  I have fled to the fields, the plains, the desert places of rest, <br>  To the forest's infinite smile, where the cushat calls from the trees and the yaffle has  lined her nest, <br>  To the purple hills with the spray of the sea, when the wind blows loud from the west. <br>  <br>  I have done with her love and her, the wine-draughts of human pleasure. <br>  The voice of nature is best, the cradle song of the trees which is hymned to Time's  stateliest measure, <br>  As once a boy in the woods I heard it and held it an exquisite treasure. <br>  <br>  I had clean forgotten all. I had sung to the indolent hills<br>  Songs of joy without grief, since grief is of human things the shadow of human ills. <br>  I sang aloud in my pride of song to the chime of the answering rills. <br>  <br>  And, behold, the whole world heard, the dull mad man-ridden Earth. <br>  And they cried, "A prophet hath risen, a sage with the heart of a child, a bard of no  human birth, <br>  A soul that hath known nor pain, nor sin, a singer of infinite mirth." <br>  <br>  And she too heard it and came. And she knew it was I grown wise. <br>  And she stood from the rest apart, and I watched her with pitying scorn, and then with a  sad surprise, <br>  And last with a new sweet passionate joy, for I saw there were tears in her eyes. <br>  <br>  And she came and sat at my feet, as in days ere our grief began. <br>  And I saw her a woman grown. And I was a prophet no more, but a desolate voiceless  man. <br>  And I clasped her fast in my arms in joy and kissed her tears as they ran. <br>  <br>  And I shall not be fooled by her, though her face is fair as a rose. <br>  And I shall not live without love, though the world should forget my songs and I should  forget its woes,<br>  And the purple hills should forget the sea and the spray when the west wind blows. <br>  <br>
