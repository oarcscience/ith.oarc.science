In tranquil ease<br> The warriors grouped themselves by twos and threes<br> About the dames and damsels of the court,<br> And chattered careless words of small import;<br> But in an alcove, unobserved, apart,<br> Young Gawayne sat with Lady Elfinhart.<br> In Arthur's court no goodlier knight than he<br> Wore shirt of mail, or Cupid's panoply;<br> And Elfinhart, to Gawayne's eager eyes,<br> Of all heaven's treasures seemed the goodliest prize.<br> Now daylight faded, and the twilight gloom<br> Deepened the stillness in the vaulted room,<br> Save where upon the hearth a fitful glow<br> Blushed from the embers as the fire burned low.<br> There is a certain subtle twilight mood,<br> When two hearts meet in a dim solitude,<br> That thrills the soul e'en to the finger-tips,<br> And brings the heart's dear secrets to the lips.<br> In Gawayne's corner, as the shades grew thicker,<br> Four eyes waxed brighter, and two pulses quicker;<br> Ten minutes more of quiet talk unbroken,<br> And heaven alone can tell what might be spoken!<br> But it was not to be, for fates unequal<br> Compelled--but this anticipates the sequel.<br> Just in the nick of time, King Arthur rose<br> From his sedate post-prandial repose,<br> And called for lights.  Along the shadowy aisles<br> His pages' footsteps pattered o'er the tiles,<br> Speeding to do his errand, and at once<br> Four tapers flickered from each silver sconce.<br> The scene was changed, the dreamer's dream dispelled,<br> And what might else have been his fate withheld<br> From Gawayne's grasp.  So may one touch of chance<br> Shatter the fragile fabric of romance,<br> And all the heart's desire,--the joy, the trouble,--<br> Flash to oblivion with the bursting bubble!<br> <br> But Arthur on his kingly dais-seat,<br> Felt nothing of the passion and the heat<br> That fire young blood.  He raised his warlike head<br> And glancing moodily around him, said:<br> "So have ye feasted well, my knights, this day,<br> And filled your hearts with revel and with play.<br> But to my mind that day is basely spent<br> Which passes by without accomplishment<br> Of some bright deed of arms or chivalry.<br> We rust in indolence.  As well not be,<br> As be the minions of an idle court<br> Where all is gallantry and girlish sport!<br> Some bold adventure let our thoughts devise,<br> To stir our courage and to cheer our eyes."<br> And lo! while yet he spoke, from far away<br> In the thick shroud of the departed day,<br> Upon the frosty air of evening borne,<br> Came the faint challenge of a fairy horn!<br> <br> King Arthur started up in mild surprise,<br> While knights and dames looked round with questioning eyes,<br> And each to other spoke some hurried word,<br> As, "Did you hear it?"--"What was that I heard?"<br> But well they knew; for you must understand<br> That Camelot lay close to Fairyland,<br> And the wild blast of fairy horns, once known,<br> Is straightway recognized as soon as blown,<br> Being a sound unique, unearthly, shrill,--<br> Between a screech-owl and a whip-poor-will.<br> The mischief is, that no one e'er can tell<br> Whether such heralding bodes ill or well!<br> <br> The ladies of the palace looked faint fear,<br> Dreading some perilous adventure near;<br> For peril can the bravest spirits move,<br> When threatening not ourselves, but those we love;<br> But Lady Elfinhart clapped hands in glee,--<br> In sooth, no sentimentalist seemed she,--<br> And cried: "Now, brave Sir Gawayne,--O what fun!<br> Succor us, save us, else we are undone;<br> Show us the prowess of your arm this night;<br> I never saw a tilt by candle-light!"<br> Gaily she spoke, and seemed all unconcerned;<br> And yet a curious watcher might have learned<br> From a slight quaver in her laughter free<br> To doubt the frankness of her flippancy.<br> Gawayne, bewildered, looked the other way,<br> And wondered what she meant; for in that day<br> The ready wit of man was under muzzle,<br> And woman's heart was still an unsolved puzzle;<br> And Gawayne, though in valor next to none,<br> Wished that <i> her</i>  heart had been a tenderer one.<br> His sword was out for any foe on earth,<br> And yet to face death for a lady's mirth<br> Seemed scarce worth while.  What honor bade, he'ld do,<br> But would have liked to see a tear or two.<br> <br> While thus he pondered, came a sudden burst<br> Of high-pitched fairy horn-calls, like the first,<br> But nearer, clearer, deadlier than before,<br> Blown seemingly from just outside the door.<br> The casements shook, the taper lights all trembled;<br> The bravest knight's dismay was ill-dissembled;<br> And as all sprang with one accord to win<br> Their swords and shields, stern combat to begin,<br> The great doors shot their bolts, and opened slowly in.<br> And now my laboring muse is hard beset,<br> For something followed such as never yet<br> Was writ or sung, by human voice or hand,<br> Save those that tell old tales from Fairyland.<br> "Miracles <i> do</i>  not happen:"--'t is plain sense,<br> If you italicize the present tense;<br> But in those days, as rare old Chaucer tells,<br> All Britain was fulfilled of miracles.<br> So, as I said, the great doors opened wide.<br> In rushed a blast of winter from outside,<br> And with it, galloping on the empty air,<br> A great green giant on a great green mare<br> Plunged like a tempest-cleaving thunderbolt,<br> And struck four-footed, with an earthquake's jolt,<br> Plump on the hearthstone.  There the uncouth wight<br> Sat greenly laughing at the strange affright<br> That paled all cheeks and opened wide all eyes;<br> Till after the first shock of quick surprise<br> The people circled round him, still in awe,<br> And circling stared; and this is what they saw:<br> Cassock and hood and hose, of plushy sheen<br> Like close-cut grass upon a bowling-green,<br> Covered his stature, from his verdant toes<br> To the green brows that topped his emerald nose.<br> His beard was glossy, like unripened corn;<br> His eyes shot sparklets like the polar morn,<br> But like in hue unto that deep-sea green<br> Wherewith must shine those gems of ray serene<br> The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear.<br> Green was his raiment, green his monstrous mare.<br> He rode unarmed, uncorsleted, unshielded,<br> Except that in his huge right hand he wielded<br> A frightful battle-axe, with blade as green<br> As coppery rust;--but the long edge shone keen.<br> <br> Such was the stranger, and he turned his head<br> From one side to the other, and then said,<br> With gentle voice, most like a summer breeze<br> That rustles through the leaves of the grren trees:<br> "So this is Arthur's court!  My noble lord,<br> You said just now you felt a trifle bored,<br> And wished, instead of dancing, feasting, flirting,<br> Your gallant warriors might be exerting<br> Their puissance upon some worthier thing.<br> The wish, my lord, was worthy of a king!<br> It pleased me; here I am; and I intend<br> To serve your fancy as a faithful friend.<br> I bring adventure,--no hard, tedious quest,<br> But merely what I call a merry jest.<br> Let some good knight, the doughtiest of you all,<br> Swing this my battle-axe, and let it fall<br> On whatsoever part of me he will;<br> I will abide the blow, and hold me still;<br> But let him, just a twelvemonth from this day,<br> Come to me, if by any means he may,<br> And let me, if I live, pay back my best,<br> As he pays me.  What think you of the jest?"<br> He said; and made a courteous bow,--the while<br> Lighting his features with a bright green smile;<br> As when June breezes, after rain-clouds pass,<br> Ripple in sunlight o'er the unmown grass.<br> <br> The jest seemed fair indeed; but none the less<br> No knight showed any undue forwardness<br> To seize the offer.  Some with laughter free<br> Daffed it aside; while others carelessly<br> Strolled to the farthest corners of the hall<br> As if they had not heard his words at all,<br> And whistled with an air of idle ease,<br> Or studied figures in the tapestries.<br> Not so Sir Gawayne.  Vexed in mind he stood<br> With downcast eyes, and knew not what he would.<br> Trained in the school of chivalry to prize<br> His honor as the light of his dear eyes,<br> He held his life, his fortunes, everything,<br> In sacred trust for knighthood and his king,<br> And in the battle-field or tilting-yard<br> He met his foe full-fronted, and struck hard.<br> But now it seemed a foolish thing to throw<br> One's whole life to the fortune of a blow.<br> True valor breathes not in the braggart vaunt;<br> True honor takes no shame from idle taunt;<br> So let this wizard, if he wants to, scoff;<br> Why should our hero have his head cut off?<br> <br> While thus Sir Gawayne, wrapped in thought intense,<br> Debated honor versus common sense,<br> The stranger knight was casting his green glance<br> Around the circling throng,--until by chance<br> He met the eyes of Lady Elfinhart,<br> And--did she flush?--and did the Green Knight start?<br> Surely a quiver twinkled in each eye;<br> But what of that?  It need not signify:<br> Beneath his glance a brave man well might flush;<br> What wonder then that a fair maid should blush?<br> And as for him, no man that ever loved<br> Could look upon her loveliness unmoved.<br> Could I but picture her--ah, you would deem<br> My tale the figment of a poet's dream;<br> And if you saw her, (could such bliss be given),<br> You'ld think <i> yourself</i>  in dreamland--or in heaven,<br> Not the red rapture of new-wakened roses,<br> When morning dew their soul of love uncloses,<br> (Roses that must be wooed,--nor may be won<br> Save by the prince of lovers, the warm sun),<br> Not the fair lily, nor the violet shy,<br> Whose heart's love lurks deep in her still blue eye,<br> Nor any flower, the loveliest and the best,<br> Can image to you half the charm compressed<br> In those dear eyes, those lips,--nay, every part<br> That made that sum of witcheries--Elfinhart.<br> <br> Her face was a dim dream of shadowy light,<br> Like misty moonbeams on the fields of night,<br> And in her voice sweet nature's sweetest tunes<br> Sang the glad song of twenty cloudless Junes.<br> Her raiment,--nay; go, reader, if you please,<br> To some sage Treatise on Antiquities,<br> Whence writers of historical romances<br> Cull old embroideries for their new-spun fancies;<br> I care not for the trivial, nor the fleeting.<br> Beneath her dress a woman's heart was beating<br> The rhythm of love's eternal eloquence,<br> And I confess to you, in confidence,<br> Though flowers have grown a thousand years above her,<br> Unseen, unknown, with all my soul I love her.<br> <br> From these digressions upon love and glory,<br> 'T is time we were returning to our story.<br> I only meant, in a few words, to tell you<br> (For fear my heroine's conduct should repel you)<br> That if she jests, for instance, out of season,<br> Perhaps there is a good substantial reason.<br> Sir Gawayne, had he seen the stranger wink<br> And seen the lady blushing, you may think<br> Might have been spared a most unhappy lot.<br> Perhaps you're right;--but peradventure not.<br> I give you the hint, for half the art<br> Of narrative is holding back a part,<br> And if without reserve I gave my best<br> In the first canto, who would read the rest?<br> <br> But now Sir Gawayne, with a troubled eye,<br> Looked up, and saw his lady standing by.<br> Quoth he: "And if this conjurer unblest<br> Win no acceptance of his bitter jest,<br> How then in after days shall Arthur's court<br> Confront the calumny and foul report<br> Of idle tongues?"  The wrath in Gawayne's eyes<br> Flashed for an instant; then in humbler wise<br> He spoke on: "Yet God grant I be not blind<br> Where honor lights the way; for to my mind<br> True honor bids us shun the devil's den,<br> To fight God's battles in the world of men.<br> Who takes this challenge up, I doubt will rue it."<br> Quoth Elfinhart: "I'ld like to see you do it!"<br> She laughed a gay laugh, but by hard constraint;<br> Then turned and hid her face, all pale and faint,<br> As one might be who stabs and turns the knife<br> In the warm heart of one more dear than life.<br> She turned and Gawayne saw not; but he heard,<br> And felt his heart-strings tighten at her word.<br> "Nay, lady, if you wish it I will try;<br> Be your least wish my will, although I die!<br> Yet one thing, if I may, I fain would ask,<br> Before I make the venture;--if this task<br> Prove fateful as it threatens,--do you care?"<br> "Perhaps," said Elfinhart, "you do not dare!"<br> Lightly she laughed, and scoffing tossed her head,<br> Yet spoke as one who knew not what she said,<br> With random words, and with quick-taken breath;<br> Then turned again, ere that same look of death<br> Should steal upon her and betray her heart<br> Despite all stratagems of woman's art.<br> And Gawayne heard but saw not; and the night<br> Descended on him, and his face grew white<br> With grief and passion.  When all else is lost,<br> The brave man gives life too, nor counts the cost.<br> "I dreamt," he murmured to himself, "and dreaming<br> I took for truth what was but sweetest seeming.<br> My waking eyes find naught in life to keep;<br> I take the venture, and so back--to sleep."<br> <br> By this, the stranger had at last become<br> Tired of long waiting, and of sitting dumb<br> Upon his charger; so with greenest leer<br> He vented his impatience in a sneer.<br> "Is this," he said, "the glorious Table Round,<br> And is its glory naught but empty sound?<br> Braggarts!  I put your bluster to the test,<br> And find you quail before a merry jest!"<br> Then the great king himself stood up in ire,<br> With clenched hand raised, and eyes that gleamed dark fire,<br> And fronting the Green Knight he cried: "Forbear!<br> For by my sword Excalibur I swear,<br> Whate'er thou be, thou shall not carry hence<br> Unscathed the memory of thine insolence.<br> Such jests as thine please not; yet even so<br> I take thine axe; kneel down, and take my blow."<br> <br> Across the Green Knight's features there was seen<br> To pass a fleeting shade of deeper green,<br> Whether of disappointment or resentment<br> None knew; but straight a smile of bright contentment<br> Followed, as through the throng of dazed beholders<br> He saw Sir Gawayne thrust his sturdy shoulders.<br> The stranger winked at Elfinhart once more,<br> Well pleased, and Gawayne knelt down on the floor.<br> "A boon," he cried, "a boon, my lord and king!<br> If ever yet in any little thing<br> These hands have served thee, hear my last request:<br> Let <i> me</i>  adventure this mad monster's jest!"<br> King Arthur shook his head in dumb denial,<br> Loth to withdraw his own hand from the trial,<br> And leave the vengeance that himself had vowed;<br> But all the people called to him aloud,<br> "Sir Gawayne!  let Sir Gawayne strike the blow!"<br> And Guinevere, the queen, besought him low<br> To leave this venture to the lesser man.<br> He yielded, and the merry jest began.<br> <br> The visitor, dismounting, made a bow<br> To Arthur, then to all the court.  "And now,"<br> Said he to Gawayne, "wheresoe'er you choose<br> To strike your blow, strike on; I'll not refuse;<br> Head, shoulders, chest, or waist, I little reck;<br> Where shall it be?"  Quoth Gawayne, "In the neck!"<br> <br> So Gawayne took the axe.  The stranger knelt<br> Before him on the hearth and loosed his belt,<br> And threw back his green cassock and his hood,<br> To give his foe the fairest mark he could.<br> Then thus to Gawayne: "Ready!  But remember<br> To come the twenty-fifth of next December,<br> And take from me the self-same stroke again!"<br> "And where," asked Gawayne, "may I find you then?"<br> "We'll speak of that, please, when you've struck your blow;<br> For if I can't speak, then you need not go!"<br> He chuckled softly to himself; then turned<br> And waited for the blow, all unconcerned.<br> Not so the knights and ladies of the court;<br> They pushed and craned their necks to see the sport;<br> Not from the lust of blood, for few expected<br> To see blood shed, or the Green Knight dissected,<br> But knowing that some marvel was in store<br> Unparalleled in all Arthurian lore,<br> And fairly filled with wide-eyed wonderment.<br> But Lady Elfinhart stayed not.  She went<br> Into the alcove where we saw her first<br> And laid her sweet face in her arms, and burst<br> Into--but none could tell, unless by peeping,<br> Whether she shook with laughter or with weeping.<br> <br> And Gawayne rubbed his arms, his chest he beat,<br> Then grasped the battle-axe and braced his feet,<br> And swung the ponderous weapon high in air,<br> And brought it down like lightening, fair and square<br> Upon the stranger's neck.  The axe flashed through,<br> Cutting the Green Knight cleanly right in two,<br> And split the hard stone floor like kindling wood.<br> The head dropped off; out gushed the thick, hot blood<br> Like--I can't find the simile I want,<br> But let us say a flood of <i> cr&ecirc;me de menthe</i> !<br> And then the warriors standing round about<br> Sent up from fifty throats a mighty shout,<br> As when o'er blood-sprent fields the long cheers roll<br> Cacophonous, for him who kicks a goal.<br> "O Gawayne!  Well done, Gawayne!" they all cried;<br> But straight the tumult and the shouting died,<br> And deadly pallor overspread each face,<br> For the knight's body stood up in its place<br> And stepping nimbly forward seized the head<br> That lay still on the hearth-stone, seeming dead;<br> Then vaulted lightly, with a careless air,<br> Back to the saddle of his grass-green mare.<br> He held the head up, and behold!  it spoke.<br> "My best congratulations on that stroke,<br> Sir Gawayne; it was delicately done!<br> Our merry little jest is well begun,<br> But look you fail me not this day next year!<br> At the Green Chapel by the Murmuring Mere<br> I will await you when the sun sinks low,<br> And pay you back full measure, blow for blow!"<br> He wheeled about, the doors flew wide once more,<br> The mare's hoofs struck green sparkles from the floor,<br> And with a whirring flash of emerald light<br> Both horse and rider vanished in the night.<br> <br> Then all the lords and ladies rubbed their eyes<br> And slowly roused themselves from dumb surprise.<br> The great hall echoed once more with the clatter<br> Of laughing men's and frightened women's chatter;<br> But Gawayne, with the axe in hand, stood still,<br> Heedless of what was passing, with no will<br> For life or death, for all that made life dear<br> Was fled like summer when the leaves fall sere.<br> And Arthur spoke, misreading Gawayne's thought:<br> "Heaven send we have not all too dearly bought<br> Our evening's pastime, Gawayne.  You have done<br> As fits a fearless knight, and nobly won<br> Our thanks in equal measure with our praise.<br> Be both remembered in the after days!"<br> <br> So spoke the king, and, to confirm his word,<br> From far away in the deep night was heard<br> Once more the fairy horn-call, clear and shrill;<br> It died upon the wind, and all was still.<br> The hour was late.  King Arthur, rising, said<br> Good-night to all the court, and went to bed.<br> <br> 	     CANTO II.<br> 	    ELFINHART.<br> <br> In Canto I. I followed the old rule<br> We learned from Horace when we went to school,<br> And took a headlong plunge <i> in medias res</i> ,<br> As Maro did, and blind M&aelig;onides;<br> And now, still following in the ancient mode,<br> I come to the time-honored "episode,"<br> Retrace my way some twenty years or more,<br> And tell you what I should have told before.<br> It seems an awkward method, but it's art;--<br> Besides, it brings us back to Elfinhart.<br> In those dark days before King Arthur came,<br> When Britain was laid waste with sword and flame,<br> When cut-throats lurked behind the blossoming thorn,<br> And young maids cursed the day when they were born,<br> A lady, widowed in one hideous night,<br> Fled over hearth and hill, and in her flight<br> Came to the magic willow-woods that stand<br> Beside the Murmuring Mere, in Fairyland;<br> And there, untimely, by the forest-side,<br> Clasping her infant in her arms, she died.<br> Yet not all friendless,--for such mortal throes<br> Pass not unpitied, though no mortal knows;--<br> The spirits that infest the clearer air<br> Looked down upon the innocent lady there,<br> While troops of fairies smoothed her mossy bed<br> And with sweet balsam pillowed her fair head.<br> Her dim eyes could not see them, but she guessed<br> Whose gentle ministrations thus had blessed<br> Her travail; and when pitying fairies laid<br> Upon her heart the child,--a blue-eyed maid,--<br> Ere yet her troubled spirit might depart,<br> With one last word she named her "Elfinhart."<br> <br> So with new-quickened love the fairy elves<br> Took the forlorn child-maiden to themselves<br> And reared her in the wildwood, where no jar<br> Of alien discord, echoing from afar,<br> Broke the sweet forest murmur, long years round.<br> Her ears, attuned to every woodland sound,<br> Translated to her soul the great world's voice,<br> And the world-spirit made her heart rejoice.<br> And love was hers,--perennial, intense,--<br> The love that wells from joy and innocence<br> And sanctifies the cloistered heart of youth,--<br> The love of love, of beauty, and of truth.<br> <br> So Elfinhart grew up.  Each passing year<br> Of forest life beside the Murmuring Mere<br> Enriched tenfold the natural dower of grace<br> That shone from the pure spirit in her face.<br> I cannot tell why each revolving season<br> Enhanced her beauty thus.  Some say the reason<br> Was in the stars; <i> I</i>  think those luminaries<br> Had less to do with it than had the fairies!<br> The more they found of grace in her, the more<br> Their silent influence added to her store;<br> For they were always with her; they and she<br> Still bore each other loving company.<br> And yet one further virtue,--not the least<br> Of those that make life lovable,--increased<br> In Elfinhart's sweet nature from her birth<br> By fairy tutelage; and that was mirth.<br> For fairy natures are compounded all<br> Of whimsies and of freaks fantastical,<br> And what the best of fairies loves the best<br> (Except pure kindness) is an artless jest.<br> And so wise men have argued, on the whole,<br> That the misguided creatures have no soul;<br> But as for me, if the bright fairy elf<br> Has none, I'll get along without, myself!<br> These fairies laughed and danced and sang sweet songs,<br> And did all else that to their craft belongs,--<br> All tricks and pranks of whole-souled jollity<br> That makes life merry 'neath the greenwood tree.<br> The youngest of them childishly beguiled<br> The time when Elfinhart was still a child;<br> They pinched her fingers, and they pulled her ears,<br> Or sometimes, when her blue eyes dreamed of tears,<br> Half smothered her with showers of four-leafed clover,--<br> Then fled for refuge to some sweet-fern cover;<br> But she pursued them through their tangled lair<br> And caught them, and put fire-flies in their hair;<br> And then they all joined hands, and round and round<br> They danced a morris on the moonlit ground.<br> <br> The years went by, and Elfinhart outgrew<br> The madcap antics of the younger crew,<br> (For fairies age but slowly: don't forget<br> That at two hundred they are children yet!)<br> But still she frolicked with them, though scarce <i> of</i>  them,<br> And learned each year more tenderly to love them.<br> But most of all she loved with all her heart<br> On quiet summer nights to walk apart<br> And hold close converse with the fairies' queen,--<br> A radiant maiden princess who had seen<br> Some twenty centuries of revolving suns<br> Pass over Fairyland,--all golden ones!<br> Sometimes they sat still in the mild moon's light,<br> Where chestnut blooms made sweet the breath of night,<br> And talked of the great world beyond the wood,--<br> Of death, or sin, or sorrow, understood<br> Of neither,--till the twinkling stars were gone,<br> And bustling Chanticleer proclaimed the dawn.<br> And Elfinhart grew wise in fairy learning;<br> But by degrees a half unconscious yearning<br> For humankind stirred in her gentle heart,<br> And woke a deep desire to bear her part<br> Of love and sorrow in the larger life<br> As sister, helper,--nay, perhaps as wife;--<br> For such vague instincts, after all, are human,<br> And Elfinhart herself was but a woman.<br> And yet, for all this new desire, I doubt<br> If Elfinhart would e'er have spoken out,<br> And told the fairies of her wish to leave them,<br> (A wish her conscious heart well knew would grieve them),<br> If in the ripening of her silent thought<br> A still voice had not whispered that she ought<br> To leave that world of love and mirth and beauty,<br> To share man's burden in this world of duty.<br> (There's anticlimax for you!  Most provoking,<br> Just when you thought that I was only joking,<br> Or idly fingering the poet's laurel,<br> To find my story threatens to be moral!<br> But as for morals, though in verse we scout them,<br> In life we somehow can't get on without them;<br> So if I don't insert a moral distich<br> Once in a while, I can't be realistic;--<br> And in this tale, I solemnly aver,<br> My one wish is to tell things as they were!<br> But not <i> all</i>  things; time flies, and art is long,<br> And I must hurry onward with my song.)<br> How Elfinhart at last told what she wanted,<br> And what the fairies said, please take for granted.<br> She prayed, they yielded; Elfinhart full loth<br> To leave, as they to let her go, but both<br> Agreeing that this bitter thing must be;<br> For they were fairies, and a mortal she.<br> But ere they yielded, they made imposition<br> Of what then seemed to her a light condition.<br> 'T was done in kindness, be it understood,<br> With fairy foresight for the maiden's good.<br> The elf-queen spoke for all: "Dear Elfinhart,<br> We bind you to one promise ere we part.<br> We fear naught from men's malice; hate and wrath<br> And every evil thing will shun your path,<br> And sunshine will go with you when you move;<br> The only danger that we dread is love.<br> If in the after days, when suitors woo you,<br> Your heart makes choice of one, as dearest to you,<br> Before you put your hand in his and own<br> The sacred trust reserved for him alone,<br> Let us make trial of him, and approve<br> His virtue, and his manhood, and his love.<br> Send him to us; and if he bears the test,<br> And if we find him worthy to be blest<br> With love like yours, be sure we will befriend him;<br> And may a life-long happiness attend him!<br> But if he prove a traitor, or faint-hearted,<br> Or if his love and he are lightly parted,<br> In the deep willow-woods he shall remain,<br> And never look upon your face again!"<br> The maiden, fancy-free, was well content,<br> And with light laughter gave her full consent;<br> For when maids think of love (as maidens do)<br> It seems a far-off thing; and well she knew<br> Her lover, if she loved, would be both brave and true!<br> Not long thereafter came an errant band<br> Riding along the edge of Fairyland,--<br> Stout men-at-arms, without reproach or spot,<br> And in the lead the bold Sir Launcelot.<br> He, riding on ahead, silent, alone,<br> Was stopped by a beseeching ancient crone<br> Who hobbled to his side, as if in pain,<br> And clutched with palsied fingers at his rein.<br> And there behind her, from the leafage green,<br> The sweetest eyes his eyes had ever seen<br> Were gazing at him with wide wonderment,<br> Not bold or fearful; innocence unshent<br> Shone from their blue depths, and old dreams awoke<br> In Launcelot's breast, while thus the beldame spoke:<br> "A boon, a boon, Sir Launcelot of the Lake!<br> I pray you of your courtesy to take<br> This damsel to the King.  Her enemies<br> Have spoiled her of her birthright, and she flees<br> An innocent outcast from her wasted lands,<br> To lay her life and fortune in his hands."<br> She spoke, and vanished in the woodland shade.<br> <br> Then Launcelot, leaning over, helped the maid<br> To mount behind, and at an easy trot<br> They and the troop rode on to Camelot.<br> He asked no questions, for some fairy spell<br> Made light his heart, and told him all was well;<br> And as these two rode through the land together,<br> By dappled greenwood shade and sunlit heather,<br> Her soft voice in his ears, the innocent charm<br> Of her light, steady touch upon his arm,<br> Wrought magic in his soul.  That day, I ween,<br> Sir Launcelot well-nigh forgot his queen.<br> And Elfinhart (you knew those eyes were hers!)<br> Laughed with the silvery jingle of his spurs,<br> And from her heart the new world's rapture drove<br> All thought of Fairyland--excepting love.<br> <br> And so to high-towered Camelot they came,<br> The golden city,--now a shadowy name;<br> For over heath-clad hills the wild winds blow<br> Where Arthur's halls, a thousand years ago,<br> Bright with all far-fetched gems of curious art,<br> Shone brighter with the eyes of Elfinhart.<br> She came to Camelot; the king receives her;<br> And there for five glad years my story leaves her.<br> Five glad years, and this "episode" is done,<br> And we are back again at Canto I.<br> I write of merry jest and greenwood shade,<br> But tales of chivalry are not my trade;<br> So if you wish to read that five years' story<br> Of lady-love, romance, and martial glory,--<br> The mighty feats of arms that Gawayne did,--<br> The ever ripening love that Gawayne hid<br> Five long years in his breast, biding his time,--<br> Go seek it in some abler poet's rime.<br> My tale begins with the young knight's brave soul<br> All Elfinhart's.  She thinks herself heart-whole.<br> <br> But at that Christmas feast, in Arthur's hall,<br> With night's soft mantle folded over all,<br> The magic influence of the evening tide<br> Stole on their two hearts beating side by side.<br> And Gawayne talked of troubles long ago,<br> When each man's neighbour was his dearest foe,<br> And of the trials he himself had passed,<br> And the high purpose that from first to last<br> Had been his stay and spur, he scarce knew how,<br> Since on Excalibur he took the vow.<br> He told of his own hopes for future days,<br> And how he wrought and fought not for men's praise,<br> (Though like all good men Gawayne held that dear),<br> Yet trusting, when men laid him on his bier,<br> They might remember, as they gathered round it,<br> "He left this good world better than he found it."<br> He talked as true men seldom talk, unless<br> Swayed utterly by some pure passion's stress,<br> And ever gently, though with heart on fire,<br> Still hovered nearer to his soul's desire.<br> And Elfinhart in gravest silence listened,<br> But her sweet heart beat high, her blue eyes glistened;<br> For as he bared his soul to her she dreamed<br> A day-dream strange and new, wherein it seemed<br> That in that soul's clear depth she saw her own,<br> And his most secret thought (till then unknown)<br> Seemed hers eternally.  He spoke of death,<br> And then her heart shrank, and she drew deep breath.<br> Suddenly, ere she understood it all<br> What new life dawned before her, came the call<br> Of fairy horns; and so the Green Knight burst<br> Upon the scene, as told in Canto First.<br> <br> One jarring note, the tuneful chords among,<br> May make mad discord of the sweetest song.<br> E'en so with dissonant clamor through the breast<br> Of Gawayne rang the Green Knight's merry jest;<br> But what wild meaning must it not impart<br> To the vague fears of gentle Elfinhart?<br> For she had heard in the first trumpet-blast<br> A signal to her from the far-gone past;<br> And now, of all the strange things that had been,<br> Her half forgotten compact with the queen<br> Flushed through her memory, and a swift thought came<br> Like sudden fear, a thought without a name,<br> An unvoiced question and a blind alarm;<br> And in sheer helplessness she reached an arm<br> Toward Gawayne, scarcely knowing what she would;<br> Her eyes beheld him, and she understood.<br> And is it Gawayne?  He?  Yes, Elfinhart,<br> The hour has come, and you must play your part.<br> <br> So now it's all explained; and I intend<br> To go straight onward to the story's end.<br> Sir Gawayne had cut off the Green Knight's head,<br> And Arthur and his court had gone to bed;<br> In the great hall the dying embers shone<br> With a faint ghostly gleam, and there, alone,<br> While all the rest of Camelot was sleeping,<br> In the dark alcove Elfinhart lay weeping.<br> But as she lay there, all about her head<br> There fell a checkered beam of moonlight, shed<br> Through the barred casement; and she faintly stirred,<br> For in her troubled soul it seemed she heard<br> Vague music from some region far away.<br> She raised her head and, turning where she lay,<br> Saw in the silver moonlight the serene<br> And tranquil beauty of the fairy queen!<br> <br> "We sent before you called us, Elfinhart,<br> For love lent keener magic to our art,<br> And warned us of the thoughts that in your breast<br> Awoke new rapture, trembling unconfessed."<br> And Elfinhart moved closer to her knees<br> And hid her face in the white draperies<br> That veiled the fairy form, till, nestling there,<br> Her heart recovered from that blank despair,<br> And whispered her that whatsoe'er befell<br> Love ruled the world, and all would yet be well.<br> And the good fairy stroked the maiden's head<br> And kissed her tear-starred eyes, and smiling said:<br> "Fie on you women's hearts!  Consistency<br> Hides her shamed head where mortal women be!<br> True love breeds faith and trust, it makes hearts strong;<br> The heart's anointed king can do no wrong!<br> And yet you weep as if you feared to prove him;--<br> Upon my word, I don't believe you love him!"<br> And Elfinhart replied: "Laugh if you will,<br> My queen, but let me be a woman still.<br> You fairies love where love is wise and just;<br> We mortal women love because we must:<br> And if I feared to prove him, I confess<br> I fear I still must love him none the less."<br> She paused, for once again her eyes grew dim:<br> "Think you I love his virtues?  I love him!<br> But yet you judged me wrongly, for believe me,<br> (And then laugh once again, and so forgive me),<br> If at the first I feared what you might do,<br> My doubts were not of Gawayne, but of you!"<br> And so both laughed, and for a little space<br> Folded each other in a glad embrace;<br> (For fairies, bathed the whole year round in bliss,<br> May yet be gladdened by a fair maid's kiss);<br> And Elfinhart spoke on: "Do what you will,<br> I trust you with my all, and fear no ill.<br> But oh, my friend, to wait the long, long year,--<br> To keep my heart in silence, not to hear<br> The words my whole soul hungers for, nor say<br> One syllable to brighten his dark day!<br> Must it be so, my queen?  And how shall I<br> School eyes and lips to act this year-long lie?<br> From the dear teacher-guardian of my youth<br> The only ways I learned were ways of truth!<br> I tried my skill this night, and learned to know<br> That there are deeps below the deeps of woe;<br> Hearts may be bruised and broken, yet still live;--<br> The wounds that kill us are the wounds we give!"<br> <br> And so these two talked on, until the night<br> Began to shiver with the gray dawn's light,<br> And in the deep-dyed casement they might see<br> New life flush through old dreams of chivalry.<br> And then they parted.  What the queen had said<br> I know not, but the lady, comforted,<br> Bade farewell with calm voice and tranquil eyes,<br> And saw with new-born strength the new sun rise.<br> Perhaps in Fairyland there chanced to be<br> For them that grieve some sovereign alchemy<br> To turn the worst to best, and the good queen<br> Applied this soothing balm. Such things have been;<br> But yet I doubt if any fairy art<br> Was needed in the case of Elfinhart;<br> The medicine that charmed away her dole<br> Nature had planted in her own sweet soul.<br> Of all sure things, this thing I'm surest of,--<br> That the best cure for love's own ills is love.<br> <br> 	   CANTO III.<br> 	    GAWAYNE.<br> <br> O Muse!--But no: heaven knows I need a muse;<br> But which of all the nine, pray, should I choose?<br> Thalia, Clio, and Melpomene,<br> I love them all, but none, alas, loves me;<br> For if you want a muse to take your part<br> You must be solely hers with all your heart;<br> And I have mingled since my earliest youth<br> My smiles and tears, my fictions and my truth;<br> Nay, in this very tale, scarce yet half done,<br> I've courted all the nine, and so won none!<br> Not for me, therefore, the Parnassian lyre,<br> Or winged war-horse shod with heavenly fire;<br> Harsh numbers flow from throats whose thirst has been<br> A whole life long unslaked of Hippocrene;<br> But I will e'en go on as best I can<br> And let the story end as it began,--<br> A plain, straightforward man's unvarnished word,<br> Part sad, part sweet,--and part of it absurd.<br> <br> A year passed by, as years are wont to do,<br> Winter and spring, summer and autumn too,<br> Till mid-December's flaw-blown flakes of snow<br> Warned Gawayne that the time was come to go<br> To the Green Chapel by the Murmuring Mere,<br> And take again the blow he gave last year.<br> In the great court his charger stamped the ground,<br> While knights and weeping ladies thronged around<br> To arm him (as the custom was of yore)<br> And bid him sad farewell for evermore.<br> One face alone in all that bustling throng<br> Our hero's eyes sought eagerly, and long<br> Sought vainly; for the lady Elfinhart,<br> Debating with herself, stood yet apart;<br> But as Sir Gawayne gathered up his reins<br> And bade the draw-bridge warden loose the chains,<br> Suddenly Elfinhart stood by his side,<br> Her fair face flushed with love, and joy, and pride.<br> She plucked a sprig of holly from her gown<br> And looked up, questioning; and he leaned down,<br> And so she placed it in his helm.  No word<br> Might Gawayne's lips then utter, but he heard<br> The voice that was his music, and could feel<br> The touch of gentle fingers through the steel.<br> "Wear this, Sir Gawayne, for a loyal friend<br> Whose hopes and prayers go with you to the end."<br> And, staying not for answer, she withdrew,<br> And in the throng was lost to Gawayne's view.<br> He roused himself, and waving high his hand,<br> Struck spur, and so rode off to Fairyland.<br> <br> Long time he traveled by an unknown way,<br> Unhoused at night, companionless by day.<br> The cold sleet stung him through his shirt of mail,<br> But, underneath, his stout heart would not fail,<br> But beat full measure through the fiercest storm,<br> And kept his head clear and his brave soul warm.<br> No need to tell the perils that he passed;<br> He conquered all, and came unscathed at last<br> To where a high-embattled castle stood<br> Deep in the heart of a dense willow-wood.<br> And Gawayne called aloud, and to the gate<br> A smiling porter came, who opened straight,<br> And bade him enter in and take his rest;<br> And Gawayne entered, and the people pressed<br> About him with fair speeches; and he laid<br> His armor off, and gave it them, and prayed<br> That they would take his message to their lord,--<br> A prayer for friendly shelter, bed and board.<br> He told them whence he was, his birth and name;<br> And the bold baron of the castle came,<br> A mighty man, huge-limbed, with flashing eyes,<br> And welcomed him with old-time courtesies;<br> For manners, in those days, were held of worth,<br> And gentle breeding went with gentle birth.<br> He heartily was glad his guest had come,<br> And made Sir Gawayne feel himself at home;<br> And as they walked in, side by side, each knew<br> The other for an honest man and true.<br> <br> That night our hero and the baron ate<br> A sumptuous dinner in the hall of state,<br> And all the household, ranged along the board,<br> Made good cheer with Sir Gawayne and their lord,<br> And passed the brimming bowl right merrily<br> With friendly banter and quick repartee.<br> And Gawayne asked if they had chanced to hear<br> Of a Green Chapel by a Murmuring Mere,<br> And straightway all grew grave.  Within his breast<br> Sir Gawayne felt a tremor of unrest,<br> But told his story with a gay outside,<br> And asked for some good man to be his guide<br> To find his foe.  "I promise him," said he,<br> "No golden guerdon;--his reward shall be<br> The consciousness that unto him 't was given<br> To show a parting soul the way to heaven!"<br> <br> Up jumped his host.  "My friend, I like your attitude,<br> And know no surer way to win heaven's gratitude<br> Than sending thither just such men as you;<br> I'll be your guide.  But since you are not due<br> At the Green Chapel till three nights from now,<br> And since the way is short, I'll tell you how<br> The interim may be disposed of best:--<br> In short, let me propose a merry jest!"<br> At this Sir Gawayne gave a sudden start,<br> For some old memory seemed to clutch his heart,<br> And in the baron's eyes he seemed to see<br> A twinkling gleam of green benignity<br> Not wholly strange; but like a flash 't was gone.<br> Gawayne sank back, and his good host went on:<br> "Two days you sojourn here, and while I take<br> My daily hunting in the wood, you make<br> My house and castle yours; and then, each night,<br> We'll meet together here at candle-light,<br> And all my winnings in the wood, and all<br> That comes to you at home, whate'er befall,<br> We'll give each other in exchange; in fine,<br> My fortune shall be yours, and yours be mine."<br> To Gawayne this seemed generous indeed.<br> And with most cordial laughter he agreed.<br> They clasped hands o'er the bargain with good zest,<br> And then all said good-night, and went to rest.<br> <br> Next morning Gawayne was awakened early<br> From a deep slumber by the hurly-burly<br> Of footman, horseman, seneschal, and groom,<br> Bustling beneath the windows of his room.<br> He rose and looked out, just in time to see<br> The baron and a goodly company<br> Of huntsmen, armed with cross-bow, axe, and spear,<br> Ride through the castle gate and disappear.<br> And then, while Gawayne dressed, there came a knock<br> Upon his chamber door.  He threw the lock,<br> And a boy page brought robes of ermine fur<br> And Tarsic silk,--black, white and lavender,--<br> For his array, and with them a kind message,<br> Which the good knight received with no ill presage:<br> "Will brave Sir Gawayne spare an idle hour<br> For quiet converse in my lady's bower?"<br> The boy led on, and Gawayne followed him<br> Through crooked corridors and archways dim,<br> Along low galleries echoing from afar,<br> And down a winding stair; then "Here we are!"<br> The page cried cheerily, and paused before<br> The massive carvings of an antique door.<br> This he swung open; and the knight passed through<br> Into a garden, fresh with summer dew!<br> A lady's bower in Fairyland!  What pen<br> Could make that strange enchantment live again?<br> Not he who drew Acrasia's Bower of Bliss<br> And Ph&aelig;dria's happy isle could picture this.<br> That sweet-souled Puritan discerned too well<br> The serpent's coil behind the witch's spell;<br> And he who saw--when the dark veil was torn--<br> The rose of Paradise without the thorn,<br> (Sublimest prophet, whose immortal verse<br> Lent mightier thunders to the primal curse),<br> Even he too sternly, in the soul's defense,<br> Repressed the still importunate cries of sense.<br> Bid me not, therefore, task my feebler pen<br> With dreams beyond the limits of their ken;<br> The phantom conjurings of the magic hour<br> That Gawayne passed in that enchanted bower<br> Must be from mortal eyes forever hid.<br> But yet some part of what he felt and did<br> These lines must needs disclose.  As he stood there,<br> Breathing soft odors from the mellow air,<br> All hopes, all aims of noble knighthood seemed<br> Like the dim yesterdays of one who dreamed,<br> In starless caves of memory sunken deep,<br> And, like lost music, folded in strange sleep.<br> <br> "How long, O mortal man, wilt thou give heed<br> To the world's phantom voices?  The hours speed,<br> And fame and fortune yield to moth and rust,<br> And good and evil crumble into dust.<br> Even now the sands are running in the glass;<br> Set not your heart upon vain things that pass;<br> Ambitions, honors, toils, are but the snare<br> Where lurks for aye the blind old world's despair.<br> Nay, quiet the bootless striving in your breast<br> And let your tired heart here at last find rest.<br> In vain have joy, love, beauty, struck deep root<br> In your heart's heart, unless you pluck the fruit;<br> Then put away the cheating soul's pretense,<br> Heap high the press, fill full the cup of sense;<br> Shatter the idols of blind yesterday,<br> And let love, joy, and beauty reign alway!"<br> <br> Such thoughts as these, confused and unexpressed,<br> Flooded the silence in Sir Gawayne's breast.<br> Meanwhile a brasier filled the scented air<br> With wreaths of magic mist, and he was ware<br> That the mist drew together like a shroud;<br> And then the veil was rent, and in the cloud<br> Stood one who seemed, in features, form, and dress,<br> The perfect image of all loveliness.<br> <br> The wonders of that vision none could tell<br> Save one whose heart had felt the mystic spell.<br> Once and once only, in the golden days<br> When youth made melody for love's sweet lays,<br> In two dark eyes (yet oh, how bright, how bright!)<br> I saw the wakening rapture of love's light,<br> And, in the hush of that still dawning, heard<br> From two sweet trembling lips love's whispered word.<br> The twilight deepens when the sun has set;<br> In memory golden glories linger yet;<br> But these avail not.  Though my soul lay bare,<br> With all those memories sanctuaried there,<br> That spell was human.  But the unseen power<br> That wove the witchery of this fairy bower,<br> In Gawayne's heart such subtle magic wrought<br> That past and future were well-nigh forgot,<br> And all that earth holds else, or heaven above,<br> Seemed naught worth keeping, save this dream of love.<br> <br> And now, as the strange cloud of incense broke,<br> The vision, if it were a vision, spoke,--<br> If it were speech that filled the quivering air<br> With low harmonious music.  Let none dare<br> In the rude jargons of this world to fashion<br> That sweet, wild anthem of unearthly passion.<br> Could I from the broad-billowing ocean borrow<br> Of Tristan's love and of Isolde's sorrow,<br> The flood of those world-darkening surges, wrought<br> With thoughts that lie beyond the reach of thought,<br> Might bring me succor where weak words must fail.<br> But Gawayne saw and heard, and passion-pale<br> Shrank back, and made a darkness of his face;<br> (As though the unplumbed deeps of starless space<br> Could quench those lustrous eyes, or close his ears<br> To the eternal music of love's spheres!)<br> But the voice changed, and Gawayne, listening there,<br> Heard now a heart's low cry of wild despair.<br> He turned again, and lo!  the vision knelt<br> And drew a jeweled poniard from her belt,<br> To arm herself against her own dear life;<br> But as she bared her white breast to the knife<br> He started quickly forward, and he grasped<br> The hand that held the hilt; and then she clasped<br> Her soft arms round his neck, and as their lips<br> Met in the shadowing fold of love's eclipse,<br> All earth, all heaven, all knightly hopes of grace,<br> Died in the darkness of one blind embrace.<br> <br> Died?  Nay; for Gawayne, ere the moment passed,<br> Broke from the arms that strove to bind him fast,<br> And turned away once more;  and, as he pressed<br> A trembling hand against his throbbing breast,<br> His aimless fingers touched a treasured part<br> Of the green holly-branch of Elfinhart,<br> Laid in his breast when he put off his arms.<br> What perils now are left in fairy charms?<br> For poets fable when they call love blind;<br> Love's habitation is the purer mind,<br> Whence with his keen eyes he may penetrate<br> All mists and fogs that baser spells create.<br> Love?  What is love?  Not the wild feverish thrill,<br> When heart to heart the thronging pulses fill,<br> And lips that close in parching kisses find<br> No speech but those;--the best remains behind.<br> The tranquil spirit--the divine assurance<br> That this life's seemings have a high endurance--<br> Thoughts that allay this restless striving, calm<br> The passionate heart, and fill old wounds with balm;--<br> These are the choirs invisible that move<br> In white processionals up the aisles of love.<br> <br> Such love was Gawayne's,--love that sanctifies<br> The heart's most secret altar; and his eyes<br> Were opened, and his pulses beat once more<br> Their old true rhythm.  And so the strife was o'er,<br> And all the perilous wiles of magic art<br> Were foiled by Gawayne--and by Elfinhart.<br> <br> But time flies, and 't were tedious to delay<br> My song for all the trials of that day.<br> Light summer breezes, skurrying o'er the deep,<br> Ripple and foam and flash,--then sink to sleep;<br> But underneath, serene and changing never,<br> The mighty heart of ocean beats forever,<br> And his deep streams renew from pole to pole<br> The living world's indomitable soul.<br> Enough, then, of the spells that vexed the brain<br> Of Gawayne; love and knighthood made all vain.<br> And in the afternoon, when Gawayne learned<br> That his good host, the baron, had returned,<br> He met him in the hall at candle-light,<br> According to his promise of last night.<br> And then the baron motioned to a page,<br> And straightway six tall men, of lusty age<br> And mighty sinews, entered the great door,<br> Bearing the carcass of a huge wild boar,<br> In all its uncouth ugliness complete,<br> And dropped it quivering at our hero's feet.<br> "What do you say to that, Sir Gawayne?" cried<br> The baron, swelling with true sportman's pride<br> "But come: your promise, now, of yester-eve;<br> 'T is blesseder to give than to receive!<br> Though I'll be sworn you'll find it hard to pay<br> Full value for the winnings of this day."<br> "Not so," said Gawayne; "you will rest my debtor;<br> Your gift is good, but mine will be far better."<br> And then he strode with solemn steps along<br> The echoing hall, and through the listening throng,<br> And with the words, "My noble lord, take this!"<br> He gave the baron a resounding kiss.<br> The baron jumped up in ecstatic glee.<br> "Now by my great-great-grandsire's beard," quoth he,<br> "Better than all dead boars in Christendom<br> Is one sweet loving kiss!--Whence did it come?"<br> "Nay, there," Sir Gawayne said, "you step beyond<br> The terms we stipulated in our bond.<br> Take you my kiss in peace, as I your boar;<br> Be glad; give thanks;--and seek to know no more."<br> Loud laughter made the baron's eyes grow bright<br> And glitter with green sparkles of delight;<br> And then he chuckled: "Sir, I'm proud of you;<br> I drink your best of health; <i> I think you'll do!</i> "<br> <br> And now the board was laid and dressed, and all<br> Sat down to dinner at the baron's call;<br> And Gawayne looked along the room askance,<br> Seeking the lady; and he caught one glance<br> Of laughing eyes--then looked away in haste,<br> But turned again, and wondered why his taste<br> Had erred so strangely, for the lady seemed<br> Not fairer now than others.  Had he dreamed?<br> He rubbed his eyes and pondered,--though in sooth<br> Without one glimmering presage of the truth,--<br> Till all passed lightly from his puzzled mind,<br> Leaving contentment and good cheer behind.<br> So all the company feasted well, and sped<br> The flying hours, till it was time for bed.<br> <br> One whole day longer must our hero rest<br> Within doors, to fulfill the merry jest.<br> So when, next morning, Gawayne once more heard<br> The hunt's-up in the court, he never stirred,<br> But let the merry horsemen ride away<br> While he slept soundly well into the day.<br> Later he rose, and strolled from room to room,<br> Through vaulted twilights of ancestral gloom,<br> Until, descending a long stair, he found<br> The dim-lit castle crypt, deep under ground,<br> Where sculptured effigies forever kept<br> Their long last marble silence as they slept,<br> And iron sentinels, on bended knees,<br> Held eyeless vigil in old panoplies.<br> <br> Sir Gawayne, wandering on in aimless mood,<br> Pondered the tomb-stone legends, quaint and rude,<br> Wherein the pensive dreamer might divine<br> A tragic history in every line;<br> For so does fate, with bitterest irony,<br> Epitomize fame's immortality,<br> Perpetuating for all after days<br> Mute lamentations and unnoted praise.<br> And Gawayne, reading here and there the story<br> Of fame obscure and unremembered glory,<br> Found on a tablet these words: "Where he lies,<br> The gray wave breaks and the wild sea-mew flies:<br> If any be that loved him, seek not here,<br> But in the lone hills by the Murmuring Mere."<br> A nameless cenotaph!  perhaps of one<br> Like Gawayne's self deluded and undone<br> By the green stranger; and the legend brought<br> A tide of passion flooding Gawayne's thought;<br> A flood-tide, not of fear,--for Gawayne's breast<br> Shrank never at the perilous behest<br> Of noble knighthood,--but the love of life,<br> Compassion, and soul-sickness of the strife.<br> "If any be that loved him!"  Oh, to die<br> Far from green-swarded Camelot, and lie<br> Among these bleak and barren hills alone,<br> His end unwept for and his grave unknown,--<br> Never again to see the glad sunrise<br> That brightened all his world in those dear eyes!<br> <br> Half suffocating in the charneled air<br> Of that low vault, he staggered up the stair,<br> Out of the dim-lit halls of silent death<br> Into the living light, and drew quick breath<br> Where, through a casement-arch of ivied stone,<br> Bright from the clear blue sky the warm sun shone.<br> The whole of life's glad rapture thrilled his heart;<br> Till a quick step behind him made him start,<br> And there, deep-veiled, in muffling cloak and hood,<br> Once more the lady of the castle stood.<br> <br> Low-voiced she spoke, as if with studied care<br> Weighing the syllables of her parting prayer.<br> "Sir Gawayne--nay, I pray you, turn not yet,<br> But hear me;-- though my heart may not forget<br> That once, for one sweet moment, you were kind,<br> I come not to recall that to your mind;--<br> Between us two be love's words aye unspoken!<br> Yet ere you go, I pray you, leave some token<br> That in the long, long years may comfort me<br> For the dear face I nevermore shall see."<br> "Nay, lady," said the knight, "I have no gifts<br> To give you.  Errant knighthood ever drifts<br> From shore to shore, by wandering breezes blown,<br> With naught save its good name to call its own.<br> In friendship, then, I pray you keep for me<br> My name untarnished in your memory."<br> "Ah, sir," she said, "my memory bears that name<br> Burnt in with characters of living flame.<br> But though you give me naught, I pray you take<br> This girdle from me;--wear it for my sake;<br> Nay, but refuse me not; you little know<br> Its magic power.  I had it long ago<br> From Fairyland; and its encircling charm<br> Keeps scathless him who wears it from all harm;<br> No evil thing can touch him.  Gird it on,<br> If but to ease my heart when you are gone."<br> <br> She held a plain green girdle in her hand,<br> In outward seeming just a narrow band<br> Of silk, with silver clasps; but in those days<br> The strangest things were wrought in simplest ways,<br> As Gawayne knew full well; and he could see<br> That all the lady said was verity.<br> He took the girdle, held it, fingered it,<br> Then clasped it round his waist to try the fit,<br> Irresolutely dallying with temptation,<br> Till conscience grew too weak for inclination;<br> For at the last he threw one wandering glance<br> Out at the casement, and the merry dance<br> Of sparkling sunbeams on the fields of snow<br> Wrought havoc in his wavering heart; and so,<br> Repeating to himself one word: "Life, life!"<br> He took the token from the baron's wife.<br> <br> That evening, when the baron and our knight<br> Met to exchange their gifts at candle-light,<br> The baron, looking graver than before,<br> Said: "Sir, my luck has left me; not a boar<br> Did we get wind of, all this blessed day.<br> I come with empty hands, only to pray<br> Your pardon.  What good fortune do <i> you</i>  bring?"<br> And Gawayne answered firmly: "Not a thing!"<br> <br> 	     CANTO IV<br> 	    CONCLUSION.<br> <br> By noon the next day, Gawayne and his host<br> Rode side by side along the perilous coast<br> Of the gray Mere, from whose unquiet sleep<br> Reverberating murmurs of the deep<br> Startled the still December's listening air.<br> The baron, shuddering, pointed seaward.  "There,"<br> He said, "year in, year out, these voices haunt<br> That fearful water; heaven knows what they want!<br> Men tell me--and I have no doubt it's true--<br> They are knights-errant whom the Green Knight slew!<br> Woe unto him, the over-bold, who dares<br> Adventure near that uncouth monster's snares!"<br> Quoth Gawayne: "How have<i> you</i>  escaped the net?"<br> The baron answered: "I?  We never met!<br> When I'm about, he seems to shun the place,<br> And where he is, I never show my face;<br> But if we did meet, 't would be safe to say<br> Not more than one of us would get away!"<br> <br> And then the baron told tales by the score<br> About the Green Knight's quenchless thirst for gore,<br> And kept repeating that no magic charm<br> Was proof against the prowess of his arm;<br> At his first blow each vain defense must fall,<br> For he was arch-magician over all.<br> And as from tale to tale the baron ran,<br> Sir Gawayne, had he been another man,<br> Would certainly have felt his heart's blood curdle,<br> Despite his secret wearing of the girdle;<br> But when the baron finally suggested<br> Abandoning the venture, and protested<br> That the whole monstrous business was absurd,<br> Sir Gawayne simply said: "I gave my word.<br> And when the baron saw he would not bend,<br> He seemed to lose all patience.  "Well, my friend,<br> I'll go no further with you.  On your head<br> Shall be your own mad blood when you are dead.<br> Yonder your two roads fork; pause there, I pray,<br> And ponder well before you choose your way.<br> One takes the hills, one winds along the wave;<br> To Camelot this,--the other to your grave!<br> Choose the high road, Sir Gawayne; shun the danger!<br> Say you were misdirected by a stranger;--<br> I swear by all that's sacred, I'll not tell<br> One syllable to a soul:--and so farewell!"<br> He galloped off without another word,<br> And vanished where the road turned.  Gawayne heard,<br> Long after he had disappeared, the sound<br> Of iron hoof-beats on the frozen ground,<br> Till all had died into silence, save those drear<br> And hollow voices from the Murmuring Mere.<br> <br> But Gawayne chose the lower road, and passed<br> Along the desolate shore.  The die was cast.<br> The western skies, as the red sun sank low,<br> Cast purple shades across the drifted snow,<br> And Gawayne knew that the dread hour was come<br> For the fulfillment of his martyrdom.<br> And now, from just beyond a jutting hill,<br> Came hideous sounds, as of a giant mill<br> That hisses, roars, and sputters, clicks and clacks;--<br> It was the Green Knight sharpening his axe!<br> And Gawayne, coming past the corner, found him,<br> With ghastly mouldering skulls and bones strewn round him,<br> In joyous fury urging the keen steel<br> Against the surface of his grinding wheel.<br> The place was a wild hollow, circled round<br> With barren hills, and on the bottom ground<br> Stood the Green Chapel, moss-grown, solitary;--<br> In sooth, it seemed the devil's mortuary!<br> The Green Knight's back was turned, and he stirred not<br> Till Gawayne hailed him sharply; then he shot<br> One glance--as when, o'erhead, a living wire<br> Startles the night with flashes of green fire;--<br> Then hurried forward, bland as bland could be,<br> And greeted Gawayne with green courtesy.<br> "Dear sir, I ask a thousand pardons; pray<br> Forgive me.  You are punctual to the day;<br> That's good!  Of course I knew you would not fail.<br> How do you do?  You look a trifle pale;<br> I trust, with all my heart, you are not ill?<br> Just the cold air?  It does blow rather chill!<br> What can I do to cheer you?  Let me see;--<br> Suppose I brew a cup of hot green tea?<br> You'ld rather not?  You're pressed for time?  Of course,<br> I understand; then just get off your horse,<br> And I'll do all I can to expedite<br> Our little business for you.  There, that's right;<br> And now your helmet?  Thanks; and if you please<br> Perhaps you'll kindly kneel down on your knees,<br> As I did when I came to Camelot; So!<br> Are you all ready?  Will you bide the blow?"<br> And Gawayne said "I will," in such soft notes<br> As happy bridegrooms utter, when their throats<br> Are paralyzed with blest anticipation;--<br> (What Gawayne looked for was decapitation!)<br> And then the Green Knight swung his axe in air<br> With a loud whirr; and Gawayne, kneeling there,<br> Shrank back an inch; and the green giant stayed<br> His threatening hand, and with a cold sneer said:<br> "You shrink, sir, from the axe; I can't hit true<br> Unles you hold still, as I did for you."<br> "Your pardon," Gawayne said, with bated breath;<br> "This time I swear to hold as still as death."<br> He did so, and the Green Knight swung again<br> His axe, and whirled it round his head, and then,<br> Pausing a second time, said: "Very good!<br> You're holding quite still now; I knew you would!"<br> Gawayne, in anger, said: "Jest, if you like,<br> After the blow; tarry no longer; strike!"<br> So once again the ponderous axe was raised;<br> But this time down it came, and lightly grazed<br> Sir Gawayne's neck.  He felt the hot blood flow,<br> And saw red drops that sank into the snow,<br> And then he jumped up, faced his foe, and cried:<br> "Enough: you owed me one blow, though I died;<br> But be you man or beast or devil abhorred,<br> I yield no further; with my mortal sword<br> I do defy you; and if mortal man<br> May hope against". . .<br> 			But the Green Knight began<br> A low melodious laugh, like running brooks<br> Whose pebbly babble fills the shadowy nooks<br> Of green-aisled woodlands, when the winds are still.<br> "My friend, we bear each other no ill will.<br> When first I swung my axe, you showed some fear;<br> I owed you that much for your blow last year.<br> The second time I swung,--yet spared your life,--<br> That paid you for the kiss you gave my wife!"<br> "Your wife!"  "My wife, Sir Gawayne; 't was my word;<br> And when I swung my weapon for the third<br> And last time, then I made the red blood spirt<br> For that green girdle underneath your shirt!<br> You played me false, my friend!"<br> 				And Gawayne knelt<br> Once more, and casting off the magic belt,<br> In bitter broken words confessed his shame,<br> And begged the Green Knight to avenge the name<br> Of injured knighthood, and with one last blow<br> To end his guilty life.  "Nay, nay, not so,"<br> The other softly said.  "Be of good cheer;<br> Your fault was small, for all men hold life dear.<br> We tempted you, my friend, with all our might,<br> And proved you in good sooth a noble knight;<br> A veritable Joseph, sir, you are!"<br> Quoth Gawayne drily, "Thanks, Lord Potiphar!<br> But may I ask you why you played this part?"<br> The other said: "Ask Lady Elfinhart!"<br> <br> He smiled, and from his smile a genial glow<br> Of green mid-summer seemed to overflow,<br> Filling with verdure all that barren place.<br> The warm red blood rushed to Sir Gawayne's face;<br> He caught his breath, and in his eager eyes<br> There shone a sudden flash of dark surmise,<br> And then he stood a long time pondering;<br> But in his breast his heart began to sing<br> The old, old music whose still echoes roll<br> Forever voiceless through the listening soul.<br> He said farewell to his good fairy friend<br> As in a dream, where real and unreal blend<br> In phantom unison, and with the light<br> Of love to lead him home, rode through the night,<br> Beside the tranquil murmurs of the Mere,<br> And through the silence of the passing year;<br> And earth and sea and starlit sky took part<br> In the still exaltation of his heart,<br> While all but love and wonder was forgot,<br> Until he came to high-towered Camelot.<br> <br> To Camelot he came, and there he found<br> The good King Arthur and his Table Round<br> Awaiting his return in anxious doubt;<br> But ere he passed the gates a mighty shout<br> Rose from the watchmen on the outward wall<br> And bore the tidings to the inmost hall.<br> From every window flaunting flags were flung;<br> From the high battlements brass trumpets sung;<br> And great bells, chiming in the topmost tower,<br> Pealed salutation to the joyous hour,<br> As Gawayne, riding through the cullis-port,<br> Faced the glad throng that filled the palace court.<br> <br> And with this tribute paid to knightly glory<br> It seems most fitting to conclude my story.<br> Entreat me not, dear reader, to impart<br> Further of Gawayne, or of Elfinhart.<br> Let your own fancy round the story out<br> Whatever way you please; I cannot doubt<br> The sequel; but when I, in silent thought,<br> Had brought Sir Gawayne back to her, and sought<br> With hand profane to lift the veil, behind<br> Whose secret shelter their two hearts enshrined<br> The mutual covenant of love's mystery,<br> That pure fane would not desecrated be.<br> But this alone I know: the power that wove<br> Through human lives the warp and woof of love<br> Wrought not in darkness, nor with hand unsure;--<br> His fabric must forevermore endure.<br> And hence I doubt not that these two were blest<br> As none may be, save they who have confessed<br> Allegiance to that mighty spirit's law,<br> And trod his holy ground with reverent awe.
