The first one glared at her<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spurned her with her foot and slunk away.<br>  So passed he to the land where none can err;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sire of Nurture. Let the gaunt wolf bay,<br>  And the tall-antlered red-deer couch secure,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad-winged heron fearless cleave the grey;<br>  No bowman lives can draw a bolt so sure;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumb are his deep-mouthed boar-hounds of Albayne,<br>  His falcons-royal heedless of the lure!<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, too, Merlin, he who wooed in vain<br>  The grace of that fair Lady of the Lake<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who nursed Sir Lancelot--cometh not again!<br>  Snared in the charm he taught her for love's sake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoary Wizard haunts the thorny brere,<br>  And wastes his marvels on the wild-wood brake.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still not seldom may the Hermit hear<br>  A dolorous hint at dusk in the Waste Land;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And caitiff horseman, felled by angry spear<br>  Five fathom o'er the croup with unseen hand,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surmise a dreary chuckle in the breeze<br>  Among the bare oaks of Brokeliand.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are forgotten. Yea, and more than these,<br>  Fair dame and lord, minstrel and knight and sage,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wrought and fought and loved and took their ease,<br>  Have wended forth on their last pilgrimage.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shameless drivel of unhallowed eld<br>  Morgana doteth on a lusty page<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the lakes o' the West, where once she held<br>  High court that vied with Arthur's court of yore:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, homeless wandering through her woods unspelled,<br>  The Fair Dame of the Forest Sans-retour<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath lost her chess-play and sweet carollings,<br>  Her greenwood bowers of dalliance all forlore.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, for those old May-days, when queens and kings<br>  Held court of Love amidst the Table Round,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she whose knight had done the worthiest things<br>  For her sole sake, though she and Fortune frowned,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard all the doughty deeds he did achieve<br>  And gave the guerdon as he sate there crowned!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O days of glory! O that Easter Eve<br>  In Table Round when Arthur sate in hall,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the kings from whom he did receive<br>  Homage and fee were vested with the pall<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crown and sceptre, vassals of his throne;<br>  While lordly heralds told with trumpet call<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole fair folk of fifteen realms his own!<br>  Aye, and the knights that won them, with loud voice<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those heralds blazoned, and their full renown,<br>  Even to the steeds that bare them, and the choice<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shield and token and enchanted brand,<br>  Galuth and Morglay, Florent, Marmyadoise,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the keen glory of the Arthurian hand!<br>  And when the heralds ceased, the Minstrel's chant<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound up the flowers of fame from every land.<br>  <br>  From Prester John the lily elephant<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare shells and incense of the imperial East,<br>  Cathaian ivories, gums of Garamant,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tall plumes of estrich, fells of spotted beast,<br>  With stuffs of Baldack and of Babylon<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a golden tower enfortaliced.<br>  <br>  And, twixt the seas of Caspian Amazon<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Alisaunder wrought the Walls of Weird<br>  Athwart the gateways of Mount Caucason,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With caitiff howling Magog shrank afeard<br>  Into his hollows, where on Antichrist<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever he raveth, rending his red beard.<br>  <br>  The Paynim Soudans, leagued in solemn tryst<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Nile to Tars, from Tars to Trebisound,<br>  Dismayed forgat their hoary feuds and kissed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at their altars grovelled all discrowned;<br>  To Belsabuk, Mahound and Apolyn<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrieking vain curses on the Table Round!<br>  <br>  Then, too, by faery, venturous wight could win<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the moonled swaying of the waves,<br>  The crystal marches of the deep within;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Arthur's name among the twilight caves<br>  Would scare the Grendel to her coral brake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cow the fell sea-unicorns like slaves!<br>  The Damsels of the Waters for his sake<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade summon all their gruesome treasurers,<br>  Orc, Kraken, and immeasurable Snake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To delve from out their whirl-pit sepulchres<br>  The peerless hoards of immemorial wreck<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whelmed o'er with bones of old-world mariners--<br>  Gem-talismans once gorgeous on the neck<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of queens of Tarshish--Idol's eyes of Ind,<br>  And moneys minted by Melchizedek.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, past the deep sea-dungeons of the wind,<br>  The Pilgrim heard the Hell-stream cataracts boom<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the abyss by flames eternal mined<br>  Through ice eternal to the chasm of doom:--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arthur!" he cried--one moment Hell was still,<br>  And "Arthur!" echoed through the seething gloom!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, and yet onward through the midnight chill<br>  Of desolate wastes beyond, where dawn is none,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erewhile rejoicing to the Holy Hill<br>  Through God's dear grace unspotted knight hath won,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the mystery of the Gates hath seen;<br>  Where o'er-against the birthstead of the sun<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulwarks glow of Paradise Terrene--<br>  The walls of jasper, sardonyx, and pearl<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With golden mortar molten in between:<br>  The crystal-carven canopies a-curl<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With emerald sprays of passion-flower and vine,<br>  And garnet grapes and topaz tendril whorl:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doors of starry diamond, with a twine<br>  Of sapphire hinges cusped with chrysoprase<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ruby studs and knops of almondine:--<br>  And, all opaque against the liquid blaze,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central, with sword and balance, helm and greave,<br>  The Archangel-champion, crowned with awful rays;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leftward Our Lady, whispering sweet reprieve<br>  To sinful father Adam, and to right<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Son, the Healer, comforting sad Eve.<br>  Yea, erst such marvel cheered the Pilgrim Knight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever about the Eternal Doors, like doves,<br>  Or poised or fluttered a celestial flight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Angels chanting in the trellised groves<br>  Of crest and corbel, cope and capital;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashing sweet sheen among the fretted coves<br>  And depths of amethystine interval<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In gabled eaves of niche and pinnacle,<br>  Or basking in fair alleys on the wall.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one from forth the blissful citadel<br>  Would hover toward the Palmer as he prayed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gift of water from the Fourfold Well<br>  Whence flow the streams of Eden, so allayed<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sovran virtue, that three drops alone<br>  Make whole all deadliest dint of mortal blade,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade him bear to Arthur on his throne<br>  That living token of immortal grace<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stopped in a cruse of hieroglyphic stone.<br>  <br>  So sang the poet in his pride of place,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Arthur bade the pages plenish well<br>  The cups of all the kings with wine of race,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osaye or Algarde, Rhenish or Rochell,<br>  Vernage of Venice, Rhodes or Famagust,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Malvoisie or Cretan Muscadel,--<br>  And pledged them all with outstretched arm august.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the lordly singer of his name,<br>  Still standing, he bade bear as guerdon just<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bugle carved in tusk of hippotame,<br>  And whale's-bone comb in casket of red gold.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sang the poet, and his songs were fame,<br>  For fame was truth, and true the tales he told,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For men believed them: All are falsehood now,<br>  For faith is lost alike in new and old.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, even high achievements, such as plough<br>  Their record deepest in men's memories<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are true no longer. Lo, as none knows how<br>  The splendour faileth out of sunset skies,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the long capes of the cloudland bay<br>  Like foam from seas of light the glory lies,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ere we mark it gloameth into grey,--<br>  So Truth hath died in talk at bench and board,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Preacher's holy lore and Poet's lay.<br>  <br>  Yea, men no more durst speak the manly word,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But waste their wit in woman jest and jeer;<br>  And courtly things that strut and wear a sword<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whisper to high-born dame, and crouch and leer<br>  And sneer a double meaning to the tale<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No loyal knight could tell nor maiden hear.<br>  Even in council, clad in useless mail,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gibe and chatter, each in fooling phrase<br>  Girding at other till their lips are pale<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such small wrath as in emasculate days<br>  May vent itself in slander and be safe.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have forgotten knightly words and ways,<br>  When gentle Chieftain at a glance would chafe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at a hinted slur clap hand to hilt.<br>  Honour is dead and Courtesy a waif<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None cares to treasure, now no blood is spilt<br>  To prove its value. Lie and give the lie,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lewd world will laugh away the guilt!<br>  Nor man nor woman now with stedfast eye<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall scathe the craven slanderer for his pains!<br>  <br>  Our dames are worthy of our chivalry.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their dull eyne a nightshade philtre feigns<br>  A fire unfelt and fondness not their own:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wan cheeks are flushed, unvermeiled of the veins,<br>  And brows disfurnished flaunt a spangled loan<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of saffron tress in pearl-y-fretted caul.--<br>  Now languid beauty luxeth her green zone<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starry with ouches on her purfled pall,<br>  And, whitely shuddering o'er the lees of lust,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clencheth her teeth and fingers to recall<br>  How frolic erst she quaffed the foamy must:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet doth she publish still as sumptuously<br>  Her lavish bosom blanched with pearly dust:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still with the smile which love ne'er lived to see,<br>  Wooeth in vain a withered knight to wait<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loop a posied loveknot at her knee.<br>  There is a dreadful secret in the State--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secret bruited at the Market-cross<br>  And blased by every lazar at the gate;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such secret as the gleeman's wit makes gross<br>  To wipe a tally off the ale-wife's score,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or earn a pandar's penny by his gloss.<br>  <br>  Lo, where she standeth by the Castle-door,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Weaver of the Secret--mid a band<br>  Of idling courtiers, dame and paramour,--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our queen, Ginevra; on her dainty hand<br>  A tercel gentle with a silken jess.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the sun Dame Meliot sees her stand,<br>  Scans her from head to foot, and falls to guess<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many marks might buy the violet hood<br>  Reversed with ermines on her auburn tress.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Dinadan lets loose his fooling mood<br>  And prates how old-world beauty wont to smile,--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elayne of Troy and that sweet Moor who wooed<br>  Heroes and aspics to her breast by Nile,--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judith and Cressid,--the fair queen who died<br>  For Duke Eneas, and the dame whose wile<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saddled and bridled for a summer ride<br>  The Sage who thought to tame Olympia's son--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panthasilee and Theseus' warrior-bride,--<br>  Swears that of all the bevy never a one<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was half so queenly, half so fair as she!<br>  <br>  And one with narrow eyes that durst meet none,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes felt the prying which she cannot see,<br>  Like a chill draught the casement chinks between:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mordred--and chews on treason yet to be.<br>  He, born of love where love should never have been,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Arthur's first-born--why not Arthur's heir?<br>  Ginevra is Arthur's, why not Mordred's queen?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mother she to Mordred! Wherefore spare,<br>  When he may smite with one avenging stroke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father's crime, and win a queen so fair?--<br>  A parricide?--Nay, but the sire first broke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of kind! Vengeance in kind were meet!<br>  Is she not Lancelot's love? She could revoke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her love for Arthur--were't not doubly sweet<br>  To reign Sir Lancelot's Lancelot, in her grace?--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the black pulses of the false heart beat.<br>  <br>  But other twain who gaze upon her face<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are sick with other fancies. Lancelot one--<br>  That other, Arthur--each a little space<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baring his sorrow to the May-day sun.<br>  O, but the look within Sir Lancelot's eyes!--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who of old hath diced with Death, and won<br>  The life he freely staked on his emprize,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever thereafter beareth in his look<br>  The mark of one who hath read mysteries:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here beside that sign as in a book<br>  Is writ the tragedy of love--such love<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As weaveth its own shame, yet cannot brook<br>  The eternal doom, to wear the weft it wove!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, and yet more! Look on his cheek again:--<br>  Along the furrows which his madness drove<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So deeply there, have tears not flowed in vain?<br>  Tears to which those of widows o'er the dead<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere nine days' bridal are as summer rain?<br>  But now those eyelids have no tears to shed!--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks upon the Dame who is his fate,<br>  Yet hath no worship for the white and red,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love-lustrous eyne and queenly grace of gait,<br>  And lips the world were once well lost to win.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never knew such passion as may sate<br>  Its yearnings and forget that it hath bin--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His was the love that, daring all things, dares<br>  Interminable sequences of sin--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dying, leaves its office to its heirs,<br>  Remorse and ruth and duty. Love, erewhile,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was lavish in observances and cares,<br>  And none are stinted.--Love, to earn a smile,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would spend its heart's blood on a hopeless quest:<br>  And, though the guerdon can no more beguile,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still woos death as freely to his breast,<br>  With every due devoir of champion knight.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, not the smallest point of love's behest<br>  In hall and bower but is fulfilled aright.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple is as stately as before:<br>  There is no change, no lacking to the sight--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only behind the Veil, where once of yore<br>  Within the Holy of Holies, in the Ark,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wings of Cherubs warded evermore,<br>  Love's own Shekinah dwelt, now burns a spark<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of liquid hell-fire! All else is the same--<br>  Even the light--but that which lights the dark<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer is the glory of The Name!<br>  <br>  There is no madness in the grief that ploughs<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of Arthur, but the searing flame<br>  Followed no less the share athwart his brows.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True king from crown to spur, within his eye<br>  Where royally 'mid high ambitions, house<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage's lore and the knight's chivalry,<br>  Lurk adders of inevitable sting.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis nothing that his time draws near to die:<br>  'Tis long since death hath seemed a dreadful thing,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he who did forebode it, told no less<br>  Of days when Arthur should again be king.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death simply were an end of weariness,<br>  Were't not he knoweth that it comes as doom<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sin unspeakable in youth's excess.<br>  Not yet he knoweth how nor when shall bloom<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That deadly seed he sowed within his life,<br>  Whose ripeness is the fruitage of the tomb;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet even now the shadows of the strife<br>  Fall on him from its leaves--and there be moods<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which he knows he hath no friend nor wife;<br>  And hinting doubts and treacherous likelihoods<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like night-mared children wake and cry aloud.<br>  Yet speaks he not the grief o'er which he broods:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will believe not. "Nay, she is too proud,<br>  Too pure, too loving! Never have I seen<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her true eyes the trouble and the cloud--<br>  No shame--no wish unworthy such a queen!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, Sir Lancelot--shall my weakness wrong<br>  Mine own knight peerless? Why, the time hath been<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, had he been less loyal-souled than strong,<br>  He might have won her when myself lay low,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the realm made glad his bridal song!<br>  Yea, had he been less true, it hath been so<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand times.--Yet, not as wronging them,<br>  But testing mine own conscience--say, I know<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twain are guilty--how shall I condemn?<br>  I, by the side of whose transcendent crime<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs were a mud-smirch on a kirtle-hem?<br>  Nay! I do wrong them! These my fancies chime<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too truly with that frenzy of mine youth!<br>  'Tis I, whose soul hath wallowed in the slime,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose thoughts pollute the cleanness of their truth!"<br>  Thus museth he--too sad, too pure to own<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to himself he knows the secret sooth!<br>  And Thou, fair Curse of Empire on his throne!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath that proud nostril known no penitence?<br>  O subtly double nature! each alone<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As true as truest music to the sense--<br>  Together both in discord intervals<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jangling a double falsehood and offence!<br>  Yea, false to Arthur and Lancelot false,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou'rt true to Lancelot and to Arthur true!<br>  Queen never queenlier stept in Camelot's halls,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leman more loving Joyous-Gard ne'er knew!<br>  Red as the life-blood, as the snowdrift white,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twin loves each from other wrests his due;<br>  And even as now the king's most royal right<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At knighthood's feet the imperious pulses fling,<br>  That empire's daughter, mated with the knight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had treasured her last fondness for the king!<br>  Thine is the star of even and of morn!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A childless Eve, thy loves for children bring<br>  Two offerings at two altars--blood and corn:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cain's garden-ransom of primeval sin<br>  And Abel's firstling of the flocks unshorn!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, even thus did Death at first begin,<br>  And thus begins our own! Nay, Death for her<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already hath made desolate all within,<br>  Yet left her beauty for its sepulchre.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream ye she knows not how she hath grown old,<br>  Or that the Mays in fleeting can confer<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peaceful pulses of a heart grown cold?<br>  Nay, the late summer of her years reveals<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secrets of passion which the spring ne'er told!<br>  Burns her with threefold thirst, yet, mocking, seals<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The springs of joy and leaves the witchcraft stale<br>  Could once have freed them! Think you not she feels<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little spout of hell-fire through the veil<br>  Within the temple of Sir Lancelot's love?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think you her eyes are seared not with the bale<br>  Of cloven flames her own twin arks above?<br>  <br>  Yea, Arthur's court is Arthur's court no more,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none have heart to strive as once they strove.<br>  All high emprize is crushed and crusted o'er<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ruin wrought by false and feeble wills,<br>  And the whole realm is smitten at the core<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With restless boding of supremer ills.<br>  <br>  So have we heard Sicilian palmer tell<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of quaking homesteads in the cloven hills,--<br>  Of muttered warnings in the Demon Dell<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreary levin flickering on the snow<br>  That crests the hollow heights of Mongibell.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While o'er the sulphurous cauldron gathering slow<br>  The swart reek waxeth like a cedar tree<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'ershadowing half the welkin; and below<br>  The whole isle groaneth--woodland, waste, and lea.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till on a starless night, with rending flash<br>  Of fury flaring into skies and sea,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far through the clouds the fiery fountains crash<br>  Of chaos spouted from abysmal wells:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the mountain-crucible a gash<br>  Of blinding brightness gapeth on the dells,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence forth in thundery ruin o'er the verge,<br>  Bursting the shattered gateways of the fells,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far through the pinewood swoops the smolten surge.<br>  The belted oaks a league before its tread<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shudder and writhe like slaves beneath the scourge,<br>  Ere long to die the death!--A ghastly red<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looms through the reek among their smouldering leaves,<br>  And, clogged with craggy dross, the fires of dread<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flood round the blazing trunks. The woodland heaves,<br>  And all the staggering mountain-side aflame<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slides to the plain among the ungarnered sheaves,<br>  Vineyard and thorp and city of old name.--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vainly inviolate all a summer's day<br>  The wall Cyclopian holds its ancient fame!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round scarp and bulwark, tower and buttress-stay<br>  Fathom on fathom, fiercelier swells and beats<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weltering fireflood with its stony spray!<br>  One rending yawn, and through the desert streets<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white walls float upon the deadly wave<br>  That whelms for aye those old imperial seats!--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thence, five-fold cloven, scarce with might to pave<br>  With fire the fig-tree shades and groves of palm,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grim flood loiters to its ocean-grave,<br>  And the old world resumeth its old calm:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though far o'er-sea, the Maltese anchorite<br>  Mid hail of ashes, stints his morning psalm<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Northward peers into the mist till night<br>  For the next sign of Judgment to begin.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fares our kingdom now, for Arthur's might<br>  Quakes to the base, fire-sapped by kingly sin:--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A footfall jarring scarce enough to shake<br>  One withered blossom from the jessamin<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than enough beneath our feet to wake<br>  The doom we wait for from its slumberings,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loose the fountains of the burning lake.<br>  <br>  The world is old--and still the mavis sings.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wait the doom--yet on the hawthorn-spray<br>  The nightingale remembers the old springs.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May-morn itself is weary of the May,<br>  Yet, careless of the wreck of realms and kings,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homeless cuckoo jeereth all the day.<br>
