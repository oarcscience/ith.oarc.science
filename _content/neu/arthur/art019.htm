The Favour and Approbation it met with, was much greater, and far more Universal, even among great Names, and establish'd, uncontested Judges, than I had ever the Vanity to expect.  Nor was I in the least surpriz'd or troubled, that it met with some Opposers.  For I must have been extreamly ignorant of the nature of Humane Passions, if I had not certainly foreseen, that not only the Design of the Poem, but likewise the </i> Provoking<i>  </i> Preface<i>  to it, must needs have engag'd a </i> Considerable<i>  </i> Party<i> , among whom were several Men of Wit and Parts, to use their utmost Endeavours to sink its Reputation; if indeed it should deserve any.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, when I consider'd that I was so great a stranger to the </i> Muses<i> , and by no means free of the </i> Poets Company<i> , having never Kiss'd their Governour's hands, nor made the least Court to the Committee that sits in </i> Convent<i>  </i> Garden;<i>  and that therefore mine was not so much as a </i> Permission Poem<i> , but a pure, </i> downright<i>  </i> Interloper<i> , it was but natural to conclude, that those </i> Gentlemen<i> , who by Assisting, Crying up, Excusing and Complementing one another, carry on their Poetical Trade in a Joynt-stock,  would certainly do what they could to sink and ruin an </i> unlicens'd<i>  </i> Adventurer<i> ; notwithstanding I disturb'd none of their Factorys, nor imported any Goods they had ever dealt in.  I knew that I ran a very great Risk while I was so hardy to venture abroad Naked and Unguarded, when none of the </i> Company<i>  went out without a notable </i> Convoy of Criticks<i>  and </i> Applauders<i> , who were constantly in their Service; Men tho' singly of no great Force, yet when united, considerable for their Numbers.  Accordingly when the Poem came forth they attack'd it, tho' perhaps not with all the Discretion, yet with all the Fury Imaginable; But all their Strokes were lost, and all their Efforts made in vain.  Impartial Readers, with great Generosity, protected the </i> strange<i>  </i> Muse<i>  from their rude Insults; and rescu'd her from their Noise and Violence.  For their Character and Temper, as well as the Grounds and Reasons of their Outcrys and Opposition were so well known, that they could by no means pass for unbyass'd and Disinterested Judges; and therefore all their Attempts either prov'd Unsuccessful, or produc'd a quite contrary Effect, and instead of lessening the Credit of the </i> Poem,<i>  in many Instances they very much advanc'd it.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These </i> Gentlemen<i>  pretend to be displeas'd with </i> Prince Arthur<i> , because they have discover'd so many Faults in it:  But there is good reason to believe they would have been more displeas'd, if they had discover'd fewer.  But they say, they have very nicely and carefully compar'd this </i> Poem<i>  with </i> Virgil<i> 's, and they find that famous </i> Roman<i>  has abundantly the advantage of </i> Prince Arthur<i> .  This they are Confident of, and are ready to maintain against all Mankind what I must confess, I never in the least doubted of.  But in the mean time, the making of that Comparison, and the very starting of the Debate, is a greater Honour done to the </i> Poem<i>  than could have been expected from the enemys of it.  But they seem to have given it yet a greater Reputation, inasmuch as they have not adventur'd to say or maintain, that either </i> Homer<i>  himself the Prince and Father of the </i> Epick<i>  </i> Poets<i> , or any of his Successors, </i> Virgil<i>  excepted, has shewn a more regular Conduct, or a more perfect Model, how much greater </i> Genius<i>  soever do's appear in their Writings.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all it must be acknowledg'd, that setting aside abundance of Frivolous, Frolicksom, and Groundless Objections which the Enemys of </i> Prince Arthur<i>  have made, that several considerable Defects are to be found in that </i> Poem<i> . I was conscious to my self, that the Second and Third Books were too long before I publish'd them, tho' they were not made before the First, as some have imagin'd, but hoping that they would not prove tedious to any impartial Readers, and that it might be an useful Entertainment to many, I was contented to let that </i> Indecorum<i>  pass.  And several Friends to </i> Prince Arthur<i>  did very early convince me, that in several Instances the Descriptions, Digressions, and Similes, were lyable to the same Objection.  I was likewise soon after the Publishing satisfy'd, that I had not well consider'd the Recital made by </i> Lucius<i>  in the Fourth Book; and particularly that it began too high; as likewise of many other Faults and Indecencies of less Importance.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis certain, that none could expect from me an </i> Epick Poem<i>  in all degrees of Perfection, there is no faultless Writer of that Kind, has ever appear'd in the World, not </i> Virgil<i>  himself excepted, tho' his Poem was a labour'd Piece, the Work of great part of his Life; and after revis'd by two Eminent Criticks </i> Tucca<i>  and </i> Varius.  <i> And as for the great </i> Homer<i> , if any Gentleman is pleas'd to read </i> Rapin<i> 's Comparison of him with </i> Virgil<i> , he will be soon convinc'd that the Poems of this Wonderful Man have many considerable Defects.  But the </i> Criticks<i> , and particularly the famous </i> Longinus<i>  have an Apology that will easily get him off:  They say of Writers of the first Rank, such as </i> Homer<i>  and </i> Demosthenes<i> , that one or two of their extraordinary and admirable Thoughts will Atone for all their Faults, and that a great Man is uncapable of attending with anxious Care to matters of little Importance.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if a sour, pragmatical </i> Critick<i>  would spend a Years time in searching after Objections to either of these Authours, he might perhaps find a great deal to say; but nothing that would lessen their Reputation.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faults in </i> Prince Arthur<i>  proceeded partly from defect of </i> Judgment<i>  and </i> Genius<i>  equal to, and sufficient for so great and difficult an Undertaking; partly from want of Leisure and Retirement, to consider coolly ever part of that Writing, and partly from the hasty Dispatch of it; it having been Begun, Carry'd on and Compleated, as in the Preface was Suggested, in less than two years time, and by such catches and starts, and in such occasional, uncertain hours, as the Business of my Profession would afford me.  And therefore for the greatest part that </i> Poem <i> was written in </i> Coffee-houses<i> , and in passing up and down the Streets; because I had little leisure elsewhere to apply to it.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason of the Defects that appear in that writing is this, That when I undertook it I had been long a stranger to the Muses.  I had read but little </i> Poetry<i>  throughout my whole Life, and in fifteen years before, I had not, as I can remember, wrote a hundred Lines in Verse, excepting a Copy of Latine Verses in honour of a Friend's Book.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this Apology will perhaps take off the severity of the Reader's Censure as to </i> Prince Arthur<i> , so I hope it may likewise have the same Effect, as to the following </i> Poem<i> ; for all the same things, except the last, can be said to excuse the Defects that shall appear in this.  And if it shall be demanded why it was so hastily publish'd, all that I shall say is this, that the Judicious Reader will soon find in the </i> Poem<i>  it self, the true Reason why I could keep it no longer by me; which if I could have done, it would, perhaps, have appear'd with more Advantages.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reasons which induc'd me to make the former, did likewise engage me in this second Attempt in </i> Epick<i>  Poetry; and among the rest, particularly this, that the young Gentlemen and Ladys who are delighted with Poetry might have a useful, at least a harmless Entertainment, which in our Modern Plays and Poems cannot ordinarily be found.  The Candor of the Age has made my Design in a great measure successful, whereby I am abundantly convinc'd that those Poets are under a great mistake, that think there is no other, but that leud and abominable way of writing which was encourag'd in the late Reigns, that will please the Nation.  This is a meer Pretence of ill Poets, whose Imaginations are fill'd only with base and contemptible </i> Ideas<i> ; Men of a poor and narrow </i> Genius<i> , scarce above the level of Writers of Farce, who would not have Images enough left in their Minds to furnish out a </i> Poem<i> , if the prophane and obscene ones were struck out.  And tho' these mischievous ways of Writing are still endur'd, to the great prejudice of Religion and good Manners, yet if ever the </i> English<i>  Nation recovers it's ancient Vertue, and a just Tast of these Matters, I do not doubt but most of those Writers who have been esteem'd and applauded in the late loose and vicious Times, will be rejected with Indignation and Contempt, as the Dishonour of the Muses, and the Underminers of the Publick Good.  But I am carry'd on to a Subject of which I have spoken enough heretofore.
<p>   
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the writing of this, I have seen a </i> Tragedy<i>  call'd the </i> Mourning Bride<i> ; which I think my self oblig'd to take notice of in this place.  This </i> Poem<i>  has receiv'd, and in my Opinion very justly, Universal Applause; being look'd on as the most perfect </i> Tragedy<i>  that has been wrote in this Age.  The </i> Fable<i> , as far as I can judge at first sight, is a very Artful and Masterly Contrivance.  The </i> Characters<i>  are well chosen, and well delineated.  That of </i> Zara<i>  is admirable.  The </i> Passions<i>  are well touch'd, and skillfully wrought up.  The </i> Diction<i>  is Proper, Clear, Beautiful, Noble, and diversify'd agreeably to the variety of the Subject.  Vice, as it ought to be, is punish'd, and Opprest Innocence at last Rewarded.  Nature appears very happily imitated, excepting one or two doubtful Instances, thro' the whole Piece, in all which there are no immodest Images or Expressions, no wild, unnatural Rants, but some few Exceptions being allow'd, all things are Chast, Just,  and Decent.  This </i> Tragedy<i> , as I said before, has mightily obtain'd; and that without the unnatural and foolish mixture of  </i> Farce <i> and</i>  Buffoonry, <i> without so much as a Song, or Dance to make it more agreeable.  By this it appears, that as a sufficient </i> Genius<i>  can recommend it self, and furnish out abundant matter of Pleasure and Admiration without the paultry helps above nam'd, so likewise that the Tast of the Nation is not so far deprav'd, but that a Regular and Chast Play will not only be forgiven, but highly Applauded.  And now there is some reason to hope that our </i> Poets<i>  will follow this excellent Example, and that hereafter no slovenly Writer will be so hardy as to offer to our Publick Audiences his obscene and prophane Pollutions, to the great Offence of all Persons of Vertue and good Sense.  The common pretence that the Audience will not be otherwise pleas'd, is now wholly remov'd; for here is a notorious Instance to the contrary.  And it must be look'd on hereafter as the </i> Poet's<i>  fault, and not the </i> People<i> 's, if we have not better Performances.  All men must now conclude that 'tis for want of Wit and Judgment to support them, that our </i> Poets<i>  for the Stage apply themselves to such low and unworthy ways to recommend their Writings; and therefore I cannot but conceive Great Hopes that every good </i> Genius<i>  for the fuutre will look on it self debas'd by condescending to Write in that leud Manner, that has been of late years introduc'd, and too long Encourag'd.  And if this comes to pass the Writers in the late Reigns will be asham'd of their own Works, and wish they had their </i> Plays<i>  in again, as well as their fulsome Dedications.
<p>   
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Persons have demanded the Reason, seeing I had a Fancy to be an Author, why I had not written on some useful Subject in Physic or Philosophy:  this they imagin'd would have became me better than the engaging my Thoughts on a Subject so far distant from the Business of my Profession.  I desire these Gentlemen to receive this answer; First, That the writing of this, as well as the former </i> Poem<i>  was not Business, but Diversion and Recreation; an Innocent Amusement to entertain me in such leisure hours which were usually past away before in Conversation, and unprofitable hearing and telling of News.  But if I had set my self to writing on matters of </i> Physic<i>  or </i> Philosophy<i> , this would not have been a </i> Recreation<i> , but another </i> Business <i> and </i> Labour<i> , for which I was unfit, and that requir'd the Liberty of my Books and Closet, and some sort of Retirement, which the Continual Dutys of my Profession would not allow me.  But I have also another Reason to give to the Persons who ask the Question above mention'd; and that is, that I am so far faln out with all Hyphotheses in </i>  Philosophy<i> , and all Doctrines of Physic which are built upon them, that in such matters I am almost reduc'd to a </i> Sceptical Despair<i> . The </i> Almighty<i> 's </i> Creation<i>  is like his </i> Providence<i> , unsearchable; </i> his<i>  </i> Works<i> , and </i> his<i>  </i> Ways<i>  are equally past finding out; the raising of an Hypotheses in Philosophy obtains little more Credit with me, that the erecting a Scheme in Astrology; and the Judgments and Decisions that are given upon them seem to me alike Precarious and uncertain.  I was once enamour'd with the </i> Cartesian System<i> , but the warmth of my Passion is quite extinguish'd.  It may indeed make a Man capable of entertaining and amusing others, but not of quieting and satisfying himself.  All Knowledge is valuable according to it's degree of Usefulness, as it do's more or less promote the benefit of Mankind, and for this Reason 'tis a great mortification to consider how little the Pains and Time I have bestow'd in Philosophical Enquirys, have contributed to my knowledge in Curing Diseases.  I am now inclin'd to think, that 'tis an Injury to a Man of good sense and natural Sagacity, to be hamper'd with any Hypothesis before he comes to the Practice of Physic.  For this prepossession obstructs the Freedom of his Judgement, puts a strong Byass on his Thoughts, and obliges him to make all the Observations that occur to him in his Practise, to comply with, and humour his pre-conceived Opinions; whereas in Reason, his Observations on Nature should be first made, before any Hypotheses should be establish'd.  A clear and penetrating Understanding, Cultivated and Matur'd by repeated, Diligent Observation, will in my Opinion, make a more able and accomplish'd Physitian, than any </i> Philosophical Scheme<i>  that has yet obtain'd in the World.  And what useful Knowledge, I have gain'd this way in my Profession, may perhaps sometime be made Publick.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look on my self to have greater obligations to the Studies of Logic and Metaphysicks, wherein I was carefully instructed in the University, which improve and advance our reasoning Faculty, teach us to think clearly and distinctly, to speak pertinently, closely, and justly; and thereby fit a Man for any kind of Business or Profession, than to all the Searches which I have made after the Reasons and Causes of </i> Natural Ph&aelig;nomena<i> .
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sensible, that these Studies are in great Contempt with many Ingenious Men; the subject of much Raillery, and the great Abomination of the </i> Wits<i> .  But I am likewise very sensible, that these merry Men very rarely become eminently useful in any sort of Profession; for the most part they continue Triflers all their Days; and a meer Jester, when he comes abroad into the World, makes a very mean Figure among Men of Business.  'Tis remarkable that those Idle, and almost illiterate Young Men, that are call'd </i> Wits<i>  in our Universities, are very inconsiderable Things elsewhere; for Mankind will never be perswaded to have those Men, who can only make them laugh, in equal Esteem with those that can do them Good.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus much in answer to those who have demanded, Why a Physician instead of communicating his Knowledge and Experience in his Profession, busys himself in Writing Heroic Poems.
<p>   
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the following Performance, tho' the </i> Hero<i>  be the same, yet 'tis another entire Poem, distinct from the former:  For 'tis the Diversity of the Action, and not of the </i> Hero<i> , that diversifies the Poem.  And that the Reader may better observe whence the Action of this takes its Rise, I will tell in short </i> King Arthur<i> '</i> s<i>  Story, as 'tis related by </i> Geofry <i> of </i> Monmouth<i> .  That there was about the end of the Fourth, or the beginning of the Fifth  </i> Century<i> , a King of </i> Britain<i>  nam'd </i> Arthur<i> ; a Prince of extraordinary Qualities, and Famous for his Martial Atchievements, who succeeeded his Father </i> Uter Pendragon<i> , all our Historians agree; and the eminently learned Bishop of </i> Worcester<i>  in his </i> Origines Britannic&aelig;,<i>  do's acknowledge it.  And tho' the above-cited </i> Geofry<i>  of </i> Monmouth<i>  is indeed a Fabulous Author, yet his Authority, especially considering that there was such a Warlike Prince as </i> Arthur<i> , is a sufficient Foundation for an </i> Epick Poem<i> .  This Author says, that after </i> King Arthur<i>  had Conquer'd the </i> Saxons<i> , who being call'd in by </i> Vortigern<i>  to protect him against the Incursions and Depredations of the </i> Scots<i>  and </i> Picts<i> , took the advantage, and settled themselves in this Island; he prepar'd a </i> Royal Navy<i> , Embark'd his </i> Troops<i> , and directed his Course to the Coasts of </i> Norway<i> ; then called, according to </i> Cluverius<i> , </i> Nerigon<i> , or the </i> Western Part<i>  of </i> Scandinavia<i> .  This Kingdom being subdued, he carried his Arms into the Country now call'd </i> Denmark<i> , then inhabited by the </i> Cimbri<i> : And by the Writers of the Age in which </i> Geofry<i>  of </i> Monmouth<i>  liv'd, call'd commonly, but erroneously, </i> Dacia<i> .  This Kingdom he likewise quickly overrun: For it seems nothing could stand before him.  This done, he return'd home in Triumph, and having for a while, entertain'd at his Court with great Splendor and Magnificence, multitudes of </i> Foreign Princes, <i> and Knights famous for Chivalry, who came to signalize their Valour at the </i> Justs <i>  and </i> Tournaments <i> which </i> King Arthur<i>  had proclaim'd; He Embark'd his Army to Invade</i>  Gallia<i> , sate down before </i> Lutetia<i> , once the Capital </i> City<i>  of the </i> Parisij<i> , and in </i> Arthur'<i> s days of the </i> Franci<i> , and soon made himself Master of the Place.  This Expedition, and the Conquest of </i> Lutetia<i> , is the Subject of the following </i> Poem<i> . 
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Model of it is New, and therfore now I hope I shall not be Censur'd for an </i> Imitator<i> , tho' I must confess, I cannot believe my Imitation of </i> Virgil <i> in the former </i> Poem <i> to be the least dishonour.  Would the famous Sir </i> Godfry Kneller<i>  think it a Reproach if any should say, that his Pencil too nearly follow'd that of </i> Raphael Urbin<i> ?  Or can it be imagin'd, that Sir </i> Christopher Wren<i>  would be offended, if it should be objected to him, that in his building of </i> St. Paul'<i> s </i> Church<i>  he too much imitated </i> Michael Angelo.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> And as I had not my Eye upon any other Model, so I am not conscious to my Self of having us'd any Authour's Thoughts or Expressions, excepting two or three Images taken from </i> Homer<i> , and a few allusions to some </i> Inventions <i> of </i> Milton, <i> whom I took on as a very Extraordinary </i> Genius<i> .  If there be any other Thoughts that are not my own, they are taken from the Sacred Writers of the Bible, which I hope I shall not be condemn'd for.  I have in the </i> Sixth Book<i>  adventur'd on an </i> Allegory<i> , finding </i> Homer<i>  has done the like in his Story of </i> Circe<i> .  His Example, I imagin, as well as the Nature and Design of </i> Epick Poetry<i>  will justify that Attempt, especially since I have not dwelt long upon it.
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the </i> Fable <i> of this </i> Poem<i>  be a </i> regular Contrivance<i> , whether there be but </i> One<i> , </i> Unbroken, Compleat Action, <i> whether the </i> Choice<i> , the </i> Conduct, Connexion, <i> and </i> Extension <i> of the </i> Episodes<i> , and whether the </i> Diction<i>  and </i> Narration <i> be such as the Rules of </i> Epick Poetry<i>  require, must be left to the Decision of the </i> Judicious Reader<i> .  It would be a wild Imagination to think of pleasing all the </i> Criticks<i>  who are no better agreed among themselves.  Till the Rules of Writing are Setled by some </i> Infallible Judge<i>  of </i> Controversys <i> among</i>  Poets, <i> there will be different</i>  Opinions<i>  and disagreeing </i> Sects<i>  in </i> Parnassus<i> , who will always treat and persecute one another as </i> Obstinate Hereticks<i> .  The </i> Essential<i>  and </i> Fundamental<i>  </i> Articles<i> , for want of which a </i> Poet<i>  is justly condemn'd, are very few.  There are Abundance of probable Doctrines which the </i> Schoolmen <i>  of </i>  Parnassus<i>  and the </i> Poets <i> in Speculation may hold affirmatively or negatively, as they please, and yet be look'd on as very </i> good Sons<i>  of the </i> Muses.  <i> If there appears enough in this </i> Poem<i>  to Entertain those </i> candid Readers<i>  who were not displeas'd with the </i> Former<i> , I shall be abundantly satisfy'd, and easily pass by the </i> Censures<i>  of those who are declared Enemys before hand.  The Ingenuous part of Mankind will not fall unmercifully on a </i>  Writer <i> of </i> Epick Poetry<i> , wherein only two Men, I mean </i> Homer<i>  and </i> Virgil<i>  have succeeded.  Whatever </i> Genius<i>  others have discover'd, none have left any Thing that came near to a perfect </i> Model, <i> but these two great Masters:  and I do not think it amiss in this place to make a Comparison between them, with which I shall end this </i> Preface.  
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homer <i> excels in </i> Genius<i> , </i> Virgil<i>  in </i> Judgment.  Homer<i>  as conscious of his great Riches and Fullness entertains the </i> Reader<i>  with great Splendor and Magnificent Profusion.  </i> Virgil<i> 's</i>  <i> Dishes are well chosen, and tho not Rich and Numerous, yet serv'd up in great Order and Decency.  </i> Homer<i> '</i> s<i>  Imagination is Strong, Vast and Boundless, an unexhausted </i> Treasure<i>  of all kinds of </i> Images;<i>  which made his </i> Admirers<i>  and </i> Commentators <i> in all Ages affirm, that all sorts of Learning were to be found in his </i> Poems.  Virgil's <i> Imagination</i>  <i> is not so Capacious, tho' his </i> Ideas <i> are Clear, Noble, and of great Conformity to their Objects.  </i> Homer<i>  has more of the </i> Poetical Inspiration<i> .  His Fire burns with extraordinary Heat and Vehemence, and often breaks out in Flashes, which Surprise, Dazle and Astonish the </i> Reader<i> : </i> Virgil'<i> s is a clearer and a chaster Flame, which pleases and delights, but never blazes in that extraordinary and surprising manner.  Methinks there is the same Difference between these two great </i> Poets<i> , as there is between their </i> Heros.  Homer'<i> s Hero, </i> Achilles<i> , is Vehement, Raging and Impetuous.  He is always on Fire, and transported with an immoderate and resistless Fury, performs every where </i> Miraculous<i>  </i> Atchievements<i> , and like a rapid Torrent overturns all things in his way.  </i> &AElig;neas,<i>  the Hero of the </i> Latine Poet<i> , is a calm, Sedate Warriour.  He do's not want Courage, neither has he any to spare:  and the </i> Poet<i>  might have allowed him a little more Fire, without overheating him.  As for Invention, 'tis evident the </i> Greek Poet<i>  has mightily the advantage.  Nothing is more Rich and Fertile than </i> Homer<i> '</i> s<i>  Fancy.  He is Full, Abundant, and Diffusive above all others.  </i> Virgil<i>  on the other hand is rather dry, than fruitful.  'Tis plain the </i> Latin Poet<i>  in all his famous </i> &AElig;neis, <i> has very little, if any Design of his own.  The Recital of the </i> Destruction <i> of </i> Troy<i> , and the Story of the </i> Wooden Horse, Macrobius<i>  says, is almost word for word taken from  </i> Pisander. <i>  The Navigation of </i> &AElig;neas; <i> and his Dangers and Adventures by </i> Sea<i> , are drawn from the example of </i> Homer's Ulysses.<i>   His Descent into Hell, which makes the Noble </i> Sixth Book<i> , is likewise in Imitation of the Hero before nam'd.  The Shield of </i> &AElig;neas <i> is form'd by that of </i> Achilles<i> .  The Battels in the </i> &AElig;neis<i>  very much resemble those in the </i> Ilias<i> .  A great many of the Pictures are taken from thence, and abundance of the Warriours are the same with those who fought before the Walls of </i> Troy<i> .
<p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tho 'tis true the Story of </i> &AElig;neas <i> and</i>  Dido<i>  is not to be trac'd in </i> Homer<i> 's </i> Works<i> , yet </i> Macrobius <i> tells us in his</i>  Saturnalia, <i> that this likewise is borrow'd from what is said of </i> Jason<i>  and </i> Medea<i>  in the </i> Fourth Book<i>  of </i> Apollonius<i>  his </i> Argonautica<i> .  Those who are willing to see how much </i> Virgil<i>  is indebted to </i> Homer<i> , and the rest of the </i> Greek Poets<i> , and also to the </i> Latins <i>  themselves, as </i> Ennius, Lucretius<i> , </i> Varius<i> , & c. from whom he has taken his Designs, or his particular Images; or whose very Lines he has Translated almost word for word, of  which an Incredible number of Instances may be given, may consult the before nam'd </i> Macrobius<i>  in his </i> Saturnalia, Fulvius Ursinus<i>  his </i> Comparatio Virgilij cum Scriptoribus Gr&aelig;cis & Guellius<i> , his </i> Comments<i>  on this great </i> Poet.  <i> They will then see plainly that </i> Virgil<i> '</i> s<i>  Materials were all borrow'd, tho' the Noble </i> Structure<i>  be his own.  The Excellency of this Extraordinary Man lay in his </i> Judicious Contrivance, Regular Conduct, <i> the </i>  Skilful Accomodation<i>  of other Mens Conceptions to his own Purpose, and in the </i> Propriety, Decency, Beauty <i> and</i>  Majesty <i> of his </i> Expression, <i> which in the finish'd Parts of his </i> Poem<i>  are </i> Admirable <i> and </i> Inimitable.  <i> If therefore the Question be, who had the greater </i> Genius, Homer<i>  or </i> Virgil<i> , there is no doubt but </i> Homer<i>  must be Prefer'd?  But if it be whether </i> Virgil'<i> s be a more Regular, Artful and Judicious </i> Poem <i> than either of </i> Homers, <i> then </i> Virgil<i>  must be acknowledg'd to have the advantage?<br>  </i>

 The strong Impression Sleep's soft Fetters broke,<br>  And from his Dream the <i> British</i>  King awoke:<br>  Who in his thoughts revolv'd what Heav'n should mean<br>  By this surprizing Visionary

So soft his Air, so graceful was his Port,<br>  As he had practis'd nothing but the Court:<br>  And yet so brave in Arms, and so much skill'd,<br>  As he had ne'er been absent from the Field.<br>  He spoke to all the high Concerns of State,<br>  As in the Council he had ever sate,<br>  And when amidst the Men that wore the Gown,<br>  The Schools admir'd, and thought him all their own.<br>  But his

the Powers of Hell.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, and strait th' enrag'd Arch-Traytor flys<br>  To Hell's Abyss, and leaves the Crystal Skys.<br>  As when an Eagle from a Mountain's head<br>  Surveys the flowry Vale around him spread,<br>  And sees a Snake along the Meadow play<br>  Enliven'd with the Spring's reviving Ray;<br>  The Eagle stoops down from the Mountain's top,<br>  And in a moment takes the Viper up:<br>  The twining Beast his crooked Pounces bear<br>  Wriggling and hissing swiftly thro' the Air.<br>  So swift a flight the wing'd Apostate made,<br>  And in a moment reach'd th' Infernal Shade.<br>  High on the gloomy Banks of <i> Lethe</i> 's flood<br>  The haughty Monarch's awful Palace stood;<br>  Built with Angelic Art and cost immense,<br>  With fearful Pomp, and vast Magnificence.<br>  The lofty Roof, amazing to behold,<br>  Was all of burnish'd, fine, <i> Tartarean</i>  Gold,<br>  Which dismal Glory did around display<br>  Thro' the Dun Air, and made a hideous Day.<br>  The high rais'd Pillars were of <i> Stygian</i>  Jet,<br>  Of <i> Doric</i>  Order in high Ranges set.<br>  The Walls were Marble, streak'd with bloody stains<br>  And Azure intermixt with Purple veins.<br>  Around thick Groves of shady Cypress grew,<br>  O'er which prodigious Bats, and croking Ravens flew.<br>  Poppys the Gardens bore, and Hollioaks,<br>  Henbane, and Nightshade and unwholsom Box.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither the summon'd Spirits did resort,<br>  And with their numbers fill'd their Prince's Court.<br>  Th' Assembly made a murm'ring hollow sound,<br>  Like that of Torrents rolling under ground;<br>  But all the busy Spirits, when they saw<br>  Their Monarch enter, with a silent Awe<br>  Attentive waited, he ascends his Throne,<br>  Which high erected o'er the Assembly shone.<br>  Then with a frowning Look yet haughty Air<br>  He thus began. High States of Hell, th' Affair<br>  Which now demands your Counsel, I'll declare.<br>  <i> Britannia</i> 's Monarch our Inveterate Foe,<br>  Who do's such hatred to our Empire show,<br>  Who has our Temples and our Groves laid wast,<br>  Destroy'd our Vot'rys and our Shrines defac'd,<br>  To storm <i> Lutetia</i>  has the Ocean crost<br>  And shakes our Altars with his impious Host.<br>  All means yet us'd his Progress to oppose<br>  Have fruitless been, the <i> Briton</i>  greater grows.<br>  He has eluded all our deep Designs<br>  And now in Arms before <i> Lutetia</i>  Shines.<br>  Against her Towers his Ensigns are display'd,<br>  And our fierce <i> Franks</i>  are of his Fame afraid.<br>  If by the <i> Briton</i>  this fair City's won,<br>  <i> Gallia</i>  farewell, that Realm from Hell is gone.<br>  There, we no more shall be as Gods ador'd,<br>  No praise return'd, no more our Aid implor'd.<br>  No Victims more shall at our Altars dye,<br>  No Vot'rys more before us prostrate lye.<br>  No more your Pamper'd Nostrils shall be fed<br>  With fatty steams from burning Entrails spred.<br>  No more you'll wanton in aspiring flames,<br>  Nor revel more in blood of Goats and Rams.<br>  In your high Groves you must no longer stay,<br>  Nor in sweet Clouds of rising Incense play.<br>  If <i> Gallia</i> 's lost, <i> Iberia</i>  may be too,<br>  <i> Ausonia</i>  next the Conqueror will subdue.<br>  If this Success attends th' Ambitious Foe,<br>  Illustrious Peers, say whither will you go?<br>  If to the Frozen or the Burning Zone,<br>  To Heats and Colds not much unlike your own.<br>  Or shall we always here despairing ly,<br>  Freeze on this Ice, or in these Burnings fry?<br>  Shall we take up with this Infernal Shade,<br>  Content no milder Regions to invade?<br>  Did we such wondrous Labour undergo,<br>  Such God-like Wit, and God-like Courage show,<br>  To win this Province from th' Almighty Foe;<br>  And shall we tamely yield the noble Spoil,<br>  And just Reward of all our ancient toil?<br>  Speak, Princes, how shall we <i> Lutetia</i>  Aid,<br>  Whether by Art or Power we shall invade<br>  The <i> British</i>  King; propound the likeliest way<br>  To check his Arms, and his swift Progress stay.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, and straightway <i> Belus</i>  rose, outdone<br>  In Fierceness, Pride and Insolence by none<br>  Of all th' Apostate Spirits, who combin'd<br>  To take up Arms against th' Eternal Mind:<br>  Who with th' Almighty for Dominion strove<br>  Troubling with Civil War the Realms above.<br>  Fir'd with excessive Rage he Silence broke,<br>  And thus th' attentive Senators bespoke.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prudent, Considering Spirits may destroy<br>  Those whom their Arts and subtile Wiles decoy:<br>  I hate your wise Expedients, I declare<br>  For generous Arms, and honourable War.<br>  Tricks amongst Angels must our fame debase,<br>  And stain the Glory of our Heav'nly Race.<br>  Our Mould's Divine, of pure Etherial Light,<br>  We the first Offspring of Eternal Might.<br>  An unextinguish'd flame dilates our Veins,<br>  And thro' our Limbs Immortal Vigour reigns.<br>  Shall such a Race to Shifts and Cunning fly,<br>  And not on Power, and matchless Strength rely?<br>  I scorn a sordid un-Angelic course,<br>  Unworthy of our Birth, and of our Force.<br>  In our first Wars what Courage did we show<br>  Shaking the Throne of our Almighty Foe?<br>  'Tis true we fell, but yet the glorious Field<br>  Do's greater fame than thousand Conquests yield<br>  Won from Created, Vulgar Enemys;<br>  Great was th' Attempt, and bold the Enterprise.<br>  Success we wanted, but the brave Design<br>  In Heav'n's and Hell's Records shall ever shine.<br>  And shall we think our Strength and Courage less,<br>  And by our Shifts our Impotence confess?<br>  That which perhaps may Cautious Spirits damp<br>  Is this, that drawn out round the <i> British</i>  Camp<br>  Of the Seraphic Guards a Party stands,<br>  Which <i> Michael</i>  our old Enemy Commands.<br>  We know this <i> Hallelujah</i>  singing Host,<br>  Who such Devotion and Religion boast:<br>  Who look on us, Curse on their Gracious Sect<br>  As Reprobates, with scorn and proud neglect.<br>  They would not with our Arms their Forces joyn,<br>  T' assert our Right, and gain our high Design.<br>  They would no Succours to our Army send,<br>  But still their tender Conscience did pretend.<br>  Yet Conscientions <i> Michael</i>  and the rest<br>  Who such abhorrence of our Cause exprest,<br>  Beneath the Veil of Sanctity and Zeal<br>  Falshood, Revenge, Malice and Pride conceal.<br>  On Heav'n with open Arms they will not fall,<br>  For this the timerous Saints Rebellion call.<br>  But oft I've heard their best Arch Angels Ly,<br>  I know their Fraud, and deep Hypocrisy.<br>  These Godly Seraphs let our Arms attack,<br>  And to their Praying Regions chase them back.<br>  To us their Numbers and their Strength are known,<br>  We know their Courage, and we know our own.<br>  Thro' Hells dark Realms let's sound the loud alarm,<br>  And give Command for all our Youth to Arm.<br>  Your Ensigns on the Dusky Plains display,<br>  And draw your Legions out in long Array:<br>  Legions that Life, and Strength Immortal feel,<br>  Arm'd all in Adamant and treble Steel.<br>  Let's empty all our Arsenals, and drain<br>  Our stores of Death, and Magazins of Pain.<br>  We'll draw out all th' Artillery of Hell,<br>  Artillery, like that by which we fell.<br>  We'll ride in flaming Tempests thro' the Air,<br>  And on the Foe discharge amazing War.<br>  Blue flames we'll carry from these Sulphurous Caves,<br>  And lave into the Air these boiling Waves.<br>  With this Tormenting Fire the Foe we'll burn,<br>  And against Heav'n, will Heav'n's own Vengeance turn!<br>  Up from their Roots these burning Hills we'll tear,<br>  And Hell's tremendous Spoils aloft we'll bear,<br>  And hurl our Racks and Tortures thro' the Air.<br>  With Storms of Fire, with Thunder, Rain and Hail,<br>  Mingled Destruction, we'll their Camp Assail.<br>  For our great Prince is Monarch of the Air,<br>  Our Empire still is uncontested there:<br>  Thus we th' Angelic Guards will soon remove,<br>  And send them to excuse themselves above.<br>  When they dismay'd back to their Seats are fled<br>  We'll o'er the <i> Britons</i>  dire Destruction spred.<br>  Thus we'll <i> Lutetia</i>  save, and Blood and Spoil<br>  Shall sooth our Torments, and our Pains beguile.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said. Then <i> Rimmon</i>  rose up from his Place,<br>  Of noble Stature, and Majestic Grace.<br>  In Eloquence and soft perswasive charms<br>  He much excell'd, but little car'd for Arms.<br>  No Seraph of a vaster Genius fell<br>  From the blest Regions to the Gulph of Hell.<br>  No Lord, that in th' Infernal Council sate<br>  Sustain'd with greater skill a high debate,<br>  Or seem'd more fit for Business of the State.<br>  None spoke with so much Ease, and such Address,<br>  None Business better knew, or lov'd it less.<br>  Dissolv'd in Luxury, in Sloth and Ease,<br>  He War declin'd, and pleaded still for Peace.<br>  No nobler Presence in the Court appear'd,<br>  None by the Senators was better heard.<br>  They knew his falshood, yet th' attentive throng<br>  Lov'd the soft Music of his charming Tongue.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who thus begun.  Immortal Potentates,<br>  Illustrious Princes, high Seraphic States!<br>  T' uphold this ancient Monarchy, a Zeal<br>  Greater than mine no Seraph can reveal.<br>  None to Obedience more Reluctance show,<br>  Or greater Hate to our Allmighty Foe.<br>  None more t' enlarge our Empire can desire,<br>  None feel more sensibly this painful Fire.<br>  Who more delights in a Terrestrial Seat,<br>  That from our Torment yields a mild restreat?<br>  Scorcht with corroding flame no Seraph loves<br>  More to frequent our cool refreshing Groves.<br>  Who's pleas'd with Incense more and od'rous Gums,<br>  Or the sweet Steams of burning Hecatombs?<br>  Therefore no likely means I would neglect<br>  To save our Altars, and our Priests protect.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  assisted with Celestial Aids<br>  Our Empire with resistless course invades.<br>  He his bold Cohorts round <i> Lutetia</i>  pouers,<br>  And threatens with his Arms her lofty Towers.<br>  A Guard of Seraphs round his Army stands,<br>  Celestial Sabres flaming in their hands.<br>  Now valiant <i> Belus</i>  wondrous Courage shows,<br>  Off'ring in Arms t'assault our potent Foes.<br>  I'm not for Arms by long experience taught;<br>  What have we gain'd by all our Battles fought?<br>  In Heavenly plains fir'd with a noble rage<br>  Our Troops did all the Allmighty's Host engage.<br>  Of which brave Deed what Seraph can Repent;<br>  But when our Strength and all our Arms were spent,<br>  You all remember <i> Michael</i> 's dreadful Sword,<br>  What fiery Darts we felt, what Thunder roar'd.<br>  As drunk with wrath divine our Army reel'd,<br>  And with Celestial Spoils o'erspread the Field,<br>  Seraph on Seraph heap'd, and Shield on Shield.<br>  Then did the Chariots which our Troops did chase,<br>  O'er faln Arch Angels Necks, and grov'ling Cherubs pass!<br>  Ignoble Rout deform'd th' Etherial Plain,<br>  When wounded Seraphs first had sense of Pain.<br>  Close on the Reer th' insulting Conq'rors hung,<br>  And with the pointed Lightnings which they flung.<br>  With massy Bolts and Darts of poison'd Steel,<br>  From which our Limbs did raging Anguish feel,<br>  Cross the steep Gulph they chas'd us till we fell<br>  To scape those Torments, down to these of Hell.<br>  This Fire, these Shades are all our Arms have won,<br>  The sad Reward that do's our labour crown.<br>  This Language is not to reproach our Flight,<br>  For who can stand against Eternal Might?<br>  But to diswade you from unequal Fight.<br>  Since first this famous War broke out in Heav'n,<br>  Since our fierce Troops from those mild seats were driv'n,<br>  We've oft with all our force the Foe assail'd,<br>  With wond'rous Brav'ry, yet we ne'er prevail'd;<br>  But Art has prosper'd, where our Arms have fail'd.<br>  We the Terrestrial World by Art did gain,<br>  And must by Art our Conquest still maintain.<br>  Well laid Temptations and enticing Charms,<br>  Which propagate our Guilt, are our successful Arms.<br>  Here lys our Strength, by these we must support<br>  The Power and Greatness of th' Infernal Court.<br>  We with our Heavn'ly Foes engage in vain,<br>  For those who know no Guilt, can feel no pain.<br>  Invulnerable they no hurt receive,<br>  Nor can they feel deep wounds, like those they give.<br>  But we can suffer, we can Torment feel,<br>  From wounds Inflicted by their glitt'ring steel.<br>  Our penetrable Plate and brittle Shield,<br>  Will to their keen Etherial Weapons yield.<br>  In these strange Flames by skill divine prepar'd,<br>  Our Mould grows tender, as our hearts grow hard.<br>  Such disadvantage justly may perswade,<br>  No more with force their Armys to invade.<br>  Let us known Arts and try'd Temptations use,<br>  That may from Heav'n the <i> Britons</i>  Minds seduce.<br>  If our Enticements take, we gain our Cause,<br>  For Heav'n from Rebels strait its Aid withdraws.<br>  Then you may Chase the <i> Briton</i>  to his Isle,<br>  And spread <i> Lutetia</i> 's Fields with Christian Spoil.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Milcom</i>  rose full of Revenge and Scorn<br>  A ghastly, meagre Fiend with Envy worn;<br>  His pale, lean Cheeks his restless Mind exprest;<br>  And Spite and Spleen his hollow Eyes possest.<br>  His wrinkled Forehead, sowr and sullen Brow<br>  Did deadly Hate, and deep Resentment show.<br>  He Seeds of Strife and sharp Contention sow'd,<br>  And call'd his Private Quarrel, Publick Good.<br>  With execrable Words and desperate Speech<br>  Th' Apostate still th' Allmighty did impeach.<br>  No ruin'd Angel so audacious seem'd,<br>  Or with so black a Tongue his God blasphem'd.<br>  Ev'n when in Heav'n blest with his Maker's Smile,<br>  The mocking Spirit would his Lord revile.<br>  Cast down from Heav'n he rav'd and curst the Blest<br>  Who still their Thrones and Innocence possest:<br>  Above the rest he show'd his Discontent,<br>  And more impatient seem'd of Punishment.<br>  None yet was found thro' all the Courts of Hell<br>  So Enterprizing, more Implacable.<br>  None of th' Apostate Host would sooner joyn<br>  To carry on a bold and black Design.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus he spoke. Lords of Celestial Race,<br>  Let not our Fears Seraphic Might disgrace.<br>  I'll to th' Allmighty ne'er be reconcil'd,<br>  Who of our Thrones our Birthright, us despoil'd;<br>  And in Exchange has made Arch-Angels take<br>  A low black Prison and a fiery Lake.<br>  I'd be reveng'd for this unrighteous Deed,<br>  And still attack him tho' I ne'er succeed.<br>  Whate'er, Seraphic Heros, be your Fate,<br>  Appear true Patriots of th' Infernal State.<br>  I would, as generous <i> Belus</i>  do's propose<br>  With Arms and Force invade our Godly Foes.<br>  I would, tho' they our Arms should still defeat,<br>  The noble War eternally repeat.<br>  I would alarm, assault, molest, annoy<br>  And still disturb the Foe, I can't destroy:<br>  For this an endless Pleasure would create,<br>  And with Revenge sooth our Immortal Hate.<br>  Why should we fly to Frauds, will Frauds obtain<br>  A Conquest which by Power we cannot gain?<br>  Do's not th' Eternal Foe as much excel<br>  In Wisdom, as in Strength the Peers of Hell?<br>  Will not his Circumspection undermine<br>  What you believe a deep and wise Design?<br>  Some have 'tis true succeeded by their Fraud,<br>  But I th' Ignoble Way could ne'er applaud.<br>  Let us, as <i> Belus</i>  urg'd for Arms declare,<br>  Our Forces Muster, and denounce the War.<br>  Our eager Troops will cheerfully obey;<br>  I'd be reveng'd, and War's the quickest way.<br>  I long the pious Squadrons to engage ---- <br>  More had he said, but wild and mad with Rage<br>  He to th' Assembly could no longer speek,<br>  But his Discourse did here abruptly break.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Ammon</i>  rose a Prince of high Renown,<br>  Awful in Flames, and haughty tho' undone.<br>  On his grave Brow deep Mysterys of State<br>  Prudence, Advice, and Contemplation sate.<br>  No Minister of all the <i> Stygian</i>  Court<br>  Declining Empires better could support.<br>  The State of Hell's affairs none better knew,<br>  None did their Int'rest with more Zeal pursue.<br>  Important Looks and solemn Air confest<br>  Labour and vast Concern within his Breast.<br>  The Fate of Kingdoms seem'd his anxious Care,<br>  Ruptures of Peace, and high Designs of War.<br>  He seem'd engag'd in searching proper ways<br>  To prop old Monarchys, or new ones raise.<br>  When he began, all great attention paid,<br>  And silent sate and husht, as midnight shade.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thus he spake. Spirits of Race divine<br>  What <i> Belus</i>  offer'd, tho' a brave Design,<br>  Suits not with <i> Rimmon</i> 's Judgment, nor with mine.<br>  Should we by gen'ral Vote for Arms declare<br>  And Heav'n once more invade with open War,<br>  If we the Conqu'rour should again incense,<br>  What can we hope from arm'd Omnipotence,<br>  But greater Wrath, and Torments more intense?<br>  Can't he fresh Treasures open that contain<br>  Yet fiercer Vengeance, more destructive pain?<br>  His secret stores yet deadlier Light'nings yield,<br>  More massy Bolts his vengeful Arm can weild.<br>  In his high Arsenals will yet be found<br>  Much keener Arms, and Darts that deeper wound;<br>  Where he preserves his chosen Torments wrought<br>  With greater Labour, greater Skill and Thought.<br>  Where Swords of hardest Heav'nly Metal made,<br>  And Shafts in strongest Fury dipt are laid.<br>  Cannot th' Almighty Conquerour if he please,<br>  From Hell's deep Vaults more dreadful Plagues release,<br>  And with new Racks our Tort'ring pains increase?<br>  Can't he these fiery Mountains on us turn,<br>  Enrage our flames, and make them fiercer burn?<br>  Or may we not in Hills of Ice immur'd,<br>  Feel sharper Cold, than e'er we yet endur'd?<br>  May not his hand bar fast the Gates of Hell,<br>  Confine us to Despair, and make us dwell<br>  Close Pris'ners chain'd in these Sulphureous Caves,<br>  Or overwhelm us with these boiling Waves;<br>  That we no more may our sad hours beguile,<br>  In the soft Air of the Terrestrial Isle:<br>  Nor our fry'd Limbs repose by shady Trees,<br>  Nor fan our Burnings with a gentle Breeze.<br>  Our open force must meet this dismal end,<br>  And these sad Triumphs must our Arms attend.<br>  But of <i> Lutetia</i>  why should we despair,<br>  And of our <i> Franks</i>  so much renown'd in War?<br>  Great <i> Clotar</i>  do's in Wiles and Arts excel,<br>  That scarce inferiour are to those of Hell,<br>  By Force or Fraud the <i> Briton</i>  he'll repel.<br>  A numerous Army he together draws,<br>  Resolv'd t' assert ours, and the <i> Gallic</i>  Cause.<br>  But grant that high <i> Lutetia</i>  should submit,<br>  And the proud Conqu'ror on her Throne should sit.<br>  Grant all the Towns and Provinces of <i> Gaul</i>  <br>  Should yield, and follow great <i> Lutetia</i> 's fall:<br>  Must all our other Votarys Rebel,<br>  And take up Arms against the Power of Hell?<br>  Mankind Obedience hate, as well as we,<br>  In Guile and Temper we so much agree,<br>  A great Defection from us cannot be.<br>  <i> Rome</i>  ever faithful to our Cause appear'd,<br>  To us by constant Services endear'd.<br>  Her strong Affection all her Deeds proclaim;<br>  Her Aims and Interests are with ours the same.<br>  Besides, <i> Iberia</i>  is a faithful Friend,<br>  And will her Troops to our Assistance send.<br>  But what if all th' <i> European</i>  Realms were gone,<br>  <i> Asia</i>  may still her fixt Obedience own.<br>  There we with Incense may our Nostrils cloy<br>  And all the pleasures of the East enjoy.<br>  There we may sport in mild, indulgent Beams,<br>  And cool our Sores in sweet refreshing Streams.<br>  There we may wander o'er a flowry Land,<br>  And see in Spicy Groves our Altars stand.<br>  Then add to this that our Imperial Sway<br>  The Black and Tawny Nations all obey;<br>  Who lie extended o'er the spacious Soil<br>  From famous <i> Memphis</i>  to the head of <i> Nile</i> .<br>  From th' <i> Ethiopean</i>  Region to the Shore<br>  On which th' <i> Atlantic</i>  Ocean's Billows roar;<br>  And from the Northern to the Southern Moor.<br>  Besides a Western World is still our own,<br>  Where <i> Arthur</i>  and his God are yet unknown.<br>  This undiscover'd Soil, this Golden Coast<br>  Serves as a Refuge to receive our Host,<br>  Were all the Eastern World to <i> Arthur</i>  lost.<br>  These are the Reasons which with me prevail,<br>  Not with our Arms the <i> Briton</i>  to Assail.<br>  I would from Hell the Fury discord send,<br>  That her swift flight might to <i> Britannia</i>  bend.<br>  Since <i> Arthur</i> 's absent, she may soon embroil<br>  The wav'ring State, and trouble all the Isle.<br>  She midst the <i> Britons</i>  may Dissention sow,<br>  And into noble flames may quickly blow<br>  The Seeds of Strife that in their Bosoms glow.<br>  She'll all the Fuel find she can require<br>  To feed and entertain her raging fire.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  who chas'd us from the <i> British</i>  Coast,<br>  And to pursue us has the Ocean crost,<br>  Quitting his high Design, must then be gone,<br>  And leave this Kingdom to Secure his own.<br>  He said. The Synod gave a loud Applause,<br>  And with this Counsel pleas'd, their Monarch rose.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time the <i> Gallic</i>  Monarch took th' alarm,<br>  And gave Command for all his Men to Arm.<br>  Resolv'd to stop th' Invading <i> Briton</i> 's rage,<br>  And in the Field his Army to engage.<br>  <i> Lutetia</i>  first the Cry of Arms began,<br>  Which soon thro' <i> Clotar</i> 's wide Dominions ran.<br>  The zealous Leaders did their Troops Collect,<br>  To form an Host their Kingdom to protect.<br>  With wondrous speed they did together draw<br>  Their Squadrons, which did distant Citys aw.<br>  The Valiant Lords from various Regions came,<br>  To save their Country, and to raise their Fame.<br>  The Pagan Priests wild with the dismal Fright,<br>  With their loud Crys did all to Arms excite;<br>  Who for their Altars might their Lives expose,<br>  And guard their helpless Gods from Christian Foes.<br>  Thro' every Town the <i> Franks</i>  in Arms appear'd,<br>  In every Street the Voice of War was heard.<br>  Loud Clamors, and the Soldiers mingled Crys<br>  Shook all the Azure Arches of the Skys.<br>  Some on their Coursers mounted did advance,<br>  Arm'd with a Shield, a Sword, and glitt'ring Launce,<br>  Some came on Foot and for their Arms did bear<br>  A dreadful Halbert, and a Massy Spear.<br>  They came from every Soil and every Town<br>  Which did the haughty <i> Franks</i>  Dominion own.<br>  Round high <i> Lutetia</i> 's Walls to stop the Foe<br>  Their Confluent Troops did in a Deluge flow.<br>  All were compleatly arm'd, and here my Verse<br>  The Names of those fam'd Heros shall rehearse,<br>  Who had in <i> Clotar</i> 's Army high Command,<br>  And the great <i> Briton</i> 's Triumphs did withstand:<br>  It shall the warlike Nations too relate,<br>  Who joyn'd their Arms to Guard the <i> Gallic</i>  State.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i> Gaston</i>  for Conduct Strength and Martial Flame<br>  Among

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i> Arbel</i>  was of his ancient noble Blood,<br>  Of his Successes, and high Station proud:<br>  Vast was his Bulk, prodigious was his Strength,<br>  Pondrous his Spear, and of

Envy hear,<br>  And thought his Name was to the <i> Gauls</i>  too dear.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great <i> Oromel</i>  of Princely Parents born,<br>  Whose Deeds his Line and Country did adorn,<br>  Came with his Troops from the high Mountain's side<br>  Which do's <i> Iberia</i>  from the <i> Gaul</i>  divide.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i> Bofar,</i>  to Honour by his Valour

to enslave.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <i> Moloc</i>  was next, a Captain fierce and bold,<br>  Known for his Thirst of Blood, and Love of Gold.<br>  This Man was one who with his Sword pursu'd<br>  The Christians, and his hands in Blood embrued.<br>  Some he destroy'd with ling'ring Torments, some<br>  To shun his barb'rous Outrage left their home;<br>  And thro' the Woods and Hills

<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First his impetuous Dart <i> Olcanor</i>  cast<br>  Which thro' <i> Comara</i> 's shining Buckler past:<br>  Then thro' his temper'd Breastplate made its Way,<br>  And buried deep within his Bosom lay.<br>  From the wide Wound warm crimson Streams of Blood<br>  Sprang out, and down the <i> Briton</i> 's Armour flow'd:<br>  Backwards he fell of Sense and Breath bereft,<br>  And his hot Steed without a Rider left.<br>  The generous Courser now without a Guide,<br>  Did with the spacious Breast the Flood divide,<br>  And climbing up the Banks with loosen'd Reins,<br>  Flew wild about, and scowr'd along the Plains.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then mighty <i> Stuffa</i>  threw his massy Spear,<br>  Which with its Errand pleas'd, sung thro' the Air.<br>  He aim'd it full at <i> Goran</i> 's shining Crest,<br>  But missing him, it struck his Courser's breast.<br>  A Crimson Torrent spouted from the Wound,<br>  And deeply tinctur'd all the Flood around.<br>  The Steed tho' tortur'd with the goring Spear,<br>  Would fain the Warriour thro' the Water bear.<br>  He heav'd his lab'ring Limbs, stretcht every Vein,<br>  Did every Muscle, every Sinew strain;<br>  His Mouth out-foam'd the Waves, his Eye balls star'd,<br>  And working Nostrils Death at hand declar'd:<br>  Then faint with toil and vast expence of blood,<br>  He with his Rider sunk beneath the Flood.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then was at <i> Belon</i> 's head a pondrous Stone<br>  By the strong Arm of raging <i> Bofar</i>  thrown.<br>  It lighted on the <i> Briton</i> 's Breast, beneath<br>  The Paps, and from his Body struck his breath.<br>  He straightway headlong fell, and <i> Esia</i> 's Wave<br>  Involv'd the <i> Briton</i>  in a liquid Grave. <br>  Next <i> Robar</i>  fell of <i> Berta</i> 's noble Line,<br>  Too bold the greatest Dangers to decline:<br>  Now an inglorious Spear at random cast,<br>  His Naval pierc'd, and thro' his Bowels past.<br>  He honour'd by his Birth <i> Sabrina</i> 's Stream,<br>  And by his Death rais'd silver <i> Esia</i> 's fame.<br>  Here <i> Dolan</i>  to surmount the rising Banks,<br>  Stuck fast his Spurs within his Courser's Flanks;<br>  The Steed against the Bank with fury sprung<br>  That high above the Water's Margin hung;<br>  But fell down backward headlong to the Flood,<br>  And lab'ring lay, and choaking in the Mud.<br>  Then <i> Arton,</i>  <i> Gamal</i> , and <i> Ormellan</i>  dy'd,<br>  And with their Bodys swell'd the troubled tyde.<br>  Next <i> Blanadoc</i>  for Arts and Courage known,<br>  And <i> Holan,</i>  wise <i> Testador</i> 's Valiant Son,<br>  And many more amidst the Waves were slain,<br>  Who strove to make the Shore, but strove in vain.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time their Friends had gain'd the adverse Banks,<br>  And march'd in Battle rang'd against the <i> Franks</i> .<br>  Near to the Hills, the <i> Franks</i>  retreating back,<br>  In order drawn, waited the Foe's Attack.<br>  Then Valiant <i> Arthur</i>  to his <i> Britons</i>  cry'd,<br>  Now, Fellow Soldiers, no remaining Tyde<br>  Is left to Guard the Foe; here, <i> Britons,</i>  see<br>  The way is plain that leads to Victory.<br>  He said. And straight he spur'd his fiery Steed,<br>  And thunder'd thro' the Plain with eager speed.<br>  As when a Falcon from the Airy brow<br>  Of some high Hill descrys the Game below,<br>  To truss the Prey so strong, so swift he flys,<br>  As if some Engine shot him thro' the Skys.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i>  with a noble Ardor past<br>  T' engage the Foe, and the first Spear he cast<br>  To Death's unwelcome Shades stout <i> Hago</i>  sent;<br>  The fatal Weapon thro' his Buckler went,<br>  Broke thro' his Armour oft in Battle try'd,<br>  And pass'd his Body thro' from Side to Side.<br>  At <i> Corolan</i>  he aim'd his second Spear,<br>  Which pierc'd his Head ent'ring above the Ear!<br>  He fell, and groveling in his flowing Gore<br>  Fetch'd one deep Groan, and after fetch'd no more.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from amidst the Files <i> Grimaldo</i>  sprung,<br>  Nobly descended, vig'rous, bold and young:<br>  With all his Might his furious Spear he threw,<br>  Which from the <i> Briton</i> 's Shield in pieces flew.<br>  The Monarch all enrag'd with mighty Force<br>  His Javelin cast, which with impetuous Course<br>  Into his Breast past thro' his massy Shield;<br>  Faint with the fatal Wound a while he reel'd,<br>  Then down he fell, and stretcht upon the Ground<br>  Which with his ringing Armour did resound.<br>  Then <i> Boson</i>  stept out from the foremost Ranks<br>  A noble Youth born on <i> Axona</i> 's Banks;<br>  He rais'd his spacious Buckler in the Air<br>  And stooping down guarded his Head with Care.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  saw him, and a Javelin sent<br>  Which might all farther Care of Life prevent:<br>  But <i> Boson</i>  seap'd, tho with a mighty Dread<br>  He heard the erring Death sing o'er his Head.<br>  <i> Conrade</i>  who next did to the Charge advance<br>  Could not escape with such a prosp'rous Chance.<br>  An Ashen Spear the <i> British</i>  Monarch sent<br>  Which on its deadly Message swiftly went.<br>  The furious Weapon did with Ease divide<br>  His Buckler's temper'd Plate and treble Hide.<br>  Then deep within his wounded Breast it sunk,<br>  And at their purple Spring his Vitals drunk.<br>  Strait on the Ground he fell no more to rise,<br>  And everlasting Sleep o'erwhelm'd his Eyes.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did <i> Amintor</i>  and great <i> Tursin</i>  feel<br>  Deep in their wounded Veins the <i> Briton</i> 's Steel.<br>  Next <i> Raban</i>  and <i> Amansul</i>  near ally'd<br>  By the same mighty Arm together dy'd:<br>  These did when living to each other show<br>  The highest Strains of mutual Love, and now<br>  When dying both their Friendly Streams of Blood<br>  Were joyn'd, and mixt in warm Embraces flow'd.<br>  Then <i> Villa</i>  much admir'd for beauteous Charms,<br>  And not less famous for his splendid Arms,<br>  Who with applauded Brav'ry always fought,<br>  Up to the Charge his fierce Battalions brought.<br>  Then did the valiant <i> Frank</i>  his Javelin throw<br>  Aiming at <i> Arthur</i> 's Breast a furious Blow:<br>  Thro' the soft Bosom of the Air it went,<br>  And in the <i> Briton</i> 's Shield its Fury spent.<br>  The King enrag'd strait cast his glitt'ring Dart<br>  Which thro' his Shield and Breast transfixt his Heart:<br>  The noble <i> Frank</i>  in strong Convulsions lay,<br>  Wallowing in Gore, and Gasping Life away:<br>  His swimming Eyes grew dim, and suddain Night<br>  Her sable Curtain drew before his Sight.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the <i> Franks</i>  with vengeful Fury warm'd,<br>  In numerous Throngs about the Monarch swarm'd.<br>  Bright Showers of Darts did on his Buckler ring,<br>  And bearded Arrows all around him sing.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  enrag'd, resolv'd to force the Foe,<br>  To break their Ranks, and cut his Passage thro.<br>  He now no longer missive Weapons threw,<br>  But from his Side broad Caliburno drew.<br>  Above his Head he wav'd the glorious Blade,<br>  Which dreadful Flashes thro' the Air convey'd.<br>  And then advancing with a mighty stride,<br>  Did force his Passage, and the Files divide.<br>  As when a River is oblig'd to stay,<br>  Oppos'd by some new Mound that dams its Way:<br>  Th' obstructed Tyde swoln with its Fury stands,<br>  And to its Aid calls its wat'ry Bands.<br>  Recruited thus the River leans, and heaves,<br>  And shoves against the Bank with all its Waves:<br>  Which having broken, with resistless Force<br>  It roars along, and runs with swifter Course.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i> 's Rage resisted higher rose,<br>  And scatt'ring all who did his Arms oppose<br>  He thro' their Ranks with double Fury flew,<br>  And their <i> Brigades</i>  with greater Havock slew,<br>  Such was the Conq'rour's rapid Course, that Fate<br>  Could scarce attend, and almost came too late.<br>  While Vict'ry almost spent, and out of Wind<br>  Flew heavily along, and panting lag'd behind.<br>  <i> Ansegius</i>  when he saw the Monarch nigh,<br>  Shaking with Pannic Fear began to fly.<br>  The <i> British</i>  King pursu'd him o'er the Sand,<br>  His mighty Sword uplifted in his Hand.<br>  The flying <i> Frank</i>  finding his Vigor spent,<br>  And that his Flight could not his Fate prevent,<br>  Turn'd back, and trembling on the Ground he kneel'd,<br>  And threw upon the Sand his Sword and Shield:<br>  Then while his Hands he spread out in the Air,<br>  And did his Words to beg his Life prepare,<br>  His Head flew mut'ring from his sever'd Neck,<br>  And in the Dust seem'd eager still to speak.<br>  So when the timerous Game from far descrys<br>  Th' invading Falcon stooping from the Skys,<br>  Upon the Prey so swift is his Descent,<br>  It do's its Crys and almost Fears prevent.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Huban</i>  glorying in his noble Blood,<br>  Boldly the conqu'ring <i> Briton</i> 's Course withstood.<br>  But strait the Warriour on his Crest did feel<br>  The Weight and Force of <i> Arthur</i> 's massy Steel;<br>  With the vast Blow of the broad Fauchion stun'd<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  fell down, and prest the trembling Ground.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  advanc'd and thus the <i> Frank</i>  bespoke<br>  Before his Arm discharg'd a second Stroke.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Huban,</i>  what Widows Plaints, what woful Crys<br>  Of Orphans made by thee, have fill'd the Skys?<br>  Thou unprovok'd, with Fire and Sword hast past<br>  Thro' Peaceful States, and laid rich Countrys wast.<br>  What pop'lous Towns and Citys hast thou burn'd,<br>  What Towers and Domes to heaps of Rubbish turn'd?<br>  How has thy Sword thy Neighbours round alarm'd,<br>  And slain their Youth when naked and unarm'd?<br>  This Cruelty thy bloody hand has shown<br>  To please King <i> Clotar</i> 's Fury, and thy own.<br>  I'll now extinguish thy unnatural Thirst<br>  Of humane Blood; That said, the Monarch thrust<br>  Deep in his panting Breast his mighty Sword,<br>  And left upon the Ground th' extended Lord.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Obal,</i>  <i> Rodan</i> , and <i> Gutaro</i>  fell,<br>  And <i> Oroman</i>  who did in Arts excel.<br>  <i> Ocar</i>  and <i> Nisan</i>  lay in Dust and Gore,<br>  And great <i> Alcador,</i>  and vast numbers more<br>  Whose Vulgar Names appear in no Record,<br>  Dy'd by the mighty <i> Briton</i> 's Conq'ring Sword.<br>  As when a Craggy Rock, that did appear<br>  Still falling while suspended in the Air,<br>  By washing Showers and frequent Tempests worn,<br>  Or by some inward strong Convulsion torn,<br>  Breaks off, and falling from the Mountain's top,<br>  Rolls down the Wood beneath without a stop;<br>  It overturns the Forest in it's way,<br>  Nor can the strongest Oaks it's Progress stay.<br>  Elms rooted up and broken Pines around,<br>  (Amazing Desolation) spread the ground.<br>  The <i> British</i>  King advanc'd with such a force,<br>  And no less Spoils adorn'd his rapid course.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time King <i> Clotar</i>  who in Armour shone<br>  Of polish'd Plate, led his Battalions on.<br>  Around his Head his crested Helm was lac'd,<br>  And on his Arm his blazing Target brac'd;<br>  Which o'er the Field, amazing to behold,<br>  Shone like a glowing Orb of melted Gold.<br>  Fir'd with excessive Rage he did advance,<br>  And shook from far his formidable Lance.<br>  Then mounted in his high Refulgent Car,<br>  He plung'd with loosen'd Reins amidst the War.<br>  Brave <i> Gisan</i>  first did in his Bosom feel<br>  The deadly force of his projected Steel:<br>  Down to the ground the wounded Warriour came,<br>  And by his fall advancd the Conq'rour's fame.<br>  Another Spear at <i> Roderic</i>  he threw,<br>  Which thro' his Shield, his Head, and Helmet flew.<br>  The noble <i> Briton</i>  stretcht upon the ground<br>  And felt departing Life Ebb from his Wound:<br>  He gather'd up his quiv'ring knees, and strait<br>  He stretcht them out, and yielded to his fate.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bold <i> Gotric</i>  next did in the Front appear,<br>  Resolv'd to stand the mark of <i> Clotar</i> 's Spear:<br>  With mighty Vigor he his Weapon cast;<br>  It flew, and hiss'd with fury as it past.<br>  It struck the Shield, but by unhappy chance<br>  Did from the brazen Brim obliquely glance.<br>  But that his Message might not be in vain,<br>  By its refracted stroke was <i> Ruthen</i>  slain,<br>  And lay extended on the dusty Plain.<br>  Where <i> Clotar</i>  stood <i> Ruthen</i>  was always near,<br>  No Courtier more was to his Master dear.<br>  With him the Monarch did the Secrets trust<br>  Both of his Cruelty, and of his Lust.<br>  The noblest <i> Franks</i>  did by his Ponyard bleed,<br>  Whose Doom by <i> Clotar</i>  had been first decreed.<br>  Or he the poison'd Bowl bore in his hand,<br>  If bloodless Death his Master did command.<br>  The fairest Women to his Bed he brought,<br>  By Force, or Fraud, or by his Silver bought.<br>  By <i> Ruthen</i> 's fall King <i> Clotar</i>  all enrag'd,<br>  His utmost strength in deep Revenge engag'd.<br>  With his extended Arm his Dart he cast,<br>  Which as a Bolt of Thunder swiftly past.<br>  On <i> Gotric</i> 's Shield the hissing Vengeance fell,<br>  Nor could the temper'd Steel its force repel.<br>  Thro' Plates and Plys and Hides it's way it made,<br>  And in his brawny Thigh the Weapon staid.<br>  The Bearded Plague stuck in his wounded Veins,<br>  And rack'd the Hero with tormenting Pains.<br>  Down on his Knees he fell as in a Trance,<br>  The haughty Victor fiercely did advance<br>  To strike his head off, when brave <i> Cutar</i>  broke<br>  Thro' the thick Files, to ward the furious Stroke: <br>  He took the Monarch's blow upon his Shield;<br>  A suddain shout rung thro' th' applauding Field.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Cutar,</i>  <i> Clotar</i> 's progress to arrest,<br>  Discharg'd a noble Blow against his Crest;<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  receiv'd it on his temper'd Shield,<br>  But stagger'd with the stroke, and backward reel'd.<br>  Mean time brave <i> Gotric</i>  had new Spirits gain'd,<br>  Reviving from his Swoon, and then sustain'd<br>  Both by his faithful Friends and

Prescrib'd a nobler Balm to heal the Wound<br>  Then that the famous <i> Locatella</i>  found.<br>  King <i> Clotar</i>  soon recover'd, and for Fight<br>  Collected all his Rage, and all his Might.<br>  As when a Lyon roaming o'er the Plains<br>  Is stop'd by Huntsmen, and surrounding Swains,<br>  If wounded once by some advent'rous Spear,<br>  He sees his blood upon the Ground appear,<br>  Straight double fury gathers in his Eyes,<br>  And on the Foe with double force he flys.<br>  So with a fiercer Fire the Monarch burn'd,<br>  And to the War with greater Rage return'd.<br>  Then with his mighty Spear he did Assail<br>  His valiant Foe; nor Shield, nor Coat of Mail<br>  Nor harden'd Cuirass could its fury stay,<br>  Till glancing on the Ribs it flew away.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  felt the Wound within his Side,<br>  And all his Limbs the streaming Purple dy'd.<br>  The noble Leader rag'd at this Defeat,<br>  But Loss of Blood oblig'd him to retreat.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next valiant <i> Horan</i>  did the <i> Frank</i>  engage,<br>  Fam'd for his Arms and splendid Equipage:<br>  He from the flowry Banks of <i> Isis</i>  came,<br>  To win in <i> Gallic</i>  Fields heroic Fame.<br>  But in those Fields the Combatant was slain<br>  Unable <i> Clotar</i> 's Fury to sustain.<br>  Then Valiant <i> Malgo</i>  shook his pondrous Lance,<br>  And bad his bold <i> Dimetian</i>  Troops advance.<br>  He bravely march'd the foremost of the Band,<br>  And charging boldly made a noble Stand.<br>  As when the Rocky Fragments standing up<br>  In a rude Channel oft the Torrent stop<br>  Which during Summer from dissolving Snows<br>  Down the rough Sides of some high Mountain flows.<br>  Obstructed thus the foaming Deluge raves<br>  And roars against the Rocks with all its Waves.<br>  So did the <i> Britons</i>  <i> Clotar</i> 's Course oppose,<br>  And in his boyling Veins like Fury rose.<br>  With high Applause great <i> Malgo</i>  kept his Ground,<br>  Till feeling in his Head a painful Wound<br>  Inflicted by a Dart which <i> Clotar</i>  cast,<br>  His Friends compell'd him to retire at last.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did the <i> Frank</i>  with Sword in Hand invade<br>  The <i> British</i>  Ranks, and vast Destruction made.<br>  Now grisly Death with Crimson Garlands crown'd,<br>  In horrid Triumph reign'd, while all the Ground<br>  With Helmets, Shields and broken Spears was spread,<br>  With ghastly Spoils, and slaughter'd Heaps of Dead.<br>  When famous <i> Shobar</i>  with his watchful Eye<br>  Perceiv'd the <i> British</i>  Troops begin to ply,<br>  Highly enrag'd, he call'd aloud to those<br>  Who did his own select Brigade compose,<br>  See, where your Countrymen begin to yield,<br>  And fearing <i> Clotar</i> 's Arms forsake the Field.<br>  Let us advance our Ensigns, to sustain<br>  Our stagg'ring Friends, till they their Ground regain.<br>  With this Applause the <i> Britons</i>  all adorn<br>  No rallying Troops so oft to Fight return.<br>  Did now that youthful Vigor warm my Veins<br>  Which once I felt in <i> Lusitanian</i>  Plains;<br>  Could I with such a Force the Fauchion weild,<br>  As when I slew <i> Gelanson</i>  in the Field,<br>  When <i> Romolar</i>  who flew to his Relief,<br>  Fell by the Side of that expiring Chief,<br>  While <i> Rhenus</i>  was amaz'd to see its Flood<br>  As once <i> Egyptian</i>  Rivers turn'd to Blood;<br>  I would not doubt King <i> Clotar</i>  to subdue,<br>  Whose conq'ring Arms our yielding Friends pursue.<br>  But since his Sword such Numbers have destroy'd,<br>  And <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms we see elsewhere employ'd;<br>  I'll stay no longer a Spectator here,<br>  But with King <i> Clotar</i>  will exchange a Spear.<br>  Old as I am I will my Fortune try<br>  In <i> Arthur</i> 's Cause I'm not displeas'd to dy.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the rising Fields on either Hand<br>  Where <i> Shobar</i>  and King <i> Clotar</i>  did command,<br>  A shady Thicket rose, near which the Way<br>  That led between the <i> Franks</i>  and <i> Britons,</i>  lay.<br>  <i> Moloc</i>  who often had with Joy embru'd<br>  His reeking Hands in slaughter'd Christians Blood,<br>  Who thro' their Towns with Hellish Fury past,<br>  And laid with Fire and Sword their Dwellings wast,<br>  Chose fifty <i> Gauls</i>  of equal Strength and Rage,<br>  Who did themselves in dreadful Oaths engage,<br>  Ne'er Children Wives or Lands to see again,<br>  Till they had first the mighty <i> Shobar</i>  slain.<br>  And when they saw where his stout Squadron staid<br>  They to this Thicket strait themselves convey'd:<br>  That if his Squadron should advance this Way<br>  They with united Arms might <i> Shobar</i>  slay.<br>  Now as the Warriour near the Thicket past<br>  Marching to aid his Friends with eager Hast,<br>  The <i> Gallic</i>  Foes did from their Ambush spring,<br>  And all at once their furious Javelins sling.<br>  Then with loud Clamour they did onward rush,<br>  And with unequal Force the Hero crush,<br>  While <i> Shobar</i>  rais'd his Shield and stood inclin'd,<br>  Th' Ignoble Foe <i> Morander</i>  came behind,<br>  And pierc'd between his Armours Skirts his Reins,<br>  And left the Javelin in his bleeding Veins.<br>  Great <i> Shobar</i>  wounded with th' inglorious Thrust,<br>  Fell down, and lay besmear'd with Gore and Dust.<br>  A while he lay convuls'd upon the Ground<br>  While his warm Life gush'd from the treacherous Wound.<br>  His warlike Soul flew up to take its Post,<br>  Midst the bright Squadrons of the Heav'nly Host.<br>  Yet his great Life he did not cheaply sell,<br>  For with his fatal Arms before he fell<br>  He <i> Dorlac,</i>  <i> Taman</i>  and <i> Orbassan</i>  slew,<br>  Bruis'd <i> Bodan</i> 's Head and pierc'd <i> Tibaldo</i>  thro.<br>  Nor did his Squadron stand Spectators by<br>  As unconcern'd to see great <i> Shobar</i>  dy.<br>  For valiant <i> Calmot</i>  when he saw the Chief<br>  Opprest with Numbers flew to his Relief.<br>  <i> Calmot</i>  to pious <i> Clovis</i>  was ally'd,<br>  In Blood and Vertue both, and now he dy'd<br>  Striving insulting <i> Oran</i> 's Blow to ward,<br>  And from the furious Crowd the Chief to guard.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Altubar</i>  next for Arts and Valour known<br>  Strove <i> Shobar</i> 's Life to save, but lost his own.<br>  Next thro' the Files noble <i> Gravellan</i>  broke,<br>  But came too late to save the fatal Stroke.<br>  But on the Field he left <i> Moranson</i>  dead,<br>  And with his Fauchion struck off <i> Moloc</i> 's Head.<br>  Thus <i> Shobar</i>  fell unable to withstand<br>  The suddain Charge of such a desp'rate Band.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  rav'd to see him lying slain<br>  By ignominious Arms upon the Plain.<br>  And to revenge so great a Captain's Fall,<br>  With utmost Rage they charg'd the treach'rous <i> Gaul</i> <br>  Th' amaz'd Conspirators the Fight forsook,<br>  And their swift Flight back to the Thicket took.<br>  <i> Gravellan</i>  close pursu'd with Sword in Hand,<br>  And such a Slaughter made that of the Band<br>  Which made the treacherous Onset, only two<br>  <i> Gamol</i>  and <i> Arpan</i>  from their Fury flew.<br>  Great <i> Shobar</i> 's Fall reveng'd, the valiant Chief<br>  March'd with his Troops to give his Friends Relief.<br>  Who prest too hard by <i> Clotar</i> 's Arms retir'd,<br>  And whom his Presence with fresh Life inspir'd.<br>  When <i> Solmar</i>  likewise saw those Troops dismay'd<br>  He brought the <i> Ordovicians</i>  to their Aid.<br>  Thus reinforc'd the rallying <i> Britons</i>  burn'd<br>  With a new Flame, and to the Fight return'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the <i> Franks</i>  and <i> Britons</i>  high enrag'd,<br>  Were close thro' all the bloody Field engag'd.<br>  Now Files on Files, Cohorts on Cohorts rush,<br>  Steeds Steeds o'erturn, Spearmen at Spearmen push.<br>  Shields ring on Shields, Fauchions with Fauchions clash<br>  And Flames from clatt'ring Arms, like Lightning, flash.<br>  Thick Clouds of Dust obscure th' astonish'd Skys,<br>  And on the Field ghastly Destruction lys.<br>  Buckler lay heap'd on Buckler, Dead on Dead,<br>  And sever'd Limbs and Heads the Ground o'erspread.<br>  Loud Shouts, prodigious Clamour, warlike Sound<br>  From Hill to Hill, from Sphear to Sphear rebound.<br>  The Neighings of the Coursers, and the Noise<br>  Of batt'ring Arms, and raging Captains Voice,<br>  Insulting Threats of Conq'rours, and the Prayer<br>  Of vanquish'd Warriours, fill the ecchoing Air.<br>  As when an Earthquake shakes the cavern'd Soil,<br>  And rocking Mountains of <i> Sicilia</i> 's Isle<br>  Th' imprison'd Tempests bellowing in the Caves<br>  Raise on the heaving Fields amazing Waves.<br>  The Sea no more restrain'd by ancient Shores,<br>  In new unfashion'd Channels foams,

 <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Gaston</i>  mean time did their left Wing invade,<br>  And thro' the <i> British</i>  Files great Slaughter made.<br>  He march'd along the Plain with Martial Grace,<br>  Mighty of Bulk, and of Gigantic Race.<br>  A while as Conq'rour he maintain'd the Field,<br>  And to his Force the <i> Britons</i>  long did yield.<br>  Till aided by a fresh and strong Recruit<br>  They rally'd, and reviv'd the hot Dispute.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  with their Troops encompass'd round<br>  <i> Gaston</i>  advanc'd too far on hostile ground.<br>  Archers their Arrows on the

Mail.<br>  On his hard Back they pour a fruitless War,<br>  Which strait recoyls, but can't imprint a Scar.<br>  So did the temper'd Steel unpierc'd repel<br>  The Weapons which on <i> Gaston</i> 's Buckler fell,<br>  Like an <i> Egyptian</i>  Obelisk he stood,<br>  Or as a lofty brazen Pillar show'd,<br>  Which grateful Citys out of high respect,<br>  To Princes or Victorious Chiefs erect.<br>  Thus stood the mighty Champion and defy'd<br>  The various Deaths which flew on every side.<br>  With proud Disdain he travers'd all the Ground<br>  Then stood, and cast his Haughty Eyes around.<br>  Aloud he cry'd, what have you not a Knight<br>  In Battle bold, and brave enough in Fight<br>  To come out hither and his fame advance,<br>  By being slain by <i> Gaston</i> 's Conquering Lance.<br>  Then let him come, let him his Valour try,<br>  And chuse the way by which he'd rather dy.<br>  Will none step forth his name to Eternize,<br>  For that he gains, who by this Weapon dys.<br>  While

shameful Flight.<br>  By this time Flying on with eager hast<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  advanc'd within a Javlin's cast,<br>  Then thus he Cry'd, <i> Gaston</i>  a Foe appears<br>  Not us'd to Idle words, but active Spears.<br>  Then from his Arm his mighty Spear he cast,<br>  Exploded Light'ning scarcely flys so fast,<br>  Which the strong <i> Hero</i> 's sevenfold Buckler struck,<br>  It past Six folds, but in the last it stuck.<br>  Then <i> Gaston</i>  with enormous fury burn'd,<br>  And his Vast Spear with mighty force return'd.<br>  When to discharge the Weapon he prepar'd,<br>  He all his

Receiv'd within his Shield the massy Spear.<br>  Within the outmost folds the Point stuck fast,<br>  And not the middle of its thickness past.<br>  A shiv'ring Dread thro' both the Armys went,<br>  On

did divide<br>  The treble Plate, and fourfold Bullock's Hide,<br>  Then pierc'd his Belly with a dreadful Wound,<br>  Which tore his Flesh, that clos'd his Bowels round.<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  no longer could in Combate stand,<br>  But threw his Spear and Buckler on the Sand,<br>  And held his reeking Entrails in his Hand.<br>  Off from the Field the wounded Chief did fly,<br>  And fill'd the Region with a dismal Cry.<br>  So when a bold <i> Rhinoceros</i>  in Fight<br>  With a strong <i> Elephant</i>  compares his Might:<br>  The noble Combate all the Forest fills,<br>  And Terror strikes thro' all th' ecchoing Hills.<br>  This with his Trunk invades, and every Blow<br>  Rings on the scaly Armour of the Foe:<br>  Who with his Horn do's on th' Assailant rush,<br>  And makes a furious but a fruitless push.<br>  The Warriours long a doubtful Fight maintain,<br>  And spend a thousand noble Strokes in vain.<br>  Till the <i> Rhinoceros</i>  do's gore by chance<br>  The Foe's soft

therefore to <i> Britannia</i>  must return<br>  To quench the Flames wherewith the <i> Britons</i>  burn.<br>  When from its Fears my Kingdom I have freed,<br>  Back to the Camp I'll come with equal

maintain your Post.<br>  Such valiant Troops can never be annoy'd,<br>  If private Strife and Contests they avoid.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceas'd. The Captains by their Aspect show'd<br>  The Joy was sunk which from their Conquest flow'd.<br>  They griev'd to hear the pious King relate<br>  What Strife embroil'd <i> Britannia</i> 's troubled State;<br>  Which forc'd him to forsake the <i> Gallic</i>  Soil,<br>  To re-establish Peace in <i> Albion</i> 's Isle.<br>  Then from his Princely Seat King <i> Arthur</i>  rose<br>  Intending <i>

they reach'd the Shore without Delay<br>  They all embark'd, and strait stood out to Sea.<br>  The bounding Vessel ran before the Wind,<br>  Leaving <i> Neustrasia</i> 's Rocks and Towers behind.<br>  And when the rising Sun dispell'd the Night,<br>  The <i> Regnian</i>  Strand appear'd within their Sight.<br>  Soon as they came on Shore they took the Way<br>  To <i> Domar</i> 's <i> Castle</i> , there resolv'd to stay,<br>  Till brave <i> Gravellan</i>  should return, who sent<br>  To learn the State of things t' <i> Augusta</i>  went,<br>  And down from thence his chiefest Frinds to

Merit vaunt.<br>  Those who to give a troubled Kingdom Ease<br>  Cherish these restless Sects, do but release<br>  Outragious Winds to calm th' unquiet Seas.<br>  Such call the Foe in, to Protect the

the monstrous Brood<br>  Like Vermin hatch'd in <i> Nile</i> 's prolific Mud,<br>  O'erspread the Land, th' uneasy State molest,<br>  Devour our Country, and the Church infest.<br>  The Sediment which

for Freedom strive,<br>  Which they when Masters ne'er to others give.<br>  The Church's temperate Empire they destroy,<br>  That they themselves a wider may enjoy.<br>  'Tis not in point of Power we

Lovers of the Church Incense.<br>  Her Sons too far transported with their Rage,<br>  For her Protection now in Arms engage.<br>  The Trait'rous Deed all highly must condemn,<br>  But would you soon th' impetuous Torrent stem,<br>  Would you at once the threatning Troops disarm,<br>  Which o'er <i> Brittania</i> 's troubled Region swarm,<br>  Against audacious Schismaticks declare,<br>  With Vigor carry on the Pious War.<br>  Revoke th' Indulgence granted, and restore<br>  To <i> Britain</i> 's ancient Church her ancient Power.<br>  Her Friends whom now too much Resentment warms,<br>  Will at your royal Feet cast down their Arms.<br>  This pious Edict will their Troops disband,<br>  Secure your Throne, and bless with Peace the Land.<br>  Then mighty Monarch unmolested you<br>  Your

civil Broils which <i> Albion</i>  discompose<br>  From Fears and anxious Jealousies arose,<br>  Lest the proud Sects which kindly you protect,<br>  Should once their Empire o'er the Church erect.<br>  'Tis true, that some who with the Rebels joyn,<br>  Their Country's Fall, and <i> Gallia</i> 's Growth design;<br>  But if those Troops which for the Church appear<br>  Submit their Arms, the rest we need not fear.<br>  Now 'tis with Reason that the Church suspects<br>  The Growth of proud, morose, designing Sects.<br>  I've long observ'd their Pride and Arrogance,<br>  And what destructive Doctrines they advance.<br>  Where they prevail the Church is soon defac'd,<br>  Becomes a wild, uncultivated Wast.<br>  A horrid Wilderness wherein we see<br>  The monstrous Forms of howling Heresy.<br>  Where Grisly Schism, and raging Strife appear<br>  And raving Sects each other rend and tear.<br>  Where mad Enthusiasm and Discord reign,<br>  And endless Errors endless War maintain.<br>  These sad Effects their Liberty abus'd<br>  Thro' <i> Albion</i> 's Isle already has produc'd.<br>  Audacious Schismaticks with lawless Pride<br>  Affront the Church, and all her Laws deride.<br>  Now Heresy her odious Head do's rear,<br>  And fresh engender'd Monsters thick appear,<br>  Which run upon the Church with open Jaws<br>  And fasten in her Wounds their dreadful Claws.<br>  Ev'n ancient Heresys which once annoy'd<br>  The Church's Peace, but seem'd long since destroy'd,<br>  Now chear'd and warm'd by this indulgent Heat,<br>  Stretch out their hideous Limbs, and Life and Vigor get.<br>  Since the Rebellious <i> Britons</i>  but reveal<br>  In a Religious Cause an erring Zeal,<br>  And for themselves alledge they flew to Arms<br>  To save their Altars from the Foe's Alarms;<br>  I must for <i> Arman</i> 's wise Advice declare,<br>  As likely to prevent th' Effects of War.<br>  Th' Indulgence granted to the Sects revoke<br>  And thus Sedition's quell'd without a Stroke.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceas'd. And Reverend <i> Olbar</i>  rose and spoke.<br>  The Gospel Genius and a Christian Mind<br>  All fierce destructive Methods still declin'd.<br>  Our Founder did not raise his Regal Throne<br>  By his

and God-like Gentleness.<br>  When urg'd by eager Zealots to employ<br>  Fire ev'n from Heav'n Opposers to destroy,<br>  He us'd no other Flames, but those of Love,<br>  The gentle Fire he brought down from above.<br>  The blest Restorer of undone Mankind<br>  With soft and mild perswasive Ways inclin'd<br>  The World his Heav'nly Mission to believe,<br>  And his bright Train of Blessings to receive.<br>  He us'd no other Force, no other Arms<br>  But Mercy's tender Crys and Pity's Charms.<br>  And all his Followers he oblig'd to be<br>  Gentle, and kind, and merciful as he.<br>  He gave Command they should in Friendship live,<br>  Patient of Wrongs, and easie to forgive.<br>  Mutual Forbearance, Meekness, Peace and Love<br>  Which fashion Men like the pure Minds above,<br>  He oft declar'd were Heav'nly Marks disign'd<br>  To make them known from th' unbelieving Kind.<br>  He never arm'd his Church with Regal Power,<br>  Nor bad the strong the weaker Part devour.<br>  He to the valiant Champions of the Faith<br>  Allow'd the Serpent's Wisdom, not his Teeth.<br>  He came from Heav'n lost Blessings to restore<br>  But took from Men none they possest before.<br>  He ne'er pronounc'd Error or Unbelief,<br>  Just Forfeitures of Liberty or Life.<br>  He never bad his Church for Arms declare<br>  Nor taught the Rules and Stratagems of War.<br>  He never show'd them how Campaigns to make,<br>  How to defend, and how they should attack.<br>  He ne'er instructed them in future Days<br>  When numerous grown, what Bulwarks they should raise.<br>  What Forts and Cittadels they should erect<br>  The Church's sacred Frontier to protect.<br>  He came to save Mens Lives, and not to Kill,<br>  And therefore taught no Military Skill.<br>  No Models left of Arsenals to be reer'd,<br>  Nor said what Warlike Stores should be prepar'd.<br>  His Church he ne'er Commanded to Amass<br>  Spears, Fauchions, Helmets, Shields and Boots of Brass.<br>  Her Valiant Champions first with Error strove<br>  In Arms Divine, and Armour from above,<br>  Immortal Truth, and Light, and Heav'nly Love.<br>  Thus Arm'd the Chiefs their glorious Course pursu'd,<br>  Defeated Vice, and Ignorance subdu'd.<br>  Error before them fled, and Pagan Gods<br>  Of Light impatient, left their old abodes.<br>  Then a wide Empire Christian Faith possest,<br>  And Truth Divine Believing Nations blest.<br>  The White <i> European</i>  and the Swarthy <i> Moor</i> ,<br>  With a like flame Religion did adore.<br>  So powerful then were her Celestial Arms,<br>  So bright her Form, so ravishing her Charms,<br>  That where she came th' obsequious World obey'd,<br>  And at her Altars due Devotion paid.<br>  But when she once her Heav'nly Strength forsook,<br>  And in Exchange Terrestrial Weapons took,<br>  When Martial Faith in Armour first appear'd,<br>  And in the Field her bloody Standard reer'd,<br>  Advancing like an <i> Amazonian</i>  Dame<br>  To vanquish Heresy with Sword and Flame;<br>  The World at such a Figure stood amaz'd,<br>  And on the hideous Sight with horror gaz'd.<br>  Against her Throne the Nations soon rebell'd,<br>  And Arms with Arms, and Power with Power repell'd.<br>  Her Innocence, her Love, and Meekness lost,<br>  The warlike Church could no new Triumphs boast.<br>  She soon was stopt in her Victorious Course,<br>  Weak by her Arms, and impotent by Force.<br>  Christ's peaceful Flock with Wolves devouring Jaws,<br>  And his meek Dove arm'd with the Faulcon's Claws,<br>  Prodigious Monsters to the World appear'd,<br>  No longer to be lov'd, and scarcely fear'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion thus against it self was arm'd,<br>  And Civil War the troubled Church alarm'd!<br>  Temple contended Temple to subdue,<br>  And Flames from Altars, against Altars flew.<br>  Religion endless Revolutions saw,<br>  And all by turns were Orthodox by Law.<br>  The Men condemn'd for Hereticks before<br>  Grew Apostolic, as they grew in Power.<br>  Prevailing Sects did weaker Sects invade,<br>  And Desolation not Conversions made.<br>  For Pain and Suff'rings may indeed affright,<br>  But can't perswade us with Convincing Light.<br>  Torments 'tis true strong Arguments appear,<br>  But 'tis not to our Reason, but our Fear.<br>  Our Heav'nly Founder who at distance saw<br>  Ambitious Churchmen back'd with Power and Law,<br>  Their Peaceful Neigbours would with force invade,<br>  Disarm'd the Gown, and Violence forbad.<br>  Nor do those Princes for their Peace provide,<br>  Who with one Sect against all others side.<br>  Those Counsels therefore <i> Arman</i>  gives for Peace<br>  Both as unjust, and dangerous too, displease.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceas'd. Then noble <i> Sefel</i>  did begin,<br>  Of Prince like Presence, and Majestic Mien.<br>  A noble Genius to the Muses dear,<br>  Yet none knew better how the State to steer<br>  Whom every Minister and every Bard<br>  With equal Awe, and Rev'rence did regard.<br>  To form the wondrous Man great <i> Pompey</i> 's Mind,<br>  And <i> Tully</i> 's flowing Eloquence combin'd.<br>  All Orators grew proud who gain'd his praise,<br>  And where he pleas'd he gave the Poet's Bays.<br>  All charg'd with lessening or debasing Wit<br>  His Sentence did Condemn, or did Acquit.<br>  The trembling Bards at his Tribunal stood,<br>  None prais'd their Songs, till he pronounc'd them good.<br>  None strove with greater Prudence to compose<br>  Contentious Heats, which in the Church arose.<br>  Then this wise <i> Briton</i>  thus himself exprest,<br>  And show'd how <i> Albion</i> 's Strife might be supprest.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subjects who Tribute to their Monarch pay,<br>  And Peacefully his just Commands obey,<br>  With highest Justice from their Prince expect<br>  He should their Lives and Libertys protect.<br>  No Errors in Religion can destroy<br>  Th' Immunitys which we, as Men, enjoy.<br>  Those whom the Churchmen as Sectarians blame,<br>  Lose not the Rights which they as Subjects claim.<br>  The Sacred Laws our Heav'nly Author made,<br>  Were not to force Belief, but to Perswade.<br>  Prisons were ne'er for Christian Schools design'd,<br>  Nor Whips and Racks for Arguments enjoyn'd.<br>  Unless our Wills could Laws to Reason give,<br>  And Man could what he pleas'd, as Truth believe,<br>  Force for Conversion is employ'd in vain;<br>  Whose Judgment ever was inform'd by Pain?<br>  Churches should Arms forbear till they agree<br>  On some unerring mark of Heresy.<br>  Some Christians call'd, of Antichristian mind,<br>  To Force and not to Argument inclin'd.<br>  To take the Sword lay down the Pastor's Crook,<br>  And into Wolves convert their Peaceful Flock.<br>  Forth against Schism they march exclaiming loud,<br>  And make the Church a reeking Field of Blood.<br>  These Sons of Thunder thus the Gospel Preach,<br>  And red in Slaughter Heav'nly Meekness teach.<br>  These Men perswade, and make their Doctrines known,<br>  Not by th' Almighty's Terrours, but their own.<br>  Declining Reason's mild perswasive Course,<br>  They Press for Heav'n, and Christians Lift by force.<br>  These from the Temple's Battlements display<br>  The bloody Flag, and draw out in Array<br>  Their Warlike Orders, who Embattled stand<br>  With Sabres, not the Gospel in their hand.<br>  Then breathing Fire, they March Mankind to free<br>  From Hereticks, as well as Heresy.<br>  How ill her Arms and Military dress<br>  The Gentle, Meek and Passive Church express?<br>  How will this Equipage and strange disguise,<br>  The mild Restorer of Mankind surprise?<br>  How will he like his Vineyard which appears<br>  A Bulwark'd Camp all planted o'er with Spears?<br>  How will he know his Church in Tented Fields,<br>  Midst Chariots, Steeds, bright Helms and blazing Shields?<br>  How will he know her when with Conquest proud,<br>  Laden with Spoils and Garments roll'd in blood?<br>  These Arm'd Evangelists must sure displease<br>  Their Gentle Lord, the Prince of Love and Peace.<br>  When Converts first were in <i> Britannia</i>  made,<br>  The Christian Planters only did perswade.<br>  When they were few, easy to be supprest,<br>  Then the Religion which the Sword possest,<br>  Was not allow'd a Right to crush the rest:<br>  Then Persecution was aloud condemn'd,<br>  And Violence the highest Crime esteem'd.<br>  And shall the Christians strong and numerous grown,<br>  The Maxims which advanc'd their Church disown?<br>  Shall they Assert an Antichristian Power<br>  Their disagreeing Neighbours to devour,<br>  Which if the Pagan Princes had employ'd,<br>  The Christian Church long since had been destroy'd?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But grant the Church Sectarians may restrain<br>  Inflicting rigorous Penaltys and Pain,<br>  Grant too that this the Rebels will appease,<br>  Who will have none, if others have their Ease?<br>  Will this <i> Britannia</i> 's troubled State compose,<br>  Or dry the Spring whence our Disturbance flows?<br>  Will not th' opprest Sectarian think it hard<br>  To be of Rights to Subjects due debar'd?<br>  Will <i> Arthur</i>  thus their Services reward?<br>  Those who themselves and humane Nature know<br>  Foresee the Mischiefs that from hence must flow.<br>  Those whom unjust Severities provoke<br>  Will struggle hard to break th' uneasy Yoke.<br>  All will conspire, as they Occasion find,<br>  To sink a Government to them unkind.<br>  Whom States oppress they Enemys create,<br>  Who, when they safely can, express their Hate.<br>  If Princes but a Party will protect,<br>  They on a narrow Base their Throne erect,<br>  And can't be more than Monarchs of a Sect.<br>  Wise Princes who would lasting Peace create,<br>  And from all restless Bigots save the State,<br>  Should not on any side their Power engage,<br>  But guard the weaker from the Stronger's Rage.<br>  No Fav'rite Party should their Sword employ,<br>  Those, whom they cannot proselite, to destroy.<br>  Wise Parents if their Sons for Power contest,<br>  Will no one aid to Ruin all the rest.<br>  Monarchs who seek their own and Subjects Ease,<br>  Between contending Sects should keep the Peace.<br>  All will obey when all Protection find,<br>  And Rev'rence Kings without Distinction kind.<br>  Could greater Number, Power, or Splendor shew<br>  What Churches are erroneous, what are true,<br>  Yet peaceful Subjects have a just Pretence<br>  To be secur'd from Force and Violence:<br>  I still would guard Sectarians from the Awe<br>  Of Courts of Justice and coercive Law.<br>  This will to all the Government commend,<br>  And every Subject will be too a Friend.<br>  Freely to speak my Sense in this Debate,<br>  The Way suggested to compose the State<br>  By ceasing all Sectarians to protect,<br>  Because not just, nor wise, I would reject.<br>  I would perswade King <i> Arthur</i>  to decree,<br>  And strait proclaim a gen'ral Amnesty.<br>  This would the Rebels into Friends convert,<br>  And make the <i> British</i>  Youth their Chiefs desert.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  soon grow hot, but soon repent,<br>  They threaten high, but with soft Words relent.<br>  Their Love to Liberty and ancient Laws,<br>  Oft turns to Jealousy without a Cause:<br>  With whose impatient Flames they quickly burn,<br>  But to their Temper do as soon return.<br>  Their Passions swell, but easily subside,<br>  Kind Looks, and Words repress th' o'erflowing Tide.<br>  The Rebels sure must dread King <i> Arthur</i> 's Name,<br>  And think on their Ingratitude with Shame.<br>  The common Men by specious Words misled<br>  Begin the fatal Consequence to dread.<br>  A general Pardon then to all declare<br>  And you prevent the sad Effects of War.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceas'd and most applauded his Advice:<br>  The <i> British</i>  Monarch, as an Angel wise,<br>  Who by his God-like Temper was inclin'd<br>  To Pity, and support opprest Mankind,<br>  With <i> Olbar</i> 's and with <i> Sefel</i> 's Language mov'd<br>  Their Prudence and their Piety approv'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time the Rebels at <i> Cononium</i>  lay,<br>  And as their Head did <i> Morogan</i>  obey,<br>  When they had heard that on the <i> Regnian</i>  Strand,<br>  The pious King was safely come to Land.<br>  Their Monarch's Presence some began to dread,<br>  And in their Breasts a secret Terror fed.<br>  They trembled at his Arms, and Warlike Fame,<br>  And seem'd already vanquish'd with his Name.<br>  Some of a less ungrateful Mind begun<br>  To think of all the Wonders he had done<br>  And what his Arms had for <i> Britannia</i>  won.<br>  How to a Thousand various Dangers, he<br>  To save <i> Britannia</i> 's State by Land and Sea,<br>  Midst Storms and more inexorable Foes,<br>  His sacred Life did freely oft expose.<br>  What vast Herculean Toyl he underwent<br>  <i> Albion</i> 's impending Ruin to prevent.<br>  What Patience, what amazing Fortitude,<br>  The God-like Man in endless Labour shew'd,<br>  <i> Britannia</i> 's Peace and Freedom to restore,<br>  To raise her Glory, and extend her Power.<br>  Many for this who dar'd in Arms appear<br>  Mov'd by their Gratitude, or by their Fear<br>  In numerous Bodys did the Camp forsake,<br>  And by Desertion left the Rebels weak.<br>  They now their Levity, and Folly mourn'd,<br>  And to their Houses and their Farms return'd.<br>  Amongst the Rebels hence disorders grew,<br>  And great Distrust and Contests did ensue.<br>  The Leaders saw they could no more depend<br>  On their rash Troops their Treason to defend.<br>  They found the <i> British</i>  Youth would never stand<br>  Against an Host where <i> Arthur</i>  did Command.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Morogan</i>  perplex'd his Servants sent,<br>  To call the Chief Commanders to his Tent:<br>  That they might all things prudently debate<br>  That to th' Important Juncture did relate.<br>  Straight to their Gen'rals high Pavilion came<br>  The Chiefs of highest Trust, and greatest Name.<br>  To whom the General thus himself addrest,<br>  <i> Britons,</i>  you see the Zeal which some exprest<br>  For <i> Albion</i> 's Liberty is soon expir'd: <br>  You see, what Troops are from our Camp retir'd.<br>  A fresh example here, brave Friends, you see<br>  Of the weak Vulgars Fear and Levity.<br>  Speak what you think a prudent Man should do,<br>  Shall we desist, or our Design pursue?<br>  Then many Chiefs did various ways suggest<br>  Which they believ'd in this Conjuncture best.<br>  But while in sharp debate they did oppose<br>  Each other's Counsel, great disturbance rose.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Adal</i>  who in Wisdom all the rest,<br>  And Eloquence excell'd, his Thoughts exprest.<br>  <i> Britons,</i>  with great astonishment we see<br>  The Wavering Crowd do's from our Banners flee.<br>  The Vulgar we by this sad Instance find,<br>  As Seas unstable, changing as the Wind.<br>  All our Affairs are now in such a State,<br>  As must oblige us to Capitulate.<br>  With any Terms King <i> Arthur</i>  will comply,<br>  That shall disarm a <i> British</i>  Enemy.<br>  His Heart is so on Foreign Conquest set,<br>  He'll easily what's done at home forget.<br>  He would abroad be for a Hero shown,<br>  Nor cares at home to know or to be known.<br>  To our Demands no doubt he'll soon assent,<br>  Domestic War and Tumults to prevent.<br>  The Terms on which I'm willing to agree,<br>  Are first an Universal Amnesty.<br>  That all who please may undisturb'd retreat,<br>  Or to their City, or their Rural Seat.<br>  And all who in the State have been employ'd<br>  Shall keep the Places they before enjoy'd.<br>  But all the Chiefs and Captains who declare<br>  They'll serve King <i> Arthur</i>  in his Foreign War,<br>  When they attend him to the <i> Gallic</i>  Land,<br>  They in his Troops shall have the same Command.<br>  He ceas'd. The rest fearing an ill Event,<br>  In loud Applauses gave a full Assent.<br>  So when the Dogs that chase a timorous Hind<br>  Which o'er the Lawns flys swifter than the Wind,<br>  Are at a fault, and now enjoy no more<br>  The cheerful Scent that lay so hot before:<br>  If some Stanch Hound who rarely do's mistake,<br>  In great Esteem and Credit with the Pack,<br>  Opens, to tell that he the Scent has found,<br>  The rest attending to the joyful sound,<br>  In his Experience and his Skill confide,<br>  And follow with full Cry their faithful Guide.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then four Commanders from the rest they chose,<br>  In whom they all could Confidence repose.<br>  Who to the Castle where King <i> Arthur</i>  lay,<br>  To make this Overture strait took their way.<br>  Where they arriv'd during the great debate,<br>  About the measures to compose the State.<br>  Which ended, they admitted to the King,<br>  The Message told they had in Charge to bring.<br>  The Pious Monarch who his Subjects lov'd,<br>  By tender Mercy and Compassion mov'd,<br>  To win the Rebels hearts did soon agree,<br>  To grant the Universal Amnesty.<br>  Nor did he think it prudent to withstand,<br>  Those other Terms the Rebels did demand.<br>  That he henceforth might undisturb'd pursue<br>  His high design King <i> Clotar</i>  to subdue.<br>  That he his Forreign Conquests might repeat,<br>  And the Deliv'rance of the <i> Gauls</i>  compleat.<br>  For Crafty <i> Adal</i>  wisely did suggest<br>  That the chief Passion in King <i> Arthur</i> 's breast<br>  Was Liberty to <i> Neustria</i>  to restore,<br>  And free the Christian <i> Franks</i>  from <i> Clotar</i> 's power.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Messengers that from the Rebels went<br>  Back to their Friends were by King <i> Arthur</i>  sent.<br>  Where they their Monarch's gracious Pardon read,<br>  As was agreed, at every Squadron's head.<br>  That done, the Chiefs did all their Troops disband,<br>  And from Seditious Uproar freed the Land.<br>  Thus did <i> Britannia</i> 's jarring Discord Cease,<br>  And in its place return'd Harmonious Peace.<br>  So soon King <i> Arthur</i> 's Fame and Presence quell'd<br>  The Discontented <i> Britons</i>  who Rebel'd.<br>  As when a Heav'nly Angel comes to Chase<br>  Infernal Fiends from some Inchanted Place.<br>  Forthwith th' Inchantment's force is gone, and Hell<br>  No longer Aids the black Magician's Spell.<br>  Th' Imaginary Castles disappear,<br>  The brazen Gates and Bulwarks melt to Air.<br>  No Warriours more in Airy Armour stand,<br>  Griping prodigious Bucklers in their hand:<br>  Phantastic Monsters are no longer seen,<br>  But all the Pageant Horrors quit the Scene.<br>  The struggling Air throws off the Magic Chains,<br>  And strait appear sweet Meads and flowry Plains.<br>  So all the Terrours which did <i> Albion</i>  feare,<br>  At <i> Arthur</i> 's Presence vanish'd into Air.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i> Briton</i>  who with ardent Zeal did burn,<br>  Back to his Troops in <i> Gallia</i>  to return.<br>  Now all things for his Voyage did prepare,<br>  And to protect <i> Britannia</i>  did declare<br>  What Lords he did invest with Regal Power<br>  In whom both Prince and People were Secure.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Olbar</i>  was first a mild and prudent Guide,<br>  Who o'er <i> Britannia</i> 's Churches did preside.<br>  Nor Care nor Pains th' Indulgent Pastor spar'd,<br>  Nor Vigilance his Flock to Feed and Guard.<br>  His Erudition did their Reverence move,<br>  And his diffusive Charity their Love.<br>  His Christian Temper oft Contention charm'd,<br>  And the hot Bigots of all Sects disarm'd.<br>  By Moderation, Patience, Gentleness<br>  And Candor which to all he did express.<br>  He ever strove th' Erroneous to reduce,<br>  Who to the Church Obedience did refuse.<br>  But he Employ'd to set their Judgments right,<br>  No Force but Reason's mild but powerful Light.<br>  Resolv'd on Truth and not on Power to stand<br>  He did the Lictors of the Church disband.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time upon his Adamantine Throne sate<br>  That high amidst th' Etherial Region shone<br>  Th' Eternal Sate, collected in his Might,<br>  Girt with Omnipotence, and cloath' d with Light.<br>  The Sons of God who serve his high Command<br>  Adoring round the sacred Mount did stand:<br>  Angels, Arch-Angels, great Seraphic States<br>  Heav'n's Viceroys, Generals, and great

they had in Charge.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither repair'd ambitious <i> Lucifer</i> ,<br>  And in the bright Assembly did appear;<br>  Distinguish'd by his Form so much decay'd,<br>  And the deep Scars by vengeful Lightning made.<br>  Like a torn Oak above the verdant Wood<br>  Blasted from Heav'n the ruin'd Seraph stood;<br>  Prepar'd the Just and Upright to arraign,<br>  And his black

Usurper of the Air<br>  Whence dost thou come to these blest Seats, declare.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' Apostate thus return'd. I dayly rowl<br>  From farthest <i> East</i>  to <i> West,</i>  from Pole to Pole.<br>  O'er Hills and Dales I pass, o'er Lands and Floods<br>  O'er howling Desarts, Wilds, and spacious Woods.<br>  I cross the raging Seas from Isle to Isle,<br>  And fly from Realm to Realm with endless Toil,<br>  To learn the State of Empires, and to know<br>  What busy Mortals say and do below.<br>  O'er the Terrestrial Regions thus I roam,<br>  And now from wandring there, am hither come.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' Eternal to th' Impostor thus reply'd:<br>  In all thy tedious Journeys far and wide<br>  Hast thou observ'd my Servant <i> Arthur</i> 's Ways,<br>  That just and perfect Man who still obeys<br>  With chearful Zeal and Pleasure my Command<br>  And rules with equal Laws the <i> British</i>  Land.<br>  Whom I've anointed, Tyrants to destroy<br>  And proud Oppressors who the World annoy.<br>  To ease th' afflicted and relieve the poor<br>  And banish'd Peace and Justice to restore.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Lucifer</i>  reply'd:<br>  'Tis true King <i> Arthur</i>  in the Field succeeds,<br>  And by his Arms atchieves Heroic Deeds.<br>  His Zeal seems great to serve the Christian Cause,<br>  And his vast Labors have procur'd Applause.<br>  But do's the pious Monarch serve for nought,<br>  And Vertue's Cause for Vertue's sake promote?<br>  Is all this Zeal for pure Religion shown?<br>  Do's he pursue Heav'n's Int'rest, or his own?<br>  Do's not a steep insuperable Mound<br>  Rais'd by thy Hand this <i> Briton</i> 's Throne surround?<br>  Fenc'd thus about he do's the Foe despise,<br>  Mocks all their Rage, and all their Power defys.<br>  Do not Seraphic Squadrons aid his Arms,<br>  And guard his Camp against the Foe's Alarms?<br>  Do not the bright, divine Militia stand,<br>  Immortal Sabres flaming in their Hand<br>  Around this Fav'rite Monarch, to direct<br>  His Conduct, and his Armys to protect?<br>  Do's not the Angel of thy Presence lead<br>  His Armys forth, and his Battalions head?<br>  'Tis known he still attends him in the Field,<br>  And do's his Head in the hot Battle shield.<br>  He watches always with officious Care<br>  To guard his Life from the sharp Edge of War.<br>  He in the Front of Battle do's appear<br>  And shakes against the Host his dreadful Spear.<br>  He marches on before him to the Foe<br>  Divides their Files, and lets this Favourite thro'.<br>  No Wonder then he should such Laurels gain,<br>  And ride so oft triumphant o'er the slain.<br>  That vanquish'd Nations should receive his Yoke,<br>  For those that him oppose, thy Wrath provoke.<br>  In vain his Foes their hot Revenge pursue,<br>  He must prevail, till Heav'n they first subdue.<br>  Tho various Deaths in horrid Shapes convey'd<br>  On every side th' encircled King invade,<br>  Tho' Showers of Darts and glitt'ring Javelins fly,<br>  Hissing, like deadly Adders thro' the Sky:<br>  Tho' o'er the bloody Field Destruction reigns<br>  And loads with ghastly Heaps the slipp'ry Plains,<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  encompass'd with Celestial Bands,<br>  As if a God invulnerable stands.<br>  Those Heav'n defends from Danger are secure,<br>  And those it fights for, are of Triumph sure.<br>  King <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms immortal Wreaths have won<br>  By Power receiv'd from hence, and not his own. <br>  Th' admiring World profusely praise bestow,<br>  And worship <i> Arthur</i>  as a God below.<br>  In time they'll Altars to his Name erect,<br>  And ask his Aid their Kingdoms to protect.<br>  No wonder then the <i> Briton</i>  do's pretend<br>  Such Zeal for Heav'n, while Heav'n is such a Friend.<br>  But let it now withdraw its aiding Hand,<br>  And like impartial Judges neutral stand:<br>  Or let some unexpected Suff'ring prove<br>  His fam'd Integrity, and stedfast Love,<br>  And thou shalt find he'll curse thee to thy Face,<br>  And shew himself of Man's apostate Race.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did th' Allmighty thus reply, to prove<br>  King <i> Arthur</i> 's Patience, Fortitude and Love<br>  To shew how much the mighty Man can bear,<br>  And how unjust these Accusations are,<br>  For twice seven Days thou mayst his Vertue try,<br>  Use all thy Arts to prove his Constancy.<br>  For that determin'd Space he's in thy Power,<br>  His sacred Person only I secure.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Darkness felt an inward Joy<br>  From Heav'n's Permission <i> Arthur</i>  to annoy.<br>  Down thro' th' aeirial Void he swiftly flew<br>  His deep Revenge and Malice to pursue:<br>  In mighty Wrath, knowing the time but short,<br>  He came, to make his terrible Effort.<br>  So when in ancient <i> Rome</i>  a furious Beast<br>  With Hunger pinch'd was from his Den releast<br>  A constant Christian Martyr to devour<br>  Condemn'd by some Imperial Monster's Power,<br>  He roar'd and ran with open Jaws to tear<br>  His Prey and pleas'd the bloody Theater.<br>  Th' infernal Prince from Heav'n's Cerulean Top<br>  Shot thro' the liquid Gulph, nor did he stop<br>  Till he had reach'd the thick inferiour Air,<br>  And saw beneath King <i> Arthur</i> 's Ships appear.<br>  In th' Atmosphear with level Wings he hung,<br>  And calld with such a thund'ring Voice, as rung<br>  Thro' all the Skys, and with its dreadful Sound<br>  Shook all the Rocks, and Shores, and Hills around.<br>  His dusky Ministers who Storms prepare<br>  And temper flaming Meteors in the Air,<br>  Who dress the Magazins of Hail and Rain,<br>  And whip wild Whirl winds round to vex the Main, <br>  The Engineers that in the troubled Skys<br>  Recruit exhausted Clouds with fresh Supplys,<br>  These their great Leader's Summons did obey<br>  And to receive his

their Angry Forces joyn<br>  T' oppose your Arms, and thwart your high Design.<br>  These did the Seas with this fierce Storm embroil,<br>  To beat your Navy from <i> Neustrasia</i> 's Soil.<br>  Your Arms, to try your Vertue, are delay'd,<br>  So Heav'n permits, and Heav'n must be obey'd.<br>  Know, by supream Command I now prepare<br>  To chase the Demons that infest the Air,<br>  Down to their Prisons, that the troubled Seas<br>  May rest enjoy, and the fierce Tempest cease.<br>  And when the Morn shall spread with dawning Day<br>  Her Purple Loom, and shoot her early ray,<br>  You'll <i> Thule</i>  and th' <i> Orcadian</i>  Isles descry<br>  Which scatter'd o'er the Ocean's bosom ly.<br>  Then steer directly to <i> Pomona</i> 's Shore,<br>  Where you will Terrors meet unknown before.<br>  Fear not this Isle and Dangers yet untry'd,<br>  Heav'n you invoke, and Heav'n will be your guide.<br>  Know, that the Prince of Hell has leave obtain'd<br>  To prove your Constancy, and now unchain'd,<br>  Th' Apostate with excessive Rage prepares<br>  His fiery Tryals, and his various Snares.<br>  That he in this great Combate may prevail,<br>  He'll bring the Pious <i> Arthur</i>  to Assail<br>  Prodigious Monsters all of dreadful Shape,<br>  From whom few Heros e'er did yet escape.<br>  When you to Combate these shall take the Field,<br>  Assume your Heav'nly Sword and

will fresh Vigor give,<br>  Your drooping Spirits cheer, and wasted Strength revive.<br>  But when your Arms Hell's Terrors have repell'd<br>  And with immortal praise fierce Monsters quell'd:<br>  Your Chiefest Danger still remains behind,<br>  From a fair Foe, who Murders while she's kind.<br>  A fatal Foe, <i> Fascinia</i>  is her name,<br>  Whose Triumphs Vanquish'd Kings and Chiefs

Win the Field.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, and strait the Seraph disappear'd<br>  King <i> Arthur</i>  with his Looks and Language cheer'd,<br>  Waiting th' appearance of approaching Day<br>  Resolv'd the Heav'nly Vision to obey.<br>  Th' Aerial <i> Demons</i>  from the Seraph fly<br>  Born off on rapid Whirlwinds from the Sky.<br>  The Winds no more insult the flying Waves,<br>  But for repose retreat to Neighb'ring Caves.<br>  The Sea subsides, and on its peaceful breast<br>  Billows diffus'd dispose themselves to rest.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now did the beauteous Morn serenely rise<br>  And open'd with her Smiles the Eastern Skys.<br>  The perfect Day ensu'd, when midst the Seas<br>  They had in view the clust'ring <i> Orcades</i> .<br>  Direct to make <i> Pomona</i> 's Isle they steer'd,<br>  Which near and easy of access appear'd.<br>  Soon did the <i> Britons</i>  see a peaceful Bay<br>  To guard their Ships her spacious Arms display.<br>  Where weary Billows did securely sleep<br>  Withdrawn to shun the Tumults of the Deep.<br>  Within the winding Shores they safely past<br>  Took in their Sails, and all their Anchors cast.<br>  A Chosen Band of <i> Britons</i>  went on Shore<br>  Who might Refreshments and Sufficient Store<br>  Of fresh Provisions for the Navy gain,<br>  Worn with their mighty suff'rings on the Main.<br>  Where many Nights and Days they had been lost<br>  Before the Men descry'd <i> Pomona</i> 's Coast.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  in Person did the Men Command,<br>  Who from their Vessels leap'd out on the Strand,<br>  And boldly thence march'd up to view the Land.<br>  When in the neighb'ring Mountains did appear.<br>  Wild Swine and Goats and Herds of Fallow Deer.<br>  Their fatal Arms did the wild Game pursue,<br>  And soon abundant Store there Weapons slew.<br>  Then laden with their Spoil they turn'd their feet<br>  And came rejoycing to th' expecting Fleet.<br>  In foaming Caldrons some fat Venson boil'd,<br>  They Roasted some, and some on Coals they broil'd.<br>  Spread on the Shore they did themselves refresh,<br>  And prais'd the Swine and Deer's delicious Flesh.<br>  When they had eat and drank with toil opprest<br>  The Men dispos'd their weary Limbs to rest.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as the tender Morn began to dawn,<br>  King <i> Arthur</i>  for Devotion was withdrawn.<br>  While he his humble Prayers was offering up<br>  To Heav'n upon a Neighb'ring Mountain's top,<br>  The Prince of Darkness caught him up on high,<br>  And bore th' undaunted Hero thro' the Sky,<br>  But near a Mountain in a lonesom wast,<br>  Swiftly alighting, he the <i> Briton</i>  plac't.<br>  A mighty Dragon came down from the Hill<br>  Whose hideous Crys did all the Valley fill.<br>  The monstrous Beast was of prodigious size,<br>  Smoak from his Nostrils broke, Fire from his Eyes.<br>  His odious Feet resembled Harpys Claws,<br>  And the fierce <i> Crocadile</i> 's his bloody Jaws.<br>  Which when expanded did three murth'ring Rows<br>  Of Teeth his native Armory disclose.<br>  His Wings spread out o'ershadow'd all the Air,<br>  Wide as the broadest Sails in Ships of War.<br>  Hard scaly Armour to his Body grew<br>  For Ornament and for Protection too.<br>  Along he drew his mighty poisonous train<br>  Like crooked Rivers sliding thro' a plain.<br>  As on the ground the turgid Volumes rol'd,<br>  They all their Speckled Terrors did unfold.<br>  On did the vast, voracious Monster come<br>  With dreadful noise, denouncing <i> Arthur</i> 's Doom.<br>  Sometimes like heavy Bustards rais'd with pain<br>  He flew, and sometimes ran upon the Plain.<br>  Sometimes employing Feet and Pinions too,<br>  The Dragon both together ran and flew.<br>  The Beast with horrid noise advancing near,<br>  Th' undaunted <i> Briton</i>  pois'd his massy Spear<br>  Which strait projected with prodigious Might,<br>  From his strong Arm took his auspicious Flight.<br>  Dragon and Spear against each other hist,<br>  Nor could the Beast this stress of Death resist.<br>  For while he yawn'd and belch'd out dreadful Flames<br>  Amidst the Air in long impetuous Streams,<br>  Down his wide throat the Spear its passage made<br>  And buried deep within his Stomach staid.<br>  Down fell the wounded Beast with mighty sound,<br>  Shook all the Plain, the Woods, and Hills around,<br>  And beat his quivering Wings upon the ground.<br>  A Sea of loathsome Gore resembling Blood,<br>  Sprung from his Throat, and o'er the Region flow'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did the raging Prince of Darkness bear<br>  Aloft the Conquering <i> Briton</i>  thro' the Air.<br>  But set him down amidst a shady Wood,<br>  Which in a wild, amazing Desart stood.<br>  Where only ancient Pines, and baleful Yew,<br>  Unwholsome Box, and mournful Cypress grew.<br>  The noxious Glebe did nothing else produce<br>  But poisonous Flowers, and Herbs of Magic use.<br>  Bald Toadstools, Henbane, Nightshade, Hemlock here,<br>  Abundant choice of Mischief, did appear.<br>  The Birds obscene which love the Shades of Night<br>  Frightful to hear, and odious to the Sight,<br>  Owls, Ravens, Bats, and all th' ill-boding Race<br>  Increast the Horrors of the dismal place.<br>  So black the Shade, so thick the stagnant Air,<br>  That no reviving Sunbeams enter'd there.<br>  Nothing but here and there a straggling Ray<br>  Which lost it self in wandring from the Day.<br>  Which serv'd not to Refresh, but to affright,<br>  Not to Dispel, but to Disclose the Night.<br>  Within the midst an antient Castle stood,<br>  Encompass'd with a Mote of reeking Blood.<br>  Wherein a dreadful Monster did reside,<br>  Who all th' attempts of humane Force defy'd:<br>  A Cruel Tyrant, of Infernal Shape,<br>  Whom none, who Fear her fury, can escape.<br>  Vipers, like those in <i> Stygian</i>  Caverns found,<br>  Swoln with black Gore, her meagre Temples crown'd.<br>  Her ghastly Eyes were sunk within her head,<br>  And Death-like Paleness did her Cheeks o'erspred.<br>  Her long, lank Breasts she o'er her Shoulders flung,<br>  Or to her Wast the loathsom Burden hung.<br>  Her shapeless Form no Words have force to tell,<br>  Black as the Night, and Horrible as Hell.<br>  The Monsters which <i> Sicilia</i> 's Seas defame<br>  If this appear'd, would gentle seem and tame.<br>  She brandish'd in her hand a poison'd Dart,<br>  Which Strikes desponding Mortals to the Heart. <br>  Fast in the festring wound the Weapon rests,<br>  And tears with pain their miserable Breasts.<br>  For death in vain the tortur'd Wretches cry,<br>  Still do they Live, but still they Live to Dy.<br>  None but the Brave conscious of Vertuous Deeds;<br>  Whose Courage from their Innocence proceeds,<br>  Are able to withstand her dreadful Power,<br>  The rest the Monster do's with Ease devour.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner in th' enchanted Wood appear'd<br>  <i> Britannia</i> 's Pious King, but straight he heard<br>  The saddest Accents, deep despairing Sighs,<br>  Bitter Complaints, and loud amazing Crys,<br>  Promiscuous Howlings, lamentable Moans,<br>  Outrageous Sorrow, and redoubled Groans.<br>  Clashing of Whips, hissings of mighty Snakes,<br>  Clancking of Chains, and noise of tort'ring Racks.<br>  Yellings of raging Furys, and the cry<br>  Of Men in dreadful Torments rend the Sky.<br>  Then thro' the Air Flashes of Light'ning past,<br>  And flaming Firebrands at his head were cast.<br>  Dragons of Fire flew swiftly thro' the Air,<br>  And ruddy Meteors shook their blazing Hair.<br>  Then murd'ring Ruffians leap'd out from the Wood,<br>  And grasping bloody Daggers threat'ning stood.<br>  Hell-hounds of hideous Forms, and dreadful Claws<br>  Ran roaring on him with their open Jaws.<br>  Pale shiv'ring Ghosts past groaning by, a sight<br>  Which humane Nature cannot but affright.<br>  These various Horrors did he see and hear<br>  Yet stood unmov'd, and ignorant of Fear.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Darkness all enrag'd to see<br>  The pious King's unshaken Constancy.<br>  To see him midst such Terrors fearless stand,<br>  Grasping his Heavenly Buckler in his Hand;<br>  Wherewith the Hero did with Ease repel<br>  The Rage of all th' united Powers of Hell;<br>  Invited dire <i> Anelpis</i>  to his Aid,<br>  Of whom both Men and Angels are afraid.<br>  Aloud th' Apostate call'd, and at his Cry<br>  The Castle's Brazen Gates did open fly.<br>  The Draw-bridge all with Plates of Iron wrought<br>  Fell down, and lay across the Bloody Moat.<br>  When from the Castle Gates a hideous Rout<br>  With mighty Noise and Outcrys issued out.<br>  The Marks and all the ghastly Shapes of Fear<br>  In their distracted Faces did appear.<br>  Consummate Horror all their Looks possest,<br>  And Consternation not to be exprest.<br>  They beat their Breast, and tortur'd with Despair<br>  Tore from their Heads their stiff erected Hair.<br>  Torrents of Tears they pour'd out from their Eyes,<br>  And fill'd the ecchoing Wood with dismal Crys.<br>  Then next the Hellish Fury came in Sight,<br>  And call'd forth all her Terrors to affright.<br>  She shook her Vipers, and aloud she roar'd<br>  Than Death more cruel, and as Hell abhorr'd.<br>  With horrid Port the meagre Monster strode,<br>  Poising her poison'd Dart all stain'd with Blood.<br>  Up to the King she march'd with furious Hast,<br>  And at his Breast her dreadful Dart she cast.<br>  Off from his temper'd Shield the Weapon glanc'd,<br>  The King with God-like Courage strait advanc'd,<br>  And brandishing his Fauchion in the Air<br>  T' attack the grisly Fury did prepare.<br>  Who straitway fled with all her

ravishing to Sight.<br>  Here did <i> Fascinia</i>  with her wanton train<br>  In unmolested Peace and Pleasure reign.<br>  Her Form was lovely, and amazing fair<br>  Her Looks so sweet, so tender was
