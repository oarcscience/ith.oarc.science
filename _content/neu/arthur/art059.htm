Never glad<br>    Was he with sweetness of his lady's eyes,<br> 	Nor joy he had.<br> <br> But, unloved ever, still must love the same,<br>    And riding ever through a lonely world,<br> Whene'er on adverse shield or crest he came,<br>    Against the danger desperately hurled,<br> 	Crying her name.<br> <br> So I, who strove to You I may not earn,<br>    Methinks, am come unto so high a place,<br> That though from hence I can but vainly yearn<br>    For that averted favour of your face,<br> 	I shall not turn.<br> <br> No, I am come too high.  Whate'er betide,<br>    To find the doubtful thing that fights with me,<br> Toward the mountain tops I still shall ride,<br>    And cry your name in my extremity,<br> 	As Palomyde,<br> <br> Until the issue come.  Will it disclose<br>    No gift of grace, no pity made complete,<br> After much labour done,--much war with woes?<br>    Will you deny me still in Heaven, my sweet;--<br> 	Ah, Death--who knows?<br>
