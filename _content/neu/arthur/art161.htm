 now were holy pilgrimage to pass<br>  Where leaf laps leaf, and bough with bough hath kissed,<br>  Well might it pause:  so murmurous is the grass--<br>  So deep--so thick!--Sir Lancelot by the meres,<br>  Hears the wild waters roaring in his ears.<br>  <br>  For all life sings, and singing it sucks down<br>  The noble heart of Arthur's noblest knight;<br>  A little soulless faun hath willed him drown<br>  Deep, deep in mounting waves of Spring delight.<br>  "O Lancelot," sigh the branches overhead,<br>  "Come rest awhile:  the Grail is not in sight."<br>  "O Lancelot," lisp the grasses, "make thy bed<br>  Here on the kindly earth;  forget renown<br>  And thy sick soul of all but dream discrown."<br>  <br>  Sir Lancelot lieth in the lone green-wood,<br>  Sir Lancelot wrestleth in the tall grass-spears:<br>  Fain would he think upon the Holy Rood,<br>  And Christ's red cup, and sweet Saint Mary's tears;<br>  But then come memories of the balmy lips<br>  And the soft eyelids that are Guinevere's--<br>  He dreams, and as he dreams, wild apple dips<br>  Her brooding boughs, and flowers of milk and blood<br>  Between his strong convuls&egrave;d heart and God.<br>  <br>  And times he saith:  "Why must man aye forego?<br>  And why is life a nobler thing through pain?"<br>  And times:  "Since love's sweet apple hangs so low,<br>  Shall I not strongly grasp and count it gain?"<br>  And thousand times he yearneth for the Grail,<br>  And God's own blood to cleanse his life from stain;<br>  And prays against his love to no avail.<br>  Love's immortality hath root in woe:<br>  All human tragedies do prove it so.<br>  <br>  Three cups of life are proffered to his taste:<br>  One is the chalice of forbidden bliss;<br>  But though his lonely spirit lieth waste<br>  In wish thereof, he is too great for this.<br>  One is the chalice of the San Gra&auml;l:<br>  For this he is too base:  no lip may kiss<br>  The cup wherefrom the pure apostles all<br>  Drank, when their loving Saviour blessed it last,<br>  Save that of meekest men, and maidens chaste.<br>  <br>  One cup is left to him:  the cup of pain.<br>  O bitter wine!  can life be nourished so?<br>  Pain and renouncement ever;  these remain<br>  When vision is all too high, and dream too low.<br>  Drink deep, Sir Lancelot, this draught is blest;<br>  Then back to Camelot through young April go;<br>  Though thou hast failed upon a higher quest,<br>  Yet none the less God's chalice shalt thou drain,<br>  And in thine ear the faun will pipe in vain.<br>  <br>  But who shall glimpse the Holy Grail of God?<br>  Not Lancelot, bravest man, and sternest knight,<br>  Nor Tristram, nor the hundred more who rode<br>  From Camelot gates that April morning bright.<br>  Yet Galahad still trusteth in his heart,<br>  And of the mystic chalice hopeth sight;<br>  In fast and prayer his days are spent apart;<br>  And wheresoe'er his step hath touched the sod<br>  Spring lily-tuft and angus-castus bud.<br>  <br>  Hardby his chapel-cave a blasted thorn<br>  Withdrew in pain from earth its roots accurst:<br>  Long leafless years in agony outworn,<br>  Had left it lone, and naked, and athirst,<br>  With limbs that evermore did rot and twist;<br>  And none to pass that way at even durst;<br>  But Galahad beholding, thought:  "The Christ<br>  On some such wood as this was sure up-borne."<br>  And prayed among its shadows night and morn.<br>  <br>  Now as he kneeleth underneath the spray,<br>  One cometh stumbling like a hunted beast<br>  That all day long hath kept the hounds at bay,<br>  And falleth blindly on a place of rest.<br>  With hands that grasp the tree this other lies<br>  Like some new growth of its contorted breast;<br>  But can wood breathe or hath it anguished eyes?<br>  And Galahad for pity cannot pray,<br>  Nor "Rise thou noble knight" to Lancelot say.<br>  <br>  But from an incorrupted heart he cries:<br>  "O Christ Who camest not to call the just<br>  But sinners, and for them did'st agonise;<br>  Bethink Thee man was moulded out of dust,<br>  Nor lay this sin unto my brother's charge."<br>  Again he cries with tears:  "In Thee I trust!"<br>  And eyes through fast and vigil over-large<br>  He raiseth meekly to the evening skies,<br>  As he would pierce the floors of paradise.<br>  <br>  Behold!  those glorious clouds above the wood<br>  Are stirred with pinions of an angel-quire,<br>  And in their midst, the Chalice of the Blood<br>  The blessed Grail of Galahad's desire.<br>  Impelled and pressed by deathless charity,<br>  Bathes men and angels with a bloom of fire,<br>  Wherein the holy seraphs move, and dye<br>  More deeply red their vesture crimson-hued,<br>  Baptising all things from its burning flood.<br>  <br>  O blessed are the pure!  They shall not fail<br>  To see the Lord their God as in a glass;<br>  Their souls have eyes, their flesh is but a veil--<br>  Thus Galahad found grace above.  Alas<br>  For Arthur's greatest lying at his feet!<br>  The faun is shrivelled like a wisp of grass,<br>  Withered by passage of the Paraclete,<br>  When Lancelot lifteth up his forehead pale--<br>  Sir Lancelot hath not seen the Holy Grail.<br>
