In marvellous stead<br>  Of thronging faces, with looks stern and dread,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dense dust, the hostile plumes above,<br>  <br>  He saw his fair, lost Iseult's passionate eyes,<br>  And o'er the crash of lances heard her cries,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrill with despair, when last they twain did part.<br>  <br>  While others thrilled to strife, he, thrilled with woe,<br>  Felt his life-currents shuddering cold and low<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the worn bastions of his broken heart.<br>  <br>  Then rolled his way the battle's furious flood;<br>  Squadrons charged on him blindly; blows and blood<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showered down like hail and water; vainly drew<br>  <br>  The whole war round him; still his broadsword's gleam<br>  Flashed in death's front, and still, as wrapped in dream,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fought and slew, witting not whom he slew,<br>  <br>  Nor knew whose arm had smitten him deep and sore--<br>  So deep that Tristam never, never more<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone in the van of conflict; but the smart<br>  <br>  Of his fierce wound tortured him night and day,<br>  Till, through God's grace, his life-blood ebbed away,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And death's sweet quiet healed his broken heart.<br>
