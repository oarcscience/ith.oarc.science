Was he dull,<br>    And drank that philtre of sweet sound in vain,<br> That thus he looked away, nor cared to lull<br>    The divine longing of love's hunger-pain<br> By feeding in her eyes his love with love?<br>    He saw not,--no! Nor, though he stared amain,<br> Saw he the banners blazoned bright above<br>    The starry ceilure. Not until the stir<br> After the song, when all the guests 'gan move,<br>    Did her true lover think to look at her.<br> <br> And then, pardie, her eyes were otherwhere:<br>    For lo, past truncheoned steward and cellarer<br> Who stood beside the cupboard, mazed with care<br>    Of the great goblets and the cups of state,<br> Limped Tronc the jester, with a Kaiser's air,<br>    His kingly train upborne by an ape sedate,<br> And four white poodles, two on either side,<br>    Marching upright, but sad, as if the fate<br> Of courtier-life bore hardly on their pride,<br>    And those gay silken masquer weeds they wore<br> Repaid not half what they must needs abide<br>    As hangers-on to majesty so poor.<br> Long laughter shook the hall at that strange show,<br>    Which waxed amain when on the lower floor<br> The motley knave, with many a mop and mow,<br>    Bade all his four-foot courtiers dance and leap,<br> Just as a king might bid his dukes do so.<br>    The feasters laughed and drank, and they drank deep<br> Of those tall flagons, and the butler's wand<br>    Waved for fresh vintage with a lordly sweep.<br> <br> Ginevra raught a wine-flask from the stand<br>    Brimmed with the ripest, and at Arthur's knee<br> Knelt, a deep beaker in her dainty hand,<br>    Gemmed all within with jewels that make flee<br> All taint and venom from the faery brim,<br>    And humbly proffered her new lord. But he,<br> Shamed that such service should be done to him<br>    By her who was his worship, bade her rise.<br> "Nay," quoth the Sire, "fair knight, in life and limb<br>    We are all thine--Let be, the girl is wise."<br> Then Arthur drank and gave her back the cup;<br>    But still she knelt beside him, and her eyes<br> Betrayed no signal as she raised them up<br>    Of woman's art in the child's artlessness,<br> As if she wondered how her lord should sup.<br> <br>    Yet inly knew she all her loveliness:<br> The pilch of velvet, parted white and blue,<br>    Reversed with ermines for an emperess,<br> All overt on the sides, where shimmered through<br>    The kirtle's silken warp with weft of gold<br> From looms of Baldack--O, full well she knew<br>    The needled broidery wrought on every fold--<br> Those smiling suns above and sunflowers three<br>    Under each sun, with faces broad and bold<br> Staring upon him through their greenery<br>    Of sheeny leafage; all along the hem<br> <i> A rienz plus bas jeo ne me tourne mie</i> <br>    Figured in umber, and on every stem<br> <i> Solleil m'attire</i>  on scroll of argent grain--<br>    The glistening girdle brooched with pearl and gem,<br> The gipciere silver-guarded and its chain,<br>    The coronal of gold and golden net--<br> Full well she knew she wore them not in vain,<br>    But knew no less herself was mightier yet.<br> The joyous witchcraft of her sunny hair,<br>    The spell of eyes that dimmed the eyes they met,<br> Even the sigh that half betrayed how fair<br>    The rosy promise of the imperial breast,<br> Guising an art to tell how, pillowed there,<br>    Her love, the sovran of the world, might rest<br> In empire sweeter than the sway of kings.<br>    So, for the night was waxing, host and guest<br> Betook them to their chambers, and the things<br>    Which showed so mighty faded while they slept<br> Utterly even as fond imaginings,<br>    And no man knew that he had laughed or wept.<br> But not forgetful of sweet life they lay,<br>    For each, almost ere midnight tolled, had leapt<br> Forth from his couch to busk him for the day.<br> <br>    Then on the dais a carpet of fine Tars<br> Was spread in hall, where grooms and pages gay,<br>    With tapers twinkling under the gold stars,<br> Lighted the bare-armed, leathern-aproned band<br>    Who cased us in our harness for the wars.<br> And 'mid the clang, a squire on either hand,<br>    Came Arthur's self, and on the carpet doffed<br> His mantle blue of cloth of Samarcand,<br>    Unhasped the jewelled girdle, and aloft<br> Lifted the velvet coat, and set aside<br>    The banded shoon of cheveril white and soft.<br> Then stately through high hall in seemly pride,<br>    Among the clashing press, that Peerless One<br> Stepped with such gait as might beseem the bride<br>    Of empire peerless underneath the sun.<br> Yet to her lord right maidenly she spake,<br>    Bidding good morrow: "Nay," quoth she, "by none<br> Save mine own hands, sweet Sire, for knighthood's sake<br>    Shalt thou be armed this day."--With that she set<br> Upon the kingly cycladoun of lake<br>    The hacketon all lined with sarcinet,<br> Orfreyed without with crescents of thin gold<br>    Upon the buckskin; next the solleret<br> She fitted on each foot with fold on fold<br>    Of overlapping steel and toe-piece keen,<br> Like scale and sting of hornet; next in hold<br>    She locked his thews in greaves of damasked sheen<br> Of Milan; next the cuisses featously<br>    She hasped upon his thigh, and fair between<br> Buckled the knee-piece underneath the knee;<br>    Vambrace and brassart next, and elbow-plate<br> As squire who knew full well where each should be<br>    Upon his arms she jointed in due state,<br> And shelled the shoulders in their silver scale.<br>    Then, o'er the pourpoint, heeding not the weight,<br> Deftly she donned the jesseraunt of mail;<br>    And over that, the jupon, blazoned fair<br> With fiery dragon swindging his huge tail,<br>    And broidered bordure, wrought in leafage rare<br> Of braided strands of silk incarnadine.<br>    Then on the golden glory of his hair<br> With gentle stedfast hand and earnest eyne,<br>    As if she offered up a kingly gift<br> With solemn pageant at a saintly shrine,<br>    With arms upstretched before him did she lift<br> The bascinet all burnished, rich inlaid<br>    With golden damask, then with fingers swift<br> Made fast the fringe of camail fair displayed;<br>    Drew on the gauntlets with their gadlings gilt<br> And tasseled hems with knotted silk arrayed;<br>    And kneeling then, the spurs he won in tilt<br> On the first day he armed him, on his heel<br>    She set and buckled. Deftly thus she built<br> Around her love that sheeny tower of steel.--<br>    But more was wanting. Still upon one knee<br> Beside her new lord did the proud one kneel,<br>    And from the blushing page took reverently<br> The faery wonder of Escalibor<br>    With all its wealth of jewelled wizardry<br> Wherewith to gird her knightly bachelor:<br>    Baldrick and hilt and scabbard--not a gem<br> But flashed with virtue for a conqueror:--<br>    This ruby once on Judith's diadem<br> Blazed like a star--that diamond clasp of yore<br>    Girdled the Wise King in Jerusalem:<br> Yet all not worthier than the blade they bore,<br>    Forged in the caverns of the Enchanted Lake<br> By Weland, snapped and forged again thrice o'er,<br>    Graven with names whereat the foul fiends quake<br> In potent rune and mystic sign enscrolled;<br>    Then for the first time did the fair hand shake,<br> Yet tongued the buckle smoothly on the fold<br>    And the rich ends in a loose knot let fall.<br> <br> So rose she, proudly smiling to behold<br>    Her knight and king, how comely and how tall<br> He showed in that fair labour of her hand.<br>    Yea, and beside her others smiled in hall;<br> For watching the sweet pair anigh did stand<br>    Her sire and Merlin, with such thoughts as stir<br> Old hearts at sight of young love, 'mid a band<br>    Of gaping losels, page and armourer.<br> <br> Then spake old Merlin with his sour-sweet smile,<br>    By name to Arthur, but as much to her:--<br> "Fair sir, in Logress, in the minster-aisle<br>    Of sweet Saint Stephen erst thou didst receive<br> At pious Dubric's hand the name and style<br>    Of a true knight, but now thou wouldst achieve<br> A dearer honour--now almost 'tis thine<br>    To be love-knighted. By this lady's leave<br> One thing alone is lacking."--Her full eyne<br>    Ginevra flashed upon that wizard grey,<br> As Arthur asked: "What lacketh, master mine?<br>    No rite shall fail my chivalry this day<br> From whence I date my knighthood, for till this<br>    I have but jested." Then quoth Merlin: "Nay,<br> 'Tis but a trifle--let the lady kiss,<br>    And thou, fair sir, art knight for evermore!"<br> "Sweet Sire," quoth she, "King Arthur shall not miss<br>    For gift so small his knighthood. If my lore<br> Be nothing in this matter, pardon me:<br>    Yet as to kisses, I am not so poor<br> That I can spare none." Then full maidenly<br>    Her rosy lips she lifted to her lord<br> And kissed him in all stateliness; but he<br>    Caught her in both arms and without a word<br> Repaid the kiss thrice o'er and thrice to boot.<br>    O, but no rune nor gem on belt nor sword<br> Could stay the trembling that from head to foot<br>    Shook the new knight in that encounter sweet,<br> No harness ward the wound from his heart's root.<br>    So kissed those lovers. Fleet and few, how fleet,<br> How few, from the first cradle to the last,<br>    Those high eternal moments! O, the beat<br> Within their pulses made our own beat fast<br>    And dimmed our eyes with pity and regret.<br> Or do we now grow old, and fondly cast<br>    A sadness on the joy we half forget,<br> Clouding with sorrows of our eld the youth<br>    We do remember to remember yet?<br> We know not now. But even thus in sooth<br>    Those lovers kissed, and we who saw them kiss<br> Look back and see them still with such deep ruth<br>    As maketh old men weep at sight of bliss;--<br> Still feel the whisper which we could not hear:<br>    "All eyes are staring--loose me after this."<br> So slipped she from his arms with gracious cheer,<br>    Ruddy for maiden shame, yet not the less<br> Proud, not alone of her own knight sans peer,<br>    But proud that all should see that fond caress.<br> Then Arthur turned as one but half awake,<br>    Drunken with that deep draught of loveliness,<br> Dazed with his dreams of conquest for her sake<br>    And bliss to be. But when his eye did light<br> On her sad-smiling sire, a flush 'gan break<br>    Into his brow, with love's own wanness white;<br> And when beyond he felt the glittering blue<br>    Of Merlin's eye, he crimsoned through outright;<br> For well that bridegroom knew that Merlin knew<br>    His lawless other love and its wild sin--<br> Sin unto death, even though all else be true.<br> <br>    But Merlin spake: "Hereafter thou shalt win<br> Glory undying, such as never yet<br>    Was e'er achieved by prince or paladin.<br> Yea, there be mighty names that men forget,<br>    And all our life is but a little space,<br> And soon we shall lie still for all our fret.<br>    Our day is short, and night comes on apace,<br> And then we shall not know sorrow nor bliss,<br>    Nor toil nor rest, nor recollect the face<br> Of man nor woman. Yet by that sweet kiss<br>    To the world's end men shall remember thee!<br> They shall remember, yea, and more than this:<br>    King thou art now, and king again shalt be<br> Hereafter in this land of Bloy Bretayne;<br>    For though thou go away, and shalt be free<br> No less than others from the toil and pain,<br>    Thou shalt not die as others, nor the years<br> Shall waste no glory of thy secret reign<br>    In realm of Faery, whence among thy peers<br> Thou shalt return to rule in sight of all<br>    That shall have eyes to see thee through their tears<br> Of joy that after so long interval<br>    Their own King Arthur doth come back to men."<br> <br> So Merlin spake, and we, who stood in hall,<br>    Were mute for musing. But Ginevra then<br> As one whom joy and doubt at once o'erwhelm,<br>    Hearing how he, her lord, should come agen,<br> Yet nought of her, the lady of his realm--<br>    Stepped forth once more and with firm hand did don<br> Over the knight's steel cap the kingly helm,<br>    Windowed and pranked with gold, and thereupon<br> A chaplet wrought with leaf of lily and vine,<br>    Beaten in gold--a Jew's-work pentagon<br> Under each foil, inwrought with subtle twine<br>    Of stones of empire on the sheeny rim.<br> Then Merlin came, saying: "The last is mine,"<br>    And set above the helm a crest to dim<br> All gold and gemwork flash they as they might;<br>    The Dragon-royal, through whose every limb<br> The lifeblood beat in pulses of quick light;<br>    Yet stirred it not, save that its snaky tail<br> It curled in glancing folds, and fiery bright<br>    It breathed a flame, red-mirrored in the mail.<br> <br> So strode the King full kingly to the gate,<br>    Where in gay trappings o'er the burnished scale<br> Bridged by the saddle, his tall steed did wait<br>    And neighed to greet his monarch as he strode<br> And swung into the stirrups in all state.<br>    Sadly those lovers each bade each to God;<br> For glory is sweet but love is loth to go;<br>    And through the strait lane clattering forth we rode<br> With folded gonfanons and lances low.<br>
