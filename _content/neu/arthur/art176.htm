A slender-shafted Pine<br>  Lost footing, fell, and so was whirled away.<br>  "How he went down," said Gareth, "as a false knight<br>  Or evil king before my lance if lance<br>  Were mine to use--O senseless cataract,<br>  Bearing all down in thy precipitancy--<br>  And yet thou art but swollen with cold snows<br>  And mine is living blood; thou dost His will,<br>  The Maker's, and not knowest, and I that know,<br>  Have strength and wit, in my good mother's hall<br>  Linger with vacillating obedience,<br>  Prisoned, and kept and coaxed and whistled to--<br>  Since the good mother holds me still a child!<br>  Good mother is bad mother unto me!<br>  A worse were better; yet no worse would I.<br>  Heaven yield her for it, but in me put force<br>  To weary her ears with one continuous prayer,<br>  Until she let me fly discaged to sweep<br>  In ever-highering eagle-circles up<br>  To the great Sun of Glory, and thence swoop<br>  Down upon all things base, and dash them dead,<br>  A knight of Arthur, working out his will,<br>  To cleanse the world.  Why, Gawain, when he came<br>  With Modred hither in the summertime,<br>  Asked me to tilt with him, the proven knight.<br>  Modred for want of worthier was the judge.<br>  Then I so shook him in the saddle, he said,<br>  'Thou hast half prevailed against me,' said so--he--<br>  Though Modred biting his thin lips was mute,<br>  For he is alway sullen: what care I?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth went, and hovering round her chair<br>  Asked, "Mother, though ye count me still the child,<br>  Sweet mother, do ye love the child?" She laughed,<br>  "Thou art but a wild-goose to question it."<br>  "Then, mother, an ye love the child," he said,<br>  "Being a goose and rather tame than wild,<br>  Hear the child's story."  "Yea, my well-beloved,<br>  An 'twere but of the goose and golden eggs."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,<br>  "Nay, nay, good mother, but this egg of mine<br>  Was finer gold than any goose can lay;<br>  For this an Eagle, a royal Eagle, laid<br>  Almost beyond eye-reach, on such a palm<br>  As glitters gilded in thy Book of Hours.<br>  And there was ever haunting round the palm<br>  A lusty youth, but poor, who often saw<br>  The splendour sparkling from aloft, and thought<br>  'An I could climb and lay my hand upon it,<br>  Then were I wealthier than a leash of kings,'<br>  But ever when he reached a hand to climb,<br>  One, that had loved him from his childhood, caught<br>  And stayed him, 'Climb not lest thou break thy neck,<br>  I charge thee by my love,' and so the boy,<br>  Sweet mother, neither clomb, nor brake his neck,<br>  But brake his very heart in pining for it.<br>  And past away."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the mother said,<br>  "True love, sweet son, had risked himself and climbed,<br>  And handed down the golden treasure to him."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,<br>  "Gold? said I gold?--ay then, why he, or she,<br>  Or whosoe'er it was, or half the world<br>  Had ventured--<i> had</i>  the thing I spake of been<br>  Mere gold--but this was all of that true steel,<br>  Whereof they forged the brand Excalibur,<br>  And lightnings played about it in the storm,<br>  And all the little fowl were flurried at it,<br>  And there were cries and clashings in the nest,<br>  That sent him from his senses: let me go."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Bellicent bemoaned herself and said,<br>  "Hast thou no pity upon my loneliness?<br>  Lo, where thy father Lot beside the hearth<br>  Lies like a log, and all but smouldered out!<br>  For ever since when traitor to the King<br>  He fought against him in the Barons' war,<br>  And Arthur gave him back his territory,<br>  His age hath slowly droopt, and now lies there<br>  A yet-warm corpse, and yet unburiable,<br>  No more; nor sees, nor hears, nor speaks, nor knows.<br>  And both thy brethren are in Arthur's hall,<br>  Albeit neither loved with that full love<br>  I feel for thee, nor worthy such a love:<br>  Stay therefore thou; red berries charm the bird,<br>  And thee, mine innocent, the jousts, the wars,<br>  Who never knewest finger-ache, nor pang<br>  Of wrenched or broken limb--an often chance<br>  In those brain-stunning shocks, and tourney-falls,<br>  Frights to my heart; but stay: follow the deer<br>  By these tall firs and our fast-falling burns;<br>  So make thy manhood mightier day by day;<br>  Sweet is the chase: and I will seek thee out<br>  Some comfortable bride and fair, to grace<br>  Thy climbing life, and cherish my prone year,<br>  Till falling into Lot's forgetfulness<br>  I know not thee, myself, nor anything.<br>  Stay, my best son! ye are yet more boy than man."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gareth, "An ye hold me yet for child,<br>  Hear yet once more the story of the child.<br>  For, mother, there was once a King, like ours.<br>  The prince his heir, when tall and marriageable,<br>  Asked for a bride; and thereupon the King<br>  Set two before him.  One was fair, strong, armed--<br>  But to be won by force--and many men<br>  Desired her; one, good lack, no man desired.<br>  And these were the conditions of the King:<br>  That save he won the first by force, he needs<br>  Must wed that other, whom no man desired,<br>  A red-faced bride who knew herself so vile,<br>  That evermore she longed to hide herself,<br>  Nor fronted man or woman, eye to eye--<br>  Yea--some she cleaved to, but they died of her.<br>  And one--they called her Fame; and one,--O Mother,<br>  How can ye keep me tethered to you--Shame.<br>  Man am I grown, a man's work must I do.<br>  Follow the deer? follow the Christ, the King,<br>  Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King--<br>  Else, wherefore born?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom the mother said,<br>  "Sweet son, for there be many who deem him not,<br>  Or will not deem him, wholly proven King--<br>  Albeit in mine own heart I knew him King,<br>  When I was frequent with him in my youth,<br>  And heard him Kingly speak, and doubted him<br>  No more than he, himself; but felt him mine,<br>  Of closest kin to me: yet--wilt thou leave<br>  Thine easeful biding here, and risk thine all,<br>  Life, limbs, for one that is not proven King?<br>  Stay, till the cloud that settles round his birth<br>  Hath lifted but a little. Stay, sweet son."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth answered quickly, "Not an hour,<br>  So that ye yield me--I will walk through fire,<br>  Mother, to gain it--your full leave to go.<br>  Not proven, who swept the dust of ruined Rome<br>  From off the threshold of the realm, and crushed<br>  The Idolators, and made the people free?<br>  Who should be King save him who makes us free?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the Queen, who long had sought in vain<br>  To break him from the intent to which he grew,<br>  Found her son's will unwaveringly one,<br>  She answered craftily, "Will ye walk through fire?<br>  Who walks through fire will hardly heed the smoke.<br>  Ay, go then, an ye must: only one proof,<br>  Before thou ask the King to make thee knight,<br>  Of thine obedience and thy love to me,<br>  Thy mother,--I demand."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth cried,<br>  "A hard one, or a hundred, so I go.<br>  Nay--quick! the proof to prove me to the quick!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But slowly spake the mother looking at him,<br>  "Prince, thou shalt go disguised to Arthur's hall,<br>  And hire thyself to serve for meats and drinks<br>  Among the scullions and the kitchen-knaves,<br>  And those that hand the dish across the bar.<br>  Nor shalt thou tell thy name to anyone.<br>  And thou shalt serve a twelvemonth and a day."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so the Queen believed that when her son<br>  Beheld his only way to glory lead<br>  Low down through villain kitchen-vassalage,<br>  Her own true Gareth was too princely-proud<br>  To pass thereby; so should he rest with her,<br>  Closed in her castle from the sound of arms.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent awhile was Gareth, then replied,<br>  "The thrall in person may be free in soul,<br>  And I shall see the jousts.  Thy son am I,<br>  And since thou art my mother, must obey.<br>  I therefore yield me freely to thy will;<br>  For hence will I, disguised, and hire myself<br>  To serve with scullions and with kitchen-knaves;<br>  Nor tell my name to any--no, not the King."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gareth awhile lingered.  The mother's eye,<br>  Full of the wistful fear that he would go,<br>  And turning toward him whereso'er he turned,<br>  Perplext his outward purpose, till an hour,<br>  When wakened by the wind which with full voice<br>  Swept bellowing through the darkness on to dawn,<br>  He rose, and out of slumber calling two<br>  That still had tended on him from his birth,<br>  Before the wakeful mother heard him, went.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three were clad like tillers of the soil.<br>  Southward they set their faces.  The birds made<br>  Melody on branch, and melody in mid air,<br>  The damp hill-slopes were quickened into green,<br>  And the live green had kindled into flowers,<br>  For it was past the time of Easterday.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when their feet were planted on the plain<br>  That broadened toward the base of Camelot,<br>  Far off they saw the silver-misty morn<br>  Rolling her smoke about the Royal mount,<br>  That rose between the forest and the field.<br>  At times the summit of the high city flashed;<br>  At times the spires and turrets half-way down<br>  Pricked through the mist; at times the great gate shone<br>  Only, that opened on the field below:<br>  Anon, the whole fair city had disappeared.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then those who went with Gareth were amazed,<br>  One crying, "Let us go no further, lord.<br>  Here is a city of Enchanters, built<br>  By fairy Kings."  The second echoed him,<br>  "Lord, we have heard from our wise man at home<br>  To Northward, that this King is not the King,<br>  But only changeling out of Fairyland,<br>  Who drave the heathen hence by sorcery<br>  And Merlin's glamour."  Then the first again,<br>  "Lord, there is no such city anywhere,<br>  But all a vision."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gareth answered them<br>  With laughter, swearing he had glamour enow<br>  In his own blood, his princedom, youth and hopes,<br>  To plunge old Merlin in the Arabian sea;<br>  So pushed them all unwilling toward the gate.<br>  And there was no gate like it under heaven.<br>  For barefoot on the keystone, which was lined<br>  And rippled like an ever-fleeting wave,<br>  The Lady of the Lake stood: all her dress<br>  Wept from her sides as water flowing away;<br>  But like the cross her great and goodly arms<br>  Stretched under all the cornice and upheld:<br>  And drops of water fell from either hand;<br>  And down from one a sword was hung, from one<br>  A censer, either worn with wind and storm;<br>  And o'er her breast floated the sacred fish;<br>  And in the space to left of her, and right,<br>  Were Arthur's wars in weird devices done,<br>  New things and old co-twisted, as if Time<br>  Were nothing, so inveterately, that men<br>  Were giddy gazing there; and over all<br>  High on the top were those three Queens, the friends<br>  Of Arthur, who should help him at his need.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then those with Gareth for so long a space<br>  Stared at the figures, that at last it seemed<br>  The dragon-boughts and elvish emblemings<br>  Began to move, seethe, twine and curl: they called<br>  To Gareth, "Lord, the gateway is alive."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth likewise on them fixt his eyes<br>  So long, that even to him they seemed to move.<br>  Out of the city a blast of music pealed.<br>  Back from the gate started the three, to whom<br>  From out thereunder came an ancient man,<br>  Long-bearded, saying, "Who be ye, my sons?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gareth, "We be tillers of the soil,<br>  Who leaving share in furrow come to see<br>  The glories of our King: but these, my men,<br>  (Your city moved so weirdly in the mist)<br>  Doubt if the King be King at all, or come<br>  From Fairyland; and whether this be built<br>  By magic, and by fairy Kings and Queens;<br>  Or whether there be any city at all,<br>  Or all a vision: and this music now<br>  Hath scared them both, but tell thou these the truth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then that old Seer made answer playing on him<br>  And saying, "Son, I have seen the good ship sail<br>  Keel upward, and mast downward, in the heavens,<br>  And solid turrets topsy-turvy in air:<br>  And here is truth; but an it please thee not,<br>  Take thou the truth as thou hast told it me.<br>  For truly as thou sayest, a Fairy King<br>  And Fairy Queens have built the city, son;<br>  They came from out a sacred mountain-cleft<br>  Toward the sunrise, each with harp in hand,<br>  And built it to the music of their harps.<br>  And, as thou sayest, it is enchanted, son,<br>  For there is nothing in it as it seems<br>  Saving the King; though some there be that hold<br>  The King a shadow, and the city real:<br>  Yet take thou heed of him, for, so thou pass<br>  Beneath this archway, then wilt thou become<br>  A thrall to his enchantments, for the King<br>  Will bind thee by such vows, as is a shame<br>  A man should not be bound by, yet the which<br>  No man can keep; but, so thou dread to swear,<br>  Pass not beneath this gateway, but abide<br>  Without, among the cattle of the field.<br>  For an ye heard a music, like enow<br>  They are building still, seeing the city is built<br>  To music, therefore never built at all,<br>  And therefore built for ever."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gareth spake<br>  Angered, "Old Master, reverence thine own beard<br>  That looks as white as utter truth, and seems<br>  Wellnigh as long as thou art statured tall!<br>  Why mockest thou the stranger that hath been<br>  To thee fair-spoken?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Seer replied,<br>  "Know ye not then the Riddling of the Bards?<br>  'Confusion, and illusion, and relation,<br>  Elusion, and occasion, and evasion'?<br>  I mock thee not but as thou mockest me,<br>  And all that see thee, for thou art not who<br>  Thou seemest, but I know thee who thou art.<br>  And now thou goest up to mock the King,<br>  Who cannot brook the shadow of any lie."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmockingly the mocker ending here<br>  Turned to the right, and past along the plain;<br>  Whom Gareth looking after said, "My men,<br>  Our one white lie sits like a little ghost<br>  Here on the threshold of our enterprise.<br>  Let love be blamed for it, not she, nor I:<br>  Well, we will make amends."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all good cheer<br>  He spake and laughed, then entered with his twain<br>  Camelot, a city of shadowy palaces<br>  And stately, rich in emblem and the work<br>  Of ancient kings who did their days in stone;<br>  Which Merlin's hand, the Mage at Arthur's court,<br>  Knowing all arts, had touched, and everywhere<br>  At Arthur's ordinance, tipt with lessening peak<br>  And pinnacle, and had made it spire to heaven.<br>  And ever and anon a knight would pass<br>  Outward, or inward to the hall: his arms<br>  Clashed; and the sound was good to Gareth's ear.<br>  And out of bower and casement shyly glanced<br>  Eyes of pure women, wholesome stars of love;<br>  And all about a healthful people stept<br>  As in the presence of a gracious king.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then into hall Gareth ascending heard<br>  A voice, the voice of Arthur, and beheld<br>  Far over heads in that long-vaulted hall<br>  The splendour of the presence of the King<br>  Throned, and delivering doom--and looked no more--<br>  But felt his young heart hammering in his ears,<br>  And thought, "For this half-shadow of a lie<br>  The truthful King will doom me when I speak."<br>  Yet pressing on, though all in fear to find<br>  Sir Gawain or Sir Modred, saw nor one<br>  Nor other, but in all the listening eyes<br>  Of those tall knights, that ranged about the throne,<br>  Clear honour shining like the dewy star<br>  Of dawn, and faith in their great King, with pure<br>  Affection, and the light of victory,<br>  And glory gained, and evermore to gain.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came a widow crying to the King,<br>  "A boon, Sir King! Thy father, Uther, reft<br>  From my dead lord a field with violence:<br>  For howsoe'er at first he proffered gold,<br>  Yet, for the field was pleasant in our eyes,<br>  We yielded not; and then he reft us of it<br>  Perforce, and left us neither gold nor field."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Arthur, "Whether would ye? gold or field?"<br>  To whom the woman weeping, "Nay, my lord,<br>  The field was pleasant in my husband's eye."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Arthur, "Have thy pleasant field again,<br>  And thrice the gold for Uther's use thereof,<br>  According to the years.  No boon is here,<br>  But justice, so thy say be proven true.<br>  Accursed, who from the wrongs his father did<br>  Would shape himself a right!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while she past,<br>  Came yet another widow crying to him,<br>  "A boon, Sir King!  Thine enemy, King, am I.<br>  With thine own hand thou slewest my dear lord,<br>  A knight of Uther in the Barons' war,<br>  When Lot and many another rose and fought<br>  Against thee, saying thou wert basely born.<br>  I held with these, and loathe to ask thee aught.<br>  Yet lo! my husband's brother had my son<br>  Thralled in his castle, and hath starved him dead;<br>  And standeth seized of that inheritance<br>  Which thou that slewest the sire hast left the son.<br>  So though I scarce can ask it thee for hate,<br>  Grant me some knight to do the battle for me,<br>  Kill the foul thief, and wreak me for my son."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then strode a good knight forward, crying to him,<br>  "A boon, Sir King!  I am her kinsman, I.<br>  Give me to right her wrong, and slay the man."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Sir Kay, the seneschal, and cried,<br>  "A boon, Sir King!  even that thou grant her none,<br>  This railer, that hath mocked thee in full hall--<br>  None; or the wholesome boon of gyve and gag."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Arthur, "We sit King, to help the wronged<br>  Through all our realm.  The woman loves her lord.<br>  Peace to thee, woman, with thy loves and hates!<br>  The kings of old had doomed thee to the flames,<br>  Aurelius Emrys would have scourged thee dead,<br>  And Uther slit thy tongue: but get thee hence--<br>  Lest that rough humour of the kings of old<br>  Return upon me!  Thou art her kin,<br>  Go likewise; lay him low and slay him not,<br>  But bring him here, that I may judge the right,<br>  According to the justice of the King:<br>  Then, be he guilty, by that deathless King<br>  Who lived and died for men, the man shall die."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came in hall the messenger of Mark,<br>  A name of evil savour in the land,<br>  The Cornish king.  In either hand he bore<br>  What dazzled all, and shone far-off as shines<br>  A field of charlock in the sudden sun<br>  Between two showers, a cloth of palest gold,<br>  Which down he laid before the throne, and knelt,<br>  Delivering, that his lord, the vassal king,<br>  Was even upon his way to Camelot;<br>  For having heard that Arthur of his grace<br>  Had made his goodly cousin, Tristram, knight,<br>  And, for himself was of the greater state,<br>  Being a king, he trusted his liege-lord<br>  Would yield him this large honour all the more;<br>  So prayed him well to accept this cloth of gold,<br>  In token of true heart and fe&auml;lty.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Arthur cried to rend the cloth, to rend<br>  In pieces, and so cast it on the hearth.<br>  An oak-tree smouldered there.  "The goodly knight!<br>  What! shall the shield of Mark stand among these?"<br>  For, midway down the side of that long hall<br>  A stately pile,--whereof along the front,<br>  Some blazoned, some but carven, and some blank,<br>  There ran a treble range of stony shields,--<br>  Rose, and high-arching overbrowed the hearth.<br>  And under every shield a knight was named:<br>  For this was Arthur's custom in his hall;<br>  When some good knight had done one noble deed,<br>  His arms were carven only; but if twain<br>  His arms were blazoned also; but if none,<br>  The shield was blank and bare without a sign<br>  Saving the name beneath; and Gareth saw<br>  The shield of Gawain blazoned rich and bright,<br>  And Modred's blank as death; and Arthur cried<br>  To rend the cloth and cast it on the hearth.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More like are we to reave him of his crown<br>  Than make him knight because men call him king.<br>  The kings we found, ye know we stayed their hands<br>  From war among themselves, but left them kings;<br>  Of whom were any bounteous, merciful,<br>  Truth-speaking, brave, good livers, them we enrolled<br>  Among us, and they sit within our hall.<br>  But Mark hath tarnished the great name of king,<br>  As Mark would sully the low state of churl:<br>  And, seeing he hath sent us cloth of gold,<br>  Return, and meet, and hold him from our eyes,<br>  Lest we should lap him up in cloth of lead,<br>  Silenced for ever--craven--a man of plots,<br>  Craft, poisonous counsels, wayside ambushings--<br>  No fault of thine: let Kay the seneschal<br>  Look to thy wants, and send thee satisfied--<br>  Accursed, who strikes nor lets the hand be seen!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many another suppliant crying came<br>  With noise of ravage wrought by beast and man,<br>  And evermore a knight would ride away.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, Gareth leaning both hands heavily<br>  Down on the shoulders of the twain, his men,<br>  Approached between them toward the King, and asked,<br>  "A boon, Sir King (his voice was all ashamed),<br>  For see ye not how weak and hungerworn<br>  I seem--leaning on these? grant me to serve<br>  For meat and drink among thy kitchen-knaves<br>  A twelvemonth and a day, nor seek my name.<br>  Hereafter I will fight."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him the King,<br>  "A goodly youth and worth a goodlier boon!<br>  But so thou wilt no goodlier, then must Kay,<br>  The master of the meats and drinks, be thine."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose and past; then Kay, a man of mien<br>  Wan-sallow as the plant that feels itself<br>  Root-bitten by white lichen,<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo ye now!<br>  This fellow hath broken from some Abbey, where,<br>  God wot, he had not beef and brewis enow,<br>  However that might chance! but an he work,<br>  Like any pigeon will I cram his crop,<br>  And sleeker shall he shine than any hog."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lancelot standing near, "Sir Seneschal,<br>  Sleuth-hound thou knowest, and gray, and all the hounds;<br>  A horse thou knowest, a man thou dost not know:<br>  Broad brows and fair, a fluent hair and fine,<br>  High nose, a nostril large and fine, and hands<br>  Large, fair and fine!--Some young lad's mystery--<br>  But, or from sheepcot or king's hall, the boy<br>  Is noble-natured.  Treat him with all grace,<br>  Lest he should come to shame thy judging of him."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Kay, "What murmurest thou of mystery?<br>  Think ye this fellow will poison the King's dish?<br>  Nay, for he spake too fool-like: mystery!<br>  Tut, an the lad were noble, he had asked<br>  For horse and armour: fair and fine, forsooth!<br>  Sir Fine-face, Sir Fair-hands? but see thou to it<br>  That thine own fineness, Lancelot, some fine day<br>  Undo thee not--and leave my man to me."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Gareth all for glory underwent<br>  The sooty yoke of kitchen-vassalage;<br>  Ate with young lads his portion by the door,<br>  And couched at night with grimy kitchen-knaves.<br>  And Lancelot ever spake him pleasantly,<br>  But Kay the seneschal, who loved him not,<br>  Would hustle and harry him, and labour him<br>  Beyond his comrade of the hearth, and set<br>  To turn the broach, draw water, or hew wood,<br>  Or grosser tasks; and Gareth bowed himself<br>  With all obedience to the King, and wrought<br>  All kind of service with a noble ease<br>  That graced the lowliest act in doing it.<br>  And when the thralls had talk among themselves,<br>  And one would praise the love that linkt the King<br>  And Lancelot--how the King had saved his life<br>  In battle twice, and Lancelot once the King's--<br>  For Lancelot was the first in Tournament,<br>  But Arthur mightiest on the battle-field--<br>  Gareth was glad.  Or if some other told,<br>  How once the wandering forester at dawn,<br>  Far over the blue tarns and hazy seas,<br>  On Caer-Eryri's highest found the King,<br>  A naked babe, of whom the Prophet spake,<br>  "He passes to the Isle Avilion,<br>  He passes and is healed and cannot die"--<br>  Gareth was glad.  But if their talk were foul,<br>  Then would he whistle rapid as any lark,<br>  Or carol some old roundelay, and so loud<br>  That first they mocked, but, after, reverenced him.<br>  Or Gareth telling some prodigious tale<br>  Of knights, who sliced a red life-bubbling way<br>  Through twenty folds of twisted dragon, held<br>  All in a gap-mouthed circle his good mates<br>  Lying or sitting round him, idle hands,<br>  Charmed; till Sir Kay, the seneschal, would come<br>  Blustering upon them, like a sudden wind<br>  Among dead leaves, and drive them all apart.<br>  Or when the thralls had sport among themselves,<br>  So there were any trial of mastery,<br>  He, by two yards in casting bar or stone<br>  Was counted best; and if there chanced a joust,<br>  So that Sir Kay nodded him leave to go,<br>  Would hurry thither, and when he saw the knights<br>  Clash like the coming and retiring wave,<br>  And the spear spring, and good horse reel, the boy<br>  Was half beyond himself for ecstasy.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for a month he wrought among the thralls;<br>  But in the weeks that followed, the good Queen,<br>  Repentant of the word she made him swear,<br>  And saddening in her childless castle, sent,<br>  Between the in-crescent and de-crescent moon,<br>  Arms for her son, and loosed him from his vow.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Gareth hearing from a squire of Lot<br>  With whom he used to play at tourney once,<br>  When both were children, and in lonely haunts<br>  Would scratch a ragged oval on the sand,<br>  And each at either dash from either end--<br>  Shame never made girl redder than Gareth joy.<br>  He laughed; he sprang. "Out of the smoke, at once<br>  I leap from Satan's foot to Peter's knee--<br>  These news be mine, none other's--nay, the King's--<br>  Descend into the city;" whereon he sought<br>  The King alone, and found, and told him all.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have staggered thy strong Gawain in a tilt<br>  For pastime; yea, he said it: joust can I.<br>  Make me thy knight--in secret! let my name<br>  Be hidden, and give me the first quest, I spring<br>  Like flame from ashes."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the King's calm eye<br>  Fell on, and checked, and made him flush, and bow<br>  Lowly, to kiss his hand, who answered him,<br>  "Son, the good mother let me know thee here,<br>  And sent her wish that I would yield thee thine.<br>  Make thee my knight? my knights are sworn to vows<br>  Of utter hardihood, utter gentleness,<br>  And, loving, utter faithfulness in love,<br>  And uttermost obedience to the King."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gareth, lightly springing from his knees,<br>  "My King, for hardihood I can promise thee.<br>  For uttermost obedience make demand<br>  Of whom ye gave me to, the Seneschal,<br>  No mellow master of the meats and drinks!<br>  And as for love, God wot, I love not yet,<br>  But love I shall, God willing."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King--<br>  "Make thee my knight in secret? yea, but he,<br>  Our noblest brother, and our truest man,<br>  And one with me in all, he needs must know."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let Lancelot know, my King, let Lancelot know,<br>  Thy noblest and thy truest!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the King--<br>  "But wherefore would ye men should wonder at you?<br>  Nay, rather for the sake of me, their King,<br>  And the deed's sake my knighthood do the deed,<br>  Than to be noised of."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merrily Gareth asked,<br>  "Have I not earned my cake in baking of it?<br>  Let be my name until I make my name!<br>  My deeds will speak: it is but for a day."<br>  So with a kindly hand on Gareth's arm<br>  Smiled the great King, and half-unwillingly<br>  Loving his lusty youthhood yielded to him.<br>  Then, after summoning Lancelot privily,<br>  "I have given him the first quest: he is not proven.<br>  Look therefore when he calls for this in hall,<br>  Thou get to horse and follow him far away.<br>  Cover the lions on thy shield, and see<br>  Far as thou mayest, he be nor ta'en nor slain."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then that same day there past into the hall<br>  A damsel of high lineage, and a brow<br>  May-blossom, and a cheek of apple-blossom,<br>  Hawk-eyes; and lightly was her slender nose<br>  Tip-tilted like the petal of a flower;<br>  She into hall past with her page and cried,<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O King, for thou hast driven the foe without,<br>  See to the foe within; bridge, ford, beset<br>  By bandits, everyone that owns a tower<br>  The Lord for half a league.  Why sit ye there?<br>  Rest would I not, Sir King, an I were king,<br>  Till even the lonest hold were all as free<br>  From cursed bloodshed, as thine altar-cloth<br>  From that best blood it is a sin to spill."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Comfort thyself," said Arthur, "I nor mine<br>  Rest: so my knighthood keep the vows they swore,<br>  The wastest moorland of our realm shall be<br>  Safe, damsel, as the centre of this hall.<br>  What is thy name? thy need?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name?" she said--<br>  "Lynette my name; noble; my need, a knight<br>  To combat for my sister, Lyonors,<br>  A lady of high lineage, of great lands,<br>  And comely, yea, and comelier than myself.<br>  She lives in Castle Perilous: a river<br>  Runs in three loops about her living-place;<br>  And o'er it are three passings, and three knights<br>  Defend the passings, brethren, and a fourth<br>  And of that four the mightiest, holds her stayed<br>  In her own castle, and so besieges her<br>  To break her will, and make her wed with him:<br>  And but delays his purport till thou send<br>  To do the battle with him, thy chief man<br>  Sir Lancelot whom he trusts to overthrow,<br>  Then wed, with glory: but she will not wed<br>  Save whom she loveth, or a holy life.<br>  Now therefore have I come for Lancelot."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Arthur mindful of Sir Gareth asked,<br>  "Damsel, ye know this Order lives to crush<br>  All wrongers of the Realm.  But say, these four,<br>  Who be they?  What the fashion of the men?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They be of foolish fashion, O Sir King,<br>  The fashion of that old knight-errantry<br>  Who ride abroad, and do but what they will;<br>  Courteous or bestial from the moment, such<br>  As have nor law nor king; and three of these<br>  Proud in their fantasy call themselves the Day,<br>  Morning-Star, and Noon-Sun, and Evening-Star,<br>  Being strong fools; and never a whit more wise<br>  The fourth, who always rideth armed in black,<br>  A huge man-beast of boundless savagery.<br>  He names himself the Night and oftener Death,<br>  And wears a helmet mounted with a skull,<br>  And bears a skeleton figured on his arms,<br>  To show that who may slay or scape the three,<br>  Slain by himself, shall enter endless night.<br>  And all these four be fools, but mighty men,<br>  And therefore am I come for Lancelot."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereat Sir Gareth called from where he rose,<br>  A head with kindling eyes above the throng,<br>  "A boon, Sir King--this quest!" then--for he marked<br>  Kay near him groaning like a wounded bull--<br>  "Yea, King, thou knowest thy kitchen-knave am I,<br>  And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I,<br>  And I can topple over a hundred such.<br>  Thy promise, King," and Arthur glancing at him,<br>  Brought down a momentary brow.  "Rough, sudden,<br>  And pardonable, worthy to be knight--<br>  Go therefore," and all hearers were amazed.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the damsel's forehead shame, pride, wrath<br>  Slew the May-white: she lifted either arm,<br>  "Fie on thee, King!  I asked for thy chief knight,<br>  And thou hast given me but a kitchen-knave."<br>  Then ere a man in hall could stay her, turned,<br>  Fled down the lane of access to the King,<br>  Took horse, descended the slope street, and past<br>  The weird white gate, and paused without, beside<br>  The field of tourney, murmuring "kitchen-knave."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now two great entries opened from the hall,<br>  At one end one, that gave upon a range<br>  Of level pavement where the King would pace<br>  At sunrise, gazing over plain and wood;<br>  And down from this a lordly stairway sloped<br>  Till lost in blowing trees and tops of towers;<br>  And out by this main doorway past the King.<br>  But one was counter to the hearth, and rose<br>  High that the highest-crested helm could ride<br>  Therethrough nor graze: and by this entry fled<br>  The damsel in her wrath, and on to this<br>  Sir Gareth strode, and saw without the door<br>  King Arthur's gift, the worth of half a town,<br>  A warhorse of the best, and near it stood<br>  The two that out of north had followed him:<br>  This bare a maiden shield, a casque; that held<br>  The horse, the spear; whereat Sir Gareth loosed<br>  A cloak that dropt from collar-bone to heel,<br>  A cloth of roughest web, and cast it down,<br>  And from it like a fuel-smothered fire,<br>  That lookt half-dead, brake bright, and flashed as those<br>  Dull-coated things, that making slide apart<br>  Their dusk wing-cases, all beneath there burns<br>  A jewelled harness, ere they pass and fly.<br>  So Gareth ere he parted flashed in arms.<br>  Then as he donned the helm, and took the shield<br>  And mounted horse and graspt a spear, of grain<br>  Storm-strengthened on a windy site, and tipt<br>  With trenchant steel, around him slowly prest<br>  The people, while from out of kitchen came<br>  The thralls in throng, and seeing who had worked<br>  Lustier than any, and whom they could but love,<br>  Mounted in arms, threw up their caps and cried,<br>  "God bless the King, and all his fellowship!"<br>  And on through lanes of shouting Gareth rode<br>  Down the slope street, and past without the gate.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Gareth past with joy; but as the cur<br>  Pluckt from the cur he fights with, ere his cause<br>  Be cooled by fighting, follows, being named,<br>  His owner, but remembers all, and growls<br>  Remembering, so Sir Kay beside the door<br>  Muttered in scorn of Gareth whom he used<br>  To harry and hustle.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bound upon a quest<br>  With horse and arms--the King hath past his time--<br>  My scullion knave!  Thralls to your work again,<br>  For an your fire be low ye kindle mine!<br>  Will there be dawn in West and eve in East?<br>  Begone!--my knave!--belike and like enow<br>  Some old head-blow not heeded in his youth<br>  So shook his wits they wander in his prime--<br>  Crazed!  How the villain lifted up his voice,<br>  Nor shamed to bawl himself a kitchen-knave.<br>  Tut: he was tame and meek enow with me,<br>  Till peacocked up with Lancelot's noticing.<br>  Well--I will after my loud knave, and learn<br>  Whether he know me for his master yet.<br>  Out of the smoke he came, and so my lance<br>  Hold, by God's grace, he shall into the mire--<br>  Thence, if the King awaken from his craze,<br>  Into the smoke again."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lancelot said,<br>  "Kay, wherefore wilt thou go against the King,<br>  For that did never he whereon ye rail,<br>  But ever meekly served the King in thee?<br>  Abide: take counsel; for this lad is great<br>  And lusty, and knowing both of lance and sword."<br>  "Tut, tell not me," said Kay, "ye are overfine<br>  To mar stout knaves with foolish courtesies:"<br>  Then mounted, on through silent faces rode<br>  Down the slope city, and out beyond the gate.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the field of tourney lingering yet<br>  Muttered the damsel, "Wherefore did the King<br>  Scorn me? for, were Sir Lancelot lackt, at least<br>  He might have yielded to me one of those<br>  Who tilt for lady's love and glory here,<br>  Rather than--O sweet heaven!  O fie upon him--<br>  His kitchen-knave."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom Sir Gareth drew<br>  (And there were none but few goodlier than he)<br>  Shining in arms, "Damsel, the quest is mine.<br>  Lead, and I follow."  She thereat, as one<br>  That smells a foul-fleshed agaric in the holt,<br>  And deems it carrion of some woodland thing,<br>  Or shrew, or weasel, nipt her slender nose<br>  With petulant thumb and finger, shrilling, "Hence!<br>  Avoid, thou smellest all of kitchen-grease.<br>  And look who comes behind," for there was Kay.<br>  "Knowest thou not me? thy master? I am Kay.<br>  We lack thee by the hearth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth to him,<br>  "Master no more! too well I know thee, ay--<br>  The most ungentle knight in Arthur's hall."<br>  "Have at thee then," said Kay: they shocked, and Kay<br>  Fell shoulder-slipt, and Gareth cried again,<br>  "Lead, and I follow," and fast away she fled.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after sod and shingle ceased to fly<br>  Behind her, and the heart of her good horse<br>  Was nigh to burst with violence of the beat,<br>  Perforce she stayed, and overtaken spoke.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What doest thou, scullion, in my fellowship?<br>  Deem'st thou that I accept thee aught the more<br>  Or love thee better, that by some device<br>  Full cowardly, or by mere unhappiness,<br>  Thou hast overthrown and slain thy master--thou!--<br>  Dish-washer and broach-turner, loon!--to me<br>  Thou smellest all of kitchen as before."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damsel," Sir Gareth answered gently, "say<br>  Whate'er ye will, but whatsoe'er ye say,<br>  I leave not till I finish this fair quest,<br>  Or die therefore."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay, wilt thou finish it?<br>  Sweet lord, how like a noble knight he talks!<br>  The listening rogue hath caught the manner of it.<br>  But, knave, anon thou shalt be met with, knave,<br>  And then by such a one that thou for all<br>  The kitchen brewis that was ever supt<br>  Shalt not once dare to look him in the face."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I shall assay," said Gareth with a smile<br>  That maddened her, and away she flashed again<br>  Down the long avenues of a boundless wood,<br>  And Gareth following was again beknaved.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir Kitchen-knave, I have missed the only way<br>  Where Arthur's men are set along the wood;<br>  The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves:<br>  If both be slain, I am rid of thee; but yet,<br>  Sir Scullion, canst thou use that spit of thine?<br>  Fight, as thou canst: I have missed the only way."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So till the dusk that followed evensong<br>  Rode on the two, reviler and reviled;<br>  Then after one long slope was mounted, saw,<br>  Bowl-shaped, through tops of many thousand pines<br>  A gloomy-gladed hollow slowly sink<br>  To westward--in the deeps whereof a mere,<br>  Round as the red eye of an Eagle-owl,<br>  Under the half-dead sunset glared; and shouts<br>  Ascended, and there brake a servingman<br>  Flying from out of the black wood, and crying,<br>  "They have bound my lord to cast him in the mere."<br>  Then Gareth, "Bound am I to right the wronged,<br>  But straitlier bound am I to bide with thee."<br>  And when the damsel spake contemptuously,<br>  "Lead, and I follow," Gareth cried again,<br>  "Follow, I lead!" so down among the pines<br>  He plunged; and there, blackshadowed nigh the mere,<br>  And mid-thigh-deep in bulrushes and reed,<br>  Saw six tall men haling a seventh along,<br>  A stone about his neck to drown him in it.<br>  Three with good blows he quieted, but three<br>  Fled through the pines; and Gareth loosed the stone<br>  From off his neck, then in the mere beside<br>  Tumbled it; oilily bubbled up the mere.<br>  Last, Gareth loosed his bonds and on free feet<br>  Set him, a stalwart Baron, Arthur's friend.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well that ye came, or else these caitiff rogues<br>  Had wreaked themselves on me; good cause is theirs<br>  To hate me, for my wont hath ever been<br>  To catch my thief, and then like vermin here<br>  Drown him, and with a stone about his neck;<br>  And under this wan water many of them<br>  Lie rotting, but at night let go the stone,<br>  And rise, and flickering in a grimly light<br>  Dance on the mere. Good now, ye have saved a life<br>  Worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood.<br>  And fain would I reward thee worshipfully.<br>  What guerdon will ye?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gareth sharply spake,<br>  "None! for the deed's sake have I done the deed,<br>  In uttermost obedience to the King.<br>  But wilt thou yield this damsel harbourage?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the Baron saying, "I well believe<br>  You be of Arthur's Table," a light laugh<br>  Broke from Lynette, "Ay, truly of a truth,<br>  And in a sort, being Arthur's kitchen-knave!--<br>  But deem not I accept thee aught the more,<br>  Scullion, for running sharply with thy spit<br>  Down on a rout of craven foresters.<br>  A thresher with his flail had scattered them.<br>  Nay--for thou smellest of the kitchen still.<br>  But an this lord will yield us harbourage,<br>  Well."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she spake.  A league beyond the wood,<br>  All in a full-fair manor and a rich,<br>  His towers where that day a feast had been<br>  Held in high hall, and many a viand left,<br>  And many a costly cate, received the three.<br>  And there they placed a peacock in his pride<br>  Before the damsel, and the Baron set<br>  Gareth beside her, but at once she rose.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meseems, that here is much discourtesy,<br>  Setting this knave, Lord Baron, at my side.<br>  Hear me--this morn I stood in Arthur's hall,<br>  And prayed the King would grant me Lancelot<br>  To fight the brotherhood of Day and Night--<br>  The last a monster unsubduable<br>  Of any save of him for whom I called--<br>  Suddenly bawls this frontless kitchen-knave,<br>  'The quest is mine: thy kitchen-knave am I,<br>  And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I.'<br>  Then Arthur all at once gone mad replies,<br>  'Go therefore,' and so gives the quest to him--<br>  Him--here--a villain fitter to stick swine<br>  Than ride abroad redressing women's wrong,<br>  Or sit beside a noble gentlewoman."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then half-ashamed and part-amazed, the lord<br>  Now looked at one and now at other, left<br>  The damsel by the peacock in his pride,<br>  And, seating Gareth at another board,<br>  Sat down beside him, ate and then began.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend, whether thou be kitchen-knave, or not,<br>  Or whether it be the maiden's fantasy,<br>  And whether she be mad, or else the King,<br>  Or both or neither, or thyself be mad,<br>  I ask not: but thou strikest a strong stroke,<br>  For strong thou art and goodly therewithal,<br>  And saver of my life; and therefore now,<br>  For here be mighty men to joust with, weigh<br>  Whether thou wilt not with thy damsel back<br>  To crave again Sir Lancelot of the King.<br>  Thy pardon; I but speak for thine avail,<br>  The saver of my life."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth said,<br>  "Full pardon, but I follow up the quest,<br>  Despite of Day and Night and Death and Hell."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when, next morn, the lord whose life he saved<br>  Had, some brief space, conveyed them on their way<br>  And left them with God-speed, Sir Gareth spake,<br>  "Lead, and I follow."  Haughtily she replied.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I fly no more: I allow thee for an hour.<br>  Lion and stoat have isled together, knave,<br>  In time of flood.  Nay, furthermore, methinks<br>  Some ruth is mine for thee.  Back wilt thou, fool?<br>  For hard by here is one will overthrow<br>  And slay thee: then will I to court again,<br>  And shame the King for only yielding me<br>  My champion from the ashes of his hearth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom Sir Gareth answered courteously,<br>  "Say thou thy say, and I will do my deed.<br>  Allow me for mine hour, and thou wilt find<br>  My fortunes all as fair as hers who lay<br>  Among the ashes and wedded the King's son."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the shore of one of those long loops<br>  Wherethrough the serpent river coiled, they came.<br>  Rough-thicketed were the banks and steep; the stream<br>  Full, narrow; this a bridge of single arc<br>  Took at a leap; and on the further side<br>  Arose a silk pavilion, gay with gold<br>  In streaks and rays, and all Lent-lily in hue,<br>  Save that the dome was purple, and above,<br>  Crimson, a slender banneret fluttering.<br>  And therebefore the lawless warrior paced<br>  Unarmed, and calling, "Damsel, is this he,<br>  The champion thou hast brought from Arthur's hall?<br>  For whom we let thee pass."  "Nay, nay," she said,<br>  "Sir Morning-Star.  The King in utter scorn<br>  Of thee and thy much folly hath sent thee here<br>  His kitchen-knave: and look thou to thyself:<br>  See that he fall not on thee suddenly,<br>  And slay thee unarmed: he is not knight but knave."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at his call, "O daughters of the Dawn,<br>  And servants of the Morning-Star, approach,<br>  Arm me," from out the silken curtain-folds<br>  Bare-footed and bare-headed three fair girls<br>  In gilt and rosy raiment came: their feet<br>  In dewy grasses glistened; and the hair<br>  All over glanced with dewdrop or with gem<br>  Like sparkles in the stone Avanturine.<br>  These armed him in blue arms, and gave a shield<br>  Blue also, and thereon the morning star.<br>  And Gareth silent gazed upon the knight,<br>  Who stood a moment, ere his horse was brought,<br>  Glorying; and in the stream beneath him, shone<br>  Immingled with Heaven's azure waveringly,<br>  The gay pavilion and the naked feet,<br>  His arms, the rosy raiment, and the star.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she that watched him, "Wherefore stare ye so?<br>  Thou shakest in thy fear: there yet is time:<br>  Flee down the valley before he get to horse.<br>  Who will cry shame?  Thou are not knight but knave."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Gareth, "Damsel, whether knave or knight,<br>  Far liefer had I fight a score of times<br>  Than hear thee so missay me and revile.<br>  Fair words were best for him who fights for thee;<br>  But truly foul are better, for they send<br>  That strength of anger through mine arms, I know<br>  That I shall overthrow him."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he that bore<br>  The star, when mounted, cried from o'er the bridge,<br>  "A kitchen-knave, and sent in scorn of me!<br>  Such fight not I, but answer scorn with scorn.<br>  For this were shame to do him further wrong<br>  Than set him on his feet, and take his horse<br>  And arms, and so return him to the King.<br>  Come, therefore, leave thy lady lightly, knave.<br>  Avoid: for it beseemeth not a knave<br>  To ride with such a lady."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dog, thou liest.<br>  I spring from loftier lineage than thine own."<br>  He spake; and all at fiery speed the two<br>  Shocked on the central bridge, and either spear<br>  Bent but not brake, and either knight at once,<br>  Hurled as a stone from out of a catapult<br>  Beyond his horse's crupper and the bridge,<br>  Fell, as if dead; but quickly rose and drew,<br>  And Gareth lashed so fiercely with his brand<br>  He drave his enemy backward down the bridge,<br>  The damsel crying, "Well-stricken, kitchen-knave!"<br>  Till Gareth's shield was cloven; but one stroke<br>  Laid him that clove it grovelling on the ground.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then cried the fallen, "Take not my life: I yield."<br>  And Gareth, "So this damsel ask it of me<br>  Good--I accord it easily as a grace."<br>  She reddening, "Insolent scullion: I of thee?<br>  I bound to thee for any favour asked!"<br>  "Then shall he die."  And Gareth there unlaced<br>  His helmet as to slay him, but she shrieked,<br>  "Be not so hardy, scullion, as to slay<br>  One nobler than thyself."  "Damsel, thy charge<br>  Is an abounding pleasure to me.  Knight,<br>  Thy life is thine at her command.  Arise<br>  And quickly pass to Arthur's hall, and say<br>  His kitchen-knave hath sent thee.  See thou crave<br>  His pardon for thy breaking of his laws.<br>  Myself, when I return, will plead for thee.<br>  Thy shield is mine--farewell; and, damsel, thou,<br>  Lead, and I follow."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fast away she fled.<br>  Then when he came upon her, spake, "Methought,<br>  Knave, when I watched thee striking on the bridge<br>  The savour of thy kitchen came upon me<br>  A little faintlier: but the wind hath changed:<br>  I scent it twenty-fold."  And then she sang<br>  "'O morning star' (not that tall felon there<br>  Whom thou by sorcery or unhappiness<br>  Or some device, hast foully overthrown),<br>  'O morning star that smilest in the blue,<br>  O star, my morning dream hath proven true,<br>  Smile sweetly, thou! my love hath smiled on me.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But thou begone, take counsel, and away,<br>  For hard by here is one that guards a ford--<br>  The second brother in their fool's parable--<br>  Will pay thee all thy wages, and to boot.<br>  Care not for shame: thou art not knight but knave."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom Sir Gareth answered, laughingly,<br>  "Parables?  Hear a parable of the knave.<br>  When I was kitchen-knave among the rest<br>  Fierce was the hearth, and one of my co-mates<br>  Owned a rough dog, to whom he cast his coat,<br>  'Guard it,' and there was none to meddle with it.<br>  And such a coat art thou, and thee the King<br>  Gave me to guard, and such a dog am I,<br>  To worry, and not to flee--and--knight or knave--<br>  The knave that doth thee service as full knight<br>  Is all as good, meseems, as any knight<br>  Toward thy sister's freeing."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay, Sir Knave!<br>  Ay, knave, because thou strikest as a knight,<br>  Being but knave I hate thee all the more."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair damsel, you should worship me the more,<br>  That, being but knave, I throw thine enemies."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ay, ay," she said, "but thou shalt meet thy match."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they touched the second river-loop,<br>  Huge on a huge red horse, and all in mail<br>  Burnished to blinding, shone the Noonday Sun<br>  Beyond a raging shallow.  As if the flower,<br>  That blows a globe of after arrowlets,<br>  Ten thousand-fold had grown, flashed the fierce shield,<br>  All sun; and Gareth's eyes had flying blots<br>  Before them when he turned from watching him.<br>  He from beyond the roaring shallow roared,<br>  "What doest thou, brother, in my marches here?"<br>  And she athwart the shallow shrilled again,<br>  "Here is a kitchen-knave from Arthur's hall<br>  Hath overthrown thy brother, and hath his arms."<br>  "Ugh!" cried the Sun, and vizoring up a red<br>  And cipher face of rounded foolishness,<br>  Pushed horse across the foamings of the ford,<br>  Whom Gareth met midstream: no room was there<br>  For lance or tourney-skill: four strokes they struck<br>  With sword, and these were mighty; the new knight<br>  Had fear he might be ashamed; but as the Sun<br>  Heaved up a ponderous arm to strike the fifth,<br>  The hoof of his horse slipt in the stream, the stream<br>  Descended, and the Sun was washed away.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gareth laid his lance athwart the ford;<br>  So drew him home; but he that fought no more,<br>  As being all bone-battered on the rock,<br>  Yielded; and Gareth sent him to the King.<br>  "Myself when I return will plead for thee."<br>  "Lead, and I follow."  Quietly she led.<br>  "Hath not the good wind, damsel, changed again?"<br>  "Nay, not a point: nor art thou victor here.<br>  There lies a ridge of slate across the ford;<br>  His horse thereon stumbled--ay, for I saw it.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'O Sun' (not this strong fool whom thou, Sir Knave,<br>  Hast overthrown through mere unhappiness),<br>  'O Sun, that wakenest all to bliss or pain,<br>  O moon, that layest all to sleep again,<br>  Shine sweetly: twice my love hath smiled on me.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What knowest thou of lovesong or of love?<br>  Nay, nay, God wot, so thou wert nobly born,<br>  Thou hast a pleasant presence.  Yea, perchance--<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'O dewy flowers that open to the sun,<br>  O dewy flowers that close when day is done,<br>  Blow sweetly: twice my love hath smiled on me.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What knowest thou of flowers, except, belike,<br>  To garnish meats with? hath not our good King<br>  Who lent me thee, the flower of kitchendom,<br>  A foolish love for flowers? what stick ye round<br>  The pasty? wherewithal deck the boar's head?<br>  Flowers? nay, the boar hath rosemaries and bay.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'O birds, that warble to the morning sky,<br>  O birds that warble as the day goes by,<br>  Sing sweetly: twice my love hath smiled on me.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What knowest thou of birds, lark, mavis, merle,<br>  Linnet? what dream ye when they utter forth<br>  May-music growing with the growing light,<br>  Their sweet sun-worship? these be for the snare<br>  (So runs thy fancy) these be for the spit,<br>  Larding and basting.  See thou have not now<br>  Larded thy last, except thou turn and fly.<br>  There stands the third fool of their allegory."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there beyond a bridge of treble bow,<br>  All in a rose-red from the west, and all<br>  Naked it seemed, and glowing in the broad<br>  Deep-dimpled current underneath, the knight,<br>  That named himself the Star of Evening, stood.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth, "Wherefore waits the madman there<br>  Naked in open dayshine?"  "Nay," she cried,<br>  "Not naked, only wrapt in hardened skins<br>  That fit him like his own; and so ye cleave<br>  His armour off him, these will turn the blade."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the third brother shouted o'er the bridge,<br>  "O brother-star, why shine ye here so low?<br>  Thy ward is higher up: but have ye slain<br>  The damsel's champion?" and the damsel cried,<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No star of thine, but shot from Arthur's heaven<br>  With all disaster unto thine and thee!<br>  For both thy younger brethren have gone down<br>  Before this youth; and so wilt thou, Sir Star;<br>  Art thou not old?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old, damsel, old and hard,<br>  Old, with the might and breath of twenty boys."<br>  Said Gareth, "Old and over-bold in brag!<br>  But that same strength which threw the Morningn Star<br>  Can throw the Evening."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then that other blew<br>  A hard and deadly note upon the horn.<br>  "Approach and arm me!" With slow steps from out<br>  An old storm-beaten, russet, many-stained<br>  Pavilion, forth a grizzled damsel came,<br>  And armed him in old arms, and brought a helm<br>  With but a drying evergreen for crest,<br>  And gave a shield whereon the Star of Even<br>  Half-tarnished and half-bright, his emblem, shone.<br>  But when it glittered o'er the saddle-bow,<br>  They madly hurled together on the bridge;<br>  And Gareth overthrew him, lighted, drew,<br>  There met him drawn, and overthrew him again,<br>  But up like fire he started: and as oft<br>  As Gareth brought him grovelling on his knees,<br>  So many a time he vaulted up again;<br>  Till Gareth panted hard, and his great heart,<br>  Foredooming all his trouble was in vain,<br>  Laboured within him, for he seemed as one<br>  That all in later, sadder age begins<br>  To war against ill uses of a life,<br>  But these from all his life arise, and cry,<br>  "Thou hast made us lords, and canst not put us down!"<br>  He half despairs; so Gareth seemed to strike<br>  Vainly, the damsel clamouring all the while,<br>  "Well done, knave-knight, well stricken, O good knight-knave--<br>  O knave, as noble as any of all the knights--<br>  Shame me not, shame me not.  I have prophesied--<br>  Strike, thou art worthy of the Table Round--<br>  His arms are old, he trusts the hardened skin--<br>  Strike--strike--the wind will never change again."<br>  And Gareth hearing ever stronglier smote,<br>  And hewed great pieces of his armour off him,<br>  But lashed in vain against the hardened skin,<br>  And could not wholly bring him under, more<br>  Than loud Southwesterns, rolling ridge on ridge,<br>  The buoy that rides at sea, and dips and springs<br>  For ever; till at length Sir Gareth's brand<br>  Clashed his, and brake it utterly to the hilt.<br>  "I have thee now;" but forth that other sprang,<br>  And, all unknightlike, writhed his wiry arms<br>  Around him, till he felt, despite his mail,<br>  Strangled, but straining even his uttermost<br>  Cast, and so hurled him headlong o'er the bridge<br>  Down to the river, sink or swim, and cried,<br>  "Lead, and I follow."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the damsel said,<br>  "I lead no longer; ride thou at my side;<br>  Thou art the kingliest of all kitchen-knaves.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'O trefoil, sparkling on the rainy plain,<br>  O rainbow with three colours after rain,<br>  Shine sweetly: thrice my love hath smiled on me.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir,--and, good faith, I fain had added--Knight,<br>  But that I heard thee call thyself a knave,--<br>  Shamed am I that I so rebuked, reviled,<br>  Missaid thee; noble I am; and thought the King<br>  Scorned me and mine; and now thy pardon, friend,<br>  For thou hast ever answered courteously,<br>  And wholly bold thou art, and meek withal<br>  As any of Arthur's best, but, being knave,<br>  Hast mazed my wit: I marvel what thou art."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damsel," he said, "you be not all to blame,<br>  Saving that you mistrusted our good King<br>  Would handle scorn, or yield you, asking, one<br>  Not fit to cope your quest.  You said your say;<br>  Mine answer was my deed.  Good sooth!  I hold<br>  He scarce is knight, yea but half-man, nor meet<br>  To fight for gentle damsel, he, who lets<br>  His heart be stirred with any foolish heat<br>  At any gentle damsel's waywardness.<br>  Shamed? care not! thy foul sayings fought for me:<br>  And seeing now thy words are fair, methinks<br>  There rides no knight, nor Lancelot, his great self,<br>  Hath force to quell me."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigh upon that hour<br>  When the lone hern forgets his melancholy,<br>  Lets down his other leg, and stretching, dreams<br>  Of goodly supper in the distant pool,<br>  Then turned the noble damsel smiling at him,<br>  And told him of a cavern hard at hand,<br>  Where bread and baken meats and good red wine<br>  Of Southland, which the Lady Lyonors<br>  Had sent her coming champion, waited him.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon they past a narrow comb wherein<br>  Were slabs of rock with figures, knights on horse<br>  Sculptured, and deckt in slowly-waning hues.<br>  "Sir Knave, my knight, a hermit once was here,<br>  Whose holy hand hath fashioned on the rock<br>  The war of Time against the soul of man.<br>  And yon four fools have sucked their allegory<br>  From these damp walls, and taken but the form.<br>  Know ye not these?" and Gareth lookt and read--<br>  In letters like to those the vexillary<br>  Hath left crag-carven o'er the streaming Gelt--<br>  "PHOSPHORUS," then "MERIDIES"--"HESPERUS"--<br>  "NOX"--"MORS," beneath five figures, armed men,<br>  Slab after slab, their faces forward all,<br>  And running down the Soul, a Shape that fled<br>  With broken wings, torn raiment and loose hair,<br>  For help and shelter to the hermit's cave.<br>  "Follow the faces, and we find it.  Look,<br>  Who comes behind?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one--delayed at first<br>  Through helping back the dislocated Kay<br>  To Camelot, then by what thereafter chanced,<br>  The damsel's headlong error through the wood--<br>  Sir Lancelot, having swum the river-loops--<br>  His blue shield-lions covered--softly drew<br>  Behind the twain, and when he saw the star<br>  Gleam, on Sir Gareth's turning to him, cried,<br>  "Stay, felon knight, I avenge me for my friend,"<br>  And Gareth crying pricked against the cry;<br>  But when they closed--in a moment--at one touch<br>  Of that skilled spear, the wonder of the world--<br>  Went sliding down so easily, and fell,<br>  That when he found the grass within his hands<br>  He laughed; the laughter jarred upon Lynette:<br>  Harshly she asked him, "Shamed and overthrown,<br>  And tumbled back into the kitchen-knave,<br>  Why laugh ye? that ye blew your boast in vain?"<br>  "Nay, noble damsel, but that I, the son<br>  Of old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent,<br>  And victor of the bridges and the ford,<br>  And knight of Arthur, here lie thrown by whom<br>  I know not, all through mere unhappiness--<br>  Device and sorcery and unhappiness--<br>  Out, sword; we are thrown!"  And Lancelot answered, "Prince,<br>  O Gareth--through the mere unhappiness<br>  Of one who came to help thee, not to harm,<br>  Lancelot, and all as glad to find thee whole,<br>  As on the day when Arthur knighted him."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gareth, "Thou--Lancelot!--thine the hand<br>  That threw me?  An some chance to mar the boast<br>  Thy brethren of thee make--which could not chance--<br>  Had sent thee down before a lesser spear,<br>  Shamed had I been, and sad--O Lancelot--thou!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the maiden, petulant, "Lancelot,<br>  Why came ye not, when called? and wherefore now<br>  Come ye, not called?  I gloried in my knave,<br>  Who being still rebuked, would answer still<br>  Courteous as any knight--but now, if knight,<br>  The marvel dies, and leaves me fooled and tricked<br>  And only wondering wherefore played upon:<br>  And doubtful whether I and mine be scorned.<br>  Where should be truth if not in Arthur's hall,<br>  In Arthur's presence?  Knight, knave, prince and fool,<br>  I hate thee and for ever."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lancelot said,<br>  "Blessed be thou, Sir Gareth! knight art thou<br>  To the King's best wish.  O damsel, be you wise<br>  To call him shamed, who is but overthrown?<br>  Thrown have I been, nor once, but many a time.<br>  Victor from vanquished issues at the last,<br>  And overthrower from being overthrown.<br>  With sword we have not striven; and thy good horse<br>  And thou are weary; yet not less I felt<br>  Thy manhood through that wearied lance of thine.<br>  Well hast thou done; for all the stream is freed,<br>  And thou hast wreaked his justice on his foes,<br>  And when reviled, hast answered graciously,<br>  And makes merry when overthrown.  Prince, Knight,<br>  Hail, Knight and Prince, and of our Table Round!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then when turning to Lynette he told<br>  The tale of Gareth, petulantly she said,<br>  "Ay well--ay well--for worse than being fooled<br>  Of others, is to fool one's self.  A cave,<br>  Sir Lancelot, is hard by, with meats and drinks<br>  And forage for the horse, and flint for fire.<br>  But all about it flies a honeysuckle.<br>  Seek, till we find."  And when they sought and found,<br>  Sir Gareth drank and ate, and all his life<br>  Past into sleep; on whom the maiden gazed.<br>  "Sound sleep be thine! sound cause to sleep hast thou.<br>  Wake lusty!  Seem I not as tender to him<br>  As any mother?  Ay, but such a one<br>  As all day long hath rated at her child,<br>  And vext his day, but blesses him asleep--<br>  Good lord, how sweetly smells the honeysuckle<br>  In the hushed night, as if the world were one<br>  Of utter peace, and love, and gentleness!<br>  O Lancelot, Lancelot"--and she clapt her hands--<br>  "Full merry am I to find my goodly knave<br>  Is knight and noble.  See now, sworn have I,<br>  Else yon black felon had not let me pass<br>  To bring thee back to do the battle with him.<br>  Thus an thou goest, he will fight thee first;<br>  Who doubts thee victor? so will my knight-knave<br>  Miss the full flower of this accomplishment."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Lancelot, "Peradventure he, you name,<br>  May know my shield.  Let Gareth, an he will,<br>  Change his for mine, and take my charger, fresh,<br>  Not to be spurred, loving the battle as well<br>  As he that rides him."  "Lancelot-like," she said,<br>  "Courteous in this, Lord Lancelot, as in all."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gareth, wakening, fiercely clutched the shield;<br>  "Ramp ye lance-splintering lions, on whom all spears<br>  Are rotten sticks! ye seem agape to roar!<br>  Yea, ramp and roar at leaving of your lord!--<br>  Care not, good beasts, so well I care for you.<br>  O noble Lancelot, from my hold on these<br>  Streams virtue--fire--through one that will not shame<br>  Even the shadow of Lancelot under shield.<br>  Hence: let us go."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent the silent field<br>  They traversed.  Arthur's harp though summer-wan,<br>  In counter motion to the clouds, allured<br>  The glance of Gareth dreaming on his liege.<br>  A star shot: "Lo," said Gareth, "the foe falls!"<br>  An owl whoopt: "Hark the victor pealing there!"<br>  Suddenly she that rode upon his left<br>  Clung to the shield that Lancelot lent him, crying,<br>  "Yield, yield him this again: 'tis he must fight:<br>  I curse the tongue that all through yesterday<br>  Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now<br>  To lend thee horse and shield: wonders ye have done;<br>  Miracles ye cannot: here is glory enow<br>  In having flung the three: I see thee maimed,<br>  Mangled: I swear thou canst not fling the fourth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And wherefore, damsel? tell me all ye know.<br>  You cannot scare me; nor rough face, or voice,<br>  Brute bulk of limb, or boundless savagery<br>  Appal me from the quest."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, Prince," she cried,<br>  "God wot, I never looked upon the face,<br>  Seeing he never rides abroad by day;<br>  But watched him have I like a phantom pass<br>  Chilling the night: nor have I heard the voice.<br>  Always he made his mouthpiece of a page<br>  Who came and went, and still reported him<br>  As closing in himself the strength of ten,<br>  And when his anger tare him, massacring<br>  Man, woman, lad and girl--yea, the soft babe!<br>  Some hold that he hath swallowed infant flesh,<br>  Monster!  O Prince, I went for Lancelot first,<br>  The quest is Lancelot's: give him back the shield."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Gareth laughing, "An he fight for this,<br>  Belike he wins it as the better man:<br>  Thus--and not else!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lancelot on him urged<br>  All the devisings of their chivalry<br>  When one might meet a mightier than himself;<br>  How best to manage horse, lance, sword and shield,<br>  And so fill up the gap where force might fail<br>  With skill and fineness.  Instant were his words.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gareth, "Here be rules.  I know but one--<br>  To dash against mine enemy and to win.<br>  Yet have I watched thee victor in the joust,<br>  And seen thy way."  "Heaven help thee," sighed Lynette.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then for a space, and under cloud that grew<br>  To thunder-gloom palling all stars, they rode<br>  In converse till she made her palfrey halt,<br>  Lifted an arm, and softly whispered, "There."<br>  And all the three were silent seeing, pitched<br>  Beside the Castle Perilous on flat field,<br>  A huge pavilion like a mountain peak<br>  Sunder the glooming crimson on the marge,<br>  Black, with black banner, and a long black horn<br>  Beside it hanging; which Sir Gareth graspt,<br>  And so, before the two could hinder him,<br>  Sent all his heart and breath through all the horn.<br>  Echoed the walls; a light twinkled; anon<br>  Came lights and lights, and once again he blew;<br>  Whereon were hollow tramplings up and down<br>  And muffled voices heard, and shadows past;<br>  Till high above him, circled with her maids,<br>  The Lady Lyonors at a window stood,<br>  Beautiful among lights, and waving to him<br>  White hands, and courtesy; but when the Prince<br>  Three times had blown--after long hush--at last--<br>  The huge pavilion slowly yielded up,<br>  Through those black foldings, that which housed therein.<br>  High on a nightblack horse, in nightblack arms,<br>  With white breast-bone, and barren ribs of Death,<br>  And crowned with fleshless laughter--some ten steps--<br>  In the half-light--through the dim dawn--advanced<br>  The monster, and then paused, and spake no word.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gareth spake and all indignantly,<br>  "Fool, for thou hast, men say, the strength of ten,<br>  Canst thou not trust the limbs thy God hath given,<br>  But must, to make the terror of thee more,<br>  Trick thyself out in ghastly imageries<br>  Of that which Life hath done with, and the clod,<br>  Less dull than thou, will hide with mantling flowers<br>  As if for pity?"  But he spake no word;<br>  Which set the horror higher; a maiden swooned:<br>  The Lady Lyonors wrung her hands and wept,<br>  As doomed to be the bride of Night and Death;<br>  Sir Gareth's head prickled beneath his helm;<br>  And even Sir Lancelot through his warm blood felt<br>  Ice strike, and all that marked him were aghast.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once Sir Lancelot's charger fiercely neighed,<br>  And Death's dark war-horse bounded forward with him.<br>  Then those that did not blink the terror, saw<br>  That Death was cast to ground, and slowly rose.<br>  But with one stroke Sir Gareth split the skull.<br>  Half fell to right and half to left and lay.<br>  Then with a stronger buffet he clove the helm<br>  As throughly as the skull; and out from this<br>  Issued the bright face of a blooming boy<br>  Fresh as a flower new-born, and crying, "Knight,<br>  Slay me not: my three brethren bade me do it,<br>  To make a horror all about the house,<br>  And stay the world from Lady Lyonors.<br>  They never dreamed the passes would be past."<br>  Answered Sir Gareth graciously to one<br>  Not many a moon his younger, "My fair child,<br>  What madness made thee challenge the chief knight<br>  Of Arthur's hall?"  "Fair Sir, they bade me do it.<br>  They hate the King, and Lancelot, the King's friend,<br>  They hoped to slay him somewhere on the stream,<br>  They never dreamed the passes could be past."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sprang the happier day from underground;<br>  And Lady Lyonors and her house, with dance<br>  And revel and song, made merry over Death,<br>  As being after all their foolish fears<br>  And horrors only proven a blooming boy.<br>  So large mirth lived and Gareth won the quest.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he that told the tale in older times<br>  Says that Sir Gareth wedded Lyonors,<br>  But he, that told it later, says Lynette.<br>
