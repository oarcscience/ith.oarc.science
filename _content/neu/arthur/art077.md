## CERDIC AND ARTHUR

### by

## JOHN LESSLIE HALL

  
Hengist went off to All-Father's keeping,  
Wihtgils's son, to the Wielder's protection,  
Earl of the Anglians. From the east came, then,  
Cerdic the Saxon a seven-year thereafter;  
The excellent atheling, offspring of Woden  
Came into Albion. His own dear land  
Lay off to the eastward out o'er the sea-ways,  
Far o'er the flood-deeps. His fair-haired, eagle-eyed  
Liegeman and son sailed westwardly,  
O'er the flint-gray floods, with his father and liegelord,  
O'er the dashing, lashing, dark-flowing currents  
That roll and roar, rumble, grumble  
Eastward of Albion. Not e'er hath been told me  
Of sea-goers twain trustier, doughtier  
Than Cerdic and Cynric, who sailed o'er the waters  
Valiant, invincible vikings and sea-dogs  
Seeking adventure. Swift westwardly,  
O'er the fallow floods, fared they to Albion,  
Would look for the land that liegemen-kinsmen  
Of Hengist and Horsa and high-mooded Aella  
And Cissa had come to. Cerdic was mighty,  
Earl of the Saxons. His excellent barks,  
His five good floats, fanned by the breezes,  
Gliding the waters were wafted to Albion,  
Ocean-encircled isle of the sea-waves,  
Delightsomest of lands. Lay then at anchor  
The five good keels close to the sea-shore;  
The swans of the sea sat on the water  
Close by the cliff-edge. The clever folk-leader  
Was boastful and blithesome, brave-mooded Saxon,  
Said to his earlmen: "Excellent thanes  
True-hearted, trusty table-companions,  
See the good land the loving, generous  
Gods have given you: go, seize on it.  
I and my son have sailed westwardly,  
To gain with our swords such goodly possessions  
As Hengist and Aella did erstwhile win  
On the island of Albion. On to the battle,  
The foe confronteth us." Folk of the island,  
Earlmen of Albion, angry-mooded, then,  
Stood stoutly there, striving to hurl them  
Off in the ocean east to the mainland,  
Back o'er the billows. Bravely Albion's  
Fearless defenders fought with the stranger  
Then and thereafter: early did Cerdic  
See and declare that slowly, bloodily,  
And foot by foot, must the folk of the Saxons  
Tear from the Welsh their well-lovèd, blithesome,  
Beautiful fatherland. Brave were the men that  
So long could repel the puissant, fearless  
Sons of the Saxons that had sailed o'er the oceans  
To do or to die, doughty, invincible  
Earls of the east. The excellent kinsmen,  
Father and son, scions of Woden,  
Burned in their spirit to build in the south the  
Greatest of kingdoms: 't was granted to Cerdic  
To be first of the famous folk-lords of Wessex,  
Land-chiefs belovèd; to lead, herald the  
World-famous roll of the wise, eminent  
Athelings of Wessex, where Egbert and Ethelwulf,  
Alfred and Edward, ever resplendently,  
Spaciously shine, shepherds of peoples,  
Excellent athelings, and Athelstan, Godwin  
And Harold the hero, helms of the Saxons,  
Have their names written in record of glory  
In legend and story, leaving their fame as an  
Honor forever to England, peerless  
Mother of heroes.--The men of the east  
Slowly, bloodily builded a kingdom  
Where Aesc and Aella not e'er had been able  
To bear their banners, though both these athelings  
Were in might marvellous, mood-brave, heroic  
Leaders of liegemen.--Beloved of the Welsh  
Was the atheling Arthur, excellent, valiant  
Lord of the Silurians, land-prince, warrior  
Famed 'mid the races. He rued bitterly  
That father and son, Saxon invaders,  
To the left and right were wresting, tearing  
From races no few their fond-lovèd, blood-bought  
Homesteads and manors, were hacking and sacking  
Folk of the southland, and far westwardly  
Had bitterly banished the best of the heroes  
And earlmen of Albion. Arthur was mighty,  
Uther Pendragon's offspring belovèd,  
His fame far-reaching. Afar and anear then,  
All men of Albion honored and loved him;  
Sent over Severn beseeching the mighty  
Silurian leader no longer to tarry  
In crushing the foemen, but quickly to drive them  
Back to their bottomless bogs in the eastward  
O'er the rime-cold sea; said wailingly:  
"The fierce, pitiless folk of the eastward,  
Mighty, remorseless men of the waters,  
Treacherous, terrible, will take speedily  
Our name and nation, and naught will be left us  
But to dare and to die." The doughty, invincible  
Atheling Arthur, earl of Siluria,  
Offspring of Uther, early was ready;  
Feared not, failed not, fared on his journey  
Seeking for Cerdic. Severn's waters  
Saw him and laughed, little expecting  
That Arthur the king and the excellent knights  
Of the Table Round, with troopers a-many,  
Would suffer the foemen to seize and possess the  
Lands of Siluria, would let the remorseless,  
Implacable, pitiless pagan and heathen  
Sail over Severn; not soon did it happen  
While Arthur the atheling his earth-joys tasted  
Here under heaven. That hero was brave,  
Great, all-glorious: God fought for him:  
Nor Cerdic nor Cynric could soon injure that  
Hero of Heaven; his horrible destiny  
Wyrd the weaver wove in her eerie,  
Mysterious meshes, mighty, taciturn  
Goddess of gods: she gives whom she will to  
Speed in the battle. Brave-mooded Arthur,  
Offspring of Uther, was eager for glory,  
Peerless of prowess: proudly, dauntlessly  
Fought he for Albion. Not e'er heard I  
Of better battle-knight, more bold, fearless,  
That sun ever shone on: the sheen of his glory  
With lustre illumined the land where his mother  
Gave birth to the bairn; and broad, mighty,  
Spacious his fame was; his splendid achievements  
Were known to all nations. None could e'er dare to  
Cope with that hero, till the conquering, dauntless  
Earl of the Anglians, ever-belovèd  
Founder of freedom and father of kings,  
O'er the seas sailing, slowly, bloodily  
Builded the best and broadest of kingdoms  
Heroes e'er heard of. The heart of king Arthur  
Was sad as he saw the Saxon invader  
How, foot by foot, forward, onward,  
He ever proceeded, eastward, westward,  
Far to the north, founding and building  
A kingdom and country to crush and destroy the  
Land that he long had lived for, thought for,  
Fiercely had fought for. Famed was Arthur,  
Wide his renown; but Wyrd the spinster  
Taketh no heed of hero or craven;  
Her warp and her woof she weaveth and spinneth  
Unmindful of men. The mighty war-hero,  
Atheling Arthur, set out on his journey,  
Laid down his life-joys; the belovèd folk-lord's  
Feasting was finished. Unflinching, fearless,  
Doomed unto death, dead on the battle-field  
Fell the brave folk-prince. Foul was the traitor,  
Hated of heroes. The hope of his countrymen  
Sank into darkness; for dead was Arthur,  
The last and the best and bravest of Albion's  
Athelings of eld. Not ever thereafter  
Could the Welshman withstand the sturdy, mighty  
Tread of the Saxon as tramping, advancing,  
Onward he went, eastward, westward,  
Far to the northward: none withstood him,  
Now Arthur was lifeless; he alone was able  
To stay for a moment that sturdy, mighty,  
Invincible march.--The valiant, doughty  
Kinsmen of Cerdic, conquering earlmen,  
Forward then bare bravely, unfalt'ringly,  
Daringly, dauntlessly, the dragon of Wessex  
Fuming and flaming; fearlessly bare it  
Northward, eastward, on to the westward,  
O'er Severn and Thames and Trent and Humber  
And east oceanward, till all the great races  
Of Albion's isle owned as their liegelords  
The children of Cerdic, sire of kings and  
Founder of freedom. Few among athelings  
Were greater than he, gift-lord eminent,  
Wielder of Wessex; the wise-mooded, far-seeing,  
Brave-hearted folk-prince builded his kingdom  
As a bulwark of freedom. His brave, high-hearted  
Table-companions, trusty, faithful  
Liegemen and thanes, leaped to his service  
In peace and in war: well did they love him,  
Bowed to his bidding; blithely followed him  
Where the fight was fiercest; would fall in the battle  
Gladly, eagerly, excellent heroes,  
Ere they'd leave their dear lord alone on the battle-field,  
Bearing unaided the onset of foes and  
The brunt of the battle. The brave ones were mindful  
Of the duties of liegemen; dastardly thought it  
To flee from the field while their fond, loving  
Leader and liegelord lingered thereon  
Dead or alive; deemed him a nidering  
Who stood not stoutly, sturdily, manfully  
Close to his lord as he led in the battle,  
Facing the foemen. The free-hearted earlmen  
Minded the days when their dear-honored liegelord  
Feasted the throngs of thanemen-kinsmen  
In the handsomest of halls heroes e'er sat in  
'Neath dome of the welkin. Well they remembered  
How their lord lovingly lavished his treasures  
On all earlmen older and younger,  
Greater and lesser: 't were loathsomest treason  
To leave such a lord alone in the battle,  
With a foe facing him. The folk-ruler mighty  
King-like requited them with costliest gems,  
Most bountiful banqueting. The brave-hearted man  
Builded his kingdom, broadly founded it  
Northward, eastward, on to the westward,  
South to the seaward. He said tenderly,  
Cerdic discoursed, king of the Saxons,  
Father of England: "Old, hoary is  
Cerdic your king, kinsmen-thanemen,  
Warriors of Wessex. Well have ye served me,  
Ye and your fathers. I yet remember  
How, ere age came on me, I ever was foremost  
In deeds of daring, in doughty achievements,  
In feats of prowess. I fought valiantly  
Alone, unaided, with only my faithful,  
Well-lovèd sword, and swept away hundreds  
Of earlmen of Albion: now age, ruthless,  
Horrible foe of heroes and warriors,  
Hath marred my might, though my mood is as daring,  
My spirit as stout and sturdy as ever  
In years of my youth. I yearn in my soul, now,  
To cross over Severn and cut into slivers  
The wolf-hearted Welshmen. Well-nigh a forty  
Years in their circuits have seen me a-conquering  
Here under heaven: from hence, early  
I go on my way. Woden will bid me  
To the halls of Valhalla, where heroes will meet me,  
Gladly will seat me 'mid the glory-encircled  
Heroes of heaven. In my heart it pains me  
To feel my war-strength fading and waning  
And ebbing away. Would I might leap now  
Like a king to the battle, not cow-like breathe out my  
Soul in the straw. The son of my bossom,  
Cynric my bairn, bravely will lead you  
When I am no more: he ever hath proved him  
A bold battle-earl. My blade I will give him,  
Sigbrand my sword: he hath served me faithfully  
Sixty of winters: well do I love him,  
Bold-hearted battle-brand." The brave earlmen, then,  
Shouted lustily, loudly commending  
The words of good Cerdic. Cynric they loved, too,  
Son of the hero; themselves had beheld him  
How valiant, adventurous, invincible, king-like  
He ever had borne him, since erst he landed  
To fight, with his father, the fierce, implacable,  
Wolf-hearted Welshmen: well did they love him,  
And oft on the ale-benches earlmen asserted  
That, when good king Cerdic, gracious, belovèd  
Ward of the kingdom, went on his journey,  
Laid down his life-joys, his liegefolk would never  
Find them a folk-lord fonder, truer,  
More honored of all men, than atheling Cynric  
Surely would prove him. Shouted they lustily,  
"Wes hael, wes hael! hero of Wessex,  
Cerdic the conqueror," clanging their lances  
And beating their bucklers, bellowed like oxen,  
Blew in their shields, shouting, yelling  
Glad-hearted, gleefully. The good one discoursed, then,  
Cerdic the king said to his liegemen  
(Henchmen all hearkened): "Hear ye, good troopers,  
Of Sigbrand my sword. I said he was trusty,  
And bitter in biting. I brought him to Albion  
Far from the eastward. I fared, long ago,  
East over Elbe and Oder and Weser  
And thence to the northward, never wearying,  
Greedy for glory; 'mid the Goths found it,  
Old, iron-made, excellent sword-blade,  
Weland his work. Well I remember  
How I heard high-hearted heroes and athelings,  
My true-hearted troopers, tell how a dragon,  
His cave guarding, kept there a treasure  
Age after age; how earls of the eastward  
Said that Sigbrand, the sword-blade of Hermann,  
Was kept in that cave covered with magic,  
Encircled with sorcery, secretly guarded,  
Bound with enchantments. I boldly adventured  
A grim grapple with that grisly, terrible  
Fire-spewing dragon, to fetch to the westward  
The well-lovèd, warlike, wide-famous brand  
Of Hermann the hero. I hied o'er the rivers  
And off to the eastward: earls of those lands there  
Laughed when they learned that a lad from the westward  
Would dare the great dragon that had daunted their fathers  
Five hundred winters. I fared eastward then,  
Met with the monster, mightily smote him,  
To earth felled him; flamings of battle  
Horribly hurled he, hotly he snorted,  
Would seethe me in poison. Wtih the point of my blade  
I proudly did prick him. Prone he fell forward,  
Dead lay the dragon. His den was no more  
A horror to heroes; hastened I in, then,  
To joy in the sight of jewels and treasures  
And song-famous swords that had slept on the wall there  
From earliest eras, edge-keen, famous,  
Magic-encircled swords of the ancients,  
Old-work of giants. With joy, saw I  
World-famous Sigbrand, sword-blade of Hermann,  
Men-leader mighty, matchless battle-knight,  
Hero of Germany. I hastily seized it  
All rusting to ruin; the rime-carved, ancient  
Sword of the hero was soon hanging then  
Safe at my side: it hath served me faithfully  
Sixty of winters, well-tried, trusty  
Friend-in-the-battle. When I fare, troopers,  
Hence to Valhalla, high-hearted Cynric,  
My fond-lovèd son, folk-lord of Wessex,  
Will take up the brand borne by his father  
And carve out a kingdom clean to the northward and  
Wide to the westward; the Welshman will cower  
And shudder and shake, as the shout of the Saxon  
Frightens afresh forest and river  
And meadow and plain. I shall pass on my journey  
Early anon: old and hoary,  
Death will subdue me. Dear young heroes,  
Do as I bid ye. Bear ye onward  
The banner of Wessex. Wyrd will help you  
If doughty your valor. I dare to allege it,  
That the gods have given this goodly, bountiful  
Land of Albion to the liegemen and children  
Of Cerdic the Saxon; seize, hold to it  
Forever and ever. Ye early will see me  
Lorn of my life-joys, lying unwarlike,  
Dead in my armor. I urge you, good heroes,  
To build me a barrow broad-stretching, lofty,  
High on the cliff-edge, that comers from far  
May see it and say that so did Angle-folk  
Honor the atheling that erstwhile led their  
Fathers of old in founding a kingdom."
