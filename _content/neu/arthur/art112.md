## A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON

### by

## WILLIAM MORRIS

  
  
SIR GUY *being in the court of a Pagan castle* .  
This castle where I dwell, it stands  
A long way off from Christian lands,  
A long way off my lady's hands,  
A long way off the aspen trees,  
And murmur of the lime-tree bees.  
  
But down the Valley of the Rose  
My lady often hawking goes,  
Heavy of cheer; oft turns behind,  
Leaning towards the western wind,  
Because it bringeth to her mind  
Sad whisperings of happy times,  
The face of him who sings these rhymes.  
  
King Guilbert rides beside her there,  
Bends low and calls her very fair,  
And strives, by pulling down his hair,  
To hide from my dear lady's ken  
The grisly gash I gave him, when  
I cut him down at Camelot;  
However he strives, he hides it not,  
That tourney will not be forgot,  
Besides, it is King Guilbert's lot,  
Whatever he says she answers not.  
  
Now tell me, you that are in love,  
From the king's son to the wood-dove,  
Which is the better, he or I?  
  
For this king means that I should die  
In this lone Pagan castle, where  
The flowers droop in the bad air  
On the September evening.  
  
Look, now I take mine ease and sing,  
Counting as but a little thing  
The foolish spite of a bad king.  
  
For these vile things that hem me in,  
These Pagan beasts who live in sin,  
The sickly flowers pale and wan,  
The grim blue-bearded castellan,  
The stanchions half worn-out with rust,  
Whereto their banner vile they trust--  
Why, all these things I hold them just  
Like dragons in a missal book,  
Wherein, whenever we may look,  
We see no horror, yea, delight  
We have, the colours are so bright;  
Likewise we note the specks of white,  
And the great plates of burnish'd gold.  
  
Just so this Pagan castle old,  
And everything I can see there,  
Sick-pining in the marshland air,  
I note: I will go over now,  
Like one who paints with knitted brow,  
The flowers and all things one by one,  
From the snail on the wall to the setting sun.  
  
Four great walls, and a little one  
That leads down to the barbican,  
Which walls with many spears they man,  
When news comes to the castellan  
Of Launcelot being in the land.  
And as I sit here, close at hand  
Four spikes of sad sick sunflowers stand,  
The castellan with a long wand  
Cuts down their leaves as he goes by,  
Ponderingly, with screw'd-up eye,  
And fingers twisted in his beard--  
Nay, was it a knight's shout I heard?  
I have a hope makes me afeard:  
It cannot be, but if some dream  
Just for a minute made me deem  
I saw among the flowers there  
My lady's face with long red hair,  
Pale, ivory-colour'd dear face come,  
As I was wont to see her some  
Fading September afternoon,  
And kiss me, saying nothing, soon  
To leave me by myself again;  
Could I get this by longing: vain!  
  
The castellan is gone: I see  
On one broad yellow flower a bee  
Drunk with much honey--  
Christ! again,  
Some distant knight's voice brings me pain,  
I thought I had forgot to feel,  
I never heard the blissful steel  
These ten years past; year after year,  
Through all my hopeless sojourn here,  
No Christian pennon has been near;  
Laus Deo! the dragging wind draws on  
Over the marshes, battle won,  
Knights' shouts, and axes hammering,  
Yea, quicker now the dint and ring  
Of flying hoofs; ah, castellan,  
When they come back, count man for man,  
Say whom you miss.  
  
THE PAGANS *from the battlements* .  
Mahound to aid!  
Why flee ye so like men dismay'd?  
  
THE PAGANS *from without* .  
Nay, haste! for here is Launcelot,  
Who follows quick upon us, hot  
And shouting with his men-at-arms.  
  
SIR GUY  
Also the Pagans raise alarms,  
And ring the bells for fear; at last  
My prison walls will be well past.  
  
SIR LAUNCELOT *from outside* .  
Ho! in the name of the Trinity,  
Let down the drawbridge quick to me,  
And open doors, that I may see  
Guy the good knight.  
  
THE PAGANS *from the battlements* .  
Nay, Launcelot,  
With mere big words ye win us not.  
  
SIR LAUNCELOT  
Bid Miles bring up la perriere,  
And archers clear the vile walls there,  
Bring back the notches to the ear,  
Shoot well together! God to aid!  
These miscreants will be well paid.  
  
Hurrah! all goes together; Miles  
Is good to win my lady's smiles  
For his good shooting -- Launcelot!  
On knights a-pace! this game is hot!  
  
SIR GUY *sayeth afterwards* .  
I said, I go to meet her now,  
And saying so, I felt a blow  
From some clench'd hand across my brow,  
And fell down on the sunflowers  
Just as a hammering smote my ears,  
After which this I felt in sooth;  
My bare hands throttling without ruth  
The hairy-throated castellan;  
Then a grim fight with those that ran  
To slay me, while I shouted: "God  
For the Lady Mary!" deep I trod  
That evening in my own red blood;  
Nevertheless so stiff I stood,  
That when the knights burst the old wood  
Of the castle-doors, I was not dead.  
  
I kiss the Lady Mary's head,  
Her lips and her hair golden red,  
Because to-day we have been wed.
