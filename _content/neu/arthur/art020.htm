Gallia</i> 's Soil<br>  He left to calm <i> Brittannia</i> 's troubled Isle.<br>  Mean time in <i> Gallia</i>  when their Monarch found<br>  Himself recover'd from his painful Wound,<br>  He with his greatest Lords in Council sate<br>  About the Means to save the <i> Gallic</i>  State.<br>  Then thus the haughty Prince his Chiefs bespoke,<br>  Our Foes who would on <i> Gaul</i>  impose their Yoke,<br>  Are now expos'd to your avenging stroke.<br>  <i> Arthur</i> 's withdrawn <i> Britannia</i>  to compose,<br>  From whom his Army's Confidence arose.<br>  His Courage, Conduct, Military Fame<br>  Kindled within their Breasts a Martial Flame.<br>  His Presence made them obstinate in Fight,<br>  Eager of Conquest, and asham'd of Flight.<br>  But since the Soul that mov'd their Troops is gone,<br>  Leaving this Kingdom to secure his own,<br>  Let us employ this favourable Hour<br>  To free our Country from the <i> British</i>  Power.<br>  Let us advance our Ensigns valiant <i> Franks</i>  <br>  T'attack the Foe encamp'd on <i> Esia</i> 's Banks.<br>  We shall a weak desponding Host assail,<br>  And of a glorious Conquest cannot fail.<br>  He ceas'd, and all his Captains did reveal<br>  To storm the <i> British</i>  Camp a cheerful Zeal.<br>  Forthwith their Monarch's orders to pursue<br>  The Generals rose and to their Posts withdrew.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as <i> Aurora</i>  with her Rosy Light<br>  Had streak'd the gloomy Bosom of the Night;<br>  The Monarch rose and Eager of the War<br>  For bloody Labour did himself prepare.<br>  His Armour and his Arms his Servants brought<br>  All temper'd Plate by famous Masters wrought.<br>  His ample Shield was all of Burnish'd Gold,<br>  Dreadful indeed, but Glorious to behold.<br>  He lac'd his dazling Helm around his Head,<br>  Which thro' the Air did keen Reflection spread.<br>  His massy Sword he girded to his Wast,<br>  And his strong Thighs in beaten Gold encas'd.<br>  His Breast and Back in noble Armour shone<br>  In Battle by excessive Splendor known.<br>  Then in his hand two pondrous Spears he took,<br>  And round him cast a Stern and Haughty Look.<br>  On to the Field he led his Warlike <i> Franks</i>  <br>  And drew forth on the Plain th' embattled Ranks.<br>  The Steeds with raging Hoofs the ground did tear,<br>  And Chariots with their Thunder fill'd the Air.<br>  The Troops advancing o'er the Hills did Choak<br>  The Concave of the Sky with Dust and Smoke.<br>  Thro' which their Armours glancing Lustre show'd,<br>  Like radiant Sunbeams breaking thro' a Cloud.<br>  The deep Brigades compos'd an endless Throng,<br>  And with an awful Slowness march'd along.<br>  Drawn out in Order they display'd from far<br>  The sullen Pomp, and the rough Looks of War.<br>  As when short Days and cold Autumnal Air<br>  To some new Seat warn Swallows to repair,<br>  The chatt'ring Race do's round their Leaders fly,<br>  And at their Summons rendezvous on high,<br>  And with their Numbers darken all the Sky.<br>  So thick the <i> Franks</i>  did on their March appear<br>  So black and wide their Front, so long their Rear.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time the Scouts and Outguards did alarm<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth, and made the Captains arm.<br>  Who did, as order'd, in their Camp remain,<br>  Not to attack the Foe, but to sustain.<br>  Wise <i> Solmar</i>  plaid a wary Gen'ral's Part<br>  Guarding the Camp by all the Rules of Art.<br>  He in Battalia rang'd his valiant Host<br>  And did his Squadrons, as a Master, post,<br>  Where no Advantage of the Ground was lost.<br>  No prudent Measures did the Chief neglect<br>  Their Lines against th' Invader to protect.<br>  The chearful Captains to their Charge repair,<br>  Each takes his Post, and waits th' advancing War.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth in Arms the <i> Franks</i>  attend<br>  Bravely resolv'd each other to defend.<br>  <i> Solmar</i>  within the Army's Center stands,<br>  As most convenient to dispence Commands.<br>  The left Wing <i> Talmar</i>  did as Gen'ral sway,<br>  The right the valiant <i> Clovis</i>  did obey.<br>  Now at a distance did the marching Foes<br>  Their numerous Army's Warlike Front disclose.<br>  Bright Jav'lins, Sabres, brazen Backs, and Breasts,<br>  Gauntlets, contiguous Helmets, burnish'd Crests,<br>  Long glitt'ring Spears, broad Fauchions, temper'd Shie<br>  Spread with illustrious Horror all the Fields.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his bright Arms King <i> Clotar</i>  did advance<br>  Before his Troops, and shook his threat'ning Lance.<br>  The haughty Warriour strait began the Fight<br>  And furiously attack'd the <i> Briton</i> 's Right.<br>  With mighty Clamour and insulting Shouts<br>  The <i> Gallic</i>  Squadrons storm th' advanc'd Redoubts.<br>  The noble <i> Clovis</i>  all their Force sustains,<br>  Unmov'd, undaunted he his Ground maintains.<br>  Fearless of Death he on the Rampart stands<br>  Dispensing to his Troops sedate Commands.<br>  Projected Stones in Rocky Tempests fly,<br>  And Showers of Arrows fill the troubled Sky.<br>  Their brawny Arms destructive Javelins throw,<br>  And glitt'ring Darts on deadly Errands go.<br>  Some to oblige the <i> Britons</i>  to retire<br>  Hurl on them smoking Brands, and Storms of Fire.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  stands the flaming Charge, and pours<br>  Down in Exchange vast Stones in craggy Showers.<br>  Which with the slaughter'd Heaps the Trenches fill,<br>  And the bold Foe at once entomb and kill.<br>  A leafless Wood of tall erected Spears,<br>  O'erspreading all the spacious Field appears,<br>  As thick and close, as the young tender Trees<br>  Shoot up their Heads in thriving Nurserys.<br>  Undaunted they the lofty Bulwarks scale,<br>  And with their Sword in Hand the Foe assail.<br>  But by the valiant <i> Britons</i>  beaten back<br>  With mighty Slaughter they forsook th' Attack.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with fresh Force the <i> Britons</i>  to invade<br>  Valiant <i> Olcanor</i>  brought his bold Brigade.<br>  All valiant Men inur'd to Arms and Blood,<br>  Bred on the Banks of <i> Liger</i> 's Silver Flood.<br>  The mighty Chief mounts up, and on the Lines<br>  Waving his Sword in noble Armour shines.<br>  <i> Rollo</i>  advanc'd to beat him from his Post,<br>  And to regain the Ground their Men had lost:<br>  But with his utmost Force his furious Foe<br>  On his bright Crest dealt such a dreadful Blow,<br>  That <i> Rollo</i>  stagg'ring in a dizzy Swoon<br>  Fell down upon his Knees, and prest the Ground:<br>  He lean'd upon his Buckler with his Hand,<br>  Yet scarcely so his swimming Head sustain'd.<br>  Then brandishing his Fauchion in the Air<br>  The fatal Stroke the Conq'rour did prepare:<br>  When mighty <i> Oloron</i>  the <i> Neustrian</i>  Chief<br>  All fir'd with Rage flew to his Friend's Relief.<br>  He interpos'd his generous Arms, and took<br>  Upon his ringing Shield the falling Stroke.<br>  The <i> Neustrian</i>  Lord ran in, and round his Wast<br>  With his strong Arms he hugg'd and grip'd him fast:<br>  Then from the Ground he rais'd the Warriour up,<br>  And hurl'd him headlong from the Rampart's Top.<br>  Off from the high rais'd Works the mighty <i> Gaul</i>  <br>  Fell down, and shook the Vally with his Fall.<br>  So vast <i> Enceladus,</i>  as Poets tell,<br>  Gigantic Ruin, from the Mountains fell<br>  By which he seal'd th' Imperial Seat of <i> Jove</i> ,<br>  Struck down by vengeful Thunder from above.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave <i> Miran</i>  next warm with his Youthful Flame<br>  Up to the Charge with his Battalion's came.<br>  To mount the Lines he straitway gave Command,<br>  But would himself be foremost of the Band.<br>  <i> Vebba</i>  observing brought a mighty Stone<br>  And from the high Entrenchment roll'd it down,<br>  It took the noble Warriour in his Way,<br>  And both within the Trenches buried lay.<br>  <i> Rosan</i>  advanc'd, <i> Romulian</i> 's learned Son,<br>  Who midst the <i> Bards</i>  had many Laurels won,<br>  And now to martial Glory did aspire;<br>  He climb'd the Works urg'd with a noble Fire:<br>  With his right Hand he did his Fauchion weild,<br>  And with his left he held his spacious Shield.<br>  Up to the high Entrenchment's brow he rose,<br>  Amidst the thickest Darts, and thickest Foes.<br>  He with his Spear <i> Radan</i>  and <i> Tabal</i>  slew,<br>  And down the Works <i> Lanvallo</i>  headlong threw.<br>  <i> Coril</i>  the valiant <i> Durotrigian</i>  Knight<br>  Bravely advanc'd, and undertook the Fight.<br>  The undaunted <i> Frank</i>  stept forth to meet the Foe,<br>  And aiming at his Breast a mortal Blow,<br>  To give his Javelin Force stretcht every Vein,<br>  Did all his Nerves, and brawny Muscles strain.<br>  The <i> Briton</i> 's Shield receiv'd th' impetuous Stroke<br>  Which in the second Fold its Fury broke.<br>  Then with a mighty Force the <i> Briton</i>  cast<br>  His massy Spear, which thro' the Buckler past,<br>  And pierc'd the <i> Frank</i>  between the Hip and Wast.<br>  Down to the Ground he came, and endless Night<br>  Swam o'er his Eyes, and choak'd their vital Light.<br>  Then to the Charge renown'd <i> Olando</i>  flew,<br>  Which mounting up <i> Capellan</i> 's Javelin slew.<br>  With such a Vigor was the Weapon thrown,<br>  It pierc'd his Buckler crash'd his Collar Bone,<br>  And enter'd deep within the Warriour's Chest,<br>  Who fell with all the Pangs of Death opprest,<br>  And rolling down from the high <i> Ramparts</i>  Brow<br>  Increast the Dead, that lay in Heaps below.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now ghastly Ruin and Destruction reign,<br>  And scatter'd Spoils o'erspread the bloody Plain.<br>  The Noise of raging Cohorts, horrid Crys,<br>  And Groans of dying Men afflict the Skys.<br>  O'er Shields and Helms down the steep <i> Rampart</i>  flow'd<br>  Torrents, and Crimson Cataracts of Blood<br>  That fill'd the Trenches with a dismal Flood.<br>  In vain the <i> Franks</i>  their fierce Assault repeat,<br>  Vanquish'd with mighty Loss they still retreat.<br>  King <i> Clotar</i> 's Soul was gaul'd, and all on fire<br>  To see his Legions from th' Attack retire.<br>  He flew along the Lines to take a View<br>  Where he th' Assault might with Success renew.<br>  That done he drew his Forces from the Right, <br>  And on the Left began a second Fight.<br>  Now did the King his fresh Battalions pour<br>  Upon the Place he judg'd the least secure.<br>  Great <i> Oromel</i>  did at his Lords Command,<br>  Lead on the Troops his Sabre in his Hand.<br>  Thick Clouds of glitt'ring Darts and Spears they send<br>  To break the Troops that did the Lines defend.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  to repel th' invading Foe<br>  Hurl mighty Stones, and Showers of Javelins throw.<br>  Those bravely storm, and these as well defend,<br>  And missive Arms in bloody Contest spend.<br>  While they with mutual Wounds each other gall,<br>  On this and that side mighty Numbers fall.<br>  But <i> Oromel</i>  shaking his trembling Lance<br>  Commands his bold Battalions to advance.<br>  He mounted up the Works, and with his Spear<br>  His Passage thro' the thickest Ranks did clear.<br>  Dispensing Death upon the Lines he stood<br>  With Brains bespatter'd, and deform'd with Blood.<br>  In vain the <i> Britons</i>  did the <i> Frank</i>  invade,<br>  Who all around him vast Destruction made.<br>  Nor glitt'ring Darts, nor Stones, nor Smoke, nor Fire,<br>  Could damp the Chief, and force him to retire.<br>  His fatal Fauchion first <i> Glendoran</i>  felt<br>  Fam'd for his Arms, and rich embroider'd Belt.<br>  The dreadful Weapon did his Arm divide,<br>  And not yet cloy'd went deep into his Side.<br>  He fell upon the Ground and endless Night<br>  Lay on his Eyes to interrupt the Light.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Balandor</i>  next a noble <i> Neustrian</i>  Lord<br>  Felt in his bleeding Veins the Conquerour's Sword.<br>  Down on the Neck it fell with horrid Sway,<br>  And forc'd quite thro' the sever'd Joynt its Way.<br>  Strait Crimson Jets sprang up from every Vein,<br>  The gasping Head leap'd off, and bounded on the Plain.<br>  Then <i> Ridar,</i>  <i> Araban</i> , and many more,<br>  Slain by the <i> Frank</i>  lay weltring in their Gore.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Othar</i>  mean while his furious Javelin threw<br>  Which aim'd at <i> Milo</i>  on its Message flew.<br>  It pass'd his Buckler, and the painful Point<br>  Wounded his Knee, and enter'd far the Joynt.<br>  Back to the Rear off from the fierce Attack,<br>  Strong <i> Sebul</i>  bore him on his brawny Back.<br>  Then <i> Asdran</i>  cast his Dart with wondrous Force,<br>  The glitt'ring Death with an impetuous Course<br>  Against young <i> Trebor</i> 's Helmet flew direct,<br>  Which now no longer could his Head protect:<br>  The Dart his ample Forehead struck, and full<br>  Between his thick-black Eyebrows pierc'd his Skull.<br>  It reach'd the inmost Marrow of the Brain<br>  Where we perceive our Pleasures, and our Pain.<br>  There where the Soul upon her Throne abides,<br>  And from our Sight conceal'd her Empire guides:<br>  Do's various Orders various Tasks dispence,<br>  To all th' inferiour Ministers of Sence.<br>  Now suddain Death do's her high Seat invade,<br>  And spreads the Courts of Life with horrid Shade.<br>  A fatal Dart which strong <i> Odallon</i>  cast,<br>  Pierc'd <i> Modar</i> 's Shield and thro' his Temples past:<br>  Extended on the Ground the Hero lay,<br>  His Eyeballs struggling with departing Day.<br>  A massy Spear which <i> Orbal</i> 's Arm convey'd,<br>  Past half its Length thro' <i> Kirton</i> 's Shoulder Blade,<br>  And on the Dust th' expiring Captain laid.<br>  A pondrous Stone crush'd <i> Cadel</i> 's brawny Thigh,<br>  Which made the Chief in raging Anguish ly;<br>  But then a second struck him in the Breast,<br>  And of its painful Prison Life releast.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When noble <i> Talmar</i>  saw what Numbers fell,<br>  By the Victorious Sword of <i> Oromel</i> ;<br>  And how his wavering Friends began to yield<br>  Prest by the furious <i> Frank,</i>  the bloody Field:<br>  Up to the Charge he came resolv'd to chase<br>  Th' Invader back, or dy upon the Place.<br>  Against the <i> Frank</i>  his massy Spear he hurl'd,<br>  Which had dispatch'd him to th' infernal World,<br>  Had it not glancing from his Buckler flew,<br>  And by an erring Wound <i> Somellan</i>  slew.<br>  Then <i> Oromel</i>  advancing to the Fight,<br>  Threw his long Weapon with prodigious Might.<br>  Th' impetuous Spear cut swiftly thro' the Sky,<br>  And thro' his Buckler raz'd the <i> Briton</i> 's Thigh.<br>  A Purple Stream spun from the painful Wound,<br>  And striving thro' his Armour stain'd the Ground.<br>  <i> Talmar</i>  enrag'd both with the Shame and Smart,<br>  Cast at th' insulting Foe his second Dart.<br>  A prosp'rous Flight the vengeful Weapon took,<br>  The Buckler pierc'd, and thro' the Cuitass broke:<br>  Thro' the left Side it made its Way between<br>  The Border of the Midriff and the Spleen.<br>  The Warriour fainting with the fatal Wound,<br>  Dropt his bright Arms, and fell upon the Ground.<br>  Cold Death congeal'd his Blood within his Veins,<br>  And clos'd his Eyes, with everlasting Chains.<br>  Then did the Conq'rour with his Arms attack<br>  The thickest Foes, and forc'd their Legions back.<br>  Across the Lines he did his Troops pursue,<br>  And as they fled prodigious Numbers slew.<br>  The thin Remains forsook th' unequal Fight,<br>  And sav'd themselves by ignominious Flight.<br>  As when loud Western Winds arrive from far<br>  Upon <i> Batavia</i> 's Coast to levy War:<br>  The roaring Sea draws down its threatning Troops,<br>  To storm the Frontier, which its Progress stops.<br>  The foaming Files, and all the watry Ranks<br>  Rush on to Battle, and insult the Banks.<br>  But they contend to force their Way in vain,<br>  The <i> Digues</i>  unshaken all their Force sustain.<br>  The wearied Sea murmurs at these Defeats,<br>  Draws off its broken Billows, and retreats.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as King <i> Clotar</i>  saw his Men retir'd,<br>  With Rage, and Shame, and Indignation fir'd,<br>  He drew up fresh Brigades against the Right,<br>  Resolv'd to try his Fate again in Fight.<br>  Advance your Ensigns to the <i> Franks</i>  he cry'd,<br>  And show your Valour oft in Battel try'd.<br>  For <i> Gallia</i> 's Glory often you have fought,<br>  And from the Field triumphant Laurels brought.<br>  Now to protect her Towns and Altars show<br>  Your fearless Arms, and here invade the Foe.<br>  Here let us force their Lines, and make our Way,<br>  When well resolv'd no Works your Course can stay.<br>  Then lifting high his Shield to guard his Head,<br>  He up the Lines his furious Cohorts led.<br>  With double Rage they did the Works invade,<br>  And with loud Shouts a vig'rous Onset made.<br>  By various Ways th' undaunted <i> Briton</i>  strove<br>  The Foe that press'd so boldly to remove.<br>  Some Spears, some Darts, some iron Wedges threw,<br>  Here flaming Firebrands, here bright Javelins flew<br>  And here vast Stones the fierce Invader slew.<br>  Here to oppress their Sight hot Embers fell,<br>  Here Pots with horrid Stench annoy'd their Smell.<br>  Great Numbers perish'd in the bold Attack,<br>  Such stout Resistance did the <i> Britons</i>  make.<br>  <i> Ormansel</i>  by a craggy Stone was slain,<br>  Which from his broken Skull dash'd out his Brain. <br>  <i> Bortran</i>  a Chief brave and expert in Fight,<br>  By a projected Firebrand lost his Sight.<br>  An iron Wedge struck strong <i> Raymundo</i>  dead,<br>  Beating his Helmet deep into his Head.<br>  Valiant <i> Mansellan</i>  cast his furious Dart,<br>  Which thro' stout <i> Thedon</i> 's Shield transfixt his Heart.<br>  Blood, Brains, and Limbs did the high Lines distain,<br>  And all around lay squallid Heaps of slain.<br>  The dreadful Roar did all the Region scare<br>  Which issu'd from the brazen Throat of War.<br>  Horrid Confusion, lamentable Moans,<br>  Clashing of Arms and dying Warriours Groans,<br>  Amazing Clamours, and th' insulting Threats<br>  Of raging Captains vex'd th' Etherial Seats.<br>  Long did the <i> British</i>  Youth their Works maintain,<br>  And bravely did the fierce Assault sustain.<br>  Till worn with Toyl, and prest with numerous Troops,<br>  Still fresh pour'd on, they left the Ramparts Tops.<br>  King <i> Clotar</i>  on the Works his Standard plac'd,<br>  O'er which his throng'd Battalions raging pass'd.<br>  They forc'd the Camp, and like a conq'ring Flood<br>  Pass'd o'er the Banks, that long their Force withstood.<br>  <i> Clotar</i>  insulting at his Armys Head,<br>  On to the Foe his eager Squadrons led.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time brave <i> Clovis</i>  midst the <i> Britons</i>  flew,<br>  And urg'd the Youth the Battle to renew.<br>  With Shame and Fury mingled in his Eyes<br>  To the desponding Troops aloud he crys.<br>  What mean, my Friends, their Country to defame,<br>  And sink the Glory of the <i> British</i>  Name?<br>  Will you forget your Conquests? will you throw<br>  Your Wreaths and spreading Laurels from your Brow?<br>  Shall we be vanquish'd by a vanquish'd Foe?<br>  Can <i> Arthur</i> 's Souldiers fear? were <i> Arthur</i>  by<br>  Would you forsake your Monarch? would you fly?<br>  Unthoughtful Troops, say, Whither would you run,<br>  You fly to Danger, and your Safety shun.<br>  You cannot reach your Ships to pass the Main,<br>  You must disperse, and be as Straglers Slain.<br>  Come fly from Danger and the Fight renew,<br>  You can't be safe unless you Conquer too.<br>  He said, and strait urg'd with impetuous Rage<br>  The Chief advanc'd th' Invaders to engage.<br>  Upon the thickest Files the Warriour fell,<br>  Resolv'd to dy, or <i> Clotar</i>  to repel.<br>  <i> Alfonso</i>  who his progress first withstood<br>  Fell wounded down, and welter'd in his Blood.<br>  Within his Side he felt the fatal Dart<br>  Between his Ribs an Inch beneath his Heart.<br>  Another Spear was at great <i> Boson</i>  thrown<br>  Which pierc'd his Hip, and stuck within the Bone.<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  roar'd out, and tugging at the Spear<br>  In grievous Anguish halted to the Rear.<br>  Another Weapon did at <i> Damon</i>  fly,<br>  Which enter'd deep the Hollow of the Thigh;<br>  Wriggling and wrything in tormenting Pain<br>  He strove to draw the Weapon out in vain.<br>  From his wide Wound a reeking River flow'd,<br>  And all the Field around lay bath' d in blood.<br>  Feeble and fainting with the Vast Expence,<br>  The Warriour fell bereft of Life and Sense.<br>  <i> Hemar</i>  and <i> Dival</i>  by his Arms were Slain,<br>  And many more lay gasping on the Plain.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Troops who had before retir'd,<br>  Return'd to Battle by this Chief inspir'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time Wise <i> Solmar</i>  did with anxious Care<br>  Watch all the Turns and Chances of the War.<br>  And when he saw the <i> Franks</i>  had forc'd the Line,<br>  And that the <i> Britons</i>  did the Fight decline.<br>  Inglorious Rout and Ruin to prevent<br>  He fresh Recruits from the Main Battle sent,<br>  Which might the <i> British</i>  wavering Troops sustain,<br>  Repel the <i> Franks</i>  and still the Fight maintain.<br>  Then to inspire his Men to keep their Post,<br>  And strike a terror thro' the <i> Gallic</i>  Host,<br>  He noble <i> Osor</i>  from the Camp detach'd,<br>  And with the Chief a thousand Horse dispatch'd<br>  And to their faithful Leader gave Command<br>  To wheel about, and take the Hilly Land<br>  Which on the Right hand of the Camp arose,<br>  And then to March direct upon the Foes.<br>  Then valiant <i> Osor</i>  did without delay<br>  Wheel from the Rear his orders to obey.<br>  And in his March he took a Compass round,<br>  That undiscern'd he might possess the Ground.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now had brave <i> Clovis</i>  with his fatal Blade<br>  Amidst the Squadrons great Destruction made.<br>  Boldly he stood to stem th' o'erflowing Tide,<br>  Encompass'd round with Spoils on every Side.<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  enrag'd still fresh Battalions brought;<br>  And prest with whole Brigades the Warriour fought.<br>  He lopt strong <i> Clomire</i> 's Arm off at a blow,<br>  And cleft the bold <i> Orbazel</i> 's Head in two.<br>  <i> Ellan</i>  who in his Strength repos'd his trust,<br>  And <i> Gramol</i>  in his Armour prest the Dust.<br>  Nor did <i> Roballon</i>  better Fortune meet,<br>  Who lay expiring at the Conqueror's feet.<br>  Then at fierce <i> Maurel</i> 's head he aim'd his Stroke,<br>  But on the temper'd Shield his Fauchion broke.<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  who stood at distance round about,<br>  Ran in to seize him with a mighty shout.<br>  The Pious Warriour was their Captive made,<br>  And bound in Fetters to their Camp convey'd.<br>  Brave <i> Trelon</i>  to prevent great <i> Clovis</i>  Fate<br>  Brought up his Valiant Troops but came too late.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Clotar</i>  mean time did <i> Erla</i> 's Troops invade,<br>  And thro' the Files a mighty Havock made.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Chief did wondrous Courage show,<br>  But strove in vain to stop th' unequal Foe.<br>  Young <i> Harrel</i>  felt the Conqu'rours Weapon first,<br>  And groaning lay, and grov'ling in the Dust.<br>  <i> Torman</i>  advanc'd the Monarch to sustain<br>  But at his feet fell Dead upon the Plain.<br>  He next his massy Spear at <i> Corbel</i>  cast,<br>  Thro' all the Buckler's fold's the Weapon past, <br>  And thro' his tender Entrails passage found,<br>  The Cawl came forth, and hung down from the Wound.<br>  Down on the ground he fell, and gasping lay,<br>  While Death excluded from his Eyes the Day.<br>  Next <i> Pricel</i> 's Arm receiv'd the Javelin's point<br>  Between the Elbow and the Shoulder Joynt:<br>  The fatal Steel did the large Vein divide,<br>  And from its Chanel sprang th' Arterial Tide.<br>  Subsiding Life Ebb'd down apace, and left<br>  The Youth of Motion and of Sense bereft.<br>  Then at <i> Hermander</i>  did his Jav'lin fly,<br>  Which pierc'd his Buckler's Plate and Bullhide Ply<br>  Then thro' his breast and breathing Lungs it went,<br>  And sticking in his Back it's Fury spent.<br>  <i> Hermander</i>  Cough'd up from his Wheezing Chest<br>  Fresh Frothy Blood, but strangled and Opprest<br>  He fell upon the Ground and ratling lay,<br>  Stretch'd out his Limbs, and groan'd his Life away.<br>  <i> Coman</i>  applauded for his Youthful Charms,<br>  From all distinguish'd by his Painted Arms,<br>  And his rich Scarlet Scarf, by luckless chance<br>  Stood the next mark of <i> Clotar</i> 's fatal Lance.<br>  So the fair Lilly and the Poppy stand<br>  A gaudy Harvest for the Mower's hand.<br>  Strait at his Breast the Monarch's Weapon

worn,<br>  And with unequal Numbers overborn<br>  Began to shrink, while <i> Clotar</i> 's ravening Sword<br>  With undistinguish'd Rage around devour'd:<br>  When on the neighb'ring Hill upon the

Loud Shouts of Joy rang thro' the <i> British</i>  Camp,<br>  And struck thro' <i> Clotar</i> 's Troops a shiv'ring Damp.<br>  Those reassume the War with double Rage,<br>  And these but faintly with the Foe engage.<br>  Wavering a while they stood, but then gave way,<br>  And left th' unfinish'd Triumph of the Day.<br>  The <i> Gallic</i>  Troops did by their Flight proclaim,<br>  How much they fear'd Victorious <i> Arthur</i> 's Name.<br>  The conq'ring <i> Britons</i>  did the <i> Franks</i>  pursue,<br>  Hung on their Rear, and mighty Numbers slew.<br>  Only King <i> Clotar</i>  still refus'd to yield,<br>  But with his single Arms maintain'd the Field.<br>  <i> Solmar</i>  advanc'd to charge th' undaunted King,<br>  And at his Head did his bright <i> Javelin</i>  fling; <br>  His blazing Shield the furious Weapon struck<br>  Pass'd the first Fold, but in the second stuck.<br>  Then did the <i> Frank</i>  project his pondrous Spear<br>  Which hiss'd along, and cut the liquid

From long pursuit the <i> British</i>  Youth disswade.<br>  For Rest with Joy they to their Tents return,<br>  But <i> Clovis</i>  Chains and <i> Solmar</i> 's Wound they mourn.<br>  <i> Solmar</i>

Or from the <i> Asian,</i>  or the <i> Afric</i>  Shores.<br>  To which Pole next their numerous Fleets shall run,<br>  If to the Rising, or the Setting Sun.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throng'd

<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice has the Moon her changing Face renew'd<br>  Since we our Monarch's Orders have pursu'd.<br>  Expecting his return from <i> Albion</i> 's Coast,<br>  We with Defensive

In <i> Gallic</i>  Fields new Laurels to obtain.<br>  But when in Prospect of the <i> Neustrian</i>  Strand<br>  A sudden Tempest beat him off from Land:<br>  So those relate who on the Mountains

declare<br>  They would return, and leave th' unfinish'd War.<br>  Meantime our Leaders Absence makes the Foe<br>  More insolent, and bold in Battle grow.<br>  Captains advise, what Measure we shall take,<br>  Shall we return and <i> Gallia</i> 's Realm forsake,<br>  Or shall we here entrench'd our Camp defend, <br>  And still th' Arrival of our Prince attend.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, wise <i> Gotrick</i>  rose, and to the rest<br>  Thus with majestic Air himself exprest.<br>  The Stratagem which did the <i> Franks</i>  defeat<br>  We can no more, illustrious Chiefs, repeat.<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  who <i> Arthur</i> 's Presence then believ'd,<br>  By busy Fame will soon be undeceiv'd.<br>  Then well we know that no <i> Britannic</i>  Lord<br>  Is able to withstand King <i> Clotar</i> 's Sword.<br>  Should he again our high Entrenchments scale,<br>  His numerous Squadrons may at last prevail.<br>  Our two great Heros lest in chief Command,<br>  Who could if any, <i> Clotar</i> 's Rage withstand<br>  These we, alas, have lost. Great <i> Solmar</i> 's slain,<br>  Brave <i> Clovis</i>  do's in <i> Clotar</i> 's Power remain.<br>  Thrice happy Man if midst the fighting Bands<br>  Thou hast expir'd and scap'd the Tyrant's Hands!<br>  These were the Chiefs on whom we did depend<br>  As Men whose Arms our Bulwarks would defend.<br>  Our weary Troops who did demand before<br>  Their native Land do now demand it more.<br>  Prest by our hard Affairs we may presume<br>  King <i> Arthur</i> 's Leave to lead our Squadrons home.<br>  The pious Prince our Conduct will approve,<br>  Who to his People thus express our Love.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said. When mighty <i> Talmar</i>  Silence broke<br>  And thus the Lords and valiant Chiefs bespoke.<br>  Here did our Pious Monarch bid us stay,<br>  And his Command what Chief dares disobey?<br>  We must persist our Bulwarks to defend,<br>  And <i> Arthur</i> 's coming in the Camp attend.<br>  Shall we the Honour of our Isle deface,<br>  And show our selves a weak, degenerate Race?<br>  How will the Neighbour States our Arms despise,<br>  And mock our ignominious Cowardize?<br>  How will our Countrymen upbraid our Flight,<br>  And ask what Monsters did our Youth affright?<br>  Our Wives and Children swarming on the Strand<br>  Will mock our Fears, and beat us off from Land.<br>  How will th' observing World our Conduct blame?<br>  How will th' unhappy Christians curse our Name,<br>  Whom from their Chains we promis'd to release,<br>  When our Retreat their Suff'rings shall encrease?<br>  For thus provok'd th' inexorable Foe<br>  Will add more Weight, and multiply their Woe<br>  What Plagues, what Desolation must o'erwhelm<br>  Both the <i> Neustrasian</i>  and the <i> Gallic</i>  Realm,<br>  If we no longer will our Arms engage,<br>  But give them up a Prey to <i> Clotar</i> 's Rage?<br>  Let us prevent their Ruin, and our Shame,<br>  Express our Pity, and advance our Fame.<br>  Fixt and resolv'd let us our Bulwarks guard,<br>  Success at last our Patience will reward.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said. And <i> Trelon</i>  thus himself exprest.<br>  What Madness <i> Britons</i>  has your Minds possest?<br>  Will you betray your Monarch's righteous Cause,<br>  Defame your Isle, and yet expect Applause?<br>  Scar'd with phantastic Terrours will you run,<br>  And leave a War with such Success begun?<br>  Fear seems a Passion wise and eloquent,<br>  But makes the Danger which it would prevent.<br>  Let us the Passion own, and not disguise.<br>  In Vertue's Shape inglorious Cowardise.<br>  For running home what Reasons e'er you bring,<br>  Wisdom's the grave Pretence, but Fear's the thing.<br>  We still in <i> Gallia</i>  may in Safety stay,<br>  Defend our Bulwarks, and our Prince obey.<br>  Vainly 'tis urg'd the <i> Britons</i>  are dismay'd,<br>  'Tis fearful Captains make their Men afraid.<br>  Your Courage will confirm your wavering Troops,<br>  Inspire new Vigor, and revive their Hopes.<br>  Blame not the <i> British</i>  Youth who still obey,<br>  And boldly follow, when you lead the Way.<br>  Then laying on his mighty Sword his Hand,<br>  He cry'd, the Man that leads the foremost Band<br>  From out the Camp shall by this Fauchion dy,<br>  He ne'er shall scape, who first attempts to fly.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said. And straitway <i> Coril</i>  thus reply'd,<br>  Meer Courage is to Madness near ally'd,<br>  A Brutal Rage, which Prudence do's not guide.<br>  Cool Sense and Judgment with a noble Fire<br>  To make a finish'd Leader must conspire.<br>  Some by a wise Retreat have more Renown<br>  Than other Captains by a Conquest won.<br>  'Tis blind Perverseness in our Camp to stay,<br>  And not to go when Prudence leads the Way.<br>  Wisdom is no Defect of Martial Heat<br>  When Reason bids, 'tis Manly to retreat.<br>  For our Return no Reasons need be us'd<br>  Than those which <i> Gotric</i>  has before produc'd.<br>  I must declare for breaking up, to shun<br>  The mighty Risk which staying here we run.<br>  And if some Chiefs will this as Fear condemn,<br>  We must object their Want of Sense to them.<br>  We are not aw'd by Threats, and haughty Words,<br>  Nor do we think we wear unequal Swords.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceas'd. And strait immoderate Heats arose,<br>  While chol'rick Chiefs each other did oppose.<br>  Some for retreating, some for Stay contend,<br>  Some would forsake, and some their Camp defend.<br>  When <i> Maca</i>  saw the Strife still hotter grew,<br>  Fearing the Dangers which might thence ensue,<br>  He rose, and thus th' assembled Chiefs bespoke,<br>  <i> Britons;</i>  too much each other you provoke.<br>  A calm Debate our Contests might decide,<br>  But sharp Reproaches more your Minds divide.<br>  Your Dangers by your Discords you augment,<br>  And bring the Mischiefs which you would prevent.<br>  'Tis prudent then this Contest to adjourn,<br>  And when the dawning Morning shall return,<br>  Our Heats compos'd with Rest, our Minds sedate,<br>  In Council we'll revive this great Debate.<br>  He said.

for him entire.<br>  When you to Images respect shall show,<br>  Your Mind you need not with your Body bow.<br>  In every place th' Eternal dos abide,<br>  And therefore must in Statues too reside.<br>  When therefore you shall Adoration pay,<br>  Your Mind may thro' the Image make its way,<br>  And Worship to the God within convey.<br>  We do not Worship to a Stone demand,<br>  To Gods created by the Carver's hand.<br>  The God we Honour has his Throne above,<br>  To whom the Image dos our Rev'rence move.<br>  Presents we prize, and Pictures we commend,<br>  Because they mind us of our absent Friend.<br>  By Nature we to Nature's Lord arise,<br>  Who dwells in Bliss conceal'd from mortal Eyes.<br>  We view his Image stamp'd on Nature's Face,<br>  And by the Creatures to their Maker pass.<br>  This beauteous World, and all the rest above,<br>  Were made to raise our Wonder and our Love.<br>  The noblest Use that we in Creatures find<br>  Is to the first great Cause, t'advance the Mind.<br>  The Sun himself whose bright revealing Ray<br>  To it's more glorious Author shews the way,<br>  Serves Mortals more by this, than when it's Light<br>  From these dark Seats removes the Shades of Night.<br>  We can't Divine, Essential Glory see,<br>  Nor view th' Almighty's naked Majesty.<br>  We can't th' unequal Object comprehend;<br>  The Creatures must their help to Reason lend,<br>  While step by step it dos to Heav'n ascend.<br>  Wide Nature's Frame and all her steddy Laws<br>  Lead thinking Man to th' Independent Cause.<br>  And then the Creatures have their noblest Use,<br>  When thoughts Divine they in our Minds produce.<br>  Now in the Sacred Images we rear,<br>  This pious Use more plainly do's appear.<br>  These in our Breasts do warm Devotion raise,<br>  And mind us to advance th' Eternal's praise.<br>  They move our Minds his Greatness to adore,<br>  To love his Goodness, and revere his Power.<br>  They to his Duty stupid Man excite,<br>  And when he aims at Heav'n assist his Flight.<br>  And those who know the high and steepy way,<br>  The painful steps that reach Celestial Day,<br>  Will not of friendly Succors be afraid,<br>  But thankfully receive the proffer'd Aid.<br>  Our Senses to the Mind while lodg'd in Clay,<br>  Do all their various Images convey.<br>  Things that we tast, and feel, and see, afford<br>  The Seeds of Thought with which our Minds are stor'd.<br>  We therefore must the Deity conceive<br>  By such an Image as our Senses give.<br>  Spirits to us this only way are known,<br>  And such Conceptions we must form or none.<br>  Why then should Statues be condemn'd, design'd<br>  To raise Devotion in a Pious Mind,<br>  When if we think of God, within our Thought<br>  Some Image of his Being must be wrought?<br>  The Sacred Volumes oft th' Almighty name<br>  As having Parts and Limbs and Humane Frame.<br>  Th' Eternal to our Minds by Words and Ways<br>  Adapted to our Sense himself conveys,<br>  Whose Being still must be from Man conceal'd,<br>  If not by means that fit our State reveal'd.<br>  These Arguments my yielding Reason sway'd,<br>  When Worship first to Images I paid.<br>  And these with <i> Clovis</i>  too would soon succeed,<br>  Were first your Mind from Prepossession freed.<br>  Oh, let no groundless Prejudice oppose<br>  The Light, that from so pure a Fountain flows.<br>  May these kind Beams dispel the Clouds, and find<br>  An unobstructed Passage to your Mind.<br>  Thus you'll preserve your Life with guiltless Art,<br>  And still remain a Christian in your Heart.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ceas'd, and Pious <i> Clovis</i>  thus reply'd:<br>  In vain these artful Snares have oft been try'd.<br>  These are the Nets your crafty Priests prepare,<br>  The timorous and th' uncautious to ensnare.<br>  Such Arguments no Conquests could procure,<br>  If unassisted by the Tyrant's Power.<br>  If e'er these Feeble Arms Impression make,<br>  They from the Sword their Edge and Sharpness take.<br>  Affrighted Nature's willing to receive<br>  The dreadful Reason's Death and Torment give.<br>  She'll by a thousand shifts her Post maintain,<br>  And feels no Argument like that of Pain.<br>  The clearest Light and Reason will displease,<br>  Which thwart our Int'rest and disturb our Ease.<br>  A lawless Rout of Passions still engage<br>  In Nature's Cause with hideous Noise and Rage.<br>  Reason is in the Tumult quite supprest,<br>  And still the safest side we think the best.<br>  But let Tyrannic Power stand Neutral by,<br>  You'll soon the weakness of your Cause descry.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You that would still th' Almighty Being own,<br>  And yet to Idols bow and Gods unknown,<br>  Delude your selves with an absurd pretence,<br>  That still your Minds preserve their Innocence.<br>  We to th' Eternal Mind should Honour pay,<br>  As he himself prescribes the Rule and Way.<br>  No Modes of Adoration he'll admit,<br>  Because our wanton Fancy thinks 'em fit.<br>  No other Forms of Worship should be sought,<br>  But those alone observ'd which he has taught.<br>  He oft declares you shall no Image make,<br>  And asks from whence you'll his Resemblance take.<br>  This is his Will, this his commanding Word,<br>  Shall Man contend and call his Law absurd?<br>  Subjects are to obey, and not dispute<br>  A Will so pure, a Power so absolute.<br>  In vain alas deluding Priests pretend,<br>  That they their Worship to th' Allmighty send.<br>  That all the Honour to the Image paid<br>  Is thro' the Marble up to Heav'n convey'd:<br>  Then <i> Dan</i> 's and <i> Bethel</i> 's Calves would be excus'd,<br>  Which by the Tribes were for Devotion us'd.<br>  They mighty Zeal to <i> Jacob</i> 's God exprest,<br>  To honour him proclaim'd a solemn Feast,<br>  And Worship by the Calves to Heav'n addrest.<br>  When <i> Aaron</i>  by the murm'ring <i> Hebrews</i>  sway'd<br>  A Golden God of molten Ear-rings made,<br>  'Twas reer'd in Honour of th' Allmighty Hand,<br>  That brought their Youth from <i> Egypt</i> 's cruel Land.<br>  Yet in the sacred History you read<br>  How God incens'd condemn'd the impious Deed. <br>  When you Devotion to an Idol show,<br>  And on the Altar od'rous Incense throw,<br>  You make the Heathen Worshiper believe<br>  That you and he like Adoration give:<br>  You thus confirm the Pagan Votary<br>  And not asserting God, your God deny.<br>  The Mind by Words and Actions is exprest,<br>  And secret Reservations in the Breast<br>  Whereby you think to save your Innocence<br>  Make Hypocrites, and add a fresh Offence.<br>  The jealous God will not his Honour part,<br>  Nor share with Idols a divided Heart.<br>  'Tis not enough to own him in your Breast,<br>  He must in publick boldly be confest.<br>  Th' eternal Mind no prudent Neutral knows,<br>  We for his Cause declare, or are his Foes.<br>  The Managers who cautious Measures use,<br>  And fain would neither Sin nor Suff'ring chuse.<br>  Who like a crafty Statesman to provide<br>  For his own Safety fawns on either Side.<br>  These most th' Eternal's Jealousy provoke,<br>  At these his Vengeance aims the deadliest stroke.<br>  The Hypocrite defeats his own Design,<br>  Splits on the Rock he labours to decline.<br>  He can't himself by base Complyance save<br>  The Secret to be safe, is to be brave.<br>  We are to fiery Tryals brought to prove<br>  Our stedfast Faith, our Courage, and our Love.<br>  To shew th' Heroic Confessors are fit<br>  With Glory crown'd on Heav'nly Thrones to sit.<br>  To draw amaz'd Spectators to believe<br>  That Cause divine, that could such Courage give.<br>  You know, if you in Heart a Christian are,<br>  Our Heav'nly Founder often did declare<br>  The Marks that must his faithful Friends approve<br>  Are patient Suff'ring and their mutual Love.<br>  His Precept, and Example form'd his Friends<br>  For all the Sorrow that his Cause attends.<br>  He oft foretold them their approaching Fate<br>  And what they must expect from Tyrants Hate.<br>  He set the price, and told what Heav'n would cost,<br>  And what to gain that Kingdom must be lost.<br>  And this the constant Martyrs understood<br>  Who swam to Heav'n thro' a red tyde of Blood.<br>  Some were with Wounds, and cruel Scourging try'd,<br>  Some in the Flames with God-like Courage dy'd.<br>  Some were on Racks and Wheels in pieces drawn,<br>  Some ston'd to Death, and some asunder Sawn.<br>  To some a Refuge from the Tyrant's Sword,<br>  The Dens of milder Beasts did oft afford.<br>  They oft Deliv'rance nobly did refuse,<br>  And Vertue when 'twas least inviting chuse.<br>  Conscious what Bliss and Life Eternal meant,<br>  The blest Reward of hours divinely spent,<br>  And what a Heaven 'tis, to be Innocent;<br>  They could the World with brave Neglect despise,<br>  And the vain Joys which charm deluded Eyes.<br>  They with the just did rather Suff'rings bear,<br>  Then guilty Pleasures with th' unrighteous share.<br>  They laid down Life in Vertue's just Defence,<br>  Dear Life, but not so dear as Innocence.<br>  But <i> Merula</i>  could these blest Saints have taught<br>  Their Torments to escape without a Fault.<br>  The specious Arguments which you advance<br>  Will make them Martyrs to their Ignorance.<br>  Had those blest Men your nice distinctions known,<br>  They to the Idol might have Worship shown;<br>  For if their inward Thought did not consent,<br>  The Guilt no farther than the Body went;<br>  And thus their Innocence had been secure,<br>  And while the Knee had err'd, the Heart been pure.<br>  Those who alledge we cannot form a Thought<br>  But by some Image thro' our Senses brought;<br>  And therefore we th' Almighty must conceive,<br>  By some Idea which the Senses give,<br>  Will soon th' erroneous Argument detect,<br>  When on their own Conceptions they reflect.<br>  Sense do's, 'tis true, it's Object first enjoy,<br>  And that first Object do's our Thoughts employ.<br>  All Knowledge previous to the acts of Sense<br>  And in-born Notions, are a vain Pretence.<br>  But then, 'tis true, that when our Minds embrace<br>  Those Images which thro' our Senses pass,<br>  They stop not there, but quickly higher go,<br>  And on themselves reflecting Know they Know.<br>  They their own Actions oft review, and thence<br>  Conceptions form above the Sphear of Sense.<br>  They by their Operations must conclude<br>  They are with Life, and Thought, and Choice endu'd,<br>  And hence the Intellectual World is known,<br>  While we conceive their Nature by our own.<br>  Then climbs the Mind to the first glorious Cause,<br>  And his bright Image by this Model draws.<br>  Freedom of Choice, pure Intellectual Light,<br>  Power Independent, Goodness Infinite,<br>  To form the great Idea we unite.<br>  All other Images for him design'd<br>  Debase the Glory of th' Eternal Mind;<br>  Degrade his high Perfections, and infuse<br>  Unworthy Thoughts, and Vulgar Minds abuse.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceas'd. Fair <i> Merula</i>  reply'd. Your Breast<br>  Is, as I fear'd, too strongly Prepossest,<br>  To be with new tho' truer Lights imprest.<br>  When to Dispute a Woman takes the Field,<br>  A Man believes he can't in Honour Yield.<br>  I am not here a Match, the Righteous Cause<br>  From my Defence great disadvantage draws.<br>  But now if <i> Clovis</i>  who's in Reason strong,<br>  Wise in Debate, and Eloquent of Tongue,<br>  Would change the Scene, and plead my Cause, how clear<br>  How pure, he'd make my Innocence appear?<br>  Such is your force in Reasoning, such your Art<br>  That Error you to seeming Truth convert.<br>  The strangest Paradox sustain'd by you<br>  Ev'n to Sagacious Minds appears as true.<br>  But why, alass, should <i> Clovis</i>  thus Employ<br>  Such noble Gifts their Owner to destroy?<br>  If Reason can't let Love your Breast incline,<br>  Oh, Pity your sad fate, or Pity mine.<br>  What Words shall tell, what Accents shall relate,<br>  If you are gone, my Lamentable State?<br>  What will become of wretched <i> Merula</i> ,<br>  What shall I do, whither my Self convey?<br>  What can my tedious Life afford to please,<br>  What can asswage my Grief, or Sorrows Ease?<br>  I must to unfrequented places creep,<br>  And seek out secret Corners where to Weep.<br>  I must complain to Woods, and Winds, and Air,<br>  Conscious, alass, in vain of my Despair.<br>  Forsaken, helpless, ruin'd, sore distrest<br>  With mighty Woe, and Life it self Opprest,<br>  I must behind you stay, and make my Moan<br>  To <i> Gallic</i>  Tyrants, or to Lords unknown.<br>  Oh, let the dear Engagements of our Love<br>  Dissolve your Heart, and your Compassion move.<br>  You warm Affection once to me exprest,<br>  And thought me fair, pretended so at least.<br>  What dear, engaging, tender things you said,<br>  Which in my Breast the glowing Passion fed?<br>  What Pleasure in my Presence did you show,<br>  And how was I still pleas'd to see you so?<br>  And do's my Presence now so much offend,<br>  That you to part for ever, thus contend?<br>  Or if your Love continue, can you go<br>  And leave me in so sad a Scene of Woe?<br>  But if from me you can so easie part,<br>  Let these your tender Children melt your Heart.<br>  Think how much Woe these Infants must attend,<br>  Without a Father, and without a Friend.<br>  See that dear Boy, how the sweet Creature stands?<br>  How just like you, he moves his little Hands?<br>  See your own Shape, your very Eyes, and Face,<br>  He has your Air, your Step, and every Grace.<br>  Then, <i> Clovis,</i>  on his Sister cast your look,<br>  In whom you once such wondrous pleasure took.<br>  How oft you kist and Danc'd her on your Knee,<br>  And said you lov'd the Child, because she look'd like me.<br>  These are next you, of all my Joys the chief,<br>  But if you die will give me no Relief,<br>  But minding me of you, revive my Grief.<br>  When on them I shall look theyll but invite<br>  New floods of Tears, and fresh Complaints excite.<br>  Can't these endearing Pledges of our Love<br>  Dissolve your Heart, and your Compassion move?<br>  Can you these sweet Delights chuse to forsake,<br>  And from the helpless Babes their Father take?<br>  Think how their Lives they must in Sorrow spend,<br>  Who will you leave your Orphans to defend?<br>  You know your Foes will labour to Oppress<br>  Your helpless Widow, and your Fatherless.<br>  Can such a Father e'er Unnatural prove,<br>  Cease to be tender, and forget to Love?<br>  Can you lay by th' Indulgent Parent's care,<br>  And leave these Babes abandon'd to despair?<br>  At such Reflections do's not Nature start,<br>  And try at every Spring to touch your Heart?<br>  Do's not soft Pity's fire begin to burn,<br>  Do not your yearning Bowels in you turn?<br>  In such a case Breasts arm'd with temper'd Steel<br>  And Hearts of Marble, should impression feel.<br>  Then on her bended Knees she fell, and fast,<br>  All drown'd in Tears, his Fetter'd Limbs embrac'd.<br>  And thus she cry'd, here ever will I stay,<br>  Here will I lie, here beg, and weep, and pray,<br>  And strive in Sighs to breath my Life away;<br>  Till <i> Clovis</i>  shall our heavy Doom retrieve,<br>  And say he do's at last consent to Live.<br>  Then the sad Mother to her Children said,<br>  Come, Children, help your Father to perswade.<br>  Your Accents full of Grief, and free from Art,<br>  Will penetrate the most obdurate heart.<br>  Your tender Cries will sure his Soul incline,<br>  Your Prayer will more successful prove than mine.<br>  The Children mov'd to see her so distrest,<br>  Burst out in Tears, and the sad Scene increast.<br>  They did about their Father cling, and cry<br>  With mournful Voice, why Father will you dy?<br>  This tender sight did Pious <i> Clovis</i>  move;<br>  And in his Breast his mighty Passion strove.<br>  Paternal Pity pain'd his lab'ring Soul,<br>  And made his Bowels in Convulsions roll.<br>  Deep Groans he in his Agony did fetch,<br>  And all his heart-strings felt the utmost stretch.<br>  Striving his Passion to suppress he stood,<br>  At last broke out in Tears and wept aloud.<br>  Now Father's, Mothers, Childrens Cries unite,<br>  And in each others Breasts fresh grief excite.<br>  Confed'rate Sighs and Tears conspire to show<br>  A perfect triumph of Victorious Woe.<br>  Yet constant <i> Clovis</i>  still maintain'd the Field,<br>  And tho' o'erwhelm'd with force refus'd to yield.<br>  So when a noble Oak that long has stood<br>  High in the Air, the Beauty of the Wood<br>  Is shock'd by stormy Winds, he either way<br>  Bends to the Earth his Head with mighty Sway.<br>  His lab'ring Roots disturb the neighb'ring Ground,<br>  And makes a heaving Earthquake all around.<br>  Yet fast he stands, and the loud Storm defys,<br>  His Roots still keep the Earth, his head the Skys.<br>  So did great <i> Clovis</i>  in the Tempest rock,<br>  And firmly so withstood the Dreadful shock.<br>  But when the Fury and the boyling Tyde<br>  Of his Tumultuous Passion did subside,<br>  Good Heav'ns he cry'd! this is too much to bear,<br>  In such a Storm what Mortal Force can steer?<br>  Nature Extended lys upon the Rack,<br>  And all her shatter'd Frame begins to Crack<br>  Th' impetuous Stress of Passion bears me down,<br>  And the high tyde dos sinking Reason drown.<br>  To bear this mighty weight Heav'n grant support,<br>  All Tortures after this will be but Sport.<br>  The Bitterness and Sting of Death is gone,<br>  When this sad part is past, this Suff'ring done.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paus'd, and then to <i> Merula</i>  he cry'd,<br>  You now your utmost Strength and Skill have try'd.<br>  You've chang'd indeed th' Attack with Wondrous Art,<br>  Quitting your Reason to engage my Heart.<br>  You Wisely your Artillery apply'd<br>  To the most tender, and defenceless side.<br>  You did discreetly think the task not hard<br>  To gain the illman'd Post, which Passions guard.<br>  You thought to win me by your Artful Prayer,<br>  Because I lov'd you and I thought you Fair.<br>  'Tis true when you your Innocence maintain'd<br>  By no Defection, no Rebellion stain'd,<br>  You shone Illustrious in your Heav'nly Sphear,<br>  And lovely as a <i> Seraph</i>  did appear.<br>  But now your Crime your beauteous Eyes disarms<br>  Losing your Piety, you lose your Charms.<br>  O'er your bright Form a Night of Guilt is spread,<br>  And hangs in <i> Stygian</i>  Clouds around your head.<br>  Like a fallen Angel <i> Merula</i>  has lost<br>  The charming Graces which her Form could boast;<br>  Which now no longer can afford Delight,<br>  But like the Sun Eclips'd dos all affright,<br>  And with a dying Splendor pains our sight.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think not that I could Ease and Life refuse,<br>  And Ignominious Death and Torment chuse,<br>  That I of Bosom Friends could farewel take,<br>  And Children dearer then my Life forsake,<br>  Did not th' Almighty this hard task Enjoyn,<br>  And lend the mighty Aid of Grace Divine.<br>  Down to the Yoke I struggling nature bend<br>  Rather than his Supream Command offend.<br>  I am not fond of Shame, nor do I take<br>  Pleasure in Torment, for the Torment's sake.<br>  I do not Court the Cross, nor Wrongs invite<br>  Nor in Distress, and Ruin take delight.<br>  I in Obedience, not in Pain rejoyce<br>  And rather Suff'ring make, than Sin my Choice.<br>  Nor may our transient Sorrow be compar'd<br>  With that bright Crown, that shall our Love Reward,<br>  With Heav'n's transporting, and unmeasur'd Bliss<br>  And Life Eternal in Exchange for this,<br>  'Tis for the Prize we chuse the Painful Race,<br>  And for the Crown that we the Cross embrace.<br>  Here on a dark and dangerous Sea we steer<br>  Tost on th' uncertain Waves of Hope and Fear.<br>  Oft dash'd on Rocks, oft in wild Tempests lost,<br>  Oft chas'd by <i> Corsairs</i>  to an unknown Coast.<br>  And shall th' affrighted Voyager recoil<br>  When Heav'n in Pity to his Fears and Toil,<br>  Shall kindly tow him to the happy Strand,<br>  And on the Shores of Light the shatter'd Vessel Land?<br>  Would Trav'llours fry'd with <i> Lybia</i> 's burning Heat<br>  Faint with their Labour, Hunger, Thirst and Sweat,<br>  Complain if one in Pity would Convey<br>  Them to their wish'd for home a shorter Way?<br>  Men who from Heav'n derive their noble Birth<br>  Cast on a Forreign Clime live here on Earth;<br>  Where the wild Natives with loud Clamor chase<br>  To Woods and Caves the mild and God-like Race.<br>  They are insulted, vext, pursu'd and spoil'd,<br>  Both for their own and Master's sake revil'd.<br>  And should not these be willing to retreat<br>  From such a rude, Inhospitable Seat?<br>  Should Strangers us'd so ill, and so Opprest<br>  Be courted to their Home and to their Rest?<br>  Should such as these at their departure grieve,<br>  And drag'd, like lingring <i> Lot,</i>  this <i> Sodom</i>  leave?<br>  What dismal Seats the dying Saints forsake,<br>  To what a Blissful Place their Flight they take?<br>  There where th' Almighty's

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Revolted <i> Merula</i>  reflect<br>  On that vast Woe which Rebels must expect.<br>  Who to appease a Man their God Incense<br>  To scape Man's wrath provoke Omnipotence:<br>  Who on Almighty Goodness can't rely,<br>  But from their Saviour's bloody Banner fly,<br>  And to preserve their Lives their Faith deny.<br>  Their timorous flight no Safety can afford,<br>  They fly to meet a more destructive Sword.<br>  What if by Guilt they shun a Mortal Foe,<br>  They run but on his Arms, whose surer blow<br>  Can wound and sink them to the Shades below:<br>  Where they Alternate Death must still repeat<br>  In Piercing Cold, or unextinguish'd Heat;<br>  Where mighty Vengeance they must ever bear<br>  O'erwhelm'd with Wrath, and torn with wild Despair.<br>  Besides when Men from fiery Tryals run,<br>  They meet worse Torments here, than those they shun.<br>  Dos not their Guilt their tremb'ling Souls affright,<br>  And place th' Almighty's

Afflict your Soul, and lash you for your fault?<br>  An angry Judge your tender Saviour's made,<br>  Of whom you were asham'd, now are you not afraid?<br>  Your thoughts of God must have Amazement

dissolve to Tears, let every Vein<br>  A stream of Water, not of Blood contain.<br>  Thro' all the winding Channels to my Eyes<br>  Let unexhausted Stores of Moisture rise.<br>  Let no sufficient

Will break my Stores up, my Abyss of Woe.<br>  Descend my Tears, in Cataracts flow down,<br>  Me, and my load of Guilt together drown.<br>  Let mighty Torrents from my Eye-balls roll,<br>  Fit to dilute th' Almighty's wrathful Bowl.<br>  Lord, strike this Marble Heart, thy powerful Stroke<br>  Will make a Flood gush from the cleaving Rock.<br>  O draw all Nature's Sluces up, and drain<br>  Her Magazines, which liquid Stores contain.<br>  My Guilt with hideous Crys do's me pursue,<br>  O, let me make the Poets Fable true;<br>  To shun the grisly, formidable Shape,<br>  And from the Monster's Fury to escape,<br>  Melting in Tears let me a River grow,<br>  And in a swift, complaining Water flow.<br>  What method is there, <i> Clovis,</i>  to decline<br>  The black, impending Storm of Wrath Divine?<br>  What Balm can my tormenting Pain appease?<br>  What can procure my wounded Spirit ease?<br>  How to my troubled Breast shall I restore<br>  That Heav'nly Peace which I enjoy'd before?<br>  Oh, what can smooth th' Almighty's frowning Brow,<br>  Arrest his lifted Hand, and make him drop the blow?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ceas'd.

Now you appear<br>  Fair as before, and are to me as dear.<br>  Now you regain your Form, and lovely Charms<br>  And as before are welcom to my Arms.<br>  Heav'n will embrace you too, now you return<br>  And your late fall with pure Contrition mourn. <br>  Heav'n's always ready to afford Relief<br>  To pious Sorrow and ingenuous Grief.<br>  When Penitents with self-displeasure burn,<br>  And to themselves, and to their God return.<br>  Th' Almighty mov'd with Pity will not stay,<br>  But will advance to meet them on their way.<br>  Their Errors he forgets, revokes their Doom<br>  And leads his rescu'd Sons in Triumph home.<br>  Your humble Sorrow gives even Angels Joy,<br>  Who to protect you will their Care employ.<br>  The way to make your Peace which you demand<br>  Is plain, you must the fiery Trial stand.<br>  You must your God before the World confess,<br>  And publick Shame, for publick Crimes express.<br>  We must without debate, without delay,<br>  Boldly advance where Conscience leads the way.<br>  Obedience only can our Peace secure:<br>  No Mind is easie long, that is not pure.<br>  You must Obey even at your Blood's expence,<br>  You must to Life prefer your Innocence.<br>  Regard the Joy that is before you set,<br>  View but the Prize, and you will ne'er retreat.<br>  You can't too dear Immortal Glory reap,<br>  What e'er you give, the purchase still is cheap.<br>  In Vertues Cause whate'er your Suff'rings are,<br>  Heav'n is oblig'd your Losses to repair.<br>  If you with publick Fortitude will own<br>  Your Saviour's Cause, you win the promis'd Crown.<br>  This Favourite Intercessor can alone<br>  Fit Merit plead th' Almighty to atone.<br>  Only his Blood can purge your guilty Stain,<br>  Without this Aid, your Tears descend in vain.<br>  Would you succeed in Christian Warfare, joyn<br>  Sincere Obedience to Belief Divine.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceas'd. And thus did <i> Merula</i>  reply,<br>  Oh, let not Heav'n its promis'd Aid deny,<br>  And I with Courage will the Cross embrace,<br>  And stare the King of Terrors in the Face.<br>  Both by your words and brave example fir'd,<br>  And with fresh power deriv'd from Heav'n, inspir'd,<br>  Back to the Field from whence I fled I'll come,<br>  And with new Life the Christian War resume.<br>  Faint from the painful Course I once withdrew,<br>  But now return, invited back by you.<br>  I will no more refuse the Christian Yoke,<br>  Nor him forsake, who never his forsook.<br>  From this vile World together we'll retire,<br>  And in Heav'n's Cause together will expire.<br>  With equal swiftness we a breast will fly,<br>  And hand in hand ascend th' Empyreal Sky.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here he embrac'd her in his Arms, and said,<br>  Now all my Cares and anxious Thoughts are fled.<br>  Kind Heav'n assist, that we may stedfast prove,<br>  And then Reward the labour of our Love.<br>  Then he with God-like Language did proceed<br>  The sacred flame within her Breast to feed.<br>  How nobly he describ'd the bright Reward,<br>  Th' Eternal Joys for Conquering Saints prepar'd!<br>  What high and great Idea's did he draw<br>  Of future Bliss, then cry'd, oh <i> Merula,</i> <br>  These glorious Triumphs will our Suff'rings Crown,<br>  And these blest Joys will quickly be our own.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they proceeded in Divine debate,<br>  And Heav'nly Language fitted to their State,<br>  Till Night was worn, and the declining Moon<br>  Had now past over her Nocturnal Noon.<br>  When <i> Uriel</i>  brighter than the Morning Star,<br>  And swift as Light'ning glancing thro' the Air,<br>  Did to the Prison, from above, repair.<br>  Beauty Divine, and Grace ineffable,<br>  Did on his Cheeks and God-like Features dwell.<br>  His Eyes, like Diamonds set in polish'd Gold,<br>  Did a bright Heav'n of Light and Joy unfold.<br>  Unfading Youth did pure, Ambrosial Red,<br>  Mild Air, and blooming Honours on him spred.<br>  His Golden Hair did on his Shoulders shine<br>  Like Locks of Sun-beams curl'd with Art Divine.<br>  From his bright Face broke such Illustrious Rays<br>  As all blest Minds imbibe, who stedfast gaze<br>  Upon the dazling Beatific Sight,<br>  Ravish'd with Joy, and overwhelm'd with Light.<br>  Immortal Life his Heav'nly Mould did move,<br>  And thro' his radiant Limbs the Vital Glory strove.<br>  Ent'ring the Room the Seraph Silence broke,<br>  And thus the Pious Confessors bespoke:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th' Almighty whose all-penetrating Eye<br>  Do's search the Heart, and all its thoughts descry;<br>  Who views the bent and purpose of your Mind,<br>  Do's your Intention fixt and stedfast find,<br>  To part with Life for your Religion's sake,<br>  And do's the Will for full performance take.<br>  Me therefore in Compassion he has sent<br>  From his high Throne, your Suff'rings to prevent.<br>  I to your Friends will safely you convey,<br>  Then boldly follow where I lead the Way.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, and soon the Constant <i> Clovis</i>  found<br>  His Fetters loos'd, and fallen upon the ground.<br>  One Child the Father, one the Mother took,<br>  Who at the wondrous Stranger's Presence shook.<br>  With Fear and Joy possest, without delay<br>  They follow, and their Heav'nly Guide obey.<br>  Th' advancing Seraph touch'd the Prison Door<br>  With the bright Rod which in his hand he bore.<br>  Th' obsequious Gate obey'd, and open flew,<br>  Leaving them free their Safety to pursue.<br>  Whom to the Camp the Angel did convey,<br>  Where strong entrench'd the Valiant <i> Britons</i>  lay.<br>  That done, thro' all the spacious Fields of Air,<br>  To his Celestial Seat he did repair.<br>  <br>  <br>  <b> BOOK IX</b>  <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Things in <i> Gallia</i>  past.

display'd.<br>  They spoon'd away before the shoving Wind,<br>  And left retreating Cliffs and Rocks behind.<br>  They cut the Ocean, while Officious Gales<br>  Swell'd the Capacious Bosoms of their

slowly roll'd along.<br>  With so much Joy King <i> Arthur</i>  was receiv'd,<br>  And thus attended at the Camp arriv'd.<br>  Where to his high Pavilion soon they bring,<br>  Rich Wine, and Meats, Refreshments for their King.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Supper ended, <i> Arthur</i>  did relate<br>  How he in Peace had left <i> Britannia</i> 's State.<br>  And what amazing Dangers him befel,<br>  Caus'd by the Malice of the Prince of Hell,<br>  Both on the Waves and in <i> Pomona</i> 's Isle,<br>  All which he vanquish'd with unwearied toil.<br>  Then did he hear his Chiefs

When Christians publick Adoration pay<br>  To Heav'n, and fervid with Devotion raise<br>  In rapt'rous Hymns their great Creator's Praise:<br>  And then with awful Reverence and Fear,<br>  From Sacred

And from the Sacred Oracles he brought<br>  What in their minds Conceptions Just and Right<br>  Of the first Glorious Being might excite.<br>  What might Create Dependance on his Power,<br>  And by engaging Heav'n make Conquest sure.<br>  And thus his Wise Instructions did Commence<br>  With Zeal Divine, and rapid Eloquence.<br>  The Pagan World ev'n in its darkest Night,<br>  Receiv'd from

to meet their Foes.<br>  To render Heav'n Propitious to their Arms,<br>  Christians are more oblig'd to use the Charms<br>  Of pure Devotion, who more clearly know<br>  What Blessings from Divine

The Turns of Empire, and th' Events of War,<br>  Result from his Supream, directing Care.<br>  Those who the Self-existent Cause conceive,<br>  And all his Glorious Attributes believe,<br>  Who own his Greatness, and unbounded Power<br>  To crush his Foes, and Vot'ries to secure;<br>  His Justice, that with Threats the Bad deters,<br>  And great Rewards on Upright Men confers,<br>  His unchang'd Love and Truth that never errs:<br>  His Faithfulness, that ne'er forsakes his own,<br>  But stands as fix'd as his Eternal Throne,<br>  That to his Servants still he Succour brings,<br>  Gather'd beneath his kind protecting Wings.<br>  Those Saints who such a Deity conceive,<br>  With strong Devotion arm'd, will ever strive<br>  With Heav'n, and first begin their Conquests there,<br>  Before

binds the Billows in with Cords of Sand.<br>  He broke th' Abyss up for the watry Stores,<br>  And plac'd before the Waves his Rocky Doors.<br>  He markt out for them their appointed Seat,<br>  And said, Come hitherto, and then retreat.<br>  He in a Ballance weighs the lofty Hills,<br>  And stooping down with Ease takes up the Isles,<br>  Which torn up from their Roots appear so light,<br>  That when he poises them, they lose their weight.<br>  By him the spacious Heav'ns are over-span'd,<br>  And the Sea's lost when held within his hand.<br>  How swift his flaming Darts of Light'ning fly,<br>  Shot from the gaping Engines of the Sky?<br>  His Voice of Thunder do's his Wrath proclaim,<br>  And shakes affrighted Nature's rocking Frame.<br>  Whene'er he bows the Heav'ns, and thence

go,<br>  And make a sinful Land Heav'n's Vengeance know.<br>  The glitt'ring Spoiler not to be withstood,<br>  Triumphs in Wounds, and Death, and reeks in Blood.<br>  Enthron'd, on slaughter'd Heaps the Tyrant reigns,<br>  And spreads with ghastly Spoils the Crimson Plains.<br>  Where the red Glutton labours to asswage,<br>  With bloody Riot his insatiate Rage.<br>  Thus while the high Divine Commission lasts,<br>  Realms to Destruction doom'd, th' bright Destroyer wasts:<br>  But when th' Almighty bids the Spoiler stand,<br>  He stops his Course, and owns the great Command.<br>  He choaks th' Infernal Throat of Howling War,<br>  And the black Mouths of Horror and Despair.<br>  All Martial Noise, Uproar, and Tumult, cease,<br>  Husht by the soft melodious Voice of Peace.<br>  Long war-like Spears are chang'd for Shepherds Crooks,<br>  And Swords and Shields for Spades' and pruning Hooks.<br>  The Woolly Flocks again adorn the Hills,<br>  And Rural Care the busy Vally fills.<br>  The grisly shapes of Death and Terror gone,<br>  New Life and Joy the smiling Regions crown.<br>  So when a black Tempestuous Night is past<br>  In which loud Winds have lofty Tow'rs defac'd<br>  The

the troubled Empire of the Air.<br>  The Sun's bright Beams the reeking Meads adorn,<br>  And chearful Lab'rers to their toil return.<br>  He in set bounds do's wild Ambition keep,<br>  And to her say's, as to the raging Deep,<br>  Here stop before the Bars which I have laid.<br>  Here shall thy proud insulting Waves be staid, <br>  They strive in vain these Banks to overflow,<br>  Thus far they shall, but shall no farther go.<br>  The Fate of Empires flow from his Command,<br>  And all the Hearts of Kings are in his hand.<br>  Which by his skill are guided and inclin'd<br>  Ends to

<br>  <b> BOOK X</b>  <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as the rising Sun's victorious Light<br>  Had Scal'd, and pass'd the gloomy Mounds of Night.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Partys who to beat the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great <i> Arthur</i>  with Heroic Ardor warm'd<br>  His Weapons took and for the Battel Arm'd.<br>  Round his strong Legs he made his Pieces fast<br>  With Silver Studds, and Golden

the Morn.<br>  A Purple Scarf, like mild <i> Aurora</i> 's pride,<br>  Enrich'd with Golden Tassels grac'd his Side.<br>  Next, like the Moon at full, his spacious Shield<br>  Blaz'd on his Arm and dazled all the Field.<br>  As Forges full of melted Oar by night<br>  Appear at distance to the Travellers sight,<br>  Where brawny Smith besmear'd with Smoke and Sweat.<br>  For Ships of War unweildy Anchors beat.<br>  So did the Warriour's Burnish'd Buckler glow,<br>  And such fierce Light did from the Metal flow.<br>  His mighty Fauchion which of all the Field,<br>  Two of the strongest Chiefs could scarcely weild,<br>  Whose fatal Edge so many Heros felt,<br>  Hung down suspended in his glorious Belt.<br>  Then his long Spear he took which in his hand<br>  When firmly grip'd shook like an

pass,<br>  The fiery Dust at every blow that flys<br>  And glaring Light vex the Spectator's Eyes.<br>  The <i> Briton</i> 's Arms shone thus excessive bright,<br>  Darted keen Glances and uneasy

the <i> Negro</i> 's hand, and tost around<br>  His generous Foam that Whiten'd all the ground.<br>  In his hot Mouth he champt the Golden Bit,<br>  And paw'd the Vally with his thund'ring Feet.<br>  The King advanc'd, and in his Martial Heat<br>  Mounting the Steed, and leaping cross the Seat<br>  Such was the clanking of his Arms as made,<br>  By the surprize his starting Friends affraid.<br>  The fiery Beast Impatient of the Rein,<br>  Curveted, Bounc'd, and Bounded o'er the Plain.<br>  The Eagle scarcely flew so swift and strong,<br>  When she to Heav'n, as ancient Poets sung,<br>  From

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trumpet's cheerful Voice the Region fills,<br>  Redoubled by the Rocks and ecchoing Hills.<br>  The Heav'ns with Arms and war-like noise resound,<br>  And fiery Coursers shake

prospect of King <i> Clotar</i> 's Horse.<br>  The numerous Squadrons rang'd in Battel stood,<br>  And look'd at distance like an Iron Wood.<br>  As when a gathering Tempest do's arise<br>  With

Youth your Ensigns dread.<br>  What Heros ever could your Arms resist?<br>  When have your Squadrons fought, and Conquest mist?<br>  <i> Arthur,</i>  'tis true, did once some Troops defeat,<br>  But must not think his Vict'ry to repeat.<br>  The plying Infantry by giving Way,<br>  The great Disorder caus'd that lost the Day.<br>  You never were engag'd, you ne'er could show<br>  The Fire with which you us'd to Charge the Foe.<br>  <i> Clotar</i>  on you his Cavalry relys,<br>  And by your Arms the <i> British</i>  Power defys.<br>  'Tis by the Cavalry the <i> Franks</i>  have done<br>  Their mighty Deeds, and gain'd their chief Renown.<br>  Your Valour must determine <i> Gallia</i> 's Fate,<br>  You are the Bulwark, that protects her State.<br>  Who can withstand, brave Men, the

ended when his Courser's Flanks<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  gor'd, and Sprung amidst the Ranks.<br>  His first projected Spear <i> Bermondo</i>  slew,<br>  Piercing his Cuirass, Shield, and Body thro':<br>  Drunk with the Wound which inwardly did bleed<br>  The giddy <i> Frank</i>  sat tottering on his Steed.<br>  The Courser's Reins fell from his feeble hand,<br>  Then down he headlong fell, and prest the Sand.<br>  Next to the sight strong <i> Osbal</i>  did advance,<br>  But in his Breast receiv'd the <i> Briton</i> 's Lance.<br>  As Thunder struck from Heav'n, the mighty <i> Gaul</i>  <br>  Fell down, and shook the Vally with his fall.<br>  The Conq'ring <i> Briton</i>  o'er his Body rode,<br>  And deep into the Sand his reeking Entrails trod.<br>  Stout <i> Monlac</i>  next stood in the <i> Briton</i> 's way,<br>  And proudly hop'd the Victor's Course to stay.<br>  Thro' his right Eye the Monarch's Weapon past,<br>  And pierc'd his Skull which steel in vain encas'd.<br>  He tumbled from his Seat, and on the ground<br>  He felt his Life departing from his Wound.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then by <i> Garontes</i>  cast a mighty Spear<br>  Cut thro' the downy Bosom of

Indignation fir'd,<br>  Flew to the Charge, and with an oblique stroke<br>  His mighty Fauchion thro' the Helmet broke.<br>  He did his Mouth from Ear to Ear divide,<br>  And from the Wound gush'd out a reeking Tyde.<br>  His sever'd Jaw depending ghastly show'd,<br>  And from his Throat he Cough'd up Teeth and Blood.<br>  He fell, and while he lay in torturing Pain,<br>  Hot Coursers trod to Mire his Head and Brain.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Onvil</i>  advanc'd the <i> Briton</i>  to repel,<br>  But on his Crest the mighty Fauchion fell.<br>  The noble stroke did the strong Captain stun,<br>  Who dropt his Sword, and Shield, and in a Swoon,<br>  A while lay sensless on his Courser's Main,<br>  Then fell, and lay stretcht out amidst the Slain.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Martel,</i>  who still the hottest Battel sought,<br>  And from the Combate frequent Laurels brought,<br>  Advanc'd the Monarch's progress to arrest,<br>  And hurl'd his massy Spear against his Breast.<br>  On <i>

Off leap'd the Head, and murm'ring flew away,<br>  Then gasping in the Dust, and twinkling lay.<br>  So swiftly did the sev'ring Fauchion go,<br>  So quick, so strong, so suddain was the Blow,<br>  That still the Trunk, tho' of the Head depriv'd,<br>  Preserv'd its Seat, and scarce the loss perceiv'd: <br>  A while a ghastly Prospect there it staid,<br>  And from the Neck the bloody Fountains play'd,<br>  Which high into the Air their Purple Streams convey'd,<br>  Then down it tumbled, and amidst the Dead,<br>  Lay at a distance from the sever'd Head.<br>  Next <i> Oroban</i>  who grew in

the King, but th' unexpected Steel<br>  The wounded <i> Frank</i>  did in his Bosom feel.<br>  Approaching Fate he did in vain resist,<br>  Dying he fell, and curst the lying Priest.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monarch then sprang forward to Assail,<br>  <i> Lansac,</i>  confiding in his Coat of Mail.<br>  The Fauchion thro' the Coat soon passage found,<br>  His Shoulder cleft, and made a ghastly Wound.<br>  The fainting <i> Gaul</i>  fell headlong from his seat<br>  And lay extended at the Courser's feet.<br>  Then thus the Pious King the <i> Frank</i>  bespoke,<br>  At last thy Crimes have met th' avenging stroke.<br>  How many Christians has thy Savage hand<br>  Rack'd and destroy'd, pleas'd with thy Lord's Command?<br>  No Torments, no Destruction could asswage<br>  Thy thirst of Blood, and Persecuting Rage.<br>  Think on the Arts thy Malice did invent,<br>  T'afflict the Poor, and vex the Innocent.<br>  Now thou must suffer for th' atrocious Guilt,<br>  For all the Blood thy impious hand has spilt.<br>  Then his bright Spear he thro' his Body thrust,<br>  Spur'd on his Steed, and crush'd him in the Dust.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Torbet</i>  stood next,

turn'd his Courser's head,<br>  And from the dreadful danger would have fled.<br>  But then desparing to escape by Flight,<br>  And yet affraid to undertake the Fight,<br>  Trembling and Pale with fear himself he threw<br>  At <i> Arthur</i> 's Feet, and thus for Life did sue.<br>  Pity, great Prince, as well as Courage show,<br>  And turn from <i> Torbet</i> 's head your fatal Blow.<br>  My

 He said. The King the trembling Coward left<br>  By his own Fears almost of Life bereft.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Bramar</i>  trusting to his mighty Force<br>  Came boldly on t'oppose the Monarch's Course.<br>  Proudly he rein'd his generous, milk-white Steed<br>  As <i> Thracian</i>  bold, swift as <i> Iberian</i>  Breed.<br>  The <i> Briton</i> 's Spear aim'd at his shining Crest,<br>  Missing the Rider struck the prauncing Beast,<br>  And entring deep lay buried in his Chest.<br>  He on his hinder Feet himself did rear,<br>  And with the foremost paw'd, and beat the Air;<br>  Then on the ground he fell, and with his fall<br>  The groaning Courser crush'd the war-like <i> Gaul</i> .<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  advanc'd, and gave the fatal Wound;<br>  The Weapon fixt the

Waves.<br>  O'er Billows thronging Heads the Victor rides,<br>  Cuts thro', and all the watry Host divides.<br>  With equal Force the Valiant <i> Briton</i>  flew<br>  Amidst the Ranks, and charg'd as

the Plain<br>  And dropt the dying <i> Frank</i>  amidst the Slain.<br>  Next the brave Warriour did his Javelin throw<br>  At <i> Ulna</i> 's Breast, which tho' it mist the Foe,<br>  The glittering point his Steed's right Eye-ball past,<br>  And stuck within the bloody <i> Orbit</i>  fast.<br>  High in the Air he rose, then to the ground<br>  He backward fell, expiring with the wound.<br>  Struck Breathless with the Fall, the noble <i> Frank</i>  <br>  Lay with his Shoulders on the Courser's Flank.<br>  Quick to the ground the <i> Briton</i>  from his Seat<br>  With ardor leap'd, his Conquest to compleat.<br>  He laid his left Hand on the Warriour's Crest,<br>  And with his right Hand stab'd him in the Breast.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Andolan</i>  of <i> Ammon</i> 's noble Line<br>  Born on the flowry Banks of Silver Sein,<br>  Spur'd his hot Steed, and griping fast his Spear,<br>  Ran at the <i> Briton</i>  with a full Career.<br>  Illustrious <i> Osor</i>  ne'er

their Contest to decide<br>  In rude Rencounters meet upon the Tide,<br>  No more the Sailors can their Decks maintain,<br>  But with the Shock are forc'd into the Main. <br>  Their feet recover'd, soon the Champions drew<br>  Their flashing Blades, and to the Combate flew.<br>  Forwards stretcht out they did their Bodys bend,<br>  And with uplifted Shields their Heads defend.<br>  Vast strokes were now discharg'd on either side,<br>  Strokes that with ease would unarm'd Limbs divide.<br>  Their Armour was deform'd with numerous dints,<br>  And their bruis'd Bucklers shew'd the Fauchions prints.<br>  For Conquest long the Captains did contend,<br>  And in vast strokes their Martial Vigour spend.<br>  Still both the Combatants maintain'd their ground,<br>  Neither had given, nor yet receiv'd a Wound.<br>  At last their Strength with equal honour spent,<br>  To end the noble Combate both consent.<br>  The valiant Chiefs in friendly manner part,<br>  Praising each other's Strength, each other's Art.<br>  The generous <i> Briton</i>  to the <i> Gallic</i>  Lord<br>  Did for a present give a famous Sword.<br>  The Haft an Agate was from <i> India</i>  brought,<br>  Where inlaid Trees, and Birds by Nature wrought<br>  Appear'd distinct and fair, as Ants and Bees<br>  Kill'd and Entomb'd in drops from Amber Trees.<br>  With their best Skill <i> Iberian</i>  Masters made<br>  Of purest temper'd Steel the faithful Blade.<br>  The ample Scabbard which the Sword did hold,<br>  Shone bright with glitt'ring Gems and Studs of Gold.<br>  This Sword <i> Nazaleod</i>  from rich <i>

Nazaleod</i>  to great <i> Osor</i>  gave<br>  Whose Arms did once his Life in Battel save.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble <i> Frank</i>  a Saddle did present<br>  Glorious with Gems, with Work magnificent. <br>  The Pummel was an Ivory Lyon's Head<br>  That fiercly grin'd, as those in <i> Lybia</i>  bred.<br>  The Seat rich Crimson Velvet cover'd o'er,<br>  Like that exported from <i> Liguria</i> 's Shore.<br>  Th' embroader'd Skirts were all with Gold besmear'd,<br>  Where Figures wrought with curious Art appear'd.<br>  A Leopard's Skin th' appending Housing was<br>  From <i> Afric</i>  brought, and grac'd with Silver Paws.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere brave <i> Clovis</i>  did the Foe pursue,<br>  And first his massy Spear at <i> Ortan</i>  threw.<br>  The temper'd Shield could not it's Force Arrest,<br>  It pass'd the Plys and pierc'd the Warriour's Breast.<br>  The secret Springs of Life the Weapon found,<br>  And broke them open with a fatal Wound.<br>  The Spear fixt in his Breast, some time he hung,<br>  And with his left hand to the Saddle clung,<br>  But with his Right held fast the Courser's Main<br>  And thus a while his Body did sustain.<br>  But Death unstrung his Nerves, and loos'd his hold,<br>  Then in the Sand th' expiring Captain roll'd.<br>  Then with his Battel Ax great <i> Clovis</i>  flew<br>  At <i> Maronac,</i>  and cleft his Shoulder thro'.<br>  Down on the Ground the Arm dis-joynted dropt,<br>  As a great Limb falls from a Poplar lopt.<br>  Strait the dismember'd <i> Frank,</i>  a fearful Sight,<br>  Wheel'd off in vain to save his Life by Flight.<br>  Warm streams flew out from every sever'd vein<br>  And markt with tracks of Blood the Dusty Plain.<br>  Defrauded of his Strength the feeble <i> Gaul</i>  <br>  At last did headlong from his Courser fall.<br>  Cold Death forbad his lab'ring Heart to beat,<br>  And in his blood supprest the vital Heat.<br>  Then <i> Carobel</i>  who had advanc'd his name<br>  By learned Arts, and Skill in Nature's Fame,<br>  Bold too in Arms, and to the Camp inur'd,<br>  Fell in <i> Lutetia</i> 's fields by <i> Clovis</i>  Sword:<br>  Thro' Helm and Skull the Fauchion passage found,<br>  Cleft thro' the Brain, and ruin'd with the Wound<br>  The curious Imag'ry by Fancy wrought,<br>  All Mem'ry's Cells, and all the Moulds of Thought.<br>  Next <i> Alloman</i>  lay dead, <i> Lugdunum</i> 's Pride,<br>  And beauteous <i> Ormal</i>  stretcht out by his Side.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Capellan</i>  also signaliz'd his Arms,<br>  And boldly prest amidst the <i> Gallic</i>  Swarms.<br>  He slew at <i> Lucan</i>  with a full Career,<br>  And thro' his Bosom past his fatal Spear.<br>  His second <i> Fromel</i>  kill'd, the next he threw<br>  Young <i> Lamar</i>  pierc'd, the next <i> Obella</i>  slew.<br>  Then his Projected Dart transfixt the Head<br>  Of <i> Grutar</i> 's Steed, which on the field lay dead.<br>  Across the Beast on which before he rode<br>  Ghastly with Gore and Dust the Warriour strode<br>  With his strong Arm he did his Spear protend,<br>  And with his burnish'd Shield his Head defend.<br>  A while he strove, and bravely kept his ground,<br>  Till the fierce <i> Briton</i> 's Spear it's passage found<br>  Thro' Helm and Head, and then with Death opprest<br>  He fell, and lay across th' extended Beast.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Valiant <i> Clovis</i>  so much Honour won,<br>  Elsewhere like Wonders were by <i> Lucius</i>  done.<br>  First in his way by luckless Fortune stood,<br>  Young <i> Medolan</i>  of <i> Trabor</i> 's noble Blood.<br>  The Javelin thro' his Belly made it's way,<br>  And in his wounded Entrails buried lay.<br>  The Youth, so much he was to Arms inclin'd,<br>  Left unenjoy'd his beauteous Bride behind;<br>  He's now embrac'd by Death' s unwelcom Arms,<br>  And to another quits her Maiden Charms.<br>  Brave <i> Arcan</i>  burning with a Martial Flame,<br>  To aid his wounded Brother swiftly came;<br>  But felt the <i> Briton</i> 's Steel within his Veins,<br>  Which thro' his Armour pierc'd the Warriour's Reins.<br>  Upon his Seat he could no longer stay<br>  But fell, and cross his dying Brother lay.<br>  Their mournful Friends look'd on, but were afraid,<br>  So great the Peril was, to give them Aid.<br>  So when a Lyon roaming o'er the Lawns,<br>  Descrys the Thicket where her tender Fawns<br>  The Doe as she believ'd did safely lay,<br>  In do's he leap, and tear the panting Prey<br>  The Doe at distance do's their Fate bewail,<br>  But dares not come the Murd'rer to Assail.<br>  While Valiant <i> Lucius</i>  such destruction made,<br>  Against the Chief advanc'd a strong Brigade;<br>  And opening to the Right and Left, the Foes<br>  On every side the Leader did enclose.<br>  The noble <i> Briton</i>  did himself defend,<br>  While Clouds of Spears from every part they send.<br>  The missive War upon his Buckler rung,<br>  And showers of fruitless Deaths around him sung.<br>  So when fierce Dogs and clam'rous Swains surround<br>  A mighty Boar in neighb'ring Mountains found;<br>  His Bristles high erected on his Back,<br>  The raging Beast withstands the Foes attack:<br>  He whets his dreadful Tusks, and from afar<br>  He foams, and flourishes the Ivory War.<br>  The cautious Huntsmen at a distance rage,<br>  Cast all their Darts, but dare not close engage.<br>  At last the <i> Briton</i>  from an unknown Spear,<br>  Receiv'd a painful Wound beneath the Ear.<br>  The striving Blood did thro' his Armour spout<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  observing gave a mighty shout.<br>  Thus wounded and opprest, the <i> British</i>  Chief<br>  Call'd to his Friends aloud to bring Relief.<br>  It chanc'd that mighty <i> Trelon</i>  then was near,<br>  Who to his Squadron cry'd, the Voice I hear<br>  Is <i> Lucius,</i>  who encircled with the Foe,<br>  Contends in vain to cut his passage thro'.<br>  To bring him off we'll force the <i> Gallic</i>  Ranks.<br>  He said, and strait he spur'd his Courser's Flanks,<br>  And shaking in his hand his glitt'ring Lance,<br>  To Charge the <i> Franks</i>  with Fury did advance.<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  disperst when <i> Trelon</i>  first appear'd,<br>  So much they all his famous Courage fear'd.<br>  So when fierce Wolves have seiz'd a fainting Deer,<br>  But newly wounded by the Huntsman's Spear.<br>  With reeking Blood they feast their hungry Jaws,<br>  And the warm Entrails pant beneath their Paws.<br>  But if a Lyon comes, the awful Sight<br>  Do's from their Prey the prowling Race affright.<br>  Then his bright Spear with Fury cast betwixt<br>  The Flank and Chest, great <i> Tolna</i> 's Steed transfixt.<br>  The generous Beast beneath the Rider fell:<br>  <i> Tolna</i>  th' invading Tempest to repel,<br>  Springing with Vigour from the Courser's back,<br>  Advanc'd on foot great <i> Trelon</i>  to attack.<br>  And that the <i> Briton</i> 's Fury might be stay'd,<br>  His Left Hand on the Courser's Reins he laid,<br>  And held his flaming Fauchion in the Right,<br>  Resolving thus he would maintain the Fight.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  Steed that Swords and Spears disdain'd,<br>  With Indignation foam'd to be restrain'd:<br>  <i> Trelon</i>  enrag'd, divided at a blow<br>  His Arm, which dropt and let the Courser go.<br>  The generous Steed finding the Rein releast,<br>  Sprang forth, and struck stout <i> Tolna</i>  in the Breast,<br>  Who breathless fell, with endless Night opprest. <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time, at distance <i> Arbel</i>  bravely fought,<br>  And wondrous Fame by great Atchievements sought.<br>  His Courage, Strength, and Conduct often try'd<br>  Made all the <i> Gallic</i>  Youth in him confide<br>  As their Chief Champion, and their surest guide.<br>  He spur'd his fiery Steed, and forwards sprung<br>  Amidst the Troops, and broke th' opposing Throng.<br>  Brave <i> Gomar</i>  first his fury did withstand,<br>  But while to cast his Spear he rais'd his hand,<br>  The <i> Frank</i> 's bright Lance between his Armour's joynt<br>  Beneath his Arm-pit past its glitt'ring point.<br>  Deep in his breathing Lungs the Weapon lay<br>  The <i> Neustrian</i> 's fell, and saw no more the Day.<br>  <i> Coril</i>  advanc'd to undertake the Fight,<br>  And threw his Weapon with prodigious might.<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  inclin'd his head, and heard the Spear<br>  Aim'd at his Crest pass singing by his Ear.<br>  Then did his Dart against the <i> Briton</i>  fly,<br>  And wounded thro' the Plate his brawny Thigh.<br>  A bloody Stream gush'd from the painful wound,<br>  And flowing down his Armour stain'd the ground.<br>  On did th' insulting <i> Frank</i>  with fury fly,<br>  And eager to compleat the Victory.<br>  On high his dreadful Battel-Axe did heave,<br>  Hoping in two the <i> Briton</i> 's head to cleave.<br>  But as it fell, the Courser rose, and took<br>  Between his Ears the Champions furious stroke.<br>  The Steel sunk thro' his Brain the staggering Beast<br>  Fell, and his weight the wounded Rider prest.<br>  Bold <i> Malgo</i>  brought his Squadron up, and freed<br>  The groaning <i> Briton</i>  from the unweildy steed.<br>  They drew by force the Hero from the Field,<br>  Then bore him off laid on a spacious Shield.<br>  So when a Flag Ship is by Foes o'erborn,<br>  Unmasted, and with Cannon's Thunder torn,<br>  From the hot Fight attending Frigates pull<br>  And Tow along the maim'd, disabled Hull.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time the <i> Briton</i>  with his reeking Blade<br>  Had his swift passage to the Quarter made,<br>  Where <i> Arbel</i> 's Sword destroy'd, and strew'd around<br>  With Riders and their Steeds th' encumber'd ground<br>  As when a Lyon from a Mountain's side<br>  Has in the Vale a lowing Herd descry'd,<br>  He stands, and turns his furious Eyes about,<br>  The strongest, sowrest Bull to single out,<br>  One worthy of his Rage, by all the Herd<br>  Obey'd as Lord, and by each Rival fear'd:<br>  Then having fixt his choice aloud he roars,<br>  Proclaims the War, and to the Combate scowrs.<br>  So <i> Arthur</i>  keeping <i> Arbel</i>  in his Eye,<br>  Did to the sight with dreadful fury fly.<br>  The <i> Gaul</i>  observ'd the Monarch from afar,<br>  And for the Combate did himself prepare.<br>  High on his Steed the might Warriour sate,<br>  Proud of his Strength, and fearless of his Fate.<br>  Like a great Pine o'ershadowing all the Wood,<br>  Or ancient Poplar reering by the Flood<br>  His lofty head, the towring <i> Pagan</i>  stood.<br>  Well-pleas'd to undertake the noble Fight<br>  He did aloud to Arms the King invite.<br>  Who on his fiery Steed advancing near,<br>  Projected thro' the Air his pondrous Spear.<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  to make his weapon's message vain<br>  Stoop'd down, and lay upon his Courser's Main.<br>  Th' eluded Weapon o'er his Shoulder flew,<br>  And at great distance <i> Caumont</i> 's Courser slew.<br>  Then did the <i> Frank</i>  employing all his Strength<br>  Discharge his Spear of formidable Length,<br>  Hissing along the Air, the Weapon went,<br>  But in the Hero's Shield its fury spent.<br>  His second Spear the Pious <i> Briton</i>  threw<br>  Which like a flash of Lightning swiftly flew.<br>  The wheeling <i> Frank</i>  could not the Steel evade<br>  Which thro' his Shield and Thigh its passage made;<br>  Whence deep it sunk within the Courser's Chest,<br>  And fixt the Rider to the wounded Beast.<br>  From both their sever'd veins the reeking Blood<br>  Gush'd out, and mingled in one Common Flood.<br>  Then down they fell and prest the slipp'ry plain,<br>  The Rider wounded, and the Courser slain.<br>  The King with martial Ardor to the ground<br>  Leap'd from his Steed to give the fatal wound.<br>  His dreadful Fauchion glittering in his hand<br>  He o'er the vanquish'd <i> Frank</i>  did threatning stand.<br>  The <i> Frank</i>  in Anguish, Horrour, and Despair,<br>  Did on the high rais'd Weapon wildly stare.<br>  Then thus the Pious Prince bespoke the <i> Gaul,</i> <br>  Think on thy Barb'rous Deeds, remember all<br>  The Fatherless and Widdows thou hast made,<br>  And Christian Martyrs to the Flames convey'd.<br>  What numbers has thy single hand destroy'd?<br>  What numbers more the Troops by thee Employ'd?<br>  These Impious Deeds thou bloody Instrument<br>  Of <i> Clotar</i> 's Cruelty at last Repent.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i> Frank</i>  reply'd. No Sorrow can I own<br>  For my just anger to the Christians shown.<br>  Can he impiety to me object,<br>  Who do's the Worship of the Gods neglect?<br>  Whose sacrilegious hands their Temples raze<br>  Destroy their Altars, and their Shrines deface?<br>  Who do's the Gods, and Goddesses dethrone,<br>  Denying all th' Immortal Powers, but one.<br>  I grant I still pursu'd the Christian Sect,<br>  And from just Heav'n I my Reward expect,<br>  For sure th' Impartial Gods will ne'er condemn<br>  A Zeal that springs from Reverence to them.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said.

rose from his high Chair of State:<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  return'd his Answer to relate.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time <i> Palmida</i>  labour'd to engage<br>  Fit Instruments to execute his Rage.<br>  Nor was it long before the Men were found,<br>  For <i> Clotar</i> 's Guards with Murd'rers did abound.<br>  Men who his Barb'rous Orders understood,<br>  Stedfast in Guilt, and long inur'd to Blood:<br>  Men who distinguish'd Cruelty had shown,<br>  Men with Inhumane Tasks Familiar grown;<br>  Ready to act the most Unnatural Deed,<br>  From all Remorse, and all Reluctance freed.<br>  Yet these th' Infernal Enterprise declin'd,<br>  Until their Order was by <i> Clotar</i>  sign'd.<br>  <i> Palmida</i>  left the Ruffians to project,<br>  And fix the Means, their Purpose to effect.<br>  These various Ways and Methods did debate,<br>  How <i> Arthur</i>  to Assault to Save their State.<br>  Some Poison, some the Ponyard did suggest,<br>  As what would gain their Bloody Purpose best.<br>  Some warmly pleaded for an Ambuscade,<br>  Whence issuing out they might the King invade.<br>  Some gave Advice, that with a vast Reward,<br>  They should attempt to gain King <i> Arthur</i> 's Guard.<br>  Others of different Judgments did contend<br>  That all, themselves Deserters should pretend,<br>  That in the Camp they might a Season watch<br>  In which the bloody Task they might dispatch.<br>  These Ways rejected, 'twas at last agreed,<br>  They would accomplish their Atrocious Deed,<br>  When both the Monarchs from their Camps should go<br>  To Ratify the Peace with Solemn Vow.<br>  Then some as Heralds drest, and some as Priests,<br>  Should wait on <i> Clotar</i>  to the Publick Lists;<br>  And all short Swords and Ponyards should prepare,<br>   And hide beneath their Robes the Barb'rous War.<br>  And while King <i> Arthur</i>  did his God invoke<br>  To bind the Treaty, they should strike the Stroke.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i> Franks</i>  mean time who did the Peace promote,<br>  Had their Transaction to an Issue brought.<br>  All things the <i> Briton</i>  ask'd the <i> Franks</i>  agreed<br>  That from his Arms <i> Lutetia</i>  might be freed.<br>  The Term which <i> Clotar</i> 's Orators desir'd<br>  For Arms to be suspended was expir'd,<br>  When a fixt Day the Monarchs did propose,<br>  Wherein with sacred Rites, and Solemn Vows<br>  They would themselves to strict observance bind<br>  Of all things promis'd in the Treaty sign'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the Night approach'd which did precede<br>  The Day appointed for the bloody Deed.<br>  When <i> Derodan</i>  who by his King's Command,<br>  Before the Battel with a chosen Band<br>  T' attack a <i> British</i>  Convoy was detach'd,<br>  His Expedition with Success dispatch'd;<br>  Return'd, and with his Men rejoyn'd the Host,<br>  Griev'd, and enrag'd to find the Battel lost.<br>  He for his Stature, and his Strength was known,<br>  And for his Courage oft in Combate shown.<br>  None for the <i> Gallic</i>  Int'rest did reveal<br>  Or for the <i> Pagan</i>  Altars warmer Zeal.<br>  <i> Palmida</i>  to the Valiant Man addrest,<br>  And with the Language of a Crafty Priest,<br>  His Rage against King <i> Arthur</i>  did Excite,<br>  And show'd it vain to meet his Arms in Fight.<br>  Then by degrees <i> Palmida</i>  did relate<br>  How to compose the War, and save the State,<br>  A brave Design was by a Party laid<br>  With secret Arms King <i> Arthur</i>  to invade.<br>  The Reverend <i> Ruffian</i>  then the Soldier prest<br>  T'embark in this Design and lead the rest;<br>  And promis'd for Reward he should not miss<br>  Promotion here, hereafter Endless Bliss.<br>  The generous Captain tho' amaz'd to hear<br>  Such words from one of Holy Character,<br>  Yet seemingly consented, and supprest<br>  The generous Indignation in his Breast.<br>  The Priest retir'd, and valiant <i> Derodan</i>  <br>  With horror seiz'd, thus to himself began.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what dire Crimes will Sacerdotal Rage,<br>  And eager Bigotry Mankind engage?<br>  Shall I this desperate, black Design pursue,<br>  And in a Monarch's Blood these hands embrue?<br>  Hands that did ne'er Clandestine weapons Sway<br>  Ne'er slew a Foe, but in a generous way:<br>  That none but in the Field have e'er destroy'd,<br>  Shall they in Murthering Princes be employ'd?<br>  If so, what Vengeful Plagues must I expect?<br>  Against this Head what Bolts will Heav'n direct?<br>  To various Gods I offer up my Vows,<br>  But Murther none of all those Gods allows.<br>  Let Pontificial Biggots still contend<br>  That we our State, and Altars to defend,<br>  May any way, and any Weapon chuse,<br>  May hallow'd Poyson, or Stilletto's use.<br>  That we the Christians progress to arrest<br>  May leave the Ponyard in their Monarchs Breast.<br>  Such Priests, and such dire Maxims I abhor<br>  Nor would the Gods pleas'd with such Deeds adore.<br>  Th' Immortal Powers I always understood<br>  Were Merciful, Beneficent, and Good;<br>  Swift to relieve our wants, to punish slow,<br>  Who perfect Justice in their Empire show.<br>  Such Cruelty, and Treacherous Violence<br>  Those pure and Righteous Beings must incense.<br>  I'll for our Altars, and my Country weild<br>  All honourable Arms in open Field.<br>  To save this Realm undaunted I'll oppose<br>  The greatest Dangers, and the Fiercest Foes:<br>  But I detest this Ignominious Deed<br>  No Prince by me Perfidiously shall bleed.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Uriel</i>  Heav'ns high Order to obey,<br>  Did his Immortal Wings on high display,<br>  And from th' Empyreal Turrets down the Sky<br>  To valiant <i> Derodan</i>  did swiftly fly.<br>  The Radiant Envoy quickly did prepare<br>  A youthful Shape, mild Eyes and Cheeks of Air.<br>  Then did he Silence break, and thus began,<br>  You bravely have exprest, undaunted Man,<br>  Your just Abhorrence of the black Design<br>  In which a Band of barb'rous <i> Franks</i>  combine.<br>   But from the Heav'nly Regions I descend<br>  To let you know that here you must not end.<br>  You must the dire Confed'racy disclose<br>  To save the Monarch from Clandestine Foes.<br>  If <i> Arthur</i> 's blood is by the <i> Ruffians</i>  spilt<br>  By not preventing it, you share the Guilt.<br>  Heav'n has by valiant <i> Derodan</i>  decreed,<br>  To disappoint the black, Inhumane Deed.<br>  Go then and let that Prince his Danger know,<br>  Let him his Safety to thy Vertue owe.<br>  That said, the <i> Cherub</i>  from the place withdrew,<br>  And to the Seats of Peace and Pleasure flew.<br>  The Starry Stranger gone, the <i> Frank</i>  revolv'd<br>  The Message in his Mind and soon resolv'd<br>  To pay obedience; then with eager Zeal<br>  He went th' Important Secret to reveal.<br>  Conducted by the Stars uncertain Light<br>  He at the <i> Briton</i> 's Camp arriv'd by Night.<br>  The watchful Out-guards who oppos'd his way<br>  To the great <i> Arthur</i>  did the <i> Frank</i>  convey.<br>  Admitted to his Presence <i> Derodan,<br>  First</i>  low Obeisance made, and then began.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hither I come great Monarch to detect<br>  A black Design that do's your Life respect.<br>  A bloody Band with Hellish fury fir'd,<br>  Against your Royal Person have conspir'd.<br>  I <i> Gallia</i> 's Gods and Goddesses adore,<br>  And with th' advancement of <i> Lutetia</i> 's power:<br>  But can't believe that for Religion's sake,<br>  I with the Ponyard may a Prince attack.<br>  Th' Immortal Powers to serve Religion's Cause<br>  Ne'er gave Command to break thro' Nature's Laws.<br>  Perfidious Outrage, Murther, Violence,<br>  Tho' us'd to serve the Gods, the Gods incense.<br>  When therefore by <i> Palmida</i>  prest to joyn<br>  With bloody Men engag'd in this Design,<br>  My Soul the barb'rous motion did detest,<br>  And various Passions strove within my Breast.<br>  While with my thoughts Opprest, a glorious God<br>  Descended to me from his high abode.<br>  He seem'd <i> Apollo</i>  by his Beamy Face,<br>  His blooming Beauty, and his Youthful Grace.<br>  Then did the bright Divinity direct,<br>  That hasting to your Camp I should detect<br>  The horrid Plot against your Life design'd,<br>  And now I must perform the task enjoyn'd.<br>  Then did the valiant <i> Frank</i>  the King instruct<br>  Who were the Chiefs, that did th' Affair conduct.<br>  And where, and how, and when they had agreed<br>  To wreek their Malice by th' inhumane Deed.<br>  Then said, do you, great Prince, due Caution take,<br>  And for their hidden Arms enquiry make.<br>  I, that my Message may Belief obtain,<br>  Will under Guard within your Camp remain;<br>  That if my Words are false your Vengeful hand<br>  May Death inflict, such as my Crimes demand. <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pious <i> Arthur</i>  prais'd the generous Zeal<br>  Which mov'd the <i> Frank</i>  this Treach'ry to reveal.<br>  And gave Command he should Rewards receive<br>  Such as great Kings do to great Merit give;<br>  If the Succeeding Morn should clearly shew<br>  The Plot discover'd by the <i> Frank,</i>  was true.<br>  Now had the Sun disclos'd the Mountains heads,<br>  And pour'd warm glory on the reeking Meads.<br>  <i> Clotar</i>  arose, and soon with Eager speed<br>  Came mounted on his <i> Mauritanian</i>  Steed,<br>  Attended with th' Assassins some as Priests,<br>  Some habited as <i> Heralds</i>  to the Lists.<br>  Ensigns of Peace and Piety they bore,<br>  But treach'rous Arms beneath their Vestments wore.<br>  The Armys on the Plain drawn in Array<br>  On either Side did at a distance stay.<br>  Except the Troops who with their Shields reclin'd<br>  And Spears erect the <i> Palisado</i> 's lin'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next <i> Albion</i> 's King advanc'd with God-like Grace<br>  Born on a Courser of <i> Eborac</i>  Race.<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  with Wonder and with Fear behold<br>  His Martial Port, and Arms adorn'd with Gold.<br>  All by their Looks their inward Joy declare<br>  That now he came for Peace, and not for War.<br>  The Terror of <i> Lutetia</i>  brightly shone<br>  In Armour clad, so well in Battel known.<br>  Advancing near to <i> Clotar</i>  thus he cry'd,<br>  Have I in vain on <i> Clotar</i> 's Vows rely'd?<br>  'Tis hard, to think a Monarch should agree<br>  T' Assault my Life by Barb'rous Treachery.<br>  That with Assassins <i> Clotar</i>  should combine,<br>  Approve, Abet, and Aid their black Design.<br>  This on a Prince so great a Stain would prove,<br>  As Rivers cannot cleanse, or Time remove.<br>  Yet, valiant <i> Franks,</i>  and faithful <i> Britons</i> , know<br>  That one who seems a brave and generous Foe,<br>  Has unconstrain'd, unsought, unask'd, declar'd<br>  That <i> Clotar</i>  has Perfidious Arms prepar'd.<br>  That these who Heralds and as Priests appear,<br>  Beneath their Robes short Swords and Ponyards wear.<br>  That these are Veteran Ruffians in disguise,<br>  Intending to Assault me by Surprise<br>  When I dismount, and to the Altar go,<br>  To Ratify the Peace by solemn Vow.<br>  I doubtful, neither wholly disbelieve<br>  The Charge, nor to it wholly Credit give.<br>  But if unjust these Accusations are,<br>  Then let the Search their Innocence declare.<br>  But if their Guilt will not the Search abide,<br>  The Charge is then too plain to be deny'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said. King <i> Clotar</i>  all enrag'd to find,<br>  That <i> Arthur</i>  knew the Treachery design'd,<br>  Exclaiming loud, to <i> Franks</i>  and <i> Britons</i>  cry'd,<br>  To break the Treaty what mean Arts are try'd? <br>  What wild Suggestions, what vile Shifts are these,<br>  Which <i> Arthur</i>  uses to retard the Peace?<br>  And do's the <i> Briton</i>  thus his Faith betray,<br>  Yet by malicious Accusations lay<br>  On us the Guilt, 'tis plain his hostile Mind<br>  Is not to Peace, but to the Sword inclin'd.<br>  Since <i> Arthur</i>  still on Blood and Slaughter bent,<br>  Eludes

to fall<br>  Embalm'd before-hand for his Funeral.<br>  When <i> Cutar</i>  saw him on the Works appear,<br>  With great Disdain he threw his massy Spear.<br>  Which thro' his Coat of Mail and Crimson

for another Sword aloud he cry'd,<br>  The <i> Briton</i> 's Fauchion did his Throat divide.<br>  The gasping Wound pour'd forth a Crimson flood,<br>  Down fell the Warriour Strangled in his

And raging did his Arms demand,<br>  Then brandishing his Fauchion in his hand,<br>  Onward the Monarch went to Head the <i> Gauls</i> ,<br>  And led his Cohorts to defend the Walls.<br>  Hopeless become he, therefore fearless grew,<br>  And from Despair immoderate Courage drew.<br>  He rav'd aloud, and boldly did invite<br>  The <i> British</i>  Monarch to renew the Fight.<br>  So when a

himself receives a fatal Wound,<br>  And weltring in his Blood distains the Ground.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time, the Valiant <i> Britons</i>  did prepare<br>  Their Arms, and all their Instruments of War;<br>  Resolv'd by Storm <i> Lutetia</i> 's Walls to gain,<br>  And with this Triumph end the great Campaign.<br>  Before the furious Onset did Commence,<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  prepar'd to make a brave Defence.<br>  Thick on the Walls the <i> Gallic</i>  Youth appear'd,<br>  And War-like noise thro' every Street was heard. <br>  Some brought long Spears, vast Bars of Iron some,<br>  Part arm'd with Darts, and part with Arrows come.<br>  Some raging ran with huge <i> Herculean</i>  Clubs,<br>  Some massy Balls of Brass, some mighty Tubs<br>  Of Cynders, some great Pots of Sulphur bore,<br>  And some the Stones up from the Pavement tore.<br>  What Instruments of Death came next to hand,<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  caught up, the <i> Britons</i>  to withstand.<br>  So when the Foe invades the Fragrant Cells<br>  In which the Bees industrious Nation dwells;<br>  The watchful Centinels the Signal give,<br>  To raise the whole Militia of the Hive.<br>  Strait mighty Uproar, Tumult, War-like sound<br>  Thro' all the Waxy Labyrinth rebound.<br>  From their high Seats the noisy Youth descend<br>  In raging Troops, their Fortress to defend.<br>  The trembling Roof resounds with threatning Swarms,<br>  With Captains Fury, and the Din of Arms.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Pious <i> Arthur</i>  three Detachments made,<br>  And gave Command <i> Lutetia</i>  to invade<br>  In three distinct Attacks; the Chiefs he nam'd<br>  To lead the Troops, were all for Courage fam'd.<br>  <i> Cutar,</i>  to whom pale Fear was yet unknown,<br>  With Death and Danger long familiar grown,<br>  Was nam'd to lead the First, the Second Band<br>  <i> Talmar,</i>  the Third brave <i> Maca</i>  did Command.<br>  Boldly the <i> Britons</i>  march'd to Storm the Walls,<br>  And from their lofty Towers to chase the <i> Gauls</i> .<br>  The Archers on the Foe their Arrows spent,<br>  And their long Spears the raging Spearmen sent.<br>  Some flaming Firebrands at the Turrets threw,<br>  Here Oaken Trunchions, here bright Javelins flew.<br>  Here glitt'ring Darts a bearded Tempest sung,<br>  Here showers of Stones by skilful Hands were slung.<br>  Part hurl'd up masly Balls of Iron, part<br>  Threw Wild-fire temper'd with destructive Art;<br>  Artillery more dreadful than the Sword,<br>  Which <i> Sodom</i> 's Lake, and <i> &AElig;tna</i> 's Caves afford<br>  With Sulphur, Nitre, and Bitumen stor'd.<br>  The Storm was dreadful, while prodigious Cries,<br>  And War-like noise rang thro' th' astonish'd Skies.<br>  Many brave <i> Britons</i>  on the place expir'd,<br>  And many Wounded from the Town retir'd.<br>  Thus long th' undaunted <i> Britons</i>  from beneath,<br>  With missive Ruin, and projected Death,<br>  Gaul'd the <i> Lutetians,</i>  but in vain they strove,<br>  From their strong Walls their Squadrons to remove.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then <i> Cutar</i>  hot with Martial Fury, cry'd,<br>  Enough, brave Friends of this; and then apply'd<br>  His Scaling Ladder to the Walls, the rest<br>  Provok'd by his Example, onward prest.<br>  To guard their Heads against the impending War,<br>  They joyn'd their Shields, and held them in the Air,<br>  Which with Contiguous Brims a Covering made;<br>  And thus advanc'd <i> Lutetia</i>  to invade.<br>  <i> Cutar</i>  with noble Ardor in his Eyes,<br>  Clad in Refulgent Arms began to rise.<br>  Profuse of Life he mounted from beneath,<br>  With Danger pleas'd, and negligent of Death:<br>  Of Death which thick descended from the Wall<br>  In all its Shapes, and horrible in all.<br>  Spears, Arrows, Darts stuck in his batter'd Shield,<br>  Thick as the Canes which crown an <i> Indian</i>  Field.<br>  A thousand Deaths he on his Shield sustain'd,<br>  And the high Battlements had almost gain'd:<br>  At last the Warriour by a Javelin struck,<br>  Which past his Shield, and in his in-step stuck,<br>  He was oblig'd to quit the hot Attack,<br>  And by his Spear supported, halted back.<br>  <i> Hobbesian</i>  (who with Honour do's not name<br>  <i> Hobbesian?</i>  his has rais'd <i> Britannia</i> 's Fame)<br>  Apply'd his Balm with wondrous Art prepar'd,<br>  The Hero heal'd, and had a great Reward.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' from the Walls the Chief was forc'd to halt,<br>  His Troops by <i> Vebba</i>  led, renew'd th' Assault.<br>  Beneath the brazen Canopy's high Roof,<br>  Made by their Shields to beat the Tempest off,<br>  They rais'd their Scaling Ladders to the Top<br>  Of the high Battlements, and mounted up.<br>  But still the <i> Gallic</i>  Troops maintain'd their Post,<br>  And many Valiant Chiefs the <i> Britons</i>  lost.<br>  Many were crush'd to pieces by the fall<br>  Of Trees, and Rocks hurl'd from <i> Lutetia</i> 's Wall.<br>  Some fell in Storms of Arrows, some in Showers<br>  Of Darts projected from the lofty Towers.<br>  Some were by massy Clubs of Life berest,<br>  Some had their Heads by Battle-Axes cleft.<br>  Part had their Brains dash'd out by Iron-Balls,<br>  Which flying round bespatter'd all the Walls.<br>  Some were with flaming Pitch or Sulphur burn'd,<br>  Some from th' inclining Ladder headlong turn'd.<br>  Some having gain'd the Battlement's high tops;<br>  And leaping boldly midst the <i> Gallic</i>  Troops,<br>  Before their Shields were rais'd to ward the thrust,<br>  Pierc'd with the Spear, fell Breathless to the Dust.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time in Arms great <i> Talmar</i>  glorious Shone,<br>  And with a noble fire assail'd the Town.<br>  Illustrious <i> Ansel</i>  did the Troops Command<br>  Which <i> Talmar</i> 's valiant Squadron did withstand.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  did his usual Ardor show,<br>  And with amazing Courage Charg'd the Foe.<br>  He show'd a Mind for great Atchievements form'd,<br>  And midst a thousand Deaths, <i> Lutetia</i>  storm'd.<br>  Now he retreated, now he onward flew,<br>  Tho' still repuls'd, did still th' Assault renew.<br>  When he at last receiv'd a fatal Blow,<br>  From a vast Stone which once th' impending Brow<br>  Of some high Rock, fell down with weather worn,<br>  Or from it's Airy Seat with Thunder torn.<br>  Great <i> Astroban</i>  with both his hands did throw<br>  The craggy heap to crush th' adventrous Foe.<br>  It did his nerves above the Knee-pan wound,<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  fell, and strecht along the ground,<br>  His Friends came round, and to the Army's Rear<br>  Did from the Walls with grief the Hero bear.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time, a Third Assault was carry'd on<br>  By <i> Maca,</i>  who Immortal Praises won.<br>  Twice his Brigade with Vigour did Attack,<br>  The lofty Walls, and twice was beaten back.<br>  <i> Maca</i>  enrag'd did the third time renew<br>  The fierce Assault, and with his Ladder flew<br>  To Scale the Town, boldly the Warriour rose,<br>  And leap'd upon the Walls amidst the Foes.<br>  He beat the Squadrons off, and leaping down<br>  Maintain'd a noble Fight within the Town.<br>  His Friends with wondrous Brav'ry strove to gain<br>  The high rais'd Battlements, but strove in vain.<br>  After a sharp Assault, the Walls at last<br>  <i> Lanar</i>  to follow <i> Maca,</i>  only past.<br>  So when the Sea urg'd by a furious Gale,<br>  Musters his watry Squadrons to assail<br>  A lofty Mound, that do's some Port defend,<br>  In fruitless Insults they their Fury spend:<br>  Yet some tall Waves that to the Storm advance<br>  O'erlooking all the Ocean, may by chance<br>  O'er the high Fence their liquid Mountain throw,<br>  While all the rest defeated backward flow.<br>  Soon, as great <i> Maca</i>  saw his valiant Friend,<br>  Let us, he cry'd, bravely our selves defend.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  may a prosperous Onset make,<br>  Bring us Relief, and Strong <i> Lutetia</i>  take.<br>  Let us howe'er the <i> Gallic</i>  Troops defy,<br>  Combate like <i> Britons,</i>  and like <i> Britons</i>  dy.<br>  Let us such firm, unshaken Courage show,<br>  As may at least intimidate the Foe:<br>  Who when they see what Men the Town assail,<br>  Will feel their Spirits sink, their Courage fail.<br>  Thus by a great and honourable Fall<br>  We shall dismay and help subdue the <i> Gaul</i> ,<br>  And leave him heartless to defend the Wall.<br>  Bravely the Chiefs th' invading Foe sustain'd,<br>  And prest with whole Brigades, the Fight maintain'd.<br>  Great numbers they destroy'd, and spread around<br>  With sever'd Limbs, and gasping Heads the ground.<br>  Long Back to Back th' unbroken Warriours stood,<br>  Panting with Slaughter, red with hostile Blood.<br>  Those of the <i> Franks</i>  who hardier than the rest,<br>  Close on the mighty Champions onward prest,<br>  Did sure Destruction from the Fauchion meet,<br>  And fell in heaps before the Conquerours feet.<br>  Henceforth from every Side the Clamorous Foe,<br>  Against the Chiefs, promiscous Weapons throw.<br>  Spears, Javelins, Arrows, Darts across the Sky<br>  In storms of bright Destruction round them fly.<br>  A brave Defence they made, and each great Chief<br>  Show'd Strength, and Courage which exceed Belief.<br>  Their ample Orbs sustain'd a pondrous Wood<br>  Of thick set Spears, that high and horrid stood.<br>  Their Arms were blunted, and their Armour bruis'd,<br>  And gaping Wounds their Blood around diffus'd.<br>  Till faint with bloody Labour, Wounds and Pain<br>  <i> Lanar</i>  fell down and lay strecht out as slain.<br>  <i> Maca</i>  turn'd round, and o'er his Body stood<br>  Bath' d in his Own, his Friends, and <i> Gallic</i>  Blood.<br>  With wondrous Constancy th' Intrepid Man<br>  Beat off the thronging Troops, which on him ran.<br>  Till <i> Clotar</i>  hearing that the Walls were Scal'd,<br>  Came to repel the <i> Britons,</i>  and assail'd<br>  With utmost Rage the <i> Caledonian</i>  Chief,<br>  Who bravely still maintain'd the War-like Strife.<br>  At last, exhausted with expence of Blood,<br>  Which from his gaping Wounds in Rivers flow'd,<br>  He fell, and o'er his Friend expiring lay,<br>  And gasp'd without a groan, his Life away.<br>  So when strong Shipwrights fell a lofty Pine,<br>  Which they a Mast for some tall Ship design,<br>  With thick repeated Strokes, and frequent Wounds<br>  The Mountain trembles, and the Wood resounds:<br>  As yet th' unshaken Tree amidst the Skies,<br>  Scarce nods his head, and the sharp Axe defies:<br>  At last, his roots cut off, at every stroke,<br>  He learns from side to side to roll and rock;<br>  As he his fitness for the Work would shew,<br>  Which when a Mast he must hereafter do.<br>  Then on a suddain, with a mighty sound<br>  He leaves the Heav'ns, and loads the groaning Ground.<br>  <i> Clotar</i>  rush'd in, and with the Fauchion's stroke,<br>  Each Champion's Head from off his Shoulder took.<br>  Which high amidst the Air on lofty Poles,<br>  To daunt their Friends he planted on the Walls.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  by the miserable Sight<br>  Were not dismay'd; but more provok'd to Fight.<br>  The Pious King by the sad Object mov'd,<br>  For he the Warriors much esteem'd and lov'd;<br>  Grasping a flaming Fir-Tree in his hand,<br>  Flew to the <i> Eastern</i>  Gate, and gave Command,<br>  That his undaunted Troops should do the same,<br>  And burn the Gate down with devouring Flame.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth their Valiant Prince obey'd,<br>  And Trees and Timber to the Gate convey'd,<br>  Where soon they rais'd a thick and lofty Wood,<br>  Which, as thy Funeral Pile, <i> Lutetia,</i>  stood.<br>  Quickly the lighted Trees began to Choak<br>  The Heav'ns around with tow'ring Flame, and Smoke.<br>  Fast to the Gate th' incumbent Plague adher'd,<br>  Which soon but one vast glowing Cole appear'd.<br>  The ruddy Conq'rour with refulgent Arms<br>  Climbs up the Towers, and all the Town alarms.<br>  From the high Gate the melted Iron flow'd,<br>  And on the ground a pond'rous Deluge glow'd.<br>  The fierce Invader fasten'd on the Walls,<br>  And from the cleaving Stones broke mighty Scales;<br>  With ravening Teeth it tore vast pieces out,<br>  And raging, threw the Fragments round about.<br>  The Fire with such Success the Gate assail'd,<br>  O'er Oaks, and Stones, and Bars of Brass prevail'd.<br>  Some <i> Franks,</i>  dismay'd to see the Burning spread,<br>  Left the high Walls, and from its Terrour fled.<br>  Some to the ground from the high Turrets came,<br>  Smother'd with pitchy Smoke, and fry'd with Flame.<br>  Some, who to quench the Burning, forward rush'd,<br>  Were by the falling Heaps in pieces crush'd.<br>  For the high Towers, the Gate, and shatter'd Wall,<br>  In mingled Ruin now began to fall.<br>  The cracking Structure, crackling Flames, and Cries<br>  Dreadful to hear, distracted all the Skies.<br>  Thus did the lofty Gate the Flames obey,<br>  And on the ground in smoking Rubish lay.<br>  The Streets were open to the <i> Briton</i> 's view,<br>  To guard the Breach The <i> Gallic</i>  Squadrons flew.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Pious <i> Arthur</i>  Waving o'er his Head<br>  High in the Air, broad <i> Caliburno,</i>  said<br>  Come, follow, <i> Britons,</i>  where I lead the way,<br>  These Walls no longer can your progress stay.<br>  Then with an ardor wholly <i> Arthur</i> 's own,<br>  Such as before was ne'er in Battel shown,<br>  Up the high Breach the fearless Monarch rose,<br>  Resolv'd to cut his passage thro' his Foes:<br>  To whom his glorious Arms more dreadful shone,<br>  Then all the impetuous Flames before had done.<br>  He did with Ease o'er the high Ruins leap,<br>  And strode with mighty strides from Heap to Heap.<br>  The <i> Briton</i>  thus advanc'd; on the other hand<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  drew up his fury to withstand.<br>  <i> Marac</i>  did first the <i> Briton</i> 's course resist,<br>  Threw his bright Javelin, but the Warriour mist.<br>  Then his vast Spear the mighty Monarch cast,<br>  Which all the folds of the thick Buckler past.<br>  Thence thro' his Skull it passage did obtain,<br>  And pierc'd the inmost Marrow of the Brain;<br>  Where the melodious Strings of Sense are found<br>  Up to a due and just extension wound;<br>  All tun'd for Life, and fitted to receive<br>  Th' harmonious strokes which outward Objects give.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great <i> Stuffa</i>  next oppos'd the King who came,<br>  From <i> Alpine</i>  Mountains to advance his Fame.<br>  The mighty <i> Allobrog</i>  all swoln with rage,<br>  Shook his long Ash preparing to engage.<br>  A Breast, and Back, and Boots of Brass he wore,<br>  Dreadful for Arms, but for his Aspect more.<br>  High in the Air his polish'd Shield did glow,<br>  As when a Wood burns on a Mountains brow.<br>  <i> Colossus</i>  like he on the Ruins stood<br>  Verst in Destruction, and inur'd to Blood.<br>  The haughty Chief resolv'd to guard the Breach,<br>  And as the King advanc'd within the reach<br>  Of his long Spear, the vast <i> Helvetian</i>  threw,<br>  Hoping to pierce th' invading <i> Briton</i>  thro';<br>  But o'er his Head the pond'rous Weapon flew.<br>  Then at the hideous <i> Allobrog,</i>  the King<br>  Did with his usual Force and Fury fling<br>  His Glitt'ring Javelin, whose impetuous Stroke<br>  The Warriour's Shin-bone all in Splinters broke.<br>  The <i> Pagan</i>  fell, and did in Torment roar,<br>  Curst all his Gods, but Curst King <i> Arthur</i>  more.<br>  He on the Breach did his vast Limbs extend,<br>  And with his Bulk did still the Town defend.<br>  <i> Arthur</i>  came up, and with a single Blow<br>  Struck off his Head, and then amidst the Foe<br>  The ghastly heap with Indignation threw,<br>  Which gnash'd its Teeth, and Curs'd ev'n as it flew.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as th'  Helvetian Champion fell, the rest<br>  Forsook the Breach with pannic Fear possest.<br>  The Conquering <i> Briton</i>  march'd undaunted down,<br>  And wav'd his flaming Sword within the Town.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth the King's Command obey'd,<br>  Onward they came <i> Lutetia</i>  to invade,<br>  And o'er the Breach their Ensigns they convey'd.<br>  Here did the <i> Franks</i>  a stout Resistance make,<br>  And boldly Charg'd the Foe, to beat them back.<br>  Long did their Troops a bloody Fight maintain,<br>  And many Chiefs were wounded, many slain.<br>  While on the Foe the Pious <i> Briton</i>  prest,<br>  He struck his Javelin thro' <i> Palmida</i> 's Breast.<br>  Next at his feet lay great <i> Olcarden</i>  slain,<br>  Thro' his right Eye the Weapon pierc'd his Brain.<br>  Then <i> Gyon,</i>  <i> Bomont</i> , and brave <i> Harlam</i>  dy'd<br>  By <i> Arthur</i> 's Arms, and many Chiefs beside.<br>  Broad <i> Caliburno</i>  mighty Slaughter made,<br>  And high in heaps the <i> Gallic</i>  Cohorts laid.<br>  Limbs, sever'd Heads, dismember'd Trunks around<br>  With Helms and Bucklers mixt, o'erspread the ground.<br>  As when a loud Autumnal Tempest moves<br>  Th' inclining Pines, and shakes the Golden Groves,<br>  The Leaves and Fruit from bending boughs fall down<br>  In yellow Showers, and all the mountains Crown.<br>  So thick a long the Streets the <i> Pagans</i>  lay,<br>  Where the destroying <i> Briton</i>  made his way.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean time King <i> Clotar</i>  his Battalions brought,<br>  From distant Parts where he before had fought.<br>  Urg'd with resistless Fate, and wild with Rage,<br>  He wav'd his Fauchion eager to engage.<br>  King <i> Arthur</i>  seeing <i> Clotar</i>  from afar,<br>  Advanc'd with martial Joy to meet the War.<br>  The <i> Franks</i>  and <i> Britons</i>  did their Ranks divide,<br>  And show'd a vast Concern on either side.<br>  As when two Lyons eager to possess<br>  The howling Empire of the Wilderness<br>  Rush to decisive War on <i> Lybia</i> 's Plains,<br>  They lash their Sides, and shake their Tawny Mains.<br>  Then grin, and roar, and from their raging Eyes<br>  Send out fierce streams of Fire amidst the Skys.<br>  Death and Defyance in their looks appear,<br>  And all the Forest seems to shake with Fear.<br>  With no less deadly Looks, with such a Rage<br>  The mighty Foes for Conquest did engage.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i> Gallic</i>  King with Fury onward prest,<br>  And aim'd a mortal stroke at <i> Arthur</i> 's Crest.<br>  His faithful Shield the Fauchion's progress staid,<br>  Which in the Plate a deep Impression made.<br>  The Pious Prince enrag'd, against the Foe<br>  From his strong Arm discharg'd a dreadful Blow.<br>  It beat against his head his spacious Shield,<br>  His Eyes grew dim, and back the Monarch reel'd.<br>  But he recovering soon his Feet and Sight,<br>  Return'd with Fury to renew the Fight.<br>  The War was terrible, and either Foe<br>  Did mighty skill in Arms and Courage show.<br>  <i> Lutetia</i> 's Towers did with the Strokes resound<br>  And the pale Cohorts trembling stood around.<br>  So when two Eagles on the Airy Brow<br>  Of some high Rock, their Strength and Courage show<br>  In single Fight, the Feather'd Foes employ<br>  Beaks, Pounces, Wings each other to destroy. <br>  Woods, Valleys, Mountains, Shores, and ecchoing Rocks<br>  Ring with the War, and feel the furious strokes.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i> Frank</i>  observing that his Arm did weild<br>  His Sword in vain against King <i> Arthur</i> 's Shield.<br>  Retreating, to the ground did downward stoop,<br>  And heav'd a mighty Rocky Fragment up.<br>  Then did the furious Warriour forward step,<br>  And hurl'd with both his hands the pondrous Heap.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  trembled when they saw the Stone<br>  With such a Force against their Monarch thrown.<br>  O'er <i> Arthur</i> 's Shoulder flew the flinting Rock,<br>  But as it past a craggy Corner struck<br>  The Shoulder's point, and his bright Armour bruis'd,<br>  Which in his Flesh a painful Wound produc'd.<br>  His Friends grew pale to see that Shoulder hurt,<br>  Which did their Empire, and their Hopes support.<br>  The Pious Monarch did the Wound neglect,<br>  And for one Mortal Stroke did all his might collect,<br>  Like some Celestial Sword of temper'd Flame,<br>  Down on the <i> Frank</i>  keen <i> Caliburno</i>  came.<br>  It fell upon his Neck with vengeful Sway,<br>  And thro' the shrinking Muscles made its way,<br>  The Head re-clin'd, on the right Shoulder lay.<br>  Down fell the <i> Frank,</i>  disabled by the Wound,<br>  Weltring in Gore, and raging, Bit the Ground.<br>  The Pious Prince did o'er the Warriour stand,<br>  Bright <i> Caliburno</i>  flaming in his hand.<br>  And thus the <i> Frank</i>  bespoke: Ambitious Prince,<br>  Justice Divine do's now Mankind convince,<br>  That Heav'n, tho' patient, do's not still neglect<br>  To crush Oppressors, and th' Opprest protect.<br>  What Seas of Blood hast thou in pastime shed?<br>  What Rapine has thy Lust of Empire fed?<br>  How hast thou Ravag'd, Ruin'd, Spoil'd, Undone<br>  The Realms of Neighbour Princes, and thy own?<br>  Thy Friends thou hast betray'd, surpriz'd thy Foes,<br>  And broke the Sacred Bonds of solemn Vows.<br>  <i> Europa</i> 's wasted Realms proclaim aloud,<br>  Thy Thirst of Empire, and thy Thirst of Blood.<br>  Long have the Nations round addrest the Skies,<br>  For Bolts and Vengeance, with Confederate Cries;<br>  And Heav'n at last with the just Prayer complies.<br>  This said, the Monarch with a second Blow<br>  Struck off his Head, and spurn'd the Vanquish'd Foe.<br>  The <i> Britons</i>  rais'd to Heav'n a joyful Shout,<br>  The <i> Franks,</i>  dismay'd with Ignominious Rout,<br>  Began to fly; the King their Squadrons chas'd,<br>  And o'er their slaughter'd Heaps Victorious pass'd.<br>  So when a Shoal of flying Fish have spy'd,<br>  By the Reflection from his glitt'ring Side,<br>  A swift Finn'd Dolphin stricking thro' the Tyde;<br>  They fly with all the speed that deadly fear<br>  Can give, to scape the glorious Ravager:<br>  The noise of clashing Arms, amazing Cries,<br>  And horrid Clamours, rend th' astonish'd Skies.<br>  Anguish, Despair, Distraction, ghastly Fear,<br>  In all their frightful Forms, and Looks appear.<br>  Thro' every Street ran down a Sea of Blood,<br>  Shields, Heads, and Helms lay mingled in the Flood.<br>  The King prest onward with resistless Force,<br>  Nor dar'd they make a Stand to stay his course.<br>  As when to Plant some Island newly found,<br>  Men Fire the Woods to free th' unwholsome Ground. <br>  The lawless Flames born by Impetuous Winds,<br>  Burn down the ancient Oaks, and lofty Pines.<br>  They clear the Region, and enrich the Soil<br>  With heaps of Ashes, and the Forest's spoil.<br>  So did th' invading Monarch make his way,<br>  So thick the Spoils behind the Conqueror lay.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i> Franks</i>  at last, seeing <i> Lutetia</i>  lost,<br>  That nothing could resist the <i> British</i>  Host,<br>  By prudent <i> Clodion</i> 's Counsel made a stand,<br>  Threw down their Arms, and did their Lives demand.<br>  Then <i> Clodion</i>  thus the <i> British</i>  King bespoke:<br>  We your Compassion, mighty Prince, invoke.<br>  <i> Lutetia</i> 's yours, we your Imperial Sway<br>  Will, as your Subjects, or your Slaves, obey.<br>  Your raging Troops, Victorious King, restrain,<br>  And save the <i> Gallic</i>  Youth who yet remain.<br>  Our Wives, our Maids, our Babes for Pity cry,<br>  Your Justice will not let the Guiltless dy.<br>  From the destroying Sword their Lives secure,<br>  And let your Mercy Triumph o'er your Power.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said. The King did with Compassion melt,<br>  And in his Breast relenting Mercy felt.<br>  Enough of Blood he cry'd, the Sword forbear,<br>  Th' Oppressor's Slain, let us the Subject spare.<br>  The <i> British</i>  Youth the King's Command obey'd,<br>  And Soon the progress of the Sword was stay'd.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus in despight of all th' Efforts that Hell<br>  And Earth could make the <i> Briton</i>  to repell,<br>  With wondrous Toyl, and mighty Fortitude,<br>  The valiant King the haughty <i> Frank</i>  Subdu'd.<br> <br>  <br>  THE INDEX &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
