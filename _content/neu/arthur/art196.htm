No doubt I'll die its debtor.<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --Think on its mercies, O Alphonso.<br>   <i> Alp.</i> --Ay, so I did--I thought upon my death.<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --How could you bear the idea of self-murder!<br>   <i> Alp.</i> --Better than I could bear life's burden.--<br> <i>   Mar.</i> --Than black ingratitude, a deadlier sin<br> Ne'er stained the catalogues of human crime,<br> And yours is worst,--ingratitude to Heaven.<br>   <i> Alp.</i> --Not so,--I wish'd to pay the debt I owe it,<br> The debt of nature--even before 'tis due.<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --This is but mochery; heav'n yokes thee with existence,<br> And darest thou cast it off, and say to heaven<br> I will not bear thy burden?  This is madness!<br> No more--here comes a person to the cave--<br> He seems a laboring peasant by his dress.<br> <br> 		[<i> Enter 1st Spirit.</i> ]<br> <br> Hail, friend, whence came you, and for what intent.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --I chanced to see you enter in this cave,<br> And curiosity hath brought me hither,<br> To know what men you be; can I do aught<br> To give you pleasure,--I am at your service.<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --We are two mariners escaped from shipwreck,<br> And seek a shelter in this silent cave--<br> Can you procure us food.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --	I can and will.--<br> But why art thou, young man, so much cast down.<br> Hast thou lost some dear friend in this sas wreck.--[<i> To A.</i> <br>   <i> Mar.</i> --Ay, he has lost his wealth.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --			Of what description?<br>   <i> Alp.</i> --A wooden casket, interlaid with gold,<br> In which I had deposited some stones,<br> Gems of high value, and som precious pearls.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --I can procure it.<br>   <i> Alp.</i> 			Go, you mock us,<br> 'Tis buried in the bosom of the deep,<br> Beyond all chance and hope of a recovery.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --Stay you but here awhile, and I will bring it;<br> Nay, do not follow me, I must alone.--<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --Come back, Alphonso, better here remain,--<br> This man perhaps can bring the casket to us.<br>   <i> Alp.</i> --Tell me--have you seen it--have some pity,<br> And do not keep me in suspense, I pray you.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --If you will stay I'll bring the casket to you--<br> But if you follow me, I must not get it.--[<i> Exit.</i> <br>   <i> Alp.</i> --Hope shines not here, or if it deigns to shine,<br> 'Tis like the gleamings of a winter's sun,<br> Through leafless trees, upon the frozen ground.<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --I feel a goodly boding; sure this man<br> Will restore your casket to you--I perceived<br> From the expression of his countenance<br> He meant not to amuse him with your sorrow.<br>   <i> Alp.</i> --I have been tutored to adversity:<br> Misfortune still attends me from my cradle,<br> And aught of good seems supernatural;<br> I can't give credence to it.--Mark you this,<br> We shall be disappointed,--I know well.<br> Tut, think you I should meet with such good luck<br> To find the casket, with my buried hopes!<br> Why all the miracles upon record,--<br> The loaves and fishes, healing blind and lame,<br> Could never equal that.<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --	You are too desponding;<br> There still should be a medium, twixt despair<br> And hopes too sanguine:--both alike mislead,<br> Tho' in a different way.  Some men would seem<br> Never to keep the true and mediate path, <br> But wander on this side to seek for flowers<br> Or on that side to stumble in the ditch.<br> If hope seduces, with a harlot's wile--<br> Despair enslaves us, with an iron grasp.<br> Then rouse and shake this bold intruder off,<br> Nor let your manhood be ta'en prisoner<br> By sour-eyed despondency; let sighs and tears<br> Be still the love-sick virgin's last resource,<br> But men should be above such female weakness.<br> <br> 		[<i> Re-enter Spir. with casket.</i> ]<br> <br>   <i> Alp.</i> --[<i> Running to him.</i> ]--It is,--it is my casket,--<br> Oh God!--my friend,--I never can repay you;<br> Thanks are too poor to speak my gratitude.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --Come with me hence, I'll lead you to a cottage<br> That's seated on the green declivity<br> Of yonder hill.<br>   <i> Mar.</i> --We will follow you.--<br> Learn hence, Alphonso, never to complain<br> Of Fortune's gifts,--and ne'er despond again.<br> Heav'n holds the scale, and justice guides the beam.<br> We rise and fall by turns at each extreme.<br> <br> <br> 	ACT III.--SCENE I.--<i> Elmira's dwelling, near the banks of the Hudson</i> --<br> 			<i> Enter Elmira, weeping</i> <br> <br>   <i> Elm.</i> --Now be the sun for-evermore obscured;<br> And blotted from the pages of the sky;<br> Be all those adverse stars the characters<br> Of my unhappy fate:--Thick and unwholesome mists<br> Wrap the green earth, that nature's self may sicken,<br> And with one deep and mighty groan expire.<br> Alphonso, buried in the whelming wave!<br> Are these the joyful tidings that portend:<br> O Clementine thou has deceived thy friend,<br> With false, deceitful hopes--what have I now<br> To live for,--since Alphonso is no more.<br> But I will not survive him,--love forbid it--<br> I will not live,--my plighted faith forbid it.<br> Alphonso,--<i> Death</i>  shall not dissolve our vows,<br> Elmira follows thee--this very night!--<br> Yea, ere the sun, with his descending beams<br> Plays on the turrets of the city spires,<br> This vial shall unite us yet once more:<br> I'll keep thy counsel;--her comes Clementine.<br> <br> 		<i> Enter 2d Spir. in form of Clemnentine.</i> <br> <br>   <i> Spir.</i> --How fares my gentle friend?--<br>   <i> Elm.</i> --Why--so--I have received some tidings.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --What are they, sweet Elmira?<br>   <i> Elm.</i> --Have you heard nothing lately of importance<br> That much concerns me?<br> <i> Spir.</i> --	Why nothing,<br> But that Alphonso shortly will return.<br>   <i> Elm.</i> --Clementine, thou knowest<br> How long I mourn'd his absence;--daily I<br> To yonder tree, where often we have met<br> And interchanged our vows of mutual love:<br> thither I would repair, and think on him,<br> And thinking so, the summer's day seem'd short.<br> O Clementine, I ne'er shall see him more!<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --This is self-tormenting:<br> Ideal fears that haunt the sick man's breast,<br> And rob the tender virgin of her rest.<br> Art thou not well my friend?--<br>   <i> Elm.</i> --I shall be better shortly.<br>   <i> Spir.</i> --Sweet I hope so.<br>   <i> Elm.</i> --Leave me Clementine.--[<i> Ex.
