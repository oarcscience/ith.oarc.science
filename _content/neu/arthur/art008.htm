He first had call'd<br>  Her by that name, Isolt of the White Hands,<br>  When those white hands had heal'd him of his hurt<br>  Got in some tourney held in Brittany,<br>  And she had lov'd him for the name, and thought,<br>  "Full surely is he mine as I am his;"<br>  And this had lasted but the waxing old<br>  Of the same moon that crescive saw them wed.<br>  Then he had left her taking slight farewell,<br>  And over seas had come no word from him<br>  Of bale or comfort, and a year was past.<br>  Now as she mus'd on love, and musing felt<br>  Aweary of her life because no love<br>  Was had for her, the tempest-driven rain<br>  Beat at the casement, and small puffs of wind<br>  Flutter'd the flame that burnt upon the hearth,<br>  And stirr'd the many-coloured tapestries<br>  That lin'd the wall; and once a fiercer gust,<br>  It seem'd, drave ope the door, and with the wind<br>  And rain there came one trailing dripping weeds<br>  Of samite after.  Then Isolt thereat<br>  Rais'd eyes amist with tears, and thro' these saw<br>  Her cousin, sharp of tongue, sharper of face,<br>  Of all men call'd Maid Marian the curst,<br>  And gave a doubtful welcome.  Thereupon<br>  The sharp-fac'd damsel, clanging to the door,<br>  Laught shrilly, crying out the while:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your guest,<br>  Good cousin, is not to your mind, meseems."<br>  Thereat Isolt, as stung to courtesy<br>  Perforce, would fain have call'd for lights, and food<br>  And all things needful, had not she, the maid,<br>  Shook off in haste constraining hands and cried:<br>  "I care not for your simple kindnesses,<br>  Cousin Isolt;" then louder, "I have news<br>  Of him you call your Tristram, so much yours<br>  Indeed as any knight may be the prize<br>  Of one among a score of maidens whom<br>  He loves and leaves."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this, Isolt the White,<br>  Trembling to hear what she for long had fear'd<br>  To hear, had murmur'd, "False, my cousin, false,"<br>  But that Maid Marian shrill'd it once again:<br>  "Ay! yours and hers, and woman's else<br>  On whom his fancy lights," and crying out<br>  On all false lovers, fled into the dark<br>  That clos'd about her, and Isolt was left<br>  To such small comfort as her prayers might yield.<br>  <br>  But when the morrow brake upon a world<br>  Washt clean with tempest, light'd by a sun<br>  That drave the mists before in streaming lines<br>  Of golden vapour, she, the white Isolt,<br>  Out of a tender heart was fain to doubt<br>  The word Maid Marian brought, had not the maid<br>  Stood once again before her crying, "Come!<br>  Sad cousin, and behold your lord."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they,<br>  The twain, took ship, past over seas, and came<br>  To where Tintagel with its crown of towers,<br>  Defies with frowning might of splinter'd crag<br>  The stormful tossing seas of Lyonnesse.<br>  There, favour'd by the tangl'd arms of trees<br>  That stretcht deep shadows on the landward side<br>  Of the huge castle, went they by a path<br>  That led with many windings to the tower<br>  Of Queen Isolt of Britain, she men call'd<br>  The Fair.  Within her bower she lay asleep<br>  Upon an azure-broider'd silken couch,<br>  And half her robe had slipt aside and show'd<br>  A silver skin glossy as satin, fair<br>  As none was fair before in all that land.<br>  <br>  At her Maid Marian pointed hissing, "See!<br>  The false queen whom false Tristram loves."  Then she,<br>  Isolt of the White Hands beholding Queen<br>  Isolt the Fair, belov'd of Tristram, knew<br>  That never would he leave that woman there,<br>  That woman in the high tide of her youth,<br>  That woman with the glory in her hair,<br>  For her, his faded wife of Brittany,<br>  For her, his pale Isolt of the White Hands,<br>  And bitter was this knowledge unto her,<br>  And bitter, too, the cry within her heart<br>  At thought of it.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as they drew behind<br>  The silken hangings of the room, the queen<br>  Awoke, a step came up the circling stair,<br>  And Tristram enter'd, whom all women lov'd.<br>  On him the twain gaz'd through the narrow rents<br>  That time had worn within the hangings' folds<br>  And saw him stoop to greet the queen with kiss<br>  Such as he never yet had laid upon<br>  The lips of her of Brittany, and heard<br>  Those false ones utter their adult'rous love<br>  Till gloom had fallen, and King Mark, whom none<br>  Remember'd, softly stole into the bower<br>  And from behind false Tristram clove his skull<br>  From crown to nape.  So died the sinful knight<br>  Belov'd of women, slain by him he wrong'd.<br>  But she, Isolt the Fair, beholding him<br>  She lov'd dead at her feet, and him she loath'd<br>  Holding the sword, rais'd such a storm as husht<br>  The outcry of those twain in hiding there,<br>  And swiftly moving to the casement's edge,<br>  And shrieking, "Him I follow whom I love,"<br>  Leapt into that white surge which foam'd below,<br>  And past to judgement as the sinful pass.<br>  <br>  Then came the white Isolt with Marian<br>  Forth from her place, and stood beside the dead<br>  Sir Tristram, crying, "He is mine, none else<br>  May claim him dead, for he was mine, not hers;"<br>  Whereat the king star'd full upon her.  Face<br>  And voice alike he knew not, but some thought<br>  That she too was by Tristram wrong'd, mov'd him<br>  To growl in churlish answer,<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Woman, take<br>  The man you claim, if you will have him dead<br>  Who living little lov'd you, as I deem,"<br>  Then turn'd and past adown the stair, but sent<br>  No long time after two stout churls to bear<br>  Dead Tristram forth where these two women will'd.<br>  <br>  So white Isolt bore home her murder'd lord<br>  Across the sea to Brittany, and there<br>  Entomb'd him piously like some dead saint,<br>  And made a pleasaunce all about where vine<br>  And flower grew thickly, and would walk therein<br>  At morning, noon, and even, silently,<br>  Till three slow twelvemonths past, when there was dole<br>  In Brittany.  So hers they made the tomb<br>  She built for sinful Tristram of the Woods,<br>  And after that long sorrow follow'd peace.<br>  <br>  But one whom Tristram lov'd in earlier times,<br>  Maid Marian, when she was fair as she<br>  That wedded Mark, came when Isolt was dead<br>  And pac'd the pleasaunce silently at morn<br>  And noon and even, sowing seeds of some<br>  Strange plant from far-off lands, that bloom'd when next<br>  The summer came, in fair white silver bells<br>  Of fragrance such as no man in that land<br>  Had knowledge of, and by the tomb of him<br>  All women lov'd she laid the fiery-edg'd<br>  And many-wrinkl'd shells that hold within<br>  Themselves the voices of the sea.  And when<br>  The autumn tempests came upon that shore,<br>  Driven from streaming seas, she flitted through<br>  Her wind-torn, faded, dripping pleasaunce like<br>  Some wan leaf flying before the gale.  And high<br>  At such times shrill'd her voice in broken song,<br>  That seem'd the harsh note of some bird at sea.<br>  <br>  "False life! false love! Oh, why was I deceiv'd?<br>  False heart! false love, that I, poor maid, believ'd!<br>  False life! false love, that me of hope bereav'd!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False heart, false love!<br>  <br>  False lips! false tongue that spake false vows to me!<br>  False face! false eyes, whence truth did turn and flee!<br>  False hand! false heart that brake sweet love's decree!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False life! false love!"<br>  <br>  But when the spring was nigh there came to her<br>  A little comfort from the budding leaf,<br>  As still she pac'd the pleasaunce sowing seeds<br>  Of that strange plant, and year by year there bloom'd<br>  Within it such a wilderness of branch<br>  And flower and wandering vine as none had seen<br>  The like.  Now fifty tides of Martinmas<br>  Were past and over when there came a gale<br>  Fiercer than any on that wind-swept coast,<br>  And in the night above the storm some heard<br>  The song that ancient Marian sang at whiles<br>  Of false love and false life, and hearing shook<br>  With fear of some dread thing.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those who stirr'd<br>  Upon the morrow earliest beheld<br>  Within the pleasaunce, on the tomb of him<br>  All women lov'd, the dead maid Marian.<br>  About her brows was wound a faded scarf<br>  That dead Sir Tristram wore as knight of hers<br>  Full sixty dusty summers back at some<br>  Forgotten tourney held in Brittany,<br>  And in her hand was claspt a golden chain<br>  That he had given her, and some there were<br>  Who held that death had made her fair again,<br>  Working a miracle for very ruth.<br>  So past her soul to judgment and its rest.<br>  But when three days were past there stood ten maids<br>  Arow within the pleasaunce strewing blooms<br>  Of latest autumn on the tomb disturb'd<br>  Once more to hold the dust of Marian.<br>  <br>  Full quickly glide the years, and none of all<br>  Who knew that land in those dim days are left,<br>  Yet still the pleasaunce shows an isle of green<br>  Midmost of a wide, open, herbless space,<br>  A desolate, waste country no man tills.<br>
