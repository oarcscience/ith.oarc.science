Now suffering--misfortune--comes within the sphere of reason only if it is brought about by the free will of the subject, who must be entirely moral and justifiable; as must be also the power against which that subject proceeds.  This power must be no merely natural one, nor the mere will of a tyrant: because it is only in such case that the man is himself, so to speak, guilty of his misfortune.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In genuine tragedy, then, they must be powers both alike moral and justifiable, which from this side and from that come into collision.  Two opposed Rights come forth: the one breaks itself to pieces against the other: in this way both alike loss: while both alike are justified, the one towards the other: not as if this were right, that other wrong."<br>                            HEGEL.

You are not yet for death;<br> Men say you cannot die.<br>   <i> Arthur.</i>                'Tis true, long since<br> I do remember it was told of me<br> I should be hurt to death and yet not slain,<br> But by the will of our Lord Jesu brought<br> Into another place, and come again<br> To win the Holy Cross.  I cannot tell;<br> 'Tis a dark saying: rather, as I deem,<br> To-night, after the fashion of this world<br> My life must change.<br>   <i> Bedivere.</i>           To-night?  So Britain sinks!<br> Ah! my Lord Arthur, what shall save us now--<br> A torn and kingless people?<br>   <i> Arthur.</i>                     Nay, Bedivere,<br> Not kingless; tide me death betide me life,<br> The realm rides high through all, with Constantine<br> To hold the course I pricked.  Look forward, forward,<br> And let the past, with Arthur and his sins,<br> Fade on the dim horizon far behind!<br> Yet, even so, meseems I shall not die;<br> My purpose lives, my will, that which hath been <br> The life-blood of my spirit, my soul's breath:--<br> What shall a man not suffer and not dare<br> That this may be?  Yea! shall he not for this<br> Tread out the fire upon his own hearth-stone,<br> For this draw steel against the child that sprang<br> Of his own body?  Though my name be lost<br> For ever, and my race with me to-night<br> Fall into dust, that which I willed remains,<br> And while that lives I shall not wholly die.<br> Now make me ere I pass:--Sir Constantine<br> Is King of Britain: see him crowned with speed,<br> And summon all true men to render him<br> Such service and such faith as they would own<br> Towards Arthur come again.  Then shalt thou go<br> Where thou may'st meet with Lancelot: let him wit<br> I died full fain of him, leaning my trust<br> Upon his old remembered nobleness<br> That he will yet repent him.  They are fallen<br> Who brought the realm in peril for his sake;<br> His penance waits him still: let him pray out<br> His life in some lone hermitage, or pass<br> Into the Holy Land where Jesu Christ<br> Was quick and dead.   There may his soul find peace!<br>   <i> Bedivere.</i>   All this shall have fulfilment.  Ah! would God<br> I too had fallen first!<br>   <i> Arthur.</i>                Nay, for lack of thee<br> My words were lost: be thankful, work thy work,<br> And wait God's end for all.  My last command<br> Is this, thou shalt not fail to bring the queen <br> True tale how all befell: what lies beneath<br> Let Silence whisper.<br>                      Farewell Bedivere.<br> God dwell with thee.  This ring to Constantine,<br> Bid him be strong, and rule.<br>    [<i> He falls back dying: the barge puts out to sea.</i> <br> <br>               Finis.<br> <br> <br> <br> ORCHARDLEIGH, <i> April</i>  2, 1893.<br> KENSINGTON, <i> July</i>  23, 1894.<br>
