He will'd to live<br>  Until his errand was all done, and then --<br>  Why, God's good pleasure should hear his Amen!" <br>  <br>  And so he came at last to Ireland's court, <br>  And in the audience-hall, before the throne, <br>  Stood pale and leaning on his sheath&eacute;d sword, <br>  And told his message to the king and queen, <br>  Fainting, in ending, at the princess' feet, <br>  Whose tender eyes dropp'd tears amid the blood<br>  That gush'd afresh, as trembling she essay'd<br>  To quench its flowing with her own warm scarf; <br>  And, as she was well skill'd in surgery's art, <br>  They gave him to her charge to try his cure. <br>  And long she wrestled with the angel Death, <br>  Conquering through prayer, and won him back to life. <br>  And Tristan watch'd her from his couch, and wish'd<br>  He might be ill forever, thus to keep<br>  So fair a picture always in his sight! <br>  And she would do for him, with quiet grace, <br>  All offices that only women can, <br>  When, smote by sickness, men will humbly lean<br>  On the strong tenderness that never fails! <br>  The little hand smooth'd pillows for his head, <br>  Bathed his hot brow, and dress'd his healing wound, <br>  And, when he seem'd to slumber mid his pain, <br>  Plied silken threads to aid her silent watch. <br>  And if sometimes it met his own, 'twas but<br>  The leech's touch to learn the fever's height. <br>  And all about, within her was such sense<br>  Of maiden purity, that Tristan ne'er, <br>  Even by thought of passion, would have stirr'd<br>  Th'unconscious calm of that white, virgin breast! <br>  <br>  So day by day he grew to perfect health, <br>  And, sitting by her in the summer morns, <br>  He taught her how to tune the lute, and sang<br>  Old ditties, mostly battle-songs, or lays<br>  Of sunny France, the harvest-hymns, or plaints<br>  Of captive slaves, -- but never sang of love! <br>  And if her changing cheek did flush and pale, <br>  And her heart throb, she knew 'twas but the tunes, <br>  The music shaking all her inner soul; <br>  And if she did not laugh as she was wont, <br>  But from the castle-terrace gazed long hours<br>  Toward distant Cornwall, all her maids would say, <br>  "She's sad because she leaves us: this quick change<br>  From home to husband weighs her spirits down. <br>  She wonders if he'll love her like her sire! <br>  He must be noble, since the knights he sent<br>  Are gentle, and his herald like a king. <br>  She's worn with watching. Sure her lord may count<br>  Upon the goodness that did patient nurse<br>  The proxy for his sake will call her queen!" <br>  And so they gossip'd on her alter'd ways, <br>  And -- for they knew her all her girlhood up -- <br>  Did never link her name, by sneer or hint, <br>  In thought or speech, with aught that was not true. <br>  <br>  And thus, with this fine honor in them both, <br>  That knew her pledged, they kept them safe through all; <br>  And if perchance o'er Tristan's soul would come<br>  A sudden tempting, when she stept anear, <br>  To seize her in his arms, and kiss her eyes, <br>  Mouth, hands, once strain her to his heart, and then<br>  Tear open his old wound, and pitied die, <br>  He sternly fought it down, and school'd his thought<br>  To say, unshrinkingly, "My uncle's wife!" <br>  <br>  And when their ship was ready, all the court<br>  Did bear her company to the water's edge, <br>  And the whole country mourn'd to see her go. <br>  She wept to know how she was loved, -- to leave<br>  Her childhood's happy home for stranger roof, --<br>  To see no more, perchance, the early friends<br>  That fill'd her memory; and all sights and sounds<br>  Seem'd but to make her sadder as she went, <br>  Until she look'd on Tristan, and her heart<br>  Took a sweet sense of something undefined, <br>  That made her think but of the voyage with him, <br>  Forgetful of the king would crown its end! <br>  And, ere they sail'd, her mother gave in charge<br>  Secretly to Governale, Sir Tristan's squire, <br>  A golden flask full of enchanted wine, <br>  That, on the day when they should wed, King Marke<br>  And her Isonde should drink the same, and so<br>  Either should other love through all their life, <br>  And find expression by its potent spell. <br>  <br>  The August days were languid on the sea; <br>  The vessel linger'd on the glassy calm<br>  Of heaveless waves; and, as they silent sate, <br>  Watching from cabin-window a lone bird<br>  Skimming the surface of the waters blue, <br>  Then, more to break the stillness than from need, <br>  Isonde did murmur that she was athirst; <br>  And Tristan rose to search for welcome draught, <br>  And came back, smiling, with a golden flask, <br>  And told her how he found it in the case<br>  Where Governale did keep his master's helm; <br>  And so -- for such rare liquor fitted not<br>  For lackey's palate, howsoe'er or why<br>  He got and kept it -- Tristan pour'd the wine, <br>  And gave the goblet to the ladye's taste, <br>  Who drank it, saying she would pay instead<br>  To the sly squire a good broad piece or two. <br>  And, partly that the odor was so rich, <br>  And partly that his mouth might touch the rim<br>  Whereon her dewy lip had press'd, he too<br>  Drain'd from the goblet love's o'erwhelming power. <br>  <br>  For, sitting at her feet, with sudden thrill, <br>  Their long-averted looks did meet at last, <br>  As, scarcely heeding, stole his eager hand<br>  Anear to hers, that trembled to his palm, <br>  The while his other arm about her form<br>  Bow'd down her blushing face towards his own. <br>  Love compass'd them with circumstance; for them<br>  The sea, the sky, were not, nor aught but love, <br>  In that enraptured space when scarce time seem'd<br>  To move, so fast th' unnoted moments flew. <br>  The world was in the circle of their arms, <br>  And their souls mingled in the speechless bliss<br>  That almost grows to pain, and floods the eyes<br>  With causeless tears that break the lofty spell<br>  Of love's pure exaltation, lest the breath <br>  Of the divine in man should waft his soul<br>  So far towards the source that he should pierce<br>  The mysteries of God's secret Paradise. <br>  And, as her bright drops rain'd upon his brow, <br>  He snatch'd her to his heart, and broken words<br>  Restored them unto life, -- "Tristan!" "Isonde!" --<br>  And one long kiss seal'd their eternal troth! <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>
