brighte,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying there by his side:<br>  "The fairest flower is not soe faire:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou never can'st bee my bride."<br>  <br>  I am thy bride, mine owne deare lorde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same whiche thou didst knowe,<br>  That was soe lothlye, and was wont<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the wild more to goe.<br>  <br>  Nowe, gentle Gawaine, chuse, quoth shee,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make thy choice with care;<br>  Whether by night, or else by daye,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I be foule or faire?<br>  <br>  "To have thee foule still in the night,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I with thee should playe!<br>  I had rather farre, my lady deare,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have thee foule by daye."<br>  <br>  What when gaye ladyes goe with their lordes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drinke the ale and wine;<br>  Alas! then I must hide myself,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must not goe with mine?<br>  <br>  "My faire lady&egrave;, sir Gawaine sayd,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I yield me to thy skille;<br>  Because thou art mine owne lady&egrave;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt have all thy wille."<br>  <br>  Nowe blessed be thou, sweete Gaw&agrave;ine,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the daye that I thee see;<br>  For as thou seest mee at this time,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soe shall I ever bee.<br>  <br>  My father was an aged knighte,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet it chanced soe,<br>  He tooke to wife a false lady&egrave;,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whiche broughte me to this woe.<br>  <br>  She witch'd mee, being a faire yonge maide,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the greene for&egrave;st to dwelle;<br>  And there to abide in lothlye shape,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like a fiend of helle.<br>  <br>  Midst mores and mosses; woods, and wilds;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead a lonesome life:<br>  Till some yong faire and courtlye knighte<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolde marrye me to his wife:<br>  <br>  Nor fully to gaine mine owne trewe shape,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was her devilish skille;<br>  Until he wolde yielde to be rul'd by mee,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let mee have all my wille.<br>  <br>  She witchd my brother to a carlish boore,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him stiffe and stronge;<br>  And built him a bowre on magicke grounde,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live by rapine and wronge.<br>  <br>  But now the spelle is broken throughe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wronge is turnde to righte;<br>  Henceforth I shall bee a faire lady&egrave;,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hee be a gentle knighte.<br>
