A path runs across; on the right side the big rocks stand; on the left the ground is less broken.  It is the first day of May, the wood is all green, and the wild flowers blooming.  There is a sound of running water, and many birds sing in the trees.</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Enter Sir Mordred, Sir Agravaine, and Sir Gawain.</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Curse those little feathered devils, all<br>  The trees are full of them, singing as if <br>  The air were silver sweet with feast bells,<br>  And the world were sweet, and life sweet and free<br>  From hate.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Come, come, my lord, let the birds alone, their notes<br>  Are sweet and limpid like the lives of simple <br>  Men in this world.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, squeeze your stale morals from nature, brother,<br>  For every weather a mood.  As if she had <br>  Not planted in our bloods the heaviness<br>  Of hate, as I do hate Sir Launcelot,<br>  And scorn the white-souled Arthur.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  And I do hate this lusty knight.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Brothers, brothers, stint your noise.  Ye know<br>  And well that had Sir Launcelot not proved<br>  Himself in our behalf, we had been by now<br>  Full cold at the heart-root.  He hath saved us all,<br>  And many a time, has wen-<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Small matter that.  He hath a joy in heat <br>  And struggle.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Small matter very like, and men do hate <br>  The objects of their own ingratitude.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Daily and nightly he is with the queen.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Ye know it not.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, do we.  And the king is shamed--<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Nay, nay, spare that, you care not for Arthur, 'tis<br>  Some privy hate you bear the queen, or grudge<br>  Against Sir Launcelot.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Tush!  'tis all prattle.  Lend me your ear, good brother.<br>  Come, think you not in any of us three<br>  Were stuff for a king?<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Thou king?  Said I not so?  Shame, Mordred, shame!<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Nay, nay, brother Mordred, 'tis the general cause<br>  That moves thee, 'member that, the general cause.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Be not so busy, I pray you, for of this<br>   Will the whole realm be mischieved.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Fall what may, what I have said I have said.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  That I believe, for thou hadst ever a tooth<br>  For all unhappiness.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  King Arthur hath consented to this plan<br>  To take the queen by force and lie in wait<br>  For Launcelot to rescue her.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Take the queen, thou sayest?<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Then some romantic hour to catch the two<br>  Together.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Take the queen?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Hist!  here's two-the first is Idawc<br>  Of Cornwall; 'tis your poetical,<br>  Gapes-at-a-ballad cub-he'll be with us.<br>  And old Sir Kay, sour as curds.  <i> (Enter Idawc and Sir Kay.)</i>   How now<br>  Fair lords?  We speak of the widening reft betwixt<br>  The king and the queen, what think you?<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Tis a great tangle, this marriage knot.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  The king consents?  To snare the queen?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Consents, though we had nigh not brought him to it.<br>  He hath a deeming strong as ours, but shuns<br>  The outcome of such publishment of falseness<br>  In the heart of the realm.  'Tis a dreamer, and his world <br>  Peoples itself with airy shapes, and stretches<br>  Rapt vistas for his eye to travel in,<br>  Conversing with visions.  They say he hath<br>  Small ear for the queen but hourly weigheth him<br>  Some cloud-vast enterprise or famous venture,<br>  So that his kingdom is his spouse and not <br>  The queen.  To him she is fair womanhood,<br>  The finer element within the scheme,<br>  And not a woman.  Therefore being human-<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  True, dost thou--<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  True, most true.  It is no king men see,<br>  But is a mist.<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  Dost thou remember once at harvest time-<br>  'Twas at the dying twilight, and the moon,<br>  Drowsily waking from the dusky east,<br>  Did shed a glamourous vapour o'er the water,<br>  Bargemen hither, thither ran to light <br>  Their torches, music strummed, and on the bank<br>  Thronged with embarkings for the river pageant-<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Came what-well what is't at the pageant?  Here's <br>  No time for fooling, youth.<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  Why, on a barge sheathed all in golden samite,<br>  We saw the white queen like fair summer wings<br>  Upon a lotus flower.  There apart<br>  Stood Arthur musing, chin in hand, or gazed <br>  On the stars, and sad dim space, as he would read<br>  Their meaning.  Lo!  one said, "Seest not the queen <br>  Upon yon barge, my lord?"  Arthur turned<br>  Where she did beckon him to look on her,<br>  And said, "White hue on yellow, sure some sign,<br>  Fair virtue thus surmounteth jealousy."<br>  So killed all joyaunce with his moral carp.<br>  But Launcelot beheld her as a vision,<br>  And cried, all dazed with her loveliness,<br>  "God's life, thou'rt fairer than the heaven!"<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Odds, by my beard, 'tis past my patience.<br>  What woman cares to prate of attributes,<br>  Of whys and wherefores and such moral twaddle?<br>  These axioms be poor pudding for their stomachs<br>  When they might hear men sing their beauty's praise-<br>  <br>  <i> Idawc</i> <br>  Fie, my lord!<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Fie not.  The king is blinded with star-dust,<br>  For once I ventured:  "If thou thoughtest more<br>  Of this same fleshly world, my lord,<br>  'Twere better haply for thee and for it."<br>  Said I, "There's holiness as true, I wis,<br>  About the humblest, rushlit cottage door <br>  As at the Portal of the Starry Lamps.<br>  Men's souls need human fellowship to ripen <br>  Them for God, as many twigs do lift <br>  Higher the flame."  Methought in that<br>  I was fair eloquent-<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  And he-mark me it was some ponderable <br>  Stuff he spake-<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  He turned and said, "Here in this life the soul<br>  Is solitary and yearns ever toward<br>  The Solitary, the Great One beyond."<br>  Meaning somewhat I dare say, for he bent<br>  Upon me his wide-dreaming eye<br>  Till I was wildered with their steady burning.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Come, 'tis no time now for remembrances.<br>  Soon come the knights to hear our plot.  They will<br>  Lend hands, for ever trouble-brew draws men.<br>  From diverse causes-<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Aye, some like me for stubborn certainty <br>  Desire to prove at all costs what they know.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Be not too sure.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  For some men rather would be sure and die<br>  Than live in midst of doubtings.  Ah how,<br>  How if this cause splits brothers thus, will all<br>  The court be rent!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Some for gain-<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Aye, you will reward them, brother.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  I did not say so.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Leave wrangling, they are at hand.<br>  <br>  <i> (Enter knights, Sir Bors, Sir Uriens, Sir Tor, and others.  All wear blank shields.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Good morrow, fair knights!  The time doth press, come,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come,<br>  Ring me round here, and let me speak our plan.<br>  Who here knows not the shame that flares at court,<br>  Open as day?  Think not the king deceived;<br>  He hath a deeming, but he is full loth to speak,<br>  Seeing how ofttimes Sir Launcelot hath served<br>  The king and the queen and saved their worship.<br>  And if we take not Launcelot with the queen<br>  And make accusal, you know the accuser must<br>  Prove't on Sir Launcelot himself; the which <br>  No living wight hath yet done.  But if <br>  We take him-<br>  <br>  <i> Meliagraunce</i> <br>  But, my lord, how may this be done?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Peace, and I will tell you.  This day<br>  Is the queen's maying and even now she rides<br>  To woods and fields.  With her come ten of the Queen's<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knights,<br>  Who ride thus ever near to her, and joust <br>  For her, and wear no manner of arms but hers.<br>  They shall be dressed in green and white, and go<br>  Gathering herbs and flowers to deck themselves<br>  For maying.  There'll be songs-<br>  <br>  <i> Meliagraunce</i> <br>  Well?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Well, I saw them start, and they shall come <br>  This way, and we will take them.<br>  <br>  <i> (Confusion.)</i> <br>  <br>  Nay, nay, stir not, nor mutter discontent,<br>  But hear me.  We will take the queen and hers<br>  To my castle hard by, she will send in secret <br>  Unto Sir Launcelot and he will come.<br>  <br>  <i> Meliagraunce</i> <br>  Aye, he will come, mark you he will come!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, he will come.  We'll seem to yield, then take<br>  Him later with the queen.  The king himself shall<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see it.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Sir Launcelot will come to rescue her,<br>  The king shall be brought, and we shall catch our birds <br>  Together.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Here's Cador and Breuse linked arm in arm, and drunk<br>  As always.  'Tis strange they lack preferment<br>  At court.  Now sure 'twill not be long for them,<br>  Such worthlessness could never fail to be<br>  Rewarded by the state.  Sir Breuse hath bound<br>  A tavern garland on his brow, and look,<br>  Cador hath him a bread-cake for a shield.<br>  <br>  <i> (Enter Cador and Breuse.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Steady, steady!<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Steady!  We go to make a kingdom now.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Aye, we be statesmen, and 'twere well to walk<br>  Straight.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  'Tis a hard matter.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Keep hold on me, and 'twill be well.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Aye, that's politic.  Ho!  young sops,<br>  What is't in the air?<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  'Tis a new king I scent, methinks.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  We have no time for them, come, come!  Doubt not<br>  But we shall catch our birds together.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Catch them together-how?  Think you the queen<br>  Will bide an hour longer than need be <br>  In thy black walls?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  That I do.  Sir Launcelot hath pained<br>  Himself too much already on her part,<br>  She will keep low to 'scape the scandal.  That,<br>  Or we can hobble up her knights that they<br>  Will not depart so speedily.  The queen <br>  Will not desert them methinks.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Scandal!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i>  Aye, scandal, 'tis the eye of the matter.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Scandal, what is scandal?<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Tis piety with a bit of news to tell.<br>  A fair garland thou hast, my lord.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  To keep my memory green, belike.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  The fruit of the vine is within, is't not?  A gallant <br>  Shield hast thou, Cador.  'Twill keep off death.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Truly it may be.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Nay, nay, eat not thy defence, brave lord.  Stand up!<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Twere more avail to swallow thy spear, methinks.<br>  'Twould help thee stand.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Art thou the king, Sir Mordred, yet-yet?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Silence, thou muddled fool.  Not yet, nor ever!<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  I went to say I could not worship thee.<br>  I serve the fallen angel that the priest<br>  Told me of, naming him not.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Angel?<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Wine, 'tis a fallen angel.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  Keen-carved, Sir Garland.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Sure one would listen at thine ear as at<br>  A sea-shell for the empty roaring.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  'Tis no time for such chaffering.  Get them aside,<br>  Good Sir Kay, stop but their noise and I <br>  Were much beholden to you.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  'Twould merit somewhat.  Come, ye princely wits,<br>  Let me but tell my latest dream-'twas that<br>  A shower of wine will fall this Friday next-<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Wine!  Haste thee, Breuse, find one that hath a moat<br>  To sell.  Good Sir Kay, tell more!<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Come then and I will satisfy you.  <i> (They go to the left of the stage.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  My lords, let me speak.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Nay, hear him not, my lords, for he had rather<br>  Corruption bred and rotted at the court<br>  Than he should stir his sluggish feet in struggle.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  Craven!  Fie!<br>  <br>  <i> Second Knight</i> <br>  We'll hear Sir Gawain.<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  Sir Gawain!  Sir Gawain!  Fie!  Craven!  Sir Gawain!<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Hear me briefly.  My lords, it is a grievous <br>  Thing to wreck a good man's fortune.  God<br>  Will break the evil.  Therefore have we no need<br>  To avenge the king.  That Launcelot is false ye <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know<br>  Not yet, but know if he be found so what<br>  Will fall on us.  Shipwreck and storm and split-<br>  Arthur is king, but Launcelot hath lands,<br>  Hath bournes and territories of huge extent<br>  Here in this island, and doth own a realm<br>  In Fraunce, castles and followers.  Let but <br>  Discord raise her head between them two,<br>  And this demesne of Britain will be rent<br>  In twain, racked and overwhelmed; the fellowship<br>  Of the King's Round Table broke, the noblest face<br>  And form of chivalry be felled and gutted<br>  In a civil strife.  And if in truth-<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Hurry, man, art thou old Nestor come<br>  Back from Hell, and windier than ever?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  True, brother.  Come closer, Sir Knights, and ye<br>  Shall see the better justice of our plans.  <i> (They withdraw to left.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Kay (on the right)</i> <br>  Calm thee, calm thee!  Spare thy words.  The world <br>  Hath deafened itself already with much speech.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse (mounts a rock)</i> <br>  I'll be a king, have I not a crown?<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  But little in it.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Brains were not missed in a king, good sir.  He is<br>  My friend.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  I will be an historical king, and marry <br>  Me three wives.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Nay, sweet friend, when thou art king, wed not.<br>  King married is not king, but the queen's husband.<br>  <br>  <i> Breuse</i> <br>  Weep not, thou mayst serve me.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Aye, listen yonder.<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  If Launcelot doth then love the queen, hath he<br>  Not championed her more than the saintly Arthur?<br>  If still ye head on this I say I am <br>  Not with you, and depart.<br>  <br>  <i> Bors</i> <br>  Nor will I hear your tales, nor share your counsels.<br>  <br>  <i> Blamor</i> <br>  Nor I be traitor 'gainst the noblest knight<br>  In all the world.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Wilt thou take hence that two?<br>  <br>  <i> Gawain</i> <br>  Glad were I.  When they be sober they<br>  Will give me thanks.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Go, Cador, and thou Breuse, this man hath found<br>  A fishpond lately dried.  'Twill hold thy wine.<br>  <br>  <i> Cador</i> <br>  Come, come, good Sir.  What is't to Friday?  <i> (Exeunt Gawain, Breuse, Cador, Bors, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Blamor.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  They are like some fishes, my lord, and dread the light.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Let Launcelot and the queen be caught.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  Ho!  Sir Kay, 'tis the cream, the cake of solid<br>  Sense.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Silence, I pray you.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Have I not told the king to tread on Earth?<br>  Answer me that.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Yea, yea, greybeard.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Once Sir Launcelot changed mail with me<br>  And saved me at a venture.  Odds, at my<br>  Best feasts they cannot eat for love.  I had served<br>  Him for his courtesy-leave out the queen-<br>  And I had fed him fat as the Duke of Dutchmen.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Rattle your keys, Sir Kay, instead of your tongue,<br>  Your jams are sweeter than your words.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Sweeter for thy tongue haply; for it<br>  Hath tasted of more jam than of wise words.<br>  <br>  <i> Tor</i> <br>  The shame burns deep, the purging of the court<br>  Will uplift all the realm and bring to bloom <br>  Again the chaste flower of the earlier days.<br>  <br>  <i> Persaunt</i> <br>  Nay, I dare swear my lady's purity.  Be the truth<br>  As it may, shame unto a man that speaks<br>  Shamefully of a lady and a queen.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  You wear fresh flowers, youth, but they will fade.<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  I am against this thing.  Let it be tried, Cowards!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I!<br>  <br>  <i> (Confusion, and the taking of sides.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Thus is the whole court rent to many minds,<br>  The venture is dangerous.<br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  Nay, speak to them with that tongue of thine and they<br>  Will follow--<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Fair lords, young knights full of the noble fire<br>  Of youth, put up your swords, hear me!<br>  <br>  <i> (Confusion.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Knights</i> <br>  Sir Mordred!  Fie!  Cowards!  Sir Mordred!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  My lords, none of us would the queen took hurt<br>  From this we go to do.  Think ye not so.<br>  The thing is this, doubt like a hidden mould<br>  Eats up the peace of the court--sure the thing<br>  Touches us all equally.  Certain<br>  Evil would I rather choose than blank<br>  Uncertainty.<br>  <br>  <i> Knight</i> <br>  And after she is ta'en, my lord, what then?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Then I will feign hot love for her, and threaten<br>  Masteries.  Sir Launcelot will come<br>  And we shall see what door the wind blows in.<br>  <br>  <i> (There is the sound of talk and laughter.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Agravaine</i> <br>  They come.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  'Tis too late but to prove the thing as planned.<br>  <br>  <i> Persaunt</i> <br>  Would I had kept out of this.<br>  <br>  <i> Kay</i> <br>  Too late for temperance after the lips are wet.<br>  <br>  <i> (Exeunt all, hiding themselves behind rocks and trees to the left.  Enter the queen with twelve knights and three ladies, all in green and white, wearing wreaths and bearing garlands of flowers.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  But leave, good sirs, this hunting talk<br>  Of falcons, jesses, leash and lure, there's love,<br>  We have not spoke of that, and it is May.<br>  Sing my lord, one of the songs you learned<br>  In your knave service at the court.<br>  <br>  <i> Gareth</i> <br>  'Tis but a kitchen song, my lady, sung<br>  By humble wenches at ring-time.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Sir Knight, if thou wert armed, I'd send thee back<br>  To bring me water in thy helmet all<br>  This way, as penance for thy dulness.<br>  Cannot the humblest woman sing her love,<br>  My lord?  Love maketh any woman as <br>  A queen, I pray you sing.<br>  <br>  <i> Gareth (sings)</i> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-thorn blossoms blow,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweet buttercups in the grass,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go woo, my lad, go wooing!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In winter frosts the blood is slow,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lusty May makes every lass<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come smiling to your wooing.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weave marigolds within your hair,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go woo, my lad, go wooing,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For spring makes all the lasses fair<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ready for your wooing!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  'Tis a fair chaunt.  Sweet season hath ever sweet song.<br>  Lo!  there a little woodland pool, rimmed round <br>  With crocuses, and tangled water-flags,<br>  Here shepherd's purse and vetch and meadow-sweet--<br>  See how the blue sky lieth in it--come--<br>  And now a cloud sails by.  This is the time<br>  When maids may learn what manner of fortune waiteth <br>  Them, and who their knights haply may be.<br>  Therefore Lyone and Enid and Ygraine,<br>  Bide with me here.  And ye, Sir Knights, shall leave<br>  Us and go on a little space ahead,<br>  And one by one each maid shall search the pond<br>  For her fate's image.<br>  <br>  <i> Lyone</i> <br>  Thou too wilt read thy glass, wilt thou not, my lady?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Nay, nay, I am an aged dame, and all<br>  My ships are in already.

Meanwhile ye shall<br>  Draw lots to find which knight returns.  'Tis he,<br>  By the faith of this blue pond, shall be her lord.<br>  <br>  <i> Gareth</i> <br>  Go now, my lady?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Yea, but go not too far.  And he that wins,<br>  If he be wise, will hasten back<br>  To meet the fair eyes laughing in the pool.<br>  <br>  <i> (Exuent knights to left.)</i> <br>  <br>  I will take me three petals thus and tear<br>  In one a rent--thou seest--and ye shall choose<br>  One each, and she that holdeth the torn leaf--<br>  Wit ye 'tis the pierced heart-- 'tis she shall watch <br>  First in the pool.  Choose quickly.  <i> (They choose.)</i> <br>  Ah, Lyone le Blanche, my lily maid,<br>  'Tis thou; then kneel thee here, one comes.<br>  Child, thy fair hair mingles its pale gold with the <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crocus<br>  Flowers, and is as fair as they.

'Tis a pretty jest to bribe<br>  Beforehand Mother Fortune thus.  Ye shall plight<br>  Your troth with rush-rings from this friendly bank.<br>  Go now, my lord, send others to assay.<br>  <br>  <i> Colgrevaunce</i> <br>  God send another good grace as mine.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Now, Enid and Ygraine, choose ye from these<br>  Two petals, as but now ye chose.  Who has't?<br>  'Tis thou, Ygraine?  Then kneel.  <i> (Ygraine kneels.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Ygraine</i> <br>  Ah, Jesu, keep me, my lady, some reptile stirs<br>  The slime beneath and muddies the whole pool.<br>  'Tis an ill omen, I will not read my lot<br>  To-day.  <i> (Rises.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Enid</i> <br>  Nor I.  See, all is foul, 'tis an ill omen.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Think you?  I will not say these signs are true<br>  Or false, seeing we know not what be hid<br>  From the eye of man.  Yet I like it not.<br>  <br>  <i> Ygraine</i> <br>  Still it muddies, I will not look!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Then let us leave it and go on.  <i> (They start out to the left.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Enid</i> <br>  What noise was that, the sound of bosses clanking<br>  On armed heel?<br>  <br>  <i> (Enter Mordred and the knights.

Out of my way, I like it not.<br>  <br>  <i> (The Queen's Knights have come up on the left; commotion off the stage in that direction.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Hold yet, my knights, 'tis useless, ye have no shields.<br>  If my lord Arthur or Sir Launcelot<br>  They, if they were here, would teach thee how<br>  To budge, thou caitiff Mordred.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, but our lord Arthur is not here,<br>  Nor thy Sir Launcelot.  If either were,<br>  Who knows what he would do?  So I will speak.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Speak then and go.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Hear then and stay.  'Tis long that I have loved thee,<br>  And passing well, and have long eyed my time.<br>  This day I have thee, and thou leavst me not<br>  Till thou dost love with me, or I and all<br>  These my men-at-arms be dead.

Your love and you I spurn<br>  Out of my path like offal.  Know, Sir Mordred,<br>  I had liefer cut my throat in twain<br>  Than love with you.  Who these be, for there<br>  Are knights among your menials here, what men<br>  Of my lord's these be, that lend their hands to you<br>  And do preserve this vile incognito,<br>  I know not, but <i> what</i>  they be I know,<br>  Vile dust to which your spittle give a mould<br>  And shape, without it, formless atoms.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Slow, madam, slow, your hot words cannot sink<br>  In my cold ears.<br>  <br>  <i> (Off the stage to the left, the Queen's Knights break nearer through the ranks <br>  of Mordred's men.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Colgrevaunce</i> <br>  Ho, we come, my lady!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Back, puppets.<br>  <br>  <i> Gareth</i> <br>  Way there, cowards!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Nay, nay, ye are not armed!<br>  <br>  <i> Peleas</i> <br>  Whether we die or not we care not, so <br>  We keep thee safe.<br>  <br>  <i> Colgrevaunce</i> <br>  We care not!

To still<br>  The shame maybe.  Let her then tell,<br>  She cometh now?<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  Not yet, my lord.<br>  <br>  <i> Colgrevaunce</i> <br>  Haply she will tell us when she comes.<br>  Hither, boy, and tell us more of this<br>  Late prowess of Sir Launcelot's.

You were <br>  Too forward in it.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  It was not I, my lord, but those behind<br>  That pushed me on as kinsman to yourself,<br>  Saying the court reeked with the stench of the queen's<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;falseness.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  There's foulness in thy words, I like it not.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  'Twere best forgotten all.

To me she hath been ever fair<br>  And gentle, and to my knights and to all ladies,<br>  A queen among women and a woman among<br>  Queens.  And that Sir Launcelot loves her<br>  I dare say.  He hath succoured her from danger,<br>  As when--<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  But she, my lord, loves she him?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Whether she loveth him I will not say--<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Thou wilt not say.

God hath given him fair seemliness<br>  Of form, and hardiness to work so largely<br>  That he hath had always the better in combat.<br>  And she hath a heart passionate and wild,<br>  But yet her soul beats high--<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Nathless ere this have men said that they took<br>  Long draughts of love together.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Her lofty soul yearns toward the heights, she fain<br>  Would keep the purity of the court, <br>  And love Sir Launcelot as soul loves soul,<br>  But then her eye takes fire at sight of him,<br>  Her veins surge hot with the glory, colour, pomp,<br>  And beauty of this world,--the mortal strife<br>  'Twixt flesh and spirit, which hath won I know not.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  My lord, I speak, methinks, as should become<br>  Your nephew, and I am but an unwilling<br>  Mouthpiece of mine ears.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  It is an old lie.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Yea, my lord, an old lie, and I<br>  Do doubt it altogether.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  It is a lie.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Yet there be whispers in the court.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  And 'twould be well to prove it false.<br>  What whispers?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  About Sir Launcelot and the queen, my lord.<br>  Men say that when Sir Launcelot departs,<br>  She in her secret bosom writhes and welters<br>  Like a madwoman, though she give no sign<br>  Outwardly to men.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  She is the queen.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Aye, my lord, and bears it with a proud<br>  Countenance, as though she felt no fears<br>  Of her love, nor scented her own peril.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  She is the queen.<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Only last night, but 'tis a lie--<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  What is a lie?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  My lord, it is a lie I blush to tell.<br>  Some caitiff swore Sir Launcelot to have come<br>  Here to the queen, even last night.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Came here?  God's life!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Be calm, my lord, my men slept 'fore the door,<br>  He could not enter there, nor by yon threshold<br>  Where the knights sleep.

Why do you hold <br>  The bar as if you fear to fall?<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Hold the bar, my lord?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  You trifle with me, dog, playing parrot thus!<br>  <br>  <i> Mordred</i> <br>  Put up your sword, wild man.

I know not wherefore I am racked<br>  With dread.  But now I did see black shapes hurtle<br>  Think upon the gust; the wind doth reek<br>  With pests and fevers, rank and rotten fogs<br>  Come from the sloughs.  This stinking of the air<br>  Liketh me not.  The stars are stubborn, all<br>  This darkness here is much too thick.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  'Tis so.  But now the moon shined clear, now she<br>  Is gone.  The morbid air doth suck up humours<br>  From the glens, a death-sweet perfume that<br>  But half doth please me.  The heaven is silent,<br>  And round the world the mantle of the dusk<br>  Cloaks heavily.  What noise was that?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  It was the clock at the postern gate that smote.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  What hour, didst thou take count?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Eleven, my lady.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Think you it a lucky hour?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Nay, I know not, but I--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  My lord Sir Launcelot, it was a hapless <br>  Hour that ever we twain met together.<br>  I 'member me the day thou first didst come<br>  To Camelot and the jousts.  Ah, we were young--<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  And I did lack my sword and would have been shamed<br>  Hadst thou not brought it to me wrapped in thy robe.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And I did see thee fight so strong and seemly.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  And I saw thee, Queen Guenevere, saw thee,<br>  Fairest among all women and all queens.<br>  And then as the rising moon looms like a white<br>  Fire from the world's edge, flaming into heaven,<br>  So burned up love through all my veins.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And as the streams of Araby do nurse<br>  The myrtle flower, and the wind and the rain lead up<br>  Till it bursts with prisoned sweetness, so hath love<br>  Opened my heart.  And yet to-night have I <br>  Fears lest no good will come of it.<br>  How often have we made our promises,<br>  Made prayers to the cross that never more we fall<br>  In deadly sin--Alas, Sir Launcelot,<br>  An 'twere not for this earthly taint, thou hadst<br>  Succeeded in the quest.<br>  <br>  <i> (The sound of wind and distant thunder without.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Yea, madam, I had seen the Sangreal<br>  But for this stain to blot it from mine eyes.<br>  Once I saw a great clearness in a chamber,<br>  And in the midst a silver table held,<br>  Covered with red samite from my sight,<br>  The cup that bore the blessed blood of God,<br>  With many angels singing nigh.  And then<br>  The holy vessel of the Sangreal passed,<br>  And the fire smote me in the visage that <br>  I might not see, but only stand, my poor<br>  Eyes hungering, my nostrils filled with the sweet<br>  Savour round.  For never did I battle <br>  For God's sake, but only to win worship<br>  Or be better loved of thee.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Many a night--<br>  <br>  <i> (Thunder.

Together--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Aye, frightened children cowering with dread.<br>  Hark to the bellowing elements!  Methinks<br>  'Tis all the wrath of the world met here to-night.<br>  Look how the wind heaves darkness past the window!<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Come from the lightning's reach.  'Tis well.  What was't?<br>  Many a night, thou saidst?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Many a night, Sir Launcelot, have I <br>  Lain in the castle of silence, when, slowly<br>  Dropping dew-like round the caves of sleep,<br>  Came dreams and separate lives.  And then I saw<br>  That other life our younger visions painted.<br>  Ah, one soul liveth many lives, my lord,<br>  During our days' short span.  Without this taint<br>  The purity of the court were still unbroke,<br>  And still unmarred were chivalry and worship.<br>  But from our love I fear me there will come<br>  Downfall and woe to many.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Grieve not thus o'ermuch.  Dost not know well<br>  God pardoneth all things sooner than despair?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Methought there must be holiness somehow<br>  When soul drinketh up soul for love.  Somehow--<br>  But since it may not be, we needs must grieve<br>  And make but mournful cheer.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Not so, for all the quest and hoped-for heaven!<br>  Surely God wearies of repentant wretches,<br>  And the prostrate flesh of wailing men cumbers<br>  The path of the world too much already.<br>  Let me stand up till I be dead, I cry,<br>  And if I sin I have eternity<br>  To bide the punishment.  I loved thee, thou<br>  Art near me--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Beware!  Thou dost o'erleap thyself, as ever<br>  At the moment's heat.  Yet I do love thee sure<br>  No whit less that thou canst forget nice counsel<br>  In fond madness.

King Arthur,<br>  I own the debt I owe to thee, for thou<br>  Didst give me knighthood, and of thee<br>  Have I had honour and much worship.

'Tis well!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Lords and vassals of this island realm<br>  Hear me speak.  I will say briefly and<br>  Have done.  My lords, I am a woman, whom<br>  The gods built bigger than their wonted mould,<br>  Wilder, more diverse, waging fiercer war<br>  And conflict 'twixt the good and evil.  He<br>  That hath pinions larger than the common flight<br>  Must needs take greater pains lest they be sullied.<br>  My lord Arthur, I have ever loved<br>  Thee since I came from Cameliard,<br>  My father's land, loved thee as men love saints.<br>  Not with the petty pulsing of the veins,<br>  Nor jealousies nor heat of mad desire,<br>  But at the topmost of my soul's bent.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Is that the love men ask of women--good men?<br>  I know not.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Since thou'rt ideal, they that love thee love<br>  Thee as a mystic symbol, or a bodied <br>  Soul of some dear thing, not as frail man.<br>  Thou hast not known the low brown earth, nor it<br>  Known thee.  So wast thou ever loved, and so<br>  Thou hast loved me, however much thou'st loved.<br>  For thou knowst well, my lord, this is no husband's<br>  Nor no lover's jealousy that moves<br>  Thee in this sifting trial thus, but is<br>  The jealous eye the king bends on the crystal<br>  Perfectness of his long-dreamed-of court.<br>  Thy kingdom is thy spouse, my lord, not I.<br>  I fear I speak o'erboldly.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, 'tis no matter.

So have I loved<br>  You both, but differently.  Methinks that God<br>  Hath placed in me such high, opposing tides<br>  That if my soul be shipwrecked he could blame<br>  Me not.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Madam, me seemeth 'twas all love with you.<br>  Were there not other things stirring at court?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  The diverse uses of the world make men<br>  Take love only as a part of the whole <br>  Existence, but women--as a jewel liveth<br>  By the light, so live women by love.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Haply.  And now?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Now--I speak not for the din.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  What if ye be our queen no longer?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Go with me, thou shalt go with me, my lady!<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Queen no more!<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  With Launcelot!

Nay, nay.<br>  I will not so.  Sure life turneth bitter<br>  In the cup, and I must dash it from me.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Where wilt thou turn if thou art queen no longer?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  If he rescue me hence, know ye 'twill be <br>  To the sisters by Boscastle.  There shall I <br>  Be buried from this world, and let my soul<br>  Crowd with its persons my life's stage.  But if<br>  I bide here--<br>  <br>  <i> Cries</i> <br>  Thou'lt burn!

But who am I <br>  That speak?  <i> (She starts out.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, madam, nay, God's life, nay, dost think--?<br>  Stay, thy cause must still be tried.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Queen no more.  Aye, I have had my hour.<br>  This hour my life hath spoken in full tone.<br>  No more I strive in the world, for I am ashamed<br>  Enough of men already.  May I not<br>  Go hence?  I am all undone methinks.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  'Tis I speak for her.  Sir, what man shall judge her?<br>  My lord kinsmen, close round.<br>  <br>  <i> (The kinsmen surround the queen.

I am come to say<br>  Farewell.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Farewell?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  And pity have I more for thee, indeed<br>  Since I have suffered, suffered humanwise.<br>  And yet I do not blame, thou didst no more<br>  Than I to bring the false dome down--no more.<br>  Together we wrought havoc, thou with thy love<br>  Loosing bonds not to be loosed, and I<br>  Seeing men not as men but as symbols vague.<br>  Star-gazing I did lose the earthly road,<br>  And visionary flashes blinded me<br>  That I knew not the common lives.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Such blindness doth tempt men as dark doth thieves.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  The man blindly good is good to himself<br>  Alone--to others he is evil.<br>  And dreamers should be dreamers for themselves<br>  Alone--for plain men facts!  And thou?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  What boots it us to weigh one 'gainst the other?  <br>  I have fought the rich life-passion from my heart,<br>  Pray God I turn not back to it.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>   Yea, cleave to this quiet thou hast found,<br>  Hug silence to thee, lest thou shouldst feel perchance<br>  All the deep wrongs that men can do.  Feigned love<br>  That covers deep designs, ingratitude<br>  And thankless greed, kinsmen at war,<br>  Murder, rapine, blood, despair, and hate,<br>  Trusts betrayed, and confidence despised,<br>  I have felt them all--all.  Truly<br>  I have known the low brown earth, have bit the dirt.<br>  Ah, madam, pray to god to leave thee here<br>  Till Death shatters the flower of thy life.<br>  <br>  <i> (There is the sound of horsemen without, and the noise of arms.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  What clangour is that?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  'Tis my horsemen, I did ride ahead of them<br>  Some space.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Yea, my lord Arthur, all of life is not<br>  This baseness that thou tellst me of.  Are these<br>  Then enemies of thine--nay, my lord, they follow thee<br>  Far as the land lasts to the sea.  I know <br>  There be sweet human things in life for men;<br>  The handclasp of old friends, and friends to share<br>  Sadness and joy, old voices and old sounds,<br>  Sunlight, and walled gardens, and wild moors,<br>  Eye that readeth eye, and heart, heart--<br>  Ah, my lord, there is more sweet than gall--<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Tell me not--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Or gladly we take the gall as well as sweetness,<br>  For whether be the sunlight fierce or mild,<br>  What man but fain would watch the shadow grow<br>  And on the dial of his life mark time,<br>  Rather than darkness and unhoured ways.<br>  <br>  <i> (Dagonet sings without.)</i> <br>  <br>  Ah, there is Dagonet singing a lay<br>  Unto thy knights.  It is an old song that,<br>  And tells how Joseph of Arimithy came<br>  Into this land.  I have heard it oft at court,<br>  At Pentecost, my lord, dost thou remember?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, I know not, madam, that time is gone.<br>  And now farewell, I may not tarry, fare<br>  Thee well.  I know of thee and me that each<br>  Shall not see other ever more with fleshly eye.<br>  And now I must needs hasten and depart<br>  Back to Camelot and the court and strife.<br>  But afterward shall sail to Avalon,<br>  And change my life from this world.<br>  <br>  <i> (From the chapel come the voices of the nuns singing matins.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Not meet again?<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  No mortal meeting.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Alas!<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Nay, madam, nay, haply thou mayest <br>  Be queen, when all the goodly knights I lost<br>  In diverse quests and ventures will awake<br>  From their long sleep, and form in heaven again<br>  The King's Round Table, perfect at last, and there<br>  With shining arms will joust in Christ's fair courts<br>  For diamonds like suns and carcanets<br>  Of little stars.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Ah, God, all the gall of the world takes not<br>  The dreamer from his dreaming!  Thou speakst fair,<br>  But slowly, slowly through the air of time<br>  The drops of life fall on eternity.<br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Yea, they pass slowly, perhaps no man<br>  Can count them, yet they pass.  And when thou hast <br>  Set down thy staff and book, and they have laid <br>  Thee in cold sepulchre, thou shalt not stir<br>  To note the passing years, nor count the moons,<br>  For drums or tramplings or the utmost heat<br>  And noise of human conflict cannot break<br>  The mood and spirit of the dead.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  My lord, tarry!<br>  <br>  <i> (Horns and bugles sound outside.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Arthur</i> <br>  Lo!

There, there!<br>  She hath torn off her veil, the other hand<br>  Hath rent the emblem from her breast, snatched out<br>  The Sacred Heart.<br>  <br>  <i> Sisters</i> <br>  Alas!  Oh!<br>  <br>  <i> (Enter Guenevere.  She drags her veil in her left hand, with her right she has torn off the Sacred Heart.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Oh, I am lost!

Likewise<br>  Meseems our lady the queen still doth glow<br>  After her life's hot span, and her veins pulse<br>  With the rich past.  How faint and tender the bell!<br>  O Death, how subtle art thou in thy coming,<br>  But afterward long night and haply stars.<br>  <br>  <i> Agatha</i> <br>  Rather say that like the moon she burned<br>  In beauty all the night of sin, and then<br>  Did fade in the new day.<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Peace, Sir Launcelot!  Sure I am grown foolish<br>  Thinking on her, poor lady.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Nay, likewise all my thoughts have been on her.<br>  Whether in joyless wood or when<br>  The thin prow scudded o'er the midnight swell,<br>  Or Breton thatches waited in the harbour,<br>  In every land my memory sought her.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  And I.

This old<br>  Head is so racked with care I mind me not.<br>  <br>  <i> Agatha</i> <br>  I know not either.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  Yea, mother, 'tis but one night to the full.<br>  Look!  The sky stirs now faintly with light.<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Hush, she wakes.  Sir Launcelot, go thou<br>  Walk in the cloister.  We will prepare<br>  Her for thy coming when 'tis well.<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Pray you be not o'erlong--I know not how much<br>  Of this frail life she have.<br>  <br>  <i> (Exit Sir Launcelot.)</i> <br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere (waking)</i> <br>  Ah, 'tis dusk!

The sun sank and the slim<br>  Moon lifted her pale beauty into heaven,<br>  And dome and turret glittered in the light.<br>  Then Mary the Mother of God came and took<br>  My hand, and her voice fell sweet upon my weary<br>  Ear--<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Speak to her, boy.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  Alas, I may not for looking on her face!<br>  Hark, there is the nightingale, my lady, Look!<br>  Too--the moon riseth!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  The moon--<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  The moon like a white flame in the trees, like liquid<br>  Silver in among the leaves.  Mother,<br>  I cannot speak!  Oh, my lady!  the moon!<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Distantly rose Camelot out<br>  Of the silver plain.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  And the nightingales--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Aye, all the nightingales in Cameliard<br>  Cannot sing my woes, nor every bird<br>  That sings his tragic plaints of passionate<br>  Mischance can wail my sorrows.<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Nay, madam, sit, thou hast not strength to stand.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  I was a woman and I needed love,<br>  I was a queen to long for courts about,<br>  Strong lords and ladies and gay raiment.<br>  I am a weary human thing that needeth<br>  Rest.

For<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queens<br>  Like other women have strong need of death<br>  At times--oh, I am childish grown--<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Madam, my daughter--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Whose spurs clink walking in the cloister there?<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  One come to see thee and to say farewell.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Farewell, 'tis always farewell in this world.<br>  Is it Sir Launcelot?<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  Yea, daughter, he.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Let him enter.<br>  <br>  <i> (Enter Launcelot.)</i> <br>  <br>  How dost, Sir Launcelot?  Art well?  Whence comest?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>    From Fraunce, my lady.  And thou?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Thou seest I have found peace.<br>  In Fraunce this twelvemonth gone?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  When the sly Mordred bore an open front,<br>  With vassals and kinsmen I had saved the king<br>  But he would have it not.  And I distraught<br>  Got me to my father's land again.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And now?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Now having word of the king's death, I knew<br>  The ravage and the spoil within this isle,<br>  And hasted into boats and blew three days,<br>  And drove into this tortured little harbour,<br>  That thou mightst leave thy sorrows here and go<br>  With me--<br>  <br>  <i> Morwena</i> <br>  With thee?<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Thee?<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  The many-towered castle on the heights,<br>  Below, a little Breton hill with trees<br>  And slow white sheep, and farther west the grey<br>  Rocks smoking in the sun at ebb-tide, heather<br>  And pasture-bell upon the seawind mingling--<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  My lord, thou knowst through thee and me is this<br>  Whole kingdom sore bestead, and the sails of the realm<br>  Veered from the old lodestar of purity.<br>  The Round Table is broke and many knights<br>  Tasted the dolours of death through me and thee.<br>  Therefore I pray thee now, Sir Launcelot,<br>  Look thou not on me evermore.  And well<br>  As I have loved thee, I may not see thee<br>  Again, for now mine eye it turneth not<br>  To the worldward but to God, for my soul's health<br>  Lest I be damned.<br>  <br>  <i> Dagonet</i> <br>  My lady, there be worse than thou now saints<br>  In heaven.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Thou art o'erfond, child.  Then, Sir Launcelot,<br>  Much as I have loved thee, for Christ's sake I may <br>  Not see thee.  Therefore I pray that thou<br>  Depart; and pray for me--<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  I have come far to see thee, but I will<br>  Not trouble thee, poor lady, with fond words.<br>  Sithence thou'lt have it so, I go, yet I <br>  Sail never on the sea to Fraunce again<br>  But to a hermitage, and make my prayers<br>  For thy soul's rest and mine.  I pray thee then,<br>  Before I go, madam, kiss me once<br>  And nevermore.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  Nay, that may I never do--<br>  <br>  <i> Launcelot</i> <br>  Farewell.<br>  <br>  <i> Guenevere</i> <br>  And for our old love's sake, Sir Launcelot,<br>  Do this; when I am dead, come thou with seven <br>  Knights, and carry me to Glastonbury<br>  Where my lord Arthur lieth.

The wood is dark and, save for a rustle of the leafage now and then, silent.  Presently there comes a light through the trees, which heightens and brightens.  The tramp of footsteps is heard growing gradually louder.  Sir Launcelot and his seven knights enter with the queen's bier on their shoulders, and eight torches burning about her.  Her head rests on a cushion, and on her breast is her crown.  A pall of black samite bordered with gold lilies covers her body.  The knights turn in behind a rocky mound, then reappear among the trees.  Then as they go, every now and then, their torches flash further and further away, smaller and smaller points of light amid the columns of the wood, till the last twinkle is gone and the blackness returns.</i> <br> <br>  <center><br> <br> CURTAIN
