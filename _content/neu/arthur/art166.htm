Wot we not<br>  As all his brethren borderers wot<br>  How blind of heart, how keen and hot,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild north lives and hates the south?<br>  Men of the narrowing march that knows<br>  Nought save the strength of storms and snows,<br>  What would these carles where knighthood blows<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trump of kinglike mouth?"<br>  <br>  Swift from his place leapt Balen, smote<br>  The liar across his face, and wrote<br>  His wrath in blood upon the bloat<br>  Brute cheek that challenged shame for note<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How vile a king-born knave might be.<br>  Forth sprang their swords, and Balen slew<br>  The knave ere well one witness knew<br>  Of all that round them stood or drew<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sight was there to see.<br>  <br>  Then spake the great king's wrathful will<br>  A doom for six dark months to fill <br>  Wherein close prison held him, still<br>  And steadfast-souled for good or ill.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when those weary days lay dead<br>  His lordliest knights and barons spake<br>  Before the king for Balen's sake<br>  Good speech and wise, of force to break<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonds that bowed his head.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II<br>  <br>  In linden-time the heart is high<br>  For pride of summer passing by<br>  With lordly laughter in her eye;<br>  A heavy splendour in the sky<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplifts and bows it down again.<br>  The spring had waned from wood and wold<br>  Since Balen left his prison hold<br>  And lowlier-hearted than of old<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld it wax and wane.<br>  <br>  Though humble heart and poor array<br>  Kept not from spirit and sense away<br>  Their noble nature, nor could slay<br>  The pride they bade but pause and stay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till time should bring its trust to flower,<br>  Yet even for noble shame's sake, born<br>  Of hope that smiled on hate and scorn,<br>  He held him still as earth ere morn<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring forth her rapturous hour.<br>  <br>  But even as earth when dawn takes flight<br>  And beats her wings of dewy light<br>  Full in the faltering face of night,<br>  His soul awoke to claim by right<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life and death of deed and doom,<br>  When once before the king there came<br>  A maiden clad with grief and shame<br>  And anguish burning her like flame<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That feeds on flowers in bloom.<br>  <br>  Beneath a royal mantle, fair<br>  With goodly work of lustrous vair,<br>  Girt fast against her side she bare<br>  A sword whose weight bade all men there<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quail to behold her face again.<br>  Save of a passing perfect knight <br>  Not great alone in force and fight<br>  It might not be for any might<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn forth, and end her pain.<br>  <br>  So said she: then King Arthur spake:<br>  "Albeit indeed I dare not take<br>  Such praise on me, for knighthood's sake<br>  And love of ladies will I make<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assay if better none may be."<br>  By girdle and by sheath he caught <br>  The sheathed and girded sword, and wrought<br>  With strength whose force availed him nought<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save and set her free.<br>  <br>  Again she spake: "No need to set<br>  The might that man has matched not yet<br>  Against it; he whose hand shall get<br>  Grace to release the bonds that fret<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bosom and my girdlestead<br>  With little strain of strength or strife<br>  Shall bring me as from death to life<br>  And win to sister or to wife<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fame that outlives men dead."<br>  <br>  Then bade the king his knights assay<br>  This mystery that before him lay<br>  And mocked his might of manhood.  "Nay,"<br>  Quoth she, "the man that takes away<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This burden laid on me must be<br>  A knight of record clean and fair<br>  As sunlight and the flowerful air,<br>  By sire and mother born to bear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A name to shame not me."<br>  <br>  Then forth strode Launcelot, and laid<br>  The mighty-moulded hand that made <br>  Strong knights reel back like birds affrayed<br>  By storm that smote them as they strayed<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the hilt that yeilded not.<br>  Then Tristram, bright and sad and kind<br>  As one that bore in noble mind<br>  Love that made light as darkness blind,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fared even as Launcelot.<br>  <br>  Then Lamoracke, with hardier cheer,<br>  As one that held all hope and fear<br>  Wherethrough the spirit of man may steer<br>   In life and death less dark or dear,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid hand thereon, and fared as they.<br>  With half a smile his hand he drew<br>  Back from the spell-bound thing, and threw<br>  With half a glance his heart anew<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward no such blameless may.<br>  <br>  Between Iseult and Guenevere<br>  Sat one of name as high to hear,<br>  But darklier doomed than they whose cheer<br>  Foreshowed not yet the deadlier year<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bids the queenliest head bow down,<br>  The queen Morgause of Orkney: they <br>  With scarce a flash of the eye could say<br>  The very word of dawn, when day <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives earth and heaven their crown.<br>  <br>  But bright and dark as night or noon<br>  And lowering as a storm-flushed moon<br>  When clouds and thwarting winds distune<br>  The music of the midnight, soon<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die from darkening star to star<br>  And leave a silence in the skies<br>  That yearns till dawn find voice and rise,<br>  Shone strange as fate Morgause, with eyes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That dwelt on days afar.<br>  <br>  A glance that shot on Lamoracke<br>  As from a storm-cloud bright and black<br>  Fire swift and blind as death's own track<br>  Turned fleet as flame on Arthur back<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From him whose hand forsook the hilt:<br>  And one in blood and one in sin<br>  Their hearts caught fire of pain within<br>  And knew no goal for them to win<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But death that guerdons guilt.<br>  <br>  Then Gawain, sweet of soul and gay<br>  As April ere he dreams of May,<br>  Strove, and prevailed not; then Sir Kay,<br>  The snake-souled envier, vile as they<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fawn and foam and lurk and lie,<br>  Sire of the bastard band whose brood<br>  Was alway found at servile feud<br>  With honour, faint and false and lewd,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce grasped and put it by.<br>  <br>  Then wept for woe the damsel bound<br>  With iron and with anguish round, <br>  That none to help her grief was found<br>  Or loose the inextricably inwound<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grim curse that girt her life with grief<br>  And made a burden of her breath,<br>  Harsh as the bitterness of death.<br>  Then spake the king as one that saith<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words bitterer even than brief.<br>  <br>  "Methought the wide round world could bring<br>  Before the face of queen or king<br>  No knights more fit for fame to sing<br>  Than fill this full Round Table's ring<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With honour higher than pride of place:<br>  But now my heart is wrung to know,<br>  Damsel, that none whom fame can show<br>  Finds grace to heal or help thy woe:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God gives them not the grace."<br>  <br>  Then from the lowliest place thereby,<br>  With heart-enkindled cheek and eye<br>  Most like the star and kindling sky<br>  That say the sundawn's hour is high<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rapture trembles through the sea,<br>  Strode Balen in his poor array<br>  Forth, and took heart of grace to pray<br>  The damsel suffer even him to assay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His power to set her free.<br>  <br>  Nay, how should he avail, she said,<br>  Averse with scorn-averted head,<br>  Where these availed not? none had sped<br>  Of all these mightier men that led<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lists wherein he might not ride,<br>  And how should less men speed?  But he,<br>  With lordlier pride of courtesy,<br>  Put forth his hand and set her free<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From pain and humbled pride.<br>  <br>  But on the sword he gazed elate<br>  With hope set higher than fear or fate,<br>  Or doubt of darkling days in wait;<br>  And when her thankful praise waxed great<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And craved of him the sword again,<br>  He would not give it.  "Nay, for mine<br>  It is till force may make it thine."<br>  A smile that shone as death may shine<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spake toward him bale and bane.<br>  <br>  Strange lightning flickered from her eyes.<br>  "Gentle and good in knightliest guise<br>  And meet for quest of strange emprise<br>  Thou hast here approved thee: yet not wise<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the sword from me, I wis.<br>  For with it thou shalt surely slay<br>  Of all that look upon the day<br>  The man best loved of thee, and lay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine own life down for his."<br>  <br>  "What chance God sends, that chance I take,"<br>  He said.  Then soft and still she spake;<br>  "I would but for thine only sake<br>  Have back the sword of thee, and break<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The links of doom that bind thee round.<br>  But seeing thou wilt not have it so,<br>  My heart for thine is wrung with woe."<br>  "God's will," quoth he, "it is, we know,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith our lives are bound."<br>  <br>  "Repent it must thou soon," she said,<br>  "Who wouldst not hear the rede I read<br>  For thine and not for my sake, sped<br>  In vain as waters heavenward shed<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From springs that falter and depart<br>  Earthward.  God bids not thee believe<br>  Truth, and the web thy life must weave<br>  For even this sword to close and cleave<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangs heavy round my heart."<br>  <br>  So passed she mourning forth.  But he,<br>  With heart of springing hope set free<br>  As birds that breast and brave the sea,<br>  Bade horse and arms and armour be<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made straightway ready toward the fray.<br>  Nor even might Arthur's royal prayer<br>  Withhold him, but with frank and fair<br>  Thanksgiving and leave-taking there<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned him thence away.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III<br>  <br>  As the east wind, when the morning's breast <br>  Gleams like a bird's that leaves the nest,<br>  A fledgeling halcyon's bound on quest,<br>  Drives wave on wave on wave to west<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all the sea be life and light,<br>  So time's mute breath, that brings to bloom<br>  All flowers that strew the dead spring's tomb,<br>  Drives day on day on day to doom<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all man's day be night.<br>  <br>  Brief as the breaking of a wave<br>  That hurls on man his thunderous grave<br>  Ere fear find breath to cry or crave<br>  Life that no chance may spare or save,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of joy and glory shone<br>  Even as in dreams where death seems dead<br>  Round Balen's hope-exalted head,<br>  Shone, passed, and lightened as it fled<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of doom thereon.<br>  <br>  For as he bound him thence to fare,<br>  Before the stately presence there<br>  A lady like a windflower fair,<br>  Girt on with raiment strange and rare<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rippled whispering round her, came.<br>  Her clear cold eyes, all glassy grey,<br>  Seemed lit not with the light of day<br>  But touched with gleams that waned away<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of quelled and fading flame.<br>  <br>  Before the king she bowed and spake:<br>  "King, for thine old faith's plighted sake<br>  To me the lady of the lake,<br>  I come in trust of thee to take<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guerdon of the gift I gave,<br>  Thy sword Excalibur."  And he <br>  Made answer: "Be it whate'er it be,<br>  If mine to give, I give it thee,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor need is thine to crave."<br>  <br>  As when a gleam of wicked light<br>  Turns half a low-lying water bright<br>  That moans beneath the shivering night<br>  With sense of evil sound and sight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispering witchcraft's bated breath<br>  Her wan face quickened as she said:<br>  "This knight that won the sword--his head<br>  I crave or hers that brought it.  Dead,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let these be one in death."<br>  <br>  "Not with mine honour this may be;<br>  Ask all save this thou wilt," quoth he,<br>  "And have thy full desire."  But she <br>  Made answer: "Nought will I of thee,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought if not this."  Then Balen turned,<br>  And saw the sorceress hard beside<br>  By whose fell craft his mother died:<br>  Three years he had sought her, and here espied<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart against her yearned.<br>  <br>  "Ill be thou met," he said, "whose ire<br>  Would slake with blood thy soul's desire:<br>  By thee my mother died in fire;<br>  Die thou by me a death less dire."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp flashed his sword forth, fleet as flame,<br>  And shore away her sorcerous head.<br>  "Alas for shame," the high king said,<br>  "That one found once my friend lies dead;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas for all our shame!<br>  <br>  "Thou shouldst have here forborne her; yea,<br>  Were all the wrongs that bid men slay<br>  Thine, heaped too high for wrath to weigh,<br>  Not here before my face to-day<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was thine the right to wreak thy wrong."<br>  Still stood he then as one that found<br>  His rose of hope by storm discrowned,<br>  And all the joy that girt him round<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief as a broken song.<br>  <br>  Yet ere he passed he turned and spake:<br>  "King, only for thy nobler sake<br>  Than aught of power man's power may take<br>  Or pride of place that pride may break<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bid the lordlier man in thee,<br>  That lives within the king, give ear.<br>  This justice done before thee here<br>  On one that hell's own heart holds dear,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs might not this but be.<br>  <br>  "Albeit, for all that pride would prove,<br>  My heart be wrung to lose thy love,<br>  It yet repents me not hereof:<br>  So many an eagle and many a dove,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many a knight, so many a may,<br>  This water-snake of poisonous tongue<br>  To death by words and wiles hath stung,<br>  That her their slayer, from hell's lake sprung,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not ill to slay."<br>  <br>  "Yea," said the king, "too high of heart<br>  To stand before a king thou art;<br>  Yet irks it me to bid thee part<br>  And take thy penance for thy part,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That God may put upon thy pride."<br>  Then Balen took the severed head<br>  And toward his hostry turned and sped<br>  As one that knew not quick from dead<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor good from evil tide.<br>  <br>  He bade his squire before him stand<br>  And take that sanguine spoil in hand<br>  And bear it far by shore and strand<br>  Till all in glad Northumberland<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That loved him, seeing it, all might know<br>  His deadliest foe was dead, and hear<br>  How free from prison as from fear<br>  He dwelt in trust of the answering year<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring him weal for woe.<br>  <br>  "And tell them, now I take my way<br>  To meet in battle, if I may,<br>  King Ryons of North Wales, and slay<br>  That king of kernes whose fiery sway<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth all the marches dire despite<br>  That serve King Arthur: so shall he<br>  Again be gracious lord to me,<br>  And I that leave thee meet with thee<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more in Arthur's sight."<br>  <br>  So spake he ere they parted, nor<br>  Took shame or fear to counsellor,<br>  As one whom none laid ambush for;<br>  And wist not how Sir Launceor,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild king's son of Ireland, hot<br>  And high in wrath to know that one<br>  Stood higher in fame before the sun,<br>  Even Balen, since the sword was won,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew nigh from Camelot.<br>  <br>  For thence, in heat of hate and pride,<br>  As one that man might bid not bide,<br>  He craved the high king's grace to ride<br>  On quest of Balen far and wide<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wreak the wrong his wrath had wrought.<br>  "Yea," Arthur said, "for such despite<br>  Was done me never in my sight<br>  As this thine hand shall now requite<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If trust avail us aught."<br>  <br>  But ere he passed, in eager mood<br>  To feed his hate with bitter food,<br>  Before the king's face Merlin stood<br>  And heard his tale of ill and good,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Balen, and the sword achieved.<br>  And whence it smote as heaven's red ire<br>  That direful dame of doom as dire;<br>  And how the king's wrath turned to fire<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grief wherewith he grieved.<br>  <br>  And darkening as he gave it ear,<br>  The still face of the sacred seer<br>  Waxed wan with wrath and not with fear.<br>  And ever changed its cloudier cheer<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all his face was very night.<br>  "This damosel that brought the sword,"<br>  He said, "before the king my lord,<br>  And all these knights about his board,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath done them all despite.<br>  <br>  "The falsest damosel she is <br>  That works men ill on earth, I wis,<br>  And all her mind is toward but this,<br>  To kill as with a lying kiss<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth, and the life of noble trust.<br>  A brother hath she, --see but now<br>  The flame of shame that brands her brow!--<br>  A true man, pure as faith's own vow,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose honour knows not rust.<br>  <br>  "This good knight found within her bower<br>  A felon and her paramour,<br>  And slew him in his shameful hour,<br>  As right gave might and righteous power<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hands that wreaked so foul a wrong.<br>  Then, for the hate her heart put on,<br>  She sought by ways where death had gone<br>  The lady Lyle of Avalon,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose crafts are strange and strong.<br>  <br>  "The sorceress, one with her in thought,<br>  Gave her that sword of magic, wrought<br>  By charms whereof sweet heaven sees nought,<br>  That hither girt on her she brought<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be by doom her brother's bane.<br>  And grief it is to think how he <br>  That won it, being of heart so free<br>  And perfect found in chivalry,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall by that sword lie slain.<br>  <br>  "Great pity it is and strange despite<br>  That one whose eyes are stars to light<br>  Honour, and shine as heaven's own height,<br>  Should perish, being the goodliest knight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That even the all-glorious north had borne.<br>  Nor shall my lord the king behold<br>  A lordlier friend of mightier mould<br>  Than Balen, though his tale be told<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere noon fulfil his morn."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV<br>  <br>  As morning hears before it run<br>  The music of the mounting sun,<br>  And laughs to watch his trophies won<br>  From darkness, and her hosts undone,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the night become a breath,<br>  Nor dreams that fear should hear and flee<br>  The summer menace of the sea,<br>  So hears our hope what life may be, <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knows it not for death.<br>  <br>  Each day that slays its hours and dies<br>  Weeps, laughs, and lightens on our eyes,<br>  And sees and hears not: smiles and sighs<br>  As flowers ephemeral fall and rise<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About its birth, about its way,<br>  And pass as love and sorrow pass,<br>  As shadows flashing down a glass,<br>  As dew-flowers blowing in flowerless grass,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hope from yesterday.<br>  <br>  The blossom of the sunny dew<br>  That now the stronger sun strikes through<br>  Fades off the blade whereon it blew<br>  No fleetlier than the flowers that grew<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hope's green stem in life's fierce light.<br>  Nor might the glory soon to sit<br>  Awhile on Balen's crest alit<br>  Outshine the shadow of doom on it<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or stay death's wings from flight.<br>  <br>  Dawn on a golden moorland side<br>  By holt and heath saw Balen ride<br>  And Launceor after, pricked with pride<br>  And stung with spurring envy: wide<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far he had ridden athwart strange lands<br>  And sought amiss the man he found<br>  And cried on, till the stormy sound<br>  Rang as a rallying trumpet round<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fires men's hearts and hands.<br>  <br>  Abide he bade him: nor was need<br>  To bid when Balen wheeled his steed<br>  Fiercely, less fain by word than deed<br>  To bid his envier evil speed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried, "What wilt thou with me?"  Loud<br>  Rang Launceor's vehement answer: "Knight,<br>  To avenge on thee the dire despite<br>  Thou hast done us all in Arthur's sight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand toward Arthur vowed."<br>  <br>  "Ay?" Balen said: "albeit I see<br>  I needs must deal in strife with thee,<br>  Light is thy wyte thou layest on me;<br>  For her I slew and sinned not, she<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was dire in all men's eyes as death,<br>  Or none were lother found than I <br>  By me to bid a woman die:<br>  As lief were loyal men to lie,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or scorn what honour saith."<br>  <br>  As the arched wave's weight against the reef<br>  Hurls, and is hurled back like a leaf<br>  Storm-shrivelled, and its rage of grief<br>  Speaks all the loud broad sea in brief,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quells the hearkening hearts of men,<br>  Or as the crash of overfalls<br>  Down under blue smooth water brawls <br>  Like jarring steel on ruining walls,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rang their meeting then.<br>  <br>  As wave on wave shocks, and confounds<br>  The bounding bulk whereon it bounds<br>  And breaks and shattering seaward sounds<br>  As crying of the old sea's wolves and hounds<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That moan and ravin and rage and wail,<br>  So steed on steed encountering sheer<br>  Shocked, and the strength of Launceor's spear<br>  Shivered on Balen's shield, and fear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade hope within him quail.<br>  <br>  But Balen's spear through Launceor's shield<br>  Clove as a ploughshare cleaves the field<br>  And pierced the hauberk triple-steeled,<br>  That horse with horseman stricken reeled,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a storm-breached rock falls, fell,<br>  And Balen turned his horse again<br>  And wist not yet his foe lay slain,<br>  And saw him dead that sought his bane<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrought and fared not well.<br>  <br>  Suddenly, while he gazed and stood,<br>  And mused in many-minded mood<br>  If life or death were evil or good,<br>  Forth of a covert of a wood<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That skirted half the moorland lea<br>  Fast rode a maiden flower-like white<br>  Full toward that fair wild place of fight,<br>  Anhungered of the woful sight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God gave her there to see.<br>  <br>  And seeing the man there fallen and dead, <br>  She cried against the sun that shed<br>  Light on the living world, and said,<br>  "O Balen, slayer whose hand is red,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bodies and one heart thou hast slain,<br>  Two hearts within one body: aye,<br>  Two souls thou hast lost; by thee they die,<br>  Cast out of sight of earth and sky<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that made them fain."<br>  <br>  And from the dead his sword she caught,<br>  And fell in trance that wist of nought,<br>  Swooning: but softly Balen sought<br>  To win from her the sword she thought<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To die on, dying by Launceor's side.<br>  Again her wakening wail outbroke<br>  As wildly, sword in hand, she woke<br>  And struck one swift and bitter stroke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That healed her, and she died.<br>  <br>  And sorrowing for their strange love's sake<br>  Rode Balen forth by lawn and lake,<br>  By moor and moss and briar and brake,<br>  And in his heart their sorrow spake<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose lips were dumb as death, and said<br>  Mute words of presage blind and vain<br>  As rain-stars blurred and marred by rain<br>  To wanderers on a moonless main<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where night and day seem dead. <br>  <br>  Then toward a sunbright wildwood side<br>  He looked and saw beneath it ride<br>  A knight whose arms afar espied<br>  By note of name and proof of pride<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare witness of his brother born,<br>  His brother Balan, hard at hand,<br>  Twin flower of bright Northumberland,<br>  Twin sea-bird of their loud sea-strand,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twin song-bird of their morn.<br>  <br>  Ah then from Balen passed away<br>  All dread of night, all doubt of day,<br>  All care what life or death might say,<br>  All thought of all worse months than May:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the might of joy in love<br>  Brake forth within him as a fire,<br>  And deep delight in deep desire<br>  Of far-flown days whose full-souled quire<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang round from the air above.<br>  <br>  From choral earth and quiring air<br>  Rang memories winged like songs that bear<br>  Sweet gifts for spirit and sense to share:<br>  For no man's life knows love more fair<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fruitful of memorial things<br>  Than this the deep dear love that breaks<br>  With sense of life on life, and makes<br>  The sundawn sunnier as it wakes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where morning round it rings.<br>  <br>  "O brother, O my brother!" cried<br>  Each upon each, and cast aside<br>  Their helms unbraced that might not hide<br>  From sight of memory single-eyed<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The likeness graven of face and face,<br>  And kissed and wept upon each other<br>  For joy and pity of either brother,<br>  And love engraffed by sire and mother,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's natural gift of grace.<br>  <br>  And each with each took counsel meet<br>  For comfort, making sorrow sweet,<br>  And grief a goodly thing to greet:<br>  And word from word leapt light and fleet<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all the venturous tale was told,<br>  And how in Balen's hope it lay<br>  To meet the wild Welsh king and slay,<br>  And win from Arthur back for pay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grace he gave of old.<br>  <br>  "And thither wilt not thou with me<br>  And win as great a grace for thee?"<br>  "That will I well," quoth Balan: "we<br>  Will cleave together, bound and free,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As brethren should, being twain and one."<br>  But ere they parted thence there came <br>  A creature withered as with flame,<br>  A dwarf mismade in nature's shame,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between them and the sun.<br>  <br>  And riding fleet as fire may glide<br>  He found the dead lie side by side,<br>  And wailed and rent his hair and cried,<br>  "Who hath done this deed?"  And Balen eyed<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing loathfully, and said,<br>  "The knight I slew, who found him fain<br>  And keen to slay me: seeing him slain,<br>  The maid I sought to save in vain,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-stricken, here lies dead.<br>  <br>  "Sore grief was mine to see her die,<br>  And for her true faith's sake shall I<br>  Love, and with love of heart more high,<br>  All women better till I die."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas," the dwarf said, "ill for thee<br>  In evil hour this deed was done:<br>  For now the quest shall be begun<br>  Against thee, from the dawning sun<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the sunset sea.<br>  <br>  "From shore to mountain, dawn to night,<br>  The kinsfolk of this great dead knight<br>  Will chase thee to thy death."  A light<br>  Of swift blithe scorn flashed answer bright<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fire from Balen's eye.  "For that,<br>  Small fear shall fret my heart," quoth he:<br>  "But that my lord the king should be<br>  For this dead man's sake wroth with me,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weep might it well thereat."<br>  <br>  Then murmuring passed the dwarf away,<br>  And toward the knights in fair array<br>  Came riding eastward up the way <br>  From where the flower-soft lowlands lay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A king whose name the sweet south-west<br>  Held high in honour, and the land<br>  That bowed beneath his gentle hand<br>  Wore on its wild bright northern strand<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tintagel for a crest.<br>  <br>  And Balen hailed with homage due<br>  King Mark of Cornwall, when he knew<br>  The pennon that before him flew:<br>  And for those lovers dead and true<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king made moan to hear their doom;<br>  And for their sorrow's sake he sware<br>  To seek in all the marches there<br>  The church that man might find most fair<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And build therein their tomb.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V<br>  <br>  As thought from thought takes wing and flies,<br>  As month on month with sunlit eyes<br>  Tramples and triumphs in its rise,<br>  As wave smites wave to death and dies,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So chance on hurtling chance like steel<br>  Strikes, flashes, and is quenched, ere fear<br>  Can whisper hope, or hope can hear,<br>  If sorrow or joy be far or near<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For time to hurt or heal.<br>  <br>  Swift as a shadow and strange as light<br>  That cleaves in twain the shadow of night<br>  Before the wide-winged word takes flight<br>  That thunder speaks to depth and height<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quells the quiet hour with sound,<br>  That came before King Mark and stood<br>  Between the moorside and the wood<br>  The man whose word God's will made good,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor guile was in it found.<br>  <br>  And Merlin said to Balen: "Lo,<br>  Thou hast wrought thyself a grievous woe<br>  To let this lady die, and know<br>  Thou mightst have stayed her deadly blow."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Balen answered him and said,<br>  "Nay, by my truth to faith, not I,<br>  So fiercely fain she was to die;<br>  Ere well her sword had flashed on high,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-slain she lay there dead."<br>  <br>  Again and sadly Merlin spake:<br>  "My heart is wrung for this deed's sake,<br>  To know thee therefore doomed to take <br>  Upon thine hand a curse, and make<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three kingdoms pine through twelve years' change,<br>  In want and woe: for thou shalt smite<br>  The man most noble and truest knight <br>  That looks upon the live world's light<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dolorous stroke and strange.<br>  <br>  "And not till years shall round their goal<br>  May this man's wound thou hast given be whole."<br>  And Balen, stricken through the soul<br>  By dark-winged words of doom and dole,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made answer: "If I wist it were<br>  No lie but sooth thou sayest of me,<br>  Then even to make a liar of thee<br>  Would I too slay myself, and see<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How death bids dead men fare."<br>  <br>  And Merlin took his leave and passed<br>  And was not: and the shadow as fast<br>  Went with him that his word had cast,<br>  Too fleet for thought thereof to last:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there those brethren bade King Mark<br>  Farewell: but fain would Mark have known<br>  The strong knight's name who had overthrown<br>  The pride of Launceor, when it shone<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright as it now lay dark.<br>  <br>  And Balan for his brother spake,<br>  Saying: "Sir, albeit him list not break<br>  The seal of secret time, nor shake<br>  Night off him ere his morning wake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By these two swords he is girt withal<br>  May men that praise him, knights and lords,<br>  Call him the knight that bears two swords,<br>  And all the praise his fame accords<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make answer when they call."<br>  <br>  So parted they toward eventide;<br>  And tender twilight, heavy-eyed,<br>  Saw deep down glimmering woodlands ride<br>  Balen and Balan side by side,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till where the leaves grew dense and dim<br>  Again they spied from far draw near<br>  The presence of the sacred seer,<br>  But so disguised and strange of cheer <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seeing they knew not him.<br>  <br>  "Now whither ride ye," Merlin said,<br>  "Through shadows that the sun strikes red,<br>  Ere night be born or day be dead?"<br>  But they, for doubt half touched with dread,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would say not where their goal might lie.<br>  "And thou," said Balen, "what art thou,<br>  To walk with shrouded eye and brow?"<br>  He said: "Me lists not show thee now<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By name what man am I."<br>  <br>  "Ill seen is this of thee," said they,<br>  "That thou art true in word and way<br>  Nor fain to fear the face of day,<br>  Who wilt not as a true man say<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name it shames not him to bear."<br>  He answered: "Be it or be it not so,<br>  Yet why ye ride this way I know,<br>  To meet King Ryons as a foe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how your hope shall fare.<br>  <br>  "Well, if ye hearken toward my rede,<br>  Ill, if ye hear not, shall ye speed."<br>  "Ah, now," they cried, "thou art ours at need:<br>  What Merlin saith we are fain to heed."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great worship shall ye win," said he,<br>  "And look that ye do knightly now,<br>  For great shall be your need, I trow."<br>  And Balen smiled: "By knighthood's vow,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best we may will we."<br>  <br>  Then Merlin bade them turn and take<br>  Rest, for their good steeds' weary sake,<br>  Between the highway and the brake,<br>  Till starry midnight bade them wake:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then "Rise," he said, "the king is nigh,<br>  Who hath stolen from all his host away<br>  With threescore horse in armed array,<br>  The goodliest knights that bear his sway<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold his kingdom high.<br>  <br>  "And twenty ride of them before<br>  To bear his errand, ere the door<br>  Turn of the night, sealed fast no more,<br>  And sundawn bid the stars wax hoar;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For by the starshine of to-night<br>  He seeks a leman where she waits<br>  His coming, dark and swift as fate's,<br>  And hearkens toward the unopening gates<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That yield not him to sight."<br>  <br>  Then through the glimmering gloom around<br>  A shadowy sense of light and sound<br>  Made, ere the proof thereof were found,<br>  The brave blithe hearts within them bound,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Where," quoth Balen, "rides the king?"<br>  But softer spake the seer: "Abide,<br>  Till hither toward your spears he ride,<br>  Where all the narrowing woodland side<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows dense with boughs that cling."<br>  <br>  There in that straitening way they met<br>  The wild Welsh host against them set,<br>  And smote their strong king down, ere yet<br>  His hurrying horde of spears might get <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce vantage of them.  Then the fight<br>  Grew great and joyous as it grew,<br>  For left and right those brethren slew,<br>  Till all the lawn waxed red with dew<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More deep than dews of night.<br>  <br>  And ere the full fierce tale was read<br>  Full forty lay before them dead,<br>  And fast the hurtling remnant fled<br>  And wist not whither fear had led:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toward the king they went again,<br>  And would have slain him: but he bowed<br>  Before them, crying in fear aloud<br>  For grace they gave him, seeing the proud<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild king brought lowest of men.<br>  <br>  And ere the wildwood leaves were stirred<br>  With song or wing of wakening bird,<br>  In Camelot was Merlin's word<br>  With joy in joyous wonder heard<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That told of Arthur's bitterest foe<br>  Diskingdomed and discomfited.<br>  "By whom?" the high king smiled and said.<br>  He answered: "Ere the dawn wax red,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow bids you know.<br>  <br>  "Two knights whose heart and hope are one<br>  And fain to win your grace have done<br>  This work whereby if grace be won<br>  Their hearts shall hail the enkindling sun<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy more keen and deep than day."<br>  And ere the sundawn drank the dew<br>  Those brethren with their prisoner drew<br>  To the outer guard they gave him to<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passed again away.<br>  <br>  And Arthur came as toward his guest<br>  To greet his foe, and bade him rest<br>  As one returned from nobler quest<br>  And welcome from the stormbright west,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by what chance he fain would hear.<br>  "The chance was hard and strange, sir king,"<br>  Quoth Ryons, bowed in thanksgiving.<br>  "Who won you?" Arthur said: "the thing<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is worth a warrior's ear."<br>  <br>  The wild king flushed with pride and shame,<br>  Answering: "I know not either name<br>  Of those that there against us came<br>  And withered all our strength like flame:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight that bears two swords is one,<br>  And one his brother: not on earth<br>  May men meet men of knightlier worth<br>  Nor mightier born of mortal birth<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hail the sovereign sun."<br>  <br>  And Arthur said: "I know them not;<br>  But much am I for this, God wot,<br>  Beholden to them: Launcelot<br>  Nor Tristram, when the war waxed hot<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the marches east and west,<br>  Wrought ever nobler work than this."<br>  "Ah," Merlin said, "sore pity it is <br>  And strange mischance of doom, I wis,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That death should mar their quest.<br>  <br>  "Balen, the perfect knight that won<br>  The sword whose name is malison,<br>  And made his deed his doom, is one:<br>  Nor hath his brother Balan done<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less royal service: not on earth<br>  Lives there a nobler knight, more strong<br>  Of soul to win men's praise in song,<br>  Albeit the light abide not long<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lightened round his birth.<br>  <br>  "Yea, and of all sad things I know<br>  The heaviest and the highest in woe<br>  Is this, the doom whose date brings low<br>  Too soon in timeless overthrow<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A head so high, a hope so sure.<br>  The greatest moan for any knight <br>  That ever won fair fame in fight<br>  Shall be for Balen, seeing his might<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must now not long endure."<br>  <br>  "Alas," King Arthur said, "he hath shown<br>  Such love to me-ward that the moan <br>  Made of him should be mine alone<br>  Above all other, knowing it known<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ill deserved it of him."  "Nay,"<br>  Said Merlin, "he shall do for you<br>  Much more, when time shall be anew,<br>  Than time hath given him chance to do<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hope may think to say.<br>  <br>  "But now must be your powers purveyed<br>  To meet, ere noon of morn be made<br>  To-morrow, all the host arrayed<br>  Of this wild foe's wild brother, laid<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around against you: see to it well,<br>  For now I part from you."  And soon,<br>  When sundawn slew the withering moon,<br>  Two hosts were met to win the boon<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose tale is death's to tell.<br>  <br>  A lordly tale of knights and lords<br>  For death to tell by count of swords<br>  When war's wild harp in all its chords<br>  Rang royal triumph, and the hordes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hurtling foemen rocked and reeled<br>  As waves wind-thwarted on the sea,<br>  Was told of all that there might be,<br>  Till scarce might battle hear or see<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortune of the field.<br>  <br>  And many a knight won fame that day<br>  When even the serpent soul of Kay<br>  Was kindled toward the fiery play<br>  As might a lion's be for prey,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And won him fame that might not die<br>  With passing of his rancorous breath<br>  But clung about his life and death<br>  As fire that speaks in cloud, and saith<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strong men hear and fly.<br>  <br>  And glorious works were Arthur's there,<br>  That lit the battle-darkened air:<br>  But when they saw before them fare<br>  Like stars of storm the knight that bare<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two swords about him girt for fray,<br>  Balen, and Balan with him, then<br>  Strong wonder smote the souls of men <br>  If heaven's own host or hell's deep den<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had sent them forth to slay.<br>  <br>  So keen they rode across the fight,<br>  So sharp they smote to left and right,<br>  And made of hurtling darkness light<br>  With lightning of their swords, till flight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fear before them flew like flame,<br>  That Arthur's self had never known,<br>  He said, since first his blast was blown,<br>  Such lords of war as these alone<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That whence he knew not came.<br>  <br>  But while the fire of war waxed hot <br>  The wild king hearkened, hearing not,<br>  Through storm of spears and arrow-shot,<br>  For succour toward him from King Lot<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all his host of sea-born men,<br>  Strong as the strong storm-baffling bird<br>  Whose cry round Orkney's headlands heard<br>  Is as the sea's own sovereign word<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mocks our mortal ken.<br>  <br>  For Merlin's craft of prophecy,<br>  Who wist that one of twain must die,<br>  Put might in him to say thereby<br>  Which head should lose its crown, and lie<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stricken, though loth he were to know<br>  That either life should wane and fail;<br>  Yet most might Arthur's love avail,<br>  And still with subtly tempered tale<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wile held fast the foe.<br>  <br>  With woven words of magic might<br>  Wherein the subtle shadow and light<br>  Changed hope and fear till fear took flight,<br>  He stayed King Lot's fierce lust of fight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till all the wild Welsh war was driven<br>  As foam before the wind that wakes<br>  With the all-awakening sun, and breaks<br>  Strong ships that rue the mirth it makes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When grace to slay is given.<br>  <br>  And ever hotter lit and higher,<br>  As fire that meets encountering fire,<br>  Waxed in King Lot his keen desire<br>  To bid revenge within him tire<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Arthur's ravaged fame and life:<br>  Across the waves of war between <br>  Floated and flashed, unseen and seen,<br>  The lustrous likeness of the queen<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom shame had sealed his wife.<br>  <br>  But when the woful word was brought<br>  That while he tarried, doubting nought,<br>  The hope was lost whose goal he sought<br>  And all the fight he yearned for fought,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart was rent for grief and shame,<br>  And half his hope was set on flight<br>  Till word was given him of a knight<br>  Who said: "They are weary and worn with fight.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we more fresh than flame."<br>  <br>  And bright and dark as night and day<br>  Ere either find the unopening way<br>  Clear, and forego the unaltering sway,<br>  The sad king's face shone, frowning: "Yea,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would that every knight of mine<br>  Would do his part as I shall do,"<br>  He said, "till death or life anew<br>  Shall judge between us as is due<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wiser doom than thine."<br>  <br>  Then thundered all the awakening field<br>  With crash of hosts that clashed and reeled,<br>  Banner to banner, shield to shield,<br>  And spear to splintering spear-shaft, steeled<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As heart against high heart of man,<br>  As hope against high hope of knight<br>  To pluck the crest and crown of fight<br>  From war's clenched hand by storm's wild light,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For blessing given or ban.<br>  <br>  All hearts of hearkening men that heard<br>  The ban twin-born with blessing, stirred<br>  Like springtide waters, knew the word<br>  Whereby the steeds of storm are spurred<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ravenous rapture to destroy,<br>  And laughed for love of battle, pierced<br>  With passion of tempestuous thirst<br>  And hungering hope to assuage it first<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With draughts of stormy joy.<br>  <br>  But sheer ahead of the iron tide<br>  That rocked and roared from side to side<br>  Rode as the lightning's lord might ride<br>  King Lot, whose heart was set to abide<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All peril of the raging hour,<br>  And all his host of warriors born<br>  Where lands by warring seas are worn<br>  Was only by his hands upborne<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gave them pride and power.<br>  <br>  But as the sea's hand smites the shore<br>  And shatters all the strengths that bore<br>  The ravage earth may bear no more,<br>  So smote the hand of Pellinore<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charging, a knight of Arthur's chief,<br>  And clove his strong steed's neck in twain,<br>  And smote him sheer through brow and brain,<br>  Falling: and there King Lot lay slain,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knew not wrath or grief.<br>  <br>  And all the host of Orkney fled,<br>  And many a mother's son lay dead:<br>  But when they raised the stricken head<br>  Whence pride and power and shame were fled<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rage and anguish now cast out,<br>  And bore it toward a kingly tomb,<br>  The wife whose love had wrought his doom<br>  Came thither, fair as morning's bloom<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dark as twilight's doubt.<br>  <br>  And there her four strong sons and his,<br>  Gawain and Gareth, Gaherys<br>  And Agravain, whose sword's sharp kiss<br>  With sound of hell's own serpent's hiss<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should one day turn her life to death,<br>  Stood mourning with her: but by these<br>  Seeing Mordred as a seer that sees,<br>  Anguish of terror bent her knees<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And caught her shuddering breath.<br>  <br>  The splendour of her sovereign eyes<br>  Flashed darkness deeper than the skies<br>  Feel or fear when the sunset dies<br>  On his that felt as midnight rise<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their doom upon them, there undone<br>  By faith in fear ere thought could yield<br>  A shadowy sense of days revealed,<br>  The ravin of the final field,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror of their son.<br>  <br>  For Arthur's, as they caught the light<br>  That sought and durst not seek his sight,<br>  Darkened, and all his spirit's might<br>  Withered within him even as night<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withers when sunrise thrills the sea.<br>  But Mordred's lightened as with fire<br>  That smote his mother and his sire<br>  With darkling doom and deep desire<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bade its darkness be.<br>  <br>  And heavier on their hearts the weight<br>  Sank of the fear that brings forth fate,<br>  With all the grief and love and hate<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That turn to fire men's days on earth.<br>  And glorious was the funeral made,<br>  And dark the deepening dread that swayed<br>  Their darkening souls whose light grew shade<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sense of death in birth.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI<br>  <br>  In autumn, when the wind and sea<br>  Rejoice to live and laugh to be,<br>  And scarce the blast that curbs the tree<br>  And bids before it quail and flee<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery foliage, where its brand<br>  Is radiant as the seal of spring,<br>  Sounds less delight, and waves a wing<br>  Less lustrous, life's loud thanksgiving<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puts life in sea and land.<br>  <br>  High hope in Balen's heart alight<br>  Laughed, as from all that clamorous fight<br>  He passed and sought not Arthur's sight,<br>  Who fain had found his kingliest knight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made amend for Balen's wrong.<br>  But Merlin gave his soul to see<br>  Fate, rising as a shoreward sea,<br>  And all the sorrow that should be<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere hope or fear thought long.<br>  <br>  "O where are they whose hands upbore<br>  My battle," Arthur said, "before<br>  The wild Welsh host's wide rage and roar?<br>  Balen and Balan, Pellinore<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are they?"  Merlin answered him:<br>  "Balen shall be not long away<br>  From sight of you, but night nor day<br>  Shall bring his brother back to say<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If life burn bright or dim."<br>  <br>  "Now, by my faith," said Arthur then,<br>  "Two marvellous knights are they, whose ken<br>  Toward battle makes the twain as ten,<br>  And Balen most of all born men<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passeth of prowess all I know<br>  Or ever found or sought to see: <br>  Would God he would abide with me <br>  To face the times foretold of thee<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the latter woe."<br>  <br>  For there had Merlin shown the king<br>  The doom that songs unborn should sing,<br>  The gifts that time should rise and bring<br>  Of blithe and bitter days to spring<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As weeds and flowers against the sun.<br>  And on the king for fear's sake fell<br>  Sickness, and sorrow deep as hell,<br>  Nor even might sleep bid fear farewell<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If grace to sleep were won.<br>  <br>  Down in a meadow green and still<br>  He bade the folk that wrought his will<br>  Pitch his pavilion, where the chill<br>  Soft night would let not rest fulfil<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart wherein dark fears lay deep.<br>  And sharp against his hearing cast<br>  Came a sound as of horsehoofs fast<br>  Passing, that ere their sound were past<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aroused him as from sleep.<br>  <br>  And forth he looked along the grass<br>  And saw before his portal pass<br>  A knight that wailed aloud, "Alas<br>  That life should find this dolorous pass<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And find no shield from doom and dole!"<br>  And hearing all his moan, "Abide,<br>  Fair sir," the king arose and cried,<br>  "And say what sorrow bids you ride<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sorrowful of soul."<br>  <br>  "My hurt may no man heal, God wot,<br>  And help of man may speed me not,"<br>  The sad knight said, "nor change my lot."<br>  And toward the castle of Melyot<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose towers arose a league away<br>  He passed forth sorrowing: and anon,<br>  Ere well the woful sight were gone,<br>  Came Balen down the meads that shone,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong, bright, and brave as day.<br>  <br>  And seeing the king there stand, the knight<br>  Drew rein before his face to alight<br>  In reverence made for love's sake bright<br>  With joy that set his face alight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As theirs who see, alive, above,<br>  The sovereign of their souls, whose name <br>  To them is even as love's own flame<br>  To enkindle hope that heeds not fame<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knows no lord but love.<br>  <br>  And Arthur smiled on him, and said,<br>  "Right welcome be thou: by my head,<br>  I would not wish me better sped.<br>  For even but now there came and fled<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me like a cloud that flies<br>  A knight that made most heavy cheer,<br>  I know not wherefore; nor may fear<br>  Or pity give my heart to hear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lighten on mine eyes.<br>  <br>  "But even for fear's and pity's sake<br>  Fain were I thou shouldst overtake<br>  And fetch again this knight that spake<br>  No word of answering grace to make<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reply to mine that hailed him: thou,<br>  By force or by goodwill, shalt bring<br>  His face before me."  "Yea, my king,"<br>  Quoth Balen, "and a greater thing<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were less than is my vow.<br>  <br>  "I would the task required and heard<br>  Were heavier than your sovereign word<br>  Hath laid on me:" and thence he spurred<br>  Elate at heart as youth, and stirred<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hope as blithe as fires a boy:<br>  And many a mile he rode, and found<br>  Far in a forest's glimmering bound<br>  The man he sought afar around<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seeing took fire for joy.<br>  <br>  And with him went a maiden, fair<br>  As flowers aflush with April air.<br>  And Balen bade him turn him there<br>  To tell the king what woes they were<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bowed him down so sore: and he<br>  Made woful answer: "This should do<br>  Great scathe to me, with nought for you<br>  Of help that hope might hearken to <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For boot that may not be."<br>  <br>  And Balen answered: "I were loth<br>  To fight as one perforce made wroth<br>  With one that owes by knighthood's oath<br>  One love, one service, and one troth<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With me to him whose gracious hand<br>  Holds fast the helm of knighthood here<br>  Whereby man's hope and heart may steer:<br>  I pray you let not sorrow or fear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against his bidding stand."<br>  <br>  The strange knight gazed on him, and spake:<br>  "Will you, for Arthur's royal sake,<br>  Be warrant for me that I take<br>  No scathe from strife that man may make?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then will I go with you."  And he<br>  Made joyous answer: "Yea, for I <br>  Will be your warrant or will die."<br>  And thence they rode with hearts as high<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As men's that search the sea.<br>  <br>  And as by noon's large light the twain<br>  Before the tented hall drew rein,<br>  Suddenly fell the strange knight, slain<br>  By one that came and went again<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none might see him; but his spear<br>  Clove through the body, swift as fire,<br>  The man whose doom, forefelt as dire,<br>  Had darkened all his life's desire,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one that death held dear.<br>  <br>  And dying he turned his face and said,<br>  "Lo now thy warrant that my head<br>  Should fall not, following forth where led<br>  A knight whose pledge hath left me dead.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This darkling manslayer hath to name <br>  Garlon: take thou my goodlier steed,<br>  Seeing thine is less of strength and speed,<br>  And ride, if thou be knight indeed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even thither whence we came.<br>  <br>  "And as the maiden's fair behest<br>  Shall bid you follow on my quest,<br>  Follow: and when God's will sees best,<br>  Revenge my death, and let me rest<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one that lived and died a knight,<br>  Unstained of shame alive or dead."<br>  And Balen, wrung with sorrow, said,<br>  "That shall I do: my hand and head<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pledge to do you right."<br>  <br>  And thence with sorrowing heart and cheer<br>  He rode, in grief that cast out fear<br>  Lest death in darkness yet were near,<br>  And bore the truncheon of the spear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith the woful knight lay slain<br>  To her with whom he rode, and she <br>  Still bare it with her, fain to see<br>  What righteous doom of God's might be<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkling manslayer's bane.<br>  <br>  And down a dim deep woodland way<br>  They rode between the boughs asway<br>  With flickering winds whose flash and play<br>  Made sunlight sunnier where the day<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughed, leapt, and fluttered like a bird<br>  Caught in a light loose leafy net<br>  That earth for amorous heaven had set<br>  To hold and see the sundawn yet<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hear what morning heard.<br>  <br>  There in the sweet soft shifting light<br>  Across their passage rode a knight<br>  Flushed hot from hunting as from fight, <br>  And seeing the sorrow-stricken sight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made question of them why they rode<br>  As mourners sick at heart and sad,<br>  When all alive about them bade<br>  Sweet earth for heaven's sweet sake be glad<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As heaven for earth's love glowed.<br>  <br>  "Me lists not tell you,"  Balen said.<br>  The strange knight's face grew keen and red;<br>  "Now, might my hand but keep my head,<br>  Even here should one of twain lie dead<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were he no better armed than I."<br>  And Balen spake with smiling speed,<br>  Where scorn and courtesy kept heed<br>  Of either: "That should little need:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not here shall either die."<br>  <br>  And all the cause he told him through<br>  As one that feared not though he knew<br>  All: and the strange knight spake anew,<br>  Saying: "I will part no more from you<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While life shall last me."  So they went<br>  Where he might arm himself to ride,<br>  And rode across wild ways and wide<br>  To where against a churchyard side<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hermit's harbour leant.<br>  <br>  And there against them riding came<br>  Fleet as the lightning's laugh and flame <br>  The invisible evil, even the same<br>  They sought and might not curse by name<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hell's foul child on earth set free,<br>  And smote the strange knight through, and fled,<br>  And left the mourners by the dead.<br>  "Alas, again," Sir Balen said,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This wrong he hath done to me."<br>  <br>  And there they laid their dead to sleep<br>  Royally, lying where wild winds keep<br>  Keen watch and wail more soft and deep<br>  Than where men's choirs bid music weep<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And song like incense heave and swell.<br>  And forth again they rode, and found<br>  Before them, dire in sight and sound,<br>  A castle girt about and bound<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sorrow like a spell.<br>  <br>  Above it seemed the sun at noon<br>  Sad as a wintry withering moon<br>  That shudders while the waste wind's tune<br>  Craves ever none may guess what boon,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all may know the boon for dire.<br>  And evening on its darkness fell<br>  More dark than very death's farewell,<br>  And night about it hung like hell,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose fume the dawn made fire.<br>  <br>  And Balen lighted down and passed<br>  Within the gateway, whence no blast<br>  Rang as the sheer portcullis, cast<br>  Suddenly down, fell, and made fast<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate behind him, whence he spied<br>  A sudden rage of men without<br>  And ravin of a murderous rout<br>  That girt the maiden hard about <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With death on either side.<br>  <br>  And seeing that shame and peril, fear<br>  Bade wrath and grief awake and hear<br>  What shame should say in fame's wide ear<br>  If she, by sorrow sealed more dear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than joy might make her, so should die:<br>  And up the tower's curled stair he sprang<br>  As one that flies death's deadliest fang,<br>  And leapt right out amid their gang<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fire from heaven on high.<br>  <br>  And they thereunder seeing the knight<br>  Unhurt among their press alight<br>  And bare his sword for chance of fight<br>  Stood from him, loth to strive or smite,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bade him hear their woful word,<br>  That not the maiden's death they sought;<br>  But there through years too dire for thought<br>  Had lain their lady stricken, and nought<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might heal her: and he heard.<br>  <br>  For there a maiden clean and whole<br>  In virgin body and virgin soul,<br>  Whose name was writ on royal roll,<br>  That would but stain a silver bowl<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With offering of her stainless blood,<br>  Therewith might heal her: so they stayed <br>  For hope's sad sake each blameless maid<br>  There journeying in that dolorous shade<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose bloom was bright in bud.<br>  <br>  No hurt nor harm to her it were<br>  If she should yield a sister there<br>  Some tribute of her blood, and fare<br>  Forth with this joy at heart to bear,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all unhurt and unafraid<br>  This grace she had here by God's grace wrought.<br>  And kindling all with kindly thought<br>  And love that saw save love's self nought,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone, smiled, and spake the maid.<br>  <br>  "Good knight of mine, good will have I<br>  To help this healing though I die."<br>  "Nay," Balen said, "but love may try<br>  What help in living love may lie.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--I will not lose the life of her<br>  While my life lasteth."  So she gave <br>  The tribute love was fain to crave,<br>  But might not heal though fain to save,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were God's grace helpfuller.<br>  <br>  Another maid in later Mays<br>  Won with her life that woful praise,<br>  And died.  But they, when surging day's <br>  Deep tide fulfilled the dawn's wide ways,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode forth, and found by day or night<br>  No chance to cross their wayfaring <br>  Till when they saw the fourth day spring<br>  A knight's hall gave them harbouring <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich as a king's house might.<br>  <br>  And while they sat at meat and spake<br>  Words bright and kind as grace might make<br>  Sweet for true knighthood's kindly sake,<br>  They heard a cry beside them break<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The still-souled joy of blameless rest.<br>  "What noise is this?" quoth Balen.  "Nay,"<br>  His knightly host made answer, "may<br>  Our grief not grieve you though I say<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How here I dwell unblest.<br>  <br>  "Not many a day has lived and died<br>  Since at a tournay late I tried<br>  My strength to smite and turn and ride<br>  Against a knight of kinglike pride,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Pellam's brother: twice I smote<br>  The splendour of his strength to dust:<br>  And he, fulfilled of hate's fierce lust,<br>  Swore vengeance, pledged for hell to trust,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keen as hell's wide throat.<br>  <br>  "Invisible as the spirit of night<br>  That heaven and earth in depth and height<br>  May see not by the mild moon's light<br>  Nor even when stars would grant them sight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walks and slays as plague's blind breath<br>  Slays: and my son, whose anguish here<br>  Makes moan perforce that mars our cheer,<br>  He wounded, even ere love might fear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hate were strong as death.<br>  <br>  "Nor may my son be whole till he<br>  Whose stroke through him hath stricken me<br>  Shall give again his blood to be <br>  Our healing: yet may no man see<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This felon, clothed with darkness round<br>  And keen as lightning's life."  Thereon<br>  Spake Balen, and his presence shone<br>  Even as the sun's when stars are gone<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That hear dawn's trumpet sound.<br>  <br>  "That knight I know: two knights of mine,<br>  Two comrades, sealed by faith's bright sign,<br>  Whose eyes as ours that live should shine,<br>  And drink the golden sunlight's wine<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With joy's thanksgiving that they live,<br>  He hath slain in even the same blind wise:<br>  Were all wide wealth beneath the skies<br>  Mine, might I meet him, eyes on eyes,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All would I laugh to give."<br>  <br>  His host made answer, and his gaze<br>  Grew bright with trust as dawn's moist maze<br>  With fire: "Within these twenty days,<br>  King Pellam, lord of Lystenayse,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holds feast through all this country cried,<br>  And there before the knightly king<br>  May no knight come except he bring<br>  For witness of his wayfaring<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His paramour or bride.<br>  <br>  "And there that day, so soon to shine,<br>  This knight, your felon foe and mine,<br>  Shall show, full-flushed with bloodred wine,<br>  The fierce false face whereon we pine<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wreak the wrong he hath wrought us, bare<br>  As shame should see and brand it."  "Then,"<br>  Said Balen, "shall he give again<br>  His blood to heal your son, and men<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall see death blind him there."<br>  <br>  "Forth will we fare to-morrow," said<br>  His host: and forth, as sunrise led,<br>  They rode; and fifteen days were fled<br>  Ere toward their goal their steeds had sped.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there alighting might they find<br>  For Balen's host no place to rest,<br>  Who came without a gentler guest<br>  Beside him: and that household's hest<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade leave his sword behind.<br>  <br>  "Nay," Balen said, "that do I not:<br>  My country's custom stands, God wot,<br>  That none whose lot is knighthood's lot,<br>  To ride where chance as fire is hot<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hope or promise given of fight, <br>  Shall fail to keep, for knighthood's part,<br>  His weapon with him as his heart;<br>  And as I came will I depart,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hold herein my right."<br>  <br>  Then gat he leave to wear his sword<br>  Beside the strange king's festal board<br>  Where feasted many a knight and lord<br>  In seemliness of fair accord:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Balen asked of one beside,<br>  "Is there not in this court, if fame<br>  Keep faith, a knight that hath to name<br>  Garlon?" and saying that word of shame,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scanned that place of pride.<br>  <br>  "Yonder he goeth against the light,<br>  He with the face as swart as night,"<br>  Quoth the other: "but he rides to fight<br>  Hid round by charms from all men's sight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a noble knight he hath slain,<br>  Being wrapt in darkness deep as hell<br>  And silence dark as shame."  "Ah, well,"<br>  Said Balen, "is that he? the spell<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be the sorcerer's bane."<br>  <br>  Then Balen gazed upon him long,<br>  And thought, "If here I wreak my wrong,<br>  Alive I may not scape, so strong<br>  The felon's friends about him throng;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I leave him here alive,<br>  This chance perchance may life not give<br>  Again: much evil, if he live,<br>  He needs must do, should fear forgive<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wrongs bid strike and strive."<br>  <br>  And Garlon, seeing how Balen's eye<br>  Dwelt on him as his heart waxed high<br>  With joy in wrath to see him nigh,<br>  Rose wolf-like with a wolfish cry<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crossed and smote him on the face,<br>  Saying, "Knight, what wouldst thou with me?  Eat,<br>  For shame, and gaze not: eat thy meat:<br>  Do that thou art come for: stands thy seat<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next ours of royal race?"<br>  <br>  "Well hast thou said: thy rede rings true;<br>  That which I came for will I do,"<br>  Quoth Balen: forth his fleet sword flew,<br>  And clove the head of Garlon through<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean to the shoulders.  Then he cried<br>  Loud to his lady,  "Give me here<br>  The truncheon of the shameful spear<br>  Wherewith he slew your knight, when fear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade hate in darkness ride."<br>  <br>  And gladly, bright with grief made glad, <br>  She gave the truncheon as he bade,<br>  For still she bare it with her, sad<br>  And strong in hopeless hope she had,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all dark days of thwarting fear,<br>  To see if doom should fall aright<br>  And as God's fire-fraught thunder smite<br>  That head, clothed round with hell-faced night,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare now before her here.<br>  <br>  And Balen smote therewith the dead<br>  Dark felon's body through, and said<br>  Aloud, "With even this truncheon, red<br>  With baser blood than brave men bled<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom in thy shameful hand it slew,<br>  Thou hast slain a nobler knight, and now<br>  It clings and cleaves thy body: thou<br>  Shalt cleave again no brave man's brow,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though hell would aid anew."<br>  <br>  And toward his host he turned and spake;<br>  "Now for your son's long-suffering sake<br>  Blood ye may fetch enough, and take<br>  Wherewith to heal his hurt, and make<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death warm as life."  Then rose a cry<br>  Loud as the wind's when stormy spring<br>  Makes all the woodland rage and ring:<br>  "Thou hast slain my brother," said the king,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And here with him shalt die."<br>  <br>  "Ay?" Balen laughed him answer.  "Well,<br>  Do it then thyself."  And the answer fell<br>  Fierce as a blast of hate from hell,<br>  "No man of mine that with me dwell<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall strike at thee but I their lord<br>  For love of this my brother slain."<br>  And Pellam caught and grasped amain<br>  A grim great weapon, fierce and fain<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To feed his hungering sword.<br>  <br>  And eagerly he smote, and sped<br>  Not well: for Balen's blade, yet red<br>  With lifeblood of the murderous dead,<br>  Between the swordstroke and his head<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone, and the strength of the eager stroke<br>  Shore it in sunder: then the knight,<br>  Naked and weaponless for fight,<br>  Ran seeking him a sword to smite<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hope within him woke.<br>  <br>  And so their flight for deathward fast <br>  From chamber forth to chamber passed<br>  Where lay no weapon, till the last<br>  Whose doors made way for Balen cast<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon him as a sudden spell<br>  Wonder that even as lightning leapt<br>  Across his heart and eyes, and swept<br>  As storm across his soul that kept<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild watch, and watched not well.<br>  <br>  For there the deed he did, being near<br>  Death's danger, breathless as the deer<br>  Driven hard to bay, but void of fear,<br>  Brought sorrow down for many a year<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On many a man in many a land.<br>  All glorious shone that chamber, bright<br>  As burns at sunrise heaven's own height:<br>  With cloth of gold the bed was dight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flamed on either hand.<br>  <br>  And one he saw within it lie: <br>  A table of all clear gold thereby<br>  Stood stately, fair as morning's eye,<br>  With four strong silver pillars, high<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And firm as faith and hope may be: <br>  And on it shone the gift he sought,<br>  A spear most marvellously wrought,<br>  That when his eye and handgrip caught<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small fear at heart had he.<br>  <br>  Right on King Pellam then, as fire<br>  Turns when the thwarting winds wax higher,<br>  He turned, and smote him down.  So dire<br>  The stroke was, when his heart's desire<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck, and had all its fill of hate,<br>  That as the king fell swooning down<br>  Fell the walls, rent from base to crown,<br>  Prone as prone seas that break and drown<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships fraught with doom for freight.<br>  <br>  And there for three days' silent space<br>  Balen and Pellam face to face<br>  Lay dead or deathlike, and the place <br>  Was death's blind kingdom, till the grace<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That God had given the sacred seer<br>  For counsel or for comfort led<br>  His Merlin thither, and he said,<br>  Standing between the quick and dead,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rise up, and rest not here."<br>  <br>  And Balen rose and set his eyes<br>  Against the seer's as one that tries<br>  His heart against the sea's and sky's <br>  And fears not if he lives or dies,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying, "I would have my damosel,<br>  Ere I fare forth, to fare with me."<br>  And sadly Merlin answered, "See<br>  Where now she lies; death knows if she<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall now fare ill or well.<br>  <br>  "And in this world we meet no more,<br>  Balen."  And Balen, sorrowing sore,<br>  Though fearless yet the heart he bore<br>  Beat toward the life that lay before,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rode forth through many a wild waste land<br>  Where men cried out against him, mad<br>  With grievous faith in fear that bade<br>  Their wrath make moan for doubt they had<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest hell had armed his hand.<br>  <br>  For in that chamber's wondrous shrine<br>  Was part of Christ's own blood, the wine<br>  Shed of the true triumphal vine<br>  Whose growth bids earth's deep darkness shine<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As heaven's deep light through the air and sea;<br>  That mystery toward our northern shore<br>  Arimathean Joseph bore<br>  For healing of our sins of yore,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grace even there might be.<br>  <br>  And with that spear there shrined apart<br>  Was Christ's side smitten to the heart.<br>  And fiercer than the lightning's dart<br>  The stroke was, and the deathlike smart<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith, nigh drained of blood and breath,<br>  The king lay stricken as one long dead:<br>  And Joseph's was the blood there shed,<br>  For near akin was he that bled,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near even as life to death.<br>  <br>  And therefore fell on all that land<br>  Sorrow: for still on either hand,<br>  As Balen rode alone and scanned<br>  Bright fields and cities built to stand<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till time should break them, dead men lay;<br>  And loud and long from all their folk<br>  Living, one cry that cursed him broke;<br>  Three countries had his dolorous stroke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slain, or should surely slay.<br>  <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII<br>  <br>  In winter, when the year burns low<br>  As fire wherein no firebrands glow,<br>  And winds dishevel as they blow<br>  The lovely stormy wings of snow,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearts of northern men burn bright<br>  With joy that mocks the joy of spring<br>  To hear all heaven's keen clarions ring<br>  Music that bids the spirit sing<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And day give thanks for night.<br>  <br>  Aloud and dark as hell or hate<br>  Round Balen's head the wind of fate<br>  Blew storm and cloud from death's wide gate:<br>  But joy as grief in him was great<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To face God's doom and live or die,<br>  Sorrowing for ill wrought unaware,<br>  Rejoicing in desire to dare<br>  All ill that innocence might bear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With changeless heart and eye.<br>  <br>  Yet passing fain he was when past<br>  Those lands and woes at length and last.<br>  Eight times, as thence he fared forth fast,<br>  Dawn rose and even was overcast <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With starry darkness dear as day,<br>  Before his venturous quest might meet<br>  Adventure, seeing within a sweet<br>  Green low-lying forest, hushed in heat,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tower that barred his way.<br>  <br>  Strong summer, dumb with rapture, bound<br>  With golden calm the woodlands round<br>  Wherethrough the knight forth faring found<br>  A knight that on the greenwood ground<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat mourning: fair he was to see,<br>  And moulded as for love or fight<br>  A maiden's dreams might frame her knight;<br>  But sad in joy's far-flowering sight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As grief's blind thrall might be.<br>  <br>  "God save you," Balen softly said,<br>  "What grief bows down your heart and head<br>  Thus, as one sorrowing for his dead?<br>  Tell me, if haply I may stead<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In aught your sorrow, that I may."<br>  "Sir knight," that other said, "thy word<br>  Makes my grief heavier that I heard."<br>  And pity and wonder inly stirred<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew Balen thence away.<br>  <br>  And so withdrawn with silent speed<br>  He saw the sad knight's stately steed,<br>  A war-horse meet for warrior's need,<br>  That none who passed might choose but heed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So strong he stood, so great, so fair,<br>  With eyes afire for flight or fight,<br>  A joy to look on, mild in might,<br>  And swift and keen and kind as light,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all as clear of care.<br>  <br>  And Balen, gazing on him, heard<br>  Again his master's woful word<br>  Sound sorrow through the calm unstirred<br>  By fluttering wind or flickering bird, <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus: "Ah, fair lady and faithless, why<br>  Break thy pledged faith to meet me? soon<br>  An hour beyond thy trothplight noon<br>  Shall strike my death-bell, and thy boon<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this, that here I die.<br>  <br>  "My curse for all thy gifts may be<br>  Heavier than death or night on thee;<br>  For now this sword thou gavest me<br>  Shall set me from thy bondage free."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the man had died self-slain,<br>  But Balen leapt on him and caught <br>  The blind fierce hand that fain had wrought<br>  Self-murder, stung with fire of thought,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rage makes anguish fain.<br>  <br>  Then, mad for thwarted grief, "Let go<br>  My hand," the fool of wrath and woe<br>  Cried, "or I slay thee."  Scarce the glow<br>  In Balen's cheek and eye might show,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dawn shows day while seas lie chill,<br>  He heard, though pity took not heed,<br>  But smiled and spake, "That shall not need:<br>  What man may do to bid you speed<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, so God speed me, will."<br>  <br>  And the other craved his name, beguiled<br>  By hope that made his madness mild.<br>  Again Sir Balen spake and smiled:<br>  "My name is Balen, called the Wild<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By knights whom kings and courts make tame,<br>  Because I ride alone afar<br>  And follow but my soul for star."<br>  "Ah, sir, I know the knight you are<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all your fiery fame.<br>  <br>  "The knight that bears two swords I know,<br>  Most praised of all men, friend and foe,<br>  For prowess of your hands, that show<br>  Dark war the way where balefires glow<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kindle glory like the dawn's."<br>  So spake the sorrowing knight, and stood<br>  As one whose heart fresh hope made good:<br>  And forth they rode by wold and wood<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the glimmering lawns.<br>  <br>  And Balen craved his name who rode<br>  Beside him, where the wild wood glowed<br>  With joy to feel how noontide flowed<br>  Through glade and glen and rough green road<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till earth grew joyful as the sea.<br>  "My name is Garnysshe of the Mount,<br>  A poor man's son of none account,"<br>  He said, "where springs of loftier fount<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh loud with pride to be.<br>  <br>  "But strength in weakness lives and stands<br>  As rocks that rise through shifting sands;<br>  And for the prowess of my hands<br>  One made me knight and gave me lands,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke Hermel, lord from far to near,<br>  Our prince; and she that loved me--she<br>  I love, and deemed she loved but me,<br>  His daughter, pledged her faith to be<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere now beside me here."<br>  <br>  And Balen, brief of speech as light<br>  Whose word, beheld of depth and height,<br>  Strikes silence through the stars of night,<br>  Spake, and his face as dawn's grew bright,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hope to help a happier man,<br>  "How far then lies she hence?"  "By this,"<br>  Her lover sighed and said, "I wis,<br>  Not six fleet miles the passage is,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straight as thought could span."<br>  <br>  So rode they swift and sure, and found<br>  A castle walled and dyked around:<br>  And Balen, as a warrior bound<br>  On search where hope might fear to sound<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the deeps of doubt,<br>  Made entrance through the guardless gate<br>  As life, while hope in life grows great,<br>  Makes way between the doors of fate<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That death may pass thereout.<br>  <br>  Through many a glorious chamber, wrought<br>  For all delight that love's own thought<br>  Might dream or dwell in, Balen sought<br>  And found of all he looked for nought,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For like a shining shell her bed<br>  Shone void and vacant of her: thence<br>  Through devious wonders bright and dense<br>  He passed and saw with shame-struck sense<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shame and faith lay dead.<br>  <br>  Down in a sweet small garden, fair<br>  With flowerful joy in the ardent air,<br>  He saw, and raged with loathing, where<br>  She lay with love-dishevelled hair<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a broad bright laurel tree<br>  And clasped in amorous arms a knight,<br>  The unloveliest that his scornful sight<br>  Had dwelt on yet; a shame the bright<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad noon might shrink to see.<br>  <br>  And thence in wrathful hope he turned,<br>  Hot as the heart within him burned,<br>  To meet the knight whose love, so spurned<br>  And spat on and made nought of, yearned<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreamed and hoped and lived in vain,<br>  And said, "I have found her sleeping fast,"<br>  And led him where the shadows cast<br>  From leaves wherethrough light winds ran past<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screened her from sun and rain.<br>  <br>  But Garnysshe, seeing, reeled as he stood <br>  Like a tree, kingliest of the wood,<br>  Half hewn through: and the burning blood<br>  Through lips and nostrils burst aflood:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gathering back his rage and might<br>  As broken breakers rally and roar<br>  The loud wind down that drives off shore,<br>  He smote their heads off: there no more<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their life might shame the light.<br>  <br>  Then turned he back toward Balen, mad<br>  With grief, and said, "The grief I had <br>  Was nought: ere this my life was glad:<br>  Thou hast done this deed: I was but sad<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fearful how my hope might fare:<br>  I had lived my sorrow down, hadst thou<br>  Not shown me what I saw but now."<br>  The sorrow and scorn on Balen's brow<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bade silence curb him there.<br>  <br>  And Balen answered: "What I did<br>  I did to hearten thee and bid<br>  Thy courage know that shame should rid<br>  A man's high heart of love that hid<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind shame within its core: God knows,<br>  I did, to set a bondman free,<br>  But as I would thou hadst done by me,<br>  That seeing what love must die to see<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's end might well be woe's."<br>  <br>  "Alas," the woful weakling said,<br>  "I have slain what most I loved: I have shed<br>  The blood most near my heart: the head<br>  Lies cold as earth, defiled and dead,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all my life was lighted by,<br>  That all my soul bowed down before,<br>  And now may bear with life no more:<br>  For now my sorrow that I bore<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is twofold, and I die."<br>  <br>  Then with his red wet sword he rove<br>  His breast in sunder, where it clove<br>  Life, and no pulse against it strove,<br>  So sure and strong the deep stroke drove<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deathward: and Balen, seeing him dead,<br>  Rode thence, lest folk would say he had slain<br>  Those three: and ere three days again<br>  Had seen the sun's might wax and wane,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far forth he had spurred and sped.<br>  <br>  And riding past a cross whereon<br>  Broad golden letters written shone,<br>  Saying, "No knight born may ride alone<br>  Forth toward this castle," and all the stone<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowed in the sun's glare even as though<br>  Blood stained it from the crucified<br>  Dead burden of one that there had died,<br>  An old hoar man he saw beside<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose face was wan as woe.<br>  <br>  "Balen the Wild," he said, "this way<br>  Thy way lies not: thou hast passed to-day<br>  Thy bands: but turn again, and stay<br>  Thy passage, while thy soul hath sway<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within thee, and through God's good power<br>  It will avail thee:" and anon<br>  His likeness as a cloud was gone,<br>  And Balen's heart within him shone<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear as the cloudless hour.<br>  <br>  Nor fate nor fear might overcast<br>  The soul now near its peace at last.<br>  Suddenly, thence as forth he past,<br>  A mighty and a deadly blast<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blown of a hunting-horn he heard,<br>  As when the chase hath nobly sped.<br>  "That blast is blown for me," he said,<br>  "The prize am I who am yet not dead,"<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled upon the word.<br>  <br>  As toward a royal hart's death rang<br>  That note, whence all the loud wood sang<br>  With winged and living sound that sprang<br>  Like fire, and keen as fire's own fang<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierced the sweet silence that it slew.<br>  But nought like death or strife was here:<br>  Fair semblance and most goodly cheer<br>  They made him, they whose troop drew near<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As death among them drew.<br>  <br>  A hundred ladies well arrayed<br>  And many a knight well weaponed made<br>  That kindly show of cheer: the glade<br>  Shone round them till its very shade<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightened and laughed from grove to lawn<br>  To hear and see them: so they brought<br>  Within a castle fair as thought<br>  Could dream that wizard hands had wrought<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guest among them drawn.<br>  <br>  All manner of glorious joy was there:<br>  Harping and dancing, loud and fair,<br>  And minstrelsy that made of air<br>  Fire, so like fire its raptures were.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the chief lady spake on high:<br>  "Knight with the two swords, one of two <br>  Must help you here or fall from you: <br>  For needs you now must have ado<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joust with one hereby.<br>  <br>  "A good knight guards an island here<br>  Against all swords that chance brings near,<br>  And there with stroke of sword and spear<br>  Must all for whom these halls make cheer<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight, and redeem or yield up life."<br>  "An evil custom," Balen said,<br>  "Is this, that none whom chance hath led<br>  Hither, if knighthood crown his head,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May pass unstirred to strife."<br>  <br>  "You shall not have ado to fight<br>  Here save against one only knight,"<br>  She said, and all her face grew bright<br>  As hell-fire, lit with hungry light<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wicked laughter touched with flame.<br>  "Well, since I shall thereto," said he, <br>  "I am ready at heart as death for me:<br>  Fain would I be where death should be<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life should lose its name.<br>  <br>  "But travelling men whose goal afar<br>  Shines as a cloud-constraining star<br>  Are often weary, and wearier are <br>  Their steeds that feel each fret and jar<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith the wild ways wound them: yet,<br>  Albeit my horse be weary, still<br>  My heart is nowise weary; will<br>  Sustains it even till death fulfil<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My trust upon him set."<br>  <br>  "Sir," said a knight thereby that stood,<br>  "Meseems your shield is now not good<br>  But worn with warrior work, nor could <br>  Sustain in strife the strokes it would:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A larger will I lend you." "Ay,<br>  Thereof I thank you," Balen said,<br>  Being single of heart as one that read<br>  No face aright whence faith had fled,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor dreamed that faith could fly.<br>  <br>  And so he took that shield unknown<br>  And left for treason's touch his own,<br>  And toward that island rode alone,<br>  Nor heard the blast against him blown<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound in the wind's and water's sound,<br>  But hearkening toward the stream's edge heard<br>  Nought save the soft stream's rippling word,<br>  Glad with the gladness of a bird,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sang to the air around.<br>  <br>  And there against the water-side<br>  He saw, fast moored to rock and ride,<br>  A fair great boat anear abide<br>  Like one that waits the turning tide,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein embarked his horse and he<br>  Passed over toward no kindly strand:<br>  And where they stood again on land<br>  There stood a maiden hard at hand<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who seeing them wept to see.<br>  <br>  And "O knight Balen," was her cry,<br>  "Why have ye left your own shield? why<br>  Come hither out of time to die?<br>  For had ye kept your shield, thereby<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye had yet been known, and died not here.<br>  Great pity it is of you this day<br>  As ever was of knight, or may<br>  Be ever, seeing in war's bright way<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise knows not Balen's peer."<br>  <br>  And Balen said, "Thou hast heard my name<br>  Right: it repenteth me, though shame<br>  May tax me not with base men's blame,<br>  That ever, hap what will, I came<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this country; yet, being come,<br>  For shame I may not turn again<br>  Now, that myself and nobler men<br>  May scorn me: now is more than then,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faith bids fear be dumb.<br>  <br>  "Be it life or death, my chance I take,<br>  Be it life's to build or death's to break:<br>  And fall what may, me lists not make<br>  Moan for sad life's or death's sad sake."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then looked he on his armour, glad<br>  And high of heart, and found it strong:<br>  And all his soul became a song<br>  And soared in prayer that soared not long,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the hope it had.<br>  <br>  Then saw he whence against him came<br>  A steed whose trappings shone like flame,<br>  And he that rode him showed the same<br>  Fierce colour, bright as fire or fame,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dark the visors were as night<br>  That hid from Balen Balan's face,<br>  And his from Balan: God's own grace<br>  Forsook them for a shadowy space<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where darkness cast out light.<br>  <br>  The two swords girt that Balen bare<br>  Gave Balan for a breath's while there<br>  Pause, wondering if indeed it were <br>  Balen his brother, bound to dare<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chance of that unhappy quest:<br>  But seeing not as he thought to see<br>  His shield, he deemed it was not he,<br>  And so, as fate bade sorrow be,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They laid their spears in rest.<br>  <br>  So mighty was the course they ran<br>  With spear to spear so great of span,<br>  Each fell back stricken, man by man,<br>  Horse by horse, borne down: so the ban<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wrought by doom against them wrought:<br>  But Balen by his falling steed<br>  Was bruised the sorer, being indeed<br>  Way-weary, like a rain-bruised reed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With travel ere he fought.<br>  <br>  And Balen rose again from swoon<br>  First, and went toward him: all too soon<br>  He too then rose, and the evil boon<br>  Of strength came back, and the evil tune<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of battle unnatural made again<br>  Mad music as for death's wide ear<br>  Listening and hungering toward the near<br>  Last sigh that life or death might hear<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last from dying men.<br>  <br>  Balan smote Balen first, and clove<br>  His lifted shield that rose and strove<br>  In vain against the stroke that drove<br>  Down: as the web that morning wove <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of glimmering pearl from spray to spray<br>  Dies when the strong sun strikes it, so<br>  Shrank the steel, tempered thrice to show<br>  Strength, as the mad might of the blow<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shore Balen's helm away.<br>  <br>  Then turning as a turning wave<br>  Against the land-wind, blind and brave<br>  In hope that dreams despair may save,<br>  With even the unhappy sword that gave<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gifts of fame and fate in one<br>  He smote his brother, and there had nigh<br>  Felled him: and while they breathed, his eye<br>  Glanced up, and saw beneath the sky<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sights fairer than the sun.<br>  <br>  The towers of all the castle there<br>  Stood full of ladies, blithe and fair<br>  As the earth beneath and the amorous air<br>  About them and above them were:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So toward the blind and fateful fight<br>  Again those brethren went, and sore<br>  Were all the strokes they smote and bore,<br>  And breathed again, and fell once more<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To battle in their sight.<br>  <br>  With blood that either spilt and bled<br>  Was all the ground they fought on red,<br>  And each knight's hauberk hewn and shred<br>  Left each unmailed and naked, shed<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From off them even as mantles cast:<br>  And oft they breathed, and drew but breath<br>  Brief as the word strong sorrow saith,<br>  And poured and drank the draught of death,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till fate was full at last.<br>  <br>  And Balan, younger born than he<br>  Whom darkness bade him slay, and be<br>  Slain, as in mist where none may see<br>  If aught abide or fall or flee,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew back a little and laid him down, <br>  Dying: but Balen stood, and said,<br>  As one between the quick and dead<br>  Might stand and speak, "What good knight's head<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath won this mortal crown?<br>  <br>  "What knight art thou? for never I<br>  Who now beside thee dead shall die<br>  Found yet the knight afar or nigh<br>  That matched me."  Then his brother's eye<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashed pride and love; he spake and smiled<br>  And felt in death life's quickening flame,<br>  And answered: "Balan is my name,<br>  The good knight Balen's brother; fame<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls and miscalls him wild."<br>  <br>  The cry from Balen's lips that sprang<br>  Sprang sharper than his sword's stroke rang.<br>  More keen than death's or memory's fang,<br>  Through sense and soul the shuddering pang<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shivered: and scarce he had cried, "Alas<br>  That ever I should see this day,"<br>  When sorrow swooned from him away<br>  As blindly back he fell, and lay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sleep lets anguish pass.<br>  <br>  But Balan rose on hands and knees<br>  And crawled by childlike dim degrees<br>  Up toward his brother, as a breeze<br>  Creeps wingless over sluggard seas<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the wind's heart fails it: so<br>  Beneath their mother's eyes had he,<br>  A babe that laughed with joy to be,<br>  Made toward him standing by her knee<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For love's sake long ago.<br>  <br>  Then, gathering strength up for a space,<br>  From off his brother's dying face<br>  With dying hands that wrought apace<br>  While death and life would grant them grace<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loosed his helm and knew not him,<br>  So scored with blood it was, and hewn<br>  Athwart with darkening wounds: but soon<br>  Life strove and shuddered through the swoon<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein its light lay dim.<br>  <br>  And sorrow set these chained words free:<br>  "O Balan, O my brother! me<br>  Thou hast slain, and I, my brother, thee:<br>  And now far hence, on shore and sea,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall all the wide world speak of us."<br>  "Alas," said Balan, "that I might<br>  Not know you, seeing two swords were dight<br>  About you; now the unanswering sight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath here found answer thus.<br>  <br>  "Because you bore another shield<br>  Than yours, that even ere youth could wield<br>  Like arms with manhood's tried and steeled<br>  Shone as my star of battle-field,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deemed it surely might not be<br>  My brother."  Then his brother spake<br>  Fiercely: "Would God, for thy sole sake,<br>  I had my life again, to take<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenge for only thee!<br>  <br>  "For all this deadly work was wrought<br>  Of one false knight's false word and thought,<br>  Whose mortal craft and counsel caught<br>  And snared my faith who doubted nought,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made me put my shield away.<br>  Ah, might I live, I would destroy<br>  That castle for its customs: joy<br>  There makes of grief a deadly toy,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And death makes night of day."<br>  <br>  "Well done were that, if aught were done<br>  Well ever here beneath the sun,"<br>  Said Balan: "better work were none:<br>  For hither since I came and won<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woful honour born of death,<br>  When here my hap it was to slay<br>  A knight who kept this island way,<br>  I might not pass by night or day<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, as this token saith.<br>  <br>  "No more shouldst thou, for all the might<br>  Of heart and hand that seals thee knight<br>  Most noble of all that see the light,<br>  Brother, hadst thou but slain in fight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, and arisen unscathed and whole,<br>  As would to God thou hadst risen! though here<br>  Light is as darkness, hope as fear,<br>  And love as hate: and none draws near<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save toward a mortal goal."<br>  <br>  Then, fair as any poison-flower<br>  Whose blossom blights the withering bower<br>  Whereon its blasting breath has power,<br>  Forth fared the lady of the tower<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a lady and many a knight,<br>  And came across the water-way<br>  Even where on death's dim border lay<br>  Those brethren sent of her to slay<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And die in kindless fight.<br>  <br>  And all those hard light hearts were swayed<br>  With pity passing like a shade<br>  That stays not, and may be not stayed,<br>  To hear the mutual moan they made,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each to behold his brother die,<br>  Saying , "Both we came out of one tomb,<br>  One star-crossed mother's woful womb,<br>  And so within one grave-pit's gloom<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untimely shall we lie."<br>  <br>  And Balan prayed, as God should bless<br>  That lady for her gentleness,<br>  That where the battle's mortal stress<br>  Had made for them perforce to press<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed whence never man may rise <br>  They twain, free now from hopes and fears,<br>  Might sleep; and she, as one that hears,<br>  Bowed her bright head: and very tears<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell from her cold fierce eyes.<br>  <br>  Then Balen prayed her send a priest<br>  To housel them, that ere they ceased<br>  The hansel of the heavenly feast<br>  That fills with light from the answering east<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset of the life of man<br>  Might bless them, and their lips be kissed<br>  With death's requickening eucharist,<br>  And death's and life's dim sunlit mist<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass as a stream that ran.<br>  <br>  And so their dying rites were done:<br>  And Balen, seeing the death-struck sun<br>  Sink, spake as he whose goal is won:<br>  "Now, when our trophied tomb is one,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over us our tale is writ,<br>  How two that loved each other, two<br>  Born and begotten brethren, slew<br>  Each other, none that reads anew<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall choose but weep for it.<br>  <br>  "And no good knight and no good man<br>  Whose eye shall ever come to scan<br>  The record of the imperious ban<br>  That made our life so sad a span<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall read or hear, who shall not pray<br>  For us for ever." Then anon<br>  Died Balan; but the sun was gone,<br>  And deep the stars of midnight shone,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere Balen passed away.<br>  <br>  And there low lying, as hour on hour<br>  Fled, all his life in all its flower<br>  Came back as in a sunlit shower<br>  Of dreams, when sweet-souled sleep has power<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On life less sweet and glad to be.<br>  He drank the draught of life's first wine<br>  Again: he saw the moorland shine,<br>  The rioting rapids of the Tyne,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods, the cliffs, the sea.<br>  <br>  The joy that lives at heart and home,<br>  The joy to rest, the joy to roam,<br>  The joy of crags and scaurs he clomb,<br>  The rapture of the encountering foam<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embraced and breasted of the boy,<br>  The first good steed his knees bestrode,<br>  The first wild sound of songs that flowed<br>  Through ears that thrilled and heart that glowed,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulfilled his death with joy.<br>  <br>  So, dying not as a coward that dies<br>  And dares not look in death's dim eyes<br>  Straight as the stars on seas and skies<br>  Whence moon and sun recoil and rise,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked on life and death, and slept.<br>  And there with morning Merlin came,<br>  And on the tomb that told their fame <br>  He wrote by Balan's Balen's name,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gazed thereon, and wept.<br>  <br>  For all his heart within him yearned <br>  With pity like as fire that burned.<br>  The fate his fateful eye discerned<br>  Far off now dimmed it, ere he turned<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face toward Camelot, to tell<br>  Arthur of all the storms that woke<br>  Round Balen, and the dolorous stroke,<br>  And how that last blind battle broke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consummated spell.<br>  <br>  "Alas," King Arthur said, "this day<br>  I have heard the worst that woe might say:<br>  For in this world that wanes away<br>  I know not two such knight as they."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the tale that memory writes<br>  Of men whose names like stars shall stand,<br>  Balen and Balan, sure of hand<br>  Two brethren of Northumberland,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In life and death good knights.<br>
