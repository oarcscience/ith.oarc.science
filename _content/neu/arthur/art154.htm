You teach me language, sir, as one that knows<br>  The debt of love I owe unto her vertues;<br>  Wherein like a true courtier I have fed<br>  My self with hope of fair success, and now<br>  Attend your wisht consent to my long suit.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Believe me, youthful lord,<br>  Time could not give an opportunity<br>  More fitting your desires, always provided,<br>  My daughters love be suited with my grant.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  'Tis the condition, sir, her promise seal'd.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Ist so, Constantia?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSTANTIA.  I was content to give him words for oathes;<br>  He swore so oft he lov'd me--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  That thou believest him?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSTANTIA.  He is a man, I hope.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  That's in the trial, girl.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSTANTIA.  However, I am a woman, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  The law's on thy side then: sha't have a husband,<br>  I, and a worthy one.  Take her, brave Cornwal,<br>  And make our happiness great as our wishes.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Sir, I thank you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLOSTER.  Double the fortunes of the day, my lord,<br>  And crown my wishes too: I have a son here,<br>  Who in my absence would protest no less<br>  Unto your other daughter.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Ha, Gloster, is it so? what says Lord Edwin?<br>  Will she protest as much to thee?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  Else must she want some of her sisters faith, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Of her credulity much rather, sir:<br>  My lord, you are a soldier, and methinks<br>  The height of that profession should diminish<br>  All heat of loves desires,<br>  Being so late employ'd in blood and ruine.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  The more my conscience tyes me to repair<br>  The worlds losses in a new succession.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Necessity, it seems, ties your affections then,<br>  And at that rate I would unwillingly<br>  Be thrust upon you; a wife is a dish soon cloys, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  Weak and diseased appetites it may.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Most of your making have dull stomacks, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  If that be all, girl, thou shalt quicken him;<br>  Be kinde to him, Modestia:  Noble Edwin,<br>  Let it suffice, what's mine in her speaks yours;<br>  For her consent, let your fair suit go on,<br>  She is a woman, sir, and will be won.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  You give me comfort, sir.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Toclio</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.                        Now, Toclio?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  The king, my honor'd lords, requires your presence,<br>  And calls a councel for return of answer<br>  Unto the parling enemy, whose embassadors<br>  Are on the way to court.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.             So suddenly?<br>  Chester, it seems, has ply'd them hard at war,<br>  They sue so fast for peace, which by my advice<br>  They ne're shall have, unless they leave the realm.<br>  Come, noble Gloster, let's attend the king.<br>  It lies, sir, in your son to do me pleasure,<br>  And save the charges of a wedding dinner;<br>  If you'l make haste to end your love affairs,<br>  One cost may give discharge to both my cares.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Exit Donobert, Gloster</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  I'le do my best.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Now, Toclio, what stirring news at court?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  Oh, my lord, the court's all fill'd with rumor, the city with news, and the country with wonder, and all the bells i'th' kingdom must proclaim it, we have a new holy-day a coming.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSTANTIA.  A holy-day! for whom? for thee?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  Me, madam! 'sfoot!  I'de be loath that any man Should make a holy-day for me yet:<br>  In brief, 'tis thus: there's here arriv'd at court,<br>  Sent by the Earl of Chester to the king,<br>  A man of rare esteem for holyness,<br>  A reverent hermit, that by miracle<br>  Not onely saved our army,<br>  But without aid of man o'rethrew<br>  The pagan host, and with such wonder, sir,<br>  As might confirm a kingdom to his faith.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  This is strange news, indeed; where is he?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  In conference with the king, that much respects him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Trust me, I long to see him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  Faith, you will finde no great pleasure in him, for ought that I can see, lady.  They say he is half a prophet too: would he could tell me any news of the lost prince; there's twenty talents offer'd to him that finds him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Such news was breeding in the morning.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  And now it has birth and life, sir.  If fortune bless me, I'le once more search those woods where then we lost him; I know not yet what fate may follow me.     [<i> Exit</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Fortune go with you, sir.  Come, fair mistriss,<br>  Your sister and Lord Edwin are in game,<br>  And all their wits at stake to win the set.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSTANTIA.  My sister has the hand yet; we had best leave them:<br>  She will be out anon as well as I;<br>  He wants but cunning to put in a dye.<br>  <i> Exit Cador, Constantia</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  You are a cunning gamester, madam.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  It is a desperate game, indeed, this marriage,<br>  Where there's no winning without loss to either.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  Why, what but your perfection, noble lady,<br>  Can bar the worthiness of this my suit?<br>  If so you please I count my happiness<br>  From difficult obtaining, you shall see<br>  My duty and observance.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  There shall be place to neither, noble sir;<br>  I do beseech you, let this mild reply<br>  Give answer to your suit: for here I vow,<br>  If e're I change my virgin name, by you<br>  It gains or looses.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.           My wishes have their crown.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Let them confine you then,<br>  As to my promise you give faith and credence.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  In your command my willing absence speaks it.  [<i> Exit</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Noble and vertuous: could I dream of marriage,<br>  I should affect thee, Edwin.  Oh, my soul,<br>  Here's something tells me that these best of creatures,<br>  These models of the world, weak man and woman,<br>  Should have their souls, their making, life, and being,<br>  To some more excellent use: if what the sense<br>  Calls pleasure were our ends, we might justly blame<br>  Great natures wisdom, who rear'd a building<br>  Of so much art and beauty to entertain<br>  A guest so far incertain, so imperfect:<br>  If onely speech distinguish us from beasts,<br>  Who know no inequality of birth or place,<br>  But still to fly from goodness: oh, how base<br>  Were life at such a rate!  No, no, that power<br>  That gave to man his being, speech and wisdom,<br>  Gave it for thankfulness.  To him alone<br>  That made me thus, may I whence truly know,<br>  I'le pay to him, not man, the love I owe.    [<i> Exit</i> .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <center>SCENE II<br>  </center> <br>  <br>  <i> Flourish cornets.  Enter Aurelius King of Brittain, Donobert, Gloster, Cador, Edwin, Toclio, Oswold, and Attendants</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  No tiding of our brother yet?  'Tis strange,<br>  So ne're the court, and in our own land too,<br>  And yet no news of him: oh, this loss<br>  Tempers the sweetness of our happy conquests<br>  With much untimely sorrow.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.               Royal sir,<br>  His safety being unquestion'd should to time<br>  Leave the redress of sorrow: were he dead,<br>  Or taken by the foe, our fatal loss<br>  Had wanted no quick herald to disclose it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  That hope alone sustains me,<br>  Nor will we be so ingrateful unto heaven<br>  To question what we fear with what we enjoy.<br>  Is answer of our message yet return'd<br>  From that religious man, the holy hermit,<br>  Sent by the Earl of Chester to confirm us<br>  In that miraculous act?  For 'twas no less:<br>  Our army being in rout, nay, quite o'rethrown,<br>  As Chester writes, even then this holy man,<br>  Arm'd with his cross and staff, went smiling on,<br>  And boldly fronts the foe; at sight of whom<br>  The Saxons stood amaz'd: for, to their seeming,<br>  Above the hermit's head appear'd such brightness,<br>  Such clear and glorious beams, as if our men<br>  March't all in fire; wherewith the pagans fled,<br>  And by our troops were all to death pursu'd.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLOSTER.  'Tis full of wonder, sir.<br>  Oh, Gloster, he's a jewel worth a kingdom.<br>  Where's Oswold with his answer?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  'Tis here, my royal lord.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  In writing? will he not sit with us?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  His orizons perform'd, he bad me say,<br>  He would attend with all submission.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Proceed to councel then; and let some give order,<br>  The embassadors being come to take our answer,<br>  They have admittance.  Oswold, Toclio,<br>  Be it your charge!--     [<i> Exeunt Oswold and Toclio</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  And now, my lords, observe<br>  The holy councel of this reverend hermit:<br>  <br>  [<i> Reads</i> .]  <i> As you respect your safety, limit not<br>  That onely power that hath protected you;<br>  Trust not an open enemy too far,<br>  He's yet a looser, and knows you have won;<br>  Mischiefs not ended are but then begun</i> .<br>  <i> Anselme the Hermit</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Powerful and pithie, which my advice confirms:<br>  No man leaves physick when his sickness slakes,<br>  But doubles the receipts: the word of peace<br>  Seems fair to blood-shot eyes, but being appli'd<br>  With such a medicine as blinds all the sight<br>  Argues desire of cure, but not of art.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  You argue from defects; if both the name<br>  And the condition of the peace be one,<br>  It is to be prefer'd, and in the offer,<br>  Made by the Saxon, I see nought repugnant.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLOSTER.  The time of truce requir'd for thirty days<br>  Carries suspicion in it, since half that space<br>  Will serve to strength their weakned regiment.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Who in less time will undertake to free<br>  Our country from them?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.              Leave that unto our fortune.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Is not our bold and hopeful general<br>  Still master of the field, their legions faln,<br>  The rest intrencht for fear, half starv'd, and wounded,<br>  And shall we now give o're our fair advantage?<br>  'Fore heaven, my lord, the danger is far more<br>  In trusting to their words then to their weapons.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Oswold</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  The embassadors are come, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.                              Conduct them in.<br>  We are resolv'd, my lords, since policy fail'd<br>  In the beginning, it shall have no hand<br>  In the conclusion.<br>  That heavenly power that hath so well begun<br>  Their fatal overthrow, I know, can end it:<br>  From which fair hope my self will give them answer.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <i> Flourish cornets</i> .<i>   Enter Artesia with the Saxon lords</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  What's here? a woman orator?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Peace, Donobert!--Speak, what are you, lady?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.  The sister of the Saxon general,<br>  Warlike Ostorius the East Anglese king;<br>  My name Artesia, who in terms of love<br>  Brings peace and health to great Aurelius,<br>  Wishing she may return as fair a present<br>  As she makes tender of.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  The fairest present e're mine eyes were blest with!--<br>  Command a chair there for this Saxon beauty:--<br>  Sit, lady, we'l confer: your warlike brother<br>  Sues for a peace, you say?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.  With endless love unto your state and person.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Ha's sent a moving orator, believe me.--<br>  What thinkst thou, Donobert?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Believe me, sir, were I but yong agen,<br>  This gilded pill might take my stomack quickly.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  True, thou art old: how soon we do forget<br>  Our own defects!  Fair damsel,--oh, my tongue<br>  Turns traitor, and will betray my heart--sister to<br>  Our enemy:--'sdeath, her beauty mazes me,<br>  I cannot speak if I but look on her.--<br>  What's that we did conclude?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  This, royal lord--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Pish, thou canst not utter it:--<br>  Fair'st of creatures, tell the king your brother,<br>  That we, in love--ha!--and honor to our country,<br>  Command his armies to depart our realm.<br>  But if you please, fair soul--Lord Donobert,<br>  Deliver you our pleasure.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.              I shall, sir:<br>  Lady, return, and certifie your brother--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Thou art too blunt and rude! return so soon?<br>  Fie, let her stay, and send some messenger<br>  To certifie our pleasure.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.              What meanes your grace?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  To give her time of rest to her long journey;<br>  We would not willingly be thought uncivil.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.  Great King of Brittain, let it not seem strange,<br>  To embrace the princely offers of a friend,<br>  Whose vertues with thine own, in fairest merit,<br>  Both states in peace and love may now inherit.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  She speakes of love agen:<br>  Sure, 'tis my fear, she knows I do not hate her.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.  Be, then, thy self, most great Aurelius,<br>  And let not envy nor a deeper sin<br>  In these thy councellors deprive thy goodness<br>  Of that fair honor we in seeking peace<br>  Give first to thee, who never use to sue<br>  But force our wishes.  Yet, if this seem light,<br>  Oh, let my sex, though worthless your respect,<br>  Take the report of thy humanity,<br>  Whose mild and vertuous life loud fame displayes,<br>  As being o'recome by one so worthy praise.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  She has an angels tongue.--Speak still.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  This flattery is gross, sir; hear no more on't.--<br>  Lady, these childish complements are needless;<br>  You have your answer, and believe it, madam,<br>  His grace, though yong, doth wear within his breast<br>  Too grave a councellor to be seduc't<br>  By smoothing flattery or oyly words.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.  I come not, sir, to wooe him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  'Twere folly, if you should; you must not wed him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Shame take thy tongue!  Being old and weak thy self,<br>  Thou doat'st, and looking on thine own defects,<br>  Speak'st what thou'dst wish in me.  Do I command<br>  The deeds of others, mine own act not free?<br>  Be pleas'd to smile or frown, we respect neither:<br>  My will and rule shall stand and fall together.<br>  Most fair Artesia, see the king descends<br>  To give thee welcome with these warlike Saxons,<br>  And now on equal terms both sues and grants:<br>  Instead of truce, let a perpetual league<br>  Seal our united bloods in holy marriage;<br>  Send the East Angles king this happy news,<br>  That thou with me hast made a league for ever,<br>  And added to his state a friend and brother.<br>  Speak, dearest love, dare you confirm this title?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.  I were no woman to deny a good<br>  So high and noble to my fame and country.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Live, then, a queen in Brittain.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLOSTER.  He meanes to marry her.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Death! he shall marry the devil first!<br>  Marry a pagan, an idolater?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  He has won her quickly.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  She was woo'd afore she came, sure,<br>  Or came of purpose to conclude the match.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Who dares oppose our will?  My Lord of Gloster,<br>  Be you embassador unto our brother,<br>  The brother of our queen Artesia;<br>  Tell him for such our entertainment looks him,<br>  Our marriage adding to the happiness<br>  Of our intended joys; mans good or ill<br>  In this like waves agree, come double still.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Hermit</i> .<br>  <br>  Who's this? the hermit?  Welcome, my happiness!<br>  Our countries hope, most reverent holy man,<br>  I wanted but thy blessing to make perfect<br>  The infinite sum of my felicity.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  Alack, sweet prince, that happiness is yonder,<br>  Felicity and thou art far asunder;<br>  This world can never give it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Thou art deceiv'd: see here what I have found,<br>  Beauty, alliance, peace, and strength of friends,<br>  All in this all exceeding excellence:<br>  The league's confirm'd.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  With whom, dear lord?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  With the great brother of this beauteous woman,<br>  The royal Saxon king.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.            Oh, then I see,<br>  And fear thou art too near thy misery.<br>  What magick could so linck thee to this mischief?<br>  By all the good that thou hast reapt by me,<br>  Stand further from destruction.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  Speak as a man, and I shall hope to obey thee.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  Idolaters, get hence! fond king, let go:<br>  Thou hug'st thy ruine and thy countries woe.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Well spoke, old father; too him, bait him soundly.<br>  Now, by heavens blest Lady, I can scarce keep patience.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. SAXON LORD.  What devil is this?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. SAXON LORD.  That cursed Christian, by whose hellish charmes<br>  Our army was o'rethrown.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  Why do you dally, sir?  Oh, tempt not heaven;<br>  Warm not a serpent in your naked bosom:<br>  Discharge them from your court.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.                    Thou speak'st like madness!<br>  Command the frozen shepherd to the shade,<br>  When he sits warm i'th' sun; the fever sick<br>  To add more heat unto his burning pain:<br>  These may obey, 'tis less extremity<br>  Then thou enjoynst to me.  Cast but thine eye<br>  Upon this beauty, do it, I'le forgive thee,<br>  Though jealousie in others findes no pardon;<br>  Then say thou dost not love; I shall then swear<br>  Th'art immortal and no earthly man.<br>  Oh, blame then my mortallity, not me.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  It is thy weakness brings thy misery,<br>  Unhappy prince.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.    Be milder in thy doom.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  'Tis you that must indure heavens doom, which faln<br>  Remember's just.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.  Thou shalt not live to see it.--How fares my lord?<br>  If my poor presence breed dislike, great prince,<br>  I am no such neglected soul, will seek<br>  To tie you to your word.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AURELIUS.  My word, dear love! may my religion,<br>  Crown, state, and kingdom fail, when I fail thee.<br>  Command Earl Chester to break up the camp<br>  Without disturbance to our Saxon friends;<br>  Send every hour swift posts to hasten on<br>  The king her brother, to conclude this league,<br>  This endless happy peace of love and marriage;<br>  Till when provide for revels, and give charge<br>  That nought be wanting which make our triumphs<br>  Sportful and free to all.  If such fair blood<br>  Ingender ill, man must not look for good.<br>  <i> Exit all but Hermit</i> .<i>   Florish</i> .<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Modestia, reading in a book</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  How much the oft report of this blest hermit<br>  Hath won on my desires; I must behold him:<br>  And sure this should be he.  Oh, the world's folly,<br>  Proud earth and dust, how low a price bears goodness!<br>  All that should make man absolute shines in him.<br>  Much reverent sir, may I without offence<br>  Give interruption to your holy thoughts?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  What would you, lady?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  That which till now ne're found a language in me:<br>  I am in love.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.    In love? with what?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.                     With vertue.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  There's no blame in that.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Nay, sir, with you, with your religious life,<br>  Your vertue, goodness, if there be a name<br>  To express affection greater, that,<br>  That would I learn and utter: reverent sir,<br>  If there be any thing to bar my suit,<br>  Be charitable and expose it; your prayers<br>  Are the same orizons which I will number.<br>  Holy sir,<br>  Keep not instruction back from willingness,<br>  Possess me of that knowledge leads you on<br>  To this humility; for well I know,<br>  Were greatness good, you would not live so low.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  Are you a virgin?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Yes, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.  Your name?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODESTIA.  Modestia.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HERMIT.

Away, follow me no further, I am none of thy brother.  What, with childe? great with childe, and knows not whose the father on't!  I am asham'd to call thee sister.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Believe me, brother, he was a gentleman.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Nay, I believe that; he gives arms, and legs too, and has made you the herald to blaze 'em: but, Joan, Joan, sister Joan, can you tell me his name that did it? how shall we call my cousin, your bastard, when we have it?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Alas, I know not the gentlemans name, brother.<br>  I met him in these woods the last great hunting;<br>  He was so kinde and proffer'd me so much,<br>  As I had not the heart to ask him more.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Not his name? why, this showes your country breeding now; had you been brought up i'th' city, you'd have got a father first, and the childe afterwards: hast thou no markes to know him by?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  He had a most rich attire, a fair hat and feather, a gilt sword, and most excellent hangers.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Pox on his hangers, would he had bin gelt for his labor.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Had you but heard him swear, you would have thought--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  I, as you did; swearing and lying goes together still.  Did his oathes get you with childe? we shall have a roaring boy then, yfaith.  Well, sister, I must leave you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Dear brother, stay, help me to finde him out,<br>  I'le ask no further.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  'Sfoot, who should I finde? who should I ask for?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Alas, I know not, he uses in these woods,<br>  And these are witness of his oathes and promise.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  We are like to have a hot suit on't, when our best witness's but a knight a'th' post.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Do but enquire this forrest, I'le go with you;<br>  Some happy fate may guide us till we meet him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Meet him? and what name shall we have for him, when we meet him?  'Sfoot, thou neither knowst him nor canst tell what to call him.  Was ever man tyr'd with such a business, to have a sister got with childe, and know not who did it?  Well, you shall see him, I'le do my best for you, Ile make proclamation; if these woods and trees, as you say, will bear any witness, let them answer.  Oh yes: If there be any man that wants a name will come in for conscience sake, and acknowledge himself to be a whore-master, he shal have that laid to his charge in an hour, he shall not be rid on in an age; if he have lands, he shall have an heir; if he have patience, he shall have a wife; if he have neither lands nor patience, he shall have a whore.

How like a voice that Eccho spake, but oh,<br>  My thoughts are lost for ever in amazement.<br>  Could I but meet a man to tell her beauties,<br>  These trees would bend their tops to kiss the air<br>  That from my lips should give her praises up.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  He talks of a woman, sister.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  This may be he, brother.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  View him well; you see, he has a fair sword, but his hangers are faln.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Here did I see her first, here view her beauty:<br>  Oh, had I known her name, I had been happy.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Sister, this is he, sure; he knows not thy name neither.  A couple of wise fools yfaith, to get children, and know not one another.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  You weeping leaves, upon whose tender cheeks<br>  Doth stand a flood of tears at my complaint,<br>  Who heard my vows and oathes--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Law, Law, he has been a great swearer too; tis he, sister.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  For having overtook her;<br>  As I have seen a forward blood-hound strip<br>  The swifter of the cry, ready to seize<br>  His wished hopes, upon the sudden view,<br>  Struck with astonishment, at his arriv'd prey,<br>  Instead of seizure stands at fearful bay;<br>  Or like to Marius soldiers, who, o'retook,<br>  The eye sight killing Gorgon at one look<br>  Made everlasting stand: so fear'd my power,<br>  Whose cloud aspir'd the sun, dissolv'd a shower.<br>  Pigmalion, then I tasted thy sad fate,<br>  Whose ivory picture and my fair were one:<br>  Our dotage past imagination.<br>  I saw and felt desire--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Pox a your fingering! did he feel, sister?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  But enjoy'd not.<br>  Oh fate, thou hadst thy days and nights to feed<br>  On calm affection; one poor sight was all,<br>  Converts my pleasure to perpetual thrall:<br>  Imbracing thine, thou lostest breath and desire,<br>  So I, relating mine, will here expire.<br>  For here I vow to you mournful plants,<br>  Who were the first made happy by her fame,<br>  Never to part hence, till I know her name.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Give me thy hand, sister, <i> the childe has found his father</i> .  This is he, sure; as I am a man, had I been a woman, these kinde words would have won me, I should have had a great belly too, that's certain.  Well, I'le speak to him.--Most honest and fleshly minded gentleman, give me your hand, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Ha, what art thou, that thus rude and boldly darest<br>  Take notice of a wretch so much ally'd<br>  To misery as I am?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Nay, sir, for our aliance, I shall be found to be a poor brother in law of your worships: the gentlewoman you spake on is my sister: you see what a clew she spreads; her name is Joan Go-too't.  I am her elder, but she has been at it before me; 'tis a womans fault.--Pox a this bashfulness! come forward, jug, prethee, speak to him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Have you e're seen me, lady?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Seen ye? ha, ha!  It seems she has felt you too: here's a yong Go-too't a coming, sir; she is my sister; we all love to Go-too't, as well as your worship.  She's a maid yet, but you may make her a wife, when you please, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  I am amaz'd with wonder: tell me, woman,<br>  What sin have you committed worthy this?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Do you not know me, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Know thee! as I do thunder, hell, and mischief;<br>  Witch, scullion, hag!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  I see he will marry her; he speaks so like a husband.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Death!  I will cut their tongues out for this blasphemy.<br>  Strumpet, villain, where have you ever seen me?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Speak for your self, with a pox to ye.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Slaves, Ile make you curse your selves for this temptation.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Oh, sir, if ever you did speak to me,<br>  It was in smoother phrase, in fairer language.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Lightning consume me, if I ever saw thee.<br>  My rage o'reflowes my blood, all patience flies me.     [<i> Beats her</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.

Make haste, sir, this way the sound came, it was a wood.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  See where she is, and the prince, the price of all our wishes.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  The prince, say ye? ha's made a poor subject of me, I am sure.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  Sweet prince, noble Uter, speak, how fare you, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  Dear sir, recal your self; your fearful absence<br>  Hath won too much already on the grief<br>  Of our sad king, from whom our laboring search<br>  Hath had this fair success in meeting you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  His silence and his looks argue distraction.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Nay, he's mad, sure, he will not acknowledge my sister, nor the childe neither.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  Let us entreat your grace along with us;<br>  Your sight will bring new life to the king your brother.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOCLIO.  Will you go, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Yes, any whether; guide me, all's hell I see;<br>  Man may change air, but not his misery.     [<i> Exit Prince, Toclio</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.

What would you, fair one?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Sure, I have seen you in these woods e're this.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  Trust me, never; I never saw this place,<br>  Till at this time my friend conducted me.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  The more's my sorrow then.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OSWOLD.  Would I could comfort you.<br>  I am a bachelor, but it seems you have<br>  A husband, you have been fouly o'reshot else.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.

'Sfoot, I have seen many fair faces in my time: prithee, look up, and do not weep so.  Sure, pretty wanton, I have seen this face before.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.

Oh, give me pardon, sir; 'twas too much joy<br>  Opprest my loving thoughts; I know you were<br>  Too noble to deny me--ha!  Where is he?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.

She was quickly wooed and won: not six days since<br>  Arrived an enemy to sue for peace,<br>  And now crown'd Queen of Brittain; this is strange.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.

Yes, and our general commanded home.<br>  Son Edwin, have you seen him since?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  He's come to court, but will not view the presence,<br>  Nor speak unto the king; he's so discontent<br>  At this so strange aliance with the Saxon,<br>  As nothing can perswade his patience.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.

Do not deceive me by your flatteries:<br>  Is not the Saxon here? the league confirm'd?<br>  The marriage ratifi'd? the court divided<br>  With pagan infidels, the least part Christians,<br>  At least in their commands?  Oh, the gods!<br>  It is a thought that takes away my sleep,<br>  And dulls my senses so I scarcely know you:<br>  Prepare my horses, Ile away to Chester.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAPTAIN.  What shall we do with our companies, my lord?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Keep them at home to increase cuckolds,<br>  And get some cases for your captainships;<br>  Smooth up your brows, the wars has spoil'd your faces,<br>  And few will now regard you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Preserve your patience, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Preserve your honors, lords, your countries safety,<br>  Your lives and lands from strangers.  What black devil<br>  Could so bewitch the king, so to discharge<br>  A royal army in the height of conquest,<br>  Nay, even already made victorious,<br>  To give such credit to an enemy,<br>  A starved foe, a stragling fugitive,<br>  Beaten beneath our feet, so low dejected,<br>  So servile, and so base, as hope of life<br>  Had won them all to leave the land for ever?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  It was the kings will.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  It was your want of wisdom,<br>  that should have laid before his tender youth<br>  The dangers of a state, where forain powers<br>  Bandy for soveraignty with lawful kings;<br>  Who being setled once, to assure themselves,<br>  Will never fail to seek the blood and life<br>  Of all competitors.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  Your words sound well, my lord, and point at safety,<br>  Both for the realm and us; but why did you,<br>  Within whose power it lay, as general,<br>  With full commission to dispose the war,<br>  Lend ear to parly with the weakned foe?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Oh the good gods!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  And on that parly came this embassie.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  You will hear me?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  Your letters did declare it to the king,<br>  Both of the peace, and all conditions<br>  Brought by this Saxon lady, whose fond love<br>  Has thus bewitched him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  I will curse you all as black as hell,<br>  Unless you hear me; your gross mistake would make<br>  Wisdom her self run madding through the streets,<br>  And quarrel with her shadow.  Death!<br>  Why kill'd ye not that woman?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  GLOSTER.        Oh, my lord!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.

This rage is vain, my lord:<br>  What the king does nor they nor you can help.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  My sword must fail me then.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  'Gainst whom will you expose it?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  What's that to you? 'gainst all the devils in hell,<br>  To guard my country.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.            These are airy words.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Sir, you tread too hard upon my patience.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  I speak the duty of a subjects faith,<br>  And say agen, had you been here in presence,<br>  What the king did, you had not dar'd to cross it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.

Not dare? thou liest beneath thy lungs.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLOSTER.  No more, son Edwin.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  I have done, sir; I take my leave.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  But thou shalt not, you shall take no leave of me, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  For wisdoms sake, my lord--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Sir, I'le leave him, and you, and all of you,<br>  The court and king, and let my sword and friends<br>  Shuffle for Edols safety: stay you here,<br>  And hug the Saxons, till they cut your throats,<br>  Or bring the land to servile slavery.<br>  Such yokes of baseness Chester must not suffer.<br>  Go, and repent betimes these foul misdeeds,<br>  For in this league all our whole kingdom bleeds,<br>  Which Ile prevent, or perish.

She binds my service to her: ha! a jewel; 'tis<br>  A fair one, trust me, and methinks, it much<br>  Resembles something I have seen with her.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENTLEWOMAN.  It is an artificial crab, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  A creature that goes backward.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENTLEWOMAN.  True, from the way it looks.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.

Come, sister, thou that art all fool, all mad-woman.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Prithee, have patience, we are now at court.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  At court! ha, ha, that proves thy madness: was there ever any woman in thy taking travel'd to court for a husband?  'Slid, 'tis enough for them to get children, and the city to keep 'em, and the countrey to finde nurses: every thing must be done in his due place, sister.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.

Oh, dear brother,<br>  This night my sweet friend came to comfort me;<br>  I saw him and embrac't him in mine arms.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Why did you not hold him, and call me to help you?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Alas, I thought I had been with him still,<br>  But when I wak't--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Ah! pox of all loger-heads, then you were but in a dream all this while, and we may still go look him.

He much resembles him; but, sure, my friend,<br>  Brother, was not so high of stature.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.

No, sir, we mean the own father: it may be you, sir, for any thing we know; I think the childe is like you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.

Nay, 'tis not born yet, sir, 'tis forth coming, you see; the childe must have a father: what do you think of my sister?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  Why, I think if she ne're had husband, she's a whore, and thou a fool.  Farewell.     [<i> Exit</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  I thank you, sir.

A couple of great Brittains you may see by our bellies, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  And what of this, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Why, thus the matter stands, sir: there's one of your courtiers hunting nags has made a gap through another mans inclosure.  Now, sir, here's the question, who should be at charge of a fur-bush to stop it?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  Ha, ha, this is out of my element: the law must end it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Your worship says well; for, surely, I think some lawyer had a hand in the business, we have such a troublesom issue.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  But what's thy business with me now?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Nay, sir, the business is done already, you may see by my sisters belly.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  Oh, now I finde thee: this gentlewoman, it seems, has been humbled.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  As low as the ground would give her leave, sir, and your worship knows this: though there be many fathers without children, yet to have a childe without a father were most unnatural.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  That's true, ifaith, I never heard of a childe yet that e're begot his father.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Why, true, you say wisely, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  And therefore I conclude, that he that got the childe is without all question the father of it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  I, now you come to the matter, sir; and our suit is to your worship for the discovery of this father.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  Why, lives he in the court here?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Yes, sir, and I desire but marriage.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  And does the knave refuse it?  Come, come, be merry, wench; he shall marry thee, and keep the childe too, if my knighthood can do any thing.  I am bound by mine orders to help distressed ladies, and can there be a greater injury to a woman with childe, then to lack a father for't?  I am asham'd of your simpleness: Come, come, give me a courtiers fee for my pains, and Ile be thy advocate my self, and justice shall be found; nay, Ile sue the law for it; but give me my fee first.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  If all the money I have i'th' world will do it, you shall have it, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  An angel does it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Nay, there's two, for your better eye sight, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  Why, well said!  Give me thy hand, wench, Ile teach thee a trick for all this, shall get a father for thy childe presently, and this it is, mark now: You meet a man, as you meet me now, thou claimest marriage of me, and layest the childe to my charge; I deny it: push, that's nothing, hold thy claim fast, thy words carries it, and no law can withstand it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Ist possible?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  Past all opposition; her own word carries it: let her challenge any man, the childe shall call him father; there's a trick for your money now.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Troth, sir, we thank you, we'l make use of your trick, and go no further to seek the childe a father, for we challenge you, sir: sister, lay it to him, he shall marry thee, I shall have a worshipful old man to my brother.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  Ha, ha, I like thy pleasantness.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Nay, indeed, sir, I do challenge you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  You think we jest, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.

Never grieve, wench, show me the man, and process shall fly out.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  'Tis enough for us to finde the children, we look that you should finde the father, and therefore either do us justice, or we'l stand to our first challenge.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.  Would you have justice without an adversary?  Unless you can show me the man, I can do you no good in it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Why, then I hope you'l do us no harm, sir; you'l restore my money.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR NICODEMUS.

Well, I wonder how my poor sister does, after all this thundering; I think she's dead, for I can hear no tidings of her.  Those woods yields small comfort for her; I could meet nothing but a swinherds wife, keeping hogs by the forestside, but neither she nor none of her sowes would stir a foot to help us; indeed, I think she durst not trust her self amongst the trees with me, for I must needs confess I offer'd some kindness to her.  Well, I would fain know what's become of my sister: if she have brought me a yong cousin, his face may be a picture to finde his father by.  So oh! sister Joan, Joan Go-too't, where art thou?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i> Within</i> .]  JOAN.  Here, here, brother, stay but a while, I come to thee.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  O brave! she's alive still, I know her voice; she speaks, and speaks cherfully, methinks.  How now, what moon-calf has she got with her?<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Joan and Merlin with a book</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Come, my dear Merlin, why dost thou fix thine eye<br>  So deeply on that book?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.              To sound the depth<br>  Of arts, of learning, wisdom, knowledge.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Oh, my dear, dear son,<br>  Those studies fits thee when thou art a man.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Why, mother, I can be but half a man at best,<br>  And that is your mortality; the rest<br>  In me is spirit; 'tis not meat, nor time,<br>  That gives this growth and bigness; no, my years<br>  Shall be more strange then yet my birth appears.<br>  Look, mother, there's my uncle.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  How doest thou know him, son? thou never saw'st him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Yet I know him, and know the pains he has taken for ye, to finde out my father.--Give me your hand, good uncle.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Ha, ha, I'de laugh at that, yfaith.  Do you know me, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Yes, by the same token that even now you kist the swinherds-wife i'th' woods, and would have done more, if she would have let you, uncle.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  A witch, a witch, a witch, sister: rid him out of your company, he is either a witch or a conjurer; he could never have known this else.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Pray, love him, brother, he is my son.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Ha, ha, this is worse then all the rest, yfaith; by his beard he is more like your husband.  Let me see, is your great belly gone?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Yes, and this the happy fruit.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  What, this hartichoke?  A childe born with a beard on his face?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Yes, and strong legs to go, and teeth to eat.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  You can nurse up your self, then?  There's some charges sav'd for soap and caudle.  'Slid, I have heard of some that has been born with teeth, but never none with such a talking tongue before.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Come, come, you must use him kindly, brother;<br>  Did you but know his worth, you would make much of him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Make much of a moncky?  This is worse then Tom Thumb, that let a fart in his mothers belly; a childe to speak, eat, and go the first hour of his birth; nay, such a baby as had need of a barber before he was born too; why, sister, this is monstrous, and shames all our kindred.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  That thus 'gainst nature and our common births<br>  He comes thus furnisht to salute the world,<br>  Is power of Fates, and gift of his great father.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.

The devil it is; ha, ha, is this your sweet-heart, sister? have we run through the countrey, haunted the city, and examin'd the court to finde out a gallant with a hat and feather, and a silken sword, and golden hangers, and do you now bring me to a ragamuffin with a face like a frying-pan?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Fie, brother, you mistake, behold him better.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  How's this? do you juggle with me, or are mine eyes matches?  Hat and feather, sword, and hangers, and all! this is a gallant indeed, sister; this has all the marks of him we look for.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEVIL.  And you have found him now, sir:<br>  Give me your hand, I now must call you brother.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.

Nay, I am not afraid, and you were the devil, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEVIL.  Thou needst not; keep with thy sister still,<br>  And Ile supply your wants, you shall lack nothing<br>  That gold and wealth can purchase.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Thank you, brother: we have gone many a weary step to finde you; you may be a husband for a lady, for you are far fetcht and dear bought, I assure you.  Pray, how should I call your son, my cousin here?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEVIL.  His name is Merlin.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Merlin?  Your hand, cousin Merlin; for your fathers sake I accept you to my kindred: if you grow in all things as your beard does, you will be talkt on.  By your mothers side, cousin, you come of the Go-too'ts, Suffolk bred, but our standing house is at Hocklye i'th' Hole, and Layton-buzzard.  For your father, no doubt you may from him claim titles of worship, but I cannot describe it; I think his ancestors came first from Hell-bree in Wales, cousin.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEVIL.  No matter whence we do derive our name:<br>  All Brittany shall ring of Merlin's fame,<br>  And wonder at his acts.  Go hence to Wales,<br>  There live a while; there Vortiger the king<br>  Builds castles and strong holds, which cannot stand,<br>  Unless supported by yong Merlins hand.<br>  There shall thy fame begin: wars are a breeding;<br>  The Saxons practise treason, yet unseen,<br>  Which shortly shall break out.--Fair love, farewel;<br>  Dear son and brother, here must I leave you all,<br>  Yet still I will be near at Merlins call.

How now, uncle? why do you search your pockets so?  Do you miss any thing?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Ha!  Cousin Merlin, I hope your beard does not overgrow your honesty; I pray, remember, you are made up of sisters thread; I am your mothers brother, whosoever was your father.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Why, wherein can you task my duty, uncle?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Your self or your page it must be, I have kept no other company, since your mother bound your head to my protectorship; I do feel a fault of one side; either it was that sparrowhawk, or a cast of Merlins, for I finde a covy of cardecu's sprung out of my pocket.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Why, do you want any money, uncle?  Sirrah, had you any from him?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Deny it not, for my pockets are witness against you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPIRIT.  Yes, I had, to teach you better wit to look to it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Pray, use your fingers better, and my wit may serve as it is, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Well, restore it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPIRIT.  There it is.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  I, there's some honesty in this; 'twas a token from your invisible father, cousin, which I would not have to go invisibly from me agen.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Well, you are sure you have it now, uncle?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Yes, and mean to keep it now from your pages filching fingers too.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPIRIT.  If you have it so sure, pray show it me agen.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Yes, my little juggler, I dare show it.  Ha, cleanly conveyance agen! ye have no invisible fingers, have ye?  'Tis gone, certainly.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPIRIT.  Why, sir, I toucht you not.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Why, look you, uncle, I have it now: how ill do you look to it! here, keep it safer.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Ha, ha, this is fine, yfaith.  I must keep some other company, if you have these slights of hand.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Come, come, uncle, 'tis all my art, which shall not offend you, sir, onely I give you a taste of it to show you sport.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Oh, but 'tis ill jesting with a mans pocket, tho'.  But I am glad to see you cunning, cousin, for now will I warrant thee a living till thou diest.  You have heard the news in Wales here?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Uncle, let me prevent your care and counsel,<br>  'Twill give you better knowledge of my cunning.<br>  You would prefer me now, in hope of gain,<br>  To Vortiger, King of the Welch Brittains,<br>  To whom are all the artists summon'd now,<br>  That seeks the secrets of futurity:<br>  The bards, the druids, wizards, conjurers,<br>  Not an auraspex with his whisling spells,<br>  No capnomanster with his musty fumes,<br>  No witch or juggler, but is thither sent,<br>  To calculate the strange and fear'd event<br>  Of his prodigious castle, now in building,<br>  Where all the labors of the painful day<br>  Are ruin'd still i'th' night, and to this place<br>  You would have me go.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Well, if thy mother were not my sister, I would say she was a witch that begot thee; but this is thy father, not thy mother wit.  Thou hast taken my tale into thy mouth, and spake my thoughts before me; therefore away, shuffle thy self amongst the conjurers, and be a made man before thou comest to age.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Nay, but stay, uncle, you overslip my dangers:<br>  The prophecies and all the cunning wizards<br>  Have certifi'd the king that this his castle<br>  Can never stand, till the foundation's laid<br>  With mortar temper'd with the fatal blood<br>  Of such a childe whose father was no mortal.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  What's this to thee?  If the devil were thy father, was not thy mother born at Carmarden?  Diggon for that, then; and then it must be a childes blood, and who will take thee for a childe with such a beard of thy face?  Is there not diggon for that too, cousin?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  I must not go: lend me your ear a while,<br>  I'le give you reasons to the contrary.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter two Gentlemen</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  Sure, this is an endless piece of work the king has sent us about!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 GENTLEMAN.  Kings may do it, man; the like has been done to finde out the unicorn.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  Which will be sooner found, I think, then this fiend begotten childe we seek for.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 GENTLEMAN.  Pox of those conjurers that would speak of such a one, and yet all their cunning could not tell us where to finde him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  In Wales they say assuredly he lives; come, let's enquire further.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Uncle, your perswasions must not prevail with me: I know mine enemies better then you do.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  I say, th'art a bastard then, if thou disobey thine uncle: was not Joan Go-too't, thy mother, my sister?  If the devil were thy father, what kin art thou to any man alive but bailys and brokers? and they are but brothers in law to thee neither.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  How's this?  I think we shall speed here.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 GENTLEMAN.  I, and unlook't for too: go ne're and listen to them.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Hast thou a beard to hide it? wil't thou show thy self a childe? wil't thou have more hair then wit?  Wil't thou deny thy mother, because no body knows thy father?  Or shall thine uncle be an ass?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  Bless ye, friend: pray, what call you this small gentlemans name?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Small, sir? a small man may be a great gentleman; his father may be of an ancient house, for ought we know, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 GENTLEMAN.  Why? do you not know his father?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  No, nor you neither, I think, unless the devil be in ye.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  What is his name, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  His name is my cousin, sir, his education is my sisters son, but his maners are his own.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Why ask ye, gentlemen? my name is Merlin.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Yes, and a goshawk was his father, for ought we know; for I am sure his mother was a wind-sucker.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 GENTLEMAN.  He has a mother, then?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  As sure as I have a sister, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  But his father you leave doubtful.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Well, sir, as wise men as you doubt whether he had a father or no?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  Sure, this is he we seek for.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 GENTLEMAN.  I think no less: and, sir, we let you know<br>  The king hath sent for you.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  The more childe he; and he had bin rul'd by me,<br>  He should have gone before he was sent for.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  May we not see his mother?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Yes, and feel her too, if you anger her; a devilish thing, I can tell ye, she has been.  Ile go fetch her to ye.     [<i> Exit</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 GENTLEMAN.  Sir, it were fit you did resolve for speed,<br>  You must unto the king.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.              My service, sir,<br>  Shall need no strict command, it shall obey<br>  Most peaceably; but needless 'tis to fetch<br>  What is brought home: my journey may be staid,<br>  The king is coming hither<br>  With the same quest you bore before him; hark,<br>  This drum will tell ye.     [<i> Within drums beat a low march</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GENTLEMAN.  This is some cunning indeed, sir.<br>  <br>  <i> Florish</i> .<i>   Enter Vortiger, reading a letter, Proximus, with drum and Soldiers, etc</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  Still in our eye your message, Proximus,<br>  We keep to spur our speed:<br>  Ostorius and Octa we shall salute<br>  With succor against Prince Uter and Aurelius,<br>  Whom now we hear incamps at Winchester.<br>  There's nothing interrupts our way so much<br>  As doth the erection of this fatal castle,<br>  That spite of all our art and daily labor,<br>  The night still ruines.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROXIMUS.  As erst I did affirm, still I maintain,<br>  The fiend begotten childe must be found out,<br>  Whose blood gives strength to the foundation;<br>  It cannot stand else.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Clown and Joan, Merlin</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.           Ha!  Is't so?<br>  Then, Proximus, by this intelligence<br>  He should be found: speak, is this he you tell of?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Yes, sir, and I his uncle, and she his mother.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  And who is his father?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Why, she, his mother, can best tell you that, and yet I think the childe be wise enough, for he has found his father.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  Woman, is this thy son?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  It is, my lord.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  What was his father?  Or where lives he?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Mother, speak freely and unastonisht;<br>  That which you dar'd to act, dread not to name.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  In which I shall betray my sin and shame.<br>  But since it must be so, then know, great king,<br>  All that my self yet knows of him is this:<br>  In pride of blood and beauty I did live,<br>  My glass the altar was, my face the idol;<br>  Such was my peevish love unto my self,<br>  That I did hate all other; such disdain<br>  Was in my scornful eye that I suppos'd<br>  No mortal creature worthy to enjoy me.<br>  Thus with the peacock I beheld my train,<br>  But never saw the blackness of my feet;<br>  Oft have I chid the winds for breathing on me,<br>  And curst the sun, fearing to blast my beauty.<br>  In midst of this most leaprous disease,<br>  A seeming fair yong man appear'd unto me,<br>  In all things suiting my aspiring pride,<br>  And with him brought along a conquering power,<br>  To which my frailty yielded; from whose embraces<br>  This issue came; what more he is, I know not.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  Some incubus or spirit of the night<br>  Begot him then, for, sure, no mortal did it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  No matter who, my lord; leave further quest,<br>  Since 'tis as hurtful as unnecessary<br>  More to enquire: go to the cause, my lord,<br>  Why you have sought me thus?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  I doubt not but thou knowst; yet, to be plain,<br>  I sought thee for thy blood.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  By whose direction?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROXIMUS.  By mine;<br>  My art infalable instructed me,<br>  Upon thy blood must the foundation rise<br>  Of the kings building; it cannot stand else.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Hast thou such leisure to enquire my fate,<br>  And let thine own hang careless over thee?<br>  Knowst thou what pendelous mischief roofs thy head,<br>  How fatal, and how sudden?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROXIMUS.  Pish!<br>  Bearded abortive, thou foretel my danger!<br>  My lord, He trifles to delay his own.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  No, I yield my self: and here before the king<br>  Make good thine augury, as I shall mine.<br>  If thy fate fall not, thou hast spoke all truth,<br>  And let my blood satisfie the kings desires:<br>  If thou thy self wilt write thine epitaph,<br>  Dispatch it quickly, there's not a minutes time<br>  'Twixt thee and thy death.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROXIMUS.  Ha, ha, ha!     [<i> A stone falls and kills Proximus</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  I, so thou mayest die laughing.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  Ha!  This is above admiration: look, is he dead?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Yes, sir, here's brains to make morter on, if you'l use them.  Cousin Merlin, there's no more of this stone fruit ready to fall, is there?  I pray, give your uncle a little fair warning.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Remove that shape of death.  And now, my lord,<br>  For clear satisfaction of your doubts,<br>  Merlin will show the fatal cause that keeps<br>  Your castle down and hinders your proceedings.<br>  Stand there, and by an apparition see<br>  The labor and end of all your destiny.<br>  Mother and uncle, you must be absent.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Is your father coming, cousin?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Nay, you must be gone.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JOAN.  Come, you'l offend him, brother.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  I would fain see my brother i'law; if you were married, I might lawfully call him so.<br>  <i> Merlin strikes his wand</i> .<i>   Thunder and lightning; two dragons appear, a white and a red; they fight a while, and pause</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.

I shall: heaven be auspicious to us.<br>  <i> Thunder: the two dragons fight agen, and the white dragon drives off the red</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  The conquest is on the white dragons part.<br>  Now, Merlin, faithfully expound the meaning.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Your grace must then not be offended with me.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VORTIGER.  It is the weakest part I found in thee,<br>  To doubt of me so slightly.  Shall I blame<br>  My prophet that foretells me of my dangers?<br>  Thy cunning I approve most excellent.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.

The kingdom<br>  Which thou usurp'st, thou most unhappy tyrant,<br>  Is leaving thee; the Saxons which thou broughtst<br>  To back thy usurpations, are grown great,<br>  And where they seat themselves, do hourly seek<br>  To blot the records of old Brute and Brittains<br>  From memory of men, calling themselves<br>  Hingest-men, and Hingest-land, that no more<br>  The Brittain name be known: all this by thee,<br>  Thou base destroyer of thy native countrey.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Edol</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  What, stand you talking?     [<i> Fight</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Hold, Edol.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Hold out, my sword,<br>  And listen not to king or princes word;<br>  There's work enough abroad, this task is mine.     [<i> Alarum</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Prosper thy valour, as thy vertues shine.     [<i> Exeunt</i> .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <center>SCENE IV</center> <br>  <br>  <i> Enter Cador and Edwin</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Bright victory her self fights on our part,<br>  And, buckled in a golden beaver, rides<br>  Triumphantly before us.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  Justice is with her,<br>  Who ever takes the true and rightful cause.<br>  Let us not lag behinde them.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Prince</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Here comes the prince.  How goes our fortunes, sir?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Hopeful and fair, brave Cador.<br>  Proud Vortiger, beat down by Edols sword,<br>  Was rescu'd by the following multitudes,<br>  And now for safety's fled unto a castle<br>  Here standing on the hill: but I have sent<br>  A cry of hounds as violent as hunger,<br>  To break his stony walls; or, if they fail,<br>  We'l send in wilde fire to dislodge him thence,<br>  Or burn them all with flaming violence.     [<i> Exeunt</i> .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <center>SCENE V</center> <br>  <br>  <i> Blazing star appears</i> .<br>  <br>  <i> Florish tromp</i> .<i>   Enter Prince Uter, Edol, Cador, Edwin, Toclio, with drum and Soldiers</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Look, Edol:<br>  Still this fiery exalation shoots<br>  His frightful horrors on th'amazed world;<br>  See, in the beam that's 'bout his flaming ring,<br>  A dragons head appears, from our whose mouth<br>  Two flaming flakes of fire stretch east and west.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  And see, from forth the body of the star<br>  Seven smaller blazing streams directly point<br>  On this affrighted kingdom.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  'Tis a dreadful meteor.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  And doth portend strange fears.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  This is no crown of peace; this angry fire<br>  Hath something more to burn then Vortiger;<br>  If it alone were pointed at his fall,<br>  It would pull in his blasing piramids<br>  And be appeas'd, for Vortiger is dead.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  These never come without their large effects.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  The will of heaven be done! our sorrow's this,<br>  We want a mistick Pithon to expound<br>  This fiery oracle.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.         Oh no, my lord,<br>  You have the best that ever Brittain bred;<br>  And durst I prophecy of your prophet, sir,<br>  None like him shall succeed him.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  You mean Merlin?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  True, sir, wonderous Merlin;<br>  He met us in the way, and did foretell<br>  The fortunes of this day successful to us.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  He's sure about the camp; send for him, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  He told the bloody Vortiger his fate,<br>  And truely too, and if I could give faith<br>  To any wizards skill, it should be Merlin.<br>  <br>  <i> Enter Merlin and Clown</i> .<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  And see, my lord, as if to satisfie<br>  Your highness pleasure, Merlin is come.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  See,<br>  The comet's in his eye, disturb him not.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  With what a piercing judgement he beholds it!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Whither will heaven and fate translate this kingdom?<br>  What revolutions, rise and fall of nations<br>  Is figur'd yonder in that star, that sings<br>  The change  of Brittians state and death of kings?<br>  Ha!  He's dead already; how swiftly mischief creeps!<br>  Thy fatal end, sweet prince, even Merlin weeps.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  He does foresee  some evil, his action shows it,<br>  For, e're he does expound, he weeps the story.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  There's another weeps too.  Sirrah, dost thou understand what thou lamentst for?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  No, sir, I am his uncle, and weep because my cousin weeps; flesh and blood cannot forbear.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Gentle Merlin, speak thy prophetick knowledge<br>  In explanation of this fiery horror,<br>  From which we gather from thy mounful tears<br>  Much sorrow and disaster in it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  'Tis true,<br>  Fair prince, but you must hear the rest with patience.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  I vow I will, tho' it portend my ruine.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  There's no such fear.<br>  This brought the fiery fall of Vortiger,<br>  And yet not him alone: this day is faln<br>  A king more good, the glory of our land,<br>  The milde and gentle, sweet Aurelius.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Our brother!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDWIN.  Forefend it heaven!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  He at his palace royal, sir,<br>  At Winchester, this day is dead and poison'd.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  By whom?  Or what means, Merlin?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  By the traiterous Saxons.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  I ever fear'd as much: that devil Ostorius<br>  And the damn'd witch Artesia, sure, has done it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Poison'd! oh, look further, gentle Merlin,<br>  Behold the star agen, and do but finde<br>  Revenge for me, though it cost thousand lives,<br>  And mine the foremost.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Comfort your self, the heavens have given it fully:<br>  All the portentious ills to you is told.<br>  Now hear a happy story, sir, from me<br>  To you and to your fair posterity.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Me thinks, I see something like a peel'd onion; it makes me weep agen.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Be silent, uncle, you'l be forc't else.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Can you not finde in the star, cousin, whether I can hold my tongue or no?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Yes, I must cut it out.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Phu, you speak without book, sir, my cousin Merlin knows.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  True, I must tie it up.  Now speak your pleasure, uncle.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Hum, hum, hum, hum.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  So, so.--<br>  Now observe, my lord, and there behold,<br>  Above yon flame-hair'd beam that upward shoots,<br>  Appears a dragons head, out of whose mouth<br>  Two streaming lights point their flame-feather'd darts<br>  Contrary ways, yet both shall have their aims:<br>  Again behold, from the ignifirent body<br>  Seven splendant and illustrious rays are spred,<br>  All speaking heralds to this Brittain isle,<br>  And thus they are expounded:  The dragons head<br>  Is the herogliphick that figures out<br>  Your princely self, that here must reign a king;<br>  Those by-form'd fires that from the dragons mouth<br>  Shoot east and west, emblem two royal babes,<br>  Which shall proceed from you, a son and daughter.<br>  Her pointed constellation, northwest bending,<br>  Crowns her a queen in Ireland, of whom first springs<br>  That kingdoms title to the Brittain kings.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Hum, hum, hum.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  But of your son thus fate and Merlin tells:<br>  All after times shall fill their chronicles<br>  With fame of his renown, whose warlike sword<br>  Shall pass through fertile France and Germany;<br>  Nor shall his conquering foot be forc't to stand,<br>  Till Romes imperial wreath hath crown'd his fame<br>  With monarch of the west, from whose seven hills,<br>  With conquest and contributory kings,<br>  He back returns to inlarge the Brittain bounds,<br>  His heraldry adorn'd with thirteen crowns.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Hum, hum, hum.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  He to the world shall add another Worthy,<br>  And, as a loadstone, for his prowess draw<br>  A train of marshal lovers to his court:<br>  It shall be then the best of knight-hoods honor,<br>  At Winchester to fill his castle hall,<br>  And at his royal table sit and feast<br>  In warlike orders, all their arms round hurl'd,<br>  As if they meant to circumscribe the world.  [<i> He touches the Clowns mouth with his wand</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Hum, hum, hum: oh, that I could speak a little!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  I know your mind, uncle; agen be silent.     [<i> Strikes agen</i> .<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Thou speakst of wonders, Merlin; prithee, go on,<br>  Declare at full this constellation.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Those seven beams pointing downward, sir, betoken<br>  The troubles of this land, which then shall meet<br>  With other fate: war and dissension strives<br>  To make division, till seven kings agree<br>  To draw this kingdom to a hepterchy.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Thine art hath made such proof that we believe<br>  Thy words authentical: be ever neer us,<br>  My prophet and the guide of all my actions.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  My service shall be faithful to your person,<br>  And all my studies for my countries safety.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Hum, hum, hum.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Come, you are releast, sir.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Cousin, pray, help me to my tongue agen; you do not mean I shall be dumb still, I hope?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  Why, hast thou not thy tongue?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOWN.  Ha! yes, I feel it now, I was so long dumb, I could not well tell whether I spake or no.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Is't thy advice we presently pursue<br>  The bloody Saxons, that have slain my brother?<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MERLIN.  With your best speed, my lord;<br>  Prosperity will keep you company.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CADOR.  Take, then, your title with you, royal prince,<br>  'Twill adde unto our strength: long live King Uter!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Put the addition to't that heaven hath given you:<br>  The dragon is your emblem, bear it bravely,<br>  And so live long and ever happy, styl'd<br>  Uter-Pendragon, lawful king of Brittain.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRINCE.  Thanks, Edol, we imbrace the name and title,<br>  And in our sheild and standard shall the figure<br>  Of a red dragon still be born before us,<br>  To fright the bloody Saxons.  Oh, my Aurelius,<br>  Sweet rest thy soul; let thy disturbed spirit<br>  Expect revenge; think what it would, it hath:<br>  The dragon's coming in his fiery wrath.

Stay, noble Gloster:<br>  That monster first must be expel'd our eye,<br>  Or we shall take no joy in it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DONOBERT.  If that be hindrance, give her quick judgement,<br>  And send her hence to death; she has long deserv'd it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDOL.  Let my sentence stand for all: take her hence,<br>  And stake her carcase in the burning sun,<br>  Till it be parcht and dry, and then fley off<br>  Her wicked skin, and stuff the pelt with straw<br>  To be shown up and down at fairs and markets:<br>  Two pence a piece to see so foul a monster<br>  Will be a fair monopoly, and worth the begging.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTESIA.
