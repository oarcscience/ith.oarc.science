JAMES YEAMES</h2>  <br>  <b> Cast of Characters</b> </center>  <br>  KING ARTHUR. <br>  GARETH, youngest son of King Lot and Queen Bellicent. <br>  LANCELOT.<br>  SIR KAY, the Seneschal. <br>  THE ANCIENT, a Seer. <br>  GAWAIN, brother of Gareth. <br>  BELLICENT, mother of Gareth. <br>  PRINCE LLWELLYN, a child. <br>  LYONORS, maiden held in Castle Perilous. <br>  LYNETTE, her sister. <br>  A WIDOW AND HER KINSMAN. <br>  MORS, the boy disguised as Death. <br>  THE KING'S JESTER. <br>  THE KING'S PAGE. <br>  KNIGHTS, MESSENGERS, ETC. <br>  <br>  <center>SCENE I<br>  <br>  HOME OF GARETH.</center> <br>  (Bellicent arranging coverlet over her husband, who is lying before the hearth. Child seated on the floor, playing with helmet and sword.) <br>  <br>  <b> BELLICENT.</b> <br>  Ah me! The very babes are smitten with the love of strife, and sword and helmet are the children's toys! <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he lies there, my husband and a king; lies like a log, and all but smouldered out! For, ever since - when traitor to the king - he found against him in the barons' war, and Arthur gave him back his territory - his age has slowly drooped, and now he lies, listless and lifeless, though not ready for the tomb.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my two sons, Modred and Gawain, are the king's knights; while now the last, - the youngest and the dearest, - would away to Arthur's Hall.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long have I held him, as a hound in leash; but the hour comes, I know, when from my home, my heart, Gareth, my best beloved will break away.<br>  <br>  (Child tries to put on helmet, and lets it fall clattering on the sword. Looks up and sees Queen.)<br>  <br>  <b> CHILD.</b> <br>  My Lady Queen, I fain would be thy knight, for thou art sad. Who does thee wrong? (Grasps sword.)<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Hush little one, and be in leed my knight, - a carpet-knight and stay at home with me. For soon there wil be none but thou and I. I know thy cousin yearneth to be gone, and soon Gareth -<br>  <br>  <b> CHILD.</b> <br>  Gareth? And goeth he to the court? and will he see the King? And have you seen great Arthur?<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Aye, child. For I was near him when he sat crowned on the dais; and his warriors cried, "Be thou the king, and we will work thy will, who love thee!"<br>  <br>  <b> CHILD.</b> <br>  And thou hast been to Camelot?<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Yes, child. And there saw Mage Merlin, whose vast wit and hundred winters are but as slaves to serve the king. And there the white-robed Lady of the Lake, who gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword, who lives down in the lake's calm deeps, and sometimes walks the water, - like our LORD.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, likewise, I beheld Excalibur, the sword that rose from out the bosom of the lake; and Arthur rowed across and took it; rich with jewels on the hilt, bewildering heart and eye; the blade so bright that men are blinded by it.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But child, the hour is late. (Voice without calls, "Llewellyn, Llewellyn!") Hark, thy nurse is calling thee! Hasten, sweet one, - to bed and pleasant dreams! (Embraces him.)<br>  <br>  (Exit Bellicent and child. Stage darkened, Bellicent returns, bearing a lighted candle, looks at Lot and sighs. Moves towards chair. Enter Gareth. Bellicent sits, Gareth at her feet.)<br>  <br>  <b> GARETH.</b> <br>  Mother, tho' ye count me still the child, sweet mother, do ye love the child?<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  (Laughing.) Thou art but a wild-goose to question it.<br>  <br>  <b> GAR.</b> <br>  Then, mother, as ye love the child, being a goose and rather tame than wild, hear the child's story.<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Yea, my well-beloved, an t'were but of the goose and golden eggs!<br>  <br>  <b> GAR.</b> <br>  Nay, nay, good mother, but this egg of mine was finer than any goose can lay. For this an eagle, - a royal eagle laid<br>  Almost 'yond reach of eye, on such a palm<br>  As glitters gilded in thy Book of Hours.<br>  And there was ever haunting round the palm<br>  A lusty youth but poor, who often saw<br>  The splendor sparkling from aloft, and thought,<br>  An I could climb and lay my hand upon it,<br>  Then were I wealthier than a leash of kings.<br>  But ever when he reached a hand to climb<br>  One that had loved him from his childhood caught<br>  And stayed him, "Climb not lest thou break thy neck,<br>  I charge thee by my love." And so they boy,<br>  Sweet mother, neither climbed nor brake his neck,<br>  But brake his very heart in pining for it.<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Hast thou no pity on my loneliness?<br>  See, where thy father, Lot, beside the hearth<br>  Lies prone, nor hears, nor speaks, nor knows;<br>  And both thy brethren are in Arthur's Hall -<br>  Albeit neither loved with that full love.<br>  I feel for thee.<br>  Stay therefore thou. Follow the deer,<br>  By these tall firs and our fast falling burns,<br>  So make thy manhood mightier day by day!<br>  Stay, my best son, ye are yet more boy than man.<br>  <br>  <b> GAR.</b>  O mother, how can ye keep me tethered to you?<br>  Man am I grown, a man's work must I do.<br>  Follow the deer? Follow Christ, the King,<br>  Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King -<br>  Else wherefore born?<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Sweet son there be those who deem him not,<br>  Or will not deem him wholly proven king.<br>  Say, wilt thou leave<br>  Thine easeful biding here and risk thine all,<br>  Life, limbs, for one that is not proven king?<br>  <br>  <b> GAR.</b> <br>  Not proven? Who swept the dust of ruined Rome<br>  From off the threshold of the realm, and crushed<br>  The idolaters, and made the people free!<br>  Who should be king save him who makes us free?<br>  Yield me, my mother! your full leave to go.<br>  Mother, to gain it, I would walk through fire!<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Will ye walk thro' fire?<br>  Who walks thro' fire will hardly heed the smoke.<br>  Ay, go then, an ye must. Only, one proof,<br>  Before thou ask the king to make thee knight,<br>  Of thine obedience and thy love to me,<br>  Thy mother, - I demand.<br>  <br>  <b> GAR.</b> <br>  A hard one or a hundred, so I go!<br>  Nay - quick! The proof to prove me to the quick!<br>  <br>  <b> BELL.</b> <br>  Prince, thou shalt go disguised to Arthur's hall,<br>  And hire thyself to serve for meats and drinks<br>  Among the scullions and the kitchen knaves,<br>  Nor shalt thou tell thy name to any one.<br>  And thou shalt serve a twelvemonth and a day.<br>  <br>  <b> GAR.</b> <br>  The thrall in person may be free in soul;<br>  And I shall see the jousts. Thy son am I,<br>  And, since thou art my mother, must obey.<br>  I therefore yield me freely to thy will;<br>  For hence will I, disguised, and hire myself<br>  To serve with scullions and with kitchen knaves;<br>  Nor tell my name to any-no, not e'en the king.<br>  <br>  <center>EXEUNT</center>  <br>  <br>  <center>SCENE II<br>  <br>  BEFORE CAMELOT CASTLE.<br>  <br>  (Enter Lancelot and Kay.)</center> <br>  <b> LANCELOT.</b> <br>  Sit down, Sir Kay, and breathe the enlivening air, and rest thyself a while. Moreover, I would hear thee tell of the Coming of Arthur.<br>  <br>  <b> KAY.</b> <br>  'Tis said, that when King Uther died, Merlin and Bleys, soothsayers both, saw on the sea a dragon-ship, all bright from stem to stern with shining people on the decks.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they watched the great sea fall, wave after wave, - each mightier than the last, - a ninth wave, full of voices, rose and plunged, roaring, and all the wave was in a flame.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the wave and in the flame was borne a naked babe, floating to Merlin's feet. Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried, "The King! Here is an heir for Uther!"<br>  <br>  <b> LANCE.</b> <br>  But when I met Merlin and asked him if these things be truth - the shining dragon-ship and naked child, descending in the glory of the seas, - he laughed as is his wont, and answered me in riddling triplets of old time, and said:<br>  <center>"Rain, rain, and sun!<br>  A rainbow in the sky,<br>  A young man will be wiser by and by,<br>  An old man's wit may wander ere he die!"</center>  <br>  <b> KAY.</b> <br>  Ha ha! That sounds like Merlin. But truth to tell; - Arthur was born after his father's death, within the castle by the Cornish sea. And, all as soon as born, delivered at a secret postern-gate to Merlin; to be holden far apart until his hour should come. Because the lords of that fierce day had surely torn the child piece-meal among them had they known, for each but sought to rule for his own self and hand.<br>  <br>  <b> LANCE.</b> <br>  Ah well, I ever held great Arthur king! Did I not see him throw the kings of Erin, Wales, and Orkney, - till, like a painted battle, the war stood silenced, - the living quiet as the dead.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he turned to me and laughing said: "Thou dost not doubt me king, for well thine arm hath wrought for me today."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, and my liege," I cried, "the fire of God descends upon thee in the battlefield. I know the for my king."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat we twain, for each had warded either in the fight, sware on the field of death a deathless love.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But come, let's seek the hall, for, seems to me, I hear the sound of footsteps nigh at hand.<br>  <br>  <b> KAY.</b> <br>  Aye, aye! And I must to my knaves and scullions and bid the villain-vassals to their work again - for if their fire be low 'twill kindle mine!<br>  <br>  <center>(Enter Gareth and two companions.)</center> <br>  <b> FIRST COMP.</b> <br>  Let us go no further, Lord. Here is a city of enchanters, built by fairy kings!<br>  <br>  <b> SECOND COMP.</b> <br>  Lord, we have heard from our wise men at home to northward, that this king, is not the King, but only changeling out of Fairyland who drave the heathen hence by sorcery and Merlin's glamour.<br>  <br>  <b> FIRST COMP.</b> <br>  Lord, there is no such city anywhere. 'Tis all a vision!<br>  <br>  <b> GARETH.</b> <br>  Pshaw! Have I not enough glamour<br>  In my own blood, my princedom, youth and hopes,<br>  To plunge old Merlin in the Arabian Sea!<br>  <br>  (They approach the gate. A long bearded aged man appears.)<br>  <br>  <b> SEER.</b> <br>  Who be ye, my sons?<br>  <br>  <b> GARETH.</b> <br>  We be tillers of the soil,<br>  Who leaving share in furrow come to see<br>  The glories of our king: but these, my men, -<br>  Your city moved so weirdly in the mist -<br>  Doubt if the king be king at all, or come<br>  From Fairyland, and whether this be built,<br>  By magic, and by fairy kings and queens,<br>  Or whether there be any city at all,<br>  Or all a vision.<br>  <br>  <b> SEER.</b> <br>  Son, truly as thou sayest, a fairy king<br>  And fairy queens have built the city.<br>  They came from out a sacred mountain-cleft<br>  Toward the sunrise, each with harp in hand,<br>  And built it to the music of their harps.<br>  And, as thou sayest, it is enchanted, son;<br>  For there is nothing in it as it seems<br>  Saving the king; tho' some there be that hold<br>  The king, a shadow and the city real.<br>  Yet take thou heed of him, for, so thou pass<br>  Beneath this archway, then wilt thou become<br>  A thrall to his enchantments. For the king<br>  Will bind thee by such vows as is a shame<br>  A man should not be bound by, yet the which<br>  No man can keep. But, so thou dread to swear,<br>  Pass not beneath this gateway, but abide<br>  Without, among the cattle of the field.<br>  <br>  <b> GARETH. </b> <br>  Old master, reverence thine own beard<br>  That looks as white as utter truth, and seems<br>  Well nigh as long as thou art statured tall!<br>  Why mockest thou the stranger that hath been<br>  To thee fair-spoken?<br>  <br>  <b> SEER.</b> <br>  I mock thee not but as thou mockest me,<br>  And all that see thee, for thou art not who<br>  Thou seemest, but I know thee who thou art.<br>  And now thou goest up to mock the king,<br>  Who cannot brook the shadow of any lie.<br>  <br>  <center>(Exit Seer.)</center>  <br>  <b> GARETH.</b> <br>  My men,<br>  Our one white lie sits like a little ghost<br>  Here on the threshold of our enterprise.<br>  Let love be blamed for it, - not she, nor I.<br>  Well, we will make amends.<br>  <br>  <center>(They enter the gate.)</center> <br>  <br>  <br>  <center>SCENE III<br>  <br>  THRONE ROOM OF CAMELOT CASTLE.</center> <br>  <br>  (Enter Arthur attended by Page and Jester and knights. The king takes seat on throne.)<br>  <br>  <center>(Enter Widow.)</center> <br>  <b> WIDOW.</b> <br>  A boon, Sir King! Thine enemy am I, and loathe to ask thee aught.<br>  Yet lo! my husband's brother had my son<br>  Thralled in his castle, and hath starved him dead,<br>  And seized upon that goodly heritage<br>  Which thou that slewest the sire hadst left the son.<br>  Grant me some knight to do the battle for me,<br>  Kill the foul thief, and wreak me for my son.<br>  <br>  <b> KINSMAN.</b> <br>  A boon, Sir King! I am her kinsman, I, - <br>  Give me to right her wrong, and slay the man.<br>  <br>  <b> KAY.</b> <br>  A boon, Sir King! E'en that thou grant her none,<br>  This railer, that hath mocked thee in full hall -<br>  None, or the wholesome boon of gyve and gag!<br>  <br>  <b> JESTER.</b> <br>  "Gyve and gag!" Poor old Kay! He must have a pain somewhere. Sir King, I would fain ask thee a riddle.<br>  <br>  <b> KING.</b> <br>  Say on. Thou art a fool, but fools are sometimes wiser than the wise. Moreover, thou mayest relieve the Seneschal of his pain.<br>  <br>  <b> JESTER.</b> <br>  Suppose then, Sir Pendragon, this doughty kinsman going on his quest, were to be seized with a fit of colic on the way, - Where and When would it take him?<br>  <br>  <b> KING.</b>  (Repeats question.)<br>  Faith, I know not! Sir Kay, canst thou tell?<br>  <br>  <b> KAY.</b> <br>  Nay, verily. I vex me not with such fool questions.<br>  <br>  <center>(Knights murmur, asking each other the riddle.)</center> <br>  <b> KING.</b> <br>  Well Sir Jeffrey, and when and where would the colic attack the warrior?<br>  <br>  <b> JESTER.</b> <br>  In the middle of the (k)night of course!<br>  <br>  <center>(Laughter.)</center> <br>  <b> KAY.</b> <br>  Ha, ha, ha! I would like to see him doubled up. (Points to long slender knight.) He is too long as it is. But, Sir King, grant him no boon.<br>  <br>  <b> KING.</b> <br>  We sit King, to help the wrong'd<br>  Thro' all our realm. The woman loves her lord.<br>  Peace to thee, woman, with thy loves and hate!<br>  The kings of old had doomed thee to the flames.<br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But get thee hence -<br>  Lest that rough humor of the kings of old<br>  Return upon me! Thou that art her kin,<br>  Go likewise; lay him low and slay him not,<br>  But bring him here, that I may judge the right,<br>  According to the justice of the King:<br>  Then, be he guilty, by that deathless King<br>  Who lived and died for men, the man shall die.<br>  <br>  <center>(Exit Widow and Kinsman.)</center> <br>  <b> KING.</b> <br>  Go, Jeffrey, lad, and get thy lute.<br>  I would thou'dst cheer me with a song. Sir Kay, in sooth, is sound and wholesome as an apple, - but like an apple plucked too soon, he's somewhat sour.<br>  <br>  <b> JESTER.</b> <br>  Enough to give one colic in the middle of the knight!<br>  <br>  <center>(Fetches lute and sings.)</center> <br>  <br>  <center>SONG OF THE KING'S JESTER.</center> <br>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
