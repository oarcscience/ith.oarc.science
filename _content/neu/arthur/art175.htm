Early, one fair dawn,<br>  The light-winged spirit of his youth returned<br>  On Arthur's heart; he armed himself and went,<br>  So coming to the fountain-side beheld<br>  Balin and Balan sitting statuelike,<br>  Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down,<br>  From underneath a plume of lady-fern,<br>  Sang, and the sand danced at the bottom of it.<br>  And on the right of Balin Balin's horse<br>  Was fast beside an alder, on the left<br>  Of Balan Balan's near a poplartree.<br>  "Fair Sirs," said Arthur, "wherefore sit ye here?" <br>  Balin and Balan answered "For the sake<br>  Of glory; we be mightier men than all<br>  In Arthur's court; that also have we proved;<br>  For whatsoever knight against us came<br>  Or I or he have easily overthrown."<br>  "I too," said Arthur, "am of Arthur's hall,<br>  But rather proven in his Paynim wars<br>  Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not,<br>  Whether me likewise ye can overthrow."<br>  And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down,<br>  And lightly so returned, and no man knew.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Balin rose, and Balan, and beside<br>  The carolling water set themselves again,<br>  And spake no word until the shadow turned;<br>  When from the fringe of coppice round them burst<br>  A spangled pursuivant, and crying, "Sirs,<br>  Rise, follow! ye be sent for by the King,"<br>  They followed; whom when Arthur seeing asked<br>  "Tell me your names; why sat ye by the well?"<br>  Balin the stillness of a minute broke<br>  Saying "An unmelodious name to thee,<br>  Balin, 'the Savage'--that addition thine--<br>  My brother and my better, this man here,<br>  Balan. I smote upon the naked skull<br>  A thrall of thine in open hall, my hand<br>  Was gauntleted, half slew him; for I heard<br>  He had spoken evil of me; thy just wrath<br>  Sent me a three-years' exile from thine eyes.<br>  I have not lived my life delightsomely:<br>  For I that did that violence to thy thrall,<br>  Had often wrought some fury on myself,<br>  Saving for Balan: those three kingless years<br>  Have past--were wormwood-bitter to me.  King,<br>  Methought that if we sat beside the well,<br>  And hurled to ground what knight soever spurred<br>  Against us, thou would'st take me gladlier back,<br>  And make, as ten-times worthier to be thine<br>  Than twenty Balins, Balan knight. I have said.<br>  Not so--not all. A man of thine today<br>  Abashed us both, and brake my boast. Thy will?"<br>  Said Arthur "Thou hast ever spoken truth;<br>  Thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie.<br>  Rise, my true knight. As children learn, be thou<br>  Wiser for falling! walk with me, and move<br>  To music with thine Order and the King.<br>  Thy chair, a grief to all the brethren, stands<br>  Vacant, but thou retake it, mine again!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, when Sir Balin entered hall,<br>  The Lost one Found was greeted as in Heaven<br>  With joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth<br>  Of leaf, and gayest garlandage of flowers,<br>  Along the walls and down the board; they sat,<br>  And cup clashed cup; they drank and some one sang,<br>  Sweet-voiced, a song of welcome, whereupon<br>  Their common shout in chorus, mounting, made<br>  Those banners of twelve battles overhead<br>  Stir, as they stirred of old, when Arthur's host<br>  Proclaimed him Victor, and the day was won.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Balan added to their Order lived<br>  A wealthier life than heretofore with these<br>  And Balin, till their embassage returned.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir King" they brought report "we hardly found,<br>  So bushed about it is with gloom, the hall<br>  Of him to whom ye sent us, Pellam, once<br>  A Christless foe of thine as ever dashed<br>  Horse against horse; but seeing that thy realm<br>  Hath prospered in the name of Christ, the King<br>  Took, as in rival heat, to holy things;<br>  And finds himself descended from the Saint<br>  Arimathaean Joseph; him who first<br>  Brought the great faith to Britain over seas;<br>  He boasts his life as purer than thine own;<br>  Eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat;<br>  Hath pushed aside his faithful wife, nor lets<br>  Or dame or damsel enter at his gates<br>  Lest he should be polluted. This gray King<br>  Showed us a shrine wherein were wonders--yea--<br>  Rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom,<br>  Thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross,<br>  And therewithal (for thus he told us) brought<br>  By holy Joseph hither, that same spear<br>  Wherewith the Roman pierced the side of Christ.<br>  He much amazed us; after, when we sought<br>  The tribute, answered 'I have quite foregone<br>  All matters of this world: Garlon, mine heir,<br>  Of him demand it,' which this Garlon gave<br>  With much ado, railing at thine and thee.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when we left, in those deep woods we found<br>  A knight of thine spear-stricken from behind,<br>  Dead, whom we buried; more than one of us<br>  Cried out on Garlon, but a woodman there<br>  Reported of some demon in the woods<br>  Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues<br>  From all his fellows, lived alone, and came<br>  To learn black magic, and to hate his kind<br>  With such a hate, that when he died, his soul<br>  Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life<br>  Was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence,<br>  Strikes from behind. This woodman showed the cave<br>  From which he sallies, and wherein he dwelt.<br>  We saw the hoof-print of a horse, no more."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Arthur, "Let who goes before me, see<br>  He do not fall behind me: foully slain<br>  And villainously! who will hunt for me<br>  This demon of the woods?" Said Balan, "I"!<br>  So claimed the quest and rode away, but first,<br>  Embracing Balin, "Good my brother, hear!<br>  Let not thy moods prevail, when I am gone<br>  Who used to lay them! hold them outer fiends,<br>  Who leap at thee to tear thee; shake them aside,<br>  Dreams ruling when wit sleeps! yea, but to dream<br>  That any of these would wrong thee, wrongs thyself.<br>  Witness their flowery welcome. Bound are they<br>  To speak no evil. Truly save for fears,<br>  My fear for thee, so rich a fellowship<br>  Would make me wholly blest: thou one of them,<br>  Be one indeed: consider them, and all<br>  Their bearing in their common bond of love,<br>  No more of hatred than in Heaven itself,<br>  No more of jealousy than in Paradise."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Balan warned, and went; Balin remained:<br>  Who--for but three brief moons had glanced away<br>  From being knighted till he smote the thrall,<br>  And faded from the presence into years<br>  Of exile-- now would strictlier set himself<br>  To learn what Arthur meant by courtesy,<br>  Manhood, and knighthood; wherefore hovered round<br>  Lancelot, but when he marked his high sweet smile<br>  In passing, and a transitory word<br>  Make knight or churl or child or damsel seem<br>  From being smiled at happier in themselves--<br>  Sighed, as a boy lame-born beneath a height,<br>  That glooms his valley, sighs to see the peak<br>  Sun-flushed, or touch at night the northern star;<br>  For one from out his village lately climbed<br>  And brought report of azure lands and fair,<br>  Far seen to left and right; and he himself<br>  Hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet<br>  Up from the base: so Balin marvelling oft<br>  How far beyond him Lancelot seemed to move,<br>  Groaned, and at times would mutter, "These be gifts,<br>  Born with the blood, not learnable, divine,<br>  Beyond <i> my</i>  reach. Well had I foughten-- well--<br>  In those fierce wars, struck hard--and had I crowned<br>  With my slain self the heaps of whom I slew--<br>  So--better!-- But this worship of the Queen,<br>  That honour too wherein she holds him--this,<br>  This was the sunshine that hath given the man<br>  A growth, a name that branches o'er the rest,<br>  And strength against all odds, and what the King<br>  So prizes--overprizes--gentleness.<br>  Her likewise would I worship an I might.<br>  I never can be close with her, as he<br>  That brought her hither. Shall I pray the King<br>  To let me bear some token of his Queen<br>  Whereon to gaze, remembering her--forget<br>  My heats and violences? live afresh?<br>  What, if the Queen disdained to grant it! nay<br>  Being so stately-gentle, would she make<br>  My darkness blackness? and with how sweet grace<br>  She greeted my return! Bold will I be--<br>  Some goodly cognizance of Guinevere,<br>  In lieu of this rough beast upon my shield,<br>  Langued gules, and toothed with grinning savagery."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Arthur, when Sir Balin sought him, said<br>  "What wilt thou bear?" Balin was bold, and asked<br>  To bear her own crown-royal upon shield,<br>  Whereat she smiled and turned her to the King,<br>  Who answered "Thou shalt put the crown to use.<br>  The crown is but the shadow of the King,<br>  And this a shadow's shadow, let him have it,<br>  So this will help him of his violences!"<br>  "No shadow" said Sir Balin "O my Queen,<br>  But light to me! no shadow, O my King<br>  But golden earnest of a gentler life!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Balin bare the crown, and all the knights<br>  Approved him, and the Queen, and all the world<br>  Made music, and he felt his being move<br>  In music with his Order, and the King.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale, full-toned in middle May,<br>  Hath ever and anon a note so thin<br>  It seems another voice in other groves;<br>  Thus, after some quick burst of sudden wrath,<br>  The music in him seemed to change, and grow<br>  Faint and far-off.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once he saw the thrall<br>  His passion half had gauntleted to death,<br>  That causer of his banishment and shame,<br>  Smile at him, as he deemed, presumptuously:<br>  His arm half rose to strike again, but fell:<br>  The memory of that cognizance on shield<br>  Weighted it down, but in himself he moaned:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too high this mount of Camelot for me:<br>  These high-set courtesies are not for me.<br>  Shall I not rather prove the worse for these?<br>  Fierier and stormier from restraining, break<br>  Into some madness even before the Queen?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as a hearth lit in a mountain home,<br>  And glancing on the window, when the gloom<br>  Of twilight deepens round it, seems a flame<br>  That rages in the woodland far below,<br>  So when his moods were darkened, court and King<br>  And all the kindly warmth of Arthur's hall<br>  Shadowed an angry distance: yet he strove<br>  To learn the graces of their Table, fought<br>  Hard with himself, and seemed at length in peace.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then chanced, one morning, that Sir Balin sat<br>  Close-bowered in that garden nigh the hall.<br>  A walk of roses ran from door to door;<br>  A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:<br>  And down that range of roses the great Queen<br>  Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;<br>  And all in shadow from the counter door<br>  Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,<br>  As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced<br>  The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.<br>  Followed the Queen; Sir Balin heard her "Prince,<br>  Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,<br>  As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?"<br>  To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,<br>  "Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen?"<br>  "Yea so" she said "but so to pass me by--<br>  So loyal scarce is loyal to thyself,<br>  Whom all men rate the king of courtesy.<br>  Let be: ye stand, fair lord, as in a dream."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lancelot with his hand among the flowers<br>  "Yea--for a dream. Last night methought I saw<br>  That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand<br>  In yonder shrine. All round her prest the dark,<br>  And all the light upon her silver face<br>  Flowed from the spiritual lily that she held.<br>  Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes--away:<br>  For see, how perfect-pure! As light a flush<br>  As hardly tints the blossom of the quince<br>  Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweeter to me" she said "this garden rose<br>  Deep-hued and many-folded! sweeter still<br>  The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.<br>  Prince, we have ridden before among the flowers<br>  In those fair days--not all as cool as these,<br>  Though season-earlier. Art thou sad? or sick?<br>  Our noble King will send thee his own leech--<br>  Sick? or for any matter angered at me?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they dwelt<br>  Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall: her hue<br>  Changed at his gaze: so turning side by side<br>  They past, and Balin started from his bower.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Queen? subject? but I see not what I see.<br>  Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.<br>  My father hath begotten me in his wrath.<br>  I suffer from the things before me, know,<br>  Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;<br>  A churl, a clown!" and in him gloom on gloom<br>  Deepened: he sharply caught his lance and shield,<br>  Nor stayed to crave permission of the King,<br>  But, mad for strange adventure, dashed away.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the selfsame track as Balan, saw<br>  The fountain where they sat together, sighed<br>  "Was I not better there with him?" and rode<br>  The skyless woods, but under open blue<br>  Came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough<br>  Wearily hewing, "Churl, thine axe!" he cried,<br>  Descended, and disjointed it at a blow:<br>  To whom the woodman uttered wonderingly<br>  "Lord, thou couldst lay the Devil of these woods<br>  If arm of flesh could lay him." Balin cried<br>  "Him, or the viler devil who plays his part,<br>  To lay that devil would lay the Devil in me."<br>  "Nay" said the churl, "our devil is a truth,<br>  I saw the flash of him but yestereven.<br>  And some <i> do</i>  say that our Sir Garlon too<br>  Hath learned black magic, and to ride unseen.<br>  Look to the cave." But Balin answered him<br>  "Old fabler, these be fancies of the churl,<br>  Look to thy woodcraft," and so leaving him,<br>  Now with slack rein and careless of himself,<br>  Now with dug spur and raving at himself,<br>  Now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode;<br>  So marked not on his right a cavern-chasm<br>  Yawn over darkness, where, nor far within,<br>  The whole day died, but, dying, gleamed on rocks<br>  Roof-pendent, sharp; and others from the floor,<br>  Tusklike, arising, made that mouth of night<br>  Whereout the Demon issued up from Hell.<br>  He marked not this, but blind and deaf to all<br>  Save that chained rage, which ever yelpt within,<br>  Past eastward from the falling sun. At once<br>  He felt the hollow-beaten mosses thud<br>  And tremble, and then the shadow of a spear,<br>  Shot from behind him, ran along the ground.<br>  Sideways he started from the path, and saw,<br>  With pointed lance as if to pierce, a shape,<br>  A light of armour by him flash, and pass<br>  And vanish in the woods; and followed this,<br>  But all so blind in rage that unawares<br>  He burst his lance against a forest bough,<br>  Dishorsed himself, and rose again, and fled<br>  Far, till the castle of a King, the hall<br>  Of Pellam, lichen-bearded, grayly draped<br>  With streaming grass, appeared, low-built but strong;<br>  The ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss,<br>  The battlement overtopt with ivytods,<br>  A home of bats, in every tower an owl.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake the men of Pellam crying "Lord,<br>  Why wear ye this crown-royal upon shield?"<br>  Said Balin "For the fairest and the best<br>  Of ladies living gave me this to bear."<br>  So stalled his horse, and strode across the court,<br>  But found the greetings both of knight and King<br>  Faint in the low dark hall of banquet: leaves<br>  Laid their green faces flat against the panes,<br>  Sprays grated, and the cankered boughs without<br>  Whined in the wood; for all was hushed within,<br>  Till when at feast Sir Garlon likewise asked<br>  "Why wear ye that crown-royal?" Balin said<br>  "The Queen we worship, Lancelot, I, and all,<br>  As fairest, best and purest, granted me<br>  To bear it!" Such a sound (for Arthur's knights<br>  Were hated strangers in the hall) as makes<br>  The white swan-mother, sitting, when she hears<br>  A strange knee rustle through her secret reeds,<br>  Made Garlon, hissing; then he sourly smiled.<br>  "Fairest I grant her: I have seen; but best,<br>  Best, purest? <i> thou</i>  from Arthur's hall, and yet<br>  So simple! hast thou eyes, or if, are these<br>  So far besotted that they fail to see<br>  This fair wife-worship cloaks a secret shame?<br>  Truly, ye men of Arthur be but babes."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goblet on the board by Balin, bossed<br>  With holy Joseph's legend, on his right<br>  Stood, all of massiest bronze: one side had sea<br>  And ship and sail and angels blowing on it:<br>  And one was rough with wattling, and the walls<br>  Of that low church he built at Glastonbury.<br>  This Balin graspt, but while in act to hurl,<br>  Through memory of that token on the shield<br>  Relaxed his hold: "I will be gentle" he thought<br>  "And passing gentle" caught his hand away,<br>  Then fiercely to Sir Garlon "Eyes have I<br>  That saw today the shadow of a spear,<br>  Shot from behind me, run along the ground;<br>  Eyes too that long have watched how Lancelot draws<br>  From homage to the best and purest, might,<br>  Name, manhood, and a grace, but scantly thine,<br>  Who, sitting in thine own hall, canst endure<br>  To mouth so huge a foulness--to thy guest,<br>  Me, me of Arthur's Table. Felon talk!<br>  Let be! no more!"<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not the less by night<br>  The scorn of Garlon, poisoning all his rest,<br>  Stung him in dreams. At length, and dim through leaves<br>  Blinkt the white morn, sprays grated, and old boughs<br>  Whined in the wood. He rose, descended, met<br>  The scorner in the castle court, and fain,<br>  For hate and loathing, would have past him by;<br>  But when Sir Garlon uttered mocking-wise;<br>  "What, wear ye still that same crown-scandalous?"<br>  His countenance blackened, and his forehead veins<br>  Bloated, and branched; and tearing out of sheath<br>  The brand, Sir Balin with a fiery "Ha!<br>  So thou be shadow, here I make thee ghost,"<br>  Hard upon helm smote him, and the blade flew<br>  Splintering in six, and clinkt upon the stones.<br>  Then Garlon, reeling slowly backward, fell,<br>  And Balin by the banneret of his helm<br>  Dragged him, and struck, but from the castle a cry<br>  Sounded across the court, and--men-at-arms,<br>  A score with pointed lances, making at him--<br>  He dashed the pummel at the foremost face,<br>  Beneath a low door dipt, and made his feet<br>  Wings through a glimmering gallery, till he marked<br>  The portal of King Pellam's chapel wide<br>  And inward to the wall; he stept behind;<br>  Thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves<br>  Howling; but while he stared about the shrine,<br>  In which he scarce could spy the Christ for Saints,<br>  Beheld before a golden altar lie<br>  The longest lance his eyes had ever seen,<br>  Point-painted red; and seizing thereupon<br>  Pushed through an open casement down, leaned on it,<br>  Leapt in a semicircle, and lit on earth;<br>  Then hand at ear, and harkening from what side<br>  The blindfold rummage buried in the walls<br>  Might echo, ran the counter path, and found<br>  His charger, mounted on him and away.<br>  An arrow whizzed to the right, one to the left,<br>  One overhead; and Pellam's feeble cry<br>  "Stay, stay him! he defileth heavenly things<br>  With earthly uses"--made him quickly dive<br>  Beneath the boughs, and race through many a mile<br>  Of dense and open, till his goodly horse,<br>  Arising wearily at a fallen oak,<br>  Stumbled headlong, and cast him face to ground.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-wroth he had not ended, but all glad,<br>  Knightlike, to find his charger yet unlamed,<br>  Sir Balin drew the shield from off his neck,<br>  Stared at the priceless cognizance, and thought<br>  "I have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me,<br>  Thee will I bear no more," high on a branch<br>  Hung it, and turned aside into the woods,<br>  And there in gloom cast himself all along,<br>  Moaning "My violences, my violences!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the wholesome music of the wood<br>  Was dumbed by one from out the hall of Mark,<br>  A damsel-errant, warbling, as she rode<br>  The woodland alleys, Vivien, with her Squire.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire of Heaven has killed the barren cold,<br>  And kindled all the plain and all the wold.<br>  The new leaf ever pushes off the old.<br>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old priest, who mumble worship in your quire--<br>  Old monk and nun, ye scorn the world's desire,<br>  Yet in your frosty cells ye feel the fire!<br>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire of Heaven is on the dusty ways.<br>  The wayside blossoms open to the blaze.<br>  The whole wood-world is one full peal of praise.<br>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire of Heaven is lord of all things good,<br>  And starve not thou this fire within thy blood,<br>  But follow Vivien through the fiery flood!<br>  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then turning to her Squire "This fire of Heaven,<br>  This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,<br>  And beat the cross to earth, and break the King<br>  And all his Table."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they reached a glade,<br>  Where under one long lane of cloudless air<br>  Before another wood, the royal crown<br>  Sparkled, and swaying upon a restless elm<br>  Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire;<br>  Amazed were these; "Lo there" she cried--"a crown--<br>  Borne by some high lord-prince of Arthur's hall,<br>  And there a horse! the rider? where is he?<br>  See, yonder lies one dead within the wood.<br>  Not dead; he stirs!--but sleeping. I will speak.<br>  Hail, royal knight, we break on thy sweet rest,<br>  Not, doubtless, all unearned by noble deeds.<br>  But bounden art thou, if from Arthur's hall,<br>  To help the weak. Behold, I fly from shame,<br>  A lustful King, who sought to win my love<br>  Through evil ways: the knight, with whom I rode,<br>  Hath suffered misadventure, and my squire<br>  Hath in him small defence; but thou, Sir Prince,<br>  Wilt surely guide me to the warrior King,<br>  Arthur the blameless, pure as any maid,<br>  To get me shelter for my maidenhood.<br>  I charge thee by that crown upon thy shield,<br>  And by the great Queen's name, arise and hence."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Balin rose, "Thither no more! nor Prince<br>  Nor knight am I, but one that hath defamed<br>  The cognizance she gave me: here I dwell<br>  Savage among the savage woods, here die--<br>  Die: let the wolves' black maws ensepulchre<br>  Their brother beast, whose anger was his lord.<br>  O me, that such a name as Guinevere's,<br>  Which our high Lancelot hath so lifted up,<br>  And been thereby uplifted, should through me,<br>  My violence, and my villainy, come to shame."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereat she suddenly laughed and shrill, anon<br>  Sighed all as suddenly. Said Balin to her<br>  "Is this thy courtesy--to mock me, ha?<br>  Hence, for I will not with thee." Again she sighed<br>  "Pardon, sweet lord! we maidens often laugh<br>  When sick at heart, when rather we should weep.<br>  I knew thee wronged. I brake upon thy rest,<br>  And now full loth am I to break thy dream,<br>  But thou art man, and canst abide a truth,<br>  Though bitter. Hither, boy--and mark me well.<br>  Dost thou remember at Caerleon once--<br>  A year ago--nay, then I love thee not--<br>  Ay, thou rememberest well--one summer dawn--<br>  By the great tower--Caerleon upon Usk--<br>  Nay, truly we were hidden: this fair lord,<br>  The flower of all their vestal knighthood, knelt<br>  In amorous homage--knelt--what else?--O ay<br>  Knelt, and drew down from out his night-black hair<br>  And mumbled that white hand whose ringed caress<br>  Had wandered from her own King's golden head,<br>  And lost itself in darkness, till she cried--<br>  I thought the great tower would crash down on both--<br>  'Rise, my sweet King, and kiss me on the lips,<br>  Thou art my King.' This lad, whose lightest word<br>  Is mere white truth in simple nakedness,<br>  Saw them embrace: he reddens, cannot speak,<br>  So bashful, he! but all the maiden Saints,<br>  The deathless mother-maidenhood of Heaven<br>  Cry out upon her. Up then, ride with me!<br>  Talk not of shame! thou canst not, an thou would'st,<br>  Do these more shame than these have done themselves."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lied with ease; but horror-stricken he,<br>  Remembering that dark bower at Camelot,<br>  Breathed in a dismal whisper "It is truth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunnily she smiled "And even in this lone wood,<br>  Sweet lord, ye do right well to whisper this.<br>  Fools prate, and perish traitors. Woods have tongues,<br>  As walls have ears: but thou shalt go with me,<br>  And we will speak at first exceeding low.<br>  Meet is it the good King be not deceived.<br>  See now, I set thee high on vantage ground,<br>  From whence to watch the time, and eagle-like<br>  Stoop at thy will on Lancelot and the Queen."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ceased; his evil spirit upon him leapt,<br>  He ground his teeth together, sprang with a yell,<br>  Tore from the branch, and cast on earth, the shield,<br>  Drove his mailed heel athwart the royal crown,<br>  Stampt all into defacement, hurled it from him<br>  Among the forest weeds, and cursed the tale,<br>  The told-of, and the teller.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That weird yell,<br>  Unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast,<br>  Thrilled through the woods; and Balan lurking there<br>  (His quest was unaccomplished) heard and thought<br>  "The scream of that Wood-devil I came to quell!"<br>  Then nearing "Lo! he hath slain some brother-knight,<br>  And tramples on the goodly shield to show<br>  His loathing of our Order and the Queen.<br>  My quest, meseems, is here. Or devil or man<br>  Guard thou thine head." Sir Balin spake not word,<br>  But snatched a sudden buckler from the Squire,<br>  And vaulted on his horse, and so they crashed<br>  In onset, and King Pellam's holy spear,<br>  Reputed to be red with sinless blood,<br>  Reddened at once with sinful, for the point<br>  Across the maiden shield of Balan pricked<br>  The hauberk to the flesh; and Balin's horse<br>  Was wearied to the death, and, when they clashed,<br>  Rolling back upon Balin, crushed the man<br>  Inward, and either fell, and swooned away.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to her Squire muttered the damsel "Fools!<br>  This fellow hath wrought some foulness with his Queen:<br>  Else never had he borne her crown, nor raved<br>  And thus foamed over at a rival name:<br>  But thou, Sir Chick, that scarce hast broken shell,<br>  Art yet half-yolk, not even come to down--<br>  Who never sawest Caerleon upon Usk--<br>  And yet hast often pleaded for my love--<br>  See what I see, be thou where I have been,<br>  Or else Sir Chick--dismount and loose their casques<br>  I fain would know what manner of men they be."<br>  And when the Squire had loosed them, "Goodly!--look!<br>  They might have cropt the myriad flower of May,<br>  And butt each other here, like brainless bulls,<br>  Dead for one heifer!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the gentle Squire<br>  "I hold them happy, so they died for love:<br>  And, Vivien, though ye beat me like your dog,<br>  I too could die, as now I live, for thee."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live on, Sir Boy," she cried, "I better prize<br>  The living dog than the dead lion: away!<br>  I cannot brook to gaze upon the dead."<br>  Then leapt her palfrey o'er the fallen oak,<br>  And bounding forward "Leave them to the wolves."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when their foreheads felt the cooling air,<br>  Balin first woke, and seeing that true face,<br>  Familiar up from cradle-time, so wan,<br>  Crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay,<br>  And on his dying brother cast himself<br>  Dying; and <i> he</i>  lifted faint eyes; he felt<br>  One near him; all at once they found the world,<br>  Staring wild-wide; then with a childlike wail,<br>  And drawing down the dim disastrous brow<br>  That o'er him hung, he kissed it, moaned and spake;<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Balin, Balin, I that fain had died<br>  To save thy life, have brought thee to thy death.<br>  Why had ye not the shield I knew? and why<br>  Trampled ye thus on that which bare the Crown?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Balin told him brokenly, and in gasps,<br>  All that had chanced, and Balan moaned again.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, I dwelt a day in Pellam's hall:<br>  This Garlon mocked me, but I heeded not.<br>  And one said 'Eat in peace! a liar is he,<br>  And hates thee for the tribute!' this good knight<br>  Told me, that twice a wanton damsel came,<br>  And sought for Garlon at the castle-gates,<br>  Whom Pellam drove away with holy heat.<br>  I well believe this damsel, and the one<br>  Who stood beside thee even now, the same.<br>  'She dwells among the woods' he said 'and meets<br>  And dallies with him in the Mouth of Hell.'<br>  Foul are their lives; foul are their lips; they lied.<br>  Pure as our own true Mother is our Queen."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O brother" answered Balin "Woe is me!<br>  My madness all thy life has been thy doom,<br>  Thy curse, and darkened all thy day; and now<br>  The night has come. I scarce can see thee now.<br>  Goodnight! for we shall never bid again <br>  Goodmorrow--Dark my doom was here, and dark<br>  It will be there. I see thee now no more.<br>  I would not mine again should darken thine,<br>  Goodnight, true brother."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balan answered low<br>  "Goodnight, true brother here! goodmorrow there!<br>  We two were born together, and we die<br>  Together by one doom:" and while he spoke<br>  Closed his death-drowsing eyes, and slept the sleep<br>  With Balin, either locked in either's arm.<br>
