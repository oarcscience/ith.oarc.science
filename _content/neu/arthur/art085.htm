<p align="LEFT"> ACT  I.</p> 
<p align="LEFT"> SCENE. -- <i> A wooded spot in the meadows near Camelot.  King Arthur and his Court, who are on their way to meet Guinevere, are arriving.  The scene is full of movement and gaiety. From the distance, gradually growing  louder and nearer, are heard sounds of cheering. It is late afternoon, and the  scene is filled with the golden glow of the setting sun.</i> <br> <br> AGRAVAINE  <i> and </i> VIVIEN <i> converse apart.</i>  MORDRED<i> , at a little distance, stands  buried in moody thought. </i> AGRAVAINE <i> approaches</i>  MORDRED. VIVIEN <i> joins  them.</i> <br> <br> AGRA. My lord, thy moody visage would proclaim<br> Our cause as  lost, while yet our spears are bright,<br> Our bodies whole, our helms without  a dent.<br> <br> [<i> The </i> CROWD <i> cheer in distance.</i> <br> <br> MORD. Like one  struck blind I am grown wise in sound,<br> And pick my way by virtue of mine ears.<br> <br> AGRA.  The sightless needs must go with troubled gait,<br> But, having eyes, <i> we</i>   hold our course unstayed,<br> And beat the craven earth till it resounds<br> Our  praises unto Him that gave us sight.<br> <br> MORD. He that may hear the thunder  of the surf,<br> And feinting that he hears it not, finds death<br> In the chill,  clinging fingers of the deep --<br> Deserves no better fate.<br> <br> AGRA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet  shall the deaf<br> Not meet his master in the brutish sea,<br> For by the magic  of an eye, he holds<br> In leash the dripping jaws that spit at him,<br> White,  stinging drops of frenzied impotence;<br> While from afar the poor blind hears  the roar,<br> Which clogs his feet with chains of formless fear,<br> And smites  his soul with devastating dread.<br> <br> [<i> Cheers are heard again nearer.</i> <br> <br> MORD.  But when the darkness falls all men are blind:<br> 'Tis then the wise have counsel  of their ears.<br> Ye hear these sounds; wouldst urge me to believe<br> They threaten  naught of ill?<br> <br> AGRA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught;  save to those<br> That pale at forest echoings, and take<br> A mental ague from  a creaking branch.<br> <br> VIV. Mordred, these shoutings mean us good or ill<br> As  we interpret them.<br> <br> MORD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  me they mean<br> New foes made fast and unsured friends grown cold.<br> Wherever  Arthur moves it is the same;<br> He has the trick of catching man's good will,<br> And  bracing waverers. Let him but roam<br> This vasty, echoing England as he list,<br> And  from Carlisle to sea-scarred Tintagil<br> The whole land would be ringing with  his name.<br> <br> AGRA. Cast off thy gloom, my lord; the public tongue<br> Is but  a wanton, and is little famed<br> For constancy!<br> <br> VIV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis  true enough, my lord;<br> These throats that now shout "Arthur" would  as lief<br> Suck wind enough to make the welkin ring<br> With cries of "Mordred"  -- if they had a cause.<br> <br> AGRA. And where shall better cause be found than  in<br> The uncleared doubts of Arthur's ancestry?<br> He calls <i> thee</i>  nephew,  and in that bare word<br> Lies his sole claim and title to the crown.<br> What other  proof can he produce save thee?<br> And if thou say'st he is no kin of thine,<br> Then  art thou King in thine own lawful right.<br> <br> VIV. While Merlin lived, his word  did stand as good<br> As child-bed witnesses, but he is dead.<br> Who now shall  challenge the compelling cry,<br> "This is no son of Uther -- not the King!"<br> <br> MORD.  That cry, my friends, was lisped by last year's leaves,<br> Which have no voice  in this spring's forestry.<br> The rabble ask not how the King is bred,<br> Nor  know, nor care. They love this man as man,<br> And, loving him, I do foresee a  Queen,<br> A new bond 'twixt the people and the King;<br> A double cord where only  one has been.<br> <br> AGRA. Mark well my words: thy fears are placed amiss.<br> The  King has thriven! Truly so -- but how?<br> By being ever at the people's beck,<br> Forswearing  self and soft indulgencies<br> In ceaseless striving for the nation's weal.<br> He  is their friend, their champion, their slave.<br> Let it be so! But will ye see  the end<br> Of this so dear devotion? Then behold --<br> A Queen more beautiful  than earth at dawn,<br> Fairer than moonlight as it steals its way<br> Through lattice  op'nings to a bridal couch.<br> Trust me our model King shall not resist<br> A lure  so sweet, but lend himself entire<br> To love's abandonments, until he finds<br> Duty,  resolve, and Kingship fade away,<br> And leave him, stript of purpose and repute,<br> A  prey to common outcry, and to us.<br> <br> MORD. Yet was my plan more swift. With  Launcelot<br> And numbers of our most feared knights away<br> In far Cameliard,  or capering<br> Attendance on the homing Guinevere<br> In the long stages of their  slow return;<br> With ferment in the West, and at the Court<br> No thought of pending  harm -- We should have struck,<br> Suddenly and swift, on Westminster, before<br> The  Queen's strong escort had rejoined the King.<br> <br> AGRA. The time had been misjudged,  and thy whole plan<br> Foredoomed to failure. Were we now to strike,<br> This crowd  would forge an armour for the King<br> Of bodies interwoven, against which<br> All  mortal blades were vincible. But wait<br> Until they see their idol dallying<br> In  soft, assotted fondness on the Queen;<br> See him grown smooth with pleasuring  and round<br> With table practices; show them a King<br> Unfaithful to the promise  of his youth --<br> Then may we strike and have these mouthing churls<br> Not fronting  us, but charging at our backs.<br> <br> VIV. [<i> With eager curiosity.</i> ] When  didst thou see the lady Guinevere?<br> <br> AGRA. 'Twas in her native land, Cameliard,<br> When  I was hunting there an autumn since.<br> I saw the damsel oft, but wot I best<br> Of  my first sight of her. 'Twas on a morn<br> All grey as agelong night. Upon the  castle hill<br> Fierce shadows flung themselves, like shapeless beasts<br> Upon  a dying foe, and earth lay stunned<br> 'Neath their benumbing touch. When suddenly<br> The  grey walls cleft and issued forth a maid --<br> A fair white maid with streaming  hair of gold,<br> That brake upon her shoulders and flowed down,<br> A gleaming  amber torrent, to her feet.<br> She seemed like sunlight glinting from a rock,<br> And  where she walked the sombre earth was sewn<br> With a lithe-moving skein of gold.<br> <br> MORD.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perdy!<br> But  these same lily-maids in Nature's way<br> Develop dangerously. Shall we then<br> Stand  idly by while Nature hatches us<br> New claimants for our crown?<br> <br> VIV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay,  have no fear<br> Of Nature, till thou need her tenderings.<br> I trust her least  when she's at midwif'ry.<br> Quick to undo what is so hardly done,<br> Unmaking  always swifter than she makes,<br> So loth to spare, so keen to seize again,<br> She  covets life from life's first death-bought breath.<br> If I must take Dame Nature  for my friend,<br> Give me suspense of her good services<br> Till I be harvesting.<br> <br> AGRA.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere  Nature deals<br> Our cause a hurt in form of Arthur's heir,<br> We have large time  to shape our plans.<br> <br> VIV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  time<br> To act on them. Either appeal to might<br> And press the issue at the lance's  point,<br> Or hold us still, what time our Royal prey,<br> Steeped in deep draughts  of stupefying ease,<br> Sinks to that sleep which never is renewed.<br> <br> AGRA.  'Tis as shall be, and being so, 'tis well.<br> <br> MORD. [<i> Roused from a reverie,  and angrily.</i> ] 'Tis well, ye say! How well? I swear 'tis ill<br> Ye judge this  priestly lord as some raw youth,<br> Fierce and incontinent from long restraint.<br> Ye  know not Arthur well who judge him so.<br> The source of his famed purity is ice.<br> In  time he may be thawed. What! Are we Gods<br> To sew the hours and reap the centuries?<br> A  year at least 'twill take his pious eyes<br> To learn her charms. A further year  ere yet<br> He soils his virgin conscience with desire.<br> God wot how long we  bite our nails the while<br> He sways between desire and the desired.<br> Life is  too short to wait for this green fruit<br> To ripe and fall, full rotten, in our  palm.<br> God send him West to-night to quell the strife,<br> And I'll delay no  longer than the dawn<br> To compass our bold ends by bolder means.<br> I'll waste  no patience paltering with knots<br> That may be carved asunder at a blow;<br> Nor  doze beside a snare while I have strength<br> To bring my quarry down in open fight.<br> <br> [<i> Enter  </i> ARTHUR<i> , with</i>  KNIGHTS<i>  and </i> MESSENGER.<br> <br> AGRA. Here Arthur  comes. Methinks I'd liever wait<br> To pull his tusks, till that old boar was dead.<br> <br> ARTH.  [<i> To a</i>  MESSENGER.] My lords, we'll bide no more in this green spot<br> The  coming of the Queen. If from Sir Bors<br> Or Launcelot come other messengers,<br> Let  them attend at once.<br> <br> [<i> Exit </i> MESSENGER.<br> <br> MORD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast  news, my lord,<br> That bars our onward march?<br> <br> ARTH. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  much of news<br> That love's advance has ended in retreat.<br> Our toes are even  turned upon our heels;<br> Our laggard tail has ta'en itself a head,<br> That points  our duty far from our desires!<br> <br> VIV. Sir King, 'tis easy seen some fresh  unrest<br> Is tangled in the web of thy concerns.<br> <br> ARTH. Our message still  lacks answer from the Welsh.<br> With no alarm, but some uneasiness,<br> We question  the intent of this delay.<br> Sir Bors is waiting at his charger's head,<br> One  eye on us and one fixed on the West,<br> And cannot tell which whither he will  ride.<br> While we, impatient to be on, must keep<br> In distance of his call. If  we discharge<br> The short few miles that hold us from the Queen,<br> We put that  distance 'tween us and the men<br> That may have need of me.<br> <br> AGRA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis  no light thing,<br> This task of royalty. It confiscates<br> All small prerogatives  in man, and while<br> It lifts him to the mountain-top, it holds<br> Him fast, as  in the cleavage of a rock.<br> The King scarce dares to call himself, or this<br> Or  that -- husband or friend or lover -- but,<br> Removed from all such fond, enfeebling  ties<br> Of heart and interest, must ever be,<br> And ever know himself to be --  the King!<br> <br> ARTH. Yet would I not, for all it gave in ease<br> Or licence  of life's liberties, renounce<br> One jot of the responsibility<br> That's vested  in the crown. 'Tis privileged<br> For Kings to live and joy and suffer -- ay,<br> And  when death comes, to meet it like a King.<br> Come, nephew; come, my Lady Vivien,<br> Who  wilt be friend and kin to Guinevere;<br> I'd have thee know my purpose for the  Queen,<br> Lest day should find us speeding to the West.<br> <br> [<i> Exit </i> ARTHUR  <i> and</i>  MORDRED. VIVIEN <i> stands in deep thought.</i> <br> <br> AGRA. [<i> Significantly  to</i>  VIVIEN.] A day will come we shall recall with smiles<br> These windy words  of Sir Morality,<br> And judge poor Adam's fall with less contempt.<br> <br> VIV.  [<i> In a tone of earnest enquiry.</i> ] Is she so beautiful, so wondrous fair,<br> That  e'en the stainless Arthur shall forget<br> His conscience as he looks on her?<br> <br> AGRA.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  fair,<br> As he is man he cannot choose but look,<br> And as he looks, forget. And  so forgetting, die.<br> Let us go chase our tails to Camelot!<br> <br> [<i> Exit</i>   AGRAVAINE.<br> <i> <br> </i> VIV. [<i> Meditatively.</i> ]<br> And as he looks forget!  [<i> With sudden animation.</i> ]<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  he? But Launcelot?<br> Shall she subdue the proud, responseless heart,<br> That  has disdained a beauty not less rare?<br> Ah God! shall Launcelot withstand a snare<br> That  threats the resolution of the King?<br> Yet I'll believe it not, till I have seen<br> With  my own eyes. Till then I'll not believe.<br> <br> [<i> Exit</i>  VIVIEN <i> hurriedly.</i> <br> </p> 
<p align="LEFT"> SCENE  II. -- The same.<br> <i> The stage remains empty for some moments, and the sound  of distant cheers shows that the retinue of </i> KING ARTHUR<i>  is already well  on the return journey. Presently, from the opposite direction, is heard the sound  of</i>  MUSIC<i> , and the cavalcade that is escorting</i>  GUINEVERE <i> to </i> CAMELOT  <i> make a leisurely appearance. The cavalcade crosses the stage on horseback and  on foot. Their voices die away in the distance.</i> <br> <br> CHORUS.<br> Pink and  white, O flower of Spring,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread a carpet  fair and sweet,<br> Deck her progress to the King,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop  to kiss her lily feet.<br> She is come, the bride of May,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed  her to the morrow;<br> Sweet the May and sweet the day,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  sweet, more sweet, the morrow.<br> Pink and white above her head,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curtain  her till morning light,<br> Burst thy heart to strew her bed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Neath  the canopy of night.<br> She is here, the bride of May,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guard  her to the morrow.<br> Sweet the May and sweet the day,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O  haste the sweeter morrow.</p> 
<p align="LEFT"> [<i> During the singing of the latter  part, off,</i>  GUINEVERE <i> and </i> LAUNCELOT <i> enter.</i> </p> 
<p align="LEFT"> GUIN.  Tell me again, Sir Knight, of this great King<br> Whose bride I am to be. Unless,  perchance,<br> I weary thee with ceaseless questionings.<br> <br> LAUNC. My Queen,  I doubt if aught remains untold;<br> But since what was to tell, was good to hear,<br> List  once again of him that serves no lord<br> But conscience, and of all his Knights  requires<br> But this -- that they revere their conscience as the King.<br> <br> GUIN.  Tell me, my lord, are all of Arthur's Court<br> Like unto thee in likeness to the  King?<br> <br> LAUNC. He has no like or similar, but is to men<br> Even as thou among  the Queens of Earth.<br> <br> GUIN. Ah no! I am of those that he transcends.<br> I  tremble, but in lifting up mine eyes<br> To his high state. How shall he mate with  one<br> Who draws her being from the lowly earth?<br> The sun is in my blood, and  my poor heart<br> Is caught by every breath of life and swayed,<br> As leaves are  lift and rustled by the breeze,<br> That wills nor works them harm. I have been  taught<br> To love all that is worshipful and true,<br> Because 'tis good and not  for conscience sake.<br> And must I now lay siege unto myself,<br> Usurp the guards  that Nature gave, and arm<br> My heart with duty, and the law of Kings?<br> <br> LAUNC.  As truth's unconscious beauty is to thee,<br> Is conscience to the King -- no striving,<br> But  the unstudied working of a mind<br> That dwells on none in search of littleness,<br> But  holds all flesh in fair equality.<br> No maiden's heart could be more sure bestowed,<br> Nor  maiden's faith find safer harbourage,<br> Than in the keeping of our England's  King.<br> <br> GUIN. Sir Knight, I like thy hymning of his praise,<br> And his great  virtues may not plead in vain<br> The truage due to his nobility.<br> But for his  Kingship, hast thou yet to learn,<br> For ev'ry maid there is but one true King?<br> He  is not crowned with shout or gilded pomp,<br> Nor flashes to the sky from quick  drawn steel,<br> The cartel of his liege's loyalty.<br> But on his throne, secure,  inviolate,<br> The siege set up within a maiden's heart,<br> He reigns sole lord,  and wields a sway supreme,<br> Unconscious of his own dear sovereignty.<br> <br> LAUNC.  If this be so, then must I hold myself<br> Most honoured among Knights, in that  I bring<br> A Queen to grace our England: for the King,<br> A Kingdom fairer than  men's eyes have seen.<br> <br> GUIN. Hast thou, my lord, thy rightful Kingdom won,<br> Or  is it still unsought for, undesired?<br> <br> LAUNC. Kingdoms have come and gone  and are forgot,<br> And thrones will fall before the thrones to be,<br> But beauty,  labouring in joy, brought forth<br> One queen to stand as pattern for all time,<br> And  at that birth fulfilled herself. So must<br> She barren be of Queens for evermore.<br> <br> GUIN.  [<i> Sadly.</i> ] Long live thy Queen, Sir Knight, and long thy reign<br> In the  rich kingdom of thy lady's heart.<br> <br> LAUNC. Ah, deem me not so blest! The  throne I sought<br> Is changed from throne to shrine at my approach,<br> And low  before the saint that stands within,<br> Where I may never kneel, another kneels.<br> <br> GUIN.  I too can see, it must be with thine eyes,<br> That miscalled saint, that looks  not down but forth,<br> From him that kneels to one that stands beyond.<br> <br> LAUNC.  I pray that God who fashioned love's sweet throne<br> In her pure heart, may furnish  her the guard<br> To hold it 'gainst the base, usurping Knight,<br> Who, helplessly  impelled to the attack,<br> Would rend the bonds that bind him to his friend,<br> Scatter  like straws, love, loyalty and truth<br> And thrust himself, a traitor, on the  throne.<br> <br> GUIN. No traitor! He that conquers is the King.<br> No traitor,  but the lord of his own realm.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> As one reading his own impeachment.</i> ]<br> Traitor  to him, who, holding one his friend,<br> Did speed him forth to bring again his  bride.<br> To him who clasped his hand long since, and vowed,<br> "Let chance  what will, I trust thee to the death."<br> So dear he prized that trust, he  had defied<br> Or love or hate to prove him what he is --<br> Traitor to self and  faithless to his liege,<br> <br> [<i> Turning to </i> GUINEVERE<i>  directly.</i> ]<br> <br> False  to the uttermost -- even to thee!<br> <br> GUIN. O Launcelot, forbear!

Enter</i>  LAUNCELOT'S PAGE, <i> travel-stained  and distressed.</i> <br> <br> [<i> To</i>  PAGE <i> with eager intensity.</i> ]<br> <br> Speak,  Sir, what tidings do ye bring?<br> <br> PAGE. [<i> Tongue-tied, with emotion.</i> ]  Madam --<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Feverishly.</i> ] Stay not to pick thy words. There is  no tongue<br> Can pluck the bitterness from woe, or weave<br> A vestment to make  fair, grief's nakedness.<br> What is thy news?<br> <br> PAGE. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam,  the day is ours.<br> Sir Morded is among the dead.<br> <br> GUIN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes!  Yes!<br> Thou seest how we hang upon thy words!<br> Tell on!<br> <br> PAGE. Would  God there were no more to tell!<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> Frantic with impatience.</i> ]  Sir, must we wait till thou art grown a man,<br> To learn thy news? Or would'st  thou have us tear<br> The tidings from thy craven tongue?<br> <br> PAGE. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady,<br> Our  sovereign lord, King Arthur, is no more!<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> is stunned by the  news, and stands for a moment overcome. The </i> ABBESS <i> goes to her.</i> <br> <br> ABBESS.  He has said, I am thy refuge and thy strength.<br> The Lord that gives, the Lord  that takes away,<br> Have thee in His grace.<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> scarcely heeds  the </i> ABBESS, <i> but turns again to</i>  PAGE.<br> <br> GUIN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  he, thy master,<br> How fares Sir Lancelot? Is he of those<br> That live?<br> <br> PAGE.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He follows  with what speed he may.<br> <br> GUIN. He lives! He lives!<br> <br> PAGE. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives,  Madam, but is like to die.<br> <br> GUIN. To die? Ah no! He lives! Thou saidst he  lives.<br> <br> PAGE. He took a hurt intended for the King,<br> Upon whose shoulder  as a shield he hung<br> Throughout the fight.<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> trembles and  sways. The </i> ABBESS <i> puts her arms about her. The chant is resumed. Presently  there are more sounds without, and </i> LAUNCELOT <i> enters, supported between  </i> TWO KNIGHTS. <i> He is in full armour save for his helm. He is dazed with loss  of blood, and his sight is failing.</i> <br> <br> LAUNC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently,  fair Sirs; the road<br> Is all composed of unremembered turns,<br> And this new  darkness maketh all things strange.<br> <br> GUIN. [<i> With a great sob.</i> ] Ah  God! he comes to die!<br> <br> LAUNC. I heard a voice<br> Of one afar; a voice made  sweet with tears.<br> Am I not near the Queen?<br> <br> [GUINEVERE <i> crosses over  to</i>  LAUNCELOT.<br> <br> GUIN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye,  Launcelot,<br> I am that Guinevere that was the Queen.<br> <br> LAUNC. The fight  is done, my Queen. The realm is safe,<br> But he, the King --<br> <br> GUIN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  have been told. And thou --<br> Where is thy wound?<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> In a far-away  voice.</i> ] He spake no word, but died<br> All silently, as men might die in dreams.<br> <br> GUIN.  [<i> To the supporting</i>  KNIGHTS.] Sirs, bear him tenderly, and set him free<br> From  the misprized enchantment of his mail.<br> [<i> To </i> LAUNCELOT.] Art thou sore  hurt? Yet is there ease in store;<br> Thou wilt bide here till I shall make thee  whole.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> Recovering himself.</i> ] My Queen, I may not stay at  thy command.<br> I must go hence, at once, to join the King.<br> 'Tis said by ghostly  men that all will be<br> Fair equals in the beautiful beyond.<br> 'Tis false! I  have no equal there or here;<br> For I have prest my mouth upon thy mouth,<br> And  touched thy golden head, and felt thy heart<br> Beat strong beneath the worship  of my hand.<br> <br> [<i> The QUEEN weeps.</i> ]<br> <br> Weep not, my Queen, but give  me leave to go.<br> <br> [LAUNCELOT <i> steps forward from between the </i> KNIGHTS  <i> that support him and falls with a heavy crash of armour to the ground. </i> GUINEVERE  <i> makes a movement to go to him, but the</i>  ABBESS <i> restrains her.</i> <br> <br> LAUNC.

This love is mine;  I have nought else to give<br> But this, my deathless love, this frailty<br> That  moves me e'en against the will of God,<br> And fills my heart with eager sacrifice.<br> <br> [GUINEVERE  <i> goes to</i>  LAUNCELOT, <i> who is supported against the knee of one of his</i>   KNIGHTS, <i> and bends over him.</i> <br> <br> LAUNC. O Guinevere, 'tis not to die  I grieve,<br> But to die thus, and leave to thee the shame.<br> <br> GUIN. Beloved,  if this love were only mine,<br> I had been dead of shame ere now; but if<br> Some  smallest part of it belong to thee,<br> O deck me bride-wise in the web of it,<br> Or  hang it for a charm upon my breast.<br> <br> LAUNC. [<i> In a low voice of one dying.</i> ]  The sin so sweet that we may not repent,<br> The love that suffers all things.  O my Queen,<br> Thou makest death more sweet to me than life.<br> <br> GUIN.

In life,<br> In  death, we are together still,<br> My heart upon thy true heart beats its last.<br> <br> [<i> The  full-risen sun sheds a golden glory on the lovers. </i> GUINEVERE<i>  strains him  to her breast and kisses his mouth.

<p align="LEFT"> GUIN.  Not yet, O God! The time is not quite yet!<br> <br> [<i> Still pressing him to her,  she raises the lifeless arm and replaces it about her neck.
