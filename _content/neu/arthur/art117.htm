Pray you, does the Lord<br> Will that all folks should be quite happy and good?<br> I love God now a little, if this cord<br> <br> "Were broken, once for all what striving could<br> Make me love anything in earth or heaven?<br> So day by day it grew, as if one should<br> <br> "Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,<br> Down to a cool sea on a summer day;<br> Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven<br> <br> "Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,<br> Until one surely reached the sea at last,<br> And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay<br> <br> "Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past<br> Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,<br> Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast,<br> <br> "In the lone sea, far off from any ships!<br> Do I not know now of a day in Spring?<br> No minute of the wild day ever slips<br> <br> "From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,<br> And wheresoever I may be, straightway<br> Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:<br> <br> "I was half mad with beauty on that day,<br> And went without my ladies all alone,<br> In a quiet garden walled round every way;<br> <br> "I was right joyful of that wall of stone,<br> That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,<br> And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,<br> <br> "Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy<br> With weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;<br> Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,<br> <br> "A little thing just then had made me mad;<br> I dared not think, as I was wont to do,<br> Sometimes, upon my beauty; if I had<br> <br> "Held out my long hand up against the blue,<br> And, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers,<br> Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,<br> <br> "There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers,<br> Round by the edges; what should I have done,<br> If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,<br> <br> "And startling green drawn upward by the sun?<br> But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,<br> And trancedly stood watching the west wind run<br> <br> "With faintest half-heard breathing sound: why there<br> I lose my head e'en now in doing this;<br> But shortly listen: In that garden fair<br> <br> "Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss<br> Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,<br> I scarce dare talk of the remember'd bliss,<br> <br> "When both our mouths went wandering in one way,<br> And aching sorely, met among the leaves;<br> Our hands being left behind strained far away.<br> <br> "Never within a yard of my bright sleeves<br> Had Launcelot come before: and now so nigh!<br> After that day why is it Guenevere grieves?<br> <br> "Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,<br> Whatever happened on through all those years,<br> God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie.<br> <br> "Being such a lady could I weep these tears<br> If this were true?  A great queen such as I<br> Having sinn'd this way, straight her conscience sears;<br> <br> "And afterwards she liveth hatefully,<br> Slaying and poisoning, certes never weeps:<br> Gauwaine be friends now, speak me lovingly.<br> <br> "Do I not see how God's dear pity creeps<br> All through your frame, and trembles in your mouth?<br> Remember in what grave your mother sleeps,<br> <br> "Buried in some place far down in the south,<br> Men are forgetting as I speak to you;<br> By her head sever'd in that awful drouth<br> <br> "Of pity that drew Agravaine's fell blow,<br> I pray you pity! let me not scream out<br> For ever after, when the shrill winds blow<br> <br> "Through half your castle-locks! let me not shout<br> For ever after in the winter night<br> When you ride out alone! in battle-rout<br> <br> "Let not my rusting tears make your sword light!<br> Ah! God of mercy, how he turns away!<br> So, ever must I dress me to the fight,<br> <a> <br> "So: let God's justice work!  Gauwaine, I say,<br> See me hew down your proofs: yea all men know<br> Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,<br> <br> "One bitter day in la Fausse Garde, for so<br> All good knights held it after, saw:<br> Yea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though<br> <br> "You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw,<br> This Mellyagraunce saw blood upon my bed:<br> Whose blood then pray you? is there any law<br> <br> "To make a queen say why some spots of red<br> Lie on her coverlet? or will you say:<br> 'Your hands are white, lady, as when you wed,<br> <br> "'Where did you bleed?' and must I stammer out, 'Nay,<br> I blush indeed, fair lord, only to rend<br> My sleeve up to my shoulder, where there lay<br> <br> "'A knife-point last night': so must I defend<br> The honour of the Lady Guenevere?<br> Not so, fair lords, even if the world should end<br> <br> "This very day, and you were judges here<br> Instead of God.  Did you see Mellyagraunce<br> When Launcelot stood by him? what white fear<br> <br> "Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance,<br> His side sink in? as my knight cried and said:<br> 'Slayer of unarm'd men, here is a chance!<br> <br> "'Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head,<br> By God I am so glad to fight with you,<br> Stripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead<br> <br> "'For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do,<br> For all my wounds are moving in my breast,<br> And I am getting mad with waiting so.'<br> <br> "He struck his hands together o'er the beast,<br> Who fell down flat, and grovell'd at his feet,<br> And groan'd at being slain so young: 'At least,'<br> <br> "My knight said, 'rise you, sir, who are so fleet<br> At catching ladies, half-arm'd will I fight,<br> My left side all uncovered!' then I weet,<br> <br> "Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight<br> Upon his knave's face; not until just then<br> Did I quite hate him, as I saw my knight<br> <br> "Along the lists look to my stake and pen<br> With such a joyous smile, it made me sigh<br> From agony beneath my waist-chain, when<br> <br> "The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;<br> Ever Sir Launcelot kept him on the right,<br> And traversed warily, and ever high<br> <br> "And fast leapt caitiff's sword, until my knight<br> Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand,<br> Caught it, and swung it; that was all the fight,<br> <br> "Except a spout of blood on the hot land;<br> For it was hottest summer; and I know<br> I wonder'd how the fire, while I should stand,<br> <br> "And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,<br> Yards above my head; thus these matters went;<br> Which things were only warnings of the woe<br> <br> "That fell on me.  Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,<br> For Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord;<br> Therefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent<br> <br> "With all this wickedness; say no rash word<br> Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes,<br> Wept all away to grey, may bring some sword<br> <br> "To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise,<br> Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand;<br> And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,<br> <br> "Yea also at my full heart's strong command,<br> See through my long throat how the words go up<br> In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand<br> <br> "The shadow lies like wine within a cup<br> Of marvellously colour'd gold; yea now<br> This little wind is rising, look you up,<br> <br> "And wonder how the light is falling so<br> Within my moving tresses: will you dare,<br> When you have looked a little on my brow,<br> <br> "To say this thing is vile? or will you care<br> For any plausible lies of cunning woof,<br> When you can see my face with no lie there<br> <br> "For ever? am I not a gracious proof:<br> 'But in your chamber Launcelot was found':<br> Is there a good knight then would stand aloof,<br> <br> "When a queen says with gentle queenly sound:<br> 'O true as steel come now and talk with me,<br> I love to see your step upon the ground<br> <br> "'Unwavering, also well I love to see<br> That gracious smile light up your face, and hear<br> Your wonderful words, that all mean verily<br> <br> "'The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear<br> To me in everything, come here to-night,<br> Or else the hours will pass most dull and drear;<br> <br> "'If you come not, I fear this time I might<br> Get thinking over much of times gone by,<br> When I was young, and green hope was in sight:<br> <br> "'For no man cares now to know why I sigh;<br> And no man comes to sing me pleasant songs,<br> Nor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie<br> <br> "'So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs<br> To see you, Launcelot; that we may be<br> Like children once again, free from all wrongs<br> <br> "'Just for one night.'  Did he not come to me?<br> What thing could keep true Launcelot away<br> If I said, 'Come'? there was one less than three<br> <br> "In my quiet room that night, and we were gay;<br> Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick,<br> Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea<br> <br> "I looked at Launcelot's face and could not speak,<br> For he looked helpless too, for a little while;<br> Then I remember how I tried to shriek,<br> <br> "And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile<br> The stones they threw up rattled o'er my head<br> And made me dizzier; till within a while<br> <br> "My maids were all about me, and my head<br> On Launcelot's breast was being soothed away<br> From its white chattering, until Launcelot said:<br> <br> "By God! I will not tell you more to-day,<br> Judge any way you will: what matters it?<br> You know quite well the story of that fray,<br> <br> "How Launcelot still'd their bawling, the mad fit<br> That caught up Gauwaine: all, all, verily,<br> But just that which would save me; these things flit.<br> <br> "Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,<br> Whatever may have happen'd these long years,<br> God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie!<br> <br> "All I have said is truth, by Christ's dear tears."<br> She would not speak another word, but stood<br> Turn'd sideways; listening, like a man who hears<br> <br> His brother's trumpet sounding through the wood<br> Of his foes' lances.  She lean'd eagerly,<br> And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could<br> <br> At last hear something really; joyfully<br> Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed<br> Of the roan charger drew all men to see,<br> The knight who came was Launcelot at good need.<br>
