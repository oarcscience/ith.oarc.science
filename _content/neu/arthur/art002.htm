Far off the ripple broke<br>  Upon the beach unheard, but flasht in air<br>  Its silver, and in palace court the birds<br>  Of morning sang.  Then to herself the Queen:<br>  <br>  "Lo, absent Tristram is not all in all<br>  To me, Mark's wife.  There yet abides in life<br>  Something of worth, tho' Tristram be not here."<br>  <br>  The saying pleas'd her, and she turn'd it o'er.<br>  "Something of worth, tho' Tristram be not here."<br>  Then rising from the couch which Mark had left<br>  Ere rose the sun from out the Cornish sea,<br>  She call'd her waiting maidens to their task,<br>  And paus'd before two gowns the damsels brought,<br>  As doubtful how she should array herself.<br>  One of green samite, o'er which wander'd strings<br>  Of gleaming pearls, in mazy pattern set,<br>  So that the eye wearied to follow, held<br>  Her but such space while one with even breath<br>  Might count a dozen; then her glance upon<br>  The other fell, a silken robe of blue<br>  Shot thro' and thro' with shimmering silver lights.<br>  And this her choice at length for that day's wear,<br>  Not unforgetful how Sir Tristram lov'd<br>  To see her in it; and, when her waiting maids<br>  Had rob'd her, slowly mov'd she down the stair,<br>  And, after morning hunger stay'd, she past<br>  To where the palace cooks and scullions bode,<br>  In kitchen vast, whence royal dainties came.<br>  All sweetness seem'd her face, and music seem'd<br>  Her voice, when she entreated one to bring<br>  His cook's white apron for her royal use,<br>  And when her maids had clad her in it, none<br>  Could think her other than a gracious Queen,<br>  Since nothing of her royal grace was hid.<br>  So following her fancy's lead, she bade<br>  The men about her bring the wheaten meal<br>  And all the kitchen tools she glibly nam'd,<br>  And place before her on a cross-legg'd stand<br>  Of smoke-gloom'd oak; and then her round white arms<br>  She plung'd up to the elbows in the meal,<br>  Her red lips murm'ring,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will serve."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, while<br>  The cooks and scullions stood with hands on hips<br>  And mouths agape to watch, she deftly mov'd<br>  About her task, and not with awkwardness,<br>  As one unus'd to kitchen toil or cares,<br>  But with all grace, such grace as won all hearts,<br>  And, ere they knew her purpose, saw before<br>  Their eyes row after row of pastry moulds,<br>  As shapely as the hands that made, and these<br>  The Queen herself in heated oven placed,<br>  And, while these brown'd in torrid darkness, sang,--<br>  For sweetly could Isolt of Ireland sing:<br>  <br>  "Ay, ay, O ay,--the winds that fan the fire!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair tarts in prospect, tarts before me here!<br>  Ay, ay, O ay,--and tarts were my desire,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was not enough, and one was dear:<br>  Ay, ay, O ay,--the winds that move so fast!<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was far, and one tart was nigher,<br>  And one will never bake, and one will last.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, ay, O ay, the winds that fan the fire!"<br>  <br>  Far up among the oaken rafters rang<br>  Her voice, and clear as is the tinkling fall<br>  Of water over rocks that chafe its course,<br>  And all within the kitchen felt such stir<br>  Within the blood as when the joyous wine<br>  Sweet summer music makes along the veins.<br>  Then one, to whom she signal'd when the strain<br>  Was ended, open threw the oven doors,<br>  And drew from warm concealment into light<br>  The tarts and bore them to Isolt, who straight<br>  Within the cup-like hollow of the tarts<br>  One after other placed with golden spoon,<br>  On which were graven deep the Cornish arms,<br>  The lucent jellies quivering like leaf<br>  Of aspen when all else is still, and sound<br>  And other motion dead within the wood.<br>  This done she bade the cooks have careful charge<br>  Of these, her tarts, till she should send, then past--<br>  Her cook's white apron doft--upward to halls<br>  Befitting her fair presence more, and, sleep<br>  And summer both at once assailing, slept.<br>  <br>  Now on the selfsame morning fair Etarre,<br>  Awaking with Sir Pelleas's sword across<br>  Her throat and Gawain's, felt her fancy turn<br>  To him who might have slain her, sleeping, yet<br>  Forbore because of former love, and said<br>  To him who lay beside her, false Gawain,<br>  "Go hence, and see me nevermore!"  The Prince,<br>  Who deem'd he knew all women's changeful ways,<br>  Laught lightly, and essayed to kiss, as oft<br>  Before, the warm white hollow of her throat.<br>  But she, recoiling, flasht such sudden wrath<br>  He, too, drew back, and slowly rose and heard<br>  From lips grown stern, from lips his own had prest,<br>  The sentence, "Go! and see me never more."<br>  Then he, much marveling on women's ways,<br>  Obey'd, and went with slow, reluctant feet<br>  Without, and mounted horse, and past across<br>  The courtyard and thro' postern portal, past<br>  Down garden slopes with musky breathings fill'd,<br>  To where the gates, wide open, led to fields<br>  And far beyond them forest shades.  Thro' these<br>  He went and wander'd on to where the walls<br>  Of Mark's great palace rose across his view.<br>  Then, for the summer noon was hot, he drew<br>  His rein beneath a giant oak that made<br>  A welcome shadow near the gate, and mus'd<br>  Yet more on changeful women's ways till came<br>  On vagrant breeze a whiff of pastry thence<br>  And woke a sudden hunger in his breast.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile in hall Isolt of Ireland slept,<br>  And slumb'rous summer silence crept o'er all<br>  The serving men and maids, till one whose care<br>  Had been the tarts to watch, a lad in years<br>  But few and wits as scant as years, awak'd<br>  From dream unquiet, and awaking, saw<br>  The Prince Gawain through kitchen gliding soft,<br>  Bearing the great, tart-laden dish.  Whereat<br>  The lad rose, terror stricken, shrieking loud,<br>  "The tarts."  Again, and like a descant, "Gone!<br>  The tarts." <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud shrill'd the cry thro'out the court,<br>  And each took up the words till rang from wall<br>  To wall the mournful echo:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gone, the tarts!"<br>  Fast swell'd the cry and louder with each voice<br>  That wail'd the theft until the Queen awak'd<br>  And hearing what had happ'd felt her heart sink<br>  And visions toothsome of the well-bak'd tarts<br>  For royal supper fade to naught, and sat<br>  To tears abandon'd and to grief a prey.<br>  <br>  But false Gawain to saddle leaping, tarts<br>  In dish upborne, saw all the rabble rout<br>  Of palace kitchen fast behind pursue,<br>  And one in saddle follow'd while the rest<br>  The shrill cry echo'd, "O, the tarts! the tarts!"<br>  Forth from the gates the chase was had until<br>  The steed of Prince Gawain stumbl'd and threw<br>  Him, bearing still the unspill'd tarts, upon<br>  A grassy bank where those who follow'd found<br>  And brought him, still tart-laden, to Isolt.<br>  <br>  Naught said Gawain to temper his disgrace,<br>  But let his eye a moment rest upon<br>  The Queen, an eye that many maidens lov'd,<br>  Then fall demurely on the toothsome tarts.<br>  That she, mov'd somewhat by his grace and glance,<br>  That admiration show'd, forgave the theft, <br>  And thinking:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo, a goodly man he seems<br>  Since Tristram is not by," upon him laid<br>  But two conditions.  First that never should<br>  He enter kitchen more in act to steal,<br>  And on his knee, down-dropping at her feet,<br>  With many oaths the courteous Gawain swore<br>  To keep from deeds like this thro' all his life;<br>  The next that he should stay and eat with her.<br>  So, nothing loth, the Prince of Courtesy stay'd<br>  And ate with her the savory, toothsome tarts<br>  For all an incense-breathing afternoon,<br>  Till one in haste appear'd when sank the sun,<br>  Crying, "I crave thy pardon, Queen, thy lord<br>  Is near."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereat Gawain, warn'd by a look<br>  Which ray'd from out her heavy-lidded eyes,<br>  Departed with a word of farewell said,<br>  And past to his own land, while she prepar'd<br>  To meet King Mark returning from the chase.<br>  <br>
