Another while was it wadded;<br>  Ill itt did her beseeme.<br>  <br>  Another while was it blacke,<br>  And bore the worst hue:<br>  "By my troth," quoth King Arthur,<br>  "I thinke thou be not

blee;<br>  Fast, with a red rudd,<br>  To her chamber can shee flee.<br>  <br>  Forth came an old knight<br>  Pattering ore a creede,<br>  And he proferred to this little boy<br>  Twenty markes to his meede,<br>  <br>  And all the time of the Christmasse,<br>  Willinglye to ffeede;<br>  For why this mantle might<br>  Doe his wiffe some need.<br>  <br>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>  Of cloth that was made,<br>  Shee had no more left on her,<br>  But a tassell and a threed:<br>  Then every knight in the kings court<br>  Bade evill might shee speed.<br>  <br>  Shee threw downe the mantle,<br>  That bright was of blee;<br>  And fast, with a redd rudd,<br>  To her chamber can shee flee.<br>  <br>  Craddocke called forth his ladye,<br>  And bade her come in;<br>  Saith, "Winne this mantle, ladye,<br>  With a litle dinne.<br>  <br>  "Winne this mantle, ladye,<br>  And it shal be thine,<br>  If thou never did amisse<br>  Since thou wast mine."<br>  <br>  Forth came Craddockes ladye,<br>  Shortlye and anon;<br>  But boldlye to the mantle<br>  Then is shee gone.<br>  <br>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>  And cast it her about,<br>  Upp att her great toe<br>  It began to crinkle and crowt:<br>  Shee said, "Bowe downe, mantle,<br>  And shame me not for nought.<br>  <br>  "Once I did amisse,<br>  I tell you certainlye,<br>  When I kist Craddockes mouth<br>  Under a
