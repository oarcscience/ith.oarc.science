An Arthurian Miscellany at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## LAUNCELOT AND GAWAINE

### by

## RICHARD HOVEY

  
  
Two women loved a poet. One was dark,  
Luxuriant with the beauty of the south,  
A heart of fire--and this one he forsook.  
The other slender, tall, with wide gray eyes,  
Who loved him with a still intensity  
That made her heart a shrine--to her he clave,  
And he was faithful to her to the end.  
And when the poet died, a song was found  
Which he had writ, of Launcelot and Gawaine;  
And when the women read it, one cried out:  
"Where got he Launcelot? Gawaine I know--  
He drew that picture from a looking-glass--  
Sleek, lying, treacherous, golden-tongued Gawaine!"  
The other, smiling, murmured "Launcelot!"
