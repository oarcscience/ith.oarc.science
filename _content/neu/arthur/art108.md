## A BALLAD OF CORNWALL

### by

## F. B. MONEY-COUTTS

  
  
I  
Sir Tristram lay by a well,  
Making sad moan;  
Fast his tears tell,  
For wild the wood through,  
Stricken with shrewd  
Sorrow, he ran,  
When he deemed her untrue --  
La Beale Isoud!  
For he loved her alone.  
  
II  
So as he lay,  
Wasted and wan,  
Scarce like a man,  
Pricking that way  
His lady-love came,  
With her damsels around,  
And her face all a-flame  
With the breezes of May;  
While a brachet beside her  
Still bayed the fair rider,  
Still leaped up and bayed her;  
A small scenting hound  
That Sir Tristram purveyed her.  
  
III  
So she rode on;  
But the brachet behind  
Hung snuffing the wind,  
Till seeking and crying  
Faster and faster,  
Beside the well lying  
She found her dear master!  
Then licking his ears  
And cheeks wet with tears,  
For joy never resting  
Kept whining and questing.  
  
IV  
Isoud (returned  
Seeking her hound)  
Soon as she learned  
Tristram was found,  
Straightway alighting,  
Fell in a swound.  
  
V  
Won by her lover  
Thence to recover,  
Who shall the greeting  
Tell of their meeting?  
Joy, by no tongue  
E'er to be sung  
Passed in that plighting!  
  
VI  
Thus while they dallied,  
Forth the wood sallied  
An horrible libbard, and bare  
The brachet away to his lair!
