Huge rock-fragments, amid which twists tortuously a great root of the tree Yggdrasil. A flickering flame, by the light of which are seen the</i>  <b> NORNS</b> , <i> colossal but shadowy shapes, about a gigantic but indistinct Loom. Dull, heavy sounds, out of which arises a strange music, which resolves itself continually into imperfect harmonies, which leave the heart in unrest. A sense of striving and struggle beats through the music.</i>  <br> <b> THE NORNS</b> . We are the Recorders!<br> We are the Finishers!<br> Nothing we initiate;<br> All things we fulfil.<br> Odin initiates<br> And Freyja and Loki,<br> Divine Balder and the other Immortals.<br> Whatsoever they begin,<br> Relentlessly we fulfil.<br> <br> Ye, too, O men, are as gods;<br> Ye are free  and the free create;<br> Ye have part in the Imperishable.<br> Ever as ye follow the Beautiful,<br> Shall the worm transfigure itself<br> And the new-born god appear.<br> But over your destinies we sit in doom;<br> Whatsoever ye begin,<br> Relentlessly we fulfil.<br> <br> Think and we seize the thought;<br> Act and the deed once done<br> Sinks into our iron hands.<br> Only the unthought thought, O man,<br> Is thine own and the deed forborne.<br> Thou canst neither love nor doubt<br> But the doubt and the love alike<br> Pass into the infrangible weft of the world<br> That we weave with inexorable fingers.<br> <br> We are the Queens of Time,<br> And, while Time is, we endure.<br> With the calm of the Empyrean<br> We mix not, neither dwell we therein;<br> But over the shifting<br> Our shuttles are inflexible.<br> God having given us Time,<br> Over Time we are greater than God.<br> We are the Finishers.<br> <br> [<i> A low, foreboding roll of thunder.--</i> <b> MERLIN</b> <i>  appears on a jutting crag in the cave, with a forked wand in his hand.--The flame flashes into sudden brilliancy, sharply defining the rocky walls of the cavern, but at once sinks back into its former weak and flickering indistinctness.--The</i>  <b> NORNS</b> <i>  remain motionless, noting none of these things, nor do they actually perceive</i>  <b> MERLIN </b> <i> at any time</i> .] <br> <b> MERLIN</b> .

I discern you not.<br> <br> <b> URD.</b>  Sisters, how should a man's eyes see the Void?<br> <br> <b> VERDANDE</b> . Shadows of clouds he scans on a searchless sea.<br> <b> <br> SKULD</b> . Between two Deeps a film of mist that shifts!<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . Shadowy ones!<br> Ye whom my eyes have seemed to see<br> Many times in the weary years!<br> Deeper and darker the riddle appears;<br> Muddier the river runs.<br> What are ye, Darknesses? Whence have ye risen?<br> Are ye or seem ye? What is it to seem or to be?<br> With the same awe I re-behold you<br> As when I first clave o'er the unroadwayed sea<br> And through the cavernous darks of Hecla's womb<br> The way to Odin's tomb--<br> To your earth-bound prison.<br> <br> <b> VERDANDE</b> . The shuttle flies. The noise of men far off<br> Breaks faintly on our ears like a distant surf.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . Prison, I call it, I hold you--<br> You, the Resistless, Monarchs of Days--<br> As verily slaves as we.<br> Slaves of the stone sceptre your own hands wield<br> Over the weirds of the world--<br> Or of some mightier Silence whose ways<br> I find not without me revealed<br> Nor within me enfurled.<br> <br> <b> URD</b> . I hear a voice above the noise of men,<br> Like a bird's thin shriek shrilling o'er the surf.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> .

The surf booms on, the billows break and cease,<br> And the gull's cry dissolves into the wind.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . Answer my thought!<br> Ye have answered before,--<br> So mightily wrought<br> My strenuous lore.<br> By the wand in my hand<br> I command you to show<br> All the veils may conceal,<br> That it ails me to know.<br> Man and wife, is it weal?<br> Man and wife, is it woe?<br> Ye see not the wand;<br> Ye see not the mage:<br> As two straws in your hand<br> Are the fool and the sage.<br> Ye know not I utter;<br> Ye know not ye heed;<br> But the words that ye mutter<br> Shall answer my need.<br> Speak!<br> <br> <b> VERDANDE</b> .

Weal for the lovers, after many days!<br> <br> <b> URD</b> . Ay, but they first shall sail a bitter sea!<br> <br> <b> SKULD</b> . Weal for the King, but not till the kingdom pass!<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . Weal and woe!<br> A dark saying!<br> Yeaing and naying!<br> How shall I know?<br> <br> <b> URD</b> . The seer and the seeing and the seen--<br> Are not these three things known and yet unknown?<br> <br> <b> VERDANDE</b> . To live is better far than not to live--<br> Yea, and to live is worse than not to live.<br> <br> <b> SKULD</b> . The womb--the tomb--and each of these is all--<br> And he that acts, is wise and is unwise.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . A womb and a tomb!<br> No more?<br> <br> <b> VERDANDE</b> . Who weds this woman hath a royal wife.<br> <br> <b> URD</b> . Behold the man she loves, a king of men!<br> <br> <b> SKULD</b> . Each man must choose his wife and bide his lot.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . She loves the Prince!--<br> A queenly one!--<br> Whom else should he wed?<br> Who else should share his throne?<br> Daughters of Time! ye speak and convince.<br> I have chosen a way to tread.<br> <br> <b> URD</b> . Marriage the calm gods give, a crown of life;<br> Marriage we give, not they, a kissing curse.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . A rhymeless Rune--<br> Is and Is Not.<br> Solve me the riddle!<br> Is there no overword?<br> <br> <b> VERDANDE</b> . Darkness and light ring round the globe of things,<br> And each pursues the other as it flies.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . Know ye the wand?<br> With the wand I compel you.<br> <br> <b> SKULD</b> . A Dragon slaying forever a deathless Queen!<br> There is no wit in us to make this clear.<br> <br> <b> MERLIN</b> . Not in you?<br> Where then?  In myself?<br> [<i> He strikes his own forehead with the wand.-- A black formless mark appears on his brow.--He falls in a swoon.</i> ] <br> <b> THE NORNS</b> .

Sweet goddess, raise thy veil! . . . A dream, a dream!<br> Methought that I was in the utter night.<br> So black it was, sight was not, nay, nor thought--<br> Only a sense of falling.  Suddenly <br> A great light shone about me and a form, <br> As of a potent goddess, moved across<br> The circle of my sight.  Queen-like, she wore<br> A threefold crown, and in her hand she kept<br> A mirror wherein, wonderfully glassed,<br> Meseemed I saw the mystery of things--<br> Wried in a sort but rimmed about with wonder.<br> And by her side there crawled a shackled slave<br> That kissed the mirror.  From her head there fell<br> A veil that clad whatever form she bore<br> In awful folds, so that I could not see<br> If she were fair or foul.  Yet from her gait<br> A sound came singing, as it were the voice<br> Of many dulcimers.  Whereat I cried<br> Aloud and woke. . . What vale is this?

This is a dream. . .<br> What eyes are those that peer between the leaves<br> With laughter in their looking?

Through the opening a car rises, drawn by dragons.</i>   <b> NIMUE</b>  <i> enters the car and extends her hand to</i>  <b> MERLIN</b>  <i> who follows her.  The car rises into the air and disappears in the distance</i> .] <br> <b> ARGENTE</b> .  With grinning jaws<br> They gape horridly,<br> Bearing him back where body and soul<br> Gnaw juiceless bones continually.<br> Jag-toothed dragons, shutting and opening your eyes<br> With hideous slowness!<br> In my soul, too, is a hunger.<br> Ai, ai!<br> The bite of the tooth in flesh that cannot waste!<br> <br> <b> MAIDENS</b> .  Comfort thee, O our Queen!<br> Sorrow is dear to the wise,<br> Who know that Love is leading,<br> And believe--for have they not seen?<br> Mystery of mysteries!<br> The crowned brow is bleeding.<br> <br> <b> ARGENTE</b> .  Alas, my sisters! you are good to me.<br> Your presence is as starlight to my spirit.<br> Your words are as a bird's song in the trees<br> When all the woodland sorrows under clouds.<br> I know the end is sweet--I see it plain,<br> As the jay yonder the bough to which it flies.<br> But oh, the way is long and the heart weak!<br> Is the physician's wound less sore<br> Because his cunning knows that it will heal?<br> The fallen warrior<br> With the broken shaft of the spear driven as a nail<br> Through muscle, sinew, bone, lung, heart--<br> Feels he not, though Valhalla open<br> And the Valkyrs wait with cup and crown,<br> Sharp anguish, intolerable gaspings that pierce<br> Each with keen torture the frayed nerves, killing him<br> A hundred times for once?<br> Ai, ai!<br> It is not all a good to see the things<br> That shall be.  He that will soar to topmost heaven,<br> Must plunge, too, down to the voiceless lowest of hell.<br> Ye shall not know the good without the evil,<br> Saith the Lord God.<br> Ai, ai!  I see the maiden stand in the choir.<br> The royal robes are girt upon her.  Priests<br> And choristers intone monotonously.<br> The sunlight falling bloodily through the panes,<br> Is dim and thick with incense.  The King comes!<br> I see him take her fatal hand in his.<br> Otototoi!  The breath of the god<br> Tingles on my forehead!<br> My flesh quivers with its power!<br> The dread that hung over me sunders as a cloud.<br> A sunlit garden--lay this behind the gloom?<br> And he--is he my fear?<br> Beautiful as Balder he stands by the beautiful queen,<br> High-thoughted, kingly as a cedar.<br> From the high hills the woe cometh,<br> A desolating avalanche! . . . . <br> The scabbard, Arthur!<br> Quick!  The intriguing fingers close on it.<br> Awake!  The sword itself is less precious.  Ah! . .<br> Woe! woe!<br> The stark bodies of the slain!--<br> Spare me, Spirit that overbroods me!<br> I endure not the vision!<br> I am slain with intense whirling of tumultuous life!<br> Back, bodeful clouds!  Once again, as with inrolling waters,<br> Engulf the insufferable sight!<br> Otototoi!<br> The din of shields and the shouts of the warriors!<br> The death-birds hovering afar off! . . . .<br> Where is he, my king, my beloved?<br> Over the sea-like sparkle of shields I seek him--in vain.<br> Ah, ah!<br> There, in the crest of the war-surf--<br> Arthur, Arthur!<br> He struggles toward the treacherous chief.  Their swords clash.<br> O valiant prince!  O misbegotten traitor! . . . .<br> He falls--the King!  the King!<br> The battle sweeps away like a black cloud.<br> What, ho! a rescue! knights! Kaye! Bedevere!<br> Quick!  To the lake! to the lake!<br> Arthur, I wait for thee!<br> <br> [<i> She falls back exhausted and is surrounded by her maidens, screening her from sight</i> .]<br> <br> <b> MAIDENS</b> .  Comfort thee, O our Queen!<br>    Through warring and woe<br>       The man and the woman<br>          Build heaven for themselves.<br>          From the deeps where it delves<br>       Uplifted, the human<br>          Soars to the divine,<br> Though the void intervene.<br>    Pierce through the veils and lo,<br>       The sevenfold light of the shrine!<br> <br> 		[<i> Exeunt slowly, singing</i> .]<br> <br> <br> <b> ANGELS</b>  [<i> above</i> ].
