An Arthurian Miscellany at Intangible Textual Heritage

## THE EGYPTIAN MAID OR THE ROMANCE OF THE WATER-LILY

### by

## WILLIAM WORDSWORTH

  
\[For the names and persons in the following poem, see the "History of
the renowned Prince Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table;" for the
rest the Author is answerable; only it may be proper to add, that the
Lotus, with the bust of the goddess apppearing to rise out of the
full-blown flower, was suggested by the beautiful work of ancient art,
once included among the Townley Marbles, and now in the British
Museum.\]  
  
  
While Merlin paced the Cornish sands,  
Forth-looking toward the Rocks of Scilly,  
The pleased Enchanter was aware  
Of a bright Ship that seemed to hang in air,  
Yet was she work of mortal hands,  
And took from men her name--THE WATER LILY.  
  
Soft was the wind, that landward blew;  
And, as the Moon, o'er some dark hill ascendant,  
Grows from a little edge of light  
To a full orb, this Pinnace bright,  
As nearer to the Coast she drew,  
Appeared more glorious, with spread sail and pendant.  
  
Upon this winged Shape so fair  
Sage Merlin gazed with admiration:  
Her lineaments, thought he, surpass  
Aught that was ever shown in magic glass;  
In patience built with subtle care;  
Or, at a touch, set forth with wondrous transformation.  
  
Now, though a Mechanist, whose skill  
Shames the degenerate grasp of modern science,  
Grave Merlin (and belike the more  
For practising occult and perilous lore)  
Was subject to a freakish will  
That sapped good thoughts, or scared them with defiance.  
  
Provoked to envious spleen, he cast  
An altered look upon the advancing Stranger  
Whom he had hailed with joy, and cried,  
"My Art shall help to tame her pride--"  
Anon the breeze became a blast,  
And the waves rose, and sky portended danger.  
  
With thrilling word, and potent sign  
Traced on the beach, his work the Sorcerer urges;  
The clouds in blacker clouds are lost,  
Like spiteful Fiends that vanish, crossed  
By Fiends of aspect more malign;  
And the winds roused the Deep with fiercer scourges.  
  
But worthy of the name she bore  
Was this Sea-flower, this buoyant Galley;  
Supreme in loveliness and grace  
Of motion, whether in the embrace  
Of trusty anchorage, or scudding o'er  
The main flood roughened into hill and valley.  
  
Behold, how wantonly she laves  
Her sides, the Wizard's craft confounding;  
Like something out of Ocean sprung  
To be for ever fresh and young,  
Breasts the sea-flashes, and huge waves  
Top-gallant high, rebounding and rebounding!  
  
But Ocean under magic heaves,  
And cannot spare the Thing he cherished:  
Ah! what avails that She was fair,  
Luminous, blithe, and debonair?  
The storm has stripped her of her leaves;  
The Lily floats no longer!--She hath perished.  
  
Grieve for her,--She deserves no less;  
So like, yet so unlike, a living Creature!  
No heart had she, no busy brain;  
Though loved, she could not love again;  
Though pitied, feel her own distress;  
Nor aught that troubles us, the fools of Nature.  
  
Yet is there cause for gushing tears;  
So richly was this Galley laden;  
A fairer than Herself she bore,  
And, in her struggles, cast ashore;  
A lovely One, who nothing hears  
Of wind or wave--a meek and guileless Maiden.  
  
Into a cave had Merlin fled  
From mischief, caused by spells himself had muttered;  
And, while repentant all too late,  
In moody posture there he sate,  
He heard a voice, and saw, with half-raised head,  
A Visitant by whom these words were uttered:  
  
"On Christian service this frail Bark  
Sailed" (hear me, Merlin!) "under high protection,  
Though on her prow a sign of heathen power  
Was carved--a Goddess with a Lily flower,  
The old Egyptian's emblematic mark  
Of joy immortal and of pure affection.  
  
"Her course was for the British strand,  
Her freight it was a Damsel peerless;  
God reigns above, and Spirits strong  
May gather to avenge this wrong  
Done to the Princess, and her Land  
Which she in duty left, though sad not cheerless.  
  
"And to Caerleon's loftiest tower  
Soon will the Knights of Arthur's Table  
A cry of lamentation send;  
And all will weep who there attend,  
To grace that Stranger's bridal hour,  
For whom the sea was made unnavigable.  
  
"Shame! should a Child of Royal Line  
Die through the blindness of thy malice:"  
Thus to the Necromancer spake  
Nina, the Lady of the Lake,  
A gentle Sorceress, and benign,  
Who ne'er embittered any good man's chalice.  
  
"What boots," continued she, "to mourn?  
To expiate thy sin endeavour!  
From the bleak isle where she is laid,  
Fetched by our art, the Egyptian Maid  
May yet to Arthur's court be borne  
Cold as she is, ere life be fled for ever.  
  
"My pearly Boat, a shining Light,  
That brought me down that sunless river,  
Will bear me on from wave to wave,  
And back with her to this sea-cave;  
Then Merlin! for a rapid flight  
Through air to thee my charge will I deliver.  
  
"The very swiftest of thy Cars  
Must, when my part is done, be ready;  
Meanwhile, for further guidance, look  
Into thy own prophetic book;  
And, if that fail, consult the Stars  
To learn thy course; farewell! be prompt and steady."  
  
This scarcely spoken, she again  
Was seated in her gleaming Shallop,  
That, o'er the yet-distempered Deep,  
Pursued its way with bird-like sweep,  
Or like a steed, without a rein,  
Urged o'er the wilderness in sportive gallop.  
  
Soon did the gentle Nina reach  
That Isle without a house or haven;  
Landing, she found not what she sought,  
Nor saw of wreck or ruin aught  
But a carved Lotus cast upon the shore  
By the fierce waves, a flower in marble graven.  
  
Sad relique, but how fair the while!  
For gently each from each retreating  
With backward curve, the leaves revealed  
The bosom half, and half concealed,  
Of a Divinity, that seemed to smile  
On Nina as she passed, with hopeful greeting.  
  
No quest was hers of vague desire,  
Of tortured hope and purpose shaken;  
Following the margin of a bay,  
She spied the lonely Cast-away,  
Unmarred, unstripped of her attire,  
But with closed eyes,--of breath and bloom forsaken.  
  
Then Nina, stooping down, embraced,  
With tenderness and mild emotion,  
The Damsel, in that trance embound;  
And, while she raised her from the ground,  
And in the pearly shallop placed,  
Sleep fell upon the air, and stilled the ocean.  
  
The turmoil hushed, celestial springs  
Of music opened, and there came a blending  
Of fragrance, underived from earth,  
With gleams that owed not to the Sun their birth,  
And that soft rustling of invisible wings  
Which Angels make, on works of love descending.  
  
And Nina heard a sweeter voice  
Than if the Goddess of the Flower had spoken:  
"Thou hast achieved, fair Dame! what none  
Less pure in spirit could have done;  
Go, in thy enterprise rejoice!  
Air, earth, sea, sky, and heaven, success betoken."  
  
So cheered she left that Island bleak,  
A bare rock of the Scilly cluster;  
And, as they traversed the smooth brine,  
The self-illumined Brigantine  
Shed, on the Slumberer's cold wan cheek  
And pallid brow, a melancholy lustre.  
  
Fleet was their course, and when they came  
To the dim cavern, whence the river  
Issued into the salt-sea flood,  
Merlin, as fixed in thought he stood,  
Was thus accosted by the Dame:  
"Behold to thee my Charge I now deliver!  
  
"But where attends thy chariot--where?"  
Quoth Merlin, "Even as I was bidden,  
So have I done; as trusty as thy barge  
My vehicle shall prove--O precious Charge!  
If this be sleep, how soft! if death, how fair!  
Much have my books disclosed, but the end is hidden."  
  
He spake, and gliding into view  
Forth from the grotto's dimmest chamber  
Came two mute Swans, whose plumes of dusky white  
Changed, as the pair approached the light,  
Drawing an ebon car, their hue  
(Like clouds of sunset) into lucid amber.  
  
Once more did gentle Nina lift  
The Princess, passive to all changes:  
The car received her; then up-went  
Into the ethereal element  
The Birds with progress smooth and swift  
As thought, when through bright regions memory ranges.  
  
Sage Merlin, at the Slumberer's side,  
Instructs the Swans their way to measure;  
And soon Caerleon's towers appeared,  
And notes of minstrelsy were heard  
From rich pavilions spreading wide,  
For some high day of long-expected pleasure.  
  
Awe-stricken stood both Knights and Dames  
Ere on firm ground the car alighted;  
Eftsoons astonishment was past,  
For in that face they saw the last  
Last lingering look of clay, that tames  
All pride, by which all happiness is blighted.  
  
Said Merlin, "Mighty King, fair Lords,  
Away with feast and tilt and tourney!  
Ye saw, throughout this Royal House,  
Ye heard, a rocking marvellous  
Of turrets, and a clash of swords  
Self-shaken, as I closed my airy journey.  
  
"Lo! by a destiny well known  
To mortals, joy is turned to sorrow;  
This is the wished-for Bride, the Maid  
Of Egypt, from a rock conveyed  
Where she by shipwreck had been thrown;  
Ill sight! but grief may vanish ere the morrow."  
  
"Though vast thy power, thy words are weak,"  
Exclaimed the King, "a mockery hateful;  
Dutiful Child! her lot how hard!  
Is this her piety's reward?  
Those watery locks, that bloodless cheek!  
O winds without remorse! O shore ungrateful!  
  
"Rich robes are fretted by the moth;  
Towers, temples, fall by stroke of thunder;  
Will that, or deeper thoughts, abate  
A Father's sorrow for her fate?  
He will repent him of his troth;  
His brain will burn, his stout heart split asunder.  
  
"Alas! and I have caused this woe;  
For, when my prowess from invading Neighbours  
Had freed his Realm, he plighted word  
That he would turn to Christ our Lord,  
And his dear Daughter on a Knight bestow  
Whom I should choose for love and matchless labours.  
  
"Her birth was heathen, but a fence  
Of holy Angels round her hovered;  
A Lady added to my court  
So fair, of such divine report  
And worship, seemed a recompence  
For fifty kingdoms by my sword recovered.  
  
"Ask not for whom, O champions true!  
She was reserved by me her life's betrayer;  
She who was meant to be a bride  
Is now a corse; then put aside  
Vain thoughts, and speed ye, with observance due  
Of Christian rites, in Christian ground to lay her."  
  
"The tomb," said Merlin, "may not close  
Upon her yet, earth hide her beauty;  
Not froward to thy sovereign will  
Esteem me, Liege! if I, whose skill  
Wafted her hither, interpose  
To check this pious haste of erring duty.  
  
"My books command me to lay bare  
The secret thou art bent on keeping;  
Here must a high attest be given,  
What Bridegroom was for her ordained by Heaven;  
And in my glass significants there are  
Of things that may to gladness turn this weeping.  
  
"For this, approaching, One by One,  
Thy Knights must touch the cold hand of the Virgin;  
So, for the favoured One, the Flower may bloom  
Once more; but, if unchangeagble her doom,  
If life departed be for ever gone,  
Some blest assurance, from this cloud emerging,  
  
May teach him to bewail his loss;  
Not with a grief that, like a vapour, rises  
And melts; but grief devout that shall endure  
And a perpetual growth secure  
Of purposes which no false thought shall cross  
A harvest of high hopes and noble enterprises."  
  
"So be it," said the King;--"anon,  
Here, where the Princess lies, begin the trial;  
Knights each in order as ye stand  
Step forth."--To touch the pallid hand  
Sir Agravaine advanced; no sign he won  
From Heaven or Earth;--Sir Kaye had like denial.  
  
Abashed, Sir Dinas turned away;  
Even for Sir Percival was no disclosure;  
Though he, devoutest of all Champions, ere  
He reached that ebon car, the bier  
Whereon diffused like snow the Damsel lay,  
Full thrice had crossed himself in meek composure.  
  
Imagine (but ye Saints! who can?)  
How in still air the balance trembled;  
The wishes, peradventure the despites  
That overcame some not ungenerous Knights;  
And all the thoughts that lengthened out a span  
Of time to Lords and Ladies thus assembled.  
  
What patient confidence was here!  
And there how many bosoms panted!  
While drawing toward the Car Sir Gawaine, mailed  
For tournament, his Beaver vailed,  
And softly touched; but, to his princely cheer  
And high expectancy, no sign was granted.  
  
Next, disencumbered of his harp,  
Sir Tristram, dear to thousands as a brother,  
Came to the proof, nor grieved that there ensued  
No change;--the fair Izonda he had wooed  
With love too true, a love with pangs too sharp,  
From hope too distant, not to dread another.  
  
Not so Sir Launcelot;--from Heaven's grace  
A sign he craved, tired slave of vain contrition;  
The royal Guinever looked passing glad  
When his touch failed.--Next came Sir Galahad;  
He paused, and stood entranced by that still face  
Whose features he had seen in noontide vision.  
  
For late, as near a murmuring stream  
He rested 'mid an arbour green and shady,  
Nina, the good Enchantress, shed  
A light around his mossy bed;  
And, at her call, a waking dream  
Prefigured to his sense the Egyptian Lady.  
  
Now, while the bright-haired front he bowed,  
And stood, far-kenned by mantle furred with ermine,  
As o'er the insensate Body hung  
The enrapt, the beautiful, the young,  
Belief sank deep into the crowd  
That he the solemn issue would determine.  
  
Nor deem it strange; the Youth had worn  
That very mantle on a day of glory,  
The day when he achieved that matchless feat,  
The marvel of the PERILOUS SEAT,  
Which whosoe'er approached of strength was shorn,  
Though King or Knight the most renowned in story.  
  
He touched with hesitating hand,  
And lo! those Birds, far-famed through Love's dominions,  
The Swans, in triumph clap their wings;  
And their necks play, involved in rings,  
Like sinless snakes in Eden's happy land;--  
"Mine is she," cried the Knight;--again they clapped their pinions.  
  
"Mine was she--mine she is, though dead,  
And to her name my soul shall cleave in sorrow;"  
Whereat, a tender twilight streak  
Of colour dawned upon the Damsel's cheek;  
And her lips, quickening with uncertain red,  
Seemed from each other a faint warmth to borrow  
  
Deep was the awe, the rapture high,  
Of love emboldened, hope with dread entwining,  
When, to the mouth, relenting Death  
Allowed a soft and flower-like breath,  
Precursor to a timid sigh,  
To lifted eyelids, and a doubtful shining.  
  
In silence did King Arthur gaze  
Upon the signs that pass away or tarry;  
In silence watched the gentle strife  
Of Nature leading back to life;  
Then eased his Soul at length by praise  
Of God, and Heaven's pure Queen--the blissful Mary.  
  
Then said he, "Take her to thy heart  
Sir Galahad! a treasure that God giveth  
Bound by indissoluble ties to thee  
Through mortal change and immortality;  
Be happy and unenvied, thou who art  
A goodly Knight that hath no Peer that liveth!"  
  
Not long the Nuptials were delayed;  
And sage tradition still rehearses  
The pomp the glory of that hour  
When toward the Altar from her bower  
King Arthur led the Egyptian Maid,  
And Angels carolled these far-echoed verses;--  
  
Who shrinks not from alliance  
Of evil with good Powers,  
To God proclaims defiance,  
And mocks whom he adores.  
  
A Ship to Christ devoted  
From the Land of Nile did go;  
Alas! the bright Ship floated,  
An Idol at her Prow.  
  
By magic domination  
The Heaven-permitted vent  
Of purblind mortal passion,  
Was wrought her punishment.  
  
The Flower, the Form within it,  
What served they in her need?  
Her port she could not win it,  
Nor from mishap be freed.  
  
The tempest overcame her,  
And she was seen no more;  
But gently gently blame her,  
She cast a Pearl ashore.  
  
The Maid to Jesu hearkened,  
And kept to him her faith,  
Till sense in death was darkened,  
Or sleep akin to death.  
  
But Angels round her pillow  
Kept watch, a viewless band;  
And, billow favouring billow,  
She reached the destined strand.  
  
Blest Pair! whate'er befall you,  
Your faith in Him approve  
Who from frail earth can call you,  
To bowers of endless love!
