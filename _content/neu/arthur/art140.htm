That the battle might be fought again!<br>  Then would I surely seek the way to death,<br>  And bleed and sleep like you, and be at peace.<br>  But now, ah!  whither, whither can I go,<br>  Since he is gone who was my light of life,<br>  And whom to see was bliss?  What can I do<br>  Without the voice that gave my arm its strength?<br>  Or wherefore bear a sword, since now no more<br>  Excalibur points forth to noble deeds?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he drew his blade, and threw it far<br>  Into the Lake, and as he saw it sink,<br>  "Would God," said he, "that so I followed him." <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the strain his wounds began to bleed,<br>  And he grew weak, and sank upon the ground,<br>  And swooned.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he woke, he was aware<br>  Of Merlin, who stood watching by his side.<br>  Then cried Sir Bedivere:  "O good and wise,<br>  I bid thee welcome, for, in all the world,<br>  There is none other I would fainer see.<br>  Yet am I sad to see thee, for the King<br>  Is gone, and none is left of all his Knights<br>  Save me, and I am weary of my life."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Merlin, ere he answered, staunched his wound,<br>  And gave him wine out of a golden flask,<br>  And, by the healing art which he possessed,<br>  Restored him sound and whole.  And then he spake:<br>  "There is no need to tell me, for I know<br>  All thou would'st say, and knew ere thou wast born<br>  That all these things should be.  But weep no more,<br>  Sir Bedivere.  The past no man can change,<br>  Nor make what has been other than it is.<br>  As in the forest of Broceliande,<br>  The leaves fall year by year, and give the oaks<br>  All bare to wintry blasts, so, swept apace<br>  Before the breath of Time, the race of men<br>  Passes away, and may be seen no more.<br>  And yet the breeze of Spring is no less sweet,<br>  Which plays around the tender budding leaves,<br>  And calls to life their beauty, that it is<br>  As well a requiem as baby-song.<br>  So weep not for the days that are no more,<br>  But pray, as the King bade thee, for his soul,<br>  That to his far-off home no sigh may come<br>  From this, his orphan and unhappy realm,<br>  To mar the melody of Avalon."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said Sir Bedivere:  "O good and wise,<br>  Will he return again to Camelot,<br>  After his wound is healed, and Guinevere<br>  Has healed that other wound that vexed his soul,<br>  By purging her own soul of all offence?<br>  And will he not assemble round his board<br>  The best and bravest knights of Christendom,<br>  And all the fairest ladies of the land,<br>  And reign as erst he reigned in Camelot?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Merlin:  "Hid from eyes of common men<br>  Is that which is to be in after days;<br>  And only those can see it in whose souls<br>  A heavenly brightness has dissolved the mist<br>  That darkens mortal sight.  And even these<br>  Can see but dimly, as a far-off hill<br>  Appears at even when the stars surprise<br>  The lingering kisses of the parting sun.<br>  But I, thou knowest well, Sir Bedivere,<br>  Am not of mortal race, nor was I born<br>  Of human mother nor of human sire.<br>  Mine is the blazonry of prophet souls<br>  Whose lineage finds in God its kingly head.<br>  To me what was and that which is to come<br>  Are ever present, and I grow not old<br>  With time, but have the gift of endless youth.<br>  As one who stands beside a placid stream,<br>  Watching the white sails passing slowly down,<br>  And knows a fatal whirlpool waits them all,<br>  And yet, the while, is powerless to save,--<br>  So watch I all the ages passing by<br>  Adown the stream of time into the gulf<br>  From which is no return.  Alas!  Alas!<br>  How oft have I, who ever love the good,<br>  The pure, the brave and wise, wept bitter tears,<br>  As they have passed me, joyous in their course,<br>  And we have held sweet converse, as I thought<br>  How soon their faces would be seen no more!<br>  Sad, sad, Sir Bedivere, the prophet's gift,<br>  Who sees the evil which he cannot heal!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a gloom o'ershadowed Merlin's face,<br>  That caused Sir Bedivere to pity him;<br>  And they both wept, as one, amid the dead,<br>  Thinking of all the sorrows of the world.<br>  But Merlin, when his face grew calm again,<br>  Began:  "Come, hearken now, Sir Bedivere,<br>  and I will give an answer to thy quest:<br>  King Arthur sleeps in Avalon, and many a change<br>  Must over-pass this land before he wake.<br>  The great White Dragon of the stormy North,<br>  Rearing his crest above the foaming waves,<br>  Shall shake the ground, and level all the hills,--<br>  And war shall follow war,--and blood shall flow<br>  In every vale,--and smoke of burning towns<br>  Shall reach the sky,--and men shall cry for aid<br>  Unto the sea, to hide them from the foe--<br>  And still shall Arthur sleep in Avalon.<br>  <br>  And when the Dragon, sated with the blood<br>  Of Christian men and women, yields at length<br>  To a mild victor, Tigers of the Sea<br>  Shall come, from cragy homes, to rend and tear,<br>  And brave men's hearts shall quail before their eyes--<br>  Yet still shall Arthur sleep in Avalon.<br>  <br>  The Tigers' wrath appeased, another foe<br>  Shall wave a foreign banner o'er the land,<br>  And trample down beneath his horses' hoofs<br>  Briton, and Dane, and Saxon, till the ground<br>  Is rank with blood, as when upon the slopes<br>  Of Badon Arthur charged the heathen host--<br>  Yet still the King shall sleep in Avalon.<br>  <br>  But as the ages pass, these foes shall join<br>  In friendship, and a nation shall arise,<br>  Like a strong oak amid the forest trees,<br>  Which, growing slowly, ceases not to grow,<br>  But fastens firmly, as it aims aloft,<br>  And spreads its branches far on every side,<br>  A shelter to the stranger of all lands--<br>  While Arthur still sleeps on in Avalon.<br>  <br>  And many Kings shall rule and win renown<br>  For this now saddened and distracted realm;<br>  And Britain shall be great by land and sea,<br>  And stretch her conquering arms around the world,<br>  And gather treasures from all climes, and teach<br>  Her tongues to distant nations, and her name<br>  Shall be a word of praise to all the earth--<br>  While Arthur still sleeps on in Avalon.<br>  But though he sleep, he still shall wear the crown<br>  As rightful lord of Britain, for on him,--<br>  The image of a noble Christian King,<br>  The image of a ruler sent of God,--<br>  The people still shall look in whoso reigns.<br>  And if there be a King of soul impure--<br>  Or if there be a King of hand unjust--<br>  Or if there be a King who weighs himself<br>  Against the nation's weal (such Kings there are<br>  And ever shall be until Arthur wake),--<br>  It is the <i> real</i>  King the people serve,<br>  The Blameless Prince that never can do wrong,<br>  And not the false usurper of his name."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, wondering much, broke in Sir Bedivere:<br>  "O Merlin, thou art far too wise for me,<br>  Though well I love thy speech.  But, in good sooth,<br>  And plainly, as we speak of common things,<br>  Answer me:  Will the King come back again<br>  In his own fleshly guise, the very same<br>  As when he feasted erst in Camelot<br>  With all the Table Round?  And will he wear<br>  The crown, and gird him with Excalibur,<br>  And conquer heathen foes, and rid the land<br>  Of all that speaketh lies or doeth wrong?--<br>  Or, must he sleep for ever, and his face<br>  Be hid away from those that love him well?<br>  For, if I thought that it were so to be,<br>  I never could have comfort in my life."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answered Merlin:  "Let me tell my tale<br>  In my own way, and hearken till the close.<br>  All these things happen not as we desire,<br>  But as the ages need.  Such men as he<br>  Come not without great travail and sore pain;<br>  They are the ripe fruit of the centuries,<br>  Who nourish noble thoughts and noble deeds,<br>  Give health and vigour to the sickly times,<br>  And stir the gross blood of the sleepy world;<br>  And when they pass away, their names, endued<br>  With life, still head the van of truth and right:<br>  So shall the name and spirit of the King,<br>  Who ruled in Camelot the Table Round,<br>  Guide Britain into ever-growing fame;<br>  And all her Kings that reign shall reign in him,<br>  The golden type of kingly chivalry.<br>  And those three Queens thou sawest, three fair Queens,<br>  So sweet and womanly, who, in the barge,<br>  Bore, tenderly, away the wounded King,<br>  Shall reign in Britain in the after-time,--<br>  As, in the old time, Carismandua<br>  And brave Bonduca whom the Romans feared<br>  Held a firm sceptre in a gentle hand.<br>  Of best and purest Queenhood, they, the type,<br>  As Arthur is the type of Blameless Kings.<br>  And as by three sweet names of holy kin<br>  They shall be known, so shall they also shew<br>  A triple sisterhood beneath one crown--<br>  Britain, and Albyn, and green Innisfail.<br>  <br>  Now, when the last of three Queens has slept<br>  For many years, there shall arise a Fourth--<br>  Fair, good and wise, and loved by all the land<br>  Of Britain, and by many lands on every sea.<br>  And in her days the world shall have much changed<br>  From that which now we live in.  Mysteries,<br>  Save unto me in vision, now unknown,<br>  Shall then be clear as day.  The earth and air<br>  Shall yield strange secrets for the use of men,--<br>  The planets, in their courses, shall draw near,<br>  And men shall see their marvels, as the flowers<br>  That grace the meads of Summer,--time and space<br>  Shall know new laws, and history shall walk<br>  Abreast with fact o'er all the peopled world:--<br>  For words shall flash like light from shore to shore,<br>  And light itself shall chronicle men's deeds.<br>  Great ships shall plough the ocean without sail,<br>  And steedless chariots shoot with arrowy speed<br>  O'er hill and dale and river, and beneath<br>  The solid floor we tread,--the silent rocks<br>  Shall tell the story of the infant world,--<br>  The falling leaf shall shew the cause of things<br>  Sages have sought in vain--and the whole vast<br>  Of sight and sound shall be to men a school<br>  Where they may learn strange lessons; and great truths<br>  That long have slept in the deep heart of God<br>  Shall waken and come forth and dwell with men,<br>  As in the elder days the tented lord<br>  Of countless herds was taught by angel-guests.<br>  And this fair land of Britain then shall be<br>  Engrailed with stately cities,--and by streams<br>  Where now the greedy wolf roams shall be heard<br>  The multitudinous voice of Industry,--<br>  And Labour, incense-crowned, shall hold her court<br>  Where now the sun scarce touches with his beams<br>  The scattered seeds of future argosies,<br>  That to the furthest limit of the world<br>  Shall bear the glory of the British name.<br>  And where a Grecian victor never trod,<br>  And where a Roman banner never waved,<br>  East, West, and North, and South, and to those Isles,<br>  Happy and rich, of which the poets dreamed<br>  But never saw, set far in Western seas,<br>  Beyond the pillars of the heathen god--<br>  Shall Arthur's realm extend, and dusky Kings<br>  Shall yield obeisance to his conquering fame.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she, the fourth fair tenant of the throne,<br>  Heir to the ripe fruit of long centuries,<br>  Shall reign o'er such an empire, and her name,<br>  Clasping the trophies of all ages, won<br>  By knightly deeds in every land and sea,<br>  Shall be VICTORIA.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall come a Prince<br>  From o'er the sea, of goodly mien and fair,<br>  And, winning her, win all that she has won--<br>  Wedded to her, be good as she is pure--<br>  Reigning with her, be wise as she is great--<br>  And, loving her, be loved by all the world."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake Sir Bedivere, all eagerly:<br>  "He, Merlin, is he not our Blameless King,<br>  Returned from his long sleep in Avalon,<br>  To crown the glories of the later world?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Merlin:  "Wait a while, Sir Bedivere,<br>  And I will tell thee all.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deeds of war,--<br>  The rage of battle, and the clangorous charge<br>  Of mail&eacute;d knights, and flash of hostile swords,<br>  And flying spears, and din of meeting shields,<br>  And all the use of man-ennobling might<br>  For Christ and for his Cross, to wrest the land<br>  From heathen foes--did Arthur win his fame.<br>  For this, by marvels, was he born and bred;<br>  For this, by marvels, was he chosen King;<br>  For this he sent his heralds to all parts<br>  Of the divided realm, to summon forth<br>  All bravest, truest knights of Christendom<br>  From rude and selfish war to Camelot,<br>  That they might be one heart around himself<br>  To send new life-blood through the sickly land,<br>  And purge it of the plague of heathennesse.<br>  And had not the foul falsehood of his house<br>  Broken athwart the true aim of his life,<br>  And set the Table Round against itself,<br>  Ere now the heathen Dragon had been crushed,<br>  Never again to raise its hideous head<br>  O'er the fair land that Christ's apostle blessed.<br>  <br>  This was the purpose that his soul had formed--<br>  Alas!  How unaccomplished!--and he hoped<br>  That gentle peace would be the meed of war,--<br>  That 'neath the laurel fair and wide would bloom<br>  The flowers of wisdom, charity and truth,--<br>  That holy men and sages, ladies fair<br>  And famous knights, and those that from earth's lap<br>  Gather God's bounties, and the men whose hands<br>  Have skilful touch, and those who tell or sing<br>  Of Nature and her marvels, or who fill<br>  The scroll with records of the misty past,<br>  And others of all arts and all degrees,<br>  Should work, each in the place that he had found,<br>  With one pure impulse in the heart of all,--<br>  That Britain should be called of all the world<br>  A blameless people round a Blameless King.<br>  <br>  This purpose Albert, in the after-time,<br>  (So shall the Prince be named of whom I spake,)<br>  Shall take from the dim shrine where it has lain,<br>  Scarce touched by dreamy reverence, many an age,<br>  And hold it in the daylight of his life.<br>  But not alone.  She whom his heart has won,<br>  With loving aid, shall ever at his side<br>  (Till death them part) sustain him in his thought.<br>  And these two, nobly mated, each to each<br>  The sweet and ripe completion, shall be named<br>  With loyal love and tenderest respect<br>  By knight and lady, poet, sage and priest,<br>  In mart and camp, in palace and in cot,<br>  By babbling gray-beard and by lisping child,<br>  Wherever Britain's banner is unfurled.<br>  So shall the land grow strong with bonds of peace,<br>  Till men believe that wars have ceased to drench<br>  The earth with bloody rain;--and Art shall smile<br>  On myriad shapes of beauty and of use,--<br>  And Wisdom shall have freer scope, and push<br>  The boulders of old folly from her field,--<br>  And men shall walk with larger minds across<br>  The limits of the superstitious past,<br>  And cull the gold out of the dross of things,<br>  Flinging the dross aside,--and then shall be<br>  New hopes of better changes yet to be,<br>  When harmony shall reign through all the world,<br>  And interchange of good for common weal<br>  Be only law.<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A palace shall arise<br>  Beneath the guidance of the Blameless Prince,<br>  The crystal image of his ample mind,<br>  The home of what is best in every clime;<br>  And thither, from all lands beneath the sun,<br>  Shall crowd the patient workers in all arts,<br>  Bringing the treasures of their skill. The hands<br>  Of many nations with a brother's clasp<br>  Shall join together; and the Babel tongues<br>  Of Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern lands<br>  Shall strive no more in discord, but, as one,<br>  Shall make harmonious music, as of yore<br>  The sound of four great rivers rose and fell<br>  Through fragrant splendours in the Eden-world.<br>  <br>  And men shall say:  'Now is the reign of peace,<br>  Foretold by sacred sages, come at last.<br>  And cries of war shall never more be heard<br>  Through the fair world, but men shall take their swords<br>  And beat them into ploughshares, and their spears<br>  And lances they shall turn to pruning-hooks,--<br>  Nation with nation shall contend no more,<br>  Save as to who may reach the goal of best<br>  Before the other, for the common good,--<br>  And men shall only vie in virtue, skill<br>  And beauty, fruits of hand and head and heart,--<br>  And strength shall be in knowledge and its use,--<br>  And right, not might, shall guide men in their acts,--<br>  And small and great shall have one common law,--<br>  And he, alone, shall be considered just<br>  Who, in a doubtful matter, puts himself<br>  In his friend's place.  So all men shall be friends:<br>  For each shall see in other but himself,<br>  And love him as himself.  This is Christ's rule,<br>  Which the base world so long has set at nought,<br>  But now restored by our All-blameless Prince,<br>  And preached by gentle act to all the world.'<br>  <br>  So shall men say, rejoicing; but, alas!<br>  While yet the words rise from their gladdened hearts,<br>  The olive garland shall begin to fade<br>  On the sweet brows of peace; and Avarice,<br>  Like a gaunt wolf, ever unsatisfied<br>  As long as one lamb bleats within the fold,<br>  Shall raise the harsh cry that awakens war.<br>  <br>  In those far lands beyond the Southern Sea,<br>  Traversed by knights who seek the Holy Grail,<br>  The mountains belch forth fire, and flood the slopes<br>  And valleys with the sulphurous tide of hell,<br>  Till man and all his works are whelmed beneath.<br>  Then, wearied with his rage, the demon sleeps,<br>  And o'er the frozen graves of the long dead<br>  The hopeful vine grows and the flowers bloom,<br>  And children's voices and the song of birds<br>  Bid hush the awful memory of the past.<br>  But on some doomful night an ominous roar<br>  Startles the dreaming villager, who, looking<br>  Forth through his shivering casement, sees the sky<br>  Alive with fearful forms.  The spirits of fire,<br>  Unchained from their long bondage, with fierce joy<br>  Dance onward, bearing death, while smoky palls<br>  Waver around them.  With their ghostly hands<br>  From wrathful vials they pour blazing streams<br>  That lick the earth, from which is no escape<br>  But death--and death comes soon.  So after peace,<br>  Which men had thought eternal, shall come war,<br>  And chase, with rumbling horror, the sweet dreams<br>  Of gentle harmony throughout the world.<br>  <br>  Then shall the spirit of the Table Round<br>  Enter men's hearts and make their right arms strong<br>  For deeds of war,--deeds that shall make the eyes<br>  Of those who come thereafter flash with pride.<br>  <br>  By many a far-off height and river-side<br>  Shall fall such men as fought at Badon-hill<br>  Warring with heathen foes; and lonely hearths<br>  Shall sorrow for the dead who come no more.<br>  And, one war over, others shall succeed,<br>  And others; and the blaze of burning towns<br>  Shall blot the moon out of the midnight sky.<br>  <br>  And some will say: 'Now is the end at hand<br>  Of all things, and the whole fair world is doomed<br>  To sink in ashy nothingness.  The wrath<br>  Of God is kindled for the sins of men.'<br>  <br>  But when the fiery wave of war has washed<br>  The world, as gold from which the dross is burned,<br>  The nations shall rise purer, and men's hearts<br>  Shall fear the touch of wrong; the slave ashamed<br>  And angry once to see the pitiless sun<br>  Smile on his chains, shall leap and sing for joy.<br>  Free thought shall take the ancient shield of Truth<br>  And make it bright, showing the Artist's work,<br>  Long hid by stains and rust from longing eyes;<br>  And hoary ills shall die, and o'er their graves<br>  Shall bloom fair flowers, and trees of goodly fruit<br>  To gladden and make strong the heart of man."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said Sir Bedivere:  "O, good and wise,<br>  My heart is full of wonder, and I doubt<br>  Whether or not I listen in a dream<br>  Wrought by thy wizard spells around my soul.<br>  But tell me further of the Blameless Prince,<br>  The image of King Arthur,--or himself,<br>  Albeit thou sayst it not, come back again<br>  From his long sleep in Avalon.  Shall he die,<br>  Or shall he live and teach men how to live<br>  Until the coming of our Master, Christ?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Merlin, with a cloud upon his face,<br>  As thinking of the sorrow that must be,<br>  Yet with a silver smile about the cloud,<br>  Answered Sir Bedivere:  "O, loving well<br>  And loyal to the last, the Blameless Prince,<br>  The God-sent promise of a better time<br>  When all men shall be like him, good and wise,<br>  Shall, when his work is finished, pass away;<br>  And the dark shade of sorrow's wings shall blot<br>  The sky, and all the widowed land shall mourn;<br>  And chiefly she, his other self, the Queen, <br>  Shall weep long years in lonely palace-halls,<br>  Missing the music of a silent voice.<br>  But, though his voice be silent, in men's hearts<br>  Shall sink the fruitful memory of his life,<br>  And take deep root, and grow to glorious deeds.<br>  And she will write the story of his life<br>  Who loved him, and though tears may blot the page,<br>  Even as they fall, the rainbow hues of hope<br>  Shall bless them with Christ's promise of the time<br>  When they that sow in tears shall reap in joy."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, sad and sore amazed, Sir Bedivere:<br>  "O, Merlin, Merlin, truly didst thou say<br>  That hid from eyes of common men like me<br>  Is that which is to be in after days;<br>  For even now I scarce can comprehend<br>  What thou hast spoken with prophetic lips.<br>  These things are very far beyond my reach.<br>  This only do I know, that I am now<br>  An orphan knight, reft of the royal sire<br>  That made me knight, giving my soul new birth<br>  And heirdom to the Christian fellowship<br>  Of the Round Table.  Gladly would I give<br>  All glory ever won by knightly deed,<br>  All honour in the ranks of my compeers,<br>  All gentle blandishments of ladies fair,<br>  All that I am, or have, or prize the most,<br>  And sink into the meanness of the churl<br>  That feeds the Saxon's swine, for but one glimpse<br>  Of my loved lord, King Arthur.  But I know<br>  That he will never more to Camelot<br>  Bring back the glory of his vanished face,<br>  Nor call me his 'true knight, Sir Bedivere.'<br>  So I will pray, even as thou badst me pray,<br>  And as King Arthur bade me, for his soul,<br>  That to his far-off home no sigh may come,<br>  From this his orphan and unhappy realm,<br>  To mar the melody of Avalon.<br>  And though he may not hither come to me,<br>  May I not hope that I may go to him,<br>  And see him face to face, in that fair land,<br>  Whose beauty mortal eye has never seen,<br>  Whose music mortal ear has never heard,<br>  Whose glory mortal heart has not conceived.<br>  <br>  But, Merlin, I would ask thee one thing more,<br>  If thou have patience with my blunter sense<br>  (For I am but a knight, and thou, a sage,<br>  And knowest all things)--prithee, tell me, Merlin,<br>  If, in the far-off after-time, shall come<br>  A Prince who shall be known by Arthur's name,<br>  And bear it blamelessly as he did his."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Merlin, with a wise smile on his face,<br>  Such as a mother wears who gently tries <br>  To answer the hard question of her child,<br>  Answered Sir Bedivere:  "Thou askest well,<br>  And fain am I to answer.  That good Prince<br>  Of whom I spake -- Albert, the Blameless Prince--<br>  Shall be the head of many dynasties.<br>  His blood, in after years, shall wear the crown<br>  Of many kingdoms.  She who loved him well<br>  Shall reign for many years when he is gone,<br>  And round her widowed diadem shall gleam<br>  The richer halo of a nation's love,<br>  For her own sake and for the sainted dead.<br>  And she will shed the brightness of her soul<br>  On Britain's future Kings, and they shall learn,<br>  Not only from her lips, but from her life,<br>  That who rules well must make Christ's law his rule.<br>  And of the Good Queen and the Blameless Prince<br>  One son shall be named Arthur.  Like the King<br>  For whom thy heart is sad, Sir Bedivere,<br>  He shall be true, and brave, and generous<br>  In speech and act to all of all degrees,<br>  And win the unsought guerdon of men's love.<br>  <br>  In a far land beneath the setting sun,<br>  Now and long hence undreamed of (save by me<br>  Who, in my soul's eyes, see the great round world<br>  Whirled by the lightning touches of the sun<br>  Through time and space),--a land of stately woods,<br>  Of swift broad rivers, and of ocean lakes,--<br>  The name of Arthur,--him that is to be,--<br>  (Son of the Good Queen and the Blameless Prince),<br>  Shall shed new glories upon him we loved."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, by the memories of his lord, the King,<br>  Sir Bedivere was quickened into tears,<br>  But, like a boy ashamed to shew wet eyes<br>  Before a boy, he passed his mail&eacute;d hand<br>  Athwart his face, and frightened back his grief.<br>  And seeing Merlin made no sign to speak<br>  More of the Arthur of the after-time,<br>  He took the word:  'Thanks, Merlin, thou art kind<br>  Beyond the limit of my gratitude,<br>  I fear me.  Sorrow is a selfish thing,<br>  And much exacts from friendship.  Still, I thank thee<br>  That thou hast not gainsayed my utmost quest.<br>  And, now, I pray God bless him when he comes,<br>  That other Arthur.  May he keep his name<br>  As pure as his who ruled in Camelot;<br>  May he, in every wise, be like to him,<br>  Save in the pain that comes of love deceived<br>  And trampled faith; and may his far-off land<br>  Be great by noble deeds of noble men."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came a sound of music from the Lake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the soft sighing of the summer winds<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the pine-trees, and Sir Bedivere<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned toward the sound.  But as he turned again<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask of Merlin what the music meant,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merlin was gone, and he was all alone--<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone upon the beach amid the dead!<br>
