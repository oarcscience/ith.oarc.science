# WITCHES AT THE CROSS

THOUGH the witches used to be pretty lively in other places, they were
fond of climbing up and down the cross that stands by the road to Malá
Čermá (near Slaný). Joe Hilma heard tell of this, so he took his horse
and off he rode to see. He took with him a piece of chalk which had been
blessed, and made a circle with it. Then he went into the circle and
waited till midnight. Then, sure enough, he saw the witches, a great
swarm of them, climbing up and down the cross. They didn't see him while
this was going on, but when he rode out of the circle, off went the
witches after him. He galloped home at full speed. When he rode into the
yard they were close on his heels. They couldn't go any farther, for
they had no power to do it. I don't know how it happened, but one of
them flung a burning broom after him. The broom hit the door, and the
door was burned. Joe had quite enough of seeing the witches.
