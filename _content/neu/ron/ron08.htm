<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FIRST ACT</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">The hall of the Gibichungs on the Rhine. This is quite open at the back. A open shore stretching to the river occupies the background. Rocky heights enclose the shore. Gunther and Gutrune on a throne at one side, before which stands a table with drinking vessels on it. In front of this Hagen is seated</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Give ear, Hagen;<BR>
Tell me the truth:<BR>
Is my fame on the Rhine<BR>
Worthy of Gibich's son?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>I envy thee<BR>
Thy fame and thy glory;<BR>
Thy great renown was foretold<BR>
To me by Grimhild' our mother.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>I envy thee,<BR>
So envy not me.<BR>
1, as first-born, rule,<BR>
But the wisdom is thine.<BR>
Half-brother's feud<BR>
Could scarce be laid better;<BR>
Asking thus of my renown,<BR>
'Tis thy wisdom that I praise.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>My words I withdraw,<BR>
Thy fame might be more:<BR>
I know of precious treasures<BR>
That the Gibichung has not yet won.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Hide these, and I<BR>
Withdraw my praise.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>In summer's full-ripened glory<BR>
Blooms the Gibich stock,<BR>
Thou, Gunther, still unwived,<BR>
Thou, Gutrun', still unwed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Whom wouldst thou have me woo,<BR>
To win more wide renown?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>One I know of,<BR>
None nobler in the world.<BR>
She dwells on soaring rocks,<BR>
Her chamber is circled by fire;<BR>
And he who would Br&uuml;nnhild' woo<BR>
Must break through the daunting flame.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Suffices my strength for the task?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>For one stronger still it is decreed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Who is that hero unmatched?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Siegfried, the W&auml;lsung's son;<BR>
He is the hero bold.<BR>
A twin-born pair,<BR>
Whom fate turned to lovers,<BR>
Siegmund and Sieglinde,<BR>
Had as their offspring this child.<BR>
In the woods he grew and waxed strong.<BR>
'Tis he that Gutrun' must wed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>[<I>Shyly</I>.]</P>
<P>Tell me what deed of high valour<BR>
Made this hero the first in renown.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>At Neidh&ouml;hle<BR>
A huge dragon lay,<BR>
Who guarded the Nibelung's gold.<BR>
He was slain,<BR>
And his horrid jaws closed<BR>
By Siegfried's invincible sword.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A></P>
<P>From this colossal deed<BR>
The fame of the hero dawned.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Thoughtfully</I>.]</P>
<P>They say that a priceless treasure<BR>
The Niblungs had in their hoard.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>The man who could use its spell<BR>
Were lord of the world evermore.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>And Siegfried won it in fight?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>He has the Niblungs in thrall.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>And Br&uuml;nnhild' no other can win?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>To no other will the flames yield.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Rises angrily from his seat</I>.]</P>
<P>Why wake dissension and doubt?<BR>
Why stir up my desire<BR>
And yearning for joys<BR>
That cannot be won?</P>
<P>[<I>He walks to and fro much agitated</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Without leaving his seat causes Gunther to pull up as he approaches him, by a gesture of mysterious import</I>.]</P>
<P>Would not Br&uuml;nnhilde<BR>
Be thy bride,<BR>
Were she by Siegfried brought home?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Turns away doubtful and angry</I>.]</P>
<P>But how could I force this man<BR>
To woo the bride for me?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>As before</I>.]</P>
<P>Thy simple prayer would force him,<BR>
Gutrun' winning him first.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Thou mockest, cruel Hagen!<BR>
What arts have I to bind him?<BR>
The greatest hero<BR>
In all the world<BR>
Has long ere this by the fairest<BR>
Women on earth been loved.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Bending confidentially towards Gutrune</I>.]</P>
<P>What of the drink in the chest?</P>
<P>[<I>More secretly</I>.]</P>
<P>In me who won it have more faith.<BR>
To thee in love it will bind<BR>
Him whom thy heart most desires.</P>
<P>[<I>Gunther has come to the table again, and, leaning against it, pays close attention</I>.]</P>
<P>Hither did Siegfried come,<BR>
And taste of this potion of herbs,<BR>
He would straight forget he had looked<BR>
On any woman before,<BR>
Or been by woman approached.<BR>
Now answer:<BR>
Think ye my counsel good?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Starting up suddenly</I>.]</P>
<P>Now Grimhild' be praised,<BR>
Who for brother gave us thee.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Siegfried fain I would behold!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>But how can he be found?</P>
<P>[<I>A horn on the stage, from the background on the left, very loud but distant</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Listens and turns to Gunther</I>.]</P>
<P>Merrily hunting<BR>
After renown<BR>
Across the world<BR>
As through a wood,<BR>
Belike in his chase he will come<BR>
To the Gibich's realm on the Rhine.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Heartily welcome were he.</P>
<P>[<I>A horn on the stage, nearer, but still distant. Both listen</I>.]</P>
<P>A horn from the Rhine I hear.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Looks down the river and calls towards the back</I>.]</P>
<P>A man and horse on board a boat<BR>
His horn how gaily he winds!</P>
<P>[<I>A horn on the stage sounds nearer. Gunther stops halfway listening</I>.]</P>
<P>See the leisurely stroke,<BR>
And the indolent arm<BR>
Against the stream<BR>
Urging the boat!<BR>
So skilful a hand<BR>
On the swinging oar<BR>
Can be but his<BR>
Who the dragon slew:--<BR>
It is Siegfried-surely no other!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Will he go by?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Making a trumpet of his hands, calls towards the river</I>.]</P>
<P>Hoiho! Blithe hero,<BR>
Whither bound?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>From the distance</I>.]</P>
<P>I seek the son of Gibich.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>I bid thee welcome to Gunther's hall.</P>
<P>[<I>Siegfried in a boat appears at the shore</I>.]</P>
<P>This way! Stop here and land!</P>
<P>[<I>Siegfried brings his boat to the shore. Hagen makes it fast with the chain. Siegfried springs ashore with his horse. Gunther has come down and joined Hagen</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Hail, Siegfried, hero bold!</P>
<P>[<I>Gutrune gazes at Siegfried from the throne in astonishment. Gunther prepares to offer him friendly greetings. All stand fixed in silent mutual contemplation</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Who is Gibich's son?</P>
<P>[<I>Leaning on his horse, remains quietly standing by the boat</I>.]</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>I am he thou dost seek.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Thy fame has reached me<BR>
From the Rhine;<BR>
Now fight with me,<BR>
Or be my friend.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Be thou mine;<BR>
Thou art welcome!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Where stable my horse?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Leave him to me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Turning to Hagen</I>.]</P>
<P>My name thou knowest;<BR>
Where have we met?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>I guessed from thy strength<BR>
Who thou must be.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>As he hands over the horse to Hagen</I>.]</P>
<P>Be careful of Grane,<BR>
For thou hast never<BR>
Led by the rein<BR>
So noble a steed.</P>
<P>[<I>Hagen leads the horse away. While Siegfried looks thoughtfully after him, Gutrune, obeying a sign of Hagen's which Siegfried does not notice, goes to her room through a door on the left. Gunther comes into the hall with Siegfried, whom he has invited to accompany him</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>My father's ancient hall,<BR>
O hero, greet in gladness!<BR>
All thou beholdest,<BR>
Where'er thou art,<BR>
Treat as thine own henceforward<BR>
Thine is my kingdom--<BR>
Land and folk;<BR>
By my body I swear it!<BR>
Yea, myself I am thine.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Nor land nor folk have I to give,<BR>
Nor father's house nor hall;<BR>
In my body<BR>
Is all my wealth;<BR>
As I live it grows less.<BR>
But a sword have I<BR>
Which I welded;<BR>
Let my sword be my witness!--<BR>
That and myself I bestow.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Who has come back and now stands behind Siegfried</I>.]</P>
<P>Of the Nibelungs' treasure<BR>
Rumour names thee the lord.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Turning round to Hagen</I>.]</P>
<P>I almost forgot the hoard,<BR>
So lightly I prize its worth.<BR>
I left it lying in a cavern,<BR>
Where a dragon once held watch.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>And nothing took at all?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Only this, not knowing its use.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>It is the Tarnhelm,<BR>
The gem of the Nibelung's art;<BR>
Its use, when worn on thy head,<BR>
Is to change thy shape as thou wilt;<BR>
If fain to be borne afar,<BR>
In a flash lo! thou art there!<BR>
Didst thou take nothing besides?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Yes, a ring.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Which safe thou dost hold?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Tenderly</I>.]</P>
<P>'Tis held by a woman fair.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Aside</I>.]</P>
<P>Br&uuml;nnhild'!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Nay, Siegfried, let us not barter;<BR>
All I have a bauble poor,<BR>
Matched with thy treasure, would be.<BR>
I will serve thee without reward.</P>
<P>[<I>Hagen has gone to Gutrune's door, and now opens it</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>[<I>Enters carrying a full drinking horn, with which she approaches Siegfried</I>.]</P>
<P>Welcome, O guest,<BR>
To Gibich's house!<BR>
'Tis his daughter gives thee to drink.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Bows in a friendly manner and takes the horn, which he holds thoughtfully before him</I>.]</P>
<P>Were all forgot<BR>
Thou gavest to me,<BR>
One lesson<BR>
I will never forget;<BR>
So this first draught<BR>
With love undying,<BR>
Br&uuml;nnhild', I drink to thee!</P>
<P>[<I>He puts the drinking-horn to his lips and takes a long draught; then he hands it back to Gutrune, who, ashamed and confused, casts down her eyes. Siegfried gazes at her with sudden passion</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>O thou who dost scorch<BR>
And blind with thine eyes,<BR>
Why sink them abashed by my gaze?</P>
<P>[<I>Gutrune, blushing, looks up at him</I>.]</P>
<P>O lovely maid,<BR>
Lower thine eyes;<BR>
My heart is aflame,<BR>
Burnt by their light;<BR>
They kindle my blood; it flows<BR>
In devouring torrents of fire.</P>
<P>[<I>With a trembling voice</I>.]</P>
<P>Gunther, what name is thy sister's?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Gutrune.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Softly</I>.]</P>
<P>Can those be good runes<BR>
That in her eyes I am reading?</P>
<P>[<I>He ardently seizes Gutrune's hand</I>.]</P>
<P>With thy brother I was fain to serve;<BR>
His pride my prayer scorned.<BR>
Were I to pray the same of thee,<BR>
Wouldst thou like him be proud?</P>
<P>[<I>Gutrune, involuntarily meets Hagen's eye. She bows her head humbly, and, expecting her feeling of unworthiness with a gesture, leaves the hall with faltering steps</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Attentively watched by Hagen and Gunther, gazes after Gutrune as if entranced</I>.]</P>
<P>Gunther, hast thou a wife?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>I am not wed,<BR>
Nor, it would seem,<BR>
Likely to find a wife!<BR>
My heart on one I have set<BR>
Whom there is no way to win.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Turns with animation to Gunther</I>.]</P>
<P>In what canst thou fail<BR>
With me for friend?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>On rocky heights her home;<BR>
Surrounded by fire her hall;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Interrupting in wondering haste</I>.]</P>
<P>"On rocky heights her home<BR>
Surrounded by fire her hall" . . .?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>He only who braves the fire . . .</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>"He only who braves the fire" . . . ?</P>
<P>[<I>As if making an intense effort to remember something</I>.]</P>
<P><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>May Br&uuml;nnhilde's wooer be.</P>
<P>[<I>Siegfried shows by a gesture that at the mention of Br&uuml;nnhilde's name all remembrance of her has faded</I>.]</P>
<P>I dare not essay the dread mountain<BR>
The flames would not fall for me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Awakens from his dreamy state, and turns to Gunther high spirited and gay</I>.]</P>
<P>For thee I will win her,<BR>
Of fire I have no fear;<BR>
For thy man am I,<BR>
And my strength is thine,<BR>
If Gutrun' I win as my wife.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Gutrune gladly I grant thee</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Thou shalt have Br&uuml;nnhilde then.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>But how wilt deceive her?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>I will wear the Tarnhelm,<BR>
And appear in thy form.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Then let the oath now be sworn!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Blood-brotherhood<BR>
Sworn be by oath!</P>
<P>[<I>Hagen fills a drinking-horn with fresh wine; he holds it out to Siegfried and Gunther, who cut their arms with their swords and hold them for a short pace over the horn; then they each lay two fingers on the horn, which Hagen continues to hold between them</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried and Gunther</P>
<P>Quickening blood<BR>
Of blossoming life<BR>
Lo! I drop in the horn!<BR>
Bravely mixed<BR>
In brotherly love,</P>

<P>Bloom our blood in the draught!<BR>
Troth I drink to the friend<BR>
Glad and free<BR>
To-day from the bond<BR>
Blood-brotherhood spring!<BR>
But if broken the bond,<BR>
Or if faithless the friend,<BR>
What in drops to-day<BR>
We drink kindly<BR>
In torrents wildly shall flow,<BR>
Paying treachery's wage.<BR>
So--sealed be the bond!<BR>
So--pledged be my faith!</P>
<P>[<I>Gunther drinks and hands the horn to Siegfried, who finishes the draught, and holds out the empty horn to Hagen. Hagen breaks the horn in two with his sword. Gunther and Siegfried join hands</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Observes Hagen, who, while the oath was being sworn, has stood behind him</I>.]</P>
<P>Why hast not thou plighted thy troth?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>My blood had soured the good draught.<BR>
It flows not pure<BR>
And noble like yours;<BR>
Stubborn and cold,<BR>
Slow it runs,<BR>
My cheek refusing to redden.<BR>
I hold aloof<BR>
From hot-blooded bonds.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>To Siegfried</I>.]</P>
<P>Heed not him and his spleen.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Puts on his shield again</I>.]</P>
<P>Up, then, and off!<BR>
Back to the boat!<BR>
Sail swift to the mountain!</P>
<P>[<I>He steps nearer to Gunther and points at him</I>.]</P>
<P><A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></P>
<P>By the bank one night<BR>
On board thou shalt tarry,<BR>
And then bring home the bride.</P>
<P>[<I>He turns to go, and beckons Gunther to follow him</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Wilt thou not rest awhile?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>I am eager to be back.</P>
<P>[<I>He goes to the shore to unmoor the boat</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Thou, Hagen, keep guard o'er the homestead.</P>
<P>[<I>He follows Siegfried to the shore. Whilst Siegfried and Gunther, after laying their arms in the boat, are hoisting the sail and making ready for departure, Hagen takes up his spear and shield. Gutrune appears at the door of her chamber just as Siegfried is pushing of the boat, which immediately glides into the middle of the stream</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>So swiftly whither haste they?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>To woo Br&uuml;nnhild' for bride.</P>
<P>[<I>While he seats himself comfortably with shield and spear in front of the hall</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Siegfried?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>See how he hastes,<BR>
For wife seeking to win thee!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Siegfried--mine?</P>
<P>[<I>She returns to her room greatly excited. Siegfried has seized an oar and rows the boat down-stream, so that it is soon lost to view</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Sits motionless, his back against the door-post of the hall</I>.]</P>
<P>On guard here I sit<BR>
Watching the house,<BR>
Warding the hall from the foe;<BR>
Gibich's son</P>
<P><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></P>
<P>Is sped by the wind,<BR>
And sails away for a wife;<BR>
A hero bold<BR>
Of the helm has charge,<BR>
And danger braves for his sake;<BR>
His bride once loved<BR>
He brings to the Rhine;<BR>
With her he brings me--the ring.<BR>
O merry comrades,<BR>
Freeborn and honoured,<BR>
Gaily speed on in your pride!<BR>
Base though ye deem him,<BR>
The Niblung's son<BR>
Shall yet be your lord.</P>
<P>[<I>A curtain which frames the front of the hall is drawn, and cuts the stage off from the audience</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_drgnsep"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/drgnsep.jpg"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">The curtain is raised again. The rocky height as in the Prelude. Br&uuml;nnhilde<BR>
sits at the entrance to the cave in silent contemplation of Siegfried's<BR>
ring. Moved by blissful memories, she covers the ring with kisses.<BR>
Distant thunder is heard; she looks up and listens. She turns to<BR>
the ring again. A flash of lightning. Again she listens, and looks<BR>
into the distance, whence a dark thundercloud is approaching the rock</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>On my ear from afar<BR>
Falls an old sound familiar.<BR>
A horse comes flying<BR>
Swift through the air;<BR>
On the clouds it sweeps<BR>
In storm to the rock.<BR>
Who seeks the lonely one here?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute's voice</P>
<P>[<I>From the distance</I>.]</P>
<P>Br&uuml;nnhilde, sister,<BR>
Wake if thou sleepest!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Starts from her seat</I>.]</P>
<P>Waltraute's call!<BR>
How welcome the sound!</P>
<P>[<I>Calling to the wing, and then hastening to the edge of the rock</I>.]</P>
<P>Dost thou, sister,<BR>
Boldly swinging come this way?<BR>
In the wood--<BR>
Still dear to thee--<BR>
Halt and dismount,<BR>
And leave thy courser to rest.</P>
<P>[<I>She runs into the wood, from which a loud sound like a thunder-clap is heard. She returns in great agitation with Waltraute, and remains joyfully excited without noticing the latter's anxious fear</I>.]</P>
<P>Art thou so bold<BR>
That thou art come<BR>
Br&uuml;nnhild' to greet,<BR>
Thy love unconquered by dread?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>Thou alone<BR>
Art cause of my haste!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>For Br&uuml;nnhild's sake Warfather's ban<BR>
Hast thou thus bravely broken?<BR>
Or perchance--O say!--</P>
<P>[<I>With some hesitation</I>.]</P>
<P>Has he at last<BR>
Softened to his child?<BR>
When against the God<BR>
I sought to shield Siegmund,<BR>
Vainly--I know it--<BR>
My deed fulfilled his desire.<BR>
And I know that his anger<BR>
Was assuaged,<BR>
For albeit in slumber deep<BR>
Here to the rock I was bound,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></P>
<P>Doomed to be thrall to the man<BR>
Who should wake the maid as he passed,<BR>
To my anguished prayer<BR>
He granted grace;<BR>
With ravening fire<BR>
He surrounded the rock,<BR>
To bar to all cowards the road.<BR>
Bane and chastisement<BR>
Turned so to blessing;<BR>
A hero unmatched<BR>
Has won me as wife;<BR>
Blest by his love,<BR>
In light and laughter I live.</P>
<P>[<I>She embraces Waltraute with wild manifestations of joy, which the latter tries with anxious impatience to repress</I>.]</P>
<P>Hast thou been lured by my lot,<BR>
And wouldst thou, sister,<BR>
Feast on my gladness,<BR>
Sharing in my delight?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>[<I>Vehemently</I>.]</P>
<P>Sharing the frenzy<BR>
That has maddened thee, fool!<BR>
Far other the cause why I come,<BR>
Defying Wotan in fear.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Here, for the first time, notices with surprise Waltraute's wildly excited state</I>.]</P>
<P>Art afraid?<BR>
Anguished with terror?<BR>
So the stern one does not forgive?<BR>
Thou fearest his punishing wrath?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>[<I>Gloomily</I>.]</P>
<P>Might I but fear it,<BR>
At an end were my distress.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>I am perplexed and amazed.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>Calm thou thy frenzy;<BR>
Mark with care what I say!<BR>
The fear that drove me<BR>
Hither to thee<BR>
Drives me back to Walhall again.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Alarmed</I>.]</P>
<P>What ails, then, the Gods everlasting?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>Give earnest heed to what I tell thee!<BR>
Since from thee Wotan parted,<BR>
No more has he sent<BR>
Us to battle;<BR>
Anxious and bewildered<BR>
We rode to the field.<BR>
Shunned are Walhall's bold heroes<BR>
By Warfather;<BR>
Riding alone,<BR>
Without pause or rest<BR>
He wandered and roamed through the world.<BR>
At last he returned<BR>
With his spear splintered;<BR>
In his hand the pieces;<BR>
A hero had cleft it asunder.<BR>
With silent sign<BR>
Walhall's heroes<BR>
Then he sent forth<BR>
To hew down the world-ash-tree.<BR>
He bade them pile<BR>
The logs as they hewed them,<BR>
Until they were heaped<BR>
High round the hall of the blest.<BR>
The Gods he next<BR>
Called to a council;<BR>
The high seat<BR>
He solemnly took,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></P>
<P>Bidding them<BR>
Who gathered in fear sit beside him.<BR>
The heroes filled<BR>
The hall, ranged round in their order.<BR>
So sits he,<BR>
Speaks no word,<BR>
Upon his high seat<BR>
Grave and mute,<BR>
The splintered spear<BR>
Held fast in his hand,<BR>
Holda's apples<BR>
Touching no more.<BR>
Fear and amazement<BR>
Hold the Gods fast fettered.<BR>
He has sent his ravens<BR>
Forth to seek tidings;<BR>
If they return<BR>
And bring him comforting news,<BR>
Then the God will<BR>
With soul serene<BR>
Smile evermore and be glad.<BR>
Round his knees in sorrow<BR>
Twined lie the Valkyries;<BR>
He heeds not<BR>
Our glances beseeching;<BR>
By terror and wild anguish<BR>
We all are consumed.<BR>
Against his breast<BR>
Weeping I nestled,<BR>
Then soft grew his gaze:<BR>
He remembered, Br&uuml;nnhilde, thee.<BR>
He closed his eyes<BR>
As if dreaming,<BR>
Heavily sighed<BR>
And whispered these words:<BR>
"If to the deep Rhine's daughters</P>
<P><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></P>
<P>She would restore the ring that was theirs,<BR>
From the grievous curse<BR>
Both God and world were freed!"<BR>
Then I took thought,<BR>
And from his side<BR>
Through the silent ranks<BR>
Stole noiselessly forth.<BR>
In haste, unseen,<BR>
I mounted my horse,<BR>
And stormed in tumult to thee.<BR>
Grant, O sister,<BR>
The boon I beg<BR>
What thou canst do,<BR>
Undaunted perform!<BR>
End thou the grief of the Gods!</P>
<P>[<I>She has thrown herself down before Br&uuml;nnhilde</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Quietly</I>.]</P>
<P>What dreadful dream-born fancies,<BR>
Sad one, are those thou dost tell?<BR>
The high Gods' holy<BR>
And cloud-paved heaven<BR>
Is no longer my home.<BR>
I grasp not what thou art saying;<BR>
Dark its sense,<BR>
Wild and confused.<BR>
Within thine eyes,<BR>
So over-weary,<BR>
Gleams wavering fire;<BR>
With thy wan visage,<BR>
O pale-faced sister,<BR>
What wouldst thou, wild one, of me?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>[<I>Vehemently</I>.]</P>
<P>The ring upon thy hand--<BR>
'Tis that: ah, be implored!<BR>
For Wotan fling it away!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>The ring--away?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>To the Rhine-daughters give it again.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>The Rhine-daughters--I--the ring?<BR>
Siegfried's love-pledge?<BR>
Hast thou gone crazy?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>Hear me! Hear my despair!<BR>
On this hangs<BR>
The world's undoing and woe.<BR>
Throw it from thee<BR>
Into the water;<BR>
End the anguish of Walhall;<BR>
The accurst thing cast in the waves!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Ha! dost thou know what 'twould mean?<BR>
How shouldst thou,<BR>
Maid unloving and cold!<BR>
Much is Walhall's rapture,<BR>
Much is the fame of the Gods;<BR>
More is my ring.<BR>
One glance at its shining gold,<BR>
One flash of its sacred fire<BR>
Is more precious<BR>
Than bliss of all the Gods<BR>
Enduring for aye!<BR>
For Siegfried's dear love<BR>
Shines from it bright and blessed.<BR>
Love of Siegfried!<BR>
Ah, could I but utter the rapture<BR>
Bound up in the ring!</P>
<P>Go back to the holy<BR>
Council of Gods;<BR>
Repeat what I have told thee<BR>
Of my ring:<BR>
That love I will not forswear,<BR>
Of love they never shall rob me;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A></P>
<P>Sooner shall Walhall's glory<BR>
Perish and pass!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>This is thy faith, then?<BR>
To her sorrow<BR>
Thus coldly thou leavest thy sister?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Up and away!<BR>
Swiftly to horse!<BR>
I will not part with the ring.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Waltraute</P>
<P>Woe's me! Woe's me!<BR>
Woe to thee, sister!<BR>
Woe to Walhall's Gods!</P>
<P>[<I>She rushes away. A storm-cloud immediately rises from the wood, accompanied by thunder</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>As she looks after the brightly lit, retreating thunder-cloud, which soon vanishes in the distance</I>.]</P>
<P>Borne by the wind<BR>
In storm and lightning,<BR>
Haste away, cloud,<BR>
And may I see thee no more!</P>
<P>[<I>Twilight has fallen. The light of the fire gradually shines more brightly from below. She gazes quietly out on the landscape</I>.]</P>
<P>Eventide shadows<BR>
Dim the heavens,<BR>
And more brightly<BR>
The flames that encircle me glow.</P>
<P>[<I>The firelight approaches from below. Ever-brightening tongues of flame shoot up over the edge of the rock</I>.]</P>
<P>Why leap so wildly<BR>
The billows that blaze round the rock?<BR>
Up here to the peak<BR>
Surges the fiery flood!</P>
<P>[<I>Siegfried's horn is heard from the valley. Br&uuml;nnhilde starts up in delight</I>.]</P>
<P>Siegfried?<BR>
Siegfried returned?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A></P>
<P>With his horn greeting he sends!<BR>
Up! Out to the welcome!<BR>
Swift to my God's embrace!</P>
<P>[<I>She hastens joyfully to the edge of the crag. Flames leap up, out of which Siegfried springs forward on to a high rock, whereupon the flames immediately withdraw and again only shine up from below. Br&uuml;nnhilde recoils in terror, flies to the foreground, and from there, in speechless astonishment, stares at Siegfried, who, wearing the Tarnhelm, which covers the upper half of his face, leaving only his eyes free, appears in Gunther's form</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Betrayed! Who seeks me here?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Remaining on the rock at the back, motionless and leaning on his shield, regards Br&uuml;nnhilde. In a feigned (harsher) voice</I>.]</P>
<P>Br&uuml;nnhild'! A wooer comes<BR>
Whom thy fire did not dismay.<BR>
I want thee for my wife;<BR>
Consent to follow me!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Trembling violently</I>.]</P>
<P>What man has done<BR>
This deed undaunted<BR>
That the boldest only dares?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>As before</I>.]</P>
<P>A hero who will tame<BR>
Thy pride by force at need.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>A monster stands<BR>
Upon yonder stone;<BR>
An eagle has come<BR>
To rend me in pieces!<BR>
Who art thou, frightful one?<BR>
Art thou a mortal,<BR>
Or dost thou hie<BR>
From Hella's dark host?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>As before, beginning with a slightly tremulous voice, but continuing with more confidence</I>.]</P>
<P>A Gibichung am I,<BR>
And Gunther is his name<BR>
Whom thou must follow hence.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Breaking out in despair</I>.]</P>
<P>Wotan! Thou cruel,<BR>
Merciless God!<BR>
Woe! Now I see<BR>
How thine anger works!<BR>
To scorn and sorrow<BR>
I am condemned.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Springs down from the stone and approaches</I>.]</P>
<P>Night falls apace;<BR>
Within thy cave<BR>
Thou must receive thy husband.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Stretching out with a threatening gesture the finger on which she wears Siegfried's ring</I>.]</P>
<P>Stand back! Fear thou this token!<BR>
While I am shielded by this,<BR>
Thou canst not force me to shame.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Wife it shall make thee to Gunther;<BR>
With this ring thou shalt be wed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Stand back, base robber!<BR>
Impious thief!<BR>
Nor dare, overbold, to draw near!<BR>
Stronger than steel<BR>
Made by the ring,<BR>
I never will yield!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>That it must be mine<BR>
I learn from thy lips.</P>
<P>[<I>He presses towards her, There is a struggle. Br&uuml;nnhilde wrenches herself free, flies and turns round as if to defend herself. Siegfried seizes her again. She flies; he reaches her. They wrestle violently together. Siegfried catches her hand and draws the ring from her finger. She gives a loud scream. As she sinks helpless into his arms her unconscious look meets Siegfried's eyes. Siegfried lays her fainting on the stone bench at the entrance to the cave</I>.]</P>
<P><A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Now thou art mine!<BR>
Br&uuml;nnhilde, Gunther's bride,<BR>
Lead me the way to thy cave!'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Stares, as if fainting, before her; exhausted</I>.]</P>
<P>O woman undone,<BR>
Where now thy defence?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Drives her on with a gesture of command. Trembling and with tottering steps she goes into the cave. In his natural voice</I>.]</P>
<P>Now, Nothung, witness thou<BR>
That chastely I have wooed,<BR>
And loyal been to my brother;<BR>
Lie betwixt me and his bride!</P>
<P>[<I>He follows Br&uuml;nnhilde. The curtain falls</I>.]</P>
