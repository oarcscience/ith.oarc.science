<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SECOND ACT</H1>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">A open space on the shore in front of the Gibichungs' hall; to the right the open entrance to the hall, to the left the bank of the Rhine. From the latter, crossing the stage and mounting towards the back, rises a rocky height, cut by several mountain-paths. There an altar-stone to Fricka is visible, as well as one, higher up, to Wotan, and one at the side to Donner. It is night. Hagen, his arm round his spear and his shield by his side, sits against one of the pillars of the hall asleep. The moon shines out suddenly and throws a vivid light on Hagen and his immediate surroundings. Alberich is seen crouching in front of him, leaning his arms on Hagen's knees</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Alberich</P>
<P>[<I>Softly</I>.]</P>
<P>Hagen, son, art asleep?<BR>
Betrayed by drowsiness<BR>
And rest thou dost not hear?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Softly, without moving, so that he seems to sleep on although his eyes are open</I>.]</P>
<P>I hear thee, O baleful Niblung;<BR>
What wouldst thou tell me while I slumber?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Alberich</P>
<P>Remember the might<BR>
Thou art endowed with,<BR>
If thou art valiant<BR>
As thy mother bore thee to me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Still as before</I>.]</P>
<P>Though courage she bestowed,<BR>
I have no cause to thank her<BR>
For falling under thy spell;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A></P>
<P>Soon old, wan and pale,<BR>
Hating the happy,<BR>
Where is my joy?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Alberich</P>
<P>[<I>As before</I>.]</P>
<P>Hagen, my son,<BR>
Hate thou the happy;<BR>
This joyless and<BR>
Sorrow-laden one,<BR>
Him alone thou shalt love.<BR>
Be thou strong<BR>
And bold and wise!<BR>
Those whom with weapons<BR>
Of darkness we fight<BR>
Already our hate has dismayed.<BR>
And he who captured my ring,<BR>
Wotan, the ravening robber,<BR>
By one of his sons<BR>
In fight has been vanquished;<BR>
He has lost<BR>
Through the W&auml;lsung power and might.<BR>
With the whole immortal race<BR>
He awaits in anguish his downfall.<BR>
Him I fear no more:<BR>
He and all his must perish!<BR>
Hagen, son, art asleep?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Remains motionless as before</I>.]</P>
<P>The might of the Gods<BR>
Who then shall wield?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Alberich</P>
<P>I--and thou!<BR>
The world we shall own,<BR>
If in thy truth<BR>
I rightly trust,<BR>
Sharest thou my hate and wrath.<BR>
Wotan's spear<BR>
Was splintered by Siegfried,</P>

As booty the ring<BR>
When Fafner, the dragon, he slew.<BR>
Power supreme<BR>
He has attained to;</P>

<P>Walhall and Nibelheim bow to his will.<BR>
On this hero undaunted<BR>
My curse falls in vain,<BR>

Nor makes use<BR>
Of its wonderful spell;<BR>
Laughing he burns life away,<BR>
Caring only for love.<BR>
Nothing can serve us<BR>
But his undoing!</P>
<P>Sleepest, Hagen, my son?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>As before</I>.]</P>
<P>Already he speeds<BR>
Through me to his doom.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Alberich</P>
<P>The golden ring--<BR>
'Tis that that we must capture!<BR>
The W&auml;lsung<BR>
By a wise woman is loved.<BR>
If, urged by her,<BR>
To the Rhine's fair daughters<BR>
--Who bewitched me once<BR>
Below in the waves--<BR>
The stolen ring he restored,<BR>
Forever lost were the gold,<BR>
And no guile could win it again.<BR>
Wherefore with ardour<BR>
Aim for the ring.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></P>
<P>I gat thee<BR>
A stranger to fear,<BR>
That against heroes<BR>
Thou mightst uphold me.<BR>
I had not the strength,<BR>
Indeed, to despatch,<BR>
Like the Walsung, Fafner in fight;<BR>
But I reared Hagen<BR>
To deadly hatred,<BR>
And he shall avenge me--<BR>
Shall win the ring,<BR>
Putting W&auml;lsung and Wotan to scorn!<BR>
Swear to me, Hagen, my son!</P>
<P>[<I>From this point Alberich is covered by an ever-deepening shadow. At the same time day begins to dawn</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Still as before</I>.]</P>
<P>The ring shall be mine yet;<BR>
Quietly wait!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Alberich</P>
<P>Swear to me, Hagen, my son!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>To myself swear I;<BR>
Make thy mind easy!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Alberich</P>
<P>[<I>Still gradually disappearing, and his voice, as he does so, becoming more and more inaudible</I>.]</P>
<P>Be true, Hagen, my son!<BR>
Trusty hero, be true!<BR>
Be true!--True!</P>
<P>[<I>Alberich has quite disappeared. Hagen, who has never changed position, looks with fixed eyes and without moving towards the Rhine, over which the light of dawn is spreading</I>.]</P>

<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">The gradually brightening red of dawn is reflected in the Rhine. Siegfried<BR>
steps out suddenly from behind a bush close to the shore. He appears<BR>
in his own shape, but has the Tarnhelm on his head still; he takes<BR>
this off, and, as he comes forward, hangs it on his girdle</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Hoioh! Hagen!<BR>
Weary man!<BR>
Where is thy welcome?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Rising in a leisurely fashion</I>.]</P>
<P>Hei! Siegfried?<BR>
Swift-footed hero,<BR>
Whence stormest thou now?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>From Br&uuml;nnhilde's rock.<BR>
'Twas there that I drew the breath<BR>
I called to thee with;<BR>
A quick passage I made!<BR>
Slower behind me a pair<BR>
On board a vessel come.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Hast thou won Br&uuml;nnhild'?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Wakes Gutrune?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Calling towards the hall</I>.]</P>
<P>Hoiho! Gutrune!<BR>
Haste and come!<BR>
Siegfried is here.<BR>
Why dost delay?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>[<I>Turning to the hall</I>.]</P>
<P>How Br&uuml;nnhild' yielded<BR>
Ye shall both be told.</P>
<P>[<I>Gutrune comes from the hall to meet him</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Give me fair greeting,<BR>
Gibich's child!<BR>
I come to thee with joyful news.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Freia greet thee<BR>
To the honour of all women!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>To thy lover glad<BR>
Be gracious;<BR>
For wife I have won thee to-day.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Comes then Br&uuml;nnhild' with my brother?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>None ever wooed with more ease.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Was he not scorched by the fire?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>It had not burnt him, I trow;<BR>
But I broke through it instead,<BR>
That I for wife might win thee.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>And no harm didst thou take?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>I laughed 'mid the surge of the flames.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Did Br&uuml;nnhild' think thee Gunther?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Like were we to a hair;<BR>
The Tarnhelm saw to that,<BR>
As Hagen truly foretold.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>I gave thee counsel good.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>And so the bold maid was tamed?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Her pride--Gunther broke.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Did she give herself to thee?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Through the night the vanquished Br&uuml;nnhild'<BR>
To her rightful husband belonged.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>For her husband thou didst pass?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>By Gutrune sojourned Siegfried.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>But 'twas Br&uuml;nnhild' lay beside thee.</P>

<P>Far as north from east and west,<BR>
So far was Br&uuml;nnhild' removed.</P>

<P>But how got Gunther his wife from thee?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Through the flames of the fire as they faded,<BR>
When day dawned, through the mist<BR>
She followed me down the hill;<BR>
When near the shore,<BR>
None observing,<BR>
I gave Gunther my place,<BR>
And by the Tarnhelm's magic<BR>
Wished myself straight to thee.<BR>
A strong wind drives the lovers<BR>
Merrily down the Rhine;<BR>
Prepare to greet them with joy.</P>

<P>Let us give her gracious greeting,<BR>
That glad and gay she here may tarry!<BR>
Thou, Hagen, prithee<BR>
Summon the men<BR>
To the hall here for the wedding,<BR>
While blithe maids<BR>
To the feast I bid;<BR>
Our joy they will merrily share.</P>

Without delay!<BR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Vassals</P>
<P>Is he in straits,<BR>
Pressed by the foe?</P>

When the beasts we have slain?</P>

<P>The drink-horn take<BR>
That women sweet<BR>
With wine and mead<BR>
Blithely have filled.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Vassals</P>
<P>The drink-horn in hand,<BR>
What task awaits us still?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Gaily carouse<BR>
Until tamed by wine:<BR>
Drink, that the Gods, duly honoured,<BR>

Laugh on the Rhine,<BR>

To wedding-feasts<BR>
Hagen invites;<BR>

Yonder come Br&uuml;nnhild' and he.</P>

This ring, I know,<BR>
Was the booty won<BR>
When at Neidh&ouml;hl' boldly I fought,<BR>
And the mighty dragon was slain.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Stepping between them</I>.]</P>
<P>Br&uuml;nnhild', dauntless queen,<BR>
Knowest thou this ring well?<BR>
If it was by Gunther won,<BR>
Then it is his,<BR>
And Siegfried has got it by guile.<BR>
For his guilt must the traitor pay.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Shrieking in terrible anguish</I>.]</P>
<P>Betrayed! Betrayed!<BR>
Shamefully betrayed!<BR>
Deceived! Deceived!<BR>
Wrong too deep for revenge!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>A wrong? To whom?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Vassals and Women</P>
<P>Deceit? To whom?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Holy Gods!<BR>
Ye heavenly rulers!<BR>
Whispered ye this<BR>
In councils dark?<BR>
If I must bear<BR>
More than ever was borne,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A></P>
<P>Bowed by a shame<BR>
None ever endured,<BR>
Teach me such vengeance<BR>
As never was raved!<BR>
Kindle such wrath<BR>
As can never be calmed!<BR>
Order Br&uuml;nnhild's<BR>
Poor heart to be broken,<BR>
Bring ye but doom<BR>
On him who betrayed!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Br&uuml;nnhild', dear wife,<BR>
Control thyself!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Away, betrayer!<BR>
Self-betrayed one!<BR>
All of you, hearken!<BR>
Not he,<BR>
But that man there,<BR>
Won me to wife.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Vassals and Women</P>
<P>Siegfried? Gutrune's lord?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>He forced delight<BR>
And love from me.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Dost thou so lightly<BR>
Hold thine honour,<BR>
The tongue that thus defames it<BR>
I must convict of its falsehood.<BR>
Hear whether faith I broke!<BR>
Blood-brotherhood<BR>
I have sworn unto Gunther;<BR>
Nothung, my trusty sword,<BR>
Guarded the sacred vow;<BR>
'Twixt me and this sad woman distraught<BR>
Its blade lay sharp.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Behold how thou liest,<BR>
Crafty man,<BR>
Vainly as witness<BR>
Citing thy sword!<BR>
Full well I know its keenness,<BR>
And also the scabbard<BR>
Wherein so snugly<BR>
Hung on the wall<BR>
Nothung, the faithful friend,<BR>
When its lord won the woman he loved.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Vassals and Women</P>
<P>[<I>Crowd together in violent indignation</I>.]</P>
<P>What! Siegfried a traitor?<BR>
Has he stained Gunther's honour?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>To Siegfried</I>.]</P>
<P>Disgraced were I<BR>
And sullied my name,<BR>
Were not the slander<BR>
Cast in her teeth!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gutrune</P>
<P>Siegfried faithless?<BR>
False to his vow?<BR>
Ah, prove thou that worthless<BR>
Is her word!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Vassals</P>
<P>Clear thyself straight;<BR>
If thou art wronged<BR>
Silence the slander;<BR>
Sworn be the oath!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>If I must swear,<BR>
The slander to still,<BR>
Which of you offers<BR>
His sword for the oath?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Swear the oath upon</P>
<P><A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A></P>
<P>The point of my spear;<BR>
Bad faith 'twill surely avenge.</P>
<P>[<I>The vassals form a ring round Siegfried and Hagen. Hagen holds out the spear; Siegfried lays two fingers of his right hand upon the point</I>.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Shining steel!<BR>
Weapon most holy,<BR>
Witness my oath sworn for ever!<BR>
On this spear's sharp point<BR>
I solemnly swear;<BR>
Spear-point, mark thou my words!<BR>
If weapon must pierce me,<BR>
Thine be the point!<BR>
When by death I am stricken<BR>
Strike thou the blow,<BR>
If what she tells is true,<BR>
And I broke faith with my friend!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Strides furiously into the ring, tears Siegfried's hand from the spear, and grasps the point with her own</I>.]</P>
<P>Shining steel!<BR>
Weapon most holy,<BR>
Witness my oath sworn for ever!<BR>
On this spear's sharp point<BR>
I solemnly swear!<BR>
Spear-point, mark thou my words!<BR>
Devoted be thy might<BR>
To his undoing!<BR>
Be thy sharpness blessed by me,<BR>
That it may slay him!<BR>
For broken his oaths have been all,<BR>
And false is what he has sworn.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Vassals</P>
<P>Help, Donner!<BR>
Roar with thy thunder<BR>
To silence this terrible shame!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Siegfried</P>
<P>Gunther, look to this woman<BR>
Who falsely slanders thy name.<BR>
Let her rest awhile,<BR>
The untamed mountain maid,<BR>
That the unbridled rage some demon<BR>
In malice has<BR>
Against us roused<BR>
May have the chance to subside.<BR>
Ye vassals, go ye your ways;<BR>
Let the womenfolk scold.<BR>
Like cravens gladly we yield,<BR>
Comes it to fighting with tongues.</P>
<P>[<I>He goes up to Gunther</I>.]</P>
<P>Thou art not so vexed as I<BR>
That I beguiled her ill;<BR>
The Tarnhelm must, I fear,<BR>
But half have hid my face.<BR>
Still, women's wrath<BR>
Soon is appeased:<BR>
That I won her for thee<BR>
Thankful thy wife will be yet.</P>
<P>[<I>He turns again to the vassals</I>.]</P>
<P>Follow me, men,<BR>
With mirth to the feast!</P>
<P>[<I>To the women</I>.]</P>
<P>Gaily, women,<BR>
Help at the wedding!<BR>
Joyfully laugh<BR>
Love and delight!<BR>
In hall and grove<BR>
There shall be none<BR>
This day more merry than I!<BR>
Ye whom love has blessed,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A></P>
<P>Like myself light-hearted,<BR>
Follow and share in my mirth!</P>
<P>[<I>He throws his arm in the highest spirits round Gutrune and draws her into the hall. The vassals and women follow, carried away by his example. All go off, except Br&uuml;nnhilde, Gunther, and Hagen. Gunther, in deep shame and dejection, with his face covered, has seated himself on one side. Br&uuml;nnhilde, standing in the foreground, gazes for some time sorrowfully after Siegfried and Gutrune, then droops her head</I>.]</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Lost in thought</I>.]</P>
<P>What dread demon's might<BR>
Moves here in darkness?<BR>
By what wizard's spell<BR>
Worked was the woe?<BR>
How weak is my wisdom<BR>
Faced by this puzzle!<BR>
And where shall I find<BR>
The runes for this riddle?<BR>
Oh, sorrow! Sorrow!<BR>
Woe's me! Woe's me!<BR>
I gave all my wisdom to him;</P>
<P>[<I>With increasing emotion</I>.]</P>
<P>The maid in his power<BR>
He holds.<BR>
Fast in his fetters<BR>
Bound is the booty<BR>
That, weeping her grievous shame,<BR>
Gaily to others he gives!<BR>
Will none of you lend a sword<BR>
With which I may sever my bonds?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Going close to Br&uuml;nnhilde</I>.]</P>
<P>Leave that to me,<BR>
O wife betrayed;<BR>
I will avenge<BR>
Thy trust deceived.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>Looking round dully</I>.]</P>
<P>On whom?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>On Siegfried, traitor to thee.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>On Siegfried? Thou?</P>
<P>[<I>Smiling bitterly</I>.]</P>
<P>One single flash<BR>
Of his eye and its lightning--<BR>
Which streamed in its glory on me<BR>
Even through his disguise--<BR>
And thy heart would fail,<BR>
Shorn of its courage.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>But to my spear<BR>
His perjury gives him.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Truth and falsehood--<BR>
What matter words!<BR>
To arm thy spear<BR>
Seek for something stronger,<BR>
Strength such as his to withstand!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Well know I Siegfried's<BR>
Conquering strength:<BR>
How hard in battle to slay him;<BR>
But whisper to me<BR>
Some sure device<BR>
For speeding him to his doom.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>Ungrateful, shameful return!<BR>
I taught him all<BR>
The arts I know,<BR>
To preserve his body from harm.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></P>
<P>He bears unwitting<BR>
A charmed life<BR>
And safely walks by spells enwound.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Then no weapon forged could wound him?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>In battle none;--yet--<BR>
Did the blow strike his back!<BR>
Never--I knew that--<BR>
Would he give way,<BR>
Or turn and fly, the foe pursuing,<BR>
So there I gave him no blessing.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>And there shall my spear strike!</P>
<P>[<I>He turns quickly from Br&uuml;nnhilde to Gunther</I>.]</P>
<P>Up, Gunther,<BR>
Noble Gibichung!<BR>
Here stands thy valiant wife.<BR>
Why hang thy head in grief?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Starting up passionately</I>.]</P>
<P>O shame!<BR>
Dishonour!<BR>
Woe is me!<BR>
No man has known such sorrow!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>In shame thou liest--<BR>
That is true.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>[<I>To Gunther</I>.]</P>
<P>O craven man!<BR>
Falsest of friends!<BR>
Hidden behind<BR>
The hero wert thou<BR>
While won were for thee<BR>
The prize and the glory.<BR>
Low indeed<BR>
The race must have sunk<BR>
That breeds such cowards as thou!</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Beside himself</I>.]</P>
<P>Deceived am I--and deceiver!<BR>
Betrayed am I--and betrayer!<BR>
My strength be consumed,<BR>
And broken my heart!<BR>
Help, Hagen!<BR>
Help for my honour!<BR>
Help, for my mother was thine--<BR>
Thee too she bore!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>No help from head<BR>
Or hand will suffice:<BR>
'Tis Siegfried's death we need.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Seized with horror</I>.]</P>
<P>Siegfried's death?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Unpurged else were thy shame.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Staring before him</I>.]</P>
<P>Blood-brotherhood<BR>
He and I swore.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Who broke the bond<BR>
Pays with his blood.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Broke he the bond?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>In betraying thee.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>Was I betrayed?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde</P>
<P>He betrayed thee,<BR>
And me ye all are betraying!<BR>
If I were just,<BR>
All the blood of the world<BR>
Would not atone for your guilt!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A></P>
<P>But the death of one<BR>
Is all I ask for.<BR>
Dying, Siegfried<BR>
Atones for himself and you!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>[<I>Turning to Gunther and appealing to him secretly</I>.]</P>
<P>His death would profit thee;<BR>
Boundless were indeed thy might<BR>
If thou couldst capture the ring,<BR>
Which, alive, he never will yield.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Softly</I>.]</P>
<P>Br&uuml;nnhilde's ring?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>The ring the Niblung wrought.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>
<P>[<I>Sighing deeply</I>.]</P>
<P>'Twould be the end of Siegfried.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>His death would serve us all.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Gunther</P>

He has been given!<BR>
How could we look in her face<BR>
If her husband we had slain?</P>

<P>[<I>Starting up furiously</I>.]</P>
<P>What wisdom forewarned of,<BR>
And runes hinted darkly,<BR>
In helpless despair<BR>
Is plain to me now.</P>
<P>[<I>Passionately</I>.]</P>
<P>Gutrune is the spell<BR>
That stole my husband's heart away!<BR>
Woe be her lot!</P>

<P>If this grief we must give her,<BR>
Conceal how Siegfried died.</P>

<P>We go to-morrow<BR>
Merrily hunting;<BR>
The hero gallops ahead;<BR>
We find him slain by a boar.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Br&uuml;nnhilde and Gunther</P>
<P>So shall it be!<BR>
Perish Siegfried!<BR>
Purged be the shame<BR>
He brought on me!<BR>
Faith sworn by oath<BR>

Now with his blood<BR>
Let him atone!<BR>
Avenging,<BR>
All-hearing God!<BR>
Oath-witness,<BR>
And lord of vows!<BR>
Wotan, come at my call!<BR>
Send thou thine awful<BR>
Heavenly host<BR>
Hither to hear<BR>
While I vow revenge!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hagen</P>
<P>Doomed let him die,<BR>
The hero renowned!<BR>
Mine is the hoard,<BR>
And mine I shall hold it!<BR>
From him the ring<BR>
Shall be wrested!<BR>
Niblung father!</P>
<P>O fallen prince!<BR>
Night warder<BR>
Nibelung lord<BR>
Alberich! Hear thou thy son!</P>

O'er the Nibelung host,<BR>
Bid them obey thee,<BR>
The ring's dread lord!</P>
<P>[<I>As Gunther turns impetuously towards the hall with Br&uuml;nnhilde they are met by the bridal procession coming out. Boys and girls, waving flower-wreathed staves, leap merrily in front. The vassals are carrying Siegfried on a shield and Gutrune on a seat. On the rising ground at the back men-servants and maids are taking implements and beasts for sacrifice, by the various mountain-paths, to the altars, which they deck with flowers. Siegfried and the vassals blow wedding-calls on their horns. The women invite Br&uuml;nnhilde to accompany them to Gutrune's side. Br&uuml;nnhilde stares blankly at Gutrune, who beckons her with a friendly smile. Is Br&uuml;nnhilde is about to step back angrily Hagen comes quickly between them and presses her to wards Gunther, who takes her hand again, whereupon he allows himself to be raised on a shield by the men. Is the procession, scarcely interrupted, moves on quickly again towards the height, the curtain falls</I>.]</P>
