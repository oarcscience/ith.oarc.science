<P>This is the 'Gododdin'. Aneurin composed it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I</P>
<P>Of manly disposition was the youth,<BR>
Valour had he in the tumult;<BR>
Fleet thick-maned chargers<BR>
Were under the thigh of the illustrious youth;<BR>
A shield, light and broad,<BR>
Was on the slender swift flank,<BR>
A sword, blue and bright,<BR>
Golden spurs, and ermine.<BR>
It is not by me<BR>
That hatred shall be shown to thee;<BR>
I will do better towards thee,<BR>
To celebrate thee in poetic eulogy.<BR>
Sooner hadst thou gone to the bloody bier<BR>
Than to the nuptial feast;<BR>
Sooner hadst thou gone to be food for ravens<BR>
Than to the conflict of spears;<BR>
Thou beloved friend of Owain!<BR>
Wrong it is that he should be under ravens.<BR>
It is evident in what region<BR>
The only son of Marro was killed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P>Caeawg, the leader, wherever he came,<BR>
Breathless in the presence of a maid would he distribute the mead;<BR>
The front of his shield was pierced, when he heard<BR>
The shout of battle, he would give no quarter wherever he pursued;<BR>
He would not retreat from the combat, until he caused<BR>
Blood to stream; like rushes would he hew down the men who would<BR>
not yield.<BR>
The Gododdin does not relate, in the land of Mordai,<BR>
Before the tents of Madawg, when he returned,<BR>
Of but one man in a hundred that came back.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">III</P>
<P>Caeawg, the combatant, the stay of his country,<BR>
Whose attack is like the rush of the eagle into the sea, when allured by<BR>
his prey;<BR>
He formed a compact, his signal was observed;<BR>
Better was his resolution performed: he retreated not<BR>
Before the host of Gododdin, at the close of day.<BR>
With confidence he pressed upon the conflict of Manawyd;<BR>
And regarded neither spear nor shield.<BR>
There is not to be found a habitation that abounded in dainties,<BR>
That has been kept from the attack of the warriors.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">IV</P>
<P>Caeawg, the leader, the wolf of the strand,<BR>
Amber wreaths encircled his brow;<BR>
Precious was the amber, worth wine from the horn.<BR>
He repelled the violence of ignoble men, and blood trickled down;<BR>
For Gwynedd and the North would have come to his share,<BR>
By the advice of the son of Ysgyrran,<BR>
Who wore the broken shield.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">V</P>
<P>Caeawg, the leader, armed was he in the noisy conflict;<BR>
His was the foremost part of the advanced division, in front of the hosts.<BR>
Before his blades fell five battalions.<BR>
Of the men of Deivyr and Brenneich, uttering groans:<BR>
Twenty hundred perished in one hour.<BR>
Sooner did his flesh go to the wolf, than he to the nuptial feast;<BR>
He sooner became food for the raven, than approached the altar;<BR>
Before he entered the conflict of spears, his blood streamed to the ground.<BR>
It was the price of mead in the hall, amidst the throng.<BR>
Hyveidd Hir shall be celebrated as long as there will be a minstrel.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">VI</P>
<P>The men went to Gododdin with laughter and sprightliness,<BR>
Bitter were they in the battle, displaying their blades;<BR>
A short year they remained in peace.<BR>
The son of Bodgad, by the energy of his hand, caused a throbbing.<BR>
Though they went to churches to do penance,<BR>
The old, and the young, and the bold-handed,<BR>
The inevitable strife of death was to pierce them.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">VII</P>
<P>The men went to Gododdin, laughing as they moved:<BR>
A gloomy disaster befell their army;<BR>
Thou slayest them with blades, without much noise:<BR>
Thou, powerful pillar of living right, causest stillness.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">VIII</P>
<P>The men went to Catraeth, loquacious was their host;<BR>
Fresh mead was their feast, and also their poison.<BR>
Three hundred were contending with weapons;<BR>
And after sportive mirth, stillness ensued!<BR>
Though they went to churches to do penance,<BR>
The inevitable strife of death was to pierce them.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">IX</P>
<P>The men went to Catraeth, fed with mead, and drunk.<BR>
Firm and vigorous; it were wrong if I neglected to praise them.<BR>
Around the red, mighty, and murky blades<BR>
Obstinately and fiercely fought the dogs of war.<BR>
If I had judged you to be on the side of the tribe of Brenneich,<BR>
Not the phantom of a man would I have left alive.<BR>
A friend I have lost, myself being unhurt;<BR>
He openly opposed the terrible chief -<BR>
The magnanimous hero did not seek the dowry of his father-in-law;<BR>
The son of Cian of Maen Gwyngwn.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">X</P>
<P>The men went to Catraeth with the dawn;<BR>
They dealt peaceably with those who feared them.<BR>
A hundred thousand and three hundred engaged in mutual overthrow.<BR>
Drenched in gore they served as butts for lances;<BR>
Their post they most manfully defended<BR>
Before the retinue of Mynyddawg Mwynvawr.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XI</P>
<P>The men went to Catraeth with the dawn;<BR>
Regretted are their absence and their disposition;<BR>
Mead they drank, yellow, sweet, ensnaring.<BR>
In that year many a minstrel fell.<BR>
Redder were their swords than their plumes.<BR>
Their blades were white as lime, their helmets split into four parts,<BR>
Before the retinue of Mynyddawg Mwynvawr.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XII</P>
<P>The men went to Catraeth with the day:<BR>
Have not the best of battles their disgrace?<BR>
They made biers a matter of necessity.<BR>
With blades full of vigour in defence of Baptism.<BR>
This is best before the alliance of kindred.<BR>
Exceedingly great was the bloodshed and death, of which they were the cause,<BR>
Before the army of Gododdin, when the day occurred.<BR>
Is not a double quantity of discretion the best strengthener of a hero?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XIII</P>
<P>The man went to Catraeth with the day:<BR>
Truly he quaffed the foaming mead on serene nights;<BR>
He was unlucky, though proverbially fortunate:<BR>
His mission, through ambition, was that of a destroyer.<BR>
There hastened not to Catraeth<BR>
A chief so magnificent<BR>
As to his design on the standard.<BR>
Never was there such a host<BR>
From the fort of Eiddyn,<BR>
That would scatter abroad the mounted ravagers.<BR>
Tudvwlch Hir, near his land and towns,<BR>
Slaughtered the Saxons for seven days.<BR>
His valour remained until he was overpowered;<BR>
And his memory will remain among his fair associates.<BR>
When Tudvwlch, the supporter of the land, arrived,<BR>
The station of the son of Cilydd became a plain of blood.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XIV</P>
<P>The man went to Catraeth with the dawn;<BR>
To them were their shields a protection.<BR>
Blood they sought, the gleamers assembled:<BR>
Simultaneously, like thunder, arose the din of shields.<BR>
The man of envy, the deserter, and the base,<BR>
He would tear and pierce with pikes.<BR>
From an elevated position, he slew, with a blade,<BR>
In iron affliction, a steel-clad commander;<BR>
He subdued in Mordai those that owed him homage;<BR>
Before Erthgi armies groaned.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XV</P>
<P>Of the battle of Catraeth, when it shall be related,<BR>
The people will utter sighs; long has been their sorrow.<BR>
There will be a dominion without a sovereign, and a murky land.<BR>
The sons of Godebawg, an upright clan,<BR>
Bore, streaming, long biers.<BR>
Sad was the fate, just the necessity,<BR>
Decreed to Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch Hir.<BR>
Together they drank the clear mead<BR>
By the light of the rushes,<BR>
Though pleasant to the taste, its banefulness lasted long.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XVI</P>
<P>Before Echeching, the splendid Caer, he shouted:<BR>
Young and forward men followed him;<BR>
Before, on the Bludwe the horn was poured out<BR>
In the joyful Mordai;<BR>
Before, his drink would be bragget;<BR>
Before, gold and rich purple he would display;<BR>
Before, high-fed horses would bear him safe away;<BR>
Gwrthlev and he, when he poured out the liquor,<BR>
Before, he would raise the shout, and there would be a profitable diminution;<BR>
He was a bear in his march, always unwilling to skulk.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XVII</P>
<P>And now the early leader,<BR>
The sun is ascending,<BR>
The sovereign from which emanates universal light.<BR>
In the heaven of the Isle of Prydain.<BR>
Direful was the flight before the shaking<BR>
Of the shield in the direction of the victor;<BR>
Bright was the horn<BR>
In the hall of Eiddyn;<BR>
With pomp was he invited<BR>
To the feast of the intoxicating mead;<BR>
He drank the beverage of wine<BR>
At the meeting of the reapers;<BR>
He drank transparent wine,<BR>
With a daring purpose.<BR>
The reapers sing of war,<BR>
War with the shining wing;<BR>
The minstrels sang of war,<BR>
Of harnessed war,<BR>
Of winged war.<BR>
No shield was unexpanded<BR>
In the conflict of spears;<BR>
Of equal eye they fell<BR>
In the struggle of battle.<BR>
Unshaken in the tumult,<BR>
Without dishonour did he retaliate;<BR>
His will had to be conciliated<BR>
Ere became a green sward<BR>
The grave of Gwrvelling the great.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XVIII</P>
<P>Qualities they will honour.<BR>
Three forward (chiefs or bands) of Novant,<BR>
A battalion of five hundred;<BR>
Three chiefs and three hundred;<BR>
There are three Knights of battle.<BR>
From Eiddyn, arrayed in golden armour,<BR>
Three loricated hosts.<BR>
Three Kings wearing the golden torques;<BR>
Three bold Knights.<BR>
Three equal battles;<BR>
Three of the same order, mutually jealous.<BR>
Bitterly would they chase the foe;<BR>
Three dreadful in the conflict;<BR>
Lions, that would kill dead as lead.<BR>
There was in the war a collection of gold;<BR>
Three sovereigns of the people.<BR>
Came from the Brython,<BR>
Cynri and Cenon<BR>
And Cynrain from Aeron,<BR>
To greet with ashen lances.<BR>
The Deivyr distillers.<BR>
Came there from the Brython,<BR>
A better man than Cynon,<BR>
A serpent to his sullen foes?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XIX</P>
<P>I drank mead and wine in Mordai,<BR>
Great was the quantity of spears<BR>
In the assembly of the warriors.<BR>
He prepared food for the eagle.<BR>
When Cydywal sallied forth, he raised<BR>
The shout with the green dawn, and dealt out tribulation;<BR>
Splintered shields about the ground he left,<BR>
With darts of awful tearing did he hew down;<BR>
In the battle, the foremost in the van<BR>
The son of Syvno wounded; the astronomer knew it.<BR>
He who sold his life,<BR>
In the face of warning,<BR>
With sharpened blades committed slaughter;<BR>
But he himself was slain by crosses and spears.<BR>
According to the compact, he meditated an attack,<BR>
And admired a pile of carcases<BR>
Of gallant men of toil,<BR>
Whom in the upper part of Gwynedd he pierced.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XX</P>
<P>I drank wine and mead in Mordai,<BR>
And because I drank, I fell by the side of the rampart; the fate of allurement.<BR>
Colwedd the brave was not without ambition.<BR>
When all fell, thou didst also fall.<BR>
Thus, when the issue comes, it were well if thou hadst not sinned.<BR>
Present, it was related, was a person of a daring arm.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXI</P>
<P>The men went to Catraeth; they were renowned;<BR>
Wine and mead from golden cups was their beverage;<BR>
That year was to them of exalted solemnity;<BR>
Three warriors and three score and three hundred, wearing the golden torques.<BR>
Of those who hurried forth after the excess of revelling,<BR>
But three escaped by the prowess of the gashing sword,<BR>
The two war-dogs of Aeron, and Cenon the dauntless,<BR>
And myself from the spilling of my blood, the reward of my sacred song.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXII</P>
<P>My friend in real distress, we should have been by none disturbed,<BR>
Had not the white Commander led forth (his army):<BR>
We should not have been separated in the hall from the banquet of mead,<BR>
Had he not laid waste our convenient position.<BR>
He who is base in the field, is base on the hearth.<BR>
Truly the Gododdin relates that after the gashing assault,<BR>
There was none more ardent than Llivieu.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXIII</P>
<P>Scattered, broken, of motionless form, is the weapon,<BR>
To which it was highly congenial to prostrate the horde of the Lloegrians.<BR>
Shields were strewn in the entrance, shields in the battle of lances;<BR>
He reduced men to ashes,<BR>
And made women widows,<BR>
Before his death.<BR>
Graid, the son of Hoewgi,<BR>
With spears,<BR>
He caused the effusion of blood.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXIV</P>
<P>Adan was the hero of the two shields<BR>
Whose front was variegated, and motion like that of a war-steed.<BR>
There was tumult in the mount of slaughter, there was fire,<BR>
Impetuous were the lances, there was sunshine,<BR>
There was food for ravens, for the raven there was profit.<BR>
And before he would let them go free,<BR>
With the morning dew, like the eagle in his pleasant course,<BR>
He scattered them on either side as they advanced forward.<BR>
The Bards of the world will pronounce an opinion on men of valour.<BR>
No ransom would avail those whom his standard pursued.<BR>
The spears in the hands of the warriors were causing devastation.<BR>
And ere was interred under his horses,<BR>
One who had been energetic in his commands,<BR>
His blood had thoroughly washed his armour:<BR>
Buddvan, the son of Bleiddvan the Bold.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXV</P>
<P>It were wrong to leave him without a memorial, a great wrong.<BR>
He would not leave an open gap through cowardice;<BR>
The benefit of the minstrels of Prydain never quitted his court.<BR>
On the calends of January, according to his design.<BR>
His land was not ploughed, since it lay waste.<BR>
He was a mighty dragon of indignant disposition,<BR>
A commander in the bloody field after the banquet of wine;--<BR>
Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen, of the strife of Catraeth.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXVI</P>
<P>True it was, as songs relate,<BR>
No one's steed overtook Marchleu.<BR>
The lances of the commander<BR>
From his prancing horse, strewed a thick path.<BR>
As he was reared to bring slaughter and support.<BR>
Furious was the stroke of his protecting sword;<BR>
Ashen shafts were scattered from the grasp of his hand.<BR>
From the stony pile;<BR>
He delighted to spread destruction.<BR>
He would slaughter with a variegated sword from a furze-bush;<BR>
As when a company of reapers comes in the interval of fine weather,<BR>
Would Marchleu cause the blood to flow.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXVII</P>
<P>Issac was sent from the southern region;<BR>
His conduct resembled the flowing sea;<BR>
He was full of modesty and gentleness,<BR>
When he delightfully drank the mead.<BR>
But along the rampart of Offer to the point of Maddeu,<BR>
He was not fierce without heroism, nor did he attempt scattering without effecting it,<BR>
His sword resounded in the mouths of mothers;<BR>
He was an ardent spirit, praise be to him, the son of Gwyddneu.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXVIII</P>
<P>Ceredig, lovely is his fame;<BR>
He would gain distinction, and preserve it;<BR>
Gentle, lowly, calm, before the day arrived<BR>
In which he learned the achievements of the brave:<BR>
May it be the lot of the friend of songs to arrive<BR>
In the country of heaven, and recognize his home!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXIX</P>
<P>Ceredig, amiable leader,<BR>
A wrestler in the impetuous fight;<BR>
His gold-bespangled shield was conspicuous on the battle-field,<BR>
His lances were broken, and shattered into splinters,<BR>
The stroke of his sword was fierce and penetrating;<BR>
Like a man would he maintain his post.<BR>
Before he received the affliction of earth, before the fatal blow.<BR>
He had fulfilled his in guarding his station.<BR>
May he find a complete reception<BR>
With the Trinity in perfect unity.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXX</P>
<P>When Caradawg rushed to battle,<BR>
Like the woodland boar was the gash of the hewer;<BR>
He was the bull of battle in the conflicting fight;<BR>
He allured wild dogs with his hand.<BR>
My witnesses are Owain the son of Eulad,<BR>
And Gwryen, and Gwyn, and Gwryad.<BR>
From Catraeth, from the conflict,<BR>
From Bryn Hydwn, before it was taken,<BR>
After having clear mead in his hand,<BR>
Gwrien did not see his father.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXI</P>
<P>The men marched with speed, together they bounded onward;<BR>
Short-lived were they--having become drunk over the clarified mead.<BR>
The retinue of Mynyddawg, renowned in a trial,<BR>
Their life was the price of their banquet of mead; -<BR>
Caradawg and Madawg, Pyll and Ieuan,<BR>
Gwgawn and Gwiawn, Gwyn and Cynvan,<BR>
Peredur with steel arms, Gwawrddur and Aeddan.<BR>
A defence were they in the tumult, though with shattered shields,<BR>
When they were slain, they also slaughtered;<BR>
Not one to his native home returned.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXII</P>
<P>The men marched with speed, together were they regaled<BR>
That year over mead; great was their design:<BR>
How sad to mention them! how grievous the longing for them!<BR>
Their retreat was poison; no mother's son nurses them.<BR>
How long the vexation and how long the regret for them -<BR>
For the brave men of the wine-fed region!<BR>
Gwlyged of Gododdin, having partaken of the inciting<BR>
Banquet of Mynyddawg, performed illustrious deeds,<BR>
And dear was the price he gave for the purchase of the conflict of Catraeth.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXIII</P>
<P>The men went to Catraeth in battle-array and with shout of war,<BR>
With the strength of steeds, and with dark-brown harness, and with shields,<BR>
With uplifted javelins, and sharp lances,<BR>
With glittering mail, and with swords.<BR>
He excelled, he penetrated through the host,<BR>
Five battalions fell before his blade;<BR>
Ruvawn Hir,--he gave gold to the altar,<BR>
And gifts and precious stones to the minstrel.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXIV</P>
<P>No hall was ever made so loquacious,--<BR>
So great, so magnificent for the slaughter.<BR>
Morien procured and spread the fire,<BR>
He would not say that Cenon would not make a corpse<BR>
Of one harnessed, armed with a pike, and of wide-spread fame.<BR>
His sword resounded on the top of the rampart.<BR>
No more than a huge stone can be removed from its fixed place<BR>
Will Gwid, the son of Peithan, be moved.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXV</P>
<P>No hall was ever so full of delegates:<BR>
Had not Moryen been like Caradawg,<BR>
With difficulty could he have escaped towards Mynawg.<BR>
Fierce, he was fiercer than the son of Fferawg;<BR>
Stout was his hand, he set flames to the retreating horsemen.<BR>
Terrible in the city was the cry of the multitude;<BR>
The van of the army of Gododdin was scattered;<BR>
In the day of wrath he was nimble--and was he not destructive in retaliating?<BR>
The dependants of Mynyddawg deserved their horns of mead.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXVI</P>
<P>No hall was ever made so immovable<BR>
As that of Cynon of the gentle breast, sovereign of valuable treasures.<BR>
He sat no longer at the upper end of the high seat.<BR>
Those whom he pierced were not pierced again;<BR>
Sharp was the point of his lance;<BR>
With his enamelled armour he penetrated through the troops;<BR>
Swift in the van were the horses, in the van they tore along.<BR>
In the day of wrath, destruction attended his blade,<BR>
When Cynon rushed forward with the green dawn.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXVII</P>
<P>A grievous descent was made on his native place;<BR>
He repelled aggression, he fixed a boundary;<BR>
His spear forcibly pushed the laughing chiefs of war:<BR>
Even as far as Effyd reached his valour, which was like that of Elphin;<BR>
Eithinyn the renowned, an ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXVIII</P>
<P>A grievous descent was made on his native place,<BR>
The price of mead in the hall, and the feast of wine;<BR>
His blades were scattered about between two armies,<BR>
Illustrious was the knight in front of Gododdin.<BR>
Eithinyn the renowned, an ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XXXIX</P>
<P>A grievous descent was made in front of the extended riches;<BR>
The army dispersed with trailing shields.--<BR>
A shivered shield before the herd of the roaring Beli.<BR>
A dwarf from the bloody field hastened to the fence;<BR>
On our part there came a hoary-headed man to take counsel.<BR>
On a prancing steed, bearing a message from the golden-torqued leader.<BR>
Twrch proposed a compact in front of the destructive course:<BR>
Worthy was the shout of refusal;<BR>
We cried, 'Let heaven be our protection;<BR>
Let his compact be that he should be prostrated by the spear in battle.'<BR>
The warriors of the far-famed Aclud<BR>
Would not contend without prostrating his host to the ground.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XL</P>
<P>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned man,<BR>
For the fair corpse which fell prostrate on the ground,<BR>
For the failing of the hair from off his head,<BR>
From the grandson of the eagle of Gwydien,<BR>
Did not Gwyddwg defend with his spear,<BR>
Resembling and honouring his master?<BR>
Morieu of the sacred song defended<BR>
The wall, and deposed the head<BR>
Of the chief in the ground, both our support and our sovereign<BR>
Equal to three men, to please the maid, was Bradwen,<BR>
Equal to twelve was Gwenabwy the son of Gwen.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLI</P>
<P>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned man,<BR>
He bore a shield in the action;<BR>
With energy did the stroke of his sword fall on the head.<BR>
In Lloegyr he caused gashings before three hundred chieftains.<BR>
He who takes hold of a wolf's mane without a club<BR>
In his hand, must naturally have a brave disposition under his cloak.<BR>
In the engagement of wrath and carnage<BR>
Bradwen perished--he did not escape.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLII</P>
<P>A man moved rapidly on the wall of the Caer,<BR>
He was of a warlike disposition; neither a house nor a city was actively engaged in battle.<BR>
One weak man, with his shouts,<BR>
Endeavoured to keep off the birds of battle.<BR>
Surely Syll of Mirein relates that there were more<BR>
That had chanced to come from Llwy,<BR>
From around the inlet of the flood;<BR>
Surely he relates that there were more<BR>
At an early hour,<BR>
Equal to Cynhaval in merit.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLIII</P>
<P>When thou, famous conqueror!<BR>
Wast protecting the ear of corn in the uplands<BR>
Deservedly were we said to run like men of mark.<BR>
The entrance to Din Drei was not guarded.<BR>
Such as was fond of treasure took it;<BR>
There was a city for the army that should venture to enter.<BR>
Gwynwyd was not called, where he was not.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLIV</P>
<P>Since there are a hundred men in one house,<BR>
I know the cares of distress.<BR>
The chief of the men must pay the contribution.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLV</P>
<P>I am not headstrong and petulant.<BR>
I will not avenge myself on him who drives me.<BR>
I will not laugh in derision.<BR>
Under foot for a while,<BR>
My knee is stretched,<BR>
My hands are bound,<BR>
In the earthen house,<BR>
With an iron chain<BR>
Around my two knees.<BR>
Yet of the mead from the horn,<BR>
And of the men of Catraeth,<BR>
I, Aneurin, will compose,<BR>
As Taliesin knows,<BR>
An elaborate song,<BR>
Or a strain to Gododdin,<BR>
Before the dawn of the brightest day.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLVI</P>
<P>The chief exploit of the North did the hero accomplish;<BR>
Of a generous breast was he, liberal is his progeny;<BR>
There does not walk upon the earth, mother has not borne.<BR>
Such an illustrious, powerful, iron-clad warrior.<BR>
By the force of the gleaming sword he protected me,<BR>
From the dismal earthen prison he brought me out,<BR>
From the place of death, from a hostile region:--<BR>
Ceneu, the son of Llywarch, energetic, bold.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLVII</P>
<P>He would not bear the reproach of a congress,<BR>
Senyllt, with his vessels full of mead;<BR>
He enriched his sword with deeds of violence;<BR>
He enriched those who rushed to war;<BR>
And with his arm made pools (of blood).<BR>
In front of the armies of Gododdin and Brennych.<BR>
Fleet horses were customary in his hall.<BR>
There was streaming gore, and dark-brown harness.<BR>
A long stream of light there was from his hand.<BR>
And like a hunter shooting with the bow<BR>
Was Gwen; and the attacking parties mutually repulsed each other,<BR>
Friend and foe by turns;<BR>
The men did not cut their way to flee,<BR>
But they were the general defenders of every region.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLVIII</P>
<P>Llech Lleutu and Tud Lleudvre,<BR>
The course of Gododdin,<BR>
The course of Ragno, close at hand,<BR>
The hand that was director of the splendour of battle,<BR>
With the branch of Caerwys.<BR>
Before it was shattered<BR>
By the season of the storm, by the storm of the season,<BR>
To form a rank in front of myriads of men,<BR>
Coming from Dindywydd,<BR>
Excited with rage,<BR>
Deeply did they design,<BR>
Sharply did they pierce,<BR>
Wholly did the host chant,<BR>
Battered was their shield;<BR>
Before the bull of conflict<BR>
Their van was broken.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XLIX</P>
<P>His languid foes trembled greatly,<BR>
Since the battle of most active tumult,<BR>
At the border of Banceirw,<BR>
Around the border of Bancarw;<BR>
The fingers of Brych will break the bar,<BR>
For Pwyll, for Disteir, for Distar,<BR>
For Pwyll, for Roddig, for Rychwardd,<BR>
A strong bow was spent by Rys in Riwdrech.<BR>
They that were not bold did not attain their purpose;<BR>
None escaped that was once overtaken and pierced.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">L</P>
<P>It was no good deed that his shield should be pierced.<BR>
On the side of his horse;<BR>
Not meetly did he place his thigh<BR>
On the long-legged, slender, gray charger.<BR>
Dark was his shaft, dark,<BR>
Darker was his saddle.<BR>
Thy man is in his cell,<BR>
Gnawing the shoulder of a buck;<BR>
May he have the benefit of his hand!<BR>
Far be he!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LI</P>
<P>It was well that Adonwy came to Gwen;<BR>
Gwen was left without Bradwen.<BR>
Thou didst fight, kill, and burn,<BR>
Thou didst not do worse than Moryen;<BR>
Thou didst not regard the rear or the van.<BR>
Of the towering figure without a helmet.<BR>
Thou didst not observe the great swelling sea of knights.<BR>
That would hew down, and grant no quarter to the Saxons.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LII</P>
<P>Gododdin, in respect of thee will I demand<BR>
The dales beyond the ridges of Drum Essyd.<BR>
The slave to the love of money is without self-control.<BR>
By the counsel of thy son let thy valour shine forth.<BR>
It was not a degrading advice.<BR>
In front of Tan Veithin,<BR>
From twilight to twilight, the edge gleamed.<BR>
Glittering exterior had the purple of the pilgrim.<BR>
Gwaws, the defenceless, the delight of the bulwark of battle, was slain.<BR>
His scream was inseparable from Aneurin.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LIII</P>
<P>Together arise the associated warriors,<BR>
To Catraeth the loquacious multitude eagerly march;<BR>
The effect of mead in the hall, and the beverage of wine.<BR>
Blades were scattered between the two armies.<BR>
Illustrious was the knight in front of Gododdin:--<BR>
Eithinyn the renowned, an ardent spirit, the bull of conflict.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LIV</P>
<P>Together arise the associated warriors,<BR>
Strangers to the country, their deeds shall be heard of.<BR>
The bright wave murmured along on its pilgrimage,<BR>
While the young deer were in full melody.<BR>
Among the spears of Brych thou couldst see no rods.<BR>
Merit does not accord with the rear.<BR>
Moryal in pursuit will not countenance evil deeds,<BR>
With his steel blade ready for the effusion of blood.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LV</P>
<P>Together arise the associated warriors.<BR>
Strangers to the country, their deeds shall be heard of.<BR>
There was slaughtering with axes and blades,<BR>
And there was raising large cairns over the men of toil.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LVI</P>
<P>Together arise the warriors, together met,<BR>
And all with one accord sallied forth;<BR>
Short were their lives, long is the grief of those who loved them.<BR>
Seven times their number of Lloegrians they had slain;<BR>
After the conflict women raised a lamentation;<BR>
Many a mother has the tear on her eyelash.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LVII</P>
<P>No hall was ever made so faultless<BR>
Nor a hero so generous, with the aspect of a lion of the greatest course,<BR>
As Cynon of the gentle breast, the most comely lord.<BR>
The city, its fame extends to the remotest parts;<BR>
It was the staying shelter of the army, the benefit of flowing melody.<BR>
In the world, engaged in arms, the battle-cry,<BR>
And war, the most heroic was he;<BR>
He slew the mounted ravagers with the sharpest blade;<BR>
Like rushes did they fall before his hand.<BR>
Son of Clydno, of lasting fame! I will sing<BR>
To thee a song of praise without limit, without end.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LVIII</P>
<P>From the banquet of wine and mead<BR>
They deplored the death<BR>
Of the mother of Hwrreith.<BR>
The energetic Eidiol.<BR>
Honoured her in front of the hill,<BR>
And before Buddugre,<BR>
The hovering ravens<BR>
Ascend in the sky.<BR>
The foremost spearmen fall<BR>
Like a virgin-swarm around him<BR>
Without the semblance of a retreat<BR>
Warriors in wonder shook their javelins,<BR>
With pallid lips,<BR>
Caused by the keenness of the destructive sword.<BR>
Wakeful was the carousal at the beginning of the banquet;<BR>
To-day sleepless is<BR>
The mother of Reiddun, the leader of the tumult.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LIX</P>
<P>From the banquet of wine and mead<BR>
They went to the strife<BR>
Of mail-clad warriors: I know no tale of slaughter which accords<BR>
So complete a destruction as has happened.<BR>
Before Catraeth, loquacious was the host.<BR>
Of the retinue of Mynyddawg, the unfortunate hero,<BR>
Out of three hundred but one man returned.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LX</P>
<P>From the banquet of wine and mead they hastened,<BR>
Men renowned in difficulty, careless of their lives;<BR>
In bright array around the viands they feasted together;<BR>
Wine and mead and meal they enjoyed.<BR>
From the retinue of Mynyddawg I am being ruined;<BR>
And I have lost a leader from among my true friends.<BR>
Of the body of three hundred men that hastened to<BR>
Catraeth, alas! none have returned but one alone.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXI</P>
<P>Pressent, in the combat of spears, was impetuous as a ball,<BR>
And on his horse would he be, when not at home;<BR>
Yet illusive was his aid against Gododdin.<BR>
Of wine and mead he was lavish;<BR>
He perished on the course;<BR>
And under red-stained warriors<BR>
Are the steeds of the knight, who in the morning had been bold.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXII</P>
<P>Angor, thou who scatterest the brave,<BR>
Like a serpent thou piercest the sullen ones,<BR>
Thou tramplest upon those that are clad in strong mail<BR>
In front of the army:<BR>
Like an enraged bear, guarding and assaulting,<BR>
Thou tramplest upon spears.<BR>
In the day of conflicts<BR>
In the swampy entrenchment:<BR>
Like Neddig Nar,<BR>
Who in his fury prepared<BR>
A feast for the birds,<BR>
In the tumultuous fight.<BR>
Upright thou art called from thy righteous deed,<BR>
Before the director and bulwark of the course of war,<BR>
Merin, and Madyen, it is fortunate that thou wert born.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXIII</P>
<P>It is incumbent to sing of the complete acquisition<BR>
Of the warriors, who around Catraeth made a tumultuous rout.<BR>
With confusion and blood, treading and trampling.<BR>
The strength of the drinking horn was trodden down, because it had held mead;<BR>
And as to the carnage of the interposers<BR>
Cibno does not relate, after the commencement of the action.<BR>
Since thou hast received the communion thou shalt be interred.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXIV</P>
<P>It is incumbent to sing of so much renown,<BR>
The loud noise of fire, and of thunder, and of tempest,<BR>
The noble manliness of the knight of conflict.<BR>
The ruddy reapers of war are thy desire,<BR>
Thou man of might! but the worthless wilt thou behead,<BR>
In battle the extent of the land shall hear of thee.<BR>
With thy shield upon thy shoulder thou dost incessantly cleave<BR>
With thy blade (until blood flows) like refined wine from glass vessels.<BR>
As money for drink, thou art entitled to gold.<BR>
Wine-nourished was Gwaednerth, the son of Llywri.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXV</P>
<P>It is incumbent to sing of the illustrious retinue,<BR>
That, after the fatal impulse, filled Aeron.<BR>
Their hands satisfied the mouths of the brown eagles,<BR>
And prepared food for the beasts of prey.<BR>
Of those who went to Catraeth, wearing the golden torques,<BR>
Upon the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the people,<BR>
There came not without reproach on behalf of the Brython,<BR>
To Gododdin, a man from afar better than Cynon.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXVI</P>
<P>It is incumbent to sing of so skilful a man;<BR>
joyous was he in the hall; his life was not without ambition;<BR>
Bold, all around the world would Eidol seek for melody;<BR>
For gold, and fine horses., and intoxicating mead.<BR>
Only one man of those who loved the world returned,--<BR>
Cynddilig of Aeron, the grandson of Enovant.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXVII</P>
<P>It is incumbent to sing of the illustrious retinue<BR>
That went on the message of Mynyddawg, sovereign of the people,<BR>
And the daughter of Eudav Hir, the scourge of Gwananhon,<BR>
Who was appareled in purple robes, certain to cause manglings.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXVIII</P>
<P>The warriors celebrated the praise of Nyved,<BR>
When in their presence fire was lighted.<BR>
On Tuesday, they put on their dark-brown garments;<BR>
On Wednesday, they polished their enamelled armour;<BR>
On Thursday, their destruction was certain;<BR>
On Friday, was brought carnage all around:<BR>
On Saturday, their joint I a hour did no execution;<BR>
On Sunday, their blades assumed a ruddy hue;<BR>
On Monday, was seen a pool knee-deep of blood.<BR>
Truly, the Gododdin relates that, after the toil,<BR>
Before the tents of Madawg, when he returned,<BR>
Only one man in a hundred came back.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXIX</P>
<P>Early rising in the morn<BR>
There was a conflict at the Aber in front of the course,<BR>
The pass and the knoll were in conflagration.<BR>
Like a boar didst thou lead to the mount,<BR>
There was treasure for him that was fond of it; there was room;<BR>
And there was the blood of dark-brown hawks.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXX</P>
<P>Early rising in an instant of time,<BR>
After kindling a fire at the Aber in front of the fence,<BR>
After leading his men in close array,<BR>
In front of a hundred he pierced the foremost.<BR>
It was sad that you should have caused a gushing of blood,<BR>
Like the drinking of mead in the midst of laughter.<BR>
It was brave of you to stay the little man<BR>
With the fierce and impetuous stroke of the sword.<BR>
How irresistible was he when he would kill<BR>
The foe! would that his equal could be found!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXI</P>
<P>He fell headlong down the precipice;<BR>
Song did not support his noble head:<BR>
It was a violation of privilege to kill him when bearing the branch,<BR>
It was the usage that Owain should ascend upon the course,<BR>
And extend, before the onset, the best branch,<BR>
And that he should pursue the study of meet and learned strains.<BR>
An excellent man was he, the assuager of tumult and battle,<BR>
His grasp dreaded a sword;<BR>
In his hand he bore an empty corselet.<BR>
O sovereign, dispense rewards<BR>
Out of his precious shrine.<BR>
Eidol, with frigid blood and pallid countenance,<BR>
Spreading carnage, his judgment was just and supreme,<BR>
Owner of horses<BR>
And strong trappings,<BR>
And ice-like shields;<BR>
Instantaneously he makes an onset, ascending and descending.]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXII</P>
<P>The leader of war with eagerness conducts the battle,<BR>
A mighty country loves mighty reapers.<BR>
Blood is a heavy return for new mead.<BR>
His cheeks are covered with armour all around,<BR>
There is a trampling of accoutrements - accoutrements are trampled.<BR>
He calls for death and brings desolation.<BR>
In the first onset his lances penetrate the targets,<BR>
And for light on the course, shrubs blaze on the spears.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXIII</P>
<P>A conflict on all sides destroyed thy cell;<BR>
And a hall there was to thee, where used to be poured out<BR>
Mead, sweet and ensnaring.<BR>
Gwrys make the battle clash with the dawn;<BR>
The fair gift of the tribes of the Lloegrians;<BR>
Punishment he inflicted until a reverse came.<BR>
May the dependants of Gwynedd hear of his renown.<BR>
Gwananhon will be his grave.<BR>
The lance of the conflict of Gwynedd,<BR>
The bull of the host, the oppressor of sovereigns,<BR>
Before earth pressed upon him, before he lay down;<BR>
Be the extreme boundary of Gododdin his grave!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXIV</P>
<P>An army is accustomed to be in hardships.<BR>
Mynawg, the bitter-handed leader of the forces,<BR>
He was wise, ardent, and stately:<BR>
At the social banquet he was not at all harsh.<BR>
They removed the valuable treasures that were in his possession:<BR>
And not the image of anything for the benefit of the region was left.<BR>
We are called! Like the sea is the tumult in the conflict;<BR>
Spears are mutually darting--spears all equally destructive;<BR>
Impelled are sharp weapons of iron, gashing even the ground,<BR>
And with a clang the sock falls on the pate.<BR>
A successful warrior was Fflamddur against the enemy.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXV</P>
<P>He supported war-horses and war-harness.<BR>
Drenched with gore on red-stained Catraeth<BR>
Is the shaft of the army of Dinus,<BR>
The angry dog of war upon the towering hill.<BR>
We are called to the honourable post of assault;<BR>
Most conspicuous is the iron-clad Heiddyn.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXVI</P>
<P>Mynawg of the impregnable strand of Gododdin,<BR>
Mynawg, for him our cheeks are sad:<BR>
Before the raging flame of Eiddyn he turned not aside.<BR>
He stationed men of firmness at the entrance,<BR>
He placed a thick covering in the van,<BR>
Vigorously he descended upon the furious foe;<BR>
He caused devastation and sustained great weight.<BR>
Of the retinue of Mynyddawg there escaped none<BR>
Except one frail weapon, tottering every way.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXVII</P>
<P>Since the loss of Moryed there was no shield-bearer,<BR>
To support the strand, or to set the ground on fire;<BR>
Firmly did he grasp in his hand a blue blade,<BR>
A shaft ponderous as a chief priest's crozier;<BR>
He rode a gray stately-headed courser,<BR>
And behind his blade there was a dreadful fall of slaughter;<BR>
When overpowered, he did not run away from the battle.<BR>
He poured out to us sparkling mead, sweet and ensnaring.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXVIII</P>
<P>I beheld the array from the high land of Adoyn;<BR>
They descended with the sacrifice for the conflagration;<BR>
I saw what was usual, a continual running to the town,<BR>
And the men of Nwythyon entirely lost;<BR>
I saw men in complete order approaching with a shout;<BR>
And the heads of Dyvynwal and Breych, ravens devoured them.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXIX</P>
<P>Blessed conqueror, of temper mild, the bone of the people,<BR>
With his blue streamer displayed, while the foes range the sea.<BR>
Brave is he on the waters, most numerous his host;<BR>
With a bold breast and loud shout they pierced him.<BR>
It was his custom to make a descent before nine armaments,<BR>
In the face of blood, of the country, and of the tribes.<BR>
I love the victor's throne which was for harmonious strains,<BR>
Cynddilig of Aeron, the lion's whelp!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXX</P>
<P>I could wish to have been the first to fall in Catraeth,<BR>
As the price of mead in the hall, and the beverage of wine;<BR>
I could wish to have been pierced by the blade,<BR>
Ere he was slain on the green plain of Uffin.<BR>
I loved the son of renown, who caused blood to flow,<BR>
And made his sword descend upon the violent.<BR>
Can a tale of valour before Gododdin be related,<BR>
In which the son of Ceidiaw has not his fame as a man of war?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXI</P>
<P>It is sad for me, after our toil,<BR>
To suffer the pang of death through indiscretion;<BR>
And doubly grievous and sad for me to see<BR>
Our men falling from head to foot,<BR>
With a long sigh and with reproaches.<BR>
After the strenuous warriors of our native land and country,<BR>
Ruvawn and Gwgawn, Gwiawn and Gwlyged,<BR>
Men most gallant at their posts, valiant in difficulties,<BR>
May their souls, now after the conflict,<BR>
Be received into the country of heaven, the abode of tranquillity.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXII</P>
<P>He repelled the chain through a pool of blood,<BR>
He slaughtered like a hero such as asked no quarter.<BR>
With a sling and a spear; he flung off his glass goblet<BR>
Of mead; in the presence of sovereigns he overthrew an army.<BR>
His counsel prevailed wherever he spoke.<BR>
A multitude that had no pity would not be allowed<BR>
Before the onset of his battle-axes and sword;<BR>
Sharpened they were; and his sounding blade was carefully watched.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXIII</P>
<P>A supply of an army,<BR>
A supply of lances,<BR>
And a host in the vanguard,<BR>
With a menacing front:<BR>
In the day of strenuous exertion,<BR>
In the eager conflict,<BR>
They displayed their valour.<BR>
After intoxication,<BR>
And the drinking of mead,<BR>
There was no deliverance.<BR>
They watched us<BR>
For a while;<BR>
When it shall be related how the attack<BR>
Of horses and men was repelled, it will be pronounced the decree of fate.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXIV</P>
<P>Why should so much anxiety come to me?<BR>
I am anxious about the maid--<BR>
The maid that is in Arddeg.<BR>
There is a precipitate running,<BR>
And lamentation along the course.<BR>
Affectionately have I deplored,<BR>
Deeply have I loved,<BR>
The illustrious dweller of the wood!<BR>
And the men of Argoed.<BR>
Woe to those who are accustomed<BR>
To be marshalled for battle!<BR>
He pressed hard upon the hostile force, for the benefit of chieftains,<BR>
Through rough woods,<BR>
And dammed-up waters,<BR>
To the festivities,<BR>
At which they caroused together: he conducted us to a bright fire,<BR>
And to a white and fresh hide.<BR>
Gereint from the south raised a shout;<BR>
A brilliant gleam reflected on the pierced shield.<BR>
Of the lord of the spear, a gentle lord;<BR>
Attached to the glory of the sea.<BR>
Posterity will accomplish<BR>
What Gereint would have done.<BR>
Generous and resolute wert thou!</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXV</P>
<P>Instantaneously his fame is wafted on high,<BR>
Irresistible was Angor in the conflict,<BR>
Unflinching eagle of the forward heroes;<BR>
He bore the toil, brilliant was his zeal;<BR>
He outstripped fleetest horses in war;<BR>
But he was mild when the wine from the goblet flowed.<BR>
Before the new mead, and his cheek became pale,<BR>
He was a man of the banquet over delicious mead from the bowl.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXVI</P>
<P>With slaughter was every region filled;<BR>
His courage was like a fetter:<BR>
The front of his shield was pierced.<BR>
Disagreeable is the delay of the wrathful<BR>
To defend Rywoniawg.<BR>
The second time they raised the shout, and were crushed<BR>
By the war-horses with gory trappings.<BR>
An immovable army will his warlike nobles form,<BR>
And the field was reddened when he was greatly enraged.<BR>
Severe in the conflict, with a blade he slaughtered;<BR>
Sad news from the battle he brought;<BR>
And a New-year's song he composed.<BR>
Adan, the son of Ervai, there was pierced,<BR>
Adan! the haughty boar, was pierced,<BR>
One damsel, a maid, and a hero.<BR>
And when he was only a youth he had the rights of a king.<BR>
Being lord of Gwyndyd, of the blood of Glyd Gwaredawg.<BR>
Ere the turf was laid on the gentle face<BR>
Of the generous dead, now undisturbed,<BR>
He was celebrated for fame and generosity.<BR>
This is the grave of Garthwys Hir from the land of Rywoniawg.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXVII</P>
<P>The coat of Dinogad was of various colours,<BR>
And made of the speckled skins of young wolves.<BR>
'Whistle! whistle!' the juggling sound!<BR>
I fain would dispraise it; it is dispraised by eight slaves.<BR>
When thy father went out to hunt,<BR>
With his pole on his shoulder, and his provisions in his hand,<BR>
He would call to his dogs of equal size, -<BR>
'Catch it! catch it! seize it! seize it!'<BR>
He would kill a fish in his coracle,<BR>
As a noble lion kills (his prey).<BR>
When thy father went up to the mountain<BR>
He would bring back the head of a roebuck, the head of a wild boar, the head of a stag,<BR>
The head of a spotted moor-hen from the mountain,<BR>
The head of a fish from the falls of Derwennyd.<BR>
As many as thy father could reach with his flesh-hook,<BR>
Of wild boars, lions, and foxes.<BR>
None would escape except those that were too nimble.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXVIII</P>
<P>If distress were to happen to me through extortion,<BR>
There would not come, there would not be to me anything more calamitous.<BR>
No man has been nursed in a hall who could be braver<BR>
Than he, or steadier in battle.<BR>
And on the ford of Penclwyd his horses were the best;<BR>
Far-spread was his fame, compact his armour;<BR>
And before the long grass covered him beneath the sod,<BR>
He, the only son of Ffervarch, poured out the horns of mead.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">LXXXIX</P>
<P>I saw the array from the headland of Adoyn,<BR>
Carrying the sacrifice to the conflagration;<BR>
I saw the two who from their station quickly fell;<BR>
By the commands of Nwython greatly were they afflicted.<BR>
I saw the men, who made a great breach, with the dawn at Adoyn;<BR>
And the head of Dyvynwal Vych, ravens devoured it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XC</P>
<P>Gododdin, in respect of thee will I demand<BR>
In the presence of a hundred that are named with deeds of valour.<BR>
And of Gwarchan, the son of Dwywei of gallant bravery,<BR>
Let it be forcibly seized in one region.<BR>
Since the stabbing of the delight of the bulwark of battle,<BR>
Since earth has gone upon Aneurin,<BR>
My cry has not been separated from Gododdin.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XCI</P>
<P>Echo speaks of the formidable and dragon-like weapons,<BR>
And of the fair game which was played in front of the unclaimed course of Gododdin.<BR>
He brought a supply of wine into the tents of the natives,<BR>
In the season of the storm, when there were vessels on the sea,<BR>
When there was a host on the sea, a well-nourished host.<BR>
A splendid troop of warriors, successful against a myriad of men,<BR>
Is coming from Dindywydd n Dyvnwydd.<BR>
Before Doleu in battle, worn out were their shields, and battered their helmets.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XCII</P>
<P>With slaughter was every region filled.<BR>
His courage was like a fetter;<BR>
The front of his shield was pierced.<BR>
Disagreeable is the delay of the brave<BR>
To defend Rywyniawg.<BR>
The second time they reposed, and were crushed<BR>
By the war-horses with gory trappings.<BR>
An immovable army will his warlike and brave nobles form,<BR>
When they are greatly affronted.<BR>
Severe in the conflict with blades he slaughtered;<BR>
Sad news from the battle he brought;<BR>
And an hundred New-years' songs he composed.<BR>
Adan, the son of Urvai, was pierced;<BR>
Adan, the haughty boar, was pierced;<BR>
One damsel, a maid, and a hero.<BR>
And when he was only a youth he had the rights of a king,<BR>
Lord of Gwyndyd, of the blood of Cilydd Gwaredawg<BR>
Ere the turf was laid on the face of the generous dead,<BR>
Wisely collected were his treasure, praise, and high-sounding fame.<BR>
The grave of Gorthyn Hir from the highlands of Rywynawg.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XCIII</P>
<P>For the piercing of the skilful and most learned man,<BR>
For the fair corpse which fell prostrate on the ground,<BR>
Thrice six persons judged the atrocious deed early in the morning;<BR>
And Morien lifted up his ancient lance,<BR>
And, shouting, unbent his tight-drawn bow<BR>
Towards the Gwyr, and the Gwyddyl, and Prydein.<BR>
Towards the lovely, slender, bloodstained body<BR>
The sigh of Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">XCIV</P>
<P>For the afflicting of the skilful and most learned man,<BR>
There was grief and sorrow, when he fell prostrate on the ground;<BR>
His banner showed his rank, and was borne by a man at his side.<BR>
A tumultuous scene was beheld in Eiddyn, and on the battle-field.<BR>
The grasp of his hand prevailed<BR>
Over the Gynt, and the Gwyddyl, and Pryden,<BR>
He who meddles with the mane of a wolf without a club in his hand,<BR>
He must naturally have a brave disposition under his cloak.<BR>
The sigh of Gwenabwy, the son of Gwen.</P></BODY>
