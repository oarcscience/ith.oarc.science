<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PREFACE TO VOL. II</H1>
<P>IT seems to have been customary in ancient Ireland to precede by shorter stories the recital of the Great Tain, the central story of the Irish Heroic Age. A list of fourteen of these "lesser Tains," three of which are lost, is given in Miss Hull's "Cuchullin Saga"; those preserved are the Tain bo Aingen, Dartada, Flidais, Fraich, Munad, Regamon, Regamna, Ros, Ruanadh, Sailin, and Ere. Of these, five only have been edited, viz. the Tain bo Dartada, Flidais, Fraich, Regamon, and Regamna; all these five are given in this volume.</P>
<P>The last four tales are all short, and perhaps are more truly "preludes" (<I>remscela</I>) than the Tain bo Fraich, which has indeed enough of interest in itself to make it an independent tale, and is as long as the four put together. All the five tales have been rendered into verse, with a prose literal translation opposite to the verse rendering, for reasons already given in the preface to the first volume. A short introduction, describing the manuscript authority, is prefixed to each; they all seem to go back in date to the best literary period, but appear to have been at any rate put into their present form later than the Great Tain, in order to lead up to it. A possible exception to this may be found at the end of the Tain bo Flidais, which seems to give a different account of the end of the war of Cualgne, and to claim that Cuchulain was defeated, and that Connaught gained his land for its allies. It may be mentioned that the last four tales are expressly stated in the text to be "<I>remscela</I>" to the Great Tain.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION IN VERSE</H1><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>When to an Irish court of old<BR>
Came men, who flocked from near and far<BR>
To hear the ancient tale that told<BR>
Cuchulain's deeds in Cualgne's War;</P>
<P>Oft, ere that famous tale began,<BR>
Before their chiefest bard they hail,<BR>
Amid the throng some lesser man<BR>
Arose, to tell a lighter tale;</P>
<P>He'd fell how Maev and Ailill planned<BR>
Their mighty hosts might best be fed,<BR>
When they towards the Cualgne land<BR>
All Irelands swarming armies led;</P>
<P>How Maev the youthful princes sent<BR>
To harry warlike Regamon,<BR>
How they, who trembling, from her went,<BR>
His daughters and his cattle won;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>{p. viii}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>How Ailill's guile gained Darla's cows,<BR>
How vengeful fairies marked that deed;<BR>
How Fergus won his royal spouse<BR>
Whose kine all Ireland's hosts could feed;</P>
<P>How, in a form grotesque and weird,<BR>
Cuchulain found a Power Divine;<BR>
Or how in shapes of beasts appeared<BR>
The Magic Men, who kept the Swine;</P>
<P>Or how the rowan's guardian snake<BR>
Was roused by order of the king;<BR>
Or how, from out the water, Fraech<BR>
To Finnabar restored her ring.</P>
<P>And though, in greater tales, they chose<BR>
Speech mired with song, men's hearts to sway,<BR>
Such themes as these they told in prose,<BR>
Like speakers at the "Feis" to-day.</P>
<P>To men who spake the Irish tongue<BR>
That form of Prose was pleasing well,<BR>
While other lands in ballads sung<BR>
Such tales as these have loved to tell:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I><P>{p. ix}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>So we, who now in English dress<BR>
These Irish tales would fain<BR>
And seek their spirit to express,<BR>
Have set them down in ballad verse;</P>
<P>And, though to Celts the form be strange,<BR>
Seek not too much the change to blame;<BR>
'Tis but the form alone we change;<BR>
The sense, the spirit rest the same.</P></DIR>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">TAIN BO FRAICH</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>THE Tain bo Fraich, the Driving of the Cattle of Fraech, has apparently only one version; the different manuscripts which contain it differing in very small points; most of which seem to be due to scribal errors.</P>
<P>Practically the tale consists of two quite separate parts. The first, the longer portion, gives the adventures of Fraech at the court of Ailill and Maev of Connaught, his courtship of their daughter, Finnabar, and closes with a promised betrothal. The second part is an account of an expedition undertaken by Fraech to the Alps "in the north of the land of the Long Beards," to recover stolen cattle, as well as his wife," who is stated by O'Beirne Crowe, on the authority of the "Courtship of Trebland" in the Book of Fermoy, to have been Trebland, a semi-deity, like Fraech himself. Except that Fraech is the chief actor in both parts, and that there is one short reference at the end of the second part to the fact that Fraech did, as he had promised in the first part, join Ailill and Maev upon the War of Cualnge, there is no connection between the two stories. But the difference between the two parts is not only in the subject-matter; the difference in the style is even yet more apparent. The first part has, I think, the most complicated plot of any Irish romance, it abounds in brilliant descriptions, and, although the original is in prose, it is, in feeling, highly poetic. The second part resembles in its simplicity and rapid action the other "fore tales" or preludes to the War of Cualnge contained in this volume, and is of a style represented in English by the narrative ballad.</P>
<P>In spite of the various characters of the two parts, the story seems to have been regarded as one in all the manuscripts which contain it; and the question how these two romances came to be regarded as one story becomes interesting. The natural hypothesis would be that the last part was the original version, which was in. its earlier part re-written by a man of genius, possibly drawing his plot from some brief statement that Finnabar was promised to Fraech in return for the help that he and his recovered cattle could give in the Great War; but a difficulty, which prevents us from</P>
<P>{p. 4}</P>
<P>regarding the second part as an original legend, at once comes in. The second part of the story happens to contain so many references to nations outside Ireland that its date can be pretty well fixed. Fraech and his companions go, over the sea from Ulster, <I>i.e.</I> to Scotland; then through "north Saxon-land" to the sea of Icht (<I>i.e.</I> the sea of Wight or the English Channel); then to the Alps in the north of the land of the Long-Beards, or Lombards. The Long-Beards do not appear in Italy until the end of the sixth century; the suggestion of North Saxon-Land reaching down to the sea of Wight suggests that there was then a South Saxon-Land, familiar to an Irish writer, dating this part of the story as before the end of the eighth century, when both Saxons and Long-Beards were overcome by Charlemagne. The second part of the story is, then, no original legend, but belongs to the seventh or eighth century, or the classical period; and it looks as if there were two writers, one of whom, like the author of the Egerton version of Etain, embellished the love-story part of the original legend, leaving the end alone, while another author wrote an account of the legendary journey of the demi-god Fraech in search for his stolen cattle, adding the geographical and historical knowledge of his time. The whole was then put together, like the two parts of the Etain story; the difference between the two stories in the matter of the wife does not seem to have troubled the compilers.</P>
<P>The oldest manuscript authority for the Tain bo Fraich is the Book of Leinster, written before 1150. There are at least two other manuscript authorities, one; in Egerton, 1782 (published by Professor Kuno Meyer in the <I>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Celt. Philologie</I>, 1902); the other is in MS. XL., Advocates' Library, Edinburgh (published in the Revue Celtique, Vol. XXIV.). Professor Meyer has kindly allowed me to copy his comparison of these manuscripts and his revision of O'Beirne Crowe's translation of the Book of Leinster text. The text of the literal translation given here follows, however, in the main O'Beirne Crowe's translation, which is in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy for 1870; a few insertions are made from the other MSS.; when so made the insertion is indicated by a note.</P>
<P>For those who may be interested in the subsequent history of Fraech, it may be mentioned that he was one of the first of the Connaught champions to be slain by Cuchulain in the war of Cualnge; see Miss Faraday's translation (Grimm Library, page 35).</P>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">LITERAL TRANSLATION</H4>
<P>FRAECH, son of Idath of the men of Connaught, a son he to Befind from the <I>Sid&eacute;</I>: a sister she to Boand. He is the hero who is the most beautiful that was of the men of Eriu and of Alba, but he was not long-lived. His mother gave him twelve cows out of the Sid (the fairy mound), they are white-eared. He had a good housekeeping till the end of eight years without the taking of a wife. Fifty sons of kings, this was the number of his household, co-aged, co-similar to him all between form and instruction. Findabair, daughter of Ailill and Medb, loves him for the great stories about him. It is declared to him at his house. Eriu and Alba were full of his renown and the stories about him.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>To Fraech[1] was Idath[2] father,<BR>
A Connaught man was he:<BR>
And well we know his mother<BR>
Who dwells among the Shee;[3]<BR>
Befind they call her, sister<BR>
To Boand,[4] the Fairy Queen;<BR>
And Alba ne'er, nor Erin,<BR>
Such grace as Fraech's hath seen.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet wondrous though that hero's grace,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{10} His fairy lineage high,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For years but few his lovely face<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was seen by human eye.</P>
<P>Fraech had twelve of white-eared fairy-cattle,<BR>
'Twas his mother those cattle who gave:<BR>
For eight years in his home he dwelt wifeless,<BR>
And the state of his household was brave;<BR>
Fifty princes, whose age, and whose rearing,<BR>
And whose forms were as his, with him played;<BR>
And his glory filled Alba and Erin<BR>
{20} Till it came to the ears of a maid:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Maev and Ailill's[5] lovely child,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Findabar, 'twas said,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By tales of Fraech to love beguiled,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Fraech in love would wed.</P></DIR>

<P>After this going to a dialogue with the maiden occurred to him; he discussed that matter with his people.</P>
<P>"Let there be a message then sent to thy mother's sister, so that a portion of wondrous robing and of gifts from the <I>Sid&eacute;</I> (fairy folk) be given thee from her." He goes accordingly to the sister, that is to Boand, till he was in Mag Breg, and he carried away fifty dark-blue cloaks, and each of them was like the back of a black chafer,[1] and four black-grey, rings on each cloak, and a brooch of red gold on each cloak, and pale white tunics with loop-animals of gold around them. And fifty silver shields with edges, and a candle of a king's-house in the hand of them (the men), and fifty studs of <I>findruine</I>[2] on each of them (the lances), fifty knobs of thoroughly burned gold on each of them; points (<I>i.e.</I> butt-ends) of carbuncle under them beneath, and their point of precious stones. They used to light the night as if they were the sun's rays.</P>
<P>And there were fifty gold-hilted swords with them, and a soft-grey<BR>
mare under the seat of each man, and bits of gold to them;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Book of Leinster gives "fifty blue cloaks, each like <I>findruine</I> of art."</P>

<P>Now the news of the love of that maid to Fraech, at his home where he dwelt, was brought,<BR>
And he called his folk, and with all he spoke, and for speech with the maid he sought:<BR>
And they counselled him thus: "Let a message from thee be sent to thy fairy kin<BR>
To entreat their aid when we seek that maid; a boon we may chance to win:<BR>
For the wondrous robes of the fairy land, and for gifts from the fairies plead;<BR>
{30} And sure thy mother's sister's hand will give to thee all thy need."</P>
<P>To Mag Breg,[1] where his mother's sister dwelt, to Boand he away hath gone,<BR>
And she gave to him mantles of dark black-blue, like a beetle's back they shone:<BR>
Four dark-grey rings in each cloak she gave were sewn, and a brooch shone, bright<BR>
With the good red gold in each mantle's fold; she gave tunics pale and white,<BR>
And the tunics were bordered with golden loops, that forms as of beasts displayed;<BR>
And a fifty she added of well-rimmed shields, that of silver white were made.</P>
<P>Then away they rode, in each hero's hand was a torch for a kingly hall,<BR>
For studs of bronze, and of well-burned gold, shone bright on the spears of all;<BR>
On carbuncle sockets the spears were set, their points with jewels blazed;<BR>
{40} And they lit the night, as with fair sunlight, as men on their glory gazed.</P>
<P>By each of the fifty heroes' side was a sword with a hilt of gold;<BR>
And a soft-grey mare was for each to ride, with a golden curb controlled;</P></DIR>

Fifty caparisons[1] of purple with threads of silver out of them, with buckles of gold and silver and with head-animals (<I>i.e.</I> spiral ornaments). Fifty whips of findruine, with a golden hook on the end of each of them. And seven chase-hounds in chains of silver, and an apple of gold between each of them. Greaves of bronze about them, by no means was there any colour which was not on the hounds.</P>
<P>Seven trumpeters with them with golden and silver trumpets with many coloured garments, with golden fairy-yellow heads of hair, with shining tunics.

<P>At each horse's throat was a silver plate, and in front of that plate was swung,<BR>
With a tinkling sound to the horse's tread, a bell with a golden tongue.<BR>
on each steed was a housing of purple hide, with threads of silver laced,<BR>
And with spiral stitch of the silver threads the heads of beasts were traced,<BR>
And each housing was buckled with silver and gold: of <I>findruine</I>[1] was made the whip<BR>

As if greaves for defence they had worn,<BR>
Every hue man hath seen, or hath fancied,<BR>

<P>Seven trumpeters strode on the road before, with colour their cloaks were bright,<BR>

{60} And their hair, soft and yellow, like fairy threads, shone golden their shoulders round.</P>
<P>Three jesters marched in the van, their-crowns were of silver, by gilt concealed,<BR>

<P>The watchman sees them from the dun when they had come into the plain of Cruachan. "A multitude I see," he says, "(come) towards the dun in their numbers. Since Ailill and Maev assumed sovereignty there came not to them before, and there shall not come to them, a multitude, which is more beautiful, or which is more splendid. It is the same with me that it were in a vat of wine my head should be, with the breeze that goes over them.</P>

<P>They alight in front of the <I>dun</I>. They tent their steeds, and they loose the chase-hounds. They (the hounds) chase the seven deer to Rath-Cruachan, and seven foxes, and seven hares, and seven wild boars, until the youths kill them in the lawn of the <I>dun</I>. After that the chase-hounds dart a leap into Brei; they catch seven otters. They brought them to the elevation in front of the chief rath. They (Fraech and his suite) sit down there.</P>
<P>A message comes from the king for a parley with them. It is asked whence they came, they name themselves according to their true names, "Fraech, son of Idath this," say they. The steward tells it to the king and queen. "Welcome to them," say Ailill and Maev; "It is a noble youth who is there," says Ailill, "let him come into the <I>Liss</I> (outer court)." The fourth of the house is allotted to them. This was the array of the house, a seven fold order in it; seven apartments from fire to side-wall in the house all round. A rail (or front) of bronze to each apartment; a partitioning of red yew under variegated planing all.</P>

<P>To the fort came the youths, from their steeds they leapt, for the steeds and the stabling cared,<BR>
And they loosed the hounds that in leash they kept, for the hunt were the hounds prepared;<BR>
Seven deer, seven foxes and hares, they chased to the dun on Croghan's plain,<BR>
Seven boars they drave, on the lawn in haste the game by the youths was slain:<BR>
With a bound they dashed into Bree, whose flood by the lawns of Croghan flows;<BR>
Seven otters they caught in its stream, and brought to a hill where the gateway rose.</P>
<P>'Twas there that Fraech and the princes sat at the castle-gate to rest,<BR>
And the steward of Croghan with Fraech would speak, for such was the king's behest:<BR>
Of his birth it was asked, and the men he led all truth to the herald spake:<BR>
{100} "It is Idath's son who is here," they said, and they gave him the name of Fraech.<BR>
To Ailill and Maev went the steward back of the stranger's name to tell;<BR>
"Give him welcome," said they: "Of a noble race is that youth, and I know it well;<BR>
Let him enter the court of our house," said the king, the gateway they opened wide;<BR>
And the fourth of the palace they gave to Fraech, that there might his youths abide.</P><DIR>

Seven great chambers were ranged it round;<BR>

<P>"Welcome to you," say Ailill and Medb. "It is that we have come for," says Fraech. "It shall not be a journey for boasting[1] this," says Medb, and Ailill and Medb arrange the chess-board after that. Fraech then takes to the playing of chess with a man of their (?) people.</P>
<P>It was a beauty of a chess-board. A board of <I>findruine</I> in it with four ears[2] and edges of gold. A candle of precious stones at illuminating for them. Gold and silver the figures that were upon the table. "Prepare ye food for the warriors," said Ailill. "Not it is my desire," said Medb, but to go to the chess yonder against Fraech." "Get to it, I am pleased," said Ailill, and they play the chess then, and Fraech.</P>
<P>His people were meanwhile at cooking the wild animals. "Let thy harpers play for us," says Ailill to Fraech. "Let them play indeed!" says Fraech. A harp-bag[3] of the skins of otters about them with their adornment of ruby (<I>or</I> coral), beneath their adornment of gold and silver.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This is the rendering in the Yellow Book of Lecan, considered by Meyer to be the true reading. The Book of Leinster text gives "aig-baig," a word of doubtful meaning. The Eg. MS. has also a doubtful word.</P>

<P>By the queen and the king they were welcome made, the strangers they turned to greet;<BR>
{140} And their courtesy graciously Fraech repaid: "'Twas thus we had hoped to meet."<BR>
"Not for boasting to-day are ye come!" said Maev; the men for the chess she set:<BR>
And a lord of the court in the chess-man sport by Fraech in a match was met.<BR>
'Twas a marvellous board of <I>findruine</I> fair was prepared, when they played that game,<BR>
Four handles, and edges of gold it had, nor needed they candles' flame;<BR>
For the jewels that blazed at the chess-board's side, a light, as from lamps, would yield;<BR>
And of silver and gold were the soldiers made, who engaged on that mimic field.</P>
<P>"Get ye food for the chiefs!" said the king; said Maev, "Not yet, 'tis my will to stay,<BR>
To sit with the strangers, and here with Fraech in a match at the chess to play!"<BR>
"Let thy game be played!" said Ailill then, "for it pleaseth me none the less:"<BR>
{150} And Queen Maev and Fraech at the chess-board sate, and they played at the game of chess.</P>
<P>Now his men, as they played, the wild beasts late caught were cooking, they thought to feed;<BR>
And said Ailill to Fraech, "Shall thy harpmen play?" "Let them play," said Fraech, "indeed:"<BR>
Now those harpers were wondrous men, by their sides they had sacks of the otter's skin,<BR>
And about their bodies the sacks were tied, and they carried their harps within,<BR>
With stitches of silver and golden thread each case for a harp was sewed;<BR>
And, beneath the embroidery gleaming red, the shimmer of rubies showed!</P></DIR>

<P>The skin of a roe about them in the middle, it was as white as snow; black-grey eyes in their centre. Cloaks of linen as white as the tunic of a swan around these ties.[1] Harps of gold and silver and bronze, with figures of serpents and birds, and hounds of gold and silver: as they moved those strings those figures used to run about the men all round.</P>
<P>They play for them then so that twelve of the people[2] of Ailill and Medb die with weeping and sadness.</P>
<P>Gentle and melodious were the triad, and they were the Chants of Uaithne[3] (Child-birth). The illustrious triad are three brothers, namely <I>Gol-traiges</I> (Sorrow-strain), and <I>Gen-traiges</I> (Joy-strain), and <I>Suan-traiges</I> (Sleep-strain).

<P>At every one of the harpers' waists was girded the hide of a roe,<BR>
And black-grey spots in its midst were placed, but the hide was as white as snow;<BR>
And round each of the three of them waved a cloak, as white as the wild swan's wings:<BR>
{160} Gold, silver, and bronze were the harps they woke; and still, as they touched the strings,<BR>
The serpents, the birds, and the hounds on the harps took life at the harps' sweet sound,<BR>
And those figures of gold round the harpmen rose, and floated in music round.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Then they played, sweet and sad was the playing,<BR>
Twelve of Ailill's men died, as they heard;<BR>
It was Boand[1] who foretold them that slaying,<BR>

<P>it is from the music which Uaithne, the Dagda's harp, played that the three are named. The time the woman was at the bearing of children it had a cry of sorrow with the soreness of the pangs at first: it was smile and joy it played in the middle for the pleasure of bringing forth the two sons: it was a sleep of soothingness played the last son, on account of the heaviness of the birth, so that it is from him that the third of the music has been named.</P>
<P>Boand awoke afterwards out of the sleep. "I accept," she says, "thy three sons O Uaithne of full ardour, since there is <I>Suan-traide</I> and <I>Gen-traide</I>, and <I>Gol-traide</I> on cows and women who shall fall by Medb and Ailill,</P>

<P>They cease from playing after that in the palace: "It is stately it has come," says Fergus. "Divide ye to us," says Fraech to his people, "the food, bring ye it into the house." Lothur went on the floor of the house: he divides to them the food. On his haunches he used to divide each joint with his sword, and he used not to touch the food part: since he commenced dividing, he never hacked the meat beneath his hand.</P>
<P>They were three days and three nights at the playing of the chess on account of the abundance of the precious stones in the household of Fraech. After that Fraech addressed Medb. "It is well I have played against thee (<I>i.e.</I> have beaten thee)," he says, "I take not away thy stake from the chess-board that there be not a decay of hospitality for thee in it."</P>

<P>Said Fraech, "The food divide ye!<BR>

<P>Three days at the chess had they played; three nights, as they sat at the game, had gone:<BR>

<P>"Since I have been in this<I> dun </I>this is the day which I deem longest in it ever," says Medb. "This is reasonable," says Fraech, "they are three days and three nights in it." At this Medb starts up. It was a shame with her that the warriors were without food. She goes to Ailill: she tells it to him. "A great deed we have done," said she, "the stranger men who have come to us to be without food." "Dearer to thee is playing of the chess," says Ailill. "It hinders not the distribution to his suite throughout the house. They have been three days and three nights in it but that we perceived not the night with the white light of the precious stones in the house." "Tell them," says Ailill, "to cease from the lamenting until distribution is made to them." Distribution is then made to them, and things were pleasing to them, and they stayed three days and three nights in it after that over the feasting.</P>
<P>It is after that Fraech was called into the house of conversation, and it is asked of him what brought him. "A visit with you," said he, "is pleasing to me." "Your company is indeed not displeasing with the household," said Ailill, "your addition is better than your diminution."</P>

<P>"For no lengthier day have I sat in such play," said Maev, "since I here first came."<BR>
"And well may the day have seemed long," said Fraech, "for three days and three nights was the game!"<BR>
Then up started Maev, and in shame she blushed that the chiefs she had failed to feed;<BR>
{230} To her husband, King Ailill, in wrath she rushed: "We have both done a goodly deed!<BR>
For none from our stores hath a banquet brought for the youths who are strangers here!"<BR>
And said Ailill, "In truth for the play was thy thought, and to thee was the chess more dear."<BR>
"We knew not that darkness had come," said Maev, "'tis not chess thou should'st thus condemn;<BR>
Though the day had gone, yet the daylight shone from the heart of each sparkling gem;<BR>
Though the game we played, all could meal have made, had men brought of the night advice,<BR>
But the hours sped away, and the night and the day have approached and have fled from us thrice!"<BR>
"Give command," said the king, "that those wailing chants, till we give them their food, be stilled."<BR>
And food to the hands of each they gave, and all with the meat were filled;<BR>
And all things merrily went, for long the men with a feast were fed,<BR>
{240} For, as feasting they sat, thrice rose the day, thrice night above earth was spread.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>They brought Fraech, when that banquet was ended,<BR>
To the House of Debate, which was near,<BR>
And they asked of his errand: "In friendship,<BR>
For a visit," said Fraech, "am I here!"<BR>
"And 'twas joy that we felt, when receiving<BR>
This your host," said the king, "ye have brought<BR>
Much of pleasure to all, and with grieving,<BR>
When ye go, shall your presence be sought!"</P></DIR>

<P>"We shall stay here then," says Fraech, "another week." They stay after that till the end of a fortnight in the dun, and they have a hunt every single day towards the dun. The men of Connaught used to come to view them.</P>
<P>It was a trouble with Fraech not to have a conversation with the daughter: for that was the profit that had brought him. A certain day he starts up at the end of night for washing to the stream. It is the time she had gone and her maid for washing. He takes her hand. "Stay for my conversing," he says; "it is thou I have come for." "I am delighted truly," says the daughter; "if I were to come, I could do nothing for thee." "Query, wouldst thou elope with me?" he says.</P>

<P>Fraech perceived that matter. He sees something, the salmon leaped to meet it, and caught it in his mouth. He (Fraech) gives a bound to it, and he catches its jole, and he goes to land, and he brings it to a lonely[1] spot on the brink of the river. He proceeds to come out of the water then. "Do not come," says Ailill, "until thou shalt bring me a branch of the rowan-tree yonder, which is on the brink of the river: beautiful I deem its berries." He then goes away, and breaks a branch off the trees and brings it on his back over the water. The remark of Find-abair was: "Is it not beautiful he looks?" Exceedingly beautiful she thought it to see Fraech over a black pool: the body of great whiteness, and the hair of great loveliness, the face of great beauty, the eye of great greyness; and he a soft youth without fault, without blemish, with a below-narrow, above-broad face;</P>

<P>And Fraech saw the gem as it brightly flashed,<BR>
And a salmon rose high, at the light it dashed,<BR>
And, as back in the stream with the ring he splashed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fish went Fraech with a spring:<BR>
By its jole was the salmon secured, and thrown<BR>
To a nook in the bank, that by few was known;<BR>
And unnoticed he threw it, to none was it shown<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{360} As it fell to the earth, with the ring.</P>
<P>And now Fraech from the stream would be going:<BR>
But, "Come not," said the king, "to us yet:<BR>
Bring a branch from yon rowan-tree, showing<BR>
Its fair berries, with water-drops wet."</P>
<P>Then Fraech, swimming away through the water,<BR>
Brake a branch from the dread rowan-tree,<BR>
And a sigh came from Ailill's fair daughter;<BR>
"Ah! how lovely he seemeth," said she.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Fair she found him, swimming<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{370} Through that pool so black<BR>
Brightly gleamed the berries,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound athwart his back.</P>
<P>White and smooth his body,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright his glorious hair;<BR>
Eyes of perfect greyness,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face of men most fair:</P>
<P>Soft his skin, no blemish,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fault, nor spot it flawed;<BR>
Small his chin, and steady,<BR>

<P>and he straight, blemishless; the branch with the red berries between the throat and the white face. It is what Find-abair used to say, that by no means had she seen anything that could come up to him half or third for beauty.</P>
<P>After that he throws the branches to them out of the water. "The berries are stately and beautiful, bring us an addition of them." He goes off again until he was in the middle of the water. The serpent catches him out of the water. "Let a sword come to me from you," he says; and there was not on the land a man who would dare to give it to him through fear of Ailill and Medb. After that Find-abair strips off her clothes, and gives a leap into the water with the sword. Her father lets fly a five-pronged spear at her from above, a shot's throw, so that it passes through her two tresses, and that Fraech caught the spear in his hand. He shoots the spear into the land up, and the monster in his side. He lets it fly with a charge of the methods of playing of championship, so that it goes through the purple robe and through the tunic (? shirt) that was about Ailill.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Findabar would cry:<BR>
"Ne'er was half such beauty,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught its third came nigh!"</P></DIR>

<P>To the bank he swam, and to Ailill was thrown, with its berries, the tree's torn limb:<BR>
{390} "Ah! how heavy and fair have those clusters grown; bring us more," and he turned to swim;<BR>
The mid-current was reached, but the dragon was roused that was guard to that rowan-tree;<BR>
And it rose from the river, on Fraech it rushed: "Throw a sword from the bank!" cried he.<BR>
And no man on the bank gave the sword: they were kept by their fear of the queen and the king;<BR>
But her clothes from her Finnabar stripped, and she leapt in the river his sword to bring.<BR>
And the king from above hurled his five-barbed spear; the full length of a shot it sped:<BR>
At his daughter it flew, and its edge shore through two tresses that crowned her head:<BR>
And Fraech in his hand caught the spear as it fell, and backward its point he turned.<BR>
And again to the land was the spear launched well: 'twas a feat from the champions learned.<BR>
Though the beast bit his side as that spear was cast, yet fiercely the dart was flung,<BR>
{400} Through the purple robe of the king it passed, through the tunic that next him clung!</P></DIR>

<P>At this the youths who were about Ailill rise to him. Find-abair goes out of the water and leaves the sword in Fraech's hand, and he cuts the head off the monster, so that it was on its side, and he brought the monster with him to land. It is from it is Dub-lind Fraech in Brei, in the lands of the men of Connaught. Ailill and Medb go to their <I>dun</I> afterwards.</P>
<P>"A great deed is what we have done," says Medb. "We repent," says Ailill, "of what we have done to the man; the daughter however," he says, "her lips shall perish [common metaphor for death] to-morrow at once, and it shall not be the guilt of bringing of the sword that shall be for her. Let a bath be made by you for this man, namely, broth of fresh bacon and the flesh of a heifer to be minced in it under adze and axe, and he to be brought into the bath."

<P>Then up sprang the youths of the court, their lord in danger they well might deem,<BR>
But the strong hand of Fraech had closed firm on the sword, and Finnabar rose from the stream.<BR>
Now with sword in his hand, at the monster's head hewed Fraech, on its side it sank,<BR>
And he came from the river with blade stained red, and the monster he dragged to the bank.<BR>
Twas then Bree's Dub-lind in the Connaught land the Dark Water of Fraech was named,<BR>
From that fight was it called, but the queen and the king went back to their <I>dun</I>, ashamed!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is noble, this deed we have done!" said Maev: "'Tis pitiful," Ailill cried:<BR>
"For the hurt of the man I repent, but to her, our daughter, shall woe betide!<BR>
On the morrow her lips shall be pale, and none shall be found to aver that her guilt,<BR>
{410} When the sword for his succour to Fraech she gave, was the cause why her life was spilt!<BR>
Now see that a bath of fresh bacon broth be prepared that shall heal this prince,<BR>
And bid them with adze and with axe the flesh of a heifer full small to mince:<BR>
Let the meat be all thrown in the bath, and there for healing let Fraech be laid!"<BR>
And all that he ordered was done with care; the queen his command obeyed.</P><DIR>

<P>IT happened that his cows had been in the meanwhile stolen. His mother came to him. "Not active (<I>or</I> "lucky") of journey hast thou gone; it shall cause much of trouble to thee," she says. "Thy cows have been stolen, and thy three sons, and thy wife, so that they are in the mountain of Elpa. Three cows of them are in Alba of the North with the Cruthnechi (the Picts)." "Query, what shall I do?" he says to his mother. "Thou shalt do a non-going for seeking them; thou wouldest not give thy life for them," she says. "Thou shalt have cows at my hands besides them." "Not so this," he says: "I have pledged my hospitality and my soul to go to Ailill and to Medb with my cows to the Spoil of the Cows from Cualnge." "What thou seekest shall not be obtained," says his mother. At this she goes off from him then.</P>

<P>UNTO Fraech it hath chanced, as he roved from his lands<BR>
That his cattle were stolen by wandering bands:<BR>
And there met him his mother, and cried, "On thy way<BR>
Thou hast tarried, and hard for thy slackness shalt pay!<BR>
In the Alps of the south, the wild mountains amid,<BR>
{610} Have thy children, thy wife, and thy cattle been hid:<BR>
And a three of thy kine have the Picts carried forth,<BR>
And in Alba they pasture, but far to the north!"</P>
<P>"Now, alack!" answered Fraech, "what is best to be done?"<BR>
"Rest at home," said his mother, "nor seek them my son;<BR>
For to thee neither cattle, nor children, nor wife<BR>
Can avail, if in seeking thou losest thy life;<BR>
And though cattle be lacking, the task shall be mine<BR>
To replace what is lost, and to grant thee the kine."</P>
<P>"Nay, not so," answered Fraech, "by my soul I am sworn,<BR>
{620} That when cattle from Cualgne by force shall be torn<BR>
To King Ailill and Maev on my faith as their guest<BR>
I must ride with those cattle for war to the west!"<BR>
"Now but vainly," she said, "is this toil on thee cast;<BR>
Thou shalt lose what thou seekest", and from him she passed.</P></DIR>

<P>until he goes to the territory of the Ulstermen, so that he meets with Conall Cernach (Conall the Victorious) at Benna Bairchi (<I>a mountain on the Ulster border</I>).</P>
<P>He tells his quest to him. "What awaits thee," says the latter, "shall not be lucky for thee. Much of trouble awaits thee," he says, "though in it the mind should be." "It will come to me," says Fraech to Connall, "that thou wouldest help me any time we should meet." (?) "I shall go truly," says Conall Cernach. They set of the three (<I>i.e.</I> the three nines) over sea, over Saxony of the North, over the Sea of Icht (the sea between England and France), to the north of the Long-bards (the dwellers of Lombardy), until they reached the mountains of Elpa.

<P>To Ben Barchi they went, for the border of Ulster their faces were set:<BR>
And there, of its marches the warder, the conquering Conall they met.<BR>
Fraech hailed him, the conquering Conall, and told him the tale of his spoil;<BR>
{630} "'Tis ill luck that awaits thee," said Conall, "thy quest shall be followed with toil!<BR>
"'Twill be long ere the goal thou art reaching, though thy heart in the seeking may be."<BR>
"Conall Cernach,[1] hear thou my beseeching said Fraech, "let thine aid be to me;<BR>
I had hoped for this meeting with Conall, that his aid in the quest might be lent."<BR>
"I will go with thee truly," said Conall: with Fraech and his comrades he went.</P><DIR>

<P>Three times nine, Fraech and Conall before them,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over ocean from Ireland have passed;<BR>
Through the Land of North Saxony bore them,<BR>

And again on the sea billows speeding,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{640} They went south, over Ichtian foam;<BR>
And marched on: southward still was their leading:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the land where the Long-Beards have home:<BR>
But when Lombardy's bounds they were nearing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made stand; for above and around<BR>

<P>They went then to a conversation. She said, "Whence are ye?" "Of the men of Erin," says Conall. "It shall not be lucky for the men of Erin truly, the coming to this country. From the men of Erin too is my mother. Aid thou me on account of relationship."</P>
<P>"Tell us something about our movements. What is the quality of the land we have to come to?" "A grim hateful land with troublesome warriors, who go on every side for carrying off cows and women as captives," she says. "What is the latest thing they have carried off?" says Fraech. "The cows of Fraech, son of Idath, from the west of Erin, and his wife, and his three sons. Here is his wife here in the house of the king, here are his cows in the country in front of you." "Let thy aid come to us," says Conall. Little is my power, save guidance only." "This is Fraech," says Conall, and they are his cows that have been carried off." "Is the woman constant in your estimation?" she says. "Though constant in our estimation when she went, perchance she is not constant after coming." "The woman who frequents the cows, go ye to her; tell ye of your errand; of the men of Ireland her race; of the men of Ulster exactly."</P>

<P>'Twere well we should speak with yon woman, perchance she hath wisdom to teach!"<BR>
{650} And with Conall went Fraech at that counsel; they neared her, and held with her speech.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Whence have come you?" she said: "Out of Ireland are we,"<BR>
Answered Conall: "Ill luck shall for Irishmen be<BR>
In this country," she cried, "yet thy help I would win;<BR>
From thy land was my mother; thou art to me kin!"</P>
<P>"Of this land we know naught, nor where next we should turn,"<BR>
Answered Conall.; "its nature from thee we would learn."<BR>
"'Tis a grim land and hateful," the woman replied,<BR>
"And the warriors are restless who forth from it ride;<BR>
For full often of captives, of women and herd<BR>
{660} Of fair kine by them taken is brought to me word."</P>
<P>"Canst thou say what latest spoil," said Fraech, "they won?"<BR>
"Ay," she said, "they harried Fraech, of Idath[1] son<BR>
He in Erin dwelleth, near the western sea;<BR>
Kine from him they carried, wife, and children three<BR>
Here his wife abideth, there where dwells the king,<BR>
Turn, and see his cattle, yonder pasturing."</P>
<P>Out spoke Conall Cernach;[2] "Aid us thou" he cried:<BR>
"Strength I lack," she answered, "I can only guide."<BR>
"Here is Fraech," said Conall, "yon his stolen cows":<BR>
{670} "Fraech!" she asked him, "tell me, canst thou trust thy spouse?"<BR>
"Why," said Fraech, "though trusty, doubtless, when she went;<BR>
Now, since here she bideth, truth may well be spent."<BR>
"See ye now yon woman?" said she, "with your herd,<BR>

<P>"It shall not be lucky for you truly," she says, "the going up to the multitude of the woman; more troublesome to you than everything," she says, "is the serpent which is at guarding of the <I>Liss</I>."

"Whence are ye from the men of Ulster?" she says. "This is Conall Cernach here, the bravest hero with the men of Ulster," says Fraech. She flings two hands around the throat of Conall Cernach. "The destruction has come in this expedition," she says, "since he has come to us; for it is to him the destruction of this dun has been prophesied.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>THIS tale is given by Windisch (<I>Irische Texte</I>, II. pp. 185-205), from two versions; one, whose translation he gives in full, except for one doubtful passage, is from the manuscript in the British Museum, known as Egerton, 1782 (dated 1414); the other is from the Yellow Book of Lecan (fourteenth century), in the library of Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
<P>The version in the Yellow Book is sometimes hard to read, which seems to be the reason why Windisch prefers to translate the younger authority, but though in some places the Egerton version is the fuller, the Yellow Book version (Y.B.L.) often adds passages, some of which Windisch has given in notes; some he has left untranslated. In the following prose version as much of Y.B.L. as adds anything to the Egerton text has been translated, with marks of interrogation where the attempted rendering is not certain: variants from the text adopted are placed below the prose version as footnotes. The insertions from Y.B.L. are indicated by brackets; but no note is taken of cases where the Egerton version is fuller than Y.B.L.</P>
<P>The opening of the story (the first five lines in the verse rendering) is in the eleventh century Book of the Dun Cow: the fragment agrees closely with the two later texts, differing in fact from Y.B.L. in one word only. All three texts are given in the original by Windisch.</P>
<P>The story is simple and straightforward, but is a good example of fairy vengeance, the description of the appearance of the troop recalls similar descriptions in the Tain bo Fraich, and in the Courtship of Ferb. The tale is further noticeable from its connection with the province of Munster: most of the heroic tales are connected with the other three provinces only. Orlam, the hero of the end of the tale, was one of Cuchulain's earliest victims in the Tain bo Cualgne.</P>

</I><P>EOCHO BEC, the son of Corpre, king of Cliu, dwelt in the <I>Dun</I> of Cuillne,[1] and with him were forty fosterlings, all sons of the kings of Munster; he had also forty milch-cows for their sustenance. By Ailill and Medb messengers were sent, asking him to come to a conference. "[In a week,"][2] said Eocho, "I will go to that conference;" and the messengers departed from him.</P>
<P>One night Eocho lay there in his sleep, when he saw something approach him; a woman, and a young man in her attendance. "Ye are welcome!" said Eocho. ["Knowest thou us?"] said she, "Where hast thou learned to know us?" "It seems to me as if I had been near to you." "I think that we have been very near to one another, though we have not seen each other face to face!" "In what place do ye dwell?" said Eocho. "Yonder in Sid Cuillne (the fairy mound of Cuillne)," said she. "And, wherefore have ye come?" "In order to give thee counsel," said she. For what purpose is the counsel," said he, "that thou givest me?"</P>
<P>"Something," she said, "that will bring thee honour and renown on thy journey at home and abroad. A stately troop shall be round thee, and goodly foreign horses shall be under thee."[3] "With how many shall I go?" said Eocho. "Fifty horsemen is the number that is suitable for thee," she answered.</P>

<P>EOCHO BEC,[1] the son of Corpre, reigning in the land of Clew,[2]<BR>

Forty kine who grazed his pastures gave him milk to rear his wards;<BR>
Royal blood his charges boasted, sprung from Munster's noblest lords.<BR>
Maev and Ailill sought to meet him: heralds calling him they sent:<BR>
"Seven days hence I come" said Eocho; and the heralds from him went.<BR>
Now, as Eocho lay in slumber, in the night a vision came;<BR>
By a youthful squire attended, rose to view a fairy dame:<BR>
"Welcome be my greeting to you!" said the king: "Canst thou discern<BR>
{10} Who we are?" the fairy answered, "how didst thou our fashion learn?"<BR>
"Surely," said the king, "aforetime near to me hath been thy place!"<BR>

"Where do ye abide?" said Eocho. "Yonder dwell we, with the <I>Shee</I>:[4]<BR>

"We have come," she said, "a counsel as a gift to thee to bring!"<BR>
"Speak! and tell me of the counsel ye have brought me," said the king.<BR>

<P>"What manner of gift is it that thou desirest?" said Eocho. "Nothing less than a gift of milking-kine," said Ailill. "There is no superfluity of these in my land," said Eocho; "I have forty fosterlings, sons of the kings of Munster, to bring them up (to manhood); they are here in My company, there are forty cows to supply the needs of these, to supply my own needs are seven times twenty milch-cows [there are fifty men for this cause watching over them].</P>
<P>"Let me have from thee," said Ailill, "one cow from each farmer who is under thy lordship as my share; moreover I will yield thee assistance if at any time thou art oppressed by superior might." "Thus let it be as thou sayest," said Eocho; "moreover, they shall come to thee this very day."</P>
<P>For three days and three nights they were hospitably entertained by Ailill and Medb, and then they departed homewards, till they met the sons of Glaschu, who came from Irross Donnan (the peninsula of Donnan, now Mayo); the number of those who met them was seven times twenty men, And they set themselves to attack each other, and to strive with each other in combat, and [at the island of O'Conchada (Inse Ua Conchada)] they fought together. In that place fell the forty sons of kings round Eocho Bec, and that news was spread abroad over all the land of Ireland, so that four times twenty kings' sons, of the youths of Munster, died, sorrowing for the deaths of these princes.</P>
<P>On another night, as Ailill lay in his sleep, upon his bed, he saw some thing, a young man and a woman, the fairest that could be found in Ireland. "Who are ye?" said Ailill. "Victory and Defeat are our names," she said. "Victory indeed is welcome to me, but not so Defeat," said Ailill. "Victory shall be thine in each form!" said she. ["What is the next thing after this that awaits us?" said Ailill. "Not hard to tell thee," said she] "let men march out from thy palace in the morning, that thou mayest win for thyself the cattle of Dartaid, the daughter of Eocho. Forty is the number of her milch-cows, it is thine own son, Orlam mac Ailill, whom she loves. Let Orlam prepare for his journey with a stately troop of valiant men, also forty sons of those kings who dwell in the land of Connaught; and by me shall be given to them the same equipment that the other youths had who fell in yon fight,</P>

<P>Eocho spoke: "What gift requirest thou from me?" "For milking-kine,"<BR>
Ailill said, "I ask"; and Eocho, "Few of these indeed are mine!<BR>
Forty sons of Munster's princes have I in my halls to rear;<BR>
These, my foster-sons, beside me m my troop have journeyed here;<BR>
Fifty herdsmen guard the cattle, forty cows my wards to feed,<BR>
Seven times twenty graze beside them, to supply my people's need."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If, for every man who follows thee as liege, and owns a farm,<BR>
{60} Thou a cow wilt yield," said Ailill, "then from foes with power to harm<BR>
I will guard thee in the battle!" "Keep then faithfully thy vows,"<BR>
Eocho said, "this day as tribute shall to Croghan come the cows."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrice the sun hath set and risen while they feasting there abide,<BR>
Maev and Ailill's bounty tasting, homeward then they quickly ride:<BR>
But the sons of Glaschu met them, who from western Donnan came;<BR>
Donnan, from the seas that bound it, Irross Donnan hath for name;<BR>
Seven times twenty men attacked them, and to battle they were brought,<BR>
At the isle of O'Can&agrave;da, fiercely either party fought;<BR>
With his foster children round him, Eocho Bec in fight was killed,<BR>
{70} All the forty princes perished, with that news the land was filled;<BR>
All through Ireland lamentation rose for every youthful chief;<BR>
Four times twenty Munster princes, weeping for them, died of grief.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a vision came to Ailill, as in sleep he lay awhile,<BR>
or a youth and dame approached him, fairer none in Erin's Isle:<BR>
"Who are ye?" said Ailill; "Conquest," said the fairy, "and Defeat<BR>
"Though Defeat I shun," said Ailill, "Conquest joyfully I meet."<BR>
"Conquest thou shalt have!" she answered: "Of the future I would ask,<BR>
Canst thou read my fate?" said Ailill: "Light indeed for me the task,"<BR>
Said the dame: "the kine of Dartaid, Eocho's daughter, may be won:<BR>
Forty cows she owns; to gain them send to her thy princely son,<BR>
Orlam, whom that maiden loveth: let thy son to start prepare,<BR>
{80} Forty youths from Connaught with him, each of them a prince's heir:<BR>

<P>Then they depart from him, and forthwith they go to [Corp[1] Liath (the Gray),] who was the son of Tassach. His castle was on the bank of the river Nemain, upon the northern side, he was a champion of renown for the guarding of the men of Munster; longer than his hand is the evil he hath wrought. To this man also they appeared, and "What are your names?" said he: "Tecmall and Coscrad (Gathering of Hosts, and Destruction)," said they. "Gathering of Hosts is indeed good," said Corp Liath, "an evil thing is destruction": "There will be no destruction for thee, and thou shalt destroy the sons of kings and nobles": "And what," said Corp Liath, "is the next thing to be done?"</P>
<P>"That is easy to say," they said;[2] "each son of a king and a queen, and each heir of a king that is in Connaught, is now coming upon you to bear off cows from your country, for that the sons of your kings and queens have fallen by the hand of the men of Connaught. To-morrow morning, at the ninth hour they will come, and small is their troop; so if valiant warriors go thither to meet them, the honour of Munster shall be preserved; if indeed thine adventure shall meet with success."</P>
<P>"With what number should I go?" he said. "Seven times twenty heroes thou shouldest take with thee," she replied, ["and seven times twenty warriors besides"]: "And now" said the woman, "we depart to meet thee to-morrow at the ninth hour."</P>
<P>At the time (appointed), when morning had come, the men of Connaught saw the horses and the raiment of which we have spoken, at the gate of the fort of Croghan, [even as she (the fairy) had foretold, and as we have told, so that at that gate was all she had promised, and all that had been seen on the sons of kings aforetime], and there was a doubt among the people whether they should go on that quest or not. "It is shame," said Ailill,</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Egerton MS. gives the name, Corb Cliach.</P>
<P>2. Y.B.L. gives the passage thus: "Assemble with you the sons of kings, and heirs of kings, that you may destroy the sons of kings and heirs of kings." "Who are they?" said Corp Liath. "A noble youth it is from Connaught: he comes to yon to drive your cows before him, after that your young men were yesterday destroyed by him, at the ninth hour of the morning they will come to take away the cows of Darta, the daughter of Eocho."]</P>

On the northern bank of Naymon was his hold, and there he lay;<BR>
And before the men of Munster, as their champion did he stand:<BR>
{90} He hath wrought-so runs the proverb-evil, longer than his hand.<BR>
As to Corp appeared the vision: "Say," he cried, "what names ye boast!"<BR>
"Ruin, one is called," they answered; "one, The Gathering of the Host!"<BR>
An assembled host I welcome," answered them the gray Corp Lee;<BR>
"Ruin I abhor": "And ruin," they replied, "is far from thee;<BR>
Thou shalt bring on sons of nobles, and of kings a ruin great":<BR>
"Fairy," said Corp Lee, the Gray one, "tell me of that future fate."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Easy is the task," she answered, "youths of every royal race<BR>

"We cannot wait for these; let the men take provision on their horses, [for rightly should we be afraid in the midst of Munster. Wilt thou depart with me, O maiden?" said he. "I will indeed go with thee," said she]. "Come then thou," said he, "and with thee all of thy cows."</P>
<P>[Then the young men go away with the cows in the midst, and the maiden was with them; but Corp Liath, the son of Tassach, met them with seven times twenty warriors to oppose their march.

<P>THE two versions of this tale, given by Windisch in the <I>Irische Texte</I>, II. pp. 224-238, are from the same manuscripts as the two versions of the Raid of the Cattle of Dartaid; namely the Yellow Book of Lecan, and the Egerton MS. 1782. In the case of this tale, the Yellow Book version is more legible, and, being not only the older, but a little more full than the other version, Windisch has translated this text alone: the prose version, as given here, follows this manuscript, nearly as given by Windisch, with only one addition from the Egerton MS.; the omissions in the Egerton MS. are not mentioned, but one or two changes in words adopted from this MS. are mentioned in the foot-notes to the prose rendering.</P>
<P>The whole tone of the tale is very unlike the tragic character of those romances, which have been sometimes supposed to represent the general character of old Irish literature: there is not even a hint of the super-natural; the story contains no slaughter; the youthful raiders seem to be regarded as quite irresponsible persons, and the whole is an excellent example of an old Celtic: romance with what is to-day called a "good ending."</P>

<P>IN the time of Ailill and Medb, a glorious warrior and holder of land dwelt in the land of Connaught, and his name was Regamon. He had many herds of cattle, all of them fair and well-shaped: he had also seven daughters with him. Now the seven sons of Ailill and Medb loved these (daughters): namely the seven Maine, these were Maine Morgor (Maine with great filial love), Maine Mingar (Maine with less filial love), Maine Aithremail (Maine like his father), Maine Mathremail (Maine like his mother), Maine Milbel (Maine with the mouth of honey),[1] Maine Moepert (Maine too great to be described), Maine Condageb-uile (Maine who combined all qualities): now this one had the form both of father and mother, and had all the glory that belonged to both parents.</P>

<P>WHEN Ailill and Maev in the Connaught land abode, and the lordship held,<BR>
A chief who many a field possessed in the land of Connaught dwelled:<BR>
A great, and a fair, and a goodly herd of kine had the chieftain won:<BR>
And his fame in the fight was in all men's word; his name was Regamon.<BR>
Now seven daughters had Regamon; they dwelt at home with their sire:<BR>
Yet the seven sons of King Ailill and Maev their beauty with love could fire:<BR>
All those seven sons were as Mani[1] known; the first was as Morgor hailed,<BR>
For his love was great: it was Mingar's fate that in filial love he failed:<BR>
The face was seen of the mother-queen on the third; and his father's face<BR>
{10} Did the fourth son show: they the fifth who know cannot speak all his strength and grace:<BR>
The sixth son spoke, from his lips the words like drops of honey fell:<BR>
And last came one who all gifts possessed that the tongue of a man can tell;<BR>
For his father's face that Mani had, in him was his mother seen;<BR>

<P>The seven daughters of Regamon were the three Dunann, and the four Dunlaith;[1] from the names of these is the estuary of Dunann in western Connaught, and the Ford of Dunlaith in Breffny.</P>
<P>Now at a certain time, Ailill and Medb and Fergus held counsel together. "Some one from us," said Ailill, "should go to Regamon, that a present of cattle may be brought to us from him; to meet the need that there is on us for feeding the men of Ireland, when the kine are raided from Cualgne." "I know," said Medb, "who would be good to go thither, if we ask it of them; even the Maine; on account of their love for the daughters."</P>
<P>His sons were called to Ailill, and he spoke with them. "Grateful is he, and a better journey does he go," said Maev, "who goes for the sake of his filial love." "Truly it shall be that it is owing to filial love that we go," said Mani Morgor. "But the reward should (also) for this be the better," said Mani Mingar; "it stands ill with our heroism, ill with our strength.</P>

<P>Of the daughters of Regamon now we speak: two names those maidens bore:<BR>
For as Dunnan three ever known shall be; Dunlaith[1] was the name for four:<BR>
And in Breffny's land is the Ford Dunlaith, and the fame of the four recalls;<BR>
The three ye know where the Dunnan's flow in western Connaught falls.<BR>
With Fergus, Ailill and Maev were met: as at council all conferred;<BR>
{20} "It were well for our folk," thus Ailill spoke, "if the lord of that cattle-herd,<BR>
That strays in the fields of Regamon, would tribute to us pay:<BR>
And to gain that end, let us heralds send, to his burg who may make their way,<BR>
And bear to our court that tribute back; for greatly we soon shall need<BR>
Such kine when we in the time of war our hosts shall have to feed;<BR>
And all who share in our counsels know that a burden will soon be mine,<BR>
When the men must be fed of Ireland, led on the Raid for the Cuailgne[2] Kine!"<BR>
Thus Ailill spoke; and Queen Maev replied, "The men to perform that task<BR>
Right well I know; for our sons will go, if we for their aid but ask!<BR>
The seven daughters of Regamon do the Mani in love now seek:<BR>
{30} If those maidens' hands they can gain by the deed, they will heed the words we speak."<BR>
To his side King Ailill has called his sons, his mind to the youth he shows.<BR>
"Best son," says Maev, "and grateful he, from filial love who goes!"<BR>
And Morgor said, "For the love that we owe, we go at our sire's behest:"<BR>
"Yet a greater reward," thus Mingar spake, "must be ours, if we go on this quest!<BR>
For naught have we of hero-craft; and small shall be found our might;<BR>
And of valiant breed are the men," said he, "with whom we shall have to fight.</P></DIR>

<P>They took leave of Ailill and Medb, and betook themselves to the quest, They set out, seven times twenty heroes was the number, till they were in the south of Connaught, in the neighbourhood of the domain of Corcomroe[1] in the land of Ninnus, near to the burg. "Some of you," said Mani Morgor, "should go to find out how to enter into the burg; and to test the love of maidens." Mani Mingar, with two others, went until he came upon three of the maidens at the water-springs, and at once he and his comrades drew their swords against them. "Give life for life!" said the maiden. "Grant to me then my three full words!" said Mani Mingar. "Whatever thy tongue sets forth shall be done," said the maiden, "only let it not be cows,[2] for these have we no power to give thee."

We must test the strength of the maidens' love!" On Mingar the task was set,<BR>

The seven maidens went to the well, and they greeted Mani. "Come ye away," he said, "and bring your cattle with you. That will be a good deed. We shall assist you with our honour and our protection, O ye daughters of Regamon," said he.[1] The maidens drove together their cows and their swine, and their sheep, so that none observed them; and they secretly passed on till they came to the camp of their comrades. The maidens greeted the sons of Ailill and Medb, and they remained there standing together. "The herd must be divided in two parts," said Mani Merger, "also the host must divide, for it is too great to travel by the one way; and we shall meet again at Ath Briuin (the Ford of Briuin)."

<P>"We all," said Mani, "must go to one place, and some of you shall be sent to the cattle to summon the young men hither, and the maidens shall drive the cattle over the ford to Cruachan, and shall give Ailill and Medb tidings of the plight in which we are here." The maidens went to Cruachan, and told all the tale. "Thy sons are at Ath Briuin in distress, and have said that help should be brought to them." The men of Connaught with Ailill, and Medb, and Fergus, and the banished men of Ulster went to Ath Briuin to help their people.</P>
<P>The sons of Ailill had for the moment made hurdles of white-thorn and black-thorn in the gut[1] of the ford, as defence against Regamon and his people, so that they were unable to pass through the ford ere Ailill and his army came;</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE DRIVING OF THE CATTLE OF FLIDAIS</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>THE Tain bo Flidais, the Driving of the Cows of Flidais, does not, like the other three Preludes to the Tain bo Cualnge, occur in the Yellow Book of Lecan; but its manuscript age is far the oldest of the four, as it occurs in both the two oldest collections of Old Irish romance, the Leabbar na h-Uidhri (abbreviated to L.U.), and the Book of Leinster (abbreviated to L.L.), besides the fifteenth century Egerton MS., that contains the other three preludes. The text of all three, together with a translation of the L.U. text, is given by Windisch in <I>Irische Texte</I>, II. pp. 206-223; the first part of the story is missing in L.U. and is supplied from the Book of Leinster (L.L.) version. The prose translation given here follows Windisch's translation pretty closely, with insertions occasionally from L.L. The Egerton version agrees closely with L.L., and adds little to it beyond variations in spelling, which have occasionally been taken in the case of proper names. The Leabhar na h-Uidhri version is not only the oldest, but has the most details of the three; a few passages have, however, been supplied from the other manuscripts which agree with L.U. in the main.</P>
<P>The whole tale is much more like an old Border riding ballad than are the other three Preludes; it resembles the tone of Regamon, but differs from it in having a good deal of slaughter to relate, though it can hardly be called tragic, like Deirdre and Ferb, the killing being taken as a matter of course. There is nothing at all supernatural about the story as contained in the old manuscripts, but a quite different' version of the story given in the Glenn Masain Manuscript, a fifteenth century manuscript now in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, gives another complexion to the tale.</P>
<P>The translation of this manuscript is at present being made in the Celtic Review by Professor Mackinnon; the version it gives of the story is much longer and fuller than that in the Leabhar na h-Uidhri, and its</P>
<P>{p. 104}</P>
<P>accompanying manuscripts. The translation as printed in the Celtic Review is not as yet (July 1905) completed, but, through Professor Mackinnon's kindness, an abstract of the general features of the end of the story may be given here.</P>
<P>The Glenn Masain version makes Bricriu, who is a subordinate character in the older version, one of the principal actors, and explains many of the allusions which are difficult to understand in the shorter version; but it is not possible to regard the older version as an abridgment of that preserved in the Glenn Masain MS., for the end of the story in this manuscript is absolutely different from that in the older ones, and the romance appears to be unique in Irish in that it has versions which give two quite different endings, like the two versions of Kipling's <I>The Light that Failed</I>.</P>
<P>The Glenn Masain version commences with a feast held at Cruachan, when Fergus and his exiles had joined their forces with Connaught as a result of the murder of the Sons of Usnach, as told in the earlier part of the manuscript. At this feast Bricriu. engages in conversation with Fergus, reproaching him for his broken promises to the Ulstermen who had joined him, and for his dalliance with Queen Maev. Bricriu, who in other romances is a mere buffoon, here appears as a distinguished poet, and a chief ollave; his satire remains bitter, but by no means scurrilous, and the verses put into his mouth, although far beneath the standard of the verses given to Deirdre in the earlier part of the manuscript, show a certain amount of dignity and poetic power. As an example, the following satire on Fergus's inability to keep his promises may be cited:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Fergus, hear thy friend lamenting!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blunted is thy lofty mind;<BR>
Thou, for hire, to Maev consenting,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thy valour's pride resigned.</P>
<P>Ere another year's arriving,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should thy comrades, thou didst vow,<BR>
Three-score chariots fair be driving,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shields and weapons have enow!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{p. 105}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When thy ladies, bent on pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowd towards the banquet-hall,<BR>
Thou of gold a goodly measure<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promised hast to grant to all!</P>
<P>Ill to-night thy friends are faring,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught hath Fergus to bestow;<BR>
He a poor man's look is wearing,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never yet was greater woe!</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>After the dialogue with Fergus, Bricriu, with the poets that attend him, undertakes a journey to Ailill the Fair, to obtain from him the bounty that Fergus had promised but was unable to grant. He makes a fairly heavy demand upon Ailill's bounty, but is received hospitably, and gets all he had asked for, as well as honour for his poetic talents. He then asks about Ailill's wife Flidais, and is told about her marvellous cow, which was able to supply milk to more than three hundred men at one night's milking. Flidais returns from a journey, is welcomed by Bricriu, who produces a poem in honour of her and her cow, and is suitably recompensed.</P>
<P>A long conversation is then recorded between Flidais and Bricriu in which Bricriu extols the great deeds of Fergus, supplying thereby a commentary on the short statement at the beginning of the older version, that Flidais' love to Fergus was on account of the great deeds which had been told her that he had done. Flidais declares to Bricriu her love for Fergus, and Bricriu, after a vain attempt to dissuade the queen from her purpose, consents to bring a message to Fergus that Flidais and her cow will come to him if he comes to her husband's castle to seek her. He then returns to Connaught laden with gifts.</P>
<P>The story now proceeds somewhat upon the lines of the older version. Bricriu approaches Fergus on his return, and induces him to go in the guise of an ambassador to Ailill the Fair, with the secret intention of carrying off Flidais. Fergus receives the sanction of Maev and her husband for his errand, and departs, but not as in the older version with a few followers; all the Ulster exiles are with him. Dubhtach, by killing a servant of Maev, embroils Fergus with the queen of Connaught; and the</P>
<P>{106}</P>
<P>expedition reaches Ailill the Fair's castle. Fergus sends Bricriu, who has most unwillingly accompanied him, to ask for hospitality; he is hospitably received by Ailill, and when under the influence of wine reveals to Ailill the plot. Ailill does not, as in the older version, refuse to receive Fergus, but seats him beside himself at a feast, and after reproaching him with his purpose challenges him to a duel in the morning. The result of the duel, and of the subsequent attack on the castle by Fergus' friends, is much as stated in the older version, but the two stories end quite differently. The L.U. version makes Flidais assist in the War of Cualgne by feeding the army of Ailill each seventh day with the produce of her cows; she dies after the war as wife of Fergus; the Glenn Masain version, in the "<I>Pursuit of the Cattle of Flidais</I>," makes the Gamanrad clan, the hero-clan of the West of Ireland, pursue Maev and Fergus, and rescue Flidais and her cow; Flidais then returns to the west with Muiretach Menn, the son of her murdered husband, Ailill the Fair.</P>
<P>The comparison of these two versions, from the literary point of view, is most interesting. The stress laid on the supernatural cow is peculiar to the version in the later manuscript, the only analogy in the eleventh century version is the semi-supernatural feeding of the army of Ireland, but in this it is a herd (<I>buar</I>), not a single animal, that is credited with the feat, and there is really nothing supernatural about the matter; it is only the other version that enables us to see the true bearing of the incident. The version in the Glenn Masain Manuscript looks much more ancient in idea than that in the older texts, and is plainly capable of a mythic interpretation. It is not of course suggested that the Glenn Masain version is ancient as it stands: there are indeed enough obvious allusions in the text to comparatively late works to negative such a supposition, independently of linguistic evidence, but it does look as if the author of the eleventh century text had a super natural tale to work upon, some of whose incidents are preserved in the Glenn Masain version, and that he succeeded in making out of the traditional account a story that practically contains no supernatural element at all, so that it requires a knowledge of the other version to discover the slight trace of the supernatural that he did keep, viz. the feeding of the army of Ireland by the herd (not the cow) of Flidais.</P>
<P>It is possible that the common origin of the two versions is preserved for us in another place, the <I>Coir Annam</I>, which, though it as it stands is a Middle</P>
<P>{p. 107}</P>
<P>Irish work, probably keeps ancient tradition better than the more finished romances. In this we find, following Stokes' translation, given in Irische Texte, III. P. 295, the following entries:--</P>
<P>"Adammair Flidaise Foltch&aacute;in, that is Flidais the Queen, one of the tribe of the god-folk (the Tuatha d&eacute; Danaan), she was wife of Adammair, the son of Fer Cuirp, and from her cometh the name <I>Buar Flidaise</I>, the Cattle of Flidais.</P>
<P>"Nia S&eacute;gamain, that is <I>s&eacute;g</I> (deer) are a <I>m&aacute;in</I> (his treasure), for in his time cows and does were milked in the same way every day, so that he had great wealth in these things beyond that of all other kings. The Flidais spoken of above was the mother of Nia S&eacute;gamain, Adammair's son, for two kinds of cattle, cows and does, were milked in the days of Nia S&eacute;gamain, and by his mother was that fairy power given to him."</P>
<P>It seems, then, not impossible that the original legend was much as stated in the Coir Annam, viz. that Flidais was a supernatural being, milking wild deer like cows, and that she was taken into the Ulster Cycle and made part of the tale of Fergus.</P>
<P>This adoption was done by an author who made a text which may be regarded as the common original of the two versions; in his tale the supernatural character of Flidais was retained. The author of the L.U. version cut out the supernatural part, and perhaps the original embassy of Bricriu; it may, however, be noted that the opening of the older version comes from the L.L. text, which is throughout shorter than that in L.U., and the lost opening of L.U. may have been fuller. The author of the Glenn Masain version kept nearer to the old story, adding, however, more modern touches. Where the new character of Bricriu comes from is a moot point; I incline to the belief that the idea of Bricriu as a mere buffoon is a later development. But in neither version is the story, as we have it, a pre-Christian one. The original pre-Christian idea of Flidais was, as in the Coir Annam, that of a being outside the Ulster Cycle altogether.</P>

<P>FLIDAIS was the wife of Ailill Finn (the Fair-haired) in the district of Kerry.[1] She loved Fergus the son of R&oacute;g on account of the glorious tales about him; and always there went messengers from her to him at the end of each week.</P>
<P>So, when he came to Connaught, he brought this matter before[2] Ailill: "What[3] shall I do next in this matter?" said Fergus: "it is hard for me to lay bare your land, without there being loss to thee of honour and renown therewith." "Yes, what shall we do next in the matter?" said Ailill; "we will consider this in counsel with Maev." "Let one of us go to Ailill Finn," (said Maev), "that he may help us, and as this involves a meeting of some one with him, there is no reason why it should not be thyself who goest to him: the gift will be all the better for that!"</P>

<P>A LAND in West Roscommon, as Kerry known of old,<BR>
Was ruled by Ailill Fair-haired; of him a tale is told:<BR>
How Flidais,[1] Ailill's [2] consort, each week, and near its end,<BR>
To R&oacute;'s great son, to Fergus, her herald still would send;<BR>
'Twas Fergus' love she sought for; the deeds by Fergus done,<BR>
In glorious tales recited, had Flidais' fancy won.</P>
<P>When Fergus fled from Ulster, and Connaught's land he sought,<BR>
To Ailill, king of Connaught, this tale of love he brought:<BR>
"Now give me rede," said Fergus, "how best we here should act,<BR>
{10} That Connaught's fame and honour by none may stand attacked;<BR>
Say, how can I approach them, and strip thy kingdom bare,<BR>
And yet the fame of Ailill, that country's monarch, spare?"<BR>
"'Tis hard indeed to teach thee," cried Ailill, sore perplexed;<BR>
"Let Maev come nigh with counsel what course to follow next!"</P>
<P>"Send thou to Ailill Fair-haired to ask for aid!" said Maev,<BR>
"He well may meet a herald, who comes his help to crave<BR>
Let Fergus go to crave it: no harm can there be seen;<BR>

<P>Then Fergus set out thereon, in number thirty men; the two Ferguses (<I>i.e.</I> Fergus mac R&oacute;g, and Fergus mac Oen-lama) and Dubhtach; till they were at the Ford of Fenna in the north of the land of Kerry. They go to the burg, and welcome is brought to them.[1] "What brings you here?" said Ailill Finn. "We had the intention of staying with you on a visit, for we have a quarrel with Ailill the son of Magach."</P>
<P>"If it were one of thy people who had the quarrel, he should stay with me until he had made his peace. But thou shalt not stay," said Ailill Finn, "it has been told me that my wife loves thee!" "We must have a gift of cows then," said Fergus, "for a great need lies on us, even the sustenance of the troop who have gone with me into exile." "Thou shalt carry off no such present from me," he said, "because thou art not remaining with me on a visit. Men will say that it is to keep my wife that I gave thee what thou hast required. I[2] Will give to your company one ox and some bacon to help them, if such is your pleasure." "I will eat not thy bread although offered (<I>lit.</I> however)," said Fergus, "because I can get no present of honour from thee!"</P>
<P>"Out of my house with you all, then!" said Ailill.</P>
<P>"That shall be," said Fergus; "we shall not begin to lay siege to thee and they betake themselves outside.</P>

<P>Beside the Ford of Fenna, in Kerry's north they came,<BR>
They neared the hold, and from it rang welcome's loud acclaim:<BR>
"What quest," said Ailill Fair-haired, "hath brought these warriors here?"<BR>
"Of Ailill, son of Magach, we stand," they said, "in fear;<BR>
A feud we hold against him; with thee would fain abide!"<BR>
"For each of these," said Ailill, "who Fergus march beside,<BR>

"Avoid my house," said Ailill in wrath, "now get thee hence!<BR>

<P>"That[1] will not for the sake of my honour be refused," said Ailill; "I will not hand it (the strife) over to another: I will go myself," said he. He went to a ford against him. "Which of us," said Fergus, "O Dubhtach, shall encounter this man?" "I will go," said Dubhtach; "I am younger and keener than thou art!" Dubhtach went against Ailill. Dubhtach thrust a spear through Ailill so that it went through his two thighs. He (Ailill) hurled a javelin at Dubhtach, so that he drove the spear right through him, (so that it came out) on the other side.</P>
<P>Fergus threw his shield over Dubhtach. The former (Ailill) thrust his spear at the shield of Fergus so that he even drove the shaft right through it. Fergus mac Oen-laimi comes by. Fergus mac Oen-laimi holds a shield in front of him (the other Fergus). Ailill struck his spear upon this so that it was forced right through it. He leaped so that he lay there on the top of his companions. Flidais comes by from the castle, and throws her cloak over the three.</P>
<P>Fergus' people took to flight; Ailill pursues them. There remain (slain) by him twenty men of them. Seven of them escape to Cruachan Ai, and tell there the whole story to Ailill and Medb.</P>

<P>Then up and answered Ailill: "'Tis mine this strife must be<BR>

"Now Dubhtach, say," said Fergus, "to whom this war is brought!<BR>

<P>To the ford for the battle with Ailill he hies,<BR>
And he thrust at him fiercely, and pierced through his thighs;<BR>
But a javelin by Ailill at Dubhtach was cast,<BR>
And right through his body the shaft of it passed:<BR>
And a shield over Dubhtach, laid low in the dust,<BR>

<P>Meanwhile the wounded men were being cared for by Flidais in the castle, and their healing was undertaken by her.</P>
<P>Then the troops come to the castle. Ailill Finn is summoned to Ailill mac Mata to come to a conference with him outside the castle. "I will not go," he said; "the pride and arrogance of that man there is great."</P>
<P>It was,[1] however, for a peaceful meeting that Ailill mac Mata had come to Ailill the Fair-haired, both that he might save Fergus, as it was right he should, and that he might afterwards make peace with him (Ailill Fair haired), according to the will of the lords of Connaught.</P>

<P>Then roused himself King Ailill, of Connaught's land the king,<BR>
With Maev to march to battle, their aid to friends to bring:<BR>
And forth from Connaught's kingdom went many a lord of worth,<BR>
Beside them marched the exiles who gat from Ulster birth:<BR>

And near the Ford of Fenna they came, and there made stand.</P><DIR>

"I come to no such meeting," the angry chief replied;<BR>

<P>Then the men attack him (Ailill Finn): while they are storming the castle, and they could get no hold on him, a full week long went it thus with them. Seven times twenty heroes from among the nobles of Connaught fell during the time that they (endeavoured) to storm the castle of Ailill the Fair-haired.</P>
<P>"It was with no good omen that with which you went to this castle," said Bricriu. "True indeed is the word that is spoken," said Ailill mac Mata. "The expedition is bad for the honour of the Ulstermen, in that their three heroes fall, and they take not vengeance for them. Each one (of the three) was a pillar of war, yet not a single man has fallen at the hands of one of the three! Truly these heroes are great to be under such wisps of straw as axe the men of this castle! Most worthy is it of scorn that one man has wounded you three!"</P>
<P>"O woe is me," said Bricriu, "long is the length upon the ground of my Papa Fergus, since one man in single combat laid him low!"</P>

<P>At the castle of Ailill the Fair-Haired the Connaught-men rushed in attack,<BR>
And to win it they failed: from his ramparts in defeat were his foes driven back:<BR>
For long in that contest they struggled, yet naught in the fight they prevailed -<BR>
For a week were the walls of the castle of Ailill the Fair-Haired assailed,<BR>
Seven score of the nobles of Connaught, and all of them warriors of might,<BR>
For the castle of Ailill contended, and fell as they strove in the fight.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{110} "'Tis sure that with omen of evil this castle was sought by our folk!"<BR>
Thus Bricroo,[1] the Poisonous Scoffer, in mockery, jeering them, spoke:<BR>
"The taunt," answered Ailill Mae Mata, "is true, and with grief I confess<BR>
That the fame of the heroes of Ulster hereafter is like to be less,<BR>
For a three of the Ulstermen's champions in stress of the fight have been quelled;<BR>
And the vengeance we wait for from Ulster hath long been by Ulster withheld;<BR>
As a pillar of warfare each hero, 'twas claimed, could a battle sustain;<BR>
Yet by none of the three in this battle hath a foeman been conquered, or slain!<BR>
{120} In the future for all of these champions shall scorn and much mocking befall:<BR>
One man hath come forth from yon castle; alone he hath wounded them all--<BR>
Such disgrace for such heroes of valour no times that are past ever saw,<BR>
For three lords of the battle lie conquered by mannikins, fashioned of straw!"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! woe is me," said Bricroo, "how long, thus stretched on ground,<BR>
The length of Father Fergus hath here by all been found!<BR>
But one he sought to conquer; a single fight essayed,<BR>
And here he met his victor, and low on land is laid."</P></DIR>

<P>Then the champions of Ulster arise, naked as they were, and make a strong and obstinate attack in their rage and in the might of their violence, so that they forced in the outer gateway till it was in the midst of the castle, and the men of Connaught go beside them. They storm the castle with great might against the valiant warriors who were there. A wild pitiless battle is fought between them, and each man begins to strike out against the other, and to destroy him.</P>
<P>Then, after they had wearied of wounding and overcoming one another, the people of the castle were overthrown, and the Ulstermen slay seven hundred warriors there in the castle with Ailill the Fair-Haired and thirty of his sons; and Amalgaid the Good;[1] and N&uacute;ado; and Fiacho Muinmethan (Fiacho the Broad-backed); and Corpre Cromm (the Bent or Crooked); and Ailill from Brefne; and the three Oengus Bodbgnai (the Faces of Danger); and the three Eochaid of Irross (<I>i.e.</I> Irross Donnan); and the seven Breslene from Ai; and the fifty Domnall.</P>

And down the shattered portal within the castle crashed.<BR>
Then close by Ulster's champions was Connaught's battle formed;<BR>
{130} And Connaught's troops with Ulster by might the castle stormed;<BR>
But fitly framed for battle were men whom there they met,<BR>
Wild war, where none showed pity between the hosts was set:<BR>
And well they struck; each hero commenced with mighty blows<BR>
To crush and slay, destruction was heaped by foe on foes.</P>
<P>Of the wounding at length and the slaughter all weary the champions had grown,<BR>

This then was the Herd of Flidais.</P>
<P>In consequence[2] of all this Flidais went with Fergus to his home, and he received the lordship of a part of Ulster, even Mag Murthemni (the plain of Murthemne), together with that which had been in the hands of Cuchulain, the son of Sualtam.

<P>THIS tale is given by the same two manuscripts that give the Tain bo Dartada and the Tain bo Regamon; namely the Yellow Book of Lecan, and Egerton 1782. The text of both is given by Windisch, <I>Irische Texte</I>, II. pp. 239-254; he gives a translation of the version in the Yellow Book, with a few insertions from the Egerton MS., where the version in Y.B.L. is apparently corrupt: Miss Hull gives an English translation of Windisch's rendering, in the Cuchullin Saga, pages 103 to 107. The prose version given here is a little closer to the Irish than Miss Hull's, and differs very little from that of Windisch. The song sung by the Morrigan to Cuchulain is given in the Irish of both versions by Windisch; he gives no rendering, as it is difficult and corrupt: I can make nothing of it, except that it is a jeering account of the War of Cualgne.</P>
<P>The title Tain bo Regamna is not connected with anything in the tale, as given; Windisch conjectures "Tain bo Morrigna," the Driving of the Cow of the Great Queen (Morrigan); as the woman is called at the end of the Egerton version. The Morrigan, one of the three goddesses of war, was the chief of them: they were Morrigan, Badb, and Macha. She is also the wife of the Dagda, the chief god of the pagan Irish. The Yellow Book version calls her Badb in this tale, but the account in the Tain bo Cualnge (Leabhar na h-Uidhri facsimile, pp. 74 and 77), where the prophecies are fulfilled, agrees with the Egerton version in calling the woman of this tale the Morrigan or the Great Queen.</P>

<P>WHEN Cuchulain lay in his sleep at Dun Imrid, there he heard a cry from the north; it came straight towards him; the cry was dire, and most terrifying to him. And he awaked in the midst of his sleep, so that he fell, with the fall of a heavy load, out of his couch,[1] to the ground on the eastern side of his house. He went out thereupon without his weapons, so that he was on the lawns before his house, but his wife brought out, as she followed behind him, his arms and his clothing. Then he saw Laeg in his harnessed chariot, coming from Ferta Laig, from the north; and "What brings thee here?" said Cuchulain. "A cry," said Laeg, "that I heard sounding over the plains. "On what side was it?" said Cuchulain. "From the north-west it seemed," said Laeg, "that is, across the great road of Caill Cuan.

From his couch on that side of the castle that the rising sun first found.<BR>
He left his arms in the castle, as the lawns round its walls he sought,<BR>
But his wife, who followed behind him, apparel and arms to him brought:<BR>

From Ferta Laig who drave it: from the north the car drew near:<BR>

Then they saw the chariot come before them, and one chestnut (<I>lit.</I> red) horse in it. The horse was one footed, and the pole of the chariot passed through the body of the horse, till a wedge went through it, to make it fast on its forehead. A red[1] woman was in the chariot, and a red mantle about her, she had two red eye-brows, and the mantle fell between the two <I>ferta</I>[2] of her chariot behind till it struck upon the ground behind her. A great man was beside her chariot, a red[3] cloak was upon him, and a forked staff of hazel at his back, he drove a cow in front of him.</P>
<P>"That cow is not joyful at being driven by you!" said Cuchulain. "The cow does not belong to you," said the woman, "she is not the cow of any friend or acquaintance of yours." "The cows of Ulster," said Cuchulain, "are my proper (care)." "Dost thou give a decision about the cow?" said the woman; "the task is too great to which thy hand is set, O Cuchulain." "Why is it the woman who answers me?" said Cuchulain, "why was it not the man?" "It was not the man whom you addressed," said the woman. "Ay," said Cuchulain, "(I did address him), though thyself hath answered for him:" "h-Uar-gaeth-sceo-luachair-sceo[4] is his name," said she.</P>

{40} He cried, as he leapt at the woman; his feet on her shoulders he pressed,<BR>
And he set on her head his spear-point: "Now cease from thy sharp weapon-play!"<BR>
Cried the woman. Cuchulain made answer: Thy name to me truth fully say!"<BR>
"Then remove thyself from me!" she answered: I am skilled in satirical spells;<BR>
The man is called Darry I mac Feena: in the country of Cualgne[3] he dwells;<BR>
I of late made a marvellous poem; and as fee for the poem this cow<BR>
Do I drive to my home." "Let its verses," said Cuchulain," be sung to me now!"<BR>
"Then away from me stand!" said the woman: "though above me thou shakest thy spear,<BR>
It will naught avail thee to move me." Then he left her, but lingered near,<BR>
Between the poles of her chariot: the woman her song then sang;<BR>
{50} And the song was a song of insult. Again at the car he sprang,<BR>
But nothing he found before him: as soon as the car he had neared,<BR>
The woman, the horse, and the chariot, the cow, and the man disappeared.</P></DIR>

<P>Then he saw that she had become a black bird upon a branch near to him. "A dangerous[1] (or magical) woman thou art," said Cuchulain: "Henceforward," said the woman, "this clay-land shall be called <I>dolluid</I> (of evil,)" and it has been the Grellach Dolluid ever since. "If only I had known it was you," said Cuchulain, "not thus should we have separated." "What thou hast done," said she, "shall be evil to thee from it." "Thou hast no power against me," said Cuchulain. "I have power indeed," said the woman; "it is at the guarding of thy death that I am; and I shall be," said she. "I brought this cow out of the fairy-mound of Cruachan, that she might breed by the Black Bull[2] of Cualnge, that is the Bull of Daire Mae Fiachna. It is up to that time that thou art in life, so long as the calf which is in this cow's body is a yearling; and it is this that shall lead to the Tain bo Cualnge." "I shall myself be all the more glorious for that Tain," said Cuchulain: "I shall slay their warriors: I shall break their great hosts: I shall be survivor of the Tain."</P>

<P>At a bird on a bough, as they vanished, a glance by Cuchulain was cast,<BR>
And he knew to that bird's black body the shape of the woman had passed:<BR>
As a woman of danger I know you," he cried, "and as powerful in spell!"<BR>
From to-day and for ever," she chanted, "this tale in yon clay-land shall dwell!"<BR>
And her word was accomplished; that region to-day is the Grella Dolloo,[1]<BR>
The Clay-land of Evil: its name from the deeds of that woman it drew.</P>
<P>"Had I known it was you," said Cuchulain, "not thus had you passed from my sight! "<BR>
{60} And she sang, "For thy deed it is fated that evil shall soon be thy plight!"<BR>
Thou canst. do naught against me," he answered. "Yea, evil in sooth can I send;<BR>
Of thy Bringer of Death I am guardian, shall guard it till cometh thine end:<BR>

<P>"In what way canst thou do this?" said the woman, "for when thou art in combat against a man of equal strength (to thee), equally rich in victories, thine equal in feats, equally fierce, equally untiring, equally noble, equally brave, equally great with thee, I will be an eel, and I will draw a noose about thy feet in the ford, so that it will be a great unequal war for thee." "I swear to the god that the Ulstermen swear by," said Cuchulain, "I will break thee against a green stone of the ford; and thou shalt have no healing from me, if thou leavest me not." "I will in truth be a grey wolf against thee," said she, "and I will strip a stripe' from thee, from thy right (hand) till it extends to thy left."</P>
<P>"I will beat thee from me," said he, "with the spear, till thy left or thy right eye bursts from thy head, and thou shalt never have healing from me, if thou leavest me not."

Who like thee in his wars is victorious, who all of thy feats can perform,<BR>
As brave, and as great, and as glorious, as tireless as thou in a storm,<BR>

And thou, in such contest when toiling, a battle unequal shalt find."</P>
<P>"By my god now I swear, by the token that Ulstermen swear by," he cried;<BR>
"On a green stone by me shall be broken that eel, to the Ford if it glide:<BR>
From woe it shall ne'er be escaping, till it loose me, and pass on its way!"<BR>
{80} And she said: "As a wolf myself shaping, I will spring on thee, eager to slay,<BR>
I will tear thee; the flesh shall be rended from thy chest by the wolf's savage bite,<BR>
Till a strip be torn from thee, extended from the arm on thy left to thy right!<BR>
With blows that my spear-shaft shall deal thee," he said, "I will force thee to fly<BR>
Till thou quit me; my skill shall not heal thee, though bursts from thy head either eye!"<BR>
I will come then," she cried, "as a heifer, white-skinned, but with ears that are red,<BR>
At what time thou in fight shalt endeavour the blood of a hero to shed,<BR>

</I><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">GIVING THE CONCLUSION OF THE "COURTSHIP OF ETAIN"</H3>
<P>{p. 145}</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>THE following pages give, with an interlinear word for word[1] translation, the text of Leabhar na h-Uidhri, page 130 <I>b</I>. line 19 to the end of page 132 <I>a</I>. of the facsimile. The text corresponds to the end of the tale of the Court ship of Etain in vol. i., from page 27, line 21, to the end of the story; it also contains the poem which is in that volume placed on page 26, but occurs in the manuscript at the place where the first line of it is quoted on page 30 of vol. i.</P>
<P>It is hoped that the text may be found to be convenient by scholars: special care has been taken to make it accurate, and it has not, with the exception of the poem just referred to, been published before except in the facsimile; the remainder of the text of the L.U. version of the Courtship of Etain, together with the poem, has been given by Windisch in the first volume of the <I>Irische Texte</I>.</P>
<P>The immediate object of the publication of this text, with its interlinear translation, is however somewhat different; it was desired to give any who may have become interested in the subject, from the romances contained in the two volumes of this collection, some idea of their exact form in the original, and of the Irish constructions and metres, as no Irish scholarship is needed to follow the text, when supplemented by the interlinear translation. The translation may be relied on, except for a few words indicated by a mark of interrogation.</P>
<P>The passage is especially well suited to give an idea of the style of Irish composition, as it contains all the three forms used in the romances, rhetoric, regular verse, and prose: the prose also is varied in character, for it includes narrative, rapid dialogue, an antiquarian insertion, and two descriptive</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Irish idiom of putting the adjective after the noun is not always followed in the translation.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 146}</P>
<P>passages. The piece of antiquarian information and the <I>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</I> of the old legend immediately preceding the second <I>rhetoric</I> can be seen to be of a different character to the flowing form of the narrative proper; the inserted passage being full of explanatory words, <I>conid</I>, <I>issairi</I>, <I>is aice</I>, &amp;c., and containing no imagery. The two descriptions, though short, are good examples of two styles of description which occur in some other romances; neither of these styles is universal, nor are they the only styles; the favour shown to one or the other in a romance may be regarded as a characteristic of its author.</P>
<P>The first style, exemplified by the description of Mider's appearance, consists of a succession of images presented in short sentences, sometimes, as in this case, with no verb, sometimes with the verb <I>bat&aacute;r</I> or a similar verb repeated in each sentence, but in all cases giving a brilliant word-picture, absolutely clear and definite, of what it is intended to convey. The second style, exemplified here by the description of the horses that Mider offers to Eochaid, consists of a series of epithets or of substantives, and is often imitated in modern Irish. These passages are usually difficult to translate, as many words appear to be coined for the purpose of the descriptions; but, in the best writings, the epithets are by no means arbitrary; they are placed so as to contrast sharply with each other, and in many cases suggest brilliant metaphors; the style being in this respect more like Latin than English. Absolutely literal translations quite fail to bring out the effect of such passages; for not only is the string of adjectives a distinctively Irish feature, but both in English and in Greek such metaphors are generally expressed more definitely and by short sentences. There is also a third style of description which does not appear in the prose of any of the romances in this collection, but appears often in other romances, as in the Bruidne da Derga, Bricriu's Feast, and the Great Tain; it resembles the first style, but the sentences are longer, yet it does not give clear descriptions, only leaving a vague impression. This style is often used for descriptions of the supernatural; it may be regarded as actual reproductions of the oldest pre-Christian work, but it is also possible that it is the result of legends, dimly known to the authors of the tales, and represented by them in the half-understood way in which they were apprehended by them: the Druidic forms may have been much more clear. Such passages are those</P>
<P>{p. 147}</P>
<P>which describe Cuchulain's distortions; the only passage of the character in this collection is in the verse of the Sick-bed, vol. i. page 77. Five of the romances in the present collection have no descriptive passages in the prose; the Combat at the Ford and the Tain bo Fraich show examples of both the first and the second form, but more often the first; the Tain bo Regamna, though a very short piece, also shows one example of each; for the description of the goblins met by Cuchulain is quite clear, and cannot be regarded as belonging to the third form. There is also one case of the second form in the Tain bo Dartada, and two other cases of the first in the Court ship of Etain-one in the Egerton, one in the Leabhar na h-Uidhri version. The best example of the first style is in the Egerton version of Etain (vol. i. page 12); the best example of the second is the description of Cuchulain's horses (vol. i. page 128); a still better example of contrasts in such a description is in the Courtship of Ferb (Nutt, page 23).</P>
<P>The piece of regular verse contained in the extract should give a fair idea of the style of this form of composition. Description is common in the verse, and it is in this case a prominent feature. It may be noted that lines 8, 16, 23, 26 will not scan unless the present diphthongs are divided, also that the poem has fewer internal rhymes than is usual in this regular verse.</P>
<P>The two passages in rhetoric, for so I take them to be, are good examples of the style. An attempt has been made to divide them into lines, but this division is open to criticism, especially as some lines in one of the two passages cannot be translated, and the translation of some other lines is doubtful: the division suggested does, however, appear to me to give a rough metre and occasional rhymes. It is possible that, if attention is called to those lines which are at present untranslatable, something may be done for them. The verse translations given in vol. i. pages 27 and 29, give the meaning that I take the Irish to bear where I can get any meaning at all.</P>
<P>As to the text, the usual abbreviation for <I>n</I> has in general not been italicized, nor has that for <I>fri</I>; all other abbreviations, including <I>acht</I>, final <I>n</I> in the symbol for <I>con</I>, and that for <I>or</I> in the recognized symbol for <I>for</I>, have been italicized. In the <I>rhetorics</I>, owing to their difficulty, the abbreviation for <I>n</I> has been italicized throughout; the symbol for <I>ocus</I> is not italicised. A few conjectures have been inserted, the text being given as a foot-note; a</P>

<P>conjectured letter supposed to be missing has been inserted in brackets, and a restoration by Professor Strachan of a few letters where the MS. is torn are similarly placed in brackets.

<P>[1. A conjecture by Windisch. Text gives slu&aacute;ig the genitive singular, which does not rhyme.</P>
<P>2 The three glosses are interesting. It may be noted that the last two certainly follow the word (above the line in which it occurs) that they seem to gloss: it is therefore probable that the first does so too; the two lines of a couplet are on the same line in the manuscript. It {footnote p. 156} seems then possible that the gloss "it is many-coloured" refers, not to the foxglove, but to the preceding line, "the colour of eyes is number of our hosts," and that the writer of this gloss gave the same meaning to the rather hard description of the colour of the eyes as is given in the verse translation (vol. i. p. 26), <I>i.e.</I> that the eyes had changing lights and shapes. We must hope, for the credit of his taste, that he did not think of the cheeks as many-coloured or freckled, but his gloss of <I>lossa</I> does not seem happy. The meaning "growth" is taken from O'Reilly's Dictionary.]</P>
