<I><P>A tile, a tree, and a coat of mail</I>. By the <I>fueros</I> of Biscay the eldest son inherited all the property, leaving to the other brothers only the mail as a knight: a tree, to signify, no doubt, the deeply-rooted family stock of nobility, and a tile, as representing the family house. P. <A HREF="lbp16.htm#page_249">249</A>.</P>
<I><P>Achular</I>. A mountain of Guipuzcoa, close to Andoain. There is another of the same name in the valley of Lerin, in Navarre. P. <A HREF="lbp11.htm#page_206">206</A>.</P>
<I><P>Aitz-belz</I>. <I>The black cliff</I>. By this name is known a mountain of Mendaro, in which there is a chasm so deep that the people believe that it ends in the bottomless pit of hell. P. <A HREF="lbp16.htm#page_250">250</A>.</P>
<I><P>Aitzgorri</I>. Mountain of Guipuzcoa: a continuation of Alo&ntilde;a. It rises 1&#183;800 metres above the level of the sea. P. <A HREF="lbp14.htm#page_228">228</A>.</P>

<I><P>Alo&ntilde;a</I>. A mountain of Guipuzcoa, at whose southerly base is situated the magnificent town of O&ntilde;ate, where, for a long time during the seven years' civil war, the Infante Don Carlos de Bourbon, uncle of Isabella II., held his court. P. <A HREF="lbp15.htm#page_233">233</A>.</P>
<I><P>Amboto</I>. A very high cliff situated on the frontiers of Guipuzcoa, Alava, and Biscay. P. <A HREF="lbp14.htm#page_228">228</A>.</P>
<I><P>Aquelarre</I>. A word composed of <I>larre</I>, pasture land, and <I>Aquerra</I>, buck goat; hence the word <I>Aquelarre</I> signifies the <I>pasture land of the goat</I>. It is well known that this animal figures in all the conventicles of witches as representing the Evil One. P. <A HREF="lbp04.htm#page_19">19</A>.</P>
<I><P>Ar&aacute;nzan, zu</I>. Literally, "You, in a thorn?" P. <A HREF="lbp15.htm#page_234">234</A>.</P>
<I><P>Ar&aacute;nzanzu, Convent of</I>. Situated on the south-west of the Monte Alo&ntilde;a. The convent was under the invocation of Our Lady of Ar&aacute;nzanzu, and was inhabited by the friars of the Order of St. Francis. The situation of this convent was very remarkable. It was cast, so to say, on the highest point and most rugged and bare of the mountain, on the height of a steep declivity, and from this may be inferred the daring and solidity of that capricious construction, Throughout the three Basque provinces the holy image of Our Lady of Ar&aacute;nzanzu was very famous, and the devotion of the people for it, even in our days, very general. During the month of May it is visited by numerous pilgrimages, and nothing more fantastic can be imagined than the effect produced by the glare of the fires at night, which are lit by the multitudes encamped on the mountain, as they are unable to</P>
<P><A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A></P>
<P>find accommodation for all in the spacious inns close to the convent, and to listen to the echoes of the magnificent organ, instrumental orchestra, and large choir of voices, as they celebrate the praises of the Virgin and intoned the prayers. The convent was only visible at a distance of about fifty metres. I am sorry to add that this singular construction was set fire to by order of General Rodil, during the civil war against Don Carlos--a deed of barbarism which will always merit reprehension and condemnation. P. <A HREF="lbp15.htm#page_234">234</A>.</P>

<I><P>Basso-jaun</I>. Literally translated it signifies the <I>Lord of the Woods</I>. The superstitious imagination of the Basques depicts him as a horrible monster in human form, covered with hair, and having nails long and hard as those</P>
<P><A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A></P>
<P>of a wild boar. It is supposed to reside in the deepest part of the woods, and occasionally it appears at the mouths of caverns and in mountain torrents. Very curious are the details which are given concerning this popular belief, by M. Michel, in his work entitled "Le Pais Basque," p. 154. P. <A HREF="lbp03.htm#page_3">3</A>, and <A HREF="lbp03.htm#page_17">p. 17</A> of Introduction.</P>
<I><P>Bego&ntilde;a</I>. The church of Bego&ntilde;a stands in the neighbourhood of Bilbao, on the eminence of Artagan, which overlooks the town.. It is one of the most renowned temples of these provinces. The present temple was constructed at the commencement of the sixteenth century, but from time immemorial the Virgin Mary has been venerated there under the invocation of Santa Maria de Bego&ntilde;a. Tradition tells us that its miraculous image appeared on that spot, and, on endeavouring to erect a church on the summit of the mountain, they went in procession to conduct the image to the place where they intended to build the edifice, but they heard a mysterious voice which said, <I>Bego-o&ntilde;a</I> ("Keep still"), and from this voice was the name given of Bego&ntilde;a.

<I><P>Cadag&uuml;a</I>. This is the most powerful river of Biscay, after that of Ibaizabal. It has its origin in the highest part of the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A></P>
<P>vale of Mena, which anciently belonged to Biscay, and at the present day to Burgos. It flows along the Encartaciones of Biscay, and joins the Ibaizabal about a league below Bilbao. P. <A HREF="lbp09.htm#page_166">166</A>.</P>

P. <A HREF="lbp11.htm#page_210">210</A>.</P>
<I><P>Covadonga</I>, <I>Navas</I>, and <I>Salado</I>. Three famous sanguinary battles, in which the Moors were routed: in these the Basque legions took an active part. P. <A HREF="lbp14.htm#page_230">230</A>.</P>
<I><P>Dalmatic</I>. A very rich robe embroidered with gold spangles, worn over tunics of white wool on great festivals by the ancient Euscaros in olden times. This dalmatic was used</P>
<P><A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A></P>
<P>as a sign of authority. The shape of this robe is exactly as the vestments worn during High Mass by the officiating deacon and sub-deacon, with the sole difference that the dalmatic has a hood.

<I><P>Eskaldunac</I>. Some authors write it <I>Escualdunac</I> (from <I>escua</I>, hand, <I>alde</I>, right, <I>dunac</I>, those who have), a name which the Biscayans, or Basque people, give to themselves. In their dialect they call themselves Euskarians. This dialect, the wise Humboldt considered, was the most remarkable language of all he was acquainted with. P. <A HREF="lbp08.htm#page_156">156</A>.</P>
<I><P>Esquiroz</I>. A mountain situated in Navarre, on the confines of Bardena Real. P. <A HREF="lbp11.htm#page_206">206</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A></P>
<I><P>Gara-paita</I>. <I>The collecting of the brake fern</I>. This is a rustic agricultural work in which all the neighbours and relatives join the landowner. It generally lasts several days, and each evening, when the day's labour is over, the young people amuse themselves with music, dancing, and love-making; while the old people spend the time in games, or recounting tales or ballads. In this way they convert what would otherwise be a laborious work into a regular country feast. P. <A HREF="lbp16.htm#page_248">248</A>.</P>
<I><P>Gorbea</I>. A mountain of Alava, which overlooks the plain upon which stands the city of Vitoria. P. <A HREF="lbp14.htm#page_228">228</A>.</P>

<I><P>Guernic&aacute;co Arbola</I>. The Tree of Guernica. This is one of the patriotic songs dedicated to the tree of Basque liberties, which is close to the town of Guernica, in Biscay. The actual tree is nearly a century old, since it was only thirty years old when its predecessor fell down from old age in 1811, and that one numbered more than three hundred years when it fell. Its trunk, says Iturriza, at the end of last century, was fifteen feet in circumference. The origin of this symbolical tree of the Basque liberties dates back to the origin of the Biscayan society. The statute tree is perpetuated like the Euskarian family, and is succeeded by its scions. The general <I>juntas</I> are materially inaugurated under the tree, and are continued in the juridical church of Santa Maria la Antigua,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A></P>
<P>placed also materially under the shadow of the statute oak. The actual tree is robust and beautiful, notwithstanding that it was greatly injured in 1830 or 1850 by the erection of the building intended for the general archive of the province. The tree which is to substitute the present one was planted a few years ago. Poetry and oratory have many times enthusiastically saluted the Tree of Guernica. The philosopher of Geneva sent it his blessing. Tallien saluted it in the midst of the French Convention, and many Spanish poets have written charming odes to the tree. The lords of Biscay took their oaths seated on a stone bench placed at the foot of the tree. It was on that spot that the Catholic Kings Ferdinand and Isabella sat, as also other monarchs. There is a patriotic song dedicated to the tree, and runs as follows</P><DIR>

<P>crucified on the summit of the mountains, with the object of inspiring the dwellers with terror.

<I><P>Left hand of a child, The</I>. It was a general belief among the mountain dwellers of the Basque provinces that the left hand of a child, if severed during sleep, and wrapped round with curls of its own hair, became a valuable amulet, which would deliver them of every kind of danger, and with it philters of different properties could also be made. There yet exists some among the rude inhabitants of the mountains of Roncal who foster this superstitious belief, although examples are unknown of this cruel mutilation ever having been effected, unless by the artifice of <I>gipsies</I>, <I>agotes</I>, or Jews in very remote ages, as there still exists evidence of severe provisions having been adopted against these barbarians. It was also a popular belief that the blood of children was useful for invigorating the weak bodies of women. P. <A HREF="lbp06.htm#page_88">88</A>.</P>

<I><P>Maitagarri</I>. Among the Basque people this is a fairy, or hade, which inhabits the lakes, and corresponds to the "Peri," or the Genius of the Persians. According to the legend, or popular tradition, this fairy, or hade, fell in love with a shepherd called Luzaide, and she took him to the summit of Ahu&ntilde;emendi, where she had her palace made of crystal. This legend evidently forms the basis of the narrative which the author gives in this chapter. P. <A HREF="lbp06.htm#page_80">80</A> and <A HREF="lbp06.htm#page_105">105</A>.</P>

<I><P>Padura</I>. A parochial district of Biscay. It was here that the natives completely routed the army of Ordo&ntilde;o the Wicked. At the present day this spot is known under the name of <I>Arrigorriaga</I> (Red stones), an appellation given to it, as tradition informs us, on account of the great quantity of blood which was spilt on the stones and imparted a red colour to them.
