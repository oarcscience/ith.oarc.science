<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">VARIATION OF 'THE GRATEFUL TARTARO AND THE HEREN-SUGE'</H3>
<P>In a variation of the above tale, from the narration of Marino Amyot, of St. Jean Pied de Port, the young prince, as a herdsman, kills with a hammer successively three Tartaros who play at cards with him; he then finds in their house all their riches and horses, barrels full of gold and silver, etc., and also three "<I>olano</I>," which is described as an animal who serves the Tartaro, like a dog, but much larger and more terrible, but also more intelligent and able to do any message. He kills the serpent with the aid of the "<I>olanos</I>," and the princess helps by striking the serpent's tail with a sword,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> instead of sprinkling the "sweet-scented water." The "<I>olano</I>" then steals dishes off the king's table for the prince. The charcoal-burner comes; but at last the prince shows the tongues and pieces of dress, and ill ends happily, except for the charcoal-burner, who is placed on the top of seven barrels of powder, and fire is applied beneath, and then nobody sees him any more.</P>
