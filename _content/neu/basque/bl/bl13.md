### VARIATION OF 'THE GRATEFUL TARTARO AND THE HEREN-SUGE'

In a variation of the above tale, from the narration of Marino Amyot, of
St. Jean Pied de Port, the young prince, as a herdsman, kills with a
hammer successively three Tartaros who play at cards with him; he then
finds in their house all their riches and horses, barrels full of gold
and silver, etc., and also three "*olano*," which is described as an
animal who serves the Tartaro, like a dog, but much larger and more
terrible, but also more intelligent and able to do any message. He kills
the serpent with the aid of the "*olanos*," and the princess helps by
striking the serpent's tail with a sword, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28) instead of sprinkling the "sweet-scented
water." The "*olano*" then steals dishes off the king's table for the
prince. The charcoal-burner comes; but at last the prince shows the
tongues and pieces of dress, and ill ends happily, except for the
charcoal-burner, who is placed on the top of seven barrels of powder,
and fire is applied beneath, and then nobody sees him any more.

The commencement of the next is so different that we give it at length.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_28"></span>[32:1](bl13.htm#fr_28) One of those present here
interrupted the reciter--"What did she hit the serpent on the *tail*
for?" "Why, to kill him, of course," was the reply; "ask Mr. Webster if
serpents are not killed by hitting them on the tail?"
