# A VOICE

ONE day I was walking over a bit of marshy ground close to Inchy Wood
when I felt, all of a sudden, and only for a second, an emotion which I
said to myself was the root of Christian mysticism. There had swept over
me a sense of weakness, of dependence on a great personal Being
somewhere far off yet near at hand. No thought of mine had prepared me
for this emotion, for I had been pre-occupied with Ængus and Edain, and
with Mannanan, son of the sea. That night I awoke lying upon my back and
hearing a voice speaking above me and saying, 'No human soul is like any
other human soul, and therefore the love of God for any human soul is
infinite, for no other soul can satisfy the same need in God.' A few
nights after this I awoke to see the loveliest people I have ever seen.
A young man and a young girl dressed in olive-green raiment, cut like
old Greek raiment, were

standing at my bedside. I looked at the girl and noticed that her dress
was gathered about her neck into a kind of chain, or perhaps into some
kind of stiff embroidery which represented ivy-leaves. But what filled
me with wonder was the miraculous mildness of her face. There are no
such faces now. It was beautiful, as few faces are beautiful, but it had
neither, one would think, the light that is in desire or in hope or in
fear or in speculation. It was peaceful like the faces of animals, or
like mountain pools at evening, so peaceful that it was a little sad. I
thought for a moment that she might be the beloved of Ængus, but how
could that hunted, alluring, happy, immortal wretch have a face like
this? Doubtless she was from among the children of the Moon, but who
among them I shall never know.
