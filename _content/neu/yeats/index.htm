William Butler Yeats
(born 1865, died 1939), a key figure in the Celtic literary revival at
the turn of the 20th Century, also moved in occult circles and knew
many of the key figures of the Golden Dawn.
He served as a Senator of the Irish free state and won
the Nobel prize for literature in 1923.

Note on copyrights: all of Yeats' books and other writings are copyrighted
in the UK and EU because he died in 1939, since their current copyright term
is death+70 years.
Therefore they will be covered by copyright in the UK and EU until 2009.
However, all of his writings prior to January 1st, 1923 are
in the public domain in the United States by the terms of the Digital
Millenium Copyright Act;
since sacred-texts is hosted in the US we abide by this criteria.
We have been careful only to use pre-1923 editions to produce these etexts.
Please take this into consideration if you plan to republish or post these
texts outside the US.
