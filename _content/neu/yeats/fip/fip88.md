### T'YEER-NA-N-OGE.--Page [200](fip52.htm#page_200).

"*Tír-na-n-óg*," Mr. Douglas Hyde writes, "'The Country of the Young',
is the place where the Irish peasant will tell you *geabhaedh tu an
sonas aer pighin*, 'you will get happiness for a penny', so cheap and
common it will be. It is sometimes, but not often, called
*Tir-na-hóige*; the 'Land of Youth'. Crofton Croker writes it,
*Thierna-na-noge*, which is an unfortunate mistake of his, *Thierna*
meaning a lord, not a country. This unlucky blunder is, like many others
of the same sort where Irish words are concerned, in danger of becoming
stereotyped, as the name of Iona has been, from mere clerical
carelessness."
