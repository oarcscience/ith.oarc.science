<P>Up the airy mountain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rushy glen,<BR>
We daren't go a-hunting<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear of little men;<BR>
Wee folk, good folk,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trooping all together;<BR>
Green jacket, red cap,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And white owl's feather!</P></DIR>

<P>Down along the rocky shore<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some make their home,<BR>
They live on crispy pancakes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of yellow tide-foam;<BR>
Some in the reeds<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the black mountain lake,<BR>
With frogs for their watch-dogs,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All night awake.</P>
<P>High on the hill-top<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The old King sits;<BR>
He is now so old and grey<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He's nigh lost his wits.<BR>
With a bridge of white mist<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbkill he crosses,<BR>
On his stately journeys<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From Slieveleague to Rosses;<BR>
Or going up with music<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On cold starry nights,<BR>
To sup with the Queen<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the gay Northern Lights.</P>
<P>They stole little Bridget<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For seven years long;<BR>
When she came down again<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her friends were all gone.<BR>
They took her lightly back,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the night and morrow,<BR>
They thought that she was fast asleep,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was dead with sorrow.<BR>
They have kept her ever since<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep within the lake,<BR>
On a bed of flag-leaves,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching till she wake.</P>
<P>By the craggy hill-side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the mosses bare,<BR>
They have planted thorn-trees<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For pleasure here and there. <A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A><BR>
Is any man so daring<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As dig them up in spite,<BR>
He shall find their sharpest thorns<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his bed at night.</P>
<P>Up the airy mountain,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the rushy glen,<BR>
We daren't go a-hunting<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear of little men;<BR>
Wee folk, good folk,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trooping all together;<BR>
Green jacket, red cap,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And white owl's feather!</P>
