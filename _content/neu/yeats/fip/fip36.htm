<P>I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night;<BR>
I went to the window to see the sight;<BR>
All the Dead that ever I knew<BR>
Going one by one and two by two.</P>
<P>On they pass'd, and on they pass'd;<BR>
Townsfellows all, from first to last;<BR>
Born in the moonlight of the lane,<BR>
Quench'd in the heavy shadow again.</P>
<P>Schoolmates, marching as when we play'd<BR>
At soldiers once--but now more staid;<BR>
Those were the strangest sight to me<BR>
Who were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea.</P></DIR>

<P>Straight and handsome folk; bent and weak, too;<BR>
Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to;<BR>
Some but a day in their churchyard bed;<BR>
Some that I had not known were dead.</P>
<P>A long, long crowd--where each seem'd lonely,<BR>
Yet of them all there was one, one only,<BR>
Raised a head or look'd my way.<BR>
She linger'd a moment,--she might not stay.</P>
<P>How long since I saw that fair pale face!<BR>
Ah! Mother dear! might I only place<BR>
My head on thy breast, a moment to rest,<BR>
While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest!</P>
<P>On, on, a moving bridge they made<BR>
Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade,<BR>
Young and old, women and men;<BR>
Many long-forgot, but remember'd then.</P>
<P>And first there came a bitter laughter;<BR>
A sound of tears the moment after;<BR>
And then a music so lofty and gay,<BR>
That every morning, day by day,<BR>
I strive to recall it if I may.</P>
