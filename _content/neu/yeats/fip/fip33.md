### A LAMENTATION

For the Death of Sir Maurice Fitzgerald, Knight, of Kerry, who was
killed in Flanders, 1642.

FROM THE IRISH, BY CLARENCE MANGAN

There was lifted up one voice of woe,  
  One lament of more than mortal grief,  
Through the wide South to and fro,  
  For a fallen Chief.  
In the dead of night that cry thrilled through me,  
  I looked out upon the midnight air?  
My own soul was all as gloomy,  
  As I knelt in prayer.

O'er Loch Gur, that night, once--twice-yea, thrice--  
  Passed a wail of anguish for the Brave  
That half curled into ice  
  Its moon-mirroring wave.  
Then uprose a many-toned wild hymn in  
  Choral swell from Ogra's dark ravine,  
And Mogeely's Phantom Women  
  Mourned the Geraldine!

Far on Carah Mona's emerald plains  
  Shrieks and sighs were blended many hours,  
And Fermoy in fitful strains  
  Answered from her towers.  
Youghal, Keenalmeaky, Eemokilly,  
  Mourned in concert, and their piercing *keen*  
Woke wondering life the stilly  
  Glens of Inchiqueen.

From Loughmoe to yellow Dunanore  
  There was fear; the traders of Tralee  
Gathered up their golden store,  
  And prepared to flee;  
For, in ship and hall from night till morning,  
  Showed the first faint beamings of the sun,  
All the foreigners heard the warning  
  Of the Dreaded One!

"This," they spake, "portendeth death to us,  
  If we fly not swiftly from our fate!  
Self-conceited idiots! thus  
  Ravingly to prate!  
Not for base-born higgling Saxon trucksters  
  Ring laments like those by shore and sea!  
Not for churls with souls like hucksters  
  Waileth our Banshee!

For the high Milesian race alone  
  Ever flows the music of her woe!  
For slain heir to bygone throne,  
  And for Chief laid low!  
Hark! ... Again, methinks, I hear her weeping  
  Yonder! is she near me now, as then?  
Or was but the night-wind sweeping  
  Down the hollow glen?
