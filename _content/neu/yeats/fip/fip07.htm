<P>Mournfully, sing mournfully-<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"O listen, Ellen, sister dear:<BR>
Is there no help at all for me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But only ceaseless sigh and tear?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did not he who left me here, <A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A><BR>
With stolen hope steal memory?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O listen, Ellen, sister dear,<BR>
(Mournfully, sing mournfully)--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll go away to Sleamish hill,<BR>
I'll pluck the fairy hawthorn-tree,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the spirits work their will;<BR>
I care not if for good or ill,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So they but lay the memory<BR>
Which all my heart is haunting still!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mournfully, sing mournfully)--<BR>
The Fairies are a silent race,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And pale as lily flowers to see;<BR>
I care not for a blanched face,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For wandering in a dreaming place,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I but banish memory:--<BR>
I wish I were with Anna Grace!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mournfully, sing mournfully!</P>
<P>Hearken to my tale of woe--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas thus to weeping Ellen Con,<BR>
Her sister said in accents low,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her only sister, Una bawn:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas in their bed before the dawn,<BR>
And Ellen answered sad and slow,--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh Una, Una, be not drawn<BR>
(Hearken to my tale of woe)--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To this unholy grief I pray,<BR>
Which makes me sick at heart to know,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will help you if I may:<BR>
--The Fairy Well of Lagnanay--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie nearer me, I tremble so,--<BR>
Una, I've heard wise women say<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hearken to my tale of woe)--<BR>
That if before the dews arise,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;True maiden in its icy flow<BR>
With pure hand bathe her bosom thrice,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three lady-brackens pluck likewise, <A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A><BR>
And three times round the fountain go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She straight forgets her tears and sighs."<BR>
Hearken to my tale of woe!</P>
<P>All, alas! and well-away!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, sister Ellen, sister sweet,<BR>
Come with me to the hill I pray,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will prove that blessed freet!"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They rose with soft and silent feet,<BR>
They left their mother where she lay,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mother and her care discreet,<BR>
(All, alas and well-away!)<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon they reached the Fairy Well,<BR>
The mountain's eye, clear, cold and grey,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide open in the dreary fell:<BR>
How long they stood 'twere vain to tell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At last upon the point of day,<BR>
Bawn Una bares her bosom's swell,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(All, alas and well-away!)<BR>
Thrice o'er her shrinking breasts she laves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gliding glance that will not stay<BR>
Of subtly-streaming fairy waves:--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the charm three brackens craves,<BR>
She plucks them in their fring'd array:--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now round the well her fate she braves,<BR>
All, alas! and well-away!</P>
<P>Save us all from Fairy thrall!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellen sees her face the rim<BR>
Twice and thrice, and that is all--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fount and hill and maiden swim<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All together melting dim!<BR>
"Una! Una!" thou may'st call,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister sad! but lith or limb<BR>
(Save us all from Fairy thrall! )<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never again of Una bawn, <A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A><BR>
Where now she walks in dreamy hall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall eye of mortal look upon!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! can it be the guard was gone,<BR>
The better guard than shield or wall?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows on earth save Jurlagh Daune?<BR>
(Save us all from Fairy thrall! )<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold the banks are green and bare,<BR>
No pit is here wherein to fall:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aye--at the fount you well may stare,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But nought save pebbles smooth is there,<BR>
And small straws twirling one and all.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hie thee home, and be thy pray'r,<BR>
Save us all from Fairy thrall.</P>
