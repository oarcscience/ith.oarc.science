### A LEGEND OF KNOCKMANY.--Page [266](fip69.htm#page_266)

Carleton says--"Of the grey stone mentioned in this legend, there is a
very striking and melancholy anecdote to be told. Some twelve or
thirteen years ago, a gentleman in the vicinity of the site of it was
building a house, and, in defiance of the legend and curse connected
with it, he resolved to break it up and use it. It was with some
difficulty, however, that he could succeed in getting his labourers to
have anything to do with its mutilation. Two men, however, undertook to
blast it, but, somehow, the process of ignition being mismanaged, it
exploded prematurely, and one of them was killed. This coincidence was
held as a fulfilment of the curse mentioned in the legend. I have heard
that it remains in that mutilated state to the present day, no other
person being found who had the hardihood to touch it. This stone, before
it was disfigured, exactly resembled that which the country people term
a miscaun of butter, which is precisely the shape of a complete prism, a
circumstance, no doubt, which, in the fertile imagination of the old
Senachies, gave rise to the superstition annexed to it."
