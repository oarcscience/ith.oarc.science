<P>The Merrow, of if you write it in the Irish, <I>Moruadh</I> or <I>Mur&uacute;ghach</I>, from <I>muir</I>, sea, and <I>oigh</I>, a maid, is not uncommon, they say, on the wilder coasts. The fishermen do not like to see them, for it always means coming gales. The male <I>Merrows</I> (if you can use such a phrase--I have never heard the masculine of Merrow) have green teeth, green hair, pig's eyes, and red noses; but their women are beautiful, for all their fish tails and the little duck-like scale between their fingers. Sometimes they prefer, small blame to them, good-looking fishermen to their sea lovers. Near Bantry in the last century, there is said to have been a woman covered all over with scales like a fish, who was descended from such a marriage. Sometimes they come out of the sea, and wander about the shore in the shape of little hornless cows. They have, when in their own shape, a red cap, called a <I>cohullen druith</I>, usually covered with feathers. If this is stolen, they cannot again go down under the waves.</P>
<P>Red is the colour of magic in every country, and has been so from the very earliest times. The caps of fairies and magicians are well-nigh always red.</P>
