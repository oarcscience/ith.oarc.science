<I><P>Shoneen</I> is the diminutive of <I>shone</I> [Ir. <I>Se&oacute;n</I>]. There are two Irish names for John--one is <I>Shone</I>, the other is <I>Shawn</I> [Ir. <I>Se&aacute;ghan</I>]. Shone is the "grandest" of the two, and is applied to the gentry. Hence <I>Shoneen</I> means "a little gentry John", and is applied to upstarts and "big" farmers, who ape the rank of gentleman.</P>
<I><P>Sleiveen</I>, not to be found in the dictionaries, is a comical Irish word (at least in Connaught) for a rogue. It probably comes from <I>sliabh</I>, a mountain, meaning primarily a mountaineer, and in a secondary sense, on the principle that mountaineers are worse than anybody else, a rogue. I am indebted to Mr. Douglas Hyde for these details, as for many others.</P>
