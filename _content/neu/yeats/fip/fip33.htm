<P ALIGN="CENTER">FROM THE IRISH, BY CLARENCE MANGAN</P><DIR>

<P>There was lifted up one voice of woe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One lament of more than mortal grief,<BR>
Through the wide South to and fro,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a fallen Chief.<BR>
In the dead of night that cry thrilled through me,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked out upon the midnight air?<BR>
My own soul was all as gloomy,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I knelt in prayer.</P>
<P>O'er Loch Gur, that night, once--twice-yea, thrice--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed a wail of anguish for the Brave<BR>
That half curled into ice<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its moon-mirroring wave.<BR>
Then uprose a many-toned wild hymn in<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Choral swell from Ogra's dark ravine,<BR>
And Mogeely's Phantom Women<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourned the Geraldine!</P>
<P>Far on Carah Mona's emerald plains<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrieks and sighs were blended many hours,<BR>
And Fermoy in fitful strains<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Answered from her towers.<BR>
Youghal, Keenalmeaky, Eemokilly,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourned in concert, and their piercing <I>keen</I><BR>
Woke wondering life the stilly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Glens of Inchiqueen.</P></DIR>

<P>From Loughmoe to yellow Dunanore<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was fear; the traders of Tralee<BR>
Gathered up their golden store,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And prepared to flee;<BR>
For, in ship and hall from night till morning,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Showed the first faint beamings of the sun,<BR>
All the foreigners heard the warning<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Dreaded One!</P>
<P>"This," they spake, "portendeth death to us,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If we fly not swiftly from our fate!<BR>
Self-conceited idiots! thus<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravingly to prate!<BR>
Not for base-born higgling Saxon trucksters<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring laments like those by shore and sea!<BR>
Not for churls with souls like hucksters<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Waileth our Banshee!</P>
<P>For the high Milesian race alone<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever flows the music of her woe!<BR>
For slain heir to bygone throne,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Chief laid low!<BR>
Hark! ... Again, methinks, I hear her weeping<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder! is she near me now, as then?<BR>
Or was but the night-wind sweeping<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the hollow glen?</P>
