<P>Crouched round a bare hearth in hard, frosty weather,<BR>
Three lonely helpless weans cling close together;<BR>
Tangled those gold locks, once bonnie and bright--<BR>
There's no one to fondle the baby tonight.</P>
<P>"My mammie I want; oh! my mammie I want!<BR>
The big tears stream down with the low wailing chant.<BR>
Sweet Eily's slight arms enfold the gold head:<BR>
"Poor weeny Willie, sure mammie is dead--</P></DIR>

<P>And daddie is crazy from drinking all day--<BR>
Come down, holy angels, and take us away!<BR>
Eily and Eddie keep kissing and crying--<BR>
Outside, the weird winds are sobbing and sighing.</P>
<P>All in a moment the children are still,<BR>
Only a quick coo of gladness from Will.<BR>
The sheeling no longer seems empty or bare,<BR>
For, clothed in soft raiment, the mother stands there.</P>
<P>They gather around her, they cling to her dress;<BR>
She rains down soft kisses for each shy caress.<BR>
Her light, loving touches smooth out tangled locks,<BR>
And, pressed to her bosom, the baby she rocks.</P>
<P>He lies in his cot, there's a fire on the hearth;<BR>
To Eily and Eddy 'tis heaven on earth,<BR>
For mother's deft fingers have been everywhere;<BR>
She lulls them to rest in the low <I>suggaun</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> chair.</P>
<P>They gaze open-eyed, then the eyes gently close,<BR>
As petals fold into the heart of a rose,<BR>
But ope soon again in awe, love, but no fear,<BR>
And fondly they murmur, "Our mammie is here."</P>
<P>She lays them down softly, she wraps them around;<BR>
They lie in sweet slumbers, she starts at a sound,<BR>
The cock loudly crows, and the spirit's away--<BR>
The drunkard steals in at the dawning of day.</P>
<P>Again and again, 'tween the dark and the dawn,<BR>
Glides in the dead mother to nurse Willie Bawn:<BR>
Or is it an angel who sits by the hearth?<BR>
An angel in heaven, a mother on earth.</P>
