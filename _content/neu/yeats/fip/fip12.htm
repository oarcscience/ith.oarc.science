<P>"GET up, our Anna dear, from the weary spinning-wheel;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For your father's on the hill, and your mother is asleep;<BR>
Come up above the crags, and we'll dance a highland-reel<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the fairy thorn on the steep."</P>
<P>At Anna Grace's door 'twas thus the maidens cried,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three merry maidens fair in kirtles of the green;<BR>
And Anna laid the rock and the weary wheel aside,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairest of the four, I ween.</P>
<P>They're glancing through the glimmer of the quiet eve,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Away in milky wavings of neck and ankle bare;<BR>
The heavy-sliding stream in its sleepy song they leave,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crags in the ghostly air:</P>
<P>And linking hand in hand, and singing as they go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The maids along the hill-side have ta'en their fearless way,<BR>
Till they come to where the rowan trees in lonely beauty grow<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Fairy Hawthorn grey.</P></DIR>

<P>The Hawthorn stands between the ashes tall and slim,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like matron with her twin grand-daughters at her knee;<BR>
The rowan berries cluster o'er her low head grey and dim<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In ruddy kisses sweet to see.</P>
<P>The merry maidens four have ranged them in a row,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between each lovely couple a stately rowan stem,<BR>
And away in mazes wavy, like skimming birds they go,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, never caroll'd bird like them!</P>
<P>But solemn is the silence of the silvery haze<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That drinks away their voices in echoless repose,<BR>
And dreamily the evening has still'd the haunted braes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dreamier the gloaming grows.</P>
<P>And sinking one by one, like lark-notes from the sky<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the falcon's shadow saileth across the open shaw,<BR>
Are hush'd the maiden's voices, as cowering down they he<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flutter of their sudden awe.</P>
<P>For, from the air above, the grassy ground beneath,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the mountain-ashes and the old Whitethorn between,<BR>
A Power of faint enchantment doth through their beings breathe,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they sink down together on the green.</P>
<P>They sink together silent, and stealing side by side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They fling their lovely arms o'er their drooping necks so fair,<BR>
Then vainly strive again their naked arms to hide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For their shrinking necks again are bare.</P>
<P>Thus clasp'd and prostrate all, with their heads together bow'd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft o'er their bosom's beating--the only human sound--<BR>
They hear the silky footsteps of the silent fairy crowd,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a river in the air, gliding round.</P></DIR>

<P>No scream can any raise, no prayer can any say,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But wild, wild, the terror of the speechless three--<BR>
For they feel fair Anna Grace drawn silently away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By whom they dare not look to see.</P>
<P>They feel their tresses twine with her parting locks of gold<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the curls elastic falling as her head withdraws;<BR>
They feel her sliding arms from their tranced arms unfold,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But they may not look to see the cause:</P>
<P>For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze;<BR>
And neither fear nor wonder can ope their quivering eyes,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or their limbs from the cold ground raise,</P>
<P>Till out of night the earth has roll'd her dewy side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With every haunted mountain and streamy vale below;<BR>
When, as the mist dissolves in the yellow morning tide,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The maidens' trance dissolveth go.</P>
<P>Then fly the ghastly three as swiftly as they may,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell their tale of sorrow to anxious friends in vain--<BR>
They pined away and died within the year and day,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ne'er was Anna Grace seen again.</P>
