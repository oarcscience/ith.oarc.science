<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE OLD AGE OF QUEEN MAEVE.</H3>
<P>Maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro,<BR>
Between the walls covered with beaten bronze,<BR>
In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth,<BR>
Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed<BR>
Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes,<BR>
Or on the benches underneath the walls,<BR>
In comfortable sleep; all living slept<BR>
But that great queen, who more than half the night<BR>
Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.<BR>
Though now in her old age, in her young age<BR>
She had been beautiful in that old way<BR>
That's all but gone; for the proud heart is gone<BR>
And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all<BR>
But soft beauty and indolent desire.<BR>
She could have called over the rim of the world<BR>
Whatever woman's lover had hit her fancy,<BR>
And yet had been great bodied and great limbed,<BR>
Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;<BR>
And she'd had lucky eyes and a high heart,<BR>
And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax, <A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A><BR>
At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,<BR>
Sudden and laughing.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O unquiet heart,<BR>
Why do you praise another, praising her,<BR>
As if there were no tale but your own tale<BR>
Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?<BR>
Have I not bid you tell of that great queen<BR>
Who has been buried some two thousand years?</P>
<P>When night was at its deepest, a wild goose<BR>
Cried from the porter's lodge, and with long clamour<BR>
Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks;<BR>
But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power<BR>
Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;<BR>
And wondering who of the many changing Sidhe<BR>
Had come as in the old times to counsel her.,<BR>
Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall being old,<BR>
To that small chamber by the outer gate.<BR>
The porter slept although he sat upright<BR>
With still and stony limbs and open eyes.<BR>
Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise <A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A><BR>
Broke from his parted lips and broke again,<BR>
She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,<BR>
And shook him wide awake, and bid him say<BR>
Who of the wandering many-changing ones<BR>
Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say<BR>
Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs<BR>
More still than they had been for a good month,<BR>
He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing,<BR>
He could remember when he had had fine dreams.<BR>
It was before the time of the great war<BR>
Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.</P>
<P>She turned away; he turned again to sleep<BR>
That no god troubled now, and, wondering<BR>
What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,<BR>
Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh<BR>
Lifted the curtain of her sleeping room,<BR>
Remembering that she too had seemed divine<BR>
To many thousand eyes, and to her own <A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A><BR>
One that the generations had long-waited<BR>
That work too difficult for mortal hands<BR>
Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up<BR>
She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,<BR>
And thought of days when he'd had a straight body,<BR>
And of that famous Fergus, Nessa's husband,<BR>
Who had been the lover of her middle life.</P>
<P>Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,<BR>
And not with his own voice or a man's voice,<BR>
But with the burning, live, unshaken voice<BR>
Of those that it may be can never age.<BR>
He said, 'High Queen of Cruachan and Mag Ai<BR>
A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.'<BR>
And with glad voice Maeve answered him, 'What King<BR>
Of the far wandering shadows has come to me?<BR>
As in the old days when they would come and go<BR>
About my threshold to counsel and to help.'<BR>
The parted lips replied, 'I seek your help,<BR>
For I am Aengus and I am crossed in love.' <A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A><BR>
'How may a mortal whose life gutters out<BR>
Help them that wander with hand clasping hand<BR>
By rivers where nor rain nor hail has dimmed<BR>
Their haughty images, that cannot fade<BR>
Although their beauty's like a hollow dream.'</P>
<P>'I come from the undimmed rivers to bid you call<BR>
The children of the Maines out of sleep,<BR>
And set them digging into Anbual's hill.<BR>
We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,<BR>
Will overthrow his shadows and carry off<BR>
Caer, his blue eyed daughter that I love.<BR>
I helped your fathers when they built these walls<BR>
And I would have your help in my great need,<BR>
Queen of high Cruachan.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I obey your will<BR>
With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:<BR>
For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,<BR>
Our giver of good counsel and good luck.'<BR>
And with a groan, as if the mortal breath<BR>
Could but awaken sadly upon lips <A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A><BR>
That happier breath had moved, her husband turned<BR>
Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;<BR>
But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,<BR>
Came to the threshold of the painted house,<BR>
Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,<BR>
Until the pillared dark began to stir<BR>
With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.</P>
<P>She told them of the many-changing ones;<BR>
And all that night, and all through the next day<BR>
To middle night, they dug into the hill.<BR>
At middle night great cats with silver claws,<BR>
Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,<BR>
Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds<BR>
With long white bodies came out of the air<BR>
Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</P>
<P>The Maines' children dropped their spades, and stood<BR>
With quaking joints and terror strucken faces,<BR>
Till Maeve called out, 'These are but common men. <A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A><BR>
The Maines' children have not dropped their spades<BR>
Because Earth crazy for its broken power<BR>
Casts up a show and the winds answer it<BR>
With holy shadows.' Her high heart was glad,<BR>
And when the uproar ran along the grass<BR>
She followed with light footfall in the midst,<BR>
Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.</P>
<P>Friend of these many years, you too had stood<BR>
With equal courage in that whirling rout;<BR>
For you, although you've not her wandering heart,<BR>
Have all that greatness, and not hers alone.<BR>
For there is no high story about queens<BR>
In any ancient book but tells of you,<BR>
And when I've heard how they grew old and died<BR>
Or fell into unhappiness I've said;<BR>
'She will grow old and die and she has wept!'<BR>
And when I'd write it out anew, the words,<BR>
Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!<BR>
Outrun the measure. <A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd tell of that great queen<BR>
Who stood amid a silence by the thorn<BR>
Until two lovers came out of the air<BR>
With bodies made out of soft fire. The one<BR>
About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings<BR>
Said, 'Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks<BR>
To Maeve and to Maeve's household, owing all<BR>
In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.'<BR>
Then Maeve, 'O Aengus, Master of all lovers,<BR>
A thousand years ago you held high talk<BR>
With the first kings of many pillared Cruachan.<BR>
O when will you grow weary.'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had vanished,<BR>
But out of the dark air over her head there came<BR>
A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</P>
