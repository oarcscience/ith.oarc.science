<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ADAM'S CURSE.</H3>
<P>We sat together at one summer's end<BR>
That beautiful mild woman your close friend<BR>
And you and I, and talked of poetry.</P>
<P>I said 'a line will take us hours maybe,<BR>
Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought<BR>
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.<BR>
Better go down upon your marrow bones<BR>
And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones<BR>
Like an old pauper in all kinds of weather;<BR>
For to articulate sweet sounds together<BR>
Is to work harder than all these and yet<BR>
Be thought an idler by the noisy set<BR>
Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen<BR>
The martyrs call the world.' <A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That woman then<BR>
Murmured with her young voice, for whose mild sake<BR>
There's many a one shall find out all heartache<BR>
In finding that it's young and mild and low.<BR>
'There is one thing that all we women know<BR>
Although we never heard of it at school,<BR>
That we must labour to be beautiful.'</P>
<P>I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing<BR>
Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.<BR>
There have been lovers who thought love should be<BR>
So much compounded of high courtesy<BR>
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks<BR>
Precedents out of beautiful old books;<BR>
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'</P>
<P>We sat grown quiet at the name of love,<BR>
We saw the last embers of daylight die<BR>
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky<BR>
A moon, worn as if it had been a shell <A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A><BR>
Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell<BR>
About the stars and broke in days and years.</P>
<P>I had a thought for no one's but your ears<BR>
That you were beautiful and that I strove<BR>
To love you in the old high way of love<BR>
That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown<BR>
As weary hearted as that hollow moon.</P>
