<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SONG OF RED HANRAHAN.</H3>
<P>The old brown thorn trees break in two high over Cummen Strand<BR>
Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand,<BR>
Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies;<BR>
But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes<BR>
Of Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan.</P>
<P>The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knocknarea <A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A><BR>
And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say.<BR>
Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat;<BR>
But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet<BR>
Of Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan.</P>
<P>The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare,<BR>
For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air;<BR>
Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood;<BR>
But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood<BR>
Is Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan.</P>
