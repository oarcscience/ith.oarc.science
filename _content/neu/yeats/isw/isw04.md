### THE ARROW.

I thought of your beauty and this arrow  
Made out of a wild thought is in my marrow.  
There's no man may look upon her, no man,  
As when newly grown to be a woman,  
Blossom pale, she pulled down the pale blossom  
At the moth hour and hid it in her bosom.  
This beauty's kinder yet for a reason  
I could weep that the old is out of season.
