<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PLAYERS ASK FOR A BLESSING ON THE PSALTERIES AND THEMSELVES.</H3>
<P>Three Voices together<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry to bless the hands that play,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouths that speak, the notes and strings,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O masters of the glittering town!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O! lay the shrilly trumpet down,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though drunken with the flags that sway<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the ramparts and the towers,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the waving of your wings.<BR>
First Voice<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they linger by the way;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One gathers up his purple gown;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One leans and mutters by the wall;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He dreads the weight of mortal hours.<BR>
Second Voice<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O no, O no, they hurry down<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like plovers that have heard the call.<BR>
Third Voice<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, kinsmen of the Three in One, <A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, kinsmen bless the hands that play.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes they waken shall live on<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When all this heavy history's done.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hands, our hands must ebb away.<BR>
Three Voices together<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The proud and careless notes live on<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But bless our hands that ebb away.</P>
