<P>I have heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods<BR>
Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees<BR>
Hum in the lime tree flowers; and put away<BR>
The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness<BR>
That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile<BR>
Tara uprooted, and new commonness<BR>
Upon the throne and crying about the streets<BR>
And hanging its paper flowers from post to post,<BR>
Because it is alone of all things happy.<BR>
I am contented for I know that Quiet<BR>
Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart<BR>
Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer,<BR>
Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs<BR>
A cloudy quiver over Parc-na-Lee.</P>
