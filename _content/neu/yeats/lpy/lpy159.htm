<p>SHE that but little patience knew,<br> From childhood on, had now so much<br> A grey gull lost its fear and flew<br> Down to her cell and there alit,<br> And there endured her fingers' touch<br> And from her fingers ate its bit.</p>  
<p>Did she in touching that lone wing<br> Recall the years before her mind<br> Became a bitter, an abstract thing,<br> Her thought some popular enmity:<br> Blind and leader of the blind<br> Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?</p>  
<p>When long ago I saw her ride<br> Under Ben Bulben to the meet,<br> The beauty of her country-side<br> With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,<br> She seemed to have grown clean and sweet<br> Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:</p>  
<p>Sea-borne, or balanced on the air<br> When first it sprang out of the nest <A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A><br> Upon some lofty rock to stare<br> Upon the cloudy canopy,<br> While under its storm-beaten breast<br> Cried out the hollows of the sea.</p>
