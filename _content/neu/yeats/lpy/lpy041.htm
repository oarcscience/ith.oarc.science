<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><i>Argument</i>. Baile and Aillinn were   lovers, but Aengus, the Master of Love, wishing them to be happy in his own   land among the dead, told to each a story of the other's death, so that their   hearts were broken and they died.</FONT></p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  </div>  
<p><i>I HARDLY hear the curlew cry,<br> Nor the grey rush when the wind is high,<br> Before my thoughts begin to run<br> On the heir of Ulad, Buan's son,<br> Baile, who had the honey mouth;<br> And that mild woman of the south,<br> Aillinn, who was King Lugaid's heir.<br> Their love was never drowned in care<br> Of this or that thing, nor grew cold<br> Because their bodies had grown old.<br> Being forbid to marry on earth,<br> They blossomed to immortal mirth</i>.</p>  
<p>About the time when Christ was born,<br> When the long wars for the White Horn<br> And the Brown Bull had not yet come,<br> Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some<br> Called rather Baile Little-Land,<br> Rode out of Emain with a band<br> Of harpers and young men; and they<br> Imagined, as they struck the way <A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A><br> To many-pastured Muirthemne,<br> That all things fell out happily,<br> And there, for all that fools had said,<br> Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</p>  
<p>They found an old man running there:<br> He had ragged long grass-coloured hair;<br> He had knees that stuck out of his hose;<br> He had puddle water in his shoes;<br> He had half a cloak to keep him dry,<br> Although he had a squirrel's eye.</p>  
<p><i>O wandering birds and rushy beds,<br> You put such folly in our heads<br> With all this crying in the wind;<br> No common love is to our mind,<br> And our poor Kate or Nan is less<br> Than any whose unhappiness<br> Awoke the harp-strings long ago.<br> Yet they that know all things but know<br> That all life had to give us is<br> A child's laughter, a woman's kiss.<br> Who was it put so great a scorn<br> In the grey reeds that night and morn<br> Are trodden and broken by the herds,<br> And in the light bodies of birds<br> That north wind tumbles to and fro<br> And pinches among hail and snow?</i>&nbsp;<i></i></p>  
<p>That runner said: "I am from the south;<br> I run to Baile Honey-Mouth, <A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A><br> To tell him how the girl Aillinn<br> Rode from the country of her kin,<br> And old and young men rode with her:<br> For all that country had been astir<br> If anybody half as fair<br> Had chosen a husband anywhere<br> But where it could see her every day.<br> When they had ridden a little way<br> An old man caught the horse's head<br> With: 'You must home again, and wed<br> With somebody in your own land.'<br> A young man cried and kissed her hand,<br> 'O lady, wed with one of us';<br> And when no face grew piteous<br> For any gentle thing she spake,<br> She fell and died of the heart-break."</p>  
<p>Because a lover's heart's worn out,<br> Being tumbled and blown about<br> By its own blind imagining,<br> And will believe that anything<br> That is bad enough to be true, is true,<br> Baile's heart was broken in two;<br> And he being laid upon green boughs,<br> Was carried to the goodly house<br> Where the Hound of Ulad sat before<br> The brazen pillars of his door,<br> His face bowed low to weep the end<br> Of the harper's daughter and her friend.<br> For although years had passed away<br> He always wept them on that day, <A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A><br> For on that day they had been betrayed;<br> And now that Honey-Mouth is laid<br> Under a cairn of sleepy stone<br> Before his eyes, he has tears for none,<br> Although he is carrying stone, but two<br> For whom the cairn's but heaped anew.</p>  
<p><i>We hold because our memory is<br> So full of that thing and of this<br> That out of sight is out of mind.<br> But the grey rush under the wind<br> And the grey bird with crooked bill<br> Have such long memories, that they still<br> Remember Deirdre and her man;<br> And when we walk with Kate or Nan<br> About the windy water side,<br> Our heart can hear the voices chide.<br> How could we be so soon content,<br> Who know the way that Naoise went<br> And they have news of Deirdre's eyes,<br> Who being lovely was so wise--<br> Ah! wise, my heart knows well how wise</i>.</p>  
<p>Now had that old gaunt crafty one,<br> Gathering his cloak about him, run<br> Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids,<br> Who amid leafy lights and shades<br> Dreamed of the hands that would unlace<br> Their bodices in some dim place<br> When they had come to the marriage bed;<br> And harpers, pacing with high head <A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A><br> As though their music were enough<br> To make the savage heart of love<br> Grow gentle without sorrowing,<br> Imagining and pondering<br> Heaven knows what calamity;</p>  
<p>"Another's hurried off," cried he,<br> From heat and cold and wind and wave;<br> They have heaped the stones above his grave<br> In Muirthemne, and over it<br> In changeless Ogham letters writ--<br> <i>Baile, that was of Rury's seed</i>.<br> But the gods long ago decreed<br> No waiting maid should ever spread<br> Baile and Aillinn's marriage bed,<br> For they should clip and clip again<br> Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.<br> Therefore it is but little news<br> That put this hurry in my shoes."</p>  
<p>Then seeing that he scarce had spoke<br> Before her love-worn heart had broke,<br> He ran and laughed until he came<br> To that high hill the herdsmen name<br> The Hill Seat of Leighin, because<br> Some god or king had made the laws<br> That held the land together there,<br> In old times among the clouds of the air.</p>  
<p>That old man climbed; the day grew dim;<br> Two swans came flying up to him, <A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A><br> Linked by a gold chain each to each,<br> And with low murmuring laughing speech<br> Alighted on the windy grass.<br> They knew him: his changed body was<br> Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings<br> Were hovering over the harp-strings<br> That Etain, Midhir's wife, had wove<br> In the hid place, being crazed by love.</p>  
<p>What shall I call them? fish that swim,<br> Scale rubbing scale where light is dim<br> By a broad water-lily leaf;<br> Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf<br> Forgotten at the threshing place;<br> Or birds lost in the one clear space<br> Of morning light in a dim sky;<br> Or, it may be, the eyelids of one eye,<br> Or the door pillars of one house,<br> Or two sweet blossoming apple-boughs<br> That have one shadow on the ground;<br> Or the two strings that made one sound<br> Where that wise harper's finger ran.<br> For this young girl and this young man<br> Have happiness without an end,<br> Because they have made so good a friend.</p>  
<p>They know all wonders, for they pass<br> The towery gates of Gorias,<br> And Findrias and Falias,<br> And long-forgotten Murias,<br> Among the giant kings whose hoard, <A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A><br> Cauldron and spear and stone and sword,<br> Was robbed before earth gave the wheat;<br> Wandering from broken street to street<br> They come where some huge watcher is,<br> And tremble with their love and kiss.</p>  
<p>They know undying things, for they<br> Wander where earth withers away,<br> Though nothing troubles the great streams<br> But light from the pale stars, and gleams<br> From the holy orchards, where there is none<br> But fruit that is of precious stone,<br> Or apples of the sun and moon.</p>  
<p>What were our praise to them? They eat<br> Quiet's wild heart, like daily meat;<br> Who when night thickens are afloat<br> On dappled skins in a glass boat,<br> Far out under a windless sky;<br> While over them birds of Aengus fly,<br> And over the tiller and the prow,<br> And waving white wings to and fro<br> Awaken wanderings of light air<br> To stir their coverlet and their hair.</p>  
<p>And poets found, old writers say,<br> A yew tree where his body lay;<br> But a wild apple hid the grass<br> With its sweet blossom where hers was;<br> And being in good heart, because<br> A better time had come again <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A><br> After the deaths of many men,<br> And that long fighting at the ford,<br> They wrote on tablets of thin board,<br> Made of the apple and the yew,<br> All the love stories that they knew.</p>  
<p><i>Let rush and bird cry out their fill<br> Of the harper's daughter if they will,<br> Beloved, I am not afraid of her.<br> She is not wiser nor lovelier,<br> And you are more high of heart than she,<br> For all her wanderings over-sea;<br> But I'd have bird and rush forget<br> Those other two; for never yet<br> Has lover lived, but longed to wive<br> Like them that are no more alive</i>.</p>
