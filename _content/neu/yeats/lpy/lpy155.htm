<p>Do not because this day I have grown saturnine<br> Imagine that lost love, inseparable from my thought<br> Because I .have no other youth, can make me pine;<br> For how should I forget the wisdom that you brought,<br> The comfort that you made? Although my wits have gone<br> On a fantastic ride, my horse's flanks are spurred<br> By childish memories of an old cross Pollexfen,<br> And of a Middleton, whose name you never heard,<br> And of a red-haired Yeats whose looks, although he died<br> Before my time, seem like a vivid memory.<br> You heard that labouring man who had served my people. He said<br> Upon the open road, near to the Sligo quay--<br> No, no, not said, but cried it out--"You have come again <A NAME="page_333"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 333</FONT></A><br> And surely after twenty years it was time to come."<br> I am thinking of a child's vow sworn in vain<br> Never to leave that valley his fathers called their home.</p>
