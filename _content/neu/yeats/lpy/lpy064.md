### KING AND NO KING

"WOULD it were anything but merely voice!"  
The No King cried who after that was King,  
Because he had not heard of anything  
That balanced with a word is more than noise;  
Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail  
Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,  
Though he'd but cannon--Whereas we that had thought  
To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale  
Have been defeated by that pledge you gave  
In momentary anger long ago;  
And I that have not your faith, how shall I know  
That in the blinding light beyond the grave  
We'll find so good a thing as that we have lost?  
The hourly kindness, the day's common speech,  
The habitual content of each with each  
When neither soul nor body has been crossed.
