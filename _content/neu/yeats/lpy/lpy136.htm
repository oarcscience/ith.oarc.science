<p>THERE is grey in your hair.<br> Young men no longer suddenly catch their breath<br> When you are passing;<br> But maybe some old gaffer mutters a blessing<br> Because it was your prayer<br> Recovered him upon the bed of death.<br> For your sole sake--that all heart's ache have known,<br> And given to others all heart's ache,<br> From meagre girlhood's putting on<br> Burdensome beauty--for your sole sake<br> Heaven has put away the stroke of her doom,<br> So great her portion in that peace you make<br> By merely walking in a room.</p>  
<p>Your beauty can but leave among us<br> Vague memories, nothing but memories.<br> A young man when the old men are done talking<br> Will say to an old man, "Tell me of that lady <A NAME="page_282"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 282</FONT></A><br> The poet stubborn with his passion sang us<br> When age might well have chilled his blood."</p>  
<p>Vague memories, nothing but memories,<br> But in the grave all, all, shall be renewed.<br> The certainty that I shall see that lady<br> Leaning or standing or walking<br> In the first loveliness of womanhood,<br> And with the fervour of my youthful eyes,<br> Has set me muttering like a fool.</p>  
<p>You are more beautiful than any one<br> And yet your body had a flaw:<br> Your small hands were not beautiful,<br> And I am afraid that you will run<br> And paddle to the wrist<br> In that mysterious, always brimming lake<br> Where those that have obeyed the holy law<br> Paddle and are perfect; leave unchanged<br> The hands that I have kissed<br> For old sakes' sake.</p>  
<p>The last stroke of midnight dies.<br> All day in the one chair<br> From dream to dream and rhyme to rhyme I have ranged<br> In rambling talk with an image of air:<br> Vague memories, nothing but memories.</p>
