<p>THE cat went here and there<br> And the moon spun round like a top,<br> And the nearest kin of the moon<br> The creeping cat looked up.<br> Black Minnaloushe stared at the moon,<br> For wander and wail as he would<br> The pure cold light in the sky<br> Troubled his animal blood.<br> Minnaloushe runs in the grass<br> Lifting his delicate feet.<br> Do you dance, Minnaloushe, do you dance?<br> When two close kindred meet<br> What better than call a dance,<br> Maybe the moon may learn,<br> Tired of that courtly fashion,<br> A new dance turn.<br> Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br> From moonlit place to place,<br> The sacred moon overhead<br> Has taken a new phase.<br> Does Minnaloushe know that his pupils<br> Will pass from change to change,<br> And that from round to crescent, <A NAME="page_311"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 311</FONT></A><br> From crescent to round they range?<br> Minnaloushe creeps through the grass<br> Alone, important and wise,<br> And lifts to the changing moon<br> His changing eyes.</p>
