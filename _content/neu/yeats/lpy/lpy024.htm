<p>IF this importunate heart trouble your peace<br> With words lighter than air,<br> Or hopes that in mere hoping flicker and cease;<br> Crumple the rose in your hair;<br> And cover your lips with odorous twilight and say,<br> "O Hearts of wind-blown flame!<br> O Winds, elder than changing of night and day,<br> That murmuring and longing came,<br> From marble cities loud with tabors of old<br> In dove-grey faery lands;<br> From battle banners, fold upon purple fold,<br> Queens wrought with glimmering hands;<br> That saw young Niamh hover with love-lorn face<br> Above the wandering tide;<br> And lingered in the hidden desolate place,<br> Where the last Phoenix died<br> And wrapped the flames above his holy head;<br> And still murmur and long: <A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A><br> O Piteous Hearts, changing till change be dead<br> In a tumultuous song":<br> And cover the pale blossoms of your breast<br> With your dim heavy hair,<br> And trouble with a sigh for all things longing for rest<br> The odorous twilight there.</p>
