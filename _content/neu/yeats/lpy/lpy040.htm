<p>MAEVE the great queen was pacing to and fro,<br> Between the walls covered with beaten bronze,<br> In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth,<br> Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed<br> Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes,<br> Or on the benches underneath the walls,<br> In comfortable sleep; all living slept<br> But that great queen, who more than half the night<br> Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.<br> Though now in her old age, in her young age<br> She had been beautiful in that old way<br> That's all but gone; for the proud heart is gone,<br> And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all<br> But soft beauty and indolent desire. <A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A><br> She could have called over the rim of the world<br> Whatever woman's lover had hit her fancy,<br> And yet had been great bodied and great limbed,<br> Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;<br> And she'd had lucky eyes and a high heart,<br> And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax,<br> At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,<br> Sudden and laughing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O unquiet heart,<br> Why do you praise another, praising her,<br> As if there were no tale but your own tale<br> Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?<br> Have I not bid you tell of that great queen<br> Who has been buried some two thousand years?</p>  
<p>When night was at its deepest, a wild goose<br> Cried from the porter's lodge, and with long clamour<br> Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks;<br> But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power<br> Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;<br> And wondering who of the many-changing Sidhe<br> Had come as in the old times to counsel her, <A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A><br> Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall, being old,<br> To that small chamber by the outer gate.<br> The porter slept, although he sat upright<br> With still and stony limbs and open eyes.<br> Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise<br> Broke from his parted lips and broke again,<br> She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,<br> And shook him wide awake, and bid him say<br> Who of the wandering many-changing ones<br> Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say<br> Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs<br> More still than they had been for a good month,<br> He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing,<br> He could remember when he had had fine dreams.<br> It was before the time of the great war<br> Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.</p>  
<p>She turned away; he turned again to sleep<br> That no god troubled now, and, wondering<br> What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,<br> Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh<br> Lifted the curtain of her sleeping-room,<br> Remembering that she too had seemed divine <A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A><br> To many thousand eyes, and to her own<br> One that the generations had long waited<br> That work too difficult for mortal hands<br> Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up<br> She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,<br> And thought of days when he'd had a straight body,<br> And of that famous Fergus, Nessa's husband,<br> Who had been the lover of her middle life.</p>  
<p>Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,<br> And not with his own voice or a man's voice,<br> But with the burning, live, unshaken voice,<br> Of those that it may be can never age.<br> He said, "High Queen of Cruachan and Magh Ai,<br> A king of the Great Plain would speak with you."<br> And with glad voice Maeve answered him, "What king<br> Of the far wandering shadows has come to me?<br> As in the old days when they would come and go<br> About my threshold to counsel and to help."<br> The parted lips replied, "I seek your help,<br> For I am Aengus, and I am crossed in love."<br> "How may a mortal whose life gutters out<br> Help them that wander with hand clasping hand, <A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A><br> Their haughty images that cannot wither,<br> For all their beauty's like a hollow dream,<br> Mirrored in streams that neither hail nor rain<br> Nor the cold North has troubled?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied:<br> "I am from those rivers and I bid you call<br> The children of the Maines out of sleep,<br> And set them digging under Bual's hill.<br> We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,<br> Will overthrow his shadows and carry off<br> Caer, his blue-eyed daughter that I love.<br> I helped your fathers when they built these walls,<br> And I would have your help in my great need,<br> Queen of high Cruachan."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I obey your will<br> With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:<br> For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,<br> Our giver of good counsel and good luck."<br> And with a groan, as if the mortal breath<br> Could but awaken sadly upon lips<br> That happier breath had moved, her husband turned<br> Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;<br> But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,<br> Came to the threshold of the painted house,<br> Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,<br> Until the pillared dark began to stir <A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A><br> With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.<br> She told them of the many-changing ones;<br> And all that night, and all through the next day<br> To middle night, they dug into the hill.<br> At middle night great cats with silver claws,<br> Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,<br> Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds<br> With long white bodies came out of the air<br> Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</p>  
<p>The Maines' children dropped their spades, and stood<br> With quaking joints and terror-strucken faces,<br> Till Maeve called out: "These are but common men.<br> The Maines' children have not dropped their spades,<br> Because Earth, crazy for its broken power,<br> Casts up a show and the winds answer it<br> With holy shadows." Her high heart was glad,<br> And when the uproar ran along the grass<br> She followed with light footfall in the midst,<br> Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.</p>  
<p>Friend of these many years, you too had stood<br> With equal courage in that whirling rout; <A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A><br> For you, although you've not her wandering heart,<br> Have all that greatness, and not hers alone,<br> For there is no high story about queens<br> In any ancient book but tells of you;<br> And when I've heard how they grew old and died,<br> Or fell into unhappiness, I've said:<br> "She will grow old and die, and she has wept!"<br> And when I'd write it out anew, the words,<br> Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!<br> Outrun the measure.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd tell of that great queen<br> Who stood amid a silence by the thorn<br> Until two lovers came out of the air<br> With bodies made out of soft fire. The one,<br> About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings,<br> Said: "Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks<br> To Maeve and to Maeve's household, owing all<br> In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace."<br> Then Maeve: "O Aengus, Master of all lovers,<br> A thousand years ago you held high talk<br> With the first kings of many-pillared Cruachan. <A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A><br> O when will you grow weary?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had vanished;<br> But out of the dark air over her head there came<br> A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</p>
