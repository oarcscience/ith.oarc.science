### IN MEMORY OF MAJOR ROBERT GREGORY

1

Now that we're almost settled in our house  
I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us  
Beside a fire of turf in th’ ancient tower,  
And having talked to some late hour  
Climb up the narrow winding stair to bed:  
Discoverers of forgotten truth  
Or mere companions of my youth,  
All, all are in my thoughts to-night being dead.

2

Always we'd have the new friend meet the old  
And we are hurt if either friend seem cold,  
And there is salt to lengthen out the smart  
In the affections of our heart,  
And quarrels are blown up upon that head;  
But not a friend that I would bring  
This night can set us quarrelling,  
For all that come into my mind are dead.

Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind,  
That loved his learning better than mankind,  
Though courteous to the worst; much falling he  
Brooded upon sanctity  
Till all his Greek and Latin learning seemed  
A long blast upon the horn that brought  
A little nearer to his thought  
A measureless consummation that he dreamed.

4

And that enquiring man John Synge comes next  
That dying chose the living world for text  
And never could have rested in the tomb  
But that, long travelling, he had come  
Towards nightfall upon certain set apart  
In a most desolate stony place,  
Towards nightfall upon a race  
Passionate and simple like his heart.

5

And then I think of old George Pollexfen,  
In muscular youth well known to Mayo men <span id="page_241">p.
241</span>  
For horsemanship at meets or at racecourses,  
That could have shown how purebred horses  
And solid men, for all their passion, live  
But as the outrageous stars incline  
By opposition, square and trine;  
Having grown sluggish and contemplative.

6

They were my close companions many a year,  
A portion of my mind and life, as it were,  
And now their breathless faces seem to look  
Out of some old picture-book;  
I am accustomed to their lack of breath,  
But not that my dear friend's dear son,  
Our Sidney and our perfect man,  
Could share in that discourtesy of death.

7

For all things the delighted eye now sees  
Were loved by him; the old storm-broken trees  
That cast their shadows upon road and bridge;  
The tower set on the stream's edge;  
The ford where drinking cattle make a stir  
Nightly, and startled by that sound <span id="page_242">p. 242</span>  
The water-hen must change her ground;  
He might have been your heartiest welcomer.

8

When with the Galway foxhounds he would ride  
From Castle Taylor to the Roxborough side  
Or Esserkelly plain, few kept his pace;  
At Mooneen he had leaped a place  
So perilous that half the astonished meet  
Had shut their eyes, and where was it  
He rode a race without a bit?  
And yet his mind outran the horses' feet.

9

We dreamed that a great painter had been born  
To cold Clare rock and Galway rock and thorn,  
To that stern colour and that delicate line  
That are our secret discipline  
Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might.  
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,  
And yet he had the intensity  
To have published all to be a world's delight.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

10

What other could so well have counselled us  
In all lovely intricacies of a house  
As he that practised or that understood  
All work in metal or in wood,  
In moulded plaster or in carven stone?  
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,  
And all he did done perfectly  
As though he had but that one trade alone.

11

Some burn damp fagots, others may consume  
The entire combustible world in one small room  
As though dried straw, and if we turn about  
The bare chimney is gone black out  
Because the work had finished in that flare.  
Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,  
As ’twere all life's epitome.  
What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?

12

I had thought, seeing how bitter is that wind  
That shakes the shutter, to have brought to mind <span id="page_244">p.
244</span>  
All those that manhood tried, or childhood loved  
Or boyish intellect approved,  
With some appropriate commentary on each;  
Until imagination brought  
A fitter welcome; but a thought  
Of that late death took all my heart for speech.
