### SOLOMON AND THE WITCH

AND thus declared that Arab lady:  
'Last night, where under the wild moon  
On grassy mattress I had laid me,  
Within my arms great Solomon,  
I suddenly cried out in a strange tongue  
Not his, not mine."  
                      And he that knew  
All sounds by bird or angel sung  
Answered: "A crested cockerel crew  
Upon a blossoming apple bough  
Three hundred years before the Fall,  
And never crew again till now,  
And would not now but that he thought,  
Chance being at one with Choice at last,  
All that the brigand apple brought  
And this foul world were dead at last.  
He that crowed out eternity  
Thought to have crowed it in again.  
A lover with a spider's eye  
Will find out some appropriate pain,  
Aye, though all passion's in the glance,  
For every nerve: lover tests lover  
With cruelties of Choice and Chance;  
And when at last that murder's over <span id="page_328">p. 328</span>  
Maybe the bride-bed brings despair  
For each an imagined image brings  
And finds a real image there;  
Yet the world ends when these two things,  
Though several, are a single light,  
When oil and wick are burned in one;  
Therefore a blessed moon last night  
Gave Sheba to her Solomon."

"Yet the world stays":  
                            "If that be so,  
Your cockerel found us in the wrong  
Although he thought it worth a crow.  
Maybe an image is too strong  
Or maybe is not strong enough."

"The night has fallen; not a sound  
In the forbidden sacred grove  
Unless a petal hit the ground,  
Nor any human sight within it  
But the crushed grass where we have lain;  
And the moon is wilder every minute.  
Oh, Solomon! let us try again."
