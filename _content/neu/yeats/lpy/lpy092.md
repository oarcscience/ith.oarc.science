### BEGGAR TO BEGGAR CRIED

"TIME to put off the world and go somewhere  
And find my health again in the sea air,"  
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,  
"And make my soul before my pate is bare."

"And get a comfortable wife and house  
To rid me of the devil in my shoes,"  
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,  
"And the worse devil that is between my thighs."

"And though I'd marry with a comely lass,  
She need not be too comely--let it pass,"  
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,  
"But there's a devil in a looking-glass."

"Nor should she be too rich, because the rich  
Are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch,"  
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,  
"And cannot have a humorous happy speech." <span id="page_209">p.

"And there I'll grow respected at my ease,  
And hear amid the garden's nightly peace,"  
Beggar to beggar cried, being frenzy-struck,  
"The wind-blown clamour of the barnacle-geese."
