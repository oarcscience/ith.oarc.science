<p>I WENT out to the hazel wood,<br> Because a fire was in my head,<br> And cut and peeled a hazel wand,<br> And hooked a berry to a thread;<br> And when white moths were on the wing,<br> And moth-like stars were flickering out,<br> I dropped the berry in a stream<br> And caught a little silver trout.</p>  
<p>When I had laid it on the floor<br> I went to blow the fire a-flame,<br> But something rustled on the floor,<br> And some one called me by my name:<br> It had become a glimmering girl<br> With apple blossom in her hair<br> Who called me by my name and ran<br> And faded through the brightening air.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_13"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Though I am old with wandering<br> Through hollow lands and hilly lands,<br> I will find out where she has gone,<br> And kiss her lips and take her hands;<br> And walk among long dappled grass,<br> And pluck till time and times are done<br> The silver apples of the moon,<br> The golden apples of the sun.</p>
