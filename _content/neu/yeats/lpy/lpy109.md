### THE DOLLS

A DOLL in the doll-maker's house  
Looks at the cradle and bawls:  
"That is an insult to us."  
But the oldest of all the dolls  
Who had seen, being kept for show,  
Generations of his sort,  
Out-screams the whole shelf: "Although  
There's not a man can report  
Evil of this place,  
The man and the woman bring  
Hither to our disgrace,  
A noisy and filthy thing."  
Hearing him groan and stretch  
The doll-maker's wife is aware  
Her husband has heard the wretch,  
And crouched by the arm of his chair,  
She murmurs into his ear,  
Head upon shoulder leant:  
"My dear, my dear, oh dear,  
It was an accident."
