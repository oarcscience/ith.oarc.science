### TO A YOUNG BEAUTY

DEAR fellow-artist, why so free  
With every sort of company,  
With every Jack and Jill?  
Choose your companions from the best;  
Who draws a bucket with the rest  
Soon topples down the hill.

You may, that mirror for a school,  
Be passionate, not bountiful  
As common beauties may,  
Who were not born to keep in trim  
With old Ezekiel's cherubim  
But those of Beaujolet.

I know what wages beauty gives,  
How hard a life her servant lives,  
Yet praise the winters gone:  
There is not a fool can call me friend,  
And I may dine at journey's end  
With Landor and with Donne.
