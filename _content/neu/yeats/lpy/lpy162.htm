<p>FOR certain minutes at the least<br> That crafty demon and that loud beast<br> That plague me day and night<br> Ran out of my sight;<br> Though I had long pernned in the gyre,<br> Between my hatred and desire,<br> I saw my freedom won<br> And all laugh in the sun.</p>  
<p>The glittering eyes in a death's head<br> Of old Luke Wadding's portrait said<br> Welcome, and the Ormonds all<br> Nodded upon the wall,<br> And even Stafford smiled as though<br> It made him happier to know<br> I understood his plan.<br> Now that the loud beast ran<br> There was no portrait in the Gallery<br> But beckoned to sweet company,<br> For all men's thoughts grew clear<br> Being dear as mine are dear.</p>  
<p>But soon a tear-drop started up<br> For aimless joy had made me stop <A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A><br> Beside the little lake<br> To watch a white gull take<br> A bit of bread thrown up into the air;<br> Now gyring down and pernning there<br> He splashed where an absurd<br> Portly green-pated bird<br> Shook off the water from his back;<br> Being no more demoniac<br> A stupid happy creature<br> Could rouse my whole nature.</p>  
<p>Yet I am certain as can be<br> That every natural victory<br> Belongs to beast or demon,<br> That never yet had freeman<br> Right mastery of natural things,<br> And that mere growing old, that brings<br> Chilled blood, this sweetness brought;<br> Yet have no dearer thought<br> Than that I may find out a way<br> To make it linger half a day.</p>  
<p>O what a sweetness strayed<br> Through barren Thebaid,<br> Or by the Mareotic sea<br> When that exultant Anthony<br> And twice a thousand more<br> Starved upon the shore<br> And withered to a bag of bones:<br> What had the Caesars but their thrones?</p>
