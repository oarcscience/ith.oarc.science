<p>WOULD I could cast a sail on the water<br> Where many a king has gone<br> And many a king's daughter,<br> And alight at the comely trees and the lawn,<br> The playing upon pipes and the dancing,<br> And learn that the best thing is<br> To change my loves while dancing<br> And pay but a kiss for a kiss.</p>  
<p>I would find by the edge of that water<br> The collar-bone of a hare<br> Worn thin by the lapping of water,<br> And pierce it through with a gimlet and stare<br> At the old bitter world where they marry in churches,<br> And laugh over the untroubled water<br> At all who marry in churches,<br> Through the white thin bone of a hare.</p>
