<p>Now all the truth is out,<br> Be secret and take defeat<br> From any brazen throat,<br> For how can you compete,<br> Being honour bred, with one<br> Who, were it proved he lies,<br> Were neither shamed in his own<br> Nor in his neighbours' eyes?<br> Bred to a harder thing<br> Than Triumph, turn away<br> And like a laughing string<br> Whereon mad fingers play<br> Amid a place of stone,<br> Be secret and exult,<br> Because of all things known<br> That is most difficult.</p>
