<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>NEVER until this night have I been stirred.<br> The elaborate star-light throws a reflection<br> On the dark stream,<br> Till all the eddies gleam;<br> And thereupon there comes that scream<br> From terrified, invisible beast or bird:<br> Image of poignant recollection.</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>An image of my heart that is smitten through<br> Out of all likelihood, or reason,<br> And when at last,<br> Youth's bitterness being past,<br> I had thought that all my days were cast<br> Amid most lovely places; smitten as though<br> It had not learned its lesson.</p>  
<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>Why have you laid your hands upon my eyes?<br> What can have suddenly alarmed you <A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A><br> Whereon &#8217;twere best<br> My eyes should never rest?<br> What is there but the slowly fading west,<br> The river imaging the flashing skies,<br> All that to this moment charmed you?</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>A sweetheart from another life floats there<br> As though she had been forced to linger<br> From vague distress<br> Or arrogant loveliness,<br> Merely to loosen out a tress<br> Among the starry eddies of her hair<br> Upon the paleness of a finger.</p>  
<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>But why should you grow suddenly afraid<br> And start--I at your shoulder--<br> Imagining<br> That any night could bring<br> An image up, or anything<br> Even to eyes that beauty had driven mad,<br> But images to make me fonder.</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>Now she has thrown her arms above her head;<br> Whether she threw them up to flout me, <A NAME="page_331"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 331</FONT></A><br> Or but to find,<br> Now that no fingers bind,<br> That her hair streams upon the wind,<br> I do not know, that know I am afraid<br> Of the hovering thing night brought me.</p>
