### THE LIVING BEAUTY

I'LL say and maybe dream I have drawn content--  
Seeing that time has frozen up the blood,  
The wick of youth being burned and the oil spent--  
From beauty that is cast out of a mould  
In bronze, or that in dazzling marble appears,  
Appears, and when we have gone is gone again,  
Being more indifferent to our solitude  
Than ’twere an apparition. O heart, we are old,  
The living beauty is for younger men,  
We cannot pay its tribute of wild tears.
