<p>THIS night has been so strange that it seemed<br> As if the hair stood up on my head.<br> From going-down of the sun I have dreamed<br> That women laughing, or timid or wild,<br> In rustle of lace or silken stuff,<br> Climbed up my creaking stair. They had read<br> All I had rhymed of that monstrous thing<br> Returned and yet unrequited love.<br> They stood in the door and stood between<br> My great wood lecturn and the fire<br> Till I could hear their hearts beating:<br> One is a harlot, and one a child<br> That never looked upon man with desire,<br> And one it may be a queen.</p>
