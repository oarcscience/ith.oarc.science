<p>A DOLL in the doll-maker's house<br> Looks at the cradle and bawls:<br> "That is an insult to us."<br> But the oldest of all the dolls<br> Who had seen, being kept for show,<br> Generations of his sort,<br> Out-screams the whole shelf: "Although<br> There's not a man can report<br> Evil of this place,<br> The man and the woman bring<br> Hither to our disgrace,<br> A noisy and filthy thing."<br> Hearing him groan and stretch<br> The doll-maker's wife is aware<br> Her husband has heard the wretch,<br> And crouched by the arm of his chair,<br> She murmurs into his ear,<br> Head upon shoulder leant:<br> "My dear, my dear, oh dear,<br> It was an accident."</p>
