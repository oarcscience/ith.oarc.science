### PEACE

AH, that Time could touch a form  
That could show what Homer's age  
Bred to be a hero's wage.  
"Were not all her life but storm,  
Would not painters paint a form  
Of such noble lines," I said,  
"Such a delicate high head,  
All that sternness amid charm,  
All that sweetness amid strength?"  
Ah, but peace that comes at length,  
Came when Time had touched her form.
