### THE MASK

"PUT off that mask of burning gold  
With emerald eyes."  
"O no, my dear, you make so bold  
To find if hearts be wild and wise,  
And yet not cold."

"I would but find what's there to find,  
Love or deceit."  
"It was the mask engaged your mind,  
And after set your heart to beat,  
Not what's behind."

"But lest you are my enemy,  
I must enquire."  
"O no, my dear, let all that be,  
What matter, so there is but fire  
In you, in me?"
