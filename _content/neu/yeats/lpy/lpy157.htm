<p>O BUT we talked at large before<br> The sixteen men were shot,<br> But who can talk of give and take,<br> What should be and what not?<br> While those dead men are loitering there<br> To stir the boiling pot.</p>  
<p>You say that we should still the land<br> Till Germany's overcome;<br> But who is there to argue that<br> Now Pearse is deaf and dumb?<br> And is their logic to outweigh<br> MacDonagh's bony thumb?</p>  
<p>How could you dream they'd listen<br> That have an ear alone<br> For those new comrades they have found<br> Lord Edward and Wolfe Tone,<br> Or meddle with our give and take<br> That converse bone to bone.</p>
