### THE THREE BEGGARS

"*THOUGH to my feathers in the wet,  
I have stood here from break of day,  
I have not found a thing to eat  
For only rubbish comes my way.  
Am I to live on lebeen-lone?*"  
*Muttered the old crane of Gort*.  
"*For all my pains on lebeen-lone*."

King Guari walked amid his court  
The palace-yard and river-side  
And there to three old beggars said:  
"You that have wandered far and wide  
Can ravel out what's in my head.  
Do men who least desire get most,  
Or get the most who most desire?"  
A beggar said: "They get the most  
Whom man or devil cannot tire,  
And what could make their muscles taut  
Unless desire had made them so."  
But Guari laughed with secret thought,  
"If that be true as it seems true,  
One of you three is a rich man,  
For he shall have a thousand pounds  
Who is first asleep, if but he can <span id="page_204">p. 204</span>  
Sleep before the third noon sounds."  
And thereon merry as a bird,  
With his old thoughts King Guari went  
From river-side and palace-yard  
And left them to their argument.  
"And if I win," one beggar said,  
"Though I am old I shall persuade  
A pretty girl to share my bed";  
The second: "I shall learn a trade";  
The third: "I'll hurry to the course  
Among the other gentlemen,  
And lay it all upon a horse ";  
The second: "I have thought again:  
A farmer has more dignity."  
One to another sighed and cried:  
The exorbitant dreams of beggary,  
That idleness had borne to pride,  
Sang through their teeth from noon to noon;  
And when the second twilight brought  
The frenzy of the beggars' moon  
None closed his blood-shot eyes but sought  
To keep his fellows from their sleep;  
All shouted till their anger grew  
And they were whirling in a heap.

They mauled and bit the whole night through;  
They mauled and bit till the day shone;  
They mauled and bit through all that day  
And till another night had gone,  
Or if they made a moment's stay <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>  
They sat upon their heels to rail,  
And when old Guari came and stood  
Before the three to end this tale,  
They were commingling lice and blood.  
"Time's up," he cried, and all the three  
With blood-shot eyes upon him stared.  
"Time's up," he cried, and all the three  
Fell down upon the dust and snored.

*"Maybe I shall be lucky yet,  
Now they are silent," said the crane.  
"Though to my feathers in the wet  
I've stood as I were made of stone  
And seen the rubbish run about,  
It's certain there are trout somewhere  
And maybe I shall take a trout  
If but I do not seem to care."*
