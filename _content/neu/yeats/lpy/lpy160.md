### THE LEADERS OF THE CROWD

THEY must to keep their certainty accuse  
All that are different of a base intent;  
Pull down established honour; hawk for news  
Whatever their loose phantasy invent  
And murmur it with bated breath, as though  
The abounding gutter had been Helicon  
Or calumny a song. How can they know  
Truth flourishes where the student's lamp has shone,  
And there alone, that have no solitude?  
So the crowd come they care not what may come.  
They have loud music, hope every day renewed  
And heartier loves; that lamp is from the tomb.
