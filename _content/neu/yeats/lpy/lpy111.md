*WHILE I, from that reed-throated whisperer  
Who comes at need, although not now as once  
A clear articulation in the air  
But inwardly, surmise companions  
Beyond the fling of the dull ass's hoof,  
--Ben Jonson's phrase--and find when June is come  
At Kyle-na-no under that ancient roof  
A sterner conscience and a friendlier home,  
I can forgive even that wrong of wrongs,  
Those undreamt accidents that have made me  
--Seeing that Fame has perished this long while  
Being but a part of ancient ceremony--  
Notorious, till all my priceless things  
Are but a post the passing dogs defile*.
