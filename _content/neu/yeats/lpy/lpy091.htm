<p>THREE old hermits took the air<br> By a cold and desolate sea,<br> First was muttering a prayer,<br> Second rummaged for a flea;<br> On a windy stone, the third,<br> Giddy with his hundredth year,<br> Sang unnoticed like a bird.<br> "Though the Door of Death is near<br> And what waits behind the door,<br> Three times in a single day<br> I, though upright on the shore,<br> Fall asleep when I should pray."<br> So the first but now the second,<br> "We're but given what we have earned<br> When all thoughts and deeds are reckoned,<br> So it's plain to be discerned<br> That the shades of holy men,<br> Who have failed being weak of will,<br> Pass the Door of Birth again,<br> And are plagued by crowds, until<br> They've the passion to escape."<br> Moaned the other, "They are thrown<br> Into some most fearful shape."<br> But the second mocked his moan: <A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A><br> "They are not changed to anything,<br> Having loved God once, but maybe,<br> To a poet or a king<br> Or a witty lovely lady."<br> While he'd rummaged rags and hair,<br> Caught and cracked his flea, the third,<br> Giddy with his hundredth year<br> Sang unnoticed like a bird.</p>
