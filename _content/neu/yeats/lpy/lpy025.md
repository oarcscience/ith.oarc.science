### HE TELLS OF A VALLEY FULL OF LOVERS

I DREAMED that I stood in a valley, and amid sighs,  
For happy lovers passed two by two where I stood;  
And I dreamed my lost love came stealthily out of the wood  
With her cloud-pale eyelids falling on dream-dimmed eyes:  
I cried in my dream, *O women, bid the young men lay  
Their heads on your knees, and drown their eyes with your hair,  
Or remembering hers they will find no other face fair  
Till all the valleys of the world have been withered away*.
