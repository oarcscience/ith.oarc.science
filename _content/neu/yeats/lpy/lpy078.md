### ALL THINGS CAN TEMPT ME

ALL things can tempt me from this craft of verse:  
One time it was a woman's face, or worse--  
The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;  
Now nothing but comes readier to the hand  
Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,  
I had not given a penny for a song  
Did not the poet sing it with such airs  
That one believed he had a sword upstairs;  
Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,  
Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish.
