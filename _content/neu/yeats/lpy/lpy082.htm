<p>KING EOCHAID came at sundown to a wood<br> Westward of Tara. Hurrying to his queen<br> He had out-ridden his war-wasted men<br> That with empounded cattle trod the mire;<br> And where beech trees had mixed a pale green light<br> With the ground-ivy's blue, he saw a stag<br> Whiter than curds, its eyes the tint of the sea.<br> Because it stood upon his path and seemed<br> More hands in height than any stag in the world<br> He sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth<br> Upon his trembling horse, then drove the spur;<br> But the stag stooped and ran at him, and passed,<br> Rending the horse's flank. King Eochaid reeled<br> Then drew his sword to hold its levelled point<br> Against the stag. When horn and steel were met <A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A><br> The horn resounded as though it had been silver,<br> A sweet, miraculous, terrifying sound.<br> Horn locked in sword, they tugged and struggled there<br> As though a stag and unicorn were met<br> In Africa on Mountain of the Moon,<br> Until at last the double horns, drawn backward,<br> Butted below the single and so pierced<br> The entrails of the horse. Dropping his sword<br> King Eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands<br> And stared into the sea-green eye, and so<br> Hither and thither to and fro they trod<br> Till all the place was beaten into mire.<br> The strong thigh and the agile thigh were met,<br> The hands that gathered up the might of the world,<br> And hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed<br> Amid the elaborate wilderness of the air.<br> Through bush they plunged and over ivied root,<br> And where the stone struck fire, while in the leaves<br> A squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out;<br> But when at last he forced those sinewy flanks <A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A><br> Against a beech bole, he threw down the beast<br> And knelt above it with drawn knife. On the instant<br> It vanished like a shadow, and a cry<br> So mournful that it seemed the cry of one<br> Who had lost some unimaginable treasure<br> Wandered between the blue and the green leaf<br> And climbed into the air, crumbling away,<br> Till all had seemed a shadow or a vision<br> But for the trodden mire, the pool of blood,<br> The disembowelled horse.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Eochaid ran,<br> Toward peopled Tara, nor stood to draw his breath<br> Until he came before the painted wall,<br> The posts of polished yew, circled with bronze,<br> Of the great door; but though the hanging lamps<br> Showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows,<br> Nor door, nor mouth, nor slipper made a noise,<br> Nor on the ancient beaten paths, that wound<br> From well-side or from plough-land, was there noise;<br> Nor had there been the noise of living thing<br> Before him or behind, but that far-off<br> On the horizon edge bellowed the herds. <A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A><br> Knowing that silence brings no good to kings,<br> And mocks returning victory, he passed<br> Between the pillars with a beating heart<br> And saw where in the midst of the great hall<br> Pale-faced, alone upon a bench, Edain<br> Sat upright with a sword before her feet.<br> Her hands on either side had gripped the bench,<br> Her eyes were cold and steady, her lips tight.<br> Some passion had made her stone. Hearing a foot<br> She started and then knew whose foot it was;<br> But when he thought to take her in his arms<br> She motioned him afar, and rose and spoke:<br> "I have sent among the fields or to the woods<br> The fighting men and servants of this house,<br> For I would have your judgment upon one<br> Who is self-accused. If she be innocent<br> She would not look in any known man's face<br> Till judgment has been given, and if guilty,<br> Will never look again on known man's face."<br> And at these words he paled, as she had paled,<br> Knowing that he should find upon her lips<br> The meaning of that monstrous day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she:<br> "You brought me where your brother Ardan sat <A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A><br> Always in his one seat, and bid me care him<br> Through that strange illness that had fixed him there,<br> And should he die to heap his burial mound<br> And carve his name in Ogham." Eochaid said,<br> "He lives?" "He lives and is a healthy man."<br> "While I have him and you it matters little<br> What man you have lost, what evil you have found."<br> "I bid them make his bed under this roof<br> And carried him his food with my own hands,<br> And so the weeks passed by. But when I said<br> 'What is this trouble?' he would answer nothing,<br> Though always at my words his trouble grew;<br> And I but asked the more, till he cried out,<br> Weary of many questions: 'There are things<br> That make the heart akin to the dumb stone.'<br> Then I replied: 'Although you hide a secret,<br> Hopeless and dear, or terrible to think on,<br> Speak it, that I may send through the wide world<br> For medicine.' Thereon he cried aloud: <A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A><br> 'Day after day you question me, and I,<br> Because there is such a storm amid my thoughts<br> I shall be carried in the gust, command,<br> Forbid, beseech and waste my breath.' Then I,<br> 'Although the thing that you have hid were evil,<br> The speaking of it could be no great wrong,<br> And evil must it be, if done &#8217;twere worse<br> Than mound and stone that keep all virtue in,<br> And loosen on us dreams that waste our life,<br> Shadows and shows that can but turn the brain.'<br> But finding him still silent I stooped down<br> And whispering that none but he should hear,<br> Said: 'If a woman has put this on you,<br> My men, whether it please her or displease,<br> And though they have to cross the Loughlan waters<br> And take her in the middle of armed men,<br> Shall make her look upon her handiwork,<br> That she may quench the rick she has fired; and though<br> She may have worn silk clothes, or worn a crown,<br> She'll not be proud, knowing within her heart <A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A><br> That our sufficient portion of the world<br> Is that we give, although it be brief giving,<br> Happiness to children and to men.'<br> Then he, driven by his thought beyond his thought,<br> And speaking what he would not though he would,<br> Sighed: 'You, even you yourself, could work the cure!'<br> And at those words I rose and I went out<br> And for nine days he had food from other hands,<br> And for nine days my mind went whirling round<br> The one disastrous zodiac, muttering<br> That the immedicable mound's beyond<br> Our questioning, beyond our pity even.<br> But when nine days had gone I stood again<br> Before his chair and bending down my head<br> Told him, that when Orion rose, and all<br> The women of his household were asleep,<br> To go--for hope would give his limbs the power--<br> To an old empty woodman's house that's hidden<br> Close to a clump of beech trees in the wood<br> Westward of Tara, there to await a friend<br> That could, as he had told her, work his cure<br> And would be no harsh friend.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When night had deepened, <br> I groped my way through boughs, and over roots,<br> Till oak and hazel ceased and beech began,<br> And found the house, a sputtering torch within,<br> And stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins<br> Ardan, and though I called to him and tried<br> To shake him out of sleep, I could not rouse him.<br> I waited till the night was on the turn,<br> Then fearing that some labourer, on his way<br> To plough or pasture-land, might see me there,<br> Went out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the ivy-covered rocks,<br> As on the blue light of a sword, a man<br> Who had unnatural majesty, and eyes<br> Like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods,<br> Stood on my path. Trembling from head to foot<br> I gazed at him like grouse upon a kite;<br> But with a voice that had unnatural music,<br> 'A weary wooing and a long,' he said,<br> 'Speaking of love through other lips and looking<br> Under the eyelids of another, for it was my craft<br> That put a passion in the sleeper there,<br> And when I had got my will and drawn you here, <A NAME="page_190"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 190</FONT></A><br> Where I may speak to you alone, my craft<br> Sucked up the passion out of him again<br> And left mere sleep. He'll wake when the sun wakes,<br> Push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes,<br> And wonder what has ailed him these twelve months.'<br> I cowered back upon the wall in terror,<br> But that sweet-sounding voice ran on: 'Woman,<br> I was your husband when you rode the air,<br> Danced in the whirling foam and in the dust,<br> In days you have not kept in memory,<br> Being betrayed into a cradle, and I come<br> That I may claim you as my wife again.'<br> I was no longer terrified, his voice<br> Had half awakened some old memory,<br> Yet answered him: 'I am King Eochaid's wife<br> And with him have found every happiness<br> Women can find.' With a most masterful voice,<br> That made the body seem as it were a string<br> Under a bow, he cried: 'What happiness<br> Can lovers have that know their happiness<br> Must end at the dumb stone? But where we build<br> Our sudden palaces in the still air<br> Pleasure itself can bring no weariness, <A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A><br> Nor can time waste the cheek, nor is there foot<br> That has grown weary of the whirling dance,<br> Nor an unlaughing mouth, but mine that mourns,<br> Among those mouths that sing their sweethearts' praise,<br> Your empty bed.' 'How should I love,' I answered,<br> 'Were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed<br> And shown my husband sleeping there, I have sighed,<br> "Your strength and nobleness will pass away."<br> Or how should love be worth its pains were it not<br> That when he has fallen asleep within my arms,<br> Being wearied out, I love in man the child?<br> What can they know of love that do not know<br> She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge<br> Above a windy precipice?' Then he:<br> 'Seeing that when you come to the deathbed<br> You must return, whether you would or no,<br> This human life blotted from memory,<br> Why must I live some thirty, forty years,<br> Alone with all this useless happiness?'<br> Thereon he seized me in his arms, but I <A NAME="page_192"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 192</FONT></A><br> Thrust him away with both my hands and cried,<br> 'Never will I believe there is any change<br> Can blot out of my memory this life<br> Sweetened by death, but if I could believe<br> That were a double hunger in my lips<br> For what is doubly brief.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the shape,<br> My hands were pressed to, vanished suddenly.<br> I staggered, but a beech tree stayed my fall,<br> And clinging to it I could hear the cocks<br> Crow upon Tara."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Eochaid bowed his head<br> And thanked her for her kindness to his brother,<br> For that she promised, and for that refused.</p>  
<p>Thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds<br> Rose round the walls, and through the bronze-ringed door<br> Jostled and shouted those war-wasted men,<br> And in the midst King Eochaid's brother stood,<br> And bade all welcome, being ignorant.</p>
