<p>How should the world be luckier if this house,<br> Where passion and precision have been one<br> Time out of mind, became too ruinous<br> To breed the lidless eye that loves the sun?<br> And the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow<br> Where wings have memory of wings, and all<br> That comes of the best knit to the best? Although<br> Mean roof-trees were the sturdier for its fall,<br> How should their luck run high enough to reach<br> The gifts that govern men, and after these<br> To gradual Time's last gift, a written speech<br> Wrought of high laughter, loveliness and ease?</p>
