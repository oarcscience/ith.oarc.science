### A POET TO HIS BELOVED

I BRING you with reverent hands  
The books of my numberless dreams;  
White woman that passion has worn  
As the tide wears the dove-grey sands,  
And with heart more old than the horn  
That is brimmed from the pale fire of time:  
White woman with numberless dreams  
I bring you my passionate rhyme.
