<p align="center">I</p>  
<p>A SPECKLED cat and a tame hare<br> Eat at my hearthstone<br> And sleep there;<br> And both look up to me alone<br> For learning and defence<br> As I look up to Providence.</p>  
<p>I start out of my sleep to think<br> Some day I may forget<br> Their food and drink;<br> Or, the house door left unshut,<br> The hare may run till it's found<br> The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.</p>  
<p>I bear a burden that might well try<br> Men that do all by rule,<br> And what can I<br> That am a wandering witted fool<br> But pray to God that He ease<br> My great responsibilities.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">II</p>  
<p>I slept on my three-legged stool by the fire,<br> The speckled cat slept on my knee;<br> We never thought to enquire<br> Where the brown hare might be,<br> And whether the door were shut.<br> Who knows how she drank the wind<br> Stretched up on two legs from the mat,<br> Before she had settled her mind<br> To drum with her heel and to leap:<br> Had I but awakened from sleep<br> And called her name she had heard,<br> It may be, and had not stirred,<br> That now, it may be, has found<br> The horn's sweet note and the tooth of the hound.</p>
