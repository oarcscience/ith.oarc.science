<p>THEY must to keep their certainty accuse<br> All that are different of a base intent;<br> Pull down established honour; hawk for news<br> Whatever their loose phantasy invent<br> And murmur it with bated breath, as though<br> The abounding gutter had been Helicon<br> Or calumny a song. How can they know<br> Truth flourishes where the student's lamp has shone,<br> And there alone, that have no solitude?<br> So the crowd come they care not what may come.<br> They have loud music, hope every day renewed<br> And heartier loves; that lamp is from the tomb.</p>
