<p>THE old brown thorn trees break in two high over Cummen Strand,<br> Under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand;<br> Our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies,<br> But we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes<br> Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.</p>  
<p>The wind has bundled up the clouds high over Knocknarea,<br> And thrown the thunder on the stones for all that Maeve can say.<br> Angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat;<br> But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet<br> Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan. <A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The yellow pool has overflowed high up on Clooth-na-Bare,<br> For the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air;<br> Like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood;<br> But purer than a tall candle before the Holy Rood<br> Is Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.</p>
