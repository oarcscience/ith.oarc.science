<p>ONCE more the storm is howling and half hid<br> Under this cradle-hood and coverlid<br> My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle<br> But Gregory's wood and one bare hill<br> Whereby the haystack and roof-levelling wind,<br> Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;<br> And for an hour I have walked and prayed<br> Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.</p>  
<p>I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour<br> And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,<br> And under the arches of the bridge, and scream<br> In the elms above the flooded stream;<br> Imagining in excited reverie<br> That the future years had come,<br> Dancing to a frenzied drum,<br> Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A></p>  
<p>May she be granted beauty and yet not<br> Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,<br> Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,<br> Being made beautiful overmuch,<br> Consider beauty a sufficient end,<br> Lose natural kindness and maybe<br> The heart-revealing intimacy<br> That chooses right and never find a friend.</p>  
<p>Helen being chosen found life flat and dull<br> And later had much trouble from a fool,<br> While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,<br> Being fatherless could have her way<br> Yet chose a bandy-legged smith for man.<br> It's certain that fine women eat<br> A crazy salad with their meat<br> Whereby the Horn of Plenty is undone.</p>  
<p>In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;<br> Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned<br> By those that are not entirely beautiful;<br> Yet many, that have played the fool<br> For beauty's very self, has charm made wise,<br> And many a poor man that has roved,<br> Loved and thought himself beloved,<br> From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.</p>  
<p>May she become a flourishing hidden tree<br> That all her thoughts may like the linnet be, <A NAME="page_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A><br> And have no business but dispensing round<br> Their magnanimities of sound,<br> Nor but in merriment begin a chase,<br> Nor but in merriment a quarrel.<br> Oh, may she live like some green laurel<br> Rooted in one dear perpetual place.</p>  
<p>My mind, because the minds that I have loved,<br> The sort of beauty that I have approved,<br> Prosper but little, has dried up of late,<br> Yet knows that to be choked with hate<br> May well be of all evil chances chief.<br> If there's no hatred in a mind<br> Assault and battery of the wind<br> Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.</p>  
<p>An intellectual hatred is the worst,<br> So let her think opinions are accursed.<br> Have I not seen the loveliest woman born<br> Out of the mouth of Plenty's horn,<br> Because of her opinionated mind<br> Barter that horn and every good<br> By quiet natures understood<br> For an old bellows full of angry wind?</p>  
<p>Considering that, all hatred driven hence,<br> The soul recovers radical innocence<br> And learns at last that it is self-delighting,<br> Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,<br> And that its own sweet will is heaven's will; <A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A><br> She can, though every face should scowl<br> And every windy quarter howl<br> Or every bellows burst, be happy still.</p>  
<p>And may her bride-groom bring her to a house<br> Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;<br> For arrogance and hatred are the wares<br> Peddled in the thoroughfares.<br> How but in custom and in ceremony<br> Are innocence and beauty born?<br> Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,<br> And custom for the spreading laurel tree.</p>
