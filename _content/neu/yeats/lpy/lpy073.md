### UPON A HOUSE SHAKEN BY THE LAND AGITATION

How should the world be luckier if this house,  
Where passion and precision have been one  
Time out of mind, became too ruinous  
To breed the lidless eye that loves the sun?  
And the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow  
Where wings have memory of wings, and all  
That comes of the best knit to the best? Although  
Mean roof-trees were the sturdier for its fall,  
How should their luck run high enough to reach  
The gifts that govern men, and after these  
To gradual Time's last gift, a written speech  
Wrought of high laughter, loveliness and ease?
