<p>I AM worn out with dreams;<br> A weather-worn, marble triton<br> Among the streams;<br> And all day long I look<br> Upon this lady's beauty<br> As though I had found in book<br> A pictured beauty,<br> Pleased to have filled the eyes<br> Or the discerning ears,<br> Delighted to be but wise,<br> For men improve with the years;<br> And yet and yet<br> Is this my dream, or the truth?<br> O would that we had met<br> When I had my burning youth;<br> But I grow old among dreams,<br> A weather-worn, marble triton<br> Among the streams.</p>
