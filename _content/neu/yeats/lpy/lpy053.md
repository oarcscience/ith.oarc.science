### O DO NOT LOVE TOO LONG

SWEETHEART, do not love too long:  
I loved long and long,  
And grew to be out of fashion  
Like an old song.

All through the years of our youth  
Neither could have known  
Their own thought from the other's,  
We were so much at one.

But, O in a minute she changed--  
O do not love too long,  
Or you will grow out of fashion  
Like an old song.

Themselves](lpy054)
