### AGAINST UNWORTHY PRAISE

O HEART, be at peace, because  
Nor knave nor dolt can break  
What's not for their applause,  
Being for a woman's sake.  
Enough if the work has seemed,  
So did she your strength renew,  
A dream that a lion had dreamed  
Till the wilderness cried aloud,  
A secret between you two,  
Between the proud and the proud.

What, still you would have their praise!  
But here's a haughtier text,  
The labyrinth of her days  
That her own strangeness perplexed;  
And how what her dreaming gave  
Earned slander, ingratitude,  
From self-same dolt and knave;  
Aye, and worse wrong than these.  
Yet she, singing upon her road,  
Half lion, half child, is at peace.
