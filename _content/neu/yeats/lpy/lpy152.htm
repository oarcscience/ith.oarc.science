<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>OPINION Is not worth a rush;<br> In this altar-piece the knight,<br> Who grips his long spear so to push<br> That dragon through the fading light,<br> Loved the lady; and it's plain<br> The half-dead dragon was her thought,<br> That every morning rose again<br> And dug its claws and shrieked and fought.<br> Could the impossible come to pass<br> She would have time to turn her eyes,<br> Her lover thought, upon the glass<br> And on the instant would grow wise.</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>You mean they argued.</p>  
<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put it so;<br> But bear in mind your lover's wage <A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A><br> Is what your looking-glass can show,<br> And that he will turn green with rage<br> At all that is not pictured there.</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>May I not put myself to college?</p>  
<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>Go pluck Athena by the hair;<br> For what mere book can grant a knowledge<br> With an impassioned gravity<br> Appropriate to that beating breast,<br> That vigorous thigh, that dreaming eye?<br> And may the devil take the rest.</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>And must no beautiful woman be<br> Learned like a man?</p>  
<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Veronese<br> And all his sacred company<br> Imagined bodies all their days<br> By the lagoon you love so much,<br> For proud, soft, ceremonious proof<br> That all must come to sight and touch;<br> While Michael Angelo's Sistine roof <A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A><br> His "Morning" and his "Night" disclose<br> How sinew that has been pulled tight,<br> Or it may be loosened in repose,<br> Can rule by supernatural right<br> Yet be but sinew.</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard said<br> There is great danger in the body.</p>  
<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>Did God in portioning wine and bread<br> Give man His thought or His mere body?</p>  
<p align="center">SHE</p>  
<p>My wretched dragon is perplexed.</p>  
<p align="center">HE</p>  
<p>I have principles to prove me right,<br> It follows from this Latin text<br> That blest souls are not composite,<br> And that all beautiful women may<br> Live in uncomposite blessedness,<br> And lead us to the like--if they<br> Will banish every thought, unless<br> The lineaments that please their view <A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A><br> When the long looking-glass is full,<br> Even from the foot-sole think it too.</p>

<p>They say such different things at school.</p>
