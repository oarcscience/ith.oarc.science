<p>ONE that is ever kind said yesterday:<br> "Your well-beloved's hair has threads of grey,<br> And little shadows come about her eyes;<br> Time can but make it easier to be wise<br> Though now it seem impossible, and so<br> Patience is all that you have need of."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No,<br> I have not a crumb of comfort, not a grain,<br> Time can but make her beauty over again:<br> Because of that great nobleness of hers<br> The fire that stirs about her, when she stirs<br> Burns but more clearly. O she had not these ways,<br> When all the wild summer was in her gaze.<br> O heart! O heart! if she'd but turn her head,<br> You'd know the folly of being comforted.</p>
