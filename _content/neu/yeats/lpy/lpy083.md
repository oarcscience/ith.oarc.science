### TO A WEALTHY MAN WHO PROMISED A SECOND SUBSCRIPTION TO THE DUBLIN MUNICIPAL GALLERY IF IT WERE PROVED THE PEOPLE WANTED PICTURES

You gave but will not give again  
Until enough of Paudeen's pence  
By Biddy's halfpennies have lain  
To be "some sort of evidence,"  
Before you'll put your guineas down,  
That things it were a pride to give  
Are what the blind and ignorant town  
Imagines best to make it thrive.  
What cared Duke Ercole, that bid  
His mummers to the market place,  
What th’ onion-sellers thought or did  
So that his Plautus set the pace  
For the Italian comedies?  
And Guidobaldo, when he made  
That grammar school of courtesies  
Where wit and beauty learned their trade  
Upon Urbino's windy hill,  
Had sent no runners to and fro  
That he might learn the shepherds' will. <span id="page_194">p.

And when they drove out Cosimo,  
Indifferent how the rancour ran,  
He gave the hours they had set free  
To Michelozzo's latest plan  
For the San Marco Library,  
Whence turbulent Italy should draw  
Delight in Art whose end is peace,  
In logic and in natural law  
By sucking at the dugs of Greece.

Your open hand but shows our loss,  
For he knew better how to live.  
Let Paudeens play at pitch and toss,  
Look up in the sun's eye and give  
What the exultant heart calls good  
That some new day may breed the best  
Because you gave, not what they would  
But the right twigs for an eagle's nest!

*December* 1912.
