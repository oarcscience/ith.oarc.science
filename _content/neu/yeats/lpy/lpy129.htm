<p>ALTHOUGH I can see him still<br> The freckled man who goes<br> To a grey place on a hill<br> In grey Connemara clothes<br> At dawn to cast his flies,<br> It's long since I began<br> To call up to the eyes<br> This wise and simple man.<br> All day I'd looked in the face<br> What I had hoped &#8217;twould be<br> To write for my own race<br> And the reality;<br> The living men that I hate,<br> The dead man that I loved,<br> The craven man in his seat,<br> The insolent unreproved<br> And no knave brought to book<br> Who has won a drunken cheer,<br> The witty man and his joke<br> Aimed at the commonest ear,<br> The clever man who cries<br> The catch-cries of the clown,<br> The beating down of the wise<br> And great Art beaten down. <A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A><br> Maybe a twelvemonth since<br> Suddenly I began,<br> In scorn of this audience<br> Imagining a man,<br> And his sun-freckled face,<br> And grey Connemara cloth,<br> Climbing up to a place<br> Where stone is dark under froth,<br> And the down turn of his wrist<br> When the flies drop in the stream;<br> A man who does not exist,<br> A man who is but a dream;<br> And cried, "Before I am old<br> I shall have written him one<br> Poem maybe as cold<br> And passionate as the dawn."</p>
