### TOM O'ROUGHLEY

"THOUGH logic choppers rule the town,  
And every man and maid and boy  
Has marked a distant object down,  
An aimless joy is a pure joy,"  
Or so did Tom O'Roughley say  
That saw the surges running by,  
"And wisdom is a butterfly  
And not a gloomy bird of prey.

"If little planned is little sinned  
But little need the grave distress.  
What's dying but a second wind?  
How but in zig-zag wantonness  
Could trumpeter Michael be so brave?"  
Or something of that sort he said,  
"And if my dearest friend were dead  
I'd dance a measure on his grave."
