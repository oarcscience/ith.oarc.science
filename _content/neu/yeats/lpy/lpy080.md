# RESPONSIBILITIES (1914)

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

"*In dreams begins responsibility*."  
                   *Old Play*.

"*How am I fallen from myself, for a long time now  
I have not seen the Prince of Chang in my dreams*."  
                           *Khoung-fou-tseu*.

*PARDON, old fathers, if you still remain  
Somewhere in ear-shot for the story's end,  
Old Dublin merchant "free of ten and four"  
Or trading out of Galway into Spain;  
And country scholar, Robert Emmet's friend,  
A hundred-year-old memory to the poor;  
Traders or soldiers who have left me blood  
That has not passed through any huxter's loin,  
Pardon, and you that did not weigh the cost,  
Old Butlers when you took to horse and stood  
Beside the brackish waters of the Boyne  
Till your bad master blenched and all was lost;  
You merchant skipper that leaped overboard  
After a ragged hat in Biscay Bay,  
You most of all, silent and fierce old man  
Because you were the spectacle that stirred  
My fancy, and set my boyish lips to say  
"Only the wasteful virtues earn the sun ";  
Pardon that for a barren passion's sake,  
Although I have come close on forty-nine  
I have no child, I have nothing but a book,  
Nothing but that to prove your blood and mine*.

*January* 1914.
