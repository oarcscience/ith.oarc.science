    SAGA OF OLAF KYRRE.



    PRELIMINARY REMARKS.

    Snorri's account of Olaf Kyrre corresponds with the statements
    found in "Agrip", "Fagrskinna", and "Morkinskinna".

    There are but few events in Olaf's long reign, and hence he is
    very appropriately called the Quiet (Kyrre).  As Hildebrand says,
    this saga seems to be written simply to fill out the empty space
    between Harald Hardrade and Magnus Barefoot.

    Skalds quoted in this saga are: Stein Herdison and Stuf.



    1. OLAF'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE.

    Olaf remained sole king of Norway after the death (A.D. 1069) of
    his brother King Magnus.  Olaf was a stout man, well grown in
    limbs; and every one said a handsomer man could not be seen, nor
    of a nobler appearance.  His hair was yellow as silk, and became
    him well; his skin was white and fine over all his body; his eyes
    beautiful, and his limbs well proportioned.  He was rather silent
    in general, and did not speak much even at Things; but he was
    merry in drinking parties.  He loved drinking much, and was
    talkative enough then; but quite peaceful.  He was cheerful in
    conversation, peacefully inclined during all his reign, and
    loving gentleness and moderation in all things.  Stein Herdison
    speaks thus of him: --

         "Our Throndhjem king is brave and wise,
         His love of peace our bondes prize;
         By friendly word and ready hand
         He holds good peace through every land.
         He is for all a lucky star;
         England he frightens from a war;
         The stiff-necked Danes he drives to peace;
         Troubles by his good influence cease."



    2. OF KING OLAF'S MANNER OF LIVING.

    It was the fashion in Norway in old times for the king's high-
    seat to be on the middle of a long bench, and the ale was handed
    across the fire (1); but King Olaf had his high-seat made on a
    high bench across the room; he also first had chimney-places in
    the rooms, and the floors strewed both summer and winter.  In
    King Olaf's time many merchant towns arose in Norway, and many
    new ones were founded.  Thus King Olaf founded a merchant town at
    Bergen, where very soon many wealthy people settled themselves,
    and it was regularly frequented by merchants from foreign lands.
    He had the foundations laid for the large Christ church, which
    was to be a stone church; but in his time there was little done
    to it.  Besides, he completed the old Christ church, which was of
    wood.  King Olaf also had a great feasting-house built in
    Nidaros, and in many other merchant towns, where before there
    were only private feasts; and in his time no one could drink in
    Norway but in these houses, adorned for the purpose with branches
    and leaves, and which stood under the king's protection.  The
    great guild-bell in Throndhjem, which was called the pride of the
    town, tolled to call together to these guilds.  The guild-
    brethren built Margaret's church in Nidaros of stone.  In King
    Olaf's time there were general entertainments and hand-in-hand
    feasts.  At this time also much unusual splendour and foreign
    customs and fashions in the cut of clothes were introduced; as,
    for instance, costly hose plaited about the legs.  Some had gold
    rings about the legs, and also used coats which had lists down
    the sides, and arms five ells long, and so narrow that they must
    be drawn up with ties, and lay in folds all the way up to the
    shoulders.  The shoes were high, and all edged with silk, or even
    with gold.  Many other kinds of wonderful ornaments were used at
    that time.


    ENDNOTES:
    (1)  We may understand the arrangement by supposing the fire in
         the middle of the room, the smoke escaping by a hole in the
         roof, and a long bench on each side of the fire; one bench
         occupied by the high-seat of the king and great guests, the
         other by the rest of the guests; and the cup handed across
         the fire, which appears to have had a religious meaning
         previous to the introduction of Christianity. -- L.



    3. FASHION OF KING OLAF'S COURT.

    King Olaf used the fashion, which was introduced from the courts
    of foreign kings, of letting his grand-butler stand at the end of
    the table, and fill the table-cups for himself and the other
    distinguished guests who sat at the table.  He had also torch-
    bearers, who held as many candles at the table as there were
    guests of distinction present.  There was also a marshal's bench
    outside of the table-circle, where the marshal and other persons
    of distinction sat with their faces towards the high-seat.  King
    Harald, and the kings before him, used to drink out of deer-horn;
    and the ale was handed from the high-seat to the otherside over
    the fire, and he drank to the memory of any one he thought of. 
    So says Stuf the skald: --

         "He who in battle is the first,
         And now in peace is best to trust,
         A welcome, hearty and sincere,
         Gave to me on my coming here.
         He whom the ravens watch with care,
         He who the gold rings does not spare,
         A golden horn full to the brink
         Gave me himself at Haug to drink."



    4. ARRANGEMENT OF KING OLAF'S COURT.

    King Olaf had 120 courtmen-at-arms, and 60 pursuivants, besides
    60 house-servants, who provided what was wanted for the king's
    house wherever it might be, or did other work required for the
    king.  When the bondes asked why he kept a greater retinue than
    the law allowed, or former kings kept when they went in guest-
    quarters or feasts which the bondes had to provide for them, the
    king answered, "It does not happen that I rule the kingdom
    better, or produce greater respect for me than ye had for my
    father, although I have one-half more people than he had.  I do
    not by any means do it merely to plague you, or to make your
    condition harder than formerly."



    5. KING SVEIN ULFSON'S DEATH.

    King Svein Ulfson died ten years after the fall of both the
    Haralds (A.D. 1076).  After him his son, Harald Hein, was king
    for three years (A.D. 1077-1080); then Canute the Holy for seven
    years (A.D. 1081-1087); afterwards Olaf, King Svein's third son,
    for eight years (A.D. 1088-1095).  Then Eirik the Good, Svein's
    fourth son, for eight winters (A.D. 1096-1103).  Olaf, the king
    of Norway, was married to Ingerid, a daughter of Svein, the
    Danish king; and Olaf, the Danish King Svein's son, married
    Ingegerd, a daughter of King Harald, and sister of King Olaf of
    Norway.  King Olaf Haraldson, who was called by some Olaf Kyrre,
    but by many Olaf the Bonde, had a son by Thora, Joan's daughter,
    who was called Magnus, and was one of the handsomest lads that
    could be seen, and was promising in every respect.  He was
    brought up in the king's court.



    6. MIRACLES OF KING OLAF THE SAINT.

    King Olaf had a church of stone built in Nidaros, on the spot
    where King Olaf's body had first been buried, and the altar was
    placed directly over the spot where the king's grave had been.
    This church was consecrated and called Christ Church; and King
    Olaf's shrine was removed to it, and was placed before the altar,
    and many miracles took place there.  The following summer, on the 
    same day of the year as the church was consecrated, which was the
    day before Olafsmas, there was a great assemblage of people, and
    then a blind man was restored to sight.  And on the mass-day
    itself, when the shrine and the holy relics were taken out and
    carried, and the shrine itself, according to custom, was taken
    and set down in the churchyard, a man who had long been dumb
    recovered his speech again, and sang with flowing tongue praise-
    hymns to God, and to the honour of King Olaf the Saint.  The
    third miracle was of a woman who had come from Svithjod, and had
    suffered much distress on this pilgrimage from her blindness; but
    trusting in God's mercy, had come travelling to this solemnity.
    She was led blind into the church to hear mass this day; but
    before the service was ended she saw with both eyes, and got her
    sight fully and clearly, although she had been blind fourteen
    years.  She returned with great joy, praising God and King Olaf 
    the Saint.



    7. OF THE SHRINE OF KING OLAF THE SAINT.

    There happened a circumstance in Nidaros, when King Olaf's coffin
    was being carried about through the streets, that it became so
    heavy that people could not lift it from the spot.  Now when the
    coffin was set down, the street was broken up to see what was
    under it at that spot, and the body of a child was found which
    had been murdered and concealed there.  The body was carried
    away, the street put in order again as it had been before, and
    the shrine carried on according to custom.



    8. KING OLAF WAS BLESSED WITH PEACE.

    In the days of King O1af there were bountiful harvests in Norway
    and many good things.  In no man's life had times been so good in
    Norway since the days of Harald Harfager.  King O1af modified for
    the better many a matter that his father had inaugurated and
    maintained with severity.  He was generous, but a strict ruler,
    for he was a wise man, and well understood what was of advantage
    to the kingdom.  There are many stories of his good works.  How
    much he loved and how kind he was to the people may be seen from
    the following words, which he once spoke at a large banquet.  He
    was happy and in the best of spirits, when one of his men said,
    "It pleases us, sire, to see you so happy."  He answered: "I have
    reason to be glad when I see my subjects sitting happy and free
    in a guild consecrated to my uncle, the sainted King Olaf.  In
    the days of my father these people were subjected to much terror
    and fear; the most of them concealed their gold and their
    precious things, but now I see glittering on his person what each
    one owns, and your freedom is my gladness.  In his reign there
    was no strife, and he protected himself and his realm against
    enemies abroad; and his nearest neighbours stood in great awe of
    him, although he was a most gentle man, as is confirmed by the
    skald.



    9. MEETING OF OLAF KYRRE AND CANUTE THE SAINT.

    King Olaf Kyrre was a great friend of his brother-in-law, the
    Danish king, Canute the holy.  They appointed a meeting and met
    at the Gaut river at Konungahella, where the kings used to have
    their meetings.  There King Canute made the proposal that they
    should send an army westward to England on account of the revenge
    they had to take there; first and foremost King Olaf himself, and
    also the Danish king.  "Do one of two things," said King Canute,
    -- "either take sixty ships, which I will furnish thee with, and
    be thou the leader; or give me sixty ships, and I shall be the
    leader."  Then said King Olaf, "This speech of thine, King
    Canute, is altogether according to my mind; but there is this
    great difference between us; your family has had more luck in
    conquering England with great glory, and, among others, King
    Canute the Great; and it is likely that this good fortune follows
    your race.  On the other hand, when King Harald, my father, went
    westward to England, he got his death there; and at that time the
    best men in Norway followed him.  But Norway was so emptied then
    of chosen men, that such men have not since been to find in the
    country; for that expedition there was the most excellent outfit,
    and you know what was the end of it.  Now I know my own capacity,
    and how little I am suited to be the leader; so I would rather
    you should go, with my help and assistance."

    So King Olaf gave Canute sixty large ships, with excellent
    equipment and faithful men, and set his lendermen as chiefs over
    them; and all must allow that this armament was admirably equipt.
    It is also told in the saga about Canute, that the Northmen alone
    did not break the levy when the army was assembled, but the Danes
    would not obey their king's orders.  This king Canute
    acknowledged, and gave them leave to trade in merchandise where
    they pleased through his country, and at the same time sent the
    king of Norway costly presents for his assistance.  On the other
    hand he was enraged against the Danes, and laid heavy fines upon
    them.



    10. A BONDE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE LANGUAGE OF BIRDS.

    One summer, when King Olaf's men had gone round the country
    collecting his income and land dues, it happened that the king,
    on their return home asked them where on their expedition they
    had been best entertained.  They said it was in the house of a
    bonde in one of the king's districts.  "There is an old bonde
    there who knows many things before they happen.  We asked him
    about many things, which he explained to us; nay, we even believe
    that he understands perfectly the language of birds."  The king
    replies, "How can ye believe such nonsense?" and insisted that it
    was wrong to put confidence in such things.  It happened soon
    after that the king was sailing along the coast; and as they
    sailed through a Sound the king said, "What is that township up
    in the country?"

    They replied, "That is the district, sire, where we told you we
    were best entertained."

    Then said the king, "What house is that which stands up there,
    not far from the Sound?"

    They replied, "That house belongs to the wise old bonde we told
    you of, sire."

    They saw now a horse standing close to the house.  Then said the
    king, "Go there, and take that horse, and kill him."

    They replied, "We would not like to do him such harm."

    The king: "I will command.  Cut off the horse's head; but take
    care of yourselves that ye let no blood come to the ground, and
    bear the horse out to my ship.  Go then and bring to me the old
    man; but tell him nothing of what has happened, as ye shall
    answer for it with your lives."

    They did as they were ordered, and then came to the old man, and
    told him the king's message.  When he came before the king, the
    king asked him, "Who owns the house thou art dwelling in?"

    He replies, "Sire, you own it, and take rent for it."

    The king: "Show us the way round the ness, for here thou must be
    a good pilot."

    The old man went into his boat and rowed before the king's ship;
    and when he had rowed a little way a crow came flying over the
    ship, and croaking hideously.  The peasant listens to the crow.
    The king said, "Do you think, bonde, that betokens anything?"

    "Sire, that is certain," said he.

    Then another crow flies over the ship, and screeches dreadfully.
    The bonde was so ill hearing this that he could not row, and the
    oars hung loose in his hands.

    Then said the king, "Thy mind is turned much to these crows,
    bonde, and to what they say."

    The bonde replies, "Now I suspect it is true what they say."

    The third time the crow came flying screeching at its very worst,
    and almost settling on the ship.  Now the bonde threw down his
    oars, regarded them no more, and stood up before the king.

    Then the king said, "Thou art taking this much to heart, bonde;
    what is it they say?"

    The peasant -- "It is likely that either they or I have
    misunderstood -- "

    "Say on," replied the king.

    The bonde replied in a song: --

         "The `one-year old'
         Mere nonsense told;
         The `two-years' chatter
         Seemed senseless matter;
         The three-years' croak
         Of wonders spoke.
         The foul bird said
         My old mare's head
         I row along;
         And, in her song,
         She said the thief
         Was the land's chief."

    The king said, "What is this, bonde!  Wilt thou call me a thief?"

    Then the king gave him good presents, and remitted all the land-
    rent of the place he lived on.  So says Stein: --

         "The pillar of our royal race
         Stands forth adorned with every grace.
         What king before e'er took such pride
         To scatter bounty far and wide?
         Hung round with shields that gleam afar;
         The merchant ship on one bestows,
         With painted streaks in glowing rows.

         "The man-at-arms a golden ring
         Boasts as the present of his king;
         At the king's table sits the guest,
         By the king's bounty richly drest.
         King Olaf, Norway's royal son,
         Who from the English glory won,
         Pours out with ready-giving hand
         His wealth on children of the land.

         "Brave clothes to servants he awards,
         Helms and ring-mail coats grace his guards;
         Or axe and sword Har's warriors gain,
         And heavy armour for the plain.
         Gold, too, for service duly paid,
         Red gold all pure, and duly weighed,
         King Olaf gives -- be loves to pay
         All service in a royal way."



    11. OF KING OLAF KYRRE'S DEATH.

    King Olaf lived principally in his domains on his large farms.
    Once when he was east in Ranrike, on his estate of Haukby, he
    took the disease which ended in his death.  He had then been king
    of Norway for twenty-six years (A.D. 1068-1093); for he was made
    king of Norway the year after King Harald's death.  King Olaf's
    body was taken north to Nidaros, and buried in Christ church,
    which he himself had built there.  He was the most amiable king
    of his time, and Norway was much improved in riches and
    cultivation during his reign.
