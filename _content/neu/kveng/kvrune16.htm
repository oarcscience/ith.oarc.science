<p>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> For his boat was working lumber,<br> Working long upon his vessel,<br> On a fog-point jutting seaward,<br> On an island, forest-covered;<br> But the lumber failed the master,<br> Beams were wanting for his vessel,<br> Beams and scantling, ribs and flooring.<br> Who will find for him the lumber,<br> Who procure the timber needed<br> For the boat of Wainamoinen,<br> For the bottom of his vessel?</p> 
<p>Pellerwoinen of the prairies,<br> Sampsa, slender-grown and ancient,<br> He will seek the needful timber,<br> He procure the beams of oak-wood<br> For the boat of Wainamoinen,<br> For the bottom of his vessel.</p> 
<p>Soon he starts upon his journey<br> To the eastern fields and forests,<br> Hunts throughout the Northland mountain<br> To a second mountain wanders,<br> To a third he hastens, searching,<br> Golden axe upon his shoulder,<br> In his hand a copper hatchet.<br> Comes an aspen-tree to meet him<br> Of the height of seven fathoms.<br> Sampsa takes his axe of copper,<br> Starts to fell the stately aspen,<br> But the aspen quickly halting,<br> Speaks these words to Pellerwoinen:<br> "Tell me, hero, what thou wishest,<br> What the service thou art needing?"<br> Sampsa Pellerwoinen answers:<br> "This indeed, the needed service<br> That I ask of thee, O aspen:<br> Need thy lumber for a vessel,<br> For the boat of Wainamoinen,<br> Wisest of the wisdom-singers."</p> 
<p>Quick and wisely speaks the aspen,<br> Thus its hundred branches answer:<br> "All the boats that have been fashioned<br> From my wood have proved but failures;<br> Such a vessel floats a distance,<br> Then it sinks upon the bottom<br> Of the waters it should travel.<br> All my trunk is filled with hollows,<br> Three times in the summer seasons<br> Worms devour my stem and branches,<br> Feed upon my heart and tissues."</p> 
<p>Pellerwoinen leaves the aspen,<br> Hunts again through all the forest,<br> Wanders through the woods of Northland,<br> Where a pine-tree comes to meet him,<br> Of the height of fourteen fathoms.</p> 
<p>With his axe he chops the pine-tree,<br> Strikes it with his axe of copper,<br> As he asks the pine this question:<br> "Will thy trunk give worthy timber<br> For the boat of Wainamoinen,<br> Wisest of the wisdom-singers?"<br> Loudly does the pine-tree answer:<br> "All the ships that have been fashioned<br> From my body are unworthy;<br> I am full of imperfections,<br> Cannot give thee needed timber<br> Wherewithal to build thy vessel;<br> Ravens live within ray branches,<br> Build their nests and hatch their younglings<br> Three times in my trunk in summer."</p> 
<p>Sampsa leaves the lofty pine-tree,<br> Wanders onward, onward, onward,<br> To the woods of gladsome summer,<br> Where an oak-tree comes to meet him,<br> In circumference, three fathoms,<br> And the oak he thus addresses:<br> "Ancient oak-tree, will thy body<br> Furnish wood to build a vessel,<br> Build a boat for Wainamoinen,<br> Master-boat for the magician,<br> Wisest of the wisdom-singers?"<br> Thus the oak replies to Sampsa:<br> "I for thee will gladly furnish<br> Wood to build the hero's vessel;<br> I am tall, and sound, and hardy,<br> Have no flaws within my body;<br> Three times in the months of summer,<br> In the warmest of the seasons,<br> Does the sun dwell in my tree-top,<br> On my trunk the moonlight glimmers,<br> In my branches sings the cuckoo,<br> In my top her nestlings slumber."</p> 
<p>Now the ancient Pellerwoinen<br> Takes the hatchet from his shoulder,<br> Takes his axe with copper handle,<br> Chops the body of the oak-tree;<br> Well he knows the art of chopping.<br> Soon he fells the tree majestic,<br> Fells the mighty forest-monarch,<br> With his magic axe and power.<br> From the stems he lops the branches,<br> Splits the trunk in many pieces,<br> Fashions lumber for the bottom,<br> Countless boards, and ribs, and braces,<br> For the singer's magic vessel,<br> For the boat of the magician.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and skilful,<br> The eternal wonder-worker,<br> Builds his vessel with enchantment,<br> Builds his boat by art of magic,<br> From the timber of the oak-tree,<br> From its posts, and planks, and flooring.<br> Sings a song, and joins the frame-work;<br> Sings a second, sets the siding;<br> Sings a third time, sets the row-locks;<br> Fashions oars, and ribs, and rudder,<br> Joins the sides and ribs together.<br> When the ribs were firmly fastened,<br> When the sides were tightly jointed,<br> Then alas! three words were wanting,<br> Lost the words of master-magic,<br> How to fasten in the ledges,<br> How the stern should be completed,<br> How complete the boat's forecastle.</p> 
<p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Wise and wonderful enchanter,<br> Heavy-hearted spake as follows:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br> Never will this magic vessel<br> Pass in safety o'er the water,<br> Never ride the rough sea-billows."</p> 
<p>Then he thought and long considered,<br> Where to find these words of magic,<br> Find the lost-words of the Master:<br> "From the brains of countless swallows,<br> From the heads of swans in dying,<br> From the plumage of the gray-duck?"</p> 
<p>For these words the hero searches,<br> Kills of swans a goodly number,<br> Kills a flock of fattened gray-duck,<br> Kills of swallows countless numbers,<br> Cannot find the words of magic,<br> Not the lost-words of the Master.<br> Wainamoinen, wisdom-singer,<br> Still reflected and debated:<br> "I perchance may find the lost-words<br> On the tongue of summer-reindeer,<br> In the mouth of the white squirrel."</p> 
<p>Now again he hunts the lost-words,<br> Hastes to find the magic sayings,<br> Kills a countless host of reindeer,<br> Kills a rafterful of squirrels,<br> Finds of words a goodly number,<br> But they are of little value,<br> Cannot find the magic lost-word.<br> Long he thought and well considered:<br> "I can find of words a hundred<br> In the dwellings of Tuoni,<br> In the Manala fields and castles."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen quickly journeys<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> There to find the ancient wisdom,<br> There to learn the secret doctrine;<br> Hastens on through fen and forest,<br> Over meads and over marshes,<br> Through the ever-rising woodlands,<br> Journeys one week through the brambles,<br> And a second through the hazels,<br> Through the junipers the third week,<br> When appear Tuoni's islands,<br> And the Manala fields and castles.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, brave and ancient,<br> Calls aloud in tones of thunder,<br> To the Tuonela deeps and dungeons,<br> And to Manala's magic castle:<br> "Bring a boat, Tuoni's daughter,<br> Bring a ferry-boat, O maiden,<br> That may bear me o'er this channel,<br> O'er this black and fatal river."</p> 
<p>Quick the daughter of Tuoni,<br> Magic maid of little stature,<br> Tiny virgin of Manala,<br> Tiny washer of the linen,<br> Tiny cleaner of the dresses,<br> At the river of Tuoni,<br> In Manala's ancient castles,<br> Speaks these words to Wainamoinen,<br> Gives this answer to his calling:<br> "Straightway will I bring the row-boat,<br> When the reasons thou hast given<br> Why thou comest to Manala<br> In a hale and active body."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and artful.,<br> Gives this answer to the maiden:<br> "I was brought here by Tuoni,<br> Mana raised me from the coffin."<br> Speaks the maiden of Manala:<br> "This a tale of wretched liars;<br> Had Tuoni brought thee hither,<br> Mana raised thee from the coffin,<br> Then Tuoni would be with thee,<br> Manalainen too would lead thee,<br> With Tuoni's hat upon thee,<br> On thy hands, the gloves of Mana;<br> Tell the truth now, Wainamoinen,<br> What has brought thee to Manala?"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, artful hero,<br> Gives this answer, still finessing:<br> "Iron brought me to Manala,<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni."</p> 
<p>Speaks the virgin of the death-land,<br> Mana's wise and tiny daughter:<br> "Well I know that this is falsehood,<br> Had the iron brought thee hither,<br> Brought thee to Tuoni's kingdom,<br> Blood would trickle from thy vesture,<br> And the blood-drops, scarlet-colored.<br> Speak the truth now, Wainamoinen,<br> This the third time that I ask thee."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, little heeding,<br> Still finesses to the daughter:<br> "Water brought me to Manala,<br> To the kingdom of Tuoui."<br> This the tiny maiden's answer:<br> "Well I know thou speakest falsely;<br> If the waters of Manala,<br> If the cataract and whirlpool,<br> Or the waves had brought thee hither,<br> From thy robes the drops would trickle,<br> Water drip from all thy raiment.<br> Tell the truth and I will serve thee,<br> What has brought thee to Manala?"</p> 
<p>Then the wilful Wainamoinen<br> Told this falsehood to the maiden:<br> "Fire has brought me to Manala,<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni."<br> Spake again Tuoni's daughter:<br> "Well I know the voice of falsehood.<br> If the fire had brought thee hither,<br> Brought thee to Tuoni's empire,<br> Singed would be thy locks and eyebrows,<br> And thy beard be crisped and tangled.<br> O, thou foolish Wainamoinen,<br> If I row thee o'er the ferry,<br> Thou must speak the truth in answer,<br> This the last time I will ask thee;<br> Make an end of thy deception.<br> What has brought thee to Manala,<br> Still unharmed by pain or sickness,<br> Still untouched by Death's dark angel<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "At the first I spake, not truly,<br> Now I give thee rightful answer:<br> I a boat with ancient wisdom,<br> Fashioned with my powers of magic,<br> Sang one day and then a second,<br> Sang the third day until evening,<br> When I broke the magic main-spring,<br> Broke my magic sledge in pieces,<br> Of my song the fleetest runners;<br> Then I come to Mana's kingdom,<br> Came to borrow here a hatchet,<br> Thus to mend my sledge of magic,<br> Thus to join the parts together.<br> Send the boat now quickly over,<br> Send me, quick, Tuoni's row-boat,<br> Help me cross this fatal river,<br> Cross the channel of Manala."</p> 
<p>Spake the daughter of Tuoni,<br> Mana's maiden thus replying:<br> "Thou art sure a stupid fellow,<br> Foresight wanting, judgment lacking,<br> Having neither wit nor wisdom,<br> Coming here without a reason,<br> Coming to Tuoni's empire;<br> Better far if thou shouldst journey<br> To thy distant home and kindred;<br> Man they that visit Mana,<br> Few return from Maria's kingdom."</p> 
<p>Spake the good old Wainamoinen:<br> "Women old retreat from danger,<br> Not a man of any courage,<br> Not the weakest of the heroes.<br> Bring thy boat, Tuoni's daughter,<br> Tiny maiden of Manala,<br> Come and row me o'er the ferry."</p> 
<p>Mana's daughter does as bidden,<br> Brings her boat to Wainamoinen,<br> Quickly rows him through the channel,<br> O'er the black and fatal river,<br> To the kingdom of Manala,<br> Speaks these words to the magician:<br> "Woe to thee! O Wainamoinen!<br> Wonderful indeed, thy magic,<br> Since thou comest to Manala,<br> Comest neither dead nor dying."</p> 
<p>Tuonetar, the death-land hostess,<br> Ancient hostess of Tuoni,<br> Brings him pitchers filled with strong-beer,<br> Fills her massive golden goblets,<br> Speaks these measures to the stranger:<br> "Drink, thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Drink the beer of king Tuoni!"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, wise and cautious,<br> Carefully inspects the liquor,<br> Looks a long time in the pitchers,<br> Sees the spawning of the black-frogs,<br> Sees the young of poison-serpents,<br> Lizards, worms, and writhing adders,<br> Thus addresses Tuonetar:<br> "Have not come with this intention,<br> Have not come to drink thy poisons,<br> Drink the beer of Tuonela;<br> Those that drink Tuoni's liquors,<br> Those that sip the cups of Mana,<br> Court the Devil and destruction,<br> End their lives in want and ruin."<br> Tuonetar makes this answer:<br> "Ancient minstrel, Wainamoinen,<br> Tell me what has brought thee hither,<br> Brought thee to the, realm of Mana,<br> To the courts of Tuonela,<br> Ere Tuoni sent his angels<br> To thy home in Kalevala,<br> There to cut thy magic life-thread."<br> Spake the singer, Wainamoinen:<br> "I was building me a vessel,<br> At my craft was working, singing,<br> Needed three words of the Master,<br> How to fasten in the ledges,<br> How the stern should be completed,<br> How complete the boat's forecastle.<br> This the reason of my coming<br> To the empire of Tuoni,<br> To the castles of Manala:<br> Came to learn these magic sayings,<br> Learn the lost-words of the Master."<br> Spake the hostess, Tuonetar:<br> "Mana never gives these sayings,<br> Canst not learn them from Tuoni,<br> Not the lost-words of the Master;<br> Thou shalt never leave this kingdom,<br> Never in thy magic life-time,<br> Never go to Kalevala,<br> To Wainola's peaceful meadows.<br> To thy distant home and country."</p> 
<p>Quick the hostess, Tuonetar,<br> Waves her magic wand of slumber<br> O'er the head of Wainamoinen,<br> Puts to rest the wisdom-hero,<br> Lays him on the couch of Mana,<br> In the robes of living heroes,<br> Deep the sleep that settles o'er him.<br> In Manala lived a woman,<br> In the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> Evil witch and toothless wizard,<br> Spinner of the threads of iron,<br> Moulder of the bands of copper,<br> Weaver of a hundred fish-nets,<br> Of a thousand nets of copper,<br> Spinning in the days of summer,<br> Weaving in the winter evenings,<br> Seated on a rock in water.</p> 
<p>In the kingdom of Tuoni<br> Lived a man, a wicked wizard,<br> Three the fingers of the hero,<br> Spinner he of iron meshes,<br> Maker too of nets of copper,<br> Countless were his nets of metal,<br> Moulded on a rock in water,<br> Through the many days of summer.</p> 
<p>Mana's son with crooked fingers,<br> Iron-pointed, copper fingers,<br> Pulls of nets, at least a thousand,<br> Through the river of Tuoni,<br> Sets them lengthwise, sets them crosswise,<br> In the fatal, darksome river,<br> That the sleeping Wainamomen,<br> Friend and brother of the waters,<br> May not leave the isle of Mana,<br> Never in the course of ages,<br> Never leave the death-land castles,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers<br> On the empire of Tuoni.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, wise and wary,<br> Rising from his couch of slumber,<br> Speaks these words as he is waking:<br> "Is there not some mischief brewing,<br> Am I not at last in danger,<br> In the chambers of Tuoni,<br> In the Manala home and household?"</p> 
<p>Quick he changes his complexion,<br> Changes too his form and feature,<br> Slips into another body;<br> Like a serpent in a circle,<br> Rolls black-dyed upon the waters;<br> Like a snake among the willows,<br> Crawls he like a worm of magic,<br> Like an adder through the grasses,<br> Through the coal-black stream of death-land,<br> Through a thousand nets of copper<br> Interlaced with threads of iron,<br> From the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> From the castles of Manala.</p> 
<p>Mana's son, the wicked wizard,<br> With his iron-pointed fingers,<br> In the early morning hastens<br> To his thousand nets of copper,<br> Set within the Tuoni river,<br> Finds therein a countless number<br> Of the death-stream fish and serpents;<br> Does not find old Wainamoinen,<br> Wainamoinen, wise and wary,<br> Friend and fellow of the waters.</p> 
<p>When the wonder-working hero<br> Had escaped from Tuonela,<br> Spake he thus in supplication:<br> "Gratitude to thee, O Ukko,<br> Do I bring for thy protection!<br> Never suffer other heroes,<br> Of thy heroes not the wisest,<br> To transgress the laws of nature;<br> Never let another singer,<br> While he lives within the body,<br> Cross the river of Tuoni,<br> As thou lovest thy creations.<br> Many heroes cross the channel,<br> Cross the fatal stream of Mana,<br> Few return to tell the story,<br> Few return from Tuonela,<br> From Manala's courts and castles."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen calls his people,<br> On the plains of Kalevala,<br> Speaks these words of ancient wisdom,<br> To the young men, to the maidens,<br> To the rising generation:<br> "Every child of Northland, listen:<br> If thou wishest joy eternal,<br> Never disobey thy parents,<br> Never evil treat the guiltless,<br> Never wrong the feeble-minded,<br> Never harm thy weakest fellow,<br> Never stain thy lips with falsehood,<br> Never cheat thy trusting neighbor,<br> Never injure thy companion,<br> Lest thou surely payest penance<br> In the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> In the prison of Manala;<br> There, the home of all the wicked,<br> There the couch of the unworthy,<br> There the chambers of the guilty.<br> Underneath Manala's fire-rock<br> Are their ever-flaming couches,<br> For their pillows hissing serpents,<br> Vipers green their writhing covers,<br> For their drink the blood of adders,<br> For their food the pangs of hunger,<br> Pain and agony their solace;<br> If thou wishest joy eternal,<br> Shun the kingdom of Tuoui!"</p>
