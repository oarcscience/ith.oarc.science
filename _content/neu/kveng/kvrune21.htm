<p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Ancient dame of Sariola,<br> While at work within her dwelling,<br> Heard the whips crack on the fenlands,<br> Heard the rattle of the sledges;<br> To the northward turned her glances,<br> Turned her vision to the sunlight,<br> And her thoughts ran on as follow:<br> "Who are these in bright apparel,<br> On the banks of Pohya-waters,<br> Are they friends or hostile armies?"</p> 
<p>Then the hostess of the Northland<br> Looked again and well considered,<br> Drew much nearer to examine,<br> Found they were not hostile armies,<br> Found that they were friends and suitors.<br> In the midst was Ilmarinen,<br> Son-in-law to ancient Louhi.</p> 
<p>When the hostess of Pohyola<br> Saw the son-in-law approaching<br> She addressed the words that follow:<br> "I had thought the winds were raging,<br> That the piles of wood were falling,<br> Thought the pebbles in commotion,<br> Or perchance the ocean roaring;<br> Then I hastened nearer, nearer,<br> Drew still nearer and examined,<br> Found the winds were not in battle,<br> Found the piles of wood unshaken,<br> Found the ocean was not roaring,<br> Nor the pebbles in commotion,<br> Found my son-in-law was coming<br> With his heroes and attendants,<br> Heroes counted by the hundreds.</p> 
<p>"Should you ask of me the question,<br> How I recognized the bridegroom<br> Mid the hosts of men and heroes,<br> I should answer, I should tell you:<br> 'As the hazel-bush in copses,<br> As the oak-tree in the forest,<br> As the Moon among the planets;<br> Drives the groom a coal-black courser,<br> Running like the famished black-dog,<br> Flying like the hungry raven,<br> Graceful as the lark at morning,<br> Golden cuckoos, six in number,<br> Twitter on the birchen cross-bow;<br> There are seven bluebirds singing<br> On the racer's hame and collar."</p> 
<p>Noises hear they in the court-yard,<br> On the highway hear the sledges,<br> To the court comes Ilmarinen,<br> With his body-guard of heroes;<br> In the midst the chosen suitor,<br> Not too far in front of others,<br> Not too far behind his fellows.<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Hie ye hither, men and heroes,<br> Haste, ye watchers, to the stables,<br> There unhitch the suitor's stallion,<br> Lower well the racer's breast-plate,<br> There undo the straps and buckles,<br> Loosen well the shafts and traces,<br> And conduct the suitor hither,<br> Give my son-in-law good welcome!"</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen turned his racer<br> Into Louhi's yard and stables,<br> And descended from his snow-sledge.<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Come, thou servant of my bidding,<br> Best of all my trusted servants,<br> Take at once the bridegroom's courser<br> From the shafts adorned with silver,<br> From the curving arch of willow,<br> Lift the harness trimmed in copper,<br> Tie the white-face to the manger,<br> Treat the suitor's steed with kindness,<br> Lead him carefully to shelter<br> By his soft and shining bridle,<br> By his halter tipped with silver;<br> Let him roll among the sand-hills,<br> On the bottoms soft and even,<br> On the borders of the snow-banks,<br> In the fields of milky color.</p> 
<p>"Lead the hero's steed to water,<br> Lead him to the Pohya-fountains,<br> Where the living streams are flowing,<br> Sweet as milk of human kindness,<br> From the roots of silvery birches,<br> Underneath the shade of aspens.</p> 
<p>"Feed the courser of the suitor,<br> On the sweetest corn and barley,<br> On the summer-wheat and clover,<br> In the caldron steeped in sweetness;<br> Feed him at the golden manger,<br> In the boxes lined with copper,<br> At my manger richly furnished,<br> In the warmest of the stables;<br> Tie him with a silk-like halter,<br> To the golden rings and staples,<br> To the hooks of purest silver,<br> Set in beams of birch and oak-wood;<br> Feed him on the hay the sweetest,<br> Feed him on the corn nutritious,<br> Give the best my barns can furnish.</p> 
<p>"Curry well the suitor's courser<br> With the curry-comb of fish-bone,<br> Brush his hair with silken brushes,<br> Put his mane and tail in order,<br> Cover well with flannel blankets,<br> Blankets wrought in gold and silver,<br> Buckles forged from shining copper.</p> 
<p>"Come, ye small lads of the village,<br> Lead the suitor to my chambers,<br> With your auburn locks uncovered,<br> From your hands remove your mittens,<br> See if ye can lead the hero<br> Through the door without his stooping,<br> Lifting not the upper cross-bar,<br> Lowering not the oaken threshold,<br> Moving not the birchen casings,<br> Great the hero who must enter.</p> 
<p>"Ilmarinen is too stately,<br> Cannot enter through the portals,<br> Not the son-in-law and bridegroom,<br> Till the portals have been heightened;<br> Taller by a head the suitor<br> Than the door-ways of the mansion."</p> 
<p>Quick the servants of Pohyola<br> Tore away the upper cross-bar,<br> That his cap might not be lifted;<br> Made the oaken threshold lower<br> That the hero might not stumble;<br> Made the birch-wood portals wider,<br> Opened full the door of welcome,<br> Easy entrance for the suitor.</p> 
<p>Speaks the hostess of the Northland<br> As the bridegroom freely passes<br> Through the doorway of her dwelling:<br> "Thanks are due to thee, O Ukko,<br> That my son-in-law has entered!<br> Let me now my halls examine;<br> Make the bridal chambers ready,<br> Finest linen on my tables,<br> Softest furs upon my benches,<br> Birchen flooring scrubbed to whiteness,<br> All my rooms in perfect order."</p> 
<p>Then the hostess of Pohyola<br> Visited her spacious dwelling,<br> Did not recognize her chambers;<br> Every room had been remodeled,<br> Changed by force of mighty magic;<br> All the halls were newly burnished,<br> Hedge-hog bones were used for ceilings,<br> Bones of reindeer for foundations,<br> Bones of wolverine for door-sills,<br> For the cross-bars bones of roebuck,<br> Apple-wood were all the rafters,<br> Alder-wood, the window-casings,<br> Scales of trout adorned the windows,<br> And the fires were set in flowers.<br> All the seats were made of silver,<br> All the floors of copper-tiling,<br> Gold-adorned were all the tables,<br> On the floor were silken mattings,<br> Every fire-place set in copper,<br> Every hearth-stone cut from marble,<br> On each shelf were colored sea-shells,<br> Kalew's tree was their protection.</p> 
<p>To the court-room came the hero,<br> Chosen suitor from Wainola,<br> These the words of Ilmarinen:<br> "Send, O Ukko, health and pleasure<br> To this ancient home and dwelling,<br> To this mansion richly fashioned!"<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Let thy coming be auspicious<br> To these halls of thee unworthy,<br> To the home of thine affianced,<br> To this dwelling lowly fashioned,<br> Mid the lindens and the aspens.</p> 
<p>"Come, ye maidens that should serve me,<br> Come, ye fellows from the village,<br> Bring me fire upon the birch-bark,<br> Light the fagots of the fir-tree,<br> That I may behold the bridegroom,<br> Chosen suitor of my daughter,<br> Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> See the color of his eyeballs,<br> Whether they are blue or sable,<br> See if they are warm and faithful."</p> 
<p>Quick the young lads from the village<br> Brought the fire upon the birch-bark,<br> Brought it on the tips of pine-wood;<br> And the fire and smoke commingled<br> Roll and roar about the hero,<br> Blackening the suitor's visage,<br> And the hostess speaks as follows;<br> "Bring the fire upon a taper,<br> On the waxen tapers bring it!"</p> 
<p>Then the maidens did as bidden,<br> Quickly brought the lighted tapers,<br> Made the suitor's eyeballs glisten,<br> Made his cheeks look fresh and ruddy;<br> Made his eyes of sable color<br> Sparkle like the foam of waters,<br> Like the reed-grass on the margin,<br> Colored as the ocean jewels,<br> Iridescent as the rainbow.</p> 
<p>"Come, ye fellows of the hamlet,<br> Lead my son-in-law and hero<br> To the highest seat at table,<br> To the seat of greatest honor,<br> With his back upon the blue-wall,<br> Looking on my bounteous tables,<br> Facing all the guests of Northland."</p> 
<p>Then the hostess of Pohyola<br> Served her guests in great abundance,<br> Richest drinks and rarest viands,<br> First of all she, served the bridegroom<br> On his platters, honeyed biscuit,<br> And the sweetest river salmon,<br> Seasoned butter, roasted bacon,<br> All the dainties of Pohyola.<br> Then the helpers served the others,<br> Filled the plates of all invited<br> With the varied food of Northland.<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Come, ye maidens from the village,<br> Hither bring the beer in pitchers,<br> In the urns with double handles,<br> To the many guests in-gathered,<br> Ere all others, serve the bridegroom."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the merry maidens<br> Brought the beer in silver pitchers<br> From the copper-banded vessels,<br> For the wedding-guests assembled;<br> And the beer, fermenting, sparkled<br> On the beard of Ilmarinen,<br> On the beards of many heroes.</p> 
<p>When the guests had all partaken<br> Of the wondrous beer of barley,<br> Spake the beer in merry accents<br> Through the tongues of the magicians,<br> Through the tongue of many a hero,<br> Through the tongue of Wainamoinen,<br> Famed to be the sweetest singer<br> Of the Northland bards and minstrels,<br> These the words of the enchanter:<br> "O thou beer of honeyed flavor,<br> Let us not imbibe in silence,<br> Let some hero sing thy praises,<br> Sing thy worth in golden measures;<br> Let the hostess start the singing,<br> Let the bridegroom sound thy virtues!<br> Have our songs thus quickly vanished,<br> Have our joyful tongues grown silent?<br> Evil then has been the brewing,<br> Then the beer must be unworthy,<br> That it does not cheer the singer,<br> Does not move the merry minstrel,<br> That the golden guests are joyless,<br> And the cuckoo is not singing.<br> Never will these benches echo<br> Till the bench-guests chant thy virtues;<br> Nor the floor resound thy praises<br> Till the floor-guests sing in concord;<br> Nor the windows join the chorus<br> Till the window-guests have spoken;<br> All the tables will keep silence<br> Till the heroes toast thy virtues;<br> Little singing from the chimney<br> Till the chimney-guests have chanted."</p> 
<p>On the floor a child was sitting,<br> Thus the little boy made answer:<br> "I am small and young in singing,<br> Have perchance but little wisdom;<br> Be that as it may, my seniors,<br> Since the elder minstrels sing not,<br> Nor the heroes chant their legends,<br> Nor the hostess lead the singing,<br> I will sing my simple stories,<br> Sing my little store of knowledge,<br> To the pleasure of the evening,<br> To the joy of the invited."</p> 
<p>Near the fire reclined an old man,<br> And the gray-beard thus made answer:<br> "Not the time for children's singing,<br> Children's wisdom is too ready,<br> Children's songs are filled with trifles,<br> Filled with shrewd and vain deceptions,<br> Maiden-songs are full of follies;<br> Leave the songs and incantations<br> To the ancient wizard-singers;<br> Leave the tales of times primeval<br> To the minstrel of Wainola,<br> To the hero of the Northland,<br> To the, ancient Wainamoinen."<br> Thereupon Osmoinen answered:<br> "Are there not some sweeter singers<br> In this honored congregation,<br> That will clasp their hands together,<br> Sing the ancient songs unbroken,<br> Thus begin the incantations,<br> Make these ancient halls re-echo<br> For the pleasure of the evening,<br> For the joy of the in-gathered?"<br> From the hearth-stone spake, the gray-beard<br> "Not a singer of Pohyola,<br> Not a minstrel, nor magician,<br> That was better skilled in chanting<br> Legends of the days departed,<br> Than was I when I was singing,<br> In my years of vain ambition;<br> Then I chanted tales of heroes,<br> On the blue back of the waters,<br> Sang the ballads of my people,<br> In the vales and on the mountains,<br> Through the verdant fields and forests;<br> Sweet my voice and skilled my singing,<br> All my songs were highly lauded,<br> Rippled like the quiet rivers,<br> Easy-flowing like the waters,<br> Easy-gliding as the snow-shoes,<br> Like the ship upon the ocean.</p> 
<p>"Woe is me, my days are ended,<br> Would not recognize my singing,<br> All its sweetness gone to others,<br> Flows no more like rippling waters,<br> Makes no more the hills re-echo!<br> Now my songs are full of discord,<br> Like the rake upon the stubble,<br> Like the sledge upon the gravel,<br> Like the boat upon the sea-shore!"</p> 
<p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Spake these words in magic measures:<br> "Since no other bard appeareth<br> That will clasp my hand in singing,<br> I will sing some simple legends,<br> Sing my, garnered store of wisdom,<br> Make these magic halls re-echo<br> With my tales of ancient story,<br> Since a bard I was created,<br> Born an orator and singer;<br> Do not ask the ways of others,<br> Follow not the paths of strangers."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, famous minstrel,<br> Song's eternal, wise supporter,<br> Then began the songs of pleasure,<br> Made the halls resound with joyance,<br> Filled the rooms with wondrous singing;<br> Sang the ancient bard-magician<br> All the oldest wisdom-sayings,<br> Did not fail in voice nor legends,<br> All the wisest thoughts remembered.</p> 
<p>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Sang the joy of all assembled,<br> To the pleasure of the evening,<br> To the merriment of maidens,<br> To the happiness of heroes;<br> All the guests were stilled in wonder<br> At the magic of his singing,<br> At the songs of the magician.</p> 
<p>Spake again wise Wainamoinen,<br> When his wonder-tales had ended:<br> "l have little worth or power,<br> Am a bard of little value,<br> Little consequence my singing,<br> Mine abilities as nothing,<br> If but Ukko, my Creator,<br> Should intone his wisdom-sayings,<br> Sing the source of good and evil,<br> Sing the origin of matter,<br> Sing the legends of omniscience,<br> Sing his songs in full perfection.<br> God could sing the floods to honey,<br> Sing the sands to ruddy berries,<br> Sing the pebbles into barley,<br> Sing to beer the running waters,<br> Sing to salt the rocks of ocean,<br> Into corn-fields sing the forests,<br> Into gold the forest-fruitage,<br> Sing to bread the hills and mountains,<br> Sing to eggs the rounded sandstones;<br> He could touch the springs of magic,<br> He could turn the keys of nature,<br> And produce within thy pastures,<br> Hurdles filled with sheep and reindeer,<br> Stables filled with fleet-foot stallions,<br> Kine in every field and fallow;<br> Sing a fur-robe for the bridegroom,<br> For the bride a coat of ermine,<br> For the hostess, shoes of silver,<br> For the hero, mail of copper.</p> 
<p>"Grant O Ukko, my Creator,<br> God of love, and truth, and justice,<br> Grant thy blessing on our feasting,<br> Bless this company assembled,<br> For the good of Sariola,<br> For the happiness of Northland!<br> May this bread and beer bring joyance,<br> May they come in rich abundance,<br> May they carry full contentment<br> To the people of Pohyola,<br> To the cabin and the mansion;<br> May the hours we spend in singing,<br> In the morning, in the evening,<br> Fill our hearts with joy and gladness!<br> Hear us in our supplications,<br> Grant to us thy needed blessings,<br> Send enjoyment, health, and comfort,<br> To the people here assembled,<br> To the host and to the hostess,<br> To the bride and to the bridegroom,<br> To the sons upon the waters,<br> To the daughters at their weavings,<br> To the hunters on the mountains,<br> To the shepherds in the fenlands,<br> That our lives may end in honor,<br> That we may recall with pleasure<br> Ilmarinen's magic marriage<br> To the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Snow-white virgin of the Northland."</p>
