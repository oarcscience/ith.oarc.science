<p>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<br> Touched again his magic harp-strings,<br> Sang in miracles of concord,<br> Filled the north with joy and gladness.<br> Melodies arose to heaven,<br> Songs arose to Luna's chambers,<br> Echoed through the Sun's bright windows<br> And the Moon has left her station,<br> Drops and settles in the birch-tree;<br> And the Sun comes from his castle,<br> Settles in the fir-tree branches,<br> Comes to share the common pleasure,<br> Comes to listen to the singing,<br> To the harp of Wainamoinen.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Northland's old and toothless wizard,<br> Makes the Sun and Moon her captives;<br> In her arms she takes fair Luna<br> From her cradle in the birch-tree,<br> Calls the Sun down from his station,<br> From the fir-tree's bending branches,<br> Carries them to upper Northland,<br> To the darksome Sariola;<br> Hides the Moon, no more to glimmer,<br> In a rock of many colors;<br> Hides the Sun, to shine no longer,<br> In the iron-banded mountain;<br> Thereupon these words she utters:<br> "Moon of gold and Sun of silver,<br> Hide your faces in the caverns<br> Of Pohyola's dismal mountain;<br> Shine no more to gladden Northland,<br> Till I come to give ye freedom,<br> Drawn by coursers nine in number,<br> Sable coursers of one mother!"</p> 
<p>When the golden Moon had vanished,<br> And the silver Sun had hidden<br> In the iron-banded caverns,<br> Louhi stole the fire from Northland,<br> From the regions of Wainola,<br> Left the mansions cold and cheerless,<br> And the cabins full of darkness.<br> Night was king and reigned unbroken,<br> Darkness ruled in Kalevala,<br> Darkness in the home of Ukko.<br> Hard to live without the moonlight,<br> Harder still without the sunshine;<br> Ukko's life is dark and dismal,<br> When the Sun and Moon desert him.</p> 
<p>Ukko, first of all creators,<br> Lived in wonder at the darkness;<br> Long reflected, well considered,<br> Why this miracle in heaven,<br> What this accident in nature<br> To the Moon upon her journey;<br> Why the Sun no more is shining,<br> Why has disappeared the moonlight.<br> Then great Ukko walked the heavens,<br> To the border of the cloudlets,<br> In his purple-colored vestments,<br> In his silver-tinselled sandals,<br> Seeking for the golden moonlight,<br> Looking for the silver sunshine.<br> Lightning Ukko struck in darkness<br> From the edges of his fire-sword;<br> Shot the flames in all directions,<br> From his blade of golden color,<br> Into heaven's upper spaces,<br> Into Ether's starry pastures.</p> 
<p>When a little fire had kindled,<br> Ukko hid it in the cloud-space,<br> In a box of gold and silver,<br> In a case adorned with silver,<br> Gave it to the ether-maidens,<br> Called a virgin then to rock it,<br> That it might become a new-moon,<br> That a second sun might follow.<br> On the long-cloud rocked the virgin,<br> On the blue-edge of the ether,<br> Rocked the fire of the Creator,<br> In her copper-colored cradle,<br> With her ribbons silver-studded.<br> Lowly bend the bands of silver,<br> Loud the golden cradle echoes,<br> And the clouds of Northland thunder,<br> Low descends the dome of heaven,<br> At the rocking of the lightning,<br> Rocking of the fire of Ukko.<br> Thus the flame was gently cradled<br> By the virgin of the ether.<br> Long the fair and faithful maiden<br> Stroked the Fire-child with her fingers,<br> Tended it with care and pleasure,<br> Till in an unguarded moment<br> It escaped the Ether-virgin,<br> Slipped the hands of her that nursed it.<br> Quick the heavens are burst asunder,<br> Quick the vault of Ukko opens,<br> Downward drops the wayward Fire-child,<br> Downward quick the red-ball rushes,<br> Shoots across the arch of heaven,<br> Hisses through the startled cloudlets,<br> Flashes through the troubled welkin,<br> Through nine starry vaults of ether.</p> 
<p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Spake and these the words he uttered:<br> "Blacksmith brother, Ilmarinen,<br> Let us haste and look together,<br> What the kind of fire that falleth,<br> What the form of light that shineth<br> From the upper vault of heaven,<br> From the lower earth and ocean.<br> Has a second moon arisen,<br> Can it be a ball of sunlight?</p> 
<p>Thereupon the heroes wandered,<br> Onward journeyed and reflected,<br> How to gain the spot illumined,<br> How to find the sacred Fire-child.<br> Came a river rushing by them,<br> Broad and stately as an ocean.<br> Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> There began to build a vessel,<br> Build a boat to cross the river.<br> With the aid of Ilmarinen,<br> From the oak he cut the row-locks,<br> From the pine the oars be fashioned,<br> From the aspen shapes the rudder.<br> When the vessel they had finished,<br> Quick they rolled it to the current,<br> Hard they rowed and ever forward,<br> On the Nawa-stream and waters,<br> At the head of Nawa-river.</p> 
<p>Ilmatar, the ether-daughter,<br> Foremost daughter of creation,<br> Came to meet them on their journey,<br> Thus addressed the coming strangers:<br> "Who are ye of Northland heroes,<br> Rowing on the Nawa-waters?"<br> Wainamoinen gave this answer:<br> "This the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> I the ancient Wainamoinen.<br> Tell us now thy name and station,<br> Whither going, whence thou comest,<br> Where thy tribe-folk live and linger?<br> Spake the daughter of the Ether:<br> "I the oldest of the women,<br> Am the first of Ether's daughters,<br> Am the first of ancient mothers;<br> Seven times have I been wedded.<br> To the heroes of creation.<br> Whither do ye strangers journey?<br> Answered thus old Wainamoinen:<br> "Fire has left Wainola's hearth-stones,<br> Light has disappeared from Northland;<br> Have been sitting long in darkness,<br> Cold and darkness our companions;<br> Now we journey to discover<br> What the fire that fell from heaven,<br> Falling from the cloud's red lining,<br> To the deeps of earth and ocean."<br> Ilmatar returned this answer:<br> "Hard the flame is to discover,<br> Hard indeed to find the Fire-child;<br> Has committed many mischiefs,<br> Nothing good has he accomplished;<br> Quick the fire-ball fell from ether,<br> From the red rims of the cloudlets,<br> From the plains of the Creator,<br> Through the ever-moving heavens,<br> Through the purple ether-spaces,<br> Through the blackened flues of Turi,<br> To Palwoinen's rooms uncovered.<br> When the fire had reached the chambers<br> Of Palwoinen, son of evil,<br> He began his wicked workings,<br> He engaged in lawless actions,<br> Raged against the blushing maidens,<br> Fired the youth to evil conduct,<br> Singed the beards of men and heroes.</p> 
<p>"Where the mother nursed her baby,<br> In the cold and cheerless cradle,<br> Thither flew the wicked Fire-child,<br> There to perpetrate some mischief;<br> In the cradle burned the infant,<br> By the infant burned the mother,<br> That the babe might visit Mana,<br> In the kingdom of Tuoni;<br> Said the child was born for dying,<br> Only destined for destruction,<br> Through the tortures of the Fire-child.<br> Greater knowledge had the mother,<br> Did not journey to Manala,<br> Knew the word to check the red-flame,<br> How to banish the intruder<br> Through the eyelet of a needle,<br> Through the death-hole of the hatchet."</p> 
<p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Questioned Ilmatar as follows:<br> "Whither did the Fire-child wander,<br> Whither did the red-flame hasten,<br> From the border-fields of Turi,<br> To the woods, or to the waters?<br> Straightway Ilmatar thus answers:<br> "When the fire had fled from Turi,<br> From the castles of Palwoinen,<br> Through the eyelet of the needle,<br> Through the death-hole of the hatchet,<br> First it burned the fields, and forests,<br> Burned the lowlands, and the heather;<br> Then it sought the mighty waters,<br> Sought the Alue-sea and river,<br> And the waters hissed and sputtered<br> In their anger at the Fire-child,<br> Fiery red the boiling Alue!</p> 
<p>"Three times in the nights of, summer,<br> Nine times in the nights of autumn,<br> Boil the waters to the tree-tops,<br> Roll and tumble to the mountain,<br> Through the red-ball's force and fury;<br> Hurls the pike upon the pastures,<br> To the mountain-cliffs, the salmon,<br> Where the ocean-dwellers wonder,<br> Long reflect and well consider<br> How to still the angry waters.<br> Wept the salmon for his grotto,<br> Mourned the whiting for his cavern,<br> And the lake-trout for his dwelling,<br> Quick the crook-necked salmon darted,<br> Tried to catch the fire-intruder,<br> But the red-ball quick escaped him;<br> Darted then the daring whiting,<br> Swallowed quick the wicked Fire-child,<br> Swallowed quick the flame of evil.<br> Quiet grow the Alue-waters,<br> Slowly settle to their shore-lines,<br> To their long-accustomed places,<br> In the long and dismal evening.</p> 
<p>"Time had gone but little distance,<br> When the whiting grow affrighted,<br> Fear befel the fire-devourer;<br> Burning pain and writhing tortures<br> Seized the eater of the Fire-child;<br> Swam the fish in all directions,<br> Called, and moaned, and swam, and circled,<br> Swam one day, and then a second,<br> Swam the third from morn till even;<br> Swam she to the whiting-island,<br> To the caverns of the salmon,<br> Where a hundred islands cluster;<br> And the islands there assembled<br> Thus addressed the fire-devourer:<br> 'There is none within these waters,<br> In this narrow Alue-lakelet,<br> That will eat the fated Fire-fish<br> That will swallow thee in trouble,<br> In thine agonies and torture<br> From the Fire-child thou hast eaten.'</p> 
<p>"Hearing this a trout forth darting,<br> Swallowed quick as light the whiting,<br> Quickly ate the fire-devourer.<br> Time had gone but little distance,<br> When the trout became affrighted,<br> Fear befel the whiting-eater;<br> Burning pain and writhing torment<br> Seized the eater of the Fire-fish.<br> Swam the trout in all directions,<br> Called, and moaned, and swam, and circled,<br> Swam one day, and then a second,<br> Swain the third from morn till even;<br> Swam she to the salmon-island,<br> Swam she to the whiting-grottoes,<br> Where a thousand islands cluster,<br> And the islands there assembled<br> Thus addressed the tortured lake-trout:<br> 'There is none within this river,<br> In these narrow Alue-waters,<br> That will eat the wicked Fire-fish,<br> That will swallow thee in trouble,<br> In thine agonies and tortures,<br> From the Fire-fish thou hast eaten."</p> 
<p>Hearing this the gray-pike darted,<br> Swallowed quick as light the lake-trout,<br> Quickly ate the tortured Fire-fish.</p> 
<p>"Time had gone but little distance,<br> When the gray-pike grew affrighted,<br> Fear befel the lake-trout-eater;<br> Burning pain and writhing torment<br> Seized the reckless trout-devourer;<br> Swam the pike in all directions,<br> Called, and moaned, and swam, and circled,<br> Swam one day, and then a second,<br> Swam the third from morn till even,<br> To the cave of ocean-swallows,<br> To the sand-hills of the sea-gull,<br> Where a hundred islands cluster;<br> And the islands there assembled<br> Thus addressed the fire-devourer:<br> 'There is none within this lakelet,<br> In these narrow Alue-waters,<br> That will eat the fated Fire-fish,<br> That will swallow thee in trouble,<br> In thine agonies and tortures,<br> From the Fire-fish thou hast eaten.'"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<br> With the aid of Ilmarinen,<br> Weaves with skill a mighty fish-net<br> From the juniper and sea-grass;<br> Dyes the net with alder-water,<br> Ties it well with thongs of willow.<br> Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> Called the maidens to the fish-net,<br> And the sisters came as bidden.<br> With the netting rowed they onward,<br> Rowed they to the hundred islands,<br> To the grottoes of the salmon,<br> To the caverns of the whiting,<br> To the reeds of sable color,<br> Where the gray-pike rests and watches.<br> On they hasten to the fishing,<br> Drag the net in all directions,<br> Drag it lengthwise, sidewise, crosswise,<br> And diagonally zigzag;<br> But they did not catch the Fire-fish.</p> 
<p>Then the brothers went a-fishing,<br> Dragged the net in all directions,<br> Backwards, forwards, lengthwise, sidewise,<br> Through the homes of ocean-dwellers,<br> Through the grottoes of the salmon,<br> Through the dwellings of the whiting,<br> Through the reed-beds of the lake-trout,<br> Where the gray-pike lies in ambush;<br> But the fated Fire-fish came not,<br> Came not from the lake's abysses,<br> Came not from the Alue-waters.</p> 
<p>Little fish could not be captured<br> In the large nets of the masters;<br> Murmured then the deep-sea-dwellers,<br> Spake the salmon to the lake-trout,<br> And the lake-trout to the whiting,<br> And the whiting to the gray-pike:<br> Have the heroes of Wainola<br> Died, or have they all departed<br> From these fertile shores and waters?<br> Where then are the ancient weavers,<br> Weavers of the nets of flax-thread,<br> Those that frighten us with fish-poles,<br> Drag us from our homes unwilling?"</p> 
<p>Hearing this wise Wainamoinen<br> Answered thus the deep-sea-dwellers:<br> "Neither have Wainola's heroes<br> Died, nor have they all departed<br> From these fertile shores and waters,<br> Two are born where one has perished;<br> Longer poles and finer fish-nets<br> Have the sons of Kalevala!"</p>
