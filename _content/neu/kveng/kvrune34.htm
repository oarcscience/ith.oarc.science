<p>KULLERWOINEN, young magician,<br> In his beauteous, golden ringlets,<br> In his magic shoes of deer-skin,<br> Left the home of Ilmarinen<br> Wandered forth upon his journey,<br> Ere the blacksmith heard the tidings<br> Of the cruel death and torture<br> Of his wife and joy-companion,<br> Lest a bloody fight should follow.</p> 
<p>Kullerwoinen left the smithy,<br> Blowing on his magic bugle,<br> Joyful left the lands of Ilma,<br> Blowing blithely on the heather,<br> Made the distant hills re-echo,<br> Made the swamps and mountains tremble,<br> Made the heather-blossoms answer<br> To the music of his cow-horn,<br> In its wild reverberations,<br> To the magic of his playing.<br> Songs were heard within the smithy,<br> And the blacksmith stopped and listened,<br> Hastened to the door and window,<br> Hastened to the open court-yard,<br> If perchance he might discover<br> What was playing on the heather,<br> What was sounding through the forest.<br> Quick he learned the cruel story,<br> Learned the cause of the rejoicing,<br> Saw the hostess dead before him,<br> Knew his beauteous wife had perished,<br> Saw the lifeless form extended,<br> In the court-yard of his dwelling.<br> Thereupon the metal-artist<br> Fell to bitter tears and wailings,<br> Wept through all the dreary night-time,<br> Deep the grief that settled o'er him,<br> Black as night his darkened future,<br> Could not stay his tears of sorrow.</p> 
<p>Kullerwoinen hastened onward,<br> Straying, roaming, hither, thither,<br> Wandered on through field and forest,<br> O'er the Hisi-plains and woodlands.<br> When the darkness settled o'er him,<br> When the bird of night was flitting,<br> Sat the fatherless at evening,<br> The forsaken sat and rested<br> On a hillock of the forest.<br> Thus he murmured, heavy-hearted:<br> "Why was I, alas! created,<br> Why was I so ill-begotten,<br> Since for months and years I wander,<br> Lost among the ether-spaces?<br> Others have their homes to dwell in,<br> Others hasten to their firesides<br> As the evening gathers round them:<br> But my home is in the forest,<br> And my bed upon the heather,<br> And my bath-room is the rain-cloud.</p> 
<p>"Never didst thou, God of mercy,<br> Never in the course of ages,<br> Give an infant birth unwisely;<br> Wherefore then was I created,<br> Fatherless to roam in ether,<br> Motherless and lone to wander?<br> Thou, O Ukko, art my father,<br> Thou hast given me form and feature;<br> As the sea-gull on the ocean,<br> As the duck upon the waters,<br> Shines the Sun upon the swallow,<br> Shines as bright upon the sparrow,<br> Gives the joy-birds song and gladness,<br> Does not shine on me unhappy;<br> Nevermore will shine the sunlight,<br> Never will the moonlight glimmer<br> On this hapless son and orphan;<br> Do not know my hero-father,<br> Cannot tell who was my mother;<br> On the shore, perhaps the gray-duck<br> Left me in the sand to perish.<br> Young was I and small of stature,<br> When my mother left me orphaned;<br> Dead, my father and my mother,<br> Dead, my honored tribe of heroes;<br> Shoes they left me that are icy,<br> Stockings filled with frosts of ages,<br> Let me on the freezing ice-plains<br> Fall to perish in the rushes;<br> From the giddy heights of mountains<br> Let me tumble to destruction.</p> 
<p>"O, thou wise and good Creator,<br> Why my birth and what my service?<br> I shall never fall and perish<br> On the ice-plains, in the marshes,<br> Never be a bridge in swamp-land,<br> Not while I have arms of virtue<br> That can serve my honored kindred!"</p> 
<p>Then Kullervo thought to journey<br> To the village of Untamo,<br> To avenge his father's murder,<br> To avenge his mother's tortures,<br> And the troubles of his tribe-folk.<br> These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br> "Wait, yea wait, thou Untamoinen,<br> Thou destroyer of my people;<br> When I meet thee in the combat,<br> I will slay thee and thy kindred,<br> I will burn thy homes to ashes!"</p> 
<p>Came a woman on the highway,<br> Dressed in blue, the aged mother,<br> To Kullervo spake as follows:<br> "Whither goest, Kullerwoinen,<br> Whither hastes the wayward hero?<br> Kullerwoinen gave this answer:<br> "I have thought that I would journey<br> To the far-off land of strangers,<br> To the village of Untamo,<br> To avenge my father's murder,<br> To avenge my mother's tortures,<br> And the troubles of my tribe-folk."<br> Thus the gray-haired woman answered:<br> "Surely thou dost rest in error,<br> For thy tribe has never perished,<br> And thy mother still is living<br> With thy father in the Northland,<br> Living with the old Kalervo."</p> 
<p>"O, thou ancient dame beloved,<br> Worthy mother of the woodlands,<br> Tell me where my father liveth,<br> Where my loving mother lingers!"</p> 
<p>"Yonder lives thine aged father,<br> And thy loving mother with him,<br> On the farthest shore of Northland,<br> On the long-point of the fish-lake!"</p> 
<p>"Tell me, O thou woodland-mother,<br> How to journey to my people,<br> How to find mine honored tribe-folk."</p> 
<p>"Easy is the way for strangers:<br> Thou must journey through the forest,<br> Hasten to the river-border,<br> Travel one day, then a second,<br> And the third from morn till even,<br> To the north-west, thou must journey.<br> If a mountain comes to meet thee,<br> Go around the nearing mountain,<br> Westward bold thy weary journey,<br> Till thou comest to a river,<br> On thy right hand flowing eastward;<br> Travel to the river border,<br> Where three water-falls will greet thee;<br> When thou comest to a headland,<br> On the point thou'lt see a cottage<br> Where the fishermen assemble;<br> In this cottage is thy father,<br> With thy mother and her daughters,<br> Beautiful thy maiden sisters."</p> 
<p>Kullerwoinen, the magician,<br> Hastens northward on his journey,<br> Walks one day, and then a second,<br> Walks the third from morn till evening;<br> To the north-west walks Kullervo,<br> Till a mountain comes to meet him,<br> Walks around the nearing mountain;<br> Westward, westward, holds his journey,<br> Till he sees a river coming;<br> Hastens to the river border,<br> Walks along the streams and rapids<br> Till three waterfalls accost him;<br> Travels till he meets a headland,<br> On the point he spies a cottage,<br> Where the fishermen assemble.</p> 
<p>Quick he journeys to the cabin,<br> Quick he passes through the portals<br> Of the cottage on the headland,<br> Where he finds his long-lost kindred;<br> No one knows the youth, Kullervo,<br> No one knows whence comes the stranger,<br> Where his home, nor where he goeth.<br> These the words of young Kullervo:<br> "Dost thou know me not, my mother,<br> Dost thou know me not, my father?<br> I am hapless Kullerwoinen<br> Whom the heroes of Untamo<br> Carried to their distant country,<br> When my height was but a hand-breadth."<br> Quick the hopeful mother answers:<br> "O my worthy son, beloved,<br> O my precious silver-buckle,<br> Hast thou with thy mind of magic,<br> Wandered through the fields of Northland<br> Searching for thy home and kindred?<br> As one dead I long have mourned thee,<br> Had supposed thee, in Manala.<br> Once I had two sons and heroes,<br> Had two good and beauteous daughters,<br> Two of these have long been absent,<br> Elder son and elder daughter;<br> For the wars my son departed,<br> While my daughter strayed and perished<br> If my son is home returning,<br> Yet my daughter still is absent,<br> Kullerwoinen asked his mother:<br> "Whither did my sister wander,<br> What direction did she journey ?<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "This the story of thy sister:<br> Went for berries to the woodlands,<br> To the mountains went my daughter,<br> Where the lovely maiden vanished,<br> Where my pretty berry perished,<br> Died some death beyond my knowledge,<br> Nameless is the death she suffered.<br> Who is mourning for the daughter?<br> No one mourns her as her mother,<br> Walks and wanders, Mourns and searches,<br> For her fairest child and daughter;<br> Therefore did the mother wander,<br> Searching for thy lovely sister,<br> Like the bear she roamed the forest,<br> Ran the glenways like the adder,<br> Searched one day and then a second,<br> Searched the third from morn till even,<br> Till she reached the mountain-summit,<br> There she called and called her daughter,<br> Till the distant mountains answered,<br> Called to her who had departed:<br> I Where art thou, my lovely maiden,<br> Come my daughter to thy mother!'</p> 
<p>"Thus I called, and sought thy sister,<br> This the answer of the mountains,<br> Thus the hills and valleys echoed:<br> 'Call no more, thou weeping mother,<br> Weep no more for the departed;<br> Nevermore in all thy lifetime,<br> Never in the course of ages,<br> Will she join again her kindred,<br> At her brother's landing-places,<br> In her father's humble dwelling.'"</p>
