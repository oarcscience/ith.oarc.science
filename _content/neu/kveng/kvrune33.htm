<p>THEREUPON the lad, Kullervo,<br> Laid his luncheon in his basket,<br> Drove the herd to mountain-pastures,<br> O'er the hills and through the marshes,<br> To their grazings in the woodlands,<br> Speaking as he careless wandered:<br> "Of the youth am I the poorest,<br> Hapless lad and full of trouble,<br> Evil luck to me befallen!<br> I alas! must idly wander<br> O'er the hills and through the valleys,<br> As a watch-dog for the cattle!"</p> 
<p>Then she sat upon the greensward,<br> In a sunny spot selected,<br> Singing, chanting words as follow:<br> "Shine, O shine, thou Sun of heaven,<br> Cast thy rays, thou fire of Ukko,<br> On the herdsman of the blacksmith,<br> On the head of Kullerwoinen,<br> On this poor and luckless shepherd,<br> Not in Ilmarinen's smithy,<br> Nor the dwellings of his people;<br> Good the table of the hostess,<br> Cuts the best of wheaten biscuit,<br> Honey-cakes she cuts in slices,<br> Spreading each with golden butter;<br> Only dry bread has the herdsman,<br> Eats with pain the oaten bread-crusts,'<br> Filled with chaff his and biscuit,<br> Feeds upon the worst of straw-bread,<br> Pine-tree bark, the broad he feeds on,<br> Sipping water from the birch-bark,<br> Drinking from the tips of grasses I<br> Go, O Sun, and go, O barley,<br> Haste away, thou light of Ukko,<br> Hide within the mountain pine-trees,<br> Go, O wheat, to yonder thickets,<br> To the trees of purple berries,<br> To the junipers and alders,<br> Safely lead the herdsman homeward<br> To the biscuit golden-buttered,<br> To the honeyed cakes and viands!"</p> 
<p>While the shepherd lad was singing<br> Kullerwoinen's song and echo,<br> Ilmarinen's wife was feasting<br> On the sweetest bread of Northland,<br> On the toothsome cakes of barley,<br> On the richest of provisions;<br> Only laid aside some cabbage,<br> For the herdsman, Kullerwoinen;<br> Set apart some wasted fragments,<br> Leavings of the dogs at dinner,<br> For the shepherd, home returning.</p> 
<p>From the woods a bird came flying,<br> Sang this song to Kullerwoinen:<br> "'Tis the time for forest-dinners,<br> For the fatherless companion<br> Of the herds to eat his viands,<br> Eat the good things from his basket!"</p> 
<p>Kullerwoinen heard the songster,<br> Looked upon the Sun's long shadow,<br> Straightway spake the words that follow:<br> "True, the singing of the song-bird,<br> It is time indeed for feasting,<br> Time to eat my basket-dinner."</p> 
<p>Thereupon young Kullerwoinen<br> Called his herd to rest in safety,<br> Sat upon a grassy hillock,<br> Took his basket from his shoulders,<br> Took therefrom the and oat-loaf,<br> Turned it over in his fingers,<br> Carefully the loaf inspected,<br> Spake these words of ancient wisdom:<br> "Many loaves are fine to look on,<br> On the outside seem delicious,<br> On the inside, chaff and tan-bark!"</p> 
<p>Then the shepherd, Kullerwoinen,<br> Drew his knife to cut his oat-loaf,<br> Cut the hard and arid biscuit;<br> Cuts against a stone imprisoned,<br> Well imbedded in the centre,<br> Breaks his ancient knife in pieces;<br> When the shepherd youth, Kullervo,<br> Saw his magic knife had broken,<br> Weeping sore, he spake as follows:<br> "This, the blade that I bold sacred,<br> This the one thing that I honor,<br> Relic of my mother's people!<br> On the stone within this oat-loaf,<br> On this cheat-cake of the hostess,<br> I my precious knife have broken.<br> How shall I repay this insult,<br> How avenge this woman's malice,<br> What the wages for deception?"<br> From a tree the raven answered:<br> "O thou little silver buckle,<br> Only son of old Kalervo,<br> Why art thou in evil humor,<br> Wherefore sad in thy demeanor?<br> Take a young shoot from the thicket,<br> Take a birch-rod from the valley,<br> Drive thy herd across the lowlands,<br> Through the quicksands of the marshes;<br> To the wolves let one half wander,<br> To the bear-dens, lead the other;<br> Sing the forest wolves together,<br> Sing the bears down from the mountains,<br> Call the wolves thy little children,<br> And the bears thy standard-bearers;<br> Drive them like a cow-herd homeward,<br> Drive them home like spotted cattle,<br> Drive them to thy master's milk-yards;<br> Thus thou wilt repay the hostess<br> For her malice and derision."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the wizard answered,<br> These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br> "Wait, yea wait, thou bride of Hisi!<br> Do I mourn my mother's relic,<br> Mourn the keep-sake thou hast broken?<br> Thou thyself shalt mourn as sorely<br> When thy, cows come home at evening!"</p> 
<p>From the tree he cuts a birch-wand,<br> From the juniper a whip-stick,<br> Drives the herd across the lowlands,<br> Through the quicksands of the marshes,<br> To the wolves lets one half wander,<br> To the bear-dens leads the other;<br> Calls the wolves his little children,<br> Calls the bears his standard-bearers,<br> Changes all his herd of cattle<br> Into wolves and bears by magic.</p> 
<p>In the west the Sun is shining,<br> Telling that the night is coming.<br> Quick the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<br> Wanders o'er the pine-tree mountain,<br> Hastens through the forest homeward,<br> Drives the wolves and bears before him<br> Toward the milk-yards of the hostess;<br> To the herd he speaks as follows,<br> As they journey on together:<br> "Tear and kill the wicked hostess,<br> Tear her guilty flesh in pieces,<br> When she comes to view her cattle,<br> When she stoops to do her milking!"</p> 
<p>Then the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<br> From an ox-bone makes a bugle,<br> Makes it from Tuonikki's cow-horn,<br> Makes a flute from Kiryo's shin-bone,<br> Plays a song upon his bugle,<br> Plays upon his flute of magic,<br> Thrice upon the home-land hill-tops,<br> Six times near the coming gate-ways.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen's wife and hostess<br> Long had waited for the coming<br> Of her herd with Kullerwoinen,<br> Waited for the milk at evening,<br> Waited for the new-made butter,<br> Heard the footsteps in the cow-path,<br> On the heath she beard the bustle,<br> Spake these joyous words of welcome:<br> "Be thou praised, O gracious Ukko,<br> That my herd is home returning!<br> But I hear a bugle sounding,<br> 'Tis the playing of my herdsman,<br> Playing on a magic cow-horn,<br> Bursting all our ears with music!"</p> 
<p>Kullerwoinen, drawing nearer,<br> To the hostess spake as follows:<br> "Found the bugle in the woodlands,<br> And the flute among the rushes;<br> All thy herd are in the passage,<br> All thy cows within the hurdles,<br> This the time to build the camp-fire,<br> This the time to do the milking!"</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen's wife, the hostess,<br> Thus addressed an aged servant:<br> "Go, thou old one, to the milking,<br> Have the care of all my cattle,<br> Do not ask for mine assistance,<br> Since I have to knead the biscuit."<br> Kullerwoinen spake as follows:<br> "Always does the worthy hostess,<br> Ever does the wisdom-mother<br> Go herself and do the milking,<br> Tend the cows within the hurdles!"</p> 
<p>Then the wife of Ilmarinen<br> Built a field-fire in the passage,<br> Went to milk her cows awaiting,<br> Looked upon her herd in wonder,<br> Spake these happy words of greeting:<br> "Beautiful, my herd of cattle,<br> Glistening like the skins of lynxes,<br> Hair as soft as fur of ermine,<br> Peaceful waiting for the milk-pail!"</p> 
<p>On the milk-stool sits the hostess,<br> Milks one moment, then a second,<br> Then a third time milks and ceases;<br> When the bloody wolves disguising,<br> Quick attack the hostess milking,<br> And the bears lend their assistance,<br> Tear and mutilate her body<br> With their teeth and sharpened fingers.<br> Kullerwoinen, cruel wizard,<br> Thus repaid the wicked hostess,<br> Thus repaid her evil treatment.</p> 
<p>Quick the wife of Ilmarinen<br> Cried aloud in bitter anguish,<br> Thus addressed the youth, Kullervo:<br> "Evil son, thou bloody herdsman,<br> Thou hast brought me wolves in malice,<br> Driven bears within my hurdles!<br> These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br> "Have I evil done as shepherd,<br> Worse the conduct of the hostess;<br> Baked a stone inside my oat-cake,<br> On the inside, rock and tan-bark,<br> On the stone my knife, was broken,<br> Treasure of my mother's household,<br> Broken virtue of my people!"<br> Ilmarinen's wife made answer:<br> "Noble herdsman, Kullerwoinen,<br> Change, I pray thee, thine opinion,<br> Take away thine incantations,<br> From the bears and wolves release me,<br> Save me from this spell of torture<br> I will give thee better raiment,<br> Give the best of milk and butter,<br> Set for thee the sweetest table;<br> Thou shalt live with me in welcome,<br> Need not labor for thy keeping.<br> If thou dost not free me quickly,<br> Dost not break this spell of magic,<br> I shall sink into the Death-land,<br> Shall return to Tuonela."<br> This is Kullerwoinen's answer:<br> "It is best that thou shouldst perish,<br> Let destruction overtake thee,<br> There is ample room in Mana,<br> Room for all the dead in Kalma,<br> There the worthiest must slumber,<br> There must rest the good and evil."<br> Ilmarinen's wife made answer:<br> "Ukko, thou O God in heaven,<br> Span the strongest of thy cross-bows,<br> Test the weapon by thy wisdom,<br> Lay an arrow forged from copper,<br> On the cross-bow of thy forging;<br> Rightly aim thy flaming arrow,<br> With thy magic hurl the missile,<br> Shoot this wizard through the vitals,<br> Pierce the heart of Kullerwoinen<br> With the lightning of the heavens,<br> With thine arrows tipped with copper."<br> Kullerwoinen prays as follows:<br> "Ukko, God of truth and justice.<br> Do not slay thy magic servant,<br> Slay the wife of Ilmarinen,<br> Kill in her the worst of women,<br> In these hurdles let her perish,<br> Lest she wander hence in freedom,<br> To perform some other mischief,<br> Do some greater deed of malice!"</p> 
<p>Quick as lightning fell the hostess,<br> Quick the wife of Ilmarinen<br> Fell and perished in the hurdles,<br> On the ground before her cottage<br> Thus the death of Northland's hostess,<br> Cherished wife of Ilmarinen,<br> Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Wooed and watched for many summers,<br> Pride and joy of Kalevala!</p>
