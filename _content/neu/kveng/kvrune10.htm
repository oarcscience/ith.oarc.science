<p>WAINAMOINEN, the magician,<br> Takes his steed of copper color,<br> Hitches quick his fleet-foot courser,<br> Puts his racer to the snow-sledge,<br> Straightway springs upon the cross-seat,<br> Snaps his whip adorned with jewels.<br> Like the winds the steed flies onward,<br> Like a lightning flash, the racer<br> Makes the snow-sledge creak and rattle,<br> Makes the highway quickly vanish,<br> Dashes on through fen and forest,<br> Over hills and through the valleys,<br> Over marshes, over mountains,<br> Over fertile plains and meadows;<br> Journeys one day, then a second,<br> So a third from morn till evening,<br> Till the third day evening brings him<br> To the endless bridge of Osmo,<br> To the Osmo-fields and pastures,<br> To the plains of Kalevala;<br> When the hero spake as follows:<br> "May the wolves devour the dreamer,<br> Eat the Laplander for dinner,<br> May disease destroy the braggart,<br> Him who said that I should never<br> See again my much-loved home-land,<br> Nevermore behold my kindred,<br> Never during all my life-time,<br> Never while the sunshine brightens,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers<br> On the meadows of Wainola,<br> On the plains of Kalevala."</p> 
<p>Then began old Wainamoinen,<br> Ancient bard and famous singer,<br> To renew his incantations;<br> Sang aloft a wondrous pine-tree,<br> Till it pierced the clouds in growing<br> With its golden top and branches,<br> Till it touched the very heavens,<br> Spread its branches in the ether,<br> In the ever-shining sunlight.</p> 
<p>Now he sings again enchanting,<br> Sings the Moon to shine forever<br> In the fir-tree's emerald branches;<br> In its top he sings the Great Bear.<br> Then be quickly journeys homeward,<br> Hastens to his golden portals,<br> Head awry and visage wrinkled,<br> Crooked cap upon his forehead,<br> Since as ransom he had promised<br> Ilmarinen, magic artist,<br> Thus to save his life from torture<br> On the distant fields of Northland<br> In the dismal Sariola.</p> 
<p>When his stallion he had halted<br> On the Osmo-field and meadow,<br> Quickly rising in his snow-sledge,<br> The magician heard one knocking,<br> Breaking coal within the smithy,<br> Beating with a heavy hammer.<br> Wainamoinen, famous minstrel,<br> Entering the smithy straightway,<br> Found the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Knocking with his copper hammer.<br> Ilmarinen spake as follows:<br> "Welcome, brother Wainamoinen,<br> Old and worthy Wainamoinen!<br> Why so long hast thou been absent,<br> Where hast thou so long been hiding?"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen then made answer,<br> These the words of the magician:<br> "Long indeed have I been living,<br> Many dreary days have wandered,<br> Many cheerless nights have lingered,<br> Floating on the cruel ocean,<br> Weeping in the fens and woodlands<br> Of the never-pleasant Northland,<br> In the dismal Sariola;<br> With the Laplanders I've wandered,<br> With the people filled with witchcraft."</p> 
<p>Promptly answers Ilmarinen,<br> These the words the blacksmith uses:<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Famous and eternal singer,<br> Tell me of thy journey northward,<br> Of thy wanderings in Lapland,<br> Of thy dismal journey homeward."<br> Spake the minstrel, Wainamoinen:<br> "I have much to tell thee, brother,<br> Listen to my wondrous story:<br> In the Northland lives a virgin,<br> In a village there, a maiden,<br> That will not accept a lover,<br> That a hero's hand refuses,<br> That a wizard's heart disdaineth;<br> All of Northland sings her praises,<br> Sings her worth and magic beauty,<br> Fairest maiden of Pohyola,<br> Daughter of the earth and ocean.<br> From her temples beams the moonlight,<br> From her breast, the gleam of sunshine,<br> From her forehead shines the rainbow,<br> On her neck, the seven starlets,<br> And the Great Bear from her shoulder.</p> 
<p>"Ilmarinen, worthy brother,<br> Thou the only skilful blacksmith,<br> Go and see her wondrous beauty,<br> See her gold and silver garments,<br> See her robed in finest raiment,<br> See her sitting on the rainbow,<br> Walking on the clouds of purple.<br> Forge for her the magic Sampo,<br> Forge the lid in many colors,<br> Thy reward shall be the virgin,<br> Thou shalt win this bride of beauty;<br> Go and bring the lovely maiden<br> To thy home in Kalevala."<br> Spake the brother, Ilmarinen:<br> O thou cunning Wainamoinen,<br> Thou hast promised me already<br> To the ever-darksome Northland,<br> Thy devoted head to ransom,<br> Thus to rescue thee from trouble.<br> I shall never visit Northland,<br> Shall not go to see thy maiden,<br> Do not love the Bride of Beauty;<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers,<br> Shall I go to dreary Pohya,<br> To the plains of Sariola,<br> Where the people eat each other,<br> Sink their heroes in the ocean,<br> Not for all the maids of Lapland."<br> Spake the brother, Wainamoinen:<br> "I can tell thee greater wonders,<br> Listen to my wondrous story:<br> I have seen the fir-tree blossom,<br> Seen its flowers with emerald branches,<br> On the Osmo-fields and woodlands;<br> In its top, there shines the moonlight,<br> And the Bear lives in its branches."<br> Ilmarinen thus made answer:<br> "I cannot believe thy story,<br> Cannot trust thy tale of wonder,<br> Till I see the blooming fir-tree,<br> With its many emerald branches,<br> With its Bear and golden moonlight."<br> This is Wainamoinen's answer:<br> "Wilt thou not believe my story?<br> Come with me and I will show thee<br> If my lips speak fact or fiction."<br> Quick they journey to discover,<br> Haste to view the wondrous fir-tree;<br> Wainamoinen leads the journey,<br> Ilmarinen closely follows.<br> As they near the Osmo-borders,<br> Ilmarinen hastens forward<br> That be may behold the wonder,<br> Spies the Bear Within the fir-top,<br> Sitting on its emerald branches,<br> Spies the gleam of golden moonlight.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,</p> 
<p>These the words the singer uttered:<br> Climb this tree, dear Ilmarinen,<br> And bring down the golden moonbeams,<br> Bring the Moon and Bear down with thee<br> From the fir-tree's lofty branches."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, full consenting,<br> Straightway climbed the golden fir-tree,<br> High upon the bow of heaven,<br> Thence to bring the golden moonbeams,<br> Thence to bring the Bear of heaven,<br> From the fir-tree's topmost branches.</p> 
<p>Thereupon the blooming fir-tree<br> Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br> "O thou senseless, thoughtless hero,<br> Thou hast neither wit nor instinct;<br> Thou dost climb my golden branches,<br> Like a thing of little judgment,<br> Thus to get my pictured moonbeams,<br> Take away my silver starlight,<br> Steal my Bear and blooming branches."</p> 
<p>Quick as thought old Wainamoinen<br> Sang again in magic accents,<br> Sang a storm-wind in the heavens,<br> Sang the wild winds into fury,<br> And the singer spake as follows:<br> `Take, O storm-wind, take the forgeman,<br> Carry him within thy vessel,<br> Quickly hence, and land the hero<br> On the ever-darksome Northland,<br> On the dismal Sariola."</p> 
<p>Now the storm-wind quickly darkens,<br> Quickly piles the air together,<br> Makes of air a sailing vessel,<br> Takes the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Fleetly from the fir-tree branches,<br> Toward the never-pleasant Northland,<br> Toward the dismal Sariola.<br> Through the air sailed Ilmarinen,<br> Fast and far the hero travelled,<br> Sweeping onward, sailing northward,<br> Riding in the track of storm-winds,<br> O'er the Moon, beneath the sunshine,<br> On the broad back of the Great Bear,<br> Till he neared Pohyola's woodlands,<br> Neared the homes of Sariola,<br> And alighted undiscovered,<br> Was Dot noticed by the hunters,<br> Was not scented by the watch-dogs.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Ancient, toothless dame of Northland,<br> Standing in the open court-yard,<br> Thus addresses Ilmarinen,<br> As she spies the hero-stranger:<br> "Who art thou of ancient heroes,<br> Who of all the host of heroes,<br> Coming here upon the storm-wind,<br> O'er the sledge-path of the ether,<br> Scented not by Pohya's watch-dogs?<br> This is Ilmarinen's answer:<br> "I have surely not come hither<br> To be barked at by the watch-dogs,<br> At these unfamiliar portals,<br> At the gates of Sariola."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the Northland hostess<br> Asks again the hero-stranger:<br> "Hast thou ever been acquainted<br> With the blacksmith of Wainola,<br> With the hero, Ilmarinen,<br> With the skilful smith and artist?<br> Long I've waited for his coming,<br> Long this one has been expected,<br> On the borders of the Northland,<br> Here to forge for me the Sampo."<br> Spake the hero, Ilmarinen:<br> "Well indeed am I acquainted<br> With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> I myself am Ilmarinen,<br> I, the skilful smith and artist."</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Toothless dame of Sariola,<br> Straightway rushes to her dwelling,<br> These the words that Louhi utters:<br> "Come, thou youngest of my daughters,<br> Come, thou fairest of my maidens,<br> Dress thyself in finest raiment,<br> Deck thy hair with rarest jewels,<br> Pearls upon thy swelling bosom,<br> On thy neck, a golden necklace,<br> Bind thy head with silken ribbons,<br> Make thy cheeks look fresh and ruddy,<br> And thy visage fair and winsome,<br> Since the artist, Ilmarinen,<br> Hither comes from Kalevala,<br> Here to forge for us the Sampo,<br> Hammer us the lid in colors."</p> 
<p>Now the daughter of the Northland,<br> Honored by the land and water,<br> Straightway takes her choicest raiment,<br> Takes her dresses rich in beauty,<br> Finest of her silken wardrobe,<br> Now adjusts her silken fillet,<br> On her brow a band of copper,<br> Round her waist a golden girdle,<br> Round her neck a pearly necklace,<br> Shining gold upon her bosom,<br> In her hair the threads of silver.<br> From her dressing-room she hastens,<br> To the hall she bastes and listens,<br> Full of beauty, full of joyance,<br> Ears erect and eyes bright-beaming,<br> Ruddy cheeks and charming visage,<br> Waiting for the hero-stranger.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Leads the hero, Ilmarinen,<br> To her dwelling-rooms in Northland,<br> To her home in Sariola,<br> Seats him at her well-filled table,<br> Gives to him the finest viands,<br> Gives him every needed comfort,<br> Then addresses him as follows:<br> "O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Master of the forge and smithy,<br> Canst thou forge for me the Sampo,<br> Hammer me the lid in colors,<br> From the tips of white-swan feathers,<br> From the milk of greatest virtue,<br> From a single grain of barley,<br> From the finest wool of lambkins?<br> Thou shalt have my fairest daughter,<br> Recompense for this thy service."<br> These the words of Ilmarinen:<br> "I will forge for thee the Sampo,<br> Hammer thee the lid in colors,<br> From the tips of white-swan feathers,<br> From the milk of greatest virtue,<br> From a single grain of barley,<br> From the finest wool of lambkins?<br> Since I forged the arch of heaven,<br> Forged the air a concave cover,<br> Ere the earth had a beginning."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the magic blacksmith<br> Went to forge the wondrous Sampo,<br> Went to find a blacksmith's workshop,<br> Went to find the tools to work with;<br> But he found no place for forging,<br> Found no smithy, found no bellows,<br> Found no chimney, found no anvil,<br> Found no tongs, and found no hammer.</p> 
<p>Then the-artist, Ilmarinen.<br> Spake these words, soliloquizing:<br> "Only women grow discouraged,<br> Only knaves leave work unfinished,<br> Not the devils, nor the heroes,<br> Nor the Gods of greater knowledge."</p> 
<p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Sought a place to build a smithy,<br> Sought a place to plant a bellows,<br> On the borders of the Northland,<br> On the Pohya-hills and meadows;<br> Searched one day, and then a second;<br> Ere the evening of the third day,<br> Came a rock within his vision,<br> Came a stone with rainbow-colors.<br> There the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Set at work to build his smithy,<br> Built a fire and raised a chimney;<br> On the next day laid his bellows,<br> On the third day built his furnace,<br> And began to forge the Sampo.</p> 
<p>The eternal magic artist,<br> Ancient blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> First of all the iron-workers,<br> Mixed together certain metals,<br> Put the mixture in the caldron,<br> Laid it deep within the furnace,<br> Called the hirelings to the forging.<br> Skilfully they work the bellows,<br> Tend the fire and add the fuel,<br> Three most lovely days of summer,<br> Three short nights of bright midsummer,<br> Till the rocks begin to blossom,<br> In the foot-prints of the workmen,<br> From the magic heat and furnace.</p> 
<p>On the first day, Ilmarinen<br> Downward bent and well examined,<br> On the bottom of his furnace,<br> Thus to see what might be forming<br> From the magic fire and metals.<br> From the fire arose a cross-bow,<br> "With the brightness of the moonbeams,<br> Golden bow with tips of silver;<br> On the shaft was shining copper,<br> And the bow was strong and wondrous,<br> But alas! it was ill-natured,<br> Asking for a hero daily,<br> Two the heads it asked on feast-days.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, skilful artist,<br> Was not pleased with this creation,<br> Broke the bow in many pieces,<br> Threw them back within the furnace,<br> Kept the workmen at the bellows,<br> Tried to forge the magic Sampo.</p> 
<p>On the second day, the blacksmith<br> Downward bent and well examined,<br> On the bottom of the furnace;<br> From the fire, a skiff of metals,<br> Came a boat of purple color,<br> All the ribs were colored golden,<br> And the oars were forged from copper;<br> Thus the skiff was full of beauty,<br> But alas! a thing of evil;<br> Forth it rushes into trouble,<br> Hastens into every quarrel,<br> Hastes without a provocation<br> Into every evil combat.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, metal artist,<br> Is not pleased with this creation,<br> Breaks the skiff in many fragments,<br> Throws them back within the furnace,<br> Keeps the workmen at the bellows,<br> Thus to forge the magic Sampo.</p> 
<p>On the third day, Ilmarinen,<br> First of all the metal-workers,<br> Downward bent and well examined,<br> On the bottom of the furnace;<br> There be saw a heifer rising,<br> Golden were the horns of Kimmo,<br> On her head the Bear of heaven,<br> On her brow a disc of sunshine,<br> Beautiful the cow of magic;<br> But alas! she is ill-tempered,<br> Rushes headlong through the forest,<br> Rushes through the swamps and meadows,<br> Wasting all her milk in running.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, the magician.<br> Is not pleased with this creation,<br> Cuts the magic cow in pieces,<br> Throws them in the fiery furnace,<br> Sets the workmen at the bellows,<br> Thus to forge the magic Sampo.</p> 
<p>On the fourth day, Ilmarinen<br> Downward bent and well examined,<br> To the bottom of the furnace;<br> There beheld a plow in beauty<br> Rising from the fire of metals,<br> Golden was the point and plowshare,<br> And the beam was forged from copper,<br> And the handles, molten silver,<br> Beautiful the plow and wondrous;<br> But alas! it is ill-mannered,<br> Plows up fields of corn and barley,<br> Furrows through the richest meadows.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, metal artist,<br> Is not pleased with this creation,<br> Quickly breaks the plow in pieces,<br> Throws them back within the furnace,<br> Lets the winds attend the bellows,<br> Lets the storm-winds fire the metals.<br> Fiercely vie the winds of heaven,<br> East-wind rushing, West-wind roaring,<br> South-wind crying, North-wind howling,<br> Blow one day and then a second,<br> Blow the third from morn till even,<br> When the fire leaps through the windows,<br> Through the door the sparks fly upward,<br> Clouds of smoke arise to heaven;<br> With the clouds the black smoke mingles,<br> As the storm-winds ply the bellows.</p> 
<p>On the third night Ilmarinen,<br> Bending low to view his metals,<br> On the bottom of the furnace,<br> Sees the magic Sampo rising,<br> Sees the lid in many colors.<br> Quick the artist of Wainola<br> Forges with the tongs and anvil,<br> Knocking with a heavy hammer,<br> Forges skilfully the Sampo;<br> On one side the flour is grinding,<br> On another salt is making,<br> On a third is money forging,<br> And the lid is many-colored.<br> Well the Sampo grinds when finished,<br> To and fro the lid in rocking,<br> Grinds one measure at the day-break,<br> Grinds a measure fit for eating,<br> Grinds a second for the market,<br> Grinds a third one for the store-house.</p> 
<p>Joyfully the dame of Northland,<br> Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Takes away the magic Sampo,<br> To the hills of Sariola,<br> To the copper-bearing mountains,<br> Puts nine locks upon the wonder,<br> Makes three strong roots creep around it;<br> In the earth they grow nine fathoms,<br> One large root beneath the mountain,<br> One beneath the sandy sea-bed,<br> One beneath the mountain-dwelling.</p> 
<p>Modestly pleads Ilmarinen<br> For the maiden's willing answer,<br> These the words of the magician:<br> "Wilt thou come with me, fair maiden,<br> Be my wife and queen forever?<br> I have forged for thee the Sampo,<br> Forged the lid in many colors."</p> 
<p>Northland's fair and lovely daughter<br> Answers thus the metal-worker:<br> "Who will in the coming spring-time,<br> Who will in the second summer,<br> Guide the cuckoo's song and echo?<br> Who will listen to his calling,<br> Who will sing with him in autumn,<br> Should I go to distant regions,<br> Should this cheery maiden vanish<br> From the fields of Sariola,<br> From Pohyola's fens and forests,<br> Where the cuckoo sings and echoes?<br> Should I leave my father's dwelling,<br> Should my mother's berry vanish,<br> Should these mountains lose their cherry,<br> Then the cuckoo too would vanish,<br> All the birds would leave the forest,<br> Leave the summit of the mountain,<br> Leave my native fields and woodlands,<br> Never shall I, in my life-time,<br> Say farewell to maiden freedom,<br> Nor to summer cares and labors,<br> Lest the harvest be ungarnered,<br> Lest the berries be ungathered,<br> Lest the song-birds leave the forest,<br> Lest the mermaids leave the waters,<br> Lest I sing with them no longer."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, the magician,<br> The eternal metal-forger,<br> Cap awry and head dejected,<br> Disappointed, heavy-hearted,<br> Empty-handed, well considers,<br> How to reach his distant country,<br> Reach his much-loved home and kinded,<br> Gain the meadows of Wainola,<br> From the never-pleasant Northland,<br> From the darksome Sariola.<br> Louhi thus addressed the suitor:<br> "O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Why art thou so heavy-hearted,<br> Why thy visage so dejected?<br> Hast thou in thy mind to journey<br> From the vales and hills of Pohya,<br> To the meadows of Wainola,<br> To thy home in Kalevala?<br> This is Ilmarinen's answer:<br> "Thitherward my mind is tending,<br> To my home-land let me journey,<br> With my kindred let me linger,<br> Be at rest in mine own country."</p> 
<p>Straightway Louhi, dame of Northland,<br> Gave the hero every comfort,<br> Gave him food and rarest viands,<br> Placed him in a boat of copper,<br> In a copper-banded vessel,<br> Called the winds to his assistance,<br> Made the North-wind guide him homeward.<br> Thus the skilful Ilmarinen<br> Travels toward his native country,<br> On the blue back of the waters,<br> Travels one day, then a second,<br> Till the third day evening brings him<br> To Wainola's peaceful meadows,<br> To his home in Kalevala.</p> 
<p>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<br> Thus addresses Ilmarinen:<br> "O my brother, metal-artist,<br> Thou eternal wonder-worker,<br> Didst thou forge the magic Sampo,<br> Forge the lid in many colors?"</p> 
<p>Spake the brother, Ilmarinen,<br> These the words the master uttered:<br> "Yea, I forged the magic Sampo,<br> Forged the lid in many colors;<br> To and fro the lid in rocking<br> Grinds one measure at the day-dawn,<br> Grinds a measure fit for eating,<br> Grinds a second for the market,<br> Grinds a third one for the store-house.<br> Louhi has the wondrous Sampo,<br> I have not the Bride of Beauty."</p>
