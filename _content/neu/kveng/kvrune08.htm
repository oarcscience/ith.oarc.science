<p>Pohyola's fair and winsome daughter,<br> Glory of the land and water,<br> Sat upon the bow of heaven,<br> On its highest arch resplendent,<br> In a gown of richest fabric,<br> In a gold and silver air-gown,<br> Weaving webs of golden texture,<br> Interlacing threads of silver;<br> Weaving with a golden shuttle,<br> With a weaving-comb of silver;<br> Merrily flies the golden shuttle,<br> From the maiden's nimble fingers,<br> Briskly swings the lathe in weaving,<br> Swiftly flies the comb of silver,<br> From the sky-born maiden's fingers,<br> Weaving webs of wondrous beauty.</p> 
<p>Came the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Driving down the highway homeward,<br> From the ever sunless Northland,<br> From the dismal Sariola;<br> Few the furlongs he had driven,<br> Driven but a little distance,<br> When he heard the sky-loom buzzing,<br> As the maiden plied the shuttle.<br> Quick the thoughtless Wainamoinen<br> Lifts his eyes aloft in wonder,<br> Looks upon the vault of heaven,<br> There beholds the bow of beauty,<br> On the bow the maiden sitting,<br> Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Glory of the earth and ocean,<br> Weaving there a golden fabric,<br> Working with the rustling silver.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Quickly checks his fleet-foot racer,<br> Looks upon the charming maiden,<br> Then addresses her as follows:<br> "Come, fair maiden, to my snow-sledge,<br> By my side I wish thee seated."</p> 
<p>Thus the Maid of Beauty answers:<br> "Tell me what thou wishest of me,<br> Should I join thee in the snow-sledge."<br> Speaks the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Answers thus the Maid of Beauty:<br> "This the reason for thy coming:<br> Thou shalt bake me honey-biscuit,<br> Shalt prepare me barley-water,<br> Thou shalt fill my foaming beer-cups,<br> Thou shalt sing beside my table,<br> Shalt rejoice within my portals,<br> Walk a queen within my dwelling,<br> In the Wainola halls and chambers,<br> In the courts of Kalevala."</p> 
<p>Thus the Maid of Beauty answered<br> From her throne amid the heavens:<br> "Yesterday at hour of twilight,<br> Went I to the flowery meadows,<br> There to rock upon the common,<br> Where the Sun retires to slumber;<br> There I heard a song-bird singing,<br> Heard the thrush simple measures,<br> Singing sweetly thoughts of maidens,<br> And the minds of anxious mothers.</p> 
<p>"Then I asked the pretty songster,<br> Asked the thrush this simple question:<br> 'Sing to me, thou pretty song-bird,<br> Sing that I may understand thee,<br> Sing to me in truthful accents,<br> How to live in greatest pleasure,<br> And in happiness the sweetest,<br> As a maiden with her father,<br> Or as wife beside her husband.'</p> 
<p>"Thus the song-bird gave me answer,<br> Sang the thrush this information:<br> 'Bright and warm are days of summer,<br> Warmer still is maiden-freedom;<br> Cold is iron in the winter,<br> Thus the lives of married women;<br> Maidens living with their mothers<br> Are like ripe and ruddy berries;<br> Married women, far too many,<br> Are like dogs enchained in kennel,<br> Rarely do they ask for favors,<br> Not to wives are favors given.'"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Answers thus the Maid of Beauty:<br> "Foolish is the thrush thus singing,<br> Nonsense is the song-bird's twitter;<br> Like to babes are maidens treated,<br> Wives are queens and highly honored.<br> Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,<br> I am not despised as hero,<br> Not the meanest of magicians;<br> Come with me and I will make thee<br> Wife and queen in Kalevala."<br> Thus the Maid of Beauty answered--<br> "Would consider thee a hero,<br> Mighty hero, I would call thee,<br> When a golden hair thou splittest,<br> Using knives that have no edges;<br> When thou snarest me a bird's egg<br> With a snare that I can see not."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, skilled and ancient,<br> Split a golden hair exactly,<br> Using knives that had no edges;<br> And he snared an egg as nicely<br> With a snare the maiden saw not.</p> 
<p>"Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,<br> I have done what thou desirest."<br> Thus the maiden wisely answered:<br> "Never enter I thy snow-sledge,<br> Till thou peelest me the sandstone,<br> Till thou cuttest me a whip-stick<br> From the ice, and make no splinters,<br> Losing not the smallest fragment."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, true magician,<br> Nothing daunted, not discouraged,<br> Deftly peeled the rounded sandstone,<br> Deftly cut from ice a whip-stick,<br> Cutting not the finest splinter,<br> Losing not the smallest fragment.<br> Then again be called the maiden,<br> To a seat within his snow-sledge.</p> 
<p>But the Maid or Beauty answered,<br> Answered thus the great magician:<br> I will go with that one only<br> That will make me ship or shallop,<br> From the splinters of my spindle,<br> From the fragments of my distaff,<br> In the waters launch the vessel,<br> Set the little ship a-floating,<br> Using not the knee to push it,<br> Using not the arm to move it,<br> Using not the hand to touch it,<br> Using not the foot to turn it,<br> Using nothing to propel it."</p> 
<p>Spake the skilful Wainamoinen,<br> These the words the hero uttered:<br> "There is no one in the Northland,<br> No one under vault of heaven,<br> Who like me can build a vessel,<br> From the fragments of the distaff,<br> From the splinters of the spindle."</p> 
<p>Then he took the distaff-fragments,<br> Took the splinters of the spindle,<br> Hastened off the boat to fashion,<br> Hastened to an iron mountain,<br> There to join the many fragments.<br> Full of zeal be plies the hammer,<br> Swings the hammer and the hatchet;<br> Nothing daunted, builds the vessel,<br> Works one day and then a second,<br> Works with steady hand the third day;<br> On the evening of the third day,<br> Evil Hisi grasps the hatchet,<br> Lempo takes the crooked handle,<br> Turns aside the axe in falling,<br> Strikes the rocks and breaks to pieces;<br> From the rocks rebound the fragments,<br> Pierce the flesh of the magician,<br> Cut the knee of Wainamoinen.<br> Lempo guides the sharpened hatchet,<br> And the veins fell Hisi severs.<br> Quickly gushes forth a blood-stream,<br> And the stream is crimson-colored.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> The renowned and wise enchanter,<br> Thus outspeaks in measured accents:<br> "O thou keen and cruel hatchet,<br> O thou axe of sharpened metal,<br> Thou shouldst cut the trees to fragments,<br> Cut the pine-tree and the willow,<br> Cut the alder and the birch-tree,<br> Cut the juniper and aspen,<br> Shouldst not cut my knee to pieces,<br> Shouldst not tear my veins asunder."</p> 
<p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Thus begins his incantations,<br> Thus begins his magic singing,<br> Of the origin of evil;<br> Every word in perfect order,<br> Makes no effort to remember,<br> Sings the origin of iron,<br> That a bolt he well may fashion,<br> Thus prepare a look for surety,<br> For the wounds the axe has given,<br> That the hatchet has torn open.<br> But the stream flows like a brooklet,<br> Rushing like a maddened torrent,<br> Stains the herbs upon the meadows,<br> Scarcely is a bit of verdure<br> That the blood-stream does not cover<br> As it flows and rushes onward<br> From the knee of the magician,<br> From the veins of Wainamoinen.</p> 
<p>Now the wise and ancient minstrel<br> Gathers lichens from the sandstone,<br> Picks them from the trunks of birches,<br> Gathers moss within the marshes,<br> Pulls the grasses from the meadows,<br> Thus to stop the crimson streamlet,<br> Thus to close the wounds laid open;<br> But his work is unsuccessful,<br> And the crimson stream flows onward.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Feeling pain and fearing languor,<br> Falls to weeping, heavy-hearted;<br> Quickly now his steed he hitches,<br> Hitches to the sledge of birch-wood,<br> Climbs with pain upon the cross-bench,<br> Strikes his steed in quick succession,<br> Snaps his whip above the racer,<br> And the steed flies onward swiftly;<br> Like the winds he sweeps the highway,<br> Till be nears a Northland village,<br> Where the way is triple-parted.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Takes the lowest of the highways,<br> Quickly nears a spacious cottage,<br> Quickly asks before the doorway:<br> "Is there any one here dwelling,<br> That can know the pain I suffer,<br> That can heal this wound of hatchet.<br> That can check this crimson streamlet?"</p> 
<p>Sat a boy within a corner,<br> On a bench beside a baby,<br> And he answered thus the hero:<br> "There is no one in this dwelling<br> That can know the pain thou feelest,<br> That can heal the wounds of hatchet,<br> That can check the crimson streamlet;<br> Some one lives in yonder cottage,<br> That perchance can do thee service."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Whips his courser to a gallop,<br> Dashes on along the highway;<br> Only drives a little distance,<br> On the middle of the highways,<br> To a cabin on the road-side, <br> Asks one standing on the threshold,<br> Questions all through open windows,<br> These the words the hero uses:<br> "Is there no one in this cabin,<br> That can know the pain I suffer,<br> That can heal this wound of hatchet,<br> That can check this crimson streamlet?"</p> 
<p>On the floor a witch was lying,<br> Near the fire-place lay the beldame,<br> Thus she spake to Wainamoinen,<br> Through her rattling teeth she answered.<br> "There is no one in this cabin<br> That can know the pain thou feelest,<br> That can heal the wounds of hatchets,<br> That can check the crimson streamlet;<br> Some one lives in yonder cottage,<br> That perchance can do thee service."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, nothing daunted,<br> Whips his racer to a gallop,<br> Dashes on along the highway;<br> Only drives a little distance,<br> On the upper of the highways,<br> Gallops to a humble cottage,<br> Asks one standing near the penthouse,<br> Sitting on the penthouse-doorsill:<br> "Is there no one in this cottage,<br> That can know the pain I suffer,<br> That can heal this wound of hatchet,<br> That can check this crimson streamlet?"</p> 
<p>Near the fireplace sat an old man,<br> On the hearthstone sat the gray-beard,<br> Thus he answered Wainamoinen:<br> "Greater things have been accomplished,<br> Much more wondrous things effected,<br> Through but three words of the master;<br> Through the telling of the causes,<br> Streams and oceans have been tempered,<br> River cataracts been lessened,<br> Bays been made of promontories,<br> Islands raised from deep sea-bottoms."</p>
