<p>Now we sing the wondrous legends,<br> Songs of wedding-feasts and dances,<br> Sing the melodies of wedlock,<br> Sing the songs of old tradition;<br> Sing of Ilmarinen's marriage<br> To the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Fairest daughter of the Northland,<br> Sing the drinking-songs of Pohya.</p> 
<p>Long prepared they for the wedding<br> In Pohyola's halls and chambers,<br> In the courts of Sariola;<br> Many things that Louhi ordered,<br> Great indeed the preparations<br> For the marriage of the daughter,<br> For the feasting of the heroes,<br> For the drinking of the strangers,<br> For the feeding of the poor-folk,<br> For the people's entertainment.</p> 
<p>Grew an ox in far Karjala,<br> Not the largest, nor the smallest,<br> Was the ox that grew in Suomi;<br> But his size was all-sufficient,<br> For his tail was sweeping Jamen,<br> And his head was over Kemi,<br> Horns in length a hundred fathoms,<br> Longer than the horns his mouth was;<br> Seven days it took a weasel<br> To encircle neck and shoulders;<br> One whole day a swallow journeyed<br> From one horn-tip to the other,<br> Did not stop between for resting.<br> Thirty days the squirrel travelled<br> From the tail to reach the shoulders,<br> But he could not gain the horn-tip<br> Till the Moon had long passed over.</p> 
<p>This young ox of huge dimensions,<br> This great calf of distant Suomi,<br> Was conducted from Karjala<br> To the meadows of Pohyola;<br> At each horn a hundred heroes,<br> At his head and neck a thousand.<br> When the mighty ox was lassoed,<br> Led away to Northland pastures,<br> Peacefully the monster journeyed<br> By the bays of Sariola,<br> Ate the pasture on the borders;<br> To the clouds arose his shoulders,<br> And his horns to highest heaven.<br> Not in all of Sariola<br> Could a butcher be discovered<br> That could kill the ox for Louhi,<br> None of all the sons of Northland,<br> In her hosts of giant people,<br> In her rising generation,<br> In the hosts of those grown older.</p> 
<p>Came a hero from a distance,<br> Wirokannas from Karelen,<br> And these words the gray-beard uttered:<br> "Wait, O wait, thou ox of Suomi,<br> Till I bring my ancient war-club;<br> Then I'll smite thee on thy forehead,<br> Break thy skull, thou willing victim!<br> Nevermore wilt thou in summer<br> Browse the woods of Sariola,<br> Bare our pastures, fields, and forests;<br> Thou, O ox, wilt feed no longer<br> Through the length and breadth of Northland,<br> On the borders of this ocean!"</p> 
<p>When the ancient Wirokannas<br> Started out the ox to slaughter,<br> When Palwoinen swung his war-club,<br> Quick the victim turned his forehead,<br> Flashed his flaming eyes upon him;<br> To the fir-tree leaped the hero,<br> In the thicket hid Palwoinen,<br> Hid the gray-haired Wirokannas.</p> 
<p>Everywhere they seek a butcher,<br> One to kill the ox of Suomi,<br> In the country of Karelen,<br> And among the Suomi-giants,<br> In the quiet fields of Ehstland,<br> On the battle-fields of Sweden,<br> Mid the mountaineers of Lapland,<br> In the magic fens of Turya;<br> Seek him in Tuoni's empire,<br> In the death-courts of Manala.<br> Long the search, and unsuccessful,<br> On the blue back of the ocean,<br> On the far-outstretching pastures.</p> 
<p>There arose from out the sea-waves,<br> Rose a hero from the waters,<br> On the white-capped, roaring breakers,<br> From the water's broad expanses;<br> Nor belonged he to the largest,<br> Nor belonged he to the smallest;<br> Made his bed within a sea-shell,<br> Stood erect beneath a flour-sieve,<br> Hero old, with hands of iron,<br> And his face was copper-colored;<br> Quick the hero full unfolded,<br> Like the full corn from the kernel.<br> On his head a hat of flint-stone,<br> On his feet were sandstone-sandals,<br> In his hand a golden cleaver,<br> And the blade was copper-handled.<br> Thus at last they found a butcher,<br> Found the magic ox a slayer.<br> Nothing has been found so mighty<br> That it has not found a master.</p> 
<p>As the sea-god saw his booty,<br> Quickly rushed he on his victim,<br> Hurled him to his knees before him,<br> Quickly felled the calf of Suomi,<br> Felled the young ox of Karelen.<br> Bountifully meat was furnished;<br> Filled at least a thousand hogsheads<br> Of his blood were seven boatfuls,<br> And a thousand weight of suet,<br> For the banquet of Pohyola,<br> For the marriage-feast of Northland.</p> 
<p>In Pohyola was a guest-room,<br> Ample was the hall of Louhi,<br> Was in length a hundred furlongs,<br> And in breadth was nearly fifty;<br> When upon the roof a rooster<br> Crowed at break of early morning,<br> No one on the earth could hear him;<br> When the dog barked at one entrance,<br> None could hear him at the other.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Hastens to the hall and court-room,<br> In the centre speaks as follows:<br> "Whence indeed will come the liquor,<br> Who will brew me beer from barley,<br> Who will make the mead abundant,<br> For the people of the Northland,<br> Coming to my daughter's marriage,<br> To her drinking-feast and nuptials?<br> Cannot comprehend the malting,<br> Never have I learned the secret,<br> Nor the origin of brewing."<br> Spake an old man from his corner:<br> "Beer arises from the barley,<br> Comes from barley, hops, and water,<br> And the fire gives no assistance.<br> Hop-vine was the son of Remu,<br> Small the seed in earth was planted,<br> Cultivated in the loose soil,<br> Scattered like the evil serpents<br> On the brink of Kalew-waters,<br> On the Osmo-fields and borders.<br> There the young plant grew and flourished,<br> There arose the climbing hop-vine,<br> Clinging to the rocks and alders.</p> 
<p>"Man of good-luck sowed the barley<br> On the Osmo hills and lowlands,<br> And the barley grew and flourished,<br> Grew and spread in rich abundance,<br> Fed upon the air and water,<br> On the Osmo plains and highlands,<br> On the fields of Kalew-heroes.</p> 
<p>"Time had travelled little distance,<br> Ere the hops in trees were humming,<br> Barley in the fields was singing,<br> And from Kalew's well the water,<br> This the language of the trio:<br> 'Let us join our triple forces,<br> Join to each the other's powers;<br> Sad alone to live and struggle,<br> Little use in working singly,<br> Better we should toil together.'</p> 
<p>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<br> Brewer of the drink refreshing,<br> Takes the golden grains of barley,<br> Taking six of barley-kernels,<br> Taking seven tips of hop-fruit,<br> Filling seven cups with water,<br> On the fire she sets the caldron,<br> Boils the barley, hops, and water,<br> Lets them steep, and seethe, and bubble<br> Brewing thus the beer delicious,<br> In the hottest days of summer,<br> On the foggy promontory,<br> On the island forest-covered;<br> Poured it into birch-wood barrels,<br> Into hogsheads made of oak-wood.</p> 
<p>"Thus did Osmotar of Kalew<br> Brew together hops and barley,<br> Could not generate the ferment.<br> Thinking long and long debating,<br> Thus she spake in troubled accents:<br> 'What will bring the effervescence,<br> Who will add the needed factor,<br> That the beer may foam and sparkle,<br> May ferment and be delightful?'</p> 
<p>Kalevatar, magic maiden,<br> Grace and beauty in her fingers,<br> Swiftly moving, lightly stepping,<br> In her trimly-buckled sandals,<br> Steps upon the birch-wood bottom,<br> Turns one way, and then another,<br> In the centre of the caldron;<br> Finds within a splinter lying<br> From the bottom lifts the fragment,<br> Turns it in her fingers, musing:<br> 'What may come of this I know not,<br> In the hands of magic maidens,<br> In the virgin hands of Kapo,<br> Snowy virgin of the Northland!'</p> 
<p>"Kalevatar took the splinter<br> To the magic virgin, Kapo,<br> Who by unknown force and insight.<br> Rubbed her hands and knees together,<br> And produced a snow-white squirrel;<br> Thus instructed she her creature,<br> Gave the squirrel these directions:<br> 'Snow-white squirrel, mountain-jewel,<br> Flower of the field and forest,<br> Haste thee whither I would send thee,<br> Into Metsola's wide limits,<br> Into Tapio's seat of wisdom;<br> Hasten through the heavy tree-tops,<br> Wisely through the thickest branches,<br> That the eagle may not seize thee,<br> Thus escape the bird of heaven.<br> Bring me ripe cones from the fir-tree,<br> From the pine-tree bring me seedlings,<br> Bring them to the hands of Kapo,<br> For the beer of Osmo's daughter.'</p> 
<p>Quickly hastened forth the squirrel,<br> Quickly sped the nimble broad-tail,<br> Swiftly hopping on its journey<br> From one thicket to another,<br> From the birch-tree to the aspen,<br> From the pine-tree to the willow,<br> From the sorb-tree to the alder,<br> Jumping here and there with method,<br> Crossed the eagle-woods in safety,<br> Into Metsola's wide limits,<br> Into Tapio's seat of wisdom;<br> There perceived three magic pine-trees,<br> There perceived three smaller fir-trees,<br> Quickly climbed the dark-green branches,<br> Was not captured by the eagle,<br> Was not mangled in his talons;<br> Broke the young cones from the fir-tree,<br> Cut the shoots of pine-tree branches,<br> Hid the cones within his pouches,<br> Wrapped them in his fur-grown mittens<br> Brought them to the hands of Kapo,<br> To the magic virgin's fingers.<br> Kapo took the cones selected,<br> Laid them in the beer for ferment,<br> But it brought no effervescence,<br> And the beer was cold and lifeless.</p> 
<p>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<br> Kapo, brewer of the liquor,<br> Deeply thought and long considered:<br> 'What will bring the effervescence,<br> Who will lend me aid efficient,<br> That the beer may foam and sparkle,<br> May ferment and be refreshing?'</p> 
<p>"Kalevatar, sparkling maiden,<br> Grace and beauty in her fingers,<br> Softly moving, lightly stepping,<br> In her trimly-buckled sandals,<br> Steps again upon the bottom,<br> Turns one way and then another,<br> In the centre of the caldron,<br> Sees a chip upon the bottom,<br> Takes it from its place of resting,<br> Looks upon the chip and muses<br> 'What may come of this I know not,<br> In the hands of mystic maidens,<br> In the hands of magic Kapo,<br> In the virgin's snow-white fingers.'</p> 
<p>"Kalevatar took the birch-chip<br> To the magic maiden, Kapo,<br> Gave it to the white-faced maiden.<br> Kapo, by the aid of magic,<br> Rubbed her hands and knees together,<br> And produced a magic marten,<br> And the marten, golden-breasted;<br> Thus instructed she her creature,<br> Gave the marten these directions.<br> 'Thou, my golden-breasted marten,<br> Thou my son of golden color,<br> Haste thou whither I may send thee,<br> To the bear-dens of the mountain,<br> To the grottoes of the growler,<br> Gather yeast upon thy fingers,<br> Gather foam from lips of anger,<br> From the lips of bears in battle,<br> Bring it to the hands of Kapo,<br> To the hands of Osmo's daughter.'</p> 
<p>"Then the marten golden-breasted,<br> Full consenting, hastened onward,<br> Quickly bounding on his journey,<br> Lightly leaping through the distance<br> Leaping o'er the widest rivers,<br> Leaping over rocky fissures,<br> To the bear-dens of the mountain,<br> To the grottoes of the growler,<br> Where the wild-bears fight each other,<br> Where they pass a dread existence,<br> Iron rocks, their softest pillows,<br> In the fastnesses of mountains;<br> From their lips the foam was dripping,<br> From their tongues the froth of anger;<br> This the marten deftly gathered,<br> Brought it to the maiden, Kapo,<br> Laid it in her dainty fingers.</p> 
<p>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<br> Brewer of the beer of barley,<br> Used the beer-foam as a ferment;<br> But it brought no effervescence,<br> Did not make the liquor sparkle.</p> 
<p>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<br> Thought again, and long debated:<br> 'Who or what will bring the ferment,<br> Th at my beer may not be lifeless?'</p> 
<p>"Kalevatar, magic maiden,<br> Grace and beauty in her fingers,<br> Softly moving, lightly stepping,<br> In her trimly-buckled sandals,<br> Steps again upon the bottom,<br> Turns one way and then another,<br> In the centre of the caldron,<br> Sees a pod upon the bottom,<br> Lifts it in her snow-white fingers,<br> Turns it o'er and o'er, and muses:<br> 'What may come of this I know not,<br> In the hands of magic maidens,<br> In the hands of mystic Kapo,<br> In the snowy virgin's fingers?'</p> 
<p>"Kalevatar, sparkling maiden,<br> Gave the pod to magic Kapo;<br> Kapo, by the aid of magic,<br> Rubbed the pod upon her knee-cap,<br> And a honey-bee came flying<br> From the pod within her fingers,<br> Kapo thus addressed her birdling:<br> 'Little bee with honeyed winglets,<br> King of all the fragrant flowers,<br> Fly thou whither I direct thee,<br> To the islands in the ocean,<br> To the water-cliffs and grottoes,<br> Where asleep a maid has fallen,<br> Girdled with a belt of copper<br> By her side are honey-grasses,<br> By her lips are fragrant flowers,<br> Herbs and flowers honey-laden;<br> Gather there the sweetened juices,<br> Gather honey on thy winglets,<br> From the calyces of flowers,<br> From the tips of seven petals,<br> Bring it to the hands of Kapo,<br> To the hands of Osmo's daughter.'</p> 
<p>"Then the bee, the swift-winged birdling,<br> Flew away with lightning-swiftness<br> On his journey to the islands,<br> O'er the high waves of the ocean;<br> Journeyed one day, then a second,<br> Journeyed all the next day onward,<br> Till the third day evening brought him<br> To the islands in the ocean,<br> To the water-cliffs and grottoes;<br> Found the maiden sweetly sleeping,<br> In her silver-tinselled raiment,<br> Girdled with a belt of copper,<br> In a nameless meadow, sleeping,<br> In the honey-fields of magic;<br> By her side were honeyed grasses,<br> By her lips were fragrant flowers,<br> Silver stalks with golden petals;<br> Dipped its winglets in the honey,<br> Dipped its fingers in the juices<br> Of the sweetest of the flowers,<br> Brought the honey back to Kapo,<br> To the mystic maiden's fingers.</p> 
<p>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<br> Placed the honey in the liquor;<br> Kapo mixed the beer and honey,<br> And the wedding-beer fermented;<br> Rose the live beer upward, upward,<br> From the bottom of the vessels,<br> Upward in the tubs of birch-wood,<br> Foaming higher, higher, higher,<br> Till it touched the oaken handles,<br> Overflowing all the caldrons;<br> To the ground it foamed and sparkled,<br> Sank away in sand and gravel.</p> 
<p>"Time had gone but little distance,<br> Scarce a moment had passed over,<br> Ere the heroes came in numbers<br> To the foaming beer of Northland,<br> Rushed to drink the sparkling liquor.<br> Ere all others Lemminkainen<br> Drank, and grew intoxicated<br> On the beer of Osmo's daughter,<br> On the honey-drink of Kalew.</p> 
<p>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<br> Kapo, brewer of the barley,<br> Spake these words in saddened accents:<br> 'Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<br> Badly have I brewed the liquor,<br> Have not brewed the beer in wisdom,<br> Will not live within its vessels,<br> Overflows and fills Pohyola!'</p> 
<p>"From a tree-top sings the redbreast,<br> From the aspen calls the robin:<br> 'Do not grieve, thy beer is worthy,<br> Put it into oaken vessels,<br> Into strong and willing barrels<br> Firmly bound with hoops of copper.'</p> 
<p>"Thus was brewed the beer or Northland,<br> At the hands of Osmo's daughter;<br> This the origin of brewing<br> Beer from Kalew-hops and barley;<br> Great indeed the reputation<br> Of the ancient beer of Kalew,<br> Said to make the feeble hardy,<br> Famed to dry the tears of women,<br> Famed to cheer the broken-hearted,<br> Make the aged young and supple,<br> Make the timid brave and mighty,<br> Make the brave men ever braver,<br> Fill the heart with joy and gladness,<br> Fill the mind with wisdom-sayings,<br> Fill the tongue with ancient legends,<br> Only makes the fool more foolish."</p> 
<p>When the hostess of Pohyola<br> Heard how beer was first fermented,<br> Heard the origin of brewing,<br> Straightway did she fill with water<br> Many oaken tubs and barrels;<br> Filled but half the largest vessels,<br> Mixed the barley with the water,<br> Added also hops abundant;<br> Well she mixed the triple forces<br> In her tubs of oak and birch-wood,<br> Heated stones for months succeeding,<br> Thus to boil the magic mixture,<br> Steeped it through the days of summer,<br> Burned the wood of many forests,<br> Emptied all the, springs of Pohya;<br> Daily did the, forests lesson,<br> And the wells gave up their waters,<br> Thus to aid the hostess, Louhi,<br> In the brewing of the liquors,<br> From the water, hops, and barley,<br> And from honey of the islands,<br> For the wedding-feast of Northland,<br> For Pohyola's great carousal<br> And rejoicings at the marriage<br> Of the Malden of the Rainbow<br> To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Metal-worker of Wainola.</p> 
<p>Smoke is seen upon the island,<br> Fire, upon the promontory,<br> Black smoke rising to the heavens<br> From the fire upon the island;<br> Fills with clouds the half of Pohya,<br> Fills Karelen's many hamlets;<br> All the people look and wonder,<br> This the chorus of the women:<br> "Whence are rising all these smoke-clouds,<br> Why this dreadful fire in Northland?<br> Is not like the smoke of camp-fires,<br> Is too large for fires of shepherds!"</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen's ancient mother<br> Journeyed in the early morning<br> For some water to the fountain,<br> Saw the smoke arise to heaven,<br> In the region of Pohyola,<br> These the words the mother uttered:<br> "'Tis the smoke of battle-heroes,<br> From the beat of warring armies!"</p> 
<p>Even Ahti, island-hero,<br> Ancient wizard, Lemminkainen,<br> Also known as Kaukomieli,<br> Looked upon the scene in wonder,<br> Thought awhile and spake as follows:<br> "I would like to see this nearer,<br> Learn the cause of all this trouble,<br> Whence this smoke and great confusion,<br> Whether smoke from heat of battle,<br> Or the bonfires of the shepherds."</p> 
<p>Kaukomieli gazed and pondered,<br> Studied long the rising smoke-clouds;<br> Came not from the heat of battle,<br> Came not from the shepherd bonfires;<br> Heard they were the fires of Louhi<br> Brewing beer in Sariola,<br> On Pohyola's promontory;<br> Long and oft looked Lemminkainen,<br> Strained in eagerness his vision,<br> Stared, and peered, and thought, and wondered,<br> Looked abashed and envy-swollen,<br> "O beloved, second mother,<br> Northland's well-intentioned hostess,<br> Brew thy beer of honey-flavor,<br> Make thy liquors foam and sparkle,<br> For thy many friends invited,<br> Brew it well for Lemminkainen,<br> For his marriage in Pohyola<br> With the Maiden of the Rainbow."</p> 
<p>Finally the beer was ready,<br> Beverage of noble heroes,<br> Stored away in casks and barrels,<br> There to rest awhile in silence,<br> In the cellars of the Northland,<br> In the copper-banded vessels,<br> In the magic oaken hogsheads,<br> Plugs and faucets made of copper.<br> Then the hostess of Pohyola<br> Skilfully prepared the dishes,<br> Laid them all with careful fingers<br> In the boiling-pans and kettles,<br> Ordered countless loaves of barley,<br> Ordered many liquid dishes,<br> All the delicacies of Northland,<br> For the feasting of her people,<br> For their richest entertainment,<br> For the nuptial songs and dances,<br> At the marriage of her daughter<br> With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen.</p> 
<p>When the loaves were baked and ready.<br> When the dishes all were seasoned,<br> Time had gone but little distance,<br> Scarce a moment had passed over,<br> Ere the beer, in casks imprisoned,<br> Loudly rapped, and sang, and murmured:<br> "Come, ye heroes, come and take me,<br> Come and let me cheer your spirits,<br> Make you sing the songs of wisdom,<br> That with honor ye may praise me,<br> Sing the songs of beer immortal!"</p> 
<p>Straightway Louhi sought a minstrel,<br> Magic bard and artist-singer,<br> That the beer might well be lauded,<br> Might be praised in song and honor.<br> First as bard they brought a salmon,<br> Also brought a pike from ocean,<br> But the salmon had no talent,<br> And the pike had little wisdom;<br> Teeth of pike and gills of salmon<br> Were not made for singing legends.</p> 
<p>Then again they sought a singer,<br> Magic minstrel, beer-enchanter,<br> Thus to praise the drink of heroes,<br> Sing the songs of joy and gladness;<br> And a boy was brought for singing;<br> But the boy had little knowledge,<br> Could not praise the beer in honor;<br> Children's tongues are filled with questions,<br> Children cannot speak in wisdom,<br> Cannot sing the ancient legends.</p> 
<p>Stronger grew the beer imprisoned<br> In the copper-banded vessels,<br> Locked behind the copper faucets,<br> Boiled, and foamed, and sang, and murmured:<br> "If ye do not bring a singer,<br> That will sing my worth immortal,<br> That will sing my praise deserving,<br> I will burst these bands of copper,<br> Burst the heads of all these barrels;<br> Will not serve the best of heroes<br> Till he sings my many virtues."</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Called a trusted maiden-servant,<br> Sent her to invite the people<br> To the marriage of her daughter,<br> These the words that Louhi uttered:<br> "O my trusted, truthful maiden,<br> Servant-maid to me belonging,<br> Call together all my people,<br> Call the heroes to my banquet,<br> Ask the rich, and ask the needy,<br> Ask the blind and deaf, and crippled,<br> Ask the young, and ask the aged;<br> Go thou to the hills, and hedges,<br> To the highways, and the by-ways,<br> Urge them to my daughter's wedding;<br> Bring the blind, and sorely troubled,<br> In my boats upon the waters,<br> In my sledges bring the halting,<br> With the old, and sick, and needy;<br> Ask the whole of Sariola,<br> Ask the people of Karelen,<br> Ask the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Famous bard and wisdom-singer;<br> But I give command explicit<br> Not to ask wild Lemminkainen,<br> Not the island-dweller, Ahti!"<br> This the question of the servant:<br> "Why not ask wild Lemminkainen,<br> Ancient islander and minstrel?"</p> 
<p>Louhi gave this simple answer:<br> "Good the reasons that I give thee<br> Why the wizard, Lemminkainen,<br> Must not have an invitation<br> To my daughter's feast and marriage<br> Ahti courts the heat of battle,<br> Lemminkainen fosters trouble,<br> Skilful fighter of the virtues;<br> Evil thinking, acting evil,<br> He would bring but pain and sorrow,<br> He would jest and jeer at maidens<br> In their trimly buckled raiment,<br> Cannot ask the evil-minded!"<br> Thus again the servant questions:<br> "Tell me how to know this Ahti,<br> Also known as Lemminkainen,<br> That I may not ask him hither;<br> Do not know the isle of Ahti,<br> Nor the home of Kaukomieli<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Easy 'tis to know the wizard,<br> Easy find the Ahti-dwelling:<br> Ahti lives on yonder island,<br> On that point dwells Lemminkainen,<br> In his mansion near the water,<br> Far at sea his home and dwelling."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the trusted maiden<br> Spread the wedding-invitations<br> To the people of Pohyola,<br> To the tribes of Kalevala;<br> Asked the friendless, asked the homeless<br> Asked the laborers and shepherds,<br> Asked the fishermen and hunters,<br> Asked the deaf, the dumb, the crippled,<br> Asked the young, and asked the aged,<br> Asked the rich, and asked the needy;<br> Did not give an invitation<br> To the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Island-dweller of the ocean.</p>
