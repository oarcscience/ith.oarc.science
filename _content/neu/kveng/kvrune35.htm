<p>KULLERWOINEN, youthful wizard,<br> In his blue and scarlet stockings,<br> Henceforth lingered with his parents;<br> But he could not change his nature,<br> Could not gain a higher wisdom,<br> Could not win a better judgment;<br> As a child he was ill-nurtured,<br> Early rocked in stupid cradles,<br> By a nurse of many follies,<br> By a minister of evil.</p> 
<p>To his work went Kullerwoinen,<br> Strove to make his labors worthy;<br> First, Kullervo went a-fishing,<br> Set his fishing-nets in ocean;<br> With his hands upon the row-locks,<br> Kullerwoinen spake as follows:<br> "Shall I pull with all my forces,<br> Pull with strength of youthful heroes,<br> Or with weakness of the aged?"</p> 
<p>From the stern arose a gray-beard,<br> And he answered thus Kullervo:<br> "Pull with all thy youthful vigor;<br> Shouldst thou row with magic power,<br> Thou couldst not destroy this vessel,<br> Couldst not row this boat to fragments."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<br> Rowed with all his youthful vigor,<br> With the mighty force of magic,<br> Rowed the bindings from the vessel,<br> Ribs of juniper he shattered,<br> Rowed the aspen-oars to pieces.</p> 
<p>When the aged sire, Kalervo,<br> Saw the work of Kullerwoinen,<br> He addressed his son as follows:<br> "Dost not understand the rowing;<br> Thou hast burst the bands asunder,<br> Bands of juniper and willow,<br> Rowed my aspen-boat to pieces;<br> To the fish-nets drive the salmon,<br> This, perchance, will suit thee better."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the son, Kullervo,<br> Hastened to his work as bidden,<br> Drove the salmon to the fish-nets,<br> Spake in innocence as follows:<br> "Shall I with my youthful vigor<br> Scare the salmon to the fish-nets,<br> Or with little magic vigor<br> Shall I drive them to their capture?<br> Spake the master of the fish-nets:<br> "That would be but work of women,<br> Shouldst thou use but little power<br> In the frighting of the salmon!"</p> 
<p>Kullerwoinen does as bidden,<br> Scares the salmon with the forces<br> Of his mighty arms and shoulders,<br> With the strength of youth and magic,<br> Stirs the water thick with black-earth,<br> Beats the scare-net into pieces,<br> Into pulp he beats the salmon.</p> 
<p>When the aged sire, Kalervo,<br> Saw the work of Kullerwoinen,<br> To his son these words he uttered:<br> "Dost not understand this labor,<br> For this work thou art not suited,<br> Canst not scare the perch and salmon<br> To the fish-nets of thy father;<br> Thou hast ruined all my fish-nets,<br> Torn my scare-net into tatters,<br> Beaten into pulp the whiting,<br> Torn my net-props into fragments,<br> Beaten into bits my wedges.<br> Leave the fishing to another;<br> See if thou canst pay the tribute,<br> Pay my yearly contribution;<br> See if thou canst better travel,<br> On the way show better judgment!"</p> 
<p>Thereupon the son, Kullervo,<br> Hapless youth in purple vestments,<br> In his magic shoes of deer-skin,<br> In his locks of golden color,<br> Sallied forth to pay the taxes,<br> Pay the tribute for his people.<br> When the youth had paid the tribute,<br> Paid the yearly contribution,<br> He returned to join the snow-sledge,<br> Took his place upon the cross-bench,<br> Snapped his whip above the courser,<br> And began his journey homeward;<br> Rattled on along the highway,<br> Measured as he galloped onward<br> Wainamoinen's hills and valleys,<br> And his fields in cultivation.</p> 
<p>Came a golden maid to meet him,<br> On her snow-shoes came a virgin,<br> O'er the hills of Wainamoinen,<br> O'er his cultivated lowlands.</p> 
<p>Quick the wizard-son, Kullervo,<br> Checked the motion of his racer,<br> Thus addressed the charming maiden<br> "Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,<br> In my fur-robes rest and linger!"<br> As she ran, the maiden answered:<br> "Let the Death-maid sit beside thee,<br> Rest and linger in thy fur-robes!"</p> 
<p>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<br> Snapped his whip above the courser;<br> Fleet as wind he gallops homeward,<br> Dashes down along the highway;<br> With the roar of falling waters,<br> Gallops onward, onward, onward,<br> O'er the broad-back of the ocean,<br> O'er the icy plains of Lapland.</p> 
<p>Comes a winsome maid to meet him,<br> Golden-haired, and wearing snow-shoes,<br> On the far outstretching ice-plains;<br> Quick the wizard checks his racer,<br> Charmingly accosts the maiden,<br> Chanting carefully these measures:<br> "Come, thou beauty, to my snow-sledge,<br> Hither come, and rest, and linger!<br> Tauntingly the maiden answered:<br> "Take Tuoni to thy snow-sledge,<br> At thy side let Manalainen<br> Sit with thee, and rest, and linger!"</p> 
<p>Quick the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<br> Struck his fiery, prancing racer,<br> With the birch-whip of his father.<br> Like the lightning flew the fleet-foot,<br> Galloped on the highway homeward;<br> O'er the hills the snow-sledge bounded,<br> And the coming mountains trembled.<br> Kullerwoinen, wild magician,<br> Measures, on his journey homeward,<br> Northland's far-extending borders,<br> And the fertile plains of Pohya.<br> Comes a beauteous maid to meet him,<br> With a tin-pin on her bosom,<br> On the heather of Pohyola,<br> O'er the Pohya-hills and moorlands.</p> 
<p>Quick the wizard son, Kullervo,<br> Holds the bridle of his courser,<br> Charmingly intones these measures:<br> "Come, fair maiden, to my snow-sledge,<br> In these fur-robes rest, and linger;<br> Eat with me the golden apples,<br> Eat the hazel-nut in joyance,<br> Drink with me the beer delicious,<br> Eat the dainties that I give thee."</p> 
<p>This the answer of the maiden<br> With the tin-pin on her bosom:<br> "I have scorn to give thy snow-sledge,<br> Scorn for thee, thou wicked wizard;<br> Cold is it beneath thy fur-robes,<br> And thy sledge is chill and cheerless.</p> 
<p>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<br> Wicked wizard of the Northland,<br> Drew the maiden to his snow-sledge,<br> Drew her to a seat beside him,<br> Quickly in his furs enwrapped her;<br> And the tin-adorned made answer,<br> These the accents of the maiden:<br> "Loose me from thy magic power,<br> Let me leave at once thy presence,<br> Lest I speak in wicked accents,<br> Lest I say the prayer of evil;<br> Free me now as I command thee,<br> Or I'll tear thy sledge to pieces,<br> Throw these fur-robes to the north-winds."</p> 
<p>Straightway wicked Kullerwoinen,<br> Evil wizard and magician,<br> Opens all his treasure-boxes,<br> Shows the maiden gold and silver,<br> Shows her silken wraps of beauty,<br> Silken hose with golden borders,<br> Golden belts with silver buckles,<br> Jewelry that dims the vision,<br> Blunts the conscience of the virgin.<br> Silver leads one to destruction,<br> Gold entices from uprightness.<br> Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,<br> Flatters lovingly the maiden,<br> One hand on the reins of leather,<br> One upon the maiden's shoulder;<br> Thus they journey through the evening,<br> Pass the night in merry-making.</p> 
<p>When the day-star led the morning,<br> When the second day was dawning,<br> Then the maid addressed Kullervo,<br> Questioned thus the wicked wizard:<br> "Of what tribe art thou descended,<br> Of what race thy hero-father?<br> Tell thy lineage and kindred.`<br> This, Kullervo's truthful answer:<br> "Am not from a mighty nation,<br> Not the greatest, nor the smallest,<br> But my lineage is worthy:<br> Am Kalervo's son of folly,<br> Am a child of contradictions,<br> Hapless son of cold misfortune.<br> Tell me of thy race of heroes,<br> Tell thine origin and kindred."<br> This the answer of the maiden:<br> "Came not from a race primeval,<br> Not the largest, nor the smallest,<br> But my lineage is worthy;<br> Am Kalervo's wretched daughter,<br> Am his long-lost child of error,<br> Am a maid of contradictions,<br> Hapless daughter of misfortune.</p> 
<p>"When a child I lived in plenty<br> In the dwellings of my mother;<br> To the woods I went for berries,<br> Went for raspberries to uplands,<br> Gathered strawberries on mountains,<br> Gathered one day then a second;<br> But, alas! upon the third day,<br> Could not find the pathway homeward,<br> Forestward the highways led me,<br> All the footpaths, to the woodlands.<br> Long I sat in bitter weeping,<br> Wept one day and then a second,<br> Wept the third from morn till even.<br> Then I climbed a. lofty mountain,<br> There I called in wailing accents,<br> And the woodlands gave this answer,<br> Thus the distant hills re-echoed:<br> 'Call no longer, foolish virgin,<br> All thy calls and tears are useless;<br> There is none to give thee answer,<br> Far away, thy home and people.'</p> 
<p>"On the third and on the fourth days,<br> On the fifth, and sixth, and seventh,<br> Constantly I sought to perish;<br> But in vain were all my efforts,<br> Could not die upon the mountains.<br> If this wretched maid had perished,<br> In the summer of the third year,<br> She had fed earth's vegetation,<br> She had blossomed as a flower,<br> Knowing neither pain nor sorrow."</p> 
<p>Scarcely had the maiden spoken,<br> When she bounded from the snow-sledge,<br> Rushed upon the rolling river,<br> To the cataract's commotion,<br> To the fiery stream and whirlpool.<br> Thus Kullervo's lovely sister<br> Hastened to her own destruction,<br> To her death by fire and water,<br> Found her peace in Tuonela,<br> In the sacred stream of Mana.</p> 
<p>Then the wicked Kullerwoinen<br> Fell to weeping, sorely troubled,<br> Wailed, and wept, and heavy-hearted,<br> Spake these words in bitter sorrow:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br> I have slain my virgin-sister,<br> Shamed the daughter of my mother;<br> Woe to thee, my ancient father!<br> Woe to thee, my gray-haired mother!<br> Wherefore was I born and nurtured,<br> Why this hapless child's existence?<br> Better fate to Kullerwoinen,<br> Had he never seen the daylight,<br> Or, if born, had never thriven<br> In these mournful days of evil!<br> Death has failed to do his duty,<br> Sickness sinned in passing by me,<br> Should have slain me in the cradle,<br> When the seventh day had ended!"</p> 
<p>Thereupon he slips the collar<br> Of his prancing royal racer,<br> Mounts the silver-headed fleet-foot,<br> Gallops like the lightning homeward;<br> Gallops only for a moment,<br> When he halts his foaming courser<br> At the cabin of his father.<br> In the court-yard stood the mother,<br> Thus the wicked son addressed her:<br> "Faithful mother, fond and tender,<br> Hadst thou slain me when an infant,<br> Smoked my life out in the chamber,<br> In a winding-sheet hadst thrown me<br> To the cataract and whirlpool,<br> In the fire hadst set my cradle,<br> After seven nights had ended,<br> Worthy would have been thy service.<br> Had the village-maidens asked thee:<br> 'Where is now the little cradle,<br> Wherefore is the bath-room empty?'<br> This had been a worthy answer:<br> 'I have burned the wizard's cradle,<br> Cast the infant to the fire-dogs;<br> In the bath-room corn is sprouting,<br> From the barley malt is brewing.'"</p> 
<p>Thereupon the aged mother<br> Asks her wizard-son these questions:<br> "What has happened to my hero,<br> What new fate has overcome thee?<br> Comest thou as from Tuoni,<br> From the castles of Manala?"<br> This, Kullervo's frank confession:<br> "Infamous the tale I bring thee,<br> My confession is dishonor:<br> On the way I met a maiden,<br> Met thy long-lost, wayward daughter,<br> Did not recognize my sister,<br> Fatal was the sin committed!<br> When the taxes had been settled,<br> When the tribute had been gathered,<br> Came a matchless maid to meet me,<br> Whom I witless led to sorrow,<br> This my mother's long-lost daughter.<br> When she saw in me her brother,<br> Quick she bounded from the snow-sledge,<br> Hastened to the roaring waters,<br> To the cataract's commotion,<br> To the fiery stream and whirlpool,<br> Hastened to her full destruction.</p> 
<p>"Now, alas! must I determine,<br> Now must find a spot befitting,<br> Where thy sinful son may perish;<br> Tell me, all-forgiving mother,<br> Where to end my life of trouble;<br> Let me stop the black-wolf's howling,<br> Let me satisfy the hunger<br> Of the vicious bear of Northland;<br> Let the shark or hungry sea-dog<br> Be my dwelling-place hereafter!"<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "Do not go to stop the howling<br> Of the hungry wolf of Northland;<br> Do not haste to still the black-bear<br> Growling in his forest-cavern;<br> Let not shark, nor vicious sea-dog<br> Be thy dwelling-place hereafter.<br> Spacious are the rooms of Suomi,<br> Limitless the Sawa-borders,<br> Large enough to hide transgression,<br> Man's misdeeds to hide for ages,<br> With his sins and evil actions.<br> Six long years man's sins lie hidden<br> In the border-land of Kalma,<br> Even nine for magic heroes,<br> Till the years bring consolation,<br> Till they quiet all his mourning."</p> 
<p>Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,<br> Answers thus his grieving mother:<br> "I can never hide from sorrow,<br> Cannot flee from my misconduct;<br> To the jaws of death I hasten,<br> To the open courts of Kalma,<br> To the hunting-grounds of Pohya,<br> To the battle-fields of heroes.<br> Untamoinen still is living,<br> Unmolested roams the wicked,<br> Unavenged my father's grievance,<br> Unavenged my mother's tortures,<br> Unavenged the wrongs I suffer!"</p>
