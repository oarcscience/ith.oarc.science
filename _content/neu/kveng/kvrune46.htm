<p>CAME the tidings to Pohyola,<br> To the village of the Northland,<br> That Wainola had recovered<br> From her troubles and misfortunes,<br> From her sicknesses and sorrows.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Toothless dame of Sariola,<br> Envy-laden, spake these measures:<br> "Know I other means of trouble,<br> I have many more resources;<br> I will drive the bear before me,<br> From the heather and the mountain,<br> Drive him from the fen and forest,<br> Drive great Otso from the glen-wood<br> On the cattle of Wainola,<br> On the flocks of Kalevala."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the Northland hostess<br> Drove the hungry bear of Pohya<br> From his cavern to the meadows,<br> To Wainola's plains and pastures.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> To his brother spake as follows:<br> "O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Forge a spear from magic metals,<br> Forge a lancet triple-pointed,<br> Forge the handle out of copper,<br> That I may destroy great Otso,<br> Slay the mighty bear of Northland,<br> That he may not eat my horses,<br> Nor destroy my herds of cattle,<br> Nor the flocks upon my pastures."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the skillful blacksmith<br> Forged a spear from magic metals,<br> Forged a lancet triple-pointed,<br> Not the longest, nor the shortest,<br> Forged the spear in wondrous beauty.<br> On one side a bear was sitting,<br> Sat a wolf upon the other,<br> On the blade an elk lay sleeping,<br> On the shaft a colt was running,<br> Near the hilt a roebuck bounding.</p> 
<p>Snows had fallen from the heavens,<br> Made the flocks as white as ermine<br> Or the hare, in days of winter,<br> And the minstrel sang these measures:<br> "My desire impels me onward<br> To the Metsola-dominions,<br> To the homes of forest-maidens,<br> To the courts of the white virgins;<br> I will hasten to the forest,<br> Labor with the woodland-forces.</p> 
<p>"Ruler of the Tapio-forests,<br> Make of me a conquering hero,<br> Help me clear these boundless woodlands.<br> O Mielikki, forest-hostess,<br> Tapio's wife, thou fair Tellervo,<br> Call thy dogs and well enchain them,<br> Set in readiness thy hunters,<br> Let them wait within their kennels.</p> 
<p>"Otso, thou O Forest-apple,<br> Bear of honey-paws and fur-robes,<br> Learn that Wainamoinen follows,<br> That the singer comes to meet thee;<br> Hide thy claws within thy mittens,<br> Let thy teeth remain in darkness,<br> That they may not harm the minstrel,<br> May be powerless in battle.<br> Mighty Otso, much beloved,<br> Honey-eater of the mountains,<br> Settle on the rocks in slumber,<br> On the turf and in thy caverns;<br> Let the aspen wave above thee,<br> Let the merry birch-tree rustle<br> O'er thy head for thy protection.<br> Rest in peace, thou much-loved Otso,<br> Turn about within thy thickets,<br> Like the partridge at her brooding,<br> In the spring-time like the wild-goose."</p> 
<p>When the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Heard his dog bark in the forest,<br> Heard his hunter's call and echo,<br> He addressed the words that follow:<br> "Thought it was the cuckoo calling,<br> Thought the pretty bird was singing;<br> It was not the sacred cuckoo,<br> Not the liquid notes of songsters,<br> 'Twas my dog that called and murmured,<br> 'Twas the echo of my hunter<br> At the cavern-doors of Otso,<br> On the border of the woodlands."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Finds the mighty bear in waiting,<br> Lifts in joy the golden covers,<br> Well inspects his shining fur-robes;<br> Lifts his honey-paws in wonder,<br> Then addresses his Creator:<br> "Be thou praised, O mighty Ukko,<br> As thou givest me great Otso,<br> Givest me the Forest-apple,<br> Thanks be paid to thee unending."<br> To the bear he spake these measures:<br> "Otso, thou my well beloved,<br> Honey-eater of the woodlands,<br> Let not anger swell thy bosom;<br> I have not the force to slay thee,<br> Willingly thy life thou givest<br> As a sacrifice to Northland.<br> Thou hast from the tree descended,<br> Glided from the aspen branches,<br> Slippery the trunks in autumn,<br> In the fog-days, smooth the branches.<br> Golden friend of fen and forest,<br> In thy fur-robes rich and beauteous,<br> Pride of woodlands, famous Light-foot,<br> Leave thy cold and cheerless dwelling,<br> Leave thy home within the alders,<br> Leave thy couch among the willows,<br> Hasten in thy purple stockings,<br> Hasten from thy walks restricted,<br> Come among the haunts of heroes,<br> Join thy friends in Kalevala.<br> We shall never treat thee evil,<br> Thou shalt dwell in peace and plenty,<br> Thou shalt feed on milk and honey,<br> Honey is the food of strangers.<br> Haste away from this thy covert,<br> From the couch of the unworthy,<br> To a couch beneath the rafters<br> Of Wainola's ancient dwellings.<br> Haste thee onward o'er the snow-plain,<br> As a leaflet in the autumn;<br> Skip beneath these birchen branches,<br> As a squirrel in the summer,<br> As a cuckoo in the spring-time."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> O'er the snow-fields hastened homeward,<br> Singing o'er the hills and mountains,<br> With his guest, the ancient Otso,<br> With his friend, the, famous Light-foot,<br> With the Honey-paw of Northland.</p> 
<p>Far away was heard the singing,<br> Heard the playing of the hunter,<br> Heard the songs of Wainamoinen;<br> All the people heard and wondered,<br> Men and maidens, young and aged,<br> From their cabins spake as follows:<br> "Hear the echoes from the woodlands,<br> Hear the bugle from the forest,<br> Hear the flute-notes of the songsters,<br> Hear the pipes of forest-maidens!"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<br> Soon appears within the court-yard.<br> Rush the people from their cabins,<br> And the heroes ask these questions:<br> "Has a mine of gold been opened,<br> Hast thou found a vein of silver,<br> Precious jewels in thy pathway?<br> Does the forest yield her treasures,<br> Give to thee the Honey-eater?<br> Does the hostess of the woodlands,<br> Give to thee the lynx and adder,<br> Since thou comest home rejoicing,<br> Playing, singing, on thy snow-shoes?"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Gave this answer to his people:<br> "For his songs I caught the adder,<br> Caught the serpent for his wisdom;<br> Therefore do I come rejoicing,<br> Singing, playing, on my snow-shoes.<br> Not the mountain lynx, nor serpent,<br> Comes, however, to our dwellings;<br> The Illustrious is coming,<br> Pride and beauty of the forest,<br> 'Tis the Master comes among us,<br> Covered with his friendly fur-robe.<br> Welcome, Otso, welcome, Light-foot,<br> Welcome, Loved-one from the glenwood!<br> If the mountain guest is welcome,<br> Open wide the gates of entry;<br> If the bear is thought unworthy,<br> Bar the doors against the stranger."<br> This the answer of the tribe-folk:<br> "We salute thee, mighty Otso,<br> Honey-paw, we bid thee welcome,<br> Welcome to our courts and cabins,<br> Welcome, Light-foot, to our tables<br> Decorated for thy coming!<br> We have wished for thee for ages,<br> Waiting since the days of childhood,<br> For the notes of Tapio's bugle,<br> For the singing of the wood-nymphs,<br> For the coming of dear Otso,<br> For the forest gold and silver,<br> Waiting for the year of plenty,<br> Longing for it as for summer,<br> As the shoe waits for the snow-fields,<br> As the sledge for beaten highways,<br> As the, maiden for her suitor,<br> And the wife her husband's coming;<br> Sat at evening by the windows,<br> At the gates have, sat at morning,<br> Sat for ages at the portals,<br> Near the granaries in winter, Vanished,<br> Till the snow-fields warmed and<br> Till the sails unfurled in joyance,<br> Till the earth grew green and blossomed,<br> Thinking all the while as follows:<br> "Where is our beloved Otso,<br> Why delays our forest-treasure?<br> Has he gone to distant Ehstland,<br> To the upper glens of Suomi?"<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Whither shall I lead the stranger,<br> Whither take the golden Light-foot?<br> Shall I lead him to the garner,<br> To the house of straw conduct him?"<br> This the answer of his tribe-folk:<br> "To the dining-hall lead Otso,<br> Greatest hero of the Northland.<br> Famous Light-foot, Forest-apple,<br> Pride and glory of the woodlands,<br> Have no fear before these maidens,<br> Fear not curly-headed virgins,<br> Clad in silver-tinselled raiment<br> Maidens hasten to their chambers<br> When dear Otso joins their number,<br> When the hero comes among them."<br> This the prayer of Wainamoinen:<br> "Grant, O Ukko, peace and plenty<br> Underneath these painted rafters,<br> In this ornamented dweling;<br> Thanks be paid to gracious Ukko!"<br> Spake again the ancient minstrel:<br> "Whither shall we lead dear Otso,<br> 'Whither take the fur-clad stranger?<br> This the answer of his people:<br> "Hither let the fur-robed Light-foot<br> Be saluted on his coming;<br> Let the Honey-paw be welcomed<br> To the hearth-stone of the penthouse,<br> Welcomed to the boiling caldrons,<br> That we may admire his fur-robe,<br> May behold his cloak with joyance.<br> Have no care, thou much-loved Otso,<br> Let not anger swell thy bosom<br> As thy coat we view with pleasure;<br> We thy fur shall never injure,<br> Shall not make it into garments<br> To protect unworthy people."</p> 
<p>Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<br> Pulled the sacred robe from Otso,<br> Spread it in the open court-yard,<br> Cut the, members into fragments,<br> Laid them in the heating caldrons,<br> In the copper-bottomed vessels-<br> O'er the fire the crane was hanging,<br> On the crane were hooks of copper,<br> On the hooks the broiling-vessels<br> Filled with bear-steak for the feasting, <br> Seasoned with the salt of Dwina,<br> From the Saxon-land imported,<br> From the distant Dwina-waters,<br> From the salt-sea brought in shallops.</p> 
<p>Ready is the feast of Otso;<br> From the fire are swung the kettles<br> On the crane of polished iron;<br> In the centers of the tables<br> Is the bear displayed in dishes,<br> Golden dishes, decorated;<br> Of the fir-tree and the linden<br> Were the tables newly fashioned;<br> Drinking cups were forged from copper,<br> Knives of gold and spoons of silver;<br> Filled the vessels to their borders<br> With the choicest bits of Light-foot,<br> Fragments of the Forest-apple.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen<br> "Ancient one with bosom golden,<br> Potent voice in Tapio's councils<br> Metsola's most lovely hostess,<br> Hostess of the glen and forest,<br> Hero-son of Tapiola,<br> Stalwart youth in cap of scarlet,<br> Tapio's most beauteous virgin,<br> Fair Tellervo of the woodlands,<br> Metsola with all her people,<br> Come, and welcome, to the feasting,<br> To the marriage-feast of Otso!<br> All sufficient, the provisions,<br> Food to eat and drink abundant,<br> Plenty for the hosts assembled,<br> Plenty more to give the village."<br> This the question of the people:<br> "Tell us of the birth of Otso!<br> Was be born within a manger,<br> Was he nurtured in the bath-room<br> Was his origin ignoble?"<br> This is Wainamoinen's answer:<br> "Otso was not born a beggar,<br> Was not born among the rushes,<br> Was not cradled in a manger;<br> Honey-paw was born in ether,<br> In the regions of the Moon-land,<br> On the shoulders of Otava,<br> With the daughters of creation.</p> 
<p>"Through the ether walked a maiden,<br> On the red rims of the cloudlets,<br> On the border of the heavens,<br> In her stockings purple-tinted,<br> In her golden-colored sandals.<br> In her hand she held a wool-box,<br> With a hair-box on her shoulder;<br> Threw the wool upon the ocean,<br> And the hair upon the rivers;<br> These are rocked by winds and waters,<br> Water-currents bear them onward,<br> Bear them to the sandy sea-shore,<br> Land them near the Woods of honey,<br> On an island forest-covered.</p> 
<p>"Fair Mielikki, woodland hostess,<br> Tapio's most cunning daughter,<br> Took the fragments from the sea-side,<br> Took the white wool from the waters,<br> Sewed the hair and wool together,<br> Laid the bundle in her basket,<br> Basket made from bark of birch-wood,<br> Bound with cords the magic bundle;<br> With the chains of gold she bound it<br> To the pine-tree's topmost branches.<br> There she rocked the thing of magic,<br> Rocked to life the tender baby,<br> Mid the blossoms of the pine-tree,<br> On the fir-top set with needles;<br> Thus the young bear well was nurtured,<br> Thus was sacred Otso cradled<br> On the honey-tree of Northland,<br> In the middle of the forest.</p> 
<p>"Sacred Otso grew and flourished,<br> Quickly grew with graceful movements,<br> Short of feet, with crooked ankles,<br> Wide of mouth and broad of forehead,<br> Short his nose, his fur-robe velvet;<br> But his claws were not well fashioned,<br> Neither were his teeth implanted.<br> Fair Mielikki, forest hostess,<br> Spake these words in meditation:<br> 'Claws I should be pleased to give him,<br> And with teeth endow the wonder,<br> Would be not abuse the favor.'</p> 
<p>"Swore the bear a promise sacred,<br> On his knees before Mielikki,<br> Hostess of the glen and forest,<br> And before omniscient Ukko,<br> First and last of all creators,<br> That he would not harm the worthy,<br> Never do a deed of evil.<br> Then Mielikki, woodland hostess,<br> Wisest maid of Tapiola,<br> Sought for teeth and claws to give him,<br> From the stoutest mountain-ashes,<br> From the juniper and oak tree,<br> From the dry knots of the alder.<br> Teeth and claws of these were worthless,<br> Would not render goodly service.</p> 
<p>"Grew a fir-tree on the mountain,<br> Grew a stately pine in Northland,<br> And the fir had silver branches,<br> Bearing golden cones abundant;<br> These the sylvan maiden gathered,<br> Teeth and claws of these she fashioned<br> In the jaws and feet of Otso,<br> Set them for the best of uses.<br> Then she freed her new-made creature,<br> Let the Light-foot walk and wander,<br> Let him lumber through the marshes,<br> Let him amble through the forest,<br> Roll upon the plains and pastures;<br> Taught him how to walk a hero,<br> How to move with graceful motion,<br> How to live in ease and pleasure,<br> How to rest in full contentment,<br> In the moors and in the marshes,<br> On the borders of the woodlands;<br> How unshod to walk in summer,<br> Stockingless to run in autumn;<br> How to rest and sleep in winter<br> In the clumps of alder-bushes<br> Underneath the sheltering fir-tree,<br> Underneath the pine's protection,<br> Wrapped securely in his fur-robes,<br> With the juniper and willow.<br> This the origin of Otso,<br> Honey-eater of the Northlands,<br> Whence the sacred booty cometh.<br> Thus again the people questioned:<br> Why became the woods so gracious,<br> Why so generous and friendly?<br> Why is Tapio so humored,<br> That he gave his dearest treasure,<br> Gave to thee his Forest-apple,<br> Honey-eater of his kingdom?<br> Was he startled with thine arrows,<br> Frightened with the spear and broadsword?"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Gave this answer to the question:<br> "Filled with kindness was the forest,<br> Glen and woodland full of greetings,<br> Tapio showing greatest favor.<br> Fair Mielikki, forest hostess,<br> Metsola's bewitching daughter,<br> Beauteous woodland maid, Tellervo,<br> Gladly led me on my journey,<br> Smoothed my pathway through the glen-wood.<br> Marked the trees upon the, mountains,<br> Pointing me to Otso's caverns,<br> To the Great Bear's golden island.</p> 
<p>"When my journeyings had ended,<br> When the bear had been discovered,<br> Had no need to launch my javelins,<br> Did not need to aim the arrow;<br> Otso tumbled in his vaulting,<br> Lost his balance in his cradle,<br> In the fir-tree where he slumbered;<br> Tore his breast upon the branches,<br> Freely gave his life to others.</p> 
<p>"Mighty Otso, my beloved,<br> Thou my golden friend and hero,<br> Take thy fur-cap from thy forehead,<br> Lay aside thy teeth forever,<br> Hide thy fingers in the darkness,<br> Close thy mouth and still thine anger,<br> While thy sacred skull is breaking.</p> 
<p>"Now I take the eyes of Otso,<br> Lest he lose the sense of seeing,<br> Lest their former powers shall weaken;<br> Though I take not all his members,<br> Not alone must these be taken.</p> 
<p>"Now I take the ears of Otso,<br> Lest he lose the sense of 'hearing,<br> Lest their former powers shall weaken;<br> Though I take not all his members,<br> Not alone must these be taken.</p> 
<p>"Now I take the nose of Otso,<br> Lest he lose the sense of smelling,<br> Lest its former powers shall weaken;<br> Though I take not all his members,<br> Not alone must this be taken.</p> 
<p>"Now I take the tongue of Otso,<br> Lest he lose the sense of tasting<br> Lest its former powers shall weaken;<br> Though I take not all his members,<br> Not alone must this be taken.</p> 
<p>"Now I take the brain of Otso,<br> Lest he lose the means of thinking,<br> Lest his consciousness should fail him,<br> Lest his former instincts weaken;<br> Though I take not all his members,<br> Not alone must this be taken.</p> 
<p>"I will reckon him a hero,<br> That will count the teeth of Light-foot,<br> That will loosen Otso's fingers<br> From their settings firmly fastened."</p> 
<p>None he finds with strength sufficient<br> To perform the task demanded.<br> Therefore ancient Wainamoinen<br> Counts the teeth of sacred Otso;<br> Loosens all the claws of Light-foot,<br> With his fingers strong as copper,<br> Slips them from their firm foundations,<br> Speaking to the bear these measures:<br> "Otso, thou my Honey-eater,<br> Thou my Fur-ball of the woodlands,<br> Onward, onward, must thou journey<br> From thy low and lonely dwelling,<br> To the court-rooms of the village.<br> Go, my treasure, through the pathway<br> Near the herds of swine and cattle,<br> To the hill-tops forest covered,<br> To the high and rising mountains,<br> To the spruce-trees filled with needles,<br> To the branches of the pine-tree;<br> There remain, my Forest-apple,<br> Linger there in lasting slumber,<br> Where the silver bells are ringing,<br> To the pleasure of the shepherd."</p> 
<p>Thus beginning, and thus ending,<br> Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Hastened from his emptied tables,<br> And the children thus addressed him:<br> "Whither hast thou led thy booty,<br> Where hast left thy Forest-apple,<br> Sacred Otso of the woodlands?<br> Hast thou left him on the iceberg,<br> Buried him upon the snow-field?<br> Hast thou sunk him in the quicksand,<br> Laid him low beneath the heather?"<br> Wainamoinen spake in answer:<br> "Have not left him on the iceberg,<br> Have not buried him in snow-fields;<br> There the dogs would soon devour him,<br> Birds of prey would feast upon him;<br> Have not hidden him in Swamp-land,<br> Have not buried him in heather;<br> There the worms would live upon him,<br> Insects feed upon his body.<br> Thither I have taken Otso,<br> To the summit of the Gold-hill,<br> To the copper-bearing mountain,<br> Laid him in his silken cradle<br> In the summit of a pine-tree,<br> Where the winds and sacred branches<br> Rock him to his lasting slumber,<br> To the pleasure of the hunter,<br> To the joy of man and hero.<br> To the east his lips are pointing,<br> While his eyes are northward looking;<br> But dear Otso looks not upward,<br> For the fierceness of the storm-winds<br> Would destroy his sense of vision."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Touched again his harp of joyance,<br> Sang again his songs enchanting,<br> To the pleasure of the evening,<br> To the joy of morn arising.<br> Spake the singer of Wainola:<br> "Light for me a torch of pine-wood,<br> For the darkness is appearing,<br> That my playing may be joyous<br> And my wisdom-songs find welcome."</p> 
<p>Then the ancient sage and singer,<br> Wise and worthy Wainamoinen,<br> Sweetly sang and played, and chanted,<br> Through the long and dreary evening,<br> Ending thus his incantation:<br> "Grant, O Ukko, my Creator,<br> That the people of Wainola<br> May enjoy another banquet<br> In the company of Light-foot;<br> Grant that we may long remember<br> Kalevala's feast with Otso!</p> 
<p>"Grant, O Ukko, my Creator,<br> That the signs may guide our footsteps,<br> That the notches in the pine-tree<br> May direct my faithful people<br> To the bear-dens of the woodlands;<br> That great Tapio's sacred bugle<br> May resound through glen and forest;<br> That the wood-nymph's call may echo,<br> May be heard in field and hamlet,<br> To the joy of all that listen!<br> Let great Tapio's horn for ages<br> Ring throughout the fen and forest,<br> Through the hills and dales of Northland<br> O'er the meadows and the mountains,<br> To awaken song and gladness<br> In the forests of Wainola,<br> On the snowy plains of Suomi,<br> On the meads of Kalevala,<br> For the coming generations."</p>
