<p>ILMARINEN, hero-blacksmith,<br> The eternal metal-worker,<br> Hastens forward to the court-room<br> Of the hostess of Pohyola,<br> Of the master of the Northland,<br> Hastens through the open portals<br> Into Louhi's home and presence.<br> Servants come with silver pitchers,<br> Filled with Northland's richest brewing;<br> Honey-drink is brought and offered<br> To the blacksmith of Wainola,<br> Ilmarinen thus replying:<br> "I shall not in all my life-time<br> Taste the drink that thou hast brought me,<br> Till I see the Maid of Beauty,<br> Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow;<br> I will drink with her in gladness,<br> For whose hand I journey hither."<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Trouble does the one selected<br> Give to him that wooes and watches;<br> Not yet are her feet in sandals,<br> Thine affianced is not ready.<br> Only canst thou woo my daughter,<br> Only canst thou win the maiden,<br> When thou hast by aid of magic<br> Plowed the serpent-field of Hisi,<br> Plowed the field of hissing vipers,<br> Touching neither beam nor handles.<br> Once this field was plowed by Piru,<br> Lempo furrowed it with horses,<br> With a plowshare made of copper,<br> With a beam of flaming iron;<br> Never since has any hero<br> Brought this field to cultivation."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen of Wainola<br> Straightway hastens to the chamber<br> Of the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Speaks these words in hesitation:<br> "Thou of Night and Dawn the daughter,<br> Tell me, dost thou not remember<br> When for thee I forged the Sampo,<br> Hammered thee the lid in colors?<br> Thou didst swear by oath the strougest,<br> By the forge and by the anvil,<br> By the tongs and by the hammer,<br> In the ears of the Almighty,<br> And before omniscient Ukko,<br> Thou wouldst follow me hereafter,<br> Be my bride, my life-companion,<br> Be my honored wife forever.<br> Now thy mother is exacting,<br> Will not give to me her daughter,<br> Till by means of magic only,<br> I have plowed the field of serpents,<br> Plowed the hissing soil of Hisi."</p> 
<p>The affianced Bride of Beauty<br> Gives this answer to the suitor:<br> "O, thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal wonder-forger,<br> Forge thyself a golden plowshare,<br> Forge the beam of shining silver,<br> And of copper forge the handles;<br> Then with ease, by aid of magic,<br> Thou canst plow the field of serpents,<br> Plow the hissing soil of Hisi."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, welcome suitor,<br> Straightway builds a forge and smithy,<br> Places gold within the furnace,<br> In the forge he lays the silver,<br> Forges then a golden plowshare,<br> Forges, too, a beam of silver,<br> Forges handles out of copper,<br> Forges boots and gloves of iron,<br> Forges him a mail of metal,<br> For his limbs a safe protection,<br> Safe protection for his body.<br> Then a horse of fire selecting,<br> Harnesses the flaming stallion,<br> Goes to plow the field of serpents,<br> Plow the viper-lands of Hisi.<br> In the field were countless vipers,<br> Serpents there of every species,<br> Crawling, writhing, hissing, stinging,<br> Harmless all against the hero,<br> Thus he stills the snakes of Lempo:<br> "Vipers, ye by God created,<br> Neither best nor worst of creatures,<br> Ye whose wisdom comes from Ukko,<br> And whose venom comes from Hisi,<br> Ukko is your greater Master,<br> By His will your heads are lifted;<br> Get ye hence before my plowing,<br> Writ-he ye through the grass and stubble,<br> Crawl ye to the nearest thicket,<br> Keep your heads beneath the heather,<br> Hunt our holes to Mana's kingdom<br> If your poison-heads be lifted,<br> Then will mighty Ukko smite them<br> 'With his iron-pointed arrows,<br> With the lightning of his anger."</p> 
<p>Thus the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Safely plows the field of serpents,<br> Lifts the vipers in his plowing,<br> Buries them beneath the furrow,<br> Harmless all against his magic.<br> When the task had been completed,<br> Ilmarinen, quick returning,<br> Thus addressed Pohyola's hostess:<br> "I have plowed the field of Hisi,<br> Plowed the field of hissing serpents,<br> Stilled and banished all the vipers;<br> Give me, ancient dame, thy daughter,<br> Fairest maiden of the Northland.<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Shall not grant to thee my daughter,<br> Shall not give my lovely virgin,<br> Till Tuoni's bear is muzzled,<br> Till Manala's wolf is conquered,<br> In the forests of the Death-land,<br> In the boundaries of Mana.<br> Hundreds have been sent to hunt him,<br> So one yet has been successful,<br> All have perished in Manala."</p> 
<p>Thereupon young Ilmarinen<br> To the maiden's chamber hastens,<br> Thus addresses his affianced:<br> "Still another test demanded,<br> I must go to Tuonela,<br> Bridle there the bear of Mana,<br> Bring him from the Death-land forests,<br> From Tuoni's grove and empire!<br> This advice the maiden gives him:<br> "O thou artist, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal metal-worker,<br> Forge of steel a magic bridle,<br> On a rock beneath the water,<br> In the foaming triple currents;<br> Make the straps of steel and copper,<br> Bridle then the bear of Mana,<br> Lead him from Tuoni's forests."</p> 
<p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Forged of steel a magic bridle,<br> On a rock beneath the water,<br> In the foam of triple currents;<br> Made the straps of steel and copper,<br> Straightway went the bear to muzzle,<br> In the forests of the Death-land,<br> Spake these words in supplication:<br> "Terhenetar, ether-maiden,<br> Daughter of the fog and snow-flake,<br> Sift the fog and let it settle<br> O'er the bills and lowland thickets,<br> Where the wild-bear feeds and lingers,<br> That he may not see my coming,<br> May not hear my stealthy footsteps!"</p> 
<p>Terhenetar hears his praying,<br> Makes the fog and snow-flake settle<br> On the coverts of the wild-beasts;<br> Thus the bear he safely bridles,<br> Fetters him in chains of magic,<br> In the forests of Tuoni,<br> In the blue groves of Manala.</p> 
<p>When this task had been completed,<br> Ilmarinen, quick returning,<br> Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<br> "Give me, worthy dame, thy daughter,<br> Give me now my bride affianced,<br> I have brought the bear of Mana<br> From Tuoni's fields and forests."<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola<br> To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<br> "I will only give my daughter,<br> Give to thee the Maid of Beauty,<br> When the monster-pike thou catchest<br> In the river of Tuoni,<br> In Manala's fatal waters,<br> Using neither hooks, nor fish-nets,<br> Neither boat, nor fishing-tackle;<br> Hundreds have been sent to catch him,<br> No one yet has been successful,<br> All have perished in Manala."</p> 
<p>Much disheartened, Ilmarinen<br> Hastened to the maiden's chamber,<br> Thus addressed the rainbow-maiden:<br> "Now a third test is demanded,<br> Much more difficult than ever;<br> I must catch the pike of Mana,<br> In the river of Tuoni,<br> And without my fishing-tackle,<br> Hard the third test of the hero!<br> This advice the maiden gives him:<br> "O thou hero, Ilmarinen,<br> Never, never be discouraged:<br> In thy furnace, forge an eagle,<br> From the fire of ancient magic;<br> He will catch the pike of Mana,<br> Catch the monster-fish in safety,<br> From the death-stream of Tuoni,<br> From Manala's fatal waters."</p> 
<p>Then the suitor, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal artist-forgeman,<br> In the furnace forged an eagle<br> From the fire of ancient wisdom;<br> For this giant bird of magic<br> Forged he talons out of iron,<br> And his beak of steel and copper;<br> Seats himself upon the eagle,<br> On his back between the wing-bones,<br> Thus addresses he his creature,<br> Gives the bird of fire, this order:<br> "Mighty eagle, bird of beauty,<br> Fly thou whither I direct thee,<br> To Tuoni's coal-black river,<br> To the blue deeps of the Death-stream,<br> Seize the mighty fish of Mana,<br> Catch for me this water-monster."</p> 
<p>Swiftly flies the magic eagle,<br> Giant-bird of worth and wonder,<br> To the river of Tuoni,<br> There to catch the pike of Mana;<br> One wing brushes on the waters,<br> While the other sweeps the heavens;<br> In the ocean dips his talons,<br> Whets his beak on mountain-ledges.</p> 
<p>Safely landing, Ilmarinen,<br> The immortal artist-forger,<br> Hunts the monster of the Death-stream,<br> While the eagle hunts and fishes<br> In the waters of Manala.<br> From the river rose a monster,<br> Grasped the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Tried to drag him to his sea-cave;<br> Quick the eagle pounced upon him,<br> With his metal-beak he seized him,<br> Wrenched his head, and rent his body,<br> Hurled him back upon the bottom<br> Of the deep and fatal river,<br> Freed his master, Ilmarinen.</p> 
<p>Then arose the pike of Mana,<br> Came the water-dog in silence,<br> Of the pikes was not the largest,<br> Nor belonged he to the smallest;<br> Tongue the length of double hatchets,<br> Teeth as long as fen-rake handles,<br> Mouth as broad as triple streamlets,<br> Back as wide as seven sea-boats,<br> Tried to snap the magic blacksmith,<br> Tried to swallow Ilmarinen.<br> Swiftly swoops the mighty eagle,<br> Of the birds was not the largest,<br> Nor belonged he to the smallest;<br> Mouth as wide as seven streamlets,<br> Tongue as long as seven javelins,<br> Like five crooked scythes his talons;<br> Swoops upon the pike of Mana.<br> Quick the giant fish endangered,<br> Darts and flounders in the river,<br> Dragging down the mighty eagle,<br> Lashing up the very bottom<br> To the surface of the river;<br> When the mighty bird uprising<br> Leaves the wounded pike in water,<br> Soars aloft on worsted pinions<br> To his home in upper ether;<br> Soars awhile, and sails, and circles,<br> Circles o'er the reddened waters,<br> Swoops again on lightning-pinions,<br> Strikes with mighty force his talons<br> Into the shoulder of his victim;<br> Strikes the second of his talons<br> On the flinty mountain-ledges,<br> On the rocks with iron hardened;<br> From the cliffs rebound his talons,<br> Slip the flinty rocks o'erhanging,<br> And the monster-pike resisting<br> Dives again beneath the surface<br> To the bottom of the river,<br> From the talons of the eagle;<br> Deep, the wounds upon the body<br> Of the monster of Tuoni.<br> Still a third time soars the eagle,<br> Soars, and sails, and quickly circles,<br> Swoops again upon the monster,<br> Fire out-shooting from his pinoins,<br> Both his eyeballs flashing lightning;<br> With his beak of steel and copper<br> Grasps again the pike of Mana<br> Firmly planted are his talons<br> In the rocks and in his victim,<br> Drags the monster from the river,<br> Lifts the pike above the waters,<br> From Tuoni's coal-black river,<br> From the blue-back of Manala.</p> 
<p>Thus the third time does the eagle<br> Bring success from former failures;<br> Thus at last the eagle catches<br> Mana's pike, the worst of fishes,<br> Swiftest swimmer of the waters,<br> From the river of Tuoni;<br> None could see Manala's river,<br> For the myriad of fish-scales;<br> Hardly could one see through ether,<br> For the feathers of the eagle,<br> Relicts of the mighty contest.</p> 
<p>Then the bird of copper talons<br> Took the pike, with scales of silver,<br> To the pine-tree's topmost branches,<br> To the fir-tree plumed with needles,<br> Tore the monster-fish in pieces,<br> Ate the body of his victim,<br> Left the head for Ilmarinen.<br> Spake the blacksmith to the eagle:<br> "O thou bird of evil nature,<br> What thy thought and what thy motive?<br> Thou hast eaten what I needed,<br> Evidence of my successes;<br> Thoughtless eagle, witless instinct,<br> Thus to mar the spoils of conquest!"</p> 
<p>But the bird of metal talons<br> Hastened onward, soaring upward,<br> Rising higher into ether,<br> Rising, flying, soaring, sailing,<br> To the borders of the long-clouds,<br> Made the vault of ether tremble,<br> Split apart the dome of heaven,<br> Broke the colored bow of Ukko,<br> Tore the Moon-horns from their sockets,<br> Disappeared beyond the Sun-land,<br> To the home of the triumphant.</p> 
<p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Took the pike-head to the hostess<br> Of the ever-dismal Northland,<br> Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<br> "Let this head forever serve thee<br> As a guest-bench for thy dwelling,<br> Evidence of hero-triumphs;<br> I have caught the pike of Mana,<br> I have done as thou demandest,<br> Three my victories in Death-land,<br> Three the tests of magic heroes;<br> Wilt thou give me now thy daughter,<br> Give to me the Maid of Beauty?"<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Badly is the test accomplished,<br> Thou has torn the pike in pieces,<br> From his neck the head is severed,<br> Of his body thou hast eaten,<br> Brought to me this worthless relic!<br> These the words of Ilmarinen:<br> "When the victory is greatest,<br> Do we suffer greatest losses!<br> From the river of Tuoni,<br> From the kingdom of Manala,<br> I have brought to thee this trophy,<br> Thus the third task is completed.<br> Tell me is the maiden ready,<br> Wilt thou give the bride affianced?<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "I will give to thee my daughter,<br> Will prepare my snow-white virgin,<br> For the suitor, Ilmarinen;<br> Thou hast won the Maid of Beauty,<br> Bride is she of thine hereafter,<br> Fit companion of thy fireside,<br> Help and joy of all thy lifetime."</p> 
<p>On the floor a child was sitting,<br> And the babe this tale related.<br> "There appeared within this dwelling,<br> Came a bird within the castle,<br> From the East came flying hither,<br> From the East, a monstrous eagle,<br> One wing touched the vault of heaven,<br> While the other swept the ocean;<br> With his tail upon the waters,<br> Reached his beak beyond the cloudlets,<br> Looked about, and eager watching,<br> Flew around, and sailing, soaring,<br> Flew away to hero-castle,<br> Knocked three times with beak of copper<br> On the castle-roof of iron;<br> But the eagle could not enter.</p> 
<p>"Then the eagle, looking round him,<br> Flew again, and sailed, and circled,<br> Flew then to the mothers' castle,<br> Loudly rapped with heavy knocking<br> On the mothers' roof of copper;<br> But the eagle could not enter.</p> 
<p>"Then the eagle, looking round him,<br> Flew a third time, sailing, soaring,<br> Flew then to the virgins' castle,<br> Knocked again with beak of copper,<br> On the virgins' roof of linen,<br> Easy for him there to enter;<br> Flew upon the castle-chimney,<br> Quick descending to the chamber,<br> Pulled the clapboards from the studding,<br> Tore the linen from the rafters,<br> Perched upon the chamber-window,<br> Near the walls of many colors,<br> On the cross-bars gaily-feathered,<br> Looked upon the curly-beaded,<br> Looked upon their golden ringlets,<br> Looked upon the snow-white virgins,<br> On the purest of the maidens,<br> On the fairest of the daughters,<br> On the maid with pearly necklace,<br> On the maiden wreathed in flowers;<br> Perched awhile, and looked, admiring,<br> Swooped upon the Maid of Beauty,<br> On the purest of the virgins,<br> On the whitest, on the fairest,<br> On the stateliest and grandest,<br> Swooped upon the rainbow-daughter<br> Of the dismal Sariola;<br> Grasped her in his mighty talons,<br> Bore away the Maid of Beauty,<br> Maid of fairest form and feature,<br> Maid adorned with pearly necklace,<br> Decked in feathers iridescent,<br> Fragrant flowers upon her bosom,<br> Scarlet band around her forehead,<br> Golden rings upon her fingers,<br> Fairest maiden of the Northland."</p> 
<p>Spake the hostess of Pohyola,<br> When the babe his tale had ended:<br> "Tell me bow, my child beloved,<br> Thou hast learned about the maiden,<br> Hast obtained the information,<br> How her flaxen ringlets nestled,<br> How the maiden's silver glistened,<br> How the virgin's gold was lauded.<br> Shone the silver Sun upon thee,<br> Did the moonbeams bring this knowledge?"<br> From the floor the child made answer:<br> "Thus I gained the information,<br> Moles of good-luck led me hither,<br> To the home, of the distinguished,<br> To the guest-room of the maiden,<br> Good-name bore her worthy father,<br> He that sailed the magic vessel;<br> Better-name enjoyed the mother,<br> She that baked the bread of barley,<br> She that kneaded wheaten biscuits,<br> Fed her many guests in Northland.</p> 
<p>"Thus the information reached me,<br> Thus the distant stranger heard it,<br> Heard the virgin had arisen:<br> Once I walked within the court-yard,<br> Stepping near the virgin's chamber,<br> At an early hour of morning,<br> Ere the Sun had broken slumber<br> Whirling rose the soot in cloudlets,<br> Blackened wreaths of smoke came rising<br> From the chamber of the maiden,<br> From thy daughter's lofty chimney;<br> There the maid was busy grinding,<br> Moved the handles of the millstone<br> Making voices like the cuckoo,<br> Like the ducks the side-holes sounded,<br> And the sifter like the goldfinch,<br> Like the sea-pearls sang the grindstones.</p> 
<p>"Then a second time I wandered<br> To the border of the meadow<br> In the forest was the maiden<br> Rocking on a fragrant hillock,<br> Dyeing red in iron vessels,<br> And in copper kettles, yellow.</p> 
<p>"Then a third time did I wander<br> To the lovely maiden's window;<br> There I saw thy daughter weaving,<br> Heard the flying of her shuttle,<br> Heard the beating of her loom-lathe,<br> Heard the rattling of her treddles,<br> Heard the whirring of her yarn-reel."<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Now alas! beloved daughter,<br> I have often taught this lesson:<br> 'Do not sing among the pine-trees,<br> Do not call adown the valleys,<br> Do not hang thy head in walking,<br> Do not bare thine arms, nor shoulders,<br> Keep the secrets of thy bosom,<br> Hide thy beauty and thy power.'</p> 
<p>"This I told thee in the autumn,<br> Taught thee in the summer season,<br> Sang thee in the budding spring-time,<br> Sang thee when the snows were falling:<br> 'Let us build a place for hiding,<br> Let us build the smallest windows,<br> Where may weave my fairest daughter,<br> Where my maid may ply her shuttle,<br> Where my joy may work unnoticed<br> By the heroes of the Northland,<br> By the suitors of Wainola.'"</p> 
<p>From the floor the child made answer,<br> Fourteen days the young child numbered;<br> "Easy 'tis to hide a war-horse<br> In the Northland fields and stables;<br> Hard indeed to hide a maiden,<br> Having lovely form and features!<br> Build of stone a distant castle<br> In the middle of the ocean,<br> Keep within thy lovely maiden,<br> Train thou there thy winsome daughter,<br> Not long hidden canst thou keep her.<br> Maidens will not grow and flourish,<br> Kept apart from men and heroes,<br> Will not live without their suitors,<br> Will not thrive without their wooers;<br> Thou canst never hide a maiden,<br> Neither on the land nor water."</p> 
<p>Now the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Head down-bent and heavy-hearted,<br> Wanders to his native country,<br> To Wainola's peaceful meadows,<br> To the plains of Kalevala,<br> Chanting as he journeys homeward:<br> "I have passed the age for wooing,<br> Woe is me, rejected suitor,<br> Woe is me, a witless minstrel,<br> That I did not woo and marry,<br> When my face was young and winsome,<br> When my hand was warm and welcome!<br> Youth dethrones my age and station,<br> Wealth is nothing, wisdom worthless,<br> When a hero goes a-wooing<br> With a poor but younger brother.<br> Fatal error that a hero<br> Does not wed in early manhood,<br> In his youth does not be master<br> Of a worthy wife and household."</p> 
<p>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Sends the edict to his people:<br> "Old men must not go a-wooing,<br> Must not swim the sea of anger,<br> Must not row upon a wager,<br> Must not run a race for glory,<br> With the younger sons of Northland."</p>
