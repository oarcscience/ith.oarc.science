<p>LOUHI, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Called her many tribes together,<br> Gave the archers bows and arrows,<br> Gave her brave men spears and broadswords;<br> Fitted out her mightiest war-ship,<br> In the vessel placed her army,<br> With their swords a hundred heroes,<br> With their bows a thousand archers;<br> Quick erected masts and sail-yards,<br> On the masts her sails of linen<br> Hanging like the clouds of heaven,<br> Like the white-clouds in the ether,<br> Sailed across the seas of Pohya,<br> To re-take the wondrous Sampo<br> From the heroes of Wainola.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br> Sailed across the deep, blue waters,<br> Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<br> "O thou daring son of Lempo,<br> Best of all my friends and heroes,<br> Mount the highest of the topmasts,<br> Look before you into ether,<br> Look behind you at the heavens,<br> Well examine the horizon,<br> Whether clear or filled with trouble."</p> 
<p>Climbed the daring Lemminkainen,<br> Ever ready for a venture,<br> To the highest of the mastheads;<br> Looked he eastward, also westward,<br> Looked he northward, also southward,<br> Then addressed wise Wainamoinen.<br> "Clear the sky appears before me,<br> But behind a dark horizon;<br> In the north a cloud is rising,<br> And a longer cloud at north-west."<br> Wainamoinen thus made answer:<br> Art thou speaking truth or fiction?<br> I am fearful that the war-ships<br> Of Pohyola are pursuing;<br> Look again with keener vision."</p> 
<p>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Looked again and spake as follows:<br> "In the distance seems a forest,<br> In the south appears an island,<br> Aspen-groves with falcons laden,<br> Alders laden with the wood-grouse."<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Surely thou art speaking falsehood;<br> 'Tis no forest in the distance,<br> Neither aspen, birch, nor alders,<br> Laden with the grouse, or falcon;<br> I am fearful that Pohyola<br> Follows with her magic armies;<br> Look again with keener vision."</p> 
<p>Then the daring Lemminkainen<br> Looked the third time from the topmast,<br> Spake and these the words be uttered:<br> "From the north a boat pursues us,<br> Driven by a hundred rowers,<br> Carrying a thousand heroes!"</p> 
<p>Knew at last old Wainamoinen,<br> Knew the truth of his inquiry,<br> Thus addressed his fleeing people:<br> "Row, O blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Row, O mighty Lemminkainen,<br> Row, all ye my noble oarsmen,<br> That our boat may skim the waters,<br> May escape from our pursuers!"</p> 
<p>Rowed the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Rowed the mighty Lemminkainen,<br> With them rowed the other heroes;<br> Heavily groaned the helm of birch-wood,<br> Loudly rattled all the row-locks;<br> All the vessel shook and trembled,<br> Like a cataract it thundered<br> As it plowed the waste of waters,<br> Tossing sea-foam to the heavens.<br> Strongly rowed Wainola's forces,<br> Strongly were their arms united;<br> But the distance did not widen<br> Twixt the boat and their pursuers.</p> 
<p>Quick the hero, Wainamoinen,<br> Saw misfortune hanging over,<br> Saw destruction in the distance<br> Heavy-hearted, long reflecting,<br> Trouble-laden, spake as follows:<br> "Only is there one salvation,<br> Know one miracle for safety!"</p> 
<p>Then he grasped his box of tinder,<br> From the box he took a flint-stone,<br> Of the tinder took some fragments,<br> Cast the fragments on the waters,<br> Spake these words of master-magic.<br> "Let from these arise a mountain<br> From the bottom of the deep-sea,<br> Let a rock arise in water,<br> That the war-ship of Pohyola,<br> With her thousand men and heroes,<br> May be wrecked upon the summit,<br> By the aid of surging billows."</p> 
<p>Instantly a reef arises,<br> In the sea springs up a mountain,<br> Eastward, westward, through the waters.<br> Came the war-ship of the Northland,<br> Through the floods the boat came steering,<br> Sailed against the mountain-ledges,<br> Fastened on the rocks in water,<br> Wrecked upon the Mount of Magic.<br> In the deep-sea fell the topmasts,<br> Fell the sails upon the billows,<br> Carried by the winds and waters<br> O'er the waves of toil and trouble.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Tries to free her sinking vessel,<br> Tries to rescue from destruction;<br> But she cannot raise the war-ship,<br> Firmly fixed upon the mountain;<br> Shattered are the ribs and rudder,<br> Ruined is the ship of Pohya.</p> 
<p>Then the hostess of the Northland,<br> Much disheartened, spake as follows:<br> "Where the force, in earth or heaven,<br> That will help a soul in trouble?"</p> 
<p>Quick she changes form and feature,<br> Makes herself another body;<br> Takes five sharpened scythes of iron,<br> Also takes five goodly sickles,<br> Shapes them into eagle-talons;<br> Takes the body of the vessel,<br> Makes the frame-work of an eagle;<br> Takes the vessel's ribs and flooring<br> Makes them into wings and breastplate;<br> For the tail she shapes the rudder;<br> In the wings she plants a thousand<br> Seniors with their bows and arrows;<br> Sets a thousand magic heroes<br> In the body, armed with broadswords<br> In the tail a hundred archers,<br> With their deadly spears and cross-bows,<br> Thus the bird is hero-feathered.<br> Quick she spreads her mighty pinions,<br> Rises as a monster-eagle,<br> Flies on high, and soars, and circles<br> With one wing she sweeps the heavens,<br> While the other sweeps the waters.<br> Spake the hero's ocean-mother:<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Turn thy vision to the north-east,<br> Cast thine eyes upon the sunrise,<br> Look behind thy fleeing vessel,<br> See the eagle of misfortune!"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen turned as bidden,<br> Turned his vision to the north-east,<br> Cast his eyes upon the sunrise,<br> There beheld the Northland-hostess,<br> Wicked witch of Sariola,<br> Flying as a monster-eagle,<br> Swooping on his mighty war-ship;<br> Flies and perches on the topmast,<br> On the sail-yards firmly settles;<br> Nearly overturns the vessel<br> Of the heroes of Wainola,<br> Underneath the weight of envy.</p> 
<p>Then the hero, Ilmarinen,<br> Turned to Ukko as his refuge,<br> Thus entreated his Creator:<br> "Ukko, thou O God in heaven,<br> Thou Creator full of mercy,<br> Guard us from impending danger,<br> That thy children may not perish,<br> May not meet with fell destruction.<br> Hither bring thy magic fire-cloak,<br> That thy people, thus protected,<br> May resist Pohyola's forces,<br> Well may fight against the hostess<br> Of the dismal Sariola,<br> May not fall before her weapons,<br> May not in the deep-sea perish!"</p> 
<p>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br> Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<br> "O thou hostess of Pohyola,<br> Wilt thou now divide the Sampo,<br> On the fog-point in the water,<br> On the island forest-covered?<br> Thus the Northland hostess answered:<br> "I will not divide the Sampo,<br> Not with thee, thou evil wizard,<br> Not with wicked Wainamoinen!"</p> 
<p>Quick the mighty eagle, Louhi,<br> Swoops upon the lid in colors,<br> Grasps the Sampo in her talons;<br> But the daring Lemminkainen<br> Straightway draws his blade of battle,<br> Draws his broadsword from his girdle,<br> Cleaves the talons of the eagle,<br> One toe only is uninjured,<br> Speaks these magic words of conquest:<br> "Down, ye spears, and down, ye broadswords,<br> Down, ye thousand witless heroes,<br> Down, ye feathered hosts of Louhi!"</p> 
<p>Spake the hostess of Pohyola,<br> Calling, screeching, from the sail-yards:<br> "O thou faithless Lemminkainen,<br> Wicked wizard, Kaukomieli,<br> To deceive thy trusting mother!<br> Thou didst give to her thy promise,<br> Not to go to war for ages,<br> Not to war for sixty summers,<br> Though desire for gold impels thee,<br> Though thou wishest gold and silver!</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> Thinking he had met destruction,<br> Snatched the rudder from the waters,<br> With it smote the monster-eagle,<br> Smote the, eagle's iron talons,<br> Smote her countless feathered heroes.<br> From her breast her hosts descended,<br> Spearmen fell upon the billows,<br> From the wings descend a thousand,<br> From the tail, a hundred archers.<br> Swoops again the bird of Pohya<br> To the bottom of the vessel,<br> Like the hawk from birch or aspen,<br> Like the falcon from the linden;<br> Grasps the Sampo with one talon,<br> Drags the treasure to the waters,<br> Drops the magic lid in colors<br> From the red rim of the war-ship<br> To the bottom of the deep-sea,<br> Where the Sampo breaks in pieces,<br> Scatters through the Alue-waters,<br> In the mighty deeps for ages,<br> To increase the ocean's treasures,<br> Treasures for the hosts of Ahto.<br> Nevermore will there be wanting<br> Richness for the Ahto-nation,<br> Never while the moonlight brightens<br> On the waters of the Northland.</p> 
<p>Many fragments of the Sampo<br> Floated on the purple waters,<br> On the waters deep and boundless,<br> Rocked by winds and waves of Suomi,<br> Carried by the rolling billows<br> To the sea-sides of Wainola.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Saw the fragments of the treasure<br> Floating on the billows landward,<br> Fragments of the lid in colors,<br> Much rejoicing, spake as follows:<br> "Thence will come the sprouting seed-grain,<br> The beginning of good fortune,<br> The unending of resources,<br> From the plowing and the sowing,<br> From the glimmer of the moonlight,<br> From the splendor of the sunshine,<br> On the fertile plains of Suomi,<br> On the meads of Kalevala."</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Thus addressed old Wainamoinen:<br> "Know I other mighty measures,<br> Know I means that are efficient,<br> And against thy golden moonlight,<br> And the splendor of thy sunshine,<br> And thy plowing, and thy reaping;<br> In the rocks I'll sink the moonbeams,<br> Hide the sun within the mountain,<br> Let the frost destroy thy sowings,<br> Freeze the crops on all thy corn-fields;<br> Iron-hail I'll send from heaven,<br> On the richness of thine acres,<br> On the barley of thy planting;<br> I will drive the bear from forests,<br> Send thee Otso from the thickets,<br> That he may destroy thy cattle,<br> May annihilate thy sheep-folds,<br> May destroy thy steeds at pasture.<br> I will send thee nine diseases,<br> Each more fatal than the other,<br> That will sicken all thy people,<br> Make thy children sink and perish,<br> Nevermore to visit Northland,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers<br> On the plains of Kalevala!"<br> Thus the ancient bard made answer:<br> "Not a Laplander can banish<br> Wainamoinen and his people;<br> Never can a Turyalander<br> Drive my tribes from Kalevala;<br> God alone has power to banish,<br> God controls the fate of nations,<br> Never trusts the arms of evil,<br> Never gives His strength to others.<br> As I trust in my Creator,<br> Call upon benignant Ukko,<br> He will guard my crops from danger<br> Drive the Frost-fiend from my corn-fields,<br> Drive great Otso to his caverns.</p> 
<p>"Wicked Louhi of Pohyola,<br> Thou canst banish evil-doers,<br> In the rocks canst hide the wicked,<br> In thy mountains lock the guilty;<br> Thou canst never hide the moonlight,<br> Never bide the silver sunshine,<br> In the caverns of thy kingdom.<br> Freeze the crops of thine own planting,<br> Freeze the barley of thy sowing,<br> Send thine iron-hail from heaven<br> To destroy the Lapland corn-fields,<br> To annihilate thy people,<br> To destroy the hosts of Pohya;<br> Send great Otso from the heather,<br> Send the sharp-tooth from the forest,<br> To the fields of Sariola,<br> On the herds and flocks of Louhi!"</p> 
<p>Thus the wicked hostess answered:<br> "All my power has departed,<br> All my strength has gone to others,<br> All my hope is in the deep-sea;<br> In the waters lies my Sampo!"</p> 
<p>Then the hostess of Pohyola<br> Home departed, weeping, wailing,<br> To the land of cold and darkness;<br> Only took some worthless fragments<br> Of the Sampo to her people;<br> Carried she the lid to Pohya,<br> In the blue-sea left the handle;<br> Hence the poverty of Northland,<br> And the famines of Pohyola.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Hastened to the broad-sea's margin,<br> Stepped upon the shore in joyance;<br> Found there fragments of the Sampo,<br> Fragments of the lid in colors,<br> On the borders of the waters,<br> On the curving sands and sea-sides;<br> Gathered well the Sampo-relics<br> From the waters near the fog-point,<br> On the island forest-covered.</p> 
<p>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Spake these words in supplication:<br> "Grant, O Ukko, our Creator,<br> Grant to us, thy needful children,<br> Peace, and happiness, and plenty,<br> That our lives may be successful,<br> That our days may end in honor,<br> On the vales and hills of Suomi,<br> On the prairies of Wainola,<br> In the homes of Kalevala!</p> 
<p>"Ukko, wise and good Creator,<br> Ukko, God of love and mercy,<br> Shelter and protect thy people<br> From the evil-minded heroes,<br> From the wiles of wicked women,<br> That our country's plagues may leave us,<br> That thy faithful tribes may prosper.<br> Be our friend and strong protector,<br> Be the helper of thy children,<br> In the night a roof above them,<br> In the day a shield around them,<br> That the sunshine may not vanish,<br> That the moonlight may not lessen,<br> That the killing frosts may leave them,<br> And destructive hail pass over.<br> Build a metal wall around us,<br> From the valleys to the heavens;<br> Build of stone a mighty fortress<br> On the borders of Wainola,<br> Where thy people live and labor,<br> As their dwelling-place forever,<br> Sure protection to thy people,<br> Where the wicked may not enter,<br> Nor the thieves break through and pilfer,<br> Never while the moonlight glistens,<br> And the Sun brings golden blessings<br> To the plains of Kalevala."</p>
