<p>KULLERWOINEN, wizard-servant<br> Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Purchased slave from Untamoinen,<br> Magic son with sky-blue stockings.,<br> With a head of golden ringlets,<br> In his shoes of marten-leather,<br> Waiting little, asked the blacksmith,<br> Asked the host for work at morning,<br> In the evening asked the hostess,<br> These the words of Kullerwoinen:<br> "Give me work at early morning,<br> In the evening, occupation,<br> Labor worthy of thy servant."</p> 
<p>Then the wife of Ilmarinen,<br> Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Thinking long, and long debating,<br> How to give the youth employment,<br> How the purchased slave could labor;<br> Finally a shepherd made him,<br> Made him keeper of her pastures;<br> But the over-scornful hostess,<br> Baked a biscuit for the herdsman,<br> Baked a loaf of wondrous thickness,<br> Baked the lower-half of oat-meal,<br> And the upper-half of barley,<br> Baked a flint-stone in the centre,<br> Poured around it liquid butter,<br> Then she gave it to the shepherd,<br> Food to still the herdsman's hunger;<br> Thus she gave the youth instructions:<br> "Do not eat the bread in hunger,<br> Till the herd is in the woodlands!"</p> 
<p>Then the wife of Ilmarinen<br> Sent her cattle to the pasture,<br> Thus addressing Kullerwoinen:<br> "Drive the cows to yonder bowers,<br> To the birch-trees and the aspens,<br> That they there may feed and fatten,<br> Fill themselves with milk and butter,<br> In the open forest-pastures,<br> On the distant hills and mountains,<br> In the glens among the birch-trees,<br> In the lowlands with the aspens,<br> In the golden pine-tree forests,<br> In the thickets silver-laden.</p> 
<p>"Guard them, thou O kind Creator,<br> Shield them, omnipresent Ukko,<br> Shelter them from every danger,<br> And protect them from all evil,<br> That they may not want, nor wander<br> From the paths of peace and plenty.<br> As at home Thou didst protect them<br> In the shelters and the hurdles,<br> Guard them now beneath the heavens,<br> Shelter them in woodland pastures,<br> That the herds may live and prosper<br> To 'the joy of Northland's hostess,<br> And against the will of Lempo.</p> 
<p>"If my herdsman prove unworthy,<br> If the shepherd-maids seem evil,<br> Let the pastures be their shepherds,<br> Let the alders guard the cattle,<br> Make the birch-tree their protector,<br> Let the willow drive them homeward,<br> Ere the hostess go to seek them,<br> Ere the milkmaids wait and worry.<br> Should the birch-tree not protect them,<br> Nor the aspen lend assistance,<br> Nor the linden be their keeper,<br> Nor the willow drive them homeward,<br> Wilt thou give them better herdsmen,<br> Let Creation's beauteous daughters<br> Be their kindly shepherdesses.<br> Thou hast many lovely maidens,<br> Many hundreds that obey thee,<br> In the Ether's spacious circles,<br> Beauteous daughters of creation.</p> 
<p>"Summer-daughter, magic maiden,<br> Southern mother of the woodlands,<br> Pine-tree daughter, Kateyatar,<br> Pihlayatar, of the aspen,<br> Alder-maiden, Tapio's daughter,<br> Daughter of the glen, Millikki,<br> And the mountain-maid, Tellervo,<br> Of my herds be ye protectors,<br> Keep them from the evil-minded,<br> Keep them safe in days of summer,<br> In the times of fragrant flowers,<br> While the tender leaves are whispering,<br> While the Earth is verdure-laden.</p> 
<p>"Summer-daughter, charming maiden,<br> Southern mother of the woodlands,<br> Spread abroad thy robes of safety,<br> Spread thine apron o'er the forest,<br> Let it cover all my cattle,<br> And protect the unprotected,<br> That no evil winds may harm them,<br> May not suffer from the storm-clouds.<br> Guard my flocks from every danger,<br> Keep them from the hands of wild-beasts,<br> From the swamps with sinking pathways,<br> From the springs that bubble trouble,<br> From the swiftly running waters,<br> From the bottom of the whirlpool,<br> That they may not find misfortune,<br> May not wander to destruction,<br> In the marshes sink and perish,<br> Though against God's best intentions,<br> Though against the will of Ukko.</p> 
<p>"From a distance bring a bugle,<br> Bring a shepherd's horn from heaven,<br> Bring the honey-flute of Ukko,<br> Play the music of creation,<br> Blow the pipes of the magician,<br> Play the flowers on the highlands,<br> Charm the hills, and dales, and mount<br> Charm the borders of the forest,<br> Fill the forest-trees with honey,<br> Fill with spice the fountain-borders.</p> 
<p>"For my herds give food and shelter,<br> Feed them all on honeyed pastures,<br> Give them drink at honeyed fountains<br> Feed them on thy golden grasses,<br> On the leaves of silver saplings,<br> From the springs of life and beauty,<br> From the crystal-waters flowing,<br> From the waterfalls of Rutya,<br> From the uplands green and golden,<br> From the glens enriched in silver.<br> Dig thou also golden fountains<br> On the four sides of the willow,<br> That the cows may drink in sweetness,<br> And their udders swell with honey,<br> That their milk may flow in streamlets;<br> Let the milk be caught in vessels,<br> Let the cow's gift be not wasted,<br> Be not given to Manala.</p> 
<p>"Many are the sons of evil,<br> That to Mana take their milkings,<br> Give their milk to evil-doers,<br> Waste it in Tuoni's empire;<br> Few there are, and they the worthy,<br> That can get the milk from Mana;<br> Never did my ancient mother<br> Ask for counsel in the village,<br> Never in the courts for wisdom;<br> She obtained her milk from Mana,<br> Took the sour-milk from the dealers,<br> Sweet-milk from the greater distance,<br> From the kingdom of Manala,<br> From Tuoni's fields and pastures;<br> Brought it in the dusk of evening,<br> Through the by-ways in the darkness,<br> That the wicked should not know it,<br> That it should not find destruction.</p> 
<p>"This the language of my mother,<br> And these words I also echo:<br> Whither does the cow's gift wander,<br> Whither has the milk departed?<br> Has it gone to feed the strangers,<br> Banished to the distant village,<br> Gone to feed the hamlet-lover,<br> Or perchance to feed the forest,<br> Disappeared within the woodlands,<br> Scattered o'er the hills and mountains,<br> Mingled with the lakes and rivers?<br> It shall never go to Mana,<br> Never go to feed the stranger,<br> Never to the village-lover;<br> Neither shall it feed the forest,<br> Nor be lost upon the mountains,<br> Neither sprinkled in the woodlands,<br> Nor be mingled with the waters;<br> It is needed for our tables,<br> Worthy food for all our children.'</p> 
<p>Summer-daughter, maid of beauty,<br> Southern daughter of Creation,<br> Give Suotikki tender fodder,<br> To Watikki, give pure water,<br> To Hermikki milk abundant,<br> Fresh provisions to Tuorikki,<br> From Mairikki let the milk flow,<br> Fresh milk from my cows in plenty,<br> Coming from the tips of grasses,<br> From the tender herbs and leaflets,<br> From the meadows rich in honey,<br> From the mother of the forest,<br> From the meadows sweetly dripping,<br> From the berry-laden branches,<br> From the heath of flower-maidens,<br> From the verdure. maiden bowers,<br> From the clouds of milk-providers,<br> From the virgin of the heavens,<br> That the milk may flow abundant<br> From the cows that I have given<br> To the keeping of Kullervo.</p> 
<p>"Rise thou virgin of the valley,<br> From the springs arise in beauty,<br> Rise thou maiden of the fountain,<br> Beautiful, arise in ether,<br> Take the waters from the cloudlets,<br> And my roaming herds besprinkle,<br> That my cows may drink and flourish,<br> May be ready for the coming<br> Of the shepherdess of evening.</p> 
<p>"O Millikki, forest-hostess,<br> Mother of the herds at pasture,<br> Send the tallest of thy servants,<br> Send the best of thine assistants,<br> That my herds may well be guarded,<br> Through the pleasant days of summer,<br> Given us by our Creator.</p> 
<p>"Beauteous virgin of the woodlands,<br> Tapio's most charming daughter,<br> Fair Tellervo, forest-maiden,<br> Softly clad in silken raiment,<br> Beautiful in golden ringlets,<br> Do thou give my herds protection,<br> In the Metsola dominions,<br> On the hills of Tapiola;<br> Shield them with thy hands of beauty,<br> Stroke them gently with thy fingers,<br> Give to them a golden lustre,<br> Make them shine like fins of salmon,<br> Grow them robes as soft as ermine.</p> 
<p>"When the evening star brings darkness,<br> When appears the hour of twilight,<br> Send my lowing cattle homeward,<br> Milk within their vessels coursing,<br> Water on their backs in lakelets.<br> When the Sun has set in ocean,<br> When the evening-bird is singing,<br> Thus address my herds of cattle:</p> 
<p>"Ye that carry horns, now hasten<br> To the sheds of Ilmarinen;<br> Ye enriched in milk go homeward,<br> To the hostess now in waiting,<br> Home, the better place for sleeping,<br> Forest-beds are full of danger;<br> When the evening comes in darkness,<br> Straightway journey to the milkmaids<br> Building fires to light the pathway<br> On the turf enriched in honey,<br> In the pastures berry-laden!</p> 
<p>"Thou, O Tapio's son, Nyrikki,<br> Forest-son, enrobed in purple,<br> Cut the fir-trees on the mountains,<br> Cut the pines with cones of beauty,<br> Lay them o'er the streams for bridges,<br> Cover well the sloughs of quicksand,<br> In the swamps and in the lowlands,<br> That my herd may pass in safety,<br> On their long and dismal journey,<br> To the clouds of smoke may hasten,<br> Where the milkmaids wait their coming.<br> If the cows heed not this order,<br> Do not hasten home at evening,<br> Then, O service-berry maiden,<br> Cut a birch-rod from the glenwood,<br> From the juniper, a whip-stick,<br> Near to Tapio's spacious mansion,<br> Standing on the ash-tree mountain,<br> Drive my wayward, ]owing cattle,<br> Into Metsola's wide milk-yards,<br> When the evening-star is rising.</p> 
<p>"Thou, O Otso, forest-apple,<br> Woodland bear, with honeyed fingers,<br> Let us make a lasting treaty,<br> Make a vow for future ages,<br> That thou wilt not kill my cattle,<br> Wilt not eat my milk-providers;<br> That I will not send my hunters<br> To destroy thee and thy kindred,<br> Never in the days of summer,<br> The Creator's warmest season.</p> 
<p>"Dost thou hear the tones of cow-bells,<br> Hear the calling of the bugles,<br> Ride thyself within the meadow,<br> Sink upon the turf in slumber,<br> Bury both thine ears in clover,<br> Crouch within some alder-thicket<br> Climb between the mossy ledges,<br> Visit thou some rocky cavern,<br> Flee away to other mountains,<br> Till thou canst not hear the cow-bells,<br> Nor the calling of the herdsmen.</p> 
<p>"Listen, Otso of the woodlands,<br> Sacred bear with honeyed fingers,<br> To approach the herd of cattle<br> Thou thyself art not forbidden,<br> But thy tongue, and teeth, and fingers,<br> Must not touch my herd in summer,<br> Must not harm my harmless creatures.<br> Go around the scented meadows,<br> Amble through the milky pastures,<br> From the tones of bells and shepherds.<br> should the herd be on the mountain,<br> Go thou quickly to the marshes;<br> Should my cattle browse the lowlands,<br> Sleep thou then within the thicket;<br> Should they feed upon the uplands,<br> Thou must hasten to the valley;<br> Should the herd graze at the bottom,<br> Thou must feed upon the summit.</p> 
<p>"Wander like the golden cuckoo,<br> Like the dove of silver brightness,<br> Like a little fish in ocean;<br> Ride thy claws within thy hair-foot,<br> Shut thy wicked teeth in darkness,<br> That my herd may not be frightened,<br> May not think themselves in danger.<br> Leave my cows in peace and plenty,<br> Let them journey home in order,<br> Through the vales and mountain by-ways,<br> Over plains and through the forest,<br> Harming not my harmless creatures.</p> 
<p>"Call to mind our former pledges,<br> At the river of Tuoni,<br> Near the waterfall and whirlpool,<br> In the ears of our Creator.<br> Thrice to Otso was it granted,<br> In the circuit of the summer,<br> To approach the land of cow-bells,<br> Where the herdsmen's voices echo;<br> But to thee it was not granted,<br> Otso never had permission<br> To attempt a wicked action,<br> To begin a work of evil.<br> Should the blinding thing of malice<br> Come upon thee in thy roamings,<br> Should thy bloody teeth feel hunger,<br> Throw thy malice to the mountains,<br> And thy hunger to the pine-trees,<br> Sink thy teeth within the aspens,<br> In the dead limbs of the birches,<br> Prune the dry stalks from the willows.<br> Should thy hunger still impel thee,<br> Go thou to the berry-mountain,<br> Eat the fungus of the forest,<br> Feed thy hunger on the ant-hills,<br> Eat the red roots of the bear-tree,<br> Metsola's rich cakes of honey,<br> Not the grass my herd would feed on.<br> Or if Metsola's rich honey<br> Should ferment before the eating,<br> On the hills of golden color,<br> On the mountains filled with silver,<br> There is other food for hunger,<br> Other drink for thirsting Otso,<br> Everlasting will the food be,<br> And the drink be never wanting.</p> 
<p>"Let us now agree in honor,<br> And conclude a lasting treaty<br> That our lives may end in pleasure,<br> May be, merry in the summer,<br> Both enjoy the woods in common,<br> Though our food must be distinctive<br> Shouldst thou still desire to fight me,<br> Let our contests be in winter,<br> Let our wars be, on the snow-fields.<br> Swamps will thaw in days of summer,<br> Warm, the water in the rivers.<br> Therefore shouldst thou break this treaty,<br> Shouldst thou come where golden cattle<br> Roam these woodland hills and valleys,<br> We will slay thee with our cross-bows;<br> Should our arrow-men be absent,<br> We have here some archer-women,<br> And among them is the hostess,<br> That can use the fatal weapon,<br> That can bring thee to destruction,<br> Thus will end the days of trouble<br> That thou bringest to our people,<br> And against the will of Ukko.</p> 
<p>"Ukko, ruler in the heavens,<br> Lend an ear to my entreaty,<br> Metamorphose all my cattle,<br> Through the mighty force of magic,<br> Into stumps and stones convert them,<br> If the enemy should wander,<br> Near my herd in days of summer.</p> 
<p>"If I had been born an Otso,<br> I would never stride and amble<br> At the feet of aged women;<br> Elsewhere there are hills and valleys,<br> Farther on are honey-pastures,<br> Where the lazy bear may wander,<br> Where the indolent may linger;<br> Sneak away to yonder mountain,<br> That thy tender flesh may lessen,<br> In the blue-glen's deep recesses,<br> In the bear-dens of the forest,<br> Thou canst move through fields of acorns,<br> Through the sand and ocean-pebbles,<br> There for thee is tracked a pathway,<br> Through the woodlands on the sea-coast,<br> To the Northland's farthest limits,<br> To the dismal plains of Lapland,<br> There 'tis well for thee to lumber,<br> There to live will be a pleasure.<br> Shoeless there to walk in summer,<br> Stockingless in days of autumn,<br> On the blue-back of the mountain,<br> Through the swamps and fertile lowlands.</p> 
<p>"If thou canst not journey thither,<br> Canst not find the Lapland-highway,<br> Hasten on a little distance,<br> In the bear-path leading northward.<br> To the grove of Tuonela,<br> To the honey-plains of Kalma,<br> Swamps there are in which to wander,<br> Heaths in which to roam at pleasure,<br> There are Kiryos, there are Karyos,<br> And of beasts a countless number,<br> With their fetters strong as iron,<br> Fattening within the forest.<br> Be ye gracious, groves and mountains,<br> Full of grace, ye darksome thickets,<br> Peace and, plenty to my cattle,<br> Through the pleasant days of summer,<br> The Creator's warmest season.</p> 
<p>"Knippana, O King of forests,<br> Thou the gray-beard of the woodlands,<br> Watch thy dogs in fen and fallow,<br> Lay a sponge within one nostril,<br> And an acorn in the other,<br> That they may not scent my cattle;<br> Tie their eyes with silken fillets,<br> That they may not see my herdlings,<br> May not see my cattle grazing.</p> 
<p>"Should all this seem inefficient,<br> Drive away thy barking children,<br> Let them run to other forests,<br> Let them hunt in other marshes,<br> From these verdant strips of meadow,<br> From these far outstretching borders,<br> Hide thy dogs within thy caverns,<br> Firmly tie thy yelping children,<br> Tie them with thy golden fetters,<br> With thy chains adorned with silver,<br> That they may not do me damage,'<br> May not do a deed of mischief.<br> Should all this prove inefficient,<br> Thou, O Ukko, King of heaven.<br> Wise director, full of mercy,<br> Hear the golden words I utter,<br> Hear a voice that breathes affection,<br> From the alder make a muzzle,<br> For each dog, within the kennel;<br> Should the alder prove too feeble,<br> Cast a band of purest copper;<br> Should the copper prove a failure,<br> Forge a band of ductile iron;<br> Should the iron snap asunder,<br> In each nose a small-ring fasten,<br> Made of molten gold and silver,<br> Chain thy dogs in forest-caverns,<br> That my herd may not be injured.</p> 
<p>Then the wife of Ilmarinen,<br> Life-companion of the blacksmith,<br> Opened all her yards and stables,<br> Led her herd across the meadow,<br> Placed them in the herdman's keeping,<br> In the care of Kullerwoinen.</p>
