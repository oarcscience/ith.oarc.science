<p>THUS has Fire returned to Northland<br> But the gold Moon is not shining,<br> Neither gleams the silver sunlight<br> In the chambers of Wainola,<br> On the plains of Kalevala.<br> On the crops the white-frost settled,<br> And the cattle died of hunger,<br> Even birds grew sick and perished.<br> Men and maidens, faint and famished,<br> Perished in the cold and darkness,<br> From the absence of the sunshine,<br> From the absence of the moonlight.<br> Knew the pike his holes and hollows,<br> And the eagle knew his highway,<br> Knew the winds the times for sailing;<br> But the wise men of the Northland<br> Could not know the dawn of morning,<br> On the fog-point in the ocean,<br> On the islands forest-covered.</p> 
<p>Young and aged talked and wondered,<br> Well reflected, long debated,<br> How to live without the moonlight,<br> Live without the silver sunshine,<br> In the cold and cheerless Northland,<br> In the homes of Kalevala.<br> Long conjectured all the maidens,<br> Orphans asked the wise for counsel.</p> 
<p>Spake a maid to Ilmarinen,<br> Running to the blacksmith's furnace:<br> "Rise, O artist, from thy slumbers,<br> Hasten from thy couch unworthy;<br> Forge from gold the Moon for Northland,<br> Forge anew the Sun from silver<br> Cannot live without the moonlight,<br> Nor without the silver sunshine!"</p> 
<p>From his couch arose the artist,<br> From his couch of stone, the blacksmith,<br> And began his work of forging,<br> Forging Sun and Moon for Northland.</p> 
<p>Came the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> In the doorway sat and lingered,<br> Spake, these Words to Ilmarinen:<br> "Blacksmith, my beloved brother,<br> Thou the only metal-worker,<br> Tell me why thy magic hammer<br> Falls so heavy on thine anvil?"<br> Spake the youthful Ilmarinen:<br> "Moon of gold and Sun of silver,<br> I am forging for Wainola;<br> I shall swing them into ether,<br> Plant them in the starry heavens."<br> Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen:<br> "Senseless blacksmith of the ages,<br> Vainly dost thou swing thy hammer,<br> Vainly rings thy mighty anvil;<br> Silver will not gleam as sunshine,<br> Not of gold is born the moonlight!"</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, little heeding,<br> Ceases not to ply his hammer,<br> Sun and Moon the artist forges,<br> Wings the Moon of Magic upward,<br> Hurls it to the pine-tree branches;<br> Does not shine without her master.<br> Then the silver Sun he stations<br> In an elm-tree on the mountain.<br> From his forehead drip the sweat-drops,<br> Perspiration from his fingers,<br> Through his labors at the anvil<br> While the Sun and Moon were forging;<br> But the Sun shone not at morning<br> From his station in the elm-tree;<br> And the Moon shone not at evening<br> From the pine-tree's topmost branches.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Let the Fates be now consulted,<br> And the oracles examined;<br> Only thus may we discover<br> Where the Sun and Moon lie hidden."</p> 
<p>Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<br> Only wise and true magician,<br> Cut three chips from trunks of alder,<br> Laid the chips in magic order,<br> Touched and turned them with his fingers,<br> Spake these words of master-magic:<br> "Of my Maker seek I knowledge,<br> Ask in hope and faith the answer<br> From the great magician, Ukko:<br> Tongue of alder, tell me truly,<br> Symbol of the great Creator,<br> Where the Sun and Moon are sleeping;<br> For the Moon shines not in season,<br> Nor appears the Sun at midday,<br> From their stations in the sky-vault.<br> Speak the truth, O magic alder,<br> Speak not words of man, nor hero,<br> Hither bring but truthful measures.<br> Let us form a sacred compact:<br> If thou speakest me a falsehood,<br> I will hurl thee to Manala,<br> Let the nether fires consume thee,<br> That thine evil signs may perish."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the alder answered,<br> Spake these words of truthful import:</p> 
<p>"Verily the Sun lies hidden<br> And the golden Moon is sleeping<br> In the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> In the copper-bearing mountain."<br> These the words of Wainamoinen:<br> "I shall go at once to Northland,<br> To the cold and dark Pohyola,<br> Bring the Sun and Moon to gladden<br> All Wainola's fields and forests."</p> 
<p>Forth he hastens on his journey,<br> To the dismal Sariola,<br> To the Northland cold and dreary;<br> Travels one day, then a second,<br> So the third from morn till evening,<br> When appear the gates of Pohya,<br> With her snow-clad hills and mountains.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> At the river of Pohyola,<br> Loudly calls the ferry-maiden:<br> Bring a boat, O Pohya-daughter,<br> Bring a strong and trusty vessel,<br> Row me o'er these chilling waters,<br> O'er this rough and rapid river! "</p> 
<p>But the Ferry-maiden heard not,<br> Did not listen to his calling.<br> Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<br> Laid a pile of well-dried brush-wood,<br> Knots and needles of the fir-tree,<br> Made a fire beside the river,<br> Sent the black smoke into heaven<br> Curling to the home of Ukko.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Hastened to her chamber window,<br> Looked upon the bay and river,<br> Spake these words to her attendants:<br> "Why the fire across the river<br> Where the current meets the deep-sea,<br> Smaller than the fires of foemen,<br> Larger than the flames of hunters?"</p> 
<p>Thereupon a Pohyalander<br> Hastened from the court of Louhi<br> That the cause he might discover,'<br> Bring the sought-for information<br> To the hostess of Pohyola;<br> Saw upon the river-border<br> Some great hero from Wainola.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen saw the stranger,<br> Called again in tones of thunder:<br> "Bring a skiff; thou son of Northland,<br> For the minstrel, Wainamoinen!<br> Thus the Pohyalander answered:<br> "Here no skiffs are lying idle,<br> Row thyself across the waters,<br> Use thine arms, and feet, and fingers,<br> To propel thee o'er the river,<br> O'er the sacred stream of Pohya."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, long reflecting,<br> Bravely thus soliloquizes:<br> "I will change my form and features,<br> Will assume a second body,<br> Neither man, nor ancient minstrel,<br> Master of the Northland waters!"</p> 
<p>Then the singer, Wainamoinen,<br> Leaped, a pike, upon the waters,<br> Quickly swam the rapid river,<br> Gained the frigid Pohya-border.<br> There his native form resuming,<br> Walked he as a mighty hero,<br> On the dismal isle of Louhi,<br> Spake the wicked sons of Northland:<br> Come thou to Pohyola's court-room."</p> 
<p>To Pohyola's, court he hastened.<br> Spake again the sons of evil:<br> Come thou to the halls of Louhi!"</p> 
<p>To Pohyola's halls he hastened.<br> On the latch he laid his fingers,<br> Set his foot within the fore-hall,<br> Hastened to the inner chamber,<br> Underneath the painted rafters,<br> Where the Northland-heroes gather.<br> There he found the Pohya-masters<br> Girded with their swords of battle,<br> With their spears and battle-axes,<br> With their fatal bows and arrows,<br> For the death of Wainamoinen,<br> Ancient bard, Suwantolainen.<br> Thus they asked the hero-stranger.<br> "Magic swimmer of the Northland,<br> Son of evil, what the message<br> That thou bringest from thy people,<br> What thy mission to Pohyola?"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Thus addressed the hosts of Louhi:<br> "For the Sun I come to Northland,<br> Come to seek the Moon in Pohya;<br> Tell me where the Sun lies hidden,<br> Where the golden Moon is sleeping."<br> Spake the evil sons of Pohya:<br> "Both the Sun and Moon are hidden<br> In the rock of many colors,<br> In the copper-bearing mountain,<br> In a cavern iron-banded,<br> In the stone-berg of Pohyola,<br> Nevermore to gain their freedom,<br> Nevermore to shine in Northland!"<br> Spake the hero, Wainamoinen:<br> "If the Sun be not uncovered,<br> If the Moon leave not her dungeon,<br> I will challenge all Pohyola<br> To the test of spear or broadsword,<br> Let us now our weapons measure!"</p> 
<p>Quick the hero of Wainola<br> Drew his mighty sword of magic;<br> On its border shone the moonlight,<br> On its hilt the Sun was shining,<br> On its back, a neighing stallion,<br> On its face a cat was mewing,<br> Beautiful his magic weapon.<br> Quick the hero-swords are tested,<br> And the blades are rightly measured<br> Wainamoinen's sword is longest<br> By a single grain of barley,<br> By a blade of straw, the widest.</p> 
<p>To the court-yard rushed the heroes,<br> Hastened to the deadly combat,<br> On the plains of Sariola.<br> Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Strikes one blow, and then a second,<br> Strikes a third time, cuts and conquers.<br> As the house-maids slice the turnips,<br> As they lop the heads of cabbage,<br> As the stalks of flax are broken,<br> So the heads of Louhi's heroes<br> Fall before the magic broadsword<br> Of the ancient Wainamoinen.</p> 
<p>Then victor from Wainola,<br> Ancient bard and great magician,<br> Went to find the Sun in slumber,<br> And the golden Moon discover,<br> In, the copper-bearing Mountains,<br> In the cavern iron-banded,<br> In the stone-berg of Pohyola.</p> 
<p>He had gone but little distance,<br> When he found a sea-green island;<br> On the island stood a birch-tree,<br> Near the birch-tree stood a pillar<br> Carved in stone of many colors;<br> In the pillar, nine large portals<br> Bolted in a hundred places;<br> In the rock he found a crevice<br> Sending forth a gleam of sunlight.<br> Quick he drew his mighty broadsword,<br> From the pillar struck three colors,<br> From the magic of his weapon;<br> And the pillar fell asunder,<br> Three the number of the fragments.<br> Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br> Through the crevice looked and wondered.<br> In the center of the pillar,<br> From a scarlet-colored basin,<br> Noxious serpents beer were drinking,<br> And the adders eating spices.<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "Therefore has Pohyola's hostess<br> Little drink to give to strangers,<br> Since her beer is drank by serpents,<br> And her spices given to adders."</p> 
<p>Quick he draws his magic fire-blade,<br> Cuts the vipers green in pieces,<br> Lops the heads off all the adders,<br> Speaks these words of master-magic:<br> Thus, hereafter, let the serpent<br> Drink the famous beer of barley,<br> Feed upon the Northland-spices!"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> The eternal wizard-singer,<br> Sought to open wide the portals<br> With the hands and words of magic;<br> But his hands had lost their cunning,<br> And his magic gone to others.</p> 
<p>Thereupon the ancient minstrel<br> Quick returning, heavy-hearted,<br> To his native halls and hamlets,<br> Thus addressed his brother-heroes:<br> "Woman, he without his weapons,<br> With no implements, a weakling!<br> Sun and Moon have I discovered,<br> But I could not force the Portals<br> Leading to their rocky cavern <br> In the copper bearing mountain.<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Why was I not taken with thee<br> To become, thy war-companion?<br> Would have been of goodly service,<br> Would have drawn the bolts or broken,<br> All the portals to the cavern,<br> Where the Sun and Moon lie hidden<br> In the copper-bearing mountain!"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br> Thus replied to Lemminkainen:<br> "Empty Words will break no portals,<br> Draw no bolts of any moment;<br> Locks and bolts are never broken.<br> With the words of little wisdom!<br> Greater means than thou commandest<br> Must be used to free the sunshine,<br> Free the moonlight from her dungeon."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, not discouraged,<br> Hastened to the, forge and smithy,<br> Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br> "O thou famous metal-artist,<br> Forge for me a magic trident,<br> Forge from steel a dozen stout-rings,<br> Master-keys, a goodly number,<br> Iron bars and heavy hammers,<br> That the Sun we may uncover<br> In the copper-bearing mountain,<br> In the stone-berg of Pohyola."</p> 
<p>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal metal-worker,<br> Forged the needs of Wainamoinen,<br> Forged for him the magic trident,<br> Forged from steel a dozen stout-rings,<br> Master-keys a goodly number,<br> Iron bars and heavy hammers,<br> Not the largest, nor the smallest,<br> Forged them of the right dimensions.</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Northland's old and toothless wizard,<br> Fastened wings upon her shoulders,<br> As an eagle, sailed the heavens,<br> Over field, and fen, and forest,<br> Over Pohya's many, waters,<br> To the hamlets of Wainola,<br> To the forge of Ilmarinen.</p> 
<p>Quick the famous metal-worker<br> Went to see if winds were blowing;<br> Found the winds at peace and silent,<br> Found an eagle, sable-colored,<br> Perched upon his window-casement.<br> Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<br> "Magic bird, whom art thou seeking,<br> Why art sitting at my window?"<br> This the answer of the eagle:<br> "Art thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> The eternal iron-forger,<br> Master of the magic metals,<br> Northland's wonder-working artist?"<br> Ilmarinen gave this answer:<br> "There is nothing here of wonder,<br> Since I forged the dome of heaven,<br> Forged the earth a concave cover!"<br> Spake again the magic eagle:<br> Why this ringing of thine anvil,<br> Why this knocking of thy hammer,<br> Tell me what thy hands are forging?"<br> This the answer of the blacksmith:<br> "'Tis a collar I am forging<br> For the neck of wicked Louhi,<br> Toothless witch of Sariola,<br> Stealer of the silver sunshine,<br> Stealer of the golden moonlight;<br> With this collar I shall bind her<br> To the iron-rock of Ehstland!"</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br> Saw misfortune fast approaching,<br> Saw destruction flying over,<br> Saw the signs of bad-luck lower;<br> Quickly winged her way through ether<br> To her native halls and chambers,<br> To the darksome Sariola,<br> There unlocked the massive portals<br> Where the Sun and Moon were hidden,<br> In the rock of many colors,<br> In the cavern iron-banded,<br> In the copper-bearing mountain.</p> 
<p>Then again the wicked Louhi<br> Changed her withered form and features,<br> And became a dove of good-luck;<br> Straightway winged the starry heavens,<br> Over field, and fen, and forest,<br> To the meadows of Wainola,<br> To the plains of Kalevala,<br> To the forge of Ilmarinen.<br> This the question of the blacksmith<br> "Wherefore comest, dove of good-luck,<br> What the tidings that thou bringest?"<br> Thus the magic bird made answer:<br> "Wherefore come I to thy smithy?<br> Come to bring the joyful tidings<br> That the Sun has left his cavern,<br> Left the rock of many colors,<br> Left the stone-berg of Pohyola;<br> That the Moon no more is hidden<br> In the copper-bearing mountains,<br> In the caverns iron-banded."</p> 
<p>Straightway hastened Ilmarinen<br> To the threshold of his smithy,<br> Quickly scanned the far horizon,<br> Saw again the silver sunshine,<br> Saw once more the golden moonlight,<br> Bringing peace, and joy, and plenty,<br> To the homes of Kalevala.<br> Thereupon the blacksmith hastened<br> To his brother, Wainamoinen,<br> Spake these words to the magician:<br> "O thou ancient bard and minstrel,<br> The eternal wizard-singer<br> See, the Sun again is shining,<br> And the golden Moon is beaming<br> From their long-neglected places,<br> From their stations in the sky-vault!"</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<br> Straightway hastened to the court-yard,<br> Looked upon the far horizon,<br> Saw once more the silver sunshine,<br> Saw again the golden moonlight,<br> Bringing peace, and joy, and plenty,<br> To the people of the Northland,<br> And the minstrel spake these measures:<br> "Greetings to thee, Sun of fortune,<br> Greetings to thee, Moon of good-luck,<br> Welcome sunshine, welcome moonlight,<br> Golden is the dawn of morning!<br> Free art thou, O Sun of silver,<br> Free again, O Moon beloved,<br> As the sacred cuckoo's singing,<br> As the ring-dove's liquid cooings.</p> 
<p>"Rise, thou silver Sun, each Morning,<br> Source of light and life hereafter,<br> Bring us, daily, joyful greetings,<br> Fill our homes with peace and plenty,<br> That our sowing, fishing, hunting,<br> May be prospered by thy coming.<br> Travel on thy daily journey,<br> Let the Moon be ever with thee;<br> Glide along thy way rejoicing,<br> End thy journeyings in slumber;<br> Rest at evening in the ocean,<br> When the daily cares have ended,<br> To the good of all thy people,<br> To the pleasure Of Wainoloa,<br> To the joy of Kalevala!"</p>
