<p>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<br> Long considered, long debated,<br> How to woo and win the daughter<br> Of the hostess of Pohyola,<br> How to lead the Bride of Beauty,<br> Fairy maiden of the rainbow,<br> To the meadows of Wainola,<br> From the dismal Sariola.</p> 
<p>Now he decks his magic vessel,<br> Paints the boat in blue and scarlet,<br> Trims in gold the ship's forecastle,<br> Decks the prow in molten silver;<br> Sings his magic ship down gliding,<br> On the cylinders of fir-tree:<br> Now erects the masts of pine-wood,<br> On each mast the sails of linen,<br> Sails of blue, and white, and scarlet,<br> Woven into finest fabric.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, the magician,<br> Steps aboard his wondrous vessel,<br> Steers the bark across the waters,<br> On the blue back of the broad-sea,<br> Speaks these words in sailing northward,<br> Sailing to the dark Pohyola:<br> "Come aboard my ship, O Ukko,<br> Come with me, thou God of mercy,<br> To protect thine ancient hero,<br> To support thy trusting servant,<br> On the breasts of raging billows,<br> On the far out-stretching waters.</p> 
<p>"Rock, O winds, this wondrous vessel,<br> Causing not a single ripple;<br> Rolling waves, bear ye me northward,<br> That the oar may not be needed<br> In my journey to Pohyola,<br> O'er this mighty waste of waters."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen's beauteous sister,<br> Fair and goodly maid, Annikki,<br> Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,<br> Who awakes each morning early,<br> Rises long before the daylight,<br> Stood one morning on the sea-shore,<br> Washing in the foam her dresses,<br> Rinsing out her silken ribbons,<br> On the bridge of scarlet color,<br> On the border of the highway,<br> On a headland jutting seaward,<br> On the forest-covered island.<br> Here Annikki, looking round her,<br> Looking through the fog and ether,<br> Looking through the clouds of heaven,<br> Gazing far out on the blue-sea,<br> Sees the morning sun arising,<br> Glimmering along the billows,<br> Looks with eyes of distant vision<br> Toward the sunrise on the waters,<br> Toward the winding streams of Suomi,<br> Where the Wina-waves were flowing.</p> 
<p>There she sees, on the horizon,<br> Something darkle in the sunlight,<br> Something blue upon the billows,<br> Speaks these words in wonder guessing:<br> What is this upon the surges,<br> What this blue upon the waters,<br> What this darkling in the sunlight?<br> 'Tis perhaps a flock of wild-geese,<br> Or perchance the blue-duck flying;<br> Then upon thy wings arising,<br> Fly away to highest heaven.</p> 
<p>"Art thou then a shoal of sea-trout,<br> Or perchance a school of salmon?<br> Dive then to the deep sea-bottom,<br> In the waters swim and frolic.</p> 
<p>"Art thou then a cliff of granite,<br> Or perchance a mighty oak-tree,<br> Floating on the rough sea-billows?<br> May the floods then wash and beat thee<br> Break thee to a thousand fragments."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, sailing northward,<br> Steers his wondrous ship of magic<br> Toward the headland jutting seaward,<br> Toward the island forest-covered.</p> 
<p>Now Annikki, goodly maiden,<br> Sees it is the magic vessel<br> Of a wonderful enchanter,<br> Of a mighty bard and hero,<br> And she asks this simple question:<br> "Art thou then my father's vessel,<br> Or my brother's ship of magic?<br> Haste away then to thy harbor,<br> To thy refuge in Wainola.<br> Hast thou come a goodly distance?<br> Sail then farther on thy journey,<br> Point thy prow to other waters."</p> 
<p>It was not her father's vessel,<br> Not a sail-boat from the distance,<br> 'Twas the ship of Wainamoinen,<br> Bark of the eternal singer;<br> Sails within a hailing distance,<br> Swims still nearer o'er the waters,<br> Brings one word and takes another,<br> Brings a third of magic import.</p> 
<p>Speaks the goodly maid, Annikki,<br> Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,<br> To the sailor of the vessel:<br> "Whither sailest, Wainamoinen,<br> Whither bound, thou friend of waters,<br> Pride and joy of Kalevala?"</p> 
<p>From the vessel Wainamomen<br> Gives this answer to the maiden:<br> "I have come to catch some sea-trout,<br> Catch the young and toothsome whiting,<br> Hiding in tbese-reeds and rushes."<br> This the answer of Annikki:</p> 
<p>"Do not speak to me in falsehood,<br> Know I well the times of fishing;<br> Long ago my honored father<br> Was a fisherman in Northland,<br> Came to catch the trout and whiting,<br> Fished within these seas and rivers.<br> Very well do I remember<br> How the fisherman disposes,<br> How he rigs his fishing vessel,<br> Lines, and gaffs, and poles, and fish-nets;<br> Hast not come a-fishing hither.<br> Whither goest, Wainamoinen,<br> Whither sailest, friend of waters?<br> Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "I have come to catch some wild-geese,<br> Catch the hissing birds of Suomi,<br> In these far-extending borders,<br> In the Sachsensund dominions."<br> Good Annikki gives this answer:<br> "Know I well a truthful speaker,<br> Easily detect a falsehood;<br> Formerly my aged father<br> Often came a-hunting hither,<br> Came to hunt the hissing wild-geese,<br> Hunt the red-bill of these waters.<br> Very well do I remember<br> How the hunter rigs his vessel,<br> Bows, and arrows, knives, and quiver,<br> Dogs enchained within the vessel,<br> Pointers hunting on the sea-shore,<br> Setters seeking in the marshes,<br> Tell the truth now Wainamoinen,<br> Whither is thy vessel sailing?"<br> Spake the hero of the Northland:<br> "To the wars my ship is sailing,<br> To the bloody fields of battle,<br> Where the streams run scarlet-colored,<br> Where the paths are paved with bodies!'<br> These the words of fair Annikki:<br> "Know I well the paths to battle.<br> Formerly my aged father<br> Often sounded war's alarum,<br> Often led the hosts to conquest;<br> In each ship a hundred rowers,<br> And in arms a thousand heroes,<br> Oil the prow a thousand cross-bows,<br> Swords, and spears, and battle-axes;<br> Know I well the ship of battle.<br> Speak Do longer fruitless falsehoods,<br> Whither sailest, Wainamoinen,<br> Whither steerest, friend of waters?<br> These the words of Wainamoinen:<br> "Come, O maiden, to my vessel,<br> In my magic ship be seated,<br> Then I'll give thee truthful answer."</p> 
<p>Thus Annikki, silver-tinselled,<br> Answers ancient Wainamoinen:<br> "With the winds I'll fill thy vessel,<br> To thy bark I'll send the storm-winds<br> And capsize thy ship of magic,<br> Break in pieces its forecastle,<br> If the truth thou dost not tell me,<br> If thou dost not cease thy falsehoods,<br> If thou dost not tell me truly<br> Whither sails thy magic vessel."<br> These the words of Wainamoinen:<br> "Now I make thee truthful answer,<br> Though at first I spake deception:<br> I am sailing to the Northland<br> To the dismal Sariola,<br> Where the ogres live and flourish,<br> Where they drown the worthy heroes,<br> There to woo the Maid of Beauty<br> Sitting on the bow of heaven,<br> Woo and win the fairy virgin,<br> Bring her to my home and kindred,<br> To the firesides of Walnola."</p> 
<p>Then Aunikki, graceful maiden,<br> Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,<br> As she heard the rightful answer,<br> Knew the truth was fully spoken,<br> Straightway left her coats unbeaten,<br> Left unwashed her linen garments,<br> Left unrinsed her silks and ribbons<br> On the highway by the sea-shore,<br> On the bridge of scarlet color<br> On her arm she threw her long-robes,<br> Hastened off with speed of roebuck<br> To the shops of Ilmarinen,<br> To the iron-forger's furnace,<br> To the blacksmith's home and smithy,<br> Here she found the hero-artist,<br> Forging out a bench of iron,<br> And adorning it with silver.<br> Soot lay thick upon his forehead,<br> Soot and coal upon his shoulders.</p> 
<p>On the threshold speaks Annikki,<br> These the words his sister uses:<br> "Ilmarinen, dearest brother,<br> Thou eternal artist-forger,<br> Forge me now a loom of silver,<br> Golden rings to grace my fingers,<br> Forge me gold and silver ear-rings,<br> Six or seven golden girdles,<br> Golden crosslets for my bosom,<br> For my head forge golden trinkets,<br> And I'll tell a tale surprising,<br> Tell a story that concerns thee<br> Truthfully I'll tell the story."</p> 
<p>Then the blacksmith Ilmarinen<br> Spake and these the words he uttered:<br> "If thou'lt tell the tale sincerely,<br> I will forge the loom of silver,<br> Golden rings to grace thy fingers,<br> Forge thee gold and silver ear-rings,<br> Six or seven golden girdles,<br> Golden crosslets for thy bosom,<br> For thy head forge golden trinkets;<br> But if thou shouldst tell me falsely,<br> I shall break thy beauteous jewels,<br> Break thine ornaments in pieces,<br> Hurl them to the fire and furnace,<br> Never forge thee other trinkets."<br> This the answer of Annikki:<br> "Ancient blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Dost thou ever think to marry<br> Her already thine affianced,<br> Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,<br> Fairest virgin of the Northland,<br> Chosen bride of Sariola?<br> Shouldst thou wish the Maid of Beauty,<br> Thou must forge, and forge unceasing,<br> Hammering the days and nights through;<br> Forge the summer hoofs for horses,<br> Forge them iron hoofs for winter,<br> In the long nights forge the snow-sledge,<br> Gaily trim it in the daytime,<br> Haste thou then upon thy journey<br> To thy wooing in the Northland,<br> To the dismal Sariola;<br> Thither journeys one more clever,<br> Sails another now before thee,<br> There to woo thy bride affianced,<br> Thence to lead thy chosen virgin,<br> Woo and win the Maid of Beauty;<br> Three long years thou hast been wooing.<br> Wainamoinen now is sailing<br> On the blue back of the waters,<br> Sitting at his helm of copper;<br> On the prow are golden carvings,<br> Beautiful his boat of magic,<br> Sailing fleetly o'er the billows,<br> To the never-pleasant Northland,<br> To the dismal Sariola."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen stood in wonder,<br> Stood a statue at the story;<br> Silent grief had settled o'er him,<br> Settled o'er the iron-artist;<br> From one hand the tongs descended,<br> From the other fell the hammer,<br> As the blacksmith made this answer:<br> "Good Annikki, worthy sister,<br> I shall forge the loom of silver,<br> Golden rings to grace thy fingers,<br> Forge thee gold and silver ear-rings,<br> Six or seven golden girdles,<br> Golden crosslets for thy bosom;<br> Go and heat for me the bath-room,<br> Fill with heat the honey-chambers,<br> Lay the faggots on the fire-place,<br> Lay the smaller woods around them,<br> Pour some water through the ashes,<br> Make a soap of magic virtue,<br> Thus to cleanse my blackened visage,<br> Thus to cleanse the blacksmith's body,<br> Thus remove the soot and ashes."</p> 
<p>Then Annikki, kindly sister,<br> Quickly warmed her brother's bath-room,<br> Warmed it with the knots of fir-trees,<br> That the thunder-winds had broken;<br> Gathered pebbles from the fire-stream,<br> Threw them in the heating waters;<br> Broke the tassels from the birch-trees,<br> Steeped the foliage in honey,<br> Made a lye from milk and ashes,<br> Made of these a strong decoction,<br> Mixed it with the fat and marrow<br> Of the reindeer of the mountains,<br> Made a soap of magic virtue,<br> Thus to cleanse the iron-artist,<br> Thus to beautify the suitor,<br> Thus to make the hero worthy.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, ancient blacksmith,<br> The eternal metal-worker,<br> Forged the wishes of his sister,<br> Ornaments for fair Annikki,<br> Rings, and bracelets, pins and ear-drops,<br> Forged for her six golden girdles,<br> Forged a weaving loom of silver,<br> While the maid prepared the bath-room,<br> Set his toilet-room in order.</p> 
<p>To the maid he gave the trinkets,<br> Gave the loom of molten silver,<br> And the sister thus made answer:<br> "I have heated well thy bath-room,<br> Have thy toilet-things in order,<br> Everything as thou desirest;<br> Go prepare thyself for wooing,<br> Lave thy bead to flaxen whiteness,<br> Make thy cheeks look fresh and ruddy,<br> Lave thyself in Love's aroma,<br> That thy wooing prove successful."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, magic artist,<br> Quick repairing to his bath-room,<br> Bathed his head to flaxen whiteness,<br> Made his cheeks look fresh and ruddy,<br> Laved his eyes until they sparkled<br> Like the moonlight on the waters;<br> Wondrous were his form and features,<br> And his cheeks like ruddy berries.<br> These the words of Ilmarinen:<br> "Fair Annikki, lovely sister,<br> Bring me now my silken raiment,<br> Bring my best and richest vesture,<br> Bring me now my softest linen,<br> That my wooing prove successful."</p> 
<p>Straightway did the helpful sister<br> Bring the finest of his raiment,<br> Bring the softest of his linen,<br> Raiment fashioned by his mother;<br> Brought to him his silken stockings,<br> Brought him shoes of marten-leather,<br> Brought a vest of sky-blue color,<br> Brought him scarlet-colored trousers,<br> Brought a coat with scarlet trimming,<br> Brought a red shawl trimmed in ermine<br> Fourfold wrapped about his body;<br> Brought a fur-coat made of seal-skin,<br> Fastened with a thousand bottons,<br> And adorned with countless jewels;<br> Brought for him his magic girdle,<br> Fastened well with golden buckles,<br> That his artist-mother fashioned;<br> Brought him gloves with golden wristlets,<br> That the Laplanders had woven<br> For a head of many ringlets;<br> Brought the finest cap in Northland,<br> That his ancient father purchased<br> When he first began his wooing.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, blacksmith-artist,<br> Clad himself to look his finest,<br> When he thus addressed a servant:<br> "Hitch for me a fleet-foot racer,<br> Hitch him to my willing snow-sledge,<br> For I start upon a journey<br> To the distant shores of Pohya,<br> To the dismal Sariola."<br> Spake the servant thus in answer:<br> "Thou hast seven fleet-foot racers,<br> Munching grain within their mangers,<br> Which of these shall I make ready?"<br> Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<br> "Take the fleetest of my coursers,<br> Put the gray steed in the harness,<br> Hitch him to my sledge of magic;<br> Place six cuckoos on the break-board,<br> Seven bluebirds on the cross-bars,<br> Thus to charm the Northland maidens,<br> Thus to make them look and listen,<br> As the cuckoos call and echo.<br> Bring me too my largest bear-skin,<br> Fold it warm about the cross-bench;<br> Bring me then my marten fur-robes,<br> As a cover and protection."</p> 
<p>Straightway then the trusty servant<br> Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Put the gray steed in the harness,<br> Hitched the racer to the snow-sledge,<br> Placed six cuckoos on the break-board,<br> Seven bluebirds on the cross-bars,<br> On the front to sing and twitter;<br> Then he brought the largest bear-skin,<br> Folded it upon the cross-bench;<br> Brought the finest robes of marten,<br> Warm protection for the master.</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen, forger-artist,<br> The eternal metal-worker,<br> Earnestly entreated Ukko:<br> "Send thy snow-flakes, Ukko, father,<br> Let them gently fall from heaven,<br> Let them cover all the heather,<br> Let them hide the berry-bushes,<br> That my sledge may glide in freedom<br> O'er the hills to Sariola!"</p> 
<p>Ukko sent the snow from heaven,<br> Gently dropped the crystal snow-flakes,<br> Lending thus his kind assistance<br> To the hero, Ilmarinen,<br> On his journey to the Northland.</p> 
<p>Reins in hand, the ancient artist<br> Seats him in his metal snow-sledge,<br> And beseeches thus his Master:<br> "Good luck to my reins and traces,<br> Good luck to my shafts and runners!<br> God protect my magic snow-sledge,<br> Be my safeguard on my journey<br> To the dismal Sariola!"</p> 
<p>Now the ancient Ilmarinen<br> Draws the reins upon the racer,<br> Snaps his whip above the courser,<br> To the gray steed gives this order,<br> And the charger plunges northward:<br> "Haste away, my flaxen stallion,<br> Haste thee onward, noble white-face,<br> To the never-pleasant Pohya,<br> To the dreary Sariola!"</p> 
<p>Fast and faster flies the fleet-foot,<br> On the curving snow-capped sea-coast,<br> On the borders of the lowlands,<br> O'er the alder-hills and mountains.<br> Merrily the steed flies onward,<br> Bluebirds singing, cuckoos calling,<br> On the sea-shore looking northward,<br> Through the sand and falling snow-flakes<br> Blinding winds, and snow, and sea-foam,<br> Cloud the hero, Ilmarinen,<br> As he glides upon his journey,<br> Looking seaward for the vessel<br> Of the ancient Wainamoinen;<br> Travels one day, then a second,<br> Travels all the next day northward,<br> Till the third day Ilmarinen<br> Overtakes old Wainamoinen,<br> Rails him in his magic vessel,<br> And addresses thus the minstrel:<br> "O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Let us woo in peace the maiden,<br> Fairest daughter or the Northland,<br> Sitting on the bow of heaven,<br> Let each labor long to win her,<br> Let her wed the one she chooses,<br> Him selecting, let her follow."<br> Wainamoinen thus makes answer:<br> "I agree to thy proposal,<br> Let us woo in peace the maiden,<br> Not by force, nor faithless measures,<br> Shall we woo the Maid of Beauty,<br> Let her follow him she chooses;<br> Let the unsuccessful suitor<br> Harbor neither wrath nor envy<br> For the hero that she follows."</p> 
<p>Thus agreeing, on they journey,<br> Each according to his pleasure;<br> Fleetly does the steed fly onward,<br> Quickly flies the magic vessel,<br> Sailing on the broad-sea northward;<br> Ilmarinen's fleet-foot racer<br> Makes the hills of Northland tremble,<br> As he gallops on his journey<br> To the dismal Sariola.</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen calls the South-winds,<br> And they fly to his assistance;<br> Swiftly sails his ship of beauty,<br> Swiftly plows the rough sea-billows<br> In her pathway to Pohyola.</p> 
<p>Time had gone but little distance,<br> Scarce a moment had passed over,<br> Ere the dogs began their barking,<br> In the mansions of the Northland,<br> In the courts of Sariola,<br> Watch-dogs of the court of Louhi;<br> Never had they growled so fiercely,<br> Never had they barked so loudly,<br> Never with their tails had beaten<br> Northland into such an uproar.<br> Spake the master of Pohyola:<br> "Go and learn, my worthy daughter,<br> Why the watch-dogs have been barking,<br> Why the black-dog signals danger."<br> Quickly does the daughter answer:<br> "I am occupied, dear father,<br> I have work of more importance,<br> I must tend my flock of lambkins,<br> I must turn the nether millstone,<br> Grind to flour the grains of barley,<br> Run the grindings through the sifter,<br> Only have I time for grinding."</p> 
<p>Lowly growls the faithful watch-dog,<br> Seldom does he growl so strangely.<br> Spake the master of Pohyola:<br> "Go and learn, my trusted consort,<br> Why the Northland dogs are barking,<br> Why the black-dog signals danger."<br> Thus his aged wife makes answer;<br> "Have no time, nor inclination,<br> I must feed my hungry household,<br> Must prepare a worthy dinner,<br> I must bake the toothsome biscuit,<br> Knead the dough till it is ready,<br> Only have I strength for kneading."<br> Spake the master of Pohyola:<br> "Dames are always in a hurry,<br> Maidens too are ever busy,<br> Whether warming at the oven,<br> Or asleep upon their couches;<br> Go my son, and learn the danger,<br> Why the black-dog growls displeasure,"<br> Quickly does the son give answer:<br> "Have no time, nor inclination,<br> Am in haste to grind my hatchet;<br> I must chop this log to cordwood,<br> For the fire must cut the faggots,<br> I must split the wood in fragments,<br> Large the pile and small the fire-wood,<br> Only have I strength for chopping."</p> 
<p>Still the watch-dog growls in anger,<br> Growl the whelps within the mansion,<br> Growl the dogs chained in the kennel,<br> Growls the black-dog on the hill-top,<br> Setting Northland in an uproar.<br> Spake the master of Pohyola:<br> "Never, never does my black-dog<br> Growl like this without a reason;<br> Never does he bark for nothing,<br> Does not growl at angry billows,<br> Nor the sighing of the pine-trees."</p> 
<p>Then the master of Pohyola<br> Went himself to learn the reason<br> For the barking of the watch-dogs;<br> Strode he through the spacious court-yard,<br> Through the open fields beyond it,<br> To the summit of the uplands.<br> Looking toward his black-dog barking,<br> He beholds the muzzle pointed<br> To a distant, stormy hill-top,<br> To a mound with alders covered;<br> There he learned the rightful reason,<br> Why his dogs had barked so loudly,<br> Why had growled the wool-tail bearer,<br> Why his whelps had signalled danger.<br> At full sail, he saw a vessel,<br> And the ship was scarlet-colored,<br> Entering the bay of Lempo;<br> Saw a sledge of magic colors,<br> Gliding up the curving sea-shore,<br> O'er the snow-fields of Pohyola.</p> 
<p>Then the master of the Northland<br> Hastened straightway to his dwelling,<br> Hastened forward to his court-room,<br> These the accents of the master:<br> "Often strangers journey hither,<br> On the blue back of the ocean,<br> Sailing in a scarlet vessel,<br> Rocking in the bay of Lempo;<br> Often strangers come in sledges<br> To the honey-lands of Louhi."</p> 
<p>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> How shall we obtain a token<br> Why these strangers journey hither?<br> My beloved, faithful daughter,<br> Lay a branch upon the fire-place,<br> Let it burn with fire of magic<br> If it trickle drops of scarlet,<br> War and bloodshed do they bring us;<br> If it trickle drops of water,<br> Peace and plenty bring the strangers."</p> 
<p>Northland's fair and slender maiden,<br> Beautiful and modest daughter,<br> Lays a sorb-branch on the fire-place,<br> Lights it with the fire of magic;<br> Does not trickle drops of scarlet,<br> Trickles neither blood, nor water,<br> From the wand come drops of honey.</p> 
<p>From the corner spake Suowakko,<br> This the language of the wizard:<br> "If the wand is dripping honey,<br> Then the strangers that are coming<br> Are but worthy friends and suitors."</p> 
<p>Then the hostess of the Northland,<br> With the daughter of the hostess,<br> Straightway left their work, and hastened<br> From their dwelling to the court-yard;<br> Looked about in all directions,<br> Turned their eyes upon the waters,<br> Saw a magic-colored vessel<br> Rocking slowly in the harbor,<br> Having sailed the bay of Lempo,<br> Triple sails, and masts, and rigging,<br> Sable was the nether portion,<br> And the upper, scarlet-colored,<br> At the helm an ancient hero<br> Leaning on his oars of copper;<br> Saw a fleet-foot racer running,<br> Saw a red sledge lightly follow,<br> Saw the magic sledge emblazoned,<br> Guided toward the courts of Louhi;<br> Saw and heard six golden cuckoos<br> Sitting on the break-board, calling,<br> Seven bluebirds richly colored<br> Singing from the yoke and cross-bar;<br> In the sledge a magic hero,<br> Young, and strong, and proud, and handsome,<br> Holding reins upon the courser.<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Dearest daughter, winsome maiden,<br> Dost thou wish a noble suitor?<br> Should these heroes come to woo thee,<br> Wouldst thou leave thy home and country,<br> Be the bride of him that pleases,<br> Be his faithful life-companion?</p> 
<p>"He that comes upon the waters,<br> Sailing in a magic vessel,<br> Having sailed the bay of Lempo,<br> Is the good, old Wainamoinen;<br> In his ship are countless treasures,<br> Richest presents from Wainola.</p> 
<p>"He that rides here in his snow-sledge<br> In his sledge of magic beauty,<br> With the cuckoos and the bluebirds,<br> Is the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> Cometh hither empty-handed,<br> Only brings some wisdom-sayings.<br> When they come within the dwelling,<br> Bring a bowl of honeyed viands,<br> Bring a pitcher with two handles,<br> Give to him that thou wouldst follow<br> Give it to old Wainamoinen,<br> Him that brings thee countless treasures,<br> Costly presents in his vessel,<br> Priceless gems from Kalevala."</p> 
<p>Spake the Northland's lovely daughter,<br> This the language of the maiden<br> "Good, indeed, advice maternal,<br> But I will not wed for riches,<br> Wed no man for countless treasures;<br> For his worth I'll choose a husband,<br> For his youth and fine appearance,<br> For his noble form and features;<br> In the olden times the maidens<br> Were not sold by anxious mothers<br> To the suitors that they loved not.<br> I shall choose without his treasures<br> Ilmarinen for his wisdom,<br> For his worth and good behavior,<br> Him that forged the wondrous Sampo,<br> Hammered thee the lid in colors."<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "Senseless daughter, child of folly,<br> Thus to choose the ancient blacksmith,<br> From whose brow drips perspiration,<br> Evermore to rinse his linen,<br> Lave his hands, and eyes, and forehead,<br> Keep his ancient house in order;<br> Little use his wit and wisdom<br> When compared with gold and silver."<br> This the answer of the daughter:<br> "I will never, never, never,<br> Wed the ancient Wainamoinen<br> With his gold and priceless jewels;<br> Never will I be a helpmate<br> To a hero in his dotage,<br> Little thanks my compensation."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, safely landing<br> In advance of Ilmarinen,<br> Pulls his gaily-covered vessel<br> From the waves upon the sea-beach,<br> On the cylinders of birch-wood,<br> On the rollers copper-banded,<br> Straightway hastens to the guest-room<br> Of the hostess of Pohyola,<br> Of the master of the Northland,<br> Speaks these words upon the threshold<br> To the famous Maid of Beauty:<br> "Come with me, thou lovely virgin,<br> Be my bride and life-companion,<br> Share with me my joys and sorrows,<br> Be my honored wife hereafter!"<br> This the answer of the maiden:<br> "Hast thou built for me the vessel,<br> Built for me the ship of magic<br> From the fragments of the distaff,<br> From the splinters of the spindle?"<br> Wainamoinen thus replying:<br> "I have built the promised vessel,<br> Built the wondrous ship for sailing,<br> Firmly joined the parts by magic;<br> It will weather roughest billows,<br> Will outlive the winds and waters,<br> Swiftly glide upon the blue-back<br> Of the deep and boundless ocean<br> It will ride the waves in beauty,<br> Like an airy bubble rising,<br> Like a cork on lake and river,<br> Through the angry seas of Northland,<br> Through Pohyola's peaceful waters."</p> 
<p>Northland's fair and slender daughter<br> Gives this answer to her suitor:<br> "Will not wed a sea-born hero,<br> Do not care to rock the billows,<br> Cannot live with such a husband<br> Storms would bring us pain and trouble,<br> Winds would rack our hearts and temples;<br> Therefore thee I cannot follow,<br> Cannot keep thy home in order,<br> Cannot be thy life-companion,<br> Cannot wed old Wainamoinen."</p>
