<p>IN the ancient times a mother<br> Hatched and raised some swans and chickens,<br> Placed the chickens in the brushwood,<br> Placed her swans upon the river;<br> Came an eagle, hawk, and falcon,<br> Scattered all her swans and chickens,<br> One was carried to Karyala,<br> And a second into Ehstland,<br> Left a third at home in Pohya.<br> And the one to Ehstland taken<br> Soon became a thriving merchant;<br> He that journeyed to Karyala<br> Flourished and was called Kalervo;<br> He that hid away in Pohya<br> Took the name of Untamoinen,<br> Flourished to his father's sorrow,<br> To the heart-pain of his mother.</p> 
<p>Untamoinen sets his fish-nets<br> In the waters of Kalervo;<br> Kullerwoinen sees the fish-nets,<br> Takes the fish home in his basket.<br> Then Untamo, evil-minded,<br> Angry grew and sighed for vengeance,<br> Clutched his fingers for the combat,<br> Bared his mighty arms for battle,<br> For the stealing of his salmon,<br> For the robbing of his fish-nets.<br> Long they battled, fierce the struggle,<br> Neither one could prove the victor;<br> Should one beat the other fiercely,<br> He himself was fiercely beaten.</p> 
<p>Then arose a second trouble;<br> On the second and the third days,<br> Kalerwoinen sowed some barley<br> Near the barns of Untamoinen;<br> Untamoinen's sheep in hunger<br> Ate the crop of Kullerwoinen;<br> Kullerwoinen's dog in malice<br> Tore Untamo's sheep in pieces;<br> Then Untamo sorely threatened<br> To annihilate the people<br> Of his brother, Kalerwoinen,<br> To exterminate his tribe-folk,<br> To destroy the young and aged,<br> To out-root his race and kingdom;<br> Conjures men with broadswords girded,<br> For the war he fashions heroes,<br> Fashions youth with spears adjusted,<br> Bearing axes on their shoulders ,<br> Conjures thus a mighty army,<br> Hastens to begin a battle,<br> Bring a war upon his brother.</p> 
<p>Kalerwoinen's wife in beauty<br> Sat beside her chamber-window,<br> Looking out along the highway,<br> Spake these words in wonder guessing:<br> "Do I see some smoke arising,<br> Or perchance a heavy storm-cloud,<br> Near the border of the forest,<br> Near the ending of the prairie?"</p> 
<p>It was not some smoke arising,<br> Nor indeed a heavy storm-cloud,<br> It was Untamoinen's soldiers<br> Marching to the place of battle.<br> Warriors of Untamoinen<br> Came equipped with spears and arrows,<br> Killed the people of Kalervo,<br> Slew his tribe and all his kindred,<br> Burned to ashes many dwellings,<br> Levelled many courts and cabins,<br> Only, left Kalervo's daughter,<br> With her unborn child, survivors<br> Of the slaughter of Untamo;<br> And she led the hostile army<br> To her father's halls and mansion,<br> Swept the rooms and made them cheery,<br> Gave the heroes home-attentions.</p> 
<p>Time had gone but little distance,<br> Ere a boy was born in magic<br> Of the virgin, Untamala,<br> Of a mother, trouble-laden,<br> Him the mother named Kullervo,<br> "Pearl of Combat," said Untamo.<br> Then they laid the child of wonder,<br> Fatherless, the magic infant,<br> In the cradle of attention,<br> To be rocked, and fed, and guarded;<br> But he rocked himself at pleasure,<br> Rocked until his locks stood endwise;<br> Rocked one day, and then a second,<br> Rocked the third from morn till noontide;<br> But before the third day ended,<br> Kicks the boy with might of magic,<br> Forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards,<br> Kicks in miracles of power,<br> Bursts with might his swaddling garments<br> Creeping from beneath his blankets,<br> Knocks his cradle into fragments,<br> Tears to tatters all his raiment,<br> Seemed that he would grow a hero,<br> And his mother, Untamala,<br> Thought that be, when full of stature,<br> When he found his strength and reason,<br> Would become a great magician,<br> First among a thousand heroes.</p> 
<p>When. three months the boy had thriven,<br> He began to speak as follows:<br> "When my form is full of stature,<br> When these arms grow strong and hardy,<br> Then will I avenge the murder<br> Of Kalervo and his people!"</p> 
<p>Untamoinen bears the saying,<br> Speaks these words to those about him;<br> "To my tribe he brings destruction,<br> In him grows a new Kalervo!"</p> 
<p>Then the heroes well considered,<br> And the women gave their counsel,<br> How to kill the magic infant,<br> That their tribe may live in safety.<br> It appeared the boy would prosper;<br> Finally, they all consenting,<br> He was placed within a basket,<br> And with willows firmly fastened,<br> Taken to the reeds and rushes,<br> Lowered to the deepest waters,<br> In his basket there to perish.</p> 
<p>When three nights had circled over,<br> Messengers of Untamoinen<br> Went to see if be had perished<br> In his basket in the waters;<br> But the prodigy, was living,<br> Had not perished in the rushes;<br> He had left his willow-basket,<br> Sat in triumph on a billow,<br> In his hand a rod of copper,<br> On the rod a golden fish-line,<br> Fishing for the silver whiting,<br> Measuring the deeps beneath him;<br> In the sea was little water,<br> Scarcely would it fill three measures.</p> 
<p>Untamoinen then reflected,<br> This the language of the wizard:<br> "Whither shall we take this wonder,<br> Lay this prodigy of evil,<br> That destruction may o'ertake him,<br> Where the boy will sink and perish?"</p> 
<p>Then his messengers he ordered<br> To collect dried poles of brushwood,<br> Birch-trees with their hundred branches,<br> Pine-trees full of pitch and resin,<br> Ordered that a pyre be builded,<br> That the boy might be cremated,<br> That Kullervo thus might perish.<br> High they piled the and branches,<br> Dried limbs from the sacred birch-tree,<br> Branches from a hundred fir-trees,<br> Knots and branches full of resign;<br> Filled with bark a thousand sledges,<br> Seasoned oak, a hundred measures;<br> Piled the brushwood to the tree-tops,<br> Set the boy upon the summit,<br> Set on fire the pile of brushwood,<br> Burned one day, and then a second,<br> Burned the third from morn till evening.</p> 
<p>When Untamo sent his heralds<br> To inspect the pyre and wizard,<br> There to learn if young Kullervo<br> Had been burned to dust and ashes,<br> There they saw the young boy sitting<br> On a pyramid of embers,<br> In his band a rod of copper,<br> Raking coals of fire about him,<br> To increase their heat and power;<br> Not a hair was burned nor injured,<br> Not a ringlet singed nor shrivelled.</p> 
<p>Then Untamo, evil-humored,<br> Thus addressed his trusted heralds:<br> "Whither shall the boy be taken,<br> To what place this thing of evil,<br> That destruction may o'ertake him.<br> That the boy may sink and perish?"</p> 
<p>Then they hung him to an oak-tree,<br> Crucified him in the branches,<br> That the wizard there might perish.</p> 
<p>When three days and nights had ended,<br> Untamoinen spake as follows:<br> "It is time to send my heralds<br> To inspect the mighty oak-tree,<br> There to learn if young Kullervo<br> Lives or dies among the branches."</p> 
<p>Thereupon he sent his servants,<br> And the heralds brought this message:<br> "Young Kullervo has not perished,<br> Has not died among the branches<br> Of the oak-tree where we hung him.<br> In the oak he maketh pictures<br> With a wand between his fingers;<br> Pictures hang from all the branches,<br> Carved and painted by Kullervo;<br> And the heroes, thick as acorns,<br> With their swords and spears adjuste4<br> Fill the branches of the oak-tree,<br> Every leaf becomes a soldier."</p> 
<p>Who can help the grave Untamo<br> Kill the boy that threatens evil<br> To Untamo's tribe and country,<br> Since he will not die by water,<br> Nor by fire, nor crucifixion?<br> Finally it was decided<br> That his body was immortal,<br> Could not suffer death nor torture.</p> 
<p>In despair grave Untamoinen<br> Thus addressed the boy, Kullervo:<br> "Wilt thou live a life becoming,<br> Always do my people honor,<br> Should I keep thee in my dwelling?<br> Shouldst thou render servant's duty,<br> Then thou wilt receive thy wages,<br> Reaping whatsoe'er thou sowest;<br> Thou canst wear the golden girdle,<br> Or endure the tongue of censure."</p> 
<p>When the boy had grown a little,<br> Had increased in strength and stature,<br> He was given occupation,<br> He was made to tend an infant,<br> Made to rock the infant's cradle.<br> These the words of Untamoinen:<br> "Often look upon the young child,<br> Feed him well and guard from danger,<br> Wash his linen in the river,<br> Give the infant good attention."</p> 
<p>Young Kullervo, wicked wizard,<br> Nurses one day then a second;<br> On the morning of the third day,<br> Gives the infant cruel treatment,<br> Blinds its eyes and breaks its fingers;<br> And when evening shadows gather,<br> Kills the young child while it slumbers,<br> Throws its body to the waters,<br> Breaks and burns the infant's cradle.<br> Untamoinen thus reflected:<br> "Never will this fell Kullervo<br> Be a worthy nurse for children,<br> Cannot rock a babe in safety;<br> Do not know how I can use him,<br> What employment I can give him!"<br> Then he told the young magician<br> He must fell the standing forest,<br> And Kullervo gave this answer:<br> "Only will I be a hero,<br> When I wield the magic hatchet;<br> I am young, and fair, and mighty,<br> Far more beautiful than others,<br> Have the skill of six magicians."</p> 
<p>Thereupon he sought the blacksmith,<br> This the order of Kullervo:<br> "Listen, O thou metal-artist,<br> Forge for me an axe of copper,<br> Forge the mighty axe of heroes,<br> Wherewith I may fell the forest,<br> Fell the birch, and oak, and aspen."</p> 
<p>This behest the blacksmith honors,<br> Forges him an axe of copper,<br> Wonderful the blade he forges.<br> Kullerwoinen grinds his hatchet,<br> Grinds his blade from morn till evening,<br> And the next day makes the handle;<br> Then he hastens to the forest,<br> To the upward-sloping mountain,<br> To the tallest of the birches,<br> To the mightiest of oak-trees;<br> There he swings his axe of copper,<br> Swings his blade with might of magic,<br> Cuts with sharpened edge the aspen,<br> With one blow he fells the oak-tree,<br> With a second blow, the linden;<br> Many trees have quickly fallen,<br> By the hatchet of Kullervo.<br> Then the wizard spake as follows:<br> "This the proper work of Lempo,<br> Let dire Hisi fell the forest!"</p> 
<p>In the birch he sank his hatchet,<br> Made an uproar in the woodlands,<br> Called aloud in tones, of thunder,<br> Whistled to the distant mountains,<br> Till they echoed to his calling,<br> When Kullervo spake as follows:<br> "May the forest, in the circle<br> Where my voice rings, fall and perish,<br> In the earth be lost forever!<br> May no tree remain unlevelled,<br> May no saplings grow in spring-time,<br> Never while the moonlight glimmers,<br> Where Kullervo's voice has echoed,<br> Where the forest hears my calling;<br> Where the ground with seed is planted,<br> And the grain shall sprout and flourish,<br> May it never come to ripeness,<br> Mar the ears of corn be blasted!"</p> 
<p>When the strong man, Untamoinen,<br> Went to look at early evening,<br> How Kullervo was progressing,<br> In his labors in the forest;<br> Little was the work accomplished,<br> Was not worthy of a here;<br> Untamoinen thus reflected:<br> "Young Kullervo is not fitted<br> For the work of clearing forests,<br> Wastes the best of all the timber,<br> To my lands he brings destruction;<br> I shall set him making fences."</p> 
<p>Then the youth began the building<br> Of a fence for Untamoinen;<br> Took the trunks of stately fir-trees,<br> Trimmed them with his blade for fence-posts,<br> Cut the tallest in the woodlands,<br> For the railing of his fences;<br> Made the smaller poles and cross-bars<br> From the longest of the lindens;<br> Made the fence without a pass-way,<br> Made no wicket in his fences,<br> And Kullervo spake these measures.<br> "He that does not rise as eagles,<br> Does not sail on wings through ether,<br> Cannot cross Kullervo's pickets,<br> Nor the fences he has builded."</p> 
<p>Untamoinen left his mansion<br> To inspect the young boy's labors,<br> View the fences of Kullervo;<br> Saw the fence without a pass-way,<br> Not a wicket in his fences;<br> From the earth the fence extended<br> To the highest clouds of heaven.<br> These the words of Untamoinen:<br> "For this work be is not fitted,<br> Useless is the fence thus builded;<br> Is so high that none can cross it,<br> And there is no passage through it:<br> He shall thresh the rye and barley."</p> 
<p>Young Kullervo, quick preparing<br> Made an oaken flail for threshing,<br> Threshed the rye to finest powder,<br> Threshed the barley into atoms,<br> And the straw to worthless fragments.</p> 
<p>Untamoinen went at evening,<br> Went to see Kullervo's threshing,<br> View the work of Kullerwoinen;<br> Found the rye was ground to powder,<br> Grains of barley crushed to atoms,<br> And the straw to worthless rubbish.</p> 
<p>Untamoinen then grew angry,<br> Spake these words in bitter accents:<br> "Kullerwoinen as a workman<br> Is a miserable failure;<br> Whatsoever work he touches<br> Is but ruined by his witchcraft;<br> I shall carry him to Ehstland,<br> In Karyala I shall sell him<br> To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> There to swing the heavy hammer."</p> 
<p>Untamoinen sells Kullervo,<br> Trades him off in far Karyala,<br> To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br> To the master of the metals,<br> This the sum received in payment:<br> Seven worn and worthless sickles,<br> Three old caldrons worse than useless,<br> Three old scythes, and hoes, and axes,<br> Recompense, indeed, sufficient<br> For a boy that will not labor<br> For the good of his employer.</p>
