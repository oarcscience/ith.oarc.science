<p>AT the home of Ilmarinen<br> Long had they been watching, waiting,<br> For the coming of the blacksmith,<br> With his bride from Sariola.<br> Weary were the eyes of watchers,<br> Waiting from the father's portals,<br> Looking from the mother's windows;<br> Weary were the young knees standing<br> At the gates of the magician;<br> Weary grew the feet of children,<br> Tramping to the walls and watching;<br> Worn and torn, the shoes of heroes,<br> Running on the shore to meet him.</p> 
<p>Now at last upon a morning<br> Of a lovely day in winter,<br> Heard they from the woods the rumble<br> Of a snow-sledge swiftly bounding.<br> Lakko, hostess of Wainola,<br> She the lovely Kalew-daughter,<br> Spake these words in great excitement:<br> "'Tis the sledge of the magician,<br> Comes at last the metal-worker<br> From the dismal Sariola,<br> By his side the Bride of Beauty!<br> Welcome, welcome, to this hamlet,<br> Welcome to thy mother's hearth-stone,<br> To the dwelling of thy father,<br> By thine ancestors erected!"</p> 
<p>Straightway came great Ilmarinen<br> To his cottage drove the blacksmith,<br> To the fireside of his father,<br> To his mother's ancient dwelling.<br> Hazel-birds were sweetly singing<br> On the newly-bended collar;<br> Sweetly called the sacred cuckoos<br> From the summit of the break-board;<br> Merry, jumped the graceful squirrel<br> On the oaken shafts and cross-bar.</p> 
<p>Lakko, Kalew's fairest hostess,<br> Beauteous daughter of Wainola,<br> Spake these words of hearty welcome:<br> "For the new moon hopes the village,<br> For the sun, the happy maidens,<br> For the boat, the swelling water;<br> I have not the moon expected,<br> For the sun have not been waiting,<br> I have waited for my hero,<br> Waited for the Bride of Beauty;<br> Watched at morning, watched at evening,<br> Did not know but some misfortune,<br> Some sad fate had overtaken<br> Bride and bridegroom on their journey;<br> Thought the maiden growing weary,<br> Weary of my son's attentions,<br> Since he faithfully had promised<br> To return to Kalevala,<br> Ere his foot-prints had departed<br> From the snow-fields of his father.<br> Every morn I looked and listened,<br> Constantly I thought and wondered<br> When his sledge would rumble homeward,<br> When it would return triumphant<br> To his home, renowned and ancient.<br> Had a blind and beggared straw-horse<br> Hobbled to these shores awaiting,<br> With a sledge of but two pieces,<br> Well the steed would have been lauded,<br> Had it brought my son beloved,<br> Had it brought the Bride of Beauty.<br> Thus I waited long, impatient,<br> Looking out from morn till even,<br> Watching with my head extended,<br> With my tresses streaming southward,<br> With my eyelids widely opened,<br> Waiting for my son's returning<br> To this modest home of heroes,<br> To this narrow place of resting.<br> Finally am I rewarded,<br> For the sledge has come triumphant,<br> Bringing home my son and hero,<br> By his side the Rainbow maiden,<br> Red her cheeks, her visage winsome,<br> Pride and joy of Sariola.</p> 
<p>"Wizard-bridegroom of Wainola,<br> Take thy-courser to the stable,<br> Lead him to the well-filled manger,<br> To the best of grain and clover;<br> Give to us thy friendly greetings,<br> Greetings send to all thy people.<br> When thy greetings thou hast ended,<br> Then relate what has befallen<br> To our hero in his absence.<br> Hast thou gone without adventure<br> To the dark fields of Pohyola,<br> Searching for the Maid of Beauty?<br> Didst thou scale the hostile ramparts,<br> Didst thou take the virgin's mansion,<br> Passing o'er her mother's threshold,<br> Visiting the halls of Louhi?</p> 
<p>"But I know without the asking,<br> See the answer to my question:<br> Comest from the North a victor,<br> On thy journey well contented;<br> Thou hast brought the Northland daughter,<br> Thou hast razed the hostile portals,<br> Thou hast stormed the forts of Louhi,<br> Stormed the mighty walls opposing,<br> On thy journey to Pohyola,<br> To the village of the father.<br> In thy care the bride is sitting,<br> In thine arms, the Rainbow-maiden,<br> At thy side, the pride of Northland,<br> Mated to the highly-gifted.<br> Who has told the cruel story,<br> Who the worst of news has scattered,<br> That thy suit was unsuccessful,<br> That in vain thy steed had journeyed?<br> Not in vain has been thy wooing,<br> Not in vain thy steed has travelled<br> To the dismal homes of Lapland;<br> He has journeyed heavy laden,<br> Shaken mane, and tail, and forelock,<br> Dripping foam from lips and nostrils,<br> Through the bringing of the maiden,<br> With the burden of the husband.</p> 
<p>"Come, thou beauty, from the snow-sledge,<br> Come, descend thou from the cross-bench,<br> Do not linger for assistance,<br> Do not tarry to be carried;<br> If too young the one that lifts thee,<br> If too proud the one in waiting,<br> Rise thou, graceful, like a young bird,<br> Hither glide along the pathway,<br> On the tan-bark scarlet- colored,<br> That the herds of kine have evened,<br> That the gentle lambs have trodden,<br> Smoothened by the tails of horses.<br> Haste thou here with gentle footsteps,<br> Through the pathway smooth and tidy,<br> On the tiles of even surface,<br> On thy second father's court-yard,<br> To thy second mother's dwelling,<br> To thy brother's place of resting,<br> To thy sister's silent chambers.<br> Place thy foot within these portals,<br> Step across this waiting threshold,<br> Enter thou these halls of joyance,<br> Underneath these painted rafters,<br> Underneath this roof of ages.<br> During all the winter evenings,<br> Through the summer gone forever,<br> Sang the tiling made of ivory,<br> Wishing thou wouldst walk upon it;<br> Often sang the golden ceiling,<br> Hoping thou wouldst walk beneath it,<br> And the windows often whistled,<br> Asking thee to sit beside them;<br> Even on this merry morning,<br> Even on the recent evening,<br> Sat the aged at their windows,<br> On the sea-shore ran the children,<br> Near the walls the maidens waited,<br> Ran the boys upon the highway,<br> There to watch the young bride's coming,<br> Coming with her hero-husband.</p> 
<p>"Hail, ye courtiers of Wainola,<br> With the heroes of the fathers,<br> Hail to thee, Wainola's hamlet,<br> Hail, ye halls with heroes peopled,<br> Hail, ye rooms with all your inmates,<br> Hail to thee, sweet golden moonlight,<br> Hail to thee, benignant Ukko,<br> Hail companions of the bridegroom!<br> Never has there been in Northland<br> Such a wedding-train of honor,<br> Never such a bride of beauty.</p> 
<p>"Bridegroom, thou beloved hero,<br> Now untie the scarlet ribbons,<br> And remove the silken muffler,<br> Let us see the honey-maiden,<br> See the Daughter of the Rainbow.<br> Seven years hast thou been wooing,<br> Hast thou brought the maid affianced,<br> Wainamoinen's Wedding-Songs.<br> Hast thou sought a sweeter cuckoo,<br> Sought one fairer than the moonlight,<br> Sought a mermaid from the ocean?<br> But I know without the asking,<br> See the answer to my question:<br> Thou hast brought the sweet-voiced cuckoo,<br> Thou hast found the swan of beauty<br> Plucked the sweetest flower of Northland,<br> Culled the fairest of the jewels,<br> Gathered Pohya's sweetest berry!"</p> 
<p>Sat a babe upon the matting,<br> And the young child spake as follows:<br> "Brother, what is this thou bringest,<br> Aspen-log or trunk of willow,<br> Slender as the mountain-linden?<br> Bridegroom, well dost thou remember,<br> Thou hast hoped it all thy life-time,<br> Hoped to bring the Maid of Beauty,<br> Thou a thousand times hast said it,<br> Better far than any other,<br> Not one like the croaking raven,<br> Nor the magpie from the border,<br> Nor the scarecrow from the corn-fields,<br> Nor the vulture from the desert.<br> What has this one done of credit,<br> In the summer that has ended?<br> Where the gloves that she has knitted,<br> Where the mittens she has woven?<br> Thou hast brought her empty-handed,<br> Not a gift she brings thy father;<br> In thy chests the nice are nesting,<br> Long-tails feeding on thy vestments,<br> And thy bride, cannot repair them."</p> 
<p>Lakko hostess of Wainola,<br> She the faithful Kalew-daughter, <br> Hears the young child's speech in wonder,<br> Speaks these words of disapproval:<br> Silly prattler, cease thy talking,<br> Thou Last spoken in dishonor;<br> Let all others be astonished,<br> Reap thy malice on thy kindred,<br> must not harm the Bride of Beauty,<br> Rainbow-daughter of the Northland.<br> False indeed is this thy Prattle,<br> All thy words are full or evil,<br> Fallen from thy tongue of mischief<br> From the lips of one unworthy.<br> Excellent the hero 's young bride,<br> Best of all in Sariola,<br> Like the, strawberry in summer,<br> Like the daisy from the meadow,<br> Like the cuckoo from the forest,<br> Like the bluebird from the aspen,<br> Like the redbreast from the heather,<br> Like the martin. from the linden;<br> Never couldst thou find in Ehstland<br> Such a virgin as this daughter,<br> Such a graceful beauteous maiden,<br> With such dignity of Carriage,<br> With such arms of pearly whiteness,<br> With. a neck so fair and lovely.<br> Neither is she empty-handed,<br> She has brought us furs abundant, <br> Brought us many silken garments,<br> Richest weavings of Pohyola.<br> Many beauteous things the maiden,<br> With the spindle has accomplished,<br> Spun and woven with her fingers<br> Dresses of the finest texture<br> She in winter has upfolded,<br> Bleached them in the days of spring-time,<br> Dried them at the hour of noon-day,<br> For our couches finest linen,<br> For our heads the softest pillows,<br> For our comfort woollen blankets,<br> For our necks the silken ribbons."<br> To the bride speaks gracious Lakko:<br> "Goodly wife, thou Maid of Beauty,<br> Highly wert thou praised as daughter,<br> In thy father's distant country;<br> Here thou shalt be praised forever<br> By the kindred of thy husband;<br> Thou shalt never suffer sorrow,<br> Never give thy heart to grieving;<br> In the swamps thou wert not nurtured,<br> Wert not fed beside the brooklets;<br> Thou wert born 'neath stars auspicious,<br> Nurtured from the richest garners,<br> Thou wert taken to the brewing<br> Of the sweetest beer in Northland.</p> 
<p>"Beauteous bride from Sariola,<br> Shouldst thou see me bringing hither<br> Casks of corn, or wheat, or barley;<br> Bringing rye in great abundance,<br> They belong to this thy household;<br> Good the plowing of thy husband.<br> Good his sowing and his reaping.</p> 
<p>"Bride of Beauty from the Northland,<br> Thou wilt learn this home to manage,<br> Learn to labor with thy kindred;<br> Good the home for thee to dwell in,<br> Good enough for bride and daughter.<br> At thy hand will rest the milk-pail,<br> And the churn awaits thine order;<br> It is well here for the maiden,<br> Happy will the young bride labor,<br> Easy are the resting-benches;<br> Here the host is like thy father,<br> Like thy mother is the hostess,<br> All the sons are like thy brothers,<br> Like thy sisters are the daughters.</p> 
<p>"Shouldst thou ever have a longing<br> For the whiting of the ocean,<br> For thy, father's Northland salmon,<br> For thy brother's hazel-chickens,<br> Ask them only of thy husband,<br> Let thy hero-husband bring them.<br> There is not in all of Northland,<br> Not a creature of the forest,<br> Not a bird beneath the ether,<br> Not a fish within the waters,<br> Not the largest, nor the smallests<br> That thy husband cannot capture.<br> It is well here for the maiden,<br> Here the bride may live in freedom,<br> Need not turn the heavy millstone,<br> Need not move the iron pestle;<br> Here the wheat is ground by water,<br> For the rye, the swifter current,<br> While the billows wash the vessels<br> And the surging waters rinse them.<br> Thou hast here a lovely village,<br> Finest spot in all of Northland,<br> In the lowlands sweet the verdure,<br> in the uplands, fields of beauty,<br> With the lake-shore near the hamlet,<br> Near thy home the running water,<br> Where the goslings swim and frolic,<br> Water-birds disport in numbers."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the bride and bridegroom<br> Were refreshed with richest viands,<br> Given food and drink abundant,<br> Fed on choicest bits of reindeer,<br> On the sweetest loaves of barley,<br> On the best of wheaten biscuits,<br> On the richest beer of Northland.<br> Many things were on the table,<br> Many dainties of Wainola,<br> In the bowls of scarlet color,<br> In the platters deftly painted,<br> Many cakes with honey sweetened,<br> To each guest was butter given,<br> Many bits of trout and whiting,<br> Larger salmon carved in slices,<br> With the knives of molten silver,<br> Rimmed with gold the silver handles,<br> Beer of barley ceaseless flowing,<br> Honey-drink that was not purchased,<br> In the cellar flows profusely,<br> Beer for all, the tongues to quicken,<br> Mead and beer the minds to freshen.<br> Who is there to lead the singing,<br> Lead the songs of Kalevala?</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> The eternal, wise enchanter,<br> Quick begins his incantations,<br> Straightway sings the songs that follow.<br> "Golden brethren, dearest kindred,<br> Ye, my loved ones, wise and worthy<br> Ye companions, highly-gifted,<br> Listen to my simple sayings:<br> Rarely stand the geese together,<br> Sisters do not mate each other,<br> Not together stand the brothers,<br> Nor the children of one mother,<br> In the countries of the Northland.</p> 
<p>"Shall we now begin the singing,<br> Sing the songs of old tradition?<br> Singers can but sing their wisdom,<br> And the cuckoo call the spring-time,<br> And the goddess of the heavens<br> Only dyes the earth in beauty;<br> So the goddesses of weaving<br> Can but weave from dawn till twilight,<br> Ever sing the youth of Lapland<br> In their straw-shoes full of gladness,<br> When the coarse-meat of the roebuck,<br> Or of blue-moose they have eaten.<br> Wherefore should I not be singing,<br> And the children not be chanting<br> Of the biscuits of Wainola,<br> Of the bread of Kalew-waters?<br> Even Sing the lads of Lapland<br> In their straw-shoes filled with joyance,<br> Drinking but a cup of water,<br> Eating but the bitter tan-bark.<br> Wherefore should I not be singing,<br> And the children not be chanting<br> Of the beer of Kalevala,<br> Brewed from barley in perfection,<br> Dressed in quaint and homely costume,<br> As they sit beside their hearth-stones.<br> Wherefore should I not be singing,<br> And the children too be chanting<br> Underneath these painted rafters,<br> In these halls renowned and ancient?<br> This the place for men to linger,<br> This the court-room for the maidens,<br> Near the foaming beer of barley,<br> Honey-brewed in great abundance,<br> Very near, the salmon-waters,<br> Near, the nets for trout and whiting,<br> Here where food is never wanting,<br> Where the beer is ever brewing.<br> Here Wainola's sons assemble,<br> Here Wainola's daughters gather,<br> Here they never eat in trouble,<br> Here they live without regretting,<br> In the life-time of the landlord,<br> While the hostess lives and prospers.</p> 
<p>"Who shall first be sung and lauded?<br> Shall it be the bride or bridegroom?<br> Let us praise the bridegroom's father,<br> Let the hero-host be chanted,<br> Him whose home is in the forest,<br> Him who built upon the mountains,<br> Him who brought the trunks of lindens,<br> With their tops and slender branches,<br> Brought them to the best of places,<br> Joined them skilfully together,<br> For the mansion of the nation,<br> For this famous hero-dwelling,<br> Walls procured upon the lowlands,<br> Rafters from the pine and fir-tree,<br> From the woodlands beams of oak-wood,<br> From the berry-plains the studding,<br> Bark was furnished by the aspen,<br> And the mosses from the fenlands.<br> Trimly builded is this mansion,<br> In a haven warmly sheltered;<br> Here a hundred men have labored,<br> On the roof have stood a thousand,<br> As this spacious house was building,<br> As this roof was tightly jointed.<br> Here the ancient mansion-builder,<br> When these rafters were erected,<br> Lost in storms his locks of sable,<br> Scattered by the winds of heaven.<br> Often has the hero-landlord<br> On the rocks his gloves forgotten,<br> Left his hat upon the willows,<br> Lost his mittens in the marshes;<br> Oftentimes the mansion-builder,<br> In the early hours of morning,<br> Ere his workmen had awakened,<br> Unperceived by all the village,<br> Has arisen from his slumber,<br> Left his cabin the snow-fields,<br> Combed his locks among the branches,<br> Bathed his eyes in dews of morning.</p> 
<p>"Thus obtained the pleasant landlord<br> Friends to fill his spacious dwelling,<br> Fill his benches with magicians,<br> Fill his windows with enchanters,<br> Fill his halls with wizard-singers,<br> Fill his floors with ancient speakers,<br> Fill his ancient court with strangers,<br> Fill his hurdles with the needy;<br> Thus the Kalew-host is lauded.</p> 
<p>"Now I praise the genial hostess,<br> Who prepares the toothsome dinner,<br> Fills with plenty all her tables,<br> Bakes the honeyed loaves of barley,<br> Kneads the dough with magic fingers,<br> With her arms of strength and beauty,<br> Bakes her bread in copper ovens,<br> Feeds her guests and bids them welcome,<br> Feeds them on the toothsome bacon,<br> On the trout, and pike, and whiting,<br> On the rarest fish in ocean,<br> On the dainties of Wainola.</p> 
<p>"Often has the faithful hostess<br> Risen from her couch in silence,<br> Ere the crowing of the watcher,<br> To prepare the wedding-banquet,<br> Make her tables look attractive.<br> Brew the honey-beer of wedlock.<br> Excellently has the housewife,<br> Has the hostess filled with wisdom,<br> Brewed the beer from hops and barley,<br> From the corn of Kalevala,<br> From the wheat-malt honey-seasoned,<br> Stirred the beer with graceful fingers,<br> At the oven in the penthouse,<br> In the chamber swept and polished.<br> Neither did the prudent hostess,<br> Beautiful, and full of wisdom,<br> Let the barley sprout too freely,<br> Lest the beer should taste of black-earth,<br> Be too bitter in the brewing,<br> Often went she to the garners,<br> Went alone at hour of midnight,<br> Was not frightened by the black-wolf,<br> Did not fear the beasts of woodlands.</p> 
<p>"Now the hostess I have lauded,<br> Let me praise the favored suitor,<br> Now the honored hero-bridegroom,<br> Best of all the village-masters.<br> Clothed in purple is the hero,<br> Raiment brought from distant nations,<br> Tightly fitting to his body;<br> Snugly sets his coat of ermine,<br> To the floor it hangs in beauty,<br> Trailing from his neck and shoulders,<br> Little of his vest appearing,<br> Peeping through his outer raiment,<br> Woven by the Moon's fair daughters,<br> And his vestment silver-tinselled.<br> Dressed in neatness is the suitor,<br> Round his waist a belt of copper,<br> Hammered by the Sun's sweet maidens,<br> Ere the early fires were lighted,<br> Ere the fire had been discovered.<br> Dressed in richness is the bridegroom,<br> On his feet are silken stockings,<br> Silken ribbons on his ankles,<br> Gold and silver interwoven.<br> Dressed in beauty is the bridegroom,<br> On his feet are shoes of deer-skin,<br> Like the swans upon the water,<br> Like the blue-duck on the sea-waves,<br> Like the thrush among the willows,<br> Like the water-birds of Northland.<br> Well adorned the hero-suitor,<br> With his locks of golden color,<br> With his gold-beard finely braided,<br> Hero-hat upon his forehead,<br> Piercing through the forest branches,<br> Reaching to the clouds of heaven,<br> Bought with countless gold and silver,<br> Priceless is the suitor's head-gear.</p> 
<p>"Now the bridegroom has been lauded,<br> I will praise the young bride's playmate,<br> Day-companion in her childhood,<br> In the maiden's magic mansion.<br> Whence was brought the merry maiden,<br> From the village of Tanikka?<br> Thence was never brought the playmate,<br> Playmate of the bride in childhood.<br> Has she come from distant nations,<br> From the waters of the Dwina,<br> O'er the ocean far-outstretching?<br> Not from Dwina came the maiden,<br> Did not sail across the waters;<br> Grew as berry in the mountains,<br> As a strawberry of sweetness,<br> On the fields the child of beauty,<br> In the glens the golden flower.<br> Thence has come the young bride's playmate,<br> Thence arose her fair companion.<br> Tiny are her feet and fingers,<br> Small her lips of scarlet color,<br> Like the maiden's loom of Suomi;<br> Eyes that shine in kindly beauty<br> Like the twinkling stars of heaven;<br> Beam the playmate's throbbing temples<br> Like the moonlight on the waters.<br> Trinkets has the bride's companion,<br> On her neck a golden necklace,<br> In her tresses, silken ribbons,<br> On her arms are golden bracelets,<br> Golden rings upon her fingers,<br> Pearls are set in golden ear-rings,<br> Loops of gold upon her temples,<br> And with pearls her brow is studded.<br> Northland thought the Moon was shining<br> When her jeweled ear-ringsglistened;<br> Thought the Sun had left his station<br> When her girdle shone in beauty;<br> Thought a ship was homeward sailing<br> When her colored head-gear fluttered.<br> Thus is praised the bride's companion,<br> Playmate of the Rainbow-maiden.</p> 
<p>"Now I praise the friends assembled,<br> All appear in graceful manners;<br> If the old are wise and silent,<br> All the youth are free and merry,<br> All the guests are fair and worthy.<br> Never was there in Wainola,<br> Never will there be in Northland,<br> Such a company assembled;<br> All the children speak in joyance,<br> All the aged move sedately;<br> Dressed in white are all the maidens,<br> Like the hoar-frost of the morning,<br> Like the welcome dawn of spring-time,<br> Like the rising of the daylight.<br> Silver then was more abundant,<br> Gold among the guests in plenty,<br> On the hills were money, pockets,<br> Money-bags along the valleys,<br> For the friends that were invited,<br> For the guests in joy assembled.<br> All the friends have now been lauded,<br> Each has gained his meed of honor."</p> 
<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br> Song-deliverer of Northland,<br> Swung himself upon the fur-bench<br> Or his magic sledge of copper,<br> Straightway hastened to his hamlet,<br> Singing as he journeyed onward,<br> Singing charms and incantations,<br> Singing one day, then a second,<br> All the third day chanting legends.<br> On the rocks the runners rattled,<br> Hung the sledge upon a birch-stump,<br> Broke it into many pieces,<br> With the magic of his singing;<br> Double were the runners bended,<br> All the parts were torn asunder,<br> And his magic sledge was ruined.</p> 
<p>Then the good, old Wainamoinen<br> Spake these words in meditation:<br> "Is there one among this number,<br> In this rising generation,<br> Or perchance among the aged,<br> In the passing generation,<br> That will go to Mana's kingdom,<br> To the empire of Tuoni,<br> There to get the magic auger<br> From the master of Manala,<br> That I may repair my snow-sledge,<br> Or a second sledge may fashion?"</p> 
<p>What the younger people answered<br> Was the answer of the aged:<br> "Not among the youth of Northland,<br> Nor among the aged heroes,<br> Is there one of ample courage,<br> That has bravery sufficient,<br> To attempt the reckless journey<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> To Manala's fields and castles,<br> Thence to bring Tuoni's auger,<br> Wherewithal to mend thy snow-sledge,<br> Build anew thy sledge of magic."</p> 
<p>Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<br> The eternal wisdom-singer,<br> Went again to Mana's empire,<br> To the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> Crossed the sable stream of Deathland,<br> To the castles of Manala,<br> Found the auger of Tuoni,<br> Brought the instrument in safety.<br> Straightway sings old Wainamoinen,<br> Sings to life a purple forest,<br> In the forest, slender birches,<br> And beside them, mighty oak-trees,<br> Shapes them into shafts and runners,<br> Moulds them by his will and power,<br> Makes anew his sledge of magic.</p> 
<p>On his steed he lays the harness,<br> Binds him to his sledge securely,<br> Seats himself upon the cross-bench,<br> And the racer gallops homeward,<br> To the manger filled and waiting,<br> To the stable of his master;<br> Brings the ancient Wainamoinen,<br> Famous bard and wise enchanter,<br> To the threshold of his dwelling,<br> To his home in Kalevala.</p>
