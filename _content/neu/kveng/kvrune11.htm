<p>THIS the time to sing of Ahti,<br> Son of Lempo, Kaukomieli,<br> Also known as Lemminkainen.<br> Ahti was the king of islands,<br> Grew amid the island-dwellings,<br> At the site of his dear mother,<br> On the borders of the ocean,<br> On the points of promontories.<br> Ahti fed upon the salmon,<br> Fed upon the ocean whiting,<br> Thus became a mighty hero,<br> In his veins the blood of ages,<br> Read erect and form commanding,<br> Growth of mind and body perfect<br> But alas! he had his failings,<br> Bad indeed his heart and morals,<br> Roaming in unworthy places,<br> Staying days and nights in sequences<br> At the homes of merry maidens,<br> At the dances of the virgins,<br> With the maids of braided tresses.</p> 
<p>Up in Sahri lived a maiden,<br> Lived the fair and winsome Kulli,<br> Lovely as a summer-flower,<br> From a kingly house descended,<br> Grew to perfect form and beauty,<br> Living in her father's cottage,<br> Home of many ancient heroes,<br> Beautiful was she and queenly,<br> Praised throughout the whole of Ehstland;<br> From afar men came to woo her,<br> To the birthplace of the virgin,<br> To the household of her mother.</p> 
<p>For his son the Day-star wooes her,<br> But she will not go to Sun-land,<br> Will not shine beside the Day-star,<br> In his haste to bring the summer.<br> For her son, the bright Moon wooes her,<br> But she will not go to Moon-land,<br> By the bright Moon will not glimmer,<br> Will not run through boundless ether.</p> 
<p>For his son the Night-star wooes her,<br> But she will not go to Star-land,<br> Will not twinkle in the starlight,<br> Through the dreary nights in winter.</p> 
<p>Lovers come from distant Ehstlaud,<br> Others come from far-off Ingern,<br> But they cannot win the maiden,<br> This the answer that she gives them<br> "Vainly are your praises lavished<br> Vainly is your silver offered,<br> Wealth and praise are no temptation;<br> Never shall I go to Ehstland,<br> Never shall I go a-rowing<br> On the waters of the Ingern,<br> Shall not cross the Sahri-waters,<br> Never eat the fish of Ehstland,<br> Never taste the Ehstland viands.<br> Ingerland shall never see me,<br> Will not row upon her rivers,<br> Will not step within her borders;<br> Hunger there, and fell starvation,<br> Wood is absent, fuel wanting,<br> Neither water, wheat, nor barley,<br> Even rye is not abundant."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen of the islands,<br> Warlike hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Undertakes to win the maiden,<br> Woo and win the Sahri-flower,<br> Win a bride so highly honored,<br> Win the maid with golden tresses,<br> Win the Sahri maid of beauty;<br> But his mother gives him warning:<br> "Nay," replies his gray-haired mother,<br> "Do not woo, my son beloved,<br> Maiden of a higher station;<br> She will never make thee happy<br> With her lineage of Sahri."</p> 
<p>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> These the words of Kaukomieli:<br> "Should I come from lowly station,<br> Though my tribe is not the highest,<br> I shall woo to please my fancy,<br> Woo the maiden fair and lovely,<br> Choose a wife for worth and beauty."<br> This the anxious mother's answer:<br> "Lemminkainen, son beloved,<br> Listen to advice maternal:<br> Do not go to distant Sahri,<br> To her tribe of many branches;<br> All the maidens there will taunt thee,<br> All the women will deride thee."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, little hearing,<br> Answers thus his mother's pleading:<br> "I will still the sneers of women,<br> Silence all the taunts of maidens,<br> I will crush their haughty bosoms,<br> Smite the hands and cheeks of infants;<br> Surely this will check their insults,<br> Fitting ending to derision!"<br> This the answer of' the mother:<br> "Woe is me, my son beloved!<br> Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br> Shouldst thou taunt the Sahri daughters.<br> Or insult the maids of virtue,<br> Shouldst thou laugh them to derision,<br> There will rise a great contention,<br> Fierce the battle that will follow.<br> All the hosts of Sahri-suitors,<br> Armed in thousands will attack thee,<br> And will slay thee for thy folly."</p> 
<p>Nothing listing, Lemminkainen,<br> Heeding not his mother's warning,<br> Led his war-horse from the stables,<br> Quickly hitched the fiery charger,<br> Fleetly drove upon his journey,<br> To the distant Sahri-village,<br> There to woo the Sahri-flower,<br> There to win the Bride of Beauty.</p> 
<p>All the aged Sahri-women,<br> All the young and lovely maidens<br> Laughed to scorn the coming stranger<br> Driving careless through the alleys,<br> Wildly driving through the court-yard,<br> Now upsetting in the gate-way,<br> Breaking shaft, and hame, and runner.</p> 
<p>Then the fearless Lemminkainen,<br> Mouth awry and visage wrinkled,<br> Shook his sable locks and answered:<br> "Never in my recollection<br> Have I heard or seen such treatment,<br> Never have I been derided,<br> Never suffered sneers of women,<br> Never suffered scorn of virgins,<br> Not in my immortal life-time.<br> Is there any place befitting<br> On the Sahri-plains and pastures,<br> Where to join in songs and dances?<br> Is there here a hall for pleasure,<br> Where the Sahri-maidens linger,<br> Merry maids with braided tresses?"</p> 
<p>Thereupon the Sahri-maidens<br> Answered from their promontory.,<br> "Room enough is there in Sahri,<br> Room upon the Sahri-pastures,<br> Room for pleasure-halls and dances;<br> Sing and dance upon our meadows,<br> Be a shepherd on the mountains,<br> Shepherd-boys have room for dancing;<br> Indolent the Sahri-children,<br> But the colts are fat and frisky."</p> 
<p>Little caring, Lemminkainen<br> Entered service there as shepherd,<br> In the daytime on the pastures,<br> In the evening, making merry<br> At the games of lively maidens,<br> At the dances with the virgins,<br> With the maids with braided tresses.<br> Thus it was that Lemminkainen,<br> Thus the shepherd, Kaukomieli,<br> Quickly hushed the women's laughter,<br> Quickly quenched the taunts of maidens,<br> Quickly silenced their derision.<br> All the dames and Sahri-daughters<br> Soon were feasting Lemminkainen,<br> At his side they danced and lingered.<br> Only was there one among them,<br> One among the Sahri-virgins,<br> Harbored neither love nor wooers,<br> Favored neither gods nor heroes,<br> This the lovely maid Kyllikki,<br> This the Sahri's fairest flower.<br> Lemminkainen, full of pleasure,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Rowed a hundred boats in pieces,<br> Pulled a thousand oars to fragments,<br> While he wooed the Maid of Beauty,<br> Tried to win the fair Kyllikki.</p> 
<p>Finally the lovely maiden,<br> Fairest daughter of the Northland,<br> Thus addresses Lemminkainen:<br> "Why dost linger here, thou weak one,<br> Why dost murmur on these borders,<br> Why come wooing at my fireside,<br> Wooing me in belt of copper?<br> Have no time to waste upon thee,<br> Rather give this stone its polish,<br> Rather would I turn the pestle<br> In the heavy sandstone mortar;<br> Rather sit beside my mother<br> In the dwellings of my father.<br> Never shall I heed thy wooing,<br> Neither wights nor whisks I care for,<br> Sooner have a slender husband<br> Since I have a slender body;<br> Wish to have him fine of figure,<br> Since perchance I am well-shapen;<br> Wish to have him tall and stately,<br> Since my form perchance is queenly;<br> Never waste thy time in wooing<br> Saliri's maid and favored flower."</p> 
<p>Time had gone but little distance,<br> Scarcely had a month passed over,<br> When upon a merry evening,<br> Where the maidens meet for dancing,<br> In the glen beyond the meadow,<br> On a level patch of verdure,<br> Came too soon the maid Kyllikki,<br> Sahri's pride, the Maid of Beauty;<br> Quickly followed Lemminkainen,<br> With his stallion proudly prancing,<br> Fleetest racer of the Northland,<br> Fleetly drives beyond the meadow,<br> Where the maidens meet for dancing,<br> Snatches quick the maid Kyllikki,<br> On the settle seats the maiden,<br> Quickly draws the leathern cover,<br> And adjusts the brichen cross-bar,<br> Whips his courser to a gallop.<br> With a rush, and roar, and rattle,<br> Speeds he homeward like the storm-wind,<br> Speaks these words to those that listen:<br> "Never, never, anxious maidens,<br> Must ye give the information,<br> That I carried off Kyllikki<br> To my distant home and kindred.<br> If ye do not heed this order,<br> Ye shall badly fare as maidens;<br> I shall sing to war your suitors,<br> Sing them under spear and broadsword,<br> That for months, and years, and ages,<br> Never ye will see their faces,<br> Never hear their merry voices,<br> Never will they tread these uplands,<br> Never will they join these dances,<br> Never will they drive these highways."</p> 
<p>Sad the wailing of Kyllikki,<br> Sad the weeping flower of Sahri!<br> Listen to her tearful pleading:<br> "Give, O give me back my freedom,<br> Free me from the throes of thralldom,<br> Let this maiden wander homeward,<br> By some foot-path let me wander<br> To my father who is grieving,<br> To my mother who is weeping;<br> Let me go or I will curse thee!<br> If thou wilt not give me freedom,<br> Wilt not let me wander homeward,<br> Where my loved ones wait my coming,<br> I have seven stalwart brothers,<br> Seven sons of father's brother,<br> Seven sons of mother's sister,<br> Who pursue the tracks of red-deer,<br> Hunt the hare upon the heather;<br> They will follow thee and slay thee,<br> Thus I'll gain my wished-for freedom."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, little heeding,<br> Would not grant the maiden's wishes,<br> Would not heed her plea for mercy.<br> Spake again the waiting virgin,<br> Pride and beauty of the Northland:<br> "Joyful was I with my kindred,<br> Joyful born and softly nurtured<br> Merrily I spent my childhood,<br> Happy I, in virgin-freedom,<br> In the dwelling of my father,<br> By the bedside of my mother,<br> With my lineage in Sahri;<br> But alas! all joy has vanished,<br> All my happiness departed,<br> All my maiden beauty waneth<br> Since I met thine evil spirit,<br> Shameless hero of dishonor,<br> Cruel fighter of the islands,<br> Merciless in civil combat."</p> 
<p>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> These the words of Kaukomieli:<br> "Dearest maiden, fair Kyllikki,<br> My sweet strawberry of Pohya,<br> Still thine anguish, cease thy weeping,<br> Be thou free from care and sorrow,<br> Never shall I do thee evil,<br> Never will my hands maltreat thee,<br> Never will mine arms abuse thee,<br> Never will my tongue revile thee,<br> Never will my heart deceive thee.</p> 
<p>"Tell me why thou hast this anguish,<br> Why thou hast this bitter sorrow,<br> Why this sighing and lamenting,<br> Tell me why this wail of sadness?<br> Banish all thy cares and sorrows,<br> Dry thy tears and still thine anguish,<br> I have cattle, food, and shelter,<br> I have home, and friends, and kindred,<br> Kine upon the plains and uplands,<br> In the marshes berries plenty,<br> Strawberries upon the mountains<br> I have kine that need no milking,<br> Handsome kine that need no feeding,<br> Beautiful if not well-tended;<br> Need not tie them up at evening,<br> Need not free them in the morning,<br> Need not hunt them, need not feed them,<br> Need not give them salt nor water.</p> 
<p>"Thinkest thou my race is lowly,<br> Dost thou think me born ignoble,<br> Does my lineage agrieve thee?<br> Was not born in lofty station,<br> From a tribe of noble heroes,<br> From a worthy race descended;<br> But I have a sword of fervor,<br> And a spear yet filled with courage,<br> Surely these are well descended,<br> These were born from hero-races,<br> Sharpened by the mighty Hisi,<br> By the gods were forged and burnished;<br> Therefore will I give thee greatness,<br> Greatness of my race and nation,<br> With my broadsword filled with fervor,<br> With my spear still filled with courage."</p> 
<p>Anxiously the sighing maiden<br> Thus addresses Lemminkainen:<br> "O thou Ahti, son of Lempo,<br> Wilt thou take this trusting virgin,<br> As thy faithful life-companion,<br> Take me under thy protection,<br> Be to me a faithful husband,<br> Swear to me an oath of honor,<br> That thou wilt not go to battle,<br> When for gold thou hast a longing,<br> When thou wishest gold and silver?"<br> This is Lemminkainen's answer:<br> I will swear an oath of honor,<br> That I'll never go to battle,<br> When for gold I feel a longing,<br> When I wish for gold and silver.<br> Swear thou also on thine honor,<br> Thou wilt go not to the village,<br> When desire for dance impels thee,<br> Wilt not visit village-dances."</p> 
<p>Thus the two made oath together,<br> Registered their vows in heaven,<br> Vowed before omniscient Ukko,<br> Ne'er to go to war vowed Ahti,<br> Never to the dance, Kyllikki.</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, full of joyance,<br> Snapped his whip above his courser,<br> Whipped his racer to a gallop,<br> And these words the hero uttered:<br> "Fare ye well, ye Sahri-meadows,<br> Roots of firs, and stumps of birch-trees.<br> That I wandered through in summer,<br> That I travelled o'er in winter,<br> Where ofttimes in rainy seasons,<br> At the evening hour I lingered,<br> When I sought to win the virgin,<br> Sought to win the Maid of Beauty,<br> Fairest of the Sahri-flowers.<br> Fare ye well, ye Sahri-woodlands,<br> Seas and oceans, lakes and rivers,<br> Vales and mountains, isles and inlets,<br> Once the home of fair Kyllikki!"</p> 
<p>Quick the racer galloped homeward,<br> Galloped on along the highway,<br> Toward the meadows of Wainola,<br> To the plains of Kalevala.</p> 
<p>As they neared the Ahti-dwellings,<br> Thus Kyllikki spake in sorrow:<br> "Cold and drear is thy cottage,<br> Seeming like a place deserted;<br> Who may own this dismal cabin,<br> Who the one so little honored?"</p> 
<p>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> These the words that Ahti uttered:<br> "Do not grieve about my cottage,<br> Have no care about my chambers;<br> I shall build thee other dwellings,<br> I shall fashion them much better,<br> Beams, and posts, and sills, and rafters,<br> Fashioned from the sacred birch-wood."</p> 
<p>Now they reach the home of Ahti,<br> Lemminkainen's home and birthplace,<br> Enter they his mother's cottage;<br> There they meet his aged mother,<br> These the words the mother uses:<br> "Long indeed hast thou been absent,<br> Long in foreign lands hast wandered,<br> Long in Sahri thou hast lingered!"<br> This is Lemminkainen's answer:<br> "All the host of Sahri-women,<br> All the chaste and lovely maidens,<br> All the maids with braided tresses,<br> Well have paid for their derision,<br> For their scorn and for their laughter,<br> That they basely heaped upon me.<br> I have brought the best among them<br> In my sledge to this thy cottage;<br> Well I wrapped her in my fur-robes,<br> Kept her warm enwrapped in bear-skin,<br> Brought her to my mother's dwelling,<br> As my faithful life-companion;<br> Thus I paid the scornful maidens,<br> Paid them well for their derision.</p> 
<p>"Cherished mother of my being,<br> I have found the long-sought jewel,<br> I have won the Maid of Beauty.<br> Spread our couch with finest linen,<br> For our heads the softest pillows,<br> On our table rarest viands,<br> So that I may dwell in pleasure<br> With my spouse, the bride of honor,<br> With the pride of distant Sahri."<br> This the answer of the mother:<br> "Be thou praised, O gracious Ukko,<br> Loudly praised, O thou Creator,<br> Since thou givest me a daughter,<br> Ahti's bride, my second daughter,<br> Who can stir the fire at evening,<br> Who can weave me finest fabrics,<br> Who can twirl the useful spindle,<br> Who can rinse my silken ribbons,<br> Who can full the richest garments.</p> 
<p>"Son beloved, praise thy Maker,<br> For the winning of this virgin,<br> Pride and joy of distant Sahri<br> Kind indeed is thy Creator,<br> Wise the ever-knowing Ukko!<br> Pure the snow upon the mountains,<br> Purer still thy Bride of Beauty;<br> White the foam upon the ocean,<br> Whiter still her virgin-spirit;<br> Graceful on the lakes, the white-swan,<br> Still more graceful, thy companion:<br> Beautiful the stars in heaven,<br> Still more beautiful, Kyllikki.<br> Larger make our humble cottage,<br> Wider build the doors and windows,<br> Fashion thou the ceilings higher,<br> Decorate the walls in beauty,<br> Now that thou a bride hast taken<br> From a tribe of higher station,<br> Purest maiden of creation,<br> From the meadow-lands of Sahri,<br> From the upper shores of Northland."</p>
