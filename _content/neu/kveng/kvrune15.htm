<p>LEMMINKAINEN'S aged mother<br> Anxious roams about the islands,<br> Anxious wonders in her chambers,<br> What the fate of Lemminkainen,<br> Why her son so long has tarried;<br> Thinks that something ill has happened<br> To her hero in Pohyola.<br> Sad, indeed, the mother's anguish,<br> As in vain she waits his coming,<br> As in vain she asks the question,<br> Where her daring son is roaming,<br> Whether to the fir-tree mountain,<br> Whether to the distant heath-land,<br> Or upon the broad-sea's ridges,<br> On the floods and rolling waters,<br> To the war's contending armies,<br> To the heat and din of battle,<br> Steeped in blood of valiant heroes,<br> Evidence of fatal warfare.</p> 
<p>Daily does the wife Kyllikki<br> Look about her vacant chamber,<br> In the home of Lemminkainen,<br> At the court of Kaukomieli;<br> Looks at evening, looks at morning,<br> Looks, perchance, upon his hair-brush,<br> Sees alas! the blood-drops oozing,<br> Oozing from the golden bristles,<br> And the blood-drops, scarlet-colored.</p> 
<p>Then the beauteous wife, Kyllikki,<br> Spake these words in deeps of anguish:<br> "Dead or wounded is my husband,<br> Or at best is filled with trouble,<br> Lost perhaps in Northland forests,<br> In some glen unknown to heroes,<br> Since alas! the blood is flowing<br> From the brush of Lemminkainen,<br> Red drops oozing from the bristles."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the anxious mother<br> Looks upon the bleeding hair-brush<br> And begins this wail of anguish:<br> "Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<br> Woe is me, all joy departed!<br> For alas! my son and hero,<br> Valiant hero of the islands,<br> Son of trouble and misfortune!<br> Some sad fate has overtaken<br> My ill-fated Lemminkainen!<br> Blood is flowing from his hair-brush,<br> Oozing from its golden bristles,<br> And the drops are scarlet-colored."</p> 
<p>Quick her garment's hem she clutches,<br> On her arm she throws her long-robes,<br> Fleetly flies upon her journey;<br> With her might she hastens northward,<br> Mountains tremble from her footsteps,<br> Valleys rise and heights are lowered,<br> Highlands soon become as lowlands,<br> All the hills and valleys levelled.<br> Soon she gains the Northland village,<br> Quickly asks about her hero,<br> These the words the mother utters:<br> "O thou hostess of Pohyola,<br> Where hast thou my Lemminkainen?<br> Tell me of my son and hero!"</p> 
<p>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br> Gives this answer to the mother:<br> "Nothing know I of thy hero,<br> Of the hero of the islands;<br> Where thy son may be I know not,<br> Cannot lend the information;<br> Once I gave thy son a courser,<br> Hitched the racer to his snow-sledge,<br> This the last of Lemminkainen;<br> May perchance be drowned in Wuhne,<br> Frozen In the icy ocean,<br> Fallen prey to wolves in hunger,<br> In a bear's den may have perished."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answers:<br> "Thou art only speaking falsehoods,<br> Northland wolves cannot devour us,<br> Nor the bears kill Kaukomieli;<br> He can slay the wolves of Pohya<br> With the fingers of his left hand;<br> Bears of Northland he would silence<br> With the magic of his singing.</p> 
<p>"Hostess of Pohyola, tell me<br> Whither thou hast sent my hero;<br> I shall burst thy many garners,<br> Shall destroy the magic Sampo,<br> If thou dost not tell me truly<br> Where to find my Lemminkainen."<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "I have well thy hero treated,<br> Well my court has entertained him,<br> Gave him of my rarest viands,<br> Fed him at my well-filled tables,<br> Placed him in a boat of copper,<br> Thus to float adown the current,<br> This the last of Lemminkainen;<br> Cannot tell where he has wandered.<br> Whether in the foam of waters,<br> Whether in the boiling torrent,<br> Whether in the drowning whirlpool."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen's mother answers:<br> Thou again art speaking falsely;<br> Tell me now the truth I pray thee,<br> Make an end of thy deception,<br> Where is now my Lemminkainen,<br> Whither hast thou sent my hero,<br> Young and daring son of Kalew?<br> If a third time thou deceivest,<br> I will send thee plagues, unnumbered,<br> I will send thee fell destruction,<br> Certain death will overtake thee."<br> Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br> "This the third time that I answer,<br> This the truth that I shall tell thee:<br> I have sent the Kalew-hero<br> To the Hisi-fields and forests,<br> There to hunt the moose of Lempo;<br> Sent him then to catch the fire-horse,<br> Catch the fire-expiring stallion,<br> On the distant plains of Juutas,<br> In the realm of cruel Hisi.<br> Then I sent him to the Death-stream,<br> In the kingdom of Tuoni,<br> With his bow and but one arrow,<br> There to shoot the swan as dowry<br> For my best and fairest daughter;<br> Have not heard about thy hero<br> Since he left for Tuonela;<br> May in misery have fallen,<br> May have perished in Manala;<br> Has not come to ask my daughter,<br> Has not come to woo the maiden,<br> Since he left to hunt the death-swan."</p> 
<p>Now the mother seeks her lost one,<br> For her son she weeps and trembles,<br> Like the wolf she bounds through fenlands,<br> Like the bear, through forest thickets,<br> Like the wild-boar, through the marshes,<br> Like the hare, along the sea-coast,<br> To the sea-point, like the hedgehog<br> Like the wild-duck swims the waters,<br> Casts the rubbish from her pathway,<br> Tramples down opposing brush-wood,<br> Stops at nothing in her journey<br> Seeks a long time for her hero,<br> Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him.</p> 
<p>Now she asks the trees the question,<br> And the forest gives this answer:<br> "We have care enough already,<br> Cannot think about thy matters;<br> Cruel fates have we to battle,<br> Pitiful our own misfortunes!<br> We are felled and chopped in pieces,<br> Cut in blocks for hero-fancy,<br> We are burned to death as fuel,<br> No one cares how much we suffer."</p> 
<p>Now again the mother wanders,<br> Seeks again her long-lost hero,<br> Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him.<br> Paths arise and come to meet her,<br> And she questions thus the pathways:<br> "Paths of hope that God has fashioned,<br> Have ye seen my Lemminkainen,<br> Has my son and golden hero<br> Travelled through thy many kingdoms?"<br> Sad, the many pathways answer:<br> "We ourselves have cares sufficient,<br> Cannot watch thy son and hero,<br> Wretched are the lives of pathways,<br> Deep indeed our own misfortunes;<br> We are trodden by, the red-deer,<br> By the wolves, and bears, and roebucks,<br> Driven o'er by heavy cart-wheels,<br> By the feet of dogs are trodden,<br> Trodden under foot of heroes,<br> Foot-paths for contending armies."</p> 
<p>Seeks again the frantic mother,<br> Seeks her long-lost son and hero,<br> Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him;<br> Finds the Moon within her orbit,<br> Asks the Moon in pleading measures:<br> "Golden Moon, whom God has stationed<br> In the heavens, the Sun's companion,<br> Hast thou seen my Kaukomieli,<br> Hast thou seen my silver apple,<br> Anywhere in thy dominions? "<br> Thus the golden Moon makes answer:<br> "I have trouble all-sufficient,<br> Cannot watch thy daring hero;<br> Long the journey I must travel,<br> Sad the fate to me befallen,<br> Pitiful mine own misfortunes,<br> All alone the nights to wander,<br> Shine alone without a respite,<br> In the winter ever watching,<br> In the summer sink and perish."</p> 
<p>Still the mother seeks, and wanders,<br> Seeks, and does not find her hero,<br> Sees the Sun in the horizon,<br> And the mother thus entreats him:<br> Silver Sun, whom God has fashioned,<br> Thou that giveth warmth and comfort,<br> Hast thou lately seen my hero,<br> Hast thou seen my Lemminkainen,<br> Wandering in thy dominions?"<br> Thus the Sun in kindness answers:<br> "Surely has thy hero perished,<br> To ingratitude a victim;<br> Lemminkainen died and vanished<br> In Tuoni's fatal river,<br> In the waters of Manala,<br> In the sacred stream and whirlpool,<br> In the cataract and rapids,<br> Sank within the drowning current<br> To the realm of Tuonela,<br> To Manala's lower regions."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen's mother weeping,<br> Wailing in the deeps of anguish,<br> Mourns the fate of Kaukomieli,<br> Hastens to the Northland smithy,<br> To the forge of Ilmarinen,<br> These the words the mother utters:<br> "Ilmarinen, metal-artist,<br> Thou that long ago wert forging,<br> Forging earth a concave cover,<br> Yesterday wert forging wonders,<br> Forge thou now, immortal blacksmith,<br> Forge a rake with shaft of copper,<br> Forge the teeth of strongest metal,<br> Teeth in length a hundred fathoms,<br> And five hundred long the handle."</p> 
<p>Ilmarinen does as bidden,<br> Makes the rake in full perfection.<br> Lemminkainen's anxious mother<br> Takes the magic rake and hastens<br> To the river of Tuoni,<br> Praying to the Sun as follows:<br> "Thou, O Sun, by God created,<br> Thou that shinest on thy Maker,<br> Shine for me in heat of magic,<br> Give me warmth, and strength, and courage,<br> Shine a third time full of power,<br> Lull to sleep the wicked people,<br> Still the people of Manala,<br> Quiet all Tuoni's empire."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the sun of Ukko,<br> Dearest child of the Creator,<br> Flying through the groves of Northland,<br> Sitting on a curving birch-tree,<br> Shines a little while in ardor,<br> Shines again in greater fervor,<br> Shines a third time full of power,<br> Lulls to sleep the wicked people<br> In the Manala home and kingdom,<br> Still the heroes with their broadswords,<br> Makes the lancers halt and totter,<br> Stills the stoutest of the spearmen,<br> Quiets Tuoni's ghastly empire.<br> Now the Sun retires in magic,<br> Hovers here and there a moment<br> Over Tuoni's hapless sleepers,<br> Hastens upward to his station,<br> To his Jumala home and kingdom.</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen's faithful mother<br> Takes the rake of magic metals,<br> Rakes the Tuoni river bottoms,<br> Rakes the cataract and whirlpool,<br> Rakes the swift and boiling current<br> Of the sacred stream of death-land,<br> In the Manala home and kingdom.<br> Searching for her long-lost hero,<br> Rakes a long time, finding nothing;<br> Now she wades the river deeper,<br> To her belt in mud and water,<br> Deeper, deeper, rakes the death-stream,<br> Rakes the river's deepest caverns,<br> Raking up and down the current,<br> Till at last she finds his tunic,<br> Heavy-hearted, finds his jacket;<br> Rakes again and rakes unceasing,<br> Finds the hero's shoes and stockings,<br> Sorely troubled, finds these relies;<br> Now she wades the river deeper,<br> Rakes the Manala shoals and shallows,<br> Rakes the deeps at every angle;<br> As she draws the rake the third time<br> From the Tuoni shores and waters,<br> In the rake she finds the body<br> Of her long-lost Lemminkainen,<br> In the metal teeth entangled,<br> In the rake with copper handle.</p> 
<p>Thus the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> Thus the son of Kalevala,<br> Was recovered from the bottom<br> Of the Manala lake and river.<br> There were wanting many fragments,<br> Half the head, a hand, a fore-arm,<br> Many other smaller portions,<br> Life, above all else, was missing.<br> Then the mother, well reflecting,<br> Spake these words in bitter weeping:<br> "From these fragments, with my magic,<br> I will bring to life my hero."</p> 
<p>Hearing this, the raven answered,<br> Spake these measures to the mother:<br> "There is not in these a hero,<br> Thou canst not revive these fragments;<br> Eels have fed upon his body,<br> On his eyes have fed the whiting;<br> Cast the dead upon the waters,<br> On the streams of Tuonela,<br> Let him there become a walrus,<br> Or a seal, or whale, or porpoise."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen's mother does not<br> Cast the dead upon the waters,<br> On the streams of Tuonela,<br> She again with hope and courage,<br> Rakes the river lengthwise, crosswise,<br> Through the Manala pools and caverns,<br> Rakes up half the head, a fore-arm,<br> Finds a hand and half the back-bone,<br> Many other smaller portions;<br> Shapes her son from all the fragments,<br> Shapes anew her Lemminkainen,<br> Flesh to flesh with skill she places,<br> Gives the bones their proper stations,<br> Binds one member to the other,<br> Joins the ends of severed vessels,<br> Counts the threads of all the venules,<br> Knits the parts in apposition;<br> Then this prayer the mother offers:</p> 
<p>"Suonetar, thou slender virgin,<br> Goddess of the veins of heroes,<br> Skilful spinner of the vessels,<br> With thy slender, silver spindle,<br> With thy spinning-wheel of copper,<br> Set in frame of molten silver,<br> Come thou hither, thou art needed;<br> Bring the instruments for mending,<br> Firmly knit the veins together,<br> At the end join well the venules,<br> In the wounds that still are open,<br> In the members that are injured.</p> 
<p>"Should this aid be inefficient;<br> There is living in the ether,<br> In a boat enriched with silver,<br> In a copper boat, a maiden,<br> That can bring to thee assistance.<br> Come, O maiden, from the ether,<br> Virgin from the belt of heaven,<br> Row throughout these veins, O maiden,<br> Row through all these lifeless members,<br> Through the channels of the long-bones,<br> Row through every form of tissue.<br> Set the vessels in their places,<br> Lay the heart in right position,<br> Make the pulses beat together,<br> Join the smallest of the veinlets,<br> And unite with skill the sinews.<br> Take thou now a slender needle,<br> Silken thread within its eyelet,<br> Ply the silver needle gently,<br> Sew with care the wounds together.</p> 
<p>"Should this aid be inefficient,<br> Thou, O God, that knowest all things,<br> Come and give us thine assistance,<br> Harness thou thy fleetest racer<br> Call to aid thy strongest courser,<br> In thy scarlet sledge come swiftly,<br> Drive through all the bones and channels,<br> Drive throughout these lifeless tissues,<br> Drive thy courser through each vessel,<br> Bind the flesh and bones securely,<br> In the joints put finest silver,<br> Purest gold in all the fissures.</p> 
<p>"Where the skin is broken open,<br> Where the veins are torn asunder,<br> Mend these injuries with magic;<br> Where the blood has left the body,<br> There make new blood flow abundant;<br> Where the bones are rudely broken,<br> Set the parts in full perfection;<br> Where the flesh is bruised and loosened,<br> Touch the wounds with magic balsam,<br> Do not leave a part imperfect;<br> Bone, and vein, and nerve, and sinew,<br> Heart, and brain, and gland, and vessel,<br> Heal as Thou alone canst heal them."</p> 
<p>These the means the mother uses,<br> Thus she joins the lifeless members,<br> Thus she heals the death-like tissues,<br> Thus restores her son and hero<br> To his former life and likeness;<br> All his veins are knit together,<br> All their ends are firmly fastened,<br> All the parts in apposition,<br> Life returns, but speech is wanting,<br> Deaf and dumb, and blind, and senseless.<br> Now the mother speaks as follows:<br> "Where may I procure the balsam,<br> Where the drops of magic honey,<br> To anoint my son and hero,<br> Thus to heal my Lemminkainen,<br> That again his month may open,<br> May again begin his singing,<br> Speak again in words of wonder,<br> Sing again his incantations?</p> 
<p>"Tiny bee, thou honey-birdling,<br> Lord of all the forest flowers,<br> Fly away and gather honey,<br> Bring to me the forest-sweetness,<br> Found in Metsola's rich gardens,<br> And in Tapio's fragrant meadows,<br> From the petals of the flowers,<br> From the blooming herbs and grasses,<br> Thus to heal my hero's anguish,<br> Thus to heal his wounds of evil."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the honey-birdling<br> Flies away on wings of swiftness,<br> Into Metsola's rich gardens,<br> Into Tapio's flowery meadows,<br> Gathers sweetness from the meadows,<br> With the tongue distills the honey<br> From the cups of seven flowers,<br> From the bloom of countless grasses;<br> Quick from Metsola returning,<br> Flying, humming darting onward,<br> With his winglets honey-laden,<br> With the store of sweetest odors,<br> To the mother brings the balsam.<br> Lemminkainen's anxious mother<br> Takes the balm of magic virtues,<br> And anoints the injured hero,<br> Heals his wounds and stills his anguish;<br> But the balm is inefficient,<br> For her son is deaf and speechless.</p> 
<p>Then again out-speaks the mother:<br> Lemminkainen's Restoration.<br> "Little bee, my honey-birdling,<br> Fly away in one direction,<br> Fly across the seven oceans,<br> In the eighth, a magic island,<br> Where the honey is enchanted,<br> To the distant Turi-castles,<br> To the chambers of Palwoinen;<br> There the honey is effective,<br> There, the wonder-working balsam,<br> This may heal the wounded hero;<br> Bring me of this magic ointment,<br> That I may anoint his eyelids,<br> May restore his injured senses."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the honey-birdling<br> Flew away o'er seven oceans,<br> To the old enchanted island;<br> Flies one day, and then a second,<br> On the verdure does not settle,<br> Does not rest upon the flowers;<br> Flies a third day, fleetly onward,<br> Till a third day evening brings him<br> To the island in the ocean,<br> To the meadows rich in honey,<br> To the cataract and fire-flow,<br> To the sacred stream and whirlpool.</p> 
<p>There the honey was preparing,<br> There the magic balm distilling<br> In the tiny earthen vessels,<br> In the burnished copper kettles,<br> Smaller than a maiden's thimble,<br> Smaller than the tips of fingers.<br> Faithfully the busy insect<br> Gathers the enchanted honey<br> From the magic Turi-cuplets<br> In the chambers of Palwoinen.</p> 
<p>Time had gone but little distance,<br> Ere the bee came loudly humming<br> Flying fleetly, honey-laden;<br> In his arms were seven vessels,<br> Seven, the vessels on each shoulder;<br> All were filled with honey-balsam,<br> With the balm of magic virtues.</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen's tireless mother<br> Quick anoints her speechless hero,<br> With the magic Turi-balsam,<br> With the balm of seven virtues;<br> Nine the times that she anoints him<br> With the honey of Palwoinen,<br> With the wonder-working balsam;<br> But the balm is inefficient,<br> For the hero still is speechless.<br> Then again out-speaks the mother:<br> "Honey-bee, thou ether birdling,<br> Fly a third time on thy journey,<br> Fly away to high Jumala,<br> Fly thou to the seventh heaven,<br> Honey there thou'lt find abundant,<br> Balsam of the highest virtue,<br> Only used by the Creator,<br> Only made from the breath of Ukko.<br> God anoints his faithful children,<br> With the honey of his wisdom,<br> When they feel the pangs of sorrow,<br> When they meet the powers of evil.<br> Dip thy winglets in this honey,<br> Steep thy plumage in His sweetness,<br> Hither bring the all-sufficient<br> Balsam of the great Creator;<br> This will still my hero's anguish,<br> This will heal his wounded tissues,<br> This restore his long-lost vision,<br> Make the Northland hills re-echo<br> With the magic of his singing,<br> With his wonderful enchantment."<br> Thus the honey-bee made answer:<br> "I can never fly to heaven,<br> To the seventh of the heavens,<br> To the distant home of Ukko,<br> With these wings of little virtue."<br> Lemminkainen's mother answered:<br> "Thou canst surely fly to heaven,<br> To the seventh of the heavens,<br> O'er the Moon, beneath the sunshine,<br> Through the dim and distant starlight.<br> On the first day, flying upward,<br> Thou wilt near the Moon in heaven,<br> Fan the brow of Kootamoinen;<br> On the second thou canst rest thee<br> On the shoulders of Otava;<br> On the third day, flying higher,<br> Rest upon the seven starlets,<br> On the heads of Hetewan&egrave;;<br> Short the journey that is left thee,<br> Inconsiderable the distance<br> To the home of mighty Ukko,<br> To the dwellings of the blessed."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the bee arising,<br> From the earth flies swiftly upward,<br> Hastens on with graceful motion,<br> By his tiny wings borne heavenward,<br> In the paths of golden moonbeams,<br> Touches on the Moon's bright borders,<br> Fans the brow of Kootamoinen,<br> Rests upon Otava's shoulders,<br> Hastens to the seven starlets.,<br> To the heads of Hetewan&egrave;,<br> Flies to the Creator's castle,<br> To the home of generous Ukko,<br> Finds the remedy preparing,<br> Finds the balm of life distilling,<br> In the silver-tinted caldrons,<br> In the purest golden kettles;<br> On one side, heart-easing honey,<br> On a second, balm of joyance,<br> On the third, life-giving balsam.<br> Here the magic bee, selecting,<br> Culls the sweet, life-giving balsam,<br> Gathers too, heart-easing honey,<br> Heavy-laden hastens homeward.</p> 
<p>Time had traveled little distance,<br> Ere the busy bee came humming<br> To the anxious mother waiting,<br> In his arms a hundred cuplets,<br> And a thousand other vessels,<br> Filled with honey, filled with balsam,<br> Filled with the balm of the Creator.</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen's mother quickly<br> Takes them on her, tongue and tests them,<br> Finds a balsam all-sufficient.<br> Then the mother spake as follows:<br> "I have found the long-sought balsam,<br> Found the remedy of Ukko,<br> Where-with God anoints his people,<br> Gives them life, and faith, and wisdom,<br> Heals their wounds and stills their anguish,<br> Makes them strong against temptation,<br> Guards them from the evil-doers."</p> 
<p>Now the mother well anointing,<br> Heals her son, the magic singer,<br> Eyes, and ears, and tongue, and temples,<br> Breaks, and cuts, and seams, anointing,<br> Touching well the life-blood centres,<br> Speaks these words of magic import<br> To the sleeping Lemminkainen:<br> "Wake, arise from out thy slumber,<br> From the worst of low conditions,<br> From thy state of dire misfortune!"</p> 
<p>Slowly wakes the son and hero,<br> Rises from the depths of slumber,<br> Speaks again in magic accents,<br> These the first words of the singer:<br> "Long, indeed, have I been sleeping,<br> Long unconscious of existence,<br> But my sleep was full of sweetness,<br> Sweet the sleep in Tuonela,<br> Knowing neither joy nor sorrow!"<br> This the answer of his mother:<br> "Longer still thou wouldst have slumbered,<br> Were it not for me, thy, mother;<br> Tell me now, my son beloved,<br> Tell me that I well may hear thee,<br> Who enticed thee to Manala,<br> To the river of Tuoni,<br> To the fatal stream and whirlpool?"</p> 
<p>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Gave this answer to his mother:<br> "Nasshut, the decrepit shepherd<br> Of the flocks of Sariola,<br> Blind, and halt, and poor, and wretched,<br> And to whom I did a favor;<br> From the slumber-land of envy<br> Nasshut sent me to Manala,<br> To the river of Tuoni;<br> Sent a serpent from the waters,<br> Sent an adder from the death-stream,<br> Through the heart of Lemminkainen;<br> Did not recognize the serpent,<br> Could not speak the serpent-language,<br> Did not know the sting of adders."<br> Spake again the ancient mother:<br> "O thou son of little insight,<br> Senseless hero, fool-magician,<br> Thou didst boast betimes thy magic<br> To enchant the wise enchanters,<br> On the dismal shores of Lapland,<br> Thou didst think to banish heroes,<br> From the borders of Pohyola;<br> Didst not know the sting of serpents,<br> Didst not know the reed of waters,<br> Nor the magic word-protector!<br> Learn the origin of serpents,<br> Whence the poison of the adder.</p> 
<p>"In the floods was born the serpent,<br> From the marrow of the gray-duck,<br> From the brain of ocean-swallows;<br> Suoyatar had made saliva,<br> Cast it on the waves of ocean,<br> Currents drove it outward, onward,<br> Softly shone the sun upon it,<br> By the winds 'twas gently cradled,<br> Gently nursed by winds and waters,<br> By the waves was driven shoreward,<br> Landed by the surging billows.<br> Thus the serpent, thing of evil,<br> Filling all the world with trouble,<br> Was created in the waters<br> Born from Suoyatar, its maker."</p> 
<p>Then the mother of the hero<br> Rocked her son to rest and comfort,<br> Rocked him to his former being,<br> To his former life and spirit,<br> Into greater magic powers;<br> Wiser, handsomer than ever<br> Grew the hero of the islands;<br> But his heart was full of trouble,<br> And his mother, ever watchful,<br> Asked the cause of his dejection.<br> This is Lemminkainen's answer:<br> "This the cause of all my sorrow;<br> Far away my heart is roaming,<br> All my thoughts forever wander<br> To the Northland's blooming virgins,<br> To the maids of braided tresses.<br> Northland's ugly hostess, Louhi,<br> Will not give to me her daughter,<br> Fairest maiden of Pohyola,<br> Till I kill the swan of Mana,<br> With my bow and but one arrow,<br> In the river of Tuoni.<br> Lemminkainen's mother answers,<br> In the sacred stream and whirlpool.<br> "Let the swan swim on in safety,<br> Give the water-bird his freedom,<br> In the river of Manala,<br> In the whirlpool of Tuoni;<br> Leave the maiden in the Northland.,<br> With her charms and fading beauty;<br> With thy fond and faithful mother,<br> Go at once to Kalevala,<br> To thy native fields and fallows.<br> Praise thy fortune, all sufficient,<br> Praise, above all else, thy Maker.<br> Ukko gave thee aid when needed,<br> Thou wert saved by thy Creator,<br> From thy long and hopeless slumber,<br> In the waters of Tuoni,<br> In the chambers of Manala.<br> I unaided could not save thee,<br> Could not give the least assistance;<br> God alone, omniscient Ukko,<br> First and last of the creators,<br> Can revive the dead and dying,<br> Can protect his worthy people<br> From the waters of Manala, .<br> From the fatal stream and whirlpool,<br> In the kingdom of Tuoni."</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen, filled with wisdom,<br> With his fond and faithful mother,<br> Hastened straightway on his journey<br> To his distant home and kindred,<br> To the Wainola fields and meadows,<br> To the plains of Kalevala.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> 
<p>Here I leave my Kaukomieli,<br> Leave my hero Lemminkainen,<br> Long I leave him from my singing,<br> Turn my song to other heroes,<br> Send it forth on other pathways,<br> Sing some other golden legend.</p>
