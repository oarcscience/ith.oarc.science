<p>I HAVE brought young Kaukomieli,<br> Brought the Islander and hero,<br> Also known as Lemminkainen,<br> Through the jaws of death and ruin,<br> Through the darkling deeps of Kalma,<br> To the homesteads of Pohyola,<br> To the dismal courts of Louhi;<br> Now must I relate his doings,<br> Must relate to all my bearers,<br> How the merry Lemminkainen,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Wandered through Pohyola's chambers,<br> Through the halls of Sariola,<br> How the hero went unbidden<br> To the feasting and carousal,<br> Uninvited to the banquet.</p> 
<p>Lemminkainen full of courage,<br> Full of life, and strength, and magic.<br> Stepped across the ancient threshold,<br> To the centre of the court-room,<br> And the floors of linwood trembled,<br> Walls and ceilings creaked and murmured.</p> 
<p>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br> These the words that Ahti uttered:<br> "Be ye greeted on my coming,<br> Ye that greet, be likewise greeted!<br> Listen, all ye hosts of Pohya;<br> Is there food about this homestead,<br> Barley for my hungry courser,<br> Beer to give a thirsty stranger?</p> 
<p>Sat the host of Sariola<br> At the east end of the table,<br> Gave this answer to the questions:<br> "Surely is there in this homestead,<br> For thy steed an open stable,<br> Never will this host refuse thee,<br> Shouldst thou act a part becoming,<br> Worthy, coming to these portals,<br> Waiting near the birchen rafters,<br> In the spaces by the kettles,<br> By the triple hooks of iron."</p> 
<p>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<br> Shook his sable locks and answered:<br> "Lempo may perchance come hither,<br> Let him fill this lowly station,<br> Let him stand between the kettles,<br> That with soot he may be blackened.<br> Never has my ancient father,<br> Never has the dear old hero,<br> Stood upon a spot unworthy,<br> At the portals near the rafters;<br> For his steed the best of stables,<br> Food and shelter gladly furnished,<br> And a room for his attendants,<br> Corners furnished for his mittens,<br> Hooks provided for his snow-shoes,<br> Halls in waiting for his helmet.<br> Wherefore then should I not find here<br> What my father found before me?"</p> 
<p>To the centre walked the hero,<br> Walked around the dining table,<br> Sat upon a bench and waited,<br> On a bench of polished fir-wood,<br> And the kettle creaked beneath him.<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "As a guest am I unwelcome,<br> Since the waiters bring no viands,<br> Bring no dishes to the stranger?"</p> 
<p>Ilpotar, the Northland hostess,<br> Then addressed the words that follow:<br> "Lemminkainen, thou art evil,<br> Thou art here, but not invited,<br> Thou hast not the look of kindness,<br> Thou wilt give me throbbing temples,<br> Thou art bringing pain and sorrow.<br> All our beer is in the barley,<br> All the malt is in the kernel,<br> All our grain is still ungarnered,<br> And our dinner has been eaten;<br> Yesterday thou shouldst have been here,<br> Come again some future season."</p> 
<p>Whereupon wild Lemminkainen<br> Pulled his mouth awry in anger,<br> Shook his coal-black locks and answered:<br> "All the tables here are empty,<br> And the feasting-time is over;<br> All the beer has left the goblets,<br> Empty too are all the pitchers,<br> Empty are the larger vessels.<br> O thou hostess of Pohyola,<br> Toothless dame of dismal Northland,<br> Badly managed is thy wedding,<br> And thy feast is ill-conducted,<br> Like the dogs hast thou invited;<br> Thou hast baked the honey-biscuit,<br> Wheaten loaves of greatest virtue,<br> Brewed thy beer from hops and barley,<br> Sent abroad thine invitations,<br> Six the hamlets thou hast honored,<br> Nine the villages invited<br> By thy merry wedding-callers.<br> Thou hast asked the poor and lowly,<br> Asked the hosts of common people,<br> Asked the blind, and deaf, and crippled,<br> Asked a multitude of beggars,<br> Toilers by the day, and hirelings;<br> Asked the men of evil habits,<br> Asked the maids with braided tresses,<br> I alone was not invited.<br> How could such a slight be given,<br> Since I sent thee kegs of barley?<br> Others sent thee grain in cupfuls,<br> Brought it sparingly in dippers,<br> While I sent thee fullest measure,<br> Sent the half of all my garners,<br> Of the richest of my harvest,<br> Of the grain that I had gathered.<br> Even now young Lemminkainen,<br> Though a guest of name and station<br> Has no beer, no food, no welcome,<br> Naught for him art thou preparing,<br> Nothing cooking in thy kettles,<br> Nothing brewing in thy cellars<br> For the hero of the Islands,<br> At the closing of his journey."</p> 
<p>Ilpotar, the ancient hostess,<br> Gave this order to her servants:<br> "Come, my pretty maiden-waiter,<br> Servant-girl to me belonging,<br> Lay some salmon to the broiling,<br> Bring some beer to give the stranger!"</p> 
<p>Small of stature was the maiden,<br> Washer of the banquet-platters,<br> Rinser of the dinner-ladles,<br> Polisher of spoons of silver,<br> And she laid some food in kettles,<br> Only bones and beads of whiting,<br> Turnip-stalks and withered cabbage,<br> Crusts of bread and bits of biscuit.<br> Then she brought some beer in pitchers,<br> Brought of common drink the vilest,<br> That the stranger, Lemminkainen,<br> Might have drink, and meat in welcome,<br> Thus to still his thirst and hunger.<br> Then the maiden spake as follows:<br> "Thou art sure a mighty hero,<br> Here to drink the beer of Pohya,<br> Here to empty all our vessels!"</p> 
<p>Then the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<br> Closely handled all the pitchers,<br> Looking to the very bottoms;<br> There beheld he writhing serpents,<br> In the centre adders swimming,<br> On the borders worms and lizards.<br> Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<br> Filled with anger, spake as follows:<br> Get ye hence, ye things of evil,<br> Get ye hence to Tuonela,<br> With the bearer of these pitchers,<br> With the maid that brought ye hither,<br> Ere the evening moon has risen,<br> Ere the day-star seeks the ocean!<br> 0 thou wretched beer of barley,<br> Thou hast met with great dishonor,<br> Into disrepute hast fallen,<br> But I'll drink thee, notwithstanding,<br> And the rubbish cast far from me."</p> 
<p>Then the hero to his pockets<br> Thrust his first and unnamed finger,<br> Searching in his pouch of leather;<br> Quick withdraws a hook for fishing,<br> Drops it to the pitcher's bottom,<br> Through the worthless beer of barley;<br> On his fish-book hang the serpents,<br> Catches many hissing adders,<br> Catches frogs in magic numbers,<br> Catches blackened worms in thousands,<br> Casts them to the floor before him,<br> Quickly draws his heavy broad sword,<br> And decapitates the serpents.</p> 
<p>Now he drinks the beer remaining,<br> When the wizard speaks as follows:<br> "As a guest am I unwelcome,<br> Since no beer to me is given<br> That is worthy of a hero;<br> Neither has a ram been butchered,<br> Nor a fattened calf been slaughtered,<br> Worthy food for Lemminkainen."</p> 
<p>Then the landlord of Pohyola<br> Answered thus the Island-minstrel:<br> "Wherefore hast thou journeyed hither,<br> Who has asked thee for thy presence?<br> Spake in answer Lemminkainen:<br> "Happy is the guest invited,<br> Happier when not expected;<br> Listen, son of Pohylander,<br> Host of Sariola, listen:<br> Give me beer for ready payment,<br> Give me worthy drink for money!"</p> 
<p>Then the landlord of Pohyola,<br> In bad humor, full of anger,<br> Conjured in the earth a lakelet,<br> At the feet of Kaukomieli,<br> Thus addressed the Island-hero:<br> "Quench thy thirst from yonder lakelet,<br> There, the beer that thou deservest!"</p> 
<p>Little heeding, Lemminkainen<br> To this insolence made answer:<br> "I am neither bear nor roebuck,<br> That should drink this filthy water,<br> Drink the water of this lakelet."</p> 
<p>Ahti then began to conjure,<br> Conjured he a bull before him,<br> Bull with horns of gold and silver,<br> And the bull drank from the lakelet,<br> Drank he from the pool in pleasure.<br> Then the landlord of Pohyola<br> There a savage wolf created,<br> Set him on the floor before him<br> To destroy the bull of magic,<br> Lemminkainen, full of courage,<br> Conjured up a snow-white rabbit,<br> Set him on the floor before him<br> To attract the wolf's attention.<br> Then the landlord of Pohyola<br> Conjured there a dog of Lempo,<br> Set him on the floor before him<br> To destroy the magic rabbit.<br> Lemminkainen, full of mischief,<br> Conjured on the roof a squirrel,<br> That by jumping on the rafters<br> He might catch the dog's attention.<br> But the master of the Northland<br> Conjured there a golden marten,<br> And he drove the magic squirrel<br> From his seat upon the rafters.<br> Lemminkainen, full of mischief,<br> Made a fox of scarlet color,<br> And it ate the golden marten.<br> Then the master of Pohyola<br> Conjured there a hen to flutter<br> Near the fox of scarlet color.<br> Lemminkainen, full of mischief,<br> Thereupon a hawk created,<br> That with beak and crooked talons<br> He might tear the hen to pieces.</p> 
<p>Spake the landlord of Pohyola,<br> These the words the tall man uttered:<br> "Never will this feast be bettered<br> Till the guests are less in number;<br> I must do my work as landlord,<br> Get thee hence, thou evil stranger,<br> Cease thy conjurings of evil,<br> Leave this banquet of my people,<br> Haste away, thou wicked wizard,<br> To thine Island-home and people!<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<br> "Thus no hero will be driven,<br> Not a son of any courage<br> Will be frightened by thy presence,<br> Will be driven from thy banquet."</p> 
<p>Then the landlord of Pohyola<br> Snatched his broadsword from the rafters,<br> Drew it rashly from the scabbard,<br> Thus addressing Lemminkainen:<br> "Ahti, Islander of evil,<br> Thou the handsome Kaukomieli,<br> Let us measure then our broadswords,<br> Let our skill be fully tested;<br> Surely is my broadsword better<br> Than the blade within thy scabbard."<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen.<br> "That my blade is good and trusty,<br> Has been proved on heads of heroes,<br> Has on many bones been tested;<br> Be that as it may, my fellow,<br> Since thine order is commanding,<br> Let our swords be fully tested,<br> Let us see whose blade is better.<br> Long ago my hero-father<br> Tested well this sword in battle,<br> Never failing in a conflict.<br> Should his son be found less worthy?"</p> 
<p>Then he grasped his mighty broadsword,<br> Drew the fire-blade from the scabbard<br> Hanging from his belt of copper.<br> Standing on their hilts their broadswords,<br> Carefully their blades were measured,<br> Found the sword of Northland's master<br> Longer than the sword of Ahti<br> By the half-link of a finger.<br> Spake the reckless Lemminkainen.<br> "Since thou hast the longer broadsword,<br> Thou shalt make the first advances,<br> I am ready for thy weapon."</p> 
<p>Thereupon Pohyola's landlord<br> With the wondrous strength of anger,<br> Tried in vain to slay the hero,<br> Strike the crown of Lemminkainen;<br> Chipped the splinters from the rafters,<br> Cut the ceiling into fragments,<br> Could not touch the Island-hero.</p> 
<p>Thereupon brave Kaukomieli,<br> Thus addressed Pohyola's master:<br> "Have the rafters thee offended?<br> What the crimes they have committed,<br> Since thou hewest them in pieces?<br> Listen now, thou host of Northland,<br> Reckless landlord of Pohyola,<br> Little room there is for swordsmen<br> In these chambers filled with women;<br> We shall stain these painted rafters,<br> Stain with blood these floors and ceilings;<br> Let us go without the mansion,<br> In the field is room for combat,<br> On the plain is space sufficient;<br> Blood looks fairer in the court-yard,<br> Better in the open spaces,<br> Let it dye the snow-fields scarlet."</p> 
<p>To the yard the heroes hasten,<br> There they find a monstrous ox-skin,<br> Spread it on the field of battle;<br> On the ox-skin stand the swordsmen.<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "Listen well, thou host of Northland,<br> Though thy broadsword is the longer,<br> Though thy blade is full of horror,<br> Thou shalt have the first advantage;<br> Use with skill thy boasted broadsword<br> Ere the final bout is given,<br> Ere thy head be chopped in pieces;<br> Strike with skill, or thou wilt perish,<br> Strike, and do thy best for Northland."</p> 
<p>Thereupon Pohyola's landlord<br> Raised on high his blade of battle,<br> Struck a heavy blow in anger,<br> Struck a second, then a third time,<br> But he could not touch his rival,<br> Could Dot draw a single blood-drop<br> From the veins of Lemminkainen,<br> Skillful Islander and hero.<br> Spake the handsome Kaukomieli:<br> "Let me try my skill at fencing,<br> Let me swing my father's broadsword,<br> Let my honored blade be tested!"<br> But the landlord of Pohyola,<br> Does not heed the words of Ahti,<br> Strikes in fury, strikes unceasing,<br> Ever aiming, ever missing.<br> When the skillful Lemminkainen<br> Swings his mighty blade of magic,<br> Fire disports along his weapon,<br> Flashes from his sword of honor,<br> Glistens from the hero's broadsword,<br> Balls of fire disporting, dancing,<br> On the blade of mighty Ahti,<br> Overflow upon the shoulders<br> Of the landlord of Pohyola.<br> Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<br> "O thou son of Sariola,<br> See! indeed thy neck is glowing<br> Like the dawning of the morning,<br> Like the rising Sun in ocean!"</p> 
<p>Quickly turned Pohyola's landlord,<br> Thoughtless host of darksome Northland,<br> To behold the fiery splendor<br> Playing on his neck and shoulders.<br> Quick as lightning, Lemminkainen,<br> With his father's blade of battle,<br> With a single blow of broadsword,<br> With united skill and power,<br> Lopped the head of Pohya's master;<br> As one cleaves the stalks of turnips,<br> As the ear falls from the corn-stalk,<br> As one strikes the fins from salmon,<br> Thus the head rolled from the shoulders<br> Of the landlord of Pohyola,<br> Like a ball it rolled and circled.</p> 
<p>In the yard were pickets standing,<br> Hundreds were the sharpened pillars,<br> And a head on every picket,<br> Only one was left un-headed.<br> Quick the victor, Lemminkainen,<br> Took the head of Pohya's landlord,<br> Spiked it on the empty picket.</p> 
<p>Then the Islander, rejoicing,<br> Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<br> Quick returning to the chambers,<br> Crave this order to the hostess:<br> "Evil maiden, bring me water,<br> Wherewithal to cleanse my fingers<br> From the blood of Northland's master,<br> Wicked host of Sariola."</p> 
<p>Ilpotar, the Northland hostess,<br> Fired with anger, threatened vengeance,<br> Conjured men with heavy broadswords,<br> Heroes clad in copper-armor,<br> Hundred warriors with their javelins,<br> And a thousand bearing cross-bows,<br> To destroy the Island-hero,<br> For the death of Lemminkainen.<br> Kaukomieli soon discovered<br> That the time had come for leaving,<br> That his presence was unwelcome<br> At the feasting of Pohyola,<br> At the banquet of her people.</p>
