<P>1. The Unwelcome Guest.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Heard by J. F. C. about twenty or twenty-five years ago, in Islay. A man invites a skull to dinner, it comes as an old man, and is frightened away by a particular arrangement of bannocks. I have seen a similar story, but cannot name the book.--D. D.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>2. Donald Duval Mackay. (?Devil).</P><DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">(This is to be found in the manuscript from the Highland Society of Scotland: attributed, I think, to Fingal.)</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>6. The Fairy asking about his chance of Salvation.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This, or something like it, is in "Croker's Irish Stories," and in the "Popular Superstitions of the Highlands," in Grant Stewart's, and seems to shew that the Fairies are the old Pagans, probably those who made the Fairy arrow heads.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>7. The Man who flew with the Fairies.</P>
<P>8. A Water Spirit "<I>Vougha</I>," translated Kelpie.</P><DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">No.</FONT></P>

</DIR>

<P>11. A Second-sight Warning of Death, and the Ghost.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is like some in Grant Stewart's collection.</FONT></P></DIR>

</DIR>

<P>13. A Morayshire Legend of a Castle that sunk into the earth, and is still to be seen at the bottom of a lake.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This has many foreign relations. The origin of the tradition is perhaps to be traced to the destruction of the cities of the plain.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>14. The Rotterdam.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A large ship sunk with the crew still alive. The Folge Fond, in Norway, is said to cover seven parishes which were overwhelmed for their wickedness, by the snow and ice. The church bells may still be heard ringing under the ice, and the people will some day be restored to the world.--J. F. C., 1857.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>15. A Legend of Loch Spynie.</P><DIR>

<P>20. The Jewel of Ben Stack.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Common in Argyllshire.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>21. The Erse version of Jack the Giant Killer.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">It resembles the Norse--It is the best of the collection.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>22. Superstitions--Instance of:--Gamekeeper.</P>
<P>23. The Sea, and drowned and murdered people.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In Iceland it is a custom to open the Bible by chance to find out the result of some undertaking. I tried it, and it came right, in 1861.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>37., 38., 39. Instances of Voghes being seen. Fuath is the Gaelic word.</P><DIR>

<P>42. The Lord's Prayer a protection against evil.</P>

</DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">No.</FONT></P>
<P>45. A Rhyme.</P>

</DIR>

<P>57. The Death of Sweno.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is probably the tradition of a fact in the history of Norse invasions--I know nothing quite like it.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>58. The Dun Otter, called Doar-chu.</P>
<P>59. Why the Wolf is stumpy tailed.</P><DIR>

</DIR>

<P>61. The Dragon of Loch Corrie Mor.</P>
<P>62. The Dragons of Loch Merkland.</P>
<P>63. The Stupid Boy.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is known in Ross and in Argyllshire. It is one of the Highland stories, and, so far as I know, has never been published. There is more of it which should not be inquired for. I have two Gaelic versions, got elsewhere.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P><A NAME="page_383"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 383</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">No.</FONT></P>
<P>64. The Unjust Sentence.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Very good. It has a resemblance to a tale in the Arabian Nights, but I do not think it is taken from that source.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>65. Lauchlin, Dhumor, and the Witch.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I know nothing quite like this.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>66. The Sleeping Giants.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is known all over the United Kingdom, in all manner of shapes. It has come to me from four or five quarters, and this differs from the rest.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>67. The Giant in Barra.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This also is well known, and belongs to British Mythology.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>68. The Vaugh, the Poacher, and the Dog. (FUATH).</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">I have something like this from Barra.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>69. The Vaugh of the Laxford.</P>
<P>70. Something about a Mermaid.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is common in Germany, in Ireland, in Islay, and elsewhere, in all sorts of shapes. Some noble family, I forget which, claims to be descended from the mermaid. Thomas the Rhymer is said to have been the son of the mermaid.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>71. The Caillach Mhor of Clibreck.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This tale looks very like a recollection of the Lapps and their deer.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>72. The Mhor Bhain.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is probably a tradition of a Witch trial.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>73. Fach Mor.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is one of the Gaelic Legends which seem to have been almost forgotten on the east coast of Scotland, and which are well known in the west. It is an extraordinary jumble of everything,--King Arthur, Thor in Norse Mythology, Theseus, Hercules, Circe, and the Bible, may all be traced; and yet, when this tale was told, it probably contained traits which proved it to be a native of Sutherland, as those which come from the Islands prove themselves to be islanders. There are plenty of these tales in Gaelic MSS.; their origin is worth searching out.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>74. The Callach Mhor. Vol. II., XXVII.</P>
<P>75. A Badenoch Fairy.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is told in Norway; I remember to have read it in a Norse book, at a station, while waiting for horses.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>88. Farquar the Physician Vol. II., XLVII.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">A version of this is given in Chambers' Nursery Rhymes; it is told in Islay, well known in Mull. The man was Beaton, physician to a Scotch king, I think James VI. His MSS. are preserved in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh. The story is in Norway, in an old MS., and may be traced in the story of &AElig;sculapius.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>89. The Fox and the Cock and Hen Vol. I., XVII<I>a</I>.</P>
<P>90. The Fox and the Goose Vol. I., XVII<I>a</I>.</P>
<P>91. The Last Giant.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">This is like a published tale found in Ireland; like two versions heard in Uist by J. F. C., and one written down in Barra. It is probably founded on the MS. of the dialogue of Ossian and St. Patrick, or on something still older. The birds are generally deer. The word which means Black Bird in Gaelic may also mean <I>Black Elk</I>.</FONT></P></DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">167. A regular heroic Highland play, written by John Clerk, gamekeeper to the Duke of Argyll, at Roseneath. I have never heard a tale so told by an old man, but they are very dramatic, and this is probably an old <I>sgeulachd</I> dramatized by a gamekeeper. If John Clerk had been Shakespear, this would have become a play; if MacPherson, it would have taken the form of an Epic poem. It is curious as showing the growth of a popular tale.</FONT></P></DIR>

<P>358.-366.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Eight stories told by William and Soloman Johns, two gipsy tinkers picked up in London. They came to the office after hours, and were treated to beer and tobacco. Present--the author of Norse Tales. They were rather hard to start, but when once set agoing they were fluent. One brother was very proud of the other, who plays the fiddle by ear, and is commonly sent for to wakes, where he entertains the company with stories. He gave us, 1. A ghost, which appeared to himself. Finding that he was on the wrong track, told him a popular tale which I had got from another tinker in London, "The Cutler and Tinker." Got 2. "The lad and the dancing pigs." This is the same as the "Mouse and Bee," and has something of Hacon Grizzlebeard. A version of it was told to me by Donald MacPhie in South Uist. It is one of the few indecent stories which I have <A NAME="page_397"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 397</FONT></A> heard in the Highlands. There are adventures with a horse, a lion, and a fox, which the London tinker had not got. It savours of the wit which is to be found in Straparola.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>3. A sailor and others, by the help of a magic blackthorn stick, go to three castles under ground, copper, silver, and gold, and win three princesses. Same as, "the king of Lochlin's daughters," and "the knight of Grianaig," and several stories in Norse Tales and Grimm.</P>
<P>4. "The five hunchbacks." This story was quite new to both of us, but a version of it was subsequently found in a book of Cruickshank's. The tinker's version was much better.</P>
<P>5. A long and very well told story of a Jew, in which there figured a magic strap, hat, etc., same as Big and Little Peter, Eoghan Iuarach; a story in Straparola, etc.</P>
<P>6. The art of doctoring--dirty wit.</P>
<P>7. Poor student and black man travel--dig up dead woman--make fire in church--steal sheep--clerk--parson--take black man for fiend and bolt. Very well told. See Goosey Grizzle and several Gaelic versions.</P>
<P>8. Poor student, parson, and man, with cat, which was the fiend in disguise. Well told; new to both us.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The men said that they knew a great many more; that they could neither read nor write; that they picked these up at wakes and other meetings, where such tales are commonly told in England now.</FONT></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>368. A lot of notes collected in September, 1860, during a trip to Glenquoich, Skye, Uist, Barra, etc.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_398"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 398</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">No.</FONT></P>
<P>Many of these are preserved as notes in an interleaved copy of West Highland Tales (vols. i. ii.) Notes of a dinner given at Inverary to Dewar, Macnair, Gillies, Mackenzie, The Miller, The Tinker, and others (Mr. Robertson present); the whole party told stories, and parted quietly and soberly at midnight exactly, on Saturday night. Under this number are included some fifty or sixty long stories, some of which were not written down.</P>
<P>369. Letter from Mr. Fraser of Mauld, August 2, 1861, mentioning a lad who knows a great many stories, 1. Magnus MacRigh na Albain (a long one). 2. An t-Uirsgeul Mor (a very long one), <I>of this I have several version</I>s. 3. Finn M&#145;Cuile (probably a Fenian legend). 4. Caileach Uileam dean suidhe (a short one), <I>probably a story which I know well, about William sit down</I>, which is in Norse in another shape.</P>
<P>370. Collection sent by the Rev. THOMAS PATTIESON, (letter).</P>
<P>371. 1. From a native of Islay who lives in Glasgow, a story of a man who is beset by a female water-spirit. This is curious, because it was told me by an Irish carman at Waterford. The locality and some details altered. A stallion overcame the Islay sprite, and a big dog finished her. Good.</P>
<P>372. A story of fairies stealing a man's whisky, and the man himself. A very good fairy tale.</P>
<P>373. Glenastil water-horses ridden to market. A good instance of this popular belief.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_399"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 399</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">No.</FONT></P>
<P>374. A dialogue between a woman and a fairy in Gaelic, like the spirit of many popular tales. Ready answers.</P>
<P>375. Letter, December 24, 1860, about LACHLAN M<FONT SIZE="-1">AC</FONT>NEIL, who told a number of capital stories; he is a shoemaker and fiddler, and lives in Paisley.</P>
<P>376. A Fairy Changeling, very well told, traced back for three generations.</P>
<P>377. Ard na h-uamh loch--Water-horses--dun coloured.--ridden to market--torn to pieces by the rest on his return. Water bulls, said to be now extinct, but to have existed long ago.</P>
<P>378. See 371.</P>
<P>379. Iain Ciar, Dun John of Dunolly. Popular history; a very good legend, of a very old date. The hero is outlawed, and gains his pardon by bringing the head of a robber from Ireland to London to the king. The narrator added that in these days the kings lived a good deal at York, and he was not sure if the head went to London or to York.</P>
<P>380. Sgeul Alastair Arranach, A bit of popular history, wild and well told.</P>
<P>381. A Legend of the Island in the Rhinns of Islay.</P>
<P>382. Supernatural history, water-bulls, etc, as described by the people.</P>
<P>383. Bull fights water-horses. Nearly the same as a story got from Kilberry.</P>
<P>384. The origin of the name Cnoc Angil (in Islay). The Feinne appear in this, and an old woman who runs off with their arms.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_400"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 400</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">No.</FONT></P>
<P>385. Appearance of a mysterious personage on Laggan Sand.</P>
<P>386. A legend of a stream near Bowmore. A goblin appears to some wrecked sailors as a pig, a wolf, an old woman, and a ball of fire (letter, January 28, 1861).</P>
<P>387. Collection sent December 3, 1860. 1. Taoghairm; a man raises the fiend and challenges all that are dead or alive in the sea to fight. He is saved by women who are making <I>Tein' &eacute;igin</I>, forced fire.</P>
<P>388. The legend which is told of Cawdor Castle: A man builds his house where an ass's tether breaks, and prospers; he goes to a bridge, and is there told that where the peg of the ass's tether is fixed there is a pot of gold. The old thorn tree where the man stopped stands in a cellar at Cawdor Castle. In this the man's name is "Coinneach br&agrave;th na br&agrave;thin," and the place is not named.</P>
<P>389. A shoemaker flies to London from Coleraine. (I don't know this legend).</P>
<P>390. The Doideag Mhuileach's daughter, Mogan Dubh and her son. A legend of witchcraft and flying through the air to steal. (Very popular).</P>
<P>391. A woman and a frog. There is something like this in the Mabinogion told of a mouse, but the Welsh story is very long.</P>
<P>392. A smuggler sees a lot of little people about as big as a bottle, with teeth as long as his finger. Fairies? or Lusbirdean.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_401"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 401</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">No.</FONT></P>
<P>393 to 402. A lot of stories got from a carman in Waterford in 1861, included--1. The water-cow and her progeny. 2. The Bansithe, which the narrator "had seen and heard." 3. A version of the man who travelled to learn shivering. 4. A haunted tower. 5. Treasure finding. 6. A spirit haunting a road and asking for a ride. 7. A lake spirit. 8. The man and dog in the subterranean passage, and many others were alluded to. It was evident that the Irish peasantry had the very same legends as the Scotch, and these were told in a different, and very characteristic way.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is to be hoped that some Irishman will collect and publish the Irish popular tales. If it be honestly and faithfully done it will be the most amusing collection of all; but if any one polishes the language of Irish peasants, he will most certainly spoil it.</P>
<P>I have a lot of notes scattered in note-books which would increase this number considerably. And I have heard stories told in Devonshire, near London, in Cheshire, in Ireland, in Norway, Sweden, and France. But nowhere have I found popular tales so well preserved, or in such great abundance. as in the western coasts and islands of Scotland. I have a great many notes of stories scattered through some hundreds of letters, which are not included in this list.</FONT></P></DIR>
