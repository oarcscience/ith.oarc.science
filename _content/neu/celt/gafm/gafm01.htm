<p align="CENTER">My friends, those I know and those I do not know, I am glad in the year of the birth of your Society to have this book to offer you.</p> 
<p>It has given great courage to many workers here--working to build up broken walls--to know you have such friendly thoughts of them in your minds. A few of you have already come to see us, and we begin to hope that one day the steamers across the Atlantic will not go out full, but come back full, until some of you find your real home is here, and say as some of us say, like Finn to the woman of enchantments</p> 
<p>"We would not give up our own country--Ireland--if we were to get the whole world as an estate, and the Country of the Young along with it"</p>
