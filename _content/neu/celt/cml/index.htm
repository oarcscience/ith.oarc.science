Part of the 'Myths and Legends' series published by Gresham in the early
20th century, 'Celtic Myth and Legend' is actually a reissue of a 1905
work, 'The Mythology of the British Islands'.
It differs from the rest of the Gresham series because it is a bit more
scholarly (it actually has an adequate set of footnotes)
and a bit more didactic.
There is <A HREF="cml31.htm">an extensive index</A>
with over 8,000 references (all hyperlinked here).
Another great feature is a <A HREF="cml32.htm">glossary</A> of
dozens of Irish and Welsh words and phrases
with phonetic transcriptions--finally
everyone can learn how to properly pronounce terms such as 
'T&aacute;in Bo Chuailgn&eacute;' and 'Pwyll'!
This is a good thing.
More importantly,
Squire is summarizing a (fairly mainstream)
school of thought about the mythology
of Britain, in which many names and incidents in the
tangled legends of the dark ages can be traced to ancient Pagan myths.
The Celtic fairy faith is explained as a survival of the
worship of ancient tutelary gods and goddesses.
When one considers that the other two
leading theories are that the fairies are supernatural
transdimensional entities or reclusive troglodyte pygmies, this seems
to be fairly rational.
</P>
<P>
Through the ancient chronologies of Irish invasions and the heroic
age of the Fenians, through the Welsh tales from the Mabinogion,
and into the age of Arthur, we see similar names, themes and story
elements crop up again and again.
For instance, the ancient sky-God Lludd, is confused with a sea-god,
Llyr, who eventually morphs into King Lear.
Llud's daughter Creudylad, becomes Cordelia.
The magic cauldron of ancient Celtic mythology becomes the Holy Grail.
And so on.</P>
<P>
There are many parallels to classical mythology, and
Squire uses these as reference points, e.g. by calling
the War of the Bull of Cualgne, 'The Irish Iliad,' Cuchulainn,
'The Irish Achilles,' and
Branwen, 'The British Aphrodite.'
Some of these analogies do break down on close examination,
but they can aid the reader's
absorption of this lesser-known branch of mythology.
</P>
<P>
While Squire is trying to make a point, and there is
more apparatus than the typical Gresham <I>Myths and Legends</I> book, he
also tells these timeless stories in a very entertaining fashion.
