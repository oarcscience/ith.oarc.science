# PREFACE.

This book, with the exception of parts of Chapters XVIII. and XIX., has
been gathered by myself from the mouths of the folk. Much of it I have
been in the habit of hearing and marking from my earliest years. To all
kind friends from whom I have gotten lore I give my hearty thanks. I
cannot name them all, but my thanks are specially due to Mrs. Forbes and
Mrs. Coutts, Banff; to the late Mrs. Watson, and to Mrs. Cardno,
Fraserburgh, for help in Chapters XVI. and XXIII.--"Riddles" and
"Countings-out." As to references to parallel customs elsewhere, I have
noted only those which occur in the Society's publications, and a few
very obvious instances in Russian and Italian folklore. These I thought
would assist members of the Society without altering the character of my
collection.

Pitsligo, Aberdeenshire,  
       *April*, 1881.
