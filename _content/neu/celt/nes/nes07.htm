Here is one about the face; and as the nurse repeated each line she touched with her finger the part of the face mentioned in the line:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Chin cherry,<br> Moo merry,<br> Nose nappie,<br> Ee winkie,<br> Broo brinkie,<br> Cock-up jinkie."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>There is a variation of the last line:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Our the hill ail awa&#146;."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>The following refers to the brow, the eye, the nose, and the mouth:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Knock at the doorie,<br> Peep in,<br> Lift the latch<br> An walk in."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Here is one about the fingers, beginning with the index finger:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">Here's the man it brook the barn,<br> Here's the man it staa the corn,<br> Here's the man it taul a&#146;,<br> Peer creenie-crannie paid for a&#146;."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The nurse took hold of each finger as she repeated each line. There was another form of the rhyme, in which the thumb played the part of breaking the barn:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"This is the man it brook the barn,<br> This is the man it staa the corn,<br> This is the man it taul a&#146;,<br> This the man it ran awa&#146;,<br> Peer creenie-crannie paid for a&#146;."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Another form of the last line is:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"An puir wee crannie doodlie paid for a&#146;."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>The legs and feet were utilised by the nurse as a means of amusement. Here is what she repeated while she held a leg in each hand and kept crossing them, slowly at first, and then with greater rapidity when the dogs were supposed to be on their homeward journey:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"There wiz twa doggies,<br> A ii they geed t&#146; the mill,<br> All they got a lick cot o&#146; this wife's pyock,<br> An anither oot o&#146; the neesht wife's pyock,<br> All a leb oot o&#146; the dam,<br> An syne they geed hame,<br> Loupie for loup, loupie for loup."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Another version runs thus:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">Twa doggies geed t&#146; the mill,<br> They took a lick oot o&#146; this wife's pyock,<br> An a lick oot o&#146; that wife's pyock,<br> An a leb oot o&#146; the mill dam;<br> Hame again, hame again--loupie for loup--<br> Hame again, hame again--loupie for spang."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>The following rhyme was repeated to the child by the nurse while she took off the child's boot and imitated the blacksmith in nailing the shoes on the horse's foot:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"John Smith, a fellow fine,<br> Cam t&#146; shee a horse o&#146; mine.<br> Pit a bit upo&#146; the tae,<br> T&#146; gar the horsie clim&#146; the brae;<br> Pit a bit upo&#146; the brod,<br> T&#146; gar the horsie clim&#146; the road;<br> Pit a bit upo&#146; the heel,<br> T&#146; gar the horsie trot weel."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Here is another version:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"John Smith, a fellow fine,<br> Cam t&#146; shoo a horse o&#146; mine--<br> Shoo a horse, ca&#146; a nail,<br> Ca&#146; a tackit in&#146;s tail--<br> Hand him sicker, hand him sair,<br> Haud him by the head o&#146; hair."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Another rhyme about the legs and feet is as follows:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Hey my kittin, my kittin--<br> Hey my kittin, my dearie;<br> Sic a fit as this<br> Wiz na far nor nearie.<br> Here we gae up, up, up;<br> Here we gae doon, doon, doonie;<br> Here we gae back an fore;<br> Here we gae roon an roonie;<br> Here's a leg for a stockin,<br> An here's a fit for a shoeie."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Various members of the body were celebrated in the following way:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"This is the broo o&#146; knowledge,<br> This is the ee o&#146; life.<br> This is the bibblie gauger,<br> An this is the pen-knife,<br> This is the shouther o&#146; mutton,<br> This is the lump o&#146; fat."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>The next two lines must be left untold.</p>  
<p>When the child was being fed, to keep it in good humour and induce it to take its food, the nurse kept repeating:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Sannie Kilrannie, the laird o&#146; Kailcrack,<br> Suppit kale brose, and swallit the cap."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>A fuller version of the same was:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Sandy Killrannie,<br> The laird o&#146; Kilknap,<br> He suppit kail brose<br> Till his wyme it did crack.<br> He suppit the brose<br> An swallit the speen.<br> "Ho, ho," quo&#146; Sandy,<br> The brose is deen."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When the child showed signs of being satisfied, the following words wore repeated:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Gouckit Geordie, Brig o&#146; Dee,<br> Sups the brose an leaves the bree."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>When the child was being undressed for bed, the nurse kept repeating:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Hey diddle dumplin, my son John<br> Went to his bed an his trousers on;<br> One shoe oft, an the other shoe on,<br> Hey diddle dumplin, my son John."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>When the child got into the sulks it was called:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Grinigo Gash, the laird's piper."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Children in their amusements often repeated rhymes.</p>  
<p>The following one was repeated when a child mounted a walking-stick or a piece of stick as a "horse":--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Hurple Dick upon a stick,<br> An Sandy on a soo,<br> We'll awa t&#146; Aiberdeen<br> T&#146; buy a pun o&#146; oo."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Another version is:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Cripple Dick upon a stick,<br> An Sandy on a soo,<br> Ride awa t&#146; Galloway<br> T&#146; buy a pun o&#146; oo."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>This rhyme was repeated to the child when dandled on the knee in imitation of the modes of riding indicated in the lines:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"This is the way the ladies rides,<br> Jimp an sma, jimp an sma;<br> This is the way the gentlemen rides,<br> Spurs an a&#146;, spurs an a&#146;;<br> This is the way the cadgers rides,<br> Creels an a&#146;, creels an a&#146;."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Another rhyme of the same kind is:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">Ride, dide, dide,<br> Ride t&#146; Aberdeen,<br> An buy fite bread,<br> She fan ere he cam back<br> The carlin wiz dead, <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A><br> Up wi&#146; her club,<br> Gie her on the lug,<br> An said, 'Rise up, carlin,<br> An eat fite bread."'</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Two children placed themselves back to back, locked their arms together, and alternately lifted each other, repeating the words:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">Weigh butter, weigh cheese,<br> Weigh a, pun a&#146; caunle grease."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Here follow various rhymes current among the young:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"A, B, buff,<br> The cattie lickit snuff,<br> An the monkey chawed tobacco."</p>  
<p>"A, B, buff,<br> Gee the cat a cuff,<br> Gee her ane, gee her twa,<br> Rap her hehd t&#146; the stehn wa&#146;."</p>

<p>"The little lady lairdie<br> She longt for a baby,<br> She took her father's grey hunn<br> An row&#146;d it in a plaidy.<br> Says 'Hishie, bishie, bow, wow,<br> Lang legit now ow<br> In&#146;t warna for yir muckle baird<br> I wad kiss yir mou-ow'."</p>

<p>"A bawbee bap,<br> A leather strap,<br> An a tow t&#146; hang the baker."</p>  
<p>"Four-an-twenty tailors<br> Chasin at a snail,<br> The snail shot oot its horns<br> Like a hummil coo.<br> 'Ah,' cried the foremost tailor,<br> 'We're a&#146; stickit noo.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"Wallace wicht<br> Upon a nicht<br> Took in a stack o&#146; bere,<br> An or the moon at fair daylicht<br> Hid draff o&#146;t till's more."</p>  
<p>"That's the lady's forks an knives,<br> An that's the lady's table,<br> An that's the lady's looking-glass,<br> An that's the baby's cradle."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>This rhyme was repeated on placing the fingers in such positions as to imitate knives, tables, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The following is a rhyme on the numbers up to twenty:--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"One, two,<br> Buckle my shoe;<br> Three, four,<br> Open the door;<br> Five, six,<br> Pick up sticks;<br> Seven, eight,<br> Lay them straight;<br> Nine, ten,<br> A good fat hen;<br> Eleven, twel&#146;,<br> Gar her swell;<br> Thirteen, fourteen,<br> Draw the curtain;<br> Fifteen, sixteen,<br> Maid in the kitchen;<br> Seventeen, eighteen,<br> I am waitin;<br> Nineteen, twenty,<br> My stomach's empty;<br> Please, mother, give me my dinner."</p>  
<p>"Steal a needle, steal a preen,<br> Steal a coo or a&#146; be deen."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>This sensible rhyme was often repeated to children when they were guilty of pilfering, or began to show any inclination to do so.</p>  
<p>The following is called the "Souter's Grace":--</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">"What are we before thee, O King Crispin? Naething bit a parcel o&#146; easy ozy sooter bodies, nae worth one old shoe to mend another. Yet thou hast given us leather to yark, and leather to bark, oot-seam awls, and in-seam awls, pincers and petrie-balls, lumps o&#146; creesch and balls o&#146; rosit, and batter in a cappie. Amen."</FONT></p>
