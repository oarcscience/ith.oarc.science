### ROSS.

The Ross-shire account of fairies is again much the same. The people say
very little about them, and those who have been kind enough to note
stories picked up amongst their less instructed neighbours, have only
sent fresh evidence to prove that the fairy creed is the same there as
everywhere, and that it is not quite extinct.

1\. I have a story, got through the kindness of Mr. Osgood Mackenzie, in
which a Lowland minister speaks slightingly of the fairies. "He was
riding home through a dark glen, and through an oak wood, where there
was many a green tolman (mound). He was surrounded by a squad of little
men, leaping before him and dancing behind him. They took him off the
horse and carried him up through the skies, his head under him now, and
his feet under again, the world running round; and at last they dropped
him near his own house.

2\. In another story, a lot of fairies borrow a weaver's loom at night,
without his leave, and make a web of green cloth from stolen wool.
