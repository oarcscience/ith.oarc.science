### XXV.

### THE ISLE OF PABAIDH.

From Alexander M'Donald, tenant, and others, Barra. July 1859.

THERE came a woman of peace (a fairy) the way of the house of a man in
the island of Pabaidh, and she had the hunger of motherhood on her. He
gave her food, and that went well with her. She staid that night. When
she went away, she said to him, "I am making a desire that none of the
people of this island may go in childbed after this." None of these
people, and none others that would make their dwelling in the island
ever departed in childbed from that time.

(Gaelic omitted)

...

Written by Hector MacLean, from the telling of a man in Barra.
