Chapter One

Preliminary

>  

> In the early days of exploration of prehistoric relics little care was
> bestowed on discriminating the several layers of deposit through which
> the spade cut, and what was found was thrown up into a common heap,
> and little account was taken as to the depths at which the several
> deposits lay.

> I had the chance in 1892 of visiting La Laugerie Basse on the Vézère
> in company with Dr Massénat and M. Philibert Lalande, who conducted
> the exploration after MM. Christy and Lartet had abandoned the field.
> They had to carry on the work with very limited means, but they
> arrived, nevertheless, at conclusions which had escaped the earlier
> explorers.

> Dr Massénat had driven a shaft down beside the bed of the peasant who
> lived under the rock, and who, when I saw him, was bedridden. His
> children, pretty brown-eyed boys and girls, bare-footed and
> bare-legged, were there, and I gave them some sous. As the dwelling
> was under the rock and the floor was earth, the refuse of the meals of
> the family went to raise the deposit along with particles of chalk
> falling from above. One of my sous, bearing the effigy of Napoleon
> III, fell, and in the scuffle that ensued disappeared under the soil.
> By the sick man's bed, as already stated, was a shaft driven down to
> the virgin soil, and this passed through a layer very modern, in which
> to this day my sou lies, then through fragments of Medieval crockery,
> next Merovingian relics, then Roman scraps of iron and coins, below
> that remains of the Bronze Age, below that again those of the Polished
> Stone Period. Then ensued a gap--a tract of sterile soil; and then all
> at once began a rich bed of deposits--this time distinct from the rest
> in that they pertained to a people who were contemporary with the
> mammoth, the cave--bear, and the reindeer in France. Finally in this
> lay the skeleton of a man whose thigh had been crushed by a fallen
> mass of stone from the rock that arched over it, and who had been
> clothed in skins ornamented with shells from the Atlantic coast.

> From this it may be seen how important it is to differentiate the
> strata at which lie the remains of ancient man.

> The same may be said with regard to folklore. A great amount had been
> collected into heaps, but no attempt had been made on a large scale to
> sift and sort out what had been found, and determine to what layer in
> our population they belong. The grouping is of the crudest. Birth,
> marriage, death lore go into their several piles, so do ghost and
> witch stories, and tales of dwarfs. What we really want to know is,
> Whence came the several items found?

> Here, in Great Britain, we form an amalgam of several distinct races,
> and each race has contributed something towards the common stock of
> folklore. In my own neighbourhood we have two distinct types of
> humanity: one with high cheekbones, dusky skin, dark hair, full of
> energy, unscrupulous as to the *meum* and *tuum*, moneymaking, by
> every conceivable means. The other is fair-haired, clear-skinned,
> slow, steady, honourable, with none of the alertness of the other. I
> can point out a family: the eldest girl, illegitimate, is wild,
> indisciplined, dark-haired and sallow-skinned. The mother, of the same
> type, married a fair-haired man, and the children are of mixed breed.

> Through intermarriage there is an importation of the superstitious
> beliefs of the lower type into the higher. This has been going on for
> a long time. A dominating race absorbs some of the convictions of the
> race it has subdued; and we generally find that the former regard the
> latter with some awe, as possessed of magical and mysterious powers
> beyond its own range of acquisitions.

> We cannot say that a certain bit of folklore is Celtic and not
> pre--Celtic because picked up where there is fusion of blood, any more
> than we can say that a piece of granite strewed upon alluvial soil or
> lying on limestone belongs to that on which it rests.

> Mr Tyler and Mr Fraser, the great students in Comparative Folklore,
> have devoted their attention to the development and expansion of
> certain primitive beliefs and practices, but Mr Gomme, in his
> epoch-making book, *Ethnology in Folklore* (London 1892), was the
> first to my knowledge who pointed out the necessity of classification
> according to the beds whence the items of folklore came.

> In this volume, which does not pretend to be more than a popular
> introduction to the study of the science, I have confined myself as
> much as possible to the beliefs of the peoples who occupied the
> British Isles, and have not gone like other writers to the usages of
> savages for explanation of customs and traditions, except very
> occasionally.

> In some instances we can trace scraps of folklore back to whence they
> came. In the legends of several of the Irish saints we have them
> represented as floating over the sea on leaves. The idea is so odd and
> so preposterous--as there are in Ireland no leaves of any size that
> could be serviceable--that we are constrained to look back and see
> whether this be not an adaptation of a much earlier myth. Now, in an
> old Flemish poem on Brandaein, or St Brendan the Voyager, he meets on
> the ocean with a Thumbling seated on a leaf, floating, in one hand a
> pan, in the other a style. This latter he dipped into the sea, and
> from it let drops trickle into the pan. When the vessel was full he
> emptied it and renewed the process, and this he is condemned to
> continue doing till he has drained the ocean dry. Whence came this
> fantastic conception? It was brought from the original seats of the
> Aryan people in the East, for there Brahma is represented as floating
> over the deep on a lotus. And after the death of Brahma, when water
> overflowed the whole earth, then Vischnu sat, as a small child, on a
> fig-leaf, and floated on the wild sea, sucking the toe of his right
> foot.

> In a wild and upland district in East Cornwall is the ancient mansion
> of the Trevelyans. It comprises a quadrangle with granite mullioned
> windows, and is entered through a handsome gate--house. At the time of
> the Commonwealth, here lived a Squire Peter Trevelyan; he was born in
> 1613 and died in 1705--there is nothing like being precise. He was a
> staunch Royalist, and a band of Roundhead soldiers was sent to arrest
> him. They came to the gate-house and rapped. Squire Trevelyan put his
> head out of the window above--they show you the very window to this
> day--and bade the crop-eared rascals be off, or he would send his
> lance-men after them and forcibly dislodge them. As they did not stir,
> he took a couple of beehives he had in the chamber over the gate and
> flung them among the troopers. The bees swarmed out, fell on and
> speedily dispersed them.

> Andernach, on the Rhine, was engaged in incessant feud with the town
> of Linz; and one night it was attacked by the citizens of the rival
> town. The watchmen were asleep, so also the townsfolk; but two bakers'
> apprentices were engaged at the oven, when, hearing a sound outside
> the walls, they mounted to the parapets and saw the enemy engaged in
> planting ladders. Instantly they caught up some beehives that were on
> the walls and flung them among the assailants. The bees rushed out,
> and proved such terrible lanzknects that the Linzers were routed and
> sent flying helter-skelter home. Can the story be doubted? The
> citizens of Andernach point to the figures of the two youths carved in
> stone at one of the portals, and tell you that this was done in
> acknowledgment of their achievement.

> At Ballyrawney in Ireland a story is told to this effect. About eight
> centuries ago a powerful chief, on the point of waging war against the
> head of another clan, seeing the inferiority of his troops, begged St
> Gobnat to assist him, and this was in a field near where the battle
> was about to be fought. In this field was a beehive, and the saint
> granted the request by turning the bees into spearmen, who issued from
> the hive with all the ardour of warriors, fell on the enemy, and put
> him to rout. After the battle the conquering chief revisited the spot
> whence he had received such miraculous aid, when he found that the
> straw hive had been metamorphosed into an article shaped like a helmet
> and composed of brass. This relic remains to this day in testimony to
> the truth of the story, and is in the possession of the O'Hierlyhie
> family, and is held by the Irish peasantry in such profound veneration
> that they will travel several miles to procure a drop of water from
> it, which, if given to a dying relative or friend, they imagine will
> secure their sure admission into heaven. Crofton Croker, who tells
> this story, adds that not long ago some water from this brazen beehive
> was administered to a dying priest by his coadjutor, in compliance
> with the popular superstition. These stories were not wafted from one
> place to another, but derived from a common origin when the bees were
> regarded as friends and protectors of a house or a town. They went by
> the name of "the birds of God" or "Mary's birds" in Germany, and were
> supposed to be in communication with the Spirit. When a master died in
> a house, his heir went before the hive and announced the death to the
> bees and entreated them to remain and protect him. In like manner,
> when a young couple became engaged they informed the bees and
> requested their favour. To some extent they would seem to have been
> regarded as the household spirits guarding a family, and they were
> always treated with reverence. A hive might never be sold, only given.

> Now that we have sugar supplied so freely, we can hardly realise to
> what an extent honey was formerly required, not only for sweetening
> cakes, but also for the brewing of metheglin, or mead. It was the
> drink of the gods; and if a child was to be cast out to die, if a
> compassionate neighbour touched its lips with honey the heathen father
> dare not allow it to perish. This occurs in the life of St Liudger,
> whose mother Liafburg was saved by this means when the father had
> ordered her to be drowned.

> There be certain superstitions not easy to be explained. Actors and
> actresses have a strong prejudice against performing in green dresses.
> I have heard a cultured man in Yorkshire explain, quite seriously,
> that the disturbed condition in England of late, the strikes, the
> labour unrest, and suffragist outrages, were due to the introduction
> of the green halfpenny stamp; and green throughout England and
> Scotland is regarded as an unlucky colour. Mr Henderson, in his
> Northern Folklore, says: "Green, ever an ominous colour in the
> Lowlands of Scotland, must on no account be worn at a wedding. The
> fairies, whose chosen colour it is, would resent the insult and
> destroy the wearer. Whether on this account or on any other I know
> not, but the notion of ill-luck in connection with it is widespread. I
> have heard of mothers in the South of England who absolutely forbade
> their daughters to wear anything of this colour, and who avoided it
> even in the furniture of their homes." The real reason is that green
> being the colour of the elves and pixies, if worn gives these imps a
> power over those who have assumed their colour; and renders the bride
> in "gown of green" liable to be carried off to one of their
> underground abodes.

> There is a very curious story told by William of Newburgh, who was
> born in the reign of King Stephen and wrote his Chronicle down to
> 1198; it is also found in Raduif of Coggeshall, who wrote his English
> History in 1223.

> In Suffolk, at Woolpit (wolf-pits originally), near Stowmarket, a boy
> and his sister were found by the inhabitants of that place near the
> mouth of a pit. They were formed like other children, but the whole of
> their skin was of a green colour. No one could understand their
> speech. When they were brought as curiosities to the house of Sir
> Richard de Calne, at Wikes, they wept bitterly. Bread and other
> victuals were set before them, but they would not touch them. At
> length, when some beans just cut, with their stalks, were brought into
> the house, they made signs with great avidity that they should be
> given to them. When they were brought, they opened the stalks instead
> of the pods, thinking the beans were in the hollow of them; but not
> finding them, they wept anew. When those who were present saw this,
> they opened the pods and showed them the naked beans. They fed on
> these with great delight, and for a long time tasted no other food.
> The boy, however, was always languid and depressed, and he died within
> a short while. The girl enjoyed constant good health; and becoming
> accustomed to various kinds of food, lost completely that green colour
> and gradually recovered the sanguine habit of her whole body. She was
> afterwards baptized and lived for many years in the service of the
> knight, but was rather loose and wanton in her conduct. William of
> Newburgh says that he long hesitated to believe the story, but was at
> length overcome by the weight of evidence. At length the girl married
> a man at Lenna (Lynn?) and lived many years. She told that she and her
> brother came from an underground land where there was no sun, but
> enjoyed a degree of light like twilight in summer. Whatever credence
> may be put in her story, it seems that there is some truth in the
> tale, and that these two children belonged to the Elfin or Dwarf stock
> that still lingered in the land. The green hue is probably an
> addition, so as to make them of Fairy stock. One can see now that
> there was a reason for the prejudice against green as being th colour
> of the strange people so far below the Aryan occupants of the land in
> intellect and culture.

> That some of the myths of dwarfs "are connected with tradition of real
> indigenous or hostile tribes is settled beyond question by th evidence
> brought forward by Grimm, Nilsson and Hanusch. With a; the difficulty
> of analysing the mixed nature of the dwarfs c European folklore, and
> judging how far they are elves, or gnome\~ or suchlike nature spirits,
> and how far human beings in a mystic aspect, it is impossible not to
> recognise this latter element in th kindly or mischievous aborigines
> of the land, with their specie language, and religion, and costume."
> \[a\]

> As a farmer marks his sheep, and his horse turned out on th moors by a
> hole punched in the ear, or a snip, so persons ar marked out as
> pertaining to the gods. Circumcision tharks a pertaining to Jehovah or
> to Allah. The tonsure marks the priest c monk as belonging to God; and
> the green colour worn is a sign that the person or thing so indicated
> is given over to the Elves.

> In trying to allot the various superstitions dealt with in these
> pages, it must be borne in mind that we have to do with a pre-Aryan
> people, as well as Aryan people who had long passed out on the
> earliest and the rudest forms of myth-making and ceremonial and
> animistic beliefs. They brought their convictions with them to our
> island, but in a modified form; and the modifications were due either
> to advance in culture or to contact with other peoples whose opinions
> were different from their own. Moreover, each stock, pre-Aryan and
> Aryan, brought with it some elements that pertained to a condition of
> mind and belief that had been common to both, but out of which both
> had grown.

> The field of folklore is so extensive and so interesting, that it
> cannot be ploughed up by one hand and its riches revealed. All that I
> have attempted to do is to take a few salient points in it and show to
> what conclusions they lead, and as far as might be I have drawn on my
> own experience in collecting the folklore of the West of England.
