Chapter Three

The Body of Man

 

> A friend, a judge in Ceylon, had to sentence a Cingalese to be hung
> for murder. The man, when sentence had been pronounced, glared at him
> and said: "It is well, and shortly after I shall be a dog and will
> bite and tear you." The doctrine of the Hindu as to the spirit of man
> is that it passes at death into some other body, presumedly that of an
> animal. And that this was the belief of other Aryan peoples can hardly
> be doubted. The soul is immortal, imperishable, and it must have a
> body into which to enter. Till it finds such it hovers about uneasily.

> Pythagoras and his followers taught that after death men's souls
> passed into other bodies, of this or that kind, according to the
> manner of life they had led. If they had been vicious, they were
> imprisoned in the bodies of vile brutes, there to do penance for
> several ages, at the expiration of which they returned again to
> animate men; but if they lived virtuously, some animal of a nobler
> kind, or even a human creature, was to be their lot.

> What led Pythagoras to this opinion was the persuasion he had that the
> soul was of an imperishable nature; whence he concluded that it must
> remove into some other body upon its abandoning this. That he derived
> his doctrine from the Brahrnins cannot be doubted. It was a revolt
> against this belief in an eternal revolution of existence that led
> Buddha to start his scheme of escape from it by making an opening for
> the soul to free itself, by the destruction of passion, even of all
> desire, so that the soul might reach Nirvana, and be absorbed into the
> Godhead whence it had emanated.

> A few instances will suffice to show that the transmigration of souls
> into animals was held in Europe as well as in India.

> In Luxembourg lived a gentleman who had a daughter, his only child. An
> officer of the garrison loved her, but as the father disapproved of
> the match he sent the girl into a convent, the windows of which were
> on the town wall. The officer soon discovered where she was and
> succeeded in opening communication with her, and it was arranged
> between them that she was to let herself down from her window on the
> ensuing night at midnight. The officer arranged with the soldier who
> was to act sentinel that hour to lend his assistance. However, such a
> hurricane of rain came on that the commandant sent word round that the
> sentinels were to be changed every hour in place of every two hours.
> Thus it came to pass that a soldier was keeping guard under the wall
> who had not been initiated into the secret. At midnight, seeing
> something white descending, he shouted, "Who goes there?" and
> receiving no answer, fired and shot the girl. Since then every night a
> white rabbit is seen running along that portion of the fortification.
> It is the reincarnation of the girl.

> At the beginning of the thirteenth century there lived a knight in the
> castle of Bierloz whose beautiful daughter was to be married to a
> young nobleman in the service of Duke Valeran of Luxembourg. The duke
> decided that the wedding should take place at Logne, where was his
> court. But when the damsel arrived there he himself fell in love with
> her, and on some excuse sent the young bridegroom-elect away, also the
> father, and his own duchess, and took the girl as his mistress,
> winning her heart by presents of jewellery and splendid clothes. The
> father died of grief, and the youth soon after fell. One night the
> girl had vanished and was sought for in vain. A day or two later a
> servant told his master that her corpse had been found at the entrance
> of a subterranean passage. The duke hurried to the spot. The body had
> vanished, but in its place appeared a goat charged with glittering
> trinkets, that eluded all attempts to catch it. This mysterious goat
> is still visible. Any one who can catch it by the tail and hold on
> will be drawn to where are collected the precious articles received by
> the damsel.

> In a good many places it is believed that witches are transformed
> after death into hares; and a lady wrote to me from the Isle of Man
> that she could not get her servants to eat hare, because it might be
> the body of some old woman transformed.

> It is not, however, only into quadrupeds that human souls pass. When I
> was a small boy an old woman in the place, who could neither read nor
> write, told me a folk-tale that is very similar to one Grimm collected
> in Germany. A mother died, and the father married again. He had by his
> first wife a daughter; by the second a son. The brother loved his
> half-sister dearly, but the wicked stepmother hated her. "Child," said
> the stepmother one day, "go to the grocer's shop and buy me a pound of
> candles." She gave her the money, and the little girl went, bought the
> candles, and started on her return. There was a stile to cross. She
> put down the candles whilst she got over the stile; up came a dog and
> ran away with them. She went back to the grocer's and got a second
> bunch. She came to the stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to
> climb over; up came the dog and ran off with the candles. She went
> again to the grocer's and procured a third bunch, and just the same
> happened. Then she came to her stepmother crying, for she had spent
> all the money and had lost three bunches of candles.

> The stepmother said, "Come, lay thy head on my lap that I may comb thy
> hair." So the little one laid her head in the woman's lap, who
> proceeded to comb the yellow silken hair. And when she combed, the
> hair fell over her knees down to the ground. Then the stepmother hated
> her more for the beauty of her hair, so she said to her, "I cannot
> part thy hair on my knee, fetch me a billet of wood." So she fetched
> it. Then said the stepmother, "I cannot part thy hair with a comb,
> fetch me an axe." So she fetched it.

> "Now," said the wicked woman, "lay thy head on the billet whilst I
> part thy hair." Well, she laid down her little golden head without
> fear, and, whist! down came the axe and it was off. Then the woman
> took the heart and liver of the little girl and she stewed them and
> brought them into the house for supper. The husband tasted them and
> said that they had a strange flavour. She gave some to the little boy,
> but he would not eat. She tried to force him, but he refused, and ran
> out into the garden and took up his little sister, put her in a box,
> and buried the box under a rose tree; and every day he went to the
> tree and wept.

> One day the rose tree flowered. It was spring, and there among the
> flowers was a white bird, and it sang sweetly. It flew to a cobbler's
> shop and perched on a tree hard by, and thus it sang:--

> My wicked mother slew me,  
> My dear father ate me;  
> My little brother whom I love  
> Sits below, and I sing above.

> "Sing again that beautiful song," asked the shoemaker. "If you will
> give me first the little red shoes you are making." The cobbler gave
> the shoes, the bird sang the song, and then flew to a tree in front of
> a watchmaker's, and sang the same strain.

> "Oh, the beautiful song! Sing it again, sweet bird!" asked the
> watchmaker. "If you will give me that gold watch and chain in your
> hand." So the jeweller gave the watch and chain. The bird sang the
> song, and flew away with the shoes in one foot and the chain in the
> other, to where three millers were picking a millstone. The bird
> perched on a tree and sang the song, and as a reward for re-singing it
> had the millstone put round its neck as a collar. After that the bird
> flew to the house of the stepmother, and rattled the millstone against
> the eaves. Said the stepmother, "It thunders." Then the little boy ran
> out to hear the thunder, and down dropped the red shoes at his feet.
> Next out ran the father, and down fell the chain about his neck.
> Lastly, out ran the stepmother, and down fell the millstone on her
> head and she died.

> This story must be older than the dispersion of the Aryan race,
> though, of course, it has undergone modifications. It is found among
> Greek folktales, also in Scotland as "the milk-white dove," also in
> Hungary, and in Southern France.

> In *Faust* mad Gretchen in prison sings a snatch of this as a ballad.

> I have given the tale at length, because it illustrates so fully what
> is the point now being insisted on. The bird is the transmigrated
> little girl. But that is not all. The dog that carries away the
> bunches of candles is the cruel stepmother who, in life, has
> transformed herself in this manner.

> For as human souls after death go into the bodies of birds or beasts,
> so can they during life shift their quarters. This is the origin of
> the numerous tales of werewolves, and witches becoming cats or hares.

> Among the Norsemen it was believed that witches could take even the
> shapes of seals--the only portion of them that they could not change
> was the eyes, and by them they might be recognised.

> The word employed among the Norsemen for such as could change their
> shape was *eigi einhamr*, that is, "not of our skin". There were
> various ways in which they could change their shape. The original was
> that described in the Ynglinga Saga of Odin. "He could change his
> appearance. There his body lay as sleeping or dead. But he became a
> bird or a beast, a fish or a serpent, and at a moment's notice could
> go into distant lands on his own business or on that of others."

> King Harold of Denmark required some information about the procedure
> in Iceland, and he induced a warlock to assume the shape of a whale
> and go thither. In the great battle in which Hrolf Krake fell in
> Denmark, one Bodvar Bjarki assumed the form and force of a bear, and
> fought furiously, whilst in the tent of the king his body lay as
> though dead. It was only when taunted because he appeared inactive
> that he rushed out into the midst of the fight in his human form, and
> fell.

> A secondary stage was that in which one who was *eigi einhamr* threw
> over him a skin of a wolf or bear and then became that beast. The
> swan-maidens had their swan dresses that they laid aside to bathe.
> Velund stole one and thenceforth she was a woman. In like manner we
> have in Ireland and Cornwall stories of mermaids who laid aside their
> fishlike appendages--and these were seized by some onlooking peeping
> Tom, and he secured the damsel and made her his wife.

> In the Volsunga Saga is a story of how King Volsung, who had married
> his daughter Signy to King Siggeir of Gothland, went on invitation to
> his son-in-law, along with his ten sons, and was treacherously waylaid
> and killed, with all his retinue except his sons. These were set in
> the stocks in a wood and left there to perish. The first night a huge
> grey she-wolf came, attacked, tore and devoured one of the youths.
> Next night she came again and killed a second, and so on till only one
> was left, Sigmund. His sister Signy sent a trusty servant with a pot
> of honey, and instructions to smear with it the face of her one
> surviving brother, and to put some into his mouth. At night the
> she-wolf came, and snuffling the honey licked Sigmund's face and
> thrust her tongue into his mouth. Thereupon he clenched his teeth on
> her tongue and a desperate struggle ensued. The brute drove its feet
> against the stocks and broke them, but Sigmund tore out her tongue by
> the roots. And that wolf was the mother of King Siggeir, who had
> assumed the vulpine form by her magic arts, and now perished
> miserably.

> Many years ago, in fact in 1865, I published a *Book of Werewolves*
> that has long been out of print. In it I collected all the stories I
> could find of transformation into wolves, and I have come across
> others since. In fact it is apparently a universal belief that certain
> persons have the faculty of assuming a bestial form at pleasure.

> Herodotus says: "It seems that the Neuri are sorcerers, if one may
> believe the Scythians and the Greeks established in Scythia; for each
> Neurian changes himself, once in the year, into the form of a wolf,
> and he continues in that form for several days, after which he resumes
> his former state."

> Ovid tells the story, in his *Metamorphoses*, of Lycaon, King of
> Arcadia, who, entertaining Jupiter one day, set before him a hash of
> human flesh to prove his omniscience, whereupon the god transformed
> him into a wolf.

> Pliny related that on the festival of Jupiter, Lycaeus, one of the
> family of Antaeus, was selected by lot, and conducted to the brink of
> the Arcadian lake. He then hung his clothes on a tree and plunged into
> the water, whereupon he was transformed into a wolf. Nine years after,
> if he had not tasted human flesh, he was at liberty to swim back and
> resume his former shape, which had in the meantime become aged, as
> though he had worn it for nine years.

> The following story is from Petronius:--

> My master had gone to Capua to sell some old clothes. I seized the
> opportunity, and persuaded our guest to bear me company about five
> miles out of town; for he was a soldier, and as bold as death. We set
> out about cock-crow, and the moon shone bright as day, when coming
> among some monuments, my man began to converse with the stars, whilst
> I jogged along singing and counting them. Presently I looked back
> after him, and saw him strip and lay his clothes by the side of the
> road. My heart was in my mouth in an instant; I stood like a corpse;
> when, in a crack, he was turned into a wolf. Don't think I'm joking: I
> would not tell you a lie for the finest fortune in the world.

> But to continue: After he was turned into a wolf, he set up a howl and
> made straight for the woods. At first I did not know whether I was on
> my head or my heels; but at last going to take up his clothes, I found
> them turned into stone. The sweat streamed from me, and I never
> expected to get over it. Melissa began to wonder why I walked so late.
> "Had you come a little sooner," she said, "you might at least have
> lent us a hand, for a wolf broke into the farm and has butchered all
> our cattle; but though he got off, it was no laughing matter for him,
> for a servant of ours ran him through with a pike." Hearing this, I
> could not close an eye; but as soon as it was daylight I ran home like
> a pedlar that has been eased of his pack. Coming to the place where
> the clothes had been turned into stone, I saw nothing but a pool of
> blood; and when I got home, I found my soldier lying in bed, like an
> ox in a stall, and a surgeon dressing his neck. I saw at once that he
> was a fellow who could change his skin, and never after could I eat
> bread with him--no, not if you would have killed me.

> Bodin tells some transformation stories, and professes that he had
> them on good authority. He says that the Royal Procurator--General
> Bourdin had assured him that he had shot a wolf, and that the arrow
> had stuck in the beast's thigh. A few hours after, the arrow was
> extracted from the thigh of a man lying wounded in bed. At Vernon,
> about the year 1566, the witches and warlocks gathered in great
> multitudes under the shape of cats. Four or five men were attacked in
> a lone place by a number of these beasts. The men stood their ground
> with pertinacity, succeeded in slaying one puss, and in wounding many
> others. Next day a number of wounded women were found in the town, and
> they gave the judge an accurate account of all the circumstances
> connected with their wounding.

> Nynauld, who wrote a book on Lycanthropy in 1618, relates how that in
> a village in Switzerland, near Lucerne, a peasant was attacked by a
> wolf whilst he was hewing timber; he defended himself, and smote off a
> foreleg of the beast. The moment that the blood began to flow the
> wolf's form changed, and he recognised a woman without her arm. She
> was burnt alive. Any number of stories might be instanced to show how
> widely spread this superstition is, but these must suffice. In the
> British Isles, whence wolves have long ago been expelled, it is only
> hares and cats that represent transformed witches.

> There is, however, the old English romance of *William and the
> Werewolf*, but this professes to be a translation from the French.
> Gervase of Tilbury, however, says in his *Otia Imperalia*: "We have
> often seen in England, at changes of the moon, men transformed into
> wolves, which sort of human beings the French call *gerulfos*, but the
> English call them *wer--wlf*; *wer* in English signifies man, and
> *wif* a wolf."

> In Devonshire transformed witches range the moors in the shape of
> black dogs, and I know a story of two such creatures appearing in an
> inn and nightly drinking the cider, till the publican shot a silver
> button over their heads, when they were instantly transformed into two
> ill-favoured old hags.

> We now come to another form of transformation--a change of sex. I had
> an old carpenter many years ago who had been with my father before me,
> and he once told me that he knew a man in Cornwall who had married,
> and became a father of a family; then he changed his sex, married, and
> bore a second family. Ovid tells the story of Iphis, a daughter of
> Ligdus and Telethusa of Crete. When Telethusa was pregnant her husband
> bade her destroy the child when born if it proved to be a girl,
> because his poverty was so great that he could not afford to rear a
> daughter. Telethusa was distressed, and the goddess Isis appeared to
> her in a dream and bade her preserve the child. Telethusa brought
> forth a daughter, which was given to a nurse and passed for a boy
> under the name of Iphis. Ligdus continued ignorant of the deceit, and
> when Iphis was full grown her father resolved to give her in marriage
> to lanthe, the beautiful daughter of Telestes. A day to celebrate the
> nuptials was fixed, and mother and daughter were in consternation; but
> prayed to Isis, by whose advice the life of Iphis had been preserved.
> The goddess waas favourable, and changed the sex of Iphis, and, on the
> morrow, the nuptials were consummated with the greatest rejoicings.

> A better-known story is that of Tiresias, the Theban prophet, who as a
> boy was suddenly changed into a girl. Seven years after he again
> changed his sex, to his great satisfaction. Whilst he was a woman he
> had been married, and he was married again after he became a man.

> Among the Icelanders it was believed that certain men became women
> every seventh day. That which caused the burning of the worthy Njall,
> his wife, and sons, in their house was the taunt of a certain
> Skarpedin, who threw a pair of breeches at one Flossi and bade him
> wear them, as he changed sex every ninth day. In the Gullathing laws
> is one condemning to outlawry any man who charged another with change
> of sex, or with having given birth to a child. When Thorvald the
> Wide--Travelled went round Iceland with a German missionary bishop
> named Frederick, preaching the Gospel, the smooth face and long
> petticoats of the prelate gave rise to bitter jests. A local poet sang
> a strain purporting that the bishop had become the mother of nine
> children of whom Thorvald was the father; and the Icelander was so
> furious that he hewed down the scald with his battleaxe.

> We have seen now how that from the idea or belief in metempsychosis
> possessed by the whole Aryan race, we have a series of superstitions
> relative to change after death into another animal form, and also
> changes, mainly voluntary and temporary, during life.

> But there is still another class to which reference must now be made,
> and that is where the transformation is involuntary, the consequence
> of a spell being cast on an individual requiring him or her to become
> a beast or a monster with no escape except under conditions difficult
> of execution or of obtaining. To this category belong a number of
> so-called fairy tales, that actually are folk-tales. And these do not
> all pertain to Aryan peoples, for wherever magical arts are believed
> to be all-powerful, there one of its greatest achievements is the
> casting of a spell so as to alter completely the appearance of the
> person on whom it is cast, so that this individual becomes an animal.
> One need only recall the story in the Arabian Nights of the Calenders
> and the three noble ladies of Bagdad, in which the wicked Sisters are
> transformed into bitches that have to be thrashed every day.

> But take such a tale as the *Frog Prince*. This is one of the most
> ancient and widely spread of folk--tales. It is found in the Sanskrit
> *Pantschatandra* (Benfey 1\#92), in Campbell's *Tales of the Western
> Highlands* (No. xxxii), in Grimm's *Kindermürchen*, No I; in Chamber's
> *Popular Rhymes of Scotland* p.52 in Halliwell's *English Popular
> Rhymes* and *Fireside Stories*, p. 43; and in numerous other
> collections. J. Leyden in his *Complaynt of Scotland* gives it. He
> says, "According to the popular tale a lady is sent by her stepmother
> to draw water from the well of the world's end. She arrives at the
> well after encountering many dangers, but soon perceives that her
> adventures have not reached a conclusion. A frog emerges from the
> well, and, before it suffers her to draw water, obliges her to betroth
> herself to the monster, under the penalty of being torn to pieces. The
> lady returns safe; but at midnight the frog lover appears at the door
> and demands entrance according to promise, to the great consternation
> of the lady and her nurse.

> Open the door, my hinny, my heart;  
> Open the door, mine ain wee thing  
> And mind the wods that you and I spak  
> Down in the meadow at the well-spring

> The frog is admitted and addresses her:--

> Take me up on your knee, my dearie,  
> Take me up on your knee, my dearie,  
> And mind the wods that you and I spak  
> At the cauld well sae weary

> The frog is finally disenchanted and appears as a prince in his
> original form."

> Here the story is told in its dryest and least poetical form. The
> prince had been bewitched into the form of a frog and could not
> recover his original shape till a girl had promised to be his wife,
> taken him into her chamber, and finally, in the English version of the
> tale, had cut off his head.

> So in the Countess D'Aulnoy's story of *The White Cat*, the damsel has
> to cut off the cat's head before it can be transformed into a prince.
> In *Beauty and the Beast* we have much the same theme.

> Professor Max Muller tried to establish that the story of the Frog
> Prince rose out of a misconception of the name of the sun in Sanskrit.
> But it has too many analogies for us to explain it thus. In the *Story
> of Seven Ravens* the seven brothers of a damsel are bewitched into
> these forms till they obtain release through their sister. In an old
> Danish ballad a youth is transformed into a raven by a cruel
> stepmother, till his sister releases him by giving her child, that he
> may pick out its eyes and drink its heart's blood before he can
> recover human form.

> I was shown a cavern in the Vorarlberg where I was told that a hideous
> monster like a gigantic toad had lived. It was a nobleman's son
> bewitched, and he could only be released by a girl kissing him on the
> lips. Several went to the cave, but were so repelled by his
> unsightliness that they fled. One, however, did remain and kiss him,
> whereupon he recovered his human form and married her.

> In the saga of Hrolf Kraki is an account of King Hring of the Uplands
> in Norway, who had a son named Bjorn by his wife. The queen died, and
> Hring took a beautiful Finn girl as his second wife. The king was
> often away on piratical expeditions, and whilst he was absent Bjorn
> and his stepmother had constant quarrels. Björn had been brought up
> with a well-to-do farmer's daughter named Bera, and they loved one
> another dearly. One day, after a sharp contest, the queen struck Björn
> on the face with a wolf-skin glove and said that he should become a
> rabid bear, and devour his father's flocks.

> After that Björn disappeared, and none knew what had become of him;
> and men sought but found him not. We must relate how that the king's
> sheep were slaughtered, half a score at a time, and it was all the
> work of a grey bear, both huge and grizzly.

> One evening it chanced that the Caries daughter saw this savage bear
> coming towards her, looking tenderly at her, and she recognised the
> eyes of Björn, the king's son, so she made but a slight attempt to
> escape; then the beast retreated, but she followed it, till she came
> to a cave. Now when she entered the cave there stood before her a man,
> who greeted Bera, the Cane's daughter, and she recognised him, for he
> was Björn, Hring's son. Overjoyed were they to meet. So they were
> together in the cave awhile, for she would not part from him when she
> had the chance of being with him; but he said that this was not proper
> that she should be there with him, for by day he was a beast and by
> night a man. Hring returned from his harrying, and was told how this
> Björn, his son, had vanished, and also how that a monstrous beast was
> up the country, and was destroying his flocks. The queen urged the
> king to have the bear slain.

> One night as Bera and Björn were together, he said to her:

> "Methinks tomorrow will be the day of my death, for they will hunt me
> down. But for myself I care not; it is little pleasure to live with
> this spell upon me, and my only comfort is that we are together; and
> now our union must be broken." He spoke to her of many other things,
> till the bear's form stole over him, and he went forth a bear. She
> followed him, and saw a great body of hunters come ovei the mountain
> ridges, and had a number of dogs with them. The bear rushed away from
> the cavern, but the dogs and the king's men came upon him, and there
> ensued a desperate struggle. They made a ring round him--he ranged
> about in it, but saw no means of escape. So he turned to where the
> king stood, and seized a man who stood next him, and rent him asunder.
> Then was the bear so exhausted that he cast himself down flat, and at
> once the men rushed in upon him and slew him.

> The king now went home, and Bera was in his company. The queen now
> made a great feast, and had the bear's flesh roasted for the banquet.
> The queen came to Bera with a dish, quite unexpectedly, and on it was
> bear's flesh, and she bade Bera eat it. She would not do so. "Here is
> a marvel," said the queen; "you reject the offer which a queen herself
> deigns to make to you." So she bit before her, and the queen looked
> into her mouth; she saw that one little grain of the bite had gone
> down, but Bera spat out all the rest from her mouth, and said she
> would take no more though she were tortured and killed.

> There are two points in this story deserving of notice. The one is
> recognition through the eyes, because it is through the eyes that the
> immortal soul looks out. The other is the effort made by the queen to
> get Bera to eat of the flesh, precisely as in the story of the *Rose
> Tree* the wicked stepmother endeavours to force the boy to eat the
> flesh of his sister.

> In the story of Lycaon also lycanthropy was associated with
> cannibalism; and these tales seem to point back to a period when there
> was a revolt against such practice. Probably among the prehistoric
> natives conquered by the Aryans, cannibalism had been in vogue. St.
> Jerome, speaking of the Attacotti in Britain, says that they were
> cannibals, and when a youth he had seen them. At a low stage of
> development of civilisation, cannibalism was a recognised means
> whereby men acquired vigour, for by eating at least the heart or brain
> of a valiant enemy they thought that they assimilated to themselves
> his rare and valuable qualities. At a far later period Hrolf Kraki,
> finding a poor frightened boy who was bullied and beaten by the
> warriors in the king's hail, gave him to drink the blood of a brave
> warrior he had killed, and thenceforth this timorous youth became a
> mighty champion. In the story of Kulhweh in the old Welsh *Mabinogion*
> there is an account of how Gwyn "killed Nwython, took out his heart,
> and forced Kyledr to eat his father's heart; thereupon Kyledr became
> wild and left the abodes of men."

> Even among the medieval moss-troopers of the Scottish and Northumbrian
> border, there are instances both in history and tradition of their
> having eaten the flesh and drunk the blood of their enemies, and a
> certain Lord Soulis was boiled alive, and the murderers afterwards
> drank the broth made out of him.

> It is therefore not by any means improbable that the stories of
> forcing human flesh on those reluctant to eat it may carry us back to
> an early period when cannibalism was not done away with, but when the
> conscience had begun to revolt against the practice.

> And who were these people who were cannibals? In the story of Bjorn
> and Bera the wicked stepmother was a Finn, and consequently not an
> Aryan. We are not told that the corresponding ill-disposed woman in
> the story of the *Rose Tree* was of a strange race, but we are
> informed that the yellow hair of the little girl especially roused her
> dislike. And if she belonged to the dark--haired people who occupied
> the land before the Celts arrived, this is explicable.

> That same people appear in household tales as giants. Not that they
> were actually such, but they acquired the reputation of being of
> extraordinary size because of the megalithic monuments they set
> up--giant's quoits, giant's needles, giant's tables and the like. In
> the nursery tales they are credited with drinking blood and grinding
> men's bones to make their bread. The descendants of this race are
> still with us, and are not always on a level of intelligence with the
> fair-haired Englishmen who live hard by. That this primitive people
> believed in the transmigration of souls is not probable. Everything
> points to that doctrine having been the special property of the
> Aryans.

> The Attacotti that Jerome saw, and who are mentioned by other writers
> as peculiarly ferocious men, were probably the lingering remains of
> the pre-Aryan inhabitants of the land; and the nursery tales about
> their devouring little children, and grinding men's bones to make
