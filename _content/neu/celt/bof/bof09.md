Chapter Nine

Pixies and Brownies

 

> In the year 1838, when I was a small boy of four years old, we were
> driving to Montpellier, on a hot summer day, over the long straight
> road that traverses a pebble and rubble strewn plain on which grows
> nothing save a few aromatic herbs.

> I was sitting on the box with my father, when to my great surprise I
> saw legions of dwarfs of about two eet high running along beside the
> horses--some sat laughing on the pole, some were scrambling up the
> harness to get on the backs of the horses. I remarked to my father
> what I saw, when he abruptly stopped the carriage and put me inside
> beside my mother, where, the conveyance being closed, I was out of the
> sun. The effect was that little by little the host of imps diminished
> in number till they disappeared altogether. When my wife was a girl of
> fifteen, she was walking down a lane in Yorkshire between green
> hedges, when she saw, seated in one of the privet hedges a little
> green man, perfectly well made, who looked at her with his beady black
> eyes. He was about a foot or eighteen inches high. She was so
> frightened that she ran home. She cannot recall exactly in what month
> this took place, but knows that it was a summer day.

> One day a son of mine, a lad of about twelve, was sent into the garden
> to pick peapods for the cook to shell for dinner. Presently he rushed
> into the house as white as chalk, to say that whilst he was engaged
> upon the task imposed upon him he saw standing between the rows of
> peas a little man wearing a red cap, a green jacket, and brown
> knee-reeches, whose face was old and wan, and who had\~ a grey beard
> and eyes as black and hard as Sloes. He stared so intently at the boy
> that the latter took to his heels. I know exactly when this occurred,
> as I entered it in my diary, and I know when I saw the imps by looking
> into my father' diary, and though he did not enter the circumstance, I
> recall the vision today as distinctly as, when I was a child.

> Now, in all three cases, these apparitions were due to the effect of a
> hot sun on the head. But such an explanation is not sufficient. Why
> did all three see small beings of a very similar character With
> pressure on the brain and temporary hallucination the pictures
> presented to the eye are never originally conceived, they are
> reproductions of representations either seen previously or conceived
> from descriptions given by others.

> In my case and that of my wife, we saw imps, because our nurses had
> told us of them and their freaks. In the case of my son, he had read
> Grimm's Tales and seen the illustrations to them.

> Both St Hildegarde and St Bridget of Sweden had visions that were
> supposed to fill gaps in the Gospel narrative or amplify the stories
> there told. It is noticeable that in these revelations there is not a
> waft of Orientalism, they are vulgarly Occidental. Every one may be
> explained by the paintings, carvings, and miniatures with which these
> ladies had been familiar from childhood. If we had not these monuments
> of mediaeval art remaining, we could construct Catholic iconography
> from the revelations of these ecstatics.

> We may now go a step farther back. Where did our nurses, whence did
> Grimm obtain their tales of kobolds, gnomes, dwarfs, pixies, brownies,
> etc? They derived them from traditions of the past, handed down from
> generation to generation.

> But to go to the root of the matter. In what did the prevailing belief
> in the existence of these small people originate I do not myself hold
> that a widely extended belief, curiously coinciding, whether found in
> Scandinavia, in Germany, in England, Scotland, and Ireland, can have
> sprung out of nothing. Everything comes out of an egg or a seed. And I
> suspect that there did exist a small people, not so small as these
> imps are represented, but comparatively small beside the Aryans who
> lived in all those countries in which the tradition of their existence
> lingers on. They were not, I take it, the Dolmen builders--these are
> supposed to have been giants because of the gigantic character of
> their structures. They were a people who did not build at all. They
> lived in caves, or, if in the open, in huts made by bending branches
> over and covering then with sods of turf. Consequently in folktales
> they are alway\~ represented as either emerging from caverns or from
> under mounds Such slightly constructed residences--much like those of
> the Lapps--would disappear completely after desertion.

> This Little People are represented in folklore as peevish an
> unreliable; often as good humoured, at other times as vindictive.

> The Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and German names for them are Alf Elf, Aib,
> Ell. In mediaeval poems in German the Will-o'-the-Wisps called Elbisch
> Feuer, the Elfish fire. We find among the Anglo-Saxons both men's
> names and also place names that show that this race was then known and
> respected. Elfric is the Power of the Elf and is the same as Aifric.
> Alfred is the Peace of the Aif. We hav\~ places such as Elimoor,
> Eildon, Elphinstone, Alphington is the tur of a family that did not
> disdain to claim descent from the Alfs Elton is the tun of the Elf,
> and Allerton the residence of a colony of them. \[a\] Elberish is the
> Gnome king in the Nibelungenlied, th Auberon of French legend, the
> Oberon of the romancers. Ii Germany, the Elle king has been turned
> into Erie king by Goethe.

> The earliest and purest account of the Elves is obtained from th
> Icelandic Edda and Sagas. An Alvismal or poem of the Elf has beer
> preserved from pagan times. It is true that the small people never
> penetrated to Iceland, but the Icelanders brought away with them tc
> Iceland the traditions, songs, stories and superstitions of Norway\~
> from, which they emigrated.

> According to the testimony of several sagas, there dwelt in Sweden, in
> remote times, a gigantic, wild race called Jotuns; bul when the
> Scandinavians arrived there arose between them and thc Jotuns a war
> that lasted for many centuries. At last these were driven into the
> forests and mountains, and away to the frozen nortI\~ about the Gulf
> of Finland, which thenceforth was called Jotunheim.

> These, I can hardly doubt, were the builders of the rude stone
> monuments in the south of Sweden, in Denmark, and in Jutland that
> possibly still retains their name.

> But there was a distinct species of Mountain Trolls, or Dwarfs. These
> were good mechanics and cunning, their wives and daughters were often
> beautiful. "This Dwarf race", Mr Thorpe thinks, "seems to spring from
> a people that had migrated from the Eastern Countries at a later
> period, as they were acquainted with names which they used in sorcery,
> accompanied by the harp. A similar art of enchanting and bewitching
> the Laplanders are supposed to possess even to the present day, and
> with some probability it may be conjectured that the Asiatic people,
> who in the sagas are mentioned under the name of Dwarfs, was no other
> than an immigration of oriental Lapps, and the origin of the race
> among us which Still bears that name."

> The Scandinavians distinguished between the Light Elves and the Black
> Elves or Dwarfs. The former lived in mounds and the latter in caves;
> but in all probability the distinction existed not in blood, but in
> mode of habitations. Just as to this day there are the shore Lapps and
> the mountain Lapps.

> Popular fancy has idealised the Light Elves into merry beings that
> dance their ringlets on the grass, and because their original
> habitations have collapsed altogether they have transferred them to
> the tumuli of the incinerated dead. But with these latter they had
> nothing to do. The barrow is a substititute for the turf-covered hovel
> that perished without leaving a trace.

> There is one difficulty in identifying the Elves and Dwarfs with the
> Lapps, and that is the fact that the Dwarfs are regarded, and have
> been regarded, as accomplished metal workers, especially
> sword--smiths, whereas no such an art exists among the Lapps of today.
> It is, however, possible enough that a migration into Europe of
> iron--working Lapps may have taken place, just as the Gipsies came in
> and engrossed at one time the trade of pottery and of tin-ware makers.
> And what is abundantly clear from the sagas is that the Norsemen were
> not accomplished smiths. Their swords blunted directly or broke; and
> they were fain to apply to the Dwarfs to supply them with
> finely-tempered blades. How to temper them in oil the Norsemen knew
> not. If they could not get a sword from a Dwarf they dug into the
> mounds of dead heroes to obtain blades they were themselves
> incompetent to manufacture. One would suppose that such weapons cannot
> have been very serviceable corroded as they would be by rust. All the
> notable swords were of elfin or dwarf make--such were Mimung,
> Excalibur, Durandal, Nageiring, and the famous Tyrfing. The story of
> this latter may here be told in brief. It is contained in one of the
> finest and wildest of the sagas. Svafurlami, second in descent from
> Odin, King of Gardarik (Russia), was out hunting one day, but could
> find no game. When the sun set, he was in the depths of the forest and
> knew not his way out. Then he observed two Dwarfs standing before a
> hill. He drew his sword and dashed in between them and their abode.
> They pleaded to be allowed to escape, but he asked of them their
> names, and they replied that the one was named Dyrin and the other
> Dvallin. Then he knew that they were the most skilful of all workers
> in iron, that a sword fashioned by them would never rust; it would cut
> through iron, and secure to him who wielded it certain victory. He
> granted them their lives on condition that they fabricated for him
> such a blade.

> On the appointed day Svafurlami returned; the Dwarfs came forward and
> presented him with the sword. As Dvalin stood in the door he said:
> "This sword will cause the death of a man every time that it is drawn.
> Three of the most infamous acts will be done by it, and it will bring
> about your own ruin." At that Svafurlami smote at the dwarf, and the
> blade cut into the hard rock. But the sword was his; he named it
> Tyrfing, bore it in every battle, and with it slew the giant Thiassi
> and took his daughter to wife, and had by her a daughterEyvor

> One day he was engaged in conflict with the Berserk \[b\] Arngrim, who
> bore a shield lined with plates of steel. Svafurlami with Tyrfing
> smote through it, but with the force of the blow the blade entered the
> soil; as he stooped to withdraw it, Arngrim dexterously twisted it,
> and with it clove the king from head to foot. Then he carried off
> Eyvör and married her. By Eyvor he became the father of twelve sons,
> the eldest named Angantyr, the fourth HjOrvard. To Angantyr was given
> the sword Tyrfing. Now, it was customary at Yule for champions to take
> oath what they would achieve in the coming year, and Hjörvard swore
> that he would win Ingjbord, daughter of Yngvi, King of Sweden.
> Accordingly all the brothers went to Upsala and demanded the king's
> daughter for Hjörvard. To this objected Hjaltmar, a champion of Yngvi,
> and it was decided that at a given date the brothers should meet
> Hjaltmar and his companion, Odd, on the lone island of Samsey, and
> decide by battle who should win the maid. Before the appointed day the
> brothers visited a friendly Earl Bjartmar, where Angantyr celebrated
> his wedding with the earl's daughter. The fight took place, all the
> brothers and Hjaltmar were slain, and Odd buried the sons of
> Svafurlami along with their weapons in a great mound. Angantyr left an
> only child, a daughter named Hervör, who dressed herself as a man,
> went on Viking expeditions, and visited the island of Samsey with full
> purpose to recover the sword Tyrfing, that was buried with her father.
> A weird account is given of how at night she sought the grave--mound
> and sang strophes to her father, demanding the surrender of the
> Dwarfs' blade. To this, from his grave, Angantyr replies and objects
> to be parted from it. But finally the daughter prevails. The
> grave--mound gapes, and from amidst lambent flames the sword is flung
> towards her. Having obtained possession of Tyrfing, she went to the
> Court of King Gudmund, where one day she had laid aside the scabbard
> with Tyrfing in it, whilst playing dice with the king. A retainer of
> Gudmund ventured to draw the sword and obtain command of it, whereupon
> HervOr sprang up, seized the blade, and cut the man down. Eventually
> Hervör resumed her female habit and married the son of Gudmund, by
> whom she had two sons, Angantyr and Heidrek. The elder was
> peace-loving and amiable, but the younger was malevolent and
> quarrelsome, and became so intolerable at home that his father
> banished him. On leaving, his mother handed to him Tyrfing. As he
> left, his brother Angantyr accompanied him part way. Heidrek drew the
> sword to admire it, when, as the sun flashed on the blade, the Berserk
> rage came on him and he cut down his brother. Heidrek went on, joined
> the Vikings, and as he served King Harald many a good turn he was
> given in marriage the king's daughter Helga. The destiny of Tyrfing
> must be fulfilled, and with it Harald fell by the sword under the hand
> of his son--in--law. Later, Heidrek went to Russia, where he took the
> king's son in charge as his foster--child. One day when out hunting
> together the pair were parted from their retinue, when a wild boar
> appeared. Heidrek's spear broke against the tusks of the beast,
> whereupon he drew his sword and killed it. But Tyrfing could only be
> satiated with human blood. Heidrek turned round, but seeing no other
> man present save his foster-son, slew him. Finally, he was himself
> transfixed with Tyrfing by his slaves, when he was asleep, and had
> suspended the fateful weapon over his bed. His son and successor,
> Angantyr, slew the murderers and recovered the sword. In a battle
> against the Huns, in which Angantyr was engaged, it committed great
> execution, but among the slain Angantyr found his own brother Hlodr.
> Thus ends the story of the Dwarf-fabricated sword Tyrfing.

> The introduction of iron into Europe came comparatively late, far
> earlier in some parts than in others. Even among the Hebrews bronze
> was much more familiar as a metal than iron. In the four first books
> of Moses bronze is mentioned eighty--three times, and iron only four
> times. India is rich in iron ore, but in its early literature iron is
> only certainly mentioned at the close of the Vaidic period, and then
> it is called "dark-blue copper", the contrary to the South African
> Kafirs, who call copper "red" iron, gold "yellow" and silver "white"
> iron.

> In the midst of the sixth century before our era, the work of the
> blacksmith was strange and excited great curiosity. Herodotus tells a
> story of a Spartiot who went to Jegaea, in Arcadia, and saw a smith at
> work, for the first time, with the utmost amazement. There were, in
> fact, no beds of iron ore in Greece, and all iron was brought to it
> from the East. The most famous and unsurpassed ironworkers who
> produced steel weapons were the Chalybii of the Caucasus, sometimes
> placed in the north of the range, sometimes to the south, but always
> close to the Black Sea. Their fame was spread through all the ancient
> world, and to the present day it is stated there is a Caucasian tribe
> that devotes itself to iron work and supplies the other tribes with
> weapons.

> In the *Seven against Thebes* of Aeschylus, the brothers were slain
> "with the hammer -wrought Scythian steel."

> Into Italy the use of iron arrived earlier than into Greece, and the
> Ligurians in the north-west of the peninsula were supposed to be of
> Greek origin, because that even in historic times they employed bronze
> lance-heads.

> Among the northern inhabitants of Europe it was a much longer time
> before they became acquainted with iron. Tacitus informs us how rare
> it was among the Germans in his time (A.D.100), and Caesar, when he
> set foot in Britain, found the island well peopled, with abundance of
> cattle, and instead of coins using bits of bronze or iron of various
> weights. In the interior of the land tin was found, and iron, but in
> small quantities, on the coast. The Britons had no knowledge of
> alloying copper with tin, consequently all the bronze they had in use
> was imported. It would seem from this that as yet the Britons knew
> nothing of the making of steel, or using iron in any other way than as
> a currency.

> It was even worse in the north-east of Europe. The Stonians, a
> Lettish-Prussian people, for hundreds of years of our present
> reckoning used iron as a rarity, and as weapons employed wooden clubs.
> The Finns at the same time pointed their snears and arrows with bone
> "through deficiency of iron" as Tacitus says.

> A curious story is told us by the Byzantine historian Simocatta. When
> the Emperor Maurice, in A.D. 591, was marching against the Avars on
> the shores of the Sea of Marmara, there were brought to him two
> unarmed men of strange aspect, who carried musical instruments like
> lutes. It was ascertained from them that the Khan of the Avars had
> sent to their people, who lived on the coast of the Baltic, demanding
> aid against the Byzantine Emperor, and they were sent as messengers to
> reply that they were a peaceable people, unaccustomed to wars, and
> unacquainted with the use of iron.

> That the Gauls and Celts, at least on the continent, were acquainted
> with steel weapons is certain from the Hallstadt and La Tène finds.
> The former may safely be said to derive from an Eastern Asiatic
> source, probably from the Chalybii of the Caucasus. The La Tène find
> may, however, be due to indigenous Celtic industry, inspired from the
> same source.

> The importers of Caucasian steel into Europe were the Thracians, who
> with the Illyrians of the same race occupied the northern part of the
> Balkan peninsula from the Bosphorus to the Adriatic. Imports across
> the Bosphorus from Pontux would be numerous, and Thracians and
> Illyrians would be the distributors along the upper course of the
> Danube. These primitive people have been expelled from their lands,
> and driven West by successive waves of invaders from the North, the
> Goths, the Avars, and the Sclaves; and by pressure from the South by
> the Macedonian conquerors and the Greek colonists. But they have left
> their tombs, and these are rich in iron. Bronze was largely in use
> still, but mainly in ornaments. At Glusinac, in Bosnia, on the eastern
> slope of the Romanja-Plantina, is a plateau on which are thousands of
> the graves of these ancient people. They consist of small cairns and
> cover interment of bodies unburnt, with swords, spearheads, and axes,
> ornaments of bronze, beads of glass and amber, tools, knives, pincers,
> etc., of iron and hones.

> The last remains of the ancient Thracians are the Albanians. They were
> a small dark race, probably of Aryan stock, as they so readily
> assimilated Greek culture. The extensive finds at Hallstadt in the
> Salzkammergut pertain to the earliest iron age, when that metal was
> coming into use, but had not as yet supplanted the bronze. The graves
> at Hallstadt contained skeletons outstretched, others burnt, in the
> proportion of 525 skeleton graves to 455 containing the ashes of the
> dead. The remains were of men of moderate size, dolicho-cephalous,
> somewhat prognathous, with retreating foreheads; the type is not that
> of the present inhabitants of this portion of the Alps.

> Although in the Icelandic Sagas Sigmund, the Siegfried of the
> Nibelungenlied, fashions his own sword, it is at the teaching of the
> Elf; and the Scandinavians never appear to have been expert smiths.
> They left the fabrication of swords to the Dwarfs. Nor do we ever hear
> of them as engaged in mining; but the Dwarfs are represented so
> frequently as standing at the mouth of a cave, or as facing into one,
> that we may expect that they were miners as well as armourers.

> The makers of weapons had their trade secrets. From the Wilkina Saga
> we learn that Welent, who is none other than Velund, was set to
> fabricate a sword for King Nidung. For this purpose he mixed raspings
> of iron with meal, which he made into a paste, wherewith he fed the
> geese. He then collected all their droppings and fashioned the blade
> out of that, and it was so wondrous sharp that it cut through a
> yardlong flock of wool that was thrown into a stream and carried
> against the edge. The Egyptians used to make steel out of meteoric
> iron by heating it in a fire made of camels? dung. The armourers of
> Bagdad took iron filings, mixed it with the food of geese, and from
> their excrement formed the celebrated Damascus blades. The secret must
> have been brought from the East by the first smiths who wandered into
> Northern Europe.

> The Dwarfs and Elves may not have been all of the same stock. What is
> abundantly evident is that the fabrication of iron was not of native
> growth in Northern and Eastern Europe, it was an importation, and if
> imported, it must have been so by a people which was familiar with the
> processes, through the experience of generations. These may have come
> from the Caucasus, and Lapps may have acquired from them the new art.
> Of that we know nothing. But I think we do know enough to say that
> there did exist, in England and generally in the British Isles, in
> Scandinavia and in Germany, a black-smithying people, not of Iberian
> nor of Aryan blood, not found in large numbers nor forming big
> colonies, but vagrant and dispersed as are the gipsies of the present
> day. And I suspect that it is this people who have occasioned the
> stories told of pixies, kobolds, brownies, elves, etc. Such a people,
> shy, living a different life from, those for whom they worked, were
> sure to excite imagination and give rise to fantastic stories. They
> were feared as well as respected. They do not seem ever to have been
> ill--treated; they were too valuable to be molested. Indeed, as
> already instanced, they entered occasionally into marriage relations
> with the settled inhabitants. The family of Alversleben, in the north
> of Germany, takes its name from an ancestor who spent much of his time
> with the elves under a green mound.

> But if there were workers in iron and makers of steel blades, there
> must have been also miners, who not only used such iron as was found
> in sand and morass, but who tracked it in veins in the rock. I do not
> think that we have much evidence that the Aryans did this. But such as
> the Chalibii, acquainted with iron in all its conditions, would become
> miners. And tradition throughout Northern Europe indicates that these
> were the dwarfs. In Germany, in Cornwall, and Devon existed, and to
> some extent exists to this day, the belief that there are Trolls,
> little old men who work in mines, who are occasionally seen by the
> miners, but are more often heard by them, hammering in the underground
> adits. If they hear them now, it is because they have heard from their
> grandsires that such underground Little People did work. There exist
> many ancient mines in which iron tools are found. They never extend
> very far. But they afford proof that at some remote period there were
> miners by profession, hereditary miners maybe, of a different stock
> from those who are now engaged in the same work.

> In Cornwall the stories of the Little Folk workers in mines have
> passed from those who sought iron ore to those who followed the veins
> of tin. But there miners often see them. Mr Hunt says: "A tinner told
> my informant that he had often seen them sitting on pieces of timber,
> or tumbling about in curious attitudes, when he came to work. Miners
> do not like the form of the cross being made underground. A friend of
> my informant, going through some level or adits, made a X by the side
> of one, to know his way back, as he would have to return by himself.
> He was compelled to alter it into another form." This is interesting,
> as everywhere the Dwarfs are regarded as hostile to Christianity, and
> are represented in many places as migrating because they cannot endure
> the sound of church bells calling to prayer. Who first sought out the
> veins of iron? Who but such as had known where to find it, and what
> its characteristics were as ore? The natives of the Caucasus were the
> originators of steel manufacture, but the art was acquired from them
> by other tribes.

> The working in iron, and in consequence to mining for iron, seems in
> former times, and to a certain extent to the present day, to be
> specialised in particular tribes. It is so in Africa. There are tribes
> whose whole energies are devoted thereto. Neighbouring tribes knew
> nothing about the process. They buy ready-made weapons and tools of
> these ironworkers.

> In Ceylon and India the steel manufacture is confined to certain
> classes. For the perfecting of a good blade, infinitely hard and
> flexible, the smith will devote an amount of labour and time which we
> should think thrown away. He tempers the blade in oil not twenty or
> thirty times, but twice that amount, till he is satisfied that it has
> attained the perfection he desires. When we read in the Scandinavian
> Sagas of the digging into old grave-mounds in quest of swords that had
> been manufactured by Dwarfs, we are forced to the conviction that such
> blades, if good for anything, must have been thus oil-tempered again
> and again in the manufacture, and so only could have withstood rust.

> The knowledge of iron came to the Greeks about 1200 B.C. and iron
> weapons and implements were carried up the Danube by Scythian nomadic
> dealers. A great centre of early iron manufacture would seem to have
> been in Illvria arid Thrace. but who the ironworkers were who
> travelled in the north of Europe and in Britain we do not know.

> A few characteristic stories of this people must suffice. A man rose
> one morning on the way from Apenrade to Jordkirch by the "Three
> hills". He heard hammering going on vigorously in one. So he shouted
> that he wanted a chaff--cutter, and rode on his way. In the evening,
> on his return, he saw a brand--new chaff--cutting knife lying on the
> side of the hillock. He put down its value and carried it off. It
> proved to be of unwonted sharpness, but also that a cut or wound dealt
> by it never healed. On the estate of Dollrott, in Schleswig, when one
> lies down on a green tumulus that exists there, one can hear work
> going on underground. It is the same with the Great Struchberg near
> Heiligenhafen, when one places an ear to the ground the hammering at a
> smithy can be heard.

> It seems to be a general opinion that the Little People must be
> treated with fairness, that any act of treachery done to them or
> neglect is bitterly resented.

> Two serving-girls in Tavistock said that the pixies were very kind to
> them, and would drop silver for them into a bucket of clean water,
> which they took care to place for them in the chimney-corner every
> night. Once it was forgotten, and the pixies forthwith went up to the
> girls' room and loudly complained of the neglect. One of them, who
> happened to be awake, jogged the other, and proposed going down to
> rectify the omission, but she said, "for her part she would not stir
> out of bed to please all the pixies in Devonshire." The other went
> down and filled the bucket, in which, by the way, she found next
> morning a handful of silver pennies. As she was returning, she heard
> the pixies debating how they might punish the other, and they agreed
> to give her a lame leg for a term of seven years, then to be cured by
> a herb growing on Dartmoor, whose name of seven syllables she could
> not recall. Next morning, Molly, the lazy wench, arose dead lame, and
> so continued till the end of the period, when, one day, as she was
> picking up a mushroom a strange--looking boy started up and insisted
> on striking her leg with a plant which he held in his hand. He did so,
> and she was cured. and became the best dancer in the town.

> The people of Jutland declare that when God cast the rebellious angels
> out of heaven, some fell down on the mounds or barrows and became
> Hill--folk; others fell into the elf-moors and became Elf-folk; and
> others, again, fell into dwellings and became House-kobolds. This
> gives a rough idea of the distinction supposed to exist among these
> Little People.

> The enormous number of traditions that tell of the brownies, kobolds,
> or pixies doing service in houses and farms point to a reminiscence of
> when this dispersed and unsettled Little People did great help to
> farmers and their wives for some small recompense.

> One feature attends all the stories about them--the love of
> independence they possessed, their intolerance at being watched.

> In the early part of the nineteenth century there were numerous dwarfs
> called Heinzelmen who did all sorts of work in the city of Cologne.
> They baked bread, washed, and did any sort of domestic labour, for
> which they expected to be paid with a bowl of sweet milk, into which
> white bread had been broken. At that time there were many bakers who
> kept no apprentices, for the Little People used always to make
> overnight as much black and white bread as the bakers wanted for their
> shops; and in many households they scoured the coppers, swept the
> hearths, and washed up the utensils for the maids. This went on till a
> tailor's wife, who had been especially favoured by the Heinzelmen,
> overcome with curiosity, resolved on having a peep at them.
> Accordingly she strewed peas up and down the stairs, so that they
> might fall and hurt themselves, and she might get a sight of them next
> morning. But the project missed, and since that time the Heinzelmen
> have totally disappeared.

> They can also be driven away by one being over-generous to them.

> In Scotland the brownie is the same as the German kobold and the
> Devonshire Pixy: a personage of small stature, wrinkled visage, and
> wearing a brown mantle and hood. His residence is in the hollow of an
> old tree, a ruined castle, or the abode of man. He is attached to
> certain families, with whom he has been known to reside, even for
> centuries, threshing the corn, cleaning the house, doing everything
> done by his English, German and Scandinavian brethren. He expects to
> be paid with a bowl of cream, or some fresh honeycomb, laid for him in
> a corner.

> A good woman had just made a web of linsey-woolsey, and prompted by
> her kindly nature, had manufactured from it a mantle and hood for her
> little brownie. Not content with laying the gift in one of his
> favourite spots, she indiscreetly called to tell him it was there.
> This was too direct, and brownie quitted the place, crying,--"

> A new mantle, and a new hood;

> before 1588.

> Coming to a farmer's house, he takes a liking to a "good handsome
> maid" that was there, and in the night does her work for her at
> breaking hemp and flax, bolting meal, etc. Having watched one night
> and seen him at work, and observed that he was rather bare of clothes,
> she provided him with a waistcoat against the next night. But when he
> saw it, he started and said:--

> Because thou layest me hempen hempen,  
> I will neither bolt nor stampen:  
> 'Tis not your garments, new or old,  
> That Robin loves; I feel no cold.

> Had you left me milk or cream,  
> You should have had a pleasing dream:  
> Because you left no drop or crumb,  
> Robin never more will come.

> Where a condition of affairs existed connected with a people of
> foreign race, misunderstood, looked on with superstitious fears, whose
> very ways encouraged mistrust, it is no wonder that stories concerning
> them should be wild and fantastic. Not only so--but that many a myth
> connected with beings pertaining to a religion superseded by
> Christianity was certain to adhere to them and assist in making them
> nebulous and extravagant; that is what one would expect to take place.
> Have any burials of this people been discovered? I will not say that
> they have not; but they have not been discriminated, not looked for.

> In September 1900, I received a summons to go to Padstow in Cornwall,
> as at Harlyn Bay near there a prehistoric necropolis had been
> discovered in blown sand that had been carried some way inland and was
> hard compacted. A gentleman had bought a field there, and was about to
> build a house. I found that he was impatient to get his dwelling ready
> before winter, or, at all events, have the foundations and walls got
> on with, and he would not allow a slow and careful exploration. It had
> to be done in a hurry. What was more, and even worse, the fact of the
> discovery got into the Cornish and Devon papers. The season was that
> of tourists. The owner charged sixpence a head for visitors, and they
> came in swarms, pushing everywhere, poking about the skeletons and
> skulls with their umbrellas and parasols, scrabbling in the graves in
> quest of "finds", and from the moment this rabble appeared on the
> scene no work could be done save protection of what had already been
> uncovered. A more distressing and disappointing exploration could not
> be imagined. However, some points were determined.

> More than a hundred graves were uncovered; they were composed of boxes
> of slate in which the skeleton sat crouched, mainly, but not
> exclusively, on the right side. Some were of females, some of mothers
> with their infants in their arms. No skull was discovered that
> indicated death through violence, and all skeletons were complete.
> Some of the coffins were in layers, one above another; rudely
> speaking, they pointed east and west, the heads being to the west; but
> what governed the position seemed to be the slope of the hill, that
> fell away somewhat steeply from the south to the north.

> Some bronze fibulae were found, finely drawn armlets of bronze wire
> making spiral convolutions about the wrist, a necklace of very small
> amber and blue glass beads strung on this bronze wire; a good deal of
> iron so corroded that, what with the friability and the meddlesomeness
> of the visitors, who would finger everything exhumed, it was not
> possible to make out more than that they did not represent fragments
> of weapons.

> The fibulae were exhibited in London by Mr Charles H. Read, and
> described in the *Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries* (vol xxi,
> pp 272-4). They are of the crossbow type, not British, their nearest
> analogues are found in the Iberian Peninsula. The pin of the brooch
> was perfect when found, but not so when Mr Read saw it, and he wrongly
> describes it. He considered the Harlyn interments to date from about
> the third century B.C.

> There were found at the time a great many needles and prongs of slate,
> which were afterwards exhibited on the spot and sold to tourists as
> stone spearheads. They were no such thing. They were splinters of a
> soft local slate that had been rolled by the wind and grated by the
> sand into the shape they assumed, and such are found all through the
> district.

> Dr Beddoe came down and examined the skulls and skeletons. He
> considered the interments to be late, and of a race somewhat short in
> stature, with dolicho-cephalic skulls, not prognathous. "We may
> conjecture with some confidence that it was after the Gallo-Belgic and
> before the Roman Conquest." There were marked peculiarities in the
> skulls, distinguishing them from those of the Aryan Celt and from
> those of the men of the Bronze period. It seemed to me that a
> necropolis of an intrusive people, peaceable, who, whereas all around
> them burnt their dead, continued religiously to inter theirs.

> The main road from Padstow along the coast cuts through this ancient
> cemetery. It is interesting to note that this portion of the road has
> ever been dreaded by passengers at night as haunted. On the right hand
> of the way, coming from Padstow, probably more of the necropolis
> remains, and it is earnestly to be desired that it may at some time be
> scientifically examined, without the intrusion of the ignorant and
> vulgar being permitted. The digging proceedings at Harlyn, as soon as
> the season was ending, were broken up by a storm and change of
> weather. The tent was blown down and utterly wrecked. In the following
> year no opportunity was accorded for the prosecution of the
> researches.

> I think that the Harlyn exploration affords sufficient grounds to make
> antiquaries careful in examining graves, and caution in classification
> in the broad categories of prehistoric, Celtic, Saxon and Roman.

> To what stock an intrusive people--widely dispersed and never
> collected into towns, villages, or hamlets, but migrating through the
> land, like the gipsies--belonged is what cannot yet be determined.
