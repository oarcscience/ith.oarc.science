Chapter Eight

Skulls

 

> In medieval churches, castles, and mansions where there is a parapet
> rising from the wall and obscuring a portion of the roof, this parapet
> is supported at intervals by corbels, that usually represent heads of
> either men or beasts, very frequently grotesque. These corbels are not
> of any great structural importance, though they add to architectural
> decoration. They are, in fact, a perpetuation of a traditional usage
> earlier than the construction of buildings of stone. When buildings
> such as halls were erected of wood, and even later, when the walls
> were of masonry, the lye beams of the roof projected beyond the
> supporting walls. These tye beams sustained the principals and the
> king-post, and rested on the wall-plate. Such was the earliest and
> simplest form of roof, and it is one that remained in use till Norman
> times. The stability of the roof depended on the tye beam, which,
> where it protruded beyond the walls, was sawn off against the grain,
> and was there most vulnerable, subject to the drive of the weather,
> and liable to rot. For its protection skulls were hung upon these
> extremities; and when stone buildings came to be erected with parapets
> upon them, then under the string--course that marked the wall--plate
> corbels were added, and the place of the skulls was supplied by stone
> figures representing the heads of men or beasts. This was not the case
> only in Gothic architecture; the same adaptation or modification may
> be seen in that of Greece and Rome, where the skull, mainly of an ox,
> forms a principal feature in the ornament of an external cornice, and
> seems to indicate that in early days the heads of the victims
> sacrificed were thus employed.

> Nowadays the sportsman nails up the skulls and antlers of the stags he
> has shot, or the masks of foxes he has hunted, in his hail; but in
> Bavaria and Austria they still decorate the exterior as well as the
> interior of the shooting-lodge. There exists naturally in every
> sportsman an ambition to bring home and exhibit some trophy of his
> exploits; and as at the present day his energies and barbarous
> instincts are confined to the slaying of wild animals, it is only the
> heads of wild animals that he can display to his own satisfaction and
> that of admiring friends.

> But it was otherwise when war was the great occupation of man and his
> great enjoyment. Then he preserved the heads of his enemies killed in
> fair fight; and after they had been efficiently dried, he hooked them
> onto the ends of the tye beams of his house, or dangled them inside
> against his walls, and was able to yarn to his comrades over each, and
> tell all the incidents of the fight, and display his superior courage
> or adroitness. Every single head provided a theme for a story on a
> winter's evening, and every head pointed out proved conclusively that
> the story was fact and not fiction.

> The head-hunting of the Dyak of Borneo is but a degraded and
> despicable survival. A girl will not marry a native till he has some
> heads to show. Accordingly he lurks among the rushes till the girls
> come down to the riverside for their ablutions, when he dashes among
> them and cuts off as many heads as he can secure victims. Such
> trophies are worthless as evidences of his heroism, but they pass and
> are accepted.

> "I have cut off four heads," said a Dyak to his fellow.

> "I seven."

> Thus a missionary in Borneo overheard two natives conversing. And a
> few weeks later the second was dead. His village friends hooked his
> body out of the river. But it was now headless. Then they knew, and
> the missionary also knew, that now the other owned five heads.

> The reason why only the skulls are preserved is that this is
> comparatively easy. The body itself decays and moulders, and is thus
> not only difficult to preserve but also has the repulsive properties
> of soft corrupting flesh, whereas it is always easy to keep the skull.
> But even that may be felt too cumbrous, and the North American Indian
> contented himself with a scalp as a trophy; and the ancient fish chief
> extracted the brain of his slain enemy, mixed it with chalk, rolled it
> into a ball, and so preserved a trophy of his prowess.

> Jehu had the seventy sons of Ahab beheaded in Samaria and set up in
> two heaps at the entrance of the palace of Jezreel, and I have seen a
> photograph of such piles before the doorway of the Bey of Tunis. The
> last exhibition of heads as a decoration was over Temple Bar, when
> those of the Jacobite rebels of 1746 were set up there on iron rods.
> They remained there till 1772, when one of them fell down in a storm,
> and the others soon followed. Previous to the Rebellion of 1745, for
> about thirty years, Temple Bar exhibited the head of a barrister named
> Layer, who had been executed for a Jacobite conspiracy soon after
> Atterbury's plot.

> The stone balls that adorn the gateposts into a manorial park
> actually, it is believed, represent heads, and were set up to show
> that the lord of that manor possessed right to pronounce capital
> sentences. But now they are on the gateposts of every petty suburban
> villa. At Görlitz, north of the Riesen Gebirge, in the marketplace
> above the town hail, are iron rods or spikes; halfway up each is a
> ball, to represent a head that has fallen under the sword of the city
> executioner. When I was a boy at Pau, in the South of France, there
> was a house in the Grande Place that had been erected by a retired
> executioner who had had lively times during the Reign of Terror. Along
> the front was a balustrade for a parapet, and at intervals stone
> balls, and these were said to represent the number of heads that he
> had cut off with the guillotine.

> Although among the Aryans human sacrifice was not common, I do not
> find any evidence that the heads of the victims were made use of as
> ornaments. This was a privilege reserved for warriors who had fallen
> in battle. Nor were slaves decapitated for this purpose, though very
> frequently sacrificed.

> It is, however, other in Africa. In certain tribes a man's dignity
> depends on the number of heads of slaves he has had decapitated and
> which he can show.

> In the North-West Congo, a rich man of the Babangi tribe endeavours to
> send forward a number of his attendants as outrunners to provide
> comfortable quarters for himself and to minister to his convenience
> when he arrives. He calls together all his attendants to a great feast
> of palm-wine and fish. But eating and drinking are only the
> preliminaries to the real business that has to be transacted--the
> sacrifice of a slave. The actual victim is not announced beforehand,
> the essential reason being that he has to be taken out of the midst of
> the revellers and then and there consigned to death.

> Before the residences of well-to-do Babangi are tables laden with
> skulls, some blanched, others still with the skin about them and in a
> condition of putrefaction. The black gentleman conducts his admiring
> and envious guest about the table and points out to him what a large
> retinue he will possess in the other world. He fully understands that,
> when he is dead, his legal successors will grudge sending human
> victims after him. Their view rather is: "Why should we send slaves to
> the man in the other world, when we ourselves shall want them to
> provide for our comfort hereafter?"

> The custom among the Scandinavians and others of the Aryan race of
> drinking out of skulls of their enemies is but another instance of
> disregard of the human frame, a purposeful exhibition of contempt for
> the skull.

> The earliest instance is in the Eddaic lay of Viglund or Veluni, the
> same as the English Wayland the Smith. That the story was familiar to
> our Anglo--Saxon forefathers we know, because Alfred the Great refers
> to it. It was also well known in Germany.

> Viglund was a smith who lived by the side of a lake in the realms of
> Niduth, King of Sweden. Hearing of his great skill, Niduth and his men
> visit the hut whilst the smith is absent, and find a number of gold
> rings strung together. They take one. On Viglund's return he finds
> that one is missing; nevertheless he goes to sleep, but on waking he
> is surrounded and taken prisoner. The queen, mistrusting the man, has
> him hamstrung. The king sets him on an island in a lake, and bids him
> make gold and silver ornaments for him and fashion steel weapons.
> Niduth had two sons, whom he strictly forbade going near the forge.
> They were, however, inquisitive, and did visit it, and persuaded
> Viglund to show them what he had made.

> Viglund dazzled their eyes with his work, and promised to give them of
> it if on the following day they would return with the utmost secrecy.
> They agreed and went, whereupon Viglund murdered them both, sunk their
> bodies in a morass, but chased their skulls in silver and formed out
> of them two drinking--bowls for the king. He set the boys' eyes in
> gold and sent them to the queen as brooches, and the teeth of her
> brothers he made into a necklace for their sister. The story is
> extremely barbarous, and, as it can be traced even to Greece, it
> probably forms part of a legend told prior to the Aryan dispersion.
> The necklace of teeth is a specially early trait.

> Should love and devotion, and the effort to maintain relations with
> the departed, triumph over fear, then the reverse process to the
> getting rid of the dead ensued. The dead were preserved at least in
> part. As, however, the children of Nature are always wavering between
> fear and respect for the dead, so also all burial rites oscillate
> between the destruction and the preservation of the body. Thus it
> happens that extremely opposite sentiments give rise to most
> complicated practices and conceptions, which are frequently in
> flagrant contradiction with one another.

> Be that as it may. I think that what we shall see in Europe of
> inconsistencies is due to there having been in it the Aryan race,
> which placed little value on the body, but esteemed the soul as the
> essential quality of personality; and on the other hand, the
> Rude--Stone--Monument Builders, who had no conception of the soul as
> apart from the body, and whose religion consisted not in animism at
> all, but in ancestor worship, this is to say, of the ancestor buried
> in his cairn or dolmen.

> We know that periodically a family or tribe opened the ancestral tomb
> and scraped and cleaned the bodies of their forebears. We know this,
> because we can trace the scratches made on their bones with flint
> scrapers, as also, because not having a perfect knowledge of anatomy,
> they sometimes replaced the bones wrongly, as the tibia of the right
> leg placed on the left side. We know also, from actual finds, that a
> loving widow would occasionally secure the skull of the late lamented
> and suspend it round her neck; or if not the entire skull, yet a
> portion of it, prized as an inestimable treasure, as it kept her in
> some relation with him whom she had lost.

> It is remarkable how completely the Roman Church has surrendered to
> the usages of the primeval man in the cult of relics. I have seen
> repeatedly above altars in Switzerland and Tyrol grinning skulls under
> glass forming the most conspicuous object of adoration above an altar.
> The builder of megalithic monuments has passed away, or been absorbed
> by nobler and more intelligent peoples, but his worship of the dead
> remains intact; the only difference being that the devotion is no
> longer offered to the skull of an ancestor, but to that of a more or
> less fictitious saint. I suppose that the officials are in some places
> becoming a little ashamed of this, for at St Ursula's, Cologne, where
> a few years ago the space above the arches and below the clerestory
> windows was crowded with small boxes containing skulls, they have of
> late years been placed under curtains. But the sacristy still
> maintains the appearance of a charnal-house.

> It is significant how the cult of images and relics disappeared out of
> England and Scotland without leaving a trace, or only the faintest.

> At Llandeilo, under the Presilly Hills, in South Wales, is a holy well
> of St Teilo; and in the farmhouse hard by, Mr Melchior, the tenant,
> preserves the brainpan of the skull that was shown and used before the
> Reformation as that of the saint. He is the hereditary guardian of the
> relic. Unhappily for its genuineness, the open sutures prove that it
> must have been the head of a young person, and as Teilo died at an
> advanced age, it could not have belonged to him. Moreover, a part of
> the superciliary ridge remains, and this is of slight elevation, so
> that it seems almost certain to have been a portion of a young woman's
> head. Patients drank water till quite recently from the well out of
> the reputed skull, and many cures are recorded.

> At Skaiholt, in Iceland, was preserved and venerated the supposed
> skull of St Thorlac, till on examination it proved to be a cocoanut
> that had been washed up in one of the fjords.

> But if there remains but the most meagre trace of the worship of
> saintly relics in England, there remain tokens of what appears to have
> been at a remote period a veneration for the heads of ancestors or
> founders of houses.

> Near Launceston is the ancient house of Tresmarrow that belonged to
> Sir Hugh Piper, Governor of Launceston Castle under Charles I. By the
> marriage of Philippa, daughter and heiress of Sir Hugh, the house and
> property passed into the Vyvyan family; then it passed to a Dr Luke,
> whose wife was a Miss Vyvyan. He sold it to an old yeoman farmer of
> the name of Dawe, and it remained in the Dawe family till about five
> years ago, when it was again sold.

> Now, in a niche in the old buildings for centuries was to be seen a
> human skull. All recollection of whose it was had passed away. One of
> the Dawes, disliking its presence, had it buried, but thereupon ensued
> such an uproar, such mighty disturbances, that it was on the morrow
> dug up again and replaced in its recess. The Dawe family, when they
> sold Tresmarrow, migrated to Canada, and have taken the skull with
> them.

> There was a "screaming skull" at Waddon, in Dorsetshire, about fifty
> years ago, kept respectfully in a recess on the stairs; but as it was
> liable to be fractious and cause disturbances in the house, it was
> given to the Dorchester Museum, where it now is. The story about it is
> that it was the head of a negro, and it bore on it the mark, of a cut
> from a sword. The black man went to his master's room at night, and
> the latter, believing him to be a burglar, killed him by mistake. He
> was killed in the bedroom over the dining-room. The owners of Waddon
> were the Grove family of Zeals, in Wiltshire. When Miss Chafyn Grove
> died some years ago, her cousin, Mr Troyte Bullock, inherited, but
> with the property had to take the name of Chafyn Grove.

> A few miles distant from Waddon is Bettiscombe. Here also is a
> "screaming skull". The house was rebuilt in Queen Anne's reign, but
> the richly carved wainscoting and fine old oak stairs pertain to the
> earlier house that was pulled down when the present mansion was built.
> This was done by Azariah Pinney, who had joined Monmouth's forces, and
> was exiled to the West Indies, he being one of those who escaped
> sentence of death by Judge Jeffreys at the "Bloody Assizes", held at
> Dorchester, after the Rebellion. His life was spared through the
> influence of a friend at the Court of James II. He remained in the
> West Indies for a period of ten years, and then returned with a black
> servant, to whom he was much attached; and then the man died; but
> whether the skull be his, or, if so, why it was preserved above
> ground, none can say. It would seem probable, however, that it was
> taken along with the wainscoting out of the earlier house.

> The prevailing superstition is that, if it be brought out of the
> house, the house itself will rock to its foundations, and the person
> guilty of the sacrilegious act will die within the year. The house had
> remained uninhabited for some years until, about 1760 or 1770, a
> farmer came into occupation. Finding the skull, he declared with an
> oath that he would not have the thing there, and he had it thrown into
> a pooi of water. During that night and the next the farmer heard some
> uncanny noises, and on the third day he said he would have the skull
> back. He did so, and then, as the story goes, all the noises ceased.
> It has been carefully preserved since, and kept in a kind of loft
> under the roof in a cigar box.

> In Looe Island, off East and West Looe, is still, or was a few years
> ago, a skull preserved in a cupboard in the sittingroom, behind glass.
> I have not been able to find any tradition connected with it. Looe
> Island was at one time a great resort of smugglers, till a coastguard
> station was established on it.

> At Warbleton Priory, near Heathfield, in Sussex, were two skulls
> preserved till some few years ago, when they were stolen, greatly to
> the wrath of the proprietor. Legends were told, in the usual way, of
> the hideous cries and wailing that would ensue were they disturbed.
> But there has been no trouble in the house since. Very vague
> traditions remain as to their origin.

> Near Chapel-en-le-Frith, in Derbyshire, is a farmhouse where the skull
> of one called "Dickie" is preserved. A skull in perfect preservation
> is at Higher Chilton Farm, in the village of Chilton Cantelo,
> Somerset. This is the headpiece of one Theophilus Brome, who died in
> 1670, and was buried in the north transept of the church. Collinson,
> in his History of Somerset, referring to Chilton Cantelo and Brome,
> says:--

> There is a tradition in this parish that the person here interred
> requested that his head might be taken off before his burial and be
> preserved at the farmhouse near the church, where a head--chop--fallen
> enough--is still shown, which the tenants of the house have often
> endeavoured to commit to the bowels of the earth, but have as often
> been deterred by horrid noises portentive of sad displeasure; and
> about twenty years since (which was perhaps the last attempt) the
> sexton, in digging the place for the skull's repository, broke the
> spade in two pieces, and uttered a solemn asserveration never more to
> attempt an act so evidently repugnant to the quiet of Brome's Head.

> The truth of the story that the skull preserved in the house is that
> of Theophilus Brome was proved during the restoration of the church,
> some forty-five or fifty years ago, when Brome's tomb was opened and
> the skeleton discovered minus the head.

> Now, we may ask, Why did Brome desire his head to be kept in the
> house? He was assuredly possessed with a traditional idea that it
> would be good for him, or for the household rather, td have his head
> as its guardian and overlooker of the household. Thus the head of Bran
> the Blessed was taken to London and buried where now stands the Tower;
> and it was foretold that so long as it remained there no invasion
> could be made of Britain. In a fit of vainglorious temerity King
> Arthur dug it up, saying that he chose not to hold the island except
> by his own prowess; and I have heard of a Black Forest farmer who
> desired to be buried on a hill commanding his whole land, so that he
> might see to it that the labourers did their work properly. \[a\]

> Ivar the Boneless, King of Northumbria, when dying, ordered his body
> to be planted in a great mound, where he might watch and protect the
> confines of the kingdom, and he declared that Northumbria would not be
> subdued so long as he remains therein. It was said that one reason why
> King Harald Hardrede fell in the battle of Stamford Bridge was that
> Ivar the Boneless was engaged against him. It was further said, later,
> that William the Bastard, when he proceeded north to quell the
> turbulent spirit of the Northumbrians, disinterred the incorrupt body
> of Ivar, had a mighty pile of wood collected, and burned the carcass
> to ashes, after which he set to work in most ruthless fashion to
> devastate Northumbria.

> In Wardley Hall, Lancashire, is preserved the skull of Father Ambrose,
> that is to say, Alexander Barlow, one of the Papist martyrs. For
> saying Mass on Sunday April 25, 1641, he was seized by an infuriated
> mob, led by a Puritan minister, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered
> on September 10. His head was impaled on the tower of the old church,
> Manchester, but was afterwards removed and taken to Wardley Hall,
> where the skull is likely to remain in its accustomed place so long as
> Wardley Hall stands, for a clause is always inserted in leases of the
> house forbidding its removal. Some years ago, when the old house was
> let out in tenements to colliers, an attempt was made to get rid of
> it, but it was said that no peace ensued in the house till it was
> restored. Once it was flung into the moat, which had to be drained to
> recover it.

> And now I come to a case that, if I mistake not, lets in light on the
> subject of these screaming skulls, and explains the reason why they
> exist.

> Burton Agnes is situated in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and the hall
> is a noble structure. The estate, which was anciently owned by the De
> Somervilles, passed in the reign of Edward I to the Griffith family,
> which died out in three co--heiresses, sisters, in the last years of
> Queen Elizabeth. As they were very wealthy, they resolved on
> rebuilding the family mansion in the style of the period, and the
> youngest sister, Anne, took the keenest interest in planning and
> furnishing the hall. When it was complete, the ladies took up their
> abode in it; but one day soon after, Anne was murdered on her way to
> visit some friends by ruffians, then called wood-rangers. for her
> purse and rings. She had been stunned by them by a blow over the head
> with a cudgel, and was carried back to Burton Agnes; but although she
> lingered during five days, she never recovered, and finally died. In
> her last conscious intervals she besought her sisters, when she was
> dead, to sever her head from her body and preserve it in the house
> that had been her delight and pride.

> The two surviving Misses Griffith thought this an absurd request, and
> did not comply with it. But the noises in the house, of things
> falling, of doors slamming, cries and moans, so scared them that they
> had the family vault opened, the head of the sister Anne detached and
> installed in the hall, whereupon the noises ceased.

> The Boyntons of Barmston inherited Burton Agnes by right of descent
> from Sir Matthew Boynton, who married the last surviving of the three
> sisters, and was created a baronet in 1618. The Boyntons had the skull
> buried in the garden; but no luck attended the house and family till
> it was returned to its accustomed place.

> Now, here we have the foundress and fashioner of the house, at her
> particular desire, requiring her skull to be for ever preserved in it;
> undoubtedly like that of Bran, who watched for the interests of
> Britain. When Bran had been wounded in the foot by a poisoned arrow in
> Ireland, he bade the seven survivors of his party cut off his head and
> take it back with them to Wales. He told them that they would sit long
> at dinner at Harlech, where the head would converse with them and be
> as entertaining as it had ever been when attached to the trunk. From
> Harlech they were to proceed to Greshoim, and remain there feasting in
> company with the head so long as they did not open a door that looked
> towards Cornwall. Should they open that door, then they must set out
> for London, and there, on the White Hill, bury it with its face
> towards France; so long as the head remained undisturbed in this
> position, the island would have nothing to fear from foreign invasion.

> There is an fish story also concerning a speaking head. Finn had his
> hunting--lodge in Jeffia. Whilst he was absent, his fool Lomna
> discovered Finn's wife engaged in an intrigue with one Cairbre, and he
> divulged the fact to Finn. Next time that Finn was abroad, Cairbre
> returned to see the lady, and, discovering who had betrayed what he
> had done, cut off Lomna's head and carried it away with him. Finn, in
> the evening, found a headless body in the booth, and at once concluded
> that this was Lomna's, and that Cairbre had been his murderer. He went
> in pursuit, and tracked Cairbre and his party to an empty house, where
> they had been cooking fish on a stone, with Lomna's head on a spike by
> the fire. The first portion cooked was evenly divided by Cairbre among
> his followers; but not a morsel was put within the lips of the head,
> which thereupon chanted an obscure verse of remonstrance. The second
> charge cooked was distributed in the same manner, and again the head
> sang a verse expressive of indignation. Cairbre then said, "Put the
> head outside; it has but evil words for us." No sooner had the order
> been obeyed than the head outside sang a third verse, and Finn and his
> party arrived on the spot.

> In Scandinavian mythology Odin had the head of Mimir, that had been
> cut off, ever by him as guide and adviser.

> In the Arabian Nights is the story of the Greek king and the physician
> whom he has condemned to decapitation. The latter gives the king a
> book, and bids him question his head as to what he wants to know after
> it has been cut off, and it will answer him. In the medieval story of
> Friar Bacon, it is a brazen head that the friar and Bungey fashion,
> and which is to instruct them how to wall England round with brass.
> Through the dullness of the man Miles set to watch it, the favourable
> moment is lost.

> That at some time in the remote past the skull of the ancestor was
> regarded as oracular is possible enough, but we have no evidence to
> that effect. What we have seen has been the survival of the
> preservation of the skull, presumedly of an ancestor, at all events of
> a founder, as a protecting relic, not genius, for no thought of spirit
> enters into it. It is the osseous mass of bone that is the guardian,
> not any soul that once inhabited it.

> I may instance the usages of the natives of the Torres Straits. Here
> the corpse is first laid upon a horizontal frame sustained by posts at
> the corners. The moisture is pressed out, and then after a long time,
> when the bone is everywhere exposed, the head is detached, and the
> rest buried or thrown into the sea, after which some funeral feasts
> ensue. The important part of the ceremony consists in the solemn
> delivery of the skull to the survivors. Sometimes the head is placed
> at night on the old bed of the deceased, so that he seems to be
> sleeping with the family as in his lifetime, till at last. the head of
> the family, or the chief, puts the skull as a pillow under his own
> head. Thenceforth it is treated with great respect and is given a sort
> of hutch in which to rest. One such from the Solomon Islands may be
> seen in the British Museum.

> The few "screaming skulls" in the country may be regarded as the last
> lingering remains of a custom once general, at a still earlier date
> universal. But it is a custom that goes back into the darkest ages of
> mankind--at all events, to that of the Dolmen Builders, who used stone
> weapons, and had not as yet acquired the knowledge of bronze.
