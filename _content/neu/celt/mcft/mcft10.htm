<CENTER><H1>The Farmer of Liddesdale</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
<BR>

  THERE was in
  Liddesdale (in Morven) a Farmer who suffered great loss within the space of
  one year. In the first place, his wife and children died, and shortly after
  their death the Ploughman left him. The hiring-markets were then over, and
  there was no way of getting another ploughman in place of the one that left.
  When spring came his neighbours began ploughing; but he had not a man to hold
  the plough, and he knew not what he should do. The time was passing, and he
  was therefore losing patience. At last he said to himself in a fit of passion,
  that he would engage the first man that came his way, whoever he should be.</P>

  <P>
Shortly after that a man came to the house. The Farmer met him
  at the door, and asked him whither was he going, or what was he seeking? He
  answered that he was a ploughman, and that he wanted an engagement. &quot;I
  want a ploughman, and if we agree about the wages, I will engage thee. What
  dost thou ask from this day to the day when the crop will be gathered
  in?&quot; &quot;Only as much of the corn when it shall be dry as I can carry
  with me in one burden-withe.&quot; &quot;Thou shalt get that,&quot; said the
  Farmer, and they agreed.</P>

  <P>
Next morning the Farmer went out with the Ploughman, and
  showed him the fields which he had to plough. Before they returned, the
  Ploughman went to the wood, and having cut three stakes, came back with them,
  and placed one of them at the head of each one of the fields. After he had
  done that he said to the Farmer, &quot;I will do the work now alone, and the
  ploughing need no longer give thee anxiety.&quot;</P>


<P>
Having said this, he went home and remained
idle all that day. The next day came, but he remained idle as on the day before.
After he had spent a good while in that manner, the Farmer said to him that it
was time for him to begin work now, because the spring was passing away, and the
neighbours had half their work finished. He replied, &quot;Oh, our land is not
ready yet.&quot; &quot; How dost thou think that ? &quot; &quot; Oh, I know it
by the stakes.&quot;</P>


<P>
If the delay of the Ploughman made the Farmer wonder, this
answer made him wonder more. He resolved that he would keep his eye on him, and
see what he was doing.</P>

<P>
The Farmer rose early next morning, and saw the Ploughman going
to the first field. When he reached the field, he pulled the stake at its end
out of the ground, and put it to his nose. He shook his head and put the stake
back in the ground. He then left the first field and went to the rest. He tried
the stakes, shook his head, and returned home. In the dusk he went out the
second time to the fields, tried the stakes, shook his head, and after putting
them again in the ground, went home. Next morning he went out to the fields the
third time. When he reached the first stake he pulled it out of the ground and
put it to his nose as he did on the foregoing days. But no sooner had he done
that than he threw the stake from him, and stretched away for the houses with
all his might.</P>

<P>
He got the horses, the withes, and the plough, and when he
reached the end of the first field with them, he thrust the plough into the
ground, and cried :</P>

    <P>
&quot;My horses and my leather-traces, and mettlesome lads,<BR>

    The earth is coming up! &quot;</P>

<P>
He then began ploughing, kept at it all day at a terrible rate,
and before the sun went down that night there was not a palm-breadth of the
three fields which he had not ploughed, sowed, and harrowed. When the Farmer saw
this he was exceedingly well pleased, for he had his work finished as soon as
his neighbours.</P>


<P>
The Ploughman was quick and ready to do
everything that he was told, and so he and the Farmer agreed well until the
harvest came. But on a certain day when the reaping was over. the Farmer said to
him that he thought the corn was dry enough for putting in. The Ploughman tried
a sheaf or two, and answered that it was not dry yet. But shortly after that day
he said that it was now ready. &quot;If it is,&quot; said the Farmer, &quot; we
better begin putting it in.&quot; &quot;We will not until I get my share out of
it first,&quot; said the Ploughman. He then went off to the wood, and in a short
time returned, having in his hand a withe scraped and twisted. He stretched the
withe on the field, and began to put the corn in it. He continued putting sheaf
after sheaf in the withe until he had taken almost all the sheaves that were on
the field. The Farmer asked of him what he meant ? &quot;Thou didst promise me
as wages as much corn as I could carry with me in one burden-withe, and here I
have it now,&quot; said the Ploughman, as he was shutting the withe.</P>


<P>
The Farmer saw that he would be ruined by the Plough-man and
therefore said:</P>

    <P>
&quot; 'Twas in the M&#224;rt I sowed,<BR>

    'Twas in the M&#224;rt I baked,<BR>

    'Twas in the M&#224;rt I harrowed.<BR>

    Thou VVho hast ordained the three M&#224;rts,<BR>

    Let not my share go in one burden-with.&quot;</P>

<P>
Instantly the withe broke, and it made a loud report, which echo
answered from every rock far and near. Then the corn spread over the field, and
the Ploughman went away in a white mist in the skies, and was seen no more.</P>
