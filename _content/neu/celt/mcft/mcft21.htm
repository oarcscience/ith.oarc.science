  <P>
I HAVE scarcely anything to add to the
  general account of the collection of Celtic Fairy Tales which I gave in the
  predecessor to this volume. Since the appearance of that volume in 1891, the
  publication of such tales has gone on apace. Mr. Curtin has published in the
  New York <I>Sun </I>no less than fifty more Irish fairy tales, one of which he
  has been good enough to place at my disposal for the present volume. Mr.
  Larminie has published with Mr. E. Stock a volume of <I>West Irish Fairy
  Tales, </I>of which I have also the privilege of presenting a specimen. A
  slight volume of Welsh Fairy Tales, published by Mr. Nutt, and a few fairy
  anecdotes contained in the Prize Essay on Welsh Folk-lore by the Rev. Mr.
  Evans, sum up Cambria's contribution to our subject during the past three
  years. The fifth volume of the <I>Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition, </I>just
  about to appear at the moment of writing, is the sole addition to Celtic Fairy
  Tales from the country of J. F. Campbell. Taken altogether, something like a
  hundred previously unpublished tales from Celtdom have been rendered
  accessible to the world since I last wrote, a by no means insignificant
  outcome in three years. It is at any rate clear, that the only considerable
  addition to our folk-lore knowledge in these isles must come from the Gaelic
  area. The time of harvest can be but short ; may the workers be many, willing,
  and capable.</P>

XXVII. THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN OF LIR.</P>

  <P>
<I>Sources</I>.- Abridged from the text and
  translation published by the Society for the Preservation of the Irish
  Language in 1883. This merely follows the text and version given by Professor
  O'Curry in <I>Atlantis, </I>iv. He used three Dublin MSS., none of them,
  however, of earlier date than the eighteenth century. Dr. Joyce gives a free
  paraphrase in his <I>Old Celtic Romances.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Remarks.-The &quot; </I>Fate
  of the Children of Lir&quot; is always referred to along with &quot;The Story
  of Deirdre <I>&quot; (cf </I>the <I>Celtic Fairy Tales, </I>ix.), and the
  &quot;Children of Tuireann&quot; as one of the Three Sorrowful Tales of Erin.
  But there is no evidence of equal antiquity to the other two stories, of which
  one is as old as the eleventh century. From the interspersed verse O'Curry
  concluded, however, that the story was at least of considerable antiquity, and
  the references to the unknown Saint Mochaomhog confirm his impression. The
  Hill of the White Field is near Newton Hannton, in the county of Armagh. The
  Lake of the Red Eye is Lough Derg, in the Shannon above Killaloe.</P>

  <P>
Fingula is Fair Shoulder. The tradition
  that swans are inviolable is still extant in Ireland. A man named Connor
  Griffin killed eleven swans: he had previously been a prosperous man, and
  shortly after. wards his son was drowned in the Shannon, his goods were lost,
  and his wife died <I>(Children of Lir, </I>Dublin edit., note, p. 87). In
  County Mayo it is believed that the souls of pure virgins are after death
  enshrined in the forms of swans ; if anybody injures them, it is thought he
  will die within a year (Walter's <I>Natural History of the Birds of Ireland, </I>pp.94-5).
  Mr. Gomme concludes from this that the swan was at one time a British totem <I>(Arch.
  Rev., </I>iii. 226-7).</P>

  <P>
At first sight the tale seems little more
  than an argument against the Bill for Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister,
  but the plaintive lays of Fingula, the touching detail of the swans flying
  over the desolate hill and White Field, give a touch of Celtic glamour to the
  whole story. There is probably also a deep religious significance implied in
  the fact that the wicked Aunt Stepmother's spell is broken when the
  transformed Children of Lir come across the first Christian they meet.</P>

  <P>
Mr. Nutt has kindly communicated the
  following remarks on this tale:-</P>

  <P>
The Fate of the Children of Lir belongs
  formally to the so-called mythological cycle, the personages of which are the
  Tuatha de Danann. The Irish annalists of the 10th-11th
  centuries described these as members of one of the races which possessed
  Ireland in pre-Christian times before the coming of the Milesians. But even in
  the most strongly euhemerised accounts the mythic nature of these beings is
  apparent, and most modern scholars are agreed that they are in fact the
  members of a Pagan Irish Pantheon. They live on to this very day in Irish
  folk-belief as chiefs and rulers of the fairies.</P>

  <P>
The MS. evidence for some of the stories
  concerning the Tuatha de Danann is as old as that for the oldest heroic cycle
  (the Ultonian of Conchobar and Cuchulainn). But the Tuatha de Danann legends
  have retained throughout Irish literature greater plasticity and vitality than
  those of the Ultonian cycle, and many stories are not older in their present
  state than the 14th and 15th centuries. This is probably the case with the
  present story. The oldest known MS. only goes back to 1718, but this and the
  MS. of 1721, used by O'Curry for hs edition, are certainly copied from much
  older MSS.</P>

  <P>
The interesting question for storiologists
  is whether the themes of the story - the swan-metamorphosis consequent upon
  the step-mother's jealousy, and the protecting role assigned to the sister-are
  of old native or of recent imported nature. In support of the first
  hypothesis, it may be noted that the theme of stepmotherly jealousy was
  current in Ireland in the 10th century at the latest, as it is woven into the
  saga of the Destruction of Daderga's Fort (see my article <I>&quot;Folk-lore,&quot;
  </I>ii.). The final episode of the sudden aging of the miraculously long-lived
  swans is also genuinely Irish, but its true significance is obscured in our
  story in a way that sufficiently demonstrates the late and secondary character
  of the text. The idea is that the dwellers in Faery, whether fairy-folk or
  mortals penetrating thither, enjoy perpetual life, forfeited by the latter the
  moment they return to this earth. As children of the Tuatha de Danann,
  Fionngula and her brothers are deathless, and the episode as it stands in our
  text results from a contamination of the original form of the story in which
  the swan-metamorphosis was annulled under certain conditions (the removal of
  the chains), when the original shape was resumed, and the familiar story of
  the mortal returning from Faery after hundreds of years, which he deems to be
  but a short space of time, shrinking into dust the moment he touches earth.</P>

  <P>
There is a well-known Continental folk-taIe
  - the &quot;Seven Swans&quot; (or Ravens) of which<I> </I>we possess several
  medieval (12th to 13th century) versions, all connected with the romance of
  the &quot;Swan Knight.&quot; M. Gaston Paris has studied the whole story group
  <I>(Romania, </I>xix. 314, &amp;c.) with the following results The folk-tale
  of the seven swans had originally nothing to do with the saga of the
  swan-knight. The connection apparent in the 12th century texts is artificial ;
  the swans owe their shape-shifting capacity to the superhuman nature of their
  mother ; this trait has been almost effaced even in the oldest versions. The
  distinguishing mark of the swans in all the versions is the possession of
  silver or gold chains, which are what may be called metamorphosis tokens ; it
  follows from this that the contamination of the two story-types (&quot;Seven
  Swans&quot; and &quot;Swan Knight&quot;) must be older than the oldest version
  of the first story, as these chains can only be derived from the one with
  which in the Swan Knight saga the swan draws the knight back.</P>

  <P>
In <I>Romania </I>(xxi. 62, <I>seq.</I>)<I>
  </I>M. Ferd. Lot examines the question in the light of our tale. He points out
  that it indicates clearly the super human nature of the mother, and that as
  the silver chains figure in the story, they cannot be due in the Continental
  versions to contamination with the Swan Knight saga, as M. Gaston Paris
  imagines. M. Lot evidently inclines to look upon them as talismans, the
  abandonment of which was the original cause of the metamorphosis, and the
  handling of which at the end brings about the change back to human shape. He
  points out that these chains form an essential part of the gear of beings
  appearing in bird guise (especially if they belong to Faery); thus in the
  10th-century 'Sickbed of Cuchulaion' the goddesses Fand and Liban appear as
  two swans united by a golden chain; in the 8th to 9th century Conception of
  Cuchulainn, Dechtire, the mother of the hero by the god Lug, appears with her
  companions in the guise of many-hued birds linked together by chains of silver
  (or red gold in one version). The MS. evidence for these tales reaches back to
  the early 11th century.</P>

  <P>
Curiously enough, M. Lot has not cited the
  closest parallel to our tale from old Irish literature, and one which is
  certainly connected with it in some measure, the fine story called the
  &quot;Dream of Angus.&quot; A story of this title is cited in the epic catalogue of
  the Book of Leinster (which dates back to the early I ith century) as one of
  the introductory stories to the Tam bo Cuailgne. This assumed its present
  shape substantially between 650 and 750. The introductory stories had
  originally no connection with it, and were invented or re-shaped in the 8th to
  10th centuries, after the Tam had taken undisputed place as the leading Irish
  epic. The tale may therefore be ascribed provisionally to the 9th century, if
  we can only be sure that the existing version, preserved in a single MS. of
  the 15th century, is a faithful copy of the original. There need be no doubt
  as to this. The text is due to a Christian scribe, and, like nearly alt
  portions of the mythological cycle, betrays signs of Christian influence,
  though not of Christian remodelling. Such influence is, however, far more
  likely to have exerted itself in the first stage of the written existence of
  these tales, when the memory of organised paganism was still tenacious, than
  later, when the tales had become subject-matter for the play of free poetic
  fancy. The story, printed and translated by Dr. E. Muller, <I>Rev</I>. <I>Celt.
  </I>iv. 342, &amp;c., is as follows: Angus (the chief wizard of the Tuatha de
  Danann) is visited in sleep by a maiden whose beauty throws him into love
  sick-ness. The whole of Ireland is scoured to find her the Dagda is appealed
  to in vain. At length, Bodb, fairy king of Munster, finds her at Loch bel
  Dracon (this is not the only trace of the impression which the story of Bel
  and the Dragon made upon the Irish mind). She lives there with 150 swans ; one
  year they are in swan shape the next in human shape. They appear as white
  birds with silvery chains and golden caps around their heads. Angus changes
  himself into a swan to he with her, and it is recorded of the music they made
  that &quot;people fell asleep for three days and three nights.&quot; The
  soporific power of music is that which is chiefly commended in old Irish
  literature.</P>

  <P>
I think it is obvious that the writer of
  our story was familiar with this and other legends in which swan-maids
  encircled with gold and silver chains appear, and that we may fairly draw the
  following conclusions from the preceding facts : There existed an Irish
  folk-tale of a king with two wives, one a water or sea fairy, whose children
  derive from her the capacity of shape-shifting dependent upon certain
  talismans ; jealousy impels the human wife to tamper with these talismans, and
  the children are condemned to remain in their animal form. This folk-tale was,
  probably at some time in the 14th or 15th century, arbitrarily fitted into the
  <I>cadre </I>of the Tuatha de Danann cycle, and entirely re-fashioned in a
  spirit of pious edification by a man who was in his way a great and admirable
  artist. The origin and nature of the story, all the elements of which are
  genuinely national, assured for it wide and lasting popularity. The evolution
  of the Irish folk-tale is in no way dependent upon that of the Continental
  folk-tale of the Seven Swans, but it is possible that the Celtic presentiment
  of the chain-girdled swans may have influenced it as well as the Swan Knight
  Romance.</P>

  115-65. A separate treatise on the subject has been given by S. Prato, 1882,
  La <I>Leggenda di Rhampsinite. </I>Both these writers connect the modern

Remarks</I>.-Thievery
  is universally human, and at first sight it might seem that there was no
  connection between these various versions of the &quot; Master Thief.&quot;
  But the identity of the tricks by which the popular hero-thief gains his ends
  renders it impossible that they should have been independently invented

  XXXI. THE BLACK HORSE.</P>

  </B><I>
  <P>
Sources.- </I>From<I>
  </I>J. F. Campbell's manuscript collection now deposited at the Advocates'
  Library in Edinburgh (MS. 53, vol. xi.). Collected in Gaelic, February 14,
  1862, by Hector MacLean, from Roderick MacNeill, in the island of Menglay :
  MacNeill learnt the story about 1840 from a Barra man. I have omitted one
  visit of the Black Horse to Greece, but otherwise left the tale untouched. Mr.
  Nutt gave a short abstract of the story in his report on the Campbell MSS. in <I>Folk-lore,
  </I>i. 370.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Parallels.- </I>Campbell<I>
  </I>gives the following parallels in his notes on the tale, which I quote
  verbatim. On the throwing into the well he remarks: &quot;So this incident of'
  Lady Audley's Secret' was in the mind of a Barra peasant about 1840. Part of a
  modern novel may be as old as Aryan mythology, which was one point to be
  proved.&quot; [The incident of throwing into the well almost invariably forms
  a part of the tales of the White Cat type.]</P>

  <P>
With regard to the Black Horse, Campbell
  notes that a Gaelic riddle makes a Black Horse identical with the West Wind,
  and adds &quot;It is for consideration whether this Horse throws light on the
  sacred Wheel in Indian Sculptures it is to be noted that a Black Horse is the
  sacrificial colour.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;The Cup is a well-known myth about
  winning a Fairy Cup which pervades Scandinavian England in many forms.&quot;
  &quot;A silver ring, two quaint serpents heads pointing opposite ways, is a
  common Scandinavian wedding-ring many were to be got in Barra and elsewhere in
  1869, sold by emigrants bound for America.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Those who can account for myths must
  settle the geography of the Snow Mountain. Avalanches and glaciers are In
  Iceland, in the Caucasus, and in Central Asia. There are none within sight of
  Menglay. Hindoo cosmogony, which makes the world consist of seven rings,
  separated by seas and by a wall of mountains, may account for this in some
  sort.&quot;</P>

  <P>
On the spikes driven into the Horse,
  Campbell compares the Norse story of &quot; Dapple-grim&quot; and the Horse
  sacrifice of the Mahabharata. On the building of the Magic Castle, Campbell
  remarks : &quot;Twashtri was the Carpenter of the Vedic gods : can this be his
  work?&quot;</P>

  <P>
On the Horse's head being struck off
  Campbell comments: &quot;This was the last act in the Aryan Horse's sacrifice,
  and the first step in the Horse apotheosis.&quot;</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Remarks</I>.-
  Campbell has the following note at the end of the tale, from which it would
  seem that in 1870 at least he was very nearly being an <I>Indiamaniac.</P>

  </I>
  <P>
&quot;So ends this horse-riding story.
  Taking it as it is, with the test of language added, nothing short of an Asian
  origin will account for it. A Gaelic riddle makes 'a black horse' mean the
  invisible wind, and a theorist might suppose this horse to be the air
  personified. As Greece is mentioned, he might be Pegasus, who had to do with
  wells. But he had wings, and he was white, and there is nothing in classical
  fable like this Atlantic myth. 'The enchanted horse' of Arabian Nights was a
  flying machine, and his adventures are quite different. This is not the horse
  of Chaucer's Squire's Tale. He is more like 'Hrimfaxi,' the horse of the Edda,
  who drew the car of N&#246;tt in heaven, and was ridden round the earth in twelve
  hours, followed by Dagr and his glittering horse Skinfaxi. The black horse who
  always arrives at sunrise is like the horse of night, but there is no
  equivalent story in the Edda. 'Dapple-grim' in Norse tales is clad in a spiked
  bull's hide, and is mixed up with a blazing tar-barrel, but his adventures
  won't fit, and he was grey.</P>

  <P>
&quot;The story is but an imperfect
  skeleton. The cup was to give strength; he had to open seven gates after he
  got the cup, but it does nothing. The hood is to hide with; he went in and out
  of the palace unseen after he had got the hood, but it plays no part. The
  light shoes were the shoes of swiftness of course, but they never showed their
  paces. Baldr's horse was led to the funeral pile with all his gear; and Odin
  laid the gold ring Draupnir on the pile. Such rites might account for the ring
  in the blazing lake. Hermothr's ride northwards and downwards to the abode of
  Hel to seek Baldr, his leap over the grate, and his return with the ring (Edda
  25), might account for one adventure.</P>

  <P>
&quot;The many-coloured horses of the sun
  in the Indian mythology and solar myths may account for all these horses,
  astronomically or meteorologically. The old Aryan Aswa Medha or sacrifice of a
  black horse, and the twelve adventures of Arjuna as told in the Mahabbarata,
  are something like this story in some general vague way. But the simplest
  explanation of this Menglay myth, fished out of the Atlantic, is to admit that
  'the black horse' and all this mythical breed came west with men who rode from
  the land where horses were tamed, which is unknown.&quot;</P>

XXXII. THE VISION OF MACCONGLINNEY.</P>

  </B><I>
  <P>
Source</I>.-
  Kindly condensed by Mr. Alfred Nutt from Prof. Meyer's edition of <I>The
  Vision </I>published in book form in 1892. This contains two versions, a
  longer one from a fourteenth century M S~, <I>Leabhar Breac or Speckled Book, </I>and
  a shorter one from a sixteenth century MS. in the Library of Trinity College,
  Dublin. A translation of the former version was given by the late W. M.
  Hennessy in <I>Fraser's Magazine, </I>September, 1873. Prof. Wollner, who
  contributed to Prof. Meyer's edition an introduction dealing with the story
  from the standpoint of comparative literature, considers that the later
  version reproduces the original common source more nearly.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Parallels.- </I>At<I>
  </I>first sight <I>The Vision </I>seems to picture the Land of Cockayne (on
  which see Poeschel, <I>Das M&#228;hrchen vom Schlaraffenlade,, </I>HaIle, 1878<I>),
  </I>but as Prof. Wollner remarks, the Irish form is much more simple and
  primitive, and represents rather an agricultural conception of a past <I>aurea
  aetas. </I>The conception of enormous appetite being due to the presence of a
  voracious animal or demon within the body is widespread among the folk. Prof.
  Wollner gives numerous parallels, <I>l.c. </I>XLVII.-LIII. The common
  expression 'to wolf ones food&quot; is said to be derived from this
  conception. On the personification of disease, see Tylor, <I>Primitive
  Culture, </I>ii. 148.</P>

  <P>
I can myself remember a tale somewhat
  similar to <I>The Vision </I>which I heard from my nurse in Australia, I fancy
  as a warning against gluttony. She told me of a man, who in swallowing large
  pieces of food had swallowed a little hairy monster, which grew and grew and
  grew and caused the man to be eating ah day to satisfy his visitors He was
  cured by being made to fast, and then a bowl of brandy was brought in front of
  his mouth into which the hairy thing, attracted by the fumes, jumped and 'vas
  drowned.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Remarks.- </I>W<I>e
  </I>have here an interesting example of the personification of disease in the
  form of a demon, of which some examples occur in the Gospels. The rollicking
  Rabelaisian tone in which the story is told prevents us, however, from
  attributing any serious belief in the conception by the Irish Monk the author
  of the tale, who was parodying, according to Prof. Wollner, the Visions of the
  Saints. Still he would be scarcely likely to use the conception, even for
  purposes of parody, unless it were current among the folk, and it occurs among
  them even at the present day. (See Hyde, <I>Beside the Fire, </I>p. 183.)</P>

XXXIII. DREAM OF OWEN O'MULREADY.</P>

  p.57 <I>seq</I>.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Parallel</I>.-
  Croker's <I>Daniel O'Rourke </I>may be compared in part.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Remarks. - </I>At<I>
  </I>first sight a mere droll, the story has its roots In the most primitive
  philosophy. Owen's problem is to get in the Land of Dreams. Now Dreamland, so
  all our students of Mythology are agreed, is the source and origin of our
  belief in souls and spirits. Owen's problem therefore resolves itself into
  this: where was he to go in order to come into closest contact with the world
  of spirits. Mark what he does - he clears the hearth and has his bed made in
  it. Now it is round the hearth that the fullest associations with the spirit
  life are clustered. The late M. Fustel de Coulanges in his <I>Cit&#233; Antique </I>traces
  back most of the Greek and Roman religions and a large number of their
  institutions to the worship of the ancestors localised on the hearth. The late
  Professor Hearn extended his line of research to the whole of the Aryans in
  his <I>Aryan Household. </I>It will thus be seen from this course of
  reasoning, that Owen was acting on the most approved primitive principles in
  adopting this curious method of obtaining dreams. The story is not known
  elsewhere than in Ireland, and we are therefore at liberty to apply the method
  of Survivals to this case.</P>

  The story itself was from Terence Davis of Rendyle, Co. Galway. There is

  wife.</P>

  <P>
Parallels.- </I>Carnpbell's<I>
  </I>No. I has a very close parallel to the opening. Mr. Larminie refers to a
  similar tale collected by Kennedy. Another version from West Munster has been
  recently published in the <I>Gaelic Iournal </I>iv. 7, 26, 35. The evasion of
  the promise to give up the sword at the end seems a favourite incident in
  Achill folk-tales ; it occurs in two others of Mr. Larminie's stories. On the
  framework, see note on &quot;Conal Yellow claw&quot; <I>(Celtic Folktales, </I>v.).
  I have there suggested that the plan comes from the East, ultimately from
  Buddha.</P>

  </I>have made up this Celtic Reynard out of several fables given by Campbell, <I>West
  Highland Tales, </I>under the title &quot;Fables,&quot; vol. i. pp.275 <I>seq.;
  </I>and &quot;The Keg of Butter&quot; and the &quot;The Fox and the little
  Bonnach,&quot; vol. iii. Nos. lxv. lxvi.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Parallels.- </I>The<I>
  </I>Fox's ruse about a truce among the animals is a well-known Aesop's Fable
  see my edition of <I>Carton's Aesop, </I>vol. ii. p.307, and <I>Parallels, </I>vol.
  i. p.267. The trick by which the cock gets out of the fox's mouth is a part of
  the Reynard Cycle, and is given by Chaucer as his &quot;Nonne Preste's
  Tale.&quot; How the wolf lost his tail is also part of the same cycle, the
  parallels of which are given by K. Krohn, <I>B&#228;r (Wolf) und Fuchs </I>(Helsingfors,
  1889), pp.26-8. The same writer has studied the geographical distribution of
  the story in Finland, accompanied by a map, in <I>Fennia, </I>iv. No.4. I have
  given a mediaeval Hebrew version in my <I>Jews</I> <I>of Angevin England, </I>pp.
  170-2. See also Gerber, <I>Great Russian Animal Tales, </I>pp. 48-50. The wolf
  was originally the bear, as we see from the conclusion of the incident, which
  professes to explain why the wolf is stumpy-tailed. &quot;The Keg of Butter
  &quot; combines two of the Grimm stories, 2, 189. &quot;The Little
  Bonnach&quot; occurs also in English and has been given in two variants in <I>English
  Fairy Tales, </I>No. xxviii. and <I>More English Fairy Tales, </I>No. lvii.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Remarks.- </I>It
  would lead me too far afield to discuss here the sources of Reynard the Fox,
  with which I hope shortly to deal at length elsewhere. But I would remark that
  in this case, as in several others we have observed, the stories, which are
  certainly reproductions, have received the characteristic Celtic dress. It
  follows that we cannot conclude anything as to the origin of a tale from the
  fact that it is told idiomatically. On the other hand, the stories of&quot;
  The Fox and Wrens &quot;and &quot; The Fox and the Todhunter,' and ' How the
  Fox gets rid of his Fleas,&quot; have no parallels elsewhere, and show the
  possibility of a native beast tale or cycle of tales.</P>

Parallels</I>. -
  Parnell's poem, <I>Edwin and Sir Topaz, </I>contains the same story. As he was
  born in Dublin, 1679, this traces the tale back at least 200 years in Ireland.
  Practically the same story, however, has been found in Japan, and translated
  into English under the title, &quot;Kobutori ; or, The Old Man and the
  Devils.&quot; In the story published by Kobunsha, Tokio, the Old Man has a
  lump on the side of his face. He sees the demons dancing, and getting
  exhilarated, joins in. Thereupon the devils are so delighted that they wish to
  see him again, and as a pledge of his return take away from him his lump.
  Another old man, who has a similar lump on the other side of his face, hearing
  of this, tries the same plan, but dances so badly that the devils, not wishing
  to see him again, and mistaking him for the other old man, give him back the
  lump, so that he has one on each side of his face.</P>

  <P>
I may add here that Mr. York Powell informs
  me that No. xvii. of the same series, entitled, &quot; Shippietaro,&quot;
  contains a parallel to the &quot;Hobyahs&quot; of <I>More
  English Tales.</P>

  <P>
Remarks.- </I>Here<I>
  </I>we have a problem of diffusion presented in its widest form. There can be
  little doubt that &quot;The Legend of Knockgrafton &quot; and &quot;
  Kobutori,&quot; one collected in Ireland and to be traced there for the last
  200 years, and the other collected at the present day in Japan, are one and
  the same story, and it is impossible to imagine they were independently
  produced. Considering that Parnell could not have come across the Japanese
  version, we must conclude that &quot;Kobutori &quot;is a recent importation
  into Japan. On the other hand, as &quot;the Hobyahs&quot; cannot be traced in
  England, and was collected from a Scottish family settled in the United
  States, where Japanese influence has been considerable, it is possible that
  this tale was derived from Japan within the memory of men still living. It
  would be highly desirable to test these two cases, in which we seem to be able
  to observe the process of the diffusion of Folk Tales going on before our
  eyes.</P>

  Rev., </I>iii. 39 <I>seq. </I>Davies, <I>Mythology of the British Druids, </I>p.155,
  tells a story of a door in a rock near a cave in the mountains of Brecknock,
  which was left open for Mayday, and men used to enter, and so reach that fairy
  island in the middle of the lake. The visitors were treated very hospitably by
  their fairy hosts, but on the condition that they might eat all, but pocket
  none; for once, a visitor took away with him a fairy flower, and as soon as he
  got outside the door the flower vanished, and the door was never more opened.
  &quot;The Luck of Edenhall,&quot; still in existence, is supposed to be a
  trophy brought back from a similar visit.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Remarks.- </I>Mr<I>.
  </I>Hartland suggests that these legends, and the relics connected with them,
  are in some way connected with the heathen rites prevalent in these islands
  before the introduction of Christianity, which may have lingered on into
  historic times. The absence of sunlight in this account of the House of the
  Fairies, as in &quot;Childe Rowland &quot; (on which see note in <I>English
  Fairy Tales), </I>may be regarded as a point in favour of Mr. MacRitchie's
  theories as to the identification of the fairies with the mound-dwellers. The
  object of the expectoration was to prevent Elidore's seeing his way back. Thus
  the fairies prevent the indiscretions of the human midwives they employ.</P>

  version.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Parallels.- </I>The<I>
  </I>earliest version, from an Egerton MS. of the fifteenth century, has been
  printed by Mr. S. H. O'Grady in his <I>Silva Gadelica, </I>No.20, with an
  English version, pp.332-42. Mr. Campbell of Tiree has given a short Gaelic
  version in the <I>Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, </I>78-100.
  Campbell of Islay collected the fullest version of this celebrated story,
  which is to be found among his manuscript remains now in Edinburgh. Mr. Nutt
  has given his English abstract in <I>Folk-lore, </I>i. 373-7, in its original
  form. The story must have contained twenty-four tales or episodes of stories,
  nineteen of which are preserved in J. F. Campbell's version. For parallels to
  the various incidents, see Mr. Nutt's notes on Maclnnes, pp. 47~3. The tale is
  referred to in MacNicol, <I>Remarks on Dr. Johnson's Journey to the Hebrides, </I>1779.</P>

  <I>
  <P>
Remarks</I>.-
  Nothing could give a more vivid idea of what might be called the organisation
  of the art of story-telling among the Celts than this elaborate tale. Mr. Nutt
  is inclined to trace it, even in its present form, back to the twelfth or,
  thirteenth century. It occurs in an MS. of the fifteenth century in an
  obviously unoriginal form which shows that the story-teller did not appreciate
  the significance of many features in the folk-tale he was retelling, and yet
  it was orally collected by the great Campbell in 1871, in a version which runs
  to 142 folio pages.</P>

  <P>
Formally, its interest consists in large
  measure in the curious frame-work in which the subsidiary stories are
  imbedded. This is not of the elaborate kind introduced into Europe from the
  East by the Crusades, but more <I>naive, </I>resembling rather, as Mr. Nutt
  points out to me, the loosely-knit narratives of Charles Lever in his earlier
  manner.</P>

  Strays, </I>iii. pp. 76 <I>seq.</P>

  <P>
Remarks.- </I>There<I>
  </I>can be no doubt that the Celtic and German Riddle Stories are related
  genealogically. Which is of the earlier generation is, however, more difficult
  to determine. In favour of the Celtic is the polygamous framework; while on
  the other hand, it is difficult to guess how the story could have got from the
  Highlands to Germany. The simpler form of the riddle in the German version
  might seem to argue greater antiquity.</P>
