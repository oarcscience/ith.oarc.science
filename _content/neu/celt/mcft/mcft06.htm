<CENTER><H1>The Vision of MacConglinney</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
CATHAL,
  King of Munster, was a good king and a great warrior. But there came to dwell
  within him a lawless evil beast, that afflicted him with hunger that ceased
  not, and might not be satisfied, so that he would devour a pig, a cow, and a
  bull calf and three-score cakes of pure wheat, and a vat of new ale, for his
  breakfast, whilst as for his great feast, what he ate there passes account or
  reckoning. He was like this for three half-years, and during that time it was
  the ruin of Munster he was, and it is likely he would have ruined all Ireland
  in another half-year.</P>

  
  <P>
Now there lived in Armagh a famous young scholar and his name
  was Anier MacConglinney. He heard of the strange disease of King Cathal, and
  of the abundance of food and drink, of whitemeats, ale and mead, there were
  always to be found at the king's court. Thither then was he minded to go to
  try his own fortune, and to see of what help he could be to the king.</P>

  <P>
He arose early in the morning and tucked up his shirt and
  wrapped him in the folds of his white cloak. In his right hand he grasped his
  even-poised knotty staff, and going right-hand-wise round his home, he bade
  farewell to his tutors and started off.</P>

  <P>
He journeyed across all Ireland till he came to the house of
  Pichan. And there he stayed and told tales, and made all merry. But Pichan
  said:</P>

  <P>
&quot;Though great thy mirth, son of learning, it does not
  make me glad.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;And why ?&quot; asked MacConglinney.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Knowest thou not, scholar, that Cathal is coming here
  to-night with all his host. And if the great host is trouble-some, the king's
  first meal is more troublesome still ; and troublesome though the first be,
  most troublesome of all is the great feast. Three things are wanted for this
  last: a bushel of oats, and a bushel of wild apples, and a bushel of flour
  cakes.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;What reward would you give me if I shield you from the
  king from this hour to the same hour to-tnorrow ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;A white sheep from every fold between Cam and
  Cork.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will take that,&quot; said MacConglinney.</P>

  <P>
Cathal, the king, came with the companies, and a host of horse
  of the Munster men. But Cathal did not let the thong of his shoe be half
  loosed before he began supplying his mouth with both hands from the apples
  round about him. Pichan and all the men of Munster looked on sadly and
  sorrowfully. Then rose Macconglinney, hastily and impatiently, and seized a
  stone, against which swords were used to be sharpened ; this he thrust into
  his mouth and began grinding his teeth against the stone.</P>

  <P>
&quot;What makes thee mad, son of learning?&quot; asked
  Cathal.</P>

  <P>
&quot;I grieve to see you eating alone,&quot; said the
  scholar.</P>

  <P>
Then the king was ashamed and flung him the apples, and it is
  said that for three half-years he had not performed such an act of humanity.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Grant me a further boon,&quot; said MacConglinney.</P>

  <P>
&quot;It is granted, on my troth,&quot; said the king.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Fast with me the whole night,&quot; said the scholar.</P>

  <P>
And grievous though it was to the king, he did so, for he had
  passed his princely troth, and no King of Munster might transgress that.</P>

  <P>
In the morning MacConglinney called for juicy old bacon, and
  tender corned beef, honey in the comb, and English salt on a beautiful
  polished dish of white silver. A fire he lighted of oak wood without smoke,
  without fumes, without sparks.</P>

  <P>
And sticking spits into the portion of meat, he set to work to
  roast them. Then he shouted, &quot;Ropes and cords here.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Ropes and cords were given to him, and the strongest of the
  warriors.</P>

  <P>
And they seized the king and bound him securely, and made him
  fast with knots and hooks and staples. When the king was thus fastened,
  MacConglinney sat himself down before him, and taking his knife out of his
  girdle, he carved the portion of meat that was on the spits, and every morsel
  he dipped in the honey, and, passing it in front of the king's mouth, put it
  in his own.</P>

  <P>
When the king saw that he was getting nothing, and he had been
  fasting for twenty-four hours, he roared and bellowed, and commanded the
  killing of the scholar. But that was not done for him.</P>

  <P>
Listen, King of Munster,&quot; said MacConglinney, &quot;a
  vision appeared to me last night, and I will relate it to you.&quot;</P>

  <P>
He then began his vision, and as he related it he put morsel
  after morsel past Cathal's mouth into his own.</P>

  <P>
&quot;A lake of new milk I beheld<BR>

  In the midst of a<I> </I>fair plain,<BR>

  Therein a well-appointed house,<BR>

  Thatched with butter.<BR>

  Puddings fresh boiled,<BR>

  Such were its thatch-rods,<BR>

  Its two soft door posts of custard,<BR>

  Its beds of glorious bacon.<BR>

  Cheeses were the palisades,<BR>

  Sausages the rafters.<BR>

  Truly 'twas a rich filled house,<BR>

  In which was great store of good feed.</P>

  <P>
Such was the vision I beheld, and a voice sounded into my
  ears. 'Go now, thither, MacConglinney, for you have no power of eating in
  you.' ' What must I do,' said I, for the sight of that had made me greedy.
  Then the voice bade me go to the hermitage of the Wizard Doctor, and there I
  should find appetite for all kinds of savoury tender sweet food, acceptable to
  the body.</P>

  <P>
&quot;There in the harbour of the lake before me I saw a juicy
  little coracle of beef; its thwarts were of curds, its prow of lard ; its
  stern of butter ; its oars were flitches of venison. Then I rowed across the
  wide expanse of the New Milk Lake, through seas of broth, past river mouths of
  meat, over swelling boisterous waves of butter milk, by perpetual pools of
  savoury lard, by islands of cheese, by headlands of old curds, until I reached
  the firm level land between Butter Mount and Milk Lake, in the land of
  O'Early-eating, in front of the hermitage of the Wizard Doctor.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Marvellous, indeed, was the hermitage. Around it were
  seven-score hundred smooth stakes of old bacon, and instead of thorns above
  the top of every stake was fixed juicy lard. There was a gate of cream,
  whereon was a bolt of sausage. And there I saw the doorkeeper, Bacon Lad, son
  of Butterkins, son of Lardipole, with his smooth sandals of old bacon, his
  legging of pot-meat round his shins, his tunic of corned beef, his girdle of
  salmon skin round him, his hood of flummery about him, his steed of bacon
  under him, with its four legs of custard, its four hoofs of oaten bread, its
  ears of curds, its two eyes of honey in its head ; in his hand a whip, the
  cords whereof were four-and-twenty fair white puddings, and every juicy drop
  that fell from each of these puddings would have made a meal for an ordinary
  man.</P>

  <P>
&quot;On going in I beheld the Wizard Doctor with his two
  gloves of rump steak on his hands, setting in order the house, which was hung
  all round with tripe, from roof to floor.</P>

  <P>
&quot;I went into the kitchen, and there I saw the Wizard
  Doctor's son, with his fishing hook of lard in his hand, and the line was made
  of marrow, and he was angling in a lake of whey. Now he would bring up a
  flitch of ham, and now a fillet of corned beef. And as he was angling, he fell
  in, and was drowned.</P>

  <P>
&quot;As I set my foot across the threshold into the house, I
  saw a pure white bed of butter, on which I sat down, but I sank down into it
  up to the tips of my hair. Hard work had the eight strongest men in the house
  to pull me out by the top of the crown of my head.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Then I was taken in to the Wizard Doctor. 'What aileth
  thee ?' said he.</P>

  <P>
&quot;My wish would be, that all the many wonderful viands of
  the world were before me, that I might eat my fill and satisfy my greed. But
  alas ! great is the misfortune to me, who cannot obtain any of these.</P>

  <P>
&quot;'On my word,' said the Doctor, 'the disease is grievous.
  But thou shall take home with thee a medicine to cure thy disease, and shalt
  be for ever healed therefrom.'</P>

  <P>
&quot; 'What is that ?' asked I.</P>

  <P>
When thou goest home to-night, warm thyself before a glowing
  red fire of oak, made up on a dry hearth, so that its embers may warm thee,
  its blaze may not burn thee, its smoke may not touch thee. And make for
  thyself thrice nine morsels, and every morsel as big as an heath fowl's egg,
  and in each morsel eight kinds of grain, wheat and barley, oats and rye, and
  therewith eight condiments, and to every condiment eight sauces. And when thou
  hast prepared thy food, take a drop of drink, a tiny drop, only as much as
  twenty men will drink, and let it be of thick milk, of yellow bubbling milk,
  of milk that will gurgle as it rushes down thy throat.'</P>

  <P>
&quot; 'And when thou hast done this, whatever disease thou
  hast, shall be removed. Go now,' said he, 'in the name of cheese, and may the
  smooth juicy bacon protect thee, may yellow curdy cream protect, may the
  cauldron full of pottage protect thee.' &quot;</P>

  <P>
Now, as MacConglinney recited his vision, what with the
  pleasure of the recital and the recounting of these many pleasant viands, and
  the sweet savour of the honeyed morsels roasting on the spits, the lawless
  beast that dwelt within the king, came forth until it was licking its lips
  outside its head.</P>

  <P ALIGN="center">
</P>

  <P>
Then MacConglinney bent his hand with the two spits of food,
  and put them to the lips of the king, who longed to swallow them, wood, food,
  and all. So he took them an arm's length away from the king, and the lawless
  beast jumped from the throat of Cathal on to the spit. MacConglinney put the
  spit into the embers, and upset the cauldron of the royal house over the spit.
  The house was emptied, so that not the value of a cockchafer's leg was left in
  it, and four huge fires were kindled here and there in it. When the house was
  a tower of red flame and a huge blaze, the lawless beast sprang to the
  rooftree of the palace, and from thence he vanished, and was seen no more.</P>

  <P>
As for the king, a bed was prepared for him on a downy quilt,
  and musicians and singers entertained him going from noon till twilight. And
  when he awoke, this is what he bestowed upon the scholar - a cow from every
  farm, and a sheep from every house in Munster. Moreover, that so long as he
  lived, he should carve the king's food, and sit at his right hand.</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <P>
Thus was Cathal, King of Munster, cured of his craving, and
  MacConglinney honoured.</P>
