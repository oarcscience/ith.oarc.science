<CENTER><H1>How Cormac Mac Art went to Faery</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
CORMAC, son of Art, son of Conn of the Hundred Battles, was
  high King of Ireland, and held his Court at Tara. One day he saw a youth upon
  the green having in his hand a glittering fairy branch with nine apples of
  red. And whensoever the branch was shaken, wounded men and women enfeebled by
  illness would be lulled to sleep by the sound of the very sweet fairy music
  which those apples uttered, nor could any one upon earth bear in mind any
  want, woe, or weariness of soul when that branch was shaken for him.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Is that branch thy own ?&quot; said Cormac. It is indeed
  mine.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Wouldst thou sell it? and what wouldst thou require for
  it ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Will you give me what I ask ? &quot; said the youth.</P>


<P>
The king promised, and the youth then claimed
his wife, his daughter, and his son. Sorrowful of heart was the king, heaviness
of heart filled his wife and children when they learned that they must part from
him. But Cormac shook the branch amongst them, and when they heard the soft
sweet music of the branch they forgot all care and sorrow and went forth to meet
the youth, and he and they took their departure and were seen no more. Loud
cries of weeping and mourning were made throughout Erin when this was known but
Cormac shook the branch so that there was no longer any grief or heaviness of
heart upon any one.</P>


<P>
After a year Cormac said &quot; It is a year tu day since my
wife, my son, and my daughter were taken from me. I will follow them by the same
path that they took.&quot;</P>

<P>
Cormac went off, and a dark magical mist rose about him, and he
chanced to come upon a wonderful marvellous plain. Many horsemen were there,
busy thatching a house with the feathers of foreign birds ; when one side was
thatched they would go and seek more, and when they returned not a feather was
on the roof. Cormac gazed at them for a while and then went forward.</P>

<P>
Again, he saw a youth dragging up trees to make a fire but
before he could find a second tree the first one would be burnt, and it seemed
to Cormac that his labour would never end.</P>

<P>
Cormac journeyed onwards until he saw three immense wells on the
border of the plain, and on each well was a head. From out the mouth of the
first head there flowed two streams, into it there flowed one; the second head
had a stream flowing out of and another stream into its mouth, whilst three
streams were flowing from the mouth of the third head. Great wonder seized
Cormac, and he said &quot;I will stay and gaze upon these wells, for I should
find no man to tell me your story.&quot; With that he set onwards till he came
to a house in the middle of a field. He entered and greeted the inmates. There
sat within a tall couple clad in many-hued garments, and they greeted the king,
and bade him welcome for the night.</P>

<P>
Then the wife bade her husband seek food, and he arose and
returned with a huge wild boar upon his hack and a log in his hand. He cast down
the swine and the log upon the floor, and said &quot;There is meat ; cook it for
yourselves.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;How can I do that? &quot; said Cormac.</P>

<P>
&quot;I will teach you,&quot; said the youth. &quot;Split this
great log, make four pieces of it, and make four quarters of the hog; put a log
under each quarter; tell a true story. and the meat will be cooked.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Tell the first story yourself&quot; said Cormac.</P>

<P>
&quot;Seven pigs I have of the same kind as the one I brought,
and I could feed the world with them. For if a pig is killed I have but to put
its bones into the stye again, and it will be found alive the next
morning.&quot;</P>

<P>
The story was true, and a quarter of the pig was cooked.</P>

<P>
Then Cormac begged the woman of the house to tell a story.</P>

<P>
&quot;I have seven white cows, and they fill seven cauldrons
with milk every day, and I give my word that they yield as much milk as would
satisfy the men of the whole world if they were out on yonder plain drinking
it.&quot;</P>

<P>
That story was true, and a second quarter of the pig was cooked.</P>

<P>
Cormac was bidden now to tell a story for his quarter, and he
told how he was upon a search for his wife, his son and his daughter that had
been borne away from him a year before by a youth with a fairy branch.</P>

<P>
&quot;If what thou sayest be true,&quot; said the man of the
house, &quot;thou art indeed Cormac, son of Art, son of Conn of the Hundred
Battles.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Truly I am,&quot; quoth Cormac.</P>

<P>
That story was true, and a quarter of the pig was cooked.</P>

<P>
&quot;Eat thy meal now,&quot; said the man of the house.</P>

<P>
&quot;I never ate before,&quot; said Cormac, &quot;having only
two people in my company.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Wouldst thou eat it with three others ?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;If they were dear to me, I would,&quot; said Cormac.</P>

<P>
Then the door opened, and there entered the wife and children of
Cormac : great was his joy and his exultation.</P>

<P>
Then Manannan mac Lir, lord of the fairy Cavalcade, appeared
before him in his own true form, and said thus :</P>

<P>
&quot;I it was, Cormac; who bore away these three from thee. I
it was who gave thee this branch, all that I might bring thee here. Eat now and
drink.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;I would do so,&quot; said Cormac, &quot;could I learn the
meaning of the wonders I saw to-day.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Thou shalt learn them,&quot; said Manannan. &quot;The
horsemen thatching the roof with feathers are a likeness of people who go forth
into the world to seek riches and fortune when they return their houses are
bare, and so they go on for ever. The young man dragging up the trees to make a
fire is a likeness of those who labour for others much trouble they have, but
they never warm themselves at the fire. The three heads in the wells are three
kinds of men. Some there are who give freely when they get freely; some who give
freely though they get little; some who get much and give little, and they are
the worst of the three, Cormac,&quot; said Manannan.</P>

<P>
After that Cormac and his wife and his children sat down, and a
table-cloth was spread before them.</P>

<P>
&quot;That is a very precious thing before thee,&quot; said
Manannan, &quot;there is no food however delicate that shall be asked of it but
it shall be had without doubt.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;That is well,&quot; quoth Cormac.</P>

<P>
After that Manannan thrust his hand into his girdle and brought
out a goblet and set it upon his palm. &quot;This cup has this virtue, said he,
&quot;that when a false story is told before it, it makes four pieces of it, and
when a true story is related it is made whole again.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Those are very precious things you have, Manannan,&quot;
said the king.</P>

<P>
&quot;They shall all be thine,&quot; said Manannan, &quot;the
goblet, the branch and the tablecloth.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then they ate their meal, and that meal was good, for they could
not think of any meat but they got it upon the tablecloth, nor of any drink but
they got it in the cup. Great thanks did they give to Manannan.</P>

<P>
When they had eaten their meal a couch was prepared for them and
they laid down to slumber and sweet sleep.</P>

<P>
Where they rose on the morrow morn was in Tara of the kings, and
by their side were tablecloth, cup, and branch.</P>

<P>
Thus did Cormac fare at the Court of Manannan, and this is how
he got the fairy branch.</P>
