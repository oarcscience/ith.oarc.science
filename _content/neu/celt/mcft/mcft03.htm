<CENTER><H1>Powel, Prince of Dyfed</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
POWEL, Prince of Dyfed, was lord of the seven Cantrevs of
  Dyfed; and once upon a time Powel was at Narberth, his chief palace, where a
  feast had been prepared for him, and with him was a great host of men. And
  after the first meal, Powel arose to walk, and he went to the top of a mound
  that was above the palace, and was called Gorseth Arberth.</P>

  <P>
&quot; Lord,&quot; said one of the court, &quot;it is peculiar
  to the mound that whosoever sits upon it cannot go thence without either
  receiving wounds or blows, or else seeing a wonder.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I fear not to receive wounds and blows in the midst of
  such a host as this; but as to the wonder, gladly would I see it. I will go,
  therefore, and sit upon the mound.&quot;</P>

  <P>
And upon the mound he sat. And while he sat there, they saw a
  lady, on a pure white horse of large size, with a garment of shining gold
  around her, coming along the highway that led from the mound; and the horse
  seemed to move at a slow and even pace, and to be coming up towards the mound.</P>

  <P>
&quot;My men,&quot; said Powel, &quot; is there any among you
  who knows yonder lady?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;There is not, lord,&quot; said they.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Go one of you and meet her, that we may know who she
  is.&quot;</P>

  <P>
And one of them arose ; and as he came upon the road to meet
  her she passed by, and he followed as fast as he could, being on foot; and the
  greater was his speed, the farther was she from him. And when he saw that it
  profited him nothing to follow her, he returned to Pwyll, and said unto him,
  &quot;Lord, it is idle for any one in the world to follow her on foot.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Verily,&quot; said Powel, &quot;go unto the palace, and
  take the fleetest horse that thou seest, and go after her.&quot;</P>

  <P>
And he took a horse and went forward. And he came to an open
  level plain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more he urged his horse, the
  farther was she from him. Yet she held the same pace as at first. And his
  horse began to fail; and when his horse's feet failed him, he ye-turned to the
  place where Powel was.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord,&quot; said he, &quot; it will avail nothing for
  any one to follow yonder lady. I know of no horse in these realms swifter than
  this, and it availed me not to pursue her.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Of a truth,&quot; said Powel, &quot;there must be some
  illusion here. Let us go towards the palace.&quot; So to the palace they went,
  and they spent that day. And the next day they arose, and that also they spent
  until it was time to go to meat. And after the first meal, &quot;Verily,&quot;
  said Powel, &quot;we will go, the same party as yesterday, to the top of the
  mound. Do thou,&quot; said he to one of his young men, &quot;take the swiftest
  horse that thou knowest in the field. And thus did the young man. They went
  towards the mound, taking the horse with them. And as they were sitting down
  they beheld the lady on the same horse, and in the same apparel, coming along
  the same road. &quot;Behold,&quot; said Powel, &quot;here is the lady of
  yesterday. Make ready, youth, to learn who she is.&quot;</P>

  <P>
My lord,&quot; said he &quot;that will I gladly do.&quot; And
  thereupon the lady came opposite to them. So the youth mounted his horse ; and
  before he had settled himself in his saddle, she passed by, and there was a
  clear space between them. But her speed was no greater than it had been the
  day before. Then he put his horse into an amble, and thought, that,
  notwithstanding the gentle pace at which his horse went, he should soon
  overtake her. But this availed him not: so he gave his horse the reins. And
  still he came no nearer to her than when he went at a foot's pace. The more he
  urged his horse, the farther was she from him. Yet she rode not faster than
  before. When he saw that it availed not to follow her, he returned to the
  place where Powel was. &quot; Lord,&quot; said he, &quot;the horse can no more
  than thou hast seen.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I see indeed that it avails not that any one should
  follow her. And by Heaven,&quot; said he, &quot;she must needs have an errand
  to some one in this plain, if her haste would allow her to declare it. Let us
  go back to the palace.&quot; And to the palace they went, and they spent that
  night in songs and feasting, as it pleased them.</P>

  <P>
The next day they amused themselves until it was time to go to
  meat. And when meat was ended, Powel said, &quot;Where are the hosts that went
  yesterday and the day before to the top of the mound ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Behold, lord, we are here,&quot; said they.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Let us go,&quot; said he, &quot;to the mound to sit
  there. And do thou,&quot; said he to the page who tended his horse,
  &quot;saddle my horse well, and hasten with him to the road, and bring also my
  spurs with thee.&quot; And the youth did thus, They went and Sat upon the
  mound. And ere they had been there but a short time, they beheld the lady
  coming by the same road, and in the same manner, and at the same pace.
  &quot;Young man, said Powel, &quot;I see the lady coming give me my
  horse.&quot; And no sooner had he mounted his horse than she passed him. And
  he turned after her, and followed her. And he let his horse go bounding
  playfully, and thought that at the second step or the third he should come up
  with her. But he came no nearer to her than at first. Then he urged his horse
  to his utmost speed, yet he found that it availed nothing to follow her. Then
  said Powel, &quot;O maiden, &quot; for the sake of him who thou best lovest,
  stay for me.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will stay gladly,&quot; said she, &quot;and it were
  better for thy horse hadst thou asked it long since.&quot; So the maiden
  stopped, and she threw back that part of her head-dress which covered her
  face. And she fixed her eyes upon him, and began to talk with him,</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lady,&quot; asked he, &quot;whence comest thou, and
  whereunto dost thou journey ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I journey on mine own errand,&quot; said she, &quot;and
  right glad am I to see thee.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;My greeting be unto thee,&quot; said he. Then he thought
  that the beauty of all the maidens, and all the ladies that he had ever seen,
  was as nothing compared to her beauty.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lady,&quot; he said, &quot;wilt thou tell me aught
  concerning thy purpose?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will tell thee,&quot; said she. &quot; My chief quest
  was to seek thee.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Behold,&quot; said Powel, &quot;this is to me the most
  pleasing quest on which thou couldst have come. And wilt thou tell me who thou
  art ?&quot;</P>

  <P ALIGN="center">
</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will tell thee, lord,&quot; said she. &quot;I am
  Rhiannon, the daughter of Heveyth H&#234;n, and they sought to give me to a
  husband against my will. But no husband would I have, and that because of my
  love for thee, neither will I yet have one unless thou reject me. And hither
  have I come to hear thy answer.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;By Heaven,&quot; said Powel, &quot;behold this is my
  answer. If I might choose among all the ladies and damsels in the world, thee
  would I choose.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Verily,&quot; said she, &quot;if thou art thus minded,
  make a pledge to meet me ere I am given to another.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;The sooner I may do so, the more pleasing will it be
  unto me,&quot; said Powel, &quot;and wheresoever thou wilt, there will I meet
  with thee.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will that thou meet me this day twelvemonth, at the
  palace of Heveyth. And I will cause a feast to be prepared, so that it be
  ready against thou come.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Gladly,&quot; said he, &quot; will I keep this
  tryst.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord,&quot; said she, &quot;remain in health, and be
  mindful that thou keep thy promise And now I will go hence.&quot;</P>

  <P>
So they parted, and he went back to his hosts and to them of
  his household. And whatsoever questions they asked him respecting the damsel,
  he always turned the discourse upon other matters. And when a year from that
  time was gone, he caused a hundred knights to equip themselves, and to go with
  him to the palace of Heveyth H&#234;n. And he came to the palace, and there was
  great joy concerning him, with much concourse of people, and great rejoicing,
  and vast preparations for his coming. And the whole court was placed under his
  orders.</P>

  <P>
And the hall was garnished, and they went to meat, and thus
  did they sit; Heveyth H&#234;n was on one side of Powel, and Rhiannon on the
  other. And all the rest according to their rank. And they ate and feasted and
  talked, one with another; and at the beginning of the carousal after the meat,
  there entered a tall auburn-haired youth, of royal bearing, clothed in a
  garment of satin. And when he came into the hall he saluted Powel and his
  companions.</P>

  <P>
&quot;The greeting of Heaven be unto thee, my soul,&quot; said
  Powel. &quot;Come thou and sit down.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Nay,&quot; said he, &quot;a suitor am I; and I will do
  mine errand.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Do so willingly,&quot; said Powel.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord,&quot; said he, &quot;my errand is unto thee ; and
  it is to crave a boon of thee that I come.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;What boon soever thou mayest ask of me, as far as I am
  able, thou shalt have.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ah,&quot; said Rhiannon, &quot;wherefore didst thou give
  that answer ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Has he not given it before the presence of these
  nobles?&quot; asked the youth.</P>

  <P>
&quot;My soul,&quot; said Powel, &quot;what is the boon thou
  askest?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;The lady whom best I love is to be thy bride this night
  I come to ask her of thee, with the feast and the banquet that are in this
  place.&quot;</P>

  <P>
And Powel was silent because of the answer which he had given.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Be silent as long as thou wilt,&quot; said Rhiannon.
  &quot;Never did man make worse use of his wits than thou hast done.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lady,&quot; said he, &quot;I knew not who he was.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Behold, this is the man to whom they would have given me
  against my will,&quot; said she.</P>

  <P>
&quot;And he is Gwawl the son of Clud, a man of great power
  and wealth; and because of the word thou hast spoken, bestow me upon him, lest
  shame befall thee.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lady,&quot; said he, &quot;I understand not thine
  answer. Never can I do as thou sayest.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Bestow me upon him,&quot; said she, &quot;and I will
  cause that I shall never be his.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;By what means will that be?&quot; said Powel.</P>

  <P>
&quot;In thy hand will I give thee a small bag,&quot; said
  she. See that thou keep it well, and he will ask of thee the banquet and the
  feast, and the preparations, which are not in thy power. Unto the hosts and
  the household will I give the feast. And such will be thy answer respecting
  this. And as concerns myself, I will engage to become his bride this night
  twelvemonth. And at the end of the year be thou here,&quot; said she,
  &quot;and bring this hag with thee and let thy hundred knights be in the
  orchard up yonder. And when he is in the midst of joy and feasting, come thou
  in by thyself, clad in ragged garments, and holding thy bag in thy hand, and
  ask nothing but a bagful of food and I will cause that if all the meat and
  liquor that are in these seven cantrevs were put into it, it would be no
  fuller than before. And after a great deal has been put therein, he will ask
  thee whether thy bag will ever be full. Say thou then that it never will,
  until a man of noble birth and of great wealth arise and press the food in the
  bag with both his feet, saying, 'Enough has been put therein.' And I will
  cause him to go and tread down the food in the bag, and when he does so, turn
  thou the bag, so that he shall be up over his head in it' and then slip a knot
  upon the thongs of the bag. Let there be also a good bugle-horn about thy
  neck, and as soon as thou hast bound him in the bag, wind thy horn, and let it
  be a signal between thee and thy knights. And when they hear the sound of the
  horn,. let them come down upon the palace.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord,&quot; said Gwawl, &quot;it is meet that I have an
  answer to my request.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;As much of that thou hast asked as it is in my power to
  give, thou shalt have,&quot; replied Powel.</P>

  <P>
&quot;My soul,&quot; said Rhiannon unto him, &quot;as for the
  feast and the banquet that are here, I have bestowed them upon the men of
  Dyved, and the household, and the warriors that are with us. These can I not
  suffer to be given to any. In a year from to-night a banquet shall be prepared
  for thee in this palace, that I may become thy bride.&quot;</P>

  <P>
So Gwawl went forth to his possessions, and Powel went also
  back to Dyved. And they both spent that year until it was the time for the
  feast at the palace of Heveyth H&#234;n. Then Gwawl the son of Clud set out to the
  feast that was prepared for him, and he came to the palace and was received
  there with rejoicing. Powel also, the chief of Annuvyn, came to the orchard
  with his hundred knights, as Rhiannon had commanded him, having the bag with
  him. And Powel was clad in coarse and ragged garments, and wore large clumsy
  old shoes upon his feet. And when he knew that the carousal after the meat had
  begun, he went towards the hall, and when he came into the hall, he saluted
  Gwawl the son of Clud, and his company, both men and women.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Heaven prosper thee &quot; said Gwawl, &quot;and the
  greeting of Heaven be unto thee!&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord,&quot; said he, &quot;may Heaven reward thee
  !&quot; I have an errand unto thee.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Welcome be thine errand, and, if thou ask of me that
  which is just, thou shalt have it gladly.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;It is fitting,&quot; answered he. &quot;I crave but from
  want and the boon that I ask is to have this small bag that thou seest filled
  with meat.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;A request within reason is this,&quot; said he, &quot;
  and gladly shalt thou have it. Bring him food.&quot;</P>

  <P ALIGN="center">
</P>

  <P>
A great number of attendants arose, and began to fill the bag;
  but for all that they put into it, it was no fuller than at first.</P>

  <P>
&quot;My soul,&quot; said Gwawi, &quot;will thy bag be ever
  full ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;It will not, I declare to Heaven,&quot; said he,
  &quot;for all that may be put into it, unless one possessed of lands and
  domains and treasure shall arise, and tread down with both his feet the food
  which is within the bag, and shall say, 'Enough has been put herein.' &quot;</P>

  <P>
Then said Rhiannon unto Gwawl the son of Clud, &quot;Rise up
  quickly.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will willingly arise,&quot; said he. So he rose up,
  and put his two feet into the bag. And Powel turned up the sides of the bag,
  so that Gwawl was over his head in it. And he shut it up quickly, and slipped
  a knot upon the thongs, and blew his horn. And thereupon behold his household
  came down upon the palace. And they seized all the host that had come with
  Gwawl, and cast them into his own prison. And Powel threw off his rags, and
  his old shoes, and his tattered array. And as they came in, every one of
  Powel's knights struck a blow upon the bag, and asked, &quot; What is here
  ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;A badger,&quot; said they. And in this manner they
  played, each of them striking the bag, either with his foot or with a staff.
  And thus played they with the bag. Every one as he came in asked, &quot;What
  game are you playing at thus?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;The game of Badger in the Bag,&quot; said they. And then
  was the game of Badger in the Bag first played.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord,&quot; said the man in the bag, &quot;if thou
  wouldest but hear me, I merit not to be slain in a bag.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Said Heveyth H&#234;n, &quot;Lord, he speaks truth. It were
  fitting that thou listen to him ; for he deserves not this.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Verily,&quot; said Powel, &quot;I will do thy counsel
  concerning him.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Behold, this is my counsel then,&quot; said Rhiannon
  &quot;Thou art now in a position in which it behoves thee to satisfy suitors
  and minstrels let him give unto them in thy stead, and take a pledge from him
  that he will never seek to revenge that which has been done to him. And this
  will he punishment enough.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will do this gladly,&quot; said the man in the bag.</P>

  <P>
&quot;And gladly will I accept it,'' said Powel, '' since it
  is the counsel of Heveyth and Rhiannon.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Such, then, is our counsel,&quot; answered they.</P>

  <P>
&quot;I accept it,&quot; said Powel.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Seek thyself sureties.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;We will be for him,&quot; said Heveyth, until his men be
  free to answer for him.&quot; And upon this he was let out of the bag, and his
  liege-men were liberated. Demand now of Gwawl his sureties,&quot; said Heveyth
  : &quot;we know which should be taken for him.&quot; And Heveyth numbered the
  sureties.</P>

  <P>
Said Gwawl, &quot; Do thou thyself draw up the covenant.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;It will suffice me that it be as Rhiannon said,&quot;
  answered Powel. So unto that covenant were all the sureties pledged.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Verily, lord,&quot; said Gwawl<I> </I>&quot;I am greatly
  hurt, and I have many bruises. I have need to be anointed ; with thy<I> </I>leave
  I will go forth. I will leave nobles in my stead to answer for me in all that
  thou shalt require.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Willingly,&quot; said Powel, &quot; mayest thou do
  thus.&quot; So Gwawl went towards his own possessions.</P>

  <P>
And the hall was set in order for Powel and the men of his
  host, and for them also of the palace, and they went to the tables and sat
  down. And as they had sat that time twelvemonth, so sat they that night. And
  they ate and feasted, and spent the night in mirth and tranquillity.</P>

  <P>
And next morning, at the break of day, &quot;My lord,&quot;
  said Rhiannon, &quot;arise and begin to give thy gifts unto the minstrels.
  Refuse no one to-day that may claim thy bounty.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Thus shall it be, gladly,&quot; said Powel, &quot;both
  to-day and every day while the feast shall last.&quot; So Powel arose, and he
  caused silence to be proclaimed, and desired all the suitors and the minstrels
  to show and to point out what gifts were to their wish and desire. And this
  being done, the feast went on, and he denied no one while it lasted. And when
  the feast was ended, Powel said unto Heveyth, <I>&quot;</I>My<I> </I>lord,
  with thy permission, I will set out for Dyved to-morrow.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Heveyth. &quot;May Heaven prosper
  thee! Fix also a time when Rhiannon may follow thee.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Said Powel, &quot; We will go hence together.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Willest thou this, lord ?&quot; said Heveyth.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Powel.</P>

  <P>
And the next day they set forward towards Dyved, and journeyed
  to the palace of Narberth, where a feast was made ready for them. And there
  came to them great numbers of the chief men and the most noble ladies of the
  land, and of these there was none to whom Rhiannon did not give some rich
  gift, either a bracelet, or a ring, or a precious stone. And they ruled the
  land prosperously both that year and the next.</P>

  <P>
And in the fourth year a son was born to them, and women were
  brought to watch the babe at night. And the women slept, as did also Rhiannon.
  And when they awoke they looked where they had put the boy, and behold he was
  not there. And the women were frightened ; and, having plotted together, they
  accused Rhiannon of having murdered her child before their eyes.</P>

  <P>
&quot;For pity's sake,&quot; said Rhiannon, &quot;the Lord God
  knows all things. Charge me not falsely. If you tell me this from fear, I
  assert before Heaven that I will defend you.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Truly,&quot; said they, &quot;we would not bring evil on
  ourselves for any<I> </I>one in the world.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;For pity's sake,&quot; said Rhiannon, &quot;you will
  receive no evil by telling the truth.&quot; But for all her words, whether
  fair or harsh, she received but the same answer from the women.</P>

  <P>
And Powel the chief of Annuvyn arose, and his household and
  his hosts. And this occurrence could not be concealed; but the story went
  forth throughout the land, and all the nobles heard it. Then the nobles came
  to Powel, and besought him to put away his wife because of the great crime
  which she had done. But Powel answered them that they had no cause wherefore
  they might ask him to put away his wife.</P>

  <P>
So Rhiannon sent for the teachers and the wise men, and as she
  preferred doing penance to contending with the women, she took upon her a
  penance. And the penance that was imposed upon her was that she should remain
  in that palace of Narberth until the end of seven years, and that she should
  sit every day near unto a horse-block that was without the gate ; and that she
  should relate the story to all who should come there whom she might suppose
  not to know it already; and that she should offer the guests and strangers, if
  they would permit her, to carry them upon her back into the palace. But it
  rarely happened that any would permit. And thus did she spend part of the
  year.</P>

  <P>
Now at that time Teirnyon Twryv Vliant was lord of Gwent Is
  Coed, and he was the best man in the world. And unto his house there belonged
  a mare than which neither mare nor horse in the kingdom was more beautiful.
  And on the night of every first of May she foaled, and no one ever knew what
  became of the colt. And one night Teirnyon talked with his wife:
  &quot;Wife,&quot; said he, &quot;it is very simple of us that our mare should
  foal every year, and that we should have none of her colts.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;What can be done in the matter?&quot; said she.</P>

  <P>
&quot;This is the night of the first of May,&quot; said he.
  &quot;The vengeance of Heaven be upon me, if I learn not what it is that takes
  away the colts.&quot; So he armed himself, and began to watch that night.
  Teirnyon heard a great tumult, and after the tumult behold a claw came through
  the window into the house, and it seized the colt by the mane. Then Teirnyon
  drew his sword, and struck off the arm at the elbow: so that portion of the
  arm, together with the colt, was in the house with him. And then did he hear a
  tumult and wailing both at once. And he opened the door, and rushed out in the
  direction of the noise, and he could not see the cause of the tumult because
  of the darkness of the night; but he rushed after it and followed it. Then he
  remembered that he had left the door open, and he returned. And at the door
  behold there was an infant-boy in swaddling clothes, wrapped around in a
  mantle of satin. And he took up the boy, and behold he was very strong for the
  age that he was of.</P>

  <P>
Then he shut the door, and went into the chamber where his
  wife was. &quot; Lady,&quot; said he, &quot;art thou sleeping ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;No, lord,&quot; said she: &quot;I was asleep, but as
  thou camest in I did awake.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Behold, here is a boy for thee, if thou wilt,&quot; said
  he, &quot;since thou hast never had one.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;My lord,&quot; said she, &quot;what adventure is this
  ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;It was thus,&quot; said Teirnyon. And he told her how it
  all befell.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Verily, lord,&quot; said she, &quot; what sort of
  garments are there upon the boy?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;A mantle of satin,&quot; said he.</P>

  <P ALIGN="center">
</P>

  <P>
&quot;He is then a boy of gentle lineage,&quot; she replied.
  And they caused the boy to be baptised, and the ceremony was performed there.
  And the name which they gave unto him was Goldenlocks, because what hair was
  upon his head was as yellow as gold. And they had the boy nursed in the court
  until he was a year old. And before the year was over he could walk stoutly ;
  and he was larger than a boy of three years old, even one of great growth and
  size. And the boy was nursed the second year, and then he was as large as a
  child six years old. And before the end of the fourth year, he would bribe the
  grooms to allow him to take the horses to water.</P>

  <P>
&quot;My lord,&quot; said his wife unto Tiernyon, &quot; where
  is the colt which thou didst save on the night that thou didst find the boy
  ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I have commanded the grooms of the horses,&quot; said
  he, &quot;that they take care of him.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Would it not be well, lord,&quot; said she, &quot;if
  thou wert to cause him to be broken in, and given to the boy, seeing that on
  the same night that thou didst find the boy, the colt was foaled, and thou
  didst save him?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I will not oppose thee in this matter,&quot; said
  Tiernyon. &quot;I will allow thee to give him the colt.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord,&quot; said she, &quot;may Heaven reward thee ! I
  will give it him.&quot; So the horse was given to the boy. Then she went to
  the grooms and those who tended the horses, and commanded them to be careful
  of the horse, so that he might be broken ii' by the time that the boy could
  ride him.</P>

  <P>
And while these things were going forward, they heard tidings
  of Rhiannon and her punishment. And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant, by reason of the
  pity that he felt on hearing this story of Rhiannon and her punishment,
  inquired closely concerning it, until he had heard from many of those who came
  to his court. Then did Teirnyon, often lamenting the sad history, ponder with
  himself; and he looked steadfastly on the boy, and as he looked upon him, it
  seemed to him that he had never beheld so great a likeness between father and
  son as between the boy and Powel the chief of Annuvyn. Now the semblance of
  Powel was well known to him, for he had of yore been one of his followers. And
  thereupon he became grieved for the wrong that he did in keeping with him a
  boy whom he knew to be the son of another man. And the first time that he was
  alone with his wife he told her that it was not right that they should keep
  the boy with them, and suffer so excellent a lady as Rhiannon to be punished
  so greatly on his account, whereas the boy was the son of Powel the chief of
  Annuvyn. And Teirnyon's wife agreed with him that they should send the boy to
  Powel. &quot;And three things, lord,&quot; said she, &quot;shall we gain
  thereby - thanks and gifts for releasing Rhiannon from her punishment, and
  thanks from Powel for nursing his son and restoring him unto him ; and,
  thirdly, if the boy is of gentle nature, he will be our foster-son, and he
  will do for us all the good in his power.&quot; So it was settled according to
  this counsel.</P>

  <P>
And no later than the next day was Teirnyon equipped and two
  other knights with him. And the boy, as a fourth in their company, went with
  them upon the horse which Teirnyon had given him. And they journeyed towards
  Narberth, and it was not long before they reached that place. And as they drew
  near to the palace, they beheld Rhiannon sitting beside the horse-block. And
  when they were opposite to her, &quot; Chieftain,&quot; said she, &quot; go
  not farther thus &quot;I will bear every one of you into the palace. And this
  is my penance for slaying my own son, and devouring him.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Oh, fair lady,&quot; said Teirnyon, &quot;think not that
  I will be one to be carried upon thy back.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Neither will I,&quot; said the boy.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Truly, my soul,&quot; said Teirnyon, &quot; we will not
  go.&quot; So they went forward to the palace, and there was great joy at their
  coming. And at the palace a feast was prepared because Powel was come back
  from the confines of Dyfed And they went into the hall and washed, and Powel
  rejoiced to see Teirnyon. And in this order they sat Teirnyon between Powel
  and Rhiannon, and Teirnyon's two companions on the other side of Powel, with
  the boy between them. And after meat they began to carouse and discourse. And
  Teirnyon's discourse was concerning the adventure of the mare and the boy, and
  how he and his wife had nursed and reared the child as their own. &quot;Behold
  here is thy son, lady,&quot; said Teirnyon. &quot;And whosoever told that lie
  concerning thee has done wrong. When I heard of thy sorrow, I was troubled and
  grieved. And I believe that there is none of this host who will not perceive
  that the boy is the son of Powel,&quot; said Teirnyon.</P>

  <P>
&quot;There is none,&quot; said they all, &quot; who is not
  certain thereof.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I declare to Heaven,&quot; said Rhiannon, &quot;that if
  this be true, there is indeed an end to my trouble.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lady,&quot; said Pendaran Dyfed, &quot;well hast thou
  named thy son Pryderi (end of trouble), and well becomes him the name of
  Pryderi son of Powel chief of Annuvyn.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Look you,&quot; said Rhiannon &quot;will not his own
  name become him better?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;What name has he ?&quot; asked Pendaran Dyfed.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Goldenlocks is the name that we gave him.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Pryderi,&quot; said Pendaran, &quot;shall his name
  be.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;It were more proper,&quot; said Powel, &quot;that the
  boy should take his name from the word his mother spoke when she received the
  joyful tidings of him.&quot; And thus was it arranged.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Teirnyon,&quot; said Powel, &quot;Heaven reward thee
  that thou hast reared the boy up to this time, and, being of gentle lineage,
  it were fitting that he repay thee for it.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;My lord,&quot; said Teirnyon, &quot;it was my wife who
  nursed him, and there is no one in the world so afflicted as she at parting
  with him. It were well that he should bear in mind what I and my wife have
  done for him.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I call Heaven to witness,&quot; said Powel, &quot;that
  while I live I will support thee and thy possessions as long as I am able to
  preserve my own. And when he shall have power, he will more fitly maintain
  them than I. And if this counsel be pleasing unto thee and to my nobles, it
  shall be, that, as thou hast reared him up to the present time, I will give
  him to be brought up by Pendaran Dyfed from henceforth. And you shall be
  companions, and shall both be foster-fathers unto him.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;This is good counsel,&quot; said they all. So the boy
  was given to Pendaran Dyfed, and the nobles of the land were sent with him.
  And Teirnyon Twryv VIant and his companions set out for his country and his
  possessions, with love and gladness. And he went not without being offered the
  fairest jewels, and the fairest horses, and the choicest dogs; but he would
  take none of them.</P>

  <P>
Thereupon they all remained in their own dominions. And
  Pryderi the son of Powel the chief of Annuvyn was brought up carefully, as was
  fit, so that he became the fairest youth, and the most comely, and the best
  skilled in all good games, of any in the kingdom. And thus passed years and
  years until the end of Powel the chief of Annuvyn's life came, and he died.</P>
