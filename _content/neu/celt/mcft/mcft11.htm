<CENTER><H1>The Greek Princess and the Young Gardener</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
THERE
  was once a king, but I didn't hear what country he was over, and he had one
  very beautiful daughter. Well, he was getting old and sickly, and the doctors
  found out that the finest medicine in the world for him was the apples of a
  tree that grew in the orchard just under his window. So you may be sure he had
  the tree well minded, and used to get the apples counted from the time they
  were the size of small marbles. One harvest, just as they were beginning to
  turn ripe, the king was awakened one night by the flapping of wings outside in
  the orchard ; and when he looked out, what did he see but a bird among the
  branches of his tree. Its feathers were so bright that they made a light all
  round them, and the minute it saw the king in his night-cap and night-shirt it
  picked off an apple, and flew away &quot;Oh, botheration to that thief of a
  gardener! &quot; says the king, &quot;this is a nice way he's watching my
  precious fruit.&quot;</P>

  <P>
He didn't sleep a wink the rest of the night and as soon as
  any one was stirring in the palace, he sent for the gardener, and abused him
  for his neglect.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Please your Majesty!&quot; says he, &quot; not another
  apple you shall lose. My three sons are the best shots at the bow and arrow in
  the kingdom, and they and myself will watch in turn every night.&quot;</P>

  <P>
When the night came, the gardener's eldest son took his post
  in the garden, with his bow strung and his arrow between his fingers, and
  watched, and watched. But at the dead hour, the king, that was wide awake,
  heard the flapping of wings, and ran to the window. There was the bright bird
  in the tree, and the boy fast asleep, sitting with his back to the wall, and
  his bow on his lap.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Rise, you lazy thief ! &quot; says the king, '' there's
  the bird again, botheration to her !&quot;</P>

  <P>
Up jumped the poor fellow ; but while he was fumbling with the
  arrow and the string, away was the bird with the nicest apple on the tree.
  Well, to be sure, how the king fumed and fretted, and how he abused the
  gardener and the boy, and what a twenty-four hours he spent till midnight came
  again !</P>


<P>
He had his eye this time on the second son of
the gardener; but though he was up and lively enough when the clock began to
strike twelve, it wasn't done with the last bang when he saw him stretched like
one dead on the long grass, and saw the bright bird again, and heard the flap of
her wings, and saw her carry away the third apple. The poor fellow woke with the
roar the king let at him, and even was in time enough to let fly an arrow after
the bird. He did not hit her, you may depend; and though the king was mad
enough, he saw the poor fellows were under ' <I>pishtrogues, </I>and could not
help it.</P>


<P>
Well, he had some hopes out of the youngest, for he was a brave,
active young fellow, that had everybody's good word. There he was ready, and
there was the king watching him, and talking to him at the first stroke of
twelve. At the last clang, the brightness coming before the bird lighted up the
wall and the trees, and the rushing of the wings was heard as it flew into the
branches ; but at the same instant the crack of the arrow on her side might be
heard a quarter of a mile off. Down came the arrow and a large bright feather
along with it, and away was the bird, with a screech that was enough to break
the drum of your ear. She hadn't time to carry off an apple; and bedad, when the
feather was thrown up into the king's room it was heavier than lead, and turned
out to be the finest beaten gold.</P>

<P>
Well, there was great <I>cooramuch </I>made about the youngest
boy next day, and he watched night after night for a week, but not a mite of a
bird or bird's feather was to be seen, and then the king told him to go home and
sleep. Every one admired the beauty of the gold feather beyond anything, but the
king was fairly bewitched. He was turning it round and round, and rubbing it
against his forehead and his nose the live-long day; and at last he proclaimed
that he'd give his daughter and half his kingdom to whoever would bring him the
bird with the gold feathers, dead or alive.</P>

<P>
The gardener's eldest son had great conceit of himself and away
he went to look for the bird. In the afternoon he sat down under a tree to rest
himself; and eat a bit of bread and cold meat that he had in his wallet, when up
comes as fine a looking fox as you'd see in the burrow of Munfin. &quot; Musha,
sir,&quot; says he, &quot; would you spare a bit of that meat to a poor body
that's hungry?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot; Well,&quot; says the other, &quot; you must have the
divil's own assurance, you common robber, to ask me such a question. Here's the
answer,&quot; and he let fly at the <I>moddhereen rua.</P>

</I>
<P>
The arrow scraped from his side up over his back, as if he was
made of hammered iron, and stuck in a tree a couple of perches off.</P>

<P>
&quot;Foul play,&quot; says the fox ; but I respect your young
brother, and will give a bit of advice. At nightfall you'll come into a village.
One side of the street you'll see a large room lighted up, and filled with young
men and women, dancing and drinking. The other side you'll see a house with no
light, only from the fire in the front room, and no one near it but a man and
his wife, and their child. Take a fool's advice, and get lodging there.&quot;
With that he curled his tail over his crupper, and trotted off.</P>

<P>
The boy found things as the fox said, but <I>begonies </I>he
chose the dancing and drinking, and there we'll leave him. In a week's time,
when they got tired at home waiting for him, the second son said he'd try his
fortune, and off he set. He was just as ill-natured and foolish as his brother,
and the same thing happened to him. Well, when a week was over, away went the
youngest of all, and as sure as the hearth-money, he sat under the same tree,
and pulled out his bread and meat, and the same fox came up and saluted him.
Well, the young fellow shared his dinner with the <I>moddhereen, </I>and he
wasn't long beating about the bush, but told the other he knew all about his
business.</P>

<P>
&quot;I'll help you,&quot; says he, &quot;if I find you're
biddable. So just at nightfall you'll come into a village &#133; Good-bye till
to-morrow.&quot;</P>

<P>
It was just as the fox said, but the boy took care not to go
near dancer, drinker, fiddler, or piper. He got welcome in the quiet house to
supper and bed, and was on his journey next morning before the sun was the
height of the trees.</P>

<P>
He wasn't gone a quarter of a mile when he saw the fox coming
out of a wood that was by the roadside.</P>

<P>
&quot;Good-morrow, fox,&quot; says one.</P>

<P>
&quot;Good-morrow, sir,&quot; says the other.</P>

<P>
&quot;Have you any notion how far you have to travel till you
find the garden bird?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Dickens a notion have I ; - how could I ?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Well, I have. She's in the King of Spain's palace, and
that's a good two hundred miles off.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh, dear! we'll be a week going.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;No, we won't. Sit down on my tail, and we'll soon make the
road short.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Tail, indeed ! that 'ud be the droll saddle, my poor <I>moddhereen.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Do as I tell you, or I'll leave you to yourself.&quot;</P>

<P>
Well, rather than vex him he sat down on the tail that was
spread out level like a wing, and away they went like thought. They overtook the
wind that was before them, and the wind that came after didn't overtake them. In
the afternoon, they stopped in a wood near the King of Spain's palace, and there
they stayed till nightfall.</P>

<P>
&quot;Now,&quot; says the fox, &quot;I'll go before you to make
the minds of the guards easy, and you'll have nothing to do but go from lighted
hall to another lighted hall till you find the golden bird in the last. If you
have a head on you, you'll bring himself and his cage outside the door, and no
one then can lay hands on him or you. If you haven't a head I can't help you,
nor no one else.&quot; So he went over to the gates.</P>

<P>
In a quarter of an hour the boy followed, and in the first hall
he passed he saw a score of armed guards standing upright, but all dead asleep.
In the next he saw a dozen, and in the next half a dozen, and in the next three,
and in the room beyond that there was no guard at all, nor lamp, nor candle, but
it was as bright as day ; for there was the golden bird in a common wood and
wire cage, and on the table were the three apples turned into solid gold.</P>


<P>
On the same table was the most lovely golden
cage eye ever beheld, and it entered the boy's head that it would be a thousand
pities not to put the precious bird into it, the common cage was so unfit for
her. Maybe he thought of the money it was worth ; anyhow he made the exchange,
and he had soon good reason to be sorry for it. The instant the shoulder of the
bird's wing touched the golden wires, he let such a <I>squawk </I>out of him as
was enough to break all the panes of glass in the windows, and at the same
minute the three men, and the half-dozen, and the dozen, and the score men, woke
up and clattered their swords and spears, and surrounded the poor boy, and
jibed, and cursed, and swore at home, till he didn't know whether it's his foot
or head he was standing on. They called the king, and told him what happened,
and he put on a very grim face. &quot;It's on a gibbet you ought to be this
moment,&quot; says he, &quot; but I'll give you a chance of your life, and of
the golden bird, too. I lay you under prohibitions, and restrictions, and death,
and destruction, to go and bring me the King of <I>Moroco's </I>bay filly that
outruns the wind, and leaps over the walls of castle-bawns. When you fetch it
her into the bawn of this palace, you must get the golden bird, and liberty to
go where you please.&quot;</P>


<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
Out passed the boy, very down-hearted, but as he went along, who
should come out of a brake but the fox again.</P>

<P>
&quot;Ah, my friend,&quot; says he, &quot; I was right when I
suspected you hadn't a head on you; but I won't rub your hair again' the grain.
Get on my tail again, and when we come to the King of Moroco's paIace, we'll see
what we can do.&quot;</P>

<P>
So away they went like thought. The wind that was before them
they would overtake the wind that was behind them would not overtake them.</P>

<P>
Well, the nightfall came on them in a wood near the palace, and
says the fox, ' I'll go and make things easy for you at the stables, and when
you are leading out the filly, don't let her touch the door, nor doorposts, nor
anything but the ground, and that with her hoofs and if you haven't a head on
you once you are in the stable, you'll be worse off than before.&quot;</P>

<P>
So the boy delayed for a quarter of an hour, and then he went
into the big bawn of the palace. There were two rows of armed men reaching from
the gate to the stable, and every man was in the depth of deep sleep, and
through them went the boy till he got into the stable. There was the filly, as
handsome a beast as ever stretched leg, and there was one stable-boy with a
currycomb in his hand, and another with a bridle, and another with a sieve of
oats, and another with an armful of hay, and all as if they were cut out of
stone. The filly was the only live thing in the place except himself. She had a
common wood and leather saddle on her back, but a golden saddle with the nicest
work on it was hung from the post, and he thought it the greatest pity not to
put it in place of the other. Well, I believe there was some <I>pishrogues </I>over
it for a saddle ; anyhow, he took off the other, and put the gold one in its
place.</P>


<P>
Out came a squeal from the filly's throat
when she felt the strange article, that might be heard from Tombrick to
Bunclody, and all as ready were the armed men and the stable-boys to run and
surround the <I>ornadhan </I>of a boy, and the King of Moroco was soon there
along with the rest, with a face on him as black as the sole of your foot. After
he stood enjoying the abuse the poor boy got from every-body for some time, he
says to him, &quot;You deserve high hanging for your impudence, but l'll give
you a chance for your life and the filly, too. I lay on you all sorts of
prohibitions, and restrictions, and death, and destruction to go bring me
Princess Golden Locks, the King of Greek's daughter. When you deliver her into
my hand, you may have the 'daughter of the wind,' and welcome. Come in and take
your supper and your rest, and be off at the flight of night.&quot;</P>


<P>
The poor boy was down in the mouth, you may suppose, as he was
walking away next morning, and very much ashamed when the fox looked up in his
face after coming out of the wood.</P>

<P>
&quot;What a thing it is,&quot; says he, &quot;not to have a
head when a body wants it worst ; and here we have a fine long journey before us
to the King of Greek's palace. The worse luck now, the same always. Here, get on
my tail, and we'll be making the road shorter.&quot;</P>

<P>
So he sat on the fox's tail, and swift as thought they went. The
wind that was before them they would overtake it, the wind that was behind them
would not overtake them, and in the evening they were eating their bread and
cold meat in the wood near the castle.</P>


<P>
&quot;Now,&quot; says the fox, when they were
done, &quot;I'll go before you to make things easy. Follow me in a quarter of an
hour. Don't let Princess Golden Locks touch the jambs of the doors with her
hands, or hair, or clothes, and if you're asked any favour, mind how you answer.
Once she's outside the door, no one can take her from you.&quot;</P>


<P>
Into the palace walked the boy at the proper time, and there
were the score, and the dozen, and the half-dozen, and the three guards all
standing up or leaning on their arms, and all dead asleep, and in the farthest
room of all was the Princess Golden Locks, as lovely as Venus herself. She was
asleep in one chair, and her father, the King of Greek, in another. He stood
before her for ever so long with the love sinking deeper into his heart every
minute. till at last he went down on one knee, and took her darling white hand
in his hand, and kissed it.</P>

<P>
When she opened her eyes, she was a little frightened, but I
believe not very angry, for the boy, as I call him, was a fine handsome young
fellow, and all the respect and love that ever you could think of was in his
face. She asked him what he wanted, and he stammered, and blushed, and began his
story six times, before she understood it.</P>

<P>
&quot;And would you give me up to that ugly black King of Moroco
?&quot; says she.</P>

<P>
&quot;I am obliged to do so,&quot; says he, &quot; by
prohibitions, and restrictions, and death, and destruction, but I'll have his
life and free you, or lose my own. If I can't get you for my wife, my days on
the earth will be short.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Well,&quot; says she, &quot;let me take leave of my father
at any rate.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Ah, I can't do that,&quot; says he, &quot; or they'd all
waken, and myself would be put to death, or sent to some task worse than any I
got yet.&quot;</P>

<P>
But she asked leave at any rate to kiss the old man; that
wouldn't waken him, and then she'd go. How could he refuse her, and his heart
tied up in every curl of her hair? But, bedad, the moment her lips touched her
father's, he let a cry, and every one of the score, the dozen guards woke up,
and clashed their arms, and were going to make <I>gibbets </I>of the foolish
boy.</P>

<P>
But the king ordered them to hold their hands, till he'd be <I>insensed
</I>of what it was all about, and when he heard the boy's story he gave him a
chance for his life.</P>

<P>
&quot;There is,&quot; says he, &quot;a great heap of clay in
front of the palace, that won't let the sun shine on the walls in the middle of
summer. Every one that ever worked at it found two shovelfuls added to it for
every one they threw away. Remove it, and I'll let my daughter go with you. If
you're the man I suspect you to be, I think she'll be in no danger of being wife
to that yellow <I>Molott.</I>&quot;</P>

<P>
Early next morning was the boy tackled to his work, and for
every shovelful he flung away two came back on him, and at last he could hardly
get out of the heap that gathered round him. Well, the poor fellow scrambled out
some way, and sat down on a sod, and he'd have cried only for the shame of it.
He began at it in ever so many places, and one was still worse than the other,
and in the heel of the evening, when he was sitting with his head between his
hands, who should be standing before him but the fox.</P>

<P>
&quot;Well, my poor fellow,&quot; says he, &quot;you're low
enough. Go in: I won't say anything to add to your trouble. Take your supper and
your rest : to-morrow will be a new day.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;How is the work going off?&quot; says the king, when they
I were at supper.</P>

<P>
&quot;Faith, your Majesty,&quot; says the poor boy, &quot;it's
not going off; but coming on it is. I suppose you'll have the trouble of digging
me out at sunset to-morrow, and waking me.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;I hope not,&quot; says the princess, with a smile on her
kind face; and the boy was as happy as anything the rest of the evening.</P>

<P>
He was wakened up next morning with voices shouting, and bugles
blowing, and drums beating, and such a hullibullo he never heard in his life
before. He ran out to see what was the matter, and there, where the heap of clay
was the evening before, were soldiers, and servants, and lords, and ladies,
dancing like mad for joy that it was gone.</P>

<P>
&quot;Ah, my poor fox !&quot; says he to himself; &quot;this is
your work.&quot;</P>

<P>
Well, there was little delay about his return. The king was
going to send a great retinue with the princess and himself; but he wouldn't let
him take the trouble.</P>

<P>
&quot;I have a friend,&quot; says he, &quot;that will bring us
both to the King of Moroco's palace in a day, d -- fly away with him !&quot;</P>

<P>
There was great crying when she was parting from her father.</P>

<P>
&quot;Ah ! &quot; says he, &quot;what a lonesome life I'll have
now! Your poor brother in the power of that wicked witch, and kept away from us,
and now you taken from me in my old age!&quot;</P>

<P>
Well, they both were walking on through the wood, and he telling
her how much he loved her; out walked the fox from behind a brake, and in a
short time he and she were sitting on the brush, and holding one another fast
for fear of slipping off; and away they went like thought. The wind that was
before them they would overtake it, and in the evening he and she were in the
big bawn of the King of Moroco's castle.</P>

<P>
&quot;Well,&quot; says he to the boy, &quot;you've done your
duty well; bring out the bay filly. I'd give the full of the bawn of such
fillies, if I had them, for this handsome princess. Get on your steed, and here
is a good purse of guineas for the road.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; says he. &quot;I suppose you'll let me
shake hands with the princess before I start.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Yes, indeed, and welcome.&quot;</P>

<P>
Well, he was some little time about the hand-shaking, and before
it was over he had her fixed snug behind him; and while you could count three,
he, and she, and the filly were through all the guards, and a hundred perches
away.; On they went, and next morning they were in the wood near the King of
Spain's palace, and there was the fox before them.</P>

<P>
&quot;Leave your princess here with me,&quot; says he, &quot;and
go get the golden bird and the three apples. If you don't bring us back the
filly along with the bird, I must carry you both home myself.&quot;</P>

<P>
Well, when the King of Spain saw the boy and the filly in the
bawn, he made the golden bird, and the golden cage, and the golden apples be
brought out and handed to him, and was very thankful and very glad of his prize.
But the boy could not part with the nice beast without petting it and rubbing
it; and while no one was expecting such a thing, he was up on its back, and
through the guards, and a hundred perches away, and he wasn't long till he came
to where he left his princess and the fox.</P>

<P>
They hurried away till they were safe out of the King of Spain's
land, and then they went on easier; and if I was to tell you all the loving
things they said to one another, the story wouldn't be over till morning. When
they were passing the village of the dance house, they found his two brothers
begging, and they brought them along. When they came to where the fox appeared
first, he begged the young man to cut off his head and his tail.</P>

<P>
He would not do it for him ; he shivered at the very thought,
but the eldest brother was ready enough. The head and tail vanished with the
blows, and the body changed into the finest young man you could see, and who was
he but the princess's brother that was bewitched. Whatever joy they had before,
they had twice as much now, and when they arrived at the palace bonfires were
set blazing, oxes roasting, and puncheons of wine put out in the lawn.</P>

<P>
The young Prince of Greece was married to the king's daughter,
and the prince's sister to the gardener's son. He and she went a shorter way
back to her father's house, with many attendants, and the king was so glad of
the golden bird and the golden apples, that he had sent a waggon full of gold
and a waggon full of silver along with them.</P>
