<CENTER><H1>The Tail</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
THERE
  was a shepherd once who went out to the hill to look after his sheep. It was
  misty and cold, and he had much trouble to find them. At last he had them all
  but one ; and after much searching he found that one too in a peat hag, half
  drowned; so he took off his plaid, and bent down and took hold of the sheep's
  tail, and he pulled ! The sheep was heavy with water, and he could not lift
  her, so he took off his coat and he <I>pulled !! </I>but it was too much for
  him, so he spit on his hands, and took a good hold of the tail and he PULLED !
  ! and the tail broke! and if it had not been for that this tale would have
  been a great deal longer.</P>
