ERE are several additional predictions which have been wholly or partly
fulfilled. "The day will come when the Mackenzies will lose all their
possessions in Lochalsh, after which it will fall into the hands of an
Englishman, who shall be distinguished by great liberality to his
people, and lavish expenditure of money. He will have one son and two
daughters; and, after his death, the property will revert to the
Mathesons, its original possessors, who will build a Castle on
Druim-a-Dubh, at Balmacarra." The late Mr. Lillingstone was an
Englishman. He was truly distinguished for kindness and liberality to
his tenants, and he had a son and two daughters, although, we are
informed, he had been married for seventeen years before he had any
family. When he came into possession, old people thought they discerned
the fulfilment of a part of Kenneth's prediction in his person, until it
was remarked that he had no family as foretold by the Seer. At last, a
son and two daughters were successively born to Mr. Lillingstone. After
his death, the son sold the whole of Lochalsh to Alexander Matheson,
M.P. for the Counties of Ross and Cromarty, and, so far, the prediction
has been realized. A castle has been built at Duncraig, a considerable
distance from the

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

spot predicted by the Seer; but if Kenneth is to be depended upon, a
castle will yet be built by one of the Mathesons on Druim-a-Dubh, at
Balmacarra. Had this prophecy been got up after the event, the
reputation of the Seer would certainly not have been staked on the
erection of another castle in the remote future, when the Mathesons
already possess such a magnificent mansion at Duncraig.

During a recent visit to the Island of Raasay we received a peculiar
prediction regarding the Macleods from an old man there, over eighty
years of age, who remembered seven proprietors of Raasay, and who sorely
lamented the fulfilment of the prophecy, and the decline of the good old
stock, entirely in consequence of their own folly and extravagance.
Since then, we had the prediction repeated by a Kintail man in identical
terms; and as it is hardly translatable, we shall give it in the
original vernacular:--"Dar a thig Mac-Dhomhnuill Duibh bàn; Mac-Shimidh
ceann-dearg; Sisealach claon ruadh; Mac-Coinnich mor bodhar; agus
Mac-Gille-challum cama-chasach, iar-ogha Ian bhig à Ruiga, ’se sin a
Mac-Gille-challum is miosa ’thainig na thig; cha bhi mi ann ri linn, ’s
cha’n fhearr leam air a bhith." (When we shall have a fair-haired
Lochiel; a red-haired Lovat; a squint-eyed, fair-haired Chisholm; a big
deaf Mackenzie; and a bow-crooked-legged Mac-Gille-challum, who shall be
the great-grand-son of John Beg, or little John, of Ruiga: that
Mac-Gille-challum will be the worst that ever came or ever will come; I
shall not be in existence in his day, and I have no desire that I
should.) Ruiga is the name of a place in Skye. When the last Macleod of
Raasay was horn, an old sage in the district called upon his neighbour,
and told him, with an expression of great sorrow, that Mac-Gille-challum
of Raasay now had an heir, and his birth was a certain forerunner of the
extinction of his house. Such an

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

event as the birth of an heir had been hitherto, in this as in all other
Highland families, universally considered an occasion for great
rejoicing among the retainers. The other old man was amazed, and asked
the sage what he meant by such unusual and disloyal remarks. "Oh!"
answered he, "do you not know that this is the grand-grandson of John
Beg of Ruiga whom Coinneach Odhar predicted would be the worst of his
race." And so he undoubtedly proved himself to be, for he lost for ever
the ancient inheritance of his house, and acted generally in such a
manner as to fully justify the Seer's prediction; and what is still more
remarkable, the Highland lairds, with the peculiar characteristics and
malformations foretold by Kenneth, preceded or were the contemporaries
of the last Mac-Gille-challum of Raasay.

Here is a prediction of the downfall of another distinguished Highland
family--Clan Ranald of the Isles. "The day will come when the old wife
with the footless stocking (cailleach nam mogan) will drive the Lady of
Clan Ranald from Nunton House, in Benbecula." We. are informed that this
was fulfilled when the Macdonalds took the farm of Nunton, locally known
as "Baile na Caillich". Old Mrs. Macdonald was in the habit of wearing
these primitive articles of dress, and was generally known in the
district as "Cailleach nam Mogan". Clan Ranald and his lady, like many
more of our Highland chiefs, ultimately went to the wall, and the
descendants of the "old wife with the footless stocking" occupied, and,
for anything we know, still occupy the ancient residence of the
long-distinguished race of Clan Ranald of the Isles.

In the beginning of the seventeenth century, and during the Seer's
lifetime. there lived in Kintail an old man--Duncan Macrae--who was
curious to know by what means he should end his days. He applied to a
local female Seer,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

who informed him that he "would die by the sword" (le bàs a
chlaidheamh). This appeared so improbable in the case of such an old
man, who had taken part in so many bloody frays and invariably escaped
unhurt, that the matter was referred to the greater authority, Coinneach
Odhar. He corroborated the woman, but still the matter was almost
universally discredited in the district, and by none more so than by old
Duncan himself. However, years after, conviction was forced upon them;
for, according to the "Genealogy of the Macraes," written by the Rev.
John Macrae, minister of Dingwall, who died in 1704--"Duncan being an
old man in the year 1654, when General Monk, afterwards Duke of
Albemarle, came to Kintail, retired from his house in Glenshiel to the
hills, where, being found by some of the soldiers who had straggled from
the body of the army in hopes of plunder, and who, speaking to him
roughly, in a language he did not understand, he, like Old Orimanus,
drew his sword, &c., and was immediately killed by them. This was all
the blood that General Monk or his soldiers, amounting to 1500 men, had
drawn, and all the opposition he met with, although the Earl of
Middleton and Sir George Monro were within a few miles of them, and
advertised of their coming, Seaforth having been sent by Middleton to
the Isle of Skye and parts adjoining, to treat with the Macdonalds and
the Macleods, &c."

Regarding the evictions which would take place in the Parish of Petty,
he said, "The day will come, and it is not far off, when farm-steadings
will be so few and far between, that the crow of a cock shall not be
heard from the one steading to the other". This prediction has certainly
been fulfilled, for, in the days of the Seer there were no fewer than
sixteen tenants on the farm of Morayston alone.

On the south of the bay, at Petty, is an immense stone, of

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

at least eight tons weight, which formerly marked the boundary between
the estates of Culloden and Moray. On the 20th of February, 1799, it was
mysteriously removed from its former position, and carried about 260
yards into the sea. It is supposed by some that this was brought about
by an earthquake; others think that the stone was carried off by the
action of ice, combined with the influence of a tremendous hurricane,
which blew from the shore, during that fearful and stormy night. It was
currently reported, and pretty generally believed at the time, that his
Satanic Majesty had a finger in this work. Be that as it may, there is
no doubt whatever that the Brahan Seer predicted "that the day will come
when the Stone of Petty, large though it is, and high and dry upon the
land as it appears to people this day, will be suddenly found as far
advanced into the sea as it now lies away from it inland, and no one
will see it removed, or be able to account for its sudden and marvellous
transportation ".

The Seer was at one time in the Culloden district on some important
business. While passing over what is now so well known as the
Battlefield of Culloden, he exclaimed, "Oh! Drummossie, thy bleak moor
shall, ere many generations have passed away, be stained with the best
blood of the Highlands. Glad am I that I will not see that day, for it
will be a fearful period; heads will be lopped off by the score, and no
mercy will be shown or quarter given on either side." It is perhaps
unnecessary to point out how literally this prophecy has been fulfilled
on the occasion of the last battle fought on British soil. We have
received several other versions of it from different parts of the
country, almost all in identical terms.

"The time will come when whisky or dram shops will be so plentiful that
one may be met with almost at the head of

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

every plough furrow." (Thig an latha ’s am bi tighean-oil cho lionmhor
’s nach mor nach fhaicear tigh-osda aig ceann gach claise.) "Policemen
will become so numerous in every town that they may be met with at the
corner of every street." "Travelling merchants" \[pedlars and hawkers\]
"will be so plentiful that a person can scarcely walk a mile on the
public highway without meeting one of them."

The following is from "A Summer in Skye," by the late Alex. Smith,
author of "A Life Drama". Describing Dun-vegan Castle and its
surroundings, he says: "Dun Kenneth's prophecy has come to pass--'In the
days of Norman, son of the third Norman, there will be a noise in the
doors of the people, and wailing in the house of the widow; and Macleod
will not have so many gentlemen of his name as will row a five-oared
boat round the Maidens'. If the last trumpet had been sounded at the end
of the French war, no one but a Macleod would have risen out of the
churchyard of Dunvegan. If you want to see a chief (of the Macleods)
now-a-days you must go to London for him." There can be no question as
to these having been fulfilled to the letter.

"The day will come when a fox will rear a litter of cubs on the
hearthstone of Castle Downie." "The day will come when a fox, white as
snow, will be killed on the west coast of Sutherlandshire." "The day
will come when a wild deer will be caught alive at Chanonry Point, in
the Black Isle." All these things have come to pass.

With respect to the clearances in Lewis, he said" Many a long waste
feannag (rig, once arable) will yet be seen between Uig of the Mountains
and Ness of the Plains." That this prediction has been fulfilled to the
letter, no one acquainted with the country will deny.

The following would appear to have been made solely on

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

account of the unlikelihood of the occurrence:--"A Lochalsh woman shall
weep over the grave of a Frenchman in the burying-place of Lochalsh."
People imagined they could discern in this an allusion to some battle on
the West Coast, in which French troops would be engaged; but there was
an occurrence which gave it a very different interpretation. A native of
Lochalsh married a French footman, who died, shortly after this event,
and was interred in the burying-ground of Lochalsh, thus leaving his
widow to mourn over his grave. This may appear a commonplace matter
enough, but it must be remembered that a Frenchman in Lochalsh, and
especially a Frenchman whom a Highland woman would mourn over, in
Coinneach's day, was a very different phenomenon to what it is in our
days of railways, tourists, and steamboats.

The Seer also predicted the formation of a railway through the Muir of
Ord, handed down in the following stanza:--

Nuair a bhios da eaglais an Sgire na Toiseachd,  
A’s lamh da ordaig an I-Stian’,  
Da dhrochaid aig Sguideal nan geocaire,  
As fear da imleag an Dunean,  
Thig Miltearan a Carn a-chlarsair,  
Air Carbad gun each gun srian,  
A dh-fhagas am Blar-dubh na thasach,  
'Dortadh fuil le iomadh sgian;  
A’s olaidh am fitheach a thri saitheachd  
De dh-fhuil nan Gaidheal, bho clach nam Fionn.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Here is a literal
translation:--

When there shall be two churches in the Parish of Ferrintosh,  
And a hand with two thumbs in 'I-Stiana,"  
Two bridges at "Sguideal" (Conon) of the gormandizers,  
And a man with two navels at Duncan,  
Soldiers will come from "Cam a Chlarsair" (Tarradale)  
On a chariot without horse or bridle, <span id="page_35">p. 35</span>  
Which will leave the "Blar-dubh" (Muir of Ord) a wilderness,  
Spilling blood with many knives;  
And the raven shall drink his three fulls  
Of the blood of the Gael from the Stone of Fionn.

We already have two churches in the Parish of Ferrintosh, two bridges at
Conon, and we are told by an eye-witness, that there is actually at this
very time a man with two thumbs on each hand in " I-Stiana," in the
Black Isle, and a man in the neighbourhood of Dunean who has two navels.
The "chariot without horse or bridle" is undoubtedly the "iron horse".
What particular event the latter part of the prediction refers to, it is
impossible to say; but if we are to have any faith in the Seer,
something serious is looming not very remotely in the future.

Mr. Macintyre supplies the following, which is clearly a fragment of the
one above given:--Coinneach Odhar foresaw the formation of a railway
through the Muir of Ord which he said "would be a sign of calamitous
times". The prophecy regarding this is handed down to us in the
following form:--"I would not like to live when a black bridleless horse
shall pass through the Muir of Ord." "Fearchair a Ghunna" (Farquhar of
the Gun, an idiotic simpleton who lived during the latter part of his
extraordinary life on the Muir of Tarradale) seems, in his own quaint
way, to have entered into the spirit of this prophecy, when he compared
the train, as it first passed through the district, to the funeral of
"Old Nick". Tradition gives another version, viz.:--"that after four
successive dry summers, a fiery chariot shall pass through the 'Blar
Dubh,'" which has been very literally fulfilled. Coinneach Odhar was not
the only person that had a view beforehand of this railway line, for it
is commonly reported that a man residing in the neighbourhood of Beauly,
gifted with second-sight, had a vision of the train,

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

moving along in all its headlong speed, when he was on his way home one
dark autumn night, several years before the question of forming a
railway in those parts was mooted.

Here are two other Gaelic stanzas having undoubted reference to the
Mackenzies of Rosehaugh:--

Bheir Tanaistear Chlann Choinnich  
Rocus *bàn* ás a choille;  
’S bheir e ceile bho tigh-ciuil  
Le a mhuinntir ’na aghaidh;  
’S gum bi’ n Tanaistear mor  
Ann an gniomh ’s an ceann-labhairt,  
’Nuair bhios am Pap’ anns an Roimh  
Air a thilgeadh dheth chathair,

Thall fa chomhar Creag-a-Chodh  
Comhnuichidh taillear caol odhar;  
’S Seumas gorach mar thighearn,  
’S Seumas glic mar fhear tomhais--  
A mharcaicheas gun srian  
Air loth fhiadhaich a roghainn;  
Ach cuiridh mor-chuis gun chiall  
’N aite siol nam fiadh siol nan gobhar;  
’S tuitidh an t-Eilean-dubh briagha  
Fuidh riaghladh iasgairean Aŭch.

Literal translation:--

The heir (or chief) of the Mackenzies will take  
A *white* rook out of the wood,  
And will take a wife from a music house (dancing saloon),  
With his people against him!  
And the heir will be great  
In deeds and as an orator,  
When the Pope in Rome  
Will be thrown off his throne.

Over opposite *Creag-a-Chow*  
Will dwell a diminutive lean tailor,  
Also Foolish James as the laird,  
And Wise James as a measurer. <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>  
Who will ride without a bridle  
The wild colt of his choice;  
But foolish pride without sense  
Will put in the place of the seed of the deer the seed of the goat;  
And the beautiful Black Isle will fall  
Under the management of the fishermen of Avoch.

We have not learnt that any of the Rosehaugh Mackenzies has yet taken a
*white* rook from the woods; nor have we heard anything suggested as to
what this part of the prophecy may refer to. We are, however, credibly
informed that one of the late Mackenzies of Rosehaugh had taken his wife
from a music saloon in one of our southern cities, and that his people
were very much against him for so doing. One of them, Sir George, no
doubt was "great in deeds and as an orator," but we fail to discover any
connection between the time in which he lived and the time "when the
Pope in Rome will be thrown off his throne". We were unable in the first
edition to suggest the meaning of the first six lines of the last
stanza, but Mr. Maclennan supplies us with the following
explanation:--"I have been hearing these lines discussed since I was a
boy, and being a native of Rosehaugh, I took a special interest in
everything concerning it. The first two lines I was repeatedly informed,
referred to a pious man who lived on the estate of Bennetsfield,
opposite Craigiehow, when 'Seumas Gorach' (Foolish James referred to in
the third line), was proprietor of Rosehaugh. This godly man, who was
contemporary with Foolish James, often warned him of his end, and
predicted his fate if he did not mend his ways; and as he thus *cut* his
bounds for him, he is supposed to be the ' diminutive lean tailor'. He
is still in life. We all knew 'Foolish James'. The fourth line refers to
James Maclaren, who lived at Rosehaugh most of the time during which the
last two Mackenzies ruled over

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

it, and only died two years ago. He was an odd character, but a very
straightforward man; often rebuked 'Foolish James' for the reckless and
fearless manner in which he rode about, and set bounds before the
'foolish laird, which he was not allowed to pass. Maclaren was, on that
account, believed to be the 'measurer' referred to by the Seer. The
fifth and sixth lines are supposed to apply to the wife fancied by
Mackenzie in a 'dancing saloon,' who was always considered the 'wild
colt,' at whose instigation he rode so recklessly and foolishly." We
wish the realizations of our prophet's predictions in this case were a
little less fanciful.

Those in the seventh and eighth lines have been most literally
fulfilled, for there can be no doubt that "foolish pride without sense"
has brought about what the Seer predicted, and secured, for the present
at least, the seed of the goat where the seed of the deer used to rule.
The deer, and the deer's horns, as is well known, are the armorial
bearings of the Mackenzies, while the goat is that of the Fletchers, who
now rule in Rosehaugh, on the ruins of its once great and famous
"Cabair-feidh",

Part of the beautiful Black Isle has already fallen under the management
of the son of a fisherman of Avoch; and who knows but other fishermen
from that humble village may yet amass sufficient wealth to buy the
whole. The old proprietors, we regret, are rapidly making way with their
"foolish pride without sense," for some one to purchase it.

We are informed that the present proprietor of Rosehaugh is the son of
an Avoch fisherman--the son of a Mr. Jack, who followed that honourable
avocation in this humble village for many years; afterwards left the
place and went to reside in Elgin, where he commenced business as a
small general dealer, or "huckster"; that some of the boys--his

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

sons--exhibited a peculiar smartness while in school; that this was
noticed by a lady relative of their mother, an aunt, of the name of
Fletcher, who encouraged and helped on the education of the boys, and
who took one or more of them to her own home, and brought them up;
afterwards they found their way south, and ultimately became successful
merchants and landed proprietors. <span id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1)
These are facts of which we were entirely ignorant when first writing
down the stanzas already given. The verses were sent to us from various
quarters, and they have undoubtedly been floating about the country for
generations. So much for the Seer's prophetic power in this instance.
Were we better acquainted with the history of the other families
referred to in the stanzas, it is probable that more light could be
thrown upon what they refer to than we are at present able to do.

While we are dealing with the "wonderful" in connection with the House
of Rosehaugh, it may not be out of place to give a few instances of the
somewhat extraordinary experiences of the famous Sir George Mackenzie of
Rosehaugh already referred to. He was one of the most distinguished
members of the Scottish Bar, was Lord-Advocate for Scotland in the reign
of Charles the Second, and was, indeed, a contemporary of the Brahan
Seer. His "Institutes" are still considered a standing authority by the
legal profession:--On one occasion, while at Rosehaugh, a poor widow
from a neighbouring estate called to consult him regarding her being

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

repeatedly warned to remove from a small croft which she held under a
lease of several years; but as some time had yet to run before its
expiry, and being threatened with summary ejection from the croft, she
went to solicit his advice. Having examined the tenor of the lease, Sir
George informed her that it contained a flaw, which, in case of
opposition, would render her success exceedingly doubtful; and although
it was certainly an oppressive act to deprive her of her croft, he
thought her best plan was to submit. However, seeing the distressed
state of mind in which the poor woman was on hearing his opinion, he
desired her to call upon him the following day, when he would consider
her case more carefully. His clerk, who always slept in the same room as
his lordship, was not a little surprised, about midnight, to discover
him rising from his bed fast asleep, lighting a candle which stood on
his table, drawing in his chair, and commencing to write very busily, as
if he had been all the time wide awake. The clerk saw how he was
employed. but he never spoke a word, and, when he had finished, he saw
him place what he had written in his private desk, locking it,
extinguishing the candle, and then retiring to bed as if nothing had
happened. Next morning at breakfast, Sir George remarked that he had had
a very strange dream about the poor widow's threatened ejectment, which,
he could now remember, and he had now no doubt of making out a clear
case in her favour. His clerk rose from the table, asked for the key of
his desk, and brought therefrom several pages of manuscript; and, as he
handed them to Sir George, enquired--"Is that like your dream?" On
looking over it for a few seconds, Sir George said, "Dear me, this is
singular; this is my very dream!" He was no less surprised when his
clerk informed him of the manner in which he had acted; and, sending for
the widow, he told her what steps to

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

adopt to frustrate the efforts of her oppressors. Acting on the counsel
thus given, the poor widow was ultimately successful, and, with her
young family, was allowed to remain in possession of her "wee bit
croftie" without molestation.

Sir George principally resided at this time in Edinburgh, and, before
dinner, invariably walked for half-an-hour. The place he selected for
this was Leith Walk, then almost a solitary place. One day, while taking
his accustomed exercise, he was met by a venerable-looking, grey-headed
old gentleman, who accosted him and, without introduction or apology,
said--"There is a very important case to come off in London fourteen
days hence, at which your presence will be required. It is a case of
heirship to a very extensive estate in the neighbourhood of London, and
a pretended claimant is doing his utmost to disinherit the real heir, on
the ground of his inability to produce proper titles thereto. It is
necessary that you be there on the day mentioned; and in one of the
attics of the mansion-house on the estate there is an old oak chest with
two bottoms; between these you will find the necessary titles, written
on parchment." Having given this information, the old man disappeared,
leaving Sir George quite bewildered; but the latter, resuming his walk,
soon recovered his previous equanimity, and thought nothing further of
the matter.

Next day, while taking his walk in the same place, he was again met by
the same old gentleman, who earnestly urged him not to delay another day
in repairing to London, assuring him that he would be handsomely
rewarded for his trouble; but to this Sir George paid no particular
attention. The third day he was again met by the same hoary-headed sire,
who energetically pleaded with him not to lose a day in setting out,
otherwise the case would be lost. His singular deportment, and his
anxiety that Sir George should

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

be present at the discussion of the case, in which he seemed so deeply
interested, induced Sir George to give in to his earnest importunities,
and accordingly he started next morning on horseback, arriving in London
on the day preceding that on which the case was to come on. In a few
hours he was pacing in front of the mansion-house described by the old
man at Leith Walk, where he met two gentlemen engaged in earnest
conversation--one of the claimants to the property, and a celebrated
London barrister--to whom he immediately introduced himself as the
principal law-officer of the crown for Scotland. The barrister, no doubt
supposing that Sir George was coming to take the bread out of his mouth,
addressed him in a surly manner, and spoke disrespectfully of his
country; to which the latter replied, "that, lame and ignorant as his
learned friend took the Scotch to be, yet in law, as well as in other
respects, they would effect what would defy him and all his London
clique". This disagreeable dialogue was put an end to by the other
gentleman--the claimant to the property--taking Sir George into the
house. After sitting and conversing for some minutes, Sir George
expressed a wish to be shown over the house. The drawing-room was hung
all round with magnificent pictures and drawings, which Sir George
greatly admired; but there was one which particularly attracted his
attention; and after examining it very minutely, he, with a surprised
expression, inquired of his conductor whose picture it was? and received
answer--"It is my great-great-grandfather's". "My goodness!" exclaimed
Sir George, "the very man who spoke to me three times on three
successive days in Leith Walk, and at whose urgent request I came here!"
Sir George, at his own request, was then conducted to the attics, in one
of which there was a large mass of old papers, which was turned up and
examined

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

without discovering anything to assist them in prosecuting the claim to
the heirship of the property. However, as they were about giving up the
search, Sir George noticed an old trunk lying in a corner, which, his
companion told him, had lain there for many a year as lumber, and
contained nothing. The Leith Walk gentleman's information recurring to
Sir George, he gave the old moth-eaten chest a good hearty kick, such as
he could wish to have been received by his "learned friend" the
barrister, who spoke so disrespectfully of his country. The bottom flew
out of the trunk, with a quantity of chaff, among which the original
titles to the property were discovered. Next morning, Sir George entered
the court just as the case was about to be called and addressed the
pretended claimant's counsel--"Well, sir, what shall I offer you to
abandon this action?" "No sum, or any consideration whatever, would
induce me to give it up," answered his learned opponent. "Well, sir,"
said Sir George, at the same time pulling out his snuff-horn and taking
a pinch, "I will not even hazard a pinch on it." The case was called.
Sir George, in reply to the claimant's counsel, in an eloquent speech,
addressed the bench; exposed most effectually the means which had been
adopted to deprive his client of his birthright; concluded by producing
the titles found in the old chest; and the case was at once decided in
favour of his client. The decision being announced, Sir George took the
young heir's arm, and, bowing to his learned friend the barrister,
remarked, "You see now what a Scotsman has done, and let me tell you
that I wish a countryman of mine anything but a London barrister Sir
George immediately returned to Edinburgh, well paid for his trouble; but
he never again, in his favourite walk, encountered the old grey-headed
gentleman.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

The following two stanzas refer to the Mackenzies of Kilcoy and their
property:--

Nuair a ghlaodhas paisdean tigh Chulchallaidh,  
'Tha slige ar mortairean dol thairis!'  
Thig bho Chròidh madadh ruadh  
Bhi’s ’measg an t-sluaigh mar mhadadh-alluidh,  
Rè da-fhichead bliadhna a’s corr,  
’S gum bi na chòta iomadh mallachd;  
’N sin tilgear e gu falamh brònach  
Mar shean sguab air cùl an doruis;  
A’s bithidh an tuath mhor mar eunlaith sporsail,  
’S an tighearnan cho bochd ris na sporais--  
Tha beannachd ’san onair bhoiohich,  
A’s mallachd an dortadh na fola.

Nuair bhitheas caisteal ciar Chulchallaidh  
Na sheasaidh fuar, agus falamh,  
’S na cathagan ’s na rocuis  
Gu seolta sgiathail thairis,  
Gabhaidh duine graineal comhnuidh,  
Ri thaobh, mi-bheusal a’s salach,  
Nach gleidh guidhe stal-phosaidh,  
’S nach eisd ri cleireach no caraid,  
Ach bho Chreag-a-chodh gu Sgire na Toiseachd  
Gum bi muisean air toir gach caileag--  
A’s ochan! ochan! s’ ma leon,  
Sluigidh am balgaire suas moran talamh!

Literally translated:--

When the girls of Kilcoy house cry out,  
'The shell (cup) of our murderers is flowing over.'  
A fox from Croy will come  
Who shall be like a wolf among the people  
During forty years and more,  
And in his coat shall he many curses;  
He shall then be thrown empty and sorrowful,  
Like an old besom behind the door; <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>  
The large farmers will be like sportful birds,  
And the lairds as poor as the sparrows--  
There's a blessing in handsome honesty  
And curses in the shedding of blood.

When the stern Castle of Kilcoy  
Shall stand cold and empty,  
And the jackdaws and the rooks  
Are artfully flying past it,  
A loathsome man shall then dwell  
Beside it, indecent and filthy,  
Who will not keep the vow of the marriage coif,  
Listen neither to cleric nor friend;  
But from Creag-a-Chow to Ferrintosh  
The dirty fellow will be after every girl--  
Ochan! Ochan!! woe's me,  
The cunning dog will swallow up much land.

The history of the Kilcoy family has been an unfortunate one in late
years, and the second and last lines of the first stanza clearly refer
to a well-known tragic incident in the recent history of this once
highly-favoured and popular Highland family.

Mr. Maclennan applies them to an earlier event, and says:--"The second
and last line of the first stanza refer to the following story--Towards
the latter end of the seventeenth century a large number of cattle, in
the Black Isle, were attacked with a strange malady, which invariably
ended in madness and in death. The disease was particularly destructive
on the Kilcoy and Redcastle estates, and the proprietors offered a large
sum of money as a reward to any who should find a remedy. An old warlock
belonging to the parish agreed to protect the cattle from the ravages of
this unknown disease, for the sum offered, if they provided him with a
human sacrifice. To this ghastly proposal the lairds agreed. A large
barn at Parkton was, from its secluded position, selected as a suitable
place for the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

horrid crime, where a poor friendless man, who lived at Linwood, close
to the site of the present Free Church manse, was requested, under some
pretence, to appear on a certain day. The unsuspecting creature obeyed
the summons of his superiors; he was instantly bound and disembowelled
alive by the horrid wizard, who dried the heart, liver, kidneys,
pancreas, and reduced them to powder, of which he ordered a little to be
given to the diseased animals in water. Before the unfortunate victim
breathed his last, he ejaculated the following imprecation:--'Gum b’ ann
nach tig an latha ’bhitheas teaghlach a Chaisteil Ruaidh gun oinseach,
na teaghlach Chulchallaidh gun amadan'. (Let the day never come when the
family of Redcastle shall be without a female idiot, or the family of
Kilcoy without a fool.) It appears, not only that this wild imprecation
was to some extent realised, but also that the Brahan Seer, years
before, knew and predicted that it would be made, and that its prayer
would be ultimately granted."

Who the "fox from Croy" is, we are at present unable to suggest; but
taking the two stanzas as they stand, it would be difficult to describe
the position of the family and the state of the castle, with our present
knowledge of their history, and in their present position, more
faithfully than Coinneach Odhar has done more than two centuries ago.
What a faithful picture of the respective positions of the great farmers
and the lairds of the present day! And what a contrast between their
relative positions now and at the time when the Seer predicted the
change!

In the appendix to the Life of the late Dr. Norman Macleod, by his
brother, the Rev. Donald Macleod, D.D., a series of autobiographical
reminiscences are given, which the famous Rev. Norman, the Doctor's
father, dictated in his old age to one of his daughters. In the summer
of

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 1799 he visited
Dunvegan Castle, the stronghold of the Macleods, in the Isle of Skye.
Those of the prophecies already given in verse are, undoubtedly,
fragments of the long rhythmical productions of Coinneach Odhar
Fiosaiche's prophecies regarding most of our Highland families, to which
the Rev. Norman refers, and of which the prophecy given in his
reminiscences is as follows

"One circumstance took place at the Castle (Dunvegan) on this occasion
which I think worth recording, especially as I am the only person now
living who can attest the truth of it. There had been a traditionary
prophecy, couched in Gaelic verse, regarding the family of Macleod,
which on this occasion, received a most extraordinary fulfilment. This
prophecy I have heard repeated by several persons, and most deeply do I
regret that I did not take a copy of it when I could have got it. The
worthy Mr. Campbell of Knock, in Mull, had a very beautiful version of
it, as also had my father, and so, I think, had likewise Dr. Campbell of
Killinver. Such prophecies were current regarding almost all old
families in the Highlands; the Argyll family were of the number; and
there is a prophecy regarding the Breadalbane family as yet unfulfilled
which I hope may remain so. The present Marquis of Breadalbane is fully
aware of it, as are many of the connections of the family. Of the
Macleod family, it was prophesied at least a hundred years prior to the
circumstance which I am about to relate.

"In the prophecy to which I am about to allude, it was foretold that
when Norman, the Third Norman ('Tormad nan ’tri Tormaid'), the son of
the hard-boned English lady ('Mac na mnatha caoile cruaidhe
Shassunaich') would perish by an accidental death; that when the
'Maidens' of Macleod (certain well-known rocks on the coast of Macleod's
country) became the property of a Campbell; when a fox

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

had young ones in one of the turrets of the Castle, and particularly
when the Fairy enchanted banner should be for the last time exhibited,
then the glory of the Macleod family should depart; a great part of the
estate should be sold to others; so that a small 'curragh,' a boat,
would carry all gentlemen of the name of Macleod across Loch Dunvegan;
but that in times far distant another John Breac should arise, who
should redeem those estates, and raise the power and honours of the
house to a higher pitch than ever. Such in general terms was the
prophecy. And now as to the curious coincidence of its fulfilment.

"There was, at that time, at Dunvegan, an English smith, with whom I
became a favourite, and who told me in solemn secrecy, that the iron
chest which contained the 'fairy flag' was to be forced open next
morning; that he had arranged with Mr. Hector Macdonald Buchanan to be
there with his tools for that purpose.

"I was most anxious to be present, and I asked permission to that effect
of Mr. Buchanan (Macleod's man of business), who granted me leave on
condition that I should not inform anyone of the name of Macleod that
such was intended, and should keep it a profound secret from the chief.
This I promised and most faithfully acted on. Next morning we proceeded
to the chamber in the East Turret, where was the iron chest that
contained the famous flag, about which there is an interesting
tradition.

"With great violence the smith tore open the lid of this iron chest;
but, in doing so, a key was found under part of the covering, which
would have opened the chest, had it been found in time. There was an
inner case, in which was found the flag, enclosed in a wooden box of
strongly-scented wood. The flag consisted of a square piece of very rich
silk, with crosses wrought with gold thread, and several

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

elf-spots stitched with great care on different parts of it.

"On this occasion, the melancholy news of the death of the young and
promising heir of Macleod reached the Castle. 'Norman, the third
Norman,' was a lieutenant of H.M.S., the 'Queen Charlotte,' which was
blown up at sea, and he and the rest perished. At the same time, the
rocks called 'Macleod's Maidens' were sold, in the course of that very
week, to Angus Campbell of Ensay, and they are still in possession of
his grandson. A fox in possession of a Lieutenant Maclean, residing in
the West Turret of the Castle, had young ones, which I handled, and thus
all that was said in the prophecy alluded to was so far-fulfilled,
although I am glad the family of my chief still enjoy their ancestral
possessions, and the worst part of the prophecy accordingly remains
unverified. I merely state the facts of the case as they occurred,
without expressing any opinion whatever as to the nature of these
traditionary legends with which they were connected."

The estates are still, we are glad to say, in possession of the ancient
family of Macleod, and the present chief is rapidly improving the
prospects of his house. The probabilities are therefore at present
against our prophet. The hold of the Macleods on their estates is
getting stronger instead of weaker, and the John Breac who is to be the
future deliverer has not only not yet appeared, but the undesirable
position of affairs requiring his services is yet, we hope, in the
distant future.

The Seer predicted that "when the big-thumbed Sheriff-Officer and the
blind \[man\] of the twenty-four fingers shall be together in Barra,
Macneil of Barra may be making ready for the flitting" (Nuair a bhitheas
maor nan ordagan mora agus dall nan ceithir-meoraibh-fichead comhla ann
am

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Barraidh, faodaidh
MacNeill Bharraidh ’bhi deanamh deiseil na h-imirich.) This prediction,
which was known in Barra for generations, has been most literally
fulfilled. On a certain occasion, "the blind of the twenty-four
fingers," so called from having six fingers on each hand, and six toes
on each foot, left Benbecula on a tour, to collect alms in South Uist.
Being successful there, he decided upon visiting Barra before returning
home. Arriving at the Ferry--the isthmus which separates South Uist from
Barra,--he met "Maor nan Ordagan mora," and they crossed the kyle in the
same boat. It was afterwards found that the officer was actually on his
way to serve a summons of ejectment on the laird of Barra; and poor
Macneil not only had to make ready for, but had indeed to make the
flitting. The man who had acted as guide to the blind on the occasion
is, we are informed, still living and in excellent health, though
considerably over eighty years of age.

The following is said to have been fulfilled by the conduct of the Duke
of Cumberland at and after the battle of Culloden. The Seer was, on one
occasion, passing Millburn, on his way from Inverness to Petty, and
noticing the old mill, which was a very primitive building, thatched
with divots, he said:--"The day will come when thy wheel shall be turned
for three successive days by water red with human blood; for on the
banks of thy lade a fierce battle shall be fought, at which much blood
shall be spilt". Some say that this is as yet unfulfilled; and it has
been suggested that the battle may yet be fought in connection with the
new Barracks now building at the Hut of Health.

Coinneach also prophesied remarkable things regarding the Mackenzies of
Fairburn and Fairburn Tower. "The day will come when the Mackenzies of
Fairburn shall lose their entire possessions, and that branch of the
clan shall

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

disappear almost to a man from the face of the earth. Their Castle shall
become uninhabited, desolate, and forsaken, and a cow shall give birth
to a calf in the uppermost chamber in Fairburn Tower." The first part of
this prophecy has only too literally come to pass; and within the memory
of hundreds now living, and who knew Coinneach's prophecy years before
it was fulfilled, the latter part--that referring to the cow calving in
the uppermost chamber--has also been undoubtedly realised. We are
personally acquainted with people whose veracity is beyond question, who
knew the prophecy, and who actually took the trouble at the time to go
all the way from Inverness to see the cow-mother and her offspring in
the Tower, before they were taken down. Mr. Maclennan supplies the
following version:--Coinneach said, addressing a large concourse of
people--"Strange as it may appear to all those who may hear me this day,
yet what I am about to tell you is true and will come to pass at the
appointed time. The day will come when a cow shall give birth to a calf
in the uppermost chamber (seomar uachdarach) of Fairburn Castle. The
child now unborn will see it."

When the Seer uttered this prediction, the Castle of Fairburn was in the
possession of, and occupied by, a very rich and powerful chieftain, to
whom homage was paid by many of the neighbouring lairds. Its halls rang
loud with sounds of music and of mirth, and happiness reigned within its
portals. On its winding stone stairs trod and passed carelessly to and
fro pages and liveried servants in their wigs and golden trimmings.
Nothing in the world was more unlikely to happen, to all appearance,
than what the Seer predicted, and Coinneach was universally ridiculed
for having given utterance to what was apparently so nonsensical; but
this abuse and ridicule the Seer bore with the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

patient self-satisfied air of one who was fully convinced of the truth
of what he uttered. Years passed by, but no sign of the fulfilment of
the prophecy. The Seer, the Laird of Fairburn, and the whole of that
generation were gathered to their fathers, and still no signs of the
curious prediction being realised. The Laird of Fairburn's immediate
successors also followed their predecessors, and the Seer, to all
appearance, was fast losing his reputation as a prophet. The tower was
latterly left uninhabited, and it soon fell into a dilapidated state of
repair--its doors decayed and fell away from their hinges, one by one,
until at last there was no door on the main stair from the floor to the
roof. Some years after, and not long ago, the Fairburn tenant-farmer
stored away some straw in the uppermost chamber of the tower; in the
process, some of the straw dropped, and was left strewn on the
staircase. One of his cows on a certain day chanced to find her way to
the main door of the tower, and finding it open, began to pick up the
straw scattered along the stair. The animal proceeded thus, till she had
actually arrived at the uppermost chamber, whence, being heavy in calf,
she was unable to descend. She was consequently left in the tower until
she gave birth to a fine healthy calf. They were allowed to remain there
for several days, where many went to see them, after which the cow and
her progeny were brought down; and Coinneach Odhar's prophecy was thus
fulfilled to the letter.

"The day will come when the Lewsmen shall go forth with their hosts to
battle, but they will be turned back by the jaw-bone of an animal
smaller than an ass," was a prediction accounted ridiculous and quite
incomprehensible until it was fulfilled in a remarkable but very simple
manner. Seaforth and the leading men of the Clan, as is well known, were
"out in the ’15 and ’19," and had their estates forfeited;

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

and it was only a few years before the ’45 that their lands were again
restored to Seaforth, and to Mackenzie, 11th Baron of Hilton. The Rev.
Colin Mackenzie, a brother of Hilton, minister of Fodderty and Laird of
Glack, in Aberdeenshire, was the first in the neighbourhood of Brahan
who received information of Prince Charlie's landing in 1745. Seaforth
had still a warm feeling for the Prince. His reverend friend, though a
thorough Jacobite himself, was an intimate friend of Lord President
Forbes, with whom he kept up a regular correspondence. He decided, no
doubt mainly through his influence, to remain neutral himself, and
fearing that his friend of Brahan might be led to join the Prince, he
instantly, on receipt of the news, started for Brahan Castle. Although
it was very late at night when he received the information, he crossed
Knockfarrel, entered Seaforth's bedroom by the window--for he had
already gone to rest for the night--and without awakening his lady,
informed him of the landing of Charles. They decided upon getting out of
the way, and both immediately disappeared. Seaforth was well known to
have had previous correspondence with the Prince, and to have sent
private orders to the Lews to have his men there in readiness; and
Fodderty impressed upon him the prudence of getting out of sight
altogether in the meantime. They started through the mountains in the
direction of Poolewe, and some time afterwards, when there together in
concealment near the shore, they saw two ships entering the bay, having
on board a large number of armed men, whom they at once recognised as
Seaforth's followers from the Lews, raised and commanded by Captain
Colin Mackenzie, the great-grandfather of Major Thomas Mackenzie of the
78th Highlanders. Lord Seaforth had just been making a repast of a
sheep's head, when he espied his retainers, and approaching the ships
with the sheep's jawbone

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

in his hand, he waved it towards them, and ordered them to return to
their homes at once, which command they obeyed by making at once for
Stornoway; and thus was fulfilled Coinneach Odhar's apparently ludicrous
prediction, that the brave Lewsmen would be turned back from battle with
the jaw-bone of an animal smaller than an ass.

Mr. Maclennan supplies us also with the following:--"In the parish of
Avoch is a well of beautiful clear water, out of which the Brahan Seer,
upon one occasion, took a refreshing draught. So pleased was he with the
water, that he looked at his Blue Stone, and said--' Whoever he be that
drinketh of thy water henceforth, if suffering from any disease, shall,
by placing two pieces of straw or wood on thy surface, ascertain whether
he will recover or not. If he is to recover, the straws will whirl round
in opposite directions; if he is to die soon, they will remain
stationary'. The writer (continues Mr. Maclennan) knew people who went
to the well and made the experiment. He was himself once unwell, and
supposed to be at the point of death; he got of the water of the well,
and he still lives. Whether it did him good or not, it is impossible to
say, but this he does know, that the water pleased him uncommonly well."

With reference to Lady Hill, in the same parish, the Seer said--"Thy
name has gone far and wide; but though thy owners were brave on the
field of battle, they never decked thy brow. The day will come, however,
when a white collar shall be put upon thee. The child that is unborn
shall see it, but I shall not." This prediction has been fulfilled a few
years ago, by the construction of a fine drive right round the hill.

The Seer said, speaking of Beauly--"The day will come, however distant,
when 'Cnoc na Rath' will be in the centre of the village". It certainly
would appear incredible, and

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

even absurd, to suggest such a thing in Coinneach's day, for the
"village" then stood at a place south of the present railway station,
called, in Gaelic, "Bealaidh-Achadh," or the Broom field, quite a mile
from Cnoc na Rath. The prophecy has to some extent been fulfilled, for
the last erection at Beauly--the new public school--is within a few
yards of the Cnoc; and the increasing enterprise of the inhabitants is
rapidly aiding, and, indeed, will soon secure, the absolute realisation
of the Seer's prediction. In connection with this prophecy we think that
we have discovered a Celtic origin for the term Beauly. It is generally
supposed to have been derived from the French word "Beaulieu". The
village being originally at "Bealaidh-Achadh," and so called when the
present Beauly was nowhere, what can be more natural than the
supposition that the inhabitants carried the original name of their
original village along with them, and now present us with the Gaelic
"Bealaidh," anglified into Beauly. This is not such a fine theory as the
French one, but it is more likely to be the true one, and is more
satisfactory to the student of Gaelic topography.

We have several versions of the prophecy regarding the carrying away of
the Stone Bridge across the River Ness, which stood near the place where
the present Suspension Bridge stands. Mr. Macintyre supplies the
following, and Mr. Maclennan's version is very much the same:--"He
foretold that the Ness bridge would be swept away by a great flood,
while crowded with people, and while a man riding a white horse and a
woman 'enciente' were crossing it. Either the prophet's second-sight
failed him on the occasion, or tradition has not preserved the correct
version of the prediction, for it is well known that no human being was
carried away by the bridge when it was swept away by the extraordinary
flood of 1849."

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

As a matter of fact, there was no man riding a white horse on the bridge
at the time, but a man--Matthew Campbell--and a woman were crossing it,
the arches tumbling one by one at their heels as they flew across; but
they managed to reach the western shore in safety, just as the last arch
was crumbling under their feet. Campbell, who was behind, coming up to
the woman, caught her in his arms, and with a desperate bound cleared
the crumbling structure.

The Seer also foretold that before the latter prediction was fulfilled
"people shall pick gooseberries from a bush growing on the stone ledge
of one of the arches". There are many now living who remember this
gooseberry bush, and who have seen it in bloom and blossom, and with
fruit upon it. It grew on the south side of the bridge, on the third or
fourth pier, and near the iron grating which supplied a dismal light to
the dungeon which in those days was the Inverness prison. Maclean, "A
Nonagenarian," writing forty years ago, says nothing of the bush, but,
while writing of the predicted fall of the bridge, states, with regard
to it, that "an old tradition or prophecy is, that many lives will be
lost at its fall, and that this shall take place when there are seven
females on the bridge, in a state poetically described as that 'in which
ladies wish to be who love their lords'." This was written, as will be
seen by comparing dates, several years before the bridge was carried
away in 1849, showing unmistakably that the prophecy was not concocted
after the event.

"The natural arch, or 'Clach tholl,' near Storehead in Assynt, will fall
with a crash so loud as to cause the laird of Leadmore's cattle, twenty
miles away, to break their tethers." This was fulfilled in 1841,
Leadmore's cattle having one day strayed from home to within a few
hundred

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

yards of the arch, when it fell with such a crash as to send them home
in a frantic fright, tearing' everything before them. Hugh Miller refers
to this prediction, as also to several others, in the work already
alluded to--"Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland," pp. 161, 162,
163.

About sixteen years ago, there lived in the village of "Baile Mhuilinn,"
in the West of Sutherlandshire, an old woman of about 95 years of age,
known as Baraball n’ic Coinnich (Annabella Mackenzie). From her
position, history, and various personal peculiarities, it was
universally believed in the district that she was no other than the
Baraball n’ic Coinnich of whom the Brahan Seer predicted that she would
die of the measles. She had, however, arrived at such an advanced age,
without any appearance or likelihood of her ever having that disease,
that the prophet was rapidly losing credit in the district. About this
time the measles had just gone the round of the place, and had made
considerable havoc among old and young; but when the district was, so to
speak, convalescent, the measles paid Baraball a visit, and actually
carried her away, when within a few years of five score, leaving no
doubt whatever in the minds of the people that she had died as foretold
centuries before by the famous Coinneach Odhar.

The Seer, one day, pointing to the now celebrated Strathpeffer mineral
wells, said: "Uninviting and disagreeable as it now is, with its thick
crusted surface and unpleasant smell, the day will come when it shall be
under lock and key, and crowds of pleasure and health seekers shall be
seen thronging its portals, in their eagerness to get a draught of its
waters."

Regarding the "land-grasping" Urquharts of Cromarty he predicted "that,
extensive though their possessions in the Black Isle now are, the day
will come--and it is close

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

at hand--when they will not own twenty acres in the district." This,
like many of his other predictions, literally came to pass, although
nothing could then have been more unlikely; for, at the time, the
Urquharts possessed the estates of Kinbeachie, Braelangwell, Newhall,
and Monteagle, but at this moment their only possession in the Black
Isle is a small piece of Braelangwell.

That "the day will come when fire and water shall run in streams through
all the streets and lanes of Inverness," was a prediction, the
fulfilment of which was quite incomprehensible, until the introduction
of gas and water through pipes into every corner of the town.

"The day will come when long strings of carriages without horses shall
run between Dingwall and Inverness, and more wonderful still, between
Dingwall and the Isle of Skye." It is hardly necessary to point out that
this refers to the railway carriages now running in those districts.

That "a bald black girl will be born at the back of the Church of
Gairloch" (Beirear nighean mhaol dubh air cùl Eaglais Ghearrloch), has
been fulfilled. During one of the usual large gatherings at the
Sacramental Communion a well-known young woman was taken in labour, and
before she could be removed she gave birth to the "nighean mhaol dubh,"
whose descendants are well known and pointed out in the district to this
day as the fulfilment of Coinneach's prophecy.

That "a white cow will give birth to a calf in the garden behind
Gairloch House," has taken place within the memory of people still
living; that, in Fowerdale, "a black hornless cow (Bo mhaol dubh) will
give birth to a calf with two heads," happened within our own
recollection. These predictions were well known to people before they
came to pass.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

The following are evidently fragments regarding the Lovat Estates. He
said:--

Thig fear tagair bho dheas,  
Mar eun bho phreas.  
Fasaidh a mar luibh,  
’S sgaoilidh e mar shiol,  
’S cuiridh e teine ri Ardrois.

(A Claimant will come from the South  
Like a bird from a bush;  
He will grow like an herb;  
He will spread like seed,  
And set fire to Ardross.) <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2)

"Mhac Shimidh ball-dubh, a dh‘fhagus an oighreachd gun an t-oighre
dligheach." (Mac Shimidh (Lovat), the black-spotted, who will leave the
Estate without the rightful heir.) "An Sisealach claon ruadh, a
dh’fhagus an oighreachd gun an t-oighre dligheach." (Chisholm, the
squint-eyed, who will leave the estate without the rightful heir.) "An
tighearna stòrach a dh’fhagus oighreachd Ghearrloch gun an t-oighre
dligheach." (The buck-toothed laird who will leave the estate of
Gairloch without the rightful heir), are also fragments.

We do not know whether there has been any Lovat or Chisholm with the
peculiar personal characteristics mentioned by the Seer, <span
id="fr_3"></span>[†](#fn_3) and shall be glad to receive information

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

on the point, as well as a fuller and more particular version of the
prophecy. We are aware, however, that Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch
was buck-toothed, and that he was always known among his tenants in the
west, as "An tighearna stòrach". We heard old people maintaining that
Coinneach was correct even in this instance, and that his prediction has
been actually fulfilled; but, at present, we abstain from going into
that part of this family history which would throw light on the subject.
A gentleman is trying to assert rights to the Lovat estates at the
present moment.

Before proceeding to give such of the prophecies regarding the family of
Seaforth as have been so literally fulfilled in the later annals of that
once great and powerful house--the history of the family being so
intimately interwoven with, and being itself really the fulfilment of
the Seer's predictions--it may interest the reader to have a cursory
glance at it from the earliest period in which the family appears in
history.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[59:†](pbs07.htm#fr_3) Since the above was in
type, we came across the following in Anderson's History of the Family
of Fraser, p. 114:--"Hugh, son of the 10th Lord Lovat, was born on the
28th September, 1666. From a large black spot on his upper lip he was
familiarly called, Mac Shimidh Ball-dubh, *i.e.*, black-spotted Simpson
or Lovat. Three chieftains were distinguished at this time by similar
deformities--(1) Mac Coinnich Glùn-dubh, i.e., black-kneed Mackenzie;
(2) Macintoshich Ciaon, *i.e.*, squint-eyed MacKintosh; (g) Sisealach
Càm, crooked or one-eyed Chisholm."
