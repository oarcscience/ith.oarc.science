<p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></A></p> <h1 align="CENTER">XVIII.</h1> <h3 align="CENTER" align="center">THE ONLY SON OF AOIFE</h3> 
<p>THE time Cuchulain came back from Alban, after he had learned the use of arms under Scathach, he left Aoife, the queen he had overcome in battle, with child.</p> 
<p>And when he was leaving her, he told her what name to give the child, and he gave her a gold ring, and bade her keep it safe till the child grew to be a lad, and till his thumb would fill it; and he bade her to give it to him then, and to send him<i> </i>to Ireland, and he would know he was his son by that token. She promised to do so, and with that Cuchulain went back to Ireland.</p> 
<p>It was not long after the child was born, word came to Aoife that Cuchulain had taken Emer to be his wife in Ireland. When she heard that, great jealousy came on her, and great anger, and her love for Cuchulain was turned to hatred; and she remembered her three champions that he had killed, and how he had overcome herself, and she determined in her mind that when her son would come to have the strength of a man, she would get her revenge through him. She told Conlaoch her son nothing of this, but brought him up like any king's son; and when he was come to sensible years, she put him under the teaching of Scathach, to be taught the use of arms and the art of war. He turned out as apt a scholar as his father, and it was not long before he had learnt all Scathach had to teach.</p> 
<p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></A></p> 
<p>Then Aoife gave him the arms of a champion, and bade him go to Ireland, but first she laid three commands on him: the first never to give way to any living person, but to die sooner than be made turn back; the second, not to refuse a challenge from the greatest champion alive, but to fight him at all risks, even if he was sure to lose his life; the third, not to tell his name on any account, though he might be threatened with death for hiding it. She put him under <i>geasa, </i>that is, under bonds, not to do these things.</p> 
<p>Then the young man, Conlaoch, set out, and it was not long before his ship brought him to Ireland, and the place he landed at was Baile's Strand, near Dundealgan.</p> 
<p>It chanced that at that time Conchubar, the High King, was holding court there, for it was a convenient gathering-place for his chief men, and they were settling some business that belonged to the government of that district.</p> 
<p>When word was brought to Conchubar that there was a ship come to the strand, and a young lad in it armed as if for fighting, and armed men with him, he sent one of the chief men of his household to ask his name, and on what business he was come.</p> 
<p>The messenger's name was Cuinaire, and he went down to the strand, and when he saw the young man he said: "A welcome to you, young hero from the east, with the merry face. It is likely, seeing you come armed as if for fighting, you are gone astray on your journey; but as you are come to Ireland, tell me your name and what your deeds have been, and your victories in the eastern bounds of the world."</p> 
<p>"As to my name," said Conlaoch, "it is of no great account; but whatever it is, I am under bonds not to tell it to the stoutest man living."</p> 
<p>"It is best for you to tell it at the king's desire," said</p> 
<p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Cuinaire, "before you get your death through refusing it, as many a champion from Alban and from Britain has done before now." "If that is the order you put on us when we land here, it is I will break it," said Conlaoch, "and no one will obey it any longer from this out."</p> 
<p>So Cuinaire went back and told the king what the young lad had said. Then Conchubar said to his people: 'Who will go out into the field, and drag the name and the story out of this young man?" "I will go," said Conall, for his hand was never slow in fighting. And he went out, and found the lad angry and destroying, handling his arms, and they attacked one another with a great noise of swords and shouts, and they were gripped together, and fought for a while, and then Conall was overcome, and the great name and the praise that was on Conall, it was on the head of Conlaoch it was now.</p> 
<p>Word was sent then to where Cuchulain was, in pleasant, bright-faced Dundealgan. And the messenger told him the whole story, and he said: "Conall is lying humbled, and it is slow the help is in coming; it is a welcome there would be before the Hound."</p> 
<p>Cuchulain rose up then and went to where Conlaoch was, and he still handling his arms. And Cuchulain asked him his name and said: "It would be well for you, young hero of unknown name, to loosen yourself from this knot, and not to bring down my hand upon you, for it will be hard for you to escape death." But Conlaoch said: "If I put you down in the fight, the way I put down your comrade, there will be a great name on me; but if I draw back now, there will be mockery on me, and it will be said I was afraid of the fight. I will never give in to any man to tell the name, or to give an account of myself. But if I was not held with a command," he said, "there is no man in the world I would</p> 
<p><a name="page_316"><font size="1" color="green">p. 316</font></A></p> 
<p>sooner give it to than to yourself, since I saw your face. But do not think, brave champion of Ireland, that I will let you take away the fame I have won, for nothing."</p> 
<p>With that they fought together, and it is seldom such a battle was seen, and all wondered that the young lad could stand so well against Cuchulain.</p> 
<p>So they fought a long while, neither getting the better of the other, but at last Cuchulain was charged so hotly by the lad that he was forced to give way, and although he had fought so many good fights, and killed so many great champions, and understood the use of arms better than any man living, he was pressed very hard.</p> 
<p>And he called for the Gae Bulg, and his anger came on him, and the flames of the hero-light began to shine about his head, and by that sign Conlaoch knew him to be Cuchulain, his father. And just at that time he was aiming his spear at him, and when he knew it was Cuchulain, he threw his spear crooked that it might pass beside him. But Cuchulain threw his spear, the Gae Bulg, at him with all his might, and it struck the lad in the side and went into his body, so that he fell to the ground.</p> 
<p>And Cuchulain said: "Now, boy, tell your name and what you are, for it is short your life will be, for you will not live after that wound."</p> 
<p>And Conlaoch showed the ring that was on his hand, and he said: "Come here where I am lying on the field, let my men from the east come round me. I am suffering for revenge. I am Conlaoch, son of the Hound, heir of dear Dundealgan; I was bound to this secret in Dun Scathach, the secret in which I have found my grief."</p> 
<p>And Cuchulain said: "It is a pity your mother not to be here to see you brought down. She might have stretched out her hand to stop the spear that wounded</p> 
<p><a name="page_317"><font size="1" color="green">p. 317</font></A></p> 
<p>you." And Conlaoch said: "My curse be on my mother, for it was she put me under bonds; it was she sent me here to try my strength against yours." And Cuchulain said: "My curse be on your mother, the woman that is full of treachery; it is through her harmful thoughts these tears have been brought on us." And Conlaoch said: "My name was never forced from my mouth till now; I never gave an account of myself to any man under the sun. But, O Cuchulain of the sharp sword, it was a pity you not to know me the time I threw the slanting spear behind you in the fight."</p> 
<p>And then the sorrow of death came upon Conlaoch, and Cuchulain took his sword and put it through him, sooner than leave him in the pain and the punishment he was in.</p> 
<p>And then great trouble and anguish came on Cuchulain, and he made this complaint:</p> 
<p>"It is a pity it is, O son of Aoife, that ever you came into the province of Ulster, that you ever met with the Hound of Cuailgne.</p> 
<p>"If I and my fair Conlaoch were doing feats of war on the one side, the men of Ireland from sea to sea would not be equal to us together. It is no wonder I to be under grief when I see the shield and the arms of Conlaoch. A pity it is there is no one at all, a pity there are not hundreds of men on whom I could get satisfaction for his death.</p> 
<p>"If it was the king himself had hurt your fair body, it is I would have shortened his days.</p> 
<p>"It is well for the House of the Red Branch, and for the heads of its fair army of heroes, it was not they that killed my only son.</p> 
<p>"It is well for Laegaire of Victories it is not from him you got your heavy pain.</p> 
<p>"It is well for the heroes of Conall they did not join in the killing of you; it is well that travelling across</p> 
<p><a name="page_318"><font size="1" color="green">p. 318</font></A></p> 
<p>the plain of Macha they did not fall in with me after such a fight.</p> 
<p>"It is well for the tall, well-shaped Forbuide; well for Dubthach, your Black Beetle of Ulster.</p> 
<p>"It is well for you, Cormac Conloingeas, your share of arms gave no help, that it is not from your weapons he got his wound, the hard-skinned shield or the blade.</p> 
<p>"It is a pity it was not one on the plains of Munster, or in Leinster of the sharp blades, or at Cruachan of the rough fighters, that struck down my comely Conlaoch.</p> 
<p>"It is a pity it was not in the country of the Cruithne, of the fierce Fians, you fell in a heavy quarrel, or in the country of the Greeks, or in some other place of the world, you died, and I could avenge you.</p> 
<p>"Or in Spain, or in Sorcha, or in the country of the Saxons of the free armies; there would not then be this death in my heart.</p> 
<p>"It is very well for the men of Alban it was not they that destroyed your fame; and it is well for the men of the Gall.</p> 
<p>"Och! It is bad that it happened; my grief! it is on me is the misfortune, O Conlaoch of the Red Spear, I myself to have spilled your blood.</p> 
<p>"I to be under defeat, without strength. It is a pity Aoife never taught you to know the power of my strength in the fight.</p> 
<p>"It is no wonder I to be blinded after such a fight and such a defeat.</p> 
<p>"It is no wonder I to be tired out, and without the sons of Usnach beside me.</p> 
<p>"Without a son, without a brother, with none to come after me; without Conlaoch, without a name to keep my strength.</p> 
<p>"To be without Naoise, without Ainnle, without Ardan; is it not with me is my fill of trouble?</p> 
<p><a name="page_319"><font size="1" color="green">p. 319</font></A></p> 
<p>"I am the father that killed his son, the fine green branch; there is no hand or shelter to help me.</p> 
<p>"I am a raven that has no home; I am a boat going from wave to wave; I am a ship that has lost its rudder; I am the apple left on the tree; it is little I thought of falling from it; grief and sorrow will be with me from this time."</p> 
<p>Then Cuchulain stood up and faced all the men of Ulster. "There is trouble on Cuchulain," said Conchubar; "he is after killing his own son, and if I and all my men were to go against him, by the end of the day he would destroy every man of us. Go now," he said to Cathbad, the Druid, "and bind him to go down to Baile's Strand, and to give three days fighting against the waves of the sea, rather than to kill us all."</p> 
<p>So Cathbad put an enchantment on him, and bound him to go down. And when he came to the strand, there was a great white stone before him, and he took his sword in his right hand, and he said: "If I had the head of the woman that sent her son to his death, I would split it as I split this stone." And he made four quarters of the stone.</p> 
<p>Then he fought with the waves three days and three nights, till he fell from hunger and weakness, so that some men said he got his death there. But it was not there he got his death, but on the plain of Muirthemne.</p>
