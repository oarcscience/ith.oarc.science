<P>I. I WILL offer a prayer to the Trinity,<BR>
May the Eternal grant me to praise thee!<BR>
In the present course, dangerous<BR>
Our work; destruction is a slight impulse of wrath.<BR>
They reckon of the saints a tribe,<BR>
King of heaven, may I be eloquent about thee!<BR>
Before the separation of my soul from my flesh.<BR>
Thou particularly knowest in what is my sin.</P>
<P>II. Thy entreaty before the paternal governance<BR>
May there be to me from the Trinity mercy!<BR>
I adore, I earnestly long for the elements of blood,<BR>
Nine degrees of the mystic troops of heaven,<BR>
And the tenth, saints a preparation of sevens.<BR>
Heroic numberer of languages,<BR>
A conspicuous sea-shoal of goodly increase.<BR>
A number that God will watch with extreme love.<BR>
In heaven, in earth, at the end,<BR>
In straits, in expanse, in form,<BR>
In body, in soul, in habit,<BR>
Prudence (is) far from the presence of kings.<BR>
j adore thee, Ruler of the land of peace.<BR>
Let my soul be in a condition of life;<BR>
For ever in (his) court;<BR>
A servant of heaven (to be), he will not refuse me.</P>
<P>III. Apostles and martyrs,<BR>
Youths, supplicants of glory, <A NAME="page_546"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 546</FONT></A><BR>
And Solomon (that) served God:<BR>
Of pure speech, of pure walk, thy quality<BR>
And a verdant gift will come to me.<BR>
As long as I keep my faculties.<BR>
Numbers there were clean and holy,<BR>
Steps, golden columns of the church.<BR>
And many writers have declared,<BR>
Skilled in the fully-holy books,<BR>
For the multitude discarded anxiety.<BR>
May my soul be defended from it!</P>
<P>IV. A number there were in the inconcurrence<BR>
Of Uffern, a cold refuge;<BR>
During the five ages of the world,<BR>
Until when Christ loosened the bondage.<BR>
From the deep shore of the abyss of evil<BR>
Many God brought through protection,<BR>
Two thousand sons of the children of Ilia.<BR>

The tears of Rachel, it was seen that a plague<BR>
Had come to Jerusalem.</P>

The fame far of the castle of Maria.<BR>
That broke not again Syloe<BR>

Amanion amabute,<BR>
And the valleys of Bersabe.<BR>
And before the Christian religion the men of Cartasine,<BR>
And the severely just ones of Retunde,<BR>
The languages, Greek and Hebrew,<BR>
And Latin, men of gleaming pervasion.</P>
<P>VIII. The number of saints in scores,<BR>
Valiant men, golden their party.<BR>
Before kings a career of praise,<BR>
Warriors, no one was before them in demanding.<BR>
In straits, in expanse, in every need,<BR>
May they be a city to our body and our soul!</P>
<P>IX. The number of the saints of Sicomorialis,<BR>
And isle of Deffrobani.<BR>
And the holy multitude that blessed<BR>
Water, wine, hostile men destroyed.<BR>
And entreating his exalted weight,<BR>
Under the stars, saints he planted.</P>
<P>X. The number of the saints that the upper region holds,<BR>
Effectus re inferior<BR>

And the green isle, the boundary of the sea.</P>
<P>XI. The number of the saints of the Isle of Prydein,<BR>
And Iwerdon, a gentle portion.<BR>
Multitudes, of beautiful works,<BR>
Believed, served with us.</P>
<P>XII. The number of saints, a synod without desire,<BR>
From God the divine prophesy.<BR>
In every tongue they compose,<BR>
About the earth they were,<BR>
And so many wisely prophesied<BR>
Christ, and before he was, they were.</P>

And the concord of the nation of Judah.<BR>
Languages of Greek and Hebrew,<BR>
And Latin, men of gleaming pervasion.</P>
<P>XIV. Seven scores, seven scores, seven hundreds of saints,<BR>
And seven thousands and seven ten scores,<BR>
November a number implored,<BR>
Through martyrs good they came.<BR>
Fifteen scores of saints there were<BR>
And three thousand children of Morialis.<BR>
In these Decembers above relatives<BR>
Over the head of Jesus utter sighs.</P>
<P>XV. Twelve thousand in the convention<BR>
Believed through the voice of John.<BR>
They worship, they deserve a portion,<BR>
In heaven they will not be angry.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_549"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 549</FONT></A></P>
<P>XVI. Nine thousand saints received<BR>
Baptism, and religion, and confession.<BR>
Notwithstanding death the punishment of people (is) heat,<BR>

If the Lord hath satisfied us,<BR>
Through the head of Peter was made the destitute.</P>
<P>XVII. Qui venerunt angli<BR>
In natale Domini<BR>
Media nocte in laudem<BR>
Cum pastoribus in Bethleem.<BR>
Nivem angli de celo<BR>
Cum Michaele archanglo<BR>
Qui precedunt precelio<BR>
Erga animas in mundo<BR>
Am nivem&nbsp;nivem angeli.<BR>
Precedunt confirmati<BR>
Vnistrati baptizati<BR>
Usque in them judicii.<BR>
Quando fuit Christus crucifixus ut sibi<BR>
Ipsi placuisset venissent ibi in auxilium<BR>
Plusquam duodecim legiones angelorum.<BR>
Toto orbe terrarum.<BR>
Jesus Christus videntem in agonia in mundo.<BR>
Ut sint nostri auxilium<BR>
Duodecim milia miliantem<BR>
Ante tribunal stantem.<BR>
Qui laudantie laudantium<BR>
Tues mores rex regum.</P>
<P>XVIII. The number that have been, and will be,<BR>
Above heaven, below heaven, how many there are.<BR>
And as many as have believed in revelation, <A NAME="page_550"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 550</FONT></A><BR>
Believed through the will of the Lord.<BR>
As many as are on wrath through the circles,<BR>
Have mercy, God, on thy kindred.<BR>
May I be meek, the turbulent ruler,<BR>
May I not endure, before I am without motion.<BR>
Grievously complaineth every lost one,<BR>
Hastily, claimeth every needy one.<BR>
An exceedingly displeased mind will not run<BR>
From (its) present course, when I am angry.<BR>
I will declare when I am in the gravel,<BR>
From the maintenance of gifts,<BR>
From being numbered, from going to be a martyr<BR>
In the reckoning of Saint Segerno.<BR>
From a word when sin may be to me,<BR>
Let there be no sigh from those that hear me.</P>
