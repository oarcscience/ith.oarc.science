<P>IN the name of the God of Trinity, of knowing charity,<BR>
A tribe numerous, ungentle their arrogance,<BR>
Have overrun Prydain, chief of isles.<BR>
Men of the land of Asia, and land of Gafis.<BR>
A people of perfect prudence, their country is not known,<BR>
Their mother country; they deviated on account of the sea.<BR>
Flowing their coats; who is like them?<BR>
With discretion let the work of foes be brought about,<BR>
Europin, Arafin, Arafanis.<BR>
10 The Christian unmindful was impelled certainly<BR>
Before the reconciliation of Llud and Llevelys..<BR>
The possessor of the fair isle trembled<BR>
Before the chief from Rome, of splendid terror.<BR>
Neither hesitating nor crafty the king, fluent his speech.<BR>
Who has seen what I have seen of the strange speech?<BR>
There were formed a square mast, the clarions of journey,<BR>
Before the presence of Roman leader there is conflagration. <A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A><BR>
The son of Gradd, of fluent speech, retaliated,<BR>
Cymry burning: war on slaves.<BR>
20 I will consider, I will deliberate who caused them to go.<BR>
The Brythonic energy arose.</P>
