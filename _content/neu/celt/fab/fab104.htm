<P>MEDITATING were my thoughts<BR>
On the vain poetry of the bards of Brython.<BR>
Making the best of themselves in the chief convention.<BR>
Enough, the care of the smith's sledge-hammer.<BR>
I am in want of a stick, straitened in song,<BR>
The fold of the bards, who knows it not?<BR>
Fifteen thousand over it<BR>
Adjusting it.<BR>
I am a harmonious one; I am a clear singer.<BR>
10 I am steel; I am a druid.<BR>
I am an artificer; I am a scientific one.<BR>
I am a serpent; I am love; I will indulge in feasting<BR>
I am not a confused bard drivelling, <A NAME="page_524"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 524</FONT></A><BR>
When songsters sing a song by memory,<BR>
They will not make wonderful cries;<BR>
May I be receiving them.<BR>
Like receiving clothes without a hand,<BR>
Like sinking in a lake without swimming,<BR>
The stream boldly rises tumultuously in degree.<BR>
20 High in the blood of sea-board towns.<BR>
The rock wave-surrounded, by great arrangement,<BR>
Will convey for us a defence, a protection from the enemy.<BR>
The rock of the chief proprietor, the head of tranquillity.<BR>
The intoxication of meads will cause us to speak.<BR>
I am a cell, I am a cleft, I am a restoration,<BR>
I am the depository of song; I am a literary man;<BR>
I love the high trees, that afford a protection above,<BR>
And a bard that composes, without earning anger;<BR>
I love not him that causes contention<BR>
30 He that speaks ill of the skilful shall not possess mead.<BR>
It is a fit time to go to the drinking,<BR>
With the skilful men, about art,<BR>
And a hundred knots, the custom of the country,<BR>
The shepherd of the districts, support of gates,<BR>
Like going without a foot to battle.<BR>
He would not journey without a foot.<BR>
He would not breed nuts without trees,<BR>
Like seeking for ants in the heath.<BR>
Like an instrument of foolish spoil,<BR>
40 Like the retinue of an army without a head,<BR>
Like feeding the unsheltered on lichen.<BR>
Like ridging furrows from the country<BR>
Like reaching the sky with a hook,<BR>
Like deprecating with the blood of thistles,<BR>
Like making light for the blind,<BR>
Like sharing clothes to the naked,<BR>
Like spreading buttermilk on the sands, <A NAME="page_525"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 525</FONT></A><BR>
Like feeding fish upon milk,<BR>
Like roofing a hall with leaves,<BR>
50 Like killing a tortoise with rods.<BR>
Like dissolving riches before a word.<BR>
I am a bard of the hall, I am a chick of the chair.<BR>
I will cause to loquacious bards a hindrance.<BR>
Before I am dragged to my harsh reward,<BR>
May we buy thee, that wilt protect us, thou son of Mary.</P>
