<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>IN the name of the Ruler of the high powers of heaven,<BR>
They sing of, they deplore the prince;<BR>
He rejected uniform ranks of the rulers,<BR>
Of the hosts of Run and Nudd and Nwython.<BR>
I will not praise contrary to the custom of the Bards of the Brython.<BR>
Wonderfully liberal of the knowledge of astrologers.<BR>
One station of the complete songster; excellent of song,<BR>
I ardently desire; I will sing to the Guledig,<BR>
In the country where he was trembling, <A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A><BR>
10 he will not cause me to be unable to form the lay.<BR>
It is difficult to utter odes;<BR>
That will not be deficient to the Guledig that does not refuse.<BR>
Of looking at a heavy ode of sovereignty<BR>
In his life will not come the advantage of the grave.<BR>
They will not be satisfied with the gratification of their lives.<BR>
Harder the torment of a liberal course,<BR>
A multitude present beyond Prydain.<BR>
Thy excessive care of the too sprightly is corrupted.<BR>
Let it be corrupted. He shall be cut to pieces, he shall be judged.<BR>
20 He will judge all, the supreme man.<BR>
With his will as a judge; and let him be benefited,<BR>
Not the man that claims the mortuary.<BR>
A youth violent that regrets the milky food,<BR>
Like the herald of Gwallawg guiding on.<BR>
Of a forbearing aspect is the countenance of Gwallawg.<BR>
He inquires of no one what he has done.<BR>
Is he not my chief? Is there not sold to you<BR>
Thick mead in the end of summer?<BR>
There will not increase save six.<BR>
30 Sweeter to thee is conversation from elders.<BR>
Talkative is the privileged orator<BR>
Of king s ill the luxuriant circle of the good mead.<BR>
Like the sun, the warm animator of summer, let him sound the greatest song.<BR>
I will sing the wise song, the song of the host of harmony.<BR>
They will be, thou wilt be a Druid in summer time, the aspect of the son<BR>
Of Lleenawg, with a flowing manly robe.<BR>
Light, a robe of heat; vapour of heat, heat of vapour.<BR>
Whilst it rose it was contained without disgrace. <A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A><BR>
A sword will destroy the swordsman's horse;<BR>
40 His host will not break me to theft,<BR>
The native country of a slave is not free to him,<BR>
They will perforate the fronts of shields before the fronts of horses.<BR>
From his steed of tumult, Morial shall appear before the host<BR>
Fiercely impassioned. They shall pledge the rich plains<BR>
From Caer Clud to Caer Caradawg,<BR>
The support of the land of Penprys and Gwallawg,<BR>
The king of the kings of tranquil aspect.</P>
