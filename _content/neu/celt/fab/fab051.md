### XXXVI.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXVIII.

IN the name of the Ruler of the high powers of heaven,  
They sing of, they deplore the prince;  
He rejected uniform ranks of the rulers,  
Of the hosts of Run and Nudd and Nwython.  
I will not praise contrary to the custom of the Bards of the Brython.  
Wonderfully liberal of the knowledge of astrologers.  
One station of the complete songster; excellent of song,  
I ardently desire; I will sing to the Guledig,  
In the country where he was trembling, <span id="page_339">p.
339</span>  
10 he will not cause me to be unable to form the lay.  
It is difficult to utter odes;  
That will not be deficient to the Guledig that does not refuse.  
Of looking at a heavy ode of sovereignty  
In his life will not come the advantage of the grave.  
They will not be satisfied with the gratification of their lives.  
Harder the torment of a liberal course,  
A multitude present beyond Prydain.  
Thy excessive care of the too sprightly is corrupted.  
Let it be corrupted. He shall be cut to pieces, he shall be judged.  
20 He will judge all, the supreme man.  
With his will as a judge; and let him be benefited,  
Not the man that claims the mortuary.  
A youth violent that regrets the milky food,  
Like the herald of Gwallawg guiding on.  
Of a forbearing aspect is the countenance of Gwallawg.  
He inquires of no one what he has done.  
Is he not my chief? Is there not sold to you  
Thick mead in the end of summer?  
There will not increase save six.  
30 Sweeter to thee is conversation from elders.  
Talkative is the privileged orator  
Of king s ill the luxuriant circle of the good mead.  
Like the sun, the warm animator of summer, let him sound the greatest
song.  
I will sing the wise song, the song of the host of harmony.  
They will be, thou wilt be a Druid in summer time, the aspect of the
son  
Of Lleenawg, with a flowing manly robe.  
Light, a robe of heat; vapour of heat, heat of vapour.  
Whilst it rose it was contained without disgrace. <span id="page_340">p.
340</span>  
A sword will destroy the swordsman's horse;  
40 His host will not break me to theft,  
The native country of a slave is not free to him,  
They will perforate the fronts of shields before the fronts of horses.  
From his steed of tumult, Morial shall appear before the host  
Fiercely impassioned. They shall pledge the rich plains  
From Caer Clud to Caer Caradawg,  
The support of the land of Penprys and Gwallawg,  
The king of the kings of tranquil aspect.
