<P>I. BLESSED is the birch in the valley of the Gwy,<BR>
Whose branches will fall off one by one, two by two,<BR>
It will remain when there will be a battle in Ardudwy, <A NAME="page_482"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 482</FONT></A><BR>
And the lowing together of cattle about the ford of Mochnwy,<BR>
And spears and shouting at Dyganwy,<BR>
And Edwin bearing sway in Mona,<BR>
And youths pale and light<BR>
In ruddy clothes commanding them.</P>
<P>II. Blessed is the birch in Pumlumon,<BR>
Which will see when the front of the stag shall be exalted,<BR>
And which will see the Franks clad in mail,<BR>
And about the hearth food for whelps,<BR>
And monks frequently riding on steeds.</P>
<P>III. Blessed is the birch in the heights of Dinwythwy,<BR>
Which will know when there shall be a battle in Ardudwy,<BR>
And spears uplifted around Edrywy,<BR>
And a bridge on the Taw, and another on the Tawy,<BR>
And another, on account of a misfortune, on the two banks of the Gwy,<BR>
And the artificer that will make it, let his name be Garwy;<BR>
And may the principal of Mona have dominion over it.<BR>
Women will be under the Gynt, and men in affliction.<BR>
Happier than I is he who will welcome<BR>
The time of Cadwaladyr: a song he may sing!</P>
