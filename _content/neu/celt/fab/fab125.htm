<P>1. ENTANGLING is the snare, clustered is the ash;<BR>
The ducks are in the pond; white breaks the wave;<BR>
More powerful than a hundred is the counsel of the heart.</P>
<P>II. Long the night, boisterous is the sea-shore;<BR>
Usual a tumult in a congregation;<BR>
The vicious will not agree with the good.</P>
<P>III. Long the night, boisterous is the mountain,<BR>
The wind whistles over the tops of trees;<BR>
Ill-nature will not deceive the discreet.</P>

<P>IV. The saplings of the green-topped birch<BR>
Will extricate my foot from the shackle;<BR>
Disclose not thy secret to a youth.</P>
<P>V. The saplings of oaks in the grove<BR>
Will extricate my foot from the chain;<BR>
Disclose no secret to a maid.</P>
<P>VI. The saplings of the leafy oaks<BR>
Will extricate my foot from the prison;<BR>
Divulge no secret to a babbler.</P>
<P>VII. The saplings of bramble have berries on them;<BR>
The thrush is on her nest;<BR>
And the liar will never be silent.</P>
<P>VIII. Rain without, the fern is drenched;<BR>
White the gravel of the sea; there is spray on the margin;<BR>
Reason is the fairest lamp for man.</P>
<P>IX. Rain without, near is the shelter,<BR>
The furze yellow; the cow-parsnip withered and dry;<BR>
God the Creator! why hast thou made a coward?</P>
<P>X. Rain without, my hair is drenched;<BR>
Full of complaint is the feeble; steep the cliff;<BR>
Pale white is the sea; salt is the brine.</P>
<P>XI. Rain without, the ocean is drenched;<BR>
The wind whistles over the tops of the reeds;<BR>
After every feat, still without the genius.</P>
