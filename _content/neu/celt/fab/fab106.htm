<P>I AM the agitator<BR>
Of the praise of God the Ruler.<BR>
With respect to the concerns of song,<BR>
The requisites of a profound speaker,<BR>
A bard, with the breast of an astrologer.<BR>
When he recites<BR>
The Awen at the setting in of the evening.<BR>
On the fine night of a fine day.<BR>
Bards loquacious the light will separate.<BR>
10 Their praise will not bring me to associate,<BR>
In the strath, on the course<BR>
With aspect of great cunning.<BR>
I am not a mute artist,<BR>
Conspicuous among the bards of the people.<BR>
I animate the bold,<BR>
I influence the heedless<BR>
I wake up the looker on,<BR>
The enlightener of bold kings.<BR>
I am not a shallow artist,<BR>
20 Conspicuous among kindred bards,<BR>
The likeness of a subtle portion,<BR>
The deep ocean (is) suitable.<BR>
Who has filled me with hatred? <A NAME="page_534"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 534</FONT></A><BR>
A prize in every unveiling,<BR>
When the dew is undisturbed,<BR>
And the wheat is reaped,<BR>
And the bees are gentle,<BR>
And myrrh and frankincense,<BR>
And transmarine aloes.<BR>
30 And the golden pipes of Lleu,<BR>
And a curtain of excellent silver,<BR>
And a ruddy gem, and berries.<BR>
And the foam of the sea.<BR>
Why will the fountain hasten<BR>
Water-cresses of purifying juicy quality?<BR>
What will join together the common people?<BR>
Wort, the nobility of liquor.<BR>
And a load that the moon separates<BR>
The placid gentleness of Merlyn.<BR>
40 And philosophers of intelligence<BR>
Will study about the moon.<BR>
And the influence of an order of men,<BR>
Exposed to the breeze of the sky.<BR>
And a soddening and effusion,<BR>
And a portion after effusion,<BR>
And the coracle of glass<BR>
In the hand of the pilgrim,<BR>
And the valiant one and pitch,<BR>
And the honoured Segyrffyg,<BR>
50 And medical plants.<BR>
A place of complete benefit,<BR>
And bards and blossoms.<BR>
And gloomy bushes,<BR>
And primroses and small herbs,<BR>
And the points of the tree-shrubs.<BR>
And deficiency and possession,<BR>
And frequent pledging. <A NAME="page_535"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 535</FONT></A><BR>
And wine overflowing the brim,<BR>
From Rome to Rossed.<BR>
60 And deep still water,<BR>
Its stream the gift of God.<BR>
Or if it will be wood the purifier,<BR>
Fruitful its increase.<BR>
Let the brewer give a heat,<BR>
Over a cauldron of-five trees,<BR>
And the river of Gwiawn,<BR>
And the influence of fine weather,<BR>
And honey and trefoil,<BR>
And mead-horns intoxicating<BR>
70 Pleasing to a sovereign,<BR>
The gift of the Druids.</P>
