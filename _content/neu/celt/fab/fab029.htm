<P>I HAVE been in a multitude of shapes,<BR>
Before I assumed a consistent form.<BR>
I have been a sword, narrow, variegated,<BR>
I will believe when it is apparent. <A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A><BR>
I have been a tear in the air,<BR>
I have been the dullest of stars.<BR>
I have been a word among letters,<BR>
I have been a book in the origin.<BR>
I have been the light of lanterns<BR>
10 A year and a half.<BR>
I have been a continuing bridge,<BR>
Over three score Abers.<BR>
I have been a course, I have been an eagle.<BR>
I have been a coracle in the seas:<BR>
I have been compliant in the banquet.<BR>
I have been a drop in a shower;<BR>
I have been a sword in the grasp of the hand:<BR>
I have been a shield in battle.<BR>
I have been a string in a harp,<BR>
20 Disguised for nine years.<BR>
In water, in foam.<BR>
I have been sponge in the fire,<BR>
I have been wood in the covert.<BR>
I am not he who will not sing of<BR>
A combat though small,<BR>
The conflict in the battle of Godeu of sprigs.<BR>
Against the Guledig of Prydain,<BR>
There passed central horses,<BR>
Fleets full of riches.<BR>
30 There passed an animal with wide jaws,<BR>
On it there were a hundred heads.<BR>
And a battle was contested<BR>
Under the root of his tongue;<BR>
And another battle there is<BR>
In his <I>occiput</I>.<BR>
A black sprawling toad,<BR>
With a hundred claws on it.<BR>
A snake speckled, crested. <A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A><BR>
A hundred souls through sin<BR>
40 Shall be tormented in its flesh.<BR>
I have been in Caer Vevenir,<BR>
Thither hastened grass and trees,<BR>
Minstrels were singing,<BR>
Warrior-bands were wondering,<BR>
At the exaltation of the Brython,<BR>
That Gwydyon effected.<BR>
There was a calling on the Creator,<BR>
Upon Christ for causes,<BR>
Until when the Eternal<BR>
50 Should deliver those whom he had made.<BR>
The Lord answered them,<BR>
Through language and elements:<BR>
Take the forms of the principal trees,<BR>
Arranging yourselves in battle array,<BR>
And restraining the public.<BR>
Inexperienced in battle hand to band.<BR>
When the trees were enchanted,<BR>
In the expectation of not being trees,<BR>
The trees uttered their voices<BR>
60 From strings of harmony,<BR>
The disputes ceased.<BR>
Let us cut short heavy days,<BR>
A female restrained the din.<BR>
She came forth altogether lovely.<BR>
The head of the line, the head was a female.<BR>
The advantage of a sleepless cow<BR>
Would not make us give way.<BR>
The blood of men up to our thighs,<BR>
The greatest of importunate mental exertions<BR>
70 Sported in the world.<BR>
And one has ended<BR>
From considering the deluge, <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A><BR>
And Christ crucified,<BR>
And the day of judgment near at hand.<BR>
The alder-trees, the head of the line,<BR>
Formed the van.<BR>
The willows and quicken-trees<BR>
Came late to the army.<BR>
Plum-trees, that are scarce,<BR>
80 Unlonged for of men.<BR>
The elaborate medlar-trees,<BR>
The objects of contention.<BR>
The prickly rose-bushes,<BR>
Against a host of giants,<BR>
The raspberry brake did<BR>
What is better failed<BR>
For the security of life.<BR>
Privet and woodbine<BR>
And ivy on its front,<BR>
90 Like furze to the combat<BR>
The cherry-tree was provoked.<BR>
The birch, notwithstanding his high mind,<BR>
Was late before he was arrayed.<BR>
Not because of his cowardice,<BR>
But on account of his greatness.<BR>
The laburnum held in mind,<BR>
That your wild nature was foreign.<BR>
Pine-trees in the porch,<BR>
The chair of disputation,<BR>
100 By me greatly exalted,<BR>
In the presence of kings.<BR>
The elm with his retinue,<BR>
Did not go aside a foot;<BR>
He would fight with the centre,<BR>
And the flanks, and the rear.<BR>
Hazel-trees, it was judged <A NAME="page_280"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 280</FONT></A><BR>
That ample was thy mental exertion.<BR>
The privet, happy his lot,<BR>
The bull of battle, the lord of the world.<BR>
110 Morawg and Morydd<BR>
Were made prosperous in pines.<BR>
Holly, it was tinted with green,<BR>
He was the hero.<BR>
The hawthorn, surrounded by prickles,<BR>
With pain at his hand.<BR>
The aspen-wood has been topped,<BR>
It was topped in battle.<BR>
The fern that was plundered.<BR>
The broom, in the van of the army,<BR>
120 In the trenches he was hurt.<BR>
The gorse did not do well,<BR>
Notwithstanding let it overspread.<BR>
The heath was victorious, keeping off on all sides.<BR>
The common people were charmed,<BR>
During the proceeding of the men.<BR>
The oak, quickly moving,<BR>
Before him, tremble heaven and earth.<BR>
A valiant door-keeper against an enemy,<BR>
His name is considered.<BR>
130 The blue-bells combined,<BR>
And caused a consternation.<BR>
In rejecting, were rejected,<BR>
Others, that were perforated.<BR>
Pear-trees, the best intruders<BR>
In the conflict of the plain.<BR>
A very wrathful wood,<BR>
The chestnut is bashful,<BR>
The opponent of happiness,<BR>
The jet has become black, <A NAME="page_281"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 281</FONT></A><BR>
140 The mountain has become crooked,<BR>
The woods have become a kiln,<BR>
Existing formerly in the great seas,<BR>
Since was heard the shout:--<BR>
The tops of the birch covered us with leaves,<BR>
And transformed us, and changed our faded state.<BR>
The branches of the oak have ensnared us<BR>
From the Gwarchan of Maelderw.<BR>
Laughing on the side of the rock,<BR>
The lord is not of an ardent nature.<BR>
150 Not of mother and father,<BR>
When I was made,<BR>
Did my Creator create me.<BR>
Of nine-formed faculties,<BR>
Of the fruit of fruits,<BR>
Of the fruit of the primordial God,<BR>
Of primroses and blossoms of the hill,<BR>
Of the flowers of trees and shrubs.<BR>
Of earth, of an earthly course,<BR>
When I was formed.<BR>
160 Of the flower of nettles,<BR>
Of the water of the ninth wave.<BR>
I was enchanted by Math,<BR>
Before I became immortal,<BR>
I was enchanted by Gwydyon<BR>
The great purifier of the Brython,<BR>
Of Eurwys, of Euron,<BR>
Of Euron, of Modron.<BR>
Of five battalions of scientific ones,<BR>
Teachers, children of Math.<BR>
170 When the removal occurred,<BR>
I was enchanted by the Guledig.<BR>
When he was half-burnt,<BR>
I was enchanted by the sage <A NAME="page_282"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 282</FONT></A><BR>
Of sages, in the primitive world.<BR>
When I had a being;<BR>
When the host of the world was in dignity,<BR>
The bard was accustomed to benefits.<BR>
To the song of praise I am inclined, which the tongue recites.<BR>
I played in the twilight,<BR>
180 I slept in purple;<BR>
I was truly in the enchantment<BR>
With Dylan, the son of the wave.<BR>
In the circumference, in the middle,<BR>
Between the knees of kings,<BR>
Scattering spears not keen,<BR>
From heaven when came,<BR>
To the great deep, floods,<BR>
In the battle there will be<BR>
Four score hundreds,<BR>
190 That will divide according to their will.<BR>
They are neither older nor younger,<BR>
Than myself in their divisions.<BR>
A wonder, Canhwr arc born, every one of nine hundred.<BR>
He was with me also,<BR>
With my sword spotted with blood.<BR>
Honour was allotted to me<BR>
By the Lord, and protection (was) where he was.<BR>
If I come to where the boar was killed,<BR>
He will compose, he will decompose,<BR>
200 He will form languages.<BR>
The strong-handed gleamer, his name,<BR>
With a gleam he rules his numbers.<BR>
They would spread out in a flame,<BR>
When I shall go on high.<BR>
I have been a speckled snake on the hill, <A NAME="page_283"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 283</FONT></A><BR>
I have been a viper in the Llyn.<BR>
I have been a bill-hook crooked that cuts,<BR>
I have been a ferocious spear<BR>
With my chasuble and bowl<BR>
210 I will prophesy not badly,<BR>
Four score smokes<BR>
On every one what will bring.<BR>
Five battalions of arms<BR>
Will be caught by my knife.<BR>
Six steeds of yellow hue<BR>
A hundred times better is<BR>
My cream-coloured steed,<BR>
Swift as the sea-mew<BR>
Which will not pass<BR>
220 Between the sea and the shore.<BR>
Am I not pre-eminent in the field of blood?<BR>
Over it are a hundred chieftains.<BR>
Crimson (is) the gem of my belt,<BR>
Gold my shield border.<BR>
There has not been born, in the gap,<BR>
That has been visiting me,<BR>
Except Goronwy,<BR>
From the dales of Edrywy.<BR>
Long white my fingers,<BR>
230 It is long since I have been a herdsman.<BR>
I travelled in the earth,<BR>
Before I was a proficient in learning.<BR>
I travelled, I made a circuit,<BR>
I slept in a hundred islands.<BR>
A hundred Caers I have dwelt in.<BR>
Ye intelligent Druids,<BR>
Declare to Arthur,<BR>
What is there more early<BR>
Than I that they sing of. <A NAME="page_284"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 284</FONT></A><BR>
240 And one is come<BR>
From considering the deluge,<BR>
And Christ crucified,<BR>
And the day of future doom.<BR>
A golden gem in a golden jewel.<BR>
I am splendid<BR>
And shall be wanton<BR>
From the oppression of the metal-workers.</P>
