<P>I. THE wealth of the world, let it go, it will come,<BR>
As long as it is esteemed.<BR>
Necessity equalises affliction,<BR>
There will be fair weather after rain.<BR>
It is often the case that persons fostered by the same are unlike.<BR>
The brave will play though blood way be shed.<BR>
Every coward will be trampled upon;<BR>
Every strong one will be allowed to pass.<BR>
The happy is pleased with harmonious sounds,<BR>
Which God will freely pour upon him.</P>
<P>II. The wealth of the world, let it go, it will come;<BR>
May God provide what suffices!<BR>
Loud is the noise of the wave against the land;<BR>
When called, it recedeth from it.<BR>
Listless is the man that sees not,<BR>
That is not concerned, that cares not what may be.<BR>
Where justice is not practised, it is not entertained in the country.<BR>
Mass will not be sting on a flight.<BR>
Let him be a wolf that dareth deceive.<BR>
Desirous will the scholar be that Llawddino should prosper.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_597"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 597</FONT></A></P>
<P>III. The wealth of the world, let it go, it will come.<BR>
Desire calls for the return of liberty.<BR>
The height of the young will increase.<BR>
Lying praise will not be borrowed.<BR>
The slave and the free are not of the same design.<BR>
Empty the country, where there is no religion.<BR>
There will be a return which will not be repeated.<BR>
Cold does not agree with the hoary.<BR>
The unbeliever does not think of God.<BR>
No one that does not improve is called skilful.<BR>
Let us observe and acquire religion,<BR>
Until we have relationship with Christ.</P>
<P>IV. The unsociable man is uncomely in the place of gathering.<BR>
Trouble in the upland, enmity in the vale.<BR>
A refusal is better than a false promise.<BR>
In one's actions servility is supererogatory.<BR>
The sweet is seldom unpleasant.<BR>
The evil done by a fellow will survive after he has passed away.<BR>
An excuse is not usually regarded.<BR>
Good cannot be had without deserts.<BR>
The four quarters open deeply in four different ways.<BR>
It is a saying that death is better than trouble.<BR>
Bad is sin from its being far pursued.<BR>
It is good in distress to support a monastery.<BR>
God of Heaven! woe to the daring one that does not believe thee!<BR>
Son of Mary! endowed with undefiled genius,<BR>
It is a good work to hope in thee;<BR>
Before the world thou art mentioned.</P>
<P>V. The wave hastens forward; let it beat the shore.<BR>
The fuel of wrath is impulsive. <A NAME="page_598"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 598</FONT></A><BR>
Watch-stones form the best history.<BR>
The wisdom of a host, and deception through laughter.<BR>
Let fundamental knowledge be accurate.<BR>
Let the weakling be slow; let the niggard die.<BR>
The evil alliance of Gall Cynnin.<BR>
With a wanton a secret will not long remain.<BR>
Blood will cause blood to flow,<BR>
The froward will meet with contention.<BR>
Let the weak be set at large.<BR>
The iniquitous will lose his clan.<BR>
Except God, there is no one that knows the future.<BR>
Its lord is the chief cause of prosperity to a country.</P>
<P>VI. The wave hastens forward; the beach repels.<BR>
Light pain will soon be relieved;<BR>
The multitude will bustle about the mead-liquor.<BR>
Let him who ejects every one from his frontier cease to exist.<BR>
Let the obstinate be cut off.<BR>
Whoso purchases heaven will not be confounded.<BR>
How curious thou art that any should mention it.<BR>
The trees have put on a beauteous robe.<BR>
A mirror is not visible in the dark.<BR>
A candle will not preserve from cold.<BR>
He is not happy who is not discreet.<BR>
The favour of the Supreme Being will not deceive.</P>
<P>VII. He who cultivates not wisdom as the chief foundation,<BR>
What will put a bird to flight he will not do.<BR>
Cold is the sway of winter; bare the sea-shore.<BR>
Better is what is easy than the encountering of difficulties.<BR>
Reproach will not mend what is evil.<BR>
Many a boastful word will cause embarrassment.<BR>
To the bosom, while it goes about; <A NAME="page_599"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 599</FONT></A><BR>
From haste it cannot be known where it will go.<BR>
The Trinity will retaliate arrogance.<BR>
Great God! how good a Being thou art!</P>
<P>VIII. Fleet is the steed; clear is every strand;<BR>
The desire of the high-minded one is chivalry.<BR>
No one reaps from his contrivance.<BR>
Every one is not born wise.<BR>
The mind is not bold in a ship on the strand.<BR>
There will be no peace between dry sticks and the flame.<BR>
Let a man live without evil conduct,<BR>
Courteous to song, I confer benefits on those in a state of excommunication.<BR>
No naked one will be very energetic.<BR>
There is no law unless there be supremacy.<BR>
A king will challenge spoil.<BR>
The furious, his death is certain.<BR>
Is it not customary that cowardice should harbour from death.<BR>
Let the brave escape from his conflict.<BR>
Intoxicated the dumb; every barbarian is a bravado.<BR>
A city will extinguish a wilderness.<BR>
The talkative loves easy work.<BR>
Every one is praised according to his work.<BR>
God loves not the hopeless.<BR>
Fortune is the best assistance.</P>
<P>IX. In spring the land is partly bare,<BR>
If people are turbulent, their shout is deceitful.<BR>
In calm reflection riches are despised.<BR>
What is not often seen is neglected.<BR>
He that is faithless, his presumption will be contemned.<BR>
It is a complete share that is longed for.<BR>
Let the woman that is never asked appear demure. <A NAME="page_600"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 600</FONT></A><BR>
Disgrace is apt to follow long celibacy.<BR>
He that will not completely conceal himself, will be completely taken away.<BR>
From a long restraint comes complaint.<BR>
What seemeth good to God is certain.<BR>
He that is brave, his praise will be heard abroad.<BR>
From a little comes enrichment.<BR>
Blessed is he to whom are given<BR>
The favour of God and long life.</P>
