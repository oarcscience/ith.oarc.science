<P>I WILL address my Lord,<BR>
To consider the Awen.<BR>
What brought necessity<BR>
Before the time of Ceridwen.<BR>
Primarily through my life<BR>
Poverty has been.<BR>
The wealthy monks<BR>
Why will they not speak to me?<BR>
Why will they not cause me to tremble?<BR>
10 One hour that I was not followed,<BR>
What disappearance of smoke?<BR>
Why sang he evil?<BR>
What fountain breaks out<BR>
Above the covert of darkness?<BR>
When the reed is white, <A NAME="page_543"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 543</FONT></A><BR>
When it is a moonlight night.<BR>
Another was not sung,<BR>
It was shaken out,<BR>
When is apt to be forward<BR>
20 The noise of waves on the shore.<BR>
In the vengeance of the ocean,<BR>
A day will reach to them.<BR>
When a stone is so heavy,<BR>
When a thorn is so sharp.<BR>
Knowest thou which is best?<BR>
Its base or its point,<BR>
Who caused a partition<BR>
Between man and frigidity?<BR>
Whose is the wholesomest sore?<BR>
30 The young or the old?<BR>
Knowest thou what thou art<BR>
When thou art sleeping?<BR>
Whether a body or a soul,<BR>
Or a secresy of perception?<BR>
The ingenious minstrel,<BR>
Why does he not inform me?<BR>
Knowest thou where should be<BR>
The night waiting the passing of the day?<BR>
Knowest thou a sign,<BR>
40 How many leaves there are?<BR>
Who uplifted the mountain,<BR>
Before the elements fell?<BR>
Who supports the structure<BR>
Of the earth for a habitation?<BR>
The soul of whom is complained of?<BR>
Who has seen it, who knows?<BR>
I wonder in books<BR>
That they know not truly<BR>
The soul, what is its seat. <A NAME="page_544"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 544</FONT></A><BR>
50 What form its limbs,<BR>
Through what part it pours out.<BR>
What air it respires?<BR>
A war petulant,<BR>
A sinner endangered.<BR>
A wonder in mockery,<BR>
What were its dregs.<BR>
Which is the best intoxication,<BR>
Of mead or of bragget?<BR>
When their happiness<BR>
60 Was protected by the God of Trinity<BR>
Why should I utter a treatise,<BR>
Except of thee?<BR>
Who caused coin<BR>
Of current silver?<BR>
When is so current<BR>
A ear so prickly;<BR>
Death having a foundation,<BR>
In every country is shared.<BR>
Death above our head,<BR>
70 Wide is its covering,<BR>
High above the canopy of heaven.<BR>
Man is oldest when he is born.<BR>
And is younger (and) younger continually,<BR>
What is there to be anxious about,<BR>
Of the present attainment?<BR>
After a want of property,<BR>
Does it not make to us a shortness of life?<BR>
Enough of sadness,<BR>
The visitation of the grave.<BR>
80 And the One that made us,<BR>
From the supreme country,<BR>
Be he our God, and bring us<BR>
To him at the end!</P>
