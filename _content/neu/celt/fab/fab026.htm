<P>GOD preserve the heavens<BR>
From a flood wide spreading.<BR>
The first surging billow<BR>
Has rolled over the sea-beach.<BR>
What tree is greater<BR>
Than he, Daronwy?<BR>
I know not for a refuge<BR>
Around the proud circle of heaven,<BR>
That there is a mystery which is greater.<BR>
10 The light of the men of Goronwy.<BR>
Perhaps it may be known,<BR>
The magic wand of Mathonwy,<BR>
In the wood when it grows.<BR>
Fruits more profitable,<BR>
On the bank of Gwyllyonwy.<BR>
Cynan shall obtain it,<BR>
At the time when he governs.<BR>
There will come yet<BR>
Over the ebb and over the strand,<BR>
20 Four chief sovereignties,<BR>
And the fifth not worse.<BR>
Men vehement, extensive. <A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A><BR>
Over Prydain (their) purpose.<BR>
Women shall be eloquent,<BR>
Strangers shall be captive,<BR>
A torrent of longing<BR>
For mead and horsemanship.<BR>
There will come two ladies,<BR>
A widow, and a slender single one;<BR>
30 Iron their wings,<BR>
On warriors brooding.<BR>
Chieftains will come,<BR>
From about the land of Rome.<BR>
Their song will harmonise,<BR>
Their praise will spread abroad.<BR>
The nature of the oak and thorns<BR>
In song will harmonise.<BR>
A dog to draw,<BR>
A horse to move.<BR>
40 An ox to gore; a sow to turn up.<BR>
The fifth fair young beast Jesus made<BR>
From the apparel of Adam to proceed.<BR>
The foliage of trees, fair to behold them,<BR>
Whilst they were, and whilst it was.<BR>
When the Cymry shall commit transgressions,<BR>
A foreigner will be found, who will love what was?<BR>
I have leaped a leap from a clear leap,<BR>
Good has been dispersed abroad, if a person finds no evil.<BR>
The funeral-pile of Run, it is an expiation,<BR>
50 Between Caer Rian and Caer Rywg,<BR>
Between Dineiddyn and Dineiddwg<BR>
A clear glance and a watchful sight.<BR>
From the agitation of fire smoke will be raised,<BR>
And God our Creator will defend us.</P>
