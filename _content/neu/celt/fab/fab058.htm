<P>THE lion will be most implacable;<BR>
I will not deplore him.<BR>
Urien I will approach,<BR>
To him I will sing.<BR>
When will come my surety,<BR>
I shall obtain admission.<BR>
Of the very best part,<BR>
Under the flow of melody,<BR>
It concerns me not much,<BR>
10 The everlasting lineage which I see.<BR>
I will not go to them, I will not be with them.<BR>
I will not address the North<BR>
And the kings of the plain.<BR>
Though there should be for many<BR>
That I should see a mutual pledging.<BR>
I have no need of affection:<BR>
Urien will not refuse me<BR>
The lands of Llwyvenydd.<BR>
Mine is their wealth,<BR>
20 Mine are the festivals,<BR>
Mine is the produce,<BR>
Mine are the metals,<BR>
And its rich productions.<BR>
Mead out of buffalo-horns<BR>
And good in abundance,<BR>
From the best prince,<BR>
The most generous that has been heard of. <A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A><BR>
The chiefs of every language<BR>
To thee are all captive.<BR>
30 For thee there will be lamentation when thy death is certain.<BR>
Though I should have preferred him<BR>
After being benefited, I would grow old.<BR>
There was not one that I loved better,<BR>
(Of those) that I knew before.<BR>
At times I see<BR>
The amount of what I shall have.<BR>
Except to God supreme,<BR>
I will not renounce<BR>
Thy royal sons,<BR>
40 The most generous of men,<BR>
Their spears shall resound<BR>
In the land of their enemies.<BR>
And until I fail in old age,<BR>
In the sore necessity of death,<BR>
May I not be smiling,<BR>
If I praise not Urien.</P>
