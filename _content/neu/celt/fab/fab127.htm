<P>I. SITTING high upon a hill, battle-inclined is<BR>
My mind, and it does not impel me onward:<BR>
Short is my journey, my tenement is laid waste.</P>
<P>II. Sharp is the gale, it is bare punishment to live;<BR>
When the trees array themselves in gay colours<BR>
Of summer; violently ill I am this day.</P>
<P>III. I am no hunter, I keep no animal of the chase;<BR>
I cannot move about:<BR>
As long as it pleases the cuckoo, let her sing!</P>
<P>IV. The loud-voiced cuckoo sings with the dawn,<BR>
Her melodious notes in the dales of Cuawg:<BR>
Better is the lavisher than the miser.</P>
<P>V. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing,<BR>
On the blossom-covered branches:<BR>
The loud-voiced cuckoo, let her sing a while!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_581"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 581</FONT></A></P>
<P>VI. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing,<BR>
On the blossom-covered branches:<BR>
Woe to the sick that hears their contented notes.</P>
<P>VII. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing:<BR>
The recollection is in my mind!<BR>
There are that hear them that will not bear them again!</P>
<P>VIII. Have I not listened to the cuckoo on the ivied tree?<BR>
Did not my shield hang down?<BR>
What I loved is but vexation; what I loved is no more.</P>
<P>IX. High above the merry oak,<BR>
I have listened to the song of birds.<BR>
The loud cuckoo--every one remembers what he loves.</P>
<P>X. Songstress with the solacing song! her voice is grief exciting:<BR>
Subject to wander, with the flight of the hawk,<BR>
The loquacious cuckoo at Aber Cuawg.</P>
<P>XI. The birds are clamorous; humid are the glens:<BR>
Let the moon shine; cold the midnight hour:<BR>
Distracted is my mind from the torment of disorder.</P>
<P>XII. White-topped is the cliff; long the midnight hour:<BR>
Every ingenious one-will be honoured:<BR>
I owe the indulgence of sleep to old age.</P>
<P>XIII. The birds are clamorous; the beach is wet:<BR>
Let the leaves fall; the exile is unconcerned:<BR>
I will not conceal it, I am ill this night.</P>
<P>XIV. The birds are clamorous; the strand is wet:<BR>
Clear is the sky; large the wave:<BR>
The heart is palsied with longing.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_582"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 582</FONT></A></P>
<P>XV. The birds are clamorous; the strand is wet:<BR>
Conspicuous is the wave with its ample range:<BR>
What was formed in my youth,<BR>
I could love, if I could have it again.</P>
<P>XVI. Clamorous are the birds on the scent;<BR>
Loud the cry of dogs in a desert;<BR>
Again clamorous are the birds.</P>
<P>XVII. In the beginning of summer, gay are all varied seeds!<BR>
When the warriors hasten to the conflict,<BR>
I do not go, infirmity will not leave me.</P>
<P>XVIII. In the beginning of summer, it is glorious on the course,<BR>
When the warriors hasten to the field of battle;<BR>
I shall not go, infirmity separates me.</P>
<P>XIX. Hoary is the mountain summit; the tops of the ash are brittle:<BR>
From the Abers the fair wave is impelled:<BR>
Laughter is far from my heart.</P>
<P>XX. What is it to me this day at the end of the month?<BR>
In the social banquet I have left it:<BR>
Distracted is my mind; a fever has made choice of me.</P>
<P>XXI. Quick is the sight of the sentinel;<BR>
Let the idle use courtesy:<BR>
Distracted is my mind; disease preys upon me.</P>
<P>XXII. Riches like a bowl encircling mead,<BR>
The happy man will not wish for:<BR>
It is a precious thing to know patience.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_583"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 583</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXIII. Riches like a bowl round the cheering beverage,<BR>
The gliding stream, the refreshing shower,<BR>
And the deep ford: the mind is stirred to treachery.</P>
<P>XXIV. To foment treachery is an iniquitous deed;<BR>
There will be pain where there will be purifying;<BR>
It is to sell a little for much.</P>
<P>XXV. Let the wicked be fomenting treachery;<BR>
When God will judge, at the long day,<BR>
Dark will be falsehood, truth clear.</P>
<P>XXVI. There is danger in repelling the graduated visitor;<BR>
Men are joyous over the beverage:<BR>
Frail is the reed, of riches an emblem.</P>
<P>XXVII. Hear the wave of sullen din, and loud,<BR>
Amidst the pebbles and gravel:<BR>
Distracted is my mind from delirium this night.</P>
<P>XXVIII. Branching is the top of the oak; bitter the taste of the ash:<BR>
Sweet the cow-parsnip; the wave is laughing:<BR>
The cheek will not conceal the affliction of the heart.</P>
<P>XXIX. The heaving sigh tells upon me,<BR>
After my experience  .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
God will not bestow on the wicked what is good.</P>
<P>XXX. To the wicked what is good will not be given;<BR>
But sorrow and anxiety:<BR>
God will not undo what he is doing,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_584"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 584</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXXI. The son of sickness has been a brisk youth, he had<BR>
An active share in the court of the king;<BR>
May God be propitious to the diviner!</P>
<P>XXXII. As to what is being done, it will come to pass,<BR>
Let him that reads it consider:<BR>
What is detested by man here, is detested by God above.</P>
