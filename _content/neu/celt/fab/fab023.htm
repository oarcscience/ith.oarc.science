<P>WHAT man is the porter?<BR>
Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr.<BR>
Who is the man that asks it?<BR>
Arthur and the fair Cai.<BR>
How goes it with thee?<BR>
Truly in the best way in the world.<BR>
Into my house thou shalt not come, <A NAME="page_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A><BR>
Unless thou prevailest,<BR>
I forbid it.<BR>
10 Thou shalt see it.<BR>
If Wythnaint were to go,<BR>
The three would be unlucky:--<BR>
Mabon, the, son of Mydron,<BR>
The servant of Uthir Pendragon;<BR>
Cysgaint, the son of Banon;<BR>
And Gwyn Godybrion.<BR>
Terrible were my servants<BR>
Defending their rights.<BR>
Manawydan, the son of Llyr,<BR>
20 Deep was his counsel.<BR>
Did not Manawyd bring<BR>
Perforated shields from Trywruid?<BR>
And Mabon, the son of Mellt,<BR>
Spotted the grass with blood?<BR>
And Anwas Adeiniog,<BR>
And Llwch Llawynnog--<BR>
Guardians were they<BR>
On Eiddyn Cymminog,<BR>
A chieftain that patronised them.<BR>
30 He would have his will and make redress.<BR>
Cai entreated him,<BR>
While he idled every third person.<BR>
When Celli was lost<BR>
Cuelli was found; and rejoiced<BR>
Cai, as long as he hewed down.<BR>
Arthur distributed gifts,<BR>
The blood trickled down.<BR>
In the hall of Awarnach,<BR>
Fighting with a hag,<BR>
40 He cleft the head of Palach.<BR>
In the fastnesses of Dissethach, <A NAME="page_263"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 263</FONT></A><BR>
In Mynyd Eiddyn,<BR>
He contended with Cynvyn;<BR>
By the hundred there they fell,<BR>
There they fell by the hundred,<BR>
Before the accomplished Bedwyr.<BR>
On the strands of Trywruid,<BR>
Contending with Garwlwyd,<BR>
Brave was his disposition,<BR>
50 With sword and shield;<BR>
Vanity were the foremost men<BR>
Compared with Cai in the battle.<BR>
The sword in the battle<BR>
Was unerring in his hand.<BR>
They were stanch commanders<BR>
Of a legion for the benefit of the country--<BR>
Bedwyr and Bridlaw;<BR>
Nine hundred would to them listen;<BR>
Six hundred gasping for breath<BR>
60 Would be the cost of attacking them.<BR>
Servants I have had,<BR>
Better it was when they were.<BR>
Before the chiefs of Emrais<BR>
I saw Cai in haste.<BR>
Booty for chieftains<BR>
Was Gwrhir among foes,<BR>
Heavy was his vengeance,<BR>
Severe his advance.<BR>
When he drank from the horn,<BR>
70 He would drink with four.<BR>
To battle when he would come<BR>
By the hundred would he slaughter;<BR>
There was no day that would satisfy him.<BR>
Unmerited was the death of Cai.<BR>
Cai the fair, and Llachau, <A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A><BR>
Battles did they sustain,<BR>
Before the pang of blue shafts.<BR>
In the heights of Ystavingon<BR>
Cai pierced nine witches.<BR>
80 Cai the fair went to Mona,<BR>
To devastate Llewon.<BR>
His shield was ready<BR>
Against Cath Palug<BR>
When the people welcomed him.<BR>
Who pierced the Cath Palug?<BR>
Nine score before dawn<BR>
Would fall for its food.<BR>
Nine score chieftains.</P>
