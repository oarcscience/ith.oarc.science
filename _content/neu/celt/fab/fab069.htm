<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>Every ode of the Gododin is equivalent to a single song, according to the privilege of poetical composition. Each of the Gwarchans is equal to three hundred and sixty-three songs, because the number of the men who went to Catraeth is commemorated in the Gorchans; and as no man should go to battle without arms, so no bard ought to contend without that poem.</P>
<P>Here now begins the Gwarchan of Maelderw. Taliessin sung it, and it is a privileged ode. His three Gwarchans are equal in poetical competition to all the odes in the Gododin.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">_____________</P>
<P>The noise of two Abers around the Caer!<BR>
Arouse thyself to arms and splendour! <A NAME="page_415"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 415</FONT></A><BR>
Cold is the passing and repassing of the breach of battle.<BR>
Lover of fame, seekest thou to sleep?<BR>
The variegated texture, the covering of heroism,<BR>
For the shelterless assault shall be woven.<BR>
The breach that has been attempted will not be effected.<BR>
Bear the patient exertion of heroism.<BR>
Sharply in arms he used to frown,<BR>
10 But mildly allured he the intellectual world.<BR>
A man that will run when thou pursuest,<BR>
Will have the rounded house of the sepulchre for his bed.<BR>
Call together, but do not reproach the over-anxious;<BR>
And meddle not with the fierce and violent.<BR>
Let him who has a just claim break the boundary.<BR>
He does not calculate upon praise<BR>
Who defends his shelter.<BR>
Praise is the meed of those who have made impressions.<BR>
The victor gazed towards the fair one.<BR>
20 Of bright and prominent uplifted front,<BR>
On the ruddy dragon, the palladium of Pharaon,<BR>
Which will in the air accompany the people.<BR>
Dead is every one that fell on his mouth<BR>
In the repulsion of the march of Teth and Teddyd.<BR>
Courteous was the great retinue of the wall, of ashen spears.<BR>
To the sea thou mayst not come;<BR>
But neither thy retreat nor thy counsel will fail,<BR>
Thou magnanimous soul in the defence of his boundaries.<BR>
No more can they extricate themselves,<BR>
30 Extricate themselves before the barrier of Eiddyn.<BR>
Cenan, the fair wall of excellence,<BR>
Placed a sword on the entrenchment of warriors.<BR>
Victorious was the chief<BR>
In dispossessing the sovereign,<BR>
The inconstant <A NAME="page_416"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 416</FONT></A><BR>
Gray-headed chief of ministers,<BR>
Whose counsels were deep.<BR>
The mutually sweet will not produce the mutually bitter.<BR>
I have mutually wished,<BR>
40 I do mutually wish for the repose of Eulli<BR>
The fair aspect of which is filled with deep interest,<BR>
On the course on a serene morning.<BR>
It allures me, it plays upon my strong desire.<BR>
I will ask the men for a dwelling,<BR>
In order to lessen the loss.<BR>
Happiness was lost and recovered.<BR>
The Northern Run, chieftain, thou hast caused to withdraw<BR>
The fat one in returning thou wilt cause to return to me.<BR>
They call more for large trees than for honeysuckles.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>Three lines untranslated</I>).<BR>
Let the sovereign stand firm between the looks of Dremrudd,<BR>
The ruddy glancer, whose purpose cannot be viewed for a sufficient time,<BR>
Whose purpose cannot be viewed for a sufficient time,<BR>
By those who with impunity plough the noisy sea.<BR>
First to be satisfied is the pale one,<BR>
The eccentric, whose throne is of complete form.<BR>
Before he was covered, Gownddelw<BR>
60 Was a tall man of great worth like Maelderw.<BR>
I will extol him who wields the spear,<BR>
Whose course is like that of the ruler of the mount,<BR>
The pervader of the land, by whose influence I am moved.<BR>
With active tumult did he descend to the ravine between the hills,<BR>
Nor was his presence a running shadow.<BR>
Whatever may befall the high land,<BR>
Disgrace shall never happen to the assembled train.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_417"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 417</FONT></A></P>
<P>I. It is well that Adonwy came, Adonwy to those that were left.<BR>
What Bradwen did, thou hast done; thou didst kill and burn,<BR>
Thou didst not keep the rear or the van.<BR>
I know the aspect of thy helmet. I have not seen from sea<BR>
To sea a worse knight than Odgur.</P>
<P>II. Three hundred golden-torqued ones hastened along<BR>
To engage in the conflict; a sally ensued;<BR>
And though they were killed, they also killed;<BR>
And unto the end of the world honoured they shall be;<BR>
And of those who went in mutual amity,<BR>
Alas! except one man none escaped.</P>
<P>III. Three hundred wearing the golden torques,<BR>
Fond of valorous toil, and headlong in the course;<BR>
Three hundred haughty ones,<BR>
Unanimous, and equally armed.<BR>
Three hundred prancing horses<BR>
Did with them hasten.<BR>
Three chiefs and three hundred,<BR>
Alas! none returned.</P>
<P>IV. Furious in the battle, unreceding in distress;<BR>
In the conflict there was no peace if he acted vigorously;<BR>
In the day of wrath, shunning was no part of his work;<BR>
The aspect of a boar had Bleiddig son of Eli;<BR>
Wine was quaffed in brimful vessels of glass;<BR>
And the day of battle, exploits did he achieve<BR>
On Arvwl Cann, before he died.<BR>
Ruddy-tinted carnage used to attract him:</P>
<P>V. Vigorously in the front of battles would he cause the crimson fluid to flow, <A NAME="page_413"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 413</FONT></A><BR>
Powerful as an instrument in battle,<BR>
And splendidly covered with mail.<BR>
Report informs me<BR>
That the dexterous blade<BR>
Will not be manifested<BR>
To the diffident.</P>
<P>VI. He would reduce men to ashes,<BR>
And make wives widows,<BR>
Before his death,--<BR>
Breint, son of Bleiddgi;<BR>
With spears would he<BR>
Cause blood to flow.</P>
<P>VII. Great is the design of him who conceals his vigorous attack;<BR>
His weapon he will conceal<BR>
Like a hidden treasure.<BR>
When all ascended, thou descendest.<BR>
Ceneu Gwyn, the blood of the dead how didst thou shed!<BR>
Three years and four,<BR>
Thou, guardian, didst put on magnificent raiment.<BR>
And to protect thee,<BR>
Though a youth, it was not right for me, for thou didst not retreat.<BR>
Pressent narrates that he was carried away with the arms.</P>
<P>VIII. When he repaired to his native country, his fame was spread abroad;<BR>
He poured out the wine, the golden-torqued man!<BR>
He would give a gorgeously fine suit to a brave person,<BR>
And check a hundred men, courteous hero!<BR>
And send away the progeny of a foreign knight;--<BR>
The only son of Cian from beyond Bannawg, <A NAME="page_419"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 419</FONT></A><BR>
Never did in Gododin tread on the surface of the fosse,<BR>
While he was, any one more ardent than Lliv.</P>
<P>IX. Anger, the scatterer of the brave, serpent with the piercing pike,<BR>
An immovable stone in front of the army;<BR>
Accustomed to the preparation of attacks,<BR>
And greatly to reward the assaulting lance.<BR>
Perfect art thou called from thy just deed,<BR>
Leader, director, and bulwark of all that are of the same language:<BR>
Tudvwlch, the subduer in battle, the destroyer of Caers.</P>
<P>X. Anger, the scatterer of the brave, serpent with the piercing pike in the front of the army;<BR>
Perfect art thou called from thy just deed.<BR>
Faithful art thou called from thy faithful deed.<BR>
Leader, director, and the bulwark of every tribe,<BR>
Meryn, son of Madyeith, it is well that thou art born!</P>
<P>XI. Gwolowy secured a gray wolf, whose roaring was as that of water.<BR>
Angor, the scatterer of the brave, an immovable stone in the front of the army.<BR>
Ruddy radiance, and horses, and men were in front of Gododin,<BR>
Whence so rapidly ascends the address<BR>
Of the Bard of the Cymry, Tottarth, in front of Garth Merin.</P>
<P>XII. His shield, with endurance, he would not lower<BR>
Before the face of any one; wrong he would not encourage.<BR>
Urgent were the requests for horses in the entrance. <A NAME="page_420"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 420</FONT></A><BR>
The gold of the heroes, the crowd of holly lances covered it with gore,<BR>
While his comrade was pierced, he pierced others;<BR>
Disgrace to thee he would not bring:<BR>
Active in martial valour, he made a noble display,<BR>
When he carried away the famous Cyhuran of Mordei.</P>
<P>XIII. Falsely it was said by Tudleo,<BR>
That no one's steeds were overtaken by Marchlew,<BR>
As he was reared to bring support to all around:<BR>
Powerful was the stroke of his sword on the adversary;<BR>
Eagerly ascended the ashen spear from the grasp<BR>
Of his hand, from the narrow summit of the awful pile.</P>
<P>XIV. Direct us to heaven, the wished-for home of order!<BR>
Woe to us on account of constant lamentation and grief!<BR>
When the strangers came from Dineiddyn,<BR>
Every wise man was banished the country.<BR>
In the contention with Lloegyr of various conflicts,<BR>
Nine score for every one were made prostrate.<BR>
An array of horses, harness, and silken robes,<BR>
Gwaednerth arranged conspicuously from the battle.</P>
<P>XV. From the retinue of Mynyddawg that hastened<BR>
In splendid order around the store of beverage regaled they themselves,<BR>
From the banquet of Mynyddawg, my mind has become sad,<BR>
Because of those of my true kinsmen I have completely lost.<BR>
Of three hundred golden-wreathed heroes, who marched to Catraeth,<BR>
Alas! except one man none escaped.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_421"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 421</FONT></A></P>
<P>XVI. The retinue of Gododin rode on<BR>
Swan-coloured horses with quivering manes and drooping harness,<BR>
And in front of the host, the throng descended,<BR>
In defence. of his generalship, and the mead of Eiddyn,<BR>
By the advice of Mynyddawg.<BR>
The shields were moved about,<BR>
The lances fell<BR>
Upon fair brows,<BR>
While the men were languidly dropping like fruit from the tree.<BR>
They bore no reproach, men that did not skulk.</P>
<P>XVII. Have I not drunk mead on the march,<BR>
A banquet of wine before Catraeth as a preservative?<BR>
When he made slaughter with his unyielding lance<BR>
In the conflict, it was no inglorious sight to see where thou wert.<BR>
A monster wag no frightful object to thee while effecting deliverance,<BR>
Terrible and shielded Madawg Elved.</P>
<P>XVIII. When they fairly met, there was no escaping for life.<BR>
Dialgur of Arvon fetched bright gold at the request<BR>
Of the Brython. High-mettled were the horses of Cynon.</P>
<P>XIX. Llech Lleudu, and Tud Lleuvre,<BR>
The course, the course of Gododin.<BR>
A hand! a hand! a counsel! a counsel!<BR>
A tempest over the sea! a vessel from beyond sea!<BR>
The host of Heidiliawn, the host of Meidlyawn, a degenerate host,<BR>
Moving from Dindywydd.<BR>
Battered was the shield before the bull of conflict, the van was broken.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_422"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 422</FONT></A></P>
<P>XX. Golden-mailed warriors were there on the walls of the Caer;<BR>
Slow was the excess, but the tumult of battle was not dilatory.<BR>
One feeble man with his shouts kept away<BR>
The birds of the region, like Pelloid Mirain.<BR>
No one living will relate what happened<BR>
At Lliw, about the banks of Llwch Llivanad;<BR>
No one living will relate of any one to whom in the day of conflict<BR>
Cynaval was not equal in merit.</P>
<P>XXI. No achievement to-day around Neimyn!<BR>
The same covering envelopes men of the noblest descent.<BR>
A numerous host engaged in battle which is worth relating,<BR>
The son of Nwython killed of the golden-torqued ones<BR>
A hundred chieftains, as far as it is related, the vehemence<BR>
Was greater than when a hundred men went to Catraeth.<BR>
He was like a mead-fed hero with a large heart.<BR>
He was a man of hosts; energetic was he in his coat of mail,<BR>
He was a man of conflict, fierce was he on the ridge of Cavall.<BR>
No man among a thousand brave warriors<BR>
Handled a spear, or a shield, or a sword, or a dagger,<BR>
Who was a braver man than Neim the son of Nwython.</P>
<P>XXII. While there was a drop, they were like three lions in purpose;<BR>
In the battle three brave, prompt, active lions.<BR>
Bribon who wielded the thick lance,</P>
<P>XXIII. Accustomed was he to defend Gododin against a hero,<BR>
In the van of battle, against vehement ones, <A NAME="page_423"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 423</FONT></A><BR>
Accustomed was he, in the manner of Alan, to be swift;<BR>
Accustomed was he before a horde of depredators to make a descent;<BR>
Accustomed was the son of Golystan, though he was<BR>
A sovereign, to listen to what his father said;<BR>
Accustomed was he, in the interest of Mynyddawg, to have a perforated shield,<BR>
And a ruddy lance, before the vigorous chief of Eiddyn.</P>
<P>XXIV. The rulers did not celebrate the praise of the holy one.<BR>
Before the attack of the numerous host, the battle was broken through.<BR>
Like a raging fire through combustibles.<BR>
On Tuesday, they put on their splendid robes;<BR>
On Wednesday, bitter was their assembly;<BR>
On Thursday, messengers formed contracts;<BR>
On Friday, there were carnage and contusion;<BR>
On Saturday, they dealt mutual blows;<BR>
On Sunday, they were pierced by ruddy weapons;<BR>
On Monday, a pool of blood, knee-deep, was seen.<BR>
The Gododin, after tedious toil, cannot relate it.<BR>
Before the tents of Madawg after the return.</P>
<P>XXV. A grievous descent was made in front of the hoarded riches;<BR>
The first to chase them was a person renowned for activity;--<BR>
Gwannannon, honoured in the mead banquet, whose prowess I will extol;<BR>
And next to him the brave-minded and heroic<BR>
Eithinyn the renowned, the son of Bodw.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_424"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 424</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXVI. Men of excess went with them,<BR>
Who had been revelling in wine and mead,<BR>
In the banquet of Mynyddawg.<BR>
We are greatly grieved at the loss<BR>
Of a man of such terrible energy;<BR>
Like thunder from heaven was the clashing of his shield,<BR>
From the agitation caused by Eithinyn;</P>
<P>XXVII. Swift and heroic he was when at early dawn<BR>
He would arise to lead his band;<BR>
But whether leading or following<BR>
Before a hundred he stood prominent.<BR>
He was so disposed to (assault) them,<BR>
As to drink mead or wine;<BR>
He was so unsparing,<BR>
When he transfixed the foes,<BR>
And forward was his course towards them.</P>
<P>XXVIII. Rapidly and heroically with the dawn they marched<BR>
To the conflict, with the commander in front of the course;<BR>
Gwair was greeted by the fluid gore<BR>
In the van of the battle;<BR>
He was a beloved friend<BR>
In the day of distress.<BR>
The defence of the mountain, the place,<BR>
And the forward beam of war, wore a murky hue.</P>
<P>XXIX. His lances were seen among the hosts<BR>
Vigorously employed for mutual defence against the foe;<BR>
Before the din of his shields they concealed themselves, <A NAME="page_425"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 425</FONT></A><BR>
They lay hid before Eiddyn, the lofty hill;<BR>
And of as many as he found none returned;<BR>
Of him the truth is related and sung:<BR>
Obstinately would he pierce armour, when he caused a trembling;<BR>
And he whom he pierced, would not be pierced again.<BR>
Repeated are the lamentations that his presents are gone;<BR>
His friends were as numerous as bees;<BR>
And before he was covered under the sward of the earth,<BR>
He caused the mead to flow.</P>
<P>XXX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>Five lines untranslated</I>.)<BR>
The Gododin will not relate at the early dawn<BR>
Of any to whom Cynaval was not equal.</P>
<P>XXXI. Blade weapons, broad and ruddy, were abundant before he was covered,<BR>
The hero who filled the plain with slaughtered men.<BR>
He was a joyous chief, an unflinching wolf-like hero, a firm wolf<BR>
In the camp, with a submissive retinue blessing him;<BR>
Before he was arrested, he was not feeble.<BR>
Perfect art thou called from thy righteous deed;<BR>
Leader, director, and bulwark of all that are of the same language,<BR>
Tudvwlch, the subduer in battle, the destroyer of Caers.</P>
<P>XXXII. The slayer of hosts is gone to the black glebe:<BR>
A piece of earth has made<BR>
Sweet bitter to the people.<BR>
Withered leaves are driven too and fro on his patrimony; <A NAME="page_426"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 426</FONT></A><BR>
It was not for the advantage of the country that the sod (should cover him);<BR>
The bull of conflict never retreated the width of an acre.<BR>
Sad is the fate that it should thus be!</P>
<P>XXXIII. He pierced upwards of three hundred of the foe,<BR>
He slaughtered the centre and the extreme;<BR>
He was worthy to be at the head of an army, most gentle;<BR>
He fed his horses upon barley in winter,<BR>
Black ravens croaked on the wall<BR>
Of the beautiful Caer. He was an Arthur<BR>
In the midst of the exhausting conflict,<BR>
In the assault in the pass, like Gwernor the hero.</P>
<P>XXXIV. I ought to sing to Cynon with the flesh-spears:<BR>
In action, and before the desolating spears of Aeron,<BR>
His hand was reckoned at the head of hoary heroes.<BR>
To me was distributed the best fare among the daring ones,<BR>
To the advantage of Mynyddawg, knight of the people,<BR>
He appointed me to harass the enemy<BR>
On Catraeth, where the golden-torqued heroes were loquacious.<BR>
They pierced and slaughtered those who stood before them;<BR>
Whelps committed ravages about their territories.<BR>
There was scarcely in the lists, on the part of the Brython,<BR>
At Gododin, from a distance a man better than Cenon.</P>
<P>XXXV. It is incumbent on me to celebrate the complete acquisition<BR>
Of our warriors, who around Catraeth made a tumultuous rout, <A NAME="page_427"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 427</FONT></A><BR>
With confusion, and blood, and treading, and trampling,<BR>
Where valour was trampled, and vengeance taken because of the contribution of mead.<BR>
As to the carnage of the combatants,<BR>
Cibno does not relate after the excitement of battle.<BR>
Since he has received the communion he shall be interred.</P>
<P>XXXVI. Birds were allured (<I>untranslated</I>).<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>One line untranslated</I>.)<BR>
He put on gold before the battle-shout, in the front rank of the accomplished heroes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>Three lines untranslated</I>.)<BR>
Cibno the son of Gwengad had a long and splendid retinue.</P>
<P>XXXVII. I owe a complete song to the dog of Gwerunyd.<BR>
Let joy be in the chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P>
