<P>I. TRULY there will be to me a Roman friend.<BR>
Possibly from the son of another man he will cause<BR>
Before him that he heard the expanding tumult.<BR>
And an army and flow of blood on his enemy.<BR>
And let horses sound, and the multitude (be) merciful.<BR>
They would cut, they would greatly assemble in the sword of conflict.<BR>
Ravens and eagles adore blood.<BR>
The ruddy path of the violent bear is fearless.<BR>
Let Cadwaladyr rise ardent and gleaming<BR>
On the face of the embattled hosts of vigorous countries.</P>
<P>II. Truly there will be to me a day-share of frailties,<BR>
A vow of prophecy in the first beginning.<BR>
Years victorious, an excess of extensive rights.<BR>
When winter overspreads, sharp the steering of ships.<BR>
Confined the flow of harmony, courteous, respiring.<BR>
Glorious the appearance of the torrent on the top of the waves.<BR>
The swans resort round the morsel on the face of the surges.<BR>
Bear and lion empty the bright pools.<BR>
The boundary depends upon crimson spears.<BR>
Too much is sought chastisement, a caution to the fronts.<BR>
Before his ranks and great possessions,<BR>
Creeds fall, collars are broken by the crowds in front.<BR>
To the combat of Cadwaladyr, of splendidly-read fame,<BR>
There arose a dragon from the south,<BR>
By a free youth he was slain on a Thursday.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_445"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 445</FONT></A></P>
<P>III. Truly there will be to me bounteous heroism,<BR>
A royal eulogy of fame of great abundance.<BR>
A path thick, abundant, broad its form.<BR>
Until there be seven languages to the king of Gwynedd,<BR>
Until exhausting tumult passes away,<BR>
A king fond of a sleepless covering,<BR>
Violence on Angles, and a journey to banishment,<BR>
Through a sea will glide their offspring.</P>
<P>IV. Truly there will be to me one having a right to Mona.<BR>
Glorious the protection of the dragon to the people of the Brython.<BR>
Chief of armies, a respecter of breastplated men.<BR>
Deep, the prophecy divine of the Druids.<BR>
They would pitch their tents on Tren and Taranhon.<BR>
They would lie in ambush, to take Mona.<BR>
Far to go away be it a length from Iwerdon.<BR>
Fair the honour to liberate the C&aelig;sarians.</P>
<P>V. Predict a scene of unlovely discord.<BR>
I know when a battle was caused over wine and mead<BR>
A bear from Deheubarth barking at Gwynedd.<BR>
Defending too long wonderful superfluity.<BR>
Its fortified uplands were prepared,<BR>
On the calends of winter placing lands.<BR>
The mutual reflection on shields in the shout of the sword,<BR>
To the combat of Cadwaladyr on the lord of Gwynedd.</P>
<P>VI. Truly it will come, this will come to pass.<BR>
All Lloegyr will lose their possessions by us.<BR>
Seeing the aspects of the speckled white men,<BR>
Between the shafts of arrows and white iron,<BR>
A shouting on the sea, a lance-darting trembling of slaughter-- <A NAME="page_446"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 446</FONT></A><BR>
They will languish in the ocean, beyond the broad lake,<BR>
Sea and isles will be their gain.</P>
<P>VII. Truly there will come to me from beyond Hafren<BR>
Repelled of Prydein, a king of destiny.<BR>
A mild ruler of armies, numerous his progeny.<BR>
A kingdom suitable, hateful from ice.<BR>
The common people of the world truly will be joyful.<BR>
They possess energies, a tribe of rich men.<BR>
The flash flamed over the region of Hafren.<BR>
Let the Cymry be collected splendidly<BR>
To the combat of Cadwaladyr; be joyful<BR>
The chief minstrels with the glory of the battle.</P>
<P>VIII. Truly he will come<BR>
With his host and ships,<BR>
And searing shields,<BR>
And changing lances,<BR>
And after a valiant shout,<BR>
His will&nbsp;will be done.<BR>
May the circle of Prydein<BR>
Be enflamed there.<BR>
The dragon will not hide himself,<BR>
However many may come.<BR>
Not light the praise<BR>
Of conquering Dyved.<BR>
He will bear likewise<BR>
Over the effusions of Reged.<BR>
The creator, possessor of treasure,<BR>
Generous, daring his flow,<BR>
Immense his battle.<BR>
By airing the skin<BR>
Of Cadwaladyr, an active work.</P>
