<P>MAY God exalt over the community of Brython<BR>
The sign of gladness of a host from Mona,<BR>
There is a contention among the active patriots of Gwynedd.<BR>
Of bright radiancy, from every battle to have pledges,.<BR>
Powys will become grave in embraces.<BR>
Men, great-craving, will act on their laws.<BR>
Two hosts will go, they will be consonant.<BR>
Of one disposition, of one word, harmonious, compact.<BR>
They will divide justly the people of Ceredigiawn.<BR>
10 When thou seest men few about Llyn Aeron.<BR>
When will be heavy Tywi and Teivi rivers,<BR>
They will make battle in haste about Llys Llonion. <A NAME="page_433"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 433</FONT></A><BR>
What he saw he left over-laden.<BR>
He protected not cities from indignations.<BR>
A man warm, a man that guards, a man of impulse.<BR>
He was not an utterly clownish man, Rieddon.<BR>
When Cadwallawn came<BR>
Over the ocean of Iwerdon,<BR>
He regulated heaven as high creator.<BR>
20 Songsters, soon may I hear their cares,<BR>
An army of horsemen so harassing about Caer Llion,<BR>
And the revenge of Idwal on Aranwynyon,<BR>
And playing at ball with heads of Saxons.<BR>
There will be troubled the Cat Vreith and its strange language,<BR>
From the ford at Taradyr, as far as Porth Wygyr in Mona.<BR>
A youth brought them to Dinas Maon.<BR>
From the time when is defended the honey and clover<BR>
They leave their noise and contention,<BR>
30 Not unpledged to raise anger against enemies.<BR>
May God exalt over the community of Brython.</P>
