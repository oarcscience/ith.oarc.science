<P ALIGN="CENTER">HERE NOW BEGINNETH THE GORCHAN OF CYNVELYN.</P>
<P>WERE I to praise,<BR>
Were I to sing,<BR>
The Gwarchan would cause high shoots to spring,<BR>
Stalks like the collar of Trych Trwyth,<BR>
Monstrously savage, bursting and thrusting through,<BR>
When he was attacked in the river<BR>
Before his precious things.<BR>
Carn Gaffon burst through,<BR>
Before the cairns of Riwrhon,<BR>
10 Those that delighted in war,<BR>
Whose bones were short, their horsemen shorter.<BR>
Gylvach burst through<BR>
The assaults of heroism.<BR>
Fury against the Angles is just;<BR>
It is right to kill; it is right to crush those who are crushing.<BR>
Before the congenial splendour<BR>
There will be light for furthering the project,<BR>
And ability to descend<BR>
To every daring enterprise,<BR>
20 Through nail, through snare,<BR>
Through trapdoor, and fetters,<BR>
And gold spread abroad;<BR>
And deep sorrow will happen<BR>
To Gwynassedd the yellow.<BR>
His blood will be around him<BR>
Concealed will be the froth <A NAME="page_413"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 413</FONT></A><BR>
Of the splendid yellow mead;<BR>
Again there will be blood around him<BR>
Before the battles of Cynvelyn,--<BR>
30 From the indignation of Cynvelyn,<BR>
The uplifted pillar of wrath,<BR>
Food-provider for the birds.<BR>
With pendent stirrups<BR>
Will the graceful ones return,<BR>
Under the thigh of the heroes,<BR>
As swift as sprites move<BR>
On a pleasant lawn.<BR>
Sovereign of the land of song!<BR>
It is mine to lament him,<BR>
40 Until I come to the silent day!<BR>
The foe asked for<BR>
A long-handled weapon!<BR>
More powerful than the highly-honoured lays<BR>
Is the Gwarchan of Cynvelyn.<BR>
The Gorchan of Cynvelyn, to make the region weep.<BR>
A man of fortitude from Gwynedd has departed his country!<BR>
The brave are lamented;<BR>
Let the Caer of Eiddin deplore<BR>
The dread and illustrious men clothed in splendid blue.<BR>
50 Brilliant is thy ruddy gem--is it not precious?<BR>
Flowing panegyric is due to the horses<BR>
Of Eithinyn--are they not splendid?<BR>
The Gwarchan of Cynvelyn on Gododin!<BR>
Has he not, for a man, performed a reasonable part?<BR>
His heavy spear, adorned with gold, he bestowed on me;<BR>
Be it for the benefit of his soul!<BR>
His son Tegvan shall be honoured<BR>
In numbering and in partitioning, the grandson of Cadvan,<BR>
The pillar of ardency.<BR>
60 When weapons were hurled <A NAME="page_414"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 414</FONT></A><BR>
Over the heads of battle-wolves,<BR>
Soon would he come in the day of distress.<BR>
Three men and three score and three hundred<BR>
To the conflict of Catraeth went forth;<BR>
Of those who hastened<BR>
From the mead of the cup-bearers, three only returned,--<BR>
Cynon, and Cadreith, and Cadlew of Cadnant;<BR>
And me, on account of my blood they deplored,<BR>
Son of the omen pile, my ransom they contributed,<BR>
70 Of pure gold, and steel, and silver.<BR>
For their heroism they received no protection.<BR>
The Gwarchan of Cynvelyn will celebrate their contribution.</P>
