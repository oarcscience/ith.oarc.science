<P>I. KEEN is the gale, bare the hill,<BR>
It is difficult to find a shelter;<BR>
The ford is turbid, frozen is the lake,<BR>
A man stands firm with one stalk.</P>
<P>II. Wave after wave rolls towards the shore;<BR>
Loud the shoutings in front of the heights of the hill,<BR>
If one but just stands out.</P>
<P>III. Cold is the place of the lake-before the winter storm;<BR>
Dry the stalks of broken reeds;<BR>
Lucky is he who sees the wood in the chest.</P>
<P>IV. Cold is the bed of fish in the shelter of a sheet of ice;<BR>
Lean the stag; the topmost reeds move quickly;<BR>
Short the evening; bent the trees.</P>
<P>V. Let the white snow fall in deposits;<BR>
Warriors will not leave their duty;<BR>
Cold are the lakes without the appearance of warmth.</P>
<P>VI. Let the white snow fall on the boar frost;<BR>
Idle is the shield on the shoulder of the aged;<BR>
The wind is very high; it has certainly frozen.</P>
<P>VII. Let the snow fall on the surface of the ice;<BR>
Gently sweeps the wind the tops of thick trees;<BR>
Firm is the shield on the shoulder of the brave.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A></P>
<P>VIII. Let the snow descend and cover the vale<BR>
Warriors will hasten to battle;<BR>
I shall not go;--infirmity will not let me!</P>
<P>IX. Let the snow fall from the side of the slope<BR>
Prisoner is the steed, lean the cattle<BR>
Cold is no pleasure to-day.</P>
<P>X. Let the snow fall; white is the mountain-region;<BR>
Bare the timber of the ship on sea;<BR>
A host of men will cherish many counsels.</P>
<P>XI. Golden hands are around the horns, the horns in agitation;<BR>
Cold the stream, bright the sky,<BR>
Short the evening, bending are the tops of trees.</P>
<P>XII. The bees (live) on their store; small the clamour of birds,<BR>
The day is dewless;<BR>
The hill-top is a conspicuous object; red the dawn.</P>
<P>XIII. The bees are under cover; cold also is the ford,<BR>
Let the frost freeze as long as it lasts:<BR>
To him that is soft may dissolution happen!</P>
<P>XIV. The bees are in confinement this very day;<BR>
How withered the stalks, hard the slope;<BR>
Cold and dewless is the earth to-day.</P>
<P>XV. The bees are in shelter from the wet of winter;<BR>
Blue the mist, hollow the cow-parsnip;<BR>
Cowardliness is a bad quality in a man.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_323"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 323</FONT></A></P>
<P>XVI. Long the night, bare the moor, hoary the cliff;<BR>
Gray the fair gull on the precipice;<BR>
Rough the seas; there will be rain to-day.</P>
<P>XVII. Dry the wind, wet the road,<BR>
The vale assumes its former appearance.</P>
<P>XVIII. Cold the thistle-stalks; lean the stag;<BR>
Smooth the river; there will be fine weather.</P>
<P>XIX. Foul the weather on the mountain; the rivers troubled;<BR>
Flood will wet the ground in towns;<BR>
The earth looks like the ocean!</P>
<P>XX. Thou art not a scholar, thou art not a recluse;<BR>
Thou wilt not be called a monarch in the day of necessity.<BR>
Alas! Cynddilig, that thou wert not a woman!</P>
<P>XXI. Let the crooked hart bound at the top of the sheltered vale;<BR>
May the ice be broken; bare are the lowlands;<BR>
The brave escapes from many a hardship.</P>
<P>XXII. The thrush has a spotted breast,<BR>
Spotted the breast of the thrush;<BR>
The edge of the bank is broken<BR>
By the hoof of the lean, crooked, and stooping hart.</P>
<P>XXIII. Very high is the loud-sounding wind;<BR>
It is scarcely right for one to stand out.</P>
<P>XXIV. At All-Saints it is habitual for the heath-tops to be dun;<BR>
High-foaming is the sea-wave,<BR>
Short the day:--Druid, your advice!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXV. If the shield, and the vigour of the steed,<BR>
And of brave, fearless men, have gone to sleep,<BR>
The night is fair to chase the foe.</P>
<P>XXVI. The wind is supreme; sore and bare the trees,<BR>
Withered the reeds; the hart is bounding;<BR>
Pelis the False, what land is this?</P>
<P>XXVII. If it poured down snow as far as Arvwl Melyn,<BR>
Gloom would not make me sad;<BR>
I would lead a host to the hill of Tydwl.</P>
<P>XXVIII. For thou knowest, with equal ease, the causeway,<BR>
The ford, and the ascent, if snow were to fall,<BR>
When thou, Pelis, art our guide.</P>
<P>XXX. Anxiety in Prydain will not cause me to-night<BR>
To march upon a region where there is the greatest wailing,<BR>
From following after Owain.</P>
<P>XXXI. Since thou bearest arms and shield upon thee,<BR>
Defender of the destructive battle,<BR>
Pelis, in what land wast thou fostered?</P>
<P>XXXI. The man whom God releases from a very close prison,<BR>
Ruddy will be his spear from the territory of Owain,<BR>
Lavish of his entertainments.</P>
<P>XXXII. Since the chieftain is gone to earth,<BR>
Pursue not his family;<BR>
After mead seek no disgrace.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXXIII. The morning with the dawn of day,<BR>
When Mwg Mawr Drefydd was assaulted,<BR>
The steeds of Mechydd were not trained up.</P>
<P>XXXIV. Joy will be to me of no benefit,<BR>
Owing to the news which apprises me<BR>
That a wooden cover is upon Mechydd!</P>
<P>XXXV. They met around Cavall;<BR>
A corpse is there in blood through injustice,<BR>
From the rencounter of Rhun and the other hero.</P>
<P>XXXVI. For the staffers of Mwg have slain Mechydd;<BR>
Drudwas did not perceive the day;<BR>
Creator of heaven! thou hast caused me severe affliction!</P>
<P>XXXVII. Men are in the shout (of war); the ford is frozen over;<BR>
Cold the wave, variegated the bosom of the sea;<BR>
The eternal God give us counsel!</P>
<P>XXXVIII. Mechydd, the son of Llywarch, the undaunted chief,<BR>
Fine and fair was his robe of the colour of the swan,<BR>
The first that fastened a horse by the bridle.</P>
