<P>O little pig! thou happy little pig!<BR>
Bury not thy snout on the top of the mountain;<BR>
Burrow in a secluded place in the woods,<BR>
For fear of the hunting dogs of Rydderch, the champion of the faith. <A NAME="page_483"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 483</FONT></A><BR>
And I will prognosticate, and it will be true,<BR>
As far as Aber Taradyr, before the usurpers of Prydein,<BR>
All the Cymry will be under the same warlike leader;<BR>
His name is Llywelyn, of the line<BR>
Of Gwynedd, one who will overcome.</P>
<P>II. Listen, O little pig! it is necessary to go,<BR>
For fear of the hunters of Mordei, if one dared,<BR>
Lest we be pursued and discovered;<BR>
And should we escape, I shall not complain of fatigue,<BR>
And. I will predict, in respect of the ninth wave,<BR>
And in respect of the single white-bearded person, who exhausted Dyved,<BR>
Who erected a chancel in the land for those of partial belief,<BR>
In the upland region, and among wild beasts.<BR>
Until Cynan comes to it, to see its distress,<BR>
Her habitations will never be restored.</P>
<P>III. Listen, O little pig! I cannot easily sleep,<BR>
On account of the tumult of grief which is upon me;<BR>
Ten years and forty have I endured pain;<BR>
Evil is the joy which I now have.<BR>
May life be given me by Jesus, the most trustworthy<BR>
Of the kings of heaven, of highest lineage!<BR>
It will not be well with the female descendants of Adam,<BR>
If they believe not in God, in the latter day.<BR>
I have seen Gwenddoleu, with the precious gifts of princes,<BR>
Gathering prey from every extremity of the land;<BR>
Beneath my green sod is he not still!<BR>
The chief of sovereigns of the North, of mildest disposition.</P>
<P>IV. Listen, O little pig! it was necessary to pray,<BR>
For fear of the five sovereigns from Normandi;<BR>
And the fifth going over the salt sea, <A NAME="page_484"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 484</FONT></A><BR>
To conquer Iwerdon with its pleasant towns;<BR>
He will cause war and confusion,<BR>
And ruddy arms and groanings in it.<BR>
And they, certainly, will come from it,<BR>
And do honour on the grave of Dewi.<BR>
And I will predict that there will be confusion<BR>
From the fighting of son and father, the country shall know it;<BR>
And that there will be to the Lloegrians the falling of cities,<BR>
And that deliverance will never be to Normandi.</P>
<P>V. Listen, O little pig! be not drowsy;<BR>
There comes to us a sad report<BR>
Of petty chieftains full of perjury<BR>
And husbandmen. that are close-fisted of the penny.<BR>
When there shall come over the sea men completely covered with armour,<BR>
With war-horses under them, having two faces,<BR>
And two points on their terribly destructive spears;<BR>
There will be ploughing without reaping in the world of war;<BR>
The grave will be better than life to all the wretched;<BR>
Horns will be on the women of the four quarters;<BR>
When the vigorous young men shall become corpses,<BR>
There will be a severe morning in Caer Sallawg.</P>
<P>VI. Listen, O little pig! thou pig of peace!<BR>
A Sibyl has told me a wonderful tale;<BR>
And I will predict a summer full of fury,<BR>
Between brothers, treachery from Gwynedd.<BR>
When a pledge of peace shall long be required from the land of Gwynedd,<BR>
There shall come seven hundred ships of the Gynt with the north wind;<BR>
And in Aber Dau their conference will be.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_435"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 435</FONT></A></P>
<P>VII. Listen, O little pig! thou blessed little pig!<BR>
A Sibyl has told me it tale which frightens me;<BR>
When Lloegyr shall encamp in the land of Ethlin,<BR>
And make Dyganwy a strong fort,<BR>
By the . . . of Lloegyr and Llywelyn,<BR>
There will be it child on the shoulders . . . baggage.<BR>
When Deinoel, the son of Dunawd Deinwyn, becomes enraged,<BR>
The Frank shall flee the way he does not seek;<BR>
In Aber Dulas their support will be exhausted,<BR>
Of a ruddy hue will be their garments around them.</P>
<P>VIII. Listen, O little pig! listen to the calls for attention!<BR>
For the crime of the necessitous God will make remissions.<BR>
. . . what is becoming, be it mine,<BR>
And what is . . . let him seek.</P>
<P>IX. Listen, O little pig! it is broad daylight,<BR>
Hark thou to the song of water-birds whose notes are loud!<BR>
To us there will be years and long days,<BR>
And iniquitous rulers, and the blasting of fruit,<BR>
And bishops sheltering thieves, churches desecrated,<BR>
And monks who will compensate for loads of sins.</P>
<P>X. Listen, O little pig! penetrate into Gwynedd;<BR>
Have a partner when thou goest to rest.<BR>
Little does Rydderch Hael know to-night at his feast<BR>
What sleeplessness last night I bore.<BR>
The snow was up to my knee, owing to the wariness of the chief,<BR>
Icicles hung to my hair; sad is my fate! <A NAME="page_486"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 486</FONT></A><BR>
Tuesday will come, the day of fierce anger,<BR>
Between the ruler of Powys, and the region of Gwynedd.<BR>
When the beam of light will arise from its long repose,<BR>
And defend from its enemy the frontiers of Gwynedd.<BR>
Unless my Maker will grant me a share of his mercy,<BR>
Woe to me that I have existed, miserable will be my end!</P>
<P>XI. Listen, O little pig! utter not a whisper,<BR>
When the host of war marches from Caermarthen,<BR>
To support, in the common cause, two whelps<BR>
Of the line of Rys, the stay of battle, the warlike commander of armies,<BR>
When the Saxon shall be slain in the conflict of Cymmerau,<BR>
Blessed will be the lot of Cymry, the people of Cymrwy.</P>
<P>XII. Listen, O little pig! blessed little pig of the country!<BR>
Do not sleep in the morning, burrow not in the fertile region,<BR>
Lest Rydderch Hael and his cunning dogs should come,<BR>
And before thou couldst reach the wood, thy perspiration trickled down.</P>
<P>XIII. Listen, O little pig! thou blessed pig!<BR>
Hadst thou seen as much severe oppression as I have,<BR>
Thou wouldst not sleep in the morning, nor burrow on the hill.<BR>
When the Saxons repose from their serpent cunning,<BR>
And the castle of Collwyn is resorted to from afar,<BR>
Clothes will be smart, and the black pool clear.</P>
<P>XIV. Listen, O little pig! hear thou now;<BR>
When the men of Gwynedd lay down their great work,<BR>
Blades will be in hands, horns will be sounded, <A NAME="page_487"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 487</FONT></A><BR>
Armour will be broken before sharp lances.<BR>
And I will predict that two rightful princes<BR>
Will produce peace from heaven to earth--<BR>
Cynan, Cadwaladyr, thorough Cymry.<BR>
May their councils be admired.<BR>
The laws of the country, and the exclusion of troubles,<BR>
And the abolition of armies and theft;<BR>
And to us then there shall be a relief after our ills,<BR>
And from generosity none will be excluded.</P>
<P>XV. Listen, Q little pig! is not the mountain green?<BR>
My cloak is thin for me there is no repose;<BR>
Pale is my visage, Gwendydd does not come to me.<BR>
When the men of Bryneich will bring their army to the shore,<BR>
Cymry will conquer, glorious will be their day.</P>
<P>XVI. Listen, O little pig! thou brawny pig!<BR>
Bury not thy snout, consume not Mynwy;<BR>
Love no pledge, love no play.<BR>
And an advice I will give to Gwenabwy,<BR>
"Be not an amorous youth given to wanton play."<BR>
And I will predict the battle of Machawy,<BR>
When there will be ruddy spears. in the Riw Dydmwy,<BR>
From the contention of chieftains; breast will heave on the saddles;<BR>
There will be a morning of woe, and a woeful visitation;<BR>
A bear from Deheubarth will arise,<BR>
His men will spread over the land of Mynwy.<BR>
Blessed is the lot that awaits Gwendydd,<BR>
When the Prince of Dyved comes to rule,</P>
<P>XVII. Listen, O little pig! are not the buds of thorns<BR>
Very green, the mountain beautiful, and beautiful the earth? <A NAME="page_488"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 488</FONT></A><BR>
And I will predict the battle of Coed Llwyvein,<BR>
And ruddy biers from the attack of Owein,<BR>
When stewards shall make short disputes,<BR>
When there will be perjury and treachery amongst the children of the land;<BR>
And When Cadwaladyr comes to conquer<BR>
Mona, the Saxons shall be extirpated from lovely Prydein.</P>
<P>XVIII. Listen, O little pig! great wonders<BR>
Will be in Prydein, and I shall not be concerned;<BR>
When come the inhabitants of the regions about<BR>
Mona to question the Brython, there will be troublesome times;<BR>
A successful leader will uplift radiant spears,<BR>
Stout Cynan, appearing from the banks of the Teiwi,<BR>
Will cause confusion in Dyved;<BR>
May there be to him for riches melody in it!</P>
<P>XIX. Listen, O little pig! how wonderful it is<BR>
That the world is never long in the same condition!<BR>
How far the Saxons proclaim the cause of strife<BR>
With the generous Brython, the sons of trouble!<BR>
And I will predict before the end<BR>
The Brython uppermost of the Saxons; the Picts say it;<BR>
And then will come upon its the spirit of joyfulness,<BR>
After having long been of a tardy disposition.</P>
<P>XX. Listen, O little pig! hear thou the melody<BR>
And chirping of birds by Caer Reon.<BR>
One I have that I would place on Mynydd Maon,<BR>
To view the comely forms of the lovely ones.<BR>
And I will predict a battle on the wave,<BR>
And the battle of Machawy, and a battle on a river, <A NAME="page_489"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 489</FONT></A><BR>
Ant] the battle of Cors Vochno, and the battle of Minron,<BR>
And the battle of Cymminawd, and the battle of Caerlleon,<BR>
And the battle of Abergwaith, and the battle of Ieithion;<BR>
And when there shall be an end of music at the land's end;<BR>
A child will arise, and good there will be to the Brython.</P>
<P>XXI. Listen, O little pig! a period will come,<BR>
How miserable that it should come, but come it will!<BR>
Maids will be bold, and wives wanton;<BR>
They will love, but will not revere their kindred;<BR>
Liberal will not the prosperous be towards one another.<BR>
Bishops will be of a different language, worthless, and faithless.</P>
<P>XXII. Listen, O little pig! thou little speckled one!<BR>
List to the voice of sea-birds, great is their energy!<BR>
Minstrels will be out, without their appropriate portion;<BR>
Though they stand at the door, a reward will not come,<BR>
I was told by a sea-gull that had come from afar,<BR>
That strange sovereigns will make their appearance;<BR>
Gwyddyl, and Brython, and Romani<BR>
Will create discord and confusion,<BR>
And in the name of gods will come into it,<BR>
And vigorously fight on both banks of the Tywi.</P>
<P>XXIII. Listen, O little pig! thou stout-armed little one!<BR>
Hark to the voice of sea-birds, whose clamour is great.<BR>
Minstrels will be out, without an honourable portion,<BR>
There will be repugnance to hospitality; a youth will have his own opinion,<BR>
Without protection of countenance, without an honourable portion. <A NAME="page_490"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 490</FONT></A><BR>
When two brothers will be two Idases for land,<BR>
From their claim will be cherished a lasting feud.</P>
<P>XXIV. Listen, O little pig! to me it is of no purpose<BR>
To hear the voice of water-birds, whose scream is tumultuous,<BR>
Thin is the hair of my head, my covering is not warm;<BR>
The dales are my barn, my corn is not plenteous;<BR>
My summer collection affords me no relief,<BR>
Before parting from God, incessant was my passion.<BR>
And I will predict, before the end of the world,<BR>
Women without shame, and men without manliness.</P>
<P>XXV. Listen, O little pig! a trembling pig!<BR>
Thin is my covering, for me there is no repose,<BR>
Since the battle of Ardeleryd it will not concern me,<BR>
Though the sky were to fall, and sea to overflow.<BR>
And I will predict that after Henri<BR>
Such and such a king in troublesome times.<BR>
When there shall be a bridge on the Taw, and another on the Tywi,<BR>
There will be an end of war in it.</P>
