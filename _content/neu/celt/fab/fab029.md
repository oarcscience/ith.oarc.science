### XIII.

### THE BATTLE OF GODEU.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN VIII.

I HAVE been in a multitude of shapes,  
Before I assumed a consistent form.  
I have been a sword, narrow, variegated,  
I will believe when it is apparent. <span id="page_277">p. 277</span>  
I have been a tear in the air,  
I have been the dullest of stars.  
I have been a word among letters,  
I have been a book in the origin.  
I have been the light of lanterns  
10 A year and a half.  
I have been a continuing bridge,  
Over three score Abers.  
I have been a course, I have been an eagle.  
I have been a coracle in the seas:  
I have been compliant in the banquet.  
I have been a drop in a shower;  
I have been a sword in the grasp of the hand:  
I have been a shield in battle.  
I have been a string in a harp,  
20 Disguised for nine years.  
In water, in foam.  
I have been sponge in the fire,  
I have been wood in the covert.  
I am not he who will not sing of  
A combat though small,  
The conflict in the battle of Godeu of sprigs.  
Against the Guledig of Prydain,  
There passed central horses,  
Fleets full of riches.  
30 There passed an animal with wide jaws,  
On it there were a hundred heads.  
And a battle was contested  
Under the root of his tongue;  
And another battle there is  
In his *occiput*.  
A black sprawling toad,  
With a hundred claws on it.  
A snake speckled, crested. <span id="page_278">p. 278</span>  
A hundred souls through sin  
40 Shall be tormented in its flesh.  
I have been in Caer Vevenir,  
Thither hastened grass and trees,  
Minstrels were singing,  
Warrior-bands were wondering,  
At the exaltation of the Brython,  
That Gwydyon effected.  
There was a calling on the Creator,  
Upon Christ for causes,  
Until when the Eternal  
50 Should deliver those whom he had made.  
The Lord answered them,  
Through language and elements:  
Take the forms of the principal trees,  
Arranging yourselves in battle array,  
And restraining the public.  
Inexperienced in battle hand to band.  
When the trees were enchanted,  
In the expectation of not being trees,  
The trees uttered their voices  
60 From strings of harmony,  
The disputes ceased.  
Let us cut short heavy days,  
A female restrained the din.  
She came forth altogether lovely.  
The head of the line, the head was a female.  
The advantage of a sleepless cow  
Would not make us give way.  
The blood of men up to our thighs,  
The greatest of importunate mental exertions  
70 Sported in the world.  
And one has ended  
From considering the deluge, <span id="page_279">p. 279</span>  
And Christ crucified,  
And the day of judgment near at hand.  
The alder-trees, the head of the line,  
Formed the van.  
The willows and quicken-trees  
Came late to the army.  
Plum-trees, that are scarce,  
80 Unlonged for of men.  
The elaborate medlar-trees,  
The objects of contention.  
The prickly rose-bushes,  
Against a host of giants,  
The raspberry brake did  
What is better failed  
For the security of life.  
Privet and woodbine  
And ivy on its front,  
90 Like furze to the combat  
The cherry-tree was provoked.  
The birch, notwithstanding his high mind,  
Was late before he was arrayed.  
Not because of his cowardice,  
But on account of his greatness.  
The laburnum held in mind,  
That your wild nature was foreign.  
Pine-trees in the porch,  
The chair of disputation,  
100 By me greatly exalted,  
In the presence of kings.  
The elm with his retinue,  
Did not go aside a foot;  
He would fight with the centre,  
And the flanks, and the rear.  
Hazel-trees, it was judged <span id="page_280">p. 280</span>  
That ample was thy mental exertion.  
The privet, happy his lot,  
The bull of battle, the lord of the world.  
110 Morawg and Morydd  
Were made prosperous in pines.  
Holly, it was tinted with green,  
He was the hero.  
The hawthorn, surrounded by prickles,  
With pain at his hand.  
The aspen-wood has been topped,  
It was topped in battle.  
The fern that was plundered.  
The broom, in the van of the army,  
120 In the trenches he was hurt.  
The gorse did not do well,  
Notwithstanding let it overspread.  
The heath was victorious, keeping off on all sides.  
The common people were charmed,  
During the proceeding of the men.  
The oak, quickly moving,  
Before him, tremble heaven and earth.  
A valiant door-keeper against an enemy,  
His name is considered.  
130 The blue-bells combined,  
And caused a consternation.  
In rejecting, were rejected,  
Others, that were perforated.  
Pear-trees, the best intruders  
In the conflict of the plain.  
A very wrathful wood,  
The chestnut is bashful,  
The opponent of happiness,  
The jet has become black, <span id="page_281">p. 281</span>  
140 The mountain has become crooked,  
The woods have become a kiln,  
Existing formerly in the great seas,  
Since was heard the shout:--  
The tops of the birch covered us with leaves,  
And transformed us, and changed our faded state.  
The branches of the oak have ensnared us  
From the Gwarchan of Maelderw.  
Laughing on the side of the rock,  
The lord is not of an ardent nature.  
150 Not of mother and father,  
When I was made,  
Did my Creator create me.  
Of nine-formed faculties,  
Of the fruit of fruits,  
Of the fruit of the primordial God,  
Of primroses and blossoms of the hill,  
Of the flowers of trees and shrubs.  
Of earth, of an earthly course,  
When I was formed.  
160 Of the flower of nettles,  
Of the water of the ninth wave.  
I was enchanted by Math,  
Before I became immortal,  
I was enchanted by Gwydyon  
The great purifier of the Brython,  
Of Eurwys, of Euron,  
Of Euron, of Modron.  
Of five battalions of scientific ones,  
Teachers, children of Math.  
170 When the removal occurred,  
I was enchanted by the Guledig.  
When he was half-burnt,  
I was enchanted by the sage <span id="page_282">p. 282</span>  
Of sages, in the primitive world.  
When I had a being;  
When the host of the world was in dignity,  
The bard was accustomed to benefits.  
To the song of praise I am inclined, which the tongue recites.  
I played in the twilight,  
180 I slept in purple;  
I was truly in the enchantment  
With Dylan, the son of the wave.  
In the circumference, in the middle,  
Between the knees of kings,  
Scattering spears not keen,  
From heaven when came,  
To the great deep, floods,  
In the battle there will be  
Four score hundreds,  
190 That will divide according to their will.  
They are neither older nor younger,  
Than myself in their divisions.  
A wonder, Canhwr arc born, every one of nine hundred.  
He was with me also,  
With my sword spotted with blood.  
Honour was allotted to me  
By the Lord, and protection (was) where he was.  
If I come to where the boar was killed,  
He will compose, he will decompose,  
200 He will form languages.  
The strong-handed gleamer, his name,  
With a gleam he rules his numbers.  
They would spread out in a flame,  
When I shall go on high.  
I have been a speckled snake on the hill, <span id="page_283">p.
283</span>  
I have been a viper in the Llyn.  
I have been a bill-hook crooked that cuts,  
I have been a ferocious spear  
With my chasuble and bowl  
210 I will prophesy not badly,  
Four score smokes  
On every one what will bring.  
Five battalions of arms  
Will be caught by my knife.  
Six steeds of yellow hue  
A hundred times better is  
My cream-coloured steed,  
Swift as the sea-mew  
Which will not pass  
220 Between the sea and the shore.  
Am I not pre-eminent in the field of blood?  
Over it are a hundred chieftains.  
Crimson (is) the gem of my belt,  
Gold my shield border.  
There has not been born, in the gap,  
That has been visiting me,  
Except Goronwy,  
From the dales of Edrywy.  
Long white my fingers,  
230 It is long since I have been a herdsman.  
I travelled in the earth,  
Before I was a proficient in learning.  
I travelled, I made a circuit,  
I slept in a hundred islands.  
A hundred Caers I have dwelt in.  
Ye intelligent Druids,  
Declare to Arthur,  
What is there more early  
Than I that they sing of. <span id="page_284">p. 284</span>  
240 And one is come  
From considering the deluge,  
And Christ crucified,  
And the day of future doom.  
A golden gem in a golden jewel.  
I am splendid  
And shall be wanton  
From the oppression of the metal-workers.
