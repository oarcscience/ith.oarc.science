<P>IT broke out with matchless fury.<BR>
The rapid vehement fire.<BR>
Him we praise above the earth,<BR>
Fire, the fiery meteor of the dawn.<BR>
Above the high gale,<BR>
Higher than every cloud.<BR>
Great his animal.<BR>
He will not delay<BR>
Nor the wedding-feast of Llyr.<BR>
10. His path is like a water-course,<BR>
Thy rage in the chief streams.<BR>
The dawn smiles, repelling gloom,<BR>
At the dawn with violence,<BR>
At every meet season,<BR>
At the meet sea-son of his turnings,<BR>
At the four stages of his course,<BR>
I will extol him that judges violence,<BR>
Of the strong din, deep his wrath. <A NAME="page_308"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 308</FONT></A><BR>
I am not a man, cowardly, gray,<BR>
20. A scum, near the wattle.<BR>
The illusion of my two relatives,<BR>
Two groans of affliction without appetite.<BR>
From my hand to thy hand God will give naught.<BR>
Thrice three protections,<BR>
Returning to the old places,<BR>
With a steed used to the field.<BR>
And the steed of Genethawg,<BR>
And the steed of Caradawg,<BR>
Perfect for travelling.<BR>
30. And the steed of Gwythur,<BR>
And the steed of Gwarddur,<BR>
And the steed of Arthur.<BR>
Dauntless to cause an ache,<BR>
And the steed of Taliessin,<BR>
And the steed of Lleu half domesticated,<BR>
And of Pebyr, the dark gray of the grove.<BR>
And Grei, the steed of Cunin.<BR>
Cornan stubborn in the conflict,<BR>
Of ardent desires,<BR>
40. The Black, from the seas famous,<BR>
The steed of Brwyn, betrayer of the country.<BR>
And the three cloven-footed ones<BR>
They will not go a journey conveniently,<BR>
The terrible steed of Ceidaw,<BR>
A hoof with bribery on it.<BR>
Mottle-shouldered Ysgodig<BR>
The steed of Llemenig<BR>
The horse of Rhydderch Rhyddig<BR>
Of the gray colour of a pear.<BR>
50. And Llamre, full of inherent vigour,<BR>
And Froenvoll of a vigorous growth,<BR>
The steed of Sadyrnin, <A NAME="page_309"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 309</FONT></A><BR>
And the steed of Constantine.<BR>
And others handling,<BR>
For the country, the smart of foreigners.<BR>
The good Henwyn brought<BR>
A tale from Hiraddug.<BR>
I have been a sow, I have been a buck,<BR>
I have been a sage, I have been a snout,<BR>
60. I have been a horn, I have been a wild sow,<BR>
I have been a shout in battle.<BR>
I have been a torrent on the slope,<BR>
I have been a wave on the extended shore.<BR>
I have been the light sprinkling of a deluge,<BR>
I have been a cat with a speckled head on three trees.<BR>
I have been a circumference, I have been a head.<BR>
A goat on an elder-tree.<BR>
I have been a crane well filled, a sight to behold.<BR>
Very ardent the animals of Morial,<BR>
70. They kept a good stock.<BR>
Of what is below the air, say the hateful men,<BR>
Too many do not live, of those-that know me.</P>
