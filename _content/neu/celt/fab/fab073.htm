Very numerous I see<BR>

A hundred battles, and the breaking of a hundred Caers.</P>

In the extremity of the region of Penvro,<BR>

The lion with a numerous host,<BR>
Great the tumult, extremely harassing to the rear.</P>
<P>XVII. From the plotting of strangers and iniquitous<BR>
Monks, as the water flows from the fountain,<BR>
Sad and heavy will be the day for Cadwallawn.</P>
<P>XVIII. The trees have put on the gay robes<BR>
Of summer; let wrath be hastened by fate;<BR>
Let us meet around Elved.</P>
