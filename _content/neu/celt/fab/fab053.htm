<P>THE men of Catraeth arose with the dawn,<BR>
About the Guledig, of work a profitable merchant.<BR>
This Urien, without mockery is his regret.<BR>
He sustains the sovereignty and its demands.<BR>
Warlike, the grandeur of a perfect prince of baptism.<BR>
The men of Prydain hurtful in battle array,<BR>
At Gwenystrad, continuously offerers of battle.<BR>
Protected neither the field nor woods<BR>
The people with shelter, when tribulation comes.<BR>
10 Like the wave loud roaring over the beach,<BR>
I saw valiant men in battle array,<BR>
And after the morning, battle-mangled flesh.<BR>
I saw a tumult of three limits slain,<BR>
A shout active in front was heard.<BR>
In defending Gwenystrad was seen<BR>
A mound and slanting ground obstructing.<BR>
In the pass of the ford I saw men gory-tinted,<BR>
Dropping their arms before the pallid miserable ones.<BR>
They join in peace as they were losers. <A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A><BR>
20 Hand on the cross they wail on the gravel bank of Garanwynyon.<BR>
The tribes revel over the rising wave.<BR>
The billows protect the hair of their captures.<BR>
I saw men of splendid progress<BR>
With blood that clotted on the garments,<BR>
Toiling energetically and incessantly in battle.<BR>
The covering battle, where there was no flight, when contrived.<BR>
The ruler of Reged, I am astonished at what was dared.<BR>
I saw a brow covered with rage on Urien,<BR>
When he furiously attacked his foes at the white stone<BR>
30 Of Galystem. His rage was a blade;<BR>
The bucklered men were sustained in need.<BR>
May a desire of battle come on Euirwyn.<BR>
And until I fail in old age,<BR>
In the sore necessity of death,<BR>
May I not be smiling,<BR>
If I praise not Urien.</P>
