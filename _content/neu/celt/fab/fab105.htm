<P>A BARD there is here, who has not sung, what he shall have to sing;<BR>
Lot him sing; when he shall have finished,<BR>
An astrologer then he may be.<BR>
The generous ones refuse me.<BR>
There will not be one that will give.<BR>
Through the language of Taliessin,<BR>
It was a bright day<BR>
When Kian did<BR>
Praise the multitude.<BR>
10 There will be a slaughter, let there be the speech of Avagddu.<BR>
But if he ingeniously brings<BR>
The requisites forward,<BR>
Gwiawn will declare,<BR>
O the deep that will come<BR>
He would make the dead alive,<BR>
And destitute of wealth he is.<BR>
They will not make their cauldrons, <A NAME="page_526"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 526</FONT></A><BR>
That will boil without fire.<BR>
They will make their metals<BR>
20 In age of ages.<BR>
Thy pace that bears thee<BR>
From the deep of panegyric,<BR>
Is it not the hostile confederacy?<BR>
What its custom?<BR>
So much of national song<BR>
Your tongue has given.<BR>
Why will ye not recite an oration<BR>
Of blessing over the liquor of brightness?<BR>
The theme of every one's rhapsody.<BR>
30 I shall be there according to custom,<BR>
He was a profound judge.<BR>
He came after his periodical custom,<BR>
The third of the equal judges.<BR>
Three score years<BR>
I have supported an earthly scene,<BR>
In the water of law and the multitude.<BR>
In the element of lands.<BR>
A hundred servants surrounded,<BR>
A hundred kings made vows.<BR>
40 A hundred they are that went,<BR>
A hundred they are that came.<BR>
A hundred minstrels sang,<BR>
And he foretold of them.<BR>
Lladdon, the daughter of the stream,<BR>
Little was her desire<BR>
For gold and silver,<BR>
Who is the living one that left her?<BR>
Blood on the breast;<BR>
He will probably be spoken of,<BR>
50 He will be greatly praised.<BR>
I am Taliessin, <BR>
I will delineate the true lineage<BR>
Continuing until the end,<BR>
In the pattern of Elphin,<BR>
Is not the tribute<BR>
Of counted gold a debt?<BR>
When is hated and not loved,<BR>
Perjury and treason,<BR>
I desire not advantage,<BR>
60 Through the fluctuation of our song.<BR>
The brother that freely greets,<BR>
From me no one shall know.<BR>
The wise man of the primary science,<BR>
The astrologer reasoned,<BR>
About wrath, about the resolvent,<BR>
About the man describing windings.<BR>
About men well versed in praise.<BR>
Let us proceed, God it is,<BR>
Through the language of Talhaearn,<BR>
70 Baptism was the day of judgment,<BR>
That judged the characteristics<BR>
Of the force of poetry.<BR>
He and his virtue gave<BR>
Inspiration without mediocrity,<BR>
Seven score Ogyrven<BR>
Are in the Awen.<BR>
Eight score, of every score it will be one.<BR>
In the deep it will cease from ire;<BR>
In the deep it will be excessively angry;<BR>
80 In the deep, below the earth;<BR>
In the sky, above the earth.<BR>
There is one that knows<BR>
What sadness is,<BR>
Better than joy.<BR>
I know the law of the graces of <A NAME="page_528"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 528</FONT></A><BR>
The Awen, when it flows,<BR>
Concerning skilful payments,<BR>
Concerning happy days,<BR>
Concerning a tranquil life,<BR>
90 Concerning the protection of ages.<BR>
Concerning what beseems kings; how long their consolation.<BR>
Concerning similar things, that are on the face of the earth.<BR>
Magnificent astronomy, when communicated,<BR>
Sees all that is high.<BR>
When the mind is active,<BR>
When the sea is pleasant,<BR>
When the race is valiant,<BR>
When the high one is supplicated,<BR>
Or the sun when it is given,<BR>
100 When it covers the land.<BR>
Covering land of what extent?<BR>
When was drawn the bird of wrath,<BR>
The bird of wrath when it was drawn.<BR>
When the earth is green.<BR>
Who chaunted songs?<BR>
Songs who chaunted?<BR>
If true, who has considered them?<BR>
It has been considered in books,<BR>
110 How many winds, how many streams,<BR>
How many streams, how many winds.<BR>
How many rivers in their courses,<BR>
How many rivers there are.<BR>
The earth, what its breadth;<BR>
Or what its thickness.<BR>
I know the noise of the blades,<BR>
Crimson on all sides, about the floor.<BR>
I know the regulator, <A NAME="page_529"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 529</FONT></A><BR>
Between heaven and earth;<BR>
120 When an opposite hill is echoing,<BR>
When devastation urges onward,<BR>
When the silvery (vault) is shining,<BR>
When the dell shall be gloomy.<BR>
The breath when it is black,<BR>
When is best that has been.<BR>
A cow, when it is horned,<BR>
A wife, when she is lovely,<BR>
Milk, when it is white,<BR>
When the holly is green,<BR>
130 When is bearded the kid<BR>
In the multitude of fields,<BR>
When it is bearded,<BR>
When the cow-parsnip is created,<BR>
When is revolving the wheel,<BR>
When the mallet is flat,<BR>
When is spotted the little roebuck,<BR>
When the salt is brine,<BR>
Ale, when it is of an active quality.<BR>
When is of purplish hue the alder.<BR>
140 When is green the linnet,<BR>
When are red the hips,<BR>
Or a woman when restless,<BR>
When the night comes on.<BR>
What reserve there is in the hour of flowing,<BR>
No one knows whence the bosom of the sun is made ruddy.<BR>
A stain on a new garment,<BR>
It is difficult to remove it.<BR>
The string of a harp, why it complains,<BR>
The cuckoo, why it complains, why it sings.<BR>
150 Why keepeth the agreeable,<BR>
Why have led the camp <A NAME="page_530"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 530</FONT></A><BR>
Gereint and Arman.<BR>
What brings out the sparkle<BR>
From bard working of the stones.<BR>
When is sweet-smelling the goat's-beard plant;<BR>
When the crows are of a waxen line.<BR>
Talhayarn is<BR>
The greatest astronomer.<BR>
What is the imagination of trees.<BR>
160 From the muse the agreement of a day.<BR>
I know good and evil.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
The bowl of whom has flowed,<BR>
What dawn has finished,<BR>
Who preached,<BR>
Eli and Eneas:<BR>
I know the cuckoos of summer,<BR>
(Where) they will be in the winter.<BR>
170 The Awen I sing,<BR>
From the deep I bring it,<BR>
A river while it flows,<BR>
I know its extent;<BR>
I know when it disappears;<BR>
I know when it fills;<BR>
I know when it overflows;<BR>
I know when it shrinks;<BR>
I know what base<BR>
There is beneath the sea.<BR>
180 I know their equivalent,<BR>
Every one in its retinue;<BR>
How many were heard in a day,<BR>
How many days in a year.<BR>
How many shafts in a battle,<BR>
How many drops in a shower. <A NAME="page_531"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 531</FONT></A><BR>
Mildly he divided them.<BR>
A greater mockery, the partial stirring up of disgrace,<BR>
The vicious muse of Gwydyon.<BR>
I know the one,<BR>
190 That filled the river,<BR>
On the people of Pharaoh.<BR>
Who brought the windings<BR>
Of present reasons.<BR>
What was the active patience,<BR>
When heaven was upreared.<BR>
What was a sail-staff<BR>
From earth to sky.<BR>
How many fingers about the cauldron,<BR>
About one, about the hand,<BR>
200 What name the two words<BR>
Will not deliver in one cauldron.<BR>
When the sea is turning round,<BR>
When black are the fish.<BR>
Marine food shall be their flesh,<BR>
Until it is transformed,<BR>
When fish shall contain it.<BR>
When the foot of the white swan is black,<BR>
Four-sided the sharp spear.<BR>
The tribe of heaven will not put down.<BR>
210 Which are the four elements.<BR>
Their end is not known.<BR>
What pigs, or what wandering of stags.<BR>
I salute thee, Bard of the border.<BR>
May he increase thee, (whose) bones (are of) mist<BR>
(Where) two cataracts of wind fall.<BR>
My mind has been expressed<BR>
In Hebrew, in Hebraic.<BR>
In Hebraic, in Hebrew,<BR>
Laudatu Laudate Jesu. <A NAME="page_532"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 532</FONT></A><BR>
220 A second time was I formed.<BR>
I have been a blue salmon.<BR>
I have been a dog; I have been a stag;<BR>
I have been a roebuck on the mountain.<BR>
I have been a stock, I have been a spade;<BR>
I have been an axe in the hand;<BR>
I have been a pin in a forceps,<BR>
A year and a half;<BR>
I have been a speckled white cock<BR>
Upon hens in Eiddyn.<BR>
230 I have been a stallion over a stud.<BR>
I have been a violent bull,<BR>
I have been a buck of yellow hue,<BR>
As it is feeding.<BR>
I have been a grain discovered,<BR>
Which grew on a hill.<BR>
He that reaped me placed me,<BR>
Into a smoke-hole driving me.<BR>
Exerting of the hand,<BR>
In afflicting me,<BR>
240 A hen received me,<BR>
With ruddy claws, (and) parting comb.<BR>
I rested nine nights.<BR>
In her womb a child,<BR>
I have been matured,<BR>
I have been an offering before the Guledig,<BR>
I have been dead, I have been alive.<BR>
A branch there was to me of ivy,<BR>
I have been a convoy,<BR>
Before God I have been poor.<BR>
250 Again advised me the cherisher<BR>
With ruddy claws; of what she gave me<BR>
Scarcely can be recounted;<BR>
Greatly will it be praised. <A NAME="page_533"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 533</FONT></A><BR>
I am Taliessin,<BR>
I will delineate the true lineage,<BR>
That will continue to the end,<BR>
In the pattern of Elphin.</P>
