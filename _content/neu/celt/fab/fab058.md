### XLIII.

### THE SATISFACTION OF URIEN.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXIX.

THE lion will be most implacable;  
I will not deplore him.  
Urien I will approach,  
To him I will sing.  
When will come my surety,  
I shall obtain admission.  
Of the very best part,  
Under the flow of melody,  
It concerns me not much,  
10 The everlasting lineage which I see.  
I will not go to them, I will not be with them.  
I will not address the North  
And the kings of the plain.  
Though there should be for many  
That I should see a mutual pledging.  
I have no need of affection:  
Urien will not refuse me  
The lands of Llwyvenydd.  
Mine is their wealth,  
20 Mine are the festivals,  
Mine is the produce,  
Mine are the metals,  
And its rich productions.  
Mead out of buffalo-horns  
And good in abundance,  
From the best prince,  
The most generous that has been heard of. <span id="page_353">p.
353</span>  
The chiefs of every language  
To thee are all captive.  
30 For thee there will be lamentation when thy death is certain.  
Though I should have preferred him  
After being benefited, I would grow old.  
There was not one that I loved better,  
(Of those) that I knew before.  
At times I see  
The amount of what I shall have.  
Except to God supreme,  
I will not renounce  
Thy royal sons,  
40 The most generous of men,  
Their spears shall resound  
In the land of their enemies.  
And until I fail in old age,  
In the sore necessity of death,  
May I not be smiling,  
If I praise not Urien.
