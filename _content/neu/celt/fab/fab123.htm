Usual for a man to inquire after news.<BR>
Usual for a foster-child to have dainties.</P>
<P>II. Usual is wind from the east; usual for a man with swelling breast to be<BR>
Proud; usual for the thrush to be among thorns; <A NAME="page_572"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 572</FONT></A><BR>
Usual against oppression is an outcry;<BR>
Usual for crows to find flesh in a nook.</P>
<P>III. Usual is wind from the north; usual for maids to be<BR>
Lovely; usual, a handsome main in Gwynedd;<BR>
Usual for a prince to provide a feast;<BR>
Usual after drinking is derangement of the senses.</P>

Overflow; usual for a sow to breed vermin;<BR>
Usual for swine to turn up the ground for earth-nuts.</P>
<P>V. Usual is wind from the mountain; usual a plash<BR>
In the plain; usual to find thatch in the meadows<BR>
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
Usual are leaves, tender shoots, and trees.</P>
<P>VI. Usual an eagle's nest in the top of the oak,<BR>
And in the congress-house, men of renown;<BR>
The eye of the fond one is on whom he loves.</P>
<P>VII. Usual is the day with a. blazing fire in the hurried season<BR>
Of winter, with the eloquent men of spears;<BR>
Usual for the hearth of the faithless to be a desert.</P>

The commerce of the Saxon is with money;<BR>
Unhappy is the soul of the mother of unfaithful children.</P>

Woe to it as to its fate;<BR>
It is old--this year it was born.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_573"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 573</FONT></A></P>
<P>X. Though it may be small, yet ingeniously<BR>
Do the birds build in the summit of trees<BR>
Of equal age will be the good and the happy.</P>
<P>XI. Cold and wet is the mountain; cold and gray the ice;<BR>
Trust in God--he will not deceive thee;<BR>
Persevering patience will not leave thee long afflicted.</P>
