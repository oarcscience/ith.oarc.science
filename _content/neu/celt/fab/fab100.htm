<P>I. A BLESSING to the happy youth and to the fair kingdom!<BR>
Large is the wave, capacious the breast.<BR>
God is his name in the depth of every language.<BR>
Thou with energy didst overshadow the pure Mary;<BR>
Well hast Thou come in human form.<BR>
Behold here the Son of glorious hope,<BR>
Whose death proceeded from Idas.<BR>
He was, by his treachery and disgraceful conduct,<BR>
A deluder in the gentle service of his Lord;<BR>
Cunning was he, but he was not wise;<BR>
And until the judgment I know not his destination.<BR>
If a bard were every poet that is<BR>
On earth, on the brine and on the cultivated plain,<BR>
On the sand and on the seas, and in the stars of astronomy,<BR>
The giver with the gentle and ready hand being judge,<BR>
More than they could I should wish, and also do,<BR>
To relate the power and bounty of the Creator.<BR>
Great God! to-day is thy majesty extolled.</P>
<P>II. The blessing of the nine hosts of heaven on the mysterious<BR>
Creator, the mighty God and dominator,<BR>
Who has created the light of gladness,<BR>
And generous brightness of the sun in the day, <A NAME="page_517"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 517</FONT></A><BR>
Like the Christian's lamp, it shines above the deep,<BR>
A thousand times greater than the moon.<BR>
And a third wonder is, the agitation of the sea;<BR>
How it ebbs, how it swells,<BR>
How it goes, how it comes, how it rolls, how it settles;<BR>
How long will it go, or how will it be?<BR>
At the end of seven years,<BR>
The Creator will check its course,<BR>
Until it comes to its former state.<BR>
We will worship him who causes it, the mighty<BR>
God, the Son of Mary, who created heaven and earth.<BR>
When thou camest on Easter eve<BR>
From Uffern, what was thy portion became liberated;<BR>
Creator of heaven! may we purchase thy loving-kindness!</P>
