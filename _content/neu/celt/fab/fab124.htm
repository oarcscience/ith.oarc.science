<P>I. THE Calends of winter, hard is the grain;<BR>
The leaves are on the move, the plash is full;<BR>
In the morning before he sets off,<BR>
Woe to him that trusts to a stranger.</P>
<P>II. The Calends of winter, the time of pleasant gossiping,<BR>
The gale and the storm keep equal pace;<BR>
It is the work of the wise to keep a secret.</P>
<P>III. The Calends of winter, the stags are lean,<BR>
Yellow, the tops of birch, deserted the summer dwelling;<BR>
Woo to him who for a trifle deserves disgrace.</P>
<P>IV. The Calends of winter, the tops of the branches are bent;<BR>
Uproar from the mouth of the vicious is common;<BR>
Where there is no natural gift there will be no learning.</P>
<P>V. The Calends of winter, blustering is the weather,<BR>
Unlike the beginning of summer;<BR>
Except God, there is none that divines.</P>

<P>VI. The Calends of Winter, gay the plumage of birds;<BR>
Short the day; loud the cuckoos;<BR>
Mercifully has the most beneficent God made them.</P>
<P>VII, The Calends of winter, it is hard and dry;<BR>
Very black is the raven, quick the arrow from the bow;<BR>
At the stumbling of the old, the smile of the youth is apt to break out.</P>
<P>VIII. The Calends of winter, lean is the stag:<BR>
Woe to the weak! if he chafes, it will be but for a short while;<BR>
Truly better is amiability than beauty.</P>
<P>IX. The Calends of winter, bare is where the heath is burnt,<BR>
The plough is in the furrow; the ox at work;<BR>
Amongst a hundred there is hardly a friend.</P>
