<P>Soon it will happen that kindred by nature will be in the shout of war,<BR>
Soon will happen many a cut from the tournament;<BR>
Soon will come between Saxons a recoil<BR>
From mutual wounding, irreverent burying and ministering;<BR>
Soon will the men of Manaw come to obtain praise,<BR>
And the North they will certainly make without peace.<BR>
Soon will be in Prydein anxiety and want,<BR>
And around Lloegyr they will loudly complain;<BR>
For the falling of the son of Henri they will be amazed;<BR>
10 So great in the dispersion will be the trepidation!<BR>
Scattered over seas, a number of legions they will chase away.<BR>
Tumult will be on the borders, arrogance they will not respect.<BR>
And I will predict that they will energetically shout;<BR>
The innocent like the guilty, they will hew down.<BR>
With great ambition the navy of Lloegyr they will attack;<BR>
Barbarous hosts, plunder they will seek;<BR>
With open violence they will reduce towers,<BR>
And strongholds they will make weak.<BR>
In front of the host of the tournament,<BR>
20 For the contention of one day a myriad will fall;<BR>
On the seas they will openly cause destruction.<BR>
As for me, I will predict that children will not multiply, <A NAME="page_493"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 493</FONT></A><BR>
And it is not I that conceal that they will not be dispersed.<BR>
An age of repose the Creator will cause to be, and their extinction;<BR>
The Brythyon will scatter them, chief they will be.<BR>
Tribulation will ensue from the anger of relatives,<BR>
And the Saxons will be joyful when they see it.<BR>
The omen promises to shorten it while they will be.</P>
