<P>MESSENGERS to me are come, so numerously are they sent,<BR>
We shall bring a mutual conflict, so great is my bosom.<BR>
Like the effect of the oar in the brine is the liquor of Beli, <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A><BR>
Like a light shield on the back of a shadow.<BR>
Like wrath and indignation from the protection<BR>
Of a Caer, and nine hundred governors became dead.<BR>
There will be a battle on Menei, a vehement retribution.<BR>
There will be more on Conwy, the scar of angry strife shall cause it<BR>
Cold death the destiny of the ready muse,<BR>
10 From the vehement blade by the stroke of Edyrn.<BR>
Three elegant unrestrainable, fell, heavily laden with forces,<BR>
There fleets in the stream, an omen of the day of gloom.<BR>
Three evenings of battle for three proper<BR>
Countries: a boat was made a burying place.<BR>
Three of every three: three sins<BR>
And Eryri a hill of judgment.<BR>
A host of Saxons: the second they were, a third affliction.<BR>
In Cymry widowhood awaits women.<BR>
Before the presence of Cynan fire broke out.<BR>
20 Cadwaladyr will bewail him.<BR>
He injured the country with pain,<BR>
Straw; and roof of houses; the house he burnt.<BR>
There will be a wonder.<BR>
A man with the daughter of his brother.<BR>
They will cite what is steel<BR>
Of the lineage of Anarawd.<BR>
From him proceeded<BR>
Coch, wise his prudence.<BR>
He will not spare nor defend<BR>
30 Either cousin or brother.<BR>
At the voice of the warrior's horn,<BR>
Nine hundred (were) anxious,<BR>
Of universal affliction.<BR>
Thou wilt be calling forth verdancy from affected praise,<BR>
It will run to such as is oppressed in bosom.</P>
