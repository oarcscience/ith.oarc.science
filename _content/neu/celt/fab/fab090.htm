<P>I. NOT to call upon God, whose favour defends<BR>
Both the innocent and the angels,<BR>
Is too much of false pride;<BR>
Woe to him that does it openly in the world.</P>
<P>II. I love not treasure with traces of dwellings no longer existing;<BR>
Everything in the present state is like a summer habitation.<BR>
I am a man to Him whose praise is above all things,<BR>
To the most high God who made me.</P>

<P>III. I love to praise Peter, who can bestow true peace,<BR>
And with him his far-extending virtues;<BR>
In every language he is, with hope, acknowledged<BR>
As the gentle, high-famed, generous porter of heaven.</P>
<P>IV. God I will implore to grant a request,<BR>
Lord, be Eloi my Protector!<BR>
That to my soul, for fear of torments,<BR>
Be the whole protection of all the martyrs.</P>
<P>V. Of God I will ask another request,<BR>
That my soul, to be safe from the torments of enemies,<BR>
And held in remembrance, may have<BR>
The protection of the Virgin Mary and the holy maidens.</P>
<P>VI. Of God I will ask a request also,<BR>
Just is be, and able to defend me,<BR>
That to my soul, for fear of terrible torments,<BR>
Be the protection of the Christians of the world.</P>
<P>VII. Of God I will ask a considerate request,<BR>
That, being ready and diligent at all matins,<BR>
To my soul, for fear of punishment,<BR>
May be the protection of God and all the saints.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to call upon God--</P>
