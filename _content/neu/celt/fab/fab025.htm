<P>I. BEFORE Geraint, the enemy of oppression,<BR>
I saw white horses jaded and gory,<BR>
And after the shout, a terrible resistance.</P>

<P>II. Before Geraint, the unflinching foe,<BR>
I saw horses jaded and gory from the battle,<BR>
And after the shout, a terrible impulsion.</P>
<P>III. Before Geraint, the enemy of tyranny,<BR>
I saw horses white with foam,<BR>
And after the shout, a terrible torrent.</P>
<P>IV. In Llongborth I saw the rage of slaughter,<BR>
And biers beyond all number,<BR>
And red-stained men from the assault of Geraint.</P>
<P>V. In Llongborth I saw the edges of blades in contact,<BR>
Men in terror, and blood on the pate,<BR>
Before Geraint, the great son of his father.</P>
<P>VI. In Llongborth I saw the spurs<BR>
Of men who would not flinch from the dread of the spears,<BR>
And the drinking of wine out of the bright glass.</P>
<P>VII. In Llongborth I saw the weapons<BR>
Of men, and blood fast dropping,<BR>
And after the shout, a fearful return.</P>
<P>VIII. In Llongborth I saw Arthur,<BR>
And brave men who hewed down with steel,<BR>
Emperor, and conductor of the toll.</P>
<P>IX. In Llongborth Geraint was slain,<BR>
A brave man from the region of Dyvnaint,<BR>
And before they were overpowered, they committed slaughter.</P>

<P>X. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long-legged, with wheat for their corn,<BR>
Ruddy ones, with. the assault of spotted eagles.</P>
<P>XI. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long their legs, grain was given them,<BR>
Ruddy ones, with the assault of black eagles.</P>
<P>XII. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long-legged, restless over their grain,<BR>
Ruddy ones, with the assault of red eagles.</P>
<P>XIII. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long-legged, grain-scattering,<BR>
Ruddy ones, with the assault of white eagles.</P>
<P>XIV. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long-legged, with the pace of the stag,<BR>
With a nose like that of the consuming fire on a wild mountain.</P>
<P>XV. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long-legged, satiated with grain,<BR>
Grey ones, with their manes tipped with silver.</P>
<P>XVI. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long-legged, well deserving of grain,<BR>
Ruddy ones, with the assault of grey eagles.</P>
<P>XVII. Under the thigh of Geraint were swift racers,<BR>
Long-legged, having corn for food,<BR>
Ruddy ones, with the assault of brown eagles.</P>
<P>XVII. When Geraint was born, open were the gates of heaven,<BR>
Christ granted what was asked,<BR>
Beautiful the appearance of glorious Prydain.</P>
