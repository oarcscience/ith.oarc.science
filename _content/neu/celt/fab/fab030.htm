<P>PRIMITIVE and ingenious address, when thoroughly elucidated.<BR>
Which was first, is it darkness, is it light?<BR>
Or Adam, when he existed, on what day was he created?<BR>
Or under the earth's surface, what the foundation?<BR>
He who is a legionary will receive no instruction.<BR>
Est qui peccator in many things,<BR>
Will lose the heavenly country, the community of priests.<BR>
In the morning no one comes<BR>
If they sing of three spheres.<BR>
10 Angles and Gallwydel,<BR>
Let them make their way.<BR>
Whence come night and day?<BR>
Whence will the eagle become gray?<BR>
Whence is it that night is dark?<BR>
Whence is it that the linnet is green?<BR>
The ebullition of the sea, <A NAME="page_285"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 285</FONT></A><BR>
How is it not seen?<BR>
There are three fountains<BR>
In the mountain of roses,<BR>
20 There is a Caer of defence<BR>
Under the ocean's wave.<BR>
Illusive greeter,<BR>
What is the porter's name?<BR>
Who was confessor<BR>
To the gracious Son of Mary?<BR>
What was the most beneficial measure<BR>
Which Adam accomplished?<BR>
Who will measure Uffern?<BR>
How thick its veil?<BR>
30 How wide its mouth?<BR>
What the size of its stones?<BR>
Or the tops of its whirling trees?<BR>
Who bends them so crooked?<BR>
Or what fumes may be<BR>
About their stems?<BR>
Is it Lleu and Gwydyon<BR>
That perform their arts?<BR>
Or do they know books<BR>
When they do?<BR>
40 Whence come night and flood?<BR>
How they disappear?<BR>
Whither flies night from day;<BR>
And how is it not seen?<BR>
Pater noster ambulo<BR>
Gentis tonans in adjuvando<BR>
Sibilem signum<BR>
Rogantes fortium.<BR>
Excellent in every way around the glens<BR>
The two skilful ones make inquiries<BR>
50 About Caer Cerindan Cerindydd <A NAME="page_286"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 286</FONT></A><BR>
For the draught-horses of pector David.<BR>
They have enjoyment--they move about--<BR>
May they find me greatly expanding.<BR>
The Cymry will be lamenting<BR>
While their souls will be tried<BR>
Before a horde of ravagers.<BR>
The Cymry, chief wicked ones,<BR>
On account of the loss of holy wafers.<BR>
There will long be crying and wailing,<BR>
60 And gore will be conspicuous.<BR>
There came by sea<BR>
The wood-steeds of the strand.<BR>
The Angles in council<BR>
Shall see signs of<BR>
Exultation over Saxons.<BR>
The praises of the rulers<BR>
Will be celebrated in Sion.<BR>
Let the chief builders be<BR>
Against the fierce Ffichti,<BR>
70 The Morini Brython.<BR>
Their fate has been predicted;<BR>
And the reaping of heroes<BR>
About the river Severn.<BR>
The stealing is disguised of Ken and Masswy<BR>
Ffis amala, ffur, ffir, sel,<BR>
Thou wilt discern the Trinity beyond my age<BR>
I implore the Creator, hai<BR>
Huai, that the Gentile may vanish<BR>
From the Gospel. Equally worthy<BR>
80 With the retinue of the wall<BR>
Cornu ameni dur.<BR>
I have been with skilful men,<BR>
With Matheu and Govannon,<BR>
With Eunydd and Elestron, <A NAME="page_287"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 287</FONT></A><BR>
In company with Achwyson,<BR>
For a year in Caer Gofannon.<BR>
I am old. I am young. I am Gwion,<BR>
I am universal, I am possessed of penetrating wit.<BR>
Thou wilt remember thy old Brython<BR>
90 (And) the Gwyddyl, kiln distillers,<BR>
Intoxicating the drunkards.<BR>
I am a bard; I will not disclose secrets to slaves;<BR>
I am a guide: I am expert in contests.<BR>
If he would sow, he would plough; he would plough, he would not reap.<BR>
If a brother among brothers,<BR>
Didactic Bards with swelling breasts will arise<BR>
Who will meet around mead-vessels,<BR>
And sing wrong poetry<BR>
And seek rewards that will not be,<BR>
100 Without law, without regulation, without gifts.<BR>
And afterwards will become angry.<BR>
There will be commotions and turbulent times,<BR>
Seek no peace--it will not accrue to thee.<BR>
The Ruler of Heaven knows thy prayer.<BR>
From his ardent wrath thy praise has propitiated hint<BR>
The Sovereign King of Glory addresses me with wisdom:--<BR>
Hast thou seen the dominus fortis?<BR>
Knowest thou the profound prediction domini?<BR>
To the advantage of Uffern<BR>
110 Hic nemo in por progenie<BR>
He has liberated its tumultuous multitude.<BR>
Dominus virtutum<BR>
Has gathered together those that were in slavery,<BR>
And before I existed He had perceived me.<BR>
May I be ardently devoted to God!<BR>
And before I desire the end of existence, <A NAME="page_288"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 288</FONT></A><BR>
And before the broken foam shall come upon my lips,<BR>
And before I become connected with wooden boards,<BR>
May there be festivals to my soul!<BR>
120 Book-learning scarcely tells me<BR>
Of severe afflictions after death-bed<BR>
And such as have heard my bardic books<BR>
They shall obtain the region of heaven, the best of all abodes.</P>
