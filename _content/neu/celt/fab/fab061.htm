<P>A rumour has come to met from Calchvynyd,<BR>
A disgrace in the south country, a praiseworthy pillage.<BR>
And he will give to a lion the fierceness of his baptism.<BR>
Full is his strath of joyful produce.<BR>
The people are satiated with warfare, the strangers are satiated,<BR>
A battle of encroachment, during the excessive heat of the country,<BR>
A wonder of Cymry that relate it.<BR>
Let the cattle of the son of Idno come to Dyved.<BR>
And let no one dare not to come.<BR>
10 To pay a hundred cows I will give one calf.<BR>
The slaughter of thy foes about thy country,<BR>
Like fire it heats a vapour where it happens to be.<BR>
When we made an expedition to the land of Gwydno,<BR>
There was a corpse delicately fair between the gravel and the pebbles on the bank.<BR>
When he returned in the autumn from the country of Clydesmen,<BR>
The cow did not low to her calf.<BR>
Will greet Mabon from another country,<BR>
A battle, when Owain defends the cattle of his country.<BR>
A battle in the ford of Alclud, a battle in the Gwen, <A NAME="page_364"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 364</FONT></A><BR>
20 A battle, in conjunction of tumult to them.<BR>
A battle against Rodawys of snowy-white aspect,<BR>
Brandishing of spears and black, and bright sheets,<BR>
A battle on this side of the gleaming guiding heart of oak.<BR>
A shield in hand, the camp trembling,<BR>
Saw Mabon on the fair portion of Reidol.<BR>
Against the kine of Reged they engaged,<BR>
If they had wings they would have flown.<BR>
Against Mabon without corpses they would not go.<BR>
Meeting, they descend and commence the battle.<BR>
30 The country of Mabon is pierced with destructive slaughter.<BR>
When Owain descends for the kine of his father,<BR>
There broke out lime, and wax, and hawthorn.<BR>
Is it not fair prey for any one to take a bald cow?<BR>
Support each other against men with ruddy spears.<BR>
Against the four-way-spreading conflagration,<BR>
Against the mighty rising.<BR>
Against gore on flesh,<BR>
Against a dismal straining.<BR>
A rumour came to me,<BR>
40 From the bright lands of the South.<BR>
Splendid and liberal chiefs declare<BR>
That thou shalt not be addressed by vulgar ones.<BR>
About the ford of the boundary, about the alders his battle-places.<BR>
When was caused the battle of the king, sovereign, prince,<BR>
Very wild will the kine be before Mabon.<BR>
From the meeting of Gwrgun.<BR>
The resting-place of the corpses of some was in Run.<BR>
There was joy, there will be for ravens.<BR>
Loud the talk of men after<BR>
50 Battle. Escaped not the shield of Owain.<BR>
With notched shield an opposing in battle tumult, <A NAME="page_365"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 365</FONT></A><BR>
Cattle would not run about without crimson faces.<BR>
Crimson were the kine of Bender, and great his grace,<BR>
Gore surrounding the top of his head.<BR>
And a white face conspicuous the gasping.<BR>
The golden saddle (was) drenched in gore, as to its appearance.<BR>
The Gwentians praise the booty, the booty was extended,<BR>
The booty in front of the eager battle of the eager strangers.<BR>
A booty of heads with forked branches. On the shields<BR>
60 Awfully the blades are falling about the head.<BR>
A battle in front of Owain, great, great his rage.<BR>
A fine day, they fell, men, defending (their) country.<BR>
There rested the extreme-impelling advantage of their father.</P>
