<P>I. I WILL pray God to deliver the people of the fair (town),<BR>
The owner of heaven and earth, ill-wise pervader. <A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A><BR>
A pleasant Caer there is on the surface of the ocean.<BR>
May be joyful in the splendid festival its king.<BR>
And the time when the sea makes great audacity.<BR>
The crowns of bards are usual over mead-vessels.<BR>
A wave will come, in haste, speed unto it,<BR>
That will bring them to the green sward from the region of the Ffichti.<BR>
And may I obtain, O God, for my prayer,<BR>
When I keep the covenant of conciliation with thee.</P>
<P>II. A pleasant Caer there is on a broad lake,<BR>
A fortress impregnable, the sea surrounds it.<BR>
Prydain greets thee: how will these agree?<BR>
The point of the lake of the son of Erbin; be thine the oxen.<BR>
There has been a retinue, and there has been song, in the second place,<BR>
And an eagle, high in the sky, and the path of Granwyn,<BR>
Before the governing sovereign, that refuses not to start,<BR>
The dispersed of renown, and a leader, they form themselves.</P>
<P>III. A pleasant Caer there is on the ninth wave,<BR>
Pleasant its denizens in guarding each other.<BR>
They will not take them if it be through disgrace.<BR>
It is not their custom to be hard.<BR>
I will not speak falsely, upon my privilege,<BR>
Than the tenants of the two strands better the serfs of Dyved,<BR>
An associate, if he gives a banquet of deliverers,<BR>
Will contain between every two the best multitude.</P>
<P>IV. A pleasant Caer there is, it will be made complete<BR>
By meads, and praise, and mountain-birds. <A NAME="page_305"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 305</FONT></A><BR>
Smooth its songs, on its festival,<BR>
And my intelligent Lord, a splendid distributor,<BR>
Before he went into his grave, in the boundary of the Llan,<BR>
He gave me mead and wine from a crystal cup.</P>
<P>V. A pleasant Caer there is on the shore of the gulf,<BR>
Pleasantly is given to every one his share.<BR>
I know in Dinbych, white with sea-mews,<BR>
A mild associate, the lord of Erlysan.<BR>
He was my law, on New Year's eve,<BR>
His song (was) solace, the king of splendid war.<BR>
And a veil of green colour, and possessing a feast.<BR>
This may I be, a tongue over the bards of Prydain.</P>
<P>VI. A pleasant Caer there is, that is supported with gifts,<BR>
Mine were its fords, should I have chosen.<BR>
I will not speak of the progress of the law that I had kept,<BR>
He deserves not a New Year's gift that knows not this.<BR>
The writing of Prydain, anxious care,<BR>
While the waves continue to be agitated about it,<BR>
If necessary, far into a cell I would penetrate.</P>
<P>VII. A pleasant Caer there is, rising up,<BR>
May we have shares in its meads and praises.<BR>
Pleasant on its boundary the sending forth of its chieftains.<BR>
A cormorant approaches me, long its wings,<BR>
There comes to the top of the scream of the sea-birds.<BR>
Wrath within fate, let it penetrate the sands and stones,<BR>
And the gray wolf the best of conflicts.<BR>
May there be derived from above the banquet accordant reasonings. <A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A><BR>
The blessing of the beneficent Ruler of Heaven's harmonious heights (be)<BR>
Upon them; may He make denizens (there) the worthies of Owain.</P>
<P>VIII. A pleasant Caer there is on the margin of the flood.<BR>
Pleasantly is given to every (one) his desire.<BR>
Address thou Gwyned, be thine the increase.<BR>
The dartings of the terrible spears were poured forth.<BR>
Wednesday, I saw men in distress,<BR>
Thursday, to their disgrace they returned.<BR>
And there were crimsoned hair, and clamorous woe.<BR>
Exhausted were the men of Gwyned the day that they came.<BR>
And on Cevn Llech Vaelwy shields they will break.<BR>
They fell at the Cevn, a host of kinsmen.</P>
