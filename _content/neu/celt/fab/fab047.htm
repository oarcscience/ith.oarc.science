<P>THOUGH I love the strand, I hate the sea.<BR>
How the wave covered the stone of Camwr! <A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A><BR>
The brave, the magnanimous, the amiable, the generous, and the energetic,<BR>
Are as stepping-stones to the bards of the world, and an advantageous shelter.<BR>
The fame of Heilyn proved a benefit to the solicitous.<BR>
To the day of judgment may his celebrity remain!<BR>
Though I love the strand, I hate the wave.<BR>
The wave has done violence, dismal the blow to the breast.<BR>
He will complain as long as he believes on its account.<BR>
10 It is a cheerful work to bathe on my bosom,<BR>
Though it (the water) fills the cavity, it does not disturb the heart.<BR>
And in the direction of Cyhaig did the wave arise.<BR>
Sorry we are for his concerns,<BR>
When Pebrwr from afar hastened to his death.<BR>
The brave and courageous multitude will affect us both;<BR>
As the water bearing the leaves shows it thee.<BR>
Mechydd is sad on account of thy coming.<BR>
I will not receive thee to my receptacle.<BR>
From my part I sold a horse for thee.<BR>
20 Cyhaig will revenge for the delay of his enjoyment,<BR>
And for the sweet strains.<BR>
O dwarf! for thy anger to me there have been enemies.</P>
