<P>SOVEREIGN of the power of the air, thou also<BR>
The satisfaction of my transgressions.<BR>
At midnight and at matins<BR>
There shone my lights.<BR>
Courteous the life of Minawg ap Llen,<BR>
Whom I saw here a short while ago.<BR>
The end, in the slope of Lleu.<BR>
Ardent was his push in combats;<BR>
Avagddu my son also.<BR>
10 Happy the Lord made him,<BR>
In the competition of songs,<BR>
His wisdom was better than mine,<BR>
The most skilful man ever heard of.<BR>
Gwydyon ap Don, of toiling spirits,<BR>
Enchanted a woman from blossoms,<BR>
And brought pigs from the south.<BR>
Since he had no sheltering cots,<BR>
Rapid curves, and plaited chains.<BR>
He made the forms of horses<BR>
20 From the springing<BR>
Plants, and illustrious saddles.<BR>
When are judged the chairs, <A NAME="page_297"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 297</FONT></A><BR>
Excelling them (will be) mine,<BR>
My chair, my cauldron, and my laws,<BR>
And my pervading eloquence, meet for the chair.<BR>
I am called skilful in the court of Don.<BR>
I, and Euronwy, and Euron.<BR>
I saw a fierce conflict in Nant Frangeon<BR>
On a Sunday, at the time of dawn,<BR>
30 Between the bird of wrath and Gwydyon.<BR>
Thursday, certainly, they went to Mona<BR>
To obtain whirlings and sorcerers.<BR>
Arianrod, of laudable aspect, dawn of serenity,<BR>
The greatest disgrace evidently on the side of the Brython,<BR>
Hastily sends about his court the stream of a rainbow,<BR>
A stream that scares away violence from the earth.<BR>
The poison of its former state, about the world, it will leave.<BR>
They speak not falsely, the books of Beda.<BR>
The chair of the Preserver is here.<BR>
40 And till doom, shall continue in Europa.<BR>
May the Trinity grant us<BR>
Mercy in the day of judgment.<BR>
A fair alms from good men.</P>
