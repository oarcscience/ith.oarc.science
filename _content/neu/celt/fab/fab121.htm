<P>I WONDER that there is not proclaimed<BR>
An acknowledgment of heaven to the earth.<BR>
Of the coming of a giant Ruler,<BR>
Alexander the Great.<BR>
Alexander, possessor of multitudes.<BR>
Passionate, iron-gifted, <A NAME="page_568 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 568 </FONT></A><BR>
Eminent for sword-strokes.<BR>
He went under the sea,<BR>
Under the sea he went,<BR>
10 To seek for science.<BR>
Whoever seeks science,<BR>
Let him be clamorous in mind.<BR>
He went above the wind,<BR>
Between two griffins on a journey,<BR>
To see a sight.<BR>
A sight he saw,<BR>
The present was not sufficient.<BR>
He saw a wonder.<BR>
A superiority of lineage with fishes.<BR>
20 What he desired in his mind,<BR>
He had from the world.<BR>
And also at his end<BR>
With God, mercy.</P>
