<P>HOW miserable it is to see<BR>
Tumult, commotion,<BR>
Wounds and confusion,<BR>
The Brithwyr in motion,<BR>
And a cruel fate.<BR>
With the impulse of destiny,<BR>
And for heaven's sake<BR>
Declare the discontinuance of the disaster!<BR>
It is not well that a son should be born:<BR>
10 His youthful destiny<BR>
Will necessarily be unbelief<BR>
And general privation:--<BR>
The Lloegrians declare it.<BR>
Alas! for the utter confusion<BR>
Until the end of the seventh<BR>
From the hard Calends.<BR>
True it is, deliverance will come<BR>
By means of the wished-for man.<BR>
May he throw open the White Mount,<BR>
20 And into Gwynedd make his entry!<BR>
The forces of the Cymry <A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A><BR>
Will be of one course with the lightning:<BR>
The signal of their deliverance<BR>
Will be a true relief, to the bosom:<BR>
The guarantee being Reged,<BR>
Whose share will be glorious.<BR>
Glorious will be our portion.<BR>
To me has been given sway,<BR>
I have become a predicting bard:<BR>
30 Camlan will be heard again<BR>
Scenes of groaning will again be seen,<BR>
And dismal lamentations,<BR>
And mischievous contention,<BR>
And the child will grow<BR>
Strong in battle, even when small.<BR>
People will see battles,<BR>
And the increase of fortresses;<BR>
Many a banner will be shattered:<BR>
A red banner I know there is,<BR>
40 It will be death to vanquish it<BR>
A signal of their coming,--<BR>
The heroic warriors,<BR>
Who will defend their fame.<BR>
Active their swords before thee,<BR>
Before me their virtues.<BR>
They shall receive their portion before death.<BR>
The day of causing blood-streams,<BR>
The day of assailing walls,<BR>
Will come for certain,<BR>
50 And fleets on the water,<BR>
Neither tax nor tribute<BR>
Nor service will succeed,<BR>
Nor the entreaties of the weak will avail,<BR>
Under the sway of the rulers.<BR>
May hens be relics <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A><BR>
From Mona to Mynneu!<BR>
Believe in the living God for benefits,<BR>
Who will dispense us free blessings.<BR>
By imploring saints,<BR>
60 And the thorough comprehension of books,<BR>
May we obtain, an Thursday, a, portion<BR>
In the blissful region, the splendid place of rest!</P>
