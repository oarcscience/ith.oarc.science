<P>A SKILFUL composition, the pattern being from God,<BR>
A composition, the language, beautiful and pleasant, from Christ.<BR>
And should there be a language all complete around the sun,<BR>
On as many pivots as there are under the sea,<BR>
On as many winged ones as the Almighty made,<BR>
And should every one have thrice three hundred tongues,<BR>
They could not relate the power of the Trinity.<BR>
A diligent man in prosperity will receive no punishment.<BR>
Let communion be ready against the Trinity.<BR>
10 Let him be ill and ailing when his flesh becomes weak,<BR>
That he may puff his disguise.<BR>
Woe to thee, man of passion; if the world were given me,<BR>
Unless thou wert to deliver thyself, thou wouldst be satiated of the evil.<BR>
Art thou not at liberty as regards what thy mind loves?<BR>
Furious thy violent death, thy being borne on the wattled frame;<BR>
More wretched thy end, thy interment in the grave,<BR>
And being trodden by feet in the midst of soil and sod.<BR>
Unequalled thy journey, thy separation from thy companions.<BR>
Faithless and useless body, think of thy soul!<BR>
20 Body, thou wouldst not hear when others spoke. <A NAME="page_505"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 505</FONT></A><BR>
What gavest thou of thy wealth before private confession?<BR>
What gavest thou of thy riches before the close and silent pit?<BR>
And what thou hadst intended, thou hast left undone<BR>
And thou sawest not how many thou shouldst have loved.<BR>
And a benefit it would have been as regards the passions of the people.<BR>
And the good would have come to so much prosperity.<BR>
When thou of thy freedom purchasest a hundred things, they are uncertain,<BR>
And vanish as suddenly as the motion of eyelid.<BR>
Hast thou noticed that they love sinisterly while seeking violence?<BR>
30 Thou respectedst not Friday, of thy great humility<BR>
Thou chantedst not a paternoster at matins or vespers,<BR>
A paternoster, the chief thing to be repeated: meditate on nothing<BR>
Except the Trinity.<BR>
Thou shouldst pay what is equal to three seven paternosters daily.<BR>
What has been and is not, and their life has not passed away.<BR>
Thou art more accustomed to the roaring of the sea than to the preaching of the evangel.<BR>
Must thou not go to the pile, because thou hast not been humble?<BR>
Thou respectedst neither relies, nor altars, nor churches.<BR>
Thou didst not attend to the strains of bards of harmonious utterance.<BR>
40 Thou didst not respect the law of the Creator of heaven before death.<BR>
A strange mixture didst thou employ in thy speech.<BR>
Woe is me that I went with thee to our joint work!<BR>
Woe is me when I am about to praise thee! <A NAME="page_506"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 506</FONT></A><BR>
When I came to thee, small was my evil,<BR>
But it came to me from thy grovelling co-operation.<BR>
As for them, none will believe us respecting thy appearance of enjoyment.</P>
