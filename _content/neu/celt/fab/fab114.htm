<P>O GOD, the God of formation,<BR>
Ruler, strengthener of blood.<BR>
Christ Jesus, that guards,<BR>
Princes loud-proclaiming go their course.<BR>
For a decaying acquisition.<BR>
It will not make me without shares,<BR>
The praising thy mercy.<BR>
There hath not been here;<BR>
O supreme Ruler;<BR>
10 There hath not been; there will not be,<BR>
One so good as the Lord.<BR>
There hath not been born in the day of the people<BR>
Any one equal to God.<BR>
And no one will acknowledge<BR>
Any one equal to him. <A NAME="page_553"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 553</FONT></A><BR>
Above heaven, below heaven,<BR>
There is no Ruler but he.<BR>
Above sea, below sea,<BR>
He created us.<BR>
20 When God comes<BR>
A great noise will pierce us,<BR>
The day of judgment terribly.<BR>
Messengers from the door,<BR>
Wind, and sea, and fire.<BR>
Lightning and thunder.<BR>
A number without flattery.<BR>
The people of the world groaning<BR>
Will be concealed. A reaching arm will be brought.<BR>
Will be concealed the sea and stars,<BR>
30 When the Father descends,<BR>
To take vengeance with his hosts<BR>
With trumpets penetrating into the four regions.<BR>
And to set the sea on fire.<BR>
The nations of the world will be burnt,<BR>
Until they are reduced to ashes.<BR>
Was burnt the desert portion<BR>
Before his great presence.<BR>
He will draw a stream<BR>
Before his front rank.<BR>
O Kings will shudder (that) day,<BR>
Woe awaits them!<BR>
When the recompenser shall appear,<BR>
Let the heaven appear below.<BR>
A ruddy wind will be brought<BR>
Out to the cinder,<BR>
Until the world is as desolate<BR>
As when created.<BR>
Saint Peter says it,<BR>
The day of the earth; <A NAME="page_554"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 554</FONT></A><BR>
50 There will come a Saturday,<BR>
The earth in one furnace.<BR>
Saturday, a clear morning<BR>
The love-diffusing (Lord) will separate us.<BR>
The land of worldly weather,<BR>
A wind will melt the trees:<BR>
There will pass away every tranquillity<BR>
When the mountains are burnt.<BR>
There will be again inhabitants<BR>
With horns before kings;<BR>
60 The mighty One will send them,<BR>
Sea, and land, and lake.<BR>
There will be again a trembling terror,<BR>
And a moving of the earth,<BR>
And above every field,<BR>
And ashes the rocks will be;<BR>
With violent exertion, concealment,<BR>
And burning of lake.<BR>
A wave do ye displace,<BR>
A shield do ye extend<BR>
70 To the travelling woe,<BR>
And violent exertion through grief.<BR>
And inflaming through fury<BR>
Between heaven and earth.<BR>
When the Trinity shall come<BR>
To the field of its majesty,<BR>
The host of heaven about it,<BR>
An extensive tribe near it,<BR>
Songs and minstrels.<BR>
And the hymns of angels,<BR>
80 Will raise from the graves,<BR>
They will entreat from the beginning<BR>
They will entreat together publicly,<BR>
On so great a destiny. <A NAME="page_555"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 555</FONT></A><BR>
Those whom the sea has destroyed<BR>
Will make a great shout,<BR>
At the time when cometh<BR>
He, that will separate them.<BR>
As many as are mine,<BR>
Let them go to the right.<BR>
90 Those that have done evil,<BR>
Lot them go to the left side.<BR>
Do not thy passions counteract<BR>
What thy lips utter?<BR>
Thy going in thy course into valleys,<BR>
Dark. without lights.<BR>
And mine were his words.<BR>
And mine were his languages.<BR>
And mine was his bright country,<BR>
And their hundred fulnesses.<BR>
100 The hundredth country present.<BR>
I have not been without battle.<BR>
Bitter affliction was frequent<BR>
Between me and my cousins.<BR>
Frequent trials fell<BR>
between me and my fellow-countrymen.<BR>
There was frequent contention<BR>
Between me and the wretched.<BR>
This ever overcame me,<BR>
Man would never do it.<BR>
110 (Those) that placed me on the cross<BR>
I knew when young.<BR>
That drove me on the tree,<BR>
My head hung down.<BR>
Stretched were my two feet,<BR>
So sad their destiny.<BR>
Stretched with extreme pain<BR>
The bones of my feet. <A NAME="page_556"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 556</FONT></A><BR>
Stretched were my two arms,<BR>
Their burden will not be.<BR>
120 Stretched were my two shoulders,<BR>
So diligently it was done.<BR>
Stretched were the nails,<BR>
Within my heart.<BR>
Stretched was the spiking,<BR>
Between my two eyes.<BR>
Thick are the holes<BR>
Of the crown of thorns in my head.<BR>
The lance was struck<BR>
And my side was pierced.<BR>
130 It will be struck to you also,<BR>
As your right hand (struck me).<BR>
To you there will be no forgiveness,<BR>
For piercing me with spears.<BR>
And the Ruler we knew not<BR>
When thou wert hung.<BR>
Ruler of heaven, Ruler of every people!<BR>
We knew not, O Christ! that it was thou.<BR>
If we had known thee,<BR>
Christ, we should have refrained from thee.<BR>
140 A denial will not be received<BR>
From the race of the lower country.<BR>
Ye have committed wickedness<BR>
Against the Creator.<BR>
A hundred thousand angels<BR>
Are to me witnesses,<BR>
Who came to conduct me<BR>
After my hanging,<BR>
When hanging cruelly,<BR>
Myself to deliver me<BR>
150 In heaven there was trembling<BR>
When I had been hung. <A NAME="page_557"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 557</FONT></A><BR>
When I cried out Eli!<BR>
God love-prospering above heaven.<BR>
And sing ye, the two Johns,<BR>
Before me the two primary parts.<BR>
With two books in your hands,<BR>
Reading them.<BR>
There would not come a great difficulty<BR>
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
160 And yours will be flattery,<BR>
The value of your foolish speech.<BR>
Dissolution will close.<BR>
Upon you to moist Uffern.<BR>
Christ Jesus high hath founded three hundred thousand years,<BR>
Since he is in life,<BR>
And a second thousand before the cross<BR>
Shone Enoch.<BR>
Do not the brave know<BR>
The greatness of their progeny?<BR>
170 A country present will meet thee,<BR>
And while it may possibly be yours,<BR>
Three hundred thousand years save one,<BR>
A short hour of the day of everlasting life.</P>
