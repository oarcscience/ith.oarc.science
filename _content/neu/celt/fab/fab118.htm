<P>AND God the possessor, God the regulator, merciful diviner,<BR>
Great., wonderful, when thou protectedst me through the wave.<BR>
The hosts of Moses, sovereign Lord, woe their dispersion!<BR>
Pharaoh and his host perceived them, cursing the cause,<BR>
And to sea thou madest new the cause.<BR>
Did he not allure them through an inundation that drowns birds?<BR>
From where the sun rises to the west there was land.<BR>
Thou wouldst protect those that thou lovest from every prison<BR>
Except hosts, vehement their shout, heavy their din.<BR>
10 And protect us also from the miseries of Uffern fierce.<BR>
And God the possessor, God the regulator, merciful diviner,<BR>
Thine is the country of heaven, it is in peace that thou lovest.<BR>
There is not weariness, nor want in thy country, Lord.<BR>
No one will be ordered; no one will be an enemy to another.<BR>
I would have known, if I had understood, for shame,<BR>
That thou lovest, the Holy Trinity, any one that is skilful.<BR>
Bards disparage you; they love much for ever.<BR>
That was not vile, the Israel which thou placedst in the hand of David.<BR>
Alexander had a large number of men.<BR>
20 He would not have been strong, had he not thy friendship,<BR>
With his armies and great battles and his tortuous hosts.<BR>
When they came to the land they were sad in their death. <A NAME="page_564"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 564</FONT></A><BR>
Solomon the judge contained the land, he was better than they.<BR>
Son of kings. He was accustomed to riches for his auxiliary.<BR>
The sons of Jacob were rich on their land;<BR>
What they liked, they shared according to the word of the Lord.<BR>
Abel, innocent, was prosperous, and took the faith,<BR>
His brother Cain was headstrong, evil his counsel.<BR>
Aser and Soyw in the clear air, their co-operators.<BR>
30 A star-angel conducteth a number before their warriors,<BR>
With the wand of Moses, him and his hosts on their land.<BR>
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
The talkative and dumb and wise and bold were redressed,<BR>
Ruler protect, one protection to those that deserve death.<BR>
I also will praise the abode of hosts, the dwelling of blessedness,<BR>
I also will praise the best repository that overflows the world.<BR>
The chief kingdom that Jonah brought from the centre of junction,<BR>
The nation of Nineveh, he was a man that joyfully preached.<BR>
Queens over sea had the shadow of the Lord, that protected them,<BR>
40 And Maria Mary, daughter of Anna, great her penitence.<BR>
Through thy generosity and mercy, King of the world!<BR>
May there be to us, in the cities of heaven, admission to thee.</P>
