<P>GOD supreme, be mine the Awen! Amen; fiat!<BR>
A successful song of fruitful praise, relating to the bustling course of the host,<BR>
According to the sacred ode of Cyridwen, the goddess of various seeds,<BR>
The various seeds of poetic harmony, the exalted speech of the graduated minstrel,<BR>
Cuhelyn the bard of elegant Cymraec utterly rejects.<BR>
A poem for a favour, the gift of friendship, will not be maintained. .<BR>
But a composition of thorough praise is being brought to thee,<BR>
Splendid singer in a choir, and of a song equal in length and motion.<BR>
Appropriate and full were the tuneful horns, gloriously ascended the conflagration <A NAME="page_499"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 499</FONT></A><BR>
10 Of the nation of the border, whose troops were of the same pace and simultaneous movement.<BR>
Praise the here, whose gift is large, the benefit of humble suitors,<BR>
Light is the rebuke of the rallying-point of relatives, the winner of praise,<BR>
A skilful fastener, for a hundred calends, the accumulator of heat;<BR>
A fierce frowning wolf, whose inflexible disposition is law, accustomed to jurisdiction.<BR>
Eidoel was a man extremely brave, very choice and full of wisdom;<BR>
A leader as regards the Brython, full of knowledge and prudence, fiery in his wrath;<BR>
Accustomed to hatred, accustomed to harmony, and to the high seat in the banquet of mead;<BR>
Partaker of the intoxicating wine, a knight of the list, a place of limitation;<BR>
A lord who is the measurer of the wall, the delight of the four quarters, the great centre power;<BR>
20 A knight of stout conduct, a knight of virtuous conduct, with warriors full of rage;<BR>
A guardian celebrated in song, a fine panegyric, the blandishment of language.<BR>
Odious was his death by Nognaw. Am I not agitated? The active and eloquent one will I praise;<BR>
A contented ruler, a restless guardian, energetic and wise.<BR>
A company of active reapers, melodious poetry, and the assuaging of wrath<BR>
A talented hero, like a furious wave over the strand,<BR>
The marrow of fine songs, a contemplative mind, a sacred mystery;<BR>
A servitor with knowledge, the possession of mead, in agreeable eulogy; <A NAME="page_500"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 500</FONT></A><BR>
Music which has melody like that of a golden organ, a place of retirement;<BR>
The action of law against violence, the admirable vigour of the brave, the energy of the Supreme Being.<BR>
30 A blessing I will venture to ask, a blessing I will pray for, I will bind myself thereby;<BR>
The wonderful rush of the gale, the pervasion of fire, the war of youth;<BR>
One deserving of ruddy gold, one liberal of praise furrowed (with age), a free wing;<BR>
Ready affluence, a rill in a pleasant shelter, a reward for a panegyric.<BR>
The most deserving will yield, he will keep his refuge from the insult of the enemy:<BR>
He has completely kept the law, completely shown his disposition before the placid Ogyrven.<BR>
For a good turn from me, may the gift of Cuhelyn give satisfaction of mind.</P>
