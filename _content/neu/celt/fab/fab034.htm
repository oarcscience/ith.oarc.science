<P>I, BULL of conflict was he, active in dispersing an arrayed army,<BR>
The ruler of hosts, indisposed to anger,<BR>
Blameless and pure his conduct in protecting life.</P>
<P>II. Against a hero stout was his advance,<BR>
The ruler of hosts, disposer of wrath.<BR>
There will be protection for thee since thou askest it.</P>
<P>III. For thou hast given me protection<BR>
How warmly wert thou welcomed!<BR>
The hero of hosts, from what region thou comest?</P>
<P>IV. I come from battle and conflict<BR>
With a shield in my hand;<BR>
Broken is the helmet by the pushing of spears.<BR>
V. I will address thee, exalted man,<BR>
With his shield in distress;<BR>
Brave man, what is thy descent?</P>
<P>VI. Round-hoofed is my horse, the torment of battle,<BR>
"Whilst I am called Gwyn, the son of Nud,<BR>
The lover of Creurdilad, the daughter of Llud.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_294"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 294</FONT></A></P>
<P>VII. Since it is thou, Gwyn, an upright man,<BR>
From thee there is no concealing;<BR>
I also am Gwydneu Garanhir.</P>
<P>VIII. He will not leave me in a parley with thee,<BR>
By the bridle, as is becoming;<BR>
But will hasten away to his home on the Tawy.</P>
<P>IX. It is not the nearest Tawy I speak of to thee,<BR>
But the furthest Tawy;<BR>
Eagle! I will cause the furious sea to ebb.</P>
<P>X. Polished is my ring, golden my saddle and bright:<BR>
To my sadness<BR>
I saw a conflict before Caer Vandwy.</P>
<P>XI. Before Caer Vandwy a host I saw,<BR>
Shields were shattered and ribs broken<BR>
Renowned and splendid was he who made the assault.</P>
<P>XII. Gwyn ab Nud, the hope of armies,<BR>
Sooner would legions fall before the hoofs<BR>
of thy horses, than broken rushes to the ground.</P>
<P>XIII. Handsome my dog and round-bodied,<BR>
And truly the best of dogs;<BR>
Dormach was he, which belonged to Maelgwn.</P>
<P>XIV Dormach with the ruddy nose! what a gazer<BR>
Thou art upon me! because I notice<BR>
Thy wanderings on Gwibir Vynyd.</P>
<P>XV. I have been in the place where was killed Gwondoleu,<BR>
The son of Ceidaw, the pillar of songs,<BR>
When the ravens screamed over blood.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A></P>
<P>XVI. I have been in the place where Bran was killed,<BR>
The son of Gweryd, of far-extending fame,<BR>
When the ravens of the battle-field screamed.</P>
<P>XVII. I have been where Llachau was slain,<BR>
The son of Arthur, extolled in songs,<BR>
When the ravens screamed over blood.</P>
<P>XVIII. I have been where Meurig was killed,<BR>
The son of Carreian, of honourable fame,<BR>
When the ravens screamed over flesh.</P>
<P>XIX. I have not been where Gwallawg was killed,<BR>
The son of Goholeth, the accomplished,.<BR>
The resister of Lloegir, the son of Lleynawg.</P>
<P>XX. I have been where the soldiers of Prydain were slain,<BR>
From the East to the North;<BR>
I am alive, they in their graves!</P>
<P>XXI. I have been where the soldiers of Prydain were slain,<BR>
From the East to the South<BR>
I am alive, they in death!</P>
