<P>AM I not with hosts making a din?<BR>
I would not cease, between two hosts, without gore.<BR>
Am I not he that is called Gorlassar?<BR>
My belt was a rainbow to my foe.<BR>
Am I not a prince, in darkness, <A NAME="page_298"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 298</FONT></A><BR>
(To him) that takes my appearance with my two chief baskets?<BR>
Am I not, like Cawyl, ploughing?<BR>
I would not cease without gore between two hosts.<BR>
Is it not I that will defend my sanctuary?<BR>
10 In separating with the friends of wrath.<BR>
Have I not been accustomed to blood about the wrathful,<BR>
A sword-stroke daring against the sons of Cawrnur?<BR>
Have I not shared my cause.<BR>
A ninth portion in the prowess of Arthur?<BR>
Is it not I that have destroyed a hundred Caers?<BR>
Is it not I that slew a hundred governors?<BR>
Is it not I that have given a hundred veils?<BR>
Is it not I that cut off a hundred heads?<BR>
Is it not I that gave to Henpen<BR>
20 The tremendous sword of the enchanter?<BR>
Is it not I that performed the rights of purification,<BR>
When Hayarndor went to the top of the mountain?<BR>
I was bereaved to my sorrow. My confidence was commensurate.<BR>
There was not a world were it not for my progeny.<BR>
I am a bard to be praised. The unskilful<BR>
May he be possessed by the ravens and eagle and bird of wrath.<BR>
Avagddu came to him with his equal,<BR>
When the bands of four men feed between two plains,<BR>
Abiding in heaven was he, my desire,<BR>
30 Against the eagle, against the fear of the unskilful.<BR>
I am a bard, and I am a harper,<BR>
I am a piper, and I am a crowder.<BR>
Of seven score musicians the very great<BR>
Enchanter. There was of the enamelled honour the privilege,<BR>
Hu of the expanded wings. <A NAME="page_299"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 299</FONT></A><BR>
Thy son, thy barded proclamation,<BR>
Thy steward, of a gifted father.<BR>
MY tongue to recite my death-song.<BR>
If of stone-work the opposing wall of the world.<BR>
40 May the countenance of Prydain be bright for my guidance,<BR>
Sovereign of heaven, let my messages not be rejected.</P>
