### CXII.

### RED BOOK OF HERGEST X.

I. SITTING high upon a hill, battle-inclined is  
My mind, and it does not impel me onward:  
Short is my journey, my tenement is laid waste.

II\. Sharp is the gale, it is bare punishment to live;  
When the trees array themselves in gay colours  
Of summer; violently ill I am this day.

III\. I am no hunter, I keep no animal of the chase;  
I cannot move about:  
As long as it pleases the cuckoo, let her sing!

IV\. The loud-voiced cuckoo sings with the dawn,  
Her melodious notes in the dales of Cuawg:  
Better is the lavisher than the miser.

V. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing,  
On the blossom-covered branches:  
The loud-voiced cuckoo, let her sing a while!

<span id="page_581">p. 581</span>

VI\. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing,  
On the blossom-covered branches:  
Woe to the sick that hears their contented notes.

VII\. At Aber Cuawg the cuckoos sing:  
The recollection is in my mind!  
There are that hear them that will not bear them again!

VIII\. Have I not listened to the cuckoo on the ivied tree?  
Did not my shield hang down?  
What I loved is but vexation; what I loved is no more.

IX\. High above the merry oak,  
I have listened to the song of birds.  
The loud cuckoo--every one remembers what he loves.

X. Songstress with the solacing song! her voice is grief exciting:  
Subject to wander, with the flight of the hawk,  
The loquacious cuckoo at Aber Cuawg.

XI\. The birds are clamorous; humid are the glens:  
Let the moon shine; cold the midnight hour:  
Distracted is my mind from the torment of disorder.

XII\. White-topped is the cliff; long the midnight hour:  
Every ingenious one-will be honoured:  
I owe the indulgence of sleep to old age.

XIII\. The birds are clamorous; the beach is wet:  
Let the leaves fall; the exile is unconcerned:  
I will not conceal it, I am ill this night.

XIV\. The birds are clamorous; the strand is wet:  
Clear is the sky; large the wave:  
The heart is palsied with longing.

<span id="page_582">p. 582</span>

XV\. The birds are clamorous; the strand is wet:  
Conspicuous is the wave with its ample range:  
What was formed in my youth,  
I could love, if I could have it again.

XVI\. Clamorous are the birds on the scent;  
Loud the cry of dogs in a desert;  
Again clamorous are the birds.

XVII\. In the beginning of summer, gay are all varied seeds!  
When the warriors hasten to the conflict,  
I do not go, infirmity will not leave me.

XVIII\. In the beginning of summer, it is glorious on the course,  
When the warriors hasten to the field of battle;  
I shall not go, infirmity separates me.

XIX\. Hoary is the mountain summit; the tops of the ash are brittle:  
From the Abers the fair wave is impelled:  
Laughter is far from my heart.

XX\. What is it to me this day at the end of the month?  
In the social banquet I have left it:  
Distracted is my mind; a fever has made choice of me.

XXI\. Quick is the sight of the sentinel;  
Let the idle use courtesy:  
Distracted is my mind; disease preys upon me.

XXII\. Riches like a bowl encircling mead,  
The happy man will not wish for:  
It is a precious thing to know patience.

<span id="page_583">p. 583</span>

XXIII\. Riches like a bowl round the cheering beverage,  
The gliding stream, the refreshing shower,  
And the deep ford: the mind is stirred to treachery.

XXIV\. To foment treachery is an iniquitous deed;  
There will be pain where there will be purifying;  
It is to sell a little for much.

XXV\. Let the wicked be fomenting treachery;  
When God will judge, at the long day,  
Dark will be falsehood, truth clear.

XXVI\. There is danger in repelling the graduated visitor;  
Men are joyous over the beverage:  
Frail is the reed, of riches an emblem.

XXVII\. Hear the wave of sullen din, and loud,  
Amidst the pebbles and gravel:  
Distracted is my mind from delirium this night.

XXVIII\. Branching is the top of the oak; bitter the taste of the ash:  
Sweet the cow-parsnip; the wave is laughing:  
The cheek will not conceal the affliction of the heart.

XXIX\. The heaving sigh tells upon me,  
After my experience .    .    .    .    .  
God will not bestow on the wicked what is good.

XXX\. To the wicked what is good will not be given;  
But sorrow and anxiety:  
God will not undo what he is doing,

<span id="page_584">p. 584</span>

XXXI\. The son of sickness has been a brisk youth, he had  
An active share in the court of the king;  
May God be propitious to the diviner!

XXXII\. As to what is being done, it will come to pass,  
Let him that reads it consider:  
What is detested by man here, is detested by God above.
