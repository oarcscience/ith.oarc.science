<P>URIEN of the cultivated plain,<BR>
The most generous man of baptism,<BR>
Abundance has been given<BR>
To the men of earth.<BR>
As it has been gathered,<BR>
It has been scattered.<BR>
Joyful the bards of baptism<BR>
Whilst thy life continues.<BR>
There is greater joy<BR>
10 For the high-famed, and liberal of praise. <A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A><BR>
It is greater glory,<BR>
That Urien and his children should exist.<BR>
And he especially<BR>
The supreme Guledig.<BR>
In a distant city,<BR>
A principal pilgrim,<BR>
The Lloegrians know him,<BR>
When they converse.<BR>
Death they had,<BR>
20 And frequent vexation,<BR>
Burning their homesteads,<BR>
And drawing their coverings.<BR>
And loss,<BR>
And great incomprehension,<BR>
Without obtaining deliverance<BR>
From Urien Reged.<BR>
The protector of Reged,<BR>
The praise of Ior, the anchor of the country.<BR>
My inclination is on thee,<BR>
30 Of every hearing.<BR>
Heavy thy spear-throwing,<BR>
When the battle is heard,<BR>
When they resort to battle,<BR>
A smarting is made.<BR>
Fire in houses before day,<BR>
Before the sovereign of the cultivated plain,<BR>
The most fair cultivated plain,<BR>
And its most generous men.<BR>
The Angles are accustomed to be without homage<BR>
40 From most valiant king.<BR>
A most valiant progeny,<BR>
Thine is the best.<BR>
Of those who have been, or will be,<BR>
There is not thy match. <A NAME="page_346"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346</FONT></A><BR>
When he is looked upon,<BR>
Very great is the terror.<BR>
It is usual to look for him,<BR>
For an active king.<BR>
Around him a modest demeanour,<BR>
50 And the varied multitude,<BR>
The splendid prince of the North,<BR>
The choicest of princes.<BR>
And when I fail in age,<BR>
In the sore necessity of death,<BR>
May I not be smiling,<BR>
If I praise not Urien.</P>
