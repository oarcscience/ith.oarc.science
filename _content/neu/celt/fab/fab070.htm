<P>THE qualities shall be extolled<BR>
Of the man that. chained the. wind.<BR>
When his powers come,<BR>
Extremely noisy the elements;<BR>
For ever will thy impulse be,<BR>
Thou dost pervade<BR>
The tide of darkness and day.<BR>
The day, there will be a shelter to me,<BR>
The night, it will be rested. <A NAME="page_428"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 428</FONT></A><BR>
10 Softness is praised.<BR>
From a great Guledig.<BR>
The great God caused<BR>
The sun of summer, and its excessive heat;<BR>
And he caused<BR>
The abundance of the wood and field.<BR>
He is the powerful cause of the stream,<BR>
Flowing abundantly.<BR>
He is the powerful cause of every kindness;<BR>
God redeemed me<BR>
20 And before they come,<BR>
The people of the world to the one hill,<BR>
They will not be able to do the least,<BR>
Without the power of the King.<BR>
He shall steep it in the Llyn,<BR>
Until it shall sprout.<BR>
He shall steep it another time<BR>
Until it is sodden.<BR>
Not for a long time will be finished<BR>
30 What the elements produce.<BR>
Let his vessels be washed,<BR>
Let his wort be clear.<BR>
And when there shall be an exciter of song,<BR>
Let it be brought from the cell,<BR>
Let it be brought before kings.<BR>
In splendid festivals.<BR>
Will not oppose every two<BR>
The honey that made it.<BR>
God's departure in me,<BR>
40 As long as the world is in being,<BR>
The mildest is the Trinity.<BR>
The provocative of the drunkard is drunkenness.<BR>
The fishes might show<BR>
The capacity of the lodgments <A NAME="page_429"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 429</FONT></A><BR>
Of the gravel of the salt sea,<BR>
Before it overwhelms the strand.<BR>
The gravel of the salt sea<BR>
Below the sand<BR>
Will conceal me from the privileged one.<BR>
Myself he will deliver.<BR>
50 No one will be satisfied,<BR>
Without the power of the Trinity.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II.</P>
<P>Qualities they will honour<BR>
In the boundary of Garant.<BR>
The mighty ones, without desire, from the reeking<BR>
Marsh will remove,<BR>
When the string of harmony resounds,<BR>
Or the shades of night approach,<BR>
The hidden retreat from day.<BR>
Do the skilful in song know<BR>
Where the powerful artist is concealed?<BR>
10 That will give me a robe<BR>
From the gate when he ascends.<BR>
When the chief leads, in winter,<BR>
What melody is commenced together.<BR>
In choosing loud fame,<BR>
With haste the fortunate will run,<BR>
He will awake the sleeper.<BR>
He will merit Carawg<BR>
Of the many-citied Cymry,<BR>
The father of Caradawg;<BR>
20 The sound of the Meneivians,<BR>
The sound of Mynawg of Mona.<BR>
The great terrible perjured<BR>
Gwentians, long-haired.<BR>
On account of Caer Wyrangon. <A NAME="page_430"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 430</FONT></A><BR>
Who will pay the precious reward?<BR>
Is it Maelgwn from Mona?<BR>
Or shall it come from Aeron?<BR>
Or Coel or Canawon?<BR>
Or Gwrweddw or his sons?<BR>
30 His enemies shall not exult<BR>
From the hostages of Ynyr.<BR>
To him will resort the minstrels<BR>
The star of magnificent stars,<BR>
Have I not disarmed the mystery?<BR>
In Mordei Uffin,<BR>
In the seas of Gododin,<BR>
He is a sharer of varied words,<BR>
The raven of the morning divining.<BR>
I am an aged exile,<BR>
40 I am of joyful talents,<BR>
And the stroke of malice.<BR>
Mine, the praising of Urien,<BR>
Of splendid purity of life.<BR>
Very keen his conduct of hosts,<BR>
The ruddy-reaping of the steep.<BR>
Ruddyn formed them,<BR>
At the battle in Harddnenwys,<BR>
It was Ynyr that broke them to pieces.<BR>
A hundred festivals holding<BR>
50 A hundred friends be defended.<BR>
I saw mighty men,<BR>
Who hastened to the shout of war;<BR>
I saw blood on the ground<BR>
From the assault of swords.<BR>
They tinged with blue the wings of the dawn;<BR>
They threw off the spears.<BR>
Three hundred festivals complete of the renowned<BR>
Ynyr, on the earth indeed there will be redness.</P>
