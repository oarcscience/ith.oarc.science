<P>IN the morning of Saturday there was a great battle,<BR>
From when the sun rose until it gained its height.<BR>
Flamdwyn hastened in four hosts<BR>
Godeu and Reged to overwhelm.<BR>
They extended from Argoed to Arvynyd.<BR>
They retained not life during one day.<BR>
Flamdwyn called out again, of great impetuosity,<BR>
Will they give hostages? are they ready?<BR>
Owen answered, Let the gashing appear,<BR>
10 They will not give, they are not, they are not ready.<BR>
And Ceneu, son of Coel, would be an irritated lion<BR>
Before he would give a hostage to any one. <A NAME="page_366"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 366</FONT></A><BR>
Urien called out again, the lord of the cultivated region,<BR>
If there be a meeting for kindred,<BR>
Let us raise a banner above the mountain,<BR>
And advance our persons over the border.<BR>
And let us raise our spears over the heads of men,<BR>
And rush upon Flamdwyn in his army,<BR>
And slaughter with him and his followers.<BR>
20 And because of the affair of Argoed Llwyfain,<BR>
There was many a corpse.<BR>
The ravens were red from the warring of men.<BR>
And the common people hurried with the tidings.<BR>
And I will divine the year that I am not increasing.<BR>
And until I fail in old age,<BR>
In the sore necessity of death,<BR>
May I not be smiling,<BR>
If I praise not Urien.</P>
