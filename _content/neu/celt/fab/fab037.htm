<P>DISTURBED is the isle of the praise of Hu, the isle of the severe recompenser<BR>
Mona of the good bowls, of active manliness. The Menei its door.<BR>
I have drunk liquor of wine and bragget, from a brother departed.<BR>
The universal sovereign, the end of every king, the ruinator.<BR>
Sorrowful (is) the Dean, since the Archdeacon is interred.<BR>
There has not been, there will not be in tribulation his equal.<BR>
When Aeddon came from the country of Gwydyon, the thickly coveted Seon.<BR>
A pure poison came four nightly fine-night seasons.<BR>
The contemporaries fell, the woods were no shelter against the wind on the coast.<BR>
10 Math and Eunyd, skilful with the magic wand, freed the elements.<BR>
In the life of Gwydyon and Amaethon, there was counsel.<BR>
Pierced (is) the front of the shield of the strong, fortunate, strong irresistibly.<BR>
The powerful combination of his front rank, it was not of great account<BR>
Strong (in) feasting; in every assembly his will was done. <A NAME="page_300"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 300</FONT></A><BR>
Beloved he went first; while I am alive, he shall be commemorated.<BR>
May I be with Christ, so that I may not be sorrowful, when an apostle,<BR>
The generous Archdeacon amongst angels may he be contained.<BR>
Disturbed (is) the isle of the praise of Hu, the isle of the severe ruler.<BR>
Before the victorious youth, the fortress of the Cymry remained tranquil.<BR>
20 The dragon chief, a rightful proprietor in Britonia.<BR>
A sovereign is gone, alas! the chief that is gone to the earth.<BR>
Four damsels, after their lamentation, performed their office.<BR>
Very grievous truly on sea, without land, long their dwelling,<BR>
On account of his integrity (it was) that they were not satiated with distress.<BR>
I am blameable if I mention not his good actions.<BR>
In the place of Llywy, who shall prohibit, who shall order?<BR>
In the place of Aeddon, who shall support Mona's gentle authorities?<BR>
May I be with Christ, that I may not be sorrowful, for evil or good.<BR>
Share of mercy in the country of the governor of perfect life.</P>
