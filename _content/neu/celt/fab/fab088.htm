<P>ACCORDING to the sacred ode of Cyridwen, the Ogyrven of various seeds,--<BR>
The various seeds of poetic harmony, the exalted speech of the graduated minstrel,<BR>
Cuhelyn the wise, of elegant Cymraec, an exalted possession,<BR>
Will skilfully sing; the right of Aedan, the lion, shall be heard.<BR>
A song of fulness, worthy of a chair, a powerful composition it is.<BR>
From suitors may he receive eulogy, and they presents from him; <A NAME="page_501"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 501</FONT></A><BR>
The bond of sovereigns, the subject of contests in harmonious song.<BR>
Splendid are his horses, hundreds respect him, the skilful seek the chieftain,<BR>
The circle of deliverance, the nation's refuge and a treasure of mutual reproach.<BR>
10 To banter with him, who is of a venerable form, I would devoutly desire;<BR>
A broad defence, like a ship to the suppliant, and a port to the minstrel,<BR>
Quick as lightning, a powerful native, a chief whose might is sharp;<BR>
A luminary of sense, much he knows, completely he accomplishes.<BR>
May the hero of the banquet, through peace, enforce tranquillity from this day.</P>
