<P>THE Awen foretells the hastening of<BR>
The multitude, possessed of wealth and peace;<BR>
And a bountiful sovereign, and eloquent princes.<BR>
And after tranquillity, commotion in every place,<BR>
Heroic men raising a tumult of fierce contention.<BR>
Swift the remorse of defending too long.<BR>
The contention of men even to Caer Weir, the dispersion of the Allmyn.<BR>
They made great rejoicing after exhaustion,<BR>
And the reconciling of the Cymry and the men of Dublin,<BR>
10 The Gwyddyl of Iwerdon, Mona, and Prydyn,<BR>
Cornwall and Clydemen their compact with them.<BR>
The Brython will be outcasts, when they shall have done,<BR>
Far will be foretold the time they shall be.<BR>
Kings and nobles will subdue them.<BR>
The men of the North at the entry surrounding them,<BR>
In the midst of their front they will descend.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II.</P>
<P>Myrdin foretells these will meet,<BR>
In Aber Peryddon, the stewards of the kings<BR>
And though there be no right of slaughter they complain. <A NAME="page_437"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 437</FONT></A><BR>
20 Of one will of the mind they will refuse.<BR>
Stewards their taxes would collect;<BR>
In the treasures of Cymry, there was not that they would pay.<BR>
One that is a proprietor says this.<BR>
There will not come one that will pay in slavery.<BR>
The great Son of Mary declareth, when if did not break out<BR>
Against the chief of the Saxons and their fondness,<BR>
Far be the Cychmyn to Gwrtheyrn of Gwynedd.<BR>
He drove the Allmyn to banishment.<BR>
No one will attain to anything, but what earth will deprive.<BR>
30 They know not what may be passing in every outlet.<BR>
When they bought Thanet, through lack of discretion,<BR>
With Hors and Heng who were in their career,<BR>
Their prosperity has been derived from us without honour.<BR>
After a secret, the captive was worked upon at the Ynver.<BR>
Drunkenness will be pleased with much liquor of mead,<BR>
Poverty will bear with the death of many.<BR>
Terrors will bear with the tears of women;<BR>
An enervated chief will excite a wailing.<BR>
The sorrow of the world will bear with much irritation.<BR>
40 When the Cechmyu of Thanet are our kings,<BR>
May the Trinity ward off the blow that is intended.<BR>
To agitate the land of the Brython, and the Saxons at variance.<BR>
Sooner may their kings be in banishment,<BR>
Than the Cymry should go into exile.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">III.</P>
<P>The great Son of Mary declareth, when will not break out<BR>
The Cymry against the surmise of a baron, and princes;<BR>
Foremost ones in asking, examples, one law they complain,<BR>
One meeting, one council, of one voice they are.<BR>
There were none, however great, who did not speak. <A NAME="page_438"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 438</FONT></A><BR>
50 Except to dispense with surmises they would not agree.<BR>
To God and David they recommended themselves.<BR>
Let him pay, let him refrain from a refusal to Allmyn.<BR>
Let them make ill reports of the wants of the townsman.<BR>
The Cymry will meet the Saxons.<BR>
For various mutual consumption and resistance.<BR>
Of the excessively great army, when they have experience,<BR>
And on the hill, at the blades and shout, they will tremble,<BR>
And on the Gwy severe rencounters will follow them.<BR>
And a banner will come, rough it will descend.<BR>
60 And like the budded blossoms the Saxons will fall.<BR>
The Cymry gathering strength with union of actions.<BR>
First and last the Granwynyon were in a strait,<BR>
The stewards to the value of their deceit prostrating them.<BR>
Their army in the running of blood surrounding them.<BR>
Others on their feet through woods will retreat.<BR>
Through the ramparts of the city they will flee.<BR>
A war without returning to the land of Prydyn.<BR>
The council will be broken by hand, like the sea they will glide away.<BR>
The stewards of Caer Ceri dishonoured complain.<BR>
70 Some the valley and hill do not decline,<BR>
To Aber Peryddon they came not well.<BR>
Tremendous taxes they collect.<BR>
Nine score hundred men they descend.<BR>
Great mockery, except four, they did not return.<BR>
Tranquillity to their wives they say,<BR>
Their shirts full of gore they wash.<BR>
The Cymry, foremost in asking, profuse of soul,<BR>
The men of the South will defend their taxes,<BR>
With sharp-ground blades utterly they will kill.<BR>
80 There will be no advantage to the physician from what they do.<BR>
The armies of Cadwaladyr, mighty they come, <A NAME="page_439"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 439</FONT></A><BR>
The Cymry were exalted, a battle they made.<BR>
A slaughter without measure they assailed.<BR>
In the end of their taxes, death they know.<BR>
Others, large branches they planted.<BR>
For age of ages their taxes they will not leave off.<BR>
In wood, in plain, on hill,<BR>
A candle in the dark will go with them.<BR>
Cynan opening a forward way in every descent.<BR>
90 Saxons against the Brython, woe they will sing.<BR>
Cadwaladyr a pillar with his princes.<BR>
Though prudence utterly attending to them.<BR>
When they drop their covering over their support.<BR>
In affliction, and the crimson gore on the cheeks of the Allmyn.<BR>
At the end of every expedition spoil they lead.<BR>
The Saxon on journey as far as Caer Wynt formerly who sooner skulked?<BR>
Happy they, the Cymry, when they say,<BR>
The Trinity delivered us from the former trouble.<BR>
Let not Dyved or Glywyssyg tremble.<BR>
100 The praise of stewards will not affect kings,<BR>
Nor shall the councils of the Saxons obtain what they say.<BR>
Meads shall not cause drunkenness with us,<BR>
Without the payment by fate of what we have.<BR>
From orphaned sons and others a few<BR>
Through the intercession of David and the saints of Prydeyn,<BR>
As far as the stream of Arlego they will flee out.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">IV.</P>
<P>The Awen foretells, the day will come,<BR>
When he will come to summon to one council,<BR>
One company, one council, and Lloegyr being burnt, <A NAME="page_440"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 440</FONT></A><BR>
110 In the hope of detracting our most comely army.<BR>
And the song of another country will flee always.<BR>
He knows not a hiding-place for my goods, and where will be a shelter?<BR>
They raise a barking, like a bear from the mountain.<BR>
To pay flattery their country will bleed.<BR>
Again shall come the toil of spears, fierce and sharp:<BR>
The friend shall not spare the body of his companion.<BR>
Again shall come the head of a salmon without brains;<BR>
Again shall come widowed women and spare horses.<BR>
Again shall come a terrible shout from the assault of the warriors,<BR>
120 And many hands unequal before scattering armies.<BR>
The messengers of death met together,<BR>
When stood carcases according to their origin,<BR>
The tax will be avenged and the value daily,<BR>
And the many messages on the false army.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">V.</P>
<P>The Cymry have prevailed through the rencounter,<BR>
Completely unanimous: of one voice, of one faith.<BR>
The Cymry have prevailed to cause battle.<BR>
And the tribes of many a country they will collect,<BR>
And the holy banner of David they will raise,<BR>
130 To lead the Gwyddyl through the dark blue sea.<BR>
And the faction of Dublin with us stood,<BR>
When they come to the battle, they will not deny themselves;<BR>
They will ask the Saxons what they seek:<BR>
How much of debt from the country they hold?<BR>
Whence is their route when they settled?<BR>
Whence their generation? from what land did they come?<BR>
Since the time of Gwrtheyrn they trample upon us.<BR>
Truth will not be obtained in the land of discord.<A NAME="page_441"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 441</FONT></A><BR>
Did they not trample entirely on the privilege of our saints?<BR>
140 Did they not entirely break through the miracles of David?<BR>
The Cymry will keep themselves, when they visit.<BR>
The Allmyn will not go from the places they stand on,<BR>
Until they shall have paid seven times the value of what they did.<BR>
And death shall scatter to the value of their wrong.<BR>
The kin of Garmawn will pay of honour,<BR>
In four years and four hundred.<BR>
Valiant men long-haired, the Lord will incite:<BR>
And a driving of the Saxons from Iwerdon there will be.<BR>
Thence will come from Lengo, a wanton fleet,<BR>
150 The battle was ruined, the armies were torn.<BR>
There will come from Alclud, men, bold, faithful,<BR>
To drive from Prydein bright armies.<BR>
There will come from Llydaw, a seasonable ally,<BR>
Warriors from their war-horses will not regard their origin.<BR>
Saxons on all sides into disgrace will come;<BR>
Their age has passed away; there is not a country.<BR>
Death has been accomplished to the black auxiliary.<BR>
Disease and duty will deliver us,<BR>
After gold and silver and what is congenial.<BR>
160 Let a bush be their shelter in reward of their bad faith.<BR>
Let the sea be, let an anchor be, their counsellors.<BR>
let gore be, let death be, their auxiliary.<BR>
Cynan and Cadwaladyr, mighty in armies;<BR>
They will, be honoured until judgment: prosperity will attend them.<BR>
Two tenacious chiefs; profound their counsel.<BR>
Two that will overcome the Saxons, with the aid of the Lord.<BR>
Two generous ones, two treasurers of a merchant's country. <A NAME="page_442"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 442</FONT></A><BR>
Two fearless ones, ready, of one fortune, of one faith.<BR>
Two exalters of Prydein of bright armies.<BR>
170 Two bears do not know shame barking daily.<BR>
Druids foretell what great things will happen.<BR>
From Mynaw to Llydaw in their hands will be.<BR>
From Dyved to Thanet they will possess.<BR>
From the light to the ground along their Abers.<BR>
Their chief partly paid for the land.<BR>
A nakedness on Cynon, Saxons will not be.<BR>
The Gwyddyl will return to their native country,<BR>
The Cymry will raise up a mighty auxiliary.<BR>
Armies about ale from the tumult of soldiers.<BR>
180 And the kings of God that have kept their faith<BR>
Will summon to every fleet: trouble will end;<BR>
And Cynan will reconcile them with each other.<BR>
Cynon will not call in as combatants,<BR>
Save the Cechmyn of Cadwaladyr, and his merchants.<BR>
Like a Cymro, joyful of speech he will be,<BR>
About the afflicted isle swarms will cease;<BR>
When the carcases stand according to their race,<BR>
Even to Aber Santwic it will be noised,<BR>
That the Allmyn are about to emigrate abroad,<BR>
190 One after another, breaking afresh upon their race.<BR>
The Saxons at anchor on the sea always,<BR>
The Cymry venerable until doomsday shall be supreme<BR>
They will not seek books nor be covetous of poets.<BR>
The presage of this isle will be no other than this.<BR>
We will praise the King that created heaven and earth.<BR>
May David be a leader to the combatants.<BR>
Ynyr in Gelli Caer for God be is;<BR>
He will not die, he will not run away, he will not exhaust;<BR>
He will not fade, he will not fail, he will not bend, he will not tremble.</P>
