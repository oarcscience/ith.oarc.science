<P>ON the face of the earth his equal was not born,<BR>
Three persons of God, one Son gentle, strong Trinity.<BR>
Son of the Godhead, Son of the Manhood, one son wonderful.<BR>
Son of God, a fortress, Son of the blessed Mary, a good son to see. <A NAME="page_558"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 558</FONT></A><BR>
Great his destiny, great God supreme, a glorious portion.<BR>
Of the race of Adam, and Abraham he was born.<BR>
Of the race of the Lord, a portion of the eloquent host, was he born.<BR>
He brought by a word the blind and deaf from every ailment.<BR>
A people gluttonous, vain, iniquitous, vile, perverse,<BR>
10 We have risen against the Trinity, after redemption,<BR>
The Cross of Christ clearly, a breastplate gleaming against every ailment.<BR>
Against every hardship may it be certainly a city of protection.</P>
