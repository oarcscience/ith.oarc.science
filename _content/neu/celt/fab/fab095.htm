<P>HAIL, glorious Lord!<BR>
May church and chancel bless Thee!'<BR>
And chancel and church!<BR>
And plain and precipice!<BR>
And the three fountains there are,<BR>
Two above wind, and one above the earth,<BR>
May darkness and light bless Thee!<BR>
And fine silk and sweet trees!<BR>
Abraham the chief of faith did bless Thee.<BR>
10 And life eternal.<BR>
And birds find bees.<BR>
And old and young.<BR>
Aaron and Moses did bless Thee.<BR>
And male and female.<BR>
And the seven days and the stars.<BR>
And the air and the ether.<BR>
And books and letters.<BR>
And fish in the flowing water.<BR>
And song and deed.<BR>
20 And sand and sward.<BR>
And such as were satisfied with good.<BR>
I will bless Thee, glorious Lord!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, glorious Lord!</P>
