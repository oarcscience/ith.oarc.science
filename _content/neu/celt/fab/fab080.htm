<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>THE man that speaks from the grave<BR>
Has been instructed that before seven years,<BR>
The horse of Eurdein of the North will die.</P>
<P>II. I have quaffed wine from a bright glass<BR>
With the lords of fierce war;<BR>
My name is Myrdin, son of Morvryn.</P>
<P>III. I have quaffed wine from a goblet<BR>
With the lords of devouring war;<BR>
Myrdin is my deserving name.</P>
<P>IV. When opposition will come upon a black wheel,<BR>
To destroy Lloegyr of exhausted course,<BR>
Bitter will be their enmity in defending<BR>
The White Mount; at the White Mount distress there will be,<BR>
And long regret to the nation of the Cymry.</P>
<P>V. There will be no protection in the recesses of Ardudwy,<BR>
In the maritime region of the Cymry,<BR>
From the renowned Boar of the intrepid host.</P>
<P>VI. When the red one of Normandy will come<BR>
To charge the Lloegrians with enormous expense, <A NAME="page_479"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 479</FONT></A><BR>
There will be a tax upon every prediction,<BR>
And a castle at Aber Hodni.</P>
<P>VII. When the strong-freckled one will come<BR>
As far as Ryd Bengarn,<BR>
Men will be disgraced, hilts worn out:<BR>
The chief noble of Prydein will be their chief in judgment.</P>
<P>VIII. When Henri will come to claim<BR>
Mur Castell on the border of Eryri,<BR>
Disturbance beyond sea will call him.</P>
<P>IX. When the pale weak one will come to claim London,<BR>
Upon unhandsome horses,<BR>
He will call forth the lordship of Caergein.</P>
<P>X. Scarce the acorns, thick the corn,<BR>
When there will suddenly appear<BR>
A king, a youth, woo to such as tremble!</P>
<P>XI. There will be a youth of great renown,<BR>
Who will conquer a thousand cities;<BR>
Like the life of tender shoots will be that of the king I from a youth.</P>
<P>XII. Strong towards the weak will he be,<BR>
Weak towards the strong of the uplands;--<BR>
A ruler from whose coming worse it will fare.</P>
<P>XIII. There will be a state when they will delight in wantonness,<BR>
When women will be a soft herd,<BR>
And a host of young children at confession.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_480"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 480</FONT></A></P>
<P>XIV. There will be a state when they will delight in order;<BR>
Even the churl will do a good turn;<BR>
The maid will be handsome, and the youth resolute.</P>
<P>XV. There will be a state towards the end of the age,<BR>
When from adversity the young will fail,<BR>
And in May cuckoos die of cold.</P>
<P>XVI. There will be a state when they will delight in hunting-dogs,<BR>
And build in intricate places<BR>
And a shirt without great cost cannot be obtained.</P>
<P>XVII. There will be a state when they will delight in oaths;<BR>
Vice will be active, and churches neglected;<BR>
Words as well as relies will be broken,<BR>
Truth will disappear, and falsehood spread<BR>
Faith will be weak, and disputings on alternate days.</P>
<P>XVIII. There will be a state when they will delight in clothes;<BR>
The counsellor of a lord will be a vagrant of a bailiff;<BR>
Empty-handed the bard, gay the priest;<BR>
Men will be despised, refusals frequent.</P>
<P>XIX. There will be a state without wind, without rain,<BR>
Without too much ploughing, without too much consuming,<BR>
Land enough will one acre be for nine.</P>
<P>XX. When the men will come without manliness,<BR>
And corn grow in the place of trees,<BR>
In peace everywhere feasts will be prevalent.</P>
<P>XXI. When the cubit shall be held in esteem, trees in spring<BR>
There will be after the chief of mischief:<BR>
Let the cowhouse post be worse than a coulter.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_481"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 481</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXII. Wednesday, a day of enmity,<BR>
Blades will be completely worn out;<BR>
They will conceal two in the blood of Cynghen.</P>
<P>XXIII. In Aber Sor there will be a council,<BR>
On men after the devastation of battle,<BR>
A happy ruler is a leader in the camp.</P>
<P>XXIV. In Aber Avon will be the host of Mona,<BR>
And Angles after that will be at Hinwedon;<BR>
His valour will Moryon long preserve.</P>
<P>XXV. In Aber Dwvyr the leader will not hold out,<BR>
When that which will be performed by Gwidig will take place,<BR>
And after the battle of Cyvarllug.</P>
<P>XXVI. A battle will be on the river Byrri,<BR>
And the Brython will be victorious;<BR>
The men of Gwhyr will perform acts of heroism.</P>
<P>XXVII. In Aber Don a battle will ensue,<BR>
And the shafts will be unequal,<BR>
And crimson blood on the brow of Saxons.<BR>
Servile is thy cry, thou Gwendydd!<BR>
Have told it me the ghosts<BR>
Of the mountain, in Aber Carav.</P>
