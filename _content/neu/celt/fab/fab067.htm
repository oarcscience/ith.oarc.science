<P ALIGN="CENTER">HERE BEGINNETH THE GORCHAN OF TUDVWLCH.</P>
<P>THEY assemble in arms, the ranks are formed, tumult approaches;<BR>
In front are the warlike, in front the noble, in front the good;<BR>
While the trenches are full of motion, around are heard the curved horns, and are seen the curved falchions;<BR>
To the praise of the king with the host whose presence is devastation.<BR>
I saw dark gore arising on the stalks of plants, on the clasp of the fetter,<BR>
On the bunches, on the sovereign, on the bush, and the spear:<BR>
And ruddy was the sea-beach; and on the sea-beach, and in Ewionydd<BR>
And Gwynheidyd splendid excess prevailed.<BR>
The crowd made a firm stay before the ceremony, like the checking of excess.<BR>
10 Uplifted were the shields around the front of the aged when the excess prevailed.<BR>
A wolf in his lifetime was Bleiddiad, unrestrained in his bravery.<BR>
Active were the glittering shafts with the aspect of a serpent, from the radiance of serpents.<BR>
Wounded thou art, commander of rulers, and delight of females.<BR>
Thou lovedst partly to live: I wish thou livedst, O thou of victorious energy! <A NAME="page_411"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 411</FONT></A><BR>
Unjustly oppressed bull (of conflict), I deplore thy death, thou who wert fond of the tumult!<BR>
In the face of the sea, in the front rank of men, around the pit of battle<BR>
Bran combats in Cynwyd.<BR>
A wave burst forth which afflicted the world.<BR>
He refused to the tribes of the country, and for the benefit of the infantry,<BR>
20 Four multitudes, four military troops of the world.<BR>
The shields were in splinters, and the blade in the hair of one from the square,<BR>
The man who poured the expressed mead out of the blue horns,<BR>
A man of quality, surrounded with purple, the stay or armies.<BR>
It was the performance of Tudvwlch of severe aspect, whose standard was of the colour of the blood of grapes.<BR>
By reason of mead free drunk, a multitude went over the boundary.<BR>
In the action at the goal, for the preservation of law.<BR>
Cynan, the energetic chief from Mona, acted justly as regards the higher orders.<BR>
Tudvwlch and Cyvwlch made breaches in the heights of Caers;<BR>
With Mynyddawg disastrous did their wassails prove.<BR>
30 A year of longing for the men of Catraeth is cherished by me;--<BR>
Their steel blades, their mead, their vehemence, and their fetters.<BR>
They assemble in arms, the ranks are formed; do I not hear the tumult?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">AND SO IT ENDETH.</P>
