<P>THE eternal Trinity<BR>
Made the element, <A NAME="page_565"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 565</FONT></A><BR>
And after the element,<BR>
Adam wonderfully.<BR>
And after Adam,<BR>
Well he made Eva.<BR>
The blessed Israel<BR>
The mighty Spirit made.<BR>
Ardent the suggestion,<BR>
10 Clear the reasoning.<BR>
Twelve towns of Israel, rising equally high,<BR>
Twelve sons of Israel, the generous God made.<BR>
Twelve sons of Israel were nursed together.<BR>
Twelve good, blameless, three mothers nursed them.<BR>
One person created them, the Creator made them.<BR>
As he will do as he pleases, who is supreme.<BR>
Twelve sons of Israel made the love-diffuser.<BR>
As he will do as he pleases, who is Lord.<BR>
Twelve sons of Israel made the Lord.<BR>
20 As he will do as he pleases, who is skilful.<BR>
Twelve-sons of Israel bore reward<BR>
Of the mission of Jesus.<BR>
And one father there was to them.<BR>
And three mothers to them.<BR>
From them came grace<BR>
And good offspring.<BR>
And Mary, good, created,<BR>
And Christ, my strengthener,<BR>
Lord of every fair country,<BR>
30 And I will call on and sing to thee every day;<BR>
For has been my desire<BR>
Friendship with thee.</P>
