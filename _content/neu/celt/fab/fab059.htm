<P>IN manliness he will greet my trouble,<BR>
Should I be bled, I should evidently get better;<BR>
Truly I saw. no one before, who saw not in me<BR>
Every indisposition, he will cultivate his business.<BR>
I saw a feeding about a lion for plants,<BR>
I saw leaves of luxuriant growth.<BR>
I saw a branch with equal blossoms.<BR>
Did I not see a prince? most liberal his customs, <A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A><BR>
I saw the ruler of Catraeth beyond the plains<BR>
10 Be my oak <I>(i.e.</I> prince) the gleaming spirit (<I>i.e.</I> lightning) of the Cymry.<BR>
The value of my cry great will be its advantage to degrees.<BR>
The chief of men, shield of warriors.<BR>
The extensive booty of the ashen shaft is my fair Awen.<BR>
A shield before a prince, bright his smile,<BR>
Heroic, aspiring, the most heroic is Urien.<BR>
A merchant will not oppose me. Tumultuous<BR>
The slothful one, brightly shines the blue of the enamelled covering; prolific and highly exalted<BR>
Every one; a step without skill on the side of the watery fronts of the Mordei.<BR>
A chief excessively active to us he will come of thy will.<BR>
20 Active the yellow-gray one in the hall.<BR>
Full of people. A protector in Aerou.<BR>
Great his energy, his poets, and his musicians,<BR>
Very fierce is Ial against his enemies.<BR>
May great strength of men be connected with Brython.<BR>
Like the wheeling of a fiery meteor over the earth.<BR>
Like a wave that governs Llwyvenydd.<BR>
Like the harmonious ode of Gwen and Gweithen,<BR>
Like Mor the greatly courteous is Urien.<BR>
In his early career an intrepid hero.<BR>
30 He is such a ruler of kings as Dyawr,<BR>
He is one (i.e. unequalled) as a chaser of the swift horses of the multitude.<BR>
In the beginning of May in Powys, in battle array,<BR>
He is one, coming when he visits his people.<BR>
Eagle of the land, extensive thy glance.<BR>
I would have requested an active courser<BR>
Of vigorous trot, the price of the spoil of Taliessin.<BR>
One is the violent course on the bottom and the summit, <A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A><BR>
One is the gift of a baron to a lord.<BR>
One is the herd of stags in their flight,<BR>
40 One is the wolf not covetous of broom,<BR>
One is the country where a son is born,<BR>
And of one form and one sound is the battle-place of warriors.<BR>
Of one sound they will evilly yoke<BR>
And Ceneu and Nudd Hael, and an extensive country under him.<BR>
And if I obtain for myself a smile,<BR>
He will make the bards ever joyful,<BR>
Before that I could wish dead the sons of Gwyden,<BR>
May the happy country of Urien be filled with blood.</P>
