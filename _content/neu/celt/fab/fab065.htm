<P>I. SWEET appletree of delightful branches,<BR>
Budding luxuriantly, and shooting forth renowned scions,<BR>
I will predict before the owner of Machreu,<BR>
That in the valley of Machawy on Wednesday there will be blood,--<BR>
Joy to Lloegyr of the blood-red blades.<BR>
Rear, O little pig! there will come on Thursday<BR>
Joy to the Cymry of mighty battles,<BR>
In their defence of Cymminawd, with their incessant sword-thrusts.<BR>
On the Saxons there will be a slaughter with ashen spears,<BR>
And their heads will be used as balls to play with.<BR>
I prophesy truth without disguise,--<BR>
The elevation of a child in a secluded part of the South.</P>
<P>II. Sweet appletree, a green tree of luxurious growth,<BR>
How large are its branches, and beautiful its form!<BR>
And I will predict a battle that will make me shriek<BR>
At Pengwern, in the sovereign feast, mead is appropriate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>

<P>III. Sweet appletree, and a yellow tree;<BR>
Grow at Tal Ardd, without a garden surrounding it;<BR>
And I will predict a battle in Prydyn,<BR>
In defence of their frontier against the men of Dublin;<BR>
Seven ships will come over the wide lake,<BR>
And seven hundred over the sea to conquer.<BR>
Of those that come, none will go to Cennyn,<BR>
Except seven half-empty ones, according to the prediction.</P>
<P>IV. Sweet appletree that luxuriantly grows!<BR>
Food I used to take at it base to please a fair maid,<BR>
When, with my shield on my shoulder, and my sword on my thigh,<BR>
I slept all alone in the woods of Celyddon.<BR>
Hear, O little pig! now apply thyself to reason,<BR>
And listen to birds whose notes. are pleasant,<BR>
Sovereigns across the sea will come on Monday;<BR>
Blessed will the Cymry be, from that design.</P>
<P>V. Sweet appletree that grows in the glade!<BR>
Their vehemence will conceal it from the lords of Rydderch,<BR>
Trodden it is around its base, and men are about it.<BR>
Terrible to them were heroic forms.<BR>
Gwendydd loves me not, greets me not;<BR>
I am hated by the firmest minister of Rydderch;<BR>
I have ruined his son and his daughter.<BR>
Death takes all away, why does he not visit me?<BR>
For after Gwenddoleu no princes honour me;<BR>
I am not soothed with diversion, I am not visited by the fair;<BR>
Yet in the battle of Ardderyd golden was my torques,<BR>
Though I am now despised by her who is of the colour of swans.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_372"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 372</FONT></A></P>
<P>VI. Sweet appletree of delicate bloom,<BR>
That grows in concealment in the woods!<BR>
At break of day the tale was told me,<BR>
That the firmest minister is offended at my creed,<BR>
Twice, thrice, four times, in one day.<BR>
O Jesus! would that my end had come<BR>
Before the death of the son of Gwendydd happen on my hand!</P>
<P>VII. Sweet appletree, which grows by the river-side!<BR>
With respect to it, the keeper will not thrive on its splendid fruit.<BR>
While my reason was not aberrant, I used to be around its stem<BR>
With a fair sportive maid, a paragon of slender form.<BR>
Ten years and forty, as the toy of lawless ones,<BR>
Have I been wandering in gloom and among sprites.<BR>
After wealth in abundance and entertaining minstrels,<BR>
I have been (here so long that) it is useless for gloom and sprites to lead me astray.<BR>
I will not sleep, but tremble on account of my leader,<BR>
My lord Gwenddoleu, and those who are natives of my country.<BR>
After suffering disease and longing grief about the words of Celyddon,<BR>
May I become a blessed servant of the Sovereign of splendid retinues!</P>
<P>VIII. Sweet appletree of delicate blossoms,<BR>
Which grows in the soil amid the trees!<BR>
The Sibyl foretells a tale that will come to pass--<BR>
A golden rod of great value, will, for bravery,<BR>
Be given to glorious chiefs before the dragons;<BR>
The diffuser of grace will vanquish the profane man. <A NAME="page_373"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 373</FONT></A><BR>
Before the child, bold as the sun in his courses,<BR>
Saxons shall be eradicated, and bards shall flourish.</P>
<P>IX. Sweet appletree, and a tree of crimson hue,<BR>
Which grow in concealment in the wood of Celyddon;<BR>
Though sought for their fruit, it will be in vain,<BR>
Until Cadwaladyr comes from the conference of Cadvaon,<BR>
To the Eagle of Tywi and Teiwi rivers;<BR>
And until fierce anguish comes from Aranwynion,<BR>
And the wild and long-haired ones are made tame:</P>
<P>X. Sweet appletree, and a tree of crimson hue,<BR>
Which grow in concealment in the wood of Celyddon;<BR>
Though sought for their fruit, it will be in vain,<BR>
Until Cadwaladyr comes from the conference of Rhyd Rheon,<BR>
And Cynan to meet him advances upon the Saxons;<BR>
The Cymry will be victorious, glorious will be their leader.<BR>
All shall have their rights, and the Brython will rejoice,<BR>
Sounding the horns of gladness, and chanting the song of peace and happiness!</P>
