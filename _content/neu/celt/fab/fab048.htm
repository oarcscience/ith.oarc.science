<P>I. I WAS formerly fair of limb, I was eloquent in speech:<BR>
What is not wonderful will be extolled<BR>
The men of Argoed have ever supported me.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A></P>
<P>II. I was formerly fair of limb, I was bold,<BR>
I was admitted into the congress-house<BR>
Of Powys, the paradise of the Cymry.</P>
<P>III. I was formerly fair of limb, I was comely;<BR>
Throbbing was concomitant with my spear:<BR>
My back (now) curved was first in vigour--I am heavy, I am wretched.</P>
<P>IV. Wooden crook! is it not the time of harvest,<BR>
When the fern is brown, and the reeds are yellow?<BR>
Have I not once disliked what I now love!</P>
<P>V. Wooden crook! is not this winter,<BR>
When men are noisy over the beverage?<BR>
Is not my bedside void of greeting visits!</P>
<P>VI. Wooden crook! is it not the spring,<BR>
When the cuckoos are brownish, when the foam is bright?<BR>
I am destitute of a maiden's love.</P>
<P>VII. Wooden crook! is it not the beginning of summer,<BR>
Are not the furrows brown, are not the corn-blades curled?<BR>
It is refreshing to me to look at thy beak!</P>
<P>VIII. Wooden crook! thou contented branch<BR>
That supportest a mourning old man!<BR>
Llywarch of pleasant talk!</P>
<P>IX. Wooden crook! thou hardy branch<BR>
That bearest with me--God protect thee!<BR>
Thou art justly called the tree of wandering.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_328"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 328</FONT></A></P>
<P>X. Wooden crook! be thou steady,<BR>
So that thou mayest support me the better--<BR>
Am not I Llywarch known to many far away?</P>
<P>XI. Surely old age is uniting itself with me,<BR>
From my hair to my teeth,<BR>
And the glowing eyeball which the young ones loved!</P>
<P>XII. Surely old age is uniting itself with me,<BR>
From my hair to my teeth,<BR>
And the glowing eyeball which the women loved!</P>
<P>XIII. The wind grinningly blusters out, white is the skirt of the wood,<BR>
Lively is the stag, there is no moisture on the hill;<BR>
Feeble is the aged, slowly he moves!</P>
<P>XIV. This leaf, is it not driven by the wind?<BR>
Woe to it as to its fate!<BR>
It is old, this year was it born.</P>
<P>XV. What I loved when a youth are hateful to me now:<BR>
A stranger's daughter, and a gray steed.<BR>
Am not I for them unmeet?</P>
<P>XVI. The four most hateful things to me through life,<BR>
Have met together with one accord:--<BR>
Cough and old age, sickness and grief.</P>
<P>XVII. I am old, I am lonely, I am decrepit and cold,<BR>
After the sumptuous bed of honour:<BR>
I am wretched, I am triply bent!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_329"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 329</FONT></A></P>
<P>XVIII. I am triply bent and old, I am fickly bold,<BR>
I am rash, I am outrageous:<BR>
Those that loved me, love me not.</P>
<P>XIX. Young maidens love me not, I am visited by none,<BR>
I cannot move about--<BR>
Ah! death, that he does not seek me!</P>
<P>XX. I am sought by neither sleep nor gladness;<BR>
After the slaughter of Llawr and Gwen,<BR>
I am outrageous and loathsome, I am old.</P>
<P>XXI. Wretched was the fate decreed to Llywarch<BR>
On the night he was born;<BR>
Long pain without being delivered of his load of trouble.</P>
<P>XXII. Array not thyself after waiting; let not thy mind be vexed;<BR>
Sharp is the gale, and bleak the spring!--<BR>
Accuse me not, my mother--I am thy son!</P>
<P>XXIII. Do I not recognise by my Awen,<BR>
My descent, sway, and kindred:<BR>
Three themes of the harmonious Awen?</P>
<P>XXIV. Sharp is my spear, furious in the onset;<BR>
I will prepare to watch the ford;<BR>
Support against falling may God grant me.</P>
<P>XXV. Shouldst thou run away, I will weep for thee;<BR>
Shouldst thou be slain, I shall mourn thee:<BR>
Lose not the countenance of the men of conflict.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXVI. I will not lose thy countenance, prone to warfare,<BR>
From the time that the hero puts on harness for the course;<BR>
I will hear the pang ere I quit the spot.</P>
<P>XXVII. Gliding is the wave along the beach;<BR>
I perceive that the design of that battle will be frustrated,<BR>
It is usual for the talkative to run away.</P>
<P>XXVIII. Of that which concerns me I will speak;<BR>
There is breaking of spears about the place where I am;<BR>
I will not say but that I may retreat.</P>
<P>XXIX. Soft is the bog, the cliff is hard,<BR>
Before the hart's hoof the edge of the bank breaks,<BR>
A promise not fulfilled is none at all.</P>
<P>XXX. The streams will divide around the wall of the Caer,<BR>
And I will prognosticate--<BR>
A shield with a fractured front before I skulk.</P>
<P>XXXI. The horn given to thee by Urien,<BR>
With the wreath of gold around its rim,<BR>
Blow in it, if thou art in danger.</P>
<P>XXXII. For the terror of death from the base men of Lloegyr<BR>
I will. not tarnish my honour;<BR>
I will not dispraise maidens.</P>
<P>XXXIII. Whilst I was of the age of yonder youth,<BR>
That wears the golden spurs,<BR>
I was active in thrusting the spear.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_331"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 331</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXXIV. Truly thy young man is faithful,<BR>
Thou art alive, and thy witness is slain,<BR>
The old man that is now feeble was not so in his youth.</P>
<P>XXXV. Gwen, by the Llawen, watched last night,<BR>
And success did not fail him:<BR>
The battle progressed on the green embankment.</P>
<P>XXXVI. Gwen, by the Llawen, watched last night,<BR>
With the shield on the shoulder;<BR>
As he was my son, he did not retreat.</P>
<P>XXXVII. Gwen with the lowering look, troubled is my mind,<BR>
Thy death greatly provokes my wrath--<BR>
It is not kindred (only) that will speak of thee!</P>
<P>XXXVIII. Gwen with thigh of wide opening watched last night<BR>
On the border of the ford of Morlas;<BR>
And as he was my son, he did not retreat.</P>
<P>XXXIX. Gwen, I knew thy inherent disposition;<BR>
In the assault like the eagle at fall of rivers thou wert;<BR>
If I were fortunate thou wouldst have escaped.</P>
<P>XL. Let the face of the ground be turned up, let the assailants be covered,<BR>
When chiefs repair to the toil of war;<BR>
Gwen, woe to him that is over old, for thee he is indignant.</P>
<P>XLI. Let the face of the ground be turned up, and the plain be covered,<BR>
When the opposing spears are lifted up.<BR>
Gwen, woe to him that is over old, that he should have lost thee.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_332"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 332</FONT></A></P>
<P>XLII. My son was a man, splendid was his fame;<BR>
And he was the nephew of Urien;<BR>
On the ford of Morlas, Gwen was slain.</P>
<P>XLIII. The shrine of the fierce overbearing foe,<BR>
That vanquished the circularly compact army of Lloegr;<BR>
The grave of Gwen, the son of Llywarch Hen, is this!</P>
<P>XLIV. Four-and-twenty sons have been to me,<BR>
Wearing the golden chain, leaders of armies;<BR>
Gwen was the best of them.</P>
<P>XLV. Four-and-twenty sons have been to me,<BR>
Wearing the golden chain, leaders of battle;<BR>
Gwen was the best son of his father.</P>
<P>XLVI. Four-and-twenty sons to me have been,<BR>
Wearing the golden chain, leading princes;<BR>
Compared with Gwen they were but striplings.</P>
<P>XLVII. Four-and-twenty sons were in the family of Llywarch,<BR>
Of brave men fall of the wrath of war;<BR>
Their march was a rush, immense their fame.</P>
<P>XLVIII. Four-and-twenty were my sons complete;<BR>
My flesh they have caused to wither;<BR>
It is well that my budget of misfortune is come!</P>
<P>XLIX When Pyll was slain, gashing was the wound;<BR>
And the blood on the hair seemed horrible;<BR>
And on both banks of the Ffraw there was violence.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_333"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 333</FONT></A></P>
<P>L. A room might be formed for the wings of shields,<BR>
Which would hold one standing upright,<BR>
That were broken in the grasp of Pyll.</P>
<P>LI. The chosen man amongst my sons,<BR>
When each assaulted the foe,<BR>
Was fair Pyll, impetuous as a fire through a chimney.</P>
<P>LII. Gracefully he placed his thigh over the saddle.<BR>
Of his horse, on the near and far side--<BR>
Pyll, impetuous as the fire through a chimney.</P>
<P>LIII. He was gentle, with a hand eager for battle;<BR>
He was second to no treasure;<BR>
He was a bulwark on the course--<BR>
Fair Pyll! fearful is his covering of separation.</P>
<P>LIV. When he stood at the door of his tent,<BR>
On the dark-gray steed,<BR>
At the sight, the wife of Pyll would recognise a hero.</P>
<P>LV. There was fractured before Pyll a strong skull;<BR>
Seldom would the silent coward be concealed from him;<BR>
The weak is satisfied without anything.</P>
<P>LVI. Fair Pyll, widely spread his fame:<BR>
Am. I not invigorated since thou hast existed<BR>
As my son, and joyful to have known thee?</P>
<P>LVII. The best three men under heaven<BR>
That guarded their habitation,--<BR>
Pyll, and Selyv, and Sandev.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A></P>
<P>LVIII. A shield I gave to Pyll;<BR>
Before he slept was it not perforated?<BR>
To promise it carelessly was to depreciate it.</P>
<P>LIX. Should Cymry come, and the predatory host of Lloegr,<BR>
And many from distant parts,<BR>
Pyll would show them conduct.</P>
<P>LX. Nor Pyll nor Madawg would be long lived,<BR>
If they preserved the custom.<BR>
Would they surrender? they would not surrender! they would never ask for truce!</P>
<P>LXI. Behold here the grave of a faultless one and warlike;<BR>
With the Bards his fame went, where would not have gone,<BR>
Pyll, if longer he had continued?</P>
<P>LXII. Maen, and Madawg, and Medel, valiant men,<BR>
And brothers not refractory,<BR>
Selyv, Heilyn, Llawr, and Lliver.</P>
<P>LXIII. The grave of Gwell is in Rhiw Velen;<BR>
The grave of Sawyl in Llangollen;<BR>
Llawr protects the pass of Llorien,</P>
<P>LXIV. The grave of Rhudd, is it not covered with sods?<BR>
The earth of Ammarch does not conceal<BR>
The grave of Llyngedwy, the son of Llywarch.</P>
<P>LXV. Far from hence is Aber Llyw,<BR>
Farther are the two Cyvedliws:<BR>
Talan, thou hast repaid my tears to-day.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_335"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 335</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXVI. I have drunk wine from the goblet;<BR>
He would rush forward against the lance-bearer;<BR>
Like the wings of the dawn were the gleamings of the spear of Duawg.</P>
<P>LXVII. I have repented of the time that I entreated<BR>
That thou shouldst not have thy choice;<BR>
It would have been generous to have life prolonged a month.</P>
<P>LXVIII. I know the voice of distress:--<BR>
When he descended into the congress-house,<BR>
Chief of men, a goblet of wine he deserved.</P>
