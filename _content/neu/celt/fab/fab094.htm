<P>LET God be praised in the beginning and the end.<BR>
Who supplicates Him, He will neither despise nor refuse.<BR>
The only son of Mary, the great exemplar of kings,<BR>
Mary, the mother of Christ, the praise of women.<BR>
The sun will come from the East to the North.<BR>
Intercede, for thy great mercy's sake,<BR>
With thy Son, the glorious object of our love,<BR>
God above us, God before us, God possessing (all things).<BR>
May the Father of Heaven grant us a portion of mercy;<BR>
10 Puissant Sovereign, may there be peace between us without refusal;<BR>
May we reform and make satisfaction for our transgressions,<BR>
Before I go to the earth to my fresh grave,<BR>
In the dark without a candle to my tribunal,<BR>
To my narrow abode, to the limits assigned to me, to my repose;<BR>
After my horse, and indulgence in fresh mead,<BR>
And social feasting, and gallantry with women.<BR>
I will not sleep; I will meditate on my end.<BR>
We are in a state the wantonness of which is sad;<BR>
Like leaves from the top of trees it will vanish away.<BR>
20 Woe to the niggard that hoards up precious things;<BR>
And unless the Supreme Father will support him,<BR>
Though he is allowed to have his course in the present world, his end will be dangerous.<BR>
He knows not what it is to be brave, yet will he not tremble in his present state; <A NAME="page_509"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 509</FONT></A><BR>
He will not rise up in the morning, will utter no greeting, nor will he sit;<BR>
He will not sing joyfully nor ask for mercy.<BR>
Bitter will, in the end, be the retribution<BR>
Of haughtiness, arrogance, and restlessness.<BR>
He pampers his body for toads and snakes<BR>
And lions, and conceives iniquity.<BR>
30 And death will come upon hoary age;<BR>
He is insatiable in the assembly and in the banquet.<BR>
Old age will draw nigh, and spreads itself over thee.<BR>
Thy ear, thy sight, thy teeth, they will not return;<BR>
The skin of thy fingers will wrinkle,<BR>
And age and hoariness will affect thee.<BR>
May Michael make intercession for us, that the Father of heaven may dispense us His mercy!<BR>
The beginning of summer is a most pleasant season, tuneful the birds, green the stalks of plants,<BR>
Ploughs are in the furrow, oxen in the yoke,<BR>
Green is the sea, variegated the land.<BR>
40 When cuckoos sing on the branches of pleasant trees,<BR>
May my joyfulness become greater.<BR>
Smoke is painful, sleeplessness is manifest.<BR>
Since my friends are returned to their former state<BR>
In the hill, in the dale, in the islands of the sea,<BR>
In every direction that one goes, in the presence of the blessed Christ there is no terror.<BR>
It was our desire, our friend, our trespass<BR>
To penetrate into the land of thy banishment.<BR>
Seven saints and seven score and seven hundred did he pierce in one convention.<BR>
With Christ the blessed they sustain. no apprehension of evil.<BR>
50 A gift I will ask, may it not be refused me by the God of peace. <A NAME="page_510"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 510</FONT></A><BR>
Since there is a way to the gate of the Supreme Father,<BR>
Christ, may I not be sad before thy throne!</P>
