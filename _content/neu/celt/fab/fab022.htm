<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>THE declaration of a clear song,<BR>
Of unbounded Awen,<BR>
About a warrior of two authors,<BR>
Of the race of the steel Ala.<BR>
With his staff and his wisdom,<BR>
And his swift irruptions,<BR>
And his sovereign prince,<BR>
And his scriptural number,<BR>
And his red purple,<BR>
10 And his assault over the wall,<BR>
And his appropriate chair,<BR>
Amongst the retinue of the wall.<BR>
Did not (he) lead from Cawrnur<BR>
Horses pale supporting burdens?<BR>
The sovereign elder.<BR>
The generous feeder.<BR>
The third deep wise one,<BR>
To bless Arthur,<BR>
Arthur the blessed,<BR>
20 In a compact song.<BR>
On the face in battle,<BR>
Upon him, a restless activity.<BR>
Who are the three chief ministers<BR>
That guarded the country? <A NAME="page_260"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 260</FONT></A><BR>
Who are the three skilful (ones)<BR>
That kept the token?<BR>
That will come with eagerness<BR>
To meet their lord?<BR>
High (is) the virtue of the course,<BR>
30 High will be the gaiety of the old,<BR>
High (is) the horn of travelling,<BR>
High the kine in the evening.<BR>
High (is) truth when it shines,<BR>
Higher when it speaks.<BR>
High when came from the cauldron<BR>
The three awens of Gogyrwen.<BR>
I have been Mynawg, wearing a collar,<BR>
With a horn in my hand.<BR>
He deserves not the chair<BR>
40 That keeps not my word.<BR>
With me is the splendid chair,<BR>
The inspiration of fluent (and) urgent song.<BR>
What the name of the three Caers,<BR>
Between the flood and the ebb?<BR>
No one knows who is not pressing<BR>
The offspring of their president.<BR>
Four Caers there are,<BR>
In Prydain, stationary,<BR>
Chiefs tumultuous.<BR>
50 As for what may not be, it will not be.<BR>
It will not be, because it may not be.<BR>
Let him be a conductor of fleets.<BR>
Let the billow cover over the shingle,<BR>
That the land becomes ocean,<BR>
So that it leaves not the cliffs,<BR>
Nor hill nor dale,<BR>
Nor the least of shelter,<BR>
Against the wind when it shall rage. <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A><BR>
The chair of the sovereign<BR>
60 He that keeps it is skilful.<BR>
Let them be sought there!<BR>
Let the munificent be sought.<BR>
Warriors lost,<BR>
I think in a wrathful manner.<BR>
From the destruction of chiefs,<BR>
In a butchering manner,<BR>
From the loricated Legion,<BR>
Arose the Guledig,<BR>
Around the old renowned boundary.<BR>
70 The sprouting sprigs are broken,<BR>
Fragile in like manner.<BR>
Fickle and dissolving.<BR>
Around the violent borders.<BR>
Are the flowing languages.<BR>
The briskly-moving stream<BR>
Of roving sea-adventurers,<BR>
Of the children of Saraphin.<BR>
A task deep (and) pure<BR>
To liberate Elphin.</P>
