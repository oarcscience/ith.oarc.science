<P>THE Hebrews took upon the sons of Israel,<BR>
High in mind,<BR>
A joint number in succession.<BR>
They approached.<BR>
God kept vengeance<BR>
On the people of Pharaonus.<BR>
Ten plagues paining<BR>
Before their being drowned<BR>
In the bottomless sea.<BR>
10 The first plague, fish destroying<BR>
With unusual cold.<BR>
The second plague, frogs abundant,<BR>
They filled the rivers,<BR>
The houses and furniture,<BR>
And couches,<BR>
And closets of meat.<BR>
The third, gnats,<BR>
Bold and sharp, were arranged.<BR>
The fourth, a: sharp watery humour<BR>
90 Strikes in the manner of winged insects.<BR>
Next were devoured<BR>
The fruits of the trees and the field<BR>
By a crop of flies. <A NAME="page_560"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 560</FONT></A><BR>
The fifth, murrain.<BR>
On all the children<BR>
Of the Egyptians,<BR>
Animals were destroyed.<BR>
With a heavy disease<BR>
They were all smitten.<BR>
30 The sixth, without deceit,<BR>
Sweating imposthumes,<BR>
The scars of ants.<BR>
The seventh, thunder,<BR>
Hail and fire,<BR>
And rain destructive.<BR>
Wind blasting the tops,<BR>
On leaves and shrubs.<BR>
The eighth, locusts,<BR>
Broad their ears,<BR>
40 Devouring flowers.<BR>
The ninth, prodigious<BR>
To be spoken of, terrible,<BR>
Like waves floating<BR>
Black darkness.<BR>
With a countenance gloomy.<BR>
Tenth, in the night<BR>
The greatest affliction<BR>
On the People of the tribes,<BR>
Christ Jesus, Christians, are prostrate<BR>
50 Until they are in shelter.<BR>
The six hundred warriors<BR>
Of the Hebrew soldiers.</P>
