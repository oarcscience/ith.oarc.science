### LXXVIII.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN VII.

LET us not reproach one another, but rather mutually save ourselves.  
Certain is a meeting after separation,  
The appointment of a senate, and a certain conference,  
And the rising from the grave after a long repose. <span
id="page_507">p. 507</span>  
The mighty God will keep in his power the man of correct life,  
And will let fire upon the unholy people,  
And lightning and thunder and wide-spread death.  
Neither a solitary nor a sluggard shall pass to a place of safety.  
And after peace there shall be the usages of a kingdom;  
10 The three hosts shall be brought to the overpowering presence of
Jesus:  
A pure and blessed host like the angels;  
Another host, mixed, like the people of a country;  
The third host, unbaptized, a multitude that directly after death  
Will proceed in a thick crowd to the side of devils,  
Not one of them shall go, owing to their hideous forms,  
To the place where there are flowers and dew on the pleasant land,  
Where there are singers tuning their harmonious lays,  
Happy will be their cogitations with the ruler of the glorious
retinue;  
Where the Apostles are in the kingdom of the humble,  
20 Where the bounteous Creator is on his glorious throne.  
May a disposition for the grave be given us; exalted is a relationship
to Him;  
And. before we are gathered together to mount Olivet,  
May those who have fallen be victorious over death;  
And work like theirs may we also do; for at the judgment day  
The wonders, greatness, and puissance of the Creator none can relate.
