DUNCAN MACLELLAN, crofter, Carnan, South Uist, heard this poem from
Catherine Macaulay in the early years of this century. When the crofters
along the east side of South Uist were removed, many of the more frail
and aged left behind became houseless and homeless, moving among and
existing upon the crofters left remaining along the west side of the
island.

Among these was Catherine Macaulay. Her people went to Cape Breton. She
came from Mol-a-deas, adjoining Corradale, where Prince Charlie lived
for several weeks when hiding in South Uist after Culloden. Catherine
Macaulay had seen the Prince several times, and had many reminiscences
of him and of his movements among the people of the district, who
entertained him to their best when much in need, and who shielded him to
their utmost when sorely harassed.

Catherine Macaulay was greatly gifted in speaking, and was marvellously
endowed with a memory for old tales and hymns, runes and incantations,
and for unwritten literature and traditions of many kinds.

She wandered about from house to house, and from townland to townland,
warmly welcomed and cordially received wherever she went, and remained
in each place longer or shorter according to the population and the
season, and <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> as the people could spare the
time to hear her. The description which Duncan Maclellan gave of
Catherine Macaulay, and of the people who crowded his father's house to
hear her night after night, and week after week, and of the discussions
that followed her recitations, were realistic and instructive. Being
then but a child he could not follow the meaning of this lore, but he
thought many times since that much of it must have been about the wild
beliefs and practices of his people of the long long ago, and perhaps
not so long ago either. Many of the poems and stories were long and
weird, and he could only remember fragments, which came up to him as he
lay awake, thinking of the present and the past. and of the contrast
between the two, even in his own time.

I heard versions of this poem in other islands and in districts of the
mainland, and in November 1888 John Gregorson Campbell, minister of
Tiree, sent me a fragment taken down from Margaret Macdonald, Tiree. The
poem must therefore have been widely known. in Tiree the poem was
addressed to boys and girls, in Uist to young men and maidens. Probably
it was composed to a maiden on her marriage. The phrase 'cala dhonn,'
brown swan, would indicate that the girl was young--not yet a white
swan.
