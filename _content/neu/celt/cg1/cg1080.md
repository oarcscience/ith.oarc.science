### LAOIDH AN TRIALL \[75\]

ON the first day of May the people of the crofter townland are up
betimes and busy as bees about to swarm. This is the day of migrating,
'bho baffle gu beinn,' from townland to moorland, from the winter
homestead to the summer sheiling. The summer of their joy is come, the
summer of the sheiling, the song, the pipe, and the dance, when the
people ascend the hill to the clustered bothies, overlooking the distant
sea from among the fronded ferns and fragrant heather, where neighbour
meets neighbour, and lover meets lover. All the families of the townland
bring their different flocks together at a particular place and drive
the whole away. This miscellaneous herd is called 'triall,' procession,
and is composed of horses, cattle, sheep. and goats. In the triall' the
sheep lead; the cattle follow according to their ages; then come the
goats, and finally the horses, with creels slung across their backs
laden with domestic gear of various kinds. The men carry burdens of
spades, sticks, pins, ropes, and other things that may be needed to
repair their summer huts, while the women carry bedding, meal, and dairy
utensils. About their waists the women wear a cord of wool, or a belt of
leather called 'crios-feile,' kilt girdle, underneath which their skirts
are drawn up and fastened, to enable them to 'walk the moor with greater
ease. These crofter women appear like Leezie Lindsay in the old song--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'She kilted her coats of green satin,  
And she kilted them up to the knee.'

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When the people
meet, they greet each other with great cordiality, as if they had not
seen one another for months or even years, instead of probably only a
few days before. There are endless noises in the herd: sheep bleat for
their lambs, lambs for their mothers, cows low for their calves, and the
calves respond, mares neigh for their foals, and foals whinny in reply
to their dams as they lightly skip and scamper, curveting in and out,
little dreaming of coming work and hard fare. The men give directions,
several at a time; the women knit their stockings and sing their songs,
walking free and erect as if there were no burdens on their backs or on
their hearts, nor any sin or sorrow in the world so far as they are
concerned. Ranged along on either side of the procession are barefooted,
bareheaded comely girls and sturdy boys, and sagacious dogs who every
now and then, and every here and there, have a neck-and-neck race with
some perverse young beast, unwillingly driven from his home, for, unlike
his elders, the animal does not know or does not remember the pleasures
of the heathery knoll, the grassy dell or fronded glen, and the joyous
freedom of the summer sheiling. All who meet them on the way bless the
'triall,' and invoke upon it a good day, much luck and prosperity, and
the safe shepherding of the Son of Mary on man and beast.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When the grazing
ground is reached, the loads are laid down, the huts repaired, fires
kindled and food made ready. The people bring forward their stock, each
man his own, and count them into the fold. The herdsman of the townland
and one or two more men stand within the gateway and count the flocks as
they enter. Each crofter is restricted in his stock on the common
grazing of the townland. He may, however, vary the number and the ages
of the species and thus equalise a deficit in one species by an excess
in another. Should a man have a 'barr-suma,' oversoum, he may arrange
with a man who has a 'di-suma,' undersoum, or with the townland at
large, for his extra stock. Every facility is given to a man in straits,
the consideration of these intelligent crofting people towards one
another being most pleasing. The grazing arrangements of the people,
complex to a stranger, but simple to themselves, show an intimate
knowledge of animal and pastoral life. Having seen to their flocks and
to the repairing of their huts, the people resort to their sheiling
feast. This feast consists principally of a male lamb, without spot or
blemish, killed that day. Formerly this Iamb was sacrificed, now it is
eaten. The feast is shared with friends and neighbours; all wish each
other luck and prosperity, with increase in their flocks:

<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>

<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>Beside each knoll<br />
The progeny of the sheiling cows.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The frugal feast
being finished and the remains divided among the dogs, who are not the
least interested or interesting actors in the day's proceedings, every
head is uncovered and every knee is bent as they invoke on man and beast
the 'shepherding of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.'

Protestantism prevails in Lewis, Harris, and North Uist, and the people
confine their invocations to the Trinity:--

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>'Feuch air fear coimhead Israil<br />
Codal chan aom no suain.'</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>The Shepherd that keeps Israel<br />
He slumbers not nor sleeps.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Roman Catholicism
prevails in Benbecula, South Uist, and Barra, and in their dedicatory
hymn the people of these islands invoke, besides the Trinity, St Michael
of the three-cornered shield and flaming sword, patron of their horses;
St Columba of the holy deeds, guardian of their cattle; Bride of the
clustering hair, the foster-mother of Christ; and the golden-haired
Virgin, mother of the White Lamb.

As the people intone their prayers on the lonely hill-side, literally in
the wilderness, the music of their evensong floats over glen and dell,
loch and stream, and is echoed from corrie and cliff till it is lost on
the soft evening air.
