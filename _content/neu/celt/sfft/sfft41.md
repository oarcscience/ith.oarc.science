### THE TWO YOUNG PLOUGHMEN. <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61)

"You have been often at the Gatehouse," said Johnny Nicholson; "well,
you'll mind a flat piece of land near Enrick farm; well, that was once a
large loch; a long way down from there is still the ruin of a mill,
which at that time was fed from this loch. Well, one night about the
Hallowe'en times, two young ploughmen went to a smiddy to get their
socks (of their ploughs) and colters repaired, and in passing the said
mill on their way home again they heard music and dancing, and fiddling,
and singing, and laughing, and talking; so one of the lads would be in
to see what was going on; the other waited outside for hours, but his
companion never came out again, so he went home, assured that the
brownies had got hold of him. About the same time the following year,
the same lad went again to the smiddy on the same errand, and this time
he took another lad with him, but had the precaution to put the Bible in
his pocket. Well, in passing the mill the second time, he heard the same
sounds of music and dancing. This time, having the Bible in his hand, he
ventured to look in, when who should he see but his companion whom he
had left standing there that day twelvemonths. He handed him the Bible,
and the moment he did so the music and dancing ceased, the lights went
out, and all was darkness."
