### THE FAIRY AND THE BIBLE-READER. <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66)

ON a still Sabbath evening in summer, an old man was seated, reading his
Bible in the open air, at a quiet spot upon the Ross-shire coast. A
beautiful little lady, clad in green, drew near, and addressing him in a
silvery voice, sought to know if for such as she Holy Scripture held out
any hope of salvation. The old man spoke kindly to her; but said that in
those pages there was no mention of salvation for any but the sinful
sons of Adam. On hearing this, the fairy flung her arms despairingly
above her head, and with a shriek plunged into the sea.
