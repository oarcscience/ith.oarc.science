<p>ONE day the fox succeeded in catching a fine fat goose asleep by the side of a loch; he held her by the wing, and making a joke of her cackling, hissing, and fears, he said--</p>  
<p>"Now, if you had me in your mouth as I have you, tell me what you would do?"</p>  
<p>"Why," said the goose, "that is an easy question. I would fold my hands, shut my eyes, say a grace, and then eat you."</p>  
<p>"Just what I mean to do," said Rory;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and folding his hands, and looking very demure, he said a pious grace with his eyes shut.</p>  
<p>But while he did this the goose had spread her wings, and she was now half way over the loch; so the fox was left to lick his lips for supper.</p>  
<p>"I will make a rule of this," he said in disgust, never in all my life to say a grace again till after I feel the meat warm in my belly."</p>
