### FROG AND CROW.

HERE is a bit of crow language,--a conversation with a frog. When it is
repeated in Gaelic it can be made absurdly like the notes of the
creatures.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

"Ghille Criosda mhic Dhughail cuir a nois do mhàg."

Christ's servant, son of Dugald, put up thy paw.

"Tha eagal orm, tha eagal orm, tha eagal orm."

I fear.

"Gheibh thu còta gorm a's léine. Gheibh thu còta gorm a's léine."

Thou shalt have a blue coat and a shirt.

Then the frog put up his hand and the hoodie took him to a hillock and
began to eat him, saying,

"Biadh dona lom! 's bu dona riabh thu."

Bad bare meat and bad wert thou ever.

"Caite bheil do ghealladh math a nis?" said the frog.

Where is thy good promise now?

"Sann ag ol a bha sinn an latha sin. Sann ag ol a bha sinn an latha
sin."

It is drinking we were on that day.

"Toll ort a ruid ghrannda gur beag feola tha air do chramhan."

"Toll ort!" said the hoodie.

A hole in thee, ugly thing! how little flesh is on thy bones.
