### THE GLOAMING BUCHT. <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68)

"SPEAKIN' o' fairies," quoth Robbie Oliver (an old shepherd, who lived
at Southdean in Jedwater, and died about 1830), "I can tell ye about the
vera last fairy that was seen hereaway. When my faither, Peter Oliver,
was a young man, he lived at Hyndlee, an' herdit the Brocklaw. Weel, it
was the custom to milk the yowes in thae days, an' my faither was
buchtin' <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69) the Brocklaw yowes to twae
young, lish, clever hizzies ne nicht i' the gloamin'. Nae little daffin'

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

an' gabbin' <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70) gaed on amang the
threesome, I'se warrant ye, till at last, just as it chanced to get
darkish, my faither chancit to luik alang the lea at the head o' the
bucht, an' what did he see but a wee little creaturie a' clad i' green,
an' wi' lang hair, yellow as gowd, hingin' round its shoulders, comin'
straight for him, whiles gi'en a whink o' a greet <span
id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71) an' aye atween its hands raisin' a queer,
unyirthly cry, 'Hae ye seen Hewie Milburn? Oh! hae ye seen Hewie
Milburn?' Instead of answering the creature, my faither sprang owre the
bucht flake, <span id="fr_72"></span>[3](#fn_72) to be near the lasses,
saying, 'Bliss us a'--what's that?' 'Ha, ha! Patie lad,' quo' Bessie
Elliot, a free-spoken Liddesdale hempy; 'theer a wife com'd for ye the
nicht, Patie lad.' 'A wife!' said my faither; 'may the Lord keep me frae
sic a wife as that,' an' he confessed till his deein' day, he was in sic
a fear that the hairs o' his heed stuid up like the hirses of a
hurcheon. <span id="fr_73"></span>[4](#fn_73) The creature was nae
bigger than a three-year-auld lassie, but feat an' tight, lith o' limb,
as ony grown woman, an' its face was the downright perfection o' beauty,
only there was something wild an' unyirthly in its e'en that couldna be
lookit at, faur less describit: it didna molest them, but aye
taigilt <span id="fr_74"></span>[5](#fn_74) on about the bucht, now an'
then repeatin' its cry, 'Hae ye seen Hewie Milburn?' Sae they cam' to
nae ither conclusion than that it had tint <span
id="fr_75"></span>[6](#fn_75) its companion. When my faither an' the
lasses left the

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

bucht, it followed them hame to the Hyndlee kitchen, where they offered
it yowe brose, but it wad na tak' onything, till at last a neer-do-weel
callant made as if he wad grip it wi' a pair o' reed-het tangs, an' it
appeared to be offendit, an' gaed awa' doon the burnside, cryin' its
auld cry eerier an' waesomer than ever, and disappeared in a bush o'
seggs." <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76)
