<p>"Noo, lasses, ye should never be owre proud; for ye see there was ance a leddy, and she was aye fond o' being brawer than other folk; so she gaed awa' to take a walk ae day, her and her brother: so she met wi' a gentleman--but it was nae gentleman in reality, but Auld Nick himsel', who can change himsel' brawly into a gentleman--a' but the cloven feet; but he keepit them out o' sight. So he began to make love to the young leddy:--</p>
