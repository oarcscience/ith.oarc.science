### THE FOX OUTWITTED.

ONE day the fox succeeded in catching a fine fat goose asleep by the
side of a loch; he held her by the wing, and making a joke of her
cackling, hissing, and fears, he said--

"Now, if you had me in your mouth as I have you, tell me what you would
do?"

"Why," said the goose, "that is an easy question. I would fold my hands,
shut my eyes, say a grace, and then eat you."

"Just what I mean to do," said Rory; <span id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_39)
and folding his hands, and looking very demure, he said a pious grace
with his eyes shut.

But while he did this the goose had spread her wings, and she was now
half way over the loch; so the fox was left to lick his lips for supper.

"I will make a rule of this," he said in disgust, never in all my life
to say a grace again till after I feel the meat warm in my belly."

fox "Ruadh."
