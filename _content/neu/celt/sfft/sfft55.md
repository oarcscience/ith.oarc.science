### GRAHAM OF MORPHIE. <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83)

THE old family of the Grahams of Morphie was in former times very
powerful, but at length they sunk in fortune, and finally the original
male line became extinct. Among the old women of the Mearns, their decay
is attributed to a supernatural cause. When one of the lairds, say they,
built the old castle he secured the assistance of the water-kelpy or
river-horse, by the accredited means of throwing a pair of branks <span
id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84) over his head. He then compelled the
robust spirit to carry prodigious loads of stones for the building, and
did not relieve him till the whole was finished. The poor kelpy was glad
of his deliverance, but at the same time felt himself so galled with the
hard labour, that on being permitted to escape from the branks, and just
before he disappeared in the water, he turned about, and expressed, in
the following words, at once his own grievances and the destiny of his
taskmaster's family--

"Sair back and sair banes,  
Drivin' the laird o' Morphie's stanes!  
The laird o', Morphie'll never thrive  
As lang's the kelpy is alive!"
