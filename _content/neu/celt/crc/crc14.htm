<p>It is then that Medb went with a third of the host with her to Cuib to seek the Bull; and Cuchulainn went after her. Now on the road of Midluachair she had gone to harry Ulster and Cruthne as far as Dun Sobairche. Cuchulainn saw something: Bude Mac Bain from Sliab Culinn with the Bull, and fifteen heifers round him; and his force was sixty men of Ailill's household, with a cloak folded round every man. Cuchulainn comes to them.</p>  
<p>'Whence have you brought the cattle?' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
<p>'From the mountain yonder,' said the man'</p>  
<p>'Where are their cow-herds?' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
<p>'He is as we found him,' said the man.</p>  
<p>Cuchulainn made three leaps after them to seek speech with them as far as the ford. It is there he said to the leader:</p>  
<p>'What is your name?' said he.</p>  
<p>'One who fears you not (?) and loves you not; Bude Mac Bain,' said he.</p>  
<p>'This spear at Bude!' said Cuchulainn. He hurls at him the javelin, so that it went through his armpits, and one of the livers broke in two before the spear.</p>
