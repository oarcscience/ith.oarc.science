<p>They are there till next morning; then Fraech is summoned to them. 'Help us, O Fraech,' said Medb. 'Remove from us the strait that is on us. Go before Cuchulainn for us, if perchance you shall fight with him.'</p>  
<p>He set out early in the morning with nine men, till he reached Ath Fuait. He saw the warrior bathing in the river.</p>  
<p>'Wait here,' said Fraech to his retinue, 'till I come to the man yonder; not good is the water,' said he.</p>  
<p>He took off his clothes, and goes into the water to him.</p>  
<p>'Do not come to me,' said Cuchulainn. 'You will die from it, and I should be sorry to kill you.'</p>  
<p>'I shall come indeed,' said Fraech, 'that we may meet in the water; and let your play with me be fair.'</p>  
<p>'Settle it as you like,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
<p>'The hand of each of us round the other,' said Fraech.</p>  
<p>They set to wrestling for a long time on the water, and Fraech was submerged. Cuchulainn lifted him up again.</p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>  
<p>'This time,' said Cuchulainn, 'will you yield and accept your life?'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'I will not suffer it,' said Fraech.</p>  
<p>Cuchulainn put hiss under it again, until Fraech was killed. He comes to land; his retinue carry his body to the camp. Ath Fraich, that was the name of that ford for ever. All the host lamented Fraech. They saw a troop of women in green tunics&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on the body of Fraech Mac Idaid; they drew him from them into the mound. Sid Fraich was the name of that mound afterwards.</p>  
<p>Fergus springs over the oak in his chariot. They go till they reach Ath Taiten; Cuchulainn destroys six of them there: that is, the six Dungals of Irress.</p>  
<p>Then they go on to Fornocht. Medb had a whelp named Baiscne. Cuchulainn throws a cast at him, and took his head off. Druim was the name of that place henceforth.</p>  
<p>'Great is the mockery to you,' said Medb, 'not to hunt the deer of misfortune yonder that is killing you.'</p>  
<p>Then they start hunting him, till they broke the shafts of their chariots thereat.</p>
