<p>They take away the Bull then in that morning of the battle, so that he met the White-horned at Tarbga in Mag Ai; <i>i.e.</i> Tarbguba or Tarbgleo.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The first name of that hill was Roi Dedond. Every one who escaped in the fight was intent on nothing but beholding the two Bulls fighting.</p>  
<p>Bricriu Poison-tongue was in the west in his sadness after Fergus had broken his head with his draughtmen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> He came with the rest then to see the combat of the Bulls. The two Bulls went in fighting</p>

<p>over Bricriu, so that he died therefrom. That is the Death of Bricriu.</p>  
<p>The foot of the Dun of Cualnge lighted on the horn of the other. For a day and a night he did not draw his foot towards him, till Fergus incited him and plied a rod along his body.</p>  
<p>'&#8217;Twere no good luck,' said Fergus, 'that this <A HREF="errata.htm#0">combative</A> old calf which has been brought here should leave the honour of clan and race; and on both sides men have been left dead through you.' Therewith he drew his foot to him so that his leg (?) was broken, and the horn sprang from the other and was in the mountain by him. It was Sliab n-Adarca&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> afterwards.</p>  
<p>He carried them then a journey of a day and a night, till he lighted in the loch which is by Cruachan, and he came to Cruachan out of it with the loin and the shoulder-blade and the liver of the other on his horns. Then the hosts came to kill him. Fergus did not allow it, but that he should go where he pleased. He came then to his land and drank a draught in Findlethe on coming. It is there that he left the shoulder-blade of the other. Findlethe afterwards was the name of the land. He drank another draught in Ath Luain; he left the loin of the other there: hence is Ath Luain. He gave forth his roar on Iraird Chuillend; it was heard through all the province. He drank a draught in Tromma. There the liver of the other fell from his horns; hence is Tromma. He came to Etan Tairb.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> He put his forehead against the hill at Ath Da Ferta; hence is Etan Tairb in Mag Murthemne. Then he went on the road of Midluachair</p>

<p>in Cuib. There he used to be with the milkless cow of Dairi, and he made a trench there. Hence is Gort Buraig.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="crc39.htm#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Then he went till he died between Ulster and Iveagh at Druim Tairb. Druim Tairb is the name of that place.</p>
