### The Death of the Meic Garach

Then the Meic Garach waited on their ford. These are their names: Lon
and Ualu and Diliu; and Mes-Ler, and Mes-Laech, and Mes-Lethan were
their three charioteers. They thought it too much what Cuchulainn had
done: to slay two foster-sons of the king, and his son, and to shake the
head before the host. They would slay Cuchulainn in return for him, and
would themselves remove this annoyance from the host. They cut three
aspen wands for their charioteers, that the six of them should pursue
combat against him. He killed them all then, because they had broken
fair-play towards him.

Orlam's charioteer was then between Ailill and Medb. Cuchulainn hurled a
stone at him, <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38) so that his head
broke, and his brains came over his ears; Fertedil was his name. (Thus
it is not true that Cuchulainn did not kill charioteers; howbeit, he did
not kill them without fault.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_38"></span>[38:1](crc07.htm#fr_38) Apparently because the
charioteer had not carried Orlam's head into the camp on his back. Or an
alternative version.
