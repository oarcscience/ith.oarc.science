<p>Then the boys of Ulster had consulted in Emain Macha.</p>  
<p>'Wretched indeed,' said they, 'for our friend Cuchulainn to be without help.'</p>  
<p>'A question indeed,' said Fiachna Fulech Mac Fir-Febe, own brother to Fiacha Fialdama Mac Fir-Febe, 'shall I have a troop among you, and go to take help to him therefrom?'</p>  
<p>Three fifties of boys go with their playing-clubs, and that was a third of the boys of Ulster. The host saw them coming towards them across the plain.</p>  
<p>'A great host is at hand to us over the plain,' said Ailill.</p>  
<p>Fergus goes to look at them. 'Some of the boys of Ulster that,' said he; 'and they come to Cuchulainn's help.'</p>  
<p>'Let a troop go against them,' said Ailill, 'without Cuchulainn's knowledge; for if they meet him, you will not withstand them.'</p>  
<p>Three fifties of warriors go to meet them. They</p>  
<p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></A></p>  
<p>fell by one another so that no one escaped alive of the abundance (?) of the boys at Lia Toll. Hence it is the Stone of Fiachra Mac Fir-Febe; for it is there he fell.</p>  
<p>'Make a plan,' said Ailill.</p>  
<p>'Ask Cuchulainn about letting you go out of this place, for you will not come beyond him by force, because his flame of valour has sprung.'</p>  
<p>For it was customary with him, when his flame of valour sprang in him, that his feet would go round behind him, and his hams before; and the balls of his calves on his shins, and one eye in his head and the other out of his head; a man's head could have gone into his mouth. Every hair on him was as sharp as a thorn of hawthorn, and a drop of blood on each hair. He would not recognise comrades or friends. He would strike alike before and behind. It is from this that the men of Connaught gave Cuchulainn the name Riastartha.</p>
