<p>When the hosts were there in the evening, they saw that one stone lighted on them from the east, and another from the west to meet it. They met in the air, and kept falling between Fergus's camp, and Ailill's, and Era's.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> This sport and play went on from that hour to the same hour next day; and the hosts were sitting down, and their shields were over their heads to protect them against the masses of stones, till the plain was full of the stones. Hence is Mag Clochair. It happened that Curoi Mac Daire did this; he had come to help his comrades, and he was in Cotal over against Munremar Mac Gerrcind. He had come from Emain Macha to help Cuchulainn, and he was in Ard Roich. Curoi knew that there was no man in the host who could withstand Munremar. So it was these two who had made this sport between them. They were asked by the host to be quiet; then Munremar and Curoi make peace, and Curoi goes to his house and Munremar</p>

<p>to Emain Macha. And Munremar did not come till the day of the battle; Curoi did not come till the combat with Fer Diad.</p>  
<p>'Speak to Cuchulainn,' said Medb and Ailill, that he allow us change of place.'</p>  
<p>It is granted to them then, and they change the place. The weakness of the Ulstermen was over then. For when they awoke from their suffering, some of them kept coming on the host, that they might take to slaying them again.</p>
