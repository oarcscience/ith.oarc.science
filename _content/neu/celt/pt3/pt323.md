### LXXIII.

### THE YELLOW MUILEARTEACH.

1--BARD.

On a day when the Fhinn were on Oirill's mound,  
A watching the Eireann all around,  
There was seen coming on the tops of the wave,  
The crooked, clamouring, shivering brave.

2

The name of that undaunted wraith  
Was the bald russet-yellow Muilearteach  
From Lochlann's bounds, coming on brine,  
All in a day to cover Eirinn.

A MHUILEARTACH BHUIDHE. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18)

1

Latha dh' an Fhinn, air Tulach Oirill, <sup>1</sup>  
A' coimhead na h-Eireann mu timchill  
Chunnacas a' tighinn, air barraibh thonn,  
An eàrra, ghàireach, chraobhaidh, chrom.

2

2

’Se b' ainm dh' an fuath nach bu thim  
A' Mhuileartach mhaol, ruadh-bhuidhe,  
O chriochan Lochlann 'tighinn air sàil  
Gu h-Eirinn a chomhdach a dh' aon là.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

3

A rusted glaive was upon her belt,  
Will give them a grim darkling pelt;  
When the time of the fury of battle shall come.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

4

There were two slender spears of battle,  
Upon the other side of the carlin;  
Her face was blue-black of the lustre of coal,  
And her bone tufted tooth was like rusted bone.

5

In her head was one deep pool-like eye,  
Swifter than a star in a winter sky;  
Upon her head gnarled brushwood,  
Like the clawed old wood of the aspen root.

6

Her heart was merry for joy,  
As she saw in the south the Fiantaidh  
"Will ye not teach the wretch to her ruin,  
Let not her's be a good gift without return."

7

And a hundred warriors she sportively slew,  
And there was a grim on her rugged maw;  
A warrior exalted each warrior of these,  
And that were raised up on slender trees.

8

A pouring of their blood amongst the hounds,  
And the juice of the fruit of Oireal was threatened;  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

3

Bha claidheamh meirgeach air a crios  
Bheir dhaibh caisgeadh dùige, doite <sup>3</sup>  
An am an d' thigeadh gairbhe catha,

4

Bha da shleagha chaola chatha  
Air an taobh eile dh' an chaillich.  
Bha 'h-aodann dubh-ghorm air dreach a' ghuail,  
’S a deud cnábadach, cnàmh-ruadh.

4

5

Bha aon suil ghlumach <sup>5</sup> 'na ceann  
Bu luaithe na rionnag gheamhraidh  
<sup>6</sup> Craobh mhìneach chas air a ceann  
Mar <sup>7</sup> choill ìnich de 'n t-seana chrithinn.

6

Bha 'cridhe 'mire ri h-àdh,  
’Si 'g amhare nam Fianntaidh fo dheas,  
"Nach deachd <sup>8</sup> sibh a' bheist thun a h-aimhleis.  
’S gu 'n tharladh leatha gean gun chomain;"

7

’S gu 'n mharbh i le 'h-abhachd ceud laoch;  
’S gu 'n robh càir <sup>9</sup> air a garbh chraos.  
Laoch inbheach gach laoch a bh' ann,  
’S a thogadh air chaola chrann.

8

Air sgath fala, 'measg nan con,  
’S bha brigh mhios Oirill 'ga maoidheadh.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

9--WITCH.

Who are the warriors better than they?  
Out spoke the yellow Muilearteach;  
"Terror or fear there is not upon me,  
Before the king since I happened upon ye."

10--BARD.

To Fionn Prince of the Finne there came,  
The ill-favoured goblin right valiant;  
By her there were slaughtered nine in the plain,  
As she sought for detestable combat.

11--WITCH.

Now since I have come over the brine,  
For the taking of all Eirinn  
Let yielding be given me without pain,  
Or else a whole battle of hardy men."

12--BARD AND FIONN.

Mac Chumhail would give that without displeasure,  
Ten hundred hounds, upon leashes of leather;  
"Take the bribe, and besides (behold),  
Ten hundred ruddy apples of gold."

13--WITCH.

Although I should get all the value of Eirinn,  
With her gold and her silver and her precious things;  
I would rather have on board of my vessel,  
The heads of Osgar, and Raonaidh, and Coiril."

14-BARD AND CONAN.

Spoke a hero that brooked no slur,  
Son of great Morna, by name Conan;  
"Thou shalt loose the bush of thy round head,  
Because thou hast asked for the son of Oisein."

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

9

"Cia iad na laoich a 's fhearr na sin?"  
Labhair a' Mhuileartach bhuidhe.  
"Fiamh na eagal cha 'n 'eil orm  
Roimh 'n righ, o'n tharladh mi thugaibh." <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19)

10

Gu Fionn, flath na Finne, thainig  
Am fuath dìth-mhaiseach, <sup>10</sup> deagh-dhana.  
Mharbhadh leatha naonar 's a' mbagh,  
’S i 'g iarraidh fuath'chadh na comhraig.

11

"Nis o'n thainig mi air sàil  
Gu h-Eirinn uile do ghabhail,  
Thugta geill gun doruinn domh,  
Airneo comhrag cròdha churaidhean."

12

Bheireadh MacChumhail siud di gun diombadh,  
Deich ceud cu air choimh lion éille,  
"Gabh an cumha, is e 'choir,"  
"Deich ceud ubhlan dearg oir."

13

"Buaidh na h-Eirionn gad gheibhinn uile,  
Le 'h-or, 's le 'h-airgiod, 's le 'h-ionmhas,  
B' fhearr leam, air bord air mo luing,  
Ceann Osgair, a's Raonaidh, a's Choiril."

14

Labhair laoch nach d' fhulaing tair,  
Mac mor Morna d' am b' ainm Conan,  
"Caillidh tu dos do chinn chruinn  
Ann an dàil Mhic Oisein iarraidh."

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

15--BARD.

When they saw the wrath of the monster,  
Up rose Fionn the Prince of the Finne;  
Up rose Oisean, Prince of the men,  
Up rose Osgar, and Iollainn.

16

Up rose Diarmaid o' Duibhne;  
Up rose they, and Iall o' Buidhne;  
Three sons of the dusky black king Dhuinne;  
Up rose they, and Cearbhal.

17

Up rose Glaisean o' Damhach  
Up rose they, and Ard Ambarc  
Up rose Ciar Dhubh, Prince of Lomhann,  
The doughtiest four that were in the Fhinn.

18

Went to do battle with the beast.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

19

She was serving them out in turn,  
As a blade might run through flame;  
Until there met MacChumail the grand,  
And the Muilearteach hand to hand.

20

Their equal was never yet seen,  
Since the smithy of Lonn MacLiobhainn; <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20)  
There was dew on the point of the spears,  
Of MacChumhail of the sides so fair.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

15

Nuair chunnaic iad colg na beiste;  
Gu 'n d' eirich Fionn, flath na Finne;  
Dh' eirich Oisean, flath nam fear;  
Gu 'n d' eirich Osgar a's Iollainn.

16

Gu 'n d' eirich Diarmaid O Duibhne;  
Gu 'n d' eirich sin a's Iall O Buidhne;  
Triuir mac an righ chiar-dhubh Dhùinne;  
Gu 'n d' eirich sin agus Cearbhall.

17

Dh' eirich Glaisean O Damhach;  
Dh' eirich sin agus Ard-amhare;  
Dh' eirich Ciar-dhubh, mac righ Lomhann,  
A cheathrar a b' fhoghaintiche 'bha 'san Fhìnn.

18

Chaidh a chomhrhg ris a' bheist.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

19

Bha i 'gam frithealadh mu seach  
Mar a ruitheadh lann roimh lasair,  
Gus an do thachair Mac Chumhail an aidh  
'S a' Mhuileartach lamh ri lamh.

20

An aicheadh cha 'n fhacas mar sin  
O cheardach Lonn Mhic an Liobhann,  
Bha dealt air bharraibh a shleagh  
Aig Mac Chumhail an taoibh ghil.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

21

Her side was pierced with sharp wound,  
There was rain of her blood on the heather  
The Muilearteach was slain by the king,  
And if she was slain, it was no smooth slaying.

22--SMITH.

The smith took with him her bree <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21)  
To Tur Leoin of the high king.  
"My sorrow!" said the smith of the axes,  
"If bald russet Muilearteach is slain."

23--KING.

The king said, "the people never stood,  
That on the bald russet could bring blood;  
Unless in a land of holes fell she,  
Or was drowned upon the smooth bare sea."

24

"There never yet have come of any,  
Those who the yellow Muilearteach could slay;  
They did not slay her, but the Fhinn,  
A band from whom tribute is not won."

25

"Great is the shame to the blossom of Phail,  
To give under to the people of a single isle  
To the travelling, and to the west,  
Travel we, and travel we in haste."

26

"That I would give my vow again,  
If my mild Muilearteach has been slain;  
That I with my people should never return,  
Till Eirinn to a heap of ashes should burn.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

21

Bha 'taobh air a tholladh le guin  
Bha braon dh' a fuil air na fraochaibh.  
Mharbhadh a' Mhuileartach leis an righ  
Ma mharbhadh cha b' e 'm marbhadh min.

22

Thug an gobha leis a' brigh  
Gu tùr Leoin, an t-ard righ.  
"Mo bheud," arsa gobha nan tuadh,  
"Ma mharbhadh a' Mhuileartach mhaol ruadh."

23

Thuirt an righ, "nach d' f has a shluagh  
Na 'bheireadh fuil air a' mhaoil ruaidh.  
Mar an deach i 'n talamh toll,  
Na 'bathadh air muir sleamhuinn, lom."

24

Cha d' thainig de dhaoine 'sam bith  
Na 'mharbhadh a' Mhuileartach bhuidhe.  
Cha do mharbh i ach an Fhinn,  
Buidheann bhar nach buinigear cis."

25

"’S mor an nair do Bhlaith Phàil  
Géill a thoirt do luchd aon eilean.  
Air an triallam, 's air an iar;  
Triallam, agus triallam mor."

26

"Gu 'n d' thugainn-sa mo bhòid a ris,  
Ma Mharbhadh mo Mhuileartach mhìn,  
A choidhch nach tillinn le m' shluagh  
Gus am biodh Eirinn 'na torr luatha.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

27

"In Eirinn let me not leave a stone,  
In burn, or in moor, or in- mountain lone;  
Unlifted upon the beaks of my fleet,  
Eirinn level of such great weight."

28

I will bring my plungers upon the brine  
To bring out of her sea bent all Eirinn."  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

29--BARD.

Great is the brag for the white ships  
The whole of Eirinn to uplift,  
And that there are not white ships in being  
That could uplift one fifth of Eirinn.

30--KING.

"Gather to me my worthy race,  
King of the Spaniards and his force,  
The king of Greece and of Gallia clean,  
King of Hispania and of the Inds."

31--BARD.

Gather of the whole world the clan,  
The children of a king and of a single man,  
Goblin or champion shall not get clear  
From the beautiful Fhinn of the yellow hair.

32

Seven score ships, and one thousand  
Gathered the king, what a heavy band  
For the taking of all Eirinn,  
Could it be brought to Fionn, prince of the Finne.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

27

"An Eirinn na fagam clach,  
An allt, na 'm monadh, na 'm fireach,  
Gun thogail air chorraibh mo long;  
Eirinn chothromach, cho trom.

28

"Bheiream breabanaich air sàil  
Toirt Eirinn uil' as a tan."  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

29

’S mor an spleadh do luingeas bàn  
Eirinn uile do thogfail;  
’S gun de luingeas bàn sam bith  
Na thogadh, a dh' Eirinn, coigeamh.

30

RIGH.

"Tionail thugam mo theaghlach còir,  
Righ na h-Easpanaidh 's a shlogh,  
Righ Greige, 's righ Gallia glan,  
Righ na h-Easpainn a's na h-Inid."

31

FILIDH.

Tionail sluagh an t-saoghail uile,  
De chlann righ, 's de dh' aon duine;  
Fuath na eàrrachd cha d' thig as  
O'n Fhinn aluinn fhalt-bhuidhe."

32

Seachd fichead a's mile long  
Thionail an righ, 's gu 'm b' fheachd trom,  
Gu gabhail Eirinn air fad  
Gu Fionn, flath na Finna na 'n tárt 'e.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

33

There was not a port nor a half port within  
The five-fifths of the Eireann  
That of beaked barks was not full,  
And of the barges of their lords all.

34

Though it was evil to be waiting for them,  
'Twas no better for them that to us they came.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

35

A messenger came from Blaith Phail,  
To find for him the Muilearteach,  
Or else the bold youth of all Eirinn,  
The children of a single man or of a king.

That MacChumhail would give to the  
King of Lochlann, and without a grudge.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

36

Ten hundred helmets and fine mail,  
Ten hundred shields and sheathed glaives,  
Ten hundred collars of gold upon hounds,  
Ten hundred slender stingers of battle.

37

Ten hundred fine coloured flags,  
Ten hundred wise warriors whom he might choose  
Ten hundred bridles of gold and saddles.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

33

Cha robh port na leith-phort ann,  
An coig choigeamh na h-Eireann,  
Nach robh lan de bharcaibh bheannach,  
Agus bhirlinnibh o thighearnan.

34

Ge b' ole dhuinn a bhith air an cionn,  
Cha 'n ann daibh-san a b' fhearr teachd thugainn.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

35

Thainig teachdair o, Bhlaith Phàil  
A Mhuileartach fhaotainn da,  
Airneo borbraidh Eirinn uile  
Eadar clann righ 's aon duine.

Bheireadh MacChumhail siud do righ Lochlann  
’S gun diomadh;--  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

36

Deich ceud clogad a's caol luireach,  
Deich ceud sgiath a's claidheamh comhdaicht,  
Deich ceud lomhainn òir air chonaibh,  
Deich ceud sallta chaola chatha,

37

Deich ceud bratach mhìne, dhaite,  
Deich ceud saoidh, na 'm b' aille leis,  
Deich ceud strian òir agus diollaid.  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

38\.

Though he got all that, the king of Lochlann  
And the bold youth of the whole of Eirionn,  
For ever with his people he would not be still  
Till Eirinn should become a ruddy hill.

39--LOCHLANNERS.

Then spoke an answerable true wise bard,  
The lad that could answer with a knowing word;  
And he spoke timidly and like a sneer  
Unto the king that was too early.

40--BARD.

"Though you, like the whole of the Fhinn,  
In the front of battle and combat  
You must come as lions, weighty and gray,  
Or else you will work out your own decay.

41

"It were better to get us on a single place  
Than from billow to billow to be on our trace."  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

42--KING.

"Thy counsel is lying, thou musical bard,"  
Out spoke the king, wrathfully, hatingly,  
"Because a third part of what is there (seen)  
Thou hast never beheld in Eirinn."

43--FEENE.

 <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22) Then spoke Garaidh of the glens:
( [156-2](pt323.htm#xref_156-2))  
If you will take my counsel, Fhinn,  
Let submission be given on the sea,  
That for ever under his sway you may be."

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

38

Ged a gheibheadh righ Lochlann siud,  
Agus borbraidh na h- Eirionn uile,  
Choidhch' cha stadadh e le 'shluagh  
Gus am biodh Eirinn 'na torr ruadh.

39

Thuirt filidh fhreagarrach, fior-ghlic,  
An gille fhreagradh gu h-eolach--  
’S labhair e gu fromhaidh, fàdh,  
Ris an righ, gu 'n robh ro thrath.

40--FILIDH.

"Ge math leibhs' an Fhinn uile  
An tus cath agus comhraig;  
Thig sibh 'n 'ur Leomhana trom, ghlas,  
Airneo ni sibh uil' 'ur n-aimhleas.

41

B' fhearr 'ur faighinn air aona bhall,  
Na 'bhith 'g ur sireadh o thuinn gu tuinn."  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
    .       .       .       .       .       .

42--RIGH.

’S breugach do bheachd fhilidh bhinn,  
Thuirt an righ gu fuathach, feargach;  
"Agus trian na 'bheil an sin  
Nach fhaca tu riamh an Eirinn."

43

An sin labhair Garaidh nan Gleann,  
"Ma ghabhas sibh, comhairl, Fhinn,  
Rachadh geill a thoirt air sail,  
'S gu 'm biodh sibh gu bràth fo iona."

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

44--BARD.

Up rose Iollain with a hero's tread,  
And each one followed him side by side,  
To give a leathering to Garaidh from the wild,  
Who the service of man could not abide.

45--FIONN.

"Stay thou, Iollain, as thou mayest be,"  
Said MacChumhail, the prince so high,  
"Though evil the counsel of the man,  
Stalwart his hand when the strife began."

46--OSGAR.

Said Osgar, as he felt the pain,  
"Whatever ship is of loftiest sail,  
Shall swim in blood beneath her keel,  
If there be enough within her hull."

47--BARD.

Then raised they, and they were not scarce,  
Their slender pennons on their slender shafts  
The standard of MacChumhail of Victories,  
"Sun's brightness," above the trees.

48\.

There were nine chains from it downward fell  
Of the yellow gold, of no lustre dull,  
A hero at every chain of these,  
That was holding them against the stays.

49\.

In the camp there was many a thousand of men,  
Many a one with blades and spears so keen,  
Many a trunkless head was there,  
Many a neck there was swept bare.

From the first of the sun till the same evening.

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

44

Dh' eirich Iollainn, 's bu cheum laoich,  
’S gach ti lean e taobh ri taobh,  
Thoirt leadairt air Garaidh o 'n fhasach,  
’S cha b' aill leis duine 'ga fhasdadh.

45--FIONN.

"Stad ort Iollainn mar a ta thu;"  
Arsa Mac Chumhail an ard fhlatha,  
"Ge b' olc impidh an fhir,  
"Bu teom' a lamh anns an iorguill."

46--OSGAR.

Thuirt Osgar, 's e 'gabhail loon,  
"Ge b' e long a 's airde seol,  
Snamhaidh i 'm fuil fo' a driom,  
Ma tha na h-urad 'na colainn."

47--FILIDH.

Thog iad an siud, 's cha bu ghann,  
An caol shrolt, air an caol chroinn;--  
Bratach Mhic Chumhail an aidh,  
Gile-ghreine, as cionn chrannaibh.

48

Bha naoidh slabhraidhean aisde sios  
De 'n òr bhuidhe gun dall-sgiamh;  
Laoch air gach slabhraidh dhiu sin  
A bha 'gan cumail ris na slàithean.

49

Bu lionar 's a' chrò mìle fear;  
Bu lionar fear gheur lann 's sleagh ann;  
Bu lionar ceann ann gun chom iona;  
Bu lionar muineal ann air maoladh,

O thus greine gu con-fheasgar.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

50

Those heroes the greatest of the tribe  
That came to us with an army (of pride),  
To them the camp was the narrowest  
Ere their rough vapouring was dispersed.

51

In the thick of the people Osgar slew  
One hundred spearmen for the first time,  
Another hundred of the people by three,  
Seeking a way to their Ard Righ.

52

Another hundred of the hosts of men  
On the further side of the King of Lochlann,  
Until he slew, in the thick of the host,  
The king for all his great honour's boast.

53

When they saw that the king had fallen,  
Their courage failed them, and in great swiftness,  
They went all in ranks to the sea;  
And the battle poet was driving them.

54

Amongst the warriors in turn,  
It was the Osgar that was urging them.  
After he had given the war  
Came succour to the hero of bright arms.

55

For through the spear-holes there might go  
The sickles ( [156-3](pt323.htm#xref_156-3)) through the back of
Osgar.

'An laoch sin bu mhò dhe 'n t-sliochd  
A thainig thugainn le 'mhor fheachd  
'Sann daibhsan bu chuing' an crò  
Ma'n do sgaoileadh an garth sgleo.

Mharbh Osgar, an tiugh an t-sluaigh,  
Ceud fear sleagha mar cheud uair,  
Ceud eil' as a' phobull a tri,  
Ag iarraidh thun an ard righ.

52

Ceud eile de shluagh nam fear  
An taobh thall de righ Lochlann,  
Gus an do mharbh e, 'n tiugh an t-sluaigh,  
An righ air mheud onarach.

Nuair chunnaic iad gun d' thuit an righ  
Threig am meanmna iad 's am mor luathas:  
Chaidh iad 'nan sreathan gu sàil,  
’S a' chliar chatha 'gan iomain.

Eadar na saoidhean mu seach  
’S e'n t-Osgar a bha 'gan iomain;  
An deis a bhith tabhairt a' bhlair,  
'S ann thainig cobhair gu laoch arm-ghil.

Oir rachadh, roimh thollaibh nan sleagh,  
Na corran roimh dhriom Osgair.

Whatever that day might hap to be  
On the battle steep side of Beinn-Eudainn,  
Such like great peril was not there found  
From the first of the Finne till one day

On the day when the Fhinn were on Oirill's Mound.

Wrote down this poem from the recitation of Angus MacDonald,
Staoine-breac, South Uist, September 1860, and again from that of Allan
MacPhie, tailor. MacDonald gives the same authority for it as for the
"Great Fool," and MacPhie says he learnt it from one Donald MacIntyre,
who has gone to America, and if living is now about 80 years of age. In
Barra, I heard it from Alexander MacDonald, Burgh; and from Donald
MacPhie, smith, Brubhaig, who learnt it from an uncle of his, Hector
MacLaine, also a smith. Some versions have lines which are wanting in
others, and in some lines there are a few slight variations. I have
inserted those lines and words which I thought best when differences
occurred.

H. M‘L.

\(1\) Maclean translates this brushwood, but the carlin was bald, and I
have heard the word used to express a picture on a shield of some large
bird, like an eagle, which is often mentioned in stories as
"Creveenach." The word may have something to do with Griffin, or Tree
Lion.

(<span id="xref_156-2">156-2</span>) This warrior is said to have given
the name to Glengarry. There are legends about him still current in that
neighbourhood.

(<span id="xref_156-3">156-3</span>) Herons is the more evident meaning,
but corr means any crooked instrument. The line occurs elsewhere.

The footnote reference numbers included in the Gaelic text of this poem
don't appear to refer to any notes in the text. Only notes 2 and 3 in
the English have corresponding reference numbers. I have retained the
numbers in the text as superscripts--JBH.

\[In translating this, I have aimed at giving the meaning of each line,
at imitating the rhythm of the original, as well as I could, and at
giving the same amount of rhyme, where I was able to hit upon rhymes
that would not altar the meaning. MacLean's manuscript is not divided
into quatrains, but I have heard this chanted, and the measure, and the
music, and the meaning, all

Ge b' e bhitheadh an latha sin  
Air taobh uchd-catha Bheinn Eudainn;  
A leithid de bhaoghal cha d' fhuaras ann,  
O thùs na Finne gus an aon latha,

'S latha dha 'n Fhinn air tulach Oirill.

point to a division into quatrains. I am indebted to 'the collector for
a literal translation, which has been of the greatest assistance; but I
have here and there followed Armstrong's Dictionary, which contains many
rare words, avowedly taken from the Ossianic poems. If there be errors
in the translation, I hope they may be overlooked.

MacDonald, who sang this and two other poems to me in Barra, September
10, 1860, did it with only one mistake. He forgot something near the
beginning, and stopped short, and uttering several expressions of strong
disgust at his own forgetfulness, he turned back to the first line and
began again, and got over the difficulty with a rush that reminded me of
a man taking a running leap over a stiff hedge. With that one mistake he
recited a whole poem; and so far as I can judge, from hearing such
crabbed Gaelic once, it was the same poem which is here given, but we
made out that there were fourscore verses in it, whereas there are but
fifty-five incomplete in MacLean's manuscript.

I observed that, two or three times, in reciting this and other poems,
MacDonald repeated a couple of lines to fill up the time and complete a
quatrain.

The poem was attributed to Oisean, and whoever composed it, clearly did
so in the character of that old half mythical bard, for he speaks like
an eye-witness, and dwells on the prowess of *his* son Osgar. I am

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

not sufficiently acquainted with early Norwegian and Irish history, to
be able to guess at the event which is celebrated, or at a date, but I
suspect the poem was composed in remembrance of some real invasion of
Ireland by the sea rovers of Lochlann, in which they got the worst of
the fight, and that it has been preserved traditionally in the Hebrides
ever since. Could it be Brian's famous battle, A.D. 1014. MacLean has
named his authorities; one of them, MacDonald, is referred to above. He
is a workman who cannot read, and who speaks no language but Gaelic. He
is a fine intelligent man, with a clear gray eye and smooth dark hair,
very fond of the old poetry of his native country, and charmed to recite
it to an audience able to take an interest in it. The audience was a
numerous one on the 10th of September, and we were highly attentive. One
woman was industriously weaving in a corner, another was carding wool,
and a girl was spinning dexterously with a distaff made of a rough
forked birch-branch, and a spindle which was little better than a
splinter of fir. In the warm nook behind the fire sat a girl with one of
those strange foreign faces which are occasionally to be seen in the
Western Isles, and which are often supposed by their neighbours to mark
the descendants of the Spanish crews of the wrecked armada--a face
which, at the time, reminded me of the Nineveh sculptures, and of faces
seen in St. Sebastian. Her hair was as black as night, and her clear
dark eyes glittered through the peat smoke. Her complexion was dark, and
her features so unlike those who sat about her, that I asked if she were
a native of the island, and learned that she was a Highland girl. Old
men and young lads, newly returned from the eastern fishing, sat about
on benches fixed to the wall, and

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

smoked and listened; and MacDonald sat on a low stool in the midst, and
chanted forth his lays amidst suitable remarks and ejaculations of
praise and sympathy. One of the poems was the Lay of Diarmaid, much the
same as it appears here; as I had got it from MacLean, who had written
it from the dictation of another man elsewhere. "Och! och!--aw! is not
that sad?" said the women when Diarmaid was expiring, One of the
audience was a stranger from the south, a Campbell, who had come to
Barra from some other place, and who, as usual, hailed me as a kinsman,
claimed Diarmaid as our common ancestor, and MacCalain Mor as the head
of his family. His hair was yellow, though tinged with white; and
amongst the short, dark natives of Barra, be looked large, and gaunt,
and bony. He gave me his prose version of the escape and pursuit of
Diarmaid and Graidhne, and brought the fugitives from Ireland to the
Isle of Skye. The main incidents were similar to those already given,
but in detail they differed entirely, as all versions which I have, do
from each other. The house where our meeting was held was one of those
which are only to be found in the far west, and this may serve to give a
notion of the people, who still preserve and delight in this old Gaelic
poetic lore.

May 11, 1861.--Since this was printed, I have found a version of "Duan a
Mhuirearteach" in a collection of Gaelic poetry, made by Hugh Gillies,
and printed in 1786 at Perth. I am indebted to the Rev. Mr. MacLauchlan
for a loan of the book, which is rare, and which I had sought in vain at
the British Museum and elsewhere. There are 112 lines arranged in
stanzas in the published version; 213 in the traditional version here
given.

The story, and some lines of the poetry, also appear in the proceedings
of the antiquaries of Scotland (vol. iii., part ii. 1861), these are
taken from a MS. collection made in Lewis. It appears that the heroine
was wife of a superhuman Celtic sea smith, who is a kind of Neptune, and
who had been maltreated by the Feen.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

Another version of the poem was written from the dictation of a man at
Gairloch ten years ago; and another has lately been written by Mr.
Torrie in Benbecula, from the recitation of an old beggar wife.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[137:1](pt323.htm#fr_18) In Gillies, this
character is a man, and called "A Mhuireart-each"; perhaps muir
iarteach,--sea western.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[141:1](pt323.htm#fr_19) Another version
is,--O'n ti a tharladh mi thugaibh.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[142:1](pt323.htm#fr_20) See No. LXVIII.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[144:1](pt323.htm#fr_21) It seems that she was
the wife of a superhuman Celtic sea smith, who goes by the name of
Bulcan sometimes.

from one camp to an other.
