### LXIII.

### HOW THE COCK TOOK A TURN OUT OF THE FOX, AND NO CREATURE EVER TOOK A TURN OUT OF HIM BUT THAT COCK.

From Hector Boyd, Barra, Sept. 20, 1860.

THE russet dog came to a house, and he caught hold of a cock. He went
away with the cock, and the people of the town-land went away after him.

"Are they not silly!" quoth the cock, "going after thee, and that they
cannot catch thee at any rate."

The cock was for that he should open his mouth that he might spring out.

When he saw that the cock was so willing to go along with himself, he
was so pleased.

"Oh! musician, wilt thou not say--It is my own cock that is here, and
they will turn back," said the cock.

The fox said, "Shê-mo-haolach-hay-n-a-han;" and when the fox opened his
mouth the cock sprung away.

I have already given a version of this in Vol. II.; the main difference
is, that the cock here calls the fox a musician, as the fox in the old
story called the crow, when he did him out of a cheese by the same
stratagem. Ceolaire is used to express a silly fellow.
