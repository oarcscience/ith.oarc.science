### THE LAY OF THE GREAT FOOL.

1--BARD.

TALE of wonder that was heard without lie,  
Of the idiot to whom hosts yield,  
A haughty son who yields not to arms,  
Whose name was the mighty fool.

2\*

The might of the world he had seized  
In his hands, and it was no rude deed.  
It was not the strength of his blade or his shield,  
But that the mightiest was in his grasp.

On his falling on a hidden glen,  
Wherein he never before had staid,  
Of loveliest strath and grass and plain  
And sound of the waves 'gainst each bright stone. (See 5.)

ELK.--From a stone in the churchyard of Meigle.--*Sculptured Stones of
Scotland*, Pl. lxxii. *See note* (2).

Air tachairt a'n gleann diomhair dhò  
Anns nach robh e fos roimh riamh,  
A b' ailte srath a's fear a's fonn,  
Fuain nan tonn ri slios gach leug. (Gairloch 4.)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

3\*

Lasting long ere we had come,  
Many a chief is beneath his sway;  
Another little tale I'd tell,  
But it there discerned, and it is strange.

4†

A day when the mighty fool  
Was in Lochlan's bounds in a magic cloud,  
Himself and one beauteous dame,  
As a woman he beauty sufficed.

5

Meeting in a vast shore-glen,  
As a rose ever growing through it,  
Floods, and strife, and grass, and sound,  
Roar of waves on shore of sea.

6--GILVEEN.

"There was seen," said Gilveen young,  
"A gruagach of the yellowest cloak in the way,  
A new coloured vessel in his grasp, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24)  
Like to a cup in which was drink."

7†--FOOL.

It was then that the great hero spoke,  
"Is it an empty flower I see?  
It is, when greatest is my thirst,  
That it's coming were best for health."

8--GILVEEN.

"An earnest entreaty I make to thee,  
Drink not his draught, take not his food,  
Till thou knowest what is the glen  
Wherein thou wert, never before."

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

3\*

A leantuin fad air dhuine teachd  
’S iomadh ceud a tha fu 'smachd;  
Sgeul beag eile dh' innsean ann  
Tuigear thall 's gu bheil e ait.

4†

Latha do'n Amadan mhor,  
An criochan Lochlann fo cheo draodh,--  
E fhein agus aona mhaca mna;  
Bu leoir a h-ailleachd mar mhnai.

5

Tachairt an gleann diomhair, ròdh,  
Mar ròs fas roimhe riamh,  
Sionan, streubh, a's feur, a's fonn,  
Stoirm nan tonn ri stios na léi.

6

"Chunnacas," arsa Gilmhin og,  
"Gruagach 'san ròd a's buidh brot,  
Soitheach ur, daite 'na dorn <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25)  
Coltach ri corn am biodh deoch.

7†

Sin 'n uair labhair Macabh mor,  
"An e ròs fòs ( [190-1](pt325.htm#xref_190-1)) tha mi a reir?  
’San uair a's motha mo thart,  
’S gu'm b' fhearr a theachd gu beatha."

8

"Achanaich a dh' iarram's art,  
Na ol a dheoch 's na gabh a bhiadh,  
Gu fiosraich gu dé 'n gleann  
Nach robh thu ann roimhe riamh."

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

9†--GRUAGACH.

After that had been spoken to him,  
Out spoke the Gruagach of the Cup,  
"Be not downcast stalwart youth,  
Be merry and quaff thy draught."

10--BARD.

In the like commune with him  
Out spoke he, and it was no wise speech.  
He gave a haughty clashing dart,  
And there was no drop in the cup but he drank.

11

Away went the Gruagach of the Cup  
Unlucky was the cup to drink,  
The two legs down from the knee  
Were wanting to the mighty fool.

12--GILVEEN.

Then it was young Gilveen spoke,  
"Great is this woe has befallen thee,  
Scarce are thy friends in the great world  
Unliked by them is thy want of feet. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26)

13--FOOL.

"Hist! now thou Gilveen young,  
Cease thy woe and be thou still,  
No leg shall be under one in the land,  
Or I myself will get my two feet."

14†--BARD.

There they wended the pair,  
The woman and the hero of heaviest tread,  
Swifter was he on his two knees  
Than six at their swiftness of foot.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

9†

An deigh sin fhoclachadh dhò  
Gu 'n do bheannaich gruagach a' chuirn,  
"Na bi dubhach oglaich mhoir  
Bi subhuch a's ol do dheoch."

10

Air a' chomain chiadhna dhó,  
Labhair esan 's cha b' e 'ghloir ghlic;  
Thug e sitheadh bruaisgneach borb,  
’S cha robh braon 's a' chorn nach d' ibh.

11

Gu. 'n d' imich gruagach a' chuirn,  
Neo-bhuadhach a' chuirn ri ol;  
An da chois, fo'n ghluin-shios,  
Bha 'dhith an Amadain mhoir.

12

’Sin 'n uair labhair Gilmhin og,  
"’S mor am bron seo thainig ort,  
’S tearc do charaid 'san domhan mhor,  
’S ni neo-oil leo thu 'bhith gun chois." <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27)

13

"Uist a nis a Ghilmhin og,  
Sguir ad' bhron, a's bi nad' thosd;  
Cha bhi cas fo fhear as tir  
Neo gheibh mi fhin mo dha chois."

14†

Dh' imich iad an siud 'nan dis,  
A bhean 'san laoch bu truime trosd;  
Bu luaithe esan air a dha ghluin  
Na seisear air luathas an cos.

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

15

They heard the hunt in the glen,  
The voice of the hound and music sweet,  
Rapidly chasing the elk ( [190-2](pt325.htm#xref_190-2))  
On the moorland that suited best.

16

On the moorland that suited best  
Was seen the deer from the mountains wild,  
The red cared and very white hound  
Keenly baying upon his track.

17

Swiftly he gave a dart,  
That sudden cast with his keen blade,  
There was driven by force of the hero's hand  
The spear through the deer's two sides.

18--FOOL.

They caught hold of the white stag-hound,  
And out of hand put him on leash.  
"Be there making music by me,  
Till one come after thee from the chase."

19--BARD.

There was seen descending a glen  
A Gruagach in full splendour of gold,  
Hand on blade on his left side,  
And his two spears and his shield in his grasp.

20

Certes they asked a tale from him,  
Or what road the stranger used.  
\* They took an alternate tale about  
\* What was the land where they used to be.

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

15

Chual iad an fhaghaid 's a' ghleann  
Guth gadhair ann a 's binn ceol  
A' ruith na h-eilid gu than  
Air an fhireach a b' fhearr doigh.

16

Air an fhireach a b' fhearr doigh,  
Chunnacas fiadh o bheannaibh borb,  
’S gadhar cluas-dearg gle gheal  
A' tabhann gu geur 'na lorg.

17

Thug esan sitheadh gu grad;  
An urchair chlis ud le lann geur;  
Thártadh, le neart lamh an laoich,  
An t-sleagh roimh dha thaobh an Fheidh.

18

Bheir iad air a' ghadhar bhán,  
’S air a laimh gu 'n chuir air eill.  
"Bi tu agam deanadh ciuil  
Gu 'n d' thig fear o 'n iuil a' d' deigh."

19

Chunnacas a' tearnadh le gleann  
Gruagach ann lan dearsadh òir  
Lamh air lann air a thaobh cli,  
'S a dha shleagh 's a sgiath 'na dhorn.

20

Dh' fhoighneachd iad sgeul deth gu beachd,  
Na co 'n ròd a chleachd an aoidh?  
\* Gabh iad sgeula dheth mu seach,  
\* Ciod i n' tir a'n do chleachd a bhi.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

21--GRUAGACH.

"Ridire Corcair is my name,  
And on each spot I have victory won.  
I am the Gruagach of the white stag-hound  
That has fallen into thine hand."

22--FOOL.

"Thou Gruagach of the handsomest mien,  
I will give thee assurance of this  
That Gruagach of the white stag-hound  
Shall not henceforth be said to thee.

23\.

"Will't not suffice thee, mighty son,  
A make-weight or two to be in the scale?  
As the whole of the hunt is beneath thy power  
To leave the white stag-hound with me.

24--GRUAGACH.

"It is I, indeed, who made the hunt,  
As the idiot is wrathful and fierce,  
Whichever one is of strongest hand,  
His be the white stag-hound and the deer."

25 <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28)

"Since my stag-hound has fallen to thee,  
And thy feet are awanting,  
Food and clothing take thy desire  
I would give that to thee and thy wife.

26--GILVEEN.

"Accept that, said Gilveen young,  
And give the white stag-hound to him,"  
"I'll give him, and a speckled hound,  
And if it pleased thee, a greater thing."

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

21

"Ridire Corcair b'e m' ainm,  
’S air gach ball gu 'n d' thug mi buaidh.  
’S mise gruagach a' ghadhair bhàn  
A tharladh ann an laimh thu;"

22

"A Ghruagach ud a 's ailne dealbh  
Bheir mise 'dhearbhadh sin duit,  
Nach bi gruagach gadhair bain  
As an seo ri ràdh riut."

23

"Nach fhoghainn leatsa 'Mhice mhoir  
Leatrom no dha 'bhith 'san roinn,  
’S an t-seilg uile 'bhith fo d' bhinn,  
’S an gadhar bàn a leiginn leam."

24

"’S mise sin a rinn an t-seilg;  
Mar tha'n t-Amadan garg, dian;  
'S ge b' e neach a's treise lamh  
'S leis an gadhar bàn 's am fiadh."

25

"’S o tharlladh mo ghadhar ort,  
Agus do chosan gu d' dhìth,  
Biadh a's aodach, gabh d'a reir,  
Bheirinn dhuit fhein 's do d' mhnaoi.

26

"Gabh siud," arsa Gilmhin og,  
’S an gadhar bán a thoirt dhó."  
"Bheiream agus gadhar breac,  
’S na' b' aill leat na bu mhó."

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

27--BAIRD.

Then wended they on the three,  
Under the guidance of the man.  
He raised in the hollows of his shield  
The sling-shaft ( [190-3](pt325.htm#xref_190-3)), and the woman, and the
deer.

28

Then was seen, appearing aside,  
A still city filled with the glitter of gold,  
And there was no hue that eye hath seen  
That was not in plenty the court within.

29--FOOL.

Then asked the mighty fool,  
"What was the city of gold by the way,  
Of noblest form and most beauteous mien.  
Shall I find out from whence it came?"

30--GRUAGACH.

"Gold Yellow City is its name,  
From Mount Modest and glens of gloom," <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29)  
And there are in it of guileful men,  
But I only and my single dame.

31†

"Yonder glen that thou camest through,  
Full of glamour it is always,  
But little it has taught to me  
But to behold the worth of my dame.

32†

"A young wife that I found in the tower,  
The sight of an eye no better was,  
Whiter than very snow is her form,  
Gentle her eye and her teeth like a flower."

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

27

Dh' imich iad, an sin 'nan triuir,  
Anns an iuil a rin am fear;  
Thog e 'n crannagaibh a sgiath  
An crann-tabhuill, 's am fiadh, 's a' bhean.

28

Chunnacas a' tighinn ri taobh  
Cathair chaomh 's lan dearsadh oir  
’S cha robh dath a chunnaic suil  
Nach robh anns a' chuirt na 's leoir.

29

Dh' fhoighneachd an t-Amadan mor,  
"Co i 'chathair oir, ri 'h-iuil,  
A's breagh cruth 's is ailne dreach?  
'S am faigh mi mach co dheth a tùs?"

30

"’Chathair orbhuidh gu 'm b' e 'h-ainm  
O Dhun Tuirbh 's o ghleannta Smol,  
’S cha 'n 'eil innt' a dh'fhearaibh fòil  
Ach mise fòs a's m' aona bhean. <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30)

31

"An gleann sin roimh d' thainig thu trid  
Lan de dhraodhachd tha e 'ghnath;  
’S beag a dh' fhaoghluim e dhomh fhein  
Ach 'bhith 'g amharc beus mo mhná.

32†

"Bean og a fhuair mi 'san tur  
Nach robh amhare sùl na b' fhearr;  
’S gile na gach sneachd a corp,  
’S mall a rosg, 's a deud mar bhlath."

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

33 \*--LADY.

The dame of exceeding beauty blessed  
The Gruagach so lovely and brown.  
"Who is the lady stately and young,  
Or the big man thou hast yielded to?"

34 \*--GRUAGACH.

"The mighty Fool is his name,  
And his wife is the young Fairfine;  
The men of the world are at his beck,  
And the yielding to him was mine."

35 \*--LADY.

"I think marvellous what thou say'st,"  
So said the young Fairfine;  
"If the men of the world are at his beck,  
That he'd let his legs go with them."

36 \*--GRUAGACH.

"I'll give thee my word, oh dame,  
That the men of the world are at his beck  
And were it not glamour of Comain cross,  
He'd not let his legs go with them."

37

"And now that I may go to the chase,  
To the ruddy mountains and glens of gloom,  
Do thou watch, my brother of love,  
My house, my wife, and my store of gold!

38

"So long as I am without,  
Do thou nor slumber or droop thy head.  
Let never a man within  
Or a man out, if one come in."

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

33\*

Bheannaich a bhean a b' fhearr snuagh  
Do na Gruagach aluinn donn.  
"Co macan steud gheal og  
No 'm fear mor d'an d' thug thu geill?"

34\*

"An t-amadan mor gur e ainm.  
’S a Gheilbhinn og gur i 'bhean  
Fir an domhain tha gu 'mhein  
’S mise fein gu'n gheill da."

35\*

"’S ioghnadh leam na tha thu ag radh,"  
’Se labhair a Gheilbhinn og;  
"Fir an domhain gu bheil gu' mhein  
’S gu leigeadh e a chasan leo."

36\*

"Bheir mise mo bhriathra' bhean  
Fir an domhain gu bheil gu mhein;  
’S mar b' e druidheachd Chomain chrois  
Cha leigeadh e a chasan leò."

37

Gu'n d' theid mise 'nis a shealg  
A bheanntai dearg 's a ghleanntai smol;  
Mathaich thusa, 'bhrathair ghraidh,  
Mo theach, 's mo mhnai, 's mo chuid oir.

38

Cho fad 's gu'm bi mise muigh  
Na deansa lochd 's na crom do cheann  
Na leig duin' idir a steach;  
Na duine 'mach ma thig ann.'

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

39--BARD.

They went to the chase the three,  
The dog, and the Gruagach, and the white stag-hound.  
The two fair ones and the great son  
Stayed waiting within the city of gold.

40--FOOL.

Then outspoke the hero large,  
"Gilveen young, here at my head,  
A heavy sleep is enticing me.  
We did not yield up in the glen."

41 \*--BARD.

He was not long in his sleep  
A Gruagach came in from the way,  
And gave a kiss to the Gruagach's dame,  
And the lady was not ill pleased that he came.

42†--BARD AND GILVEEN.

The young wife sat beneath his head;  
In her mien she pictured a sun,  
And said she to the stalwart youth,  
"Thou hast slumbered, but not for thy good.

43

"Thou hast slumbered, but not for thy good.  
There came a mighty warrior in  
And gave a kiss to the Gruagach dame;  
Unlucky it is that the stranger came."

44--BARD.

Up rose the mighty fool,  
To the doorway went he,  
Never struck blacksmith, tinker, or wright  
A door more strongly than the angry wight.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

39

Dh' imich iad a shealg 'nan triuir  
An cu, 's an gruagach, 's an gadhar bán;  
An dithis ban 's am macabh mor  
Dh' fhan 's a' chathair oir ri h-iuil.

40

Sin do labhair Macabh mor,  
"Ghilmhin og seo aig mo cheann  
Tha 'n cadal trom 'gam bhuaireadh;  
Ni 'n òbamaid suas 's a' ghleann."

41\*

Cha b' fhada bha e na shuain  
Thainig Gruagach a' ròd a steach  
’S do bhean a Ghruagaich thug e pog  
’S cha b' fhuathach leis an oigh a theachd.

42†

Gu'n shuidh an og-bhean fo 'cheann  
Mac samhlaih dealbha i ri grein;  
’S thuirt i ris an oglach mhor,  
"Rinn thu suaimhneas, 's cha b' e t' fheum.

43

"Rinn thu suaimhneas, 's cha b' e t' fheum,  
Thainig gaisgeach treun a steach,  
’S do 'n mhnaoi Ghruagaich thug e pog;  
’S neo-bhuadhach an aoidh a theachd."

44

Dh' eiricn an t-Amadan mor;  
Thun an doruis a ghabh e.  
Cha d' bhuail gobha, ceard, na saor,  
Comhla, 's treise na 'n laoch borb.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

45 \*--FOOL.

"Unless I were sound enough  
He had not come in from the road,  
Till comes the Gruagach of the golden doon,  
With my will he goes not out."

46--GRUAGACH.

Up rose the warrior straight and brown,  
And the arms were seized by grasp.  
"Leave the doorway, stalwart youth,  
Thou art there instead of right."

47†--FOOL.

Thus answered the warrior great  
To the hero of the firm speech,  
"Till he comes, the Gruagach who is out,  
Thou shalt he in or thy head."

48\*

"Still will I give my vows,  
Though thou thinkest much of thy speech  
When comes the Gruagach of the golden doon  
He will repay thee for his wife's kiss."

49 \*--GRUAGACH.

"Wilt not suffice thee, thou mighty man,  
Seven vats full of glittering gold,  
Cattle and horses, and untaxed land,  
Plain of the plains and the woman's doon?"

50\*

"Thou mayest get that, and to boot,  
My tissue vesture and horse,  
Who's as ready on sea as on land,  
If thou wilt but let me go out."

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

45\*

"Mur bhithinn a' m' shuain gu leor  
Cha tigeadh e a' rod a steach,  
'S gus an tig Gruagach dun an oir  
Le mo dheoin cha teid e mach."

46

Dh' eirich an gaisgeach deas, donn,  
’S ghlacadh leis na h-airm 'na dhorn,  
"Fag an dorus oglaich mhoir;  
An aite coir a bhiodh tu ann."

47†

Air freagairt do Mhacabh mor,  
Air a' ghaisgeach na gloir theann,  
"Gu 'n d' thig an gruagach tha muigh  
Bidh tusa steach no do cheann."

48\*

"Bheir mise mo bhriathra fos  
Ge mor leat na bheil thu ag radh;  
Nuair thig Gruagach dun an oir  
Gu'n diol e ort pog a mhna."

49\*

"Nach foghnadh leatsa mhic a mhoir  
Seachd lan dabhaich 'a dh'or glan  
Crodh a's eich fearann saor  
Raon nan raon a's dun nam ban."

50\*

"Gheibheadh tu sin a's ni 's mó  
Mo chulaidh shroil agus m' each  
’S co deas leis muir agus tìr  
A chionn mo ligeadh a mach."

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

51 \*--FOOL.

"Still will I give my vows,  
Though thou thinkest much of thy speech  
When comes the Gruagach of the tissue cloak,  
He will repay thee for his wife's kiss."

52--GRUAGACH.

"From the Gruagach of the Cup I got  
Thy one foot to let me in;  
I'll blow it beneath thee with joy  
If thou leave the way to go out."

53--BARD.

With his own magic he blew  
His one foot beneath him as ever it was,  
And said the Gruagach, who was wise,  
"It is time for me now to depart."

54--FOOL.

Thus answered the warrior great,  
"A little stay yet for a slow space,  
The other foot for a sturdy step,  
I'll take from thee or thy head."

55--GRUAGACH.

When the hero was in hard straits,  
He suddenly sprang to the breast of his dame;  
"My comeliness I throw upon thee,  
Guard me my feet and my hand."

56 †--FOOL.

"If death be a terror to thee,  
For the poor wife of most beauteous mien,  
The other foot thou wouldst give away  
A refuge in that hour for thy head."

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

51 \*

"Bheir mise mo bhriathra fos  
Ge mor leat na bheil thu ag radh  
Gu'n tig Gruagach a bhrait shroil  
'S gu'n diol c ort pog a mhna."

52

"Fhuair mi o ghruagach a' chuirn  
Do leith chos a m' leig a steach;  
Seideam fodhad i gu m' dheoin,  
’S ma leigeas an ròd a mach."

53

Shéid esan le dhraodhachd fhein  
A leith-chos foidh mar bha i riamh  
’S thuirt an gruagach a bha glic,  
"Gur tim dhomh bhith nis a triall."

54

Air freagairt do Mhacabh mor,  
"Stad beag fathasd gu fòil mall;  
A chas eile gu ceum cruaidh  
Bheir mise uait no do cheann."

55†

’Nuair a bha 'n gaisgeach an càs cruaidh,  
Duibh leum gu, luath ri uchd na mnai,  
"Tilgidh mi mo chuimrin ( [190-4](pt325.htm#xref_190-4)) ort;  
Dion domh mo chosan 's mo lamh."

56†

"Ma 's h-eagal leat am bàs,  
Do 'n ghraidh-bhean a's ailne dealbh  
A' chas eile bheireadh tu uait;--  
Didean, air an uair, dho d' cheann."

57 †--BARD.

He was not allowed to come to words,  
When the great one was upon him,  
And unless t' other foot was given him  
Slice in two! ere he could cry for Fionn.

50 \*--GRUAGACH.

Then with his own glamour he put  
His two legs under him as they were,  
And said the Gruagach, who was wise,  
"It is time for me now to begone."

59--FOOL.

"These feet I have now got below  
I yield not to thee nor to them,  
The day will not come that thou goest out,  
Till comes the Gruagach of the golden doon."

60--GRUAGACH.

"I am the Gruagach of the golden doon,  
And great is my boast of thy good will,  
And (I am) the Gruagach of the white stag hound  
That fell into thy hand,

61 †

"And that took these feet off thee  
To try thy courage and thy force;  
I blow them beneath thee again,  
Right as straight as thou wert."

62 \*

"Youth of most beauteous mein,  
I esteem thee great in each thing;  
It was I took thy leg off thee  
To try thy valour and mind."

57t

Cha d' leigeadh gu focail dhò  
Nuair bha 'm fear mor as a chionn;  
'S gun a chos eile thoir dhò,  
Sgiol na dhò ma 'n goirear Fionn.

58\*

Chuir e'n sin lè dhruideachd fein  
A dha chos fodha mar bha, iad riamh  
S thu'irt an Gruagach a bha glic  
"’S mithich a nis a bhi triall."

59

"Na casan seo fhuair mi fodham  
Cha leig mi leat iad na leo.  
Cha d' thig an la a theid thu mach  
Gus an d' thig gruagach Dhun an oir."

60

"’S mise gruagach Dhun an oir,  
’S bu mhor mo bhosd as do ruin,  
Agus gruagach gadhair bhàin  
A tharladh ann an lamh thu.

61 t

"’S a thug na cosan ud diot  
A dhearbadh do ghniomh a's do lugh;  
Seideam fodhad iad a rìs  
Cheart cho direach 's a bha thu."

62 \*

"Oganaich is ailte dreach  
Gur mor mo bheach ort 's gach cuis;  
’S gur mi bhun do chasan d' iot  
A dhearbhadh do ghniomh 's do thurn."

63--BARD.

Then they laid hold hand on hand,  
Love on love, and good will on good will,  
One little tale on the dames, <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31)  
A wondrous tale heard without a lie.

(<span id="xref_190-1">190-1</span>) Fàs, empty. Ròs, a flower--probably
the cap is called a flower.

(<span id="xref_190-2">190-2</span>) The word is translated hind, roe,
etc. It is the same word as elk, but it means a stag here.

(<span id="xref_190-3">190-3</span>) Crann tabhail is translated "sling"
in Armstrong; but tabhail, according to the same authority, is
"catapult;" "Crann" is a tree. It seems, then, that the word means some
instrument made partly of wood, and used in the chase; and I suspect it
means cross-bow. Men are represented on the sculptured stones of
Scotland shooting with cross-bows. *See* [p. 100](pt310.htm#page_100).

(<span id="xref_190-4">190-4</span>) *Cuimeir*, neat, trim, well-formed,
elegance; *cuimrin*, my elegance, my elegant self.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

63

Rug iad an sin lamh air lamh;  
Gaol air ghaol a's mìnn air mhìnn;  
Aona sgeul beag air na mnai, <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32)  
Sgeul uamharr' a chualas gun bhreig.

CAOGAD, fifty. IBH, to drink.

SIONAN, I do not know this word, unless it is a corruption of sithean, a
knoll. STREUBH, I do not know unless it is a strath. The line might be
read this way--

Sithean, srath, a's fear a's fonn.  
Knoll, strath, grass, and land.

STIOS na lei, I think is slios na lei. LIA, an old name for a stream; on
the side of the stream. RÒDH, I suspect, is "very extensive." MACA MNA,
is, I think, a superior women.

SÒITHEACH UR DAITE na dorn, should be, I think, 'na dhorn.

H. M‘L.

On the authority of Armstrong, and taking similar words, I have put a
meaning on the doubtful line, but I am not sure that it is correct. See
various readings, footnote.
