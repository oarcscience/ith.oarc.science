<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW THE COCK TOOK A TURN OUT OF THE FOX,<BR>
AND NO CREATURE EVER TOOK A TURN OUT OF HIM BUT THAT COCK.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="-1">From Hector Boyd, Barra, Sept. 20, 1860.</FONT></P>
<P>THE russet dog came to a house, and he caught hold of a cock. He went away with the cock, and the people of the town-land went away after him.</P>
<P>"Are they not silly!" quoth the cock, "going after thee, and that they cannot catch thee at any rate."</P>
<P>The cock was for that he should open his mouth that he might spring out.</P>
<P>When he saw that the cock was so willing to go along with himself, he was so pleased.</P>
<P>"Oh! musician, wilt thou not say--It is my own cock that is here, and they will turn back," said the cock.</P>

<P>The fox said, "Sh&ecirc;-mo-haolach-hay-n-a-han;" and when the fox opened his mouth the cock sprung away.</P>
<P>I have already given a version of this in Vol. II.; the main difference is, that the cock here calls the fox a musician, as the fox in the old story called the crow, when he did him out of a cheese by the same stratagem. Ceolaire is used to express a silly fellow.</P>
