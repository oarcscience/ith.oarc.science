<P>
Some of these books and texts are translations of Celtic legends
and sagas; others are retellings of the material, folklore, or
literary works based on Celtic themes.
During the 19th and early 20th Century there was a resurgence of interest in
the folklore of Ireland, Wales and Scotland.  This was reflected in
a huge amount of literature based on the rich Celtic mythopoetic heritage,
most of it very faithful to the original material,
some in a more modern voice.</P>

<P>
A good number of these files were originally scanned by Phillip
Brown for his (now defunct) Celtic Folklore website.
These are indicated by [PB].

Lady Augusta Gregory was a close collaborator with W.B. Yeats, the Irish poet
and mystic.  These three books are her retellings of Irish mythology and
folklore, and are among the best of the genre.
