The Stolen Bride

> ABOUT the year 1670 there was a fine young fellow living at a place
> called Querin, in the County Clare. He was brave and strong and rich,
> for he had his own land and his own house, and not one to lord it over
> him. He was called the Kern of Querin. And many a time he would go out
> alone to shoot the wild fowl at night along the lonely strand and
> sometimes cross over northward to the broad east strand, about two
> miles away, to find the wild geese.

> One cold frosty November Eve He was watching for them, crouched down
> behind the ruins of an old hut, when a loud splashing noise attracted
> his attention. "It is the wild geese," he thought, and raising his
> gun, waited in death-like silence the approach of his victim.

> But presently he saw a dark mass moving along the edge of the strand.
> And he knew there were no wild geese near him. So he watched and
> waited till the black mass came closer, and then he distinctly
> perceived four stout men carrying a bier on their shoulders, on which
> lay a corpse covered with a white cloth. For a few moments they laid
> it down, apparently to rest themselves, and the Kern instantly fired;
> on which the four men ran away shrieking, and the corpse was left
> alone on the bier. Kern of Querin immediately sprang to the place, and
> lifting the cloth from the face of the corpse, beheld by the freezing
> starlight, the form of a beautiful young girl, apparently not dead but
> in a deep sleep.

> Gently he passed his hand over her face and raised her up, when she
> opened her eyes and looked around with wild wonder, but spake never a
> word, though he tried to soothe and encourage her. Then, thinking it
> was dangerous for them to remain in that place, he raised her from the
> bier, and taking her hand led her away to his own house. They arrived
> safely, but in silence. And for twelve months did she remain with the
> Kern, never tasting food or speaking word for all that time.

> When the next November Eve came round, he resolved to visit the east
> strand again, and watch from the same place, in the hope of meeting
> with some adventure that might throw light on the history of the
> beautiful girl. His way lay beside the old ruined fort called
> *Lios-na-fallainge* (the Fort of the Mantle), and as he passed, the
> sound of music and mirth fell on his ear. He stopped to catch the
> words of the voices, and had not waited long when he heard a man say
> in a low whisper--"Where shall we go to-night. to carry off a bride?"
> And a second voice answered--Wherever we go I hope better luck will be
> ours than we had this day twelvemonths."

> "Yes," said a third; "on that night we carried off a rich prize, the
> fair daughter of O'Connor; but that clown, the Kern of Querin, broke
> our spell and took her from us. Yet little pleasure has he had of his
> bride, for she has neither eaten nor drank nor uttered a word since
> she entered his house."

> "And so she will remain," said a fourth," until he makes her eat off
> her father's table-cloth, which covered her as she lay on the bier,
> and which is now thrown up over the top of her bed."

> On hearing all this, the Kern rushed home, and without waiting even
> for the morning, entered the young girl's room, took down the
> table-cloth, spread it on the table, laid meat and drink thereon, and
> led her to it. "Drink," he said, "that speech may come to you." And
> she drank, and ate of the food, and then speech came. And she told the
> Kern her story--how she was to have been married to a young lord of
> her own country, and the wedding guests had all assembled, when she
> felt herself suddenly ill and swooned away, and never knew more of
> what had happened to her until the Kern had passed his hand over her
> face, by which she recovered consciousness, but could neither eat nor
> speak, for a spell was on her, and she was helpless.

> Then the Kern prepared a chariot, and carried home the young girl to
> her father, who was like to die for joy when he beheld her. And the
> Kern grew mightily in O'Connor's favour, so that at last he gave him
> his fair young daughter to wife; and the wedded pair lived together
> happily for many long years after, and no evil befell them, but good
> followed all the work of their hands.

> This story of Kern of Querin still lingers in the faithful, vivid
> Irish memory, and is often told by the peasants of Clare when they
> gather round the fire on the awful festival of *Samhain,* or November
> Eve, when the dead walk, and the spirits of earth and air have power
> over mortals, whether for good or evil.
