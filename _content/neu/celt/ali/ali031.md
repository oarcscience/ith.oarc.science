The Death Sign

> A woman was out one day looking after her sheep in the valley, and
> coming by a little stream she sat down to rest, when suddenly she
> seemed to hear the sound of low music, and turning round, beheld at
> some distance a crowd of people dancing and making merry. And she grew
> afraid and turned her head away not to see them. Then close by her
> stood a young man, pale and strange looking, and she beheld him with
> fear.

> "Who are you?" she said at last; "and why do you stand beside me?"

> "You ought to know me," he replied, "for I belong to this place; but
> make haste now and come away, or evil will befall you."

> Then she stood up and was going away with him, when the crowd left off
> their dancing and ran towards them crying--

> "Come back; come back; come back!"

> "Don't stop; don't listen," said the young man, "but follow me." Then
> they both began to run, and ran on until they reached a hillock.

> "Now we are safe," said he "they can't harm us here." And when they
> stopped he said to her again, "Look me in the face and say if you know
> me now?"

> "No," she answered, "you are a stranger to me."

> "Look again," he said, "look me straight in the face and you will know
> me."

> Then she looked, and knew instantly that he was a man who had been
> drowned the year before in the dark winter time, and the waves had
> never cast up his body on the shore. And she threw up her arms and
> cried aloud--

> "Have you news of my child? have you seen her, my fair-haired girl,
> that was stolen from me this day seven years. Will she come back to me
> never no more?"

> "I have seen her," said the man, "but she will never come back, never
> more, for she has eaten of the fairy food and must now stay with the
> spirits under the sea, for she belongs to them body and soul. But go
> home now, for it is late, and evil is near you; and perhaps you will
> meet her sooner than you think."

> Then as the women turned her face homeward, the man disappeared and
> she saw him no more.

> When at last she reached the threshold of her house a fear and
> trembling came on her, and she called to her husband that some one
> stood in the doorway and she could not pass. And with that she fell
> down on the threshold on her face, but spake no word more. And when
> they lifted her up she was dead.
