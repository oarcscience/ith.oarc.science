Queen Maeve

> A REMARKABLE account is given in the Bardic-Legends of a form that
> appeared to Maeve, queen of Connaught, on the eve of battle.

> Suddenly there stood before the queen's chariot, a tall and beautiful
> woman. She wore a green robe clasped with a golden bodkin, a golden
> fillet on her head, and seven braids for the Dead of bright gold were
> in her hand. Her skin was white as snow that falls in the night; her
> teeth were as pearls: her lips red as the berries of the mountain ash;
> her golden hair fell to the ground; and her voice was sweet as the
> golden harp-string when touched by a skilful hand.

> "Who art thou, O woman?" asked the queen, in astonishment.

> "I am Feithlinn, the fairy prophetess of the Rath of Crdachan," she
> answered.

> "'Tis well, O Feithlinn the prophetess," said Maeve; "but what dost
> thou foresee concerning our hosts?"

> "I foresee bloodshed; I foresee power; I foresee defeat!" answered the
> prophetess.

> " My couriers have brought me good tidings!" said the queen; "my army
> is strong, my warriors are well prepared. But speak the truth, O
> prophetess; for my soul knows no fear."

> "I foresee bloodshed; I foresee victory!" answered the prophetess the
> second time.

> " But I have nothing to fear from the Ultonians," said the queen, "for
> my couriers have arrived, and my enemies are under dread. Yet, speak
> the truth, O prophetess, that. our hosts may know it."

> "I foresee bloodshed; I foresee conquest; I foresee *death!'"*
> answered the prophetess, for the third time.

> "To me then it belongs not, this prophecy of evil," replied the queen,
> in anger.

> "Be it thine, and on thy own head."

> And even as she spoke the prophet maiden disappeared, and thie queen
> saw her no more.

> But it so happened that, some time afterwards, Queen Maeve was cruelly
> slain by her own kinsman, at Lough Rea by the Shannon, to avenge the
> assistance she had given in war to the king of Ulster; there is an
> island in the lake where is shown the spot where the great queen was
> slain, and which is still known to the people as--the
>
> stone of the dead queen.

> Maeve, the great queen of Connaught, holds a distinguished place in
> Bardic Legends. When she went to battle, it is said, she rode in an
> open car, accompanied by four chariots--one before, another behind,
> and one on each side--so that the golden *assion* on her head and her
> royal robes should not be defiled by the dust of the horses' feet, or
> the foam of the fiery steeds for all the sovereigns of Ireland sat
> crowned with a diadem in battle, as they drove in their war-chariots,
> as well as in the festal and the public assemblies.
