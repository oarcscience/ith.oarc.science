Omens that Forebode Evil

> To stick a pxxxxxx in the mast of a boat when sailing is most unlucky,

> To meet woman with red hair, or a woman with a red petticoat, the
> first thing in the morning.

> To kill the robin redbreast.

> To pass a churn and not give a helping hand.

> To meet a funeral and not go back three steps with it.

> To have a hare cross your path before sunrise.

> To take away a lighted sod on May days or churning days; for fire is
> the most sacred of all things, and you take away the blessing from the
> house along with it.

> \*

> The Irish are very susceptible to omens. They say, "Beware of a
> childless woman who looks fixedly at your child."

> Fire is the holiest of all things. Walk three times round a fire on
> St. John's Eve, and you will be safe from disease for all that year.

> lt is particularly unlucky to meet a red-haired man the first thing in
> the morning. There is a tradition that Judas Iscariot had red hair,
> and it is from this the superstitious dread of the evil interference
> of a red-haired man may have originated.

> Never begin work on a Friday.

> Never remove from a house or leave a situation on Saturday.

> Never begin to make a dress on Saturday, or the wearer will die within
> the year.

> Never mend a rent in a dress while on, or evil and malicious reports
> will be spread about you.

> Some days are unlucky to certain families--as Tuesday to the Tudors.
> Henry VIII., Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth all died upon a Tuesday.

> To throw a slipper after a party going a journey is lucky. Also to
> breakfast by candle-light on Christmas morning.

> It is fatal at a marriage to tie a knot in a red handkerchief, and
> only an enemy would do it. To break the spell tire handkerchief should
> be burned.

> The first days of the year and of the week are the luckiest. Never
> begin a journey on a Friday or Saturday, nor move from your residence,
> nor change a situation. Never cut out a dress or begin to make it on a
> Friday, nor fix a marriage, for of all days the fairies have the most
> malific power on a Friday. They are present then, and hear all that is
> said, therefore beware of speaking ill of them, for they will work
> some evil if offended.

> Never pay away money on the first Monday of the year, or you will lose
> your luck in gaining money all the year after.

> Presents may be given on New Year's Day, but no money should be paid
> away.

> Those who marry in autumn will die in spring.

> The yew-tree, the ash, and the elder-tree were sacred. The willow has
> a mystery in it of sound. The harp of King Brian-Boru was made of
> willow-wood.

> When a servant leaves her place, if her mistress gives her a piece of
> bread let her put by some of it carefully, for as long as she has it
> good luck will follow her.
