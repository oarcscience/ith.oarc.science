<P ALIGN="CENTER">Various Superstitions and Cures</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THERE is a book, a little book, and the house which has it will never be burned; the ship that holds it will never founder; the woman who keeps it in her hand will be safe in childbirth. But none except a fairy man knows the name of the book, and he will not reveal it for love or money; only on his death-bed will he tell the secret of the name to the one person he selects.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The adepts and fairy doctors keep their mysteries very secret, and it is not easy to discover the word of a charm, for the operator loses his power if the words are said without the proper preliminaries, or if said by a profane person without faith, for the operator should not have uttered the mystery in the hearing of one who would mock, or treat the matter lightly; therefore he is punished.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some years ago an old man lived in Mayo who had great knowledge of charms, and of certain love philtres that no woman could resist. But before his death he enclosed the written charms in a strong iron box, with directions that no one was to dare to open it except the eldest son of an eldest son in a direct line from himself.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people pretend that they have read the charms; and one of them has the strange power to make every one in the house begin to dance, and they can never cease dancing till another spell has been said over them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the guardian of the iron box is the only one who knows the magic secret of the spell, and he exacts a good price before he utters it, and so reveals or destroys the witchcraft of the dance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The juice of deadly night-shade distilled, and given in a drink, will make the person who drinks believe whatever you will to tell him, and choose him to-believe.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A bunch of mint tied round the waist is a sure remedy for disorders of the stomach.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><BLOCKQUOTE>A. </I>sick person's bed must be placed north and south, not cross ways.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nettles gathered in a churchyard and boiled down for a drink have the power to cure dropsy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The touch from the hand of a seventh son cures the bite of a mad dog. This is also an Italian superstition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hand of a dead man was a powerful incantation, But it was chiefly used by women. The most eminent fairy women always collected the mystic herbs for charms and cures by the light of a candle held by a dead man's hand at midnight or by the full moon.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a woman first takes ill in her confinement, unlock instantly every press and drawer in the house, but when the child is born, lock them all up again at once, for if care is not taken the fairies will get in and hide in the drawers and presses, to be ready to steal away the little mortal baby when they get the opportunity, and place some ugly, wizened changeling in the cradle beside the poor mother. Therefore every key should be turned, every lock made fast.; and if the fairies are hidden inside, let them stay there until all danger is over for the baby by the proper precautions being taken, such as a red coal set. under the cradle, and a branch of mountain ash tied over it, or of the alder-tree, according to the sex of the child, for both trees have mystic virtues, probably because of the ancient superstition that the first man was created from an alder-tree, and the first woman from the mountain ash.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fairies, however, are sometimes successful in carrying off a baby, and the mother finds in the morning a poor weakly little sprite in the cradle in place of her own splendid child. But should time mortal infant happen to grow up ugly, the fairies send it back, for they love beauty above all timings; and the fairy chiefs greatly desire a handsome mortal wife, so that a handsome girl must be well guarded, or they will carry her off. The children of such unions grow up beautiful and clever, but are also wild, reckless and extravagant. They are known at once by the beauty of their eyes and hair, and they have a magic fascination that no one can resist, and also a fairy gift of music and song.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a person is bitten by a dog, time dog must be killed, whether mad or not, for it might become mad; then, so also would the person who had been touched by the saliva of time animal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If, by accident, you find time back tooth of a horse, carry it about with you as long as you live, and you will never want money; but it must be found by chance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a family has been carried off by fever, the house where they died may be again inhabited with safety if a certain number of sheep are driven in to sleep there for three nights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An iron ring worn on the fourth finger was considered effective against rheumatism by the Irish peasantry from ancient times.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Paralysis is cured by stroking, but many forms and mystic incantations are also used during the process; and only certain persons have the power in the hands that can effect a cure by the magic of the stroke.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The seed of docks tied to time left arm of a woman will prevent her being barren.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Clippings of the hair and nails of a child tied up in a linen cloth and placed under the cradle will cure convulsions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><BLOCKQUOTE>Tober Maire </I>(Mary's well), near Dundalk, has a great reputation for cures. And thousands used to visit it on Lady Day for weak eyesight, and the lowness of heart. Nine times they must go round the well on their knees, always westward. Then drink a cup of the water, and not only are they cured of their ailment, but are as free from sin as time angels in heaven.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When children are pining away, they are supposed to be fairy-struck; and the juice of twelve leaves of foxglove may be given: also in cases of fever time same.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>People ought to remember that egg-shells are favourite retreats of the fairies, therefore the judicious eater should always break the shell after use, to prevent the fairy sprite from taking up his lodgment therein.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finvarra, the king of the fairies of the west, keeps up the most friendly relations with most of the best families of Galway, especially with time Kirwans of Castle Racket, for Finvarra is a gentleman, every inch of him, and the Kirwans always leave out kegs of wine for him at night of the best Spanish wine. And in return, it is said, the wine vaults at Castle Racket are never empty, though the wine flows freely for all comers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a living worm is put in-to the hand of a child before he is baptized, and kept there till the worm is dead, that child will have power in after life to cure all diseases to which children are subject.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After being cured from a sickness, take an oath never to comb the hair on a Friday, that so the memory of the grace received may remain by this sign till your death. Or whenever you first see the new moon, kneel down and say an ave and a pater; this also is for memory of grace done.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>People born in the morning cannot see spirits or the fairy world; but those born at night have power over ghosts, and can see the spirits of the dead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In some parts of Ireland the people, it is said, on first seeing the new moon, fall on their knees and address her in a loud voice with the prayer: "O moon; leave us well as thou hast found us!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is unlucky to meet a cat, a dog, or a woman, when going out first in the morning; but unlucky above all is it to meet a woman with red hair the first thing in the morning when going on a journey, for her presence brings ill-luck and certain evil.</BLOCKQUOTE>

If the disease is to end fatally the atones in the morning will emit a clear sound like a bell when struck together.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A whitethorn stick is a very unlucky companion on a journey; but a hazel switch brings good luck and has power over the devil.</BLOCKQUOTE>
