Omens and Superstitions

> AUGURIES and prophecies of coming fate may also be obtained from the
> flight of birds, the motion of the winds, from sneezing, dreams, lots,
> and the signs from a verse of the Psalter or Gospels. The peasantry
> attach great importance to the first verses of St. John's Gospel, and
> maintain that when the cock crows in the morning he is repeating these
> verses (from the 1st to the 14th), and if we understood the language
> of animals and birds, we could often hear them quoting these same
> verses.

>  A charm against sickness is an amulet worn round the neck, enclosing
> a piece of paper, on which is written the first three verses of St.
> John's Gospel.
