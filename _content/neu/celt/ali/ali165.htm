<P ALIGN="CENTER">Fairy Power</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is on Fridays that the fairies have the most power to work evil; therefore Friday is an unlucky day to begin work, or to go on a journey, or to have a wedding; for the spirits are then present everywhere, and hear and see everything that is going on, and will mar and spoil all they can, just out of malice and jealousy of the mortal race.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is then they strike cattle with their elfin sorrows, lame a horse, steal the milk, and carry off the handsome children, an ugly changeling in exchange, who is soon known to fairy sprite by its voracious appetite, without iany natural increase in growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This superstition makes the peasant-women often very crueI towards weakly children; and the trial by fire is sometimes resorted to in order to test the nature of the child who is suspected of being a changeling. For this purpose a fairy woman is usually sent for, who makes a drink for the little patient of certain herbs of whose power she alone has the secret knowledge, and a childless woman is considered the best to make the potion. Should there be no improvement in the child after the treatment with herbs, then the witch-women sometimes resorts to terrible measures to test the fairy nature of the sufferer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A child who was suspected of being a change because he was wasted and thin and always restless and fretful was ordered by the witch-woman to be placed for three nights on a shovel outside the door from sunset to sunrise, during which he was given foxglove to chew, and cold water was flung over him to banish the fire-devil. The screams of the child at night was frightful, calling on his mother to come and take him in; but the fairy doctor told the mother not to fear; the fairies were certainly tormenting him, but by the third night their power would cease, and the child, would be quite restored. However, on the third night the poor little child lay dead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
