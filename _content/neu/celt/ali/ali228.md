Captain Webb, The Robber Chief

> ABOUT a hundred years ago a most notorious robber, called Captain
> Webb, used to make the County Mayo his headquarters; and dreadful
> tales are still current amongst the people of his deeds of violence
> and cruelty.

> Many beautiful young girls he carried off by force or fraud; and when
> he grew tired of them it was his practice to strip the unhappy victims
> naked, and plunge them down a deep hole near Lough Corrib, which is
> still known throughout the county as "Captain Webb's hole"

> One day, however, fate worked out a revenge on the audacious
> highwayman by the hands of a woman.

> He had committed a daring robbery on the highroad--plundered a
> carriage, shot the horses, and carried off a noble and lovely girl,
> who was returning home with her mother from an entertainment, which
> had been given by a great lord in the vicinity. Consequently, as the
> robber knew, the ladies were dressed magnificently, and wore the most
> costly jewels. After stripping the mother of all her ornaments, he
> left her half dead upon the highway; but wrapping a cloak round the
> young lady, Captain Webb flung her on the horse before him and
> galloped off to one of the many hiding-places he had through the
> country.

> For some time he gave up all his other favourites for the sake of the
> beautiful girl, and carried her about with him on all his wild
> expeditions, so great was the madness of his love for her.

> But at length he grew tired even of her beauty, and resolved to get
> rid of her, in the same way as he had got rid of the others, by a
> cruel and sudden death.

> So one day, when she was out riding beside him, as he always forced
> her to do, he brought her to the fatal hole where so many of his
> victims had perished, intending to cast her down headlong as he had
> done to so many others; but first he told her to dismount and to take
> off all her rich garments of silk and gold and her jewels, for she
> would need them no longer.

> "For pity, then," she said, "do not look on me while I undress, for it
> is not seemly or right to look on a woman undressing; but turn your
> back and I shall unclasp my robe and fling it off."

> So the captain turned his back as she desired him, for he could not
> refuse her last request; but still he kept close to the edge of the
> hole ready to throw her in; when suddenly she sprang upon him, and
> placing both hands on his shoulders, pushed him over the edge down
> into the fathomless gulf, from which no mortal ever rose alive, and in
> this manner the country was freed for evermore from the terrible
> robber fiend, by the courage of a brave and beautiful girl.
