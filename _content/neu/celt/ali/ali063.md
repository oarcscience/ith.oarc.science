Marriage Rites

> IN old times in Ireland it was thought right and proper to seem to use
> force in carrying off the bride to her husband. She was placed on a
> swift horse before the bridegroom, while all her kindred started in
> pursuit with shouts and cries. Twelve maidens attended the bride, and
> each was placed on horseback behind the young men who rode after the
> bridal pair. On arriving at her future home, the bride was met on the
> threshold by the bride­groom's mother, who broke an oaten cake over
> her head as a good augury of plenty in the future. In the mountains
> where horses cannot travel, the bridal party walk in procession; the
> young men carrying torches of dried bogwood to light the bride over
> the ravines, for in winter the mountain streams are rapid and
> dangerous to cross.

>  The Celtic ceremonial of marriage resembles the ancient Greek ritual
> in many points. A traveller in Ireland some fifty years ago, before
> politics had quite killed romance and ancient tradition in the hearts
> of the people, thus describes a rustic marriage festival which he came
> on by chance one evening in the wilds of Kerry--

>  A large hawthorn tree that stood in the middle of a field near a
> stream was hung all over with bits of coloured stuff, while lighted
> rush candles were placed here and there amongst the branches, to
> symbolize, no doubt, the new life of brightness pre­paring for the
> bridal pair. Then came a procession of boys marching slowly with
> flutes and pipes made of hollow reeds, and one struck a tin can with a
> stick at intervals, with a strong rhythmical cadence. This represented
> the plectrum. Others rattled slates and bones between their fingers,
> and beat time, after the manner of the Crotolistrai--a rude attempt at
> music, which appears amongst all nations of the earth, even the most
> savage. A boy followed, bearing a lighted torch of bogwood. Evidently
> he was Hymen, and the flame of love was his cognizance. After him came
> the betrothed pair hand-in-hand, a large square canopy of black stuff
> being held over their heads; the emblem, of course, of the mystery of
> love, shrouded and veiled from the prying light of day.

>  Behind the pair followed two attendants bearing hung over the heads
> of the young couple a sieve filled with meal; a sign of the plenty
> that would be in their house, and an omen of good luck and the
> blessing of children.

>  A wild chorus of dancers and singers closed the procession; the
> chorus of the epithalamium, and grotesque figures, probably the
> traditional fauns and satyrs, nymphs and bacchanals, mingled together
> with mad laughter and shouts and waving of green branches.

>  The procession then moved on to a bonfire, evidently the ancient
> altar; and having gone round it three times, the black shroud was
> lifted from the bridal pair, amid they kissed each other before all
> the people, who shouted and waved their branches in approval.

>  Then the preparations for the marriage supper began, on which,
> however, the traveller left them, having laid some money on the altar
> as an offering of good-will for the marriage future. At the wedding
> supper there was always plenty of eating and drinking, and dancing and
> the feast were prolonged till near morning, when the wedding song was
> sung by the whole party of friends standing, while the bride and
> bridegroom remained seated at the head of the table. The chorus of one
> of these ancient songs maybe thus literally translated from the
> Irish--

> "It is not day, nor yet day,  
> It is not day, nor yet morning;  
> It is not day, nor yet day,  
> For the moon is shining brightly."

>  Another marriage song was sung in Irish frequently, each verse ending
> with the lines--

>  "There is sweet enchanting music, and the golden harps are ringing;  
> And twelve comely maidens deck the bride-bed for the bride."

>  A beautiful new dress was presented to the bride by her husband at
> the marriage feast; at which also the father paid down her dowry
> before the assembled guests; and all the place round the house was lit
> by torches when night came on, and the song and the dance continued
> till daylight, with much speech-making and drinking of poteen. All
> fighting was steadily avoided at a wedding; for a quarrel would be
> considered a most unlucky omen. A wet day was also held to be very
> unlucky, as the bride would assuredly weep for sorrow throughout the
> year. But the bright warm sunshine was hailed joyfully, according to
> the old saying--

>  "Happy is the bride that the sun shines on;  
> But blessed is the corpse that the rain rains on."
