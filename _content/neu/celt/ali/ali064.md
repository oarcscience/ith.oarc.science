The Dead

> There are many strange superstitions concerning the dead. The people
> seem to believe in their actual presence, though unseen, and to have a
> great fear amid dread of their fatal and mysterious power.

> If a person of doubtful character dies, too bad for heaven, too good
> for hell, they imagine that his soul is sent back to earth, and
> obliged to obey the order of some person who bids him remain in a
> particular place until the Day of Judgment, or until another soul is
> found willing to meet him there, and then they may both pass into
> heaven together, absolved.

> An incident is related that happened in the County Galway, concerning
> this superstition.

> A gentleman of rank and fortune, but of a free and dissipated life,
> became the lover of a pretty girl, one of the tenant's daughters. And
> the girl was so devoted to him that perhaps he might have married her
> at last; but he was killed suddenly, when out hunting, by a fall from
> his horse.

> Some the after, the girl, coming home late one evening, met the ghost
> of her lover, at a very lonesome part of the road. The form was the
> same as when living, but it had no eyes. The girl crossed herself, on
> which the ghost disappeared.

> Again she met the same apparition at night, and a third time, when the
> ghost stood right before her in the path, so that she could not pass.
> Then she spoke, and asked in the name of God and the good angels, why
> he appeared to her; and he answered, that he could not rest in his
> grave till he had received some command from her, which he was bound
> to obey.

> "Then," she said, "go stand by the gate in heaven till the Judgment
> Day, and look in at the blessed dead on their thrones, but you may not
> enter. This is my judgment on your soul."

> On this the ghost sighed deeply amid vanished, and was seen no more.
> But the girl prayed earnestly that she soon might meet her lover at
> the gate of heaven, whither she had sent him, that so both might enter
> together into the blessed land. And thus it happened; for by that day
> year she was carried to her grave in the churchyard, but her soul went
> forth to meet her lover, where he waited for her by the gate of heaven
> and through her love he was absolved, and permitted to enter within
> the gate before the Judgment Day.

> It was considered disrespectful to the dead to take a short cut when
> carrying the coffin to the grave.

> In the Islands, when a person is dying, they place twelve lighted
> rushes rotund the bed. This, they say, is to prevent. the devil coming
> for the soul; for nothing evil can pass a circle of fire. They also
> forbid crying for the dead until three hours have passed by, lest the
> wail of the mourners should waken the dogs who are waiting to devour
> the souls of men before they can reach the throne of God.

> It is a very general custom during some nights after a death to leave
> food outside the house--a griddle cake, or a dish of potatoes. If it
> is gone iii the morning, the spirits must have taken it; for no human
> being would touch the food left for the dead.

> The great and old families of Ireland consider it right to be buried
> with their kindred, and are brought from any distance, however remote,
> to be laid in the ancient graveyard of the race.

> A young man of family having died far away,. from fever, it was
> thought advisable not to bring him home, but to bury him where he
> died. However, on the night of the funeral a phantom hearse with four
> black horses stopped at the elm churchyard. Some men then entered with
> spades and shovels amid dug a grave, after which the hearse drove
> away. But next morning no sign of the grave was to be found, except a
> long line marked out, the Iength of a man's coffin.

> \*

> It is unlucky and a bad omen to carry fire out of a house where any
> one is ill. A gentleman one day stopped at a cabin to get a light for
> his cigar, and having wished good morning in the usual friendly
> fashion, he took a stick from the fire, blew it into a blaze, and was
> walking away, when the woman of the house rose up fiercely and told
> him it was an evil thing to take fire away when her husband was dying.
> On looking round he saw a wretched skeleton lying on a bed of straw;
> so he flung back the stick at once, and fled from the place, leaving
> his blessing in the form of a silver offering, to neutralize the evil
> of the abducted fire.

> \*

> After the priest has left a dying person, and confession has been
> made, all the family kneel rotund the bed reciting the Litany for the
> Dying, and holy water is sprinkled over the room until the soul
> departs.

> Then they all rise and begin the mournful death-wail in a loud voice;
> and by this cry all the people in the village know the exact moment of
> the death, and each one that hears it utters a prayer for the
> departing soul.

> At the wake the corpse is often dressed in the habit of a religious
> order. A cross is placed in the hands and the scapular on the breast.
> Candles are lighted all round in a circle, and the friends and
> relatives arrange themselves in due order, the nearest of kin being at
> the head. At intervals they all stand up and intone the death-wail,
> rocking back and forward over the dead, and reciting his virtues;
> while the widow amid orphans frequently salute the corpse with
> endearing epithets, and recall the happy days they spent together.

> When the coffin is borne to the grave each person present helps to
> carry it a little way; for this is considered a mode of showing honour
> to the dead. The nearest relatives take the front handles first; then
> after a little while they move to the back and others take their
> place, until every person in turn has borne the head of the coffin to
> the grave--for it would be dishonourable to the dead to omit this mark
> of respect.

> As the coffin is lowered into the grave the death-cry rises up with a
> loud and bitter wail, and the excitement often becomes so great that
> women have fallen into hysterics; and at one funeral a young girl in
> her agony of grief jumped into her father's grave and was taken up
> insensible.
