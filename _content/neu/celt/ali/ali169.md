Superstitions of the Islands

Concerning the Dead

> IT is ill luck when going with a funeral to meet a man on a white
> horse. No matter how high the rank of the rider may be, the people
> must seize the reins and force him to turn back and join he procession
> at least for a few yards.

> The three most powerful divinations are by fire, by water, and by
> clay. These are the three great powers--the power that ascends, which
> is fire; the power that falls, which is water; and the power that lies
> level on the earth, and has the mystery of the xead, which is clay,

> If a short cut should be taken while carrying a corpse to the grave
> the dead will be disturbed in the coffin, for it is a slight and an
> insult to the corpse.

> When a death was expected it was usual to have a good deal of bread
> ready baked in the house in order that the evil spirits might be
> employed eating it, and so let the soul of the dying depart in peace.
> Twelve candles stuck in clay should also be placed round the dying.

> If two funerals meet at the same churchyard, the last corpse that
> enters will have to supply the dead with water till the next corpse
> arrives.

> Never take a child in your arms after being at a wake where a corpse
> was laid out unless you first dip your hands in holy water.

> The moment the soul leaves the body the evil spirits try to seize but
> the guardian angel fights against them, and those around must pray
> earnest\]y that the angel may conquer. After death the body must not
> be disturbed, nor should the funeral chant be raised for one hour.

> There are many superstitions prevalent in the Western Islands which
> are implicitly believed and acted on. Fishermen when going to sea must
> always enter the boat by the right side, no matter how inconvenient.

> A coal of fire thrown after the fisherman brings him good fortune.

> A sick person must not be visited on a Friday, nor by any person who
> has just quitted a wake and looked upon the dead. The hair and nails
> of a sick person must not be cut till after recovery..

> If a corpse falls to the ground the most fatal events will happen to
> the family.

> The lid must not be nailed on the coffin of a new-born child, or the
> mother that bore it will never have another.
