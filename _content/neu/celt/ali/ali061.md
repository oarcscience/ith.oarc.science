Midsummer

The Baal Fires and Dances

> THIS season is still made memorable in Ireland by lighting fires on
> every hill, according to the ancient pagan usage, when the Baal fires
> were kindled as part of the ritual of sun-worship, though now they are
> lit in honour of St. John. The great bonfire of the year is still made
> on St. John's Eve, when all the people dance round it, and every young
> man takes a lighted brand from the pile to bring home with him for
> good luck to the house.

> In ancient times the sacred fire was lighted with great ceremony on
> Midsummer Eve; and on that night all the people of the adjacent
> country kept fixed watch on the western promontory of Howth, and the
> moment the first flash was seen from that spot the fact of ignition
> was announced with wild cries and cheers repeated from village to
> village, when all the local fires began to blaze, and Ireland was
> circled by a cordon of flame rising up from every hill. Then the dance
> and song began round every fire, and the wild hurrahs filled the air
> with the most frantic revelry.

> Many of these ancient customs are still continued, and the fires are
> still lighted on St. John's Eve on every hill in Ireland. When the
> fire has burned down to a red glow the young men strip to the waist
> and leap over or through the flames; this is done backwards and
> forwards several times, and he who braves the greatest blaze is
> considered the victor over the powers of evil, and is greeted with
> tremendous applause. When the fire burns still lower, the young girls
> leap the flame, and those who leap clean over three times back and
> forward will be certain of a speedy marriage and good luck in after
> life, with many children. The married women then walk through the
> lines of the burning embers; and when the fire is nearly burnt and
> trampled down, the yearling cattle are driven through the hot ashes,
> and their back is singed with a lighted hazel twig. These hazel rods
> are kept safely afterwards, being considered of immense power to drive
> the cattle to and from the watering places. As the fire diminishes the
> shouting grows fainter, and the song and the dance commence; while
> professional story-tellers narrate tales of f airy-land, or of the
> good old times long ago, when the kings and princes of Ireland dwelt
> amongst their own people, and there was food to eat and wine to drink
> for all corners to the feast at the king's house. When the crowd at
> length separate, every one carries home a brand from the fire, and
> great virtue is attached to the lighted *brone* which is safely
> carried to the house without breaking or falling to the ground. Many
> contests also arise amongst the young men; for whoever enters his
> house first with the sacred fire brings the good luck of the year with
> him.

> On the first Sunday in Midsummer all the young people used to stand in
> lines after leaving chapel, to be hired for service--the girls holding
> white hands, the young men each with an emblem of his trade. The
> evening ended with a dance and the revelry was kept up until the dawn
> of the next day, called "Sorrowful Monday," because of the end of the
> pleasure and the frolic.
