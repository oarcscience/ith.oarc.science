<BLOCKQUOTE>Take nine leaves of the male crowfoot, plucked on a Sunday night; bruise them on a stone tht never was moved since the world began, and never can be moved. Mix with salt and spittle, and apply the plaster to the ear of the sick beast. Repeat this three times for a man, and twice for a horse.</BLOCKQUOTE>
