The Bards

> THE Irish kings in ancient times kept up splendid hospitality at their
> respective courts, and never sat down to an entertainment, it was
> said, without a hundred nobles at least being present. Next in rank
> and superb living to the royal race came the learned men, the ollamhs
> and poets; they were placed next the king, and above the nobles at the
> festivals, and very gorgeous was the appearance of the Ard-Filé on
> these occasions, in his white robes clasped with golden brooches, and
> a circlet of gold upon his head; while by his side lay the golden
> harp, which he seized when the poetic frenzy came upon him, and swept
> the chords to songs of love, or in praise of immortal heroes. The
> queen alone had the privilege to ask the poet to recite at the royal
> banquets, and while he declaimed, no man dared to interrupt him by a
> single word.

> A train of fifty minor bards always attended the chief poet, and they
> were all entertained free of cost wherever they visited, throughout
> Ireland, while the Ard-Filé was borne on men's shoulders to the palace
> of the king, and there presented with a rich robe, a chain, and a
> girdle of gold. Of one bard, it is recorded that the king gave him, in
> addition, his horse and armour, fifty rings to his hand, one thousand
> ounces of pure gold, and his chess-board.

> The game of chess is frequently referred to in the old bardic tales;
> and chess seems to have been a favourite pastime with the Irish from
> the most remote antiquity. The pieces must have been of great size,
> for it is narrated that the great Cuchullen killed a messenger who had
> told him a lie, by merely flinging a chessman at him, which pierced
> his brain. The royal chess-board was very costly and richly decorated.
> One is described in a manuscript of the twelfth century: "It was a
> board of silver and pure gold, and every angle was illuminated with
> precious stones. And there was a man-bag of woven brass wire." But the
> ancestors of the same king had in their hall a chess-board with the
> pieces formed of the
>
> bones of their hereditary enemies.

> The dress of the bards added to their splendour, for the Brehon laws
> enacted that the value of the robes of the chief poet should be five
> milch cows, and that of the poetess three cows; the queen's robes
> being of the value of seven cows, including a diadem and golden veil,
> and a robe of scarlet silk, embroidered in divers colours. The scions
> of the royal house had also the right to seven colours in their
> mantle; while the poet was allowed six, and the poetess five--the
> number of colours being a sign of dignity and rank.

> Learning was always highly esteemed in Ireland, and in ancient Erin
> the *literati* ranked next to the kings.

> The great and wise *Ollamh-Fodla,* king of Ireland in Druidic times,
> built and endowed a college at Tara, near the royal Falace, which was
> called *Mur-Ollamh,* "the Wall of the Learned.' All the arts and
> sciences were represented there by eminent professors, the great
> ollaves of music, history, poetry, and oratory; and they lived and
> feasted together, and formed the great Bardic Association, ruled over
> by their own president, styled the Ard-Filé, or chief poet of Ireland,
> from *Filidecht* (philosophy or the highest wisdom); for the poets,
> above all men, were required to be pure and free from all sin that
> could be a reproach to learning. From them was demanded--

> "Purity of hand,  
> Purity of mouth,  
> Purity of learning,  
> Purity of marriage;"

> and any ollamh that did not preserve these four purities lost half his
> income and his dignity, the poet being esteemed not only the highest
> of all men for his learning and intellect, but also as being the true
> revealer of the supreme wisdom.

> Music was sedulously taught and cultivated at the college of the
> ollamhs; for all the ancient life of Ireland moved to music.

> The Brehons seated on a hill intoned the laws to the listening people;
> the Senachies chanted the genealogies of the kings; and the Poets
> recited the deeds of the heroes, or sang to their gold harps those
> exquisite airs that still enchant the world, and which have been
> wafted down along the centuries, an echo, according to tradition, of
> the soft, pathetic, fairy music, that haunted the hills and glens of
> ancient Ireland.

> The chief poet was required to know by heart four hundred poems, and
> the minor bards two hundred. And they were bound to recite any poem
> called for by the kings at the festivals. On one occasion a recitation
> was demanded of the legend of the *Taine-boCuailne,* or The Great
> Cattle Raid, of which Maeve, queen of Connaught, was the heroine, but
> none of the bards knew it. This was felt to be a great disgrace, and
> Seanchan and the bards set forth to traverse Ireland in search of the
> story of the Taine, under *Geasa,* or a solemn oath, not to sleep
> twice in the same place till it was found.

> At length it was revealed to them that only the dead Fergus-Roy knew
> the poem, and forthwith they proceeded to his grave, and fasted and
> prayed for three days, while they invoked him to appear. And on their
> invocation Fergus-Roy uprose in awful majesty, and stood in his grave
> clothes before them, and recited the Tame from beginning to end to the
> circle of listening bards. Then, having finished, he descended again
> into the grave, and the earth closed over him.

> During this expedition, Guaire the Generous took charge of all the
> wives and the poetesses of the Bardic Associat.ion, so as they should
> not trouble the bards while on their wanderings in search of the
> ballad of the Taine. Yet they do not seem to have been great feeders,
> these learned ladies; for it is related of one of them, Brigit the
> poetess, that although she only ate one hen's egg at a meal, yet she
> was called "Brigit of the great appetite."

> It was on their return from the search for the Taine that the bards
> decreed a vote of thanks to Guaire the king.

> In order to keep up the dignity of the great bardic clan, an income
> was paid by the State to each of the professors and poets according to
> his eminence; that of the chief poet being estimated by antiquarians
> at about five thousand a year of our money, for the lofty and learned
> Bardic Association disdained commerce and toil. The Fileas lived only
> on inspiration and the hospitality of their royal and noble patrons,
> which they amply repaid by laudatory odes and sonnets. But, if due
> homage were denied them, they denounced the ungenerous and niggard
> defaulter in the most scathing and bitter satires. Of one chief it is
> recorded that he absolutely went mad and died in consequence of the
> malignant poems that were made on him by a clever satirical bard.

> At last the Brehons found it necessary to take cognizance of this
> cruel and terrible implement of social torture, and enactments were
> framed against it, with strict regulations regarding the quality and
> justice of the satires poured out by the poets on those who had the
> courage to resist their exactions and resent their insolence. Finally,
> however, the ollamhs, poets, and poetesses became so intolerable that
> the reigning king of Ireland about time seventh century made a great
> effort to extirpate the whole bardic race, but failed; they were too
> strong for him, though he succeeded in, at least, materially abridging
> their privileges, lessening their revenues, and reducing their
> numbers; and though they still continued to exist as the Bardic
> Association, yet they never afterwards regained the power and dignity
> which they once held in the land, before their pride and insolent
> contempt of all classes who were not numbered amongst the ollamhs and
> fileas, had aroused such violent animosity. The Brehon laws also
> decreed, as to the distraint of a poet, that his horsewhip be taken
> from him, "as a warning that he is not to make use of it until he
> renders justice." Perhaps by the horsewhip was meant the wand or staff
> which the poets carried, made of wood, on which it is conjectured they
> may have inscribed their verses in the Ogham character.

> The Brehons seem to have made the most minute regulations as to the
> life of the people, even concerning the domestic cats. In the *Senchas
> Mor* (The Great Antiquity) it is enacted that the cat is exempt from
> liability for eating the food which he finds in the kitchen, "owing to
> negligence in taking care of it." But if it were taken from the
> security of a vessel, then the cat is in fault, and he may safely be
> killed. The cat, also, is exempt from liability for injuring an idler
> in catching mice while mousing; but *half-fines* are due from him for
> the profitable worker he may injure and the excitement of his mousing
> takes the other half. For the distraint of a dog, a stick was placed
> over his trough in order that he be not fed. And there was a distress
> of two days for a black and- white cat if descended from the great
> champion, which was taken from time ship of Breasal Breac, in which
> were white-breasted black cats; the same for the lapdog of a queen.
