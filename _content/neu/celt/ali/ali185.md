St. Kevin

> IT is related of St. Kevin that after he had been seven years at
> Glendalough, a weariness of life came over him, and a longing to bear
> the voice of man once more. Then Satan came to him in the form of an
> angel, bright and beautiful, and persuaded him that he should quit the
> valley and travel abroad and see time world, while yet his youth was
> left to him. And St. Kevin was near yielding to the words of the
> tempter, when fortunately St.. Munna came by that way, and he at once
> saw through the trick, and showed to St. Kevin that the advice was
> from the devil, and not from God. And St.. Kevin promised St. Munna
> that he would never leave the valley till his death. However, God, not
> willing that the saint should eat his heart away in idleness, bade him
> build a monastery on the east of the lake, the place where the
> resurrection was to be; and he sent his angel to show him the exact
> spot.

> But St. Kevin, when he saw the place so wild and rude, could not help
> telling the friendly angel that it was very rugged and difficult to
> build on; and the stones were heavy and hard to be moved. Then the
> angel, to prevent any difficulty in the building, rendered the stones
> light and easy to move, and so the work of building went on to the
> glory of God; and St. Kevin rejoiced in the task set before him.

> And the monk who tells the story adds, that from that day in all the
> place which the angel appointed for the building, there is now no
> stone that cannot be lightly moved and easily worked all through the
> valley of Glendalough.
