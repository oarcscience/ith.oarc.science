Whitsuntide Legend of the Fairy Horses

> There was a widow woman with one son, who had a nice farm of her own
> close to a lake, and she took great pains in the cultivation of the
> land, and her corn was the best in the whole country. But when nearly
> ripe, and just fit for cutting, she found to her dismay that every
> night it was trampled down and cruelly damaged; yet no one could tell
> by what means it was done.

> So she set her son to watch. And at midnight he heard a great noise
> and a rushing of waves on the beach, and up out of the lake came a
> great troop of horses, who began to graze the corn and trample it down
> madly with their hoofs.

> When he told all this to his mother she bade him watch the next night
> also, but to take several of the men with him furnished with bridles,
> and when the horses rose from the lake they were to fling the bridles
> over as many as they could catch.

> Now at midnight there was the same noise heard again, and the rush of
> the waves, and in an instant all the field was filled with the fairy
> horses, grazing the corn and trampling it down. The men pursued them,
> but only succeeded in capturing one, and he was the noblest of the
> lot. The rest all plunged back into the lake. However, the men brought
> home the captured horse to the widow, and he was put in the stable and
> grew big and strong, and never another horse came up out of the lake,
> nor was the corn touched after that night of his capture. But when a
> year had passed by the widow said it was a shame to keep so fine a
> horse idle, and she bade the young man, her son, take him out to the
> hunt that was held that day by all the great gentry of the country,
> for it was Whitsuntide.

> And, in truth, the horse carried him splendidly at the hunt, and every
> one admired both the fine young rider and his steed. But as he was
> returning home, when they came within sight of the lake from which the
> fairy steed had risen, he began to plunge violently, and finally threw
> his rider. And the young man's foot being unfortunately caught in the
> stirrup, he was dragged along till he was torn limb from limb, while
> the horse still continued galloping on madly to the water, leaving
> some fragment of the unhappy lad after him on the road, till they
> reached the margin of the lake, when the horse shook off the last limb
> of the dead youth from him, and plunging into the waves disappeared
> from sight.

> The people reverently gathered up the remains of the dead, and erected
> a monument of stones over the lad in a field by the edge of the lake;
> and every one that passes by still lays a stone and says a prayer that
> the spirit of the dead may rest in peace.

> The phantom horses were never seen again, but the lake has an evil
> reputation even to this day amongst the people; and no one would
> venture a boat on it after sundown at Whitsuntide, or during the time
> of the ripening of the corn, or when the harvest is ready for the
> sickle, for strange sounds are heard at night, like the wild galloping
> of a horse across the meadow, along with the cries as of a man in his
> death agony.
