The Legend of Ballytowtas Castle

> THE next tale I shall select is composed in a lighter and more modern
> spirit. All the usual elements of a fairy tale are to be found in it,
> but the story is new to the nursery folk, and, if well illustrated,
> would make a pheasant and novel addition to the rather worn-out
> legends on which thie children of many generations have been hitherto
> subsisting.

> In old times there lived where Ballytowtas Castle now stands a poor
> man named Towtas. It was in the time when manna fell to the earth with
> the dew of evening, and Towtas lived by gathering the manna, and thus
> supported himself, for he was a poor man, and had nothing else.

> One day a pedlar came by that way with a fair young daughter. "Give us
> a night's lodging," he said to Towtas, "for we are weary."

> And Towtas did so.

> Next morning, when they were going away, his heart longed for the
> young girl, and he said to the pedlar, "Give me your daughter for my
> wife."

> "How will you support her?" asked the pedlar.

> "Better than you can," answered Towtas, "for she can never want."

> Then he told him all about the manna; how he went out every morning
> when it was lying on the ground with the dew, and gathered it, as his
> father and forefathers had done before him, and lived on it all their
> lives, so that he had never known want nor any of his people.

> Then the girl showed she would like to stay with the young man, and
> the pedlar consented, and they were married, Towtas and the fair young
> maiden; and the pedlar left them and went his way. So years went on,
> and they were very happy and never wanted; and they had one son, a
> bright, handsome youth, and as clever as he was comely.

> But in due time old Towtas died, and after her husband was buried, the
> woman went out to gather the manna as she had seen him do, when the
> dew lay on the ground; but she soon grew tired and said to herself,
> "Why should I do this thing every day? I'll just gather now enough to
> do the week and then I can have rest."

> So she gathered up great heaps of it greedily, and went her way into
> the house. But the sin of greediness lay on her ever­more; and not a
> bit of manna fell with the dew that evening, nor ever again. And she
> was poor, and faint with hunger, and had to go out and work in the
> fields to earn the morsel that kept her and her son alive; and she
> begged pence from the people as they went into chapel, and this paid
> for her son's schooling; so he went on with his learning, and no one
> in the county was like him for beauty and knowledge.

> One day he heard the people talking of a great lord that lived up in
> Dublin, who had a daughter so handsome that her like was never seen;
> and all the fine young gentlemen were dying about her, but she would
> take none of them. And he came home to his mother and said, "I shall
> go see this great lord's daughter. Maybe the luck will be mine above
> all the fine young gentlemen that love her."

> "Go along, poor fool," said the mother, "how can the poor stand before
> the rich?"

> But he persisted. "If I die on the road," he said, "I'll try it.'

> "Wait, then," she answered, "till Sunday, and whatever I get I'll give
> you half of it." So she gave him half of the pence she gathered at the
> chapel door, and bid him go in the name of God. He hadn't gone far
> when he met a poor man who asked him for a trifle for God's sake. So
> he gave him something out of mother's money and went on. Again,
> another met him, and begged for a trifle to buy food, for the sake of
> God, and he gave him something also, and then went on.

> "Give me a trifle for God's sake," cried a voice, and he saw a third
> poor man before him. "I have nothing left," said Towtas, "but a few
> pence; if I give them, I shall have nothing for food and must die of
> hunger. But come with me, and whatever I can buy for this I shall
> share with you." And as they were going on to the inn he told all his
> story to the beggar man, and how he wanted to go to Dublin, but had
> now no money. So they came to the inn, and he called for a loaf and a
> drink of milk. "Cut the loaf," he said to the beggar. "You are the
> oldest."

> "I won't," said the other, for he was ashamed, but Towtas made him.

> And so the beggar cut the loaf, but though they ate, it never grew
> smaller, and though they drank as they liked of the milk, it never
> grew less. Then Towtas rose up to pay, but when the land­lady came and
> looked, "How is this?" she said. "You have eaten nothing. I'll not
> take your money, poor boy," but he made her take some; and they left
> the place, and went on their way together.

> "Now," said the beggar man, "you have been three times good to me
> to-day, for thrice I have met you, and you gave me help for thie sake
> of God each time. See, now, I can help also," and he reached a gold
> ring to the handsome youth. "Wherever you place that ring, and wish
> for it, gold will come--bright gold, so that you can never want while
> you have it."

> Then Towtas put the ring first in one pocket and then in another,
> until all his pockets were so heavy with gold that he could scarcely
> walk; but when he turned to thank the friendly beggar man, he had
> disappeared.

> So, wondering to himself at all his adventures, he went on, until he
> came at last in sight of the lord's palace, which was beautiful to
> see; but he would not enter in until he went and bought fine clothes,
> and made himself as grand as any prince; and then he went boldly up,
> and they invited him in, for they said, "Surely he is a king's son."
> And when dinner-hour came the lord's daughter linked her arm with
> Towtas, and smiled on him. And he drank of the rich wine, and was mad
> with love; but at last the wine overcame him, and the servants had to
> carry him to his bed; and in going into his room he dropped the ring
> from his finger, but knew it not.

> Now, in the morning, the lord's daughter came by, and cast her eves
> upon the door of his chamber, and there close by it was the ring she
> had seen him wear.

> Ah," she said, "I'll tease him now about his ring." And she put it in
> her box, and wished that she were as rich as a king's daughter, that
> so the king's son might marry her; and, behold, the box filled up with
> gold, so that she could not shut it; and she put it from her into
> another box, and that filled also; and then she was frightened at the
> ring, and put it at last in her pocket as the safest place.

> But when Towtas awoke and missed the ring, his heart was grieved.

> "Now, indeed," he said, "my luck is gone."

> And he inquired of all the servants, and then of the lord's daughter,
> and she laughed, by which he knew she had it; but no coaxing would get
> it from her, so when all was useless he went away, and set out again
> to reach his old home.

> And he was very mournful and threw himself down on the ferns near an
> old fort, waiting till night came on, for he feared to go home in the
> daylight lest the people should laugh at him for his folly. And about
> dusk three cats came out of the fort talking to each other.

> "How long our cook is away," said one.

> "What can have happened to him?" said another.

> And as they were grumbling a fourth cat came up.

> "What delayed you?" they all asked angrily.

> Then he told his story--how he had met Towtas and given him the ring.
> "And I just went," he said, "to the lord's palace to see how the young
> man behaved; and I was leaping over the dinner-table when the lord's
> knife struck my tail and three drops of blood fell upon his plate, but
> he never saw it and swallowed them with his meat. So now he has three
> kittens inside him and is dying of agony, and can never be cured until
> he drinks three draughts of the water of the well of Ballytowtas."

> So when young Towtas heard the cats talk he sprang up and went and
> told his mother to give him three bottles full of the water of the
> Towtas well, and he would go to the lord disguised as a doctor and
> cure him.

> So off he went to Dublin. And all the doctors in Ireland were round
> the lord, but none of them could tell what ailed him, or how to cure
> him. Then Towtas came in and said, "I will cure him." So they gave him
> entertainment and lodging, and when he 'was refreshed he gave of the
> well water three draughts to his lordship, when out jumped the three
> kittens. And there was great rejoicing, and they treated Towtas like a
> prince. But all the same he could not get the ring from the lord's
> daughter, so he set off home again quite disheartened, and thought to
> himself, "If I could only meet the man again that gave me the ring who
> knows what luck I might have?" And he sat down to rest in a wood, and
> saw there not far off three boys fighting under an oak-tree.

> "Shame on ye to fight so," he said to them. "What is the fight about?"

> Then they told him. "Our father," they said, "before he died, buried
> under this oak-tree a ring by which you can be in any place in two
> minutes if you only wish it; a goblet that is always full when
> standing, and empty only when on its side; and a harp that plays any
> tune of itself that. you name or wish for."

> "I want to divide the things," said the youngest boy, "and let us all
> go and seek our fortunes as we can."

> "But I have a right to the whole," said the eldest.

> And they went on fighting, till at length Towtas said-- "I'll tell you
> how to settle the matter. All of you be here to­morrow, and I'll think
> over the matter to-night, and I engage you will have nothing more to
> quarrel about when you come in the morning."

> So the boys promised to keep good friends till they met in thie
> morning, and went away. When Towtas saw them clear off, he dug up the
> ring, the goblet, and the harp, and now said he, "I'm all right, and
> they won't have anything to fight about in the morning."

> Off he set back again to the lord's castle with the ring, the goblet,
> and the harp; but he soon bethought himself of the powers of the ring,
> and in two minutes he was in the great hail where all the lords and
> ladies were just sitting down to dinner; and the harp played the
> sweetest music, and they all listened in delight; and he drank out of
> the goblet which was never empty, and then, when his head began to
> grow a little light, "It is enough," he said; and putting his arm
> round the waist of the lord's daughter, he took his harp and goblet in
> the other hand, and murmuring--" I wish we were at the old fort by the
> side of the wood"--in two minutes they were both at the desired spot.
> But his head was heavy with the wine, and he laid down the harp beside
> him and fell asleep. And when she saw him asleep she took the ring off
> his finger, and thie harp and the goblet from the ground and was back
> home in her father's castle before two minutes had passed by.

> When Towtas awoke and found his prize gone, and all his trea­sures
> beside, he was like one mad; and roamed about the country till he came
> by an orchard, where he saw a tree covered with bright, rosy apples.
> Being hungry and thirsty, he plucked one and ate it, but no sooner had
> he done so than horns began to sprout from his forehead, and grew
> larger and longer till he knew he looked like a goat, and all he could
> do, they would not come off. Now, indeed, he was driven out of his
> mind, and thought how all the neighbours would laugh at him; and as he
> raged and roared with shame, he spied another tree with apples, still
> brighter, of ruddy gold.

> "If I were to have fifty pairs of horns I must have one of those," he
> said; and seizing one, be had no sooner tasted it than the horns fell
> off, and he felt that he was looking stronger and handsomer than ever.

> "Now, I have her at last," he exclaimed. "I'll put horns on them all,
> and will never take them off until they give her to me as my bride
> before the whole Court."

> Without further delay he set off to the lord's palace, carrying with
> him as many of the apples as he could bring off the two trees. And
> when they saw the beauty of the fruit they longed for it; and he gave
> to them all, so that at last there was not a head to be seen without
> horns in the whole dining-hall. Then they cried out and prayed to have
> the horns taken off, but Towtas said--

> "No; there they shall be till I have the lord's daughter given to me
> for my bride, and my two rings, my goblet, and my harp all restored to
> me."

> And this was done before the face of all the lords and ladies; and his
> treasures were restored to him; and the lord placed his daughter's
> hand in the hand of Towtas, saying--"Take her; she is your wife; only
> free me from the horns." Then Towtas brought forth the golden apples;
> and they all ate, and the horns fell off; and he took his bride and
> his treasures, and carried them off home, where he built the Castle of
> Ballytowtas, in the place where stood his father's hut, and enclosed
> the well within the walls. And when he had filled his treasure-room
> with gold, so that no man could count his riches, he buried his fairy
> treasures deep in the ground, where no man knew, and no man has ever
> yet been able to find them until this day.
