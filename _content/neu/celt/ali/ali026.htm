<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Doom</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THERE was a young man of Innismore, named James Lynan, noted through all the island for his beauty and strength. Never a one could beat him at hunting or wrestling, and he was, besides, the best dancer in the whole townland. But he was bold and reckless, and ever foremost in all the wild wicked doings of the young fellows of the place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One day he happened to be in chapel after one of these mad freaks, and the priest denounced him by name from the altar.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"James Lynan," he said, "remember my words; you will come to an ill end. The vengeance of God will fall on-you for your wicked life; and by the power that is in me I denounce you as an evil liver and a limb of Satan, and accursed of all good men."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The young man turned pale, and fell on his knees before all the people, crying out bitterly, "Have mercy, have mercy; I repent, I repent," and he wept like a woman.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Go now in peace," said the priest," and strive to lead a new life, and I'll pray to God to save your soul."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>From that day forth James Lynan changed his ways. He gave up drinking, and never a drop of spirits crossed his lips. And he began to attend to his farm and his business, in place of being at all the mad revels and dances and fairs and wakes in the island. Soon after he married a nice girl, a rich farmer's daughter, from the mainland, and they had four fine children, and all things prospered with him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the priest's words never left his mind, and he would suddenly turn pale and a shivering would come over him when the memory of the curse came upon him. Still he prospered, and his life was a model of sobriety and order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One day he and his wife and their children were asked to the wedding of a friend about four miles off; and James Lynan rode to the place, the family going on their own car. At the wedding he was the life of the party as he always was; but never a drop of drink touched his lips. When evening came on, the family set out for the return home just as they had set out; the wife and children on the car, James Lynan riding his own horse. But when the wife arrived at home, she found her husband's horse standing at the gate riderless and quite still. They thought he might have fallen in a faint, and went back to search; when he was found down in a hollow not five perches from his own gate, lying quite insensible and his features distorted frightfully, as if seized while looking on some horrible vision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They carried him in, but he never spoke. A doctor was sent for, who opened a vein, but no blood came. There he lay like a log, speechless as one dead. Amongst the crowd that gathered round was an old woman accounted very wise by the people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Send for the fairy doctor," she said; "he is struck."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So they sent off a boy on the fastest horse for the fairy man. He could not come himself, but he filled a bottle with a potion. Then he said--"Ride for your life; give him some of this to drink and sprinkle his face and hands also with it. But take care as you pass the lone bush on the round hill near the hollow, for the fairies are there and will hinder you if they can, and strive to break the bottle."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then the fairy man blew into the mouth and the eyes and the nostrils of the horse, and turned him round three times on the road and rubbed the dust off his hoofs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Now go," he said to the boy; "go and never look behind you, no matter what you hear."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So the boy went like the wind, having placed the bottle safely in his pocket; and when he came to the lone bush the horse started and gave such a jump that the bottle nearly fell, but the boy caught it in time and held it safe and rode on. Then he heard a cluttering of feet behind him, as of men in pursuit; but he never turned or looked, for he knew it was the fairies who were after him. And shrill voices cried to him, "Ride fast, ride fast, for the spell is cast!" Still he never turned round, but rode on, and never let go his hold of the fairy draught till he stopped at his master's door, and handed the potion to the poor sorrowing wife. And she gave of it to the sick man to drink, and sprinkled his face and hands, after which he fell into a deep sleep. But when he woke up, though he knew every one around him, the power of speech was gone from him; and from that time to his death, which happened soon after, he never uttered word more.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So the doom of the priest was fulfilled--evil was his youth and evil was his fate, and sorrow and death found him at last, for the doom of the priest is as the word of God.</BLOCKQUOTE>
