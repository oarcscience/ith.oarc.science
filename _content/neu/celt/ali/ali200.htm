<BLOCKQUOTE>AT a holy well in the south, dedicated to St. Augustine, the friars' began to build a convent. And during all the hours of work bells' were heard ringing sweetly and voices singing; but one day a woman came and washed her feet in the water of the well, and thereupon all the bells ceased and the singing stopped, and the work could not go on. So the friars chose another site, and they drew a circle round it, within which no woman was to set her. foot; and after this the bells began to ring again and the voices. sang, and the work went on safely till the convent was completed in the name of God and St. Augustine; but no woman during all' that time ever set foot on the holy ground.</BLOCKQUOTE>
