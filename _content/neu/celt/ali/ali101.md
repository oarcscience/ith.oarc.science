The Hare

> Hares are considered unlucky, as the witches constantly assume their
> form in order to gain entrance to a field where they can bewitch the
> cattle. A man once fired at a hare he met in the early morning, and
> having wounded it, followed the track of the blood till it disappeared
> within a cabin. On entering he found Nancy Molony, the greatest witch
> in all the county, sitting by the fire*,* groaning and holding her
> side. And then the man knew that she had been out in the form of a
> hare, and he rejoiced over her discomfiture.

> Still it is not lucky to kill a hare before sunrise, even when it
> crosses your path; but should it cross *three* times, then turn back,
> for danger is on the road before you.

> A tailor one time returning home very late at night from a wake, or
> better, very early in the morning, saw a hare sitting on the path
> before him, and not inclin&1 to run away. As he approached, with his
> stick raised to strike her, he distinctly heard a voice saying, "Don't
> kill it." However, he struck the hare three times, and each time heard
> the voice say, "Don't kill it." But the last blow knocked the poor
> hare quite dead and immediately a great big weasel sat up, and began
> to spit at him. This greatly frightened the tailor who, however,
> grabbed the hare, and ran off as fast as he could. Seeing him look so
> pale and frightened, his wife asked the cause, on which he told her
> the whole story; and they both knew he had done wrong, and offended
> some powerful witch, who would be avenged. However, they dug a grave
> for the hare and buried it; for they were afraid to eat it, and
> thought that now perhaps the danger was over. But next day the man
> became suddenly speechless, and died off before the seventh day was
> over, without a word evermore passing his lips; and then all the
> neighbours knew that the witch-woman had taken her revenge.
