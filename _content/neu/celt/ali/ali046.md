The Cave Fairies

The Tuatha-de-Danann

> IT is believed by many people that the cave fairies are the remnant of
> the ancient Tuatha-de-Dananns who once ruled Ireland, but were
> conquered by the Milesians.

> These Tuatha were great necromancers, skilled in all magic, and
> excellent in all the arts as builders, poets, and musicians. At first
> the Milesians were going to destroy them utterly, but gradually were
> so fascinated and captivated by the gifts and power of the Tuatha that
> they allowed them to remain and to build forts, where they held high
> festival with music and singing and the chant of the bards. And the
> breed of horses they reared could not be surpassed in the world--fleet
> as the wind, with the arched neck and time broad chest and the
> quivering nostril, and time large eye that showed they were made of
> fire and flame, and not of dull, heavy earth. And the Tuatha made
> stables for them in the great caves of the hills, and they were shod
> with silver and had golden bridles, and never a slave was allowed to
> ride them. A splendid sight was the cavalcade of the Tuatha-de-Danann
> knights. Seven-score steeds, each with a jewel on his forehead like a
> star, and seven-score horsemen, all the sons of kings, in their green
> mantles fringed with gold, and golden helmets on their head, and
> golden greaves on their limbs, and each knight having in his hand a
> golden spear.

> And so they lived for a hundred years and more, for by their
> enchantments they could resist the power of death.
