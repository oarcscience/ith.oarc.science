Innis-Murry

> At Innis-Murry, Sligo, there is a large table-stone supported on eight
> perpendicular stones as a pedestal. And on the table are seventy-three
> stones, from five to twenty inches in circumference, which have been
> lying there from the most ancient times; for to remove them would be
> at the peril of one's life.

> On these seventy-three stones all the anathematic spirit of the island
> is concentrated. If the islanders suffer any injury, real or supposed,
> they come and turn these stones, uttering a malediction over their
> enemy, and should he be guilty he will assuredly die, or suffer some
> calamity before the year is out.

> A Scripture reader, having boldly taken away one of these stones to
> show the folly of the superstition, was obliged to restore it and to
> quit the island, or his life would not have been safe.

> There is another stone on the island where alone can fires be lighted,
> should all time domestic fires become extinct, and the spark must be
> struck from the stone itself.

> Innis-Murry is a desolate spot, rarely visited; the approach is so
> dangerous on account of the sunken rocks. The crops are scanty, and
> the soil is poor and light, growing only a short herbage of a spiral
> and sharp kind. Neither scythe nor sickle could be used in the entire
> island. Meal is unknown, and dairy produce scarcely to be had, as the
> grass can only support a few sheep; but the islanders have fish in
> abundance, crabs, lobsters, and mackerel especially.

> A traveller, who visited the island about fifty years ago, describes
> the manners and mode of living as most primitive; but the women have
> the reputation of being exceedingly virtuous, and the households are
> happy and well conducted. At that time a rude stone image was
> venerated by the people, called "Father Molosh," but supposed to be an
> ancient pagan idol, probably Moloch. The priest, however, has since
> had it destroyed.
