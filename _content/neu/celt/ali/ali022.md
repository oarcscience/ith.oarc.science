Legends of the Western Islands

> IN the islands off the West Coast of Ireland the inhabitants are still
> very primitive in their habits, and cling to their old superstitions
> with a fanatical fervour that makes it dangerous for any one to
> transgress or disregard the old customs, usages, and prejudices of the
> islanders.

> Curses heavy and deep would fall on the head of the unbelieving
> stranger who dared to laugh or mock at the old traditions of the
> ancient pagan creed, whose dogmas are still regarded with a mysterious
> awe and dread, and held sacred as a revelation from heaven.

> The chief islands are Aran and Innismore, the latter about nine miles
> long. The cattle live on the fine grass of the rocks, and turf is
> brought from the mainland. The views are magnificent of sea and
> mountain, and the islands contain a greater number of pagan and early
> Christian monuments than could be found in the same area in any other
> part. of Europe.

> Some of the *Duns* or forts include several acres. The walls are
> cyclopean, about sixteen feet thick and from eighteen to twenty feet
> high, with steps inside leading to the top. Amongst the monuments are
> cromlechs, tumuli, and pillar stones, those earliest memorials set up
> by humanity. The Irish call these huge stones *Bothal,* or house of
> God, as the hebrews called them Bethel, or God's house.

> Dun Aengus, the greatest barbaric monument of the kind in existence,
> stands on a cliff three hundred feet above the sea. It is a hundred
> and forty-two feet in diameter, and has two cyclopean walls fifteen
> feet thick and eighteen high. The sea front measures a thousand feet,
> and several acres are included within the outer wall. The roof of the
> dun is formed of large flag-stones, and the doorway slopes, after the
> Egyptian fashion, up to three feet in width at the top. A causeway of
> sharp, upright stones jammed into the ground leads to the entrance.

> This fort was the great and last stronghold of the Firbolg race, and
> they long held it as a refuge against the *Tuatha-de-Danann* invaders,
> who at that time conquered and took possession of Ireland.

> All the islands were originally peopled by the Firbolg race many
> centuries before the Christian era, and the Irish language, as still
> spoken by the people, is the purest and most ancient; of all the
> dialects of Erin. Afterwards so many Christian saints took up their
> abode there that the largest of the islands was called *Ara-na-naomh*
> (Aran of the Saints), and numerous remains of churches, cells, crosses
> and stone-roofed oratories, with the ruins of a round tower, testify
> to the long habitation of the islands by these holy men.

> There is an old wooden idol on one of the Achil islands called Father
> Molosh--probably a corruption of Moloch. In former times offerings and
> sacrifices were made to it, and it was esteemed as the guardian or god
> of the sacred fire, and held in great reverence, though but a rude
> semblance of a human head. Many miracles also were performed by the
> tooth of St. Patrick, which fell from time saint's mouth one day when
> he was teaching the alphabet to the new converts. And a shrine was
> afterwards made for the tooth that was held in the greatest honour by
> the kings, chiefs, and people of Ireland.

> The stupendous barbaric monuments of the islands, according to Irish
> antiquarians, offer the best exposition of early military architecture
> at present known, and are only equalled by some of those in Greece.
> There are also many sacred wells, and the whole region is haunted by
> strange, wild superstitions of fairies and demons and witches; legends
> filled with a weird and mystic poetry that thrill the soul like a
> strain of music from spirit voices coming to us from the far-off elder
> world. The following pathetic tale is a good specimen of these ancient
> island legends:--
