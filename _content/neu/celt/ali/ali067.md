The Power of the Word

> The belief in the malific influence of the Evil Eye pervades all the
> Greek islands, and the same preventive measures are used as in
> Ireland. An old woman is employed to spit three times at the person
> affected, if she is a person learned in the mysteries and accounted
> wise. Salt and fire are also used as safeguards, precisely as the
> Irish peasant employs them to guard his cattle and children from the
> evil influence. But no superstition is more widely spread; it seems to
> pervade all the world, and to be instinctive to humanity. The educated
> are as susceptible to it as the illiterate, and no nerves are strong
> enough, apparently, to resist the impression made by an envious,
> malicious glance, for a poison that blights and withers seems to
> emanate from it. Reason appeals in vain; the feelings cannot be
> overcome that the presence and glance of some one person in a room can
> chill all the natural flow of spirits, while the presence of another
> seems to intensify all our mental powers, and transform us for the
> moment into a higher being.

> But a malific power, stronger even than the glance of the Evil Eye,
> was exercised by the Bards of Erin: whom they would they blessed, but
> whom they would they also banned; and the poet's malison was more
> dreaded amid was more fatal than any other form of imprecation--for
> the bard had the mystic prophet power: he could foresee, and he could
> denounce. And no man could escape from the judgment pronounced by a
> poet over one he desired to injure; for the poet had the knowledge of
> all mysteries and was Lord over the secrets of life by the power of
> The Word. Therefore poets were ernphaticallv called the tribe of
> *Duars,* that is, THE MEN OF THE WORD; for by a word the poets could
> produce deformities in those they disliked, and make them objects of
> scorn and hateful in the sight of other men.
