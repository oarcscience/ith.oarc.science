<BLOCKQUOTE>"I kill the evil; I kill the worm in the flesh, the worm in the grass. I put a venomous charm in the murderous pain. The charm that was set by Peter and Paul; the charm that kills the worm in the flesh, in the tooth, in the body."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This oration to be said three times, while the patient is rubbed with butter on the place of the pain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><BLOCKQUOTE>Another.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</I><BLOCKQUOTE>A happy mild charm, a charm which Christ discovered. The charm that kills the worm in the flesh.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"May Peter take, may Paul take, may Michael take, the pain away, the cruel pain that kills the back and the life, and darkens the eyes."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This oration written, and tied to a hare's foot, is always to be worn by the person afflicted, hung round the neck.</BLOCKQUOTE>
