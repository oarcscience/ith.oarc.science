Drimial Agus Thorial

(A Wicked Spell)

> When a girl wishes to gain the love of a man, and to make him marry
> her, the dreadful spell is used called *Drimial Agus Thorial.* At dead
> of night, she and an accomplice go to a churchyard, exhume a
> newly-buried corpse, and take a strip of the skin from the head to the
> heel. This is wound round the girl as a belt with a solemn invocation
> to the devil for his help.

> After she has worn it for a day and a night she watches her
> opportunity and ties it round the sleeping man whose love she desires;
> during which process the name of God must not he mentioned.

> When he awakes the man is bound by the spell; and is forced to marry
> the cruel and evil harpy. It is said the children of such marriages
> bear a black mark round the wrist, and are known and shunned by the
> people, who call them "sons of the devil."
