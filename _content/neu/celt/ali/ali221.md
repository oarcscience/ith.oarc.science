The Skelligs of Kerry

> THE Skellig Rocks are situated about eleven miles from the mainland,
> and are considered of great sanctity. In the Middle Ages, during the
> penitential weeks of Lent, the monks. used to leave the adjacent
> convent and retire to the Skelligs Rocks for silence, prayer, and
> abstinence. Several ancient stone-roofed cells are still in existence
> at the top of the rock, showing where they dwelt. These cells are of
> the most ancient cyclopean order of building known in Ireland, and are
> far older than the church near them, which does not date earlier than
> the seventh century.

> Certainly no place more awful in its loneliness and desolation could
> be imagined than the summit of the bleak rock, reached only by a
> narrow way, almost inaccessible, even to those accustomed to climb
> precipitous paths, but which makes the ordinary traveller giddy with
> fear and dread.

> As marriages were not allowed in Lent, it became a custom for the
> young people of both sexes to make a pilgrimage to the Skellig Rocks
> during the last Lenten week. A procession was formed of the young
> girls and bachelors, and tar-barrels were lighted to guide them on the
> dangerous paths. The idea was to spend the week in prayer, penance,
> and lamentation; the girls praying for good husbands, the bachelors
> repenting of their sins. But the proceedings gradually degenerated
> into such a mad carnival of dancing, drinking, and fun, that the
> priests denounced the pilgrimage, and forbade the annual migration to
> the Skelligs. Still the practice was continued until the police had
> orders to clear the rocks. Thus ended the ancient custom of "going to
> the Skelligs: "for the mayor having pronounced judgement over the
> usage as "subversive of all morality and decorum," it was entirely
> discontinued; and the wild fun and frolic of the Skelligs is now but a
> tradition preserved in the memory of the oldest inhabitant.
