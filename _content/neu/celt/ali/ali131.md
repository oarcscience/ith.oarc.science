How to Go Invisible

> Get a raven's heart, split it open with a black-hafted knife; make
> three cuts and place a black bean in each cut. Then plant it, and when
> the beans sprout put one in your mouth and say--

> "By virtue of Satan's heart,  
> And by strength of my great art,  
> I desire to be invisible."

> And so it will be as long as the bean is kept in the mouth.
