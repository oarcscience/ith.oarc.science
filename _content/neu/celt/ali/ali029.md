Legends of Innis-Sark  
A Woman's Curse

> THERE was a woman of the Island of Innis-Sark who was determined to
> take revenge on a man because he called her by an evil name. So she
> went to the Saints' Well, and, kneeling down, she took some of the
> water and poured it on the ground in the name of the devil, saying,
> "So may my enemy be poured out like water, and lie helpless on the
> earth!" Then she went round the well backwards on her knees, and at
> each station she cast a stone in the name of the devil, and said, "So
> may the curse fall on him, and the power of the devil crush him!"
> After this she returned home.

> Now the next morning there was a stiff breeze, and some of the men
> were afraid to go out fishing; but others said they would try their
> luck, and amongst them was the man on whom the curse rested. But they
> had not gone far from land when the boat was capsized by a heavy
> squall. The fishermen, however, saved themselves by swimming to shore;
> all except the man on whom the curse rested, and he sank like lead to
> the bottom, and the waves covered him, and he was drowned.

> When the woman heard of the fate that had befallen her enemy, she ran
> to the beach and clapped her hands with joy and exulted. And as she
> stood there laughing with strange and horrid mirth, the corpse of the
> man she had cursed slowly rose up from the sea, and came drifting
> towards her till it lay almost at her very feet. On this she stooped
> down to feast her eyes on the sight of the dead man, when suddenly a
> storm of wind screamed past her, and hurled her from the point of rock
> where she stood. And when the people ran in all haste to help, no
> trace of her body could be seen. The woman and the corpse of the man
> she had cursed disappeared together under the waves, and were never
> seen again from that the forth.

> Another woman in Shark Island was considered to have an evil influence
> over any one she disliked. One day a man called her a devil's hag in
> his anger. The woman answered nothing but that night she went to a
> Holy Well near the place, and kneeling down, invoked a curse in the
> name of the devil. Then she went round the well three times backward
> on her knees, and each the threw a stone in the name of the devil,
> saying," So may the curse fall on his head!" Then she returned home,
> and told the people to wait for three days, and they would see her
> words had power. During this time the man was afraid to go out in his
> boat because of the curse. But on the third day as he was walking by
> the cliff he fell and broke his leg. And then every one knew that the
> woman had the witch-secret of evil, and she was held in much fear.

> \*

> The most effective way of neutralizing the evil influence is to spit
> on the object and say," God bless it!" But another must do it at your
> request, and sometimes people refuse, fearing to anger the fairies by
> interfering with their work, whether for good or evil. But the
> islanders have such faith in the anointing with spittle that they will
> often solicit a passing stranger to spit on the afflicted person.
> Indeed, a stranger is considered to have more power than a neighbour.

> A woman who kept a small day-school had reason to think that her son,
> a fine lad of twelve years old, was bewitched, for when he had eaten
> up the whole dish of stirabout at supper, he asked for more. And she
> said--

> "My son, you had enough for three men. Go to your bed and sleep."

> But next morning he was worse and more ravenous, for he ate up all the
> bread that his mother had made for the scholars just as she took it
> from the oven, and not a single cake was left. Then she knew that
> witchcraft was on the boy, and she stood by the door to watch for a
> stranger. At last one came by, and she cried to him--

> "Come in, come in, for the love of God, and spit on the face of my
> son!"

> "Why should I spit on your son, O woman?" he answered; and he fled
> away, for he thought she was mad.

> Then she sent for the priest, and his reverence poured holy water over
> him, and laid his hands upon his head while he prayed. So, after a
> time, the power of the witchcraft was broken, and the boy was restored
> to his right mind.

> \*

> The islanders believe also that angels are constantly present amongst
> them, and all blessed things--the rain, and the dew, and the green
> crops--come from their power; but the fairies often bring sickness,
> and will do malicious tricks, and lame a horse, or steal the milk and
> butter, if they have been offended or deprived of their rights.

> There are certain days on which it is not right to speak of the
> fairies. These days are Wednesdays and Fridays, for then they are
> present though invisible, and can hear everything, and lay their plans
> as to what they will carry off. On Friday especially their power for
> evil is very strong, and misfortunes are dreaded in the household.
> Therefore, on that day the children and cattle are strictly watched; a
> lighted wisp of straw is turned round the baby's head, and a quenched
> coal is set under the cradle and under the churn. And if the horses
> are restive in the stable, then the people know the fairies are riding
> on their backs. So they spit three times at the animal, when the
> fairies scamper off. This cure by the saliva is the most ancient of
> all superstitions, and the islanders still have the greatest faith in
> its mysterious power and efficacy.

> \*

> At Innisboffin the fairies hold a splendid court, with revelry and
> dancing, when the moon is full; and it is very dangerous for young
> girls to be out at that the, for they will assuredly be carried off.
> And if they once hear the fairy music or drink of the fairy wine, they
> will never be the same again--a fate is on them, and before the year
> is out they will either disappear or die.

> And the fairies are always on the watch for the handsome girls or
> children; for they look on mortals as of much higher race than
> themselves. And they are also glad to have the fine young men, the
> sons of mortal women, to assist them in their wars with each other;
> for there are two parties amongst the fairy spirits, one a gentle race
> that loves music and dancing, the other that has obtained power from
> the devil, and is always trying to work evil.

> A young man lay down to sleep one Friday evening in summer under a
> hay-rick, and the fairies must have carried him off as he slept; for
> when he woke he found himself in a great hall, where a number of
> little men were at work--some spinning, some making shoes, some making
> spears and arrow-heads out of fish-bones and elf-stones; but all busy
> laughing and singing with much glee and merriment, while the little
> pipers played the merriest tunes.

> Then an old man who sat in the corner came over, and looking very
> angry, told him he must not sit there idle; there were friends coming
> to dinner, and he must go down and help in the kitchen. So he drove
> the poor young fellow before him down into a great vaulted place,
> where a huge fire was burning, and a large pot was set over it.

> "Now," said the old man, "prepare the dinner. There is the old hag we
> are going to eat."

> And true enough, to his horror, on looking round, there was an old
> woman hung up by the arms, and an old man skinning her.

> "Now make haste and let the water boil," said the old man: "don't you
> see the pot on the fire, and I am nearly ready for you to begin. The
> company will soon be here, and there is no time to lose, for this old
> hag will take a good while to boil. Cut her up into little bits, and
> throw her into the pot."

> However, the young fellow was so frightened that he fell down on the
> floor speechless, and could neither move hand nor foot.

> "Get up, you fool," said another old man, who seemed to be the head
> over all; and he laughed at him. "Do your work and never mind; this
> does not hurt her a bit. When she was there above in the world she was
> a wicked miser, hard to the world, and cruel and bitter in her words
> and works; so now we have her here, and her soul will never rest in
> peace, because we shall cut up the body in little bits, and the soul
> will not be able to find it, but wander about in the dark to all
> eternity without a body."

> Then the young man knew no more till he found himself in a beautiful
> hall, where a banquet was laid out; but, in place of the old hag, the
> table was covered with fruit, and chickens, and young turkeys, and
> butter, and cakes fresh from the oven, and crystal cups of bright red
> wine.

> "Now sit down and eat," said the prince, who sat at the top on a
> throne, with a red sash round his waist, and a gold band on his head.
> "Sit down with this pleasant company and eat with us; you are
> welcome."

> And there were many beautiful ladies seated round, and grand noblemen,
> with red caps and sashes; and they all smiled at him and bade him eat.

> "No," said the young man; "I cannot eat with you, for I see no priest
> here to bless the food. Let me go in peace."

> "Not at least till you taste our wine," said the prince with a
> friendly smile.

> And one of the beautiful ladies rose up and filled a crystal cup with
> the bright red wine, and gave it him. And when he saw it, the sight of
> it tempted him, and he could not help himself, but drank it all off
> without stopping; for it seemed to him the most delicious draught he
> ever had in his whole life.

> But no sooner had he laid down the glass, than a noise like thunder
> shook the building, and all the lights went out; and he found himself
> alone in the dark night lying under the very same hay-rick where he
> had cast himself down to sleep, tired after his work. So he made his
> way home at last; but the taste of the fairy wine burned in his veins,
> and a fever was on him night and day for another draught; and he did
> no good, but pined away, seeking the fairy mansion, though he never
> found it any more. And so he died in his youth, a warning to all who
> eat of the fairy food, or drink of the fairy wine; for never more will
> they know peace or content, or be fit for their work, as in the days
> before the fairy spell was on them, which brings doom and death to all
> who fall under the fatal enchantment of its unholy power.
