The Dead Soldier

> THERE is an island in the Shannon, and if a mermaid is seen sitting on
> the rocks in the sunshine, time people know that a crime has been
> committed somewhere near; for she never appears but to announce
> ill-luck, and she has a spite against mortals, and rejoices at their
> misfortunes.

> One day a young fisherman was drawn by the current towards the island,
> and he came on a long streak of red blood, and had to sail his boat
> through it till he reached the rocks where the mermaid was seated; and
> then the boat went round and round as in a whirlpool, and sank down at
> last under the waves.

> Still he did not lose consciousness. He looked round and saw that he
> was in a beautiful country, with tall plants growing all over it; and
> the mermaid came and sang sweetly to him, and offered him wine to
> drink, but he would not taste it, for it was red like blood. Then he
> looked down, and to his horror he saw a soldier lying on time floor
> with his throat cut; and all round him was a pool of blood, and he
> remembered no more till he found himself again in his boat drifting
> against a hurricane, and suddenly he was dashed upon a rock, where his
> friends who were in search of him found him, and carried him home,
> There he heard a strange thing: a soldier, a deserter from the Athlone
> Barracks, being pursued had cut his throat and flung himself over the
> bridge into the river; and this was the very man the young fisher had
> seen lying a corpse in the mermaid's cave. After this he had no peace
> or comfort till he went to the priest, who exorcised him and gave him
> absolution; and then the wicked siren of the rocks troubled him no
> more, though she still haunts the islands of the Shannon and tries to
> lure victims to their death.
