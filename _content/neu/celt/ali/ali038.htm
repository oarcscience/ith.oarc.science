<BLOCKQUOTE>THERE is an old ruin called Bruce's Castle on this island, and the legend runs that Bruce and his chief warriors lie in an enchanted sleep in a cave of this rock on which stands the castle, and that one day they will rise up and unite the island to Scotland.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The entrance to this cave is visible only once in seven years. A man who happened to be travelling by at the time discovered it, and entering in he found himself all at once in the midst of the heavy-handed warriors, he looked down and saw a sabre half unsheathed in the earth at his feet, and on his attempting to draw it every man of time sleepers lifted up his head and put his hand on his sword. The man being much alarmed fled from the cave, but he heard voices calling fiercely after him: "Ugh! ugh! Why could we not be left to sleep?" And they clanged their swords on the ground with a terrible noise, and then all was still, and the gate of the cave closed with a mighty sound like a clap of thunder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
