The Dead Hand

> WITCHCRAFT is sometimes practised by the people to produce butter in
> the churn, the most efficacious being to stir the milk round with the
> hand of a dead man, newly taken from the churchyard; but whoever is
> suspected of this practice is looked upon with great horror and dread
> by the neighbours.

> A woman of the mainland got married to a fine young fellow of one of
> the islands. She was a tall, dark woman who seldom spoke, and kept
> herself very close and reserved from every one. But she minded her
> business; for she had always more butter to bring to market than any
> one else, and could therefore undersell the other farmers' wives. Then
> strange rumours got about concerning her, and the people began to
> whisper among themselves that something was wrong, and that there was
> witchcraft in it, especially as it was known that whenever she churned
> she went into an inner room off the kitchen, shut the door close, and
> would allow no one to enter. So they determined to watch and find out
> the secret, and one day a girl from the neighbourhood, when the woman
> was out, got in through a window and hid herself under the bed,
> waiting there patiently till the churning began.

> At last in came the woman, and having carefully closed the door began
> her work with the milk, churning in the usual way without any strange
> doings that might seem to have magic in them. But presently she
> stopped, and going over to a box unlocked it, and from this
> receptacle, to the girl's horror, she drew forth the hand of a dead
> man, with which she stirred the milk round and round several times,
> going down on her knees and muttering an incantation all the while.

> Seven times she stirred the milk with the dead hand, and seven times
> she went round the churn on her knees muttering some strange charm.
> After this she rose up and began to gather the butter from the churn
> with the dead hand, filling a pail with as

> much butter as the milk of ten cows. When the pail was quite full she
> dipped the dead hand three times in the milk, then dried it and put it
> back again in the box.

> The girl, as soon as she could get away unperceived, fled in horror
> from the room, and spread the news amongst the people. At once a crowd
> gathered round the house with angry cries and threats to break open
> the door to search for the dead hand.

> At last the woman appeared calm and cold as usual, and told them they
> were taking a deal of trouble about nothing, for there was no dead
> hand in the house. However, the people rushed in and searched, but all
> they saw was a huge fire on the hearth, though the smell of burning
> flesh was distinctly perceptible, and by this they knew that she had
> burnt the dead hand. Yet this did not save her from the vengeance of
> the neighbours. She was shunned by every one; no one would eat with
> her, or drink with her, or talk to her, and after a while she and her
> husband quitted the island and were never more heard of.

> However, after she left and the butter was brought to the market, all
> the people had their fair and equal rights again, of which the wicked
> witchcraft of the woman had defrauded them for so long, and there was
> great rejoicing in the island over the fall and punishment of the
> wicked witch of the dead hand.
