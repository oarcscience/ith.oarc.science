Medical Superstitions and Ancient Charms

> THE healing art in all the early stages of a nation's life, and
> amongst all primitive tribes, has been associated with religion. For
> the wonderful effects produced by certain herbs and modes, of
> treatment were believed by the simple and unlettered people to be due
> to supernatural influence acting in a mystic and magical manner on the
> person afflicted.

> The medicine men were therefore treated with the profoundest awe and
> respect. And the medicine women came in also for their share of
> veneration and often of superstitious dread; for their mysterious
> incantations were supposed to have been taught to them by fairies and
> the spirits of the mountain.

> The Irish from the most remote antiquity were devoted to mystical
> medicine, and had a remarkable knowledge of cures and remedies for
> disease, obtained through the power and action of herbs on the human
> frame.

> The physicians of the pagan era formed a branch of the Druid
> priesthood, and were treated with distinguished honour. They had
> special places assigned to them at the royal banqueting table at Tara,
> and a certain revenue was secured to them that they might live
> honourably.

> When in attendance on a patient the doctor was entitled by law to his
> diet, along with four of his pupils; but if he failed to cure from
> deficiency of skill, he was obliged to refund the fees and pay back
> all the expenses of his keep; a measure which no doubt greatly
> stimulated the serious attention of the learned ollamhs of healing to
> the case in hand.

> So great, indeed, was the importance attached to the healing art in
> Ireland, that even prior to the Christian era, a building of the
> nature of an hospital was erected at Tara, near to the palace of the
> king. This was called "The House of Sorrow," and this sick and wounded
> were provided there with all necessary care.

> On one occasion it is recorded that a great chief and prince out of
> Munster was brought to "The House of Sorrow" to be treated of wounds
> received in battle, but the attendant, through treachery, placed
> poison in the wounds, and then closed them so carefully that there was
> no external sign, though the groans of the wounded man were terrible
> to hear. Then the learned Fioneen was sent for, "this prophetic
> physician," as he was called, from his great skill in diagnosis; and
> when he arrived with three of his pupils at the hospital they found
> the chief lying prostrate, groaning in horrible agony.

> "What groan is that?" asked the master of the first pupil.

> "It is from a poisoned barb," he answered.

> "And what groan is that?" asked the master, of the second pupil.

> "It is from a hidden reptile," he answered.

> "And what groan is that?" asked Fioneen of the third pupil.

> "It is from a poisoned seed," he answered.

> Then Fioneen set to work, and having cauterized the wounds with red
> hot irons, the poisonous bodies were extracted from beneath the skin,
> and the chief was healed.

> In later times the Irish physicians were much celebrated for their
> learning, and numerous Irish medical manuscripts are in existence,
> both in Ireland and England, and are also scattered through the public
> libraries of the continent. They are chiefly written in Latin, with a
> commentary in Irish, and show a thorough knowledge on the part of the
> writers of the works of Hippocrates, Galen, Aristotle, and others as
> celebrated. For after the introduction of Christianity Latin was much
> cultivated in the Irish schools, and the priests and physicians not
> only wrote, but could converse fluently in Latin, which language
> became the chief medium of communication between them and the learned
> men of the continent. But the most ancient mode of procedure amongst
> the Irish ollamhs and adepts was of a medico-religious character;
> consisting of herb cures, fairy cures, charms, invocations, and
> certain magical ceremonies. A number of these cures have been
> preserved traditionally by the people, and form a very interesting
> study of early medical superstitions, as they have been handed down
> through successive generations; for the profession of a physician was
> hereditary in certain families, and the accumulated lore of centuries
> was transmitted carefully from father to son by this custom and usage.

> Many of the ancient cures and charms are strange and mystic, and were
> accompanied by singular mysterious forms, which no doubt in many cases
> aided the cure; especially amongst a people so imaginative and
> susceptible to spiritual influences as the Irish. Others show a
> fervent faith and have a pathetic simplicity of expression, such as we
> find in "The Charm against Sorrow," and others, from the original
> Irish, of equal pathos and tenderness, to be quoted further on. The
> utterance evidently of a people of deep, almost sublime, faith in the
> Divine power of the Ruler of the world, and of the ever-present
> ministration of saints and angels to humanity.

> Every act of the Irish peasant's life has always been connected with
> this belief in unseen spiritual agencies. The people live in an
> atmosphere of the supernatural, and nothing would induce them to
> slight an ancient form or break through a traditional usage. They
> believe that the result would be something awful; too terrible to be
> spoken of save in a whisper, should the customs of their forefathers
> be lightly interfered with.

> In the Western Islands especially, the old superstitions that have
> come down from the ancient times are observed with this most solemn
> reverence, and the people in fact, as to their habits and ideas,
> remain much the same as bi. Patrick left them fourteen hundred years
> ago. The swift currents of thought that stir the great centres of
> civilization and impel the human intellect on its path of progress,
> have never reached them; all the waves of the centuries drift by their
> shores and leave them unchanged.

> It is therefore in the islands and along the western coast that one
> gathers most of those strange legends, charms, mysteries, and
> world-old superstitions which have lingered longer in Ireland than in
> any other part of Europe.

> Many of those included in this following selection were narrated by
> the peasants, either in Irish, or in the expressive Irish-English,
> which still retains enough of the ancient idiom to make the language
> impressively touching and picturesque. The ancient charms which have
> come down by tradition from a remote antiquity are peculiarly
> interesting from their deep human pathos, blended with the sublime
> trust in the Divine invisible power, so characteristic of the Irish
> temperament in all ages. A faith that believes implicitly, trusts
> devoutly, and hopes infinitely; when the soul in its sorrow turns to
> heaven for the aid which cannot be found on earth, or given by earthly
> hands. The following charms from the Irish express much of this
> mingled spirit of faith and hope:--
