<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Royal Steed</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Of the great breed of splendid horses, some remained for several centuries, and were at once known by their noble shape and qualities. The last of them belonged to a great lord in Connaught, and when he died, all his effects being sold by auction, the royal steed came to the hammer, and was bought up by an emissary of the English Government, who wanted to get possession of a specimen of the magnificent ancient Irish breed, in order to have it transported to England.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But when the groom attempted to mount the high-spirited animal, it reared, and threw the base-born churl violently to the ground, killing him on the spot.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then, fleet as time wind, the horse galloped away, and finally plunged into the lake and was seen no more. So ended the great race of the mighty Tuatha-de-Danann horses in Ireland, the like of which has never been seen since in all the world for majesty and beauty.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Sometimes the cave fairies make a straight path in the sea from one island to another, all paved with coral, under the water; but no one can tread it except time fairy race. Fishermen coming home late at night, on looking down, have frequently seen them passing and re-passing--a black band of little men with black dogs, who are very fierce if any one tries to touch them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There was an old man named Con, who lived on an island all alone, except for a black dog who kept him company. Now all the people knew right well that he was a fairy king, and could walk the water at night like the other fairies. So they feared him greatly, and brought him presents of cakes and fowls, for they were afraid of him and of his evil demon, the dog. For often, men coming home late have heard the steps of this dog and his breathing quite close to them, though they could not see him; and one man nearly died of fright, and was only saved by the priest who came and prayed over him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>*</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the cave fairies can assume many forms.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One summer's evening, a young girl, the daughter of the man who owned the farm, was milking time cows in the yard, when three beautiful ladies, all in white, suddenly appeared, and asked her for a drink of milk. Now time girl knew well that milk should not be given away without using some precaution against fairy wiles, so she hesitated, fearing to bring ill-luck on the cows.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Is that time way you treat us?" said one of the ladies, and she slapped the girl on the face.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"But you'll remember us," said the second lady, and she took hold of the girl's thumb and twisted it out of joint.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And your lover will be false to you," said the third, and with that she turned the girl's mantle crooked, the back to the front.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then the first lady took a vessel and milked the cow, and they all drank of the milk as much as they wanted; after which they turned to the girl and bade her beware of again offending the spirits of the cave, for they were very powerful, and would not let her off so easily another time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The poor girl fainted from fright, and was found quite senseless when they came to look for her; but the white ladies had disappeared. Though the story must have been true, just as she told it when she came to her senses, for not a drop of milk was left in the pail, nor could a drop more be got from the cows all that evening.</BLOCKQUOTE>
