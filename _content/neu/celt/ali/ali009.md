The Fairy Dance

> THE following story is from the Irish, as told by a native of one of
> the Western Isles, where the primitive superstitions have still all
> the freshness of young life.

> One evening late in November, which is the month when spirits have
> most power over all things, as the prettiest girl in all the island
> was going to the well for water, her foot slipped and she fell, it was
> an unlucky omen, and when she got up and looked round it seemed to her
> as if she were in a strange place, and all around her was changed as
> if by enchantment. But at some distance she saw a great crowd gathered
> round a blazing fire, and she was drawn slowly on towards them, till
> at last she stood in the very midst of the people; but they kept
> silence, looking fixedly at her; and she was afraid, and tried to turn
> and leave them, but she could not. Then a beautiful youth, like a
> prince, with a red sash, and a golden band on his long yellow hair,
> came up and asked her to dance.

> "It is a foolish thing of you, sir, to ask me to dance," she said,
> "when there is no music."

> Then he lifted his hand and made a sign to the people, and instantly
> the sweetest music sounded near her and around her, and the young man
> took her hand, and they danced and danced till the moon and the stars
> went down, but she seemed like one floating on the air, and she forgot
> everything in the world except the dancing, and the sweet low music,
> and her beautiful partner.

> At last the dancing ceased, and her partner thanked her, and invited
> her to supper with the company. Then she saw an opening in the ground,
> and a flight of steps, and the young man, who seemed to be the king
> amongst them all, led her down, followed by the whole company. At the
> end of the stairs they came upon a large hall, all bright and
> beautiful with gold and silver and lights; and the table was covered
> with everything good to eat, and wine was poured out in golden cups
> for them to drink. When she sat down they all pressed her to eat the
> food and to drink the wine; and as she was weary after the dancing,
> she took the golden cup the prince handed to her, and raised it to her
> lips to drink. Just then, a man passed close to her, and whispered--

> "Eat no food, and drink no wine, or you will never reach your home
> again."

> So she laid down the cup, and refused to drink. On this they were
> angry, and a great noise arose, and a fierce, dark man stood up, and
> said--

> "Whoever comes to us must drink with us."

> And he seized her arm, and held the wine to her lips, so that she
> almost died of fright. But at that moment a red-haired man came up,
> and he took her by the hand and led her out.

> "You are safe for this time," he said. "Take this herb, and hold it in
> your hand till you reach home, and no one can harm you." And he gave
> her a branch of a plant called the *Athair-Luss* (the ground ivy).
> \[a\]

> This she took, and fled away along the sward in the dark night; but
> all the time she heard footsteps behind her in pursuit. At last she
> reached home and barred the door, and went to bed, when a great
> clamour arose outside, and voices were heard crying to her--

> "The power we had over you is gone through the magic of the herb; but
> wait--when you dance again to the music on the hill, you will stay
> with us for evermore, and none shall hinder."

> However, she kept the magic branch safely, and the fairies never
> troubled her more; but it was long and long before the sound of the
> fairy music left her ears which she had danced to that November night
> on the hillside with her fairy lover.

>  

> \[a\] In Ancient Egypt the ivy was sacred to Osiris, and a safeguard
> against evil.
