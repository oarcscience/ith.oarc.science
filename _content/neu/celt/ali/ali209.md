The Irish Fakir

> MANY of the professional prayer-men, or Fakirs, resort to the
> *Tober-Breda* during the pattern, and manage to obtain gifts and
> contributions and all sorts of excellent things in exchange for their
> prayers from the rich farmers and young girls, to whom they promise
> good luck, and perhaps also a lover who will be handsome and young.

> These Irish Fakirs, or sacred fraternity of beggars, lead a pleasant,
> thoroughly idle life. They carry a wallet and a staff, and being
> looked on as holy men endowed with strange spiritual gifts, they are
> entirely supported by the voluntary gifts of the people, who firmly
> believe in the mysterious efficacy of their prayers and blessings and
> prognostics of luck.

> One of these Fakirs towards the end of his life was glad to find
> shelter in the poor-house. He was then eighty years of age, but a
> tall, erect old man, with flowing white beard and hair, keen eyes, and
> of the most venerable aspect.

> A gentleman who saw him there, being much struck with his dignified
> and remarkable appearance, induced him to tell the story of his life,
> which was marked by several strange and curious incidents.

> He said he was a farmer's son, but from his earliest youth hated work,
> and only liked to spend the long summer day lying on the grass gazing
> up into the clouds dreaming and thinking where they were all sailing
> to, and longing to float away with them to other lands.

> Meanwhile his father raged and swore and beat him, often cruelly,
> because he would not work. But all the same, he could not bring
> himself to be digging from morning to night and herding cattle, and
> keeping company only with labourers.

> So when he was about twenty he formed a plan to run away; for, he
> thought, if the stupid old Fakirs who are lame and blind and deaf find
> people ready to support them, all for nothing, might not he have a
> better chance for getting board and lodging without work, since he had
> youth and health and could tell them stories to no end of the great
> old ancient times.

> So one night he quitted his father's house secretly, and went forth on
> his travels into the wide world, only to meet bitter disappointment
> and rude repulse, for the farmers would have nothing to say to him,
> nor the farmers' wives. Every one eyed him with suspicion. "Why," they
> said, "should a great stalwart young fellow over six feet high go
> about the country begging? He was a tramp and meant no good." And they
> chased him away from their grounds.

> Then he thought he would disguise himself as a regular Fakir; so he
> got a long cloak, and took a wallet and a staff, and hid his raven
> black hair under a close skull cap, and tried to look as old as he
> could.

> But the regular Fakirs soon found him out, and their spite and rage
> was great, for all of them were either lame of a leg or blind of an
> eye, and they said; "Why should this great broad-shouldered young
> fellow with the black eyes come and take away our chances of living,
> when he ought to be able to work and earn enough to keep himself
> without robbing us of our just rights?" And they grumbled and snarled
> at him like so many dogs, and set people to spy on him and watch him.

> Still he was determined to try his luck on every side: so he went to
> all the stations round about and prayed louder and faster than any
> pilgrim or Fakir amongst the whole lot.

> But wherever he went he saw a horrible old hag for ever following him.
> Her head was wrapped up in an old red shawl, and nothing was seen of
> her face except two eyes, that glared on him like coals of fire
> whichever way he turned. And now, in truth, his life became miserable
> to him because of this loathsome hag. So he went from station to
> station to escape her; but still she followed him, and the sound of
> her stick on the ground was ever after him like the hammering of a
> nail into his coffin, for he felt sure he would die of the torment and
> horror.

> At last he thought he would try *Tobar-Breda* for his next station, as
> it was several miles off and she might not be able to follow him so
> far. So he went, and not a sign of her was to be seen upon the road.
> This rejoiced his heart, and he kneeled down at the well and was
> saying his prayers louder and faster than ever when he looked up, and
> there, kneeling right opposite to him at the other side of the road,
> was the detestable old witch. But she took no notice of him, only went
> on saying her prayers and telling her beads as if no one were by.

> Presently, however, she stooped down to wash her face in the well,
> and, as she threw up the water with her hands, she let the red shawl
> slip down over her shoulders, and then the young man beheld to his
> astonishment a beautiful young girl before him with a complexion like
> the lily and the rose, and soft brown hair falling in showers of curls
> over her snow-white neck.

> He had only a glimpse for a moment while she cast the water in her
> face, and then she drew the red shawl again over her head and
> shoulders and was the old hag once more that had filled him with
> horror. But that one glimpse was enough to make his heart faint with
> love; and now for the first time she turned her burning eyes full on
> him, and kept them fixed until he seemed to swoon away in an ecstacy
> of happiness, and knew nothing more till he found her seated beside
> him, holding his hand in hers, and still looking intently on his face
> with her glittering eyes.

> "Come away," she whispered; "follow me. We must leave thus crowd of
> pilgrims. I have much to say to you."

> So he rose up, amid they went away together to a secluded spot, far
> from the noise and tumult of the station. Then she threw off the
> shawl, and took the bandage from her face, and said, "Look on me. Can
> you love me? I have followed you day by day for love of you. Can you
> love me in return, and join your fate to mine? I have money enough for
> both, and I'll teach you the mysteries by which we can gain more."

> And from that day forth they two travelled together all over the
> country; and they practised many strange mysteries and charms, for
> Elaine, his wife, was learned in all the secrets of herb lore. And the
> people paid them well for their help and knowledge, so that they never
> wanted anything, and lived like princes, though never an evil act was
> done by their hands, nor did a word of strife ever pass between them.

> Thus they lived happily for many years, till an evil day came when
> Elaine was struck by sickness, and she died.

> Then the soul of the man seemed to die with her, and all his knowledge
> left him, and sad and weary, and tired of all things he finally came
> to end his days in the poor-house, old, poor, and broken-hearted. Yet
> still he had the bearing of one born for a higher destiny, and the
> noble dignity as of a discrowned king.

> Such was the strange story told to the gentleman by the aged Fakir in
> the poor-house, a short time before his death.
