The Cuckoo and Robin Redbreast

> It is very unlucky to kill the cuckoo or break its eggs, for it brings
> fine weather; but most unlucky of all things is to kill the robin
> redbreast. The robin is God's own bird, sacred and holy, and held in
> the greatest veneration because of the beautiful tradition current
> amongst the people, that it was the robin plucked out the sharpest
> thorn that was piercing Christ's brow on the cross; and in so doing
> the breast of the bird was dyed red with the Saviour's blood, and so
> has remained ever since a sacred and blessed sign to preserve the
> robin from harm and make it beloved of all men.
