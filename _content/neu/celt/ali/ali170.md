The Coastguard's Fate

> One day a coastguard man was out in his boat with some of the
> islanders when a terrible storm arose with thunder and lightning. The
> poor people fell on their knees and prayed devoutly, but the man
> laughed at them, called them fools and cowards, and said be also could
> make lightning and thunder as well as the God they were praying to. So
> he immediately prepared a small cannon he had on board, and set a
> match to the powder and fired it off*.* But before the echo died away
> a stream of lightning passed over him, and he fell dead in the boat a
> blackened corpse--a dreadful sign of the vengeance of heaven on his
> blasphemous daring.
