The Poet's Malediction

> The imprecations of the poets had often also a mysterious and fatal
> effect.

> King Breas, the pagan monarch, was a fierce, cruel, and niggardly man,
> who was therefore very unpopular with the people, who hate the cold
> heart and the grudging hand.

> Amongst others who suffered by the king's inhospitality, was the
> renowned Carbury the poet, son of Eodain, the great poetess of the
> Tuatha-de-Danann race; she who chanted the song of victory when her
> people conquered the Firbolgs, on the plains of Moytura; and the stone
> that she stood on, during the battle, in sight of all the warriors, is
> still existing, and is pointed out as the stone of Eodain the poetess,
> with great reverence, even to this day.

> It was her son, Carburv the poet, who was held in such high honour by
> the nation, that King Breas invited him to his court, in order that he
> might pronounce a powerful malediction over the enemy with whom he was
> then at war.

> Carbury came on the royal summons, but. in place of being treated with
> the distinction due to his high rank, he was lodged and fed so meanly
> that the soul of the poet raged with wrath for the king gave him for
> lodgement only a small stone cell with-out fire or a bed; and for food
> he had only three cakes of meal without any flesh meat or sauce, and
> no wine was given him, such wine as is fit to light up the poet's soul
> before the divine mystic spirit of song can awake in its power within
> him. So very early the next morning, the poet rose up and departed,
> with much rage in his heart. But as he passed the king's house he
> stopped, and in place of a blessing, pronounced a terrible malediction
> over Breas and his race, which can still be found in the ancient books
> of Ireland, commencing thus--

> "Without fire, without bed, on the surface of the floor!  
> Without meat, without fowl, on the surface of the dish.  
> Three little dishes and no flesh thereon,  
> A cell without bed, a dish without meat, a cup without wine,  
> Are these fit offerings from a king to a poet?  
> May the king and his race be three times accursed for ever and for
> ever!"

> Immediately three large blisters rose on the king's forehead, and
> remained there as a sign and mark of the poet's vengeance.

> And from that day forth to his death, which happened not long after,
> the reign of Breas was a time of sore trouble and disaster, for he was
> three times defeated by his enemies, and from care and sorrow a
> grievous disease fell on him; for though hungry he could not swallow
> any food; and though all the meat and wine of the best was set before
> him, yet his throat seemed closed, and though raging with hunger yet
> not a morsel could pass his lips; and so he died miserably, starved in
> the midst of plenty, and accursed in all things by the power and
> malediction of the angry poet.
