Tober-na-Dara

> Tober-na-Dara (the well of tear's) was so called because it overflowed
> one time for a mile round, from the tears of the Irish wives and
> mothers who came there to weep for their fallen kindred, who had been
> slain in a battle, fighting against Cromwell's troopers of the English
> army.
