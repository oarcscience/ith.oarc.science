Alectromantia

> Should a person be bewitched by an evil neighbour, he must take two
> black cocks, lay a charm over the head of one and let it loose; but
> the other must be boiled down, feathers and all, and eaten. Then the
> malice of the neighbour will have no effect on him or his.

> Ancient Egypt and Greece had likewise superstitions on the subject of
> sacrificing a cock. Even the last words of Socrates had reference to
> this subject. It is remarkable also that in the Christian legend it
> was a cock that testified indignantly by his crowing against Peter's
> treachery and cowardice, and aroused in him the remorse that was
> evidenced by his tears.
