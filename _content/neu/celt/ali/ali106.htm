<BLOCKQUOTE>Ten leaves of the hemlock dried and powdered and mixed in food or drink will make the person you like to love you in return.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Also keep a sprig of mint in your hand till the herb grows moist and warm, then take hold of the hand of the woman you love, and she will follow you as long as the two hands close over the herb. No invocation is necessary; but silence must be kept between this two parties for ten minutes, to give the charm time to work with due efficacy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
