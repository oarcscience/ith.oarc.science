The Ancient Race

> BUT thousands of years ago, long before kings, bards, and Druids, with
> all their learning and comparative civilization, flourished in
> Ireland, and before the traditions of a beautiful fairy race were
> brought from the far East by a people accustomed to the sight of
> beauty, grace and splendour, an ancient race existed in the world--a
> mysterious, primitive wave of human life that spread over all Europe,
> perhaps over all the earth, and even surged upon the shores of our own
> Western island; possibly a pre-Adamic race, inferior in all points,
> physical as well as mental, to the Adamic race that succeeded them.

> They have left no name or history, yet evidences of their nature,
> habits, intellect, and modes of life can be scientifically deduced
> from the abundant strange and curious antiquarian remains to be seen
> in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, of which Sir William Wilde
> in his illustrated catalogue has given such a perfect and
> comprehensive description. Records of a period so remote that the use
> of metals even was unknown; yet these ancient records reveal the story
> of the rude half-developed, early humanity of the world in as clear a
> symbol to the expert and the archaeologist, as if written in
> alphabetical letters on monoliths, like those of Babylon.

> Without, therefore, being forced into shadowy theory or nebular
> hypothesis, we may readily construct the whole life of the primitive
> man, his mode of being and doing, of dressing and of eating, of
> living, dying and sepulture, simply from the rude implements fashioned
> by his hand that cover the walls of the Academy, and are the letters
> in which an eternal page of human history is written.

> But, this first pre-Adamic rudimental humanity was not wholly
> extirpated by the subsequent Adamic race. Representatives of them
> still remained throughout the world, and are yet existing, though
> these half-souled specimens of an early, inferior humanity, are
> gradually dying out and disappearing before the advance of the higher
> Adamic race, the destined lords and rulers of earth.

> In Ireland the inferior primitive tribes became the bond-slaves for
> the higher humanity--the Tuatha-de-Dananns and Milesians that
> succeeded them; and specimens of this slave people can still be seen
> in remote districts in Ireland along the coast-line of the West, and
> in the secluded mountain passes. They are held in much contempt by the
> descendants of the nobler race, and are stigmatized even now as "the
> slave people," and the bondsmen of their forefathers.

> It seems, then, an incontrovertible truth that the early inhabitants
> of Ireland, as of all Europe--in fact, the whole pre-Adamite humanity
> of the world--lived and died throughout how many ages we know not in a
> state little higher than the animal creation, without the knowledge of
> even the simplest elements of civilization, which all the Adamic races
> possess, from their higher organization and intellect, and which they
> seem to have had from the date of their earliest appearance on earth.

> The clothing of the primitive man was of the skins of animals fastened
> with thongs, or tunics made of rushes, such as were found some years
> ago in Spain, on the skeleton forms of prehistoric date buried in a
> cave of the Sierra Nevada. Their only weapons and tools were of stone,
> manufactured by another stone.

> Their ornaments were of shells and fish-bones; and their dwellings
> such only as instinct has suggested to all animals.

> There are abundant evidences in our National Museum to prove the
> existence of this primary stratum of barbarism underlying all the
> culture of modern Europe; and we might almost hesitate to link so low
> a type of humanity with our own if we did not recognize in it also the
> characteristic instinct of man, entirely wanting in the animals--an
> irrepressible tendency towards progression and improvement, and, above
> all, to ornamentation, which is a distinctive human quality.
