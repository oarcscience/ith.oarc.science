The Fairies' Revenge

> THE fairies have a great objection to the fairy raths, where they meet
> at night, being built upon by mortal man. A farmer called Johnstone,
> having plenty of money, bought some land, and chose a beautiful green
> spot to build a house on, the very spot the fairies loved best.

> The neighbours warned him that it was a fairy rath; but he laughed and
> never minded (for he was from the north), and looked at such things as
> mere old-wives' tales. So he built the house and made it beautiful to
> live in; and no people in the country were so well off as the
> Johnstones so that the people said the farmer must have found a pot of
> gold in the fairy rath.

> But the fairies were all the time plotting how they could punish the
> farmer for taking away their dancing ground, and for cutting down the
> hawthorn bush where they held their revels when the moon was full. And
> one day when the cows were milking, a little old woman in a blue cloak
> came to Mrs. Johnstone and asked her for a porringer of milk.

> "Go away," said the mistress of the house, "you shall have no milk
> from me. I'll have no tramps coming about my place." And she told the
> farm servants to chase her away.

> Some time after, the best and finest of the cows sickened and gave no
> milk, and lost her horns and teeth and finally died.

> Then one day as Mrs. Johnstone was sitting spinning flax in the
> parlour, the same little woman in the blue cloak suddenly stood before
> her.

> "Your maids are baking cakes in the kitchen," she said; "give me some
> off the griddle to carry away with me."

> "Go out of this," cried the farmers wife, angrily; "you are a wicked
> old wretch, and have poisoned my best cow." And she bade the farm
> servants drive her off with sticks.

> Now the Johnstones had one only child; a beautiful bright boy, as
> strong as a young colt, and as full of life and merriment. But soon
> after this he began to grow queer and strange, and was disturbed in
> his sleep; for he said the fairies came round him at night and pinched
> and beat. him, and some sat on his chest and he could neither breathe
> nor move. And they told him they would never leave him in peace unless
> he promised to give them a supper every night of a griddle cake and a
> porringer of milk. So to soothe the child the mother had these things
> laid every night on a table beside his bed, and in the morning they
> were gone.

> But still the child pined away, and his eyes got a strange, wild look,
> as if he saw nothing near or around him, only something far, far away
> that troubled his spirit. And when they asked him what ailed him, he
> said the fairies carried him away to the hills every night, where he
> danced and danced with them till the morning, when they brought him
> back and laid him again in his bed.

> At last the farmer and his wife were at their wits' end from grief and
> despair, for the child was pining away before their eyes, and they
> could do nothing for him to help him. One night he cried out in great
> agony--

> "Mother! mother! send for the priest to take away the fairies, for
> they are killing me; they are here on my chest, crushing me to death,"
> and his eyes were wild with terror.

> Now the farmer and his wife believed in no fairies, and in no priest,
> but to soothe the child they did as he asked and sent for the priest,
> who prayed over him and sprinkled him with holy water.

> The poor little fellow seemed calmer as the priest prayed, and he said
> the fairies were leaving him and going away, and then he sank into a
> quiet sleep. But when he woke in the morning he told his parents that
> he had a beautiful dream and was walking in a lovely garden with the
> angels; and he knew it was heaven, and that he would be there before
> night, for the angels told him they would come for him.

> Then they watched by the sick child all through the night, for they
> saw the fever was still on him, but hoped a change would come before
> morning; for he now slept quite calmly with a smile on his lips.

> But just as the clock struck midnight. he awoke and sat up, and when
> his mother put her arms round him weeping, he whispered to her--

> "The angels are here, mother," and then he sank back, and so died.

> Now after this calamity the farmer never held up his head. He ceased
> to mind his farm, and the crops went to ruin and the cattle died, and
> finally before a year and a day were over he was laid in the grave by
> the side of his little son; and the land passed into other hands, and
> as no one would live in the house it was pulled down. No one, either,
> would plant on the rath; so the grass grew again all over it, green
> amid beautiful, and the fairies danced there once more in the
> moonlight as they used to do in the old time, free and happy; and thus
> the evil spell was broken for evermore.

> But the people would have nothing to do with the childless mother, so
> she went away back to her own people, a brokenhearted, miserable
> woman--a warning to all who would arouse the vengeance of the fairies
> by interfering with their ancient rights and possessions and
> privileges.
