The Poison Cup

> St. Patrick went on to Tara, and there he lit the Paschal fire and
> celebrated the Easter mysteries. But the Druids were wroth, for it was
> against their ordinances for any fire to be lit until the chief Druid
> himself had kindled the sacred fire. Therefore they sought to poison
> St. Patrick, and a cupful of poison was given him by one of the
> Druids; but the danger, as revealed to him, and thereupon he
> pronounced certain words over the liquor, and whoever pronounceth
> these words over poison shall receive no injury from it. He also then
> composed the prayer, "In nomine Dei Patris," and recited it over the
> cup of poison.

> The number of companions with whom St. Patrick travelled through the
> country was seven score and ten, and before his time only three
> classes of persons were allowed to speak in public in Erin--the
> chronicler, to relate events; the poet, to eulogize and satirize; and
> the Brehon, to pass judgment according to the law. But after St.
> Patrick's arrival every utterance of the three professions was subject
> to "the men of the white language"--that is, the Gospel--and only such
> utterances were allowed as did not clash with the Gospel.
