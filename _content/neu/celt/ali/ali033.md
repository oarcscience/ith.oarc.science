November Eve

> It is esteemed a very wrong thing amongst the islanders to be about on
> November Eve, minding any business, for the fairies have their
> flitting then, and do not like to be seen,or watched; and all the
> spirits come to meet them and help them. But mortal people should keep
> at home, or they will suffer for it; for the souls of the dead have
> power over all things on that one night of the year; and they hold a
> festival with the fairies, and drink red wine from the fairy cups, and
> dance to fairy music till the moon goes down.

> There was a man of the village who stayed out late one November Eve
> fishing, and never thought of the fairies until he saw a great number
> of dancing lights, and a crowd of people hurrying past with baskets
> and bags, and all laughing and singing and making merry as they went
> alone.

> "You are a merry set," he said, "where are ye all going to?"

> "We are going to the fair," said a little old man with a cocked hat
> and a gold band round it. "Come with us, Hugh King, and you will have
> the finest food and the finest drink you ever set eyes upon."

> "And just carry this basket for me," said a little red-haired Woman.

> So Hugh took it, and went with them till they came to the fair, which
> was filled with a crowd of people he had never seen on the island in
> all his days. And they danced and laughed and drank red wine from
> little cups. And there were pipers, and harpers, and little cobblers
> mending shoes, and all the most beautiful things in the world to eat
> and drink, just as if they were in a kings palace. But the basket was
> very heavy, and Hugh longed to drop it, that he might go and chance
> with a little beauty with long yellow hair, that was laughing up close
> to his face.

> "Well, here put down the basket," said the red-haired woman, "for you
> are quite tired, I see;" and she took it and opened the cover, and out
> came a little old man, the ugliest, most misshapen little imp that
> could be imagined.

> "Ah, thank you, Hugh," said the imp, quite politely; "you have carried
> me nicely; for I am weak on the limbs--indeed I have nothing to speak
> of in the way of legs: but I'll pay you well, my fine fellow; hold out
> your two hands," and the little imp poured down gold and gold and gold
> into them, bright golden guineas. "Now go," said he, "and drink my
> health, and make yourself quite pleasant, and don't be afraid of
> anything you see and hear."

> So they all left him, except the man with the cocked hat and time red
> sash round his waist.

> "Wait here now a bit," says he, "for Finvarra, the king, is coming,
> and his wife, to see the fair."

> As he spoke, the sound of a horn was heard, and up drove a coach and
> four white horses, and out of it stepped a grand, grave gentleman all
> in black and a beautiful lady with a silver veil over her face.

> "Here is Finvarra himself and the queen," said the little old man; but
> Hugh was ready to die of fright when Finvarra asked--

> "What brought this man here?"

> And the king frowned and looked so black that Hugh nearly fell to the
> ground with fear. Then they all laughed, and laughed so loud that
> everything seemed shaking and tumbling down from time laughter. And
> the dancers came up, and they all danced round Hugh, and tried to take
> his hands to make him dance with them.

> "Do you know who these people are; and the men and women who are
> dancing round you?" asked the old man. "Look well, have you ever seen
> them before?"

> And when Hugh looked he saw a girl that had died the year before, then
> another and another of his friends that he knew had died long ago; and
> then he saw that all the dancers, men, women, and girls, were the dead
> in their long, white shrouds. And he tried to escape from them, but
> could not, for they coiled round him, and danced and laughed and
> seized his arms, and tried to draw him into the dance, and their laugh
> seemed to pierce through his brain and kill him. And he fell down
> before them there, like one faint from sleep, and knew no more till he
> found himself next morning lying within the old stone circle by the
> fairy rath on the hill. Still it was all true that he had been with
> the fairies; no one could deny it, for his arms were all black with
> the touch of the hands of the dead, the time they had tried to draw
> him into the dance; but not one bit of all the red gold, which the
> little imp had given him, could he find in his pocket. Not one single
> golden piece; it was all gone for evermore.

> And Hugh went sadly to his home, for now he knew that the spirits had
> mocked him and punished him, because he troubled their revels on
> November Eve--that one night of all the year when the dead can leave
> their graves and dance in the moonlight on the hill, and mortals
> should stay at home and never dare to look on them.
