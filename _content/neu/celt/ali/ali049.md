Evil Spells

Cathal the King

> IT is said by time wise women and fairy doctors that the roots of the
> elder tree, and the roots of an apple tree that bears red apples, if
> boiled together and drunk fasting, will expel any evil living thing or
> evil spirit that may have taken up its abode in the body of a man.

> But an evil charm to produce a living thing in the body can also be
> made, by pronouncing a certain magic and wicked spell over the food or
> drink taken by any person that an enemy wishes to injure.

> One should therefore he very cautious in accepting anything to eat
> from a person of known malicious tongue and spiteful heart, or who has
> an ill will against you, for poison lies in their glance and in the
> touch of their hands; and an evil spell is in their very presence, and
> on all they do, say, or touch.

> Cathal, king of Munster, was the tallest and handsomest of all the
> kings of Erin, and he fell deeply in love with the beautiful sister of
> Fergus, king of Ulster; and the lovers were happy in, their love and
> resolved on marriage. But Fergus, King of the North, had a mortal
> hatred to Cathal, King of the South, and wished, in secret, to prevent
> the marriage. So he set a watch over his sister, and by this means
> found out that she was sending a basket of the choicest apples to her
> lover, by the hands of a trusty messenger. On this Fergus managed to
> get hold of the basket of fruit from the messenger; and he changed
> them secretly for another lot of apples, over which he worked an evil
> spell. Furnished with these the messenger set out for Cathal, and
> presented them to Cathal the king, who, delighted at this proof of
> love from his princess, began at once to eat the apples. But the more
> he ate, the more he longed for them, for a wicked spell was on every
> apple. When he had eaten them all up, he sent round the country for
> more, and ate, and ate, until there was not aim apple left in Cashel,
> nor in all the country round.

> Then he bade his chieftains go forth and bring in food to appease his
> appetite; and he ate up all the cattle and the grain and the fruit,
> and still cried for more; and had the houses searched for food to
> bring to him. So the people were in despair, for they had no more
> food, and starvation was over the land.

> Now a great and wise man, the chief poet of his tribe, happened to be
> travelling through Munster at that time, and hearing of the king's
> state, he greatly desired to see him, for he knew there was devil's
> work in te evil spell. So they brought him to the king, and many
> strong invocations he uttered over him, and many powerful
> incantations, for poets have a knowledge of mysteries above all other
> men; until finally, after three days had passed, he announced to the
> lords and chiefs that on that night, when the moon rose, the spell
> would be broken, and time king restored to his wonted health. So all
> the chiefs gathered round in the courtyard to watch; but no one was
> allowed to enter the room where the king lay, save only the poet. And
> he was to give the signal when the hour had come and the spell was
> broken.

> So as they watched, and just as the moon rose, a great cry was heard
> from the king's room, and the poet, flinging open the door, bade the
> chiefs enter; and there on the floor lay a huge dead wolf, who for a
> whole year had taken up his abode in the king's body; but was now
> happily cast forth by the strong incantations of the poet.

> After this the king fell into a deep sleep, and when he arose he was
> quite well, and strong again as ever, in all the pride of his youth
> and beauty. At this the people rejoiced much, for he was greatly
> loved, and the poet who had restored him was honoured above all men in
> the land; for the king himself took off the golden torque from his own
> neck, and placed it on that of the poet, and he set him at his right
> hand at the feast.

> Now a strange thing happened just at this time; for Fergus, King of
> the North, fell ill, and wasted away to a shadow, and of all the
> beautiful meats and wines they set before him he could taste nothing.
> So he died before a year had passed by; and then Cathal the king
> wedded his beloved princess, and they lived happily through many
> years.
