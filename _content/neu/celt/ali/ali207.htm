<BLOCKQUOTE>AT <I>Tober Mire, </I>the well of the field of worship, County Cork, there are also many pagan monuments, and it is evident that the vicinity was one of time strongholds of the Druids in ancient times, where they had a temple, a burial-ground, and stones for sacrifice: a much larger population existed also round the temple than can now be numbered in the same locality.</BLOCKQUOTE>
