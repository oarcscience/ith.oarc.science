The Three Gifts

> A GREAT, noble-looking man called one night at a cottage, and told the
> woman that she must come away with him then and there on the instant,
> for his wife wanted a nurse for her baby. And so saying, before she
> could answer, he swung her up on his great black horse on a pillion
> behind him. And she sat wondering at his tall, shadowy form, for she
> could see the moonlight through him.

> "Do not fear," he said, "and no harm will happen to you. Only ask no
> questions whatever happens, and drink no wine that may be offered to
> you."

> On reaching the palace she saw the most beautiful ladies going about
> all covered with jewels, and she was led into a chamber hung with silk
> and gold, and lace as fine as cobwebs; and there on a bed supported by
> crystal pillars lay the mother, lovely as an angel, and her little
> baby beside her. And when the nurse had dressed the baby and handed it
> to the mother, the lady smiled and offered her wine; "for then," she
> said, "you will never leave us, and I would love to have you always
> near me."

> But the woman refused, though she was sorely tempted by the beautiful
> bright red wine.

> "Well*,* then," said the lord and master, "here are three gifts, and
> you may take them away in safety, for no harm will come to you by
> them. A purse, never to be opened, but while you have it, you will
> never want money; a girdle, and whoso wears it will never be slain in
> battle; and an herb that has power to cure all diseases for seven
> generations."

> So the woman was put again upon the horse with her three gifts, and
> reached her home safely. Then, from curiosity, the first thing she did
> was to open the purse, and behold, there was nothing in it but some
> wild flowers. On seeing this, she was so angry that she flung away the
> herb, "for they were only making a fool of me," she said, "and I don't
> believe one word of their stories." But the husband took the belt and
> kept it safe, and it went down in the family from father to son; and
> the last man who wore it was out in all the troubles of '98, and
> fought in every one of the battles, but he never got hurt or wound.
> However, after his death, no one knew what became of the belt; it was
> never seen more.

> \*

> A woman was carried off one night to a fairy palace to attend one of
> the beautiful fairy ladies who lay sick on her golden bed. And as she
> was going in at the gate a man whispered to her, "Eat no food, and
> take no money from the fairies; but ask what you like and it will be
> granted." So when the fairy lady was well, she bade the nurse ask what
> she pleased. The woman answered, "I desire three things for my sons
> and their race--luck in fishing, luck in learning, and luck in
> gambling," which things were granted--and to this day the family are
> the richest, the wisest, and the luckiest in the whole neighbourhood.
> They win at every game, and at every race, but always by fair play and
> without cheating; and not the priest himself can beat them at book
> learning. And every one knows that the power comes to them from the
> fairy gift, though good luck comes with it and not evil; and all the
> work of their hands has prospered through every generation since the
> day of the Three Wishes.
