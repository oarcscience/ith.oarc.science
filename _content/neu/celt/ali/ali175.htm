<BLOCKQUOTE>One day the two daughters of the King of Meath, named Ethna and Fedalma, went down to the river to bathe, and there they beheld St. Patrick and his band of converts all draped in white robes, for they were celebrating morning prayers. And the princesses seeing strange men in white garments thought they were of the race of the male fairies, the <I>Daine-Sidhe. </I>And they questioned them. Then St. Patrick expounded the truth to them, and the maidens asked him many questions: "Who is your God? Is He handsome? Are His daughters as handsome as we are? Is He rich? Is He young or aged? Is he to die, or does He live for ever?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now St. Patrick having satisfied them on all these points the maidens, Ethna and Fedalma, were baptized, and became zealous workers for the Christian cause.</BLOCKQUOTE>
