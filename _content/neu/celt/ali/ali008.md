Fairy Music

> THE evil influence of the fairy glance does not kill, but it throws
> the object into a death-like trance, in which the real body is carried
> off to some fairy mansion, while a log of wood, or some ugly, deformed
> creature is left in its place, clothed with the shadow of the stolen
> form. Young women, remarkable for beauty, young men, and handsome
> children, are the chief victims of the fairy stroke. The girls are
> wedded to fairy chiefs, and the young men to fairy queens; and if the
> mortal children do not turn out well, they are sent back, and others
> carried off in their place. It is sometimes possible, by the spells of
> a powerful fairy-man, to bring back a living being from Fairy-land.
> But they are never quite the same after. They have always a
> spirit-look, especially if they have listened to the fairy music. For
> the fairy music is soft and low and plaintive, with a fatal charm for
> mortal ears.

> One day a gentleman entered a cabin in the County Clare, and saw a
> young girl about twenty seated by the fire, chanting a melancholy
> song, without settled words or music. On inquiry he was told she had
> once heard the fairy harp, and those who hear it lose all memory of
> love or hate, and forget all things, and never more have any other
> sound in their ears save the soft music of the fairy harp, and when
> the spell is broken, they die.

> It is remarkable that the Irish national airs--plaintive, beautiful,
> and unutterably pathetic--should so perfectly express the spirit of
> the Céol-Sidhe (the fairy music), as it haunts the fancy of the people
> and mingles with all their traditions of the spirit world. Wild and
> capricious as the fairy nature, these delicate harmonies, with their
> mystic, mournful rhythm, seem to touch the deepest chords of feeling,
> or to fill the sunshine with laughter, according to the mood of the
> players; but, above all things, Irish music is the utterance of a
> Divine sorrow; not stormy or passionate, but like that of an exiled
> spirit, yearning and wistful, vague and unresting; ever seeking the
> unattainable, ever shadowed, as it were, with memories of some lost
> good, or some dim foreboding of a coming fate--emotions that seem to
> find their truest expression in the sweet, sad, lingering wail of the
> pathetic minor in a genuine Irish air. There is a beautiful phrase in
> one of the ancient manuscripts descriptive of the wonderful power of
> Irish music over the sensitive human organization: "Wounded men were
> soothed when they heard it, and slept; and women in travail forgot
> their pains." There are legends concerning the subtle charm of the
> fairy music and dance, when the mortal under their influence seems to
> move through the air with "the naked, fleshless feet of the spirit,"
> and is lulled by the ecstasy of the cadence into forgetfulness of all
> things, and sometimes into the sleep of death.
