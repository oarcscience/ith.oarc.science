The Strange Guests

> A COMPANY of strangers came one day to Rathlin island and the people
> distrusted them, but pretended to be friendly, and invited them to a
> feast, meaning to put an end to them all when they came unarmed to the
> festival, and the drink flowed freely. So the strangers came, but each
> man as he sat down drew his knife and stuck it in the table before him
> ere he began to eat. When the islanders saw their guests so well
> prepared, they were afraid; and the feast passed off quietly.

> The next morning early, the strangers sailed away before any one was
> aware on the island; but on time table where each guest had sat, a
> piece of silver was found, covering the hole made by the knife. So the
> islanders rejoiced, and determined never again to plot evil against
> the wayfaring guests; but to be kind and hospitable to all wanderers
> for the sake of the Holy Mother, who had sent them to the island to
> bring good luck to the people. But they never saw the strangers more.

> The islanders have great faith in the power of the Virgin Mary, for
> our Lord Himself told St. Bridget that His mother had a throne in
> heaven near his own; and whatever she asked of God it was granted,
> especially if it was any grace or favour for the Irish people, because
> he held them in great esteem on account of their piety and good works.
