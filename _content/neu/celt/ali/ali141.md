For Chin-Cough

> A griddle cake made of meal, to be given, not bought or made; but a
> cake *qiven* of love or of charity, not for begging; a cake given
> freely, with a prayer and a blessing; and from the breakfast of a man
> and his wife who had the same name before marriage; this is the cure.

> The touch of a piebald horse. Even a piebald horse pawing before the
> door helps the cure.

> The child to be passed seven times under and over an ass while a red
> string is tied on the throat of the patient.

> Nine hairs from the tail of a black cat, chopped up and soaked in
> water, which is then swallowed, and the cough will be relieved.

> "One day when out, snipe shooting," a gentleman writes, "I saw a
> horrid-looking insect staring up at me. I called to a man close by,
> and asked him the name of it. He told me it was called the *Thordall,*
> and was reckoned a great cure for the *chin-cough;* for if any one got
> it safe in a bottle and kept it prisoner till it, died, the disease
> would go away from the patient. It was just the time to try the cure,
> for my child was laid up with the epidemic. So I bottled my friend and
> daily examined the state of his health. It lasted for a fortnight, and
> at the end of that time the child had quite recovered, and the
> horrible-looking insect creature lay dead."
