<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Properties of Herbs and their Use in Medicine</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THE Irish, according to the saying of a wise man of the race, are the last of the 305 great Celtic nations of antiquity spoken of by Josephus, the Jewish historian; and they alone preserve inviolate the ancient venerable language, minstrelsy, and Bardic traditions, with the strange and mystic secrets of herbs, through whose potent powers they can cure disease, cause love or hatred, discover the hidden mysteries of life and death, and dominate over the fairy wiles or the malific demons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The ancient people used to divine future events, victory in wars, safety in a dangerous voyage, triumph of a projected undertaking, success in love, recovery from sickness, or the approach of death; all through the skilful use of herbs, the knowledge of which had come down to them through the earliest traditions of the human race. One of these herbs, called the <I>Fairy-plant, </I>was celebrated for its potent power pf divination; but only the adepts knew the mystic manner of its preparation for use.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There was another herb of which a drink was made, called <I>the Bardic potion, </I>for the Bards alone had the secret of the herb, and of the proper mode of treatment by which its mystic power could be revealed. This potion they gave their infant children at their birth, for it had the singular property of endowing the recipient with a fairy sweetness of voice of the most rapturous and thrilling charm. And instances are recorded of men amongst the Celtic Bards, who, having drunk of this potion in early life, were ever after endowed with the sweet voice, like fairy music, that swayed the hearts of the hearers as they chose to love or war, joy or sadness, as if by magic influence, or lulled them into the sweet calm of sleep. Such, according to the Bardic legends, was the extraordinary power of voice possessed by the great Court Minstrel of Fionn Ma-Coul, who resided with the great chief at his palace of Almhuin, and always sat next him at the royal table.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The virtue of herbs is great, but they must be gathered at night, and laid in the hand of a dead man to hold. There are herbs that produce love, and herbs that produce sterility; but only the fairy doctor knows the secrets of their power, and he will reveal the knowledge to no man unless to an adept. The wise women learn the mystic powers from the fairies, but how they pay for the knowledge none dare to tell.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fairy doctors are often seized with trembling while uttering a charm, and look round with a scared glance of terror, as if some awful presence were beside them. But the people have, the most perfect faith in the herb-men and wise women, and the faith may often work the cure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are seven herbs of great value and power; they are ground ivy, vervain, eyebright, groundsel, foxglove, the bark of the elder-tree, and the young shoots of the hawthorn.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Nine balls of these mixed together may be taken, and afterwards a potion made of bog-water and salt, boiled in a vessel, with a piece of money and an elf-stone. The elf-stone is generally found near a rath; it has great virtues, but being once lifted up by the spade it must never again touch the earth, or all its virtue is gone. (This elf-stone is in reality only an ancient stone arrowhead.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The <I>Mead Caileath, </I>or wood anemone, is used as a plaister for wounds.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The hazel-tree has many virtues. It is sacred and powerful against devils' wiles, and has mysteries and secret properties known to the wise and the adepts. The ancient Irish believed that there were fountains at the head of the chief rivers of Ireland, over each of which grew nine hazel-trees that at certain times produced beautiful red nuts. These nuts fell on the surface of the water, and the salmon in the river came up and ate of them, which caused the red spots on the salmon. ' And whoever could catch and eat one of these salmon would be indued with the sublimest poetic intellect. hence the phrase current amongst the people: "Had I the net of science;" "Had I eaten of the salmon of knowledge." And this supernatural knowledge came to the great Fionn through the touch of a salmon, and made him foreknow all events.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Of all herbs the yarrow is the best for cures and potions. It is even sewn up in clothes as a preventive of disease.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The <I>Liss-more, </I>or great herb, has also strong healing power, and is used as a charm.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
There is an herb, also, or fairy grass, called the,Faud <I>Shaughran, </I>or the "stray sod," and whoever treads the path it grows on is compelled by an irresistible impulse to travel on without stopping, all through the night, delirious and restless, over bog and mountain, through hedges and ditches, till wearied and bruised and cut, his garments torn, his hands bleeding, he finds himself in the morning twenty or thirty miles, perhaps, from his own home. And those who fall under this strange influence have all the time the sensation of flying and are utterly unable to pause or turn back or change their career. There is, however, another herb that can neutralize the effects of the <I>Faud Shaughran, </I>but only the initiated can utilize its mystic properties.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Another grass is the <I>Fair-Gortha, </I>or the "hunger-stricken sod," and if the hapless traveller accidentally treads on this grass by the road-side, while passing on a journey, either by night or day, he becomes at once seized with the most extraordinary cravings of hunger and weakness, and unless timely relief is afforded he must certainly die.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>When a child is sick a fairy woman is generally sent for, who makes a drink for the patient of those healing herbs of which she only has the knowledge. A childless woman is considered to have the strongest power over the secrets of herbs, especially those used' for the maladies of children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is an herb, grown on one of the western islands off the coast of Connemara, which is reported to have great and mystic power. But no one will venture to pronounce its name. If it is desired to know for certain whether one lying sick will recover, the nearest relative must go out and look for the herb just as the sun is rising And while holding it in the hand, an ancient form of incantation must be said. If the herb remains fresh and green the patient will certainly recover, but if it wither in the hand while the words of the incantation are said over it, then the sick person is doomed. He will surely die.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It was from their great knowledge of the properties of herbs that the Tuatha-de-Dananns obtained the reputation of being sorcerers and necromancers. At the great battle of Moytura in Mayo, fought about three thousand years ago, Dianecht, the great, wise Druid physician to the army, prepared a bath of herbs and plants in the line of the battle, of such wonderful curative efficacy that the wounded who were plunged into it came out whole, it being a sovereign remedy for all diseases. But the king of the Tuatha having lost his hand in the combat, the bath had no power to heal him. So Dianecht made him a silver hand, and the monarch was ever after known in history as <I>Nuad Airgeat lamh </I>(Nuad of the silver hand).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All herbs pulled on May Day Eve have a sacred healing power, if pulled in the name of the Holy Trinity; but if in the name of Satan, they work evil. Some herbs are malific if broken by the hand. So the plant is tied to a dog's foot, and when he runs it breaks, without a hand touching it, and may be used with safety.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A man pulled a certain herb on May Eve to cure his son who was sick to death. The boy recovered, but disappeared and was never heard of after, and the father died that day year. He had broken the fatal herb with the hand and so the doom fell on him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Another man did the like, and gave the herb to his son to eat, who immediately began to bark like a dog, and so continued till he died.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fatal herbs have signs known only to the fairy doctors, who should always be consulted before treating the sick in the family.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are <I>seven </I>herbs that nothing natural or supernatural can injure; they are vervain, John's-wort, speedwell, eyebright, mallow, yarrow, and self-help. But they must be pulled at noon on a bright day, near the full of the moon, to have full power.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is firmly believed that the herb-women who perform curses receive their knowledge from the fairies, who impart to them the mystical secrets of herbs and where to find them; but these secrets must not be revealed except on the death-bed, and then only to the eldest of the family. Many mysterious rites are practised in the making and the giving of potions; and the messenger who carries the draught to the sufferer must never look behind him nor utter a word till he hands the medicine to the patient, who instantly swallows a cup of the mixture before other hands have touched it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A celebrated doctor in the south was an old woman, who had lived seven years with the fairies, She performed wonderful cures, and only required a silver tenpence to be laid on her table for the advice given and for the miraculous herb potion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
