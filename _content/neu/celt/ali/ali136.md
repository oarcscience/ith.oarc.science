For Toothache

> Go to a graveyard; kneel upon any grave; say three paters and three
> ayes for the soul of the dead lying beneath. Then take a handful of
> grass from the grave, chew it well, casting forth each bite without
> swallowing any portion. After this process the sufferer, were he to
> live a hundred years, will never have toothache any more.

> Another.

> The patient must vow a vow to God, the Virgin, and the new moon, never
> to comb his hair on a Friday, in remembrance of relief should he be
> cured; and whenever or wherever he first sees the moon he must fall on
> his knees and say five prayers in gratitude for the cure, even if
> crossing a river at the time.

> Another.

> Carry in your pocket the two jaw-bones of a haddock; for ever since
> the miracle of the loaves and fishes these bones are an infallible
> remedy against toothache, and the older they are the better, as nearer
> the time of the miracle.

> Also this charm is to be sewn on the clothes--

> "As Peter sat on a marble stone,  
> The Lord came to him all alone,  
> 'Peter, Peter, what makes you shake?'  
> 'O Lord and Master, it is the toothache.'  
> Then Christ said, 'Take these for My sake,  
> And never more you'll have toothache.'"

>  

> To avoid toothache never shave on a Sunday.
