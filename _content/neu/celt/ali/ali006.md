The Evil Eye

> THERE is nothing more dreaded by the people, nor considered more
> deadly in its effects, than the Evil Eye.

> It may strike at any moment unless the greatest precautions are taken,
> and even then there is no true help possible unless the fairy doctor
> is at once summoned to pronounce the mystic charm that can alone
> destroy the evil and fatal influence.

> There are several modes in which the Evil Eye can act, some much more
> deadly than others. If certain persons are met the first thing in the
> morning, you will be unlucky for the whole of that day in all you do.
> If the evil-eyed comes in to rest, and looks fixedly on anything, on
> cattle or on a child, there is doom in the glance; a fatality which
> cannot be evaded except by a powerful counter-charm. But if the
> evil-eyed mutters a verse over a sleeping child, that child will
> assuredly die, for the incantation is of the devil, and no charm has
> power to resist it or turn away the evil. Sometimes the process of
> bewitching is effected by looking fixedly at the object, through nine
> fingers; especially is the magic fatal if the victim is seated by the
> fire in the evening when the moon is full. Therefore, to avoid being
> suspected of having the Evil Eye, it is necessary at once, when
> looking at a child, to say "God bless it." And when passing a farmyard
> where the cows are collected for milking, to say, "The blessing of God
> be on you and on all your labours." If this form is omitted, the worst
> results may be apprehended, and the people would be filled with terror
> and alarm, unless a counter-charm were not instantly employed.

> The singular malific influence of a glance has been felt by most
> persona in life; an influence that seems to paralyze intellect and
> speech, simply by the mere presence in the room of some one who is
> mystically antipathetic to our nature. For the soul is like a
> fine-toned harp that vibrates to the slightest external force or
> movement, and the presence and glance of some persons can radiate
> around us a divine joy, while others may kill the soul with a sneer or
> a frown. We call these subtle influences mysteries, but the early
> races believed them to be produced by spirits, good or evil, as they
> acted on the nerves or the intellect.

> Some years ago an old woman was living in Kerry, and it was thought so
> unlucky to meet her in the morning, that all the girls used to go out
> after sunset to bring in water for the following day, that so they
> might avoid her evil glance; for whatever she looked on came to loss
> and grief.

> There was a man, also, equally dreaded on account of the strange,
> fatal power of his glance; and so many accidents and misfortunes were
> traced to his presence that finally the neighbours insisted that he
> should wear a black patch over the Evil Eye, not to be removed unless
> by request; for learned gentlemen, curious in such things, sometimes
> came to him to ask for a proof of his power, and he would try it for a
> wager while drinking with his friends.

> One day, near an old ruin of a castle, he met a boy weeping in great
> grief for his pet pigeon, which had got up to the very top of the
> ruin, and could not be coaxed down.

> "What will you give me," asked the man, "if I bring it down for you?"

> "I have nothing to give," said the boy, "but I will pray to God for
> you. Only get me back my pigeon, and I shall be happy."

> Then the man took off the black patch and looked up steadfastly at the
> bird; when all of a sudden it fell to the ground and lay motionless,
> as if stunned; but there was no harm done to it, and the boy took it
> up and went his way, rejoicing.

> \*

> A woman in the County Galway had a beautiful child, so handsome, that
> all the neighbours were very careful to say "God bless it" when they
> saw him, for they knew the fairies would desire to steal the child,
> and carry it off to the hills.

> But one day it chanced that an old woman, a stranger, came in. "Let me
> rest," she said, "for I am weary." And she sat down and looked at the
> child, but never said "God bless it." And when she had rested, she
> rose up, looked again at the child fixedly, in silence, and then went
> her way.

> All that night the child cried and would not sleep. And all next day
> it moaned as if in pain. So the mother told the priest, but he would
> do nothing for fear of the fairies. And just as the poor mother was in
> despair, she saw a strange woman going by the door. "Who knows," she
> said to her husband, "but this woman would help us." So they asked her
> to come in and rest. And when she looked at the child she said "God
> bless it," instantly, and spat three times at it, and then sat down.

> "Now, what will you give me," she said, "if I tell you what ails the
> child?"

> "I will cross your hand with silver," said the mother, "as much as you
> want, only speak," and she laid the money on the woman's hand. "Now
> tell me the truth, for the sake and in the name of Mary, and the good
> Angels."

> "Well," said the stranger," the fairies have had your child these two
> days in the hills, and this is a changeling they have left in its
> place. But so many blessings were said on your child that the fairies
> can do it no harm. For there was only one blessing wanting, and only
> one person gave the Evil Eye. Now, you must watch for this woman,
> carry her into the house and secretly cut off a piece of her cloak.
> Then burn the piece close to the child, till the smoke as it rises
> makes him sneeze; and when this happens the spell is broken, and your
> own child will come back to you safe and sound, in place of the
> changeling."

> Then the stranger rose up and went her way.

> All that evening the mother watched for the old woman, and at last she
> spied her on the road.

> "Come in," she cried, "come in, good woman, and rest, for the cakes
> are hot on the griddle, and supper is ready."

> So the woman came in, but never said "God bless you kindly," to man or
> mortal, only scowled at the child, who cried worse than ever.

> Now the mother had told her eldest girl to cut off a piece of the old
> woman's cloak, secretly, when she sat down to eat. And the girl did as
> she was desired, and handed the piece to her mother, unknown to any
> one. But, to their surprise, this was no sooner done than the woman
> rose up and went out without uttering a word; and they saw her no
> more.

> Then the father carried the child outside, and burned the piece of
> cloth before the door, and held the boy over the smoke till he sneezed
> three times violently: after which he gave the child back to the
> mother, who laid him in his bed, where he slept peacefully, with a
> smile on his face, and cried no more with the cry of pain. And when he
> woke up the mother knew that she had got her own darling child back
> from the fairies, and no evil thing happened to him any more.

> The influence of the mysterious and malign power of the Evil Eye has
> at all times been as much dreaded in Ireland as it is in Egypt,
> Greece, or Italy at the present day. Everything young beautiful, or
> perfect after its kind, and which naturally attracts attention and
> admiration, is peculiarly liable to the fatal blight that follows the
> glance of the Evil Eye. It is therefore an invariable habit amongst
> the peasantry never to praise anything without instantly adding, "God
> bless it;" for were this formula omitted, the worst consequences would
> befall the object praised.

> The superstition must be of great antiquity in Ireland, for Balor, the
> Fomorian giant and hero, is spoken of in an ancient manuscript as able
> to petrify his enemies by a glance; and how ho became possessed of the
> power is thus narrated:--

> One day as the Druids were busy at their incantations, while boiling a
> magical spell or charm, young Balor passed by, and curious to see
> their work, looked in at an open window. At that moment the Druids
> happened to raise the lid of the caldron, and the vapour, escaping,
> passed under one of Balor's eyes, carrying with it all the venom of
> the incantation. This caused his brow to grow to such a size that it
> required four men to raise it whenever he wanted to exert the power of
> his venomed glance over his enemies. He was slain at last in single
> combat, according to the ancient legend, at the great battle of
> Magh-Tura (the plain of the towers--now called Moytura), fought
> between the Firbolgs and the Tuatha-de-Dananns for the possession of
> Ireland several centuries before the Christian era; for before Balor's
> brow could be lifted so that he could transfix his enemy and strike
> him dead with the terrible power of his glance, his adversary flung a
> stone with such violence that it went right through the Evil Eye, and
> pierced the skull, and the mighty magician fell to rise no more.

> An interesting account of this battle, with a remarkable confirmation
> of the legends respecting it still current in this district, is given
> by Sir William Wilde, in his work, "Lough Corrib; its Shores and
> Islands." In the ancient manuscript, it is recorded that a young hero
> having been slain while bravely defending his king, the Firbolg army
> erected a mound over him, each man carrying a stone, and the monument
> was henceforth known as the *Carn-in-en-Fhir* (the cairn of the one
> man). Having examined the locality with a transcript of this
> manuscript in his hand, Sir William fixed on the particular mound,
> amongst the many stone tumuli scattered over the plain, which seemed
> to agree best with the description, and had it opened carefully under
> his own superintendence.

> A large flag-stone was first discovered, laid horizontally; then
> another beneath it, covering a small square chamber formed of stones,
> within which was a *single urn* of baked clay, graceful and delicate
> in form and ornamentation, containing incinerated human bones, the
> remains, there can be no reason to doubt, of the Firbolg youth who was
> honoured for his loyalty by the erection over him of the
> *Carn-in-en-Fhir* on the historic plains of Mayo.

> After Balor, the only other ancient instance of the fatal effects of
> the maliflc Eye is narrated of St. Silan, who had a poisonous hair in
> his eyebrow that killed whoever looked first on him in the morning.
> All persons, therefore, who from long sickness, or sorrow, or the
> Weariness that comes with years, were tired of life, used to try and
> come in the saint's way, that so their sufferings might be ended by a
> quick and easy death. But another saint, the holy Molaise, hearing
> that St. Silan was coming to visit his church, resolved that no more
> deaths should happen by means of the poisoned hair. So he arose early
> in the morning, before any one was up, and went forth alone to meet
> St. Silan, and when he saw him coming along the path, he went boldly
> up and plucked out. the fatal hair from his eyebrow, but in doing so
> he himself was struck by the venom, and immediately after fell down
> dead.

> The power of the Evil Eye was recognized by the Brehon laws, and
> severe measures were ordained against the users of the malign
> influence. "If a person is in the habit of injuring things through
> neglect, or of will, whether he has blessed, or whether he has not
> blessed, full penalty be upon him, or restitution in kind." So ran the
> ancient law.

> The gift comes by nature and is born with one, though it may not be
> called into exercise unless circumstances arise to excite the power.
> Then it seems to act like a spirit of bitter and malicious envy that
> radiates a poisonous atmosphere which chills and blights everything
> within its reach. Without being superstitious every one has felt that
> there is such a power and succumbed to its influence in a helpless,
> passive way, as if all self-trust and self-reliant energy were utterly
> paralyzed by its influence.

> Suspected persons are held in great dread by the peasantry, and they
> recognize them at once by certain signs. Men and women with dark
> lowering eyebrows are especially feared, and the handsome children are
> kept out of their path lest they might be overlooked by them.

> Red hair is supposed to have a most malign influence, and it has even
> passed into a proverb: "Let not the eye of a red-haired woman rest on
> you."

> Many persons are quite unconscious that their glance or frown has this
> evil power until some calamity results, and then they strive not to
> look at any one full in the face, but to avert their eyes when
> speaking, lest misfortune might fall upon the person addressed. \[a\]

> The saving invocation, "God bless it! "is universally used when praise
> is bestowed, to prevent danger, and should a child fall sick some one
> is immediately suspected of having omitted the usual phrase out of
> malice and ill-will. Nothing is more dreaded by the peasantry than the
> full, fixed, direct glance of one suspected of the Evil Eye, and
> should it fall upon them, or on any of their household, a terrible
> fear and trembling of heart takes possession of them, which often ends
> in sickness or sometimes even in death.

> \*

> Some years ago a woman living in Kerry declared that she was
> "overlooked" by the Evil Eye. She had no pleasure in her life and no
> comfort, and she wasted away because of the fear that was on her,
> caused by the following singular circumstance:--

> Every time that she happened to leave home alone, and that no one was
> within call, she was met by a woman totally unknown to her, who,
> fixing her eyes on her in silence, with a terrible expression, cast
> her to the ground and proceeded to beat and pinch her till she was
> nearly senseless; after which her tormentor disappeared.

> Having experienced this treatment several times, the poor woman
> finally abstained altogether from leaving the house, unless protected
> by a servant or companion; and this precaution she observed for
> several years, during which time she never was molested. So at last
> she began to believe that the spell was broken, and that her strange
> enemy had departed for ever.

> In consequence she grew less careful about the usual precaution, and
> one day stepped down alone to a little stream that ran by the house to
> wash some clothes.

> Stooping down over her work, she never thought of any danger, and
> began to sing as she used to do in the light-hearted days before the
> spell was on her, when suddenly a dark shadow fell across the water,
> and looking up, she beheld to her horror the strange woman on the
> opposite side of the little stream, with her terrible eyes intently
> fixed on her, as hard and still as if she were of stone.

> Springing up with a scream of terror, she flung down her work, and ran
> towards the house; but soon she heard footsteps behind her, and in an
> instant she was seized, thrown down to the ground, and her tormentor
> began to beat her even worse than before, till she lost all
> consciousness; and in this state she was found by her husband, lying
> on her face and speechless. She was at once carried to the house, and
> all the care that affection and rural skill could bestow were lavished
> on her, but in vain. She, however, regained sufficient consciousness
> to tell them of the terrible encounter she had gone through, but died
> before the night had passed away.

> It was believed that the power of fascination by the glance, which is
> not necessarily an evil power like the Evil Eye, was possessed in a
> remarkable degree by learned and wise people, especially poets, so
> that they could make themselves loved and followed by any girl they
> liked, simply by the influence of the glance. About the year 1790, a
> young man resided in the County Limerick, who had this power in a
> singular and unusual degree. He was a clever, witty rhymer in the
> Irish language; and, probably, had the deep poet eyes that
> characterize warm and passionate poet-natures--eyes that even without
> necromancy have been known to exercise a powerful magnetic influence
> over female minds.

> One day, while travelling far from home, he came upon a bright,
> pleasant-looking farmhouse, and feeling weary, he stopped and
> requested a drink of milk and leave to rest. The farmer's daughter, a
> young, handsome girl, not liking to admit a stranger, as all the maids
> were churning, and she was alone in the house, refused him admittance.

> The young poet fixed his eyes earnestly on her face for some time in
> silence, then slowly turning round left the house, and walked towards
> a small grove of trees just opposite. There he stood for a few moments
> resting against a tree, and facing the house as if to take one last
> vengeful or admiring glance, then went his way without once turning
> round.

> The young girl had been watching him from the windows, and the moment
> he moved she passed out of the door like one in a dream, and followed
> him slowly, step by step, down the avenue. The maids grew alarmed, and
> called to her father, who ran out and shouted loudly for her to stop,
> but she never turned or seemed to heed. The young man, however, looked
> round, and seeing the whole family in pursuit, quickened his pace,
> first glancing fixedly at the girl for a moment. Immediately she
> sprang towards him, and they were both almost out of sight, when one
> of the maids espied a piece of paper tied to a branch of the tree
> where the poet had rested. From curiosity she took it down, and the
> moment the knot was untied, the farmer's daughter suddenly stopped,
> became quite still, and when her father came up she allowed him to
> lead her back to the house without resistance.

> When questioned, she said that she felt herself drawn by an invisible
> force to follow the young stranger wherever he might lead, and that
> she would have followed him through the world, for her life seemed to
> be bound up in his; she had no will to resist, and was conscious of
> nothing else but his presence. Suddenly, however, the spell was
> broken, and then she heard her father's voice, and knew how strangely
> she had acted. At the same time the power of the young man over her
> vanished, and the impulse to follow him was no longer in her heart.

> The paper, on being opened, wasfound to contain five mysterious words
> written in blood, and in this order--

> Sator.  
> Arepo.  
> Tenet.  
> Opera.  
> Rotas.

> These letters are so arranged that read in any way, right to left,
> left to right, up or down, the same words are produced; and when
> written in blood with a pen made of an eagle's feather, they form a
> charm which no woman (it is said) can resist; but the incredulous
> reader can easily test the truth of this assertion for himself.

> \*

> These popular stories are provokingly incomplete, and one cannot help
> regretting that the romance of "The Poet and the Farmer's Daughter"
> was not, brought to a happy termination; but the Irish tales are in
> general rather incoherent, more like remembered fragments of ancient
> stories than a complete, well-organized dramatic composition, with
> lights well placed, and a striking catastrophe. The opening is usually
> attractive, with the exciting formula, "Once upon a time," from which
> one always expects so much; and there is sure to be an old woman,
> weird and witchlike, capable of the most demoniacal actions, and a
> mysterious man who promises to be the unredeemed evil spirit of the
> tale; but in the end they both turn out childishly harmless, and their
> evil actions seldom go beyond stealing their neighbours' butter, or
> abducting a pretty girl, which sins mere mortals would be quite equal
> to, even without the aid of "the gods of the earth" and their renowned
> leader, Finvarra, the King of the Fairies. The following tale,
> however, of a case of abduction by fairy power, is well constructed.
> The hero of the narrative has our sympathy and interest, and it ends
> happily, which is considered a great merit by the Irish, as they
> dislike a tale to which they cannot append, as an epilogue, the hearty
> and outspoken "Thank God."

>  

> \[a\] There is a strange idea current in Europe at the, present time
> that one of the most remarkable potentates now living has this fatal
> gift and power of the Evil Eye.
