<BLOCKQUOTE>When St. Patrick was one time amongst the Pagan Irish they grew very fierce and seemed eager to kill him. Then his life being in great danger, he kneeled down before them and prayed to God for help and for the conversion of their souls. And the fervour of the prayer was so great that as the saint rose up the mark of his knees was left deep in the stone, and when the people saw the miracle they believed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now when he came to the next village the people said if he performed some wonder for them they also would believe and pray to his God. So St. Patrick drew a great circle on the ground and bade them stand outside it; and then he prayed, and lo! the water rushed up from the earth, and a well pure and bright as crystal filled the circle. And the people believed and were baptized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The well can be seen to this day, and is called <I>Tober-na-Lauer </I>(The Well of the Book), because St. Patrick placed his own prayer-book in the centre of the circle before the water rose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
