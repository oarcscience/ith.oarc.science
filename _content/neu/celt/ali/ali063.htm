<P ALIGN="CENTER">Marriage Rites</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>IN old times in Ireland it was thought right and proper to seem to use force in carrying off the bride to her husband. She was placed on a swift horse before the bridegroom, while all her kindred started in pursuit with shouts and cries. Twelve maidens attended the bride, and each was placed on horseback behind the young men who rode after the bridal pair. On arriving at her future home, the bride was met on the threshold by the bride&#173;groom's mother, who broke an oaten cake over her head as a good augury of plenty in the future. In the mountains where horses cannot travel, the bridal party walk in procession; the young men carrying torches of dried bogwood to light the bride over the ravines, for in winter the mountain streams are rapid and dangerous to cross.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;The Celtic ceremonial of marriage resembles the ancient Greek ritual in many points. A traveller in Ireland some fifty years ago, before politics had quite killed romance and ancient tradition in the hearts of the people, thus describes a rustic marriage festival which he came on by chance one evening in the wilds of Kerry--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;A large hawthorn tree that stood in the middle of a field near a stream was hung all over with bits of coloured stuff, while lighted rush candles were placed here and there amongst the branches, to symbolize, no doubt, the new life of brightness pre&#173;paring for the bridal pair. Then came a procession of boys marching slowly with flutes and pipes made of hollow reeds, and one struck a tin can with a stick at intervals, with a strong rhythmical cadence. This represented the plectrum. Others rattled slates and bones between their fingers, and beat time, after the manner of the Crotolistrai--a rude attempt at music, which appears amongst all nations of the earth, even the most savage. A boy followed, bearing a lighted torch of bogwood. Evidently he was Hymen, and the flame of love was his cognizance. After him came the betrothed pair hand-in-hand, a large square canopy of black stuff being held over their heads; the emblem, of course, of the mystery of love, shrouded and veiled from the prying light of day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;Behind the pair followed two attendants bearing hung over the heads of the young couple a sieve filled with meal; a sign of the plenty that would be in their house, and an omen of good luck and the blessing of children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;A wild chorus of dancers and singers closed the procession; the chorus of the epithalamium, and grotesque figures, probably the traditional fauns and satyrs, nymphs and bacchanals, mingled together with mad laughter and shouts and waving of green branches.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;The procession then moved on to a bonfire, evidently the ancient altar; and having gone round it three times, the black shroud was lifted from the bridal pair, amid they kissed each other before all the people, who shouted and waved their branches in approval.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;Then the preparations for the marriage supper began, on which, however, the traveller left them, having laid some money on the altar as an offering of good-will for the marriage future. At the wedding supper there was always plenty of eating and drinking, and dancing and the feast were prolonged till near morning, when the wedding song was sung by the whole party of friends standing, while the bride and bridegroom remained seated at the head of the table. The chorus of one of these ancient songs maybe thus literally translated from the Irish--</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"It is not day, nor yet day,<BR>
It is not day, nor yet morning; <BR>
It is not day, nor yet day, <BR>
For the moon is shining brightly."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;Another marriage song was sung in Irish frequently, each verse ending with the lines--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;"There is sweet enchanting music, and the golden harps are ringing;<BR>
And twelve comely maidens deck the bride-bed for the bride."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;A beautiful new dress was presented to the bride by her husband at the marriage feast; at which also the father paid down her dowry before the assembled guests; and all the place round the house was lit by torches when night came on, and the song and the dance continued till daylight, with much speech-making and drinking of poteen. All fighting was steadily avoided at a wedding; for a quarrel would be considered a most unlucky omen. A wet day was also held to be very unlucky, as the bride would assuredly weep for sorrow throughout the year. But the bright warm sunshine was hailed joyfully, according to the old saying--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;"Happy is the bride that the sun shines on;<BR>
But blessed is the corpse that the rain rains on."</BLOCKQUOTE>
