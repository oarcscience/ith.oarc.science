The May Festival

> THERE were four great festivals held in Ireland from the most ancient
> pagan times, and these four sacred seasons were February, May,
> Midsummer, and November. May was the most memorable and auspicious of
> all; then the Druids lit the *Baal-Tinne,* the holy, goodly fire of
> Baal, the Sun-god, and they drove the cattle on a path made between
> two fires, and singed them with the flame of a lighted torch, and
> sometimes they cut them to spill blood, and then burnt, the blood as a
> sacred offering to the Sun-god.

> The great feast of Bel, or the Sun, took place on *May* Eve; and that
> of Samhain, or the Moon, on November Eve; when libations were poured
> out to appease the evil spirits, and also the spirits of the dead, who
> come out of their graves on that night to visit their ancient homes.

> The Phoenicians, it is known, adored the Supreme Being under the name
> of Bel-Samen, and it is remarkable that the peasants in lreland,
> wishing you good luck, say in Irish, "The blessing of Bel, and the
> blessing of Samhain, be with you," that is, of the sun and of the
> moon.

> These were the great festivals of the Druids, when all domestic fires
> were extinguished, in order to be re-lit by the sacred fire taken from
> the temples, for it was deemed sacrilege to have any fires kindled
> except from the holy altar flame.

> St. Patrick, however, determined to break down the power of the
> Druids; and, therefore, in defiance of their laws, he had a great fire
> lit on May Eve, when he celebrated the paschal mysteries; and
> henceforth Easter, or the Feast of the Resurrection, took the place of
> the Baal festival.

> The Baal fires were originally used for human sacrifices and
> burnt-offerings of the first-fruits of the cattle; but after
> Christianity was established the children and cattle were only passed
> between two fires for purification from sin, and as a safeguard
> against the power of the devil.

> The Persians also extinguished the domestic fires on the Baal
> festival, the 21st of April, and were obliged to re-light them from
> the temple fires, for which the priests were paid a fee in silver
> money. A fire kindled by rubbing two pieces of wood together was also
> considered lucky by the Persians; then water was boiled over the
> flame, and afterwards sprinkled on the people and on the cattle. The
> ancient Irish ritual resembles the Persian in every particular, and
> the Druids, no doubt, held the traditional worship exactly as brought
> from the East, the land of the sun and of tree worship and well
> worship.

> May Day, called in Irish *Là-Beltaine,* the day of the Baal fires, was
> the festival of greatest rejoicing held in Ireland. But the fairies
> have great power at that season, and children and cattle, and the milk
> and butter, must be well guarded from their influence. A spent coal
> must be put under the churn, and another under the cradle; and
> primroses must be scattered before the door, for the fairies cannot
> pass the flowers. Children that die in April are supposed to be
> carried off by the fairies, who are then always on the watch to abduct
> whatever is young and beautiful for their fairy homes.

> Sometimes on the 1st of May, a sacred heifer, snow white, appeared
> amongst the cattle; and this was considered to bring the highest good
> luck to the farmer. An old Irish song that alludes to the heifer, may
> be translated thus--

> "There is a cow on the mountain,  
> A fair white cow  
> She goes East and she goes West,  
> And my senses have gone for love of her  
> She goes with the sun and he forgets to burn,  
> And the moon turns her face with love to her,  
> My fair white cow of the mountain."

> The fairies are in the best of humours upon May Eve, and the music of
> the fairy pipes may be heard all through the night, while the fairy
> folk are dancing upon the rath. It is then they carry off the young
> people to join their revels; and if a girl has once danced to the
> fairy music, she will move ever after with such fascinating grace,
> that it has passed into a proverb to say of a good dancer, "She has
> danced to fairy music on the hill."

> At the great long dance held in old times on May Day, all the people
> held hands and danced round a great May-bush erected on a mound. The
> circle sometimes extended for a mile, the girls wearing garlands, and
> the young men carrying wands of green boughs, while the elder people
> sat round on the grass as spectators, and applauded the ceremony. The
> tallest and strongest young men in the county stood in the centre and
> directed the movements, while the pipers and harpers, wearing green
> and gold sashes, played the most spirited dance tunes.

> The oldest. worship of the world was of the sun and moon, of trees,
> wells, and the serpent that gave wisdom. Trees were the symbol of
> knowledge, and the dance round the May-bush is part of the ancient
> ophite ritual. The Baila also, or waltz, is associated with Baal
> worship, where the two circling motions are combined; the revolution
> of the planet on its own axis, and also round the Sun.

> In Italy, this ancient festival, called *Calendi Maggio,* is
> celebrated in the rural districts much in the Irish way. Dante fell in
> love at the great *May* Day festival, held in the Portinari Palace.
> The Sclavonic nations likewise light sacred fires, and dance round a
> tree hung with garlands on May Day. This reverence for the tree is one
> of the oldest superstitions of humanity and the most universal, and
> the fires are a relic of the old pagan worship paid to the Grynian
> Apollo--fire above all things being held sacred by the Irish as a
> safeguard from evil spirits. It is a saying amongst them, "Fire and
> salt are the two most sacred things given to man, and if you give them
> away on May Day, you give away your luck for the year." Therefore no
> one will allow milk, or fire, or salt, to be carried away from the
> house on that day; and if people came in and asked for a lighted sod,
> they would be driven away with curses, for their purpose was evil.

> The witches, however, make great efforts to steal the milk on May
> morning, and if they succeed, the luck passes from the family, and the
> milk and butter for the whole year will belong to the fairies. The
> best preventative is to scatter primroses on the threshold; and the
> old women tie bunches of primroses to the cows' tails, for the evil
> spirits cannot touch anything guarded by these flowers, if they are
> plucked before sunrise, not else. A piece of iron, also, made red hot,
> is placed upon the hearth; any old iron will do, the older the better,
> and branches of whitethorn and mountain ash are wreathed round the
> doorway for luck. The mountain ash has very great and mysterious
> qualities. If a branch of it be woven into the roof, that house is
> safe from fire for a year at least, and if a branch of it is mixed
> with the timber of a boat, no storm will upset it, and no man in it
> will be drowned for a twelvemonth certain. To save milk from
> witchcraft, the people on May morning cut and peel some branches of
> the mountain ash, and bind the twigs round the milk pails and the
> churn. No witch or fairy will then be able to steal the milk or
> butter. But all this must be done *before sunrise.* However, should
> butter be missed, follow the cow to the field, and gather the clay her
> hoof has touched; then, on returning home, place it under the churn
> with a live coal and a handful of salt, and your butter is safe from
> man or woman, fairy or fiend, for that year. There are other methods
> also to preserve a good supply of butter in the churn; a horse-shoe
> tied on it; a rusty nail from a coffin driven into the side: a cross
> made of the leaves of veronica placed at the bottom of the milk pail;
> but the mountain ash is the best of all safeguards against witchcraft
> and devil's magic. Without some of these precautions the fairies will
> certainly overlook the churn, and the milk and butter, in consequence,
> will fail all through the year, and the farmer suffer great loss.
> Herbs gathered on May Eve have a mystical and strong virtue for curing
> disease; and powerful potions are made then by the skilful herb women
> and fairy doctors, which no sickness can resist, chiefly of the
> yarrow, called in Irish "the herb of seven needs" or cures, from its
> many and great virtues. Divination is also practised to a great extent
> by means of the yarrow. The girls dance round it singing--

> "Yarrow, yarrow, yarrow,  
> I bid thee good morrow,  
> And tell me before to-morrow  
> Who my true love shall be."

> The herb is then placed under the head at night., and in dreams the
> true lover will appear. Another mode of divination for the future fate
> in life is by snails. The young girls go out early before sunrise to
> trace the path of the snails in the clay, for always a letter is
> marked, and this is the initial of the true lover's name. A black
> snail is very unlucky to meet first in the morning, for his trail
> would read *death;* but a white snail brings good fortune. A white
> lamb on the right hand is also good; but the cuckoo is ominous of
> evil. Of old the year began with the 1st of May, and an ancient Irish
> rhyme says--

> "A white lamb on my right side,  
> So will good come to me;  
> But not the little false cuckoo  
> On the first clay of the year."

> Prophecies were also made from the way the wind blew on May mornings.
> In '98 an old man, who was drawing near to his end and like to die,
> inquired from those around him--

> Where did you leave the wind last night?" (May Eve.)

> They told him it came from the north.

> "Then," he said, "the country is lost to the Clan Gael; our enemies
> will triumph had it been from the south, we should have had the
> victory; but now the Sassenach will trample us to dust." And he fell
> back and died.

> Ashes are often sprinkled on the threshold on May Eve; and if the
> print of a foot is found in the morning, turned inward, it be-tokens
> marriage; but if turned outward, death. On May Eve the fairy music is
> heard on all the hills, and many beautiful tunes have been caught up
> in this way by the people and the native musicians.

> About a hundred years ago a celebrated tune, called *Moraleana,* was
> learnt by a piper as he traversed the hills one evening; and he played
> it perfectly, note by note, as he heard it from the fairy pipes; on
> which a voice spoke to him and said that he would be allowed to play
> the tune *three times* in his life before all the people, but never a
> fourth, or a doom would fall on him. However, one day he had a great
> contest for supremacy with another piper, and at last, to make sure of
> victory, he played the wonderful fairy melody; when all the people
> applauded and declared he had won the prize by reason of its beauty,
> and that no music could equal his. So they crowned him with the
> garland; but at that moment he turned deadly pale, the pipes dropped
> from his hand, and he fell lifeless to the ground. For nothing escapes
> the fairies; they know all things, and their vengeance is swift and
> sure.

> It is very dangerous to sleep out in the open air in the month of May,
> for the fairies are very powerful then, and on the watch to carry off
> the handsome girls for fairy brides, and the young mothers as nurses
> for the fairy babies; while the young men are selected as husbands for
> the beautiful fairy princesses.

> A young man died suddenly on May Eve while he was lying asleep under a
> hay-rick, and the parents and friends knew immediately that he had
> been carried off to the fairy palace in the great moat of Granard. So
> a renowned fairy man was sent for, who promised to have him back in
> nine days. Meanwhile he desired that food and drink of time best
> should be left daily for the young man at a certain place on the moat.
> This was done, and time food always disappeared, by which they knew
> time young man was living, and came out of the moat nightly for the
> provisions left for him by his people.

> Now on the ninth day a great crowd assembled to see time young man
> brought back from Fairyland. And in time midst stood the fairy doctor
> performing his incantations by means of fire and a powder which he
> threw into the flames that caused a dense grey smoke to arise. Then,
> taking off his hat, and holding a key in his hand, he called out.
> three times in a loud voice, "Come forth, come forth, come forth!" On
> which a shrouded figure slowly rose up in time midst of the smoke, and
> a voice was heard answering, "Leave me in peace; I am happy with my
> fairy bride, and my parents need not weep for me, for I shall bring
> them good luck, and guard them from evil evermore."

> Then the figure vanished and the smoke cleared, and the parents were
> content, for they believed the vision, and having loaded the fairy-man
> with presents, they sent him away home.
