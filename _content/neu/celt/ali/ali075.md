The Hartpole Doom

> There is a tradition concerning the Hartpole family of Shrule Castle
> in the Queen's County (called the castle on the bloody stream, from
> the sanguinary deeds of the owner) that every male member of the
> family is doomed and fated to utter three screeches terrible to hear
> when dying. As to the origin of this doom the story goes that Sir
> Richard Hartpole about 300 years ago, in the time of the Elizabethan
> wars, committed many savage acts against the Irish, he being an
> upholder of the English faction.

> One day a priest, named O'More, having come to the castle on some
> friendly mission, the savage Hartpole ordered his retainers to seize
> him and hang him up in the courtyard.

> "Good God!" exclaimed the priest. "Give me at least a moment to pray!
> "

> "Go then," said Hartpole, "you may pray."

> The priest kneeled down apart from the crowd. But Hartpole grew
> impatient, and ordered him to rise.

> You have prayed long enough," he said, "prepare for death."

> And when the priest heard the order for his death, and saw the man
> approach to seize him, he swayed from right to left and gave three
> fearful screams.

> "Why do you screech?" asked the tyrant.

> "So shall you scream, and all your descendants in your last agony,"
> exclaimed O'More, "as a sign of the doom upon your race. You have
> murdered my people, you are now going to take my life; but I lay the
> curse of God on you and yours--your property shall pass away; your
> race shall perish off the earth; and by the three death screeches all
> men shall know that you and your posterity are accursed."

> The words of O'More only made the tyrant more furious, and the priest
> was hung at once in the courtyard before the eyes of Hartpole. But the
> prophecy of doom was fulfilled--the property perished, the castle
> became a ruin. The last Hartpole died miserably of want and hunger,
> and the whole race finally has become extinct.
