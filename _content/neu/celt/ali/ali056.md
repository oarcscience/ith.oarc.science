Whitsuntide

> Whitsuntide is a very fatal and unlucky time. Especially beware of
> water then, for there is an evil spirit in it, and no one should
> venture to bathe, nor to sail in a boat for fear of being drowned; nor
> to go a journey where water has to be crossed. And everything in the
> house must be sprinkled with holy water at Whitsuntide to keep away
> the fairies, who at that season are very active and malicious, and
> bewitch the cattle, and carry off the young children, and come up from
> the sea to hold strange midnight revels, when they kill with their
> fairy darts the unhappy mortal who crosses their path and pries at
> their mysteries.
