A Love Potion

> Some of the country people have still a traditional remembrance of
> very powerful herbal remedies, and love potions are even now
> frequently in use. They are generally prepared by an old woman; but
> must be administered by the person who wishes to inspire the tender
> passion. At the same time, to give a love potion is considered a very
> awful act, as the result may be fatal, or at least full of danger.

> A fine, handsome young man, of the best character and conduct,
> suddenly became wild and reckless, drunken and disorderly, from the
> effect, it was believed, of a love potion administered to him by a
> young girl who was passionately in love with him. When she saw the
> change produced in him by her act, she became moody and nervous, as if
> a constant terror were over her, and no one ever saw her smile again.
> Finally, she became half deranged, and after a few years of a strange,
> solitary life, she died of melancholy and despair. This was said to be
> "The Love-potion Curse."
