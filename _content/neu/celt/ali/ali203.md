St. John's Well

> AT St. John's well, County Cork, there is a large stone, believed to
> be the real true head of John the Baptist, grown hard and solid from
> time and the action of the elements. And the stone has certainly a
> rude resemblance to a human head.

> Suspected persons are brought to swear on it for a clearing from
> guilt; for it is held in high reverence. Compacts are also made there,
> which are held inviolate, for no one who swears with his hand on the
> stone, would ever dream of breaking the oath, and each person present
> as witness scratches a cross on the surface with a sharp piece of
> slate.

> A number of pagan remains are in the vicinity, but they are now held
> in reverence as places of Christian sanctity.

> Some time ago an ancient stone image was dug up from time earth, which
> antiquarians pronounced to be a pagan idol, probably the Irish Siva.
> This was at first consecrated as Saint Gobnath, but afterwards the
> priest destroyed the image with his own hands.

> All the paths round the well are marked deep by the lines of praying
> pilgrims who go round it on their knees. And there are piles of the
> little stones that mark the prayers of the penitents, all ready for
> the angels to count. Most of the stones are of pure quartz, white and
> glistening, and these are highly esteemed.
