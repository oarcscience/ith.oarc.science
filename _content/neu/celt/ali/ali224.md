The Ride with the Fairies

> THE fairies take great delight in horsemanship, and are splendid
> riders. Many fine young men are enticed to ride with them, when they
> dash alone with the fairies like the wind, Finvarra himself leading,
> on his great black horse with the red nostrils, that look like flames
> of fire. And ever after the young men are the most fearless riders in
> the country, so the people know at once that they have hunted with the
> fairies. And after the hunt some favourite of the party is taken to a
> magnificent supper in the fairy palace, and when he has drunk of the
> bright red wine they lull him to sleep with soft music. But never
> again can he find the fairy palace, and he looks in vain for the
> handsome horseman on his fine black steed, with all the gay young
> huntsmen in their green velvet dresses, who rushed over the field with
> him, like a flash of the storm wind. They have passed away for ever
> from his vision, like a dream of the night.

> Once on a time a gentleman, also one of the Kirwans of Galway, was
> riding by the fairy hill--where all the fairies of the West hold their
> councils and meetings, under the rule of Finvarra the king--when a
> strange horseman, mounted on a fiery black steed, suddenly appeared.
> But as the stranger bid him the time of day with distinguished grace,
> Mr. Kirwan returned his greeting courteously, and they rode on
> together side by side, discoursing pleasantly--for the stranger seemed
> to know every one and everything, though Mr. Kirwan could not remember
> ever having seen him before.

> "Now," said the black horseman, "I know that you are to be at the
> races to-morrow, so just let me give you a hint: if you wish to be
> certain of winning, allow me to send you my man to ride your horse. He
> never failed in a race yet, and he shall be with you early, before the
> start."

> With that, at a turn of the road, the stranger disappeared; for he was
> no other than Finvarra himself, who had a friendly liking for the
> tribe of the Kirwans, because all the men were generous who came of
> the blood, and all the women handsome.

> Next morning, as Mr. Kirwan was setting out for the race, his groom
> told him that a young jockey was waiting to see him. He was the
> strangest looking little imp, Mr. Kirwan thought, he had ever set eyes
> on, but he felt compelled to give him all the rights and power that
> was necessary for the race, and the young imp was off imp a moment,
> like a flash of lightning.

> Mr. Kirwan knew no more--he seemed like one in a dream--till the
> silver cup was handed to him as winner of the race, and
> congratulations poured down on him, and every one asked eagerly where
> he got the wonderful jockey who seemed to make the horse fly like the
> spirit of the wind itself. But the jockey by this time had
> disappeared. However, the stranger on the black horse was there, and
> he constrained Mr. Kirwan to come with him to dinner; and they rode on
> pleasantly, as before, till they reached a grand, beautiful house,
> with a crowd of gorgeous servants Waiting on the steps to receive the
> lord and master and his guest.

> One of them led Mr. Kirwan to his room to dress for dinner, and there
> he found a costly suit of violet velvet ready, in which the valet
> arrayed him. Then he entered the dininghall. It was all lit up
> splendidly, and there were garlands of flowers twining round crystal
> columns, and golden cups set with jewels for the wine, and golden
> dishes.

> The host seemed an accomplished man of the world, and did the honours
> with perfect grace. Conversation flowed freely, while soft music was
> heard at intervals from invisible players, and Mr. Kirwan could not
> resist the charm and beauty of the scene, nor the bright red wine that
> his host poured out for him into the jewelled cups.

> Then, when the banquet was over, a great crowd of ladies and gentlemen
> came in and danced to sweet low music, and they circled round the
> guest and tried to draw him into the dance. But when he looked at them
> it seemed to him that they were all the dead he had once known; for
> his own brother was there, that had been drowned in the lake a year
> before; and a man who had been killed by a fall when hunting; and
> others whose faces he knew well. And they were all pale as death, but
> their eyes burned like coals of fire.

> And as he looked and wondered, a lovely lady came over to him, wearing
> a necklace of pearls. And she clasped his wrist with her little hand,
> and tried to draw him into the circle.

> "Dance with me," she whispered, "dance with me again. Look at me, for
> you once loved me."

> And when he looked at her he knew that she was dead, and the clasp of
> her hand was like a ring of fire round his wrist; and he drew back in
> terror, for he saw that she was a beautiful girl he had loved in his
> youth, and to whom he had given a necklace of pearls, but who died
> before he could make her his bride.

> Then his heart sank with fear and dread, and he said to his host--

> "Take me from this place. I know the dancers; they are dead. Why have
> you brought them up from their graves?"

> But the host only laughed and said, ." You must take more wine to keep
> up your courage." And he poured him out a goblet of wine redder than
> rubies.

> And when he drank it, all the pageant and the music and the crowd
> faded away from before his eyes, and he fell into a profound sleep,
> and knew no more till he found himself at home, laid on his bed. And
> the servant told him that a strange horseman had accompanied him to
> the door late in the night, who had charged them to lay the master
> gently in his bed and by no means to awake him till noon next day, for
> he was weary after the race; and he bade them take the hunter to the
> stables and tend him carefully, for the animal was covered with foam,
> and all trembling.

> At noon Mr. Kirwan awoke, and rose up as well as ever: but of all the
> fairy revels nothing remained to him but the mark round his wrist of
> the clasp of a woman's hand, that seemed burned into his flesh.

> So he knew the night's adventure was no mere dream of the fancy, and
> the mark of the dead hand remained with him to his last hour, and the
> form of the young girl with her necklace of pearls often came before
> him in a vision of the night; but he never again visited the fairy
> palace, and never saw the dark horseman any more. As to the silver
> cup, he flung it into the lake, for he thought it had come to him by
> devil's magic and would bring no good luck to him or to his race. So
> it sank beneath the waves, and the silver cup was seen no more.
