The Beetle

> The beetle is not killed by the people for the following reason: they
> have a tradition that one day the chief priests sent messengers in
> every direction to look for the Lord Jesus, and they came to a field
> where a man was reaping, and asked him--

> "Did Jesus of Nazareth pass this way?"

> "No," said the man, "I have not seen him."

> "But I know better," said a little clock running up, "for He was here
> to-day and rested, and has not long gone away."

> "That is false," said a great big black. beetle, coming forward; "He
> has not passed since yesterday, and you will never find Him on this
> road; try another."

> So the people kill the clock because he tried to betray Christ; but
> they spare the beetle and will not touch him, because he saved the
> Lord on that day.
