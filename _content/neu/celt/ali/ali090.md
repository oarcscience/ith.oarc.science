Fairy Wiles

> The fairies are very desirous to abduct handsome cows and carry them
> off to time fairy palace under the earth; and if a farmer happens to
> find one of his stock ailing or diseased, the belief is that the
> fairies have carried off the real good animal, and sent an old wizened
> witch to take time form of the farmer's cow. It is therefore to
> neutralize the fairy spells that the cattle are driven through the
> fire on St. John's Eve; and other devices are employed--a bunch of
> primroses is very effective tied on the tail, or a hot coal run down
> the cow's back to singe the hair.

> One evening a boy was driving home his father's cows when a fairy
> blast arose in the form of a whirlwind of dust, on which the cows took
> fright, and one of them ran upon a fairy rath. The boy followed to
> turn her back, when he was met and stopped by an old witch-woman.

> "Let her alone, Alanna," she cried, "she is on our ground now, and you
> can't take her away. So just run home and tell your father that on
> this day twelve-month the cow will be restored to him, and bring a
> fine young calf along with her. But the fairies want her badly now,
> for our beautiful queen down there is fretting her life out for want
> of some milk that has the scent of the green grass in it and of the
> fresh upper air. Now don't fret, Alanna, but trust my words. There,
> take you hazel stick and strike the cow boldly three times on the
> head, that so the way may be clear we have to travel."

> With that the boy struck the animal as he was desired, for the old
> witch-woman was so nice and civil that he liked to oblige her, timid
> immediately after she and the cow vanished away as if they had sunk
> into the earth.

> However, the father minded the time, and when that day year came round
> he sent his son to the fairy rath to see if the witch had kept her
> promise, and there truly was the cow standing quite patiently, and a
> fine white calf by her side. So there were great rejoicings when he
> brought them home, for the fairies had kept their promise and behaved
> honourably, as indeed they always do when properly treated and
> trusted.

> \*

> Not but that the fairies will do wicked things sometimes, and, above
> all, steal the milk when they get a chance, or skim the cream off the
> milk crocks.

> A farmer had a fine cow that was the pride of his farm and gave
> splendid milk, but suddenly the animal seemed ailing and queer; for
> she gave no milk, but went every morning and stood under the old
> hawthorn-tree quite quietly as if some one were milking her.

> So the man watched the place at milking time, and as usual down the
> field came the cow and took up her position close under the old
> hawthorn. Then the farmer beheld the trunk of the tree open, and out
> of the cleft came a little witch-woman all in red, who milked the cow
> in a vessel she had with her, and then she retreated into the tree
> again.

> Here was devil's work in earnest, so thought the farmer, and he
> hastened off for the greatest fairy doctor in the country. And when he
> came the cow was singed all along its back with a live coal; and then
> an incantation was said over it, but no one heard the words the fairy
> doctor uttered; after this he gave the animal a strong potion to
> drink, but no one knew the herbs of which it was made. However, the
> next day the cow was quite restored, and gave her milk as heretofore,
> and the spell was broken for ever and ever, after they had drawn a
> circle round the old hawthorn-tree with a red-hot piece of iron taken
> from the hearth; for neither witch nor fairy can pass a circle of
> fire.
