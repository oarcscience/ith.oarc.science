The Lady Witch

> ABOUT a hundred years ago there lived a woman in Joyce County, of whom
> all the neighbours were afraid, for she had always plenty of money,
> though no one knew how she came by it; and the best of eating and
> drinking went on at her house, chiefly at night--meat and fowls and
> Spanish wines in plenty for all comers. And when people asked how it
> all came, she laughed and said, "I have paid for it," but would tell
> them no more.

> So the word went through the county that she had sold herself to the
> Evil One, and could have everything she wanted by merely wishing and
> willing, and because of her riches they called her "The Lady Witch."

> She never went out but at night, and then always with a bridle and
> whip in her hand; and the sound of a horse galloping was heard often
> far on in the night along the roads near her house.

> Then a strange story was whispered about, that if a young man drank of
> her Spanish wines at supper and afterwards fell asleep, she would
> throw the bridle over him and change him to a horse, and ride him all
> over the country, and whatever she touched with her whip became hers.
> Fowls, or butter, or wines, or the new-made cakes--she had but to wish
> and will and they were carried by spirit hands to her house, and laid
> in her larder. Then when the ride was done, and she had gathered
> enough through the country of all she wanted, she took the bridle off
> the young man, and he came back to his own shape and fell asleep; and
> when he awoke he had no knowledge of all that had happened, and the
> Lady Witch bade him come again and drink of her Spanish wines as often
> as it pleased him.

> Now there was a fine brave young fellow in the neighbourhood, and he
> determined to make out the truth of the story. So be often went back
> and forwards, and made friends with the Lady Witch, and sat down to
> talk to her, but always on the watch. And she took a great fancy to
> him and told him he must come to supper some night, and she would give
> him the best of everything, and he must taste her Spanish wine.

> So she named the night, and he went gladly, for he was filled with
> curiosity. And when he arrived there was a beautiful supper laid, and
> plenty of wine to drink and he ate and drank, but was cautious about
> the wine, and spilled it on the ground from his glass when her head
> was turned away. Then he pretended to be very sleepy, and she said--

> "My son, you are weary. He down there on the bench and sleep, for the
> night is far spent, and you are far from your home."

> So he lay down as if he were quite dead with sleep, and closed his
> eyes, but watched her all the time.

> And she came over in a little while and looked at him steadily, but he
> never stirred, only breathed the more heavily.

> Then she went softly and took the bridle from the wall, and stole over
> to fling it over his head; but he started up, and, seizing, the
> bridle, threw it over the woman, who was immediately changed into a
> spanking grey mare. And he led her out and jumped on her back and rode
> away as fast. as the wind till he came to the forge.

> "Ho, smith," he cried, "rise up and shoe my mare, for she is weary
> after the journey."

> And the smith got up and did his work as he was bid, well and strong.
> Then the young man mounted again, and rode back like the wind to the
> house of the Witch; and there he took off the bridle, and she
> immediately regained her own form, and sank down in a deep sleep.

> But as the shoes had been put on at the forge without saying the
> proper form of words, they remained on her hands and feet, and no
> power on earth could remove them.

> So she never rose from her bed again, and died not long after of grief
> and shame. And not one in the whole country would follow the coffin of
> the Lady Witch to the grave; and the bridle was burned with fire, and
> of all her riches nothing was left but a handful of ashes, and this
> was flung to the four points of earth and the four winds of heaven; so
> the enchantment was broken and the power of the Evil One ended.
