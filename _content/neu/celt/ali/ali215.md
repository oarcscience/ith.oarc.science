A Sacred Island

> AT Toome Island there is the ruin of an ancient church, where the dead
> walk on November Eve. It is a solemn and sacred place, and nothing is
> allowed to be taken from it; neither stone nor branch of the shadowing
> trees, for fear of angering the spirits. One day three men who were on
> the island cut down some branches of an elder-tree that grew there to
> repair a private still, and carried them off in their boat; but when
> just close to the shore a violent gust of wind upset the boat, and the
> men were drowned. The wood, however, floated back to the island, and a
> cross was made of it which was erected on the beach, to commemorate
> the fate of the doomed men.

> It is recorded, also, that a certain stone having been taken away by
> some masons from the ancient ruin, to build into the wall of the
> parish church, which they were erecting in the place, the water in the
> town well suddenly began to diminish, and at last dried up, to the
> great consternation and terror of the inhabitants, who were at their
> wits' end to know the cause; when luckily an old woman of the place
> dreamed a dream about the abduction of the stone, which gave the
> solution of the mystery.

> At once the people took the matter into their own hands, and they went
> in a body and cast down the wall till they came on the stone, which
> was then placed in a boat, and carried back with solemn ceremonial to
> the island, where it was replaced in its original site, and,
> immediately after, the water flowed back again into the well, and the
> supply became even more copious than ever.
