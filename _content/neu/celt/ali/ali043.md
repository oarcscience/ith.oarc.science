The Fairy Changeling

> ONE evening, a man was coming home late, and he passed a house where
> two women stood by a window, talking.

> "I have left the dead child, in the cradle as you bid me," said one
> woman, "and behold here is the other child, take it and let me go;"
> and she laid down an infant on a sheet by the window, who seemed in a
> secret sleep, and it was draped all in white.

> "Wait," said the other, "till you have had some food, and then take it
> to the fairy queen, as I promised, in place of the dead child that we
> have laid in the cradle by the nurse. 'Wait also till the moon rises,
> and then you shall have the payment which I promised."

> They then both turned from the window. Now the man saw that there was
> some devil's magic in it all. And when the women turned away he crept
> up close to the open window and put his hand in and seized the
> sleeping child and drew it out quietly without ever a sound. Then he
> made off as fast as he could to his own home, before the women could
> know anything about it, and handed the child to his mother's care. Now
> the mother was angry at first, but when he told her the story, she
> believed him, and put the baby to sleep--a lovely, beautiful boy with
> a face like an angel.

> Next morning there was a great commotion in the village, for the news
> spread that the first-born son of the great lord of the place, a
> lovely, healthy child, died suddenly in the night, without ever having
> had a sign of sickness. When they looked at him in the morning, there
> he laid dead in his cradle, and he was shrunk and wizened like a
> little old man, and no beauty was seen on him any more. So great
> lamentation was heard on all sides, and the whole country gathered to
> the wake. Amongst them came the young man who had carried off the
> child, and when he looked on the little wizened thing in the cradle he
> laughed. Now the parents were angry at his laughter, and wanted to
> turn him out.

> But he said, "Wait put down a good fire," and they did so.

> Then he went over to the cradle and said to the hideous little
> creature, in a loud voice before all the people--

> "If you don't rise up this minute and leave the place, I will burn you
> on the fire; for I know might well who you are, and where you came
> from."

> At once the child sat up and began to grin at him; and made a rush to
> the door to get away; but the man caught hold of it and threw it on
> the fire. And the moment it felt the heat it turned into a black
> kitten, and flew up the chimney and was seen no more.

> Then the man sent word to his mother to bring the other child, who was
> found to be the true heir, the lord's own son. So there was great
> rejoicing, and the child grew up to be a great lord him-self, and when
> his time came, he ruled well over the estate; and his descendants are
> living to this day, for all things prospered with him after he was
> saved from the fairies.
