The Clearing from Guilt

> To prove innocence of a crime a certain ancient form is gone through,
> which the people look on with great awe, and call it emphatically--"
> The Clearing." It is a fearful ordeal, and instances are known of men
> who have died of fear and trembling from having passed through the
> terrors of the trial, even if innocent. And it is equally terrible for
> the accuser as well as the accused.

> On a certain day fixed for the ordeal the accused goes to the
> churchyard and carries away a skull. Then, wrapped in a white sheet,
> and bearing the skull in his hand, he proceeds to the house of the
> accuser, where a great crowd has assembled; for the news of "A
> Clearing" spreads like wildfire, and all the people gather together as
> witnesses of the ceremony. There, before the house of his accuser, he
> kneels down on his bare knees, makes the sign of the cross on his
> face, kisses the skull, and prays for some time in silence; the people
> also wait in silence, filled with awe and dread, not knowing what the
> result may be. Then the accuser, pale and trembling, comes forward and
> stands beside the kneeling man; and with uplifted hand adjures him to
> speak the truth. On which the accused, still kneeling and holding the
> skull in his hand, utters the most fearful imprecation known in the
> Irish language; almost as terrible as that curse of the Druids, which
> is so awful that it never yet was put into English words. The accused
> prays that if he fail to speak the truth all the sins of the man whose
> skull he holds may be laid upon his soul, and all the sins of his
> forefathers back to Adam, and all the punishment due to them for the
> evil of their lives, and all their weakness and sorrow both of body
> and soul be laid on him both in this life and in the life to come for
> evermore. But if the accuser has accused falsely and out of malice,
> then may all the evil rest on his head through this life for ever, and
> may his soul perish everlastingly.

> It would be impossible to describe adequately the awe with which the
> assembled people listen to these terrible words, and the dreadful
> silence of the crowd as they wait to see the result. If nothing
> happens the man rises from his knees after an interval, and is
> pronounced innocent by the judgment of the people, and no word is ever
> again uttered against him, nor is he shunned or slighted by the
> neighbours. But the accuser is looked on with fear and dislike, he is
> considered unlucky, and seeing that his life is often made so
> miserable by the coldness and suspicion of the people, many would
> rather suffer wrong than force the accused person to undergo so
> terrible a trial as "The Clearing."
