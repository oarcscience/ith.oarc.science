The Farmer's Wife

> DOWN in the South there lived another rich farmer and his wife, who
> were both of them hated by the people for their stingy, hard-hearted
> ways. Never a word of kindness was on their lips, and never a blessing
> from the poor was invoked on their heads.

> One day an old woman came to the door to beg a little food--a cake
> from the griddle, or a few potatoes, or a handful of meal; but she was
> harshly refused by the farmer's wife and turned away.

> Then she came back in a little while, and begged for a drink of milk,
> for she was faint and weary, she said, and had travelled far. This was
> also refused, and she was ordered to leave the place at once. But the
> woman still begged hard for leave to rest herself a little, and for
> even a drink of butter milk, for it was churning day and she knew
> there must be plenty in the house. Then the farmer's wife grew very
> angry, and said she would turn the dogs on her if she didn't go away,
> and that no tramp should get anything from her. On this the woman
> muttered some words, with her hand on the lintel of the door, and then
> went her way. Soon after, being much heated by the violence of her
> anger, the farmer's wife went to the dairy for a drink; but as she
> poured out the draught she saw something black in the cup, and she
> tried to take it out with her finger, but it always escaped her. Then,
> being very thirsty, she drank off the milk, and still another and
> another cup, and in the drinking the black object disappeared. That
> night, however, she felt nigh to death, for her body began to swell,
> and turned black all over. Medical aid was sent for, but the doctor
> could make out nothing of the cause or nature of the strange disease.
> Then the priest was summoned, and he at once, having heard the story,
> said there was witchcraft in it; and he proceeded to pray, and to
> exorcise the evil spirit in the woman. Besides this he made her be
> placed in a hot bath, into which he poured some holy water.

> At first the woman uttered fierce cries, and said her body seemed rent
> and torn; but gradually she became calmer, and the blackness slowly
> went down from head to feet, and finally disappeared, leaving the body
> fair and whole, all except one hand, and this remained still as black
> as ink. The holy water was poured on it, and the priest prayed, but
> nothing would remove the devil's mark.

> So the priest told her at last that the blackness would remain as a
> sign and token of her sins against the poor; and from that day forth
> to her death the mark of the evil spell remained on her, but she grew
> kinder to the poor, for her heart was shaken by terror. And when she
> came to die there was no blackness on her hand, for the tears of the
> poor she had succoured and befriended had washed all the devil's mark
> away, before the moment came when her soul was to appear before God.
