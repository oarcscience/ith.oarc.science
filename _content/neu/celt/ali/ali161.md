Dreams

> Never tell your dreams fasting, and always tell them first to a woman
> called Mary.

> To dream of a hearse with white plumes is a wedding; but to dream of a
> wedding is grief, and death will follow.

> To dream of a woman kissing you is deceit; but of a man, friendship;
> and to dream of a horse is exceedingly lucky.

> To dream of a priest is bad; even to dream of the devil is better.
> Remember, also, either a present or a purchase from a priest is
> unlucky.
