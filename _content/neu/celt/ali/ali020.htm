<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Midnight Ride</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A Peasant's Tale</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ONE evening a man called Shawn Ruadh was out looking for a red cow that had strayed away, when he heard voices round him, and one said "Get me a horse," and another cried "Get me a horse."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And get me a horse, too," said Shawn, "since they seem so plenty, for I'd like a ride along with you," and with that he found himself on the instant mounted on a fine grey horse beside another man who rode a black horse. And they rode away and away till they came to a great city.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Now, do you know where you are?" said the black horseman. "You are in London, and whatever you want you can have."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Thank you kindly, my friend," said the other, "so, with your leave, I'll just have a good suit of clothes, for I'm much in want of that same. Can I have them?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"By all means," said the black horseman; "there, go into that merchant's shop and ask for what you like, and if he refuses just throw the stone I give you on the floor and the whole place will seem on fire. But don't be frightened; only wait your good luck."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So Shawn went into the biggest shop there, and he spoke to the merchant quite stiff and proud.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Show me the best suit of clothes you have," said he. "Never mind the price, that's of no consequence, only be very particular as to the fit."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the shopman laughed aloud.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"We don't make clothes for beggars like you," he said. "Be off out of this."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then Shawn threw down the stone on the floor, and immediately the whole place seemed on fire, and the merchant. ran out himself and all the shopmen after him to get pails of water, and Shawn laughed when he saw them all drenched.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Now what will you give me," said he, "if I put out the fire for you?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"You shall have the price of the best suit of clothes in the shop," answered the merchant, "all paid down in gold; only help me to put out the fire."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So Shawn stooped down and picked up the stone, and put it quietly into his pocket, and instantly all the flames disappeared: and the merchant was so grateful that he paid him down all the gold for the clothes, and more. And Shawn bid him good-night, and mounted the grey steed again quite happy in himself.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Now," said the black horseman, "is there anything else you, desire? for it is near ten o'clock, and we must be back by midnight; so just say what you would like to do."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Well," said Shawn Ruadh, "I would like of all things to see the Pope of Rome, for two of our priests are disputing as to who is to get the parish, and I want Father M'Grath to have it, for I have a great opinion of him, and if I ask his holiness he'll settle it all in no time and for ever."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Come then," said the black horseman; "it is a long way to Rome, certainly, but I think we'll manage it in the two hours, and be back before twelve o'clock."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So away thev rode like the wind, and in no the Shawn found himself before the great palace of the Pope; and all the grand servants with gold sticks in their hands stared at him, and asked him what he wanted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Just go in," said he," and tell his Holiness, that Shawn Ruadh, all the way from Ireland, is here and wants to see him very particularly."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But the servants laughed, and struck him with their gold sticks and hunted him away from the gate. Now the Pope hearing the rout looked out of the window, and seeing Shawn Ruadh he came down and asked him what he wanted.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Just this, your holiness," answered Shawn, "I want a letter on behalf of Father M'Grath bidding the Bishop give him the parish, and I'll wait till your Holiness writes it; and meanwhile let me have a little supper, for it's hungry I am after my long ride."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then the Pope laughed, and told the servants to drive the fellow away, for he was evidently out of his wits.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So Shawn grew angry, and flung down the stone on the floor, and instantly all the palace seemed on fire, and the Pope ordered the grand servants to go for water; and they had to run about like mad getting pails and jugs of water, whatever they could lay bands on; and all their fine clothes were spoiled, and the beautiful gold sticks were flung away in their fright, while they took the jugs and splashed and dashed the water over each other.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now it was Shawn's turn to laugh till his sides ached, but his holiness looked very grave.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Well," said Shawn, "if I put out the fire what will you do for me? Will you write that letter?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Ay, I will," said the Pope, "and you shall have your supper also; only help us to put out the fire, my fine fellow."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So Shawn quietly put the stone back in his pocket, and instantly all the flames disappeared.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Now," said the Pope, "you shall have supper of the best in the palace; and I'll write a letter to the Bishop ordering him to give Father M'Grath the parish. And here, besides, is a purse of gold for yourself, and take it with my blessing."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then he ordered all the grand servants to get supper for the excellent young man from Ireland, and to make him comfortable. So Shawn was mightily pleased, and ate and drank like a prince. Then he mounted his grey steed again, and just as midnight struck he found himself at his own door, but all alone; for the grey steed and the black horseman had both vanished. But there stood his wife crying her eyes out and in great trouble.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O Shawn, Agra! I thought you were dead or that evil had fallen on you."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Not a bit of it," said Shawn, "I've been supping with the Pope of Rome, and look here at all the gold I've brought home for you, my darlint."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And he put his hand in his pocket to get the purse; but ho! there was nothing there except a rough, grey stone. And from that hour to this his wife believes that he dreamed the whole story as he lay under the hay-rick, on his way home from a carouse with the boys.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, Father M'Grath got the parish, and Shawn took good care to tell him how ime had spoken up boldly for him to the Pope of Rome, and made his holiness write the letter to the Bishop about him. And Father M'Grath was a nice gentleman, and he smiled and told Shawn he thanked him kindly for his good word.</BLOCKQUOTE>
