<CENTER><H1>Chapter VII: The Voyage of Maldun</H1></CENTER>
<P>
BESIDES the legends which cluster round great heroic names, and
have, or at least pretend to have, the character of history, there are many
others, great and small, which tell of adventures lying purely in regions of
romance) and out of earthly space and time. As a specimen of these I give here a
summary of the &quot;Voyage of Maeldun,&quot; a most curious and brilliant piece
of invention, which is found in the manuscript entitled the &quot;Book of the
Dun Cow&quot; (about 1100) and other early sources, and edited, with a
translation (to which I owe the following extracts), by Dr. Whitley Stokes in
the &quot; Revue Celtique&quot; for 1888 and 1889. It is only one of a number of
such wonder-voyages found in ancient Irish literature, but it is believed to
have been the earliest of them all and model for the rest, and it has had the
distinction, in the abridged and modified form given by Joyce in his &quot;Old
Celtic Romances,&quot; of having furnished the theme for the &quot;Voyage of
Maeldune ' to Tennyson, who made it into a wonderful creation of rhythm and
colour, embodying a kind of allegory of Irish history. It will be noticed at the
end that we are in the unusual position of knowing the name of the author of
this piece of primitive literature, though he does not claim to have composed,
but only to have &quot;put in order,&quot; the incidents of the
&quot;Voyage.&quot; Unfortunately we cannot tell when he lived, but the tale as
we have it probably dates from the ninth century. Its atmosphere is entirely
Christian, and it has no mythological significance except in so far as it
teaches the lesson that the oracular injunctions of wizards should be obeyed. No
adventure or even detail, of importance is omitted in</P>

<P>
[309]</P>

<P>
the following summary of the story, which is given thus fully
because the reader may take it as representing a large and important section of
Irish legendary romance. Apart from the source to which I am indebted, the
&quot;Revue Celtique,&quot; I know no other faithful reproduction in English of
this wonderful tale.</P>

<P>
The &quot;Voyage of Maeldun&quot; begins, as Irish tales often
do, by telling us of the conception of its hero.</P>

<P>
There was a famous man of the sept of the Owens of Aran, named
Ailill Edge-of-Battle, who went with his king on a foray into another territory.
They encamped one night near a church and convent of nuns. At midnight Ailill,
who was near the church, saw a certain nun come out to strike the bell for
nocturns, and caught her by the hand. In ancient Ireland religious persons were
not much respected in time of war, and Ailill did not respect her. When they
parted, she said to him: &quot;Whence is thy race, and what is thy name ?&quot;
Said the hero : &quot;Ailill of the Edge-of~Battle's my name, and I am of the
Owenacht of Aaan, in Thomond.&quot;</P>

<P>
Not long afterwards Ailill was slain by reavers from Leix; who
burned the church of Doocloone over his head.</P>

<P>
In due time a son was born to the woman and she called his name
Maeldun. He was taken secretly to her friend, the queen of the territory, and by
her Maeldun was reared. &quot;Beautiful indeed was his form, and it is doubtful
if there hath been in flesh any one so beautiful as he. So he grew up till he
was a young warrior and fit to use weapons. Great, then was his brightness and
his gaiety and his playfulness. In his play he outwent all his comrades in
throwing balls, and in runnig and leaping and putting stones and racing
horses.&quot;</P>

<P>
One day a proud young warrior who had been</P>

<P>
[310]</P>

<P>
defeated by him taunted him with his lack of knowledge of his
kindred and descent. Maeldun went to his foster-mother, the queen, and said :
&quot;I will not eat nor drink till thou tell me who are my mother and my
father.&quot; &quot;I am thy mother,&quot; said the queen, &quot;for none ever
loved her son more than I love thee.&quot; But Maeldun insisted on knowing all,
and the queen at last took him to his own mother, the nun, who told him:
&quot;Thy father was Ailill of the Owens of Aran.&quot; Then Maeldun went to his
own kindred, and was well received by them ; and with him he took as guests his
three beloved foster-brothers, sons of the king and queen who had brought him
up.</P>

<P>
After a time Maeldun happened to be among a company of young
warriors who were contending at putting the stone in the graveyard of the ruined
church of Doocloone. Maeldun's foot was planted, as he heaved the stone, on a
scorched and blackened flagstone; and one who was by, a monk named Briccne,
[here we have evidently a reminiscence of Briccriu of the Poisoned Tongue, the
mischief-maker of the Ultonians] said to him : &quot;It were better for thee to
avenge the man who was burnt there than to cast stones over his burnt
bones.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Who was that?&quot; asked Maeldun.</P>

<P>
&quot;Ailill, thy father,&quot; they told him.</P>

<P>
&quot;Who slew him?&quot; said he.</P>

<P>
&quot;Reavers from Leix,&quot; they said, &quot;and they
destroyed him on this spot.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then Maeldun threw down the stone he was about to cast, and put
his mantle round him and went home; and he asked the way to Leix. They told him
he could only go there by sea. [the Arans are three islands at the entrance of
Galway Bay. They are a perfect museum of mysterious ruins,]</P>

<P>
[311]</P>

<P>
At the advice of a Druid he then built him a boat, or coracle,
of skins lapped threefold one over the other; and the wizard also told him that
seventeen men only must accompany him, and on what day he must begin the boat
and on what day he must put out to sea.</P>

<P>
So when his company was ready he put out and hoisted the sail,
but had gone only a little way when his three foster-brothers came down to the
beach and entreated him to take them. &quot;Get you home,&quot; said Maeldun,
&quot;for none but the number I have may go with me.&quot; But the three youths
would not be separated from Maeldun, and they flung themselves into the sea. He
turned back, lest they should be drowned, and brought them into his boat. All,
as we shall see, were punished for this transgression, and Maeldun condemned to
wandering until expiation had been made.</P>

<P>
Irish bardic tales excel in their openings. In this case, as
usual, the <I>mise-en-sc&#232;ne </I>is admirably contrived. The narrative which
follows tells how, after seeing his father's slayer on an island, but being
unable to land there, Maeldun and his party are blown out to sea, where they
visit a great number of islands and have many strange adventures on them. The
tale becomes, in fact, a <I>cento </I>of stories and incidents, some not very
interesting, while in others, as in the adventure of the Island of the Silver
Pillar, or the Island of the Flaming Rampart, or that where the episode of the
eagle takes place, the Celtic sense of beauty, romance, and mystery find an
expression unsurpassed, perhaps, in literature.</P>

<P>
In the following rendering I have omitted the verses given by
Joyce at the end of each adventure. They merely recapitulate the prose
narrative, and are not found in the earliest manuscript authorities.</P>

<P>
[312]</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

The Island of the Slayer</P>

</B>
<P>
Maeldun and his crew had rowed<I> </I>all day and half the night
when they came to two small bare islands with two forts in them, and a noise was
heard from them of armed men quarrelling. &quot;Stand off from me, cried one of
them, &quot;for I am a better man than thou. 'Twas I slew Ailill of the
Edge-of-Battle and burned the church of Doocloone over him, and no kinsman has
avenged his death on me. And <I>thou </I>hast never done the like of that.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then Maeldun was about to land, and German [pronounced
&quot;Ghermawn &quot; - the &quot;G&quot; hard] and Diuran the Rhymer cried that
God had guided them to the spot where they would be. But a great wind arose
suddenly and blew them off into the boundless ocean, and Maeldun said to his
foster-brothers : &quot;Ye have caused this to be, casting yourselves on board
in spite of the words of the Druid.&quot; And they had no answer, save only to
be silent for a little space.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Ants</P>

</B>
<P>
They drifted three days and three nights, not knowing whither to
row, when at the dawn of the third day they heard the noise of breakers, and
came to an island as soon as the sun was up. Here, ere they could land, they met
a swarm of ferocious ants, each the size of a foal, that came down the strand
and into the sea to get at them ; so they made off quickly, and saw no land for
three days more.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Great Birds</P>

</B>
<P>
This was a terraced island, with trees all round it, and great
birds sitting on the trees. Maeldun landed first alone, and care fully searched
the island for any</P>

<P>
[313]</P>

<P>
evil thing, but finding none, the rest followed him, and killed
and ate many of the birds, bringing others on board their boat.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Fierce Beast</P>

</B>
<P>
A great sandy island was this, and on it a beast like a horse,
but with clawed feet like a hound's. He flew at them to devour them, but they
put off in time, and were pelted by the beast with pebbles from the shore as
they rowed away.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Giant Horses</P>

</B>
<P>
A great, flat island, which it fell by lot to German and Diuran
to explore first. They found a vast green racecourse, on which were the marks of
horses' hoofs, each as big as the sail of a ship, and the shells of nuts of
monstrous size were lying about, and much plunder. So they were afraid, and took
ship hastily again, and from the sea they saw a horse-race in progress and heard
the shouting of a great multitude cheering on the white horse or the brown, and
saw the giant horses running swifter than the wind. [Horse-racing was a<I> </I>particular
delight to the ancient Irish, and ii mentioned in a ninth-century poem in praise
of May as one of the attractions of that month. The name of the month of May
given in an ancient Gaulish calendar means &quot;the month of
horse-racing.&quot;] So they rowed away with all their might, thinking they had
come upon an assembly of demons.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Stone Door</P>

</B>
<P>
A full week passed, and then they found a great, high island
with a house standing on the shore. A door with a valve of stone opened into the
sea, and through it the sea-waves kept hurling salmon into the house. Maeldun
and his party entered, and found the house</P>

<P>
[314]</P>

<P>
empty of folk, but a great<I> </I>bed lay ready for the chief to
whom it belonged, and a bed for each three of his company, and meat and drink
beside each bed. Maeldun and his party ate and drank their fill, and then sailed
off again.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Apples</P>

</B>
<P>
By the time they had come here they had been a long time
voyaging, and food had failed them, and they were hungry. This island had
precipitous sides from which a wood hung down, and as they passed along the
cliffs Maeldun broke off a twig and held it in his hand. Three days and nights
they coasted the cliff and found no entrance to the island, but by that time a
cluster of three apples had grown on the end of Maeldun's rod, and each apple
sufficed the crew for forty days.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Wondrous Beast</P>

</B>
<P>
This island had a fence of stone round it, and within the fence
a huge beast that raced round and round the island. And anon it went to the top
of the island, and then performed a marvellous feat, viz., it turned its body
round and round inside its skin, the skin remaining unmoved, while again it
would revolve its skin round and round the body. When it saw the party it rushed
at them, but they escaped, pelted with stones as they rowed away. One of the
stones pierced through Maeldun': shield and lodged in the keel of the boat.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Biting Horses</P>

</B>
<P>
Here were many great beasts resembling horses, that tore
continually pieces of flesh from each other's sides, So that all the island ran
with blood. They rowed hastily away, and were now disheartened and full of</P>

<P>
[315]</P>

<P>
complaints, for they knew not where they were, nor how to find
guidance or aid in their quest.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Fiery Swine</P>

</B>
<P>
With great weariness, hunger, and thirst they arrived at the
tenth island, which was full of trees loaded with golden apples. Under the trees
went red beasts, like fiery swine, that kicked the trees with their legs, when
the apples fell and the beasts consumed them. The beasts came out at morning
only, when a multitude of birds left the island, and swam out to sea till nones,
when they turned and swam inward again till vespers, and ate the apples all
night.</P>

<P>
Maeldun and his comrades landed at night, and felt the soil hot
under their feet from the fiery swine in their caverns underground. They
collected all the apples they could, which were good both against hunger and
thirst, and loaded their boat with them and put to sea once more, refreshed.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Little Cat</P>

</B>
<P>
The apples had failed them when they came hungry and thirsting
to the eleventh island. This was, as it were, a tall white tower of chalk
reaching up to the clouds, and on the rampart about it were great houses white
as snow. They entered the largest of them, and found no man in it, but a small
cat playing on four stone pillars which were in the midst of the house, leaping
from one to the other. It looked a little on the Irish warriors, but did not
cease from its play. On the walls of the houses there were three rows of objects
hanging up one row of brooches of gold and silver, and one of' neck-torques of
gold and silver, each as big as the hoop of a cask, and one of great swords with
gold and silver hilts. Quilts and shining garments lay in the</P>

<P>
[316]</P>

<P>
room, and there, also, were a roasted ox and a flitch of bacon
and abundance of liquor. &quot;Hath this been left for us?&quot; said Maeldun to
the cat. It looked at him a moment, and then continued its play. So there they
ate and drank and slept, and stored up what remained of the food. Next day, as
they made to leave the house, the youngest of Maeldun's foster-brothers took a
necklace from the wall, and was bearing it out when the cat suddenly
&quot;leaped through him like a fiery arrow,&quot; and he fell, a heap of ashes,
on the floor. Thereupon Maeldun, who had forbidden the theft of the jewel,
soothed the cat and replaced the necklace, and they strewed the ashes of the
dead youth on the sea-shore, and put to sea again.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Black and the White Sheep</P>

</B>
<P>
This had a brazen palisade dividing it in two, and a flock of
black sheep on one side and of white sheep on the other. Between them was a big
man who tended the flocks, and sometimes he put a white sheep among the black,
when it became black at once, or a black sheep among the white, when it
immediately turned white. [the same phenomenon is recorded as being witnessed by
Peredur in the Welsh tale of that name in the &quot;Mabinogion,&quot;] By way of
an experiment Maeldun flung a peeled white wand on the side of the black sheep.
It at once turned black, whereat they left the place in terror, and without
landing.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Giant Cattle</P>

</B>
<P>
A great and wide island with a herd of huge swine on it. They
killed a small pig and roasted it on the spot, as it was too great to carry on
board. The island rose up into a very high mountain, and Diuran and German went
to view the country from the top of it.</P>

<P>
[317]</P>

<P>
On their way they met a broad river. To try the depth of the
water German dipped in the haft of his spear, which at once was consumed as with
liquid fire. On the other bank was a huge man guarding what seemed a herd of
oxen. He called to them not to disturb the calves, so they went no further and
speedily sailed away.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Mill</P>

</B>
<P>
Here they found a great and grim-looking mill, and a giant
miller grinding corn in it. &quot;Half the corn of your country, he said,
&quot;is ground here. Here comes to be ground all that men begrudge to each
other.&quot; Heavy and many were the loads they saw going to it, and all that
was ground in it was carried away west wards. So they crossed themselves and
sailed away.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Black Mourners</P>

</B>
<P>
An island full of black people continually weeping and
lamenting. One of the two remaining foster-brothers landed on it, and
immediately turned black and fell to weeping like the rest. Two others went to
fetch him; the same fate befell them. Four others then went with their heads
wrapped in cloths, that they should not look on the land or breathe the air of
the place, and they seized two of the lost ones and brought them away perforce,
but not the foster-brother. The two rescued ones could not explain their conduct
except by saying that they had to do as they saw others doing about them.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Four Fences</P>

</B>
<P>
Four fences of gold, silver, brass, and crystal divided this
island into our parts, kings in one, queens in another, warriors in a third,
maidens in the fourth.</P>

<P>
[318]</P>

<P>
On landing, a maiden gave them food like cheese, that tasted to
each man as he wished it to be, and an Intoxicating liquor that put them asleep
for three days. When they awoke they were at sea in their boat, and of the
island and its inhabitants nothing was to be seen.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Glass Bridge</P>

</B>
<P>
Here we come to one of the most elaborately wrought and
picturesque of all the incidents of the voyage. The island they now reached had
on it a fortress with a brazen door, and a bridge of glass
leading to it. When they sought to cross the bridge it threw them backward.
[like the bridge to Skatha's d&#363;n, p. 188] A woman came out of the fortress
with a pail in her hand, and lifting from the bridge a slab of glass she
let down her pail into the water beneath, and returned to the fortress. They
struck on the brazen portcullis before them to gain admittance, but the melody
given forth by the smitten metal plunged them in slumber till the morrow morn.
Thrice over this happened, the woman each time making an ironical speech about
Maeldun. On the fourth day, however, she came out to them over the bridge,
wearing a white mantle with a circlet of gold on her hair, two silver sandals on
her rosy feet, and a filmy silken smock next her skin.</P>

<P>
&quot;My welcome to thee, O Maeldun,&quot; she said, and she
welcomed each man of the crew by his own name. Then she took them into the great
house and allotted a couch to the chief, and one for each three of his men. She
gave them abundance of food and drink, all out of her one pail, each man finding
in it what he most desired. When she had departed they asked Maeldun if they
should woo the maiden for him. &quot;How would</P>

<P>
[319]</P>

<P>
it hurt you to speak with her?&quot; says Maeldun. They do so,
and she replies: &quot;I know not, nor have ever known, what sin is. Twice over
this is repeated. &quot;To-morrow,&quot; she says at last, &quot;you shall have
your answer.&quot; When the morning breaks, however, they find themselves once
more at sea, with no sign of the island or fortress or lady.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Shouting Birds</P>

</B>
<P>
They hear from afar a great cry and chanting, as it were a
singing of psalms, and rowing for a day and night they come at last to an island
full of birds, black, brown, and speckled, all shouting and speaking. They sail
away without landing.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Anchorite</P>

</B>
<P>
Here they found a wooded island full of birds, and on it a
solitary man, whose only clothing was his hair. They asked him of his country
and kin. He tells them that he was a man of Ireland who had put to sea [probably
we are to understand that he was an anchorite seeking for an islet on which to
dwell in solitude and contemplation. The western islands of Ireland abound in
the ruins of hut, and oratories built by single monks or little communities.]
with a sod of his native country under his feet. God had turned the sod into an
island, adding a foot's breadth to it and one tree for every year. The birds are
his kith and kin, and they all wait there till Doomsday, miraculously nourished
by angels. He entertained them for three nights, and then they sailed away.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Miraculous Fountain</P>

</B>
<P>
This island had a golden rampart, and a soft white soil like
down. In it they found another anchorite clothed only in his hair. There was a
fountain in it</P>

<P>
[320]</P>

<P>
which yields whey or water on Fridays and Wednesdays, milk on
Sundays and feasts of martyrs, and ale and wine on the feasts of Apostles, of
Mary, of John the Baptist, and on the high tides of the year.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Smithy</P>

</B>
<P>
As they approached this they heard from afar as it were the
clanging of a tremendous smithy, and heard men talking of themselves. &quot;
Little boys they seem, said one, &quot;in a little trough yonder.&quot; They
rowed hastily away, but did not turn their boat, so as not to seem to be flying
; but after a while a giant smith came out of the forge holding in his tongs a
huge mass of glowing iron, which he cast after them, and all the sea boiled
round it, as it fell astern of their boat.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Sea of Clear Glass</P>

</B>
<P>
After that they voyaged until they entered a sea that resembled
green glass. Such was its purity that the gravel and the sand of the sea were
clearly visible through it; and they saw no monsters or beasts therein among the
crags, but only the pure gravel and the green sand. For a long space of the day
they were voyaging in that sea, and great was its splendour and its beauty.
[Tennyson has been particularly happy in his description of these undersea
islands]</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;<B>The Undersea Island</P>

</B>
<P>
They next found themselves in a sea, thin like mist, that seemed
as if it would not support their boat. In the depths they saw roofed fortresses,
and a fair land around them. A monstrous beast lodged in a tree there, with
droves of cattle about it, and beneath it an armed warrior. In spite of the
warrior, the beast ever and</P>

<P>
[321]</P>

<P>
anon stretched down a long neck and seized one of the cattle and
devoured it. Much dreading lest they should sink through that mist-like sea,
they sailed over it and away.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Prophecy</P>

</B>
<P>
When they arrived here they found the water rising in high
cliffs round the island, and, looking down, saw on it a crowd of people, who
screamed at them, &quot; It is they, it is they,&quot; till they were out of
breath. Then came a woman and pelted them from below with large nuts, which they
gathered and took with them. As they went they heard the folk crying to each
other:</P>

<P>
&quot;Where are they now?&quot; &quot;They are gone away.
&quot;They are not.&quot; &quot; It is likely,&quot; says the tale, &quot;that
there was some one concerning whom the islanders had a prophecy that he would
ruin their country and expel them from their land.&quot;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Spouting Waters</P>

</B>
<P>
Here a great stream spouted out of one side of the island and
arched over it like a rainbow, falling on the strand at the further side. And
when they thrust their spears into the stream above them they brought out salmon
from it as much as they could and the island was filled with the stench of those
they could not carry away.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Silvern Column</P>

</B>
<P>
The next wonder to which they came forms one of the most
striking and imaginative episodes of the voyage. It was a great silvern column,
four-square, rising from the sea. Each of its four sides was as wide as two
oar-strokes of the boat. Not a sod of earth was at its foot, but it rose from
the boundless</P>

<P>
[322]</P>

<P>
ocean and its summit was lost in the sky. From that summit a
huge silver net was flung far away into the sea, and through a mesh of that net
they sailed. As they did so Diuran hacked away a piece of the net.</P>

<P>
&quot;Destroy it not,&quot; said Maeldun, &quot;for what we see
is the work of mighty men. Diuran said: &quot;For the praise of God's name I do
this, that our tale may be believed, and if I reach Ireland again this piece of
silver shall be offered by me on the high altar of Armagh.&quot; Two ounces and
a half it weighed when it was measured afterwards in Armagh.</P>

<P>
&quot;And then they heard a voice from the summit of yonder
pillar, mighty, clear, and distinct. But they knew not the tongue it spake, or
the words it uttered.&quot;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Pedestal</P>

</B>
<P>
The next island stood on a foot, or pedestal, which rose from
the sea, and they could find no way of access to it. In the base of the pedestal
was a door, closed and locked, which they could not open, so they sailed away,
having seen and spoken with no one.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Women</P>

</B>
<P>
Here they found the rampart of a mighty d&#363;n, enclosing a
mansion. They landed to look on it, and sat on a hillock near by. Within the
d&#363;n they saw seventeen maidens busy at preparing a great bath. In a little
while a rider, richly clad, came up swiftly on a racehorse, and lighted
down and went inside, one of the girls taking the horse. The rider then went
into the bath, when they saw that it was a woman. Shortly after that one of the
maidens came out and invited them to enter, saying: &quot;The Queen invites you.
They went into the fort and bathed, and then sat down to meat, each man with a
maiden over against him, and</P>

<P>
[323]</P>

<P>
Maeldun opposite to the queen. And Maeldun was wedded to the
queen, and each of the maidens to one of his men, and at nightfall canopied
chambers were allotted to each of them. On the morrow morn they made ready to
depart, but the queen would not have them go, and said: &quot;Stay here, and old
age will never fall on you, but ye shall remain as ye are now for ever and ever,
and what ye had last night ye shall have always. And be no longer a-wandering
from island to island on the ocean.&quot;</P>

<P>
She then told Maeldun that she was the mother of the seventeen
girls they had seen, and her husband had been king of the island.
He was now dead, and she reigned in his place. Each day she went into the great
plain in the interior of the island to judge the folk, and returned to the
d&#363;n at night.</P>

<P>
So they remained there for three months of winter; but at the
end of that time it seemed they had been there three years, and the men wearied
of it, and longed to set forth for their own country.</P>

<P>
&quot;What shall we find there,&quot; said Maeldun, &quot;that
is better than this?&quot;</P>

<P>
But still the people murmured and complained, and at last they
said: &quot;Great is the love which Maeldun has for his woman. Let him stay with
her alone if he will, but we will go to our own country.&quot; But Maeldnn would
not be left after them, and at last one day, when the queen was away judging the
folk, they went on board their bark and put out to sea. Before they had gone
far, however, the queen came riding up with a clew of twine in her hand, and she
flung it after them. Maeldun caught it in his hand, and it clung to his hand so
that he could not free himself and the queen, holding the other end, drew them
back to land. And they stayed on the island another three months.</P>

<P>
[324]</P>

<P>
Twice again the same thing happened, and at<I> </I>last the
people averred that Maeldun held the clew on purpose, so great was his love for
the woman. So the next time another man caught the clew, but it clung to his
hand as before; so Diuran smote off his hand, and it fell with the clew into the
sea. &quot;When she saw that she at once began to wail and shriek, so that all
the land was one cry, wailing and shrieking.&quot; And thus they escaped from
the Island of the Women.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Red Berries</P>

</B>
<P>
On this island were trees with great red berries which yielded
an intoxicating and slumbrous juice. They mingled it with water to moderate its
power, and filled their casks with it, and sailed away.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Eagle</P>

</B>
<P>
A large island, with woods of oak and yew on one side of it, and
on the other a plain, whereon were herds of sheep, and a little lake in it ; and
there also they found a small church and a fort, and an ancient grey cleric,
clad only in his hair. Maeldun asked him who he was.</P>

<P>
&quot;I am the fifteenth man of the monks of St. Brennan of
Birr,&quot; he said. &quot;We went on our pilgrimage into the ocean, and they
have all died save me alone.' He showed them the tablet (?calendar) of the Holy
Brennan, and they prostrated themselves before it, and Maeldun kissed it. They
stayed there for a season, feeding on the sheep of the island.</P>

<P>
One day they saw what seemed to be a cloud coming up from the
south-west. As it drew near, however, they saw the waving of pinions, and
perceived that it was an enormous bird. It came into the island, and, alighting
very wearily on a hill near the lake, it began</P>

<P>
[325]</P>

<P>
eating the red berries, like grapes, which grew on a huge
tree-branch as big as a full-grown oak, that it had brought with it, and the
juice and fragments of the berries fell into the lake, reddening all the water.
Fearful that it would seize them in its talons and bear them out to sea, they
lay hid in the woods and watched it. After a while, however, Maeldun went out to
the foot<I> </I>of the hill, but the bird did him no harm, and then the rest
followed cautiously behind their shields, and one of them gathered the berries
off the branch which the bird held in its talons, but it did them no evil, and
regarded them not at all. And they saw that it was very old, and its plumage
dull and decayed.</P>

<P>
At the hour of noon two eagles came up from the south-west and
alit in front of the great bird, and after resting awhile they set to work
picking off the insects that infested its jaws and eyes and ears. This they
continued till vespers, when all three ate of the berries again. At last, on the
following day, when the great bird had been completely cleansed, it plunged into
the lake, and again the two eagles picked and cleansed it. Till the third day
the great bird remained preening and shaking its pinions, and its feathers
became glossy and abundant, and then, soaring upwards, it flew thrice round the
island, and away to the quarter whence it had come, and its flight was now swift
and strong; whence it was manifest to them that this had been its renewal from
old age to youth, according as the prophet said, <I>Thy youth is renewed like
the eagle's</I>. [Ps. Ciii, 5]</P>

<P>
Then Diuran said : &quot;Let us bathe in that lake and renew
ourselves where the bird hath been renewed.&quot; &quot;Nay,&quot; said another,
&quot;for the bird hath left his venom in it.&quot; But Diuran plunged in and
drank of the water. From that time so long as he lived his eyes were strong</P>

<P>
[326]</P>

<P>
and keen, and not a tooth fell from his jaw nor a hair from his
head, and he never knew illness or infirmity.</P>

<P>
Thereafter they bade farewell to the anchorite, and fared forth
on the ocean once more.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Laughing Folk</P>

</B>
<P>
Here they found a great company of men laughing and playing
incessantly. They drew lots as to who should enter and explore it, and it fell
to Maeldun's foster-brother. But when he set foot on it he at once began to
laugh and play with the others, and could not leave off; nor would he come back
to his comrades. So they left him and sailed away. [this disposes of the last of
the foster-brothers, who should not have joined the party.]</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Flaming Rampart</P>

</B>
<P>
They now came in sight of an island which was not large, and it
had about it a rampart of flame that circled round and round it continually. In
one part of the rampart there was an opening, and when this opening came
opposite to them they saw through it the whole island, and saw those who dwelt
therein, even men and women, beautiful, many, and wearing adorned garments, with
vessels of gold in their hands. And the festal music which they made came to the
ears of the wanderers. For a long time they lingered there, watching this
marvel, &quot;and they deemed it delightful to behold.&quot;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Monk of Tory</P>

</B>
<P>
Far off among the waves they saw what they took to be a white
bird on the water. Drawing near to it they found it to be an aged man clad only
in the white hair</P>

<P>
[327]</P>

<P>
of his body, and he was throwing himself in prostrations on a
broad rock.</P>

<P>
&quot;From Torach [Tory Island, off the Donegal coast. There was
there a monastery and a church dedicated to St. Columba] have come hither,&quot;
he said, &quot;and there I was reared. I was cook in the monastery there, and
the food of the Church I used to sell for myself, so that I had at last much
treasure of raiment and brazen vessels and gold-bound books and all that man
desires. Great was my pride and arrogance.</P>

<P>
&quot;One day as I dug a grave in which to bury a churl who had
been brought on to the island, a voice came from below where a holy man lay
buried, and he said: 'Put not the corpse of a sinner on me, a holy, pious person
!' &quot;</P>

<P>
After a dispute the monk buried the corpse elsewhere, and was
promised an eternal reward for doing so. Not long thereafter he put to sea in a
boat with all his accumulated treasures, meaning apparently to escape from the
island with his plunder. A great wind blew him far out to sea, and when he was
out of sight of land the boat stood still in one place. He saw near him a man
(angel) sitting on the wave. &quot;Whither goest thou?&quot; said the man.
&quot;On a pleasant way, whither I am now looking,&quot; said the monk. &quot;It
would not be pleasant to thee if thou knewest what is around thee,&quot; said
the man. &quot; So far as eye can see there is one crowd of demons all gathered
around thee, because of thy covetousness and pride, and theft, and other evil
deeds. Thy boat hath stopped, nor will it move until thou do my will, and the
fires of hell shall get hold of thee.&quot;</P>

<P>
He came near to the boat, and laid his hand on the arm of the
fugitive, who promised to do his will.</P>

<P>
&quot;Fling into the sea,&quot; he said, &quot;all the wealth
that is in thy boat.&quot;</P>

<P>
[328]</P>

<P>
&quot; It is a pity,&quot; said the monk, &quot; that it should
go to loss.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;It shall in nowise go to loss. There will be one man whom
thou wilt profit.&quot;</P>

<P>
The monk thereupon flung everything into the sea save one little
wooden cup, and he cast away oars and rudder. The man gave him a provision of
whey and seven cakes, and bade him abide wherever his boat should stop. The wind
and waves carried him hither and thither till at last the boat came to rest upon
the rock where the wanderers found him. There was nothing there but the bare
rock, but remembering what he was bidden he stepped out upon a little ledge over
which the waves washed, and the boat immediately left him, and the rock was
enlarged for him. There he remained seven years, nourished by otters which
brought him salmon out of the sea, and even flaming firewood on which to cook
them, and his cup was filled with good liquor every day. &quot;And neither wet
nor heat nor cold affects me in this place.&quot;</P>

<P>
At the noon hour miraculous nourishment was brought for the
whole crew, and thereafter the ancient man said to them :</P>

<P>
&quot;Ye will all reach your country, and the man that slew thy
father, O Maeldun, ye will find him in a fortress before you. And slay him not,
but forgive him because God hath saved you from manifold great perils, and ye
too are men deserving of death.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then they bade him farewell and went on their accustomed way.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Island of the Falcon</P>

</B>
<P>
This is uninhabited save for herds of sheep and oxen. They land
on it and eat their fill, and one of them sees there a large falcon. &quot;This
falcon,&quot; he says, &quot; is</P>

<P>
[329]</P>

<P>
like the falcons of Ireland.&quot; &quot;Watch it,&quot; says
Maddun, &quot;and see how it will go from us.&quot; It flew off to the
south-east, and they rowed after it all day till vespers.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Home-corning</P>

</B>
<P>
At nightfall they sighted a land like Ireland ; and soon came to
a small island, where they ran their prow ashore. It was the island where dwelt
the man who had slain Ailill.</P>


<P>
They went up to the d&#363;n that was on the island, and heard
men talking within it as they sat at meat. One man said :</P>


<P>
&quot;It would be ill for us if we saw Maeldun now.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;That Maeldun has been drowned,&quot; said another.</P>

<P>
&quot;Maybe it is he who shall waken you from sleep
to-night,&quot; said a third.</P>

<P>
&quot;If he should come now,&quot; said a fourth, &quot;what
should we do?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Not hard to answer that,&quot; said the chief of them.</P>

<P>
&quot;Great welcome should he have if he were to come, for he
hath been a long space in great tribulation.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then Maeldun smote with the wooden clapper against the door.
&quot;Who is there?&quot; asked the door-keeper.</P>

<P>
&quot; Maeldun is here,&quot; said he.</P>

<P>
They entered the house in peace, and great welcome was made for
them, and they were arrayed in new garments. And then they told the story of all
the marvels that God had shown them, according to the words of the &quot;sacred
poet,&quot; who said, <I>Haec olim meminisse juvabit</I>. [&quot;One day we
shall delight in the remembrance of these things.&quot; The quotation is from
Vergil, &quot; Aen.&quot; i 203 &quot;Sacred poet&quot; is a translation of the <I>vates
sacer</I>, of Horace.]</P>

<P>
[330]</P>

<P>
Then Maeldun went to his own home and kindred, and Diuran the
Rhymer took with him the piece of silver that he had hewn from the net of the
pillar, and laid it on the high altar of Armagh in triumph and exultation at the
miracles that God had wrought for them. And they told again the story of all
that had befallen them, and all the marvels they had seen by sea and land) and
the perils they had endured.</P>

<P>
The story ends with the following words :</P>

<P>
&quot;Now Aed the Fair [Aed Finn [This sage and poet has nor
been identified from any other record. Praise and thanks to him, whoever he may
have been.]], chief sage of Ireland, arranged this story as it standeth here ;
and he did so for a delight to the mind, and for the folks of Ireland after
him.&quot;</P>
