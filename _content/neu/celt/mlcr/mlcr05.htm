  <P>
The Curse of Macha</P>

</B>
<P>
THE centre of interest in Irish legend now
shifts from Tara to Ulster, and a multitude of heroic tales gather round the
Ulster king Conor mac Nessa, round Cuchulain, [pronounced
&quot;Koohoo&#180;lin.&quot;] his great vassal, and the Red Branch Order of
chivalry, which had its seat in Emain Macha.</P>

<P>
The legend of the foundation of Emain Macha
has already been told [page 150]. But Macha, who was no mere woman, but a
supernatural being, appears again in connexion with the history of Ulster in a
very curious tale which was supposed to account for the strange debility or
helplessness that at critical moments sometimes fell, it was believed, upon the
warriors of the province.</P>

<P>
The legend tells that a wealthy Ulster farmer
named Crundchu, son of Agnoman, dwelling in a solitary place among the hills,
found one day in his d&#363;n a young woman of great beauty and in splendid
array, whom he had never seen before. Crundchu, we are told, was a widower, his
wife having died after bearing him four sons. The strange woman, without a word,
set herself to do the houshold tasks, prepared dinner, milked the cow, and took
on herself all the duties of the mistress of the household. At night she lay
down at Crundchu's side, and thereafter dwelt with him as his wife; and they
loved each other dearly. Her name was Macha.</P>

<P>
One day Crundchu prepared himself to go to a
great fair or assembly of the Ultonians, where there would be feasting and
horse-racing, tournaments and music, and merrymaking of all kinds. Macha begged
her husband</P>

<P>
[178]</P>

<P>
not to go. He persisted. &quot; Then,&quot;
she said, &quot; at least do not speak of me in the assembly, for I may dwell
with you only so long as I am not spoken of.&quot;</P>

<P>
It has been observed that we have here the
earliest appearance in postclassical European literature of the well-known
motive of the fairy bride who can stay with her mortal lover only so long as
certain conditions are observed, such as that he shall not spy upon her,
ill-treat her, or ask of her origin.</P>

<P>
Crundchu promised to obey the injunction, and
went to the festival. Here the two horses of the king carried off prize after
prize in the racing, and the people cried &quot;There is not in Ireland a
swifter than the King's pair of horses.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;I have a wife at home,&quot; said
Crundchu, in a moment of forgetfulness, &quot;who can run quicker than these
horses.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Seize that man,&quot; said the angry
king, &quot;and hold him till his wife be brought to the contest.&quot;</P>

<P>
So messengers went for Macha, and she was
brought before the assembly; and she was with child. The king bade her prepare
for the race. She pleaded her condition. &quot;I am close upon my hour,&quot;
she said. &quot;Then hew her man in pieces,&quot; said the king to his guards.
Macha turned to the bystanders. &quot;Help me,&quot; she cried, &quot; for a
mother hath borne each of you ! Give me but a short delay till I am
delivered.&quot; But the king and all the crowd in their savage lust for sport
would hear of no delay. &quot;Then bring up the horses,&quot; said Macha,
&quot;and because you have no pity a heavier infamy shall fall upon you.&quot;
So she raced against the horses, and outran them, but as she came to the goal
she gave a great cry, and her travail seized her, and she gave birth to twin
children. As she uttered that cry, however, all the spectators felt</P>

<P>
[179]</P>

<P>
themselves seized with pangs like her own and
had no more strength than a woman in her travail. And Macha prophesied
&quot;From this hour the shame you have wrought on me will fall upon each man of
Ulster. In the hours of your greatest need ye shall be weak and helpless as
women in childbirth, and this shall endure for five days and four nights - to
the ninth generation the curse shall be upon you.&quot; And so it came to pass;
and this is the cause of the Debility of the Ultonians that was wont to afflict
the warriors of the province.</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

Conor mac Nessa</P>

</B>
<P>
The chief occasion on which this Debility was
manifested was when Maev, Queen of Connacht, made the famous Cattle-raid of
Quelgny <I>(Tam Bo Cuailgn&#233;</I>)<I>, </I>which forms the subject of the
greatest tale in Irish literature. We have now to relate the preliminary history
leading up to this epic tale and introducing its chief characters.</P>

<P>
Fachtna the Giant, King of Ulster, had to
wife Nessa, daughter of Echid Yellow-heel, and she bore him a son named Conor.
But when Fachtna died Fergus son of Roy, his half-brother, succeeded him, Conor
being then but a youth. Now Fergus loved Nessa, and would have wedded her, but
she made conditions. &quot;Let my son Conor reign one year,&quot; she said,
&quot;so that his posterity may be the descendants of a king, and I
consent.&quot; Fergus agreed, and young Conor took the throne. But so wise and
prosperous was his rule and so sagacious his judgments that, at the year's end,
the people, as Nessa foresaw, would have him remain king; and Fergus, who loved
the feast and the chase better than the toils of kingship, was content to have
it so, and remained at Conor's court for a time, great, honoured, and happy, but
king no longer.</P>

<P>
[180]</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Red Branch</P>

</B>
<P>
In his time was the glory of the &quot;Red
Branch&quot; in Ulster, who were the offspring of Ross the Red, King of Ulster,
with collateral relatives and allies, forming ultimately a kind of warlike
Order. Most of the Red Branch heroes appear in the Ultonian Cycle of legend, so
that a statement of their names and relationships may be usefully placed here
before we proceed to speak of their doings. It is noticeable that they have a
partly supernatural ancestry. Ross the Red, it is said, wedded a Danaan woman,
Maga, daughter of Angus Og [see page 121 - 123 for an account of this deity]. As
a second wife he wedded a maiden named Roy. His descendants are as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
But Maga was also wedded to the Druid
Cathbad, and by<I> </I>him had three daughters, whose descendants played a
notable part in the Ultonian legendary cycle.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
[Dectera also had a mortal husband, Sualtam,
who passed as Cuchulain's father.]</P>

<P>
[181]</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

Birth of Cuchulain</P>

</B>
<P>
It was during the reign of Conor mac Nessa
that the birth of the mightiest hero of the Celtic race, Cuchulain, came about,
and this was the manner of it. The maiden Dectera, daughter of Cathbad, with
fifty young girls, her companions at the court of Conor, one day disappeared,
and for three years no searching availed to discover their dwelling-place or
their fate. At last one summer day a flock of birds descended on the fields
about Emain Macha and began to destroy the crops and fruit. The king, with
Fergus and others of his nobles, went out against them with slings, but the
birds flew only a little way off<I>, </I>luring the party on and on till at last
they found themselves near the Fairy Mound of Angus on the river Boyne. Night
fell, and the king sent Fergus with a party to discover some habitation where
they might sleep. A hut was found, where they betook themselves to rest, but one
of them, exploring further, came to a noble mansion by the river, and on
entering it was met by a young man of splendid appearance. With the stranger was
a lovely woman, his wife, and fifty maidens, who saluted the Ulster warrior with
joy. And he recognised in them Dectera and her maidens, whom they had missed for
three years, and in the glorious youth Lugh of the Long Arm, son of Ethlinn. He
went back with his tale to the king, who immediately sent for Dectera to come to
him. She, alleging that she was ill, requested a delay; and so the night passed
; but in the morning there was found in the hut among the Ulster warriors a
new-born male infant. It was Dectera's gift to Ulster, and for this purpose she
had lured them to the fairy palace by the Boyne. The child was taken home by the
warriors and was given to Dectera's sister, Finchoom, who was then</P>

<P>
[182]</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
nursing her own child, Conall, and the boy's
name was called Setanta. And the part of Ulster from Dundalk southward to Usna
in Meath, which is called the Plain of Murthemney, was allotted for his
inheritance, and in later days his fortress and dwelling-place was in Dundalk.</P>

<P>
It is said that the Druid Morann prophesied
over the infant : &quot;His praise will be in the mouths of all men charioteers
and warriors, kings and sages will recount his deeds; he will win the love of
many. This child will avenge all your wrongs; he will give combat at your fords,
he will decide all your quarrels.&quot;</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

The Hound of CuIlan</P>

</B>
<P>
When he was old enough the boy Setanta went
to the court of Conor to be brought up and instructed along with the other sons
of princes and chieftains. It was now that the event occurred from which he got
the name of Cuchulain, by which he was hereafter to be known.</P>

<P>
One afternoon King Conor and his nobles were
going to a feast to which they were bidden at the dun of a wealthy smith named
Cullan, in Quelgny, where they also meant to spend the night. Setanta was to
accompany them, but as the cavalcade set off he was in the midst of a game of
hurley with his companions and bade the king go forward, saying he would follow
later when his play was done. The royal company arrived at their destination as
night began to fall. Cullan received them hospitably, and in the great hall they
made merry over meat and wine while the lord of the house barred the gates of
his fortress and let loose outside a huge and ferocious dog which every night
guarded the lonely mansion, and under whose protection, it was said, Cullan
feared nothing less than the onset of an army.</P>

<P>
[183]</P>

<P>
But they had forgotten Setanta ! In the
middle of the laughter and music of the feast a terrible sound was heard which
brought every man to his feet in an instant. It was the tremendous baying of the
hound of Cullan, giving tongue as it saw a stranger approach. Soon the noise
changed to the howls of a fierce combat, but, on rushing to the gates, they saw
in the glare of the lanterns a young boy and the hound lying dead at his feet.
When it flew at him he had seized it by the throat and dashed its life out
against the side-posts of the gate. The warriors bore in the lad with rejoicing
and wonder, but soon the triumph ceased, for there stood their host, silent and
sorrowful over the body of his faithful friend, who had died for the safety of
his house and would never guard it more.</P>

<P>
&quot;Give me,&quot; then said the lad
Setanta, &quot;a whelp of that hound, O Cullan, and I will train him to be all
to you that his sire was. And until then give me shield and spear and I will
myself guard your house; never hound guarded it better than I will.&quot;</P>

<P>
And all the company shouted applause at the
generous pledge, and on the spot, as a commemoration of his first deed of
valour, they named the lad Cuchulain. [It is noticeable that among the
characters figuring in the Ultonian legendary cycle many names occur of which
the word <I>Cn </I>(hound) forms a part. Thus we have Curoi, Cucorb, Be&#228;lcu,
&amp;c. The reference is no doubt to the Irish wolf-hound, a fine type of valour
and beauty.] the Hound of Cullan, and by that name he was known until he died.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Cuchulain Assumes Arms</P>

</B>
<P>
When he was older, and near the time when he
might assume the weapons of manhood, it chanced one day that he passed close by
where Cathbad the Druid</P>

<P>
[184]</P>

<P>
was teaching to certain of his pupils the art
of divination and augury. One of them asked of Cathbad for what kind of
enterprise that same day might be favourable ; and Cathbad, having worked a
spell of divination, said : &quot;The youth who should take up arms on this day
would become of all men in Erin most famous for great deeds, yet will his life
be short and fleeting.&quot; Cuchulain passed on as though he marked it not, and
he came before the king. &quot;What wilt thou ?&quot; asked Conor. &quot;To take
the arms of manhood,&quot; said Cuchulain. &quot;So he it,&quot; said the king,
and he gave the lad two great spears. But Cuchulain shook them in his hand, and
the staves splintered and broke. And so he did with many others ; and the
chariots in which they set him to drive he broke to pieces with stamping of his
foot, until at last the king's own chariot of war and his two spears and sword
were brought to the lad, and these he could not break, do what he would ; so
this equipment he retained.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
His Courtship of Emer</P>

</B>
<P>
The young Cuchulain was by this grown so fair
and noble a youth that every maid or matron on whom he looked was bewitched by
him, and the men of Ulster bade him take a wife of his own. But none were
pleasing to him, till at last he saw the lovely maiden Emer, daughter of
Forgall, the lord of Lusca, [Now Lusk, a village on the coast a few miles north
of Dublin.] and he resolved to woo her for his bride. So he bade harness his
chariot, and with Laeg, his friend and charioteer, he journeyed to D&#363;n
Forgall.</P>

<P>
As he drew near, the maiden was with her
companions, daughters of the vassals of Forgall, and she was teaching them
embroidery, for in that art she excelled all women. She had &quot;the six gifts
of</P>

<P>
[185]</P>

<P>
womanhood - the gift of beauty, the gift of
voice, the gift of sweet speech, the gift of needlework) the gift of wisdom, and
the gift of chastity.&quot;</P>

<P>
Hearing the thunder of horse-hoofs and the
clangour of the chariot from afar, she bade one of the maidens go to the rampart
of the Dun and tell her what she saw. &quot;A chariot is coming on,&quot; said
the maiden, &quot;drawn by two steeds with tossing heads, fierce and powerful;
one is grey, the other black. They breathe fire from their jaws, and the clods
of turf they throw up behind them as they race are like a flock of birds that
follow in their track. In the chariot is a dark, sad man, comeliest of the men
of Erin. He is clad in a crimson cloak, with a brooch of gold, and on his back
is a crimson shield with a silver rim wrought with figures of beasts. With him
as his charioteer is a tall, slender, freckled man with curling red hair held by
a fillet of bronze, with plates of gold at either side of his face. With a goad
of red gold he urges the horses.&quot;</P>

<P>
When the chariot drew up Emer went to meet
Cuchulain and saluted him. But when he urged his love upon her she told him of
the might and the wiliness of her father Forgall, and of the strength of the
champions that guarded her lest she should wed against his will. And when he
pressed her more she said &quot;I may not marry before my sister Fial, who is
older than I. She is with me here - she is excellent in handiwork.&quot;
&quot;It is not Fial whom I love,&quot; said Cuchulain. Then as they were
conversing he saw the breast of the maiden over the bosom of her smock, and said
to her &quot;Fair is this plain, the plain of the noble yoke.&quot; &quot;None
comes to this plain,&quot; said she, &quot;who has not slain his hundreds, and
thy deeds are still to do.&quot;</P>

<P>
So Cuchulain then left her, and drove back to
Emain Macha.</P>

<P>
[186]</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

Cuchulain in the Land of Skatha</P>

</B>
<P>
Next day Cuchulain bethought himself how he
could prepare himself for war and for the deeds of heroism which Emer had
demanded of him. Now he had heard of a mighty woman-warrior named Skatha, who
dwelt in the Land of Shadows, [owing to the similarity of the name the
supernatural country of Skath:, &quot;the Shadowy,&quot; was early identified
with the islands of Skye, where the Cuchulain Peaks still bear witness to the
legend.] and who could teach to young heroes who came to her wonderful feats of
arms. So Cuchulain went overseas to find her, and many dangers he had to meet,
black forests and desert plains to traverse, before he could get tidings of
Skatha and her land. At last he came to the Plain of Ill-luck, where he could
not cross without being mired in its bottomless bogs or sticky clay, and while
he was debating what he should do he saw coming towards him a young man with a
face that shone like the sun, [this of course, was Cuchulain's father, Lugh] and
whose very look put cheerfulness and hope into his heart. The young man gave him
a wheel and told him to roll it before him on the plain, and to follow it
whithersoever it went. So Cuchulain set the wheel rolling, and as it went it
blazed with light that shot like rays from its rim, and the heat of it made a
firm path across the quagmire, where Cuchulain followed safely.</P>

<P>
When he had passed the Plain of Ill-luck, and
escaped the beasts of the Perilous Glen, he came to the Bridge of the Leaps,
beyond which was the country of Skatha. Here he found on the hither side many
sons of the princes of Ireland who were come to learn feats of war from Skatha,
and they were playing at hurley on the green. And among them was his friend
Ferdia, son of the Firbolg, Daman; and they all asked him of</P>

<P>
[187]</P>

<P>
the news from Ireland. When he had told them
all he asked Ferdia how he should pass to the dun of Skatha. Now the Bridge of
Leaps was very narrow and very high, and it crossed a gorge where far below
swung the tides of a boiling sea, in which ravenous monsters could be seen
swimming.</P>

<P>
&quot;Not one of us has crossed that
bridge,&quot; said Ferdia, &quot;for there are two feats that Skatha teaches
last, and one is the leap across the bridge, and the other the thrust of the Gae
Bolg. [this means probably &quot;the belly spear.&quot; With this terrible
weapon Cuchulain was fated in the end to slay his friend Ferdia.] For if a man
step upon one end of that bridge, the middle straightway rises up and flings him
back, and if he leap upon it he may chance to miss his footing and fall into the
gulf, where the sea-monsters are waiting for him.&quot;</P>

<P>
But Cuchulain waited till evening, when he
had recovered his strength from his long journey, and then essayed the crossing
of the bridge. Three times he ran towards it from a distance, gathering all his
powers together, and strove to leap upon the middle, but three times it rose
against him and flung him back, while his companions jeered at him because he
would not wait for the help of Skatha. But at the fourth leap he lit fairly on
the centre of the bridge, and with one leap more he was across it, and stood
before the strong fortress of Skatha; and she wondered at his courage and
vigour, and admitted him to be her pupil.</P>

<P>
For a year and a day Cuchulain abode with
Skatha, and all the feats she had to teach he learned easily, and last of all
she taught him the use of the Gae Bolg, and gave him that dreadful weapon, which
she had deemed no champion before him good enough to have. And the manner of
using the Gae Boig was that it was thrown with the foot, and if it entered an
enemy's</P>

<P>
[188]</P>

<P>
body it filled every limb and crevice of him
with its barbs. While Cuchulain dwelt with Skatha his friend above all friends
and his rival in skill and valour was Ferdia, and ere they parted they vowed to
love and help one another as long as they should live.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Cuchulain and Aifa</P>

</B>
<P>
Now whilst Cuchulain was in the Land of the
Shadows it chanced that Skatha made war on the people of the Princess Aifa, who
was the fiercest and strongest of the woman-warriors of the world, so that even
Skatha feared to meet her in arms. On going forth to the war, therefore, Skatha
mixed with Cuchulain's drink a sleepy herb so that he should not wake for
four-and-twenty hours, by which time the host would be far on its way, for she
feared lest evil should come to him ere he had got his full strength. But the
potion that would have served another man for a day and a night only held
Cuchulain for one hour; and when he waked up he seized his arms and followed the
host by its chariot-tracks till he came up with them. Then it is said that
Skatha uttered a sigh, for she knew that he would not be restrained from the
war.</P>

<P>
When the armies met, Cuchulain and the two
sons of Skatha wrought great deeds on the foe, and slew six of the mightiest of
Aifa's warriors. Then Aifa sent word to Skatha and challenged her to single
combat. But Cuchulain declared that he would meet the fair Fury in place of
Skatha, and he asked first of all what were the things she most valued.
&quot;What Aifa loves most,&quot; said Skatha, &quot;are her two horses, her
chariot and her charioteer.&quot; Then the pair met in single combat, and every
champion's feat which they knew they tried on each other in vain, till at last a
blow of Aifa's shattered the sword of Cuchulain to the hilt.</P>

<P>
[189]</P>

<P>
At this Cuchulain cried out: &quot;Ah me !
behold the chariot and horses of Aifa fallen into the glen !&quot; Aifa glanced
round, and Cuchulain, rushing in, seized her round the waist and slung her over
his shoulder and bore her back to the camp of Skatha. There he flung her on the
ground and put his knife to her throat. She begged for her life, and Cuchulain
granted it on condition that she made a lasting peace with Skatha, and gave
hostages for her fulfilment of the pledge. To this she agreed, and Cuchulain and
she became not only friends but lovers.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Tragedy of Cuchulain and Connla</P>

</B>
<P>
Before Cuchulain left the Land of Shadows he
gave Aifa a golden ring, saying that if she should bear him a son he was to be
sent to seek his father in Erin so soon as he should have grown so that his
finger would fit the ring. And Cuchulain said, &quot;Charge him under <I>geise</I>
that he shall not make himself known, that he never turn out of the way for any
man, nor ever refuse a combat. And be his name called Connla.&quot;</P>

<P>
In later years it is narrated that one day
when King Conor of Ulster and the lords of Ulster were at a festal gathering on
the Strand of the Footprints they saw coming towards them across the sea a
little boat of bronze, and in it a young lad with gilded oars in his hands. In
the boat was a heap of stones, and ever and anon the lad would put one of these
stones into a sling and cast it at a flying sea-bird in such fashion that it
would bring down the bird alive to his feet. And many other wonderful feats of
skill he did. Then Conor said, as the boat drew nearer: &quot;If the grown men
of that lad's country came here they would surely grind us to powder. Woe to the
land into which that boy shall come !&quot;</P>

<P>
[190]</P>

<P>
When the boy came to land, a messenger,
Condery, was sent to bid him be off. &quot;I will not turn back for thee,&quot;
said the lad, and Condery repeated what he had said to the king. Then Conall of
the Victories was sent against him, but the lad slung a great stone at him, and
the whizz and wind of it knocked him down, and the lad sprang upon him, and
bound his arms with the strap of his shield. And so man after man was served;
some were bound, and some were slain, but the lad defied the whole power of
Ulster to turn him back, nor would he tell his name or lineage.</P>

<P>
&quot;Send for Cuchulain,&quot; then said
King Conor. And they sent a messenger to Dundalk, where Cuchulain was with Emer
his wife, and bade him come to do battle against a stranger boy whom Conall of
the Victories could not overcome. Emer threw her arm round Cuchulain's neck.
&quot;Do not go,&quot; she entreated. &quot;Surely this is the son of Aifa. Slay
not thine only son.&quot; But Cuchulain said: &quot;Forbear, woman ! Were it
Connla himself I would slay him for the honour of Ulster,&quot; and he bade yoke
his chariot and went to the Strand. Here he found the boy tossing up his weapons
and doing marvellous feats with them. &quot;Delightful is thy play, boy,&quot;
said Cuchulain; &quot;who art thou and whence dost thou come ?&quot; &quot;I may
not reveal that,&quot; said the lad. &quot;Then thou shalt die,&quot; said
Cuchulain. &quot;So be it,&quot; said the lad, and then they fought with swords
for a while, till the lad delicately shore off a lock of Cuchulain's hair.
&quot;Enough of trifling,&quot; said Cuchulain, and they closed with each other,
but the lad planted himself on 'a rock and stood so firm that Cuchulain could
not move him, and in the stubborn wrestling they had the lad's two feet sank
deep into the stone and made the footprints whence the Strand of the Footprints
has its name. At last they both fell</P>

<P>
[191]</P>

<P>
into the sea, and Cuchulain was near being
drowned, till he bethought himself of the Gae Bolg, and he drove that weapon
against the lad and it ripped up his belly. &quot;That is what Skatha never
taught me,&quot; cried the lad. &quot;Woe is me, for I am hurt.&quot; Cuchulain
looked at him and saw the ring on his finger. &quot; It is true,&quot; he said;
and he took up the boy and bore him on shore and laid him down before Conor and
the lords of Ulster. &quot;Here is my son for you, men of Ulster,&quot; he said.
And the boy said: &quot;it is true. And if I had five years to grow among you,
you would conquer the world on every side of you and rule as far as Rome. But
since it is as it is, point out to me the famous warriors that are here, that I
may know them and take leave of them before I die.&quot; Then one after another
they were brought to him, and he kissed them and took leave of his father, and
he died; and the men of Ulster made his grave and set up his pillar-stone with
great mourning. This was the only son Cuchulain ever had, and this son he slew.</P>

<P>
This tale, as I have given it here, dates
from the ninth century, and is found in the &quot;Yellow Book of Lecan.&quot;
There are many other Gaelic versions of it in poetry and prose. It is one of the
earliest extant appearances in literature of the since well-known theme of the
slaying of a heroic son by his father. The Persian rendering of it in the tale
of Sohrab and Rustum has been made familiar by Matthew Arnold's fine poem. In
the Irish version it will be noted that the father is not without a suspicion of
the identity of his antagonist, but he does battle with him under the stimulus
of that passionate sense of loyalty to his prince and province which was
Cuchulain's most signal characteristic.</P>

<P>
To complete the story of Aifa and her son we
have anticipated events, and now turn back to take up the thread again.</P>

<P>
Cuchulain's First Foray</P>

</B>
<P>
After a year and a day of training in warfare
under Skatha, Cuchulain returned to Erin, eager to test his prowess and to win
Emer for his wife. So he bade harness his chariot and drove out to make a foray
upon the fords and marches of Connacht, for between Connacht and Ulster there
was always an angry surf of fighting along the borders.</P>

<P>
And first he drove to the White Cairn, which
is on the highest of the Mountains of Mourne, and surveyed the land of Ulster
spread out smiling in the sunshine far below and bade his charioteer tell him
the name of every hill and plain and d&#363;n that he saw. Then turning
southwards he looked over the plains of Bregia, and the charioteer pointed out
to him Tara and Teltin, and Brugh na Boyna and the great d&#363;n of the sons of
Nechtan. &quot;Are they,&quot; asked Cuchulain, &quot;those sons of Nechtan of
whom it is said that more of the men of Ulster have fallen by their hands than
are yet living on the earth ?&quot; &quot;The same,&quot; said the charioteer.
Then let us drive thither,&quot; said Cuchulain. So, much unwilling, the
charioteer drove to the fortress of the sons of Nechtan, and there on the green
before it they found a pillar-stone, and round it a collar of bronze having on
it writing in Ogham. This Cuchulain read, and it declared that any man of age to
bear arms who should come to that green should hold it <I>geis </I>for him to
depart without having challenged one of the dwellers in the d&#363;n to single
combat. Then Cuchulain flung his arms round the stone, and, swaying it backwards
and forwards, heaved it at last out of the earth and flung it, collar and all,
into the river that ran hard by. &quot;Surely,&quot; said the charioteer, &quot;
thou art seeking for a violent death, and now thou wilt find it without
delay.&quot;</P>

<P>
[193]</P>


<P>
Then Foill son of Nechtan came forth from the d&#363;n, and
seeing Cuchulain, whom he deemed but a lad, he was annoyed. But Cuchulain bade
him fetch his arms, &quot;for I slay not drivers nor messengers nor unarmed
men,&quot; and Foill went back into the d&#363;n.</P>


<P>
&quot;Thou canst not slay him,&quot; then
said the charioteer, &quot;for he is invulnerable by magic power to the point or
edge of any blade.&quot; But Cuchulain put in his sling a ball of tempered iron,
and when Foill appeared he slung at him so that it struck his forehead, and went
clean through brain and skull; and Cuchulain took his head and bound it to his
chariot-rim. And other sons of Nechtan, issuing forth, he fought with and slew
by sword or spear; and then he fired the d&#363;n and left it in a blaze and
drove on exultant. And on the way he saw a flock of wild swans, and sixteen of
them he brought down alive with his sling, and tied them to the chariot; and
seeing a herd of wild deer which his horses could not overtake he lighted down
and chased them on foot till he caught two great stags, and with thongs and
ropes he made them fast to the chariot.</P>

<P>
But at Emain Macha a scout of King Conor came
running in to give him news. &quot;Behold, a solitary chariot is approaching
swiftly over the plain; wild white birds flutter round it and wild stags are
tethered to it; it is decked all round with the bleeding heads ot enemies.&quot;
And Conor looked to see who was approaching, and he saw that Cuchulain was in
his battle-fury, and would deal death around him whomsoever he met; so he
hastily gave order that a troop of the women of Emania should go forth to meet
him, and, having stripped off their clothing, should stand naked in the way.
This they did, and when the lad saw them, smitten with shame, he bowed his head
upon the chariot-rim. Then Conor's men instantly seized him</P>

<P>
[194]</P>

<P>
and plunged him into a vat of cold water
which had been made ready, but the water boiled around him and the staves and
hoops of the vat were burst asunder. This they did again and yet again, and at
last his fury left him, and his natural form and aspect were restored. Then they
clad him in fresh raiment and bade him in to the feast in the king's
banqueting-hall.</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

The Winning of Emer</P>

</B>
<P>
Next day he went to the d&#363;n of Forgall
the Wily, father of Emer, and he leaped &quot;the hero's salmon leap,&quot; that
he had learned of Skatha, over the high ramparts of the d&#363;n. Then the
mighty men of Forgall set on him, and he dealt but three blows, and each blow
slew eight men, and Forgall himself fell lifeless in leaping from the rampart of
the d&#363;n to escape Cuchulain. So he carried off Emer and her foster-sister
and two loads of gold and silver. But outside the dun the sister of Forgall
raised a host against him, and his battle-fury came on him, and furious were the
blows he dealt, so that the ford of Glondath ran blood and the turf on Crofot
was trampled into bloody mire. A hundred he slew at every ford from Olbiny to
the Boyne ; and so was Emer won as she desired, and he brought her to Emain
Macha and made her his wife, and they were not parted again until he died.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Cuchulain Champion of Erin</P>

</B>
<P>
A lord of Ulster named Briccriu of the
Poisoned Tongue once made a feast to which he bade King Conor and all the heroes
of the Red Branch, and because it was always his delight to stir up strife among
men or women he set the heroes contending among themselves as to who was the
champion of the land of Erin. At last it was agreed that the championship</P>

<P>
[195]</P>

<P>
must lie among three of them, namely,
Cuchulain, and Conall of the Victories and Laery the Triumphant. To decide
between these three a demon named The Terrible was summoned from a lake in the
depth of which he dwelt. He proposed to the heroes a test of courage. Any one of
them, he said, might cut off his head to-day provided that he, the claimant of
the championship, would lay down his own head for the axe to-morrow. Conall and
Laery shrank from the test, but Cuchulain accepted it, and after reciting a
charm over his sword, he cut off the head of the demon, who immediately rose,
and taking the bleeding head in one hand and his axe in the other, plunged into
the lake.</P>

<P>
Next day he reappeared, whole and sound, to
claim the fulfilment of the bargain. Cuchulain, quailing but resolute, laid his
head on the block. &quot;Stretch out your neck, wretch,&quot; cried the demon ;
&quot;tis too short for me to strike at.&quot; Cuchulain does as he is bidden.
The demon swings his axe thrice over his victim, brings down the butt with a
crash on the block, and then bids Cuchulain rise unhurt, Champion of Ireland and
her boldest man.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Deirdre and the Sons of Usna</P>

</B>
<P>
We have now to turn to a story in which
Cuchulain takes no part. It is the chief of the preliminary tales to the
Cattle-spoil of Quelgny.</P>

<P>
There was among the lords of Ulster, it is
said, one named Felim son of Dall, who on a certain day made a great feast for
the king. And the king came with his Druid Cathbad, and Fergus mac Roy, and many
heroes of the Red Branch, and while they were making merry over the roasted
flesh and wheaten cakes and Greek wine a messenger from the women's apartments</P>

<P>
[196]</P>

<P>
came to tell Felim that his wife had just
borne him a daughter. So all the lords and warriors drank health to the new-born
infant, and the king bade Cathbade perform divination in the manner of the
Druids and foretell what the future would have in store for Felim's base.
Cathbad gazed upon the stars and drew the horoscope of the child, and he was
much troubled; and at length he said: &quot;The infant shall he fairest among
the women of Erin, and shall wed a king, but because of her shall death and ruin
come upon the Province of Ulster.&quot; Then the warriors would have put her to
death upon the spot, but Conor forbade them. &quot;I will avert the doom,&quot;
he said, &quot;for she shall wed no foreign king, but she shall he my own mate
when she is of age.&quot; So he took away the child, and committed it to his
nurse Levarcam, and the name they gave it was Deirdre. And Conor charged
Levarcam that the child should be brought up in a strong d&#363;n in the
solitude of a great wood, and that no young man should see her or she him until
she was of marriageable age for the king to wed. And there she dwelt, seeing
none but her nurse and Cathbad, and sometime: the king, now growing an aged man,
who would visit the d&#363;n from time to time to see that all was well with the
folk there, and that his commands were observed.</P>

<P>
One day, when the time for the marriage of
Deirdre and Conor was drawing near, Deirdre and Levarcam looked over the rampart
of their dun. It was winter, a heavy snow had fallen in the night, and in the
still, frosty air the trees stood up as if wrought in silver, and the green
before the dun was a sheet of unbroken white, save that in one place a scullion
had killed a calf for their dinner, and the blood of the calf lay on the snow.
And as Deirdre looked, a raven lit down from</P>

<P>
[197]</P>

<P>
a<I> </I>tree hard by and began to sip the
blood. &quot;O nurse,&quot; cried Deirdre suddenly, &quot;such, and not like
Conor, would be the man that I would love-his hair like the raven's wing, and in
his cheek the hue of blood, and his skin as white as snow. &quot;Thou hast
pictured a man of Conor's household,&quot; said the nurse. &quot;Who is he
?&quot; asked Deirdre. &quot;He is Naisi, son of Usna. [see genealogical table,
p. 181] a champion of the Red Branch,&quot; said the nurse. Thereupon Deirdre
entreated Levarcam to bring her to speak with Naisi; and because the old woman
loved the girl and would not have her wedded to the aged king, she at last
agreed. Deirdre implored Naisi to save her from Conor, but he would not, till at
last her entreaties and her beauty won him, and he vowed to be hers. Then
secretly one night he came with his two brethren, Ardan and Ainl&#233;, and bore
away Deirdre with Levarcam, and they escaped the king's pursuit and took ship
for Scotland, where Naisi took service with the King of the Picts. Yet here they
could not rest, for the king got sight of Deirdre, and would have taken her from
Naisi, but Naisi with his brothers escaped, and in the solitude of Glen Etive
they made their dwelling by the lake, and there lived in the wild wood by
hunting and fishing, seeing no man but themselves and their servants.</P>

<P>
And the years went by and Conor made no sign,
but he did not forget, and his spies told him of all that befell Naisi and
Deirdre. At last, judging that Naisi and his brothers would have tired of
solitude, he sent the bosom friend of Naisi, Fergus son of Roy, to bid them
return, and to promise them that all would be forgiven. Fergus went joyfully,
and joyfully did Naisi and his brothers hear the message, but Deirdre foresaw
evil, and would fain have sent Fergus home alone.</P>

<P>
[198]</P>

<P>
But Naisi blamed her for her doubt and
suspicion, and bade her mark that they were under the protection of Fergus,
whose safeguard no king in Ireland would dare to violate; and they at last made
ready to go.</P>

<P>
On landing in Ireland they were met by
Baruch, a lord of the Red Branch, who had his d&#363;n close by, and he bade
Fergus to a feast he had prepared for him that night. &quot; I may not
stay,&quot; said Fergus, &quot;for I must first convey Deirdre and the sons of
Usna safely to Emain Macha&quot; &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; said Baruch,
&quot;thou must stay with me to-night, for it is a <I>geis </I>for thee to
refuse a feast.&quot; Deirdre implored him not to leave them, but Fergus was
tempted by the feast, and feared to break his <I>geis, </I>and he bade his two
sons Illan the Fair and Buino the Red take charge of the party in his place, and
he himself abode with Baruch.</P>

<P>
And so the party came to Emain Macha, and
they were lodged in the House of the Red Branch, but Conor did not receive them.
After the evening meal, as he sat, drinking heavily and silently, he sent a
messenger to bid Levarcam come before him. &quot;How is it with the sons of Usna
? &quot; he said to her. &quot;It is well,&quot; she said. &quot;Thou hast got
the three most valorous champions in Ulster in thy court. Truly the king who has
those three need fear no enemy.&quot; &quot;Is it well with Deirdre ?&quot; he
asked. &quot;She is well,&quot; said the nurse, &quot;but she has lived many
years in the wildwood, and toil and care have changed her - little of her beauty
of old now remains to her, O King.&quot; Then the king dismissed her, and sat
drinking again. But after a while he called to him a servant named Trendorn, and
bade him go to the Red Branch House and mark who was there and what they did.
But when Trendorn came the place was bolted and barred for the night, and he
could not get an entrance, and at last he</P>

<P>
[199]</P>

<P>
mounted on a ladder and looked in at a high
window. And there he saw the brothers of Naisi and the sons of Fergus, as they
talked or cleaned their arms, or made them ready for slumber, and there sat
Naisi with a chess-board before him, and playing chess with him was the fairest
of women that he had ever seen. But as he looked in wonder at the noble pair,
suddenly one caught sight of him and rose with a cry, pointing to the face at
the window. And Naisi looked up and saw it, and seizing a chessman from the
board he hurled it at the face of the spy, and it struck out his eye. Then
Trendorn hastily descended, and went back with his bloody face to the king.
&quot;I have seen them,&quot; he cried, &quot;I have seen the fairest woman of
the world, and but that Naisi had struck my eye out I had been looking on her
still.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then Conor arose and called for his guards
and bade them bring the sons of Usna before him for maiming his messenger. And
the guards went; but first Buino,son of Fergus, with his retinue, met them, and
at the sword's point drove them back; but Naisi and Deirdre continued quietly to
play chess, &quot;For,&quot; said Naisi, &quot;it is not seemly that we should
seek to defend ourselves while we are under the protection of the sons of
Fergus.&quot; But Conor went to Buino, and with a great gift of lands he bought
him over to desert his charge. Then Illan took up the defence of the Red Branch
Hostel, but the two sons of Conor slew him. And then at last Naisi and his
brothers seized their weapons and rushed amid the foe, and many were they who
fell before the onset. Then Conor entreated Cathbad the Druid to cast spells
upon them lest they should get away and become the enemies of the province, and
he vowed to do them no hurt if they were taken alive. So Cathbad conjured up, as
it were, a lake of slime that seemed to be about</P>

<P>
[200]</P>

<P>
the feet of the sons of Usna, and they could
not tear their feet from it, and Naisi caught up Deirdre and put her on his
shoulder, for they seemed to be sinking in the slime. Then the guards and
servants of Conor seized and bound them and brought them before the king. And
the king called upon man after man to come forward and slay the sons of Usna,
but none would obey him, till at last Owen son of Duracht and Prince of Ferney
came and took the sword of Naisi, and with one sweep he shore off the heads of
all three, and so they died.</P>

<P>
Then Conor took Deirdre perforce, and for a
year she abode with him in the palace in Emain Macha, but during all that time
she never smiled. At length Conor said: &quot;What is it that you hate most of
all on earth, Deirdre ?&quot; And she said : &quot;Thou thyself and Owen son of
Duracht,&quot; and Owen was standing by. &quot;Then thou shalt go to Owen for a
year,&quot; said Conor. But when Deirdre mounted the chariot behind Owen she
kept her eyes on the ground, for she would not look on those who thus tormented
her; and Conor said, taunting her : &quot;Deirdre, the glance of thee between me
and Owen is the glance of a ewe between two rams.&quot; Then Deirdre started up,
and, flinging herself head foremost from the chariot, she dashed her head
against a rock and fell dead.</P>

<P>
And when they buried her it is said there
grew from her grave and from Naisi's two yew-trees, whose tops, when they were
full-grown, met each other over the roof of the great church of Armagh, and
intertwined together, and none could part them.</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

The Rebellion of Fergus</P>

</B>
<P>
When Fergus mac Roy came home to Emain Macha
after the feast to which Baruch bade him and found</P>

<P>
[201]</P>

<P>
the sons of Usna slain and one of his own
sons dead and the other a traitor, he broke out against Conor in a storm of
wrath and cursing, and vowed to be avenged on him with fire and sword. And he
went off straightway to Connacht to take service of arms with Ailell and Maev,
who were king and queen of that country.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Queen Maev</P>

</B>
<P>
But though Ailell was king, Maev was the
ruler in truth, and ordered all things as she wished, and took what husbands she
wished, and dismissed them at pleasure; for she was as fierce and strong as a
goddess of war, and knew no law but her own wild will. She was tall, it is said,
with a long, pale face and masses of hair yellow as ripe corn. When Fergus came
to her in her palace at Rathcroghan in Roscommon she gave him her love, as she
had given it to many before, and they plotted together how to attack and
devastate the Province of Ulster.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Brown Bull of Quelgny</P>

</B>
<P>
Now it happened that Maev possessed a famous
red bull with white front and horns named Finnbenach, and one day when she and
Ailell were counting up their respective possessions and matching them against
each other he taunted her because the Finnbenach would not stay in the hands of
a woman, but had attached himself to Ailell's herd. So Maev in vexation went to
her steward, mac Roth, and asked of him if there were anywhere in Erin a bull as
fine as the Finnbenach. &quot;Truly,&quot; said the steward, &quot;there is -
for the Brown Bull of Quelgny, that belongs to Dara son of Fachtna, is the
mightiest beast that is in Ireland.&quot; And after that Maev felt as if she had
no flocks and</P>

<P>
[202]</P>

<P>
herds that were worth anything at all unless
she possessed the Brown Bull of Quelgny. But this was in Ulster, and the
Ulstermen knew the treasure they possessed, and Maev knew that they would not
give up the hull without fighting for it. So she and Fergus and Ailell agreed to
make a foray against Ulster for the Brown Bull, and thus to enter into war with
the province, for Fergus longed for vengeance, and Maev for fighting, for glory,
and for the bull, and Audi to satisfy Maev.</P>

<P>
Here let us note that this contest for the
bull, which is the ostensible theme of the greatest of Celtic legendary tales,
the &quot;Tam Bo Cuailgn&#233;,&quot; has a deeper meaning than appears on the
surface. An ancient piece of Aryan mythology is embedded in it. The Brown Bull
is the Celtic counterpart of the Hindu sky-deity, Indra, represented in Hindu
myth as a mighty bull, whose roaring is the thunder and who lets loose the rains
&quot;like cows streaming forth to pasture.&quot; The advance of the Western
(Connacht) host for the capture of this bull is emblematic of the onset of
Night. The bull is defended by the solar hero Cuchulain, who, however, is
ultimately overthrown and the bull is captured for a season. The two animals in
the Celtic legend probably typify the sky in different aspects. They are
described with a pomp and circumstance which shows that they are no common
beasts. Once, we are told, they were swineherds of the people of Dana.
&quot;They had been successively transformed into two ravens, two sea-monsters,
two warriors, two demons, two worms or animalculae, and finally into two
kine.&quot; [Miss Hull, &quot;The Cuchullin Saga,&quot; p. Ixxii, where the
solar theory of the Brown Bull is dealt with at length.] The Brown Bull is
described as having a back broad enough for fifty children to play on ; when he
is angry with his keeper he stamps the</P>

<P>
[203]</P>

<P>
man thirty feet into the ground; he is
likened to a sea wave, to a boar, to a dragon, a lion, the writer heaping up
images of strength and savagery. We are therefore concerned with no ordinary
cattle-raid, but with a myth, the features of which are discernible under the
dressing given it by the fervid imagination of the unknown Celtic bard who
composed the &quot;Tain,&quot; although the exact meaning of every detail may be
difficult to ascertain.</P>

<P>
The first attempt of Maev to get possession
of the bull was to send an embassy to Dara to ask for the loan of him for a
year, the recompense offered being fifty heifers, besides the bull himself back,
and if Dara chose to settle in Connacht he should have as much land there as he
now possessed in Ulster, and a chariot worth thrice seven <I>cumals, </I>[A <I>cumal</I>
was the unit of value in Celtic Ireland. It is mentioned as such by St. Patrick.
It meant the price of a woman-slave.] with the patronage and friendship of Maev.</P>

<P>
Dara was at first delighted with the
prospect, but tales were borne to him of the chatter of Maev's messengers, and
how they said that if the bull was not yielded willingly it would be taken by
force; and he sent back a message of refusal and defiance. &quot; 'Twas
known,&quot; said Maev, &quot;the bull will not be yielded by fair means; he
shall now be won by foul.&quot; And so she sent messengers around on every side
to summon her hosts for the Raid.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Hosting of Queen Maev</P>

</B>
<P>
And there came all the mighty men of Connacht
- first the seven Main&#233;s, sons of Ailell and Maev, each with his retinue; and
Ket and Anluan, sons of Maga, with thirty hundreds of armed men; and
yellow-haired Ferdia, with his company of Firbolgs, boisterous giants</P>

<P>
[204]</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
who delighted in war and in strong ale. And
there came also the allies of Maev - host of the men of Leinster, who so
excelled the rest in warlike skill that they were broken up and distributed
among the companies of Connacht, lest they should prove a danger to the host;
and Cormac son of Conor, with Fergus mac Roy and other exiles from Ulster, who
had revolted against Conor for his treachery to the sons of Usna.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Ulster under the Curse</P>

</B>
<P>
But before the host set forth towards Ulster
Maev sent her<I> </I>spies into the land to tell her of the preparations there
being made. And the spies brought back a wondrous tale, and one that rejoiced
the heart of Maev, for they said that the Debility of the Ultonians [the curse
laid on them by Macha. See p. 180] had descended on the province. Conor the king
lay in pangs at Emain Macha, and his son Cuscrid in his island-fortress, and
Owen Prince of Ferney was helpless as a child; Celtchar, the huge grey warrior,
son of Uthecar Hornskin, and even Conall of the Victories, lay moaning and
writhing on their beds, and there was no hand in Ulster that could lift a spear.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Prophetic Voices</P>

</B>
<P>
Nevertheless Maev went to her chief Druid,
and demanded of him what her own lot in the war should be. And the Druid said
only: &quot;Whoever comes back in safety, or comes not, thou thyself shalt
come.&quot; But on her journey back she saw suddenly standing before her
chariot-pole a young maiden with tresses of yellow hair that fell below her
knees, and clad in a mantle of green ; and with a shuttle of gold she wove a
fabric upon a loom. &quot;Who art thou, girl ?&quot; said Maev,</P>

<P>
[205]</P>

<P>
&quot;and what dost thou ?&quot; &quot;I am
the prophetess, Fedelma, from the Fairy Mound of Croghan,&quot; said the maid,
&quot;and I weave the four provinces of Ireland together for the foray into
Ulster.&quot; &quot;How seest thou our host ? &quot; asked Maev. &quot;I see
them all be-crimsoned, red,&quot; replied the prophetess. &quot;Yet the Ulster
heroes are all in their pangs - there is none that can lift a spear against
us,&quot; said Maev. &quot;I see the host all be-crimsoned,&quot; said Fedelma.
&quot;I see a man of small stature, but the hero's light is on his brow - a
stripling young and modest, but in battle a dragon; he is like unto Cuchulain of
Murthemney; he doth wondrous feats with his weapons ; by him your slain shall
lie thickly.&quot; [Cuchulain, as the son of the god Lugh, was not subject to
the curse of Macha which afflicted the other Ultonians.]</P>

<P>
At this the vision of the weaving maiden
vanished, and Maev drove homewards to Rathcroghan wondering at what she had seen
and heard.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Cuchulain Puts the Host under Geise</P>

</B>
<P>
On the morrow the host set forth, Fergus mac
Roy leading them, and as they neared the confines of Ulster he bade them keep
sharp watch lest Cuchulain of Murthemney, who guarded the passes of Ulster to
the south, should fall upon them unawares. Now Cuchulain and his father Sualtam
[His reputed father, the mortal husband of Dectera] were on the borders of the
province, and Cuchulain, from a warning Fergus had sent him, suspected the
approach of a great host, and bade Sualtam go northwards to Emania and warn the
men of Ulster. But Cuchulain himself would not stay there, for he said he had a
tryst to keep with a handmaid of the wife of Laery the <I>bodach </I>(farmer),
so he went into the forest, and there, standing on one leg,</P>

<P>
[206]</P>

<P>
and using only one hand and one eye, he cut
an oak sapling and twisted it into a circular withe. On this he cut in Ogham
characters how the withe was made, and he put the host of Maev under <I>geise </I>not
to pass by that place till one of them had, under similar conditions, made a
similar withe ; &quot;and I except my friend Fergus mac Roy,&quot; he added, and
wrote his name at the end. Then he placed the withe round the pillar-stone of
Ardcullin, and went his way to keep his tryst with the handmaid. [In the Irish
bardic literature, as in the Homeric epics, chastity formed no part of the
masculine ideal either for gods or men.]</P>

<P>
When the host of Maev came to Ardcullin, the
withe upon the pillar-stone was found and brought to Fergus to decipher it.
There was none amongst the host who could emulate the feat of Cuchulain, and so
they went into the wood and encamped for the night. A heavy snowfall took place,
and they were all in much distress, but next day the sun rose gloriously, and
over the white plain they marched away into Ulster, counting the prohibition as
extending only for one night.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Ford of the Forked Pole</P>

</B>
<P>
Cuchulain now followed hard on their track,
and as he went he estimated by the tracks they had left the number of the host
at eighteen <I>triucha c&#233;t </I>(54,000<I> </I>men). Circling round the host, he
now met them in front, and soon came upon two chariots containing scouts sent
ahead by Maev. These he slew, each man with his driver, and having with one
sweep of his sword cut a forked pole of four prongs from the wood, he drove the
pole deep into a river-ford at the place called Athgowla, [&quot;The Ford of the
Forked Pole&quot;] and impaled on each prong a bloody head. When the host came
up they wondered and feared at</P>

<P>
[207]</P>

<P>
the sight, and Fergus declared that they were
under <I>geise </I>not to pass that ford till one of them had plucked out the
pole even as it was driven in, with the finger-tips of one hand. So Fergus drove
into the water to essay the feat, and seventeen chariots were broken under him
as he tugged it the pole, but at list he tore it out; and as it was now late the
host encamped upon the spot. These devices of Cuchulain were intended to delay
the invaders until the Ulster men had recovered from their debility.</P>

<P>
In the epic, as given in the Book of
Leinster, and other ancient sources, a long interlude now takes place in which
Fergus explains to Maev who it is - viz., &quot;my little pupil Setanta &quot; -
who is thus harrying the host, and his boyish deeds, some of which have been
already told in this narrative, are recounted.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Charioteer of Orlam</P>

</B>
<P>
The host proceeded on its way next day, and
the next encounter with Cuchulain showing. the hero in a kindlier mood. He hears
a noise of timber being cut, and going into a wood he finds there a charioteer
belonging to a son of Ailell and Maev cutting down chariot-poles of holly.
&quot;For,&quot; says he, &quot;we have damaged our chariots sadly in chasing
that furious deer, Cuchulain.&quot; Cuchulain - who, it must be remembered, was
at ordinary times a slight and unimposing figure, though in battle he dilated in
size and underwent a fearful distortion, symbolic of Berserker fury - helps the
driver in his work. &quot;Shall I,&quot; he asks, &quot;cut the poles or trim
them for thee?&quot; &quot;Do thou the trimming,&quot; says the driver.
Cuchulain takes the poles by the tops and draws them against the set of the
branches through his toes, and then runs his fingers down them the same way, and
gives them over as smooth and</P>

<P>
[208]</P>

<P>
polished as if they were planed by a
carpenter. The driver stares at him. &quot;I doubt this work I set thee to is
not thy proper work,&quot; he says. &quot;Who art thou then at all?&quot;
&quot;I am that Cuchulain of whom thou spakest but now &quot; &quot;Surely I am
but a dead man,&quot; says the driver. &quot; Nay,&quot; replies Cuchulain,
&quot;I slay not drivers nor messengers nor men unarmed. But run, tell thy
master Orlam that Cuchulain is about to visit him.&quot; The driver runs off;
but Cuchulain outstrips him, meets Orlam first, and strikes off his head. For a
moment the host of Maev see him as he shakes this bloody trophy before them ;
then he disappears from sight - it is the first glimpse they have caught of
their persecutor.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Battle-Frenzy of Cuchulain</P>

</B>
<P>
A number of scattered episodes now follow.
The host of Maev spreads out and devastates the territories of Bregia and of
Murthemney, but they cannot advance further into Ulster. Cuchulain hovers about
them continually, slaying them by twos and threes, and no man knows where he
will swoop next. Maev herself is awed when, by the bullets of an unseen slinger,
a squirrel and a pet bird are killed as they sit upon her shoulders. Afterwards,
as Cuchulain's wrath grows fiercer, he descends with supernatural might upon
whole companies of the Connacht host, and hundreds fall at his onset. The
characteristic distortion or <I>riastradh </I>which seized him in his
battle-frenzy is then described. He became a fearsome and multiform creature
such as never was known before. Every particle of him quivered like a bulrush in
a running stream. His calves and heels and hams shifted to the front, and his
feet and knees to the back, and the muscles of his neck stood out like the head
of a young child. One</P>

<P>
[209]</P>

<P>
eye was engulfed deep in his head, the other
protruded, his mouth met his ears, foam poured from his jaws like the fleece of
a three-year-old wether. The beats of his heart sounded like the roars of a lion
as he rushes on his prey. A light blazed above his head, and &quot;his hair
became tangled about as it had been the branches of a red thorn-bush stuffed
into the gap of a fence &#133;</P>

<P>
Taller, thicker, more rigid, longer than the
mast of a great ship was the perpendicular jet of dusky blood which out of his
scalp's very central point shot upwards and was there scattered to the four
cardinal points, whereby was formed a magic mist of gloom resembling the smoky
pall that drapes a regal dwelling, what time a king at nightfall of a winter's
day draws near to it.&quot; [I quote from Standish Hayes O'Grady's translation,
in Miss Hull's &quot;Cuchullin Saga.&quot;]</P>

<P>
Such was the imagery by which Gaelic writers
conveyed the idea of superhuman frenzy. At the sight of Cuchulain in his
paroxysm it is said that once a hundred of Maev's warriors fell dead from
horror.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Compact of the Ford</P>

</B>
<P>
Maev now tried to tempt him by great largesse
to desert the cause of Ulster, and had a colloquy with him, the two standing on
opposite sides of a glen across which they talked. She scanned him closely, and
was struck by his slight and boyish appearance. She failed to move him from his
loyalty to Ulster, and death descends more thickly than ever upon the Connacht
host ; the men are afraid to move out for plunder save in twenties and thirties,
and at night the stones from Cuchulain's sling whistle continually through the
camp, braining or maiming. At last, through the mediation of Fergus, an
agreement was come to. Cuchulain undertook not to harry the host provided they
would</P>

<P>
[210]</P>

<P>
only send against him one champion at a time,
whom Cuchulain would meet in battle at the ford of the River Dee, which is now
called the Ford of Ferdia. [<I>Ath Fherdia, </I>which is pronounced and now
spelt &quot;Ardee.&quot; It is in Co. Louth, at the southern border of the Plain
of Murthemney, which was Cuchulain's territory.] While each right was in
progress the host might move on, but when it was ended they must encamp till the
morrow morning. &quot;Better to lose one man a day than a hundred,&quot; said
Maev, and the pact was made.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Fergus and Cuchulain</P>

</B>
<P>
Several single combats are then narrated, in
which Cuchulain is always a victor. Maev even persuades Fergus to go against
him, but Fergus and Cuchulain will on no account right each other, and
Cuchulain, by agreement with Fergus, pretends to fly before him, on Fergus's
promise that he will do the same for Cuchulain when required. How this pledge
was kept we shall see later.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Capture of the Brown Bull</P>

</B>
<P>
During one of Cuchulain's duels with a famous
champion, Natchrantal, Maev, with a third of her army, makes a sudden foray into
Ulster and penetrates as far as Dunseverick, on the northern coast, plundering
and ravaging as they go. The Brown Bull, who was originally at Quelgny (Co.
Down), has been warned at an earlier stage by the Morrigan [see p. 126] to
withdraw himself, and he has taken refuge, with his herd of cows, in a glen of
Slievegallion, Co. Armagh. The raiders of Maev find him there, and drive him off
with the herd in triumph, passing Cuchulain as they return. Cuchulain slays the
leader of the escort - Buic son of Banblai - but cannot</P>

<P>
[211]</P>

<P>
rescue the Bull, and &quot;this,&quot; it is
said, &quot;was the greatest affront put on Cuchulain during the course of the
raid.&quot;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Morrigan</P>

</B>
<P>
The raid ought now to have ceased, for its
object has been attained, but by this time the hostings of the four southern
provinces [In ancient Ireland there were five provinces, Munster being counted
as<I> </I>two, or, as some ancient authorities explain it, the High King's
territory in Meath and Westmeath being reckoned a separate province.] had
gathered together under Maev for the plunder of Ulster, and Cuchulain remained
still the solitary warder of the marches. Nor did Maev keep her agreement, for
bands of twenty warriors at a time were loosed against him and he had much ado
to defend himself. The curious episode of the fight with the Morrigan now
occurs. A young woman clad in a mantle of many colours appears to Cuchulain,
telling him that she is a king's daughter, attracted by the tales of his great
exploits, and she has come to offer him her love. Cuchulain tells her rudely
that he is worn and harassed with war and has no mind to concern himself with
women. &quot; It shall go hard with thee,&quot; then said the maid, &quot;when
thou hast to do with men, and I shall be about thy feet as an eel in the bottom
of the Ford.&quot; Then she and her chariot vanished from his sight and he saw
but a crow sitting on a branch of a tree, and he knew that he had spoken with
the Morrigan.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Fight with Loch</P>

</B>
<P>
The next champion sent against him by Maev
was Loch son of Mofebis. To meet this hero it is said that Cuchulain had to
stain his chin with blackberry juice so as to simulate a beard, lest Loch should
disdain to do combat with a boy. So they fought in the Ford, and the</P>

<P>
[212]</P>

<P>
Morrigan came against him in the guise of a
white heifer with red ears, but Cuchulain fractured her eye with a cast of his
spear. Then she came swimming up the river like a black eel and twisted herself
about his legs, and ere he could rid himself of her Loch wounded him. Then she
attacked him as a grey wolf, and again, before he could subdue her, he was
wounded by Loch. At this his battle-fury took hold of him and he drove the Gae
Bolg against Loch, splitting his heart in two. &quot;Suffer me to rise,&quot;
said Loch, &quot;that I may fall on my face on thy side of the ford, and not
backward toward the men of Erin.&quot; &quot;It is a warrior's boon thou
askest,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;and it is granted.&quot; So Loch died; and a
great despondency, it is said, now fell upon Cuchulain, for he was outwearied
with continued fighting, and sorely wounded, and he had never slept since the
beginning of the raid, save leaning upon his spear; and he sent his charioteer,
Laeg, to see if he could rouse the men of Ulster to come to his aid at last.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Lugh the Protector</P>

</B>
<P>
But as he lay at evening by the grave-mound
of Lerga in gloom and dejection, watching the camp-fires of the vast army
encamped over against him and the glitter of their innumerable spears, he saw
coming through the host a tall and comely warrior who strode impetuously
forward, and none of the companies through which he passed turned his head to
look at him or seemed to see him. He wore a tunic of silk embroidered with gold,
and a green mantle fastened with a silver brooch; in one hand was a black shield
bordered with silver and two spears in the other. The stranger came to Cuchulain
and spoke gently and sweetly to him of his long toil and waking, and his sore
wounds, and said in the end:</P>

<P>
&quot;Sleep now, Cuchulain, by the grave in
Lerga; sleep</P>

<P>
[213]</P>

<P>
and slumber deeply for three days, and for
that time I will take thy place and defend the Ford against the host of
Maev.&quot; Then Cuchulain sank into a profound slumber and trance, and the
stranger laid healing balms of magical power to his wounds so that he awoke
whole and refreshed, and for the time that Cuchulain slept the stranger held the
Ford against the host. And Cuchulain knew that this was Lugh his father, who had
come from among the People of Dana to help his son through his hour of gloom and
despair.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Sacrifice of the Boy Corps</P>

</B>
<P>
But still the men of Ulster lay helpless. Now
there was at Emain Macha a band of thrice fifty boys, the sons of all the
chieftains of the provinces, who were there being bred up in arms and in noble
ways, and these suffered not from the curse of Macha, for it fell only on grown
men. But when they heard of the sore straits in which Cuchulain, their playmate
not long ago, was lying they put on their light armour and took their weapons
and went forth for the honour of Ulster, under Conor's young son, Follaman, to
aid him. And Follaman vowed that he would never return to Emania without the
diadem of Ailell as a trophy. Three times they drove against the host of Maev,
and thrice their own number fell before them, but in the end they were
overwhelmed and slain, not one escaping alive.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Carnage of Murthemney</P>

</B>
<P>
This was done as Cuchulain lay in his trance,
and when he awoke, refreshed and well, and heard what had been done, his frenzy
came upon him and he leaped into his war-chariot and drove furiously round and
round the host of Maev. And the chariot ploughed the earth till the ruts were
like the ramparts of a</P>

<P>
[214]</P>

<P>
fortress, and the scythes upon its wheels
caught and mangled the bodies of the crowded host till they were piled like a
wall around the camp, and as Cuchulain shouted in his wrath the demons and
goblins and wild things in Erin yelled in answer, so that with the terror and
the uproar the host of men heaved and surged hither and thither, and many
perished from each other's weapons, and many from horror and fear. And this was
the great carnage, called the Carnage of Murthemney, that Cuchulain did to
avenge the boy-corps of Emania ; six score and ten princes were then slain of
the host of Maev, besides horses and women and wolf-dogs and common folk without
number. It is said that Lugh mac Ethlinn fought there by his son.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Clan Calatin</P>

</B>
<P>
Next the men of Erin resolved to send against
Cuchulain, in single combat, the Clan Calatin. [&quot;Clan&quot; in Gaelic means
children or offspring. Clan Calatin = the sons of Calatin] Now Calatin was a
wizard, and he and his seven-and-twenty sons formed, as it were, but one being,
the sons being organs of their father, and what any one of them did they all did
alike. They were all poisonous, so that any weapon which one of them used would
kill in nine days the man who was but grazed by it. When this multiform creature
met Cuchulain each hand of it hurled a spear at once, but Cuchulain caught the
twenty-eight spears on his shield and not one of them drew blood. Then he drew
his sword to lop off the spears that bristled from his shield, but as he did so
the Clan Calatin rushed upon him and flung him down, thrusting his face into the
gravel. At this Cuchulain gave a great cry of distress at the unequal combat,
and one of</P>

<P>
[215]</P>

<P>
the Ulster exile; Fiacha son of Firaba, who
was with the host of Maev, and was looking on at the fight, could not endure to
see the plight of the champion, and he drew his sword and with one stroke he
lopped off the eight-and-twenty hands that were grinding the face of Cuchulain
into the gravel of the Ford. Then Cuchulain arose and hacked the Clan Calatin
into fragments, so that none survived to tell Maev what Fiacha had done, else
had he and his thirty hundred followers of Clan Rury heen given by Maev to the
edge of the sword.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Ferdia to the Fray</P>

</B>
<P>
Cuchulain had now overcome all the mightiest
of Maev's men, save only the mightiest of them all after Fergus, Ferdia son of
Daman. And because Ferdia was the old friend and fellow pupil of Cuchulain he
had never gone out against him; but now Maev begged him to go, and he would not.
Then she offered him her daughter, Findabair of the Fair Eyebrows, to wife, if
he would face Cuchulain at the Ford, but he would not. At last she bade him go,
lest the poets and satirists of Erin should make verses on him and put him to
open shame, and then in wrath and sorrow he consented to go, and bade his
charioteer make ready for to-morrow's fray. Then was gloom among all his people
when they heard of that, for they knew that if Cuchulain and their master met,
one of them would return alive no more.</P>

<P>
Very early in the morning Ferdia drove to the
Ford, and lay down there on the cushions and skins of the chariot and slept till
Cuchulain should come. Not till it was full daylight did Ferdia's charioteer
hear the thunder of Cuchulain's war-car approaching, and then he woke his
master, and the two friends faced each</P>

<P>
[216]</P>

<P>
other across the Ford. And when they had
greeted each other Cuchulain said: &quot;It is not thou, O Ferdia, who shouldst
have come to do battle with me. When we were with Skatha did we not go side by
side in every battle, through every wood and wilderness ? were we not
heart-companions, comrades, in the feast and the assembly ? did we not share one
bed and one deep slumber ?&quot; But Ferdia replied : &quot;O Cuchulain, thou of
the wondrous feats, though we have studied poetry and science together, and
though I have heard thee recite our deeds of friendship, yet it is my hand that
shall wound thee. I bid thee remember not our comradeship, O Hound of Ulster; it
shall not avail thee, it shall not avail thee.&quot;</P>

<P>
They then debated with what weapons they
should begin the fight, and Ferdia reminded Cuchulain of the art of casting
small javelins that they had learned from Skatha, and they agreed to begin with
these. Back-wards and forwards, then, across the Ford, hummed the light javelins
like bees on a summer's day, but when noonday had come not one weapon had
pierced the defence of either champion. Then they took to the heavy missile
spears, and now at last blood began to flow, for each champion wounded the other
time and again. At last the day came to its close. &quot;Let us cease now,&quot;
said Ferdia, and Cuchulain agreed. Each then threw his arms to his charioteer,
and the friends embraced and kissed each other three times, and went to their
rest. Their horses were in the same paddock, their drivers warmed themselves
over the same fire, and the heroes sent each other food and drink and healing
herbs for their wounds.</P>

<P>
Next day they betook themselves again to the
Ford, and this time, because Ferdia had the choice of weapons the day before, he
bade Cuchulain take it</P>

<P>
[217]</P>

<P>
now. [Together with much that is wild and
barbaric in this Irish epic of the &quot;Tain&quot; the reader will be struck by
the ideals of courtesy and gentleness which not infrequently come to light in
it. It must be remembered that, as Mr. A. H. Leahy points out in his &quot;
Heroic Romances of Ireland,&quot; the legend of the Raid of Quelgny is, at the
very latest, a century earlier than all other known romances of chivalry Welsh
or Continental. It is found in the &quot;Book of Leinster,&quot; a<I> </I>manuscript
of the twelfth century, as well as in other sources, and was doubtless
considerably older than the date of its transcription there. &quot;The whole
thing,&quot; says Mr. Leahy, &quot;stands at the very beginning of the
literature of modern Europe.&quot;] Cuchulain chose then the heavy, broad-bladed
spears for close fighting, and with them they fought from the chariots till the
sun went down, and drivers and horses were weary, and the body of each hero was
torn with wounds. Then at last they gave over, and threw away their weapons. And
they kissed each other as before, and as before they shared all things at night,
and slept peacefully till the morning.</P>

<P>
When the third day of the combat came Ferdia
wore an evil and lowering look, and Cuchulain reproached him for coming out in
battle against his comrade for the bribe of a fair maiden, even Findabair, whom
Maev had offered to every champion and to Cuchulain himself if the Ford might be
won thereby; but Ferdia said : &quot;Noble Hound, had I not faced thee when
summoned, my troth would be broken, and there would be shame on me in
Rathcroghan.&quot; It is now the turn of Ferdia to choose the weapons, and they
betake themselves to their &quot; heavy, hard-smiting swords, and though they
hew from each other's thighs and shoulders great cantles of flesh, neither can
prevail over the other, and at last night ends the combat. This time they parted
from each other in heaviness and gloom, and there was no interchange of friendly
acts, and their drivers and horses slept apart. The passions of the warriors had
now risen to a grim sternness.</P>

<P>
[218]</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Death of Ferdia</P>

</B>
<P>
On the fourth day Ferdia knew the contest
would be decided, and he armed himself with especial care. Next his skin was a
tunic of striped silk bordered with golden spangles, and over that hung an apron
of brown leather. Upon his belly he laid a flat stone, large as a millstone, and
over that a strong, deep apron of iron, for he dreaded that Cuchulain would use
the Gae Bolg that day. And he put on his head his crested helmet studded with
carbuncle and inlaid with enamels, and girt on his golden-hilted sword, and on
his left arm hung his broad shield with its fifty bosses of bronze. Thus he
stood by the Ford, and as he waited he tossed up his weapons and caught them
again and did many wonderful feats, playing with his mighty weapons as a juggler
plays with apples; and Cuchulain, watching him, said to Laeg, his driver
&quot;If I give ground to-day, do thou reproach and mock me and spur me on to
valour, and praise and hearten me if I do well, for I shall have need of all my
courage.</P>

<P>
&quot;O Ferdia,&quot; said Cuchulain when
they met, &quot;what shall be our weapons to-day ?&quot; &quot;It is thy choice
today,&quot; said Ferdia. &quot;Then let it be all or any,&quot; said Cuchulain,
and Ferdia was cast down at hearing this, but he said, &quot;So be it,&quot; and
thereupon the fight began. Till midday they fought with spears, and none could
gain any advantage over the other. Then Cuchulain drew his sword and sought to
smite Ferdia over the rim of his shield ; but the giant Firbolg flung him off<I>.
</I>Thrice Cuchulain leaped high into the air, seeking to strike Ferdia over his
shield, but each time as he descended Ferdia caught him upon the shield and
flung him off like a little child into the Ford. And Laeg mocked him, crying :
&quot;He casts thee off as a river flings</P>

<P>
[219]</P>

<P>
its foam, he grinds thee as a millstone
grinds a corn of wheat ; thou elf, never call thyself a warrior.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then at last Cuchulain's frenzy came upon
him, and he dilated giant-like, till he overtopped Ferdia, and the hero-light
blazed about his head. In close contact the two were interlocked, whirling and
trampling, while the demons and goblins and unearthly things of the glens
screamed from the edges of their swords, and the waters of the Ford recoiled in
terror from them, so that for a while they fought on dry land in the midst of
the riverbed. And now Ferdia found Cuchulain a moment oft his guard, and smote
him with the edge of the sword, and it sank deep into his flesh, and all the
river ran red with his blood. And he pressed Cuchulain sorely after that, hewing
and thrusting so that Cuchulain could endure it no longer, and he shouted to
Laeg to fling him the Gae BoIg. When Ferdia heard that he lowered his shield to
guard himself from below, and Cuchulain drove his spear over the rim of the
shield and through his breastplate into his chest. And Ferdia raised his shield
again, but in that moment Cuchulain seized the Gae Bolg in his toes and drove it
upward against Ferdia, and it pierced through the iron apron and burst in three
the millstone that guarded him, and deep into his body it passed, so that every
crevice and cranny of him was filled with its barbs. &quot; 'Tis enough,&quot;
cried Ferdia; &quot; I have my death of that. It is an ill deed that I fall by
thy hand, O Cuchulain.&quot; Cuchulain seized him as he fell, and carried him
northward across the Ford, that he might die on the further side of it, and not
on the side of the men of Erin. Then he laid him down, and a faintness seized
Cuchulain, and he was falling, when Laeg cried : &quot;Rise up, Cuchulain, for
the host of Erin will be upon us. No single combat will they give after Ferdia
has fallen.&quot; But Cuchulain said: &quot;Why should</P>

<P>
[220]</P>

<P>
I rise again, O my servant, now he that lieth
here has fallen by my hand ?&quot; and he fell in a swoon like death. And the
host of Maev with tumult and rejoicing, with tossing of spears and shouting of
war-songs, poured across the border into Ulster.</P>

<P>
But before they left the Ford they took the
body of Ferdia and laid it in a grave, and built a mound over him and set up a
pillar-stone with his name and lineage in Ogham<I>. </I>And from Ulster came
certain of the friends of Cuchulain, and they bore him away into Murthemney,
where they washed him and bathed his wounds in the streams, and his kin among
the Danaan Folk cast magical herbs into the rivers for his healing. But he lay
there in weakness and in stupor for many days.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Rousing of Ulster</P>

</B>
<P>
Now Sualtam, the father of Cuchulain, had
taken his son's horse, the Grey of Macha, and ridden off again to see if by any
means he might rouse the men of Ulster to defend the province. And he went
crying abroad &quot;The men of Ulster are being slain, the women carried
captive, the kine driven ! &quot; Yet they stared on him stupidly, as though
they knew not of what he spake. At last he came to Emania, and there were
Cathbad the Druid and Conor the King, and all their nobles and lords, and
Sualtam cried aloud to them : &quot;The men of Ulster are being slain, the women
carried captive, the kine driven ; and Cuchulain alone holds the gap of Ulster
against the four provinces of Erin. Arise and defend yourselves I&quot; But
Cathbad only said &quot;Death were the due of him who thus disturbs the
King&quot;; and Conor said : &quot; Yet it is true what the man says&quot;; and
the lords of Ulster wagged their heads and murmured: &quot;True indeed it
is.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then Sualtam wheeled round his horse in anger
and</P>

<P>
[221]</P>

<P>
was about to depart when, with a start which
the Grey made, his neck fell against the sharp rim of the shield upon his back,
and it shore off his head, and the head fell on the ground. Yet still it cried
its message as it lay, and at last Conor bade put it on a pillar that it might
be at rest. But it still went on crying and exhorting, and at length into the
clouded mind of the king the truth began to penetrate, and the glazed eyes of
the warriors began to glow, and slowly the spell of Macha's curse was lifted
from their minds and bodies. Then Conor arose and swore a mighty oath, saying
&quot;The heavens are above us and the earth beneath us, and the sea is round
about us; and surely, unless the heavens fall on us and the earth gape to
swallow us up, and the sea overwhelm the earth, I will restore every woman to
her hearth, and every cow to its byre.&quot; [Another instance of the survival
of the oath formula recited by the Celtic envoys to Alexander the Great. See
p.23.] His Druid proclaimed that the hour was propitious, and the king bade his
messengers go forth on every side and summon Ulster to arms, and he named to
them warriors long dead as well as the living, for the cloud of the curse still
lingered in his brain.</P>

<P>
With the curse now departed from them the men
of Ulster flocked joyfully to the summons, and on every hand there was grinding
of spears and swords, and buckling on of armour and harnessing of war-chariots
for the rising-out of the province. [&quot;Rising-out&quot; is the vivid
expression wed by Irish writers for a clan or territory going on the war-path.
&quot;Hosting&quot; is also used in a similar sense.] One host came under Conor
the King and Keltchar, son of Uthecar Hornskin, from Emania southwards, and
another from the west along the very track of the host of Maev. And Conor's host
fell upon eight score of</P>

<P>
[222]</P>

<P>
the men of Erin in Meath, who were carrying
away a great booty of women-captives, and they slew every man of the eight score
and rescued the women. Maev and her host then fell<I> </I>back toward Connacht,
but when they reached Slemon Midi, the Hill of Slane, in Meath, the Ulster bands
joined each other there and prepared to give battle. Maev sent her messenger mac
Roth to view the Ulster host on the Plain of Garach and report upon it. Mac Roth
came back with an awe-striking description of what he beheld. When he first
looked he saw the plain covered with deer and other wild beasts. These, explains
Fergus, had been driven out of the forests by the advancing host of the Ulster
men. The second time mac Roth looked he saw a mist that filled the valleys, the
hill-tops standing above it like islands. Out of the mist there came thunder and
flashes of light, and a wind that nearly threw him off his feet. &quot;What is
this ?&quot; asks Maev, and Fergus tells her that the mist is the deep breathing
of the warriors as they march, and the light is the flashing of their eyes, and
the thunder is the clangour of their war-cars and the dash of their weapons as
they go to the fight &quot;They think they will never reach it,&quot; says
Fergus. &quot;We have warriors to meet them,&quot; says Maev. &quot;You will
need that,&quot; says Fergus, &quot;for in all Ireland, nay, in all the Western
world, to Greece and Scythia and the Tower of Bregon [see p. 130] and the Island
of Gades, there live not who can face the men of Ulster in their wrath.&quot;</P>

<P>
A long passage then follows describing the
appearance and equipment of each of the Ulster chiefs.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Battle of Garach</P>

</B>
<P>
The battle was joined on the Plain of Garach,
in Meath. Fergus, wielding a two-handed sword, the</P>

<P>
[223]</P>

<P>
sword which, it was said, when swung in
battle made circles like the arch of a rainbow, swept down whole ranks of the
Ulster men at each blow, [the sword of Fergus was a fairy weapon called the <I>Caladcholg
</I>(hard dinter), a name of which Arthur's more famous &quot;Excalibur&quot; is
a Latinised corruption] and the fierce Maev charged thrice into the heart of the
enemy.</P>

<P>
Fergus met Conor the King, and smote him on
his golden-bordered shield, but Cormac, the king's son, begged for his father's
life. Fergus then turned on Con all of the Victories.</P>

<P>
&quot;Too hot art thou,&quot; said Conall,
&quot;against thy people and thy race for a wanton.&quot; [the reference is to
Deirdre] Fergus then turned from slaying the Ulstermen, but in his battle-fury
he smote among the hills with his rainbow-sword, and struck off the tops of the
three <I>Maela </I>of Meath, so that they are flat-topped <I>(mael) </I>to this
day.</P>

<P>
Cuchulain in his stupor heard the crash of
Fergus's blows, and coming slowly to himself he asked of Laeg what it meant.
&quot;It is the sword-play of Fergus,&quot; said Laeg. Then he sprang up, and
his body dilated so that the wrappings and swathings that had been bound on him
flew off, and he armed himself and rushed into the battle. Here he met Fergus.
&quot;Turn hither, Fergus,&quot; he shouted; &quot;I will wash thee as foam in a
pool, I will go over thee as the tail goes over a cat, I will smite thee as a
mother smites her infant.&quot; &quot;Who speaks thus to me ?&quot; cried
Fergus. &quot;Cuchulain mac Sualtam; and now do thou avoid me as thou art
pledged.&quot; [see p. 211]</P>

<P>
&quot;I have promised even that,&quot; said
Fergus, and then went out of the battle, and with him the men of Leinster and
the men of Munster, leaving Maev with her seven sons and the hosting of Connacht
alone.</P>

<P>
[224]</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
It was midday when Cuchulain came into the
fight; when the evening sun was shining through the leaves of the trees his
war-chariot was but two wheels and a handful of shattered ribs, and the host of
Connacht was in full flight towards the border. Cuchulain overtook Maev, who
crouched under her chariot and entreated grace. &quot;I am not wont to slay
women,&quot; said Cuchulain, and he protected her till she had crossed the
Shannon at Athlone.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Fight of the<I> </I>Bulls</P>

</B>
<P>
But the Brown Bull of Quelgny, that Macv had
sent into Connacht by a circuitous way, met the white-horned Bull of Ailell on
the Plain of Aei, and the two beasts fought ; but the Brown Bull quickly slew
the other, and tossed his fragments about the land so that pieces of him were
strewn from Rathcroghan to Tara; and then careered madly about till he fell
dead, bellowing and vomiting black gore, at the Ridge of the Bull, between
Ulster and Iveagh. Ailell and Maev made peace with Ulster for seven years, and
the Ulster men returned home to Emain Macha with great glory.</P>

<P>
Thus ends the &quot;Tain Bo Cuailgn&#232;,&quot;
or Cattle Raid of Quelgny; and it was written out in the &quot;Book of
Leinster&quot; in the year 1150 by the hand of Finn mac Gorman, Bishop of
Kildare, and at the end is written &quot;A blessing on all such as faithfully
shall recite the &quot;Tain&quot; as it stands here, and shall not give it in
any other form.</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

Cuchulain in Fairyland</P>

</B>
<P>
One of the strangest tales in Celtic legend
tells how Cuchulain, as he lay asleep after hunting, against a pillar-stone, had
a vision of two Danaan women who came to him armed with rods and alternately
beat</P>

<P>
[225]</P>

<P>
him till he was all but dead, and he could
not lift a hand to defend himself. Next day, and for a year thereafter, he lay
in sore sickness, and none could heal him.</P>

<P>
Then a man whom none knew came and told him
to go to the pillar-stone where he had seen the vision, and he would learn what
was to be done for his recovery. There he found a Danaan woman in a green
mantle, one of those who had chastised him, and she told him that Fand, the
Pearl of Beauty, wife of Mananan the Sea-god, had set her love on him; and she
was at enmity with her husband Mananan; and her realm was besieged by three
demon kings, against whom Cuchulain's help was sought, and the price of his help
would be the love of Fand. Laeg, the charioteer, was then sent by Cuchulain to
report upon Fand and her message. He entered Fairyland, which lies beyond a lake
across which he passed in a magic boat of bronze, and came home with a report of
Fand's surpassing beauty and the wonders of the kingdom; and Cuchulain then
betook himself thither. Here he had a battle in a dense mist with the demons,
who are described as resembling sea-waves - no doubt we are to understand that
they are the folk of the angry husband, Mananan. Then he abode with Fand,
enjoying all the delights of Fairyland for a month, after which he bade her
farewell, and appointed a trysting-place on earth, the Strand of the Yew Tree,
where she was to meet him.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Fand, Emer, and Cuchulain</P>

</B>
<P>
But Emer heard of the tryst; and though not
commonly disturbed at Cuchulain's numerous infidelities, she came on this
occasion with fifty of her maidens armed with sharp knives to slay Fand.
Cuchulain and Fand perceive their chariots from afar, and</P>

<P>
[226]</P>

<P>
the armed angry women with golden clasps
shining on their breasts, and he prepares to protect his mistress. He addresses
Emer in a curious poem, describing the beauty and skill and magical powers of
Fand- &quot; There is nothing the spirit can wish for that she has not
got.&quot; Emer replies : &quot;In good sooth, the lady to whom thou dost cling
seems in no way better than I am, but the new is ever sweet and the well-known
is sour ; thou hast all the wisdom of the time, Cuchulain Once we dwelled in
honour together, and still might dwell if I could find favour in thy
sight.&quot; &quot;By my word thou dost,&quot; said Cuchulain, &quot;and shalt
find it so long as I live.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Give me up,&quot; then said Fand. But
Emer said: &quot;Nay, it is more fitting that I be the deserted one. &quot;Not
so,&quot; said Fand; &quot;it is I who must go. &quot;And an eagerness for
lamentation seized upon Fand, and her soul was great within her, for it was
shame for her to be deserted and straightway to return to her home; moreover,
the mighty love that she bore to Cuchulain was tumultuous in her.&quot; [S A. H.
Leahy's translation, &quot; Heroic Romances of Ireland,&quot; vol.1.]</P>

<P>
But Mananan, the Son of the Sea, knew of her
sorrow and her shame, and he came to her aid, none seeing him but she alone, and
she welcomed him in a mystic song. &quot;Wilt thou return to me ?&quot; said
Mananan, &quot;or abide with Cuchulain ?&quot; &quot;In truth,&quot; said Fand,
&quot;neither of ye is better or nobler than the other, but I will go with thee,
Mananan, for thou hast no other mate worthy of thee, but that Cuchulain has in
Emer.&quot;</P>

<P>
So she went to Mananan, and Cuchulain, who
did not see the god, asked Laeg what was happening. &quot;Fand,&quot; he
replied, &quot; is going away with the Son of the Sea, since she hath not been
pleasing in thy sight.&quot;</P>

<P>
[227]</P>

<P>
Then Cuchulain bounded into the air and fled
from the place, and lay a long time refusing meat and drink, until at last the
Druids gave him a draught of forgetfulness; and Mananan, it is said, shook his
cloak between Cuchulain and Fand, so that they might meet no more throughout
eternity. [the cloak of Mananan (see p. 125) typifies the sea - here, in its
dividing and estranging power.]</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Vengeance of Maev</P>

</B>
<P>
Though Maev made peace with Ulster after the
battle of Garech she vowed the death of Cuchulain for all the shame and loss he
had brought upon her and on her province, and she sought how she might take her
vengeance upon him.</P>

<P>
Now the wife of the wizard Calatin, whom
Cuchulain slew at the Ford, brought forth, after her husband's death, six
children at a birth, namely, three sons and three daughters. Misshapen, hideous,
poisonous, born for evil were they; and Maev, hearing of these, sent them to
learn the arts of magic, not in Ireland only, but in Alba; and even as far as
Babylon they went to seek for hidden knowledge, and they came back mighty in
their craft, and she loosed them against Cuchulain.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Cuchulain and Blanid</P>

</B>
<P>
Besides the Clan Calatin, Cuchulain had also
other foes, namely Erc, the King of Ireland, son to Cairpre, whom Cuchulain had
slain in battle, and Lewy son of Curoi, King of Munster.[this Curoi appears in
various tales of the Ultonian Cycle with attributes which show that he was no
mortal king, but a local deity.] For Curoi's wife, Blanid, had set her love on
Cuchulain, and she bade him come and take her from Curoi's d&#363;n, and watch
his time to</P>

<P>
[228]</P>

<P>
attack the d&#363;n when he would see the
stream that flowed from it turn white. So Cuchulain and his men waited in a wood
hard by till Blanid judged that the time was fit, and she then poured into the
stream the milk of three cows. Then Cuchulain attacked the d&#363;n, and took it
by surprise, and slew Curoi, and bore away the woman. But Fercartna, the bard of
Curoi, went with them and showed no sign, till, finding him-self near Blanid as
she stood near the cliff-edge of Bear; he flung his arms round her, and leaped
with her over the cliff, and so they perished, and Curoi was avenged upon his
wife.</P>

<P>
All these now did Maev by secret messages and
by taunts and exhortations arouse against Cuchulain, and they waited till they
heard that the curse of Macha was again heavy on the men of UIster, and then
they assembled a host and marched to the Plain of Murthemney.</P>

<B>
<P>
<BR>

The Madness of Cuchulain</P>

</B>
<P>
And first the Children of Calatin caused a
horror and a despondency to fall upon the mind of Cuchulain, and out of the
hooded thistles and puff-balls and fluttering leaves of the forest they made the
semblance of armed battalions marching against Murthemney, and Cuchulain seemed
to see on every side the smoke of burning dwellings going up. And for two days
he did battle with the phantoms till he was sick and wearied out. Then Cathbad
and the men of Ulster persuaded him to retire to a solitary glen, where fifty of
the princesses of Ulster, and among them Niam, wife of his faithful friend
Conall of the Victories, tended him, and Niam made him vow that he would not
leave the d&#363;n where he was until she gave him leave.</P>

<P>
But still the Children of Calatin filled the
land with apparitions of war, and smoke and flames went up, and</P>

<P>
[229]</P>

<P>
wild cries and wailings with chattering,
goblin laughter and the braying of trumpets and horns were borne upon the winds.
And Bave, Calatin's daughter, went into the glen, and, taking the form of a
handmaid of Niam, she beckoned her away and led her to a distance among the
woods and put a spell of straying on her so that she was lost and could find her
way home no more. Bave then went in the form of Niam to Cuchulain and bade him
up and rescue Ulster from the hosts that were harrying it, and the Morrigan came
in the form of a great crow where Cuchulain sat with the women, and croaked of
war and slaughter. Then Cuchulain sprang up and called Laeg to harness his
chariot. But when Laeg sought for the Grey of Macha to harness him, the horse
fled from him, and resisted, and only with great difficulty could Laeg yoke him
in the chariot, while large tears of dark blood trickled down his face.</P>

<P>
Then Cuchulain, having armed himself, drove
forth; and on every side shapes and sounds of dread assailed him and clouded his
mind, and then it appeared to him that he saw a great smoke, lit with bursts of
red flame, over the ramparts of Emain Macha, and he thought he saw the corpse of
Emer tossed out over the ramparts. But when he came to his d&#363;n at
Murthemney, there was Emer living, and she entreated him to leave the phantoms
alone, but he would not listen to her, and he bade her farewell. Then he bade
farewell to his mother Dectera, and she gave him a goblet of wine to drink, but
ere he could drink it the wine turned to blood, and he flung it away, saying,
&quot;My life's end is near; this time I shall not return alive from the
battle.&quot; And Dectera and Cathbad besought him to await the coming of Conall
of the Victories, who was away on a journey, but he would not.</P>

The Washer at the Ford</P>

</B>
<P>
When he came to the ford upon the plain of
Emania he saw there kneeling by the stream as it were a young maiden, weeping
and wailing, and she washed a heap of bloody raiment and warlike arms in the
stream, and when she raised a dripping vest or corselet from the water Cuchulain
saw that they were his own. And as they crossed the ford she vanished from their
sight. [this apparition of the Washer of the Ford is of frequent occurrence In
Irish legend.]</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;<B>Clan
Calatin Again</P>

</B>
<P>
Then, having taken his leave of Conor and of
the womenfolk in Emania, he turned again towards Murthemney and the foe. But on
his way he saw by the roadside three old crones, each blind of one eye, hideous
and wretched, and they had made a little fire of sticks, and over it they were
roasting a dead dog on spits of rowan wood. As Cuchulain passed they called to
him to alight and stay with them and share their food. &quot;That will I not, in
sooth,&quot; said he. &quot;Had we a great feast,&quot; they said, &quot;thou
wouldst soon have stayed; it doth not become the great to despise the
small.&quot; Then Cuchulain, because he would not be thought discourteous to the
wretched, lighted down, and he took a piece of the roast and ate it, and the
hand with which he took it was stricken up to the shoulder so that its former
strength was gone. For it was <I>geis</I> to Cuchulain to approach a cooking
hearth and take food from it, and it was <I>geis </I>to him to eat of his
namesake. [see p. 164 for the reference to <I>geis</I>. &quot; His namesake '
refers, of course, to the story of the Hound of Cullan, pp. 183, 184.]</P>

<P>
[231]</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Death of Cuchulain</P>

</B>
<P>
Near to Slieve Fuad, south of Armagh,
Cuchulain found the host of his enemies, and drove furiously against them,
plying the champion's &quot;thunder-feat&quot; upon them until the plain was
strewn with their dead. Then a satirist, urged on by Lewy, came near him and
demanded his spear. [It was a point of honour to refuse nothing to a bard; one
king is said to have given his eye when it was demanded of him.] &quot;Have it'
then,&quot; said Cuchulain, and flung it at him with such force that it went
clean through him and killed nine men beyond. &quot;A king will fall by that
spear,&quot; said the Children of Calatin to Lewy, and Lewy seized it and flung
it at Cuchulain, but it smote Laeg, the king of charioteers, so that his bowels
fell out on the cushions of the chariot, and he bade farewell to his master and
he died.</P>

<P>
Then another satirist demanded the spear, and
Cuchulain said: &quot;I am not bound to grant more than one request on one
day.&quot; But the satirist said &quot;Then I will revile Ulster for thy
default,&quot; and Cuchulain flung him the spear as before, and Erc now got it,
and this time in flying back it struck the Grey of Macha with a mortal wound.
Cuchulain drew out the spear from the horse's side, and they bade each other
farewell, and the Grey galloped away with half the yoke hanging to its neck.</P>

<P>
And a third time Cuchulain flung the spear to
a satirist, and Lewy took it again and flung it back, and it struck Cuchulain,
and his bowels fell out in the chariot, and the remaining horse, Black
Sainglend, broke away and left him.</P>

<P>
&quot;I would fain go as far as to that
loch-side to drink,&quot; said Cuchulain, knowing the end was come, and they
suffered him to go when he had promised to return to them again. So he gathered
up his bowels into his</P>

<P>
[252]</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
breast and went to the loch-side, and drank,
and bathed himself, and came forth again to die. Now there was close by a tall
pillar-stone that stood westwards of the loch, and he went up to it and slung
his girdle over it and round his breast, so that he might die in his standing
and not in his lying down; and his blood ran down in a little stream into the
loch, and an otter came out of the loch and lapped it. And the host gathered
round, but feared to approach him while the life was still in him, and the
hero-light shone above his brow. Then came the Grey of Macha to protect him,
scattering his foes with biting and kicking.</P>

<P>
And then came a crow and settled on his
shoulder.</P>

<P>
Lewy, when he saw this, drew near and pulled
the hair of Cuchulain to one side over his shoulder, and with his sword he smote
off his head ; and the sword fell from Cuchulain's hand, and smote off the hand
of Lewy as it fell. They took the hand of Cuchulain in revenge for this, and
bore the head and hand south to Tara, and there buried them, and over them they
raised a mound. But Conall of the Victories, hastening to Cuchulain's side on
the news of the war, met the Grey of Macha streaming with blood, and together
they went to the loch-side and saw him headless and bound to the pillar-stone,
and the horse came and laid its head on his breast. Conall drove southwards to
avenge Cuchulain, and he came on Lewy by the river Liffey, and because Lewy had
but one hand Conall tied one of his behind his back, and for half the day they
fought, but neither could prevail. Then came Conall's horse, the Dewy-Red, and
tore a piece out of Lewy's side, and Conall slew him, and took his head, and
returned to Emain Macha. But they made no show of triumph in entering the city,
for Cuchulain the Hound of Ulster was no more.</P>

<P>
The Recovery of the Tain</P>

</B>
<P>
The history of the &quot;Tain,&quot; or
Cattle Raid, of Quelgny was traditionally supposed to have been written by no
other than Fergus mac Roy, but for a long time the great lay or saga was lost.
It was believed to have been written out in Ogham characters on staves of wood,
which a bard who possessed them had taken with him into Italy, whence they never
returned.</P>

<P>
The recovery of the &quot;Tain&quot; was the
subject of a number of legends which Sir S. Ferguson, in his &quot;Lays of the
Western Gael,&quot; has combined in a poem of so much power, <I>so </I>much
insight into the spirit of Gaelic myth, that I venture to reproduce much of it
here in telling this singular and beautiful story. It is said that after the
loss of the loss of the &quot;Tain&quot; Sanchan Torpest, chief bard of Ireland,
was once taunted at a feast by the High King Guary on his inability to recite
the most famous and splendid of Gaelic poems. This touched the bard to the
quick, and he resolved to recover the lost treasure. Far and wide through Erin
and through Alba he searched for<I> </I>traces of the lay, but could only
recover scattered fragments. He would have conjured up by magic arts the spirit
of Fergus to teach it to him, even at the cost of his own life - for such, it
seems, would have been the price demanded for the intervention and help of the
dead - but the place of Fergus's grave, where the spells must be said, could not
be discovered. At last Sanchan sent his son Murgen with his younger brother
Eimena to journey to Italy and endeavour to discover there the fate of the
staff-book. The brothers set off on their journey.</P>

<P>
&quot;Eastward, breadthwise over Erin
straightway travell'd forth the twain,<BR>

Till with many days' wayfaring Murgen fainted by Loch Ein :</P>

<P>
[234]</P>

<P>
'Dear my brother, thou art weary : I for
present aid am flown :<BR>

Thou for my returning tarry here beside this Standing Stone.'</P>

<P>
&quot;Shone the sunset red and solemn:
Murgen, where he leant, observed<BR>

Down the corners of the column letter-strokes of Ogham carved.<BR>

' 'Tis, belike, a burial pillar,' said he, ' and these shallow lines<BR>

Hold some warrior's name of valour, could I rightly spell the signs.'</P>

<P>
&quot;Letter then by letter tracing, soft he
breathed the sound of each<BR>

Sound and sound then interlacing, lo, the signs took form of speech;<BR>

And with joy and wonder mainly thrilling, part a-thrill with fear,<BR>

Murgen read the legend plainly, 'FERGUS SON OF ROY IS HERE.' &quot;</P>

<P>
Murgen then, though he knew the penalty,
appealed to Fergus to pity a son's distress, and vowed, for the sake of the
recovery of the &quot;Tain,&quot; to give his life, and abandon his kin and
friends and the maiden he loves, so that his father might no more be shamed. But
Fergus gave no sign, and Murgen tried another plea:</P>

<P>
&quot;Still he stirs not. Love of women thou
regard'st not, Fergus, now :<BR>

Love of children, instincts human, care for these no more hast thou :<BR>

Wider comprehension, deeper insights to the dead belong :-<BR>

Since for Love thou wak'st not, Sleeper, yet awake for sake of Song.</P>

<P>
&quot; 'Thou, the first in rhythmic cadence
dressing life's discordant tale,<BR>

Wars of chiefs and loves of maidens, gavest the Poem to the Gael;<BR>

Now they've lost their noblest measure, and in dark days hard at hand,<BR>

Song shall be the only treasure left them in their native land.'</P>

<P>
&quot;Fergus rose. A mist ascended with him,
and a flash was seen<BR>

As of brazen sandals blended with a mantle's wafture green;<BR>

But so thick the cloud closed o'er him Eimena, return'd at last,<BR>

Found not on the field before him but a mist-heap grey and vast.</P>

<P>
&quot;Thrice to pierce the hoar recesses
faithful Eimena essay'd;<BR>

Thrice through foggy wildernesses back to open air he stray'd;<BR>

Till a deep voice through the vapours fill'd the twilight far and near<BR>

And the Night her starry tapers kindling, stoop'd from heaven to hear.</P>

<P>
[235]</P>

<P>
&quot;Seem'd as though the skiey Shepherd
back to earth had cast the fleece<BR>

Envying gods of old caught upward from the darkening shrines of Greece;<BR>

So the white mists curl'd and glisten'd, so from heaven's expanses bare,<BR>

Stars enlarging lean'd and listen'd down the emptied depths of air.</P>

<P>
&quot;All night long by mists surrounded
Murgen lay in vapoury bars;<BR>

All night long the deep yoice sounded 'neath the keen, enlarging stars :<BR>

But when, on the orient verges, stars grew dim and mists retired,<BR>

Rising by the stone of Fergus, Murgen stood a man inspired.</P>

<P>
Back to Sanchan ! -Father, hasten, ere the
hour of power be past,<BR>

Ask not how obtain'd but listen to the lost lay found at last !'<BR>

Yea, these words have tramp of heroes in them; and the marching rhyme<BR>

Rolls the voices of the eras down the echoing steeps of Time.'</P>

<P>
&quot;Not till all was thrice related, thrice
recital full essay'd,<BR>

Sad and shamefaced, worn and faded, Murgen sought the faithful maid.<BR>

'Ah, so haggard; ah, so altered; thou in life and love so strong !'<BR>

'Dearly purchased,' Murgen falter'd, 'life and love I've sold for song !'</P>

<P>
&quot;'Woe is me, the losing bargain ! what
can song the dead avail ?'<BR>

'Fame immortal,' murmur'd Murgen, 'long as lay delights the Gael.'<BR>

'Fame, alas ! the price thou chargest not repays one virgin tear.'<BR>

'Yet the proud revenge I've purchased for my sire, I deem not dear.'</P>

<P>
&quot;So, again to Gort the splendid, when
the drinking boards were spread,<BR>

Sanchan, as of old attended, came and sat at table-head.<BR>

'Bear the cup to Sanchan Torpost : twin gold goblets, Bard, are thine,<BR>

If with voice and string thou harpest, <I>Tain--Bo-Cuailgine, </I>line for
line.'</P>

<P>
&quot; 'Yea, with voice and string I'll chant
it.' Murgen to his father's knee<BR>

Set the harp: no prelude wanted, Sanchan struck the master key,<BR>

And, as bursts the brimful river all at once from caves of Cong,<BR>

Forth at once, and once for ever, leap'd the torrent of the song.</P>

&quot;Floating on a brimful torrent, men go
down and banks go by :<BR>

Caught adown the lyric current, Guary, captured, ear and eye,<BR>

Heard no more the courtiers jeering, saw no more the walls of Gort,<BR>

Creeve Roe's [<I>Craobh Ruadh </I>-the Red Branch hostel] a meads instead
appearing, and Emania's royal fort.</P>

<P>
&quot;Vision chasing splendid vision, Sanchan
roll'd the rhythmic scene ;<BR>

They that mock'd in lewd derision now, at gaze, with wondering mien<BR>

Sate, and, as the glorying master sway'd the tightening reins of song,<BR>

Felt emotion's pulses faster - fancies faster bound along.</P>

<P>
&quot;Pity dawn'd on savage faces, when for
love of captive Crunn,<BR>

Macha, in the ransom-races, girt her gravid loins, to run<BR>

'Gainst the fleet Ultonian horses; and, when Deirdra on the road<BR>

Headlong dash'd her 'mid the corses, brimming eyelids overflow'd.</P>

<P>
&quot;Light of manhood's generous ardour,

When, mid-ford, on Uladh's border, young Cuchullin stood alone,<BR>

Maev and all her hosts withstanding :- ' Now, for love of knightly play,<BR>

Yield the youth his soul's demanding; let the hosts their marchings stay,</P>

<P>
&quot; 'Till the death he craves be given ;

'Twas the stroke of Conall's war-mace sounded through the startled room ;<BR>

And, while still the hall grew darker, king and courtier chill'd with dread,<BR>

Heard the rattling of the war-car of Cuchullin overhead.</P>

<P>
&quot;Half in wonder, half in terror, loth to
stay and loth to fly,<BR>

Seem'd to each beglamour'd hearer shade: of kings went thronging by :<BR>

But the troubled joy of wonder merged at last in mastering fear,<BR>

As they heard through pealing thunder, 'FERGUS SON OF ROY IS HERE !'</P>

<P>
&quot;Brazen-sandall'd, vapour-shrouded,
moving in an icy blast,<BR>

Through the doorway terror-crowded,up the tables Fergus pass'd :-<BR>

'Stay thy hand, oh harper, pardon ! cease the wild unearthly lay !<BR>

Murgen, bear thy sire his guerdon.' Murgen sat, a shape of clay.</P>

<P>
&quot;'Bear him on his bier beside me never

Shall a niggard king deride me: slaves, of Sanchan make their sport !<BR>

But because the maiden's yearnings needs must also be condoled,<BR>

Hers shall be the dear-bought earnings, hers the twin-bright cups of gold.'</P>

<P>
&quot; 'Cups,' she cried, 'of bitter

Let the joinings of the rhythm, let the links of sense and sound<BR>

<P>
&quot;So it comes, the lay, recover'd once at

Clings in coarser garb of fiction round the fragments that remain.&quot;</P>

<P>
The Phantom Chariot of Cuchulain</P>

</B>
<P>
Cuchulain, however, makes an impressive
reappearance in a much later legend of Christian origin, found in the
twelfth-century &quot;Book of the Dun Cow.&quot; He was summoned from Hell, we
are told, by St. Patrick to prove</P>

<P>
[238]</P>

<P>
the truths of Christianity and the horrors of
damnation to the pagan monarch, Laery mac Neill, King of Ireland. Laery, with
St. Benen, a companion of Patrick, are standing on the Plain of mac Indoc when a
blast of icy wind nearly takes them off their feet. It is the wind of Hell,
Benen explains, after its opening before Cuchulain. Then a dense mist covers the
plain, and anon a huge phantom chariot with galloping horses, a grey and a
black, loom up through the mist. Within it are the famous two, Cuchulain and his
charioteer, giant figures, armed with all the splendour of the Gaelic warrior.</P>

<P>
Cuchulain then talks to Laery, and urges him
to &quot;believe in God and in holy Patrick, for it is not a demon that has come
to thee, but Cuchulain son of Sualtam.&quot; To prove his identity he recounts
his famous deeds of arms, and ends by a piteous description of his present
state:</P>

<P>
&quot;What I suffered of trouble,<BR>

O Laery, by sea and land -<BR>

Yet more severe was a single night<BR>

When the demon was wrathful !<BR>

Great as was my heroism,<BR>

Hard as was my sword,<BR>

The devil crushed me with one finger<BR>

Into the red charcoal ! &quot;</P>

<P>
He ends by beseeching Patrick that heaven may
be granted to him, and the legend tells that the prayer was granted and that
Laery believed.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Death of Conor mac Nessa</P>

</B>
<P>
Christian ideas have also gathered round the
end of Cuchulain's lord, King Conor of Ulster. The manner of his death was as
follows: An unjust and cruel attack had been made by him on Mesgedra, King of
Leinster,</P>

<P>
[239]</P>

<P>
in which that monarch met his death at the
hand of Conall of the Victories. [the story is told in full in the author's
&quot; High Deeds of Finn.&quot;] Conall took out the brains of the dead king
and mingled them with lime to make a<I> </I>sling-stone-such &quot;brain
balls,&quot; as they were called, being accounted the most deadly of missiles.
This ball was laid up in the king's treasure-house at Emain Macha, where the
Connacht champion, Ket son of Maga, found it one day when prowling in disguise
through Ulster. Ket took it away and kept it always by him. Not long thereafter
the Connacht men took a spoil of cattle from Ulster, and the Ulster men) under
Conor, overtook them at a river-ford still called Athnurchar (The Ford of the
Sling-cast), in Westmeath. A battle was imminent, and many of the ladies of
Connacht came to their side of the river to view the famous Ultonian warriors,
and especially Conor, the stateliest man of his time. Conor was willing to show
himself, and seeing none hut women on the other bank he drew near them; but Ket,
who was lurking in ambush, now rose and slung the brain-ball at Conor, striking
him full in the forehead. Conor fell, and was carried off by his routed
followers. When they got him home, still living, to Emain Macha, his physician,
Fingen, pronounced that if the ball were extracted from his head he must die; it
was accordingly sewn up with golden thread, and the king was bidden to keep
himself from horse-riding and from all vehement passion and exertion, and he
would do well.</P>

<P>
Seven years afterwards Conor saw the sun
darken at noonday, and he summoned his Druid to tell him the cause of the
portent. The Druid, in a magic trance, tells him of a hill in a distant land on
which stand three crosses with a human form nailed to each of them, and one of
them is like the Immortals. &quot;Is he a</P>

<P>
[240]</P>

<P>
malefactor ?&quot; then asks Conor. &quot;
Nay,&quot; says the Druid, but the Son of the living God,&quot; and he relates
to the king the story of the death of Christ. Conor breaks out in fury, and
drawing his sword he hacks at the oak-trees in the sacred grove, crying,
&quot;Thus would I deal with his enemies,&quot; when with the excitement and
exertion the brain-ball bursts from his head, and he falls dead. And thus was
the vengeance of Mesgedra fulfilled. With Conor and with Cuchulain the glory of
the Red Branch and the dominance of Ulster passed away. The next, or Ossianic,
cycle of Irish legend brings upon the scene different characters, different
physical surroundings, and altogether different ideals of life.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Ket and the Boar of mac Datho</P>

</B>
<P>
The Connacht champion Ket, whose main exploit
was the wounding of King Conor at Ardnurchar, figures also in a very dramatic
tale entitled &quot;The Carving of mac Datho's Boar.&quot; The story runs as
follows :</P>

<P>
Once upon a time there dwelt in the province
of Leinster a wealthy hospitable lord named Mesroda, son of Datho. Two
possessions had he ; namely, a hound which could outrun every other hound and
every wild beast in Erin, and a boar which was the finest and greatest in size
that man had ever beheld.</P>

<P>
Now the fame of this hound was noised all
about the land, and many were the princes and lords who longed to possess it.
And it came to pass that Conor King of Ulster and Maev Queen of Connacht sent
messengers to mac Datho to ask him to sell them the hound for a price, and both
the messengers arrived at the dun of mac Datho on the same day. Said the
Connacht messenger:</P>

<P>
&quot;We will give thee in exchange for the
hound six hundred milch cows, and a chariot with two horses, the best that are
to be found in Connacht, and at the end</P>

<P>
[241]</P>

<P>
of a year thou shalt have as much
again.&quot; And the messenger of King Conor said: &quot;We will give no less
than Connacht, and the friendship and alliance of Ulster, and that will be
better for thee than the friendship of Connacht.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then Mesroda mac Datho fell<I> </I>silent,
and for three days he would not eat or drink, nor could he sleep o' nights, but
tossed restlessly on his bed. His wife observed his condition, and said to him:
&quot;Thy fast hath been long, Mesroda, though good food is by thee in plenty;
and at night thou turnest thy face to the wall, and well I know thou dost not
sleep. What is the cause of thy trouble?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;There is a saying,&quot; replied Mac
Datho, &quot;'Trust not a thrall with money, nor a woman with a secret.' &quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;When should a man talk to a
woman,&quot; said his wife, &quot;but when something were amiss? What thy mind
cannot solve perchance another's may.&quot;</P>

<P>
Then mac Datho told his wife of the request
for his hound both from Ulster and from Connacht at one and the same time.
&quot;And whichever of them I deny,&quot; he said, &quot;they will harry my
cattle and slay my people.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Then hear my counsel,&quot; said the
woman. &quot;Give it<I> </I>to both of them, and bid them come and fetch it; and
if there be any harrying to be done, let them even harry each other; but in no
way mayest thou keep the hound.&quot;</P>

<P>
Mac Datho followed this wise counsel, and
bade both Ulster and Connacht to a great feast on the same day, saying to each
of them that they could have the hound.&quot;</P>

<P>
So on the appointed day Conor of Ulster, and
Maev, and their retinues of princes and mighty men assembled at the d&#363;n of
mac Datho. There they found a great feast set forth, and to provide the chief
dish mac Datho</P>

<P>
[242]</P>

<P>
had killed his famous boar, a beast of
enormous size. The question now arose as to who should have the honourable task
of carving it, and Bricriu of the Poisoned Tongue characteristically, for the
sake of the strife which he loved, suggested that the warriors of Ulster and
Connacht should compare their principal deeds of arms, and give the carving of
the boar to him who seemed to have done best in the border-fighting which was
always going on between the provinces. After much bandying of words and of
taunts Ket son of Maga arises and stands over the boar, knife in hand,
challenging each of the Ulster lords to match his deeds of valour. One after
another they arise, Cuscrid son of Conor, Keitchar, Moonremur, Laery the
Triumphant, and others - Cuchulain is not introduced in this story - and in each
case Ket has some biting tale to tell of an encounter in which he has come off
better than they, and one by one they sit down shamed and silenced. At last a
shout of welcome is heard at the door of the hall and the Ulster-men grow
jubilant: Conall of the Victories has appeared on the scene, He strides up to
the boar, and Ket and he greet each other with chivalrous courtesy:</P>

<P>
&quot;And now welcome to thee, O Conall, thou
of the iron heart and fiery blood; keen as the glitter of ice, ever-victorious
chieftain; hall, mighty son of Finnchoom !&quot; said Ket.</P>

<P>
And Conall said: &quot;Hall to thee, Ket,
flower of heroes, lord of chariots, a raging sea in battle ; a strong, majestic
bull; hail,son of Maga !&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;And now,&quot; went on Conall,
&quot;rise up from the boar and give me place.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Why so ?&quot; replied Ket.</P>

<P>
&quot;Dost thou seek a contest from me
?&quot; said Conall.</P>

<P>
&quot;Verily thou shalt have it. By the gods
of my nation I swear that since I first took weapons in my hand. I</P>

<P>
[243]</P>

<P>
have never passed one day that I did not slay
a Connacht man, nor one night that I did not make a foray on them, nor have I
ever slept but I had the head of a Connacht man under my knee.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;I confess,&quot; then said Ket,
&quot;that thou art a better man than I, and I yield thee the boar. But if
Anluan my brother were here, he would match thee deed for deed, and sorrow and
shame it is that he is not.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Anluan is here,&quot; shouted Conall,
and with that he drew from his girdle the head of Anluan and dashed it in the
face of Ket.</P>

<P>
Then all sprang to their feet and a wild
shouting and tumult arose, and the swords flew out of themselves, and battle
raged in the hall of mac Datho. Soon the hosts burst out through the doors of
the d&#363;n and smote and slew each other in the open field., until the
Connacht host were put to flight. The hound of mac Datho pursued the chariot of
King Ailell of Connacht till the charioteer smote off its head, and so the cause
of contention was won by neither party, and mac Datho lost his hound, but saved
his lands and life.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Death of Ket</P>

</B>
<P>
The death of Ket is told in Keating's
&quot;History of Ireland.&quot; Returning from a foray in Ulster, he was
over-taken by Connall at the place called the Ford of Ket, and they fought long
and desperately. At last Ket was slain, but Conall of the Victories was in
little better case, and lay bleeding to death when another Connacht champion
named Bealcu [pronounced &quot;Bay-al-koo&quot;] found him. &quot;Kill me,&quot;
said Conall to him, &quot;that it be not said I fell at the hand of <I>one </I>Connacht
man.&quot; But Bealcu said : &quot;I will not slay a man at the point of death,
but I will bring thee home and heal thee, and when thy strength is come again</P>

<P>
[244]</P>

<P>
thou shalt fight with me in single
combat.&quot; Then Beilcu put Conall on a litter and brought him home, and had
him tended till his wounds were healed.</P>

<P>
The three sons of Bealcu, however, when they
saw what the Ulster champion was like in all his might, resolved to assassinate
him before the combat should take place. By a stratagem Conall contrived that
they slew their own father instead; and then, taking the heads of the three
sons, he went back, victoriously as he was wont, to Ulster.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Death of Maev</P>

</B>
<P>
The tale of the death of Queen Maev is also
preserved by Keating. Fergus mac Roy having been slain by Ailell with a cast of
a spear as he bathed in a lake with Maev, and Ailell having been slain by
Conall, Macv retired to an island [Inis Clothrann, now known as Quaker's Island.
The pool no longer exists.] on Loch Ryve, where she was wont to bathe early
every morning in a pool near to the landing place. Forbay son of Conor mac
Nessa, having discovered this habit of the queen's, found means one day to go
unperceived to the pool and to measure the distance from it to the shore of the
mainland. Then he went back to Emania,where he measured out the distance thus
obtained, and placing an apple on a pole at one end he shot at it continually
with a sling until he grew so good <I>a </I>marksman at that distance that he
never missed his aim. Then one day, watching his opportunity by the shores of
Loch Ryve, he saw Maev enter the water, and putting a bullet in his sling he
shot at her with so good an aim that he smote her in the centre of the forehead
and she fell dead.</P>

<P>
The great warrior queen had reigned in
Connacht, it was said, for eighty-eight years. She is a signal example</P>

<P>
[245]</P>

<P>
of the kind of women whom the Gaelic bards
delighted to portray. Gentleness and modesty were by no means their usual
characteristics, but rather a fierce overflowing life. Women-warriors like
Skatha and Aifa are frequently met with, and one is reminded of the Gaulish
women, with their mighty snow-white arms, so dangerous to provoke, of whom
classical writers tell us. The Gaelic bards, who in so many ways anticipated the
ideas of chivalric romance, did not do so in setting women in a place apart from
men. Women were judged and treated like men, neither as drudges nor as
goddesses, and we know that well into historic times they went with men into
battle, a practice only ended in the sixth century.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Fergus mac Leda and the Wee Folk</P>

</B>
<P>
Of the stories of the Ultonian Cycle which do
not centre on the figure of Cuchulain, one of the most interesting is that of
Fergus mac Leda and the King of the Wee Folk. In this tale Fergus appears as
King of Ulster, but as he was contemporary with Conor mac Nessa, and in the
Cattle Raid of Quelgny is represented as following him to war, we must conclude
that he was really a sub-king, like Cuchulain or Owen of Ferney.</P>

<P>
The tale opens in Faylinn, or the Land of the
Wee Folk, a race of elves presenting an amusing parody of human institutions on
a reduced scale, but endowed (like dwarfish people generally in the literature
of primitive races) with magical powers. Lubdan, [&quot;Youb&#180;dan&quot;] the
King of Faylinn, when flushed with wine at a feast, is bragging of the greatness
of his power and the invincibility of his armed forces - have they not the
strong man Glower, who with his axe has been known to hew down a thistle at a
stroke ? But the king's bard,</P>

<P>
[246]</P>

<P>
Eisirt<I>, has </I>heard something of a giant
race oversea in a land called Ulster, one man of whom would annihilate a whole
battalion of the Wee Folk, and he incautiously allows himself to hint as much to
the boastful monarch. He is immediately clapped into prison for his audacity,
and only gets free by promising to go immediately to the land of the mighty men,
and bring back evidence of the truth of his incredible story.</P>

<P>
So off he goes ; and one fine day King Fergus
and his lords find at the gate of their D&#363;n a tiny little fellow
magnificently dad in the robes of a royal bard, who demands entrance. He is
borne in upon the hand of AEda, the king's dwarf and bard, and after charming
the court by his wise and witty sayings, and receiving a noble largesse, which
he at once distributes among the poets and other court attendants of Ulster, he
goes off home, taking with him as a guest the dwarf AEda, before whom the Wee
Folk fly as a &quot;Fomorian giant,&quot; although, as Eisirt explains, the
average man of Ulster can carry him like a child. lubdan is now convinced, but
Eisirt puts him under <I>geise, </I>the bond of chivalry which no Irish
chieftain can repudiate without being shamed, to go himself, as Eisirt has done,
to the palace of Fergus and taste the king's porridge. lubdan, after he has seen
AEda, is much dismayed, but he prepares to go, and bids Bebo, his wife,
accompany him. &quot;You did an ill deed,&quot; she says, &quot;when you
condemned Eisirt to prison; but surely there is no man under the sun that can
make thee hear reason.&quot;</P>

<P>
So off they go, and lubdan's fairy steed
bears them over the sea till they reach Ulster, and by midnight they stand
before the king's palace. &quot;Let us taste the porridge as we were
bound,&quot; says Bebo, &quot;and make off before daybreay&quot; They steal in
and find the</P>

<P>
[247]</P>

<P>
porridge-pot, to the rim of which lubdan can
only reach by standing. on his horse's back. In straining downwards to get at
the porridge he overbalances himself and falls in. There in the thick porridge
he sticks fast, and there Fergus's scullions find him at the break of day, with
the faithful Bebo lamenting. They bear him off to Fergus, who is amazed at
finding another wee man, with a woman too, in his palace. He treats them
hospitably, but refuses all appeals to let them go. The story now recounts in a
spirit of broad humour several Rabelaisian adventures in which Bebo is
concerned, and gives a charming poem supposed to have been uttered by lubdan in
the form of advice to Fergus's fire-gillie as to the merits for burning of
different kinds of timber. The following arc extracts:</P>

<P>
&quot;Burn not the sweet apple-tree of
drooping branches, of the white blossoms, to whose gracious head each man puts
forth his hand.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Burn not the noble willow, the
unfailing ornament of poems; bees drink from its blossoms, all delight in the
graceful tent.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;The delicate, airy tree of the Druids,
the rowan with its berries, this burn ; but avoid the weak tree, burn not the
slender hazel.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;The ash-tree of the black buds burn
not-timber that speeds the wheel, that yields the rider his switch the ashen
spear is the scale-beam of battle.&quot;</P>

<P>
At last the Wee Folk come in a great
multitude to beg the release of lubdan. On the king's refusal they visit the
country with various plagues, snipping off the ears of corn, letting the calves
suck all the cows dry, defiling the wells, and so forth ; but Fergus is
obdurate. In their quality as earth-gods, <I>dei terreni, </I>they promise to
make the plains before the palace of Fergus stand thick with corn every year
without ploughing or sowing,</P>

<P>
[248]</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P ALIGN="center">
</P>

<P>
but all is vain. At last, however, Fergus
agrees to ransom lubdan against the best of his fairy treasures, so lubdan
recounts them-the cauldron that can never be emptied, the harp that plays of
itself; and finally he mentions a pair of water-shoes, wearing which a man can
go over or under water as freely as on dry land. Fergus accepts the shoes, and
lubdan is released.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
The Blemish of Fergus</P>

</B>
<P>
But it is hard for a mortal to get the better
of Fairy-land-a touch of hidden malice lurks in magical gifts, and so it proved
now. Fergus was never tired of exploring the depths of the lakes and rivers of
Ireland; but one day, in Loch Rury, he met with a hideous monster, the <I>Muirdris,
</I>or river-horse, which inhabited that lake, and from which he barely saved
himself by flying to the shore. With the terror of this encounter his face was
twisted awry; but since a blemished man could not hold rule in Ireland, his
queen and nobles took pains, on some pretext, to banish all mirrors from the
palace, and kept the knowledge of his condition from him. One day, however, he
smote a bondmaid with a switch, for some negligence, and the maid, indignant,
cried out : &quot;lt were better for thee, Fergus, to avenge thyself on the
river-horse that hath twisted thy face than to do brave deeds on women !&quot;
Fergus bade fetch him a mirror, and looked in it. &quot; It is true,&quot; he
said; &quot;the river-horse of Loch Rury has done this thing.&quot;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<B>
<P>
Death of Fergus</P>

</B>
<P>
The conclusion may be given in the words of
Sir Samuel Ferguson's fine poem on this theme. Fergus</P>

<P>
[249]</P>

<P>
donned the magic shoes, took sword in hand,
and went to Loch Rury :</P>

<P>
&quot;For a day and night<BR>

Beneath the waves he rested out of sight,<BR>

But all the Ultonians on the bank who stood<BR>

Saw the loch boil and redden with his blood.<BR>

When next at sunrise skies grew also red<BR>

He rose - and in his hand the <I>Muirdris' </I>head.<BR>

Gone was the blemish ! On his goodly face<BR>

Each trait symmetric had resumed its place :<BR>

And they who saw him marked in all his mien<BR>

A king's composure, ample and serene.<BR>

He smiled; he cast his trophy to the bank,<BR>

Said, 'I, survivor, Ulstermen !' and sank.&quot;</P>

<P>
This fine tale has been published in full
from an Egerton MS., by Mr. Standish Hayes O'Grady, in his &quot;Silva
Gadelica.&quot; The humorous treatment of the fairy element in the story would
mark it as belonging to a late period of Irish legend, but the tragic and noble
conclusion unmistakably signs it <I>as </I>belonging to the Ulster bardic
literature, and it falls within the same order<I> </I>of ideas, if it were not
composed within the same period, as the tales of Cuchulain.</P>

<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;<B>Significance
of Irish Place-Names</P>

</B>
<P>
Before leaving this great cycle of legendary
literature let us notice what has already, perhaps, attracted the attention of
some readers - the extent to which its chief characters and episodes have been
commemorated in the still surviving place-names of the country. [Dr. P. W.
Joyce's &quot;Irish Names of Places&quot; is a storehouse of information on this
subject.] This is true of Irish legend in general - it is especially so of the
Ultonian Cycle. Faithfully indeed, through many a century of darkness and
forgetting, have these names pointed to the hidden treasures of heroic romance</P>

<P>
[250]</P>

<P>
which the labours of our own day are now
restoring to light. The name of the little town of Ardee, as we have seen,
[p.211, <I>note</I>] commemorates the tragic death of Ferdia at the hand of his
&quot;heart companion,&quot; the noblest hero of the Gad. The ruins of D&#363;n
Baruch, where Fergus was bidden to the treacherous feast, still look over the
waters of Moyle, across which Naisi and Deirdre sailed to their doom.
Ardnurchar, the Hill of the Sling-cast, in Westmeath, [the name is given to the
hill, <I>ard</I>, and to the ford, <I>atha</I> beneath it.] brings to mind the
story of the stately monarch, the crowd of gazing women, and the crouching enemy
with the deadly missile which bore the vengeance of Mesgedra. The name of
Armagh, or Ard Macha, the Hill of Macha, enshrines the memory of the Fairy Bride
and her heroic sacrifice, while the grassy rampart can still be traced where the
war-goddess in the earlier legend drew its outline with the pin of her brooch
when she founded the royal fortress of Ulster. Many pages might be filled with
these instances. Perhaps no modern country has place-names so charged with
legendary associations as are those of Ireland. Poetry and myth are there still
closely wedded to the very soil of the land-a fact in which there lies ready to
hand an agency for education, for inspiration, of the noblest kind, if we only
had the insight to see it and the art to make use of it.</P>
