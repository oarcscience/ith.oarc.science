<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE TILE-STOVE JUMPING OVER THE BROOK</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>NEAR Hellested in Zealand, lived a man, who from time to time remarked that he was continually plundered. All his suspicions fell on the Troll-folk, who lived in the neighbouring hill of lldsh&ouml;i <I>(Fire-hill), </I>and once hid himself to try and get a sight of the thief. He had waited there but a very short time when he saw, as he thought, his tile-stove jumping across the brook. The good farmer was all astonishment at this strange sight, and he shouted out "Hurra! there 'a a jump for a tile-stove!" At this exclamation the Troll, who was wading through the water with the stove on his head, was so frightened that he threw it down, and ran off as hard as he could to lldsh&ouml;i. But in the place where the stove fell, the ground got the shape of it, and the place is called Krogbek <I>(Hook-brook), </I>and it was this that gave rise to the common saying, "That was a jump for a tile-stove!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
