THE YOUNG PIPER

>  

> THERE was livin', it's not very long ago, on the borders o' the county
> Wicklow, a dacint honest couple, whose names wor Mick Flanagan and
> Judy Muldoon. These poor people wor blist, as the saying is, wid four
> childher, all buys: three o' them wor as fine, stout, healthy,
> goodlukin' childher as ivir the sun shone upon; an' it was enough to
> make any Irishman proud of the breed of his counthrymen to see thim
> about one o'clock on a find summer's day stannin' at their father's
> cabin-door, wid their beautiful, fine flaxen hair hangin' in curls
> about their heads, an' their cheeks like two rosy apples, an' a big,
> laughin' potato, smokin' in their hand. A proud man was Mick, o' these
> fine childher, an' a proud woman, too, was Judy; an' raison enough
> they had to be so. But it was far otherwise wid the remainin' one,
> which was the ouldest; he was the most miserable, ugly,
> ill-conditioned brat that ivir God put life into: he was so ill
> thriven, that he was nivir able to stand alone or to lave his cradle;
> he had long, shaggy, matted, curly hair, as black as the sut; his face
> was uv a greenish yollow colour; his eyes wor like two burnin' coals,
> an' wor for ever movin' in his head, as if they had the parpaitual
> motion. Before he was a twel'month ould he had a mouth full o' great
> teeth; his hands wor like kite's claws, and his legs wor no thicker
> nor the handle of a whip, and about as straight as a rapin' hook; to
> make the matther worse, he had the gut uv a cormorant, and the whinge,
> and the yelp, and the screech, and the yowl, was never out of his
> mouth.

> The neighbours all suspicted that he was somethin' not right, more
> especialy as it was obsarved, that whin people, as they use to do in
> the counthry, got about the fire, and begun to talk o' religion and
> good things, the brat, as he lay in the cradle which his mother
> ginerally put near the fireplace that he might be snug, used to sit
> up, as they wor in the middle of their talk, and begin to bellow as if
> the devil was in him in right airnest: this, as I said, led the
> neighbours to think that all wasn't right wid him, an' there was a
> gineral consultashion held one day, about what id be best to do wid
> him. Some advised to put him out an the shovel, but Judy's pride was
> up at that. A purty thing, indeed, that a child of her's shud be put
> an a shovel, an' flung out on the dunghill jist like a dead kitten or
> a pisoned rat; no, no, she wouldn't hear to that at all. One ould
> woman, who was considhered mighty skilful an' knowin' intirely in
> fairy matthers sthrongly recomminded to put the tongs in the fire, an'
> to hate thim rid hot, an' thin to take his nose in thim, an' that that
> id, beyant all manner o' doubt, make him tell what he was, an' whare
> he come from (for the gineral supishion was, that he was changed by
> the good people); but Judy was too saft-harted, an' too fond o' the
> imp, so she wouldn't giv' into this plan neither, though iverybody
> said she was wrong; and may be so she was, but it's a hard thing, you
> know, to blame a mother. Well some advised one thing and some another,
> at last one spoke of sindin fur the priest, who was a very holy an' a
> very larned man, to see it; to this Judy uv coorse had no objection,
> but one thing or another always purvinted her doing so, an' the upshot
> o' the business was that the priest niver seen him at all. Well,
> things wint on in the ould way for some time longer. The brat
> continued yelpin' an' yowlin', an' aitin' more nor his three brothers
> put together, an' playin' all sorts uv unlucky thricks, for he was
> mighty mischievyously inclined, till it happened one day that Tim
> Carrol, the blind piper, goin' his rounds, called in and sot down by
> the fire to hav' a bit o' chat wid the woman o' the house. So afther
> some time, Tim, who was no churl uv his music, yoked an the pipes an'
> begun to bellows away in high style; whin the instant minnit he begun,
> the young fellow, who was lyin' as still as a mouse in his cradle, sot
> up, an begun to grin an' to twist his ugly phiz, an' to swing about
> his long tawny arms, an' to kick out his cracked legs, an' to show
> signs o' grate glee at the music. At last nothin' id sarve him but he
> must git the pipes into his own hands, an', to humour him, his mother
> axt Tim to lind thim to the child for a minnit. Tim, who was kind to
> childher, readily consinted; and, as Tim hadn't his sight, Judy
> herself brought thim to the cradle, an' wint to put thim an him, but
> she had no need, for the youth seemed quite up to the business. He
> buckled an the pipes, set the bellows undher one arm and the bag
> undher th' other, an' worked thim both as knowingly as iv he was
> twinty years at the thrade, an' lilted up "Sheela na Guira," in the
> finest style that iver was hard.

> Well, all was in amazemint; the poor woman crast herself: Tim, who, as
> I tould you afore, was dark an' didn't well know who was playin,' was
> in grate delight; an' whin he hard that it was a little *prechaun,*
> \[an abridgment of *Leprechaun*\] not aight years ould, that nivir
> seen a set of pipes in all his days afore, he wished the mother joy iv
> her son; offered to take him aff her han's iv she'd part wid him,
> swore he was a born piper, a nath'ral jainses, an' declared that in a
> little time more, wid the help uv a little good tachein' frum himsilf
> there wouldn't be his match in the whole counthry round. The poor
> woman was grately delighted to hear all this, particklarly as what Tim
> sed about nathral jainises put an ind to some misgivin's that war
> risin' in hur mind, laist what the naybours sed about his not bein'
> right might be only too thrue; an' it gratified hur too to think that
> her dear child (for she raely loved the whelp) wouldn't be forced to
> turn out an' big, but might airn dacent, honest bread fur himsilf. So
> whin Mick come home in the evenin' frum his work, she up an' she tould
> him all that happined, an' all that Tim Carrol sed; an Mick, as was
> nath'ral, was very glad to hear it, for the helpless condition o' the
> poor crather was a grate throuble to him; so nixt fair-day he tuk the
> pig to the fair of Naas, and wid what it brought he whipt up, the nixt
> holiday that come, to Dublin, an' bespoke a bran new set o' pipes o'
> the proper size fur him, an' the nixt time Tom Doolan whit up wid the
> cars, in about a fortnight after, the pipes come home, an' the minnit
> the chap in the cradle laid eyes on thim, he squealed wid delight, an'
> threw up his purty legs, an' bumped himsilf in his cradle, an' wint an
> wid a grate many comical thricks; till at last, to quite him, they gev
> him the pipes, an' immajetly he set to an' pulled away at "Jig
> Polthog," to th' admirashin uv all that hard him.

> Well, the fame uv his skill an the pipes soon spread far an' near, for
> there wasn't a piper in the nixt three counties cud come near him at
> all, in Ould Maudha Roo, or the Hare in the Corn, or The Fox Hunther's
> Jig, or The Piper's Maggot, or any uv the fine ould Irish jigs, that
> make people dance whether they will or no: an' it was surprisin' to
> hear him rattle away The Fox Hunt; you'd raaly think you hard the
> hounds givin' tongue, an' the terriers yelpin' always behind, an' the
> huntsman an' the whippers-in cheerin' or correctin' the dogs; it was,
> in short, the very nixt thing to seein' the hunt itself. The best uv
> him was, he was no way stingy uv his music, an' many's the merry dance
> the boys an' the girls o' the neighbourhood used to hav' in his
> father's cabin; an' he 'd play up music fur thim that, they sed, used,
> as it wor, to put quicksilver in their feet; an' they all declared
> they nivir moved so light an' so airy to any piper's playin' that ivir
> they danced to.

> But besides all his fine Irish music, he had one quare chune uv his
> own, the oddest that iver was hard; fur the minnit he begun to play it
> iverything in the house seemed disposed to dance; the plates an'
> porringers used to jingle an the dhresser, the pots an' pot-hooks used
> to rattle in the chimbley, an' people used even to fancy they felt the
> stools movin' frum undher thim; but, how--iver it might be wid the
> stools, it is sartin that no one cud keep long sittin' an them, fur
> both ould and young always fell to caperin' as hard as ivir they cud.
> The girls complained that whin he begun this chime it always threw
> thim out in their dancin', an' that they nivir cud handle their feet
> rightly, fur they felt the flure like ice undher thim, an' thimsilves
> ready iviry minnit to come sprawlin' an their backs or their faces;
> the young bachelors that wanted to show aff their dancin' an' their
> new pumps, an' their bright red or green an' yellow garthers, swore
> that it confused thim so that they cud nivir go rightly through the
> heel-and-toe, or cover-the-buckle, or any nv their best steps, but
> felt thimsilves always bedizzied an' bewildhered, an' thin ould an'
> young id go jostlin' an' knockin' together in a frightful manner an'
> whin the anlooky brat had thim all in this way whirligiggin' about the
> flure, he'd grin an' he 'd chuckle an' he 'd chather, jist fur all the
> world like Jocko, the monkey, whin he 'a played off sum uv his
> roguery.

> The oulder he grew the worse he grew, an' by the time he was noine
> year ould there was no stannin' the house for him; he was always
> makin' his brothers burn or scald thimsilves, or brake their shins
> ovir the pots an' stools. One time in harvist, he was left at home by
> himself; an' whin his mother come in she found the cat a horseback on
> the dog wid hur face to the tail, an' hur legs tied round him, an' the
> urchin playin' his quare chune to thim, so that the dog wint barking
> an jumpin' about, an' puss was miowin' fur the dear life, an' slappin'
> her tail backwards an' forwards, which whin it id hit agin the dog's
> chaps, he'd snap at it an' bite it, an' thin there was the philhiloo.
> Another time the farmer Mick worked wid, a mighty dacint kind uv a
> man, happened to call in, an' Judy wiped a stool wid her apron an'
> axed him to sit down an rest himself afther his walk. He was sittin'
> wid his back to the cradle, an' behind him was a pan o' blood, fur
> Judy was makin' hog's puddin's; the lad lay quite still in his nist,
> an' watched his opportunity till he got ready a hook at the hid uv a
> piece o' packthread an' he conthrived to fling it so handy that it
> cotcht in the bob o' the man's nice new wig, an' soused it in the pan
> o' blood. Another time his mother was comin' in from milkin' the cow,
> wid the pail an her head, an' the very minnit he saw her, he lilted up
> his infernal chune, an' the poor woman lettin' go the pail, clapped
> her hands aside an' begun to dance a jig, an' tumbled the milk all
> atop uv her husband, who was bringin' in some turf to bile the supper.
> In short there id be no ind to tellin' all his pranks, an' all the
> mischievyous tricks he played.

> Soon afther, some mischances begun to happen to the farmer's cattle; a
> horse tuk the staggers, a fine vale calf died o' the blacklig, an'
> some uv his sheep o' the rid wather; the cows begun to grow vicious,
> an' to kick down the milkpails, an' the roof o' one hid o' the barn
> fell in; an' the farmer tuk it into his head that Mick Flannagan's
> onlooky child was the cause uv all the mischief. So, one day, he
> called Mick aside, an' sed to him, "Mick," sez he, "you see things are
> not goin' on wid me as they ought to go; an' to be plain an' honest
> wid you, Mick, I think that child o' yours is the cause uv it. I am
> raaly fallin' away to nothin', wid frettin', an' I can hardly sleep an
> my bed at night for thinkin' o' what may happen afore the mornin'. So
> I 'd be glad af you'd luk out fur work somewhare else; you 're as good
> a man as any in the whole counthry, there 'a no denyin' it, an'
> there's no fear but you'll have yer choice o' work." To this Mick med
> answer, and sed, "that he was sorry indeed for his losses, and still
> sorrier that he or his shud be thought to be the cause o' thim; that,
> for his own part, he wasn't quite aisy in his mind about that child,
> but he had him, an' so he must keep him;" an' he promised to Iuk out
> fur another place immajetly.

> So nixt Sunday at chapil, Mick gev out that he was about lavin' the
> work at John Riordan's, an' immajetly a farmer, who lived a couple o'
> miles aff, an' who wanted a ploughman (the last one havin' jist left
> him), come up to Mick, an' offered him a house an' garden, an' work
> all the year round. Mick, who knew him to be a good employer,
> immajetly closed wid him. So it was agreed that the farmer shud sind
> his car to take his little bit o' furniture, an' that he shud remove
> an the following Thursday.

> Whin Thursday come, the car come accordin' to promise, an' Mick loaded
> it, an' put the cradle wid the child an' his pipes an the top, an'
> Judy sat beside it to take care uv him, laste he shud tumble out an'
> be kilt; they dray the cow afore thim, the dog folled; but the cat, uv
> course, was lift behind: an' the other three childer wint along the
> road, pickin' haves and blackberries; for it was a fine day towst the
> latther ind uv harvist. They had to crass a river; but as it run
> through the bottom between two high banks, you didn't see it till you
> wor close up an it. The young fellow was lyin' purty quite in the
> bottom *o'* the cradle, till they come to the head o' the bridge, whin
> hearin' the roarin' o' the wather (for there was a grate flood in the
> river, as there was heavy rain for the last two or three days), he sot
> up in his cradle, an' luked about him; an' the minnit he got a sight
> ov the wather, an' found they wor goin' to take him acrass it, oh! how
> he did bellow, an' how he did squeal. "Whisht, alanna," sed Judy,
> "there 'a no fear o' yer; shure it 'a only ovir the stone bridge we
> 're goin'." "Bad luck to yer, ye ould rip," sez he, "what a purty
> thrick yuv played me, to bring me here;" an' he still wint an yellin',
> and the farther they got an the bridge, the loudher he yelled; till at
> last Mick cud hould out no longer; so givin' him a skelp o' the whip
> he had in his han', "Divil choke you, you crukked brat," sez he; "will
> you nivir stop bawlin'? a body can't hear their ears for you." Well,
> my dear, the instant minnit he felt the thong o' the whip, he jumped
> up in the cradle, clapped the pipes undher his arm, an' lept dane ovir
> the battlemints o' the bridge down into the wather. "Oh, my child! my
> child!" shouted Judy; "he's dane gone for ivir frum me." Mick an' the
> rest o' the childher 'run to the other side o' the bridge an' lukt
> down, an' they seen him comin' out from undher the arch o' the bridge,
> sittin crass-liggs an the top uv a big white-headed wave, an' playin'
> away an the pipes, jist as if nothin' had happened at all. The river
> was runnin very hard, so he was whirled away at a grate rate; but he
> played away as fast, ay, and faster nor the river run. They set aff as
> hard as they cud along the bank; but as the river med a suddint turn
> round the hill, about a hundred yards below the bridge, by the time
> they got there he was out o' sight, an' no one ivir led eyes an him
> sence; but the gineral belief is, that he wint home wid the pipes to
> his own relations--the good people--to make music fur thim.
