RHYS AT THE FAIRY-DANCE

>  

> Rhys and Llewellyn, two farmer's servants, who bad been all day
> carrying lime for their master, were driving in the twilight their
> mountain ponies before them, returning home from their work. On
> reaching a little plain, Rhys called to his companion to stop and
> listen to the music, saying it was a tune to which he had danced a
> hundred times, and must go and have a dance now. He bade him go on
> with the horses, and he would soon overtake him. Llewellyn could hear
> nothing, and began to remonstrate; but away sprang Rhys, and he called
> after him in vain. He went home, put up the ponies, ate his supper,
> and went to bed, thinking that Rhys had only made a pretext for going
> to the ale-house. But when morning came, and still no sign of Rhys, he
> told his master what had occurred. Search was then made everywhere,
> but no Rhys could be found. Suspicion now fell upon Llewellyn of
> having murdered him, and he was thrown into prison, though there was
> no evidence against him. A farmer, however, skilled in fairy-matters,
> having an idea of how things might have been, proposed that himself
> and some others should accompany Llewellyn to the place where he
> parted with Rhys. On coming to it, they found it green as the mountain
> ash. "Hush!" cried Llewellyn, "I hear music, I hear sweet harps." We
> all listened, says the narrator, for I was one of them, but could hear
> nothing. "Put your foot on mine, David," said he to me (his own foot
> was at the time on the outward edge of the fairy-ring). I did so, and
> so did we all, one after another, and then we beard the sound of many
> harps, and saw within a circle, about twenty feet across, great
> numbers of little people, of the size of children of three or four
> years old, dancing round and round. Among them we saw Rhys, and
> Llewellyn catching him by the smock-frock, as he came by him, pulled
> him out of the circle. "Where are the horses? where are the horses?"
> cried he. "Horses, indeed!" said Llewellyn. Rhys urged him to go home,
> and let him finish his dance, in which he averred he had not been
> engaged more than five minutes. It was by main force they took him
> from the place. He still asserted he had been only five minutes away,
> and could give no account of the people he had been with. He became
> melancholy, took to his bed, and soon after died. "The morning after,"
> says the narrator, "we went to look at the place, and we found the
> edge of the ring quite red, as if trodden down, and I could see the
> marks of little heels, about the size of my thumb-nail."
