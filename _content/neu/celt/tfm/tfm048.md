THE NIS REMOVING \[a\]

 

> IT is very difficult, they say, to get rid of a Nis when one wishes
> it. A man who lived in a house in which a Nis carried his pranks to
> great lengths resolved to quit the tenement, and leave him there
> alone. Several cart-loads of furniture and other articles were already
> gone, and the man was come to take away the last, which consisted
> chiefly of empty tubs, barrels, and things of that sort. The load was
> now all ready, and the man had just bidden farewell to his house and
> to the Nis, hoping for comfort in his new habitation, when happening,
> from some cause or other, to go to the back of the cart, there he saw
> the Nia sitting in one of the tubs in the cart, plainly with the
> intention of going along with him wherever he went. The good man was
> surprised and disconcerted beyond measure at seeing that all his
> labour was to no purpose; but the Nis began to laugh heartily, popped
> his head up out of the tub, and cried to the bewildered farmer, "Ha!
> we 're moving to-day, you see. " \[b\]

> \[a\] The places mentioned in the following stories are all in
> Jutland. It is remarkable that we seem to have scarcely any Nis
> stories from Sweden.

> \[b\] This story is current in Germany, England, and Ireland. In the
> German story the farmer set fire to his barn to burn the Kobold in it.
> As he was driving oft', he tuned round to look at the blaze, and, to
> his no small mortification, saw the Kobold behind him in the cart,
> crying "It was time for us to come out--it was time for us to come
> out!"
