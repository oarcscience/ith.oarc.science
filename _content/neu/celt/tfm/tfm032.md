A FARMER TRICKS A TROLL

>  

> A FARMER, on whose ground there was a little hill, resolved not to let
> it lie idle, so he began at one end to plough it up. The hill-man, who
> lived in it, came to him and asked him bow he dared to plough on the
> roof of his house. The farmer assured him that he did not know that it
> was the roof of his house, but at the same time represented to him
> that it was at present equally unprofitable to them both to let such a
> piece of land lie idle. He therefore took the opportunity of proposing
> to him that he should plough, sow, and, reap it every year on these
> terms: that they should take it year and year about, and the hill-man
> to have one year what grew over the ground, and the farmer what grew
> in the ground; and the next year the farmer to have what was over, and
> the hill-man what was under.

> The agreement was made accordingly; but the crafty farmer took care to
> sow carrots and corn year and year about, and he gave the hill-man the
> tops of the carrots and the roots of the corn for his share, with
> which he was well content. They thus lived for a long time on
> extremely good terms with each other. \[a\]

> the farmers. The legends are surely independent fictions.
