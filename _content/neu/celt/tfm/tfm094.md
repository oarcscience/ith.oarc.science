THE WORKING WATERMAN

>  

> AT Seewenweiher, in the Black-Forest, a little Water-man
> *(Seemänlein)* used to come and join the people, work the whole day
> long with them, and in the evening go back into the lakes. They used
> to set his breakfast and dinner apart for him. When, in apportioning
> the work, the rule of "Not too much and not too little" was infringed,
> he got angry, and knocked all the things about. Though his clothes
> were old and worn, he steadily refused to let the people get him new
> ones. But when at last they would do so, and one evening the lake-man
> was presented with a new coat, be said, "When one is paid off, one
> must go away. After this day I'II come no more to you." And, unmoved
> by the excuses of the people, he never let himself be seen again.
