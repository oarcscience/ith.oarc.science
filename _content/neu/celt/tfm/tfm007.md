MIDDLE-AGE ROMANCE

> Yet still there is a high degree of probability in the supposition of
> the luxuriant fictions of the East having through Spain and Syria
> operated on European fancy. The poetry and romance of the middle ages
> are notoriously richer in detail, and more gorgeous in invention, than
> the more correct and chaste strains of Greece and Latium; the island
> of Calypso, for example, is in beauty and variety left far behind by

> The pomp of her heroic games,  
> And crested knights and tissued dames  
> Assembled at the clarion's call,  
> In some proud castle's high-arch'd hall,

> that a degree of pomp and splendour met the eye of the minstrel and
> romancer on which the bards of the simple republics of ancient times
> had never gazed, and this might account for the difference between the
> poetry of ancient and of middle-age Europe. Yet, notwithstanding, we
> discover such an Orientalism in the latter as would induce us to
> acquiesce in the hypothesis of the fictions and the manner of the East
> having been early transmitted to the West; and it is highly probable
> that along with more splendid habits of life entered a more lavish use
> of the gorgeous stores laid open to the plastic powers of fiction. The
> tales of Arabia were undoubtedly known in Europe from a very early
> period. The romance of Cleomades and Claremonde, which was written in
> the thirteenth century, \[a\] not merely resembles, but actually is
> the story of the Enchanted Horse in the Thousand and One Nights.
> Another tale in the same collection, The two Sisters who envied their
> younger Sister, may be found in Straparola, and is also a popular
> story in Germany; and in the Pentamerone and. other collections of
> tales published long before the appearance of M. Galland's translation
> of the Eastern ones, numerous traces of an oriental origin may be
> discerned. The principal routes they came by may also be easily shown.
> The necessities of commerce and the pilgrimage to Mecca occasioned a
> constant intercourse between the Moors of Spain and their
> fellow-sectaries of the East; and the Venetians, who were the owners
> of Candia, carried on an extensive trade with Syria and Egypt. it is
> worthy of notice, that the Notti Piacevoli of Straparola were first
> published in Venice, and that Basile, the author of the Pentamerone,
> spent his youth in Candia, and was afterwards a long time at Venice.
> Lastly, pilgrims were notorious narrators of marvels, and each, as he
> visited the Holy Land, was anxious to store his memory with those
> riches, the diffusal of which procured him attention and hospitality
> at home.

> We think, therefore, that European romance may be indebted, though not
> for the name, yet for some of the attributes and exploits of its
> fairies to Asia. This is more especially the case with the romances
> composed or turned into prose in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and
> sixteenth centuries; for in the earlier ones the Fairy Mythology is
> much more sparingly introduced.

> But beside the classic and oriental prototypes of its fairies, romance
> may have had an additional one in the original mythology of the Celtic
> tribes, of which a being very nearly allied to the fay of romance
> appears to have formed a part. Such were the damoiselles who bestowed
> their favours upon Lanval and Graelent. This subject shall, however,
> be more fully considered under the head of Brittany.

> Romances of chivalry, it is well known, may be divided into three
> principal classes; those of Arthur and his Round Table, of Charlemagne
> and his Paladins, and those of Amadis and Palmerin, and their
> descendants and kindred. In the first, with the exception of Isaie le
> Triste, which appears to be a work of the fifteenth century, the
> fairies appear but seldom; the second exhibits them in all their
> brilliancy and power; in the third, which all belong to the literature
> of Spain, the name at least does not occur, but the enchantress
> Urganda Ia Desconecida seems equal in power to La Dame du Lac, in the
> romance of Lancelot du Lac. \[b\]

> Among the incidents of the fine old romance just alluded to, \[c\] is
> narrated the death of King Ban, occasioned by grief at the sight of
> his castle taken and in flames through the treachery of his seneschal.
> His afflicted queen had left her new-born infant on the margin of a
> lake, while she went to soothe the last moments of the expiring
> monarch. On her return, she finds her babe in the arms of a beautiful
> lady. She entreats her pathetically to restore the orphan babe; but,
> without heeding her entreaties, or even uttering a single word, she
> moves to the edge of the lake, into which she plunges and disappears
> with the child. The lady was the celebrated Dame du Lac: the child was
> Lancelot, afterwards styled Du Lac. The name of the lady was Vivienne,
> and she had dwelt "en la marche de la petite Bretaigne." Merlin the
> demon-born, the renowned enchanter, became enamoured of her, and
> taught her a portion of his art; and the ill-return she made is well
> known in the annals of female treachery. \[d\] In consequence of the
> knowledge thus acquired she became a fairy; for the author informs us
> that "the damsel who carried Lancelot to the lake was a fay, and in
> those times all those women were called fays who had to do with
> enchantments and charms--and there were many of them then, principally
> in Great Britain--and knew the power and virtues of words, of stones,
> and, of herbs, by which they were kept in youth and in beauty, and in
> great riches, as they devised." \[e\]

> The lake was *feerie,* an illusion raised by the art which the devil
> had taught Merlin, and Merlin the lady. The romance says: "The lady
> who reared him conversed only in the forest, and dwelt on the summit
> of a hill, which was much lower than that on which King Ban had died.
> In this place, where it seemed that the wood was large and deep, the
> lady had many fair houses, and very rich; and in the plain beneath
> there was a gentle little river well-stored with fish; and this place
> was so secret and so concealed, that right difficult was it for any
> one to find, for the semblance of the said lake covered it so that it
> could not be perceived." \[f\]

> When her young *protégé* had gone through his course of knightly
> education, she took him to King Arthur's court, and presented him
> there; and his subsequent history is well known.

> In the romance of Maugis d'Aygremont et de Vivian son Frère, when
> Tapinel and the female slave had stolen the two children of Duke Bevis
> of Aygremont, the former sold to the wife of Sorgalant the child which
> he had taken, whose name was Eselarmonde, and who was about fifteen
> years of age, and was "plus belle et plus blanche qu'une fée." The
> slave having laid herself to rest under a white-thorn *(aubespine),*
> was devoured by a lion and a leopard, who killed one another in their
> dispute for the infant. "And the babe lay under the thorn, and cried
> loudly, during which it came to pass that Oriande la Fée, who abode at
> Rosefleur with four other fays, came straight to this thorn; for every
> time she passed by there she used to repose under that white-thorn.
> She got down, and hearing the child cry, she came that way and looked
> at him, and said, 'By the god in whom we believe, this child here is
> lying badly *(mal gist),* and this shall be his name;' and from that
> time be was always called Maugis."

> Oriande Ia Fée brought the child home with her and her damsels; and
> having examined him, and found, by a precious ring that was in his
> ear, that he was of noble lineage, "she prayed our Lord that he would
> be pleased of his grace to make known his origin *(nation).*" When she
> had finished her prayer, she sent for her nephew Espiet, "who was a
> dwarf, and was not more than three feet high, and had his hair yellow
> as fine gold, and looked like a child of seven years, but he was more
> than a hundred; and he was one of the falsest knaves in the world, and
> knew every kind of enchantment." Espiet informed her whose child he
> was; and Oriande, having prayed to our Lord to preserve the child,
> took him with her to her castle of Rosefleur, where she had him
> baptised and named Maugis. She and her damsels reared him with great
> tenderness; and when he was old enough she put him under the care of
> her brother Baudris, "who knew all the arts of magic and necromancy,
> and was of the age of a hundred years;" and he taught what he knew to
> Maugis.

> When Maugis was grown a man, the Fay Oriande clad him in arms, and he
> became her *ami;* and she loved him "de si grand amour qu'elle doute
> fort qu'il ne se departe d'avecques elle."

> Maugis shortly afterwards achieved the adventure of gaining the
> enchanted horse Bayard, in the isle of Boucaut. Of Bayard it is said,
> when Maugis spoke to him, "Bayard estoit *feyé,* si entendoit aussi
> bien Maugis comme s'il *(Bayard)* eust parlé." On his return from the
> island, Maugis conquers and slays the Saracen admiral Anthenor, who
> had come to win the lands and castle of Oriande, and gains the sword
> Flamberge (Floberge), which, together with Bayard, he afterwards gave
> to his cousin Renaud.

> In Perceforest, Sebille la Dame du Lac, whose castle was surrounded by
> a river on which lay so dense a fog that no one could see across the
> water, though not called so, was evidently a fay. The fortnight that
> Alexander the Great and Floridas abode with her, to be cured of their
> wounds, seemed to them but as one night. During that night, "la dame
> demoura enceinte du roy dung filz, dont de ce lignage yssit Ie roi
> Artus." \[g\]

> In the same romance \[h\] we are told that "en lysle de Zellande jadis
> fut demourante une *faee* qui estoit appellee Morgane." This Morgane
> was very intimate with "ung esperit (named Zephir) qui repairoit es
> lieux acquatiques, mais jamais nestoit veu que de nuyt." Zephir had
> been in the habit of repairing to Morgane is Face from her youth up,
> "car elle estoit malicieuse et subtille et tousjours avoit moult
> desire a aucunement sçavoir des enchantemens et des conjurations." He
> had committed to her charge the young Passelyon and his cousin
> Bennucq, to be brought up, and Passelyon was detected in an intrigue
> with the young Morgane, daughter of the fay. The various adventures of
> this amorous youth form one of the most interesting portions of the
> romance.

> In Tristan de Leonois, \[i\] king Meliadus, the father of Tristan, is
> drawn to a chase *par mal engin et negromance* of a fairy who was in

> verse, we will take leave to offer some observations on a subject that
> seems to us to be in general but little understood, namely, the
> structure of our old English verse, and the proper mode of reading it.

> Our forefathers, like their Gotho-German kindred, regulated their
> verse by the number of accents, not of syllables. The foot, therefore,
> as we term it, might consist of one, two, three, or even four
> syllables, provided it had only one strongly marked accent. Further,
> the accent of a word might be varied, chiefly by throwing it on the
> last syllable, as *natúre* for *náture, honoúr* for *hónour,* etc.
> (the Italians, by the way, throw it back when two accents come into
> collision, as, *Il Pástor Fido* \[l\]*);* they also sounded what the
> French call the feminine *e* of their words, as, *In oldè dayès of the
> King Artoúr;* and so well known seems this practice to have been, that
> the copyists did not always write this *e,* relying on the skill of
> the reader to supply it. \[m\] There was only one restriction, namely,
> that it was never to come before a vowel, unless where there was a
> pause. In this way the poetry of the middle ages was just as regular
> as that of the present day; and Chaucer, when properly read, is fully
> as harmonious as Pope. But the editors of our ancient poems, with the
> exception of Tyrwhitt, seem to have been ignorant or regardless of
> this principle; and in the Canterbury Tales alone is the verse
> properly arranged.

> We will now proceed to the analysis of the romance of Sir Launfal.

> Sir Launfal was one of the knights of Arthur, who loved him well, and
> made him his steward. But when Arthur married the beautiful but frail
> Gwennere, daughter of Ryon, king of Ireland, Launfal and other
> virtuous knights manifested their dissatisfaction when she came to
> court. The queen was aware of this, and, at the first entertainment
> given by the king,

> The queen yaf *(gave)* giftès for the nones,  
> Gold and silver, precious stones,  
> Her courtesy to kythe *(show):  
> *Everiche knight she yaf broche other (*or*) ring,  
> But Sir Launfel she yaf no thing,  
> That grieved him many a sythe
>
> (time).

> Launfal, under the feigned pretext of the illness of his father, takes
> leave of the king, and retires to Karlyoun, where he lives in great
> poverty. Having obtained the loan of a horse, one holyday, he rode
> into a fair forest, where, overcome by the heat, he lay down under the
> shade of a tree, and meditated on his wretched state. In this
> situation he is attracted by the approach of two fair damsels
> splendidly arrayed.

> Their faces were white as snow on down,  
> Their rode \[n\] was red, their eyne were brown;  
> I saw never none swiche.  
> That one bare of gold a basin,  
> That other a towel white and fine,  
> Of silk that was good and riche;  
> Their kerchevès were welè skire *(clear)  
> *Araid *(striped)* with richè goldè wire--  
> Launfal began to siche--  
> They comè to him over the hoth *(heath),  
> *He was curtèis, and against them goeth,  
> And greet them mildeliche.

> They greet him courteously in return, and invite him to visit their
> mistress, whose pavilion is at hand. Sir Launfal complies with the
> invitation, and they proceed to where the pavilion lies. Nothing could
> exceed this pavilion in magnificence. It was surmounted by an *erne*
> or eagle, adorned with precious stones so rich, that the poet
> declares, and we believe, that neither Alexander nor Arthur possessed
> "none swiche jewel."

> He foundè in the paviloun  
> The kingès daughter of Oliroun,  
> Dame Tryamour that hight;  
> Her father was king of Faerie,  
> Of occientè \[o\] fer and nigh,  
> A man of mickle might.

> The beauty of dame Tryamour was beyond conception.

> For heat her cloathès down she dede  
> Almostè to her girdle stede *(place),  
> *Than lay she uncover't;  
> She was as white as lily in May,  
> Or snow that snoweth in winter's day:  
> He seigh *(saw)* never none so pert

> (lively).

> The redè rose, when she is new,  
> Against her rode was naught of hew  
> I dare well say in cert;  
> Her hairè shone as goldè wire:  
> May no man rede her attire,  
> Ne naught well think in hert

> (heart).

> This lovely dame bestows her heart on Sir Launfal, on condition of his
> fidelity. As marks of her affection, she gives him a never-failing
> purse and many other valuable presents, and dismisses him next morning
> with the assurance, that whenever he wished to see her, his wish would
> be gratified on withdrawing into a private room, where she would
> instantly be with him. This information is accompanied with a charge
> of profound secrecy on the subject of their loves.

> The knight returns to court, and astonishes every one by his riches
> and his munificence. He continues happy in the love of the fair
> Tryamour, until an untoward adventure interrupts his bliss. One day
> the queen beholds him dancing, with other knights, before her tower,
> and, inspired with a sudden affection, makes amorous advances to the
> knight. These passages of love are received on his part with an
> indignant repulse, accompanied by a declaration more enthusiastic than
> politic or courteous, that his heart was given to a dame, the foulest
> of whose maidens surpassed the queen in beauty. The offence thus given
> naturally effected an entire conversion in the queen's sentiments;
> and, when Arthur returned from hunting, like Potiphar's wife, she
> charges Launfal with attempting her honour. The charge is credited,
> and the unhappy knight condemned to be burned alive, unless he shall,
> against a certain day, produce that peerless beauty. The fatal day
> arrives; the queen is urgent for the execution of the sentence, when
> ten fair damsels, splendidly arrayed, and mounted on white palfreys,
> are descried advancing toward the palace. They announce the approach
> of their mistress, who soon appears, and by her beauty justifies the
> assertion of her knight. Sir Launfal is instantly set at liberty, and,
> vaulting on the courser his mistress had bestowed on him, and which
> was held at hand by his squire, he follows her out of the town.

> The lady rode down Cardevile,

> Oberon le fayé. The storms of rain and thunder came on as predicted,

> to await and accost the dwarf.

> "The Dwarf Fay came riding through the wood, and was clad in a robe so

> This horn was wrought by four Fairies, who had endowed it with its
> marvellous properties.

> Oberon, on bringing Huon to speech, informed him that he was the son
> of Julius Caesar, and the lady of the Hidden Island, afterwards called

> And, sweetly singing round about thy bed,  
> Strew all their blessings on thy sleeping head.
