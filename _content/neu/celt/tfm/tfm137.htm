<BLOCKQUOTE>COLONIES of Gothic Fairies, it would appear, early established themselves in the Highlands, and almost every Lowland, German, and Scandinavian Fairy or Dwarf-tale will there find its fellow. The Gaelic Fairies are very handsome in their persons; their usual attire is green. They dance and sing, lend and borrow, and they make cloth and shoes in an amazingly short space of time. They make their <I>raids </I>upon the low country, and carry off women and children; they fetch midwives to assist at the birth of their children, and mortals have spent a night at the fairy revels, and next morning found that the night had extended a hundred years. Highland fairies also take the diversion of the chase. "One Highlander," says Mc.Culloch, [a] "in passing a mountain, bears the tramp of horses, the music of the horn, and the cheering of the huntsmen; when suddenly a gallant crew of thirteen fairy hunters, dressed in green, sweep by him, the silver bosses of their bridles jingling in the night breeze."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Gael call the Fairies Daoine Shi', [b] <I>(Dheen&egrave; Shee) </I>and their habitations Shians, or Tomhans. These are a sort of turrets, resembling masses of rock or hillocks. By day they are indistinguishable, but at night they are frequently lit up with great splendour.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Brownie, too, 'shows his honest face' in the Highlands; and the mischievous water-Kelpie also appears in his equine form, and seeks to decoy unwary persons to mount him, that he may plunge with his rider into the neighbouring loch or river.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Highlanders have nearly the same ideas as their Shetland neighbours, respecting the seals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The following legends will illustrate what we have stated. [c]</BLOCKQUOTE>
