<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[These are the verses quoted in the Introduction to the "Tales and Popular Fictions." The author was very young when he wrote them; and Amanda was, like Beatrice and Laura, a mere <I>donna di mente, </I>having no real existence.]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As when a storm in vernal skies<BR>
The face of day doth stain,<BR>
And o'er the smiling landscape flies,<BR>
With mist and drizzling rain;<BR>
If chance the sun look through the shower <BR>
O'er flowery hill and dale,<BR>
Reviving Nature owns his power,<BR>
And softly sighs the gale:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So when, by anxious thoughts oppressed,<BR>
My soul sinks in despair,<BR>
When smiling hope deserts my breast,<BR>
And all is darkness there<BR>
If chance Amanda's form appear,<BR>
The gloom is chased away,<BR>
My soul once more her soft smiles cheer,<BR>
And joy resumes his sway.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then, dear Amanda, since thy smile<BR>
Has power all gloom to charm,<BR>
Oh! ever thus my cares beguile,<BR>
And guard my soul from harm.<BR>
Let Hymen's bands our fates unite,<BR>
What bliss may then be ours!--<BR>
Our days will glide, like streamlets bright,<BR>
O'erhung with fragrant flowers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
