<P ALIGN="CENTER">A FAREWELL</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>FAREWELL! farewell! the parting hour <BR>
Is come, and I must leave thee!<BR>
Oh! ne'er may aught approach thy bower <BR>
That might of bliss bereave thee!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But ever a perennial rill<BR>
Of joy, so brightly flowing,<BR>
Keep each fair thought in fragrance still <BR>
Within thy pure mind blowing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For life all charm had lost for me,<BR>
My thoughts were only sadness,<BR>
When fortune led me unto thee<BR>
To taste once more of gladness.--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I've seen the sullen shades of night<BR>
Fair nature's face concealing,<BR>
And marked how scattered rays of light <BR>
Came morn's approach revealing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The light increased, the orb of day<BR>
Clomb to the mountain's summit;<BR>
And vale and plain, and stream and bay, <BR>
Drew life and lustre from it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And as it towered in majesty,<BR>
Light all around it shedding,<BR>
It seemed a monarch, seated high,<BR>
Bliss through his realms wide spreading.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All nature joyed; I felt my heart<BR>
Distend, and fill with pleasure;<BR>
For heavenly light and warmth impart <BR>
A bliss we cannot measure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This glorious sun to me art thou,<BR>
Whose light all gloom dispelleth,<BR>
Before whose majesty I bow<BR>
When he his power revealeth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thy golden locks, thine eyes so blue, <BR>
Thy smile so sweetly playing,<BR>
Were those first shafts of light that flew, <BR>
The gloom of night warraying.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But when, more intimately known,<BR>
I found not only beauty,<BR>
But genius, taste, and truth, thine own, <BR>
Combined with filial duty:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then rose the sun, o'er all my soul<BR>
In full effulgence beaming,<BR>
And tides of joy began to roll<BR>
Beneath his radiance gleaming.--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Time still his noiseless course pursues<BR>
With unremitting vigour,<BR>
And lovely Spring each year renews <BR>
The waste of Winter's rigour.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Were mine the power, thus, like Time, <BR>
To wake again life's flowers,<BR>
And days recall of youthful prime<BR>
Passed in the Muses' bowers;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then, lovely maiden! fancy-free,<BR>
Rich in each mental treasure,<BR>
In me thou wouldst a votary see--<BR>
Thy will would be my pleasure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But while such bliss might not be mine, <BR>
A friendship pure and holy<BR>
I offered at the hallowed shrine,<BR>
To which my heart turned solely.--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When distant from thee many a mile,<BR>
High waves between us swelling,<BR>
I'll think upon thy lovely smile,<BR>
Of pure emotion telling.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sky will show me thy blue eye; <BR>
The whispering breeze of even<BR>
Recall that voice, whose melody<BR>
Oft lapped my soul in heaven!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sinking sun thy ringlets' gold<BR>
Will show; but memory only<BR>
The treasures of thy mind unfold<BR>
To me when musing lonely.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Oh! may I hope that memory, <BR>
That power for ever changing,<BR>
Will make thee sometimes think on me,<BR>
O'er distant mountains ranging?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Say me not nay; let Fancy cheat<BR>
My soul with bland illusion;<BR>
And let not Doubt my vision sweet<BR>
Dispel by rude intrusion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
