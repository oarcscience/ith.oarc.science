THE FAIRY-CHAPMAN

>  

> A MAN being desirous of disposing of a horse he had at that time no
> great occasion for, and riding him to market for that purpose, was
> accosted in passing over the mountains by a little man in a plain
> dress, who asked him if he would sell his horse. "Tis the design I am
> going on," replied he: on which the other desired to know the price.
> "Eight pounds," said he. "No," returned the purchaser, "I will give no
> more than seven, which if you will take, here is your money." The
> owner thinking he had bid pretty fair, agreed with him, and the money
> being told out, the one dismounted and the other got on the back of
> the horse, which he had no sooner done than both beast and rider sunk
> into the earth immediately, leaving the person who had made the
> bargain in the utmost terror and consternation. As soon as he had a
> little recovered himself he went directly to the parson of the parish,
> and related what had passed, desiring he would give his opinion
> whether be ought to make use of the money he had received or not. To
> which

> he replied, that as he had made a fair bargain, and no way
> circumvented nor endeavoured to circumvent the buyer, he saw no reason
> to believe, in case it was an evil spirit, it could have any power
> over him. On this assurance, he went borne well satisfied, and nothing
> afterwards happened to give him any disquiet concerning this affair.
> This was told to Waldron by the person to whom it happened.
