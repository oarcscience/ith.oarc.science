ORIENTAL ROMANCE \[a\]

Persian Romance

<span id="img_03"></span> ![](img/03.jpg)

>   
> The pure and simple religion of ancient Persia, onginating, it is
> said, with a pastoral and hunting race among the lofty bills of
> Aderbijan, or, as others think, in the elevated plains of Bactria, in
> a region where light appears in all its splendour, took as its
> fundamental principle the opposition between light and darkness, and
> viewed that opposition as a conflict. Light was happiness; and the
> people of Iran, the land of light, were the favourites of Heaven;
> while those of Turan, the gloomy region beyond the mountains to the
> north, were its enemies. In the realms of supernal light sits
> enthroned Ormuzd, the first-born of beings; around him are the six
> Amshaspands, the twenty-eight Izeds, and the countless myriads of
> Ferohers. \[b\] In the opposite kingdom of darkness

> Aherman is supreme, and his throne is encompassed by the six
> Arch-Deevs, and the numerous hosts of inferior Deevs. Between these
> rival powers ceaseless warfare prevails; but at the end the prince of
> darkness will be subdued, and peace and happiness prevail beneath the
> righteous sway of Ormuzd.

> From this sublime system of religion probably arose the Peri- \[c\] or
> Fairy-system of modern Persia; and thus what was once taught by sages,
> and believed by monarchs, has shared the fate of everything human, and
> has sunk from its pristine rank to become the material and the
> machinery of poets and romancers. The wars waged by the fanatical
> successors of the Prophet, in which literature was confounded with
> idolatry, have deprived us of the means of judging of this system in
> its perfect form; and in what has been written respecting the Peries
> and their country since Persia has received the law of Mohammed, the
> admixture of the tenets and ideas of Islam is evidently perceptible.
> If, however, Orientalists be right in their interpretation of the name
> of Artaxerxes' queen, Parisatis, as Pari-zadeh \[d\] *(Peri-born),*
> the Peri must be coeval with the religion of Zoroaster.

> The Peries and Deevs of the modern Persians answer to the good and
> evil Jinn of the Arabs, of whose origin and nature we shall presently
> give an account. The same Suleymans ruled over them as over the Jinn,
> and both alike were punished for disobedience. It is difficult to say
> which is the original; but when we recollect in how much higher. a
> state of culture the Persians were than the Arabs, and how well this
> view accords with their ancient system of religion, we shall feel
> inclined to believe that the Arabs were the borrowers, and that by
> mingling with the Persian system ideas derived from the Jews, that one
> was formed by them which is now the common property of all Moslems.

> In like manner we regard the mountains of Kaf, the abode alike of Jinn
> and of Peries and Deevs, as having belonged originally to Persian
> geography. The fullest account of it appears in the Persian romance of
> Hatim Tai \[e\] the hero of which often visited its regions. From this
> it would seem that this mountain-range was regarded as, like that of
> the ancient Greek cosmology, surrounding the flat circular earth like
> a ring, or rather like the bulwarks of a ship, outside of which flowed
> the ocean; while some Arab authorities make it to lie beyond, and to
> enclose the ocean as well as the earth. \[f\] It is said to be
> composed of green chrysolite, the reflection of which gives its
> greenish tint to the sky. According to some, its height is two
> thousand English miles.

> Jinnestan is the common appellation of the whole of this ideal region.
> Its respective empires were divided into many kingdoms, containing
> numerous provinces and cities. Thus in the Peri-realms we meet with
> the luxuriant province of Shad-u-kam *(Pleasure and Delight),* with
> its magnificent capital Juherabad *(Jewel-city),* whose two kings
> solicited the aid of Caherman against the Deevs \[g\] and also the
> stately Amberabad *(Amber-city),* and others equally splendid. The
> metropolis of the Deev-empire is named Ahermanabad *(Aherman's* city);
> and imagination has lavished its stores in the description of the
> enchanted castle, palace, and gallery of the Deev monarch, Arzshenk.

> The Deevs and Peries wage incessant war with each other. Like mankind,
> they are subject to death, but after a much longer period of
> existence; and, though far superior to man in power, they partake of
> his sentiments and passions.

> We are told that when the Deevs in their wars make, prisoners of the
> Peries, they shut them up in iron cages, and hang them from the tops
> of the highest trees, exposed to every gaze and to every chilling
> blast. Here their companions visit them, and bring them the choicest
> odours to feed on; for the ethereal Peri lives on perfume, which has
> moreover the property of repelling the cruel Deevs, whose malignant
> nature is impatient of fragrance. \[h\]

> When the Peries are unable to withstand their foes, they solicit the
> aid of some mortal hero. Enchanted arms and talismans enable him to
> cope with the gigantic Deevs, and he is conveyed to Jinnestan on the
> back of some strange and wonderful animal. His adventures in that
> country usually furnish a wide field for poetry and romance to
> expatiate in.

> The most celebrated adventurer in Jinnestan was Tahmuras, surnamed
> Deev-bend *(Deev-binder),* \[i\] one of the ancient kings of Persia.
> The Peries sent him a splendid embassy, and the Deevs, who dreaded
> him, despatched another. Tahmuras, in doubt how to act, consults the
> wonderful bird Seemurgh, \[j\] who speaks all languages, and whose
> knowledge embraces futurity. She advises him to aid the Peries, warns
> him of the dangers he has to encounter, and discloses his proper line
> of action. She further offers to convey him to Jinnestan, and plucks
> some feathers from her breast, with which the Persian monarch adorns
> his helmet.

> Mounted on the Seemurgh, and bracing on his arm the potent buckler of
> Jan-ibn-Jan. \[k\] Tahmuras crosses the abyss impassable to unaided
> mortality. The vizier Imlan, who had headed the Deev embassy,
> deserting his original friends, had gone over to Tahmuras, and through
> the magic arts of the Deev, and his own daring valour, the Persian
> hero defeats the Deev-king Arzshenk. He next vanquishes a Deev still
> more fierce, named Demrush, who dwelt in a gloomy cavern, surrounded
> by piles of wealth plundered from the neighbouring realms of Persia
> and India. Here Tahmuras finds a fair captive, the Peri Merjan, \[l\]
> whom Demrush had carried off, and whom her brothers, Dal Peri and
> Milan Shah Peri, had long sought in vain. He chains the Deev in the
> centre of the mountain, and at the suit of Merjan hastens to attack
> another powerful Deev named Houndkonz; but here, alas! fortune deserts
> him, and, maugre his talismans and enchanted arms, the gallant
> Tahmuras falls beneath his foe.

> The great Deev-bend, or conqueror of Deevs, of the Shah-Nameh \[m\] is
> the illustrious Roostem. In the third of his Seven Tables or
> adventures, on his way to relieve the Shah Ky-Caoos, whom the artifice
> of a Deev had led to Mazenderan, where he was in danger of perishing,
> he encounters in the dark of the night a Deev named Asdeev, who stole
> on him in a dragon's form as he slept. Twice the hero's steed, Reksh,
> awoke him, but each time the Deev vanished, and Roostem was near
> slaying his good steed for giving him a false alarm. The third time be
> saw the Deev and slew him after a fearful combat. He then pursued his
> way to the cleft in the mountain in which abode the great Deev Sefeed,
> or White Deev. The seventh Table brought him to where lay an army of
> the Deev Sefeed's Deevs, commanded by Arzshenk, whose head he struck
> off, and put his troops to flight. At length he reached the gloomy
> cavern of the Deev Sefeed himself whom be found asleep, and scorning
> the advantage he awoke him, and after a terrific combat deprived him
> also of life.

> Many years after, when Ky-Khosroo sat on the throne, a wild ass of
> huge size, his skin like the sun, and a black stripe along his back,
> appeared among the royal herds and destroyed the horses. It was
> supposed to be the Deev Akvan,who was known to haunt an adjacent
> spring. Roostem went in quest of him; on the fourth day he found him
> and cast his noose at him, but the Deev vanished. He re-appeared; the
> hero shot at him, but he became again invisible. Roostem then let
> Reksh graze, and laid him to sleep by the fount. As he slept, Akvan
> came and flew up into the air with him; and when he awoke, he gave him
> his choice of being let fall on the mountains or the sea. Roostem
> secretly chose the latter, and to obtain it he pretended to have heard
> that he who was drowned never entered paradise. Akvan thereupon let
> him fall into the sea, from which he escaped, and returning to the
> fount, he there met and slew the Deev. Roostem's last encounter with
> Deeva was with Akvan's son, Berkhyas, and his army, when he went to
> deliver Peshen from the dry well in which he was confined by Afrasiab.
> He slew him and two-thirds of his troops. Berkhyas is described as
> being a mountain in size, his face black, his body covered with hair,
> his neck like that of a dragon, two boar's tusks from his mouth, his
> eyes wells of blood, his hair bristling like needles, his height 140
> ells, his breadth 17, pigeons nestling in his snaky locks. Akvan had
> had a head like an elephant.

> In the Hindoo-Persian Bahar Danush *(Garden of Knowledge)* of
> Ynyet-ullah, written in India A.D. 165O, \[n\] we find the following
> tale of the Peries, which has a surprising resemblance to European
> legends hereafter to be noticed. \[o\]
