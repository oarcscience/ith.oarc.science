THE TROLL WIFE

>  

> THE grandfather of Reor, who dwelt at Fuglekärr (i.e. *Bird-marsh),*
> in the parish of Svartsborg *(Black-castle),* lived close to a hill,
> and one time, in the broad daylight, be saw sitting there on a stone a
> comely maiden. He wished to intercept her, and for this purpose *he
> threw steel* between her and the hill; whereupon her father laughed
> within the hill, and opening the hill-door asked him if he would have
> his daughter. He replied in the affirmative and as she was *stark
> naked* he took some of his own clothes and covered her with them, and
> he afterwards had her christened. As he was going away, her father
> said. to him, "When you are going to have your wedding *(bröllup)* you
> must provide twelve barrels of beer and bake a heap of bread and the
> flesh of four oxen, and drive to the barrow or hill where I keep, and
> when the bridal gifts are to be bestowed, depend on it I will give
> mine." This also came to pass; for when others were giving he raised
> the cover of the cart and cast into it so large a bag of money that
> the body of it nearly broke, saying at the same time:--" This is *my*
> gift!" He said, moreover, "When you want to have your wife's portion
> *(hemmagifta),*\[a\] you must drive to the hill with four horses, and
> get your share. When he came there afterwards at his desire he got
> copper-pots, the one larger than the other till the largest pot of all
> was filled with the smaller ones. He also gave him other things, \[b\]
> which were helmets, of that colour and fashion which are large and
> thick, and which are still remaining in the country, being preserved
> at the parsonage of Tanum. This man Reor's father surnamed I
> Foglekärsten, had a number of children by this wife of his, whom he
> fetched out of the hill, among whom was the aforesaid Reor. Olaf
> Stenson also in Stora Rijk, who died last year, was Reor's sister's
> son. \[c\]

> \[a\] This we suppose to be the meaning of *hemmagifta,* as it Is that
> of *hemgift,* the only word approaching to it that we have met in our
> dictionary.  
>   
> \[b\] *Brandcreatur,* a word of which we cannot ascertain the exact
> meaning. We doubt greatly if the following *hielmeta* be helmets.  
>   
> \[c\] Grimm (Deut. Mythol. p. 435) has extracted this legend from the
> Bahuslän of Odman, who, as he observes, and as we may see, relates it
> quite seriously, and with the real names of persons. It is we believe
> the only legend of the union of a *man* with one of the hill-folk.
