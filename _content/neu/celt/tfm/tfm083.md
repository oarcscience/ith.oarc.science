INGE OF RANTUM

>  

> THE Friesland. girls are, however, rather shy of these matches, and if
> they have unwarily been drawn into an engagement they try to get out
> of it if they possibly can.

> A girl named Inge of Rantum had some way or other got into an
> engagement with one of the Underground people. The wedding-day was
> actually fixed, and she could only be released from her bond on one
> condition--that of being able, before it came, to tell the real name
> of her lover. All her efforts to that effect were in vain, the dreaded
> day was fast approaching and she fell into deep melancholy. On the
> morning of her wedding-day she went out and strolled in sorrowful mood
> through the fields, saying to herself as she plucked some flowers,
> "Far happier are these flowers than I." As she was stooping to gather
> them, she thought she heard a noise under the ground. She listened and
> recognised it as the voice of her lover, who, in the excess of his joy
> at the arrival of his wedding-day, was frolicking and singing, "To-day
> I must bake and boil and roast and broil and wash and brew; for this
> is my wedding-day. My bride is the fair Inge of Rantum, and my name is
> Ekke Nekkepem. Hurrah! Nobody knows *that* but myself!" "Aye, but *I*
> know it too!" said Inge softly to herself and she placed her nosegay
> in her bosom and went home. Toward evening came the Dwarf to claim his
> bride. "Many thanks, dear Ekke Nekkepem," said she, "but if you please
> I would rather stay where I am." The smiling face of the bridegroom
> grew dark as thunder, but he recollected how he had divulged his
> secret, and saw that the affair was past remedy.

> The Nis of Sutland is called Puk \[a\] in Friesland. Like him he wears
> a pointed red cap, with a long grey or green jacket, and slippers on
> his feet. His usual abode is under the roof, and he goes in and out
> either through a broken window, which is never mended, or through some
> other aperture left on purpose for him. A bowl of groute must be left
> on the floor for him every evening, and he is very angry if there
> should be no butter in it. When well treated he makes himself very
> useful by cleaning up the house, and tending the cattle. He sometimes
> amuses himself by playing tricks on the servants, tickling, for
> example, their noses when they are asleep, or pulling off the
> bedclothes. Stories are told of the Puk, similar to some above related
> of the Juttish Nis.
