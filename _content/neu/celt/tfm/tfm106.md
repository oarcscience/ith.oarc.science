> THE Fairy Mythology of England divides itself into two branches, that
> of the people and that of the poets. Under the former head will be
> comprised the few scattered traditions which we have been able to
> collect respecting a system, the belief in which is usually thought to
> be nearly extinct; the latter will contain a selection of passages,
> treating of fairies and their exploits, from our principal poets.

> The Fairies of England are evidently the Dwarfs of Germany and the
> North, though they do not appear to have been ever so denominated.
> \[a\] Their appellation was Elves, subsequently Fairies; but there
> would seem to have been formerly other terms expressive of them, of
> which hardly a vestige is now remaining in the English language.

> They were, like their northern kindred, divided into two classes--the
> rural Elves, inhabiting the woods, fields, mountains, and caverns; and
> the domestic or house-spirits, usua called Hobgoblins and Robin
> Goodfellows. But the Thames, the Avon, and the, other English streams,
> never seem to have been the abode of a Neck or Kelpie.

> The following curious instances of English superstition, occur in the
> twelfth century.
