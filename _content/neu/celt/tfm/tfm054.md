THE NISSES IN VOSBORG

>  

> THERE was once an exceeding great number of Nisses in Jutland. Those
> in Vosborg in particular were treated with so much liberality, that
> they were careful and solicitous beyond measure for 'their master's
> interest. They got every evening in their sweet-groute a large lump of
> butter, and in return for this, they once showed great zeal and
> gratitude.

> One very severe winter, a lonely house in which there were six calves
> was so completely covered by the snow, that for the space of fourteen
> days no one, could get into it. When the snow was gone, the people
> naturally thought that the calves were all dead of hunger; but far
> from it, they found them all in excellent condition; the place cleaned
> up, and the cribs full of beautiful corn, so that it was quite evident
> the Nisses had attended to them.

> But, the Nis, though thus grateful when well treated, is sure to
> avenge himself when any one does anything to annoy and vex him. As a
> Nis was one day amusing himself by running on the loft over the
> cow-house, one of the boards gave way and his leg went through. The
> boy happened to be in the cow-house when this happened, and when he
> saw the Nis's leg hanging down, he took up a dung fork, and gave him
> with it a smart rap on the leg. At noon; when the people were sitting
> round the table in the hall, the boy sat continually laughing to
> himself. The bailiff asked him what be was laughing at; and the boy
> replied, "Oh! a got such a blow at Nis to-day, and a gave him such a
> hell of a rap with my fork, when he put his leg down through the
> loft." "No," cried Nis, outside of the window, "it was not one, but
> three blows you gave me, for there were three prongs on the fork; but
> I shall pay you for it, my lad."

> Next night, while the boy was lying fast asleep, Nis came and took him
> up and brought him out into the yard, then flung him over the house,
> and was so expeditious in getting to the other side of the house, that
> he caught him before he came to the ground, and instantly pitched him
> over again, and kept going on with this sport till the boy had been
> eight times backwards and forwards over the roof, and the ninth time
> he let him fall into a great pool of water, and then set up such a
> shout of laughter at him, that it wakened up all the people that were
> in the place.

> In Sweden the Tomte is sometimes seen at noon, in summer, slowly and
> stealthily dragging a straw or an ear of corn. A farmer, seeing him
> thus engaged, laughed, and said, "What difference does it make if you
> bring away that or nothing?" The Tomte in displeasure left his farm,
> and went to that of his neighbour; and with him went all prosperity
> from him who had made light of him, and passed over to the other
> farmer. Any one who treated the industrious Tomte with respect, and
> set store by the smallest straw, became rich, and neatness and
> regularity prevailed in his household. \[a\]

> \[a\] Afzelius, Sago Häfdar., ii. 169. On Christmas-morning, he says,
> the peasantry gives the Tomte, his wages. i. *e.* a piece of grey
> cloth, tobacco, and a

> shovelful of clay.
