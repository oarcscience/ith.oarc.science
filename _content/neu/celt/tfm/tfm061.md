SHETLAND

>  

> Well, since we are welcome to Yule,  
> Up wi 't Lightfoot, link it awa', boys!  
> Send for a fiddler, play up Foula reel,  
> The Shaalds will pay for a', boys.  
> SHETLAND SONG.

>  

> DR. HIBBERT's valuable work on the Shetland Islands \[a\] fortunately
> enables us to give a tolerably complete account of the fairy system of
> these islands.

> The Shetlanders, he informs us, believe in two kinds of Trows, as they
> call the Scandinavian Trolls, those of the land and those of the sea.

> The former, whom, like the Scots, they also term the *guid folk* and
> *guid neighbours,* they conceive to inhabit the interior of green
> hills. Persons who have been brought into their habitations have been
> dazzled with the splendour of what they saw there. All the interior
> walls are adorned with gold and silver, and the domestic utensils
> resemble the strange things that are found sometimes lying on the
> hills. These persons have always entered the hill on one side and gone
> out at the other.

> They marry and have children, like their northern kindred. A woman of
> the island of Yell, who died not long since, at the advanced age of
> more than a hundred years, said, that she once met some fairy
> children, accompanied by a little dog, playing like other boys and
> girls, on the top of a hill. Another time she happened one night to
> raise herself up in the bed, when she saw a little boy with a white
> nightcap on his head, sitting at the fire. She asked him who he was.
> "I am Trippa's son," said he. When she heard this, she instantly
> *sained,* i. e. blessed herself, and Trippa's son vanished.

> Saining is the grand protection against them; a Shetlander always
> sains himself when passing by their hills.

> The Trows are of a diminutive stature, and they are usually dressed in
> gay green garments. When travelling from one place to another they may
> be seen mounted on bulrushes, and riding through the air. If a person
> should happen to meet them when on these journeys, he should, if be
> has not a bible in his pocket, draw a circle round him on the ground,
> and in God's name forbid their approach. They then generally
> disappear. \[b\]

> They are fond of music and dancing, and it is their dancing that forms
> the fairy rings. A Shetlander lying awake in bed before day one
> morning, heard the noise of a party of Trows passing by his door. They
> were preceded by a piper, who was playing away lustily. The man
> happened to have a good ear for music, so he picked up the tune he
> heard played, and used often after to repeat it for his friends under
> the name of the Fairy-tune.

> The Trows are not free from disease, but they are possessed of
> infallible remedies, which they sometimes bestow on their favourites.
> A man in the island of Unst had an earthen pot that contained an
> ointment of marvellous power. This he said he got from the hills, and,
> like the widow's cruise, its contents never failed.

> They have all the picking and stealing propensities of the
> Scandinavian Trolls. The dairy-maid sometimes detects a Trow-woman
> secretly milking the cows in the byre. She sains herself; and the
> thief takes to flight so precipitately as to leave behind her a copper
> pan of a form never seen before

> When they want beef or mutton on any festal occasion, they betake
> themselves to the Shetlanders' *scatholds* or town-mails, and with
> elf-arrows bring down their game. On these occasions they delude the
> eyes of the owner with the appearance of something exactly resembling
> the animal whom they have carried off, and by its apparent violent
> death by some accident. it is on this account that the flesh of such
> animals as have met a sudden or violent death is regarded as improper
> food.

> A Shetlander, who is probably still alive, affirmed that he was once
> taken into a hill by the Trows. Here one of the first objects that met
> his view was one of his own cows, that was brought in to furnish
> materials for a banquet. He regarded himself as being in rather a
> ticklish situation if it were not for the protection of the
> Trow-women, by whose favour he had been admitted within the hill. On
> returning home, he learned, to his great surprise, that at the very
> moment he saw the cow brought into the hill, others had seen her
> falling over the rocks.

> Lying-in-women and "unchristened bairns" they regard as lawful prize.
> The former they employ as wet-nurses, the latter they of course rear
> up as their own. Nothing will induce parents to show any attention to
> a child that they suspect of being a changeling. But there are persons
> who undertake to enter the hills and regain the lost child.

> A tailor, not long since, related the following story. He was employed
> to work at a farm-house where there was a child that was an idiot, and
> who was supposed to have been left there by the Trows instead of some
> proper child, whom they had taken into the hills. One night, after he
> had retired to his bed, leaving the idiot asleep by the lire, he was
> suddenly waked out of his sleep by the sound of music, and on looking
> about him he saw the whole room full of fairies, who were dancing away
> their rounds most joyously. Suddenly the idiot jumped up and joined in
> the dance, and showed such a degree of acquaintance with the various
> steps and movements as plainly testified that it must have been a long
> time since be first went under the hands of the dancing-master. The
> tailor looked on for some time with admiration, but at last he grew
> alarmed and *sained* himself. On hearing this, the Trows all fled in
> the utmost disorder, but one of them, a woman, was so incensed at this
> interruption of their revels, that as she went out she touched the big
> toe of the tailor, and he lost the power of ever after moving it.
> \[c\]

> In these cases of paralysis they believe that the Trows have taken
> away the sound member and left a log behind. They even sometimes sear
> the part, and from the want of sensation in it boast of the
> correctness of this opinion. \[d\]

> With respect to the Sea-Trows, it is the belief of the Shetlanders
> that they inhabit a region of their own at the bottom of the sea.
> \[e\] They here respire a peculiar atmosphere, and live in habitations
> constructed of the choicest submarine productions. When they visit the
> upper world on occasions of business or curiosity, they are obliged to
> enter the skin of some animal capable of respiring in the water. One
> of the shapes they assume is that of what is commonly called a merman
> or mermaid, human from the waist upwards, terminating below in the
> tail of a fish. But their most favourite vehicle is the skin of the
> larger seal or Haaf fish, for as this animal is amphibious they can
> land on some rock, and there cast off their sea-dress and assume their
> own shape, and amuse themselves as they will in the upper world. They
> must, however, take especial care of their skins, as each has but one,
> and if that should be lost, the owner can never re-descend, but must
> become an inhabitant of the supramarine world.

> The following Shetland tales will illustrate this:

> Shetlanders respecting this submarine country.
