THE DWARF'S BANQUET

A Norwegian Tale \[a\]

>  

> THERE lived in Norway, not far from the city of Drontheim, a powerful
> man, who was blessed with all the goods of fortune. A part of the
> surrounding country was his property; numerous herds fed on his
> pastures, and a great retinue and a crowd of servants adorned his
> mansion. He had an only daughter, called Aslog, \[b\] the fame of
> whose beauty spread far and wide. The greatest men of the country
> sought her, but all were alike unsuccessful in their suit, and he who
> had come full of confidence and joy, rode away home silent and
> melancholy. Her father, who thought his daughter delayed her choice
> only to select, forbore to interfere, and exulted in her prudence. But
> when, at length, the richest and noblest had tried their fortune with
> as little success as the rest, he grew angry, and called his daughter,
> and said to her," Hitherto I have left you to your free choice, but
> since I see that you reject all without any distinction, and the very
> best of your suitors seem not good enough for you, I will keep
> measures no longer with you. What! shall my family be extinct, and my
> inheritance pass away into the hands of strangers? I will break your
> stubborn spirit. I give you now till the festival of the great
> Winter-night; make your choice by that time, or prepare to accept him
> whom I shall fix on."

> Aslog loved a youth called Orm, handsome as he was brave and noble.
> She loved him with her whole soul, and she would sooner die than
> bestow her hand on another. But Orm was poor, and poverty compelled
> him to serve in the mansion of her father. Aslog's partiality for him
> was kept a secret; for her father's pride of power and wealth was such
> that he would never have given his consent to an union with so humble
> a man.

> When Aslog saw the darkness of his countenance, and heard his angry
> words, she turned pale as death, for she knew his temper, and doubted
> not but that he would put his threats into execution. Without uttering
> a word in reply, she retired to her silent chamber, and thought deeply
> but in vain how to avert the dark storm that hung over her. The great
> festival approached nearer and nearer, and her anguish increased every
> day.

> At last the lovers resolved on flight. "I know," says Orm, "a secure
> place where we may remain undiscovered until we find an opportunity of
> quitting the country." At night, when all were asleep, Orm led the
> trembling Aslog over the snow and ice-fields away to the mountains.
> The moon and the stars sparkling still brighter in the cold winter's
> night lighted them on their way. They had under their arms a few
> articles of dress and some skins of animals, which were all they could
> carry. They ascended the mountains the whole night long till they
> reached a lonely spot inclosed with lofty rocks. Here Orm conducted
> the weary Aslog into a cave, the low and narrow entrance to which was
> hardly perceptible, but it soon enlarged to a great hall, reaching
> deep into the mountain. He kindled a fire, and they now, reposing on
> their skins, sat in the deepest solitude far away from all the world.

> Orm was the first who had discovered this cave, which is shown to this
> very day, and as no one knew any thing of it, they were safe from the
> pursuit of Aslog's father. They passed the whole winter in this
> retirement. Orm used to go a hunting, and Aslog stayed at home in the
> cave, minded the fire, and prepared the necessary food. Frequently did
> she mount the points of the rocks, but her eyes wandered as far as
> they could reach only over glittering snow-fields.

> The spring now came on--the woods were green--the meads put on their
> various colours, and Aslog could but rarely and with circumspection
> venture to leave the cave. One evening Orm came in with the
> intelligence that he had recognised her father's servants in the
> distance, and that he could hardly have been unobserved by them, whose
> eyes were as good as his own. "They will surround this place,"
> continued he, "and never rest till they have found us; we must quit
> our retreat, then, without a moment's delay."

> They accordingly descended on the other side of the mountain, and
> reached the strand, where they fortunately found a boat. Orm shoved
> off, and the boat drove into the open sea. They had escaped their
> pursuers, but they were now exposed to dangers of another kind:
> whither should they turn themselves? They could not venture to land,
> for Aslog's father was lord of the whole coast, and they would
> infallibly fall into his hands. Nothing then remained for them but to
> commit their bark to the wind and waves. They drove along the entire
> night. At break of day the coast had disappeared, and they saw nothing
> but the sky above, the sea beneath, and the waves that rose and fell.
> They had not brought one morsel of food with them, and thirst and
> hunger began now to torment them. Three days did they toss about in
> this state of misery, and Aslog, faint and exhausted, saw nothing but
> certain death before her.

> At length, on the evening of the third day, they discovered an island
> of tolerable magnitude, and surrounded by a number of smaller ones.
> Orm immediately steered for it, but just as he came near it there
> suddenly rose a violent wind, and the sea rolled every moment higher
> and higher against him. He turned about with a view of approaching it
> on another side, but with no better success; his vessel, as oft as it
> approached the island, was driven back as if by an invisible power.
> "Lord God!" cried he, and blessed himself and looked on poor Aslog,
> who seemed to be dying of weakness before his eyes. But scarcely had
> the exclamation passed his lips when the storm ceased, the waves
> subsided, and the vessel came to the shore, without encountering any
> hindrance. Orm jumped out on the beach; some mussels that he found on
> the strand strengthened and revived the exhausted Aslog, so that she
> was soon able to leave the boat.

> The island was overgrown with low dwarf shrubs, and seemed to be
> uninhabited; but when they had gotten about to the middle of it, they
> discovered a house reaching but a little above the ground, and
> appearing to be half under the surface of the earth. In the hope of
> meeting human beings and assistance, the wanderers approached it. They
> listened if they could hear any noise, but the most perfect silence
> reigned there. Orm at length opened the door, and with his companion
> walked in; but what was their surprise, to find everything regulated
> and arranged as if for inhabitants, yet not a single living creature
> visible. The fire was burning on the hearth, in the middle of the
> room, and a pot with fish hung on it apparently only waiting for some
> one to take it up and eat it. The beds were made and ready to receive
> their wearied tenants. Orm and Aslog stood for some time dubious, and
> looked on with a certain degree of awe, but at last, overcome by
> hunger, they took up the food and ate. When they had satisfied their
> appetites, and still in the last beams of the setting sun, which now
> streamed over the island far and wide, discovered no human being, they
> gave way to weariness, and laid themselves in the beds to which they
> had been so long strangers.

> They had expected to be awakened in the night by the owners of the
> house on their return home, but their expectation was not fulfilled;
> they slept undisturbed till the morning sun shone in upon them. No one
> appeared on any of the following days, and it seemed as if some
> invisible power had made ready the house for their reception. They
> spent the whole summer in perfect happiness--they were, to be sure,
> solitary, yet they did not miss mankind. The wild birds' eggs, and the
> fish they caught, yielded them provisions in abundance.

> When autumn came, Aslog brought forth a son. In the midst of their joy
> at his appearance, they were surprised by a wonderful apparition. The
> door opened on a sudden, and an old woman stepped in. She had on her a
> handsome blue dress: there was something proud, but at the same time
> something strange and surprising in her appearance.

> "Do not be afraid," said she, "at my unexpected appearance--I am the
> owner of this house, and I thank you for the clean and neat state in
> which you have kept it, and for the good order in which I find
> everything with you. I would willingly have come sooner, but I had no
> power to do so till this little heathen (pointing to the new
> born-babe) was come to the light. Now I have free access. Only fetch
> no priest from the main-land to christen it, or I must depart again.
> If you will in this matter comply with my wishes, you may not only
> continue to live here, but all the good that ever you can wish for I
> will do you. Whatever you take in hand shall prosper; good luck shall
> follow you wherever you go. But break this condition, and depend upon
> it that misfortune after misfortune will come on you, and even on this
> child will I avenge myself. If you want anything, or are in danger,
> you have only to pronounce my name three times and I will appear and
> lend you assistance. I am of the race of the old Giants, and my name
> is Guru. But beware of uttering in my presence the name of him whom no
> Giant may hear of, and never venture to make the sign of the cross, or
> to cut it on beam or board in the house. You may dwell in this house
> the whole year long, only be so good as to give it up to me on Yule
> evening, when the sun is at the lowest, as then we celebrate our great
> festival, and then only are we permitted to be merry. At least, if you
> should not be willing to go out of the house, keep yourselves up in
> the loft as quiet as possible the whole day long, and as you value
> your lives do not look down into the room until midnight is past.
> After that you may take possession of everything again."

> When the old woman had thus spoken she vanished, and Aslog and Orm,
> now at ease respecting their situation, lived without any disturbance
> contented and happy. Orm never made a cast of his net without getting
> a plentiful draught; he never shot an arrow from his bow that it was
> not sure to hit; in short, whatever they took in hand, were it ever so
> trifling, evidently prospered.

> When Christmas came, they cleaned up the house in the best manner, set
> everything in order, kindled a fire on the hearth, and as the twilight
> approached, they went up to the loft, where they remained quite still
> and quiet. At length it grew dark; they thought they heard a sound of
> whizzing and snorting in the air, such as the swans use to make in the
> winter tune. There was a hole in the roof over the fireplace which
> might be opened and shut either to let in the light from above, or to
> afford a free passage for the smoke. Orm lifted up the lid, which was
> covered with a skin, and put out his head. But what a wonderful sight
> then presented itself to his eyes. The little islands around were all
> lit up with countless blue lights, which moved about without ceasing,
> jumped up and down, then skipped down to the shore, assembled
> together, and came nearer and nearer to the large island where Orm and
> Aslog lived. At last they reached it, and arranged themselves in a
> circle around a large stone not far from the shore, and which Orm well
> knew. But what was his surprise, when he saw that the stone had flow
> completely assumed the form of a man, though of a monstrous and
> gigantic one! He could clearly perceive that the little blue lights
> were borne by Dwarfs, whose pale clay-coloured faces, with their huge
> noses and red eyes, disfigured too by birds' bills and owls' eyes,
> were supported by mis-shapen bodies; and they tottered and wabbled
> about here and there, so that they seemed to be at the same time merry
> and in pain. Suddenly, the circle opened; the little ones retired on
> each side, and Guru, who was now much enlarged and of as immense a
> size as the stone, advanced with gigantic steps. She threw both her
> arms round the stone image, which immediately began to receive life
> and motion. As soon as the first symptom of motion showed itself, the
> little ones began, with wonderful capers and grimaces, a song, or to
> speak more properly, a howl, with which the whole island resounded and
> seemed to tremble at the noise. Orm, quite terrified, drew in his
> head, and he and Aslog remained in the dark, so still, that they
> hardly ventured to draw their breath.

> The procession moved on toward the house, as might be clearly
> perceived by the nearer approach of the shouting and crying. They were
> now all come in, and, light and active, the Dwarfs jumped about on the
> benches; and heavy and loud sounded at intervals the steps of the
> giants. Orm and his wife heard them covering the table, and the
> clattering of the plates, and the shouts of joy with which they
> celebrated their banquet. When it was over and it drew near to
> midnight, they began to dance to that ravishing fairy-air which charms
> the mind into such sweet confusion, and which some have heard in the
> rocky glens, and learned by listening to the underground musicians. As
> soon as Aslog caught the sound of this air, she felt an irresistible
> longing to see the dance. Nor was Orm able to keep her back. "Let me
> look," said she, "or my heart will burst." She took her child and
> placed herself at the extreme end of the loft, whence, without being
> observed, she could see all that passed. Long did she gaze, without
> taking off her eyes for an instant, on the dance, on the bold and
> wonderful springs of the little creatures who seemed to float in the
> air, and not so much as to touch the ground, while the ravishing
> melody of the elves filled her whole soul. The child meanwhile, which
> lay in her arms, grew sleepy and drew its breath heavily, and without
> ever thinking on the promise she had given the old woman, she made, as
> is usual, the sign of the cross over the mouth of the child, and said,
> "Christ bless you, my babe!"

> The instant she had spoken the word there was raised a horrible
> piercing cry. The spirits tumbled heads over heels out at the door
> with terrible crushing and crowding, their lights went out, and in a
> few minutes the whole house was clear of them, and left desolate. Orm
> and Aslog frightened to death, hid themselves in the most retired nook
> in the house. They did not venture to stir till daybreak, and not till
> the sun shone through the hole in the roof down on the fire-place did
> they feel courage enough to descend from the loft.

> The table remained still covered as the underground-people had left
> it; all their vessels, which were of silver, and manufactured in the
> most beautiful manner, were upon it. In the middle of the room, there
> stood upon the ground a huge copper vessel half full of sweet mead,
> and by the side of it, a drinking-horn of pure gold. In the corner lay
> against the wall a stringed instrument, not unlike a dulcimer, which,
> as people believe, the Giantesses used to play on. They gazed on what
> was before them, full of admiration, but without venturing to lay
> their hands on anything: but great and fearful was their amazement,
> when, on turning about, they saw sitting at the table an immense
> figure, which Orm instantly recognised as the Giant whom Guru had
> animated by her embrace. He was now a cold and hard stone. While they
> were standing gazing on it, Guru herself entered the room in her
> giant-form. She wept so bitterly, that her tears trickled down on the
> ground. It was long ere her sobbing permitted her to utter a single
> word: at last she spoke:--

> "Great affliction have you brought on me, and henceforth I must weep
> while I live; yet as I know that you have not done this with evil
> intentions, I forgive you, though it were a trifle for me to crush the
> whole house like an egg-shell over your heads."

> "Alas!" cried she, "my husband, whom I love more than myself there he
> sits, petrified for ever; never again will he open his eyes! Three
> hundred years lived I with my father on the island of Kunnan, happy in
> the innocence of youth, as the fairest among the Giant-maidens. Mighty
> heroes sued for my hand; the sea around that island is still filled
> with the rocky fragments which they hurled against each other in their
> combats. Andfind won the victory, and I plighted myself to him. But
> ere I was married came the detestable Odin into the country, who
> overcame my father, and drove us all from the island. My father and
> sisters fled to the mountains, and since that time my eyes have beheld
> them no more. Andfind and I saved ourselves on this island, where we
> for a long time lived in peace and quiet, and thought it would never
> be interrupted. But destiny, which no one escapes, had determined it
> otherwise. Oluf \[c\] came from Britain. They called him the Holy, and
> Andfind instantly found that his voyage would be inauspicious to the
> giants. When he heard how Oluf's ship rushed through the waves, he
> went down to the strand and blew the sea against him with all his
> strength. The waves swelled up like mountains. But Oluf was still more
> mighty than he; his ship flew unchecked through the billows like an
> arrow from a bow. He steered direct for our island. When the ship was
> so near that Andflnd thought he could reach it with his hands, he
> grasped at the forepart with his right hand, and was about to drag it
> down to the bottom, as he had often done with other ships. But Oluf
> the terrible Oluf, stepped forward, and crossing his hands over each
> other, he cried with a loud voice, 'Stand there as a stone, till the
> last day,' and in the same instant my unhappy husband became a mass of
> rock. The ship sailed on unimpeded, and ran direct against the
> mountain, which it cut through, and separated from it the little
> island which lies out yonder. \[d\]

> "Ever since my happiness has been annihilated, and lonely and
> melancholy have I passed my life. On Yule-eve alone can petrified
> Giants receive back their life for the space of seven hours, if one of
> their race embraces them, and is, at the same time, willing to
> sacrifice a hundred years of their own life. But seldom does a Giant
> do that. I loved my husband too well not to bring him back cheerfully
> to life every time that I could do it, even at the highest price, and
> never would I reckon how often I had done it, that I might not know
> when the time came when I myself should share his fate, and at the
> moment that I threw my arms around him become one with him. But alas!
> even this comfort is taken from me; I can never more by any embrace
> awake him, since he has heard the name which I dare not utter; and
> never again will he see the light until the dawn of the last day shall
> bring it.

> "I now go hence! You will never again behold me! All that is here in
> the house I give you! My dulcimer alone will I keep! But let no one
> venture to fix his habitation on the little islands that lie around
> here! There dwell the little underground ones whom you saw at the
> festival, and I will protect them as long as I live!"

> With these words Guru vanished. The next spring Orin took the golden
> horn and the silver ware to Drontheim,where no one knew him. The value
> of these precious metals was so great, that he was able to purchase
> everything requisite for a wealthy man. He laded his ship with his
> purchases, and returned back to the island, where he spent many years
> in unalloyed happiness, and Aslog's father was soon reconciled to his
> wealthy son-in-law.

> The stone image remained sitting in the house; no human power was able
> to move it. So hard was the stone, that hammer and axe flew in pieces
> without making the slightest impression upon it. The Giant sat there
> till a holy man came to the island, who with one single word removed
> him back to his former station, where he stands to this hour. The
> copper vessel, which the underground people left behind them, was
> preserved as a memorial upon the island, which bears the name of House
> Island to, the present day.

> \[a\] This tale was taken from oral recitation by Dr. Grimm, and
> inserted In Hauff's Märchenalmanach for 1827. Dr. Grimm's fidelity to
> tradition is too well known to leave any doubt of its genuineness.

> \[b\] AsIög *(Light of* *the Aser)* is the name of the lovely daughter
> of Sigurd and Brynhilda, who became the wife of Ragnar Lodbrok. How
> beautiful and romantic is the account in the Volsunga Saga of old
> Heimer taking her, when an infant, and carrying her about with him in
> his harp, to save her from those who sought her life as the last of
> Sigurd's race; his retiring to remote streams and waterfalls to wash
> her, and his stilling her cries by the music of his harp!

> \[c\] This is Saint Oluf or Olave, the warlike apostle of the North.

> \[d\] A legend similar to this is told of Saint Oluf in various parts
> of Scandinavia. The following is an example:--As he was sailing by the
> high strand-hills in Honsherred, in which a giantess abode, she cried
> out to him,

> Saint Oluf with the red beard hear!  
> My cellar-wall thou'rt sailing too near!

> Oluf was incensed, and instead of guiding the ship through the rocks,
> he turned it toward the hill, replying:

> Hearken thou witch with thy spindle and rock!  
> There shalt thou sit and be a stone-block!

> and scarcely had he spoken when the hill burst and the giantess was
> turned Into stone. She is still seen sitting on the east side with her
> rock and spindle; out of the opposite mass sprang a holy well. Grimm.
