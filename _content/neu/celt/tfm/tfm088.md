HODEKEN

>  

> ANOTHER Kobold or House-spirit took up his abode in the palace of the
> bishop of Hildesheim. He was named Hödeken or Hütchen, that is Hatekin
> or Little Hat, from his always wearing a little felt hat very much
> down upon his face. He was of a kind and obliging disposition, often
> told the bishop and others of what was to happen, and he took good
> care that the watchmen should not go to sleep on their post.

> It was, however, dangerous to affront him. One of the scullions in the
> bishop's kitchen used to fling dirt on him and splash him 'with foul
> water. Hödeken complained to the head cook, who only laughed at him,
> and said, "Are you a spirit and afraid of a little boy?" "Since you
> won't punish the boy," replied Hödeken, "I will, in a few days, let
> you see how much afraid of him I am," and he went off in high dudgeon.
> But very soon after he got the boy asleep at the fire-side, and he
> strangled him, cut him up, and put him into the pot on the fire. When
> the cook abused him for what he had done, he squeezed toads all over
> the meat that was at the fire, and he soon after tumbled the cook from
> the bridge into the deep moat. At last people grew so much afraid of
> his setting fire to the town and palace, that the bishop had him
> exorcised and banished.

> The following was one of Hödeken's principal exploits. There was a man
> in Hildesheim who had a light sort of wife, and one time when he was
> going on a journey he spoke to Hödeken and said, "My good fellow, just
> keep an eye on my wife while I am away, and see that all goes on
> right." Hödeken agreed to do so; and when the wife, after the
> departure of her husband, made her gallants come to her, and was going
> to make merry with them, Hödeken always threw himself in the middle
> and drove them away by assuming terrific forms; or, when any one had
> gone to bed, he invisibly flung him so roughly out on the floor as to
> crack his ribs. Thus they fared, one after another, as the
> light-o'-love dame introduced them into her chamber, so that no one
> ventured to come near her. At length, when the husband had returned
> home, the honest guardian of his honour presented himself before him
> full of joy, and said, "Your return is most grateful to me, that I may
> escape the trouble and disquiet that you had imposed upon me?" "Who
> are you, pray?" said the man. "I am Hödeken," replied he, "to whom, at
> your departure, you gave your wife in charge. To gratify you I have
> guarded her this time, and kept her from adultery, though with great
> and incessant toil. But I beg of you never more to commit her to my
> keeping; for I would sooner take charge of, and be accountable for,
> all the swine in Saxony than for one such woman, so many were the
> artifices and plots she devised to blink me."
