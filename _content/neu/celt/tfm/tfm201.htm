<BLOCKQUOTE>Written in Rome in the Spring of 1842.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>FAIR Tibur, once the Muses' home, <BR>
Before us lay; around<BR>
Was spread the plain which mighty Rome <BR>
Oft saw with victory crowned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The sun rode high, the sky was clear, <BR>
The lark poured forth his strain,<BR>
And flowers, the firstlings of the year, <BR>
Shed fragrance o'er the plain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A gentle lady turned on me<BR>
Her bright expressive eyes,<BR>
And bade the flame of poesy<BR>
Within my bosom rise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>'Twas then I felt, I felt, alas!<BR>
How Time has dealt with me,<BR>
And how the rays of fancy pass,<BR>
And vanish utterly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For time has been when such a view <BR>
And mandate of the fair,<BR>
With images of brightest hue,<BR>
Had fill'd the land and air:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While now I strive, and strive in vain, <BR>
To twine poetic flowers,<BR>
Since from me Time away has ta'en <BR>
Imagination's powers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then lady, be thou gentle still,<BR>
Let pity sway thy breast;<BR>
Accept for deeds the fervent will<BR>
To honour thy behest,</BLOCKQUOTE>
