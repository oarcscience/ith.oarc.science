NISSES \[a\]

>   
> Og Trolde, Hexer; Nisser i hver Vrase.  
> FINN MAGNUSSEN.

> And Witches, Trolls, and Nisses In each nook.

>  

> THE Nis is the same being that is called Kobold in Germany, Brownie in
> Scotland, and whom we shall meet in various other places under
> different appellations. He is in Denmark and Norway also called Nisse
> god-dreng *(Nissè good lad),* and in Sweden Tomtgubbe *(Old Man of the
> House),* or briefly Tomte.

> He is evidently of the Dwarf family, as he resembles them in
> appearance, and, like them, has the command of money, and the same
> dislike to noise and tumult. He is of the size of a year-old child,
> but has the face of an old man. His usual dress is grey, with a
> pointed red cap; but on Michael-mas-day he wears a round hat like
> those of the peasants.

> No farm-house goes on well unless there is a Nis in it, and well is it
> for the maids and the men when they are in favour with him. They may
> go to their beds and give themselves no trouble about their work, and
> yet in the morning the maids will find the kitchen swept up, and water
> brought; in, and the men will find the horses in the stable well
> cleaned and curried, and perhaps a supply of corn cribbed for them
> from the neighbours' barns. But he punishes them for any irregularity
> that takes place.

> The Nisses of Norway, we are told, are fond of the moonlight, and in
> the winter time they may be seen jumping over the yard, or driving in
> sledges. They are also skilled in music and dancing, and will, it is
> said, give instructions on the fiddle for a *grey sheep,* like the
> Swedish Strömkarl. \[b\]

> Every church, too, has its Nis, who looks to order, and chastises
> those who misbehave themselves. He is called the Kirkegrim.

> \[a\] Nisse, Grimm thinks (Deut. Mythol. p. 472) is Nicls, Niclsen,

> \[b\] Wilse *ap* Grimm, Deut. Mythol., p. 479, 'who thinks he may have
> confounded the Nis with the Nöck.
