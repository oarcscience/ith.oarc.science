THE STOLEN LADY

>   
> JOHN ROY, who lived in Glenbroun, in the parish of Abernethy, being
> out one night on the hills in search of his cattle, met a troop of
> fairies, who seemed to have got a prize of some sort or other.
> Recollecting that the fairies are obliged to exchange whatever they
> may have with any one who offers them anything, however low in value,
> for it, he flung his bonnet to them, crying *Shuis slo slumus sheen
> (i. e.,* mine is yours and yours is mine). The fairies dropped their
> booty, which proved to be a Sassenach (English) lady whom the dwellers
> of the Shian of Coir-laggac had carried away from her own country,
> leaving a stock in her place which, of course, died and was buried.
> John brought her home, and she lived for many years in his house. "It
> happened, however, in the course of time," said the Gaelic narrator,
> "that the *new king*; found it necessary to make the great roads
> through these countries by means of soldiers, for the purpose of
> letting coaches and carriages pass to the northern cities; and those
> soldiers had officers and commanders in the same way as our fighting
> army have now. Those soldiers were never great favourites m these
> countries, particularly during the time that our kings were alive; and
> consequently it was no easy matter for them, either officers or men,
> to procure for themselves comfortable quarters." But John Roy would
> not keep up the national animosity to the *cottan dearg*
> (red-coats),and he offered a residence in his house to a *Saxon*
> captain and his son. When there they could not take their eyes off the
> English lady, and the son remarked to his father what a strong
> likeness she bore to his deceased mother. The father replied that be
> too had been struck with the resemblance, and said he could almost
> fancy she *was* his wife. He then mentioned her name and those of some
> persons connected with them. The lady by these words at once
> recognised her husband and son, and honest John Roy had the
> satisfaction of reuniting the long-separated husband and wife, and
> receiving their most grateful acknowledgments. \[a\]

> \[a\] There is a similar legend in Scandinavia. As a smith was at work
> in his forge late one evening, he heard great wailing out on the road,
> and by the light of the red-hot iron that he was hammering, he saw a
> woman whom a Troll was driving along, bawling at her "A little more! a
> little more!" He ran out, put the red-hot iron between them, and thus
> delivered her from the power of the Troll. He led her into his house
> and that night she was delivered of twins, In the morning he waited on
> her husband, who lie supposed must be in great affliction at the loss
> of his wife. But to his surprise he saw there, in bed, a woman the
> very image of her he had saved from the Troll. Knowing at once what
> she must be, he raised an axe he had in his band, and cleft her skull.
> The matter was soon explained to the satisfaction of the husband, who
> gladly received his real wife and her twins.'.--. Thiele, i. 88.
