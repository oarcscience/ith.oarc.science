THE SOUL CAGES

>  

> JACK DOGHERTY lived on the coast of the county Clare. Jack was a
> fisherman, as his father and his grandfather before him had been. Like
> them, too, he lived all alone (but for the wife), and just in the same
> spot, too. People used to wonder why the Dogherty family were so fond
> of that wild situation, so far away from all human kind, and in the
> midst of huge scattered rocks, with nothing but the wide ocean to look
> upon. But they had their own good reasons for it.

> The place was just, in short, the only spot on that part of the coast
> where anybody could well live; there was a neat little creek, where a
> boat might lie as snug as a puffin in her nest, and out from this
> creek a ledge of sunken rocks ran into the sea. Now, when the
> Atlantic, according to custom, was raging with a storm, and a good
> westerly wind was blowing strong on the coast, many's the richly-laden
> ship that went to pieces on these rocks; and then the fine bales of
> cotton and tobacco, and such like things; and the pipes of wine, and
> the puncheons of rum, and the casks of brandy, and the kegs of
> Hollands that used to come ashore. Why, bless you! Dunbeg Bay was just
> like a little estate to the Doghertys.

> Not but that they were kind and humane to a distressed sailor, if ever
> one had the good luck to get to land; and many a time, indeed, did
> Jack put out in his little *corragh,* that would breast the billows
> like any gannet, to lend a hand towards bringing off the crew from a
> wreck. Bat when the ship was gone to pieces, and the crew were all
> lost, who would blame Jack for *picking* up all he could find? "And
> who's the worse of it?" said he. "For as to the king, God bless him!
> everybody knows he 'a rich enough already, without gettin' what 'a
> floatin' in the say."

> Jack, though such a hermit, was a good-natured, jolly fellow. No
> other, sure, could ever have coaxed Biddy Mahony to quit her father's
> snug and warm house in the middle of the town of Ennis, and to go so
> many miles off to live among the rocks, with the seals and sea-gulls
> for her next door neighbours. But Biddy knew what's what, and she knew
> that Jack was the man for a woman who wished to be comfortable and
> happy; for, to say nothing of the fish, Jack had the supplying of half
> the gentlemen's houses of the country with the Godsends that came into
> the bay. And she was right in her choice, for no woman ate, drank, or
> slept better, or made a prouder appearance at Chapel on Sundays than
> Mrs. Dogherty.

> Many a strange sight, it may well be supposed, did Jack see, and many
> a strange sound did he hear, but nothing daunted him. So far was he
> from being afraid of Merrows, or such like beings, that the very first
> wish of his heart was fairly to meet with one. Jack had heard that
> they were mighty like Christians, and that luck had always come out of
> an acquaintance with them. Never, therefore, did he dimly discern the
> Merrows moving along the face of the waters in their robes of mist,
> but he made direct for them; and many a scolding did Biddy, in her own
> quiet way, bestow upon Jack for spending his whole day out at sea, and
> bringing home no fish. Little did poor Biddy know the fish Jack was
> after.

> It was rather annoying to Jack that, though living in a place where
> the Merrows were as plenty as lobsters, he never could get a right
> view of one. What vexed him more was, that both his father and
> grandfather had often and often seen them; and he even remembered
> hearing, when a child, how his grandfather, who was the first of the
> family that had settled down at the Creek, had been so intimate with a
> Merrow, that, only for fear of vexing the priest, he would have had
> him stand for one of his children. This, however, Jack did not well
> know how to believe.

> Fortune at length began to think that it was only right that Jack
> should know as much as his father and grandfather knew. Accordingly,
> one day, when he had strolled a little farther than usual along the
> coast to the northward, just as he was turning a point, he saw
> something, like to nothing he had ever seen before, perched upon a
> rock at a little distance out to sea: it looked green in the body, as
> well as he could discern at that distance, and he would have sworn,
> only the thing was impossible, that it had a cocked hat in his hand.
> Jack stood, for a good half hour, straining his eyes and wondering at
> it, and all the time the thing did not stir hand or foot. At last
> Jack's patience was quite worn out, and he gave a loud whistle and a
> hail, when the Merrow (for such it was) started up, put the cocked hat
> on its head, and dived down, head foremost, from the rock.

> Jack's curiosity was now excited, and he constantly directed his steps
> toward the point; still he could never get a glimpse of the
> sea-gentleman with the cocked hat; and with thinking and thinking
> about the matter, he began at last to fancy he had been only dreaming.
> One very rough day, however, when the sea was running mountains high,
> Jack determined to give a look at the Merrow's rock, (for he had
> always chosen a fine day before,) and then he saw the strange thing
> cutting capers upon the top of the rock, and then diving down, and
> then coming up, and then diving down again. Jack had now only to
> choose his time, (that is, a good blowing day,) and he might see the
> man of the sea as often as he pleased. All this, however, did not
> satisfy him,--"much will have more;"--he wished now to get acquainted
> with the Merrow, and even in this he succeeded. One tremendous
> blustery day, before he got to the point whence he had a- view of the
> Merrow's rock, the storm came on so furiously that Jack was obliged to
> take shelter in one of the caves which are so numerous along the
> coast, and there, to his astonishment, he saw, sitting before him, a
> thing with green hair, long green teeth, a red nose, and pig's eyes.
> It had a fish's tail, legs with scales on them, and short arms like
> fins. It wore no clothes, but had the cocked hat under its arm, and
> seemed engaged thinking very seriously about something. Jack, with all
> his courage, was a little daunted; but now or never, thought he; so up
> he went boldly to the cogitating fish-man, took off his hat, and made
> his best bow.

> "Your sarvint, sir," said Jack.--"Your servant, kindly, Jack
> Dogherty," answered the Merrow.--"To be shure, thin, how well your
> honour knows my name," said Jack.--"Is it I not know your name, Jack
> Dogherty? Why, man, I knew your grandfather long before he was married
> to Judy Began, your grandmother. Ah, Jack, Jack, I was fond of that
> grandfather of yours; he was a mighty worthy man in his time. I never
> met his match above or below, before or since, for sucking in a
> shellful of brandy. I hope, my boy," said the old fellow, "I hope you
> 're his own grandson."--"Never fear me for that," said Jack; "if my
> mother only reared me on brandy, 'tis myself that 'ud be a suckin
> infant to this hour."--"Well, I like to hear you talk so manly; you
> and I must be better acquainted, if it were only for your
> grandfather's sake. But, Jack, that father of yours was not the thing;
> he had no head at all, not he."--"I'm shure," said Jack, "sense your
> honour lives down undher the wather, you must be obleeged to dhrink a
> power to keep any hate in you, at all at all, in such a cruel, damp,
> cowld place. Well, I often hard of Christhens dhrinkin' like
> fishes;--and might I be so bould as to ax where you get the
> sperits?"--"Where do you get them yourself Jack?" said the Merrow,
> with a knowing look.--"Hubbubboo," cries Jack, "now I see how it is;
> but I suppose, sir, your honour has got a fine dhry cellar below to
> keep them in."--"Let me alone for that," said the Merrow, with another
> knowing look.--"I'm shure," continued Jack, "it must be mighty well
> worth the luking at."--"You may say that, Jack, with your own pretty
> mouth," said the Merrow; "and if you meet me here next Monday, just at
> this time of the day, we will have a little more talk with one another
> about the matter."

> Jack and the Merrow parted the beat friends in the world; and on
> Monday they met, and Jack was not a little surprised to see that the
> Merrow had two cocked hats with him, one under each arm. "Might I make
> so bould as to ask you, sir," said Jack, "why yer honour brought the
> two hats wid you to-day? You wouldn't, shure, be goin' to giv' me one
> o' them, to keep for the curosity of the thing?"--"No, no, Jack," said
> he, "I don't get my hats so easily, to part with them that way; but I
> want you to come down and eat a bit of dinner with me, and I brought
> you the hat to dive with."--"The Lord bless and presarve us cried
> Jack, in amazement, "would you want me to go down to the bottom of the
> salt say ocean? Shure I'd be smoothered and choked up wid the wather,
> to say nothin' of bein' dhrownded! And what would poor Biddy do for
> me, and what would she say?"--"And what matter what she says, you
> pinkeen you? Who cares for Biddy's squalling? It 'a long before your
> grandfather would have talked in that way. Many's the time he stuck
> that same hat on his head, and dived down boldly after me, and many's
> the snug bit of dinner, and good shellful of brandy, he and I had
> together, below under the water."--"Is it really, sir, and no joke?"
> said Jack; "why, thin, sorra' be from me for ivir and a day afther, if
> I'll be a bit a worse man nor my grandfather was! So here goes; but
> play me fair now. Here 's nick or nothin'!" cried Jack.--"That 's your
> grandfather all over," said the old fellow. "So come along, my boy,
> and do as I do."

> They both left the cave, walked into the sea, and then swam a piece
> until they got to the rock. The Merrow climbed to the top of it, and
> Jack followed him, On the far side it was as straight as the wall of a
> house, and the sea looked so deep that Jack was almost cowed.

> "Now, do you see, Jack," said the Merrow, "just put this hat on your
> head, and mind to keep your eyes wide open. Take hold of my tail, and
> follow after me, and you'II see what you'll see." In he dashed, and in
> dashed Jack after him boldly. They went and they went, and Jack
> thought they'd never stop going. Many a time did he wish himself
> sitting at home by the fireside with Biddy: yet, where was the use of
> wishing now, when he was so many miles as he thought below the waves
> of the Atlantic? Still he held hard by the Merrow's tail, slippery as
> it was. And, at last, to Jack's great surprise, they got out of the
> water, and he actually found himself on dry land at the bottom of the
> sea. They landed just in front of a nice little house that was slated
> very neatly with oyster-shells; and the Merrow, turning about to Jack,
> welcomed him down. Jack could hardly speak, what with wonder, and what
> with being out of breath with travelling so fast through the water. He
> looked about him, and could see no living things, barring crabs and
> lobsters, of which there were plenty walking leisurely about on the
> sand. Overhead was the sea like a sky, and the fishes like birds
> swimming about in it.

> "Why don't you speak, man?" said the Merrow: "I dare say you had no
> notion that I had such a snug little concern as this? Are you
> smothered, or choked, or drowned, or are you fretting after Biddy,
> eh?" "Oh! not mysilf indeed," said Jack, showing his teeth with a
> good-humoured grin, "but who in the world 'ud ivir ha' thought uv
> seem' sich a thing?" "Well, come along my lad, and let's see what
> they've got for us to eat?"

> Jack was really hungry, and it gave him no small pleasure to perceive
> a fine column of smoke rising from the chimney, announcing what was
> going on within. Into the house he followed the Merrow, and there he
> saw a good kitchen, right well provided with everything. There was a
> noble dresser, and plenty of pots and pans, with two young Merrows
> cooking. His host then led him into the *room,* which was furnished
> shabbily enough. Not a table or a chair was there in it; nothing but
> planks and logs of wood to sit on, and eat off. There was, however, a
> good fire blazing on the hearth--a comfortable sight to Jack. "Come,
> now, and I 'II show you where I keep--you know what," said the Merrow,
> with a sly look; and opening a little door, he led Jack into a fine
> long cellar, well filled with pipes, and kegs, and hogsheads, and
> barrels. "What do you say to that, Jack Dogherty?--Eh!--May-be a body
> can't live snug down under the water!" "The divil the doubt of that,"
> said Jack, "anyhow."

> They went back to the room, and found dinner laid. There was no
> table-cloth, to be sure--but what matter? It was not always Jack had
> one at home. The dinner would have been no discredit to the first
> house in the county on a fast-day. The choicest of fish, and no
> wonder, was there. Turbots, and soles, and lobsters, and oysters, and
> twenty other--kinds, were on the planks at once, and plenty of foreign
> spirits. The wines, the old fellow said, were too cold for his
> stomach. Jack ate and drank till he could eat no more: then, taking up
> a shell of brandy, "Here's to your honour's good health, sir," said
> he, "though beggin' your pardon, its mighty odd, that as long as we're
> acquainted, I don't know, your name yit." "That 's true, Jack,"
> replied he; "I never thought of it before, but better late than never.
> My name is Coomara." "Coomara! And a mighty dacint sort of a name it
> is, too," cried Jack, taking another shellful: "here 's, then, to your
> good health, Coomara, and may you live these fifty years." "Fifty
> years!" repeated Coomara; "I 'm obliged to you, indeed; if you had
> said five hundred, it would have been something worth wishing." "By
> the laws, sir," said Jack, "yez live to a powerful great age here
> undlier the wather! Ye knew my grandfather, and he 'a dead and gone
> betther nor sixty years. I 'm shure it must be a mighty healthy place
> to live in." "No doubt of it; but come, Jack, keep the liquor
> stirring."

> Shell after shell did they empty, and to Jack's exceeding surprise, he
> found the drink never got into his head, owing, I suppose, to the sea
> being over them, which kept their noddles cool. Old Coomara got
> exceedingly comfortable, and sang several songs; but Jack, if his life
> had depended on it, never could remember any of them. At length said
> he to Jack, "Now, my dear boy, if you follow me, I 'll show you my
> curiosities!" He opened a little door, and led Jack into a large room,
> where Jack saw a great many odds and ends that Coomara had picked up
> at one time or another. What chiefly took his attention, however, were
> things like lobster-pots, ranged on the ground along the wall.

> "Well, Jack, how do you like my curiosities?" said old Coo. "Upon my
> sowkins, sir," said Jack, "they 're mighty well worth the lukin' at;
> but might a body make so bould as to ax what thim things like
> lobster-pots are?" "Oh, the soul-cages, is it?" "The what, sir?"
> "These things here that I keep the souls in." "Arrah! what sowls, sir?
> " said Jack in amazement: "shure the fish ha' got no sowls in them?"
> "Oh, no," replied Coo, quite coolly, "that they haven't; but these are
> the souls of drowned sailors." "The Lord presarve us from all harm!"
> muttered Jack," how in the world did you conthrive to get thim?"
> "Easily enough. I've only when I see a good storm coming on, to set a
> couple of dozen of these, and then, when the sailors are drowned, and
> the souls get out of them under the water, the poor things are almost
> perished to death, not being used to the cold; so they make into my
> pots for shelter, and then I have them snug, and fetch them home, and
> keep them here dry and warm; and is it not well for them, poor souls,
> to get into such good quarters?"

> Jack was so thunderstruck he did not know what to say, so he said
> nothing. They went back into the dining-room, and had some more
> brandy, which was excellent, and then, as Jack knew that it must be
> getting late, and as Biddy might be uneasy, he stood up, and said he
> thought it was time for him to be on the road.

> "Just as you like, Jack," said Coo, "but take a *doch an durrus*
> before you go; you've a cold journey before you." Jack knew better
> manners than to refuse the parting glass. "I wondher" said he, "will I
> ivir be able to make out my way home." "What should all you," said
> Coo, "when I show you the way?" Out they went before the house, and
> Coomara took one of the cocked hats, and put it on Jack's head the
> wrong way, and then lifted him up on his shoulder that he might launch
> him up into the water. "Now," says he, giving him a heave, "you 'll
> come up just in the same spot yon came down in; and, Jack, mind and
> throw me back the hat." He canted Jack off his shoulder, and up he
> shot like a bubble--whirr, whirr, whiz--away he went up through the
> water, till he came to the very rock he had jumped off where he found
> a landing-place, and then in he threw the hat, which sunk like a
> stone.

> The sun was just going down in the beautiful sky of a calm summer's
> evening. The evening star was seen brightly twinkling in the cloudless
> heaven, and the waves of the Atlantic flashed in a golden flood of
> light. So Jack, perceiving it was getting late, set off home; but when
> he got there, not a word did he say to Biddy of where he had spent his
> day.

> The state of the poor souls cooped up in the lobster-pots, gave Jack a
> great deal of trouble, and how to release them cost him a great deal
> of thought. He at first had a mind to speak to the priest about the
> matter; but what could the priest do, and what did Coo care for the
> priest? Besides, Coo was a good sort of an old fellow, and did not
> think he was doing any harm. Jack had a regard for him too, and it
> also might not be much to his own credit if it were known that he used
> to go dine with the Merrows under the sea. On the whole, he thought
> his best plan would be to ask Coo to dinner, and to make him drunk, if
> he was able, and then to take the hat and go down and turn up the
> pots. It was first of all necessary, however, to get Biddy out of the
> way; for Jack was prudent enough, as she was a woman, to wish to keep
> the thing secret from her.

> Accordingly, Jack grew mighty pious all of a sudden, and said to
> Biddy, that he thought it would be for the good of both their souls if
> she was to go and take her rounds at Saint John's Well, near Ennis.
> Biddy thought so too, and accordingly off she set one fine morning at
> day dawn, giving Jack a strict charge to have an eye to the place. The
> coast being clear, away then went Jack to the rock to give the
> appointed signal to Coomara, which was, throwing a big stone into the
> water; Jack threw, and up sprang Coo. "Good morrow, Jack," said he;
> "what do you want with me?" "Jist nothin' at all to spake about, sir,"
> replied Jack; "only to come and take pot-luck wid me, now that Biddy's
> out of the way; if I might make so free as to ax you, an' shure it 's
> myself that's afther doin' so." "It's quite agreeable, Jack, I assure
> you; what 's your hour?" "Any time that 's most convanient to
> yoursilf, sir: say one o'clock, that you may go home, if you wish it,
> wid the daylight." "I'll be with you," said Coo, "never fear me."

> Jack went home and dressed a noble fish dinner, and got out plenty of
> his best foreign spirits, enough for that matter to make twenty men
> drunk. Just to the minute came Coo, with his cocked hat under his arm.
> Dinner was ready; they sat down, and ate and drank manfully. Jack
> thinking of the poor souls below in the pots, plied old Coo well with
> brandy, and encouraged him to sing, hoping to put him under the table,
> but poor Jack forgot that he had not the sea over his own head now to
> keep it cool. The brandy got into it and did his business for him, and
> Coo reeled off home, leaving his entertainer as dumb as a haddock on a
> Good Friday.

> Jack never woke till the next morning, and then he was in a sad way.
> "Tis no use at all for me thinkin' to make that ould Rapperee dhrunk,"
> said Jack; "an' how in this world can I help the poor sowis out o' the
> lobster pots." After ruminatin nearly the whole day, a thought struck
> him. "I have it," said he, slapping his thigh; "I'll be bail Coo nivir
> saw a dhrop o' raal potyeen as ould as he is, an' that's the thing to
> settle him! Och! thin isn't it well that Biddy won't be home these two
> days yit; I can have another twist at him." Jack asked Coo again, and
> Coo laughed at him for having no better head; telling him, he 'd never
> come up to his grandfather. "Well, but thry me agin," said Jack, "and
> I'll be bail to dhrink you dhrunk and sober and dhrunk agin."--"Any
> thing in my power," said Coo, "to oblige you."

> All this dinner, Jack took care to have his own liquor watered, and to
> give the strongest brandy he had to Coo. At last, says he, "Pray, sir,
> did you ivir dhrink any potyeen? any raal mountain-jew?"--"No," says
> Coo; what 's that, and where does it come from?"--"Oh! that 's a
> sacret," said Jack, "but it 'a the right stuff; nivir believe me agin
> if it isn't fifty times better nor brandy or rum either. Biddy's
> brother jist sint me a present of a little dhrop, in exchange for some
> brandy and as you're an ould frind o' the family, I kep it to thrate
> you wid."--"Well, let 'a see what sort of thing it is," said Coo.

> The potyeen was the right sort, it was first-rate, and had the real
> smack on it. Coo was delighted with it; he drank and he sang, and he
> laughed and he danced, till he fell on the floor fast asleep. Then
> Jack, who had taken good care to keep himself sober, snapt up the
> cocked hat, ran off to the rock, leaped in, and soon arrived at Coo's
> habitation.

> All was as still as a churchyard at midnight--not a Merrow young or
> old, was there. In he went and turned up the pots, but nothing did he
> see, only he heard, he thought, a sort of a little whistle or chirp as
> he raised each of them. At this he was surprised, till he recollected
> what the priest had often said. that nobody living could see the soul,
> no more than they could see the wind or the air. Having now done all
> he could do for them he set the pots as they were before, and sent a
> blessing after the poor souls to speed them on their journey wherever
> they were going. He now began to think of returning; he put on the hat
> (as was right,) the wrong way; but 'when he got out, he found the
> water so high over his head that he had no hopes of ever getting up
> into it now that he had not old Coomara to give him a lift. He walked
> about looking for a ladder, but not one could he find, and not a rock
> was there in sight. At last he saw a spot where the sea hung rather
> lower than anywhere else, so he resolved to try there. Just as he came
> to it, a big cod happened to put down his tail. Jack made a jump and
> caught hold of it, and the cod, all in amazement, gave a bounce and
> pulled Jack up. The minute the hat touched the water, pop away Jack
> was whisked; and up he shot like a cork, dragging the poor cod, that
> he forgot to let go, up with him tail foremost. He got to the rock in
> no time, and without a moment's delay hurried home rejoicing in the
> good deed he had done. But, meanwhile, there was fine work at home;
> for our friend Jack had hardly left the house on his soul-freeing
> expedition, when back came Biddy from her soul-saving one to the well.
> When she entered the house and saw the things lying *thrie-na heelah*
> on the table before her--" Here 's a purty job," said she, "that
> blackguard of mine--what ill luck I had ivir to marry him--he's picked
> up some vagabone or other, while I was prayin' for the good of his
> sowl; and they've bin dhrinkin' up all the potyeen that my own brother
> gev' him, and all the sperits, to be shure, that he was to have sould

> Well, well, well to be shure, I often hard till of a man makin' a

> hone,--.Jack, honey, what 'ill I do wid you, or what 'ill I do widout

> half a mind to be angry with him for not telling her before, owned
> that he had done a great service to the poor souls. Back they both
> went most lovingly to the house, and Jack wakened up Coomara; and
> perceiving the old fellow to be rather dull, he bid him not be cast
> down, for 'twas many a good man's case; said it all came of his not
> being used to the potyeen, and recommended him, by way of cure, to

> he had had quite enough: he got up, quite out of sorts, and without
> having the good manners to say one word in the way of civility, he
> sneaked off to cool himself by a jaunt through the salt water.

> Coomara never missed the souls. He and Jack continued the best friends
> in the world; and no one, perhaps, ever equalled Jack at freeing souls
> from purgatory; for he contrived fifty excuses for getting into the
> house below the sea, unknown to the old fellow; and then turned up the
> pots, and let out the souls. It vexed him, to be sure, that he could
> never see them; but as he knew the thing to be impossible, he was
> obliged to be satisfied. Their intercourse continued for several
> years. However, one morning, on Jack's throwing in a stone, as usual,
> he got no answer. He flung another, and another; still there was no
> reply. He went away, and returned the next morning; but it was to no
> purpose. As he was without the hat, he could not go down to see what
> had become of old Coo; but his belief was, that the old man, or the
> old fish, or whatever he was, had either died, or had removed away
> from that part of the country.\*
