DEPARTURE OF THE TROLLS FROM VENDSYSSEL

>  

> ONE evening, after sunset, there came a strange man to the ferry of
> Sund. He engaged all the ferry-boats there to go backwards and
> forwards the whole night long between that place and Vendsyssel,
> without the people's knowing what lading they had. He told them that
> they should take their freight on board half a mile to the east of
> Sund, near the alehouse at the bridge of Lange.

> At the appointed time the man was at that place, and the ferrymen,
> though unable to see anything, perceived very clearly that the boats
> sunk deeper and deeper, so that they easily concluded that they had
> gotten a very heavy freight on board. The ferry-boats passed in this
> manner to and fro the whole night long; and though they got every trip
> a fresh cargo, the strange man never left them, but staid to have
> everything regulated by his directions.

> When morning was breaking they received the payment they had agreed
> for, and they then ventured to inquire what it was they had been
> bringing over, but on that head their employer would give them no
> satisfaction.

> But there happened to be among the ferrymen a smart fellow who knew
> more about these matters than the others. He jumped on shore, took the
> clay from under his right foot, and put it into his cap, and when he
> had set it on his head he perceived that all the sand-hills east of
> Aalborg were completely covered with little Troll-people, who had all
> pointed red caps on their heads. Ever since that time there have been
> no Dwarfs seen in Vendsyssel. \[a\]
