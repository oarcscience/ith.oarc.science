ISLE OF RUGEN

>  

> Des Tagscheins Blendung driickt,  
> Nur Finsternise beglückt;  
> Drum hausen wir so gem  
> Tief in des Erdballs Kern.  
> MATTHISON.

> Day's dazzling light annoys  
> Us, darkness only joys;  
> We therefore love to dwell  
> Deep underneath earth's shell.

>  

> WE now return to the Baltic, to the Isle of Rügen, once a chief seat
> of the Vendish religion; but it's priests were massacred by the
> Scandinavians, and all traces of their system effaced. Its fairy
> mythology now agrees with that of its Gothic neighbours, and Mr.
> Arndt, \[a\] a native of the island, has enabled us to give the
> following tolerably full account of it:-

> The inhabitants of Rügen believe in three kinds of Dwarfs, or
> underground people, the White, the Brown, and the Black; so named from
> the colour of their several habiliments.

> The White are the most delicate and beautiful of all, and are of an
> innocent and gentle disposition. During the winter, when the face of
> nature is cold, raw, and cheerless, they remain still and quiet in
> their hills, solely engaged in the fashioning of the finest works in
> silver and gold, of too delicate a texture for mortal eyes to discern.
> Thus they pass the winter; but no sooner does the spring return than
> they abandon their recesses, and live through all the summer above
> ground, in sunshine and starlight, in uninterrupted revelry and
> enjoyment. The moment the trees and flowers begin to sprout and bud in
> the early days of spring, they emerge from their bills, and get among
> the stalks and branches, and thence to the blossoms and flowers, where
> they sit and gaze around them. In the night, when mortals sleep, the
> White Dwarfs come forth, and dance their joyous roundels in the green
> grass, about the hills, and brooks, and springs, making the sweetest
> and most delicate music, bewildering travellers, who hear and wonder
> at the strains of the invisible musicians. They may, if they will, go
> out by day, but never in company; these daylight rambles being allowed
> them only when alone and under some assumed form. They therefore
> frequently fly about in the shape of party-coloured little birds, or
> butterflies, or snow-white doves, showing kindness and benevolence to
> the good who merit their favour.

> The Brown Dwarfs, the next in order, are less than eighteen inches
> high. They wear little brown coats and jackets, and a brown cap on
> their head, with a little silver bell in it. Some of them wear black
> shoes with red strings in them; in general, however, they wear fine
> glass ones; at their dances none of them wear any other. They are very
> handsome in their persons, with clear light-coloured eyes, and small
> and most beautiful hands and feet. They are on the whole of a
> cheerful, good-natured disposition, mingled with some roguish traits.
> Like the White Dwarfs, they are great artists in gold and silver,
> working so curiously as to astonish those who happen to see their
> performances. At night they come out of their hills and dance by the
> light of the moon and stars. They also glide invisibly into people's
> houses, their caps rendering them imperceptible by all who have not
> similar caps. They are said to play all kinds of tricks, to change the
> children in the cradles, and take them away. This charge is perhaps
> unfounded, but certainly, children who fail into their hands must
> serve them for fifty years. They possess an unlimited power of
> transformation, and can pass through the smallest keyholes. Frequently
> they bring with them presents for children, or lay gold rings and
> ducats, and the like, in their way, and often are invisibly present,
> and save them from the perils of fire and water. They plague and annoy
> lazy men-servants and untidy maids with frightful dreams; oppress them
> as the nightmare; bite them as fleas; and scratch and tear them like
> cats and dogs; and often in the night frighten, in the shape of owls,
> thieves and lovers, or, like Will-'o-the-wisps, lead them astray into
> bogs and marshes, and perhaps up to those who are in pursuit of them.

> The Black Dwarfs wear black jackets and caps, are not handsome like
> the others, but on the contrary are horridly ugly, with weeping eyes,
> like blacksmiths and colliers. They are most expert workmen,
> especially in steel, to which the can give a degree at once of
> hardness and flexibility wine no human smith can imitate; for the
> swords they make will bend like rushes, and are as hard as diamonds.
> In old times arms and armour made by them were in great request:
> shirts of mail manufactured by them were as fine as cobwebs, and yet
> no bullet would penetrate them, and no helm or corslet could resist
> the swords they fashioned; but all these things are now gone out of
> use.

> These Dwarfs are of a malicious, ill disposition, and delight in doing
> mischief to mankind; they are unsocial, and there are seldom more than
> two or three of them seen together; they keep mostly in their hills,
> and seldom come out in the daytime, nor do they ever go far from home.
> People say that in the summer they are fond of sitting under the elder
> trees, the smell of which is very grateful to them, and that any one
> that wants anything of them must go there and call them. Some say they
> have no music and dancing, only howling and whimpering; and that when
> a screaming is heard in the woods and marshes, like that of crying
> children, and a mewing and screeching like that of a multitude of cats
> or owls, the sounds proceed from their midnight assemblies, and are
> made by the vociferous Dwarfs.

> The principal residence of the two first classes of the
> underground-people in Rügen is what are called the Nine-hills, near
> Rambin. These hills lie on the west point of the island, about a
> quarter of a mile from the village of Rambin in the open country. They
> are small mounds, or Giants' graves (*Hünengräber*), as such are
> called, and are the subject of many a tale and legend among the
> people. The account of their origin is as follows:-

> "A long, long time ago there lived in Rügen a mighty Giant named
> Balderich. He was vexed that the country was an island, and that he
> had always to wade through the sea when he wanted to go to Pomerania
> and the main land. He accordingly got an immense apron made, and he
> tied it round his waist and filled it with earth, for he wanted to
> make a dam of earth for himself from the island to the mainland. As he
> was going with his load over Rodenkirchen, a hole tore in the apron,
> and the clay that fell out formed the Nine-hills. He stopped the hole
> and went on; but when he he had gotten to Gustau, another hole tore in
> the apron, and thirteen little hills fell out. He proceeded to the sea
> with what he had now remaining, and pouring the earth into the waters,
> formed the hook of Prosnitz, and the pretty little peninsula of
> Drigge. But there still remained a small space between Rügen and
> Pomerania, which so incensed the Giant that he fell down in a fit and
> died, from which unfortunate accident his dam was never finished."
> \[b\]

> A Giant-maiden commenced a similar operation on the Pomeranian side
> "in order," said she, "that I may be able to go over the bit of water
> without wetting my little slippers." So she filled her apron with sand
> and hurried down to the sea-side. But there was a hole in the apron
> and just behind Sagard a part of the sand ran out and formed a little
> hill named Dubbleworth. "Ah!" said she, "now my mother will scold me."
> She stopped the hole with her hand and ran on as fast as she could.
> But her mother looked over the wood and cried, "You nasty child, what
> are you about? Come here and you shall get a good whipping." The
> daughter in a fright let go the apron, and all the sand ran out and
> formed the barren hifis near Litzow. \[c\]

> The Dwarfs took up their abode in the Nine-hills. The White ones own
> two of them, and the Brown ones seven, for there are no Black ones
> there. These dwell chiefly on the coast-hills, along the shore between
> the Ahlbeck and Mönchgut, where they hold their assemblies, and
> plunder the ships that are wrecked on the coast.

> The Neck is called in Rügen Nickel. Some fishers once launched their
> boat on a lonely lake. Next day when they came they saw it in a high
> beech-tree. "Who the devil has put the boat in the tree?" cried one. A
> voice replied, but they saw no one, "'Twas no devil at all, but I and
> my brother Nickel." \[d\]

> The following stories Mr. Arndt, who, as we have observed, is a native
> of Rügen, says he heard in his boyhood from Hinrich Vieck, the
> Statthalter or Bailiff of Grabitz, who abounded in these legends; "so
> that it is, properly speaking," says he, "Hinrich Vieck, and not I,
> that relates." We therefore see no reason to doubt of their
> genuineness, though they may be a little embellished. \[e\]
