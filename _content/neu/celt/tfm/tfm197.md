ALEXANDER SELKIRK'S DREAM

COMPOSED ONE DAY WHEN CONFINED TO BED BY A COLD  
AND UNABLE TO READ

>  

> O'ER the isle of Juan Fernandez  
> Cooling shades of evening spread,  
> While upon the peaks of Andes  
> Still the tints of day were shed.

> From the sea-beat shore returning  
> Homeward hied the lonely man,  
> O'er his cheerless fortune mourning,  
> As through past days memory ran.

> Soon his brief repast was ended  
> And he sought his lowly bed;  
> Balmy slumber there descended,  
> Shedding influence o'er his head.

> Then a vision full of gladness  
> Came, sent forth by Him supreme,  
> Who his suffering servants' sadness  
> Oft dispelleth in a dream.

> \*

> In his view the lively dream sets  
> Hills and vales in verdure bright;  
> Where the gaily-prattling streamlets  
> Sparkle in the morning-light.

> Hark! the holy bell is swinging,  
> Calling to the house of prayer;  
> Loud resounds the solemn ringing  
> Through the still and balmy air.

> Youths and maids from glen and mountain  
> Hasten at the hallowed sound,  
> Old men rest by shady fountain,  
> Children lay them on the ground.

> Now the pious throng is streaming  
> Through the temple's portal low;  
> Rapture in each face is beaming  
> Pure devotion's genuine glow.

> Fervently the hoary pastor,  
> Humbly bent before his God,  
> Supplicates their heavenly Master  
> Them to lead on Sion's road;

> Owns that all have widely erred  
> From the true, the narrow way,  
> That with Him we have no merit,  
> And no claim of right can lay.

> Loud then rise in choral measure  
> Hymns of gratitude and praise,  
> As, inspired with solemn pleasure,  
> Unto Heaven their strains they raise.

> Now the grave discourse beginneth,  
> Which, ungraced by rhetoric's arts,  
> Quick the rapt attention winneth,  
> While it glorious truths imparts;

> While it tells how kind is Heaven  
> To the race of him who fell;  
> How of old the Son was given  
> To redeem from pains of hell;

> How the Holy Spirit abideth  
> In their hearts that hear his call;  
> How our God for all provideth,  
> How His mercy's over all;

> How, beyond the grave extending,  
> Regions lie of endless bliss;  
> How our thoughts on that world bending,  
> We should careless be of this.

> Once again the raised hymn pealeth  
> Notes of joy and jubilee,  
> Praising Him who truth revealeth,  
> Dweller of Eternity!

> \*

> Night's dim shades were now retreating,  
> Over Andes rose the day  
> On the hills the kids' loud bleating  
> Lingering slumber chased away.

> Birds their merry notes were singing,  
> Joyous at the approach of morn--  
> Morn that, light and fragrance flinging,  
> Earth doth cherish and adorn.

> Waked by Nature's general chorus  
> Selkirk quits his lonely couch,  
> While o'er heaven run colours glorious,  
> Heralding the sun's approach.

> Still the vision hovers o'er him,  
> Still the heavenly strains he hears,  
> Setting those bright realms before him  
> Where are wiped away all tears.

> All this vain and transitory  
> State of mankind here on earth,  
> Weighed with that exceeding glory,  
> Now he deems as nothing worth.

> Low he bends in adoration,  
> As the sun ascends the sky;  
> Doubt and fear and lamentation  
> With the night's last shadows fly.
