(ELLEN MY LOVE)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CARROL O'DALY is the Lochinvar of Ireland. He and Ellen Cavanagh were intimate from childhood. The result was love; but Ellen's father insisted on her marrying a wealthier suitor. On the wedding-night Carrol came disguised as a harper, and played and sung this air, which he had composed for the occasion. Ellen's tenderness revived in full force; she contrived to make her father, the bridegroom, and the guests drink to excess, and by morning she and Carrel were beyond pursuit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The following lines were written one evening to gratify a lady who wished to have the writer's idea of what Carrol might have sung. The air is generally known under the name of Robin Adair--</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>What are the joys wealth and honours bestow?<BR>
Do they endure like true love's steady glow? <BR>
Shadows of vanity, <BR>
Mists of the summer sky, <BR>
Soon they disperse and <I>fly,<BR>
</I>Aileen a roon!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Time was when Aileen tripped light as the fawn,<BR>
Spying young Carrol approach in the dawn, <BR>
Ere the sun's early beam <BR>
Glittered on lake and stream,--<BR>
Oh! that was bliss supreme,<BR>
Aileen a roon!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Or when mild even's star beamed in the west, <BR>
Bringing to nature the season of rest--<BR>
At that sweet hour to rove, <BR>
Down by yon spreading grove, <BR>
Breathing forth vows of love,<BR>
Aileen a roon!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Aileen forgets, but her Carrol more true,<BR>
As these past scenes memory brings to his view. <BR>
Heaves many a heavy sigh, <BR>
Breaking his heart is nigh--<BR>
And canst thou let him die?<BR>
Aileen a roon!</BLOCKQUOTE>
