<P ALIGN="CENTER">SIR THYNNE.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>AND it was the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
He was a knight so grave;<BR>
Whether he were on foot or on horse,<BR>
He was a knight so brave. [a]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;<BR>
Went the hart and the hind to shoot,<BR>
So he saw Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<BR>
At the green linden's foot.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<BR>
Unto her handmaid she cried,<BR>
"Go fetch my gold harp hither to me,<BR>
Sir Thynn&egrave; I'll draw to my side."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first stroke on her gold harp she struck,<BR>
So sweetly she made it ring,<BR>
The wild beasts in the wood and field<BR>
They forgot whither they would spring.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The next stroke on her gold harp she struck, <BR>
So sweetly she made it ring,<BR>
The little gray hawk that sat on the bough, <BR>
He spread out both his wings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The third stroke on her gold harp she struck,<BR>
So sweetly she made it ring,<BR>
The little fish that went in the stream,<BR>
He forgot whither he would swim.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then flowered the mead, then leafed all,<BR>
'Twas caused by the runic lay; [b]<BR>
Sir Thynn&egrave; he struck his spurs in his horse,<BR>
He no longer could hold him away.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
From his horse he springs hastily,<BR>
So goeth he to Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<BR>
All under the green linden tree.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Here you sit, my maiden fair,<BR>
A rose all lilies above;<BR>
See you can never a mortal man<BR>
Who will not seek your love."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Be silent, be silent, now Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
With your proffers of love, I pray;<BR>
For I am betrothed unto a hill-king,<BR>
A king all the Dwarfs obey.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"My true love he sitteth the bill within,<BR>
And at gold tables plays merrily;<BR>
My father he setteth his champions in ring,<BR>
And in iron arrayeth them he.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"My mother she sitteth the hill within,<BR>
And gold in the chest doth lay;<BR>
And I stole out for a little while,<BR>
Upon my gold harp to play."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
He patted her cheek rosie:<BR>
"Why wilt thou not give a kinder reply:<BR>
Thou dearest of maidens, to me?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I can give you no kinder reply;<BR>
I may not myself that allow;<BR>
I am betrothed to a hill-king,<BR>
And to him I must keep my vow."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<BR>
She at the hill-door looked out,<BR>
And there she saw how the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
Lay at the green linden's foot.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<BR>
She was vext and angry, God wot:<BR>
"What hast thou here in the grove to do?<BR>
Little business, I trow, thou hast got.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"'Twere better for thee in the hill to be,<BR>
And gold in the chest to lay,<BR>
Than here to sit in the rosy grove, [c]<BR>
And on thy gold harp to play.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And 'twere better for thee in the hill to be,<BR>
And thy bride-dress finish sewing,<BR>
Than sit under the lind, and with runic lay<BR>
A Christian man's heart to thee win."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<BR>
She goeth in at the hill-door:<BR>
And after her goeth the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
Clothed in scarlet and fur.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<BR>
Forth a red-gold chair she drew:<BR>
Then she cast Sir Thynn&egrave; into a sleep<BR>
Until that the cock he crew.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,<BR>
The five rune-books she took out;<BR>
So she loosed him fully out of the runes,<BR>
Her daughter had bound him about.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And hear thou me, Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
From the runes thou now art free;<BR>
This to thee I will soothly say,<BR>
My daughter shall never win thee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And I was born of Christian kind,<BR>
And to the hill stolen in;<BR>
My sister dwelleth in Iseland, [d]<BR>
And wears a gold crown so fine.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And there she wears her crown of gold,<BR>
And beareth of queen the name;<BR>
Her daughter was stolen away from her,<BR>
Thereof there goeth great fame.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Her daughter was stolen away from her,<BR>
And to Berner-land brought in;<BR>
And there now dwelleth the maiden free,<BR>
She is called Lady Hermolin.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And never can she into the dance go,<BR>
But seven women follow her;<BR>
And never can she on the gold-harp play,<BR>
If the queen herself is not there.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The king he hath a sister's son,<BR>
He hopeth the crown to possess,<BR>
For him they intend the maiden free,<BR>
For her little happiness.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And this for my honour will I do<BR>
And out of good-will moreover,<BR>
To thee will I give the maiden free,<BR>
And part her from that lover."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then she gave unto him a dress so new,<BR>
With gold and pearls bedight;<BR>
Every seam on the dress it was<BR>
With precious stones all bright.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then she gave unto him a horse so good,<BR>
And therewith a new sell;<BR>
"And never shalt thou the way inquire,<BR>
Thy horse will find it well."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Diva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<BR>
She would show her good-wifi to the knight;<BR>
So she gave unto him a spear so new,<BR>
And therewith a good sword so bright.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And never shalt thou fight a fight,<BR>
Where thou shalt not the victory gain;<BR>
And never shalt thou sail on a sea<BR>
Where thou shalt not the land attain."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was Thor; the little Dwarf's wife,<BR>
She wine in a glass for him poured:<BR>
"Ride away, ride away, now Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
Before the return of my lord."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
He rideth under the green hill side,<BR>
There then met him the hill-kings two,<BR>
As slow to the hill they ride.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Well met! Good day, now Sir Thynn&egrave;!<BR>
Thy horse can well with thee pace;<BR>
Whither directed is thy course?<BR>
Since thou 'it bound to a distant place."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Travel shall I and woo;<BR>
Plight me shall I a flower;<BR>
Try shall I my sword so good,<BR>
To my weal or my woe in the stour."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Ride in peace, ride in peace, away, Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
From us thou hast nought to fear;<BR>
They are coming, the champions from Iseland,<BR>
Who with thee long to break a spear."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was the knight Sir Thynn&egrave;,<BR>
He rideth under the green hill side;<BR>
There met him seven Bernisk champions,<BR>
They bid him to halt and abide.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And whether shall we fight to-day,<BR>
For the red gold and the silver;<BR>
Or shall we fight together to-day,<BR>
For both our true loves fair?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was the king's sister's son,<BR>
He was of mood so hasty;<BR>
"Of silver and gold I have enow,<BR>
If thou wilt credit me."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"But hast thou not a fair true love,<BR>
Who is called Lady Hermolin?<BR>
For her it is we shall fight to-day,<BR>
If she shall be mine or thine."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first charge they together rode,<BR>
They were two champions so tall;<BR>
He cut at the king's sister's son,<BR>
That his head to the ground did fall.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Back then rode the champions six,<BR>
And dressed themselves in fur;<BR>
Then went into the lofty hall,<BR>
The aged king before.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And it was then the aged king,<BR>
He tore his gray hairs in woe.<BR>
"Ye<I> </I>must avenge my sister's son's death;<BR>
I will sables and martins bestow. ' [e]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Back then rode the champions six,<BR>
They thought the reward to gain,<BR>
But they remained halt and limbless:<BR>
By loss one doth wit obtain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And he slew wolves and bears,<BR>
All before the high chamber;<BR>
Then taketh he out the maiden free<BR>
Who so long had languished there.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And now hath Lady Hermolin<BR>
Escaped from all harm;<BR>
Now sleeps she sweet full many a sleep,<BR>
On brave Sir Thynn&egrave;'s arm.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And now has brave Sir Thynn&egrave;<BR>
Escaped all sorrow and tine;<BR>
Now sleeps he sweet full many a sleep,<BR>
Beside Lady Hermolin.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most thanketh he Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,<BR>
Who him with the runes had bound,<BR>
For were he not come inside of the bill,<BR>
The lady he never had found. [f]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[a] We have ventured to omit the Omqued. <I>I styren v&auml;ll de Runor! </I>(Manage well the runes!) The final <I>e </I>in Thynn&egrave; ia marked merely to indicate that it is to be sounded.<BR>
<BR>
[b] <I>Runeslag, </I>literally Rune-stroke. Runes originally signified letters, and then songs. They were of two kinds, Maalrunor <I>(Speech-runes), </I>and Trollrunor <I>(Magic-runes); </I>These last were again divided into Skaderunur <I>(Mischief-runes) </I>and Hjelprunor <I>(Help-runes), </I>of each of which there were five kinds. See Verelius' notes to the Hervarar Saga, cap. 7.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The power of music over all nature is a subject of frequent recurrence in northern poetry. Here all the wild animals are entranced by the magic tones of the harp; the meads flower, the trees put forth leaves; the knight, though grave and silent, is attracted, and even if included to stay away, he cannot restrain his horse.<BR>
<BR>
[c] <I>Rosendelund. </I>The word <I>Lund </I>signifies any kind of grove, thicket, <I>&amp;c.<BR>
<BR>
</I>[d]<I> </I>Not the island of Iceland, but a district in Norway of that name. By Berner-land, Geijer thinks is meant the land of Bern (Verona), the country of Dietrich, so celebrated in German romance.<BR>
<BR>
[e] <I>Sabel och M&aring;rd. </I>These furs are always mentioned In the northern ballads, as the royal rewards of distinguished actions.<BR>
<BR>
[f] This fine ancient Visa was taken down from recitation in West Gothland. The corresponding Danish one of Her T&ouml;nne is much later.</BLOCKQUOTE>
