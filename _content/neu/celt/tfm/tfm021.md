SVEND FAELLING AND THE ELF-MAID

>  

> SVEND FAELLING was, while a little boy, at service in
> Sjeller-wood-house in Framley; and it one time happened that he had to
> ride of a message to Ristrup. It was evening before he got near home,
> and as he came by the hill of Borum Es, he saw the Elle-maids, who
> were dancing without ceasing round and round his horse. Then one of
> the Elle-maids stept up to him, and readied him a drinking cup,
> bidding him at the same time to drink. Svend took the cup, but as he
> was dubious of the nature of the contents, he flung it out over his
> shoulder, where it fell on the horse's back, and singed off all the
> hair. While he had the horn fast in his band, be gave his horse the
> spurs and rode off full speed. The Elle-maid pursued him till he came
> to Trigebrand's mill, and rode through the running water, over which
> she could not follow him. She then earnestly conjured Svend to give
> her back the horn, promising him in exchange twelve men's strength. On
> this condition he gave back the horn, and got what she had promised
> him; but it very frequently put him to great inconvenience, for he
> found that along with it be had gotten an appetite for twelve. \[a\]

> In the Nibelungen Lied (st. 345) Sifret (Sigurd) gets the strength of
> twelve men by wearing the *tarnkappe* of the dwarf Albrich. Another
> tradition, presently to be mentioned, says it was from a Dwarf he got
> his strength, for aiding him in battle against another Dwarf. It is
> added, that when Svend came home in the evening, after his adventure
> with the Elle-maids, the people were drinking their Yule-beer, and
> they sent him down for a fresh supply. Svend went without saying
> anything, and returned with a barrel in each hand and one under each
