> It was the Druid's presage, who had long  
> In Geirionydd's \[a\] airy temple marked  
> The songs that from the Gwyllion \[b\] rose, of eve  
> The children, in the bosom of the lakes.  
> *Taliesin*.

> THE oldest account we have met with of Welsh Fairies is in the
> Itinerary of Giraldus Cambrensis, who, in the year 1188, accompanied
> Archbishop Baldwin in his tour through Wales, undertaken for the
> purpose of exciting the zeal of the people to take part in the crusade
> then in contemplation.

> Giraldus, who was an attentive observer of nature and of mankind, has
> in this work given many beautiful descriptions of scenery, and
> valuable traits of manners. He is liberal of legends of saints, but
> such was the taste of his age. Among his narratives, however, he gives
> the two following, which show that there was a belief in South Wales
> in beings similar to the Fairies and Hobgoblins of England.
