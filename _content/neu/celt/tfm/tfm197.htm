<P ALIGN="CENTER">ALEXANDER SELKIRK'S DREAM</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">COMPOSED ONE DAY WHEN CONFINED TO BED BY A COLD<BR>
AND UNABLE TO READ</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>O'ER the isle of Juan Fernandez<BR>
Cooling shades of evening spread,<BR>
While upon the peaks of Andes<BR>
Still the tints of day were shed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>From the sea-beat shore returning <BR>
Homeward hied the lonely man,<BR>
O'er his cheerless fortune mourning, <BR>
As through past days memory ran.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Soon his brief repast was ended<BR>
And he sought his lowly bed;<BR>
Balmy slumber there descended,<BR>
Shedding influence o'er his head.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then a vision full of gladness<BR>
Came, sent forth by Him supreme,<BR>
Who his suffering servants' sadness <BR>
Oft dispelleth in a dream.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>*</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In his view the lively dream sets<BR>
Hills and vales in verdure bright;<BR>
Where the gaily-prattling streamlets <BR>
Sparkle in the morning-light.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hark! the holy bell is swinging,<BR>
Calling to the house of prayer;<BR>
Loud resounds the solemn ringing<BR>
Through the still and balmy air.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Youths and maids from glen and mountain <BR>
Hasten at the hallowed sound,<BR>
Old men rest by shady fountain,<BR>
Children lay them on the ground.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now the pious throng is streaming <BR>
Through the temple's portal low;<BR>
Rapture in each face is beaming<BR>
Pure devotion's genuine glow.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fervently the hoary pastor,<BR>
Humbly bent before his God,<BR>
Supplicates their heavenly Master<BR>
Them to lead on Sion's road;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Owns that all have widely erred<BR>
From the true, the narrow way,<BR>
That with Him we have no merit,<BR>
And no claim of right can lay.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Loud then rise in choral measure <BR>
Hymns of gratitude and praise,<BR>
As, inspired with solemn pleasure,<BR>
Unto Heaven their strains they raise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now the grave discourse beginneth,<BR>
Which, ungraced by rhetoric's arts,<BR>
Quick the rapt attention winneth,<BR>
While it glorious truths imparts;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it tells how kind is Heaven<BR>
To the race of him who fell;<BR>
How of old the Son was given<BR>
To redeem from pains of hell;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How the Holy Spirit abideth<BR>
In their hearts that hear his call;<BR>
How our God for all provideth,<BR>
How His mercy's over all;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>How, beyond the grave extending,<BR>
Regions lie of endless bliss;<BR>
How our thoughts on that world bending, <BR>
We should careless be of this.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once again the raised hymn pealeth<BR>
Notes of joy and jubilee,<BR>
Praising Him who truth revealeth,<BR>
Dweller of Eternity!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>*</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Night's dim shades were now retreating, <BR>
Over Andes rose the day<BR>
On the hills the kids' loud bleating<BR>
Lingering slumber chased away.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Birds their merry notes were singing, <BR>
Joyous at the approach of morn--<BR>
Morn that, light and fragrance flinging, <BR>
Earth doth cherish and adorn.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Waked by Nature's general chorus<BR>
Selkirk quits his lonely couch,<BR>
While o'er heaven run colours glorious, <BR>
Heralding the sun's approach.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Still the vision hovers o'er him, <BR>
Still the heavenly strains he hears,<BR>
Setting those bright realms before him<BR>
Where are wiped away all tears.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All this vain and transitory <BR>
State of mankind here on earth,<BR>
Weighed with that exceeding glory,<BR>
Now he deems as nothing worth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Low he bends in adoration,<BR>
As the sun ascends the sky;<BR>
Doubt and fear and lamentation<BR>
With the night's last shadows fly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
