<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THE grandfather of Reor, who dwelt at Fuglek&auml;rr (i.e. <I>Bird-marsh), </I>in the parish of Svartsborg <I>(Black-castle), </I>lived close to a hill, and one time, in the broad daylight, be saw sitting there on a stone a comely maiden. He wished to intercept her, and for this purpose <I>he threw steel </I>between her and the hill; whereupon her father laughed within the hill, and opening the hill-door asked him if he would have his daughter. He replied in the affirmative and as she was <I>stark naked </I>he took some of his own clothes and covered her with them, and he afterwards had her christened. As he was going away, her father said. to him, "When you are going to have your wedding <I>(br&ouml;llup) </I>you must provide twelve barrels of beer and bake a heap of bread and the flesh of four oxen, and drive to the barrow or hill where I keep, and when the bridal gifts are to be bestowed, depend on it I will give mine." This also came to pass; for when others were giving he raised the cover of the cart and cast into it so large a bag of money that the body of it nearly broke, saying at the same time:--" This is <I>my </I>gift!" He said, moreover, "When you want to have your wife's portion <I>(hemmagifta),</I>[a]<I> </I>you must drive to the hill with four horses, and get your share. When he came there afterwards at his desire he got copper-pots, the one larger than the other till the largest pot of all was filled with the smaller ones. He also gave him other things, [b] which were helmets, of that colour and fashion which are large and thick, and which are still remaining in the country, being preserved at the parsonage of Tanum. This man Reor's father surnamed I Foglek&auml;rsten, had a number of children by this wife of his, whom he fetched out of the hill, among whom was the aforesaid Reor. Olaf Stenson also in Stora Rijk, who died last year, was Reor's sister's son. [c]</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[a] This we suppose to be the meaning of <I>hemmagifta, </I>as it Is that of <I>hemgift, </I>the only word approaching to it that we have met in our dictionary.<BR>
<BR>
[b] <I>Brandcreatur, </I>a word of which we cannot ascertain the exact meaning. We doubt greatly if the following <I>hielmeta </I>be helmets.<BR>

[c] Grimm (Deut. Mythol. p. 435) has extracted this legend from the Bahusl&auml;n of Odman, who, as he observes, and as we may see, relates it quite seriously, and with the real names of persons. It is we believe the only legend of the union of a <I>man </I>with one of the hill-folk.</BLOCKQUOTE>
