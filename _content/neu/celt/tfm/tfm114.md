THE FAIRIES' CALDRON

>   
>   
> "IN the vestry of Frensham church, in Surrey, on the north side of the
> chancel, is an extraordinary great kettle or caldron, which the
> inhabitants say, by tradition, was brought hither by the fairies, time
> out of mind, from Borough-hill, about a mile hence. To this place, if
> anyone went to borrow a yoke of oxen, money, etc., he might have it
> for a year or longer, so he kept his word to return it. There is a
> cave where some have fancied to hear music. In this Borough hill is a
> great stone, lying along the length of about six feet. They went to
> this stone and knocked at it, and declared what they could borrow, and
> when they would repay, and a voice would answer when they should come,
> and that they should find what they desired to borrow at that stone.
> This caldron, with the trivet, was borrowed here after the manner
> aforesaid, and not returned according to promise; and though the
> caldron was afterwards carried to the stone, it could not be received,
> and ever since that time no borrowing there." \[a\]
