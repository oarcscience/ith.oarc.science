CURIOUSITY PUNISHED

>   
> IN old times men lived in the valley, and around them, in the clefts
> and holes of the rocks, dwelt the Dwarfs. They were kind and friendly
> to the people, often performing hard and heavy work for them in the
> night; and when the country-people came early in the morning with
> their carts and tools, they saw, to their astonishment, that the work
> was already done, while the Dwarfs hid themselves in the bushes, and
> laughed aloud at the astonished rustics. Often, too, were the peasants
> incensed to find their corn, which was scarcely yet ripe, lying cut on
> the ground; but shortly after there was sure to come on such a
> hail-storm, that it became obvious that hardly a single stalk could
> have escaped destruction had it not been cut, and then, from the
> bottom of their hearts, they thanked the provident Dwarf-people. But
> at last mankind, through, their own folly, deprived themselves of the
> favour and kindness of the Dwarfs; they fled the country, and since
> that time no mortal eye has seen them. The cause of their departure
> was this:

> A shepherd had a fine cherry-tree \[a\] that stood on the mountain.
> When in the summer the fruit had ripened, it happened that, three
> times running, the tree was-stript, and all tie fruit spread out on
> the benches and hurdles, where the shepherd himself used to spread it
> out to dry for the winter. The people of the village all said, "It
> could be none but the good-natured Dwarfs, who come by night tripping
> along with their feet covered with long mantles, as light as birds,
> and industriously perform for mankind their daily work. People have
> often watched them," continued the narrators, "but no one disturbs
> them; they are left to come and go as they please." This talk only
> excited the curiosity of the shepherd, and he longed to know why it
> was that the Dwarfs so carefully concealed their feet, and whether
> they were differently formed from those of men. Accordingly, next
> year, when the summer came, and the time when the Dwarfs secretly
> pulled the cherries, and brought them to the barn, the shepherd took a
> sack full of ashes, and strewed them about under the cherry-tree. Next
> morning, at break of day, he hastened to the place: the tree was
> plucked completely empty, and he saw the marks of several goose-feet
> impressed on the ashes. The shepherd then laughed and jested at having
> discovered the Dwarfs' secret. But soon after the Dwarfs broke and
> laid waste their houses, and fled down deeper in the mountain to their
> splendid secret palace, that had long lain empty to receive them.
> Vexed with mankind, they never more granted them their aid; and the
> imprudent shepherd who had betrayed them became sickly, and continued
> so to the end of his life. \[b\]

> \[a\] In several of the high valleys of Switzerland it is only a
> single cherry-tree which hippens to be favourably situated that bears
> fruit. It bears abundantly and the fruit ripens about the month of
> August.

> \[b\] Compare the narrative in the Swiss dialect given by Grimm, Deut.
> Mythol. P. 419. The same peasant of Belp who related the first legend
> was Mr. Wyss's authority for this one. "The vanishing of the
> Bergänlein," says Mr Wyss, "appears to be a matter of importance to
> the popular faith. It is almost always ascribed to the fault of
> mankind--sometimes to their wickedness.

> We may in these tales recognise the box of Pandora under a different
> form, but the ground is the same. Curiosity and wickedness are still
> the cause of superior beings withdrawing their favour from man.

> "I have never anywhere else," says Mr Wyss, "heard of the goose-feet;
> but that all is not right with their feet is evident from the popular
> tradition giving long trailing mantles as the dress of the little
> people. Some will have it that their feet are regularly formed, but
> set on their legs the wrong way, so that the toes are behind and the
> heels before."

> Heywood in his Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels, p. 554, relates a
> story which would seem to refer to a similar belief.
