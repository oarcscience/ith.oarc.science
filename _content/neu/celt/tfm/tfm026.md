DWARFS OR TROLLS

>  

> Ther bygde folk i the bärg,  
> Quinnor och män, för mycken duerf.

> HIST. ALEX. MAG. *Suedice*.

> Within the hills folk did won,  
> Women and men, dwarfs many a one.

>  

> THE more usual appellation of the Dwarfs is Troll or Trold, \[a\] word
> originally significant of any evil spirit, \[b\] giant monster,
> magician \[c\] or evil person; but now in a good measure divested of
> its ill senses, for the Trolls are not in general regarded as noxious
> or malignant beings.

> The Trolls are represented as dwelling inside of hills, mounds, and
> hillocks--whence they are also called Hill-people
> (*Bjergfolk*)--sometimes in single families, sometimes in societies.
> In the ballads they are described as having kings over them, but never
> so in the popular legend. Their character seems gradually to have sunk
> down to the level of the peasantry, in proportion as the belief in
> them was consigned to the same class. They are regarded as extremely
> rich for when, on great occasions of festivity, they have their hills
> raised up on red pillars, people that have chanced to be passing by
> have seen them shoving large chests full of money to and fro, and
> opening and clapping down the lids of them. Their hill-dwellings are
> very magnificent inside. "They live," said one of Mr. Arndt's guides,
> "in fine houses of gold and crystal. My father saw them once in the
> night, when the hill was open on St. John's night. They were dancing
> and drinking, and it seemed to him as if they were making signs to him
> to go to them, but his horse snorted, and carried him away, whether he
> would or no. There is a great number of them in the Guldberg
> *(Goldhill),* and they have brought into it all the gold and silver
> that people buried in the great Russian war." \[d\]

> They are obliging and neighbourly; freely lending and borrowing, and
> elsewise keeping up a friendly intercourse with mankind. But they have
> a sad propensity to thieving, not only stealing provisions, but even
> women and children.

> They marry, have children, bake and brew, just as the peasant himself
> does. A farmer one day met a bill-man and his wife, and a whole squad
> of stumpy little children, in his fields; \[e\] and people used often
> to see the children of the man who lived in the hill of Kund, in
> Jutland, climbing up the hill, and rolling down after one another,
> with shouts of laughter.

> The Trolls have a great dislike to noise, probably from a recollection
> of the time when Thor used to be flinging his hammer after them; so
> that the hanging of bells in the churches has driven them almost all
> out of the country. The people of Ebeltoft were once sadly plagued by
> them, as they plundered their pantries in a most unconscionable
> manner; so they consulted a very wise and pious man; and his advice
> was, that they should hang a bell in the steeple of the church. They
> did so, and they were soon eased of the Trolls. \[f\]

> These beings have some very extraordinary and useful properties; they
> can, for instance, go about invisibly, \[g\] or turn themselves into
> any shape; they can foresee future events; they can confer prosperity,
> or the contrary, on a family; they can bestow bodily strength on any
> one; and, in short, perform numerous feats beyond the power of man.

> Of personal beauty they have not much to boast: the Ebeltoft Dwarfs,
> mentioned. above, were often seen, and they had immoderate humps on
> their backs, and long crooked noses. They were dressed in gray
> jackets, \[h\] and they wore pointed red caps. Old people in Zealand
> say, that when the Trolls were in the country, they used to go from
> their hill to the village of Gudmandstrup through the Stone-meadow,
> and that people, when passing that way, used to meet great tall men in
> long black clothes. Some have foolishly spoken to them, and wished
> them good evening, but they never got any other answer than that the
> Trolls hurried past them, saying, Mi! mi! mi! mi!

> Thanks to the industry of Mr. Thiele, who has been indefatigable in
> collecting the traditions of his native country, we are furnished with
> ample accounts of the Trolls; and the following legends will fully
> illustrate what we have written concerning them. \[i\]

> We commence with the Swedish ballads of the Hill-kings, as in dignity
> and antiquity they take precedence of the legends.

> \[a\] There is no etymon of this word. It is to be found in both the
> Icelandic and the Finnish languages; whether the latter borrowed or
> communicated it is uncertain. Ihre derives the name of the celebrated
> waterfall of Trollhaeta, near Gotenburg, from Troll, and Haute
> *Lapponice,* an abyss. It therefore answers to the Irish
> *Poul-a-Phooka.* See *Ireland.  
>   
> *\[b\] In the following lines quoted in the Heimskringla, it would
> seem to signify the Dii Manes.

> Tha gaf hann Trescegg Tröllum,  
> Torf-Einarr drap Scurfo.

> Then gave he Trescegg to the Trolls,  
> Turf-Einarr slew Scurfo.

> \[c\] The ancient Gothic nation was called Troll by their Vandal
> neighbours (Junii Batavia, c. 27); according to Sir J. Malcolm, the
> Tartars call the Chinese Deevs. It was formerly believed, says Ihre,
> that the noble family of Troll, in Sweden, derived their name from
> having killed a Troll, that is, probably, a Dwarf.  
>   
> \[d\] Arndt, Reise nach Schweden, vol. III. p. 8.  
>   
> \[e\] Like our Fairies the Trolls are sometimes of marvellously small
> dimensions: in the Danish ballad of Eline af Villenskov we read--

> Det da meldte den mindste Trold,  
> Han var ikke större end en myre,  
> Her er kommet en Christen mand,  
> Den maa jag visseligen styre.

> Out then spake the tinyest Troll,  
> No bigger than an emmet was he,  
> Hither is come a Christian man,  
> And manage him will I surelie.

> \[f\] Thiele, i. 36.  
>   
> \[g\] For this they seem to be indebted to their hat or cap. Eske Brok
> being one day in the fields, knocked off, without knowing it, the hat
> of a Dwarf who instantly became visible, and had, in order to recover
> it, to grant him every thing he asked. Thiele iii. 49. This hat
> answers to the Tarnkappe or Hel-kaplein of the German Dwarfs; who also
> become visible when their caps are struck off.  
>   
> \[h\] In the Danish ballad of Eline af Villenskov the hero is called
> *Trolden graae,* the Gray Trold, probably from the colour of his
> habiliments.  
>   
> \[i\] We deem it needless in future to refer to volume and page of Mr.
> Thiele's work. Those acquainted with the original will easily find the
> legends.
