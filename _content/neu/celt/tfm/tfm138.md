THE FAIRY'S ENQUIRY

>  

> A CLERGYMAN was returning home one night after visiting a sick member
> of his congregation. His way led by a lake, and as he proceeded he was
> surprised to hear most melodious strains of music. He sat down to
> listen. The music seemed to approach coming over the lake accompanied
> by a light. At length he discerned a man walking on the water,
> attended by a number of little beings, some bearing lights, others
> musical instruments. At the beach the man dismissed his attendants,
> and then walking up to the minister saluted him courteously. He was a
> little grey-headed old man, dressed in rather an unusual garb. The
> minister having returned his salute begged of him to come and sit
> beside him. He complied with the request, and on being asked who he
> was, replied that he was one of the Daoine Shi. He added that he and
> they had originally been angels, but having been seduced into revolt
> by Satan, they had been cast down to earth where they were to dwell
> till the day of doom. His object now was, to ascertain from the
> minister what would be their condition after that awful day. The
> minister then questioned him on the articles of faith; but as his
> answers did not prove satisfactory, and as in repeating the Lord's
> Prayer, he persisted in saying *wed* instead of *art in heaven,* he
> did not feel himself justified in holding out any hopes to him. The
> fairy then gave a cry of despair and flung himself into the loch, and
> the minister resumed his journey.
