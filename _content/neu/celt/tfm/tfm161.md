THE SPIRIT OF THE VAN

>  

> AMONG the mountains of Carmarthen, lies a beautiful and romantic piece
> of water, named The Van Pools. Tradition relates, that after midnight,
> on New Year's Eve, there appears on this lake a being named The Spirit
> of the Van. She is dressed in a white robe, bound by a golden girdle;
> her hair is long and golden, her face is pale and melancholy; she sits
> in a golden boat, and manages a golden oar.

> Many years ago there lived in the vicinity of this lake a young
> farmer, who having heard much of the beauty of this spirit, conceived
> a most ardent desire to behold her, and be satisfied of the truth. On
> the last night of the year, he therefore went to the edge of the lake,
> which lay calm and bright beneath the rays of the full moon, and
> waited anxiously for the first hour of the New Year. It came, and then
> he beheld the object of his wishes gracefully guiding her golden
> gondola to and fro over the lake. The moon at length sank behind the
> mountains, the stars grew dim at the approach of dawn, and the fair
> spirit was on the point of vanishing, when, unable to restrain
> himself, he called aloud to her to stay and be his wife; but with a
> faint cry she faded from his view. Night after night he now might be
> seen pacing the shores of the lake, but all in vain. His farm was
> neglected, his person wasted away, and gloom and melancholy were
> impressed on his features. At length he confided his secret to one of
> the mountain-sages, whose counsel was--a Welsh one, by the way--to
> assail the fair spirit with gifts of cheese and bread! The counsel was
> followed; and on Midsummer Eve the enamoured swain went down to the
> lake, and let fall into it a large cheese and a loaf of bread. But all
> was vain; no spirit rose. Still he fancied that the spot where he had
> last seen her shone with more than wonted brightness, and that a
> musical sound vibrated among the rocks. Encouraged by these signs, he
> night after night threw in loaves and cheeses, but still no spirit
> came. At length New Year's Eve returned. He dressed himself in his
> best, took his largest cheese and seven of his whitest loaves, and
> repaired to the lake. At the turn of midnight, he dropped them slowly
> one by one into the water, and then remained in silent expectation.
> The moon was hid behind a cloud, but by the faint light she gave, he
> saw the magic skiff appear, and direct its course for where he stood.
> Its owner stepped ashore, and hearkened to the young man's vows, and
> consented to become his wife. She brought with her as her dower flocks
> and herds, and other rural wealth. One charge she gave him, never to
> strike her, for the third time he should do so she would vanish.

> They married, and were happy. After three or four years they were
> invited to a christening, and to the surprise of all present, in the
> midst of the ceremony, the spirit burst into tears. Her husband gave
> an angry glance, and asked her why she thus made a fool of herself?
> She replied, "The poor babe is entering in a world of sin and sorrow,
> and misery lies before it; why should I rejoice?" He gave her a push.
> She warned him that he had struck her once. Again they were, after
> some time, invited to attend the funeral of that very child. The
> spirit now laughed, and danced, and sang. Her husband's wrath was
> excited, and he asked her why she thus made a fool of herself? "The
> babe," she said, "has left a world of sin and sorrow, and escaped the
> misery that was before it, and is gone to be good and happy for ever
> and ever. Why, then, should I weep?" He gave her a push from him, and
> again she warned him. Still they lived happily as before. At length
> they were invited to a wedding, where the bride was young and fair,
> the husband a withered old miser. In the midst of the festivity, the
> spirit burst into a copious flood of tears, and to her husband's angry
> demand of why she thus made a fool of herself, she replied in the
> hearing of all, "Because summer and winter cannot agree. Youth is
> wedded to age for paltry gold. I see misery here, and tenfold misery
> hereafter, to be the lot of both. It is the devil's compact."
> Forgetful of her warnings, the husband now thrust her from him with
> real anger. She looked at him tenderly and reproachfully, and said,
> "You have struck me for the third and last time. Farewell!"

> So saying, she left the place. He rushed out after her, and just
> reached his home in time to see her speeding to the lake, followed by
> all her flocks and herds. He pursued her, but in vain; his eyes never
> more beheld her. \[a\]

> As far as we have been able to learn, the belief in Fairies is
> confined in Wales to the southern counties of Glamorgan, Carmarthen,
> and Pembroke, the parts into which the Saxons had penetrated farthest,
> and where they of course had exercised most influence. In these
> counties the popular belief in these beings is by no means yet
> extinct, and their attributes in the creed of the Welsh peasant are
> similar to those of their British and Irish kindred.

> The usual name given to the fairies in these parts of Wales, is Y
> Dynon Bach Têg, i. e. *The Little Fair People.* Ellyll, in the plural
> Ellyllon, also signifies an Elf, from which word, indeed, it may have
> been derived. The bells of the Digitalis or fox-glove are called Menyg
> Ellylon, or the Elves'-gloves; in Ireland, also, they are connected
> with the fairies. The toadstools or poisonous mushrooms are named Bwyd
> Ellyllon, or Elves'-food. Perhaps, however, it is not the large ugly
> toadstools that are so named, but those pretty small delicate fungi,
> with their conical heads, which are named Fairy-mushrooms in Ireland,
> where they grow so plentifully. Finally, there was formerly in the
> park of Sir Robert Vaughan a celebrated old oak-tree, named
> Crwbenyr-Ellyll, or The Elf's Hollow-tree. The popular belief
> respecting these Ellyllon is, that they are the souls of the ancient
> Druids, who, being too good for relegation to Hell, and too evil for
> re-admittance to Heaven, are permitted to wander among men upon earth
> till the last day, when they also will enter on a higher state of
> being. \[b\]

> The legends of which we will now proceed to give a specimen, were
> collected and published in the latter half of the eighteenth century,
> by a Welsh clergyman, who seems to have entertained no doubt whatever
> of the truth of the adventures contained in them. \[c\]

> The two daughters of a respectable farmer in the parish of Bedweilty
> were one day out hay-making with their man and maid servant and a
> couple of their neighbours, when on a hill, about quarter of a mile
> distant, they saw a large flock of sheep. Soon after, they saw them
> going up to a place half a mile off, and then going out of their sight
> as if they vanished in the air. About half-an-hour before sunset, they
> saw them again, but not all alike; for some saw them like sheep, some
> like greyhounds, some like swine, and some like naked infants. They
> appeared in the shade of the mountain between them and the sun, and
> the first sight was as if they rose out of the earth. "This was a
> notable appearance of the fairies, seen by credible witnesses. The
> sons of infidelity are very unreasonable not to believe the
> testimonies of so many witnesses of the being of spirits."

> E. T. going home by night over Bedwellty Mountains, saw the fairies on
> each side of him. Some of them were dancing. He also heard the sound
> of a bugle-horn, as if people were hunting. He began to grow afraid,
> but recollecting to have heard that if on seeing the fairies, you draw
> out your knife, they will vanish, he did so, and saw them no more.
> "This the old gentleman sincerely related to me. He was a sober man,
> and of the strictest veracity."

> A young man having gone early one morning to a barn to feed oxen, when
> he had done, lay down on the hay to rest. As he lay he heard the sound
> of music approaching the barn, and presently came in a large company,
> wearing striped clothes (some more gay than others), and commenced
> dancing to their music. He lay quite still, thinking to escape their
> notice; but a woman, better dressed than the others, came up to him
> with a striped cushion, with a tassel at each corner, and put it under
> his head. Some time after, a cock was heard to crow, which seemed
> either to surprise or displease them, and they hastily drew the
> cushion from under his head, and went away.

> P. W., "an honest virtuous woman," related that one time, when she was
> a little girl on her way to school, she saw the fairies dancing under
> a crab-tree. As they appeared to be children of her own size, and had
> small pleasant music, she went and joined in their exercise, and then
> took them to dance in an empty barn. This she continued to do for
> three or four years. As she never could hear the sound of their feet,
> she always took off her shoes, supposing noise to be displeasing to
> them. They were of small stature, looked rather old, and wore blue and
> green aprons. Her grandfather, who kept school in the parish-church,
> used, when going home from it late in the evening, to see the fairies
> dancing under an oak, within two or three fields of the church.

> The learned writer gives finally a letter to himself, from a "pious
> young gentleman" of Denbighshire, dated March 24, 1772, in which he
> informs him, that about fifteen years before, as himself, his sister,
> and two other little girls were playing at noon of a summer's day in a
> field, they saw a company of dancers, about seventy yards from them.
> Owing to the rapidity of their whirling motions, they could not count
> them, but guessed them at fifteen or sixteen. They were in red, like
> soldiers, with red handkerchiefs spotted with yellow, on their heads.
> As they were gazing and wondering at them, one of the dancers came
> running towards them. The children, in a fright, made for an adjacent
> stile. The girls got over, but the boy was near being caught, and on
> looking back when over, he saw the red man stretching his arms after
> him over the stile, which it would seem he had not the power to cross.
> When they came to the house, which was close at hand, they gave the
> alarm, and people went out to search the fields, but could see
> nothing. The little man was very grim-looking, with a topper-coloured
> face. His running-pace was rather slow, but he took great strides for
> one of his size.

>  

> The following legends were collected in 1827, in the Vale of Neath, in
> Glamorganshire, by a lady with whom we became acquainted when
> travelling through North Wales, in the preceding autumn. \[d\]

> An old woman assured our fair friend, that she one time, many years
> before, saw the fairies to the number of some hundreds. They were very
> small, were mounted on little white horses, not bigger than dogs, and
> rode four a-breast. It was almost dusk at the time, and they were not
> a quarter of a mile from her. Another old woman said that her father
> had often seen the fairies riding in the air on little white horses,
> but he never saw them come down on the ground. He also used to hear
> their music in the air. She had heard, too, of a man who had been
> five-and-twenty years with the fairies, and thought he had been away
> only five minutes.
