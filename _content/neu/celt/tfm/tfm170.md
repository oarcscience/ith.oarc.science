GREECE

>  

> Like a tender Nymph  
> Within the dewy caves.  
> Euripides

> THE Grecian mythology, like its kindred systems, abounded in
> personifications. \[a\] Modified by scenery so beautiful, rich, and
> various as Hellas presented, it in general assigned the supposed
> intelligences who presided over the various parts of external nature
> more pleasing attributes than they elsewhere enjoyed. They were mostly
> conceived to be of the female sex, and were denominated Nymphs, a word
> originally signifying a new-married woman.

> Whether it be owing to soil, climate, or to an original disposition of
> mind and its organ, the Greeks have above all other people possessed a
> perception of beauty of form, and a fondness for representing it. The
> Nymphs of various kinds were therefore always presented to the
> imagination, in the perfection of female youth and beauty. Under the
> various appellations of Oreades, Dryades, Naides, Limniades, Nereides,
> they dwelt in mountains, trees, springs, lakes, the seas where, in
> caverns and grottos, they passed a life whose occupations resembled
> those of females of human rare. The Wood-nymphs were the companions
> and attendants of the huntress goddess Artemis; the Sea-nymphs averted
> shipwreck from pious navigators; and the Spring- and River-nymphs
> poured forth fruitfulness on the earth. All of them were honoured with
> prayer and sacrifice; and all of them occasionally 'mingled in love'
> with favoured mortals.

> In the Homeric poems, the most ancient portion of Grecian literature,
> we meet the various classes of Nymphs. In the Odyssey, they are the
> attendants of Calypso, herself a goddess and a nymph. Of the female
> attendants of Circe, the potent daughter of Helios, also designated as
> a goddess and a nymph, it is said,

> They spring from fountains and from sacred groves,  
> And holy streams that flow into the sea.

> Yet these nymphs are of divine nature, and when Zeus, the father of
> the gods, calls together his council,

> None of the streams, save Ocean, stayed away,  
> Nor of the Nymphs, who dwell in beauteous groves,  
> And springs of streams, and verdant grassy slades.

> The good Eumaeus prays to the Nymphs to speed the return of his
> master, reminding them of the numerous sacrifices Ulysses had offered
> to them. In another part of the poem, their sacred cave is thus
> described:--

> But at the harbour's head a long-leafed olive  
> Grows, and near to it lies a lovely cave,  
> Dusky and sacred to the Nymphs, whom men  
> Call Naides. In it large craters lie,  
> And two-eared pitchers, all of stone, and there  
> Bees build their combs. In it, too, are long looms  
> Of stone, and there the Nymphs do weave their robes  
> Sea-purple, wondrous to behold. Aye-flowing  
> Waters are there; two entrances it hath;  
> That to the north is pervious unto men;  
> That to the south more sacred is, and there  
> Men enter not, but 'tis the Immortals' path.

> Yet though thus exalted in rank, the Homeric Nymphs frequently
> 'blessed the bed' of heroes; and many a warrior who fought before Troy
> could boast descent from a Nais or a Nereis.

> The sweet, gentle, pious, Ocean-nymphs, who in the Prometheus of
> Aeschylus appear as the consolers and advisers of its dignified hero,
> seem to hold a nearly similar relation with man to the supernal gods.
> Beholding the misery inflicted on Prometheus by the power of Zeus,
> they cry,--

> May never the all-ruling  
> Zeus set his rival power  
> Against my thoughts;  
> Nor may I ever fail  
> The gods, with holy feasts  
> Of sacrifices, drawing near,  
> Beside the ceaseless stream  
> Of father Ocean:  
> Nor may I err in words;  
> But this abide with me  
> And never fade away.

> One of the most interesting species of Nymphs is the Dryads, or
> Hamadryads, those personifications of the vegetable life of plants. In
> the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite, we find the following full and accurate
> description of them. Aphrodite, when she informs Anchises of her
> pregnancy, and her shame to have it known among the gods, says of the
> child;--

> But him, when first he sees the sun's clear light,  
> The Nymphs shall rear, the mountain-haunting Nymphs,  
> Deep-bosomed, who on this mountain great  
> And holy dwell, who neither goddesses  
> Nor women are. Their life is long; they eat  
> Ambrosial food, and with the deathless frame  
> The beauteous dance. With them, in the recess  
> Of lovely caves, well-spying Argos-slayer  
> And the Sileni mix in lova Straight pines  
> Or oaks high headed spring with them upon  
> The earth man-feeding, soon as they are born;  
> This fair and flourishing; on the high hills  
> Lofty they stand; the Deathless' sacred grove  
> Men call them, and with iron never cut.  
> But when the fate of death is drawing near,  
> First wither on the earth the beauteous trees,  
> The bark around them wastes, the branches fall,  
> And the Nymph's soul at the same moment leaves  
> The sun's fair light.

> They possessed power to reward and punish these who prolonged or
> abridged the existence of theft associate-tree. In the Argonautics of
> Apollonius Rhodius, Phineus thus explains to the heroes the cause of
> the poverty of Peraebius

> But he was paring the penalty laid on  
> His fathers crime; for one time, cutting trees  
> Alone among the hills, he spurned the prayer  
> Of the Hamadryas Nymph, who, weeping sore,  
> With earnest words besought him not to cut  
> The trunk of an oak tree, which, with herself  
> Coeval, had endured for many a year.  
> But, in the pride of youth, he foolishly  
> Cut it; and to him and to his race the Nymph  
> Gave ever after a lot profitless.

> The Scholiast gives on this passage the following tale from Charon of
> Lampsacus:

> A man, named Rhoecus, happening to see an oak just ready to fall to
> the ground, ordered his slaves to prop it. The Nymph, who had been on
> the point of perishing with the tree, came to him and expressed her
> gratitude to him for having saved her life, and at the same time
> desired him to ask what reward he would. Rhoecus then requested her to
> permit him to be her lover, and the Nymph acceded to his wishes. She
> at the same time charged him strictly to avoid the society of every
> other woman, and told him that a bee should be her messenger. One time
> the bee happened to come to Rhoecus as he was playing at draughts, and
> he made a rough reply. This so incensed the Nymph that she deprived
> him of sight.

> Similar was the fate of the Sicilian Daphnis. \[b\] A Nais loved him
> and forbade him to hold intercourse with any other woman under pain of
> loss of sight. Long he abstained, though tempted by the fairest maids
> of Sicily. At length a princess contrived to intoxicate him: he broke
> his vow, and the threatened penalty was inflicted.
