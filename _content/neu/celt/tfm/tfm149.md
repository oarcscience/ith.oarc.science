THE URISK

>   
> THERE is also in the Highlands a rough hairy spirit, called the Urisk.
> The following legend will display his nature and character:

> To the very great annoyance of a Highland miller, and to the injury of
> the machinery, his mill, he found, used to be set to work at night
> when there was nothing in it to grind. One of his men offered to sit
> up, and try to discover who it was that did it; 'and, having kindled a
> good turf-fire, sat by it to watch. Sleep, however, overcame him, and
> when he awoke about midnight, he saw sitting opposite him a rough
> shaggy being. Nothing daunted, he demanded his name, and was told that
> it was Urisk. The stranger, in return, asked the man his name, who
> replied that it was Myself. The conversation here ended, and Urisk
> soon fell fast asleep. The man then tossed a panful of hot ashes into
> his shaggy lap, which set his hair all on fire. In an agony, and
> screaming with the pain, he ran to the door, and in a loud yelling
> tone several of his brethren were heard to cry out, "What 's the
> matter'with you?" "Oh! he set me on fire!" "Who?" "Myself!" "Then put
> it out yourself" was the reply. \[a\]
