DEER AND VILA

>  

> A YOUNG deer track'd his way through the lone forest  
> One lonely day--another came in sadness--  
> And the third dawn'd, and brought him sighs and sorrow;  
> Then he address'd him to the forest Vila:  
> "Young deer" she said, "thou wild one of the forest!  
> Now tell me what great sorrow has oppress'd thee;  
> Why wanderest thou thus in the forest lonely:  
> Lonely one day--another day in sadness--  
> And the third day with sighs and anguish groaning?"  
> And thus the young deer to the Vila answered:  
> "O thou sweet sister! Vila of the forest!  
> Me has indeed a heavy grief befallen;  
> For I once had a fawn, mine own beloved,  
> And one sad day she sought the running water;  
> She enter'd it, but came not back to bless me.  
> Then, tell me, has she lost her way and. wander'd?  
> Was she pursued and captured by the huntsman?  
> Or has she left me?--has she wholly left me--  
> Loving some other deer--and I forgotten?  
> Oh, if she has but lost her way, and wanders,  
> Teach her to find it--bring her back to love me!  
> Oh, if she has been captured by the huntsman,  
> Then may a fate as sad as mine await him!  
> But if she has forsaken me--if, faithless,  
> She loves another deer and I forgotten--  
> Then may the huntsman speedily o' ertake her." \[a\]

> We have already observed how almost all nations compare female beauty
> to that of the beings of their legendary creed. With the Servians the
> object of comparison is the lovely Vila. "She is fairer than the
> mountain-Vila," is the highest praise of woman's beauty. In the ballad
> of The Sister of the Kapitan Leka, it is said of the heroine
> Rossandra, that in no country, either Turkey, or the land of the
> Kauran, or Jewrs, was her fellow to be found. No white Bula
> (Mohammedan), no Vlachin (Greek), no slender Latiness (Roman
> Catholic), could compare with her,

> And who on the hills hath seen the Vila--  
> E'en the Vila, brother, must to her yield.

> The swiftness of the Vila also affords a subject of comparison: a
> fleet horse is said to be "Vilaish" or "swift as a Vita."

> The Morlacchi of Dalmatia, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson informs us, \[b\]
> believe also in the Vila. They describe her as a handsome female, who
> accompanies the, man who is her favourite everywhere he goes, and
> causes all his undertakings to prosper. One thus favoured is termed
> Vilénik. Another of their objects of belief is the Maçieh, who appears
> in the form of a boy, with a cap on his head, and is always laughing.
> Any one to whom he appears gets the power of commanding him. If
> ordered to bring money, he usually steals it from one of the
> neighbours, and if taxed with his dishonesty, he goes to the sea and
> comes back dripping and with money.
