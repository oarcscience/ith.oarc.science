THE KOBOLDS \[a\]

>  

> Von Kobolt sang die Amme mir  
> Von Kobolt sing' ich winder.  
> VON HALEM.

> Of Kobold sang my nurse to me;  
> Of Kobold I too sing.

>  

> THE Kobold is exactly the same being as the Danish Nis, and Scottish
> Brownie, and English Hobgoblin. \[b\] He performs the very same
> services for the family to whom he attaches himself.

> When the Kobold is about coming into any place, he first makes trial
> of the disposition of the family in this way. He brings chips and
> saw-dust into the house, and throws dirt into the milk vessels. If the
> master of the house takes care that the chips are not scattered about,
> and that the dirt is left in the vessels, and the milk drunk out of
> them, the Kobold comes and stays in the house as long as there is one
> of the family alive.

> The change of servants does not affect the Kobold, who still remains.
> The maid who is going away must recommend her successor to take care
> of him, and treat him well. If she does not so, things go ill with her
> till she is also obliged to leave the place.

> The history of the celebrated Hinzelmann will give most full and
> satisfactory information respecting the nature and properties of
> Kobolds; for such he was, though he used constantly to deny it. His
> history was written at considerable length by a pious minister, named
> Feldmann. MM. Grimm gives us the following abridgement of it. \[c\]

> \[a\] This word is usually derived from the Greek κόβαλος*,* a knave,
> which is found in Aristophanes. According to Grimm (p. 468) the German
> Kobold is not mentioned by any writer anterior to the thirteenth
> century; we find the French Gobelin in the eleventh; see
>
> France.

> \[b\] In Hanover the Will-o'the-wisp is called the Tückebold, s. *e.*
> Tücke-Kobold, and is, as his name denotes, a malicious being. Voss.
> Lyr. Ged., ii. p. 315.

> \[c\] Deutsche Sagen, i. p. 103. Feldmann's work is a l2mo vol. of 379
> pages.
