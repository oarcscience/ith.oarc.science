DWARFS STEALING CORN

>  

> 'Tis not very long since there were Dwarfs at Jüne near Göttingen, who
> used to go into the fields and steal the sheaves of corn. This they
> were able to do the more easily by means of a cap they wore, which
> made them invisible. They did much injury to one man in particular who
> had a great deal of corn. At length he hit on a plan to catch them. At
> noon one day he put a rope round the field, and when the Dwarfs went
> to creep under it, it knocked off their caps. Being now visible, they
> were caught. They gave him many fair words, promising if he would take
> away the rope to give him a peck *(mette)* of money if he came to that
> same place *before sunrise.* He agreed, but a friend whom he consulted
> told him to go not at sunrise but a little before twelve at night, as
> it was at that hour that the day really began. He did as directed, and
> there he found the Dwarfs, who did not expect him, with the peck of
> money. The name of the family that got it is Mettens.

> A farmer in another part of the country being annoyed in a similar
> manner, was told to get willow-rods and beat the air with them, and he
> thus would knock of some of their caps and discover them. He and his
> people did so, and they captured one of the Dwarfs, who told the
> farmer that if he would let him go, he would give him a waggon-load of
> money, but he must come for it before sunrise. At the same time he
> informed him where his abode was. The farmer having enquired when the
> sun really rose, and being told at twelve o'clock, yoked his waggon
> and drove off, but when he came to the Dwarfs' hole, he heard them
> shouting and singing within:

> It is good that the bumpkin doth not know  
> That up at twelve the sun doth go.

> When he asked for something, they showed him a dead horse, and bade
> him take it with him, as they could give him nothing else. He was very
> angry at this, but as he wanted food for his dogs, he cut off a large
> piece and laid it on his waggon. But when he came home, lo! it was all
> pure gold. Others then went to the place, but both hole and horse had
> vanished. \[a\]
