HANS PUNTLEDER

>  

> THERE are three hills on the lands of Bubbelgaard in Funen, which are
> to this day called the Dance-bills, from the following occurrence. A
> lad named Hans was at service in Bubbelgaard, and as he was coming one
> evening past the hills, he saw one of them raised on red pillars, and
> great dancing and much merriment underneath. He was so enchanted with
> the beauty and magnificence of what he saw, that he could not restrain
> his curiosity, but was in a strange and wonderful manner attracted
> nearer and nearer, till *at* last the fairest of all the fair maidens
> that were there came up to him and gave him a kiss. From that moment
> be lost all command of himself, and became so violent, that he used to
> tear to pieces all the clothes that were put on him, so that at last
> they were obliged to make him a dress of sole-leather, which he could,
> not pull off him; and ever after he went by the name of Hans
> Puntleder, i. e. Sole-leather. \[a\]

> According to Danish tradition, the Elle-kings, under the denomination
> of Promontory-kings, *(Klintekonger),* keep watch and ward over the
> country. Whenever war, or any-other misfortune, threatens to come on
> the land, there may be seen, on the promontory, complete armies, drawn
> up in array to defend the country.

> One of these kings resides at Möen, on the spot which still bears the
> name of King's-hill *(Kongsbjerg).* His queen is the most beautiful of
> beings; and she dwells at the Queen's Chair *(Dronningstolen).* This
> king is a great friend of the king of Stevns, and they are both at
> enmity with Grap, the promontory-king of Rűgen, who must keep at a
> distance, and look out over the sea to watch their approach.

> Another tradition, however, says, that there is but one king, who
> rules over the headlands of Möen, Stevns, and Rűgen. He has a
> magnificent chariot, which is drawn by four black horses. In this he
> drives over the sea, from one promontory to another. At such times the
> sea grows black, and is in great commotion, and the loud snorting and
> neighing of his horses may be distinctly heard. \[b\]

> It was once believed that no mortal monarch dare come to Stevns; for
> the Elle-king would not permit him to cross the stream that bounds it.
> But Christian IV passed it without opposition, and since his time
> several Danish monarchs have been there.

> At Skjelskör, in Zealand, reigns another of these jealous promontorial
> sovereigns, named king Tolv *(Twelve).* He will not suffer a mortal
> prince to pass the bridge of Kjelskör. Wo, too, betide the watchman
> who should venture to cry twelve o'clock in the village, he might
> chance to find himself transported to the village of Borre or to the
> Windmills.

> Old people that have eyes for such things, declare they frequently see
> Kong Tolv rolling himself on the grass in the sunshine. On New-year's
> night he takes from one smith's forge or another nine new shoes for
> his horses; they must be always left ready for him, and. with them the
> necessary complement of nails.

> The Elle-king of Bornholm \[c\] lets himself be occasionally heard
> with fife and drum, especially when war is at hand; he may then be
> seen in the fields with his soldiers. This king will not suffer an
> earthly monarch to pass more than three nights on his isle.

> In the popular creed there is some strange connexion between the Elves
> and the trees. They not only frequent them, but they make an
> interchange of form with them. In the church-yard of Store Heddinge,
> \[d\] in Zealand, there are the remains of an oak wood. These, say the
> common people, are the Elle-king's soldiers; by day they are trees, by
> night valiant warriors. In the wood of Rugaard, in the same island, is
> a tree which by night becomes a whole Elle-people, and goes about all
> alive. It has no leaves upon it, yet it would be very unsafe to go to
> break or fell it, for the underground-people frequently hold their
> meetings under its branches. There is, in another place, an elder-tree
> growing in a farm-yard, which frequently takes a walk in the twilight
> about the yard, and peeps in through the window at the children when
> they are alone.

> It was, perhaps, these elder-trees that gave origin to the notion. In
> Danish *Hyld* or *Hyl--*a word not far removed from Elle--is Elder,
> and the peasantry believe that in or under the elder-tree dwells a
> being called Hyldemoer *(Elder-mother),* or Hyldequinde
> *(Elder-woman),* with her ministrant spirits. \[e\] A Danish peasant,
> if he wanted to take any part of an elder-tree, used previously to
> say, three times--" O, Hyldemoer, Hyldemoer! let me take some of thy
> elder, and I will let thee take something of mine in return." If this
> was omitted he would be severely punished. They tell of a man who cut
> down an elder-tree, but he soon after died suddenly. It is, moreover,
> not prudent to have any furniture made of elder-wood. A child was once
> put to lie in a cradle made of this wood, but Hyldemoer came and
> pulled it by the legs, and gave it no rest till it was put to sleep
> elsewhere. Old David Monrad relates, that a shepherd, one night, heard
> his three children crying, and when he inquired the cause, they said
> some one had been sucking them. Their breasts were found to be
> swelled, and they were removed to another room, where they were quiet.
> The reason is said to have been that that room was floored with elder.

> The linden or lime tree is the favourite haunt of the Eves and cognate
> beings; and it is not safe to be near it after sunset. \[f\]
