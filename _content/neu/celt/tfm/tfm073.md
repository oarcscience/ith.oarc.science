THE HILL-MAN AT THE DANCE

>  

> OLD people have positively asserted that some years ago, at the
> celebration of a wedding in the village of Glass, a couple of miles
> from the Wunderberg, and the same distance from the city of Saltzburg,
> there came toward evening a little Hill-man out of the Wunderberg. He
> desired all the guests to be merry and cheerful, and begged to be
> permitted to join in their dance, which request was not refused. He
> accordingly danced three dances with some of the maidens of good
> repute, and with a gracefulness that inspired all present with
> admiration and delight. After the dance he returned them his thanks,
> accompanied by a present to each of the bridal party of three pieces
> of money of an unknown coin, each of which they estimated to be worth
> four creutzers. Moreover, he recommended them to dwell in peace and
> concord, to live like Christians, and, by a pious education, to bring
> up their children in goodness. He told them to lay up these coins with
> their money, and constantly to think of him, and so they would rarely
> come to distress; but warned them against becoming proud, and advised
> them, on the contrary, to relieve their neighbours with their
> superfluities.

> The Hill-man remained with them till night, and took some meat and
> drink from each as they offered it to him, but only very little. He
> then renewed his thanks, and concluded by begging of one of the
> company to put him over the river Satzach, opposite the mountain.
> There was at the wedding a boatman, named John Ständl, who got ready
> to comply with the dwarf's request, and they went together to the
> water's-edge. As they were crossing, the man asked for his payment,
> and the Hill-man humbly presented him three-pence. The boatman utterly
> rejected this paltry payment; but the little man gave him for answer,
> that he should not let that annoy him, but keep the three-pence safe
> and he would never suffer want, provided he put a restraint on
> arrogance. He gave him at the same time, a little stone with these
> words: "Hang this on your neck, and you will never be drowned in the
> water." And of this he had a proof that very year. Finally, the
> Hill-man exhorted him to lead a pious and humble life, and being
> landed on the opposite bank, departed speedily from the place. \[a\]
