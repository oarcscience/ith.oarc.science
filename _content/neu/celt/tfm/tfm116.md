THE PIXY-LABOUR

>  

> ONE night, about twelve o'clock in the morning, as the good folks say,
> who tell this good tale, Dame--the *sage femme* of Tavistock, had just
> got comfortably into bed, when rap, rap, rap, came on her cottage
> door, with such bold and continued noise, that there was a sound of
> authority in every individual knock. Startled and alarmed by the call,
> she arose from her bed, and soon learnt that the summons was a hasty
> one to bid her attend on a patient who needed her help. She opened her
> door, when the summoner appeared to be a strange, squint-eyed, little,
> ugly old fellow, who had a look, as she said, very like a certain dark
> personage, who ought not at all times to be called by his proper name.
> Not at all prepossessed in favour of the errand by the visage of the
> messenger, she nevertheless could not, or dared not, resist the
> command to follow him straight, and attend on "his wife."

> "Thy wife!" thought the good dame; "Heaven forgive me, but as sure as
> I live I be going to the birth of a little divil." A large coal-black
> horse, with eyes like balls of fire, stood at the door. The
> ill-looking old fellow, without more ado, whisked her up on a high
> pillion in a minute, seated himself before her, and away went horse
> and riders as if sailing through the air rather than trotting on the
> ground. How she got to the place of her destination she could not
> tell; but it was a great relief to her fears when she found herself
> set down at the door of a neat cottage, saw a couple of tidy children,
> and remarked her patient to be a decent looking woman, having all
> things about her fitting the time and occasion. A fine bouncing babe
> soon made its appearance, who seemed very bold on its entry into life,
> for it gave the good dame a box on the ear, as, with the coaxing and
> cajolery of all good old nurses, she declared the "sweet little thing
> to be very like its father." The mother said nothing to this, but gave
> nurse a certain ointment, with directions that she should *strike* (i.
> e. *rub)* the child's eyes with it. The nurse performed her task,
> considering what it could be for. She thought that, as no doubt it was
> a good thing, she might just as well try it upon her own eyes as well
> as those of the baby; so she made free to *strike* one of them by way
> of trial, when, O ye powers of fairy land! what a change was there!

> The neat, but homely cottage, and all who were in it, seemed all on a
> sudden to undergo a mighty transformation; some for the better, some
> for the worse. The new-made mother appeared as a beautiful lady
> attired in white; the babe was seen wrapped in swaddling clothes of a
> silvery gauze. It looked much prettier than before, but still
> maintained the elfish cast of the eye, like his father, whilst two or
> three children more had undergone a strange metamorphosis. For there
> sat on either side the bed's head, a couple of little flat-nosed imps,
> who with "mops and mows,' and with many a grimace and grin, were
> busied to no end in scratching their own polls, or in pulling the
> fairy lady's ears with their long and hairy paws. The dame who beheld
> all this, fearing she knew not what, in the house of enchantment, got
> away as fast as she could, without saying one word about *striking*
> her own eye with the magic ointment and what she had seen. The
> sour-looking old fellow once more handed her up on the
> coal-black-horse, and sent her home in a *whip sissa* \[a\] much
> faster than she came.

> On the next market-day, when she sallied forth to sell her eggs, she
> saw the same old fellow busy pilfering sundry articles from stall to
> stall, and going up to him she enquired about his wife and child.
> "What!" exclaimed he, "do you see me to-day?" "See you! to be sure I
> do, as plain as I see the sun in the sky; and I see you are busy,
> too." "Do you?" says he, "and pray with which eye do you see all
> this?" "With the right eye to be sure."

> "The ointment! the ointment!" cried he. "Take that, for meddling with
> what did not belong to you; you shall see me no more."

> He struck her eye as he spoke, and from that hour till the day of her
> death she was blind of that eye.
