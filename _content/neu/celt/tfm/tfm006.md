ARABIAN ROMANCE

>   
>   
> THE Prophet is the centre round which every thing connected with
> Arabia revolves. The period preceding his birth is regarded and
> designated as the times of ignorance, and our knowledge of the ancient
> Arabian mythology comprises little more than he has been pleased to
> transmit to us. The Arabs, however, appear at no period of their
> history to have been a people addicted to fanciful invention. Their
> minds are acute and logical, and their poetry is that of the heart
> rather than of the fancy. They dwell with fondness on the joys and
> pains of love, and with enthusiasm describe the courage and daring
> deeds of warriors, or in moving strains pour forth the plaintive
> elegy; but for the description of gorgeous palaces and fragrant
> gardens, or for the wonders of magic, they are indebted chiefly to
> their Persian neighbours. \[a\]

> What classes of beings the popular creed may have recognised before
> the establishment of Islam we have no means of ascertaining. \[b\] The
> Suspended Poems, and Antar, give us little or no information; we only
> know that the tales of Persia were current among them, and were
> listened to with such avidity as to rouse the indignation of the
> Prophet. We must, therefore, quit the tents of the Bedoween, and the
> valleys of 'Araby the Blest,' and accompany the khaleefehs to their
> magnificent capital on the Tigris, whence emanated all that has thrown
> such a halo of splendour around the genius and language of Arabia. It
> is in this seat of empire that we must look to meet with the origin of
> the marvels of Arabian literature.

> Transplanted to a rich and fertile soil, the sons of the desert
> speedily abandoned their former simple mode of life; and the court of
> Bagdad equalled or surpassed in magnificence any thing that the East
> has ever witnessed. Genius, whatever its direction, was encouraged and
> rewarded, and the musician and the story-teller shared with the
> astronomer and historian the favour of the munificent khaleefehs. The
> tales which had amused the leisure of the Shahpoors and Yezdejirds
> were not disdained by the Haroons and Almansoors. The expert narrators
> altered them so as to accord with the new faith. And it was thus,
> probably, that the delightful Thousand and One Nights \[c\] were
> gradually produced and modified.

> As the Genii or Jinn \[d\] are prominent actors in these tales, where
> they take the place of the Persian Peries and Deevs, we will here give
> some account of them.

> According to Arabian writers, there is a species of beings named Jinn
> or Jan (Jinnee *m.,* Jinniyeh *f. sing.*), which were created and
> occupied the earth several thousand years before Adam. A tradition
> from the Prophet says that they were formed of "smokeless fire,"
> *i.e.* the fire of the wind Simoom. They were governed by a succession
> of forty, or, as others say, seventy-two monarchs, named Suleyman, the
> last of whom, called Jan-ibn-Jan, built the Pyramids of Egypt.
> Prophets were sent from time to time to instruct and admonish them;
> but on their continued disobedience, an army of angels appeared, who
> drove them from the earth to the regions of the islands, making many
> prisoners, and slaughtering many more. Among the prisoners, was a
> young Jinnee, named 'Azazeel, or El-Harith (afterwards called Iblees,
> from his *despair),* who grew up among the angels, and became at last
> their chief. When Adam was created, God commanded the angels to
> worship him; and they all obeyed except Iblees, who, for his
> disobedience, was tuned into a Sheytan or Devil, and he became the
> father of the Sheytans.\[e\]

> The Jinn are not immortal; they are to survive mankind, but to die
> before the general resurrection. Even at present many of them are
> slain by other Jinn, or by men; but chiefly by shooting-stars hurled
> at them from Heaven. The fire of which they were created, circulates
> in their veins instead of blood, and when they receive a mortal wound,
> it bursts forth and consumes them to ashes. They eat and drink, and
> propagate their species. Sometimes they unite with human beings, and
> the offspring partakes of the nature of both parents. Some of the Jinn
> are obedient to the will of God, and believers in the Prophet,
> answering to the Peries of the Persians; others are like the Deevs,
> disobedient and malignant. Both kinds are divided into communities,
> and ruled over by princes. They have the power to make themselves
> visible and invisible at pleasure. They can assume the form of various
> animals, especially those of serpents, cats, and dogs. When they
> appear in the human form, that of the good Jinnee is usually of great
> beauty; that of the evil one, of hideous deformity, and sometimes of
> gigantic size.

> When the Zôba'ah, a whirlwind that raises the sand in the form of a
> pillar of tremendous height, is seen sweeping over the desert, the
> Arabs, who believe it to be caused by the flight of an evil Jinnee,
> cry, Iron! Iron! *(Hadeed! Hadeed!)* or Iron! thou unlucky one!
> *(Hadeed! ya meshoom!)* of which metal the Jinn are believed to have a
> great dread. Or else they cry, God is most great! *(Allahu akbar!)*
> They do the same when they see a water-spout at sea; for they assign
> the same cause to its origin. \[f\]

> The chief abode of the Jinn of both kinds is the Mountains of Kaf,
> already described. But they also are dispersed through the earth, and
> they occasionally take up their residence in baths, wells, latrinae,
> ovens, and. ruined houses. \[g\]

> They also frequent the sea and rivers, cross-roads, and market-places.
> They ascend at times to the confines of the lowest heaven, and by
> listening there to the conversation of the angels, they obtain some
> knowledge of futurity, which they impart to those men who, by means of
> talismans or magic arts, have been able to reduce them to obedience.
> \[h\]

> The following are anecdotes of the Jinn, given by historians of
> eminence. \[i\]

> It is related, says El-Kasweenee, by a certain narrator of traditions,
> that he descended into a valley with his sheep, and a wolf carried off
> a ewe from among them; and he arose and raised his voice, and cried,
> "O inhabitant of the valley!" whereupon he heard a voice saying, "O
> wolf, restore him his sheep!" and the wolf came with the ewe and left
> her, and departed.

> Ben Shohnah relates, that in the year 456 of the Hejra, in the reign
> of Kaiem, the twenty-sixth khaleefeh of the house of Abbas, a report
> was raised in Bagdad, which immediately spread throughout the whole
> province of Irak, that some Turks being out hunting saw in the desert
> a black tent, beneath which there was a number of people of both
> sexes, who were beating their cheeks, and uttering loud cries, as is
> the custom in the East when any one is dead. Amidst their cries they
> heard these words--*The* *great king of the Jinn is dead, woe to this
> country!* and then there came out a great troop of women, followed by
> a number of other rabble, who proceeded to a neighbouring cemetery,
> still beating themselves in token of grief and mourning.

> The celebrated historian Ebn Athir relates, that when he was at Mosul
> on the Tigris, in the year 600 of the Hejra, there was in that country
> an epidemic disease of the throat; and it was said that a woman, of
> the race of the Jinn, having lost her son, all those who did not
> condole with her on account of his death were attacked with that
> disease; so that to be cured of it men and women assembled, and with
> all their strength cried out,
>
> O mother of Ankood, excuse us! Ankood is dead, and we did not mind it!

> \[a\] compare Antar and the Suspended Poems (translated by Sir W*.*
