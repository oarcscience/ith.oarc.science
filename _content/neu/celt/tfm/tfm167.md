LORD NANN AND THE KORRIGAN

>  

> The Lord Nann and his bride so fair  
> In early youth united were,  
> In early youth divided were.

> The lady lay-in yesternight  
> Of twins, their skin as snow was white,  
> A boy and girl, that glad his sight.

> "What doth thy heart desire, loved one,  
> For giving me so fair a son?  
> Say, and at once it shall be done.

> "A woodcock from the pool of the glyn,  
> Or roebuck from the forest green?

> "The roebuck's flesh is savoury,  
> But for it thou to the wood should'st hie."

> Lord Nann when he these words did hear,  
> He forthwith grasped his oaken spear,

> And vaulting on his coal-black steed  
> Unto the green-wood hied with speed.

> When he unto the wood drew nigh,  
> A fair white doe he there did spy,

> And after her such chase he made,  
> The ground it shook beneath their tread.

> And after her such chase made he,  
> From his brows the water copiously

> And from his horse's sides ran down.  
> The evening had now come on,

> And he came where a streamlet flowed  
> Fast by a Korrigan's abode;

> And grassy turf spread all around.  
> To quench his thirst he sprang to ground.

> The Korrig at her fount sat there  
> A-combing of her long fair hair.

> She combed it with a comb of gold--  
> These ladies ne'er are poor, we 're told.

> "Rash man," cried she, "how dost thou dare  
> To come disturb my waters fair!

> "Thou shalt unto me plight thy fay,  
> Or seven years thou shalt waste away,  
> Or thou shalt die ere the third day."

> "To thee my faith plight will I ne'er,  
> For I am married now a year.

> "I shall not surely waste away,  
> Nor shall I die ere the third day;

> "I shall not die within three days,  
> But when it unto God shall please."--

> "Good mother, mine, if you love me,  
> See that my bed made ready be,  
> For I have ta'en a malady.

> "Let not one word to my wife be told;  
> In three days I shall lie in the mould,  
> A Korrigan has thus foretold."

> And when three days were past and gone,  
> The young wife asked this question,--

> "My mother-in-law, now tell me why  
> The bells all ring thus constantly?

> "And why the priests a low mass sing,  
> All clad in white, as the bells ring?"

> "Last night a poor man died whom we  
> A lodging gave through charity."

> "My mother-in-law, tell me, I pray,  
> My Lord Nann whither is he gone away?"

> "My daughter, to the town he 'a gone,  
> To see thee he will come anon."

> "Good mother-in-law, to church to fare,  
> Shall I my red or blue gown wear?"

> "The custom now is, daughter dear,  
> At church always in black to appear."

> As they crossed o'er the churchyard-wall,  
> On her husband's grave her eye did fall.

> "Who is now dead of our family,  
> That thus fresh dug our ground I see?"

> "Alas! my child, the truth can l  
> Not hide: thy husband there doth lie."

> On her two knees herself she cast  
> And rose no more, she breathed her last.

> It was a marvel to see, men say,  
> The night that followed the *day,  
> *The lady in earth by her lord lay,

> To see two oak-trees themselves rear  
> From the new-made grave into the air;

> And on their branches two doves white,  
> Who there were hopping gay and light;

> Which sang when rose the morning-ray  
> And then toward heaven sped away.

> This ballad is very remarkable. Its similarity to that of Sir Olaf, so
> celebrated in Scandinavia, and of which we have already given two
> variations out of fifteen, must strike every one; in its concluding
> stanzas also it resembles other Scandinavian and English ballads. On
> the other hand, the White Doe and the Korrigan at the fount remind us
> of the Lais of Marie de France. Our opinion on the whole is, that the
> ballad belongs to Scandinavia, whence it was brought at an early
> period--by the Normans, we might say only for its Christian air in
> both countries--and naturalised in the usual manner. It is rather
> strange that there is neither an English nor a Scottish version of it.

> The next lay, which is entirely composed in tercets, is the story of a
> changeling. In order to recover her own child the mother is advised by
> the Virgin, to whom she has prayed, to prepare a meal for ten
> farm-servants in an eggshell, which will make the Korrid speak, and
> she is then to whip him well till he cries, and when he does so he
> will be taken away. The woman does as directed: the Korr asks what she
> is about: she tells him: "For ten, dear mother, in an eggshell! I have
> seen the egg before I saw the white hen: I have seen the acorn before
> I saw the tree: I have seen the acorn and I have seen the shoot: I
> have seen the oak in the wood of Brézal, but never saw I such a thing
> as this." "Thou hast seen too many things, my son," replied she, and
> began to whip him, when one came crying, "Don't beat him, give him
> back to me; I have not done yours any injury. He is king in our
> country." When the woman went home she found her own child sleeping
> sweetly in the cradle. He opened his eyes and said, "Ah! mother, I
> have been a long time asleep!"

> Among the Welsh legends above related, that of the Fairies Banished
> has some resemblance to this; but M. Villemarqué says that he was told
> a changeling-story by the Glamorgan peasantry, precisely the same as
> the Breton legend. In it the changeling is heard muttering to himself
> in a cracked voice, "I have seen the acorn before I saw the oak: I
> have seen the egg before I saw the white hen: I have never seen the
> like of this." It is remarkable that these words form a rimed triad or
> tercet nearly the same with that in the Breton ballad, \[a\] whence M.
> Villemarqué is led to suspect that the legend is anterior to the
> seventh century, the epoch of the separation of the Britons of Wales
> and Armorica. But as changelings seem to have come from the North, we
> cannot consent to receive this theory. He also quotes from Geoffrey of
> Monmouth's Life of Merlin, "There is in this forest," said Merlin the
> Wild, "an oak laden with years: I saw it when it was beginning to
> grow... I saw the acorn whence it rose, germinate and become a twig...
> I have then lived a long time." This would, in our opinion, tend to
> show that this was an ordinary formula in the British language.

> The third, and last of those ballads tells, and not without humour,
> how Paskou-Hir, *i. e.,* Long-Paskou, the tailor, one Friday evening,
> entered the abode of the Korred, and there dug up and carried, home a
> concealed treasure. They pursued him, and came into the court-yard
> dancing with might and main, and singing,--

> Dilun, dimeurs, dimerc'her  
> Ha diriaou, ha digwoner.

> Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  
> And Thursday, and Friday.

> Funding the door secured \[b\] they mount the roof and break a hole
> through which they get in, and resume their dance on the floor, still
> singing, Monday, Tuesday, etc., and calling on the tailor to come and.
> join them and they would teach him a dance that would crack his
> back-bone, and they end by telling him that the money of the Korr is
> good for nothing.

> Another version says, that it was a baker who stole the treasure, and,
> more cunning than the tailor, be strewed the floor of his house with
> hot ashes and cinders on which the Korred burned their feet. This made
> them scamper off, but before they went they smashed all his crockery
> and earthenware. Their words were, "In Iannik-ann-Trevou's house we
> burnt our horny feet and made a fine mess of his crockery."

> The following legend will explain the song of the Korred.

> Gweliz mez ken gwelet derven,  
> Gweliz vi ken gwelet iar wenn,

> \[b\] The tailor cries "Shut the door! Here are the little *Duz* of
> the night" *(Setu ann Duizigou nouz),* and St. Augustine (De Civ. Dei,
> c. xxiii.) speaks of "Daemones quos *Duscios* Galli nuncupant." It may
