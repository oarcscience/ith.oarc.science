THE NIS AND THE BOY

 

> THERE was a Nis in a house in Jutland; he every evening got his groute
> at the regular time, and he, in return, used to help both the men and
> the maids, and looked to the interest of the master of the house in
> every respect.

> There came one time an arch mischievous boy to live at service in this
> house, and his great delight was, whenever he got an opportunity, to
> give the Nis all the annoyance in his power. One evening, late, when
> everything was quiet in the place, the Nis took his little wooden
> dish, and was just going to eat his supper, when he perceived that the
> boy had put the butter at the bottom, and concealed it, in hopes that
> he might eat the groute first, and then find the butter when all the
> groute was gone. He accordingly set about thinking how he might repay
> the boy in kind; so, after pondering a little, he went up to the loft,
> where the man and the boy were lying asleep in the same bed. When he
> had taken the bed-clothes off them, and saw the little boy by the side
> of the tall man, he said, "Short and long don't match;" and with this
> word he took the boy by the legs and dragged him down to the man's
> legs. He then went up to the head of the bed, and "Short and long
> don't match," said he again, and then he dragged the boy up once more.
> When, do what he would, he could not succeed in making the boy as long
> as the man, he still persisted in dragging him up and down in the bed,
> and continued at this work the whole night long, till it was broad
> daylight.

> By this time he was well tired, so he crept up on the window-stool,
> and sat with his legs hanging down into the yard. But the
> house-dog--for all dogs have a great enmity to the Nis--as soon as he
> saw him, began to bark at him, which afforded such amusement to Nis,
> as the dog could not get up to him, that he put down first one leg and
> then the other to him, and teazed him, and kept saying, "Look at my
> little leg! look at my little leg!" In the meantime the boy had
> wakened, and had stolen up close behind him, and while Nis was least
> thinking of it, and was going on with his "Look at my little leg!" the
> boy tumbled him down into the yard to the dog, crying out at the same
> time, "Look at the whole of him now!"
