THE FAIRY NURSELING

>   
>   
> A COTTAGER and his wife residing at Nether Witton were one day visited
> by a *fary* and his spouse with their young child, which they wished
> to leave in their charge. The cottager agreed to take care of the
> child for a certain period when it had to be taken thence. The fary
> gave the man a box of ointment with which to anoint the child's eyes;
> but he had not on any account to touch himself with it, or some
> misfortune would befal him. For a long time he and. his wife were
> 'very careful to avoid the dangerous unction; but one day when his
> wife was out curiosity over-came his prudence, and he anointed his
> eyes without any noticeable effect; but after a while, when walking
> through Long Horsley Fair, he met the male fary and accosted him. He
> started back in amazement at the recognition; but instantly guessing
> the truth, blew on the eyes of the cottager, and instantly blinded
> him. The child was never more seen.
