PIXY-VENGENCE

>  

> Two serving-girls in Tavistock said that the Pixies were very kind to
> them, and used to drop silver for them into a bucket of fair water
> which they took care to place for them in the chimney-nook every
> night. Once it was forgotten, and the Pixies forthwith came up to the
> girls' room, and loudly complained of the neglect. One of them, who
> happened to be awake, jogged the other, and proposed going down to
> rectify the omission, but she said, "for her part she would not stir
> out of bed to please all the pixies in Devonshire." The other went
> down and filled the bucket, in which, by the way, she found next
> morning a handfull of silver pennies. As she was returning, she heard
> the Pixies debating about what they would do to punish the other.
> Various modes were proposed and rejected; at last it was agreed to
> give her a lame leg for a term of seven years, then to be cured by an
> herb growing on Dartmoor, whose name of seven syllables was pronounced
> in a clear and audible tone. This the girl tried by every known means
> to fix in her memory. But when she awoke in the morning, it was gone,
> and she could only tell that Molly was to be lame for seven years, and
> then be cured by an herb with a strange name. As for Molly, she arose
> dead lame, and so she continued till the end of the period, when one
> day, as she was picking up a mushroom, a strange-looking boy started
> up and insisted on *striking* her leg with a plant which he held in
> his hand. He did so, and she was cured and became the best dancer in
> the town.
