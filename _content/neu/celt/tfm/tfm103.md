AID AND PUNISHMENT

>   
>   
> ON the side of Mount Pilatus is a place named the Kastler-Alpe, now
> covered with stones and rubbish, but which once was verdant and
> fertile. The cause of the change was as follows.

> The land there was formerly occupied by a farmer, a churlish,
> unfeeling man, who, though wealthy, let his only sister struggle with
> the greatest poverty in the valley beneath. The poor woman at length
> having fallen sick, and seeing no other resource, resolved to apply to
> her hardhearted brother for the means of employing a doctor. She sent
> her daughter to him; but all the prayers and tears of the poor girl
> failed to move him, and he told her he would, sooner than give her
> anything, see the Alpe covered with stones and rubbish. She departed,
> and as she went along a Dwarf suddenly appeared to her. She would have
> fled, but he gently detained her, and telling her he had heard all
> that had passed, gave her a parcel of herbs, which he assured her
> would cure her mother, and a little cheese, which he said would last
> them a long time.

> On trial, the herbs quickly produced the promised effect; and when
> they went to cut the cheese they found the knife would not penetrate
> it, and no wonder, for it was pure gold. There also came a sudden
> storm on the mountain, and the Kastler-Alpe was reduced to its present
> eondition. \[a\]
