THE WONDERFUL LITTLE POUCH

>   
> AT NOON one day a young peasant sat by the side of a wood, and,
> sighing, prayed to God to give him a morsel of food. A Dwarf suddenly
> emerged from the wood, and told him that his prayer should be
> fulfilled. He then gave him the pouch that he had on his side, with
> the assurance that he would always find in it wherewithal to satisfy
> his thirst and hunger, charging him at the same time not to consume it
> all and to share with any one who asked him for food. The Dwarf
> vanished, and the peasant put his hand into the pouch to make trial of
> it, and there he found a cake of new bread, a cheese, and a bottle of
> wine, on which he made a hearty meal. He then saw that the pouch
> swelled up as before, and looking in be found that it was again full
> of bread, cheese, and wine. He now felt sure of his food, and he lived
> on in an idle luxurious way, without doing any work. One day, as he
> was gorging himself there came up to him a feeble old man, who prayed
> him to give him a morsel to eat. He refused in a brutal, churlish
> tone, when instantly the bread and cheese broke, and scattered out of
> his hands, and pouch and all vanished. \[a\]
