AINSEL and PUCK

>   
>   
> A WIDOW and her son, a little boy, lived, together in a cottage in or
> near the village of Rothley, Northumberland. One winter's evening the
> child refused to go to bed with his mother, as he wished to sit up for
> a while longer, "for," said he, "I am not sleepy." The mother finding
> remonstrance in vain, at last told him that if he sat up by himself
> the faries would most certainly come and take him away. The boy
> laughed as his mother went to bed, leaving him sitting by the fire; he
> had not been there long, watching the fire and enjoying its cheerful
> warmth, till a beautiful little figure, about the size of a child's
> doll, descended the chimney and alighted on the hearth! The little
> fellow was somewhat startled at first, but its prepossessing smile as
> it paced to and fro before him soon overcame his fears, and he
> inquired familiarly, "What do they ca' thou?" "Ainsel," answered the
> little thing haughtily, at the same time retorting the question, "And
> what do they ca' *thou?" "My* ainsel'," answered the boy; and they
> commenced playing together like two children newly acquainted. Their
> gambols continued quite innocently until the fire began to grow dim;
> the boy then took up the poker to stir it, when a hot cinder
> accidentally fell upon the foot of his playmate; her tiny voice was
> instantly raised to a most terrific roar, and the boy had scarcely
> time to crouch into the bed behind his mother, before the voice of the
> old fary-mother was heard shouting, "Who's done it? 'Who's done it?"
> "Oh! it was my ainsel!" answered the daughter. "Why, then," said the
> mother, as she kicked her up the chimney, "what 's all this noise for:
> there's nyon *(i.e.* no one) to blame."

>  

> Such is the sum of what we have been able to collect respecting the
> popular fairy-lore of England, the largest and most complete
> collection that, to our knowledge, has ever been made. We might
> venture to add that little more is ever likely to be collected, for
> the sounds of the cotton-mill, the steam-engine, and, more than all,
> the whistle of the railway train, more powerful than any exorcists,
> have banished, or soon will banish, the fairy tribes from all their
> accustomed haunts, and their name and their exploits will in future be
> found in works like the present rather than in village tradition.

> As the merry spirit, Puck, is so prominent an actor in the scenes
> forming our next division, this may be deemed no unfitting place for
> the consideration of his various appellations; such as Puck, Robin
> Good-fellow, Robin Hood, Hobgoblin.

> Puck is evidently the same with the old word *Pouke,* \[a\] the
> original meaning of which would seem to be devil, demon, or evil
> spirit. We first meet with it in the Vision of Piers Ploughman, where
> it undoubtedly signifies 'the grand adversary of God and man.'

> When, in this poem, \[b\] the Seer beholds Abraham, the
> personification of Faith, with his "wide clothes," within which lay a
> Lazar,

> Amonges patriarkes and prophetes,  
> Pleying togideres,

> and asks him what was there,

> Loo! quod he, and leet me see.                                 Ne no
> buyrn be oure borgh,  
> Lord mercy! I seide;                                                 
> Ne bringe us from his daunger;  
> This is a present of muche pris,                                 Out
> of the *pouke pondfold  
> *What prynce shal it have?                                         No
> maynprise may us fecche,  
> It is a precious present, quod he,                                Til
> he come that I carpe of,  
> Ac the *pouke* it hath attached,                                    
> Crist is his name,  
> And me theremyde, quod that                                     That
> shall delivere us som day  
> man,                                                                        
> Out of the *develes* power.  
> May no wed us quyte,

> Golding also must have understood Pooke in the sense of devil, when in
> the ninth book of his translation of Ovid, unauthorised however by the
> original, he applies it to the Chimaera,

> The country where Chymsara, that same *pooke  
> *Hath goatish body, lion's head and brist, and dragon's tayle.

> Spenser employs the word, and he clearly distinguishes it from
> hob-goblin:

> Ne let housefires nor lightnings helpless harms,  
> Ne let the *pouke* \[c\] nor other evil sprites,  
> Ne let mischievous witches with their charms,  
> No let *hob-goblins,* names whom sense we see not,  
> Fray us with things that be not--*Epithalamion,* v. 340.

> These terms are also distinguished in the poem named The Scourge of
> Venus:

> And that they may perceive the heavens frown,  
> The *poukes* and *goblins* pull the coverings down.

> In Ben Jonson's play of The Devil is an Ass, the unlucky fiend who
> gives origin to its name is called Pug, and in the same author's Sad
> Shepherd the personage named Puck-hairy is, as Gifford justly
> observes, "not the Fairy or Oriental Puck, though often confounded
> with him." \[d\] In truth, it is first in Shakespeare that we find
> Puck confounded with the House-spirit, and having those traits of
> character which are now regarded as his very essence, and have caused
> his name Pug to be given to the agile mischievous monkey, and to a
> kind of little dog.

> We will now discuss the origin of this far-famed appellation and its
> derivation.

> In the Slavonic tongues, which are akin to the Teutonic, *Bôg* is God,
> and there are sleights of etymology which would identify the two
> terms; the Icelandic Puki is an evil spirit, and such we have seen was
> the English Pouke, which easily became Puck, Pug, and Bug; finally, in
> Friesland the Kobold is called Puk, and in old German we meet with
> Putt or Butz as the name of a being not unlike the original English
> Puck.\[e\] The Devonshire fairies are called Pixies, and the Irish
> have their Pooka, and the Welsh their Pwcca, both derived from Pouke
> or Puck. From Bug comes the Scottish Bogle, (which Gawin Douglas
> expressly distinguishes from the Brownie) and the Yorkshire Boggart.
> \[f\] The Swedish language has the terms *spöka, spöke;* the Danish
> *spöge, spögelse,* the German, *spuken, spuk,* all used of spirits or
> ghosts, and their apparitions. Perhaps the Scottish *pawkey,* sly,
> knowing, may belong to the same family of words. Akin to Bogle was the
> old English term Puckle, noticed above, which is still retained in the
> sense of mischievous, as in Peregrine Pickle and Little Pickle. It has
> been conjectured \[g\] that *Picklehäring,* the German term for zany
> or merry-andrew, may have been properly *Picklehärin, i.e.* the hairy
> sprite, answering to Jonson<sup>1</sup>s Puck-hairy, and that he may
> have worn a vesture of hair or leaves to be rough like the Brownie and
> kindred beings.

> From Bug also come Bugbear, and Bugleboo, or Bugaboo. They owe their
> origin probably to the Ho! Ho! Ho! given to Puck or Robin Goodfellow,
> as it was to the Devil *(i.e.,* Pouke) in the Mysteries. Bull-beggar
> may be only a corruption of Bugbear. \[h\]

> The following passage from a writer of the present day proves that in
> some places the idea of Puck as a spirit haunting the woods and fields
> is still retained. "The peasantry" says Mr. Allies, \[i\] "of Alfrick
> and those parts of Worcestershire, say that they are sometimes what
> they call *Poake-ledden,* that is, that they are occasionally waylaid
> in the night by a mischievous sprite whom they call Poake, who leads
> them into ditches, bogs, pools, and. other such scrapes, and then sets
> up a loud laugh and leaves them quite bewildered in the lurch." This
> is what in Devon is called being *Pixy-led.* We may observe the
> likeness here to the Puck of Shakspeare and Drayton, who were both
> natives of the adjoining county.

> A further proof perhaps of Puck's rural and extern character is the
> following rather trifling circumstance. An old name of the fungus
> named *puffball* is *puck-fist*, which is plainly Puck's-fist, and not
> *puff-fist* as Nares conjectured; for its Irish name is
> *Cos-a-Phooka,* or Pooka's-foot, *i.e.,* Puck's-foot. We will add by
> the way, that the Anglo-Saxon, Wolf's-fist, is rendered in the
> dictionaries toadstool, mushroom, and we cannot help suspecting that
> as wolf and elf were sometimes confounded, and wolf and fist are, in
> fact, incompatible terms, this was originally Elf's-fist, and that the
> mushrooms meant were not the thick ugly toadstools, the "grislie
> todestooles," of Spenser, but those delicate fungi called in Ireland
> *fairy-mushrooms* and which perhaps in England also were ascribed to
> the fairies. \[j\]

> So much then for Puck; we will now consider some other terms.

> Robin Goodfellow, of whom we have given above a full account, is
> evidently a domestic spirit, answering in name and character to the
> Nisse God-dreng of Scandinavia, the Knecht Ruprecht, *i.e.,* Robin of
> Germany. He seems to unite in his person the Boggart and Barguest of
> Yorkshire.

> Hob-goblin is, as we have seen, another name of the same spirit.
> Goblin is the French *gobelin,* German Kobold; Hob is Rob, Robin, Bob;
> just as Hodge is Roger. We still have the proper names Hobbs, Hobson,
> like Dix, Dixon, Wills, Wilson; by the way, Hick, *i. e.* Dick, from
> Richard, still remains in Hicks, Hickson.

> Robin Hood, though we can produce no instance of it, must, we think,
> also have been an appellation of this spirit, and been given to the
> famed outlaw of merry Sherwood, from his sportive character and his
> abiding in the recesses of the greenwood. The hood is a usual
> appendage of the domestic spirit.

> Roguery and sportiveness are, we may see, the characteristics of this
> spirit. Hence it may have been that the diminutives of proper names
> were given to him, and even to the Ignis Fatuus, which in a country
> like England, that was in general dry and free from sloughs and
> bog-holes, was mischievous rather than dangerous. \[k\] But this seems
> to have been a custom of our forefathers, for we find the devil
> himself called Old Nick, and Old Davy is the sailor's familiar name
> for Death.

> <span id="img_11"></span> ![](img/p11.jpg)

> In the Midsummer Night's Dream the fairy says to Puck "Thou Lob of
> spirits;*"* Milton has the *lubber-fiend,* and Fletcher says, \[l\]
> "There is a pretty tale of a witch that had a giant to be her son that
> was called Lob Lie-by-the-fire." This might lead us to suppose that
> *Lob,* whence *loby* (looby), *lubbard, lubber,* \[m\] and adding the
> diminutive *kin,* Lubberkin, a name of one of the clowns in Gay's
> Pastorals, was an original name of some kind of spirit. We shall
> presently see that the Irish name of the Leprechaun is actually
> Lubberkin. As to the origin of the name we have little to say, but it
> may have had a sense the very opposite of the present one of *lubber,*
> and have been connected with the verb *to leap.* \[n\] Grimm \[o\]
> tells of a spirit named the Good Lubber, to whom the bones of animals
> used to be offered at Mansfield in Germany; but we see no resemblance
> between him and our Lob of spirits; we might rather trace a connexion
> with the French Lutin, Lubin. \[p\] The phrase of *being in* or
> *getting into Lob's Pound* (like the "Pouke's pondfold,") is easy of
> explanation, if we suppose Lob to be a sportive spirit. it is
> equivalent to being *Poake-ledden* or
>
> Pixy-led.

> Wight, answering to the German *Wicht,* seems to have been used in the
> time of Chaucer for elf or fairy, most probably for such as haunted
> houses, or it may have had the signification of *witch,* which is
> evidently another form of it. In the Miller's Tale the carpenter says,

> I crouchè thee from elves and from
>
> wights.

> And

> Jesu Crist, and Seint Benedight,  
> Blisse this house from every wicked *wight.* \[q\]

> Urchin is a term which, like *elf* and such like, we still apply to
> children, but which seems formerly to have been one of the
> appellations of the fairies. Reginald Scott, as we have seen, places
> it in his list, and we find it in the following places of the poets:

> Urchins

> Shall for the vast of night that they may work  
> All exercise on *thee.--Tempest,* i. 2.

>                             His spirits hear me,  
>             And yet I needs must curse; but they'll not pinch  
>             Fright me with *urchin-shows,* pitch me i' the mire,  
>             Nor lead me like a fire-brand in the dark  
>             Out of my way, unless he bid *'em.--lb.* ii. 2.

> Like *urchins,* ouphs, and fairies.

> Merry Wives of Windsor, iv. 4.  
>  

> Elves, *urchins,* goblins all, and little fairyes.

> Mad Pranks, etc., p.38.

>   
> Great store of goblins, fairies, bugs, nightmares,  
> *Urchins,* and elves, to many a house repairs.

> Old Poem, in Brand, ii. 514.

>   
> Trip it, litttle *urchins* all.

> Maid's Metamorphosis.

> Helping all *urchin-blasts* and ill-luck signs,  
> That the shrewd meddling elfe delights to make.

> Comas, 845.

>   
> Urchin is a hedgehog, as Stevens has justly observed,\[r\] and in
> these lines of Titus Andronicus (ii. 3.)

> A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,  
> Ten thousand swelling toads, as many
>
> urchins,

> it probably has this sense. We still call the *echinus marinus* the
> Sea-urchin. Still as we have no analogy, but rather the contrary, for
> transferring the name of an animal to the elves, we feel inclined to
> look for a different origin of the term as applied to these beings.
> The best or rather only hypothesis we have met with \[s\] is that
> which finds it in the hitherto unexplained word *Orcneas* in Beówulf
> which may have been *Orcenas,* and if, as we have supposed \[t\] the
> Anglo-Saxons sometimes pronounced *c* before *e* and *i* in the
> Italian manner, we should have, if needed, the exact word. We would
> also notice the old German *urkinde,* which Grimm renders *nanus.*
> \[u\]

> We now come to the poets.

> In Beówulf, an Anglo-Saxon poem, supposed not to be later than the
> seventh century, we meet with the following verse,

> "Eotenas, and Ylfe,  
> And Orcneas."

> The first of these words is evidently the same as the Iötunn or Giants
> of the northern mythology; the second is as plainly its Alfar, and we
> surely may be excused for supposing that the last may be the same as
> its Duergar.

> Layamon, in the twelfth century, in his poetic paraphrase of Wace's
> Brut, \[v\] thus expands that poet's brief notice of the birth of
> Arthur:

> "Ertur son nom; de sa bunte  
> Ad grant parole puis este."  
> So soon he came on earth,  
> Elves received him.  
> They enchanted that child  
> With magic most strong.  
> They gave him might  
> To be the best of all knights.  
> They gave him another king.  
> They gave him the third  
> That he should long live.  
> They gave to that kingly child  
> Virtues most good.  
> That he was most generous  
> Of all men alive.  
> This the Elves him gave,  
> vv 19254: *seq*.

> If we have made any discovery of importance in the department of
> romantic literature, it is our identification of Ogier le Danois with
> the Eddaic Helgi. \[w\] We have shown among other points of
> resemblance, that as the Norns were at the birth of the one, so the
> Fées were at that of the other. With this circumstance Layamon was
> apparently acquainted, and when he wished to transfer it to Arthur as
> the Norns were no longer known and the Fées had not yet risen into
> importance, there only remained for him to employ the Elves, which had
> not yet acquired tiny dimensions. Hence then we see that the progress
> was Norns, Elves, Fées, and these last held their place in the
> subsequent Fairy tales of France and Italy.

> These potent Elves are still superior to the popular Fairies which we
> first met with in Chaucer.

> Yet nothing in the passages in which he speaks of them leads to the
> inference of his conceiving them to be of a diminutive stature. His
> notions, indeed, on the subject seem very vague and unsettled; and
> there is something like a confusion of the Elves and Fairies of
> Romance, as the following passages will show:--

> The Wife of Bathes Tale is evidently a Fairy tale. It thus commences:

> In oldê dayès of the king Artoúr,  
> Of which that Bretons speken gret honoúr,  
> All was this lond fulfilled of faerie; \[x\]  
> The Elf-quene with her joly compagnie,  
> Danced ful oft in many a grenè mede.  
> This was the old opinion as I rede;  
> I speke of many hundred yeres ago.  
> But now can no man see non elvès mo,  
> For now the gretè charitee and prayéres  
> Of limitoures, and other holy freres,  
> That serchen every land and every streme,  
> As thikke as motes in the sonnè-beme,  
> Blissing halles, chambres, kichenès, and boures,  
> Citees and burghès, castles highe, and toures,  
> Thropès \[y\] and bernès, shepenes and dairiés,  
> This maketh that there ben no faëries;  
> For there as wont to walken was an elf,  
> There walketh now the limitour himself,  
> In undermelès, \[z\] and in morweninges,  
> And sayth his matines and his holy thinges,  
> As he goth in his limitatioun.  
> Women may now go safely up and down;  
> In every bush and under every tree  
> There is none other incubus but he,  
> And he ne will don hem no dishonoúr.

> The Fairies therefore form a part of the tale, and they are thus
> introduced:

> The day was come that homward must he turne;  
> And in his way it happed him to ride,  
> In all his care, under a forest side,  
> Wheras he saw upon a dancè go  
> Of ladies foure and twenty, and yet mo:  
> Toward this ilke dance he drow ful yerne,  
> In hope that he som wisdom shuldè lerne;  
> But certainly, er he came fully there,  
> Yvanished was this dance, he n'iste not wher;  
> No creäture saw he that barè lif,  
> Save on the grene he saw sitting a wif,  
> A fouler wight ther may no man devise.

> These ladies bear a great resemblance to the Elle-maids of
> Scandinavia. We need hardly inform our readers that this "foul wight"
> becomes the knight's deliverer from the imminent danger he is in, and
> that, when he has been forced to marry her, she is changed into a
> beautiful young maiden. But who or what she was the poet sayeth not.

> In the Marchantes Tale we meet the Faerie attendant on Pluto and
> Proserpina, their king and queen, a sort of blending of classic and
> Gothic mythology:

> for to tell

> The beautee of the gardin, and the well  
> That stood under a laurer alway grene;  
> Ful often time he Pluto, and his quene  
> Proserpina, and alle hir faerie \[aa\]  
> Disporten hem, and maken melodie  
> About that well, and daunced, as men told.

> Again, in the same Tale:

> And so befel in that bright morwe tide,  
> That, in the gardin, on the ferther side,  
> Pluto, that is the king of Faerie,  
> And many a ladye in his compagnie,  
> Folwing his wif, the quene Proserpina,  
> Which that he ravisshed out of Ethná,  
> While that she gadred floures in the mede,  
> (In Claudian ye may the story rede,  
> How that hire in his grisely carte he fette);  
> This king of Faërie adoun him sette  
> Upon a benche of turvès, fresh and grene.

>  

> ... to be continued ...

>  

> In the conversation which ensues between these august personages,
> great knowledge of Scripture is displayed; and the queen, speaking, of
> the "sapient prince," passionately exclaims--

> I setè nat of all the vilanie  
> That he of women wrote a boterflie;  
> I am a woman nedès moste I speke,  
> Or swell unto that time min hertè breke.

> Some might suspect a mystery in the queen's thus emphatically styling
> herself a woman, but we lay no stress upon it, as Faire Damoselle
> Pertelote, the hen, who was certainly less entitled to it, does the
> same.

> In the Man of Lawes Tale the word Elfe is employed, but whether as
> equivalent to witch or fairy is doubtful.

> This lettre spake, the quene delivered was  
> Of so horrible a fendliche creäture,  
> That in the castle, non so hardy was,  
> That any whilè dorste therein endure.  
> The mother was an *elfe* by áventure,  
> Y come, by charmès or by sorcerie,  
> And everich man hateth hire conlpagnie. \[ab\]

> The Rime of Sir Thopas has been already considered as belonging to
> romance.

> It thus appears that the works of manners-painting Chaucer give very
> little information respecting the popular belief in Fairies of his
> day. Were it not for the sly satire of the passage, we might be apt to
> suspect that, like one who lived away from the common people, he was
> willing to represent the superstition as extinct--" But now can no man
> see non elves mo." The only trait that he gives really characteristic
> of the popular elves is their love of dancing.

> In the poets that intervene between Chaucer and the Maiden Reign, we
> do not recollect to have noticed anything of importance respecting
> Fairies, except the employment, already adverted to, of that term, and
> that of Elves, by translators in rendering the Latin *Nymphae.* Of the
> size of these beings, the passages in question give no information.

> But in Elizabeth's days, "Fairies," as Johnson observes, "were much in
> fashion; common tradition had made them familiar, and Spenser's poem
> had made them great." A just remark, no doubt, though Johnson fell
> into the common error of identifying Spenser's Fairies with the
> popular ones.

> The three first books of the Faerie Queene were published in 1590,
> and, as Warton remarks, Fairies became a familiar and fashionable
> machinery with the poets and poetasters. Shakspeare, well acquainted,
> from the rural habits of his early life, with the notions of the
> peasantry respecting these beings, and highly gifted with the
> prescient power of genius, saw clearly how capable they were of being
> applied to the production of a species of the wonderful, as pleasing,
> or perhaps even more so, than the classic gods; and in the
> Midsummer-Night's Dream he presented them in combination with the
> heroes and heroines of the mythic age of Greece. But what cannot the
> magic wand of genius effect? We view with undisturbed delight the
> Elves of Gothic mythology sporting in the groves of Attica,, the
> legitimate haunts of Nymphs and Satyrs.

> Shakspeare, having the Faerie Queene before his eyes, seems to have
> attempted a blending of the Elves of the village with the Fays of
> romance. His Fairies agree with the former in their diminutive
> stature,--diminished, indeed, to dimensions inappreciable by village
> gossips,--in their fondness for dancing, their love of cleanliness,
> and their child-abstracting propensities. Like the Fays, they form a
> community, ruled over by the princely Oberon and the fair Titania.
> \[ac\] There is a court and chivalry: Oberon would have the queen's
> sweet changeling to be a "Knight of his train to trace the forest
> wild." Like earthly monarchs, he has his jester, "the shrewd and
> knavish sprite, called Robin Good-fellow."

> The luxuriant imagination of the poet seemed to exult in pouring forth
> its wealth in the production of these new actors on the mimic scene,
> and a profusion of poetic imagery always appears in their train. Such
> lovely and truly British poetry cannot be too often brought to view;
> we will therefore insert in this part of our work several of these

> Puck and a Fairy.  
> Puck. How now, spirit! whither wander you?  
> *Fai.* Over hill, over dale,  
> Thorough bush, thorough briar,  
> Over park, over pale,  
> Thorough flood, thorough fire.  
> I do wander every where,  
> Swifter than the moonès sphere,  
> And I serve the Fairy-queen,  
> To dew her orbs upon the green.  
> The cowslips tall her pensioners be;  
> In their gold coats spots you see.  
> Those be rubies, fairy favours,  
> In those freckles live their savours.  
> I must go seek some dew-drops here,  
> And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear. \[ad\]  
> Farewell, thou lob of spirits! I'll be gone;  
> Our queen and all her elves come here anon.  
> *Puck.* The king doth keep his revels here to-night  
> Take heed the queen come not within his sight;  
> For Oberon is passing fell and wroth,  
> Because that she, as her attendant, hath  
> A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king,--  
> She never had so sweet a changeling;  
> And jealous Oberon would have the child  
> Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;  
> But she, perforce, withholds the loved boy,  
> Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy;  
> And now they never meet in grove or green,  
> By fountain clear, or spangled star-light sheen,  
> But they do square; that all their elves, for fear,  
> Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there.  
> *Fai.* Either I mistake your shape and making quite,  
> Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite  
> Call'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not he  
> *That frights the maidens of the villagery,  
> Skims milk, and sometimes labours in the quern,  
> And bootless makes the breathless housewife churn;  
> And sometimes makes the drink to bear no barm;  
> Misleads night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?  
> Those that Hob-goblin call you, and sweet Puck.  
> You do their work, and they shall have* good *luck,  
> *Are not you he?  
> *Puck.* Thou speakest aright,  
> I am that merry wanderer of the night.  
> I jest to Oberon, and make him smile,  
> *When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,  
> Neighing in likeness of a filly-foal;  
> *And sometimes lurk I in a gossip's bowl,  
> In very likeness of a roasted crab,  
> And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,  
> And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.  
> The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,  
> Sometimes for three-foot stool mistaketh me:  
> Then slip I from her bum,--down topples she,  
> And *tailor* cries, and falls into a cough;  
> And then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe,  
> And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear  
> A merrier hour was never wasted there.

> The haunts of the Fairies on earth are the most rural and romantic
> that can be selected. They meet

> On hill, in dale, forest or mead,  
> By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,  
> Or on the beached margent of the sea,  
> To dance their ringlets to the whistling wind.

> And the place of Titania's repose is

> In his Shepherd's Pipe, also, Brown thus speaks of the Fairies:--

> Many times he hath been seen  
> With the fairies on the green,  
> And to them his pipe did sound  
> While they danced in a round.  
> Mickle solace they would make him,  
> And at midnight often wake him  
> And convey him from his room  
> To a field of yellow-broom;  
> Or into the meadows where  
> Mints perfume the gentle air,  
> And where Flora spreads her treasure;  
> There they would begin their measure.  
> If it chanced night's sable shrouds  
> Mused Cynthia up in clouds,  
> Safely home they then would see him,  
> And from brakes and quagmires free him.

> But Drayton is the poet after Shakespeare for whom the Fairies had the
> greatest attractions. Even in the Polyobion he does not neglect them.
> In Song xxi., Ringdale, in Cambridgeshire, says,

> For in my very midst there is a swelling ground  
> About which Ceres' nymphs dance many a wanton round;  
> The frisking fairy there, as on the light air borne,  
> Oft run at barley-break upon the ears of corn;  
> And catching drops of dew in their lascivious chases.  
> Do cast the liquid pearl in one another's faces.

> And in Song iv., he had spoken of

> The feasts that underground the faery did him (Arthur) make,  
> And there how he enjoyed the Lady of the Lake.

> Nymphidia is a delicious piece of airy and fanciful invention. The
> description of Oberon's palace in the air, Mab's amours with the
> gentle Pigwiggin, the mad freaks of the jealous Oberon, the pygmy
> Orlando, the mutual artifices of Puck and the Fairy maids of honour,
> Hop, Mop, Pip, Trip, and Co., and the furious combat of Oberon and the
> doughty Pigwiggin, mounted on their earwig chargers--present
> altogether an unequalled fancy-piece, set in the very best and most
> appropriate frame of metre.

> It contains, moreover, several traits of traditionary Fairy lore, such
> as in these lines:

> Hence shadows, seeming idle shapes  
> Of little frisking elves and apes,  
> To earth do make their wanton skapes  
> As hope of pastime hastes them;  
> Which maids think on the hearth they see,  
> When fires well near consumed be,  
> There dancing hays by two and three,  
> Just as their fancy casts them. \[ar\]  
> These make our girls their sluttery rue,  
> By pinching them both black and blue,  
> And put a penny in their shoe,  
> The house for cleanly sweeping;  
> And in their courses make that round,  
> In meadows and in marshes found,  
> Of them so call'd the fairy ground,  
> Of which they have the keeping.  
> These, when a child haps to be got,  
> That after proves an idiot,  
> When folk perceive it thriveth not,  
> The fault therein to smother,  
> Some silly, doating, brainless calf;  
> That understands things by the half;  
> Says that the fairy left this aulf;  
> And took away the other.

> And in these:

> Scarce set on shore but therewithal  
> He meeteth Puck, whom most men call  
> Hobgoblin, and on him doth fail  
> With words from frenzy spoken;  
> "Ho! ho!" quoth Puck, "God save your Grace!  
> Who drest you in this piteous case?  
> He thus that spoiled my sovereign's face,  
> I would his neck were broken.  
> This Puck seems but a dreaming dolt,  
> Still walking like a ragged colt,  
> And oft out of a bush doth bolt,  
> Of purpose to deceive us;  
> And leading us, makes us to stray  
> Long winter nights out of the way;  
> And when we stick in mire and clay,  
> He doth with laughter leave us.

> In the eighth Nymphal,

> A nymph is married to a fay,  
> Great preparations for the day,  
> All rites of nuptials they recite you  
> To the bridal, and invite you.

> The dialogue commences between the nymphs Mertilla and Claia:

> M. But will our Tita wed this fay?  
> *C.* Yes, and to-morrow is the day.  
> *M.* But why should she bestow herself  
> Upon this dwarfish fairy elf?  
> *C.* Why, by her smallness, you may find

> Besides he 's deft and wondrous airy,  
> And of the noblest of the fairy, \[as\]

> Chief of the Crickets, \[at\] of much fame,  
> In Fairy a most ancient name.

> The nymphs now proceed. to describe the bridal array of Tita: her
> jewels are to be dew-drops; her head-dress the "yellows in the
> full-blown rose;" her gown

> Of pansy, pink, and primrose leaves,  
> Most curiously laid on in threaves;

> her train the "cast slough of a snake;" her canopy composed of "moons
> from the peacock's tail," and. "feathers from the pheasant's head;"

> Mix'd with the plume (of so high price),  
> The precious bird of paradise;

> and it shall be

> Borne o'er our head (by our inquiry)  
> By elfs, the fittest of the fairy.

> Her buskins of the "dainty shell" of the lady-cow. The musicians are
> to be the nightingale, lark, thrush, and other songsters of the grove.

> But for still music, we will keep  
> The wren and titmouse, which to sleep  
> Shall sing the bride when she's alone,  
> The rest into their chambers gone;  
> And like those upon ropes that walk  
> On gossamer from stalk to stalk,  
> The tripping fairy tricks shall play  
> The evening of the wedding day.

> Finally, the bride-bed is to be of roses; the curtains, tester, and
> all, of the "flower imperial;" the fringe hung with harebells; the
> pillows of lilies, "with down stuft of the butterfly;"

> For our Tita is to-day,  
> To be married to a fay.

> In Nymphal iii.,

> The fairies are hopping,  
> The small flowers cropping,  
> And with dew dropping,  
> Skip thorow the greaves.  
> At barley-break they play  
> Merrily all the day:  
> At night themselves they lay  
> Upon the soft leaves.

> And in Nymphal vi. the forester says,

> The dryads, hamadryads, the satyrs, and the fawns,  
> Oft play at hide-and-seek before me on the lawns;  
> The frisking fairy oft, when horned Cynthia shines,  
> Before me as I walk dance wanton matachines.

> Milton disdained not to sing

> While tuneful sprites a merry concert made,  
> And airy music warbled through the shade.

> January and May, 459.

> It so befel, in that fair morning tide,
