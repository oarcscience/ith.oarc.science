### III. A Story of Mongán.

Now once upon a time when Forgoll the poet was with Mongán, the latter
at a certain hour of the day went before his \[10\] stronghold, where he
found a bardic scholar <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124) learning
his lesson. <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125) Said Mongán:

'All is lasting  
In a cloak of sackcloth; <span id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_126)  
In due course thou shalt attain  
The end of thy studies.' <span id="fr_127"></span>[4](#fn_127) \[15\]

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mongán then took
pity on the scholar, who was in the cloak of sackcloth. He had little of
any substance. In order to know whether he would be a truthful and good
messenger, <span id="fr_128"></span>[5](#fn_128) he said to hint,
promising him . . .: 'Go now,' said Mongán, 'until

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

thou reach the fairy knoll of Lethet Oidni, <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129) and bring a precious stone which I have
there, and for thyself take a pound of white silver, in which are twelve
ounces. Thou shalt have help from them. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130) This is thy journey <span
id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_131) from here, to Cnocc Bane. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[4](#fn_132) Thou wilt find welcome in the fairy
knoll of Cnocc \[5\] Bane for my sake. Thence to Duma Granerit. <span
id="fr_133"></span>[5](#fn_133) Thence to the fairy knoll of Lethet
Oidni. Take the stone for me, and go to the stream of Lethet Oidni,
where thou wilt find a pound of gold, in which are nine ounces. Take
that with thee for me.'

The man went on his journey. In the fairy knoll of Cnocc \[10\] Bane he
found a noble-looking couple <span id="fr_134"></span>[6](#fn_134) to
meet him. They gave great welcome to a messenger of Mongán's. It was his
due. He went further. He found another couple in Durna Granerit, where
he had the same welcome. He went to the fairy knoll of Lethet Oidni,
where again he found another couple. \[15\] They gave great welcome to a
man of Mongán's. He was most hospitably entertained, as on the other
nights. There was a marvellous chamber <span
id="fr_135"></span>[7](#fn_135) at the side of the couple's house.
Mongán had told him that he should ask for its key. He did so. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[8](#fn_136) The key was brought to him. He opens it.
He had been told \[20\] not to take anything out of the house except
what he had been sent for. He does so. The key he gave back to the
couple;

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

his stone, however, and his pound of silver he took with him. Thereupon
he went to the stream of Lethet Oidni, out of which he took his pound of
gold. He went back to Mongán, to whom he gave his stone and his gold. He
himself takes his silver. \[5\] These were his wanderings.

Forgoll's pupils.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[54:2](vob06.htm#fr_125) *Aiciucht*, from Lat.
*acceptum*. Perhaps this refers to the tract called *Uraicept ma
n-écsine*, which formed part of the first year's studies of the aspiring
poet. See Thurneysen, *Mittelir. Versl.*, p. 115.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[54:3](vob06.htm#fr_126) *i.e.* to a beginner
it seems as if he would never reach the end of his studies. The cloak of
sackcloth was probably the professional garb of the bardic student.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[54:4](vob06.htm#fr_127) Lit. 'thon wilt reach
according to proper order the sections (*dréchtu*) concerning
*druimmne*.' The course of study was divided into *dréicht* or portions
(see Thurneysen, l.c., p. 115). According to one authority this course
extended over 12 years, and in the last year certain metres were taught,
which were called *druimmne súithe*, 'height (lit. ridge) of wisdom.'
(See Thurneysen, l.c., p. 119.)

<span id="fn_128"></span>[54:5](vob06.htm#fr_128) *lit*. whether his
journey would be truthful and good.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[55:3](vob06.htm#fr_131) lit. these are thy
journeys, the stages of thy journey.

as I know; but see Trip. Life; p. 311.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[55:6](vob06.htm#fr_134) *sainredach* lit.
special, seems sometimes, like *sain* itself, to have the meaning of
'specially fine, distinguished, excellent,' as in *inna cáine
sainredchæ* 'of singular beauty,' Ml. 37 b, to. Or does it here mean 'a
special couple,' *i.e.* separate, by themselves?

<span id="fn_135"></span>[55:7](vob06.htm#fr_135) *airecol* n., borrowed
from Lat. *oraculum*, has come to mean any detached house of one
chamber; here it is a treasure-house.
