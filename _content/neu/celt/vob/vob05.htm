A Story from which it is inferred that Mong&aacute;n was Find mac Cumaill, and the cause of the death of Fothad Airgdech.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></h3>  
<p>Mong&aacute;n was in Rathmore of Moylinny in his kingship. To him went Forgoll the poet. Through him many a married [5] couple was complaining to Mong&aacute;n.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Every night the poet would recite a story to Mong&aacute;n. So great was his lore that they were thus from Halloween to May-day. He had gifts and food from Mong&aacute;n.</p>  
<p>One day Mong&aacute;n asked his poet what was the death of [10] Fothad Airgdech. Forgoll said he was slain at Duffry in Leinster.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>' Mong&aacute;n said it was false. The poet said he would satirise him with his lampoons, and he would satirise his father and his mother and his grandfather, and he would sing (spells) upon their waters, so that fish should not be caught in their [15] river-mouths. He would sing upon their woods, so that they should not give fruit, upon their plains, so that they should be barren for ever of any produce. Mong&aacute;n promised him his will of precious things as far as (the value of) seven handmaids, or twice seven handmaids, or three times seven. At last he offers [20] him one-third, or one-half of his land, or his whole land; at last (anything) save only his own liberty with (that of) his wife Bre&oacute;thigernd, unless he were redeemed before the end of three days. The poet refused all except as regards the woman. For the sake of his honour Mong&aacute;n consented. Thereat the [25]</p>

<p>woman was sorrowful. The tear was not taken from her cheek. Mong&aacute;n told her not to be sorrowful, help would certainly come to them.</p>  
<p>So it came to the third day. The poet began to enforce his [5] bond. Mong&aacute;n told him to wait till evening. He and his wife were in their bower. The woman weeps as her surrender drew near and she saw no help. Mong&aacute;n said: 'Be not sorrowful, woman. He who is even now coming to our help, I hear his feet in the Labrinne.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>[10] They wait a while. Again the woman wept. 'Weep not, woman ' He who is now coming to our help, I hear his feet in the M&aacute;in.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Thus they were waiting between every two watches of the day. She would weep, he would still say: 'Weep not, woman, [15] He who is now coming to our help, I hear his feet in the Laune, in Lough Leane,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the Morning-star River between the &Uacute;i Fidgente and the Arada,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in the Suir on Moy-Fevin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> in</p>

<p>When night came to them, Mong&aacute;n was, on his couch in his palace, and his wife at his right hand, and she sorrowful. The [5] poet was summoning them by their sureties and their bonds. While they were there, a man is announced approaching the rath from the south. His cloak was in a fold around him, and in his hand a headless spear-shaft that was not very small. By that shaft he leapt across the three ramparts, so that he was in [10] the middle of the garth, thence into the middle of the palace, thence between Mong&aacute;n and the wall at his pillow. The poet was in the back of the house behind the king. The question is argued in the house before the warrior that had come. 'What is the matter here?' said be. 'I and the poet yonder,' said [15] Mong&aacute;n, 'have made a wager about the death of Fothad Airgdech. He said it was at Duffry in Leinster. I said that was false.' The warrior said the poet was wrong. 'It will be . . .,' said Forgoll, '. . .'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> 'That were not good,' said the warrior. 'It shall be proved. 'We were with thee, with Find,' said the [20] warrior. 'Hush!' said Mong&aacute;n, 'that is not fair.' 'We were with Find, then,' said he. 'We came from Scotland. We met with Fothad Airgthech here yonder on the Larne river. There we fought a battle. I made a cast at him, so that it passed</p>

<p>through him and went into the earth beyond him and left its iron head in the earth. This here is the shaft that was in that spear. The bare stone from which I made that cast will be found, and the iron head will be found in the earth, and the [5] tomb of Fothad Airgdech will be found a little to the east of it. A stone chest is about him there in the earth. There, upon the chest, are his two bracelets of silver, and his two arm-rings, and his neck-torque of silver. And by his tomb there is a stone pillar. And on the end of the pillar that is in the earth [10] there is Ogam. This is what it says: "This is Eochaid Airgdech. C&aacute;ilte slew me in an encounter against Find."'</p>  
<p>They went with the warrior. Everything was found thus. It was C&aacute;ilte, Find's foster-son, that had come to them. Mong&aacute;n, however, was Find, though he would not let it be told.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_113"></A><A HREF="vob05.htm#fr_113">50:1</A> According to Hennessy (Jubainville, Le Cycle Mythologrque, p. 339) the river Caragh, which flows into Dingle Bay, co. Kerry. O&#8217;Donovan, who gives a wrong nominative, Labhrann instead of Labrainne (F.M., A.M., 3751), supposed it to be the Cashen in the north of co. Kerry; but that would not suit. Cf. tomaidm Fleisce 7 Mane 7 Labrainne, LL. 17 b, 45.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_114"></A><A HREF="vob05.htm#fr_114">50:2</A> This must be the name of some small stream between the Caragh and the Laune. It cannot be the Maine, the Irish name of which is Maing, gen.
