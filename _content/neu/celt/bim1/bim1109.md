### GOD IN THE SUN.

Question. Why is the face turned towards the sun in every asseveration
and Prayer?

Answer. Because God is in every light, and the chief of every light is
the sun. <span id="fr_271"></span>[4](#fn_269) It is through fire that
God brings

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span> <span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

back to Himself all things that have emanated from Him; therefore it is
not right to ally one's self to God, but in the light. There are three
kinds of light, namely: that of the sun, and hence fire; that which is
obtained in the sciences of teachers; and that which is possessed in the
understanding of the head and heart, that is, in the soul. On that
account, every vow is made in the face of the three lights, that is, in
the light of the sun is seen the light of a teacher, or demonstration;
and from both of these is the light of the intellect, or that of the
soul.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[263:4](bim1109.htm#fr_271) <span
id="page_262">p. 262</span> Howel ap Davydd ap Ieuan ap Rhys, (A.D.
1450--1480,) clearly alludes to the doctrine of the text in the
following couplet;--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Y (Drindod, Duwdod) yn rhod y r haul  
Ai annedd yn y wennaul.

The (Trinity, Deity) in the course of the sun,  
Having His habitation in the bright sun.  
                           I Fair a Sioseb.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> On which Ieuan Tir
Iarll, who presided in the Chair of Glamorgan A.D. 1760, and was
remarkably well versed in Bardic lore, has the following observations;--

"There was a general opinion in the age when this was composed, that the
sun was the abode, or habitation of God--in other words, that the sun
was heaven. There are many words and sentences in other poems and odes
which show <span id="page_264">p. 264</span> that such was the view held
by our ancestors respecting the sun. One of the Names of God in
primitive times was Hu, and therefore the sun was designated *Huan*,
which means *annedd Hu*, or the abode of God. Sion Mowddwy, in a poem in
which he sends the sun as a messenger, says,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Yr haul glan hir olau glwys,  
A’i rhediad o Baradwys,  
Gan ENW DUW y gwnai’n dawel  
Golianu o beutu ’r bel;  
Golan nef wyd gwiwlawn faeth,  
Golau ’r byd glaer wybodaeth.

Fair sun, with enduring and beautiful light,  
Having thy course from Paradise,  
By the NAME OF GOD dost thou quietly  
Illumine all around the globe;  
Thou art the light of heaven, worthy fosterer,  
Light of the world, clear knowledge.  
                               Sion Mowddwy.

</div>

"It may be supposed that they formerly sacrificed to the sun, or at
least in the face of the sun, which, in the opinion of those who are
skilled in the Mysteries of the Bards, is the most probable, for I have
not yet noticed in any place which <span id="page_265">p. 265</span> I
have read, that they themselves worshipped the sun, but only Him who
dwelt in it. Therefore, in the act of worshipping, as well as in the
performance of every other solemn rite, they did all in the face of the
sun and the eye of light, that is, in the face, or before the face of
Him, whom they regarded as living and existing in the sun and the light.

"Gwilym Tew, in a poem eulogistic of the large wine flagon of Rhys ap
Sion of Glyn Nedd, says thus;--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Grenn our llaw gywrain Eurych,  
A mîn gronn yn trammwy ’n grych,  
*Aberth* *yr haul*, a byrth Rys  
*Yn ei hwyneb* yw ’n hynys.

Golden vessel, the ingenious workmanship of a goldsmith,  
With a rounded rim, running along in curls;  
*The sacrifice of the sun*, supported by Rhys,  
*In its face*, is our island."
