<p>In some Books the Bards' enigma is as follows:--</p>  
<p>There is no God but what cannot be comprehended;<br> There is nothing that cannot be comprehended but what is not conceivable;<br> There is nothing not conceivable but what is immeasurable;<br> There is nothing immeasurable but God;<br> There is no God but what is not conceivable.</p>  
<p>Here is the ancient Bards' enigma:--</p>  
<p>There is no God but what is not conceivable;<br> There is nothing not conceivable but God;<br> There is no God but what is immeasurable;<br> There is nothing immeasurable but God.</p>

<p>Here is another form of it.</p>  
<p>There is nothing immeasurable but what is not conceivable;<br> There is nothing immeasurable but God;<br> There is nothing immeasurable but the greatest of all;<br> There can be no two of the greatest of all in any thing.</p>  
<p>Here is a solution of the enigma.</p>  
<p>What is not conceivable is the greatest of all, and the immeasurable of what is not in place;<br> God is the greatest of all, and the immeasurable of intelligence;<br> And there can be no existence to any thing but from intelligence;<br> And the non-existence of all things comes from what is not in place.</p>  
<p>As the Bard says:</p>  
<p>What is not conceivable is the greatest, and the immeasurable of all that is not in place;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> God is the greatest, and the immeasurable of all that are together in place.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_219"></A><A HREF="bim1091.htm#fr_220">215:2</A> "Dirgel" is compounded of "dir," true, and "cel," concealment.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_220"></A><A HREF="bim1091.htm#fr_221">215:3</A> It is very difficult to render the exact meaning of "dim" in this place, which is evidently not <i>nothing</i> in the popular use of the term. The translation, which we have adopted, was suggested by the late Archdeacon Williams in his <i>Gomer</i>, p. 136, and is in fact the "nihil cogitabile," as distinguished from the "nihil purum," in Sir William Hamilton's analysis of negative thought.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_222"></A><A HREF="bim1091.htm#fr_223">217:2</A> "Cymmant," from "cyd," with, or together, and "man," a place. Al. "that is restored in place"--"that is in place all around "--"intellectual place"--"elementation."</P>
