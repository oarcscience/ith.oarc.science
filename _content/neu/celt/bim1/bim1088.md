### CYTHRAUL. <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_217)

There are three benefits to be had from Cythraul: the defection of evil;
a view to goodness; and the triumph of victory over what is contrary to
the beneficial.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_217"></span>[213:2](bim1088.htm#fr_218) <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> Bardism recognises another principle of
evil, which is called "DERA," respecting which Iolo Morganwg has the
following note:--"The old Bardic idea was that the DERA usurped the
occupation of Cylch y Ceugant, and that he would suffer none but himself
to occupy it, destroying all other beings;--that God, being more
powerful, is able to dispossess him, and, with Himself to occupy it,
creates beings highly susceptible of happiness, to enjoy it with Him to
all <span id="page_213">p. 213</span> eternity, on condition of joining
with Him to resist evil. The common proverb is hence derived--'Myn y
diawl y cwbl iddo ei hunan, fal y cybydd: mae Duw, fal yr haul, yn rhoi
than i bob un arall.'"
