### BARDISM.

THE ELEMENTS.

There are five elements, and from them, and their conjunction, are all
things, living and dead, that is to say: calas; fluidity; breath; uvel;
and nwyvre. From calas is every corporeity, namely, the earth, and every
thing hard; from fluidity are moisture and flux; from breath are every
wind, breeze, respiration, and air; from uvel are all heat, fire, and
light; and from nwyvre every life and motion, every spirit, every soul
of man, and, from its union with the other elements, other living
beings. From nwyvre, in its simplicity, apart from every thing else, is
God, for God is nwyvre, and is incapable of variety, or change, or
death, or corruption, or diminution, for there can be no place where He
is not, or time in which He does not exist.

Different names are given to the elements in other Books, that is,
earth, water, air, fire, and nyv; and in other Books, thus, namely, &c.
From the union of calas with water is a body; from the union of water
with firmament, <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_346) darkness; from the
union of firmament, or air, with fire, heat; from the union of fire with
nyv, moving energy, and every motion from place to place; and from nyv
are all life and its characteristics, namely, understanding, memory,
awen, affection, hatred, sorrow, joy, &c.
