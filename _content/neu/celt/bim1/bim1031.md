### THE PRIMARY LETTERS.--THEIR AUGMENTATION.--RESTORATION OF THE COELBREN.

This is what I, Llywelyn Sion, <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_92) took
from the Book of Davydd Benwyn, <span id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_93)
which is called the Coelbren of the Bards.

Here is the system of the symbols of letters, or the symbols of language
and speech, as it was arranged by Gwilym Tew, <span
id="fr_95"></span>[4](#fn_94) Bard and Chair Teacher, and exhibited at
the Eisteddvod of the Chair and Gorsedd of Pen Rhys Monastery, <span
id="fr_96"></span>[5](#fn_95) when Owain Glyndwr and the Cymry were
prevailing against the Saxons. <span id="fr_97"></span>[6](#fn_96)

There were ten symbols of letters in the possession of the Cymry from
the beginning, before they came into the Isle of Britain, which ten are
now kept an undivulged secret by the Bards of the Isle of Britain, and
therefore no man can radically understand the Coelbren of letters, who
is not under the obligation of the vow of the secret of the Bards of the
Isle of Britain. In the time of Dyvnwal Moelmud, son of Dyvnvarth, son
of Prydain, son of Aedd the Great, the symbolic cuttings of language and
speech were augmented

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

to sixteen in number, and they were mutually divulged, and to each was
given a new form, other than what the ten symbolic points that are
secret and undivulged have. In the time when Bell the Great, son of
Manog, <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_97) was king paramount of the
Isle of Britain, the sixteen symbols were laid open to the nation of the
Cymry, and security was given that there should be no king, judge, or
teacher of country, without knowing the sixteen signs, and being able to
reduce them into proper art. It was ages after that, before
understanding respecting the symbols of Plagawd, that is, dressed skins,
was obtained, and when that took place, the Roll was invented, and after
that, the Books that are now seen in use. The number of the symbols was
augmented until they were found to be eighteen in the time of Taliesin,
chief of Bards, who employed them in his canons, hence the improvement
of vocal song. After that the number of the symbols was raised to
twenty, that is, the primaries, as at present. After that Geraint, the
Blue Bard, began to use auxiliary symbols, which he invented, and which
others, after him, improved, and the Bards kept memorials of them. When
Owain Glyndwr was lost, plagawd and paper were prohibited in Cymru; and
the Bards and Teachers, and all others who were required to keep
memorials, were obliged to restore into sight and use the symbols of the
Coelbren of the Bards, until the making them ready for the cutting
became an art. Then they became infinitely numerous by the hands of
sieve and basket makers, who sold them to any one that sought for them,
and so they continued down to the days of those who are now living. It
is Davydd Benwyn that says it.

assiduity.
