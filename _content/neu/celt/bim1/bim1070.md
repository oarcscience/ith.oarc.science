### COELBREN OF SIMPLE LETTERS.

Occasionally the Bards kept Coelbrens of simple letters, that is to say,
one letter on each piece of wood; and by putting them together,
according to the requirement of word and name, they mutually
communicated one with the other, and understood and acquainted
themselves with each other, without speech, and in secrecy. Every one of
the pieces of wood was four sided, having six surfaces to each, and a
letter on each surface, differently coloured, so that what was wanted
might be obtained at sight without much searching. The arrangement of
twenty-four was found to be the best for those Coelbrens; and from
obtaining mutual knowledge by means of the said Coelbrens secrets were
ascertained, which caused much astonishment as to how it was possible.
