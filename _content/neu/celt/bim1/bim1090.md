### THE THREE IMPERCEPTIBILITIES OF GOD.

There are three things that are imperceptible in God: His origin,
because there can have been no time in which He did not exist; the
greatness of His love, for how much so ever He does, He will see no end
to what He can in justice accomplish; and His power, because there is no
end, size, or measure to what He can do after the utmost intention.
