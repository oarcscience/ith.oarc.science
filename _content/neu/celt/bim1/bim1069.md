### BURNING THE LETTERS.

It was in the time of Llyr of Defective Speech that the way of burning
the cyrvens with an iron stamp was understood, that is, there was an
iron for every letter, heated red hot, with which they burnt on an ebill
or a board what was required; and sometimes they formed letters on wood
with the small prickings of a hot fork.
