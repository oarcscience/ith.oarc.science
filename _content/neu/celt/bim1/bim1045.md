Some have substituted

 

<span id="img_08701"></span> ![](img/08701.jpg)

But the best of all is the old Coelbren, as Gwilym Tew <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_119) has arranged it in his Book of Vocal
Song, and the easiest to cut, and of least labour.

Some have placed <span id="img_08702"></span> ![](img/08702.jpg) without
<span id="img_08703"></span> ![](img/08703.jpg), but that is an error,
for <span id="img_08704"></span> ![](img/08704.jpg) has the weight of
<span id="img_08705"></span> ![](img/08705.jpg), and no more; therefore
it ought to be <span id="img_08706"></span> ![](img/08706.jpg), and not
<span id="img_08707"></span> ![](img/08707.jpg).

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Here are other modifications of the Coelbren, which I have seen with
Meurig Davydd. <span id="fr_121"></span>[\*](#fn_120) <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_118"></span>[85:1](bim1045.htm#fr_119) <span
id="page_84">p. 84</span> Llawdden, or Ieuan Llawdden, was a very
eminent Poet, who flourished from about 1440 to 1480. He was at one time
Rector of Machynlleth, but in his old age he retired to the place of his
nativity, the Vale of Llychwr, where he died, and was buried in the
Churchyard of Llandeilo Talybont. His elegy <span id="page_85">p.
85</span> was written by his contemporary, Iorwerth Vynglwyd, from which
we learn that he obtained the highest bardic honours.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[87:1](bim1045.htm#fr_120) <span
id="page_86">p. 86</span> Gwilym Tew was a Poet who flourished from 1430
to 1470, and who presided at the Glamorgan Gorsedd in 1460.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[89:\*](bim1045.htm#fr_121) <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> Taliesin Williams says that this observation
is Llywelyn Sion's.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[89:1](bim1045.htm#fr_122) An eminent Poet of
Glamorgan, who presided in the Gorsedd Morganwg in the year 1560, and
died in 1600. Llywelyn Sion in the early part of his life was well
acquainted with him.
