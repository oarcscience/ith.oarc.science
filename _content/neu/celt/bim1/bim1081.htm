<p>The Triads of Bardism, that is, the Triads of godly sciences, and of wisdom through Awen from God, which was given through the Holy Spirit to the primitive Bards of the Isle of Britain from the age of ages, according to the system and instruction of the three primary Bards and teachers of the Isle of Britain and the nation of the Cymry.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And this instruction is adjudged as authorized by the memorials and voice of the Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, in right of the nation of the Cymry, and according to the privilege and usage of the Bards of the Isle of Britain.</p>  
<p>1. There are three immeasurable unities: place; time; and life;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that is, neither one nor other of them has either a beginning or an end.</p>  
<p>2. There are three primary unities, and more than one of each cannot exist: one God; one truth; and one point of liberty, and that is, where all things, and all opposites, equiponderate.</p>  
<p>3. Three things spring from the three primary unities: all life; all goodness; and all power.</p>

<p>4. The three attributes of God, being of primary co-existence: the greatest of all things in respect of life; and the greatest of all things in respect of might and power. Others say thus:</p>  
<p>5. God is of three necessities, that is: the greatest in respect of life; the greatest in respect of knowledge; and the greatest in respect of might and power; and there can only be one greatest of any thing.</p>  
<p>6. Three things which God cannot but be: what perfect goodness ought to be; what perfect goodness would desire-to be; and what perfect goodness can be.</p>  
<p>7. The three primaries of all things: materiality; motion; and vitality.</p>  
<p>8. The three characteristics of existence: time; place; and action.</p>  
<p>9. The three stabilities of existence: nature; individuality; and continuance.</p>  
<p>10. The three discriminations of existence: size; form; and operation.</p>
