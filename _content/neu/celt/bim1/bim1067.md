### COELBREN OF THE BARDS.

Here is shewn the mode of making the Coelbren of the Bards. Small pieces
of wood are taken, split, about a cubit in length, and squared, until
they are four sided, the width of each side being less than half an
inch, that is, its width will be about the length of a barley corn. On
these sides the letters are cut; but before they are cut, it is
requisite that the edges should be rasped, in order that, when the
letters are cut on one side, their heads may not appear as characters on
the other sides, except in the rasping.
