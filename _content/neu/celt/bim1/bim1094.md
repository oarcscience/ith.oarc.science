### THE DIVINE NAMES.

Some have called God the Father HEN DDIHENYDD, <span
id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_224) because it is from His nature that all
things are derived, and from Him is the beginning of every thing, and in
Him is no beginning, for He can not but exist, and nothing can have a
beginning without a beginner. And God the Son is called IAU, <span
id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_225) that is, God under a finite form and
corporeity,

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span> <span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

for a finite being cannot otherwise know and perceive God. And when He
became man in this world, He was called JESUS CHRIST, for He was not
from everlasting under a finite form and body. And the man who believes
in Him, and performs the seven works of mercy, shall be delivered from
the pain of Abred, and blessed for ever be he who does so. Jesus Christ
is also called GOD THE DOVYDD; <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_226) and
He has also other names, such as PERYDD, <span
id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_227) and GOD THE NER, <span
id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_228) and GOD THE NAV. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[4](#fn_229)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_224"></span>[219:1](bim1094.htm#fr_225) <span
id="page_218">p. 218</span> That is, " the Ancient and Unoriginated
One." The word occurs as one of the designations of the Supreme Being in
the Welsh Bible, Dan. vii. 7; in the English Bible it is "the Ancient of
days." The following definition of the word is given in one of Iolo
Morganwg's Notes;--"Dihenydd--Gwehynwg. Yr Hen Wehynwg, the same as Hen
Ddihenydd. (Barddas.) Gwehynwg, sef y tardd i fywydoldeb yn Annwn--the
original lifespring, or springing into life at the lowest point of
animated existence, or out of the chaotic mass of matter in its utmost
state of decomposition."

<span id="fn_225"></span>[219:2](bim1094.htm#fr_226) <span
id="page_219">p. 219</span> The word is here taken in the sense of
*Younger*, or as denoting the last manifestation of the Deity.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[221:1](bim1094.htm#fr_227) "Dovydd;" Domitor;
the Tamer.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[221:2](bim1094.htm#fr_228) "Perydd;" the
Causer; the First Cause; the Creator.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[221:3](bim1094.htm#fr_229) "Ner;" Energy; the
Powerful.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[221:4](bim1094.htm#fr_230) "Nav;" the Former;
the Creator. Sion Cent has a Poem on "the Names of God," into which he
has introduced all these, with the exception of "Hen Ddihenydd," and
"Perydd," thus,--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Duw, *Dofydd* mawr, Ionawr, *Iau*.  
Ener, Muner, Ner, *Naf* ydyw.  
                See Iolo MSS. p. 235.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They are also,
with many others of undoubtedly Druidic origin, still used by the Cymry
as epithets for the Deity.
