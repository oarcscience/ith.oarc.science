# BAPTISM AFTER DEATH.

The saint was not insensible to the charms of poetry, nor to the merits
of the pieces in which the heathen bards of Ireland celebrated the fame
of their dead heroes. He lamented the fate of so many noble-minded and
heroic men, who had gone from the earth before the light of Christianity
was vouchsafed. Passing one day by the tomb of one of these heroes
lately deceased, he stopped, seemingly disturbed and grieved, and
entered into prayer. Tears fell fast from him as he was on his knees,
and when he rose he ordered the tombstone to be removed. Looking on the
serene noble features, he prayed earnestly that life might return for a
short time to its former tenement. The supplication was heard; the now
living man half raised himself in his tomb, was instructed by the
great-hearted saint, and baptized. Then laying himself down with
heavenly joy stamped on his features, he again surrendered his soul to
its Maker.
