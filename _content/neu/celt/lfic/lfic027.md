# The Black Cattle of Durzy Island

Several centuries since, a family residing on Durzy Island, off Bantry
Bay, found a beautiful little coal-black bull and cow on a verdant spot
near the beach. The cow furnished sufficient butter and milk for all
domestic wants, and next year a calf was added to the number. When this
youngster was come to the age of affording additional support to the
family, a wicked servant girl, one day milking the parent cow, so far
forgot herself as to strike the gentle beast with the spancel, and curse
her bitterly. The outraged animal turned round to the other two, who
were grazing at some distance, and lowed to them in a sorrowful tone,
and immediately the three moved rapidly off to the sea. They plunged in,
and forthwith the three rocks, since known as the Bull, Cow, and Calf,
arose, and continue to this day to protest against the wickedness and
ingratitude of cross-grained servant girls.

We are indebted to Captain F. W. L. Thomas, R.N., for the following
legend of the sea-dwellers:--
