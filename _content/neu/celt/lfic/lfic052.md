# THE APPARITION IN OLD ROSS.

An instance came under our own notice of the almost establishing of a
ghost story that would have braved investigation and contradiction. A
gentleman farmer, Mr. J----of Old Ross, was returning home in company
with his daughter, about eleven o'clock at night, from a visit paid in
their neighbourhood. They were going up a steep hill, with a stiff
breeze at their backs, and as they advanced they saw on the top of the
ascent a headless man, perfectly motionless. The poor young woman was
terribly frightened, and held convulsively by her father's arm. He was
also terrified not a little, but his habitual piety came to his aid.
"Don't fear, child," said he; "we are in God's presence, and under His
protection. This thing, if it be evil, cannot harm us without His
permission." So, though his heart beat violently, he advanced,
supporting his daughter; and when they were at the proper distance,
their apparition changed into a poor ass, who had selected that spot to
face the wind, with legs firmly planted and head lowered. The poor young
lady nearly fainted, but they managed to get home without further
adventure. Had they turned on one side at the first glimpse of the
dreadful sight, the hill would have been a haunted one to this day.
