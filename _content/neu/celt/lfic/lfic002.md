Dedication

 

TO

 

JOSEPH SHERIDAN LE FANU, ESQ.

AUTHOR OF "UNCLE SILAS," ETC.

DEAR SIR,

I beg to offer this collection of Irish Legends to your acceptance, from
respect for your high position among English writers, in consideration
of your being a truly good man, and in gratitude for your kind
encouragement of my own literary attempts. Without that encouragement I
should probably never have an opportunity of penning a dedication to any
one.

I am, dear Sir,

Your faithful Servant

PATRICK KENNEDY.

LOUGH NA PIASTHA COTTAGE.
