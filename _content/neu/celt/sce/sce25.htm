<P>15. AMONG other In&#131;tances of undoubted Verity, proving in the&#131;e the Being of &#131;uch aerial People, or Species of Creatures not vulgarly known, I add the &#131;ub&#131;equent Relations, &#131;ome whereof I have from my Acquaintance with the Actors and Patients, and the Re&#131;t from the Eye-witne&#131;&#131;es to the Matter of Fact. The fir&#131;t whereof &#131;hall be of the Woman taken out of her Child-bed, and having a lingring Image of her &#131;ub&#131;tituted Bodie in her Roome, which Re&#131;emblance decay'd, dy'd, and was bur'd. But the Per&#131;on &#131;tollen returning to her Hu&#131;band after two Years Space, he being convinced by many undenyable Tokens that &#131;he</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">was</P>
<P><A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A></P>
<P>was his former Wyfe, admitted her Home, and had diver&#131;e Children by her. Among other Reports &#131;he gave her Hu&#131;band, this was one: That &#131;he perceived litle what they did in the &#131;pacious Hou&#131;e &#131;he lodg'd in, untill &#131;he anointed one of her Eyes with a certain Unction that was by her; which they perceaving to have acqainted her with their Actions, they fain'd her blind of that Eye with a Puff of their Breath. She found the Place full of Light, without any Fountain or Lamp from whence it did &#131;pring. This Per&#131;on lived in the Countrey nixt to that of my la&#131;t Re&#131;idence, and might furni&#131;h Matter of Di&#131;pute among&#131;t Ca&#131;ui&#131;ts, whither if her Hu&#131;band had been mary'd in the Interim of her two Years Ab&#131;ence, he was oblidged to divor&#131;e from the &#131;econd Spou&#131;e at the Return of the fir&#131;t. There is ane Airt, appearingly without Super&#131;tition, for recovering of &#131;uch as are &#131;tolen, but think it &#131;uperfluous to in&#131;ert it.</P>
<P>I SAW a Woman of fourtie Years of Age, and examined her (having another Clergie Man in my Companie) about a Report that pa&#131;t of</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">her</P>
<P><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></P>
<P>her long fa&#131;ting, [<I>her Name is not intyre</I>.]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It was told by them of the Hou&#131;e, as well as her &#131;elfe, that &#131;he tooke verie little or no Food for &#131;everall Years pa&#131;t; that &#131;he tarried in the Fields over Night, &#131;aw and conver&#131;ed with a People &#131;he knew not, having wandered in &#131;eeking of her Sheep, and &#131;leep't upon a Hillock, and finding her &#131;elf tran&#131;ported to another Place before Day. The Woman had a Child &#131;ince that Time, and is &#131;till prettie melanchollyous and &#131;ilent, hardly ever &#131;een to laugh. Her natural Heat and radical Moi&#131;ture &#131;eem to be equally balanced, lyke ane unextingui&#131;hed Lamp, and going in a Circle, not unlike to the faint Lyfe of Bees, and &#131;ome Sort of Birds, that &#131;leep all the Winter over, and revive in the Spring.</P>
<P>IT is u&#131;uall in all magicall Airts to have the Candidates prepo&#131;&#131;e&#131;&#131;it with a Believe of their Tutor's Skill, and Ability to perform their Feats, and act their jugling Pranks and Legerdemain; but a Per&#131;on called Stewart, po&#131;&#131;e&#131;&#131;ed with a prejudice at that was &#131;poken of the 2d Sight,</P>

<P>and living near to my Hou&#131;e, was &#131;oe put to it by a Seer, before many Witne&#131;&#131;es, that he lo&#131;t his Speech and Power of his Legs, and breathing exce&#131;&#131;ively, as if expyring, becau&#131;e of the many fearfull Wights that appeared to him. The Companie were forced to carrie him into the Hou&#131;e.</P>
<P>IT is notoriou&#131;ly known what in Killin, within Perth&#131;hire, fell tragically out with a Yeoman that liv'd hard by, who coming into a Companie within ane Ale-hou&#131;e, where a Seer &#131;at at Table, that at the Sight of the Intrant Neighbour, the Seer &#131;tarting, ro&#131;e to go out of the Hous; and being a&#131;ked the Rea&#131;on of his ha&#131;t, told that the intrant Man &#131;hould die within two Days; at which News the named Intrant &#131;labb'd the Seer, and was him&#131;elf executed two Days after for the Fact.</P>
<P>A MINISTER, verie intelligent, but mi&#131;believing all &#131;uch Sights as were not ordinar, chanceing to be in a narrow Lane with a Seer, who perceaving a Wight of a known Vi&#131;age furio&#131;lie to encounter them, the Seer de&#131;ired the Mini&#131;ter to turn out of the Way; who &#131;corning his</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Rea&#131;on</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Rea&#131;on, and holding him &#131;elfe in the Path with them, when the Seer was going ha&#131;tily out of the Way, they were both violently ca&#131;t a &#131;ide to a good Di&#131;tance, and the Fall made them lame for all their Lyfe. A little after the Mini&#131;ter was carried Home, one came to tol the Bell for the Death of the Man who&#131;e Repre&#131;entation met them in the narrow Path &#131;ome Halfe ane Hour before.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Example is: A Seer in Kintyre, in Scotland, &#131;itting at Table with diver&#131;e others, &#131;uddenly did ca&#131;t his Head a&#131;ide. The Companie a&#131;king him why he did it, he an&#131;wered, that &#131;uch a Friend of his, by Name, then in Ireland, threatened immediately to ca&#131;t a Di&#131;hfull of Butter in his Face. The Men wrote down the Day and Hour, and &#131;ent to the Gentleman to know the Truth; which Deed the Gentleman declared he did at that verie Time, for he knew that his Friend was a Seer, and would make &#131;port with it. The Men that were pre&#131;ent, and examined the Matter exactly, told me this Story; and with all, that a Seer would with all his Opticks perceive no other Object &#131;o readily as this, at &#131;uch a Di&#131;tance.</P>
