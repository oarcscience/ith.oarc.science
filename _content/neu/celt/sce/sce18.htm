THEIR Weapons are mo&#131;t what &#131;olid earthly Bodies, nothing of Iron, but much of Stone, like to yellow &#131;oft Flint Spa, &#131;haped like a barbed Arrow-head, but flung like a Dairt, with great Force. The&#131;e Armes (cut by Airt and Tools it &#131;eems beyond humane) have &#131;omething of the Nature of Thunderbolt &#131;ubtilty, and mortally wounding the vital Parts without breaking the Skin; of which Wounds I have ob&#131;erved in</P>

<P>THE MEN of that SECOND SIGHT do not di&#131;cover &#131;trange Things when a&#131;ked, but at Fits and Raptures, as if in&#131;pyred with &#131;ome Genius at that In&#131;tant, which before did lurk in or about them. Thus I have frequently &#131;poke to one of them, who in his Tran&#131;port told he cut the Bodie of one of tho&#131;e People in two with his Iron Weapon, and &#131;o e&#131;caped this On&#131;et, yet he &#131;aw nothing left behind of that appearing divyded; at other Times he out wre&#131;ted [wre&#131;tled?] &#131;ome of them. His Neibours often perceaved this Man to di&#131;appear at a certane Place, and about one Hour after to become vi&#131;ible, and di&#131;cover him &#131;elfe near a Bow-&#131;hot from the fir&#131;t Place. It was in that Place where he became invi&#131;ible, &#131;aid he, that the Subterraneans did encounter and combate with him. Tho&#131;e who are un&#131;eened or un&#131;anctified (called Fey) are &#131;aid to be pierced or wounded with tho&#131;e People's Weapons, which makes them do</P>

<P>&#131;omewhat verie unlike their former Practice, cau&#131;ing a sudden Alteration, yet the Cau&#131;e thereof unperceavable at pre&#131;ent; nor have they Power (either they cannot make u&#131;e of their natural Powers, or a&#131;k't not the heavenly Aid,) to e&#131;cape the Blow impendent. A Man of the Second Sight perceaved a Per&#131;on standing by him (found to others view) wholly gored in Blood, and he (amazed-like) bid him in&#131;tantly flee. The whole Man laught at his Airt and Warning, &#131;ince there was no appearance of Danger. He had &#131;carce contracted his Lips from Laughter, when unexpectedly his Enemy leapt in at his Side, and &#131;tab'd him with their Weapons. They al&#131;o pierce Cows or other Animals, u&#131;ewally &#131;aid to be Elf-&#131;hot, who&#131;e pure&#131;t Sub&#131;tance (if they die) the&#131;e Subterraneans take to live on, viz. the aereal and &aelig;therial Parts, the mo&#131;t &#131;pirituous Matter for prolonging of Life, &#131;uch as Aquavit&aelig; (moderately taken) is among Liquors, leaving the terre&#131;trial behind. The Cure of &#131;uch Hurts is, only for a Man to find out the Hole with his Finger; as if the Spirits flowing from a Man's</P>
