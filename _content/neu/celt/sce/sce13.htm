So are they &#131;een to carrie the Beer or Coffin with the Corps among the midle-earth Men to the Grave. Some Men of that exalted Sight (whither by Art or Nature) have told me they have &#131;een at the&#131;e Meittings a Doubleman, or the Shape of &#131;ome Man in two places; that is, a &#131;uperterranean and a &#131;ubterranean Inhabitant, perfectly re&#131;embling one another in all Points, whom he notwith&#131;tanding could ea&#131;ily di&#131;tingui&#131;h one from another, by &#131;ome &#131;ecret Tockens and Operations, and &#131;o go &#131;peak to the Man his Neighbour and Familiar, pa&#131;&#131;ing by the Apparition or Re&#131;emblance of him. They avouch that every Element and different State of Being have Animals re&#131;embling the&#131;e of another Element; as there be Fi&#131;hes &#131;ometimes at Sea re&#131;embling Monks of late Order in all their Hoods and Dre&#131;&#131;es; &#131;o as the Roman invention of good and bad D&aelig;mons, and guardian Angells particularly a&#131;&#131;igned, is called by them an ignorant Mi&#131;take, &#131;prung only from this Originall. They call this Reflex-man a Co-walker, every way like the</P>

They avouch that a Heluo, or Great-eater, hath a voracious Elve to be his attender, called a Joint-eater or Ju&#131;t-halver, feeding on the Pith or Quinte&#131;&#131;ence of what the Man eats; and that therefoir he continues Lean like a Hawke or Heron, notwith &#131;tanding his devouring Appetite: yet it would &#131;eem that they convey that &#131;ub&#131;tance el&#131;ewhere, for the&#131;e Subterraneans eat but little in their Dwellings; there Food being exactly clean, and &#131;erved up by Plea&#131;ant Children, lyke inchanted Puppets. What Food they extract from us is conveyed to their Homes by &#131;ecret Paths, as &#131;ume &#131;kilfull Women do the Pith and Milk from their Neighbours Cows into their own Chiefe-hold thorow a Hair-tedder, at a great Di&#131;tance, by Airt Magic, or by drawing a &#131;pickot fa&#131;tened to a Po&#131;t which will bring milk as farr of as a Bull will be heard to roar.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The Chiefe made of the remaineing Milk of a Cow thus &#131;train'd will &#131;wim in Water like a Cork.
