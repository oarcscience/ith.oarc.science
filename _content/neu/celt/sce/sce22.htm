<P>12. As our Religion oblidges us not to make a peremptory and curious Search into the&#131;e Ob&#131;tru&#131;ene&#131;&#131;es, &#131;o that the Hi&#131;tories of all Ages give as many plain Examples of extraordinary</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Occurrances</P>
<P><A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Occurrances as make a mode&#131;t Inquiry not contemptable. How much is written of Pigme's, Fairies, Nymphs, Syrens, Apparitions, which tho not the tenth Part true, yet could not &#131;pring of nothing! Even Engli&#131;h Authors relate (of) Barry I&#131;land, in Glamorgan&#131;hire, that laying your Ear into a Clift of the Rocks, blowing of Bellows, &#131;tricking of Hammers, cla&#131;hing of Armour, fyling of Iron, will be heard di&#131;tinctly ever &#131;ince Merlin inchaunted tho&#131;e &#131;ubterranean Wights to a &#131;olid manuall forging of Arm's to Aurelius Ambro&#131;ius and his Brittans, till he returned; which Merlin being killed in a Battell, and not coming to loo&#131;e the Knot, the&#131;e active Vulcans are there ty'd to a perpetuall Labour. But to dip no deeper into this Well, I will nixt give &#131;ome Account how the Seer my Informer comes to have this &#131;ecret Way of Corre&#131;pondence beyond other Mortalls.</P>
<P>THERE be odd Solemnities at inve&#131;ting a Man with the Priviledges of the whole Mi&#131;tery of this Second Sight. He mu&#131;t run a Tedder of Hair (which bound a Corps to the Bier) in a Helix [?] about his Midle, from End to End;</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">then</P>
<P><A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A></P>
<P>then bow his Head downwards, as did Elijah, 1 Kings, 18. 42. and look back thorough his Legs untill he &#131;ie a Funerall advance till the People cro&#131;s two Marches; or look thus back thorough a Hole where was a Knot of Fir. But if the Wind change Points while the Hair Tedder is ty'd about him, he is in Peril of his Lyfe. The u&#131;ewall Method for a curious Per&#131;on to get a tran&#131;ient Sight of this otherwi&#131;e invi&#131;ible Crew of Subterraneans, (if impotently and over ra&#131;hly &#131;ought,) is to put his [left Foot under the Wizard's right] Foot, and the Seer's Hand is put on the Inquirer's Head, who is to look over the Wizard's right Shoulder, (which hes ane ill Appearance, as if by this Ceremony ane implicit Surrender were made of all betwixt the Wizard's Foot and his Hand, ere the Per&#131;on can be admitted a privado to the Airt;) then will he &#131;ee a Multitude of Wight's, like furious hardie Men, flocking to him hai&#131;tily from all Quarters, as thick as Atoms in the Air; which are no Nonentities or Phanta&#131;ms, Creatures proceiding from ane affrighted Apprehen&#131;ione, confu&#131;ed or crazed Sen&#131;e, but Realities, appear-</P>

<P>ing to a &#131;table Man in his awaking Sen&#131;e, and enduring a rationall Tryall of their Being. Thes thorow Fear &#131;trick him breathle&#131;s and &#131;peechle&#131;s. The Wizard, defending the Lawfullne&#131;s of his Skill, forbids &#131;uch Horror, and comforts his Novice by telling of Zacharias, as being &#131;truck &#131;peechle&#131;s at &#131;eeing Apparitions, Luke, 1. 20. Then he further maintains his Airt, by vouching Eli&#131;ha to have had the &#131;ame, and di&#131;clo&#131;'d it thus unto his Servant in 2 Kings, 6. 17. when he blinded the Syrians; and Peter in Act, 5. 9. for&#131;eing the Death of Saphira, by perceaving as it were her Winding-&#131;heet about her before hand; and Paul, in 2nd Corinth. 12. 4. who got &#131;uch a Vi&#131;ion and Sight as &#131;hould not, nor could be told. Eli&#131;ha al&#131;o in his Chamber &#131;aw Gehazi his Servant, at a great Di&#131;tance, taking a reward from Naaman, 2d Kings, 5. 26. Hence were the Prophets frequently called SEERS, or Men of a 2d or more exhalted Sight than others. He acts for his Purpo&#131;e al&#131;o Math. 4. 8. where the Devil undertakes to give even Je&#131;us a Sight of all Nations, and the fine&#131;t Things in the World, at one Glance, tho in</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">their</P>
<P><A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></P>
<P>their naturall Situations and Stations at a va&#131;t Di&#131;tance from other. And 'tis &#131;aid expre&#131;ly he did let &#131;ie them; not in a Map it &#131;eems, nor by a phanta&#131;tick magicall jugling of the Sight, which he could not impo&#131;e upon &#131;o di&#131;covering a Per&#131;on. It would appear then to have been a Sight of real &#131;olid Sub&#131;tances, and Things of worth, which he intended as a Bait for his Purpo&#131;e. Whence it might &#131;eem, (compairing this Relation of Math. 4. 8. with the former,) that the extraordinary or Second Sight can be given by the Mini&#131;tery of bad as weill as good Spirits to tho&#131;e that will embrace it. And the In&#131;tance of Balaam and the Pytheni&#131;s make it nothing the le&#131;s probable. Thus al&#131;o the Seer trains his Scholler, by telling of the Gradations of Nature, ordered by a wi&#131;e Provydence; that as the Sight of Bats and Owls tran&#131;cend that of Shrews and Moles, &#131;o the vi&#131;ive Faculties of Men are clearer than tho&#131;e of Owls; as Eagles, Lynxs, and Cats are brighter than Mens. And again, that Men of the Second Sight (being de&#131;igned to give warnings again&#131;t &#131;ecret Engyns) &#131;urpa&#131;s the ordinary Vi&#131;ion of other</P>
