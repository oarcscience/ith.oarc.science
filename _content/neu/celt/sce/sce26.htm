<P>SIR,</P>
<P>I HEARD very much, but beleived very little, of the Second Sight; yet its being a&#131;&#131;umed</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">by</P>
<P><A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A></P>
<P>by &#131;everall of great Veracity, I was induced to make Inquirie after it in the Year 1652, being then confin'd to abide in the North of Scotland by the Engli&#131;h U&#131;urpers. The more generall Accounts of it were, that many Highlanders, yet far more I&#131;landers, were qualified with this Second Sight; that Men, Women, and Children, indi&#131;tinctly, were &#131;ubject to it, and Children, where Parents were not. Some times People came to age, who had it not when young, nor could any tell by what Means produced. It is a Trouble to mo&#131;t of them who are &#131;ubject to it, and they would be rid of it any Rate if they could. The Sight is of no long Duration, only continuing &#131;o long as they can keep their Eyes &#131;teady without twinkling. The hardy therefore fix their look, that they may &#131;ee the longer; but the timorous &#131;ee only Glances, their Eyes always twinkles at the fir&#131;t Sight of the Object. That which generally is &#131;een by them, are the Species of living Creatures, and of inanimate Things, which was in Motion, &#131;uch as Ships, and Habits upon Per&#131;ons. They never &#131;ie the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A></P>
<P>the Species of any Per&#131;on who is already dead. What they foir&#131;ie fails not to exi&#131;t in the Mode, and in that Place where it appears to them. They cannot well know what Space of Time &#131;hall interveen between the Apparition and the real Exi&#131;tance: But &#131;ome of the hardie&#131;t and longe&#131;t Experience have &#131;ome Rules for Conjectures; as, if they &#131;ie a Man with a &#131;hrowding Sheet in the Apparition, they will conjecture at the Nearne&#131;s or Remotene&#131;s of his Death by the more or le&#131;s of his Bodie that is covered by it. They will ordinarily &#131;ie their ab&#131;ent Friends, tho at a great Di&#131;tance, &#131;ome tymes no le&#131;s than from America to Scotland, &#131;itting, &#131;tanding, or walking in &#131;ome certain Place; and then they conclude with a A&#131;&#131;urance that they will &#131;ie them &#131;o and there. If a Man be in love with a Woman, they will ordinarily &#131;ie the Species of that Man &#131;tanding by her, and &#131;o likewi&#131;e if a Woman be in love; and they conjecture at their Enjoyments (of each other) by the Species touching (of) the Per&#131;on, or appearing at a Di&#131;tance from her (if they enjoy not one another.) If they &#131;ie</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></P>
<P>the Species of any Per&#131;on who is &#131;ick to die, they &#131;ie them covered over with the &#131;hrowding Sheet.</P>
<P>THESE Generalls I had verified to me by &#131;uch of them as did &#131;ie, and were e&#131;teemed hone&#131;t and &#131;ober by all the Neighbourhood; for I inquired after &#131;uch for my Information. And becau&#131;e there were more of the&#131;e Seers in the I&#131;les of Lewis, Harris, and Ui&#131;t, than in any other Place, I did entreat Sir James M'Donald (who is now dead) Sir Normand M'Loud, and Mr. Daniel Mori&#131;on, a verie hone&#131;t Per&#131;on, (who are &#131;till alive,) to make Inquirie in this uncouth Sight, and to acquaint me therewith; which they did, and all found ane Agriement in the&#131;e Generalls, and informed me of many In&#131;tances confirming what they &#131;aid. But though Men of Di&#131;cretion and Honour, being but at 2d Hand, I will choo&#131;e rather to put my&#131;elf than my Friends on the Hazard of being laughed at for incredible Relations.</P>
<P>I WAS once travelling in the Highlands, and a good Number of Servants with me, as is u&#131;uall</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">there</P>
<P><A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A></P>
<P>there; and one of them going a little before me, entering into a Hou&#131;e where I was to &#131;tay all Night, and going hai&#131;tily to the Door, he &#131;uddenly &#131;tept back with a Screech, and did fall by a Stone, which hit his Foot. I a&#131;ked what the Matter was, for he &#131;eemed to be very much frighted. He told me very &#131;eriou&#131;ly that I &#131;hould not lodge in that Hou&#131;e, becau&#131;e &#131;hortly a dead Coffin would be carried out of it, for many were carrying of it when he was heard cry. I neglecting his Words, and &#131;taying there, he &#131;aid to other of his Servants, he was &#131;orry for it, and that &#131;urely what he &#131;aw would &#131;hortly come to pa&#131;s. Tho no &#131;ick Per&#131;on was then there, yet the Landlord, a healthy Highlander, died of ane appoplectick Fit before I left the Hou&#131;e.</P>
<P>In the year 1653, Alexander Monro (afterward Lieut. Coll. to the Earl of Dunbarton's Regiment,) and I were walking in a Place called Ullabill, in Lochbroom, on a little Plain, at the Foot of a rugged Hill. There was a Servant working with a Spade in the Walk before us; his Back was to us, and his Face to</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></P>
<P>the Hill. Before we came to him, he let the Spade fall, and looked toward the Hill. He took Notice of us as wee pa&#131;&#131;ed neer by him, which made me look at him; and perceiving him to &#131;tair a little &#131;trangely, I conjectured him to be a Seer. I called at him, at which he &#131;tarted and &#131;miled. What are you doing? &#131;aid I. He an&#131;wered, I have &#131;een a very &#131;trange Thing; ane Army of Engli&#131;hmen, leeding of Hor&#131;es, coming doun that Hill; and a Number of them are come down to the Plain, and eating the Barley, which is growing in the Field neer to the Hill. This was on the 4th May, (for I notted the Day,) and it was four or fyve Days before the Barley was &#131;own in the Field he &#131;poke of. Alexander Monro a&#131;ked him how he knew they were Engli&#131;hmen? He &#131;aid, becau&#131;e they were leeding of Hor&#131;es, and had on Hats and Bootts, which he knew no Scot Man would have there. We took little Notice of the whole Storie, as other than a fooli&#131;h Vi&#131;ion; but wi&#131;hed that ane Engli&#131;h Partie were there, we being then at Warr with them, and the Place almo&#131;t unacce&#131;lable for Hor&#131;e-</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">men</P>
<P><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></P>
<P>men. But in the Beginning of Augu&#131;t therafter, the Earle of Midleton (then Lieut. for the King in the Highlands) having occa&#131;ion to march a Party of his toward the South Highlands, he &#131;ent his Foot thorow a Place called Inverlawell; and the Fore-partie which was fir&#131;t down the Hill, did fall off eating the Barley which was on the litle Plain under it. And Monro calling to mynd what the Seer told us, in May preceiding, he wrote of it, and &#131;ent ane Expre&#131;s to me to Loch&#131;lin, in Ro&#131;s, (where I then was) with it.</P>
<P>I HAD Occa&#131;ion once to be in Companie where a Young Lady was, (excu&#131;e my not naming of Per&#131;ons,) and I was told there was a notable Seer in the Companie. I called him to &#131;peak with me, as I did ordinarly when I found any of them; and after he had an&#131;wered me to &#131;everal Que&#131;tions, I a&#131;ked if he knew any Per&#131;on to be in love with that Lady. He &#131;aid he did, but he knew not the Per&#131;on; for during the two Dayes he had been in her Company, he perceaved one &#131;tanding neer her, and his Head leaning on her Shoulder; which he &#131;aid</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">did</P>
<P><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></P>
<P>did fore-tell that the Man &#131;hould marrie her, and die before her, according to his Ob&#131;ervation. This was in the Year 1655. I de&#131;ired him to de&#131;cribe the Per&#131;on, which he did; &#131;o that I could conjecture, by the De&#131;cription, of &#131;uch a one, who was of that Ladyes Acquaintance, tho there were no thought of their Marriage till two Years thereafter. And having Occa&#131;ion, in the Year 1657, to find this Seer, who was ane I&#131;lander, in Company with the other Per&#131;on whom I conjectured to have been de&#131;cribed by him, I called him a&#131;ide, and a&#131;ked if that was the Per&#131;on he &#131;aw be&#131;ide the Lady near two Years then pa&#131;t. He &#131;aid it was he indeed, for he had &#131;een that Lady ju&#131;t then &#131;tanding by him Hand in Hand. This was &#131;ome few Months before their Marriage, and that Man is &#131;ince dead, and the Lady &#131;till alive.</P>
<P>I SHALL trouble you but with one more, which I thought mo&#131;t remarkable of any that occurred to me. In January 1652, the above mentioned Lieut. Coll. Alex. Monro and I happened to be in the Hou&#131;e of one Wm. M'Cleud of Ferrinlea, in the County of Ro&#131;s.</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">He</P>
<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> He, the Landlord, and I were &#131;itting in three Chairs neir the Fire, and in the Corner of the great Chimney there were two I&#131;landers, who were that verie Night come to the Hous, and were related to the Landlord. While the one of them was talking with Monro, I perceaved the other to look oddly toward me. From this Look, and his being ane I&#131;lander, I conjectured him a Seer, and a&#131;ked him, at what he &#131;tair'd? He an&#131;wered, by de&#131;iring me to ri&#131;e from that Chair, for it was ane unluckie one. I a&#131;ked him why. He an&#131;wered, becau&#131;e there was a dead Man in the Chair nixt to me. Well, &#131;aid I, if it be in the nixt Chair, I may keep mine own. But what is the Likne&#131;s of the Man? He &#131;aid he was a tall Man, with a long Grey Coat, booted, and one of his Legs hanging over the Arme of the Chair, and his head hanging dead to the other Side, and his Arme backward, as if it were brocken. There were &#131;ome Engli&#131;h Troops then quartered near that Place, and there being at that Time a great Fro&#131;t after a Thaw, the Country was covered all over with Yce. Four or Fyve of the Engli&#131;h ryding by</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">this</P>
<P><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></P>
<P>this Hou&#131;e &#131;ome two Hours after the Vi&#131;ion, while we were &#131;itting by the Fire, we heard a great Noi&#131;e, which prov'd to be tho&#131;e Troopers, with the Help of other Servants, carrying in one of their Number, who had got a very mi&#131;cheivous Fall, and had his Arme broke; and falling frequently in &#131;wooning Fits, they brought him into the Hall, and &#131;et him in the verie Chair, and in the verie Po&#131;ture that the Seer had prophe&#131;ied. But the Man did not die, though he recovered with great Difficulty.</P>
<P>AMONG the Accounts given me by Sir Normand M'clud, there was one worth of &#131;pecial Notice, which was thus. There [was] a Gentleman in the I&#131;le of Harris, who was always &#131;een by the Seers with ane Arrow in his Thigh. Such in the I&#131;le who thought tho&#131;e progno&#131;tications infalliable, did not doubt but he would be &#131;hot in the Thigh before he died. Sir Normand told me that he heard it the Subject of their Di&#131;cour&#131;e for many Years. At la&#131;t he died without any &#131;uch Accident. Sir Normand was at his Buriall, at St Clement's Church in the Harris. At the &#131;ame Time, the Corps of another</P>
<P><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></P>
<P>another Gentleman was brought to be buried in the &#131;ame verie Church. The Friends on either Side came to debate who &#131;hould fir&#131;t enter the Church, and in a Trice from Words they came to Blows. One of the Number (who was arm'd with Bow and Arrows) let one fly among them. (Now everie Familie in that I&#131;le have their Buriall-place in the Church in Stone Che&#131;ts, and the Bodies are carried in open Biers to the Buriall-place.) Sir Normand having appea&#131;ed the Tumult, one of the Arrows was found &#131;hot in the dead Man's Thigh. To this Sir Normand was a Witne&#131;s.</P>
<P>IN the Account which Mr Daniel Mori&#131;on, Par&#131;on in the Lewis, gave me, there was one, tho it be hetergeneous from the &#131;ubject, yet it may [be] worth your Notice. It was of a young Woman in his Pari&#131;h, who was mightily frightned by &#131;eeing her own Image &#131;till before her, alwayes when &#131;he came to the open Air; the Back of the Image being alwayes to her, &#131;o that it was not a reflection as in a Mirrour, but the Species of &#131;uch a Body as her own, and in a very like Habit, which appeared to her&#131;elf</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">continually</P>
<P><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></P>
<P>continually before her. The Par&#131;on keept her a long whyle with him, but had no Remedy of her Evill, which troubled her exceidingly. I was told afterwards, that when &#131;he was four or fyve Years elder &#131;he &#131;aw it not.</P>
<P>THESE are Matters of Fact, which I a&#131;&#131;ure yow they are truely related. But the&#131;e, and all others that occurred to me, by Information or otherwi&#131;e, could never lead me into a remote Conjecture of the Cau&#131;e of &#131;o extraordinary a Ph&aelig;nomenon. Whither it be a Quality in the Eyes of &#131;ome People into the&#131;e Pairts, concurring with a Quality in the Air al&#131;o; whither &#131;uch Species be every where, tho not &#131;een by the Want of Eyes &#131;o qualified, or from whatever other Cau&#131;e, I mu&#131;t leave to the Inquiry of clearer judgements than mine. But a Hint may be taken from this image which appeared &#131;till to this Woman abovementioned, and from another mentioned by Ari&#131;totle, in the 4th of his Metaphy&#131;icks (if I remember right, for it is long &#131;ince I read it;) as al&#131;o from the common Opinion that young Infants (un&#131;ullied with many Objects) do &#131;ie Appearitions, which were</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">not</P>
<P><A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></P>
<P>not &#131;een by tho&#131;e of elder Years; as like wife from this, that &#131;everalls did &#131;ie the Second Sight when in the Highlands or I&#131;les, yet when tran&#131;ported to live in other Countreys, e&#131;pecially in America, they quite lo&#131;e this Qualitie, as was told me by a Gentleman who knew &#131;ome of them in Barbadoes, who did &#131;ee no Vi&#131;ion there, altho he knew them to be Seers when they lived in the I&#131;les of Scotland.</P>
