This is one of the most sought after and enigmatic texts about
Celtic fairies.
Written by a Scottish clergyman, Robert Kirk, in 1691, and not committed
to print until the early 19th century, <I>The Secret Commonwealth</I>
is an unusually sympathetic account of the denizens of fairyland,
and a complex of still mysterious extrasensory phenomena including
poltergeists, clairvoyance and doppelgangers (here called 'co-walkers').
</P>

<P>
This version was issued in 1893 in a very limited edition by the
renowned folklorist Andrew Lang, and it includes a 'comment'
and some endnotes by Lang which are
actually about as long as the Kirk material.
This book is very rare.
I was extremely fortunate to acquire a copy of the first
(and to my knowledge, only)
edition of this work when it came up for sale at a local used bookstore.
This copy is signed on the flyleaf
by Uma Jeffers, wife of the poet Robinson Jeffers, and bears
their bookmark, "The Hawk Tower, Tor House, Carmel-by-the-Sea".
</P>
<P>
The only version of Kirk recently in print was converted
to modern spelling, and it is unlikely that Lang's edition will be readily
available to scholars and other interested individuals, unless it is
reprinted.
Therefore I have taken great pains to retain the spelling
and formatting of Lang's redaction of Kirk's text.
I have departed from site standards in this section and not
merged cross-page hyphenated words.
By far the stickiest issue was Kirk's spelling, particularly the 'long' s,
which in Lang's book was indistinguishable from normal f.
I have used the &#131; character (&amp;#131;) throughout where I
could infer the presence of an 's'.
In some rare cases I could not decide whether
an 'f' or an 's' was implied; these are noted in green italic type.
(Annotations in Kirk with square brackets are Lang's).
