<P>My LORD, after narrow Inqui&#131;ition, hath delivered many true and remarkable ob&#131;erves on this Subject; yet to encourage a further Scrutiny, I crave leave to &#131;ay,</P>
<P>THAT 1. But a few Women are endued with this Sight in re&#131;pect of Men, and their Predictions not &#131;o certane.</P>
<P>2. This Sight is not criminal, &#131;ince a Man can come by it unawares, and without his Con&#131;ent; but it is certaine he &#131;ie more fatall and fearfull Things than he do glad&#131;ome.</P>
<P>3. THE Seers avouch, that &#131;everalls who go</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">to</P>
<P><A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A></P>
<P>to the <I>Siths</I>, (or People at Re&#131;t, and, in re&#131;pect of us, in Peace,) before the natural Period of their Lyfe expyre, do frequently appear to them.</P>
<P>4. A VEHEMENT De&#131;yre to attain this Airt is very helpfull to the Inquyrer; and the Species of ane Ab&#131;ent Friend, which appears to the Seers, as clearly as if he had &#131;ent his lively Picture to pre&#131;ent it &#131;elfe before him, is no phanta&#131;tick Shaddow of a &#131;ick Apprehen&#131;ion, but a reality, and a Me&#131;&#131;inger, coming for unknown Rea&#131;ons, not from the originall Similitude of it &#131;elfe, but from a more &#131;wift and pragmantick People, which recreat them &#131;elves in offering &#131;ecret Intelligence to Men, tho generally they are unacquainted with that Kind of Corre&#131;pondence, as if they had lived in a different element from them.</P>
<P>5. THO my Collections were written long before I &#131;aw My Lord of Tarbett's, yet I am glad that his de&#131;criptions and mine corre&#131;pond &#131;o nearly. The Maid my Lord mentions, who &#131;aw her Image &#131;till before her, &#131;uteth with the CO-WALKER named in my Account; which tho</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">&#131;ome</P>
<P><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></P>
<P>&#131;ome, at fir&#131;t Thought, might conjecture to be by the Refraction of a Cloud or Mi&#131;t, as in the Parelij, (the whole Air and every Drop of Water being a Mirrour to returne the Species of Things, were our vi&#131;ive Faculty &#131;harpe enough to apprehend them,) or a naturall Reflexion, from the &#131;ame Rea&#131;ons that an Echo can be redoubled by Airt; yet it were more fa&#131;able (<FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>(?) fafable in original--JBH</I></FONT>) to impute this Second Sight to a Quality infu&#131;ed into the Eye by ane Unction: for Witchies have a &#131;leepie Oyntment, that, when applyed, troubles their Fanta&#131;ies, advancing it to have unu&#131;uall Figures and Shapes repre&#131;ented to it, as if it were a Fit of Fanatici&#131;m, Hypocondriack Melancholly, or Po&#131;&#131;e&#131;&#131;ion of &#131;ome in&#131;inuating Spirit, rai&#131;ing the Soul beyond its common Strain, if the palpable In&#131;tances and Realities &#131;een, and innocently objected to the Sen&#131;es did not di&#131;prove it, make the Matter a palpable Verity, and no Deception; yet &#131;ince this Sight can be be&#131;towed without Oyntment, or dangerous Compact, the Qualification is not of &#131;o bad an Originall. Therefore,</P>
<P>6. By my Lord's good Leave, I pre&#131;ume to</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">&#131;ay</P>
<P><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></P>
<P>&#131;ay, that this Sight can be no Quality of the Air nor of the Eyes; becaus, 1. such as live in the &#131;ame Air, and &#131;ie all other Things as farr off and as clearly, yet have not the SECOND SIGHT. 2. A SEER can give another Per&#131;on this Sight tran&#131;iently, by putting his Hand and Foot in the Po&#131;ture he requires of him. 3. The un&#131;ullied Eyes of Infants can naturally perceave no new unaccu&#131;tomed Objects, but what appear to other Men, unle&#131;s exalted and clarified &#131;ome Way, as Ballaam's A&#131;s for a Time; tho in a Witches Eye the Beholder cannot &#131;ie his own Image reflected, as in the Eyes of other People; &#131;o that Defect of Objects, as well as Diver&#131;ities of the Subject, may appear differently on &#131;everall Tempers and Ages. 4. Tho al&#131;o &#131;ome are of &#131;o venemous a Con&#131;titution, by being radicated in Envy and Malice, that they pierce and kill (like a Cockatrice) whatever Creature they fir&#131;t &#131;et their Eye on in the Morning; &#131;o was it with Walter Grahame, &#131;ome Time living in the Paroch wherein now I am, who killed his own Cow after commending its Fatne&#131;s, and</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">&#131;hot</P>
<P><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></P>
<P>&#131;hot a Hair with his Eyes, having prai&#131;ed its &#131;wiftne&#131;s, (&#131;uch was the Infection of ane evill Eye;) albeit this was unu&#131;uall, yet he &#131;aw no Object but what was obvious to other Men as well as to him&#131;elfe. 5. If the being tran&#131;ported to live in another Countrey did ob&#131;cure the Second Sight, nather the Par&#131;on nor the Maid needed be much troubled for her Reflex-&#131;elfe; a little Peregrination, and going from her wonted Home, would have &#131;alved her Fear. Wherefore,</P>
<P>7. SINCE the Things &#131;een by the Seers are real Entities, the Pre&#131;ages and Predictions found true, but a few endued with this Sight, and tho&#131;e not of bad Lyves, or addicted to Malifices, the true Solution of the Ph&aelig;nomenon &#131;eems rather to be, the courteous Endeavours of our fellow Creatures in the Invi&#131;ible World to convince us, (in Oppo&#131;ition to Sadduce's, Socinians, and Athei&#131;ts,) of a Deity; of Spirits; of a po&#131;&#131;ible and harmle&#131;s Method of Corre&#131;pondence betwixt Men and them, even in this Lyfe; of their Operation for our Caution and Warning; of the Orders and Degrees</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">of</P>
<P><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></P>
<P>of Angells, whereof one Order, with Bodies of Air conden&#131;ed and curiou&#131;ly &#131;hap't, may be nixt to Man, &#131;uperior to him in Under&#131;tanding, yet unconfirmed; and of their Region, Habitation, and Influences on Man, greater than that of Starrs on inanimat Bodies; a Knowledge (belike) re&#131;erved for the&#131;e la&#131;t athei&#131;tick Ages, wherein the Profanity of Mens Lives hath debauched and blinded their Under&#131;tanding, as to MOSES, JESUS, and the Prophets, (unle&#131;s they get Convictions from Things formerly known,) as from the Regions of the Dead: nor doth the cea&#131;ing of the Vi&#131;ions, upon the Seers Tran&#131;migration into forrein Kingdoms, make his Lord&#131;hip's Conjecture of the Quality of the Air and Eye a white (<FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>while (?)--JBH</I></FONT>) the more probable; but, on the Contrary, it confirms greatly my Account of ane Invi&#131;ible People, guardian over and care-full of Men, who have their different Offices and Abilities in di&#131;tinct Counterey's, as appears in Dan. 10. 13. viz. about I&#131;raels, Grecia's, and Per&#131;ia's a&#131;&#131;i&#131;tant Princes, whereof who &#131;o prevaileth giveth Dominion and A&#131;cendant to his Pupills and Va&#131;&#131;alls over</P>

<P>the oppo&#131;ite Armies and Countreys; &#131;o that every Countrey and Kingdom having their topical Spirits, or Powers a&#131;&#131;i&#131;ting and governing them, the SCOTTISH SEER bani&#131;hed to America, being a Stranger there, as well to the invi&#131;ible as to the vi&#131;ible Inhabitants, and wanting a Fimiliarity of his former Corre&#131;pondents, he could not have the Favour and Warnings, by the &#131;everall Vi&#131;ions and Predictions which were wont to be granted him by the&#131;e Acquantances and Favourites in his own Countrey. For if what he wont to &#131;ie were Realities, (as I have made appear,) 'twere too great ane Honour for Scotland to have &#131;uch &#131;eldom-&#131;een Watchers and predominant Powers over it alone, acting in it &#131;o expre&#131;&#131;ly, and all other Nations wholly de&#131;titute of the lyke; tho, without all peradventure, all other People wanted the right Key of their Cabinet, and the exact Method of Corre&#131;pondence with them, except the &#131;agacious active Scots, as many of them have retained it of a long Time, and by Surpry&#131;es and Raptures do often foirtell what in Kyndne&#131;s is really repre&#131;ented to them at</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">&#131;everall</P>
<P><A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A></P>
<P>&#131;everall Occa&#131;ions. To which Purpo&#131;e the learned lynx-ey'd Mr. Baxter, on Rev. 12. 7. writting of the Fight betwixt Michaell and the Dragon, gives a verie pertinent Note, viz. That he knows not but ere any great Action (e&#131;peciall tragicall) is don on Earth, that fir&#131;t the Battell and Victory is acted and atchieved in the Air betwixt the good and evill Spirits: Thus he. It &#131;eems the&#131;e were the mens Guardians; and the lyke Battells are oft tymes perceav'd in a Loaft (<FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>sic--JBH</I></FONT>) in the Nycht-time; the Event of which myght ea&#131;ily be repre&#131;ented by &#131;ome one of the Number to a Corre&#131;pondent on Earth, as frequently the Report of great Actions have been more &#131;wiftly caried to other Countreys than all the Airt of us Mortals could po&#131;&#131;ibly di&#131;patch it. St. Au&#131;tine, (<FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><I>Augustine?--JBH</I></FONT>) on Mark, 9. 4. giveth no &#131;mall Intimation of this Truth, averring that Elias appeared with Je&#131;us on the Mount in his proper Bodie, but Mo&#131;es in ane aereall Bodie, a&#131;&#131;umed like the Angels who appeared, and had Ability to eat with Abraham, tho no Nece&#131;&#131;ity on the Account of their Bodies. As lyke wife the late Doctrine of the Pre-exi&#131;tence</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">of</P>
<P><A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></P>
<P>of Souls, living into aereall Vehicles, gives a &#131;ingular Hint of the Po&#131;&#131;ibility of the Thing, if not a direct Prooff of the whole A&#131;&#131;ertion; which yet moreover may be illuminated by diver&#131;e other In&#131;tances of the lyke Nature, and as wonderfull, be&#131;ides what is above &#131;aid. As,</P>
<P>8. THE invi&#131;ible Wights which haunt Hou&#131;es &#131;eem rather to be &#131;ome of our &#131;ubterranean Inhabitants, (which appear often to Men of the Second Sight,) than evill Spirits or Devills; becau&#131;e, tho they throw great Stones, Pieces of Earth and Wood, at the Inhabitants, they hurt them not at all, as if they acted not malitiou&#131;ly, like Devills at all, but in Sport, lyke Buffoons and Drolls. All Ages have affoorded &#131;ome ob&#131;cure Te&#131;timonies of it, as Pythagoras his Doctrine of Tran&#131;migration; Socrates's D&aelig;mon that gave him [Warning] of future Dangers; Platoe's cla&#131;&#131;ing them into various vehiculated Specie&#131;es of Spirits; Dioni&#131;ius Areopagita's mar&#131;halling nyne Orders of Spirits, &#131;uperiour and &#131;ubordinate; the Poets their borrowing of the Philo&#131;ophers, and add-</P>

<P>ing their own Fancies of Fountain, River, and Sea Nymphs, Wood, Hill, and Montain Inhabitants, and that every Place and Thing, in Cities and Countreys, had &#131;peciall invi&#131;ible regular Gods and Governours. Cardan &#131;peaks of his Father his &#131;eeing the Species of his Friend, in a moon-&#131;hyn Night, riding fiercely by his Window on a white Hor&#131;e, the verie Night his Friend dy'd at a Va&#131;t Di&#131;tance from him; by which he under&#131;tood that &#131;ome Alteration would &#131;uddenly en&#131;ue. Cornelius Aggrippa, and the learned Dr. Mor, have &#131;everall Pa&#131;&#131;ages tending that Way. The Noctambulo's them&#131;elves would appear to have &#131;ome forrein joquing Spirit po&#131;&#131;e&#131;&#131;ing and &#131;upporting them, when they walk on deep Waters and Topes of Hou&#131;es without Danger, when a&#131;leep and in the dark; for it was no way probable that their Apprehen&#131;ion, and &#131;trong Imagination &#131;etting the Animal Spirits a work to move the Body, could pre&#131;erve it from &#131;inking in the Deepth, or falling down head-long, when a&#131;leep, any more than when awake, the Body being then as ponderous as before; and it is hard</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">to</P>
<P><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></P>
<P>to attribute it to a Spirit flatelie evill and Enemy to Man, becau&#131;e the Noctambulo returns to his own Place &#131;afe. And the mo&#131;t furious Tribe of the D&aelig;mons are not permitted by Providence to attacke Men &#131;o frequently either by Night or by Day: For in our Highlands, as there may be many fair Ladies of this aereal Order, which do often try&#131;t with la&#131;civious young Men, in the quality of Succubi, or light&#131;ome Paramours and Strumpets, called <I>Leannain Sith</I>, or familiar Spirits (in Dewter. 18. 11.); &#131;o do many of our Hyghlanders, as if a &#131;trangling by the Night MARE, pre&#131;&#131;ed with a fearfull. Dream, or rather po&#131;&#131;e&#131;&#131;ed by one of our aereall Neighbours, ri&#131;e up fierce in the Night, and apprehending the neere&#131;t Weapons, do pu&#131;h and thru&#131;t at all Per&#131;ons in the &#131;ame Room with them, &#131;ometymes wounding their own Comerades to dead. The lyke whereof fell &#131;adly out within a few Miles of me at the writting, hereof I add but one In&#131;tance more, of a very young Maid, who lived neir to my la&#131;t Re&#131;idence, that in one Night learned a large Peice of Poe&#131;y, by</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">the</P>

<P>the frequent Repetition of it, from one of our nimble and courteous Spirits, whereof a Part was pious, the re&#131;t &#131;uper&#131;titious, (for I have a Copy of it,) and no other Per&#131;on was ever heard to repeat it before, nor was the Maid capable to compo&#131;e it of her&#131;elf,</P>
<P>9. He demon&#131;trated and made evident to Sen&#131;e this extraordinary Vi&#131;ion of our Tramontain Seers, and what is &#131;een by them, by what is &#131;aid above, many haveing &#131;een this &#131;ame Spectres and Apparitions at once, haveing their vi&#131;ive Faculties entire; for <I>non e&#131;t di&#131;putandum de gu&#131;tu</I>. Itt now remaines to &#131;hew that it is not unfutable to Rea&#131;on nor the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>FIRST, That it is not repugnant to Rea&#131;on, doeth appear from this, that it is no le&#131;s &#131;trange for Immortal Sparks and Souls to come and be immer&#131;ed into gro&#131;s terre&#131;trial elementary Bodies, and be &#131;o propagated, &#131;o nouri&#131;hed, &#131;o fed, &#131;oe cloathed as they are, and breathe in &#131;uch ane Air and World prepared for them, then for Hollanders or Hollow-cavern Inhabitants to live and traffick among us, in another</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">State</P>
<P><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></P>
<P>State of Being, without our Knowledge. For Raymond de Subinde, in his 3d Booke, Chap. 12. argues quaintly, that all Sorts of Living Creatures have a happie rational Politie of there own, with great Contentment; which Government and mutual Conver&#131;e of theirs they all pride and pluim them&#131;elves, becau&#131;e it is as unknown to Man, as Man is to them. Much more, that the Sone of the HIGHEST SPIRIT &#131;hould a&#131;&#131;ume a Bodie like ours, convinces all the World that no other Thing that is po&#131;&#131;ible needs be much wondered at.</P>
<P>2. The Manucodiata, or Bird of Paradi&#131;e, living in the highe&#131;t Region of the Air; common Birds in the &#131;econd Region; Flies and In&#131;ects in the lowe&#131;t; Men and Bea&#131;ts on the Earth's Surface; Worms, Otters, Badgers, in Waters; lyke wi&#131;e Hell is inhabited at the Centre, and Heaven in the Circumference: can we then think the middle Cavities of the Earth emptie? I have &#131;een in Weems, (a Place in the Countie of Fyfe, in Scotland,) divers Caves cut out as va&#131;t Temples under Ground; the lyke is a Countie of England;</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">in</P>
<P><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></P>
<P>in Malta is a Cave, wherein Stons of a curious Cut are thrown in great Numbers every Day; &#131;o I have had barbed Arrow-heads of yellow Flint, that could not be cut &#131;o &#131;mall and neat, of &#131;o brittle a Sub&#131;tance, by all the Airt of Man. It would &#131;eem therefoir that the&#131;e mention'd Works were done by certaine Spirits of pure Organs, and not by Devills, who&#131;e continual Torments could not allow them &#131;o much Lea&#131;ure. Be&#131;ides the&#131;e, I have found fyve Curio&#131;ities in Scotland, not much ob&#131;erv'd to be el&#131;ewhere. 1. The Brounies, who in &#131;ome Families are Drudges, clean the Hou&#131;es and Di&#131;hes after all go to Bed, taking with him his Portion of Food and removing befor Day-break. 2. The Ma&#131;on Word, which tho &#131;ome make a Mi&#131;terie of it, I will not conceal a little of what I know. It is lyke a Rabbinical Tradition, in way of Comment on Jachin and Boaz, the two Pillars erected in Solomon's Temple, (1 Kings, 7. 21.) with ane Addition of &#131;ome &#131;ecret Signe delyvered from Hand to Hand, by which they know and become familiar one with another. 3. This Second</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Sight</P>
<P><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></P>
<P>Sight, &#131;o largely treated of before. 4. Charmes, and curing by them very many Di&#131;ea&#131;es, &#131;ometimes by transferring the Sicknes to another. 5. A being Proof of Lead, Iron, and Silver or a Brieve making Men invulnerable. Divers of our Scotti&#131;h Commanders and Souldiers have been &#131;een with blue Markes only, after they were &#131;hot with leaden Balls; which &#131;eems to be an Italian Trick, for they &#131;eem to be a People too currious and magically inclyned. Finally Iris-men, our Northern-Scoti&#131;h, and our Athole Men are &#131;o much addicted to and delighted with Harps and Mu&#131;ick, as if, like King Saul, they were po&#131;&#131;e&#131;&#131;ed with a forrein Spirit, only with this Difference, that Mu&#131;ick did put Saul's Pley-fellow a &#131;leep, but rou&#131;ed and awaked our Men, vanqui&#131;hing their own Spirits at Plea&#131;ure, as if they were impotent of its Powers, and unable to command it; for wee have &#131;een &#131;ome poor Beggers of them, chattering their Teeth for Cold, that how &#131;oon they &#131;aw the Fire, and heard the Harp, leapt thorow the Hou&#131;e like Goats and Satyrs. As there paralell Stories in all Countries and Ages</P>

<P>reported of the&#131;e our ob&#131;cure People, (which are no Dotages,) &#131;o is it no more of Nece&#131;&#131;itie to us fully to know their Beings and Manner of Life, then to under&#131;tand di&#131;tinctly the Politic of the nyne Orders of Angels; or with what Oyl the Lamp of the Sun is maintained &#131;o long and regularlie; or why the Moon is called a great Luminary in Scripture, while it only appears to be &#131;o; or if the Moon be truly inhabited, becau&#131;e Tele&#131;copes di&#131;cover Seas and Mountains in it, as well as flaming Furni&#131;hes in the Sun; or why the Di&#131;covery of America was look't on as a Fairie Tale, and the Reporters hooted at as Inventors of ridiculous Utopias, or the fir&#131;t probable A&#131;&#131;erters puni&#131;hed as Inventures of new Gods and Worlds; or why in England the King cures the Struma by &#131;troaking, and the Seventh Son in Scotland; whither his temperat Complexion conveys a Bal&#131;ome, and &#131;ucks out the corrupting Principles by a frequent warme &#131;anative Contact, or whither the Parents of the Seventh Child put furth a more eminent Virtue to his Production than to all the Re&#131;t, as being the</P>

<P><A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A></P>
<P>certain Meridian and hight to which their Vigour a&#131;cends, and from that furth have a graduall declyning into a feeblene&#131;s of the Bodie and its Production. And then, 1. Why is not the 7th Son infected him&#131;elfe by that Contagion he extracts from another? 2. How can continual &#131;troaking with a cold Hand have &#131;oe &#131;trong a natural Operation, as to exhale all the Infections warming corroding Vapours. 3. Why may not a 7th Daughter have the &#131;ame Vertue? So that it appears, albeit, a happie natural Con&#131;titution concurre, yet &#131;omething in it above Nature. Therefore every Age hath left &#131;ome &#131;ecret for its Di&#131;coverie; who knows but this Entercour&#131;e bewixt the two Kinds of rationall Inhabitants of the &#131;ame Earth may be not only beleived &#131;hortly, but as friely entertain'd, and as well known, as now the Airt of Navigation, Printing, Limning, riding on Saddles with Stirrups, and the Di&#131;coveries of Micro&#131;copes, which were &#131;ometimes a great a Wonder, and as hard to be beleived.</P>

The Legion or Brigad of Spirits (mentioned Mark, 5. 10.) be&#131;ought our Saviour not to &#131;end them away out of the Countrey; which &#131;hows they were D&AElig;MONES LOCI, Topical Spirits, and peculiar Superintendents and Supervi&#131;ors a&#131;&#131;ign'd to that Province. And the Power over the Nations granted (Rev. 2. 26.) to the Conquerors of Vice and Infidelitie, Sound &#131;omewhat to that Purpo&#131;e. Tobit had a D&aelig;mon attending Marriage, Chap. 6.

And in Philip. 2. 10. our verie Subterraneans are expre&#131;&#131;ly &#131;aid to bow to the Name of JESUS. Eli&#131;ha, not intellectually only, but &#131;en&#131;ibly, &#131;aw Gehazi when out of the Reach of ane ordinary View. It wants not good Evidents that there are more managed by God's Spirits, good, evill, and intermediate Spirits, among Men in this World, then we are aware of; the good Spirits inge&#131;ting fair and heroick Apprehen&#131;ions and Images of Vertue and the divyne Life, thereby animating us to act for a higher Happines, according to our Improvement; and relinqui&#131;hing us as &#131;trangely upon our Neglect, or our embraceing the deceatfull &#131;yrene-like Pictures and Repre&#131;entations of Plea&#131;ures and Gain, pre&#131;ented to our Imaginations by evill and &#131;portfull Angells, to allure to ane unthinking, ungenerous, and &#131;en&#131;ual Lyfe; non of them having power to compell us to any Mi&#131;demeanour without our flat Con&#131;ent.

<P>of ours being called a Warfair, and God's &#131;aying that at la&#131;t there will be no Peace to the Wicked, our bu&#131;&#131;ie and &#131;ilent Companions al&#131;o being called <I>Siths</I>, or <I>People at Re&#131;t and Quiet</I>, in re&#131;pect of us; and withall many Gho&#131;ts appearing to Men that want this Second Sight, in the very Shapes, and &#131;peaking the &#131;ame Language, they did when incorporate and alive with us; a Matter that is of ane old impre&#131;criptible Tradition, (<I>our Highlanders</I> making &#131;till a Di&#131;tinction betwixt <I>Sluagh Saoghalta</I> and <I>Sluagh Sith</I>, averring that the Souls goe to the <I>Sith</I> when di&#131;lodged;) many real Trea&#131;ures and Murders being di&#131;covered by Souls that pa&#131;s from among our &#131;elves, or by the Kindne&#131;s of the&#131;e our airie Neighbours, non of which Spirits can be altogither inorganical.

<P><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></P>
<P>of Monks doting and crazied Heads, our Creed &#131;aying that our Saviour de&#131;cended &#0949;&#7984;&#0962; &#8069;&#0948;&#0959;&#0965;, to the invi&#131;ible Place and People. And many Divines &#131;uppo&#131;ing that the Deity appear'd in a vi&#131;ible Shape &#131;een by Adam in the Cooll of the Day, and &#131;peaking to him with ane audible voice. And Je&#131;us, probably by the Mini&#131;tery of invi&#131;ible Attendants, conveying more meat of the &#131;ame Kind to the fyve Thow&#131;and that wes fed by him with a very few Loaves and Fi&#131;hes, (for a new Creation it was not.) The Zijmjiim and Ochim, in I&#131;a. 13. 21. 22. Thes Satyres, and doolfull unknown Creatures of I&#131;lands and De&#131;erts, &#131;eem to have a plain Pro&#131;pect that Way. Finally, the eternal Happine&#131;s enjoyed in the 3d Heavens, being more my&#131;terious than mo&#131;t of Men take it to be. It is not a &#131;en&#131;e whollie adduced to Scripture to &#131;ay, that this SIGHT, and the due Objects of it, hath &#131;ome Ve&#131;tige in holy Write, but rather 'tis mode&#131;tly deduced from it.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></P>
<P>QUESTION 1. How do you &#131;alve the Second Sight from Compact and Witchcraft?</P>
<P>ANSWER, Tho this Corre&#131;pondence with the Intermediate Unconfirm'd People (betwixt Man and Angell) be not ordinary to all of us who are Superterraneans, yet this SIGHT falling &#131;ome Per&#131;ons by Accident, and its being connatural to others from their Birth, the Derivation of it cannot always be wicked. A too great Curio&#131;itie, indeed, to acquyre any unnece&#131;&#131;ary Airt, may be blameworthy; but diver&#131;e of the SECRET COMMONWEALTH may, by Permi&#131;&#131;ion, di&#131;cover them&#131;elves as innocently to us, who are in another State, as &#131;ome of us Men do to Fi&#131;hes, which are in another Element, when we plunge and dive into the Bottom of the Seas, their native Region; and in Proce&#131;s of Time we may come to conver&#131;e as familiarly with the&#131;e nimble and agile Clans (but with greater Plea&#131;ure and Profit,) as we do now with the Chino's Antipodes.</P>
<P>QUESTION 2. Are they &#131;ubject to Vice, Lusts? Pa&#131;&#131;ion, and Inju&#131;tice, as we who live on the Surface of the Earth?</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">An&#131;wer</P>
<P><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></P>
<P>ANSWER. The Seers tell us that the&#131;e wandering Aereal People have not &#131;uch an Impetus and fatall Tendency to any Vice as Men, as not being drenched into &#131;o gro&#131;s and dregy Bodies as we, but yet are in ane imperfect State, and &#131;ome of them making better E&#131;&#131;ays for heroick Actions than others; having the &#131;ame Mea&#131;ures of Vertue and Vice as wee, and &#131;till expecting advancement to a higher and more &#131;plendid State of Lyfe. One of them is &#131;tronger than many Men, yet do not incline to hurt Mankind, except by Commi&#131;&#131;ion for a gro&#131;s Mi&#131;demeanour, as the de&#131;troying Angell of &AElig;gypt, and the A&#131;&#131;yrians, Exod. 12. 29. 2 Kings, 10. 35. They haunt mo&#131;t where is mo&#131;t Barbaritie; and therefoir our ignorant Ance&#131;tors, to prevent the In&#131;ults of that &#131;trange People, u&#131;ed as rude and cour&#131;e a Remedie; &#131;uch as Exorci&#131;ms, Donations, and Vows: But how &#131;oon ever the true Piety prevailed in any Place, it did not put the Inhabitants beyond the Reach and Awthoritie of the&#131;e &#131;ubtile inferiour Co-inhabitants and Colleagues of ours: The FATHER OF ALL SPIRITS, and the Per&#131;on</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">him&#131;elfe</P>
<P><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></P>
<P>him&#131;elfe, having the only Command of his Soul and Actions, a concurrance they may have to what is virtuously done; for upon committing of a foul Deed, one will find a Demure upon his Soul, as if his cheerfull Collegue had de&#131;erted him.</P>
<P>QUESTION 3. Do the&#131;e airie Tribes procreate? If &#131;o, how are they nouri&#131;hed, and at what period of Time do they die?</P>
<P>ANSWER. Suppo&#131;ing all Spirits to be created at once in the Beginning, Souls to pre-exist and to circle about into &#131;everal States of Probation&#131;hip; to make them either totally unexcu&#131;able, or perfectly happie again&#131;t the la&#131;t Day, &#131;olves all the Difficulties. But in very Deed, and &#131;peaking &#131;uteable to the Nature of Things, there is no more Ab&#131;urditie for a Spirit to inform ane Infant in Bodie of Airs, than a Bodie compo&#131;ed of dull and dru&#131;ie Earth; the be&#131;t of Spirits have alwayes delyghted more to appear into aereal, than into terre&#131;trial Bodyes. They feed mo&#131;t what on Quinte&#131;&#131;ences, and aetheriall E&#131;&#131;ences. The Pith and Spirits only of Women's Milk feed their Children, being arti-</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">ficially</P>
<P><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></P>
<P>ficially conveyed, (as Air and Oyl &#131;ink into our Bodies,) to make them vigorous and fre&#131;h. And this &#131;horter Way of conveying a pure Aliment, (without the u&#131;uall Dige&#131;tions,) by tran&#131;fu&#131;ing it, and tran&#131;pyring thorow the Pores into the Veins, Arteries, and Ve&#131;&#131;ells that &#131;upplie the Bodie, is nothing more ab&#131;urd, than ane Infant's being fed by the Navel before it is borne, or than a Plant, which groweth by attracting a livelie juice from the Earth thorow many &#131;mall Roots and Tendons, whose cour&#131;er Pairts be adapted and made connatural to the Whole, doth quickly coale&#131;ce by the ambient Cold; and &#131;o are conden&#131;'d and bak'd up into a confirm'd Wood in the one, and &#131;olid Bodie of the Fle&#131;h and Bone in the other. A Notion which, if intertained and approv'd, may &#131;hew that the late Invention of &#131;oaking and tran&#131;fu&#131;ing (not Blood, but) athereal virtuall Spirits, may be u&#131;efull both for Nouri&#131;hment and Health, whereof is a Ve&#131;tige in the damnable Practi&#131;e of evill Angells, their &#131;ucking of Blood and Spirits out of Witches Bodys (till they drew them into a deform'd and dry Leanne&#131;s,) to &#131;eid their own</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Vehicles</P>
<P><A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Vehicles withall, leaving what we call the Witches Mark behind; a Spot that I have &#131;een, as a &#131;mall Mole, horny, and brown-coloured; throw which Mark, when a large Bra&#131;s Pin was thru&#131;t (both in Buttock, No&#131;e, and Rooff of the Mouth,) till it bowed and become crooked, the Witches, both Men and Women, nather felt a Pain, nor did bleed, nor knew the preci&#131;e Time when this was adoing to them, (there Eyes only being covered.) Now the Air being a Body as well as Earth, no Rea&#131;on can be given why there may not be Particles of more vivific Spirit form'd of it for Procreation, then is po&#131;&#131;ible to be of Earth, which takes more Time and Pains to rarify and ripen it, ere it can come to have a prolific Virtue. And if our Aping Darlings did not thus procreate, there whole Number would be exhau&#131;ted after a con&#131;iderable Space of Time. For tho they are of more refyned Bodies and Intellectualls than wee, and of far le&#131;s heavy and corruptive Humours, (which cau&#131;e a Di&#131;&#131;olution,) yet many of their Lives being di&#131;&#131;onant to right Rea&#131;on and their own Laws,</P>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">and</P>
<P><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></P>
<P>and their Vehicles not being wholly frie of Lu&#131;t and Pa&#131;&#131;ion, e&#131;pecially of the more &#131;pirituall and hautie Sins they pa&#131;s (after a long healthy Lyfe) into one Orb and Receptacle fitted for their Degree, till they come under the general Cognizance of the la&#131;t Day.</P>
<P>QUESTION 4. Doth the acquiring of this Second Sight make any Change on the Acquirers Body, Mind, or Actions?</P>
<P>ANSWER. All uncouth SIGHTS enfeebles the SEER. Daniel, tho familiar with divyne Vi&#131;ions, yet fell frequently doun without Strength, when dazzled with a Power which had the A&#131;cendant of, and pa&#131;&#131;ed on him beyond his Comprehen&#131;ion, Chap. 10. 8. 17. So our SEER is put in a Rapture, Tran&#131;port, and &#131;ort of Death, as dive&#131;ted of his Body and all its Sen&#131;es, when he is fir&#131;t made participant of this curious Peice of Knowledge: But it maketh no Wramp or Strain in the Under&#131;tanding of any; only to the Fancy's of clownish or illiterate Men, it creates &#131;ome Affrightments and Di&#131;turbances, becau&#131;e of the Strongne&#131;s of the Showes, and their Unacquaintedne&#131;s with them. And as for their</P>
<P><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></P>
<P>their Lyfe, the Per&#131;ons endued with this Rarity are, for the mo&#131;t Part, candid, hone&#131;t, and &#131;ociable People. If any of them be &#131;ubject to Immoralities, this ob&#131;tru&#131;e Skill is not to be blamed for it; for unle&#131;s them&#131;elves be the Tempters, the Colonies of the Invi&#131;ible Plantations, with which they intercommune, do provoke them by no Villainy or Malifice, nather at their fir&#131;t Acquaintance nor after a long Familiarity.</P>
<P>QUESTION 5. Doth not Sathan interpo&#131;e in &#131;uch Ca&#131;es by many &#131;ubtile unthought In&#131;inuations, as to him who let the Fly, or Familiar, go out of the Box, and yet found the Fly of his own putting in, as &#131;erviceable as the other would have been?</P>
<P>ANSWER. The Goodne&#131;s of the Lyfe, and De&#131;igns of the ancient Prophets and Seers, was one of the be&#131;t Prooffs of their Mi&#131;&#131;ion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
