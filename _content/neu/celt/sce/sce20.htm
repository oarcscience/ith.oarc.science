<P>10. THERE be many Places called Fairie-hills, which the Mountain People think impious and dangerous to peel or di&#131;cover, by taking Earth or Wood from them; &#131;uper&#131;titiou&#131;ly beleiving the Souls of their Predice&#131;&#131;ors to dwell there.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And for that End (&#131;ay they) a Mote or Mount was dedicate be&#131;ide every Church-yard, to receive the Souls till their adjacent Bodies ari&#131;e, and &#131;o become as a Fairie-hill; they u&#131;eing Bodies of Air when called Abroad. They al&#131;o affirme tho&#131;e Creatures that move invi&#131;ibly in a Hou&#131;e, and ca&#131;t hug great Stones, but do no much Hurt, becau&#131;e counter-wrought by &#131;ome more courteous and charitable Spirits that are everywhere ready to defend Men, (Dan. 10. 13.) to be Souls that have not attained their Re&#131;t, thorough a vehement De&#131;ire of revealling a Murther or notable Injurie done or receaved,</P>

<P>or a Trea&#131;ure that was forgot in their Liftyme on Earth, which when di&#131;clo&#131;'d to a Conjurer alone, the Gho&#131;t quite removes.</P>
<P>IN the nixt Country to that of my former Re&#131;idence, about the Year 1676, when there was &#131;ome Scarcity of Graine, a marvelous Illap&#131;e and Vi&#131;ion &#131;trongly &#131;truck the Imagination of two Women in one Night, living at a good Di&#131;tance from one another, about a Trea&#131;ure hid in a Hill, called SITHBHRUAICH, or Fayrie-hill. The Appearance of a Trea&#131;ure was fir&#131;t repre&#131;ented to the Fancy, and then an audible Voyce named the Place where it was to their awaking Sen&#131;es. Whereupon both aro&#131;e, and meitting accidentallie at the Place, di&#131;covered their De&#131;igne; and joyntly digging, found a Ve&#131;&#131;ell as large as a Scotti&#131;h Peck, full of &#131;mall Pieces of good Money, of ancient Coyn; which halving betuixt them, they &#131;old in Di&#131;h-fulls for Di&#131;h-fulls of Meall to the Countrey People. Very many of undoubted Credit &#131;aw, and had of the Coyn to this Day. But whither it was a good or bad Angell, one of the &#131;ubterranean People, or the re&#131;&#131;le&#131;s Soul of him who hid it,</P>
