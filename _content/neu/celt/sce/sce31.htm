A. BARTH, in <I>M&eacute;lusine</I>.</P>
<P>"The degree and quality of the editor's learning are not to be doubted; it is varied, profound, and without a spice of pedantry."--<I>Scots Observer</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"The paramount interest of this book lies in its two disquisitions upon thc meaning of the Attis myth and upon the meaning of tree-worship."--<I>Speaker</I>.</P>
<P>"As a contribution to folk-lore it is of real value and interest, and to a considerable extent new in the line it takes."--<I>Literary World</I>.</P>
<P>"This theory, in which 'the ghost plays . . . the same part that guano and phosphates play to-day,' when stated thus baldly sounds strange, but when read in the author's own vivacious narrative, along with the excellent illustrations which he brings forward, it is singularly attractive."--<I>Bookman</I>.</P>
<P>"Highly interesting, and at this time will probably fall in with prevailing opinions."--ROBINSON ELLIS in <I>The Academy</I>.</P>
<P>"Whether readers adopt Mr. Allen's conclusions or not, all must agree that he has propounded a most interesting theory, and stated it in a manner forcible and stimulating to thought."--<I>Nation</I>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">"Mr. Jevons's essay is learned and interesting, and in some cases he has probably found out the reason of behaviour which the Romans could not account for themselves."--Daily News, Jan. 10, 1893.</P>
<P>"All antiquaries and folk-lorists will thank him for enabling them to peruse in a convenient form that part of Plutarch's 'Moralio' which bears upon their science."--<I>Daily Chronicle</I>, Jan. 6, 1893.</P>
<P>"An admirable essay on Roman religion and on the characteristics of Aryan religion."--<I>Glasgow Herald</I>, Jan. 5, 1893-</P>

<P>"Holland's translation, a delightful piece of Elizabethan English, as Mr. Jevons says, provides a seemly garb for Plutarch's ancient reasonings. Mr. Jevons's own contribution to the volume is, as a help towards a true interpretation, of scarcely less value than the translation itself."--<I>Scotsman</I>, Dec. 26, 1892.</P>
<P>"Mr. Jevons's introduction is at once learned and readable."--<I>Times</I>, Dec. 22, 1892.</P>
<P>"The editor has supplied an excellent commentary upon some of the most striking parts in a series of dissertations on Italian cults, myths, taboos, man-worship, Aryan marriage, sympathetic magic, and the eating of beans. The mere titles of these essays show the curiosity and interest of the problems dealt with in the text."--<I>Manchester Guardian</I>, Jan. 10, 1893</FONT></P>
