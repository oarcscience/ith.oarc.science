The Old Crow & The Young Crow

>  

> \[169\]

> THERE was an old crow teaching a young crow one day, and he said to
> him, "Now my son," says he, "listen to the advice I'm going to give
> you. If you see a person coming near you and stooping, mind yourself,
> and be on your keeping; he's stooping for a stone to throw at you."

> "But tell me," says the young crow, "what should I do if he had a
> stone already down in his pocket?"

> "Musha, go 'long out of that," says the old crow, "you've learned
> enough; the devil another learning I'm able to give you."
