<BLOCKQUOTE>A great great house it is,<BR>
A golden candlestick it is,<BR>
Guess it rightly,<BR>
Let it not go by thee.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>
<DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Heaven.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There's a garden that I ken,<BR>
Full of little gentlemen,<BR>
Little caps of blue they wear,<BR>
And green ribbons very fair.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Flax.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
I went up the boreen, I went down the boreen,<BR>
I brought the boreen with myself on my back.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A Ladder.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>He comes to ye amidst the brine<BR>
The butterfly of the sun,<BR>
The man of the coat so blue and fine;<BR>
With red thread his shirt is done.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Lobster.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I threw it up as white as snow,<BR>
Like gold on a flag it fell below.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Egg.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I ran and I got,<BR>
I sat and I searched,<BR>
If could get it I would not bring it with me,<BR>
And as I got it not I brought it.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Thorn in the foot.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>You see it come in on the shoulders of men,<BR>
Like a thread of the silk it will leave us again.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Smoke.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[171]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He comes through the <I>lis* </I>to me over the sward,<BR>
The man of the foot that is narrow and hard,<BR>
I would he were running the opposite way,<BR>
For o'er all that are living 'tis he who bears sway.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Death.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In the garden's a castle with hundreds within,<BR>
Yet though stripped to my shirt I would never fit in.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Ant-hill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>From house to house he goes,<BR>
A messenger small and slight,<BR>
And whether it rains or snows,<BR>
He sleeps outside in the night.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Boreen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Two feet on the ground,<BR>
And three feet overhead,<BR>
And the head of the living<BR>
In the mouth of the dead.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Girl with (three-legged) pot on her head.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>On the top of the tree<BR>
See the little man red,<BR>
A stone in his belly,<BR>
A cap on his head.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Haw.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There's a poor man at rest,<BR>
With a stick beneath his breast,<BR>
And he breaking his heart a-crying.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Lintel on a wet day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>[172]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As white as flour and it is not flour,<BR>
As green as grass and it is not grass,<BR>
As red as blood and it is not blood,<BR>
As black as ink and it is not ink.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Blackberry, from bud to fruit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A bottomless barrel,<BR>
It's shaped like a hive,<BR>
It is filled full of flesh,<BR>
And the flesh is alive.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Tailor's thimble.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>* Rath or fort or circular moat.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIR>
