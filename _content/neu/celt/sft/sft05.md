Chapter IV

Fairy Births and Human Midwives (continued)

>  

> The magical ointment--Human prying punished by fairies, and by other
> supernatural beings--Dame Berchta--Hertha--Lady Godiva--Analogous
> stories in Europe--In the East--Religious ceremonies performed by
> women only--Lady Godiva a pagan goddess.

> BEFORE we quit the subject of fairy births, we have a few more stories
> to discuss. They resemble in their general tenor those already
> noticed; but instead of one or other of the incidents considered in
> the previous chapter we are led to a different catastrophe by the
> introduction of a new incident--that of the Magical Ointment. The plot
> no longer hinges upon fairy gratitude, but upon human curiosity and
> disobedience.

> The typical tale is told, and exceedingly well told--though, alas, not
> exactly in the language of the natives--by Mrs. Bray in her Letters to
> Southey, of a certain midwife of Tavistock. One midnight, as she was
> getting into bed, this good woman was summoned by a strange,
> squint-eyed, little, ugly old fellow to follow him straight-way, and
> attend upon his wife. In spite of her instinctive repulsion she could
> not resist the command and in a moment the little man whisked her,
> with himself, upon a large coal-black horse with eyes of fire, which
> stood waiting at the door. Ere long she found herself at the door of a
> neat cottage; the patient was a decent-looking woman who already had
> two children, and all things were prepared for her visit. When the

> Child--a fine, bouncing babe--was born, its mother gave the midwife
> some ointment, with directions to "strike the child's eyes with it."
> Now the word strike in the Devonshire dialect means not to give a
> blow, but to rub, or touch, gently; and as the woman obeyed she
> thought the task an odd one, and in her curiosity tried the effect of
> the ointment upon one of her own eyes. At once a change was wrought in
> the appearance of everything around her. The new mother appeared no
> longer as a homely cottager, but a beautiful lady attired in white;
> the babe, fairer than before, but still witnessing with the elvish
> cast of its eye to its paternity, was wrapped in swaddling clothes of
> silvery gauze; while the elder children, who sat on either side of the
> bed, were transformed into flat-nosed imps, who with mops and mows
> were busied to no end in scratching their own polls, or in pulling the
> fairy lady's ears with their long and hairy paws. The nurse,
> discreetly silent about what she had done and the wonderful
> metamorphoses she beheld around her, got away from the house of
> enchantment as quickly as she could; and the sour-looking old fellow
> who had brought her carried her back on his steed much faster than
> they had come. But the next market-day, when she sallied forth to sell
> her eggs, whom should she see but the same ill-looking scoundrel
> busied in pilfering sundry articles from stall to stall. So she went
> up to him, and with a nonchalant air addressed him, inquiring after
> his wife and child, who, she hoped, were both as well as could be
> expected. "What!" exclaimed the old pixy thief, "do you see me
> to-day?" "See you! to be sure I do, as plain as I see the sun in the
> skies; and I see you are busy into the bargain," she replied. "Do you
> so? "cried he; "pray, with which eye do you see all this?" "With the
> right eye, to be sure." "The ointment! the ointment!" exclaimed the
> old fellow; "take that for meddling with what did not belong to you:
> you shall see me no more."

> He struck her eye as he spoke, and from that hour till the day of her
> death she was blind on the right side, thus dearly paying for having
> gratified an idle curiosity in the house of a pixy. \[a\]

> In this tale the midwife acquired her supernatural vision through
> gratifying her curiosity; but perhaps in the larger number of
> instances it is acquired by accident. Her eye smarts or itches; and
> without thinking, she rubs it with a finger covered with the Magical
> Ointment. In a Breton variant, however, a certain stone, perfectly
> polished, and in the form of an egg, is given to the women to rub the
> fairy child's eyes. in order to test its virtue she applies it to her
> own right eye, thus obtaining the faculty of seeing the elves when
> they rendered themselves invisible to ordinary sight. Sometimes,
> moreover, the eye-salve is expressly given for the purpose of being
> used by the nurse upon her own eyes. This was the case with a doctor
> who, in a north country tale, was presented with one kind of ointment
> before he entered the fairy realm and another when he left it. The
> former gave him to behold a splendid portico in the side of a steep
> hill, through which he passed into the fairies' hall within; but on
> anointing one eye with the latter ointment, to that eye the hill
> seemed restored to its natural shape. Similarly in Nithsdale a fairy
> rewards the kindness of a young mother, to whom she had committed her
> babe to suckle, by taking her on a visit to Fairyland. A door opened
> in a green hillside, disclosing a porch which the nurse and her
> conductor entered. There the lady dropped three drops of a precious
> dew on the nurse's left eyelid, and they were admitted to a beautiful
> land watered with meandering rivulets and yellow with corn, where the
> trees were laden with fruits which dropped honey. The nurse was here
> presented with magical gifts, and when a green dew had baptized her
> right eye she was enabled to behold further wonders. On returning, the
> fairy passed her hand over the woman's eye and restored its normal
> powers; but the woman had sufficient address to secure the
> wonder-working balm. By its means she retained for many years the gift
> of discerning the earth-visiting spirits but on one occasion,
> happening to meet the fairy lady who had given her the child, she
> attempted to shake hands with her. "What ee d' ye see me wi'?"
> whispered she. "Wi' them baith," answered the matron. The fairy
> accordingly breathed on her eyes; and even the power of the box failed
> afterwards to restore their enchanted vision. A Carnarvonshire story,
> probably incomplete, makes no mention of the ointment conferring
> supernatural sight; but when the midwife is to be dismissed she is
> told to rub her eyes with a certain salve, whereupon she at once finds
> herself sitting on a tuft of rushes, and not in a palace: baby and all
> had disappeared. The sequel, however, shows that by some means she had
> retained the power of seeing fairies, at least with one eye; for when
> she next went to the town, lo and behold! busily buying was the elf
> whose wife she had attended. He betrayed the usual annoyance at being
> noticed by the woman; and on learning with which eye she saw him he
> vanished, never more to be looked upon by her. A tale from Guernsey
> attributes the magical faculty to some of the child's saliva which
> fell into the nurse's eye. And a still more extraordinary cause is
> assigned to it in a tradition from Lower Brittany, where it is said to
> be due to the sacred bond formed between the woman and a masculine elf
> when she became godmother and he godfather to the babe. \[b\]

> The effect of the wonder-working salve or water is differently
> described in different tales. The fairy maiden Rockflower speaks of it
> to her lover, in a Breton tale from Saint Cast, as "clearing his eyes
> like her own." And this is evidently to be understood in all cases.
> Accordingly, we find the invariable result is that the favoured mortal
> beholds swarms of fairies who were invisible before. But their
> dwellings, their clothing, and their surroundings in general suffer a
> transformation by no means always the same. A hovel or a cavern
> becomes a palace, whose inhabitants, however ugly they may be, are
> attired like princesses and courtiers, and are served with vessels of
> silver and gold. On the other hand a castle is changed by the magical
> balm into "a big rough cave, with water oozing over the edges of the
> stones, and through the clay; and the lady, and the lord, and the
> child, weazened, poverty-bitten crathurs--nothing but skin and bone,
> and the rich dresses were old rags." This is an Irish picture; but in
> the north of England it is much the same. Instead of a neat cottage
> the midwife perceives the large overhanging branches of an ancient
> oak, whose hollow and moss-grown trunk she had before mistaken for the
> fireplace, where glow-worms supplied the place of lamps. And in North
> Wales, when Mrs. Gamp incautiously rubbed an itching eye with the
> finger she had used to rub the baby's eyes, "then she saw with that
> eye that the wife lay on a bundle of rushes and withered ferns, in a
> large cave of big stones all round her, with a little fire in one
> corner of it; and she also saw that the lady was only Eilian, her
> former servant-girl, whilst with the other eye she beheld the finest
> place she had ever seen." More terrible still, in another story,
> evidently influenced by the Welsh Methodist revival, the unhappy woman
> beheld "herself surrounded by fearful flames; the ladies and gentlemen
> looked like devils, and the children appeared like the most hideous
> imps of hell, though with the other parts of her eyes all looked
> "grand and beautiful as before." \[c\]

> However disturbing these visions may have been, the nurse was
> generally discreet enough to maintain perfect silence upon them until
> she got back to the safety of her own home. But it is not very
> surprising if her tongue sometimes got the better of her, as in a
> story obtained by Professor Rhys at Ystrad Meurig. There the heroine
> said to the elf-lady in the evening, as she was dressing the infant:
> "You have had a great many visitors today." To this the lady sharply
> replied: "How do you know that? Have you been putting the ointment to
> your eyes?" Thereupon she jumped out of bed, and blew into her eyes,
> saying: "Now you will see no more." The woman could never afterwards
> see the fairies, nor was the ointment entrusted to her again. So in
> the Cornish tale of Cherry of Zennor, that young damsel, being hired
> by a fairy widower to keep house for him, has the assurance to fail in
> love with him. She touches her own eyes with the unguent kept for
> anointing the eyes of her master's little boy, and in consequence
> catches her master kissing a lovely lady. When he next attempts to
> kiss Cherry herself she slaps his face, and, mad with jealousy, lets
> slip the secret. No fairy widower with any self-respect could put up
> with such conduct as this; and Cherry has to quit Fairyland. Her
> parents had supposed her dead; and when she returned they believed at
> first it was her ghost. Indeed, it is said she was never afterwards
> right in her head; and on moonlight nights, until she died, she would
> wander on to the Lady Downs to look for her master. \[d\]

> The earliest writer who mentions a story of this type is Gervase of
> Tilbury, marshal of the kingdom of Arles, who wrote about the
> beginning of the thirteenth century. He professes to have himself met
> with a woman of Aries who was one day washing clothes on the banks of
> the Rhone, when a wooden bowl floated by her. In trying to catch it,
> she got out of her depth and was seized by a Drac. The Dracs were
> beings who haunted the waters of rivers and dwelt in the deep pools,
> appearing often on the banks and in the towns in human form. The woman
> in question was carried down beneath the stream, and, like Cherry of
> Zennor, made nurse to her captor's son. One day the Drac gave her an
> eel pasty to eat. Her fingers became greasy with the fat; and she
> happened to put them to one of her eyes. Forthwith she acquired a
> clear and distinct vision under the water. After some years she was
> allowed to return to her husband and family; and going early one
> morning to the market-place of Beaucaire, she met the Drac.
> Recognizing him at once, she saluted him and asked after the health of
> his wife and child. "With which eye do you see me?" inquired the Drac.
> The woman pointed to the eye she had touched with the eel-fat; and
> thrusting his finger into it, the Drac vanished from sight. \[e\]

> The only punishment suffered in these cases is the deprivation of the
> power of seeing fairies, or banishment from their society. This seems
> mild enough: much more was generally inflicted. The story first quoted
> relates what seems to be the ordinary form of vengeance for disregard
> of the prohibition to use the fairy eye-salve, namely, loss of sight
> in the offending eye. Spitting or striking is usually the means
> adopted by the elves to effect this end. Sometimes, however, the eye
> is torn from its socket. Whether there is much to choose between these
> different ways of undergoing the punishment is doubtful; but it should
> be noted that the last-mentioned mode is a favourite one in Brittany,
> and followsnot so much on recognition as on denunciation by the
> virtuous mortal of the elf's thieving propensities. "See what thieves
> these fairies are!" cried a woman who watched one of them putting her
> hand into the pocket of a country woman's apron. The fairy instantly
> turned round and tore out her eye. "Thieves! "bawled another on a
> similar occasion, with the same result. In a Cornish tale a woman is
> entrusted in her own house with the care of an elf-child. The child
> brought remarkable prosperity to the house, and his foster-mother grew
> very fond of him. Finding that a certain water in which she was
> required to wash his face made it very bright, she determined to try
> it on her own, and splashed some of it into her eye. This conferred
> the gift of seeing the little people, who played with her boy, but had
> hitherto been invisible to her; and one day she was surprised to meet
> her nursling's father in the market--stealing. Recognition followed,
> and the stranger exclaimed:

> " Water for elf, not water for self,  
> You've lost your eye, your child, and yourself."

> From that hour she was blind in the right eye. When she got home the
> boy was, gone; and she and her husband, who had once been so happy,
> became poor and wretched. \[f\]

> Here poverty and wretchedness, as well as the loss of an eye, were
> inflicted. In a Northumbrian case the foster-parent lost his charge
> and both eyes. So in a story from Guernsey, the midwife, On the
> Saturday following her attendance on the lady, meets the husband and
> father in a shop filling his basket to right and left. She at once
> comprehends the plenty that reigned in his mysterious dwelling. "Ah,
> you wicked thief, I see you!" she cried. "You see me; how?" he
> inquired. "With my eyes," she replied. "In that case I will soon put
> you out of power to play the spy," he answered. So saying, he spat in
> her face, and she became blind on the spot. A Danish story also
> relates that a midwife, who had inadvertently anointed her eyes with
> the salve handed to her by the elf-folk for the usual purpose, was
> going home afterwards and passed by a rye-field. The field was
> swarming with elves, who were busy clipping off the ears of rye.
> Indignantly she cried out: " What are you doing there?" The little
> people thronged round her, and angrily answered: " If thou canst see
> us, thus shalt thou be served;" and suiting the action to the word,
> they put out her eyes. \[g\]

> Human beings, however, betray their meddling with fairy ointment in
> other ways than by speech. The following curious story was related as
> current at his native place, by Dr. Carré of St. Jacut-de-la-Mer, to
> M. Sébillot. A fisherman from St. Jacut was the last to return one
> evening at dusk from the scene of his labours; and as he walked along
> the wet sand of the seashore, he suddenly came upon a number of
> sea-fairies in a cavern, talking and gesticulating with vivacity,
> though he could not hear what they said. He beheld them rub their eyes
> and bodies with a sort of pomade, when, lo! their appearance changed,
> and they, were enabled to walk away in the guise of ordinary women.
> Hiding carefully behind a large rock, he watched them out of sight;
> and then, impelled by curiosity, he made straight for the cave. There
> he found what was left of the pomade, and taking a little on his
> finger, he smeared it around his left eye. By this means he found
> himself able to penetrate the various disguises assumed by the fairies
> for the purpose of robbing or annoying mankind. He recognized as one
> of that mischievous race a beggar-woman whom he saw a few days
> afterwards going from door to door demanding charity. He saw her
> casting spells on certain houses, and peering eagerly into all, as if
> she were seeking for something to steal. He distinguished, too, when
> out in his boat, fish which were real fish from fish which were in
> reality "ladies of the sea," employed in entangling the nets and
> playing other tricks upon the seamen.' Attending the fair of
> Ploubalay, he saw several elves who had assumed the shapes of
> fortune-tellers, showmen, or gamblers, to deceive the country folk;
> and this permitted him to keep clear of their temptations. But as he
> smiled to himself at what was going on around him, some of the elves,
> who were exhibiting themselves on a platform in front of one of the
> booths, caught sight of him; and he saw by the anger in their looks
> that they had divined his secret. Before he had time to fly, one of
> them, with the rapidity of an arrow, struck his clairvoyant eye with a
> stick and burst it. That is what happened to him who would learn the
> secrets of the sea-fairies. \[h\]

> Such was the punishment of curiosity; nor is it by fairies alone that
> curiosity is punished. Cranmere Pool on Dartmoor is, we are told, a
> great penal settlement for refractory spirits. Many of the former
> inhabitants of the parish are supposed to be still there expiating
> their ghostly pranks. Of the spirit of one old farmer it is related
> that it took seven clergymen to secure him. They, however, succeeded
> at last in transforming him into a colt, which was given in charge to
> a servant-boy with directions to take him to Cranmere Pool, and there
> on the brink of the pool to slip off the halter and return instantly
> without looking round. He did look round, in spite of the warning,,
> and beheld the colt in the form of a ball of fire plunge into the
> water. But as the mysterious beast plunged he gave the lad a parting
> kick, which knocked out one of his eyes, just as the Calender was
> deprived of his eye in the "Arabian Nights." Still worse was the fate
> that overtook a woman, who, at midnight on New Year's Eve, when all
> water is turned into wine, was foolhardy enough to go to a well. As
> she bent over it to draw, one came and plucked out her eye, saying:

> "All water is wine,  
> And thy two eyes are mine."

> A variant of the story relates that the woman herself disappeared, and
> gives the rhyme as

> All water is wine,  
> And what is thereby is mine." \[i\]

> At the end of the last chapter we noted as a characteristic of fairy
> nature the objection to be recognized and addressed by men who are
> privileged to see them. We are now able to carry the generalization a
> step further. For, from 'the instances adduced in the foregoing pages,
> it is obviously a common belief that supernatural personages, without
> distinction, dislike not merely being recognized and addressed, but
> even being seen, or at all events being watched, and are only willing
> to be manifested to humanity at their own pleasure and for their own
> purposes. In the stories of the Magical Ointment it is not so much the
> theft as the contravention of the implicit prohibition against prying
> into fairy business that rouses elfin anger. This will appear more
> clearly from the fuller consideration of cases like those mentioned in
> the last paragraph, in,which punishment follows directly upon the act
> of spying. In Northamptonshire, we learn that a man whose house was
> frequented by fairies, and who had received many favours from them,
> became smitten with a violent desire to behold his invisible
> benefactors. Accordingly, he one night stationed himself behind a knot
> in the door which divided the living-room of his cottage from the
> sleeping-apartment. True to their custom, the elves came to disport
> themselves on his carefully-swept hearth, and to render to the
> household their usual good offices. But no sooner had the man glanced
> upon them than he became blind; and so provoked were the fairies at
> this breach of hospitality that they deserted his dwelling, and never
> more returned to it. In Southern Germany and Switzerland, a mysterious
> lady known as Dame Berchta is reputed to be abroad on Twelfth Night.
> She is admittedly the relic of a heathen goddess, one of whose
> attributes was to be a leader of the souls of the dead; and as such
> she is followed by a band of children. For her the peasants on Twelfth
> Night set a repast, of which, if she be pleased, she and her troop
> partake. A servant boy at a peasant's farm in the Tirol on one such
> occasion perceived Lady Berchta's approach, and hid himself behind the
> kneading-trough to watch what she would do. She immediately became
> aware of his presence as he peeped through a chink, and called to one
> of her children to go and stop that chink. The child went and blew
> into it, and the boy became stark-blind. Thus he continued for a year,
> nor could any doctor help him, until an old experienced man advised
> him to go to the same place on the following Twelfth-tide, and falling
> down on his knees behind the kneading-trough, to bewail his curiosity.
> He accordingly did so. Dame Berchta came again, and taking pity on
> him, commanded one of her children to restore his sight. The child
> went and blew once more through the chink, and the boy saw. Berchta,
> however, and her weird troop he saw not; but the food set out for them
> had disappeared.' \[j\]

> The tradition of the goddess Hertha lingered until recently, and
> perchance lingers still, in the island of Rugen. She had her dwelling,
> it is believed, in the Herthaburg; and often yet, in the clear
> moonlight, out of the forest which enfolds that hill, a fair lady
> comes surrounded by her maids to bathe in the lake at its foot. After
> awhile they emerge from the waters, and, wrapt again in their long
> white veils, they vanish flickering among the trees. But to the
> belated wanderer, if any such there be, who looks upon this scene, it
> is a vision of dread; for he is drawn by irresistible might to the
> lake wherein the white lady is bathing, to be swallowed up in its
> depths. And it is said that every year the lady must lure one unhappy
> mortal into the flood. So in the classic mythology, if Ovid report
> aright, Actaeon met the fearful fate of transformation into a stag by
> "gazing on divinity disrobed," and was torn in pieces by his own
> hounds. Hertha was, indeed, according to Tacitus, more terrible than
> Diana, since death was the penalty even when duty called her slaves to
> the awful sight. \[k\]

> These traditions have led us away from the Magical Ointment,which thus
> appears to be only one aspect of the larger theme of the objection on
> the part of supernatural beings to human prying. Nor need we regret
> having strayed; for we are brought naturally to one of the most
> interesting of our national legends, namely, that of Lady Godiva; and
> it will well repay a little consideration. As generally told today it
> bears an unmistakable resemblance to the foregoing stories; but there
> seems some difficulty in classing it with them, because Peeping Tom is
> wanting in the most ancient version known to us.

> Godiva, properly Godgifu, was an undoubted historical personage, the
> wife of Leofric, Earl of the Mercians, and mother of the Earls Morcar
> and Edwin, and of Edith, wife first of Gruffydd, Prince of North
> Wales, and afterwards of King Harold the Second. The earliest mention
> of her famous ride through Coventry is by Roger of Wendover, who wrote
> in the beginning of the thirteenth century, or a hundred and fifty
> years or thereabout after her death. His account of the matter is as
> follows:

> "The countess Godiva, who was a great lover of God's mother, longing
> to free the town of Coventry from the oppression of a heavy toll,
> often with urgent prayers besought, her husband, that from regard to
> Jesus Christ and His mother, he would free the town from that service,
> and from all other heavy burdens; and when the earl sharply rebuked
> her for foolishly asking what was so much to his damage, and always
> forbade her evermore to speak to him on the subject; and while she, on
> the other hand, with a woman's pertinacity, never ceased to exasperate
> her husband on that matter, he at last made her this answer: 'Mount
> your horse, and ride naked before all the people, through the market
> of the town from one end to the other, and on your return you shall
> have your request.' On which Godiva replied: 'But will you give me
> permission if I am willing to do it?' 'I will,' said he. Whereupon the
> countess, beloved of God, loosed her hair and let down her tresses,
> which covered the whole of her body like a veil, and then mounting her
> horse and attended by two knights, she rode through the market place
> without being seen, except her fair legs; and having completed the
> journey, she returned with gladness to her astonished husband, and
> obtained, of him what she had asked, for Earl Leofric freed the town
> of Coventry and its inhabitants from the aforesaid service, and
> confirmed what he had done by a charter." \[l\] According to the more
> modern version, the inhabitants were enjoined to remain within doors,
> and, in the Laureate's words:

> "one low churl, compact of thankless earth,  
> The fatal byword of all years to come,  
> Boring a little auger-hole in fear,  
> Peep'd--but his eyes, before they had their will,  
> Were shrivell'd into darkness in his head,  
> And dropt before him. So the powers who wait  
> On noble deeds, cancell'd a sense misus'd."

> It is not my business now to prove that the legend is untrue in fact,
> or I should insist, first, that its omission by previous writers, who
> refer both to Leofric and Godgifu and their various good deeds, is
> strong negative testimony against it; and I should show, from a
> calculation made by the late Mr. M. H. Bloxam, and founded on the
> record of Domesday Book, that the population of Coventry in Leofric's
> time could scarcely have exceeded three hundred and fifty souls, all
> in a greater or less degree of servitude, and dwelling probably in
> wooden hovels each of a single story, with a door, but no window.\[m\]
> There was, therefore, no market on the scale contemplated by Roger of
> Wendover,--hardly, indeed, a town through which Godgifu could have
> ridden; and a mere toll would have been a matter of small moment when
> the people were all serfs. The tale, in short, in the form given by
> the chronicler, cotild not have been told until after Coventry had
> risen to wealth and importance by means of its monastery, whereof
> Godgifu and her husband were the founders. Nobody, however, now
> asserts that Roger of Wendover's narrative is to be taken seriously.
> What therefore I want to point out in it is that Godgifu's bargain was
> that she should ride naked *before all the people*. And this is what
> the historian understands her to have done; for he states that she
> rode through the market-place without being seen, *except her fair
> legs*, all the rest of her body being covered by her hair like a veil.
> He tells us nothing about a proclamation to the inhabitants to keep
> within doors; and of course Peeping Tom is an impossibility in this
> version of the tale.

> Coventry has for generations honoured its benefactress by a periodical
> procession, wherein she is represented by a girl dressed as nearly
> like the countess on her ride as the manners of the day have
> permitted. When this procession was first instituted, is unknown. The
> earliest mention of it seems to be in the year 1678. Its object then
> was to proclaim the Great Fair, and Lady Godiva was merely an incident
> in it. The Lansdowne MSS. in the British Museum contain an account of
> a visit to Coventry by the "captain, lieutenant, and ancient" of the
> military company of Norwich, who travelled in the Midland Counties in
> August 1634. These tourists describe St. Mary's Hall as adorned at the
> upper end "with rich hangings, and all about with fayre pictures, one
> more especially of a noble lady (the Lady Godiva) whose memory they
> have cause not to forget, for that shee purchas'd and redeem'd their
> lost infringed liberties and ffreedomes, and obtained remission of
> heavy tributes impos'd upon them, by undertaking a hard and unseemly
> task, w'ch was to ride naked openly at high noone day through the city
> on a milk-white steed, w'ch she willingly performed, according to her
> lord's strict injunction. It may be very well discussed heere whether
> his hatred or her love exceeded. Her fayre long hayre did much offend
> the wanton's glancing eye." In this record we have no additional fact
> except the mention of "high noone day" as the time of the journey; for
> the allusion to "the wanton's glancing eye" is too vague to be
> interpreted of Peeping Tom, and the writer does not refer to any
> commemorative procession. It has been supposed, therefore, that the
> carnival times of Charles the Second both begot the procession and
> tacked Peeping Tom to the legend. But it is more likely that the
> procession is as old as the fair, which was held under a charter of
> Henry the Third, granted in 1217. Such pageants were not uncommon in
> municipal life, and were everywhere to the taste of the people
> Whether. Lady Godiva was a primitive part. of it is another question.
> The mention of the procession in 1678 occurs in a manuscript volume of
> annals of the city, in a handwriting of the period. The entry in
> question is as follows "31 May 1678 being the great Fair at Coventry
> there was an extraordinary " ere the bottom of the page is reached;
> and in turning over the chronicler has omitted a word, for on the top
> of the next page we read:\] "Divers of the Companies" \[i.e., the City
> Guilds\] "set out each a follower, The Mayor Two, and the Sheriffs
> each one and 2 at the publick charge, there were divers Streamers with
> the Companies arms and Ja. Swinnertons Son represented Lady Godiva."
> \[n\]

> This brief entry is by no means free from ambiguity. Perhaps all that
> we are warranted in inferring from it is that the annual procession
> was, that year, of unusual splendour. Whether, as has been
> conjectured, it was the first time Lady Godiva had ever made her
