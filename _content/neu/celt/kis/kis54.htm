<P>Without hap or mishap we came at last to the domain of the King of Senlabor. Baun went to sing for the King's foster-daughters, and Deelish went to work at the little loom in the King's chamber. We were not long at the court of the King of Senlabor when two youths came there from the court of the King of Ireland--Dermott and Downal were their names. There was a famous sword-smith with the King of Senlabor and these two came to learn the trade from him.

"It may be," he said, "that these two youths will bring what my Queen longs for--a berry from the Fairy Rowan Tree that is guarded by the Giant Crom Duv."</P>
