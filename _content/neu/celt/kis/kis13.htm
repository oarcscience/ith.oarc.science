<P>The Cloud-woman, Mor, was the daughter <BR>
Of Griann, the Sun,--well, and she<BR>
Made a marriage to equal that grandeur,<BR>
For her Goodman was Lir, the Sea.</P>
<P>The Cloud-woman Mor, she had seven<BR>
Strong sons, and the story-books say<BR>
Their inches grew in the night-time,<BR>
And grew over again in the day.</P>
<P>The Cloud-woman Mor,--as they grew in<BR>
Their bone, she grew in her pride,<BR>
Till her haughtiness turned away, men say,<BR>
Her goodman Lir from her side;</P>
<P>Then she lived in Mor's Home and she watched<BR>
With pride her sons and her crop,<BR>
Till one day the wish in her grew<BR>
To view from the mountain-top<BR>
All, all that she owned, so she<BR>
Traveled without any stop.</P>
<P>And what did she see? A thousand<BR>
Fields and her own fields small, small!<BR>
"What a fine and wide place is Eirinn," said she,<BR>
"I am Mor, but not great after all."</P>
<P>Then a herdsman came, and he told her<BR>
That her sons had stolen away:<BR>
They had left the calves in the hollow,<BR>
With the goose-flock they would not stay:</P>
<P>They had seen three ships on the sea<BR>
And nothing would do them but go:<BR>
Mor wept and wept when she heard it,<BR>
And her tears made runnels below.</P>
<P>Then her shining splendor departed:<BR>
She went, and she left no trace,<BR>
And the Cloud-woman, Mor, was never<BR>
Beheld again in that place.</P>
<P>The proud woman, Mor, who was daughter<BR>
Of Griann, the Sun, and who made<BR>
A marriage to equal that grandeur,<BR>
Passed away as a shade.</P></DIR>
