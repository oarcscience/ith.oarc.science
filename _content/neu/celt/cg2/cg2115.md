### N

*Naoi*, *naodh*, nine. The number nine often occurs in these and other
Gaelic compositions,--three, seven, nine, and occasionally five, being
the mystic numbers. The following are some examples of the use of
nine:--

In North Uist there is a sandy plain called 'Sail Dharaich,' Oak-log. A
beam of oak lay there, from which the people produced the 'tein-eigin,'
neid-fire. This was done by 'naoi naoinear ciad ginealach mac,' nine
nines of first-begotten sons, these being in the estimation of the
people the most sacred and enduring.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

In the Glenlonain cross, which is evidently pre-Christian, there are
nine radii from a central ring or boss.

The girdle the fairy girl gave the man was to bring his wife back from
death to life, 'ge do bhiodh na naoi bais na beul,' though the nine
deaths were in her mouth.

The sword of Connal 'could cut nine nines hither and nine nines
thither.'

Luas-lurgan, the sister of Cumhal, taught Fionn the son of Cumhal to
swim so well that he could 'swim over the nine waves and be ashore
before herself.'

Oscar threatened to send the 'spear of the nine enchantments' through
Cairbre.

In a story of great dramatic power dealing with an old belief that seals
were metamorphosed human beings, the number nine occurs.

A boat from Uist was 'dorghadh,' 'dorathach,' hand-line fishing, at
Cousmal when a sudden storm arose and drove it, according to one
version, to Lewis, according to others, to Mull, Tiree, or Scandinavia.
The Uist crofters were hospitably entertained and their boat repaired.
Their host was a big grizzly-bearded man, whose face, hands, and feet
were full of scars and mended bones, as if he had fought his way through
some desperate battle. According to Celtic custom the names of the
guests were neither given nor asked till they were leaving. When the
host heard the name and residence of his leading guest, he pointed to
his scars and mended bones and addressed the man:--

'Iogan' (probably a diminutive of 'Iain'--John, possibly an old native
name), was struck with terror and remorse, for this was a big seal who,
with his wife and children and many other

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

metamorphosed seals, had been visiting the homes and graves of their
submerged fatherland in the Atlantic, when they were attacked, and some
of them slain, by the Uist men, among whom was Iogan. Iogan gave vow and
word by his own hand and his father's hands that he would never again
kill a seal.

A 'seoltaiche,' cunning man, went about lifting the 'toradh,' substance,
from the nine best glens in Scotland. Killinn was the last glen to which
he came. He lifted the substance of Killinn on his back, and was moving
away, when a man more shrewd than his fellows cut the wizard's withy
with his knife, and the luck of the whole nine glens fell to the ground.
And that is how Killinn is the most fertile glen in Scotland, flowing
with milk and honey.

The Killinn meant is that in Stratherrick, near Lochness.

Nine times nine is the number of straw joints required in the
manipulation of 'Eolas nam foineachean,' the charm of the warts, and
nine in 'Eolas nam mam,' the charm of the mumps. There are nine orders
of angels, and nine choirs of archangels, according to the Christian
hierarchy of the Fathers.

The fairies are said to possess nine ages, with nine times nine periods
of time in each. These are the periods:

*Nathair*, serpent, adder. Several terms are applied to the serpent, as
'nathair,' serpent; 'nimhir,' venom; 'beithir,' lightning; 'righinn,'
queen; and 'nighean Imhir,' daughter of Ivor, 'dearrais,' perverse.
Probably 'nighean Imhir,' daughter of Ivor is a mistake for 'an nimhir,'
the serpent, while 'nighean' may be a mistake for 'ruain,' hue, coloured
spot.

The serpent is now small and rare, though once large and numerous, in
the Highlands. One was killed at Bailemonaidh,

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

in Islay, in the early years of the century, measuring nine feet in
length and eighteen inches in circumference. Much warm milk was
abstracted every night from the milk-cot attached to the summer
sheiling. After much searching, traces of milk were found leading to a
grassy knoll in the neighbourhood. On the summit of the knoll a serpent
lay coiled sunning itself in the summer sun and fast asleep. It
immediately awoke, and, poising its head high in the air, hissed and
lunged about in great fury. When shot, its enormously distended stomach
was found to contain several twites, buntings, pipits, larks, and
thrushes, and an incredible quantity of milk.

Only a few years ago a larger serpent than this was killed in a
turnip-field in Easter Ross. The presence of the reptile was indicated
by the fear and anxiety displayed by a pair of well-trained horses
working in the neighbourhood. Nothing could be seen, but the horses
trembled violently, and, with nostrils distended and eyes staring,
showed symptoms of great fear and could hardly be kept from running away
from the men about them. When after some delay and difficulty the
serpent was found and killed the horses quieted down, but for some days
showed the effects of their fear.

A product called 'clach-nathrach,' serpent stone, is found on the root
of the long ling. It is of steel-grey colour, has the consistency of
soft putty when new and of hard putty when old, and is as light as
pumice-stone, which it resembles. It is of a globular form, and from one
to three inches in diameter. There is a circular hole, about a quarter
of an inch in width, through the centre. This substance is said to be
produced by the serpent emitting spume round the root of a twig of
heather. The 'clach-nathrach' is greatly prized by the people, who
transmit it as a talisman to their descendants.

There are many sayings dealing with the serpent:--

<div align="center">

|                                             |     |                                                    |
|---------------------------------------------|-----|----------------------------------------------------|
| 'Tha e ann an grath na nathrach dhuit.'     |     | He is in the spirit of the serpent towards thee.   |
| 'Tha nimh na nathrach aig dhuit.'           |     | The venom of the serpent he has towards thee.      |
| 'Cho carach ris an nathair nimhe.'          |     | As twistful as the serpent venomous.               |
| 'Cleas na nathrach cur a chraicinn.'        |     | The trick of the serpent changing the skin.        |
| 'Cochull nathrach is ole a dh’fheumadh tu.' |     | The sheath of the serpent badly wouldst thou need. |

</div>

 

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

'*Nead ri beul an uisge*,' a nest by the mouth of the water (vol. i. p.
314). The nest of the black-throated diver is that indicated. The
black-throated diver is known among the people as 'learg,' diver; 'learg
mhor,' big diver; 'learg dhubh,' black diver; 'learg choilearach,'
ringed diver; 'learg choilearach dhubh,' black-ringed diver; 'giadh
gaob,' rain goose. The last name is in reference to the belief that
certain peculiarities in the cry and flight of the bird indicate rain.
The bird is familiar in the West of Scotland, although rare or unknown
in other parts of Britain.

During development the black-throated diver and the great northern diver
are similar, although in maturity dissimilar. In course of incubation
nature provides birds with great heat, rendering them liable to great
thirst. To obviate absence from the eggs and retardation of hatching,
the black-throated diver makes her nest near water, generally on the
bank of a lake, occasionally on the edge of a stream. The nest is simply
a depression in the moss within reach of the water. Should drought
occur, and the water subside below her reach, the bird flies about
hither and thither uttering cries of concern. The people have rendered
these utterances of the bird into human language:--

These imitations differ more or less in different districts. The
preceding imitation prevails in North and South Uist, the following in
Harris and Lewis:--

When the reverse occurs, and the risen lake submerges the nest, the
cries of the hapless bird, flying hither and thither, are extremely
distressing, and strikingly like the unavailing cries of

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

a human mother. The people have rendered these cries into the following
words:--

*Neamh*, heaven. Old people pronounce this word 'neamh,' 'neomh,'
'neoph,' 'neob,' 'nof,' 'nef,' and other forms.

 

*Ni*, neat, nowt, cattle, extended to flocks and herds of all kinds.

 

*Nō*, *nōd*, *nōdh*, *nōdadh*, knowledge, intelligence, information; 'Ni
bheil nōdh agam air,' I have no knowledge of him.
