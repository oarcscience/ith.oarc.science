### E

*Eala*, *eal*, *ai*, swan. 'Eala bhan,' fair swan; 'eala-gheal,' white
swan; 'eala ghlas,' grey swan; 'eala-dhonn,' brown swan, cygnet.

There is no bird of passage so welcome in the Western Isles as the swan.
Its size, its beauty, its mysterious, plaintive melody, give it a
semi-sacred character in the eyes of the people. It is interesting to
see swans feeding, and varieties of small ducks, chiefly teal, jerking
in and out among them, busily picking up the animalcula and fragments
brought up by the swans. The swans take no notice of the ducks, but
treat them with dignified indifference, even when the ducks pass under
their bills and necks.

In severe winters swans come in large flocks to the Western Isles. When
the freezing of the water seems imminent the swans will flap the water
with their wings to keep an open space, taking the work in turn. When
they are frozen out of the lake they betake themselves to the estuaries
of the sea. Swans, like geese, fly in wedge-shaped flocks, often at a
high altitude. But even when the flock is only an indistinct haze their
striking melody fills the air. To see several hundreds of these
beautiful birds together, as they sail rather than fly overhead, is a
sight one would not willingly forget, while their liquid voice is like
the music of the long-ago echoing through the cloistered cells of
memory.

But the swan sings its most beautiful melody as its own death dirge. The
following imitations of the swan's song were taken down from old people
in Uist who lived beside lakes on which swans remained for half the
year, and to whom swans and their ways were familiar:--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Probably the
mention of Ireland is in reference to the story of 'The Children of
Lir,' one of the three great 'Sorrows of Story-telling.'

Although the singing of the swan is not generally acknowledged by
ornithologists, it is a widespread and an old belief. Several of the
Latin poets speak of it, and mention of it is also to be found in German
and Russian authors. *Cf*. Müllenhoff's *Altertumskunde*, where an
interesting account is given of the song of the swan.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The swan was vowed
upon in England also:--'Edward vowed on the swan.'--Green's *History*.

The word 'eala,' is also applied to a pillared stone, a sanctuary, but
probably in this case it is old Gaelic 'elad,' 'ealadh,' a tomb. There
are stones so called in Lismore, Iona, Crinan, Fortrose, and elsewhere.
That in Lismore is near the church, formerly the choir of the cathedral.
A criminal who reached the 'eala' was safe for a year and a day, or
until he paid the ransom. If the ransom was not paid by the expiry of
that time, the criminal was tried at 'Druim na Bithe,' ridge of
judgment, a few hundred yards west of the 'eala.' After the trial the
accused was led back to the stone. If acquitted he was led sunwise round
the sanctuary and liberated. If condemned, he was led three times
withershins round the stone and then taken to 'Druim na croiche,'

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

ridge of the gallows, a few hundred yards to the south. In Iona, at
'Port nam marbh,' port of the dead, where the dead were landed for
burial in the holy isle, there is a raised platform called 'eala.' The
platform is in the form of an altar, and the dead were carried three
times sunwise round it and placed upon it before burial. All the stones
known to me called 'eala' were places of sanctuary. The poetess
Mairearad NicLachuinn has 'dhol air tir air an Ealaidh,' to land at the
'eala,' in Iona.

 

*Ear*, east. The old people paid much attention to the orientation of
their dwellings and temples.

*Eararadh*, seeking, searching. 'Air eiriridh,' on the search; 'eiriridh
maidne,' morning search; 'eiriridh chloimh,' wool-seeking; 'eiriridh
dhaoine,' seeking people.

 

*Eararach*, *eiririch*, parched grain. When corn, especially bere or
barley, is dried it is beaten to take off the awn. This used to be done
with the naked feet, generally by women, so as not to bruise or break
the grain. Hence the reference in the dance song:--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In Shetland the
parched grain and the meal from it are called 'burstin,' probably from
the tendency of the grain to burst in the process of drying.

 

*Earasaid*, a wide mantle that used to be worn by women in the
Highlands. Occasionally it was made of tartan, but generally of
'iomairt.' The 'earasaid' is mentioned in a song sung by Boswell at
Rararsay. The subject of the song is Prince Charlie, over whom
Highlanders lost their heads and their hearts.

*Earc*, a heifer, cow, beast of the cow kind; 'earc iuc,' notched cow,
from 'earc,' a cow, and 'iuc,' a notch, possibly applied to the
Caledonian cattle.

 

*Earnach*, *arnach*, red-water in cattle, red pleura, bloody flux.

 

*Earrlait*, rich soil, ground manured one year and productive the next,
productive animals, prosperous undertaking.

 

*Eidhion*, *iadhain*, *eidh-shlat*, *iadh-shlat*, and *eidhion mu
chrann*, ivy. 'Iadh-shlat' is more often and more correctly applied to
the honeysuckle.

Ivy is one of the many sacred shrubs of the Celts. It is used as a
protective for milk, milk products, flocks, and by lovers as an emblem
of fidelity. An old man in Uist said that he used to swim to an islet in
a lake in his neighbourhood for ivy, woodbine, and mountain ash. These,
sometimes separately and sometimes combined, he twined into a
three-plied 'cuach,' ring, which he placed over the lintel of his
cow-house and under the vessels in his milk-house, to safeguard his cows
and his milk from witchcraft, evil eye, and murrain.

The term 'iadh-shlat' is used by old people, and occurs in old poetry.

This fragment was taken down in 1860 from Kenneth Morrison, Trithion,
Minginis, Skye. Kenneth Morrison was then blind and old, but he
remembered many beautiful and rare old poems with more or less
completeness. These he heard when a boy at the 'ceilidh,' of which he
gave many graphic descriptions.

 

*Eigir*, *Aegir*, a god, a deity, a king. In Norse mythology Aigir is
king of the sea, god of the ocean. In Celtic mythology he is king of the
dwarfs, god of the misers.

In Arran, 'iasg eigir' is a small fish, a dwarf fish, and 'iasgach
eigir' is a poor fishing, whether for the night or for the season. In
Barra, 'ubh eigir' is a small egg, a dwarf egg, while 'uibhean eigir,'
dwarf eggs, is a term applied to the eggs of the smallest sea and land
birds.

'Eigir,' wrongly 'seigir,' is applied to the little gull, an occasional
visitor, and more commonly to the kittiwake, the smallest permanent
British gull.

'Eigire giullain' is a puny boy; 'eigire bodaich,' a miserly Carle;
'eigire truagh duine,' a mean, miserable man. 'Teom eigir' is a small
dole; 'deirc eigir,' miserable alms; 'tiodhlac eigir,' a miserly
donation. 'Tiodhlac eigir' is applied to an illiberal religious
oblation. 'D uair bha an duine ann an gabhadh bais agus ann an anradh
cruaidh thug e boid agus briathar gun toireadh e tiodhlac toighe agus
nasga deirce. Fhuair an duine as a ghabhadh bais agus as an anradh
chruaidh agus thug e tiodhlac agus deirc ach b’e sin deirc a bhroin agus
tiodhlac eigir!'--'When the man was in death straits, and in hard
plight, he

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

vowed and asseverated that he would give oblation and free alms. The man
got out of the death straits, and out of the hard plight, and he gave
oblation and alms, but that was the alms of sorrow and the puny
oblation!'

Besides 'Lioc a Eigir' in South Uist, there is 'Laimrig Eigir,'
landing-place of Aigir in North Uist, and there are in Benbecula 'Loch
Eigir,' lake of Aigir, 'Eilean Eigir,' island of Aigir, 'Sgeir Eigir,'
the reef of Aigir, and 'Iol Eigir,' the fishing-place of Aigir.

The lake is small and full of small brown trout. The island is merely a
rock on which some grass grows. It is the resort of the black-headed
gull and of the Arctic tern in their season.

An old 'clachan,' path of stepping stones, connects the rock with the
shore, and indicates that the fishing-place was known to people in olden
times.

'Leac Eigir' is mentioned in a secular poem taken down in 1870 from
Fearachar Beaton, shepherd, Corradale, South Uist. The poem is old and
of geological interest. It describes scenes and changes which have
occurred in the relative position of sea and land, and in the climatic
and economic conditions of Uist. The poet had either a prophetic eye for
the future or an observant eye for the past. The poem professes to have
been composed by a woman of whose age even tradition failed to account.
The woman was known during the centuries as 'Cailleach bheag an
f hasaich,' little carlin of the wild. The oldest 'seanachie,'
historian, in Uist remarked to the woman that she had been an old woman
when his great-great-grandfather was a boy. The woman did not take
offence at her implied great age, and she said

'When I was a "marcag mullaich," little summit-rider, Heisgeir was the
peninsula of Ei, in Benbecula, and joined to South Uist and to North
Uist. South Uist was joined to Barra, and North Uist was joined to
Harris, and this Long Island was called "Innis Cat," Island of the Cat
or Caty. I would leave my little brown bower beneath the shelter of
"Creag nam brath," in Heisgeir, when the little brown brindled lark of
Mary bounded to the ear of heaven to herald the dawn, and I would ride
my white sturdy garron and reach my green grey bothy in Corradale as the
swift russet stag rose from his lair to shake the dew-drops from his
horns.'

This and much more had been in verse, but the fragment that

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

All the places mentioned are in South Uist. Corradale is a deep green
glen between Hecla and Benmore facing the Minch. There are several
underground dwellings and rock caves of much interest in the
neighbourhood of Corradale. One of these caves is 'Uamh nan Tighearnan,'
the cave of the gentlemen, where the gentlemen of South Uist met once a
year for sport and enjoyment. Lower down is 'Uamh a Phrionnsa,' the cave
of the prince, where Prince Charlie and some of his followers lived for
several weeks after the disasters of Culloden. It is a small cave, being
only a few feet in depth and breadth. The floor is a steep slope. There
are no crofters in Corradale now nor within many miles, but during the
time of the Prince the whole of this region was full of crofter
families. I have the names of eighty-two crofter families who were
evicted from the district of Corradale some years afterwards. The Prince
and his followers lived there on such homely fare as these hospitable
people could give, and moved about among their houses. Occasional
supplies of linen and other luxuries were brought to them by the
gentlemen of Barra, South Uist, Benbecula, North Uist, and Skye. While
the Prince was in Corradale all the people not only of South Uist but of
all the neighbouring islands knew that he was there. The writer saw and
spoke with men and women whose fathers and mothers had seen and
succoured the Prince. The whole of these faithful people of Corradale,
and hundreds more were evicted and driven to all ends of the earth--many
of them to die moral and physical deaths in the slums of Glasgow

and other cities--in order to add their land to the already extensive
lands of tacksmen, one of these being the parish minister.

Torarnis, Torrarnis, Torrannis, is the point of Thor, the point of the
thunderer. There are two places of this name in South Uist, and in the
neighbourhood of one another, both famed for bere.

There are no nuts there now, nor anywhere in Uist, nor bushes nor trees
of any kind nothing but long reaches of sessile sand here and there
overlying long stretches of compacted peat. Hazel-nuts in great
quantities have been found in Uist lying on the glacial rock. In many
places round the west side of the Outer Hebrides the remains of trees of
various sizes have been found at low-water embedded in the hard peat
moss underlying pure sand.

Torrarnis is mentioned in a poem taken down in 1869 from a woman at
Lianacuith, South Uist. The poem purports to foretell the overflowing of
the Atlantic and the submerging of certain places, including

'The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people,
while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among
whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter
shall race and run and leap and gambol--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This prophecy is
to some extent verified, for vast tracts of lands and woods, and in some
places the remains of dykes, houses, and churches, can be seen along the
coast at low-water.

Carlyle speaks in *Heroes and Hero-Worship* of the boatmen on the
Yorkshire Ouse calling out when the river is in flood--'Eager is coming!
Eager is coming!' 'Eager' is also known on the Severn. In this case the
idea is that of the Norse giant. A deity of this name is also god of the
muses in Celtic mythology.

 

*Eimir*, the wife of Cuchulainn. She is the type of beauty in Gaelic
story. (Vol. i. p. 8.)

 

*Eoir*, spell, charm, incantation. 'Eoir' in Lewis, 'eolas' in Uist.

 

*Eolas*, *eoilse*, *eoisle*, a spell, charm, incantation, magic,
exorcism, knowledge.

*Eorlain*, *earlain*, *arlain*, floor, bottom, lower part, a glen that
slopes to a narrow compass, from 'earr,' limit. The three planks on each
side of the keel of a boat are called 'eorlain,'--'eorlain na
h-eithir'--bottom of the boat, in this case from 'earrlain,' keel.

 

*Eunarag*, snipe, little goat-bird, from 'eun,' bird, 'gobharag,' little
goat. As many as thirteen Gaelic names are applied to the snipe, some of
them in reference to the kid-like cry of the bird. The snipe is one of
the seven dormant birds, of the people. It is 'sained,' and more feared
than liked by nightfarers. (See *Meannanaich*.)
