### DUAN NAN DAOL \[208\]

THERE are many curious legends and beliefs current in the Isles about
the 'cearr-dubhan,' or sacred beetle. When his enemies were in search of
Christ to put Him to death, they met the sacred beetle and the
gravedigger beetle out on a foraging expedition in search of food for
their families. The Jews asked the beetles if they had seen Christ
passing that way. Proud to be asked, and anxious to conciliate the great
people, the gravedigger promptly and volubly replied: 'Yes, yes! He
passed here yesterday evening, when I and the people of the townland
were digging a grave and burying the body of a field-mouse that had come
to an untimely end.' 'You lie! you lie!' said the sacred beetle; 'it was
a year ago yesterday that Christ the Son passed here, when my children
and I were searching for food, after the king's horse had passed.'

Because of his ready officiousness against Christ, the gravedigger is
always killed when seen; while for his desire to shield Christ, the
sacred beetle is spared, but because he told a lie he is always turned
on his back. The sacred beetle is covered with a strong integument like
a knight encased in armour. Consequently he is unable to resume his
position, and he struggles continually, waving his feet in the effort to
touch something which will assist him to rise. It is unlawful to pass by
the sacred beetle without putting him on his back, but should he succeed
in righting himself, it is unlawful to molest him further.

In some places the gravedigger is killed because otherwise he will
profane the grave of the grandmother of the person who passes him by.

The following somewhat similar legend is also current in Uist:--

The anti-Christians were pursuing Christ, wishing to kill Him. Christ
came to a townland where a crofter was winnowing corn on the hillock.
The good crofter placed Christ under the heap of grain to conceal Him
from his enemies. The crofter went into the barn to bring out more grain
to place over Christ to hide Him more effectually. In his absence the
fowls attacked the heap of corn under which Christ was hidden. They were
round the heap and over the heap--hens and ducks feeding as rapidly as
they could. The ducks contented themselves with eating and tramping the
corn. Not so the hens: they scattered the corn about with their feet as
they ate, so that the hidden Christ was exposed to view when the crofter
returned. In consequence of this disservice to Christ in His distress,
it was left as a heritage to the hen and to her seed for ever that she
should be sever-toed; that she should be confined to land; that

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

she should dislike hail, rain, sleet, and snow; that she should dread
thunder and lightning; that dust, not water, should be her bath; that
she should have no oil with which to annoint herself and preen her
feathers; and finally, that she should have only one life and only one
joy in life--the joy of land.

And because the duck contented herself with eating the corn without
exposing the person of Christ, it was left to her and her descendants
ever more that she should be web-footed, and not be confined to land;
that she should rejoice in hail and rain and sleet and snow; that she
should rejoice in thunder and lightning; that water not dust should be
her bath; that she should have oil with which to anoint herself and
preen her feathers; that she should have three lives and three joys--the
joy of earth, the joy of air, and the joy of water; nay, a fourth life
and a fourth joy--the joy of under the water; that she should be most
dressed when the hen was most draggled; that she should be most joyous
when the hen was most miserable; that she should be most hopeful when
the hen was in most despair; that she should be most happy when the hen
was in most dread; that she should dance with joy when the hen quaked
with fear. When the hen hears thunder she trembles as the aspen and
hurries home in terror, screaming and screeching the while. Hence the
saying--

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>'Tha do chridh air chrith<br />
Mar chirc ri torruinn.'</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>Thine heart is quivering<br />
Like a hen in thunder.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

The converse is true of the duck. When she hears thunder she rejoices
and dances to her own 'port-a-bial'--mouth music. This gave rise to the
saying--

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>'Is coltach thu ri tunnaig<br />
’S a fiughair ri torruinn.'</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>Thou art like a duck<br />
Expectant of thunder.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>
