# NOTES

### A

*Abhr*, *abhra*, fat, rich, oily; 'cloimh abhrais,' oiled wool, wool
prepared for spinning; 'abhrta,' 'abhrtach,' 'abhrtadh,' a feast,
festival, rich entertainment.

 

*Abhr*, *aur*, prayer (?). A place at the, base of 'Beinn Righ
Coinnich'--King Kenneth's Mount, or 'Beinn airidh Coinnich'--Ben of
Kenneth's shieling, in South Uist, is called 'Auratot,' 'Auratobhte,'
prayer ruin. The spot is green and grassy, and contains the remains of
an oratory, which was used by seafarers before and after voyaging. A
font and other ecclesiastical objects have been found among the ruins.
*Cf*. 'aurtech,' gen. 'aurtige'; 'for bendchopar ind aurtige,'--on the
roof of the oratory.--Windisch's *Wörterbuch*. Perhaps merely a
diphthongised form of 'or,' prayer, as in 'abhran,' 'oran.'

 

*Acair*, anchor. The anchor in the West is often a stone. A form of
anchor in olden times was a cylinder made of heather ropes bound
strongly together, closed at one end and filled with stones. This anchor
was called 'mogais,' cylinder. At anchor, 'air chruaidh,' lit. 'on
hard,' fast.

 

*Adhamhnan*, Adamnan. There are several dedications in Scotland to St
Adamnan. There is a 'Port Adhamhnain,' port of Adamnan, in Iona, Mull,
and Lismore. A cross called 'Crois Adhamhnain,' cross of Adamnan, stood
above the port of Adamnan in Iona, and there is a 'Crois Adhamhnain,'
cross of Adamnan, in North Uist. This cross is incised on a large ice
block at which the saint is said to have stood when preaching the first
Gospel message to the natives. The people are said to have cut the cross
on the side and set the stone on edge in honour of the occasion. There
is a 'Srath Adhamhnain,' Strath Adamnan, in Strathfillan. Near Strath of
Adamnan is 'Beinn Chaluim,' mountain of Columba. Adamnan was the
successor and biographer of Columba.

 

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

*Ai*, sheep. 'Cuir a stigh an ai,' put in the sheep. Perhaps connected
with Greek *aix*, a goat.

 

*Ai*, swan. 'Chi mi ai air loch a mhuilinn,' I see a swan on the mill
loch. 'Chi mi ai air ailn an eilein,' I see a swan on the loch of the
island. 'Ai' seems to mean white, whiteness; perhaps akin to 'aigh,'
beautiful.

 

*Aibheis*, *eibheis*, an abyss, a place or person in ruins or unkempt.

as swift as the thoughts of the foolish women.

 

*Ailbh*, *al*, rock foundation, anything hard, solid, rigid, immovable.

 

*Ailinde*, most beautiful. The people use many forms of this
superlative, as 'ailne,' 'ailindeach,' 'aildiche,' 'aluinnde,' and
others.

</div>

 

*Aingeal*, *ainheal*, *aitheal*, *athal*, light, flame, fire, glowing
fire, angel. *Cf*. 'aithine,' 'athaine,' 'aine,' fire, glowing peat.

'Aingeal' occurs in many place-names, as 'Tom Aingil,' 'Dun Aingil,'
'Cnoc Aingil,' 'Carn Aingil,' in Lochaber, Lismore, Islay, Iona,
Muckairn, Uist, Lewis, and other places. As the names indicate, the
places stand high. Dun Aingil in Lochaber is situated on the side of a
mountain 686 feet above the sea, and is also called 'Cladh Choireil,' St
Cyril's Burial-ground. This is the only 'angil' knoll known to me used
as a place of burial, though at Muckairn a 'Cnoc Aingil' or 'Tulach
Aingil' adjoins the burying-ground, 105 feet above sea-level, called by
some 'Cladh Choireil,' Cyril's Burial-ground, and by others 'Cladh
Easbuig Earail,' Bishop Harold's Burial-ground. Harold was the first
bishop of the see of Argyll and the Isles, disjoined from that of
Dunkeld in 1200.

'Cnoc Aingil' in Iona is a green knoll on a sandy plain. In his 'Life of
Columba,' Adamnan says that angels were wont to converse with Columba on
this knoll, and that during drought the brethren carried the tunic of
the saint round the knoll singing psalms and repeating prayers the
while, whereupon copious rain

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

fell. Pennant mentions that the people of Iona rode sunwise round 'Cnoc
Aingil' on St Michael's Day.

Probably these knolls were places of sun-worship and fire-worship, which
were current in the West as they are in the East.

In a poem composed over two centuries ago, 'aingeal' is twice used for
fire--

'Aingeal' meaning fire is current in some districts though obsolete in
others. The word is borrowed into Scots and applied to the hearth, as
'ingle,' 'ingle-neuk'--neuk being from 'an iuc,' '’n iuc,' the corner,
the angle.

The idea of an angel guarding the door is not unknown to literary art.
At an inn visited by Burns an angel was painted above the door. The
house was kept by a husband and wife whose names were Peace and Grace.
When Burns revisited the place he found the angel gone, the husband
dead, and the wife more gracious than graceful, on which he composed the
following lines:--

*Airil*, the angel Ariel. The people speak of 'Airil nan og,' Ariel of
the youth; 'Airil ail nan og,' Ariel beauteous of the youth, and other
endearing terms. Those who were under his care enjoyed perpetual youth
and perpetual beauty. Ariel is called the 'city of Judah,' 'the strength
of God,' 'the lion of God,' and other favoured names.

 

*Āis*, milk, milk preparation; dainty, delicacy, nectar, ambrosia.

 

*Āis*, wisdom. 'Ais na mna sithe,' the wisdom of the fairy woman. (See
'cnoc.')

 

*Alc*, *fhalc*, *falc*. In some districts 'alc' is applied to the
razor-bill (*alca torda*), and in some to the guillemot (*uria troile*).
The razor-bill and the guillemot resemble one another closely, and at
some

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

distance can only be distinguished by the practised eye. In Cornwall
both birds go by the name of 'mum' from the sounds they emit. The
guillemot, however, is slightly larger and more graceful, and its bill
is long, pointed, and smooth, while that of the razor-bill is shorter,
more rounded, and more furrowed towards the point. The eggs, like the
birds, resemble one another in shape, size, and markings.

A crofter in Lewis, a shrewd, sensible man, went under the name of
'Alcag,' Little 'Alc.' He had come to Lewis from Mull. Mackenzie of
Lewis and he had frequent wit-combats, generally to the discomfiture of
the former. On one occasion Mackenzie, with whom the man was a
favourite, and a friend met the 'Alcag' returning from Stornoway with a
pot on his head, when Mackenzie said, 'I will pay you the price of the
pot if you will allow me to make a rune upon you without retorting,' and
proceeded:--

one which she places in the hand of the woman to increase her faith and
distract her attention. It was consecrated on the altar and much
venerated.
