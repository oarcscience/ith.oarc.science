man, name omitted, by the Rev. John G. Campbell, Tiree.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[380:5](cg2122.htm#fr_51) He had innumerable
interesting and instructive stories about foxes and other wild animals,
among which he had lived most of his long life of nearly one hundred
years.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[380:6](cg2122.htm#fr_52) He had many
interesting stories of birds and of bird-lore.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[380:7](cg2122.htm#fr_53) She had many curious
stories of 'frithean agus frithirean,' auguries and augurers, and of the
'da shealladh,' two-sights--stories that would have interested
psychologists.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[380:8](cg2122.htm#fr_54) She had some beautiful
St Kilda songs, but the people of St Kilda deprecated all secular music,
poetry, and old lore.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[380:9](cg2122.htm#fr_55) From Derry.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[380:10](cg2122.htm#fr_56) Her isolated little
cot stood among the green grassy mounds of the ruined nunnery.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[380:11](cg2122.htm#fr_57) A highly intelligent
man, for whose knowledge of old lore I am greatly indebted in this work.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[380:12](cg2122.htm#fr_58) *Née* Robertson--a
bright, beautiful woman, who possessed many beautiful songs and airs,
which died with her.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[380:13](cg2122.htm#fr_59) Mr Iain Campbell of
Islay and, for him, the distinguished scholar Mr Hector Maclean, Islay,
took down many tales from this reciter. I wrote down many more, but all
three of us made little impression upon the old man's abundant lore. I
noted from him the names and characters of several score of long heroic
tales, any or all of which he was ready to dictate to me. Amongst them
was a very long, complete, and wondrously fine version of Deirdire.
Alexander Macneill said that the version of this tale which I had
already taken down from his brother lain Donn was only a fragment. Yet
this fragment of the story of Deirdire has been pronounced by critics
equal to any ancient or modern classic.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[380:14](cg2122.htm#fr_60) I am indebted to Mr
Stewart for much valuable information regarding Lismore--still an island
of much interest, and anciently of much importance.
