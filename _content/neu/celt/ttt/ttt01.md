PREFACE

 

> THE sentence from Montaigne, which faces the title-page of this little
> book, indicates its scope and purpose.

> It is based upon studies in the philosophy of folk-tales, in the
> course of which a large number of examples of curious beliefs and
> customs bearing on the main incident in certain groups have been
> collected. Some of these are now 'shuffled up together' round an old
> Suffolk tale, whose vivacity and humour secure it the first place
> among the 'Rumpelstiltskin' variants with which it is classed.

> Those who have had experience in the gathering of materials
> illustrative of the several departments of barbaric culture will
> appreciate the difficulty which has been felt in making selections
> that suffice to internret the central idea without obscuring it by a
> multiplicity of examples. If the book, which is designed mainly for
> popular reading, therefore makes no pretence to exhaustiveness, it may
> perhaps have the virtue of being less tedious.
