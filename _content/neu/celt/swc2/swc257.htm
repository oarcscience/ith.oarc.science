<TABLE ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/24700.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE> WITHIN easy memory many parts of the western coast were said to be frequented by mermaids, particularly Sennen Cove. This place was also resorted to by a remarkable spirit called the Hooper&#8212;from the hooting or pooping sounds which it was accustomed to make.</p>  
<p>In old time, according to tradition, a compact cloud of mist often came in from over sea&#8212;when the weather was by no means foggy&#8212;and rested on the rocks called Cowloe, thence it spread itself, like a curtain of cloud, quite across Sennen Cove. By night a dull light was mostly seen amidst the vapour, with sparks ascending as if a fire burned within it; at the same time hooping sounds, were heard proceeding therefrom. People believed the misty cloud shrouded a spirit, which came to forewarn them of approaching storms, and that those who attempted to put to sea found an invisible force&#8212;seemingly in the mist&#8212;to resist them.</p>  
<p>A reckless fisherman and his son, however,&#8212;disregarding the token&#8212;launched their boat and beat through the fog with a threshal (flail); they passed the cloud of mist which followed them, and neither the men, nor the Hooper, were evermore seen in Sennen Cove.</p>  
<p>This is the only place in the west where any tradition of such a guardian spirit is preserved.</p>
