<p>A short time ago, two gentlemen of Penzance walked over to Chysauster, the higher side of Gulval, on a Sunday morning, to inspect the hut-circles, caves, and other remains of what are supposed to have been ancient British habitations. After a fruitless search, the gentlemen returned towards Chysauster to see if they could meet with anyone to inform them where the objects they were in quest of might be found. In the lane they overtook a woman and asked her if she knew of any caves thereabout? "Caaves! no, I don't&#8212;not fit for butchers," she replied, "but if you want any for rearan I think I can tell &#8217;e where there es some to be found; now I look at &#8217;e agen you don't seem much like butchers nether, nor you arn&#8217;t none of our farmers about here ether! Where are &#8217;e coman from at all? Looking for caaves of a Sunday mornan! You are very much in want of them I s&#8217;pose." The gentlemen explained that they neither wanted calves for rearing nor killing, but to find the ancient ruins. "Oh Lord," said she, "you're lookan for the old crellas, and things up in the hill! Why dedn't &#8217;e say so than, that one might know what you meant, instead of givan such outlandish names to things. But come &#8217;e along with me, and I'll show &#8217;e," continued she in turning back and leading the way.</p>
