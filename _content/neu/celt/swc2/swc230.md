### <span class="smallcaps">The St. Levan Stone</span>.

In St. Levan Churchyard is a cloven rock called St. Levan's stone. For
some reason, now unknown, this must have been a venerated object when
the church was built, or it would have been used in the building. The
common notion, however, is that long before St. Levan's time this rock
was regarded as sacred, because Merlin prophecied—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

"When, with panniers astride,  
 A pack-horse one can ride  
 Through St. Levan stone,  
 The world will be done."

It is stated that Merlin came here with King Arthur, when he slaughtered
the Danes at the battle of Velan-drùchar. The separation of this
prophetic stone is so slow that there appears to be no danger of the
world's ending just yet.
