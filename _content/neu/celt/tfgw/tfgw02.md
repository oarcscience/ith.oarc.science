John Connors and the Fairies

> THERE was a man named John Connors, who lived near Killarney, and was
> the father of seven small children, all daughters and no sons. Connors
> fell into such rage and anger at having so many daughters, without any
> sons, that when the seventh daughter was born he would not come from
> the field to see the mother or the child.

> When the time came for christening he wouldn't go for sponsors, and
> didn't care whether the wife lived or died. A couple of years after
> that a son was born to him, and some of the women ran to the field and
> told John Connors that he was the father of a fine boy. Connors was so
> delighted that he caught the spade he had with him and broke it on the
> ditch. He hurried home then and sent for bread and meat, with
> provisions of all kinds to supply the house.

> "There are no people in the parish," said he to the wife, "fit to
> stand sponsors for this boy, and when night comes I'll ride over to
> the next parish and find sponsors there."

> When night came he bridled and saddled his horse, mounted, and rode
> away toward the neighbouring parish to invite a friend and his wife to
> be godfather and godmother to his son. The village to which he was
> going was Beaufort, south of Killarney. There was a public-house on
> the road. Connors stepped in and treated the bystanders, delayed there
> a while, and then went his way. When he had gone a couple of miles he
> met a stranger riding on a white horse, a good-looking gentleman
> wearing red knee-breeches, swallow-tailed coat, and a Caroline hat \[a
> tall hat\].

> The stranger saluted John Connors, and John returned the salute. The
> stranger asked where was he going at such an hour.

> "I'm going," said Connors, "to Beaufort to find sponsors for my young
> son."

> "Oh, you foolish man," said the stranger; "you left the road a mile
> behind you. Turn back and take the left hand."

> John Connors turned back as directed, but never came to a cross-road.
> He was riding about half an hour when he met the same gentleman, who
> asked: "Are you the man I met a while ago going to Beaufort?"

> "I am."

> "Why, you fool, you passed the road a mile or more behind. Turn back
> and take the right hand road. What trouble is on you that you cannot
> see a road when you are passing it?"

> Connors turned and rode on for an hour or so, but found no side road.
> The same stranger met him for the third time, and asked him the same
> question, and told him he must turn back. "But the night is so far
> gone," said he, "that you'd better not be waking people. My house is
> near by. Stay with me till morning. You can go for the sponsors
> to-morrow."

> John Connors thanked the stranger and said he would go with him. The
> stranger took him to a fine castle then, and told him to dismount and
> come in.

> "Your horse will be taken care of," said he, "I have servants enough."

> John Connors rode a splendid white horse, and the like of him wasn't
> in the country round. The gentleman had a good supper brought to
> Connors. After supper he showed him a bed and said, "Take off your
> clothes and sleep soundly till morning."

> When Connors was asleep the stranger took the clothes, formed a corpse
> just like John Connors, put the clothes on it, tied the body to the
> horse, and leading the beast outside, turned its head towards home. He
> kept John Connors asleep in bed for three weeks.

> The horse went towards home and reached the village next morning. The
> people saw the horse with the dead body on its back, and all thought
> it was the body of John Connors. Everybody began to cry and lament for
> their neighbour. He was taken off the horse, stripped, washed, and
> laid out on the table. There was a great wake that night, everybody
> mourning and lamenting over him, for wasn't he a good man and the
> father of a large family? The priest was sent for to celebrate mass
> and attend the funeral, which he did. There was a large funeral.

> Three weeks later John Connors was roused from his sleep by the
> gentleman, who came to him and said:

> "It is high time for you to be waking. Your son is christened. The
> wife, thinking you would never come, had the child baptized, and the
> priest found sponsors. Your horse stole away from here and went home."

> "Sure then I am not long sleeping?"

> "Indeed, then, you are: it is three whole days and nights that you are
> in that bed."

> John Connors sat up and looked around for his clothes, but if he did
> he could not see a stitch of them. "Where are my clothes?" asked he.

> "I know nothing of your clothes, my man, and the sooner you go out o'
> this the better."

> Poor John was astonished. "God help me, how am I to go home without my
> clothes? If I had a shirt itself, it wouldn't be so bad; but to go
> without a rag at all on me!"

> "Don't be talking," said the man; "take a sheet and be off with
> yourself. I have no time to lose on the like of you."

> John grew in dread of the man, and taking the sheet, went out. When
> well away from the place he turned to look at the castle and its
> owner, but if he did there was nothing before him but fields and
> ditches.

> The time as it happened was Sunday morning, and Connors saw at some
> distance down the road people on their way to mass. He hurried to the
> fields for fear of being seen by somebody. He kept to the fields and
> walked close to the ditches till he reached the side of a hill, and
> went along by that, keeping well out of sight. As he was nearing his
> own village at the side of the mountain there happened to be three or
> four little boys looking for stray sheep. Seeing Connors, they knew
> him as the dead man buried three weeks before. They screamed and ran
> away home, some of them falling with fright. When they came to the
> village they cried that they had seen John Connors, and he with a
> sheet on him.

> Now, it is the custom in Ireland when a person dies to sprinkle holy
> water on the clothes of the deceased and then give them to poor people
> or to friends for God's sake. It is thought that by giving the clothes
> in this way the former owner has them to use in the other world. The
> person who wears the clothes must wear them three times to mass one
> Sunday after another and sprinkle them each time with holy water.
> After that they may be worn as the person likes.

> When the women of the village heard the story of the boys some of them
> went to the widow and said:

> "Tis your fault that your husband's ghost is roaming around in
> nakedness. You didn't give away his clothes."

> "I did, indeed," said the wife. "I did my part, but it must be that
> the man I gave them to didn't wear them to mass, and that is why my
> poor husband is naked in the other world."

> Now she went straight to the relative and neighbour who got the
> clothes. As she entered the man was sitting down to breakfast.

> "Bad luck to you, you heathen!" said she. "I did not think you the man
> to leave my poor John naked in the other world. You neither went to
> mass in the clothes I gave you nor sprinkled holy water on them."

> "I did, indeed. This is the third Sunday since John died, and I went
> to mass this morning for the third time. Sure I'd be a heathen to keep
> a relative naked in the other world. It wasn't your husband that the
> boys saw at all."

> She went home then, satisfied that everything had been done as it
> should be.

> An uncle of John Connors lived in the same village. He was a rich
> farmer and kept a servant girl and a servant boy. The turf bog was not
> far away, and all the turf at the house being burned, the servant girl
> was told to go down to the reek \[a long pile of turf\] and bring home
> a creel \[basket\] of turf. She went to the reek and was filling her
> creel, when she happened to look towards the far end of the reek, and
> there she saw a man sticking his head out from behind the turf, and he
> with a sheet on him. She looked a second time and saw John Connors.
> The girl screamed, threw down the creel, and ran away, falling every
> few steps from terror. It was to the reek that Connors had gone, to
> wait there in hiding till dark. After that he could go to his own
> house without any one seeing him.

> The servant girl fell senseless across the farmer's threshold, and
> when she recovered she said: "John Connors is below in the bog behind
> the reek of turf, and nothing but a sheet on him."

> The farmer and the servant boy laughed at her and said: "This is the
> way with you always when there's work to do."

> The boy started off to bring the turf himself, but as he was coming
> near the reek John Connors thrust his head out, and the boy ran home
> screeching worse than the girl. Nobody would go near the reek now, and
> the report went out that John Connors was below in the bog minding the
> turf. Early that evening John Connors' wife made her children go on
> their knees and offer up the rosary for the repose of their father's
> soul. After the rosary they went to bed in a room together, but were
> not long in it when there was a rap at the door. The poor woman asked
> who was outside. John Connors answered that it was himself.

> "May the Almighty God and His blessed Mother give rest to your soul!"
> cried the wife, and the children crossed themselves and covered their
> heads with the bedclothes. They were in dread he'd come in through the
> keyhole; they knew a ghost could do that if it wished.

> John went to the window of two panes of glass and was tapping at that.
> The poor woman looked out, and there she saw her husband's face. She
> began to pray again for the repose of his soul, but he called out:

> "Bad luck to you, won't you open the door to me or throw out some
> clothes? I am perishing from cold."

> This only convinced the woman more surely. John didn't like to break
> the door, and as it was strong, it wouldn't be easy for him to break
> it, so he left the house and went to his uncle's. When he came to the
> door all the family were on their knees repeating the rosary for the
> soul of John Connors. He knocked, and the servant girl rose up to see
> who was outside. She unbolted and unlatched the door, opened it a bit,
> but seeing Connors, she came near cutting his nose off, she shut it
> that quickly in his face. She bolted the door then and began to
> scream: "John Connors' ghost is haunting me! Not another day or night
> will I stay in the house if I live to see morning!"

> All the family fastened themselves in a room and threw themselves into
> bed, forgetting to undress or to finish their prayers. John Connors
> began to kick the door, but nobody would open it; then he tapped at
> the window and begged the uncle to let him in or put out some clothes
> to him, but the uncle and children were out of their wits with fear.

> The doctor's house was the next one, and Connors thought to himself,
> "I might as well go to the doctor and tell all to him; tell him that
> the village is gone mad." So he made his way to the doctor's, but the
> servant boy there roared and screeched from terror when he saw him,
> ran to his master, and said, "John Connors' ghost is below at the
> door, and not a thing but a sheet on him."

> "You were always a fool," said the doctor. "There is never a ghost in
> this world."

> "God knows, then, the ghost of John Connors is at the door," said the
> boy.

> To convince the boy, the master raised the upper window. He looked out
> and saw the ghost sure enough. Down went the window with a slap.

> "Don't open the door!" cried the doctor. "He is below; there is some
> mystery in this."

> Since the doctor wouldn't let him in any more than the others, John
> Connors was cursing and swearing terribly.

> "God be good to us," said the doctor. "His soul must be damned, for if
> his soul was in purgatory it is not cursing and swearing he'd be, but
> praying. Surely, 'tis damned he is, and the Lord have mercy on the
> people of this village; but I won't stay another day in it; I'll move
> to the town to-morrow morning."

> Now John left the doctor's house and went to the priest, thinking that
> he could make all clear to the priest, for everybody else had gone
> mad. He knocked at the priest's door and the housekeeper opened it.
> She screamed and ran away, but left the door open behind her. As she
> was running towards the stairs she fell, and the priest, hearing the
> fall, hurried out to see what the matter was.

> "Oh, father," cried the housekeeper, "John Connors' ghost is below in
> the kitchen, and he with only a sheet on him!"

> "Not true," said the priest. "There is never a person seen after
> parting with this world."

> The words were barely out of his mouth when the ghost was there before
> him.

> "In the name of God," said the priest, "are you dead or alive? You
> must be dead, for I said mass in your house, and you a corpse on the
> table, and I was at your funeral."

> "How can you be foolish like the people of the village? I'm alive. Who
> would kill me?"

> "God, who kills everybody, and but for your being dead, how was I to
> be asked to your funeral?"

> "Tis all a mistake," said John. "If it's dead I was it isn't here I'd
> be talking to you to-night."

> "If you are alive, where are your clothes?"

> "I don't know where they are or how they went from me, but I haven't
> them, sure enough."

> "Go into the kitchen," said the priest. "I'll bring you clothes, and
> then you must tell me what happened to you."

> When John had the clothes on he told the priest that, the day the
> child was born, he went to Beaufort for sponsors, and, being late, he
> met a gentleman, who sent him back and forth on the road and then took
> him to his house. "I went to bed," said John, "and slept till he waked
> me. My clothes were gone from me then, and I had nothing to wear but
> an old sheet. More than this I don't know: but everybody runs from me,
> and my wife won't let me into the house."

> "Oh, then, it's Daniel O'Donohue, King of Lochlein, that played the
> trick on you," said the priest. "Why didn't you get sponsors at home
> in this parish for your son as you did for your daughters? For the
> remainder of your life show no partiality to son or daughter among
> your children. It would be a just punishment if more trouble came to
> you. You were not content with the will of God, though it is the duty
> of every man to take what God gives him. Three weeks ago your supposed
> body was buried and all thought you dead through your own pride and
> wilfulness."

> "That is why my wife wouldn't let me in. Now, your Reverence, come
> with me and convince my wife, or she will not open the door."

> The priest and John Connors went to the house and knocked, but the
> answer they got was a prayer for the repose of John Connors' soul. The
> priest went to the window then and called out to open the door.

> Mrs. Connors opened the door, and seeing her husband behind the priest
> she screamed and fell: a little girl that was with her at the door
> dropped speechless on the floor. When the woman recovered, the priest
> began to persuade her that her husband was living, but she wouldn't
> believe that he was alive till she took hold of his hand: then she
> felt of his face and hair and was convinced.

> When the priest had explained everything he went away home. No matter
> how large his family was in after years, John Connors never went from
> home to find sponsors.
