Daniel Crowley and the Ghosts

> THERE lived a man in Cork whose name was Daniel Crowley. He was a
> coffin-maker by trade, and had a deal of coffins laid by, so that his
> apprentice might sell them when himself was not at home.

> A messenger came to Daniel Crowley's shop one day and told him that
> there was a man dead at the end of the town, and to send up a coffin
> for him, or to make one.

> Daniel Crowley took down a coffin, put it on a donkey cart, drove to
> the wake house, went in and told the people of the house that the
> coffin was there for them. The corpse was laid out on a table in a
> room next to the kitchen. Five or six women were keeping watch around
> it; many people were in the kitchen. Daniel Crowley was asked to sit
> down and commence to shorten the night: that is, to tell stories,
> amuse himself and others. A tumbler of punch was brought, and he
> promised to do the best he could.

> He began to tell stories and shorten the night. A second glass of
> punch was brought to him, and he went on telling tales. There was a
> man at the wake who sang a song: after him another was found, and then
> another. Then the people asked Daniel Crowley to sing, and he did. The
> song that he sang was of another nation. He sang about the good
> people, the fairies. The song pleased the company, they desired him to
> sing again, and he did not refuse.

> Daniel Crowley pleased the company so much with his two songs that a
> woman who had three daughters wanted to make a match for one of them,
> and get Daniel Crowley as a husband for her. Crowley was a bachelor,
> well on in years, and had never thought of marrying.

> The mother spoke of the match to a woman sitting next to her. The
> woman shook her head, but the mother said:

> "If he takes one of my daughters I'll be glad, for he has money laid
> by. Do you go and speak to him, but say nothing of me at first."

> The woman went to Daniel Crowley then, and told him that she had a
> fine, beautiful girl in view, and that now was his time to get a good
> wife; he'd never have such a chance again.

> Crowley rose up in great anger. "There isn't a woman wearing clothes
> that I'd marry," said he. "There isn't a woman born that could bring
> me to make two halves of my loaf for her."

> The mother was insulted now and forgot herself. She began to abuse
> Crowley.

> "Bad luck to you, you hairy little scoundrel," said she, "you might be
> a grandfather to my child. You are not fit to clean the shoes on her
> feet. You have only dead people for company day and night; 'tis by
> them you make your living."

> "Oh, then," said Daniel Crowley, "I'd prefer the dead to the living
> any day if all the living were like you. Besides, I have nothing
> against the dead. I am getting employment by them and not by the
> living, for 'tis the dead that want coffins."

> "Bad luck to you, 'tis with the dead you ought to be and not with the
> living; 'twould be fitter for you to go out of this altogether and go
> to your dead people."

> "I'd go if I knew how to go to them," said Crowley.

> "Why not invite them to supper?" retorted the woman.

> He rose up then, went out, and called:

> "Men, women, children, soldiers, sailors, all people that I have ever
> made coffins for, I invite you to-night to my house, and I'll spend
> what is needed in giving a feast."

> The people who were watching the dead man on the table saw him smile
> when he heard the invitation. They ran out of the room in a fright and
> out of the kitchen, and Daniel Crowley hurried away to his shop as
> fast as ever his donkey could carry him. On the way he came to a
> public-house and, going in, bought a pint bottle of whiskey, put it in
> his pocket, and drove on.

> The workshop was locked and the shutters down when he left that
> evening, but when he came near he saw that all the windows were
> shining with light, and he was in dread that the building was burning
> or that robbers were in it. When right there Crowley slipped into a
> corner of the building opposite, to know could he see what was
> happening, and soon he saw crowds of men, women, and children walking
> toward his shop and going in, but none coming out. He was hiding some
> time when a man tapped him on the shoulder and asked, "Is it here you
> are, and we waiting for you? 'Tis a shame to treat company this way.
> Come now."

> Crowley went with the man to the shop, and as he passed the threshold
> he saw a great gathering of people. Some were neighbours, people he
> had known in the past. All were dancing, singing, amusing themselves.
> He was not long looking on when a man came up to him and said:

> "You seem not to know me, Daniel Crowley."

> "I don't know you," said Crowley. "How could I?"

> "You might then, and you ought to know me, for I am the first man you
> made a coffin for, and 'twas I gave you the first start in business."

> Soon another came up, a lame man: "Do you know me, Daniel Crowley?"

> "I do not."

> "I am your cousin, and it isn't long since I died."

> "Oh, now I know you well, for you are lame. In God's name," said
> Crowley to the cousin, "how am I to get these people out o' this. What
> time is it?"

> "Tis early yet, it's hardly eleven o'clock, man."

> Crowley wondered that it was so early.

> "Receive them kindly," said the cousin; "be good to them, make
> merriment as you can."

> "I have no money with me to get food or drink for them; 'tis night
> now, and all places are closed," answered Crowley.

> "Well, do the best you can," said the cousin.

> The fun and dancing went on, and while Daniel Crowley was looking
> around, examining everything, he saw a woman in the far-off corner.
> She took no part in the amusement, but seemed very shy in herself.

> "Why is that woman so shy--she seems to be afraid?" asked he of the
> cousin. "And why doesn't she dance and make merry like others?"

> "Oh, 'tis not long since she died, and you gave the coffin, as she had
> no means of paying for it. She is in dread you'll ask her for the
> money, or let the company know that she didn't pay," said the cousin.

> The best dancer they had was a piper by the name of John Reardon from
> the city of Cork. The fiddler was one John Healy. Healy brought no
> fiddle with him, but he made one, and the way he made it was to take
> off what flesh he had on his body. He rubbed up and down on his own
> ribs, each rib having a different note, and he made the loveliest
> music that Daniel Crowley had ever heard. After that the whole company
> followed his example. All threw off what flesh they had on them and
> began to dance jigs and hornpipes in their bare bones. When by chance
> they struck against one another in dancing, you'd think it was Brandon
> Mountain that was striking Mount Eagle, with the noise that was in it.

> Daniel Crowley plucked up all his courage to know, could he live
> through the night, but still he thought daylight would never come.
> There was one man, John Sullivan, that he noticed especially. This man
> had married twice in his life, and with him came the two women.
> Crowley saw him taking out the second wife to dance a breakdown, and
> the two danced so well that the company were delighted, and all the
> skeletons had their mouths open, laughing. He danced and knocked so
> much merriment out of them all that his first wife, who was at the end
> of the house, became jealous and very mad altogether. She ran down to
> where he was and told him she had a better right to dance with him
> than the second wife.

> "That's not the truth for you," said the second wife; "I have a better
> right than you. When he married me you were a dead woman and he was
> free, and, besides, I'm a better dancer than what you are, and I will
> dance with him whether you like it or not."

> "Hold your tongue!" screamed the first wife. "Sure, you couldn't come
> to this feast to-night at all but for the loan of another woman's
> shinbones."

> Sullivan looked at his two wives, and asked the second one:

> "Isn't it your own shinbones you have?"

> "No, they are borrowed. I borrowed a neighbouring woman's shins from
> her, and 'tis those I have with me to-night."

> "Who is the owner of the shinbones you have under you?" asked the
> husband.

> "They belong to one Catherine Murray. She hadn't a very good name in
> life."

> "But why didn't you come on your own feet?"

> "Oh, I wasn't good myself in life, and I was put under a penalty, and
> the penalty is that whenever there is a feast or a ball I cannot go to
> it unless I am able to borrow a pair of shins."

> Sullivan was raging when he found that the shinbones he had been
> dancing with belonged to a third woman, and she not the best, and he
> gave a slap to the wife that sent her spinning into a corner.

> The woman had relations among the skeletons present, and they were
> angry when they saw the man strike their friend. 'We'll never let that
> go with him," said they. 'We must knock satisfaction out of Sullivan!"

> The woman's friends rose up, and, as there were no clubs or weapons,
> they pulled off their left arms and began to slash and strike with
> them in terrible fashion. There was an awful battle in one minute.

> While this was going on Daniel Crowley was standing below at the end
> of the room, cold and hungry, not knowing but he'd be killed. As
> Sullivan was trying to dodge the blows sent against him he got as far
> as Daniel Crowley, and stepped on his toe without knowing it; Crowley
> got vexed and gave Sullivan a blow with his fist that drove the head
> from him, and sent it flying to the opposite corner.

> When Sullivan saw his head flying off from the blow he ran, and,
> catching it, aimed a blow at Daniel Crowley with the head, and aimed
> so truly that he knocked him under the bench; then, having him at a
> disadvantage, Sullivan hurried to the bench and began to strangle him.
> He squeezed his throat and held him so firmly between the bench and
> the floor that the man lost his senses, and couldn't remember a thing
> more.

> When Daniel Crowley came to himself in the morning his apprentice
> found him stretched under the bench with an empty bottle under his
> arm. He was bruised and pounded. His throat was sore where Sullivan
> had squeezed it; he didn't know how the company broke up, nor when his
> guests went away.
