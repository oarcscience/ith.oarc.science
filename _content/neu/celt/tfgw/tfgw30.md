John Cokeley and the Fairy

>  

> THERE was a farmer in the parish of Firez whose name was John Cokeley.
> John was a great man for every kind of new information, and would go a
> long way of an evening to hear people read newspapers, but he didn't
> give in to stories or to what old people used to say.

> Cokeley thought the house he had too small and wanted to put an
> addition to it. There was an old passage at one end of the house, and
> it's there he was going to build the addition. John had a gossip who
> used to go with the fairies, and this man passed the way when he was
> beginning the work.

> "What's that you are doing?" asked the gossip.

> "Don't you see what I am doing?" said Cokeley.

> "Couldn't you put the addition to the other end of the house and leave
> this one alone?"

> "That wouldn't suit me," answered John.

> "You should leave the passage open so that every one could travel
> through it by day, and especially by night."

> "That's foolish talk," said Cokeley.

> "Very well," said the gossip, "you think so I suppose, but my word for
> it, you may be sorry in the end."

> Cokeley finished the addition, and left a little hole in the wall near
> the fireplace, and it was there he kept his pipe and tobacco. One
> night on going to bed he put an ounce of tobacco in the hole (there
> was no one smoking in the house but himself). In the morning there was
> no bit of the tobacco left, but in place of it the price,
> three-pence-ha'penny. He took great notice of that. A few weeks later
> he rose from his bed in the night and heard a great noise of horsemen
> outside. He opened the door and looked out, but if he did he saw
> nothing. He went to bed again, and wasn't long there when he began to
> be sore and feel very sick in himself. The gossip came to see him next
> day: "Well, John," said he, "you feel sick to-day."

> "I do," said Cokeley.

> "You had a right to stop in bed."

> "How well you know of that," said Cokeley.

> "I do; that much could not be done unknown to me. When you turned back
> from the door last night there was a crowd between you and the bed as
> big as at any fair. They gave you only a warning this time, and you'll
> recover."

> In a few weeks' time Cokeley was looking well again, but he got
> downhearted, took to drinking, and spent his means, so that at last he
> hadn't any cows on his land but what belonged to others. One May-day
> in the evening he was going to a neighbour's to collect grazing money
> that was due to him. When about three-quarters of the way--and the
> time was after sunset--a woman appeared opposite and took a great fall
> out of him. He was thrown on his face in the middle of the road and
> struck senseless. In half an hour he recovered, rose, and walked on;
> after going a short distance he was knocked a second time, and soon
> after he got the third fall. Cokeley didn't know for a full hour where
> he was; he hadn't his senses. When he came to himself he was in the
> middle of the road; he crawled to the side of it, then rose and went
> for his money. He didn't tell the man what had happened, made no
> delay, but hurried home and went to bed. He felt the strength parting
> from his body in the night, and was without any power to move next
> morning. His wife ran to doctors for cures, but no use for her. In a
> month's time all the neighbours said that Cokeley was fairy struck,
> and there was no cure. The wife went one day to Killarney, where she
> met the gossip.

> "John is very bad again," said the gossip.

> "He is," said she. "There is no one to do good for him if you don't."

> "Oh, well," said the gossip, "I have a son of my own to assist, and he
> is nearer to me than what John is; I must look out for myself. John
> was struck very severely, and he may thank himself for it. He was not
> said by me, or he wouldn't have built in the passage, and wouldn't be
> where he is to-day. This is all the cure I can give you: Go home, get
> a tub of water, and bathe John nine nights with the one water, one
> night after another. When you have that done you'll not throw out the
> water till after midnight, when all are in bed. Take care that no one
> of your family is out of the house that night."

> When John's wife was in the road coming home a man of the neighbours
> overtook her and they walked on together. There was a height within
> one mile of the house; from this they had a fine view of Cokeley's
> house and land--the time was after sunset--and to their surprise they
> saw John himself walking around in the garden as well and strong as
> ever, but when the wife came home she found him in bed, sick and
> miserable.

> "Were you out since morning, John?" asked she.

> He only began to scold and look bitter at her. "How could a dead man
> leave the bed?" said he.

> She prepared the tub of water in the corner of the house that day, and
> was bathing him for nine nights in the same water. She had a son
> fifteen or sixteen years of age who wasn't at home. He spent a night
> out very often, for he was working for people. She didn't think the
> boy would come that time, it was so late (about one o'clock in the
> morning). She began to throw out the water with a gallon.\* There was
> a big flag^ outside the door; she threw the water on that. She had all
> out but the last gallon, when who should come but the son. When he
> stepped on the flag he was thrown heels over head and his leg broken.
> There was no doctor nearer than Killarney. When the mother went there
> next day she met the gossip.

> "Well," said he, "you are worse now than ever. Didn't I tell you not
> to throw out that water when there was any one away from the house?"

> "He slept out so often," said the mother, "that I was sure he wouldn't
> come that night."

> "You may thank your friends and neighbours \[of the other world\] for
> being so strong, or your son's brains would be knocked out on that
> flag. He'll not be long recovering. The washing did no good to John,
> but he'll not leave you yet; he's very far back in the ranks. He will
> not go from you till he'll be the front man. Don't take too much care
> of him; he'll rob you."

> When a neighbour came in the sick man had a tongue for any attorney,
> complaining of the wife, saying that she was only starving him. He
> would eat nothing from the poor woman but the best meat, butter and
> eggs; he should get a pint of whiskey every day. Every day he should
> be placed in a chair and brought to the fire between two persons. By
> looking at him you'd think there was nothing amiss with the man;
> besides, he had such an appetite and such a tongue for talking.

> Soon the neighbours stopped coming, and didn't inquire. They used to
> see John Cokeley walking about the farm after sunset and before
> sunrise; they thought he was well again. This went on about four
> years, and the gossip who used to be with the fairies left this world
> altogether.

> In the latter end the wife couldn't give the sick man what food he
> wanted, and he was raging; he kept the appetite all the time. She had
> a third cousin, a priest, and the priest came to see her.

> "Oh, father, can't you do some good for my husband? Myself and my poor
> children are beggared from him."

> "It isn't in my power to do good to that man," said the priest. "You
> must leave him there till he is taken from you."

> She told how the husband abused her, what a tongue he had. "Don't give
> him another tint of whiskey," said the priest, "nor meat, nor eggs.
> Give him what you and your children have."

> The man gave a bitter look at the priest. The priest gave a good
> morning and went home. After this the poor woman put no food before
> him but such as she and the children used. He was pining away and
> hadn't half the speech he had before, but he called her all the names
> he could think of. If he could have killed her he would.

> It continued on in this way till one month before seven years were
> out, he pining, she breaking her heart with poverty.

> This month he was sleeping all the time. They knew there was a change
> coming.

> One midnight they heard a great crowd racing around the house, a noise
> of horses and people about the cross-road, and hurricanes of wind with
> terrible noises.

> "Ah, I'll be going home soon," said he on the following morning. "I'm
> not sorry to leave you."

> "Would you like to have a priest, John?" asked the wife.

> 'What would I do with a priest, woman?"

> The uproar continued three nights. On the third evening he asked to
> eat--said he was starved. She gave him plenty of what she had and he
> ate willingly, without any word at all from him. Herself and son and
> the little family, five altogether, were talking, and in an hour's
> time, when they didn't hear any sound from him, they went to the bed
> and found that it's dead he was, and they were not sorry after him;
> and sure why should they, for it wasn't John Cokeley that was in it at
> all.
