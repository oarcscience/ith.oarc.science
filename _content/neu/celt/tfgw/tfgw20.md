Fairy Cows

(told by William Keating)

>  

> IN the parish of Drummor lived a farmer, whose name was Tom Connors.
> He had a nice bit of land and four cows. He was a fine, strong, honest
> man, and had a wife and five children.

> Connors had one cow which was better than the other three, and she
> went by the name of Cooby. She got that name because her two horns
> turned in toward her eyes. They used to feed her often at the house,
> and she was very gentle, and had a heifer calf every year for five or
> six years.

> On one corner of Connors' farm there was a fairy fort, and the cow
> Cooby used to go into the fort, but Connors always drove her out, and
> told his wife and boys to keep her away from the fort, "for," said he,
> "it isn't much luck there is for any cow or calf that is fond of going
> into these fairy forts."

> Soon they noticed that Cooby's milk was failing her and that she was
> beginning to pine away, and though she had the same food at home as
> before, nothing would do her but to go to the fort.

> One morning when Connors went to drive his cows home to be milked he
> found Cooby in the field and her forelegs broken. He ran home that
> minute for a knife, killed and skinned the cow, made four parts of the
> carcase, put the pieces in a hamper, and carried the hamper home on
> his back.

> What of the meat himself and family didn't eat fresh he salted, and
> now and then of a Sunday evening or a holiday they had a meal of it
> with cabbage, and it lasted a long time.

> One morning after Tom was gone to the bog to cut turf the wife went
> out to milk, and what should she see but a cow walking into the fort,
> and she the living image of Cooby. Soon the cow came out, and with her
> a girl with a pail and spancel.

> "Oh, then," said Mrs. Connors, "I'd swear that is Cooby, only that we
> are after eating the most of her. She has the white spots on her back
> and the horns growing into her eyes."

> The girl milked the cow, and then cow and girl disappeared. Mrs.
> Connors meant to tell her husband that night about the cow, but she
> forgot it, they having no meat for supper.

> The following day Tom went again to cut turf, the woman went to milk,
> and again she saw the cow go into the fort, and the girl come out with
> a pail and a spancel. The girl tied the cow's legs, and sifting under
> her began to milk.

> "God knows 'tis the very cow, and sure why shouldn't I know Cooby with
> the three white spots and the bent horns," thought Mrs. Connors, and
> she watched the cow and girl till the milking was over and thought,
> "I'll tell Tom to-night, and he may do what he likes, but I'll have
> nothing to do with fort or fairies myself."

> When Connors came home in the evening, the first words before him
> were: "Wisha then, Tom, I have the news for you to-night."

> "And what news is it?" asked Tom.

> "You remember Cooby?"

> "Why shouldn't I remember Cooby, and we after eating the most of her?"

> "Indeed then, Tom, I saw Cooby to-day, and she inside in the fort and
> a girl milking her."

> "Don't be making a fool of yourself. Is it the cow we are eating that
> would be in the fort giving milk?"

> "Faith, then, I saw her and the three white spots on her back."

> "But what is the use in telling me the like of that," said Tom, "when
> we haven't but two or three bits of her left inside in the tub?"

> "If we haven't itself, I saw Cooby to-day."

> 'Well, I'll go in the morning, and if it's our Cooby that's in it I'll
> bring her home with me," said Tom, "if all the devils in the fort were
> before me."

> "Ah, Tom, if it's to the fort you'll be going, don't forget to put
> holy water over you before you go."

> Early in the morning Tom started across his land, and never stopped
> till he came to the fort, and there, sure enough, he saw the cow
> walking in through the gap to the fort, and he knew her that minute.

> "Tis my cow Cooby," said Connors, "and I'll have her. I'd like to see
> the man would keep her from me."

> That minute the girl came out with her pail and spancel and was going
> up to Cooby.

> "Stop where you are; don't milk that cow!" cried Connors, and
> springing toward the cow he caught her by the horn. "Let go the cow,"
> said Tom; "this is my cow. It's a year that she's from me now. Go to
> your master and tell him to come out to me."

> The girl went inside the fort and disappeared; but soon a fine-looking
> young man came and spoke to Connors. "What are you doing here, my
> man," asked he, "and why did you stop my servant from milking the
> cow?"

> "She is my cow," said Tom, "and by that same token I'll keep her; and
> that's why I stopped the girl from milking her."

> "How could she be your cow? Haven't I this cow a long time, and aren't
> you after eating your own cow?"

> "I don't care what cow I'm after eating," said Tom. "I'll have this
> cow, for she is my Cooby."

> They argued and argued. Tom declared that he'd take the cow home. "And
> if you try to prevent me," said he to the man, "I'll tear the fort to
> pieces or take her with me."

> "Indeed, then, you'll not tear the fort."

> Tom got so vexed that he made at the man. The man ran and Tom after
> him into the fort. When Tom was inside he forgot all about fighting.
> He saw many people dancing and enjoying themselves, and he thought,
> "Why shouldn't I do the like myself?" With that he made up to a
> fine-looking girl, and, taking her out to dance, told the piper to
> strike up a hornpipe, and he did.

> Tom danced till he was tired. He offered twopence to the piper, but
> not a penny would the piper take from him.

> The young man came up and said, 'Well, you are a brave man and
> courageous, and for the future we'll be good friends. You can take the
> cow."

> "I will not take her; you may keep her and welcome, for you are all
> very good people."

> "Well," said the young man, "the cow is yours, and it's why I took her
> because there were many children in the fort without nurses, but the
> children are reared now, and you may take the cow. I put an old stray
> horse in place of her and made him look like your own beast, and it's
> an old horse you're eating all the year. From this out you'll grow
> rich and have luck. We'll not trouble you, but help you."

> Tom took the cow and drove her home. From that out Tom Connors' cows
> had two calves apiece and his mare had two foals and his sheep two
> lambs every year, and every acre of the land he had gave him as much
> crop in one year as another man got from an acre in seven. At last
> Connors was a very rich man; and why not, when the fairies were with
> him?
