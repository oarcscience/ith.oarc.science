The Ghost of Sneem

>  

> SOME time after Pat Doyle was killed by the ghost, my husband, Martin
> Doyle, was at work on an estate at some distance from Sneem, and one
> evening the gentleman who employed Martin told him to go that night on
> an errand to Sneem.

> "Well," said he, "it's too late and the road is very lonesome. There
> is no one to care for my mother but me, and if anything should happen
> to me she'd be without support. I'll go in the morning."

> "That will not do," said the gentleman: "I want to send a letter, and
> it must be delivered to-night."

> "I'll not risk it; I'll not go," said Martin.

> Martin had a cousin James, who heard the conversation and, stepping
> up, he said, "I'll go. I am not afraid of ghost or spirit, and many a
> night have I spent on that road."

> The gentleman thanked him and said:

> "Here is a sword for you, if you need it." He gave James the letter
> with directions for delivering it.

> James started off, and took every short cut and by-path, and when he
> thought he was half-way to Sneem a ghost stood before him in the road,
> and began to make at him. Whenever the ghost came near, James made a
> drive at him with the steel sword, for there is great virtue in steel,
> and above all in steel made by an Irish blacksmith. The ghost was
> darting at James, and he driving at the ghost with his sword till he
> came to a cross-road near Sneem. There the ghost disappeared, and
> James hurried on with great speed to Sneem. There he found that the
> gentleman who was to receive the letter had moved to a place six miles
> away, near Blackwater bridge, half-way between Sneem and Kenmare. The
> place has a very bad name to this day, and old people declare that
> there is no night without spirits and headless people being around
> Blackwater bridge. James knew what the place was, but he made up his
> mind to deliver the letter. When he came to the bridge and was going
> to cross it a ghost attacked him. This ghost had a venomous look and
> was stronger than the first one. He ran twice at James, who struck at
> him with the sword. Just then he saw a big man without a head running
> across the road at the other side of the bridge and up the cliff,
> though there was no path there. The ghost stopped attacking and ran
> after the headless man. James crossed the bridge and walked a little
> farther, when he met a stranger, and the two saluted each other and
> the man asked James where he lived, and he said: "I came from
> Drumfada." "Do you know what time it is?" asked James. "I do not; but
> when I was passing that house just below there the cocks were
> beginning to crow. Did you see anything?" "I did," said James, and he
> told him how the ghost attacked him and then ran away up the cliff
> after the headless man.

> "Oh," said the stranger, "that headless body is always roaming around
> the bridge at night; hundreds of people have seen it. It ran up the
> cliff and disappeared at cock-crow, and the ghost that attacked you
> followed when the cocks crowed."

> The stranger went on and James delivered the letter. The man who
> received it was very thankful and paid him well. James came home safe
> and sound, but he said: "I'd be a dead man this day but for the
> steel."

>  

>  

> "Could you tell me a real fairy tale?" asked I of the old woman. "I
> could," said she, "but to-day I'll tell you only what I saw one night
> beyond Cahirciveen:

>  

>  

> Once I spent the night at a house near Waterville, about six miles
> from Derrynane. The woman of the house was lying in bed at the time
> and a young child with her. The husband heard an infant crying outside
> under the window, and running to the bed he said:

> "Yerra, Mary, have you the child with you?"

> "Indeed, then, I have, John."

> "Well, I heard a child crying under the window. I'll go this minute
> and see whose it is."

> "In the name of God," screamed the wife, "stop inside! Get the holy
> water and sprinkle it over the children and over me and yourself."

> He did this, and then sprinkled some in the kitchen. He heard the
> crying go off farther and farther till it seemed half a mile away: it
> was very pitiful and sad. If he had gone to the door the man of the
> house would have got a fairy stroke and the mother would have been
> taken as a nurse to the fort.

>  

>  

> This is all the old woman told. When going she promised to come on the
> following day, but I have not seen her since. The blind man informed
> me some evenings later that she was sick and in the "ashpitl"
> (hospital). Her sickness was caused, as she said, by telling me tales
> in the daytime. Many of the old people will tell tales only in the
> evening; it is not right, not lucky, to do so during daylight.
