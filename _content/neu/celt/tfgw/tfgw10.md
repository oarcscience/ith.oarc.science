Tom Connors and the Dead Girl

> "THAT is a droll story, and may be true," said John Malone, "though it
> doesn't stand to reason that the mother could run as fast as her son,
> and he as much in dread of the man in the graveyard as herself. But,
> true or false, sure there is neither ghost nor fairy in it." "There is
> not," said Maurice Fitzgerald; "and now I'll give you, not a story,
> but an account of what happened to a man named Tom Connors, who lived
> beyond Dingle, and there's a ghost in it. Connors told me all himself,
> and it's only a year since he died."

>  

>  

> In the year 1846 Tom Connors was working on the road between Slea Head
> and Ventry with other men. One morning he asked a fellow-workman for
> tobacco.

> "I have only enough to last through the day," said the other, "but
> here are threepence for you, and at breakfast-time take your bread and
> walk up the road and you'll find an old woman selling tobacco. When
> you are paid next time give back the threepence to me."

> "Very well," said Connors; and when it was breakfast-time he took his
> bread and went along the road, eating, till he came to where the old
> woman was, and bought the tobacco.

> Before the next pay-day the man who loaned the three-pence fell ill.
> Connors carried the money in his pocket a long time, hearing each day
> that the man was getting better, and expecting that he would see him
> the next day. One morning Connors was going to his work and had
> reached the bridge this side of Rahin. Just beyond that he saw the man
> who loaned him the money, and he coming toward him. The man was so
> near that Connors put his hand in his vest pocket and took out the
> threepence to pay him, but just then the man sprang on a ditch at
> right angles with the road and walked along on it over a bog.

> Connors started to call to him, but stopped, watched, and saw the man
> jump from the ditch and cross a field; then he went behind a small
> mound, and that was the last of him. Connors walked on a short
> distance and met two men going to work. He saluted them, and asked
> what news had they. So and so died, said they, just before we left the
> house. This was the man who loaned Connors the threepence and had just
> crossed the bog. Connors said nothing to the two men about seeing him,
> at the time; but the eyes were leaving his head, he was in such
> amazement. Later, he gave the threepence to some poor persons and told
> them to pray for the man.

> Fifty years ago it was a common thing to have dances wherever a
> fiddler happened to stop, and in those days strolling fiddlers were
> seen often. When Tom Connors, the man I mentioned, was young and
> unmarried, he found one evening that all the young people had gone
> away to dance; so he went on alone to Rahonain, for he thought it was
> there the dance was, but when he came to the place he was told that it
> was in the next village.

> Connors started off towards the village without waiting. The place was
> lonely, and he had gone only a short distance past a forge by the
> wayside when he saw a woman following him. Thinking that she was some
> girl going to the dance, and that he could chat with her, he waited
> till she was near; he saw then that she was a girl who died some time
> before. He had danced with her often while she was in this world. He
> turned into a field to go by a short cut to the village; she followed.
> He said nothing, but hurried as much as he could; she was always close
> behind. Without saying a word, she was waiting for Connors to speak to
> her. When he reached the house where the dance was, young men and
> women were standing outside. The dead girl was right there behind him;
> he was terribly frightened, pressed in between the people and the
> house, and stood with his back to the wall. She went around and passed
> between the people and Connors--passed so near him that her clothes
> brushed his breast and her eyes looked into his eyes. Still he didn't
> speak to her. Then she went away across the field and disappeared.
