Notes on Welsh Pronunciation

 

Welsh pronunciation is not nearly so difficult as it is popularly
supposed to be. With the exception of y, every letter has an invariable
value, and is always pronounced.

 

VOWELS.

 

a short: pronounced as in p*a*n

.

a long    ,,     ,,               f*a*ther.

e short   ,,     ,,               p*e*n.

e long    ,,                       like the first element of the
diphthong in l*a*ne.

 

i short    ,,                       as in p*i*n.

i long     ,,     ,,               mach*i*ne.

o short   ,,     ,,               c*o*t.

o long    ,,                       like the first element of the
diphthong in n*o*te

.

u           ,,                       (approximately) like the French *u*
in s*u*r.

w short  ,,                       like the *oo* in w*oo*d.

w long   ,,      ,,              like the *oo* in w*oo*ed.

y           ,,                       sometimes like *u* in b*u*t, and
sometimes (approximately) like the French *u* in s*u*r.

 

DIPHTHONGS.

 

They may be pronounced by giving to each of the component vowels the
value indicated above.

 

CONSONANTS.

 

c is always pronounced as *k, chi* as in the Scotch lo*ch*, *dd* as *th*
in breathe, *f* as *v, ff* as *f*, s is always hard, as in lo*ss*; *ll*
represents a spirant *l,* a very difficult sound to represent in
English--Englishmen generally render it as *thl*.

 

ACCENT.

 

The accent is nearly always on the last syllable but one (or penult) as
Elidyr, Seithényn.

 

EXAMPLES.

 

Gwyddno = Gwithno, th as in breathe; Gwenhúdiw = Gwenhid-ue; Syfáddon =
Syváthon, th as in breathe; Dwt = Dŏot, oo as in wood; Pwca = Pŏoka, oo
as in wood; Ardúdwy = Ardidŏoi; Llwyd = Llōōid, ll the spirant l, oo as
in wooed.
