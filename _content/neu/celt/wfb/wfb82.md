Llyn Llech Owen

THERE was a man living on Mynydd Mawr, in Carmarthenshire, who had a
magic well. Over this he kept a large flat stone, which he was always
careful to replace over its mouth after he had satisfied himself or his
beast with water.

One summer evening Owen Glyndwr was passing through these parts of the
ancient kingdom of South Wales, and he and his horse were weary and
spent. He chanced upon this well, and removing the covering stone, drank
long and deep draughts of the bubbling fountain, and gave to his parched
steed. He then went on his way, without sealing the spring, and lodged
for the night at Dyllgoed Farm close by. In the night he was awakened by
the sound of flowing waters, and looking out saw a dark lake where the
emerald meadows had smiled, white with flocks. Saddling his horse, he
rode round the flood, and the horse's track in galloping round the water
put a stop to its further overflow. This is the origin of Llyn Llech
Owen, the Lake of Owen's Flag.
