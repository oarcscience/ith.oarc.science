# ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The books mentioned below have been of much assistance to me while
preparing these tales of Ancient Ireland, and I hereby express my
indebtedness to the authors of the respective volumes.

Graves, Alfred Perceval, *Songs of Erin*. Boosey & Co., London.

Gregory, Lady Isabella Augusta, *Book of Saints and Wonders*. Charles
Scribner's Sons.

Hull, Eleanor, *Textbook of Irish Literature*. Benziger Brothers.

Hyde, Douglas, *Literary History of Ireland, from the Earliest Times to
the Present Day*. Charles Scribner's Sons.

Joyce, Patrick Weston, *Ancient Irish, Music*. Longmans, Green & Co.

Keating, Geoffrey (1570?-1644?), *History of Ireland* (*Foras Feasa ar
Eirinn’*, preface signed by the author in 1629).

Mangan, James Clarence, *Complete Poems*. P. J. Kenedy & Sons.

Meyer, Kuno, Translation from the *Book of Lismore*.

Petrie, George, *Ancient Collection of the Music of Ireland*.

*Annals of the Four Masters*. Compiled by three scholars of the historic
O’Clery house and Peregrin O’Duidenan, the historian and genealogist,
early in the seventeenth century, and produced by John Colgan in 1645.
The annals begin with the deluge, and close with the year 1616.

The initial letters used at the beginning of the Tales, and other
decorations in book and cover, are taken from *The Book of Kells*,
acknowledged to be the most beautiful

illuminated vellum in the known world. This ancient volume is the work
of an unnamed Irish monk of Kells monastery in the seventh century. The
weird and commanding beauty of the pages have been at once both the
inspiration and despair of artists for centuries, and the wonder of line
and color would be unbelievable but for the ancient manuscript treasured
at Trinity College, Dublin. The soul of an artist went into the precious
volume known even in tenth-century Europe as the "wonder of the Far
Western World."

The music for the book was arranged by Geraldine G. Saltzberg.

All quoted verses or chants are in italic.
