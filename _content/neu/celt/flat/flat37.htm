<CENTER><H1>Teigue of the Lee</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
&quot;I CAN'T stop in the house - I won't
  stop in it for all the money that is buried in the old. castle of Carrigrohan.
  if ever there was such a thing in the world ! -. to be abused to my face night
  and day, and nobody to the fore doing it ! and then, if I'm angry, to be
  laughed at with a great roaring ho, ho, ho ! I won't stay in the house after,
  to-night, if there was not another place in the country to put my head
  under.&quot; This angry soliloquy was pronounced in the hall of the old
  manor-house of Carrigrohan by John Sheehan. John was a new servant; be had
  been only three days in the house, which had the character of being haunted,
  and in that short space of time be had been abused and laughed at, by a voice
  which sounded as if a man spoke with his head in a cask; nor could he discover
  who was the speaker, or from whence the voice came. &quot;I'll not stop
  here,&quot; said John; &quot;and that ends the matter.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho, ho ! be quiet, John Sheehan,
  or else worse will happen to you.&quot;</P>

  <P>
John instantly ran to the hall window, as
  the words were evidently spoken by a person immediately outside, but no one
  was visible. He had scarcely placed his face at the pane of glass, when he
  heard another loud &quot;Ho, ho, ho !&quot; as if behind him in the hall; as
  quick as lightning he turned his head, but no living thing was to be seen.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho, ho, John !&quot; shouted a
  voice that appeared to come from the lawn before the house; do you think
  you'll see Teigue? - oh, never ! as long as you live ! so leave alone looking
  after him, and mind your business; there's plenty of company to dinner from
  Cork to be here to-day, and 'tis time you had the cloth laid.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord bless us ! there's more of it !
  - I'll never stay another day here,&quot; repeated John.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Hold your tongue, and stay where you
  are quietly, and play no tricks on Mr. Pratt, as you did on Mr. Jervois about
  the spoons.&quot;</P>

  <P>
John Sheehan was confounded by this address
  from his invisible persecutor, but nevertheless he mustered courage enough to
  say -&quot; Who are you? - come here, and let me see you, if you are a
  man;&quot; but he received in reply only a laugh of unearthly derision, which
  was followed by a &quot; Good-by - I'll watch you at dinner, John!&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Lord between us and harm ! this beats
  all ! - I'll watch you at dinner ! - maybe you will; - 'tis the broad
  daylight, so 'tis no ghost; but this is a terrible place, and this is the last
  day I'll stay in it. How does he know about the spoons? - if he tells it, I'm
  a ruined man ! - there was no living soul could tell it to him but Tim
  Barrett, and he's far enough off in the wilds of Botany Bay now, so how could
  he know it - I can't tell for the world ! But what's that I see there at the
  corner of the wall ! - 'tis not a man! - oh, what a fool I am ! 't is only the
  old stump of a tree! - But this is a shocking place - I'll never stop in it,
  for I'll leave the house tomorrow; the very look of it is enough to frighten
  any one.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The mansion had~ certainly an air of
  desolation; it was situated in a lawn, which had nothing to break its uniform
  level, save a few tufts of narcissuses and a couple of old trees coeval with
  the building. The house stood at a short distance from the road, it was
  upwards of a century old, and Time was doing his work upon it; its walls were
  weather-stained in all colours, its roof showed various white patches, it had
  no look of comfort; all was dim and dingy without, and within there was an air
  of gloom; of departed and departing greatness, which harmonised well with the
  exterior. It required all the exuberance of youth and of gaiety to remove the
  impression, almost amounting to awe, with which you trod the huge square hail,
  paced along the gallery which surrounded the hall, or explored the long
  rambling passages below stairs,. The ball-room, as the large drawing-room was
  called, and several other apartments, were in a state of decay: the walls were
  stained with damp; and I remember well the sensation of awe which I felt
  creeping over me when, boy as I was, and full of boyish life, and wild and
  ardent spirits, I descended to the vaults; all without and within me became
  chilled beneath their dampness and gloom - their extent, too, terrified me;
  nor could the merriment of my two schoolfellows, whose father; a respectable
  clergyman, rented the dwelling for a time, dispel the feelings of a romantic
  imagination until I once again ascended to the upper regions.</P>

  <P>
John had pretty well recovered himself as
  the dinner-hour approached, and the several guests arrived. They were all
  seated at table, and had begun to enjoy the excellent repast, when a voice was
  heard from the lawn : -</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho, ho, Mr. Pratt, won't you give
  poor Teigue some dinner ? ho, ho, a fine company you have there, and plenty of
  every thing that's good; sure you won't forget poor Teigue?&quot;</P>

  <P>
John dropped the glass he had in his hand.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Who is that?&quot; said Mr. Pratt's
  brother, an officer of the artillery.</P>

  <P>
&quot;That is Teigue,&quot; said Mr. Pratt,
  laughing, whom you must often have heard me mention.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;And pray, Mr. Pratt,&quot; enquired
  another gentleman, &quot; who <I>is </I>Teigue.?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;That,&quot; he replied, &quot;is more
  than I can tell. No one has ever been able to catch even a glimpse of him. I
  have been on the watch for a whole evening with three of my sons, yet,
  although his voice sometimes sounded almost in my ear, I could not see him. I
  fancied, indeed, that I saw a man in a white frieze jacket pass into the door
  from the garden to the lawn, but it could be only fancy, for I found the door
  locked, while the fellow, whoever he is, was laughing at our trouble. He
  visits us occasionally, and sometimes a long interval passes between his
  visits, as in the present case; it is now nearly two years since we heard that
  hollow voice outside the window. He has never done any injury that we know of;
  and once when he broke a plate, he brought one back exactly like it.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;It is very extraordinary,&quot; said
  several of the company.</P>

  <P>
&quot;But,&quot; remarked a gentleman to
  young Mr. Pratt, &quot;your father said he broke a plate; how did he get it
  without your seeing him?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;When he asks for some dinner, we put
  it outside the window and go away; whilst we watch he will not take it, but no
  sooner have we withdrawn than it is gone.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;How does he know that you are
  watching?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;That's more than I can tell, but he
  either knows or suspects. One day my brothers Robert and James with myself
  were in our back parlour, which has a window into the garden, when he came
  outside and said, 'Ho, ho, ho ! master James, and Robert, and Henry, give poor
  Teigue a glass of whiskey.' James went out of the room, filled a glass with
  whiskey, vinegar, and salt, and brought it to him. ' Here, Teigue,' said he,
  come for it now.' 'Well, put it down, then, on the step outside the window.'
  This was done, and we stood looking at it. 'There, now, go away,' he shouted.
  We retired, but still watched it. ' Ho, ho ! you are watching Teigue; go out
  of the room, now, or I won't take it.' We went outside the door and returned,
  the glass was gone, and a moment after we heard him roaring and cursing
  frightfully. He took away the glass, but the next day the glass was on the
  stone step under the window, and there were crumbs of bread in the inside, as
  if he had put it in his pocket,; from that time he was not heard till
  to-day.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Oh,&quot; said the colonel, &quot;
  I'll get a sight of him; you are not used to these things; an old soldier has
  the best chance; and as I shall finish my dinner with this wing, I'll be ready
  for him when he speaks next. Mr. Bell, will you take a glass of wine with
  me?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho ! Mr. Bell,&quot; shouted
  Teigue. &quot; Ho, ho! Mr. Bell, you were a quaker long ago. Ho, ho ! Mr.
  Bell, you're a pretty boy; - a pretty quaker you were; and now you're no
  quaker, nor any thing else : - ho, ho ! Mr. Bell. And there's Mr. Parkes: to
  be sure, Mr. Parkes looks mighty fine to-day, with his powdered head, and his
  grand silk stockings, and his bran new rakish-red waistcoat. - And there's Mr.
  Cole, - did you ever see such a fellow? a pretty company you've brought
  together, Mr. Pratt: kiln-dried quakers, butter-buying buckeens from
  Mallow-lane, and a drinking exciseman from the Coal-quay, to meet the great
  thundering artillery-general that is come out of the Indies, and is the
  biggest dust of them all.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;You scoundrel !&quot; exclaimed the
  colonel: &quot;I'll make you show yourself;&quot; and snatching up his sword
  from a corner of the room, he sprang out of the window upon the lawn. In a
  moment a shout of laughter, so hollow, so unlike any human sound, made him
  stop, as well as Mr. Bell, who with a huge oak stick was close at the
  colonel's heels; others of the party followed on the lawn, and the remainder
  rose and went to the windows.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Come on, colonel,&quot; said Mr.
  Bell; &quot;let us catch this impudent rascal.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho! Mr. Bell, here I am - here's
  Teigue - why don't you catch him? - Ho, ho! colonel Pratt, what a pretty
  soldier you are to draw your sword upon poor Teigue, that never did any body
  harm.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Let us see your face, you
  scoundrel,&quot; said the colonel.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho, ho ! - look at me - look at
  me: do you see the wind, colonel Pratt? - you'll see Teigue as soon; so go in
  and finish your dinner.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;If you're upon the earth I'll find
  you, you villain !&quot; said the colonel, whilst the same unearthly shout of
  derision seemed to come from behind an angle of the building. &quot;He's round
  that corner,&quot; said Mr. Bell - &quot; run, run.&quot;</P>

  <P>
They followed the sound, which was
  continued at intervals along the garden wall, but could discover no human
  being; at last both stopped to draw breath, and in an instant, almost at their
  ears, sounded the shout.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho, ho ! colonel Pratt, do you
  see Teigue now ? - do you hear him ? - Ho, ho, ho ! you're a fine colonel to
  follow the wind.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Not that way, Mr. Bell - not that
  way; come here,&quot; said the colonel.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho, ho ! what a fool you are; do
  you think Teigue is going to show himself to you in the field, there? But,
  colonel, follow me if you can : - you a soldier ! - ho, ho, ho !&quot; The
  colonel was enraged - he followed the voice over hedge and ditch, alternately
  laughed at and taunted by the unseen object of his pursuit - (Mr. Bell, who
  was heavy, was soon thrown out), until at length, after being led a weary
  chase, he found him self at the top of the cliff over that part of the river
  Lee which, from its great depth, and the blackness of its water, has received
  the name of Hell-hole. Here, on the edge of the cliff, stood the colonel out
  of breath, and mopping his forehead with his handkerchief; while the voice,
  which seemed close at his feet, exclaimed -&quot; Now, colonel Pratt - now, if
  you 're a soldier, here's a leap for you; - now look at Teigue - why don't you
  look at him? - Ho, ho, ho! Come along: you're warm, I'm sure, colonel Pratt,
  so come in and cool yourself; Teigue is going to have a swim !&quot; The voice
  seemed as descending amongst the trailing ivy and brushwood which clothes this
  picturesque cliff nearly from top to bottom, yet it was impossible that any
  human being could have found footing. &quot;Now, colonel, have you courage to
  take the leap? - Ho, ho, ho ! what a pretty soldier you are. Good-by - I'll
  see you again in ten minutes above, at the house - look at your watch colonel:
  - there's a dive for you;&quot; and a heavy plunge into the water was heard.
  The colonel stood still, but no sound followed, and he walked slowly back to
  the house, not quite half a mile from the Crag.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Well, did you see Teigue?&quot; said
  his brother, whilst his nephews, scarcely able to smother their laughter,
  stood by.&quot; Give me some wine,&quot; said the colonel. &quot; I never was
  led such a dance in my life: the fellow carried me all round and round, till
  he brought me to the edge of the cliff', and then down he went into Hell-hole,
  telling me he'd be here in ten minutes; 'tis more than that now, but he's not
  come.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho, ho! colonel, is'nt he here? -
  Teigue never told a lie in his life: but, Mr. Pratt, give me a drink and my
  dinner, and then good night to you all, for I'm tired; and that's the
  colonel's doing.&quot; A plate of food was ordered: it was placed by John,
  with fear and trembling, on the lawn under the window. Every one kept on the
  watch, and the plate remained undisturbed for some time.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ah! Mr. Pratt, will you starve poor
  Teigue? Make every one go away from the windows, and master Henry out of<I> </I>the
  tree, and master Richard off the garden wall.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The eyes of the company were turned to the
  tree and the garden wall; the two boys' attention was occupied in getting
  down: the visitors were looking at them; and &quot;Ho, ho, ho! - good luck to
  you, Mr. Pratt! - 'tis a good dinner, and there's the plate, ladies and
  gentlemen - good bye to you, colonel - good-bye, Mr. Bell ! - good-bye to you
  all &quot; - brought their attention back, when they saw the empty plate lying
  on the grass; and Teigue's voice was heard no more for that evening. Many
  visits were afterwards paid by Teigue; but never was he seen, nor was any
  discovery ever made of his person or character.</P>
