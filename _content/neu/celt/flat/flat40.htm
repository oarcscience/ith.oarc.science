<CENTER><H1>Dreaming Tim Jarvis</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
TIMOTHY JARVIS was a decent, honest, quiet,
  hard-working man, as every body knows that knows Balledehob.</P>

  <P>
Now Balledehob is a small place, about
  forty miles west of Cork. It is situated on the summit of a hill, and yet it
  is in a deep valley; for on all sides there are lofty mountains that rise one
  above another in barren grandeur, and seem to look down with scorn upon the
  little busy village which they surround with their idle and unproductive
  magnificence. Man and beast have alike deserted them to the dominion of the
  eagle, who soars majestically over them. On the highest of these mountains
  there is a small, and as is commonly believed, unfathomable lake, the only
  inhabitant of which is a huge serpent, who bas been sometimes seen to stretch
  its enormous head above the waters, and frequently is heard to utter a noise
  which shakes the very rocks to their foundation.</P>

  <P>
But, as I was saying, every body knew Tim
  Jarvis to be a decent, honest, quiet, hard-working man, who was thriving
  enough to be able to give his daughter Nelly a fortune of ten pounds; and Tim
  himself would have been snug enough besides, but that he loved the drop
  sometimes. However, he was seldom backward on rent day. His ground was never
  distrained but twice, and both times through a small bit of a mistake; and his
  landlord had never but once to say to him -Tim Jarvis, you 're all behind,
  Tim, like the cow's tail.&quot; Now it so happened that, being heavy in
  himself, through the drink, Tim took to sleeping, and the sleep set Tim
  dreaming, and he dreamed all night, and night after night, about crocks full
  of gold and other precious stones; so much so, that Norah Jarvis his wife
  could get no good of him by day, and have little comfort with him by night.
  The grey dawn of the morning would see Tim digging away in a bog-hole, maybe,
  or rooting under some old stone walls like a pig. At last he dreamt that he
  found a mighty great crock of gold and silver - and where do you think ? Every
  step of the way upon London-bridge, itself! Twice Tim dreamt it, and three
  times Tim dreamt the same thing; and at last he made up his mind to transport
  himself, and go over to London, in Pat Mahoney's coaster - and so he did !</P>

  <P>
Well, be got there, and found the bridge
  without much difficulty. Every day be walked up and down looking for the crock
  of gold, but never the find did he find it. One day, however, as he was
  looking over the bridge into the water, a man, or something like a man, with
  great black whiskers, like a Hessian, and a black cloak that reached down to
  the ground, taps him on the shoulder, and says he -&quot;Tim Jarvis, do you
  see me?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Surely I do, sir,&quot; said Tim;
  wondering that any body should know him in the strange place.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Tim,&quot; says be, &quot; what is it
  brings you here in foreign parts, so far away from your. own cabin by the mine
  of grey copper at Balledehob?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Please your honour,&quot; says Tim,
  &quot; I'm come to seek my fortune.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;You 're a fool for your pains, Tim,
  if that's all,&quot; remarked the stranger in the black cloak; this is a big
  place to seek one's fortune in, to be sure, but it's not so easy to find
  it.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Now, Tim, after debating a long time with
  himself, and considering, in the first place, that it might be the stranger
  who was to find the crock of gold for him and in the next, that the stranger
  might direct him where to find it,. came to the resolution of telling him all.</P>

  <P>
&quot;There's many a one like me comes here
  seeking their fortunes, said Tim.</P>

  <P>
&quot;True,&quot; said the stranger.</P>

  <P>
&quot;But,&quot; continued Tim, looking up,
  &quot;the body and bones of the cause for myself leaving the woman, and Nelly,
  and the boys, and. travelling so far, is to look for a crock of gold that I'm
  told is lying somewhere hereabouts.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;And who told you that Tim?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Why then, sir, that's what I can't
  tell myself rightly - only I dreamt it.&quot;.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ho, ho is that all, Tim!&quot; said
  the stranger laughing; &quot;I had a dream myself; and I dreamed that I found
  a crock of gold, in the Fort field, on Jerry Driscoll's ground at Balledehob;
  and by the same token, the pit where it lay was close to a large furze bush,
  all full of yellow blossom.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Tim knew Jerry Driscoll's ground well; and,
  moreover, he knew the Fort field as well as he knew his own potato garden; he
  was certain, too, of the very furze bush at the north end of it - so, swearing
  a bitter big oath, says he -</P>

  <P>
&quot;By all the crosses in a yard of
  check, I always thought there was money in that same field!&quot;</P>

  <P>
The moment he rapped out the oath the
  stranger disappeared, and Tim Jarvis, wondering at all that had happened to
  him, made the best of his way back to Ireland. Norah, as may well be supposed,
  had no very warm welcome for her runaway husband - the dreaming blackguard, as
  she called him - and so soon as she set eyes upon him, all the blood of her
  body in one minute was into her knuckles to be at him; but Tim, after his long
  journey, looked so cheerful and so happy-like, that she could not find it in
  her heart to give him the first blow ! He managed to pacify his wife by two or
  three broad hints about a new cloak and a pair of shoes, that, to speak
  honestly, were much wanting for her to go to chapel in; and decent clothes for
  Nelly to go to the patron with her sweetheart, and brogues for the boys, and
  some corduroy for himself. &quot;It wasn't for nothing,&quot; says Tim, &quot;
  I went to foreign parts all the ways; and you'll see what'll come out of it -
  mind my words.&quot;</P>

  <P>
A few days afterwards Tim sold his cabin
  and his garden, and bought the fort field of Jerry Driscoll, that had nothing
  in it, but was full of thistles, and old stones, and blackberry bushes; and
  all the neighbours - as well they might - thought he was cracked !</P>

  <P>
The first night that Tim could summon
  courage to begin his work, he walked off to the field with his spade upon his
  shoulder; and away he dug all night by the side of the furze. bush, till he
  came to a big stone. He struck his spade against it, and he heard a hollow
  sound; but as the morning had begun to dawn, and the neighbours would be going
  out to their work, Tim, not wishing to have the thing talked about, went home
  to the little hovel, where Norah and the children were huddled together under
  a heap of straw; for he had sold every thing he had in the world to purchase
  Driscoll's field, though it was said to be &quot;the back-bone of the world,
  picked by the devil.&quot;</P>

  <P>
It is impossible. to describe the epithets
  and reproaches bestowed by the poor woman on her unlucky husband for bringing
  her into such a way. Epithets and reproaches which Tim had but one mode of
  answering, as thus:.-&quot; Norah, did you see e'er a cow you'd like ?&quot; -
  or, &quot;Norah, dear, hasn't Poll Deasy a feather-bed to sell ?&quot; - or,
  &quot;Norah, honey, wouldn't you like your silver buckles as big as Mrs.
  Doyle's?&quot;</P>

  <P>
As soon as night, came Tim stood beside the
  furze bush, spade in hand. The moment he jumped down into the pit he heard a
  strange rumbling noise under him, and so, putting his ear against the great
  stone, he listened, and overheard a discourse that made the hair on his head
  stand up like bulrushes, and every limb tremble.</P>

  <P>
&quot;How shall we bother Tim ?&quot; said
  one voice.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Take him to the mountain, to be sure,
  and make him a toothful for the <I>ould sarpint; </I>'t is long since he has
  had a good meal,&quot; said another voice.</P>

  <P>
Tim shook like a potato-blossom in a storm.</P>

  <P>
&quot;No,&quot; said a third voice; &quot;
  plunge him in the bog, neck and heels.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Tim was a dead man, barring the breath<BR>

  [&quot;I' non mori, e non rimasi vivo :<BR>

  Pensa oramai per te, s' hai fior d' ingegno<BR>

  Qual io divenni d'uno e d' altro privo.&quot;<BR>

  Dante, Inferno, canto 34.]</P>

  <P>
&quot;Stop !&quot; said a fourth; but Tim
  heard no more, for Tim was dead entirely. In about an hour, however, the life
  came back into him, and he crept home to Norah.</P>

  <P>
When the next night arrived, the hopes of
  the crock of gold got the better of his fears, and taking care to arm himself
  with a bottle of potheen, away he went to the field. Jumping into the pit, he
  took a little sup from the bottle to keep his heart up - he then took a big
  one - and then with desperate wrench, he wrenched up the stone. All at once,
  up rushed a blast of wind, wild and fierce, and down fell Tim - down, down,
  and down he went - until he thumped upon what seemed to be, for all the world,
  like a floor of sharp pins, which made him bellow out in earnest. Then he
  heard a whisk and a hurra, and instantly voices beyond number cried out -</P>

  <P>
&quot;Welcome, Tim Jarvis, dear! Welcome,
  down here !&quot;</P>

  <P>
Though Tim's teeth chattered like magpies
  with the fright, he continued to make answer - &quot;I'm he-he-har-ti-ly
  ob-ob-liged to-to you all, gen-gentlemen, fo-for your civility to-to a poor
  stranger like myself.&quot; But though he had heard all the voices about him,
  he could see nothing, the place was so dark and so lonesome in itself for want
  of the light. Then something pulled Tim by the hair of his head, and dragged
  him, he did not know how far, but he knew he was going faster than the wind,
  for he heard it behind him, trying to keep up with him, and it could not. On,
  on, on, he went, till all at once, and suddenly, he was stopped, and somebody
  came up to him, and said, &quot;Well, Tim Jarvis, and how do you like your
  ride?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Mighty well ! I thank your
  honour,&quot; said Tim; &quot;and 'twas a good beast I rode, surely!&quot;</P>

  <P>
There was a great laugh at Tim's answer;
  and then there was a whispering, and a great cugger mugger, and coshering; and
  at last a pretty little bit of a voice said, &quot; Shut your eyes, and you'll
  see, Tim.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;By my word, then,&quot; said Tim,
  &quot;that is the queer way of seeing; but I'm not the man to gainsay you, so
  I'll do as you bid me, any how.&quot; Presently he felt a small warm hand
  rubbed over his<I> </I>eyes with an ointment, and in the next minute he saw
  himself in the middle of thousands of little men and women, not half so high
  as his brogue, that were pelting one another with golden guineas and
  lily-white thirteens [An English shilling was thirteen pence, Irish currency],
  as if they were so much dirt. The finest dressed and the biggest of them all
  went up to Tim, and says he, &quot; Tim Jarvis, because you are a decent,
  honest, quiet, civil, well-spoken man,&quot; says he, &quot;and know how to
  behave yourself in strange company? we've altered our minds about you, and
  will find a neighbour of yours that will do just as well to give to the old
  serpent.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Oh, then, long life to you, sir
  !&quot; said Tim, &quot;and there's no doubt of that.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;But what will you say, Tim,&quot;
  enquired the little fellow, &quot;if we fill your pockets with these yellow
  boys? What will you say, Tim, and what will you do with them?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Your honour's honour, and your
  honour's glory,&quot; answered Tim, &quot;I'll not be able to say my prayers
  for one month with thanking you - and indeed I've enough to do with them. I'd
  make a grand lady, you see, at once of Norah -she has been a good wife to me.
  We'll have a nice bit of pork for dinner; and, maybe, I'd have a glass, or
  maybe two glasses; or sometimes, if 'twas with a friend, or acquaintance, or
  gossip, you know, three glasses every day; and I'd build a new cabin; and I'd
  have a fresh egg every morning, myself, for my breakfast; and I'd snap my
  fingers at the 'squire, and beat his hounds, if they'd come coursing through
  my fields; and I'd have a new plough; and Norah, your honour, would have a new
  cloak, and the boys would have shoes and stockings as well as Biddy Leary's
  brats - that's my sister what was- and Nelly would marry Bill Long of
  Affadown; and, your honour, I'd have some corduroy for myself to make
  breeches, and a cow, and a beautiful coat with shining buttons, and a horse to
  ride, or may-be two. I 'd have every thing,&quot; said Tim, &quot;in life,
  good or bad, that is to be got for love or money - hurra-whoop ! and that's
  what I 'd do.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Take care, Tim,&quot; said the little
  fellow, &quot; your money would not go faster than it came, with your
  hurra-whoop.&quot;</P>

  <P>
But Tim heeded not this speech: heaps of
  gold were around him, and he filled and filled away as hard he could, his coat
  and his waistcoat and his breeches pockets; and he thought himself very
  clever, moreover, because he stuffed some of the guineas into his brogues.
  When the little people perceived this, they cried out - &quot;Go home, Tim
  Jarvis, go home, and think yourself a lucky man.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I hope, gentlemen,&quot; said he,
  &quot;we won't part for good and all; but may-be ye'll ask me to see you
  again, and to give you a fair and square account of what I've done with your'
  money.&quot;</P>

  <P>
To this there was no answer, only another
  shout - &quot;Go home, Tim Jarvis - go home - fair play is a jewel; but shut
  your eyes, or ye 'II never see the' light of day again.&quot;'</P>

  <P>
Tim shut his eyes, knowing now that was the
  way to see clearly; and away he was whisked as before - away, away he went
  till he again stopped all of a sudden.</P>

  <P>
He rubbed his eyes with his two thumbs -and
  where was he? Where, but in the very pit in the field that was Jer Driscoll's,
  and his wife Norah above with a big stick ready to beat &quot;her dreaming
  blackguard.&quot; Tim roared out to the woman to leave the life in him, and
  put his hands in his pockets to show her the gold; but he pulled out nothing
  only a handful of small stones mixed with yellow furze blossoms. The bush was
  under him, and the great flag-stone that lie had wrenched up<B>, </B>as he
  thought, was lying, as if it was never stirred, by his side: the whiskey
  bottle was drained to the last drop; and the pit was just as his spade had
  made it.</P>

  <P>
Tim Jarvis, vexed, disappointed, and almost
  heart-broken, followed his wife home: and, strange to say, from that night he
  left off drinking, and dreaming, and delving in bog-holes, and rooting in old
  caves. He took again to his hard working habits, and was soon able to buy back
  his little cabin and former potato garden, and to get all the enjoyment he
  anticipated from the fairy gold.</P>

  <P>
Give Tim one or, at most, two glasses of
  whiskey punch (and neither friend, acquaintance, nor gossip can make him take
  more), and he will relate the story to you much better than you have it here.
  Indeed, it is worth going to Balledehob to hear him tell it. He always pledges
  himself to the truth of every word with his fore-fingers crossed; and when he
  comes to speak of the loss of his guineas, he never fails to console himself
  by adding - &quot; If they stayed with me I wouldn't have luck with them, sir;
  and father O'Shea told me 'twas as well for me they were changed, for if they
  hadn't, they 'd have burned holes in my pocket, and got out that way.&quot;</P>

  <P>
I shall never forget his solemn
  countenance, and the deep tones of his warning voice, when he concluded his
  tale, by telling me, that the next day after his ride with the fairies, Mick
  Dowling was missing, and he believed him to be given to the <I>sarpint </I>in
  his place, as he had never been heard of since. &quot;The blessing of the
  saints be between all good men and harm,&quot; was the concluding sentence of
  Tim Jarvis's narrative, as he flung the remaining drops from his glass upon
  the green sward.</P>
