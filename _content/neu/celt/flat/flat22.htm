<CENTER><H1>The Haunted Castle</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
THE Christmas of 1820 I had promised to spend at Island Bawn
  Horne, in the county Tipperary, and I arrived there from Dublin on the 18th of
  December: I was so tired with travelling, that for two days after I remained
  quietly by the fireside, reading Mr. Luttrell's exquisite <I>jeu d'esprit, </I>&quot;Advice
  to Julia.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The first person I met on venturing out was old Pierce Grace,
  the smith, one of whose sons always attends me on my shooting excursions:
  &quot; Welcome to these parts,&quot; said Pierce: &quot; I was waiting all day
  yesterday, expecting to see your honour.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I am obliged to you, Piercy;; I was with the
  mistress.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;So I heard, your honour, which made me delicate of
  asking to see you. John is ready to attend you, and he has taken count of a
  power of birds.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The following morning, gun in hand, I sallied forth on a
  ramble through the country, attended by old Pierce's son John. After some
  hours' walking, we got into that winding vale, through which the Curriheen
  flows, and beheld the castle of Ballinatotty, whose base it washes, in the
  distance.</P>


<P>
The castle is still in good preservation, and
was once a place of some strength. It was the residence of a powerful and
barbarous race, named O'Brian, who were the scourge and terror of the country.
Tradition has preserved the names of three of the family: Phelim <I>lauve
lauider </I>(with the strong hand), his son Morty <I>lauve ne fulle</I> (of the
bloody hand), and grandson Donough <I>gontrough na thaha</I> (without mercy in
the dark), whose atrocities threw the bloody deeds of his predecessors
completely into the shade. Of him it is related, that in an incursion on a
neighbouring chieftain's territories, he put all the men and children to the
sword; and having ordered the women to be half buried in the earth, he had them
torn in pieces by bloodhounds &quot; Just to frighten his enemies,&quot; added
my narrator. The deed, however, which drew down upon him the deepest execration
was the murder of his wife, <I>Aileen na gruig buie</I> (Ellen with the yellow
hair), celebrated throughout the country for her beauty and affability. She was
the daughter of O'Kennedy of Lisnabonney Castle, and refused an offer of
marriage made to her by Donough; being supported in her refusal by her brother
Brian Oge, <I>skeul roa more</I> (the persuasive speaking) she was allowed to
remain single by her father, and his death seemed to relieve her from the fear
of compulsion; but in less than a month after, Brian Oge was murdered by an
unknown hand; on which occasion Ellen composed that affecting and well-known
keen, <I>Thaw ma cree qeen bruitha le focth </I>(My heart is sick and heavy with
cold). As she returned from her brother's funeral, Donough waylaid the
procession: her attendants were slaughtered, and she was compelled to become his
wife. Ellen ultimately perished by his hand, being, it is said, thrown out of
the bower window for having charged him with the murder of her brother. The spot
where she fell is shown; and on the anniversary of her death (the second Tuesday
in August) her spirit is believed to visit it.</P>


<P>
Giving John my gun, I proceeded to examine the castle: a window
on the south side is pointed out as the one from which Ellen was precipitated;
but it appears more probable that it was from the battlement over it, because
from the circumstance of there being corresponding holes in the masonry above
and below, it is evident that the iron-work must have been let in at the time of
building, and that it did not open.</P>

<P>
Having satisfied my curiosity, I was about to quit the room,
when observing an opening in the south-east corner, I was tempted&nbsp; to
explore it, and found a small staircase, which led to a sleeping recess. This
recess was occupied by a terrier and a litter of whelps. Enraged at my
intrusion, the dam attacked me, and having no means of defence, I made a hasty
retreat. How far the angry animal pursued me, I cannot say; for in my
precipitate flight, as I descended the second staircase, my foot slipped, and I
tumbled through a broad opening into what had probably been the guardroom: but
the evil I now encountered far exceeded that from which I fled, for the floor of
this room was in the last stage of decay: a cat could hardly have crossed it in
safety; and the violence with which I came on it carried me through its rotten
surface with as little opposition as I should have received from a spider's web,
and down I plunged into the gloomy depth beneath. A number of bats, whom my
sudden entrance disturbed, flapped their wings, and flitted round me.</P>

<P>
When my recollection returned, a confused sound of voices struck
my ears, and I then distinguished a female, who in a tone of the greatest
sweetness and tenderness said, &quot;It's not wanting - it's not wanting - the
life's coming into him.&quot; Opening my eyes, I found my head resting in the
lap of a peasant girl, about eighteen, who was chafing my temples. Health or
anxiety gave a glow to her mild and expressive features, and her light brown
hair was Simply parted on her forehead. On one side stood an old man, her
father, with a bunch of keys, and on the other knelt John Grace<I>, </I>with a
cup of whiskey, which she was applying to recover me. Looking round, I perceived
that we were on the rocks near the castle, and the river was flowing at our
feet. Various exclamations of joy followed; and the old man desiring John to
rinse the cup, insisted on my swallowing some of the <I>&quot;cratur,&quot; </I>which
having done and got up, I returned my thanks, and offered a small pecuniary
recompense, which they would not accept, &quot; For sure and certain they would
have gladly done <I>tin </I>times as much for his honour without fee or
reward.&quot;</P>

<P>
I then inquired how they came to find me. &quot;Why, as I
thought your honour,&quot; said John Grace, &quot; would be some time looking
into the crooks and corners of the place, I just walked round to talk to Honny
here; and so we were talking over matters, and Honny was just saying to me that
the boys (meaning her brothers) were just baling the streams, and had got a can
of large eels, and that if I thought the mistress would like them, I could take
as many as I pleased, and welcome, when we heard a great crash of a noise. '
What's that ?' says I. 'I suppose,' says Honny, ''tis the <I>ould</I> gray horse
that has fallen down and is <I>kilt</I> or may be it's Paddy's Spanish dog <I>Sagur
</I>that 's coursing about : there 's no thinking the plague he gives me -
they're both in the turf-house, fornent us (meaning, your honour, the underpart
of the castle that Cromwell made a breach into, and beside which the cabin
stands).</P>

<P>
&quot;In comes Tim Hagerty there, and then we heard a screech !
''Tis his honour's voice, says I; 'he has fallen through the flooring!' 'Oh! if
he has,' says Tim, 'I'm lost and undone for ever: and didn't the Squire no later
than last Monday week bid me build up the passage, or that somebody he said
would be <I>kilt - and </I>sure I meant to do it tomorrow.' Well, your honour,
we got a light, and we saw the Phookas that caused your fall all flying about,
in the shape of bats, and there we found your honour, and the turf all over the
place; and for sure and certain, if you hadn't first come on it, instead of the
bones that Paddy and Mick have been gathering against the young master's
wedding, you would have been smashed entirely. All of us were mad and distracted
about the wicked Phookas that were in the place, and could not tell what to do;
but Honny said to bring you out into the open air; and so we did; and there,
your honour, by care and management, praise be to God, we brought you round
again; but it was a desperate long time first, and myself thought it was as good
as all over with you.&quot;</P>

<P>
The reader, it is to he hoped, will not he able to form a
perfect notion of the Phooka; for indistinctness, like that of an imperfectly
remembered dream, seems to constitute its character, and yet Irish superstition
makes the Phooka palpable to the touch. To its agency the peasantry usually
ascribe accidental falls; and hence many rocky pits and caverns are called Poula
Phooka, or the hole of the Phooka. A waterfall of this name, formed by the
Liffey, is enumerated among &quot;the sights&quot; of the county Wicklow.</P>

<P>
An odd notion connected with the Phooka is, that the country
people will tell their children after Michaelmas day not to eat blackberries,
and they attribute the decay in them, which about that time commences, to the
operation of the Phooka.</P>
