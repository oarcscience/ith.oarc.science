  <P>
THE Reverend Charles Bunworth was rector of Buttevant, in the
  county of Cork, about the middle of the last century. He was a man of
  unaffected piety, and of sound learning; pure in heart, and benevolent in
  intention. By the rich he was respected, and by the poor beloved; nor did a
  difference of creed prevent their looking up to .&quot; <I>the minister</I>
  &quot;(so was Mr. Bunworth called by them) in matters of difficulty and in
  seasons of distress, confident of receiving from him the advice and assistance
  that a father would afford to his children. He was the friend and' the
  benefactor of the surrounding country - to him, from the neighbouring town of
  Newmarket, came both Curran and Yelverton for advice and instruction, previous
  to their entrance at Dublin College. Young, indigent and inexperienced, these
  afterwards eminent men received from him, in addition to the advice they
  sought, pecuniary aid; and the brilliant career which was theirs, justified
  the discrimination of the giver.</P>

  <P>
But what extended the fame of Mr. Bunworth far beyond the
  limits of the parishes adjacent to his own, was his performance on the Irish
  harp, and his hospitable reception and entertainment of the poor harpers who
  travelled from house to house about the country. Grateful to their patron,
  these itinerant minstrels sang his praises to the tingling accompaniment of
  their harps, invoking in return for his bounty abundant blessings on his white
  head, and celebrating in their rude verses the blooming charms of his
  daughters, Elizabeth and Mary. It was all these poor fellows could do; but who
  can doubt that their gratitude was sincere, when, at the time of Mr.
  Bunworth's death, no less than fifteen harps were deposited on the loft of his
  granary, bequeathed to him by the last members of a race which has now ceased
  to exist, Trifling, no doubt, in intrinsic value were these relics, yet there
  is something in gifts of the heart that merits preservation; and it is to be
  regretted that, when he died, these harps were broken up one after the other,
  and used as fire-wood by an ignorant follower of the family, who, on their
  remove to Cork for a temporary change of scene; was left in charge of the
  house.</P>

  <P>
The circumstances attending the death of Mr. Bunworth may be
  doubted by some; but there are still living credible witnesses who declare
  their authenticity, and who can be produced to attest most, if not all of the
  following particulars.</P>

  <P>
About a week previous to his dissolution, and early in the
  evening, a noise was heard at the hall-door resembling the shearing of sheep;
  but at the time no particular attention was paid to it. It was nearly eleven
  o'clock the same night, when Kavanagh, the herdsman, returned from Mallow,
  whither he had been sent in the afternoon for some medicine, and was observed
  by Miss Bunworth, to whom he delivered the parcel, to be much agitated. At
  this time, it must be observed, her father was by no means considered in
  danger.</P>

  <P>
&quot;What is the matter, Kavanagh?&quot; asked Miss Bunworth:
  but the poor fellow, with a bewildered look, only uttered, &quot;The master,
  Miss - the master - he is going from us;&quot; and, overcome with real grief,
  he burst into a flood of tears.</P>

  <P>
Miss Bunworth, who was a woman of strong nerve, enquired if
  any thing he bad learned in Mallow induced him to suppose that her' father was
  worse.</P>

  <P>
&quot; No, Miss,&quot; said Kavanagh; &quot;it was not in
  Mallow -&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Kavanagh,&quot; said Miss Bunworth, with that
  stateliness of manner for which she is said to have been remarkable, &quot;I
  fear you have been drinking, which, I must say, I did not expect at such a
  time as the present, when it was your duty to have kept yourself sober ; - I
  thought you might have been trusted: - what should we have done if you had
  broken the medicine. bottle, or lost it? for the doctor said it was of the
  greatest consequence that your master should take the medicine to-night. But I
  will speak to you in the morning, when you are in a fitter state to
  under-stand what I say.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Kavanagh looked up with a stupidity of aspect which did not
  serve to remove the impression of his being drunk, as his eyes appeared heavy
  and dull after the flood of tears - but his voice was not that of an
  intoxicated person.</P>

  <P>
Miss,&quot; said he,&quot; as I hope to receive mercy
  hereafter, neither bit nor sup has passed my lips since I left this house: but
  the master ----&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Speak softly,&quot; said Miss Bunworth; &quot;he sleeps,
  and is going on as well as we could expect.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Praise be to God for that, any way,&quot; replied Kavanagh;
  &quot; but oh! Miss, he is going from us surely - we will lose him-the master
  - we will lose him, we will lose him!&quot; and he wrung his hands together.</P>

  <P>
&quot;What is it you mean, Kavanagh?&quot; asked Miss
  Bunworth.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Is it mean?&quot; said Kavanagh: &quot;the Banshee has
  come for him, Miss; and 'tis not I alone who have heard her.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot; 'Tis an idle superstition,&quot; said Miss Bunworth.</P>

  <P>
&quot;May be so,&quot; replied Kavanagh, as if the words idle
  superstition only sounded upon his ear without reaching his mind - &quot;May
  be so,&quot; he continued; &quot;but as I came through the glen of Ballybeg,
  she was along with me keening, and screeching, and clapping her hands, by my
  side, every step of the way, with her long white hair failing about her
  shoulders, and I could hear her repeat the master's name every now and then,
  as plain as ever I heard it. When I came to the old abbey, she parted from me
  there, and turned into the pigeon-field next the <I>berrin</I><I>
  </I>ground, and folding her cloak about her, down
  she sat under the tree that was struck by the lightning, and began keening so
  bitterly, that it went through one's heart to hear it.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot; Kavanagh,&quot; said Miss Bunworth, who had, however,
  listened attentively to this remarkable relation, &quot; my father is, I
  believe, better; and I hope will himself soon be up and able to convince you
  that all this is but your own fancy; nevertheless, I charge you not to mention
  what you have told me, for there is no occasion to frighten your fellow
  servants with the story.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Mr. Bunworth gradually declined; but nothing particular
  occurred until the night previous to his death: that night both his daughters,
  exhausted with continued attendance and watching, were prevailed upon to seek
  some repose; and an elderly lady, a near relative and friend of the family,
  remained by the bedside of their father. The old gentleman then lay in the
  parlour, where he had been in the morning removed at his own request, fancying
  the change would afford him relief; and the head of his bed was placed close
  to the window. In a room adjoining sat some male friends, and, as usual on
  like occasions of illness, in the kitchen many of the followers of the family
  had assembled.</P>

  <P>
The night was serene and moonlight-the sick man slept - and
  nothing broke the stillness of their melancholy watch, when the little party
  in the room adjoining the parlour, the door of which stood open, was suddenly
  roused by a sound. at the window near the bed: a rose-tree grew out-side the
  window, so close as to touch the glass; this was forced aside with some noise,
  and a low moaning was heard, accompanied by clapping. of hands, as if of a
  female in deep affliction. It seemed as if the sound proceeded from a person
  holding her mouth close to the window. The lady who sat by the bedside of Mr.
  Bunworth went into the adjoining room, and in the tone of alarm, enquired of
  the gentlemen there, if they had heard the Banshee? Sceptical of super natural
  appearances, two of them rose hastily and went out to discover the cause of
  these sounds, which they also had distinctly heard. They walked all round the
  house, examining every spot of ground, particularly near the window from the
  voice had proceeded; the bed of earth beneath, in which the rose tree was
  planted, had been recently dug, and the print of a footstep - if the tree had
  been forced aside by mortal hand - would have inevitably remained; but they
  could perceive no such impression; and an unbroken stillness reigned without.
  Hoping to dispel the mystery, they continued their search anxiously along the
  road, from the straightness of which and the' lightness of the night, 'they
  were enabled to see some distance around them; but all was silent and
  deserted, and they returned surprised and disappointed. How much more then
  were 'they astonished at learning that the whole time of their absence, those
  who remained within the house had heard the moaning and clapping of hands even
  louder and more distinct than before they had gone out; and no sooner was the
  door of the room closed on them, than they again heard the same mournful
  sounds! Every succeeding hour the sick man became worse, and as the first
  glimpse of the morning appeared, Mr. Bunworth expired.</P>
