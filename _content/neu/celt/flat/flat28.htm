<CENTER><H1>The Lady of Gollerus</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
ON the shore of Smerwick harbour, one fine summer's morning,
  just at day-break, stood Dick Fitzgerald &quot;shoghing the dudeen,&quot;
  which may be translated, smoking his pipe. The sun was gradually rising behind
  the lofty Brandon, the dark sea was getting green in the light, and the mists
  clearing away out of the valleys went rolling and curling like the smoke from
  the corner of Dick's mouth.</P>


<P>
&quot; 'Tis just the pattern of a pretty
morning,'. said Dick, taking the pipe from between his lips, and looking towards
the distant ocean, which lay as still and tranquil as a tomb of polished marble.
&quot;Well, to be sure, continued he, after a pause, &quot; 'tis mighty lonesome
to be talking to one's self by way of company, and not to have another soul to
answer one - nothing but the child of one's own voice, the echo ! I know this,
that if I had the luck, or may be the misfortune,&quot; said Dick with a
melancholy smile, &quot;to have the woman, it would not be this way with me -
and what in the wide world is a man without a wife? He's no more surely than a
bottle without a drop of drink in it, or dancing without music, or the left leg
of a scissars, or a fishing line without a hook, or any other matter that is no
ways complete. - Is it not so?&quot; said Dick Fitzgerald, casting his eyes
towards a rock upon the strand, which, though it could not speak, stood up as
firm and looked as bold as ever Kerry witness did.</P>


<P>
But what was his astonishment at beholding, just at the foot of
that rock, a beautiful young creature combing her hair, which was of a sea-green
colour; and now the salt water shining on it, appeared, in the morning light,
like melted butter upon cabbage.</P>

<P>
Dick guessed at once that she was a Merrow, although he had
never seen one before, for he spied the <I>cohuleen driuth, </I>or little
enchanted cap, which the sea people use for diving down into the ocean, lying
upon the strand, near her; and he had heard; that if once he could possess
himself of the cap, she would lose the power of' going away into the water so he
seized it with all speed; and she, hearing the noise, turned her head about as
natural as any Christian.</P>

<P>
When the Merrow saw that her little diving-cap was gone, the
salt tears - doubly salt, no doubt, from her - came trickling down her cheeks,
and she began a low mournful cry with just the tender voice of a new-born
infant. Dick, although he knew well enough what she was crying for, determined
to keep the <I>cohuleen</I> <I>driuth, </I>let her cry never so much, to see
what luck would come out of it. Yet he could not help pitying her and when the
dumb thing looked up in his face, and her cheeks all moist with tears, 't was
enough to make any one feel, let alone Dick, who had ever and always, like most
of his countrymen, a mighty tender heart of his own.</P>

<P>
&quot; 'Don't cry, my darling,&quot; said Dick Fitzgerald; but
the Merrow, like any bold child, only cried the more for that.</P>

<P>
Dick sat himself down by her side, and took hold of her band, by
way of comforting her. 'Twas in no particular an ugly hand, only there was a
small web between the fingers, as there is in a duck's foot; but 'twas as thin
and as white as the skin between egg and shell.</P>

<P>
&quot; What's your name, my darling?&quot; says Dick, thinking
to make her conversant with him; but he got no answer; and he was certain sure
now, either that she could not speak, or did not understand him : he therefore
squeezed her hand in his, as the only way he had of talking to her. It's the
universal language; and there's not a woman in the world, be she fish or lady,
that does not understand it.</P>

<P>
The Merrow did not seem much displeased at this mode of
conversation; and, making an end of her whining all at once &quot; Man,&quot;
says she, looking up in Dick Fitzgerald's face, &quot; Man, will you eat
me?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;By all the red petticoats and check aprons between Dingle
and Tralee,&quot; cried Dick jumping up in amazement, &quot;I'd as soon eat
myself, my jewel! Is it I eat you, my pet? -Now, 't was some ugly ill-looking
thief of a fish put that notion into your own pretty head, with the nice green
hair down upon it, that is so cleanly combed out this morning! &quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Man,&quot; said the Merrow, &quot; what will you do with
me, if you won't eat me?&quot;</P>

<P>
Dick's thoughts were running on a wife : he saw, at the first
glimpse, that she was handsome; but since she spoke, and spoke too like any real
woman, he was fairly in love with her. 'Twas the neat way she called him man,
that settled the matter entirely.</P>

<P>
&quot;Fish,&quot; says Dick, trying to speak to her after her
own short fashion; &quot; fish,&quot; says he, &quot; here's my word, fresh and
fasting, for you this blessed morning, that I'll make you mistress Fitzgerald
before all the world, and that's what I 'll do.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Never say the word twice.&quot; says she; &quot; I'm ready
and willing to be yours, mister Fitzgerald; but stop, if you please, 'till I
twist up my hair.&quot;</P>

<P>
It was some time before she had settled it entirely to her
liking for she guessed, I suppose, that she was going among strangers, where she
would be looked at. When that was done, the Merrow put the comb in her pocket,
and then bent down her head and whispered some words to the water that was close
to the foot of the rock.</P>

<P>
Dick saw the murmur of the words upon the top of the sea, going
out towards the wide ocean, just like a breath of wind rippling along, and, says
he, in the greatest wonder, &quot;Is it speaking you are, my darling, to the
salt water?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;It's nothing else,&quot; says she, quite carelessly,
&quot; I 'm just sending word home to my father, not to be waiting breakfast for
me ; just to keep him from being uneasy in his mind.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot; And<I> </I>who's your father, my duck?&quot; says Dick.</P>

<P>
&quot; What!&quot; said the Merrow, &quot; did you never hear of
my father? he's the king of the waves, to be sure!&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;And yourself, then, is a real king's daughter ?&quot; said
Dick, opening his two eyes to take a full and true survey of his wife that was
to be.</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh, I'm nothing else but a made man with you, and a king
your father; to be sure he has all the money that's down in the bottom of the
sea ! &quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Money,&quot; repeated the Merrow, &quot; what's
money?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot; 'Tis no bad thing to have when one wants it,&quot;
replied Dick; &quot;and may be now the fishes have the understanding to bring up
whatever you bid them?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh ! yes,&quot; said the Merrow, &quot;they bring me what
I want.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;To speak the truth,&quot; said Dick, &quot; 'tis a straw
bed I have at home before you, and that, I'm thinking, is no ways fitting for a
king's daughter: so if 't would not be displeasing to you, just to mention, a
nice feather bed, with a pair of new blankets - but what am I talking about? may
be you have not such things as beds down under the water?&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;By all means,&quot; said she, &quot; Mr. Fitzgerald -
plenty of beds at your service. I've fourteen oyster beds of my own, not to
mention one just planting for the rearing of young ones.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;You have,&quot; says Dick, scratching his head and looking
a little puzzled. &quot; 'T is a feather bed I was speaking of but clearly,
yours is the very cut of a decent plan, to have bed and supper so handy to each
other, that a person when they'd have the one, need never ask for the
other.&quot;</P>

<P>
However, bed or no bed, money or no money, Dick Fitzgerald
determined to marry the Merrow, and the Merrow had given her consent. Away they
went, therefore, across the strand, from Gollerus to Ballinrunnig, where Father
Fitzgibbon happened to be that morning.</P>

<P>
&quot;There are two words to this bargain, Dick
Fitzgerald,&quot; said his Reverence, looking mighty glum. &quot;And is it a
fishy woman you'd marry? - the Lord preserve us ! - Send the scaly creature home
to her own people, that's my advice to you, wherever she came from.&quot;</P>

<P>
Dick had the <I>cohuleen driuth </I>in his hand, and was about
to give it back to the Merrow, who looked covetously at it, but he thought for a
moment, and then, says he -</P>

<P>
&quot;Please your Reverence, she's a king's daughter.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;If she was the daughter of fifty kings,&quot; said Father
Fitzgibbon, &quot; I tell you, you can't marry her, she being a fish.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Please your Reverence,&quot; said Dick again, in an under
tone, &quot; she is as mild and as beautiful as the moon.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;If she was as mild and as beautiful as the sun, moon, and
stars, all put together, I tell you, Dick Fitzgerald,&quot; said the Priest,
stamping his right foot, &quot;you can 't marry her, she being a fish !</P>

<P>
&quot;But she has all the gold that's down in the sea only for
the asking, and I'm a made man if I marry her; and,&quot; said Dick, looking up
slyly, &quot; I can make it worth any one's while to do the job.&quot;</P>

<P>
&quot;Oh ! - that alters the case entirely,&quot; replied the
Priest; &quot;why there's some reason now in what you say: why didn't you tell
me this before ? - marry her by all means if she was ten times a fish. Money,
you know, is not to be refused in these bad times, and I may as well have the
hansel of it as another, that may be would not take half the pains in
counselling you as I have done.&quot;</P>

<P>
So Father Fitzgibbon married Dick Fitzgerald to the Merrow, and
like any loving couple, they returned to Gollerus well pleased with each other.
Every thing prospered with Dick - he was at the sunny side of the world; the
Merrow made the best of wives, and they lived together in the greatest
contentment.</P>

<P>
It was wonderful to see, considering where she had been brought
up, how she would busy herself about the house, and how well she nursed the
children; for, at the end of three years, there were as many young Fitzgeralds -
two boys and a girl.</P>

<P>
In short, Dick was a happy man, and so he might have continued
to the end of his days, if he had only the sense to take proper care of what he
had got; many another man, however, beside Dick, has not had wit enough to do
that.</P>

<P>
One day when Dick was obliged to go to Tralee, he left his wife,
minding the children at home after him, and thinking she had plenty to do
without disturbing his fishing tackle.</P>

<P>
Dick was no sooner gone than Mrs. Fitzgerald set about cleaning
up the house, and chancing to pull down a fishing net, what should she find
behind it in a hole in the wall but her own <I>cohullen driuth.</P>

</I>
<P>
She took it out and looked at it, and then she thought of her
father the king, and her mother the queen, and her brothers and sisters, and she
felt a longing to go back to them.</P>

<P>
She sat down on a little stool and thought over the happy days
she had spent under the sea; then she looked at her children, and thought on the
love and affection of poor Dick, and how it would break his heart to lose her.
&quot; But,&quot; says she, &quot;he won't lose me entirely, for I'll come back
to him again, and who can blame me for going to see my father and my mother
after being so long away from them.&quot;</P>

<P>
She got up and went towards the door, but came back again to
look once more at the child that was sleeping in the cradle. She kissed it
gently, and as she kissed it, a tear trembled for an instant in her eye and then
feIl on its rosy cheek. She wiped away the tear, and turning to the eldest
little girl, told her to take good care of her brothers, and to be a good child
herself, until she came back. The Merrow then went down to the strand. - The sea
was lying calm and smooth, just heaving and glittering in the sun, and she
thought she heard a faint sweet singing, inviting her to come down. All her old
ideas and feelings came flooding over her mind, Dick and her children were at
the instant forgotten, and placing the <I>cohuleen driuth </I>on her head, she
plunged in.</P>

<P>
Dick came home in the evening, and missing his wife, he asked
Kathelin, his little girl, what had become of her mother, but she could not tell
him. He then enquired of the neighbours, and he learned that she was seen going
towards the strand with a strange looking thing like a cocked hat in her hand.
He returned to his cabin to search for the <I>cohuleen driuth. </I>It was gone,
and the truth now flashed upon him.</P>

<P>
Year after year did Dick Fitzgerald wait, expecting the return
of his wife, but he never saw her more. Dick never married again, always
thinking that the Merrow would sooner or later return to him, and nothing could
ever persuade him but that her father the king kept her below by main force;
&quot; For,&quot; said Dick, &quot; she surely would not of herself give up her
husband and her children.&quot;</P>

<P>
While she was with him, she was so good a wife in every respect,
that to this day she is spoken of in the tradition of the country as the pattern
for one, under the name of THE LADY OF GOLLERUS.</P>
