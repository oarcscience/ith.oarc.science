  <P>
BILLY MAC DANIEL was once as likely a young man as ever shook
  his brogue at a patron, emptied a quart, or handled a shillelagh: fearing for
  nothing but the want of drink; caring for nothing but who should pay for it;
  and thinking of nothing but how to make fun over it: drunk or sober, a word
  and a blow was ever the way with Billy Mac Daniel; and a mighty easy way it is
  of either getting into or ending a dispute. More is the pity that, through the
  means of his drinking, and fearing, and caring for nothing, this same Billy
  Mac Daniel fell into bad company; for surely the good people are the worst of
  all company any one could come across.</P>

  <P>
It so happened that Billy was going home one clear frosty
  night not long after Christmas; the moon was round and bright; but although it
  was as fine a night as heart could wish for, he felt pinched with the cold.
  &quot;By my word,&quot; chattered Billy, &quot;a drop of good. liquor would be
  no bad thing to keep a man's soul from freezing in him; and I wish I had a
  full measure of the best.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Never wish it twice, Billy,&quot; said a little man in a
  three-cornered hat, bound all about with gold lace, and with great silver
  buckles in his shoes, so big that it was a wonder how he could carry them, and
  he held out a glass as big as himself, filled with as good liquor as ever eye
  looked on or lip tasted.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Success;. my little fellow,&quot; said Billy Mac Daniel,
  nothing daunted, though well he knew the little man to belong to the <I>good
  people; </I>&quot;here's your health, any way, and thank you kindly; no matter
  who pays for the drink;&quot; and he took the glass and drained it to the very
  bottom, without ever taking a second breath to it.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Success,&quot; said the little man; &quot;and you 're
  heartily welcome, Billy; but don't think to cheat me as you have done others,
  - out with your purse and pay me like a gentleman.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Is it I pay you?&quot; said Billy: &quot; could I not just take
  you up and put you in my pocket. as easily as a blackberry?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Billy Mac Daniel,&quot; said the little man, getting
  very angry, &quot;you shall be my servant for seven years and a day, and that
  is the way I will be paid; so make ready to follow me.&quot;</P>

  <P>
When Billy heard this, he began to be very sorry for having
  used such bold words towards the little man; and he felt himself, yet could
  not tell how, obliged to follow the little man the live-long night about the
  country, up and down, and over hedge and ditch, and through bog and brake,
  without any rest.</P>

  <P>
When morning began to dawn, the little man turned round to him
  and said, &quot;You may now go home, Billy, but on your peril don't fail to
  meet me in the Fort-field to-night; or if you do, it may be the worse for you
  in the long run. If I find you a good servant, you will find me an indulgent
  master.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Home Went Billy Mac Daniel; and though he was tired and weary
  enough, never a wink of sleep could he get for thinking of the little man; but
  he was afraid not to do his bidding, so up he got in the evening, and away he
  went to the Fort-field. He was not long there before the little man came
  towards him and said, &quot; Billy, I want to go a long journey to-night; so
  saddle one of my horses, and you may saddle another for your-self, as you are
  to go along with me, and may be tired after your walk last night.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Billy thought this very considerate of his master, and thanked
  him accordingly: &quot; But,&quot; said he, &quot; if I may be so bold, sir, I
  would ask which is the way to your stable, for never a thing do I see but the
  fort here, and the old thorn-tree in the corner of the field, and the stream
  running at the bottom of the hill, with the bit of bog over against us.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ask no questions, Billy,&quot; said the little man,
  &quot;but go over to that bit of bog, and bring me two of the strongest rushes
  you can find.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Billy did accordingly, wondering what the little man would be
  at; and he picked out two of the stoutest rushes he could find, with a little
  bunch of brown blossom stuck at the side of each, and brought them back to his
  master.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Get up, Billy,&quot; said the little man, taking one of
  the rushes from him and striding across it.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Where will I get up, please your honour?&quot; said
  Billy.</P>

  <P>
&quot; Why, upon horseback, like me, to be sure,&quot; said
  the little man.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Is it after making a fool of me you 'd be,&quot; said
  Billy, &quot;bidding me get a horse-back upon that bit of a rush? May be you
  want to persuade me that the rush I pulled but while ago out of the bog over
  there is a horse?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Up! up! and no words,&quot; said the little man, looking
  very vexed; &quot;the best horse you ever rode was but a fool to it.&quot; So
  Billy, thinking all this was in joke, and fearing to Vex his master, straddled
  across the rush : &quot;Borram! Borram! Borram !&quot; cried the little man
  three times (which, in English, means to become great), and Billy did the same
  after him: presently the rushes swelled up into fine horses, and away they
  went full speed; but Billy, who had put the rush between his legs, without
  much minding how he did it, found himself sitting on horseback the wrong way,
  which was rather awkward, with his face to the horse's tail; and so quickly
  had his steed started off with him, that he had no power to turn round, and
  there was therefore nothing for it but to hold on by the tail.</P>

  <P>
At last they came to their journey's end; and stopped at the
  gate of a fine house: &quot; Now, Billy,&quot; said the little man, &quot;do
  as you see me do, and follow me close; but as you did not know your horse's
  head from his tail, mind that your own head does not spin round until you
  can't tell whether you are standing on it or on your heels: for remember that
  old liquor, though able to make a cat speak, can make a man dumb.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The little man then said some queer kind of words, out of
  which Billy could make no meaning; but he contrived to say them after him for
  all that; and in they both went through the key-hole of the door, and through
  one key-hole after another, until they got into the wine-cellar, which was
  well stored with all kinds of wine.</P>

  <P>
The little man fell to drinking as hard as he could, and Billy
  noway disliking the example, did the same. &quot;The best of masters are you
  surely,&quot; said Billy to him; &quot; no matter who is the next; and well
  pleased will I be with your service if you continue to give me plenty to
  drink?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I have made no bargain with you,&quot; said the little
  man, &quot; and will make none; but up and follow me. Away they went, through
  key-hole after key-hole; and each mounting upon the rush which he bad left at
  the hall door, scampered off, kicking the clouds before them like snow-balls,
  as soon as the words, &quot; Borram, Borram, Borram,&quot; had passed their
  lips.</P>

  <P>
When they came back to the Fort-field,' the little man
  dismissed Billy, bidding him to be there the next night at the same hour. Thus
  did they go on, night after night, shaping their course one night here, and
  another night there-some-times north, and sometimes east, and sometimes south,
  until there was not a gentleman's wine-cellar in all Ireland they had not
  visited, and could tell the flavour of every wine in it as well - aye, better
  than the butler himself.</P>

  <P>
One night when Billy Mac Daniel met the little man as usual in
  the Fort-field, and was going to the bog to fetch the horses for their
  journey, his master said to him, &quot; Billy, I shall want another horse
  to-night, for may be we may bring back more company with us than we
  take.&quot;</P>

  <P>
So Billy, who now knew better than to question any order given
  to him by his master, brought a third rush, much wondering who it might be
  that would travel back in their company, and whether he was about to have. a
  fellow-servant. &quot;If I have, &quot; thought Billy, &quot;he shall go and
  fetch the horses from the bog every night; for I don't see why I am not, every
  inch of me, as good a gentleman as my master.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Well, away they went, Billy leading the third horse, and never
  stopped until they came to a snug farmer's house in the county Limerick, close
  under the old castle of Carrigogunniel, that was built, they say, by the great
  Brian Boru. Within. the house there was great carousing going forward, and the
  little man stopped outside for some time to listen; then turning round all of
  a sudden, said, &quot; Billy, I will be a thousand years old tomorrow!&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot; God bless us, sir,&quot; said Billy, &quot; will you
  I&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Don't say these words again; Billy,&quot; said the
  little man, &quot; or you will be my ruin for ever. Now, Billy, as I will be a
  thousand years in the world to-morrow, I think it is full time for me to get
  married.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;I think so too, without any kind of doubt at all,&quot;
  said Billy, &quot;if ever you mean to marry.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;And to that purpose,&quot; said the little man, have I
  come all the way to Carrigogunniel; for in this house, this very night, is
  young Darby Riley going to be married to Bridget Rooney; and as she is a tall
  and comely girl, and has come of decent people, I think of marrying her
  myself, and taking her off with me.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;And what will Darby Riley say to
  that?&quot; said Billy.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Silence!&quot; said the little man, putting on a mighty
  severe look: &quot; I did not bring you here with me to ask questions;&quot;
  and without holding further argument, he began saying the queer words which
  had the power of passing him through the key-hole as free as air, and which
  Billy thought himself mighty clever to be able to say after him.</P>

  <P>
In they both went; and for the better viewing the company, the
  little man perched himself up as nimbly as a cock-sparrow upon one of the big
  beams which went across the house over all their heads, and Billy did the same
  upon another facing him ; but not being much accustomed to roosting in such a
  place, his legs hung down as untidy as may be, and it was quite clear he had
  not taken pattern after the way in which the little man had bundled himself up
  together. If the little man had been a tailor all his life, he could not have
  sat more contentedly upon his haunches.</P>

  <P>
There they were, both master and man, looking down upon the
  fun that was going forward - and under them were the priest and piper - and
  the father of Darby Riley, with Darby's two brothers and his uncle's son - and
  there were both the father and the mother of Bridget Rooney, and. proud enough
  the old couple were that night of their daughter, as good right they had - and
  her four sisters with brand new ribands in their caps, and her three brothers
  all looking as clean and as clever as any three boys in Munster - and there
  were uncles and aunts, and gossips and cousins enough besides to make 'a full
  house of it - and plenty was there to eat and drink on the table for every one
  of them, if they had been double the number.</P>

  <P>
Now it happened, just as: Mrs. Rooney had helped his reverence
  to the first cut of the pig's head which was placed before her, beautifully
  bolstered up with white savoys, that the bride gave a sneeze which made every
  one at table start, but not a soul said &quot; God bless us.&quot; All
  thinking that the priest would have done so, as he ought. if he had done his
  duty, no one wished to. take the word out of his mouth, which unfortunately
  was pre-occupied with pig's head and greens. And after. a moment's pause, the
  fun and merriment of the bridal feast went on without the pious benediction.</P>

  <P>
Of this circumstance both Billy and his master were no
  inattentive spectators from their exalted stations. &quot; Ha !&quot;
  exclaimed the little man, throwing one leg from under him with a joyous
  flourish, and his eye twinkled with a strange light, whilst his eyebrows
  became elevated into the curvature of Gothic arches -&quot; Ha I&quot; said
  he, leering down at the bride, and then up at Billy, I have half of her now,
  surely.. Let her sneeze but twice more, and she is mine, in spite of priest,
  mass-book and Darby Riley.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Again the fair Bridget sneezed; but it was so gently, and she
  blushed so much, that few<I> </I>except the little man took, or seemed to
  take, any notice; and no one thought of saying &quot;God bless us.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Billy all this time regarded the poor girl with a most rueful
  expression of countenance; for he could not help thinking what a terrible
  thing it was for a nice young girl of nineteen, with large blue eyes,
  transparent skin, and dimpled cheeks, suffused with health and joy, to be
  obliged to marry an ugly little bit of a man who was a thousand years old,
  barring a day.</P>

  <P>
At this critical moment the bride gave a third sneeze, and
  Billy roared out with all his might, &quot;God save us !&quot; Whether this
  exclamation resulted from his soliloquy, or from the mere force of habit, he
  never could tell exactly himself; but no sooner was it uttered, than the
  little man, his face glowing with rage and disappointment, sprung from the
  beam on which he had perched himself; and shrieking out. in the shrill voice
  of a cracked bagpipe, &quot; I discharge you my service, Billy Mac Daniel -
  take <I>that</I> for your wages, gave poor Billy a most furious kick in the
  back, which sent his unfortunate servant sprawling upon his face and hands
  right in the middle of the supper table.</P>

  <P>
If Billy was astonished, how much more so was every one of the
  company into which he was thrown with so little ceremony; but when they heard
  his story, Father Cooney laid down his knife and fork, and married the young
  couple out of hand with all speed; and Billy Mac Daniel danced the Rinka at
  their wedding, and plenty did he drink at it too, which was what he thought
  more of than dancing.</P>
