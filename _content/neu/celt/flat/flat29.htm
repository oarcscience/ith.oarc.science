<CENTER><H1>Flory Cantillon's Funeral</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
THE ancient burial-place of the Cantillon family was on an
  island in Ballyheigh Bay. This island was situated at no great distance from
  the shore, and at a remote period was overflowed in one of the incroachments
  which the Atlantic has made on that part of the coast of Kerry. The fishermen
  declare they have often seen the ruined walls of an old chapel beneath them in
  the water, as they sailed over the clear green sea, of a sunny afternoon
  [&quot;The neighbouring inhabitants,&quot; says Dr. Smith, in his History of
  Kerry, speaking of Ballyheigh, &quot;show some rocks visible in this bay only
  at low tides, which<B><I>, </I></B>they say, are the remains of an island,
  that was formerly the burial-place of the family of Cantillon, the ancient
  proprietors of Ballyheigh.&quot; p.210.] However this may be, it is well known
  that the Cantillons were, like most other Irish families, strongly attached to
  their ancient burial-place; and this attachment led to the custom, when any of
  the family died, of carrying the corpse to the sea-side, where the coffin was
  left on the shore within reach of the tide. In the morning it had disappeared,
  being, as was traditionally believed, conveyed away by the ancestors of the
  deceased to their family tomb.</P>

  <P>
Connor Crowe, a county Clare man, was related to the
  Cantillons by marriage. &quot;Connor Mac in Cruagh, of the seven quarters of
  Breintragh,&quot; as he was commonly called, and a proud man he was of the
  name. Connor, be it known, would drink a quart of salt water, for its
  medicinal virtues, before breakfast; and for the same reason, I suppose,
  double that quantity of raw whiskey between breakfast and night, which last he
  did with as little inconvenience to himself as any man in the barony of
  Moyferta; and were I to add Clanderalaw and Ibrickan, I don't think I should
  say wrong.</P>

  <P>
On the death of Florence Cantillon, Connor Crowe was
  determined to satisfy himself about the truth of this story of the old church
  under the sea: so when he heard the news of the old fellow's death, away with
  him to Ardfert, where Flory was laid out in high style, and a beautiful corpse
  he made.</P>

  <P>
Flory had been as jolly and as rollocking a boy in his day as
  ever was stretched, and his wake was in every respect worthy of him. There was
  all kind of entertainment and all sort of diversion at it, and no less than
  three girls got husbands there - more luck to them. Every thing was as it
  should be : all that side of the country, from Dingle to Tarbert, was at the
  funeral. The Keen was sung long and bitterly; and, according to the family
  custom, the coffin was carried to Ballyheigh strand, where it was laid upon
  the shore with a prayer for the repose of the dead.</P>

  <P>
The mourners departed, one group after an-other, and at last
  Connor Crowe was left alone: he then pulled out his whiskey bottle, his drop
  of comfort as he called it, which he required, being in grief; and down he sat
  upon a big stone that was sheltered by a projecting rock, and partly concealed
  from view, to await with patience the appearance of the ghostly undertakers.</P>

  <P>
The evening came on mild and beautiful; he whistled an old air
  which he had heard in his childhood, hoping to keep idle fears out of his
  head; but the wild strain of that melody brought a thousand recollections with
  it, which only made the twilight appear more pensive.</P>

  <P>
&quot;If 't was near the gloomy tower of Dunmore, in my own
  sweet county,. I was,&quot; said Connor Crowe, with a sigh, &quot; one might
  well believe that the prisoners, who were murdered long ago, there in the
  vaults under the castle, would be the hands to carry off the coffin out of
  envy, for never a one of them was buried decently, nor had as much as a coffin
  amongst them all. 'Tis often, sure enough, I have heard lamentations and great
  mourning coming from the vaults of Dunmore Castle; but,&quot; continued he,
  after fondly pressing his lips to the mouth of his companion and silent
  comforter, the whiskey bottle, &quot; didn't I know all the time well enough,
  'twas the dismal sounding waves working through the cliffs and hollows of the
  rocks, and fretting themselves to foam, Oh then, Dunmore Castle, it is you
  that are the gloomy looking tower on a gloomy day, with the gloomy hills
  behind you when one has gloomy thoughts on their heart, and sees you like a
  ghost rising out of the smoke made by the kelp burners on the strand, there
  is, the Lord save us! as fearful a look about you as about the Blue Man's Lake
  at midnight. Well then, any how<I>,&quot; </I>said Connor, after a pause,
  &quot; is it not a blessed night, though surely the moon looks mighty pale in
  the face? St. Senan himself between us and all kinds of harm.&quot;</P>

  <P>
It was, in truth, a lovely moonlight night; no-thing was to be
  seen around but the dark rocks, and the white pebbly beach, upon which the sea
  broke with a hoarse and melancholy murmur. Connor, notwithstanding his
  frequent draughts, felt rather queerish, and almost began to repent his
  curiosity. It was certainly a solemn sight to behold the black coffin resting
  upon the white strand. His imagination gradually converted the deep moaning of
  old ocean into a mournful wail for the dead, and from the shadowy recesses of
  the rocks he imaged forth strange and visionary forms.</P>

  <P>
As the night advanced, Connor became weary with watching; he
  caught himself more than once in the fact of nodding, when suddenly giving his
  head a shake, he would look towards the black coffin. But the narrow house of
  death remained unmoved before him.</P>

  <P>
It was long past midnight, and the moon was sinking into the
  sea, when he heard the sound of many voices, which gradually became stronger,
  above the heavy and monotonous roll of the sea: he listened, and presently
  could distinguish a Keen, of exquisite sweetness, the notes of which rose and
  fell with the heaving of the waves, whose deep murmur mingled with and
  supported the strain !</P>

  <P>
The Keen grew louder and louder, and seemed to approach the
  beach, and then fell into a low plaintive wail. As it ended, Connor beheld a
  number of strange, and in the dim light, mysterious looking figures, emerge
  from the sea, and surround the coffin, which they prepared to launch into the
  water.</P>

  <P>
&quot; This comes of marrying with the creatures of
  earth,&quot; said one of the figures, in a clear, yet hollow tone.</P>

  <P>
&quot;True,&quot; replied another, with a voice still more
  fearful, &quot;our king would never have commanded his gnawing white-toothed
  waves to devour the rocky roots of the island cemetery, had not his daughter,
  Durfulla, been buried there by her mortal husband !&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot; But the time will come,&quot; said a third, bending
  over the coffin.</P>

  <P>
&quot;When mortal eye - our work shall spy,<BR>

  And mortal ear - our dirge shall hear.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Then,&quot; said a fourth, &quot; our burial of the
  Cantillons is at an end for ever !&quot;</P>

  <P>
As this was spoken, the coffin was borne from the beach by a
  retiring wave, and the company of sea people prepared to follow it: but at the
  moment, one chanced to discover Connor Crowe, as fixed with wonder and as
  motionless with fear as the stone on which he sat.</P>

  <P>
&quot;The time is come,&quot; cried the unearthly being,
  &quot;the time is come; a human eye looks on the forms of ocean, a human ear
  has heard their voices; farewell to the Cantillons; the sons of the sea are no
  longer doomed to bury the dust of the earth !&quot;</P>

  <P>
One after the other turned slowly round, and regarded Connor
  Crowe, who still remained as if bound by a spell. Again arose their funeral
  song; and on the next wave they followed the coffin. The sound of the
  lamentation died away, and at length nothing was heard but the rush of waters.
  The coffin and the train of sea people sank over the old church-yard, and
  never, since the funeral of old Flory Cantillon, have any of the family been
  carried to the strand of Ballyheigh, for conveyance to their rightful
  burial-place, beneath the waves of the Atlantic.</P>
