# The Wonderful Tune

  
MAURICE CONNOR was the king, and that's no small word, of all the pipers
in Munster. He could play jig and planxty without end, and Ollistrum's
March, and the Eagle's Whistle, and the Hen's Concert, and odd tunes of
every sort and kind. But he knew one, far more surprising than the rest,
which had in it the power to set every thing dead or alive dancing.

In what way he learned it is beyond my knowledge, for he was mighty
cautious about telling how he came by so wonderful a tune. At the very
first note of that tune, the brogues began shaking upon the feet of all
who heard it - old or young it mattered not -just as if their brogues
had the ague; then the feet began going - going - going from under them,
and at last up and away with them, dancing like mad ! - whisking here,
there, and everywhere, like a straw in a storm - there was no halting
while the music lasted !

Not a fair, nor a wedding, nor a patron in the seven parishes round, was
counted worth the speaking of with out "blind Maurice and his pipes."
His mother, poor woman, used to lead him about from one place to
another, just like a dog.

Down through Iveragh - a place that ought to be proud of itself for 't
is Daniel O'Connell's country - Maurice Connor and his mother were
taking their rounds. Beyond all other places Iveragh is the place for
stormy coast and steep mountains : as proper a spot it is as an in
Ireland to get yourself drowned, or your neck broken on the land, should
you prefer that. But, notwithstanding, in Ballinskellig bay there is a
neat bit of ground, well fitted for diversion, and down from it, towards
the water, is a clean smooth piece of strand - the dead image of a calm
summer's sea on a moonlight night, with just the curl of the small waves
upon it.

Here it was that Maurice's music had brought from all parts a great
gathering of the young men and the young women - *O the darlints !* -
for 'twas not every day the strand of Trafraska was stirred up by the
voice of a bagpipe. The dance began; and as pretty a rinkafadda it was
as ever was danced. "Brave music," said every body, "and well done,"
when Maurice stopped.

"More power to your elbow, Maurice, and a fair wind in the bellows,"
cried Paddy Dorman, a hump-backed dancing-master, who was there to keep
order. " 'Tis a pity," said he, " if we 'd let the piper run dry after
such music; 't would be a disgrace to Iveragh, that didn't come on it
since the week of the three Sundays." So, as well became him, for he was
always a decent man, says he: "Did you drink, piper ?"

" I will, sir," says Maurice, answering the question on the safe side,
for you never yet knew piper or schoolmaster who refused his drink.

"What will you drink, Maurice?" says Paddy.

" I'm no ways particular," says Maurice; "I drink any thing, and give
God thanks, barring *raw* water: but if 'tis all the same to you, mister
Dorman, may be you wouldn't lend me the loan of a glass of whiskey."

"I've no glass, Maurice," said Paddy; " I've only the bottle."

"Let that be no hindrance," answered Maurice; my mouth just holds a
glass to the drop; often I've tried it, sure."

So Paddy Dorman trusted him with the bottle - more fool was he; and, to
his cost, he found that though Maurice's mouth might not hold more than
the glass at one time, yet, owing to the hole in his throat, it took
many a filling.

"That was no bad whiskey neither," says Maurice, handing back the empty
bottle.

"By the holy frost, then !" says Paddy, " 'tis but *could* comfort
there's in that bottle now; and 'tis your word we must take for the
strength of the whiskey, for you've left us no sample to judge by :" and
to be sure Maurice had not.

Now I need not tell any gentleman or lady with common understanding,
that if he or she was to drink an honest bottle of whiskey at one pull,
it is not at all the same thing as drinking a bottle of water; and in
the whole course of my life, I never knew more than five men who could
do so without being overtaken by the liquor. Of these Maurice Connor was
not one, though he had a stiff head enough of his own - he was fairly
tipsy.

Don't think I blame him for it; 'tis often a good man's case; but true
is the word that says, "when liquor's in sense is out;" and puff, at a
breath, before you could say " Lord, save us!" out he blasted his
wonderful tune.

'Twas really then beyond all belief or telling the dancing. Maurice
himself could not keep quiet; staggering now on one leg, now on the
other, and rolling about like a ship in a cross sea, trying to humour
the tune. There was his mother too, moving her old bones as light as the
youngest girl of them all: but her dancing, no, nor the dancing of all
the rest, is not worthy the speaking about to the work that was going on
down upon the strand. Every inch of it covered with all manner of fish
jumping and plunging about to the music, and every moment more and more
would tumble in out of the water, charmed by the wonderful tune. Crabs
of monstrous size spun round and round on one claw with the nimbleness
of a dancing-master, and twirled and tossed their other claws about like
limbs that did not belong to them. It was a sight surprising to behold.
But perhaps you may have heard of father Florence Conry, a Franciscan
friar, and a great Irish poet; *bolg an dana*, as they used to call him
- a wallet of poems. If you have not, he was as pleasant a man as one
would wish to drink with of a hot summer's day; and he has rhymed out
all about the dancing fishes so neatly, that it would be a thousand
pities not to give you his verses ; so here's my hand at an upset of
them into English:

The big seals in motion,  
Like waves of the ocean  
Or gouty feet prancing,  
Came heading the gay fish,  
Crabs, lobsters, and cray fish,  
Determined on dancing.

The sweet sounds they follow'd,  
The gasping cod swallow'd;  
'T was wonderful, really !  
And turbot and flounder,  
'Mid fish that were rounder,  
Just caper'd as gaily.

John-dories came tripping;  
Dull hake by their skipping  
To frisk it seem'd given;  
Bright mackrel went springing,  
like small rainbows winging  
Their flight up to heaven.

The whiting and haddock  
Left salt water paddock  
This dance to be put in:  
Where skate with flat faces  
Edged out some odd plaices;  
But soles kept their footing.

Sprats and herrings in powers  
Of silvery showers  
All number out-number'd.  
And great ling so lengthy  
Were there in such plenty  
The shore was encumber'd.

The scollop and oyster  
Their two shells did roister,  
Like castanets fitting;  
While limpets moved clearly,  
And rocks very nearly  
With laughter were splitting.

 

Never was such an ullabulloo in this world, before or since; 'twas as if
heaven and earth were coming together; and all out of Maurice Connor's
wonderful tune !

In the height of all these doings, what should there be dancing among
the outlandish set of fishes but a beautiful young woman - as beautiful
as the dawn of day I She had a cocked hat upon her head; from under it
her long green hair - just the colour of the sea - fell down behind,
without hinderance to her dancing. Her teeth were like rows of pearl;
her lips for all the world looked like red coral; and she had an elegant
gown, as white as the foam of the wave, with little rows of purple and
red sea weeds settled out upon it: for you never yet saw a lady, under
the water or over the water, who had not a good notion of dressing
herself out.

Up she danced at last to Maurice, who was flinging his feet from under
him as fast as hops - for nothing in this world could keep still while
that tune of his was going on - and says she to him, chaunting it out
with a voice as sweet as honey -

" I'm a Iady of honour  
Who live in the sea;  
Come down, Maurice Connor,  
And be married to me.

"Sliver plates and gold dishes  
You shall have, and shall be  
The king of the fishes,  
When you 're married to me."

Drink was strong in Maurice's head, and out he chaunted in return for
her great civility. It is not every lady, may be, that would be after
making such an offer to a blind piper; therefore 'twas only right in him
to give her as good as she gave herself - so says Maurice,

I'm obliged to you, madam :  
Off a gold dish or plate,  
If a king, and I had 'em,  
I could dine in great state.

With your own father's daughter  
I'd be sure to agree;  
But to drink the salt water  
Wouldn't do so with me ! "

The lady looked at him quite amazed, and swinging her head from side to
side like a great scholar, "Well," says she, " Maurice, if you're not a
poet, where is poetry to be found?"

In this way they kept on at it, framing high compliments; one answering
the other, and their feet going with the music as fast as their tongues.
All the fish kept dancing too: Maurice heard the clatter, and was afraid
to stop playing lest it might be displeasing to the fish, and not
knowing what so many of them may take it into their heads to do to him
if they got vexed.

Well, the lady with the green hair kept on coaxing of Maurice with soft
speeches, till at last she overpersuaded him to promise to marry her,
and be king over the fishes, great and small. Maurice was well fitted to
be their king, if they wanted one that could make them dance; and he
surely would drink, barring the salt water, with any fish of them all.

When Maurice's mother saw him, with that unnatural thing in the form of
a green-haired lady as his guide, and he and she dancing down together
so lovingly: to the water's edge, through the thick of the fishes, she
called out after him to stop and come back. "Oh then," says she, "as if
I was not widow enough before, there he is going away from me to be
married to that scaly woman. And who knows but 'tis grandmother I may be
to a hake or a cod - Lord help and pity me, but 'tis a mighty unnatural
thing! - and may be 'tis boiling and eating my own grandchild I'll be,
with a bit of salt butter, and I not knowing it ! - Oh Maurice, Maurice,
if there's any love or nature left in you, come back to your own *ould*
mother, who reared you like a decent Christian ! "

Then the poor woman began to cry and ullagoane so finely that it would
do any one good to hear her.

Maurice was not long getting to the rim of the water; there he kept
playing and dancing on as if nothing was the matter, and a great
thundering wave coming in towards him' ready to swallow him up alive;
but as he could not see it, he did not fear it. His mother it was who
saw it plainly through the big tears that were rolling down her cheeks;
and though she saw it, and her heart was aching as much as ever mother's
heart ached for a son, she kept dancing, dancing, all the time for the
bare life of her. Certain it was she could not help it, for Maurice
never stopped playing that wonderful tune of his.

He only turned the bothered ear to the sound of his mother's voice,
fearing it might put him out in his steps, and all the answer be made
back was - "Whisht with you, mother - sure I'm going to be king over the
fishes down in the sea, and for a token of luck, and a sign that I'm
alive and well, I'll send you in, every twelvemonth on this day, a piece
of burned wood to Trafraska." Maurice had not the power to say a word
more, for the strange lady with the green hair seeing the wave just upon
them, covered him up with herself in a thing like a cloak with a big
hood to it, and the wave curling over twice as high as their heads,
burst upon the strand, with a rush and a roar that might be heard as far
as Cape Clear.

That day twelvemonth the piece of burned wood came ashore in Trafraska.,
It was a queer thing for Maurice to think of sending all the way from
the bottom of the sea. A gown or a pair of shoes would have been
something like a present for his poor mother; but he had said it, and he
kept his word. The bit of burned wood regularly came ashore on the
appointed day for as good, ay, and better than a hundred years. The day
is now forgotten, and may be that is the reason why people say how
Maurice Connor has stopped sending the luck-token to his mother. Poor
woman, she did not live to get as much as one of them; for what through
the loss of Maurice, and the fear of eating her own grandchildren, she
died in three weeks after the dance - some say it was the fatigue that
killed her, but whichever it was, Mrs. Connor was decently buried with
her own people.

Seafaring men have often heard, off the coast of Kerry, on a still
night, the sound of music coming up from the water; and some, who have
had good ears, could plainly distinguish Maurice Connor's voice singing
these words to his pipes: -

Beautiful shore, with thy spreading strand,  
Thy crystal water, and diamond sand;  
Never would I have parted from thee  
But *for* the sake of my fair ladie.\[a\]

 

\[a\] This is almost a literal translation of a Rann in the well-known
song of Deardra.
