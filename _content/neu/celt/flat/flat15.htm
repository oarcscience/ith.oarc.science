<CENTER><H1>The Field of Boliauns</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
TOM FITZPATRICK was the eldest son of a comfortable farmer who
  lived at Ballincollig. Tom was just turned of nine-and-twenty, when he met the
  following adventure, and was as clever, clean, tight, good-looking a boy as
  any in the whole county Cork. One fine day in harvest - it was indeed Lady-day
  in harvest, that every body knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the
  year - Tom was taking a ramble through the ground, and went sauntering along
  the sunny side of a hedge, thinking in himself, where would be the great harm
  if people, instead of idling and going about doing nothing at all, were to
  shake out the hay, and bind and stook the oats that was lying on the ledge,
  especially as the weather had been rather broken of late, he all of a sudden
  heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him, in the hedge. &quot; Dear
  me,&quot; said Tom,&quot; but isn't it surprising to hear the stonechatters
  singing so late in the season?&quot; So Tom stole on, going on the tops of his
  toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise, to see if he
  was right in his guess. The noise stopped; but as Tom looked sharply through
  the bushes, what should he see in a nook of the hedge but a brown pitcher that
  might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor; and by and by a little wee
  diny dony bit of an old man, with a little <I>motty </I>of a cocked hat stuck
  upon the top of his head, and a deeshy daushy leather apron hanging before
  him, pulled out a little wooden stool, and stood up upon it and dipped a
  little piggin into the pitcher, and took out the full of it, and put it beside
  the stool, and then sat down under the pitcher, and began to work at putting a
  heel-piece on a bit of a brogue just fitting for himself. &quot; Well, by the
  powers !&quot; said Tom to himself, &quot; I often heard tell of the
  Cluricaune; and, to tell God's truth, I never rightly believed in them - but
  here's one of them in real earnest. If I go knowingly to work, I 'm a made
  man. They say a body must never take their eyes off them, or they'll
  escape.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Tom now stole on a little farther, with his eye fixed on the
  little man just as a cat does with a mouse, or, as we read in hooks, the
  rattle-snake does with the birds he wants to enchant. So when he got up quite
  close to him, &quot;God bless your work, neighbour,&quot; said Tom.</P>

  <P>
The little man raised up his head, and &quot;Thank you
  kindly,&quot; said he.</P>

  <P>
&quot;I wonder you'd be working on the holy-day ?&quot; said
  Tom.</P>

  <P>
&quot;That's my own business, not yours,&quot; was the reply.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Well, may be you 'd be civil enough to tell <I>us </I>what
  you 've got in the pitcher there?&quot; said Tom.</P>

  <P>
&quot;That I will, with pleasure,&quot; said he : &quot;it 's
  good beer.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Beer !&quot; said Tom: &quot; Thunder and fire ! where
  did you get it ?&quot;'</P>

  <P>
&quot;Where did I get it, is it? Why, I made it, And what do
  you think I made it of ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Devil a one of me knows,&quot; said Tom, but of malt, I
  suppose; what else?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;There you 're out. I made it of <I>heath</I>.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Of heath !&quot; said Tom, bursting out laughing: &quot;
  sure you don't think me to be such a fool as to believe that?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Do as you please,&quot; said he, &quot;but what I tell
  you is the truth. Did you never hear tell of the Danes ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;And that I did,&quot; said Tom: &quot;weren't <I>them </I>the
  fellows we gave such a <I>licking </I>when they thought to take Limerick from
  us ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Hem !&quot; said the little man drily -&quot; is that
  all<I> </I>you know about the matter?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Well, but about <I>them </I>Danes?&quot; said Tom.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Why, all the about them there is, is that when they were
  here they taught us to make beer out of the heath, and the secret 's in my
  family ever since.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Will you give a body a taste of your beer?&quot; said
  Tom.</P>

  <P>
&quot;I 'II tell you what it is, young man - it would be
  fitter for you to be looking after your father's property than to be bothering
  decent, quiet people with your foolish questions. There now, while you 're
  idling away your time here, there 's the cows have broke into the oats, and
  are knocking the corn all about.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Tom was taken so by surprise with this, that he was just on
  the very point of turning round when he recollected himself; so, afraid that
  the like might happen again, he made a <I>grab </I>* [grasp] at the
  Cluricaune, and caught him up in his hand; but in his hurry he overset the
  pitcher, and spilt all the beer, so that he could not get a taste of it to
  tell what sort it was. He then swore what he would not do to him if he did not
  show him where his money was. Tom looked so wicked and so bloody-minded, that
  the little man was quite frightened; so, says he, &quot; Come along with me a
  couple of fields off, and I'll show you a crock of gold.&quot; So they went,
  and Tom held the Cluricaune fast in his hand, and never took his eyes from off
  him, though they had to cross hedges, and ditches, and a crooked bit of bog
  (for the Cluricaune seemed, out of pure mischief, to pick out the hardest and
  most contrary way), till at last they came to a great field all full of
  boliaun buies (ragweed), and the Cluricaune pointed to a big boliaun, and,
  says he, &quot;Dig under that boliaun, and you'll get the great crock all full
  of guineas.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Tom in his hurry had never minded the bringing a spade with
  him, so he thought to run home and fetch one; and that he might know the place
  again, he took off one of his red garters, and tied it round the boliaun.</P>

  <P>
&quot;I suppose,&quot; said the Cluricaune, very civilly,
  &quot; you've no farther occasion for me ?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;No,&quot; says Tom &quot;you may go away now, if you
  please, and God speed you, and may good luck attend you wherever you go.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Well, goodbye to you, Tom Fitzpatrick,&quot; said the
  Cluricaune, &quot;and much good may do you, with what you'll get.&quot;</P>

  <P>
So Tom ran, for the dear life, till he came home, and got a
  spade, and then away with him, as hard as he could go, back to the field of
  boliauns; but when he got there, lo, and behold ! not a boliaun in the field
  but had a red garter, the very identical model of his own, tied about it; and
  as to digging up the whole field, that was all nonsense, for there was more
  than forty good Irish acres in it. So Tom came home again with his spade on
  his shoulder, a little cooler than he went; and many's the hearty curse he
  gave the Cluricaune every time he thought of the neat turn he had served him.</P>

  Notes<BR>

  --------</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <P>
The following is the account given by Lady Morgan. of the
  Cluricaune or Leprechan, in her excellent novel of O'Dommell (Vol.11. p. 246.)
  which has been referred to in a preceding note.</P>

  <P>
&quot;It would he extremely difficult,&quot; says her lady
  ship;&quot; to class this supernatural agent, who holds a distinguished place
  in the Irish fairies.' His appearance, however, is supposed to he that of a
  shrivelled little old man, whose presence marks a spot where hidden treasures
  lie concealed, which were buried there in ' <I>the troubles.' </I>He is
  therefore generally seen in lone and dismal places, out of the common haunts
  of man and though the night wanderer may endeavour to mark the place where he
  beheld the guardian of the treasures perched, yet when he returns in the
  morning with proper implements to turn up the earth, the thistle, stone, or
  branch he had placed as a mark is so multiplied, that it is no longer a
  distinction and the disappointments occasioned by the malignity of the little
  Leprechan render him a very unpopular fairy: his name is never applied but as
  a term of contempt.&quot;</P>

  <P>
On this extract it should be remarked, that the word <I>Prechan,
  </I>used in the story of the young piper and explained in the note as a
  contraction of Leprechan, may signify a raven, and is metaphorically applied
  to any nonsensical chatterer; - this word is correctly written, <I>Pr&#232;acha'n,
  </I>or <I>Pri&#224;chan.</P>

  </I>
  <P>
The ancients imagined that treasures buried in the earth were
  guarded by spirits called Incubones, and that if you seized their cap, you
  compelled them to deliver this wealth. See Pomponius Sabinus, line 507.
  Georgics 2.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Sed ut dicunt ego nihil scio, sed audivi, quomodo
  Incuboni pileum rapuisset et thesaurum invenit,&quot; are the words of
  Petronius, an author of whom Lady Morgan is of course ignorant.</P>


<P>
The English reader will perhaps he surprised
to see the term <I>boy</I> applied to a young man of nine-and-twenty; but in
Ireland this word is commonly used as equivalent to young man, much as the word
P L V &quot;; was employed by the Greeks, and <I>puer, </I>still more abusively,
by the Romans; as, for example, in the first Eclogue of Virgil: Tityrus, who
represents Augustus as replying to his application for protection from the
soldiery - &quot; Pascite ut ante boves <I>pueri,&quot; </I>is immediately
addressed by the other shepherd - &quot; Fortunate <I>senex.&quot; </I>Spenser
also employs It in the same sense for he calls Prince Arthur's squire Timias <I>a
lusty</I> <I>boy; </I>and Spenser, except in his finals, is good authority. Mr.
Wordsworth, too, whose logical correctness in the use of words is notorious,
does not scruple, among the employments which his &quot;Old Adam&quot; assumed
on coming to London, to mention that of an &quot; errand <I>boy</I>.&quot;<I> </I>It
may, perhaps, he safely asserted, that our shoals of continental travellers do
not always find the <I>garcon</I> at a French hotel or caff&#279; to he an <I>imberbis
puer. </I>It is treading on tender ground to presume to censure Miss Edgeworth,
but it might possibly be queried whether in her tale of &quot;Ormond&quot; she
has not o'erstepped the modesty of nature when she makes King Corny qualify the
tough ploughman with the title of boy, though, indeed, this is a point that may
admit of doubt; for the devil himself; who, all agree, is no chicken, is very
commonly styled the &quot; <I>Old boy</I>.&quot;</P>


<P>
It is a generally received tradition in the south of lreland,
that the Dane's manufactured a kind of intoxicating beer from the heath. Dr.
Smith, in his History of Kerry (p. 173), informs us that &quot; the country
people&quot; of the southern part of the barony of Corckaguiny &quot; are
possessed with an opinion that most of the old fences in these wild mountains
were the work of the ancient Danes, and that they made a kind of beer of the
heath which grows there; but these enclosures are more modern than the time when
that northern nation inhabited Ireland. Many of them,&quot; continues the
doctor, &quot;were made to secure cattle from wolves, which animals were not
entirely extirpated until about the year 1710; as I find by the presentments for
raising money for destroying them in some old grand jury books; and the more
ancient enclosures were made about corn fields, which were more numerous before
the importation of potatoes into Ireland than at present.&quot;</P>

<P>
Dr. Smith may be right in his conjectures respecting the fences
which he has described, though these will by no means apply to the low stone
lines which are to he seen on many of the mountains in Muskerry, in the county
Cork, and which were obviously never intended for enclosures, but for mere
boundaries, or marks of property the stones are placed in regular lines, and are
certainly not the remains of walls, as they consist of only one layer of atones.
It is also to be remarked, that the enclosures are too small and too numerous to
indicate a division of land for ordinary purposes; and their use can only be
explained by supposing (as we have every reason to do) that they were intended
to mark out the bounds within which each man cut his portion of heath.</P>

<I>
<P>
Gwr&#225;ch </I>is the Welsh name for a hag or witch, and <I>Gwr&#225;ch
y Rhibyn </I>signifies the hag of the dribble, a personage, according to
Cambrian tradition, who caused the many <I>dribbles of stones </I>seen on the
slopes of the mountains. This phrase happily expresses the boundaries just
described. The legend of <I>Gwr&#225;ch y Rhibyn </I>states, that in her journeys
over the hills, she was wont to carry her apron full of stones; and by chance,
when the string of her apron broke, a dribble was formed.</P>

<P>
Tom Fitspatrick, the hero of the tale, does not seem to have
been a very profound antiquary; and a case of similar ignorance in a respectable
farmer may he quoted. This farmer lived within less than fifty miles of
Londonderry ; and yet, to a question addressed to him by a gentleman about the
Danes, he replied in the very words of Tom, only substituting Derry for
Limerick, In justice to the writer's countrymen, it must he, however, declared,
that such ignorance is by no means common among them. They well know who the
Danes were, and will tell you very gravely that a father in Denmark, when
bestowing hia daughter in marriage, always assigns with her, as a portion, some
of the lands which his ancestors had possessed in Ireland. It would be rather
curious to ascertain whether the Northumbrians and the peasants of the East
Riding retain so distinct an idea of these northern invaders.</P>

<P>
&quot;<I>Dear me</I>,&quot; <I>and to tell God's truth,&quot; </I>says
Tom and the narrator says Tom ran for the &quot; <I>dear life</I> :&quot; these
are odd expressions will say, perhaps, the reader, Not at all, <I>Dear </I>is
almost exactly the Homeric f i l o V and is a strong expression of the
possessive pronoun, and is frequently so employed by Spenser and the elder
writers; and, by <I>God's truth, </I>an Irish man means the truth, pure and
unmixed as it is in the Divinity, &quot; the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth,&quot; or the truth as it should be uttered in the presence of the
Divinity.</P>

<P>
The three original diminutives are <I>tiny, dony, </I>and the
Scottish <I>wee, </I>By variously combining the elements of these, the Irish
make a variety of others, Thus, from the first and third they form <I>weeny, </I>and
by the use of the termination <I>shy, </I>they make <I>deeshy, doshhy, </I>and <I>weeshey.</P>

</I>
<P>
A <I>piggin</I> is a wooden vessel of a cylindrical form, made
of staves hooped together, with one of the staves of double the length of the
others, which serves for a handle. They are of various sizes, containing from a
pint to two gallons, according to the uses for which they are intended. In
Leinster there is a distinction made between those of a larger, and those of a
smaller, size. The former are called <I>piggins</I>, the latter <I>noggins</I>.
In the same province, the pewter measure answering to the English <I>gill </I>is
called a <I>naggin. </I>Vide Gough's Arithmetic (Dublin, 1810) In the southern
counties, the terms naggin and noggin are used indifferently, as before
mentioned.</P>
